All this and more at the top of the hour. But first, something to start the day off right.

What kind of problems? [Adam] He wouldn't get into specifics. Maybe couldn't handle the pressure of telling his family, so he offed himself, I once had a gay friend that did that. Yeah, or we could always go the traditional route, you know, him and this guy have some sort of torrid love affair and things escalate, boom, crime of passion. -So overdone. -She's right. We need something fresh, something that'll get people wet. Okay, fresh and wet. Done. Let's do this. Keep that. Oh, that's terrible. So... ...we gonna talk about last night? [Robin] What about it? They were waiting for you. I had a headache. A headache? [sighs] I'm worried about you. I'm fine. [cellphone vibrating] Have you heard back from Patterson? Not yet. Might wanna follow up this afternoon. [cellphone vibrating] You gonna get that? No, it's, um... Okay, -later. -Bye. [knocking] What? [Casey] Ms. Walker, sorry to interrupt, your brother's on the line. Tell him I'm busy. He says it's urgent. Hey, I'm at work, can I call you back later? Listen, Garrett, now's not really a good time. [melancholic music] [train engine revving] [crickets chirping] [footsteps approaching] Robin. Parker. [Robin sighs] I'm so sorry. How's she doing? She's okay. Your brother's been looking after her. [Robin] Oh, this should be fun. [melancholic music] Hello? -I'll take this upstairs. -Thanks. [footsteps receding] [sighs] Hey, Mom. [Diane] What took you so long? Hey. Hey, sis. So how was your trip? It was good. Good. I'm sorry I didn't take you up on your offer, -I just had some stuff that I had to finish. -[Garret] Oh, no-- I figured, it's cool, I was trying to help. -[Parker] Is red okay? -Oh, I'm okay, thank you, Parker. Oh, I will take hers. Thank you, Parker. [Parker] Of course. You still in that place downtown? The exposed brick and a couple of claw foots? Yeah. [chuckles] You guys are in Liberty, right? No. This guy's having the most tremendous year. -Well. -It's amazing. I'm very proud of you. We've moved to York. Nice. You should swing by some time and see the place. Yes. Yeah, for sure, I'd like that. So where's, uh, Violet? I've been calling, Robin, I left her a million messages. She will show up. She always does. Now how about you? How is everything? I barely recognize you, it's been so long. I'm good, Mom. Good. That's what I get, Parker, good. How's Brian? He's good. [chuckles softly] I'm gonna head upstairs, I think, and make a few phone calls. -Enjoy the rest of-- -There's a towel on the bed for you. Thanks. [chuckles] [somber music] [Garrett] Fuck, I was an ugly kid. That was a good day at the farm. -What's his name? -The horse? -Yeah. -I don't remember. I think I called it Assie or something. Like, I thought it was a donkey. -Assie? -I thought it was a donkey. How old are you? You called this thing -Assie? -Yes. [Robin] That's so inappropriate. Ah, Violet, she was a cute baby. She always had her tongue out like Michael Jordan. Her big eyes. It's cute. I think I was eating sand. [Garrett] I think I had a mullet. [chuckles softly] Aw, Mom will love this one. [Robin sighs] Hey, I'm gonna head to bed. Do you need anything? Mom? Hey, are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. [sighs] Twenty-four years I was with that man. I'd say you had a pretty good run. Guess so. Damn, there's still so many things that we wanted to do. [exhales deeply] So, tell me about Brian. He's a... ...he's a really great guy. Does he make you happy? Yeah, he does. You gonna set a date? We're actually still trying to figure some things out, so not yet. Well, you let me know. Got nothing but time on my hands these days. Hey... ...look what we found. It's a nice photo of me, Garrett and Dad. [somber music] [Robin] We wanted to put some photos around for the wake. That's a good idea. I'm glad you're back. [dramatic music] [church bells ringing] [bells continue ringing] [muffled chatter on radio] [muffled laughter] [indistinct chatter] Robin, this is Ellie. Ellie, this is my sister, Robin. So nice to finally meet you. It's nice to meet you too. Oh. Sorry for your loss. He was a great guy. I'm an old friend of the family's. -Mm. -[chuckles] So the boys here were telling me that you're some sort of reporter. I've always had a real interest in that field. It's great that you have had the guts to go and do that. [Robin] Thanks. It's been a while. Sorry to interrupt, I just wanted to come by and offer my condolences. I think you should leave. Why don't I show you out? Oh, she can show herself out. It was nice meeting you guys. Who let her in? Mm, I did, she said she was your friend. Okay, that woman is not allowed on this property. [sighs] [gentle piano music] [Robin] Any updates on the kid? [Tiffany] Adam's on it. And what about Patterson? Don't worry, I'm taking care of everything. Just focus on the funeral. Well, that sounds healthy. Relax. Work will be here when you get back. I gotta run. You're doing great. Yeah, okay, I'll talk to you later. Bye. [man] Robin Walker. Officer. Robbie Walker. Look at you, all grown up. -How you been? -Good. Yeah, I've been good. Sorry about your father. Thank you. I mean, boys at the station are pretty torn up about it. Mind if I join? Actually, I'm just about to head out. How long you in town? Just till the funeral. Ah, of course. Your father, toughest man I've ever known. Some of the stuff he had to deal with. Just know that we're here for you. You need anything... Family holding up okay? Kyle and Violet? Garrett. Garrett, right, sorry. They're good. Oh, please give them my best. Of course. Great to see you. You too. [footsteps receding] [gentle piano music] [seagulls squawking] [Dylan clears throat] Can I help you with something? Dylan. -Robin Walker. -[chuckles] [laughs] Long time no see. So, what, you lose my number? Come here. [chuckles] I'm sorry to hear about your dad. How you holding up? -I'm all right. -Yeah? How've you been? Same old. We should grab a drink, catch up. Yeah, I'd like that. Actually, I'm looking for my sister. Is she around? Ah, yeah. You just missed her. By two months, actually. We did some restructuring. Budget cuts or something. So, she was fired? [chuckles] Yeah, my supervisor prefers the term let go. You know where I can find her? Uh... Yeah.

So how long have you been doing this? Few months now. Dad's funeral is Tuesday morning. Yeah, I know, I can't come. I have to work. Strippers work mornings? I have another job. In case you didn't notice earlier, I'm pretty flexible. It's your father's funeral. [sighs] I can moralize my dad on my own.

Well, she's an adult now, she can make her own decisions. So you approve of our little sister taking her clothes off for a living? I mean, it's not ideal, but she's old enough to do what she wants. Oh, come on, Garrett. What? She's a smart girl. She'll figure things out. How are you okay with this? I'm not. I'm just saying-- No, what you're saying is that you think we should continue to let our little sister fuck up her life. That's, that's what you're saying. I'm being supportive. Yeah, you're being supportive. Robin, you left. You did too. [sighs] [crickets chirping] [door slides opens] [Parker] Hey. Beautiful night. [chuckles] Water warm? Love you. Did my brother send you out here? Yeah. No. No, he didn't. You and Brian went to Mexico recently, didn't you? Morocco. Close enough. [chuckles] How is he? He's good. -Yeah? -Yeah. What gave it away? Sorry, I-- it's-- Hmm, you're not wearing your ring anymore. Let's just not tell Garrett, okay? Totally, yeah. How long has it been? Three months now. Sorry. Sucks.

You know, I don't, I don't know if you've ever noticed this, but, uh, Garrett, like, he's a little bit stubborn sometimes. -Oh, no, I didn't notice. -Yeah, yeah. Maybe it's like a new thing... [both chuckle] ...just with me. It's good, we're good. -Good. -Yeah. You guys seem to really have your shit together. Yeah. I, I don't think anyone really has their shit together. It's, like, it's really just all one big act. You think? Oh, yeah. For sure. Like, are you the same person at home as you are at work? [gentle music] No. No, at work, I actually like myself. Right? Why is that? You know, you're doing better than you think. See you in there. [gentle music] Was your mom not joining us? No, she's not feeling well. Is Brian joining us? Uh, he's actually not going to be able to make it. He's not gonna make the funeral? Yeah, work's just been crazy for him. -[scoffs] -Garrett, can you pass me the bread? -What? -No, nothing. -Oh, no, please, tell me whatever it is you're thinking. -Thank you. I just think it's a little fucked up your fiancé can't make it for your dad's funeral. [Parker] Yeah, well, I'm-- I mean, it happens. I'm sure if he could be here, he would be. [Garrett] You couldn't be here, but look, you're here. -Yeah, it's different. -How is it different? I, I think I'm a little bit closer to the family. -And I think that's okay. -Yeah, well, the fact that you have a relationship is already different. -No, you're right, you're right. -I'm a little bit closer.

He left me, okay? -Oh, fuck. -If you don't, if you don't make an effort to, to-- [Dylan clears throat] So, how things go with your sister? Well, she's uh, she's kind of a bitch. Yeah, well, that sounds like Violet. Nice, Kate. So, to old friendships? Come on, what are you, a lightweight now? Come on. Oh, all right, I forget you're a big city girl now. Mm-hmm. [Dylan grunts] What's that like, by the way? It's good. What's the Marina like? It's good. Yeah? Yeah. [Dylan chuckles] So what do you do for fun? I don't really have time for fun. Uh-huh? So you're not having fun right now? Okay, then, I think it's still my shot though, so... You've gotta be kidding me. What? [scoffs] Do you know this lady or? -Robin? -Ellie. So good to see you. This must be the lucky guy. No, no. Ellie, this is Dylan. He's a good friend of mine. -Hi. -Oh, okay. [chuckles] Well, if you don't lock this guy down, I might have to. [both chuckle] Wow. So how do you guys know each other? It's a long story. [laughs] Hey. Oh, no, I'm okay, thank you. No, please, it's on me. [chuckles] Cheers. Oh. Um, I'm going to be in town for a few days. Maybe you could, um... ...I don't know, we could go out for coffee. -Yeah, yeah, I'd like that. -Yeah? [chuckles] You can call me anytime. -Whenever. -Sounds great. Okay. Nice meeting you. Likewise. Bye. [chuckles] [both laugh] So what's her story? I honestly have no idea. Wow. -Oh. -Okay, come on. -Let's get out of here. -Okay. [Robin laughs] [somber music] -[laughs] -[Dylan] Be quiet. [shushes] -[Robin] Okay, let me down. -[Dylan] No, it's fine. -[Robin] Used to get it. -[Dylan] Yeah, we're not doing... -[Robin laughs] -[beep] Are you gonna get fired for this? Not funny. Only if we get caught. [hushes loudly] [Dylan grunts] Okay. -Wanna go for a swim? -No, no, no. [laughs] -[laughs] Dylan! -You, you... [laughs] -[both laugh loudly] -I was lost in... [laughs] Nice. It's nice to have you back. I'm glad at least one person's happy to see me. Hm. [chuckles] What? Nothing. Tell me. You're holding my hand. Mm-hmm. That's very perceptive of you. [chuckles] Dylan, you're a really great guy. But? But... ...I don't know, I mean, we just, we go so far back. Yeah. Yeah, we do. I read something once, it said, uh, "Love is friendship on fire." That's the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard. [both chuckle] Yeah, yeah, it is. So, you miss me? -Yeah, I did. -Mm-hmm. Yeah, you should visit more often. You should move to the city. Only if you show me around. What do you want to see? It's a secret. [chuckles] [gentle music] I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't have done that. No, it's fine, it's just, um... It's okay. It's just that... [clears throat softly] ...things are just really messed up right now. With, uh, Brian and my family. It's late, I should get back. I have a wake to prepare for. Can I walk you back? Nah, I'll be fine. Sure? Yeah. See you around. Hey. [Brian] Robin? Robin, it's 2:00 a.m. I know, I just, uh... Sorry. I, I don't know why I'm calling you actually. -[Brian] Is everything okay? -Yeah, yeah, I just, um... Brian, I just really need to see you. -[Brian] Robin. -I know it's stupid, but... I miss you, and things have just been really shitty lately. [Brian] I'm sorry to hear that. You think we can meet up this week? I just want to talk. [Brian] Robin... ...sorry, but I'm not that person for you anymore. [melancholic music] [Brian] You there? Yeah. [Brian] Take care, okay? [footsteps approaching] [laughing] Okay, I'll be outside. Okay? Hey. Everything okay? Can call you a cab? [chuckles] I'm sorry. No, don't be sorry. Never apologize for how you feel. Your feelings are the one thing no one can ever take away from you. Well, I wish they could. You're okay. I just don't know what's wrong with me. Mm. I promise you, it'll all get better. You can't promise that. I'm still here, aren't I? It just doesn't make sense. So much time trying to make sense of things. Am I pretty enough? Am I happy enough? Am I wealthy enough? Why did my husband leave me? Things don't always make sense. Truth is, everyone's just walking around with no idea what the heck they're doing. All you can do is make the best of what you're given. Just one day at a time. [calm music] Sorry. Let's get you home. [chuckles] Well, somebody had some fun for once. [sighs] You know you have a bed inside, right? You going somewhere? Can I borrow your car again? Can you start paying insurance? Or just get the keys by the door. That's cool too. Hey, tomorrow I was thinking of going to the boat with Parker. -Do you want to come? -Yeah, I'll see you there. Good chat. [chuckles softly] It's nice to see you back in the garden again. You talked to your sister? Yeah. How's she doing? She's good. She's just been very busy with work. She gonna make it to the funeral on Tuesday? She will be there. Good. Will be nice to have the family all back under one roof. Hey, Mom, I got to ask... What's up with you and Ellie? Just stay away from her. Why? Because I said so. Good talk. [gentle music] [indistinct chattering on radio] [male reporter on radio] An entire population of 8,000 is off to run for the city on fire. All places are being evacuated... [Tiffany] So how'd it go with Violet? [Robin] She's a fucking nightmare. [Tiffany] She's your sister. I can't wait to get the hell out of this place. [Tiffany] You'll be back in the city before you know it. Just try and enjoy the time you have with your family. Yeah, sure. I mean, maybe me and Violet can bond over a glass of wine and she can teach me some of her dance moves. [Tiffany] Hey, that doesn't sound too bad. [door opens] Oh, shit, I gotta go. You gotta be kidding me. I, I just want to talk. I have nothing to say to you. What do you want from me? Your family needs you. Oh, my family needs me? Yeah. What about when I needed you, huh? And you just ran off. You know, as soon as dad got the diagnosis, both you and Garrett ran. I got to watch our father's slow, drawn out death. -I'm sorry. -You're sorry? Yeah, what else do you want me to say? You left me here alone. Okay, to deal with our fucked up family. You don't get to just waltz in here and say you're sorry. It doesn't work like that Robin. [sighs] [scoffs] Yeah. Yeah, it feels pretty fucking shitty, doesn't it? You're getting a little bit of a taste of what I've been through for the last six years. You know what? I'm not going to that fucking funeral because I've done enough. Okay, so you go, yeah, you go and you sit there and you look pretty for the both of us. It's your turn. -I'm sorry. -What? I'm sorry. [crying] [calm music] Welcome to my crib. It's cute. Isn't it? So, do you live here alone? No, me and my roommate share the basement. Some old guy, I think his name is Derek, lives upstairs. Oh, that doesn't sound too bad. Yeah. No, they're, they're lovely. Jenna works with me at the club. The old guy's getting investigated for child pornography. I'm kidding. Kinda. Okay, seriously. When are you going to escape to the city? And do what? Sleep on the streets? I can't afford the city. Well, you know, you can always stay with me until you find a job. I didn't realize we were on that level. We used to be. What happened? You moved to the city and became an asshole. Are you going to say anything at the funeral? What's that? Dad's funeral. You're going to say anything? No, that's not really my thing. But if there's a pole there, you know, I might whip out some moves, really spice it up. Shit. What? You've gotta be kidding me.

Um, yeah, you're right. -Probably not. -Probably not. I mean, the idea of it's nice. Yeah, it's really nice until they leave you. Or die. -True. -Yeah, true. How long have you guys been together now? -Uh, well, it's like-- -[Violet chuckles] -There's a blur. -No, it's-- Yeah, it's a blur. -Well, there's blurry... -[Garret] There's blurry parts. -There's blurry patches though where we were like, yeah... -Yeah. ...like two years. But there's sections, there's sections where we weren't like, I don't know. -It's okay, like-- -There's ups and downs. -Yeah, exactly. -Lefts and rights. And uh... Sorry. It's okay, it's okay.

[clears throat] What is something you've never told anyone before? -[Garret] Ask me anything. -[Violet] Okay. Have you ever shoplifted? -[Garret] Nope. -Fucked a teacher? I'm not you, Vi, I get my grades the old fashioned way. [chuckles] Fair. Come on, nothing? Everybody has secrets. All right. What are yours, tough guy? [Robin] Garrett doesn't have secrets. Because he's perfect. -Mm-hmm. -Hmm. You're one to talk. Little miss sunshine. If anybody's perfect, it's you. [scoffs] Yeah, okay, well... Perfect people don't want to jump off bridges. So... [Parker] Garrett is perfect, because he's volunteered to wake up early and make us breakfast. Robin... Okay, whose turn is it now? -Parker's? -[Garret] Robin. You're kidding, right? [scoffs] Okay, if you were having problems of that degree, then you should've said something. To who, you? My little brother? If we'd have known, maybe we could have done something to help you. Like what? Don't worry, I'm fine, okay? Does anybody want anything else to drink? No, I'm good. [chuckles] Do you really think more alcohol is a good idea right now? Oh, God, what are you, my father? Oh, no, wait, he's dead. [scoffs] Robin. What? I'm just trying to lighten the mood. Why don't we ask Garrett what he thinks of our dad? Robin, you're drunk. You have no right. -Oh, fuck off. -[Violet] Guys, enough. What's your problem? My problem? With what exactly? Dad. Why do you hate him so much? I'm not doing this with you right now. Come on. What did Dad ever do to you? Besides treating me like a defect, gee, I don't know, sis. Garrett, he never said that. No, but we all know he was thinking it, don't we? Dad was conservative, okay. It took him just a little bit longer to-- Robin, shut up. You need help. Clinical fucking help. [Violet] Garrett, let it go. "Garrett, let it go." All right. -[Violet] Garrett, come on. -[Garret] Fuck you. [Parker] It's okay. He just... needs, needs a moment. [pill bottle rattles] So how many of those are you supposed to take? I'm gonna go. How long has this been going on for? All right, you're going to stay at my house today, okay? No, thank you. It'll just give me some peace of mind. -You're drunk. -Violet, I'm fine. Just stop being so stubborn. Honestly. That's funny coming from you. I'm just trying to help. Why don't you just worry about your own life? Because from the looks of it, you're the one who needs the help. Go to hell. I'll see you there. Do you want to know why I've hated you so much for the last six years? It's cause you did it. You got out. My big sister, living her dream in the big city. The person I looked up to most in this entire world. She did it. Well... ...it's not all it's cracked up to be, is it? You're destructive, Robin. [somber music] And I wish that I could help you, but I don't know how. And I'm not gonna let you drag me down with you. [Violet sighs] You could have left too. Excuse me? I said, you could have left too. No, I couldn't have, 'cause I don't leave behind the people that I care about. Not when they need me. Sorry, I wasn't really expecting anyone to show up. But...

I mean, do people even eat food at a wake? -Goddamn it, I can't get this button, honey. -Mom. Drinks, we have enough drinks? That would be a disaster. Mom. It's gonna be fine. Hey... I miss him too. [gentle instrumental music] [music continues] [muted voice] [music continues] [footsteps approaching] You know, you're actually a pretty decent public speaker. So at least you have that going for you. Thanks, sis. [knocking on door] Hey. [sighs] Hey. I'm sorry about the dig yesterday. [sniffs] I'm just, uh... -...I'm just really worried about you, you know? -[Robin] I know. -[sniffs] -[both sob] ["Wasting time" by The Royal Streets] So sappy, you guys. ♪ The skies are perfect And you're my... ♪ When are you guys going home? I don't know. I should probably get back to work. -Right. -Mm. So I guess I'll see you at Mom's funeral. -[Garret sighs] Too soon, Vi. -[Robin] Too soon. Seriously, though, when do I get to see you guys again? Just come down to the city. I have a couch with your name on it. It's got buttons. It does all kinds of cool stuff. [Robin laughs] -No, I can't. My life's here. -[Garret] Okay. Plus someone has to take care of our widowed mother. Uh, she'll be fine, -you know, she's a fighter. -[Robin] Mm-hmm. Besides, there are a lot of really cool, respectable strip clubs in town. You know, nothing contagious. You'll have a job in not time. Are you and Parker gonna tie the knot anytime soon? Mm. We've been talking about it more and more lately. [Violet] Ooh, speak of the devil and he will appear. -[Robin] Parker, come hang. -I am the devil. -[Violet] One, two, three. -[Robin laughs] -Oh, oh! -[Violet laughs] -So fast. -[Violet] No, he's not. I expected communion. Your mom's looking for you. We're heading to the house shortly. [all sigh] I feel like I ruined the vibe. -[laughs] -No, no, no. You guys okay? -Yeah. -No, no, no. I've just been drinking since 10:00 a.m. Well, I waited till 11:00 'cause I'm the classy one. -Sure. -Classy. -Mm-hmm. -Yeah. The classy one. ♪ Waiting my time ♪ ♪ With you ♪ [exclaims] Hey, girl, are you Robin? Come here. Oh. [exclaims] I'm sorry, what's your name? Oh, I live-work with your sister. It's me, Jenna. -[chuckles] Oh, stop! -Jenna, right. First of all, you look sexy as hell in that dress. So know that. And the second of all I'm really sorry about what happened to your dad. I know what you're going through. My kitty died last week. I mean, not the same thing, but if you need anything, you just let me know. That's very sweet of you. Thank you. No worries, I'm sure Vi would do the same for me. You know the saying, girls who strip together stick together. [chuckles] Actually, no, I, I haven't heard that one before. Do you know where Vi is? I'm pretty sure she stole a pair of my shoes and I want to go beat the shit out of her. -Hello. -Hey. Hi, Robin. -Awkward. -[both chuckle] I'm so sorry. I just need to steal her away -for just a minute. -Oh! [whispers] Okay, I get you. Sorry. I will see you later, handsome. Later, sister. Love you. [chuckles] [Jenna exclaims] -Wow. -[chuckles] What is with you and these mysterious women -that keep showing up? -I don't know. Is there's something you're not telling me? You didn't have to come. No, I wanted to. You did great up there. -Let's head inside. -Yeah. -Yeah. -Lead the way. Doing okay? Everyone keeps asking me that. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, you're lucky to have so many people that care about you. I'm gonna get a drink. Does anyone want an actual drink? -No? -I'm good. Hi, I'm Parker. -Hey. -You must be Hot Dylan. -Oh, yeah, okay. [chuckles] -I've heard about you. -Who calls him Hot Dylan? -Hi, Dylan. Uh, it's a name. -Can I talk to you for a minute? -Yeah, of course. I think there's something that you need to know. -What the hell are you doing here? -I'm sorry. -I, I-- I just-- -I told you not to come back. You're not welcome in this house. -You just need to understand. -No I don't. We have a restraining order against you. What's going on? -Robin, if you could go outside. -Please, Diane. -It's time to let her know. I-- -Robin, please. I know I screwed up. I know that. You screwed up? You killed a child. It was an accident. -Get out. -I made a mistake... -Get out! -...and I have to live with it for the rest of my life. Ellie, we tried to help you. You tried to help me? By locking me away in a hospital and playing house with my husband? -You-- -You took everything away -from me. -No, you threw them away. I just want my family back. -Okay, can we calm down. -Don't touch me. I think it's time you left, Ellie. -You never should've come back here. -[Ellie] This is my home. -No, this is my home. -[Ellie] This is mine. This is all mine. And you took everything -away. You took-- -You need help! I needed my husband. He didn't want you. -[groans] -That's it, that's it, Ellie that's enough. -She's my daughter! -Don't you just say that! She's my daughter. I just want to talk to her, I just want to talk to her. [sobbing] I just wanna fucking talk to her. Robin, Robin. Robin, I am so sorry you had to find out like that. Robin, please let me explain. Robin. Why didn't you tell me? We were trying to protect you. Protect me? From what? [sighs] Okay, so now you're just going to run off again like you did when your father was sick. When we needed you? Oh, God, I am so sick of people making me feel guilty. When did it become my responsibility to stay? Did you just expect me to put my life on hold? I expected you to be here for your father. Oh, the man who I just found out, lied to me. Oh, don't you dare judge. Not after coming back into this house after six goddamn years. I gave everything for you kids. So you could have a better life. Yeah, because my life's been just perfect. [sighs] You have no idea. You made your own decisions. Yeah, I did. And I chose you. She may have given birth to you, but I raised you. I am your mother. Don't forget that. [church bells ringing] Robin, I think you should head back into the house. [Robin] Just give us a minute, please? You must have a lot of questions. Kyle... ...was my brother? What happened to him? I had a few drinks just to... We were... You were begging to go see the boat. And I... I... You were just begging, so I... You were pretty stubborn. I put you two in the truck. It was a mistake. I was sick. I'm sorry. [somber music] [sobbing] I missed you every day. [crying] [dramatic music] [music continues] Everyone's always surprised when I say I hate speaking in front of people. Maybe because my dad didn't have that problem. He knew how to command a room. He made his presence known. Even when it wasn't always welcomed. I wish I had that confidence. When I was little, he used to tell me the story of David and Goliath. David, a young boy has to face off against Goliath, an unbeatable warrior. And against all odds, David wins. [music continues] Whenever I was struggling, he reminded me of that story. He taught me the importance of standing your ground, of facing the seemingly impossible. He taught me to never give up, even when it feels like there's no other option. And Dad, I'm so thankful for that. [dramatic music] Thank you all so much for coming today. It means the world to me and my family. And it would have meant the world to my father. [cellphone vibrating] [cellphone continues vibrating] [door opens] [door closes] [man] Can I steal one? [coughs loudly] Please tell me this isn't your first time. [coughs] Nah, I used to steal them off my brother all the time. You're parents around? No, just me. What, you live in this place? Kind of. Owner's letting me stay here for a few weeks, as long as I help out around the place. It's like slow season or something. So, why'd you leave? I don't know. I guess I was just sick of it. You ever get that feeling? All the time. My name's David. I'm Robin. Thanks for the cig. Hey, David? Go home, okay? [church bells ring] ["Killing Flowers, Pt. 2" by The Royal Streets] [gentle music]
