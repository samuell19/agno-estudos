Dear Doctor Hatano here. They found a male corpse in town. About 40 or 50 years old. A bottle of pesticide near the corpse. Decomposition has begun to set in... Thanks for the report. Listen, the local doctor just disappeared this evening. I don't think it's decomposing yet. I'm sorry, sir. Thanks anyway. Stay on the lookout. Doctor! Stop! Stop! Wait! Shige! Shige, what happened? Where'd you find this? I found it. Where? Did you see the doctor? Doctor! Where did you find it? Over there. Where's there? Please, stop that! It's pitch black here at night. I'd never make it here. Yeah? I kind of like it. It's not bad. Build a little house, grow a garden, make some pottery. It's city folks like you who upset the locals, moving here for fun. What? Not this case. Our guy is a doctor. He serves a noble cause. That only makes it worse. Being a doctor here, you're all alone, surrounded by old folks. Your job is to just sit around, watching them die. Anybody normal would get the hell out after 2 months here. What do you mean "get the hell out"? This is no suicide or accident. Did you hear how much the village paid him a year? What do you mean? Was it really low? Go ahead and guess. Well, he was a doctor. At least $70 or $80, 000... Maybe not, all the way out here. Double that, $200, 000. Investing in an education early in life sure pays off. I'll talk it over with my son at home. He hung in here over 3 years. I bet he saved up enough to open a hospital. Oh boy, the old folks are flipping out. He's probably getting drunk with a girl. Let's go home, Okayasu. Chief, that really is the doctor's coat. He found it by a field, 500 meters from here. He only found the doctor's coat there. In all my years here, this is a first. I don't know what to do. What? I don't know. I don't see any stores around here. Let me ask you, why'd you get so lucky? I was sure I'd get the better hospital. It's not too late to swap, you know. I'll go to your hospital. You have now reached your destination. What? Hold on. You OK? That was close. Are you OK? - What's going on? -You OK? Just not feel ing right. Since when? About the last 10 days. What are the symptoms? No appetite. Just can't eat. Just feels sluggish. Mornings, too? Can't eat a whole meal. Nights, too? Drinking lots of water? Not drinking so much. You're up on your feet. Oh, sorry. It's all right. I'm starting today, I'm from Tokyo, I mean Osaka, no, I'm Soma Keisuke, your new intern... I know, I know. Why don't you get a little more rest, Doctor. My name's Ino. Chappy! Looks like he's all better. Kamiwada Village Clinic Tell me if it hurts. That hurts. -That hurt? -It hurts. I'm amazed, Doctor. Why did you come all this way? Did you lose a bet? No, no, no. The countryside like this, it's just so remote. The air is so clean and I just think it's wonderful. I have my doubts about big city medicine. Everyone's all caught up in the rat race. They can only see the symptoms, not the person. Did you hear that? This doctor's very noble. Shall we have him move in? Sounds fine. But doctor... You like him better than me? No external wounds. You're not numb anywhere, right? You have a mild concussion. Something wrong? No... You worried? Well, yeah... Sure you are. Do you want a CAT scan? No, I'm fine, you've examined me. Let's do what's best for you. Anxiety is the worst poison. -You have a CAT scan here? -No we don't. There's a hospital nearby. I'll write a letter introducing you. Just drive on over there. Drive on over... How long a drive? Not quite two hours. One way? Dr. Ino! It's Grandpa Takahata! He's wheezing. Can he talk? No, he can't talk back. What will you do? Dr. Soma, show me your eyes. Get up. Get up. Jump. Again. You're totally fine. Wonderful! Shall we go? What? Your car still runs. The key's still in it. I don't have a license. Kozo, Kozo. Are you feeling bad? I'm going to check your chest. Sorry, give me your arm. When did it start? Just a while ago. We were eating and looked over and he was wheezing. He was looking so good today. He got out of bed and gobbled up all the sushi she brought. Dad! Intubation. Doctor. Thank you very much. He had a good life. He was sick for so long. But he looks... So peaceful in death. Harue. The phone number for the Tokiwa Shrine. Don't, Auntie! Why not? The sooner you get this over with the better. Remove it. Yes. Kozo, you held on a long time. Dad! He came back to life. What do you see? His tongue? A piece of sushi. What a lucky man. Welcome back, Kozo. A piece of sushi. Sushi, everyone. What an amazing doctor! Doctor, save me when I'm dying. Listen to my belly. Let's Banzai for the doctor! Welcome Dr. Soma to Kamiwada Village! Before he came here, our village was doctor-less. 4 whole years, get it? 1, 500 people live here, half of them old and no doctor! What were we supposed to do! We had to bring one here! We had to drag one here! And whose job was that? You, the mayor... Exactly right. It was all up to me. And then, him! And where did I find him? The health check-ups for your staff... Yes! He came riding on the mobile clinic like... A prince. I already told you? Over and over. -I did? -Yes. Officer, officer!. Officer, take this. Please find the doctor. Without him, this village... I've got diabetes, too. I understand, I do. But let's just wait overnight. Then, call the prefecture health services and tell them you need a doctor... In these hard times, nobody will pay any attention to us. You don't understand, Officer. The gods will punish me, but we need that doctor more than we need any god. That man is god! Doctor! I ran out of the pills that let me sleep at night! Can you make it through tonight? I'll bring you some tomorrow! Don't you worry! Dr. Soma, look. Oh, no, no. Hello! Hey, stop, stop. You know her, Doctor. She's Mrs. Torikai. Her house is just off that road over there. I see. Hey, what is this? You started it. Started what? He's a really great doctor. Otake, don't bother. Some elderly people don't come to the clinic. He visits them and gives them check-ups at home. He's diagnosed plenty of strange diseases that way. You could, too. But there's no pay. What? You volunteer? Don't say "volunteer". That woman we saw used to visit the old doctor. She's got gastritis, a bad stomach. After her husband died, there's no one to look after her. Her daughter's a doctor. If she's sick, she can ask her. But she goes to the pharmacy regularly for stomach pills. Who tells you that? Her doctor's prescribing them. Her daughter's a doctor in Tokyo. She wouldn't let her mother see a country doctor like me. I'm sure she tells her mother to just take her pills. It gets ugly when you doctors fight over turf. More like a treaty of non-aggression. Forget it. Please drive, Doctor. OK. It's not fair. You visit her neighbors. Neighbors? They live too far apart to call them that. Doctor... Today... Grandma Grandma Do you have an assistant? Grandma Oh, yes, Shigeko. This is Dr. Soma, who's helping me for the next 2 months. Nice to meet you, Shigeko! Let me examine your chest. What? Are you embarrassed? Because Dr. Soma's good looking? Oh, no, no. You believe her. No, I don't. -Quiet. - Sorry. Just checking below. Oh, good. Your chest sounds good. 168 over 78. Don't worry. You just got a little nervous. I'm taking a look at your eyes. What am I supposed to do about my eyes? If only I could see a little better with them. Say, who are you? Mother... He's Dr. Ino. Ouch! Dr. Soma, hold her legs down. I need a steady hand. Hold on, it won't hurt. The hell it won't! I gave you a shot two days ago, right? And it worked, right? Can I give you another one? Yeah, you can. Sing that song. Which one was it? She's not used to getting shots. The shot the doctor gave you two days ago worked, right? This one loves to eat. She wants to eat again right after she eats. The tests from your blood sample last week were fine. Your tests are fine. What? But your blood pressure is a little high. So please take an anti-hypertensive drug. What? Please take an anti-hypertensive! Hyper-Pensive? An anti-hypertensive drug to lower your blood pressure. He has auditory hallucinations. Really? When I stopped in on him before, he was talking to a raccoon. A raccoon? Watch the step! Here goes! Help!. Hey Doctor! Say, Doctor, can't I drink any tomato juice? Of course you can. I can't have apple juice or bread. I can't eat anything long, Iike sushi rolls or noodles. I'm no supposed to eat anything nutritious. I'm just supposed to think about dying. Their campaign is electronic. They have like a video, that they make me watch over and over and over again. They peer down from the ceiling and pierce all over my body with needles. It hurts so much... Hello, Seiten Pharmacy. I'm delivering your drugs. Even in bed, I'm tied down, so I can't roll over. And in the bed... There's a man. How disgusting... Yasue, are you taking your medicine? I can't take any medicine. They tell me to just think about dying. You bastard! I've had enough! Don't stop her from taking her drugs! Yasue! Eat whatever you want! If you like it, eat it! Eat bread or sushi or whatever! Doctor, can I drink black tea? Sure, drink black tea. But she was so happy. You saw her. She may enjoy it but it's no cure. It's loneliness she's got. It's totally real to her, but nobody takes her seriously. Just deliver her medicine. You're only making her worse. So that's your medical judgment? I've been meaning to tell you. Take care, we'll be back. Stop by the clinic and check our inventory. Of course. Doctor, I'm sorry about all that before. Did you go to the same medical school as Dr. Ino? It's not like that. You deliver drugs directly to patients? Terrible, right? I'm not some wholesaler. This doctor finds sick people and I have to give them pills. Look, it's Yasue. Yasue! Yasue! Dr. Soma! Wake up! Please wake up! Wake up! Hurry! Hisashi, drive carefully! No accidents! How long now? 7 minutes. Isn't it speeding up? It says "Labor in first time births lasts between 14 and 15 hours". What do you mean, "It says?" Didn't you just pass your doctor's exam? I've never seen the real thing! Neither have I! Not yet, not yet! Your uterus isn't dilated yet. Hold her legs together! It's coming out! Dr. Ino Osamu, who worked in Internal Medicine at your hospital from 1998 to 2000. He sure changed hospitals a lot. Nobody ordered him, right? I don't know... Is that right? Oh, hello. You're Chitose Sushi? This isn't Ino's residence? I guess not. Hey, wait, this is the police... Mayor, did you ever hear what kind of work his father does? Let's see... Yes, I think he's a banker. He works as a branch manager for a credit bank somewhere. Ino Osamu Don't ask me. I don't know either. Emergency Contact: Ino Kazuo He told me his dad ran a small factory. Where? Somewhere in Osaka. I think he made semiconductors but I'm not sure. It was in Kyoto. It was a woodworking shop. He told me when he saw the cedar tree on my place. No, that factory belonged to that schoolteacher. Dr. Ino's father was a priest. Good at chanting sutras. Nope. He's the captain of a pleasure boat. The doctor has a captain's license. It was a woodworking shop! Are you sure he's a captain? Yeah, he told me when I made a delivery. Wakatsuki Medical School 50th Anniversary - Dr. K. Ino I called out to her but at first I couldn't tell. She was crouched in her field, looking pale. The three of us rushed her here. I'm fine. I was just... A little hot. Did everything just suddenly turn black? Well, maybe. It was just for a moment. I'm sorry. May I look at your face? Mrs. Torikai, how is your stomach feeling these days? Thank you, I'm mostly better. May I listen to your chest? Please lie her down. What's with you guys? I ask about her chest and you get all worked up. Move over there. You know their blood pressure's way up. They're sicker than you are. Excuse me. I'll only apply a little pressure. If it hurts, tell him. Don't hold back. It doesn't hurt? No. Kazuko's lost so much weight. And she's so pale. Maybe she's really sick. She's fine. If she does get sick, her daughter can just get her a private room in a good hospital, again. Right. Here? No. OK, all done. In this heat, without proper nutrition and water, anybody would collapse. I'll leave you medicine to aid your digestion. Don't exert yourself. Thank you. Shall we go? I'm fine. Take care of yourself. You can go now, thank you. Let's go. Go on home, she's fine. She's fine. Is her stomach OK? Why? She's anemic, right? Oh, yeah? Didn't you leave iron pills, too? Can I see her chart? What are the diseases that can cause anemia? Name them. Cancers and ulcers of the digestive tract, Ieukemia, Iymphoma... And also, hemorrhoids. Ovarian myoma, pregnancy... Pregnancy? That would be a miracle. A miracle. You have to really examine her. I know, I know. Some 66 year-old woman in some country, gave birth, she did. I can't remember where. Maybe it was Romania... I know, it was Bulgaria. Bulgaria? Classic Comedy Routines Good evening! Sorry to bother you at night. I'm from the clinic. Please, Doctor. Oh, thanks. Thank you. Yes? Wakatsuki Medical School. You know it? Did your daughter also... My daughter flunked their entrance exam. It's not mine, it's my father's. My father's initial is "K" and my first name is Osamu. Don't blame me, blame my dad. Mrs. Torikai. Um... What shall we do about your stomach? There were so many people earlier... Are you consulting your daughter? Well, yes, yes. That's fine, then. I won't worry. What does she say? If I can be of help, I'd like to follow her instructions. I can call her directly. Let's do what's best for you. Excuse me a minute. Mrs. Torikai. It's delicious. Seconds? I'll help myself, thanks. I'm sorry to be such a pest. I'm really fine. This is the last dish. Doctor, do you mind? Can you julienne that? Julienne it? Slice it. Do the scores always stay up? Yes, they do. If he makes a Strike, it'll show up on top. Was that a Ball? That was a Ball. It says "2 Balls," right? It's more fun if you understand the score. You're right. If you know what's going on, it's more fun to watch. Go ahead, Doctor. I don't smoke. Oh, excuse me. Do you smoke? Oh, no. The previous doctor liked to. When my husband visited him, they smoked up a storm. Yeah, back in the old days, when my dad finished a surgery, he'd always light up. Doctor, you're a thoroughbred. It's a secret. Why? My young assistant... His dad is a doctor, too. Runs his own private hospital. So that explains his car. I'm always teasing him for being a rich man's spoiled son. It'll be our secret, then. Say, Doctor. Could you please not tell my daughter? Is... Yes. Is my body, is it fairly far gone, already? No, that's not what I'm saying. We don't know yet. You see, Doctor, I'd like you to do as little as possible. I don't want to do anything. But your daughter won't agree to that. After all, she's a doctor, she can do anything... I know, that's why I don't want her to know. What I'm asking you now, it's like I'm rejecting her whole life. But I don't want to go anywhere now, I'm tired. I'm a burden, right, Doctor? No... I'd be a burden to my children, too. They all finally got out of this village and attained the lives they wanted so desperately. I can't stand dragging them down. Can you at least consider it? Doctor, before, you said you'd do whatever's best for me, right? Yes, I did. In that case, Doctor, won't you help me tell my little lie? You're going to lie to your children to take the pressure off them? That's right. I don't want to... repeat what happened... with my husband. All right, I accept. But now that I've accepted, you need to let me examine you properly. Otherwise, I'll end up with a hole in my stomach, too. OK, I'll let you examine me properly. Listen... Don't sigh like that. You're seeing a doctor at Prefectural Internal for your ulcer, right? You're real tight with him, right? I want to ask him... Not anymore. Last month, I made a mistake and beat him at golf. What's that! You let a thing like that get between you? Hello, Seiten Pharmacy. Hel lo. What? Oh, my. When I stopped by, she wasn't feeling well. You stopped by? Yes. I'm having a little stomach trouble. Well, that's not good. I got a little worried. So I asked Saimon's help. Of course you did. Shall we examine it? Yes, please examine it. Can we look in your stomach with a camera? Sounds scary... But yes, you can. You're very brave. Shall I schedule it for tomorrow morning? Mrs. Torikai, how's your appetite? Well, I've really had no appetite at all today, so I only sipped some tea this morning. Why, that's terrible. Nothing to eat all day? But what a perfect coincidence. You mean, right now? It looks like rain. Why don't you go home? But Doctor, you have 2 more house calls. You're right. I have those patients, too. I can't make you handle those all by yourself. I'm sure you'd be worried to death. No, I'll be fine. You sure? They'll have all kinds of complaints. I can handle them. -You can? -I'll be fine. OK, go ahead, then. Yeah, yeah, there's nothing here. I've figured out all the families in the village... Oops, let me call you back. Hello! How's your knee? Thanks to you, it's getting better. It's going to pour, isn't it? Hurry, hurry up or we'll get wet! - You're right. - Hurry! I'm sorry to call out of the blue. Is this the home of Dr. Ino from Wakatsuki University Hospital? I'm Officer Hatano from the Hamaoka Police. Do you have a son by the name of Ino Osamu? The day before yesterday, the village mayor called to inform us that your son had left the clinic and hadn 't returned. Well, it seems there was some trouble between the doctor and a patient's family... The family seems to be disputing a diagnosis he made. No, no, they're disputing your son's diagnosis. What? Excuse me, your son... Dr. Ino Osamu is the doctor at the Kamiwada Village Clinic, isn 't he? Hello? Madam... What do you th i nk I found? You found cancer. Not quite. It's an u lcer. It's pretty advanced. Because you won't complain. Is that so? If the ulcer gets worse, you'll still have to operate. We can't operate on that here. I don't want that. Of course you don't. So you listen to what I say and take your medicine and get better. You're right. That's what I'll have to do... Doctor! I'm cutting open your shirt. You're going to be fine. His family will be here soon. Wait for them outside. All the ambulances are out. They had mud slides. Sure, we'll secure it and deliver him ourselves. I'm late. Does it hurt? It's swollen. It's not dislocated, it's broken. Doctor, prepare for an X-ray. Sakamoto, did you hurt your chest? Sakamoto, after we get an X-ray, we'll take you to a surgeon at the hospital. Otherwise, the bone won't set right. I'll ride with you. Thanks, Doc... Can you stand? Did you hurt your head? Doctor, his breathing! Not my head... Can you breathe? Saimon, get a tank from the recovery room! Oxygen! On your finger... Does it hurt? Did you break a rib? His oxygen saturation level is down to 89. Pulse is 1 15. Oxygen. Please. Here comes oxygen. How is it? Sakamoto. Sakamoto! Hold him! How about his chest? His left breast isn't rising. Oxygen? Flowing but saturation won't rise. Let's move him. He won't make it here. In this weather? It'll take too long. How about a helicopter? Call the Fire Department or the Self Defense Force. They have helis. You know he can't fly in this condition. Doctor, examine his chest again. His family? I'll tell his family. One more time. I can't hear his left chest breathe. Saimon, empty your car. Go! Doctor, I think it's pneumothorax. Please deaerate. If you release the air with punctures, he'll make it, right? I'm ready in here! Doctor, as you know, his lung is torn and air has leaked into his chest. You just need to puncture it, right? I worked the emergency room in a hospital. I can assist. But I can't puncture it myself! -What's this? -Dr. Soma, hold his head. - He has pneumothorax. - Tension pneumothorax. Hurry up. Wow, look at that jugular vein... 92, 93, it's rising. Here, please. Dr. Soma, he's inserting one more in the 3rd intercostal. Oh, yes. Sakamoto! He's releasing the air that got trapped in your chest. You'll feel better really soon! Couldn't... Breathe... Did it hurt? No, you never even felt that needle. No, you didn't. Dr. Soma, load him into Saimon's car and drive. Take it slow. Don't move his arms. This elevator is going down. The door is closing. Doctor! It's over. Doctor! Doctor! Let's go. Is he out? Let's go. Handing over emergency surgery patient, Sakamoto. Nice job. Oh, Dr. Ino, I'm Teshigawara. Good to meet you. There was no flail chest and the lung damage was limited. I just inserted a drain. I didn't see any other organ damage or external wounds. He'll be fine. How about the bone in his arm? His arm? That can wait. Tomorrow is fine for that. The real problem was right here. You made a brilliant judgment call. Without that puncture, he didn't have a chance. You laugh, but except for emergency room staff, most doctors haven't seen a case of tension pnuemothorax. Sure, they read about it, but when an actual case shows up, they panic and the patient's gone. How lucky you have such a great local doctor. Listen to him and learn as much as you can. Yes, thank you so much. Thank you so much. Doctor! Doctor, Grandpa Matsuki has a fever again. It's been over 40c for 2 hours. Let's go. Medical License- Ino Osamu It's the doctor's handwriting. Ms. Otake. Do you know any places Ino is likely to stop by? Likely to stop by? He probably has a friend or two somewhere, willing to take him in. After all, whatever the outcome, he's been providing a service, right? Well, I guess, it doesn't matter, as long as he's replaced. Ms. Otake. You worked with Ino for 3 and half years? Yes, that's right. Working in such a lonely place, there must have been things you shared with only each other... You mean, that? Excuse me, but no thanks to that. Why not? My ex-husband was a doctor. I hate to repeat myself but Ino was not a doctor. Oops, you're right. I'll be back next week, Doctor. Tuesday, then. Doctor, Monday's looking good for Kawamoto Steel's physicals. Hello. Hello. We're expecting Grandma Tashiro this afternoon. Thanks for the food. Fried food for lunch again. Pathology Report Torikai Kazuko The diagnoses of the biopsy tissue for stomach cancer are divided into 5 categories. Group One Normal tissue and non-variant, benign lesions Group Two Variant Lesions which are diagnosed benign Group Three Lesions on the borderline between benign and malignant Group Four Lesions strongly suspected of cancer Group Five Cancer Torikai Ritsuko My dad had it too. Did your father also have high blood pressure? Myocardial infarctions do run in families. Does it hurt where we intubated you? Hello, this is Tori... Oh, Ritsuko! I can 't take your call. Please leave your message. Hello, I'm here from the clinic. Hel lo. Nice to see you. Hel lo. I just trusted him, without knowing anything about him. When you think about it, it's so frightening. I've gotten so old... I don't know anything. Did your condition actually worsen after he started examining you? That's what so strange. There were times, that I'd improve, after he examined me. Ridiculous, right? You seem awfully discreet, or maybe you're very loyal. Once you've met someone, it's not so easy to bad mouth them. But if his diagnosis was right, he should have sent you here sooner... Hatano... Please think it over rationally. Did that man ever do anything for you? Nothing at all. Can you sleep at night? Yes. These days I listen to classical comedy routines. They make me sleepy. On the radio? No. I found the cassettes my husband used to collect. I'm taking this one out. They're cassette tapes? Yes. I hear people don't use them much anymore. Yeah. This is a cassette player? Yes. It belonged to my daughter, a long time ago. So it stops a lot. I wonder if I still have one. It's all right. I fall asleep just at the part that it stops. Tatsuo, please hold on, I'll put the doctor on. I'll put Dr. Ino on the phone, now. Doctor, Tatsuo's grandson has a stomach ache. Huh? Doctor. Huh? Hello. Which side of his stomach is hurting? That's right. No, that's OK. I'll head over there now. I'll head over now. All About Stomach Cancer You OK? Doctor, you'll get dirty. You OK? OK? I'm sorry, are you in pain? I'm so sorry, so sorry. Doctor, please help me. My daughter's coming. Please help me. Still, it hurts. "Quiet, quiet. "The hawk-nose doctor "is taking a nap at the top of the tree. " Torikai Kazuko When did you go to the hospital? About 2 weeks ago. Are you taking your medicine? Usually, I forget. Excellent. I'm not going to ask what you're going to use shots of my ulcer for, but... I know. How many? 1,400 left. By the end of the month. I can't buy that many. Think of the population here. I'm sure there's lots of old people you haven't even met yet. If you find 50 new patients, it'll just take 2 weeks. I'm going after everyone. The whole village has lower blood pressure. Really? Who knew that drug worked so well. All right! Let's settle on 500. Anymore is impossible. You're keeping alive folks whose time has come. It's not natural. But you can say that about the whole damn system. You and I would be both out of business. Enough, open your mouth. Your mouth. All right, I'll take 700. I just remembered, I ran into Sakagami at Central Hospital. You know Sakagami, of Toso Medica. He got transferred over here, still selling Pacemakers. It was just so great to see him, I almost mentioned your name... Toso Medica... Which Toso... Oh, the medical equipment... Yes, that one. I hear Ino used to be part of their sales team. For 10 years after he graduated from a regular old college, he sold their Pacemakers, you know, for hearts. He used to make sales visits to every damn hospital around. In other words, he used to be in your business. What a shock, right? After you've obeyed him like a dog. But working for that kind of company, you get to know a little about diseases and drugs... Oh, I get it. I know it sounds a little shady, but... In our line of work, we're grateful to every clinic that buys our drugs. We may know that our work can actually impact someone's life, but we don't dwell on it. But even in my position, when I'm directly interacting with patients. And even then only rarely, for an instant, I feel that I hold someone's life in my hands. I have to admit that it's a strange feeling. It feels inexplicably good and you want to feel it more. I know it's hopeless, but if I could become a doctor... You're saying that these old folks got used as toys for masturbating. But somehow he managed to hold the whole village's lives in his hands. Does it feel that good to be called Doctor? Or maybe he just did it for the money? No, I don't believe it was either of those... So you're telling me he did it for love? What's wrong? Tell me, Officer, was that love? Of course you don't love me, right? But still, your hand reached for me. So I believe... That's why he did it. Ino. Are you glad you got to be a doctor? Does she still do night duty? Yes, she still has to work hard. She's not getting any younger. How old is she? 35. Ritsuko is? But lucky her, dressing so young, showing off her bare arms. I wonder where she buys her clothes. Hey, Ritsuko. Cut it out. She's in a different league than us. She's done well for herself, buying her own apartment. Is that young guy still staying with her? I don't really know. I wonder what Dad would have said. He always let Ritsuko do whatever she wanted. Ironic she wasn't around when he died. That's enough. She introduced him to a hospital and that was it. She said she was too busy with her own work, just like a man. Sakiko... Say... Who are they? Are they from the clinic? -What? -What? Who's there? Where? There. They're gone. Dr. Hiraiwa? Dr. Hiraiwa died already. Really? How long ago? Did you wake up? You don't remember? It was a long time ago. It's so hot. Primperan, Takepron, Sucralfate, Ferromia. See you! Bye bye! Mother. They're gone. Tell me, are you seeing a doctor? Of course. You know how old I am. What for? Do you have stomach trouble? That's right. My stomach feels so heavy. When it's this hot, you hardly have an appetite. But those drugs are for treating ulcers. The doctor knows everything. What does that mean? Why didn't you tell me? Do my sisters know? I should have told them. They might have done the dishes. Tell me, are you being examined? I had to swallow a camera. I got a hole in my stomach because I'm worried sick about you. I'm expecting a delivery tomorrow. Can you remove the delivery notice? Thanks, I'll call again. Say Yu... Hello. Listen... What would you think about my mom, about living with her, would you consider that? No, I mean you. No, that's not what I mean. That's not... Doctor. Grandma Yoshii sent this over. Wow, it's so ripe. Bet it's tasty. Doctor. You see, I... Once I've finished my other internships, would you consider taking me back here in the spring? Why do you laugh like that? Tell your Dad? What'd he say? He's furious. Spending time here, I've started to wonder what I actually learned in medical school. In a big hospital, the doctors and the patients are like part of some huge bureaucracy. Even if I've stayed up all night working, patients just act resentful. But here, I feel like everyone appreciates my work, and everything just feels right. Well, patients don't really see that side of doctors... Of course, I know, but there's no question that the locals are grateful to you. Stop exaggerating. You look them in the eye, understand their situation and ask them what's best for them. You can't do that in a hospital. So even in this remote village, everyone feels secure because you're here. Hey... All right. I'll tell the mayor. What do you mean, "All right"? I'm really tired. Turn off the light when you're done. What is it? The people here just make do with less. They've always lived like that. It's got nothing to do with me. Actually, it's tougher than that. You have to work extra hard here. Without you, this place would've collapsed. They'll be fine without me. If I die, will they all die, too? -Don't be so extreme. -It's not extreme. You've really fallen in love with this place, haven't you? Not me. I'm not here because I love it here. I just wound up here and never left. I came here because the money is good and I figured it would be easy. But they keep throwing balls at me. So I hit their balls. I hit so they threw more. Over and over again. But, once I started hitting, I took it seriously and got hooked. Once I got hooked and kept hitting all their balls, I just forgot about everything else. But Doctor... Stop calling me Doctor. I really appreciate that you respect me, but Doctor, I'm a fake. A quack. Please stop that. Your modesty may please you but it makes us nervous. No, no, no, Doctor, I'm not qualified. Then tell me, just who is qualified? You don't get it. If you saw my father, you'd burst out laughing. He only thinks about managing the business. Frankly, he's not qualified to be a doctor. And I'm a complete fake. I can't believe people would put their life in my hands. Can't you just shut up? Are you really coming back in the spring? In that case, learn how to listen to your boss complain. You're just barking to hear the sound of your own voice. Eat the watermelon, turn off the lights and go home. Take the red pills 3 times a day. Here you go. Take care. I went to Nebuta, up north. Excuse me. Ueno Mitsue. Thank you for waiting. No change? Ume, you're next. Please wait. I'm back. The supra angle of the lesser curve of her stomach. The margins are clear and I diagnosed it as an ulcer. There's some evidence of healing here, as well as some bleeding, but the ulcer base is lower than the surrounding area and the depression is smooth. Yes, yes... Oh, I'm sorry. The biopsy results are benign. They were taken on July 22nd, 2008. About 1 month ago. Do you think this area is showing signs of healing? Yes it is. Had she already started taking medication by this time? From about 1 week before this exam. The idea of swallowing that camera can be a little... So she's in her 5th week. Sucralfate and an H2Blocker. No, a PPI, Takepron. Oh, Takepron. Doctor, please. It doesn't seem like her appetite's improving. She seems to have lost so much weight, I was shocked. It seems like you're giving her the right medication, but if she's not in remission after 5 weeks of care. She's got persistent nausea. Probably predisposed. Yes, the nausea, too. You're prescribing Ferromia. I never knew my mother was anemic. Do you think it's from the ulcer? According to these, she doesn't seem to be bleeding that much. The anemia concerns me. I hope it really is just an ulcer. She hasn't told you? What? Then your mother probably wants to keep it a secret. So please don't tell her. What is it? On the flip side. Right there. There was a time when there was some bleeding. Around her buttocks... I never heard this. That's why I don't want you to tell her. Your mother's embarrassed. It all makes sense now. I truly apologize for my rude questions. Not at all. When my father collapsed, I couldn't help diagnose his condition. I don't want to make that mistake again. I'm sorry. I only get to look after other people's parents. Well, of course... Doctor, how are your parents? I've brought them much unhappiness. Doctor, I leave her in your hands. Please take care of her. I'm sure she'll complain a lot. When are you leaving? I'm ready to leave now. When are you coming home? I wonder when... Hopefully about this time of year again. You mean, 1 year from now? Yes, once a year is all I can manage. But, you... One year from now... Is everything OK? Doctor... Please, sit down for a minute. I'll be right back. PIease leave a message. Pathology Report Torikai Kazuko The phone you have dialed is either out of range or is shut off and cannot be reached. It's terrible, he just abandoned me. He drew blood from me to run tests. 3 via ls, this size. He was treating me a long time and I took my medicine, but my knees are bad and my liver hasn't gotten any better. Are they arresting the doctor? He's going to prison? Using our taxes so he can live it up in jail? I told you, I never checked his license with anyone. It was my fault. Is that good enough? And you, Officer, are you real? Your police badge alone doesn't mean anything. So, you did have some doubts? I'm not sure they were doubts, but I did think he got away with his approach because this village is so remote. Were there any dangerous treatments or physical abnormalities? No. I always did my best to stay on the lookout. So you were always checking up on Ino? I don't want you thinking I was part of his scheme. Did you share your doubts with anyone? I didn't feel I could share them. I also didn't feel it was my duty to judge a system that seemed to be working fine for this village. You were awfully detached. What was the nature of your relationship with him? Even though you were suspicious, you acted normal, right? What did you talk about, outside of work? About personal matters, or whatever was on his mind? He wasn't... The type to talk about himself. Doctor. How would the villagers react if Ino came back? Would they go back to relying on their fake? I have a feeling we'd be the ones to get beat up and buried in the mountains somewhere. I don't get it and I don't like it. But I can't deny, that in his own fake way, he held this village together. And you know better than anyone else, how much that took. Wasn't he worried or upset about anything? Something that he only told you? You were his only subordinate. Or did you just... Never give him a chance to open up to you? He said he was a fake. He said that? What did you say? I didn't ask him about it. How did he wind up telling you that? How could I... I mean, I don't know. Why not? You already had your doubts, right? Why didn't you challenge him? Nobody actually listened to him. You guys were the ones that set him up to be the real thing. Doctor, let's go home. He's not here anymore. Hello, the Ino family. It's me, Osamu. My, how unusual. Is Dad awake? Yes, he's awake. I'd like to talk to him. He won 't even know who you are. I know that. Hel lo, it's me, Osamu. Can you hear me? Yes, yes. It's me, Osamu. Oh, I see. Dad. Your penlight... I lost it. Oh, I see. Your penlight... I'm the one that stole it. Oh, I see. Mom, why don't you get examined at my hospital? There's no one left here to give you medicine if your stomach hurts. I'd feel better if you were in my hospital's care, too. You're going to examine me? How scary. I'm not going to be your doctor. C'mon, Mom. That doctor said you have hemorrhoids... At our hospital we can rush tests through and all the doctors... Why should I go all the way to Tokyo when I feel just fine? The potatoes are just starting to grow in. If I don't water them everyday, they wilt right away. Yoshida and Hayashi, and... Auntie Kakei and everyone, are all looking forward to them. But... Maybe I'll try going. Yeah. Her ghost was playing your favorite song. Ohisa, please forgive me. I didn 't know any of that. Thank you for caring so deeply for me. For the rest of my life, I will... So eventual ly, you plan to talk to your mother about her illness? I fully intend to, but it's not so easy... It's strange, it is my profession. How has she been feeling? In the worst case, you could consider suing the village. Please hold off on that. I want to do everything I can for her. Yes, of course. It's all I can do for her. Besides, aren't I the one that should be sued? That's not true. You saved your hometown. Sometimes, I wonder. If I hadn't gone home, what he would have done. How that doctor would have cared for my mother through her death. Yes, I'm on my way. If you ever catch him, please ask him for me. I promise I will. Get better. Get better. Get better. Thank you. The smoking section is over there, please smoke there. Welcome, that will be 120 yen. Thank you. Welcome. You should get married. Yes, I don't even have a girlfriend. I think you should have a girlfriend. - You're right. -At least one. Take it with you, hurry. His hat and his teacher's book. She told you to pack it! Yotaro! Your teacher's book! Have Matsuo's vitals stabilized? Her blood pressure's low and she's not passing urine. Shall we up her Catecholamine? Yes we should. Doctor, please go ahead. Hey there. Hello.
