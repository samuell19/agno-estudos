[gasping] [woman] Stop. [heavy breathing] You are... hurting us. Burn in hell. [ashes scattering] [gasping] [speaking Hebrew] [building creaking] [speaking Hebrew] [speaking Hebrew] [demonic noises] No... [silence] [child giggling] [angelic music] What are you doing Yosille? You know what happens when I don't feed. This isn't real. [demonic whispers] [ashes shifting under foot] [little girl] Don't you want to see your wife again? No more. [Yosille] I will never feed you again. Very well. [little girl] Stay in your circle, Yosille. There are always others. Wait. You promise? [demonic noises] [little girl] A life... [demonic voice] for your wife. [giggling] [footsteps] I'm coming Aida. Forgive me God. [Yosille screaming] [demonic noises] [demon roaring] [demon roaring ends] [scolding] [demon roaring] [demonic screaming] [squelching] [somber music] [eerie sounds] [street chatter] [car horn] [children playing] Hey... Means a lot that you came. Claire, you can say it. What? [in Yiddish accent] "Art may love you, but you , you will never be family." He said that. Yeah he said a lot of crazy shit. This time will be different. [Art] He's loosened the Yarmulke . Trust me, he's changed. [Claire] I hope so. Just don't forget, you're carrying his only grandkid. It'd be a bad idea to piss you off. Hmm, that's right. Just give the old man a chance. I'm here, aren't I? Yes you are. [kiss] Alright. [sigh] [car door opening] [car door closing] [sigh] [street chatter] [piano music plays] [Art] Welcome home, Art. [door closing] [car boot closing] [piano music continues] [street chatter] [door opening] [man] All the holy books and scriptures does not always prepares us for tragedies such as this. Chazal teaches us, that in the beginning God spoke. and with these holy letters created the Universe. From the blade of grass to the burning stars that shine above us, all made of his holy letters spoken at the beginning of time. A man of heavenly perspective restores the letters of creation. [Rabbi] But in times of tragedy who can say that... How did you grow up like this? It was a laugh a minute. [shushes] Ah, I'm so sorry [Claire] I didn't mean to um... [door shutting] Great start. Yeah, very good. [male voice] Don't take it to heart. Death can bring out the worst in people. [footsteps] [man] Welcome home, son. It's good to see you dad. God, did I miss you. And you-- the famous Claire. Britain's finest. [scoffs] It's fine. Oh! We're family, right? So, um... Come and see your room. [piano music] [cutlery clinking] [Claire] Mmm! Oh my God. [Dad] Good, no? [Claire] Good? This is delicious! Did you make this? I've never had a dumpling that's-- No, no, no not dumpling. - Kreplach. - Ah,kreplach. That's very good! So, um, tell me. Boy? Girl? Ah, it's a girl. Ah! Perhaps she can learn to write like her mother. You read my articles? I did a little digging. Oh, it's just light editorial work. She's being modest. Claire's a great writer. On her way to writing a cookbook for the ages. [giggle] And she likes my kreplach ? Y'know Food connects the body to the soul so they say. [phone buzzing] [Claire] That's lovely. Hmm? Uh hmm. I'm just gonna uh... Excuse me. [footsteps] I should've gone to your wedding. When you see the world a certain way, it's not easy to accept change. I'm sorry. -It's alright. -No. No, it's not. Well, We're here now. Yeah. Did you show them the contract? [male voice]What contract? Until your Dad signs his house cannot be used as collateral. Just, uh-- tell them his lawyer's looking over the finer details as we speak. We're closing soon. [male voice]Soon is not gonna cut it. I know Claire's invitro nearly wiped you out but the bank doesn't give a shit. How long have I got? [male voice]Without your dad's house on the line, you've got no leverage. At this point, Art, if you don't get his signature by the end of the week, rest assured, the bank will take your home. Oh, and this, this is our backyard. No. You would be amazed at the size of the lemons we grow. That's beautiful. That's just beautiful. You know, my father, alav ha-shalom, always used to say, "the home, is the heart." Open home, open heart. You're gonna have a very lucky kid. [sighs] [eerie music] [Dad] I should probably move that. What happened to her? [puffs] What can I say, her name was Sarah Scheindal. We prayed, we hoped, we... searched. And eventually we found her. Yeah, it was terrible. Just terrible. You don't need to know. That's enough of all this. Sorry, I was just um-- Well your wife has just been showing me pictures. Such a home. My son, the real estate machor . [laughing] To new beginnings, hmm? L'chaim. - L'chaim. -L'chaim. To life. To life. [buzzer sounding] Oh! That must be Heimish. No rest for the wicked! [buzzer sounding repeatedly] [Heimish] Did the schmuck arrive? It's open! It's open! Even the dead are impatient. [hangs up phone] [Dad] Now... You wanna do a mitzvah ? [elevator door opens] [footsteps] [switch clicks] [doors creak open] [doors swinging shut] [doors bump] [wheels squeaking] [Heimish] Well look who it is, huh? The prodigal son returns. How you doin', boychik ? Good to see you, Heimish. I heard you piped a shiksa . Don't worry, we'll convert her. Heimish. Behave. [doors opening] [bag thumps] So, Reb'' Arthur, what brings you to Brooklyn? You miss my kugel ? Call my wife a shiksa again, I'll cock you in the mouth. What? You come to make peace before the baby's born? That's very wise. [Heimish] Look at you, the great business machor helping us with the grunt work. Such humility, Arthur. [water running] You're an idiot. You smell that? It smells like chazer . [water stops running] You got a problem with my diet? I wasn't talking about your diet, boychik . -[door opens] -[Dad] Something wrong? Nothing at all. Right Arthur? [Art] Nothing. Just like old times. [body bag unzipping] Oi... What happened? Nebach . Sruli ruled it a suicide. You knew him? Yosille Fishbein. Brilliant scholar. [Dad] After his wife died, became a recluse. Last I heard, he got lost in the esoteric. Desperate to contact the wife on the other side. It was only a few months ago, that we did the funeral for her. He tried everything to save her life. What's a man without his wife? [Dad] A good man. [speaking Hebrew] [Dad] Such is life. What a riddle. [book opening] [speaking Hebrew] Amen. Amen. Sarah Scheindal's ferry is confirmed we're all good on tomorrow. Good. You keep that on your head. Some things never change. [door opening] Saul, can I have a quick word? [agreeable grunt] Go ahead. I''ll get it started. [Heimish] Don''t forget tachrisim . [Saul] Ah, he knows, he knows. Ah, he's going to mess it up. He's not going to mess it up. Don't mess it up. [doors creaking shut] [rubber gloves crackling] [eerie music] [body bag unzipping] Oh my God. [eerie music intensifies] [metal bucket thumps] [tap water running] [straining] [metal thump] [grunts] [footsteps] [knife drops] [eerie music intensifies] [water dripping] [background traffic] You really don't find it suspicious that he shows up after all this time? You should've heard him on the phone. He really wants to start again. It took a lot of growth to come here. I know he's your son. But all is not butter that comes from the cow. You don't have the heart of a young man no more. Don't you love him? [groaning] Yeah, of course I love him. But I don't trust him. [fabric ripping] [eerie music] [eerie music continues] [demonic whisper] [water dripping] [grunting] [loud sound] [amulet shattering] [lights switching off] [lights buzzing] [Saul] Arthur, you alright? Yeah, everything's good. [Saul] You mess it up? I swear the farkakte wiring has a mind of its own. [door opening] [foot shuffling] [amulet dropping] You okay? Uh hmm. Still scared of the dark? Boo! Very funny-- [Yosille gasps loudly] Just a little rigor mortis. The body's last hurrah. Yeah, I'm starting to remember. [water tap turning] [eerie music playing] Why don't you check on Claire? Hmm? What? Did I do something wrong? No, no, no, no, no. I'll finish up here. We can do the rest tomorrow. Go. Go and get some rest. Dad, can I ask you a question? Of course. [somber music playing] I... Don't matter. Another time. [Saul] Heimish takes good care of me. You know? Try to get along. [Saul] Oh and Art... I'm glad you're back. M-me too. [doors sliding open] [revolving doors closing] [water dripping] [metal clanking] [water dripping] [ominous music playing] [music intensifies] [metal clanking] [ominous music] [Saul] Yosille, Yosille...

But we must ask, [phone ringing] [male voice]is this a God to believe in? a God who plays cruel mind games with his loyal servants? Our Holy Zohar explains what most don't-- [tape paused] [phone ringing] Shalom's warehouse. Hello, Reb Chayim? I-it's Saul. -[Chayim] Saul? -Yes, I need a favor. Sure. [Saul]I may have found something. Ayin, koof, dales. [Chayim] This is on the knife? Yeah, this is on the knife. Koof, dales, [Saul] and saf. It's an ancient warding inscription. What, you know of this? It's a... one of God's hidden names written backwords. [Chayim]It's for invoking sheidim, and for sealing them. Sealing them? Yeah, often in a body, but uh... honestly Saul, I, I wouldn't pay it too much attention. It's an old buba maisa. [Chayim] I mean, today's world, [Chayim] who has the know-how to seal a demon in a body? And what if someone did? Alright, look. Was there a pendant? [Saul] What ? On the body. Was there a pendant, an amulet of some sort, preserving a holy letter? -No, no. -You sure? Yes of course, just, just the blade. So what's the drama? No pendant, no seal. Which means, there is no way you picked up a body containing a demon. [Chayim] But say you did. [Chayim]the worst an entity like this can do, is mess with your mind. It's powerless whilst it's in a body. But honestly Saul, [Chayim]unless you're in the business of burning bodies... I wouldn't worry about it. Worse things have happened to the Jews, Saul. [Chayim] OK? Have a good Shabbos . Have a good Shabbos . [Chayim] Alright, bye. [receptor down] [tapping on the receptor] [knock] Ah! Look who it is! What are you up to? Oh, just a little morning read. You haven't seen Art? Woke up early, offered to help. Really? Yeah, I don't know what you've done with him. [Saul] Who knew? Hungry? Starving. [hearse door opening] [coffin sliding out] God. [speaking Hebrew] Sarah Scheindal. [man] I hope they find this sick meshugenah. [sliding noise] [wind chimes] [ominous music playing] [walls creaking] [music continues] [wind chimes] [music intensifies] [sigh] Oh, come on Saul. You're driving yourself crazy. [ominous music continues] [sliding noise] [door closing] [demonic noises] [camera clicks] [camera clicks] [camera noise] [loud noise] [gasp] [eerie music playing] Hello? [clock ticking] [eerie music continues] [clock ticking] [camera clicks] [sigh] [eerie music continues] [indistinct whispers] [camera static] [camera static] [indistinct whispers] [loud screaming] [camera smashing] [ghostly whispers] [Heimish singing in Hebrew]. [phone buzzing] [phone buzzing] [phone buzzing] [phone buzzing] [Heimish humming] [phone buzzing] [phone buzzing] [phone buzzing] Yes? [Jake]Art, it's Jake Bennett. How are we holding? Art's busy right now, can I take a message? I'm his assistant. [sigh] [Jake]Look, just let him know that we met his terms, but the bank was clear. He won't be getting a loan unless we have his father's place as collateral. We need him to sign the contracttonight or this deal goes away. I'll be sure to tell him. [exhales] [lip smacking] [Saul singing in Hebrew] [continues singing in Hebrew] [singing in Hebrew] [continues singing in Hebrew] Oh! Claire? [Saul] Look at you. [Saul] Every Friday night, the men sing to their wives and... and tell them that beauty is just a passing breath. But their kindness, their humanity, that is what every soul truly desires. We're a very misunderstood people. It's the burden of investing so much in internal meaning, it's... it's hard for outsiders to see. Y'know... comforting others didn't really, [clears throat] prepare me for my own grief. I... I should have... spoken to Art more, maybe shouted less, I don't know. [inhales] Sometimes, reflection comes too late. Hmm? Are you alright? Can I ask you something, Saul? Yeah, of course. Anything. Er... Do souls ever call out to you for, for help? The dead are just like the living, Claire. They still need love. [door slamming open] [Heimish] You know what your son is up to Saul? [Art] Heimish! He things you're a piece of toast to butter up. Go ahead, tell him! -Tell him! -Tell me what? All this, it's a game Saul! It's a game. He's a ganav . -What did you-- -A thief. That is not-- They're selling this whole place from under you-- What? What you talking about-- They didn't come here to reconcile Saul. They came here to use you! That is not, that is not true. Dad-- He's committed your property to some goyishe land developer-- That is not true! I'm sorry but th-that is outrageous. That is not the case, ok Dad? -Yes it is! -I can explain-- [Saul shouting] [paper rustling] [scoffs] You knew about this? -What was that? -It doesn't matter. -Can you just-- -We're leaving. Can you just talk to me? Claire, can we do this later? No, we can't! [Claire closing suitcase shut] Everything's gonna be fine, okay? Art, I want the truth. I haven't been able to sell a house in two years. [scoff] It's okay, I talked to the bank, refinanced the house-- You refinanced the house? You told me that you had everything under control. I-I left my job. I didn't have to do that. You told me, that everything was okay. And then here I am, choosing colours for the baby's room and picking furniture when we're on the verge -- We're not on the verge-- You know, you were lying to me for two years. We're supposed to be a family. We're having a baby. What was your plan, Art? Huh? I mean, what were you thinking? Did you see his face downstairs? [Art] Let me tell you about downstairs. That God, love and holiness. That's a lie. I watched my mother rot in that room, and when I needed him, you know what he told me to do? He told me to go away to synagogue and pray. So I prayed. I prayed and I prayed, "God don't take her. God have mercy. God don't hurt her!" I cried so much to God, there were no more words left on the page. [weeping] [Claire] You need to go down there and talk to him and make this right. If we leave now, you'll always regret it. [sniffing] I didn't come here to butter him up [Art] Okay? I- I wasn't going to sell the house from under him. [sniffing] I just needed to find the right moment to ask him face to face. I didn't want to hurt anyone. [Arthur] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

It's not like you're asking us to lug a sofa out of the garage. [man] What is this? Where's Heimish? Look, you still got the admission pages. Body was due to ship out two days ago. [man] It's a suicide! We need a police report. What? You know, where's Heimish? He doesn't work here anymore. [man] You still have the telephone? Let's just say I deleted his number. [man] Well, look... Unless you can transfer custody to a next of kin. [man] You're going to have to wait for police clearance. A next of kin? Arthur, if I were you, put your broigus aside. [man] Just call Heimish. [speaking Hebrew] Yeah, you too. [thump] [bag rustling] [car engine] [car door shuts] [street chatter] [road works] [door unlocking] [door creaking] [silence] Hello?

In your basement, you have someone very dear to me. [Claire] I am sorry. Who are you? Aida Fishbein. And you, you're the one who has my husband. [tape recorder whirring] My name is Yosille Fishbein, and I have finally found the cure for death. Last night after months of research by fire and ink, I finally conjured Martiel. [Yosille] The archangel of life. [static buzzing] Here is the interface between Heaven and Earth. Today, we bring back my beloved Aida from Heaven. [eerie music] [demonic noises] [Yosille] Do you hear that? The Archangel wants us to begin. Your prayers can bring back my beloved Aida. Go ahead Sarah.

[Claire gasping in pain] [shallow breathing] Why Yosille? [Aida] He should have listened. What have you done to me? Not me, your dream. [Aida] You've been infected. [groaning in pain] Soon, your child will join countless others. The many lost souls, calling out for help. Only you can stop this curse. Before it's too late. [gasping] The pendant?

[demonic sounds] [Yosille] What are you? [television static] This, this thing... it's in the house? I think so. It has my wife. [heavy breathing] What do I do? I know a Kabbalist . [knocking on the door] [door opening] [Chayim] Heimish. [eerie music] Arthur. [door closing] [violin music] What is that thing? A sigil. [ominous music] An altar, a sacrificial altar to those who enter it. Did you feed it? What? Did your wife go in this sigil? Uh... [haunting music] I don't know. Where is Yosille's body? [lights flickering on] [haunting music] It's been freed. It's vessel's been shattered. What is this thing? Bringer of miscarriages. Taker of children. [light bulbs exploding] [hurried footsteps] I must finish, what Yosille started! Where's the rest of it? -I-- -Where's the rest of it? Since before the era of concealment, Abyzou has been inflicting misery and miscarriage forcing the bereaved and the desperate to feed it. Until God intervened, and called upon Abraham to... sacrifice his son. [Chayim] Forever binding Abyzou. Until Yosille brought it back. It'll make you see things. Feel things that aren't real. Whatever it takes to get what it wants. A child inside that sigil. [ashes scattering] But with this pendant, we can bind it, and our prayers will force it inside. Only we determine how much good, and evil enter our realm. So how do I kill it? [footsteps] There is no kill. [haunting music] You trap it. How? [haunting music intensifies] Like Yosille did. [violin music] And this would save my wife? And my baby? [violin music] [violin music continues] [Chayim] We have no time. [Heimish] Chayim, there must be something else we can do. There must be another way. There's no other way. You must complete the entirety of the binding ritual. Once I finish the ash circle, do not stop. [doors swinging open] [windows shattering] Stay in the circle!
