- Have you seen him this morning? You're sure he didn't come back? - Easy now. That a girl, come on. You can make it. Keep trying. There you are. What are you doing in here? - Well, I didn't know if you was in or out. I never hear when you come or go. - Maybe I should wear a bell. Now get out. - Look, I ain't cleaned in here in a week. And I like things to be nice and neat. It won't take me a minute to get you fixed up. Gee, that cat's sure lucky, having you to take care of it. Now me, I never thought it'd live, busted leg like that. That's usually sure death for a cat. Any animal. - When I said get out, I meant now. Right now. - Well all right, all right. You needn't get in no huff. I just wanted you to be comfortable. I won't be back no more today. I am going shopping. - You don't wanna steal my money, Mrs. Duprez. - Oh, now wait a minute. - Now that is dishonest. Put it back, Mrs. Duprez. - Look, I didn't-- - Put it back! - Well all right, there. Now let me go, you're hurt-- - Don't you come back again unless I say so, you understand? Or next time I won't be so forgiving, Mrs. Duprez. - And maybe next time I'll tell them two guys you are here. - What guys? - The ones outside waiting for you. - Western Union, please. Yes, I'd like to send a telegram to Mrs. Sarah Walters. 8230 Race Street, Meadow Town, California. Here's the message. Lonesome for you, mom. Get out the fatted calf. Coming home in three days to stay a while. Love to Helen and Doug. That's right. You can sign it, your ever loving son, Johnny. Yes. How much is that? - Hi, Mrs. Walters. - Is that for me? - Your mother-in-law. What's the matter? You look worried. - Telegrams still make me nervous. - Nothing bad in this one. - Oh wait, I have some change inside. - Well I'm going to night school come September, Mrs. Walters. Just don't flunk me. - Helen, who was at the door? - Mother, I have some wonderful news, but I don't want you to get too excited. - What is it? - Johnny's coming home. - Johnny? Your brother-in-law Johnny? He'll be here in three days. I've heard he's very handsome. - It doesn't seem possible after six years, he's coming home. Is he coming alone? - I guess so, Lin. - He doesn't say how long he's going to stay. - Well, let's make him so comfortable he'll never wanna leave. - Oh my goodness. I must get the windows washed, and my hair, I just have to get it done. - Mother, calm down. - You're not supposed to get excited. - But I can't let him see me looking like this. He was always so proud of me. - You have plenty of time, three days. - You don't have to rush. - There's so much to do. His room, the blanket should be cleaned. I just don't know where to start. - You can start by relaxing, and I'll take care of the rest. - I'll help too. I'll make appointments at the beauty parlor for both of us. - If only Larry were alive. - Mother. - Oh, I'm sorry, dear. I'm sorry. But Larry loved Johnny so. - Mom. It was 34 to eight. - What was 34 to eight? - The baseball game. - Oh. - Oh? We barely won. - Doug. We have a surprise for you. Your Uncle Johnny's coming home. - He is? Well, it's about time. - Now what do you mean by that? - I'm tired of being the only man in the house. It was giving me a complex. - Complex. Yes. - Wow, what a belt. - There should be a law against cooking in the summer. I'm baked. - I wish you'd let me help. - It's all done, darling. Where's Doug? - Upstairs. He picked a bunch of flowers for Johnny's room. Wasn't that sweet? - Yes, I just hope they're from our garden. Mother, he'll be here. - I hope he's not sick again. - Will you stop worrying? Come on now, sit down. Lin Kirby called again. Now she thinks she ought to give Johnny a party. - Why? She doesn't even know him. - He's a man, isn't he? What more does Lin have to know? Oh, we should clean up for visitors more often. I found more things I misplaced. Mother, come on now. Can't you wait for Johnny sitting down? - Force of habit, I guess. When he was a boy and got into mischief, I always used to wait out here to warn him that his, his father was angry. What are you doing? - It's getting cooler out here. Maybe you want to wait inside. - I'm all right really. But you are shaking. I think you're more nervous than I am. - It's only the rush. - Mom. I made a bet with myself about 10 miles back. I knew you'd be waiting on the porch. - Johnny! - Oh Mom. - Oh darling! I'm almost afraid to believe it. - Why, Mom? - It's been so long, years without any word. And now you are here. I find it so hard to believe. - I should have written, I know. But when you've been traveling as much as I have... Well, let me look at you. Well, you haven't changed, Mom. - Oh, and how about you, Johnny? How have you been feeling? - Oh, I'm fine, just fine. - The headaches, you still get them? - No no, not at all. - You sure, you look tired. - Sure, I'm sure. I just told you, didn't I? Now you've got to stop worrying about me. I'm home and this is a celebration. Hey, where's my favorite sister-in-law? Helen? Helen? - Oh Johnny! - Helen. - It's so good to see you. - Well, you look more beautiful than ever. Maybe I should have come home sooner. - Oh the fatted calf. It's turkey that needs basting. Doug, say hello to your Uncle Johnny. - Hi, Doug. - Hi. - Go ahead, Doug, kiss your uncle. - Oh you're too big for that, huh? Shake. You know, you look an awful lot like your dad did. He and I were pretty close. Much closer than most brothers. You know, he was almost killed once trying to save me. I was on a bike and-- - Johnny. - Well anyway, he used to watch over me when I was your age. - I'm seven and a half. - You are, eh? Well you won't remember it, but the last time I saw you you weren't even two years old. - Oh I remember you very well. I spilled a glass of orange juice on your lap. - What a big guy! Say, do you suppose that you've got enough muscle to bring in some luggage? - Sure, what? - Those packages out there in the backseat. - Do you like baseball, Uncle Johnny? I sure do. - Boy, wait til I tell them, wow! - Wait, tell who what? - Well, our team has a big game tomorrow. Only Shorty Stevens has the measles. So I told the guys I'd ask you. - To do what? - Play outfield, of course. Whoopee! - He's quite a boy, isn't he? - Yeah. But he still hasn't gotten over Larry yet. Not completely. It was so sudden. - What about Helen? How's she? - Well, since she started teaching, she's better. But it's Doug we still worry about. A boy needs a father. - While I'm here, Mom, I'll spend as much time with him as possible. - Johnny, you can't imagine what your coming home means to all of us. I wish you'd never leave. - Merry Christmas. Well, it sure feels like it anyway. - Oh my goodness. Whoops! - Johnny, couldn't you stay? - I hope so, Mom. I feel so safe here. - I still don't think you should be doing this. - Why not? - Kitchen's no place for a man. - Lady, some of the places I've been in make a kitchen look like heaven. Besides, I've got to work off that dinner. Did you see all I ate? - Did you really like it? - Like it? I haven't, I've haven't eaten so much since Paris. - Oh, you've been to a lot of places, haven't you, Johnny? - You name it, I've been there. - Doing what? We never did now. - Oh, a lot of things. A lot of things I don't think I'll ever have to do again. - What do you mean? - Well, let's just say I got what I set out to get. - What was that? - What I wasn't supposed to have, I guess. Oh, that goes back to pop. Pop had a strict rule when we were growing up. Be content with what you have. We never had anything. And I wasn't very content. I didn't like being put out on a paper route when I was 12. I kept rebelling, which is why Mom and Larry always had to protect me. Bless them, they really did for years. Pop, he, he never learned how wrong he was. He stuck to the rules right to the bitter end. He died contented. We didn't even have enough to bury him with. - Are you content now? -Hmm? I hope so, Helen. First time in my life I really hope so. - Johnny, Helen, why not leave the rest for me? Well come inside. Doug's waiting for you. - We'll be done in a minute. Now out. - Oh but Johnny-- - Out, no buts, go on, go on. She can't slow down ever, can't she? What does the doc really say about her heart? - Oh, she'll be all right. As long as she doesn't worry or do too much. - That dress making sign out there. She's working again, isn't she? - Only once in a while for friends to keep busy, that's all. - She'll never have to do anything anymore. Not even for friends. I'll see to that. - Best thing Johnny, would be for you to stay. I mean, you're not married, you're alone. And well, we do worry about you. - We? - Well, you are all the family we have now, the three of us. I've never seen Mother or Doug look as happy as they did when they opened their gifts. It was like Christmas. - Oh about your gift. - Well, now, Johnny, I wasn't hinting. I have everything I need. - Well, I hope you like emeralds. - Johnny. - Here take it. It's yours. - Me, but it's genuine. - So are you. You know, it bothers me when I see beautiful stones on undeserving fingers. - Oh, Johnny, look it even opened. Oh, Johnny, you had something engraved. How nice. Some initials. - Initials? - Yes, RD to JD. - Now you know one of the rules I broke. Playing cards with a stranger, and he couldn't pay his losses. He gave me this instead. I'll have your name put on it. - Please. I want it just as it is, initials and all. Besides, if I give you the ring, I might never get it back. - Why do you say that? - Oh, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. It, it's just that I'm superstitious about returning gifts even for a little while. Perhaps I think it's bad luck. I don't know. Mother says it's plain silly. - Well, she's right. Give it to me. - Oh no please, let me keep it. It doesn't matter where you got it. It's still the most beautiful present I ever had. Thank you, Johnny. Thank you so much. Wait till mother sees it. - There you are, ladies. I told you that this trick would-- - Oh no! Well, one of the tricks don't work. You keep laughing. - Let them laugh, oh disciple. If this one works for the next trick we may turn them both into carrots. As you can see, ladies, this is but a simple kerchief. There's nothing here, and there's nothing here. And this container... A hem. This container. - Oh. - This container is but a bare receptacle, empty of all but air and enchantment. And now my disciple shall fascinate and enchant you with a feat of magic that is guaranteed to defy any and all explanation. Once again, dear ladies, I give you that great magician, Dauntless Douglas. - Abracadabra, abracadabra, abracadabra. - Did you follow all my instructions? - Sure. It worked, look! It worked! - Well naturally. And that, oh patient audience, concludes tonight's performance. That's very good. - Good boy, Douglas. - The best I ever saw. - Oh I'll get it, mother. It's time for you to pick up the toys and hit the hay. - Now? Yes now. Or I'll turn you into a carrot, oh disciple. - Johnny, you do work magic. - What do you mean? - Well just look at him. Any other time he'd be having conniption. He hasn't been this happy in a long time. None of us have. - Well, to tell you the truth, Mom, neither have I. Here I'll do that. - Now you are going to sit down. You haven't stopped moving since you got here. Now here's tonight's paper. Read it. That's an order. And take off that silly mustache. Doug, you look like a real magician. - Wait til the guys see the act. Wow. - Be sure you get everything. - I can't get this one back in, Uncle Johnny. - Well, you just leave it, Doug. I'll take care of it. - Why did you tear the paper? - Oh, I, I was gonna try something I saw on television here. - But that's tonight's paper. - Let's see now. It's supposed to come out just like a ladder. See. Ah. - You goofed - I sure did. - Johnny. Don't think you're putting anything over on me. Now you finish picking up, Doug. - I guess I got carried away. - Oh, well, no harm done. The only interesting news lately has been the recipes. - Recipes, in a newspaper? Well, that reminds me of a new French cookbook I saw New Orleans. Even the ones that you can't understand make your mouth water. Madame, it is yours if you will cook for me occasionally. - Be happy to, and not just occasionally. All right, now you. Upstairs. If Lily hadn't called you would have been asleep already. Oh, Mom. - Who's Lily? - Lily, Lin Kirby. She married Jim Kirby five years ago. You remember him. - Oh, Kirby's real estate. I used to deliver papers to that big house of theirs on the hill. - Mr. Kirby died last year. - Did he? That old pirate. He sure had the real estate in this town tied up - Now, Johnny, he was a nice man. - Yeah, he was a pirate. Do you know, that's a nice business, real estate. - If you'd like, I could talk to Lin about it. I'm sure she'd be willing-- - Oh, wait a minute, Mom. Hold on. I was only thinking out loud. But if I did decide to stay, that would be a nice business. - Helen, he's thinking of staying. I can tell. - I hope so. It'll make Doug so happy. - Come in. - I finally got Doug settled. Thought you might like a snack. - Thanks, Helen. - Mother tells me you might stay. You might go into business here. - I've been thinking about it. - Oh, that would be wonderful. I've got to tell Doug you'll be staying. - Now wait a minute. Don't say anything. Not yet. It depends on too many things. - Money? - No. Money is the easy part now. - You're worried about living here, aren't you? - What do you mean by that? - Well, after the way you've traveled and everything, it might be too quiet here for you. - Oh, but that's what I want, Helen. That's what I want to be sure of. Quiet. No, there are other things to be considered. - What other things? - I don't know about some of them myself. Not yet. But I should soon. One way or the other. - You know which way we hope, Johnny? All of us. I know one thing you don't think I know. - You do? There was something in the evening paper about you. - About me? - That's why you pretended to make a game out of it so you could tear it out. - Well, you are observant, aren't you? - You looked so much like Dougie when you were doing it, with that secret little boy look I can tell a mile away. He can't hide anything from me either. There, what's it say? - It's none of your business. - Johnny! - Drop it! - Oh! You hurt me. - Oh, I'm sorry, Helen. Believe me. I don't know what came over me. - What's the matter? - Well, it's nothing. It's, it's just that it's about someone I knew of, a friend. Ugly gossip. I didn't want anybody to read it. It made me angry. You understand? - I guess so. - You do forgive me, don't you? - Of course, Johnny. Of course. - Helen, promise me you'll never get angry with me. - I promise. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Helen. Hey, hey Mom! Shh! Do you have to be so noisy? - I can do it, Mom. I can. - Well sure you can. Oh, hi. Did we wake you? - Look at me, Uncle Johnny. It's my new bike. Come on down. - Oh Johnny, I was just going to knock. Mrs. Armstrong next door called and-- - What's Doug doing with a bike? - Well, Helen got it for him this morning from Mr. Cooper across the street. - I don't want him to have it. - Johnny, it's a bargain. And Doug's been dreaming of a bike. He's going to need it now. He's getting a paper route. - Mom, don't you know what you're doing? - But he'll only use it in the neighborhood. He won't be crossing any streets. - I only crossed one that day. Mom, Doug doesn't have to earn any money. He doesn't have to go to work. And I don't want him on a bike. Do you hear? - Johnny, calm down. - Do I have to show you the soar to remind you? You know what can happen to a kid on a bike? - Johnny, there's no reason to get so excited. Now you can talk to Helen or to Dougie about it. They'll understand. - All right. I'm sorry, Mom. - Are you getting a headache? - No no, I'm all right. I'm still over tired from the trip, I guess. - Well, why don't you go back to bed? I'll bring your breakfast up. - You don't have to do that, Mom. I'm all right, honest. I'll be down soon. Don't say anything to Helen or Doug. I'll take care of it. - All right. - I forgot to kiss you good morning. - It's stuck, that's all. - Mom, the team's supposed to warm up in 10 minutes. - They can warm up without you. - No, they can't. I've got the bat. - There. - Hi, how about some breakfast? - It's all ready for you, but you'll have to hurry. - What's going on around here? - Something stupid. We're gonna be interviewed. - Doug. - That's what I came up to tell you before. Rose Armstrong next door called. - Interviewed, why? - One of the San Francisco papers picked us a typical street in a typical town. It's got everybody in an uproar. - When did all this happen? - This morning. They do it like that without warning to assure you're being typical, which is why we are all dressed up. - Now, after you finish your breakfast why don't you put on a tie and jacket? - What for? - Well, they'll be taking pictures of all of us. It's part of the interview. - Well, I don't want any part of it, and I don't think you should either. - You tell 'em, Uncle Johnny. - You keep quiet. - Why, what's the matter? - Plenty. I've been working hard and I came home to get a good rest. Now I find the house will be full of snoopers asking a lot of stupid questions. - Johnny, if I dream-- - Well, did you have to say yes to them? - Johnny, if you don't wanna be interviewed, you don't have to. It's not important enough to get upset about. It's just that it's the first time anything like this ever happened to us. And we thought it would be nice if you were included. But if you'd rather, you can go off and play baseball with Doug or anything. We don't mind. - Would you play, Uncle Johnny? Would you? - No, not now. - Oh, Johnny, what's the matter? - Maybe I better go lie down for a while. I don't think I got enough sleep. - I knew you weren't feeling right. That's why you've been getting so upset. You do need rest. - Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Mom. Helen, I didn't mean to blow up. - That must be them. - Better let them in, Mom, go ahead. I'll sneak up the back stairs. I might look a little too typical for them. - But Johnny, your breakfast? - I don't feel good either. - What do you mean? - I don't know. I think I need exercise. - We'll have them take your picture first, and then you can go, all right? - All right, but they won't like it. - Why not? - Because I'm gonna look like this. - Oh! - That looks fun. Okay, you ready? Swing! Got it! - Can I go now? - You sure can. Sorry we held you up. - That's okay. I'll be there in a minute on my bike. - Doug, wait. Don't take your bike. - Why not? - Because you don't know how to ride it yet. - What kind of reason is that? - Well, now, Mrs. Walters, how many years have you lived here? - Almost 40 years. Both my children were born in this house. - Well, how long since your husband passed away? - It'll be 10 years in April. - Oh, and your son, who just got back. You say he's been gone about six years? - Yes, but I'm afraid whatever information you want about him, you'll have to get from me. He's been working very hard and he came home to rest. - Oh, he's not well? - He was in an accident when he was quite young, a bad accident. The doctor said he'd always have to take very good care of himself, otherwise he'd get relapses. The doctor said that if-- - Mother, Mr. Randall isn't doing a clinical survey, he wants to know what we're like, not how we feel. - Well now that brings me to you. - To begin with, I feel fine. - I'm glad. And, and what are you like? - Well, a little dull, I'm afraid. - Helen, don't say that. She's far from dull. She not only teaches school, but she acts in our little theater group here. And she's a den mother. - I have my scars to prove that. - You are Mrs. Walter's too, aren't you? - Yes, my husband died a year ago. - My oldest son, Larry. It was his heart. - Oh, I'm so sorry. Well, I see you got the kitchen. - Um hum. - Dear, but I hadn't finished cleaning it up. - Oh it was fine. So was the cake that was out there too. I hope you don't mind. - Mind, I took it out, and then I forgot to bring it in. - Oh, no please don't bother, Mrs. Walters. - No bother, you'd like some coffee? - Oh, we'd love it. - I'll get the cups, mother. - Mrs. Walters, how many rooms do you have upstairs? - Three bedrooms in the back. - Oh, well, that's fine. We'd like to get some shots of those, too. Is that all right? - Well, my brother-in-law's probably asleep. Oh, we'll be very quiet, I promise. - You'll never know we're there. - Just the one shot of each room. - I'd rather you didn't. He really isn't feeling too well. - Oh, well gee, it seems such a shame not to cover the house completely. Between us, it shows more taste than any of the others. - I'm sorry. Maybe some other time. - Okay, some other time. - I hope there's enough here for you. - Oh enough! There's much too much. - Oh, speak for yourself, John. I'll have another piece of that cake. - What's the icing here? - Well, it's a seven minute icing on a Lady Baltimore cake. - Oh, you're a very clever girl. Well, thank you very much. And I hope it weren't bother. - Not at all. It was our pleasure. - Bye. - It was my pleasure. - Thank you. - Bye. - Wasn't it exciting? - If only Johnny had been feeling all right. Johnny. I thought you were asleep. - I was, I slept like a baby. - And we woke you making all this noise. - Well, I didn't hear a thing. How did it go? - Fine. It was exciting. - Good. Now, where's Doug playing? - In the park. - I think I'll take a run over there. - Why, you need the rest. - Oh, because I promised him. That's why. - That's Johnny. Even when he was a child promises were sacred to him. If you broke one, it was awful. - What do you mean? - Well, before the accident, it wasn't so bad. But afterwards, he'd become like a different boy. He'd get so angry. You couldn't hate him for it. He was always so sweet later. - Oh no! It's ruined! - I'm sorry, Helen. I, I didn't see it when I backed out. It was in the driveway. Poor Dougie, loved it so. - I'll make it up to him in another way, Mom. You know I will. Don't look so worried, Helen. I will, I promise. - Mother, the bike wasn't in the driveway. It was on the walk. - Oh? - He did it deliberately, why? - I guess because he didn't want Doug to have it. He, he was afraid for him. - Couldn't he tell Doug that instead of this? - Sometimes it's hard to understand why Johnny does things, but, oh, he doesn't mean any harm, dear. He really doesn't. - Mr. Randall - Hi, Mrs. Walters. Well, this is a surprise. I was just debating whether I should call you or not. - Why? - Well I guess I've been thinking about you since this morning. - Before or after you took Johnny's picture? I'd like to talk to you. I think this is the time for complete honesty between us, Mr. Randall. I'll start by saying I don't believe you're here to do interviews at all. What do you want with our family? - Mrs. Walters... - Tell me, please. - Well, let me tell you one thing. When I first came here to this town, I just hadn't counted on dealing with decent people. - You're a detective, aren't you? - No, wait, believe me. After meeting you and your mother-in-law, I wish I'd never been assigned. - Assigned to what? - Well, I shouldn't tell you this, but it's for your own protection. There's a dangerous man loose and we're after him. - What man? - Well, that's just it. We don't know. We don't really know what he looks like. - Then what is that to do with us? - We think it might be Johnny Walters. - Why this whole thing's ridiculous. Johnny, a dangerous man? I don't know where you're from, Mr. Randall, but I think you ought to go back and stop playing games. - Mrs. Walters, this is not a game. No matter how you feel I beg you, don't mention this to anyone, anyone at all - Why not? You couldn't look any more foolish than you do right now, you know. - Maybe, Mrs. Walters. But even if it means my being charged with false arrest, if I don't have your word, I'll arrest him right now. - Arrest Johnny? - Yes. And then I hope that the picture we sent back for identification proves it. - It won't prove anything. You're wrong. Johnny's good. He's kind. - Look, I can well believe that, when he can be. - What do you mean? - How well do you really know Johnny? - He's my brother-in-law. - Yes, but you didn't know him before he left here. You only met him on a visit six years ago. Now, what's he been doing for the last six years? Where did he get all the money he's got now? - Is that what you suspect Johnny of being? A thief? - No. A murderer. - No. - Mrs. Walters, okay, if it's any small consolation, there's another man under strong suspicion too. He's being hunted in the east. - Then he's the one you want. Why don't you go and arrest him and leave us alone. - Look, please believe one thing. If, if I'm right, if your brother-in-law is the man we want, I'll try and make it as easy as possible for you and his mother. We'll get him out of town quietly. We won't arrest him here. - You did say it could be the man in the east, didn't you? - Yes, could be. Look, I, I hope I'm wrong about your Johnny. I never wanted to be so wrong in my life. - Sol put him in a cab, and I shipped him right outta Monte Carlo. - I think that's the funniest thing I ever heard. I really must be going. I just came by to see if Helen was here. It's been an hour. Before I go, you have to tell me what finally happened to him. - I don't know. I had to leave the Riviera for Algiers that same night. - Algiers. Isn't that the place that the man said, "Come with me to the Casbah?" Is it really romantic? - Well the Casbah is like no other place on earth. It's like something right out of the Arabian Knights. It's romantic. It's mysterious. It's dangerous. Where are you going, Johnny? Get some cigarettes upstairs. I'm out. Easy boy, quiet! Quiet now! Quiet, quiet boy! Easy now! - Please, Miss Brighton. Just this once. It's awfully important. - If I make one exception, Helen, I'll have to make a hundred. You know that. - I'm sorry Mrs. Brighton, but there's something I've just got to see. It's in yesterday's paper. - Oh, dear. Now I'll be late for the committee meeting. Janice Dawson. J.D. Janice Dawson. - Take it easy. I didn't mean to scare you. I was waiting for you. Where'd you go? - Shopping. I couldn't find anything. - No, I mean the second time when Lin was there. - Out, I had to go out. - That's quite a gal, Lin. You know, she hooked me into giving a travel lecture for her club tomorrow. Mom wants to give a luncheon after. What do you think? What's the matter, Helen? Oh, it's still the bike, isn't it? Well, look, if you're worried about Doug, forget it. You know how I feel about him. I've already made it up to him. I'm buying him and his team a regular clubhouse. A thousand dollars worth of clubhouse. Helen, what is it? - Why don't you go away? Why don't you go back to wherever you were. - Helen! Why did you say that? Last night you asked me to stay. You wanted me to. - Things are different now. - Different, how are they different? What's happened? - If you have any love for mother, for Doug, you'll go away and never come back. - Now don't talk like that. It's not just them I love. You know that, don't you? I want stay here and make a life for myself, for all of us. - Don't! Leave me alone! - Helen? Helen, listen. I am gonna get this straightened out if it's the last thing I do. All right now, what's bothering you? - You know, Johnny, you know. - I don't know what you're talking about. - How could you come here after, after... - After what? I said after what? - Oh! - You think you know something about me? Well, whatever it is I'll tell you this. You don't know anything. How could you? Why you've been sheltered, protected all your life. You've never been forced to find out what a jungle this world really is, or how rotten the people are who run it and make the rules. All of them. Every one of them. You rip the fronts off their houses, right here, everywhere. What do you find? A lot of selfish, miserable animals. Stupid women smelling of money they never earned, dripping with diamonds they traded their souls for. Yes, and worked their husbands to death for. Why, they're not even animals. They're parasites. They're not even worth the air they breathe. - Is that what you thought of Janice Dawson? - Who? - Janice Dawson. - I don't even know what you are talking about. - She had diamonds, didn't she, Johnny? Rings? - Oh, is that what's got you so upset? That little thing? - Don't you have any feelings? - Oh, yes Helen. Lots. Lots I haven't told you. - Don't touch me. - Helen. - And I'm warning you, if you are still here tomorrow morning, I know somebody to go to about it. - What do you mean? - Somebody who'd like to see this ring. Now let me in. - Helen, I've got to talk to you. - Are you going to let me in or aren't you? - Helen, there's things you don't understand. You don't, Helen. You don't! You listen to me, you hear? - Do you want me to wake mother up? - All I want you to do is listen to me and know how much I have to stay here. - Stay here. You wanna stay here even now? You are the one who wasn't human. - Helen, you promised. Thanks, Mom. Say, I thought Lily's club was a breakfast club. - It is. But they're all on diets. Besides, they do more talking than eating. You'll be grateful that I'm feeding you now. - Mom don't want any breakfast, Grandma. - No breakfast? - She ain't coming with us either. - Why, isn't she feeling well? - Sure, she said she had to go somewhere else. - I don't understand this. - I'll go up and see. - You tell her that Billy's stopping by to pick us all up and she'll be terribly disappointed. - Hello? Oh, hello, Mr. Randall. News? About Johnny? Are you sure? - Uh huh. Yeah, I'll read you the wire. Dawson murder suspect killed last night resisting arrest in New York. Case closed, return at once. Which means Johnny Walters is innocent. How about that? Hello? Still there? - Yes. - Well aren't you happy about it? Yes, yes, of course I'm happy. - Yes, I thought you would be. Look, I, I don't leave till this afternoon. The train's at one. - Did he confess, the man in New York? - Well, I don't see how if he was killed resisting arrest, but they must feel satisfied if they closed the case. Um, I was wondering if I could see you. Maybe for lunch? - Lunch? I'll have to let you know. - Convinced? Oh, I didn't mean to listen in. I I just thought the call was for me. - Did you hear everything he said? - Enough. Now, how about some hot waffles and a new slant on life? What's the matter? - I don't know. There's so many things I can't figure out. - Oh, forget them. All you have to know is what's important. How I feel about Mom and Doug, and how I'd like to feel about you. Nothing else. - I can't, Johnny. I just can't. - Why not? You just heard I was innocent at whatever it is you thought I did. What more do you want? - I wanna know about this. I have to know, the initials J.D. Were they Janice Dawson's? - What if I told you they're not? - I want Mr. Randall to tell me. It's where I was going when he phoned. - Helen, can't you see what you're doing to me? Why? - Because I'd never be able to look at you without thinking of that story in the paper and being afraid that maybe-- - And there's probably millions of women with the same initials. I told you how I got the ring. I don't know how the fellow got in. Could have been his mother's. - Then why don't we go find out? - No. - Why, why not? - Can't you trust me, Helen? Can't you trust me at all? - Only if I'm not afraid of you, Johnny. - Don't do it, Helen. - I'm sorry, I have to be sure. - For the last time, Helen, I'm warning you. Don't do it, Helen. Helen, Helen! - Don't! Don't you come near me! - Mom! - Helen, what happened? Nothing. Step broke. I'm all right. - Oh, you might have been killed. - Mother! - Mom! Mom, what's the matter? Mom? - I'm all right, really, I... I just ran too fast, that's all. - You better take a pill. - Just come on. - Honestly, nothing's wrong. There. - You want any more? - No thank you. - Maybe you ought to take another pill, Mom. - What for, I don't need it. - Well, if they calm you, one more can't hurt. - Ah, one more would put me to sleep. You don't know how powerful they are. Johnny, would you please put up a barricade so that no one can use the stairs till we get them fixed? - Sure, Mom, don't worry. - Now then will everybody please come in and finish breakfast? I'm fine. Come on, Doug, Helen. Lily will be here soon. She always has a tizzy when she has to wait. - What are you going to do? - I'm going to get you out of here. - Now wait a minute, Helen. - You wanted to kill me. - No, I didn't. I begged you not to go, didn't I? I couldn't hurt you. - Then who else did you fix those steps for? - That was an accident. - I know those steps, Johnny. Somebody tampered with them. - Well, I didn't do it. Believe me. Somebody else did. - Who, Johnny, who? - Somebody who was frightened running. Helen, I don't wanna run. I wanna stay here. - You could have killed mother too. - Now don't say that. I love her. - And so do I. That's why you're getting out of here. - Who are you calling? - Mike Randall. - How can you do this to Mom? You know what today means to her. Do you want to kill her? - It's nine o'clock now. You should be finished at the club by 11. You can be all packed here by 11:30. So think of a good excuse, Johnny. - For what? - For mother. For why you have to leave so suddenly. Because I'm bringing Mike Randall here at 12. Maybe I shouldn't, but I'm giving you a half hour head start. Hello, Mr. Randall's room, please. Hello, Mr. Randall. This is Helen Walters. Could I come down to the station? - Helen, Johnny? Everything's getting cold. - I'm coming. - Yes, I'll be there for sure. - I'll feel much better if I know she's had something to eat. You know, I was so surprised when she said she had a headache. Helen doesn't get headaches. You think we ought to call the doctor? - No. I think something's bothering her. Something deep. - What do you mean? - She talked an awful lot about Larry last night, about the way he died so suddenly. Now don't you mention it to her. - Of course not, but she hasn't talked about it in months. I thought she was over it. - Maybe it's still working inside of her. - Poor dear. What are you doing? - Oh, I think warm milk would be better for her, don't you? - Of course. I should have thought of it. Now the marmalade. Where did I put the marmalade? Don't get it too hot. Just take the chill off of it. - I will, Mom. - Now let's see. I think I have about everything. Milk ready? - Yeah. Sure you don't want me to take it up? - No, I better do it. I'll see that she eats. Lily's here. - Well tell her I'll be right in. - But you've got to have something. - I will later. Don't worry about it. Go on, you'll be late. - At least drink your milk. - I will, Mother. - Now, while it's warm, please. A little more. - There, now will you go? - I feel terrible going to Lily's meeting without you. - I'll be fine. Don't worry about it. Better hurry. - Try to get some sleep. We'll be back at 11. - Poor Helen. I know what a headache can be. I get the most awful migraines. - Well, actually, it's not a headache. She's still brooding over Larry. - Oh, I thought I'd never get over my Jim. But I did it. I made myself. I hope you don't mind driving, Mr. Walters. - Don't you think it's about time you started calling me Johnny? - Of course, Johnny. I always feel so much safer when a man drives. - Ah, how could I forget? - What's the matter? - Well, I've got some pictures and souvenirs. Even some records I want to bring. Now you go on ahead and I'll take my car. - Oh, we don't mind waiting - No, you better go on. I've gotta go through a whole pile of stuff. I'll see you there. Goodbye, Mom. Take care of the ladies, Doug. It's too late for that, Helen. It's too late for anything. - Go away. - Oh, I don't have to go anywhere now. I'm home for good. - What did you do to me? - Oh, I was very kind. It won't hurt. You'll just go to sleep. - No. - You'll never make trouble for anybody again. - You've got to get out. Get out. - Oh, you should have listened to me when I asked you, Helen. You should have, because I wanted you alive then. Honest, I did. We could have been so happy. You and I and Doug. - Doug, Doug. - You didn't want to go my way, did you? You had to be like everybody else, spying and snooping. Why? Helen? Helen? You were right. It was Janice's. She didn't want to give it up either. - Still busy? Thanks. - What's the matter with you? - She said she'd be here in a little while. It's over an hour now. Where is she? - She's on the phone. Where else? Relax. - She doesn't stay on the phone that long. - You meet her twice and you know that? - I know that. - Well, it took me a little longer. I had to get married to find out that Phyllis can't even breathe unless it's into a phone. - I'd like to marry her. - Mrs. Walters? - Helen. - But you don't even know her. - I know her, the way I never knew anyone else. Hello? Would you try that number again for me, please? - Our train leaves at one, Mike. - I know, Roy, all right. - But that's not much time for something that important to a guy. - I-- Sill busy? All right, no wait. Would you check the line, please? Thanks. I can always come back, can't I? - Yeah, I suppose. - Well, that's all I wanna find out, if she wants me to. - It's crazy. Real crazy. - What? Thanks. - Where you going? - To her house. The phone's off the hook. - And you're off your rocker. It's crazy. - Mrs. Walters? Mrs. Walters? Mrs. Walters? Mrs. Walters? Helen? Helen? - You are very lucky, I must say. Another half hour... I don't know. - Please, doctor, don't say anything about this to mother. - Now I know better than that, Helen, but I do have to make a report. - Oh, doctor, will you please hold off on that report? I'll come by and see you about it later. - I see. But then I've got-- - Not now, sir. I'll call you. - Very well. - Thank you. Why did you do this? - I didn't. - Do you realize if I hadn't gotten here? What is the matter with you? - But I didn't. He did, Johnny, he's guilty. He's the real murderer. He tried to kill me because I knew. - Where is he? - With mother. They'll be back soon. - I'll make a call right now. - Mike, you can't arrest him here. - You called me Mike. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Sorry? I'm glad. I'll tell you why later. Right now I've gotta grab him while I can. - You can't do it here in front of mother. She'd never live through it. Isn't there another way? - But Helen, I can't take chances with him. He's dangerous, he'll fight. - No, he won't. - Well, how do you know? - He won't make a fuss in front of mother. He loves her. - No, I'm sorry. - Please, try it my way. Please, Mike. - I'm gonna go out and play. - Right this way, everybody. - Wonderful speech. - Thank you. - Really a great talk, John. - Thank you, Reverend. - That was the best speech I've ever heard. I can hear that again. - Every word was great. - Oh, I can't tell you how you thrilled everybody. It was simply wonderful. - Well, thank you. - You ought to lecture for a living. - Well, I'm more interested in real estate at the moment. - Real estate, where? - What's wrong with right here? - I'd better go up and see how Helen is. - Did you hear what Johnny just said? - No, what? - Oh he, oh he, he ought to tell you himself. He ought to tell everyone. Quiet everybody, please. Just a minute. Mr. Walters has an announcement to make. - Here here. - Thank you. - Well, I hadn't expected to make this as a public announcement, but it, it looks as if Lin has left me no choice. Well, to tell you the truth, I was just going to-- Helen, how do you feel? - Fine, I feel fine. Well, Johnny, what were you going to say? - Well, I, I was going to say that I'm sorry, but I'll be leaving here. Today. Oh? - But Johnny. - I guess I should have told you sooner, Mom, but I didn't wanna spoil your fun today. Must you go today? - Worse than that. Right now. - It's a very big opportunity, Mother. Johnny told me about it last night. - That's why you were so upset, wasn't it? - Yes. - Why didn't you tell me? I, I'm so sorry to go on like this, but it was so wonderful having all my family together again. - Of course. Of course we understand. - It is a disappointment. - You can be proud of your son, Mrs. Walters. I know we all are. - Well, Johnny, if you're going to get started I'll help you pack. - Thanks. I'll be down soon. Well, I have, I guess this is goodbye, everybody. Lin, Reverend, - Goodbye, Johnny. - Goodbye all. Goodbye Johnny. - Inside. - I see you found it. - Um hum. - Quite a collection, isn't it? - What? - Is there anything else you want us to pack? - Well, you did overlook a few things. I used to keep my treasures in here when I was a kid. Oh, it's just treasure, Mr. Randall. You see there weren't just three women. There were more. One sound out of you and I'll kill him Now get that stuff in there. Go on. Everything. Come on. - Where? - You promised me a half hour start, didn't you? This is one promise you're gonna keep. Now go on. One sound. Just one sound. You understand? Go on. - You killed him. - He'll be fine. Cops have harder heads than anybody. - He wanted to arrest you when you first came in, but he didn't for mother's sake. - Now don't give me that. He did it for you to be a big man. Big man. He's lucky I let him live. - Johnny, you don't need me. Please stop the car. Let me out. - Sure, you can run to the nearest telephone. - What are you going to do with me? - What do you think? You do that again, you hear? - Watch out! Our town has lost a son. A son she can be proud of. Brave, gentle, generous. - I'm glad you're here, Mike. I couldn't have faced it without you. Johnny thought the world was a horrible place. He couldn't have been happier. - Oh, I guess he couldn't. - He didn't trust people. He hated them. He said people like me had no idea what the world was really like, that it was a jungle. - We make our own jungles, Helen. He was just a very sick man. Let's be thankful he's at rest now.
