recruits her name's Caitlin Fairchild 18 years old high IQ she has a great Jenn factor potential she doesn't look like much to me I agree but this one was scouted by one of our operatives I've read her files and I believe that she is the progeny of one of the Rope Jen twelves a member of Team seven I think you'll agree that this one deserves special attention I'll keep an eye on her by kicker back cut baby Garmany cut Tommy all right you what some are next bear lumber oops pardon no get up off your ass miss Fairchild the world doesn't give you any breaks or second chances if this fight was real you'd be dead again Oh bet Fairchild can't - Alice morning you're hooked how'd you do fun I'm on alert or should I say Jackie Chan is getting his ass kicked but you you were an animal out there I guess I got kind of mad haha oh that's for sure how's your head Oh fine the headache went away pretty fast what are you doing uh I'm having a smoke it's the only place I didn't stick a smoke to tip um Bronx can I ask you something sure shoot what do you think of Matthew it we mean until a the hunt out there yeah I keep getting these strange vibes from him like he's watching me or something well cat

dig eyepatch oh no it's nothing like that he just he stares so intensely it's like he's waiting for something to happen it gives me the creeps maybe you're his model student his protege or something like that hmm maybe Roxy why are you here what made you want to join this program my mom she thought my boyfriend was a bad influence on me so like hmm yeah I was hoping to feel closer to my dad here he was in the military and he went missing presumed dead when I was a baby I just wanted to make him proud started following his footsteps mm yeah that's nice I don't even know who my dad is wasn't he military mmm they told me the program was for children of military vets yeah you must have heard wrong yeah I guess I'm just being paranoid aren't I that's right that headaches pickled your brain girls you you subject for Spaulding Roxanne locked and in place all the little labelings are tucked into the incubation tubes like La Vie in cocoons waiting to metamorphose into magnificent butterflies butterflies of our own creation proud complete begin sequence ivana command centers reporting in made a military aircraft seeking emergency landing request denied uh he's not requesting it's a Harrier with IO clearance shit Lynch I'll deal with this continue the experiment Matthew always glad to be helpful sir we have been assigned to escort you in how thoughtful of Ivana uh I might have gotten lost here you hello jack welcome to the Phoenix base it's cozy we call it home I am told that your jet will be ready to depart it Oh 8:30 tomorrow does it sound to me like there was much of a problem really Jack the Mayday was a bit much you never can tell these planes are so temperamental and we are out here in the middle of nowhere actually I've been hearing some curious rumors something about project Genesis gen 13 what's the matter does it get your goat that IO would use me a woman over you to head gen 13 in spite of your being you gen 12 whatever internal operations motives are I think it's a foolish project to resurrect the consequences of the experimentation oh don't be so dramatic with that attitude it's no surprise Craven wanted you kept in the dark these are human lives young human lives you are playing with Jack there is no experimentation going on it's purely observation it better be because you have no idea how dangerous the gen factor is please give me some credit we are fully prepared to an emergency arise Jack yeah well I have some first-hand experience with just such emergencies and I say you haven't a clue about what could happen breakfast is served at Oh 700 hours I'll see you there enjoy your stay he's over here you red one too big set we've got the boy looks like the infant's a scratch though out it's an honor to meet you sir an

was hoping you weren't mixed up in this what I'm familiar with your career as well and I would have thought you of all people would be opposed to this kind of government experimentation with all due respect sir I don't think you understand what it is we're trying to accomplish here then I would be happy for you to enlighten me I'm sorry but the exact nature of this program is classified of course

of contempt as the ants beneath our feet you're sick Matthew oh I did have a rather dysfunctional upbringing you see my parents were killed when I was very young I was captured and raised by their murderers we are the offspring of government meddling our parents were all gen 12 a military biological experiment to create a special fighting force when they refused to fight they were hunted down and killed now is our chance to destroy that government that corrupt diseased government that destroyed our parents and create our own oh no offense threshold put your friggin nuts dude if you won't

very impressive Roxette given a little practice you might prove a worthy adversary too bad you'll never get that chance colonel our rescue teams just searched the student dormitories they report that all the students are missing and there is evidence of a rapid evacuation then we're too late damned if I know Ivana she's managed to escape with those kids this place is gonna get a lot less healthy recall all units we're pulling out Caitlyn why give me a left I'll squash you like an insect you ass is mine dude hey dickhole you look kind of thirsty all the rocks I'll twist your head off right now you know that give me one good reason why I shouldn't you you kids should not be fighting each other try telling that to our pal over here vengeance is a powerful force Lynch I can feel it in me strengthening me and you will all feel it too pretty big talk for someone who just got his butt kicked they're not your enemy threshold Ivana and Craven are the ones who created gen 12 and Gen 13 not you Lynch not one of the government Stooges responsible for hunting down my parents like animals your parents were friends whose lives I couldn't save I'll make you eat those lies after I finish with these three you're making a mistake Matthew this is the last person that you want to harm Caitlin is your sister what I knew your parents well and was their friend Caitlin your mother Rachel came to me for help after your father was killed because the NSC wanted her to children I couldn't help your mother so she turned to her ex-husband Callaham Matthews father Callahan did the honorable thing and tried to get all of you out of the country but he didn't make it he and your mother were killed Matthew you RAM ran for your life with your baby sister in your arms and when they fished you out of the water your sister was gone you thought she was dead I found her downriver I was too late to save you and your mother Matthew but I could still help Kaitlin I hid her away and when it was safe when the program was no longer popular I returned Kaitlyn to her uncle the dream I've been having your dream I don't like the looks of this everybody into the ship now all right take off go go Matthew hang on back there this is gonna be rough sweet Jesus all left coming down you that's our third pass girl still no sign of life down there alright captain let's head for home hey mr.
