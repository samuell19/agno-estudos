Mom is on a holiday. - Holidays, huh? 767 You know, my mom's on holiday too and I wish she would never come back. My mom forced me to count so much change that to this day, I can tell by weighing a handful of coins exactly how much money that is. 21 divided by 3. She could have bought a machine to count all the coins but she claimed that she doesn't trust machines or employees and would rather have me count. I believed her at the time. It took me years to realize that she's actually greedy as fuck. I can't help it. That's the world I grew up in. And this would've been it if I didn't force my parents to change their plans. It got pretty ugly when I told them I don't want anything to do with this. Basically, I had to blackmail them. Oh, I'm their only child. So I kidnapped Mom's dog. My mom would only get her back if they let me go to college. - Uh, you're-you're... - Weird. Yeah, I know. And that's how I became a computer scientist. 72 divided by 6. - W-what's a computer- - Computer scientist? I guess it's a job I never even dared to dream of when I first started counting change in here with a mom who barely spoke English at the time. My mom missed her dog so much that one day she came to my room ready to negotiate. They would finally let me go to college. On one condition: I have to look after the business on holidays so after 25 years of work - they could finally - take some time off. And that was our deal. Shut up. Why does she have a- w- why is her leg? - Oh, she got hit by a car. Yeah, she hasn't learned anything since. She keeps running away. Even with three legs. Sometimes my mom calls me by the dog's name. Accidentally, of course. - Seven. 823 I guess that sums up our relationship pretty well. - We gotta go. - No, he stays. He needs a desk. Where are you going? - Work. - Feels good, huh? Don't forget to pack that too. Keep it. You saved my ass. What? Just wait. Okay, let me go change and then we can go for a walk. I feel like it's worked out for the best because we all love her. You know, I mean, who wouldn't love a dog? Come on. There are no cars. I like the thought of being the only person in the world, like, the last life in the universe. Sometimes when I look at the night sky I think about how small we like to make ourselves. Like we trick ourselves into thinking that the moon is up there and we're down here. But there's absolutely no truth to that. I mean, it's just a way of looking at things. Like, I'd much rather believe we're hovering high above it all. I see the moon down there. Doesn't that feel much better? - You're, uh, you're- - Weird. Yeah, you said that. - Yeah, but, uh- - What? - I, uh, I- I like, I like you. - Can I ask you something? Have you ever fucked a girl? You have fucked a girl, haven't you? You gay? - I'm, I'm, I-I'm 14. - So you masturbate a lot, huh? Come back to the laundromat tomorrow, you can use the shower. - Daniel. Do you have my number? Come back tomorrow And text me when you get here. I'm so sorry for what happened today. Thank you. I couldn't deny it. Yeah, I was flying in my dreams but in real life everything was falling apart.

Mom is dead. - Sit down. Sit down! What do you see? - A gun. - Speak up boy! What do you see? 928 - No. Try again. - A gun, a table. - You know, there are certain moments in life when you gotta speak up, when you gotta be loud, when you want to confront your enemy. Like when someone hits you in the face, what you going to do? You hit back, right? Then there's these other moments when you gotta stand down, look away. Shut your mouth. You follow me?
