Radiator finally blew, Ma. Can you come get me? I'm on road 236, just coming from the band council meeting. Oh, it got pretty rank. Oh, I said my piece. You'd be proud of me. Well, battle's sure not won yet. Ma? Ma, I can't hear you. Come on. You're welcome, for the nice breakfast I made you. Take a bite. It'll put hair on your chest. I don't need hair on my chest. What I need is some new hockey gear. Well, this rat trap of a house that nevertheless keeps us warm and dry needs a new heat pump. There's nothing wrong with used gear and that's what you're getting. So why don't you put that flyer down and look at something useful? Like the homework you neglected to do last night. Used gear smells. Plus, we got some deals. New gear smells too once you wear it a couple of times, plus girls like the smell of male odor, it excites them. You're a dictator, you know that? Worse, I'm your auntie. So drop the sullen teenager shit and eat your nutritious breakfast. Andy, what's Mary Lynne's ETA? Ok, I'll see you at the shed. - Kharis? - Mm-hmm. That's too bad about her, huh? Yeah, it is. You going to catch the guy? We certainly hope to. Any clues? There's always clues. You should CSI the shit out of it. That's a great idea. You know, I think I'll just fire up my tribal DNA lab. You got one? No, I'm lucky if I get a budget for ear muffs, but I waved Andy in and the police have all that, so. She had a hard life. Didn't she? I'm so sorry, Mary Lynne. You met Andy? The police will be assisting with the investigation. They have a crime lab, resources we don't. Me and Andy will go in first to get the physical report and then we'll bring you in for the formal identification. I want to come with you, now. I think it'd be best if you stay outside, just ready yourself. It can get very technical and disturbing. She's my daughter. I want to know. K. Um, once they transport the body pathologists will do a formal autopsy and he'll send that to the coroner. I'll see what the pathologist comes back with, but it looks like massive trauma consistent with an automobile impact, internal bleeding, road burns. Maybe she was dragged. She called. I would've come, but the line was so bad. There was nothing you could do. She overcame so much to be reduced to this. Do you know who did this? We have evidence, paint, tire marks, part of a broken headlight. We're pretty good at matching these things up. People are already calling in tips. Are you ready? Mary Lynne Redwater, are you able to identify the deceased before you? I'm sorry, you have to say it out loud. I know! Mary Lynne Redwater, is this Kharis Redwater? Yes. It's Kharis. AHHHH! I think this is it. You know, there's nothing wrong with a wedding in Vegas, Beth. Yeah, this is the spot. Are you sure this is okay, on tribal land? Band council signed a land lease yesterday. You know, I researched it, $87, a hug from Elvis, a complimentary glass of champagne, domestic I guess and easy-peasy you're on your way. No relatives, no wedding hall? That costs too much. It'd just be you and I, two lovebirds. Well, what about wedding cake and flowers? Too bourgeoisie, but I will pick you up a bouquet on the way. - Oh, you do all that for me? - Absolutely. That's so generous of you. It's just part of my great unappreciated goodness. Just think about all the money we would save for travel, for furniture... For your tricked out Shelby Cobra. I gotta throw in something for me. I'll save a little bit for the odd kid, and then a house maybe. What if a Cobra eats it all up? It won't. I'll save a little bit, just a little bit. You know what? I've got an even better idea. Yeah. What's that? How about no wedding? What?! But Beth, we love each other. Yeah well, you'd better start thinking about what you're going to lose. Oh man, it's kind of fun yanking your chain. Yeah, well, keep it up and you'll be yanking your own chain. Now you just do what I tell you and I hope you've got your long undies on, because it gets cold just standing out there. You know, it's a real drag your pole man called in sick. I will be happy to help and talk Elvis. Just looked into some used hockey gear. Oh, that's very constructive. Yeah. I can smell the hockey through the paper. Well then I suggest you breathe through your nose. Hey, and remember it's $250 max. Betty, you just don't understand, okay. I'm on the rink with these rich moonyashs, and me, this broke Rez kid with hand-me-down goalie pads and stuffing coming out. One of their mom's probably donated it. Those guys already looked down on me. Now they're going to laugh. Listen, you come from a proud people, alright. And that pride, it beats in your heart. So you just get on that ice and you make sure that heart of yours beats so loud those kids hear at like thunder and they start shaking in their jockstraps. And then you play so hard you beat the goddamn shit out of them. Huh? Move left three and a half meters. You know, I uh, I lied about the long underwear. Well, if that's the extent of your lies, then we'll have a happy marriage. Ray, do you smell something? No, just uh, clean oxygen on my end. Beth, you okay? Do you see it? See what? Beth. Beth! Beth! Beth! Beth! No, no, no, no, no. No, no. Beth. Beth. Okay- Good, just stay there for now. I don't want you going out. Just do what I say. Stay inside until I figure things out. Jesus. Looks like someone went at her with a chainsaw. Is that the husband? Fiance. She's a surveyor, just started working for WEC, scoping out plans for their base camp. He's a junior prof in economics, helping her for the day. Pretty incoherent. Babbling he saw nothing. No attacker, just blood suddenly gushing from her. Meth? That shit makes people do crazy things. We're checking. Do a full tox screen. Mr. Patel, I'm Officer Stonechild, Tribal Police. I'm sorry for your loss. She... Sh... Sm... Smelled something like, blood. Is she alive? She coming back? No, Mr. Patel, she's dead. I didn't see anything. Sir, have you been drinking? Talk Elvis. Sir, I'm going to need you to focus. Did you find the weapon? No, still looking. 9 times out of 10 it's the husband, boyfriend... Fiance. Whatever. Ben, would you promise me something? Uh, sure. Tell me that when you're big and grown you're never going to hurt a woman. I wasn't going to. All good? Next time make it more rare. Well, that would be raw. Hear you've been pretty busy at the shed? Yeah. Yeah. Ice road's out now, so it's getting pretty busy back there. Well, makes you a hero in my book. Hey, Stace- - Hmm? You ever just stand in front of the mirror? Yeah. All the time. No, I mean, just, just looking at yourself hard for a really long time. Why would I? I know what I look like. Anyway, you know what the philosophers say about that? Which one? I read so many. Okay. Well the guy I have in mind, he said that the person looking back at you, that, that reflection is fighting a really great battle. Well, wouldn't work for me. I'm the happiest person I know. I'll tell the cook you want your meat still breathing next time? That a girl. Excuse me, could you move your vehicle? No problem. I just wanted to give you something. Giving these out. Public relations. Get the natives on our side. Uh, thank you. Now, could you please move your pickup? Saw you in the diner, thought you'd look real good in it. You must live around here, huh? That's none of your business. Now please move your vehicle. I'm moving. I'm moving. I'm a digger, coal mines. Advance guard, I set up the machines, Alaska, Wyoming, Texas. Man, I travel. Now here, bring some money to the squaws. You know, their bucks. Who knows, maybe they'll be able to afford a toilet or something. It's kind of like the army. You know, you get lonely away from our loved ones. So I was thinking you might want to have dinner with me sometime. You know, I was in the army. I know what it's like. Tell you what, does get lonely out here. How about I give you my number and you move your truck? I will take that deal. Oh, you are gorgeous. Thank you. I spend most of my time with wildlife. I don't really get many compliments. I got plenty more. Where is that pen? Now get in the driver's seat and move your fucking truck! Fucking bitch. Aw, mother fuck. Hey, did you get any tox results yet? Nothing yet. Ice road is still closed. Well, do we have anything? What's his mental history? We're checking all that. Got them at the nurses station. They are keeping him sedated. Did he say anything else? He started babbling about a black bird circling them before the attack. You see anything? Just you. You know I always wanted a trophy on my wall. - You got dimples. - Eh. - But I do got a riddle for you. - Yeah. Why did they call it tourist season? You're not allowed to hunt them. That is so bad. Guess I either got to work on my material, either that, get a new audience. Hey, don't you fucking dare. Well, I ain't going nowhere without a fucking kill. That, and... Hey, Hey concentrate. You're on a mission remember? So it this legal, what we're doing? Word is, local warden got suspended. clocked one of our guys, if you could believe it, left him bleeding in the parking lot. - Why did he do that? - It was a she. - Nice. - So. Wide open season. You need a shotgun for that. Man can pretend. - You smell that. - What? Jesus, foul. What? I don't smell anything. Geez. That smell. No, no, no, no. Let's get out of here... Hey, here's my chance. I'm getting my kill. Gary? Gary? Oh my god. What the hell did this? You saw nothing? I saw um, just Gary walking towards me, he was um, holding his insides. No sound? Smell. You smelled something? Gary. I didn't. But you, you smelled nothing? I should never have come. Have you been drinking? Beer. Just beer. Had some luck, looks like? Take what you can get. Always carry that thing on your line? Might run into poachers. Some of them are nasty. What do you do then? Sometimes poachers need to be poached. Aw, like that one that got ripped to shreds by the beaches. You didn't have anything to do with that, did you? Why'd I? I dunno, since you got back from Afghanistan, you've had a few screws loose. Army shrink wouldn't argue with you, section eight. Just to reassure you, I haven't killed anyone in the past two days. That's useful, because I'm here to deputize you. What? Something's happening out here that I don't understand. You're the best tracker I know. And that arsenal that you're stockpiling might come in handy. You're allowed to just deputize people? Sure. A band member of good character, physically able and over 18 in an emergency. Yes I can. Maybe you forgot. My mom married a white guy, I'm still waiting for my status. You're a band member in my books. We'll let them worry about blood quantum later. You know though warden service just suspended me? You don't have to smack every asshole that pisses you off, you know? Fucker backed me in. Wouldn't let me leave the parking lot. That's an indictable offense, forcible confinement. I reacted to secure my own safety. Okay, well next time you feel like securing your own safety just file a report instead, or call me. Noted officer. Besides I needed that dose of violence. I think you need to get back to that shrink. So are you in? Let's do this. They look like animal wounds? You know what kind? I've seen most, we're trained for that. Keep track of predation. Who's hunting who. But this here, and this, wasn't something looking to just kill, this is something looking for a meal. You think it's...? Stace. Stace! Where are you going? You asked me to help. That's what I'm doing. It's hard to believe, but the survivors say they never saw the attacker. Just the victim's blood flying in the air. No sense of who or what was doing it. - There was a bird, right? - Yeah. Black one, circling overhead. And before the attacks, the victim smelled something. Dead animals. What's Betty say about all this? Well she's following the empirical line. Meth, psychosis, weird cult running around out there maybe. So why are you out here telling me this instead of her? I can tell she's wavering. Wondering if something else is going on. Type of thing you might understand. But right now, whatever she's coming around to thinking she can't say out loud or they'll call her nuts and take her off the case. So this is on me. On you, huh? Look at you, all deputized and everything. Still got your usual arsenal? Like a sorority girl's makeup bag. Won't go anywhere without it. Alright. Surveyor is killed here. Poacher here. It's not listed, but right around here there's a creek and... Even predators need to drink. You got it. I'll take point. Remember when I first took you hunting, and we ran into that bear? Smell. Carson. Carson. Hang on Carson. Hold on there. I've lost too many, I can't afford to lose you too. Ok, got it? Yeah. Alright. - It was... - Shh, don't say its name. - It was Kharis. - Huh? - Kharis. - Kharis? You went without me? I wanted to keep you out of it. I was afraid they'd think you were crazy. Hear you're out there running after things you can't see, it was just til we knew for sure. Knew what? Carson, he- He said, whoever did this was hungry. So he baited her, brought her to us. Baited who? He said it was Kharis. I saw her too, just a flash, like a, a corpse covered in dirt, blood around her mouth. I opened up with everything I had. There was nothing to see, I was shooting at air. Sounds crazy. But... Maybe... That saved Carson. So... So she's out there. I'm sorry. He's lost a lot of blood, but he's as tough as a mule. I know him. How come nobody let me in on this? It was a special circumstance, there wasn't enough time. Why is she here? She was with him. I deputized her. Does the crime scene checkout? Okay. That Jessica girl with the poacher, blood alcohol 0.15, some THC. That's not enough to trigger a delusion. Not in somebody who's sane to begin with. There's a lot of people out here, Betty, living in the bush. Isolation can be worse than any drug. Are you familiar with mass hysteria? - What?! - 1879. Cree Hunter, Swift Runner, takes his family to an isolated hunting camp, has a vision. Says a spirit told him to kill his family, eat them. So he complies, down to his infant daughter. Hey. Doesn't bother hiding the bones. Belcher Island, Inuit Shaman saw a meteor declared it a sign he was Jesus Christ ordered six of his relatives onto the ice, where they froze to death. - One case after the other. - So you're saying... I'm saying that sometimes an idea... fear gets into a community, spreads. People see things they would never see, do things they would never ordinarily do. These are my people, Andy, my band. They're not a bunch of hysterics, running wild, ripping people open. It doesn't have to be a lot of people. We need to get a team of psychologists down here when that damn road opens! And I need to get back. We'll talk. Her heart. Where is her heart? Hey. Hey, uh... I looked online today. I found some delicately used pre-owned equipment. I used your credit card. Altogether it was $241. Saves you nine bucks. We'll blow it on a night on the town, burgers should do it. And I'll spot you for the fries. You do know the way to a woman's heart. Hey, you okay? We'll see. She is beautiful there, no? Sorry. I didn't see you. Lost in my own thoughts. Yes, she is beautiful. You were right to be proud of her. It was an honor. I offered to buy her a car when she got that diploma, she said, "old age is creeping up on you Ma, save your money." She was right. I still remember all the times she'd come by my cabin. We'd drink coffee, strictly decaf for her because she said- she said she'd had so much illegal stuff on the street, she was afraid. She was afraid any kind of stimulant might make her backtrack. She was hard on herself. Red road was important to her. She fought to stay on it. She was a real fighter. Yes. She was. It's happening. Carson... Carson. Ben. Show me that Kharis video you took. I got a B plus. You don't have to check on everything I do. I just need to see it, it's for my work. Oh, okay. I've heard what some of the band members are saying, and yes, we need a new school, a new rink, a treatment center. But look around, other reserves have those things without digging up the bones of our elders, polluting the land the Creator gave to sustain us. When I was away in the city, on the streets, I lost my soul. When I came back here, I remembered who I was. I don't want to lose that again. Yes, there are problems. But this precious land we walk on, the creek we fish from, draw water, the forest we hunt in, all part of the blood and soul of each and every one of us. And to mutilate all that with a strip mine, this is not the way of our ancestors and us- Hey, come back here. You hear that band councillors? You listen to her. You went behind our backs. No consultation, no advance warning. We wake up one morning to discover WEC is digging up the ground from under us. We had to cut out that last part. The teacher was afraid that the band would retaliate or do something crazy, like cancel the hockey program. Too bad though. Should've put those two and Carson in the same video, see some real sparks. - You videoed Carson? - Yeah. Uh, teacher said we should get a real and respected elder. And so we had to trudge all the way out to his cabin. Lucky a bear didn't get us. Show me. Oh. Um, now? Well, uh, this morning woke up with the sun, smudged, had breakfast, went out to my trap line. Same as every morning. No one around for miles. Just me and my one true love Mother Earth. Now, uh, Ben here's asked me to speak as an elder, but, and I know what you're thinking, yeah here comes another lecture from good old, crazy Carson, right? Well, truth and matter is, my life wasn't always like this. And with everyone at odds over this WEC thing. Well, I figure it's maybe better I just cut to the chase. Too many of us are losing ourselves to alcohol and those goddamn drugs. I know because was one of them. And I know reconnected to my culture helped me get off that path. But I also grabbed onto opportunities and when you mix those two things together. Well, that's one powerful thing. That's why I was able to be there for my niece, Stacey. I was able to raise her, give her the gift of our culture and opportunity. And I sure as hell didn't do it living on fresh air and sunshine. Our people need growth. Our land, she's precious. And men that come to our lands, well, they're definitely outsiders, but they're outsiders offering something. They're promising something precious, training. And that means opportunity to build our people, but we need to stick together. We got to watch them like hawks, make sure we hold them to it. He promises jobs. Let's hold them to it. They promise us something to build off of for future generations of our people to come. Let's hold them to it. We need to take that chance. You know, I love the forest, creeks, creatures, everything the Creator gave us, I love it all. But the truth of the matter is we're out here on our own and we're losing too many of our people. As much as I love all of this, I love my people more. And that means all of you. After, he showed us how to make Spruce Tea. Cool guy. Huh? Her heart. Where is her heart? Oh, hey Betty, what's up? Where's Kharis' body? Uh-uh, it was transported. Where? The road's not opened. Yeah. The pathologist, he was actually able to... What's his name? Which morgue? You know, I'm going to have to check in the files. Show me the transport order. Okay. Um, yeah, they're mixed in with the diner stuff right now the paperwork's chaos right now. It's in your computer. Betty, we've-we've had a bug in the system for weeks. I can't actually access any... Do you know what this is? - Is it pretty stone... - Stop lying to me! This is a Buffalo stone. It belongs to the Blackfoot. It's sacred to them. It's found only on their territory. It belongs to them and not you. It was a gift. You're play acting with your drum circles and your round dance. That's not fair! We honor those traditions. You honor nothing! You know nothing! The body, what happened to it?! - I don't know... - The body? Where is it? Mary Lynne. You ask Mary Lynne where her daughter's body is. You here to arrest me? Not today. Your Mountie won't be pleased. How is he? Same. Look, I gotta show you something. That's surveyor, Beth, out there peacefully doing her job, smelled something awful, saw something, ran, got ripped apart. Her fiance, helping her out for the day, smells nothing, sees nothing, just blood spurting out from his bride to be. He's left alone, he survives. Who does she work for? WEC, about to start mining the shit out of the reserve. That poacher in the pickup got himself gutted, his girlfriend Jessica, again sees nothing, smells nothing, like Ray was left alone, unharmed. WEC. - Kharis hated WEC. - Big time. But, Carson has got nothing to do with them. Men that come to her lands, definitely outsiders, they're outsiders, offering something they're promising something precious, training. And that means opportunity to build our people. But we need to stick together. She came after him because of that speech. And he saw her. She revealed herself to him. But I saw her too. She was going to attack me. Because you tried to defend Carson. You became his ally, and that puts you on side with WEC. When I was 10, Carson took me hunting. I saw two bear cubs and I followed them, but I wandered away too far. I couldn't see him anymore. And then I heard something behind me. I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up and I could smell her. I looked over my shoulder, there she was, the mother. I heard a shot, and then she fell. He saved me. Now you saved him. That was the first time I ever felt the power of a gun. I grew up with myths. The tales from my Kokum, scary stories, spirits, cannibals, foxes in the night, crying out, open doors, whistle at the Northern lights and they'll come down and take you away. These spirits they're still here, they've just been pushed to the side of your brain. One of them is pushing back, standing in front of us. Not Kharis anymore. Not going to let your Mountie friend in on this? He has his theories, I have mine. Besides what am I supposed to tell him? Order WEC to shut down the entire operation because the angry spirit of a dead nishi is eating the innards of its employees. He'd lock me up. He'd probably take my badge. Even if these miners in London or China, or wherever the hell paid any of this some credence, doubt it would make a difference. Money matters more to these guys than people. Andy. Christ. Stone Crossing Road by the pines? There's been another. Andy's already there. Follow me and don't say anything. Game on. Yeah. Sorry Man. Aggie. It's a gunshot wound to the shoulder. Guy was packing a 32. The docs still have to look at your friend, but far as I can see nothing critical. Our cowboy here got spooked. Oh, yee-haw. That's Aggie Foxchild, she's one of our elders. How the hell am I supposed to know? I'm just getting the lay of the land here. And I see something moving in the woods and it spooked me. Yeah, I yelled out, "Who's there?" I got no answer. So I figured maybe it's whoever or whatever has been slicing and dicing all the other people around here. You fucking moron! You shot an 81 year old grandmother who's stone Deaf, can't hear a thing. That's why she didn't respond. She's an herbalist. She was probably gathering plants. Again, how the hell was I supposed to know? By using your goddamn eyes! She should have bells on. Why do you have a firearm? Well, you're your little sexy minx over there has a gun. How do you think I got this pretty little nose? She's a game warden, which makes her a federal peace officer. Who the hell are you? Betty, I got it, Betty. Okay, I'm already booking him. I'm taking him to jail as soon as I get Aggie some help. Piss and a phone call. Okay, it's getting out of hand. I was afraid this would start happening. Just remember what I was saying. We got to end this. I know. That's what I'm trying to do. Hey. Game on. Been busy, hey? You don't know the half of it. I saw you the other day. At the uh, hit and run site. Just paying my respects, best as I can. Thanks. I knew Kharis a bit. Authorized a permit for that anti mine demonstration she organized, I let her block the road for a few hours. That was Kharis. I'm all for pulling the energy out of the ground myself, but you sure had to respect her. Especially after everything she went through before. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Do you have a sec? Yeah, yeah. The guy you got in there, Donny, um, he asked me out the other night and I'm pretty sure he slipped me a roofie. - Um... - Okay. Everything was fine and then, uh, then I just kinda blacked out. I've got really hazy memories. It keeps coming back and forth. Mary Lynne. Sweet. Internships. Shit. The body, where is it? You won't find it. The spirit is within it now. What does that mean? What are you trying to say? The intruder came here, and stole everything he could from us, our language, our stories, our songs, and worst of all the land. This land is what we are, and without it, we are no more. And right now strangers want to devour, steal it from right under us as we speak. Mary Lynne, do you understand? There are people dying out there, innocent people, our people too. If you can help us, th- Where is Kharis? Kharis is dead. She was killed on a road late one night by some beast who dragged her a hundred feet, cared less about her than a scrap of roadkill. What the hell you make of that? Your guess is as good as mine. We have to stop this. Hey, Bet. How was the case? I'm asking myself the same question. I just wanted to let you know that I'll be heading out to the community center. So I may not be here when you get back. That's a good distance. How are you getting there? My bike. You sure? It's pretty cool out. My warrior spirit can handle it. A warrior on a bicycle. At least until I get my Harley, anyway. And guess what? That's on you. Ben. Actually, I don't want you going out alone until this is settled. Okay? But, this is important to me. Ben. Long time ago, we were teenagers too, remember? I never was. So what now? I don't know. Kharis, or whatever the hell that thing is out there, it's hunting. So, we gotta go hunt the hunter. Man, I wish Carson was here with us. Yeah, I wish he was too. You out for bear now? No, a poacher set it. Get the gallbladder's out to China, leave the rest of the animal to rot. These things cost money. I hope whoever set it cries. You go ahead. I'm going to go check on Ben. Hey Mary Lynne, I need to talk to you. This belonged to my friend, Jocko Deer, he was Mohawk from Kahnawake. We served together. He used to say to me, "what are you doing over here? "Shooting at people that never did anything to you "10,000 miles from your nice little Rez." But, we'd laugh because we both knew why we were there. The kind of thing that goes so deep it's hard to explain, even to yourself. What's your point? One night before a mission he said to me, "I'm tired of fighting." And I said, "yeah, we all are." But he said, "no, not this kind of fighting." He was tired of fighting the past. Of everything we lost, everything that was done to us. It's always there, but you got to move on or you won't get anywhere. So he made a plan for himself. He was gonna join his father on his uncles on the high steel. Nobody wanted to build... bridges. "Bridges connect people", he said. Everyone pays the same toll. You get off, and you got no choice. You're in someone else's territory, all of a sudden, and you got to deal with them. Without the bridge you're both screwed. So, we're all in this together. "That'll be my contribution", he said. Did he? No, he didn't make it. I've been hanging on to this for eight years. But uh, it's time to move on. It's my gift to you. Ben, when I said, stay home, I meant it. WEC is hiring, paid summer internships. Even if you're 14. I called around and there's only 20 spots. And if I don't go today, then I don't get one. Just stay away from anything WEC. We'll figure something else out, okay? You know something? You're always telling me to be more responsible to take initiative, eyes on the prize, make something of myself, and now that I'm... Ben. Ben, are you okay? What happened? I thought I saw something. What? A-a-auntie, I'm feeling scared. How far are you from home? I barely left. Okay, you peddle like the devil get inside and locked the door. I'm not too far. Shit. Oh. Stace? Jesus. Inside. She's trying to get in. I'm almost there. Get down to the cellar, barricade yourself. Auntie, I'm bleeding. Can you run? I think so. Get down to the cellar. Ben! I'm down here. Hey, I'm here. You see her? She's inside. Ben's hurt. We're in the cellar. Put your foot up here. It's gonna be okay. Betty! She's trying to break down the door. My last clip's almost empty. She's almost in! Hey Kharis, check it out. I work for WEC now. Scarden! Kharis, come on! Come at me. Fuckin' hell. What do we do with her? I don't know. - Drag her to death? - Again? I don't know. Betty! Betty. No, she's here for you. Go! The head. The head. Is it over? Almost. You're hurt. Accident. Fell off a ladder. That's life. Yeah, life. You? Just, uh, visiting. I was playing on thin ice, fell through. We can say its name one more time, and never again. Your prisoner in the back there seems like he needs some medical attention. He took a tumble getting in the cruiser. He actually did double duty tonight, had him solve another charge. He's the hit and run, killed Kharis. - What led you... - Frances from the diner. She gave him up. She was with him. She was in the truck. He slipped her a date rape drug. She was pretty unconscious, but then fragments started coming back, trucks starting, stopping and hitting something. We had a little chat. He, uh, volunteered some more info. What the hell is that smell?
