GENE: Jesse Ventura, I've seen some outlandish outfits before but this one takes the cake. JESSE: Mean Gene, how dare you criticize how I dress? I dress for the occasion. And this is a stupendous occasion and I'm dressed, of course, stupendously. GENE: Stupendously I think would have to be the word. Jesse, this one has gotta be the hottest ticket in town. This thing has been sold out for weeks. ANNOUNCER: Now in the ring, the challenger: Jake Bullet. GENE: Jesse, when the champ comes in, watch this place come unglued. ANNOUNCER: And his opponent, the World Wrestling Federation heavyweight champion: Rip! [GROWLING] [ALL CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] [GROWLING] [в™Є] Rip him! Rip him! Rip him! Come on, Randy. Let's go, Charlie. We're gonna rip Jake Bullet, man. We're gonna rip him up, man. Yeah. Let's go. Come on, Charlie, rip him. We're gonna get you, Jake Bullet. Jake Bullet. GENE: There's always been a special relationship between Rip and Randy. But ever since the unfortunate loss of their parents, Rip has been more, much more, than a brother to Randy. Hello again, everybody. This is Mean Gene Okerlund, along with my broadcast colleague, Jesse "The Body" Ventura. This week, the World Wrestling Federation heavyweight champion Rip to defend against the man you consider to be a strong challenger in Jake Bullet. JESSE: Jake Bullet is the number one contender for the championship, Mean Gene. He's waited a long time for this matchup. And people have said that Rip has ducked him. That Rip has done everything to avoid this showdown. GENE: Those comments are just as outlandish as that hairdo you're sporting, Jesse. Nonetheless, Jake Bullet, a formidable opponent. JESSE: Formidable opponent? He's the number one contender for Rip's title. [GRUNTING] JESSE: There you see Rip doing the classic Rip psych job. Psyching him up for this matchup, Mean Gene. There it is, the "rip him" sign. [ALL CHEERING AND SHOUTING] GENE: These fans are in a frenzy. Bullet charging. Rip sidesteps into the turnbuckle, whoa. Beautiful hip swipe by Rip. JESSE: And Rip's got the only advantage here in the bout. Into the turnbuckle with-- Oh, and Bullet caught him with a big elbow. Ha-ha! And Rip is down. MAN: Rip, go back. Come on, Rip. [CROWD BOOING] Rip, behind you! [GRUNTING] Looks like our competition might do us a favor and self-destruct. JESSE [ON TV]: Rip in the center of the ring, Rip is going down. This could be the change of the championship right here. Rip has nowhere to go. Jake Bullet sinks in that sleeper hold, man. The arm going up and down, Gene. MAN: Come on. GENE: It appears we're just moments away from crowning a new champ. Nobody has ever escaped this ominous hold. JESSE: Jake Bullet applying even more pressure on the champion. CROWD: Rip! Rip! Rip! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! CROWD: Rip! Rip! Rip! [BOTH GRUNTING] JESSE: He's back to his feet. I don't believe it. Bullet struggling to maintain that sleeper hold. Takes one elbow. Takes a second elbow. A third elbow. But Jake Bullet is still holding on. Whoa, he's broken the sleeper hold. GENE: What a maneuver. Ha! MAN: All right, Ripper! JESSE: Rip is standing tall, apparently feeling no effects from that sleeper hold applied by Jake Bullet. Bullet fires a big forearm. A second forearm. They're having no effect on Rip. CROWD: One! Two! Three! Four! Five! JESSE: Rip firing Jake into the ropes. Oh, he catches him with the big foot. The big foot. And amazingly, Jake Bullet is still standing after that. Rip, slides into the ropes. Oh, he caught him with a double axe hammer. REFEREE: Two! Three! Okay! Ripper! Ripper! I can't believe it, Mean Gene, he's did it again. GENE: We've got pandemonium. These people are crazy. They're wild... MAN: Pandemonium. Crazy. JESSE: The double axe hammer did it. Wild. I guess there'll be no thunderous celebration here, huh? Not when you're last in the ratings. Again! I want that jockass on this network. Ten o'clock. Tomorrow. Boardroom. Talk to me. And still World Wrestling Federation heavyweight champion: Rip! GENE: Now the celebration begins! [CROWD SCREAMING AND CHEERING] GENE: Look at the size of those guns, 24 inches round. JESSE: One day, one day somebody's gonna beat this guy. Way to go, big brother! GENE: There he is, younger brother, Randy. Big part of it all, Charlie, the trainer. They're all celebrating. JESSE: Yeah. Even I'm a little bit amazed. I didn't think Rip would dispose of Jake Bullet quite so quickly. GENE: There he is, in all his majesty, still World Wrestling Federation heavyweight champion: Rip! I refuse to grow old waiting for Rip to ride off into the sunset. When I took over this network some months ago I vowed to take it to the top. Now I find that every time this jockass decides to strip down to his sweet nothings and wallow around with some sweat hog we eat it. So... Ms. Tidings, you survived my little purge. Reward my faith in you. [CLEARS THROAT] I have taken the liberty of asking a writer to work up a high-concept sitcom-- Next. Miss Tidings, take a leak. [GASPS] [TIDINGS SOBBING] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] What about you, Ordway? Uh... Could you see another prime time game show? They sell. Sell? Sell? Sell? This sells. This is what people want. This is what I want. Now, which one of you is going to go out and get it for me? Look, Rip is already under contract to another network, Mr. Brell. Tell me something I don't already know, Johnston. Contracts are nothing but words. But, ahem, Mr. Brell, I'm told that Rip's word is his bond. Bond? Then we get him to break his bond! What's his price? That's what I wanna know. What's his price? With, uh, all due respect, Mr. Brell, others have asked that question. You listen to me, wise guy, and every last one of you. Spare me your mealy mouth "with all due respect" crap. What this network needs, this network gets. I promise you that. Even Rip has his price. Thanks for the lift. WOMAN: Hello, Rip. How you doing? MAN: Hey, champ, how you doing? I hope the muscle guy doesn't break one of these. Rip, what a pleasure to meet you. So glad you could come by. Thanks, Jane. Mr. Brell. Your last match, a masterpiece. Loved it. Loved it. Thanks, Mr. Brell. Sit down. Relax. You like the chair? Crafted for men of great stature. Louis XIV. Cost me a fortune. Heh. [CHAIR CREAKS] Louis would have been so pleased. You want some fruit juice or something? Guys, fruit juice or something. No, thanks. Let me-- Well, then let me get right to the point, big guy. I want you to come work for me. I know. I know you've got a contract, but hear me out. Here's what I'm proposing. I want you on my network. And I'm willing to pay whatever it takes. RIP: Thanks, Mr. Brell, but I'm not interested. [CHUCKLES] I'm not through yet. Don't think I don't know what you're doing. It's blank. Just fill in the amount. [SCOFFS] Hey, where are you going? I'm leaving, Mr. Brell. Wait a minute. I said wait a minute. You're not going anywhere until you and I come to an agreement. Watch me. Are you trying to tell me my money's not good enough? I find that a little hard to swallow, you jockass! [в™Є] [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] [CHUCKLES] [ALL CHUCKLING] Oh, my God! I won't be around when this check clears. [GRUNTING] [BRELL COUGHING] Get me the garage. You'll show him, Mr. Brell. Yeah, this ought to be good. [в™Є] Hey, pal, you should've gone right back there. You're going the wrong way. Hey! Wait a minute, you're not-- Try this one for size. Jeez. [GRUNTING] Whoa! [HORN HONKS] Whoa! MAN: You moron! Oh! Oh! DRIVER: Whoa! [в™Є] Hey! Whoa! [ALL CHATTERING] [SIGHS] MAN: What's going on?

Pleased to meet you. Sam? Nice to meet you. My pleasure, Rip. Ladies, gentlemen, shall we? Feel free to look at the briefs in front of you. Item one: merchandising. Mr. Reynolds and I agree that an obvious opportunity overlooked is the sportswear market. It's a natural for Rip. WOMAN: Miss Moore-- I invite comments at the end. Thank you. For now, please let's continue. Item two: personal appearances. [SIGHS] They should be better synchronized with Rip's title matches. Item three: television exposure. Now, our research shows that Rip has a huge TV cue. We should take full advantage of it. Rip, we'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Pardon me? We were speaking about your image, the Rip character. I'd be very interested in your thoughts on this. Miss Moore, the Rip character wants me to tell you that his main outside interest is his charity work. He says maybe you could put that in your brief. I don't mean to be rude. But can we talk about it later? Fine. I'll pick you up. Eight o'clock. Dinner. Dressy. [в™Є] [PATRONS CHATTERING] WAITER: Is everything all right? MAN: Yes, it is. [BOTH SPEAK IN FRENCH] MAN: That's him. WOMAN: Rip. That's him. Thank you. I didn't know if you'd like a place like this. I hope there's something on the menu that you like. [SPEAKS IN FRENCH] May I recite the specialty, monsieur? [SAMANTHA SPEAKS IN FRENCH] [SPEAKS IN FRENCH] [WAITER SHOOING] [WAITER SPEAKING IN FRENCH] I recommend le quiche. That's, uh, cheese pie with, uh, snails to you. No, I don't think that he would. WAITER: No, no, no. But I'm afraid monsieur is looking for le hamburger Americano, le foot-long hotdog. He will not find them on our menu. [GULPS] Rip, why don't you try the beef bourguignon? It's like stew. [CHEF SPEAKING IN FRENCH] Antoinne, you naughty boy. You should have said our friend is here. Monsieur le who? CHEF: Antoinne is new. You must forgive him. [INHALES] Monsieur le Rip, the usual? [RIP SPEAKING IN FRENCH] [CHUCKLES] [SNAPS FINGERS] [BOTH GRUNTING] Go ahead. How many? Thanks.

Last one standing wins. Just don't kill nobody. Them's the only rules. Those are my kind of rules. [YELLS] Who's next? You! I love it. Six bucks. Oh. What credit cards do you take? Cash and only cash. And if you ain't got it, my brother over there will rip your lips off. [LAUGHING] [WHIMPERS] Tell your brother that he can keep the change if he takes on that guy in the ring. [GRUNTING] Go get him, Bubba. [GRUNTING] Rock 'n' roll, buddy. WAITRESS: Show him your cage, Bubba. Kill him! Move, move! Kill him! Get him! [CHUCKLES] MAN 1: Kill him! Go, go!

That's the beauty of it. This could be just what I've been looking for. [YELLING] Pardon me, Mr. Brell, but I have to go to the bathroom. MAN: Hey, guys. [CHUCKLING] Me too. MAN: Hurry back. Don't step, don't step. Where's the bathroom? Ask somebody. Ask somebody. Excuse me, pal, but, uh, where do I go to bleed the old lizard? In your pants, wimp. Bleed the old lizard? Well, it sounded good. [YELLING] [MAN BURPS] God, they're everywhere. Please. MAN: Hey, watch where you're going. Don't touch anything. You don't have to worry. [GASPS] Oh, my God. Do you have to go? I forgot to go before. Unh. [DOG SNARLS] [BARKING] [TOILET FLUSHES] What are you looking at? My God, I can't believe Brell's serious. These are the stupidest, crudest, most subhuman beings I have ever encountered. And those waitresses, they ought to be in body bags, not wet T-shirts. Ha, ha. Would these idiots even know the difference? Heh. "Great color," Brell says. Yeah, if you like slime green. [BOTH CHUCKLING] How about pus yellow? [FARTING NOISE] What the hell was that? Oh, God. [TOILET FLUSHES] [YELLING] Oh, no. Who are you calling an idiot, you maggot? Certainly not you. We meant the other idiots. Yeah. I mean, the gentlemen. No, no, don't, please. BUBBA: Wow. Wow. What do we got here? A teeny wang. And here's another. It ain't even worth it. [LAUGHING] Never in a million years will Brell get this on the air.

So if you think you're tough enough, come on down and put it on the line. We are entering a new era in sports television. MAN: Hey, Joey, I need the adapter. Nice. UNGER: Nice. ORDWAY: Nice.

This is that Battle of the Tough Guys competition they've been talking about. MAN [ON TV]: Brock Chisler is being man-handled. What do you think, Rip? You can take this guy. Come on, are you crazy? Look at this guy. This guy is a monster. --gladiators. [GASPS] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] I'm gonna knock your block off! Bubba! Bubba! [GRUNTING] Serves him right! This man is heartless. What you are witnessing... Isn't that--? I never thought they'd let him out. Wait a minute, you know this guy? Yeah, but I'm not proud of it. Way back, I was his trainer for a while. But I just couldn't control him. So I had to let him go. And then I heard he killed some kid in the ring after the bell. Anyway, he got sent up for a long time. BRELL: Never in the history of sport have I seen such incredible competition. [GRUNTING] WOMAN: Come on, Bubba. Get up. [GRUNTS] WOMAN: Oh, no. Oh, God. [SCREAMING] [BOTH CHUCKLE] Oh, my God. Mr. Brell, don't. Mr.-- The winner and $100,000 richer, the champion of The Battle of the Tough Guys is... What was the name? [WHISPERS] Zeus. Love it. [MAN CLEARS THROAT] [DOOR OPENS] The overnights are in. We're number one in our time slot. And just like Zeus, we kicked some ass. [ALL CHEER] Thank you. These, ahem, telegrams came in to our PR Department last night. I'm afraid we have a very serious problem here. "My son had violent nightmares "after watching your grotesque show. It is my intention to organize a nationwide coalition." They watched it, didn't they? That's all that's counts. Let them talk. Let them complain. Let them shout it to the heavens. All it does is keep us in the headlines. The World Television Network presents: The Battle of the Tough Guys: Week Two. Tonight, the challenger is: Lugwrench Perkins. Yeah!

Just as long as your office didn't make dinner reservations because I know just the spot. Thank you. I can't believe how long it's been since you've been in town last. Thank you. Oh, me and Ripper go way back. Of course, that was when I was a size nine. Honey, you couldn't ask for a greater guy. He's an original, all right. Sadie, you're still a whole lot of woman. SADIE: Oh, stop that, boy. You always say that. You know, baby cakes, now, if I wasn't married, whoo-ee! Turn me loose. And you couldn't run fast enough.

[SAMANTHA GROANS] RIP: You don't need this. You build bigger walls than I ever could. Where are you going? There's a couch in the lobby that has a better sense of humor than you do. God save me from conniving females and cretinous jocks. SAMANTHA: Conniving? You're the one who canceled the room from under me. You got it. Because the difference between me and you, lady, is that I can and you can't. You just can't. When I asked you to seduce him, you just couldn't. Now that you've got the hots for him, you just can't. You just can't do me one lousy favor. I gave your agency more business than they've ever had. And for this, I get a phone call in the middle of the night saying: "Gee, Mr. Brell, I--" He's really a nice guy. I eat nice guys for breakfast. Not with my help, you don't. [GRUNTS] [GROANS] [BOTH GASP] BRELL: Get back here. You owe me! [в™Є] RIP: Sam, are you okay? Sam? SAMANTHA: I'm so ashamed. [SAMANTHA CRYING] SAMANTHA: Brell is an evil man. I'm worse because I know better. I let him use me. Did Brell do this? Just let it go. Just let it go, please. I just want you to forgive me. [CRYING] I forgive you, Sam. But the hotel is sending you a bill for breaking the bed. [BOTH LAUGHING] RIP: God, you're easy. You. I can't believe you. Hey. Hey, I come crying my eyes out to you, pouring my heart out, and you make a big, big joke about it. I'll fight back. Hey, wait a minute, you big lug. I hope it breaks. No, you don't. Oh, God. [SAMANTHA SCREAMS THEN GIGGLES] No. Not an arm lock. Not an arm lock. How about lip-lock? What are you doing? Well, I find that you're doing it yourself. CARY [ON TV]: Welcome to this week's edition of Sports Talk. I have the pleasure of introducing to you a world champion. A champion in a sport in which there are no rules.

These punks have tried to hurt Mr. Brell. Brell. BRELL: I'm fine. Don't touch me. Hey. Come on. It's an accident. Damn it, you kids. Let go of them. Well, what do we have here? Zeus converting a Rip fan. That's great. That's what I like to see. We'll convert them all, heh. Hey, we are not Zeus fans. Yeah, that's right. Rip's his brother. So Rip's brother. My, my, what an honor. Isn't it an honor, guys? Yes, sir. Well, that makes you boys practically VIPs. Zeus loves VIPs, doesn't he, guys? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Bring them. CRAIG: All right, lighten up.

Seeing as you're Rip's little brother, I bet you handle yourself pretty good, huh? What do you think, Zeus? Your brother's yellow. And I'm gonna kill him. All right, Randy.

He's waiting for you. [ZEUS CACKLING ON TV] Zeus! [ZEUS CACKLING ON TV] BRELL: Rip said the worms are too good for you. Sort of like an Easter egg hunt, isn't it, Rip? I want him, Brell! BRELL: Only on my terms. [UNGER AND BRELL LAUGHING] Mr. Brell, it's a privilege to watch genius at work. A privilege and a thrill. BRELL: Thank you. UNGER: This is the best ringside seat.

Rip said-- [BRELL LAUGHING OVER SPEAKERS] ORDWAY: I've seen temper tantrums before, but this is really something special. [GRUNTS] [ALL GASP] [CHUCKLES] [в™Є] Hey, little brother, it's me. I know you stood up to Zeus. I'm damn proud of you. But now it's my turn. Hey. Charlie. Randy. Oh, Randy. Oh.

[GRUNTING] You can do it. Come on, Randy. Come on. Get both feet underneath you. Come on. Mr. Brell, we salute you for a brilliant idea brilliantly realized. Brilliant. Of course. But what if Rip wins? No more tough guy. Mr. Greene, Rip will not win this fight. Trust me. Ordway. Unger. Satellite backup's on standby? Yes, sir. And the elevator? And the elevator. Good.

Couple of guards grabbed Samantha. Grabbed her in the elevator. What? [PHONE RINGING] CRAIG: They're WTN guys. Hello. It's Brell. Get me Rip. I'm listening. Make it look good for 10 minutes. Then you go down. And you stay down. Or you'll be pushing matching wheelchairs. Get the picture? [CHUCKLES] You've got 10 minutes to find her. Move. I'm out of here. I'm with you, Charlie. MAN: The referee is checking the ropes and turnbuckles now. But as soon as the fight starts, he will leave the ring. For his only duty will be to stop the fight and to declare the winner.
