[tenor saxophone music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [dramatic music] [gunshot] No! [door flapping] [sighs] [sighs] Bonjour, monsieur. 'Monsieur.' [speaking in foreign language] Bon app√©tit, monsieur. How is Monsieur Georges, today? Oh, he seem to have had a restful night, madame. 'Did Carter say what time he'll be back?' No, madame, but the train from Paris arrive at half past eight. [train hooting] [piano music] [music continues] [piano music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] - The car has returned, madame. - Oh, thank you. Hello. My dear, how nice to see you again. - Oh, Mrs. Ryman. - How was your journey? Fabulous. Can't begin to tell you about it. I hope you'll be very happy here with us. Carter, take all mademoiselle's luggage up to her room. How about a swim and a rest before lunch? Oh, this is all the luggage, the young lady has, madame. Oh. But you got my trunk? We haven't got it, my dear. You must've. I sent it over two weeks ago. Never mind. It'll turn up sooner or later. Now, come and let me show your room. 'You like it?' Oh, it's beautiful. The whole place is beautiful. You must love it here. Yes, I do. The happiest times of my life have been spent here. After we married, we came here, every summer until my husband died. I've lived here ever since. Nothing's been changed. Nothing ever will be changed. You know, there're times, many times.. ...when I feel my husband's still here. I hear his voice, his footsteps and his music. Always this place is full of his music. But you don't wanna listen to the ramblings of a sentimental old woman. I understand, Mrs. Ryman. Call me Danielle. Please. Alright. I know, we'll get on splendidly together. I can't wait to start working. Oh, there'll be plenty of time for that. You're a very pretty girl, my dear. Well, I expect you know that already. You've got lovely hair. You-you shouldn't pull it back from a face like that. Uh! Now, you're bathroom is over there. An-and don't worry about your trunk. I'll get Carter to make some enquiries at the station. In the meantime, I-I'll find you some things to wear. Danielle. Thank you for everything. Nonsense, my dear. It's you who are doing us the favor. [whispers] Just by being here. [door closes] [knocking on the door] Come in. Hello. My name is Susan Roberts. What's yours? Lillianne. Do you work here all the time? I live here. Oh! Well then, we'll be seeing quite a bit of each other. I'm here to do thesis on Henry Ryman. What is thesis? Well, it's a, it's a study on his life and his work. Sort of a biography. It's for my master's degree in music. 'You're a musician?' No, not really. But I'm studying the classical composers and uh.. ...Henry Ryman was one of America's finest. 'I know.' 'Madame never stops telling everyone.' 'Everyone who listen.' Of course, she would. She'll be proud to have been married to such a marvelous man. [scoffs] Yes, she's proud. Now, is there anything else, I must get on with my work? Oh. No, thank you. [door closes] [piano music] Ow. (Susan) 'Ow.' (Danielle) 'This is my son, Georges.' 'Georges, this is Susan Roberts.' Hello, Susan. Hello, Georges. - 'Welcome to Le Bourg.' - Thank you. Well, you're a long way from New York. 'That's where you're from, isn't it?' Yes. You, uh, live there? With your parents? No, my-my parents died in an automobile accident six years ago. I lived with my aunt. She must've been very sorry to see you go. She died last year. So, you see, I'm all alone. Not as long as you are in this house, my dear. Thank you. Oh. I can't hardly believe, all this is happening to me. I've been so excited since Mrs. Ryman.. ...I mean Danielle invited me here. You never did tell me how you met Ms. Roberts, mother. It was at your father's commemorative concert for his scholarship fund. Susan was one of this year's successful applicants. It was at the university garden party. And then afterwards, when your mother was kind enough to invite me here for summer to examine some of your father's manuscripts and letters. Well, how could I refuse? So.. - Here you are. - Yeah. Here I am. Luncheon's served, madame. Oh, thank you, Carter. Come and sit down. (Danielle) Now, would you like to sit there, Susan? (Danielle) 'There we are.' I heard you playing the piano this morning. The unfinished concerto. It's lovely. It's to my mother's everlasting regret that the musical genius of my father was not passed on to me. In spite of years spent with the best teachers in the world. But I thought the playing was quite-- Amateurish. Right, mother? Would you like some more coffee? Oh, thank you. - Excuse me, madame. - What is it, Carter? The estate manager would like a word with you. If possible. Oh, yes. If you'll excuse me. How's your shoulder? How did you know about that? I was watching you this morning. That's my room. Oh, I see. Oh, it's fine. 'Thank you.' You probably pulled a muscle. I'll look at it later, if you like. Alright, doctor. Well, I expect you'd like to get on with your work. Oh, there's so much atmosphere here. I hardly know where to begin. I think, you're gonna manage perfectly. Now, if you'll excuse me. I always take a rest after lunch. Hmm. [birds chirping] [water lashing] [door squeaking] [keying piano] [typewriter clacking] Dinner will be at 7:30. Alright. Madame said, she'd like to see you in her room before you go down. Ah-ha. How long are you staying here? I don't know. Why? I just wanted to know. Oh, you look charming, my dear. (Susan) 'Oh, thank you.' Uh, Lillianne said you wanted to see me. Oh, yes. I wanted to give you these. The letters exchanged between my husband and his publisher. I think, you'll find them interesting. Oh, I'm sure, I will. Thank you very much. Uh. - Danielle. - Yes. If you don't mind me asking.. What happened to Georges? It was a tragic accident, six years ago. More tragic because he was an athlete before. A fine tennis player. In a year or two, he could have made his mark at Wimbledon. If he'd been a brilliant musician like his father it wouldn't have mattered so much. No, that's not being callous, because you see a career could have given him an interest in life. All our family have been musical. My husband's brother was a virtuoso violinist. And my own brother was professor at the Konservatuar. And his son, m-my nephew he's organist at Durham Cathedral. Then my father, he was a close friend of Sibelius. And he has a remarkable singing voice. And my mother's brother.. Oh, but I must be boring you with all my family history. Oh, no. It's fascinating. Georges doesn't find it so. Do you, my darling? They're my family too, mother. I've heard it all before. Tell me, how long did you study music? 12 years. But almost everything interfered with my studies. Oh, girls and tennis. - 'Oh, I'm sorry.' - Oh, no, no. That's alright. Well, what about you? Oh, fortunately, my aunt loved music. She bullied me into that piano lessons. And you needed bullying. Oh well, yes at first. Then, it was the other way round. When I was about 17, I was forced to admit that I'd never be good enough for the concert platform. So, I decided to teach instead. 'This thesis is for my master's degree.' How long will it take? A month, six weeks, if that's alright. My dear, you may stay as long as you like. I, for one will be disappointed if you decide to leave. - If? - When. And I'm sure Georges will be too. Won't you, my darling? Oh yes, of course. There's a mess of books, things about my husband over there. Help yourself when you want to. If you have any trouble with the French ones Georges will translate for you. Uh, Danielle, that place across from the pool, the music room 'is that where your husband worked?' Yes, it is. Mother's personal shrine to father. No one's allowed in there. Right, mother? (Danielle) 'Nonsense, my dear. You don't dramatize it.' Susan's welcome to see the music room whenever she wants to. And now, if you'll excuse me. Why don't you play her some of your father's early recordings? Goodnight, my dear. Goodnight. Well. What? - Shall we have some music? - Oh, yes, of course. - How about the Second Symphony? - That's one of my favorites. The manuscripts are over there, if you want to follow the scar. - Here it is. - Thank you. [instrumental music] Said, I'd look at your shoulder. - Hmm? - 'Shoulder.' Oh, it's fine. Thank you. (Susan) Such a silly thing to do. Better let me take a look at it. Remember, I'm an expert. I used to pull my shoulder at least three times a year when I was on the tennis circuits. Oh. And where is it? Ouch. Oh. Oh, yeah, here I have got it. Doctor prescribes a massage. - Hm. - I'm not hurting you, am I ? No, it's marvelous. There, it should be easier in the morning. Oh, that was so soon. Hm-mm. What were you gonna say? Nothing. Come on, there shouldn't be any secrets between doctor and patient. Alright, I was just gonna ask you about your accident. Life is a series of accidents, some lucky some.. For me, it's enough that I'm alive. There's more to life than just existing. Oh, a philosopher as well as a musician. No. Is there something wrong? No, it's just that you remind me of someone. Who? Just an old friend. - 'Oh, here, let me.' - Oh, it's alright. I can do it. I'm sure you can. I'd like to do it, though. Alright. You say when. When. - Cheers. - You are not gonna have any? No, I don't feel like one right now. [glass shattering] Georges. Georges, what's wrong? The bell over by that fire place, ring it. Bell, oh. Georges, is there anything I can do? No, it's my legs. Sometimes, they.. Lillianne, where's Lillianne? I'm here. You rang, mademoiselle? Lillianne, please. You need me, sir? Get over here. (Lillianne) 'You must remember, my darling.' It is I who you need. It is me who helps you. 'It is me who makes you..' ...forget. I'm the one you need. All...the time. 'Remember that, my love.' [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [tenor saxophone music] [speaking in foreign language] [music continues] [speaking in foreign language] [music continues] [eerie music] [saxophone music [music continues] [music continues] [dramatic music] [gunshot] I'm sorry, miss. I thought you were in bed. [chuckles] Oh, that's quite alright, my good man. You can go to bed now. 'What the hell are you doing?' Practicing. Practicing? What is that supposed to mean? For future role. As mistress of this house. What are you laughing at? Don't you think I fit the part? He does. You don't think I'm good enough? You're a slut. You'll end up in the gutter where you came from. Argh! [gasping] It's stupid of us to quarrel. Ooh, we should be friends. You...and I. You keep madame happy. I'll take care of him. You're still a slut. [chuckles] Don't be. The world has changed, Monsieur Carter. [both chuckle] But you haven't noticed, have you? Is that what comes from spending most of your time in asylums? Hm-mm. [dramatic music] [grunting] Good morning, my dear. Good morning, Danielle. That bikini fits you perfectly. Yes, it's quite remarkable, isn't it? Whose clothes were they? Just a girl who used to live here. Uh, Danielle, by any chance.. ..is this her? 'Yes, it was.' - Tell me about her. - Is this for your thesis? No. It's just that Georges said I remind him of somebody. I was just curious it was her. Possibly, you're not unlike her. That was before the accident? Yes, it was. - And then, she left him? - Yes, she did. How terrible. What was her name? Catherine. And he loved her very much? He loved her too much, I'm afraid. Now, I'm going to take a swim. Pour me whisky, Carter. Certainly, sir. You're looking tired, Monsieur Georges. The ladies are coming, sir. Ah, here we are. Good evening, Georges. [dramatic music] (Susan) 'Georges, what's the matter?' - Have I done something wrong? - I don't know, my dear. Go to him and see if there's anything you can do. Georges. May I come in, Georges? Could I talk to you for a minute? [dramatic music] Ow! Georges. Susan, forgive me. It was Catherine's, wasn't it? Your mother told me all about her. What did she tell you? Well, that you, you were very much in love with her and.. ...she left you after the accident. I remind you of her, don't I ? Yes. Should I leave you alone? Please. - I'll-I'll say, goodnight. - Susan. Keep the pendant. It looks fine on you. Ah, there you are, my dear. Is he alright, now? Danielle, why are you doing this? Doing what? Trying to make me into Catherine. Oh, nonsense, my dear. You've no clothes here and there's lots of Catherine's lying here. It's as simple as that. But what about this? Jewellery as beautiful as that should be worn. Come, lets go and have dinner. Oh, ah, if-if you'll please excuse me tonight, Danielle. I'm not very hungry. And I thought maybe I'd just go upstairs and have a.. Do a little work. 'Very well, my dear.' - 'Goodnight.' - 'Goodnight.' Madame told me to bring this to you. (Lillianne) 'She said, it would help you sleep.' What is it? 'A chocolate, she made it herself.' Well, could you put it beside the bed, please. Everything is ready, madame. Oh, thank you, Carter. There you are, my darling. I've been waiting for you. Now, what are we going to have tonight? The conjeitor? Dumb. [piano music] [music continues] [music continues] The fog's lifted. You can see the lights. Dubois was here today asking when the conjeitor would be finished. That's right, my darling. That's right. Strong the Gamet records.. ...leading into the appassionato. [piano music] [music continues] No! No, that's not right! [man screaming] [dramatic music] I'm sorry if I startled you, miss. Oh, God. Carter, come here, I wanna show you something. - What's happened? - 'Just come with me.' There in the chair. Hello, my dear. I thought you were in bed. 'Thank you, Carter.' Goodnight, miss. Madame. What've you done with the dummy? You shouldn't walk around like that, my dear. You'll catch cold. Who was playing the piano? Oh, I'm sorry did it disturb you? I often come here, I sit alone, I.. listen to my ...husbands music. Yes, I heard it. Who was the pianist? My husband. [piano music] (Georges) 'You've been very quite all day?' 'Is there anything wrong?' Something strange happened last night. What? Well, I don't know, it's-it's.. ...quite difficult to explain. Tell me. I was-I was upstairs sleeping and I heard this music coming from the music room. Then she turned on the tape recorder and I felt like a complete idiot. But I know what I saw, Georges, I know it. Susan, I want you to do something for me. I want you to leave, but don't let my mother know that I've asked you to leave. Do you understand? - No. - She wants you to stay. And she'd be angry if she knew that I asked you to leave. And when she's angry, she's a very different person. 'She has a-a certain influence over me' 'which I can't begin to explain.' She'll make me try to convince you to stay, but you must leave even though I beg you to stay. This influence over you, is it related to your accident? She.. ...could make life impossible for me. Well then, why don't you leave too? [speaking in a foreign language] I've been dancing. What have you been doing? - Your drunk. - Oh, no-no, not drunk. Just inebriated. I think, you'd better go to your room. Oh, pardon, monsieur. I was forgetting my place. 'I was allowed today.' I have a friend, now. - We're not interested. - You should be. He's given me something. Something for you. A little...present. When? Whenever you like. It's late, Susan, I think, I'll go to my room. 'I'll help you, monsieur.' Susan. I meant what I said. Goodnight. That all looked very cozy out there. How much did you get? Holding hands. Very cozy. - How much-- - Enough. But we must have a talk. We must get something settled. Your life. - Lillianne, please. - No! Business first. Alright. What do you want? - How long is that girl staying? - I've asked her to leave. Good boy. That's the first thing. Now.. ...we come to the main point. You and me. Anything you like. This is not a game, darling. This time.. ...I'm serious. You're going to marry me. - Marry? - Marry. You don't know what you're talking. Yes, I do. Because the price for this, has gone up. It's a dangerous game, my sweet. It makes no difference whether I steal it from your mother.. ...or I buy it in town. It's still dangerous. 'And if I got caught' 'who then would give you your extra little night cap?' You little whore. Get out! But you don't want me to go, do you? Because I come to your room. To give you nice dreams and to excite you a little. When no other women would bother. Not even a-- Witch. Perhaps, I will tell our visitor things about the Ryman family. - Yes, maybe, I will. - Be careful, Lillianne. Be careful. You are so big and strong, monsieur. I am so afraid of you. Don't hurt me. Don't punish me. Don't. Please. Will you not massage me instead, my lord. Look. Look at me. Take your jacket off. Are you strong enough? Or shall I help you? Help me. Well.. Get on with it for God's sake. Not until you have promised to marry me. I'll do it myself then. No. That was a stupid thing to do. I shall not come to your room again. Until you have promised to marry me. It's a pity. 'Cause, I quite enjoy my visits. I'm hot now. I shall go for a swim. You're going to watch me. I know, it excites you. You can even think about oiling me after. Sweet dreams, my love. [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] [bell ringing] [engine revving] [ringing continues] [honking] [train chugging] I went to the station they said they delivered the trunk to the house two weeks ago. 'I saw the slip.' Yes, dear, I know, I'm so glad. It's up in your room now. Where has it been? I found it this morning in Lillianne's room. I dismissed her immediately of course. - You dismissed her? - 'Well, obviously.' 'She obviously meant to steal it.' I see. Have you seen Georges this morning? - 'No, why?' - Oh, do go and see him. He does so enjoy having you here. Why do you say that? Why, he's so much better since you arrived. He's more cheerful, hopeful if you like. I-I don't think so, Danielle. I think my being here upsets him. Did he tell you that? No, I just feel it. Danielle, I-I think maybe I'm gonna leave. Leave? What on earth for? Well, because I-I think it would be better for everybody. Well, not as far as Georges and I are concerned. W-well then, for me. 'And what about your work?' I'm sure we'll be able to persuade you to change your mind. No, you won't. - Have you told Georges? - I was just going to tell him. But you can't leave. But yesterday you said I should. Forget all that. Please, don't go. I-I don't understand. Your mother said that Lillianne's gone. 'I know.' - What is it? - The swimming pool. 'What about it?' (Susan) 'It's been emptied.' Oh, well, we clean it out every couple of weeks. Lillianne's the reason, isn't she? What? That you've changed your mind about my going. Her not being here anymore. Listen, Georges, I don't pretend to know what's going on but you were somehow dependant on her, weren't you? In some things. Same sort of things I could do for you? Yes, you could. So, now that she's gone you want me to take over? Yes, but it's more than that. I need you, I admit that. But I want you to stay. Why? Well, it's not easy for a man who's.. ...half a man.. ...to talk to a girl. But in the few days you've been here I've grown very fond of you, Susan. Try to understand, I'm not making any wild protestations, I can't. But I...I want you to know that 'you mean a great deal to me.' A very great deal. - I do? - I think you know you do. (Danielle) 'Aren't you going to pack, my dear?' I'm not leaving, Danielle. Georges persuaded you to change your mind. Yes, he did. I think I'll work in my room this afternoon. Of course, my dear. It is a little hot. Have a good day. I'll get Carter to bring some lunch up to you. Is there anything else you need, sir? No. No, thank you, Carter. Well, goodnight, sir. Miss. [water gushing] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [music stops] [screams] You'd better leave me alone. Georges, I want to help you. No, I.. ...got to sit this one out myself. Well, then I'm gonna go tell your mother. No! I've already had my medicine for today. Listen to some more music. I'll be alright. [Georges screaming] [screaming continues] Oh, Georges. Oh, Georges. Oh, my God. Please let me help you, Georges. Need some drugs. It's in my mother's room, she won't give me enough. Where, Georges? - No. - Please, Georges. I wanna help. I can't do without it. I wanna get away from here, with you. I, I've got to get better first, I'm not gonna be dependent on.. Oh, Georges, please tell me where they are. Georges. [screaming] (Georges) 'In my...mother's bedroom.' 'Jewel box.' 'On the dressing table near the window.' [sighs] It's quite astonishing how quickly you've made yourself indispensible to Georges. If you'd give him what he wanted. He'd have no need of me. If I gave him what he wanted he'd be out of his mind by now. I don't mind your stealing from me. Stealing-- At least, you ought know what you're stealing. And what effect it can have on the person you administer it to. But it's medicine. Medicine. How can you be so naive? It's heroin. He's a hopeless addict. Oh, Danielle. That's a criminal offense here in France. Did you know that? And the law is notoriously unsympathetic both to the addict and to the person who administers the drug. Like you, my dear. What am I supposed to do? Very little. I want you to stay here with, Georges. Look after him. He needs someone like you. I've already agreed to do that. Of course. You know, my dear one day you could be mistress of this house. 'I know marriage with Georges would have some...disadvantages' but there are certain advantages as well. Think about it. [instrumental music] [music continues] [intense music] [music continues] [gunshots] [screaming] [water sloshing] - 'Good morning.' - Good morning. 'How is it? Is it nice?' Oh, it's lovely. I don't think I'm ever coming out. What about your thesis? Well, that doesn't seem to matter now. 'But that's why you came here.' I know. It just doesn't seem to be important anymore. 'What is important?' You. Sympathy wearing its ugly hat again? Not exactly. Well, what is it then? Oh. - Never mind. - Come on, tell me. I-I'm in love with you. - I know it's foolish. - Foolish? It's lunacy. 'Look at me.' Come on, look at me. 'Are we gonna have lots of children?' 'Are we?' If we are, you'll have to find somebody else to father them. 'Or you could always go elsewhere' 'and get what a wife gets from her husband' then you can come back and tell me about it. Then we'll have something to talk about 'when we're in bed together!' [piano music] [music continues] [music stops] Never mind, my darling. Never mind . It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter anymore. Not now. [knocking] Who is it? 'Carter, miss.' - What do you want? - I have a note for you, miss. It's from Monsieur Georges. He asked me to tell you not to inform madame. Thank you, Carter. (Georges) '"Dearest, Susan. I want desperately to apologize' '"for my behavior this morning.' '"Please, come to me now. Please.' 'Perhaps, with you...nothing is truly impossible."' I got your note. I've been so miserable all day, Georges. I was even thinking about leaving without saying goodbye. [sighs] Do you want me to help you to bed? Let me stay with you tonight, Georges. Please? I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't sent that note. The thought of leaving without seeing you made me sick. Somehow I didn't even care about you.. [dramatic music] 'Georges, you can walk!' Wh-why did you lie to me? - Why didn't you tell me-- - You've changed, Catherine. Though you're just as pretty. I'm not Catherine, I'm Susan. I'm glad you've come back. Mother said you would. She said you'd come back tonight. [music continues] I've waited so long. Why did you keep me waiting...so long? [intense music] [music continues] Catherine. - Why are you going? - No, no. Don't. [crying] Oh, no, please, don't. Ah, there's nothing to be afraid of. Don't you understand? I forgive you. Oh, let me go! I don't care where you've been. I don't care where you've been. - I just-- - Ow! - Ow! Oh, please. - Please.. - Susan. - 'Georges!' Georges, help me. You're not going back to him. 'You go back to him, this time I'll kill you..' - Ah, no. - Georges! Carter! Carter! Well, help her for God's sake. But your mother said...leave him. Go to hell with what... mother said. He'll kill her. 'Get in there.' [Susan crying] Jacques. Jacques. Come on. Come on, Jacques. Come on, boy. Come on. [dramatic music] Oh, Georges. No. I knew it. You and my brother. I knew it. I knew it. Carter! Leave him alone. But he'll kill her. [splash] [music continues] Aah! Ah! [intense music] Jacques, look it's Catherine. Your Catherine. (Danielle) 'She's come back.' She's come back. Run, Susan. Run. [panting] [banging on door] (Georges) 'Why did you let him out tonight?' Answer me! Mother! Let them be together. He'll kill her.. ...like he did Catherine. Whose fault was that? Catherine was his wife. If you'd left her alone Jacques would be sane. A brilliant composer like his father. Because of you, he destroyed Catherine...and his mind. You've gotta stop him before it's too late. He's gonna tear her to pieces. No. No. Jacques is my only hope now. With a grandson, my husband's music will continue. The concerto will be finished. And the name of Ryman will go on. [banging] [door rattling] He's not gonna make love to her in there, he's gonna kill her. Now you've got to stop him. [dramatic music] [door opens] This is my room, you know? Do you like it? It's very pretty. Catherine, you won't go away again, will you? Not to Georges or anybody. You can stay here now. We can finish father's concerto together. Don't you think you better get rid of that first? Oh, no, I should use it on Catherine when she won't tell me where she's been. I usually use a knife, but this will be better. Watch, I'll show you. Mr. Carter brings them to me. And mother lets me kill her as many times as I like. Catherine. Where have you been? With Georges? Haven't you? Why don't you answer me? You can't, can you? You daren't because you've been sleeping...with my brother! 'Haven't you?' Haven't you? You're a...whore! Whore. [thwack] Look. 'She's punished, you see?' Don't you think that's cruel? Oh, no. It's what happens to her all the time. But you're going me the truth, aren't you, Catherine? Because I'm gonna ask you now. Oh, but-but I'm not Catherine. No. Don't! Don't lie to me. You were in his room tonight, you and my brother. 'Weren't you?' 'You were in his room.' Answer me. Answer me! Answer me. - No! - Jacques, no! You listen to me. You mustn't hurt her. You mustn't hurt her. She's for you to love and for that she mustn't die. She'll give you a son. A son. [dramatic music] [music continues] [gunshot] [splash] Oh, Jacques. She was the love, Jacques. She was the love for a son. Your son. [instrumental music] [music continues]
