Gimme that drink there. Go away, go away. What a treat this is, to ride up here in the pilot house with you, Commodore. Not at all. The pleasure's all mine. How long you been navigatin' the river, Commodore? Ever since I took it away from the Indians. Uh, Hefty? - Yes, sir. - Come and take this wheel. Yes, sir. I didn't know you were an old Indian fighter. Ah, yes. In the old days... Starboard your helm. - What are you doing? - You said to starboard my helm. Never mind what I told you. You do what I tell ya. - In the olden days... - You don't know how thrilling all this is. Ah, thank you. My last encounter with the redskins was over 35 years ago. - I was a mere stripling. - Is that so? I whipped out my revolver... Revolvers weren't invented 35 years ago. ...to, uh, uh... I know that. But the Indians didn't know it. Doesn't matter. I threw it away. Oh, how exciting. Please don't interrupt. I'd just swum the rapids. Had my canoe under one arm and a Rocky Mountain goat under the other. How could you swim without the use of your arms? Uh, uh... in those days, I had very strong legs. Uh, excuse me. Very strong limbs. You must have been full of fire in your youth. I had to carry fire insurance until I was over 40. As I arrived at the river bank, I was encountered by the entire tribe of the Shug Indians, the most ferocious... - Have you ever been to Shug Country? - No, I haven't. Oh, that's fine. I unsheathed my bowie knife and cut a path through this wall of human flesh, dragging my canoe behind me. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... Oh, I'm sorry. Perhaps I've gone too far. But what happened to the goat? He was very good with mustard. I'm very dissatisfied with the ensemble of the coryphées. Joe, there will be no performance on the showboat tonight. - No performance tonight? - No performance tonight. Quiet. Quiet! We're giving the entertainment tonight at General Rumford's plantation. It's his daughter's engagement party. Engagement party? Be gone. Be gone. Be gone. Be gone. Be gone! An engagement party. They're probably going to get married. Uh, probably. Your deductions are astounding. - Don't you think marriage is wonderful? - It's all right for women. Women are like elephants to me. I like to look at 'em, but I wouldn't wanna own one. - What's that tune you're playing? - It's brand-new. - They call it "Swanee River". - No good. It'll be forgotten in two weeks. People can't... People can't remember the tune. Ugh! Suffering sciatica. Water! You... ~ Soon, maybe not tomorrow ~ ~ But soon, there'll just be two of us ~ ~ Soon, you and I will borrow ~ ~ The moon for just the two of us ~ ~ Sweetly and so discreetly ~ ~ We'll be completely alone ~ ~ No other world ~ ~ Only our own ~ ~ Now we must be contented ~ ~ With schemes about the two of us ~ ~ Yet we can have our sweet set of dreams ~ ~ That will come true of us ~ ~ For presently and pleasantly ~ ~ Our hearts will be in tune ~ ~ So soon, maybe not tomorrow ~ ~ But soon ~ Miss Elvira, did you do that because you didn't like my song? - Because I did like it, sir. - Hm. Then how do you like this line? ~ For presently and pleasantly ~ ~ Our hearts will beat in tune... ~ Well, I like that one, too. - Rumbo? Rumbo? - Yes, sir. Come here. More bourbon. Lots more bourbon. - I done put in two quarts already. - Put in two more. - This here's for men folks to drink. - Yes, sir. Doesn't it make you tingle all over when Tom sings? Nothin' but a tall mint julep will ever make my old bones tingle. It appears to me a young man oughta be takin' up with more important business right on the eve of his engagement. When people are so in love, I guess they naturally have to sing. Well, things ain't like they were when Major Patterson was courtin' Elvira. All he knows how to do is fight. Well, I guess Tom knows how to fight as well as sing. I hope not. Now look here, Lucy. I want you to understand. When a girl as young as you are, just starting out in life, begins to talk and spout contrary to... What's that for? For you to stand on while you make your speech, so everybody can hear you. - Lucy... - Yes, sir. ...whatever you do, don't ever be a father. - There's one thing wrong with this song. - What? It doesn't give me a chance to turn, look you in the eye and sing... ~ I love you ~ Tom, you make me feel so wiggly when you act like that. - Elvira, would you like to know a secret? - What? About a certain present a certain groom will give his bride at a certain wedding. - Oh, what is it? - It's a song. A special song, with that line in letters three feet high. ~ I love you ~ It’d take a lot of shouting to sing words three feet high. The way I feel right now, I could sing 'em about six feet high. Oh. - Wait. - Hoo. You heard the instructions. Remember, you do not shoot until I count three. Are you ready, sir? Are you ready, Major Patterson? What is this, an affair of honour? Yes, sir. That's Major Patterson and his brother Joe. They always killin' somebody about something. I guess them two's killed 'bout 40 peoples by now. Ah, 40 each? No, sir, 40 between 'em. How'd 40 people get between them? Oh, I know what you mean. Fairly peaceful citizens. Twenty each, I get you. One. Two. Three. Want those horses to catch cold? Get out of here. Awa'. Elvira, you'd best get yourself dressed. Your guests will be coming right soon. Dear me, I had no idea what time it was. I'll just be a very few minutes. Tom, I've been thinking about making you a present, something useful. - Well, that's very nice. - How are you fixed for shooting irons? Shooting irons? Oh, guns. I haven't any. None at all? What happened to them? I never had one. Philadelphia's not much of a town for shooting. Well, dear me, didn't that Quaker uncle teach you anything but singing? Oh, yes. I told you I was studying medicine. - Didn't you learn the art of duelling? - Oh, no, sir. - Or how to handle a pistol? - Oh, no, no. How did you defend yourself on the field of honour? I don't remember that I've ever been on a field of honour. Oh, dear. Here, Potter. If you're thinking on staying here, you'll need something besides your mandolin. Here. I fetched you that as an engagement present. - Thank you, sir. - I want you to learn how to use them. - I appreciate them, but I... - Listen, my boy. You can't protect your honour with a banjo pick. Tom, I heard what Father said to you. Oh, yes. Judging from his remarks, I guess he thinks I'm a cross between a jellyfish and a canary, huh? You're something we've never had around here before. A man with... with ideals and new things, and I'm proud of you. Oh. Well, thanks, Lucy. - Tom... - Hm? After you and Elvira are married, you'll be practically my brother, won't you? - Sort of one of the family? - That seems to be the custom. And a girl like me should love everyone in the family, shouldn't she? Yes, she should. Well... well, don't get scared if I... if I love you a little more than... Well, all I can say is just don't get scared. ~ All the world our own... ~ Cease! Cease! - ~ Maybe... ~ - Listen to that melodious voice. ~...made our love song start ~ ~ Full was the river... ~ - Tom. - Yes? You're not dressed. The folks from the showboat are here. Young man? Pardon me, young lady. - Was that your voice I just heard? - Yes, sir. I'm Commodore Jackson. I can always use a voice of your calibre on my showboat. That's nice, but I'm getting married. Yeah. Oh, yes. Hm. Uh, oh, oh. Gangway, please. Gangway. I still say that I can always... always use a voice of that... that calibre on my showboat. Oh, what a lovely bride and groom you'll make. Well, I-I'm not the bride. It's my sister. - Good evening, Elvira. - Good evening, miss. Good evening, miss. My dear friends, I have asked you to honour us with your presence on this happy occasion because it is my pleasure to announce the engagement of my daughter Elvira to Mr Tom Grayson of Philadelphia. And I invite you all to join me in a toast to their future happiness. Ladies and gentlemen, I take pardonable pride in submitting for your approval five of my little children. Oh, I beg your pardon. Five little piccaninnies that work for me on the showboat - the Inky Kids. Inks, do your duty. Got a head like a Rocky Ford cantaloupe. - ~ Little David ~ - ~ Little David ~ ~ David was a shepherd boy ~ - What'd he do? - ~ He killed Goliath and shouted for joy ~ ~ Little David, play on your harp, hallelu, hallelu ~ ~ Little David, play on your harp ~ ~ Hallelu ~ ~ Joshua was the son of Nun ~ - What'd he do? - ~ Never stopped till his work was done ~ ~ Little David, play on your harp, hallelu, hallelu ~ ~ Little David, play on your harp ~ ~ Hallelu ~ - ~ Little David ~ - ~ Little David ~ - ~ Little David ~ - ~ Little David ~ ~ Play on ~ ~ Your harp ~ ~ Way down upon ~ ~ De Swanee River ~ ~ Far, far away ~ ~ There's where my heart is turning ever ~ ~ There's where the... ~ - Why don't you join them, Tom? - Oh, why spoil it? Won't you, for me? ~ Mm ~ ~ All the world is sad and dreary ~ ~ Everywhere I roam ~ ~ Oh, darkies, how my heart ~ ~ Grows weary ~ ~ Far from the old folks at home ~ ~ All up and down de whole creation ~ ~ Sadly I roam ~ ~ Still longing for the old plantation ~ ~ And for de old folks ~ ~ At home ~ We've enjoyed your little nonsense very much. Ah, thank you very much. That's what they all say. The greatest show on Earth. And here, here is a little jug of liquor. Oh, thank you. A nice little noggin. It's made right here on the plantation, so you needn't be afraid of it. Never been frightened of liquor in all my life. Bibam sapiente plena est. Uh, yeah? You took the very words out of my mouth. Very well. Good... - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Keep those lights out. Oh. Au re... Get on that box, you Senegambian. Go! Au revoir... Quiet, girl. Viper. Why, gentlemen. Major, I thought you were still down river. I sure am glad... One moment, General. Before I went away, I declared my love for your daughter Elvira. And I was led to believe she regarded my attentions favourably. Well, Major, is that a fact? Why, uh... Now I learn that you are celebratin' her engagement to a Northern man. Why, yes, Major. Elvira's going to marry Tom Grayson, my ward. General, our families have been neighbours for a long spell of years. - And friends, sir. - There's never been trouble between us. Until now. There's nothing now to give rise to trouble, Major. Neither you nor I can dictate what goes on in a young girl's heart. Why, she had never seen Tom before. He took advantage of Hilary's absence and made love to her. It's an insult to my honour, and I demand satisfaction. I calculate my ward will be happy to oblige you, sir. Oh, uh, Tom? - Excuse me, please. - Yes. Looks like you're engaged for good this time. It sure does, but I hope it won't scare away any of my old friends. Major Patterson, sir, I present Mr Tom Grayson. How do you do, Major? Won't you come in and join us? - My brother's card, sir. - Oh, thank you very much. I'm sorry I haven't one of mine with me. Don't you understand the major is challenging you to a duel? - For what? - You've been making love to Elvira. - Certainly. We're engaged. - For which I demand satisfaction. - Excuse me. - Aren't you a little excited? Don't you recognise any code of honour? - No, sir, not that kind. - Tom. Mr Grayson is new to the South, so we'll have to excuse... - There's no excuse for not fightin'. - Name your weapon. I have no intention of duelling just because you're annoyed at my luck. Then it's my right to brand you as a coward. You can brand me anything you like. This is all very ridiculous to me. - Come on, Elvira. - I've never been so humiliated in my life. What are my friends going to think of me if you won't defend me? Miss Elvira, may I call on you tomorrow evening? I shall be most pleased, Major Patterson. Thank you. General. Mr Grayson. I'll never get over the disgrace you have brought on this house. I'm very sorry, but... Don't you understand the meaning of the word "honour"? I thought I did, yes, but if it means killing a man I've never seen before and against whom I haven't any grievance, then I don't. You will leave this plantation tonight, sir. Come, Elvira. Hello, Lucy, honey. My, but you're growing up to be a pretty young lady. - Come in. - I'm in. - Hello. - Hello. I... I just came to say goodbye. Oh, thanks. Goodbye. Anybody can fight. All the men in these parts fight. But what I'm proud of is a man brave enough to stick to his ideals and... and be true to what's in his heart. That's what I'm proud of. Well, you'll probably outgrow it. I'm not outgrowing anything any more. - I'm a hundred years old. - Oh, you're older than that. Well, everything's packed. I guess. - I'll go to the road with you. - What if your father sees you? I said I'll go to the road with you. Well, goodbye, Lucy. Tom. Don't look at me while I'm talking, cos then I'll get all upset inside and can't talk any more. Just look straight ahead like I am. - Are you doing it? - Yes. All I wanted to say is I know you think I'm not grown up enough to mean anything to anybody, but... I don't care because... I love you. Why, Lucy. Oh, don't look. You said you wouldn't. I didn't tell you before because... you were gonna marry Elvira. But now I can say anything I want to, and I'm telling you that I love you more than anything or anybody else in the whole world. You can look now. I've finished. You shouldn't be saying things like that, a kid of your age. Why, I knew you'd spoil it all by calling me a kid, but I don't care. Will you kiss me goodbye? And kiss me like you're never gonna see me any more. Cos maybe that's the way it's going to be. Goodbye. So long... shrimp. - Have you made up your mind? - I'll join you. Good. Here. Sign right down there. This contract's just a matter of form. Whenever you get dissatisfied, we'll tear it up. Well, it's a bargain. Well, here's evidence of my friendship and esteem. May you be on the showboat as long as you live. I hope I prove to be more of a success than I was at the plantation. Oh. That's the spirit, my boy. Remember, a dead fish can float downstream, but it takes a live fish to swim up. - Well, I'd like to have a drink on that. - Oh, no more. You've had enough. Remember your voice. I'll show you around the boat, give you some idea of how show folks live. Well, that'll be nice. What'd I do with that contract? Guess I must have had my other coat on. This bend here is treacherous, but you got nothing more to worry about till Memphis. - Hey, you're whistling. - Well, what of it? Well, that's the first time since you came on the boat. You're starting to forget, aren't you? Forget what? You know. Personally, I liked her little blonde sister much better than I did her anyway. - Where's the commodore? - Below, playing poker. You know, she was kinda sweet on you. I could see that. Oh, she... she isn't out of school yet. - Well, she can graduate, can't she? - Yes, in time. Oh, the mystery of love - the way it performs. Certainly didn't perform for me. ~ Way down upon the Swanee River ~ Let's deal the red ones for luck. Fine, fine. Splendid idea, yes. You want those? We'll throw those away, too. ~ Way down upon the Swanee River ~ You heard that tune on the boat that fella was singing? Wait a minute. Let me cut those cards. - Oh, yes, I beg your pardon. - Thank you. ~...River ~ I'll open for a stack. - I'll call it. - So will I. Gentlemen, I'm sorry, but I've just got to tilt you a stack. - Well, I'll just call that. - Call, too. I'm with you. - How many cards? - One. - I'll take one, too. - One. Well, well. - I'll play these. - Well, well. You are stingy. I'll take one. What are you doing up there? Cut it out! It's all right, they're just playing with those knives. I thought they were fighting. Rogers! You scoundrel, where have you been? I'll bet the works. I'll call it for what I have. - So will I. - I'll just see that, then. Well, all right, I'll just see it. Four aces. Huh? That's funny. I've got four aces. Oh, don't tell me. There's only four aces in the deck, and the man that holds the first four wins. What have you got? That beats me. - What have you got? - I don't know. I've got to look. - Look. Come on, what have you got? - What do you think of that? Ha ha. Just a little pair of deuces. Where I come from, there's only one thing they do with a crooked dealer. Get out! Be gone. Never darken my gangplank again. - I'll learn 'em not to cheat at cards. - Oh, Commodore, you hurt? They ain't made the bullet tough enough to hurt me. You had me scared out of my wits. He gets himself into one shootin' scrape after another. - Little darling. - Cut it out. Go and get me some ham and eggs. Country-style. You're gonna eat after killing two men? Nothing like a shooting affair to sharpen up the appetite. If I was ever mixed up in a shooting, I wouldn't be able to eat for a week. Ham and eggs? Tom, you saved my life. You're the fastest man I've ever seen. I could make you the quickest man on the trigger in the whole world. Well, I... I don't know, Commodore. I guess I'm just not a killer at heart. You don't have to be. Just make 'em believe you are. Sit down! See? There you are. Once you got a man seated, you got him at your mercy. Sit down! - Like that? - Uh, something after that fashion. Not quite it, yes. - Is Commodore Jackson aboard? - Why, I-I don't know, sir. Is he? Is he? - Is he or ain't he? - Yeah, he is, sir, Captain Blackie. You stick to me, and I'll have you hunting bears with a fly swatter. Anything you say, Commodore. There's Captain Blackie. Look, here comes a fella now. Let's make him sit down, huh? Uh... uh... Get those matches... Sweep the... See that they wash the wind... The, uh... Get... The chairs. Have 'em put the chairs on the floor there, off those tables. - How do, Captain Blackie? - Sit down. Huh? Oh, yes. Oh, thank you. Yes, thanks. - What are you going to do about this? - Huh? Oh... Uh, "I owe you..." "I owe you." "I owe you $10,000. Commodore..." That so? That's my signature. $10,000, huh? Huh. Oh... I sewed it up, yeah. Well, that'll be all right. Um, where will you be, say, at half past ten, eleven o'cl... Where will you be at noon tonight? I mean, tonight. Not... - Where will you be around 12 o'clock? - Here. - Uh, where will you be at one o'clock? - Here. Oh. Look here, it's no use you foodling around. - I can send ol' Moses over... - Here! - That's OK, then. See you here at one... - Wait a minute. - Gimme that IOU. - Oh. Thanks for calling my attention to it. Just so that's fair and square. IOU. Here you are. Now be careful. - Don't lose it. Put it in your pocket. - Just a minute. $10,000 cash, or I'll take your boat away from you. Oh... Hey, quit that! - Who's that makin' all that noise? - Huh? Oh. Uh, Colonel Steele. The notorious Colonel Steele. Notorious Colonel Steele? Never heard of him. What's he doing here? Singing on my showboat. Known as the Singing Killer. - The Singing Killer? - Singing Killer, yeah. Old Indian fighter. At the age of six... in order to get through a parcel of Indians, he reached back, pulled out a bowie knife and hacked a path through this wall of human flesh, dragging a canoe behind him! - Call him over here. - Huh? Call him over here. I'd like to meet him. Oh, yes. Oh, he'd be glad to know you. Uh... uh, Thomas? Come here. Be right over. Thomas! Come here. Come here! What is all this? You don't look any more like a killer to me than a chipmunk. - Singer, huh? - Yes, I sing a little. What's funny about that? The Singing Killer. You'd better have that 10,000, or I'll take this boat. - You can't do that. - I can't, huh? Listen... I don't like you and I don't like singers. You'd better not be here when I come back, or they'll carry you off of this boat feet first. I was just waiting for a signal from you and I'd have knocked him high as a kite. Higher. - I wouldn't go on tonight. - Why not? Captain Blackie will kill you. I could protect you, only I've broken both my guns. Here, take mine. I wouldn't go on anyway, if I were you. ~ Once we walked alone ~ ~ Down by the river ~ ~ All the world's our own ~ ~ Down by the river ~ ~ Maybe the river ~ ~ Made our love song start ~ ~ Full was the river ~ ~ Yet more full, my heart ~ ~ So I love you, too ~ ~ You and the river ~ ~ I'll be there for you ~ ~ I and the river ~ ~ You will remember ~ ~ When you hear my song ~ ~ Down where the river ~ ~ Rolls along ~ Stop that. Get off that platform and get off quick. - Would you please sit down? - You're asking me to sit down? Unless you're leaving, yes. Sit down. Play that introduction again. Your piano-playing friend seems to be a bit jumpy. I'll help him to keep his music in place. - Go ahead, play that introduction again. - You moanin' hyena. Every breath you take from now on will be a personal present from me. - Sit down! - You dirty, chicken-livered, yellow... Get out of here, for heaven... Agh! Commodore... Mother of pearl. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll all be seated, we'll go on with the concert. ~ So I love you, too ~ ~ You and the river ~ ~ I'll be there for you ~ ~ I and the river ~ ~ You will remember ~ ~ When you hear my song ~ ~ Down where the river ~ ~ Rolls along ~ Get me some ham and eggs! My boy. Colonel Steele, the Singing Killer! ...hero waiting outside. - Bah to the hero. - I'm a-starved to death. - Me too. I can't pop this corn any faster. Shh. Here comes Annabelle. Did you get it? Here's the butter. - Hurry up with that butter. - Oh, hurry. Want some popcorn? What is it? I guess nobody knows where he is. This is the third letter returned from Philadelphia. Oh, if I could only find him. - If I could only just hear from him. - And what if you did? Girls, quick. Miss Markham, she's coming up the stairs. My letter. I suppose all you girls are sound asleep. Yes, Miss Markham. Oh... ~ Still longing ~ ~ For de old plantation ~ ~ And ~ ~ For de old folks ~ ~ At home ~ I see by the paper that the notorious Colonel Steele has killed another man. A fella named Harry Rumford. Yeah, nephew of General Rumford. - A duel? - No. Fella held four aces, and the colonel didn't like it. I hear he shoots first and asks questions afterwards. But there ain't nobody left to answer 'em. They're sure crowdin' to that showboat to hear him sing, just the same. - Morning, Abner. - Morning, Commodore. - Looking mighty pert. - What'll it be? Well, lemme see. Head, it's a mint julep. And tail... - Aw, well, gimme a mint julep, anyway. - Yes, sir. - Even all prepared for me. - Yes, sir. Gimme a plain sarsaparilla. - Pardon me, gentlemen. - Uh... The lout down there just ordered a glass of sarsaparilla. Ha ha. Uh, where did this Colonel Steele come from, anyway? - Texas. - I thought it was Philadelphia. Uh, was born in Philadelphia, but raised in Waxahachie, Texas. Shot a man's nose off down there many years ago. - Shot a man's nose off? - Yeah. Man had a rather prominent proboscis, after the fashion of all eminent men. Stood on the corner, pulled out a shooting iron, says, "I'm gonna shoot that man's nose off." Shot it off as clean as you could cut it with a buzz saw. - Wasn't he arrested? - Oh, yes, he was arrested. - Jury was out just one minute. - What was the verdict? The verdict? The verdict was he was the best shot in Texas. Colonel Steele, the Singing Killer, singing on my showboat every night - the River Queen. - That's no way to shoot a revolver. - No? - First thing you do is relax. - Relax. Put both feet on the ground. Hold your elbow close into your side. Pull the trigger thus. What are you doin'?! Get out of there! Hefty, get the show together and take it over to the park. This is the biggest 4th of July crowd I've ever seen. I've engaged rooms for you over at the hotel. I see you've added Harry Rumford to my list of "victims". He was killed in New Orleans six weeks ago. I've never been there and I never knew Harry Rumford. - What's the difference? - It's got to be denied. - He was General Rumford's nephew. - Wish I'd known. I could've gotten your picture on the front page. - You certainly got me some fine notoriety. - Aw, thanks. I'm doing the best I can. Gangway, please. Gangway. Wait a minute. Nobody can run me out of a card game and get away with it. That'll teach you not to pull a gun on us. Thanks. Had he been a little bigger, I'd have taken a shot at him my... self. Shh. More decorum, please. This is a public place. - Good evening, ma'am. - I'm Miss Markham. - Did you get my message? - Yes, ma'am. Your rooms are waiting for y'all. Are you remaining long? No. I'm chaperoning the young ladies to their homes for the summer vacation. Oh, girls... Oh, Colonel Steele. We must go there tonight. - He's a guest here in the hotel, miss. - How thrilling. That's the man that killed my cousin Harry. If I ever meet him... - He's the most handsome man I've seen. - Come, girls. - Wouldn't you just love to meet him? - Yes, I'd just love to meet him. ~ And now we must be contented ~ ~ With schemes about the two of us ~ - ~ And yet... ~ - Vin, there's Tom. What you talkin' about, honey child? It's Tom, singing. I couldn't mistake his voice. ~ That will come true ~ ~ For presently ~ ~ And pleasantly ~ ~ Our hearts will be in tune ~ ~ So soon ~ ~ Maybe not tomorrow ~ ~ But soon ~ Tom, I'm so glad to see you. Lucy. Why, Lucy, where did you come from? Oh, you look wonderful. - And all grown-up. - Yes. - Aren't you glad to see me? - Glad? Gee, I know a better word than that. Isn't this a night, though? It's the first time I've noticed the stars since... since you went away. Guess I just didn't bother to look up. I've thought about that night, quite a bit. - Have you honestly? - Mm-hm. I remember how you walked beside me down to the road, so straight, with your head held up. You were trying to tell me not to care about Elvira. - She married Major Patterson, you know. - Mm-hm. Remember how we crept downstairs, afraid that your father might see us? I wasn't afraid. No, I guess you weren't. - You were a queer little duck. - "Shrimp" is the word. Oh, well, you have to forgive that. What if I reminded you of all the things you said? You don't have to. I said I loved you above everything else in the world. Yes, well, I said that you'd outgrow it. - That's what you said. - Well, I knew you would. A man just knows those things. Do they? Yes. A fella... Well, he sort of... It's warm out here, isn't it? - Tom... - Huh? If you don't hurry up and kiss me, I'm never going to... It's about time. Why, you little shrimp. Miss Lucy, Rumbo's downstairs with the carriage. - Why, it is Mr Tom. - Hello, Vinia. Miss Lucy, don't think you have to go to that celebration alone. Not now. I was thinking it would be nice if you'd take me. Yes, but, uh... But the showboat troupe is going to perform. - So I understand. - Oh, Tom, please. - There's something I ought to tell you. - Oh, not tonight. Come on. There's Lucy. And who do you think that is with her? - The notorious Colonel Steele. - Oh! I've gotta meet him. Look, there's the notorious Colonel Steele. - Would you like to sit down for a while? - All right. There they go. Come on. Good evening, Colonel Steele. - Tom, did you hear what he called you? - No. Oh, yes. Shall we sit down? - What did he mean by... - It's better out here. Away from all the crowd and these nice, beautiful trees and comfortable bench and everything. Don't you think so? Lucy, there's... I would've knocked, but I forgot to bring my door. - Girls, this is Mr Tom Grayson. - Oh, I'm so happy to meet you. Pleasure indeed. - Tom Grayson? I thought you said... - Pardon me, what was your name? - What are you talking about? - You needn't act so innocent. Keeping Colonel Steele all to yourself when everybody's dying to know him. - Lucy, you know... - Colonel's the greatest shot in the USA. That includes Texas and the Indian Territory. Tom, these gentleman have come up from the Apalachicola River to hear you sing. Gentlemen, Colonel Steele, the notorious Colonel Steele, the Singing Killer. I'm powerful glad to make your acquaintance, sir. Ah, bevy of beauty. The colonel is always surrounded by a group of admiring ladies. I deem it a privilege to shake the hands of the man who killed Captain Blackie, sir. That encounter must have been well worth seeing. Battle of the century, and I'm mighty proud of him. You must've been proud when he killed Harry Rumford. Harry Rumford. He killed so many, the names slip my memory. Rumford, Rumford. Ah, yeah, uh... Ah, she's gone. What was the matter with her? Lucy, are we gonna lose each other again over a pack of lies? Lies? I never wanna see your face again. There she goes, still walking fast. So... Listen, there's the music. The colonel's about to sing. - Sure wanna hear it. - That'd be lovely. We'll go to the bar. We can hear it better from there. Hey, Tom. There's your music. You boys go on over. Order me a mint julep. - Son, there's the music. - You certainly messed up my life. Me? Why, you wouldn't be in the position you are today if it weren't for me. No, I should say I wouldn't! Ah, that's the spirit. Go up and sing that song. That's the grit I had when I took out that old bowie knife... Oh, all right, I'll sing. ...cut a path through a wall of human flesh... dragging a canoe... ~ Your sweet expression ~ ~ The smile you gave me ~ ~ The way you looked when we met ~ ~ It's easy to remember ~ ~ But so hard to forget ~ ~ I hear you whisper ~ ~ "I'll always love you" ~ ~ I know it's over, and yet ~ ~ It's easy to remember ~ ~ But so hard to forget ~ ~ So I must dream ~ ~ To have your hand caress me ~ ~ Fingers press me tight ~ ~ I'd rather dream ~ ~ Than have that lonely feeling ~ ~ Stealing through the night ~ ~ Each little moment ~ ~ Is clear before me ~ ~ Though it brings me regret ~ ~ It's easy to remember ~ ~ But so hard to forget ~ ~ Your sweet expression ~ ~ The smile you gave me ~ ~ The way you looked when we met ~ ~ Easy to remember ~ ~ So hard to forget ~ ~ I hear you whisper ~ ~ "I'll always love you" ~ ~ I know it's over, and yet ~ ~ Easy to remember ~ ~ So hard to forget ~ ~ So I must dream ~ ~ To have your hand caress me ~ ~ Fingers press me tight ~ ~ I'd rather dream ~ ~ Than have that lonely feeling ~ ~ Stealing through the night ~ ~ Each little moment ~ ~ Is clear before me ~ ~ Though it brings me regret ~ ~ It's easy to remember ~ ~ But so hard to forget ~ I'd like to, but the commodore's strict about shipping anything in his showboat. - He just won't let me do it. - That puts me in a pretty tight hole, Hefty. Just a couple of cases of tobacco and some cigar store Indians. I'd like them put off at Bell's Landing. Bell's Landing. Well now, that makes a difference. We get in there after dark. All right, Sam. Worst target I ever saw in my life. Gotta get a new one. Commodore, I think you'd better have a talk with Tom. Get out of the way, get out of the way. I mean right away, this minute, now. Look here, you want one of these knives sticking in your head? You'd look like an elk running around here. Get out of the way! But listen, last night he got a letter. He's been pacing the floor ever since. That's fine. The exercise will do him good. Move over. Look out. - But he's leaving the boat. - Leaving? Why didn't you tell me? Here, you practise for me till I come back. Put 'em down! Put 'em down! I'll do my own practising. Get these aboard. Take 'em up to my cabin. They'll be safe there. What's all this talk I hear about you leaving the showboat? Oh. "Master Tom. That Joe Patterson says he's gonna marry Miss Lucy." "I says to her she better send for you right off, but she says no, sir." "Even if you don't get this letter, you better come anyhow." What are you gonna do about it? I'm going to the Rumford Plantation tonight. Well, be careful. Them Patterson boys are mighty ornery. - You want me to go with you? - I'm not bluffing any longer. I'll have to handle this myself. Lucy's got her head full of stuff about me, and I'm going to straighten things out. ~ Way down... ~ What's this doing here? Get it out of here. ~...down upon the Swanee River ~ - Those Indians still out there? - No. That's good, because I was just about to go out there and box their ears. Did I tell you about the time I massa-creed a whole tribe of Indians in Shug country? - Yes, you told me. - I didn't tell you the details, of how I unsheathed this bowie knife and cut a path through this wall of human flesh, dragging my canoe behind me. What do you pull away from me for, Lucy, honey? Why so offish, Lucy? If I were Joe, I'd quit calling on you. She ain't quite made up her mind yet. Have you, honey? I believe she's in love with somebody else. - What if I am? - Then you are? No, but if I were, it'd be my own personal affair. Elvira, you picked your man. Why don't you let Lucy choose hers? Lucy, there's something I'd like to settle with you. There's nothing I can ever settle with the notorious Colonel Steele. Wait here. - Where are you going? - That's nothing that concerns you. Tom Grayson. So you're the notorious Colonel Steele, eh? - That's what they call me. - You're not going up there. What's gonna stop me? Well... - What's the meaning of this intrusion? - Ah, Major Patterson. - I let you off easy once... - Sit down! I'm afraid that you have me at a disadvantage. - I'm not armed. - How do you know I am? You wouldn't dare address me as you have if you weren't. Some more of your code of honour, huh? Reach for it. Careful. Sit down. Tom, it appears to me you've gone just about far enough. Well, I'm sorry if I've intruded. You asked me to leave here once because I had no code of honour. Well, I haven't any yet. At least, not their kind. I found out there's some things a man has to fight for. That's why I'm here tonight. If you'll excuse me, General. I'm sure these gentlemen will. Lucy. - Lucy, unlock this door. - Go away, please. - This has all been a misunderstanding. - I don't want to hear any more about it. - Shall I break this door down? - You wouldn't dare. You're coming with me. Unsheathing my bowie knife, I cut a path through this wall of human flesh, dragging my canoe behi... ...behind me. Since that time, of course, I know the red man and his pale-faced friends have smoked the pipe of peace. Why, I would no more think now of harming a hair on a red man's head than I would sticking a fork in my mother's back. Ha. Why, some of my best friends are Indians. Shug Indians. Tom! Oh, don't let anything on the River Queen ever surprise you, darling. You used to call me something sweeter than "darling". - You little shrimp. - That's better. ~ For presently and pleasantly ~ Our hearts will be in tune ~ So soon ~ ~ Maybe not tomorrow ~ ~ But soon ~
