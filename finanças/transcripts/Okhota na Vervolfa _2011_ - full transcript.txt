Autumn, 1942. Vinnitsa. Hitler's headquarters "Wehrwolf" Lieutenant, when? We have been digging for a month. We must have dug a 100-metre ditch behind the barbed wire. Shut up! Lieutenant, there is already some concrete by the entrance. The hole will be closed soon, and that will be the end of us. Now... Now... Take my place. Moscow, the Kremlin, 1942 The Head Committee believes that the failure of the last four sabotage operations can be attributed to information leaks from the army's headquarters. The enemy knew even the minute details of the operations. We must have a rat amongst us. All generals are under suspicion. Including yourselves. I demand that you immediately look into any possible connection between the highest command and the information leaks. Yes, sir. The checks have already started. First of all I suggest we narrow down the potential suspects. Secondly, we should hold an inquest... And who will be doing the fighting? Did you think about that? Should we put everyone in prison because of one traitor? We will not have an inquest. I order you to immediately start preparations for a special operation. Gather a group and send it to the German rear. Hitler is staying near Vinnitsa feeling quite at home. And I have an order to spare no efforts to liquidate the Wehrwolf. Let the group gather intelligence data. Comrade Commissar, this is an impossible order. We'll only lose people. The partisans told us there was a 20 km security zone around the headquarters. They have a Gestapo regiment there, military troops and surveillance posts every 500 metres. They carry out air surveillance too. We have already lost three scout groups. Nobody came back. Stop it! Don't worry if they come back or not. This is war! Tell the suspects about the operation. Either the rat will expose himself or we'll gather very valuable information. That is, if anyone from the group comes back. I'm trying, Tank-man. Be quick! Here you go. The patrol! Stay quiet! Swimming Baths Sorry, Hans. I must have got carried away. Let's get closer to business. What is going on in the Ukraine? Let's talk alone, in a calmer atmosphere. The building of the headquarters near Vinnitsa is almost finished. Do you think it's time for me to move to the East? Goering promised that no bomb will fall at Vinnitsa. Really? He promised the same about Berlin too. The war has its own rules, Hans. The F端hrer's life is invaluable for the nation and the German Reich. Keep him safe, then. You're heading the Reich's security service. I have one idea. We secretly send our body doubles to Vinnitsa and you stay here. Our doubles. Wonderful, Hans! Yes, F端hrer. Understood. Proceed! Comrade Commissar, in accordance with your order, General Vasylevitch, General Zarytsky and Division Commissar Salov are here. - Is that all? - Yes. According to our operative data they are the most likely candidates. Sit down. Send the generals in. Do you know what the Germans call the reinforced zone near Vinnitsa? Little Berlin. Polyakov? According to our agents' data, no fewer than ten German agents' training schools are located in that zone. Himmler's headquarters, Goering's headquarters, the headquarters of the High Command of the land and air forces, and most importantly Hitler's new headquarters "Wehrwolf". We don't yet have an exact map of the reinforcements in that zone. Sergeant? The roll call is soon. We must run. They are running to the minefield! We need the dogs! The dogs, Major! We'll go through the water. Attention! Mines! I'm sorry. Thank you. Moscow, the Kremlin One nation, one Reich... May I? Comrade Commissar, out of 12 candidates, we chose Major Sedov to be the commander of the intelligence service group. Who is the man? Eastern Prussia. Fortress of the regional Nazi HQ. 1942 Nesterov, take the group away! There's no group any more, Commander. Stop or I'll shoot! Yesterday a man came to the partisans 25 km away from Vinnitsa. He called himself the Major of the regiment's intelligence service Gryshin. Are you one of ours? Through and through! Are you partisans? Take me to the squadron. I'm hungry. He told them that he was taken prisoner. Together with other prisoners-of-war he was building reinforcements for the Wehrwolf headquarters. He escaped. The information that he gave us was verified. The unit number, the surnames of the commanders, where it was deployed... Everything matches. Comrade Commissar, we suggest to use Gryshin as the group's guide. The timing of his escape is so suspicious! Comrade Commissar, the commander of the group will have an order to immediately eliminate Gryshin if there's a hint of suspicion that he could be a traitor. All right. We don't risk too much, considering the real goal of the operation. Tykhvin. Special Department Eat, eat. Don't be shy. State your surname, rank, the aim of your crossing the front line. I'm Major Sedov. I was carrying out a task at the enemy's rear. - And the goal of your mission? - I'm not at liberty to disclose it. When and where were you sent to the German rear? Comrade Lieutenant... Don't call me comrade! Comrade Colonel, over the last two days three German saboteurs were arrested in the area under my supervision. They say that they are our intelligence scouts... At ease, Lieutenant. Thank you for your service. Pleased to meet you, Major. The major is my responsibility now. Leave us alone for a few minutes. Yes, sir. Thank you, Lieutenant. It was very tasty. - Hello. - Hello. They knew we were coming to the fortress. Someone tipped off the Germans. We'll sort that out. Is anybody else alive? Only Nesterov and you. He is being taken care of at the moment. So Nesterov is alive. This is great! One second, Comrade Nesterov. It was so great before the war! I used to be a seamstress at the Bolshevitchka factory. We made great suits! All the diplomats and actors wore them. Everybody! Even Comrade Kalynin himself... delivered his speech at the party's meeting dressed in one of our suits. Really? Yes, he delivered his speech in a wonderful suit of ours. When the war broke out, our girls' brigade decided to be trained as nurses. I see. That's what we decided. - It's brilliant! - Thanks. Good. Be calm! This is why I was looking for you. You are appointed as a commander of an intelligence service group with a very special task. - Has the group already been formed? - Why? I have one request. I want you to include Captain Nesterov in it. I have no objections against Nesterov. Great! You'll also need another person, a real professional cartographer, the best one. Are you Lebedev? Semen Ipatyevitch? Inmate number 36487. You have two minutes to pack your things. I'll meet you outside. Yes. The village of Shkotovo. The snipers school - We found him. The sniper is there! - Come on! Why did you hide so badly? We've found him, Comrade Colonel! - Look for the other one. - Yes, sir! This is enough. Sniper, stand up! Come forward, Private! So be it. Guards Sergeant Tykhomyrova. Comrade Colonel, I'm here at your order. Not bad. I serve the working people! Keep training according to plan. But we will need another one. We have one good man, but he is in the penal battalion. Call off his charges. I'll take responsibility. The Voronezh Front. The 27th Penal Battalion Third here. Put me through to Twelfth. Hi, neighbour! We can't make a move. He is gunning all the men down. Give us Semenov! The machine gunner is in the pillbox. Help us out! Semenov! Our people are to the left from here, in the quarter 3412. Help them out. Aim at the pillbox. Step aside. Semenov, the commander is calling for you! The commander? All right. - Popov? - Yes? Escort Semenov to the company commander. Hello. Comrade Major? Here's the thing, Semenov. Consider that you have redeemed your mistakes. Uglich. Intelligence service headquarters Tykhomyrova? Come in. Sit down. We're asking you to participate in a secret operation. Taking part is voluntary. You may refuse if you wish. Out of the question, Comrade Colonel. Fill in this form, then. Would you stop staring at me like that? Are you married? - Well, you know... - Stop it! Answer the question! I'm not asking you just for the sake of it. Two groups before you failed to return. No, I'm not married. To be more exact, we didn't have time to register our marriage. He was in the air force. His mother received the death notification. I'm sorry. Do you have any relatives, any close friends? - Not a single soul. - This is good. Does this mean there is no chance of us ever coming back? There is always a chance. You just need to grab it. Think it over well. Berlin. Sixth Department of the Central Intelligence Service The F端hrer is resolute. He still wants to move to the East. I don't understand why you worry so much. The Russians will never get to the plans and secret drafts of the F端hrer's headquarters. All the builders of the Wehrwolf will be eliminated. Nobody knows about the most secret bunkers and underground tunnels, including Struwe and Danner. In any case I wouldn't hurry with the move. The Russians are preparing a group of very experienced saboteurs to deploy in the area. Did you get these data from your agents? I'd like you and your people, and not Danner, to meet them there. Certainly. I'm ready for that. I'm glad that I can rely on you. Spasskoe. Intelligence service training school All right. Let's save the steam for the Fascists. Here he is. Comrade First Sergeant, this man's come to you! Comrade First Sergeant? What, Lebedev Semen Ipatyevitch? Inmate number 36487. You're not an inmate any more. I'm First Sergeant Stakhovitch. May I? The code name of the operation is "Wehrwolf Hunt". The wolf? You may say so, Major. Wehrwolf is the name of Hitler's new headquarters in the occupied Ukraine. Your group's mission is to map all the fortifications of the headquarters. This is why a professional cartographer, Lebedev Semen Ipatyevitch, was made a part of your group. He is one of the best cartographers of the Soviet Union. And the most important thing is that he is the only person who is familiar with the fortifications system of the Wolfschanze headquarters in Eastern Prussia. Pay special attention to the location of anti-aircraft batteries and hidden runways for the fighter planes. A liaison will supply you with the latest reconnaissance data obtained by partisans. You'll meet Lieutenant Gryshin there. He'll lead you into the zone. I believe that you know him. Yes, I do. He is a clever guy. That clever guy spent a year in a German prisoner-of-war camp. I see. You'll be given papers and German uniforms. Avoid engaging in battles. Don't expose yourselves. You have to be operative in the zone in four days. I want to ask you a question. What about Nesterov? Do you remember my request? I've submitted my report. We'll take care of that. The First Shock Army Hello. Did you bring the mail? Hand it over. - May I? - Come in. The operation will be called "the Wehrwolf Hunt". Colonel Zotov is in charge of the formation of the intelligence service group. The group has practically been formed. The landing will take place here, outside of the 20 km security zone... At ease. So, guys... Our time is almost up. The flight is tonight. Shoot a little, get your equipment. You have a day. Comrade Colonel, may we write letters to our loved ones? You may. But no details, of course. Report. Comrade General, the group is ready for the flight. They are leaving in 8 hours and 34 minutes. Brilliant. The rat will expose himself during that time. Are the receivers ready? They are. We turned them on as soon as the generals got their envelopes. Good. Send the radio operators to me. I want to know about all the outgoing signals. Yes, sir, Comrade General! Vinnitsa. Hitler's headquarters "Wehrwolf" I'm Korvettenkapit辰n Kurt Jost, the inspector. I'm Colonel Struwe, the war commandant of the headquarters. I'm the head of security, Untersturmf端hrer Danner. Welcome to "Wehrwolf"! Do you know the exact date of the F端hrer's arrival? You have four days to complete the preparations. Uglich. Intelligence service headquarters Comrade General, Colonel Zotov is on the line. Keep me informed of the movements of all the vehicles. Yes, sir. Over and out. Goodbye! Here it is! Comrade General, we have a signal! Vehicle number one. The bearing is 24. Vehicle number two. The bearing is 132. Vehicle number three. The bearing is 270. Comrade General, the radio operator is in the square number 3680. Understood. - Zotov? - Yes. Stop! The radio operator is in the square 3680. Do you copy? - Copy. - Bring him to me alive. Stop! I'm shooting! Stop! Capture him alive! Don't shoot! If you surrender, we promise to save your life! Stop or I'll shoot! Get back! Herr Korvettenkapit辰n. Here is the encoded message. Stand down. Put me through to Berlin, Gruppenf端hrer Ratenhuber. - Hans? - Yes, Kurt. Any good news? The Russians are leaving from Uglich and will land in square number 12. - Do you know the time? - They'll be here in five or six hours. Meet the guests. Let's start the game. How could you lose the radio operator? Comrade General! I'm ready to be court-martialled for this. You will. Where is the body? We're looking for it. The current is too strong. And there is a whirlpool there. A whirlpool? What do we have? Have you decoded the message? - Yes, we have. - What was in it? "Wait for the guests in square number 12". That's all. What does square number 12 mean? It must be some system of the German topographic signs. I knew that without you. But what exactly does it mean? Do you realize that we're sending kamikazes? They are waiting for them! We can't cancel the task. We could have caught the traitor. But we failed. Wake up. Here you go. Change the landing square. Report to Zarytsky. Maybe he will take the bait. So it is Zarytsky, after all? If they are met in the new place, then it's him. It's a pity that we can't send the receivers there. Besides, maybe he doesn't have another radio operator. All we can do now is wait. I suggest arresting Zarytsky. Wait with the arrest! What if it's not him? What if we lose the real traitor? How could you lose that radio operator? What shall we do with Zarytsky, anyway? Don't touch him. Put him under surveillance. Do the same with the rest. Go on! Yes, sir! Uglich. The airport Comrade General, the group is ready for the task. Major, in accordance with High Command's decision, your group is reinforced with snipers. From this moment on you're to obey Major Sedov. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Dress the ranks! Group, to the right! Major, you're to open this parcel after meeting the liaison. If there is an extraordinary situation, it is to be destroyed, even if your plane is knocked down above the Kremlin. Good luck to you! - May all of you return. - Good luck! You know what you have to do. Yes, I do, Herr Korvettenkapit辰n. Good luck. What a pity that we're flying at night! We could have marvelled at the Ukrainian landscapes. Our forests and lakes at the Ural are no worse. Ural girls certainly are no worse than Ukrainian girls. What are you called, Comrade Guards Sergeant? No one calls me. I go when I choose. Cool down, Captain. Drink some water. They say in the navy that a woman on board a ship means trouble. Captain, are we on board a ship? We're almost there. Get ready. Hitler's headquarters "Wehrwolf". 30 km security zone The dogs are barking. It looks like a raid. Ten minutes earlier, we would have been killed. - We got lucky. Where is Semenov? - There he is. - You may go. - Yes, sir. The group arrived. They expected us. The Germans are searching the woods. It is Zarytsky, then. Could be. Why are they searching the forest? Maybe the group didn't land in the exact spot. Our nation was created by Almighty God. By glorifying it we're glorifying his work. God is on our side, isn't he, F端hrer? Of course. Are you tired, F端hrer? Yes. The war is a hard job. The Ukrainian air will rejuvenate you. I hope so. The headquarters near Vinnitsa are ready for your arrival, F端hrer. We used some additional measures... Good. What measures? The operation has already started, F端hrer. I sent my best man there. He is a person of exceptional abilities. The other groups must have returned to the unit long ago. Calm down, Willi, stop whining. How long shall we go back and forth? We were up all night. It's already morning. I'm hungry. Shut up, Willi. What if the saboteurs that we're looking for are already captured? Everything is clear below. The group of 15 soldiers. Two dogs. May I meet them? I'll help, Comrade Lieutenant. No, we shan't make any noise. Let's try to break away from them. From the dogs? All right, do it. There is a hermitage 2 km from here. Here it is. We'll meet there. Understood? - Yes, sir. - Come on. I think we shall report to the Major that this square is clean. The dogs sniffed something. Search! Put me through to Berlin. Gruppenf端hrer Ratenhuber. Yes, Kurt. What do you have? Hans, everything is serious here. There is a group of saboteurs. They killed 20 people in the course of three minutes. They were snipers. One person from the Bavarian group died. Don't touch anything! Don't touch anything! Do you understand? I hope that the situation is under control. Of course it is. The operation is in progress, Herr Gruppenf端hrer. Is this our liaison? - I'll check it. Cover my back just in case. - Yes, sir. Hello, kind man! Hello. I've been sent by Nicolay. Which Nicolay? Bychutkin? Ivanov. Thank God! The task is fulfilled. Thank you for your work, Lieutenant. Happy to serve the working people! Comrade Guards Sergeant, did you decide to replenish your arsenal? This one is good for close engagement. Take this, Captain. Thank you. Come on! Let's go. They met the liaison successfully. It means that it wasn't Salov. No, it wasn't Salov. It's either Zarytsky or Vasylevich. Or there is no traitor at all. How can it be? How do the Germans get the information, then? Why did several well-planned operations fail? Where did the radio operator come from? It would have been great to ask the radio operator about that. Comrade General! All right! We'll open the second card tomorrow. The traitor is bound to take this bait. I'll see you to the zone, and from there you'll go on your own. Sure. But we'll need the help of the partisans. They must make some noise at the railway station tomorrow to distract the Germans. When? I'll tell you tomorrow. Let's get some rest. The Wehrwolf is a 100% protected place. All the walls are double. - What about the residential spaces? - See for yourself. No Russian plane can bomb our bunker. Even long-range artillery won't harm it. What about the Russian saboteurs? They won't be able to pass through the first line of fortifications. What about the incident during the construction? I heard that two Russians escaped you. That is a lie. It is impossible to escape from this place, or get in. Wake up! Why so early? Faster, faster! Check the building! Comrade General? What's happened? A radiogram from Sedov. The Germans found the liaison. Any losses? No. The group managed to run away. It means that it is Salov, after all. Salov. He was responsible for the meeting with the liaison. Wait for me here. It's a safe place. I'll bring your comrade to you. All right. Semenov, check the area. - Captain, prepare the radio! - Yes, sir. Salov knew the exact coordinates of the meeting place. But the group managed not only to get there but also to spend the night at the base. Why? The Germans only came in the morning. It doesn't add up. Maybe they wanted to avoid suspicion. Or they didn't know about that. How did they get to know, then? Maybe they calculated their meeting place accidentally? They accidentally found the landing place, then they accidentally found the liaison. They seem to be playing with us. I wish we understood what kind of game it is. Comrade Guards Sergeant, I wanted to ask you... How do you hit a squirrel in the eye? Here he is - safe and sound. Nicolay. Oleg. Moscow, the Kremlin What is it? My report, Comrade Division Commander. I ask you to relieve me of my position and send me to the front. I see. What has happened? Comrade General... A man who can't be trusted can't work at my post. Why do you think that the High Command doesn't trust you? I'm sure that counterintelligence wouldn't dare investigate me without your permission. The conclusion is evident. And the German command are plotting an attempt to eliminate all the heads of all the General Headquarters' departments. All the people who might be of interest to them were assigned additional secret guards. Including you. Any questions? How strange. How could such information be kept from the head of the intelligence service department - me? I'm not a newcomer, Comrade Commissar. Let's call a spade a spade. I'm being watched. And even if you are, then what? What, I ask you? You, an experienced agent, come to me and say like a shy pupil, "I'm being watched, I'm not being trusted..." If you were not being trusted you wouldn't be standing here. Taking into account the failures of our latest operations at the enemy rear, operation "Wehrwolf" didn't surprise me. After having understood the real aim of this operation I carried out an investigation in my department. Here you'll find materials that will acquit me. I've also included the case notes for a person whom you don't suspect. I believe that this person demands close attention. - May I stand down? - You may. From here on, you go without me. If you need me, contact me through the Centre. Thank you, Father. - God save you! - Goodbye. I haven't smoked for a while. How were you taken prisoner? It was silly. I failed to even take my agents to the first task. It was so silly! In the course of the very first battle our regiment was ambushed. So you raised your hands and surrendered, didn't you? No. I was shooting till the last bullet. What do you want? The truth. There was a blast and I don't remember anything after that. I opened my eyes and saw that I was lying on an open platform with short sides. I was surrounded by half-dead bodies. And the red sun was jumping off the tops of the trees like a ball. Then that picture turned upside down and enclosed me like a coffin lid. I'll be honest with you. I was sent here to check your credibility, among other things. How are you going to check me? You'll go with me. If anything happens, I'll personally shoot you. - Thank you, Commander. - You're welcome. This is how we always do things. OK. Go and eat something. Help yourself, Comrade Major. Damn it... Moscow. The Kremlin Yes. No, there is some logic in this. Comrade Commissar, let me play the second card. If we don't get any new information, we'll arrest him. Comrade Colonel, may I? What do you have, First Sergeant? Go! Comrade Colonel, our postman disappeared. What do you mean, "disappeared"? Well, there's been no trace of mail, nor of him, for two days now. Why didn't you report to me at once? Who knows, Comrade Colonel? Maybe he just... Just what? Maybe he drank too much or fell ill. What if I reported him and he suddenly turned up? You would issue a reprimand or even something worse. First Sergeant! He is nowhere to be seen. We've searched the entire territory. His bag is not here, he is not here. Vanished into thin air! We'll solve this. Detachment, here is the order. This is an order from the Chief Commander of the Military Counterintelligence Service. Take measures to liquidate Adolf Hitler. According to operative data, Hitler will arrive at the headquarters on September 23rd. Between the entrance to the headquarters and the bunker there is a little path. Everyone will be there to welcome him. This plan has been developed and approved by General Headquarters. The coordinates are approximate, but the destination and the route of the object are exact to within 100 metres. If they manage to get inside that zone a sniper's shot is a plausible option. It should be carried out from a distance of no more than 500 metres. How do we get to within 500 metres of him? There is a water tower 200 metres away from the headquarters. I think that this is a great position for the shooting. This place is ideal for the shooting. The second sniper shall act according to the circumstances. You should shoot from two different angles to increase the probability of success. So using the German uniforms and documents... We'll get inside the outer perimeter and cross the river. The partisans will make sure they divert the attention from our group. This should happen on the eve of Hitler's arrival. The Germans will throw in all the forces of the Vinnitsa garrison to repel the attack and to secure the territory. This will make the task of the main group easier. - The group must get into the 3 km zone. - Yes, sir. Draw a map and help Lebedev hand that map over to the partisans. This task seems to contradict the first one. No, it doesn't. Otherwise why would you be here with us? How do we enter the 3 km zone? We have Comrade Gryshin for that. After completing the task, everybody must leave for the predetermined positions. Here they are. What a good exit plan! Captain, we will retreat if circumstances permit. Is that clear? Yes. This could work. Be careful with this piece of paper. If you don't have it when you're in the 3 km zone, you'll be shot on the spot. If you have it, it will give you a few minutes. I'm a professor from Ahnenerbe. What's so funny? I'm sorry, Comrade Commander. It's just that I was always an opponent of these charlatans, and now I'm one of them. Are you ready to lead the expedition, Professor? I serve Professor Richthofen and his charming assistant! Comrade General, a coded message from Sedov. Give it to me. You're free to go. Sedov's group have begun the task. It's time to throw the second bone in. - Call the generals. - All of them? Prepare the receivers and the service of external surveillance. Do you think that the traitor has another radio operator? - It is possible. - Yes, sir. This is it, the 20 km zone. It may be reached only by air or by road. There are block posts everywhere around the perimeter. And further away there are minefields. There isn't a single weak link. How did you escape this place? I don't know. I got lucky. Lucky! A lucky man! - Nesterov? - Yes? Go to the barrier with Lebedev and Katya. Make a scene. Try not to make much noise. Yes, sir, my general! Semenov? Cover them. Gryshin? Follow me. Watch out for us, Semenov. I'll try. Lieutenant, can you help us? Identify yourselves. This is Professor Richthofen, assigned here by the F端hrer's personal order. The professor sprained his leg and our car got stuck in the bog. These Russian woods and bogs... such wilderness... I'm sorry, Professor, but I'll have to report your arrival. Sure, Lieutenant. Today we start the second part of the operation "Wehrwolf". Look through the materials. This is our goal. Any questions? Hitler's headquarters "Wehrwolf". 20 km zone - Detachment, get ready to engage. - Yes, sir. Fire! He wasn't given an order to leave the area, he didn't have a leave warrant, none of the drivers took him to town. So it's the postman? What does it all mean? What is it? The report, Comrade Commissar. The report? No radio communication was recorded. The external surveillance didn't bring any results. Comrade Commissar! After receiving information about the attempt at Hitler's life, none of the Generals took any steps to pass this information to the Germans. - So you still don't know who the traitor is? - No. Danner! What is going on here? Who is responsible for this? According to our data the column was raked with fire from the German armoured car. There were people in German uniforms inside it. The armoured car was stolen at the block post. Danner, you haven't forgotten about the F端hrer's arrival, have you? We lost three people. - The Russians don't have any losses. - They are real professionals. They want to reach the headquarters. Therefore, they'll have to cross the river. They fire flares every five minutes. We do have a chance to cross the river. It's too narrow. What if there's an ambush there? - There's nobody there. - God helps those who help themselves. Shut up! Withdraw. - How is it? - We won't be able to cross the river. We won't... - So the bridge is the only option. - It will be full of Germans. At 11 pm the partisans will make noise at the station diverting the Germans' attention. We must be near the bridge by that time. You and you, go there. The rest - follow me, and hurry up! So, three people will pass the water tower, and two will scale it. You - go to the flame thrower. Six people will cover you. We must make noise at the station. - God help us! - God help us! Personal case Zotov, Andrey Valeryanovitch Strictly Confidential So it is Zarytsky, after all? It was Salov. Salov. He was responsible for the meeting with the liaison. Go there. Search the forest! Catch up with them! Eliminate everybody! Be quick! Quick! Where are you going? This way! What kind of circus is this? What are you doing here? The partisans, Herr Korvettenkapit辰n! They set the oil storehouse on fire. My people are searching the forest. You're an idiot, Danner. What partisans, what storehouse? The Russian saboteurs are forcing their way to the headquarters on the eve of the F端hrer's arrival. And you sent a part of the garrison to wander in the woods! What were you thinking of? Is this the way to eliminate your enemies? What did you need this storehouse for? Why today? Tell him, tell him! Go to hell! You made a fool of yourself. It was a means of distraction. Stand up. Colonel Zotov, you're accused of treason. Hello, Comrade General. I was waiting for you. I knew that you would come and I know why you're here. Sit down. You're not the only person capable of analytical thinking. I'm not a traitor and I can prove it to you. Give it a shot. As for all the failed operations, like the unsuccessful attempt on the Gauleiter's life in Eastern Prussia and so on, I was only involved in forming and preparing the groups. I didn't know the exact plans and didn't have the detailed information. But I knew everything about operation "Wehrwolf" from the very beginning. Therefore there was no need for me to send pieces of information to the Germans every day and risk disclosing myself. But this is all deduction, like our Comrade Commissar likes to say. And here is my alibi. What is it? The drowned radio operator - the lost postman. The postman? Yes. The traitor was sending letters with the help of the postman. Shit... Our mistake was to look for the traitor in the ranks of the High Command, not amongst the people on the ground. The traitor is in the group, Comrade General. Who is he? Three people wrote the letters - Lebedev, Nesterov and Sedov. I doubt that it is Lebedev because he was in prison just a week ago. So it is either Sedov or Nesterov. What a pity that we can't warn the group about the traitor. We can't. Sedov is the commander and Nesterov is the radio operator. We will warn the traitor. Hitler's headquarters "Wehrwolf". 3 km zone Let's separate here. Those who stay alive will meet at this spot. The deadline is 5 pm. Gryshin and Lebedev, your task is the drawing up of the map. Go, Gryshin. Will the snipers go without a guide? Go, Gryshin. Save Lebedev for me. Tykhomyrova and Semenov... Right. Take this. Guard? Let the escort go. We may consider the operation to be successful. There is no traitor within our High Command. And whether it is Sedov or Nesterov, we'll get to know very soon. The one who comes back is the traitor. Right. 1.5 km away there is a row of six machine guns. They are covered with camouflage netting. - Comrade Major, there. - Here is the warehouse. - The Germans are behind the hill. - What? See for yourself. Shall we continue our dispute, Otto? Here is the souvenir, Herr Oberleutnant. Here is the subject of dispute. What do you say? Three. I will bet on four. - Do it. - Yes, sir. I don't want to die. I don't want to. Dear Mum. I don't want to die. I don't want to! Hold on. We'll be avenged. Raise your head higher. Lower it. Will you lie here? They can't be saved. Stand up. Everything is as you wanted it. Stand up, I tell you! This is the order, Nesterov. Vinnitsa It depends on the view... We're not in Germany. Treat yourself. This is suicide. We won't be able to get there. Let's look for another position. Ten degrees to the left... What building is that? It is a sewage treatment facility. The canalisation? The sewerage, a pumping station. I think that this pipe leads to the headquarters' communications. And maybe even to the main bunker. Faster! Surround them! Faster! What, Professor? Come on, hold on to me. Leave me behind. Here, here... Hold on. Hold on, Professor. Hand the map over to Sedov. He'll understand. I marked all the objects. Do you remember the sewer? It is your only chance to get out of this place. They should have already been here. If they are alive they'll come. The task is completed. Here is the map. Have you done it? Here are the films. Professor Lebedev died. I failed to keep Lebedev safe. Katya! Comrade Major, that was not Hitler but his double. Lieutenant Semenov died. Tykhomyrova, take this. Your order is to pass the bag to the partisans. Understood? What about you? I don't want to... Stop the hysterics, Guards Sergeant. Sedov, 100 metres from here is the hole we broke through. It leads inside the headquarters itself. We still have a chance to complete our task. But when we were preparing for the escape the Germans were closing the entrance with concrete. How shall we deal with the concrete? Don't be afraid. You're a lucky man, aren't you? Let's go. We'll follow you. The partisans' camp Stop! Where are you going? I need to see Father Luka. - The Germans make great concrete. - What shall we do, Commander? What, what... The First Sergeant's presents came in handy. Gryshin, have the gas grenades ready! Crawl away! Put the gas masks on! Keep low! Look - our PPSh! Brand-new! Where did they get them, I wonder? In our storehouses. These are much better than theirs. Having such an arsenal they can hold the line for a year! Don't kill him! He'll show us the way. Captain! Take the machine gun, faster! Take guns and two disks of bullets. Faster! Remember - the only way out is through the sewer. It leads to the river. This is the only way of getting out of here. Take us to the F端hrer, scum! Move it! Go and do what you need to do. This is not the first time that I've died. This was so easy... so easy... Do you want some, Comrade Major? To help his soul rest in peace. I feel sorry for him. He is an actor from the Vienna theatre, one of a dozen of the F端hrer's doubles. A double? What are you talking about, Captain? Hauptmann, Major. The Germans made me the Hauptmann. That's why the Germans knew about our task, its goal and our arrival. The same goes for the attempt on the Gauleiter's life. Are you surprised, Major? Hitler wasn't here. Your bosses got a piece of disinformation... Major, can't you see that the war is over? Your bosses set you up. You were a pawn till the very last moment. That's why I suggest you stay with me and fight on the side of glorious Germany. Major! You're a professional. A professional doesn't care on which side he's fighting. You're not cannon fodder like Gryshin or Semenov. The guards will be here in two minutes. I warn you for the very last time... Here is a present from our people, scum! The Russians are eliminated, Herr Korvettenkapit辰n. You're an idiot! Where do you see the Russians? This is the body of my agent. Where are the Russians? I'm sorry, Herr Korvettenkapit辰n. What if the F端hrer trusted you and came? You'll be court-martialled, Danner. Oh, God! To the sewer tank! Be quick! Faster! We received the last radio message from the partisans. Two people are alive - Major Sedov and the sniper. They'll be sent here today. I ordered my people to arrest Sedov. So operation "Wehrwolf" was a success. You may report so to the High Command. I don't believe that Sedov is a traitor. Let's wait for his return. Yes, sir. Vinnitsa. The ruins of the "Wehrwolf" headquarters
