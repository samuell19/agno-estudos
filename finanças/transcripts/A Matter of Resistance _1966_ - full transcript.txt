- Marie! Marie… Someone's taken apples from us again. 12 yesterday, 15 the day before that, and 7 more today. 54 in one week. Do you consider it normal to steal 54 apples in a single week? Come on, it's downright monstrous… We live remotely, know the gardener well… Can you explain to me… Marie, are you listening to me? - Are you accusing me of stealing apples? - I don't mean you. But apples are disappearing. So, someone's taking them. - Is that all? - It's not nothing. They're Calville, the best selling kind. - I don't care! - Very well, very well. So you don't mind being robbed. - Right. I've had it with your pears, your apples, your honey and your bees. I don't give a hoot about your harvest. Marie, why get so upset. I'm not making a big deal over 54 apples. It's just that there's a mystery here, you see? - When are we going to Paris? - Excuse me? - You heard me, when? - We were on the subject of apples! - And I want to talk about Paris. 2 years of marriage! 2 years of you cheating me! - Me, cheating you? - Absolutely! You dangled the good life in front of me, your apartment on rue Vaneau, but nothing ever comes of it! It's a scam. - A scam… - What will I ever use these dresses for? I won't stand for it! I'm making you sign a contract. - What's gotten into you? - I've had enough. Come on! I hereby commit… to moving… to Paris… with my wife… within… Oh, rubbish! - You weren't made for drawing up contracts. - I hereby commit… - I'd love to take you to rue Vaneau. - What are you waiting for? - It's impossible. - What do you mean, "impossible" ? - Physically impossible. The apartment's occupied. - By whom? - By people. - What people? - The people I rented it to. - You rented it out? - Of course. - Since when? - 2 months, 2 and a half. - And you didn't tell me. - I did, but you never listen. - No, you did not tell me! - Yes, I did! - Liar! Creep! - "Liar…" - Don't touch me! - Marie… Where are you going? - Hey hey, come on. Take it easy, now. Come on, what is this... Oh, hey you. What's wrong? Your eyes are red. Have you been crying? - It's Jérôme. - Go ahead without me. - He rented out his apartment. Without telling me. - To a mistress? - No. - Oh, good… That was more his father's style. Traveling to and from Paris all the time. - But dad, he promised! - Are you dining with us? - No, I'm not hungry. - Go on, get her a plate! You won't find a table like this in Paris. - Pauline, can you get some sheets out for my bed? - What for? - To sleep in it. - You're staying over? - Would that bother anyone? - Your husband, child. - I'm not going back to him. - But his place is your place. It's your house. - It's his, not mine. And I'm leaving. - You get back there right away! - Never! - Come again? - I'm divorcing him! - Dear lord… Take that back! Take it back! - No! - You want to bring shame to our family you little bitch? Stop! Stop or I'll crush you! Come here, you! I raised you, sacrificed everything for you! I set you up with a comfortable life, and you ruin everything! Where are you going? - To the station, to catch a train. You won't see me again! - I'm going to have a heart attack. Marie, come on! Marie, listen to me, my little bird. We get carried away… Say some nasty things… Your husband's not a bad guy. - He doesn't love me, if he did he'd follow me. - He will follow you. He's a gentleman. It's only a matter of time. Come now. You remind me of your mother. Impulsive… Always quick to take offense. Don't forget that you're the lady of the manor. You have a responsibility, to set an example. Look at them. They're judging you right now. Come and eat something, my dove. - This poor house… What time is it? -9:30. -9:30... If I'd have done that to your father, he… - He what? - He'd have sent the dogs after me. - Different times, different customs. - You don't leave without warning. - She probably had dinner there. - At the farm? Who says she's over there? - Where else would she be? - Go and look for her, head out to meet her. Act like a normal person. - Excuse me, mom… - You make me light-headed sometimes. - Listen, mom, you know how Marie is. She goes out, comes back in. She's free, like a bird. She has no curfew. - I know. You're open-minded and I'm old-fashioned. But I'll tell you what I think, when you've got a 20-year-old wife you don't let her flirt all over town. Good night. - It seems to me that you're missing something. We live in the countryside. - So I noticed. - So, why not let Marie go out as she pleases. If we were in Paris, with its bars, that might be a problem. But instead we're here, thank God. Why do you think I enjoy the countryside so much? Hmm? - Who are you? What are you doing here? - I was very hungry. - Who gave you permission? - Well… I love apples, and these are some of the best I've… - Jérôme! - Marie? - Let me explain. I've got the wrong house. I was supposed to go the neighbors. - What neighbors? - The Faure-Campoys. - There are no Faure-Campoys here. - Wait, we're in Calvados, right? - No, in the Manche. I've got the wrong department. - You're kidding me! You're stealing from us! - Yes. - You've been here for a week. - Yes. - My husband is going to beat you up. - No. - Why not? - You won't tell him. - We'll see about that! - Marie… - Let me go! Let me go or I'll scream. - So now, the truth, the real truth. It's for you that I came here. I admire you, watch you live. I'm here on holiday. I was passing by and noticed you. I froze. Love at first sight. I came in here, I hid. I live in the chapel. You can scream now, I don't care. Thanks. - Keep your distance. - Sure. Bless you. - Mister! - I don't find that very funny. - What? - I'm not in the mood for hide and seek. - I'm sorry. - Do you know what time it is? I was starting to get worried. Why were you screaming earlier? - I fell off my bicycle. - Oh, Marie, my child. You're limping, are you in pain? - It's nothing... my ankle. - There? - No. - There? - Ow! - It's your ankle alright. Let me take care of that. - Did you find your thief? - Let's not bring that up again. - What if he was a lover I was sneaking food out to? - I'd make him pay what he owes me, and then I'd shoot him with my rifle. - That's very kind. - Straighten your leg. - Don't waste the Calvados ! - It won't be wasted, look. You smell nice, you smell like apple. Go on, get up! - Is that better? - A little bit. - Anything else I could do? - Carry me. - I bet your ankle's fine. - How did you know? - Oh, blistering balderdash. - Don't let go of me, eh. - Not to worry. - Good morning, mother. - Oh, Marie, what a pleasant surprise! I thought you were lost. Come on, let's go. - Mister? Mister, are you there? Liar… Dirty liar! - 12, 13, 14, 15. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 20. Oh, it's you? I was waiting for you. - While taking pictures? - Yes. The environment you live in, your arbors, your flowers, your shrubs… Which one is your favorite tree? - My favorite tree? - Yes. Women always have a natural confidant, a plant that listens. - Do you think I'm stupid? - I wouldn't dare to. - You're lying! - Not at all. I was… - And this, what's this then? A map. - Ah, indeed it is. - Put that thing back away. - There's a slight misunderstanding here. Allow me to clear it up. - Get up. - Have they left? - Yes. And I'm leaving, too. - I'll explain. - No thanks, I got it. You're in the resistance or something. Well, carry on then. Goodbye. - Huh, where are these guys coming from? - They've got some nerve! This is private property, didn't you see the sign? - We're just out for a drive. - You don't just drive on my property. If I catch you again, I'm telling my friend, the general Von Busch. He's the one who had that sign put up. If you can't read, buy yourself some glasses. Thank you, madam. - Be reasonable, now… Hear me out. - Say, that's a nightingale. Did you hear? - A nightingale, at this hour? I doubt it, sir. - I'm not dreaming. This is the nightingale, right… - No, that's a warbler, sir. - Oh, yes, I'm confusing them. Is that the nightingale then? - No, that's a linnet, sir. - Aah... - They're easy to mix up, but the nightingale's… You were right! This time, I can hear it. - I have a message, sir. You have to be in the chapel at 10. You'll have a visitor. - Who? - I don't know. A commander. - That's all? - Yes. Goodbye. - What's going on with the Germans? - Nothing, just driving around. - Why aren't there any of them here? - The old lady would throw them out. - And she wouldn't get in trouble? - No, thanks to the general. The one who runs the entire sector, Von Busch. She says he's a friend, and they leave her alone. - Do they know each other well? - No, no, she's making it all up. That's her thing. Just how she is. Watch out! - Its nest was in the lime tree. But it's been at least three months since… - Hey! Oh, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Kid! - You again? Get out! - I had to make up an excuse yesterday, I just blurted something out. I acted… - Like a selfish cad! - Okay, but you have to understand we're at war. - War, and what else, why not hay fever? Get out of my sight. Bless you. Leave or I'm calling my husband! - You wouldn't dare. - Jérôme! Jérôme! Come quick, Jérôme! Jérôme, come here! - Marie! Marie, where are you? What's wrong? - Did you cut your nails this morning? - Uh… yes. - Where did you put the scissors? There they are, silly me. - It won't hold up. - What won't? - My heart. It's going to give. You again! What did you do? - It wasn't me, it was the gutter. - Hold on, mister Jérôme, I'll teach him a lesson! - No idea, huh… No opinion. We're occupied by the enemy, and you're neither hot nor cold. In short, you're waiting for it to blow over. - My turn. - One of these days, this war's going to end. What are you going to do then? Stay here until the end of your days? - Awkward shot for you, this one. - I don't feel like playing anymore. Your son worries me, madam. He's in the wrong, my daughter is getting anxious, and… I'll say! - Never mind that. - And to think it'll soon be the same at my place… - Your place? Come on now… - The roof's coming apart, it's raining in the attic… - We haven't had any rain. - Next winter… Just have my roof fixed, for heaven's sake! - My dear Dimanche, let's not fight. You're family now. If your roof's bothering you, fix it yourself. - It's not mine to fix! You're the landlady. - Please, Dimanche, let's not get petty. - If you can't handle it, then step down. Sell the farm! I'll buy it and fix everything up. - You think everything's for sale. - Everything, madam. - What kind of man have you become? You never once raised your voice when you were our sharecropper. - You're refusing to sell because you can't! It's mortgaged, like everything else. - Who told you that? - You can't even pay your interest anymore. There's nothing left. Your dearly departed spent everything. - Enough! - I'm not done. - Get out! - One day, this dump is going to be auctioned off. - My castle! - Yes, your dilapidated shack. They'll sell the land, the farm, the little forest and do you know who will be buying the lot? Me, madam! - Jérôme! Show him out! - You'd better leave. - Suits me. I'm tired, I'm going to bed. At your service, captain. - Yes, that's alright. Who are you? - My name's Dimanche. Vendredi, in the resistance. - Clever. - I'm responsible for half of this department. Got everyone under my thumb. - Is that what you came to tell me? - No. There's a message from London. They're sending a plane. They're coming to pick you back up. - When? - Tonight at 3:00. - Tonight, that's out of the question. - Is your work here not done? - It is. - Well, then? - I don't feel like leaving. Do you understand? I like it a lot, here. - I beg your pardon captain, but… You can't be serious… you're moonstruck. The plane's on its way. The runway's been marked. No time to waste. It's 40 km from here. Come on, captain… - Alright, let's go. - Aah, you've got it together again, I see. - Will you be taking me? - No, the resistance men. - Aah... Do you think that's them? - I don't know. - What should we do? - You hide. - Hi, Vendredi! Always ready to go, huh? - What do you think you're doing? - Scaring you a little. - We've been here for 45 minutes. Tell the Englishmen we're waiting for them. - Can you pass on a message for me? - At your service, captain. - There's this young lady at the castle, Marie. Go see her and just tell her this: "he'll be back". -"He'll be back." - That's it. - But who'll be back? - Me, of course! She'll understand. - Have you been inside the house? Were you seen there? - Of course. But be discreet, the husband mustn’t know about this. Thank you. - I've got a message for you. - Aah? - There. Messalina, floozy, libertine! Slag! I don't know what's keeping me from... You put on a charade, "daddy, my husband doesn't love me!" Then behind my back, you seduce our best soldier? - That guy in the chapel? -"That guy", as you call him, is a hero of the resistance. - That's not true. - What do you mean, "not true" ? He's not in the chapel anymore, he's in England. - In England? - Yes. Before he left, he told me everything. - Told you what? He was probably lying, I know him. - Aah! So you admit it! - But it's not true! Completely untrue. You're getting on my nerves. - Aah, my dear father-in-law. - He hit me. - But… Yesterday you insult my mother, today you beat my wife. - My daughter, my business. - Excuse me? - I'm watching her. - I won't stand for it. - That's a pity. - Get out. - Watch your manners. - If you come back here, I'll shoot you. - Shoot me, with what? You've never used a gun in your life. - Please leave, dad. - No, no. Not before you know why he won't take you to Paris. Why he stays here, picking apples and pears. I figured it out. Can I tell her? It's because he's afraid of guns. Afraid of fighting. My girl, your husband is hiding here! Holed up! - The Germans. - What, the Germans? - In the courtyard. - Major Klopstock. Sir, I'm under orders to settle here on your property. We'll be as discrete as possible. We won't damage anything. - That's going to be difficult. - No, no, no! Impossible. Gentlemen, it's impossible. - Sorry, madam. Orders are orders. - I've discussed it with general Von Busch, he agrees with me. - Certainly, but he left for Russia the day before yesterday. - Would you happen to know anyone else, mother? - Why, I know all of them. All of them! They all agree with me. This is impossible. If I say so, it's true. Impossible. Do you not understand French? - German police! Open up, German police! Open up! - Lousy cretin! - Boss! - Here! I'll show you… Are you quite done? - Pontaubert! - I'll translate. - 500 m behind the Blockhaus, there's a private domain. 90 hectares, surrounded by walls. This is the house. Or well, the castle. Crucially, not occupied by the Germans! Not a single soldier on the grounds. - Right in the middle of the domain, there's this open field. The Commandos can drop there with complete peace of mind. Your men will gather, pass in front of the house and cross the park, towards the sea. A 15 minute walk. At the end of the park there's this wall... There. And in that wall, this breach. Once past the wall, you'll be able to see the Blockhaus. From then on, there's only 100 m to go. 100 m in the open. It's the only tricky point. You'll have to be quick. Then, it's the Blockhaus. Surprise attack. - Ooh! - We drop in unexpected, the whole deal will be over in 10 minutes. Maybe less. Gentlemen, I've done my best. Now, it's up to you. - Do you know what's she's talking about? - Marie, now there's a woman. You see? A real one, like they were before the war. No kepi, no salute... No, with a little dress, little feet, apple trees all around... A flower of the fields. You see? - Yes, you're in love. You're done for. She's inviting us to her sister's in Devonshire. - Marie, you'd want to sleep with her... without touching her. - I've had enough of her. And you, shut up! - No, I didn't say anything. - A woman, is tenderness, affection. You get home, she's waiting for you by a lamp. Then it's all calm and quiet. Marriage... - There he is. We've been looking for you for 2 hours. There's news. Terrible news. It's back to the drawing board. The Germans are occupying the castle. You're the only one who can go back there. You leave tonight. So, Pontaubert? Get moving, they're waiting for you. - Alright, you can let go of me now. I'm telling you, I'm fine. Look. You can count on me, my colonel. Don't worry, it'll be fine! "And to see my Normandy again..." "is the most..." - Be quiet. - Hmm? - Be quiet. - What did I say? - Nothing, you're snoring. - Me? Never. Oh! It's the German. You see? He got the message. - Is he serious? - I'm going to have a word with him. - A parachutist! Poor boy. - Did you call for me? - No, no! - But you were knocking. - Wasn't us, definitely not us! - What are they doing? - Pretty girl! - Hey! Hey! - Wake up! Wake up! - Mister! Mister! - We'll have to climb up there. - The ladder! - Women... My colonel, she's more than a woman. - Marie, get back down there. Down! - Aha! Morning gymnastics! - Come along, dear friend. Smile, and don't say a word. I'm planning to put rose bushes here... maybe even a pond, or a fountain, who knows. In any case, we're expanding! And then over there, a lawn, where turtles can come and go as they please. - Turtles? - You've got nothing against them, I hope? Alright then… There, I might dig... Hey, where are your manners? Give the lady a hand! I'll teach you some gallantry! A little quicker than that! Get a move on! You call yourselves soldiers? Yes, chop-chop! - Is it you making that racket? - But madam, I was trying to help. - By shouting, at this hour? These aren't your barracks. What's going on? - We have a visitor, mother. A surprise guest. A parachutist. Commander, have you met my wife's brother? - It's an honor. - Whose brother? - Bobby, don't you remember? - Oh, of course! Did you have a pleasant journey? - I have a headache... - Come here, we'll take care of that. - Ooh la la… My head... - What's wrong with you? - I'm hung over. - Had too much to drink? - They're drugged for the jump. Like your father, in '14, before the attack. I'll get some aspirin. My little Marie, go find some aspirin. Your brother has a hangover. - My brother? - It was Jérôme's idea. Isn't it funny? - Yes, very… - How about that aspirin? - In the bathroom. - Always washing. It's like a disorder. - Let's give him some rest. - My parachute? - Shh! - You have to bury it. - We're working on it. - Anything else? - Yes, some apples. - I have just what you need. Are you ready? - Bring him this. - No, not me! - Hurry, mother! - Yes, I'm coming. - Cruel woman! Heart of stone! Never a smile, never a glance. I came here for you. You little rascal! You love doll! - You're crazy! Let go of me! - Madam, dear madam. Marie. Dear Marie. My Marie. - Let go of me, you're crazy. - Oh lord, he's killing me. - Who, me? - No, that German. Following me around everywhere. - That animal. I'll slaughter him! Marie? Marie? I lied. The first time I saw you, I told you a lie. But it turned out to be true. You're the only one for me. The others don't exist. I didn't understand, until I left, and thought I'd lost you. I was going crazy in England. Shouting your name in the streets. Marie, I came back for you. I'd like to take you away. Yes. Away from the world, from people, in a house of our own, all ours. And no one around. - No one? Oh no, anything but that! Oh... - What's wrong? - She's ill. - And you? - Me, I'm cured. - Marie, are you unwell? - Excuse me. - Aah! It's yours. Are you staying with us for a few days? - He can't, mother. We don't have any more beds. They've taken them all. - We'll manage. - I wanted to ask you... - Anything you want. - I have to see Dimanche. - Don't count on me! He's a vulgar individual. A young man like you shouldn't associate with him. - It's dad! I'll drive you there. - No, you're staying here. He's old enough to get there by himself. - I'll tell you how to get there. - Turning away a man who's risking his life! - I'm not turning him away. - He could get shot. And you don't care. - Not at all. - You wouldn't bat an eye. You haven't even taken off your robe. Scared of getting tired? - Come, now... - Well then, didn't you leave? - I did, but I came back. The castle's shaped like this, a horseshoe. The garrison's here, in the servants' quarters. We're going to mine the servants' quarters. - Mine them? - It won't be easy. - I'll handle it. Then, I settle into the castle and wait. On the eve of the landing, they'll radio us. - Yes, yes. - When you get the message, you let me know immediately. And 4 minutes before the drop, that is 4 minutes to midnight, I'll blow up the garrison. Problem solved. - Oh, yes! - The old lady won't like that. - It'll teach her. - Alright, I'm going to need explosives. - I have some. The detonators. The plastic. I'll cover them up with some eggs. There you go. - I'm sorry about the other day. I had no idea you were her father. - It doesn't matter, my captain. There's enough here to make a nice omelet. - There's nothing going on with your daughter and me. - That's between you two. She's old enough. She can do what she wants, I'm not meddling anymore. I've understood. - Aah? - Haven't you seen what kind of family she's ended up with? The mother's an old bat, the son, a milquetoast. - A milquetoast? - Absolutely. A blockhead. He could easily move to Paris with her. - Paris, what for? - That's all she dreams of. She's bored here. She wants to socialize, have a little excitement. - Really? - I'm telling you, he refuses to take her. Why? You tell me. I get stressed just thinking about it. Let's change the subject. Say, when do you think they'll land here? - Soon. - Sure, but when exactly? - We don't know. No one knows. - That boy's been away for over 5 hours! Something must've happened. - I'm going. I've lost my bicycle clips. - Where are Jérôme's clips? - I don't know! - What's she doing up there? - She's on watch. Go on then, hurry! - Returning from the market, Mr. Bobby? - Yes. - I'll give you a ride. - Thanks, that's very kind. - Mr. Bobby, tell me, honestly, how do you feel about your brother-in-law? What kind of man is he? - A milquetoast. - Excuse me? - A blockhead. - Can I let you in on a secret? Strictly between the two of us. - Of course. - Your sister's magnificent. - She's charming. - Nein. She's more than that. She has such a tight and supple waist, - And have you seen her calves? - Yes, that arch! - She's a superb creature. - More than that! She's like a fairy! - You think? - She haunts my thoughts. But she won't listen to me. I'm getting desperate. - One should never despair. - You think? - I'm telling you, aren't I? - But how can I show her... - Leave it to me. - You? - I'll talk to her. - Mr. Bobby, you're a true friend. - Just call me Bobby. - Call me Sigi, the name's Siegfried. - There we are, Siegfried. "We'll go and hang our laundry on the Siegfried line" "Pretty white linen for us, la la la la la" Schimmelbeck! - Yes, sir Major. Anything to report? - No, sir Major. - Has the exercise taken place? - Done, sir Major. - What kind of posture is that. Suck in that gut! - Finally! Where have you been? My son went out looking for you. - Did you run into him? - No. We need to hide this. - What have you brought us? Eggs? - Oh! Big ones, too. - Explosives. - My God! - What are those for? - Sabotage. - Sabotage! What a great idea! You could have wiped your feet, look at those dirty boots! - I beg your pardon, madam. - No, really! - Now's not the time to upset them. On the contrary, be nice, smile, reassure them. - You think? - Yes. Show some friendliness, charm. Invite him for dinner. - At my table? - It's crucial. You'll see, he's a very nice lad. - Consider it done. I thought these would brighten up your room. - Flowers! - Don't you like them? - I do. - Like any good army man. It's a shame, we never get the time to chat. Oh well, we each have our own problems. Do you need anything? - No. - A change of bed sheets? - That's too kind. - Would you like some reading? Oh, I see you're set. Oh, you rascal! - I'll pick this up tonight. - You know, I'm having regrets. I haven't treated you right. - You admit it? Good. - How was I to know? - Know what? - You should have told me you were a hero. - A hero? - Tell me. - About what? - War, the enemy... - Oh, routine. Marie... - Surprise, my children! The commander's joining us for dinner and he's bringing champagne. It will be modest though, I don't have any servants. - My men are at your disposal. Schimmelbeck! Send me six men, with clean hands! - Yes sir, Major. - Very good. Wonderful! Carry on! Mr. Schimmelbeck, when you're done, you can show me the attic. - Our first champagne in 4 years. Make a wish. I'll tell you mine. I'd like to see Marrakech again, before I die. - Marrakech? - Yes, the palm trees, the camels, such memories! - And you, where would you want to return to? The beach we went to when we were little? - Where did you spend your vacations? - Oh, all over. - Yes, Deauville, Trouville... And you, Major, will you share your wish? - It's a secret. - Something to do with a woman, perhaps? - It wouldn't surprise me. - That's right. - Can we know her name? - No. - Just the initial, then. - M - Noémie? - Not N, M, as in Marrakech. - Ah, M! M like Marie. - Exactly. Marie... There is no prettier name. - I agree. Sister dear, if I ever get married, my wife will have your name. - How about we move to the living room? - 2 minutes. In fact, never mind Marrakech. My only wish, is to have some real coffee. Schimmelbeck! Excuse me. Schimmelbeck! - What's this? Oh, coffee! How did you guess? Are you a sorcerer? Marie, come have a look. These lovely little black grains. - I'll make some. - My men will do it. - No, it's my pleasure. - Me, I'm taking my glass with me. - Did you talk to her about me? - A little. - Are you coming? - Right away. What did she say? - It's going to take some more talking. - How about now? I'll keep the husband busy. - Alright. - Mr. Jérôme, how about some billiards? - Aah, do you play? - I'm champion of my village in Westphalia. I got the... You know... - Can I be excused? I have important work to do. - Sabotage? - Yes. - Go on then, go. Go, go! Charming music! - Oh, it's you! You startled me! You can't stay here. - What's that? - Plastic explosive. - What for? - To blow them all away. - Tonight? - No, later. Don't tell anyone. Promise? - I promise. - Now, leave. - I'd like to help you. - No, go! - Please. - Okay. Take the basket. Bravo, you are... - Commander! Commander, help me please. Your men are playing the same thing over and over. - What would you like? - Meyerbeer. - Where is he? - Who? - What's his name... Bobby. - He'll be back. - I didn't see him leave. - He went out for a stroll. - And Marie? - Making coffee. - It doesn't take an hour to... - Aah, coffee, what a perfume! Jérôme, where are you going? Stay. - Stay! - There's no Meyerbeer. - Shame, I adore him. Do you know his sonata? Are you a musician? - I used to play a lot, in Westphalia. Or well, a little. - Where's my wife? My wife! - You know what I'd do, if you loved me? - Yes, I know. - I'd take you away. - I know, to some secluded place. - No, I've been thinking, and you're a city girl. We'd go to Paris. - Paris? - Right. We'd go out every night. - Come with me. Come! - Let go of me. Let go of me. You're hurting me! - From now on, you're staying in your room. - Are you locking me up? - Exactly. And I'm throwing out your parachutist. What kind of manners... I save his life and he tries to seduce you? - He has every right to. - What do you mean? Watch your mouth. - He's a man, a fighter. And you've chosen to do absolutely nothing. When the Germans arrived, you ran away. - That has nothing to do with it. - I understand now. My father was right. You're scared to death. - You don't mean those terrible things you're saying. - Let me out! - No! Marie, get out of there! - No! - Marie, I'm asking you to come out. Marie... Marie, please. Let's leave. - Huh? - We're leaving. - Huh? - I'm not staying in this house. - Huh? - Stop saying "huh"? Come along. Don't you want to anymore? - Get up then, let's hurry. Are you happy? - Over the moon. - Kiss me. Are you awake now? So! - I see, Mr. Bobby. The "little brother". You thought you could make a fool of me? Who are you? Tell me. - First, let go of me. No, you answer me right now. - Let him go. - I'll explain. - Do explain, I'm listening. Have you lost the power of speech? - No! - Schimmelbeck! - Come, quick. - My suitcase! Hey! - No, no! Where are they? Where are they dammit! - Gone, gone. - And you're standing here glued to the ground? Get them! Aah, there you are! I have great news. Your wife left with her lover. Your used to it. It's not the first time? Shut up! - What's gotten into you? Did you hit your head? - Shut up! I've had enough. Enough with the politeness, the flowers, the Meyerbeer. I'll make some music of my own. - You're insane! My piano! - I'm beat. 15:38. What time is that? - 20 to 4. Why? - The train. We can still make it. - We're not taking that train. - There's another one at... 20:10. - Paris is out of the question for now. I can't leave right now. - You said... - Of course, but I have an assignment. - Your sabotage? You can sabotage whatever you like in Paris. - We'll go there later. - Later? Later! It's always later. You're all the same. - I'm here for a very specific reason. - I thought it was for me. - Yes, for you too. - You lied to me. You're talking rubbish. You'll never change. I have the worst luck. - Marie... - What's going to become of us? - Let's go to your father's. - God, no! - Listen. Schimmelbeck, wait! - I can't hold him, sir. - Over there. You idiot. Crap! And crap again! - Do we have to stay in the water? - Just a bit longer. - Why? - Because of the dogs. - I'm cold. - Shh. Don't speak. Shh. - 8:30 sharp, you hear. Don't forget! André, stop by the mill. You, Lucien, go tell Morel. Where's my bicycle? Roger, my bike! Isn't anyone here? Anyone here? Easy, gentlemen, let go of me! Let me go! You're crazy! Listen to me. What right do you have to... Stop it! Gentlemen. - You had the audacity to come back here? - Trust me, I didn't come for fun. I'm not here for you, but for your guest. The young man who's staying here. - He's gone. Left this morning. - Where to? - I can only tell you who he left with. My "guest" ran away with your daughter. - Impossible! What about the garrison, the Germans? - They're out looking for them. - He can't have left just like that. He must have left a message. - No, no... - Dreadful. - Don't worry. She'll be back. - It's not her who worries me. - Who then? - The Americans. - What did they do? - They land tomorrow! - Are you kidding? - Didn't you get the message? At midnight tonight, the first paratroopers are landing right here. Here? - On our property? - Yes, it's all going to start from here. - There's a hostel over there, I'll see if they have a room. Wait for me here. I'll be right back. - Get out! - Where is she? - I don't know. - Listen, mister, you made a fool of me in order to impress the woman I love. Well played, I admit. In different times, I'd have challenged you to a duel. Nothing better than a duel, to settle matters of honor. But I suppose you don't even know how to hold a Sabre. - That's right. - I knew it. Now, where is she? - I'm telling you, I don't know. - Would you like me to notify the German police? I bet they'd love to hear all about you. But I don't want them to interfere in this personal matter. So, for the last time, where is she? - What do you want from her? - An honest conversation with her, you, and me. I want to know how she truly feels. - I can tell you that. - It's not up to you. It's up to her. So? - And she won't be in any trouble? - You have my officer's word for it. - So you're not mad at her, about...? - My head. It's seen worse. I like liveliness in a woman. It's a sign of a good character. Well? - She left. - Marie? Ms. Marie? - Not you, you'll scare her away. She can't be far. Where's your dog? - We lost it. - Great job! Marie? Marie? - Ms. Marie? - Shh! Marie? - Hey, what about me? - Calm down, stop thinking about yourself! - Rise, gentlemen. Hands up. Hands up! - Hände hoch, mister. Hands up! - Turn around. Umdrehen! To the basement. Der Keller! Let's go. Come on! - Well, Jérôme… - I'll say, you didn't waste any time. - What time is it? - 23:10. Only 45 minutes left. - Where are they landing? - In the field behind the chapel. - They can't, they put spikes everywhere. - The Krauts? - Yes. - When? - The day before yesterday. - Dear lord. - Sweet Jesus! - Terrible. - Jérôme, what are you doing. You'll never make it. - Go get the horse. - What for? - Just do as I say! - Alright, alright. One second. - So? - Nothing. And you? - Nothing. - Marie? - Ms. Marie? - And your soldiers? - Don't mention them. Good-for-nothings. I don't even know where they are. Schimmelbeck! - Go, Fifine. Bravo, Fifine. - They're coming! They're coming! - I'm not done, come and help me. - There they are. Quicker! - Come on. Come on! We'll show them the way. - What was he asking about? Your friend. - Oh, of course. - Mother! - Well, children, I'll leave you to it. I've done enough for today. Come, girl. - Say, the kid... my daughter, or well, your wife, where do you think she could be now? Yes, I know. I said some things about you I didn't mean. But with your manners, your silence... You can be irritating, sometimes. I'm sorry, but... Like your insistence on staying here. Yes, I know... Paris doesn't excite you anymore, you've had your share of partying… But you could have thought about her a bit. - What do you think I do all the time? Who do you think I stayed here for? You know, a girl in Paris... Don't you see, I brought my entire life to a halt three years ago. For her. - Stay behind the wall. - But I won't be able to see a thing. - See anything? - No, nothing. - Point it to the left. - Hey... hey! - Where are you going? - Taking out the light. - How? - With this. Trust me. I'll go around the left, and bam! - What are you doing there? - This is a forbidden zone! - What's he up to? - No! Don't bother! Gentlemen, it's nothing. Just my father-in-law. Mein Schwiegervater. He's a drunk. Er ist betrunken. He's had too much to drink again. Aren't you ashamed at your age? Wino! Alcoholic! Don't move. Hand me the grenade. Just a moment! He's in such a state. Give it to me. - Never! - Do you recognize me, gentlemen? From the castle next door. Can you help me out, between neighbors? Zwischen Nachbarn. Would you happen to have a stretcher? - Give me back my grenade! - Get down. Play dead. - Give me that! It's an order! - I don't care. - Go lie down. - Give it to me! Oh, my god. - Dad! - What's going on? There's something wrong. Look. - Leave! Go! You'll get yourself killed. - Don't move! - Where's Jérôme? - Well, that's done us a lot of good. - Just as I was about to make her mine. - Who? - Marie. - Loser. - Yes... We're losers. - I meant you. - Ah, me? But you haven't understood a thing. I would've only had to snap my fingers. But I was behaving as an officer should. - You're dreaming. Marie wouldn't even have time you. Zero. - Zero? - Zero. - Certain female gestures and looks are unmistakable. I could have had her if I wanted to. - My eye. - It's true though. - It wouldn't have taken her a second to choose between you and me. - Say... - I know women! - How about this, do you know this? It can't be. - Impossible. - Are you hurt, Jérôme? Are you in pain? - No, I hit my head on the way in. That door's too low. What's with you, you're soaked. Did you catch a cold? - No, it's nothing. - Take my jacket. - No, keep it. - It's for you. Come, now. Two months later. - Your turn. - Not bad, not bad. Getting there. You're making progress. - Oh, no, no, no! - Sorry, darling. - You're doing it on purpose! It's unbelievable. - Oh, come on! - Don't give me that. Listen. Listen to me! Albert! Albert! Albert...
