Is Kool here yet? Yeah, Kool is here. He's in the back yard with his gangster rapper buddies. - Mom, he is not a gangster. - He's not? Then what is he? - He's an artist. - An artist? If he was an artist, he'd be in college. You know college isn't for everybody. Then who's it for? It's for me. I'm going to college and Kool isn't. What, so you want to support a rapper? - We'll support each other. - You'll support each other? You be nice to your new son-in-law now. Excuse me? Son-in-law? I don't think so. Darling, do you have any idea of the life span of a rapper these days? I don't want my daughter to be a widow at 25 years old. I want more for you. I want you to marry a doctor or a lawyer, not some flaky artist. - I like Kool. - It's not that I don't like him. I don't like the company he keeps. Now what did I tell you? "If you want to see your future tomorrow, look at your friends today." Come on, girl, get some sense about you. Okay. I love you, Mom. I love you, too. I love you, too. You are my baby girl. I'm still marrying Kool. Hey, you guys had enough food? Okay, Pee Wee, this is Tammy and this is Sasha. How are you ladies doing? Let me ask y'all, ( stammers do... do y'all kn-know... know... What a menage-a-trois is? Well, how about... About just a foursome? Well h-how about... How about an orgy? L-look here, let me ask you a question. - Have you ever did it to two men at once? - Please. What about one man at two? It's a quarter till. Hi, Mrs. Farrell. Hello, Kool. - Hey, Kool. - How are you doing, Mr. Farrell? Go ahead, Kool, ask her. Ask me what? Well, I was kind of thinking that... Yes, Kool, you can have some food. It's Kool's birthday next week and he and his friends are gonna go to Vegas. No. You are not taking my daughter to Sin City. Mrs. Farrell, I was just thinking it could be a going-away present for her. Since we're not gonna see each other for a while, I was hoping that... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Back it up, okay? If you really want to give her a present, the first-semester schoolbooks are about $600. Why, Kool, you can pick the tab up for that. Dad, you have some input in this. Say something. Yeah, well, I think that we sh... It... it doesn't seem... You don't want to sleep on the couch tonight. What happened to the big talk we just had about compromising, Mom? I am compromising. Okay, Kool, you can take her to a museum. To a mu...? You said he was an artist. Your mom is mean, man. Say, Harold, how about some of those baby back ribs, man? Aw, man, you ate up half the pig already. - This is my last time. - Damn. I promise. Dawg, let me get some potato salad. - You know I got you, baby. - Good looking out. Where are you going when you leave here? Man, we need to get a hotel room, me and you go do something, you know what I'm saying? - Shit. - You with that? - All these hos? - For sure, for sure. Young Joe Dawg. - What's up with you, baby? - Nothing. - What are you drinking? - Some Kool-Aid. You want some? - No, thanks. - Christopher, now, you know only grown folks drink in my house. Sorry, Auntie. Man, Joe, you're gonna get us caught, man. Let's get up out of here. Watch out for the lawman. What's up, dawg? How's the policing business going, baby? Saint, what the hell are you doing here? What am I doing here? This is a neighborhood barbecue, ain't it? Everyone is invited. You know something, nigga? I remember back in the day we used to be friends, boy. You must have me confused with someone else, Saint, 'cause you and I were never friends. Why are you trying to embarrass me in front of my girls, man? Fake K-Mart, rent-a-cop motherfucker. Yeah, I'll catch you later, Saint. Remember, in a fight, as in life, you've got to have the courage and the discipline to go with the energy, not against it. - Are you all right? - Yes, sir. Because if you go against the energy, you might wind up living on the dark side. Remember, respect all and fear none. - Okay? Any questions? - No, sir. Salute. Thank you. Before we close today, I have a very special promotion. Kool, right here. Okay, down. Everybody down with us. Your father and I grew up in this art. We got our black belts on the same day from Mr. Parker. This is a very special moment. Thank you. In Kenpo, when a brown belt becomes a black belt, a boy becomes a man. Today you're a man. I know how proud your father would be. This was also a gift from Mr. Parker to your father many, many years ago. I think it's time you had it. Bow and touch your forehead to the belt and pick it up.

Where can I find him at? - That's him right there. - Thanks, Eddy. - Officer Tully. - Yeah? - I need to talk to you. - Make an appointment. - I need to talk to you now. - I don't have the time. - It's important, though. - I don't have the time, son. - What do you mean, you don't have time? - You make the appointment or you'll get in trouble here. Goodbye. Somebody tell me what the fuck's going on. Detective Division. Hold, please. Ma'am, I'm here to see Detective Tully. - Do you have an appointment? - No, but I just seen him. He told me to come down here. - Okay, well, have a seat. I'll tell him. - I'm here to see my girl. She don't belong in there. She didn't do this. You need to have a seat. Okay? I can't believe this shit. If you don't have evidence, you don't have a case. Call me back when you got something to say. Jiminy, I can't believe it. Come in. Sorry to bother you, sir. There's someone here to see you. Do they have an appointment? No, sir, but she's insisting on seeing the officer in charge and I think you might want to see this girl. Okay, send her in. - Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. - My pleasure. Hi. Look, okay, I got charged with prostitution, but it's not what it sounds like. I'm not a prostitute. I went to a bachelor party to do a dance, and that's all I did. I'm actually a college student. And I went in there and I danced around and the guys... Did you have sex with any of the men there? No, I didn't have sex with any... I did nothing. Let me show you what I did. This is all I did. I walked up to the guys. I mean, they sat around... This is while you're dancing? Yeah, at a bachelor party, you know, like this. What else did you do? Well, I took my top off. Topless in the face. And I do this thing with a dollar, and that's when they arrested me. What is that? I put a dollar right there. There? There, and I... I take it like this. Okay, okay, okay, that's good. Okay, zip up. I'm gonna give you my card. I want you to call this number after midnight - and we'll have an interview, okay? - All right. - It's really important. - I know it is. - Okay. - What's your name? - I'm Roxanne. - Roxanne, take care of yourself. - And get a shirt. - Okay, thank you. - Cover that up. - I really appreciate it. Thank you. The pleasure is mine. Man, I've been here for over an hour. Did you tell him I was here? Yes, I told him. And he'll get to you when he's ready. - Please sit down. - That's bullshit. I gotta go see him now. Where you going? You're not allowed back there. Wait a minute. I've been waiting for two hours out here. When the hell are you gonna help me? - Sorry, sir. - You told me to make an appointment and I made one. - Come outside. - Get this idiot out of here. Man, Tully, my girlfriend is innocent. Just tell me what I gotta do. I'll do anything. - What's your girl's name? - LaShawna... LaShawna Farrell. - Come on, let's go. - Let him go. You gonna be all right, sir? I'll be fine. Have a seat. - So that's your girl? - Yeah. It'd be a shame to see all that prettiness get raped away in some penitentiary up north. - My girl didn't kill nobody. - I don't know that. The only thing I know is two things... One is what my men saw in the alley. - What's two? - Instincts. - Instincts? - Yeah. I have a feeling there's someone new in town that might be behind this pile of shit that you find your girl and you standing in. - I could be wrong. - But what if you're right? Then your girl goes free. Then why don't you just go bust his ass? You got all these cops here. Take your men and just go bust their ass. That's good. Why didn't I think of that? Problem is, I don't have enough evidence to pin murder on him. Just instincts, and they're never wrong. - Never? - Never. I need to find somebody to get down with his crew so the crew will trust him. Do you know who that someone might be? What's their name? Saint. Saint? - Ring a bell? - Yeah, I've seen him before and I don't think you want to fuck with him.

LaShawna, me, our child... The future looked so good. Now I'm on a dead-end path, a crash course for destiny. Funny... when you're 38 feet below, all the guns and the money in the world don't even matter much. You find yourself thinking about the strangest things. I found myself thinking a lot about justice and realized I had never found any for myself. I had just been sinking deeper and deeper. And now all I wondered is if I had enough air to get away. And if I did get away, did I have anything to live for anymore? Eventually they found me and I found myself locked in jail for 30 years without parole until Eddy got me off on some legal loophole after only serving five years. He gave me a second chance to live a good life... The life my girl and my child would approve of. I'll always be true to you, baby. What'd you wish for? - Is Kool here yet? - Yeah, Kool is here. He's in the backyard with his gangster rapper buddies. - Mom, he is not a gangster. - He's not? Then what is he? - He's an artist. - He's an artist? - So you're writing a new song? - Yeah. - And guess what it's called. - What? "LaShawna's Groove." - I want to hear it. - No, you can't hear it. - Why not? - Um-um. When the time is right. - Yeah. - I swear, baby, it's the bomb. - Hello, Kool. - Hi, Mrs. Farrell. It's Kool's birthday next week and he and his friends are gonna go to Vegas. You're not taking my daughter to Sin City. Mrs. Farrell, I was thinking it could be a going-away present for her. I mean, since we're not gonna see each other for a while... I don't need nothing but you, Kool. But I want to get us out of here, man.
