Help! Help! Sister, run! Hurry up! Sister, hurry up! I think Cambodia will soon be lost. The Communists are coming to town soon. Follow me to Thailand with your family. Thank you, if I leave, no one will farm the land. Don't be silly, when you reach Thailand, you won't be jobless. Even the Communists rule over Cambodia, every government needs food. They need farmers for cultivations too. I will be fine, don't worry. Daddy... What's the matter? I am scared! There is a corpse in the field. Where? Over there. Yan, many people will be killed in war time. He died terribly! Dead people won't have any feeling. Only the living people will be suffering! Shang, it's time for you to go now. Wah, sister-in-law, take care. You too. Say goodbye to Uncle Shang. Goodbye, Uncle Shang. Goodbye. Shang, take care. Take care! Close the window, be quick. Daddy... Run! It hurts! Where? Blood... Run! Hurry up! Come on. Yan, hurry up. Yan, remember. No matter what's happening, don't come out, got it? Yes. Don't let your sister say a word. Yes. What's the matter? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Wah. Brother Lui, what's the matter? Where is the document? What? The document for the CIA! Ray, you betrayed us, you will deserve it. Where is the document? Where is it? In the basement. Go. Where are your son and daughter? Brother Ray, don't hurt them. I will kill you. Let's go. Mom. Dad. Sister, come out now, come out. You will be burnt! Sister, come out! Come out. You will be burnt! Sister, come out. Uncle Shang. Uncle Shang... Where are your parents? They are all dead. How about your sister? (20 Years Later, Thailand) Basin tower, this is Cobra flight leader.

Yan, pull up now, this is an order. Radio, any contact? Roger, positive contact. You know what would be happened... if you didn't pull up on time? It must be the newspaper which drove you mad. I tell you, don't tell Uncle Shang that I've read the news. Dad, this bastard drove Yan crazy this day. It's true, I didn't lie to you. Yan, what do you want? I've been waiting for 20 years. Things are different now! He is now a billionaire in Hong Kong. His investment in Thailand is over 100 millions. He is the buddy of the Commander of Thailand. It's not easy to kill him. I know how he got rich. From smuggled arms. We are soldiers. We have to kill him in a lawful way. My parents were killed, you wouldn't have any feeling! Why not? Your dad was my buddy! Don't you think I haven't thought of taking revenge? You have bright future, if you take revenge, you may have to pay great price. I am the only son of your buddy. I have no choice. In my life, there is only one target. For that jerk? Nothing else? Yan. Yan has grown up now. Why do you follow me? This is the order from my boss, I am sorry. I have to kill Ray Lui. If you love telling uncle Shang, just go ahead. Don't follow me! You got better ones? Don't worry! Even old, can kill. Lito Lito. Damn it! Do you want flowers? I'm sorry. How much? One dollar. Thank you. Welcome. This is for you. My driver. How much is the mango? $500! $5007? I am local people. $250 will be too much for you. Don't cheat so much. This is my treat. Nice place. I am ready. Mark We have practised shooting together. You must let me join you this time. Wear this. Don't let others recognise you. Here comes the general. Stay calm. Give way... Stay back, stay a bit back, OK? Thank you. Ray, who is that girl? If you like her, I will ask her to stay with you tonight. Ray, you've got better taste! I learn that from you. Mr. Lui, can you say something about the investment plan? In fact, I'd thank the general to donate this piece of land, to build this school. And I hope to take this chance... to educate more elites for the society. Don't move. When can we leave? Shut up! The scene is sealed now, no one can leave here. Leave at once! Everyone stays back! Shut up! Stay back. Miss, don't block the way, I have to go up for my son. Sorry, sorry... I saw a man pointing at a woman with his gun. What's next then? She is scared to... Did he shoot? Well... he didn't. Have you seen... This way. Why do you save me? Why didn't you shoot because of me? If you killed him, I would appreciate it very much. What's the relationship between you and Ray? I am some kind of decoration for him. I can't imagine that I could be used to stop the bullet. I worry that... If you are seen to save me... I don't hope so. You are seriously hurt. I will get you the medicine. Can you help me... to look for my friend? The one who came with me. Speak up! Who are you? Luckily I am saved. Take this for evidence! Go out. Drag him out. Get up! Who told you to kill me? Speak up! I will let you live. If I shoot from here. One of your eyes will go blind, but you won't be killed. Are you talking or not? Speak up! I will tell you... the hell! It's proved that, the assassinator who committed suicide is a soldier. Another gunman is in fugitive. Where have you been? The hotel is all a mess. The cops didn't allow me to come back, so I went to the shopping mall. I sent many people to look for you, I thought you were killed! Massage for me. Dog, be a bit smart. I was lucky this time, but I may not be that lucky again! Mr. Lui, don't worry, it won't happen again. Keep an eye on those rubbish! They just know spending my money! I know, I am leaving now. What's up? Am I dirty? You saved my life! Buy any jewelry you like in Hong Kong. Don't you know your manner? Thank you. You have to leave Thailand at once. They will come here any time! I can't let Mark die like this. Ray Lui is so powerful that, he will kill you! Now, you can only go to America to work for the CIA. They can protect you. What are you talking about? I haven't told you one thing. While we were in Cambodia, Ray Lui, your father and I... worked for the CIA to collect information. Later, Ray Lui betrayed us. It's known by your dad, so he killed your whole family. Daddy... There are many soldiers out there. Don't panic. Let me handle it. Because of our relationship, the CIA will take care of you. By the way, they always want to terminate Ray Lui. You are useful to them. I can't drag you down. Freeze. If you want to help me, leave here right now. - Uncle Shang. - My son died. I don't want you to die too. Don't worry, I will be fine. Sir, about the shooting incident in the hotel this afternoon. We want to talk to you. OK. This way sir. (San Francisco, USA) Her name is Crystal, Ray Lui's only daughter. She has been in San Francisco for 5 years and has not been back to Hong Kong since. There seem to be some problems between them. Nick. This is Nick, Crystal's boyfriend, they have been living together for one year, both of them are Art students. Crystal, you must be interested to know something... about your boyfriend Nick. Don't be nosy, or I won't give you good time! Take it easy. Look at the pictures first! Who is she? You are cheated, you know? This is Nick's wife. What did you say? This scumbag Nick, married with this women in Alabama three years ago. Only you fall deeply for him! And this is their marriage cert. Which I copied from the City Hall. Take a look. Your daddy said, no matter you are staying with whom, he just worries that you would be cheated. Bastard! All are bastards! Miss, don't be that angry. Is my dad angry? Sure, he is mad! I feel better then. In fact, Ray Lui loves her so much. I don't care what she's up to, I only care about Uncle Shang. Don't worry, CIA will take care of him. You shouldn't feel sad for that scumbag, right? Why the hell we're watching over his daughter only? Why? To get Ray Lui, you have to get her first! She's the key of the old man. Hi, Crystal. Get lost. You shouldn't feel sad for that guy, it doesn't worth! Why don't you take any action then? I am bullied, why are you still sitting here? You nuts! Nuts! Take action now! I don't want to see him again. You will never see him again. Don't let anyone be killed. Sure! Don't worry. Don't follow me. Ray Lui has screwed too many girls. Who knows the revenge is on his daughter. Something has happened. Bastard! Crystal, run! Go ahead, try it. Let me go. Uncle Tung... Should we do something? No! Just wait. What's up? Help! Blackie! What the hell do you want?! I want you... Uncle Tung... Help... help. The Black Tiger gang finally makes their move, well, it's our chance. I want to take you to see Uncle Nine. Who's that guy? The dragonhead of Hwa Fuk Tong The CIA and Hwa Fuk Tong are just like brothers. You have something you need, speak! It's very simple, his name will be Mandy, he's your grandson. Mandy spent most of his life in Holland, selling heroin. We'll provide a spectacular criminal background for him. And on your 80th birthday celebration, you'll announce to everyone that Mandy will be the new boss of Hwa Fuk Tong. How can they trust a young kid? But they will trust a kid who is capable. My first job is... to ruin the headquarters of the Black Tigers. And then, get Ray Lui's daughter. I see, you want Ray Lui! Uncle Nine. Let's see what we will get first. We are good friends, we shouldn't talk about money, right? If there is no money, who will be your friend? One million dollars or no deal. Deal! You dirty old man! But you better make damn sure that Mandy is the hottest boss of China Town. How are you? You don't seem to be happy with the new boss! This is the idea of Uncle Nine, we are juniors, we'd accept it. Right! You know what are you talking about? Do you understand that I have your daughter? Give me the money you owe me, otherwise she will be cheaper than a whore. There are niggers waiting to fuck her. Using my daughter to blackmail me? Don't even think about that. You want money, you give me a good reason. But I don't pay for your own screw. I think you just won't cry until you see a dead body. What do you want? Listen Blackie, you listen good. I don't kow-tou to nobody, not even for my own daughter. Nobody fucking move. Sit there. Don't move! Stay back. Hwa Fuk Boys, what are you guys doing here? And who the hell is this guy? My new boss. So you are Blackie? The boss of the black tigers, right? You don't even know me, you're not going to last too long in China Town. You better listen carefully, from now on, Hwa Fuk Tong is going to control whole San Francisco. If you want to get a part, we'll welcome you to join us. Fuck off! Move back. Get up! Back! Sit down! None of my business! I am kidnapped! Let me go. Thank you. Take her away. Yes. Let them go. Your boss's just got the shit out of here. So get the fuck out of here. Go! Come on. Moving, let's go, hurry up. Hurry up! The cops are coming! What the hell is going on here? Stop! Mandy, police. - Help! - Don't move! Or I will shoot! Get the car. What do you want? If you make any noise, I will beat you to shit! Good show. Don't you see my boys may get hurt? Just routine, happens everyday! You just know playing but not watching the cow! I will kill you. I wanna beat you to death! Stop! Stop beating... Yan, run. Don't cry, eat a candy, and you will be alright. Brother, don't cry, eat a candy, you'll be alright. Bastard, if the cow doesn't help us farming, we'll be starve to death! It's feeding us indirectly, you'd take it as your family. Got it? Yes. Better watch it carefully. Stop looking, I don't have anything special. You've taken all the advantages. This is my style. Take her inside. Don't move! Come on baby, relax. You pig! Mandy I did it, so what? Don't you think you have many lives? Just one is enough. Don't stay here, go out to do the cooking. Stop bluffing! I won't be scared. Hello. Wait. Mr. Lui, a guy called Mandy from Wah Fuk Tong is on the phone. Are you Ray Lui? Speaking. Is my daughter with you? Yes. You have guts to ruin the place of Black Tigers, you are something! But, if there is anything happened to my daughter, I want your whole family dead! How is my daughter? Crystal Crystal, how are you? I am still alive. But I won't guarantee in near future. Don't worry, daddy won't let them do anything to you. Because of you, that's why I am kidnapped. Crystal Your father did many wrong things before, but, we may not be father and daughter in our next life, why not give daddy a chance? I will give you chance. Prepare a million US dollars to redeem your daughter. Take 50 thousand more. I want to eat better. Now, there is a little change. Make it $1.05 million. Deal. Aren't you pretending to be cool out there? Why are you here? Can't you see a hidden door here? Give me the phone. I am taking the towel for a bath only. What are you doing? Pretending to be cool? No one is living nearby. If you want to go to the city, you have to walk at least one day. I am not leaving. I come out to tell you that, there isn't any hidden door inside. Go back then. I want a shower! Don't come in. There is a car coming, something weird, go prepare it. Scumbag, tell your boss to get his ass out of here. Come out. I haven't wore anything! Mandy, go! Take him away! Go! Take off your clothes for me! What are you looking? Climb up. They are shooting! Lay on the floor! You go first. Run, Mandy! Come down! No way. Be careful! Come on. God damn you! Be careful. Blackie... are you alright? Where are they? Their car went down the hill! Get them! I want them killed! Go and get them! Don't let them go! I want them dead! They have gone! How are you? I am thinking of eating hot pot, it'll make me feel warmer. Run with me. It'll make you warm, come on. I am eating hot food, shut up! Come on! Let's run to the town, I will take you to eat Thai food. How about shark fins? Let's go. No way, let me take a rest. Mom said, the heaven likes taking pictures for us with the flash. All mothers love lying. When I was small, my mom told me, if you feel pain, eat a candy, then you will be alright. For the picture just been taken, I closed my eyes. I haven't felt such feeling for a long time. What kind of feeling? Cold. [t can be cured. Eat more hot pots. Look. I think this will be quite handsome. UFO! UFO! This will make you feel better. Take some aspirin. Thank you. This isn't a very safe area. I'm glad you two weren't hurt. I'll let you know when we get to the city. You just relax right now. Great! Thanks. I wish I have a companion like this when I am old. What are you looking? I have watched you for a while, I can't find any similarities between you and your dad. Don't mention about him. I hate him. When my mom committed suicide, he was next to her. But he didn't stop her. I came to San Francisco in order not to see him. But, I really miss him. I hate myself. For I always do something to make him angry. In fact, in this world how many people can do whatever they like? Sometimes, they have got no choice. Mr. Lui, he is here. How many people are following? Just one alone. Search him. How dare you? If you don't welcome me, I'd better leave. Don't move. Stop! Nothing is found. Don't move. Shoot me. Come on. Shoot me! Do you want the girl? Dog. What a disgusting name! Kid, don't you think you are great for selling heroin in Holland? You become a little boss here, so you think you can pick on me! Stop such nonsense! Money please. Count carefully. We are adults, I don't think you will cheat me. Why do you stay so close? Do you want tips? Leave me alone. Where is my daughter? I will let her go right after getting the money. Hold it. You are a stranger here, you should be informed that, the whole San Francisco... is under Wah Fuk Tong's control. If you want to do any business with anybody, better tell me first, I don't want my buddies... to bother you. What's that shit? I've heard that... your men were severely beaten by Black Tigers. Don't watch with your ears! Try to look with your eyes. Thank you. Blackie. Why are you so late? How is my dad? Why are you concerning about him? I am just asking whether he is dead or not. This is yours, $50,000. Was my dad angry when he gave you money? He got a long face. Let's celebrate for it. I blackmailed your dad, why are you so happy? Take out again? That's Thai food. What's this? Beef. I don't eat beef. No? Never mind. Something better for you. What? The rice I cooked. Damn it! No foul language. Sorry. Don't move! Go. Brother Dog. Run! - Damn you! - No! Brother Dog. How dare you pull off a stunt! No shooting! Crystal, run. Daddy, no shooting! Daddy, don't kill him! He is my husband. How dare you screw my daughter? No, he saved me, he is so nice to me! He blackmailed me! It's easy for you to make money, $1.05 million is nothing to you. I do want to know that, how can you make my daughter... concern about my money? Have you eaten the rice she cooked? I do. It's not done yet. Are you sure about him? Anyway, just don't bother him, that's it. Or, won't let you go. I will listen to you. You are really something! You made my daughter so obedient! But... if you want to co-operate with me, that's not a problem, but don't fool my girl. Not enough water, baby. Daddy is waiting for you out there. If you want to take him home for eating your food, think carefully, then tell me. How is it? What? Are you pretending? How should I tell my daddy? You may tell him that, the rice is not yet done, you need time to cook it again. Damn it. I'll feel like an asshole to use her like this. After her moo's death, she hasn't had any good day. Just when things are getting better. I'm not going to screw her up again. You have no choice. Ray Lui is planning for another arm shipment to Cambodia. For the betrayer Buboei. We need you to get close to Ray Lui, so as to destroy him. This is our aim. I know! Who care about that? I just want to kill Ray Lui, but not his daughter. You got this? This is an order. You'll have to choose between Crystal and treason. (Hong Kong) What's up? Why don't you ask us to take the pictures? Help yourself. Congratulations. Come earlier. Enjoy yourself. Don't be that angry. Crystal, do you want to break it? That machine is out of order, I can't get even a coin! Alright, I'll ask someone to fix it, SO you can get the money easily. That's good. Serve the guests. I don't know them at all. Where is Mandy? He may be gambling now. Enjoy yourself. Daddy, hurry up. What's the matter? Are you fooling me? What's up? Why did you hug Crystal so tightly... in front of me? Today is my wedding, she is my wife, what's wrong? You just want to kill Ray, why do you marry his daughter? Yan, I can't stand Ray anymore. Mona, if you can't stand him, you'd better leave him. Will he let me go? I know too many things about him. You will save me, right? I think, you'd better forget our past. What did you say? Don't remember what happened in the past. Mandy Are you chatting? Daddy is looking for you. Let's chat later. I have sound memory. Should I tell Ray everything? Up to you. For something, if you disclose it, you won't get any advantage. See you later. Why is daddy looking for me? Crystal, I have something to talk to Mandy. Don't teach him something bad. Enjoy yourself. Mr. Lui. - Mr. Lui. - What's the matter? She was beaten by Mr. Lam. Where is Mr. Lam? In the room. Lam, I am Ray. Sorry, it's useless to be wealthy in Hong Kong. If such girl was living in Cambodia, I would have killed her by one shot. This is Major Bodar. Son of General Buboei. My son-in-law, Mandy. Uncle always praises you in front of me. I have much more things to learn. We are friends for years. Because of his identity, we seldom see each other. I want you to liaise more with Major, just like buddies. Great. Today is your wedding, take the gift. Mandy, he is using the name Lam Chung to cover his identity. This secret is just... between you and me. So, you have to keep the secret. Alright, if someone is around, I will call him Brother Chung. Why not let me show you around tonight? No, you'd better keep your wife company tonight. Uncle will take me out for fun. "The 7 dwarfs and Snow White..." This place is booked by us. Please go out. Brother Dog, they are from the Political Department. No more music! Show me your I.D. card. Police, all sit down and show me your I.D. card. Mr. Lui, they are from the Political Department. Please take out your I.D. card. I.D. card. Sir. Are you Mr. Lam? Please follow us to the police station. - Take him back. - Yes. Please co-operate with us. Get lost! Or I will shoot him to death. Let him go! Officer Cheng. Officer Cheng. Call the ambulance. Ask Mandy to come here. What's the matter? Mr. Lui wants to see you. What's up? Nothing, go on sleeping. Wait for me. Daddy. What's the matter? The Political Department came to arrest Bodar. He wanted to escape, so he was shot to death. Why the police knew his whereabout? Daddy, are you suspecting me? Did you get drunk and leak out the secret? I am not a kid. Don't you trust me? Daddy, I am your son-in-law! What advantage will I get if I disclose his identity? I haven't any advantage at all. I don't mean it. Now, General Buboei's son is dead. If my daughter is killed, what'll I do? I will Kill! I know, but this is not our fault! We just explain it to General Buboei. How? He is not killed by us, what are you afraid of? Daddy, I will go to Cambodia with you to look for Buboei. It's lucky that you will be with me. Go and accompany Crystal. Don't worry, good night. When the arms are delivered to General Buboei. I will be there too. At least he won't blame me. Ray, it's dangerous to go alone. I know it too. If I don't go, he will send a troop to kill me. Just ask a small potato to admit the fault. It's useless to send a troop of small potatoes there. I don't even have enough confidence to go alone. If you can't give him a satisfactory explanation, what'll you do? That's why I want Mandy to go, to be my scapegoat. It may not be related with Mandy. Well... He is unlucky then! Better let him be the scapegoat. Now, I use my son-in-law to pay for his son's life, he should be happier. And I have to collect the money for the arms. Bodar's death isn't a matter. Ray Lui's death isn't a matter too. Most important of all, we have to terminate Buboei. To keep peace in Cambodia. That will save many lives of the civilians. Are you alright. You know I've married with his daughter, don't you? I know, it's just a fake. Be a man! Think big! This is the head of the baby. This is body. Isn't it a baby boy or girl? You won't know it that soon. You will know it... after the baby is 28 weeks old. What's wrong with you? Nothing. It's the heartbeat of the baby. Sorry. Hello. I am going to make a call, sorry. Let's talk now. Crystal is staying with me now, no way. Thank you. Do you know where? I've arranged that, take the key, that's it. How is it? We may go after taking the medicine! I have something to do, just take the taxi home yourself. But I am pregnant. I will get the medicine for you. Miss, please. Medicine. I've booked a room. May I know your name? Mandy Chan Room 1804 please. Your friend is waiting for you now. Thank you. You're welcome. Can't we talk on the phone? Let's take a seat and drink first. No, what's the matter? I want to tell you that I just want money from Ray Lui. I've got it, but I am not happy. You have to pay for it. Now, I don't want money. I want freedom. But he won't let me go. He will kill me. Sorry, I can't help you. I intended to go to Cambodia with you and Ray, since I want to see how you will be killed. Bodar is dead now. Ray Lui wants you to be the scapegoat. Are you clear? I don't want you to be killed. You just want to kill Ray Lui. Now, you can do it. This is good to both of us. I have money, after killing him, we can run away. Why do you want to escape from me? If you really want to escape from me, you won't come at all. No one dares to touch Ray Lui's woman. Except you. I won't forget the day we stayed in the boilers' room. - Hello? - Mr. Chan, a lady said she is your wife... Where is she now? She left. What's the matter? Crystal may be here. Mona Who are you looking for? Is Mandy there? Look for yourself. Sorry. You shouldn't screw my dad's woman! You can't go. Mandy, if she leaves, we will be in trouble too. Get lost, you bitch! That's good. I am glad she is dead, so she won't bother you again. Die now! Mona, please don't. Listen to me, if she doesn't die, we will be killed! So, we can stay together! No... You leave now! Go! Stop saying. I tell you, I don't want to see you again! Never! Listen to me. Open the door, open the door! She lost too much blood and with Tachypnea. Blood pressure is too low, just 80/40. Inform the hospital to prepare for blood transfusion. Give way... Give way. Dr. Lui, the patient needs blood transfusion now. The woman you mentioned in the hotel, how can we find her? Sorry, I don't mean it. How can we get the lady? Where is Crystal? She is now in the operation room. How come? What's wrong with you? Mister, who are you? I am the patient's father. Let's talk over there. From the statement, your son-in-law was hooking but seen by his wife. So, they fought and your daughter's head got hurt. We may sue him. You shouldn't beaten her severely! Mister, she won't wake up soon. Come to see her tomorrow. Take good care of her please. Sure we will do it. We can't change our flight to Cambodia, don't worry. The hospital will take good care of her. Don't worry too. I will be in the airport tomorrow. Go back first, I want to stay with Crystal. I have no time. Wake up now. I have many things to talk to you. How is your wife? She is fine. What's up? Take this with you when you reach Cambodia. When Buboei appears, press this button. We will send assistance to you soon. This mission is a very dangerous one, take care. Don't worry. No matter live or dead, I will pay what I owed you. We just do that for Cambodia. I am not as great as you! I don't want to go to Cambodia, but I have to. I don't want to take this mission. But I won't say no. I don't want my friend to die for me. But... Mark! I wanted to save my sister. But I killed her with my own hands. Now, I've found... a woman who can live with me for the rest of our lives, but I have to do one thing, that she will never forgive me. She will never forgive me! I want to kill her dad. Don't I have any choice? Don't I have any choice? I have to go now. Although you haven't waken up yet, I hope you to listen to my words. I am not a Thai. I am not a boss of Hwa Fuk Tong. I am a Cambodian. 20 years ago, your daddy killed my parents. I am here to take revenge. But I made a wrong decision. I shouldn't marry with you. Please forgive me. Your daddy and I have to go to Cambodia now. Among us... Only one can come back, if I die, you won't see me anymore. If I don't, you don't want to see me anymore. You have my baby. Take care. I haven't told you that, I am not called Mandy. My name is Wai Lok-yan. Promise me. Don't kill my daddy with your own hands. (Cambodia) Is the place beautiful? Yes, nice place, but the people are poor. Don't you think that all can earn money... with a pretty face like you? Most important of all is to find a rich boss. Right? It's poor for them to make a wrong choice! The helicopter is now 50 kilometers north of Chungchi. According to the route they are heading to, the destination may be Samrong, the zone under Buboei's control. Sir, we've got information that, the information centre we have set up is ruined by Buboei's army. And they moved all the documents away. Very good, our plan is undergoing smoothly. Guess what will Buboei react... after seeing the documents? I just worry about Mandy, hope he can escape! Major Lee, long time no see. Mr Lui, you come with me. You come with me. The rest of you stay here. Dog, be smart. According to the estimated location, they are staying here, 120 kilometers away from Samrong. Our troops are gathered in this zone, we just need 10 minutes for the air force to reach there. We are just waiting for the appearance of Buboei. If he doesn't show up, what'll we do next? I think you have to set a time limit, no matter the red light is lit or not, we should set out. General, this place is so beautiful. Ray My son is a well experienced soldier, nothing had happened to him during the wars. I couldn't imagine that a visit to Hong Kong... I am so sad about Major's death. It's just like my son's death. In fact, this tragedy was created by my son-in-law, so I brought him here to let you handle it. Go, go... Before you come, my soldiers had ruined an information centre. They got these files. This asshole is a soldier! And... General, this is fake! This is fake! Ray Lui, do you want to pull off a stunt here? General, no! Take them for execution! Yes sir. General, if I want to betray you, why am I here to let you kill me? Don't you forget you worked for the CIA before 20 years ago? - Move along together! - Move! Search them. What's matter? Stay back. - Hands up! - Stop it. Report, we lost the contact with them. How about the sound wave signal? It's stopped, sir. There must be an accident, let's set out now. Stay calm and watch over it. We have no time! Hurry up. Hurry up. All of them, move move. Hands off me! Betrayer! You worked for the Americans! What did you say? Dog, kill him for me. Let them go. Let them fight among themselves. General, I have been dealing business with you for so many years, what benefits will I get to betray you? Give me the gun, I will kill this betrayer to show my loyalty! Dog, give way, let me Kill him. Ray, please let him alive! You bitch! You wanted to kill Crystal in the motel, I know it already! Come on, are you hurt? Airplanes of the air force are coming! You trick me to show up and want me... Don't move! Ladies & gentlemen, stay back, stay back! Stay back! Mr. Lui, come here. Stay back! Go. Get in! Mr. Lui, move quickly! Government troops are coming. Will you give me better comments? Sorry. When will we get to Thailand boundary? Speak up. We need one more hour! Ray, you can't reach Thailand without me. They may be waiting for you. Are you threatening me? Why are you still so cocky? Those are the airplanes of the gov't air force. Let's hide up inside the forest. Mr. Lui, watch ahead. Be careful. Throw him down the car now. There are machine guns at the back, let's fight with them. Hit it down! I didn't do anything to harm you, why do you want to kill me? 20 years ago, you killed my parents in Cambodia, forgotten? Oh, you are... Don't kill me! I beg you, don't kill me. For Crystal's sake. For my daughter's sake, don't kill me. Don't kill me... Don't kill an old man... just hand me to the army please. Son, remember, if the cow doesn't farm for us, we will have nothing to eat. It feeds us indirectly. You have to treat it like your family member, got it? Yes. Uncle Shang, I've got the picture you sent me. I am happy to see Crystal and my son. I don't know when I can hug my own baby... and stay with Crystal... Please tell Crystal that I've been suffered from memories for 20 years. I don't want her to copy me. Yesterday, I went to see the field which was burnt. Now, it becomes a green green field. It's like the one when I was small. I do hope that my family can appreciate it with me. Uncle Shang. This is your son. Crystal said this is your son too. She has no reason to stop you from seeing him. Just take a look. This is the first letter that she gave you. Mandy is over. Wai Lok Yan is still a stranger to me. Give me more time to understand him. If there is any problem with the kid, contact me directly. Take care!
