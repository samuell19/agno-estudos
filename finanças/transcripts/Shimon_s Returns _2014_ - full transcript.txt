What is important to me? I hope and I believe that I'm a human being. That's the first thing I believe in. To be a human being. It is important for me to tell my personal story since it exemplifies a few aspects of the Holocaust. And the pre Holocaust and post Holocaust. Which are not usually shared. And I would say that this is a rather positive message. That what happened and what prevails until today are not only the bad aspects of human nature. But also that there is some good within and among people. There is no question that my happy childhood years have a strong effect on my whole outlook. These years make me strong and feel good until this very day. Children born to Jewish middle class families in the 1930s in Eastern Galicia. Parents, families tended to raise them as Jews. But culturally and linguistically this was Polish language and Polish country. All these rhymes I remember for years, and years, and years. In spite of all the bad things, tragedies, Holocaust and so on. We led some sort of a normal children's life. Helenevej it was one of the best known Jewish children's homes in Poland in the post war years. I was not a regular dweller of Helenevej but I did spend there one summer. Get out! Another memory of Helenevej is being filmed, being filmed in Helenevej for Unzere Kinder, the Yiddish speaking film in which the main characters were the very popular then and later, Dzingan and Schumacher. ♪ My mom is my lily to read ♪ What is quite unusual, and I thought about it only decades later is that although I was acting as a child survivor, I never, never connected between my real Holocaust story and the scenario which I was given for Unzere Kinder. Only much later on I started to confront my real Holocaust years when the scenario which I was acting. I was born in Lviv, what used to be Polish Eastern Galicia, but first 10 years of my life, I lived 'bout 90 kilometers from Lviv. Most of my family did not survive the war. We had a big family, relatives, my father did not survive. My grandparents on both sides didn't survive. My father's remains are located somewhere in a mass grave, which I'm not sure exactly where it is located. But that's where hundreds and hundreds of Berezhany Jews were executed. And I think this street is one of the ghetto streets which used to be. Just a minute, let me try to locate. Don't miss right there. I made a mistake, I made a mistake. It was an excellent hiding place. We were never discovered. But the problem of course was food. And one of the first nights my mother and my Grandpa Fishel went during the middle of the night to a family friend, a Polish family by the name of Stanislaw Codogni, and the son Harold. The Codogni's opened the door and gave them a sack full of food. And that was taking place for six months. They used to go to the Codogni's take food, and then go back again, and that's how we got our food in that hiding place. I don't know. And I remember looking out into the market place, very nearby. And I saw people walking, but I was removed from them by like light years. I was living in a completely different world. They were living in a normal world, I was living in a world, everyday we were reminded that we may be discovered and executed. Once a family moved into that house that we had a hiding place in the affluent ghetto of Berezhany. And we couldn't stay there anymore, and that's when we moved to a hiding place in a nearby village of Raj. Which means paradise. And there we were saved by a Ukrainian peasant woman with two small children, who's husband was taken for compulsory work inside Germany. Her name was Danke Kontsevich. And there we stayed with my uncle and my aunt until the summer of 1944. So when I come back to Berezhany I do not come only to the place where my father was executed. But I'm also always visiting the Ukrainian family which saved me, and that makes a tremendous difference. Ania was about nine, nine and a half years old. And they lived here Tanka, Tanka was alone with two children because her husband was deported to Germany for labor. As we were hiding on the roof in the house that was standing on that spot exactly, she was completely alone. And sadly come two German soldiers because there was a German camp not far from here. And they tell her that they need hay. And they put the ladder at the entrance to the attic, to the And she pulls them by the pants and they continue climbing on it, so she at nine years old, she pushes that ladder so that they couldn't go up. And she starts crying. And she starts crying and yelling, wait until my mother comes, wait until my mother comes. And in a few minutes her mother comes. So Tanka didn't close her nerve. She was a very clever and fast woman. She went up on the attic, on the ladder, and there was there so she took one and threw it to the German soldiers, and one on us. So that after a few minutes the Germans had the hay. And we were covered all with the cash. With the. And then the two German soldiers left. Do you remember it? I remember hardly, she remembers better. She was a year or two older than me. And since then her mother told her to close the door, and don't let anybody in. And because of that besides Tanka getting the Righteous Gentile medal, also Ania for herself received, although usually they don't give the to children less than 12 years old when things happened. She was nine, but she still got it. First of all we found the old maps. And areas of 1944. From there we could learn how big the cemetery was. Next to the cemetery I found a mass grave. Okay let me. Because when they jump it shows it body by body, body by body laid it there. They come together, yes it was moving. Right. If the place where we are standing is really the mass grave of the last Jews of the Berezhany Ghetto when the last liquidation action took place. Exactly like now in June, 1943. If this is the mass grave then this is the place where my father was killed. I remember when they started coming here, it was a red Soviet city. But, visiting Lviv after 10, 12 years, it's a completely different world. Young people wear jeans, young people sing in the streets. And you can hear music, and it seems more and more resemble a normal city in contemporary Europe. I was told there is something interesting going on in the center of town. There was a group of young men, dressed in German SS uniforms, with dark green painted motorcycles. Exactly as I remember from the time of the war. I don't know what made me do it. I like returned to my childhood, which seems very strange. That I wanted to act as the Germans, as if I'm a German. Because we used to hear from time to time groups of Germans singing, always the same German song. And I do remember that the kids, us, the kids, even inside the ghetto with all the dangers, and knowing that the Germans may kill us, we were playing Jews and Germans. Which of course is completely crazy. But children they were playing the games which happened in reality. As the church and the residents of the late Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky. Sheptytsky was a very unusual personality. He was the leader of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. In Galicia for many many years. And in spite of the circumstances he did speak out about the killing of Jews. Against the use of Ukrainian young people to round up and kill Jews. And he himself with this community of religious people, saved around 150 Jews, among them many young boys and girls. Sister Herezanda, she's one of the oldest still surviving witnesses of how Sheptytsky saved Jews during the Second World War. And it's already many years that I make an effort to have him recognized as a righteous gentile. In the summer of 1945 in the moving population known as we were moved to Poland, and we landed in Lodz. My memories are centered mainly on three locations. My apartment, my school, and my youth movement. Whenever I come to visit Lodz, I'm drawn like by a magnet. It's out of my control almost to these three places, which were the center of my life in those years. And I try to find the oldest person who lives there. Hello. Who perhaps remembers something. Wait a minute, I'm looking only after history, and looking for memories of the past. When I was in it was a very happy place. And now it looks like an old cemetery. Okay. It's the first time that I take a rickshaw in Lodz. From time to time I like to stop people. Even on the street and start a conversation. Are you studying at the university? Yes, law university. Law? Law. And you speak Polish? A little bit. From France. I am very bad in French. I just like French songs. It's a beginning. So tell me what's your impression from this city? For the moment I love it because it's very beautiful. Do you know that decades ago it was not only Poles who lived in this city? I do know there used to be a lot of Jewish people, because there was big cemetery, a Jewish cemetery. Tell me please did you face here any kind of discrimination against you or something? No. Or people are open and nice, what would you say? They might be a little bit shy because especially in Lodz there's not many stranger. That's it. So at first they might be a little bit shy. But as soon as you start to speak Polish. They accept you. They say ooh. It's okay, yeah they accept you. Good, good luck. - Thank you. - And enjoy the city. Thank you very much. Bye bye. Bye. Bye, bye, bye. To me it's not enough at all to check only archival documents and read newspapers. A very important part in research and writing of history is the human touch. In other words meeting with real people who went through these times and these events. A general image of Ukrainians and Polish people in Israel is negative. Public images of Poles and the Ukrainians are as of anti-Semites, anti-Jewish. Not willing to help during the war. Bad neighbors. Parts of all this are of course true historically. But I have one argument which is very difficult to argue against. That if not for a family from Berezhany I wouldn't be sitting here and talking. That I was not delivered by Poles or Ukrainians to the Nazis, but I was saved by them. In early 1950, apparently in January we immigrated to Israel. Our Israeli visas were issued at the Israeli Ligation in Warsaw in December 1949. Karol Codogni and his father Stanislaw, Poland. Kontsevich, Ania. Kontsevich Tatyana.
