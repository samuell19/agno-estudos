Bedelia This was Bedelia,beautiful and charming She radiated a curious innocence immediately fascinated those she attracted like a poisonous flower I first met her in Monte Carlo that's where the strange story of Bedelia begins Monte Carlo in the autumn of 1938 Oh Mr Chaney,Monsieur Martin is in the office Thank you What a lovely little dog,you must have one like that Entre -Monsieur Chaney -Bon giornio Monsieur Martin -How are you -Excellent,thank you Will you not sit down? I see that you have found a friend -What a lovely creature -Yes,isn't she My poor,innocent young friend I fear for you There is not a woman in Monte Carlo, that not will be attracted by that dog Do you think so? You are just in time The lady should be here any moment now Will you introduce me? Yes,of course if she is interested in your offer Even if she is not I still like to meet her Your letter of introduction only says that you are acting for Verrefour Now please,Mon Ami,tell me, is it a pearl you after or the lady? We all have our secrets,Monsieur Martin Of course,of course if you wish but I warn you that if it is a lady than you are wasting your time,there is no chance for you You don't know me,Monsieur Martin No,but I know my customer she is on her honeymoon,and it seems, unhappily for you,to be a very happy one You told me she was married before First honeymoon is one thing, second can be very different Oh Madame Carrington you understand is not a divorcee type Her first husband,who died,was rich,oh very very rich but her new husband she loves Too bad The lady and the pearl are both here She brought me a black pearl one of the most perfect I've ever seen and asked me to design a setting Just one note,I will see what I can do for you Bon jour Madame Are you satisfied? More than satisfied,I'm delighted I have never seen such a beautiful setting Worthy of such a pearl and for the hands that'll wear it -It's lovely -Permetez,un moment,s'il vous plait Oui,Monsieur It is without a flaw -Madame,should you ever wish to sell it? -I shan't ever But if you should,Madame, you will give me a chance? My offer would be generous How much? 100 000 francs 100 000 francs No,Monsieur Martin,sorry, this pearl is not for sale You send my bill to the Imperial Hotel?

I don't like having my photograph taken You don't? Why not? I'm not photogenic Who told you that? Several cameras Not this one,this camera can't lie No,I say Darling,that's absurd Something happens to me when I look into a camera I'd sooner face a dentist than a photographer I haven't got a single picture of you Haven't you something better? You've got me -Let's go out -Can I bring my camera? If you promise confine yourself to picture postcard views Is my bill ready,Madame?

Thanks I risk it alone You mind if I come along to observe your method? If you don't pull it off I'll send you a drink BTW my name is Chaney,Ben Chaney Mine Carrington Haven't I met you somewhere before Madame? Oh,no I don't think so Wasn't it in Paris? Paris?

She has some sort of obsession,thinks she is not photogenic either,it's absurd Betty,what's this? Oh that? I've had it for ages Well,I've never seen it before Oh,it's a cheap little thing I picked up in Paris cost about 40 francs I don't like to see it on you,darling Why not? I don't like artificial jewellery Everybody wears nowadays,very chic I'm sorry I maybe old fashioned I don't like my wife wearing imitations I'm sorry you disapprove of my taste Mrs Carrington is quite right, she is not an easy subject There you see Charlie it's not just an obsession But she is a very interesting one -Am I? -To a painter Your colours,magnificent, your lines tempting I'm speaking as an artist now I'm about to paint you Would you sit for me? Of course she'd be delighted, won't you Biddy? I'm flattered but I shall have to think about it I must go and change,nice meeting you,Mr Chaney Would you dine with me? I'm staying here Oh,good,we will Come up to my room first and have a drink I'd like to show some of my works We have a date for tonight Thanks all the same,some other time Chaney Have you ever seen so blueish eyes? She is plain She doesn't,she's perfect Aren't you beautiful? I wish I could take her back with me You can't,you know,what about the quarantine regulations? Always get round those It isn't as easy as all that besides she doesn't even belong to you Charlie Darling Noted anything? I notice a very lovely hand That silly old ring,I'm never going to wear it again Because I criticized it? Oh,Lord, did that worry you so much,darling? You married a bit of a prig ,you know You were quite right,your taste is much better than mine I see Entrez Ce la Souffage ,Madame Madame est vraiment tres gentile avec Souffage Madame,permettez peu prendre maintennant Dites moi,Ninette,combien demandez vous por sa chat Je regret,Madame,ce pas de vendre -Mais je vous paie bien -Non Madame,vous vraiments,Mon mari.. Don't you argue about it,Biddy, you can't take that cat into England It's easy to hide in my bag and flirt with the custom inspectors No you won't not when you are with me Oh,all women smuggle a bit,didn't you know? -Here you are,Ninette -Merci,Monsieur-Thank you -Bon soir Monsieur,Bon soir madame -Bon soir I shall miss Souffage I think you are horrid Oh Darling,you don't really mean that,do you? Charlie,even when I tease you,I love you You know I do? I'll have a bottle,please -Just to round up the celebration,Biddy -Celebration? -Our second wedding anniversary -Second? Two months today Well,well,still happily married You know,looking at you two,even a hardened bachelor like me has his regrets When I started out on my holiday I didn't think I end up married You'll fall for it too And then you'd found out how much you missed Marriage is like religion,no one is so zealous as the new converts Don't you agree? I'm the only convert,my wife have been married before I am so sorry,Mrs Carrington,I'd no idea Don't worry,Mr Chaney, how would you to know? Anyway I think it a little to be embarrassed about past I couldn't agree with you more Would I make things worse if I said I hoped the past was the happiest presences Most of it was very happy,Charlie is making forget the past that wasn't Her husband was an artist in Paris We had very little money and it made things a bit difficult sometimes I know what that can be like Other way I wonder why I know you first husbands works I doubt it He would have been a great painter had he lived,he was just beginning to sell His name Burgess,Raoul Burgess No,I don't think I ever run across anything of his If you ever do will you get it for me? My wife hasn't one of his paintings Of course I will -For your anniversary -To our guest To Bedelia and her portrait BTW how is it going? Slowly,rather slowly Excuse me will you Mr Chaney I'd rather you didn't go on with my portrait Why not? Don't like the thing it makes me nervous You wouldn't deprive posterity of my masterpiece? Posterity is not worth my getting a headache every day? But your husband is so keen on it You want to please him,don't we? Listen Remember? They were playing this when we first met Shall we dance? Anything wrong? He'll charge you with an enormous fee for painting my portrait What makes you think so? I know artists,they don't stay in hotel like this unless they are looking for a chance to portrait rich men's wives But I am not a rich man He probably think you are this is a very expensive hotel and we are spending as if we had millions Well,you only go on your honey moon once in your life Oh,sorry,darling It's very nice having money to spend but I love you just as much if you hadn't any Darling All the same I shan't let him charge you an outrageous fee All right Raoul Burgess Headache again? Tired Just five minutes more Bedelia No one sitting for a portrait has any right to look as enchanting as you do Why not? For the posterity it is perfect You weren't happily married? I'm saying more than I'm going to Sometimes I paint what I think what it was that I see I find it fascinating to try and catch not just the face and the figure of my subject but to portray the soul of my model To the artist you are a puzzling subject How puzzling? You ought to have red hair Makes your colours next when she was making you up Biddy What's the matter,darling? How soon can you be packed? -What happened? -We are going home Sorry to drag you from all of this but I can't help it out Has the directors accepted your plan? They will.But I must be at the next meeting -It means a lot to you,doesn't it? -I pay more income tax You're not deserting me? What about the portrait? Posterity will have to do without you So unfortunately would I I must trying to get up to Yorkshire sometime and finish it That's a great idea The Dales are the painter's paradise anyway he must come,mustn't he darling? -Yes, you come -Thank you -But it's not possible -Why not,we've plenty of rooms Have you ever had an artist staying with you?Not like having the vicar to tea He's quite right,darling,artists want lot of space to mess about him Take that up to my room,will you? Very nice of you but it wouldn't work I'm afraid I should need a studio We could find you a place in no time,my partner knows every house in the district Monsieur Dabergin,je ne veux par po Monsieur, Madame Du Lac,ma chere Madame Du Lac I'm afraid you've made a mistake Madame,por l'amour de ciel Pardon,are you not Madame Turdeau Du Lac de Bordeaux? No,no this is my wife Pardon,I'm sorry -But see you before we go -Sure Oh,Salaud Cette inexcusable I was certain she was Madame Du Lac de Bordeaux Don't worry we all make these mistakes I know,I know but I worry very much,Monsieur Me,never forget a face Make such a blunder You seem disappointed did you know Madame Du Lac well? Oh,early husband was my very good friend He left for paradise,his widow left no address You mean she disappeared? Completely Seems to have upset you? Was it very important? In itself no but in my business we like to be correct and exact Forgive me,Monsieur,what is your business? Assurances sur la vie, pardon,life insurances Vous allez entendre maintenant Nocturno lui par le Monsieur Louis Stevens de la BBC Londres Ben Hello,I thought you were packing -When are you off? -First thing in the morning I came down to talk to you I'm honoured,have a drink? No thank you Shall we go out on the terrace? Well? Did you mean what you said about coming to Yorkshire? Yes I did I wish you wouldn't That's why came down, what about the portrait? Portraits are only an excuse Excuse for what? I want you to stay away from me altogether Do you? Why? I'm happily married,I intend to remain so But your husband wants your portrait That's not what you want What do you think I want? Charlie likes you,he thinks you are his friend I am glad to know that He is not like my friends When you are sincere as he is it doesn't ever occur to you anybody else can be deceitful But you never deceived your husband,Bedelia?

No,no I'm all right But you are white as a sheet It's nothing Something I've eaten probably You'd better go straight to bed I'll bring you a powder This awful bubbly thing of yours? -They helped you before,didn't they? -Yes Come along I'll just cease the fire -You're sure you'll be all right? -Yes,yes I'm sure Charlie Charlie Mr Chaney you haven't eaten your porridge That comes from all the smoked salmon you had at the party last night I liked smoked salmon,Hannah, I don't like porridge When you've been here a bit you'll eat your porridge in the morning like we all do Hello,hello who is it? It's you Mary? See? Mr Carrington? That's bad Food poisoning? Well is there anything we can do? Would you like me to come over and help you? Mary? Hello He must have,she know that everything is happening to Mr Carr.. -Oh,Mr Chaney -Good Morning,Mary Hannah gave me the news How's Mr Carrington? Oh,Mr Chaney,he's poor all night Did you get the doctor? He couldn't come he was at Mation's Bed,he is here now What does he say? Oh,all them fancy foods last night that's what I say Mrs Carrington must have been worried How has she'd take it? I wish you'd seen her,Sir,if he hadn't been for her he would be laid out by now What exactly did she do for him? Whatever she did was right I'm sure of that wouldn't you like to wait in the room, Mrs Carrington will be down in a minute Thank you,Mary Good Bye,Charlie we'll have you up and about in no time Tell me,Dr McAfee,please How bad is he? I'll be honest,I don't know yet But it's no use,you worrying until I do know Is it something you're afraid to tell me? When he feels better I'll give him a thorough overhaul You could have seen him last night It was probably something he eat Good Morning Bedelia,I'm sorry to hear about Charlie,anything I can do? No thank you You must have had a bad night -May I? -Thanks How's the patient doctor? Getting along pretty well,thanks to this little lady's good sense You must try to get some rest my dear Aren't you having a nurse? I don't need one Don't you think it would be a good idea,doctor? There is not much to do,Bedelia has proved she is very capable But she looks worn out I prefer to look after my husband myself Then you shall,my dear -Good Bye -Good Bye -And thank you for everything -Take care of yourself I look in again tonight Good Bye Mr Chaney Doctor,may I have a word with you? I've a fairly busy morning You're driving into town can I come along? All right Bye Bedelia But I fail to understand your interest in this case,Mr Chaney Charlie is friend of mine,doctor,and I think.. That's no reason why you should tell me how to diagnose a case Don't misunderstand me doctor,I am not criticizing It's just that there is something I think you want to know There is nothing about Charlie Carrington that I don't know I pulled that boy through diphtheria and measles the day he was born I held him by he heels and I slapped the breath into him What are you trying to tell me,Mr Chaney? What's this? Investigator,detective? Look here,what is all this about? I made this for you darling Please try and drink it I can't understand why Ellen hasn't phoned You are not to worry about the office Darling,this is serious,a load of timber from Scotland There it is again But it means a lot of money and why hasn't she phoned Because I told her you're not to be disturbed Now drink your barley water it'll do you good I am not as ill as all that You were last night,you frightened me Charlie All right,Bedelia,I'll drink your barley water If that's Ellen I'll not let her worry you Don't be so jumpy,darling, you need rest more than I do Come in -Dr McAfee to see you,Madam -What does he want? He didn't say nothing Hello,I had a call up the road and I thought I pop in and see how you are getting along You said you weren't coming back till this evening I changed my mind about the treatment, in fact I engaged a nurse she is on her way Don't you think I'm the best nurse for my husband you said before Take it easy,darling Sit down What's the idea am I ill as all that? Better safe than sorry The after effect of food poisoning sometimes need watching more carefully than one expect And it's for Bedilia's sake too,Charlie,she needs rest That's what I said How long have you been having these troubles before? A few weeks,months perhaps, didn't bother me very much, Bedilia's giving me something for it What does she give you? It's just a sedative I take it myself It works,very good stuff Made up in Paris? It's a prescription my doctor gave me May I? I like to find out about one of this miracles of yours Try and get to sleep, Charlie,you too,Bedilia The nurse shall be here at six and she will be in complete charge,you understand? -Good Evening -Good Evening I'm Miss Walker of Carrington's Company I telephoned you several times today Yes,Miss Have you any news about that load of timber from Inverness? I've got the dispatch note here -I talked to the station master,Miss -Yes He'd like to see the dispatch note -And this is nurse Harris -How do you do? How do you do Mrs Carrington quite understand now that you are in complete charge of the patient Mary what are you doing? Making the bed of the new ,Mum But the nurse is to sleep in there? She told me make the guest room up for you For me? Doctor's order,Mrs Carrington The Chemist's boy just brought this,Madam Anything on account of Mr Carrington,Mary, should be given to me Excuse me,is that for Mr Carrington? Yes,I thought he might like some gruel today The doctor told me exactly what to give him,Mrs Carrington Steady,darling I'm going to get your milk,Mr Carrington How long is this going on? I don't know,darling,why don't you get rid of her,you are so much better Yes,I'll have a talk to Dr McAfee Here it is Will you drink it now please it's your bedtime Yes I suppose so -Good Night -Good Night,darling Sleep well -Good Night,nurse -Good Night Then what do you think I discovered they made a mistake and sent the stuff to Leeds Are we going to get it,every minute means money down the drain We've got a claim against them for what is worth but I suppose as usual the railway will be right I'm afraid so Come in -Mr Chaney,Madam -Ask him to come up That's not necessary,may I join the party? Of course Ben -Hello Bedilia -Hi Ben -Hello,Charlie,how are you? -I am fine,won't you sit down Thanks You certainly look better than I expected So I ought to,three devoted women looking after me night and day I was so worried when I heard you engaged the nurse -I thought you m.. -At death's door,eh Otherwise a Yorkshireman wouldn't coddle himself Of course I wouldn't agree if my wife hadn't forced Oh now darling -BTW how is the portrait coming along? -It isn't My model has been on holiday,when are you going to sit again,Bedelia? How about tomorrow? It'll be a change for you,darling This our nurse Nurse Harris,Miss Walker How do you do? How do you do And Mr Chaney -How do you do -How do you do Time for your medicine,Mr Carrington Nurse Harris look very efficient,Bedelia Where did you find her? If I am ever ill I must ask you to get someone like that for me Dr McAfee recommended her -Good Afternoon,Miss -Hello,Hannah -Is Mr Chaney in there now? -Would you like to go in? Thank you -Hello,Ellen -I hope I'm not disturbing you No,not at all Glad of the excuse the lights gone anyway -Let me take your coat -No thank you Won't you sit down? Ben,I've come to ask you something, it's rather important Wouldn't it be easier sitting down? Have a cigarette? This is rather difficult for me I don't like interfering in other people's affairs but this time one of my best friend is involved Involved in what? I don't know,that's why I've come to see you There is something odd going on -In Leeds? Never -Please don't be flippant You know perfectly well what I mean There is some sort of an intrigue and that woman is in it What woman? The nurse Intrigue with nurse Harris? Why should you think that? Because at the station you obviously knew her well But at Charlie's house you pretended you never even met her before Dr McAfee engaged Nurse Harris Aren't you letting your imaginations run away with you? You can't put me off like that, why did you try to deceive Charlie? Bedilia was there too,wasn't she? What do you want to do? Warn Charlie? Yes You'd better be careful You can't do that without bringing Bedilia into it -I know what I am doing -Do you? Could look like jealousy,couldn't it? I shall risk that All right,you are going over to tell him right away? Yes I'll come with you Should be an interesting party Everything looks so lovely covered with snow I was brought up in Cornwall, we don't see much of it down there Do you think we are in for a blizzard,Charlie? -Looks very much like it -How long would it last? Two days maybe three Do the roads get blocked? If it is a bad one Let's have a look at the forecast I hope the train doesn't get held up I've got a friend coming down from Edinburgh More tea,Ellen? Yes,please,just half Heavy snow,I doubt your friend will make it I expected him just after Christmas but he got held up by storms at sea He's a ship's captain,interesting chap, I'd like you to meet him By all means bring him on sometimes I'd think you would find him amusing His name is Cpt McKelvey Mrs Carrington the tea How silly of me I must be getting along,thank you for your tea,Bedilia,Good Bye Good Bye Why don't you slip in to do the portrait again? I hate leaving things unfinished I'll let you know Ben are you going into town? Sorry,I'm afraid not,Ellen, I'm going straight home I got to get through a call to Edinburgh We'll come and dig you out in the morning -Right.Good Bye Charlie -Good Bye Will you excuse me Are you all right,darling? I've a slight headache, it's nothing I lie down for a while Good Bye,Ellen,come again soon Good Bye You mind switching on the lights,nurse Don't go,it's early yet -Charlie -What is it? Something wrong? No it's nothing I must go it's getting dark Ellen Have you noticed anything peculiar about Bedelia lately? Peculiar? She is so nervous not like herself at all I thought it was the shock of my illness but she seems to getting worse instead of better I wonder if you could talk to her Me? You women talk more easily about these things try to district her,get her out of the house perhaps she was to start sitting for Ben again You will have a word with her,won't you? Yes,of course I will if you want me to I knew you would help me You are coming to the office tomorrow? No,the doctor said I would take it easy for a bit you come here,please do Charlie,whenever you need me I'll be there Never heard you talk like that before Good Night Charles What time does the train leave for London? Tonight 8 45 and 1130 Thank you Yes You rang Madam? Oh yes,Mary,could we have early dinner and then you could wash up before you go into town -But it isn't my evening off,Madam -Isn't it? Oh,take it anyway didn't you say once you wanted to see your cousins Oh Yes Madam You haven't had an evening off sine Mr Carrington been ill It's very kind of you,Madam, but really I think.. What's for dinner,Mary? Well,you ordered beef for us I don't know what she is planning for Mr Carrington Mr Carrington will have beef as well But what would she say with the duties,responsibilities and doctor's order We thought we would have early dinner,Mary Forty year I've lived in this house the only person I took orders from was the Mistress And I gave you my order -What's that? -An omelette for Mr Carrington But that's absurd Mr Carrington isn't ill any longer Fish out the beef,Mary I will that I'm sorry,Mrs Carrington,as long as I am on this case I'm responsible You are not responsible for running this house,nurse I'm getting tired of your interference and I'm not going to stand it any longer I'm not trying to run this house and I'm not interfering What's all the fuss about I'm sorry darling I lost my temper but this can't go on Mr Carrington,it is my duty Please Mr Carrington it is clear Charlie -Send her away -We can't do anything tonight Yes,you can,there is a train at 845 Mary,ring for a taxi Nurse Harris she can just catch the 8 45 Am I being dismissed? Mrs Carrington and I are very grateful for all you've done but we shan't require your services any longer -I'm responsible only to Dr McAfee -I'll settle with the doctor Now will you please go and pack Mr Carrington -More coffee? -No thank you darling You can take it away now Where are you going,Mary? Mrs Carrington said I should go and see my cousins There is a taxi there and I will go with that nurse The weather? She could spend a night with her cousins and come back in the morning Very well Look her Biddy every time I hear this tune I think of the first time I ever saw you Remember? And that enormous black hat you had on You did look sweet you know Charlie let's go away Go away? Please take me away tonight You can't be serious? Charlie,please take me away Biddy what come over you? I don't like it here But this afternoon you were in love with the place? You are not afraid of the storm are you? Don't you love me any more? Of course I love you but what's that got to do with it? We could go to the Continent, France,Charlie,the South of France Darling I am not made of money Or America,The Queen Mary sails on Monday we could stay in London until then couldn't we? You've gone quite mad You don't love me anymore This is utterly absurd I've never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life Biddy,darling,if you tell me what's the matter I'll help you as I can ,I can't go away for holiday this time of the year I've got work to do Charlie,Charlie don't ever believe in anything Ben tells you Ben? What's he got to do with it? He wants to hurt me,he worm our lives Can you please explain all this without becoming so hysterical please try and be reasonable I don't want to stay here any longer we could so easily go tonight Biddy I will not talk to you anymore until you come to your senses This is the national program here is the weather forecast for tonight and tomorrow a deep depression over Iceland is heading fast east and towards the British Isles Winds North North West reaching gale forces You here? What's wrong? I got the sack I thought it safer to come rather than phone With a small town like this you never know whose is whose cousins Mrs Carrington has had that on the 8 45 On my way out here I stopped to report to Dr McAfee Why? My duty as a nurse,the analyst's report has come -Well? -Negative You heard what he said about you,Mr Chaney Flattering? He thinks you imagined the whole thing and he is sorry he ever listened to you I didn't imagine Charlie's illness what is his final verdict on that? Stomach ache and in case you ever get it he sent you this Biddy Bedelia There are still a couple of details I would like to get straight -Which one fired you? -He did Put she put him up to it But it was her idea to get rid of Mary too Get rid of Mary? Where is she? Staying the night with the cousins, Mrs Carrington arranged that Why didn't you tell me that at once? -Well -I'm so sleepy Is that all you have to say? I was naughty wasn't I? -Are you angry with me? -No I'm not angry I would like some sort of explanation Why did you do it? You were unkind,Charlie,you shouted at me Biddy,look at me I don't understand You can't go rushing off into a blizzard just because I refused to listen to some crazy idea about a holiday Charlie I love you so terribly I'm so afraid I am not good enough for you Please be sensible I am not intelligent like you are I can't talk about the things that interest you whenever I see you with Ellen I realize what you must miss in me Biddy,Biddy tell me honestly why did you run off? Well Before I married you,please don't be angry with me for saying this I was poor and lonely you were attractive I liked you but I didn't love you I can tell you this because now I do,desperately And? And when I found that I loved you like that I was frightened and I promised myself whatever you got tired of me or was sorry you married me I'd run away,it's all But Bedelia you wanted me to go with you? And you wouldn't All right Try and get some sleep now What are you doing here? Are you all right,Charlie? I said what are you doing here? I was passing and saw your car, I just wondered if you were all right What happens? Why are you so interested? Now I know you are all right I'll be getting along No,stay where you are I want to talk to you,now -Well -What have you done to my wife? What do you mean? Why is she afraid of you? Afraid of me? Tell me,Charlie, what has happened? She tried to run away Blame me for it? What has she told you? Don't hedge,you've done or said something that terrified her and damned you going to tell me what it is All right,Charlie,I'll tell you But believe I didn't want to You remember at tea time I mentioned the name James McKelvey? Yes You remember I told you he was a sea captain?-Yes His family were chemists in Edinburgh James McKelvey run away to sea, but Hugh the brother stayed on under his management the firm grew more and more prosperous He was a bachelor until he was 48,he disliked women That's why it was such shock when he got married And the greatest shock when we saw the bride So much younger than he was,and a red head We all wondered why she married him You don't mind me saying so,Cpt? The brother was hit in his ways He was devoted to his work Often he worked here all through the night And he keeps his work sitting there, the very spot where you are now This were her room It's just as it was,nothing been touched I want it to be kept like that How she loved her pretty things It didn't seem wrong she was such a pretty creature herself Didn't you think so,Cpt? How old was she? I couldn't say somewhere in her twenties The only thing didn't understand was that red hair,do you think it was natural? I'd admired Maureen's hair,you see I always had a weakness for red haired women A photograph of Mrs McKelvey? I've never seen one She wasn't photo,what was the word she always said? -Photogenic? -Yes,that was it Some people,you know,even if they are handsome,don't take a good picture I'd sooner face a dentist than a photographer she said Did she? A terrible shock for her when her husband was taken so sudden A shock for me too He's never been ill in his life I was away in the Caribbean when I got news of my brother's death It was food poisoning It was lucky for Mrs McKelvey that fish didn't agree with her I made a chop for her that night I remember it as it was yesterday -Maybe she return some day -She won't I feel it here The shock of her husband's death was too much for her No.It wasn't that McKelvey was highly insured,you see, He increased his policy after he married Maureen There was another case You remember the Frenchman we met in a hotel at Monte Carlo? One who thought he recognized Madame DuLac of Bordeaux? Why are you telling me these stories? Because they are facts After you left I went over to Bordeaux, the case was almost identical Madame DuLac husband died suddenly on Sunday evening DuLac née en Bordeaux, marié,voila Monsieur? In correct it's simply my routine Rien de extraordinaire,apoplexie apres une attaque indigestion acute Immediately after the inquest the company is always prompt about such things you know we send the wife a cheque for the sum Monsieur DuLac had assigned to her but he had another policy a small one which he had neglected to assign part of which should have gone to the widow we needed a signature,but she'd gone away -She left no address? -No Her lawyer couldn't trace her? No relations or friends except some people her husband had introduced her to I often,Maxime why did she marry him? After his death we could not console her One could understand her wish to go from home so quickly but we have heard that she did not once write us a little letter I often think of her poor woman They needn't voice that sympathy, her husband was insured for 15000 £ The most recent case,the one that led to this investigation concern Arthur Jacobs,a Manchester man, died in January almost a year ago Also heavily insured How do you know all this? Similarity with them Jacobs case and the others Especially McKelvey so striking that I was instructed to conduct a complete investigation I see,so you've been lying to me since the day I met you Ben Chaney the charming artist Coming up here as my friend, get out Arthur Jacob's was a jeweller And he died in January That's interesting,very interesting Last January a man called Raoul Burgess and his wife were living in Paris There never was a Raoul Burgess Our agent combed every studio in Paris No one had ever herd of him, I painted that picture And I faked the signature I don't believe you Mrs Jacobs like all the other wives had left all her possessions behind except for one thing That was to valuable to leave, Arthur Jacobs gave her a black pearl Ring was worthless,she gave it away Who to? We traced that pearl to Monte Carlo You are wrong you know, you've no proof of anything We've no proof of crime yet but if James McKelvey shall identify her brother's widow criminal proceedings would follow I had enough,get out I found that bag by the car I think you'd better look inside Charlie Charlie Have you been down here all night? You poor darling you must have fallen asleep in the chair Aren't you're going to say Good Morning? You feel better when you have your coffee I'll go and put it on Mary didn't get back Isn't it quiet after that dreadful storm? I was so frightened The road has vanished there is not a trace of it We must be snowed out We are cut off and alone Now you look much better,nice and smooth It'll do your good I know what's upset you It's that silly old ring,isn't it? That's why you are angry with me I was naughty,darling,I did mean to give it away but I do love pretty things I know how you hate a lie that's one of the things I admire so much about you,your honesty But I didn't want Sylvia to have my ring You do understand don't you? I wonder how would you look with red hair? Would you like me to dye it? McKelvey's wife had red hair Sit down Bedilia Why were you so upset yesterday when Ben mentioned Cpt McKelvey? Why do say I was upset? I'd never heard of Cpt whatever his name is Mckelvey's brother was your husband wasn't he? What a silly question? You know Raoul Burgess was my only husband besides you dear Listen Bedelia,we got to talk this out I hate that wretched ring I wish I had given it to Sylvia It has never brought me anything than bad luck Arthur Jacobs gave it to you,didn't he? It's worthless you couldn't get five pounds for it in London So he did give it to you? You got to stop lying to me Ben Chaney is a liar I warned you about him he's been against me from the beginning What about Jacobs why didn't you tell me that you were married to him? It was so awful Charlie, he was mean and cruel I had to forget That seems hard to believe You married me under a false name Burgess was my maiden name Perhaps not even legally married at all I don't want any marriage but to you,Charlie What about the others? They were no others only Arthur Jacobs and you I've got such a headache What about McKelvey,what about DuLac were they so mean and cruel that you don't want to remember them either? -I'm innocent -Innocent of what? I hate men There wasn't peace so I wish all the men were dead Yes,you had a hard time hadn't you? I didn't chose them They came along they wanted me The real story of your life must be very different from the one you told me If I had ever the thoughts she had I would be good enough for you -She? -Ellen You don't know,you,your world, it's all so sweet and lovely isn't it? Your world is so nice,jam and sweets everyday tables for Christmas My grandfather brought me the over mantle from Italy The gardens divine when the roses are in bloom -Divine,divine -Stop it Quiet Quiet Darling Say it Charlie Say quiet Charlie Quiet,darling Oh Charlie you are so good to me I never knew a man could be like you Why didn't I meet you before Don't leave me You needn't be afraid I'd never hurt you Don't ever stop loving me Good Morning Mr Charles wasn't it a terrible storm,the buses couldn't get through the snow Thank Mr Jones,you are welcome Good Morning,Madam I'm sorry I was so late,but that was providence Grocers couldn't deliver today What have you brought Mary? It isn't all ours,I phoned Hannah I brought it back to see if they were wanting anything,it's lucky I did, because Mr Chaney has a gentleman for lunch,it's that friend of his the Cpt he's been excepting all the week, he came last night by the 11 o'clock train but they had to stop at the hotel because the roads were blocked I got them some of that smoked salmon Mary,let me Hannah is sending a boy for Mr Chaney's basket, will you put it on the table Mr Charles Mrs Carrington looks poorly this morning Yes,she's got a rather bad headache,Mary Good Morning,could we give any help? No thanks I've got somebody coming along Can you please direct us to Brecknall house? Yes,about half a mile up the road on the left Many thanks -Lovely morning isn't it? -Yes it is Mary have you seen Mr Carrington? Yes,Madam,he's gone out to the car Thank you Would you go up and do my room? Yes Madam,should I finish the washing up,it'll only take two minutes? -No,leave it go to my room at once -Yes,Madam Only there'll be a boy calling to pick up this stuff,it's for Mr Chaney Don't worry I'll give it to him What are you doing? I came down to feed Topas We'd forgotten about her Why didn't you call Mary? Mary is busy we are very late this morning I mustn't keep Topas waiting I'll get some sardines She seems to doing pretty well for herself Charlie stop her You had it,Ben can't eat it now -Don't let her have it -Why? -Please stop her -Why? I think you better start packing Darling are we going away? Bit of a hurry,there won't be much time I knew it,I knew you'd change your mind I shan't be going with you I die without you You wouldn't let me go alone? You won't be going alone You turned against me too But you made a mistake You are wrong what happened downstairs,you don't understand I'm afraid I do The poison was meant for Ben Charlie I'd made a decision I'm going to give you my money Every shilling of it,it's all yours -That money -45000£ 45000 £ you are mad,absolutely mad You'd never stop loving me Charlie I loved the woman that doesn't exist Yes,hello Ben Yes I know it's here Any time you like,come now You're not give me.. I couldn't stand it Ben hurts me I'm not strong -I know -Yes I know I never told you I kept it from you so you should not worry -But it freezes,I'm -Incurable I'm sorry to disturb you Madam,you forgot me to tell me about lunch Lunch? Yes First course soup Mushroom omelette Old Mr Charles always liked that,Madam -And cheese and biscuits -Yes,Madam Anything else? Yes,Mary,there is something else Will you make a phone call for me? Of course I will,Madam Mr Carrington doesn't like eating alone would you ring the office and ask Miss Ellen to come? Miss Ellen? Won't you be here,Madam? No,Mary,you'll look after them There were no mystery about her motives,she killed for money But there were still an enigma,the enigma of a soul of a human being to commit murder Bedilia could caress and with the same soft hands poisoning in cold blood In that delicate balance of good and evil Life the deepest of human mysteries The problem that no detective,physician or psychologist has ever solved Subtitles by Seglora
