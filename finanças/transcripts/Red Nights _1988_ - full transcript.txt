We are on location in Hollywood, early at the scene of an intense shootout which has already left two victims dead in its wake. The shooting began in the apartment building just behind me where the alleged gunman is still at large. Police are on the scene, urging him to surrender. -Randy! Randy, it's Phillip! You don't want to die, do you, boy? Look, I'm sure when the police find out the truth, they're going to be lenient. Randy. You're a good boy. I know you're not a murderer.

David has been showing me the sights, and they're just fantastic. I found a great apartment, and I've started looking for acting jobs. Don't worry, because I'm going to get in my career soon. Everything's fine. I'll see you real soon. Love, Randy. What's your name? -Randy Douglas. -The ones I've marked are the best. Now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by this sun of York. Why... Why... Why am I so unhappy? -What makes you think you're such a great actor? -If Tom Sully can make it, I can too. -Right. Well, I wish you good luck. Who's next? Randy, how about you? Get up there. What was your first experience with acting? -I was a kid, about 12. And they were making a TV movie, Conquer New Hampshire. That's where I'm from. And they were looking for kids to ride horses, and I was the best horseback rider in my whole age group. So I ended up on TV. Nationwide. -Did you have any lines? -One I remember is the guywho's playing the leading actor, he rides up to meand he says... "Hey kid. What time is Linda coming?" And I looked up at himand I said... "At the ratethat you chain smoke, she'll be hereby your tenth pack." -That's a nice, tacky line. Yeah, Betty, I thought maybe we could get together. I don't know, wherever you'd like. Okay, that sounds good. Yeah, I'll be there. Okay, okay. All right. Okay. I'll talk to you real soon, Betty. Bye bye. Hey, where are we going? I want to show you where I was working last week. Oh, I met this big producer, Ross Burton. He's so nice! He really liked my work. -What is it exactlythat you do do? -Little bit of this, little bit of that. Busy, busy, busy. I'll introduce you to him, I'm sure he'll like you. See? This is Paramount. It's really difficult to get in. Yeah. Really looks that way. Where is it? Come on! Where is it, where is it, where is it? -Cut! -Really let him have it, huh? -Ron! -Bye darling, you were great! -Thank you, I'll see you tomorrow! -Man, I envy the factthat you're a working actress. -Oh, don't worry, you'll get a part. It's not talent that counts, it's persistence. -Oh, so maybe,if I'm persistent with you, you'll pay up, huh? -Who knows? -Hey, did you like the lunch? -It was great, thanks. -You know, I never hadthat sushi stuff before. -No?-And I'm not gonna tell anybodythat I ate raw fish and drank hot wine. -No, you don't think... Oh, watch out! -Hey! -Well, have you tried skating yet? -I tried it last weekin Venice. -Well, how'd you do? -Pretty good. But I knocked overa bunch of people, but...

You're still going to be chasing the casting news. -Hi guys. -Hi, babe. -Look at this! God damn. This is where they're casting the cop show, right? Yeah, it's two parts. They're looking for two guys, tall, skinny blonde guys. Cops. Well how come there's all these other types here then? Where are you from, man? They don't know what they're looking for. You know, I was once at this audition where they were looking for a truck driver. They end up casting this chick with big tits. They don't know shit. Here, let me see your resume. Oh, Jesus, this is pathetic. You've got to beef it up a little bit. Take a look at mine. You see, I got Cassavetes, I got Scorsese, I got Bertolucci. You think I ever met those guys? -Excuse me everyone, may I have your attention please? The producers wish to inform you the parts have been cast. Thank you all for coming. -I'm working on a new...

And he cleans his teeth, like, I couldn't believe it. So we're talking,and I say, "so what do you do?" He says, "I was in the border guard." I say, "you're not that old,tell me about the border guard." And he says, "what's there to tell you?" -Want a ride home? -Nah, it's okay. -You sure?It's no problem. -No, I like riding the bus. -Okay, whatever. See you later. Say hi to Phillip. -Okay, take it easy. -Who's that? -He's an interesting guy.

This has got to dowith your friend David. He disappeared three days ago. With, uh... a whole pound of my coke. And that son of a bitch is trying to outrun me. -You still think he's in town? -I know he is. See, now what I'm wondering is if you might know where he is. -You don't? You don't, do you? -How do you know I don't? -Because you're really not that good of an actor, Jimmy. See, listen. When I told you that he disappeared, you looked surprised. Well, one way or the other, I'm going to get him. -Then what are you going to do? -I don't know. I really don't know, exactly. I mean... Maybe we'll break his legs. What do you think, Jeff? What do you think we should do? You think we should crush his fucking kneecaps? You think we should put a fucking bullet in his ear or what? -We should finish the business. And get out of here. -Tell him that he's notgoing to stay alive much longer unless he returns my property. -I thought you guys were friends. -Friends? I don't think so. Does a friend steal your property? Now listen, listen to me. If you talk to him,for his sake, and for yours... Will you let me knowabout that? Okay, that's it. That's it. Jesus, sorry,what is wrong with me? I almost forgot, God,come here for a second, please, come on,come on over here. Come on, come on, come on. Come here. Come on. You rememberthat little joke of yours, in Phillip's store? Come on, you know the one,with the coke, and the fan. Do you remember that? Huh? I think you can... -Hi, Peter. Hey, it's Randy. Fine, yeah, how are you doing? Yeah? Listen. I keep trying to call David, and his phone's always disconnected. If you talk to him, just tell him I've been trying to get a hold of him, okay? All right, yeah. Comedy, huh? You finally made it, huh? Okay. I look forward to seeing you. Okay, all right, bye. Actors, schmactor. My nephew's an actor. I call him on the phone, I say, "so how's it going?" He says, "I got sinus trouble." I say, "what's the matter, nobody will sign you?" -Well, I'd liketo introduce you now to a fabulous blonde,the wonderful Gloria Di Simone! Gloria! -Thank you, Jules. You know, when I was a kid, I wanted to be a nurse. But my mother took one look at me, and she said... Be a comedian. -Well, did you love it? -Yeah, yeah, you're very funny. -Very funny, I heard youlaughing out there. -I did give my best shot. -Thanks a lot. You got all dressed up too,I see. -Hey, look. I know you know where he is, so why don't you just break down and tell me? -How should I knowwhere he is? I'm a comedian,not a psychic. Why are you looking for him? -Because I feel the guy's in a lot of trouble. Think he needs help. -You're not his mother. And he shouldn't havegotten himself mixed up with Brucein the first place. I know Bruce,Bruce is the kind of guy who would pushhis own grandmother down the stairs if she wasn'tmoving fast enough. Listen, we're going outfor some sandwiches, you wanna go? -No, uh... I gotta go. -And my grandmother said to me one day, "Gloria, please don't go to Hollywood! You'll seduce the producers! They'll put you on the casting sofa! All they want is your body!" I took the next bus out. -David? Yeah, I'm all alone. Yeah, I know, Bruce paid me a visit. So where you at, man? I've been looking all over for you. Yeah, it's on the brave. Okay, no one's going to follow me. Yeah, don't worry. Okay. -Oh man, what a rock! -I think you should give it back. -Let me tell you something. Tomorrow night, I'm going to be 10 000 miles away from here. 10 000 miles, eh? -I think you should give it back, because that's the better thing to do. -Hey, another drink, boys? -Yeah, I'll take another shot. -You know, sometimes... I feel like everything is really strange. And it's not real. It's like a dream. I know this sounds stupid, but when I came out here, to this town, I wanted to be somebody. I know that sounds stupid, but that's what I wanted. I wanted to be in the movies. Ride on horses and shoot bad guys, and... Be in westerns. Damn, they don't even make westerns anymore. -Well, I am out of here, man. Want to come with me? I've got money for tickets and everything. -Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we've gotta thank our lovely Miss Chanel! Let's give her a big hand! Here she comes! -Check this out. All right, take it off! -Do that again! The last piece! She took the last piece off... -There's no pieces left. -What happened? -I think we're in a lotof trouble. -What do you mean? -I don't know.
