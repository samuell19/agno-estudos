At last. Where have you been? Shopping. Police raid! Oh shit, the cops! This is the police speaking. This is an illegal gathering. Stay calm, and follow our instructions. ...so you must lie on it... . - In every beginning lives a magic that protects us and helps us to live. The poet Hermann Hesse said in his famous poem "Steps." Today is also a beginning for many of you. The beginning of your service in our city's police force. I would like to ask the members of this year's graduating class to stand. Raise your right hand and repeat after me: I swear I will perform my duties according to the statutes... I swear I will perform my duties according to the statutes... ...and the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany... ...and the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany... ...in agreement with the laws for the public's well-being... in agreement with the laws and the public's well-being... ...and fulfill my responsibilities conscientiously. So help me God. ...and fulfill my responsibilities conscientiously. So help me God. 120 applications for two openings in the homicide squad. As long as I'm not pushing night duty. What about you? Picture processing. - EDP. Internet. A paperpusher. What're you doing there? As little as possible. Don't break a fingernail typing. Schrader? A Chief Inspector Minks wants to talk to you. Who? Don't know him. Tell him you couldn't find me. He knows where you are. Don't make trouble again, okay? This isn't the vice or the narcotics squad. It's homicide. I got a tip. - Listen, we both know why you're wallowing around in the city's pig troughs. Everybody has problems, but your private crusade has gone too far. One more unauthorized operation, one more raid, one more solo run... and you can forget your pension! Do you get the picture? Do you? It's hard not to. You're screaming. Schrader! I don't have the whole damn night! KKZA Schrader, I should... - Sit down. We confiscated your jacket and your police I D. That's it, isn't it? Your jacket? Yeah, it was stolen a few days ago. Parents died young. Raised by your older brother. I bet he was really glad today. He's been in prison for 6 years on a robbery charge. But you already know that, don't you? I read your file if that's what you mean. What I don't get is, what made you join the police? If you don't mind, I'd like to get back to the party. Ex plain it to me. You moved here. Left everything behind. Then these grades. You barely got by. Just did what was necessary, Schrader? What do you want anyway? That's what I'm asking you. I don't have to justify myself to you. This isn't a very good beginning for a fruitful partnership. I want you to work in my department. What? But I... I applied for another department last year and was accepted. This here? What gives you the right... From your jacket. - They're not mine. Then there won't be any problems with the hair test. Your party days are over. You know how it goes. Suspension, disciplinary proceedings. A trial. Or you join my department. Female, about 20, identity unknown. Wanted to cross an intersection at 2:30 a.m... Naked. Why call homicide? She was being chased. - Witnesses? We have a fingerprint from the guy who was after her. After the fire? How did you get a print? From the finger. I found it in her stomach. While being strangled, she bit off the guy's finger, swallowed it and some how got away. Her state of confusion was drug induced. Nipolept, if you really care to know. A nasty finger. Saved us a lot of work. Oh yeah, look at this. My God, what kind of bastard would do a thing like that? It was voluntary. - Voluntary? Who would voluntarily have their tongue split? Body modification. Body what? - Body modification. The latest rage. Should be possible to identify her from the tongue, shouldn't it? What tribe does "Speaks with forked tongue?" belong to? What? - We should want to know who she is. Where should we start looking? What am I doing here? Let somebody else take over this flat foot business. You can always leave, if you like. This must be it! I got it. Top floor. Figures... I was looking for Lynn Wilson. She lives here, doesn't she? Yeah, come on in. Chief Inspector Minks. My colleague Schrader. You're friends? We studied together. In New York. You see each other frequently? No, never. We came back together. That is, at the same time. We lost sight of each other quickly. When did you talk to her last? Before your last phone call? That must have been 3 years ago. Perhaps you could tell me what's going on here. Lynn Wilson is dead. What? - A traffic accident. We don't know anything more specific at the moment. You don't seem to be very sad about your girlfriend's death. We knew each other so long ago. It seems like another lifetime. Anyway, I'm not surprised. Oh yeah? Why? A person's home is supposedly the mirror of their soul. We will probably have to question you in the next few days. Where can we reach you? I'll give you the number of my gallery. That should be enough. Do you have a pen? Don't worry. Somebody will pay for this. Somebody always does. Is that something like a commandment? Experience. Come back home alive. What? - That was a commandment. The only one. Terrific. You know the "in" places, don't you? Ever run into her before? No, never seen her. - Her name's Marie. Last sign of life was a card to her parents. Postmarked "Berlin-Mitte." Quite a while ago. 2 years. - 2 years? Her father's a friend. See if you can find her. A waste of time. If I want your opinion I'll ask you. See if you can find her. What the fuck!? Let go! Fuck off, asshole! You asshole! Get lost, you jack-off! What the hell's going on? I wanna see Marc. You're Minks, aren't you? In the other room. But ring the bell next time. I did. But nobody answered. Right. Oh shit. What day is it? Sunday. Don't you ever go home? What a mess! Is it really that difficult to say something nice? We identified the finger. It belongs to Norbert Gunzel. Previously charged with bodily injury and rape. Distinguishing mark: A heart-shaped tattoo on his right upper arm. Mommy tried. Schrader? Minks? Nobody leaves before we're finished here. Why would anybody do that? Does it matter? Who would've thought the two of us would make homicide. Poscher got stuck with night duty. And you? A week on the job... and you already hit the jackpot. What's he like? Minks the killer? We get along. That was quite a scene he made. What did you call him? Killer? Don't tell me you don't know? His wife was run down by a car years ago. It was a hit and run. So what? Of course it's just a rumor... They say Minks found him months later... and put a bullet in his head. Then there's the thing with his daughter. Don't just stand around, Schrader. Get busy! You've really getting along great. What a fucking mess! I'm gonna get you, you bastard. You can bet your life on it. Minks! Go home and get some sleep. I'm not finished here. That was an order. Don't let the press find out about the basement. You can count on it! Schrader will drive you home. My wife was killed in a car accident. Marie never got over her death. I guess I was no big help to her. And suddenly she was gone. She just didn't come back home. I have to find out what happened to her. You've gotta help me. If she is... still here... find her! Dinner's ready. I'll be right there. What're you looking for? Do you know her? Who's that? That's enough. Thanks. Looks great! It's Marie, Minks' daughter. She ran away two years ago. Two years ago? I know. But listen around anyway. Okay. Oh man! What do you mean? It tastes really... The victims have been identified. The first one was reported missing 3 years ago, the second 7 months later, the third 20 months later. There's no pattern. Was he alone? Gunzel. I mean, did he work alone? Petra? Cause of death? Cause of death? Cause of death? I am certain that... What did she say? What? - What did she say? I said all the victims were killed by the same person. A serial killer. State-certified. Is that Lynn Wilson's? We don't know yet. It'll take a few days. You can see how busy we are. Are you looking for something specific? I'm afraid I can't afford anything here. Let's take a walk. I was just closing anyway. You're new at this, aren't you? Why? Am I that awkward? You just don't seem like a cop. But who is what they seem? What I wanted to know... Did Lynn Wilson have a tattoo? Yes. Oh yeah? Was it a dragon? Yes, but I imagine you saw it. No, her corpse was burned to a crisp. Since when does the homicide department investigate accidents? Since we've known it wasn't one. How many do we have left? 10, 12. That's only half of what we found at Gunzel's. I thought it'd end the way it began. With a big bang. I think it'll be more like a whimper. If we knew who made them, maybe we could get to Gunzel. Can I help you? Thanks, we'll find the way. Hey, what's going on? Are you crazy? We're only after the film star. What if I know nothing? You get to wear my handcuffs. Fuck. I have no idea where he came from. Ask Martha. He came with her. The tattoed... girl where do I find her? This is Minks. Send the forensic people to Dante Street. Stop! Freeze! Police! Put your hands behind your head and stay down! Stay down! Put your hands up! Hands up, or I'll shoot! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! How do you feel? As you know, we have to investigate as we do with every homicide. Where's Minks? - Next door. Talk to your colleague first. You know each other. One more thing: Keep this to yourself until the investigation is completed. It won't take long if you play the game. But if you screw me, I'll screw you. So... How did you happen to shoot Norbert Gunzel? He shot himself, as you probably already know. Just the questions. Where was the gun? Did you drop it? Did he take it away from you? I was holding the gun. You were holding the gun? He shot himself with your gun while you were holding it? I hope you're enjoying yourself. Let me tell you the truth, Schrader... You have no business being here. Then I can leave, huh? I'm not through with you yet. But I'm through with you. Am I under arrest? Otherwise I can leave if I want to. You know what'll happen if you walk outta here? They'll never promote you. You can forget the homicide department. That's just what I wanted. Don't worry about it. It's just a formality. The most important thing is: Always come back home alive. I'm out. Do your hair test if you like. That way I can just quit after my leave. If I hear about your daughter... Police! Up against the wall! Spread your legs! Stop staring! And get something! Here! I'll get a doctor. I got all I need... What happened? Come on, man. I wanna help you! Mind your own business! Alright, Stefan Kreiner. That's all I got left. I need it... for the pain. Tell me everything. It's not what it looks like. There's nothing illegal about it. It's my choice! All the better. - Wait, man! Fuck! Wait a sec, man. Wait a sec. Whenever I'm broke I call this guy... What guy? - This... this lawyer. And he gets me an appointment with a dermatologist. Yeah? - And... I sign an agreement. I sign an agreement, a completely legal agreement. And it says that I do this voluntarily. And that I can't talk about anything. You understand? You do what voluntarily? I sell him... I sell him my tattoos, you know? I sell him my pictures. He buys them off you? It's his business. Others do it, too. What's this lawyer's name? What's his name? - Schoubya. Frank Schoubya. Gimme that. Give it to me! Tea... - Nice. Sorry, I interrupted you. - Sorry. No, thanks. It's nice here. Thanks, but you didn't come for the view. No, I thought you could tell me about Lynn's tattoo. Sure... Lynn got her tattoo in New York, right? It was a Japanese master, in the classical style: Hiromitsu. Classical style? The classical era of Japanese tattoos was between the 17 th and 18th centuries. The Japanese have little interest in naked bodies. The purity of virgin skin means nothing to them. The Hiromitsu He only did 12 tattoos. This is Lynn's. Number 3. They are true works of art. The Japanese passion for tattoos led people to collect skin. Collectors bought pictures from the living and waited for them to die. Skin collectors. - Just myths, of course. I doubt they're true. That Hori... Hiromitsu. - Yes. He died. It's probably impossible to find out who has the other 11 tattoos. Not at all. But I'd like to know what this has to do with Lynn's death. Nothing. Just curious. Actually I'm not supposed to give you this stuff. Since you're on leave. Yeah, I know. It's just for my report. Oh well. The case is closed. And anyway, you played a part in it, too. Yeah? Yeah, did you check the list of names? Just a sec. I got Lynn Wilson. I need the other 11 people with a Hiromitsu. Yes. And all of them are reported dead or missing? Thanks. Thanks. Schrader. Schrader! You aren't needed here. Dix. How observant. Black. Damn it! What do you want? You're on leave, and the Gunzel case is closed. Gunzel was no serial killer. Not in the usual sense. He was filling orders. And not just for Hiromitsu. Orders? From whom? Someone called Irezumi. There are collectors... Gunzel was just the tip of the iceberg. There are others... - Schrader! Gunzel was in prison. He couldn't have committed every murder. If it was murder! All 12 people with a Hiromitsu are reported dead or missing. Come on. 12 Has Gunzel's death been made public? Tomorrow. - We have to stop it. Until we know who's behind it. We? - Yeah, I wanna work the case again. What's the lawyer's name? Schoubya. Frank Schoubya. Call me by my first name, since we're spending time together again. I'll clear things with my superiors. I got him! What's going on here anyway? An old man was buried here yesterday. Last night, somebody dug him out and chopped him up. We've been looking everywhere for his head. Sometimes I don't understand the world anymore. How did you last this long? My family. No matter what, I went back home, and everything was okay. Can I ask you something? They say you found that hit-and-run driver. Yes, I found him. An insignificant state employee, living in a row house. I went into his bedroom at night. He was alone. I woke him up. I wanted him to know why. It was pathetic. He cried like a baby. I just couldn't do it. Sometimes I drive past his house at night when I can't sleep. He got married last year. Has a daughter of his own. If somebody always pays, who paid for your wife's death? I did. I paid for it. Now let's go after your Mr. Schoubya. Mr. Schoubya. Chief Inspector Minks. My colleague, Officer Schrader. Thank you for seeing us at such short notice. We have a few questions. Lynn Wilson, present residence: The state morgue. Familiar? Sorry, no. What about Stefan Kreiner? Present residence: Nowhere. A steady client of yours, I believe. I'm familiar with Mr. Kreiner. I prepared some contracts for him. What kinds of contracts? Sales contracts. Sales contracts for what, Mr. Schoubya? Listen, it's useless for me to play innocent. The contracts involved tattoos. I agree, quite unusual objects, but it's no reason to get upset. The transactions were legal and carried out by mutual agreement. So you negotiated for a third party, a collector. That's right. Who is the collector? - I regret. What does it cost to skin someone? I'm only a businessman. If you are planning to contact the D A in order to gain access to my files... No crime has been committed. So there's no necessity to reveal my client's identity. You're a businessman. So let's make a deal. A Hiromitsu. If your client is so hot on this shit, he can have this, provided he tells us something about the tattoo trade. It's too bad you folded it. That drastically lessens the value. Nevertheless, I'll see what I can do. You know this is material evidence. Did I say it wasn't? Either we do this together, Minks, or every man for himself. I'm hungry. How about you? I'll see you tomorrow. As you like. Yeah, what's up? What's so damned urgent anyway? Order me a beer at the bar. I'll be right there, okay? Sorry. Hey... 2 beers, please. Recognize her? I found her. Minks' daughter. Got it? She's been here since last Sunday. I didn't realize it until we talked to each other. Marie? This is Marc, the friend I told you about. Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. Can I have a beer? I have to talk to her. You really just want to talk? What if she doesn't want to? - What? Go back to her old man? Will you leave her alone? - Yeah. You'll leave her alone? - Yeah! Meltem said you know me? Yeah, we have a mutual acquaintance. This is getting ex citing. I know your father. I'm his partner. Shit. - Hey, don't worry. I'm here alone. Let me go. Let her go, will ya! - Shut up, okay? I'm not going back. - You know you're father's almost cracking up. He doesn't give a damn about me. Oh man. Shit. Want some chewing gum? Here, they make the best bubbles. What kind of cop are you anyway? A new reform-oriented generation. We're civilian friendly and practice painless police brutality. Hey? Are you gonna tell me what happened back then? I heard about your mother's accident. My father totally cracked up. He just couldn't understand why it had to happen to him. There was always a reason, a motive. Hey, I got so sick of hearing that crap. Then he started observing me even more than ever. He'd secretly watch me on my way home from school... I didn't want to run away, but he nearly smothered me with his love. I wanted to hurt him. I have my own life now. And I don't trust him. This is really not about me. I never was. It's all about him! What now? Will you report me? No. Don't worry. Gentlemen. - Is the collector here? Of course. This way. The deeply-felt beauty of an object and the sorrow of its transitoriness. Accepting the fleeting nature of existence, understanding that the transitoriness of Creation bestows it with value is the foundation of Japanese culture. Many collectors hide their pieces behind glass. I prefer to let them hang freely. It makes them come to life. Our society is in a transition. Instead of advancing away from the primitive... We are drawn back to our base natures. Some more than others. Stefan Kreiner, the junkie. Ironically, some of the most valuable artworks are on the most worthless bodies. What's in there? Everything needed to care for the tattoos. - Skin care? Interesting. We should get down to business now. I believe you have something with you. The pinnacle of tattoo art. Perhaps of all art. Absolutely priceless. Speaking of prices. Yes, you want to know who deals with tattoos. There are no traders. Only like-minded people. All the transactions are legal. The tattoos come from the families of deceased owners. Or from voluntary sales, like with our mutual friend, the junkie. There's no shortage of his type. What if someone refuses. I know what you're getting at... illegal goods. I know the rumors. I'm a collector, not a hunter. Whatever you're looking for has nothing to do with me. No skin off your back. I'm sorry. I know you were hoping for more. Not really. The masterpiece of my collection. Are you crazy? You're in possession of stolen property and suspected of committing a theft. What are you saying? Your masterpiece was stolen yesterday from the forensics department. Mr. Schoubya, I've been waiting a lifetime for a guy like you. You won't get away with this. Not with your means of investigating. That's right, but it's enough to get a search warrant. Within an hour, I'll have you hounded by reporters. Your playroom will appear in every newspaper's "Better Homes" section. I'll have you, your reputation and all your like-minded people incinerated. I'll pull you down so far you won't recognize the world anymore. I'll pull your skin over your ears. Now talk! Some traders and collectors aren't very particular about the voluntary aspect. Who are they? They don't know each other. Everything is organized in an anonymous chat room where skins are auctioned, always available and for everyone. Only hand-picked initiates are aware of what really happens. Was Lynn Wilson's tattoo, Hiromitsu No. 3, also auctioned there? I also made a bid. 2 million, then I dropped out. Millions? Gunzel got 254,000, but who got the rest? Somebody who won't allow anyone to interfere with his business. Irezumi? Translate to "tattoo" in Japanese. No one knows more. At least I don't. You're a liar. - I was always overbid. That's why I couldn't resist when you offered me the Hiromitsu. I should have known. If everything is so secret, how did you find the chat room? I didn't. Irezumi found me. You first need a buyer or a supplier before you can get close to him. But since they only deal with Irezumi and not with each other, you can only discover their identity through Irezumi. The system is perfect. You'll never find him. But we'll get you for being an accessory. I want the boss. "Tattooing" in Japanese... Take it nice and slow! You lied to me. All your questions about Lynn's tattoo. She was killed for her tattoo. What about you? Did you tell me the truth? I thought there were 12 Hiromitsus. I wish it were so. You were together? You and Hiromitsu. I loved him. So much I didn't care that love meant something different to him. We were so happy. Until his masterpiece was finished. He lost interest in me. He lost interest in everything. In life as well. He killed himself. Attained absolute perfection. And left me behind with a wound that won't heal. Ironically, I'm the only thing that's left of him. So Lynn Wilson knew about your tattoo? Of course, but she swore never to tell anyone about it. Before ending up in Gunzel's basement. Gunzel most likely knew about her tattoo and whoever else worked with him. Irezumi, too. Who else knows about it? Your family? Your lover? No one. Your silence has saved your life. Until now. Now you need us, and we need you. There's only one way to catch that maniac. Hold on. By offering him something he can't refuse. You aren't serious! We have no other choice. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? He wants to use you as bait. You what? - It's your only chance. Put me out there like a piece of meat. You came to see us. Don't get her involved! She already is! You wanted to solve this case. Not at her ex pense. And we'll solve it. Always you! And if it's the last thing I do. You just can't be trusted. What? Here's a package. Speak up! Who's it for? For you, Inspector Minks. From somebody named Irezumi. I'll put it here. Oar keys and a parking-lot ticket. No. What's wrong? What's wrong? Speak up! Marie. Marie? - I found her. I promised her not to tell you. What're you saying? This is Marie's tattoo. Don't go. Don't go there! Shit! Schrader. Call out a large-scale search for H. K. Minks. Yes, Minks! Schrader. What a shame. But it had to end this way someday. I didn't think anyone knew where she was. How the heck did they find her? You're not serious. We just have to see your face. We only need this here. That's how Gunzel probably contacted Irezumi. We' II get him. He can't pass this up. Maya, it's just a matter of time before you're discovered. You don't understand a thing. I'll keep my eye on you. Nothing will happen to you. You thought differently yesterday. Damn it... yesterday! I led him to Minks' daughter. What if something goes wrong? How long will you stay? A week? A month? Then you'll be gone, and I'll be free for slaughter. You are already. Gentlemen... Now the back. What if he doesn't get in touch? Don't worry. He won't pass up this opportunity. Go on. Talk to her. Irezumi! Take the suitcase to Convention Center, place it in a v an with the number 1969. We have to put something in it. Lynn's tattoo, the 3rd Hiromitsu. When's the ex change? - Midnight. Just one more hour. Come on. I'm here. Do you have me? I see you. The transmitter's working. Midnight. Okay, Poscher, let's go. Take the suitcase and get out. Check if one of the vans has the number 1969. I got it. Try the doors. There's a disturbance. - Poscher? I'll go to the rear. Poscher? Can you hear me? Poscher, come in, please! Poscher! Move in! A lamp! Stay up here. We'll only shoot each other down there. Shit. Congratulations. How could anybody fuck up so much in one night? Poscher? Dead. The 3rd Hiromitsu? Stolen. And Maya? Disappeared without a trace. What? But her apartment was under constant surveillance. They made sure nobody entered, not whether someone left. She was gone, when the replacement came. I don't get it. Why leave our protection and put herself in danger? I didn't get it at first either. Until this arrived. What is it? The Hiromitsu file. It took our colleagues in New York sometime to find out who the pseudonym was. As it turns out, he didn't commit suicide like your girlfriend claimed. He didn't? He was murdered. Skinned. It was never solved. The colleagues think that it was a kind of Personal vengeance, because the murderer or murderess took several days to skin him. Now guess who left New York a day after the murder, even days before the press found out. She lied to you. Probably from the beginning. She played with you like a cat with a mouse. She screwed you and whoever worked with her. Where is she? Where is she? - Who? No. No... Where is she? Wait! Where is she? - No. Please, don't. No. This won't get you anywhere! I'm meaningless. You didn't accomplish anything. Untertitel John Middleton Film und Video Untertitelung Gerhard Lehmann AG
