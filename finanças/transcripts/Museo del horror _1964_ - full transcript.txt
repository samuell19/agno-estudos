Good night, sir. "MUSEUM OF HORROR" I don't want to hear any excuses. The murderer has left no track, Commissioner. I know, but there are already three missing women. We've found no witnesses, not one. Enough! I don't need excuses, I need action! My bosses are furious, and now take a look at this. "Another Girl Disappears, Police Powerless" These disappearanoes have to be stopped, one way or another. This is horrible! Another victim. This town is so unkind! Girls disappear all the time. At the age of twenty, it's easy to fall into love affairs. I have my own theory. The three girls disappeared at the same time, and they were young and beautiful, so there is only one culprit. Or three boyfriends, no? You actors are such cynics. Well, I was an actor, now I'm just the manager of a theater. I insist that there is only one culprit. Stop gossiping and give me some more soup. Mr. Abramov, your manners are ugly. I've paid my rent. I just hate female gossip. Good afternoon. Why are you so late? We had an emergency. I presume he is dead, no thanks to you. No, hopefully he will live. Unusual. All the hospital is shocked by the news of another missing girl. I'm leaving. God made a mistake attaching tongues to women. Well, I'm leaving too. lwant to open the museum early. Some experts from the city are on the way lo admire my collection of stage actresses. - So, you have a new figure? - Huh? No, all the same. I'll come to visit you one of these days. Anytime. Please excuse me. It saddens me that such a great actor would now have that job. An accident put an end to his great career. I offered to introduce him to my teacher Dr. Barrios. I think if it was operated on, he could recover. And what was his response? He doesn't expect anything from life. Too bad. He is quite charming. This is one of the first major American theaters. Here, large European troupes have performed, as well as many great national artists. This is a national landmark jewel. Join me, please. Now, I will show you a famous collection. The great artists, characterized in the roles that brought them to stardom. Follow me, please. She is Hedda Gabler, the great character of Ibsen. A tortured and bizarre woman. She has to kill, or be killed. Marguerite. Faust sold his soul to Satan for her. And there, George Sand, Chopin's muse. - There are only female characters here? - Indeed, ma'am, that's it. I have created this museum, and I have modeled every character with my hands. It's women that I most admire. - You are gallant. - And sincere. Why aren't these shelves being used? They are awaiting the arrival of their characters. Elektra will be there. Her guilty love caused a great tragedy. And there, the sad and tortured Lady of the Camellias. And here... Here, the sweet Juliet. The Immortal Beloved. - This will complete the collection. - Oh, that emotion! You're very kind. Come this way, please. He came from there, and the woman disappeared on this very site. - Do you have a theory, Commissioner'? - I have. But first, check every house. Somebody must have seen something or at least heard it. Let's go. Remember when we mel? It's unforgettable. You pulled my hair and I cried. And when you sat down, you crushed my new hat. A truly unromantic first meeting. At the age of seven, you were the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. - You treated me bad. - But I haven't made you cry since. Oh, you did! The day you went to the city to study. I was alone, there was no one left to argue with. See? The memories we share. And the attraction we share. - Just that? - ls it a small thing? I need more, even more from you. I don't like plans, they are rarely met. I have faith. Nothing. Let's move on. This is useless. Only the deaf and blind live in this neighborhood. No one saw or heard anything. If you had my experience as a cop, you would understand that success is the result of luck, and lots of patience. - Patience? - Let's go. - If you need me, I'll be in the lab. - Yes, Doctor. - And I hope you need me. - Let me think about it. You know, this is my free night? - Good for you. - We could hang out. I didn't sleep well. If you want me to, I can take your sleepiness away. That sounds dangerous. I think there's a new singer at The Dove. I've heard great things about her. - And cute? - I can't lell. Let's find out together. Good evening, Doctor. What are you doing here? - I work as night watchman, and stuff. - Good for you. I saw you oorne in. I've come to ask you a favor. - Sure. - Can you spare some money? Here, but remember that wine does not make good medicine. Works for me. Thank you. Good evening, Ms. Marta. Good evening. Shall we dance? Excuse me, ma'am. See you, daddy. Aren't you forgetting something? Correct, daddy. - Hello, Lencho. - How have you been? I'm not complaining. Marta, I'm about to open the doctor's office, and I'll need a couple of things. A cute nurse, and a good wife. - Yeah? - The needs of any reputable doctor. That's nice. Think of the savings! Both roles played by the same person. Very economical. You're the one. What do you think? Let's move, or they will think that we are pan of the show. Mafia! These people sleep early, eh? - What about you? - Me? I think I'll do the same. This place has no potential. What about me? Put it on my lab. Please excuse me, but I can'! escon you home. - An emergency has just occurred. - Don't worry. Attend to your work. Excuse me. - I'm going to bed. - Can I go with you? I think not. You have no money. Nice merchandise, eh? This time it will be 200 pesos more. Yeah. 200 pesos more? I can't afford that amount. Cops are everywhere. It was very risky to get this corpse. My work is very imponant. These oorpses mean that one day, people will live longer and with less suffering. Sounds very romantic, Doctor. But we believe in the here and now, and for that we need the money. Yeah. Here it is. - When do we come back? - I'll let you know. - Now clear out, will you? - It's our pleasure to serve you. Please excuse us. Light my fire, handsome. - Good evening, Abramov. - Evening. I couldn't find my coat, so I used the doctor's. Excuse me. Thank God you are here, Doctor! - Hello, Lencho. - I went to the hospital, but you didn't show. Yeah... I had a patient to visit. - What's wrong with you? - Sonia... - Who is she? - My best friend. - Is she sick? - A man has stolen her! Can you explain this? She was on her way home. I was following her, because I care, when suddenly a man appeared, and just took her! I tried to follow them, but both vanished into thin air! - Did you see this? - I did! You haven't discussed this with anyone, right? - No. - OK, Lencho, wait right here. He died from poisoning. I'm sure that the tip of this dan contains curare. Curare? Highly active poison, extracted from the maracure root. Yes, I know. A common plant in South America. I think your specialty is embalming, and for that certain poisons are used. If you are suggesting that I know of curare, yes, I do. Indeed, in my room is a full bottle. Take the corpse out of here. Yes, ma'am. I'm a singer at the club. I have been told that your house is better than the hotel and much cheaper. This is my more cheerful room. The hotel makes me sad. Come with me. Let me introduce you to the crowd. I have the pleasure to introduce you to miss... - Norma Lamar. - Nice to meet you. Have a chair, miss. We'll talk about the fee after you've tasted my food. - Thanks a lot, ma'am. - Where is Luis? He has said something about an emergency. Excuse me. I startled you? Yes. This place has a creepy atmosphere. It does. The mystery of the theater, a bit of its magic, and all those memories. I came to see you. I can't be quiet about what happened to Lencho. Don't worry. The police are taking care of it. Why haven't you shown up for dinnef? Because of my work. I've got to prepare three more figures. Elektra, Margarita and Juliet. - Can I stay with you? - Yes, of course. Come in. This is my world. It seems like wonderful job. How did you get the idea to dedicate your life to this? - I was an actor. - I know, the most famous of all. In every show I did, I fell in love with the heroine. And when I couldn't work anymore, I felt it necessary to surround myself with the characters I once loved, although they lack a soul. - That's how the museum was born. - It's admirable. Indeed, it's an escape. A sad escape for a crippled man. - No, you are the most -- - Please don't say it. You are kind, but still too young. Maybe you don't notice, but I'm a real woman. Yes, you are. The day you love a man, you will be Juliet. - The ideal beloved. - I'm in love. Good for Raoul. A great guy. I'm not in love with him! No? So, who's the lucky man? Do I have to say it? - Nonsense! - It's the truth! Why don't you understand the situation? I'm a cripple, a loser! I am the opposite of what you should love. A mass psychosis has taken over the city. Disappearances of women will continue, and the police admit their incompetence. It's not recommended that any young woman go out unaccompanied after dark. This is what happens when the police fail to do theirjobs. Calm down, miss. I'm the Commissioner. Good evening, sir. I beg you to allow one of my men to walk you home. - Some strange events have occurred -- - I know. I appreciate your concern. At your service, miss. - Good evening, Commissioner. - Good evening. I'm sorry, Raoul. It's not fair to hide il. I appreciate it, but I think you're wrong. No! You're sick of romance. - He inspires your pity. - Don't say that. Yes, you'll back to me soon. I can wait as long as it takes. Don't make it harder, Raoul. Please. But, Marta, we've known each other since childhood! And sinoe then we played at being lovers. That game turned out to be my faith and my destiny. I became a doctor because of you! You encouraged me! Now, I work hard to be a successful man. One whom you can be proud of. Now, you want my dreams to go up in flames! I'm sorry. I'm confused, but I can't fool you. You're mine, Marta. You will always be. I'll not allow him to steal my reason for living. Forgive me. I don't have to forgive you. You will return to normal soon. To the reality where only I exist. And remember one thing, I'll fight to death for you! Good evening, Doctor. Are you sick? - Hurry up! - I'm working! Freeze! Who are you? What are you doing here? We're honest people, Offioer. You can prove that at the police station. - Let's go! - Wait! Let's make sure he's dead. He has seen our faces. He can no longer speak. - Let's go! - Wait! We must do things the right way. Help me out. This body will never be found! - He moved! - Don't be a coward! Let's bury him. Marta! What's the matter? Why were you screaming? A terrible nightmare! Calm down, my dear. It's over now. Here is the place of the first abduction. Let's put a mark on all of them. It's evident that the kidnapper only operates in this sector of the city. He must know the area very well. How else could he drag a body without being seen? It's as if he could disappear in a flash. OK, he could live in any of these houses. No, I don't think so. Each of these houses has been inspected. And all are inhabited by honorable families. Then, what is the escape route? This is the only possible way. - The graveyard. - Yeah. If we focus the surveillance on the graveyard, we just might catch this guy. Agreed. If you permit me, I'd like to take charge of the surveillance operation. OK, but be careful. Of course, Commissioner. I have four kids. This reinforces the idea that the graveyard is the key. I insist on my plan, Commissioner. No. We can't lose any more men. I will take great care, I promise. OK. Either way, those murderers will pay. - Hello. - Hello. I knew you'd come. Yes, I wanted to say that our love is impossible. Where there's a will, there's a way. A man must have something to offer his wife. I have nothing. Have you ever thought that a woman always wants to be with the man she loves? Always? In real life "always" makes no sense. I don't know. I'm a simple girl who doesn't understand philosophy. But I know what I want. And I want you. Can you walk me home? If the kidnapper decides to act by day, I don't want him lo see me alone. Curare, once again. The very same procedure. The same murderer. I'll do the autopsy, so I'll establish the approximate time of death. Thanks, Doctor. - He was a good man. - Yes, the best. - Who will tell his wife? - I will. I'll say something else as well, I'll hunt that beast down even if it kills me. I don't know what you're laughing about. Sorry, Mom. lfind it funny that you treat me like a child. And you think you're a woman? I am, so I have a few secrets. Secrets? A daughter is supposed to be completely open to her mother! - I know you're in love. - You know? You think I haven't noticed those glances at Raoul? And the way he stares at you? I'm no fool. You're not a fool. You're the greatest mom in the world. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening, Professor. - Evening. You look tired. Yes. I'm perfecting a new technique for embalming. - Don't you know another subject? - Don't ask me. Tell Raoul that the dinner is sewed. One moment. I'm sorry you can't stay. How is your work doing? Progressing. Very soon I could show you some results. I'll be glad to hear it. I have confidence in your talent. Mafia! Please... Mr. Abramov. - You have a phone call. - Thanks. What are you hiding there? Don't you have any respect for privacy? - I was curious. - The curious always finish badly. Stay away from what is not your business. That temper of yours. Oh, boy! Hello! I thought you were at the hospital? I finished early and thought I'd enjoy some high culture. - Who's this? - Elektra. One of the great characters of Greek tragedy. She doesn't seem important headless. She's been modeling. It's been quite difficult. She must have grandeur, beauty and violence, all at once. Can I take a peek at the sculpture? - Are you interested? - If you find it interesting, so do I. My plan is to stay with you for life. It's also my plan. Together... always. The facial features are still vague. Soon she will be finished. And she'll be Elektra in the flesh. Of course it requires work, inspiration, but I know what I want. You are very talented. No. Look at what I am. And where I am. You are in the right place. Next to me. Are you sure there's not a back doon'? No, Commissioner. I have worked 5O years at the cemetery, and I've never seen another way out. Mafia! Forgive me. I didn't mean to scare you. Have you been waiting for me? Well, not really. Ifsjust, since we're both going home, do you mind if I accompany you? Of course. We're not enemies. Of course not. Mafia. Are you sure of what you're doing? I don't want to stress the point. Believe it or not, the idea of hurting you makes me ill. OK. I promise you I won't mention it again. Ijust wanl you to know, I don't think I lose you. I love you, and I will do anything. What's this? Oh, Lord! - Thank God you're here! - What's the matter, Mom? - I know who killed Lencho! - What? - I think I know who the assassin is! - Calm down, Mom. - Your heart can't handle such excitement. - I know, dear. I know. - Did you call the police? - No, I was waiting for you! Calm down, and tell me about it. I felt sick, so I went to Raouls room and then I saw -- Mom! Hello! Hello! - Blood... - He's hurt. - Is this the phone? - I tried to use it but it didn't work. No, miss. It had been cut. - Are you feeling OK? - Just a little shocked. I've never been so scared. - I'm concerned about Mom. - She's merely fainted. She'll be fine. - We have to take her to the hospital. - Can I go with hef? Sure you can. One moment, miss. Did you see the faoe of the man that attacked you? - It wasn't a man. - I'm afraid I'm not following you. I know it can't be, but under his hat was a mummified face. I'm not crazy. I'm telling the truth, I swear! Come, miss. Nobody is allowed to enter this house. Stay put. As the guests arrive, send them to the police station. OK, sir. I want to believe in you, but mummies don't steal or kill women. I already said all I know. Did you notice anything to indicate that it was a disguise? It was a hideous faoe, with teeth shining in the darkness. The worst has passed. Can I talk to her, Doctor'? It's very important. We've sedated her. She won't be talking until tomorrow. Hopefully it won't be too late and the murderer won't escape. I'll send you home with one of my men. Thanks. - On your way. - Yes, sir. Doctor, can a mummy kidnap women? I don't have time for jokes! - To your home, miss? - No. To the theater, please. To the theater. Luis! Luis! Luis! Luis! Luis! Luis! What's happened? I needed you close to me. Due to work, I didn't notice the time. Did you finish Elektra? I did. Now tell me, what's wrong? Mom has figured out who the murderer with the dans is! Did she tell the police? She couldn't. Someone tried to kill her and she fainted. Then, I went to the street, crying for help... Calm down. I'm with you now. Nothing will happen to you. A cup of coffee may do you good. Come. I want you to tell me what you did with that skeleton. You have no right to interrogate me. We will talk about it later. This case is full of suspects. I demand the truth. Speak! Step forward, Doctor. - Good evening. - Good - Something wrong with your arm? Yes, Inspector. A minor dislocation. I hurt myself when loading a heavy bag. Nothing serious. Are you sure about the dislocation? Yes. Can it be a gunshot wound? I just explained it to you. I got hurt because of a heavy bag. Maybe. Do you know my men managed to hun the murderer in his escape? Are you insinuating that I -- No, I can't imply. I must simply present evidence. Well, Inspector, can you tell me why I'm here? To talk. You do experiments, do you not? Yes. I dedicate all my free time to them. The authorities have given you a small lab. Indeed. And you don't allow anyone to enter. No. My job is important and requires privacy. Are you experimenting on cadavers? Enter! Do you know these men? No. And do you know these men? No. Never seen them in my life. Take them away. Doctor, it's best for you to tell me the truth. Commissioner, you have to prove your accusations. You don't really need the cane! I'm sorry you had to discover this. This wasn't part of the plan. Me! I'm smarter than them! Nobody can beat me. Nobody! No, why you? Why did you have to do this? Come! Look at them! Look at them! I have created them all. They look like wooden figures, but no, on the inside of each there's a human being! A beautiful human, once alive. - No, shut up! - Come! - I don't want to listen to you. - Look at them. They are all mine! Every one is mine! When we're alone, they talk to me. I act for them, and they admire me. Because I'm the greatest artist in the world. You're crazy. Crazy! Don't say that, Juliet. My beloved Juliet, don't talk to me that way. I love you, but I can't let death destroy your beauty. You will be immortal, and you will occupy a glorious spot. You are sick, Luis. I will take good care of you. There... there on that basing. You will become the ultimate Juliet. And I will love you, love you sweetly... tenderly... wildly! You have to listen to me, Luis. I'm Marta, the woman you've chosen. You will oorne with me. I can help you. No! Nobody wants to help me. Everyone makes fun of me. They think that I'm done as an actor. You're hurt! Yes. They tried to stop me with their guns. But they can't beat me. Come, Luis, let's go to the police. No, that's enough! Enough! I'll tell you the truth. I sell these skeletons to students and doctors. It's a way to make a living, like any other. OK, Professor. You may go now. But we will talk again tomorrow. You will be taken home in a police carriage. Thanks. Thank you very much. You can go as well, Doctor. But don't leave town. Don't you WOFFY- All will be sweet, like a dream without end. I thought you loved me, Luis. Why do you want to kill me? It's life that I'm offering you. Everlasting life. This will put you lo sleep. Then, little by little, your mortal body will became like marble. No, for God sake! Don't do it! I adore you, Juliet. Mafia. Mafia. Mafia! THE END
