This is the story of a time long ago, a time of myth and legend, when the Earth was still young. The ancient gods were petty and cruel, and they played mankind for their sport, plaguing them with suffering, besieging them with terrors. For centuries, the people had nowhere to turn, no one to look to for help, until... he arrived. He was a man like no other, born of a beautiful mortal woman but fathered by Zeus, king of the gods. Hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart. But everywhere he went, he was tormented by his stepmother, Hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods. Hera's eternal obsession was to destroy Hercules, for he was the constant living reminder of Zeus' infidelity. No matter the obstacle, as long as there were people crying for help, there was one man who would never rest: Hercules! HERCULES THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS Hercules? Don't try to speak. Let me get you some place warmed. Wait out here. Father? Father! Fa...! Wait! Let me in!!! Hercules. Hercules and the Circle of Fire You sure you want to come in here? I'm sure. We keep going. These were all young men from my village. The witch who guards the fountain killed them for their youth, their strength. To prolong their own foul life. Hercules, you have to end this terror. - If I lead you to the fountain... - I'll take care of the witch, like I said I would. Kill her, Hercules! Kill the witch! Help me. Now, Hercules..., I will have the greatest strength of them all. Yours. No!!! It's all right. You're safe now. Please, let's leave. I want to go home. Not yet. All right. Now we can go. Grab my hand! Come on. Well..., you're just in time. I don't think... I could have made it without you. And you say your father never helps, huh? What have we here? Thank you, Hercules. Thank you for resucing me. Excuse me, miss, but, uh..., you know, I... helped too. You're not quite out of danger yet. Not 'til I get you away from this old man here. I'll be fine. My village is just through the trees there. Thank you. Good-bye. Good-bye. Huh. Any more of those down here? No, I'm a... I'm afraid that's the... last one. Oh, just my luck. What are you doing down here? I, uh... I came for this. It's a... potion... to cure Cheiron's wound. At least that's what I hope. Always helping people. You know, son..., I wish we could spend more time together. I'd love to. - You would? - Yeah. Listen..., I know this beautiful mountain. We could talk and talk... Nobody knows about it. Not even... Hera. Well, that sounds exactly like what I need. We could be there... in a few seconds. Well, I, uh... I can't go right now. I've... gotta get back with this potion. You care more about your friend than your father, huh? No. I don't. I can't. We'll do it soon. Soon. Hey. - Next time. - All right. - I promise. - Good. There may not be a next time. Stop! If you're a friend, you'll know the password. And if you're a foe, you'll know the bite of our swords! No, don't. No, please, uh... I'm a friend. Is... Is the password... "minotaur"? Is the... password "argonaut"? Is the password... "tickle"?! It's no fair, Hercules, no fair! That's not the password! All right, men! Take me to your leader. Father, Father, look who's here! It must be someone special, the way you two are carrying on. Sorry to disappoint you, Cheiron, it's only me. Ah! Such a surprise, I didn't expect it. I almost didn't make it. I barely got past your guards here! Did I hear someone say "Hercules"? Amalthea, how are you? Cheiron. You didn't tell me your son was born already. That's because he hasn't another son. He's got a daughter. Her name's Kora. Look at her. She's beautiful, just like her mother. Well, that's just got you invited for dinner. And if you two are finished, you should head off to bed. Oh, we want to stay. - We want to hear stories! - Hmm. It's just a little bit late for stories tonight, so go no now, you two. Atta boy. - Good night, Hercules. - Good night, Hercules. Good night, boys. How's your wound? Oh, it's not too bad. Maybe a little worse. Well, I've got something here to change all that. Another cure, Hercules? This one's going to work. I can feel it. I appreciate your efforts..., but we have tried everything. We haven't tried this. Here. Oh, it would be nice to be whole. To be a real father..., a real husband. Anything? No. Nothing. Wait a minute, I feel something. It's working. It's working, Hercules! I knew it! I knew this cure was the one! - Maybe it needs more time. - No... Or a bigger dose. No. You've done enough. I just want to forget about it. Oh, what was that? How about... when that palace guard tried to stop you? Poor guy never knew what hit him. Ah, those were better days. You know, back then I used to think there was nothing better than being immortal..., knowing I'd live forever. Do you remember how I used to brag about it? I remember. Ah, I suppose if I'd known my fate... was going to be to live like this forever... Oh, hey, I... Uh... I didn't mean it like that, really. Nah, I just meant..., I shouldn't've done so much bragging, that's all. Still, you've got Amalthea and the kids. They're pretty great. Yeah. You know, the more I love 'em..., the more it's gonna hurt to watch 'em all grow old and die someday. Immortality... What I wouldn't give just to grow old and die with them. Hercules, what's happening? Something's wrong. Look, it's happening all over the town. The fires are dying. Cheiron, what's going on?! It's suddenly so cold. Hercules, why would all the fires be dying? Not all the fires. Look there. I don't understand what's happening. Neither do I. But I'm going to find out. No, you can't come in! Please, just let us come in. Our fires have died, yours are still going. Just let us in. I said no! So be gone. Get away from here, all of you! But these people are desperate and cold! You have to let us have some of your fire! Look, we don't have to do anything of the kind. All right. Look, just let me light this, and I'll restart their fires! I told you, I can't help you. This fire is for the great goddess Hera. Oh, some great goddess! She's not lifting a finger to help this people! None of your damn gods do! You can't come in. All right. What if I pay? Exactly... what have you got in mind? I'm thinking, uh..., a hundred dinars. - Fifty dinars. - Fifty dinars? - All right, fine, then fifty dinars. - No, w-w-wait, wait. I said... You said fifty dinars! Yeah, I-I did, but I-I wasn't agreeing to, uh, to fifty dinars. Okay, fine, then thirty dinars! No, I-I didn't say thirty. I said fifty. I mean... You think of yourself as an intelligent man? Well..., I like to think so, yeah. Well, then you would think that twenty dinars would be a good deal! - No, w-w-wait, wait. - Fine, then twenty dinars it is. You drive a hard bargain. You can keep your money. These fools don't deserve a single dinar. I'll get the fire you need. Excuse me?! I thought I was doing a pretty good job here. What do you propose to do? Hera's vermin keep warm while everyone else is cold? That's not gonna work. Stop! This is sacrilege! I'm gonna light this from your fire. If that bothers you, then look the other way. What are you doing? You have to talk to these people, you need to negotiate with them. Where Hera's scum are concerned, this is negotiating. I hit them, they hit the floor, deal's done. Now if you excuse me, I'll, uh, be right back with your fire. You have defiled the sanctity of Hera's temple. I don't know who you are..., but you're not getting out of here alive. Then you're right. You don't know who I am. Kill him! What are you waiting for?! He angered the gods. Oops. All of you! Kill him! Here you go. No trouble at all. You fools! That torch will do you no good. Hera is destroying all fire! This sickness you call mankind has offended her long enough! Soon your world will be frozen. Not one of your wretched souls will survive. Do you see what you have done? You have taken what little hope these people have and destroyed it! I destroyed it?! I was trying to help you! We didn't want your help. We didn't even need your help! How can this be? Do you know what will happen if all fire dies? No mortal will survive. I can't bear to lose my family. I don't want to be alone again. I know. I won't let that happen. I'm gonna find out what Hera's up to and put a stop to it. I'm coming with you. Cheiron, you can't. Hercules..., I was a great warrior once... and I fought great battles. Now, instead of a sword..., I carry this. I'll find a way to bring back fire. I promise. Cheiron, Deianeira is here. She says she needs to see you. Cheiron, I-I'm sorry to disturb you, but I need your help. There's nothing I can do. But you're immortal, and you know the ways of the gods. - Please. - Deianeira, I'm crippled. There's only one man that can help you..., and that's Hercules. Hercules. Of course. Do you know where I can find him? You're Hercules? You can't be. Huh. You must be mistaken. He's not mistaken. - I am Hercules. - Then we're in big trouble. - Look, uh, miss... - Deianeira. Well, look, Deianeira, I'm gonna find out what's happening to fire and put it back the way it should be. Hmm. I can feel it getting warmer already. Look, I need to find where Prometheus lives. What? Prometheus is the god of fire. I would think that'd be a good place to start. But you think you're just gonna casually walk over there - and drop in on him? - I'm going to try. It's a long way, it's not an easy trek. - Then you know where he lives. - Yeah, I do. Great, then you can take me there. What happened to "I didn't want your help, I don't need your help"? It's turned into "I don't want your help, but I have no choice". When get to Prometheus, I think it's best if I do the talking. Why is that? Because if I let you do the talking, you won't. You'll try to smash his skull and then something, and... violence always causes more trouble than it solves. Oh, I don't know. Some things in this world respond better to fists. - Simple as that. - Well, try talking once in a while, you might be surprise. So, Cheiron tells me you own most of the land in this town. Why do you care? Oh, I'm just trying to do a little talking. Everything from the foothills to the Aerius River I inherited from my father when he died. He was a great man. He was a great father too. Before he died, we used to talk about what he wanted to do with this town. Now, he really wanted to make it something. I had hoped to finish what he started, but it was tougher than I thought. But now I just, uh... Am I boring you? Oh, no. It's not that. Oh, yes it is. I know what interests Hercules. Slaying monsters, cracking heads and... rescuing a few maidens, the easy conquer now and then. Well, I guess you know all about me. Hmm. I know enough. Right. All right, let's talk about what does interest you: Cheiron. I want to know what happened to him. He has a wound that never heals, he's in constant agony. But I thought if you were immortal, you were invincible. Oh, not if the wound is inflicted by someone else with immortal blood in their veins. He's gonna suffer like that for eternity? That's horrible. Oh, there's a... there's a cure for him out there somewhere. I just... haven't found it yet. We've been walking for hours, and this is where we end up? I thought you knew the way to Prometheus. This is the way to Prometheus. You can stay and rest, I'll be back down in a little while. And I, uh, promise I'll only... talk to him. Or you can make things a little more exciting by breaking your neck. Welcome to the house of Prometheus, last of the titans. Come on. You'll be a lot warmer inside. Prometheus! Prometheus, it's Hercules! Maybe you better wait out here. Ooh, it's colder in here than it is out there. Ooh. Do you ever do what people tell you to do? No. Do you? Well, just... stay behind me. Something is really wrong here. This place should be an inferno. In the name of the gods! Is he dead? Hercules. Yes, Prometheus, it's me. The torch. You must retrieve the torch. Wait, don't try to speak, I'll free you. No. It's no use. Listen to me. The Eternal Torch, it's been taken. You must get it back, do you understand me? You must get it back before the torch dies out. It was Hera who stole it, wasn't it? Yes. She's taken it to Mount Ethion. I took fire from the heavens so that man would have knowledge..., to help him grow. Don't let my efforts be destroyed! Go to Mount Ethion. Find the torch. Free it from Hera's evil grasp. Don't worry, Prometheus. I'll find the torch. My life is not the only one in your hands, Hercules. If the torch dies, all life dies with it. All of it. Throw all of it in. We need more. We need a greater sacrifice than this. I'm hungry. Why don't you see if those two are all right? What are you people doing? Making sacrifices. You'd be wise to do the same. So the gods will forgive us... and give back our fires. But your food is precious, you'll starve to death without it. Who might you be to tell us what to do? I'm Hercules. - Hercules? - Hercules? The Hercules? Please, Hercules, help us! - We're calling. We need fire! - The fire's gone! - Help us! - You've got to save us. I'm trying, I'm trying, but in the meantime, you need to stop throwing your food away. - It won't do you any good. - But the gods! Forget about the gods. Believe me, they don't care a bit about you. Sure, sure, Hercules! It's easy for you to go around disrespecting the gods. There'll always be a place at the table for you up on Mount Olympus! But we're at the gods' mercy. Our faith, our sacrifices, is all that stands between us and death! Leave us alone, Hercules. You know nothing about us! Go slay yourself a minotaur. Nothing sweeter than the smile on the face of a child. Unless, of course..., it's on the face of a beautiful woman. Hmm. You're not from around here, are you? No, I'm-I'm not. I would've remembered, uh, having met you. May I have the pleasure of... giving you a welcoming gift? - No, I couldn't take anything. - Please, it would... be something very simple. - Okay. - I call that... Deianeira Blossom. Deianeira's my name. - It is?! - Yes. Well, then... I've named it correctly. Thank you. - Hercules! - Oh. Hello, young man! Do you two know each other? Unfortunately. Excuse us a moment? Oh, excuse me. Father, you want to tell me what the hell's going on? That's quite a traveling companion you've got. Can we not talk about her right now? That's the kind of woman a man... dreams about. Look. What? Huh. How do you know about my dream? Well..., have you forgotten? I'm... king of the gods. Tell me, uh, are you, uh, are you two, uh..., uh... N-No, we're not... You will soon. Would you forget about her? I wanna know what Hera's up to. We're talkin' about a gorgeous woman! And you want to talk about... Hera?! - Yes. - Oh, come on. Father, she's stolen Prometheus' torch! She robbed the people of fire. Now, don't tell me the king of the gods didn't know about that. I want you... to forget about it! - Forget about it... - Yes, forget it! How can I forget about it? Don't you care about people? People all over the earth are... are gonna freeze to death. You don't give a damn, do you? You don't even care. Why do you think I spend so much time on Earth? Because I love people, people like your mother... and yourself. You know, when you were a child, you used to challenge me. No... I loved it! But now... you're a man. Don't you dare defy me. I say... stay out..., and you stay out. But... See you around, Father. So, who was that back where? Back where? You know who I mean, that kind old man. Ah, that was nobody, just my father. That was your fa... That was Zeus?! - You've gotta be kidding me! - A little bit let down, isn't it? Not exactly what you'd expect for the king of the gods. No! I-I just thought... I thought he'd be mean, even stern. But he was so... he was so nice, he was so charming. You didn't fall for those lines, did you? - It's all a disguise, believe me. - N-No, look, we have got to go back there and talk to him, all right? He could help us, he could bring back fire. Probably, but he won't. What's worse, he doesn't even want me to try. I-I don't understand. Neither do I. Still think he's such a... nice old man? Relax, I'll get you out. It's all right. Don't be frightened. Hercules, what was that? Hercules?! I don't know..., but she's gone now. - Hercules? You're... You're him? - Yeah. I was saved by Hercules, the one and only! Yahoo! Well, at least somebody's excited to meet me. I know all about the time you beat the Hydra... and when you fought the titans... and the time you killed the two-headed giant Typhis! Wait, where are my manners? Hi, I'm Phaedra. So, Phaedra, you wanna... tell us how a little kid like you ended up in that trap? I'm not a little kid. Okay! You wanna tell me... how a big kid like you ended up in that trap? Well, it's like this, I was walking along a path... when suddenly... a lion jumped out and started chasing me! It was gigantic! With big, sharp teeth... and huge claws... ready to slash me to ribbons! A lion... We didn't see any lion. Well, maybe it wasn't a lion. But it was at least a panther, that's why it was so fast. And it had huge, bloody tusks... dripping with blood! A panther... with... huge, bloody tusks... Oh, all right, already. I was just hungry. I was trying to get that bait out there. Kids like me do get hungry, you know? Well, kids like you should be in some place warm. - Where are your parents? - I ain't got no parents. Well, where do you live? Uh, I don't know, around. Well, then maybe you better come with us. - Where are you going? - To Mount Ethion. Really? And I can go with you? No. I'm afraid it might be a little dangerous, but we'll drop you off at the nearest town. - It's somewhere safe. - Oh yeah. Like that'd be a lot of fun. Pretty soon I'd have to go to school, and wear shoes, and comb my hair. No, thank you. But, Phaedra! Phaedra! Phaedra, wait! I thought you said you were going to Mount Ethion. - We are. - Then you're going the wrong way. You should be talking that path over there. It's a shortcut. Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. I'm always sure. Someone paved the way with stones. Well, I guess Phaedra knew what she was talking about. She certainly was a fan of yours. Yeah, nice kid. You know, I hate to say this, but you were so good with her, I really think someday you're gonna make a great father. With my life? I don't know. I'm always off to one place or another. I don't want a kid who'll grow up with a father who's never around. Is that what happened to you? Close enough. You mean, when you were younger, you really didn't... Look, maybe I didn't make myself clear earlier, but my father isn't something I really want to talk about. Well, maybe this is something you should talk about. Yeah, right. And with a woman who... thinks all the world's problems can be solved with talking. So if your father - is the king of gods, then... - I told you, I don't want to talk about him. I'm not talking about him, I'm talking about you. If your father is the king of gods, does that make you immortal? Maybe, maybe not. I have his immortal blood, but my mother's human, so I don't know what that makes me. Ah, that must be tough not knowing. Well, there is one sure way to find out, but... I don't think I'm ready to try it yet. What's that? I'm not sure. Come on. It's made out of bones. Those are human bones! Trophies. Hercules, do something! Me? I thought maybe you'd want to try talking to him. You have a nice skull. Oh, no. This is one of those things that responds better to fists. - Are you all right? - Yeah. If we ever see Phaedra again, remind me to kill her. Are you all right? Nobody beats Antaeus the Giant. Antaeus? Why can't I ever run into any nice giants? What the hell? Oh, Antaeus the Giant! What does his legend say? What is it? What is it?! Oh. He gets his strength from his mother. Uh... Uh, who's his mother? Who's his mother? Oh! Hercules, I have something to tell you. Deianeira! I'm a little busy right now. That is Antaeus the Giant! I think... we can skip the formal introductions. He gets his strength from his mother! Am I supposed to be interested in his family tree?! The earth is his mother, it's where he gets his strength; it replenishes him. Don't let him touch the ground. You did it. You did it. Come on. Let's go find some shelter. If I ever get my hands... on that little imp... She was such a sweet little thing. Do you really think that she knew that Antaeus would be waiting for us? No. I find it hard to believe someone could know about the shortcut and somehow miss him. - Let me see that. - Huh? Does that hurt? No, your hands are cold. Some hero. I barely beat him. Antaeus might've killed me if it hadn't been for you. Well, we would've found out if you were immortal or not. That was a joke. Thanks. Here. You'll be warmer this way. Are you the one? The one that wounded Cheiron? We were side-by-side in battle. It was dark, I mean, there was smoke everywhere. I mistook him for the enemy. I think I owe you an apology. You've been trying to help me, you've been trying to help everyone - and I've been pretty awful. - It's all right. Oh, but the things that I've said... Hey. Some of them were true. Besides, I should apologize too..., for snapping at you earlier, well, when... you asked about my father. The reason I didn't... tell you about my relationship with him was... just that: there isn't one to talk about. He's got the heavens and Earth on his shoulders..., and he never had time to think or care about me. Well, what do you say we start over? Friends? Sure. What else would we be? Well..., we better try to get some sleep. Yeah. - Good night. - Yeah. What is it? I thought I heard something. Never mind. Should I be getting worried? You... little...! Gotcha! Hold still, you demon! You sent us into those woods on purpose. Of course I did, it was a shortcut, I told you that. A giant nearly killed us. A giant? I-I didn't know about a giant, I swear! Oh, like hell you didn't! Please, don't let him hurt me. Hercules, don't you dare hurt her. I wasn't really going to hurt her, I was just trying to scare her for that stunt she pulled with Antaeus. I didn't know about him! Oh, you've gotta believe me! I was following you, I admit that, but I didn't know about the giant. Until he jumped out and attacked. Boy, he was really creaming you. Especially when he elbowed you in the face. Yeow! And then ooh! He punched your stomach! Oww! He bonked you on the head! But finally, just when it looked like you were licked, you grabbed him and... and lifted him into the air! Uh. All right. I was there, remember? Stop, before you strain something. Listen, we don't have time for this. We've got to get going. To the mountains, right? Yes, to the mountains. Then you need to know something. Up ahead, the path reaches a fork. If you're smart, you'll go to the right. Yeah? And what is it this time? A lake serpent? Some sort of gorgon? No. It's just a faster way to Mount Ethion. I swear for real this time. Yeah. Well, we'll see. But first, we're taking you to town... and you're gonna go to school... all day. You'll have to wear really tight shoes and comb that rat nest you call hair. No, no! You can't make me! Phaedra! Come out of here, I'm not done with you! Hey! Well, what do you think? Well, Phaedra said to go to the right. But then again, Phaedra also said to take a shortcut through the woods. Yeah, well, I don't think she knew anything about Antaeus, okay? Yeah. I mean, you're probably right. Why would she... want to tell us the wrong way? Maybe we should've taken the other path like Phaedra said. No, this is the right way, I'm sure of it. I guess. We haven't run into a single giant that wants to rip your head off yet. That's a good sign. You've got to be kidding me. She tricked us again, that little rat! That greep's doing this on purpose. She's working for Hera, she has to be. It's gonna take all day to get back to that other path. No. I think we can still cross. Oh, no. No. I can't. Why not? You climbed the rock up to Prometheus's house. Well, that was up! This is down! Deianeira, we have to. Hera will throw obstacles in our way wherever we go, whatever path we take. She'll never stop..., which means we can't either. Yeah. We can't either. Deianeira! Do me a favor. Don't look down anymore. I'm not looking down, I'm not looking down, I'm not looking down, I'm not looking down. Well, see? We're halfway there already. Nothin'... to worry about. Deianeira. You need to open your eyes and start crawling up. We're only a few feet from the the rest of the walkway. We almost died. I know. It's all right now. No, it's just that... almost dying has never really happened to me before. Well..., I try to do it at least once a day. Come on. Let's go. Look, they have fire. That must mean we're getting closer to the torch. Closer than you think. Look. It's Mount Ethion. - Can we get there tonight? - No, it's too dark. We'll stay here tonight. As long as there's a fire, we've still got some time. Why don't you go get yourself warmed up? - How are you doing tonight, sir? - Fine. - Any rooms available? - Sure. Can't offer you much of a fire, though. Damn thing seems to be dyin' away. Just one room for you and the missus? Sir? Uh, yeah. Yeah, uh, one room. - And make it your best. - Oh. I know just what you have in mind. Down the hall, left. Hope you enjoy your stay. I'd like a room for myself, as well. It was just a kiss on the cheek. I guess this is it. Uh, are you... sure you don't... want to, uh... - I mean, it... - Good night, Hercules. could get... pretty cold... Yep. Good night. Excuse me! I have just rented rooms for myself and my daughters here. However, upon inspection, we find they simply won't do. - They're cold. - Too cold! Y-Y-Yes. Yeah, too cold. Yeah. Unbearably frigid, if you ask me. I mean, just what kind of a shoddy operation - are you running here?! - Well, well, normally we have a fire in every room, sir, but... almost all our fires are out. Daddy, what about that one?! Yeah! What about that one? I'd like that fire moved to my room. Our room. Uh, but it's the only one left. I'd like it moved just the same! Sir, I'm afraid that's impossible. - I have an inn full... - Impossible?! Do you know who you are talking to? I am Thespius..., one of the most prominent citizens in all of Athens! Certainly you don't expect me and my lovely daughters to be... uncomfortable just because you have a little heating problem. Uh, sir, it's more than a little problem. Let me tell you something, my fur-covered friend. I have stayed in some of the finest... Get away! Look, we're not giving you any money, so go... on. You're all dirty! Shoo! So I guess you wouldn't care if I told you Hercules was staying here. - Wait! - Did you say "Hercules"?! He's the strongest man in the world. Oh, he's the handsomest man in the world. He's the son of a god. Oh, so you've heard of him. Deianeira? I can't believe you're here. I wouldn't be anywhere else. Who's there? Hercules. - Hmm. - Oh, wait for me! Ooh! Deianeira! Ooh! No, wait! Please, Deianeira. Look, uh... What... You don't understand! It was some sort of a... spell! I was tricked! No, I was tricked! I was starting to think that you were something special! But... Deianeira! I am! Please, Deianeira, you've got to believe me. And I don't have to do anything you say, all right?! Why don't you just go back to that bed with your dear fans?! I never want to see you again! Deianeira... Deianeira. Wait... I'm comin' with you. What happened to the fire? Oh, no! This time we won't stop until we find some proper lodgings! Hercules himself, I can't believe it! I nearly melted away, especially when he said I was so beautiful. He didn't even know your name. Oh, he did so! Yeah? So why'd he call you Deianeira? Why did he call me Deianeira? He called me Deianeira too. It's almost as if he thought we were someone else. Well... Hera's keeping you nice and warm, isn't she? Hera? I don't know what you're talking about. Don't... play dumb with me. I swear, I don't know what you mean. You're working for Hera! She is... actually... working for me. Phaedra, come here. Thank you. Excuse us? I don't believe this! Father, what the hell is going on?! Son, have some faith in your father, please. Try to understand! Understand?! - Understand what?! - Well, I... I never expected you... to be there to help me! But now you're actually working against me?! No, no. I am trying to help you! Help me?! Antaeus nearly... broke my neck. That... bridge almost killed the both of us. Ah, but it didn't! It just... slowed you down. What about Deianeira? You ruined everything I had with her. Yes. I'm... really... sorry about that. I was just trying to... protect you. Protect me from what?! The insane mission you're on. Son. You want to commit suicide? Father. What has Hera done with the torch? She's surrounded it in a circle of fire. Fire that kills... immortality. Well, I never wanted to live forever. Why didn't you come with me the day I asked you to? You're here now. Why not stay here now? Please. You can't be serious. You want me... to sit here..., let the world freeze to death... What is it?! Deianeira?! We can get her here. She can stay with us. Come on... You just don't get it, do you? You go through that circle, and you'll die. Open the door. This time, I'm defying you. Then I'll do it myself. The more you love them, the more they hurt you. Deianeira. Hercules. I didn't trust you. I'm sorry. You were telling the truth. Don't try to talk. Here. This will keep you warm. We're getting closer. We have to find the circle of fire. Stop! Go back. - Get out of my way. - Don't you move. I told you to go back! I'm going in there. You may be the strongest man in the world, but remember: I'm still... the king of the gods. Hercules... Stay back. Get back to the cave! Don't do this. You are pushing me, boy. The next one will not be aimed at your feet! You could really kill me, couldn't you? I am trying to save you. Why can't you understand that?! The lives of all those people? I care about people. It so happens... I care more about you. Father! I love you too. But I... still have to do this. Prometheus's torch. The fire is back! The fire! Look! Come, boys. Hercules. He's dying. Hera, Hera... Stop this savagery! You hurt my son and I'll haunt you... into eternity! You wanna hurt my son..., then you'll have to take me too. Son! Son. Are you all right?! Father... Oh, son. I thought you were dead. So did I. Can... Can you get up? I... I think so. Here. Let me help you. Hold on, hold on. It's all right, son. Let's get out of here. Easy. Here. You saved my life. That's what fathers are for. But... what if Hera hadn't backed down? We'd be in a lot of trouble. - Why don't you two go home? - No. Wait. Hercules..., do you know the power of those flames? Yes..., I do. You're feeling better now, aren't you?! You sure are, my little sweetie! What?! No one guarding this post?! Hercules! Okay, what's this? Step into the circle. - Look, Hercules... - Do it. - You know how I feel... - This is the last time. I promise. It's gone. My wound! My wound is gone! I'm mortal. You did it. No, we did it. Who is the mighty Hercules going to help next? I don't know. Do you have someone in mind?
