You've probably heard the uproar... over the new Michael Jackson video. The new Michael Jackson video is an event in itself. ...which the pop world has waited for for four years. Did you see that new Michael Jackson video? Even if you didn't like it, didn't understand it... or could really care less... you couldn't pull your eyes away from the spectacle. Fox Broadcasting says that it made a mistake... in broadcasting... the 11-minute "Black or White" video last night. The international broadcast premiere of "Black or White"... was immediately followed by uproar and condemnation. We played the short film for Elayne Blythe... president of the Film Advisory Board. And all these kids in this film and the kids watching... Look at that. Jeepers, I can't believe this. I thought it was great. I like Michael. He's the best. That part could be construed... as gratuitous violence and sex... but I don't think that was its intent. Fox Broadcasting cleared the entire video for air... and the company released a statement today saying... "In hindsight, this decision was an error." Jeffrey Jolson-Colburn... is the music editor for the "Hollywood Reporter..." And he, like a lot of people... are wondering if the whole thing isn't a publicity stunt. Jackson says he was only trying to interpret... the animalistic instincts of the panther into a dance. In a statement released within the hour... Michael Jackson said... "It upsets me to think that 'Black or White'... "...could influence any child or adult... "to destructive behavior," Jackson said... "either sexual or violent. "I deeply regret any pain or hurt the final segment of... ...'Black or White' has caused children, their parents... "or any other viewers." My guess is that it's Michael's childlike playfulness... that got him into this problem... and it is his childlike openness that solved it. Michael Jackson... He does a little bit of everything... just so different, so unique in his style. He's the greatest. I love him. The man is just tremendous. I grew up with his music, and I think he's extremely talented. He's a great singer. I love him. He's a genius. He's the dancer of our age. Boy, he sings so cool. I think he's the ultimate live performer. I love you, Michael Jackson. You're the best singer. I just love the way he dances. I wish I could do that. Michael Jackson's the King of Pop. Michael's the King of Pop. Undoubtedly the King of Pop. Turn that noise off! I thought I told you to turn that thing off! It is too late, and it's too loud! But, Dad, this is the best part. You are wasting your time with this garbage. Now, go to bed! OK. He's been batting at a .600 average all season. Johnson checks the runners... gets the signal, and the pitch! The throw! He's safe! Well, how's that? Runners are on first... Eat this. I'm afraid your father's going to be very upset... when he gets back. ♪ I took my baby ♪ ♪ on a Saturday bang ♪ ♪ Boy, is that girl with you? ♪ ♪ Yes, we're one and the same ♪ ♪ Now, I believe in miracles ♪ ♪ And a miracle ♪ ♪ has happened tonight ♪ ♪ But if you're thinkin' ♪ ♪ about my baby ♪ ♪ It don't matter ♪ ♪ if you're black or white ♪ ♪ They print my message ♪ ♪ in the "Saturday Sun" ♪ ♪ I had to tell 'em ♪ ♪ I ain't second to none ♪ ♪ And I told about equality ♪ ♪ And it's true, either ♪ ♪ you're wrong, or you're right ♪ ♪ But if you're thinkin' ♪ ♪ about my baby ♪ ♪ It don't matter ♪ ♪ if you're black or white ♪ ♪ Don't matter ♪ ♪ I am tired of this devil ♪ ♪ I am tired of this stuff ♪ ♪ I am tired of this business ♪ ♪ So when the goin' gets rough ♪ ♪ I ain't scared of your brother ♪ ♪ I ain't scared of no sheets ♪ ♪ I ain't scared of nobody ♪ ♪ Girl, when the goin' gets mean ♪ ♪ Protection for gangs, ♪ ♪ clubs, and nations ♪ ♪ Causin' grief in human relations ♪ ♪ It's a turf war ♪ ♪ on a global scale ♪ ♪ I'd rather hear ♪ ♪ both sides of the tale ♪ ♪ See, it's not about races, ♪ ♪ just places, faces ♪ ♪ Where your blood comes from ♪ ♪ is where your space is ♪ ♪ I've seen the bright get duller ♪ ♪ I'm not gonna spend my life ♪ ♪ bein' a color ♪ ♪ Don't tell me you agree with me ♪ ♪ When I saw you ♪ ♪ kickin' dirt in my eye ♪ ♪ But if you're thinkin' ♪ ♪ about my baby ♪ ♪ It don't matter ♪ ♪ if you're black or white ♪ ♪ I said if you're thinkin' ♪ ♪ of bein' my baby ♪ ♪ It don't matter ♪ ♪ if you're black or white ♪ ♪ I said if you're thinkin' ♪ ♪ of bein' my brother ♪ ♪ It don't matter ♪ ♪ if you're black or white ♪ ♪ All right ♪ ♪ It's black, it's white ♪ ♪ It's tough for you to be ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ It's black, it's white ♪ ♪ It's black, it's white ♪ ♪ It's tough for you to be ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ It's black ♪ ♪ All right ♪ ♪ It's black, it's white ♪ ♪ It's tough for you to be ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ It's black, it's white ♪ ♪ It's black, it's white ♪ ♪ It's tough for you to be ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ It's black ♪ ♪ All right ♪ ♪ It's black, it's white ♪ ♪ It's tough for you to be ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ It's black, it's white ♪ ♪ It's black, it's white ♪ ♪ It's tough for you to be ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ It's black, it's white ♪ Cut! That was perfect. How do you do that? Bart, turn off that noise! Chill out, homeboy. Ready all around, watch the cues, and... playback. Cut! I feel like Buffalo Bill. Vince Patterson, our choreographer... had the excellent idea... of having Michael do some of the ethnic dancing... and then interpret it his own way. Cut! I like it best when Michael does what they do because people... aren't used to seeing Michael as just a pure dancer. He's incredibly versatile and can do that stuff. Cut! Cut! OK, everybody. We're ready. Action! If you're thinkin' about my baby It don't matter if you're black or white It's got to go faster than that. Our cue for the move is when one of the children pick it up. Once we're about this size, then you can pick up speed... but I really want a good chance to see the children's faces. We're rolling. Even if the kids are crying, I'm getting a shot now. Michael, it's really a scene here. We have three screaming babies... and now we're going to try to get our second set of babies. We're having such a hard time. The idea of Michael punching through smoke... that was a very traditional blue screen. That's the way they've been doing composite shots... for many, many years. Michael was on a treadmill in front of a blue screen... and we photograph the actor... and then the other elements are put in later. Girl, when the goin' gets mean Don't tell me you agree with me When I saw you kickin' dirt in my eye Michael's going to do what he did. You're going to start on the sky over there... and just sweep by him this way. I'm going to let you do one more "Thinkin' about my baby..." Because if the painting is beautiful... I want to stay on it longer. It don't matter if you're black or white The technique we're using here has become known as morphing... and that's short for transformation... or metamorphosing. We'll select the eyes and the mouth and the nose... and then we let the computer run the transformation. It can take four or five hours just to run the frames... for a second of transformation. It's black, it's white It's tough for you to be Yeah, yeah, yeah Look at this. Is James Brown here? Look out! I think the pranks basically came about... through Michael's relationship with Macaulay Culkin. These are... stink bombs. Macaulay would say to Michael... "That guy's always giving you a hard time... "and we got to get him." Does it stink out there? Just slowly pull it straight up. Higher, please. Higher. OK. OK. It's a wrap! Thank you! Nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk. Nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk. I knew that Mac and Mike were up to something. All right. Get the fan. Papers and leaves. I was very taken aback by how elaborate it was. And he's going to hit John with the first pie. I go, "John." It's white, whoo! Where's Mac? This looks very dangerous to me. In appreciation for working on... the "Black or White" short film... we'd like to say thank you and we love you... and we think you've done a wonderful job. - John. - What, Mac? - John. - Yes? Before he won 12 Grammy awards... before he dazzled billions of fans around the world... with his amazing talent as a performer... before he impacted on millions of lives... with his ongoing humanitarian efforts... before all of that, he was one other thing. He was my brother. Hi. I'm Janet Jackson, and I'm pleased to be here tonight... to honor the man I love and admire... as an artist and a person... My brother Michael Jackson. The Grammy Legend Award is given for ongoing contributions... and influence in the recording field... but nowhere does it tell you what to do to become a legend. If I were to write a book of instructions... using my brother as a guide... it would read something like this. "How to Become a Legend." Let's start with the present and work our way backwards.

Congratulations, Michael Jackson. No, but I just wanted to say one thing seriously. Michael! I just wanted to tell you how proud I am of you... and how much you've inspired me... and how proud I am to be your sister... and how much I love you. I do. Well... I love you, too. Thank you. I hope this puts to rest... I hope this finally put to rest another rumor... that has been in the press for too many years. Me and Janet really are two different people. In the past month, I've gone from "Where is he?" To "Here he is again." But I must confess, it feels good... to be thought of as a person, not as a personality, because... I don't read all the things written about me. I wasn't aware that the world... thought I was so weird and bizarre... but when you grow up as I did... in front of 100 million people since the age of five... you're automatically different. The last few weeks, I have been cleansing myself... and it's been a rebirth for myself. It's like a cleansing spirit. I love you, Michael! I love you, too. My childhood was completely taken away from me. There was no Christmas. There was no birthdays. It was not a normal childhood. No normal pleasures of childhood. Those were exchanged for hard work, struggle, and pain... and eventual material and professional success. But as an awful price... I cannot re-create that part of my life... nor would I change any part of my life. However, today when I create my music... I feel like an instrument of nature. I wonder what delight nature must feel... when we open our hearts and express our God-given talents. The sound of approval rose across the universe... and the whole world abounds in magic. Wonder fills our hearts, for we have glimpsed, for an instant... the playfulness of life... and that's why I love children... and learn so much from being around them. I realize that many of our world's problems today... from the inner-city crime to large-scale wars... and terrorism and our overcrowded prisons... are a result of the fact that children... have had their childhood stolen from them. The magic, the wonder, the mystery... and the innocence of a child's heart... are the seeds of creativity that will heal the world. I really believe that. What we.. what we... We love you! I love you, too. What we need to learn... What we need to learn from children isn't childish. Being with them connects us to the deeper wisdom of life... which is ever-present and only asks to be lived. They know the way to solutions that lie... waiting to be recognized within our own hearts. Today I would like to thank all the children of the world... including the sick and deprived. I am so sensitive to your pain. I also... I also want to thank all those who have helped me... to channel my talent here on Earth. From the beginning, my parents, all my brothers and sisters... especially Janet. I am so proud of her. It's incredible. I mean, I remember when we were little... I used to ask her to be Ginger Rogers... while I was Fred Astaire. The Motown family... My teacher Berry Gordy... Diana Ross-4 love you; Suzanne de Passe the wonderful, great Quincy Jones... Teddy Riley; My new godson Michael Gibb... my new Sony family... Akio Morita... Mickey Schulhof, Tommy Mottola... Dave Glew, Polly Anthony. Thanks for making one of my most creative efforts... The album "Dangerous"... Such an incredible success. I love you all so much.

Jam It ain't -It ain't too much stuff -Jam I'm out here trying to follow this man's lead. It was totally ludicrous... and I felt stupid... but I guess that's the way they wanted it to look. Cut!

OK, what you do is stand, boom. One, two, three... and pow. Bend your toes in and out. I'm gonna pull a muscle, here. OK, let me see. I don't know, Michael. Good, that's good. Dangerous, man. Now you stand like this. Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow. Pow, pow. Put all your energy into your finger. Boom, just throw it out like fire. Yeah, OK, like, boom? Pow! No, like this. - Like that? - Move this finger here. Oh, just the one? OK. Yeah, but feel all the energy coming through you... like a rocket. Coming out of you like, pow! Your feet are... can't hold it. Wham, just throw it out. All right, just, ah, ooh! Oh, what's this? It's almost like walking... the same system, but you're going back, OK? Back? With the same timing. OK. Yeah, because you're taking your weight... and you're pushing it back. That's what creates the illusion is the weight shifting. Now, as this foot comes back, the other one goes up. I think I got it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, all right, all right. Follow me. Yeah, yeah. It ain't too hard for me to... what's the last? Hard for me to jam. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, you got it. Yeah, yeah, I got it. Ain't too hard for me to jam. It ain't too hard for me to jam... Do this one. Yeah, it ain't too hard for me to jam. It ain't too hard for me to jam. You got it. Yeah, I think... It ain't too hard for me to jam. Yeah. It ain't too hard for me to jam. You got it. Wait. What's so funny? You ready to play some basketball? Children show me in their playful smiles... the divine in everyone. These children are a reminder of the preciousness of all life... especially young lives untouched by hatred, prejudice, and greed. Now when the world is so confused... and its problems so complicated... we need our children more than ever. The mission of Heal the World, my mission, is healing... pure and simple. To heal the world, we must start by healing our children. Being with them connects us to the deep wisdom of life. This simple goodness shines straight from their hearts. We have to heal our wounded planet. I wrote this song for everyone in our world... in an effort to help bring global harmony. Think about the generations... and they say we want to make it a better place... for our children and our children's children... so that they know it's a better world for them... and think if they can make it a better place. There's a place in your heart And I know that it is love And this place can be much brighter than tomorrow And if you really try You'll find there's no need to cry In this place, we'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow There are ways to get there If you care enough for the living Make a little space Make a better place Heal the world Make it a better place For you and for me and the entire human race There are people dying If you care enough for the living Make a better place for you and for me If you want to know why there's a love that cannot lie Love is strong It only cares for joyful giving If we try We shall see in this bliss we cannot feel fear or dread We stop existing and start living Then it feels that always love's enough for us growing Make a better world Heal the world Make it a better place For you and for me and the entire human race There are people dying If you care enough for the living Make a better place For you and for me And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace Then why do we keep strangling life Wound this earth, crucify its soul? Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly Be God's glow We could fly so high Let our spirits never die In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers Create a world with no fear Together we'll cry happy tears So the nations turn their swords into plowshares We could really get there If you cared enough for the living Make a little space To make a better place Heal the world Make it a better place For you and for me and the entire human race There are people dying If you care enough for the living Make a better place For you and for me Heal the world Make it a better place For you and for me and the entire human race There are people dying If you care enough for the living Make a better place For you and for me Heal the world Heal the world Make it a better place For you and for me and the entire human race There are people dying If you care enough for the living Make a better place For you and for me There are people dying If you care enough for the living Make a better place for you and for me Everywhere There are people dying If you care enough for the living Make a better place For you and for me You and for me Make a better place You and for me Make a better place You and for me Make a better place You and for me Heal the world we live in You and for me Save it for our children You and for me Heal the world we live in You and for me Save it for our children You and for me Heal the world we live in You and for me Save it for our children You and for me Heal the world we live in -You and for me -Save it for our children She always takes it With a heart of stone 'Cause all she does is throws it back to me I've spent a lifetime looking for someone Don't try to understand me Just simply do the things I say Love is a feeling Give it when I want it 'Cause I'm on fire Quench my desire Give it when I want it Talk to me, woman Give in to me You always knew just how to make me cry And never did I ask you questions why It seems you get your kicks from hurting me Don't try to understand me Because your words just aren't enough Love is a feeling Quench my desire Give it when I want it Takin' me higher Love is a woman I don't want to hear it Give in to me You and your friends were laughing at me in town But it's OK And it's OK You won't be laughin', girl...

And it doesn't seem to matter And it doesn't seem right 'Cause the will has brought no fortune Still I cry alone at night Don't you judge of my composure 'Cause I'm lyin' to myself And the reason why she left me Did she find in someone else? Who is it? Is it a friend of mine? Who is it? Is it my brother? Who is it? Somebody hurt my soul, now Who is it? I can't take this stuff no more I am the damned I am the dead I am the agony Inside the dying head This is injustice Woe unto thee I pray this punishment would have mercy on me And she promised me forever That we'd live our life as one We made our vows we'd live a love so true It seems that she has left me for such reasons unexplained I need to find the truth But, see, what will I do? And it doesn't seem to matter And it doesn't seem right 'Cause the will has brought no fortune Still I cry alone at night Don't you judge of my composure 'Cause I'm bothered every day And she didn't leave a letter She just up and ran away Who is it? Is it a friend of mine? Who is it? Is it my brother? Who is it? Somebody hurt my soul, now Who is it?

It took two 747 jets... to transport the set and equipment across the Atlantic... and a crew of 235 people just to put it all together... over here. A little over a hundred automated lights... that follow him or, you know, create patterns... or light certain areas of the stage. Close to 2,000 lights altogether.
