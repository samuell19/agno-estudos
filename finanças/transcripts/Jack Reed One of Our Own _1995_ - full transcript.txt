Baby, what's up? - What? You want none of this? What's going on? ♫ I can't make time, please bring on all the bang (gunshot) (people scream) (tires squealing) (heavy crash) (gunshot) - What's up? (gunshot) ♫ Buried alive ♫ Yes, I did it, G ♫ Gotta trash to entertain (tires squealing) (phones ringing) - Your old man, he just kicks the door in. There's the three of them standin there, they got guns in their hands, right? He just yells at 'em, "Drop the guns, now!" And they do, all three of them, they drop the guns. One guy starts crying, for god's sake (chuckles). I tell you, your old man's something else. - Yeah, Jack, you know, I've heard this a couple times before. - Well, there gotta gotta be 1,000,0000 Jimmy Quinn stories. Toughest cop I ever knew, one of the best too. - We got a drive-by shooting out at the lake, you guys wanna take it? - Anybody hurt? - I don't know, it just came over the net. What's that, fat boy? (Mike laughs) - You can have a piece, boss, a small one. - Not me, I'm on a diet, unlike others around here. - I'm on a diet. The Oreo diet. (upbeat rap music) - Time to get paid, baby, let's go. ♫ You know what I'm sayin' ♫ Ha ha ♫ Brought in a rage, you know what I'm sayin' (gunshot) (glass shatters) - Bob, you crazy, man. (orchestral music) (crowd chatter) - Well, how bad? - Well, it's nothing, just a few cuts from all the glass flying around. - Amazing. Hope she bought herself a lottery ticket this month. - [Mike] Think you could pick him out of a lineup? - I don't know. He had glasses, one of those shiny kind and a hat too. (sobbing) Why does this have to happen to me now? I mean, it doesn't make any sense. - It's not supposed to make sense. It's where we're at these days. Detective Quinn is gonna follow you to the hospital. There somebody I could call? - I'm sorry, I don't feel very good right now. - It's okay, Sarah, you're doing fine. You're doing great, everything's gonna be okay. Can I call you Sarah? - [Nurse] One of you guys Reed? - Yeah, that's me. - A Lieutenant Silvera's trying to get you on the net. - Now what? That's gotta be the same guys. Black man, a shotgun, he's wearing those sunglasses. Maybe the shooting at the beach was some kind of a diversion. - For what? For $800 from a convenience store? Come on, it's a couple of crackheads. They don't even know why they do what they do, but they're doing it with a semi-automatic shotgun. We gotta close them down fast. Let's look at it again. - Okay. (doorbell rings) - Hi, Becky. I'm sorry, I forgot my keys in the car. - No, no, no, no, it's okay, sweetie. You poor thing, you all right? - Yeah. - God, it's so awful. - I'm sorry, Becky Bennett, this is Detective Mike Quinn. Michael, I'm sorry. - Take a hot bath, go to bed, and you stop apologizing. (Sarah chuckles) Here's my card. It's got all my numbers on it. If you remember anything else, why don't you give me a call? - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah, thanks Michael, you've been really great. - It's my pleasure. - Thank you. - It's nice meeting you. - Thanks a lot. - Bye. - Oh. - Oh my god, look at you. - I know. - Oh, honey. (phone rings) - Hello? Yeah, Nicole, pick up. - [Nicole] Who is it? - Who's calling please? - Arlene, this T-shirt has shrunk. You've been drying my clothes on high again, right? - Hold on, no Jack, you're getting fatter. Nicole, it's Dick Clark. - Well, don't beat around the bush, Arlene. You know, just say whatever comes to your mind. - Dad, we have gotta go. - Dick, Dick, Rick, Slick, I'm sorry. She's in the shower. She'll call you back as soon as she gets out, okay? - Mother, why did you say that? I'm not calling him back. - Mom, will you help me with this please? - I'll help you here. - God. - Turn around here. - No, Dad. You always screw it up. Mom. - That's it. Enough. You two, go to your shooting match. You call Rick or Dick or whatever his name back and you tell him, well, you lie to him. I'm not doing it for you anymore. - Arlene, come on. - That's it. Now, go. And don't come back for at least two hours. - [Jack] All right, all right. Come on, let's get out of here, John. - And don't stop for ice cream. And buckle your seat belts. - Well, she's pretty upset, Phil. She probably won't be in the office tomorrow. I'll get her to call you. Thanks, Phil. (slow piano music) You creep. Sarah, Phil Brenner just called. - Oh god. - [Becky] I told him you'd call him at the office tomorrow. - I wish he would just leave me alone. Leave me alone. - All right, remember, breathe out, aim, and squeeze. - Look, Dad, I love you, okay? - Good. - [John] And I respect you and all that. - Well, I'm glad to hear it. - But now I gotta start doing some stuff on my own. - I'm just trying to help you, John. - I know you're a good shot, Dad. I'm a good shot too and I'd like to prove that by myself. Okay, Dad? - You're pretty smart too. Smarter than me. Okay. Then prove it. Let me get my cellphone. I'll leave it here, okay? (peaceful piano music) (upbeat rock music) (Bobby cocks gun) (slow piano music) - Becky. (gunshots) (crowd chatter) (slow piano music) Becky? (dog barking) - I don't know if this (Sarah gasps) blood's gonna come off. Oh honey, did I scare you? - Oh, this is crazy. - Come on, we're just being silly. (laughs) (doorbell rings) (Becky screams) (both laugh) You get into bed, I'll get it. - No wait, I'll get it. Will you throw that in the dryer for me too please? Thanks. (Becky laughs) Get it. - Sarah. (suspenseful music) Anybody home? (knocking) - Becky, Becky, it's him. It's him, get down, get down. It's him, the guy who tried to kill me today. - What? - [Bobby's Friend] Well, maybe there's nobody home, man. - [Bobby] Nah, I heard something near me, come on. - [Becky] Get in the basement, get in the basement. Go. (dial tone) No, he's not a prowler, he's trying to kill us. Hurry please. - [Dispatcher] All units, 611 North Cleveland. Home invasion in progress. - Dispatch, this is 480. What was that address again? (tires squealing) Come on, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, come on. (phone ringing) Shoot. Dispatch, this is Quinn again. I can't reach Sergeant Reed on his cellphone. Do me a favor, track him down. Tell him what's going on, thanks. (tires squealing) (slow piano music) (phone rings) Hey, Jack. - He's here, Mike. The guy with the shotgun. He's here. (glass breaking) (screams) He's inside, oh god. - Sarah, you just hold on. I'm two blocks away, okay? Hold on. (siren) (slow piano music) (siren) Dispatch, this is Quinn. I'm pulling into 611 North Cleveland. (bell ringing) - [Instructor] Ready on the firing line. Watch your target. (slow piano music) - All right, you. You in the bushes, you come out into the light slowly. Nice and slow. - What's the problem, Officer? - Stop right there. You alone? - Yes sir, I knocked on the door, but nobody seemed to answer. - Is that your black van back there? - No sir, I don't own a car. - You got any ID on you? - Yes, sir. - Easy, easy. Nice and easy. No fast moves. I want you to take that, put that on the grass. Take a step back, lay down on your belly, you understand that? - Yes, sir. - You understand that? (gunshot) (crowd chatter) (gunshots) (bell rings) - [Instructor] All right, shooters. Rapid fire, 10 rounds. 60 seconds, lock and load. (tires squealing) (police siren) - Michael Williams. Is that you? - Hey, cop. (gunshots) (bell rings) - Cease fire, shooters. Cease fire. (crowd chatter) All shooters, clear your weapons. All shooters, clear your weapons. (slow music) - Where the hell were you, Jack? You were his partner, you should've been there. - James, that's enough. Go to the car now and wait for me. Take him out, Father. Sorry, Jack. He didn't mean it. His heart is broken, poor man. - [Jack] I'm really sorry about this. - I know you are. Come to the church please. He'll be fine. God bless you, Jack. - Don't make 'em like that anymore. - What the hell happened? - Give me a minute. Okay, fellas, thanks for coming in. I appreciate it and the Quinns appreciate it too. Sergeant Dirkson from the city will fill you in. We'll have more after the autopsy. - Okay, listen up. We're looking for a black Chevy van. '85 or an '86. Dark tinted windows, boombox rig. License unknown. These guys are cop killers. - How long did you work with Mike for? - Three or four months. He was studying homicide investigation, but I've known him since he was a kid. His father was a cop. He used to be a good friend of mine. - It's so awful. - Somebody's trying to hurt you, Miss Landry. - No. I don't believe that, it's not possible. - Hey. - Hi. - [Jack] Come on in. Arlene Reed, this is Sarah Landry. - Hi. - Hi. I heard about Mike, are you all right? - I've been better. I'm gonna drop Sarah off at Patty Boyle's motel just till we pick up the shooters. - Patty Boyle's, that rat hole? Patty's an ex-cop and a sweet guy, but he's also a drunk and the worst housekeeper. - Arlene, it's 2:30 in the morning. My day is just beginning. We just stopped by because I wanna make sure John Jr.'s okay. - You'd better go up and talk to him. - He's still awake? - The Erickson's brought him home. He heard about Mike on the late news. He's pretty upset. - All right, just give me a few minutes, all right? - Jack. He shot the highest score in the troop tonight. - [Jack] Hey. - Hi, Dad. I heard your car. - How you doing, sport? - It's all my fault, Dad. If you were with Mike tonight, he'd be okay. - Listen to me, John and listen very carefully. Mike Quinn is dead because two bad guys killed him, okay? It wasn't society. It wasn't circumstance. It wasn't me and it wasn't you. Mike Quinn was a decent hardworking man and he was killed because he was trying to help somebody by two evil rotten worthless bastards and it's nobody's fault but theirs. Okay? - Don't get killed, Dad. - I can't get killed. Too old. It's against regulation. Hey, I heard you did real good with the shooting tonight, huh? - Never gonna shoot again. - Jack, I'm gonna put Sarah in the spare room. She can stay here until you catch those guys. Least this way she'll have clean sheets and towels. Come on, Sarah. (Jack chuckles) - All right, kid. Get some sleep. - He was shot three times. They were all fatal shots. Quinn must have been holding the license close to his chest. The first slug went right through it and carried a fragment along with it. Next slide please? Now we recovered it. - ARQ? Marquette?

(Charles coughs) - [Officer] It looks like three. - [Officer] Come on, man, move him. (men laugh) - Good, Lieutenant. - All right. - Hey man, why don't you loosen up the cuffs a little? - Oh, come on, kid. Watch your head. - Hey, that's police brutality, man. Can I get a witness here? - No, no, no, you don't get that here. You get that downtown. (truck engine rattles) What are you doing? Come on, let's go. Get that out of here. (man in truck laughs) (upbeat action music) - [Officer] Let's go. - [Michael] Come on, loosen them up, man. - What happened to his head? You know, brutality is a tool of the dull-witted. - Very impressive, Reed. What great thinker said that? - Me, just now. - [Eddie] Any luck, Lieutenant? - I think he's as slippery as a greased eel. This one say anything? - Yeah, he wants his lawyer. - How you feeling? - I want a couple rounds of Mike Tyson (chuckles). But let's get him out of here. If anyone so much as touches him, I'll have their ass, understood? - Wait, but before we do anything, let me just have a minute with him. Give me your handcuff keys. All right. - Ah. - Just go like that. Okay. So tell me, Michael, you smoke? - Look, it's Mick. I hate Michael and yes, I do smoke. - All right. Sergeant 13, get us some cigarettes, would you please? Look at these guys. Your partner's some piece of work. - You ain't never gonna get Bobby alive. - Yeah, you're probably right. Bobby Jones is as tough as they come. (Michael laughs) - Who? - Bobby Jones. Your partner. That's his name. Yeah, we made him off the surveillance tape at that convenience store he shot up yesterday. Oh, we go way back with Bobby Jones. (chuckles) What name did he use with you, Mick? - Well, he told me his name was Bobby Dixon. - Dixon, Dixon. Yeah, he used that once in a while. All right, listen, I'm gonna see about those smokes and we'll get out of here, okay? So don't go away. Hey, black kid's name is Bobby Dixon. - I'll get us started. Look, from now on, nobody talks to him but me, understand? Nobody. - Listen, now we're gonna take the scenic route up to Ravenstone, maybe Winnetka. Find ourselves a burger joint, we'll have some lunch and no talking upfront. Maybe you'll learn something. Nah. How 'bout some ketchup, huh? - [Mick] Ketchup's good. - I always get the stuff all over me when it's good like this. - Hey, what about my lawyer, man? - Yeah, we'll make some calls, but you know once you get behind the lawyer, I'm not gonna be able to help you anymore. (Mick laughs) - Oh, is that what you're doing, you're helping me? - Actually, I am trying to help you. Why don't you tell me your side of it? Look, you killed a cop. You realize what you're facing here? - I didn't kill him. - You were there. You were there, Mick, during the commission of a felony. You were hired to murder Sarah Landry. We knew all about that. Under the felony murder rule, you're just as guilty as if you pulled a trigger, but we got you, you're in custody. Who do you think we're gonna make a case against, huh? Now you help us out, we'll help you back. Otherwise, you're gonna take the fall all by yourself and it's gonna be a real hard one too. Are you finished with that? You want a cigarette? You guys don't mind if he smokes, do you? Go 'head, have a cigarette. (crowd chatter) - All right, keep it down here. How many times do I have to tell you to keep it down? - Where is he, Jack? Where is he, Jack? What happened to the other one? Come on, Jack. - We haven't even processed him yet, all right? Give us a few minutes. - Sergeant Reed. Sergeant Reed. - Yeah? - If Mr. Williams has been hurt or threatened by you or anyone. - Excuse me. I'm Jack Reed, you are? - I'm Anne Keifer, I'm Mr. Williams' attorney and I've been waiting here for 45 minutes. - Well, that's pretty interesting. He's only been in custody for an hour or so. Who hired you? - That is not the point and it's none of your business. Where's my client? I wanna speak to him immediately. I don't want you talking to any police officers, Michael. Especially this one, Sergeant Reed. - Mick. - What? - He likes to be called Mick. Look, counselor, you can talk to your client just as soon as he's been processed. Find out who she's working for. - What did you say? - She's a lawyer, she works for whoever pays her. Are you paying her, Mick? Come on, let's go. You can talk to him in 10 minutes, counselor. (women laughing) - So pretty. - Nicole, it looks great. - [John] Holy cow, Nicole. - Yes, John? It's me, what do you think? - Wow. Think you'd better shave your legs. - Mom, won't you do something with him please? - Darling, pack your bags and get out. You look wonderful, angel. You look so, so beautiful and so grown up. I love you, honey. - [Nicole] I love you too, Mom. - Kids. - You have a great family. - Yeah. - When I was a kid, it was just my mom and me. When I was two, my dad just, he just took off. You know, when I was in school, I used to make up these stories about my dad (chuckles), that he was a soldier of fortune and that he fought oil fires all over the world. I think the only person who actually believed those stories was me (chuckles). (phone rings) - I'm sorry. Hello? - Hey. Did you see me on TV? - No, no, we were having a fashion show. Were you on TV? What was it, a pie eating contest? (Jack laughs) - A fat joke after a 14 hour day. Thank you very much, dear. Listen, tell Sarah we got one of her boys and he's my new best friend. - They caught one of the guys. Jack thinks he's gonna talk. - Jack, he wants to see you now. - Ooh, that was fast. I gotta go, I'll call you later. Tell Sarah to stay in the house. - Jack says stay in the house. - You're really lucky to have him. (slow music) - Yes, I am. - Nicole's lucky too to have a father like that. Sometimes I think that because of my dad, the men that I get involved with, it's always like the same guy, you know? I mean, they're strong and ambitious, but they can be selfish and dangerous. - Sarah, you deserve better than that. - Do I? (Mick sobs) - It's all right. It's all right, it's all right, what's the matter? What's the matter? Tell me, man, what's wrong? (Mick sobs) You're scared. Talk to me. - I'm scared of him. - You believe this? - You gotta hang in there. Come on now, we can work through this thing together, but you gotta be smart. You gotta be smart. - It's Father Flanagan. - Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, have a cigarette. Drink some of your pop. - [Eddie] Reed'll do anything to get a confession. - Except perform an unnatural act, he says. - Maybe that's next. - My lawyer says I'm not even supposed to talk to you. - Well, she's doing what she's supposed to do. The question is who is she doing it for? - Hey, that's what I figure. Who's paying her, you know? - Yeah. - Well, it was a friend, she said. - Hey, it's nice to have friends. My back is killing me. I'm gonna stretch out, okay? - [Eddie] What the hell's he doing now? - He's getting below his eye level. - Why? - Shut up, I wanna hear this. - Oh, during this time of day, I can hardly stand up straight. - What happened? - A wrestling match with a drunk. He gets 30 days in the tank. I get a bad back for the rest of my life. - We didn't mean to kill the cop. What I mean is it was an accident. - Sure you wanna talk about this without your lawyer here, Mick? - With her or without her. - Well, accidents can happen with guns. Course it's unusual for an accident victim to be shot three times. - No, I mean he wasn't supposed to be there. - [Jack] Oh, I see. - Yeah, he surprised us is what I mean. - You mean while you were trying to kill Sarah Landry? - Yeah. - Listen, Mick, there's a waiver on the table there. Do me a favor, take that pen and sign it, will you? Right next to the red dot? How much did he pay you? - $3,000 to get to Las Vegas. Bobby, he'll know more I guess. - Cash? - Yeah, he gave me half already. - So he's got money. Maybe he's paying for your lawyer. - Yep, that's what I figure. It's like, you know, if I keep my mouth shut up. You know, yeah, for him? Yeah right. - Who's him? - Fox. We're The Fox. I don't know his real name, but-- - But what? - Well, I mean, she must know who did it. - Sarah Landry? - [Mick] Yeah. - [Jack] Why do you say that? (slow music) - Because she's his girlfriend. - [Charles] His lawyer's on the way and she ain't happy. - [Jack] It's a legitimate statement. You can take it to the bank. - He could repudiate it. - So what, it's still evidence. - That's right, they'll have to deal with it in court. - So what about the other kid, the shooter? - He's surfaced at a landfill project over at Calumet. Commandeered a garbage truck, stole the driver's money and clothes, and left the truck over on the West Side and get this. The driver says he's got a broken leg. - He's scary, this guy. - Yeah, hey Jack, look. Talk to the girl, ask her about the boyfriend. Tell her just to lay low for a while longer. I'll take care of Bobby Dixon. He's mine. - Oh, you can have him. - You can have him. (Jack chuckles) - No, that's impossible. - Sarah, somebody actually paid these bozos to try to kill you and bozo one says it was one of your old boyfriends. - No, I don't believe it. It's a lie. - Tell me about Phil Brenner. - What? - [Arlene] Good morning. - Morning. - I was just, I forgot something upstairs. - I talked to Becky last night and I talked to a couple of girls from your office. Maria Rez, Marian James. They say you used to go out with this guy, Phil Brenner. You actually lived with him for a while and you broke up. Ever since then, you've been scared to death of him. - Jack, I don't wanna talk about this anymore. Nobody is trying to kill me and that includes Phil Brenner. - Maybe I should talk to Phil Brenner. - Jack, don't do that. Please don't do that, Jack. - Why not? Come on, Sarah, talk to me. Why not? - I don't wanna talk about this anymore, okay? - Come on, Phil, baby. Pump it, seven more. (Phil grunting) Six more. Five more. Four more. Three more. Two more. - [Secretary] Mr. Brenner, I'm sorry to bother you. There's a policeman of Sergeant Reed here to see you. - He have an appointment? - [Secretary] No, sir. - Well, I'm busy. Tell him to come back. Thursday'd be good. - [Secretary] He says he needs to talk to you about the two killers you hired to shoot Sarah Landry. - What is this, some kind of joke? - [Jack] Mr. Brenner. - [Phil] Reed. I know you, you're Jack Reed. - Hey, I know you too. You work for Pete Myers. - Hey, I don't work for Pete Myers. I work for the county. Now what the hell are you doing busting in here? - Mick Williams says you hired him and another bozo to kill Sarah Landry. - Hey, that is crap. I never hired anybody to do anything. Now wait a minute. You got a warrant, Reed? - Nah, I just thought I'd ask. So you deny it, Phil? - Deny it? I don't have to deny anything. This is ridiculous. - So there'd be no reason then for you to telephone Williams or Bobby Dixon, the other bozo or an attorney named Anne Keifer? - Absolutely not, I don't know these people and I'm telling you, Reed, you'd better get the hell out. - Hey, we've got no problem then. We'll just check your phone records. We'll clear this whole thing up. - You go right ahead and you check. - Good. I will. Thanks again, Mr. Brenner. - Give me Pete Myers. - [Manny] Who is that guy? - [Phil] Get the hell out of here, Manny. (dial tone) (phone ringing) This is Phil, I'm not here right now. Leave a message. (phone beeps) - Phil, it's Sarah. (soft suspenseful music) I had to call Phil. I swear, I haven't said anything to anybody. I've told you 1,000 times. I don't understand any of that stuff anyway and even if I did, I would never tell anybody. I promise. Please leave me alone, Phil. Please. (phone ringing) (phone beeps) - [Bobby] Hey man, you there? Come on, man, pick up the damn phone. Hey look, I know you're there, listen. I'm hurt and I need some help fast. Hey man, pick up the phone. They get me, it's your ass too. (loud thuds) - Please leave me alone. Please leave me alone, leave me alone, Phil. (upbeat rap music) (voices chattering) - [Officer] Look at 'em go. - [Charles] Yeah, lookouts. - Yeah, they think it's a sweep. Well, we put them out of business for a little while anyway. Let me do the talking. - [Charles] Yeah, it's your neighborhood. (voices chattering) - Relax, relax, he's not gonna be here. Mrs. Harris, it's me, Harvey Matson. (cheerful children's music) - [Mrs. Harris] If you don't mind being in here, I just wanted to keep an eye on the children. - This is Lieutenant Silvera, Mrs. Harris. You don't mind us talking with you for a minute? - Yes, this is a daycare center, Lieutenant. And I'm not licensed. - We're not here to talk about that, Mrs. Harris. It's about Bobby. He's in bad trouble this time and he's hurt. He hasn't been to a hospital or a clinic and if he doesn't get some help soon, he's gonna die. Or if some cop doesn't shoot him down first. (little girl laughs) - Hey, sweetheart (chuckles). What do you want, huh? What does she want? - She just wants to be held. (Charles laughs) - Lieutenant Silvera wants Bobby to come in on his own. Now he'll get medical treatment and a fair trial. Otherwise he's gonna get himself killed. Maybe somebody else and what's the point? But you know how to reach me. Lieutenant Silvera will leave his card for you. - You have children, Lieutenant? - Yes, ma'am, I have two. - They're the most important thing, Lieutenant. The most important thing. - Yes, ma'am, I agree with you. (bell ringing) Oh well, that was a waste of time. - [Harvey] I don't know, she can help us if she wants to. - Yeah, well who is she anyway? She can't be Bobby's mother? - Looks like we're gonna have to walk down. Looks like they jammed the elevator in your honor, Lieutenant. Bobby's mother died from an overdose when he was 11. Mrs. Harris is his grandmother. (siren) (phones ringing) (voices chattering) - [Jack] Hey, Sarge, excuse me. Do you handle inquiries for the Sheriff's department? - Yeah, all police agencies. What do you need? - There's a guy named Philip Brenner. He works for the county treasurer. I need his office phone records. He's probably got a county cell phone too. - You guys oughta get your act together. The Brenner stuff's already been picked up. - Picked up by who? - Somebody from the DA's office couple hours ago. - Well, I need my own copies. Could you break out the originals for me please? - Sorry, Sarge, they took the originals. - Wait a minute, what? The originals are never supposed to leave this office. - Tell it to the DA. Wants the originals, he got 'em. - Let me ask you something. Did this request come from the DA himself or was it made by somebody else down there? - Let me look in the log. No, it wasn't the DA. Someone else from down there, but with authorization. - Yeah, yeah, sure, with authorization. Who, what's the name? - Myers, Pete Myers. - [Manny] All right, Phil, come on now. Big pump, you can do it, come on now. (upbeat rock music) Come on, one. (Phil grunting) Two, come on, Phil. Three. Four. Come on, pump it. - What are you doing here, Reed? Not here to work out, that's pretty obvious. - You're not too bright, are you, Brenner? You get your pal, Pete Myers, to pull your phone records. That just tells me what I wanna know. - You don't know what you're talking about. - You were stupid about Sarah Landry too and not just because you hired those two mouth-breathers to kill her. She wasn't gonna hurt you, Brenner. She's scared to death of you. - You get the hell out of here. - But now your problem is me. You're a cop killer, Brenner. You don't scare me at all. - What about your family? - What did you say? - You heard what I said. You think I'm gonna roll over for you 'cause you carry a badge, huh? Well, you keep screwing with me, Reed, and I'm gonna get you where it hurts. - I don't like you, Brenner. I don't like you at all. Now I'm gonna make you pay big time for Mike Quinn and I'm going to enjoy the hell out of it too. - [Announcer] Miller foursome, the first tee. Gladdis's foursome in nine minutes. - Will wonders never cease? Jack Reed in a tie and wearing a jacket, it almost fits. - I'm gonna take some of the employees around, you ready? We're the only ones wearing neckties. - The American dream, where anybody can grow up and have two jobs to make ends meet. (Jack chuckles) - That's a piece of cake. The rich drunks almost never pull knives. Hop in, I gotta make the round. - What, the hard hat part of the uniform too? - No, that's my idea. All right, so Phil Brenner's phone records disappear thanks to Pete Myers. Why would Pete Myers, Mr. Machine himself, a bullet-proof political fixer if there ever was one, why would he get involved in Phil Brenner's legal problems? - Easy. Brenner's a computer guy for Myers. That's why he works out of the treasurer's office. - So he keeps financial records for Myers. Maybe the whole organization. - The sensitive ones, if you catch my drift. - [Golfer] Fore. (soft thud) - Hey. - Jeez, what the hell? - Hole's over there, pal. - Sorry, you okay? - Like a shooting gallery. - Sorry. - It's okay, it's all right. We're fine. Reach behind your chair there. Eddie, what would you like to bet the last couple of days, Mr. Phil Brenner has been tearing apart his house, all of his personal records? Carefully removing every reference to Sarah Landry, to Mick and Bobby, to that lawyer, Anne Keifer? - Oh no, Jack, no. - And all this potential evidence is just sitting there in big green garbage bags. - I'm not gonna do it, Jack. - Waiting for the regular collection, which happens to be tomorrow, I checked. - No. - Unless, unless it should be intercepted and carefully examined by Eddie Dirkson, garbage detective. (loud bang) - [Officer] Don't move, don't move. Everybody down, everybody down. All clear. - [Officer] All clear. - Two hours. Snitch said he was here two hours ago. - [John] Mom, I need my shirt. - I'll be there in a minute. Jack, come on, your eggs are ready. - Yeah, what happened to my hip waders? - Hip waders. They're in the basement, wrapped around the hot water heater. - Really? (chuckles) - Hello. - Hi, Eddie. We had a leak last year, they fit perfectly. What are you all dressed up for? - Ask your husband. - Mr. Dirkson, what are you all dressed up for? - Ask your father. - [John] Mom, my shirt. - I'm coming. How are they? - Hot, but I love the smell of warm rubber in the morning. - Going fishing, Dad? (Eddie laughs) - Sort of. We got a trash run. - Oh no, is there a dog? - I don't know, is there a dog, Sarah? - A dog? I'm sorry, I'm lost. - We're gonna go through Phil Brenner's garbage today. So please tell Arlene and Eddie that he doesn't have a dog. - He doesn't have a dog. (Eddie sighs) But he does have two cats. - Woah, Jack, you're worse. (everyone laughs) - Better get going, Eddie, before the sun gets any hotter. - Okay, Jack, but I'm not touching the kitty litter. That's all yours. (Nicole laughs) - Bye. - [Nicole] Bye Dad, I love you. - Now Nicole, I'll fix your cereal. - No Mom, just grapefruit please. I've got three more pounds to go before the prom. - What about breakfast? - [Nicole] Mom. - You have all been so wonderful. Jack works so hard. I'm afraid I haven't been very much help to him. - Well, that's just it, you're afraid. We understand that. - Yeah, that's true. I've been sick with fear for months and I'm tired of it. - Has he ever hurt you, Sarah? (slow music) - It just came out of nowhere. He was sitting at his computer and (slow piano music) he was looking at this file, this really weird name, Humpty Dumpty, and I made this really stupid joke and he just went crazy. I was in the hospital for three days and they took care of everything. They took care of the doctors, the medical bills, the dentist. - Who's they? - Ever since it happened, I can't get it out of my mind. It's like I've been frozen. Just turned to stone. - Mike's funeral is on Thursday. - Who? - Mike Quinn. The police officer who was trying to help you. Sarah, if you do nothing, Brenner wins. Is that what you want? To spend the rest of your life hiding while he goes on hurting people? And what about Mike? - [John] Mom. - Okay, wiseguy. Take it off, I'll do your shirt. - It's okay. I kinda like it. What do you think, Sarah? Sarah? (upbeat hip-hop music) - [Garbage Collector] Right there. Hey, how you doing? All done. - Morning, morning. Woah. Yeah, you got a lot of garbage today, huh? Here you go. Big boy breakfast and coffee. Thanks, we appreciate it. - Come on, come on, Jack. Before it gets any riper, let's go. - Thanks a lot, fellas. - There it is. There it is, Jack, it's all yours. - I'll get it, all right? I'll get it. - Okay, go ahead. Yeah, yeah, yeah, get it out of here. I can relax a little. Well, I'll say this about Brenner. Maybe a cop killer, but he puts out nice garbage. That's shred in here, Jack. He's got a shredder. We're wasting our time. - There's no pink here. - What? - There's no pink. Telephone message pads are pink. We want his telephone messages, so keep looking. - This is ridiculous. Man, this guy eats a lot of fruit, doesn't he? - Give me that, quit talking. - Wait a minute, Jack, wait a minute. Look here, hold on. - That's it. That is definitely it. (slow suspenseful music) - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm finished. - Romado's pizza, 555-0122. I guess they deliver, huh? That's a big help, buddy. - Yeah well, what do you got, big shot? - Well, I got one here that says meet with Mick and Bobby at 6:30 regarding the murder of Sarah Landry. - Let me see that. Oh, very funny. (Jack chuckles) What's it say here, Rumpelstiltskin 37K94. What the hell's that? - I don't know, but there's a bunch of them. Hey, there's Little Jack Horner 17K94. Red Riding Hood 33K9493. Old Mother Hubbard, 27K94. Mary's Little Lamb 14K94. - Well, it's gotta be payoffs. - Yeah, machine business of some kind. The years are obvious, '93, '94. The Ks could be thousands, as in thousands of dollars. $27,000, 27K, but the names. What do the names mean? - [Secretary] Mr. Brenner, it's the alarm company. - [Phil] Who? - [Secretary] The alarm company. The alarm at your house has been triggered. (slow suspenseful music) - This is Phil Brenner. (building suspense music) (slow suspenseful music) It make any sense, Sarah? - No. It doesn't make any sense, none of it does. It never did. - No, and you're here just out of simple curiosity, right? What about these printouts? They're just curiosity too? You made it easy for me, Sarah. The alarm company reports an intruder. I rush home, I panic, I shoot. Tragedy. - Please, Phil, please don't-- - Hurt you? - Hurt me. - You sneak into my house. You steal from me. - I just did it just-- - Huh? Look at you. - (sobs) Don't. - Look at you, you're a loser. - No. - You're a pathetic little loser. - No. - And I don't know what I ever saw in you. - [Sarah] Stop saying that to me. (clothes ripping) (grunts) - What are you doing? - Go 'head, Phil. Shoot me. Shoot me and then you try to explain to the cops why you tried to rape an intruder before you killed her. Come on, Phil, do it. Do it. Do it! I don't care anymore, but Jack Reed does and if you kill me, he's gonna care a lot more and if you kill him, there's gonna be more cops, Phil and more and more and more and you can't kill everybody, Phil. You're finished. No matter what you do to me, you're finished, you bastard. - Sarah. - Stop it. (loud slap) I'm not afraid of you anymore, Phil. Isn't that wonderful? (slow hip-hop music) ♫ You have to fall a victim ♫ Man, look both ways ♫ You have to fall a victim ♫ Yeah ♫ As long as you're on the streets ♫ Fall a bit, what's creeping up on you ♫ Creeping up on you ♫ You have to fall a victim ♫ Look both ways ♫ You have to fall a bit, what's creeping up on you ♫ Creeping up on you ♫ As long as you're on the streets ♫ You better keep the same, look both ways ♫ Don't fall a victim to the crimes, damage your minds ♫ It's the symptoms ♫ It's always creeping up on you, creeping up on you ♫ In your face, when you've seen other place ♫ Then you are other place ♫ It's the dangerous life there on the streets ♫ A little far-fetched ♫ The only thing about that is what's gonna happen next ♫ Get in the shack ♫ I held my glock cocked ♫ So ready to pop ya ♫ Give me your moneys, now what's funny ♫ I think I gotcha ♫ Go on ♫ Go on, that's what you are, an empty seven ♫ Infiltration since you were on the stairway to heaven ♫ Believe it or not ♫ The crimes is the symptoms ♫ As long as you're ♫ On the streets (gunshots) (voices chattering) - [Charles] You guys up early. - Haven't been to bed yet. - Yeah, you ain't showered yet either. What's that stink? - That stink is Phil Brenner's garbage. We heard Bobby Dixon's name on the net, what's up? - He raided this crack house. - You're kidding. - Positive ID from one of the guys who shot him. We got two dead, two wounded and then he's got cash, drugs, and a new automatic. He's also got a fresh wound and I hope it's serious. - This guy's like the Viet Cong. - Yeah, and unless I get very lucky in the next couple hours, the police commissioner is gonna have me for breakfast. Anything in Brenner's trash? - A very creative accounting system, which we can't figure out of course. - So it's been a perfect day so far, huh? (Jack chuckles) Look, go home, get some sleep. Call me later, I might be up patrolling again. (Jack chuckles) (voices chattering) - [Arlene] Come on everybody, dinner's ready. - Hey. (Jack yawns) - I slept for 10 hours. I've never done that before. - Ha. - Woah, woah, woah, what's so funny? - It's true, Sarah. Jack hardly ever sleeps more than nine hours, nine and a half tops. - Get out of here. How you feeling? - [Sarah] Great, I feel really great. - Good. After dinner, we'll compare notes on Phil Brenner and his interest in nursery rhyme characters. I gotta thank you. That was a very gutsy thing to do and very helpful too and don't ever do it again, okay? - Okay. (Arlene sniffs) - Mm. Eau de garbage. Did you take a bath? - Yes, I took a bath. I took two baths. - Well, it didn't work. Go wash your hands and use the strong soap. - Arlene. Arlene, the DEA could use your nose to sniff baggage at the airport. (Arlene chuckles) With those nose, right Arlene? All right, well, you're gonna love this stuff because it takes the skin right off. (gunshot) (woman screams) (glass shatters) (suspenseful music) - [Arlene] Jack. - I'm okay. All right, just stay down, just stay down. - What is it, Dad? - Don't worry, he's just trying to scare us. - Well, he's doing a hell of a job. - Who's trying to scare us, why? - Come on, come on, come on, come on, answer the phone. 911. Yeah, listen, I'm a police officer. I'm calling from 361 Crescent Drive in Old Lane Park. Someone just fired a shot into my house. (knocking) - What? - Come on, come on, come on, come on, open it up. - [Phil] Reed, what the hell are you here for? - Just wanna talk. Just a probe. (Phil grunts) Come on, come on, see how high you can get? - Oh, that hurts. - Come on. Use those fingernails. Come on, higher, higher. - [Pete] Reed. Take your hands off him. - Well, well, well. If it isn't Pete Myers himself. Is this a social visit, Pete? Or is it a setup? (Phil grunts) Is it a setup? You listen to me. If anything happens to my family, if my kid so much as scrapes his knee, I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna take these with me. (Phil grunts) - You're finished, Reed. This is police brutality. You're all through. - Yeah, why don't you tell it to Little Jack Horner or Rumpelstiltskin, huh? Yeah, Pete. Remember what I said. Next time, I'll turn them into cuff links. - [Manny] Phil. - No, no, no, no, don't touch me. (chuckles) I got him. I got him. (chuckles) - How'd you get him so riled up? No, don't tell me. How'd he know about Little Jack Horner and Rumpelstiltskin? - Don't worry. This time I got him, right Manny? - [Manny] If you say so, Phil. - Yeah, but I don't wanna hear about it. Just hope it's better than your Sarah Landry scheme. This is your mess, Brenner. You get it cleared up. (Phil laughs) (Phil grunts) (phones ringing) (voices chattering) (Charles knocking) - How's the family, Jack? Pretty shook up, huh? - Yeah, well, the kids are kind of upset. Sarah's a little jumpy. Of course Arlene is just mad as hell. - Yeah, I heard Sarah Landry's been staying there. I don't know if that's a good idea, Jack. - Well, it's Arlene's idea, Charles. Why don't you talk to her about it? - Well, like I said, I think it's a hell of a good idea. (Jack chuckles) I'm gonna put a car in front of the house around the clock starting tomorrow. - I appreciate it. - Now you do me a favor. Stay away from Phil Brenner. - They make a formal complaint? - Myers talked to the sheriff, I can handle it, but no more, okay? I got enough to worry about with Bobby Dixon. - Yeah, I'm sorry, it was stupid. I did exactly what Brenner wanted me to do. - Well, forget it. Work on the computer stuff. (phone rings) Yeah. Okay. Your cell phone's ringing at your desk. (phone ringing) (slow suspenseful music) - Would you smile please? Come on, just one. (camera shutter clicking) Come on, Nicole, smile. Just give me a smile, sweetie. - Mom, this is ridiculous. I'd rather stay home than go to the prom with a bodyguard. - Everybody smile, say prom. - Aw, come on, Nicole. You have to go, it's your junior prom. - [Arlene] Your dad's worried about you, sweetie. Besides, you'll never even know Eddie's there. - Oh god. - I wonder where Jack is. He wanted to be here before you left. I tried to call him, but I guess he's out of range. - Mom, please. - Eddie, drive carefully. - Now listen, sport, from now on, you keep your eyes up, okay? Above the neck at all times, all right, huh? Now let's go, kids, we're gonna have fun. - Mom. - [Eddie] Come on, I'll drive. You kids are all in the front seat. - Eddie looks good. (Arlene and Sarah laugh) - [Phil] Hey, what the hell do you want? Huh? Well, come on. (gunshot) (Phil grunts) (slow suspenseful music) (grunting) Yeah, 911. I've been shot. Yeah, shot. 3043 Ram's Gate. I'm in my car out in front. I need help right away. Yeah, I know who shot me. He's a cop. His name is Jack Reed, he's a cop. - Thought I recognized your car. What's up? - Phil Brenner got shot tonight. - Is he dead? - He's in bad shape, maybe paralyzed. Where have you been, Jack? (Jack chuckles) - I've been in the parking lot of the Forest Preserve out at Matthews. - All night? - Since about 8:00. I had a date with an informant, he didn't show. - Who's the informant? - I don't know. He called me, no names he said. - [Charles] You tell anybody about this meet? - No, I didn't tell anybody. His rules. He wanted to talk about Brenner's computer codes. That's an interesting coincidence, huh? - Yeah, since Brenner says you shot him. - That's a damn lie. - He was shot at point blank range and he swears you did it and we got the gun, it came out of our property safe. - It's still a lie. - Arlene, could you give us a minute please? - It's okay, it's all right. I'll be up in a few minutes. - Did you do it, Jack? - If I did it, he'd be dead and the gun would be gone and I'd have a hell of an alibi. No, I swear. I didn't do it, Charles. - Okay. - I guess I'm on suspension or am I under arrest? - You're not even a suspect. - What? - We were together tonight. You told me about the informant yesterday. You picked me up at 7:30 in your car. We sat out there for three hours. Nobody showed. You never left my sight, not even to go to the bathroom. (slow piano music) You understand? - [Jack] Charles. - Yeah? - I can't play it that way and neither can you. I'm on suspension. I'll be at Mike Quinn's funeral in the morning. If internal affairs wants to pick me up, they can do it there. - Want me to call a lawyer? - First I gotta talk to my family. Listen, Charles. Thanks. - Yeah. (bagpipe music) - [Woman] Thank you. - [Captain] On the guard, ten-hut. Police, ten-hut. Right shoulder, hut. On the guard, right hut. Shoulder, hut. (voices chattering) - Sergeant Reed? Breslin of Internal Affairs. We gotta place you under arrest. - Okay. - I gotta cuff you, Sarge. - Oh, come on. Don't be ridiculous. - Hey, it's regulation. Don't bust my hide. - [Jack] It's okay, it's okay. - Hey, hey, hey, put those things away. I got a judicial order here. Reed is released and we're pending a full grand jury investigation and indictment. - What? You know how long that can take? - You in a big hurry to lock up a cop, Breslin? - [Breslin] Lieutenant, just doing my job. - Yeah right. Well, your job is to obey this writ. You can read the big words. Insufficient probable cause. Release into Lieutenant Silvera's custody. - All right, all right, Lieutenant. Just have him at Brenner's bedside at 1:00 pm for an ID. If there's any problem with that, call Inspector Rollins at Internal Affairs. - [Charles] Rollins, the creep. - You must have been up all night to get that thing. - One phone call and it was hand delivered this morning. You got a lot of friends, Jack. - I know I do, thanks. Well, we got a couple of hours before we're due at the hospital. Maybe we should get a sandwich. - Well, damn, let's get a beer. (Charles chuckles) (beeping) - Mr. Brenner, can you see the man who shot you? Who shot you, Mr. Brenner? - He did. Jack Reed shot me. (voices chattering) - Inspector Rollins, we'll going to the grand jury this afternoon, so if I were you, I wouldn't make any plans for the weekend, Reed. - Hey, Breslin. You're not gonna put him in jail. Even Rollins wouldn't do that. - Lieutenant, he's gonna be indicted for attempted murder. Not even your friendly judge can get him out of that. - I'll see you guys later. I gotta go to this stupid lunch and I'm already late. I think it stinks, Jack. - I'll talk to you later, Eddie. - You should have done it my way. - We'll make it work. Hey, what's going on with Bobby Dixon? - Nothing. Now go home and stay there and don't answer the phone. It's gonna get crazy. - Yeah. (slow suspenseful music) (phone rings) - What? Didn't I tell you to hold the calls? Who? - [Jack] 34. - [Sarah] Mopery? - [Jack] Mopery. - Mopery, mopery is not a word. - Sure it is. - What's it mean? - It's a crime. A mope is guilty of mopery. - Which is? - Hanging around for no good reason. (Sarah chuckles) Misdemeanor mopery and there's felony mopery. (phone rings) - Oh god. What do they want? - They smell blood. Be up to our butts in TV crews before too long. - How did Brenner do this? Who shot him? - Stick up. Car jacking. He figures why waste it, so he accuses me. I don't know, but he's got me. He's got me good. - What are you gonna do? - We were a loving Christian family. (phones ringing) (voices chattering) My husband worked in a steel mill. An important job, a puddler, if you know what that means. We had a nice house on the South Side and were very active in the church. I tell you all these things, not in foolish pride, but so you may understand that when the drugs came, it was like a wild and terrible plague. The fire storm that destroyed everything it touched. My sister. My two brothers. My daughter. - My brother. - These two boys that were shot the other day and the young police officer. You sure it was Bobby, Lieutenant? I don't want nobody else getting hurt. I know where he might be. It was an important place for him when he was a child. (soft choral singing) It was the center of our lives, heart and soul of the neighborhood. He used to love it there. ♫ Yes, Jesus loves me - [Mrs. Harris] He was a singer in the choir. He had a beautiful boy soprano voice. ♫ Yes, Jesus loves me - Everybody loved to hear him sing. (Bobby yells) (phones ringing) I'll show you this place, Lieutenant, on one condition. - [Eddie] Jack, Eddie, I'm at the Lake Michigan Hotel. How fast can you get here? - [Jack] What's up, Eddie? - [Eddie] Just get over here. - All right, I'm here, what's going on? - Take a look at this. - What, what, what, what am I supposed to be looking at? - Second item. 12:00 noon? - Francine, Francine Hood, how 'bout that. Well, I haven't talked to her in years. - Yeah, I've been sitting in there for about an hour trying to stay awake. Then it jumped up and bit me. - 25 years. It's hard to believe. 25 years ago today, I swore an oath as a police officer. Law school, the DA's office, private practice and now for the last 10 years, the bench. It's been hard. It's been hectic. - All right, so what jumped up and bit you? (slow suspenseful music) - [Eddie] Little Jack Horner. - Come on, Eddie, you're reaching. - [Eddie] Rumpelstiltskin. (audience laughs) - Mary's Little Lamb. - Red Riding Hood. (audience applauds) - So that's what this is all about, crooked judges. (audience chattering) - [Eddie] Here comes Pete Myers. Nail him, Jack. - No. Not Myers, we'll never get Myers. He's too smart. - Reed. You looking for a new job? Or just a friendly judge for your trial? - Well, Francine Hood and I go way back, Pete. Back before she became Little Red Riding Hood. I'll be seeing you, Pete. Francine. Hey. - Jack Reed. My favorite cop. I've been reading about your problems. Are you okay? - Yeah. We need to talk. - Sure. We'll go to dinner at Carson's, just like the old days. - No, we need to talk right now. - Come on, Jack. Most of this is guesswork. - That's true. - But you brought it to me anyway. Why? - Tell me something, Francine. When you pass sentence these days as a judge, do you still talk about responsibility? About how important it is for people to accept personal responsibility for their actions? - I haven't lectured anybody in quite a while, Jack. - Oh, that's too bad. I used to like that lecture. - You're pretty smart, aren't you? - [Both] For a cop. (slow suspenseful music) - It doesn't happen all the time of course. And there are rules. You have to hire the right lawyer and the lawyer does all the dirty work and there's never a shortage of them. It has to be a close call. We don't want the losers suspecting that the judge has been bought. And the stakes have to be high enough that a $3,000 or $4,000 bribe makes sense. The lawyer delivers the cash to Philip Brenner. - And Brenner banks it for the machine. - Half of it. It's an incentive system, Jack. This is America, right? You remember my daughter, Peggy. She's at Northwestern. Do you know how much money that is? And Robert. You know about Robert, Jack. He's in a special school. It's wonderful, but it costs. God, listen to me. I sound like one of those jerks who stands up in front of me, whining away, guilty, but with an excuse, Your Honor. I did it. I knew it was wrong and I did it anyway. - I'm sorry, Francine. - So what happens now? - I guess we go see the U.S. Attorney. - Are you gonna handcuff me? - Nah, we don't handcuff material witnesses. - [Francine] What? - You called me. You were feeling pretty guilty. You wanted to tell the whole story to an old friend and you're willing to cooperate. You're wanting to testify if necessary. - Yeah. - You're a material witness, right Eddie? - That's right, Jack. - Thanks, Jack. - Francine. We've been looking for you. The photographer's here, everybody wants a picture. - I'm sorry, Pete. It's all over. I have a date with the U.S. Attorney. - Francine, that's crazy. Reed, he hasn't got anything. Don't do this. - I should've done it 10 years ago, Pete. Let's go, Jack. - This isn't gonna help you, Reed. You're going to jail for shooting Phil Brenner no matter what she does. - And the way your luck's been running lately, Pete, you'll probably have the cell right next to me. - 'Scuse me. (slow eerie music) (Bobby sobbing) - Jesus loves me. This I know. For the Bible tells me so - [Mrs. Harris] Bobby. - Grandma? - [Mrs. Harris] Yes, it's grandma. - I'm sick, Grandma. - [Mrs. Harris] I know. - Can I sleep in your bed tonight, Grandma? - Yes, baby. - When's Mom coming home? Grandma? - Soon. She'll be home soon. - I've been bad, Grandma. - Yes. You've been a bad boy, Bobby. - I didn't mean to. It wasn't my fault. - Yes. It was your fault. You done terrible things and you're responsible, baby. No one else. - I know. I'm so sorry, Grandma. - But it's all over now. Now you're gonna get better and you're gonna confess your sins and accept your punishment like a man and you're gonna be redeemed and I will help you. Come pray with me, baby. Lord Jesus. (Mrs. Harris whispering) - Okay, we're clear. Send in the paramedics and a stretcher. (voices chattering) - I'm looking for Phil Brenner please? - 303. - Is this Phil Brenner's room? - Yeah, I think that's the guy's name. - [Manny] How's he doing? - You a relative? - A friend. - He ain't doing great, pal. Small caliber, soft slug, and we really tore him up inside. Kidney, liver, spinal thing too. He's a mess. Go on in and talk to him. Never gets any visitors. - No, he's sleeping. - Yeah, wake him up. He won't mind. - I don't wanna get him upset. - If you're his friend, why would he get upset? - 'Cause I shot him. I didn't wanna do it, it was crazy. I don't know anything about guns. He said we'll use a .22 and a target bullet. I can't remember. - A wadcutter? - Yeah, a wadcutter. Soft, it's got no power. It can't do any damage. - Not at 20 or 30 feet, but at point blank range? - It's the steroids. He thinks he can do anything and he wanted to get Reed. Said if we nail Reed, the whole mess with Sarah goes away. We were standing at the car. He says, "Do it." I said, "I can't do it, Phil." Then he grabs the gun. He pulls it into his belly and it goes off and now, I mean, what do I say to him? - How 'bout oops? (melancholy piano music) - Hi, I'm just gonna be a minute, okay? - [Driver] All right. - I feel like I'm leaving home. - Well, good, then we'll expect you for Thanksgiving. (Sarah chuckles) - Are you sure you're okay about moving back in with Becky? - Oh yeah. It's just for a couple days and then I'm gonna get my own place. It's time and I am gonna get a new job, someplace where they appreciate me. - Good girl. - I don't know how to thank you, both of you and John and Nicole. - That's what families are for, right? - Sarah.
