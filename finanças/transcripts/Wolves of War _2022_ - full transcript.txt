And that is when the moon went missing. The world turned dark. And without her mother's charm, the little princess did not find her way home. The forest crept closer and closer as she... - Daddy. - Yes? Why did the moon leave her? Doesn't her mum love her anymore? It's not in their power, Martha. Once a month, the moon has to leave. Why? That's the way the world works. But now she hasn't got any protection. Well, maybe it's time she learned how to protect herself and the ones she loves the most. See. Crept closer and closer as she wandered through the night. She was scared, but had a good heart. Is that why you leave? Yes, but I'm clever. And I will always find a way home. I promise. It's late. We'll finish the story another time. Will you be good for your aunt? Here. What's this? Not the moon. That's very kind of you, Martha. I'll treasure it. - Goodnight, Daddy. - Goodnight. Everything all right, sir? No need for formalities. Well, in that case, pleasure to meet you. - Jack Wallace. - Yeah, I know. I know who you are. It's an honor, sir. Never thought I'd be on a mission with a war hero. War hero? What did he do? He single-handedly took out 20 Kraut tanks in their own camp. - What? - I was just following orders. Oh, come on, man. You killed hundreds. How did you do it? - With a bomb. - Brilliant. And what's a war hero doing on a recce? I just go where I'm told to. Ah, good soldier, aye? Can't trust us. And who are you? I'm Killian Deegan. I'm too invisible to be a war hero. Ah, funny, I like it. Funny? That's fighting talk where I come from. - Oh yeah? - Mm. Go on. So, what's a war hero and a sniper doing on an exploration? 'Cause I know that this, this is abandoned territory. Well, the war is over, isn't it? It soon will be. With a bit of luck, this will be the last mission for all of us. Is that true, sir? We're winning, aren't we? Morton. Right, listen up. We jump in four miles. We meet at the church. Memorize it. Check your weapons and get yourselves ready to go. Get down! Need a hand, quick! Keep the pressure on. The plane's fecking wrecked. What's the situation? It's not looking good, sir. We can't land here. Forget landing. You need to jump now. Boys, get ready! What about Morton? Get the map and take his radio. You're our new comms guy. Hope you're a fast learner. Where the hell did you bring us? I'll clear the area. Look after him. When you hit the deck, you lie, you lie still until I find you. I've never done this before. You need to leave now! They showed me on the ground, but I didn't jump. You'll be fine. Arms in, pull the chord! What do you mean? You pushed me out of a plane? What did you expect? I'm not one of your soldiers. You don't say. Stay behind me and shut up. Here. If I tell you, point this and pull the trigger. Come on, stay close. Sir. Just leave him here for them to find. You're not here to question me. Sorry, I don't understand. You shot our interpreter. Gestapo? No ID tags. Yeah, same here. They've all got these. It's not any division I've ever heard of. They don't look like Wehrmachts. Probably locals, militia. Not supposed to be any allied action within 1,000 miles of here. Well, let's hope nobody heard this then. Jeez, it's Owens. Is that the same symbol as before? It looks like it. Well, should we get him down or... They'll know we've been here. Wait. You tricked us, Norwood. This isn't a recce. No, it's not. So what is this mission really about, and what is that clown doing here? That clown is why we're here. Your job is to not let him out of your sight. Come on. Hold this. And that. Gotcha. Some war hero. This is not a game. Didn't mean to hurt your feelings, man. There's no glory in any of this. Well, then. You do have a good memory. Any enemy contacts? I'm invisible, remember? Where's Owens? Ah. Some recce. Find your way up that spire and get the radio out. Let me know when you've contacted comms. The man we're after is an American scientist. His name's Professor Hopper. He's lived in Germany for the past 25 years, and our mission is to bring him home, where he'll get put to work winning this war. And according to his fellow scientist, Connor here, every war to come. Scientist, aye? Connor's from Harvard University. He's here to help us identify Hopper. And to access any written work we find. Bring him back and the relevant papers. So what is it? It's 1.2 million tonnes of TNT. The world's first atomic weapon. A bomb. Why didn't you tell us? 'Cause I needed all your skills. And I didn't think you'd want to come. Well, if it's that bad I'm glad we're so many. At least we got a war hero on our side. Right down there, in the cellar. Baker Street were in contact with Hopper's daughter. She was on our side, apparently. They cooked up some plan to smuggle them out of Berlin. But when the Americans broke through in the Ardennes, the SS moved our man to a decommissioned air base about half a dozen miles from here. That is our target. So we lost our comms guy and our medic. Like I get why we were all picked, but we're depleted. There's three and a half of us. We can't take an airbase. Abandoned airbase. Abandoned or not, if he's everything you say he is, they'll be protecting this brain box with more than an army. That's why if we don't have him in our custody by the end of tomorrow night, the RAF come in. And they bomb the base, the man, and all of his research to kingdom come. Best case, we get the research. Worst case, we all die. But most importantly, we get him before the Reds catch him. The Russians. Fecking Reds? Bomb him now, what are we doing here? No, no, no, we need to know how much Professor Hopper knows, okay? And if it's good, if it can help us win the war, then we gotta take it. Anything? No. Where is everyone? They probably moved him. Safety's off. High alert. Move out. Corporal, take Connor. Clear one on the left. Wallace, you're with me, we'll do the one on the right. It's Russian. Jesus. I bet it's some kind of Russian scout forces. Where's Connor? Should see for yourself. You left him? Shit. There he is. Hopper is a damn genius. This is incredible. Guys? This is that Russian scout force. Bloody Reds. Well, it looks like we're too late. Let's go home, lads. Not till we find Hopper. Find him? I think you'll find he'll be dead. We don't know that. This local militia is a lot stronger than we thought then. Where do you think they would take Hopper? Do we even know whose side these militia are on? Well, you can bet it's not ours. Sir, what are your orders? Before we left, I was told there's this old resistance SOE asset. Hungarian farmer, lives about six miles from here. I haven't heard from him since D-Day. It's been dark for 10 months, sir. Might be dead then, no? Maybe, but we've got to find out where that militia is. What if your man's joined the militia himself? There is no escape plan. So without the professor, they ain't coming to get us. Which means that any lead we have is one that we have to follow. Well, I guess we know whose side their on. We go in. No one moves. You can't let this happen. There are women and children there. We stay down. Wait. Stand down, Sergeant. But, sir, there are children there. That is an older, Sergeant. Sir. If you do this, they'll be all over us. We can't risk this mission. We don't even know we have a mission anymore. That is not your family. Stay alert. What are you doing? Going inside. What are you doing? Get up, man. Jesus, you can't sit there. We're looking for your husband. My husband is dead for six years. And thank you for your service. English or American? English. There's no one else here, and I'm too hungry to run for it. So tell your boys at the back to be careful of my lettuces. Thank you. Do I have a choice? Bitte. Is this all of you? Rather disappointing, isn't it? It depends on how good you are. Excuse my friend. He's had a rough few years. Thank you for your hospitality. But that's not why you're here. We're looking for someone. He's a professor, a scientist. Right, not many days ago, a group of them passed through here. They were transporting someone important. But that could be him. - Was he alive? - Yes. They seemed to take good care to protect him. There were a lot of them. And do we know who these rogue boys are? When Hitler saw he was losing the war, he ordered every Aryan in the Vaterland to form a militia. Angry, young, poor boys to continue the struggle against the invaders. They call themselves the Wolf's Angels. A young man called Von Sachs is their leader. What's the point if they already lost? These young boys get brainwashed. You call it propaganda. They have so much pain and loss, and therefore it's an escape. Even if their mother tells them not to go. Is everything all right, soldier? Where did they take him? They have a base 10 kilometers from here. It will not be easy to capture him. You have a radio, don't you? An old one, yes. Well, let's see if we can get it working. Anything? That boy, it was her son. She has a right to know. Why do you think she went dark 10 months ago? Her son joined the Wolf's Angels. He's a Nazi, like nearly everyone else around here. She's his mother. I don't trust her. No matter. She'll probably expect him to be there. When she finds out that we've killed him... You killed him. It's a war. People get shot, you should know that. When this is done, when it's over, our families. They'll know we won. If she finds out, you'll shoot her. You wanna take her with us? I have a plan. Two. At least another three inside. What a beauty. What? They're better than humans. There. Oh, thank God. It's him? Yeah, I'm certain of it. Good. He's a brilliant scientist, you know. I should hope so. I didn't expect so many. I thought there would just be some scientists in a lab. Hey, we're two men down, I need you to step up. Okay. They have him. Get yourselves ready. That's a fine new Enfield you got there. If you shoot yourself, can I have it? I got these old one, see? Mind you, they should give me a metal the amount of people I killed with it. It's bravery they give medals for. Come on. God, die, you... Found ya. It's all clear. Some shot. Don't fall in love with me, man. Just following orders. We got work to do, clock's ticking. It's them or us. I used to be a medic. They told us to pull the shrapnel out, sew 'em up and send 'em back out. Look at me. They're the lucky ones, trust me. They die quick. Look at you. Good lad, good lad. That's it, good lad. Easy now. Don't eat the ferns, love. He is a beauty. My family used to keep horses, you know? Breeding them. Without them, we'd have starved. Majestic creatures. Come on. Can I help? War's over for you. Baker Street said we're winning. It don't feel like it. Hasn't in a long time. Feels like a suicide mission. For me, they all do. No one waiting for ya? Oh, there is a special someone. Martha, my daughter. She'll be 12 soon. Are you writing her? It's hard to know what to say sometimes. Be good to get you back to her. Right. I'm sorry we couldn't save the others. The locals, it wasn't easy for me. It didn't look that way. Well, this mission is about more than protecting innocent people. It's about protecting everyone. That's why I picked you. For a suicide mission. You gotta love German efficiency. I preferred you without that. - You got the wine? - Everything you've asked for. And you know what to do. You can trust me. Good luck. Got all the luck I need right here. Relax. Halt! Here. Ja. Stairs. Stay here, unload the box. - Two. - We don't know. We don't know he's in there. Well, who else would they be guarding? Professor Hopper. Are you Americans? It is a great honor meeting you, sir. Well, I would love to say the same, but... Professor, you're coming with us. Connor, check the papers. Take anything we can use. No, excuse me. Oh, we need these. - No, this is my... - Professor, you'll need these papers to continue your work in America. What? I'll get my shoes on. Ja, okay. Nein. - Can I have that? - No. Please? I'll carry it. You take this. So what is your plan exactly to get us out of here? The same way we came in. Move. - You got the notebook? - Yeah, I have it. Okay, we should go. - Let's go. - Ah, ah. Only came for you, not your German mistress. She is my daughter, and I'm not leaving her. - There's no room for two. - Sir. I'm not going any where without her. She better know how to use a gun. Let's go. Did you get the right ones? - Yeah, I think so. - Let's go. Two of them? We have no choice. The box won't hold. We have to try. This really is not... You got another plan, Professor? Now get in the box. They're coming, they're coming. Hold it together. Fraulein. Ja. By the English. Time for revenge. The English are so proud of their weapons, they couldn't even stand to take our guns. Shoot them. Get ready. Well, well, well. Nazi fraulein. Out, out, now! Come out, come out. Come on, move! Stop! Quick, quick. Move, go. - Quick, move, move. - Everyone, go! Move! Move up! Table, go, go, go, go, go. Down! Shit, there's more of them! Now! Keep going! Okay, when I say go you run to the truck, okay? Okay, go! Go, go, go! Norwood, machine gun! Machine gun's fucked! No, wait! What are you doing? Get up, get up, you can do it! No, no, no, it's for Hans. It's for my boy. It's for my son. Go. Go. Go on, go. Come on, just watch it. No! Go, go, go, go! Let's go, let's go! Did anybody see what happened to Deegan? Ah, fuck! They're closing in! - Come on, come on. - Wait, Papa! Down. Is everyone all right? - Ja. - Are you okay? - Ja. - You are? - Okay. - Ja, ja. Yeah. Here they are, look, our old pals. We've got to stop meeting like this, haven't we? Secure the cottage and get them inside. We thought you were a goner, Deegan. Not this time, fellas. Help. Help! Push down the wound. All right. As hard as you can. Wait, let me get it off and see what we're looking at here. - Keep talking to him. - Ja. - Jesus, God. - Papa. Save them. Papa? Please. No, no, don't go! Papa? Papa, don't go. Papa, please! Christ, let me have a look! I'm sorry. No! No, no. No, not Papa. No, Papa. Do something! No, no, no, no, no. No, please. Papa, please! Please. - I'm sorry. - No! You did this. - We were trying... - No! - If you hadn't arrived... - If we hadn't arrived, they would've bombed the place to the ground. He was too important. He was a human being. Murderers. We have to radio Baker Street. Get us out of her alive. Came all this way, yeah? Good luck. Will they even come for us now? He was a brilliant man. So brilliant it got him killed. No, no, what he achieved will save millions and stop pointless wars. Or start them. This. It has all of the notes you want. I hope you're right. I wasn't there when my father died. We didn't have a great relationship. He... He didn't really believe in me. He couldn't understand what I was trying to do. So I, I wrote him this note and I left it on his grave. And I imagine him reading it every day. It helped. You should get some rest. You did a good thing there, taking her with us. She might have been okay. We both know that's not true. If she's anything like you, she'll be fine. You know, there's this old saying that there are two wolves fighting inside all of us. One good, one bad. The wolf that wins is the one we feed the most. When I look into Martha's eyes, I know she'll see what I've become. Maybe it would be easier for her to remember me as the father I was. You don't know that. I see her... everywhere. That's hers. Mm. But I doubt she'll remember it. You should finish that letter. If nothing else, it might make you feel closer to her. What did you write? I've got no one to write to. Did you write this? Did you write this? This is CN and ET to embassy. Receiving, over. This is CN to Embassy. Receiving, over. Tell them he's alive. CN in ET to Embassy. Receiving, over. We have to get them out. This is the embassy, what's your status? We owe them. There is more. They made a prototype. Wait, what are you saying? Everything my father worked to create. Where? It's in a bunker, not far. If you need to take something back then we must retrieve it. Embassy to CN, do you copy? Sir, if there's a prototype, we have to find it. Our orders were to retrieve as much intelligence as possible. Well, it seems to me orders are there to be followed. Thank you. This is Captain Norwood, I have an update. So what did he say? If we haven't got this prototype by 1800 hours, the RAF are gonna hit this area with every bomb they can carry. Any chances of us getting out before that happens? Thank you. We pop a green smoke to signal the all clear. Same plane that was gonna blow us away carries us home. You hear that, Connor? Green smoke's our ticket home. I know where you're going, little bird. Slowly. Go, go. Through here. Otto, Lise. Mutti! Don't worry. These men are going to help us. Hannah, what's going on? Where's the damn prototype? I don't think there is one, sir. You tricked us. We leave, now! No, we have to take them with us. I'm sorry, I had no choice! You were not my mission. What would you do? If these two were yours? How can you expect me to leave my children behind? We can't just leave them. If I had told you the truth, you would have never come here, right? You have to take us with you. If you don't, they will kill us. Please. I believe she knows as much as her father. They developed the bomb together. Is this true? Don't you lie to me. It's true. Sir. Get the kids, we need to go. Von Sachs will know we're here. - Come with us. - Come, Otto. Now! Wait, Miss. I better go out first. Grenade! - Turn back! - Go! Get in, move closer! Move! Move! - You okay? - Yeah, this way. This is the only other way out. We either stay in here and get bombed in 10 minutes or we take our chances. Jesus. - Shit! - Get down, Otto. Wait! Seems like you English have nowhere to go. Rather than us killing the kinder that you come out with your hands up. If you do, we will spare them, and the girl. I only have to give the word and my men will tear through that pathetic tunnel and you all within seconds. Three. Two. Wait. One. Some bloody plan. If we run now, you think we'll reach the bags? I don't think your formulas gonna help you with this. Not everything's a damn joke. The smoke. The pilot will think we're safe. Do we look safe to you? Well, at least Hannah might be. 10 Minutes to target. I'll cover you. Get Hannah and the kids out of here. Sir. Halt. Oh, I see. Your life is worth less than hers, is it? I will enjoy this. I think... he's a heart man. Go, go! Grab the bag with the smoke. Wallace, go, now! Get to cover! Don't let 'em flank us! Fall back on my mark. We got two, bottom of the hill! Now, Deegan! Wallace, go, now! - Rocket! - Brace yourselves! Professor Connor and Fraulein Hannah, welcome to the unit. The bag. I dropped the bag with the smoke. Our only way home! Five minutes, sir. Thank you, Lieutenant. Cockpit to bomber, five minutes. Roger that. Get them behind there. I'll get the smokes. Sir, it should be me. You get yourself home, and that's an order. It'll be suicide, sir. It always is. He's targeting us. Sorry I didn't get to meet Martha. Now that's a war hero shot. Otto, nein! Otto, no! Otto! Go, get outta here! Otto, Otto! Go! Get out of here! Get out of here. I'm a war hero. 10 minutes. Dropping below cloud base. Sir, down! Can you see any green smoke? Commencing bombing run. The tanks moving, give 'em all you got! Ten seconds. Goodbye, Englishman. Firing. Wait, there! Abort, abort! It's too late. Get down! No! Are you okay? Ja. Yeah? Ja. Sir? Sir, it's Connor. I'm here, okay. Okay. I need to push down hard on the wound, sir. This might hurt. Stay with me. I'm... I'm sorry, I...
