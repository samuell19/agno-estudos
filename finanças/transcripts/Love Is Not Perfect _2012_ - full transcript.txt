UNDER THE TAX CREDIT RULES LOVE IS NOT PERFECT A FILM BY WITH ASSISTANT DIRECTOR PUBLISHING SECRETARY GENERAL ORGANIZER SOUND ENGINEER COSTUMES Hello? Beba, hi. A shrink? Can't you find one yourself? Cut it out, I'm not your nursemaid, stop thinking I have no life of my own. Sweet, as usual. No, I was going out to do something important, and not for work. I won't say, it's my business. Okay, I'll try. ASSEMBLY I don't know if he'll be a hunk! Okay, bye. SUBJECT AND SCRIPT BASED ON "L'AMORE Ãˆ IMPERFETTO" BY FRANCESSA MUCI - How may I help you? - No, no, I'm good. PRODUCED BY DIRECTED BY OFFICE BUILDING - Come in, please. - Thank you. Hello, I'm Dr. Galbiati, what is it? I need an appointment with Dr. Villanova. - Are you his patient? - No. Who suggested us? The plaque, I go by often, I noticed it and... I'll check the schedule. What should be said is, the subconscious cannot be ordered. You'll have to wait to see the doctor. Next available appointment is month and a half later. But if you like, I have time in two weeks. Yes, alright. Thursday 18, 4:30 p.m. - What's the name? - Bollani, Roberta. I'll be waiting, Mrs. Bollani. It's not me, it's my closest friend, she's a lawyer. She's busy and asked me to find a therapist, it's not for me. I find the right people for her, for others, I'm a disaster for myself! I don't even believe in therapy, we should resolve our own problems. I cross the line at paying someone to listen to my messes. Am I a windbag? Maybe. I'll tell my friend, she'll be very happy. You're not fucking me around! It's not the first time you say something and I find out it's bullshit! I've never set limits for you! Have I ever been a pain? Have I ever been a pain? I don't think so. I don't give a fuck, okay? A cappuccino, please. Steaming. How can I stand being with a guy like you? You're such an asshole! THERAPIST OK. Thank you. Just a moment, the sugar... It's brown sugar, I don't know if that's alright. - Thank you. - You're welcome. My scooter! Are you hurt? Let me help you. What a bitch! Your daughter ruined my bike! She's not my daughter, so cut it out. Give me a hand. Gabbing on the phone, she fell off like a shithead. Calm down! Where's the phone? Right there. Calm down. What's wrong? Take care of the girl, I'll give this guy my contact information. It's just a cut over the eyebrow, does anything hurt? Can you move it? - Let's take her to Emergency. - Coming. Here's my number. - Thank you. - Thank you. Still here? I was inside for over an hour. It wasn't long. Anyway, it's my free day, I can wait. - Did they examine her? - Yes. It's just her leg, ice will be enough, and she's got an abrasion over an eyebrow. They took me for her mother, like that lunatic before! No, too young. - The girl? - No, you. Great, at least someone! Thanks. - Did you know her? - No. My scooter knew her better. - I just know her name's Adriana. - I'm Ettore. Elena. Like a tale by Homer! - This was our Odyssey. - Iliad. Ettore and Elena are in the Iliad. They'll discharge her in 15 minutes. - Can't I take you home? - Here's fine, thanks. - It was a pleasure. - For me too. Apart from the accident. Bye. - Wasn't that your husband? - No! Too old, don't you think? You made a nice couple. - Do you live here? - No, somewhere else. You could have had a lift... My dad's studio is here, my mum will chew me out seeing me like this. Let's say that my dad's... Softer. He still feels guilty for dumping us! - He's Dr. Villanova? - Yes, are you his patient? No, I read the plaque. Now, please, be careful! I swear I'll never sit on your scooter again. On any scooter, seeing how hyper you get on the phone. Bye. - Thank you. - Not at all. Elena! You have a good scent. Thank you. Elena! Wait! What is it? Dad's not here, give me a lift? - I just have one helmet. - It's not far. - But two with one helmet... - I can't with this leg! - I have no helmet. - Please! No! Hold on! Can I have your number? Won't you want to know if I'm dead or alive? Okay. 338 942267. I'll call you so you'll get mine. How old are you? What a question! 35. I'm 18. I look older and you look younger, right? Thank you, that's sweet. Wait. Take me with you, please, at least for tonight. I can't face her. Your mother will be worried. I'll say I'm staying with a friend. No, really... You're crying? Don't you ever cry? She's nuts! Wait for me! Good morning, Elena. Warm today, isn't it? You're washing the stairs, drats, I'm in heels! EIGHT YEARS EARLIER - Having a party? - With Beba we always party. Finally! No, Marco, don't take my picture, I hate to be photographed! I said no! I like it when you get mad! You've never seen me really mad. - Scared I'll steal your soul? - Scared I'll steal this? Sorry... He's single, handsome, he came into this house and must stay here. One of us has to sleep with him. It's a question of principle. Single? Isn't he with that redhead babe? No way... Just a work relationship, she told me. What can I say? Sleep with him if you like. I don't need your permission. But I think he prefers you. - Don't make that face. - What face? Idiot face. What can I say, that I like him? Yes, I do, a lot. So? So... let's make a bet: the first to sleep with him, wins. Come on, we sound like 16-year-olds! Who cares? Let's fire our last rounds. Okay. What's the prize? Him, all of him! Hey! We look like lesbians. - Why did we come? - For the bet. What a whore. Isn't she a model? Not her, Marco. Look how he struts, like he's got the only one. He tries to seduce them all: ugly, pretty, young or old. - Are you giving up? - No, dear. He promises it to everyone, but doesn't give it to anyone. Here I go, look and learn. Wait, Beba. - Why don't we leave? - What's the matter? I'm not having fun. Marco irritates me, who knows why. Come on, let's go. Please, ten minutes and then we'll leave. You stay. See you at home. What an idiot... Coming! Roberta, I hate you when you do this! Oh, God. I prefer the before look. - Would you like to come in? - Yeah. - The exhibition? - The inauguration's over. And Beba? Where did she end up? She went to a party, I don't know with whom. Please, sit down. Thank you. Why are you here? I heard about the bet! Roberta told me everything. She can't keep things for more than five minutes, she likes to share. She also said you gave up the bet, I came to ask you why. It was a stupid bet. Why did you stop playing? Maybe because I didn't like you enough. - Nice of you. - You came to hear it. Maybe you don't like me as a photographer. Maybe you don't like me as a person. This is so embarrassing. I have no romantic interest in you. You do, just by refusing me. I'm sleepy, I'd like to go to bed. Kicking me out? No, stay if you like, but I'm going to bed. Okay. I'll let you sleep. Let's be friends at least. - Sure. - So I can ask you out. Not a date, no candlelight dinner. Tomorrow I'm taking special shots. - What do you mean? - You'll find out only if you come. If I had the nerve, I'd steal that notebook. I'd love to know what he writes! Isn't stealing his soul enough? Don't give me a moral lecture. Stealing souls is my job. No, good heavens... But I'd say you're taking advantage of his grief. I hate being photographed without my knowledge. I just want to tell his story. Tell me, what have your pictures discovered? Could they stop him from suffering? Could they stop his obsessive writing? And about what? Maybe he's writing about you! About this asshole who's been tailing him for two months. What kind of relationship is this? He gives you the chance to express yourself. What do you give him? What the fuck do you give him? Don't try it on! Adriana? "I licked you all over last night... How beautiful, how crazy..." I wrote it down, but you know the building. The doctor's name, the date, the time... here. Do you understand? Quiet, I don't want him to see me. - Why did we come then? - There he is! Well? He has a tattooed eyebrow, he's big, he's a tan, he must be 20... what's he to you? Nothing... that's why I need therapy, this has never happened before! I order groceries every day, just to see him, I offered him coffee once, his name's Vasco... You can't be in love, it must be a hormonal hiatus! I want him to see me. Sorry. - Elena, wait... - He didn't even say hello. - He didn't see me. - We ran right into him! You were there, he didn't want to lose face, he's shy. Shy. Can we go back? No, no, you make yourself look ridiculous. - You think so? - I do. I can't imagine you helping me, the snow queen! How long's it been since you fell in love or had an affair? Desire, zero! I might be crazy but you're no joke either. Who says I'm not the object of desire? Okay, read this, I didn't want to show you but you're forcing me. Who licks you all over? Who picked you up? It didn't happen for real, it's a dream. Who dreamed about you? A man... I met at coffee bar. He smokes cigars. Cigars are phallic, interesting! But he's older than me, I've never had affairs with older men. In the days when you had affairs! But I like this guy, I think about him... I even went back to the place to see him... Nothing. Call him. Love to! I don't have his number. But he sent you a text message! He has my number, I don't have his. You have to come with me to the shrink. SORRY ABOUT THE TEXT... I REALLY DREAMED OF YOU LIKE THAT... I'M LONELY! BRING ME SOMETHING TO EAT? You came! If I'm here... - Won't you let me in? - Sure, come in. What a nice house! I love mortadella! - Yes, it's good. - Delicious. I brought grapes too. Thank you. Have some. It's for you, have some. Yeah? I told you, I'm better, I'll call you later. Okay, bye. Luca, the guy I was talking to on your scooter. Just today he's called me 80 times. - You love each other, huh? - To death! Come here. I've too much to think about, I have no time to waste. I want to go to Cuba to my brother Giorgio. So cool, he's a photographer and is crazier than me. Do you know photographers? No, not really. Cartier Bresson! - You know him? He's my favourite. - Of course. Dad and me. Nice, isn't it? Very. If it's Luca I'll tell him to fuck off. Dad? Mum's not here, when are you coming? Come on! So we can call Giorgio on Skype! I'll show you how. Okay, I'm waiting. Bye. That was Dad, he's coming. - Then I'll leave. - Stay, I'll introduce you! What? I just brought you something to eat. - Do you have Skype? - Sure, what do you think? It's not a coincidence. Since that day, I've come here three times just to bump into you. I was just passing by. - I won't bother you. - No! No! I'm glad to see you. I saw Adriana again too. - How is she? - Just fine. Are you going to work now? I'm going home. I work from home for a publishing company, I read manuscripts, correct files, I'm like the editor if they decide to publish the book. What do you do? I'm going to the beach now. The beach? It's not the season. I don't go to swim. Want to come? We'll buy something and eat it on the beach. Do you like this music? Want the truth? Not very much. You're right, they're still a little raw, but I'm working on it. Are you in the music field? Yes, I'm a producer. The only thing I like. Besides you. Great! Come here. My recording company won't touch these kids, but I believe in them, I feel they've got something, and when I believe in something, I hang on. Do you mind if I smoke? You're crying? I'm happy you're going to live with Marco, but... it's like the end of an era. - This one? - Horrors. Please, throw them all out and start over. You sound like Marco, he criticizes me a lot too. He does? Oh, great! You've been together for two months and he's already a pain. He'll take care of me, he treats me like a child. What a pain! He's a good screw at least? I still don't know. You don't? And this? Stay on the subject. You don't... We still haven't done it. And you're moving in? Why? You know what he's like, appearances count... Could that be an excuse? No. Have you touched it? No... I mean, yes. - Does he have a small one? - Beba, I don't know! - I don't think so. - You don't think so? Holy Mary! Roberta, our love is romantic. Marco shows me reality from another angle, maybe because, being a photographer, he catches what's behind the image. Maybe what's in front counts too. And tonight will be our first night. - Great! - Don't be so stupid! You have to get ready. Should you wear something sexy or romantic? Take this. If you don't see anything, come back to live with me. More candles? It's like a wake! Just a little atmosphere. It looks like a photography shoot. It is, a little. Put those candles down and come here. You're beautiful. I want to look at you. I want you to strip for me. I'm not up for it. I'll put some music on. I can't do it, I'm sorry. - Do it for me. - I just can't, you do it! But then you'll do it for me too. Okay, start. What so funny? Sorry, I was thinking about Roberta... I strip for you and you think about Roberta? My love, forgive me, I have to tell her I won't need her magnifying glass. - Magnifying glass? - Forget it. - What? - Nothing, my love. But now it's your turn. - Adriana? - Connect on Skype, it's important. Let's connect on Skype... It took you ages! I connected fast! - Can you see me good? - Yes. Now don't talk, I'll show you Luca, he doesn't know you're watching, don't let him catch you. Luca. Come here! What's with you today? You're slower than usual. Did I say to sit? No, stand up. Get off my case, it's not a good time. Don't you want to play? Get out. - What are we doing? - Show us your great butt. But let's make it fast. It always takes you two minutes, you won't be late! Today you won't see me... you'll just imagine. PEOPLE'S BANK OF BARI What is it? Oh? Can't you call your little boyfriend? Okay, I'm coming. Well? What has upset you? Nothing, what do you think happened? I don't know, you made me run! I was feeling lonely. Want a pudding? There's just one... Want to split it? - Yes. - I'm a little mad at you. Why did you shut your computer in my face? Not in your face, but on other parts of the body, and not yours! What were you thinking? I just wanted to show you Luca. Luca? In the buff? What a prig you are! Did you see what a nice butt? You can never be serious. I don't understand you! It's no fun for you if you don't understand? I'd really like to know what you think of Luca. What do I think of Luca? He's cute, but he's not my type, too young. You don't have to screw him! Who said that? You're one-track! But I think he's a little hick for you. You're a racist, you discriminate against people! I adore differences, I love them! Excuse me. Beba, what is it? You lost it? I wrote it on a slip of paper! I don't remember the address, but it's that big building, we always walk by it, near the port, a snack bar... there's a plaque outside. Not Galbati, Dr. Galbiati. That, at least, I can remember. Alright, please remember to let me know. Bye, hugs. Sorry. What's your connection to that bitch? At least, do you know who Dr. Galbiati is? She stole my father and left me without a family. Why the fuck are you seeing her? To know yourself better? Why are you seeing that whore? It's not for me, it's for Roberta, a friend of mine. I knew I shouldn't have trusted you. She's turned me into a bitch like herself. She's turned me... If you were a bitch, I wouldn't have come to see you. And why do you? Why do you come to see me? I don't know. We barely know each other. Maybe you're more wretched than me. - I'm not. - You hate men too. I don't hate anyone, sorry to contradict you, actually... Maybe you say that because your father dumped you, that's why you treat Luca so bad. Luca deserves it. I like him the way he is: a hick, clumsy, stupid. He doesn't even know how to kiss. When he kisses me his mouth is closed tight, I can't get to his tongue, I just feel his teeth. He does this... When he kisses, his face is gloomy, he does this... I'll make you laugh, come on! He kisses in bits, like this. Adriana... I've told him a thousand times he should do it like this... I've wanted to kiss you since I first saw you. Stop, not like that. Want to tell me how? What are we doing... - Hello? - Know why I'm calling? Do I need riddles? Adriana, I have no time, what is it? Because I'm horny. I was thinking about you and touched myself, but I didn't want to do it alone... Turn on the speaker. Why should I? You need both hands free. Please, just do what I ask for once! For once? So far, we've done everything you wanted. Are you scared to play a little? It won't hurt. Haven't you ever done it? Of course I have... but alone, we do these things alone. Or you'll get locked up? - Where are you? - In my lounge chair. Lie down. Move you're panties aside, touch yourself. - Do it with both hands. - What? Let's do it together. Please, I'm already doing it. I can't, I'm sorry, you seem crazy. Be quiet, let me talk. I want to be inside you. Do this at least... do what I ask you. What should I do? Take the phone. Take it. Rub it between your thighs. Are you doing it? Yes. Touch yourself with it, I want my voice to go inside you, I want to talk inside you. Can you feel me? Can you feel me inside you? Feel how beautiful it is... we're together, my love. Together... Adriana? Why are you crying? What's the matter? Answer me? Why are you crying? Silly, I wasn't crying... I was coming. You just can't do it. You're right, I can't do it. - Our house was better. - You're crazy. Did I tell you Marco set up an interview with a publishing house? I'll be a proofreader, the money's not bad. He even decides what work I do, understand? I wouldn't worry about a man who finds work for me. What's more, he's super cool, he hasn't got a small one, on the contrary... What's he like in bed? He's caring, tender... a little fast! He always leaves the light on and... he's a little strange, he doesn't want me to touch him. Oh, he's good alright, like he's doing homework, he does it well, but there's... As we make love, it's like he's watching himself making love to me, understand? As we make love, he observes, it's like he watches himself as he makes love to me. I'm crazy. Honey, you haven't married him. You can come back to me, I haven't replaced you. What? No, I'm crazy about him, he's perfect. It's just that... we always do so many things, and then... he asked me for a child. Already? He asked about my ovulation. - And you? - Me, what? - What did you say? - Not the truth, of course. Good, living with me has done you good! Don't wait up for me, those people like the wee hours. It's the third time this week. You know what it means to get an exclusive contract at the magazine? You always said you wanted to be free. I've changed my mind this time. And we can use the money when we start our family. Do fashion magazines always have dinner meetings? They're American and be leaving in a few days, I take them around... What's it cost me? Don't think I'm having fun. You know what I'd like to be? - A fly. - A fly? A fly. To see how you behave when you're not with me, what you do, the act you do... - What act? - The act... We'll do like this: as soon as they go, you'll never be alone. Hello? Did you get there? Yes, I'm having dinner. Is everything okay? I wanted to hear your voice. I can't talk now. How many of you? Five, why? I miss you, you know? I can't talk, I'm with business people, you know that. Hello? Elena, are you there? Yes, I'm here. Can I sit a while with you two? Just want a glass of wine. I just got a terrible thirst. Thank you. Waiter, could you bring a glass? - Shall I set a place? - No, I don't want to disturb. It's an intimate dinner, you know? Thank you. Well? Won't you introduce your friend? My name's Rocco. A pleasure. Elena. - You're not from here. - No, Milan, I'm here for work. - You're a model, aren't you? - Yes. Elena, I can explain. What? It all seems so clear. Let's not ruin the evening. Thank you. Don't you want to know who I am? You're a friend of his? What am I, Marco? We can talk about it outside. No, stay, I'm leaving. Let's have a toast, just one toast, okay? Let's see... what can we toast to? To loves that are ending? To loves that are starting? I'm trite. Let's toast to change. To change. A little more. That's better, much better. What are you doing? Stay, please. No need to show me out. Goodbye, Rocco. Or maybe not. Nothing needs to be done and the rent's low. And this? This... is my gift to you. Too heavy to get rid of. You've taken the apartment, right? Without waiting for me to see it! It was a good deal! You keep taking care of me, you won't let go. Want to go live with Roberta? No, I want you to let go of me. Why did you call me back? Think it's easy for me? Don't you see? You were my Prince Charming, but you turned the love into an ambiguous doubt. Elena... - If you want, we can... - No. Marco, we can't. I feel sick, where's the bathroom? - Where is it? - First on the right. Elena! - Is everything alright? - Close the door! So? - Beba! - Shit. What do I do now? It's going to be alright. What do I do now? This is the most beautiful gift in the world. I can't believe it. Can you imagine it, my love? "My love"? You said "my love"? How the fuck dare you? Elena, I really loved you. This child is a beautiful gift. - Don't you desire to be a mother? - No. No I don't, I never have, I don't feel ready, and besides it's crazy to have a child of yours! Do it for me. I'll take care of all your needs. I'll take the baby, please. I'll keep him. Elena, please. Ettore? - What a surprise! - You didn't expect it? No, not after a month. I was in Paris on business, I just got back. You're the only person I'd like to see. If I drop by in an hour... How about my place instead? I make a great spaghetti and eggplant dish. Give me the address. I'll text it to you. Okay. An hour? What can I do? Damn, he's already here? You just couldn't wait to see me! Hi, baby, the party's here! - What are you doing here? - I followed you... Who gave you my address? ...when you left my house. I never use my old scooter, but I had to know where you lived. Don't make that face, haven't you ever followed anyone? No, actually I haven't. You're not curious about others, I want to know everything. This is called intrusion. Old-fashioned! Let yourself go. Adriana, sorry but... I'm not a lesbian. There's nothing wrong with it but I'm not lesbian. Me neither! It was the first time for me too, and so? But you liked it that time. Yes, I liked it, but I've never thought about it, I don't see why you... You don't have fun if you don't understand, it's opposite for me. What's so funny? I'm thinking about my dad. If he saw me with you he'd think I have an unresolved Electra complex! You're thinking about your father, I'm thinking about Marco. What a laugh if he could see me? Who's Marco? Forget it, that's another whole story... Anyway it's absurd, I don't know what got into me. Me, I got into you. Adriana... stop, I'm waiting for someone... Oh, God, the eggplant! So, Ettore and you became friends. Yes. Do you screw with him? You're vulgar, and it's none of your business. - You're free to do what you want. - Thanks! Only if you do it with me later. Don't worry, I'll behave this evening. No one's invited you. Too late. Keep an eye on the eggplant. Too soon? No. Thank you, they're beautiful. I'll take your jacket. And for me? No flowers? - I didn't know you were here. - She's leaving. You're so handsome, you look younger! Come here. Is that a compliment? May I smoke? Only if you open the window. - Those things stink... - Perfume for me. How come only men smoke cigars? Does it remind you of when you played with your dick? - Adriana! - Let her talk. Another line like that and I'll stop smoking. Do you play the piano? No, it was already here. It's out-of-tune. Why don't you play something? Come on, don't make us beg! Any requests? No. Sit down, let's pretend we're at a concert. When he's done, I'll leave. You want to be alone with him. You're wrong. - You're aroused, I feel it. - Stop it. - I'll get you ready, he can't see. - Stop it. It's too out-of-tune, I think I'll go. Wait, at least have a drink. I drove all day, I'm exhausted. We could give you a massage. If you explain the game rules to me, maybe I'd like to play too. How old are you? Why? - How old are you? - 50. At 50 you challenge a kid? Don't fuck me around, I want to keep liking you. Adriana, cut it out. Ettore, the next time you call me... You could call me too. I ruined your evening, didn't I? You'd rather I'd have gone. Shut up. Ettore! Come on, stop! Please. You know why I didn't call for a month? I don't want an affair. Or at least I thought so. I thought it was a screw with a beautiful unknown woman, a very beautiful screw. But even a screw is an affair, isn't it? Inside it there are... emotions, even if it all ends there. Then... you want to know one another better because... I don't know why. Take me away. Now? Where do you want to go? I doesn't matter... Take me away. I'll pick you up in two days, we'll go away for the whole weekend. Where? Adriana? Adriana? I'm sorry. Now I'll deserve your forgiveness. Stop. I don't want this anymore. Adriana, no more. Look at us. See how beautiful we are. Not so angry, let her breathe, it's a love song. - But it gets too sweet. - Listen. It's the force of passion, it has to be overwhelming. Right, but it's a love song, I want to hear love, with tenderness... go. Love with tenderness, what do you say? I don't know... I know I'm not giving up anything anymore. But love... I'm not making it up anymore, I'll take what comes, even without knowing what it is. Who scared you? No one... I do it all by myself! - I like them, they're good. - Think so? I want more. We have to hurry, the concert starts in half an hour. I need a shower. What are you doing? Hush. Stay still. That's enough, get dressed. Go. Don't wash, I want to smell your scent. Take me home, please! Take me home, please! I'd like to come up and sleep with you. If we hadn't raced out, we'd have slept together. I just want to sleep. No, please! Do you know what time it is? I fell asleep like an idiot. Your mother will be worried. My mother's not there, don't worry. Ettore. I've ruined another evening. Evening? You've ruined a dawn. Oh, God... I have to talk to you. But not in front of him. - I'll make coffee. - Good. I have to make a decision. My folks are paying for a trip to Cuba, it's the right time for an experience like that and I want to go. Nice. Wonderful, I'm happy for you. How do I fit in here? What? I'm leaving right when our affair is starting. What affair? What a bitch. I don't want to leave you. If you tell me not to go, I'll stay here! You have to go. Never give up anything, least of all, for me. But if I go, you'll forget me. No. I don't care if you take up with Ettore, I'm not jealous. Maybe just leave... a tiny space for me. Tiny... She fell asleep. You'll have to make do on the couch. By now, sleep... Thank you. I have three children. They live in Paris with their mother. I manage to see them only in summer. They have... another father, a real father, more present. When I left my wife, I left my children too. Come here. I have a daughter too, her name's Claudia. When she was born, I left her with him, her father, and I don't even know what she's like! If she knows about me, if she hates me, I couldn't bring myself to see her. I just couldn't... I'm here with you. Together we will. - Want me to go with you? - No, I have to go alone. Elena! You can always change your mind. Hello, please come in. Hi, Elena. Hi, Marco. You're as ugly as ever. You too. How are you? Fine. We're fine. I'm sorry, it's not easy. I know. But we'll help you. We'll take it slow. Would you like something to drink? Want to see her? Come with me. Call her. Claudia! She's so beautiful... She's so beautiful! What are you preparing for me? I'm creating. I'm hungry. Cuba calling Italy, do you hear me? If I don't do the calling... Show me your belly. It's stupendous. It's a little scary. - How are you? - Out of my mind. But I'm fed up, be back on Thursday. - Are you still waiting for me? - I am... We all are. How's Ettore? Fine. He's cooking. Good for you, you've made him a slave, I like that. Dumbbell, we take turns. Do you still remember the dream I had with you? Yes, I do. Then I really want to come back. I love you. Me too, a lot. What's Adriana up to? She's coming back. LOVE IS NOT PERFECT
