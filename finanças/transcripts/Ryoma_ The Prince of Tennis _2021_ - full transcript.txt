Hello, and welcome to all who came to the theater. This is the Seishun Academy Tennis Club captain, Kunimitsu Tezuka. The following movie has two different versions. "Decide" and "Glory." What you're about to watch is the "Decide" version. Additionally, there is a special feature at the end called, "Decide, Theater Tenifes Petit." Please watch and enjoy the film all the way to the end. Without further ado, now don't let your guard down. Tennis. Do you think it's fun? Don't get too impressed by me, kid. Plenty of guys are stronger. For example, there was one person at the US Open, he made me retire. That ball's from that very match, by the way. Don't waste your summer. Embrace your youth and do stuff. Fresh watermelon. No bad, huh? Just came up with it. Is Sakuno still shopping? We're going to be late for the Chinese theater. Just give her a minute. We rarely get to travel like this, so she should have some time to enjoy herself. What's she looking for anyway? I bet it's a gift for Ryoma. Wait, Ryoma? What is he, her boyfriend? Something like that. Ah. It's adorable. Mmmm. This one's perfect. Excuse me, I'd like to buy this. Thank you, sir. Couldn't help but wonder, are you from Japan? Great country. I love all the food. Like tempura, sushi... What else? Hello. Uh, miss? Dumbass! Get out of the street! What, you got a death wish or something? Is that Ryoma? Wait, come back. Whoa, sorry about that. That was quite the bump. - You all right, Miss? - Uh-huh. - You're not hurt? - No. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Hey, boys, we got a little tennis fan over here. Oh no. This doesn't look good. What have I gotten myself into? Well, what we play around these parts kinda has some special rules. We call it "Gamble Tennis." Gamble Tennis? The player who loses... Has to pay the winner a thousand dollars. Wait, how much? How many zeros are there? 10, hundred, thousand. Are we doing this or what? Got me right in the ear, man! Huh? Can you not? That's pretty clich√©. So it was you. I knew I saw you back there, Ryoma. What're you doing in the US? Now isn't the best time for small talk. What the hell? Hey, kid! What, is she your cute girlfriend or something? My cute girlfriend, he says. I'm talking to you! You play? The sport of tennis, I mean. What gave it away? Let's play something special then, a little Gamble Tennis. But, heads up, whoever loses pays two thousand dollars. But you said it was one thousand. No. You're allowed to chicken out if you're not up for it. Wouldn't want you to go bankrupt. You're on. Let's do this with tennis. Looks like I win. Let's try this the old fashioned way! Now do what I tell you, hear me? Or else your girl is gonna get it! What's going on? Ryuzaki! Huh? - Ryoma. - I'm right here. Are you okay? Yeah. Wait, where'd those guys go? They're gone. Huh? What happened to the court here? Weren't the walls covered in graffiti before? But now, I don't get how they got completely clean all of a sudden. I wonder, those guys couldn't have taken us somewhere else that's similar, could they? Oh! Oh, I forgot that my parents are waiting for me! Ryoma, I'm sorry but I gotta hurry back to the market! Mom, Dad, where are you? Ryoma! They're gone! I don't know how but I can't find them anywhere. - Ryuzaki. - Huh? Hear me out on this. But we might have gone back in time. Is that possible? Look at this poster. There's my dad. - Huh? - It's from when he was a pro, playing in the US Open. Well it does say "Nanjiro," so you're right. Do you know why? When I was here earlier today, this poster wasn't hanging up. Plus, the thing looks like it's brand new. So that would explain why those courts were different. We did go back in time and your dad's here. The US Open, where my dad was forced to retire for some reason. His opponent's name is Weasley Vaughan. "Serves a powerful skyscraper serve using his height." What? I've done so much research on this match. But somehow I've never seen his name before. Why wasn't Weasley Vaughan's name recorded in history? What are we supposed to do now and how do we go back? Is it even possible to return to our own time? Might as well go off what we know. So if we did travel to the past, my old house should still be where I remember. Come on. Yeah, right behind you. Weasley Vaughan, huh? Wonder what kind of player he is. Maybe I can find a way to see that match and get a chance to see Dad play in his prime. Car's not there. They must be out right now. Did you actually live here when you were little? - Pretty sure. - Pretty sure? Got it. And now I'm positive. Hey, you can't just go in there without permission. Why not? It is my house. Still feels weird. Wow, your place is huge. Yeah, really takes me back. But it feels a little less huge than I remember. They've got family pictures. Hey, is this kid you? You're so tiny. It'll only take a second. Just gotta grab something. What the? Oh, Rinko, did you forget to lock the door? Don't look at me, you were the last one out. Fine, I suppose I... Please forgive us! We're sorry we broke into your house. All right, explain this. Sure! We were passing by and... Can you help me out? Wait. Are you my...? You're fans of mine! - Okay. - Well, neat. Should've told me from the get-go. Still, you can't let yourselves into other people's houses like that. Of course, we understand. That's him all right. He's as dense as always. Hey, Nanjiro, what's taking you so long in there? Sorry, honey, just burglars. Uh... Oh, I have an idea. I'm about to go do some training. You wanna tag along? For real? So is that a yes then? One condition, you are not allowed to break into my house anymore. Huh? Hmm. Now, Ryoma, how old are you? Whoa, hold on, how do you know baby bro's name already? Um, it's 'cause earlier we saw your family picture, right? Uh-huh. That reminds me, mind if we all go around and introduce ourselves? Of course, I'm Sakuno Ryuzaki. And I'm Ryoma. Huh? Just like baby bro's name. True but we can explain. Well, not that unusual for multiple people to have the same name. What a happy little coincidence. You're right, coincidence. Feel free to go on ahead. I'll park the car. Gotcha. Greetings, Mr. Nanjiro. Huh? My congrats on reaching the final round. Uh, thank you. And you are? He's the president of A&A! You know, the tournament sponsor! And you better not forget that! Please, I'm so sorry for his outburst. You see, he can have quite the temper. Oh, silly me, where are my manners? This young man is Chris Burkman. He recently became a professional. And he's an extraordinarily promising player. Cool. Nice to meet you. You're the famous Samurai Nanjiro guy? Don't know how you swindled your way to the finals but news flash, pal, there's no way you're gonna win against Vaughan. Somebody like you can't just barge onto our turf and take the US Open from us! Try to control yourself, won't you, Christopher? Hey, you know what, I've got an idea. Why don't the two of you get on the court and rally to let bygones be bygones? He wants them to play each other? Of course, you have that big final match coming up. No pressure but the offer is there. Sounds good to me. I came here to train anyway, so it works out. You wanna play tennis, show me what you got. Awesome. I'll get to see my dad play in his prime after all. Oh, wow. I see it, you're so much like your dad. So, what'd you think? Blown away, right? I'm gonna be upfront with you. How the heck did you get so good? Huh? Like my secret sauce or something? Well, I could tell you but then I'd have to kill you. The secret to my strength is kinda complicated. To put it simply, try to be patient, you'll understand it when you're older. Wow, some answer. Where do you think you're taking her? - Put her down! - Get off me! Rinko! Ryuzaki! Damn! Mom, hang on, please wake up! Ryuzaki! Move it! Rinko, are you okay? Hurry! Your little girlfriend's coming with us. The ball... Bastard! You'll pay for that! Dang it! They got away. But why kidnap Ryuzaki? Probably because they thought she was my daughter. How do you know? This was on the knife they threw at us. "Mr. Echizen, "we have your daughter. "Call the police and the girl will be dead." You're kidding me! They're using her as a hostage? Sounds like it. "Act normal until the US Open Finals. "We'll contact you again." Hang on... "Victory for the future. "Victory for the great America." What does this last part here even mean? Points out their target. Someone's after me. Probably won't be happy if I win the US Open. Who could that be? Not sure. For the time being, we should do as they say and lay low. That way, she won't be put in any further danger while we figure this out. Come on, Ryoma. Stay at my place tonight. We'll think about how to fix this and get her back. It's all my fault. Ryuzaki got caught up in this mess because of me. Now what? Selly's Bar? He's gonna use up all the hot water. Wait a second! That boy's a moron. Okay. Huh? Huh? Wha...? Hey, little boy, you sure you're in the right bar? They don't serve warm milk in a place like this. - What the? - Huh? Bro, look! What's the matter with you? Keep it down. There he is! There who is? Use your words. Ah, there he is! I don't wanna hear it, old man! All that for some random Japanese girl. - Huh? - Huh? My men have better things to do, so don't use them for pointless jobs like this. Listen, I'm not gonna tell you this again. Stop wasting my time and leave us out of your business. What? Don't make me repeat myself. Drop the whole loving father act already! I'm tired of hearing that crap! Hey, kid, get back here! Don't you have any manners? Would you keep it down? - But this kid barged in... - I told you to shut up! You got it. We're shutting up, Emerald. Who are you supposed to be? Where's Ryuzaki? I asked who you are, so answer that first. I'm Ryoma Echizen... and that Japanese girl your goons kidnapped before isn't Nanjiro Echizen's daughter at all. - Huh? - Wait, Nanjiro Echizen? I know, that's Samurai Nanjiro. A quick head's up, he doesn't have any daughters. He only has a son and that's me. You said your father is Samurai Nanjiro? Now you get it. You'd better exchange her for me right away if you know what's good for you. Yeah? So, what's your relationship to this girl anyway? She's just my classmate, so yeah. Right, I'm sure that's all she is. - You three! - Yes, ma'am! You know that job the old man assigned to you? Tell me about the client. Well, you see that's actually kinda the... Kinda what? - They're from New York! - Huh? We heard that this client's from New York City. But that's all, we don't know their name. New York, huh? Yes. Hey, where you keeping the girl? What? Just spit it out already. In the usual warehouse. Hey, are we doing this exchange or not? I'm waiting. You wanna be the hostage instead? I do. And don't make me repeat myself. I like your style, kiddo. Those eyes are exhilarating and that look is thrilling. I'll show you the way. Sorry, Dad. Sorry, Mom. Please, Ryoma. Ryuzaki! You found me. I'm here, you okay? Get your hands off of her! That little girl still belongs to us. Does she? That isn't what we agreed to. Sorry, but I don't remember making any specific agreements. Don't you though? The only thing I said is that I liked your style. And I said I was gonna be your hostage in her place. - Huh? - So shouldn't that be enough? You actually... You think that's enough? Listen up, I brought you here, so you're in no position to make demands. You should be grateful, if anything. You owe me. Tell me what you want. That's better. You've got a grip sticking out of your backpack. That's a tennis racket, right? Do you play or is that just your weapon of choice? You should know that rackets aren't meant to hurt other people. Ha. A certain somebody I know said that. Obviously, I carry it with me so I can play tennis whenever. Nice. Funny enough, I actually play a bit of tennis myself. Do it! Yes, ma'am. Better get ready 'cause we're gonna have a little showdown. You wanna play a match against me, right here? Uh-huh, right here. A tennis court? It's the same court that I've been using since I was a kid. We'll play a one set match and if you're able to win, then I'll grant the two of you your freedom. Hang on, you're gonna do what? The big boss might not like... If you lose our little match, then I'll hand you both to the old man in charge. Sound like a good deal to you? Ryoma. Ryuzaki. You mind waiting here for a sec? That's all I can do. Ha. I guess you're on. The mafia's going down. Those exhilarating eyes again. I hope you're ready for this. Hey! What's going on? - Do something! - Yes, ma'am! Yes, ma'am. I said, what's going on? Who's there? Hey, Ryoma, behind you. Da... I mean, what're you doing here? We can talk later. Let's go while the going's good. Time to leave. You said it. - We're out of here. - Yeah we are. - Get up, Wolf! - Yeah. - Boo! - Yeah. - Foo! - Yeah. Make yourselves useful. Don't let those brats get away. Or else, you hear me? Find them and bring them back here! - Especially that boy. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - Get going! - Right away! Hold your horses, fellas! Where are we going? We're looking for him! Wouldn't it make more sense for us to go in different directions, huh? Why don't we just split up? - What? - Huh? Boys! Search like it's the last thing you do! If we don't find them, it'll be on our asses! You don't want that! You really don't want that. Oh, what am I supposed to tell the big boss if we screw this up? Come on, Wolf Man. You all right, those guys didn't hurt you? Yeah, I'm okay. We were in big trouble, thank you for saving us. How did you know where to find her? Selly's Bar, ring a bell? It was the only lead we had, so I followed it. That's fair. Then you noticed it too. Why didn't you tell me about this earlier? Well, I would've if I had known that you'd randomly sneak out in mid shower. Also, don't leave the water running for so long. Rinko's not happy about it. All right, let's go. Go where exactly? Home, obviously. I don't think that's the best idea. They know where you live, right? If you went back there, they're probably gonna be waiting for you. Hang on, why are they after us? What's the point? Sticking to their threat. They threatened you? That's the whole reason why they kidnapped you in the first place. They thought you were my daughter. Pretty clear what their motives are. They think they can take my kid and force me to throw the finals of the US Open. If they kidnap them, that'd be blackmail. Mm-hmm. And that means Ryoma and Ryoga are both in danger, aren't they? - It's okay. - Huh? Don't worry about that. I told them that I was your only son. They bought it, so your kids are safe. But they're after us now. Makes me wonder, did Dad have to retire because of this? They fixed his final match? We'll make it out of here and be on the run for two days, just until the finals happen. This won't be how you go out. Don't let them force you to place a rigged match. Give it everything you've got and take the US Open title. You sure about this? Can you protect her on your own? I will, no matter what. All right, fine. But find a way to contact me tomorrow and let me know that you two are okay. You have to promise me that. Got it? Then after these next two days, I wanna make sure that you're safe and sound. So come to the tournament and you can watch me win right in front of you. Mm. - Come on, let's leave. - Uh-huh. You can exit from the back door. Sure, got it. Get going. - Hey. - Huh? When this all works out and we get away, and you win the finals, what comes next? Actually, forget it. We're out of here, follow me. We'll see you at the match. Yeah. Samurai Nanjiro's kid is something else. He accepted my challenge and I have a feeling he'll stay true to his word. There they are! I saw the little brat and his girlfriend go down that alley! Can you keep up, you good? Yeah. I'll manage. Get back here! Ryoma, what do we do now? He's catching up! Turn left up there. Keep going! Huh? Take the next right. Get moving. It's this way! Foo, follow them! Stay behind me. Don't do this. I'll be fine. Huh? Hey, cut that out, you bastard, that hurts! Get out of there! Gotcha. That's mine. Come here! Ryuzaki! Uh-uh. Better not try anything unless you want her to slip. I said, don't try anything so just stop running and do what we tell you. Huh? Give it back. Sure. Ryuzaki! You're okay. Yeah. Sorry, Ryoma. What's wrong with you? Jumping off a building for a bag? - Hey. - Huh? It's a long way down, so better hang in there, buddy. - Don't get smart with me! - See ya. Not "see ya"! Get back here! What'd I tell you? I ordered you to find them! How difficult could that be? Pretty hard. I don't want your excuses! Listen, bring them here before tomorrow night, whatever the cost. And don't you dare tell my old man. Got it? There's no way. Big boss can't even know, so what do I do? Could always just cut and run. Huh? Thanks. We appreciate the help. Oh! You're full of surprises, Ryoma. You even know how to hitchhike. It's not a big deal. Anyway, let's hunker down in there for the rest of the night. - Hiding in a church? - Yup. I highly doubt they're gonna search a place like this. It's those two kids. Ha. You should probably use that. Huh? For your braid. Thanks, I will. Sorry. I mean, I know this is scary and... Is something wrong? What's the matter? It's nothing, just forget it. Well, actually... Ryuzaki, I promise you. It's pretty nice out. Awesome. Let's start heading toward the stadium today. After all, we have a... Morning there, you little pain in my ass. Let Ryuzaki go. The one you want is me, right? No, both of you. Now come quietly and I promise the girl won't get hurt. All right, kid, you're driving, so get over there. Wait, why me? I don't know how to drive a car. I'm 12, dude. - Huh? - Mm-mmm. Listen here! I don't want any funny business, got it? Nothing funny, got it. I can see what you're doing back there! No sudden movements, kid! What's his problem? He's pretty on edge. That lady in the photo, isn't she your boss? Huh? She was invincible back in the day. Nobody could beat her, and I mean nobody. Really? Then why did she quit? It's none of your business! Stop it! Ryuzaki! Wake up! Are you okay? Talk to me! - Yeah. - Good. Hang tight. Here, grab onto my shoulder. Your legs aren't hurt, are they? Can you walk? No, they're fine. And yeah, I can walk. You got a ways to go. Okay, we're out. Gotta hide somewhere for the day. Mmm. Hey, Ryoma, can we take a moment to rest? Oh. Right. A bus stop. We can squat there. Oh. I've gotta call my dad anyway. Oh, can you hear me? Hello? I recognize that voice. Huh? What's happening? Is this Yukimura? I'm surprised to hear from you. How did you get my number, exactly? Uh... Well, that doesn't matter. It's fine. Honestly, thanks for calling. Now then, what can I do for you? I don't know... To give you an update, I'm in America right now. Is that so? Sounds fun. However, despite your travels, you don't seem excited about it. - What's wrong? - Huh? Are you okay? Is there anything I can help you with? - Hey, Ryoma. - Huh? That guy, he's here, look. Hello? Are you there? Hm. Why'd it call Yukimura in the future? - Huh? - Ryuzaki, you mind if I try and make another phone call? Hey, it's me. Is that who I think it is? Hello, Echizen. Huh? Wait, Captain? What would you do if this were a tennis match? Echizen! When your back is against the wall, how do you play in order to pull through? Huh? No matter the cost, you have to come back. Don't let your guard down. Ryoma, what're you doing up there? Uh! Huh? Get down before he notices you! Hey! That freaking runt! I told you. What do we do? Where are you doing? That's the wrong way. Well there he goes. So what do I do? What, you wanna throw down? Great, you're here. Hey, stay still and stop dodging! Pathetic. We're the mafia. We can't be humiliated like that. I'm gonna have to whip you punks into shape. Stay there and don't you dodge. Oh, the balls! My balls. Well, at least you didn't try to dodge. - Boss! - Hm? You're back. And you caught them? Not exactly. These two came willingly. Wait, willingly? Hmm. Why don't you tell me what changed your mind? I'm tired of running away. That's it? Expecting something more? It's just no fun. When your back is against the wall, how do you play in order to pull through? I won't keep running and staying on the defensive. I'll face you head on and win. That's the way I like to play. Those eyes are exhilarating. You want me to show you what I can really do? - You okay, boss? - Boss! Shut up, I'm fine! I had no idea that you were left-handed. What now? Wanna keep going? You beat me, kid. It's your win. Samurai Junior sure knows what he's doing. Thanks. So, since you lost to me and all, I got a favor to ask you. Hmm? Welcome, everyone! Now, ladies and gentlemen, a word from the president of A&A Sports. The sponsor of this tournament, Mr. Adam Anderson. To every spectator joining us today, I'd like to thank each one of you for attending. I'm so honored to share this moment with such supporters. I hope all of you in the stands, as well as those watching from home, are prepared for this extraordinary occasion that will truly be one for the ages. The finale of this tournament marks the legendary moment in history where the new hero of the tennis world will be born. Let us all witness that moment together! Victory for the great America, right? That future won't turn out how you think. Go Vaughan! Go Vaughan! Go Vaughan! Go Vaughan! Go Vaughan! Any updates? Did he call yet? Oh, of course. Hey, Nanjiro! Let's give it our best to try and have a great match. Well, we both know that only one of us can actually play for real today. I'm about to teach you a lesson that you're never gonna forget. Ha. Huh? Go Vaughan! Go Vaughan! Go Vaughan! The best-of-five set match. Vaughan to serve. Play. Hmm. Damn him. Just who does he think he is? I don't like that expression that he made. Baker's slacking. Those little threats of his had better stick. Game, Vaughan. One game till love. Very good, Vaughan. Wonderfully done. Huh? Come in. I appreciate your patience, Adam. Huh? Ah! Welcome, Baker! You know how to keep a man waiting. I gotta say, your lack of communication was beginning to worry me. Oh. What's this? You brought Nanjiro's daughter along? Oh my, I wasn't expecting such a large specimen. I'm surprised she fit through the door 'cause she's gigantic. I mean, what do they feed her? Game, Vaughan. Go on, put that Nanjiro in his place! Listen, Adam. We should probably keep our eyes on the match. - I said, listen! - Listen to what? You should know that this isn't Nanjiro's daughter. Huh? Actually, this girl is my daughter! Wha...? Come on! Yes, of course she's your daughter. Now I see the resemblance. She's quite a beauty, isn't she? Right. She isn't always the most lady-like and can be rough around the edges. Come now, I wouldn't say that, just look at her. Uh, then where is Nanjiro's daughter hiding? Surprise, it's a boy. Nanjiro only has a son, if that much wasn't clear. You're looking at him. His son? Identify yourself! I literally just told you, I'm Nanjiro's son. You hear this kid? Whether Nanjiro has a giant daughter or a confusing son, I couldn't care less! The only thing that matters is ensuring that he loses this match! That won't be happening here. There's going to be a sudden change of plans. Excuse me? You see, my rebellious daughter has taken a liking to this particular boy and said that if I did him a single favor, she'd come back into my life so we'll be one happy family again. What? I don't understand what you're saying. I've grown fond of him during our time together. Huh? So you could say that I've had a change of heart. Baker, that's enough! You explain this instant! Game, Vaughan. Baker, that's enough! You explain this instant! I'll make this clear. This young man requested that I stop match fixing against Nanjiro, which means I have no choice but to decline your request. Hopefully you'll understand. That's ludicrous! We had a deal here! And now you're changing your mind because you feel like it? Remind me of how much money I paid you for this! If I recall, around two million dollars, give or take. Oh. So you do know. Don't forget, Baker! Now keep your end of the bargain! Remind Nanjiro Echizen that his kid's life is on the line! As in, his kid's gonna disappear permanently if he doesn't throw the finals! Mr. Anderson, while I am sorry, business can only go so far and family will always take precedence in my life. Regardless, I have no intention of doing business with the likes of you again. You had the gall to insult my daughter. Some business. How dare you defy the likes of me? Are you aware of the consequences? Yeah, I'm not too worried about that. Huh? Because as of today, pretty sure you won't be a problem. What's that supposed to be? Hey. Say hi to the audience. What? The charade's over, old man. Everybody heard what you said. You ratted yourself out. Rinko! - Hey, you made it. - I'm so sorry. We didn't mean to cause so much trouble for you all but it's all good. Everything is okay. I was worried sick. You're safe, that's what matters. It's just inconceivable. I can't believe this. Probably should've tried playing this fair and square. Vaughan could've won on his own. Chances were slim but you never know, right? What you did, that was no fun. The best way to play is with a proper match. Exactly. Tennis is worth playing fairly because it's a head-on battle on the court. Too bad. You've got a ways to go. Attaboy. He actually did it. So, Vaughan. Come on, gonna run? No, let's go! Don't you forget that I've still got a two set lead! I hope you enjoyed getting those points before. You aren't getting any more of that. Say, what? Oh. That move. What? Game, Echizen! What the hell is going on? Samurai Zone! And a Twist Serve. Zero-shiki. Huh? I know that posture. Samurai Drive! Game set, Echizen. Six games till love. My hair, it's... gone! I gotta hand it to you, you're awesome. Hold on. Is that the same ball? We have an important announcement to make. After receiving word from Weasley Vaughan, he has officially withdrawn from the match. Therefore, the tournament results have been decided. Nanjiro Echizen is the winner by default. Hmm. What kind of match was that? Give us our money back! Congrats on the big win. Ryoma! Kind of. You won by default. Probably wasn't very fun. It's at least better than losing a match that's rigged. You did it! Go, Dad! Good job! You're all safe. That's the real win. Thank you. Whatever, don't mention it. I only wanted you to play a fair match today. And that's all. Regardless, I owe you a huge debt, kid. Yeah, you're right. Pay that debt off now. Wait, what? Guess I walked straight into that. You wanna know my secret sauce, that it? Oh, that's it, isn't it? I could tell by your face, look at you. Hey, down to play a match together? Excuse me? My dad's the one who taught me tennis and since the beginning, I've always wanted to defeat him. You could say that he was my goal. That's the reason why I wanna try to beat you. You're one interesting kid. Also, you're way too cocky. I know. What's your answer? You're on. My debt's paid off. Word of warning though, I won't hold back on you. Ha. Wouldn't want you to. It's all or nothing. Where am I? Ryuzaki. - Ryoma. - I'm right here. Are you okay? Yeah. Wait, hang on. What were we doing again? Something's off. That's right, where are those three guys? Oh, I forgot that my parents are waiting for me! Ryoma, I'm sorry but I gotta hurry back to the market! Hey, by the way... Why are you out here in the US? Why? To get stronger. Always training. You're amazing, Ryoma. I wouldn't say that. I just wanna perfect my skills, that's all. Right. Well, I guess I'll see you around. Have a good time. I hope you have fun getting stronger. Eyes that can thrill with a single look. Those eyes are exhilarating. You were so awesome, Dad! Like super-duper awesome! - You think so? - Dad, listen! I'm gonna be super strong like you one day! - Me too! - Yeah right. You're too tiny to get that good. No, what're you walking about? That one guy earlier, he was short but also strong. You're not wrong. Someone's height isn't really what matters. Bleh. So, anyway, how can I get as strong as you? Good question. Bare minimum, you have to actually enjoy tennis and then... What else? Ah, nothing. After you little rascals grow up a bit, then I might tell you. For real? But I wanna know right now. You'll understand when you're older, trust me. Dad? Do you promise you'll tell me when I grow up? That isn't fair, I asked first. Boys, you're heavier than you think. Tell us when we grow up!

You got a ways to go. Cool. Looks like this is gonna be fun.
