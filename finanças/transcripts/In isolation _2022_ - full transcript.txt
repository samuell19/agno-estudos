[sirens wailing] [man on TV] I was home when they broke down the door. They took everything in the house, even the goddamn food in the fridge. [ominous music] - [rioters yelling] - [sirens wailing] [Reporter] It seems that fear has become more contagious than the virus itself. [thunder rumbling] [car engine rumbling] [thunder rumbling] [lighter clicking] [rain pattering] [bath water splashing] [rain pattering continues] [rain pattering continues] [pills rattling] [cabinet creaking] [phone dings] [phone dings] [rain pattering] - [thunder booming] - [phone thudding] [electricity buzzing] - [thunder rumbling] - [Jane gasps] [Jane panting] [suspenseful music] - [wind whooshing] - [window slamming] - [Jane gasping] - [eerie music] [thunder booming] [Jane gasps] [light eerie music] [Father] Where is it? Where is the bottle? [Mother] No, you've had enough! - [hand slapping] - Ow! [Father] Where's Jane? I'm looking for her. - Huh? - [thunder booming] [Mother] No, please, no. Leave her alone. - [fist pounding on door] - [Father] Jane? Open the door. I know you're in there. Come on! - Open up! - [thunder booming] [Mother] Will you stop it? Leave her alone. Just leave us alone! - [Father] Shut up! - [Mother] [groans] Ow! - [thunder booming] - Ow! - [Jane whimpering] - [Mother crying] [ominous music] [eerie chiming] It's all right, Jane. You've done so well. That's enough for today, okay? I'll see you again next week. Good work. Could you write me a new prescription for my pills? If I remember correctly, you should have enough for two more weeks. I think I lost them when I was getting out of the car, probably. Good. You know, I think it's time we started weening you off of them anyway, especially with the progress you've made today. What do you mean alright? Look at this. It could be so much worse. How are things going in your personal life? Fine. We're texting. We're going to have a date. Okay, I'll write you the prescription. But again, I repeat, these pills are not magic. The solution to your problems lies on the other side of your fears, Jane. [Reporter] Law enforcement cracked down on unauthorized demonstrations today as more and more people joined the protests against a possible quarantine. The public is growing increasingly dissatisfied with the government's response to the crisis. In light of these recent protests, the government has decided to halt- - - [suspenseful music] - [hand tapping] - Hey, let's go. - [Protestor] End Quarantine! - Let's go, let's go. - [Protestor] End isolation! - We demand freedom! - [Protestor] End isolation! - We want our rights. - We want our rights. - End quarantine. - We want our freedom. - End quarantine. - No isolation! - End isolation. - We have our freedoms. - We want our rights. - We want our rights. - We want our rights back. - We want our freedom.

I'll call you if there's anything I can do. But don't get your hopes up 'cause half the city's lost power in the storm, you know? No, no, please, I'm begging you. I really need it right now, urgently. 'Cause I have no lights, no power, no signal, nothing. - I'm dying, really. - Oh, wow. It sounds like we got a real apocalypse on our hands. Exactly.

Why do you think so? Your Instagram posts. It's only your thoughts. I need them to promote my workshop. Here it is. [Ray] So, this is where all your wax masterpieces - come from? - [Jane sighs] Not masterpieces, just candles. Can you show me? Now it's a bit messy inside, but I think I can show you something. - Be right back, okay? - Okay. [door creaking] - Close your eyes. - [Ray sighs] Come on. Open up. Oh, wow. That's beautiful.

[Ray sighs] [wind whooshing] [bottles rattling] What? Hair of the dog. Looks like you're trying to keep the party going. Last night was stressful. I deserve it. You've got some weird friends. Don't talk about Jane like that. She's not well. So what? Everything's my fault now? How was I supposed to know about the fucking candles? I told you she's got a phobia. I get it, she's scared of the dark. But why is she freaking out so much? - She's crazy. - Maybe you're fucking crazy. - Fuck off. - [toilet paper roll thudding] [door creaking] I, I just wanna say goodbye. Then, goodbye. [Ray] Jane, I'm sorry about last night. You have nothing to apologize for. Are you sure you wanna stay here alone? Hm?

Girl, you have to calm the fuck down. Hey, hey, no, no, wait, wait! - Ugh! - [Kriss] Will! [Will] What the fuck is happening here? [ominous music] [Ray] Do you know him? [Jane] Yes, I met him in the town. He's a worker. I was expecting him to check the power in the house. [Ray] He's alive. We have to get him to the hospital. Okay? [ominous music continues] What happened to him? Nothing. What a pain in the ass. If anything happens, we were never here. [Kriss sighs] [ominous music] How is he? I think he's coming to. It's all right. We're taking you into town. They'll help you there. What happened to you? There's a man here. - It's them. - Who? They're crazy. They robbed me and almost killed me. - [ominous music] - What's going on here? Don't stop. Keep driving, and step on it. Guys, do you have any idea what's happening in town? People are going insane over that virus. Everyone's in a panic. I saw them breaking into a few houses. They stopped me on the road in this forest. I was stabbed, but I got away. But not before getting one of their guys, too. Let's go, let's go. Let's get the fuck out of here. What the hell? No, no, no, no, go, go! [ominous music] - Hi, there. - Hello. I'm new around here. I was out hunting, but I think I've got myself a little lost. Oh, yeah, it happens a lot. If you follow this road you'll get into town. Thanks. The thing is, I'm looking for my brother. He's a little off, if you know what I mean. I thought he could use some fresh air, but he cut himself on a bunch of branches. Had a bit of an episode. He ran off into the woods somewhere. You haven't seen anyone? - Oh, we did. - Great. Where did you see him? Oh, well, I mean, we heard someone was shouting at the other side of the forest. But I'm going into town, and if you want to, I can call the police for you. That would be great. All right. Any chance I could catch a ride out there? No, I'm sorry. You are a stranger and we're in a deep forest. Anything can happen. I'll just look for him myself then. Mm hm. But tell them now, in town. [window whirring] [window shattering] - [dramatic music] - Go, go, go! - [rubble skidding] - [Ray groaning] - [foot thudding] - [hooded looter groaning] - [tires screeching] - [car crashing] [heartbeat pounding] Run them over! [car engine sputtering] Come on! [Jane] Come on. [car engine rumbling] I need to take Kriss. [dramatic music] [water splashing] - Boo! - [Kriss gasps] - [Will chuckling] - [hand slapping] Weak. That's how they used to spank when I was a kid. That's the best you can do? Is it warm in there? Hm, keep playing these stupid games and it'll get cold. [Kriss moaning] [Kriss moaning] [car engine rumbling] [car horn honking] [both moaning] Did you hear that? - Fuck it. - [Kriss moaning] [car horn honking] Are they sleeping there or what? What are you waiting for, guys? - We don't have time. - [car horn honking] I'm going inside. - Stay in the car. - [car horn honking] Hey! - Kriss, Will! - [car horn honking] [Jane gasps] - Oh, shit! - [car horn honking] We have to go. Listen to me! Whoa, whoa, bro, occupied. We have to get outta here, Kriss. Just tell me what's happening already! There's no time. We'll talk in the car. - Be right back. - Get in the car! What is he doing? - [Ray] You idiot! - [Kriss] Will! - [Ray] Will! - I'm not leaving without my stuff. - No way. - Just go without him. No, I'm not going without him. - [Will] Ah, my precious. - [ominous music] I've got it! [Ray] Will, turn around! [Kriss] Will! Is the show over? - [flesh squishing] - [dramatic music] [Kriss screaming] He killed him! Shut the fuck up! - Start the car. - [Kriss] Will! The show is only just beginning. - [flesh squishing] - [Kriss screaming] [dramatic music] - Fucking spark plugs. - [Tony] Start it. Come on! - [Ray] Out of the car, quick! - [Kriss] No! [Ray] Let's go! [dramatic music] [Kriss panting] That's only one. - Where's the other one? - [Tony groans] Check upstairs. [Kriss] Oh, Will, he killed him. - He killed Will. - [suspenseful music] - He's dead. - [dramatic music] - [knife clanking] - [hooded looter grunting] [Hooded Looter] Come on! [ax thudding] [light eerie music] [Tony groaning] - Oh, oh, shit. - [Jane] Careful. - Just let me look. - Bastard. [Tony sighs] Not looking good, is it? [Jane] It'll be fine. [Tony groans] - Shit! - [Jane] You're okay. Reminds me of one of those shitty-ass Bruce Willis movies. [Ray] We need a plan. They'll find a way, sooner or later. Do you have any other weapons? Yeah, I have a gun, but it's in the workshop. Now, that's one option. What about the windows? Huh? They're strong. They won't break in. We need to check everything. Okay? One more time. [Ray] Okay. [birds chirping] - [floor creaking] - [Jane sighing] [wrapper crinkling] [dry pasta rattling] We're having spaghetti for our last supper? - Not funny. - [Tony] Hm. This should be enough for the four of us. Okay. [lighter clicking] - You know... - [Ray] Hm? I saw this movie a while back. Some kind of apocalypse film. Whole bunch of people locked themselves in a house, or maybe it was a lab. They have to start eating each other to survive. So, let's just be ready for the worst. [floor creaking] [Tony chuckling] It's a joke, man. Relax. [Tony chuckling] [footsteps thudding] [ominous music] [Ray] Where's Kriss? - [attic latch slamming] - [eerie music] Kriss? [dramatic music] [Jane grunts] - Help! - [attic latch slamming] Help, guys! Someone doesn't look very happy to see me. Jane, get Kriss out of here. Can you hold it? Just hurry up already. [Jane] Kriss, come on. - Kriss, wake up. - [dramatic music] [Tony groaning] [bottles clanking] [light eerie music] [ax thudding] [intense dramatic music] [Tony groaning] [Tony panting] - [ax thudding] - [wood splintering] Hurry up! - [ax thudding] - [wood splintering] - [ominous music] - [Tony groaning] Here comes daddy. - [flesh squishing] - [looter screaming] Fuck! [suspenseful music] [wind whooshing] [Tony sighs] - [Jane gasps] - [Tony groaning] - Hold on. - Okay. [Tony sighs] [Jane hushes] - All right. - Thank you. Okay. [lighter clicking] [Tony deeply inhales] How long was I out for? Not so long. And the men? Oh, they didn't come back. Ray hasn't seen them. Maybe the left. I doubt it. These beasts can smell blood a mile away. And I, I'm soaked in it. They'll probably wait until dark. [cigarette sizzling] - You know? - [Jane] Hm? I never got the chance to try your coffee. God blesses you. - [Jane giggling] - Why? 'Cause I'm... I'm a very bad barista. - [Jane giggling] - Really? So, you lied to me then. Sorry, life is life. Well, I got a confession, too. I'm kind of a shitty electrician myself. [both laughing] Aren't we a naughty couple? - [both laughing] - [Tony groaning] Got some vitamins for me? They're my fear pills. I wouldn't mind a little help with my own fears. You, you don't need them. I have, I have nyctophobia. I'm afraid of the dark since I was a kid. [light eerie music] -When my father drank, -[fist pounding] he became aggressive. [Father] Jane! - [thunder booming] - Open the door. I know you're in there. [Mother] Stop it, leave her alone. Just leave us alone! - [fist thudding] - [Father] Shut up! [Mother] [groans] Ow! - [thunder booming] - Ow! [Jane] He beat me. And my mother. Mom hid me in the scariest place in the house. Only the flame of a candle saved me from the darkness of the basement. Once, my drunk father fell asleep with a cigarette, and there was a fire. I began to suffocate, but I could not get out. Not because of the fire, but because I was afraid - of my father more than death. - [Jane coughing] [Father] Jane, open the door! - Jane. - Go away. - You're not true. - [father chuckling] [Father] Jane, Jane. [door creaking] - By some miracle I survived. - [light dramatic music] [Young Jane gasping] And the only thing he gave me the day he left, is fear. - [Jane sniffling] - Hey. [somber music] - We're lucky, you and I. - [Jane giggling] Look what my father left me. He held it down and refused to let go, even when I was in agony. I got really good at faking it. I would pretend to black out. And that's when he, he would finally let go. But you know, I, I don't hate him. I hate the bastards that killed him before I could do it myself. Well, when this is all over, we'll go to whichever cafe serves the best coffee in town. [Jane] Mm hm. Hey, I promise you that. - Okay? - [Jane] Mm hm. [lighter clicking] [Jane sniffling] [upbeat music] Kriss? [Kriss] This is the song that was playing when we met. You know, it's strange. I really thought we were going to be something serious, but now he's just lying there out in the road. That's what I get for being such a whore my entire life. [Jane] Well, Kriss, you're not a whore. Stub it out. What? Put the cigarette out. Why would I do that? Jane doesn't like the smell in the house. Seems like she made an exception for me. I always used them. I used you, too. In school, guys were always falling at your feet, and I was so jealous. I was afraid of being alone. Do you know how many fires happen because of cigarettes? Pray tell. - One in five. - [cigarette sizzling] Sounds serious. But I'm very, very careful. Watch this. [head thudding] Do you know how many people die from domestic violence? Huh? - [bodies thumping] - [Ray grunting] - [elbow thudding] - [fists thudding] [Jane] It doesn't matter, it was in the past... But it still matters to me. I wasn't just jealous. You dated them, I fucked with them. [Kriss giggling] [dramatic music] [lamp clanking] [lamp shattering] [Tony grunts] Come on. [Ray yelling] - [chair crashing] - [Ray groaning] [both panting] [fist thudding] [Tony gasping] - Let him go. - Get him off me. - Get him off of me. - [Jane panting] [Tony gasps] [Tony spits] - [Tony coughing] - What's wrong with you? [door thudding] - [suspenseful music] - [Jane gasps] Kriss! - Kriss, come back. - [ominous music] - [Kriss] I'm sorry. - No, Kriss! [Ray] Jane. [Jane] Ray, please, we need to do something. It's too late. - [Jane] No. - It's too late. - No! - Jane. Kriss, no! [ominous music] [ominous music continues] [Ray] We have to do something. We can't just sit here and wait for them to kill us. Or wait till you kill each other. The woman speaks the truth. We have to take a risk. There's no way we'll make it out at night. The gun, it's in the workshop, right? I don't know where it is. I don't know if I have any bullets. We have to try. You distract them while I try to escape through the attic. A noble deed worthy of a true hero. Where exactly is the gun? The gun is in the workshop I think. But there's a side entrance. You'll need to look hard. It might be under the wooden table. It's somewhere. [light dramatic music] Okay, listen. I'll go out there and start making some noise. [Jane] Mm hm. [Tony] You stay sharp and hold the door. - You go it? - [Jane] Got it. [ominous music] [ominous music continues] [ominous music continues] [ominous music continues] [car engine sputtering] [Tony] Come on. [car engine sputtering] [car engine rumbling] [ominous music] Hurry up! - Come on! - [suspenseful music] Oh, come on, come on, come on. - [door slamming] - [hooded looter groaning] [knife thudding] [door latch clicking] [ominous music] - [fist pounding] - [looter grunts] [Ray gasps] [looter grunts] - [hooded looter grunts] - [rock thudding] [Tony sighing] [footsteps thudding] [boxes clamoring] [Ray panting] [Ray panting continues] [knife clinking] [papers rustling] [Ray panting] [shotgun clicks] [Ray panting] [shotgun shells rattling] Yes. - [box of shells thudding] - [Ray panting] Oh God. [birds cawing] [floor creaking] [door creaking] [footsteps thudding] [wind howling] [suspenseful music] - [flesh squishing] - [elbow thudding] [hooded looter groaning] [gunshot banging] - [flesh squishing] - [Ray screaming] [suspenseful music] [gunshot banging] [shotgun clicking] [light eerie music] [light eerie music continues] [Ray panting] No way they'll come back. [Tony] We only got two shots left. One for each of 'em. We need to stay here for now. You shouldn't try to stand up by yourself, okay? He's getting worse. We need to do something. We have to leave, Jane. No! We'll get him into town. He needs help. We won't even making it two steps with him. They'll kill us. When you needed my help, I didn't leave you. He's right. - [Ray groaning] - No, no, no, no, no. - No. - [Ray panting] Don't say that. We have well, weapons. We'll make it. If you try to save me, it'll kill us all. Yeah, he's right. - And you know that, Jane. - No! I'm not leaving you. No way. Give us the gun and go. [Tony scoffs] Why are you so stubborn, Jane? - [footsteps pounding] - [Jane gasps] Hold on. - It's okay. - [Jane sighs] All right, we'll leave. On one condition: We'll come back for him. How are you gonna do it? They know we're armed. And when they figure out that we're gone, they're gonna take all the stuff from the house. Then we'll come back with medical supplies - and leave together. - All right. Sounds good. I know a forester. - He lives nearby. - [light eerie music] I think he has everything we need and spark plugs, too. It's like half an hour from here. [Ray sighing] - Be careful. - [Ray panting] [Ray] I'm okay. Thanks. [Ray groaning] Well, don't take too long. I'll be downstairs. We have no time. [door slamming] [Ray panting] Hey. How are you feeling? I can manage. You have to be here for a while. But we, we'll come back for you. I promise. I'll be here. - We'll be right back. - Yeah. [chuckles] All right. [somber music] Um, I'm really, I'm really sorry that... That everything's had to be like this. It'll be a story for our grandkids. [both chuckling] [somber music continues] [lips smacking] [somber music continues] [Ray panting] [ominous music] [Ray blowing] [ominous music continues] I hope they won't find him till we get back. - They won't. - [Jane] Hm? If he stays quiet. - We'll be out in the dark. - [Jane] Mm hm. You forget something? [stairs creaking] - Run! - [Jane gasps] [looter grunting] [hooded looter chuckling] [Jane screaming] - [Tony grunts] - [fists thudding] - [hand slamming] - [looter groans] [dramatic music] [door slamming] [hooded looter growling] - [foot thudding] - [shotgun rattling] - [head thudding] - [Tony groans] [looter yelling] [table crashing] Don't leave me here alone. I'm scared. - [foot thudding] - [looter groaning] [suspenseful music] - [hooded looter yelling] - [hands slamming] - [ominous music] - [Tony panting] - [fist thudding] - [Tony groans] [hands slamming] - [flesh squishing] - [hooded looter groans] - [fist slamming] - [Tony] Oh, shit! - [foot thudding] - [elbow thudding] - [hooded looter chuckling] - [head slamming] - [Ray groaning] - [hooded looter panting] [Tony panting] [looter growling] - [foot thudding] - [body thumping] [Ray panting] - [Ray groaning] - [table crashing] [dramatic music] - [flesh squishing] - [hooded looter groaning] [Ray groaning] - [foot slamming] - [body thumping] [foot thudding] - [hooded looter chuckling] - [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [table crashing] [intense dramatic music] [Jane panting] [light eerie music] [dramatic music] [Jane panting] [looter panting] [Jane panting] [Jane sighing] [looter panting] [Jane gasping] [looter growls] [Jane panting] Gotcha! [suspenseful music] [flashlight thuds] - [stick thudding] - [looter groans] - [bear trap crunches] - [looter screams] - [stick thudding] - [looter groans] [Jane panting] - [suspenseful music] - [Jane gasps] [looter yelling] - [Jane groaning] - [looter grunting] - [body thumping] - Ow! - [teeth crunching] - [looter screaming] - [Jane panting] - [looter growling] - [hand slapping] - [Jane groaning] What a smell. - [bear trap chain rattling] - [Jane groaning] [looter screaming] - [Jane panting] - [looter grunting] - [looter growling] - [Jane gasping] I think we are about to get real close. - [flashlight thudding] - [looter groaning] - [elbow thudding] - [looter groaning] - [Jane gasping] - [looter gagging] - [Jane screaming] - [Tony hushes] Quiet. It's me. Okay. Nice job with that one. [chuckling] Oh, Jane. [Jane gasps] Yeah? [ominous music] - [birds cawing] - Oh shit. It's okay. It's okay. [suspenseful music] [Jane screaming] Jane! - Snap out of it. - [Jane whimpering] - [suspenseful music] - Fuck, Jane! - Oh my God. - Listen to me. - Oh my God. - Jane. - [Jane whimpering] - Listen to me. - As soon as I throw this, run. - No! - One, two, three. - No, no. - Run. - [flashlight thudding] [suspenseful music] [gunshot banging] [fist thudding] [both grunting] [looter gagging] - [suspenseful music] - [Jane panting] - [foot thudding] - [Tony groaning] [looter growling] [Looter] Fuck you. - [Jane panting] - [ominous music] - [body thumping] - [suspenseful music] - [foot thudding] - [looter grunting] [gun thudding] - [fist thudding] - Greedy piece of shit. - You're gonna pay for that. - [foot thudding] [Tony groaning] - [thunder booming] - [Jane whimpering] [Father] Jane. [Jane screaming] [body thumping] - [foot thudding] - [Tony groaning] [Jane gasping] [suspenseful music] - Jane. - [Jane panting] - [fist thudding] - [dramatic music] [both panting] [looter grunting] [Jane panting] - [head thudding] - [Tony groaning] [suspenseful music] - [gunshot banging] - [Jane gasping] [ominous music] [Jane wheezing] [ominous music continues] Jane. Hey, Jane, Jane, Jane. Come on, girl. Don't pass out on me now. Jane, Jane. [Tony sighs] [Tony panting] Come on, girl. Swallow it. Swallow it. Hey, it'll help. Hey, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Hey, girl, come on. Come on, Jane. - Hey. - [Jane coughing] [hushes] Hey. Hey, there you go. You know you won't get away from me that easy. Understand? You still owe me that coffee date. Remember? - Yeah? - [Jane crying] [Jane panting] [Tony hushes] [wind whooshing] [Jane panting] [Jane] Tom? Tom, are you here? Maybe he's not around. - Huh? - [Jane sighs] We should grab everything we need and go back. Okay. - [door creaking] - [wind howling] Light switch. [lights clicking] [cellar door creaking] Thanks. [dust pan clanking] [wooden trunk thudding] [Tony spits] Well, that's a nice start. [Jane groaning] That'll do. [Tom] I would put that back if I were you. - [Tony] Tom. - [Tom] Stay where you are. Easy, old man. I'm a friend. [Tom] You're no friend of mine. [phone buzzing] [eerie music] I'm here with Jane. - We need your help. - Jane, you say? So, who are you? I came over to fix her power. The power was off. And then some robbers attacked the house. Where'd they come from? It's only a forest. They're not people, Tom. More like wild animals. We barely fought them off. [eerie music] [Reporter] Three masked men pull out an ATM directly from the bank branch. According to the police chief, the criminals took advantage of the turmoil caused by the city protests. Two masked men left the branch [distorted audio]. [suspenseful music] [Jane panting] Tom, ask Jane if you don't believe me. She's in the cellar. Someone got hurt back at the house. We need supplies, you know? In the cellar, you say? Keep your hands where I can see them. Okay. [ominous music] [Operator] 911, what's your emergency? We need help. [Operator] What's wrong? We, we were attacked by the men from the news. [Operator] Okay, what's your address, ma'am? - [Tony] Jane, Tom's here. - [Operator] Ma'am? - [Tony] Can you come up? - [Operator] Ma'am? I'm coming. [ominous music] [Tom] What's happened, dear? [Jane] We were attacked. [Tom] Are you all right? I'm fine. We need to call the police and go back before Ray bleeds to death, right? Yeah. Did you find the spark plugs? Yeah, we can go. Come on. - [phone buzzing] - [light dramatic music] Are you going to answer it? - [suspenseful music] - The gun! [dramatic music] [gun clicking] [flesh squishing] - [body thumping] - [Tom gagging] [suspenseful music] [cellar door slamming] [hand slamming] [Tony chuckling] Jane? Hey, open up. They died because of you. No, because of you. If you'd just driven into town, they'd all be alive right now. But you went back and you killed them. - It's not true. - [hand slamming] - Because you're stubborn! - Shut up! [Jane crying] [tools clanking] We could still walk away. I got money. You hear me? - Lots of money. - [Jane sniffling] Jane, Jane, Jane. It's a shame it's not gonna work out between us. - [ominous music] - [Jane gasps] Sweet dreams, babe. [Jane whimpering] - [hand slamming] - [cellar door rattling] [Jane panting] [Jane gasping] [body thumping] [ominous music continues] [Jane gasping] [Jane panting] [Jane crying] [Father] Open this goddamn door. Who raised you to be this stubborn? - Jane. - No, you're not real. - Go away. - [Father] Jane. [Jane whimpering] [ominous music] Jane! - Open this goddamn door! - [ominous music] [Jane crying] [dramatic music] [wind whistling] [wind whistling continues] [wind whistling continues] [light eerie music] [wind whistling] [Young Jane coughing] [fist slamming] [Jane grunts] [Young Jane coughing] - [fists slamming] - [Jane screaming] [light eerie music] [light eerie music continues] [suspenseful music] [Young Jane gasps] [light eerie music] [light eerie music continues] - [window sheer whooshing] - [gentle music] [gentle music continues] [Jane gasping] [gentle music continues] [gentle music continues] [Jane groaning] - [cellar door rattling] - [Jane panting] - [fists slamming] - [cellar door rattling] [Jane sighing] [floor creaking] [wheezing] You're alive. [body thumping] [Tony] Oh, hello. [Ray groaning] [Ray gasping] [hood slamming] [car engine rumbling] [Ray groaning] [Ray panting] Where's Jane? She's in the car. It's over. You want some, hm? For courage. Jane! Jane! [suspenseful music] Jane! [body thumping] [Ray coughing] Ray, Ray, Ray. [foot thudding] [suspenseful music] You know, Jane and I had a little talk. We decided that you're dead weight. - Hm? - [Ray panting] What have you done with her? Some might say I killed her, but I think I gave her a chance. You know? - [Ray groaning] - A fighting chance. - [elbow thudding] - [Ray panting] Shit. You're a good guy, Ray. Work like a dog. [suspenseful music] [gasoline sloshing] [eerie music] Girls love guys like that, yeah? But you know, loyalty can get you killed. [gasoline sloshing] [eerie music] I always knew there was something wrong with you. Oh, I guess you're not as stupid as you look. You're a coward and buy your way, your way... Buy your way out with other people's lives. Fear is a very powerful thing. It's stronger than you think, huh? It's everywhere; it's in every corner of this house. It slithers onto your clothes. It worms your way under its head. Drives you insane, huh? Do you feel it? Do you feel it? [wind whistling] - [Jane gasps] - Do you think I'm afraid of you? You're afraid or a fool, man. Doesn't matter now, though. - [gasoline splashing] - [Ray coughing] [Tony humming] [Ray coughing and gasping] Aw. [gasoline container thudding] [Ray coughing] [Jane gasps] - [Ray coughing] - [lighter clicking] Do you know the story of Prometheus? - Hm? - [Ray wheezing] -The Titan that gave humans -[Ray coughing] the gift of fire. - [lighter clicking] - [Ray panting] Hm? Why do you think that Zeus punished him? Ray, tell me. - [hand slapping] - [Ray gasping] Because it wasn't just fire. Prometheus gave people the gift of hope. He thought he could rid, rid humans of fear. But Zeus knew that fear is our one true ruler. [fire roaring] Fuck. Not everyone can be entrusted with this power. No, no, no, no. You can't run from fear. You have no where to go. [rock music] You hear? Maybe it's an alarm. Time for somebody to wake up.
