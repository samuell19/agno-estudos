(ethereal music) (majestic music) (upbeat music) (contemplative music) (kids shouting in distance) (basketball thudding) (net rustling) - Nothing, but net. - How'd you do that? - Do what? - Make that shot with your eyes closed? (net rustling) I'd like to see you try that again. (net rustling) OK, eight apiece. - [Desi] What? - Eight, eight. - Legget, why do you always do this. That was six. - That was eight. - That was six. If you paid better attention maybe you'd get abetter grade in math. - I got a C plus last quarter. (both laughing) - Isn't this sweet. This is so sweet I'm getting a cavity just standing here. - Hey, Tyler, what's up? - Sorry, Legs, I didn't mean to interfere with anything between you and Pokey here. - Pokey? - What's the matter? Haven't you read the latest issue of "Spycat?" - No. - Oh, it's great. Spycat makes friends with this girl named Pokey. She's just about to blossom into a woman. "Spycat" helps her with her training bra. (boys laughing) - Oh, no. - Forget about her, Legs. (bluesy jazz music) - Dad! Dad, how could you do this to me? - What did I do now? - Pokey, Pokey? I'm the laughing stock of the entire eighth grade. Now everybody knows about you know. - Honey, about what? - Don't say it! Just don't even say it. (ethereal music) - Is there anyway I can help? - Desi, every girl goes through this kind of a stage and I just thought Spycat could offer some helpful hints on the situation. - Maybe we can find a way. - But why didn't you ask me? Now everybody's gonna call me Pokey. Did you ever think about that? (phone rings) - I gotta get that. - Fine. - Desi! Oh, "Spycat." What? Oh, hi, Peyton. No, I haven't been jogging. No, it's just Desi. She's a little upset about last week's "Spycat." Yeah, I know. It's a coming of age thing. She's a little shy about developing. What? Really? Wait a minute. You're kidding, me? Well, yeah, sure I'm interested in meeting them. Tell me more. - [Tyler Voiceover] What's the matter? Haven't you read the latest issue of "Spycat?" Oh, it's great. Spycat makes friends with this girl named Pokey. She's a just about to blossom into a woman. Spycat helps her with her training bra. (contemplative music) (birds calling) - Well, no that's great. Well, tonight at six? Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure. No, no, no, no six is fine. Yeah, all right, I'll see you then. Bye bye. - [Desi Voiceover] Now everybody knows about you know. - [Cameron Voiceover] Honey, about what? - [Desi Voiceover] Don't say it! Just don't even say it. - 13 stinks. I don't see how 14 can be much better. (doorbell rings) - Oh, no, not again. (doorbell chiming) - Oh, no. - I'll get it. Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt. Here we go again. - [Girl] Oh, and she was, like-- - I know, they were fake, they're fake. Have you seen them? All over it. - Can you believe Rhonda served hotdogs and hamburgers at her birthday party? - Like, hello, Earth to Rhonda. - No kidding, like I'm having Cannelloni from Vito's. - Oh, really, is it fat free? - Please. (clears throat) - The offer expires in 10 seconds. - Anyway, as I was saying did you see her face? It was so-- - I know, it's like she-- - Good afternoon, ladies. How was school? - [Girl] Hi Mr. Brooks. - Nice talking to you ladies. - Oh my gosh, that is so gross. - Oh, no, I could never do that. I can't believe you actually saw her. That is so gross. But I told you, don't believe Alice. - I swear, I never know what those two are talking about. They have a language all their own. Like my father always said. Children should be seen and not spoken to. Think about it. - Miss Morningside, can I speak to you for a moment? - Yes, Mr. Brooks? - Well, I guess you know things have been, well, kind of rough around here since my wife passed on, well, I'm not sure how to say this. You've been such a blessing for Desi, but I don't know if I can afford you-- - Mr. Brooks, don't worry about me. You can pay me when things work out. - Oh, Miss Morningside I-- - I've said my peace and that's all I'm gonna say. There are some thing that are more important than money, like family. Now, what do you want for lunch? I've got a very nice brisket. - With a glass of milk? - Glass of milk coming up. Oh, and one more thing, Mr. Brooks. My father always told me, it's always darkest right after you turn out the light. Think about it. - What's this? - It's an Vera Wang dress. Don't you just love the sequins. Desi, it's an invitation to a birthday party. - Birthday party? - Not just any birthday party. It's my birthday party. - And I have exactly one week to get this guy to notice me, strike up a meaningful conversation, begin a relationship and then, ask him to the party. I just don't have any margin for error so please. - Geez, Pleasance, get a grip. It's just a birthday party, not the playoffs. - Just because you don't like boys-- - Breathe, breathe. One, two, three. See what you've done. - You started it. Why do you have to have a boy-girl party anyway? Why can't it just be us? - That was last year. Desi, darling, how can I say this to you without hurting your little feelings? Our birthday's may only be two days apart, but in milestone's there is an eon of difference between us. I've grown out of all that nonsense. - Nonsense, huh? - Desi, sweetie, it's a time to put down your toys and become a woman. It's a time to stop dribbling and dance. Boys don't go with girls who compete with them at sweaty games. - Gaynor, three weeks ago you wouldn't go out for intramural swimming because we have to share the pool with the boys team. - That's exactly my point. - What is? - You are so naive. Do you really think boys let you play basketball because you're good at it? There'll be a band, no jeans, no sneakers, no baseball caps. And don't bring anything embarrassing. No pink shirts, no teddy bears, no ghost stories, oh, and just one more thing. You have to come with a boy. No boy, no party. Coming? Pleasance, time to motivate. Are we gonna the mall or not? - Of course. - Oh, yeah, and Desi, don't forget to bring gifts. I mean it is a birthday party after all. Did you see Rhonda? - [Pleasance] I know, but Alice. - What have I gotten myself into now? - [Pleasance] Can you believe her? - I know, she wears this red cap, that was like so five years ago. - I know, that was, she's been wearing that for years and years. - I know, she totally needs a change. - Oh, definitely, she is so-- - We need to take her to the mall. - That would be so cool. - I know and let's get her a make over. - Oh, that would be great. - Oh, Miss Melanie, it's very hard to be 14. Remember? - Yes, I do. - And there's only so much I can do from up here. - Maybe this is a good time to ask Peter for a favor. You know he loved your hollyhocks. They were the most beautiful we've ever seen. - Really? I can hardly believe it. They were my first you know. For so many years I've gone with roses. - Gabriel was truly delighted. And Peter was beside himself. And I think a tiny bit envious. - So you think he might let me? - I can't promise anything. But you may have to share all your gardening secrets with him. - I sing to them. - Sing to them. - Lullabies. (both giggling) - Oh, I cannot wait to see the look on his face when I tell him that. I'll see what I can do. - Oh, thank you Miss Melanie. Um, do you think there's anyway we could kind of hurry it up? - RJ. (Melanie laughing) - [Gaynor Voiceover] No boy, no party, coming? - Pokey here. - [Gaynor Voiceover] Sweetie, it's time to put down your toys and become a woman. (sultry music) (contemplative music) Do you really think boys let you play basketball with them because you're good at it? (Legget laughs) - [Desi Voiceover] Why can't it just be us? - [Gaynor Voiceover] Just because you don't like boys. (doorbell rings) - Now what? - I got it, I got it. (sultry music) Hello, Peyton. - Cameron. - Well, come in, come in. How are you? - I'm excellent. Oh, Cameron, it's so good to see you again. - Well, likewise. Whew, you look great. - Don't I though? It's a brand-new dress. Italian. - Uh, very nice. Here, let me show you next week's "Spycat." - Oh, excellent. - Over here. - I'm honored. You know I absolutely adored last week's strip. You know the one about Pokey. - Really? - So, this is where the magic takes place. - Uh, yeah, I guess. - No, I'm serious. I really think your work strikes a chord in today's youth. I really think with my help we can quadruplet its distribution. - Yeah, well, I've never been very good at presenting my work. - Well you just leave that to me. That's what I'm here for. I'll wrap those distributors around my little finger over drinks, by dessert we'll be selling "Spycat" in Venezuela. - Wow. I've always wanted to go to Caracas. - Oh, no dear, we're eating Pierre's a tonight. - Right, Pierre's. Hey, listen. Make yourself comfortable. I want you to meet someone. - Hurry back. (knocking on door) - [Desi] Come in. - Hey, Desi, I want you to come downstairs and meet somebody. - Who? - My new agent. Her name's Peyton. Come on, I want you to meet her. - Looks like your new agent's out of luck tonight, Dad. - What? - Mmm, how quaint. - Hey. Come on, Desi. Hey look. I'm sorry for not asking you about your, uh, well, you know. But I really need you to come down and meet my new agent. She's got some great ideas about "Spycat." She thinks it's gonna be huge. Hey, she thinks it's gonna be so huge that maybe we won't have to sell the house. Come on. Gotcha! ( Desi laughing) Come on. - Stop! - I should have known. - Thanks, Desi, I owe you one. - You owe me two. - One. - Two. - One. - Dad. - OK, two. Peyton, I want to introduce you to someone. Peyton, this is my-- - What an adorable little boy. - No, Peyton, he is a she. - What? - This is Desi, my daughter. I told you about her on the phone. My little girl. - Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry. I had no idea. - Desi, hold on. - Oh, Cameron, we really should go. - But, but I have to talk to-- - No buts. Desi will be just fine. It's just a phase that we all go through. Even I went through it. - [Cameron] OK. - I'm sorry if I hurt her feelings. But you have to admit it was kind of funny. Anyway, I promise I will make it up to her. But right now we need to make you famous. Here. - Please tell me you're not buying this. - All right, I guess you know what's best. - Now you're talking turkey. - It's a just been so hard since. Well, since her mother passed away. Sometimes I have no idea what's going on with her. - After tonight's meeting you will have the hottest publication on the market and you'll be able to hire the best child psychologist. - What? - Just kidding, darling. No, seriously, Cam. If you ever need any help with your daughter please don't be afraid to ask me. As your new partner, that's what I'm here for. I'm here for you. - Well, thanks, Peyton. You know, I might just take you up on that offer. - Excellent. Now, lets get down to business. Cameron, do you have bats in here? - Bats? - Never mind. Let's go. - Desi, I'm leaving. (melancholy music) (Desi sobbing) (papers rustling) (ethereal music) - Peter wants me to tell you good luck. - Oh, Miss Melanie, thank you so much. - You're welcome RJ. But first we're gonna have to do something about the way you look. (magical twinkling) (gentle music) (pensive music) (net rustling) (net rustling) - Three points, all net. How's that, Brooks? Hey, Desi. Nice shot. How about some one on one. What do you say? - I say, why don't you go soak your head, Legs? - [Legget] Oh, come on. You're still not mad about yesterday. - Yesterday? What happened yesterday? - [Legget] OK, fine. If you're afraid to play me, I understand. Sorry to bother you, Pokey. - Do you really think by calling that you're gonna bait me into playing one on one with you? - Absolutely. - Winner's out. Got to win by two. - [Legget] Oh boy, you're going down hard. - You better pinch yourself. I think you're dreaming. - Ha, ha. Who's dreaming? It's my out. Who's dreaming? - [Desi] Throw me the ball, Legs. Who's going down? - Yeah, yeah. Come on, make your move. Ow! What the heck was that for, Brooks? - What did you think you were doing, Legget? - Guarding. - Yeah, well, you better watch it. - What did I do? (Desi sobbing) (ethereal music) - [RJ] Here, take it. - You don't really want me to blow my nose into this, do you? - Sure, it's what hankies were made for. It eases sneezes and clears tears. - You're the only person I ever met who really carried a handkerchief. Except my mother. Here, I just couldn't. That's what sleeves are for. Thanks, anyway. - I was watching you guys play basketball. Nice elbow. I think you caught him a little off guard. - Oh, me too. I don't know what happened. One second I felt like crying and the next thing I knew my elbow just flew into his eye. - I don't think he does either. - Lately my head will say one thing and my body will ends up doing something completely different. - It's an emotional response. Often triggered by sugar, anger, or good looking boys. - Legget? Good looking? - I thought he was kind of cute. - Maybe, I never really thought about it before. - Uh-huh. - OK, maybe a little bit. For a blockhead. Do you go to Memorial High? I don't remember seeing you around. - No, I'm kind of new here. Well, sort of. I used to live here. - Oh, well things don't change much around here. - Oh, things rarely change. But we do. - Yeah, I know. - I'm RJ. - Destiny. - Nice to know you, Desi. - Well, I got to go. Thanks. Hey, how did you know everybody calls me Desi? (ethereal music) (vocalizing) (doorbell chiming) - Yes? - Oh, hi there. Cam? - Excuse me. - Cameron. - Lady you better start explaining. You can't just walk in here-- - I know you're in there. They went for it. Spycat's going to be syndicated nationwide. - Syndication, Peyton, you're amazing! - Oh, I agree, I agree, I agree! - Oh, excuse me, Peyton. This is Miss Morningside. - Oh, we met, Cam. - Charming. - They want to start with next week's strip. - Next week's strip? Well, that's no problem, it's almost finished. - Oh, excellent. And I can't wait to tell you about the changes. - Changes? - Oh, minor, small, tiny, subtle shadings, you know? - Well, Peyton, I don't know about changes. - Shh. Nothing to worry about. - Dad. - Desi. - Desi, what an interesting look. - What happened to you? - Nothing, I was shooting baskets. I got into a little scuffle with Legget, that's all. - What, what do you mean scuffle? - I elbowed him in the eye. - Darling, that only works in kindergarten. If you want a boy's attention-- - I didn't want his attention. I wanted to beat him. - Desi, I don't want you fighting with boys. - It was an accident, Dad. - Yeah, well, we'll talk about that later. Peyton and I have some business to discuss. Now she's gonna be joining us for dinner so why don't you go upstairs, get cleaned up and look presentable. - Oh, joy. - Oh, I know you must look perfectly adorable when you want to. - Yeah, adorable. I'll see if I can find something pink. Better yet, mesh. - Desi. Oh, I don't know, she's at that age. Whatever that means. - Maybe, I should have a talk with her. You know, girl talk. Maybe take her shopping. - Oh, well, Peyton, I couldn't ask you to do that. - Oh, no, I'd love to. Really. - Oh, well, now that you mention it. Maybe a female influence would be helpful. - Great then. Now, I'll go talk to Miss Morningbreath about tonight's-- - Morningside, Miss Morningside. - Right, right, Morningside. I'll go talk to her about tonight's menu. - Wait Peyton, I wanted to talk to you about those changes. - Oh, tomorrow, darling. Tomorrow, I promise. (Cameron stammering) (contemplative music) - Get used to it, honey. Eventually it'll be an asset. - Oh, Morningside, what am I gonna do. Everything is so strange. My friends are acting weird. Legget looks at me like I'm from another planet. And I feel different. - That's because you are different. You're growing up. - I don't Want to grow up. - Oh, you will, dear. Look how beautiful you are. - How come I don't feel so beautiful right now? - Don't worry, you will, I promise. - What do I do in the meantime? - Destiny. If you wanna see a rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain. (sultry music) Can I help you with something? - Yes, are those free-range chickens? - Nope, they go for about $4 a pound. - Right, it's a good thing I caught you in time. - In time for what? - The menu for tonight's dinner. I've offered to handle things while Mr. Brooks is working on some last minute changes. - I have dinner planned. - Oh, I'm sorry Miss, whatever. But we're gonna have to cancel that. - There's a 13 year old girl in this house that's gonna turn up her nose at this stuff. Radicchio? - Well, I think it's just about time that Desi started behaving like an adult. She cannot be adorable little Desi there rest of her life. And part of being an adult is eating adult foods. See the connection? - Well, maybe I'm blind, because I don't see any connection between Radicchio and a 13 year old girl. - I'm sorry. Besides, everything on that menu is 99% fat free. - Sounds delicious. - Dinner, promptly at eight. - Connection, I'll show you connection, blondie. (cleaver pounding) - Hey, Des, come here. You know, I realize it's been a long time since you've gone out and bought anything new. Your birthday's coming up and Gaynor's party's in a few days. - How do you know about Gaynor's party? - Oh, I, uh, found the invitation on the staircase. It says you have to bring a boy? Well, anyway, Peyton wants to take you out shopping as your birthday present. She wants you to look nice for your party. - How's Saturday? - Well, great. Hey look, take my credit card, buy something pretty. And have a great time. OK? - Shopping? Buy something pretty? (Desi sighing) - Jake? Mabel. Listen, what in tarnation is a free-range chicken? And why in the Sam Hill are they so expensive? Yeah, yeah, right. You mean to tell me they roam around free and eat what they can find and I have to pay more for their bohemian lifestyle? I don't know, Jake. Sounds like a bum deal to me. Yeah, Jake, listen, do me a favor. Take two regular stupid chickens and wrap them up in a free-range package and send them over. Yeah, Jake, like my father always said, a chicken without feathers is still bald. Think about it. - OK, there's this girl in my class. She thinks she's all a valley girl, I think she really is. But she. - She thinks she is? Oh my god. - She's all, she said, I don't accept that serve to me when I was playing handball with her. - Playing handball? (talking over each other) - [Girl] Valley girl doing playing handball. - I know, she goes, she goes. - She's such a wannabe. - She goes, "I don't accept that serve." And I go "I don't care, get off the court." - You should go, I don't accept you. Go I don't accept you. (melancholy music) - Desi? Is everything OK? - Yeah, Dad. Everything's peachy. - Well, if there was ever anything that you wanna talk about. - I'm fine, Dad. - Yeah, hey, you know if you'd feel more comfortable, maybe you could talk to Peyton. - Pass. Just forget about it, Dad. - You know, Desi, she's a very nice lady. I wish you two could be friends. - Why? - Why? Because we work together. She's gonna be spending a lot of time working with me on "Spycat." Look, Desi. With her help everything is gonna change. We won't have to move out of this house. It would be easier, more comfortable if you two could just get along. - Do you like her? - Yes, of course. - Do you think she's pretty. - I, uh, I think she's very attractive. - She's staying for dinner again? - Possibly, if we work late. Is that a problem? - If that's what you want, Dad. Why couldn't we just stay that way forever? - May I help you? - I'm just looking. - Perhaps if I knew what you were looking for. - I'm not exactly sure. - I believe you'd be more comfortable with the athletic store upstairs. - Maybe you're right. (gentle piano music) - I like this one. The diamond is exquisite. - It looks good on you. But then again, anything does. - Oh, Derrick, you say the sweetest things. - Do you really think this chump's gonna buy you this ring? - I've got him wrapped around my finger. Just like this. - How much longer is this gonna take? - Soon we're going to be rich. Just as soon as I can convince Cameron to change his insipid little cartoon we will be rolling in dough. I figure he'll ask me to marry him within six months. I'll divorce him within eight and start collecting alimony in Tahiti by nine. (Peyton laughing) - I love your mind. - Now, if I can just figure out a way to get rid of that bratty little kid. - [Derrick] Come here. (contemplative music) (ethereal music) - [RJ] Hi, Desi. - Hi. - I didn't see you at the park today. - No, didn't feel much like basketball. - I saw Legget at the basketball court. He's got quite a shiner. - I guess I should feel kind of guilty about that, but. - But you don't? - I don't know what I feel. I want to apologize, but whenever I see him I just feel like smacking him. - I think boys have that same effect on girls your age. I know, I felt the same way. - How old are you? - What would you guess? - 16 or 17. - Good guess. - You're so pretty I don't see why boys wouldn't automatically like you. - What makes you think boys don't like you? - Look at me. - You should have seen me at your age. I was taller than all the other girls, all arms and legs. All I had to do was look at French fries and my skin would break out. My hair was frizzy when it rained and like a dishrag when it was hot. I was clumsy, self-conscious, nothing fit right. And what's more, I was sure boys were staring at me for all the wrong reasons. - But, it seems so easy for Gaynor and Pleasance. We used to be best friends, but now all they like are clothes and hanging out at the mall. All they ever talk about are boys. - Everyone has to come into their own in their own time. It's just their turn now. Look. Everyone has a perfect age when everything changes. You wake up one morning, you look in the mirror and you see the best you. When everything has caught up with everything else. - I just can't believe that I could ever be anything like you and I just can't ever imagine ever wanting to hang out at the mall. - You don't have to like those things. And you don't have to give up the things you love. Play basketball 'til you're a hundred if it makes you happy. - But it's a hard to imagine any boy wanting to spend time with a point guard. - If you're honest about who you are people will start to see you as special. Especially boys. - My mother was very beautiful. She always loved being outdoors and riding bicycles. Oh no. - What? - Peyton. My father's agent. - You don't like her? - What's to like. I keep wanting to scratch off that plastic layer to see what's underneath but I'm afraid some gooey green monster wearing bright pink lipstick is gonna ooze out all over the ground and ruin the lawn. I think my father likes her. I don't trust her. I think she's up to something. - Really? (car alarm wailing) (Peyton screams) (girls laughing) - Would you stay for dinner? - Oh, I don't know. - Please. Come on, I always feel outnumbered. At least there'd be someone to talk to instead of watching my father and Peyton make goo-goo eyes at each other. - I'd love to. - Great, let's go around back. I'll show you my room. - Now, this is what I came with. This new character, per your suggestions of course, which were very imaginative. Now, it's a just preliminary you understand. - They're fabulous. Exactly what I had in mind. Oh, I just love Dumb Dog. - Yeah, well I guess I kinda warmed up to the idea. - I still think there's something missing. - Missing? I thought the addition of Dumb Dog was-- - I still think it needs something bold. Something powerful. Something je ne sais quois. I've got it. - What? - Why don't you have a panel showing Spycat pushing Dumb Dog into a gigantic cheese grater? - A cheese grater? - The distributors are gonna love it. The eternal struggle between cats and dogs. Think about the conflict, think about the triumph. Think about the sales. You're on the edge of greatness. Children will be reading "Spycat" from Los Angeles to New York. We make a great team, Cameron. - You think? - I know. (clears throat) - Daddy, this is my friend RJ. Can she please stay for dinner? - Sure. Nice to meet you RJ. - Nice to meet you too, sir. Ma'am. - That's Peyton. - Girls. - And, uh, you are. - Very funny, Dad. I hope you have the same sense of humor when report cards come out. - Well, I was about to say the same thing to you. (phone rings) You girls go ahead, I'll be right in. No, go ahead with the girls, I'll be right there. "Spycat." - Ah. So, Desi, darling. Disguising yourself as a girl to avoid any further scuffle with the opposite sex? - You know, you have the most beautiful blond hair I've seen in a while. - Why thank you, darling. I do admit it is luxurious. - Do you mind if I ask what shade that is? - Oh, my dear, this is my natural color. - Oh, I'm so sorry. I saw the dark roots and just assumed it was dyed. Please forgive me. - [Cameron] Well, sorry to keep everyone waiting. So, RJ, where are you from? - My family's from all over the Pacific Northwest, but I grew up in Montana. - Really, well, my wife, Desi's mother was from Montana. Actually, that's where I met Regan, my wife. She, uh was bicycling along a dirt road and I was driving on my way to a business meeting. All of a sudden I hit this huge mud puddle and blew a tire. Well, it scared her so much she fell off the bike. She was all covered with mud. And I went over to try to help her. All I did was make it worse. But before I could even speak she looked up at me with these big beautiful brown eyes. I fell in love like that. Oh, well. (all laughing) I guess got a little carried away. Don't mean to bore you with old sentiment. - Oh, I love hearing that story. But Mom told a slightly different tale. - Oh, I'm sure that's true. - Will someone please pass the mashed potatoes? I don't see what's so romantic about the mud. (Peyton screaming) (Peyton screaming) Oh, my dress. - My salad. - A little dressing with that. (Peyton screaming) - Who did that? Who did that? - Would you like me to get you some Club Soda? (Peyton screaming) - Peyton. You guys, come on. (all laughing) - Like my father always said, what goes around comes around is better served up with mashed potatoes. Think about it. (girls laughing) (Melanie chuckling) (bell rings) (bus rumbling) - Desi, Desi, where have you been? I've been calling you for three days. - I've been around. - I need you to give this to Tyler for me. - Why me? - Because I'm being coy, dummy. - Hey, Desi. Peyton wants to show me a condo she found. You girls want to come? - Condo, what condo? - Is this your car? Come on, Desi. Let's go for a ride in the Jag. Definitely, Mr. Brooks. - OK, let's go. - [Gaynor] Great car. - Thanks. Is this a fabulous view or what? - Unbelievable. - Cameron, look at this perfect morning light. And everyone who's anyone lives here. - Looks great. Can you afford this? - Me? - Wow, I think this is Greek marble. Greek marble is the best. My mom says so. - Really? - Look, darling. It's partly furnished. - You mean you want me to buy this place? - Well, of course. You need a place like this to promote the image of a successful artist. An image I'm working so very hard to build for you. - Well, but, but, this place doesn't even have a bedroom. (Peyton laughs) (bed booming) - Voila. You sleep here. And they even have daily maid service so you can get rid of Miss Morningface. - Morningside. And what about Desi. - With the kind of money you'll be making you can afford to send her to the best private schools in this country. Or Switzerland. - Switzerland? - Come on, Desi. Let's go check out the pool. There might be some cute boys up there. - No, I don't want to. - Come on, Desi. - Gaynor, can you just hold off on chasing boys for like two seconds. - I'm just doing it for you. You know, everyone's saying how you can't find a boy to take to my party. Frankly, you're embarrassing me. - Is that so? - Come on. - But Peyton, I can't take Desi away from her school and all of her friends. - I told you not to say anything 'til you've seen the whole thing. Wait 'til you see the bathroom. Well, what do you think? - Well, maybe living here wouldn't be so bad after all. - Wow, you can see the mall from here. - I've never seen a pool on a roof before. - Hi. - Hi. - Are you moving in? - No, but my friend here might be. - You're kidding? - No, really. - Can your family afford it? - My father's an artist. - Artist's don't have any money. - He does a comic strip called "Spycat." Have you seen it? - We don't read comics. (bluesy jazz music) (water splashing) - Just think about the condo. But don't take too long. I have them at an advantage. It's now a buyers market with lower capital gains tax. (jazzy piano music) - Yeah, give me the meat department. (humming) Yeah, Jake, it's Mabel. Give me four pounds ground round, one pound bacon, lean. Oh yeah, and another one of those briskets. Mr. Brooks really liked it. Yeah, wrap it up and put it on my account. Yeah, I know it's overdue. How long have you been my butcher? And you've always gotten paid haven't you? Well, then wrap it up and I'll see you this afternoon. Oh, and remember, Jake, people in need are people indeed. Think about it. (ball bouncing) - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, that was traveling. - Come on, Dad, they never call traveling now days. - Oh yeah, since when? - [Desi] Since the last time you played, maybe. Get with it, Dad. - [Cameron] Oh yeah. (magical twinkling) (net rustling) - [Desi] Nice shot. - [Cameron] My ball. - New rules, Dad. - Hey, hey, hey, no way, my house, my rules. So, what did you think about the condo? Yeah, I thought so. Probably think the same thing about the new changes in "Spycat," huh? Hey, come here. I know I'm not any good at this. Not like your mother would have been, but you're a young woman now. We can always talk. I don't know, sometimes I, I think you and I are drifting apart. Hey, you know what? I think I miss her laugh more than anything. No matter how badly I felt, gosh I miss her laugh. - I miss her singing. - Oh, yeah, exactly. Whenever we'd hear her sing, it'd always cheer us up. - I miss her, Dad. (Cameron sighing) - I do too. Come on. Hey, I love you, Des. - I love you too, Daddy. - Don't stay up too late, huh? - OK, Daddy. Daddy. (contemplative music) (phone rings) - Hello, Brooks residence. Yeah, who is this? Jake the Butcher. Yeah, I'm sorry. You got the wrong number. Think about it. (insects chirping) (contemplative piano music) - Oh, no. What do I do? What do I do? (Desi sighing) No guts, no glory. Hey, Tyler? Tyler! - Not now. Can't you see, I'm trying to school this little punk. - Sorry. Suit yourself. Hey, Legget. - Hey. I don't think I want to play with you anymore. - I, I know, I'm really, really sorry about your eye. - Oh, that's OK. You play tough. - So have you heard about Gaynor's party? - Yeah, Tyler told me about it. He's pretty steamed Gaynor hasn't asked him yet. - No kidding. So, um, you think, maybe, do you think you might want to, I mean. - Hi, Perry. - Hi, Pleasance. - My mom said she'd take us to the party if that's OK with you. - Sure, whatever. - Hi, Desi. - Hi, Pleasance. - Want to go to Eleven? (car horn honks) - I, I. (horn honking) I gotta go. - Yeah, see you. - I promised your father I'd take you shopping. Get in. Listen, Desi. I think we got off to a bad start. So, let's just set the record straight. I'm here to help your father. He's on the verge of becoming an incredible success. Which is good for both me and you. The only thing that stands in the way of his success is your approval. He feels you're unhappy with the changes going on in his life. So, having said that, let me put it to you this way. Those changes will be made with or without your help. It might take longer, but the end result will be the same. I knew there was a smart little girl hiding under that baseball cap someplace. Now let's get that shopping thing done with. (bluesy rock music) Hello, hello? - Well, I hope you had fun and I hope I still have credit left. - We have transformed your daughter into a fashion plate. It was a rousing success. Wasn't it, Desi? - Yes. - You may want to let this cool off before you put it in your wallet. - Well, if it makes Desi happy, I'm sure it's well worth it. - Happy? Of course she's happy. - Now may I please go upstairs? - Yeah, sure. - You've got some kid there. Well, I'm off. I've got a million things to do. I'm putting in your bid on the condo. I'll be back later for the unveiling. I promised the girls I'd drive them to the party in the Jaguar. Their friends will be green with envy. Bye now! - [RJ] Desi, Desi, are you there? (contemplative music) - Oh, come on up. Just wait until I tell you about my plan. The only thing I'm worried about is if my dad would like me better this way. Sure seems to like Peyton the way she is. - Your father is caught up in a place that says you have to be a certain way and act a certain way in order to be successful. He doesn't see things the way they really are. He means well. And he really is only thinking of you. But right now, all he can see is the shine on the apple. But you are gonna help him clear the fog. And get a real good look at things to come if they're left in certain hands. If you know what I mean. (tire hissing) (Peyton groans) (phone rings) - Hello, Brooks residence. Who's calling? Clayton, oh, excuse me, Peyton. One moment please. - [Peyton] Cameron, Cameron? - [Desi] Where are they? - I don't know. Miss Morningside? Mr. Brooks. Hold on a second, Desi. Miss Morningside must have gone to the market. Oh, this might explain it. (jazzy piano music) - [Desi] What's going on? - Desi, Peyton called, had a flat tire, asked me to pick her up. Sit tight, we'll be back very shortly to give you a ride to the party, love, Dad. - Of course she calls my father instead of a garage. - Wait, I have an idea. Do you have a camera? - Yeah, in the closet. - Say cheese. - Cheese. Let me write the note. Great idea RJ, this ought to shake things up a bit more. - Oh, but where are you going? - Well, I wouldn't go to the party like this. - Of course. Let me help you. - I think the number for the garage is by the phone in the kitchen. Just let me see if Desi's ready. What? "Daddy, wanted to surprise you "with the new things Peyton bought me, but it got late. "So I hitched a ride to the party. "I'll see you when I get home but don't wait up. Left a picture. "Tell Peyton I said thanks. Bye, for now, Desi." Hitched a ride? Don't wait up? (dramatic music) Peyton! Peyton! - What on earth are you screaming about? - What have you done? Are you out of your mind? - Cameron, you're scaring me. What are you talking about? - This, I am talking about this! - Oh, black really isn't her color. (Cameron exclaiming) Cameron, calm down. You're raving. Look, what's the problem? For the first time in her dreary little life she's showing some promise. - Desi is a 13 year old girl. - Well, I happen to like those clothes. - We are gonna find my baby girl and you are gonna put her back just the way you found her. Do you understand me? - She was gonna go with that boy, Legget. Maybe she got a ride with him. - A ride? A boy? She's with a boy and she's dressed like this? You! Move! - [Peyton] Cameron, please, everything is going to be just fine. (girls laughing) - I think it worked. - Your father sounded pretty upset. - You think? Wait, they went to Gaynor's to look for me. We have to find them before he does something crazy. - What is this? (playful tone) Good heavens, my baby!

I was so worried about you. It's all my fault. - Hey, hey. It's not your fault. It's mine. I had some time to think about things. Next to a guy named Spider. - Daddy. Peyton didn't put me up to this. I did it myself. I'll apologize. - Oh, hey, hey, hey. It's all right, you don't have to apologize. Somewhere, sometime last night I, I got a really good look at Peyton and I didn't much like what I saw. When I saw that picture of you I saw Peyton rubbing off on our lives. And I saw something I truly loved being spoiled by some illusion. You know what's even worse? I got a real good picture of myself. I liked that even less. Hey, look, baby, I'm sorry. I want you to be the beautiful girl that you've always been. I want you to be the best you possible. Don't you change for anybody. Come here. You want to know something else. I don't wanna change where we live. And I don't want to change "Spycat." I don't want anything to change. - But, how are we gonna be-- - Hey. You let me worry about the house. I think you and me, we've got to stick with what works, huh? - Me do. (Cameron chuckles) - [RJ Voiceover] Dear, Destiny. I'm sorry I couldn't stay for your party, but I had to go. You are your perfect age. Everything will fall into place and the world will start to make a little more sense. Believe in yourself, trust in your own feelings and remember that you are beautiful. And special and very much loved. You own that and no one can ever take that away from you. With all my heart, love RJ. - Isn't this neat? My mom wrapped it. - Beautiful job. Your mom's a regular artist. - Hey, Brooks. - Hey, Legget. - You look really-- - Don't even go there. Where's Dad? - He just got an important phone call. - Hey, guys, guys, great news! You'll never guess what just happened. I just got a call from a big publishing house in New York. They want "Spycat." We're gonna be nationally syndicated and we got our own comic book. (all cheering) - [Desi] Does that mean we don't-- - Yep. We don't have to sell the house. (camera clicking) I just wish your mother could see you. She'd be so proud of you. - She can, Daddy. She really can. - OK, one more shot, all three of you. Go on. Ready, smile, say cheese. - [All] Cheese! - OK, this calls for a big celebration. Come on! (bright music) - Here, here. We're not brooding are we? - No, not brooding. Just thinking. - You should be happy with the way things turned out. I think you did a wonderful job. Although, you did take too many, shall we say, heavenly liberties. Don't worry. It'll be our little secret. I love the cake. Nice touch. - Thanks. And thank you so much for allowing me to help my family. - It's just that it's so hard to leave them. To let go. - You don't have to let go. There's a part of you that will always be there.
