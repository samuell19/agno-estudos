Get up. - Don't fucking move. - Hey, watch them. - We got this. Your money is federally insured, but that's not what we're here for, so sit down, shut up, and it will be over in a minute, okay? - You will never be able to get in there. You need two different keys to open the safe deposit box. - I got my own key, box three. (drill drilling) - Freeze. Lower your weapon. (gun fires) (crowd screaming) - I hear one more word out of y'all, I'ma start shooting, try me. - Do you wanna be next? - Please, please, don't shoot me. - Hey, Ms. Chanel, you good? - I'm good. - He good? - He good. The bullet didn't go through his vest, with his lucky ass. - Ms. Louie, y'all got that bag? - We got that bag! (dramatic music) - How we looking? - So far, so good. - I don't see anything so we should be straight. - So, let's see what's inside this safe deposit box. - Oh, no, this mine right here. - Not much cash in here though. Like 250, maybe three. - Benny said, "It should be more than cash in there." (coins clink) So, I guess he was talking about these gold coins. (coins clink) I wonder how much these are even worth. - And they look rare. They're definitely worth some cheese. (coin clinks) Hey, what's this? A flash drive? I wonder what's on this. - Probably, some kiddie porn or some shit. You know rich people be into all kind of wild shit. Look at this gold 45! - [Dee] No telling, man. Aye, we got a laptop here, don't we? - Yeah, I got one. I just gotta charge it up. - All right, I'll just check this later. - What's this? Crew, look. Look at these. - Oh my God! - Diamonds are forever - Bitch, let me see them! Let me see them. - Here, girl. - Shit. Bro. Aye, who's box did we hit? - I don't even know. Benny said, "It was some drug dealer from North Florida." Nobody we would be familiar with. - A hustler hiding cash, coins and diamonds in Detroit? Nah, that ain't the normal dealer. - I mean, it's hard to hide millions of dollars in cash. I mean, sometimes, you gotta convert the cash into smaller valuable items. There's nothing more valuable than diamonds. - Aye, man, I think this might be the biggest lick we ever hit. - For real. (waves crashing) - Daisy, you ready? - Gimme a minute to change with your little nasty ass. - I'm serious. It's my first time meeting him, and I wanna make a good impression. (Daisy scoffing) - Internet dating. I'm only going so he don't kill your ass. (soft music) Waiter, can I get a vodka and cranberry? Thank you. - Crystal. Look, you're even prettier in person.

How are you? - Yeah, I'm good. I was caught up a little bit earlier. What that bag look like? - Good as hell. 300 in cash, some gold coins, something real special. Take a look at the pic. - Damn, them some big shiny rocks. How many of them is it? - [Nola] 20 of them? You got a buyer in mind? - A couple Jewish dudes I can reach out to. Don't worry, they getting sold. When y'all leaving out? - We're ready and packed. First thing in the morning, we're hitting the road. - All right, cool. Send me a pic of them coins too, front and back. I'll have my Jewish guy working on a quote for them and them stones. Good job, my baby. Now, whose safety deposit box you had the info on? (dramatic music) - Polo has arrived. Shall I tell him you'll be down shortly? - No send him in. - As you wish. - Polo, you may come up. (footsteps thudding) - Polo, what are you doing in my house at this time of night? The business we conduct keeps me tight. I need this time to relax, so I can prepare for whatever wretchedness, the next business day beholds. - Well, Soleraa, you're getting your dose of wretchedness tonight. - What is it? - One of the boxes got hit today. One of the special ones. - Which box, Polo? - The one in Michigan. - And what was the particular contents of this box, Polo? - 300 cash, about 100 in gold coin, a couple of hard drives and- - Spit it out. - It was close to a $1,000,000 of diamonds in that box, that's not the worst of it. On those hard drives, we keep a copy of all the main trafficking routes, stash houses, and the names and badge numbers of all the dirty cops on our payroll. - $1.4 million gone. - [Polo] That's it. - Our chain of distribution compromised. - There's a possibility things can be slowed down for a minute. - Polo, get back those hard drives. Get my money, find my diamonds, and then I want you to kill whoever the fuck stole them. - I'm on it. I've already alerted anybody that can make a play for those diamonds. It's gonna be hard to move them. Hopefully, they don't figure out what's on those hard drives. We can get them back in our possession as soon as possible. - Hopefully, for them and for you. - Jefa, one last thing, your father's gold Desert Eagle was in that box also. - My father's gold pistol? (birds chirping) - Soleraa, let me show you how we deal with cockroaches in this family. - Boss, it wasn't me, I swear, boss, it wasn't me, I swear. - How dare you steal from the hand that feeds you? - Boss, boss, it wasn't me, it wasn't me. - The hand that feeds your fat ass wife, your three dumb kids, how dare you? - Boss, boss, boss. I swear, boss, it wasn't me. Boss, I swear, I swear it wasn't me. (gun fires) - Soleraa, listen to me, never steal, never cheat, but never ever lie. You understand this, baby? - Yes father. - Okay. (gun firing) Give me that. Why did you do this? - Because you stomp the cockroach, not step on it father. - Let's go get ice cream. - Get back my gun. (footsteps thudding) (car engine roars) - All right, so we should be back in four days. - Well, I already got us hotel rooms booked in Atlanta. We'll spend a couple of nights there, and then we'll drive the rest of the way. It'll only be about 11 or 12-hour drive. - I got a home girl I used to go to school with that live in ATL. I'ma try to link up with her. - Cool. - I had a long night, y'all. I'ma get all my rest on this road trip. - All right, well we ready to go. So did you end up near some D last night? (all laughing) - [Crystal] I did. (gentle music) - Damn. Hey, y'all see this video? I saw it on the Crimes In Detroit IG page. Check the security officer get smoked. - Shit! Jesus! - Should have just scanned the room, or just sliced the pie. He would've caught the shooter coming right up from behind. - Right. - That's the difference between being a rented cop and a real cop, I guess, training. What'd you think, Lewis? - Well, how about training and arrogance? What do you think? - I don't know about arrogance, but for sure training. Take a look at it. - Let me see. Hey, Herd. - Mm-hmm. - You remember about a year ago, we got a call to investigate the drive-by shooting of the four girls. The girls driving a Bentley. - Of course, how could I forget? They were pretty. (Herd chuckles) Let's see, we did our interviews, and we wrote it up as an extreme case of road rage. Why are you bringing that up? - Look, it's four women robbing this bank, and they're wearing the same outfits, the four girls were wearing whose car got shot up that night. - Let me see that. Lewis, this is in Detroit not Miami, besides my niece got that same black outfit. Don't you think you're reaching a bit, Lewis? - I'm not so sure. I'm not so sure. (gentle music) - I'm about to go slide by Kitty house and kick it with her for a minute. Do you wanna ride with me? - Nah, go ahead, baby. Y'all got some catching up to do anyway. Go ahead and do your thing. And besides, I'm about to enjoy this bed and call my baby, and let him know we made it safe. - All right, I'ma ask Crystal or Daisy to see. Tell Damon I said, "Hey." - [Nola] I will. - All right, girl. - Bye. Don't be too bad. (door thuds) Hi, baby. - Hey, babe, what's going on? - I just wanted to call you, and let you know we made it slow and safe. I miss you, and I love you. - Aw. I'm missing and loving you too. So, I'm glad y'all made it to the A safe and sound, but tell me about Detroit. I been hearing some crazy stuff, how is it? - Yeah, it was nice. We went Downtown, and they actually have their own little islands. You gotta take the bridge to get to it, and there's this real pretty place called Belle Isle. You remember the movie "8 Mile?" Forget "8 Mile," "7 Mile" is where the real hustle was at, and they got their own little say on how they greet each other too. - Oh yeah, what's that? - What up doe? - What up doe? (Damon chuckles) Okay, that's way different. I never heard that before, okay? But, so what's going on with, did Dee get to take care of that business y'all went up there for? - Yeah, yeah, she did. They got some real nice homes there too. Definitely, cheaper than Miami. Yeah, we visited a mortgage institution there too. We made a withdrawal. - Teller, put your hands in the air. Everybody, now get on the ground. - And met some real cool people there. - All right, that's what's up. Look babe, you know I'm missing your face though. You know, why don't you send me a couple of pics real quick. - No problem, baby. All right, let me take a couple pictures for you right now. I'll send them to you and call you back. - All right, cool. All right. (upbeat music) (camera shutter clicking) Mmm. Okay. (upbeat music) (camera shutter clicking) I like this one. (upbeat music) (camera shutter clicking) Damn. Okay. Damn, girl. (upbeat music) (Dee and Kitty laugh) - Girl, how you been doing? - I've been good, girl. - It's been too long. - [Dee] I know. - So what you been up to. - Since the divorce been finalized, me and my homegirls, we started us a business. Then, you know, I bought me some rental properties, but other than that, dating has been taking all my time. - Okay sis, I see you. (fingers snapping) You always had that entrepreneurial spirit. I know having tenants cannot be easy, but you cannot beat real estate when it comes to building that wealth. So, what kind of business did you start? - Oh girl, nothing important, nothing that you really wanna hear about. - Girl, I'm serious. I'm proud of you. Tell me. - Okay, well, me and my home girls, see, we pilfer drug dealers when they getting they cash on their drug deals, then we, you know, we free them of any assets that the known criminals have. See, we get help from an advisor that we have. We set them up, we find them, because they be having these real envious partners, you feel me? So, girl. (both laugh) Girl, I got you. - Girl, you always been crazy. You had me going for a second though. - I was serious. - Huh? - Got you again, girl. (both laugh) - Oh stop it, stop it. How long you got to be in Atlanta for? - For like the next two days, and then we back on our road, back to Miami, girl. - Okay, well look, if you and your girls wanna hit up a party while you here, there's one tomorrow night. - Who party is this? - That's King T's white party. - Who is King T? - Just a local rapper who was blowing up on the underground hip hop scene. He throws the livest parties in Georgia, and his white parties are epic. They're special invite only, strictly for the movers and shakers in the city. - A rapper. You know, if he do anything else? - I mean, you ain't hear this from me, but he has been known to get them things in from out of town. You know, them white things. Why do you ask? - 'Cause we gonna rob him, (Dee laughs) Got you again, girl. (Kitty laughs) - You are so much, girl. You are too much, (Kitty laughs) I swear. - You mind if I take a picture of this, me and my home girls might slide through. - Yeah, yeah. (indistinct) "We're gonna rob him," you're crazy. - We're gonna rob him, girl. See at first, I ain't know what these random names or addresses was on them flash drives, but after I seen that invite, it all popped in my head. - What popped in your head, cuz? - Look, let's look at this Detroit file real quick. When I open it, it's random names in it, and it's about three different addresses. - And? - And, one of the addresses is to the bank that we hit. It got the safety deposit box number on it and everything. - So, what's these other addresses and names with the numbers next to them mean? - See, I don't got all that figured out yet, but what I can see, is look at the Atlanta folder. It's another series of names, and it's a couple of addresses on here too. - So? - So, when I seen this invitation that my home girl showed me, the address to the party is the address on the flash drive. It got me to thinking. - So you think it might be another bag waiting for us at this party? - Exactly. - Now, usually, we already gotten intel on the operation on how the licks move. Don't y'all think we move it a little too fast on getting the bag without Benny's help? - [Daisy] Man. - Man, fuck Benny. We the bag girls, we run this shit. If he a dope dealer, then we on him. - Right. - We're only here for a couple more days, we can go to the party, have a ball and leave the next day. But if the opportunity arises- - We already got the heat in the back of the jeep. - Bingo. (gentle music) - Welcome ladies, invite please. - Hi, I'm Kitty Black, personal assistant to Mayor Jackson and these are my plus ones. - Four plus ones? - [Kitty] Uh-huh. - Man, chill with that. Look at these fine ass women. Come on in, enjoy the party. - [Kitty] Thank you. - [Man] Enjoy ladies. (upbeat music) (bottle pops) (all cheering) - Yes, yes. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Yeah, once again, I am truly humbled to see all you beautiful people that have come here and chosen to spend your night with me tonight. And for you, and to you, and for that, I salute.

That's a lot of money. Your sister ain't got you swinging on no poles like she do when y'all go out of town, does she? - Nana, no. I'm not swinging on any poles, and neither is Nola. I mean, not no more. But when she was, it was okay. She took care of herself and she didn't need nobody for nothing. - Mmm. So where's all this money coming from all of a sudden, huh? Did y'all run an unemployment scam? - No, we just help our friend with- - Listen, I don't even wanna hear no lie. Instead of buying this baby all these toys, and baby Fendi clothes and stuff, you better make sure you have at least four years worth of college money stored up for her somewhere. 'Cause if anything ever happen to you, it'd be a real shame for me to have to send her to college on my social security checks. - Nana, stop, stop. Please, stop talking about death. No one is about to die. - I ain't the one talking about death, that's your baby. (gentle music) - Damn, this little coin heavy, probably, solid gold and rarest shit. How many of these we got? - 30. - 30? - Mm-hmm. - Damn, that's good, good. And where that diamond at? - I got you right here. Here you go. - It's even bigger in person than it is on picture. How many of these we have again? - 20. - 30 coins, 20 stones, cool. I'm hooking with my Jewish jewelry in a couple of days. You know, if these things worth what they look like they worth, it's gonna be the lick of the year. - I know right, we need that. - I'ma hold on to these two, and get out to you later. - Hit me with the info. - For sure. - We'll talk later. - Great job on that. - Thank you. (soft music) - Antwon. - Sit your ass down. - Why you gotta be so motherfucking ignorant? - What did I do, Antwon? - Hey, see that's the shit I'm talking about. How are you gonna come at my place of business, talking all loud and shit calling me motherfucking Twon. - Look, that's what we used to call you when you were little. - Okay, I ain't little no more. Just don't want nobody call me that no more. - Okay nigga, relax. - Now, what can I do for you, Daisy? - Now, you know I've been copping from you, for like a year or so. - Yeah and? - And the deals you've been giving me on them, they're real sweet. You got good product. - You only get them deals because we go way back. - Yeah, and I appreciate that, but I ain't trying to be a four or five brick popping bitch anymore. - So what the fuck is you trying to say now? - I got real money coming, listen. (Herd sighs) - You know what, Lewis? One of the worst feelings in the world is sitting in the parking lot of a strip club, watching all these fine ass dancers go into work, while we just sitting here in the car, not going into the club, getting lap dances. - Control yourself, Herd. - Lewis, I mean it. I mean, remind why we're here again? Because I ain't see nothing about no strip club on my docket today. - I'm doing my own investigation into a certain matter. - Well, I would like to go investigate those titties, but let me guess, you're talking about the four girls and the drive-by/road rage incident again, right? Man, you gotta let that go. - No. Nope, I just can't. - [Herd] Yes, you can. - No, I can't. Their story just didn't sit right with me then. And then the video of the bank robbery in Detroit, man, it's just too much of a coincidence if you ask me. - [Herd] Well, nobody's asking you, Lewis. - Shut up, Herd. - [Herd] Just saying. - Hey, come on, let's go talk to her. Let's go inside, come on. - All right, I wanna do more than just talking. (muffled rap music) - Hey! - What the fuck! - Shut your face. - What? - Look, I'm Detective Lewis, this my partner, Detective Herd. - What's up? - We just got a few questions to ask you about the robbery and shooting you were involved in about a year ago. - Oh my God, this shit again? - It's just a few questions, but you're Charlotte Williams, correct? - Yeah. - You were assaulted during the robbery, correct? - Yeah, I was assaulted, but obviously, I'm in the middle of something, so is this gonna take a long time or- - Look, I'm almost done. When you gave your statement, you couldn't give a description then, but if I showed you a picture of the suspects, you think maybe it could drag your memory a little bit? - Maybe. - Take a look. - Yeah, that's them. - Wait, wait a minute. Are you sure? - I'm sure. They was here that night. I was cleaning up, Sharbliss was dancing for Jimmy. - Jimmy Wilson, he was one of the guys, doing security that night. He was assaulted too? - Yeah, he was assaulted. They fucked Jimmy up. They split his head open to the white meat. - Continue, please. - Like I said, I was cleaning up, Sharbliss was dancing for Jimmy, I looked away for two seconds maybe. I look back, I get punched in the face. I'm knocked clean the fuck out. I wake up tied up, behind the bar with Jimmy, and the other bouncer that was working here that night. That's really all I remember. - So, you don't know who shot and robbed the bar owner, Vincent Gravy? - No, but I do remember the bitch that hit me. She had some long, pretty nails. You know what I'm saying? Like a stripper. Y'all gonna pay me some money for this? (Herd laughs) - Ain't nobody paying you for this information, but we could do a little something special in the VIP room, if you know what I mean. - Is there anything else you can tell us? - Yeah, fuck the police! - Oh, you mean like right now? - Nice job, you fucking pervert. - Right now, right now? - Let's go, Herd! - Hmmm. Rare. Very rare. - It's solid gold, I know they were worth something. - Whoa, most definitely worth something, my friend. I understand you have some diamonds too? - That I do. - Let me take a look. How many of these did you say you have? - 20 of them. - Mazeltov, my friend? - How'd it go? - It went real well. - I knew it, daddy. I knew it. - Hey, hold on to this till we make the exchange. It'll make you feel better in the mean time. (upbeat music) - So ladies, Benny met with the jeweler, about the coins and the diamonds, and he's willing to pay 700,000 for them. - Damn, you for real? - For real, for real, big facts. - Damn, that's what I'm talking about. - So with the 300,000 in cash, and the 700,000 in gold and diamonds, we hit for a milli in Detroit. - Hell, yeah. But you know what, Benny still has to get his 20%. So that leaves us with the $800,000 breakdown. - Yeah, but them clowns we hit in Atlanta, we got them for like 800,000, that's all ours. We don't give Benny shit. - So that's 400,000 a piece y'all on one trip. - [All] Damn. - So when we getting the money for the diamonds? - Slow down. Next week, Benny gotta set up with a meeting, Downtown for the exchange. - Cool, they got a restaurant run down there that I like.

Life long gang banger, until you graduated into the narcotics game where you've sold, damn marijuana, heroin and everything in between. You just got convicted of a double homicide. - Look, lady, I know who I am, and you know who I am. You could save this Wikipedia shit. Now, what I don't know is who you are, and why you here? - Well, Mr. Jones, I'm Detective Lewis, Miami Police Homicide Precinct 12. - Detective Lewis. Call me Rocko. You didn't work on my case, so why are you here? - Ricardo, in your statement, you said, "Three females dressed in all black, wearing diamond masks were the shooters of you, your two slain associates, and the other murdered victim at the scene of the crime." But are you sure it was three and not four? - I said, "Call me Rocko," and I can count. I did graduate the eighth grade, lady. So like I said, in my statement, the three bursts through the back door of where me and my associates were having Bible study at. - Yeah right, man, come on. - Right hand to God. - This should be a start of a good relationship. - As long as this work is right, it's gonna be a beautiful relationship. - Rocko, as you say, the work speaks for itself. - We were just in the middle of discussing Luke verse 12, man. The lights clicked off, they burst in, and all I saw was bullets flying all around me. (gun fires) Whoa, this a set up? - Look, calm the fuck down! - Its a set up up? - Look, this ain't no nothing. - What the fuck Rocko? - This ain't no mess, calm the fuck down! - Okay, and? - Well, that's where I got on my knees, and I started praying to Jesus, and that's when I got shot. I fell back, and I couldn't feel my legs. (guns firing) When the lights clicked back on, all I saw was the asses of three women running out the back door. - Don't touch my fucking money. - I got the money. - What the fuck do you have to do with that? - Then I am taking this bag along. - Fuck it, grab it, let's go. - And the money and the work was gone. - Cash and work as you call it at a Bible study class? Come on, man. (Rocko laughs) - No, no, I mean, it was tithes and Bibles. - Right. - Look, bottom line is the pig stuck me with the murders. And all I was doing was trying to defend myself, that ain't that some shit. - That is some shit. Look, do you happen to know who those three girls are? (Rocko laughs) - So the pigs want me to do their job for them now, huh? Okay, you know, I didn't know who they were back then, but I know exactly who they are now. Word on the street is the bag girls. - The bad girls. - Not the bad girls, the bag girls. - The bag girls? Yo, where can I find them. - No, now, that's gonna cost you. - Okay. Look, I can talk to your judge. You know, tell them you're a cooperating witness on a case that I'm working on. Get a few years shaved off your sentence, and until then, I can fill your cell with plenty of commissary. (Rocko laughing) - Yo, guard, you hear this this shit, commissary? You think I give a fuck about a few years shaved off my sentence? I'm doing 25 to life, that ain't nothing. Oh, you really thought you was gonna swam you with some ramen noodles or some chips? Hell, no. - So what would you like, Rocko? - Now, you're talking. So look, I'ma be in this hell whole for the rest of my life, paralyzed from the waist down. You know, I can barely jack my time away, but my mind still works and my memory is real good. So what I would like as a lifetime memory of your titties. - Excuse me! - You heard me.

She kept talking, so I punched on her. - Hell, yeah. (Daisy laughs) - Yeah, the bitch hit me back though, but that shit ain't hurt. I was about to jump on her again, and she pulled a pistol out on me. - Damn, cuz, you good. - Oh, you know I'm good. - But what else she say? - She say she gonna try to find out more information, but she don't know if it's three or four of us. - Damn. - She popped up on me and Nola the other day at the nail salon. Man, that mean, she's most definitely watching us. - And dropping hints about Vinny's ass too. - Okay, wait, see, this is too much. We're gonna have to lay low for awhile. - Girls, the heat is definitely on us. After we get the money for these diamonds, we need to retire these masks. - Yeah, 'cause I'm about to get married. I can't be somebody's wife and a whole stick-up artist at the same time. - Well, I got work in the streets, and I'm about to have more, so, I'm good. - I have Italee to think about. - Look y'all, we had a good ride, but man, I'm done. - And if you done, I'm done. - My mask is in the house, I'm about to go get it. - Damn, that's how we going out?

You just got to let me solve all your problems, or I can get you through them. Tell me what's really bothering you. - I just feel like I'm under a lot of pressure. I feel like I got the world on my back. - [Kenny] Okay. - And I feel like, maybe, I need to escape for a minute, maybe relocate. - Relocate. - [Dee] Yeah, permanently. - And leave Miami, the 305? It's one of the most beautiful cities in America. - Well, maybe, it's time to leave America. (knocking on door) - Where is Italee? Nana is here to watch you again. - She's upstairs asleep, but I wanted to talk to you about something first. - Okay, baby. Everything all right?

So, from the writing on the wall upstairs, I take it you're my fourth bag girl. - I don't know what you talking about. - How many more people have to die before y'all stop doing what you're doing? - Doing what? This was a home invasion going bad. We don't know what you're talking about. - Yall just don't get it. You don't get it. Even when the writing's on the wall, and in your case in blood. - Bitch, I'll slap the fuck out of you. That's my home girl grandma you talking about. - Try me if you want to! - Stop!
