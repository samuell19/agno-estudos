(upbeat party music) (voices overlapping) - I've known this guy since we're like six years old. And when he was in high school, he dropped out. Everyone told him, awe you're crazy. You're gonna be broke. And you'll be working at McDonald's. Three years later, he's got this house in the Hills. And he just keeps making money. He can't help himself. - More shots? - Yes. - Shots, shots, shots, more shots. (upbeat party music) - I been out here for a couple of years. Where are you all from? - [Girl] I'm from Mississippi. - Mississippi? - Yeah. - Well, what brought you out here? - [Girl] Modeling. - (voices overlapping) - (upbeat party music) - Have you ever thought about acting. - [Girl] I've thought about it, yeah. - I can get you in a movie. (girls laughing) (upbeat party music) - To Leo. (upbeat party music) You know, you should have had your friend stick around. We all could have had some fun, and you know talk some business in the hot tub together. - I think she had to leave early. She had to work or something tomorrow. - Well, speaking of hot tubs, I'm gonna go get in, and pop some champagne. Why don't you just keep cleaning up a little bit, take out the trash for me, put on that bathing suit I like, and meet me out there. - Sure. - Oh, thanks babe.

Yeah, well tell it to the girl that just got robbed. - What, bitch? Somebody just tried to rob you? - No not me, some girl on the train. Happened right in front of me. And you know what? All these jackasses were just standing around doing nothing with their phones. Isn't that fucked up? - World star. - If he wouldn't have ran straight into traffic, I would've caught his ass. - Asshole. I mean, bitch you crazy.

You gonna get yourself killed. - I should probably shower first. - You know where the towels are. (cell phone buzzing) - Hey Maurice, I just saw your message. - And? - [Kassi] I'll promise I'll have the money for you next week. - You're not listening to me. Get your shit out of my apartment. That works better for me at this time. - No, but I-- - Kassi, Kassi. Your problem and your situation doesn't concern me anymore. - No, I promise- - You're not listening, I'm evicting you, unless you got my money by the end of this weekend. This is the deal, Sweetheart. Don't call me back unless you got my money. Goodbye. - Fuck. - Yeah. I'm not too thrilled about it either. - Well, I could just drive me and my homegirl up there myself. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. No. Sasha doesn't want more than one car driving up there. - All right, then. It is what it is. - We don't have time for this shit. Bus leaves in 10 minutes, kiddos. Then I'm out. - She's nice. - No, I'm a bitch. And you're more than welcome, not to come. 10 minutes. - What's up her ass? - Girl. I don't know, and I don't care. Well, honestly. I made her think that I fucked her man. (laughing) - Well, that's gonna be a fun ride. Enjoy. - Girl, we're gonna have so much fun. - We? - Yes girl. You said you needed a job, right? - Yeah, but I- - Well, your bestie looked out. And I got you one with a bonus, a free trip to No Cal, so. Get your little bag, let's go. - I don't know. I can't just get up and go. I might get an audition or a- - Kas, Kas, you're not gonna let me ride along with that bitch by myself. - Doesn't seem like she wants me there. - That's what my bestie's coming with me.

Okay? - What is that smell? - These are the killing fields. It's super up fucked up what they do to them, too. They have them all huddled together, trapped until they murder them. - They milk them here too, you know. - So sad. - If you can't handle that, city girl, how are you supposed to make it on the farm? - I can't kill animals, no matter how much they- - Girl, you're not about to be killing no animals. She's just being a bitch. - Takes one to know one. - Anyways, why are we going up to this farm? And what do they farm there? - You really didn't tell her anything, did you? This is California. What do you think we'll be farming? - Pot. I don't know the first thing about that stuff. I barely smoke it. - It doesn't matter if you even smoke it. It's just basic watering, and taking off dead leaves. Bullshit like that. The grower does the rest - The grower? - Yes, girl. Sasha. - He's my boyfriend. - Girl, he's cool as fuck. He's smart. - Fuck! - Sophisticated. And so much fun to be around. (slaps landing) We've only kicked it a few times. But like I said girl, he's cool as fuck. - Okay. That's far enough. You think he likes you? He just uses you for an extra hand. Keep playing. Let's see where that gets ya. (calm music) (cell phone ringing) - [Dima] Sasha, Sasha, Sasha. - Hello? - What were the terms of deal we discuss? - Terms? - Yes, Sasha. The terms. I finance your little operation, and you provide me with the amount of product that you promised to me. Those were the terms, Sasha. Tell me. Have you been trying to avoid me, Sasha? You haven't answered. - How about this? I got some beautiful girls coming up here. I can give them to you, just like the last ones for your business. - [Dima] No. - These girls are really gorgeous. You didn't make good on your end of deal. So now I make good on my promise to you. Goodbye, Sasha. - Dima. (dramatic music) - You want us to take care of him? - No. Send that two face boy. He owe us favor. - I'll let him know. - Thank you, Yury. Yury? You tell him they have girls. He brings back to me alive, okay? - Understood. (dramatic music) - Since I know this priss won't do it, you're pumping, free ride. - Hey, I need to call my mom while there's service, tell her I'll be gone a few days. - Go ahead, girl. I'll pump. It would really rile that bitch up to be wrong. (cell phone ringing) - Hello? - [Kassi] Hi. - Kassi? - How are you? - I don't know how I manage, but I do. Hey, have you talked to your manager? - No, I haven't talked to my manager yet. - I have no faith in him. I think we should leave him, and talk about you moving back home. - No, I'm staying. - Kas, sometimes you have to give up, and say enough's enough. - No, I can do this. - [Mother] Kas, you aren't getting any younger. - Please, don't be like- - I just, I want to do what's best for my daughter. And I feel I should tell her- - I'm headed up North for a few days. - For what? To run off and screw around? - No, I'm not off screwing around. I'm going to make some money. - Who am I to tell you not to? I'm only your mother. The lady who gave you life and shelter, and- - I promise I'll call you when I get service. - When you get service? This makes me very uncomfortable, Kassi. You don't want me going crazy. - Okay. - [Mother] Call me in a few hours. - Bye. - Bye. (calm music) - Ever since reading that book I took from that crazy lady, Velma, it seems that the evil on this mountain, and the disappearances, date back to the 1800s. A lady named Eve was sent here by the Catholic church to investigate the disappearances, because of course they knew. Men, both young and old, suddenly began disappearing. - I don't know, Eve. I don't know if I'll ever find my Paul and William. - You mustn't be afraid of that, Mary. We have to be strong. We have to stop this. Are you ready to serve with us, Mary? - And she tracked her. And she found them. - So, can you show me around these hills? I do know all these parts. - All the parts? - I don't think we should go any further. People have been disappearing. - If you want me, we need to go to a place where we can be completely alone. (suspenseful music) - Evil takes forms you would never expect, Mary. (door slams) - Eve, I saw the one you spoke about She's leading Thomas into the forest. What do we do? - We must go now, girls. We are protected by the power of God. And we will strike this evil with his mighty sword. We're going to need it. (ritualistic singing) (dramatic music) - (grunting) - (Mary squeals) Quiet, Mary. We mustn't let anything stop us. This is God's work we're doing now. - (dramatic music) - (ritualistic singing) (grunting) Quickly, Mary. The knife. - (dramatic music) - (ritualistic singing) - (grunting) - (ritualistic singing) (dramatic music) - Lady Eve's failed attempt is the only known effort to find and annihilate the evil that is known to wander these woods. It's said that no mortal man, with arms, can destroy it. But a knife blessed with the blood of a virgin woman has the power to save a man's soul, or destroy the evil altogether. Ladies. Ladies, ladies. Welcome to Chateau Sasha. Chris, you didn't introduce me to your friend, spunky girl. - Oh yeah. Sash, this is Kas. - Pleasure. Let me show you to your rooms. Marissa. You'll be in here, my love. Well, she's pleasant. All right, ladies, down here. Kassi, you're gonna be right here, darling. And Christiana, I'm gonna have you right in here. - No, girl. He got his own. (door squeaks then slams shut) (suspenseful music) - Be downstairs in five minutes, ready to go to the green house. (dogs howling and whining) - Great. - Watch your step when you're walking through here. There's holes, and glass, and snakes, and other things not too good for your health. - Of course, there's no phone service. Anything else we need to know about? - Just werewolves and aliens. Your job is so easy, monkeys can do it. I mix the nutrients, and you water each plant. If you mess up, or one of the plants die, I will bury you on the property, never to be heard from again. Are we understood? All right, then. - Girl, he's just playing. - What the fuck is going on? What'd you get me into? - Sucks. There's no services in here. And Sasha gets all conspiracy when it comes to wifi. - Hello? I'm freaking out. This weirdo want-to-be pimp, and his crazy ho. Plus we're stuck in the middle of nowhere with them. - Look, girl. They're just different. But they're cool. I don't like everyone I work with, but it's a job. Plus, this job pays 500 a day, more than enough to pay your water bill, and to get those head shots you wanted. So can you get it together? It's time for dinner. (gypsy music) - Well, someone's got a bit of an attitude. - Would help if the bitch wasn't sitting across from me. - I will not tolerate that kind of language at my table. - So now I'm the bitch. Fuck it, you can have him. - Well, at least if we fuck, her attitude might be worth it. - That's it. - None of this! Out of my face with this. - Honestly, I- - Stop it! Now I made an amazing meal. And all you girls can do is poop on my appetite. It's like, everybody is out to fuck Sasha. (gypsy music) - She should have called. I told her to call. - She's gonna call. She always calls. - Do you think I'm overreacting? - A little bit. - Okay. Fine. (chattering from television) What are you watching? - Some murder mountain shit about Humboldt County. - Kas? Where are you gonna go? It's not like there's Uber out here. - I thought I had problems. I'd rather be sitting in my crappy apartment, with no water and in the dark, then be caught up in this shit. - Calm down. Put your bag down. Kas. (suspenseful music) (sobbing) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - You sure this is the spot, man? - Yeah, this is the place. Okay, let's do like we planned. - Everything's gonna be okay. Okay? (suspenseful music) - Okay. I'll stay. - Like you had a choice. Friends for life. (suspenseful music) (distant rattling) - (gagging) - (monster roaring) - What the hell was that? - I think it came from downstairs. (suspenseful music) (sobbing) What the fuck did you do? - I didn't do it. I found him like this. - I told you that we slept together, but I didn't know you was gonna kill. This is too much. - I didn't do it. I didn't. (rattling across the ceiling) It's probably what's making all that noise upstairs. - There's not time for this. There's somebody in the house. - She's right. We're spending too much time with this. We should be figuring a way out of here. - Let's get the fuck out of here. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) Open the door! Open the door. - I forgot the fucking keys. - We have to run. (suspenseful music) Go. I've got a cramp. Go on. Why are you still here? You killed Sasha. - I did not kill Sasha. I loved him. How do I know you didn't do it? - What? - No, no, no. She was with me. - I was with Kassi. - Well, it wasn't me. It had to be someone else. - Look, we can't just stand here. - I don't know what to tell you, but I'm not running around in the dark with this bitch, so. - [Kassi] Chris, come on. Let's go. - Come on. - Let's go. - [Mother] None of my calls or messages are going through. She's gotta be up there. - Would you take it down a notch? - Up there could be anywhere. Shit, there's places in LA I don't even get service. - She said she's going up North to make some money. It's pretty obvious where she went. - Yeah well, there's a lot of places up North. San Francisco's up North, Sacramento. I even heard Sonoma's a beautiful place this time of year. - She's there. - Sonoma? - Humboldt County. - How can you tell? - I've got location tracking enabled on all the family plan phones. - Babe, I'm on the family plan. (phone ringing) - Sheriff Owen. - You've got to find my daughter! (upbeat show music) - Becca? You see my good knife around? (upbeat show music) Rebecca Jacobs? How about you give her old man a little hand here? (upbeat show music) - You know, it's probably in the fucking kitchen, where you always put it. (upbeat show music) It's right fucking here. (upbeat show music) - [Tim] Ah, there's my Baby. - [Becca] Here. - Yeah, that's the one now. Well thank you, dear. (upbeat show music) - Hold on. This like the "Texas Chain Saw Massacre". (shushing) They ain't 'bout to be cutting off our face, running around in these woods. - This isn't a fucking movie. Shut up. Excuse me? - Oh, ladies. Can I help you? We just need to use your phone. Well. Come on in. It's nice and safe and warm inside. Oh this? Don't pay no mind. I was just whittling. Here, here, here. Why don't you just take it, and you feel safer with, huh? - I'm sorry, we just. We just want to use your phone. - Well sure. Come on in. Oh, here's my daughter. How about some nice warm tea for these young ladies? - Sure thing. - [Kassi] Okay. Thank you. - That bitch looks fucking crazy. - Shut up. Shut the fuck up. - She killed him. - [Becca] You ladies do come in. - Look, I've told you 100 times. I can't help you if you don't calm down. - I am calm. I'm doing your goddamn job for you, aren't I? - Well look, I have to admit, the coordinates and maps you sent, that was, that was some impressive work. - Well, thank you. It's mostly through Google Maps, and Street View that I found them. - Yes you did. - Well, you know, I know most of these people out there. Most of those people and just good Christian folks. This one down at the bottom though. Yeah, I don't know, I guess it's worth sending somebody out to check it out for you. - Well, what are you waiting for? Call them now, you idiot. - So you're saying that you like it when she licks you there? - Yeah, man. It just means she really loves me, you know? At least that's how I see it. - A man's got to have some boundaries. - Boundaries? Come on, man. You want me to stop her, and get her all upset? - I mean, yeah man. Look look, that's all you, you know. I just can't have a dog tongue all in my ear, you know? Is this unhygienic. - [Sheriff] Marlack, you got a copy? - Unhygienic? Un-hygienic. - Marlack here. Could you repeat that? Over. - Yeah, you guys buy that old Crosspoint property up on the North Ridge? - Yeah. We're about a mile away from that place. - Look, I got out some hysterical mom, thinks her daughter's lost out there. Phone GPS puts her in that area. Can you guys try to find this girl, and help get this crazy-ass woman off my back? - [Marlack] I'll head over there and check it out. - Good deal. Keep me posted. Over. - We got a call. - Is it some bullshit? - Yeah, but we're close. Come on. - All right. Let's go. (calm music) - [Becca] Here ladies. (tray slams down) Drink up. - Becca. Oh, and I bet you that tastes good, don't it? Please go right ahead. It'll be good for you. - My head feels like it's literally swelling. - Me too. - [Kassi] Are you okay? - [Chris] Oh my God. - Chris, are you okay? Chris? What did you do? (loud thumping) (calm music) - Then she took Jonathon from me. I knew. I knew she was terrible from the way she looked at him. - Did the girl you speak of happen to look like this? (gasping) - That's her. That's that terrible girl. She took him. She took him from me. - I will avenge him for you. Can you please show me the direction in which she came? - She came from that way. - What the hell is wrong with you? - (belt hitting) - (girl groaning) (dramatic music) (people whistling) (suspenseful music) - Get the girl. - (coughing) - Marlack here. We got multiple bodies at this house you just sent us to. And the girl is nowhere to be found. - [Sheriff] Can you guys try to find this girl, and help this crazy-ass woman- - We're gonna head down the mountain and canvas the area. Maybe she'll turn up down the road, or at the neighbor's house. - [Sheriff] Phone GPS puts her in that area. - Yeah, I get that her phone's GPS says that she's here. But trust me, she's not. Call the local police, and let them know what we found. And let us do our job. - I don't know what the happened in there. But whatever it is, that girl had something to do with it. Why else would her phone be inside? - Her mom called the station, trying to find her. This is where her phone GPS said she was. Maybe she got kidnapped or- - All right look. Let's just head down the mountain, and see if she turns up. And we better be ready for battle if we run into whoever the fuck did that shit in there. (suspenseful music) (breathing heavily) - (voices overlapping) - (all crying) - [Becca] So you're awake? (girls crying) - Oh, now don't you worry your little heads. We'll all be done real soon now. (girls crying) - All right, so the closest property is about two miles this way. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, man. You can't do that up in here. You know you can get suspended for that, right? Or worse, if you gotta use that gun tonight. Fuck our luck, man. I think this is it right here. All right, let's go check this out. - [Tim] Ah, and look at you. - Let us out of here! - I'm afraid I can't do that darling. (laughing) Oh yeah, and look at you. How are you doing there, girl? (knocking on door) (girls screaming) (punch lands) Not a sound. (suspenseful music) What the hell's going on out there? - It's the fucking cops. - Well, then just go out there and flash your tits or something. - I'm not gonna show my fucking tits. Go fucking deal with the cops. I'll deal with the fucking girls. - Okay, just for once in your life, can you just do something right? Now just take care of them, please? - So, I'm supposed to take care of them. (suspenseful music) - Officers. What can I do for you tonight? - Good evening, Sir. Sorry to bother you. We received a call from concerned mother. Seems her daughter never rang last night, and the GPS from he phone records place her in these parts. We were just wondering if you've seen or heard anything. - No. No, I haven't seen no girls around here tonight. - Please help us. Please help us. (voices overlapping) - I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you. You think I want to be out here? I'm stuck. - But you have a gun. - Shoot that mother fucker! Go shoot his ass! Please? - You alone tonight, sir? - Oh yeah, all alone. Well, except for my daughter. You know, but I don't even consider her a person anymore if you know what I mean. - Well, would you mind if we asked her if she's seen anything? - Well, she's in her robe and curlers right now. And believe me you don't want to be seeing that. But just hold on a second. I'll go ask her, okay? - Thank you, sir. (suspenseful music) - It is the damn police. - Thank God. - Shut the fuck up. Do you understand? Stay quiet, or you're gonna get a bullet in the head. - I'm gonna take a look around. - All right. (knocking on door) - Take this, and keep them fucking quiet. I'm coming, officer. I'll be right there. - (knocking on door) - Hello? - (soft chittering) - (suspenseful music) What is that? (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (girls crying) - You don't have to be a victim too. Just come with us. We can get out of here, if you just come with us. - Do I look like a victim to you, bitch? (dramatic music) - Holy shit, there's a dead policeman out on my porch. - [Marlack] This is Deputy Marlack. I'm coming in. - [Tim] What do we do now? - [Marlack] If you got any weapons, place them on the ground now. (dramatic music) Put the gun down. - I had no choice. - Put the gun down, ma'am. We can just talk about this. - He made me do it. - Do what? - He hit me so much. - Oh shut your hole, you cock scab. - Ma'am, I need you to put the gun down right now. Ma'am, drop the gun now. - No. No. - Don't point your gun. Right now. - Damn you, cunt. God damned. (guns firing) (suspenseful music) (growling) - (dramatic music) - (grunting) - Don't leave me, guys. (suspenseful music) - Wait wait, wait wait wait. What about Marissa? - You can't be serious. You really want to die for that bitch? Let's go, girl. - We can't just leave her there. That's fucked up. (gun fires) - Yo, bitch. That sounds like death to me girl. Let's go. - No, I can't. I can't. I'm going in alone. I'll catch up. (suspenseful music) - Kassi, Christiana. Oh, thank God. (girls crying) (suspenseful music) - [Kassi] He's coming. He's coming. (suspenseful music) (coughing) (chittering) (girls screaming) (whistling) - (chittering) - (dramatic music) (whistling continues) - (chittering) - (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) - What the fuck? What the fuck is going on? We're on this mountain with a fucking deranged killer. And there's something else down there, something out of this world. - Kassi's not lying. We were in the fucking weirdo's kitchen. This girl looking figure killed the old man. - What? - If it had seen us, we would have been next. Yo, all I know is we need to get to the bottom of this mountain. And when we do, we're going straight to the cops, okay? No, we need to go right now. (dramatic music) (dogs howling) - Yo, yo, yo. - There's nothing there. Keep your voice down. You're gonna get us all killed. - (twig snaps) - I heard it too! (suspenseful music) - Let's keep on pushing. (all screaming) - Why are you girls on my property? You're trespassing. Come with me. It isn't safe for you here. (dramatic music) - Girls, let's go. - Who the fuck is she? - I don't know. - Come on. What choice do we have? - (dogs howling) - Fuck! - I don't own a phone, if that's what you're waiting to ask me. Girls, you sure look cold. Can I get you some tea? - No. We've had enough tea for lifetime today. Thank you. - Yeah, if you could just point us the direction of town or a road to how to get out of here. - Well, town is 20 or so miles away. And at this time of night, you never know who you'll meet on the road. Might be worse than the trouble you're already in. - How do you know we've been in trouble? - I've been watching you. - What do you mean, you've been watching us? - Ladies, I think we should just go because- - Oh, relax. I'm not interested in you. I was watching the boy. - Who, Sasha? - What about Sasha? - He stole something from me. - [Kassi] What? - A book, a very old book that was given to me by my mother, which was given to her by her mother, and her mother, and her mother, and her mother and her mother, and her mother, and her mother, and her mother, which was given to her and the Devil himself. - Yo, why does everything have to be so demonic? - Wait. So what would Sasha want with this book? - I think he thought it would protect him from the angry spirit in the woods. - What kind of spirit? - Many many years ago, there was a convent in these mountains. And there was a girl there, who was not much older than the three of you. (suspenseful music) (Nun crying) (grunting) (suspenseful music) - No! Do you wish to end up inside of the pot, tonight? What you will find inside is my last uninvited guest. (laughing) - I know who you are. They told me that you lived out here. They told me you were evil, and you knew spell. (laughing maniacally) - And you decided to come here anyway. (laughing) You're a Nun. (laughing) - I came to make an offer, to your savior. - You? The servant of the cloth? - Every night I'm laid down, and my virtue's brutally taken from me. I no longer choose to serve a false God that's never answered one of my prayers. (owl hooting) (suspenseful music) - When calling upon a wicked spirit, we must make him aware of the trade that we want to happen. In your case, there is a specific entity who seeks vengeance for the abused soul, such as yours. Now, you must shed the clothes that you are wearing, and throw it into the fire. (suspenseful music) My dear father from down below, we ask for your permission to call upon one of your children that you gracefully created. Lillith, she's gonna leave her foolish convent, and join you in order to do your bidding up here on Earth. She's gone to leave her faith behind, and sign her soul to you. (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) - The Devil doesn't give gifts, without taking something in return. So now her spirit is trapped in this plane, and she'll roam the woods for all of eternity, seeking vengeance for the past whenever she can find it. - Why do these people have to be so fucking crazy? - Crazy? Who are you calling crazy, huh? - I mean like, if the shoe fits. - Get out. - Not but we- - Get out! Get out! Get out! - (dramatic music) - (girls crying) (crow cawing) - We have to keep going. If we don't, who knows what sort of crazy we'll run into next? - I just need a second. I just, I just want to rest my eyes. - I want to keep going. I know we need to, but she's right. We should rest. We'll be safer in daylight anyway. - I don't think we're safe as long as we're up here. You rest. I'll keep lookout. (dramatic music) (birds singing) (dog barking) (suspenseful music) Wake up, wake up. Wake the fuck up. (suspenseful music) We gotta leave now. Wake up. - Where do we go? Which way do we go? - (suspenseful music) - (dog barking) - Yeah, you smell it. Which way did they go? Run, rabbit. Yeah we're onto you now, bitches. - (dramatic music) - (dog barking) (dog barking) Run! - (dramatic music) - (dog barking) (gun fires) - Don't y'all take another step now. - What are we doing? - Go on, get. (grunting) - I'd hate to put another hole through you, honey. You too, fuck tits. (laughing) (dog barking) - Looks we come across a couple of T makers come this far. You're fucked, bitches. (dog growling) - What do you think we should do with these pretty little things? - I got a few ideas for you ladies. - I say we hog tie them to the shed, have ourselves a Mexican fiesta. I can't wait to bust that pinata open. (dog barking) What are you gonna do, Frank. - I like that idea. - Oh my God. (dramatic music) (dog barking) (Marissa crying) - What the fuck, Heather? - Baby. - Relax, man. - Relax? No, you fucking relax, man. - Baby, you know I love you. - You know what? Fuck this guy. And you can't take your fucking eyes off these. Don't you fucking touch me. Don't fucking touch me. Don't touch me. Man get the off me, man. What the fuck you? Come on, man. (dramatic music) - [Heather] Why you gotta be so hard on him? - [Frank] He'll be all right. (girls scream) Just gotta ween him off that tit, that's all. - [Heather] Yeah? You first. (suspenseful music) - Oh yeah. Oh you're a dirty bitch, huh? - What the fuck are you looking at, huh? You got a little something on her face. (girls crying) You got a fucking problem? I don't like you. Come here. - (dog barking) - (Marissa screaming) - (dog barking) - (James mimics dog barking) Yeah, fuck you! Yeah, you think I'm a joke? - I apologize about my friend. He's a real asshole. - Oh fuck, fuck. - (dog barking) - Let me help you out a little. - No! Fuck no! Please stop. - That's interesting. - You fucking asshole. - Ooh, you're a little feisty? How about you, Mexicana? You want to suck my dick? You like to dance a little bit? Maybe a little of that? - (slap lands) - (Chris crying) - [Heather] How about this? - [James] And get the fuck out the way. I can't see. - [Heather] What? Boys, this one thing she's tough. - [Frank] We gonna have to tame her, baby. - (slap lands) - (girls crying) - Oh my God. - [Heather] You got something to say to me? - Fucking bitch. - What'd you say? - I said fucking bitch. - I got an idea. (girls crying) We're gonna play a game. (girls crying) You ladies like games? I got a nice riddle for you ladies. How did it go? Eenie, meenie, minie, mo, catch a nigger by her toe. If she hollers let her go. Eenie, meenie, minie, mo. And you are it. - (gun fires) (girls crying and screaming) Clean up your mess. (girls crying) - Baby, if all we're gonna do is kill them, why don't we get a little creative? - [Heather] You want to have some fun? - You know I want to have some fun. - How you doing? Good boy. Hey there, Big Red. A little storm, we've been through them before. Okay, buddy. (suspenseful music) Sara? Is that you? (calm music) (gasps) - I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. - Are you lost? - I'm not lost. I'm quite the opposite, actually. (suspenseful music) I must apologize for just showing up at your house out of nowhere. I don't want to take up too much of your time, but do you have kin that have gone missing? Have you no men in your home? - Just my husband. He's at the stables right now, checking on his horse. (suspenseful music) Why do you ask? (gun fires) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (dramatic music) - [Heather] Get! Get out there. Get, nigger. Get. I said get. Get up. Get. - (dog barking) Don't look at me. Get up and move. Keep moving, go. Get. See that log? Go. (dog barking) - Let go of her. Get off of her. (sniffing deeply) - [Chris] Oh my God, eww. What the fuck? (dramatic music) - You're a real Picassee. - It's pronounced Picasso. - You're right. - [Mark] What we gonna do with them? - Let's fuck 'em. They're right here, let's. - [Chris] No. - You'd like that, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you? - Oh fuck. Fuck. (suspenseful music) - You know what, boys? This isn't fair. I'm gonna give you a chance. I'm gonna give them a choice. You can get raped or run. (Chris crying) Either way, you're fucked. Now get up. I said move. Get. Get. (gun fires) Get. You got 57 seconds till I release my hound. (dramatic music) (groaning in pain) - You fucking ass hat. - Will you two stop chasing each other's dicks, and get these girls before this whole thing turns into a real fuck up? Get! - (dog barking) - (dramatic music) - Yeah, we smell you bitches. Oh, that pussy smells real nice. - Bet you a blow job I can nab them first. (dramatic music) - I'll take that bet. (dramatic music) - Yeah, we smell that pussy. (dramatic music) Run, rabbit. (dramatic music) I can smell it. Come on, boy. Oh yeah.

(dramatic music) - Frank? James? (dramatic music) - Kas, help me. Let's hide. They're gonna get us. Just hide. - What do you mean hide? Let's keep going. - I'm not running no more. Look, let's hide please. Let's hide. Where are we gonna go? - Let's go, we have to run! (laughing) - Darling, you gotta excuse my friends. They can be a little inappropriate Me, I believe in the golden rule. You got to treat others like. Well, you know the rest. These are my woods. You want to play with me? (twig snaps) Ooh. Are we gonna have some fun with you? Yeah. We gonna skin us a little piggy today. You want to play with me? I like games. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - (squishing) - (dramatic music) - We should go over there. There's a house or something. I don't know. I see a house. - Kassi. It's just more, some more fucking inbred hicks out here. - Who you calling a crazy hick, nigger? - You, you fucking retarded ass bitch. You got us fucked up. - (gun fires) - (Kassi screams) (Kassi gasping) - She always run her mouth like that? How long you known her, and never done that? (dramatic music) I told you, you was gonna lose. Move. Go! Get moving, bitch. Get down in the mud. You are mud. Get down, nigger lover. Get. I said you'd be fucked either way. Get. Get. I said get. Get in the mud. Get down. Get. Get. (grunting) - (punches landing) - (dramatic music) (screaming) - I was once like you. I used to wear the habit, then they stole my dignity. - Do you think this will save you from being cast back to the pits of Hell, from which you came? Speak now, demon. (Heather grunting) - Isn't that what they did to you? Those people? The way you're taught to fear everything? (Heather grunting) Let me help you. Don't you want to avenge them? They will just be more. (somber music) - Go. (somber music) (Eve crying) (dramatic music) - [Woman] Isn't it just so peaceful? - [Man] It really is, it really is. - It's so peaceful, you know. - Thank you for bringing me. - You gotta love the green. - Gotta love the green, yeah. Gotta love it. - Are you fucking serious, right now? - What? What's wrong? - You're gonna fucking smoke that right now? - Name a better time to get high then now. - What more could you need to be relaxed? - You do your yoga, your breathing exercises to relax. This is my breathing exercise. - It's not the same. Nice try, but not. - Inhale, exhale. - And what about the cops? - I don't give a fuck about the police. You know where I'm from? Niggers die every day. I don't give a fuck about the police. - What the fuck does that even mean? What the fuck does that even mean? - You ain't never gonna understand what it means. - Yeah, just like you're never gonna fucking listen to me. (dramatic music) - What the fuck? Yo, call the cops. Call the cops. Hold on. Yo, what the fuck. What's the number to 911? - Why are you a dumb ass? - Look, who the fuck is this bitch? This is why I smoke weed, and I don't fucking hike. (sirens blaring) - There go you're fucking cops, tough guy. - Fuck you. You would have called the cops too. - Yeah, I would have. I'm white. (sirens blaring) - So before we get to how my two deputies ended up dead at old man Jacob's place, why don't you tell me how this whole thing got started, again? - I just was trying to make some money to pay my bills. - Yeah, yeah yeah. You and the other thousand idiots that come up through here every year, like it's a fucking gold rush. Okay so, this guy, Sasha. You and your friends decided to murder him and his crew. Or how about this? You guys decided to rob them, and it all went to shit. - I keep trying to tell you. I didn't kill anybody, and you're not listening. - My two deputies and that nice family? Dead. All this murder taking place around you, and you're just an innocent bystander. - There was something, someone in that house. And I think that's what was trying to follow us, or kill us. I don't know. - All right, go on then. Tell me how these other people die. What about the brothers, down at the bottom of the mountain near the meadow? What did you do? What happened to them? Well, first of all those incestuous brothers that fucked their sister, or whatever they were, they held a gun to us and they tied us up. That's when she shot Chris. And I thought she was gonna shoot me next. And I held her under water. And I held her, and I held her until she wasn't breathing anymore. Nobody else came, so I just took off running looking for help, and now I'm here. - Well, Kassi, you may not want to tell me everything that happened today, but do you know what you just did, Sweetheart? - What? - You just confessed to murder? Murder is illegal in this county, on this mountain, and in the good old US of A. And I have you on first degree murder charges. So Sweetheart, you're gonna need to do a little bit of cooperating if you want any kind of- - It was self defense. - Kassi. - That bitch, she killed two of my friends. Everybody was trying to kill me all night. - Tell me who really sent you here. Huh? - I just want to speak to my lawyer. You have everything on tape. I want my phone call. I'm not saying anything else. - On tape? Listen, honey. I told you, you get one chance to cooperate, right? - I am cooperating. - Really? I tell you what. We're gonna work on trying to reduce your sentence here, give you a little bit of leniency. I would take advantage of that opportunity. I'm the last law man around here for 100 miles. You and your friends, you killed my last two deputes. You owe me, girly girl. (suspenseful music) - (chittering) - (Kassi gasps) What? What is this? - (squishing) - (dramatic music) (eerie wind blowing) (cell phone ringing) - What was that? - That's Kassi. She's just checking in. - Everything Okay? - Yeah, everything's okay. - She's always okay. (upbeat party music) - Hey girl. I was hoping you would come. Shit's about to get lit. Did I tell you Mathew was a producer? And we can talk more about getting you that part or something. Or maybe you can hook up with one of his friends. Speaking about friends, who's this? - This is my new roommate, Lilly. She just moved out here. - Well, welcome to Hollywood.
