MAN: Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! [GASPING] [CROWS CAWING] Daddy? Dad! Dad! Adam! Adam! Oh, God! Adam! Oh, God! Adam! Oh, my God. Clint! Over here! I found him! I found him. I found him. [***] * Waking up * I see them clear * Floating down the river * And hanging from a tree * Hide away from All we fear * * Holding her cold hand * No one can understand Except for me * All right, you're good to go. [HORN HONKS] CLINT: Hey, Bill. BILL: I heard from head office. And? BILL: It's not good. I'm sorry, uh, who'd you-- Who did you talk to? BILL: Uh, Janice. [PHONE RINGS] One second. Hello? Oh, hey. No, that-that doesn't matter. 'Cause he doesn't care. Yes, I will remind him. 6:30. No. 'Cause that's just who he is. Okay, I love you, too. Bye. Sorry. Head office wants this done right away. They wanna try and save their third quarter. Clint, they want you to lay these people off by the end of the month. How many by the end of the month? Four. Four, Bill? Jesus Christ, four? We gotta do this. Four people without jobs is better than 50. No, you know what? Call head office one more time. See if there's anything we can do. Please? They're not gonna budge, Clint. Well, then those corporate clowns can come down here and tell them themselves. Tell their families they don't have jobs or money or any-- [KNOCKING] I'm sorry, Bill. That's not you. Okay? I get it. Hey, Gary. What's going on? There's some guy here, says he's your brother. Adam? Yeah. Thanks, Gary. I'll be right out. Hey, Adam. Hey. I didn't expect you to come here, I thought we'd just meet at the house. I thought I'd just come by and, you know, see the place. I hope you didn't wait too long. No, no. They gave me some coffee. You didn't drink it, did you? Heh. No. This thing. It's been there since we were kids. Yeah. So you're doing Dad's old job, huh? Well, sort of, I guess. I'm head of operations. Dad, uh... hated sitting behind a desk, right? Right. I could take you on a tour if you like. Not that much has changed. Sure. All right. But you'll have to wear one of these, bud. You know, on second thought maybe I'll, uh... Maybe I'll just see you at the house. I'm gonna take a drive through town. Yeah, okay. No problem. See you in a bit. Oh, hey. Dinner is at 6:30, all right? 6:30. Got it. Have I met Uncle Adam before? No. No, you haven't, buddy. I'm hungry. I'm hungry, too. [SIGHS] Okay, fine. Let's eat. [DOORBELL RINGS] Is that him? Could be. Stay right there. Hey. You re late. Yeah, sorry. I just... lost track of time. I see. Well, let's go meet the family. Hey, guys. This is your Uncle Adam. Hi. It s good to see you, Adam. You too, Sophie. Come on in. ADAM: Hey, buddy. Hi. How old are you? Six. And she's my little sister, and she's three. Three, huh? Hi. We almost got started without you. Well, thanks for waiting. ADAM: I went for a drive around town today. Just for old time's sake. Oh, yeah? Yeah. It hasn't changed one bit. What did you expect? An urban sprawl of office buildings and coffee shops? A Starbucks maybe? [LAUGHS] It's a simpler life, Adam. Yeah. What? I didn't say anything! I know that look. [LAUGHS] Man, I can t believe Bradley is as big as he is. Yeah. You know he's gonna be seven next summer? Man. Does he like hunting as much as his dad? Of course. Mostly birds though. Like, if he had to shoot a deer he'd probably cry. I think I'd bawl my eyes out if I had to shoot a deer. [LAUGHS] I'm serious. You know, I can finish up here. Really? You are excused. Thank you. I haven't done dishes in about 10 years, so I'm a little out of practice. Adam? He's glad you're here. [***] "Ladies and gentlemen, skinny and stout. "I'll tell you a tale I know nothing about. "Admission is free, so pay at the door. Pull up a chair And sit on the floor." * My heart it near * My love has gone away * Tell me true * My heart is new * My love has gone away Does Uncle Adam want to stay for a while? No, he's only gonna stay for a quick visit. Could I go hunting with you? No, sorry. Not this time, buddy. The deer are way, way up in the mountain, and it's gonna be a tough climb, even for your old man. [***] But I really want to go with you. No, I know you do. And I promise we'll go together as soon as I get back. But this is gonna be a really, really long hike. And hey, you know how you like to play with your little sister sometimes? Nope. Not at all. [LAUGHS] Yeah, you do. Anyway, that's kinda what your uncle and I need. We just need some time to play by ourselves, all right? Hmm. I know. Okay. Bedtime, buddy. * It's okay * I know someday I'm gonna be with you * * It's okay * I know someday I'm gonna be with you * * It's okay * I know someday I'm gonna be with you * [INDISTINCT CHATTERING ON TV] Where are you going? I'm just gonna see some of the guys in town at Lucy's. Oh. Okay. What? Nothing. Will you relax? We're gonna be together for six days. I-I get it. Just remember we gotta get up early tomorrow, all right? I'll be ready. 6:30 a.m. I got it. I know, it's-- You know, it's just-- You can uh-- I can what? Lose track of time. Will you take it easy? It's a camping trip, not a shuttle launch. CLINT: All right. I wouldn't go to Lucy's if I were you. You'll end up getting drunk and marrying one of the local gals. [LAUGHS] I would have to be extremely drunk to end up with one of those town heifers. Are you calling me a heifer? What? No, not you, I mean-- Come on, you know what I mean. You come home drunk, I'm sending the kids into your room at 6:00 a.m. Sure. Hey, you guys should do a little um... redecorating in here. It's been the same since 1986. Start with that couch. I like this couch. Yeah, me too. We should change the wallpaper, though. [DOOR SHUTS] [***] Do you want me to run out to the truck and get you a proper shirt? I mean, what is that, anyway? It's called a t-shirt. It s a new thing. I know him. He invented communism. Yeah, something like that. What are you, some sort of commie now, or what? [LAUGHS] Why are you here? I'm visiting my brother. Actually, I'm going hunting with him if you can believe it. Nobody's got anything bigger than a grouse over the last five years. Your brother'd be off his rocker if he thinks he can bag a deer. Yeah, well, I'm hoping we don't even see one. Didn't you hate hunting? Yeah. Still do. Maybe Clint knows something we don't know. Where ya headed, anyways? All the way up to the plateau. What? You remember Doug Grant? Hardware store? ADAM: No. He went up there 10 years ago. It was 15 years ago and Doug was an actual retard. Shut up. He wasn't a retard. Yes, he was. ADAM: Okay. Regardless, what happened to him? He went up to the plateau... never came back. And that's it? And nobody ever found out what happened to this guy? Don't worry, buddy. We'll come looking for you. [LAUGHS] I'm gonna get a drink. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Did you charge your cell phone? Yeah, the thing is, uh... cell phones don't work about four hours into the hike, so... Ah, how convenient for you. Right? [LAUGHS] No, trust me. I would... I would definitely call you if I could. Six days with just my brother? Pretty sure I'm gonna end up just talking to the trees. Night, hon. Goodnight. Clint? Yeah? Don't shoot your brother. [SIGHS] ADAM: I just-- I don't wanna hear a story that I can't un-hear. You're wrong, man. You do. 'Cause w-- We-- She just-- I don't know, she just like turned over quickly and all of a sudden her tits were flapping up in my face! [ALL LAUGHING] What do you mean, she turned around? How does that happen? It just-- Yeah. [ALL LAUGHING] Boys, it's late. Unh. Yeah. Woah. I think I gotta go home. Hey, cheers. It was good to see you guys. Cheers. Yeah. Yeah, you too, man. Don't wait another 15 years to come back. Yeah, well if I do, I bet you guys will be sittin' right here. I really hope so. [ALL CHUCKLING] All right. Ah. All right. Peace. Ah, shit. Ow. Watch your step. See ya. [LAUGHING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [SHUTTER BANGING] [***] MAN: Adam! Adam! [VOICE WHISPERING] Hey! Oh, my God, Adam! Oh, Adam, what happened to you? Huh? Huh? Clint! Over here! That mattress is terrible. No one's ever complained. You're the first to whine about it. Coffee? Good times with your old friends? [GROANS] I'll see you outside. Wow. What? What do you expect to carry in that backpack? I got some food, I got my sleeping bag. Okay, what kind of sleeping bag? What difference does it make? It's gonna be freezing up there. I don't know what kind of sleeping bag it is. What is this? I packed you a bag. Why? Well, let's just say I had a hunch. Look. Just because you think you know what you're doing does not mean I need you to pack me a bag. Right. Well, then let's take your car. Why do you gotta be such a dick? I see you traded in dad's old truck. Yeah, dad's died a few years back. He left you the house, he left you the truck. What else did he leave you? Guilt? [***] [HONKS HORN] [GROANS] You scared the piss outta me. Will you come on? I wanna get there before dark. That's dad's gun, right? Yep. Can I use yours? No. You can't hit the bright side of a barn with dad's gun. Can I drive? Also no. You ready? No. [***] Man, I love this place. Yeah, it's great. So how far are we going? Well, we re gonna hike around to that point, then we are right on the plateau. Wow. Yeah, I-I still don t understand why we don't just take the quad all the way up there. I mean, it's a machine that's built to do that. Because, precious, we're doing this old school. I want the sound of engines and the smell of gas miles behind. [SCOFFS] Poetic. [SIGHS] So we're gonna hike up to the plateau. Yeah. Why? Uh. Nothin'. Just the, uh, the guys last night, they were sayin'-- Okay, what did your ladies tell you last night? Nothing. They just said nobody goes up there anymore. Let me guess. They told you the story of Doug Grant? Yeah. Doug had no business being up here. The guy was half retarded. You know, in the civilized world we don't use that word anymore. Just so you know. Whatever. People don't come up here 'cause it's a bitch to hike to, not because of some old wives tale. And I bet there are huge deer just begging to be harvested. And this was your idea. Killed. Huh? Huge deer up there just begging to be killed is what you meant. Whatever. I bet even if we miss we could just walk up and... BOTH: Club them with your gun. Yeah, exactly. Hey, screw it, man. Listen, I'm in. Let's go kill some deer in the face. Harvest. Uh, murder. [***] MAN: Okay, Clint, get him on target. Don't bring your head to the scope, but bring the scope to your head. Right. Aim a bit to the right, the wind'll push it a bit. You wanna hit him in the chest. Okay. I got it, Dad. When you're ready. [EXHALES] [GUN FIRES] He's down. Great shot, Son! Now the hard work begins, huh? BOTH: The fun stops when the animal drops. Hey. You always wanna keep the shell from your first kill. Okay, Dad. You know, there's shooting light for about another hour or so. You wanna see what we can see? Uh... Nah. You can, knock yourself out. I think I'm just gonna chill out here for a moment. Oh, yeah. All right. [ECHOING] ADAM: Did you hear that noise? It was hard to miss. Well, have you ever heard anything like that before? CLINT: No, never. The hell was that? CLINT: Relax, child. There's a bunch of mines out here. They're probably fracking. The sound carries out here. You're just used to your city noises, that's all. Yeah, well I've never heard a noise like that, in the city or anywhere. And it wasn't fracking, I'll tell you that much. Really? What? The fire. Oh, come on. We got a whole other day of hiking ahead of us. I'm cold. The smoke will embed in our clothes and-- ADAM [LAUGHS]: The smoke's gonna-- Okay, sure. Oh, 'cause you hunt. Yeah. Well-- Didn't you bring any deer piss? That's what we use to mask our smells, right? Deer piss? Am I right? [LAUGHS] Yes, as a matter of fact I did. Okay, so then what's the problem? Okay. Tonight only. Did you see anything while you were out there? Yeah. A small doe. Really? That's great! Maybe we don't have to go as far to find some deer then. She's probably just lost. The big bucks, they're higher up the mountain this time of year. [SIGHS] Great. Ah. [ANIMAL HOOTING] [SCRAPING AND RUSTLING] What is that? It's nothing. Go back to sleep. I can't go back to sleep. It sounds like it's getting closer. CLINT: It's just your imagination. Everything sounds louder out here. Woah, woah, woah. What was that? Don't-- Don t do that. No, no, no. I'm-- I'm serious. I heard something else. Okay, we're leaving, all right? There's no way I'm going up any further. Shh. [CLINT LAUGHING] I told you, everything sounds louder out here. [LAUGHING] CLINT: Wake up, bro. We walk from here. Let's get going. Can't we just keep taking the quad? CLINT: Nope. [GROANING] Mom, Mom, Mom, I got one! I finally got one. Where's Adam? He's upstairs. Okay. Hi. Oh, hi. You guys are late. Yeah, we had to go up further than last year. How'd it go? Yeah, good. He got his first one. Unh. Did he cry? Of course not. You should have taken Adam. He wouldn't have come anyway. Yeah, but you still should ask. He thinks you favor Clint. He's not like that at all. Clint and I just like the same things. Well, maybe, as the adult in the relationship, you can find something that you and Adam can enjoy together. Hey, hey, hey. Get washed up before you come near me. Ow! Out! CLINT: Hey, Adam. Guess what, dink? Adam, guess what? I shot a deer. Got him right in the chest. Good for you. You killed something. Dad said it was the biggest one he's seen in years. Almost a fourteen pointer! I have no idea what that means. Oh, well, you have to count the times in the rack-- Clint, what I meant to say is, I don't care. Well, maybe you would care if you came with us for once instead of reading some stupid comic book. Walking through the woods looking for something to kill? No, thanks. You're such a little jerk. Whatever. Dick! Bring it! [***] Bit different from your spin and yoga classes, huh? Shut up. So the good news is we only have to get to the top of that. The bad news is we gotta go the long way around. We're going up there? Yeah. Well, why don t we just cut it short and just climb up right here? CLINT: Because it's too steep, we don't have ropes, and you're carrying a 40 pound backpack, that's why. It doesn't look that dangerous to me. Looks can be deceiving. It's smarter to just go around. No, no. Screw the hour and a half hike. I'm going up here. Hey. I'm too old to lug you out on my back. Okay. Don't die. [GASPING] Shit. MAN: ...first and ten. The closing minutes of the fourth quarter. [BANGING] Are you ignoring this? [BANGING] Christ almighty! [MAN CHATTERING ON TV] Oh, boy. [BOYS GRUNTING] All right, boys. All right. Enough. Clint! Let go of your brother! Enough. Hey. Come on. Fine. Adam, go and set the table. Clint, get those stinky, bloody clothes off right now. [GASPS] You know, your uncle and I used to fight like you guys. Was your brother a dickhead, too? He's not a dickhead. You guys are just different. Oh, you think you're the first brother to be annoyed by his younger sibling? I don't know. Why can't he just be normal? I know your brother doesn't like the same things as us. Adam probably thinks it's you that's not normal. I hate him. You know, time changes everything, bud. You're gonna have to suck it up and be the older brother. I'll try. Good. Now go wash up for dinner, huh? You smell like a slaughter house. I love you, Dad. I love you, too, Son. [***] [TWIG SNAPS] Just tell me, Rambo. Go that way 300 yards. 300 yards? That's like three football fields. Yes. And then I want you to push up and go left. Okay, but if I see the deer, why don't I just shoot it? I have a gun. Because your job is to push it up to me. Oh, I see. Because you want first shotsies. Okay, that's cool. I get it. Shotsies? Just go. [***] [GUN FIRES] CLINT: Hey. So? Did you miss? No, I got him for sure. He just didn't drop. I can t believe you took the shot. Me either. So where'd you hit him? In the chest, I think, but he moved a little bit when I shot. What'd he look like? He was big. You, okay? Yeah, yeah. Come on, let's get him. Anything? No, nothing. [ECHOING] What is that? I-I-- What is that? I don't know! Come on, let's just go. Adam, come on. [***] What is that shit? It's dinner, all right? And it'll be delicious. You know, I can't believe you took that shot. Never in a million years did I think you would do that. I feel like shit about it. You eat meat, right? I think we should go home tomorrow. No. We can't leave that deer out there. And all of a sudden why are you so anxious about going home? This was your idea. Why did you wanna come up here? Not that I mind, I've been meaning to call you, it's just-- Why? I just wanted to see the town again. After 15 years? It just seemed like the right time. You're the one who turned this into a hunting trip. I thought we could just go camping or something. I've been having these... dreams. So you wanted to come up here because of dreams? I gotta say that's a little weird. You know, Dad would have been happy about this. Why? Because I'm hunting? No, you idiot. Because... you know, no matter what, he was our dad. He was way more of a dad to you. Well you certainly didn't take the high road when he needed you, did you? He didn't need me. He had you. I had to look after him all by myself. You think that was fun? Do you really think that he would have wanted me around? I wanted you around, Adam. I wanted you there for me. For me. Can you jus-- You know what? Never mind. You know he asked about you all the time? He wanted to know what you were up to. And he hoped you would visit one last time. I came for the funeral. The fu-- The funeral? That was closure for you. I didn't come up here to defend him. That part of our lives is over. I just promised him I would make it right. And when you suggested coming up here I thought-- I thought you could close the book. You and I will never agree about our father. If you're okay with that, then I'm okay with closing the book. That looks like shit. What came between you and Dad, anyway? You. [***] [VOICES WHISPERING] [VOICES CONTINUE WHISPERING] Who are you? [GASPING] You okay? Yeah. I-I just, uh... I had a bad dream. Want your binkie? Adam, I got it. You're kidding? That's great. Let's go. Yeah. [***] CLINT: Maybe we can see something from up there. Where? Oh, shit. Come on. [***] [PANTING] What the hell? Adam. This is seriously fucked up, man. One second. No, no. No, Adam, this is a very bad idea. I recognize this place. It's, uh... [VOICES WHISPERING] Listen, I don't care. We gotta get outta here. Yeah, you're right. Let's get the hell outta here. [***] CLINT: Adam. Slow down. DISTORTED VOICE: Adam, slow down! [GROANING IN PAIN] Adam! Oh, shit! Shit! Hang on, buddy! [HOWLING IN PAIN] [GASPING] Here we go. Here we go. No, no, no! Aah! [BONE SNAPS] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [OWL HOOTING] [FIRE CRACKLING] [GROANING] What did you do? I'm sorry, bro. I had to. You wouldn't have been able to move if I didn't. You have any morphine in that pack? No, sorry. [GROANS] CLINT: What do you want? Let me get it. I got it. You can give it a try, but I wouldn't get your hopes up. Nothing. We're moving more in the open tomorrow morning. Give it another try then, all right? Sure. What the hell was that shit up there? I'm not sure, man. What? Nothing. It's just my imagination getting the better of me. What? It was just an old deer or something. Antlers were all broken and ugly. What happened to you up there? I don't know. You said you recognized the place, but you've-- You've never been there since-- Since when? You don't remember? Dad and I lost you when you were four. We were hiking and you just... disappeared. What? What happened? Nothing. Nothing happened. We-- We found you after a few hours, dad was panicking and... seriously, you don't remember at all? ADAM: No. Nothing. [***] You never did like the outdoors. I still don't. Dad just thought you were gay. [SCOFFS] What was that stupid thing dad used to say? Something about being at the office and hunting... CLINT: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. A bad day huntin' beats a good day workin' every time. I've never disagreed with him more. That's saying something. [CROWS CAWING] ADAM: What's with all these crows? [***] Adam! [SCREAMING] Adam! Adam! ADAM: What the fuck? What the fuck! What the hell was that? CLINT: We are leaving right now! ADAM: What the hell grabbed me? Come on! Was it a bear? No, no! Goddamn bear! Why won't you tell me what it was? Clint! Because I don't know, Adam! It's nothing I've ever seen before. Jesus Christ! It doesn't change the fact that we gotta get off the goddamn mountain! All right? It doesn't matter! We'd be in the same boat if it was a bear! No, we wouldn't! At least, a bear is an animal! Whatever, we gotta leave. Being scared and pissing ourselves doesn't get us off this goddamn mountain! ADAM: Do you even know where you're going? CLINT: I am just trying to get away. Farther away. ADAM: What the fuck does that mean? Well what the hell do you wanna do? Huh? You wanna-- You wanna wait for that thing to come? [VOICE ROARS] [ADAM GASPING] CLINT: Come on. Almost there. ADAM: Okay. [ADAM GROANING] [BOTH PANTING] CLINT: Come on. Sit down. [ADAM PANTING] Are you okay? Are you gonna be all right here? Yeah. If you see anything that isn't me, you shoot it. You hear me? I'll come back down. That's a good plan. Where's your phone? In the pocket of my bag. Oh, God. You good? Yeah. Okay. If you could hurry that'd be fantastic. I'm on it. [PANTING] You okay? Yeah, I'm good! [RUSTLING] [STRUGGLING GRUNTS] Goddamn cell phone. Adam! You still okay? Yeah, I sure am! Yeah, I m coming down now! [RUSTLING] Come on. Adam! I see something! What? Adam! Adam, it's coming! Where is it? [GUN SHOT] I don't see anything! Adam, it's right in front of you! Shoot! Shoot it! [SCREAMING] Holy shit! Holy shit! Oh, my God! [PANTING] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [RAPID BREATHING] Okay, okay, okay. [RAPID BREATHING] [RAPID BREATHING] [RAPID BREATHING] Okay, okay, okay, it's okay. [RAPID BREATHING] Oh, Jesus! Oh, God! Oh, God! Okay. [WHISPERING] Adam? Adam, are you-- Are you there? [WHISPERING] I'll get you out! I'll get you out! I can't. I can't. I can't. [ROAR] [RAPID BREATHING] [SHIVERING] [***] [SCREAMING] Oh, God. Oh, please. [RINGING TONE] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? S-Sophie? Hello? Who is this? Sophie, it s me-- It's me, Clint. Clint? Yes! Sophie! Sophie! Sophie-- [PHONE BREAKING UP] You're cutting in and out. Where are you? I'm sorry. Sorry for what? I can't-- I can't leave him. [PHONE BREAKING UP] Clint! Sophie? [CALL FAIL SIGNAL] No! No. [SOBBING] [***] [PANTING] Where is he? Adam, is that you? [VOICE WHISPERING] [GROANS] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [FIRE CRACKLING] You're awake. What happened? Where are we? You really think we're done with you? [GASPING] CLINT: Hey, easy. Easy Adam. Calm down. [GROANING] Calm down, bud. It's me, okay? Adam. [ADAM MOANS] ADAM: Where are we? We're almost back to the truck. How long was I out? A while. [GROANING] Are you okay? What the hell happened to me? CLINT: I don't know for sure. But you're back, all right? ADAM: I felt like-like something was trying to take me. It took me, didn't it? Oh, God. I can still feel it! Ah, ha. Come on, Clint! We have to go! Adam, listen. Listen. Listen. The quad's out of gas, but we are only a half day walk away. You just-- You just need to rest. We will leave at first light. [RUSTLING] [RAPID BREATHING] [SHRIEK] What the hell? It's that... Where are you? Where are you? [PANTING] Damn it! ADAM: Where is it? I don't know! ADAM [PANTING]: Clint! Clint! Clint, what's wrong? [GASPING] Oh, shit! Shit! [MUTTERING] [***] [PANTING] [CRYING] No! No! [SOBBING] [***] Clint! What happened? Where's your brother? He-- He-- Oh, there he is. [***] [***] Captions: Mark Perrault
