So, Ma, when are you gonna head back up to your house? - It's in Durning, right? - You've been there? - Oh, Tom drove me by once. - Oh. Well, not for another week at least. It needs work, and I haven't even called contractors or cleaners. Will you be able to afford all that? Well, your father may have abandoned us, but he did leave me some money, and it's been sitting in the bank, gaining interest while I've been... Where are you staying now? I found a nice little motel right off the highway, and the website says it's got cable. Can you stay with us, Grandma? Can you? Oh, hey, Annie, you shouldn't tell your grandma what to do, okay, sweetie? But, Tom, if Mrs. Hutchinson wa... Grandma wants to stay with us for one night, I think it'd be wonderful. Can Grandma stay with us? - Can she? Look, since Mom... Grandma already has a motel room booked, I'm sure that's probably easier for you? You know, Tom's right. I do not want to barge in. Hey, don't you worry. This isn't the last meal we'll be eating together. Yummy!- - Okay. So you make the big smile, and then you put blueberries for the eyes, like that, and the nose. - Can I do it? - Yes, of course you can. Good morning, Tom. I hope you're hungry. Look, Dad, it's a happy face pancake. Surprise. - What's she doing here? - Well, she wanted to have breakfast with Grandma, so I called. Oh, I made the coffee strong. After all that wine you had last night, I thought you might need it. Oh. I'm just fine. Thank you so much for making breakfast. Oh, you're welcome. - This looks so... - Yummy! - Yes. - And, look, Grandma says I can put cinnamon applesauce on my pancakes. Well, Grandma's really smart, because she just found a new way for you to eat your favorite food. Oh, well, my own daughter, Megan, loves cinnamon applesauce too. Well, thanks so much again. I really appreciate it. Let's eat. Yeah, let's eat. - Come on. Get over here. I want two. Oh, thank you so much. You have no idea how much it means. Yes, you too. Okay. Bye-bye. - More business stuff? - For once, no. So how's your mother doing? Her and Annie are getting along like a house on fire. Oh, yeah? Well, that's, uh, kind of what I wanted to talk to you about. I... I thought of someone who could fill in for Haley. Who'd you have in mind? No. No, no, no. Absolutely not. Tom, you didn't even let me say it. Okay, you don't have to say it. The answer is gonna be, I don't want my mother living in the house with us. She's Annie's last living grandparent. Whatever happened between you and her in the past shouldn't... Okay, yeah, stop. I'm not worried about the past. I spent a lot of years and a lot of money going to therapy to deal with the past, okay? And I'm fine with it. Honey, I know it must be difficult for her being... Very. It's very difficult, okay? My mom blamed me for the death of my sister, but that's not just it. I mean... look, I just don't trust her in the house with our daughter. Okay, here's the thing. I don't want you to get mad at me. I tracked down the psychiatric hospital that she was at, and I talked to her doctor. I told him the whole situation. That's who I was on the phone with just now. You know what he said? He said she's fine. - Fine? - Yeah, she's not a danger to herself or anyone else. Well, that's not how I remember her, okay? Okay, she had a series of breakdowns. At first, it was just depressive. Then she wouldn't leave the house for weeks. It was bad. Honey, I understand why you feel the way you do, but she's dealt with her demons. Look, if she's okay, why did she stay in the mental ward so long? Her doctor said she stayed there voluntarily. He said that she wanted to help other people that went through what she went through. Babe, look, this might be her last chance at having a family. Please? Hey, do you think I would ever endanger our daughter in any way? Of course not. - Okay. - Would it help you? - If she stayed here? - Yeah. If we could trust her, she could help out with Annie, pick her up from time to time. I could keep a close eye on her. Close eye on her? Baby, that's not why I want her to stay. Look, can we just ask her if she's even interested? - Oh. - Please? - Babe. - Please? - Oh, don't give me that smile. - For Annie. - Okay. - Yes? - Okay. - Ah! Thank you. I'm really happy that you said that. Don't make me regret this. I won't, because I'm gonna smoke you. Oh, okay, not fair. Okay, this is called casting, and it's when you attach the yarn to the needle, okay? So now bring it down, go through here, through here, and right off the thumb. See that? Want to see it again? - Yeah. - Okay, so here... You two look like you're having fun. Look, Grandma's showing me how to knit a scarf. I see that. Um, your father and I want to talk to Grandma about something. Are you going to ask Grandma to stay? Honey, you are so smart. Mom, Melissa and I would both like to ask you to stay with us for a little while, until your house is ready. Oh, Tom, thank you. Melissa, thank you. This is... this is the best news I've had in a long time. Now, this would just be for a week or two, but... Or for as long as you need. I wouldn't dream of overstaying. Grandma has to stay long enough for me to finish my scarf. Well, of course she does. Thank you for inviting me into your home, Melissa. Oh, we're happy to have you. - Hmm. - Who's that? Oh, Annie, you shouldn't grab her things. Oh, no, that's okay. That's my daughter, Megan. If she's your daughter and my dad is your son, then she's my aunt. You are so smart. Yes, she would have been your aunt. - Where is she? - Well, she had an accident, and now she's in heaven with the angels. That's so sad. I miss her every day. Grandma's never gonna lose you, Megan. I... I... I mean Annie. Annie. That's okay, Grandma. Everyone makes mistakes. Annie, we should let Grandma get settled in. Okay. Everyone makes mistakes. You can't just walk out on me and the kids!

I have games and a bouncy house for the kids and refreshments for the moms. Sounds good. You know, this is all Annie's been able to talk about for a week, and I feel like I haven't seen you or anyone for a million years. I'm really excited. Miss you. Great, I can't wait to see you.

I didn't want to ruin your dinner plans. Dinner's fine. I can use it as leftovers. Oh. I don't give her junk food on school nights. You didn't like the dress either. It's not about the dress. It's about rules and consistency with children. I... I am so sorry. I didn't... Listen, we are so very grateful to you for everything you've done with all that's happening. - We live in strange times. - We do. But I want you to know that whenever you're with Annie, I need to know where you are at all times. I will double-check with you, and I'll make sure you know where we are at all times. I'm sorry. I overreacted. - No, no, not at all. - I did. I did. I appreciate you. I'm gonna go clean up in the kitchen. Can I get you anything? No, do you... do you want some help? No, just relax. - Hey. - Hey. - You feeling any better? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I just don't think your mother has any concept of boundaries. She's a shark. Sharks don't do boundaries. They just eat all the humans and come back for dessert. Honey, she's not a shark. She's a human being who's been deeply hurt. Shark. I'll tell you what. I will speak with her and tell her she's overstayed her welcome, okay? If she's not helping you, she's just creating problems. It's not about helping me, babe. She needs a family too. I just... I wonder if maybe taking a week off might be good for everyone. A week would be a good start. Okay, I'm gonna go talk to her. Are you sure you don't want me to handle this? Yes. It was my idea. I invited her. It's my responsibility. All right. I'm good with that. Yeah, okay, I'm gonna go talk to her. I'm gonna go see if she's up. Well, good luck. - Okay. - You got this. Hey, Grandma, can I come in? Oh, Melissa, I'm so sorry. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's wrong? I... I feel terrible that I didn't call you before I took Annie out to dinner. It was so irresponsible of me. No, no, no, no, no. You don't have to cry over that. Listen, people make mistakes. It's not that big of a deal. Annie is so important to me. You and Annie are the... are the only family I have left. - And Tom. - You're my only family, and I couldn't bear to lose you. You're not gonna lose us. When we... I lost my... my Megan, she... she was only four years old. I can't imagine what that must have been like for you. That's why Annie is so important to me. Okay, look. Grandma, we love you, okay? We are really glad that you're here. You are always welcome. Do you... do you really mean that? I do. Tom and I both want you here, and if you left, you would break Annie's heart. It's so wonderful to hear. That... that makes me feel so much better. Good. Good. And I don't want you to worry anymore. I don't want you to lose sleep or get sick... - Okay. - Because Annie needs you. Not as much as I need my Annie. - Come here. - Oh. Oh. Okay. Now get some sleep, all right? Yeah. Good night. Melissa? Yeah? Thank you. Yvonne Hutchinson. You have the purple one? Yeah. - This is hard. - Oh, I know it's hard. Well, you said you wanted to help make a bracelet, right? I do. But do I have to finish now? Honey, we're almost done. Look, I'm really sorry that I haven't had time to work with you on this, okay? I've been so busy. Hi, Grandma. What are my two hard workers doing? Well, Annie's helping me make this bracelet. Ooh. Grandma, are you making cookies today? Well, I was thinking about lemon cookies, but I may need some help. I can help you. That would be so good, if it's okay with your mother. I will finish it later. Can I? Oh, honey, I don't mean to force you to do something, but you really should finish what you start. I will finish it later, honest, just not right now. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, okay. Yay! - Are you sure it's okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Just have a cookie for me. Thank you. And, you know, it'll be good for you. You'll get some work done while we have our special time. Good idea. Grandma? - What is it? - After we make cookies, can you help me find some of my toys? I can't find the Nancy the unicorn and some other stuff. What? Of course I can. Those naughty toys must be around here somewhere. Come on. Well, thank you so much for double-checking that order. I really appreciate you resending it. Uh, I'm sorry. I have to take another call, but I look forward to placing orders with you in the future. Okay. You too. Hi, this is Melissa Ferriday. Oh, I am so sorry about that. Well, I will find out what happened. Okay. Thank you. Oh, sweetheart, let me help you with those. Oh, thank you. Aren't these the art supplies for Annie's class? Wasn't Tom supposed to drop those off? Oh, yeah, he was supposed to, but he forgot. Oh. Let's just put these right into my car. I'm running some errands. I can drop them off on the way. - Oh, I don't mind taking them. - I insist. If you insist, thank you. Tom's careless. He's never been good at taking responsibility. What is that supposed to mean? Well, you know what happened to his sister. - To Megan? - Yes, my Megan. Grandma, that was a horrible accident, but it wasn't Tom's fault. You can make excuses for him all you want, but the fact is my only daughter, my Megan... Oh, my God. Oh, Melissa. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. It's just a scrape. Oh, my God. I'll get a towel. No, no, please. Just... just take the supplies to the school. I'm fine. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm sure. It's fine. Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God. I must have put it into drive in... instead of reverse. I'm so sorry. It's okay. I'm fine. It was an accident. Yeah, please don't tell Tom. He'll be so furious if he... Okay, all right, I won't tell Tom. It was an accident. Just breathe, okay? Okay. Okay. Make sure that... that you... you clean that. Okay. - I will. - All right. Just breathe. My angel is coming home. But I don't want to wear it. Don't be silly. You look beautiful. I want to wear the dress Mommy bought for me. Well, you can wear that another time. Now, stop arguing. You don't want to be late. I thought Mommy was bringing me to the party. Well, she's busy. I don't have time for this. Now, don't forget the present. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Hey, Grandma. Just reminding you that I'll be home in 15 minutes to pick up Annie for the party, okay? See you soon. Hello? Somebody ready for the party? Annie? Grandma? They look delicious. Thank you. Oh, you're so welcome. I'm a little surprised to see you. I... I thought Melissa was supposed to bring Annie. Oh, you know how plans change. She is so busy these days. I love your house. Thank you. Make yourself at home. I will. Hey, Robin. Melissa, the cupcakes are beautiful. Thank you. Uh, Grandma and Annie are there? Yes, Yvonne said you got tied up. I was really looking forward to seeing you. Melissa, are you there? Uh, yeah. Uh, something came up last minute, Robin. I, um, really wanted to be there, and I just sent Grandma in my place. I'm sorry. No, I understand. Look, I got to go. I got to get the kids. So I'll... I'll talk to you later? Okay. Have fun. Bye. Bye. Hey, so Grandma took Annie to the party without asking me. She what? This is my fault. I knew better than to let her into the house. She's not stable. Tom, this isn't your fault, okay? It's... It's just her way of getting back at me after all these years. Well, I'm not gonna let that happen. Well, I'm gonna talk to her, okay? This is the final straw. Okay, honey, just don't make a big scene. I don't want Annie to get stuck in the middle of it, okay? Can we just calm down and we'll talk about it when you get here? Let me finish up here. We can talk when I get back home. - Okay, bye. - I love you. Can I blow bubbles too, Emily? Hi, Penelope, I'm sure there's another one here. Hi, I'm Annie. I made a bubble that looked like a whale. How come you're wearing a pilgrim costume? It's not a costume. It's a dress. - Yucky. - It is not. And the clown was really funny too. - Oh, yeah? - You would have liked him. I wish you were there. I wish I would have been there too. Is Grandma okay? - What do you mean? - I don't know. She just seems to be a little weird sometimes. Did she do something weird? No. She just seems a little weird, is all. Huh. Well, everybody has bad days, right? All right. I miss Nancy. - Who's Nancy? - Nancy the unicorn. She used to go to sleep with me... - Ah. - But I think she ran off. Well, I think she'll run right back soon enough, huh? - I love you, Mom. - I love you. Now get some sleep, okay? Mmhmm. All right. Are you all tucked in? I love you. I love you too. I don't want you to get upset. I'm way past being upset. It's not that she's just disregarding everything you're asking her for whenever she feels like it. She's lying. Okay, she didn't want me to tell you this, but she almost ran me over with her car. What? When did this happen? - Today in the driveway. - Oh, man. She said it was a mistake, and I just got a little scrape, but it really scared me. Well, at the very least, then, she's a danger behind the wheel. We don't want Annie getting in the car with her. I know. I feel like this is really harsh, but I need you to ask her to leave tomorrow. Got this jewelry launch coming up. I just lost two friends. I just can't handle her being here. Say no more. Look, you don't have to worry about asking me to kick my mom out. No, no, I don't want you to kick her out, okay? Just tell her we just need a little space. Okay. I can do that. I don't know. Maybe I should do it. I don't want you to lose your temper. Lose my temper? I'm not my mother, okay? - I know. - Look, trust me here, okay? I'm not gonna lose my temper, Melissa. You promise? I promise, okay? Come here. It'll be fine. I don't want you to worry. All right. Robin, thank you so much for taking Annie to school. Oh, don't be silly. I'm glad to help. Put your seatbelt on. Do you need me to pick up Annie on the way home? Uh, no, I think Tom's gonna do it. Thank you so much, Robin. You're welcome. I'll see you later. - Have a good day. - Bye, Mom. - I love you. - Love you. - Bye, Mom. - Yeah, bye, Mom. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, mom. - Bye. - Hey. - Annie off to school? - Yeah. - Good. Tom, just don't make this get ugly, okay? It won't, okay? After my mom's gone, I can get a couple hours of work done, pick up Annie from school, take her to lunch father-daughter style, explain what happened. I'm really sorry it's come to this. It's not your fault, okay? Now, you go back outside. Get some work done. I'll handle this. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I love you. - I love you too. Hey, Mom, are you busy? We need to talk. Of course, sweetheart. Come on in. Silly, this is your house. I'm just a guest. Just folding some laundry. You don't need to do that, Mom. Oh, I want to. So, Mom, Melissa and I were... Where is Melissa? Is she working out back? Uh, yeah, she had a meeting or something. Yeah, because I saw Robin took Annie to school. Yeah, Mom. Taking care of Annie, getting to know my family, that is so important to me. Melissa and I think that's great, you know? Annie having you to get to know you, it's wonderful. Oh, getting to know Annie, that's my biggest joy. That's great, Mom, but, uh, Melissa and I, we think it's time that you move out, okay? Just for a little bit. Y... you want me to leave? At least for a little while, Mom, okay? She's just got an extremely busy schedule right now, and emotionally she's... she's going through a lot. So you want Grandma, who's helping out, to leave? Mom, we just need a little space right now. Oh, if... if I'm not wanted, I'll leave right now. Mom, come on. Don't put words in my mouth. Mom, cut it out, okay? Mom, Melissa and I aren't forbidding you to see Annie. That's exactly what you're saying. Come on, Mom, we're not. But you can't get rid of me so easily. My little girl needs me. Why, you can't take care of her. - What the hell does that mean? - Well, Melissa's too busy. You're too careless. Oh. - Megan... - Megan what, Mom? Megan's death wasn't on me. - You're as guilty... - No. As if you held her head underwater. Mom. No. No, no, no, no, you... you shouldn't be left alone with a child. Mom, listen. I was a child, Mom. When Megan died, I was a child. I was seven. And I did everything I could to try and save her. But you didn't, did you? You didn't save her. Your father was like that. He was careless and... and irresponsible, and I had to do things. I had to do... Okay, Mom, will you stop? Think about this for a second. You asked us to go outside, okay? So Megan's death is on you, not me. - No. - She died because of you. Okay? You killed her! Still careless. ♪ ♪ Okay, so I'm just gonna send you all the files I have for my website.

Thank you, and thank you for having me. I understand that you brought a very special guest to help you explain our bracelets to us. I did, I brought my daughter. She took time out of her very busy schedule to drop by. Come on. - Oh, welcome, Annie. - Hi, Kendra. So I see you guys are wearing matching bracelets. They're not matching. They're complementary. Oh, really? And what does that mean? It means that they're not identical, but they're close enough alike to give to someone you love, and they'll know and you'll know when you look at it... You're thinking of each other. That is a beautiful idea. Welcome, Melissa. Thank you, and thank you for having me. I understand that you brought a very special guest to help you explain our bracelets to us. It's so good to see you again, Doctor. I... I want you to see this. I hope you're feeling better soon, Mrs. Hutchinson. Looks like you weren't ready to go home. Oh, no, no, no, I'm glad I went home. I found Megan. Megan? Your daughter? Look, Megan. Look, you're on TV. They're not matching. They're complementary. - Hi. - What does that mean? It means that they're not identical, but they're close enough alike to... - I have one too. - Give to someone you love... and they'll know and you'll know when you look at it... You're thinking of each other. That is a beautiful idea.
