More, more, more, more... That's it! Hey, who were bringing out that little stuff? Drag it right here Note, we also have clouds That's what I mean, and we need the clouds to get through here Exactly Listen, when are you assembling the mountains? Do we need all the mountains? It's written “FOREST” on the front: it's a forest then No, it's written - 2SR, PR, L That's what it is Ok, let’s start to put up those we understood about I have a friend He has great wide fields and much livestock A day will come and my friend will die And all of his livestock will someday die I have a brother He has a big family and many children A day will come and my brother will die My father is a great warrior A day will come and he will die My mother is the most beautiful woman and she will die A day will come and I will die They're coming out Zaza, I'll meet you by the gate So let's do a quick sound test Time... Well, you know, I'm a composer, I work with time all the time I mean it's organizing sounds in space and time, and that's what you're doing as a composer, so... You know, I was diagnosed with a serious illness about seven months ago But I have no symptoms So I feel like... It's a strange situation to be in Because you feel absolutely fine, but you're told that you're dying But... I thought I was going to live forever too Until the doctor told me And then... And then you start to realize it's finite So, sometimes, when I'm taking a two-hour nap Because the medications exhaust me sometimes I feel a little guilty Because I'll never get those two hours back That's two hours off of my tab And sometimes I let a day slip by when I don't do anything productive And then I'm thinking, wow I can't believe I did that, now I let a day slip by I just assumed that once I got that diagnosis I would be in a constant state of the present But it's exhausting to live in the present all the time I think now it just feels more natural I've just gone back to my regular life, but with a little bit more urgency Unfortunately - Fellini Then, five months later - Masina Then - Andrei Tarkovsky Francesco Rosi died two years after Tonino Look how nicely you are lit up by the sun - it's marvelous! You know what this is called? This yellow stuff? Violaciocca I understood everything. There is nothing more to understand We often spoke all night And at 6 a.m. Fellini called already, so sleep was out of question Fellini had to tell his dreams This is my watch, see? They stopped at precisely that moment Not at any other moment, you understand I know, they could've stopped by themselves, but the battery was full They just did it, and... I have to be there And only write: “Tonino” We didn't get it first... Then... Then... But he wasn’t afraid to die? He was Of course What's up with this weather, right? The air is warm The air contains the scent of all that are blooming in May The days in May are long enough They're even longer in June... But when July comes, you already feel the winter Because winter is so close And when September comes... It's done We will have a sun tomorrow! Tomorrow? It would be nice Well, there is the sun now as well We just don't see it, because it's behind the clouds Starting in 1988, when Tonino moved to Pennabilli I practically lived with him I woke up and went to Tonino immediately He would say... Well, where will we go? We will go where there is NOTHING I can't find it... What are you looking for? A book about the archeological finds of Montefeltro A magazine or a book? A book, I remember, it was lying here There it is! Ohhh! My little star! Hello, my love, do you still have a fever? No Sit over there Take off your jacket Hello, let's play See how beautiful she is Don't make faces Your personalities are so similar... Whenever I take pictures of her, she always makes the worst faces in the world Seriously, now, cut it out! I cut Tonino's hair and mustache I'll drink too I also drink a little wine with you guys We took walks... During the daytime, around 3:30 or 4p.m. We made our way to Casalecchio Went to a little restaurant there And we ate papardelle It’s like tagliatelle, but wider With wild boar sauce And boar meat - there on the inside You should try it Do you miss him? It's not as an empty space inside of me, which would be too easy to say That ravine over there, it's not the entrance to hell, It’s the entrance to heaven (whispering) Should we film it or not? And now, on the 13th, there will be a camping trip in memory of Tonino Hey, what are you doing there, behind my back? Get out Tonino always told me: You are all incorrect You can never be elegant And you have to Accentuate your mistakes Don't try to be elegant It comes easily to me It's not hard at all You must write all of this down I love you so much Sisters "Beauty hides in mistakes" Yes - "in mistakes and imperfections" I want to talk about my close friend, Enrica Antonioni Oh no On your birthday it is me who should be speaking about you We lived our lives side by side Because Michelangeo Antonioni and Tonino Guerra were often together Not just when they worked together What does "TO LIVE" mean to you? To me personally? It's strange because... A few days ago, I remembered something about Michelangelo He asked me... It was one of the first questions he ever asked me Enrica, what is "TO LIVE" to you? I was 18 years old, and he was 40 years older I replied... Life is a dance... I was 18 years old A dance? Yes, when you dance... You dance with different people In different places You dance, because... You want to live! To live a life, which you don't know yet You want to experience all aspects of life Meanwhile they're singing over there... Today my answer is absolutely different If Michelangelo asked me today Enrica, what is life? I would say, life is like walking up a mountain Being present in this movement, this constant journey So you can reach a higher summit, always a higher summit Listen, could someone also go to the Tonino Guerra Association. I need the book of the Odyssey What do you need? The Odyssey book Yes... but my hair is too dirty She came from above Where the almond trees danced And put a flower between my lips As my mother had done When she put the first violet from her flowerpots Between father's lips He held it all day there Flowering between his words And your lips should tremble Well, they will tremble for the premiere He understood what "LIVING" means This word "LIVING" What does "LIVING" mean to you? Not an easy question It's a hard question, but... Living is an adventure To answer what is taking place To find an answer to everything that happens To keep going, to keep reacting Never give up Exectly - to never give up! Singing: Those like us never give up! We must sing after the performance Definitely! Let it be our hymn! Give me one... I like your jacket, I want one too, where did you get it? I'll copy it, I've been looking for one like it for a while... Ahh, yes? Those like us never give up... Gianni: Those like us don't talk much Those like uuuuuuuuus Don't ever speeeeeeeak Well, my voice has gone Let me teach you Those like us never give up... Go! Can we go? Yes, no one coming from this side What about over there? Go, go... Come on, you can go Look at this place I've brought you to How beautiful it is! Do you see, how it's beaitiful there? Over there is Old Mountain eh, life is beautiful! Is it? Tonino made these sketches, you know, kind of his diary Sketches, all these and... ...was telling me - after I'm gone, when you're bored, look in I think this is my portrait There are also Fellini's letters They're unbelievable There, Federico writes about "Amarcord" Dear Tonino, I read the Rex and School episodes I laughed until I cried, he says, and then writes Bravo, my little Tonino ...That's it Enough... I told everything... Enough Every time he performed, he began with this It was a motto, understand? You have always do something for others Because he believed that this was a meaning of life To do something for others It finally let me go, girls, it was hard... I couldn't cry Tonino... I never said this to anyone Tonino... I want to say it now Tonino - in the latest periods of his life Searched for abandoned Roman roads, He wanted to find old people who lived alone near those roads To go and talk to them He would ask: "How do you spend your days?" He wanted to know if they suffered If they were afraid of the future He wasn’t afraid, But deep inside, Tonino was always afraid of dying, Always... We're entering Tuscany We're in Tuscany already! Camera - one, one, one That's not a square over there Big passé, over the top, the second leg too I, as an artist, working on this performance I can't capture the plotline From beginning to end So, who is who, what happens because of what, why? So you come to rehearsal, and you don’t know what happens next? No. This time - we don't This is the first time we have to think, what will happen tomorrow? A beast does not understand what death mean You slaughter the beast and that is it, it dies But a person understands when you slaughter him A person does not want to die And a beast? What does it know? Yet it feels, that it coming... Before the death it becomes... ...aggressive It feels something, some possibility that the end is coming Why does the person live? So one can multiply So that the family line may continue What for to live else? There he is, my Father Coming! Where is their car? On the mountain Good day to you Good day Well, what's up guys? My name is Tania This is Zhenia Charmed This is Slava Take, take, take them Bring the horse out Take them And the little one? He is coming Stop, stay! Do you make a salted cheese? We do! Shortly you will taste it Stay So? Let me tell I wrote many, it's from my volume Tell me one Who doesn't know that in Popovka?.. How was it? How old are you? I am seventy-four How old were you when you first sat on a horse? How old? I was seven One could be an evil, just like a person One is obedient, another is not obedient We do not have black ones, the wolf ate them The wolf ate them, and now there are no black ones May God strike you Why did you not herd? I did herd, he fled May God strike you What about my son? He is fool as hell Forgive me, what fuckery there be He drinks, he drinks his whole life He drinks his whole life Had two wives, one left, second one left There is no one for me to count on What young people we have, my father chanted Our son, like an acorn, is already a burden What, pray tell, disgusts you about youth? What's it to do with the acorn? Mother chants What's it to do with the acorn? Coldly father stares, the words fly from his lips Don't you know, from an acorn an oak will spring? Do I sing it right? How old is this house, how long have you lived here? The house is a century old I have lived here for 40 years Forty two, second But you are not lonely here? The winter is mighty lonely, but otherwise... I have a wife, a woman And where? She will come from the village, in spring, the month of May Right now, it's +1 degree Celsius in the capital Ukrainian radio continues its broadcast from the Parliament session hall Colleagues Colleagues... The microphone was turned off, this wasn't part of the speech, The next draft resolution concerns canceling the Ukrainian Parliament resolution of October 6, 2016 - 32, 12, DP1 Everyone who supports this resolution in general, I ask you to vote Please, let us vote 57 vote "yes", the resolution has not passed It doesn’t want... That's how you load it... Right, right Right, let us tie it Do it, one-two Take it... So very heavy Yes it is heavy, so what? This one goes differently, Yurka, put the front here Front ahead We have not thought how we would die But if you do think about it? Are you afraid? When the candle burns down, that is when we die Anything could happened... A horse can kick you a sick dog can bite you And that is it... You die The coffin and that's it... And in you go - to the hole, they dig the hole, they cover it, and so So you think, there is nothing there? That if you die, that's it? That's it What if you knew you had only one day left? What would you do that day? I would live well What does "WELL" mean? It means - well I would buy food, I would make myself full on my last day And that is it And then the candle burns down, and in you go When you were young How did it go with the boys? Many boys admire you? Who? The boys? Yes, when you were young I had the one man only ever Then I had two daughters, and that was that Those are all my men Those are all my men My husband is dead for twenty years now And so alone am I Alone in this house I live, I work, I spin I do it to live tgrough my days I will say a truth I do not know for how am I going to live Will I live to see the evening, will I see tomorrow? Or for how long? My husband started to... There, where we keep a wood He went to mow down the field He mowed from there, where we feed the animals My daughter's son, he was fileding with him He was about five yers old I walked to the sun, to milk the cow, up there He comes running like "Grandma, come, Grandpa Kisiv fell" I come running, but it is over His eyes flung open, so is his mouth All that’s left of grandpa He lies dead I do not know, did he have time to mow from the well to the barn... Dead He did not tell me he was going to die He was not ill, all was well But he died, and that is it Later, when I die, that is how I will also be They will take me to the village, they will put me in a hole And this house will stand empty, nobody to inhabit in My sister has two sons. We have three children, I mean I do... Do any of them go to school? Sasha goes, Tanya goes, Vitaly is educated at home How do they go to school? Isn't it far? They go on foot, through the forest There is a road Are you not afraid, that they go alone through the woods? I am afraid, the wolves tread there How frightening... Yes It would scared the death out of me, I swear Well, It's prohibited to kill the wolves They cannot be shot here If it were legal, we will shoot them all My daughter walked alone to day That frightens me She walks out of the house, and who knows, if she return alive or not A wolf on the road may eat her, he may not, I do not know that This night two gave birth I will pick them up now This night? Whoa! This is how you pull it on Now it is on a safety catch Where the wolf treads, you put it on the prints he leaves So his paw is caught Like so and - so And it will be dragged by him Until he is worn down So that he is exhausted For if you tie him down in place He will chew off his own paw and walk on three I had it happen to two, they walked away without a paw Nobody has ever or will ever escape death You blink and it's over And you are not afraid? Me - no Nothing to fear there We all die We had a president who wanted to conquer our country and maybe not to die He wanted to conquer Ukraine, but had to ran to a different country But he will have to die too one day For where will he go?... To death Dying is... If you are born, you die, that is all Fuck, father, you're a right criminal That president have to see it Actually, a lot is happening around you every day To notice that moment, that's important When it's raining, you may not notice it because it's rained for three days straight And then, in a single moment You pay specific attention to this rain You see the raindrops, you see this thing It's three seconds, but they genuinely touch you, yeah? You let yourself experience every little detail And what if it's a flower? There are a million flowers around And you shift gears - and oh, a flower, and it grows so interestingly Everything around stops being important, your attention is all there So you made shoes for famous people too? For women and for men? Yes, yes, there were lots of them... The last time I made 125 pairs For the Bolshoi Theater I had a soloist from Azerbaijan She brought her old shoes over And asked for a pair just like them But I understood right away, that she was very prideful How did you understand this? Well, by her shoes Shoes tell everything about a person Show me any pair of shoes, and I will tell you everything about their wearer, their personality, what kind of a person they are Shoes do not lie, it's people who lie That's the kind of trade I'm in Pass this along Excuse me, respect to you What do these shoes tell you? Well, these shoes are very... ...Old But it looks as they were never worn though How can a person live like that? How can one live that kind of life? My father lived as he could, and maybe was happier than many others I don't like it when I immediately start to... ...think of the end result I don't know what will happen This morning, I didn't know what I would draw Then I remembered this sketch And it's like a reincarnation, because on this canvas There was a drawing of an old factory I turned the drawing around and began this I don't erase all of the traces I want... this, for example... This girl is looking down, skyscrapers here, right? And I need this theme, and then another one As if I'm sorry to cover everything with a new layer I leave it... So like in life, you let something remain, but some memories you erase completely I tell him, what don't I have? I have enough of everything No food or wine deficit, my clothes are all OK As for apples - I have a ton of those What a great ball Oh, it will be a very heavy one It should be 16 kilograms Too heavy would be bad, we won't be able to pick it up That's why it should be 16 kilograms exactly Maybe we can make it lighter? If it's too light, it will fly away from a single kick 16 means 16 So you can bear witness to this many times, so you can grow stronger So you can be happy, be fruitful, can evolve So you never lack for kindness and happiness Let the Almighty Jesus Christ help you Wait, drink some wine It's not good to lie to a priest To Georgia! To Ukraine! To Italy! I'm really Italian, I'm not joking I'm not surprised Your neighbor was Italian or something? No, the neighbor had nothing to do with it Let's fill it up and have everyone drink What are you talking about, it will hold a lot OK, quiet everyone, what the priest does is what everyone must to do as well Sure, we've taken communion already, so it's OK to die Those who have been to confession, can drink I've confessed, so I can drink ...Those no longer afraid of death A difficult fight awaits us What fight? Our village needs to win definitely ...We aren't as many as the enemy, we must be sly I don't know how, somebody needs to distract them Three Gurian brothers worked in a wheat field Their work was going well, and so they sang I love dirt When from this dirt I step out to a clean color Most of the time this clean color is blue, ultramarine Sky blue I think that blue has a depth Dirt does not This dirt is like chaos From there I go to clean lines and beauty But first I must emerge from the chaos When he came home... so he walks in like that And somehow he feels it, that there is something new on the easel I'm standing there too, and I'm interested, of course Not interested in what he will say, but in the facial expression he will have, when he looks Nico, what do you think, is it a good likeness? Well, you can recognize that it's me What? Hilarous! There is no wine, and you brought water Wine, wine, wine Isn't wine your job today? Why are you checking up on what's in my hands? Water was brought instead of wine, how can you not laugh If our hosts don't have wine, they should have said so, we would have brought it ourselves OK, the wine was in the fridge, I didn't want it to get warm Oh, now the host is looking for an excuse Finally, at last Daddy, but you said it would be a very small get-together Let's go, I'll introduce you to the film crew If you were singing your last song ever, which one would you choose? The last one ever? It's a question like... The last song? I feel that you no longer think of me, my love This is an open get-together, if anyone wants to say something you can ask for permission and say it Greetings to you all Good health to you, my dear I want to tell you about our friend, who was more than a friend Giorgi Beridze was Director of Photography He began this film with us Unfortunately, Giorgi has left us... unfortunately It has come to pass that Giorgi is not with us today And I hope...

Thank you, good health to you We would like to commemorate with a song your friend, who is our friend as well now Our life is like twilight The farther you go, the darker it grows What is our life? It will fly away like a bird What is our life? Like a bird it will fly away And night will come quicker than you expect And my life, like a bird, will fly away as well What is our life? Like a bird It will fly away And grass will cover up again the place where we lived But the grass will grow green again also after us For someone the day is shorter Even if you believed that the way is still long to go The rifle will be chewed through by rust, not earth And the life of the human heart is made shorter by grief Bottomless death will come And it will disarm you in a second, no sense in resisting And the other plot Tania is filming mom, who's gathering strawberries We're not doing a close-up? You know what was hard? He was always coming and going, coming and going When you want to say something to the person you're close to Give him more hugs, spend more time with him And there is always no time, And suddenly you understand, it's over Nobody can take anything with them to the world beyond Nobody can take anything with them Because nobody has ever done it till now My poem, my poem I must say to you I may die, but my poem will remain as a memory of me The world will rejoice and suffer will love and will part ways All will sing Even as I rot in a grave On August 17, my father died The heat was terrible - everything around on fire My dead father is lying in the middle of the room And my mother, she is a fat woman Is that like a very important detail? Let me finish So, it's hot, my mother is sitting next to my dead father Here are my sisters, my daughters-in-law And everyone is weeping hysterically, you know, as we use to do here Mom was... red all over Mom takes out her hankerchief and wipes herself And the dead man is right there Yes, her husband is lying there dead Mom is wiping away sweat, she can't handle it anymore Hey, she asks my sister When will the funeral take place already?

You want me to say it in Georgian? Yes სივრცეში სივრცეში Space? If our dad were here, what would you say? We would go eat ice cream Let's put up some clouds? Hey, where is the shore going to be?
