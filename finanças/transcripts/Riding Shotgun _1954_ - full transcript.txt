[ PLAYING WESTERN THEME ] Man: FOR THREE YEARS, I DEDICATED EVERY WAKING MOMENT OF MY LIFE TO SCOURING THE FRONTIER FOR A KILLER FOR A VERY PERSONAL REASON. I'D WORKED AT ALL KINDS OF JOBS FROM WYOMING TO OREGON. IN THE LAST YEAR, I'D WORKED EVERY STAGE LINE BETWEEN CANADA AND MEXICO, RIDING SHOTGUN. I KNEW THAT SOONER OR LATER MY PATH WOULD AGAIN CROSS THAT OF THE MAN I WANTED -- DAN MARADY. THAT'S DeLONG RIDING SHOTGUN. HERE, YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO. DAN, DO YOU THINK THIS'LL DO THE TRICK? IT COULDN'T BE A BETTER BAIT. JUST MAKE SURE HE ISN'T ON THAT STAGE WHEN IT LEAVES THE RELAY STATION. GO ON, GET GOING. YOU BOYS HANDLE DeLONG. WE'LL HANDLE THE REST. WE'LL HANDLE HIM, ALL RIGHT. Man: EACH OF THE GANG WAS WANTED BY SHERIFFS FROM THE GRAND TETONS TO THE RIO GRANDE. MARADY WAS AS CLEVER AS HE WAS RUTHLESS AND ALWAYS MANAGED TO ESCAPE CAPTURE. BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO CAPTURE MARADY. HE'S THE ONLY MAN I'VE EVER KNOWN THAT I WANTED TO KILL. HOWDY, LARRY. AFTERNOON, BOB. QUIET TRIP? MM-HMM. LIKE ALWAYS, WHEN YOU'RE ON THE BOX, EH? LAST STOP BEFORE DEEPWATER, MRS. GORHAM. LIKE TO LIGHT DOWN, STRETCH A BIT, WHILE THEY'RE CHANGING OUR TEAMS? NO, THANK YOU, MR. DeLONG. I THINK I'LL STAY WHERE I AM. I'M SO STIFF NOW I'M AFRAID IF I GOT OUT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET BACK IN. HA HA. WELL, THE ROAD'S A LITTLE BETTER FROM HERE ON IN, IF THAT'S ANY COMFORT. THIRSTY, PARTNER? YES, SIR, I SURE AM, MR. DeLONG. LET'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. MR. BOB PURDEE, MEET MR. PETER GORHAM. HOWDY. GLAD TO KNOW YOU, PETE. YES, SIR, LARRY, AND WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU GENTLEMEN? MEET MY PARTNER ON THIS RUN -- PETER GORHAM. WELL, HOWDY, PETE. HOWDY. YOU DON'T CARE WHO YOU TRAVEL WITH RUNNING AROUND WITH HIM. HE'S THE BEST SHOTGUN GUARD IN SEVEN STATES. AREN'T YOU? THE AGENT AT EAGLE PASS TOLD ME SO. HA HA. SET US UP A COUPLE OF SODAS. MY TREAT. SOMETHING FOR YOU, UNCLE? YEAH, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU GOT ANY 41 SHELLS TO FIT THIS. HMM, REGULAR RIM FIRE 41 SHORTS WOULD FIT, WOULDN'T THEY, LARRY? Larry: WHEN I SAW THAT DOUBLE-BARRELED DERRINGER I KNEW THAT DAN MARADY COULDN'T BE FAR AWAY. IT WAS HIS POCKET GUN, HIS DEADLY GOOD LUCK PIECE. YEAH, THAT'LL FIT. GIVE ME A BOX. THAT OUGHT TO TAKE CARE OF IT. Larry: I'D SEEN MARADY WIN THAT GUN AT A CONTEST, AND I'D HELPED TO BURY SOME OF THE PEOPLE HE'D KILLED WITH IT. I HAD TO FIND OUT HOW THIS OLD-TIMER GOT HOLD OF IT. LET ME SEE THAT GUN AGAIN. WHAT FOR? IT'S A NICE GUN. WHERE'D YOU GET IT? FROM A FELLA. I ONCE KNEW A FELLA WHO HAD ONE EXACTLY LIKE IT. MAYBE I BOUGHT IT FROM THE SAME FELLA. OH, NO, IT WAS HIS GOOD LUCK PIECE. HE WOULDN'T SELL IT. HIS LUCK RUN OUT ON HIM. IS HE DEAD? WASN'T THE LAST I SEEN HIM. HORSE FELL ON HIM YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, BROKE HIM UP PRETTY BAD. SO I FIGURED HE WOULDN'T NEED IT ANYMORE. CAN YOU TAKE ME TO HIM? YEAH. Larry: AT LAST I HAD WHAT I'D BEEN LOOKING FOR -- A CHANCE TO FIND DAN MARADY, THE MAN I'D SWORN TO KILL. PARTNER, KEEP OUT OF THE WAY UNTIL THEY CHANGE OUR TEAMS. SEE THAT HE GETS BACK ON THE STAGE FOR ME, WILL YOU? [ HORSE NEIGHS ] HEY, BOB, RIDE RELIEF ON INTO TOWN FOR ME, WILL YOU? WHY, SURE, LARRY. YOU GOT A HORSE? THERE'S A COMPANY SORREL WITH A WHITE MANE AND TAIL YOU CAN HAVE. THANKS. WHAT BROUGHT THAT ON? I DON'T KNOW AND DON'T CARE. ALL I KNOW IS I CAN SPEND SATURDAY NIGHT IN TOWN WITH MY WIFE. I'D ALMOST CAUGHT UP WITH MARADY AND HIS GANG TWO YEARS BEFORE IN UTAH. THIS TIME I DIDN'T INTEND TO MISS. BEFORE I WAS SADDLED, THE OLD MAN GOT ON HIS HORSE AND TOOK OFF, AS IF HE REGRETTED HIS BARGAIN, BUT I WAS DETERMINED HE WOULDN'T LOSE ME. THE OLD COYOTE COULD RIDE. HE MANAGED TO KEEP AHEAD OF ME. I BEGAN TO SUSPECT HE WAS LEADING ME INTO A TRAP, BUT I DIDN'T CARE AS LONG AS HE LED ME TO MARADY. THAT'S WHAT HATE DOES TO YOU -- IT MAKES A MAN CARELESS. HERE THEY COME. JUMP HIM FAST! DON'T GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO USE HIS GUN! WHERE IS MARADY? DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM. WE'RE TAKING CARE OF YOU. A RIFLE BULLET WOULD BE FASTER AND TWICE AS SURE. DON'T RUSH ME. I'VE BEEN BUILDING UP TO THIS A LONG TIME. DAN SAID TO FINISH HIM. ALL RIGHT, MY WAY. DAN GAVE US ORDERS. WELL, I'M GIVING THE ORDERS HERE. YOU'VE BEEN HOUNDING US, DeLONG. MY LUCK'S BEEN BAD. OR I'D HAVE HAD YOU BEFORE THIS. YOU COME CLOSE ENOUGH UP IN UTAH. YEAH, UTAH -- THAT'S WHAT I'M REMEMBERING. EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF MAKING HIS WAY ACROSS THOSE SALT FLATS. THE SUN GOT MONK OUT THERE. I WAS WITH HIM. A MAN HADN'T OUGHT TO DIE THE WAY HE DID. I WASN'T LUCKY ENOUGH TO DIE, DeLONG. FIVE DAYS AFOOT OUT THERE IN THAT SALT, MY TONGUE CHOKING ME, MY BELLY BURNING UP FROM A POTHOLE OF SOUR WATER AND THAT SUN. I WAS STILL ABLE TO GET ON MY KNEES AND BAT THE BUZZARDS AWAY, BUT YOU -- YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO GET ON YOUR KNEES. TIE HIM UP. YOU BETTER DO MORE THAN TIE ME IF YOU WANT ME OFF YOUR TRAIL AND MARADY'S. YOU'RE OFF THE STAGE. THAT'S ALL DAN CARES ABOUT. THE STAGE? HE'S AFTER THAT? HE AIN'T HERE, IS HE? WHAT'S HE OUT FOR NOW, CIGARETTE MAKINGS? HE'LL DO ALL RIGHT. WE ALL WILL. ARE YOU CRAZY? YOU COULDN'T BUY HAY FOR YOUR HORSES FOR WHAT YOU'D GET OFF THAT STAGE. MAYBE FROM THE STAGE, BUT THERE'S A BIG GAMBLING CLUB IN DEEPWATER. $30,000 TO $40,000 IN THE HOUSE ALL THE TIME. YOU FOOL. YOU RIDE INTO DEEPWATER WITH LESS THAN AN ARMY, YOU GET SHOT OUT OF YOUR SADDLES. THAT TOWN SETS A STORE BIRD'S LAWS. SHERIFF BUCK CURLEW IS TOUGHER THAN THE LOT OF YOU. GO AHEAD, GIVE DEEPWATER A CHANCE AT YOU, BUT LEAVE THAT STAGE BE. LOOKS LIKE YOU PACK ALL THE BRAINS YOU GOT IN YOUR HOLSTER. WE'RE GOING TO SHOOT THAT STAGE UP SO BAD THAT EVERY MAN IN DEEPWATER WILL LIGHT OUT WITH YOUR TOUGH SHERIFF AFTER US. WHO'S GOING TO BE LEFT TO STOP US WHEN WE DOUBLE BACK YOU TO TOWN? ALL RIGHT, GET IT OVER. PINTO WAS RIGHT. I HAD BEEN PACKING ALL MY BRAINS IN MY HOLSTER. THEY'D TRICKED ME OFF THE STAGE LIKE A TENDERFOOT. NOW ONLY YOUNG, INEXPERIENCED BOB PURDEE, RIDING SHOTGUN FOR ME, STOOD BETWEEN THE COACH PASSENGERS AND MARADY'S MURDEROUS CREW. ALL RIGHT, ACES AND EIGHTS DONE. TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH. WHERE'S MY LITTLE POCKET GUN? YEAH, WHERE IS IT, BUZZARD BAIT? I... I MUST'VE LOST IT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU LOST IT? HONEST, DAN, I HAD IT RIGHT HERE. DeLONG PUT UP A PRETTY TOUGH FIGHT. WHEN WE GET THROUGH, YOU'RE GOING TO GO BACK THERE, AND YOU BETTER FIND IT. HERE SHE COMES, DAN. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. PICK UP MY HORSE AND PICK UP YOUR HAT. [ WHISTLES ] DRIVE HER TO THE HEAD OF THAT BIG DOWNGRADE THAT LEADS INTO TOWN. MAKE SURE SURE SHE'LL ROLL IN ON HER OWN, THEN HIT THE BRUSH. PULL UP THERE UNTIL THE POSSE GOES PAST, THEN WATCH FOR US. WE'LL PICK YOU UP ON THE WAY IN. HYAH! HYAH! KEEP MOVING UNTIL AFTER SUNDOWN. LEAVE PLENTY OF TRACKS FOR THE POSSE TO FOLLOW. [ NEIGHS ] [ NEIGHS ] [ GUNSHOT ] [ WHINNIES ] I WAS IN LUCK. MY OWN 6-GUN WAS STILL WHERE IT HAD BEEN THROWN, AND THE HORSE HAD STAYED CLOSE. I HAD TO GET TO DEEPWATER FAST. THERE WAS AN OPPRESSIVE SILENCE AS I RODE INTO TOWN AND NONE OF THE USUAL SATURDAY ACTIVITY. I HEADED FOR THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE, HOPING HE OR ONE OF HIS DEPUTIES MIGHT STILL BE THERE. THE OFFICE WAS EMPTY. SHERIFF BUCK CURLEW HAD BEEN TRICKED OUT OF TOWN AS NEATLY AS I'D BEEN TRICKED OFF THE STAGE. I DIDN'T THINK HE'D DARE COME BACK HERE. THE TOWNSFOLK WERE WATCHING ME, AND I BEGAN TO SENSE THAT THEY WERE UNFRIENDLY. WITH THE SHERIFF GONE, MY NEXT MOVE WAS TO HEAD FOR THE OFFICE OF THE STAGE LINE AND TELL THEM WHAT I KNEW. WHERE YOU GOING, HONEY? THE MEN ON THE STREET WERE MOSTLY OLD OR INEFFECTUAL. IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT ALL ABLE GUNFIGHTERS HAD ALREADY LEFT TOWN WITH THE SHERIFF'S POSSE. THE HOSTILE WAY THE PEOPLE LOOKED AT ME WAS PUZZLING, BUT IT MADE ME WONDER IF I'D BEEN SMART TO USE UP MY HORSE COMING BACK HERE, INSTEAD OF TRYING TO LOCATE THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN. I RODE ON PAST THE BANK CLUB, THE GAMBLING CASINO OWNED BY COLONEL FLYNN, THE RICH PRIZE THAT MARADY HAD MARKED AS HIS TARGET. THE COACH STOOD OUTSIDE THE STAGE LINE OFFICE, BULLET-SCARRED AND BLOODSTAINED. YOUNG JOHNNY NORRIS SCUTTLED AWAY FROM ME AS IF I WERE POISON. WHAT ABOUT LAM ELLIS, THE DRIVER? HE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. LAM? WELL, HE'S STILL OUT UNCONSCIOUS. CYNTHIA, I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THE MAIL. GET IT ON OVER AT THE POST OFFICE. DO IT NOW, THEN GO ON HOME. YES, FATHER. HOW ABOUT THOSE TWO PASSENGERS, TOM? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT'S A WOMAN AND A KID THAT'S BEEN SHOT UP GOING TO REMEMBER BEYOND WHAT THEY'VE ALREADY TOLD US? IF YOU ASK ME, WE GOT ENOUGH ON HIM. WHERE'S BUCK CURLEW? WHERE DO YOU THINK? ISN'T MURPHY OR ONE OF THE OTHER DEPUTIES AROUND? SAVE IT, DeLONG. ALL WE WANT TO KNOW IS WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? AND HOW YOU GOT THAT. WELL, THAT CAN WAIT. IF THE SHERIFF'S PULLED OUT, WE'RE SHORT ON TIME. YOU MAY BE. LOOK, GET THIS THROUGH YOUR HEADS -- THE OUTFIT THAT HELD UP THE STAGE WILL BE IN HERE BEFORE DARK. WAIT A MINUTE. HOW'D YOU KNOW THE STAGE HAD BEEN HELD UP? YOU WEREN'T ON IT. DON'T RUB IT IN, TOM. I'VE BEEN HUNTING THIS BUNCH TO BE SUCKERED BY THEM, BUT I WAS. REAL FUNNY, AIN'T HE? DON'T LIE TO ME, DeLONG. THE PASSENGERS SAW YOU TALKING TO A MAN AT 20-MILE. YOU RODE OFF WITH HIM. AND THAT SAME MAN WAS IN THE BUNCH WHO HIT THE STAGE. THEY RECOGNIZED HIM. THEY MUST'VE MISSED YOU. MAYBE THE WOMAN AND KID MISSED YOU, BUT IT LOOKS LAM ELLIS OR BOB PURDEE DIDN'T. PITY YOU DIDN'T GET IT IN THE BELLY LIKE BOB PURDEE DID. BOB PURDEE...DEAD? YOU OUGHT TO KNOW. YOU THINK I -- YOU MULE HEADS. I DIDN'T RIDE IN HERE TO STAND TRIAL IN FRONT OF YOU OR ANYONE ELSE. I'M TRYING TO SAVE COLONEL FLYNN WHATEVER HE'S GOT IN HIS CLUB AND YOU YOUR HIDES. OH, SO YOU WANT US TO CALL THE SHERIFF AND THE POSSE BACK IN, SO THAT THE HOLDUP GANG CAN GET AWAY? NONE OF YOU WANTS THAT OUTFIT AS BADLY AS I DO. YOU'RE PACKING A GUN, DeLONG, AND I KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT. BUT YOU'RE A ROTTEN, LYING KILLER -- ANYBODY ELSE GOT ANYTHING TO SAY? DO WHAT YOU WANT TO, BUT I'M GOING AFTER BUCK CURLEW AND HIS POSSE. IF YOU HADN'T FIRED ME AND GIVEN MY JOB TO THAT OUTLAW, THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. I'D HAVE BEEN ON THAT STAGE. SHUT UP. I'M TIRED OF YOU YELPING ABOUT LOSING YOUR JOB. DeLONG'S NOT GOING TO GET AWAY WITH THIS. Larry: I HAD TO GET THAT POSSE BACK TO TOWN, BUT FIRST I WANTED TO SEE THE WIDOW OF BOB PURDEE AND TELL HER HOW BAD I FELT ABOUT BOB'S DEATH. THERE HE IS, MRS. PURDEE. Mrs. Purdee: YOU DID IT! HE'S DEAD! YOU'RE THE REASON HE'S DEAD! AND I'M AWFULLY SORRY. YOU KILLED MY BOB! MRS. PURDEE -- HE'S DEAD BECAUSE OF YOU! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU! I'M GOING TO -- [ GROANS ] OH, BOB. BOB. OH, BOB. I KNEW THAT IF I'D BEEN ON THAT STAGECOACH HER HUSBAND WOULD STILL BE ALIVE. AT LEAST MRS. PURDEE HAD GOOD CAUSE TO HATE ME, BUT THE REST OF THE TOWN, WITH LESS REASON, HAD ALREADY TRIED ME AND FOUND ME GUILTY. I FELT LIKE A MAN WALKING TO THE GALLOWS. ORISSA, DON'T. THINK OF YOURSELF. YOU CAN'T TALK TO HIM NOW. NOT IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY LIKE THIS, NOT AFTER WHAT HE'S DONE. HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING. I KNOW HE HASN'T. YOU SAW THE STAGE WHEN IT CAME INTO TOWN. DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH -- EVEN THE KIDS HAD ME MARKED AS A MONSTER. BUT I WAS ONLY GLAD I HADN'T FIRED BEFORE IDENTIFYING YOUNG NORRIS, WHO USED TO THINK I WAS A HERO. IF I'D ONLY BEEN ON THAT STAGE -- I THOUGHT YOU WERE, LARRY. THE FIRST THING WE HEARD WAS THAT THE GUARD WAS DEAD. I THOUGHT THEY MEANT YOU. I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD. SOME OTHERS THOUGHT I'D BE BY NOW. Man: LARRY! HELLO, ORISSA. AM I GLAD YOU SHOWED UP. I WAS ON MY WAY TO SEE YOU, DOC. HOW IS LAM ELLIS? STILL UNCONSCIOUS, GOT A NASTY LEAD SLAP ALONGSIDE THE HEAD. AND THE PASSENGERS? WOMAN'S GOT A PERFORATED EXTENSOR, HOLE IN HER ARM. BULLET JUST NICKED THE BOY, NOTCHED HIS EAR. HE'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE A RUSTLER FROM HERE ON OUT, BUT BOTH ARE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. I'M GLAD THERE'S SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT IT. DOC, I WANT YOU AND ORISSA TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME. WELL, SURE, LARRY, WHAT IS IT? THE OUTLAW BUNCH THAT HELD UP THE STAGE IS HEADING BACK IN HERE. I WANT YOU TO CONVINCE THE FATHER TO CLOSE UP AND PREPARE FOR THE VISITORS. THEY'RE GOING TO HOLD UP THE CLUB? YOU'RE SURE, LARRY? ARE YOU GOING TO WASTE TIME ASKING QUESTIONS, TOO, DOC? BIGGERT, HUH? HE'S BEEN MAKING A LOT OF TALK ABOUT YOU SINCE THE STAGE CAME IN, SOME OF THE OTHERS, TOO. YOU TWO MAY TALK, THEN, TO ORISSA'S FATHER. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? PICK UP A FRESH HORSE AND GO AFTER BUCK CURLEW AND HIS POSSE. TAKE MY ADVICE AND DON'T TRY TO LEAVE TOWN. THEY'LL SAY YOU'RE RUNNING. I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY, SO LONG AS I GET THE POSSE. DOC, WALK ORISSA OVER TO THE BANK CLUB AND KEEP YOUR EYE ON HER TILL I GET BACK. ALL RIGHT, LARRY, BUT I WISH YOU'D LISTEN. LATER, DOC. HOWDY, SAM. I WANT A HORSE,, GRAIN-BOTTOMED AND SHOD FOR A HARD RIDE. ALMOST EVERY MAN ANY GOOD WITH A GUN RODE OUT WITH THE SHERIFF, CLEANED ME OUT OF EVERY CRITTER FIT TO RIDE. SORRY, LARRY. WHAT ABOUT THOSE -- BROKEN LEGS? I SAID I WAS SORRY, LARRY. [ MEN SINGING SPANISH ] I COULD'VE TAKEN THAT SHOTGUN AWAY FROM LEWELLYN AND WRAPPED IT AROUND HIS FAT EARS, BUT IT MIGHT'VE MEANT SHOOTING SOME MISGUIDED PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THE RIGHT THING WAS TO KEEP ME IN TOWN. THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON LEFT WHO MIGHT HELP ME -- FRITZ, WHO RAN A DIRTY LITTLE CANTINA WHICH FEW SELF-RESPECTING PEOPLE EVER ENTERED. HE'D DO ANYTHING FOR A FAST DOLLAR. [ MEN STOP SINGING ] WELL...MR. DeLONG. COME IN. COME IN. YOU DO US AN HONOR, YES, SIR. HOW ABOUT A DRINK? NOT THAT, FRITZ. MAKE MINE WHISKEY. HOW'S YOUR FAMILY? GOOD, EATING ME OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME. BUSINESS SHOULD BE AS GOOD AS THOSE KIDS. TALK ABOUT BUSINESS -- THERE WAS A BAD ONE ON THE STAGE TODAY. [ MEN RESUME PLAYING ] IT'S A LONG TIME SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN HERE, MR. DeLONG. SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT. YOU SEE IT? SHIPPED ALL THE WAY FROM KANSAS CITY. VERY EXPENSIVE. A MAN AT THE BAR LIKES TO LOOK AT HIMSELF WHILE HE TAKES HIS DRINK. WHAT IS BETTER TO LOOK AT THAN HIMSELF? MY FRAU CARMELITA -- SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THIS. SHE SAYS I TAKE FOOD FROM THE MOUTHS OF THE NIÑOS FOR THIS GLASS -- RIGHT FROM THE TABLE. I'M TELLING YOU -- WOMEN ARE A GREAT TROUBLE. FRITZ, CAN YOU GET ME A HORSE? A HORSE? FOR YOU I CAN GET 10 HORSES. ONE IS ENOUGH. IT WILL COST SOMETHING. UM, I THINK $2 FOR THE DAY. THANK YOU. MY SON PABLO IS GOOD AT THIS SORT OF THING. I CALL HIM, HUH? PABLO. PABLO! SCHNELL, KOMM HER AN. WHAT COLOR HORSE DO YOU WANT? HANG THE COLOR. GET ME A GOOD ONE, BUT DON'T LET ANYONE KNOW WHO IT'S FOR. OH, DON'T WORRY. I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THESE THINGS. AHH, PABLO. UN CABALLO PARA ESTE HOMBRE. PRONTO, A LA PUENTE DE ATRáS. YEAH, PAPA. [ Speaks German ] MAYBE YOU FORGOT -- YOU COULD HAVE GOT A HORSE FROM THE LIVERY STABLE. I TRIED. I THINK MAYBE THIS HORSE IS GOING TO COST $3. GRACIAS. NECESITO DINERO, FRITZ. EL DINERO, EL DINERO, FRITZ. MONEY YESTERDAY, MONEY TODAY, MONEY TOMORROW. QUIERO DINERO POR UN GALóN DE LECHE, 25 LIBRAS DE FRIJOLES, UNA CAJA DE CHILE, UN SACO DE HARINA Y CARNE PARA LOS FRIJOLES. FOOD, FOOD, FOOD. DON'T THEY DO ANYTHING BUT EAT? GIRLS AT THAT. Y QUé HAY DE TENERIJAS? ELLA NO LE GUSTA CHILE DE LATA. ELLA NO LE GUSTA CARNE DE LATA. ELLA TIENE QUE TENER PIMIENTOS AUN CON SU TORTILLAS. ELLAS LE GUSTAS CHILE EN LA SOPA. [ SPEAKING GERMAN ] 15 YEARS I'M MARRIED TO HER, AND ONLY ONE BOY. SUCH LUCK NOBODY SHOULD HAVE. I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I GET SO UPSET, I DON'T KNOW WHAT LANGUAGE I'M TALKING. AQUí TIENES. TOMA. TOMA. MONEY, MONEY. HOW CAN A MAN HAVE SO LITTLE BUSINESS AND SO MANY KIDS? WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THAT HORSE, SON? THIS HORSE? IT IS FOR MY PAPA. I THOUGHT SO. TELL FRITZ HE CAN WALK WHEREVER HE'S GOING. TWO MEN -- THEY TOOK THE HORSE FROM ME. THERE ARE SOME HORSES HAD TO HIT TRACKS ON THE STREET IF A MAN WAS IN A HURRY. YEAH. WEAR YOUR GUN. EVERYBODY IS AFRAID OF LARRY DeLONG'S GUN. YOU COULD TAKE THE BEST HORSE AND YOU'D BE GONE... LIKE THAT. LIKE THAT, BUT SOME FOOL WOULD TRY TO STOP ME, AND I'D HAVE TO KILL HIM. YOU GO ON HOME, HUH? HEY, TUB, HOW IS THE POSSE DOING? ANY SIGN OF THE ROAD AGENTS? YEAH, TRACKS. BUCK IS STILL TAILING THEM WITH THE REST OF THE FELLOWS. IF YOU ASK ME, HE'LL STILL BE TAILING THEM WHEN HIS SADDLE IS WORE OUT. WELL, NOBODY IS ASKING YOU. BUCK WILL FIND THEM. HE'S GOOD AT READING SIGNS. HAS ANYBODY SEEN LARRY DeLONG? YEAH, HE'S HERE. WHERE IS HE? OVER IN THE CUEVO JOINT. GOING TO LOCK HIM UP, TUB? BUCK SAID TO FIND HIM. IT'S ABOUT TIME. IF IT WASN'T FOR ME AND LEWELLYN, YOU'D FIND NOTHING HERE BUT MORE TRACKS. HE SENT FRITZ'S KID OUT FOR A HORSE. WE CUT HIM OFF. I GOT LEWELLYN KEEPING HIS EYE ON THE BACK DOOR. AND HE TRIED TO GET A HORSE OFF OF ME, TOO. JUMPY, AIN'T HE? HE OUGHT TO BE. HE'S REAL RINGY, TOO. BEAT TOM BIGGERT HALF TO DEATH FOR JUST ASKING A FEW QUESTIONS. WELL, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. HE KNOCKED POOR MRS. PURDEE DOWN ON THE STREET AND DREW ON THE NORRIS KID A LITTLE WHILE AGO. PLAIN NEAR SHOT HIM IN COLD BLOOD. YOU'VE GOT A BIG TRAP. NOW KEEP IT SHUT AND LET ME HANDLE THIS 'CAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY. THERE'S TWO OF US. THAT'S LARRY DeLONG. FRIEND OF YOURS, AIN'T HE? WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO HANDCUFF THEM, NOBODY IS YOUR FRIEND. I FELT BETTER WHEN I SAW TUB MURPHY APPROACHING. HE WAS THE SHERIFF'S CHIEF DEPUTY AND AN ALL RIGHT GUY. [ SPEAKS SPANISH ] TUB, I'M SURE GLAD TO SEE YOU. YEAH, ME, TOO, LARRY. BUCK TOLD US TO FIND YOU, BUT IT WAS KIND OF HARD KNOWING WHERE TO LOOK. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST, DeLONG. NO, NO, NO, NO -- NO CHARGE. JUST, SORT OF, FOR QUESTIONING. ALL RIGHT, WHEN YOU GET BUCK IN HERE. I GOT TO SEE HIM FAST. WELL, LARRY, BUCK IS NOT APT TO GET BACK BEFORE MORNING. HE'S HOT ON THE TRACK OF THOSE ROAD AGENTS. HE'S HOT ON THE TRACKS OF A BUNCH OF LOOSE HORSES BEING DRIVEN BY ONE MAN, IF YOU ASK ME. HE'S GOING TO BE SNOOKERED AS NEAT AS I WAS AT 20-MILE. HE'S GOT TO GET HIS POSSE BACK HERE BEFORE THAT GANG HITS TOWN. YOU THINK BUCK CURLEW WOULD BE CRAZY ENOUGH TO PULL THE POSSE IN AND THEN LET THAT BUNCH ESCAPE ON YOUR SAY-SO? OH, SHUT UP, ROSS. LARRY, WE'VE GOT OUR ORDERS. ANYTHING ELSE IS UP TO BUCK WHEN HE GETS BACK. TUB, LISTEN, I'VE TRIED TO TELL EVERYBODY ELSE. AT LEAST YOU'LL BELIEVE ME. THAT STAGE BUSINESS WAS A TRICK TO PULL THE SHERIFF OUT OF TOWN. THAT OUTFIT AIMS TO CLEAN OUT THE BANK CLUB. ARE YOU SURE? GET BUCK AND HIS POSSE BACK, OR YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT. BUCK SAID LOCK HIM UP. WE'VE GOT TO DO THAT FIRST, AND BUCK TOLD US TO STAY HERE. HE WON'T LIKE IT IF WE HEAD BACK TO WHERE HE IS AFTER THAT. WHO CARES WHAT BUCK LIKES? YOU WANT TO RISK A CHEWING OUT FOR DISOBEYING ORDERS OR YOU WANT TO SEE THIS TOWN SHOT TO PIECES WITHOUT HALF ENOUGH GUNS TO DEFEND ITSELF? HE TELLS IT REAL SCARY, DON'T HE? QUIT STALLING, DeLONG. YOU'D BETTER COME ALONG, LARRY. I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO DRAW, ESPECIALLY AGAINST THE LAW, BUT NOBODY WAS GOING TO TAKE MY GUN AWAY FROM ME. TELL THOSE ALLIED RUBBERNECKS TO GET OUT FROM BEHIND YOU, TUB. LOOKS LIKE THIS IS GOING TO BE UP TO BUCK, TOO. I'D BETTER SEND FOR HIM. PUT ME DOWN! I JUST GOT A HOLE IN MY ARM. GO GET DOC WINKLER. WE'LL TAKE HIM OVER TO MY OFFICE, THEN DOC CAN FIX HIM UP THERE. YOU JELLY BELLY. WE'D HAVE HAD THEM IF YOU'D BACKED ME UP. IF IF HAD, WE'D HAVE BOTH BEEN DEAD. TRYING TO USE BUCK'S OLD DEPUTIES TO TRICK THE POSSE OFF THE TRAIL OF THOSE ROAD AGENTS. YOU'RE FAST, ROSS. WITH HALF A CHANCE, YOU COULD HAVE NAILED HIM. PITY YOU DIDN'T. I GET THIS ARM FIXED UP, I'LL NAIL HIM YET. DIDN'T GIVE YOU AN OLD FAIR WARNING AT ALL, DID HE? YOUR BADGE DOESN'T MEAN NOTHING TO HIM. I TRIED TO TELL YOU, TUB. HE'S GOING TO KILL HIM FOR SURE. WE HEARD SHOOTING. WHAT HAPPENED? THAT SHOTGUN GUARD OF YOURS JUST PLUGGED ROSS HUGHES WHEN HIM AND TUB WENT INTO THAT CUEVO JOINT. HOW BAD? LOOKS PLENTY BAD. OH, IT'S NOTHING BUT A HOLE IN HIS ARM. HE'S LUCKY IT WASN'T IN HIS HEAD. WHY DIDN'T HE GET YOU, TOO? MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I WASN'T FOOL ENOUGH TO DRAW ON HIM. ROSS GOT WHAT WAS COMING TO HIM. HE ASKED FOR IT. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CHARGES AGAINST LARRY. HE'S GOT A RIGHT TO DEFEND HIMSELF. NO MAN HAS A RIGHT TO FIRE ON THE LAW. NOT IN THIS TOWN. IN BUCK CURLEW'S ABSENCE, YOU'RE ACTING SHERIFF. I KNOW, MR. WALTERS. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT, TUB? YOU GOING IN THERE AND GET THAT KILLER? I THINK I'LL GO GET MYSELF SOME CHOW. TELL THE DOC I WANT TO SEE HIM WHEN HE GETS THROUGH WITH ROSS. LOOK, TOM, YOU GOT TO HIRE ANOTHER GUARD. HOW ABOUT GIVING ME ANOTHER CHANCE? GET THOSE HORSES OUT OF THERE. COUPLE MORE OF YOU MEN GET AROUND BACK AND KEEP WATCH WITH LEWELLYN. DeLONG MAY MAKE A RUN FOR IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK, MR. WALTERS? NO DOUBT OF IT, TOM. DeLONG WAS IN WITH THAT STAGE GANG. YOU OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER THAN TO HIRE HIS KIND OF GUN. DON'T DRAG ME INTO THIS, MR. WALTERS. WHEN YOU HIRE A GUN, YOU'VE GOT TO HIRE A MAN TO GO ALONG WITH IT. Larry: MANNING DIDN'T KNOW I DECIDED SOME TIME AGO AGAINST USING ANY OF THOSE HORSES. AS I DREW MY GUN TO RELOAD, HE THOUGHT I MEANT TO SHOOT HIM, AND HE GREW FRANTIC. [ HORSES NEIGHING ] THREE OF THEM OUT THERE WITH GUNS. SORRY, FRITZ, I DON'T SEEM TO BE DOING YOUR BUSINESS ANY GOOD. OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. YOU'RE THE ONLY MAN IN TOWN WHO DOESN'T THINK SO. HEY, LOOK, I'VE HAD A FRIEND IN TROUBLE A TIME OR TWO BEFORE. A MAN HAS TO HELP HIS FRIENDS, OR HE'S NOT A MAN. ISN'T THAT RIGHT? I WOULDN'T KNOW. I SEEM TO BE KIND OF SHORT ON FRIENDS. MAYBE I'M CRAZY WITH ALL THOSE KIDS, AND THIS GLASS TO PAY FOR, BESIDES, BUT I HELP MY FRIENDS. THIS BUSINESS YOU TOLD OF MURPHY -- THAT THE SHERIFF IS FOLLOWING NOTHING BUT THE TRACKS OF LOOSE HORSES -- AND THE OUTLAWS INTEND TO COME IN HERE WHILE THE BOSS IS GONE, IS THAT RIGHT? HOW DO YOU KNOW? BECAUSE SOME OF MARADY'S MEN TOLD ME. OH, YOU'RE IN REAL TROUBLE, BUT I'M GOING TO HELP YOU GET OUT OF TOWN WHILE YOU STILL GOT A CHANCE. HOW? LEAVE THAT TO ME. I WON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'VE GONE. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING. THE SHERIFF'S GOING TO BE SUSPICIOUS WHEN HE GETS BACK, AND HE MIGHT MAKE IT HARD FOR ME. STILL, I FIGURE I CAN TAKE THE RISK IF YOU -- I-I HEAR THERE WAS OVER $1,000 IN CASH ON THAT STAGE TODAY. YOU FILTHY LITTLE BLOB OF DIRT. DO YOU THINK I'D HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH DAN MARADY? MY FRIEND, ARE YOU? YOU THINK I'D PUT A COACHLOAD OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN RANGE OF THOSE BLOODY KILLERS? SO I'M ONE OF THE MARADY GANG, AM I? AND YOU WANT YOUR WAG-UP FOR WHAT YOU THINK I GOT FROM THE EXPRESS BOX, DO YOU? I'LL GIVE YOU A WAG-UP, ALL RIGHT. Larry: IT TOOK ALL MY CONTROL TO KEEP FROM ANSWERING THEIR STUPIDITY WITH LEAD. THAT WAS A SMART STUNT. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO TAKE A STAND. HOW FAR DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DRIVE A MAN LIKE LARRY? TUB BETTER GET OUT HERE BEFORE SOME OTHER FOOL MAKES A BIG BRAVE AND GETS HIMSELF KILLED. Larry: THE WORST ELEMENTS IN TOWN WERE BEGINNING TO ENJOY THE SITUATION. HOWDY, FOLKS. HOW'S ROSS? BUSTED ARM. I SENT HIM BACK OUT TO HIS RANCH. OH, THANKS. TUB, YOU GOT NO BUSINESS IN HERE. IT'S EATING TIME, DOC. YOU KNOW I GOT A BUM STOMACH. EVER HEAR OF NERO, TUB? HE FIDDLED WHILE HIS TOWN BURNED UP. ARE YOU CROWDING ME, DOC? TAKE A LOOK OUT THERE. YOU HEARD THE TALK GOING AROUND? IN BUCK CURLEW'S ABSENCE, YOU'RE THE LAW. I KNOW, BUT -- SOME OF US IN THIS TOWN THINK A LOT OF OUR LAW. IT TOOK US A LONG TIME TO GET IT ESTABLISHED. YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING SITTING IN HERE. OH, TAKE IT EASY, DOC. THOSE BOYS WILL BE GOING ALONG HOME PRETTY SOON. I'M NOT SO SURE. THE DRIVER LAM ELLIS HAS FINALLY COME TO. HE SAID HE RECOGNIZED THE LEADER OF THE ROAD AGENTS THAT HIT HIS STAGE. YEAH? WHO? DAN MARADY. THAT'S RIGHT. MARADY. IS HE SURE? POSITIVE. COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE? THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S NO MISTAKE. JUST NOW DeLONG CONFESSED TO ME THE BANDITS WERE THE MARADY GANG. HE SAYS HE KNOWS THE WHOLE BUNCH. HOW COULD HE KNOW? RIGHT NOW YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT TO FIGURE OUT. PRACTICALLY ADMITTED BEING ONE OF THE GANG. MUST HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM ALL ALONG. THE WORST KILLER CREW IN THE COUNTRY. WE GOT TO GET HIM OUT OF THAT CANTINA. YOU'RE RIGHT, OR SOMEBODY ELSE IS SURE GOING TO GET KILLED. WHAT ARE YOU FOOLING AROUND WITH THAT ROPE FOR, HONEY? DON'T YOU LIKE ME ANYMORE? GOT A REAL BAD ONE THIS TIME. ONLY ONE WAY TO HANDLE HIM. LAY OFF, TOM. I'M IN CHARGE HERE. THEN WHY DON'T YOU DO SOMETHING? YEAH, LIKE GETTING DeLONG OUT OF THAT CUEVO JOINT BEFORE HE SHOOTS UP THE WHOLE TOWN. BEN HAD AN IDEA, TUB. YOU GET A COUPLE OF BOYS WITH LASSOES UP ON THAT BALCONY, THEN TRICK DeLONG OUTSIDE, THEY COULD DROP THEIR LOOPS OVER HIM. THAT'LL STOP THAT QUICK DRAW OF HIS. YOU'RE CRAZY, ALL OF YOU. WHO'S GOING TO RISK A LOOP AGAINST DeLONG'S GUNS? LIKE THUNDER RACING, HE'LL THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO HANG HIM. NOW THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY. LARRY -- LARRY, YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE. CONVINCE THEM OF THAT. LARRY, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT USING ROPE. BETTER SEND SOME OF THESE HOTHEADS OVER TO WATCH THE SALOONS AND THE BANK CLUB. YOU DIDN'T JUST SWALLOW DeLONG'S CLAIM ABOUT MARADY COMING TODAY, DID YOU? WHY NOT? HE MAY BE RIGHT. MARADY HAS ALWAYS WORKED THAT WAY. HE HITS A STAGE, A RELAY STATION, A RANCH, AND SHOOTS IT UP AS BRUTALLY AS HE CAN TO DRAW A POSSE FROM A NEIGHBORING TOWN. THEN WHEN THE TOWN'S UNPROTECTED, HE RAIDS IT. HALF THE BANKS IN WYOMING HAVE BEEN BUSTED THAT WAY. YEAH, BUT THIS AIN'T WYOMING, DOC. USE HORSE SENSE. MARADY WOULDN'T SEND A MAN IN HERE TO WARN US IF THAT WAS HIS PLAN. HE WANTS TO GET THE POSSE OFF HIS TRAIL, SO HE SENT DeLONG IN. COULDN'T BE PLAINER IF IT WAS SPELLED OUT FOR YOU. TAKE MY ADVICE AND LEAVE LARRY WHERE HE IS. LEWELLYN AND A COUPLE OF THE BOYS ARE GUARDING THE BACK DOOR. RIGHT. IF WE OPEN FIRE FRONT AND BACK, WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FLUSH HIM OUT. DeLONG CAN'T SHOOT TWO WAYS AT ONCE. THE DEVIL HE CAN'T. DID YOU SEE HIM AT THAT BAR IN RODEO? GOT A BETTER ANSWER, TUB? YUP. LIKE THE DOC SAYS, LEAVE HIM RIGHT WHERE HE IS UNTIL BUCK GETS BACK. ONE MAN -- A RENEGADE KILLER HOLDING AUTHORITY, THE WHOLE TOWN AT BAY. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE'D BE ABLE TO KEEP ORDER IF HE GOT AWAY WITH THAT? I REMEMBER HIM -- THAT FELLOW WITH A ROPE. LAST YEAR WHEN THEY LYNCHED THAT RUSTLER UP IN WADE COUNTY HE'S THE ONE WHO MADE THE NEWS. ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE ACTION OR NOT? ALL RIGHT, BUT NO ROPE. GET THAT STRAIGHT -- NO ROPE. I WON'T STAND FOR IT. WELCH, YOU AND MILLER TAKE YOUR RIFLES AROUND BACK. FIND LEWELLYN AND TELL HIM TO HOLD HIS FIRE UNTIL HE GETS A SIGNAL FROM ME. COUPLE OF MORE OF YOU, GET OVER HERE BEHIND THE WATER TROUGH. THE REST OF YOU, CLEAR OUT OR TAKE COVER. PUT THAT ROPE DOWN AND GET OUT OF HERE. YOU GIRLS GET BACK OUT OF THE WAY. YOU'RE GOING TO SHOOT UP MY PLACE OF BUSINESS? YEAH. OH, NO, MR. SHERIFF. DON'T DO THAT, PLEASE. MY WIFE, MY FAMILY, MY KIDS -- [ SPEAKING GERMAN ] TALK ENGLISH. HAS LARRY GOT YOUR KIDS IN THERE? [ SPEAKING GERMAN ] ANSWER ME. ARE YOUR KIDS IN THERE? OH, NO, NOT THE KIDS. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. THE GLASS, THE EXPENSIVE MIRROR -- NONE OF IT GET PAID FOR. [ SPEAKING GERMAN ] EVERYTHING BREAK. THE BOTTLES BREAK, BREAK, BREAK. YOU STARTED THIS BY SHOOTING OFF YOUR MOUTH ABOUT LARRY BEING PART OF MARADY'S GANG. NOW GET OUT OF HERE. GO ON, GET OUT OF HERE. OH, NO, MR. SHERIFF. NO, MR. SHERIFF, PLEASE. SHERIFF, WAIT A MINUTE. THERE'S A GIRL IN THERE WITH LARRY DeLONG. THE CASHIER FROM THE BANK CLUB. ORISSA. I SEEN HER SNEAK IN THERE, TOO. THE LITTLE FOOL. SOMEBODY GET ORISSA'S FATHER. HE'S AT THE CLUB. WELL, ONE THING'S SURE -- WE CAN'T SMOKE LARRY OUT WHILE SHE'S IN THERE WITH HIM. CALL TUB MURPHY IN HERE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. LARRY, GIVE YOURSELF UP. FOR WHAT? ROBBERY? MURDER? FOR DAN MARADY'S DIRTY WORK? MARADY? SO IT IS TRUE. YOU DO KNOW WHO THEY ARE. SURE, I KNOW. LET'S YOU AND DOC GET YOUR FATHER TO CLOSE UP HIS CLUB. HE THINKS YOUR WHOLE STORY IS A TRICK OF SOME SORT. HE SAID THE OUTLAWS MUST HAVE WARNED YOU TO GET OFF THAT STAGE, OTHERWISE THEY'D HAVE SHOT YOU OFF. THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR A MAN WHO WANTED TO GET RID OF ME ANOTHER WAY. DO YOU THINK I'VE BEEN RIDING SHOTGUN BECAUSE I LIKE IT? GOING FROM ONE STAGE LINE TO ANOTHER, A PROFESSIONAL TARGET FOR THE FIRST OUTLAW BULLET IN ANY HOLDUP? UP IN WYOMING THREE YEARS AGO, MARADY HELD UP ANOTHER STAGE WITH A WOMAN AND A BOY RIDING IN IT. THE BOY AND THE MOTHER WERE KILLED. THE BOY'S NAME WAS LARRY, NAMED FOR ME. HIS MOTHER WAS MY SISTER. [ GUNSHOT ] YOU OLD FOOL! YOU'VE HAD COBWEBS IN THAT GUN FOR OVER 50 YEARS. NOW IF YOU FIRE IT AGAIN, I'LL TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU. YOU KNOW THAT GIRL IS IN THERE. COLONEL FLYNN! GET YOUR DAUGHTER OUT OF THERE. DAD! GET OUT OF HERE, ORISSA. BUT, DAD, PLEASE LISTEN. LARRY HAS BEEN TELLING US THE TRUTH. WE'RE ALL IN DANGER. GET OUT OF HERE. IT'S NO USE, DeLONG. YOU'D LIKE ME TO EMPTY THE SQUARE OUT THERE SO YOU CAN MAKE A BREAK FOR IT. YOU'D LIKE ME TO LOCK EVERYBODY UP IN MY CLUB WAITING FOR A RAID THAT ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU GOT YOURSELF INTO THIS. YOU CAN GET YOURSELF OUT. YOU COMING WITH ME? NO. IF THEY COME IN HERE AFTER LARRY, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE ME, TOO. IT WON'T HELP, ORISSA. IF REASON WON'T WORK, ALL I HAVE LEFT IS MY GUN. YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO USE IT, BUT IF I HAVE TO I COULDN'T RISK IT WITH YOU IN HERE. BUT, LARRY -- IT WON'T WORK, HONEY. THAT GUN ISN'T MUCH USE TO A DEAD MAN, DeLONG. IF I WERE YOU, I'D GIVE MYSELF UP. IF I WERE YOU, I'D ARM MY DEALERS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE COMPANY. FROM THE COLONEL'S VIEWPOINT, HIS ADVICE WAS SENSIBLE. FROM MINE, IT WAS AN INVITATION TO SUICIDE. I SIMPLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND ORISSA. I TOLD HER SHE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE SEEN WITH THAT MAN, AND SHE HAS THE NERVE TO GO RIGHT INTO THAT PLACE AFTER HIM. SHE'S BRAZEN. SHE'S AS BRAZEN AS HE IS, COMING BACK TO TOWN AND THINKING HE CAN GET AWAY WITH SUCH TRICKERY. IT'S EXCITING, THOUGH, ISN'T IT? YES. ALL RIGHT, DEPUTY. THE COLONEL AND THE GIRL ARE CLEAR. WE'RE ALL SET, TUB. FRONT AND BACK. NO, SHERIFF! DON'T DO THIS. YOU WILL RUIN ME. I WILL HAVE NOTHING. ARE YOU GOING TO SHUT UP? WHAT ABOUT IT? HERE. HOLD IT, MEN. HOLD IT. YOU'D BETTER KEEP OUT OF THE WAY. SHOOTING'S GOING TO START AS SOON AS TUB GETS THE SIGNAL. WHAT ARE THEY SHOOTING AT? ONE OF MARADY'S MEN. HE'S HOLED UP IN THE CANTINA. HE WAS POSING AS A SHOTGUN GUARD, AND ALL THE TIME HE WAS ONE OF THEM ROAD AGENTS THAT SHOT UP THE STAGECOACH THIS MORNING. WHAT'S HIS NAME? LARRY DeLONG, AND WE'RE SURE GOING TO GET HIM, SO YOU'D BETTER KEEP OUT OF THE WAY. ALL RIGHT, WHAT HAPPENED? I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T FIGURE IT. YOU FOOL. I TOLD YOU TO KILL HIM. I WANTED TO GIVE HIM HIS OWN MEDICINE. WE HAD HIM HOG-TIED AND LEFT HIM IN THE SUN TO ROT. YOU STUPID FOOL. YOU AND YOUR REVENGE MAY HAVE RUINED THIS JOB FOR US. I'LL GET HIM THIS TIME. YOU'LL GET NOBODY. NOW LOOK, WE'RE GOING ON TO THE CLUB, ANYWAY. IF THEY KEEP BUSY WITH DeLONG, WE STILL GOT A CHANCE. NOW COME ON. IT'S BUCK'S JOB TO HANDLE THIS. YOU KNOW THAT, TOM. BUCK ISN'T HERE, TUB. [ GUNSHOT ] WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE IS HAPPENING? MAYBE THEY RAN INTO TROUBLE. THEY MAY NEED HELP. LET'S GO. I'M NOT RIDING INTO A TOWN WHERE THEY'RE WAITING TO SHOOT AT ME. LET'S YOU AND I RIDE IN AND FIND OUT. THE REST OF YOU WAIT HERE. YOU'RE LETTING A TERRIBLE THING HAPPEN. YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH MEN HERE TO HELP YOU BREAK UP THAT CROWD. WE'VE BEEN ALL OVER THAT, ORISSA, NOW PLEASE -- YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU BELIEVE IN LAW AND ORDER. FORGET THAT I LOVE LARRY. FORGET EVERYTHING ELSE EXCEPT WHAT'S HAPPENING. IF LARRY IS GUILTY, LET A COURT DECIDE IT, BUT DON'T LET THAT LYNCH-CRAZED MOB OUT THERE DESTROY HIM AND EVERYTHING ELSE WE BELIEVE IN. YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. YOU CAN STOP IT. I INTEND TO. EDDIE, PLEASE TAKE OVER. COME ON. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? HOW DO YOU DO, GENTLEMEN? I'LL TAKE BACK OVER NOW, EDDIE. YES, SIR. HOPE YOU GENTLEMEN WILL FORGIVE THE INTERRUPTION. SMALL FAMILY MATTER. WE ALL HAVE THEM, COLONEL. THEY SHOULD BE HERE BY NOW. YOU STAY HERE. GIVE ME A SLAB OF THAT PIE AND A CUP OF COFFEE. YOU SURE GOT A COOL NERVE, SHERIFF -- EATING WITH ALL THAT GOING ON. I DIDN'T HAVE MY DESSERT. YOU GOT A NERVE JUST THE SAME. I GOT A STOMACH, TOO. WHAT DO YOU THINK, TOM? I DON'T KNOW. THINK HE'S HIT? SOME OF THESE GUN TOTERS GOT NINE LIVES. I DON'T KNOW. WHAT HAPPENED? WHERE'S THE REST OF THE OUTFIT? WHAT HAPPENED? WE HEARD SHOOTING. THE REST STAYED OUT. WE COME IN TO SEE WHAT'S UP. THEY GOT DeLONG PINNED DOWN IN THE CANTINA. THEY THINK HE'S ONE OF OUR BUNCH. DeLONG -- HE GOT AWAY? I TOLD PINTO TO LET ME PLUG HIM. I CAN STILL DO IT. NO, FORGET HIM. THIS MESS CAN MAYBE WORK BETTER FOR US THAN WE PLANNED. GO GET THE OTHERS, AND GET THEM IN HERE FAST. YOU COME WITH ME. [ GUNSHOTS ] Larry: THE THICK ADOBE WALLS PROTECTED ME, AND I STILL WAS RELUCTANT TO SHOOT BACK, BUT THAT LIGHTED CANDLE MADE THE CANTINA AN EASY TARGET, AND I BLASTED IT. Larry: THEY WEREN'T SO BRAVE NOW THAT THEY THOUGHT I WAS RETURNING THEIR FIRE. WAS THAT DeLONG? NOT SURE. WAS ANYBODY HURT? I DON'T KNOW, HEARD THE SHOT. HE SURE TOOK A CRACK AT SOMETHING. ALL RIGHT, HENRY? ALL RIGHT HERE, MR. WALLACE! LEWELLYN! YOU BOYS ALL RIGHT? YEAH! WHAT'S HAPPENED? WHERE'S TUB? HE'S ON HIS WAY TO LUNCHROOM LAST TIME I SEEN HIM. COME ON, WE'LL GET HIM. I DON'T SEE PINTO NO PLACE. I TOLD HIM TO WAIT HERE. YOU WANT ME TO SEE IF I CAN FIND HIM? NO, DON'T BOTHER WITH IT. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THEY CAN HANG THAT REVENGEFUL FOOL WITH DeLONG. MAKE YOURSELF LIKE A CUSTOMER. DON'T YOU EVER STOP EATING? ANOTHER KILLING AND STILL YOU'VE GOT TO GO ON FEEDING YOUR FACE. OF ALL THE MISERABLE, YELLOW-BELLIED, DISGUSTING REPRESENTATIVES OF LAW I'VE EVER SEEN. NOW, DON'T YOU GO GETTING OUT OF HAND AGAIN, MR. WALTERS. DeLONG JUST SHOT SOMEBODY. WHO? WE DON'T KNOW YET. IF I WAS DeLONG, I'D COME OUT AND GIVE MYSELF UP. YEAH, AND GET YOURSELF HANGED. YOU GOT AN IDEA THERE, MISS. SHE AIN'T ALONE. DeLONG? DeLONG? CAN YOU HEAR ME? LARRY, LISTEN TO ME. THIS IS CRAZY. THIS WON'T GET YOU ANYTHING. KEEP YOUR GUN. COME ON OUT WITH IT. I AIN'T GOT NOTHING AGAINST YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'VE GOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH MARADY'S GANG OR NOT, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT HERE THAT THINK THAT THEY KNOW, AND I CAN'T HOLD THEM OFF ALL NIGHT. LARRY, BUCK TOLD ME TO LOCK YOU UP UNTIL HE GOT BACK. THAT'S MY ORDERS. THAT'S WHAT I GOT TO DO. LARRY, JAIL IS THE BEST PLACE FOR YOU. YOU GOT TO SEE THAT. YOU'LL BE MUCH SAFER THERE. I PROMISE YOU. I'LL MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU. YOU COME ON OUT, AND IF ANYBODY STARTS ANYTHING, WE'LL STAND THEM OFF TOGETHER. I'LL STAY RIGHT WITH YOU UNTIL BUCK GETS BACK WITH THE POSSE. THAT WHINING TUB OF LARD. SOMEBODY OUGHT TO RIP THAT BADGE RIGHT OFF OF HIM. YEAH, THAT SHERIFF'S A REAL BRAVE MAN, ALL RIGHT. THAT MAKES ME SICK. THE WHOLE THING MAKES ME SICK. SOMETHING OUGHT TO BE DONE. AIN'T YOU THE LAW, OR AIN'T YOU? AW, DON'T BE A FOOL, LARRY. I'M DOING ALL I CAN DO, BUT I CAN'T TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS BUNCH ALL THE TIME. Larry: TUB MEANT WELL, BUT WITH ALL HOPE GONE NOW OF OVERTAKING THE SHERIFF AND BRINGING THE POSSE BACK TO TOWN, I HAD TO REMAIN FREE TO GET MARADY, SINGLE-HANDED, IF NECESSARY. STICK AROUND, HANDSOME. IT'S DISGRACEFUL THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED ON THE STREETS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE WAITING FOR. WHY DON'T THEY HANG HIM? THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. THEY SHOULD HANG HIM AND GET IT OVER WITH. WHAT DO YOU MEAN OFFERING THAT KILLER A DEAL LIKE THAT? IT MIGHT'VE WORKED. WE'D HAVE NAILED HIM THE MINUTE HE STEPPED OUTSIDE THAT DOOR. WAIT A MINUTE. IF I'D MADE THAT DEAL, I WOULD'VE STUCK WITH IT. ALL RIGHT, SO YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT. DID YOU SEE HIM? DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING EITHER. MAYBE HE ISN'T IN THERE. MAYBE HE'S GONE. WHERE, UP THE CHIMNEY? THAT SHOT. SUPPOSE HE KILLED HIMSELF. HE'S DEAD, THEN. IF HE WASN'T HE'D HAVE WEANED YOU THE MINUTE YOU WALKED IN RANGE. SOMEBODY'S GOING TO HAVE TO FIND OUT IF HE'S DEAD OR ALIVE. WELL, GO AHEAD. THAT'S YOUR JOB. LOOK, MR. WALTERS, I TOOK AN OATH WHEN I WAS SWORN IN THIS OFFICE, AND IT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. THE LONGER LARRY DeLONG STAYS IN THERE, THE BETTER I LIKE IT. TALK ABOUT YOUR TIN BADGES. THAT SHERIFF HAS SWEAT IN HIS BOOTS. I NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT IN MY WHOLE LIFE. SOMEBODY OUGHT TO BE MAN ENOUGH TO SET THAT BAG OF BEANS ON HIS FEET. WHAT'S ALL THE TOMFOOLERY ABOUT? THE WHOLE TOWN'S STANDING ON ITS EARS. YOU'RE MAKING A 6-HORSE TEAM OUT OF ONE LITTLE OLD SADDLE PONY, ALL OF YOU. LARRY DeLONG'S JUST A SHOTGUN GUARD, SAME AS ME WHEN I WAS RIDING STAGE. SURE, HE'S GOOD WITH A GUN, BUT HE AIN'T NO WILD BILL HICKOCK OR WES HARDEN, IF HE'S ALIVE. IF HE'S DEAD, HE'S JUST A PLAIN, ORDINARY CORPSE. YOU'RE MAKING FOOLS OUT OF THE WHOLE BLAME TOWN. YOU GOT A BIG MOUTH, BEN. ONE OF THESE DAYS SOMEBODY'S APT TO PUT THEIR FOOT IN IT. THE MAN'S TALKING HORSE SENSE. ENOUGH HORSE SENSE TO KNOW THAT IF YOU WANT DeLONG, YOU GOT TO GO IN THERE AND GET HIM. MAYBE YOU KNOW A GOOD WAY. IS THERE TWO WAYS TO GET ON A HORSE? THROW ONE LEG OVER THE SADDLE, AND YOU'RE UP ON THE MEANEST BRONC ALIVE. LARRY DeLONG'S JUST ONE MAN. WHAT DO YOU GET STANDING OUT HERE TALKING TO YOURSELVES? IF HE'S ALIVE, MARCH HIM OUT. IF HE'S DEAD, DRAG HIM OUT. Larry: THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS BROUGHT ME TO THE DOOR, BUT IT WASN'T ONLY BEN I SAW. I SPOTTED PINTO, AND THAT COULD ONLY MEAN ONE THING -- MARADY WAS ALREADY IN TOWN. I HAD TO GET OUT NOW AND FAST. ANYBODY TRY THAT AGAIN, AND HE PICK HIM OFF LIKE SWATTING A FLY. HE DIDN'T PICK HIM OFF. HE JUST DISARMED HIM. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO STOP DEFENDING DeLONG? HOW MANY MEN DOES HE HAVE TO KILL BEFORE YOU DO SOMETHING? THERE'S THE ONLY MAN IN THIS TOWN WITH ANY SENSE. NOW YOU'RE TALKING. PITCH IT UP THERE. THIS HAS GOT TO BE DONE RIGHT, MEN. NO ROPE. I TOLD YOU -- NO ROPE. JACK, GET AROUND BACK. TELL LEWELLYN TO GET SET. WE'RE GOING TO RUSH BOTH DOORS. TUB, YOU BETTER LOCK YOURSELF IN THE OFFICE UNTIL IT'S OVER. TOM, LISTEN TO ME. YOU'RE ALL GOING CRAZY. LET GO OF ME! TOM! THERE'S WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THIS TOWN. DO YOU WANT YOUR OWN WIFE AND DAUGHTER TO SEE THIS AND REMEMBER IT? LET GO OF ME, YOU FOOL! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? GET OFF THE STREETS AND GO HOME. DID YOU HEAR ME? GET OFF THE STREET AND GO HOME AND STAY THERE. COME ON, HURRY UP. WE'VE GOT TO GET EVERYBODY ORGANIZED. THEY'D FINALLY DECIDED TO RUSH THE CANTINA AND BURN ME OUT, IF NECESSARY. BUT I HAD BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. HOLD IT! IF YOU'RE SO DEAD-SET ON SOMEBODY GETTING KILLED, I RECKON IT MIGHT AS WELL BE ME. I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S GETTING PAID FOR IT. LARRY? NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME. I'M COMING IN. NO GUN IN MY HAND. BUT I'M COMING IN TO GET YOU IF YOU'RE STILL ON YOUR FEET. NOW DON'T BE HASTY. THINK IT OVER GOOD. THINK IT OVER REAL GOOD WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO WHEN I COME THROUGH THIS DOOR. Larry: NOTHING COULD STOP ME NOW AS I HEADED FOR THE BANK CLUB AND THE SHOWDOWN WITH MARADY. HE AIN'T HERE. HE'S GONE! I THOUGHT YOU SAID THE BACK DOOR WAS COVERED. IT IS. THERE ARE FOUR MEN BACK THERE. HE MUST'VE GOT OUT OF HERE SOMEHOW. [ WEEPING ] OH, NO. WHERE IS HE? WE DON'T KNOW. HA HA HA! HA HA HA! Larry: MARADY'S GANG WAS INSIDE THE CLUB. I HAD TO HAMSTRING THEM SOMEHOW TO STOP THEIR GETAWAY. TUB, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND -- [ GUNSHOT ] THE BANK CLUB. COME ON, MEN! AND TRY USING YOUR HEAD FOR A CHANGE. [ GUNSHOTS ] GET OUT OF HERE! [ GUNSHOTS ] FOUR. FIVE. MARADY FIGURED TO GET ME BEFORE I HAD TIME TO RELOAD, BUT HE MADE ONE MISTAKE. HE DIDN'T FIGURE HIS GOOD LUCK PIECE HAD CHANGED HANDS. ANY BUSINESS IN THERE FOR ME? IT AIN'T LIKELY, DOC. LARRY. THANKS, JOHNNY. I OWED YOU THAT, SIR. DO YOU SUPPOSE YOUR COOK HAS ENOUGH CHOW IN THE KITCHEN TO TAKE CARE OF A LITTLE COMPANY? WE'D CONSIDER IT AN HONOR, SIR. COLONEL, TELL THE COOK TO MAKE IT TWO EXTRA PLACES.
