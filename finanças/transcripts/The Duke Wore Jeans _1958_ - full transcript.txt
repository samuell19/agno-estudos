(gentle music) (bright music) (dramatic music) (bright music) [Duchess] Hello, darling. Hello, my boy. Eh, it's good to be back. (dramatic music) Well, it's grand to be home. Grand. I don't want to sound too depressing, father, but this may not be our home much longer. If I can't sell any of our cattle abroad, we're really in trouble. Don't worry, darling. Everything's arranged. Isn't it, Edward? It certainly is. When do I leave for Ritalla? Tomorrow if you like. You'll have a wonderful time just as we've had. It's a beautiful country. Everything about the place is beautiful. Eh, my dear? Except their cattle I hope. May I see those photographs, father? Right you are. Come here, my boy. Take a look at these. Well, sit yourself down, Tony. Well then, look. Modern place, eh? Fresh as paint. And all because of oil. Ritalla struck oil a few years ago and every barrel earns a royalty in fresh crinkly dollars for the king. Charming, man. [Tony] Yes, I know about that, father. Charming palace. Newly built. That's where you'll stay as guest of their majesty. And their daughter, the Princess Maria. Charming. The cattle, father? Yes. Here you are. If this is a fair example of Ritallan cattle, the country's going to need our Whitecliffe thoroughbreds. Go on. Pretty girl. Ain't she beautiful? Father, the king needs good cattle. We can supply it. But if he wants a further supply of princesses, no one can help him but himself. I fail to see why you take pictures of a. Ah, that's better. Mm, bad grazing. Unscientific breeding. The signs are all here. Now if you can show me some more. Really father, how can I hope to study the sales possibilities of these cattle when all you show me is this girl? Let's face it. He only has eyes for cows. You talk to him, Cynthia. Oh no, Edward, you. Whew. [Cynthia] Well, Edward. Well, it's arranged, but I never felt more ashamed in all my life putting pressuring on Tony to barter himself. What else could we do? Poor boy. Perhaps you ought to speak to him again just to make sure. No time. It's late now. I must telephone the airline people to make sure of his ticket. Why not send Cooper with him? Yes. Yes I think perhaps we should. To buy a ticket for Cooper as well, I shall have to pawn the blessed car.

Sounds like a worse scrape than usual. Worse? It's a disaster. Surely not, Master Tony. My father has arranged for me to marry the Princess Maria of Ritalla. There, how 'bout that? But you can't and you must tell him why you can't. Is that all you can suggest? Come on, Cooper. You can do better than that. I'm sorry, sir. There is no alternative. There must be.

Well that's what they said in the village. The village? Yeah, I'm looking for a couple days work. Work? A couple of day's work? You know the type that brings in the money. [Tony] Money? Yeah, window cleaning, cleaning out your cowshed, weeding. Any. (cows mooing) Have I seen you somewhere before? You know you don't half remind me of someone. Do I? Who could it be? Blimey, it's me. That's right. Well we'd better get to know each other then. My name's Tommy Hudson. You can call me Tommy. You can call me Tony for the moment and this is Cooper. Hi. What are you doing here? Well I'm hitching around the country. You know, looking at life before I decide to have a go myself. An enterprising sort of chap, eh? Most adventurous. Oh, it's a laugh you know, but at the moment I'm looking for a couple day's work. Nothing permanent, mind you. Any chance here? There's every chance. (cows mooing) Just what the Whitecliffe's need. An enterprising adventurous sort of chap. What kind of a job is it? It's a pushover. A dream. Hm? How would you like to go to Ritalla? The Cadillac Kingdom. [Tony] Blazing sun all day. Balmy nights. Balmy. First class plane tickets. You stay in the palace. [Tony] Guests of the king and queen. Marry a princess. Wear a crown in bed I suppose. No, that's just what you mustn't do. Well, what do you think? I think you're harmless, but I know you're cracked. Give my regards to Napoleon, will ya. Tada. (dramatic music) Get out. Let go. Now, Tommy. Mr. Hudson, listen. Now listen, I'm the honourable Tony Whitecliffe. Yeah and I'm Oliver Cromwell. Get out of it. Listen. All right, I'm listening. I am Tony Whitecliffe. Yeah, course you are, mate. My father wants me to marry the Princess of Ritalla. Well, is that good or bad? Bad. Master Tony is already married. [Tony] To a girl. Well that's normal anyway. I mean an ordinary girl. She has no title. Our marriage is secret. My parents would never have agreed to me marrying a girl without a title. You couldn't just tell 'em I suppose, could you? The only way out is for you to go to Ritalla in my place and pretend you're me. Give you a bit of a breather. You've got it. Course I've got it. I'm not daft, but I know who is. Get out of it. (cows mooing) (gentle music) Blimey, it's him. It is true after all. Then you'll go? Well if it'll help you out, I'll have a try. Sir, before any final decision is taken, may I strongly advise a test. Anything. Your mother. Oh. Cooper. Sir? Take me to mama. Her grace usually takes tea at this hour. An excellent opportunity. We just have time. Good luck, Tommy. Come on, Coop. (gentle music) (man whistling) I mean, goodness gracious. (gentle music) Master Tony's watch and ring, sir. (gentle music) That'll be all, Coop. It is not all, sir. I must help you dress. Eh? It's customary, sir. Look, I'll do me own buttons up if you don't mind. That's customary where we come from. Hey, Coop. Sir? I kind of forgot to have something for dinner. Any chance of working in some grub in on the tea? Certainly, sir. Thank you, Cooper. You know I never eat anything at this time of day. Master Tony especially requested some grub, your grace. Grub? I beg your pardon, your grace. Food, I lapses linguae. Hello again, mater. Oh Tony, darling. You haven't called me that since you left school. Well I'm as happy as a schoolboy and just as hungry. [Cynthia] Happy? Why certainly, mater old thing. Wonderful weather, spiffing sunshine. Jolly hot crumpets. You may go, Cooper. Your grace. What's the mater matter? Matter mater? You. Well, I'd better go then. Can I have a crumpet please? Don't be so absurd. Relax. Darling, are you pretending this for my sake? What, what? Pretending to be happy? [Tommy] But I am happy. You mean about going to Ritalla and you know? [Tommy] Of course. I'm so relieved. Your father's arranging about airline tickets for you and Cooper. Cooper's going with you. Won't that be nice? Delightful. There's just one thing that puzzles me. We were under the impression that you were against the whole thing. What made you change your mind? Well just recently I've become a new man. I've taken a look at myself and I see where my duty lies. Family tradition, old school tie and all that rot. You know Tony, this doesn't sound at all like you. You can say that again. There's just one last thing I'd like to ask. Of course, darling. What is it? Can I have a crumpet please? (bright music) (hand knocking) Come in. How'd it go? It worked. Ah, you leave tomorrow? Yeah with Cooper. Oh, that's wonderful. I'll go away with the wife for a while. Perfect switch, eh? Excellent. Hey. What's the matter? Why the long face? Well, it's your mum. She was a nice lady. She didn't strike me as what you said she was, a snob. That's nice of you, but I think I know my own folk best. Yeah, suppose so. Now look old chap, for a while you've got to get used to the idea of being an aristocrat. It isn't all champagne and oysters. Take it from me. Well, I'll need a few more tips then.

At 3:30 precisely we will land and transfer to a plane of the king's flight in which we will continue the journey to Ritalla Airport. I suggest you use the time to study. [Tommy] I'll look like a cow by the time I get there. Start reading. Keep your mind on cattle and off the princess. Look, you haven't even shown me a picture of her yet. Besides, I'm not going to get any ideas anyway. All right? She won't even notice me, mate. I bet she's never met an ordinary bloke before since the day she was born. Princess. (gentle music) (phone ringing) (gentle music) Lady Marguerita, if you speak on that telephone, I'll never speak to you again. Well? It's ringing. $80,000 for a palace telephone system and I can't even get through to me own daughter. But your highness you know who it is. I also know what I'm doing. We know she's in. We also know she's not answering, don't we? What are we to do? Whitecliffe will be landing in a few minutes. This time Maria's really gone too far. She'll either obey my royal command or she'll get a royal smacked bottom. She's not too old for that yet. (gentle music) Now you listen to me, my girl. Oh my poor, darling. Whatever's the matter? What's happened? I've developed a sudden severe and infectious chill. And is that your diagnosis, doctor? Your majesty, the case is of exceptional interest. Indeed. There are no physical symptoms. I'm inclined to the view that this ailment is of deep psychiatric origin. Deep psychiatric lead swinging. [Doctor] Oh your majesty, if you will allow me to elaborate. I will allow you to leave us. Your majesty. Maria, you will get out of this bed and down to the airport or I shall give you such a smacking you won't be able to sit down at your coronation. Darling, how can you be so harsh? How can you be so gullible? You never suffered from a diplomatic illness? If you've got a chill, I've got housemaid's knee. I refuse to be married off to any... How many times must I tell you that if you don't marry some noble or other within the next six months, I shall have to abdicate. No, you won't. The girl's mad. She has absolutely no idea. Oh, I have plenty of ideas and an arranged marriage isn't one of them. You stubborn little... Maria, give it a chance. Meet him. You may like him. Like him, mother? Some chinless chump from the land of fog. Here, look. Here is a photograph. A photograph which you have stubbornly refused even to look at. And I refuse now. But here is definite documentary proof of the chin. Why dammit his family goes back to William the Conqueror. And it can stay there. Lady Marguerita, will you kindly hand me a smooth backed hairbrush? We have to get to the airport, dear. What? So we have. Lucky for you. (bright music) (phone ringing) (gentle music) The Princess Maria's apartment. Please wait a moment. It's the Prime Minister, Mr. Bastini. He craves an audience. Well tell him to stop craving and come on round. The audience is granted. Immediately Mr. Prime Minister. Your highness. How many times must I tell you I know what I'm doing? (gentle music) Your highness. Your highness, my congratulations. The chill. A master stroke. That is the only reason why I sought this audience your highness to express my admiration. Oh no, don't go. There's still something I don't quite understand. Highness. You want to abolish this old rule that the successor to the throne must marry before the age of 21. My dearest ambition and with your gracious help. Yes, that's just it. Why my help? Why can't you just do it? Why do we have to go through all this? What charming youthful innocence (laughs). My dear princess, in politics one must be dramatic. One must find a symbol for the people to rally round. You are that symbol. When it is revealed that you refused an arranged marriage, the absurdity of the law will be personalised. It's repeal will become popular, non controversial, and forever linked with your name. And no longer will an archaic time limit... Yes, yes, you can save your speech for parliament. Can't I tell my father? He's so worried. A surprise. Let it be a surprise. So much more pleasant, don't you think? I always think that depends so much on the kind of surprise. Don't you, Mr. Bastini? Just think, I shall be able to marry who I like when I like. Take your time, princess. Now there is no hurry. Thank you, Bastini. Highness. Please, may I be allowed to speak to you absolutely freely, your highness? Not if you have anything to say against that magnificent and progressive patriot. Progressive. Fiddle faddle. He's ambitious and crafty and you put yourself in his hands. You could be making a terrible mistake, Maria. The only thing I'm making is history. (engine revving) Hey Coop, there's an army down there. Who they waiting for? You. Cool. (bright music) Well, 'ere we go. Here we go. That's what I said. You didn't. Watch those H's. Hokay. Please, these people have met the Duke and Duchess. You're supposed to be their son, remember? You're supposed to be honourable. Look, the only way we're going to get away with this is by me being myself. Sh. (soft music) Welcome to Ritalla. Nice to be here, your majesty. Oh. Kiss. The hand. I trust you had a pleasant journey? Fab. I mean fab, your majesty. Oh, this is Cooper. He's my. Aide de camp. He's got all the patter off pat. Perhaps you'd care to inspect the guard of honour? Sure. Oh, on second thought, your majesty, if you don't mind me saying so. Looks like they'd like the rest of the day off. How very thoughtful of you. See to that, will you General? You will ride with General Bartolomeo, Mr. Cooper. Of course, your majesty. See you later, Coop. (bright music) I met a number of your nobles on my visit to England. Your master seems refreshingly different from most of them. The aristocracy has been democratised, General. From what I saw of him, I'd say revolutionised. You are too kind, General. I hope we enjoy our trip to Ritalla as much as you enjoyed your visit to England. I found your country very instructive. As a matter of fact, I took a course at Sandhurst and of course our army is modelled on yours. Oh, so this isn't the first time bull has been imported from England (chuckles)? That paraphernalia down at the airport, your majesty. Does that mean your people know about, you know, your daughter and me? Oh, no, no. The romance must appear to develop naturally. If my dear Maria had been at the airport to meet you... They would have caught on, eh. Crafty. You may rest assured to the people at the moment you mean one thing only. Cheap meat. Eh? Oh, the cattle deal. Yes, yes. Precisely. Our country is rich in oil but poor in livestock. However, an infusion of the Whitecliffe stock will alter all that in a few years. it won't take a few years (laughs). (gentle music) Your dress, sir. I got to wear this lot? Protocol. What's that, disinfectant? Get them on. You're due at the official reception. But they just met me. Now you have to be received formally at court in the throne room. Will I see the princess? Tommy. I know, I know. Don't get so excited. I only wondered what she looks like. This time you'll have to help me dress. (bright music) What do they want to give me this thing for? I'm not going to kill anybody. Come on. I am Bastini, Prime Minister and Minister of War. Do you wanna buy a sword, mate? Greetings, greetings, greetings. Hear ye a proclamation of greeting in the court of Ritalla in the presence of their majesties the King and Queen. Is the Princess in there? Her highness has a chill, sir. She is susceptible to them. She cannot stand anything cold. Or anything from a cold climate. Well he's a right, Bastini, for a start. And I charge you now to receive the aforementioned honourable Anthony Saint John Normandy Agincourt Stephen De Fawcett De Lisle Robinson Purley Gascoyne Whitecliffe. Blimey, it's a football team. It's you, sir. (bright music) Blimey. Look, do you mind if I lose this? I'm gonna do myself an injury. By all means. Ta. Ta. We bid you welcome to our kingdom and our home. Anthony heir to Whitecliffes. Thank you. I, Anthony Saint John Normandie. Do you really wanna hear all this? Looks kind of dry to me, mate. I've been waiting all my life to hear someone say that. You're really welcome. And it's really very nice to be here, your majesty. Oh, is there anything in your book where it says I can't express myself in me own way? Not a thing. But your majesty... If you don't mind, son, I need plenty of room for this. Unaccustomed as I am to making speeches, they couldn't have found a tighter pair of breeches.

With great respect your royal and very young and extremely stubborn highness, it's you who is talking nonsense. I tell you I don't care if I never see him again as long as I live. The Honourable Anthony Whitecliffe arrived at Ritalla Airport this morning. While he is in this country, Mr. Whitecliffe will be shown our oilfields and other industries. The young British nobleman is here on an official visit as the guest of their majesties to discuss livestock problems. It is hoped that Whitecliffe pedigree cattle will improve our own. (bright music) I've never been rushed about so much in all me life. What's the idea? You're a VIP. You're to be shown everything. Except the Princess. I wish her highness no harm, but personally I'm pleased she has a chill. It saves us a lot of trouble. Yeah, I suppose it does really. Just think. A couple of days ago I was trying to get lifts in cars like this. (bright music) Hey Coop, look at that. (bright music) Master Tony would be horrified and nor do I approve of your dressing yourself up like a Spanish bullfighter. Think of where we're going next. I only thought it might please them. Haven't you had enough? No, it's fun. What does your guidebook say? A Ritallan industry famous through many generations for the manufacture and export of. (gentle music) We would be honoured Honourable Anthony if you would accept this modern example of our ancient craft as a memento of your visit to our place of work. Thank you.

I assure you, Mr. Prime Minister, I haven't the slightest interest concerning this Whitecliffe person. Nevertheless, to set your mind completely at rest to strengthen your resolution, accept my considered judgement that you would not be in the least attracted to him. I accept your judgement as always. Highness. However, interested parties of the old school may approach you with false and enthusiastic reports concerning him. I shall ignore them all. Madam. Well, what do you think of that? You're listening to everything but your heart my dear silly Maria. You go too far. Sometimes a lady in waiting gets tired of waiting for her mistress to show some commonsense. Go away. (dramatic music) General, we have nothing to fear. She hasn't any interest even curiosity in Whitecliffe. (dramatic music) Then tomorrow? At the cabinet meeting. We confront the king with the facts. He abdicates. I declare a national emergency. I declare a martial law. And by nightfall a republic exists. A military. Dictatorship. For the time being. And the little princess goes down in history. But not the way she thinks. Maria the dupe. You have a politician's turn of phrase. You have a general's sense of strategy. We are partners. Partners. [Both] Partners. (dramatic music) He's back. Yes, he'll be back in England before you can say republic. He'll get tired of waiting suspicious of Maria's chill and that will be that. We must keep him busy. But he's seen everything. We just have to admit defeat. Not quite. At least we can keep him entertained tonight. How in heaven's name? The staff dance. Oh yes. Yes, I'd forgotten that. It'll amuse him. Be amongst people of his own age. He'll probably fall madly in love with a laundry maid and that will crown it. Oh. Oh, I know my dear it's a vulgar expression, but if a King can't use it, I'd like to know who can. Get me Mr. Whitecliffe. Excuse me. (gentle music) Who is it? [Marguerita] Lady Marguerita, your highness. Oh, come in. Oh forgive me. I was all confused and very unhappy. And I was much too hasty, my dear. I of all people should know that being a princess isn't the easiest task in the world. You do understand, don't you? Of course. You mustn't give into your feelings. It's your clear destiny to sacrifice your own chance of happiness for posterity. I shall probably never marry like the First Elizabeth of England. A great figure in history. A virgin queen. How wonderful for history. If a little dull for you. Now if I may a little advice. Please. Relax from your destiny awhile. Have fun. Go to the staff dance. Their majesties will only stay for the first dance and I can see to it for a few hours nobody calls you Maria there much less highness or princess. You can simply be a young girl at a dance like any other. Really relax from the problem of being a princess. It might do me good. I know it would do you a lot of good. Shall I help you to dress? No, thanks. You may go. We've both had quite a day. Here's to quite a night. (gentle music) (audience clapping) I think, my dear, our duty now consists in leaving the young people to enjoy themselves in contemporary rhythm. I quite agree. Goodnight, Mr. Whitecliffe. Goodnight. (upbeat music) (bright music) Sir, we are very pleased to have you with us. Thank you. I have heard of your unique presentation at court and of your visit to the guitar factory. I assure you, sir, it would please us greatly if you did in your tongue a hat trick and sang for us. Really? Yes. Delighted. This way, sir. Can I have a guitar, please? Thank you.

Ah, ah. (gentle music) Rather pleasant. (gentle music) Very palatable. Thank you. (gentle music) Oh, I beg your pardon. Oh, sorry, it's my fault. I shouldn't be wandering around. Should be dancing. So should you. How 'bout it? I'd be charmed. (gentle music) Barman, my dear friend. Dear friend. What is the name of this beneficial distillation? Brandka, sir.

Yes, I'm a cook. Really? What's your favourite dish? I haven't any. I just like cooking things up. What's cooking? You'd be surprised. (gentle music) Hey, what's up? Just remembered something on the boil. Must fly. Forgive me. Have fun. (gentle music) Would you like to dance? Thank you. (gentle music) (audience clapping) (gentle music) Do you come here often? That's what I should ask you. Well I work here, but I've never seen you around. No, I'm on a visit. Oh, anything to do with this Englishman Whitecliffe? Well, I work for him sort of. That sounds mysterious. Is your work secret? Well it is, but I'm not very good at keeping secrets. What do you mean? Believe it or not that sort of depends on how well we dance together. (gentle music) What's your name? Maria. Same as the princess. Oh, there's a quarter of a million Marias in this country all about the same age as the princess. What do you call yourself? Tommy Hudson. You don't look like a Tommy Hudson somehow. I seem to have seen you somewhere before. I must have a double. How confusing for you. Not if I know who I am or how I feel. Do you right now for sure? Sure I do. I'm leaving. You just got here. This is a horrible dance. Not what I expected at all. Leave me alone. Have I said something? You said nothing. Well what do you want me to say? I like you. I like to be with you. We've only just met. You've never seen me before. So? Look, if you don't like me okay. That's that but say so. I don't want to. Well what do you want to say? Well let's meet again in a couple of hours in the grounds by the trees. Yeah but... You go back to the dance. But I want to be with you. In a couple of hours when we've both had time to think. Time to think, eh? That's right. Well think about this. (gentle music) Hey Coop. Come and have a drink. Don't want a drink. I'm in enough trouble already. I wanna talk to you. Trouble? Nobody's in trouble. There's no such thing as trouble. The word has been abolished and all for the best happiness. The best of all possible worlds. Will you listen? Beautiful music. Look, I need your help, your advice. Advice? Advice? My advice to you is to have a brandka. My advice to everybody is to have a brandka. Cures all ills. Washes whitest. Not a stain in sight. Renews the bloodstream. Creates friendship. Brandka is the drink that thirst was invented for. Coop listen, Maria. A girl called Maria. That's it. Princess. Got a chill. We've got to cure her. Brandka. Got to pump the princess full of brandka. Worth a guinea a glass. I can't believe it. There must be a good reason. Oh, there is. Can't you see? He found out I wanted nothing to do with him and this cheap trick at the dance is to make me think he loves me for myself, whether I'm a princess or not. Oh, it makes me sick. He's just a crude fortune hunting philanderer and worse he must think I'm an absolute fool to fall for a cheap swindle like that. Just a minute. Did you know he was going to be at the dance? Yes, my dear, of course. I was trying to help. You did. Thank you. Without that knowledge, I might have spent the rest of my life pining for somebody absolutely cold blooded and worthless. Now, I never want to see him again. Never. But you arranged to meet him all the same. Why? I must give him this one chance just in case there is a good reason. ♪ Oh look it's all ♪ ♪ Happening ♪ ♪ It's all ♪ ♪ I heard 'em say they're giving it away for free ♪ Well have you had time to think? Have you? Of course. And now you can tell me the truth? Well that depends on... Well, that's not very encouraging. No, I know. I'm not much hand at these pretty speeches, but if you'll listen I'll have a go. I've told you before I like you. I like you a lot. And I got a feeling you don't exactly think I'm a dog either. Well if you do, say so. It'll save us both a lot of trouble. I'm sorry. I need just a little more time to work out exactly what I think. You don't understand. Ever since I met you, I've been in a muddle. I can't explain. If you'll only tell me how you feel about me, I could tell you how. I just got to know. You will at our next meeting. Blimey not another replay. What's blimey? It's an expression. Can't you tell me now, Maria? At our next meeting, Tommy Hudson. Wait. That's what you'll have to do until we meet again. Where, when? You'll find out, Tommy Hudson. (soft music) What happened? I went to a dance and I fell in love. No, please. This morning I am in no condition to. Did you say in love? 'Course I did. Why not? I can't allow it. She was beautiful and she was crazy, too, I think, but she was real beautiful. You're mad. Oh, it's impossible. I warned you. But you said not to fall for the princess. I haven't. It doesn't matter. It's a complication. It could be disastrous. You've got to stop it. I've got to find her. I've got to find her. Find her? Don't you know where she is? I don't even know who she is. I must be going mad. Oh that drink. That skull cracking brandka. Oh. Tommy. I beg you. I ask again, what happened? She was wonderful just like a dream, but this is like a nightmare. You'll have to tell the king who I am. I've made up my mind. Oh no. Sorry, Coop. You'll just have to cancel everything. Nothing matters but finding this girl. But you can't do that. Exposure, shame, ruin. Think of the Hon. Tony. I am thinking about him. I'm thinking about what he did to be with the girl that he wanted to be with. Fair's fair, mate. Let us be calm. Let us be quite calm. (phone ringing) Yes. Yes. No. Oh now? Oh yes. Oh dear. Oh. What's up, Coop? The princess. She's better. She wants to see you. The game's up then. I'll tell her. I bet she's no more interested in this fixed marriage lark than the Honourable Tony. Where do I meet her? The throne room. Bow your head. Don't look at her 'til she gives you permission. Protocol? You're catching on, son, but too late. Too late. (soft music) You may look on us. Mr. Hudson. Yes? Are you quite mad or do you think I am? How dare you keep up this fantastic pretence now? It's no pretence. Here let me get me bearings a minute. I've got my bearings, Mr. Whitecliffe. Me name's Tommy Hudson. You're a cheat and you've been found out. Cor blooming blimey. Me name's Tommy Hudson. You're the dishonourable Anthony Whitecliffe. Now get out and... Be quiet. Let me go. You're gonna listen. I'll call a guard. Call a regiment. You're gonna listen. My name is Tommy Hudson.

You'll have to stay as Tony a little while longer. Why? Five minutes before I leave for the cathedral to marry you then I'll tell everybody who you are. Why the marriage laws will be laughed out of existence. Complete victory. I don't know nothing about these affairs of state, but what I do know is that where I come from if a fellow wants to marry a girl, they go to her dad and lay it on the line. Come on, let's go and do it. No and that is my royal command. Oh. To disobey is treason. Here's my seal on it. Blimey. We must face the facts, your majesty. Everyone knows that the princess is feigning illness because she wants nothing to do with an arranged marriage. It's early days yet. Your majesty, the only dignified course of action is to spare that inoffensive young man needless embarrassment and terminate his visit as quickly and diplomatically as possible. Gentlemen, I have one suggestion to make. Please. This unhappy state of affairs arises from an archaic law. I suggest quite simply that we repeal the royal marriage and succession act giving the royal family the elementary right... Your majesty, this is a constitutional crisis. Tamper with the constitution, you aggravate the crisis. Can't you somehow amend the constitution? (dramatic music) Abdicate. (dramatic music) Gentlemen, the cabinet meeting is ended and so I think is the constitutional crisis. (dramatic music) This is where I used to play when I was a little girl. I used to sit here for hours daydreaming about when I grew up how I'd pass a law against loneliness. It would have been a wonderful law. It's passed for me. Come and sit down.

I have to speak to you alone, your highness. Okay. How you feeling now, Coop? What's on your mind, mate? Your highness, I must ask you what is the meaning of this? But it's simple. I'm going to be his trouble and strife. His what? Straight up I am. His trouble and... Strife. Wife. It's rhyming slang. The very smartest thing in British society. You are behind the times. Your highness, you're destroying our historic plan. [Maria] There's no need to get into a two and eight. Two and state? You're catching on China. (laughs) China? China? Oh, your highness. Oh, don't take on so Bassy boy. Everything's going to be all right. Just you go on up the apples and take a drop of the old how's your father and you'll feel better. Apples? How's my father? Princess, your highness, are you all right out here in the strong sun? Never felt better, but I would sort of like to be on my jack for awhile. Who is Jack? Oh, Bastini, if only you could see yourself. I can. I can. Only too tragically clearly. I see a man who has devoted his life to the service of the people standing on the threshold of his greatest social reform when suddenly from a most unexpected quarter, he is dealt a body blow. You owe it to posterity to deny your heart in this matter. I owe it to myself to marry the one I love, so wish me luck. I appeal to you, your highness, to remember our joint plans to repeal the marriage and succession law if you persist in sabotaging them by this romance. We'll still abolish that old rule. Don't worry. It'll be even more of a spectacular victory than we planned. Wait and see. You'll be surprised. All right. I place my trust in you. And I won't let you down, cock. But the consequences. Think of the consequences of this romance. I am thinking. Lovely. Tommy, don't you realise you're an imposter? Have you noticed the way her nose wrinkles? You'll be discovered, deported. Diplomatic complications. Stern notes between governments, oh. Her eyes are like great big bowls of treacle. This might mean war. We'll have our honeymoon in Margate. You promised me not to fall in love. Oh no, she's a princess. Must remember that. We'll go to Bournemouth. Tommy, for heaven's sake. You'll have to pretend to be ill, paralysed. No, a sudden attack of insanity. That's it. Yes, that's it. I'll call the palace doctor. Throw myself entirely at his mercy. Coop, something bothering you? Just this. You simply cannot marry this girl. Why not? You know very well why not. Now come to your senses. There is no solution for us except to leave at once. Oh, but there is. Listen a minute. (dramatic music) Magnificent. Simply magnificent. I think it'll do the trick. Sir, may I shake your hand? Help yourself. You may leave the detailed arrangements to me. I shall be proud to undertake them and I shall be with you at the triumphant end. Thank you, Cooper. How's this? Full dossier required urgently on Anthony Whitecliffe stop. Start your investigations immediately stop. I do not mean stop but start stop, Bastini. Excellent. I suspected him from the very beginning. You never mentioned it. It was I who took the hint from the princess and deduced the fantastic but all too possible explanation that he is an imposter. She said nothing of the kind. She only said that you might... That I would be surprised. Well it's Maria the independent who is likely to be surprised now. Bastini, supposing he's not an imposter at all? That would be unfortunate for him. An accident? That's your department. But whatever happens, this marriage must not take place. Look, I still don't like the idea of us springing it on 'em. Why don't we tell 'em now? Oh no, please don't. But they're going to send these photos all over the world and they're not of me. They are of me, but they're not of me. Don't you see what I mean? Don't look so worried. You'll spoil them all. Let's tell 'em now. Darling, I want my triumph complete. Wait for my sake. Oh all right then. Aren't you happy? After all, we are engaged to be married. Yeah, I know.

You've no idea what a weight it'll be off me mind to be able to... - Sh, sh, sh. The Duke and Duchess, your parents, have arrived on the plane. Oh good. Would you like to see the before the party, dear? Oh no, I don't think so. We don't want to keep the mob waiting, do we? Very well. Shall we go in? (crowd chattering) (bright music) My friends, it is inevitable that there should be a certain air of formality on this occasion, but I want to dispose with the formality as quickly as possible so that the warm and happy reason for our meeting together can be celebrated in the fullest sense of the word. So I address you now, not as a monarch, but as a father charged with one of the happiest duties that a father can be called upon to perform. It is to announce that a beloved daughter has chosen the man she will marry. Has found true love and happiness. Thus it will be my pleasure to bid you welcome into our midst our future son in law, but first as I warned you one final formality. Is there anyone among you who knows full and sufficient reason why Maria, Princess of Ritalla, should not herewith become betrothed to the Honourable Anthony Whitecliffe heir... Your majesty, I've something to tell you first. What? Is it this, you fraud? Your majesty, I have here a dispatch from our ambassador in London. Anthony Whitecliffe is already married. Why didn't the dear boy tell us? But then who? This man is at best an intending bigamist or at worst a downright imposter. Oh dear. Sh, I'll miss my cue. What are you getting so excited about? I was just going to tell everybody. Well he wanted to right from the beginning. I stopped him. Our princess has been bemused and our nation very nearly tricked by this common cockney. I'd rather be any kind of cockney than your kind of prime minister, mate. Listen everybody, we want to get married. There shouldn't be anything to stop us, but just in case there's anybody that feels that there should be something before a bloke's name. You tell 'em, Coop. Your majesties, your highness, Mr. Prime Minister, my Lords, ladies and gentlemen. May I present to you the one and only son of London's Pearly king and queen, Prince Tommy. (bright music) Here come and meet my mum and dad. Here meet my mum and dad. How do you do? Pleased to meet you. [King] Welcome to Ritalla. [Queen] How do you do? [Maria] Hello. [Pearly King] How do you do? Ah, Cooper. Your grace, madam. May I present Lady Marguerita. The Duke and Duchess of Whitecliffe. - How do you do? - How do you do? I'm pleased to inform you... Have you done a deal for the cattle? I have. A good one? Fab, your grace. Fab? (bright music) Your majesties. Your royal highness. My Lords, ladies and gentlemen.
