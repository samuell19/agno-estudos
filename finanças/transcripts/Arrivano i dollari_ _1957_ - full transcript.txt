This is any country in any region of Italy. Church, houses , streets, square, town hall. This is the country of the five meals. Don't worry about breakfasts, lunches and dinners ... ... Meals are the members of a strange family ... ... and in order of seniority they are called Giuseppe ... ... Cesaretto, Michelino, Alfonso and Piero. In the country, besides what we have shown you, there is little to see ... ... but the Pasti brothers are worth meeting ... ..especially now that five telegrams from South Africa ... ... they will shake them and show them to us with their defects and virtues. More defects than virtues, but who knows they won't improve over time ! Lent, the postman, is about to deliver the first telegram. The story of the five meals has begun. Mr. Piero! Hello, there is a telegram from abroad. - Good morning. - Good morning. Armandino! I go for a coffee, then step into the garage. If the gas suppliers come , swallow them.

Good luck. - Thanks. What did you tell me? .... 7, 8, 9 and 1 0. That's enough. Too much oil in the soup is bad for you. Well? What's up? It hurts you! Weren't you complaining of shoulder pain the other day ? It came because I had brought a demijohn of oil. - What am I saying? It was the oil that hurt you! - Yup... - You never listen to me! - Mr. Giuseppe! Who is this nuisance? Ah, it's you, Vince '! Salts! Salts! - All right! - But take off your shoes nails ruin the floor. Rosi '! There is Vincenzo. If I tell you to bring him the wine ... ... do as usual. - Yes. "It's over ..."

That smile seals our love. Then get married. This house was mine. All mine. But two of us were too many and you understood it. Ah, if you understood! I hit you here, remember? Then you proposed something that I didn't understand at the time. "Let's take a trip to the mountains!" "How in the mountains?" "In the mountains!"

Rather explain this paperwork to me! Tomorrow I have to be a real notary! And do you think that as a notary you will be able to discover their true soul? I don't know if with this stratagem I will discover their defects and virtues ... ..but sure I'll find out what they think of me. And who knows that he doesn't find relatives who love me a little bit? Let's hope. For example, the tall one has an honest face. - You want to talk about Piero, huh? The youngest. - Yeah. Okay, I'll entrust it to you. You'll take care of him. Yes, because you are young and you will understand it better than me. Mister count! Mister count! - Go away!

Not even from him or fall from the pan into the embers. - Aunt, this is my wife Clara. - Pleasure. - Pleasure. - You're not greeting me? - I did, but he got lost in their compliments. I am pleased to find you gathered in harmony. Shall we talk about my poor husband, your uncle? Peace be upon him! - He was my favorite uncle. - On purpose you helped him when he needed! When I arrived in South Africa many years ago, it had very hard beginnings. Then things got better, he made a good fortune and married me. - Then you're the one who married him. - What do you mean? - No, I was joking! After a few years he died, but he remembered you. As his last will, he asked me to come and read the will ... ... exactly one year after his death. Today the year has passed .... - And what's it written? - I know as much as you do. Here is the notary! - Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. Here is the moment you've been waiting for. I bring you the sealed package delivered to me by Arduino Pasti ... ..with his last wishes and the perplexities that tormented him .. .. about ... so to speak, about their gentlemen's character and way of life .. ..and of which he received occasional news in his last years. I have done nothing but dignify the name of the meals. He couldn't have known what good about me: town hall, home Him in the town hall and his wife locked inside the house. - Rather you! - I have a clean criminal record. - I've always made myself respected. - About her ... ..the news arrived hinted at an excessive love of money. the? But if there is no person in the world more generous than me! Ask them! - You speak! - If you want, I can tell my aunt. - As for you, Signor Alfonso ... - Pardon, Count Alfonso ... ... since the title is there, why not use it? True, people? - Eh! Here, it is precisely this megalomania that I wanted to talk about. Megalomania? - Voices of bad people, vulgar enemies! - Voice of the people! And you, Signor Cesaretto? Is he or is he not a lazy, drunkard, messy? According to the points of view. I consider myself a lover of good living. - Yes, yes ... - There is something for you too, Signor Michele. There is talk of a morbid jealousy, of a real tyranny. They are slander! Clara could speak! You tell them! - Better if he doesn't talk, I'll tell him. - No, he is the slanderer! Then they are all slanders, even those that speak of Mr. Piero .. ... like a Don Juan ... Is this kind of indictment part of your duties ? - Does it bother you? - Gossip gives me. - We're here to read a will. - Please, read. Oh yes. Oh, but ... Sorry, I forgot my glasses. Madam, please read yourself , please. "I, Arduino Pasti, in full possession of my faculty ... .. I establish the following: I leave all my surplus substances .. ..to a million and a half .... - A million and a half? - Gentlemen! ... to my wife Caterina ... ... and my nephews Piero, Alfonso, Cesare, Michele and Giuseppe Pasti ... ... provided that ... - Pure conditions! ... the latter prove themselves in the opinion of my wife ... ... and of the notary Helene Marigny, free from serious defects or passions ... ... that can stain or make the Pasti family name unpopular. If one of my grandchildren proves unworthy of the legacy ... ... his share will go to the others. When my wife and the notary ... ... will be able to express a peaceful opinion on my grandchildren ... ..the second part of the will will be read . This is the enclosed package. I believe that as of now they are worthy to benefit from the inheritance. I believe so too, but you have to wait a few days ... ... so we will get to know each other better. - Of course you will know them! Ah, if you know them! Look at those faces! Merry, brothers! 300,000 lire is a nice sum! - 300,000 lire each, right? - Yes, 300,000, but dollars. Okay, dollars .... Dollars, aunt? And how much would it be in lire? - 200,000 million, gentlemen. - 200,000 million! - What does the Count do! - Of lire? - Italians. Long live Italy! Mister count! "Long live Italy!" "Two hundred million!" - A little pimp, Mr. Count! - Go away! No pimp! Gnaw on the nuts! 1,500,000 told me 'this bastard! And he says he wants the pimp! - Shut up! I'll give you the nettles! - Let me talk! - Shut up! I make you swollen! - I have something important to tell you. Shut up! I don't want to hear you! Ugly bitch, 200 million ... .. made me lose! Poisonous spider! Black Widow! I have to talk to you about the widow : the widow is not the notary ... ... and the notary is not the widow. - What turn of words is this? - Let me explain. - Explain yourself! - Ten years ago I worked in the municipality? - Yes, I picked you up like a mouse. One day an urgent request came from South Africa ... ... for a marriage certificate. And whose was it? - Whose? His uncle Arduino, written by him, because I knew him, you know? - Well then? - If your uncle got married ten years ago ... ... how can the girl who was 12 years old at the most then be his aunt ? To hell! There is a foundation. How can you marry a 10 or 12 year old girl? So the real aunt is the brunette lady and the notary is the blonde girl ... ... so much so that the girl, the notary, read the will. It's true! Genius! I melt you. Bravo, it's true! And why this trick, old man? - Ah! They took over to investigate. To spy! - Here. - The widow is smart! - Eh! Then we just have to woo the widow. - Who can do it more than Count Alfonso? my brothers? - For charity! - Well then, old man, come on! Conquering the widow! - Yup. - Tie ', tycoon and pimp! - Thank you, Mr. Count. - That's hundreds of millions! - Meals have blatant luck! It happens like this! Luck always comes to those who don't deserve it, right? - You will certainly be happy, right? - What about? - You have a millionaire boyfriend. - Do you mind? - No, my pleasure... ... I'm afraid for you. With millions you can easily change your mind. - You make me angry! - Aunt from Meals is passing! - Come and see Auntie! - What do I care? - It's worth it! Just like billionaires! What auntie! - Aren't there black women in South Africa ? - But feel it! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Ready? - Yes, there was only one nut to tighten. - Just this? - Yes. - And Signor Piero? - Here I am! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Do you need something? - No, I'm here for the car. - Everything is alright? - Wonderful. - Even that candle ... - All right. These cars.. ... they never break. Who knows how much it cost you! I don't know, I didn't buy it. My uncle gave it to me earlier ... More than a year ago? Impossible. It is no more than three months old! - Oh yes? - Yes. - Then they changed it without my knowledge. - They all look alike! - But the last one ... ... it has hydraulic steering, air conditioning in the back .... Where is it? - I don't know, with all those buttons! - Wonderful! With the inheritance she will also be able to own a Cadillac. I'll buy ten, matching the colors of the ties. - But why are you calling me her? - Did I call you her? - Yup. Sorry, I find it so hard to consider my nephew .. ... a man older than me. - You should be used to ... ... with older people. The uncle was nearly 70 years old. But the poor uncle was very young. It's hard for me to consider you my aunt too. What are you doing? In addition to the truths, the uncle, the will, there are also ... ... the beautiful days, and the countryside here is no less beautiful than in South Africa. - Come on, get in! - Where are you taking me? To get to know the country better and a little of us too. Don't worry, your grandson won't bite! Oh nice! Stupendous! It is truly wonderful! That village looks like a nativity scene. And that over there! Look how cute it is! It is a charm! What a peace! What tranquility! Thanks for bringing me up here. Who lives there in that little house? - Shall we start? - Thing? - The interrogation. - What interrogation? - Come on! You and the notary are investigating .. ... to find out if we deserve that money. - You only talk about money! I never thought about it, but since you came here .... - Don't walk on it! - Did we wreak havoc? - Yup. Did you say money? If I have to become or pretend to be a hermit to get them, I give up. - All you need to do is fix your life. - Marrying me? This was what your uncle wanted. Should I perpetuate the family? There are no millions holding ... ... in front of my beautiful freedom. - Freedom to be a Don Juan with everyone? - Won't you be serious? You will not listen to the rumors going around! After all with you ... - because we are related. - If I hadn't married my uncle ... ..you would be any stranger, and as you can see I don't court you. - Obviously I'm not your type. - Thing? You're one of the women ... ... most beautiful I've met so far, but there is one thing that ... - Come on, talk. - Do you want me to be honest? I don't understand how a beautiful young woman married ... ... that ruin of uncle! Here, I let off steam! When you know, you will judge me differently. We want to go? - But what is there to know? - It's not time yet. So, while you wait ... good friends. Without resentment? Without rancor. That's enough! I got tired! You've been holding me in the mirror for two hours . Make up your mind! - For me I would have already decided, I would leave you at home, closed! - I know. You can't, there is the inheritance! We have to go to the club ... ..if not they say I'm jealous. As if you were! - Well, what do we do? - Let's go let's go. - Let's go then! - Don't you have a more serious dress? - Another dress? What was I to do with it if you have n't taken me anywhere for years ? But this is so frivolous, flirtatious! And then he wraps you up, he shapes you ... Please, let's go to the club tonight ! Going up the stairs ... ... eyes down and don't look anyone in the face! - Avoid crowded spots with youngsters. - Yup. - Sit next to the older ladies! - Yeah. - Don't make me do the part ... ... of the complacent husband! - No. They played! Who will be? Some nuisance! - Oh, Aunt Caterina! - Hello. - What a pleasure!

There is also the uncle, the good soul. It's been 15 years ... ... who was in the cellar. - No, I say ... What cellar? 15 years standing there, watching us and protecting us. - Actually, it looks like it's been put on recently. - In fact since yesterday. - We changed the upholstery yesterday . - And Clara? - Clara? - Is not at home? - And where are you going, poor thing? - God forbid he wasn't home. - As? - Aren't you free to go out whenever you want? - Yup! Then it is true what they say, that you are jealous. - Not so much, they call him Othello! - Macche Otello! No, he jokes. - I carry her around every night. - Yes, at the tabarin! No, what a tabarin! Exaggerated! But tonight I'm taking her dancing. - But go? - Yes, in fact she is trying on the dress. - As a nun? - Macche! A dress to go dancing. - I'm calling her now.

I wanted to take Clara dancing, but if you hold back, we can stay at home. - I don't want to deprive Clara of a fun. - He's right. - I'd like to stay home for you. - Then let's stay home! - Not at all! - In fact, I suggest we all go dancing together. - Let's go dancing! - How will you dress? - This is the dress. - I told you it was ready. - Dressed as a nun! - Ready like this? - You can't go dancing like that! - Let's take care of it. - Yup. - How dare you kiss her? - It's nothing, you'll see tonight ... ..when the hug! - And why? - He's gonna dance with me, right? - I don't make her dance with you! - No? - No. If you don't dance with me, dance with the television technician. - And what dance are you doing for her? - Don't worry, an ancient dance. - Yup! - Which is? - The minuet! And where did you stay, at the minuet? But please me! Let's do an Argentine tango. - As? - She takes the lady and hugs her breast - Nun can go! - Shut up, alright! - No! - She squeezes her little hand over her heart. - No! - And then it's cheek to cheek. - What's this? It means cheek to cheek. But it can't go! I die! It's nice to see two brothers who love each other so well. And now I present to you the new Mrs. Clara.

Curiosity and envy devour them. - Isn't your wife too low-cut? - For the notary it is regulatory. - Let's Dance? - Piero, no! First they make the guests dance ... ... and then the members of the family. - They're young, let's let them dance. No, young people are well educated. Piero, do your duty! The notary! For me it is an honor and a pleasure to dance with her. - Are you having fun, Clara? - Yes a lot. And two! Umberto, would you please me to make my aunt dance? Make the aunts dance?

Today I placed a device in the notary Bardelli's house. - Would you like to dance? - Maybe! But with whom? With that lady there. - Eh! - Then invite her. You will see that the husband will say that he does not dance ... ... with those who do not know. - So? - Say you know the notary. Since the husband is a friend of the notary, see that he will make her dance. You are welcome. - Thanks. - You are tired? - No. - Shall we dance? - Do you prefer to watch? - Yes, yes. - I would like to, but .... - Will you, lady? - My wife doesn't dance with strangers. Not even with an acquaintance of the notary? - If you are an acquaintance of the notary ... - Eh! - The palto! - Macche palto! Ridiculous! - But it gets cold! - Macche! Sit down, look good! Down! And you, Signor Cesare, don't you dance with me? I would be very happy, but I don't know how to dance. - Yes he knows! I saw it!

What would you say? - I'd answer you. - You are really nice! Oh yes? Tonight your conquests will say otherwise. - Hurry up and tell them I'm your aunt. - They know. So why does that girl look at me with hate? That unpleasant has fallen in love with him. It shows! - Even him. - To think I was under the illusion that he would marry me. - Forget it! But remember the riddle! - What do you mean? The boy will almost certainly become very rich. Listen to me... ... if you do what I tell you ... Come on, come on. - How good, huh? - Good boy! - What a teacher! - What a pain! - Mrs. - What are you doing? Are you leaving now? No, stay with us.

"My wife and the notary, in turn, will have known you ... ... even if out of greed you have shown yourself different from how you are. "I hope that you have been through ... ... the worst 15 days of your life. No because? It was 15 beautiful days.

Your dear aunt wanted to make my loneliness gloomy ... ... splendid, golden. - With Uncle Arduino's money! With money! So do we want to share our happiness with your brothers? Do we want to be good, understanding, generous with them? Huh? - No! - I knew it! Do you think I trusted him? Peppi ', you tell him that he chose the worst .... Is he dead? Calm down, grandchildren, do not be alarmed! Since I like you all, I, Caterina Marchetti, widow Pasti ... ... I decide and arrange that what is exceeded by my third widow ... ... be divided among you equally ... ... since I am sure that in a year you will deserve it. Take off her handkerchief, go! - This 200 million jealousy is beautiful ! - 200 million! For 200 million you also buy television.

Giovanni, are you all right? - All right, Count! - Doghouse! - No, Giovanni, one moment! No more count! - Okay, lady! - From now on, stop counting! - And Count Alfonso? Since I entered your life, you will no longer be count ... ... and you will only ever do what I say. - As you want, dear, I will do everything to satisfy you. - Good boy. - Lets go to the mountain? - Well no! Let's go where I say! Aho! I'm afraid this ... But how did Uncle Arduino die? For me, the count inherited the collar!
