Police station wait here, please. - What is the problem? - My grandson is missing. - As of when? - This morning. - Where? - Just when he got out of school. - Oh, did you go to pick him up? - Yes, as always. Ok. - Right? - Yes, but he did not come home. Come on! Sit down. Listen to me, this time you're going to make it to trial alive, but next time, the moment I see you, I'll crack your skull. You bloody exhibitionist! And in front of children and women! I just can't help it, detective! Paolo, the superintendent is looking for you. My boss saved you this time. Gino, take this pervert's statement. So, our children cannot be safe on the streets now? The police should be there to protect them! What a carnage. Who was he? His name was Franco perotti. He was a drug addict. He was also a painter. He was killed in his studio last night. And just like in the warnes Kelly case, you know, the rapist, we found this again. No one has hit on me all night. And Mohammad is going to get very angry if you don't give him money, right? Listen, idiot, leave that guy alone. "That guy" doesn't deserve you, all right? Things would be better if you were with me, Lucia. With you? You're worse than he is. I can't stand you any more. I'm leaving. Yeah, leave! One day I'll show you what I'm made of... Bitch. Another crime, paolo. And we found another dragonfly. It was a prostitute this time, right? She was killed on via prebesse, near number 26. Nice neighborhood. Sure. The girl had arrived in Milan not long ago. She used to go to those clubs and... Come on, spit it out. Ok. You will be in charge of this. Thank god. And should I thank you for this opportunity? Of course. But you can continue with your perverts if you want to. The thing is, those "higher-up" wanted vittorio to take care of this case. You don't have a very good reputation after what happened in the maretti case. But I talked with them. All right, don't worry. I accept the case. Paolo! Paolo! I'm here silvana! Oh, the policeman is in the kitchen? - What are you cooking? - Spaghetti. What a nice housewife you are, my detective. Today barucchi came to the boutique. He told me pietro wants us to come for dinner on Saturday. Edmundo, Ingrid and professor campitelli will be there too. What's the matter? - I'm worried. - Problems? I've been asked to be in charge of a difficult case. The dragonflies one. Each time I think about it... But this is your big moment, right? I hope everything goes well this time. I hope so. You're nervous. You'll end up burning everything. Help me. You need to use this. Move. Barucchi also told me he loved my last designs. You know? He wants to organize a fashion show in Rome in the spring. He told me about big projects. I'm sure he'll be one of the most interesting dressmakers... He has a lot of imagination, and he'll succeed sooner or later. No! No! No! All the victims had a bad lifestyle. Drug addicts, prostitutes, perverts... We have to admit that in that sense, the killer or killers are cleaning up the city, right? - Don't joke around, paolo. - I'm sorry. But when I see that some of the victims are relatives of such important people as commander marinoni's son, I think that... At least we have this button now. This time the killer left more than a dragonfly. Yes, luckily it is not a very common button. Explain yourself. Haute couture. Handcrafted. Only haute couture clothing would have a button like this. - Women's clothing? - I think so. Probably a coat. But we are still at the beginning. Well, silvana knows people in the haute couture sector, did you know that? She's friends with a famous dressmaker, vittorio darucchi. He might be able to find out if any of his colleagues used these buttons. I hope so. The problem is that the killer isn't going to stop with this one. His future victims should watch out. Drug addicts, prostitutes, well-known scum... This time, the killer entered the house like he owned the place. He even used the key. Which means that he was a friend of the commander's son. He caught him and his two friends in an orgy, and he killed them. But we still don't know anything? Well, we know she's an elegant woman. Or maybe a man who was wearing a woman's coat. Touch?. An expensive coat, perhaps. It could also be someone who had those buttons, but wasn't wearing the coat. But we should start with that button, right? Sure, of course. They were very beautiful. Yes, one of them... Was called Marina ballufi. Nineteen years old, university student, the daughter of divorced parents. They couldn't believe their daughter's second life. The other one is gracia de Luca. She was a stripper. She did drugs. But it doesn't make sense. We're still investigating their lives. It's a shame. They were so young. Well, we'll have to go to your architect friend's house. Finally! You'll relax for a couple of hours and forget about those damned dragonflies. Thank you. I congratulate you, paolo. I know you're in charge of a very important case. The one with the dragonflies. I hope this time you don't have to use the scaporella method during your interrogations. The truth is, I use it when necessary. It might be useful this time. I understand your obsession, but it's your job. Dragonflies covered in blood. Thank you. Yes, very detailed ones. I'd even say they enjoyed making them. The killer uses the victims' blood and leaves them like a calling card. It reminds me of an old chaldean rite. Chaldean? Yes. In that ancient civilization, those in higher ranks of society used to mark the clothes of prostitutes, homosexuals, everyone that was a disgrace, with a dragonfly sewed to their clothes. It was like a mark to differentiate them from everybody else. If their crime was very severe, or they repeated it, they would end up being torn apart. The dragonfly mark contained the blood of the victim, and they would put it in the walls of the temples as a warning. What? That's barbaric! Be careful, vittorio. One of those barbarians is still out there! Well, in that case, you should be careful too, my dear Ingrid. Oh, well, don't worry. Just don't do that again. However, no one should be offended. We all know each other. And the truth is that even in our refined society, there are many people that are guilty enough to be punished by chaldeans. Right, architect? That, my dear edmundo, is something you would know better than me. There are some places where you go and I don't. Of course, status still exists. But still, the presence of the dragonflies amazes me because its ancient meaning is not well-known unless you're a history expert. Then, professor, you could be the killer. - Me? - Killer! Killer! Sure, it could be him, or anyone. Not me. Someone who knew about the meaning of the bloodstained dragonflies. Of course. Oh, come on, let's stop talking about this. I suggest we go to villa lampini. And edmundo owes us an invitation because of his fridges' success at the trade fair. That's a great idea! Let's go! I think it'll be fun to join you, even if I don't write my book today. Well, I'm a bit tired. And I have to work early tomorrow. You two are so boring! Come on, paolo, you came here to forget about the case! Please, this is an invitation from my company. We shouldn't miss this. No, thank you. Have fun, see you soon! - Next week we'll meet at my house! - Goodbye. Goodbye. Paolo, paolo, if I find out anything about the button, I'll tell you immediately. Don't forget. It's very important. Thank you, vittorio. Hello, ruggero. I need an eight-letter word that starts with you haven't called me. I was waiting for you. Oh, I know now: Necklace. This crossword wasn't easy. But I managed to finish it. I'm not bad at this. Ruggero, please, listen to me. Yeah, I know. It's always the same thing. I don't call you, I don't see you. But you know my business is complicated. And I need to dedicate a lot of time to my job. Ruggero, I need you. Don't worry. I'll seal the deal with Mohammad tonight. A very important one. And I'll be able to be with you. Go to the theater tonight. I need the money so that I can seal the deal as soon as possible. When will I be able to go? She'll be ready in half an hour. But this time it has to be in the coffin. Yes, everything is ready. Well, you'll have to pay more this time. This type of service is very special. Necrophilia is an expensive vice, professor. Here you go. Have fun, professor. Hello? Yes, it's me. Sure, you can come up. Everything's ready. Is she here yet? Yes, she's the blond one sitting at that table. - Ornella? - Yes. Milanese sent me. You know what this is about. I do, but I'd rather talk at home. Ok. Would you like a drink? It was a gift from a friend. I haven't seen milanese in a while. He is a very nice guy. He called me. No. I don't know much about Lisa. She wasn't very talkative. But I imagine she would have someone protecting her. She would go out with a guy called Mohammad kaburi. She was one of the girls he protects. But Lisa was very naive and thought she was his favorite. Do you know where can I find him? He normally goes to a garage on the outskirts. - Do you know the place? - Yes. But be careful. Don't worry. Give me the address. But... you're not staying? No. Thank you for everything. Bye! Say hi to milanese for me. You've been warned, friend. Stop bothering Mohammad or you'll see us again. It's not serious this time. They really beat you up. - They did. - Yeah. Wait, let me help you. Slowly. There we go. What happened, paolo? Good morning, superintendent. That milanese really got me into trouble. I got in touch with a friend of Lisa, the dead stripper. She gave me an address and... Where did you get in touch? At Malibu's. Then we went to her house. Then she told me Lisa's boyfriend was a guy named Mohammad kaburi, who has a group of girls, and has very selective clients. Which means that if we keep investigating this, we might find something. Which wouldn't be very pleasant for you, right? I've been in worse situations. There's always a way to escape. The important thing is that we go ahead. No matter what. You were telling me that... There's a guy called... Muhammad kaburi. Keep talking, please. The thing is, I went to the place the girl told me. And kaburi's friends were the ones who gave me such a warm welcome. They were dressed as Nazis. And they were very young. One of them told me to stop snooping around. As I understand then, it's a white slavery gang. And I hope we can break it up soon. But we can't give up our main goal. And the truth is we only have a button. And the dragonflies, of course. And some corpses. Next time, be careful and stop trying to solve the case on your own without our help. You know I appreciate you. I wouldn't want to have to pick you up piece by piece. What a nice birthday you're having. With your head broken, and that horrible shirt. And my present hasn't arrived yet. I'm never trusting sellers again. "We'll send it right away, miss." Paolo. Paolo, are you listening to me? Come on, eat something. Lisa Anderson. Stripper, among many other things. Her clients were sexually complicated people. It was very scary to find her in a coffin, where she prepared herself for a client who enjoyed that kind of stuff. And Mohammad kaburi is related to this? I'm sure of it. He and his gang manage a part of this city's prostitution. We'll get them sooner or later. At least I hope so. Your present! It was the bellboy. Happy birthday to you... Wait. Open it. No! No! "This head is Mohammad kaburi's. A despicable man that my justice decided to kill. I'm sure you'll be thankful for this, detective, since he was the one who told his gang to beat you up. They'll all be dead soon, since the cleansing of this city is my main objective. Yours truly, the dragonfly killer." Can I speak to detective paolo scaporella? It's urgent. Tell him it's lucchino. Lucchino milanese. Detective, it's me. I'm sorry about what happened. We can't trust those bitches. But now I have important information. For real. I know who Lisa's client was the day she was killed. Yeah, sure. I'll wait for you in vito morano's scrapyard. In one hour. Don't forget to bring what we agreed on. Bye. Stop! Stop or I'll shoot! Wow, what a nice surprise! Don't shoot me, please! Don't! I would love to, you pig! But you have to tell me many things. I swear I didn't kill milanese. I found him dead inside of the car. - Oh, really? - I swear. I didn't want to kill him. I just wanted to teach him a lesson! He was a snitch! You arrested Mohammad because of him! We'll have time to check out what you're saying. Move! I can't stand up. I think my leg is broken! Crawl then. Crawl or I'll shoot you. I swear! I didn't kill milanese! We don't kill anyone! We have an agreement with Mohammad. He would give us drugs, women and money, and we would protect him! But we don't know anything else! But you shot me. Why should I believe you? I think you killed milanese, as well as others! Why were you at the scrapyard? Why? Speak! Why? I've already told you. I've told you a million times! Believe me! Bloody scum! I'll crush you! Stop it! He's telling the truth and you know it! He needs a hospital. You're risking too much now! Get this scum out of my sight before I kill him! Come on! It's vittorio. He found out about the button. It's about time. - Hi, paolo. - Hi, vittorio. - I know who made the buttons. - Speak. It was herminio facchetti, an artisan who lives in navigli. - I have his address in the car. - Let's go. Ciao, silvana! - Are you looking for someone? - Yes, herminio facchetti. Maria, who are you talking to? Two gentlemen who are looking for herminio! That's my husband. What do you want from him? - To speak with him. - You can't. Why not? He killed himself last week. He jumped out of a window. I can show you the place where he landed. I would like to go to his house. Take us there. Yeah, sure. Maria! Give me the key. Quickly! Everything looks the same. We told his family to come and take his things. They're from sancosa. But they haven't come yet. And the new tenants are arriving in two days. What was herminio like? I mean, his personality. He was calm and didn't talk much. At least not usually. But when he drank, he would become a bad guy. Did someone visit him? Not many people, but most of the visits were about work. He must have been very good because he worked for very important people. How strange. There are no order books or bills. Don't touch anything. And close the door. I'll send some men to take a thorough look. Come on, vittorio. I need that money. Yes. I need it. No. I've been thinking about it every single day. I should have left the stripper's house the day you killed her. Yes, and you killed all those people. You should pay me soon. Yes, I'll go to the fair and you'll give me what we agreed on. Huh? Yes, no, ok. I'll leave Italy immediately. Bees circus "dear detective, I'm sorry I had to kill an acquaintance of yours, but the 'trustworthy' sandro campitelli was in reality a pervert capable of the most horrible acts. A depraved mind. Investigate his life, you'll enjoy it. This scum didn't have the right to live amongst us. I'll ask you again to stop investigating my case. I appreciate you, and I'll suggest you take some days off. It's a friend's advice. The dragonfly killer." - Crazy. Crazy bastard. - Calm down. You'll get him sooner or later. Sooner or later. But meanwhile, he'll keep killing mercilessly and relentlessly. You'll get him. I can feel it. Feelings? I need facts. Real facts! How are you and Ingrid doing? You still haven't answered. How are you and Ingrid doing? I think our marriage is on the rocks. And I think she has a lover. You know how she is. She's never obeyed anything or anyone. Maybe if we had had children, this wouldn't have happened. But are you sure she's cheating on you... Or is it just an assumption? I'm not sure, and I don't want to be sure. I love her very much, and I can't live without her. Isn't it funny that a well-known playboy is suffering because of his wife's disloyalty? I saw vittorio this morning. He's taking his search for the person who bought the killer's button very seriously. He was very nervous. I think he might be close to discovering it. Who's this? Oh, vittorio, tell me. You discovered who it was? I'll wait at the police station. Hurry. One hour? Ok, but just one. I'm nervous. Ciao, vittorio. I'd like to speak to vittorio darucchi. I need a car. Tell gradi, carapellese and marinni to come. Yes, sir. What's the matter, paolo? Vittorio is dead. - Vittorio? - Yes. That's impossible. He called to tell me he had discovered something very important. But the killer found out about it, too. And he wasn't able to tell me. I need a drink. Look at this. Before dying, he drew this. He was trying to tell me something. It's a message. It's being decoded right now in the technical cabinet. It won't be easy. Paolo, does this mark tell you something? What could it mean? Look at the shape. I don't know. Maybe a flower? Or a cross. Or an insect. Yeah, sure. It could be any of those things. I think I've seen it before. But I can't remember where. Was it a mole, a tattoo, or a birthmark? Who was the person? But why should we interpret vittorio's drawing like that? It's a feeling. But I'm sure I've seen it. Where? No one knows what humans think of in the last moment of their lives. Why shouldn't we think that vittorio was giving us the key to finding the killer? Well... I see you're having fun. But it'll be useless. I'm exhausted. If you don't mind, I'll go to sleep. This situation is intolerable, paolo. The press won't stop attacking us. Our bosses are afraid of the public losing its Patience. People are panicking. We have nothing except some deaths, too many of them! They'll dismiss us in the end, and not voluntarily. Some of them have even suggested replacing us. I understand, superintendent. I knew something like this would happen. But I have a clue this time! I'm sure of it! I'll trust you again, paolo. But you need to hurry up. Because the killer won't take a break. I spoke to edmundo again the other day. I'm worried about him. He's going crazy. His problem with Ingrid's getting worse. And she won't stop making it worse. And what about him? How does he behave? Always messing around. Always proud of winning women's hearts. That lifestyle led him to his current situation. Everyone has their secrets. Who could imagine Sandra's double life? And vittorio's terrible fate. They were all our friends. And not everyone on this planet is a Saint. What are you doing? I'm looking for that mark. But I don't know... In these photographs? Yes, because of my feminine intuition. Oh, no. Paolo, not now please. You have to work. Paolo! Ingrid! You're insane! You know I don't want you to visit me here. It's dangerous! And my fellows don't want more problems. I can't stand it anymore, ruggero. I can't stand my husband. Let's run away! Stupid! They could have followed you! And after what happened to Mohammad, and your friend killed here at the fair, this is getting more and more dangerous! The police are here, snooping around everywhere! Let's leave, ruggero. Sooner or later they'll find out about the coat. They'll find out I bought the buttons, and I'm scared. That's not my problem. Besides, do you think it would be easy to leave the gang? If I leave, I'll risk my life. For sure. Do you see, idiot? They've followed you! The police are here! Ruggero! No! There was a gang of drug dealers hiding at the fair. Oh, maybe that's why sandro was killed there. The killer wanted you to investigate there. Probably. But shockingly, we found Ingrid there... With the gang's leader. - Ingrid? - Yes. She was the leader's lover. We sent that ruggero to hell. He was a transvestite. A drug dealer. The worst part is that Ingrid might be involved in the dragonfly case. No, I don't believe that. It's impossible. She confessed it was she who bought the famous buttons. What else did she say? We couldn't interrogate her, she was in shock. And she's under medical care. I hope we can interrogate her soon. I don't think she's guilty. Ingrid has many flaws, but she would never get involved with a killer. - What are you doing? - Well... I think I have discovered something. Look at that. Can you see it? Look at that arm. Here. That mole is exactly like vittorio's drawing. See how I was right, paolo? Here, look at the arm. The mark is exactly like vittorio's drawing! It's very blurry. You can't even see if this is a man or a woman's arm. But you can see the mole clearly. Even if you're right, and it's what vittorio drew, that would be it. A mere coincidence. If we only knew whose arm that is... This photo was taken at edmundo's swimming pool, right? Yes, but there were so many people... Well, just keep having fun with your investigation. They're not calling me, and I'm nervous. I'll go back to the station to check on Ingrid. You don't believe me! You don't believe in feminine intuition, no men do! But I'll prove you wrong! Deductions, intuitions, I need facts! Ingrid doesn't deserve your help. She cheated on you with everyone. She would always make you look stupid. And what did I do to her? I cheated on her many times, too. Even with you! Now she is in a big trouble, and I won't leave her on her own. I'm fed up with you! Go back to your stupid husband! I'm sick of everything. You're a fool. Go on, go and help her! I will. And I will confess who she lent the coat to. I don't want her to be blamed unfairly. You know they stole it from me. Try to convince the police about that. I won't forgive you for this, edmundo. You'll regret this. I mean it. Come on, Ingrid. Calm down. Continue. Yes. It's true. I bought the buttons. I wanted them for a coat. It was an exclusive one. But one day, Claudia volpini asked me to borrow it. The architect's wife. And of course I gave it to her. Later on, she told me she had lost it. Or that someone stole it. I felt very sorry, but I didn't think it was important. Then, when I found out about the button, I panicked. But I couldn't say anything to the police. I was scared about ruggero. Very scared. Number three, please. It happened around midnight. He was hit hard with a big object. Only a very strong person could have done this. Would you say he was hit with a golf club? Sure, why not. But the person was a very strong man. I don't think so, doctor. In golf, the strength of the stroke depends on the swing, which requires more technique than strength. Even a woman could have done it. Yes. I know one who does it very well. And, like always, there was a dragonfly, right? Yes. Like always. - Here's the report, paolo. - Thank you, marini. Parents, francesco and Monica. The father was professor in the faculty of science. A morphine addict. He ended up killing himself. The mother disappeared before her husband's death and she ran away with another guy. She ended up as a prostitute. She had nervous breakdowns, now is hospitalized in a clinic. How could I ignore this? I hope I'm wrong this time. Maybe... Grandi, prepare your notebook. - Sure. - Come on. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Marcelo. Is the lady here? No, the lady left yesterday, and her husband will be either working or in his studio. Well, then I'll leave. Goodbye, Marcelo. Bye, miss silvana. - Miss silvana. - Good morning, giulia. Is Mr. volpini here? He is working, but he'll be back soon. Will you wait for him? Yes, thank you. Caraperesse, take the golf clubs to the laboratory, it's urgent. Hurry up. All right. Golden? Apartment 30. Commander marinoni's son... Where we found the three bodies? Yes. - Where is the phone? - At the office. Let's go. It's very late. I don't want to miss the bus. If you don't mind, I'll leave. Don't worry, you can leave. It's very strange that Mr. volpini hasn't arrived yet. If he doesn't, you can always close the door by pushing it. And please, turn off the lights. - Sure. - Bye, miss silvana. Bye. Paolo, I have a surprise for you. I think I know who has that mole. And by deduction! I'm going to Claudia's house. Why is she so nosy? The crimes of the chaldeans mother sin... death sflvana. Detective, we found this hat. It's silvana's. There's an exit. It will take us to the unfinished part of the building. Let's go. Claudia. Claudia cheated on me. I saw her with that scum edmundo. I believed in her. But you're all the same. All humans are worthless. We need to destroy them all. All of them! My parents were scum, too. But I'll keep killing. I'll destroy sin and corruption. And now... Sflvana! - Paolo! - Sflvana! Paolo!
