But is the minister aware of it ? Yes, the minister said. To visit him in his office. No, no, no ! I don't do antichambers In the corridors of ministries !

Yes, the briefcase. Under the guise of helping me, "Give me the briefcase," she said. - You think she wanted to... - I think nothing and know nothing. She asked me three times for the briefcase, though. kind sir, today on the trains are travelling professionals. Beautiful, attractive, they chat And you don't know how it turns out. Nothing gets to me. Even if they are attractive, I don't trust them. - is this my suite. - Here it is, yes. - It is suite number 2, in the centre of the train. - Good. No one will bother you today, the train is half vacant. Why is it vacant ? With these annoying strikes people are afraid of being left halfway. Well, and aren't you right ? Let's hope well. Oh. Travel. I'm telling you, people who travel Is an impossible thing. Ah. (Male, speaker) We inform you. That the crew is at your disposal and wish you a safe journey. oh, thank you, that's what I need.

Here we go, into the tunnel and they even turn off the light. But I say to you ! (Armando) Well, what's going on? (Armando) Who came in? (Armando) Oh there, sorry, but who are you? - It's me.. Here she is again, and what are you doing here ? If you don't mind, I'll settle in here. What, "If you don't mind ?" This is a private suite. - Is it a private suite ? I didn't know. - Yes. Ah, you didn't know ? Be patient, you don't have a ticket with a reserved seat? Yes, but there are some guys, who are basketball players they were bothering me. Really, do you think so ? Young people are a nuisance. Well, what does that mean ? I mean it's more fun for you to take a trip with young people than come and be bored with an old man like me. Old ? Who said you are old ? All right, never mind. Spare yourself the compliments, please. - No compliments. - Eh, no. I'm just saying that some young people sometimes they are so boring ! It is a matter of opinion. Is yours this ? Well, let's respect it. - Can I smoke ? - "Can I smoke ?" your is already smoking. Smoke away, I smoke cigars. - Ah. - Yes. "Italian Locomotives in the World." If you don't mind, Can I a take a look. What is it ? Ah. - Don't miss the mark. - No. There is a sign. Ah. Ah. (Federica) Ah. Don't tell me you're interested in steam locomotives ? Oh, when I was young. Everything is now electrified. They are old steamers, But they give a feeling of great power. Yes. It must have been very romantic riding on those trains. "Locomotive Dakota" "A project of Engineer Armando Andreoli." "for the Brazilian Railways." Don't tell me That you are the engineer Armando Andreoli ? Yes, miss. If you don't mind, I designed that locomotive. It is fantastic ! So you have also been to Brazil ? Brazil, Costa Rica, Nicaragua. You can be say that I worked for the railways since I was born. - How wonderful ! - Yes. I am very happy to make this trip with such an important person. My name is Federica, can we call each other ? No. - Why not ? - Because I don't see any reason, sorry. What is this trend? We barely know each other, in Bologna we say goodbye, I don't see the reason For which we must call each other by name. Excuse me. - Will you stay long in Bologna ? - Ah, I don't know. - I have a conference, depending on how it goes. - Ah. Are you married ? Yes. - Isn't your wife coming with you ? - No. - Why ? - I am a widower. Ah. Where are you staying here in Bologna ? How, where do I stay ? As in, Which hotel are you sleeping in tonight ? If you permit, I will not tell you. Why ? Because I have a bad temper And I am also wary. Ah, excuse me. Wary of me ? Not just you, I distrust all people I don't know, And because I don't know you, I don't see the reason For which I must tell you. Where I am sleeping tonight in Bologna. But what is the harm ? What's wrong with that ? It's that I don't know if I'm sleeping in Bologna, Because if there is no strike, I leave on the first train to Rome. What if there is a strike ? If there is a strike ? No more questions, I have to absent myself for a little while. Where are you going? I am going to the toilet. - Do you go to the toilet with your briefcase ? - Yes, with the briefcase. - Why? - Just like that. - May I? - Please do. Here you go, thanks. (Armando) Oh, this one still thinks about the briefcase ! Excuse me, do you know what time it is ? - Are you a basketball player ? - Yes. It's time for you to wake up, young man. But who are you ? Couldn't always be predicted what was happening, you know ? Do you think that when we were laying out the tracks. 40 degrees in the shade, the monkeys, mischievous, From above the tree branches, They would throw coconuts on our heads. There was a lot of tension In the camp at night, Because we were surrounded by Indians. We were afraid to do things That were not part of their culture and their way of life. Fear. Did you know that when we built the bridge over Rio Negro, we were infested with piranhas. We caught an anaconda. We opened his belly And inside was a live monkey. What an extraordinary life ! I wish this journey would never end to always listen to your stories. Unfortunately, our journey is over, dear young lady. We arrived in Bologna and we have to prepare ourselves. "Come on, boom." Eh, I have told you the whole story. Unfortunately, I don't know whether I have made all the necessary notes to make my presentation tonight. Let's hope for the best. Engineer, engineer ! - Engineer, your umbrella, engineer ! - Who is ? - You forgot your umbrella. - Oh, thank you very much. Where are you going ? Are you going straight to the congress ? Where is it ? It is in the Main Square, the City Hall. Ah, it's near my little hotel, The Clock. There are no more cabs, can I come with you ? Can you come ? I am already late. Is the Clock near the municipality ? - All right, come. - Thank you. Let's go quickly, though, it's late. Excuse me, Miss, if this is unlawful. What are you doing alone in that little hotel? I'll meet my fianc? who lives in Trent. Ah, I get it, You meet each other halfway. Yes, we have to decide the date of our wedding. If you have nothing to do, come and have dinner with us. Having dinner with you, are you kidding ? Boyfriends want to be alone, don't they ? Yes, we have been engaged for five years, But when we are alone we get so bored. Hmm, but if you are so bored, why did you decide to get married ? Sometimes it comes down to marriage Just when one should break up. Ah, you got it ! It happens. We are here. Here we are, then goodbye, young lady. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. It was a very interesting trip with you. - I we hope to meet again in Rome. - Rome is big, miss. - I don't think so. - Never say never. Never say never, eh. However, It was a pleasure for me as well. I wish you all the best for your marriage. Here, Escort the young lady to the hotel. Please be quiet. Thank you. The commencement of work on the highway is again under discussion. Due to the massive intervention of supporters of the doubling of the railway line, of which we have here in the hall a notable representative. Engineer Armando Andreoli. Silence, silence ! (Together) Get out, go outside. Silence ! (Man) And always him. Silence, silence ! Silence ! Engineer ? But...Miss, what are you doing here? My fianc? phoned me, arrives tomorrow afternoon. - I had nothing to do... - Sit here. - Thank you. - Can't you see that everyone is looking at you ? - They stopped. - I thought. they froze as soon as you entered. I thought I would visit you here at your convention. Yes, you thought wrongly, because I don't own the congress. Everyone here is agitated, everyone is in turmoil. Yes and no that they make me have the response. (Speaker) A moment of attention, Engineer Armando Andreoli, author of the project which is now in the hands of the Minister, Will make his speech. Now he's calling me. Come, engineer, come. Go away, go away ! What am I coming? "Come." Can't you hear them ? Please have a seat, don't worry. - Engineer, go, don't be afraid. - What did you say? Afraid? I am afraid of no one. Of course I'm going. - Here I am, here I am ready. - Go! I obey, I obey. - Go home. - Enough ! - (Man) Go away, shame ! - (Man 2) Go away, shame on you! (Man 3) Go back to Rome ! Go steal somewhere else ! When in the postwar period, Europe found itself at a dramatic crossroads. of making the huge choices, including transport on tyres and rail transport... of this historic... of this historic... of this historic concern, I say that I have never had neither doubts nor uncertainties. The are many interveners, and I see them here, they have come here affected by bad ideas to contest my truths. Here is the evidence ! The evidence ? The evidence is here in my speech. Everything is here, everything is written. My proposals are of national interest. Not of private interest ! Not of interest to your constituents Paid to support to the last extreme your business interests without showing any respect for those who disagree with you. (Man) Enough with the lies, stop it. (Man) Get the fuck out of here! - Do not respond. - Of course I won't be responding. - Because I'm leaving. - No. - Yes, yes, I'm leaving. - Please. I don't want to stay not a minute longer here. - Finish your presentation. - Come on, let me through. Don't you understand that these animals are shouting and screaming to be filmed on television? (Armando) I am ashamed to have come. For heaven's sake, I'm leaving, goodbye. Engineer, don't give up. - Why do you want to give them satisfaction? - What are you saying? What do you want, too ? - Let me go. - Why do they do this ? When that bastard was still in diapers, I went to work overseas not to bow my head to them. (Armando) I am not like him, rascals! (Armando) They took the bribes. To challenge me ! You old fart, I would have smashed your face in. - What do you want to do ? - I'll break your face. Let's fistfight, I'll show you who the wrecker is. Go back to Rome ! Go back to Rome !, go ! Do as your bosses tell you ! Your bosses, fill the streets with cars, infest the air Until we all die from poisoning. - He brought his geisha. - What? Who's geisha? Geisha will be you, you fool. I work, I'm not taking bribes like you. (Federica) Engineer. (Man) We scared the shit out of him, we scared him. The usual illiterates, scoundrels, thieves ! Curse to me and when I joined to this convention. I didn't have to... The briefcase, the briefcase ! Here it is, engineer. Do you know that you are unpredictable ? Thank you, miss. You were very helpful to me. I must thank you very much, Miss, for your assistance this evening it was so uncivilized and degrading. you were better off with your boyfriend. - No, I feel sorry for you. - Here. How could anybody face such people who were so rude? - Hmm. - Are all congresses like this ? But no, miss, I came here to present my project. I knew straight away when I came, that no one would listen to me. Because they had it all planned. They had prepared everything against me. Do you know that you are right ? - They didn't want to let you give your speech. - No. Perhaps they were worried that you would make a too convincing proposals. - Rascals, delinquents. - Where are you going? - Uncivilized ! - Come here. Did you see that guy? He wanted to punch me in the face. - It is better to leave those people behind. - Yes. Of course, let this evening serve as a lesson to me. - I will never set foot here again. You are right. The most important thing now is to go home without delay. You know what I'll do, miss? I call a cab, go to the station and I take the first train to Rome. - At the station ? - Yes. - Do you want to leave like this at night? - In a way you're right. You know it's not acceptable here ? I did not make reservations at any hotels. There is not a room even for the price of gold. I have an idea, there is a small hotel nearby. It is a little hotel, surely they will find you accommodation. - Really ? - Yes. Are you sure that here they won't refuse us accommodation? - Then you don't trust what I say. - May I? - Let me do the talking. - YES. - Good evening. - Good evening, miss. How can I serve you in ? Good evening. The gentleman cannot depart because of the strike. We stayed in three hotels, But it is sold out. - Do you happen to have a single ? - Look at this. I don't know, there's the trade-show, the dental conference. Unfortunately, all the rooms are occupied. You don't even have a single ? Nothing, miss, this is a small hotel. The rooms we have are all booked. - So. - Wait a minute. this evening a french couple should arrive - "Yes ?" - "Let's try this. If by 10 p.m. they don't show up, the room is yours. - Thank you. - Then we just have to wait. - You can have dinner in our restaurant. - Good. I am sure it will be a wonderful experience and enjoy our culinary specialities. (Armando) That's a good idea. (Hotelier) Forgive me, every time there's a thunderstorm the lights goes out. (Hotelier) Luigi, Escorts the guests to the restaurant. - (Armando) Yes, let's go. - (Federica) Let's go. - Ah-ah, nice ! - Hmm. Thank you. Leave it, I'll do it. - Do you ? - Yes, I like to do that. Ah, I like pork sausage. - Do you still want one ? - Yes. Thank you. - Some puree. - Yes. Do you like Bolognese specialities ? I don't eat them, only once a year you can even taste it. - It's delicious, it's tasty. - Go easy on the meat. It is not good for those with high nitrogenemia. What do you know about high nitrogenemia ? I'm a nurse, work at Holy Spirit. Yes, I know she is a nurse, but the fact that I have high nitrogenemia what do you know about that? Why did you lie to me? Did I lie to you? When? On the way, when you left from the train suite, your mobile phone rang and I answered it. - And who was it ? - It was a voice from beyond. It was your wife. My wife? What about my wife ? Why did you say you were a widower? This is why? You see, Miss, during that trip, I was making the notes To make the speech in Bologna. She would interrupt me and ask, he would ask me, he would ask me again. To cut a long story short I said I was a widower, did I do wrong ? No, but do you always do this with all the women you meet on the train? No, don't say that. This is the first time such an encounter has happened to me. It must be something that was deduced by your subconscious. What does the subconscious have to do with it?, sorry ? I don't know, perhaps unknowingly you want to get rid of your wife. No, no. Ours is a marriage that has lasted for 40 years. We love each other like the first day. Why you do not believe me? - If you say so, I believe you. - I do. That's it. Here it is. It's here. Gentlemen, I'm sorry, right now... - I heard, the French have arrived. - Correct. - So ? - The room is no longer available. Don't you have something to accommodate me ? - An armchair, a chair? - I am terribly sorry, sir. - I can only offer you a couch. - Very good. - Perfect. - What a couch! He'll sleep in the room with me. No, no, let it be. If the young lady agrees. No bother, I have a big bed, We will not bother each other. No, no, no, The couch is fine with me. No, no way, he sleeps in the room with me. (Armando) Ah. If the young lady agrees, I would take advantage of it. - Well. - Do you have any identification? - Yes. - Thank you. - I have my passport. - Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. Excuse me, do you realise what you say and what you do? - I always know what I am doing. - Yes ? Yes, what? No, I'm fine now. (Armando) I have a warm bed, a warm quilt, I'm really comfortable. Are you going to Africa with the Red Cross? No, no, give up, look. No, it's fine, we'll talk about it, I'll be home for breakfast tomorrow anyway. Is that alright? Bye, Alessandra, good night. Good night, dear. - Thank you, Federica. - You're welcome. Why is your wife going to Africa? Ah, she has been involved in aid to the Third World, for the Red Cross. How come you didn't tell her that you were in the room with me? Well, these things you don't say over the phone, because it can be misunderstood. you're is right. - Are you comfortable in the bed? - Ah. - How grateful I am to you! - Are you sure you're alright? I heard you say that your head was cold. Well, because there was so much rain today! My head is freezing. Look under the pillow. - Under the pillow ? - Yes. What ? Oh there. - What a beautiful nightcap ! - Do you like it ? Beautiful, is it yours ? No, it was a surprise for my fianc?. - Ah- - But you can wear it now. Eh, no, that's not proper. What do you care? Put it on, he didn't come anyway. - Really? - Yes. Well, you know what ? I feel sorry for your fianc?, I'm really going to wear it. - Ahh ! - It looks great on you. - Do I look good? - Yes. - It looks really good on you. - Nice, warm. Well, it suits you just fine, but you're fine with everything. You'll wear it with a lot of distinction. - Really ? - Yes. You have beautiful blue eyes. I hadn't noticed. Actually, I hadn't noticed it either. Oh, God, it's already 11 p.m. and the lights still haven't come back on. Yeah, and we can't watch the television either. That's better, so we can talk a little. Yes, it's better, but I was saying that because TV helps me sleep. Every time I see television I fall asleep. Can't sleep ? Yes, yes, I sleep well, all right. Would you like me to read you a good poem? - Ah, poetry ? - YES. - I like poems so much, I love them. - I always read them in the hospital to patients. They are as happy as children. - Yes, really ? - Yes, they like it. - Ah, read it to me, what is it ? - Do you like Pr?vert ? Pr?vert is my favourite author, his love poems are exquisite. (Armando) A beautiful poem, what a beautiful idea! - "When." - "When." "When the little lion has breakfast, the lioness becomes young again." "When fire claims its share, the earth blazes." "When death speaks to her of love, life quivers." "When life speaks to it of death, love has a smile." What is he doing, sleeping ? - Need anything else? - No, thank you very much. Federica, breakfast has arrived. - Finished showering? - (Federica) I'll be right there. - Please, have a seat. - Thank you. - Oh, sorry. - Oh, you're welcome. - Did you make a mistake? - Did I make a mistake? You made a mistake, this is my room. Isn't this room 223 ? Yes, it's 223. - This is not the one you were looking for. - How is it not mine? I booked this room in my fianc?e's name, Ms. Federica Pescatore. Do you know you are right ? This is the room Of Ms. Federica Pescatore. So what are you doing here? What am I doing here? Yes, what are you doing here? No, I am not doing anything here. It is as if I were not here. It's a pure coincidence, that I am here. - (Federica) Engineer, who are you talking to? - To your fianc?. Ah. Um. Hi, weren't you supposed to arrive in the afternoon ? Never mind when I was supposed to arrive. Rather you, explain to me what you are doing in bed with this gentleman. I mean, you arrive so suddenly and you raise your voice? Do you want to make out that it's my fault too now ? (Armando) Listen, sir, don't get any wrong ideas, because I could also sleep In an armchair. It was the generosity of the young lady who told me: "No, you sleep in my bed", but that was because it was me. Excuse me, take a good look at my face. I am closer to 80 than 70. What does it matter, what are you saying ? What does age matter? Look, Miss Federica, perhaps you can better explain to the gentleman how things went. That's it, anyway, now I'll get dressed right away. Don't worry, and then I'll also leave in a flash Here, I'll get my briefcase. Pardon. You must tell me who it is! But who is this? Meanwhile, this is a gentleman. In fact, he is a great gentleman. If you really want to know, Is a famous engineer. He is a designer of steam locomotives. Here I am. I was very fast. I want to take my troubles from you. To you, young lady, I want to express all my gratitude for your generous hospitality. Sorry to have disturbed you. What disturbance, engineer ? It was a great pleasure. - (Federica) Aren't you going to answer? - (Giorgio) Do I have to answer as well? (Giorgio) Federica, I am used to the fact that you are unpredictable. (Federica) This is the way I am, take it or leave it. (Federica) Leave me ! La 231, accompany the gentlemen to the room. This is perfectly fine. - Oh, good morning, sir. - Good morning. Did you sleep well? Well, never mind, let's say I slept. Rather, how much do I owe you for the room ? Nothing, sir, you are a guest of the young lady. - Yes? - It's all on the boyfriend's account. - Really ? - Eh- Ah, well. - So. - here is your passport. Thank you, this is for you. - Thank you, sir, have a good trip. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, sir. Let's all hope for the best. Hopefully. - (Hotelier) Hotel Orologio. - Listen, porter. I am that gentleman who stayed overnight in your hotel in the room of Miss Federica Pescatore. Yes, sir, did you forget something ? No, I wanted information. After my departure what happened ? All quiet, sir, don't worry. Ah. Do you already know Miss Pescatore? Is she a client of yours ? No, it was the first time she was sleeping over. Ah. Um, tell me, concierge, in confidence, her behaviour don't you find it a bit equivocal? You should know better, sir. No, because my suspicions are... This sudden arrival of the boyfriend, you know, I wouldn't want them to disagree. Did they try to extort you? No, no. Not exactly extortion, but if the young lady asks her for my address, you say that you are not authorised to give it to her. - All right, sir. - All right. I thank you for your generous tip. - Have a good trip. - Not at all, thank you. Take care, eh. Heh, oh. That... Some intention was there. - Thank you. - Welcome back, engineer. (Armando) Here. - Here. - Thank you. - Yesterday we waited for you all evening. - I know, I had to stay. - My wife? - And upstairs, she's working with the Countess. Erm, the little crusaders and the black gentleman, as usual. - (Luisita) Good morning, engineer. - Hello, Luisita, everything OK here? Here is the Italian Red Cross in action. - How are you doing ? - Good, thank you. - Oh, John. - Good morning, engineer. Sorry we invaded your house today. - We had an expedition. - For goodness sake, it is your job. Do your work, where is my wife ? - She's over there with the Countess. - Good. Hey there, guess what ? It's me, here I am ! - No one can understand... - Alessandra, I'm back. An incredible journey, an adventure I must tell you about. - AFTER- - After ? - I finish the call and I'm all yours. - After that, do whatever you want. - Hello? Hello? - Go, dear. (Alessandra) Consul ? (Armando) Here we go. - Everything done ? - Excuse us, engineer. Make yourselves at home, for goodness sake. - (Armando) By now. - Engineer, lunch is ready. I'm really hungry, but the lady hasn't finished yet. Now, in a little while... I was expecting it yesterday And instead it only arrived this morning. He says he has so much to tell me, Who knows what it will be ? - (Contessa) Everything is ready here. - Goodbye. - Hello. - Hello. Luisita ? - (John) Ma'am. - Yes ? I'll pick you up tomorrow with the Consulate's car. (Alessandra) Perfect. - The engineer is waiting for you. - Luisita, accompany the gentlemen. Armando ? (Armando) I couldn't wait. to return home to tell you about this adventure, it's an incredible thing! At the station she calls me: " Papa." Inside the train she enters my private suite, giving up the company of basketball players, oh! She says: "But they are boring, I prefer to be with you." Tell me, but what is she like? What is she like? Ah, she's beautiful. She is very beautiful. She works as a nurse at the Hospital of the Holy Spirit. She says she is enrolled at the university, but I think this girl to supplement her salary... Ah, but then this is a long story. - Very long. - It feels like an adventure novel. Let's go over there and have a drink, come on. While you finish telling me, I'm waiting for the phone call. I couldn't wait to come back to tell you about it. More than just long! Just listen. During the whole journey back, I said: " Now that I'm going to tell Alessandra..." - "Love, can I have my usual drink? - Yes. This happened because I was forced to stay in Bologna. - Yeah. - There was the storm, there was the strike. I looked for a room. All the hotels were full, there was not a single vacant room. I found one from a French dentist. If they didn't come, they'd give it to me. Instead, at that moment at the most beautiful the French dentist arrived. The director came to me and said: "Look, the room is occupied." "I can give you a couch." "A couch ?" she said, "Are you crazy ?" "He's sleeping with me." Well, she was very nice this girl. Yes, yes, she was very nice. But did you understand what I told you ? Of course I understood. Well, I slept with her, I slept the whole night with her. Armando, I understand. - I got it ! - As long as you understand. Eh, I didn't even want to tell you. I said: "Alessandra is going to get jealous." - My love... - No, eh ? - Jealousy ? - No. After so many years I know you too well. So, listen, right now I really have some very big worries to think about. So excuse me. - Look, I put on my pyjamas.... - Shh. (Armando) Ah... Hello ? Oh, it's you at last. I've been waiting for hours for you. Yes. I wanted to tell you that I checked the whole list of antibiotics. They're all expired. A disgrace, believe me, a great shame! - (Armando) Alessandra, Alessandra ? - No, no. (Alessandra) For the rest we are quite covered, I mean, the other medicines are there. It is late, I almost. - (Alessandra) Hmm. - Huh ? - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes, No, for the medicines... If not let's make it daytime, I know these phone calls. I received a fax from Milan which I will now read it to you. You guarantee us the sending of the following vaccines. - Just a moment. - YES. So. I'm going to the bedroom, it's not over yet, you'll see. "Cholera, malaria, typhoid..." (Armando) No, on that side there no temptation. (Priest) Not even with the thought? Eh, with the thought, you know. Because it's so sudden, perhaps driven more by curiosity than anything else, that is. After all, it's been so long that I no longer have any stimuli, I have no reactions. Not even with my wife. So much so That we sleep in separate rooms. - Meanwhile, this is not your wife. - Eh- Did you ever meet that girl again? No, no. You see, it doesn't seem to me that your adventure contains anything shameful. I am rather concerned that you still think about it, huh? You may go. (Priest) Should you find yourself again in similar situations again, always think of your wife. - Do not doubt, Father. - Praised be Jesus Christ. Behold, praise be to jesus. All right, Velardi, now I'll tell you everything. - In the meantime, have a drink. - No, I'll help myself. I want plenty of vodka. Do you think so ? Have you heard from our doctor ? He serves himself. We forbid everything; he eats instead, He drinks and smokes like a Turk. I am a doctor, not a sick person. - Am I right, Mary? - How clever. - Is there a tournament ? - Eh, yes. - Hello? Yes, he's here. - He has not told you. I'll put him on right away. Engineer, it's for you. - Who is ? - Ms. Federica. Another one like that, though... - It's Federica, what shall I tell her? - Well? - Tell her I'm not here. - I said you're here. - What are you afraid of? - Eh! - Answer. - Come on. - Hello ? - It's Federica. Ah, Miss Federica. I thought you wouldn't be in touch any more, it's been a while. How come? You found me, huh? - I found you. - Yes. - What are you doing, engineer? - What am I doing? Well, I'm at home with friends. - You? - What floor do you live on? I live on the first floor, why? Ah, yes, I can see the lights in the windows. - Yes ? - Yes,. What, you see the windows? Why, where are you calling from? I'm down here, in front of your house. - Alessandra, she's down below. - then have her come up. - What, have her come up here? - Eh. But no! (Armando) Excuse me, Miss, why are you calling me from down there? I'm just passing by. I'm on my way to the hospital for the night shift. Ah, well, then good work and thanks for the call. Goodbye, Miss. No, wait a minute. I am free tomorrow, we could meet up. Tomorrow? Look, Miss, I have a lot to do. Why do I have to see you? - I have something very important to tell you. - I cannot come. - Armando, Armando. - What is it? Don't make it so long, give her an appointment, no? Hmm. Miss, if this is very important, OK, let's meet. Where can we meet ? Come tomorrow to my house at three o'clock. Ring the intercom, Via degli Ausoni, 7. But is it your name on the intercom? No, it says: "Tango School." - School of...? - Tango. - Tango ? - Yes. (Armando) What is it? Don't ask too many questions, I will explain tomorrow. All right, Miss, at 3 o'clock I'll be at your house. Goodbye. Goodbye. "Tango school," she says. Crazy things. Does it seem to you that a man of my age goes to tango school? Here. (Armando) "Tango School." She said, "You ring the intercom, but no one answering. What is this, a freight elevator? (Armando) Oh, here we go. - Hello. - Good morning. Good morning. Does Miss Federica live here? Yes, are you Federica's pap? ? No, I am not her pap?. - I am Engineer Andreoli. - The engineer. - Come in. - Oh, thank you. - What a pleasure. - (Armando) Yes. - (Armando) Federica is always talking about you. - Really? Where is Federica ? She just woke up because she did night shift at the hospital. - Ah. - Vega, come in, give me your coat. No, no, I'd rather keep it. "One, two, three" Excuse me, does Federica sleep here in the tango school? Yes, we sleep upstairs. We share the flat with three girls to save on rent. This is Mercedes, she's from Argentina, she gives tango lessons here. Bend your knee, you have to feel my body, that's good. Mercedes, the engineer has arrived. Oh, engineer, finally. Good morning, engineer. - Pleased to meet you. - Please, have a seat. - Thank you. - (Mercedes) Here, pay no attention to it. (Armando) No, I'm waiting for Federica. No, it is broken. - No, it's fine. - Gloria, take that chair away. - I'm so sorry. - She told me that later. - You're right. - Sit here, so sorry. It is nothing, nothing at all. Like this. - (Mercedes) Do you like tango ? - (Armando) Do I like it ? I'll tell you, back in the day, in all modesty I was a great dancer. Today, you know, they don't do such dances any more. Today they are dancing to rock. - Yes, it's true, young people are dancing to rock. - "What the hell!" Not doing exercise anymore, venting their emotions by jumping around, moving to the rhythm of rock. - Unfortunately. - But nothing to do with tango. - Rock is puritanical. - Puritanical, why? Because the man and the woman they dance separately. - Oh, yeah. - Tango is much more sensual. Yep. I don't quite grasp the concept, what do you mean? I mean that in the tango there is physical contact, the man and the woman always remain close. (Mercedes) He feels her body, she feels his body. (Mercedes) It is a carnal relationship. She teaches him that sensual love and death always go together. Ah. Sorry, but I had never made any of those thoughts. I'm saying this against my own interests, though. Sensuality cannot be learned in school. - One has to be born with this gift. - Not that one. - Like Federica, for example. - Why does Federica also...? Yes, she helps me when she can, she pairs up with my students. - You should see her. - I can imagine. - No, you can't imagine it. - Of course not! There she is. - There he is. - Oh there. Federica, look who's here ? Sorry to keep you waiting. Federica, I'll give you back your engineer, he is very nice. - I know. Good morning, engineer. - Good morning, Federica. - Show him how you dance the tango. - No, another day. - We don't have time today, do we? - No ? - "Adios." - "Adios, Senorita ." Where are we going ? We can stay here, so we can dance the tango. - No, let's go somewhere quieter. - Yes? We must be alone, I have something very important to tell you. He told me: "If you have been all night in bed together" "and he didn't try, then your engineer is an asshole." No, "asshole" ? Now let's take it easy. Let's just say I'm a decent person. You can see that for him makes no difference. Of course, he is young. Some young people talk like that, but when they have reached my age then they will understand. But no! He says in these cases age has nothing to do with it. I agree with him. Excuse me? And you agree with him? Yes, if you let me talk, I want to explain to you that age is an irrelevant factor in romantic relationships. But how is it irrelevant? Come on, now! You're telling me ? To a man of my experience ? But if you always interrupt me ! Am I interrupting you? You're interrupting me, sorry. Instead you have to listen to me because you don't understand. - I don't know what? - you don't know. He doesn't know that if a man my age, suppose he is in bed with a woman, also the most beautiful in the world, the most attractive, the most exciting, he lets her go because he is afraid to attempt the encounter, because he understands that she has her own troubles. Did you or did you not understand what I mean? - I understand, I understand. - Oh! I'm not dumb ! - Then why do you say it's not true? - Well, my fianc? didn't believe it. He made a scene And screwed up the wedding. - Oh, really? - Yes, really. Do you understand why I wanted to see you urgently ? Yes, I understand, it's serious. But. Excuse me, Miss, why did you have to say it so urgently me? Who was I supposed to tell ? Who was there that morning in bed with me? Miss, you wouldn't happen to be you and your fianc? did you and your boyfriend agree that maybe by imagining that I took advantage of you? Or by accusing me of being responsible for this drama ? My fianc? and I agree? But for what reason ? Well, don't tell me. The reasons could be many. The need for money, for example. What would I know? You could ask me for a loan or even damages. It is you and your fianc? who have to tell me what you want from me. What do you want ? You may have great experience, but you haven't understood a thing. Oh, no? Then you explain to me what I didn't understand, please - There is little to explain. - Yes? I was tired of my boyfriend and I'm happy that it all went wrong. Well, but then at this point I breathe a sigh of relief. Oh there, look at that pizzone! Thank you. And what do you plan to do now ? - Now I am finally free. - Well ? - We could be together every day. - What's the point? Listen, engineer, but when I speak you don't understand or do you pretend not to understand? I still don't understand for what reason you and I have to see each other. (Federica) No reason, if there is harmony between us and a relationship is born... (Armando) What harmony, what relationship? Will you explain it to me? (Federica) There's nothing to explain, if two people want to see each other, they see each other. (Armando) How, do they see each other? Excuse me. Why do you want to see me? Who am I to you? - (Alessandra) Armando ! - Alessandra. Who are you quarrelling with? No, Miss Federica accompanied me in the car. Don't just stand there on the street, bring it up. But. yes, only a couple of minutes because I have the night shift. - What are you doing? - Yes, let's go, come on. - Let's go. - Eh, slowly. Good evening, Federica. Good evening, madam. - Welcome. - Thank you. We've already met over the phone. Yes, I know, dear, but it's good to see you and to finally meet you in person, then I didn't know you were so beautiful. Thank you. What a beautiful house, beautiful ! - Who knows how much you pay in rent. - No, no rent. The house is my wife's. You see, my pap? gave it to us when we got married. - Yes. - Come, come. - Sit there. - Thank you. - Have a drink. - Thank you. She has to go to the hospital. - She's on the night shift. - That's right, I'm already late. - Eh. - But why ? - She's just arrived and you take her away from me ? - I know. - Duty calls me. - Listen. But you have to promise me to come back really soon. Certainly, madam. I hope you don't mind if I steal your husband from you sometime. - Here he is. - You're welcome. In fact, I have so little time to devote to him, poor love. I'm always caught up by all these duties of mine. I know, it is very noble what you do for Third World hunger. Please, there is nothing noble in what I do. You see, Federica, I've had the good luck, or the bad luck, to be born into a very rich family. Then I look for everything To make it up to me. That's it, kiss. - Bye. - Bye, thank you. Bye. - Good luck. - Bye, Armando. See you. - (Federica) Goodbye. - Bye. Did you hear that? "Bye, Armando, see you." Well, what are you looking for? Women today are like that, aren't they ? - Well, but I am surprised. - But don't be so jurassic ! Instead, listen, late as it is, where have you been? Give me your hand. - Hand in hand. - But why? - Like children, in the park chatting. - Oh, too cute. Then she offered me a pizza which stuck in my stomach. Pizza? Poor love! Come, I'll make you some chamomile tea. The staff are finished, but I'll gladly make it for you. (Armando) Thank you. Now that you have met her, you have seen her properly, what do you think, Alessandra, of her? - What impression did she make on you? - What impression did she make on me? She is really beautiful. Perhaps, you know, she's a little bit strange for my taste, but with that body... She is also honest in appearance. On the other hand, she is a nurse, and works all night to earn a living. She says she's a nurse, but what do we know about who she really is? Oh, look, Armando, you have such suspicions, you are adult enough to know what to do, aren't you? - You ask for information. - Yeah. Look, wait for me, huh. - Good morning, are you a relative of the injured person? - No, I don't know him. - I was asking about a nurse. - Ask Sister Costanza. - Bottom right. - Bottom right ? - (Armando) Sister Costanza? - Yes. - Excuse me, Sister. - Are you visiting someone? No, no, I came here to do some research, but as I am here in the hospital, I wanted to ask about a nurse. - Which nurse ? - Her name is Federica Pescatore. I'm not sure, but they told me she works here. Yes, Federica Pescatore works here, she works the night shift. - This morning she left at 8 o'clock. - Then it's true that she works here. - Of course. - Ah, good. - Excuse me, who are you? - Um, I'm a relative. I have known Federica since birth. Do you know that everyone in the town talks about her? She has a great passion for medicine. Yes, and now, being here in the hospital, how does the young lady conduct herself? - She is the pillar of this ward. - Ah. She works at night to earn more money, but the truth is that she's in love with these old gentlemen. - You know what I mean. - Yes. - They want my blood, Sister Costanza. - Do you hear? Do you hear? They want to take away my blood, But I am afraid. - If Federica doesn't come, I won't do it. - Do you hear that? - All right, she's coming tonight and I'll take it from you. - Thank you. Here, everyone is so fond of her. After all, she does some really... She washes them, she shaves them, she takes them to the bathroom. - I don't tell her ! - And nice what I hear. Yes. - It's rare for a young person as beautiful as her. - Yes. Well, actually, it is a bit strange, because she's so beautiful and young! I ask her: "How do you spend your nights with these old gentlemen" "instead of going out and having fun ?" Yes, that's what I thought too, but for such a young lady, beautiful and stunning, isn't that very strange behaviour ? Yes, indeed it is a bit strange, but which one of us doesn't have oddities? - Don't we? - Allow me, sister. - For the little chapel, some flowers. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you, that was very kind. - Thank you, thank you. - (Armando) Duke ? - (Duke) Yes, engineer. Juraschi, take into account Of the axial stress, Between the rim and the rail. He will see what he combines next. - Yes. - Hello, Research. (Luciani) Yes, he is here, good. - Ah, Luciani ? - (Lucians) Yes ? Call a taxi, I'm going home. Miss Federica is downstairs, she came to pick you up. - (Armando) Really? - (Lucians) Yes. (Armando) Federica ? "Who is she? She is a niece of mine, on my wife's side. "Who is that?" - Congratulations, engineer. - " Why do you care? Federica. Armando. Why the surprise ? Today is a special day. I have a little present for you, for your birthday. No, no, Federica, you don't have to do these things. Come on, don't do these things. For Saint Armando you got me a beautiful pen. What should I do in return? Come have lunch with me. It is I who should be delighted to invite you to lunch, but sadly, you know, my wife. Not at all, today is a special day. She cooked a turkey, and a cake with candles... - Invite her as well. - Champagne... Oh right, we'll ask her. - (Luisita) Hello, Andreoli residence. - Yes, it's me, is my wife in? No, she's having lunch at the Embassy, she told me not to wait for her. Then don't set the table because I'm dining out too. - YES. - Let's have lunch together. Then come with me. - Let's have lunch together. - Yes, I'll go with you. - (Federica) Run. - Don't run, don't run. But blessed child. I am so happy to be with you all day! Me too, but I don't know what happened. You see, my wife, because of her job, she has to make sacrifices, some renunciations. She has great obligations, but all for human welfare. That's very impressive. - When does she leave for Africa? - I don't know, she needs to know today. Do you mind if she leaves ? Do I mind ? I'm alone, so what am I doing in the house alone ? You're there. Yes, dear, I am there, but that is something else. Forty years of marriage, that's no joke. Why, sorry, is our relationship a joke? No, now all jokes aside, where are we going to eat ? Here we are. (Armando) Ah, Santa Maria in Trastevere. Did you choose the 'restaurant'? (Federica) Yes. I know this restaurant. - How come you chose this one? - And a surprise, come on, Armando. - If you please, you are our guest. - Guest of whom? - Who are they? - They are my parents, Papa and Mama. Papa and Mama ? Where ? Federica, Federica ? (Federica) Mamma, pap?. " Papa- - Hi. - " Mama, pap?, look who's here. - Good morning. How do you do, my pleasure. - Delighted. - I am engineer Armando Andreoli. - Sit down, Armando. - Yes. We know who you are. Every time she phones home, Federica tells me a lot about you. Oh really? I didn't know. With Federica there are always surprises. You see, I wasn't supposed to be here today, but at my home. Today is his birthday, but he has made himself available and spending time with us. Well, then you stay for lunch with us and all the best! I'm turning 55 on Monday. Well, time passes for everyone, madam, but you look so young. Well, she looks very good, too, however. Are you passing through Rome? Yes, we came to buy a second-hand car. In fact, we just took a little trip just to try it out. But let's be honest, we also came to meet you, you know. Our curiosity was overwhelming. Mamma Well, after what happened in that little hotel in Bologna... - Mamma, don't insist. - No, she must insist. Go ahead, ma'am. See, this is another little surprise. - What did you tell mamma? - (Federica) I didn't tell her anything. I confided with an aunt of mine and she talked. That was wrong, you did wrong. What are you on about, excuse me? About our chance encounter ? We met by chance, a coincidence, a matter of no importance. What are you talking about? (Father) The engineer is right, she's a chatterbox! That's it. She went to talk to relatives, friends and the whole town heard about it. That's it. What has the town come to hear? Eh, that the fianc? has left her, that the marriage is no longer taking place, now Federica is dating someone else, and she has this new relationship with an engineer. Is the engineer me? - (Armando) Ah, that's it. - (Federica) Yes. Look, the report that Federica says is nonsense. - Thank you. - And it's all made up, it's incredible. Engineer, I am a modest clerk, but I'm very open-minded. In my daughter's personal affairs I don't want to get involved in them. She is a daughter who has always given us so many concerns. - What concerns, mama? - So much, ever since she was a child. She had typhus, didn't want to take Communion, a very different girl from all the rest. She doesn't listen to anyone and we now dare not oppose her. She always does everything on her own. Also this relationship with her, we have to know more about you. I don't know, if it's serious, if you're thinking about an engagement. I don't know. Federica, did you hear what your pap? said? yes, no, pap?, for the time being the engineer and I will see each other. (Federica) We have a beautiful relationship, and we're going out together. In the future, maybe, who knows? In the future, maybe, who knows? That's right, precisely what ? What is certain? Papa, nothing is certain. Eh. (Federica) For the moment we see each other for now. In the future, maybe we will get engaged. Oh, my goodness! Engineer, are you not feeling well ? - (Father) How are you, engineer? - Huh? - (Father) How are you? - I am perfectly fine. Only I was thinking that I have to leave. No. - (Armando) Yes, I have to go. - But Armando? Eh, yes, I have to go. I can't stay, I told you. - I shouldn't be here. - Armando? No, no, you sit here and stay with pap? and mamma. We said what we had to say to each other, We have said it. I thank you for your invitation, you have been very kind. Excuse me, but I really really have to go. - Armando ? - (Armando) I have to go, I'm leaving. Papa, mamma, eat. Nothing happened; that's just the way he is. Sorry. I have never been so ashamed, not even when I was in school. Armando, stop. - Armando, please stop. - Yes, yes, yes, I will stop. I really want to hear what you want, so what do you want? I know, I was wrong, but let me explain. But what do you want to explain ? There is nothing to explain, it's all clear. You hooked me on the train, then you had me found by your boyfriend in bed with you. Today at the restaurant with Papa and Mama, can you believe it? - What are these plots, these deceptions? - No plot. I did it to make peace with my parents. Ah, so you make them feel at ease ? By saying I'm the boyfriend ? Me, at my age ? They live in a small village, they are simple people. You cannot understand what kind of relationship there is between us. But enough ! What relationship? There is no relationship. You must leave, you must disappear. - Do you understand? - Is this the love you want for me? Who told you that I love you ? These are all things you put in your mind. You made them up out of your own imagination. All right, if you deny it, then explain to me why when we are together we love each other so much. Do we love each other when we're together? But if we always quarrel! No, no, no ! Enough, enough!" - What, enough ? - Yes, enough, enough. I am not an asshole as your fianc? says, I say, " Leave and don't let me see you again." Oh, if you come after me again or call me, I'll call the police. - Understand ? - Armando. - Armando, come here. - Taxi, taxi. (Armando) Come on. - (Federica) Armando. - Go away ! Armando ! Armando ! Coward ! Scoundrel ! May lightning strike you down ! Luisita, put things down here and here. - Yes, ma'am. - Alessandra. Hey, Armando. - "Hey, Armando." - Hello. So ? - Have you decided ? - Yes, I decided. - I leave tomorrow morning at 11 a.m. - Why ? Well, you know, there's the hospital to reorganise, I just couldn't get out of it. What about me? Are you leaving me alone ? But darling, with all the love I have for you, however, I too am entitled to my space. - Yes. - Do you think so ? - Besides, you have yours too. - Hmm. - (Alessandra) Luisita, then? - spaces. - (Alessandra) Did you put the lingerie away? - Yes, madam. Take care, don't make me worry. - You already know, don't worry. - Cholera and malaria. Cell phone. - Is it mine ? - Yes. - Yes, Engineer Andreoli, who is it? - I'm leaving. - The plane is leaving. - Federica? - You make the call, OK? - Tell you what. - I'm coming. - I'm glad you phoned me. We broke up arguing and I take this opportunity to tell you that I'm sorry. (Countess) Look. (Armando) I want to be at peace with you, even if we won't see each other again. (Federica) I called you about this, that's why, give me one more chance. - I would like to invite you tonight to a party. - Why? So I tell you that we won't see each other again and you invite me to a party ? Don't get angry now, do you remember my friend Mercedes? What kind of party is this? It's for charity, for Mercedes and her family. If you come to the party, Armando, you will get a free membership to the tango school. (Armando) I don't want any membership ! I'm not coming to the party. - Will you listen to me ? - No! I no longer want to be involved in your affairs. - Who wants to involve you? - Don't raise your voice to me, you know ! Come on, Armando, don't start fighting right now. - I'm about to take off. - Go, darling. Bye, darling, don't be mad, eh. - Yes, love. - Bye-bye. - (Alessandra) Bye. - Bye, love. - (Federica) To whom did you say: "Love?" - Hi. Ah ! Why do you care ? I told my wife she's leaving for Africa. So I'll see you tonight and we will dance together a tango you'll never forget. No, I don't tango with anyone. Goodbye forever. Bon voyage, love. Bye, Armando. Come back soon. Oh, ouch. What a kick ! Ah, another one ? - Are you kicking me ? - Yes. beautiful, isn't it ? That's it, eh. (Armando) Oh there, there. (Armando) I love it, I love you. beautiful Completely black. So beautiful! Federica, he called on the intercom, your fianc? is on his way up. Who ? - Your fianc?? - I don't know anything about it. - I swear. - But how? - You called him. - (Federica) No, I swear. - You made an arrangement. - (Federica) That's not true. Armando, come here, I didn't know. Where did this happen to you ? Eh, from Federica, at the tango school. It was a sudden thing. It's as if the blood boiling in your head. It's terrible, I didn't sleep all night. I had palpitations, I couldn't breathe. Of course, you've got yourself in a state of excitement, friend. I had strong feelings which were a long time ago so many years since I had felt them. Hmm. - Why didn't you take advantage of it right away? - The fianc? had arrived. Fuck, what's the fiance got to do with it? Exactly, that's where you had to end it. I don't know why. - Actually... - (Velardi) What are you doing, crying? Yes, I'm sick. Oh, you haven't fallen in love, have you ? oh. Who is speaking ? Tell the Minister that the engineer is very sorry, and he is in bed with a fever, he cannot come. No. Oh. Sorry, engineer, you haven't eaten since yesterday, at least have some tea with biscuits. Luisita I, I'm breathing heavily and drinking tea ? I don't want anything, go away. Leave me alone. Since. Hello ? Ah, Miss Federica. No, the engineer is not here. No ? And who am I ? Give me the phone. "She's not here." Hello, Federica ? That asshole left again, when shall we meet? Has the asshole left ? I'm coming tonight, let's dance the tango. No, tonight there are too many people. Let's meet at breakfast time and we'll be alone. - Alone ? - YES. - My friends are not here until this evening. Let's eat something here, I want to be alone with you for a while. I too need so much to be alone with you. Come soon, I'll be waiting for you. - Come. - Of course, I'm coming, yes. Luisita, draw me a hot bath. Lily foam, scent of Arp?ge. - Throw in a couple of rose petals. - Whatever you want, engineer. - Yes. - Have some tea. Tea? The tango! I am so happy ! Go and prepare my bath. Oh there, hooray! Oh, my, my! - What, are you impressed ? - Yes. Tango ! Armando mio, hold me tight. Yes, my love. Yes, I'll hold you, my beloved, I've come just to hold you. Papa, Papa! (Armando) (Just call me pap?.) (Federica) My daddy isn't here anymore, my pap? has died! - What, pap? died? - (Federica) Yes. When ? He died yesterday, they phoned me half an hour ago. I have to go, they're taking him away, I have to go! Now that he is dead, you have become my pap?. Yes. (Armando) Uh, another flight of stairs. - (Priest) Excuse me. - Who is it? Ah, please. You are welcome. What a disgrace. Are they taking him away soon ? Yes, engineer, they are taking him away. - (Woman) Yes, yes, they'll take him away. - (Woman 2) Yes, engineer. Armando, Armando. - (together) Engineer, they're calling you. - What? - (Woman) They are calling you. - Armando, what are you doing there? Come up. Shall I come up? Coming up. Here comes Papa. Papa. Papa, look who's here. Armando, aren't you going to say hello to my pap?? - (Mother) Engineer? - Who is she? Ah, madam. - Did you see that misfortune? - How did it happen? How should I know? We were over there, he was fine. - He was fine and suddenly... - I feel awful! - I feel awful! - What is it? Come on, Armando, they're taking Papa away. Let's go now. Let's go, let's go. My daughter is left alone, engineer. Take care, love her very, very much. Now that pap? is gone, when are you planning to get married? - Well... - We'll get married as soon as the mourning is over. - What mourning, what mourning ? Get married right away. - It's not up to me. - With whomever? Aren't you the man? - Yes, madam. Ma'am? Call me aunt and give me a kiss. - Don't you ? - We're going now, aunt. - That's it, yes. - Bye. - We have to go. - Bye, love. - Bye. - Bye. - Take care. - Take it easy. (Mother) Bye. (Woman) Listen, but your daughter where did she find this engineer? (Woman 2) But he seems like a good Christian, your daughter has settled down, what more do you want ? Goodbye, Armando, goodbye. What do we do now? Don't we eat today? Thank you, Armando. - And what? - Of everything, I feel happy next to you. Listen, Federica. Now that you have calmed down from this great pain of yours, and we are about to consummate this wonderful night of love, please for the future, do not spoil this imminent pleasure of being together By saying meaningless things - Why, what did I say? - You mentioned marriage. I understand, Federica, That you said that To reassure your mother and relatives, but you shouldn't say these things. You shouldn't say even in jest But I wasn't joking, I really want to marry you. There, do you see ! Do you see that you are talking without thinking ? I have been married for more than 40 years, I'm getting married ? I know. you desire me now and tonight you want to be with me. Yes, beloved. I yearn for you. I look forward to this night to be with you, But I am still married. Who cares? We'll run away. We'll run away? Where do do we run to? There, you see that ? Do you see the nonsense you talk ? What nonsense ? You can everything. Go to the bank, take all the money you have, then sell your property and move far away from here, On a desert island in the Caribbean. That's it, yeah. I take all the money in the bank, I sell my properties And we are going to live in the Caribbean. - Yes. - Ol?. Eh, good, good. And then ? Then you file for divorce and we get married. So you put poison in my coffee And you become the owner of everything. Did you plan this you and your fianc? ? Ah, is that what you think of me ? That I want to put poison in your coffee? Listen, dear. I have tried with all my might to banish this ghost, but I was unable to do so. I have been wary from the very first moment. You said it today. It is my heritage that you are interested in. You never cared about me at all ! - Ah, that's right. - YES. Where are you going ? Listen, you old hypocrite. Because you are stubborn And I can't make you understand That I am sincere, I'll tell you just one thing. - Take it or leave it. - Leave. What? Leave ! Then go away, go away ! Leave, leave, I never want to see you again ! Get out ! Leave, leave, go away ! - Oh, Oh ! - Go away ! Damned be the day on which I met you ! - Oh! - Oh. - Is this going to Rome ? - Yes. Please open. - Excuse me, commander. - Yes. Has the private plane from Mozambique arrived? - That's us, we've just arrived. - Armando, Armando. - Alessandra. - Love. I'm back. So are all the problems solved there? All resolved. Any help is a drop in the ocean. If you only knew what pain, what immense pain, with all these human skeletons asking for help. Look, a real shame for the so-called civilised world. Then, my love, I want to tell you something. Listen, I want to confess this to you. I didn't tell you from afar because I didn't want you to worry. You see, when I saw the fever continuing to rise, and I found myself in the presence of death, in a solitude very extreme, very painful loneliness, then, I understood then, Armando, That the only thing in the world, that is really important to me, is you. Love. Love. No. No. No. No. It's not my fault. No. No. It is not my fault. Then you have fallen in love with her. God, God (Mercedes) (Do you like tango ?) (Because the man and the woman dance separately). (The tango is much more sensual, I mean...) - (Federica) Where do we go now ? - (George) In the hotel, at Dad's. He has just arrived from Argentina, he is so anxious to meet you. - Will you accompany me? - You couldn't have a better partner. - Now. - pap? is a great dancer. - Will you accompany me ? - You will arrive together. I will be in the church waiting for you, don't do as you normally do. - Yes, but let's leave right away. - Have you decided where to go? Far away, as far away as possible, where I've always dreamed of going. (Federica) On a desert island in the Caribbean Sea. Hold. - A small coffee, please serve it to me outside. - (Waiter) All right. A ristretto coffee. Thank you. (Woman) She's coming. Alessandra ? Alessandra ? Where are you ? Luisita ? Luisita, but is there no one there ? Where are you ? Luisita ? Why did you prepare only one place setting? - Yes, engineer. - What about my wife ? She has left. - Did she leave? - Yes. She went to Piedmont to her sister. She left you a letter. (Alessandra) (Dear Armando, I left for Turin this morning). (I'm going to my sister's and I'll stay with her I don't know for how long). (In fact, you see, I can't accept the idea) (that you have fallen in love with your young friend,) (I just can't do it). (I need to think and I think you need to as well). (Maybe we'll talk again.) (Sorry. Alessandra.) Engineer, rigatoni all'amatriciana. Amatriciana ? Eh, put. I'm not hungry anyway. But how can I do without her ? (Alessandra) ( That's when, I understood it then, Armando,) (that the only thing in the world,) (which is really important to me, is you). Alessandra. Yes, Andreoli, who is it? (Alessandra) Armando, it's me. Alessandra. Finally. So I'll see you tomorrow morning? Yes, I have already left. I arrive precisely in Turin, and see you at the station. Platform number 7, the Saint Moritz carriage, number 9. Armando, after so long I'm very excited, so you know? And I'm really excited, Alessandra ? Listen, are you still thinking about her? - Who her? - Come on, don't pretend! - You know who I'm talking about. - Alessandra, it's been a long time. The story with that woman ended before your departure. I haven't heard from her since that time. I want to believe you. I love you, Alessandra, I love you. I love you so much too. Goodnight. Good night, dear. - See you tomorrow. - Good night, see you tomorrow. But that was crazy business. "Still thinking about that one ?" Excuse me, thank you. - (Child) Mother. - Engineer. - Who is ? - Giorgio. - The fianc?, remember Federica? - Eh, gosh ! Federica's infamous fianc?, yeah, right. - Where are you going? - To Turin to meet relatives. - Ah, is that your son? - Yes, he's my son. - Eh! - Is Federica in the cabin ? - Federica ? - Eh. That's my wife, she's German. What are you talking about? I was there that morning. She was at the door, Federica arrived in a Rolls-Royce. You entered the church, what happened? True, then once in front of the altar she changed her mind and left. - (Giorgio) She ran away. - She ran away? Yes, she ran away with my pap? to South America. With your pap?? Look, with Federica it's no wonder. The man didn't matter to her. In fact, she preferred your pap?'s money. Your pap? is very rich, isn't he? My pap? rich? He never had a lira. He has done a thousand jobs in life. He has always made do. Do you think he is now an entertainer on a cruise ship in the Caribbean. But what about ? In the Caribbean ? She did it, eh. - Did you see them again? - No. Every now and then they send some postcards, in fact, I should have one here. - It arrived today, here it is. - Oh there. (Armando) Are they on this ship? They dance in pairs. Tango. Goodbye, engineer. - Best wishes. - To you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. (Armando) (Ah, Federica.) (What have you done?)
