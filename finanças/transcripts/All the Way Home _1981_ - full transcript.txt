ANNOUNCER: Tonight, live from the Bing Theater at the University of Southern California, NBC Live Theater presents Tad Mosel's Pulitzer Prize winning play, "All the Way Home." In one moment live, Act One "All the Way Home." And now, live, Act One of "All the Way Home." [laughter] My name is Rufus! Nigger's name, nigger's name, nigger's name! Rufus [inaudible]. [applause] [inaudible] I'm Rufus! We're gonna catch hell! What in the world are you doing, Google-eyes? I wish my name was Google-eyes. Oh no, you don't. Because that's a funny name. You wouldn't wanna be called by a funny name. -Rufus is a funny name. -No, honey. It ain't. It's a nigger's name. No. Look we got a nice clear day for the outing, don't we. And you can see all the way to North Knoxville. And if you squint your eyes, you can see the North Pole. Squint your eyes. See the pole? And see that puff of smoke coming up over the hill? That means there'll be a train along the viaduct any minute now-- the 107. MOTHER: Rufus! Mama's calling me. Let's just watch that train go by. You know, Rufus is a very fine old name, Rufus. Some colored people take it too, but that's perfectly all right and nothing for them to be ashamed of, or for white people to be ashamed of who take it. You were given that name because it was your great-grandfather's Lynch's name, your mama's grandfather. And it's a name to be proud of. you're proud of it, ain't you? Yes, sir. Then, you gotta stand up for it. Can you spell "brave?" B-R-A-V-E. Now "proud?" P-R-O-U-D. That's the one. Just keep spelling that. P-R-O-U-D. -You know what I'm proud of? -Mama? You too. Why, you can read and spell like I couldn't when I was twice your age. I wish you'd be proud of me because I'm brave. One of these days, Ruf, you'll get those boys to shake you by the hand. When a man shakes you by the hand, that means you've won him over. Hold on there. You've only got me by the ends of the fingers. Push your thumb clear up against mine. That's it. Now wrap your fingers as far as you can around the palm of my hand, all the way to the other side if you can. Now, squeeze. Not too hard. That's just bragging. Just enough to show you mean what you're doing! Now, shake. There she goes, right on time. (SINGING): Oh, I hear them trains a-coming, and they're mighty near at hand. I can hear them train cars rumbling, come a-rumbling across the land. Get on board, little children. Get on board, little children. [applause] Little children, get on board. Little children, there is room for many and more. Here comes the 107. Don't you go away, Rufus. Your daddy's people will be here in a minute. Ralph just called up on the telephone. Where from? Well, you know Ralph. He wasn't but 10 blocks away, just downtown. But instead of coming right on, he went to all the trouble of stopping and parking that machine and going in some place to come and say they were almost here. Did you ever know any one get such a kick out of telephones? If you ask me, he was in a saloon. Probably didn't want to use the telephone at all, if you know what I mean. Just use it as an excuse to Sally for stopping. And then once he was in there, he figured he better really call us, because Sally would find out from us that he didn't. And then she'd know that wasn't why he had stopped. [laughter] You sure can complicate a thought, Mama. You know what I mean. Did he say anything about knocking Kaiser Wilhelm's block off? No. Thank goodness. He was very pleasant. Then I reckon we'll still have a nice day. Jay, when they get here, you won't let Ralph influence you, will you? I might just hoist a few with him. -Jay. -Sure. You and the others go on to great-grandma's. I reckon Ralph and I'll stay here and have ourselves a bender. I'm just ripe for it. Don't talk like that, even in fun. Now, Mary, you don't ever worry about me anymore, do you? I just don't like jokes about that particular subject. You know what I don't like-- superintendents. No sir, I don't like people looking down on me, thinking they gotta keep an eye on me. Was I looking down on you? You's about 10 feet off the ground. Honestly, Jay. Two feet. [laughter] Well, shame on me. I certainly do appreciate you pointing it out. (SINGING): I got a gal and a sugar babe too-- That's an awful song, Jay. Don't sing that song. Guess I know how to get on the good side of you, don't I? I guess you do. Jay, Jay, don't. Jay, don't. I certainly do hope the neighbors enjoyed that. Rufus, darling, I just straightened up this room for your daddy's people. Well, they won't be coming in here, Mary. Well, I want them to be able to if they want to, don't I? Rufus'll clean up the mess he made. Won't you, honey? And how about you? Will you clean up that mess you're making with your pipe? Honestly, Jay. Rufus, did you ever think of starting a collection of pipe scrapelings? Scrapelings? Sure, that's what they're called. Really, Jay? You wrap 'em up in a little piece of paper, and you mark 'em with the date and whose pipe they come out of. And you put 'em in some secret hiding place, where no one will ever find 'em. All right, Jay. Oh, please, Mama, may I? Well, of course you may. Just don't spill 'em all over everywhere. And keep your feet off your daddy's chair. Rufus, don't make your mama pick up after you. What is that, honey? -Nothing. I just got a little dizzy. That's all. You sit right down. What's the matter, Mama? You all right now? Yes, of, course. It's just a thing of the minute. It's to be expected from now on. What's the matter? Nothing, darling. Nothing. Mama just stooped over too quickly, made the room go round. That's all. Aw, why don't you tell him, Mary? Jay, please. Tell me what? There, you see? He's gotta find out sometime. Not now. Find out what, mama? See him for himself sooner or later that something's happening. Not if you don't call it to his attention. I'd have told him weeks ago, if you'd have let me. I wanted to talk to Father Jackson first. Aw, you don't need any priest to tell you how to talk to your own boy. Jay, I don't want him asking a Q-U-E-S-T-I-O-N-S. That won't do you any good, mama. He can outspell the both of us put together. Look, Mama. I'm getting dizzy. Look! Rufus, darling, stop that. Come here and sit with your mama. Rufus, after a while you're gonna have a big surprise. Like a present? Oh, something like a present, but very much nicer. What's it gonna be? Well, if I told you that, it wouldn't be a surprise, now would it? Where's it now? Up in heaven, darlin'. It's still up in heaven. Tell him it's right here with us. Right here? Rufus. Rufus, for the next few months, you and I have gotta take special care of Mama. We've gotta treat her like something that might just break. Well, I think we've told him enough for the time being. He knows that there is a surprise coming to us from heaven, and we all have something to look forward to. If we don't tell him all of it, honey, the older boys will on the streets. Would you like that? What do they know? Nothing, darlin'. Nothing at all. Is the surprise a cap? Is that the surprise, mama? Rufus, Rufus, I have told you time and time again-- you can't have one of those cheap, flashy caps. And I want you to stay away from those rowdy boys. What if they won't stay away from him? Darlin', would you do mama a favor? There's a lunch hamper in the kitchen. Would you take it out and put it in the alley so it'll be all ready to put in Uncle Ralph's car when he gets here? Would you do that? Do I have to? Rufus, you do what your mama says. I think it'd make him feel more grown up if he had a cap like the older boys. He's not grown up, Jay. It's kinda hard for a fellow to know where he stands around here. You tell him to stay away from the older boys. I tell him to win 'em over. You say the surprise is up in the sky someplace. I say it's right here on earth. Yes, sir, it sure is hard for a fellow to know what's going on. Well, he's just a child. That about priests and heaven sets my teeth on edge. Jay, sometimes I pray-- That's your privilege. Well, now, I can't say what I was gonna say. I'm listening. Yes, you are, but you're keeping your distance, Jay, the way you always do when these things come up. There's a space about 100 miles between us. You've got that pursed up look, that preachy pursed up look. Jay, when the baby comes there'll be time enough to tell him about it. Sure, Mary. Well, I thought we'd all have something cold to drink before we start out. Dear Lord, in Thy mercy to do all things, please close this gulf between us. Make us one in Thee as we are in earthly wedlock for Jesus' sake, amen. They're here, they're here! They are? Come. Oh, now-- now that's not Ralph's car. That sure is Ralph getting out. Hey there, Ralph! We made it, Jay, safe and sound. Where'd you get the car? [applause] Where'd you get the car? Do you like her? It's a Chalmers, ain't it? It goes like 60, Jay. What are you trying to do? Make me look like a packer? Well, you are a packer, ain't you? You packer. You ride around town in an old Tin Lizzie. Hey, sweetheart. How you been? Just fine, Ralph. I gotta hug you. Uh-oh. I just gotta hug you. Hey, Jay. You can hug Sally. Everybody hugs my wife. Come on. Oh! I thought we'd all have something cold to drink before we start out, Ralph. I do something wrong, Mary? Goodness sakes, no. Why don't you tell everybody to get out of the car, before they suffocate. Hey, everybody, come on! Sally's got something cold waiting. Mary's got something cold waiting for you! That-- that's just like you, Mary. I told 'em riding over. I said, Jay's wife will have something cold waiting. I know that girl. I know what she's like. What's the trouble, honey? What are you crying about? What's the matter, honey? Hey, Jay, you oughtn't call a boy "honey." Go on. Blow. You know your mama don't like you to swallow that stuff. Rufus, darlin', what happened. Reckon it ain't fit for ladies' ears, Mary. Maybe you'd better turn your back. Oh, for goodness sakes. Now, tell Daddy. Is that all? Is that all it is? What is it, Jay? It seems that Rufus here has had a little accident. An accident? Did my Jim Wilson hit him? 'Cause if he did-- No, Ralph. Nothing like that. You know, Mary, an accident. Oh, Rufus, darlin'. You're too old for that. After I got you all dressed up for your daddy's people. Jay, would you help him change? He's old enough to manage by himself. Oh, that kind of accident? It must have been the excitement of the day. That's rich, it is. Rufus is a baby. No, Ralph. Rufus is a baby. Ralph, that'll do! Hey, everybody. Rufus has had an accident. That's how my Chalmers affects people. They take one look at her, and they wet their britches. They pee their pants. Hello, Jay. Sally, how are you? Jay, now get Pa sat down, Jay. He shouldn't be standing around too long. Yes, just make yourself at home. Sally, where you going? Sally, where are you going? I'm taking Jim Wilson to the bathroom so we don't have any more accidents. Well, I'd just like for you to answer me when I ask you a question. Sally, you hear me? I want you to answer my questions. Oh, here, pa. You'd better sit on your tube. Can I get you something cold to drink, Mama Follet? Wait on pa first, if you would, Mary dear. I know how parched he gets. How's your breath, pa? Pretty fair. JAY: You haven't had anymore of your attacks, have you, pa? No, not since that one last fall, Jay. I'll be sure to spoil you, then. When you come close to losing someone, that's the way you do. Some easy life, I'll say. I-- I suppose that Mary spoils you enough. No, Mama Follet. I think Jay spoils me. And so he should, with another baby on the way. It don't show yet, do it, Mary? Well, some shows early and some shows late. Ralph showed almost before I knew he was there. Jay, you was a kicker. Are you all right, pa? I'm doing pretty good. Ralph, are you in there? I'll be right with you, Mary. Would you like some ice cold lemonade? Oh yes, thank you. I'm dry as a bone. Well, things must be pretty good for you, Ralph, if you can afford to go out and buy a new Chalmers. Well, Jay, considering the state the world is in, Ralph Follet's doing fine, just fine. OK, Ma, I borrowed the money. But in this day and age, you've gotta be in a sound financial situation to borrow money. Jay, when I walked into Ed Briggs' office at the bank of La Follette, he said, do you want to buy a car, Ralph? Well, you take what you need. Now, that's how I'm thought of at that bank. I'm suprised he didn't give you the keys to the safe, Ralph. Did you hear what Jay said? Well, I reckon Ed Briggs knew what he was doing. An undertaker's always a good risk. That ain't the reason, Pa! Well, I was giving you a compliment, son. Pa's right. The only thing you can be sure of in life is people go on dying. Mama Follet, I'd rather say they go on being born. That too, Mary. They've got to be born before they can die. Why don't we get started? Rufus? You know, the trouble with my wife is she doesn't appreciate how I try to please her. Now, you ask Ma there how many things she's done without all of her life, and you'll see how lucky you are. Now, I know one thing I can do without is any more of this kind of talk. Sure, Ralph, come on. We've all been looking forward to a good time today. I'm having a good time. Jim Wilson. Jim Wilson! Come on, out in the yard, boy. Start enjoying yourself. Oh, come here, darling. You want some lemonade? Well, she empties him, out. She turns right around, fills him back up again. Jim Wilson, did you see Rufus in there? Rufus is a baby! Rufus is a baby! Ralph, you're to stop that. I'm teasing, Mary. Well, whatever it is you're doing, you're to stop. The child just had a normal accident. Why, Jim Wilson hasn't had an accident like that in years, and he's 11 months younger than Rufus. Well, I don't care what Jim Wilson does. Oh, Sally. Goodness sakes, you know that isn't so. Jim Wilson, Aunt Mary just cares the world about you. Goddamn it. Why does everything I say here damn get myself in trouble. I'll thank you not to take the Lord's name in vain, Ralph. Well, now this family ain't Catholic, and I'm gonna take the Lord's name anyway it comes to my mind. You sure do like to hit all the bases, don't you, Ralph? I'm sorry for what I said, Jay. Mary, honey, Jim Wilson does pee his pants, everyday without fail. And I think you ought to get Rufus out here and apologize to him for making fun of him. -Sure, Jay. Course, course. Rufus, Rufus, come on down here. Come on. It's your Uncle Ralph calling you. Come on. I'm ain't gonna tease you no more, I promise. Here he comes. Come on down. I got something for you. Come on. Take it. Ralph Follet, mortician. We friends again? Oh yes, sir. Oh no! Let me go. Oh. Oh my! That's what I like to see, everybody being friends. All us Follets is friends, ain't we, Mary? Of course we are, Ralph. Well, if we're gonna get there this afternoon, we'd best get started. Ma's right. Come on, everybody. Let's go. Thank you, darlin'. Jay, you and Mary ride up front with me. Rufus, you're gonna sit on my lap, and I might even let you steer. I think Jay ought to drive. Drive my car? Well, you're in no condition to drive it. Well, nobody else is going to drive it. Not my car, I can tell you that. Can we go in your car, Jay? The Tin Lizzie? We can't all get into it. Well, I would rather be a little crowded and have Jay do the driving. Oh, Jay this, and Jay that, and why don't we ask Jay's advice? Hundred times you wouldn't ride with this boy neither. He's been in the gutter, and in the jailhouse, and worse than that! All right, Ralph. Then, you go ahead in the Chalmers. We'll follow behind with Jay in his car. What are you gonna do? Gonna sit up front with him, rub your leg against him? Is that him you're after now. Is that it? That thought never once come into Sally's head, and you know it. So drive, Ralph. Don't get no big ideas you're the only one she's after. She's after any man with a flat belly. Don't matter to her, long as his belly don't get in the way. See, I can't stand no damn flat-bellied-- I got a good mind to go over and give Kaiser Wilhelm a punch in his nose. Then the lot of you'd show me some respect! Well, I better make you comfortable again, Pa. Oh, every time he sets out to enjoy himself, he just gets so unhappy. I'll look after him, Jay. I reckon you've had to do enough of that kind of looking after people for your time. Smell my hands, Jay. Oh, Ralph. Come on and smell them hands. There ain't nothing on your hands, Ralph. It is too. It's that formaldehyde, Jay. I can't smell it, but everybody else can. I scrub 'em. I scrub 'em. I can't get rid of the smell. Well, last night, I was in the picture show. I sat down next to this girl, Jay. And she got up and moved. Now, it was that smell that did that. Don't you think? No, you're the worst tail chaser in La Follette. The picture was good though, Jay. It was Charlie. You like Charlie? Sure do. Last night, he had a sack of eggs, and he put 'em in the seat of his britches, and then he sat down on it. Rufus and I seen that one. You and me like a lot of the same things, Jay. We're more brothers than we seem. I reckon people know we was brothers. Thank you for that. Well, they're all out there saying, Ralph's been in there long enough to have two drinks. I only had one, so I'd better have too. You sure can hold it, Ralph. Go on. Help yourself. Everybody's waiting on us, Ralph. Come on, Jay. Mary ain't gonna see. I'll keep a watch out for you. It ain't that. Sure are reformed, ain't you. I'm just thinking of you. If you keep blowing away that bottle, it ain't gonna last you through the day, and I know that feeling when the bottle's empty and ain't full. I want the bottle to be empty, Jay. I'm no good when I'm like this. I'm mean, and I'm-- I'm reckless. I'm not real. I want the bottle to be empty, Jay. Jay. There. It's empty. Now you ready to go? How does it make you feel? A little bit don't let me feel anything at all. Well, what if you had a whole lot? Come on, Ralph. If we're gonna get to great-grandma's and back before dark, we've got to start. No, sir. I ain't gonna move, not from this spot. Not till you tell me how it makes you feel. Ralph! If I had as much as you, Ralph, I'd go quiet, so quiet I could hear the ticking of the earth, and I'd be young as ever I could remember, and nothing had ever happened to me ever would. I wouldn't dare talk to no one, of course, for fear they'd show me the lie. Pretty soon, it'd get so lonesome in there all by myself. I'd go off like a firecracker. You happen to be standing by, you'd get a few powder burns, let me tell you. What made you change, Jay? Was it Mary's religion? Mary's religion is her own. Why'd you do it, then? I made a vow to myself. I said if I ever get drunk again, I'd kill myself. Oh, Jay. That's a pretty strong vow. I couldn't afford to leave myself any loopholes. Don't you never get thirsty? There's too many reasons why I don't wanna kill myself! What reason? There's two of 'em right out there in the yard. As a matter of fact, two and a half. Now, come on, Ralph. I promised them an outing today. They've been looking forward to it for weeks, and I'm not gonna disappoint them. I've got reasons out there in that yard too, ain't I, Jay? Come on. Wipe off your face. You worked yourself into a sweat. Yeah. I could take that vow of yours. Couldn't I, Jay? No one's gonna try and stop you. All right, Jay. I'm taking the vow right now. Stand back there. Or, Jay, I could take a vow, that if I was to ever get drunk again I would take your vow. Well, you better think on it, Ralph. It's a serious step. All right. I'll tell you what, Jay. I hereby take a vow to think on it. Good for you. OK. OK? How long has it been since you've all seen great-grandma? I was the last one to see her. I come here one day about 20 years ago. 20 years? Why, Ralph, you have a wonderful memory to find the way. Oh, I'll always had a pretty good memory. Well, that's remarkable. How about you, Jay? How long since you've seen her? I've been studying it-- nearly 13 years. The last time was just before I went to Panama. Oh, then, you were the last one to see her. No, wait a minute. Excuse me. I've seen her since then. What? Are you sure that's the place, Ralph? That don't like I remember it. Of course. That's it. We're just coming up on it from behind is all. She doesn't live there all by herself, does she? My sister, Sadie, gave her life to her. She wouldn't come live with none of us. I raised my whole family in this cabin, she says. Lived all my life, since I was 14 years old, and I aim to die here. Well, it must have been more than 35, close to 40 years since grandpa died. Goodness sakes. And she was an old woman then. She's 103 years old. Oh my. 103 or 104, she never could remember for sure which, but she knows she wasn't born later than 1812. She's always reckoned it might have been 1811. You know what she is, Rufus? She's Grandpa Follet's grandmother. That's fact, Rufus. I bet you never figured as you'd ever hear me call nobody grandma, did you? No, sir. Well, you're gonna. Are you listening to all this, Jim Wilson? She's an old, old lady. Old. Lord God, Lord God. Howdy Sadie. Howdy, John Henry. Thought maybe you wouldn't have noticed. Oh, I knowed you all the minute I laid eyes on you. I just couldn't believe it. Howdy, Jessie. Good to see you, Sadie. Howdy, Aunt Sadie. Howdy, Jay. You Jay's brother? I'm Ralph, Aunt Sadie. Howdy, Ralph. That's my machine we come in. And-- and this is my bride, Sally. That's how I think of her. Pretty. And this is Mary Ann. Sadie, Mary, this is Aunt Sadie. I'm proud to know you. I figured it was you and Rufus. Say hello to Aunt Sadie. Hello, Aunt Sadie. Jim Wilson, I want you to give Aunt Sadie a hug and a kiss, OK? This is my boy, Aunt Sadie. Howdy. How's grandma? Oh, well as we got any right to expect. But don't feel put out if she don't know none of yous. Now, she might, and she might not. Half the time, she doesn't even know me. Poor old soul. If I was you, I'd come up on her kind of easy. It's been a coon's age since she's seen so many folks all at once. Me neither. You just might scare her if youse come a-hopping up on her in a flock. Maybe you'd better see her the first, Pa. You're the eldest. Well, it's not me she wants to see. It's the youngins' who'd tickle her most. I reckon that's right. If'n she can take any notice. She sure near cracked her heels when she heard your boy was born. Proud as Lucifer. Because he is the first. I know. Fifth generation that made. Sally and I lost a baby the year before Rufus was born. That would have been the first. That so? She always took a shine to you. I always did take a shine to her. Did you get her postcard? What postcard? When your boy was born? Why, no. Well, she told me what to write on one of them postcards, and to put it in mail to the two of youse, and I done it. Didn't you never get it? That's the first I've heard tell of it. What street did you send it to, Aunt Sadie? Because we moved right before Rufus was born. Well, I never sent it to no street. I never knowed I needed to, Jay working in the post office and all. Aunt Sadie, I quit working for the post office a long time back. I'm in law now for Mary's Pa. Oh, well, I guess that's how come, then. 'Cause I just sent it to post office Cristobal Canal Zone, Panama. And I spelt it right. C-R-I-- Aunt Sadie, I've been living in Knoxville since before I was married even. Well, they might just as well put me out to grass. Just lay me down, and give me both barrels right through the head. MARY: Why, Aunt Sadie! Oh, I know that like I know my own name. It just plumb slipped my mind. MARY: What a shame! If'n I get like that too, who's gonna take care of her? What did she say in the postcard, Aunt Sadie? Oh. Well, now, let me figure. It's been so long. "Ah, being borned again," she said "love, great-grandma." Born again? Why, that's beautiful. Maybe. I always figured being borned once was enough. [laughter] Grandma, you got company. It's Jay, and his wife, and the others come up from Knoxville to see you. She knows who you are. Come here, Jay. Now, don't holler. It just scares her. You just talk real loud and real plain, right up close to her ear. I know. My mama is deaf. Grandma. I'm Jay, John Henry's boy. I figure she knows who you are. She can't talk anymore, can she? SADIE: Well, times she can, times she can't. Ain't so seldom called for talk, I reckon she loses the hang of it. But I figure she knows who you are, and I'm tickled she does. Come here, Rufus. Go to him. Just call her "grandma." Get up right close to her ear, like you do to Grandma Lynch, and you say, "Grandma, I'm Rufus." Grandma, I'm Rufus. Now, come out where she can see you. I'm Rufus. Tell her, "I'm Jay's boy, Rufus." RUFUS: I'm Jay's boy, Rufus. JAY: Now, kiss her. [mumbling] MARY: Jay. JAY: Let 'em be. SADIE: All right, grandma. It's all right, grandma. It's all right. It's all right, grandma. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Is she all right? All she knows is somethings been took from her. Ain't none of us ever gonna see grandma again. I wouldn't be surprised, pa. The hand of death's coming close to this family. Well, when her time comes, I'll be proud to officiate, free of charge, of course. Mama, do you know what happened? What, dear? Great-great-grandma had an accident when I kissed her. Isn't she too old for that, mama? Isn't she? [applause] ANNOUNCER: "All the Way Home" will resume after these messages. You sleep now, Google-eyes? Look what i found. What, dear? This old dog, Jackie. Goodness sakes, where was it? In the corner under the crib. I was scaring the bogeyman out of there. Under the crib? Shame on me. Poor little old Jackie. Is Rufus asleep now? Yeah, he's asleep. What was the matter with him? It was a bad dream, I reckon. Poor old Jackie. Remember when I got him? Of course I do. Oh, you took such pleasure in picking him out. And Jackie was bigger than Rufus. And I had to explain. "It's a dog," I had to say. And "a dog" was too big a word in those days. I gave you too soon, Jackie. And here it is, too late, left behind with the baby crib. I certainly am glad we kept that baby crib. Save us buying a new one. Back to the corner with you, Jackie. Darlin', don't leave him there. What is it, Jay? Nothing. I reckon it's just seeing great-grandma again, and remembering the summers I had out there, and seeing Pa begin to shrink up, and watching Ralph, feeling Rufus growing bigger, and singing those sad old songs, and finding Jackie. It's just the day, Mary. It's been a long one. Yeah. Jackie's ear come off. It's enough to make a man thirsty. How far we all come, Mary. How far we all come away from ourselves. So far, so much between, you don't know where you started, what you had in mind, or where you thought you were going. All you know is you headed someplace. One way you do remember-- you have a boy or a girl of your own, and every now and then, you sing to 'em are hold 'em. And you know they feel. It's almost as if you were your own self again. Just think, Mary. My pa used to sing to me, back before I was born, even before I was dreamed of in this world, his mama or his papa used to sing to him way on back through the mountains, back past great-grandma, way on back through the years, all the way back to Adam. And nobody ever sang to Adam. God did. Maybe God did. We're supposed to come away from ourselves, Jay. That's the whole point. We're supposed to come away from ourselves. I know, to God. I don't know how you can feel the way you do and not believe in Him. We come from people, Mary. And in time, they fall away from us, like great-grandma. We give birth to others, and in time, they grow away from us, like Rufus will. When we're about 80 years old, you and me, all we'll have left is us. And that's what I believe in. Maybe that's it. Maybe that's where we're headed, to each other. And the sad part-- all our lives was the distance between us. But maybe, if we keep going in the direction we think is right, maybe we can't ever get all the way there. At least we can make the distance less than it was. Oh, Jay. Jay. You'll catch cold down here like that. I'll warm up the bed for you. When I was a youngster on the farm, on cold nights, we all used to pile into one bed together. Finally, I was too big for that, but I wasn't too big to cry at being left alone in a big, cold bed all by myself. And my ma, she brought me her own pillow, and she said-- she put it under the pillows next to me, and she said for me to pretend that it was one of them keeping me warm and watching over me through the night. My poor ma, she slept without a pillow for a couple of months there. [laughter] And your job is to get the other side of the bed warm for me. [phone ringing] Who in the world could that be this time of night? Damn it. Hello. Yes, Central. This is Jay Follet. Put him through. Who is it? It's Ralph. Hey there, Ralph. What's the trouble? You crying, Ralph? Pa? Look, Ralph, you're not putting me out. Just tell me about Pa. Oh my god. I should come up, huh. Oh my god. Oh, hold on, Ralph. Just hold on right there. You know damn well I'm coming up if that's serious. So-- so don't give me none of that. Just tell me how sick is he, really, Ralph. Well, think, dammit! Is there a doctor? The doctor, what's he say? From the way you tell me then I suspect the doctor said a good chance. Well, never mind it, Ralph. Look, I'm talking too much. I'm coming on up. I'll be there-- what time is it now? -It's 11:30. -It's 11:30. Ralph, I'll be there about 2:00, 2:30. Well, I'm afraid that's the best my old Tin Lizzie can make it, Ralph. You tell ma I'm coming on up. Jay, is he conscious? Is he conscious? Well, if he gets conscious, just tell him I'm coming on up quick as I can. It's all right, Ralph. Don't mention. Mary understands. Ralph, good night. Good night, Ralph. God. Talking to him is like trying to put socks on an octopus. Is it very grave? Lord knows. I can't be sure of anything with Ralph, but I can't afford to take the risk. Of course not. What are you up to? I'm gonna fix you something to eat. I can pick up something on the way if I want to. -In an all night lunchroom. -It'll be quicker. I don't want your mama to think I don't feed you. All right, all right. Seen my tobacco? Oh, you had it all ready for me. I had to guess which pipe you wanted. Just the one I was looking for. It's the one I gave to you. Yeah. You have time for a cup of coffee at least. It's the way you like it. The pot's chock full of old grounds. And I even added some new. I'd just as soon want to drink sulfuric acid. [laughter] The outing today must been too much for him. Pa sits there so quiet anymore. We don't always know what's going on underneath. He got home and just collapsed. Isn't it funny, Jay? He was saying just this afternoon you'd be losing your great-grandmother soon. Now it turns out your father's the one in danger. I guess we never know who's in danger. You got a birthday coming up. What would you like to do? Jay, you nice thing. Well, you think it over. Whatever you like best, within reason, of course. I'll see we manage it. That is, of course, if everything goes the way we hope it will up home. It's time, isn't it? Yeah. You're almost looking forward to it, aren't you, Jay? Driving through the night, when everyone else is asleep, the all night lunchroom, driving fast. I just know I have to go, Mary, so I'm anxious to get started. Just don't drive too fast. Scrapelings for him to find in the morning for his collection. Maybe we ought to wake him up. I'm afraid he's going to be awfully disappointed you didn't say goodbye. I looked in on him. Tell you what, tell him-- don't promise him or anything, of course-- but just tell him that I'm practically sure to be back before he's asleep tomorrow night. Tell him I'll do my best. All right. Now, give you mother my love. Tell her they're both in my thoughts and wishes constantly, and your father too, if he's well enough to talk. You shouldn't come any further. It was so warm this afternoon. [phone ringing] Hello? Yes, Central. Go ahead. Jay? Jay, darlin', I've been so anxious all day. How's your father? Oh, dear. Then you went all that way for nothing. Jay. Jay, there's no sense in getting angry about it. You know how Ralph is. Just be thankful your father's all right. Rufus, come say hello to Grandma Lynch. Where's your hat? I forgot. Well, get it . What's that, dear? No, I'm sorry. I didn't hear. What? Oh, well, then you'll definitely be here for supper. The family's coming up. If that's Jay, give him my, love. Yes, mama's here already. And she sends her love. The others will be coming up later. Andrew has a present for me that they're all being very mysterious about, so do try to make it, Jay. Oh, well, darlin'-- no, darlin', don't hurry, not if it means racing, because I can hold supper. Well, I would rather hold it than have you race. All right, then. We'll see you very soon. Thank you very much for calling. Jay, goodbye. Excuse me. Rufus, what are you doing there? You're supposed to be at the street car stop. I was looking for the surprise. What surprise? Daddy should be in here someplace. Oh, Rufus, darlin'. He said so, didn't he? You're not to ask any questions, Rufus. Now, you can't keep Aunt Hannah waiting. Now, that was your papa on the phone. He says Grandpa Follet's going to be all right. Isn't that wonderful? And he says he'll be home for supper. Think of that, Rufus. You'll be able to see him before you go to bed tonight. Now, what are you going to say to Aunt Hannah? I'm glad to go shopping. "I'm so glad." I'm so glad to go shopping with you, Aunt Hannah. And thank you for thinking-- "Thank you very much." And thank you very much for thinking of me. All right, all right. Now, say it all together. I am so glad to go shopping with you, Aunt Hannah. And thank you very much for thinking of me. Very good. You be sure to help her with her parcels now. You always dress him so well, Mary dear. Oh. Hey, there he is. What's your name? You know. No, I don't. Tell me. I told you yesterday. No, honest. I don't know your name. You're just trying to tease me. I don't think he's got a name at all. He's a no-name-nothing. No-name-nothing. Just leave him alone. Stop picking on him. What do you mean picking on a little kid like that. Pick on someone your own size. I didn't mean nothing. Don't pay no attention to them. I'll tell me-- I'll tell you my name if you answer a question. What question? You gotta promise to answer it first. Cross my heart and body. Now, what's your name? It's Rufus. Nigger's name, nigger's name, nigger's name! It is not either. I got it from my great-grandpa Lynch. Then, your grandpa's a nigger too. My great-grandpa. He is not! Rufus's grandpa's a nigger. He's a nigger! He's a nigger! What is all this? Afternoon, ma'am. We-- we gotta go! Yeah, I think it's about time. You didn't answer my question! Never mind, Rufus. Never mind. What was it you wanted to ask those boys. Perhaps I can help you. Mama says we got a surprise coming to our house. Oh? Well, why were you going to ask those boys about it? Because daddy said if mama didn't tell me about it I'd find out from the older boys in the street. [laughter] How do those boys know about surprises coming to our house, Aunt Hannah? Did Daddy tell them? Well, off course not. They don't know a thing. Daddy said they did. Well, Rufus, he didn't mean they knew exactly. He just meant that-- Rufus, I'm sure that your mother saw to that you had a clean handkerchief before you came out today. Can I clean your glasses, Aunt Hannah? If you promise to be very careful. I promise. Rufus, I know about the surprise. You do? Oh yes, and I could tell you about it, but there are certain things that should only be told by certain people. Now, for instance, your scoot teacher is the one to tell you about arithmetic, because she knows about it. Now, your mother and your father are the only ones to tell you about this particular surprise. Oh, there's plenty of others that'd be willing to tell you if you asked them, but you mustn't ask them. Why not, Aunt Hannah? Well, because they wouldn't tell it right. Wouldn't you tell it, right? Breathe on the lenses, child. [laughter] You wait for your mama to explain. You'll be glad you did later on. Mama Jackson and I have had the loveliest afternoon planning aid for war-stricken Europe. And since we were all to come here for supper, I saw no reason for going home only to come out again. So I thought I'd stop by early, Mary dear, and we could have a nice, quiet chat. Lovely, mama. I beg pardon? We can have a nice, quiet chat! Oh, lovely! 'Cause when your papa finds out I've been with Father Jackson, no telling what he'll say. Well, I simply shan't listen. Mama. [phone rings] Bathroom? Telephone. Oh. Hello? Yes, Central, go ahead. Jay? Jay, darlin', I've been so anxious all day. How's your father? Oh, dear, then you went all that way for nothing. Jay-- Jay, there's no sense in getting angry about it. You know how Ralph is. Just be thankful your father's all right Rufus, come say hello to Grandma Lynch. Where's your hat? I forgot. Well, get it. What's that, dear? No, I'm sorry. I didn't hear. What? Oh, well, then, you'll definitely be here for supper. The family's coming up. If that's Jay, give him my love. Yes, mama's here already. And she sends her love. The others will be coming up later. Andrew has a present for me that they're all being very mysterious about, so do try to make it, Jay. Oh, well, darlin', no, darlin,' don't hurry, not if it means racing. 'Cause I can hold supper. Well, I would rather hold it than have you race. All right, then. We'll see you very soon.

Why not, Aunt Hannah? Well, because they wouldn't tell it right. Wouldn't you tell it right? Breathe on the lenses, child. [laughter] You wait for your mama to explain. You'll be glad you did later on. Well, there you are. What is that bunchy place under your jacket? It's my hat. Well, let's put it on. Oh, where does your mother buy your clothes? Miller's! Why that's women's clothes cut to fit little boys. I think when we've done our shopping on Gay Street we'll go round to Market Street. Mama won't go on Market Street. Well, we're going into Harbison's there. I hear they're very sporty. And I'm going buy you a cap! Or is there something else you'd rather have? Oh no, no! Well, we'll see what we can do about it. Oh, Aunt Hannah, I am so glad to go shopping with you. And thank you very much for thinking of me. Your mother told you to say that, didn't she? I forgot. Mhm. Well, I know a direct quotation when I hear it. [applause] Joel, I wish you wouldn't stand there. I can't do my best when I'm being watched. What the devil do you think you're playing? "The Burning of Rome." Well, let's hear it, then. Rufus is asleep. Good god. You know, papa, we gotta face the possibility, you and I, that Jay is drunk somewhere and be ready for it. Rot. Well, Mary's thinking it, though, ever since supper. And she's worried too, papa. I can tell. She's got what Jay calls "that pursed up look." Shall I go look for him? Where would you look? Well, he used to like those places down off of Market Square. And that's lively down there at night, papa, with the farmers rolling into town and the smell of salt, and leather, and fresh vegetables, and whiskey. If that's where he is, let the man come home on his own. It'll be hard enough for him when he gets here. You might as well learn, Andrew, it's the way of our women to try to break their man with piety. Or is it the way of our men, papa, to try to break their women with impiety? I was just asking. I've never been able to decide who I am-- your son or mama's. Not everyone has such a wide choice. [laughter] Rufus is finally asleep. Oh, good. He was terribly disappointed that Jay hadn't come home yet. Well, he'll be along soon. You think I've been deserted, papa? You think my husband has gone off, never to return? Will you take care of me again, papa, if I'm deserted? Will you let me come home, and sit on your lap, and cry for my lost love? No, daughter. Why not? 'Cause you're never gonna be deserted. Oh, papa. You're always defending Jay. I've always thought highly of him from the first. --You would defend Jay to the skies on one hand and on the other, while practically in the same breath you'd be given me reason after reason why it'd be plain foolhardy to marry him. Now, isn't it possible that I meant both things? I don't know how. You learned how yourself, Mary. Is that what I learned? I've taken Jay into the office. Now, that shows confidence. He's teaching himself law. Your confidence is justified. That's what I wanted. What? To hear you defend him. Oh, papa. Me defend Jay? Why, I could never defend Jay enough. Papa, in these past few months, we've come to a kind of harmoniousness that's so beautiful. Why, I just have no right to talk about it. It's just the gulfs between us, papa. If I could just fill in all the gulfs, everything would be perfect. Oh, I want life to be perfect, papa. Now, why doesn't he come home? Andrew, I am ready to see that present now. Well, I shouldn't make you wait for your birthday, Mary. It was meant to be your birthday present. Well, what is it? A new picture you'd done? I think you'll like it, Mary. Yes, Mary. Oh, you've also seen it. Mama, will you give us a little fanfare for the unveiling? [laughter] She didn't-- she didn't hear you, Andrew. Mama, Andrew wants you to play us a fanfare. Oh. [playing piano] Oh, Andrew. It's Jay. You like it? It is Jay. I think Andrew caught a very good likeness. Especially around the mouth and chin. Oh, yes. Right through there especially. Well, the eyes were the hardest. Well, they always are, unless the subject sits for you, and I didn't want Jay to do that, because you both would have known. I've been making sketches for months. Oh, he wouldn't have done it anyway. Can you imagine Jay sitting still for an artist? Yes. The picture has great dignity. So's Jay. I love it, Andrew. Thank you. Daddy. Daddy! I guess we were making a racket. There's little Rufus. Did daddy come home yet? No, dear. What made you think so? I woke up. I wanted to show him my cap. Rufus, darlin', I told you, you can't wear that cap to bed. Aunt Hannah will never forgive you. Rufus, come give grandma a good hug. Oh, nice little boy. Mary, dear, do you think he ought to wear his cap to bed? [phone ringing] Oh, maybe that's Jay. Bathroom? Telephone. Oh. Come on, Rufus. Let grandma put you to bed this time, hm? Hello? Hello? I'm sorry, I can't hear you. You'll have to talk a little. I say, I can't hear you. You'll have to talk a little louder. -It's long distance all right. -Oh dear. His father's worse. Well, at least we know where Jay is. Yes, that's better. Thank you. Yes, this is she. What is it? Yes, I heard. Yes, there's my brother. Where should he come to? Brennick's, left of the pike, Bell's Bridge. Do you have a doctor? A doctor, do you have one? All right, then. My-- my brother will come out just as quickly as he can. Thank you very much for calling. Good night. Andrew, there's been an-- that a man from Powell Station about 12 miles out towards La Follette. He says-- he says that Jay has met with a very serious accident. He wants-- he-- he says-- he want-- he says they want some man from his family to come out just as quickly as possible, and help bring him in, I guess. Shall I get Doctor Decal? He says, no, just you. I guess there's a doctor there already. Yes, I guess so. Where do I go? -Powell Station, about 12-- -I know, but exactly where? Did they say? Yes, he-- it was Brennick's Blacksmith Shop. B-R-E-N-N-I-C-K. He said that they would leave the lights on for you, and you can't miss it. It's just to the left of the pike just this side of Bell's bridge. I won't be any longer than I have to. Yes. We'll-- we'll-- we'll have everything ready here, you know, in case he's well enough to be brought home. Good. I'll phone the minute I know anything-- anything. Bless you, dear. Where is he hurt? He didn't say. Well, didn't you ask? Joel. No matter. Where's mama? She's upstairs with Rufus. Papa, would you-- would you keep her up there just for a few minutes until I-- make sure Rufus is asleep, papa. Make sure he's asleep, and then tell mama what's happened. Talk just as softly as you can, and still have her know what it is you're saying. Would you like us to go home, Mary? No. No. We'll keep out of the way. It's not that. It's just, with mama it's so very hard to talk. Oh, for heaven's sake's Joel, go along. What time is it, Aunt Hannah? Uh, it's almost 10:25. Well, let's see now. Andrew drives pretty fast, though not as fast as Jay, but he'll be driving better than usual tonight, and it's just about 12 miles. So that would be now-- just supposing he goes 30 miles an hour at 12 miles. 30-- at 30 miles an hour, at 30 miles-- 30 miles, half of 30 would be-- oh, I was always so dreadful at figures. Well, it's only 12 miles. We should hear very soon. Why don't we have a cup of tea? Why don't you let me? What? Let me know if there's anything I can help with. Not a thing. Thank you. We could make up the downstairs bedroom. Remember, he stayed there when he sprained his poor back. It's better than upstairs, closer to the kitchen and bathroom, and no stairs to climb. He's always saying we have to get a bathroom up stairs, but then we never do. Then, of course, if need be, that is, if he needs a nurse, we could put her in the dining room and eat in here. Or we could set a cot up right in the room with him and put up a screen. Or if-- if she minds that, we could put her right on the living room davenport and keep the door open in between. Don't you think so? Certainly. Of course, there's always the possibility he'll have to be taken straight to the hospital. The man did say it was very serious after all. Would you like milk or sugar? Or lemons? Oh my. I don't think I have any lemons, Aunt Hannah. Well, milk is fine with me. Yes, it's fine with me too. Would you like some zuzus or bread and butter toast? I could toast us up some. No, just tea will do. Well, hear are the zuzus. Well, thank you. Goodness sakes, the watched pot. Mary, I hope you didn't really mind my giving Rufus that cap. Goodness, no. You were good to do it. Well, I'm sure if you'd known how much he wanted one, you would have given it him yourself a long time ago. Yes, of course. At Harberson's, isn't that where you got it? I hear it's so tough there. How did you ever dare to go in? Well, fortunately, I'm so blind I can't see what might hurt me. Now, I just sailed up to the nearest man. I said, "where do I go, please, to get a cap for my nephew?" And he said, "I'm no clerk, ma'am. I'm a customer here myself." And I said, "well, then why aren't you wearing a hat?" He had no answer to that, of course. Why didn't he tell me? HANNAH: Who? The man on the phone. Why didn't I ask? I didn't even ask. Where is he hurt? How serious is it? Papa noticed. HANNAH: You couldn't think. Is he living or dead? HANNAH: That we'll simply have to wait and found out. Yes, we have to wait. That's what's so unbearable. Try if you can to find a mercy in it. A mercy? A little time to prepare ourselves. I'm sorry, Aunt Hannah. You're quite right. I am going down to see if there isn't something I can do for poor dear Mary. But it's my place to, isn't it, Joel? I don't know as I really want any tea. I just think it would be a good idea to drink something warm while we wait. I'd like some. I have decided there is no cause for worry, Mary, dear. Jane is perfectly all right, I'm sure. And Andrew was simply too overjoyed with relief to bother to phone. And he's bringing Jay straight home instead as a wonderful surprise. That would be like Andrew, and like Jay to go along with the surprise, and enjoy it, and just laugh at how scared we've all been. Of course, we shall have to scold the both of them. Joel, what Andrew is doing is coming in with Jay's poor body to the undertaker's. Robert's, probably. Although they do say that new man in Euclid Avenue is very good, but our family has always used Robert's. Did Rufus pick his cap out himself? Well, you don't think I chose that monstrosity, do you? No. First, he picked out a very genteel little serge, but I smelled the hypocrisy behind it. And forgive an old woman, Mary, but I said, "do you really like that one, or did you just pick it out to please your mother?" He then revealed his true taste, but I was swift to-- [laughter] Either he's badly hurt and will live, or he's so terribly hurt that he will die from it, maybe after a long and terrible struggle. He may be breathing his last right now and wondering where I am and why I'm not there. Or he was already gone when the man called. Of course, it's just what we have no earthly business guessing about how, and I'm not going to say he's dead until I'm sure that he is. Certainly not. But I'm all but certain that he is all the same. Oh my God, I do beseech Thee. Let it not be so. Aunt Hannah, would you kneel down with me for a minute, Aunt Hannah? Aunt Hannah? No, Mary. Why? It's too easy. As you say, it's one thing or the other. And no matter what it is, there's not one thing in this world or the next that we can do, or wish, or guess at, or hope, or pray that can change it one iota. Because whatever it is, is. All we can do now is be ready for it, whatever it may be. I'm trying to be ready. Mary, your beliefs have never been truly tested. God has come easily to you. He's going to come harder now. But if you wait until you can't go on without Him, you'll find Him. When you have to pray, we'll pray. Goodness sakes, why don't I fix up his room? It's your turn now. What time is it, Joel? 12:45, a quarter to 1:00. Andrew has had time to get there and back, hasn't he, Joel? Twice. Don't shout at me, Joel. Just speak distinctly. I can hear you. Just think, Joel. It'll be a posthumous baby. Good god, woman. We haven't had a posthumous birth in this family since-- your cousin Lenny was posthumus, wasn't she? Of course. Your uncle Henry was killed in the war between the states. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses. Mary. He's dead, Andrew, isn't he? He was dead when you got there. He was instantly killed. Oh. Papa! Mary, sit down. Mama! Sit down, darling. Sit down. Mama! There, there, Mary, dear, there, there. Hell, Mary, it's just plain hell. Instantly, papa, instantly. Quick as that, quick as that. He was at this blacksmith's shop, and they made me look at him. Instantly! It was reeking horse flank and they made me look. I'd never seen a dead man before, and it was Jay. Instantly! The flat of the hand, the flat of the hand of death, the flat of the hand of death. For god's sake, Andrew, think of your sister! It's all right, papa. It's all right. It's all right. What happened, Andrew? Give yourself a minute, Mary. No, I don't want any of this, mama. I wanna know what happened, Andrew. I have to tell you? JOEL: Tell her. I can't. I can't be the one. What happened? -I don't even know how to begin. -Just begin. Where? JOEL: Anywhere. Well, he was alone, for one thing. Of course he was alone. I know that. ANDREW: I mean, there was no one else in the accident or other automobiles. -I wanna know about Jay. I'm trying to tell you. What caused the accident? ANDREW: A Cotter pin. What is a Cotter pin? ANDREW: You wouldn't understand, Mary. You don't know about automobiles. Papa, please make him tell me. All right. It's just something that holds the steering mechanism together, like this. There'd be a hole for these knuckles, and that's where the Cotter pin goes, like a hairpin. And you open the ends flat, and you spread them. MARY: I understand. The Cotter pin fell out. And then what happened? ANDREW: No one knows. We can't say. He just lost control of the auto. Who found him? ANDREW: The man who telephoned you. Who was that? ANDREW: I don't know his name. I wish you did. He was driving towards town about 9 o'clock when he heard Jay coming up from behind, terrifically fast. All of a sudden, he said he heard a terrifying noise, and then dead silence. He turned around, and he drove back. Where was that? ANDREW: Just the other side of Bell's bridge. Where that little angle comes down? ANDREW: That's the place. He was thrown absolutely clear of the auto as it ran off the road. And then the car went up an eight foot embankment, tumbled back down right beside him, bottom side up, without even grazing him. They think when this Cotter pin fell out he must have been thrown forward very hard, so he struck his chin one sharp blow against the steering wheel, and that must have killed him. Killed him? Killed? Killed him? Jay! Papa, I'll never see him again. I'll never see him again! There, there, Mary. We're all here. Papa, mama! [sobbing] Andrew, I want whiskey! It'd do her good. Do us all good. I'll go down home and get some. No! It's-- it's in our closet. Just get a glass, Andrew. Papa. Yes, baby. yes, baby. Help me, papa. Come on with it, will you? Here, here. Here, darlin'. Here, darlin,' whiskey. Did you-- what did he look like? His clothes were hardly even rumpled. His brown suit. He was lying on his back. His face? Just a little blue bruise on his lower lip. Is that all? And a cut so small you can sew it up with one stitch. Where? On the exact point of his chin. Exact point of the chin, papa. The doctor said death was instantaneous, concussion of the brain. He can't of suffered, Mary, not a fraction of a second. I asked about that particularly, because I knew you'd wanna be sure. I saw his face. There wasn't a glimmer in pain it, only a kind of surprise, started. I suppose so. It was just that one chance in a million, just that one tiny area, just a certain angle, and just a certain sharpness of impact on the chin. If it'd been one half inch to one side, he'd be alive this minute. Shut up, Andrew. Oh, have some mercy. Have a little mercy. -I'm sorry, Mary. Let her cry, let her cry. Oh, God, God, forgive me. God, Forgive me. It's just so unbearable. God, please, please, forgive me. Forgive me, God. Forgive you? I say, O God, if you exist, goddamn you! Andrew! Mary, there is nothing to ask forgiveness for. There is nothing to ask forgiveness for. Mary, do you hear me? Do you hear me, Mary? I spoke to Him as if He had no mercy! Oh, Andrew! No, no. God, I spoke to God as if He had no mercy, as if He were just trying to torment me! That's why I asked Him to forgive me. All right, Mary. Listen to me. Our Lord on the cross, remember? O God, O God, why hast Thou forsaken me? Yes, and then did He ask for forgiveness? He was God. He didn't have to. He was human too, and He didn't ask it, nor was it asked of Him to ask it. No more are you, and no more should you. You're wrong, Mary. You're very wrong. What was it He said next, the very next thing? Father, into Thy hands. Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit. Father, into Thy hands. Father, into Thy hands I comm-- oh, Aunt Hannah, you never had anything but God. I had a man! I had a husband! I won't have God in his place, or this picture either, Andrew! I never saw that face before in my life before tonight! And eyes and a mouth? Papa, papa! Yes, baby. Yes, baby. Papa, please put it away. Yes, darling, I will. Put it away. I will, I will. Andrew, I want more whiskey. Mary, let me fix you one good hot toddy. I want a lot of whiskey! You'll make yourself drunk, Mary. Let me. You have tomorrow to think about, Mary. What's tomorrow? I want to get just as drunk as I can! Mother always said, in times of stress, the best thing to drink was buttermilk. [laughter] What are we laughing at? Buttermilk? What's so funny about buttermilk? All right now, we can't-- Don't you make me laugh! All right, now, children, children. I have never in my life been so thoroughly shocked and astonished. [laughter] Listen. ANDREW: What is it? Just listen. JOEL: What's up? Quiet, papa. There's something. ANDREW: I don't hear anything. HANNAH: Mary does. It's in the kitchen. I'll go see what it is. No, Andrew, not yet. Has somebody come into the house? ANDREW: What made you think so, mama? How stupid of me. I thought I heard footsteps. I must be getting old and dippy. Shh. It's Jay. Of course, it is. JOEL: What? He's come into the room with us now. Mary. It's Jay, Andrew. It's Jay. Who else would be coming here tonight, so terribly worried and terribly concerned for us? And I'm restless. Oh, oh, Andrew, feel his-- his restlessness. You mean you can feel it? I mean, it simply feels like his presence. Papa, how do you feel anything? JOEL: I feel goosebumps, of course, but that's from looking at your faces. He's going upstairs now. You gotta stop this, Mary. Quiet, papa, please. He's in Rufus' room. For God's sake, Mary, darlin', you're having hallucinations. Joel, I know that God in a wheelbarrow wouldn't convince you, but Mary knows what she's experiencing. Please, stop talking about it. Please. It-- it just means so much more than we could say. I-- I just wanna be quiet in the house now. By myself. I got a gal, and a sugar babe, too. I got it. My darlin.' I got a gal and a sugar babe too. Andrew, when you get home, telephone Jay's people and tell 'em what happened. Andrew, where is he? For God's sake, where is he? What do you mean? Where did you take him? To Robert's. Yes. Robert's. Bless you, Andrew. Jay, darlin'. Dear, are-- are you in here? Oh, Jay. Jay. O my God. O God. [applause] Don't you fret, everybody. I'm gonna see us through this grievous day. Jim Wilson, you get in here. You're gonna spend the afternoon with your cousin Rufus. You play nice with him. Andrew, I'm gonna take Mary, and ma, and pa in the Chalmers. You follow me with the others. How you feeling, pa? You be brave, ma. You just be brave. Just leave me, Ralph. I'm gonna be two sons to you now, ma. I'll be as many sons as you need. Just leave me be. Anybody else needs me, I'll be right outside. I do wish they'd get back from Robert's. Joel, it's getting late. Oh, I feel so bad about this dress, Mother Follet. You look fine, Sally. I wish it were black. Imagine being young enough not to have a black dress. If a woman has a usual life, one black dress will see her through it. I-- beg pardon? She really don't hear good, do she? [laughter] Grandma sitting up on that mountain for 103 years, and here's me down here with two attacks to my credit, and still Jay's the one that has to go. Not Jay, never Jay. Now, pa. I was all ready to go. What do you think of that? With a deceased brother, an undertaker, and willing to do the generous thing, and still she puts him in the hands of a stranger-- did you ever hear of such a thing as that? It's right for your brother to be buried here. Here is where his home was. Well, that don't make sense. He spent two thirds of his life in La Follette, and only a third here in Knoxville. You just didn't think of me. Never even thought of me, did you? No. My own brother, my only my brother. My own, my only husband. All right for you, Mary. All right for you. Come along, Rufus. There's Rufus now. I saw my daddy. Come to grandma. Come sit on grandma's lap. Well, I never. She didn't hear you, Miss Follet, no offense. I keep forgetting. Hi, Mary. Yes, papa. Well, I'll just put Jim Wilson in the downstairs bedroom for his nap, if that's all right. That's all right, Sally. Rufus, mama has to leave now. You stay with Grandma Lynch. You be very good and very quiet. Ah! I'm glad he's dead! Was he drunk? Mary. On top of everything else, a priest. Was my husband drunk? A Follet in the hands of a priest! Was he drunk, Ralph? Ralph, you were with him all afternoon, Ralph. Now, I have to know. You tell me. I ain't gonna tell you, Mary. You thought of me the night that he died, but you didn't want me. I ain't gonna tell you nothing. We must go, Mary. I ain't gonna tell you nothing. What's she gonna do? Ralph, are you all right to drive? Well, nobody else is gonna drive my Chalmers, let me tell you. Mary, the service is due to begin in a very few minutes. Well, I'm gonna stay right here in this room. Is she coming? The rest of you get in the cars. We'll come when we can. Why don't they leave? You too, Hannah. I'm not going. Then, I'm staying. If you are, please don't touch me. That miserable Ralph! Damn him! You were right, Hannah. God is coming to me a lot harder now, and Jay too. I can't seem to find either of them. This neck tie here, it was bought in Chattanooga someplace. When do you suppose? Sometimes, when Jay would go off like that, he'd be said to be seen as far as Claiborne County. But Chattanooga? Whatever made Jay do it ever? The night we moved into this house, where did he go? And when he went to work for papa in his office. Not the night Rufus was born, though. He was very dearly close to me then. But other times, when he'd feel himself being closed in, "watched by superintendents," he'd say. And then there was always this special quietness about him afterward when he'd come home, as if he were very far away from where he'd been, but very far away from me too, and keeping his distance, but working his way back. Let the man rest, Mary. I want him to rest. Aren't you even going to the funeral? Do you think he will rest simply by lowering him into the ground? Well, I won't watch. How can he, when he was lost on the very day he died? You don't know that he was lost, or drunk, or what he was. No, that's just what I don't know. And that's what you can't bear. I never knew, not for sure. Oh, there were times we all knew about, of course. But there were other times when it wasn't always whiskey, when he'd be gone for a night, or a day, or sometimes two, and I'd know he hadn't touched a drop. And it wasn't any of the other things that comes to a woman's mind, in case you're thinking that. I wasn't thinking that. Those are easy enemies. It was Market Square, and talking to country people about country secrets that go way on back through the mountains, and anyone who'd sing his old songs with him in all night lunchrooms. "What's an all night lunchroom for," he'd say, "except sitting in all night and drinking coffee so strong it'd burn your ribs?" It was locomotives, I suppose, and railroad people, and driving fast. Even Charlie Chaplin. "What's wrong with Charlie?" he'd ask me. Not because he didn't know what I'd say. Just to make me say it. He's so nasty, I'd say. He's so vulgar with his nasty little cane, hooking up skirts. And Jay, he would laugh, and he'd go off, and he'd see Charlie Chaplin. And he wouldn't come home. Where he went, I-- I can't possibly imagine. He'd never tell me. It was always easier to put everything down to whiskey. To put it down to any enemy. Why couldn't I let him have those things, whatever they were? If they meant something to him, why can't I let him have them now? The dear, he always worked his way back. Aunt Hannah, We can't wait any longer. In a minute, Andrew. They must be suffocating out in those cars. I'm glad Ralph didn't tell me. I must just accept not knowing, mustn't I? I must let Jay have what I don't know. What if he was drunk? What in the world if he was? Did I honestly think that was a gulf? This is a gulf. Oh, Hannah, if he was drunk, just if he was, I hope he loved being, speeding along through the night, singing at the top of his lungs, racing, because he loved to go fast, and racing home to us, because he loved us, and for a time enjoying, reveling in a freedom that was his that no place, or person, or nothing in this world could give him or take away from him. Let's hope that's how it was, Hannah. Let's hope that's how he looked death itself in the face, in his strength. That's what we'll put on the gravestone, Hannah. "In his strength." [applause] ANNOUNCER: "All the Way Home" will conclude after these messages. --[inaudible] mealymouthed son of a bitch. I tell you, Andrew, it's enough to make a man wretch up his soul! Was is a lovely funeral, dear? That Jackson, Father Jackson, as he insists on being called, not a word would he say over Jay's body, let alone read a service. 'Cause Jay's never been baptized. It's against the rules of the Church. Some Church! Andrew, is there something I should be hearing? Absolutely not, mama. Come on, Rufus. You come to one, simple, single act of Christian charity, and what happens? The rules of the Church forbid it. He's not a member of our little club. I only care, mind you, for Mary's sake. Joel, I don't know what you're saying, but I wish you wouldn't say it. Wait till we get home, dear, where what you say won't matter. [laughter] Good God. I tell you, Rufus, if anything ever makes me believe in God, or life after death, it'll be what happened this afternoon in Greenwood Cemetery. Now, there were a lot of clouds, but they were blowing fast, so there was lots of sunshine too. Right when they began to lower your daddy into the ground, into his grave, a cloud came over, and there was a shadow just like iron, and a perfectly magnificent butterfly settled on the coffin, just rested there, right over the breast, and stayed there, just barely making his wings breathe like a heart. He stayed there all the way down, Rufus, until it grated against the bottom like a rowboat. And just when it did, the sun came out just a dazzling bright, and he flew up and out of that hole in the ground, straight up into the sky so high I couldn't even see him anymore. Don't you think that's wonderful, Rufus? Yes, sir. If there are any such things as miracles, then, that's surely miraculous. Damn miracle. Did you notice how many people were there, Hannah? I didn't know half of them. We don't always realize, do we, many others love the people we love? Rufus says my face looks like my best China tea cup. You know, Hannah? The one Jay mended for me so many times? He's beginning to say things like that now, and I don't know where he gets it from. People fall away from us, and in time, others grow away from us. That's simply what living is, isn't it? Why don't you rest? You're the one. You haven't stopped for three days now. Oh, I'm not tired. You must be dead. Oh, the words that come to mind. No, not dead, just old. But I'm content to be. Well, you're going to rest for a few minutes. Well, there's supper to fix for that mob. Not yet. Well, maybe just for a moment. Hannah. HANNAH: Mhm? I love and revere everyone in this world who has ever suffered. I truly do, even those who have failed to endure it. I like the way you call me "Hannah" now, instead of "Aunt Hannah." We're that much closer. Oh, let me know when it's time to start again. I will. Be with us all you can, my darling, my dearest. This is goodbye. I quite agree with you, Joel. I didn't say anything. [laughter] Well, somebody did. What did they say? They said, "How fortunate we have been, you and I, to have lived for so many years without losing each other." I did say it. I must've been mistaken. No, no. You weren't mistaken, Catherine. That's what I said. Never mind, dear. How's your breath, pa? Pretty fair. You can actually feel summer coming on. At last. One more thing, Andrew. Would you keep an eye on Ralph for the rest of the day? He has to drive his family back to La Follette tonight, and we don't want any accidents. My! You can see all the way to North Knoxville. Rufus, mama has wanted to see more of you these last few days, a lot more. But do you know how much your mama loves you? With all her heart and soul, all her life, you know that, don't you? Are we still gonna get the surprise, mama? I promised you, didn't I? have you ever known me to break my promise? Well, then, the surprise will come, just as I said. You wanna know what it's gonna be, Rufus? What? A baby. You're gonna have a baby sister. Or it could turn out to be a baby brother. But I dearly hope it will be a sister. Isn't that wonderful? Yes, mama. But when can we get the baby? Not for a long time yet. But, Rufus, the time will pass quickly, a lot more quickly than you think. And when it does, and when she does come to us, I want you to help her all you can. Why? Because she'll be just beginning. She'll have so much to learn. I'm counting on you to teach her. 'Cause you'll be so much older and have so much more experience. She'll be so tiny and lost, you see, and very delicate. Like a butterfly? Rufus, what a beautiful thing to say. A very grown up way of putting it. Look, mama. There's a train crossing the viaduct. We have to go home now, darlin'. Let's just watch that train go by. Get on board, little children, get on board, little children, get on board, little children. There's room for many and more. Get on board, little children, get on board, little children, get on board, little children, there's room for many and more. Where's the baby now, mama? Up in hea-- no, it's not, Rufus. It's right here. It's right here, Rufus. You see, when a grown up man and a grown up woman love each other, truly love each other, the way your mama and your papa did, then they get married, and that's the beginning of a family. It'll happen to you one day, Rufus, a lot sooner than you think. So I want you to listen very carefully to everything I'm going to tell you. Because I think it's time that you knew. And I want you to ask questions, Rufus, if you don't understand. Will you do that for me, darlin'? [applause] Thank you. Merry Christmas, and God bless and keep the very brave people in Poland. All right. [applause]
