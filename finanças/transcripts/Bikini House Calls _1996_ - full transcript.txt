So who were you in your past lives? - Well let's see. From 1774 to 1798 I was a Zulu warrior in Africa. - Didn't live too long that time did you? - Oh no, it was a jungle out there. Oh and from 1806 to 1867, I was a promiscuous southern belle on a Carolina cotton plantation. - Who were you after that? - A nun in Vatican City. - Huh. Tell me about the promiscuous southern belle. - You know, I thought you'd ask me about that one. My name was Nelly. Nelly Anastasia Rydell. (magical music) My father, Obadiah Rydell made a fortune growing cotton for a French woman's underpants manufacturer. One morning when I was about 21 years old, I was sipping a mint julep on the veranda, a gentleman caller I'd come to know quite well came a calling. He was a Frenchman named Hugh Hardone. Monsieur Hardone was the buyer for the underwear manufacturer over in France. He'd come back by my by, very often to check the crops. Making sure the cotton was good quality befitting fine ladies underpants. Hugh didn't speak the English language very well so we developed this sort of uh, romantic shorthand. Knowing my daddy was out plowing the fields, Hugh wasted no time making his intentions known. We went upstairs to the room at the tip top of the house. There were windows all around looking out into the trees. We pretended we were a couple of squirrels jumping branches outside, gathering nuts for the long, lonely winter. Like the gentleman that he was Hugh helped me disrobe out of the cumbersome apparel that was fashion of the times. (rock music) - Did you ever see Hugh Hardone again? - No, his ship sunk off the coast of the Canary Islands. Yeah he went down with 1,100 bales of cotton. Yeah, well virgin cotton, which is much more than I can say for myself my dear. - Quite, what a sad ending. - Not really. That's the nice thing about reincarnation, you can just keep coming back and doing it over again. ♪ I feel my temperature rise ♪ ♪ You make me sweat ♪ ♪ And there's something that my body can't forget ♪ ♪ You make me sweat ♪ ♪ My body's on fire but I'm dripping wet ♪ ♪ Got a hell of a fever whenever you're around ♪ ♪ When my breath gets short ♪ ♪ My hearts starts to pound ♪ ♪ I can't control what I'm thinking about ♪ ♪ 'Cause I always remember our first workout ♪ ♪ It's dripping from my forehead ♪ ♪ It's beading on my brow ♪ ♪ I've used up all my body it's too late to stop it now ♪ ♪ You make me sweat ♪ ♪ And there's something that my body can't forget ♪ ♪ You make me sweat ♪ ♪ My body's on fire but I'm dripping wet ♪ (audience applauding) - [Announcer] Thank you Debby, your test results are 10, nine, 10.

Doctors Peters and Gruss would like to schedule an appointment for further evaluation at your earliest convenience. - Have you ever thought about going to see a past life therapist? - Uh, no way. I mean if I found out that I was someone like Catherine the Great or someone like that, then I wouldn't be able to live with myself. - Well the way I see it, it wasn't her fault she died an ignoble death. I mean I think that it was the product of poor structurous engineering. (clattering) - [Announcer] Dr. Cleo Theraidus please report to the rectal lab for an emergency marital aid recovery operation.
