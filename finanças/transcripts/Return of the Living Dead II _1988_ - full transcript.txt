All right. Good. Now you get to be a member of the club. That's okay, I'm not the joiner type. You wouldn't want a guy like me. We already voted. You're in. What do you know. Do you want to see the clubhouse? Uh... I've got homework. My sister... Too scared? Me, scared? [chuckles] [sighs] [footsteps] [iron gate creaking] Well, what do you think? Oh, uh, a little old-fashioned for my taste. Burial, I mean. I'm more into stuff like, you know, cremation. We scatter the ashes out of the plane, throw them in the ocean, have your favorite music playing. Okay, okay. Come on. [Billy] There it is. That's the clubhouse? - Wanna make something of it? - No, it's great. Okay then, come on. [Jesse] Hey, wait a second. - Who's buried in here? - Come on, I'll show you inside. Uh, I really gotta get back. My sister... We got a meeting. - Thought you weren't scared. - That was before. Initiation time. [grunting] [Johnny] Hey, look at this. [Billy and Jesse grunting] Jeez. [Johnny] What do you think? - Don't know. Might be supplies. - What kind of? [Billy] I don't know. Ammo, maybe, combat stuff. Hey, check this out. I don't think you should play around with that. Shut up, wimp. - Finders keepers, right? - Yeah. [Johnny and Billy grunting] Hey. [hissing] [all gasp] [all scream] It's the Army! The real one! This is serious! You gotta call that number...! You're not gonna tell anyone about this, see? Know why? [Jesse] Let me out! [Billy] Because you won't be able to. [Jesse] Let me out! [gasps] Ah, here we are. Oh, creep me out! Joey, are you sure that you wanna do this? Guy offered me 100 for a night's work. I can't turn that down, can I? [crow calls in the distance] Grab the bag, will you, kid? You gonna be in there all night or what? A couple of hours, tops. You wait here. Gee, that sounds really exciting. Take it easy, baby. No sweat. I don't wanna take it easy, Joey. I wanna go out and have fun. So will you just hurry up? Okay. [sighs] And will you be careful too, please? Goddamn mushy stuff. [Joey] Come on. [bird cawing] What if somebody wants to know what we're doing? Tell them you're a gravedigger. You'll be telling the truth. Only difference is, we're the kind that takes them out instead of putting them in, see? [laughs] Jesus, Ed. What do you do with them? There are all sorts of crazies out there. They want the skulls from interred bodies. That's the key, see? They gotta have been interred. Nobody wants skulls that haven't been buried. How are they gonna know the difference? It'd be dishonest to give them skulls that weren't buried. Jesus. [grunts] Whoa. [cracking sound] [screams] [gasps] You're okay. Okay, just a little decayed matter. Nothing to get unhinged about. Oh, shit! [Ed talking indistinctly] Lousy kids are always poking around in my gardens. Stay cool. - Look at that. - Oh, what the hell? [gasps] Hey, kid, I catch you in here again, I kick your ass and then I call the police! Guess I've just got a way with kids, huh? [laughs] Aw, what a shame. It's not even ripe.

[doorbell rings] I've gotta see Billy, please. He's not feeling well. I put him to bed. - But I've got his homework. - Well, you can give it to me. No. I mean, I've got to show it to him, or he won't understand! All right, but just for a few minutes. Billy? What do you want? [coughs] What happened? What did you...? Below normal. Are you keeping this under your tongue? You do feel cold. I told you not to run around in the rain. You opened that thing, didn't you? Say anything about this and your ass is grass. [Billy's mom] Jesse, that's all now. You shut up about this, or else. [low growl] Brains! Brains! I want your brains. [gasping] Brains. Brains. [Jesse grunts] [gasping] [grunts] Ah. Joey? Okay. Okay.
