My name, Noriko, was given to me by my father. "Nori" stands for "century" as in the twenty-first century... and "ko" stands for child. It seems that my father gave me this name to say that... I'm a child of this day and age. When I was little... I was an introvert who kept to myself. -Noriko! -Come play with us. -Come on, Noriko... -Come down and play with us... So... my mother would often read to me. What's up, Noriko? Read this to me, Mummy. Sure, let's read it over there. -My mother was always kind and cheerful. -Come here. Let's begin. "The Fourteen Forest Mice and the Summer Laundry Day." -Hooray! -Yay! Crybaby Noriko! Are you okay? Are you crying? No way! Are you really crying? Here, you can use my handkerchief. You can use mine too. Or mine! Whenever I was feeling down, she'd cheer me up. What is that? I loved my mother dearly. I felt so safe next to her. Yet... there was once when I really broke her heart. "Quiz tournament Female contestant: Suzuki Noriko" -Why her? -Why her of all people? Suzuki reads a lot. I'm sure she's good at quizzes. -Sir! -Yes, Takahashi. I think Yamazaki or Matsumoto would be a much better choice. I vote for Takahashi. I second that. -Sir! -Yes, Tanaka. I vote for Suzuki. In our social studies test, she could name all the prefectural capitals correctly. All right. Suzuki will be our female representative. -What about the male representative? -Me...! Okay... I got it. Knock it off, boys! That's wonderful. -We must practise for the quiz then. -Sure... I have a riddle for you. A box without hinges, key, or lid, yet golden treasure inside is hid. -Me! I know the answer! -Yes, Masao. The answer is me! And my golden treasure is love. Love? That's really profound. But that's the wrong answer. My other golden treasure is my dream. What I want to be when I grow up. Do you want to know what that is? A baseball player, right? It's either that or a magician. Really? Which will you become? I hope you become a professional baseball player. -What about you, Mum? -I'll be happy either way. -I know the answer! -Yes, Noriko? -The answer is an egg. -That's correct! You're a genius! That's awesome! We'll be there to cheer you on. Will you be able to take time off, hubby? It shouldn't be a problem since it's during the day. You don't have to come. I might get a stomach ache. You're not planning on chickening out at the last minute, are you? Stop it, Masao! Cut it out... -Let's have dinner. -Masao! "Akutagawa Award-winning Novels" -Noriko, what about this one? -I've read that. -What about this then? -I've read that one too. I see. Mum? There's a hero, a villain and side characters in every story, right? That's right. I don't want to be a villain, I think I'd like to be a side character. Noriko, how many books do you think there are here? There's more than just one story. There are countless stories out there. And we'll need just as many heroes. You're the heroine of your story. There's nothing to worry about. You can do it. Everything will be just fine. "1999 Takashima Friendship Fiesta" Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much...! Coming up next, we'll have the third grade quiz tournament. Kaifu Toishiki, Miyazawa Kiichi, Hosokawa Morihiro, Hata Tsutomu... Oh no, who's the next prime minister? You know, the one with shaggy eyebrows... -Murayama Tomiichi. -That's the one! Gee, I'm so nervous I have to pee again! Are you okay, Suzuki? No stomach ache? Back out if you're not up to it. I think you shouldn't answer any of questions. But why? You don't want to stand out, do you? You'll feel self-conscious. Right? Right...? You hear me? Let's go. Please welcome the contestants with a warm round of applause. "Third Grade Quiz Tournament" Noriko! -Do your best! -Good luck. Without further ado, we shall begin with the quiz.

Team Four. Answer it, Suzuki. Please answer the question. -Ehime? -Unfortunately, that's the wrong answer. -Team One. -It's located in Matsuyama. That's correct. -You've grown heavier since last week. -How so? -Why didn't you answer any of the questions? -I didn't know the answers. You must've known a few of them. I wasn't sure. It's okay to make mistakes. What matters is you're willing to try. I'm content to just be a side character. Noriko, listen to me. You have a future. You can be anything that you want to be. You have enormous potential. What about you, Mum? Are you leading your dream life? Are you satisfied with your current life? Please. Don't expect anything from me. I'm sorry. Come to think of it... I may have been searching... for the right thing to say to my mother since. "Birthday Card" "Birthday Card" Good grief! I told you, no running in the hospital! Sorry! -Hello there, Noriko. -Hello. -Here to visit your mother? -Yes. That's a good kid. Don't you have school today? -It's Sunday today. -Oh, it is? She'll be delighted to see you. You'd better be on your way then. Okay. -Hello, there. -Hello, Mum. First of all... -Here are your pyjamas. -Thank you. And your towel. And... What's that? -Are you ready? -They're awesome. Masao drew that. This is my drawing. You're both so good at drawing. This is so cute. -What are these? -These? They're earrings. They're so lovely. Noriko, "Attack 25" has started. "Attack 25 Panel Quiz" "Time to tackle the questions and get the twenty-five panels." "Hello, everyone. I'm Kodama Kiyoshi." "I'm Sawaki Mikako. I'll be reading your questions."

Do you think I'll win if I take part in the quiz? If you win, we'll get to go on a trip abroad. Go for it, Mum. -Maybe I should. -Please... I'll give it a shot when I'm better. -I'll send in your application. -Sure. Send it in for me. Awesome! What are you so excited about, Noriko? -Noriko says... -No! It's our secret. Okay. It's time to drain the fluids. Please get ready. Okay. Thank you. -Does it hurt? -No, I'm okay. Thank you. -See you later. -See you. -Shall we go? -Yes, please. Dad, when is Mum coming home? In a little while more. What's that deep sigh for? Mum won't be coming home. Why won't she? She will, won't she? -No, she won't. -Yes, she will. -She won't! -She will! Noriko. Mum's disease can't be cured. Right, Dad? Mum won't... That's not true! She's lying, right? Your mum's disease... can be cured. Liar! I'm sorry. It can't be help. You've always been such a bad liar. You held out longer than I expected. I'm sorry. Hey. Let's have a picnic on Noriko's birthday. A picnic outside? Will you be able to manage? I'll decide how much time I have left. I want to be smiling in front of them. I want to stay strong in front of them. I want them to see me smiling. I refuse to let them see me suffering. I won't let this illness beat me. Dad, where does this go? Isn't that too heavy for you? -Here, peel this for me. -Okay. Watch your fingers. Hold it like this. -Is Masao doing okay? -I'm doing just fine! Leave it to me! I can do this. Can you manage? -It's done! -Wow, it looks delicious! -It does! -Noriko, bring your plate closer. -This looks more like a potato stew. -More, please. More? Here you go. It looks good... -I want a heaping pile. -A heaping pile? Okay. -It's yummy! -Delicious. Of course it is. -Happy birthday! -Happy birthday! Here, my present to you. It's lovely! -Do you like it? -I love it! This is for you. Thank you. "Noriko, happy tenth birthday!" This is beautiful! Noriko. I promise I'll overcome this illness. I'll do my best. -Really? -Yes. So, you'll write me a card on my eleventh birthday too? Sure, on your twelfth and thirteenth birthdays as well. What about me? I'll write to you too. I promise. You'll both get a card from me every year on your birthdays... until you're all grown up. Do you promise to read my card? -I do! -I do! Thank you. Be careful! You made them a promise. Now, what should I write to them? -Good afternoon! -Good afternoon! I'm home! I'm home. Dad, I'm home! I'm home! I said, I was home. Did you hear me? I did. I just woke up. Let me brush my teeth first. -Come on. Hurry up, Dad! -Let me freshen up... -Hurry up, Dad! -I'm home! I'm home, Mum. I did my best at my sports meet today. Good morning. Now... did Mummy send you card? It's here! She really wrote to you! "To eleven-year-old Noriko" Congratulations! See? I told you she'd keep her promise. No, I'll read it alone! Wait up, I want to read it too! Masao! Come on, give her some space! -No... you can't come in! -Masao, stop it! Noriko, happy eleventh birthday! How are you doing? Are you and Masao getting along? Is Daddy a better cook now? I'm sorry I can't be with you. I really am. But I'll always... be watching over you from where I am. I'll send you a card every year until you turn twenty. I hope you'll look forward to them. "Riddle Corner" My eye is dark and my mane is yellow. I'm taller than most fellows. What am I? Masao! Grow these seeds into beautiful flowers in our garden. Noriko. Did Mum become a star? Yes, she did. So this card come from the stars? Yes, I'm sure it did. Maybe it came from between those clouds? You might be right. -Do you see it? -Yes. It looks like a huge cloud... but it's actually made up of a hundred billion stars. Hurry up...! Don't be so impatient, Masao. Put your eye closer. Wow, there are so many stars! I've received a card every year on my birthday since. For my twelfth birthday... she gave me a marvellous recipe for chocolate muffins. "And then you're done!" I made some chocolate muffins. Have one. It made me very popular in class. -It looks so tasty! -It looks great! For my thirteenth birthday... my mum suggested that I skip school and catch a movie alone. "Shinsei Theatre" I was taken aback by the card I received on my fourteenth birthday. Noriko. Happy fourteenth birthday! How is junior high coming along? Is there a boy that you caught your fancy? Have you had your first kiss already? If not, I'll give you some tips. Kissing tip number one. Make sure you don't have bad breath. How much longer are you going to brush your teeth? -For another thirty minutes. -I need to brush my teeth too! -Masao, you're getting in the way. -You're in mine. Hey! Noriko, your gums are bleeding. What happened? Ouch. Kissing tip number two. Look up at him adoringly. -Noriko, bring me the ketchup. -Sure. -It's different from what we had so far. -Yeah. Here you go. Kissing tip number three. Remember, practice makes perfect. Noriko, could you lend me your... Dad! Noriko has gone crazy! Kissing tip number four. Find yourself a decent boy. The summer holidays will begin tomorrow. I've been repeating myself every year. Take care of your health... and be careful not to get sick. I don't want anyone getting a heatstroke. Plan your time well so you can finish your homework in time. -Can we meet later after school? -Sure. There's something I'd like to discuss with you. Okay. Suzuki, are you listening? I'm not listening, sir. Me neither! -Me neither! -I'm going to cry. I'm serious! What? -Who asked you out? -Yoshikawa from Class E. So, what are you going to do? Are you going to go out with him? -I've already given him an answer! -Seriously? I told him I liked him too. Congratulations. Don't tell anyone or the whole school will find out. Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me. I'm sorry, Noriko. I know we made plans for the coming summer holidays, but... I see. That's perfectly understandable. I'm totally fine with this. You should give priority to him. I may not be able to go with you to the summer festival. Don't worry about it. My brother has been begging me to take him. So this works out for me too. Really? What a relief! I was feeling so bad about it. Actually, Yoshikawa is waiting for me. I'd better run. Bye! Bye. I'm home! That's a close fight. Masao, do you want to go to the summer festival tonight? Why? I can take you. What? No way. I'm going with Yosuke and the rest. I don't want to be seen with you. It's embarrassing. I'll kill you. God, I'm dying of boredom. Hello. Hello. Your sunflowers are beautiful. Your garden is always so well kept. Well done, Noriko. Thank you. By the way, Noriko, do you have some time to spare? Yes, plenty, in fact. This obi belt was Yoshie's. -It was my mum's? -Yes. She gave it to my daughter Yuki about ten years ago. I see. Here, you're all set. You look great in it. How about this? There's shaved ice over there. Yes, there are so many stalls here. Fried noodles? I want to have some octopus balls. -Let's have both then. -Shall we? -Suzuki? -No way! What are you doing here, Tateishi? I'm working part-time to help out a friend. -Is this your friend? -Well, yes... Would you like to have some? But... Jun, you can go for your break. -May I give my friend a tray for free? -Your friend? It's okay. "Octopus balls, 500 yen a tray" -Sure. -Give me a minute. Okay. Noriko. I'm a little tired. I'll go over there for some rest. Okay? -Here. -Thank you. I'll tuck in then. -It's hot! -Here, drink this. It's delicious but... it tastes different somehow. There aren't any octopus in it. Oh, so that's why. We ran out of octopus so I substituted it with konjac jelly. Goes pretty well, don't you think? I think this tastes better. Really? I'm glad you like it. -You're amazing. -Why? You've already started working part-time. There's something which I'd like to buy. What's that? -A bike. -Do you have a licence? Of course not. I have to wait until I turn sixteen. Don't you know that? I don't. Most girls won't know that. Have you been on a bike before? -No. -I'll take you for a ride... after I get my license. You look nice in a yukata. Thank you. Kissing tip number five. Grab the chance when it comes. -Suzuki, you have seaweed on your lips. -What? -And your gums are bleeding. -No way! What should I do? Suzuki? Is something wrong? No, nothing. Noriko. Happy seventeenth birthday! How is school? Are you keeping up with your studies? Are you getting along with your friends? Actually, I have a favour to ask of you. "Shodo Island Ferry" -Are you Noriko? -Yes. I'm so glad you made it. -I'm Ishii. -I'm Suzuki. This way, please. The time capsule my class buried in our junior high school days... will be dug out this year during the Obon holiday. Please be there on my behalf. Look for my classmate, Ishii Saori. I'm sure she'll take good care of you. Saori was my best friend. -Hurry! -Noriko, welcome to Shodo Island. -Cheers! -Cheers! Cheers... I'm so glad you called. I'd have completely forgotten about the time capsule, if not for you. Is that so? This is why Yoshie was our student president. No way! My mum was the student president? Yes, and I was the vice-president. There were less than twenty students in the entire grade though. It feels surreal to be drinking with Yoshie's daughter. You had a crush on Yoshie, didn't you? Look who's talking, Shimizu. You asked her out in the second year of junior high. No way! You did? I sure did. So what happened? She told me we were just friends. She said what? Just friends? That's hilarious! Shut it! Yoshie was such a pretty girl. She excelled in her studies and she was the student president. Oh, I almost forgot. Here. Is this from our graduation trip? This sure brings back the memories! You were so thin back then! Hey, I'm still thin! Why didn't Mum go on the trip? -She never told you? -No, she didn't. Yoshie boycotted the trip. She boycotted it? But why? Well, it's complicated. -Shall we switch to drinking shochu? -Shochu? Coming right up. -Thanks! -Thank you! -Have more food, Noriko. -I will. -Hello? -How's your mum's hometown? I don't know yet but it seems like a nice place. Dad, you know what? Mum was amazing. How so? She had excellent grades. She was the student president and was popular among the guys. I see. I can imagine. Does her blood really run in me? You are who you are. Don't get hung up on that. Why did Mum ask me to come here? I think she wanted you... to experience the island she grew up on. Right, dear? Experience the island? We're digging up the time capsule tomorrow. Sure. Thank you...! I'll be back in five minutes. He said he'd be back in five minutes. Let her sleep until he comes back then. It's unlike Saori to drink so much. Maybe she has a lot of stress bottled up. Shall we continue drinking? I heard that Saori and my mum were close friends. They were practically joined at the hip. At least until the graduation trip. We were supposed to go to Tokyo for our graduation trip. Not Kyoto? Oh yes, you're right! Saori and Yoshie decided on Tokyo at the students' meeting. They were bent on climbing the Tokyo Tower. But a month before the trip, the teachers changed it to Kyoto. Why did they do that? They claimed the hotels in Tokyo were too expensive. What really happened was the principal made a deal with his travel agency friend... and changed the destination at his own discretion. He awarded the contract to his friend's agency in return for kickbacks. That's a crappy thing to do. I heard that sly fox is now the director of an NPO in Osaka or something. Really? -That's what I heard. -So you don't know for sure? So Saori and Yoshie said they'd boycott the trip unless it's to Tokyo. We were convinced they'd actually do it. I was surprised when Saori showed up on the day of our departure. Your mother was left behind all by herself. So in a way, Saori had double-crossed Yoshie. I think the car's back. -Are you okay? -Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. Take care. -Good night. -All right. See you then. Let's go, Noriko. Maho...! Open up! There's someone I want you to meet, so open up! Just give me a minute. Sorry about earlier. You shouldn't have to see that. Don't worry about it. My daughter is in junior high... but she has been shutting herself up in her room. It's been six months now. I don't know what happened at school, but... Noriko, if you don't mind, would you talk to her for me? -What? -Please. Her name is Maho. She used to be a cheerful girl with lots of friends. Sorry... but I'm not good at that kind of thing... I'm sorry. What was I thinking? Please forget about it. Good morning. Good morning. -Are these tea leaves? -Yes. Olive tea leaves. I'll fix you breakfast. May I give it a go? -What? -I'd like to try picking tea leaves. Would you like to try? If so, go get changed. -Yes. -Follow me. Yoshie used to help me out too. I'm... different from my mother. I'm nothing like her. Have you heard about the graduation trip? Yes. Actually... Yoshie and I wanted to go to Tokyo on our school trip... for an entirely different reason. What was it? -Do you know the girl band, "Pink Lady"? -Yes. Their farewell concert at the Korakuen Hall... was scheduled to be held at the same time as our school trip. We were ardent fans. You and Mum? They were the biggest girl band back then. As big as "Morning Musume" is today. Is that why you girls were so bent on going to Tokyo? That's right. So when it was changed to Kyoto, we decided to boycott the trip. We were going to get our deposit back... so that we could take the bullet train to Tokyo together. Really? We would have done so... had I not betrayed her. My parents begged me in tears not to boycott the trip. I couldn't keep my promise to Yoshie. I really wanted to go to Pink Lady's farewell concert. I wanted to apologise to Yoshie. I'm tucking in. -Help yourself to the food. -I will. I'm going out now. Can you manage alone? Do you know the way? -Yes. -Okay. Take your time then. Call me if you need anything. Maho, this is Noriko. Hello. She's my friend's daughter. Oh, I borrowed this. What the hell? You're the worst. I can't believe this. Take it off now! -Maho...! -Wait, hold on... -I'll take it off! Just give me a second. -Maho! I took a shower before I put it on. "Song of Sakura" I know this band. They disbanded, right? They're the "Ginnan Boyz" now. That's their new band. I know this song. -Which one? -This one. -Would you like to listen to it? -Sure. -Do you want to see the lyrics? -Yes, please. -Here you go. -Thank you. -Which track is it? -It's track number ten. What's this? It's amazing. Wow, it's awesome. Pull it up...! "Twenty-ninth Graduating Class of Shodo Island Junior High" Okay! Stop! Open it...! -What's this? -I have more. -Here. -Wow. -I've read it twice. -Twice? Wow, awesome! Ready? "Twenty-ninth Graduating Class of Shodo Island Junior High" Saori, this is yours. Listen. About your mum... be good to her. I know. It's not... my mum's fault. Oh no! -Maho, may I borrow your bicycle? -Sure. Thank you! Sorry, I'm late! -Here you go. -Thank you. "Miyazawa Yoshie" -I'm going to open it. -Go ahead. "Farewell, Pink Lady" -No way! -Mum went for the concert. Are you sure about this? I'd like you to have it. Thank you. "I'm sorry, Saori." Yoshie... I'm sorry. Mum! "The ferry bound for Himeji is about to depart soon." "Passengers bound for Himeji, please board the ferry now." I can never be like my mum. I don't have the courage to boycott a school trip... or go to Tokyo by myself. I just can't do it. Noriko, you have your own strengths. "Shodo Island Ferry Terminal" Take care. Thank you for having me. -Here's a little something for you. -Thank you. Wait! Maho? I made a mix CD for you. Thank you so much. I'll send you one too. Let's go for karaoke together someday. And we'll sing songs by "Pink Lady." Why? No particular reason. Sure. I'll listen to Mum's CDs and practise. I'll teach you the moves. Great. Thank you. See you! Maho! Thank you! -See you again! -I'll visit again! -Bye! -Bye! Thank you! It looks delicious. -Let's tuck in. -Let's tuck in. "To nineteen-year-old Noriko" How was it? What did Mum write in this year's card? Masao, I'll be away for my club's camping trip next week. What? Who's going to cook for me then? I'll stock the fridge with frozen food. But I'll be too tired from school to make myself dinner. At least get me takeout. Back to your birthday card. Do you have to go somewhere again this year? I didn't read it. Oh, you haven't read it? I've decided not to read this year's birthday card. Why not? Because I don't want to be told what to do. What's that supposed to mean? Are you serious? What's wrong, Noriko? I don't have to read it right away. The whole point is to read it on your birthday. Mum wrote it specially for your nineteenth birthday. Stop being such a nag. It's none of your business. Why don't you read it first and then decide what to do afterwards? No, I'm not reading it. Why not? I'm tired of letting Mum run my life. I don't see why I've to be forced to do something every year. Last year, I had to cancel my plans with my friends... because Mum wanted me to do volunteer work. But you said you learnt a lot from it. I may have said that, but I'd have preferred to stick to my own plans. It threw me off my exam preparations as well. I don't want to be tied down by Mum anymore. Why do I have to be bossed around by someone who's not even here? Put yourselves in my shoes for once! What? Apologise to your mother. Why should I? Apologise to her. If you want me to do that... bring her to me. Suzuki? What? It's been a while. Tateishi? I haven't seen you since we graduated from junior high school. What are you doing out here? Well... I'm taking a walk. Suzuki. Are you hungry? Grab a seat. -Do you work here? -Yes. -I'm an apprentice. -An apprentice? I hope to learn enough to open my own shop someday. I see. Here you go. I'm tucking in. Here. It's hot! -Here, have some water. -Thank you. It's delicious. I'm so glad you like it. Thank you for the food. It was really good. I'm glad you liked it. Suzuki! What happened earlier? You were crying, weren't you? I had a fight with my dad. Oh, I didn't expect that from you. We don't usually quarrel. I envy you. I don't have a dad. What? Oh, I guess the subject never came up when we were in school. I'm from a single-parent family. I see. I can never fight with my mum. Why not? She has been working so hard to raise my brother and me. Wow, look at that. Thank you for the ride. I'm glad I could keep my promise to you. I promised you in junior high that... I'd take you for a ride once I got my licence. You remembered. Yeah, sort of. Bye. -Here. -Come to our restaurant again. -I'll call you. -Sure. See you then. "To nineteen-year-old Noriko" Happy nineteenth birthday. And I'm sorry. I have to start off with an apology. Truth be told, your father and I had a fight yesterday. Because I ripped up one of my birthday cards to you. I've lost the confidence to write to you. Yoshie. What are you doing? This is stupid. I'm throwing everything away. That's foolish... What do you think you're doing? No... stop! I'm sorry! Are you okay? I don't know... I don't know what Noriko will be like when she turns nineteen. I can't picture the things she might be struggling with. Hey. Why won't I get to see her? Why won't I get to see my daughter when she's nineteen? Or when she turns twenty? Why? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yoshie. Even so, you have to keep on writing. You promised her you would. Write and tell her how you're feeling right now. Just tell her honestly you can't imagine what she's like at nineteen years old. Who'd be happy to get such a letter? You don't know that. Noriko might be glad just to receive something from you. It could make her day. No one knows what she'll be like when she turns nineteen. So, please don't stop writing to Noriko or Masao. A simple message will do. Just write to them. Please. And that's why you're reading about this right now. If you have any complaints about it, take it up with your father. There's one thing I do want you to know No matter what you may be like when you turn nineteen... I'll always love you. There's only one more letter left for me from Mum. That'll be 3,655 yen in all. -Welcome. -Good afternoon. -It's a hot day today. -It sure is. Masao! Go...! Masao! Come on! Masao! I'm sorry! That slob. Masao! I told you to shake the dust off your uniform... before putting it in the laundry basket. I'm sorry. You seem to be all fired up even though you're just a benchwarmer. I'd appreciate it if you'd call me a reserve player. Will you be competing for the best four if you win the next game? If we win, we'll have a chance at the nationals. -Thank you for the game. -Thank you for the game. Your team lost by a point? That was so close. But you did well. You tried your best. Right? The bath is ready. No more baseball practice, I'm a free man. -A regular portion, please. -Okay, here you go. You're making a mess! Be more careful, will you, Dad? Isn't that too much vegetables? -Yes, Dad. Where's all the gravy? -There's practically no gravy. -It's fine. How much do you want? -An extra scoop. Come on... time for lunch. Yes. -Okay. I'm tucking in. -I'm tucking in. Is it any good? It's delicious! Yes, it's good. -Happy birthday! -Happy birthday! Thank you. -You're finally twenty. -She's twenty already? This is your mother's last letter to you. Thank you. "To twenty-year-old Noriko" Here you go. Noriko, happy twentieth birthday. It's been ten years since you received the first birthday card. Through writing these letters to you... I feel as though I have been a part of your last ten years. Thank you. I've had a wonderful time. Ten years ago, or rather, a few days ago as it is for me... you asked me a question to which I had no answer. I'd like to answer that question now. What about you, Mum? Are you leading your dream life? Are you satisfied with your current life? My life didn't work out as planned. I have countless regrets and things which I wish I had done. But I can proudly say that I'm contented with my life. I am very thankful... to have met your father... and to be blessed with Masao and you. Thank you for reading my letters. Goodbye, Noriko. -Thank you. -Thank you very much. The noodles are ready. -Can you cope? -Yes, sir. -Welcome. -Sorry to have kept you waiting. It looks great. The extra egg and seaweed are complimentary. Wow, thank you. He's a hard worker. -Okay. -One Shishi-ramen, please. One Shishi-ramen coming right up. I can see that. This is lovely! I'm glad you like it. -It looks good. -Yes. And... here. You said you missed getting a letter from your mother on your birthday. So I wrote you one. It's nothing much though. "Let's continue to get along!" -It's really brief. -I didn't know what to write. Thank you. I'll go get changed. "Another contestant has taken the lead. We'll move on to the last question." "He was an American scholar who studied Japanese literature..." "and won the Order of Culture in 2008." -It's Donald Keene. -"White." "Donald Keene." -That's the answer we were looking for! -Yes! You're amazing. I used to watch this show with my mum when I was a kid. So you like quizzes? Actually, not really. Why? I was chosen as a contestant in a quiz tournament... when I was in elementary school. But I didn't answer a single question. Why not? Because I was weak and scared. Even now, I still wish I have a chance... to relive that day so I could do things differently. -You can do that. -How? -By participating in "Attack 25." -What? Win the game and take me on the Mediterranean cruise. "Successful contestants stand to win tickets for a Mediterranean cruise." "To ABC TV 'Attack 25' Committee" "Name: Suzuki Yoshie Age: Thirty-three" I love the orange suit. -What about the buttons? -The buttons... how about red? Okay. And his tie? It'll be lime green. Sounds great! -I wonder if he'll read our postcard? -I'm sure he will. "ABC TV 'Attack 25' Committee" The qualifying test for "Attack 25" is said to be as difficult as... the entrance exams of prestigious universities. Candidates who passed the test will stay on for an interview. An interview? That's not really my forte... Vitamin C? -"Vitamin A." -"That's correct!" I see, it's Vitamin A. "Vitamin A." -I'm home. -Welcome home. I'm sorry. I'll fix dinner now. Don't worry about it. I can fix dinner once in a while. "Attack 25"! "'Attack 25!' Preliminary Round Notification" Noriko! You've received the notification for the preliminary round. "'Attack 25' preliminary round" The test paper and pen are on your desk. -Quick! Hide the festive red rice. -Hide it... You shouldn't have served the rice. Get the white rice. We need to keep these. Oh crap, the streamers too. I graduated from university... and found a job in my hometown. Masao failed his university entrance exams three times. So did I... with the "Attack 25" preliminary rounds. "Study notes for 'Attack 25'!" "Attack 25 Panel Quiz" What's up with that outfit? Are you going camping? I'm going on a trip. What trip? I'm going on a road trip! I'll tour Japan on my bicycle. What are you talking about? That's what Mum wrote in her letter. Look. "Try travelling when you're lost in life." Are you sure this is what she meant by that? A man should venture out at least once in his life, right? That's not how I interpret it. Anyway, have you told Dad about this? Yes, I did, like a man. What did you say? University is not for me, but I'm not ready to find a job yet. So I'll do a bit of travelling first. You're quite a piece of work, aren't you? -He disapproved. -Of course he did. He said he had failed as a father. He even cried a little. Tell him to take care, will you? See you. When will you be back? Well, in about a year or two, I suppose. I knew it! Masao! Don't look for me! Dad! Are you okay? I'm sorry, Noriko! Don't come after me! See you, guys! Call us, okay? You idiot! "'Attack 25' preliminary round" I shall now announce the list of candidates who passed the test. Candidate number five, Mr Nosaka. I did it! Please go for your interview after this. -Candidate number ten, Miss Tamura. -Yes! Candidate number sixteen, Miss Suzuki. Yes. Congratulations. -Thank you. -Candidate number twenty-one, Mr Kato. Please have a seat. -Are you Miss Suzuki Noriko? -Yes. Noriko? I'm sorry. There are two contestants with the same surname. Oh, I see. And you're Miss Noriko. All right. My name, Noriko, was given to me by my father. "Nori" stands for "century" as in the twenty-first century... and "ko" stands for child. It seems that my father gave me this name to say that... I'm a child of this day and age. I feel out of place here. We could have just gone to our usual hangout. No, that won't do. We're here to celebrate today. Noriko, congratulations on passing the written test. Thank you. Congratulations to you on your promotion to store manager. Thank you very much. I'm so happy for you. How was your interview? I was a nervous wreck. When will you know the outcome of the interview? They say they'll inform me soon. I wonder if I made it. I'm sure you did fine. I just told them my honest feelings. Noriko. May I confess my honest feelings to you as well? What? Yes, I see. All right. Thank you very much. Bye. I'm home. Noriko! Yes? Congratulations! What? How did you know...? You made it! You've qualified for "Attack 25"! Really? I did it! -You did it! -Yes, I did it...! What is the headmaster's nickname in Natsume Soseki's novel, "Botchan"? -Is it Racoon? -That's correct! Yes! There's a taxi. -Dad, come on. -The taxi's here. Did Osaka use to be this hot? -Sorry to keep you waiting. -I'm coming... "Attack 25" -Noriko! -Maho! -It's been so long! -Thank you for coming. All the best to you. -Are you a contestant? -Yes, I'm Suzuki. -Ms Suzuki Noriko? -Yes. And these are your supporters? I'm her father and these are her friends. Please wait here. -Noriko, this way please. -Okay. -I'm going in then. -Good luck. Good luck. You can do it. Do your best. You too. "Attack 25" "Master of Ceremony, Tanihara Shosuke" Welcome to this week's edition of "Attack 25 Panel Quiz." I'm your host, Tanihara Shosuke. Today's contestants are all in their twenties. I anticipate a refreshing and lively competition ahead of us. Good luck and may the best player win the trip to the Mediterranean. Here's this week's opening question. "Hello, everyone. I'm Tanaka Kei." "I play Takanashi Ayumuya in the new drama 'Tokyo Metropolitan Police Team 0'..." "which airs tonight at nine." "I'll be giving you hints on..." "a tool used in police investigations." "Hint number one" "It's used in a crime laboratory." "Hint number two, it measures and records biological responses..." Green. "Hayase Airi, Fukushima" A polygraph. Excellent! That's right. "Airi all the way!" Green has taken its first panel. The next question will be given by ABC announcer, Miss Kato. Good evening. I'm Kato Akiko, an ABC announcer. The following question has three options. Blue. -The question hasn't been read yet. -I'm so sorry! -Did you press it by mistake? -Yes. -It's fine. Don't worry about it. -I'm so sorry... -Just relax. -Okay. Where are your supporters? My friends and family are over there. -I see. They're your friends and family. -Noriko! Thank you. -Your sign reads "Do best your." -Oh no! I got it wrong. The gentleman in the middle, are you her father? -Yes, I'm her father. -I see. And is the young lad next to you family too? -Well, I'm... -He's her friend. What was that awkward silence? -So he's not family. I see. -Yes. Well, not family but more than just a friend, perhaps? Please do your best to support her. Miss Kato, the question, please. "Known for its beautiful swirl..." "it is named after the face-on spiral galaxy M101 in the Big Dipper..." Blue. A pinwheel firework. Excellent! Way to go, Noriko! The common Kanji character used for the bird, the shrike and the centipede is... Blue. -The Kanji character, "hundred." -That's right! Bravo! What a pity, Green and White. Blue, what's the answer? It's the Battle of Waterloo. That's right. That's the right answer. Come on, high five. Give me a five. Blue. Trench coat. That's right! It's a trench coat. Blue takes panel fifteen. -"The profit is called..." -White. "Nakano Kenta, Osaka" Capital gain! That's right! It's capital gain. -Red. -Ego. That's right! "Nozaki Shunji, Aichi" It's okay... "In the Muromachi period, it was performed along with Noh..." "Kyogen" (Traditional Japanese comic theatre). That's right! The answer is "Kyogen." Well done! Group. Excellent! Mori Terumoto. That's right. It's Mori Terumoto. Gregor Samsa was the lead character of this... -Blue. -"The Metamorphosis." -That's correct! -Yes! Blue takes panel ten, giving her a total of nine panels. -Well done! -Green has lost two panels. We've come to our last panel. Let's have a look at how our contestants are doing. Green occupies eleven panels and Blue has nine. If Blue manages to occupy the last panel, panel twenty-two... Green will lose six panels and Blue will gain seven panels. Blue will turn the tables on Green and win today's contest. -Well then... -Mr Suzuki. Yeah? I'd like to ask you something. What is it? I'd like to ask for Noriko's hand in marriage. What? Mr Suzuki, your daughter is doing fine. Your family is getting all fired up as well. Miss Suzuki, how do you feel right now? I'll take my chance and give it my best shot. Great. Let's have the last question. Go ahead, Miss Kato. Okay. "Akutagawa Prize has just celebrated its 153rd anniversary." "The winner of the first Akutagawa Prize is..." Blue! There's more than just one story. There are countless stories out there. And we'll need just as many heroes. You're the heroine of your story. There's nothing to worry about. You can do it. Everything will be just fine. How do you read this? "Sobo." What does it mean? It refers to those who live an earnest life and die an honest death. The nameless, faceless heroes of everyday life. People like you and me. I'm getting hungry. Shall we go home? Yes. Pop quiz for you. What are we having for dinner tonight? What? Give me a hint. It's your father's favourite dish. Dad's favourite? It's good. There's octopus inside. I like the ones you made with konjac jelly. Would you like to have one too? I'll throw that away for you. I'll go get us some drinks. What a shame. You knew the answer to the last question was "Sobo." But I just couldn't remember the author's name. I really wanted to win the game and go on that Mediterranean cruise. Noriko. You did well. I'm so proud of you. Oh, it's just a quiz show. No, I don't mean just today. I'm talking about everything you've accomplished so far. You've worked hard. Dad. Could you pat me on the head? Mr Suzuki, would you like another drink? Please take good care of Noriko. I will. Yes, I'll do my best! I'll make her happy! I can't say no to that now, can I? This is for you, Noriko. Shall we have a toast? Yes. To happiness! -Cheers! -Cheers! -Thank you. -Thank you. I'm impressed you nailed that one. It was half luck and half intuition. You really have the flair for this game. Miss Hayase is this week's winner. I did it! Miss Suzuki, you were so close. -May I give a shout-out to my brother? -Sure, please go ahead. Masao, I'm getting married. Come home! I don't know the details, but Masao... "Don't miss your sister's wedding." "See you next week on 'Attack 25.'" Noriko? -"See you then." -"See you then." -"This programme was brought to you by..." -"Congratulations." Oh no. Please hurry up! I'm going as fast as I can. Hurry up, Dad. I know... relax, Miss Bride. Hello there. -Is the taxi here? -It's waiting outside. Good morning, Mr Bridegroom. Good morning. Enough of that. We have to hurry! Is everything okay? I'll close the boot then. -We've gotten everything, right? -I think we have everything we need. Noriko, Jun. Let's take a photo to remember today by. But we're pressed for time. Let's do it. -With the sunflowers. -Okay. Wait for me! Masao? I made it! Nice to meet you. I'm Tateishi. Nice to meet you too. Congratulations. I'm Masao. Why didn't you call home? -Calm down, Dad! -Calm down, Father. Can't you be happy that I'm home? Why did you have to travel across Japan? To find my inner self. Excuse me...! Excuse me! You'll be late for the wedding. That's right. -Is everybody ready? -Yes. Say cheese! One more time. Say cheese! Come in. What do you think? Thank you, Dad. Noriko the cry-baby has grown up to become a bride today. Wow! You look amazing! That goes without saying. Actually... Mum has one more letter for you. What? It was enclosed in my last letter. She told me to give it to you on your wedding day. She didn't even tell Dad. I can't believe she didn't tell me. She did this to make sure that I'd attend your wedding. "To Noriko who's getting married today" Here you go. It's Mum's handwriting. We'll leave you to read the letter. "To Noriko who's getting married today" Noriko, congratulations on your marriage! I'm so happy for you on this very special day. It's a shame that I can't meet the groom personally. But I'm certain that the man you've chosen is a fine man. Please remember this. You have a lot of people around you who love and support you. I've raised Masao to be a caring brother, haven't I? Please. Just be yourself. Whenever you're in need, talk to him. I'm sure he'll help. You're too tense. Relax. You're too stiff. Your father... will be there for you even if the entire world turns its back on you. If you're ever in need, you know you can depend on him. You are loved by many. So always count your blessings. Cherish your husband. Live your life to the fullest and always be happy. I'm so blessed to have you as my daughter. PS: As an apology for not being able to attend your wedding... I made you a veil with all my love. -Hello there, Noriko. -Hello. -Here to visit your mother? -Yes. That's a good kid. Don't you have school today? -It's Sunday today. -Oh, it is? She'll be delighted to see you. You'd better be on your way then. Okay. Congratulations. Thank you. Noriko. I'm going out to run some errands. Would you like to come along? -Can we swing by the supermarket? -Sure. -I'll come with you then. Wait for me. -Okay. I'll be back soon.
