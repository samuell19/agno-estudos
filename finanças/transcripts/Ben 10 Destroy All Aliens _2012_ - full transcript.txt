[SCREAM] AGH! YEAH, I CAN DO THAT... [SCREAMS] IN PURSUIT OF RUNAWAY VEHICLE. PROCEEDING WEST ON PUGSLEY BOULEVARD NEAR KLINE AVENUE. WHOA, THAT'S SOME TANK, GRANDPA. IT'S NOT A TANK, DOOFUS. IT'S A FULLY AUTOMATED URBAN ASSAULT VEHICLE. YOU'RE A FULLY ANNOYING ASSAULT ON MY EYES AND EARS. YOU'RE A FULLY DISGUSTING ASSAULT ON MY NOSE. SHOWER MUCH? ONLY TO WASH OFF YOUR COOTIES. KNOCK IT OFF, YOU TWO! All: HUH? WHOAOAAA! Ben: WHOA! WHATEVER THIS THING IS, IT'S GONE COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL! WHICH MEANS IT'S HERO TIME! - HUH? - NOT ON A SCHOOL NIGHT. I PROMISED BOTH YOUR PARENTS I'D HAVE YOU HOME BY 8:00. ACCORDING TO MY WATCH, IT'S TIME FOR AN UPGRADE. HOLD UP, DWEEB! WHAT IT NEEDS IS A DISMANTLING SPELL! UPGRADE! DISMANTLING SPELL! UPGRADE! DISMANTLING SPELL! OKAY, YOU WIN. PSYCH! [GROANS] WHOA! NOT THE KIND OF UPGRADE I HAD IN MIND! MECHANAE DISCOMBOBULUS! WHOA! THIS IS NOT GOOD! WHOA, UNH, OOH, UHH, WHOA... WHOA! UH...OOPS? GRANDPA! YOU ALL RIGHT? A FEW MORE INCHES AND I WOULDN'T BE. Both: THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT! Both: MY FAULT? HOW IS IT MY FAULT? YOU'RE THE PEA-BRAIN WHO UPGRADED THAT ASSAULT VEHICLE! WELL, YOU'RE THE NIMROD WHO HIT ME WITH A DISMANTLING SPELL! KNOCK IT OFF, BOTH OF YOU. THE POINT IS, THE DANGER'S OVER AND EVERYONE'S FINE. FINE! - FINE! - FINE! [SIGHS] NOW LET'S GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE YOU CAUSE ANY MORE DAMAGE. GWEN? GRANDPA? WHERE IS EVERYBODY? GRANDPA? HEATBLAST? WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING ME? WAIT, YOU ARE ME. HMM? RAHH! FOUR ARMS? HAHH! WHAT IS THIS? THE OMNITRIX'S GREATEST HITS LIVE? YAHHH! OR IS THIS ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR STUPID MAGIC SPELLS, GWEN? [SNIFFS] [GAGS] STINKFLY! DEFINITELY DOESN'T SMELL LIKE A MAGIC SPELL. AGH! [GRUNT] DIAMONDHEAD? [GROWLS] WHOA! WILDMUTT? WHO ELSE WANTS A PIECE OF ME TODAY? UPGRADE? I HAD TO ASK. [GRUNTS] WAY BIG. WHY'D IT HAVE TO BE WAY BIG? BEN. BEN TENNYSON. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? YOUR HOMEWORK. [SNORING] THAT IS, IF YOU'D CARE TO STAY AWAKE LONG ENOUGH TO HAND IT IN. [LAUGHING] OH YEAH, HERE YOU GO. TURN OFF THAT BLASTED WATCH ALARM! AND WHERE'S THE HOMEWORK? UH...DIDN'T I JUST--? GET AN F ON YOUR HOMEWORK? YES. [LAUGHTER] - YEAH, "F" FOR YOU! - [BELL RINGS] DON'T FORGET YOUR HISTORY REPORTS ARE DUE MONDAY. WAIT, WHAT HISTORY REPORT? NEXT TIME TRY USING YOUR PLANNER FOR WRITING DOWN CLASS ASSIGNMENTS INSTEAD OF DOODLING MONSTERS. THEY'RE NOT MONSTERS. THEY'RE ALIEN HEROES. HMMM. HUH? UM...EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE. HOW ABOUT A DETENTION TO GO WITH THAT "F", MR. TENNYSON? I'M SUPPOSED TO SAVE THE WORLD, NOT DO REPORTS ON IT. [SIGH] COULD MY LIFE GET ANY WORSE? THAT'S A PRETTY TALL ORDER FOR A DWEEB LIKE YOU, TENNYSON. BUT WE'LL GIVE IT A SHOT. [LAUGHTER] HE ACTUALLY FITS IN THERE! HEY! A LITTLE HELP! ANYONE? WAIT, I KNOW WHERE I CAN GET A HAND. FOUR HANDS TO BE EXACT. HEATBLAST? OH WELL, CLOSE ENOUGH. - [FIRE ALARM RINGS] - OH, MAN... WHAT A BORING DAY! YEAH-- NOTHING EVER HAPPENS AROUND HERE! WHOA! WHY DOES THIS THING NEVER TIME OUT WHEN I WANT IT TO? [KNOCK ON DOOR] BEN! COME OUT HERE THIS INSTANT, YOUNG MAN! JUST A SEC-- [CLEARS THROAT] JUST A SECOND, DAD! BEN? HI, MOM. HI, DAD. WHAT WERE YOU DOING DOWN THERE? I, UM...WAS LOOKING FOR THIS. CAN YOU TELL ME WHY THE ENTIRE HOUSE IS COVERED IN SCORCH MARKS? I CAN EXPLAIN! ACTUALLY, I CAN'T. AND WHAT'S THIS WE HEAR ABOUT YOU FALLING ASLEEP IN CLASS? I'M AFRAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GROUND YOU, SON. BUT I'M SUPPOSED TO GO FISHING WITH GRANDPA MAX THIS WEEKEND! YOU SPENT THE ENTIRE SUMMER WITH GRANDPA. MISSING ONE WEEKEND WITH HIM WON'T BE THE END OF THE WORLD. PLEASE TELL ME IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD, GRANDPA! TELL ME THERE'S A LIFE-OR-DEATH, ALIEN-HERO-NEEDING SITUATION WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS WEEKEND. CAN'T OVERRULE YOUR PARENTS, BEN. [SIGHS] I WISH I NEVER CAME HOME FROM OUR ROAD TRIP. SUMMER CAN'T LAST FOREVER. EVERYBODY'S GOTTA GET OFF THE ROAD SOMETIME. NOT HEROES LIKE US, GRANDPA. BEN, DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I ALMOST MADE WITH YOUR FATHER. NO POINT IN SAVING THE UNIVERSE IF YOU LOSE YOUR FAMILY. "FIRST-PERSON NARRATIVE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A CREW MEMBER DURING THE AGE OF EXPLORATION." [SIGH] SHOOT ME NOW. I DIDN'T MEAN LITERALLY! AND SINCE WHEN DO YOU VAPORIZE LAPTOPS? WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU? ALL RIGHT. DESPERATE TIMES CALL FOR DESPERATE MEASURES. [RINGING] HELLO? GWEN! HOW'S MY FAVORITE COUSIN? WHAT DO YOU WANT, BEN? I DON'T NEED A REASON TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH FAMILY. IT'S JUST...IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE JUST TO SHOOT THE BREEZE WITH THE SMARTEST PERSON I KNOW. OKAY, WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH BEN? CLEVER. IN FACT, YOU'RE SO CLEVER, I BET IF I RANDOMLY PICKED A TOPIC-- SAY, THE AGE OF EXPLORATION-- YOU COULD RATTLE OFF A BUNCH OF INTERESTING FACTS, ENOUGH TO WRITE A FIRST-PERSON NARRATIVE. NICE TRY, DWEEB. BUT YOU NEED TO EXPERIENCE THE JOY OF RESEARCH YOURSELF. COME ON! DO ME THIS ONE FAVOR! NO. YOU CAN'T JUST EXPECT ALL LIFE'S ANSWERS TO JUST COME FLYING IN THROUGH THE WINDOW. RIGHT-GOTTA-GO-SMELL-YA-LATER! TETRAX? WE NEED TO TALK. I RECEIVED AN URGENT MESSAGE FROM AZMUTH. THE INVENTOR OF THE OMNITRIX? WHAT DID HE WANT? HE DID NOT SAY. ONLY THAT HE NEEDED TO MEET WITH YOU RIGHT AWAY. YES! EXCEPT I'M GROUNDED. I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE OUT OF THE HOUSE. MY FOLKS ARE GONNA KILL ME! I SEE. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT WOULD BE RUDE TO STAND UP AZMUTH. ODD. AZMUTH SAID HE WOULD MEET AT THESE COORDINATES. WAIT. AZMUTH IS COMING HERE? I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING ON A ROAD TRIP. IN SPACE. IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR OMNITRIX? NO. I THINK I'LL GO LOOK FOR AZMUTH RIGHT NOW! BEN-- WAIT! MAN, THAT WAS CLOSE. [GASPS] WHOAAA! OW. HEY! ARE YOU OKAY OVER THERE? - [CREAKING] - HUH? WHOA! [ROARS] WOW, YOU LOOK LIKE WAY BIG. ONLY WAY UGLIER. COME ON! COME ON! [STRAINS] [ROARS] TETRAX! WHERE DID THIS TO'KUSTAR COME FROM? AND WHY IS IT ATTACKING? QUESTIONS LATER! IT'S HERO TIME! WAY BIG HERO TIME! DOESN'T THIS THING EVER WORK? OH, WELL. UMPH! FIRST RULE IN BATTLE-- CONCENTRATE ON YOUR OPPONENT'S WEAK SPOT. IN THE CASE OF TO'KUSTARS, IT'S THE FRILL AT THE TOP OF THE HEAD. I'LL KEEP HIM DISTRACTED. NOW GO! [GROWLS] UNH! [GROWLS] GET READY FOR THE STING OF STINKFLY! AAAAH! NOT NOW! WHOA, WHAAAO! PLEASE RECHARGE, PLEASE RECHARGE. YES! [GROWLS] [SCREAMING] THANKS, TETRAX! NO, THANK YOU, BEN. YOU DESTROYED THE TO'KUSTAR. I DID? I MEAN, I DID! AWESOME. NOW YOU'RE VAPORIZING EVIL ALIENS. EW. ALL SET TO GO FISHING, PUMPKIN? I PACKED THE BAIT AND LUNCH. - UM...WHICH IS WHICH? - [PHONE RINGS] Y'ELLO! - DAD, IS BEN WITH YOU? - I THOUGHT HE WAS GROUNDED. HE IS. BUT HE'S GONE. YOU DON'T THINK SOMETHING'S HAPPENED TO HIM? DON'T WORRY, SON. WE'LL FIND BEN. HE CAN'T HAVE GONE TOO FAR. [SIGH] HE ALWAYS GOES TOO FAR. I FEAR THE TO'KUSTAR MAY HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH AZMUTH'S DELAY. I SHOULD CONTACT YOUR GRANDFATHER. NO! I MEAN, WE NEED TO SEARCH FOR AZMUTH. COVER THE WHOLE GALAXY IF WE HAVE TO. HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES. THIS WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOUR BEING GROUNDED, WOULD IT? DID I SAY GROUNDED BEFORE? I MEANT GROUNDED IN REALITY. LIKE A REAL HERO. WE NEED TO MAKE THE FINAL PREPARATIONS. MY WATCH IS FINE. THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION. WE HAVE A LONG JOURNEY AHEAD OF US. OH YEAH! ROAD TRIP! I'LL EXPLAIN THE NEW SETTING ONCE WE'RE IN ORBIT. YEAH! SAVING THE UNIVERSE ONCE AGAIN! THIS IS GONNA BE SO COOL! NO MORE TEACHERS! NO MORE BULLIES! NO MORE GETTING GROUNDED! AND NO MORE STUPID HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS! [EXPLOSION] WHAT IS THAT? WE'VE BEEN HIT! WHOA! - WHOAA! - BEN! TETRAX! COME ON! COME ON! WORK! YOU STUPID, USELESS, PIECE OF JUNK! OW. WELL, I WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL. NOW WHERE AM I? I CAN'T PINPOINT BEN WITH A LOCATING SPELL. THIS IS THE LAST PLACE I PICK UP ANY TRACE OF HIS ENERGY. LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS SOME KIND OF BATTLE HERE. ALIEN BATTLE. HOW'D THAT TRUCK GET HERE? UH, GRANDPA...I DON'T THINK THAT'S A TRUCK. A HOLOGRAPHIC CLOAK? WAIT. I KNOW THIS SPACESHIP. AND THAT ONE, TOO! THAT'S TETRAX'S SHIP! WE NEED TO TALK. FINALLY I CAN GET A RIDE WITHOUT FREAKING OUT THE DRIVER! HUH? HEY! WHY DIDN'T I TURN HUMAN? [GRUMBLES] WHOA! DID I JUST GO BACK IN TIME? NO. JUST RUNNING OUT OF TIME! WHO ARE YOU? ANOTHER UPGRADE? I ASK THE QUESTIONS, TETRAMAND! I'M LOOKING FOR AN ALIEN. EVER TRY PEEKING IN THE MIRROR? SILENCE! UNHH! HUH? NO FAIR TELEPORTING! [STRAINING] HEY! YOU'RE WRECKING AN ANCIENT EARTH ARTIFACT! EARTH ARTIFACT? DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE A GALVAN PRACTICAL JOKE WHEN YOU SEE ONE? WHERE'S YOUR GIANT ALIEN BUDDY? WHAT GIANT ALIEN BUDDY? [GRUNTS] DON'T PLAY DUMB, TETRAMAND! MY TRACKER LED ME STRAIGHT TO YOU! NOW WHERE IS HE? HE'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU! MAN! HOW GULLIBLE CAN YOU GET? I'M NOT FINISHED WITH YOU! [STRAINING] HA HA HA! HAHH! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME WITHOUT YOUR SHIP! [YELLS] YOU SHOT DOWN TETRAX'S SHIP? YOU SHOOT DOWN AZMUTH'S SHIP TOO? UNH! UMPH! WHA? AZMUTH? WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT AZMUTH? UHHH! ARGH! TALK OR PERISH! IS THAT LIKE TRUTH OR DARE? BATTER UP! BOY, THAT GUY DOESN'T QUIT! FINALLY! I CAN BLEND IN WITH THE OTHER HUMANS BEFORE HE TELEPORTS BACK! OH, MAN! WHERE'D THE TETRAMAND GO? BIG GUY? RED FACE? FOUR ARMS? NEVER HEARD OF HIM. THEN I'LL JUST HAVE TO INTERROGATE YOU INSTEAD-- BACK ON MY PLANET! THIS IS YOUR PLANET? NO! YOUR TAMPERING MUST HAVE CAUSED MY TELEPORTER TO MALFUNCTION. SO HOW MANY ALIENS ARE INVOLVED IN THIS? INVOLVED IN WHAT? YOU SURE THAT'S HOW YOU WANT TO PLAY IT? YOUR TETRAMAND FRIEND ALL BUT ADMITTED HE KNEW AZMUTH. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AZMUTH TOO? MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU FIND HIM. I'M AFRAID YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT. THIS ISN'T MY PLANET. LET ME GUESS. ANOTHER GALVAN PRACTICAL JOKE? DON'T BE RIDICULOUS. LOOK AT THE ANGLES. THIS IS CLEARLY TETRAMAND WORKMANSHIP. I AM SO NOT LISTENING TO MY HISTORY TEACHER. AGH! ANOTHER ALIEN! SO YOU'RE ALL TRACKING ME NOW! IS THAT IT? DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF. I'M THE SAME ALIEN. ACTUALLY, I CAN TURN INTO ALL KINDS OF ALIENS. DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID? KINDA. I WILL GET THE TRUTH IF I HAVE TO HUNT DOWN EVERY LAST ALIEN ON THIS PLANET! WHY AM I BACK IN THIS WRETCHED PLACE? YOU CANNOT ESCAPE ME, LEPIDOPTERAN! BY THE TIME I GAINED CONTROL OF MY SHIP, THERE WAS NO SIGN OF BEN. I WAS BARELY ABLE TO LAND BACK HERE IN BELLWOOD. SO YOU JUST ABDUCTED HIM? HE VOLUNTEERED. IN FACT, HE SEEMED EAGER TO LEAVE EARTH. HE WAS GROUNDED! AS IN, CONFINED TO QUARTERS? WHY? WHAT DID HE TELL YOU? KNOWING BEN, ANYTHING TO GET OUT OF DOING HOMEWORK. NO, IT'S MORE THAN THAT. HE SAID HE WISHED HE'D NEVER COME BACK FROM OUR SUMMER VACATION. NOW YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE ARE WORRIED SICK. ALSO, I MAY HAVE ALTERED THE OMNITRIX TO PREVENT BEN FROM TURNING HUMAN. AND HE LET YOU DO THAT? IT WAS FOR HIS OWN PROTECTION. SO NOW BEN IS STUCK IN ALIEN FORM AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE HE IS! NO...BUT AZMUTH MIGHT. THE INVENTOR OF THE OMNITRIX? THAT'S HIS SHIP, ISN'T IT? SO AZMUTH DID MAKE IT TO EARTH. THEN WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM? I BET WE'LL FIND ANSWERS INSIDE. [ZAPPING] WOW, THAT'S SOME BUG ZAPPER! TIME TO GROUND THIS INSECT! ALL THINGS CONSIDERED-- OW! I'D RATHER BE GROUNDED BY MY PARENTS! WHOA, CAN'T FLY WITH WATER WINGS! HOT ENOUGH FOR YA? A PYRONITE? HOW MANY ALIENS ARE ON THIS PLANET? ENOUGH TO KICK YOUR BUTT! THEN I'LL JUST HAVE TO FREEZE YOUR BUTT! [SCREAMS] NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION, TELL ME WHERE I CAN FIND YOUR TO'KUSTER BOSS! MY WHAT? THE GIANT ALIEN THAT ATTACKED THIS PLACE YOU CALL BELLWOOD! OH, YOU MEAN THAT EVIL WAY BIG? SO YOU DO KNOW WHERE HE IS! TALK! I DON'T KNOW! I WAS FIGHTING HIM AND HE JUST SORTA-- DISAPPEARED. TO'KUSTARS! DON'T JUST DISAPPEAR! A VANPARTIBLAN SONIC DISRUPTER, WHICH COULD EASILY BLAST A HOLE IN A SPACESHIP IN SUB-ORBIT. - YOUR POINT? - MAYBE YOUR SHIP'S "MALFUNCTION" WAS NO ACCIDENT. WHY WOULD AZMUTH WANT TO SHOOT DOWN MY SHIP? I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER MET THE GUY. I THINK YOU BOTH SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. IT APPEARS AZMUTH WAS TRACKING SOME KIND OF MALFUNCTION WITH THE OMNITRIX. WHAT DID BEN DO TO IT THIS TIME? WAIT. I THINK I FOUND A SHIP'S LOG. TARGET ACQUIRED. TIME TO BLEND WITH THE LOCALS. OH, NO-- YAHHH! [GROWLS] [ROARS] THAT'S THE TO'KUSTAR BEN AND I FOUGHT. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU FOUGHT A TO'KUSTAR! IT DIDN'T SEEM RELEVANT. I'LL DECIDE WHAT'S RELEVANT. WHAT ELSE AREN'T YOU TELLING ME? I WANT ANSWERS NOW! I COULDN'T AGREE MORE! WHO ARE YOU? WHERE'S AZMUTH? AZMUTH IS DEAD. NO... - HOW? - I THINK YOU KNOW HOW. NOW WHERE IS THE ALIEN YOU CALL WAY BIG? BUT THAT'S NOT WAY BIG. I DON'T CARE WHAT HIS NAME IS! I HAVE TRACKED HIM ACROSS THE GALAXY AND AROUND THIS PLANET. HE WILL PAY FOR HIS CRIME! NOW BRING HIM TO ME OR PERISH! [STRAINS] I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE, BUT YOU'RE NOT LEAVING UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHERE MY GRANDSON IS! I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THAT IS. YOU SURE SEEM TO KNOW HIS SYMBOL. TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS SYMBOL. WHAT DOES IT MEAN? SOME KIND OF ALIEN HIT SQUAD? YOU'RE IN NO POSITION TO ASK QUESTIONS. NEITHER ARE YOU. Computer voice: SELF-DESTRUCT ACTIVATED. YOU'RE BLUFFING. I DON'T THINK HE WAS BLUFFING. WE NEED TO FIND BEN BEFORE THAT BLUE UPGRADE DOES. THAT'S ODD. NOW BEN'S CLOSE. VERY CLOSE. Ben/Stinkfly: NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE GLAD TO SEE THIS PLACE AGAIN! GET TO A PHONE. CALL GRANDPA MAX. HE'LL KNOW HOW TO TURN ME HUMAN. [GRUNTS] - OW! - HMM? UH, HI! [SHRIEKS] SANDRA! WHAT'S WRONG? [GASPS] WHOA! GET AWAY! OW! 'SCUSE ME. - GET IT OFF! GET IT OFF! - [YELLS] WHOA! [BOTH GASP] - [SWOONS] - HONEY? HUH? GET AWAY FROM HER, YOU MONSTER! [GROANS] HUH? SORRY ABOUT THAT, BEN. BUT A NEURO-NAP IS EASIER THAN AN EXPLANATION. GRANDPA! OW! WATCH THE SHARDS! WHA? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TURN HUMAN? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH? "GROUNDED IN REALITY." UHHH, HMMM. - BUSTED. - HOW'D YOU LIKE A CRYSTAL NOOGIE? HOW'D YOU LIKE A MAGIC CHARLIE HORSE? - YOU! - NO, YOU! - NO, YOU! - HUH UH. YOU! ENOUGH! THERE. AS SOON AS YOU TIME OUT, YOU'LL BE HUMAN AGAIN. AFTER THAT, YOU AND I ARE GOING TO HAVE A LONG TALK ABOUT HONESTY. I'M INNOCENT. NO ONE IS INNOCENT! BEN! STAY BACK, HUMAN! GRANDPA! YOU'RE HUMAN? DUH! WHAT DO YOU THINK I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU? THEN EXPLAIN YOUR CONNECTION TO THIS ALIEN HIT SQUAD! WHY DON'T YOU EXPLAIN YOUR CONNECTION TO AZMUTH? BEN! WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR WATCH? I DON'T KNOW. I THINK I MIGHT. GWEN! NO! BEN? GRANDPA? I'M NO EARTH EXPERT, BUT SHOULDN'T THERE BE PEOPLE? HELLO? ANYBODY HERE? [ECHOES] Computer voice: ENVIRONMENT: EARTH. PRIMARY INTELLIGENT SPECIES: HUMAN. HMMM. WHY DO I GET THE FEELING WE'RE NOT IN BELLWOOD? Both: WHERE DID YOU TAKE ME? YOU THINK I BROUGHT YOU HERE? DOESN'T MATTER, 'CAUSE I'M GETTING US OUT OF HERE, HERO STYLE. HUH? MY WATCH! WHAT'D YOU DO WITH IT? NOTHING. WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT A WATCH? IT'S CALLED THE OMNITRIX. IT'S THE THING THAT TURNS ME INTO ALL THOSE DIFFERENT ALIENS. WHOA! WOULD ONE OF THOSE ALIENS INCLUDE A TO'KUSTAR? WAIT. YOU THINK I'M THE WAY BIG YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR? VIRTUALLY EVERY ALIEN SPECIES I'VE ENCOUNTERED ON YOUR PLANET HAS BEEN YOU. [SNIFFS] UH, NOT EVERY ALIEN SPECIES. Computer voice: WARNING. DNA PROTOCOL ERROR. LEPIDOPTERANS! WHOA! THAT'S A LOT OF STINKFLIES! WHOA! STOP! YOU'RE ONLY MAKING THEM MAD! [YELLS] DO YOU EVER THINK THINGS THROUGH? UGH, NOW I SOUND JUST LIKE GWEN. YOUR LOCATOR SPELL SAYS WE'RE IN THE OMNITRIX? THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. - ACTUALLY, IT KINDA DOES. - [THUNDER] BUT THUNDER ON A SUNNY DAY. THAT MAKES NO SENSE. THAT'S NOT THUNDER. Computer voice: WARNING. DNA PROTOCOL ERROR. [GRUNTING, GROWLING] - VULPIMANCERS! RUN! - WHOA! WHY DID YOU LEAD US DOWN HERE? GIVE ME A BREAK. I DON'T KNOW MY WAY AROUND THIS PLANET. NEXT TIME LET THE LOCAL GUIDE YOU. IS THIS WHAT YOU'RE LIKE WITH BEN? I CAN SEE WHY HE COMPLAINS ABOUT YOU! UH-OH! PORTALLUS PROJECTUM! ENOUGH GAMES, HUMAN. DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT USE YOUR OMNITRIX TO TRANSFORM INTO THIS TO'KUSTAR? I DID NOT! YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE A HUNDRED FOOT TALL ALIEN WAS RUNNING AROUND BELLWOOD UNNOTICED? I DON'T KNOW. HE JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE! ALIENS DON'T JUST FALL FROM THE SKY! GWEN! TETRAX! WE'RE ON PETROPIA. YOUR HOME PLANET? BUT WASN'T IT DESTROYED? HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE? BECAUSE THIS ISN'T PETROPIA. JUST LIKE THAT WASN'T BELLWOOD BEFORE. THIS IS ALL A COMPUTER SIMULATION. Computer voice: ENVIRONMENT: PETROPIA. PRIMARY INTELLIGENT SPECIES: PETROSAPIEN. A COMPUTER SIMULATION INSIDE THE OMNITRIX. YOU CAST A CRAZY SPELL ON YOURSELF? THAT MAKES NO SENSE. SURE IT DOES. THE OMNITRIX SCANS ALIEN DNA. WHAT IF IT SCANNED US? YOU MEAN LIKE THAT TIME WE ENDED UP IN THAT SUMO SLAMMERS GAME? COOL! EXCEPT WE'RE STUCK HERE, AREN'T WE? YOU WILL NOT ESCAPE ME! PUT DOWN THE DWEEB, YOU UPGRADE WANNABE! YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN HOLD ME, EARTH CHILD? WHY WON'T THIS TELEPORTER WORK? WILL SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? STARTING WITH YOU. WHO ARE YOU AND WHY HAVE YOU BEEN CHASING ME ALL OVER THE WORLD? AND WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH AZMUTH? VERY WELL. AZMUTH IS MY SON. AZMUTH'S DAD IS AN UPGRADE? GUESS HE TAKES AFTER HIS MOM. I HADN'T SEEN HIM IN THOUSANDS OF YOUR EARTH YEARS. HE'D ABANDONED GALVAN PRIME TO FOCUS ON HIS LIFE'S WORK. BUT ONE DAY HE SUDDENLY RETURNED. SAID HE'D MET SOMEONE WHO REMINDED HIM OF THE IMPORTANCE OF HOME AND FAMILY. ME? I SUPPOSE AZMUTH HAD NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT HOW MUCH HE'D HURT THE PEOPLE HE'D LEFT BEHIND. I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE. SO WHEN HE SUDDENLY HAD TO LEAVE ON SOME URGENT MISSION TO EARTH, I COULDN'T BEAR TO LOSE HIM A SECOND TIME. I TRIED TO CONTACT HIM. THIS WAS THE ONLY TRANSMISSION I RECEIVED. - AND THEN, I KNEW I'D LOST HIM FOR GOOD. - NO. IT BECAME MY DUTY TO TRACK DOWN THIS TO'KUSTAR AND MAKE HIM PAY FOR TAKING AZMUTH'S LIFE. I FOLLOWED THE ENERGY SIGNAL AZMUTH HAD BEEN TRACKING TO THE EARTH TOWN KNOWN AS BELLWOOD. I TRIED TO STOP THE CULPRIT FROM ESCAPING IN HIS SHIP. BUT YOU SHOT DOWN MY SHIP BY MISTAKE! IT WAS NO MISTAKE! MY TRACKER LED ME STRAIGHT TO HIM! NO, IT LED YOU TO EVIL WAY BIG. BUT I GOT RID OF HIM FOR YOU. UH, BEN? HOW EXACTLY DID YOU GET RID OF THIS EVIL WAY BIG? OH, YOU KNOW. THE USUAL HEROICS. THE TRUTH? [SIGH] OKAY. THERE WAS A WEIRD NOISE AND A FLASH FROM THE OMNITRIX. AND IT JUST VAPORIZED HIM. YOU'RE WELCOME. WHAT IF YOU DIDN'T VAPORIZE IT? WHAT IF THE OMNITRIX JUST DOWNLOADED EVIL WAY BIG JUST LIKE IT DOWNLOADED US? BEN? WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE, WOULDN'T IT HAVE ALSO DOWNLOADED-- YOUR HOMEWORK AND YOUR LAPTOP? - SO THAT WOULD MEAN EVIL WAY BIG-- - BEN! Computer voice: WARNING. DNA PROTOCOL ERROR. [ROARS] THAT'S THE ALIEN THAT DEVOURED MY SON! SO YOU WERE TELLING THE TRUTH! I'VE BEEN TELLING THE TRUTH THE WHOLE TIME! WELL, EXCEPT TO YOU. BUT I APOLOGIZE. THIS IS FOR AZMUTH! WAIT! YOU DON'T WANNA PICK A FIGHT WITH THIS GUY! OH YES I DO! - Ben: THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT! - Gwen: THIS IS ALL MY FAULT! WHOA. WAIT. THIS REALLY IS YOUR FAULT? I THINK I KNOW WHY THE OMNITRIX KEEPS DOWNLOADING STUFF. REMEMBER THAT DISMANTLING SPELL I DID? I THINK WHEN IT COMBINED WITH YOU AS UPGRADE, IT CAUSED A MALFUNCTION IN THE OMNITRIX. YOU HEARD THOSE ERROR MESSAGES. I MUST HAVE MESSED UP THE ENTIRE OMNITRIX DNA PROTOCOL. NOW WE'RE STUCK INSIDE IT. FOREVER. I DIDN'T SAY THAT. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO. THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN FIX THE OMNITRIX IS AZMUTH. AND RIGHT NOW HE'S BEING DIGESTED BY THAT EVIL WAY BIG! THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY, BEN. [GRUNTS] WHAT'S THE POINT? ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS GET AWAY FROM ALL MY PROBLEMS ON EARTH. IT'S JUST LIKE GRANDPA SAID. I WANTED TO GO OUT AND SAVE THE UNIVERSE, BUT I ENDED UP LOSING MY HOME AND FAMILY INSTEAD. I JUST WISH EVERYONE WOULD LEAVE ME ALONE. THE BEN TENNYSON I KNOW IS ARROGANT, OBNOXIOUS, DWEEBISH, AND DOESN'T SMELL TOO GOOD. GEE, THANKS FOR THE PEP TALK, CUZ. BUT HE'S NOT A QUITTER. SO YOU CAN STAY HERE AND FEEL SORRY FOR YOURSELF. BUT I'M GONNA FIND A WAY OUT OF HERE. [STRAINS] GWEN, WAIT! IF WE MAKE IT OUT ALIVE, WOULD YOU DO MY HISTORY REPORT FOR ME? WHAT? IT WAS WORTH A SHOT. SO HOW DO WE GET OUT OF HERE? IF MAGIC PLUS UPGRADE CAUSED THE PROBLEM, THEN MAYBE THE SAME COMBINATION CAN FIX IT-- BUT WITH A NEGATING SPELL THIS TIME. WELL, HOW'M I SUPPOSED TO GO UPGRADE WITHOUT THE OMNITRIX? YOU DON'T NEED TO GO UPGRADE, DOOFUS. WE ALREADY HAVE ONE. COME ON! FALL ALREADY! HEY! DOWNGRADE! A LITTLE HELP? YOU'RE OUR TICKET OUT OF HERE! NOT TILL I'VE HAD MY REVENGE! DISCOMBOBULUS NEGATUM! WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME? GRAB ON! HUH? WHOA! I HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS. [ROARS] [COUGHING] BEN! GWEN! YOU'RE ALL RIGHT! IS THIS THE REAL BELLWOOD? YES! IT'S ALL REAL! WHAT HAPPENED? [ROARS] VENGEANCE IS MINE! - FORGET VENGEANCE! IT'S HERO TIME! - WAIT, BEN! WHAT'S GOING--? MOM? DAD? I THOUGHT YOU FIXED IT! HEY! THAT'S MY FAVORITE SHIRT! IT'S YOUR ONLY SHIRT! [STARTLED REACTION/ EFFORT MOVING GWEN] WHOA! WANNA BET I GET BLAMED FOR THAT? [GROWLS] [GRUNTS] WHOA! HUH? MOM! DAD! STOP! IT'S ME, BEN! GRANDPA! DO SOMETHING! LIKE WHAT? YOU'RE HIS FATHER. CAN'T YOU GROUND HIM? [GROWLING] YOUR PARENTS MUST BE EXTREMELY DISORIENTED FROM THE DNA TRANSFORMATION. [GROWLING] SO DISORIENTED THAT THEY WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE THEIR OWN FAMILY. SO? DNA PROTOCOL ERROR. THE OMNITRIX ISN'T JUST DOWNLOADING EXTRA THINGS. IT'S UPLOADING THEM AS WELL! THAT'S WHY IT JUST TRANSFORMED YOUR PARENTS. WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I'M SAYING WHAT IF AZMUTH WASN'T KILLED BY THAT EVIL WAY BIG. WHAT IF HE IS THAT EVIL WAY BIG? WE FOUND HIS SHIP NEAR WHERE WE FIRST ENCOUNTERED THE TO'KUSTAR! IT WAS CLOAKED LIKE A TRUCK. TRUCK? MUCH AS I HATE TO SAY IT, GWEN, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. THE OMNITRIX TURNED AZMUTH INTO EVIL WAY BIG. IT EVEN DID THAT WEIRD ENERGY THING JUST LIKE IT DID BEFORE IT TRANSFORMED MOM AND DAD. WHICH MEANS IF WE DON'T FIX THE OMNITRIX SOON, THERE'S GONNA BE A WHOLE TOWN FULL OF CRAZED ALIENS! AND THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN FIX IT IS BEING HUNTED DOWN BY HIS OWN FATHER! [GROWLS, ROARS] All: HUH? WE'LL HANDLE YOUR PARENTS. YOU TWO HAVE TO STOP AZMUTH AND HIS FATHER FROM DESTROYING THE CITY-- AND EACH OTHER! HOW WE GONNA DO THAT? BY GIVING THEM A NEW TARGET. WHOA! WHY DON'T YOU PICK ON SOMEONE YOUR OWN SIZE? NICE GOING, DOOFUS! HOW ABOUT DRAWING HIM AWAY FROM THE CITY? DON'T BE A BACK-SHOULDER DRIVER. IT'S SUMO SLAMMER TIME! WHOA! ANOTHER TO'KUSTAR? I WILL DESTROY ALL ALIENS! STOP! IT'S BEN! WHERE'S THE OTHER ONE? I NEED TO AVENGE AZMUTH. THE OTHER ONE IS AZMUTH. NO! YOU'RE LYING! LET GO! I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE! NO, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO US! YOUR SON WAS TRANSFORMED BY A MALFUNCTION IN BEN'S OMNITRIX. THAT ALIEN IS AZMUTH. YOU DON'T DESERVE TO SAY HIS NAME! IT'S NOT GONNA WORK! THE ONLY WAY TO TAKE DOWN A TO'KUSTAR IS TO AIM FOR THE FRILL! EVERYONE KNOWS THAT. AND NOW HE KNOWS IT TOO, DWEEB! THANKS FOR THE TIP! - WHAT'S WRONG? - I CAN'T MOVE! - THAT'S BAD. - THAT'S WORSE! GWEN! HUH? WE HAVE TO STOP HIM! AND I'M NOT RECHARGED YET! I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT YOU! THEN GIVE HER A CHANCE TO PROVE THAT'S AZMUTH! [GROWLS] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IT'S A MAGIC SPELL. I'M GOING TO TRY TO ACCESS HIS MIND. [ROARS] AZMUTH, PLEASE. YOU NEED TO FOCUS! JUST TELL US HOW TO REPAIR THE MALFUNCTION IN THE OMNITRIX! OMNITRIX... AZMUTH? FATHER. [GROWLS] [SCREAM] NO! AZMUTH, PLEASE! IT'S NOT HIS FAULT! DON'T MAKE ME HURT HIM! HE'S USING YOU AS A WEAPON? NOT AS A WEAPON. AS A TOOL KIT. HE'S TRYING TO FIX THE OMNITRIX. [SCREAMING] WHAT DID YOU DO? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. HE DID! YOU KNOW I'M SERIOUSLY RECONSIDERING THE WHOLE LET-YOU- KEEP-MY-OMNITRIX PLAN. AZMUTH! [HAPPY CHUCKLE] YOU'RE ALIVE! NO THANKS TO YOU! THIS THING WAS SO OVERLOADED WITH MANNA I COULD PICK UP THE READING FROM HALFWAY ACROSS THE GALAXY. OVERLOADED WITH WHAT? THEY HAVEN'T TOLD YOU YET? EH. YOU'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH. SO I SCHLEP MYSELF ALL THE WAY TO EARTH TO DEFRAG THE OMNITRIX AND WHAT THANKS DO I GET? - YOU TURN ME INTO A RAGING TO'KUSTAR! - [GIGGLES] I SHOULD'VE JUST STAYED IN BED. SON, I-- I ALMOST VAPORIZED YOU. HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SO BLINDED BY RAGE? I'M A TERRIBLE FATHER. I HAVEN'T EXACTLY BEEN THE GREATEST SON EITHER, DAD. I ALWAYS LET MY INVENTIONS COME BEFORE FAMILY. SPEAKING OF WHICH, I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE WARNED YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT MECHAMORPH ARMOR. YOU MEAN I WAS HUNTED DOWN ALL OVER THE WORLD BY A GREY MATTER IN AN UPGRADE SUIT? DUH. HE'S AZMUTH'S DAD. WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING? ANOTHER WAY BIG? SO WHY DOES HIS DAD LOOK YOUNGER THAN AZMUTH? KID, YOU GOT A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT GALVANS! CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME, SON? CAN FORGIVE ME FOR SKIPPING OUT ON YOU? OH, SON, I ALREADY HAVE. THEN WHAT SAY WE CALL IT EVEN? LET THAT BE A LESSON-- NEVER MESS WITH MECHAMORPH ARMOR. ALL IT DOES IS PUMP UP THE WEARER'S AGGRESSION. TURNS 'EM INTO A SINGLE-MINDED WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION. TELL ME ABOUT IT. NOW LET'S GO HOME BEFORE ANYONE ELSE BREAKS SOMETHING. ABOUT THAT-- COULD YOU DO ME ONE MORE FAVOR BEFORE YOU GO? I SORTA TURNED MY PARENTS INTO ALIENS. OI. [GROWLS] SON! NO! WHOA! MECHANAE DISCOMBOBULUS! - [MOANS] - BEN! WHERE IN THE WORLD WERE YOU? WE'VE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR YOU. [SIGHS] I-- YOUR GRANDFATHER'S HERE TO TAKE YOU FISHING. YOU MEAN I'M NOT GROUNDED? HMM. I DON'T REMEMBER GROUNDING BEN. DO YOU, CARL? WHEW. - WHERE'S THE RV, DAD? - OOH, UH-- YOU PARK IT AROUND THE CORNER? UH-HUH. I THINK GOING ALIEN MAY HAVE SCRAMBLED THEIR MEMORIES A BIT. AT LEAST IT WAS GOOD FOR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID, BUT THANKS. MAX TENNYSON, I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU. - AZMUTH? - YOU'RE-- ? YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THE KIDS WILL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY. I GOT A HOME AND FAMILY TO GET BACK TO. I'M JUST GLAD TO KNOW YOU'RE ALL SAFE. ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE NOBODY'S GOING FISHING THIS WEEKEND. Both: THIS IS ALL MY FAULT. Both: YOUR FAULT? HOW IS IT YOUR FAULT? MY OMNITRIX TRASHED THE RUSTBUCKET. ONLY BECAUSE OF MY MAGIC SPELL. OH FOR THE LOVE OF-- DO YOU TWO EVER STOP ARGUING? LET'S GO HOME, DAD. HOME. I ALMOST LOST MINE FOR GOOD. NOW THAT YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR WITH YOUR FOLKS, I SUPPOSE THERE'S STILL ROOM IN THE RUSTBUCKET FOR A WEEKEND ROAD TRIP. NO, GRANDPA. I NEVER SHOULD HAVE RUN OUT ON MY PARENTS. NO POINT IN SAVING THE UNIVERSE IF YOU LOSE YOUR FAMILY. I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON. YOU'LL FORGET IT AGAIN. BUT YOU'VE LEARNED IT. Ben: IMAGINE YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL TO STRANGE NEW WORLDS... AND ENCOUNTER ALIEN LIFE FORMS. IMAGINE LEAVING THE WORLD YOU KNOW, EMBARKING ON A DANGEROUS JOURNEY FROM WHICH YOU MAY NEVER RETURN. SOUNDS LIKE SCIENCE FICTION. BUT THAT'S WHAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE TO BE A CREW MEMBER DURING THE AGE OF EXPLORATION. SO ASK YOURSELVES THIS QUESTION: WOULD YOU CHOOSE TO LEAVE HOME, FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE ADVENTURE OF A LIFETIME? I KNOW I WOULD. BUT ONLY DURING SUMMER VACATION. AND I'D STILL WANT SOME FAMILY BY MY SIDE. YOU'RE GOING TO WISH YOU'D STAYED HOME THIS TIME, TENNYSON! [THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
