Dig, man! Come on, Josh. Come on, man. Look, you're just asking for trouble. Chicken? Look, man, I don't play that. Who's ththere? What do you want? We want the doctor. It's an emergency. What's going on out there? Sam, Sam... Who's ringing the bell like that? Sam, please e don't aggravate yourself. It's just some boys. Wait till I get my hands on that punk ringing the bell. Who does he think he is? Be careful Sam, who knows what they'rere up to. Sarah, call for an ambulance. Call a cop. Young punks. A neighborhood full of galoots. No, no, no, no. It's alright, they've gone, they 've gone. You're all rigig, you're all right. What's wrong? What happened? What is this? Ladies night in a Turkish Bath? Go back to bed. Go on home, all of you. She's alright. There's no free show tonight. No blood. Nothing to gossip about. Go on, home. Go on. It's alright. That's Abelman, always got a chip on his shoulder. No wonder he loses patients all the time. Patients like you and your family I don't need. You still owe me for your old man's hernia. Sam. Come up here. Stop fighting the whole world. Okay, break it up, please. Come on. One side, one side. Ah, am I glad to see you. Some galoots dropped her here. We called for an ambulance. They should move her on a stretcher, in case something's fractured. What's your name, Mac? Mac? Who's Mac? You are. If I say you're Mac, that's your name. That's not my name. I'm a doctor. You want to address me, you'll read my name off the sign. Excuse me. Uncle Doc, what's wrong? What happened? Ah, who knows. Hello, Daily Mirror? ThThnight desk, please. Hey, Mr. Bennett? Mr. Bennett, this is Myron Malkin. Listen, I got a great human interest piece. The real heartbreak stuff. You got a second? Myron, don't you copy boys over sleep? Nah, I'm talented. Anyways, the city editor said I ought to try writing some feature stuff, you remember? I do, but does he? Okay, wait a minute. It's a slow night. We may need some filler for the home edition. Let her rip. "Somewhere in this great stone city, a heart beats." "It is faint at times, but it is there, when the city sleepss" "and tragedy stalks the poor." No, I didn't say anything. It's a little e ncy, Myron, but keep it coming. Yes, Alice? Hey, I got a good notice. Uh-huh. Remember that half-hour I did for Johnson? Alright. Yes, I'll tell him. Sure, he'll be there in plenty of time. Thanks for calling. "Excellele TV fare produced with taste by Woodrow Thrasher." Isn't that nice? Woody, that wawathe office. Alice just said that Mr. Loomer hit the panic button. Well, that figures. Hey, how do you like this for an opening? "Somewhere in this great stone city a heart beats." Woody, he's called a meeting in for 10:30 with... Well, whatever his name is, the sponsor. Gattling, dear. Gattling Products. Our source of health and happiness. For free. Woody, don't spill coffee on that suit, please. Alice said that he didn't like your. Well, it was no good in the first place. You knew it? But you were telling me all last weekend how great it was. Honey, I had to sell myself first. That was before I found out what Gattling thought. If the sponsor don't'tike it, I don't like it, get it? Well, does that mean that they may cancel the series or get a new producer? Not necessarily. Old Dad hasn't talked to Gattling yet. Listen, don't get yourself in a lather. I get some of my best ideas driving in. I'll get a gimmick before I hit the Triborough Bridge. Woody, do you have to take that? What, Dexedrine? Listen honey, I'm a slow waker-upper. I've got to get those wheels moving. What's the matter with that? Nothing, I guessss. Except it seems that the wheels just have to move faster. More angles, more gimmicks.. Listen, don't knock 'em. They got us out of that crummy apartment on 63rd Street. You don't have to worry about the kids being mugged on the way to school. What else do you want? If you'd really like to know, I'd like to have a smaller mortgage and a lower stack of these bills. Woody, aren't you even going to look at these? I'll look at 'em tonight. Honey, I'll pay the bills. I'll even reduce the mortgage. All I want to do is sell this series totoattling. All I need is one little gimmick... "One little gimmick,". "One more angle." Well, call it anything you like, just so it sells Gattling Productct. Just so Gattling can see some tie-up between drugs and medical supplies... Hey! Now what? A gimmick! And if it works, the best. Here. What's this? A doctor in Brooklyn? Well, he's a doctor, he's colorful. He must dispense pills of some kind. Here. Call Alice. Tell her I'll be late. Where is this place? Haven Place, Brooklyn. I'll have to ask a cop. Well, what about dinner? I'll call you later. People have been known never to get out of Brooklyn alive. Look out, man! Hey, man, move it out of there! My man, you parked on the wrong side of the street. Now, move the vehicle. Hey, man, I'm talking to you. You'u' too early for office hours. I'm not a patient. You came back at one o'clock I just want to talk to the doctor. You're a drug salesman, huh? What you pushin' today, goof-balls? Here. Come on! Take me to the doctor. Save it, I'm his nephew. This way. Well, where is he? Hey, you're pretty ananous, aren't ya? Look, just introduce me to the doctor. I'll get you a nice new basketball. Funny. Wait here. I'll see if he wants to talk to you. Hey, Uncle Doc! Hey, we made it! Hey, we made The Mirror! We made The Mirror. Right on page five. We made it right here, look! Whatatre you hollering about? What is this? A four-column spread. It's all about you. I wrote it. Congratulations. Call me when you win the Pulitzer Prize. Aw, come on, Uncle Doc. It's about what happened here last night. Listen. "A Good Samaritan of the slum." That's great, huh? And, "A girl, nameless, faceless, alone." "Dumped on a doctor's doorstop by unknown hoododms." "The doctor, Samuel Abelman, M.D. for 45 years, a general practitioner..." You. You wrote that about me? In the paper? That's all I need. Now every nut in the world will start ringing my bell in the middle of the night. What are you kicking about? A little publicity coululhurt ya? It could bring patients. Ah. Next you'll want me to give door prizes, huh? It could help. Your nephew is right, Dr. Abelman. Who are you? Uh, this guy wants to sell you something. No, no, no, no. Oh, what? Storm windows? Insurance? Sorry, buddy, the wrong customer. No, I'm not a salesman. Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Not a salesman, eh? It's a always a personal, friendly call. And before I know it, I've bought twenty volumes on the history of religion. Nice going, Ivy League. Now, listen, this article by your nephew, that's what brought me out here. I was right. It starts already. Every pest with a smart idea is coming out because you, Myron, had to put me in the newspaper. Come on! Look, why don't you go practice some foul shots while I talk to your uncle. Do you have a television set? Don't try to sell me another one. Do you know Channel 3, Federated Broadcasting Company? Well, I'm a producer for them. Here's'sy card. My name's Thrasher. When I saw that article this morning, it occurred to me thth you'd make a good subject for a television program. I don't mind telling you I was quite impressed. What you did for that girl, that was real drama. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What? You going to write a playaybout me? - No, no, no. - Forget it, sonny boy. No, not a play. This is live television from your house. A visit with you. Your family, your patients, your friendly neighbors. Caught you, you galoot! Oh, shut up. Shut up Abelman. You smell up the w wle block with that fertilizer. A little garbage wouldn't hurt. How do you like a galoot like that? Well, why should he throw garbage in your back yard? Why? Because he's one of my "friendly neighbors." What do you think this is, Park Avenue? The Ritz? Fourty years ago, I had a fight with him about the property line. And I proved that he was wrong and he's still angry with me. Doctor, this televisionn progru famous. Everyone in the United States will know Sam Abelman, M.D. Not interested. People wait a lifetime for a chance like this. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm no actor. I don't like television. You want me to sell cough-drops. No. Besides, I've got office houou. Will you listen to this guy? Don't bother me! You know what you're doing? You know what you're throwing away over here? The whole opportunity! Look, I'm sorry I mouthed off at you. If you would have told me what you were here for maybe I could have helped you, you know? Now listen a minute, will you Mr. Thrasher? Don't be sore. I know I can help you.u. No kidding. I can get him to go on your program. Honest. Uncle Doc's a character. He's against everything the first time he hears about it. He's wororing about some guy in Flatbush with a sore throat. Are most of his patients from around here? Yeah, it ain't easy on him, see, because the real poor people have to go to clinics. And the onon with a little dough, they go to specialists. Guten Morgen. Guten Morgen. What'd they say to you? They just wanted to know if the doctor was in. This guy comes once a week for a diathermy treatment. Two bucks. And he brings a buddy from some charity, cause he knows Uncle DoDos a soft touch. Yeah, it's all very interesting. I'm sure he'd be tremendously colorful. But he's already turned me down. Would you wait a minute? He'd be terrific. And maybe I can even help you with the show. Yeah, I suppose so. No, wait already. I got an idea, it may not work. Look, you got five minutes. Please, let me tell you how wewean work it. Why didn't I think about this before? Oh, Mr. Thrasher, here, I'll get these for you. Hot, ain't it? Aunt Sarah keeps the heat going full blast around here. Here, let me take thth for you. That's what I want to talk to you about. The steam heat, you mean? No, Aunt Sarah. Here, sit down. Make yourself at home. See, that's Uncle Doc's wife, Aunt Sarah. Aunt Sarah, you mean? Yeah, that's my idea. See, Uncle Doc beefs with her all the time. But he does everything she says. She likes television. If you pardon the expression, he thinks it stinks. But she says Ed Murrow and them Sunday think programs are real large, see? Myron, I'm not here to conduct a survey. Will you... Will you let me talk, please? Now, this is my idea. If I can get Aunt Sarah on my side, we're swinging, don't you understand? Is it office hours, yet? Yes, he's expecting you, Mrs. Quincy. How do you like that? What's that? Josh Quincy, must have seen him playing football outside. His old lady's been trying to get him in here for a month. Why? He's got fits or something, I don't know. Listen. What I'm trying to tell you about Aunt Sarah. If we can get her on our s se, we got it made. You know what I mean? Listen to me, he's trying to help you! He's a doctor, let him help you. Josh, no. No, no, you can't do this. Let the doctor help you. He's only trying to help you Josh. No, Josh. No, you are sick, you need this doctor. Please. Relax, sonny boy. Free lollypops today. Name and address? Quincy. He's Josh Quincy. 607 Rowan n. What's wrong with him? Well, he's been having fits. Last night he fell down, and he bounced, and he jumped. Fits? You wait inside there and I'll look him over. Take your cap off, you're in somebody's house. You want to give yourself a manicure, you'll be more comfortable sitting. Put the baloney slicer away. I said put it away! Now... We're going to have a nice, comfortable chat. How old are you? Eighteen. Eighteen. You go to school? Do you work? No, man. That's for squares, man. Yeah. You're a smart man. Hot stuff, aren't you? I wonder how touough you are without that cheese dagger. Come on! I want to see how strong a galoot like you is. Sit down. That's a tough kid in there. Uncle Doc will handle him. Last week a punchy fighter took a swing at him. Uncle Doc dropped him right there with one punch. You want to see something? Come here, I'll showow you something. Come on. We'll have a little hand racing. Put t your elbow down ther. Go ahead. Come on, come, come. Now, when I say "Three." Ready? One. Two. Three! How does that arm feel? Tired? Numb? I feel a little tired. Uh-huh. I want you to repeat a sentence after me. "Around the rugged rock," "the ragged rascal ran." Go ahead. What for? I want t to get you a job as President of Columbia University. So I have to see that you talk nice. Go ahead, say it. "Around the ragged rock, the ragged rascal ran." No. You're trying to mix me up. That's... Will you stop being a horse's neck foror ten minutes? Get undressed. Do you really want a job in television? You kidding? You mean like an assistant or something? You get your aunt to tell the old man to do this shohow and I'll get you a vice presidency. See you later. Loomer, I don't think that there's anything left to discuss. I don't like this presentation. Nobody would watch a show I like this. Nobody would buy my drugs if they did. Well, I realize it needs some firming up, Mr. Gattling. A little finalizing here and there. No, no. It's bad. It's dull. I I uldn't possibly put a million and a half dollars into a thing like this. All right, now suppose... I'll tell you something else, Loomer. I don't tolerate rudeness. This man Thrasher of yours, who was supposed to produce this, he doesn't even show up at our meeting. Can't you control your people? A call came in... I think we've been here long enough, let's go. Well a call came in and I can't tell... Well here's your hat, sir. Gentlemen, I'm sorry. My car broke down on the Merritt Parkway. Didn't that towing service call in fofome? Oh, yes. That must have been the call that I lost before the meeting, Mr. Thrasher. Thrasher, Mr. Gattling has just decided to drop "Americans USA." I won't ask him to repeat his objejeions to your work. He just feels that your choice of subjects is dull. He's right. Just a minute, Mr. Gattling. I knew this presentation was stiff. That's why I didn't break my neck getting down here. I wasn't particularly interested in attending a funeral... ThThsher, suppose we talk about this later? This show is your responsibility. Yes. And every word in this brochure was stuffed down my throat by my superiors in this department. Hearts and flowers. Old ladies who work in needlepoint tapestries. Thatatsn't what I had in mind for "Americans USA." Do you remember our original concept, Mr. Gattling? Real people, doing real things. Useful, dramatic lives. People whose every waking minute is drama. I bet I can find a surefire subject for our program in this stack of newspapers. I haven't seen the papers yet, so bear with me for a second. Here. "Global flyers break record." "Living costs hold line." Here's something... "A Good Samaritan of the s sm." Yes, now this is what I was talking about. "Somewhere in this great stone city, a heart beats." "It is faint at times, but it is there." "You can hear the beat in the lonely hours of the morning," "when tragedy stalks the poor." "A girl nameless, faceless, alone," "dumped on a doctor's doorstep by unknown assailants." "The doctor, Samuel Abelman, M.D. for 45 years" "a general practitioner in a Brooklyn slum." Gentleman, there's our man. That's "Americans, USA." Drama, truth, real people. You don't know this man, you've never even seen him. He might be a Red, or a quack. Excuse me. What was that phrase again, Thrasher? Sir? Something about a good samaritan? Oh. "Good Samaritan of the slum." How long will it take you to give me a presentation on this doctor? Six days. You've got three. Lunch withthike McGail at 21. And Charlie has that stock footage for you at two. Cancel. Cancel all of them. Every time I wear this suit. Have I got a clean one? In the closet, as usual. I could have the spot taken out by noon. Not a chance, I have to get over to Brooklyn again. Back? You mean you've been there already? Are you kidding? You think I'll buy a pig in a poke? Now listen, I want to set this thing up fast and I want to set it up with top flight people. There's not too much room at Abelman's, but I'll need at least four cameras. I want Andy Lord for the commentator. I'll need a tape recorder fofotomorrow afternoon. Tell Lord I'll tape as much stuff beforehand as possible. Now tell Loomer, I need Dexter Daw for the director, Charlie Reynolds in charge of production. Oh yeah, and will you call my wife and tell her I can't possibly make it for dinner tonight. Okay, got it? Got it. You're amazing. Two hours ago, I was ready to give up and now you've got everything signed, sealed and delivered. "Signed?" Listen, if I had that old man signed I wouldn't be going back to Brooklyn. That's up to Aunt Sarah. Yes, of course. Aunt who? I must say, I'm a little bit confused. Your nephew led me to believe you'd be on my side. I told her... Myron... Your uncle and I have warned you about being so impulsive. You had no right to drag Mr. Thrasher out here like this. This is a great break for him. That's enough, Myron. If your uncle has said "no" it's going to be no! I wouldn't think about arguing with him. Excuse me, Mr. Thrasher. I'm sorry I couldn't help you. Myron, I'll talk to you later. Now that's fine. You're going to turn out to be a real good con man one of these days. Maybe an account executive. Will you take it easy, Mr. Thrasher? So she'll be mad for a couple of days. I'I' smooth it over. A couple of days? I've got three days... Two-and-a-half days to put this whole thing together. Now I'm going to have to talk to the old man again myself. You can't now, because he went over to Max Vogel's with Josh Quincy, the one with the fits. Who's Max Vogel? He's a doctor. He's Uncnc Doc's best friend. Now there's your idea. Max Vogel. Crazy Max, with the $200 suits. And the crazy jokes. Bet you I'm not gonna use a lot of that. No, but he's good. He really is good. He and Uncle Doc went to Bellevue together. They were classmates. He's the only one Uncle Doc will listen to. Now you're getting it. Where's the phone? Right here. Hey listen, this is terrific. If anybody can get Uncle Doc to go on television, Max can. Schnecken. They're terrific. Aunt Sarah makes 'em. Hello, Miss Banahan? This is Myron. Listen, do you think I could talk to Dr. Vogel without Uncle Doc hearing him? No, I don't. That's very funny. This is personal. Hello, Max, this is Myron. Listen, this is very important. I got such a fella sittin' here, he's a TV producer. Televison, yeah. And he wants to put Uncle Doc on coast-to-coast network hook-up. Myron, what are you promoting this time? Alright, alright. Put him on. He wants to talk to you. Go ahead. Hello, Dr. Vogel? My name is Thrasher. I'm a producer with the Federated Broadcasting Company, and I'm interested in getting Dr. Abelman for a TV program. Sam? M? n television? Why, he's no cowboy. Very amusing, Doctor. I bet. Tell me, what's your angle in this, Mr. Hasher? Thrasher. As I said, I'm the producer of the program. Now I've been talking to Dr. Abelman but he doesn't seem very interested in the idea. Can you blame him? He don't want to be made a jackass, you know. Tell me, what are you going to do, make him queen for a day? No, Doctor. This is a documentary. Real I ople doing what they do everyday. Dr. Abelman will be presented just as he is, self-sacrificing, dignified... Brave, clean, reverent, real high-class. Not even a sponsor, huh? Well, the Gattling Drug CoCoany is sponsoring the program. Well, now you're making some sense. For a minute you sounded like some crazy foundation. The Gattling Drug Companyy. Very important. Thirty million people will be watching Dr. Abelman. This can't help but benefit him. Now if I could just come over and talk to you and Dr. Abelman. Talk to me? Listen mister, this is my afternoon to go fishing. Dr. Abelman hahaalready cut in an hour of my time. Now you want the rest? Listen mister, you want to talk to me? ThThLady Hilda leaves Pier 5 at 2:30. Sheepshead Bay, I told you. Yeah well, if I can get him to come along, okay. If not, you'll just have to talk to me. Yeah. Goodbye. Banahaha ask Dr. Abelman to come back in. And Banahan... If this kid Josh wants to run out on us again, make sure the door I iopen. Well, I've already missedd In a fishing boat by 2:30 I'll freeze to death in these clothes. Well, there's an Army-Navy store two blocks away from here. Army and Navy? How are they on narrow lapels. What? Come on, let's go. I'll take this too, come on. What's wrong with Josh? Well we can't tell yet. I'll have to take some special tests of his head. You trying to scare me? Somemebody should scare yo. Listen. And try to understand. We want to help you. The work I have to do takes a lot of time. He'll have to come back tomorrow. Miss Banahan will give him an appointment. Make an appointment tomorrow for Ms. Quincy and the boy. This is costin' a lot of money and I can see thatat Dr. Vogel is a busy man. I ain't paid you no money yet. It's alright, it's alright. Let me worry about that. It'll be his pleasure. Thank you, Doctor. How would you like to be in her boots? With a galoot like that on your hands? What's that your business? Who appointed you personally responsible? Who's responsible? Can't I make a comment? When are you going to learn not to get involved with your patients? You know, if you hadn't brought him in here, I'd throw him out. Yeah, throw him out. You know, he too has a right to live. Not by suckingng my blood. Better yours. Yeah. What'd she pay you for those x-rays? And the house calls, the office visits. The hours you won't sleep worrying about him. I know you. If I had to depend on your patients, I'd go broke. I don't know how many times I ask you, Max. Don't lecture me. Let me live my own life. Yeah? 68 years old, and you're still trying to make your patients love you. Sam, they don't want love. They want to be impressed. They're suckers, like everyone else. Come here, I want to show you something. I want to show you something new. You see that? Look. See? See that light? You know what that means? Not a damn thing. Window dressing. Ah, but when my patients see it winking and blinking they think I'm the whole Mayo clinic. That's what medicine is, blinking red lights on the diathermy. Keep the customers happy. That's the rule of the house. What's the use of talking to you? No use, so shut up.. I've heard you say this a thousand times before. What's the idea, Max? Another one of your jokes? No, no joke. But I wanted to look up something. What for? So you could eat your heart out when youou find our what he's got? I think I know what he's got. That's what's bothering me. So if you're so smart, you don't have to look up anything. Max. Look! The boy's in trouble. He needs us. A thing like this, if we catch it in time, can make all the difference. Wait, wait. Where are you going? To the medical library. To look up brain pathology. I want to see you later, where will you be? At my office. My Tuesday afternoon office. And you know where that is! Tuesday afternoons I go fishing. You want to talk to me, you know when the boat leaves Sheepshead Bay. Sam. Sam, forget for a minute you gotta cure the whole woworld. Come on, come on, come fishing with me, huh? Miss Bannahan, get my coat and hat please. Alright, alright, we'll talk about it. But on the boat. Come on, we'll take a cab. Alright, we'll take a cab. Good! Now yoyou're showing a little sense. You'll drop me off at the library and then I'll meet you on the boat. Oh, no sir. No, I'll go with you to the library, and then on the boat, you and me... Fishing. Bannahan! Bannahan, close down the store. And don't let anyone in unless they want to pay a bill. We're gogog fishing. Very pleased to meet you. Throw your line over the side and start fishing. I don't want him to see us talking. So, you want to put Sam on some big television show, is that the idea? Yeah. Americans, USA. He'd be the subject of our first program. What's in it for him? Well, recognition. Well, a man who's workrk as hard as he has all of his life deserves some kind of a tribute. Look, you're breaking my heart. You know what I'm talking about. What's in it for Sam? What's he get out of it? Dr. Vogel, this isn't that kind of a program. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get the point. You want him for noththg. I see. You guys. You couldn't get any place with Sam so now you're working on me. You must need him in the worst way to come dragging out here in the middle ofofhe Atlantic Ocean to talk to me about it. Okay I'll get him to go on your show. But, uh, you gotta sweeten the kitty. What did you have in mind? A house. A new house. A big house in a respectable neighborhood with no garbage cans and no noise. The kind of house he'd been dreaming about for thirty years. 1103 Republic Street. Got t? I'll tell you what, mister. You get him the house, s on the television. Well, I can't go around buying houses for people. This program doesn't have that kind of a budget. No house, no Sam. Now, w, 've watched that guy get the wrong end of the stick all his life. I ain't gonna let him get you off the hook just for laughs, and nobody's going to make a sucker out of him while I'm around. Over my dead body. How do you like that? There are no fish around here. What kind of an ocean is this? In Central Park, they got more fish. Hey, I got a fish, I got a fish, got a fish. Hey, look at it him, look at the size of it. Hey, hey! Reel him in, reel him in. Hey, help me with it.t. AB. Hey. Pretty nice. How about that. You get a good size one. Hey. Atta boy! I didn't know they came so big. Yeah. You have to grab them under the gills, and look out for ththspine... Well, well, well. Well look who's here. You live in Brooklyn? You okay? You look a little bit green under the... I'm not a very good sasaor. Yeah, I can see that. Here, come over here. Eat something. That's the only way to beat it. Keep stuffing food down. Here, come on over here. I know what I'm talking about. Take a piece of this. Here. Ooh. I know it burns a little. Here. Chew on salami. That'll take the taste away. That is hot. I feel better. Wait'll tonight. You'll have a hole in your stomach, but don't let it bother you. Mind your business, Max. You came here to see me again, didn't you? I turned you down already. Doctor, you don't know me from Adam. I'm just a guy with an attaché case from a network. But I'm on a spot because of you. Will you let me explain? Oh, I'm listeninin. You know that newspaper article you're nephew Myron wrote for the Mirror? Sure, sure. A fairy tale. Well, I told my boss and on the basis of that article, I'm supposed to deliver you for my TV program. Why me? There are lots of doctors. Why don't you get Max? I'm not deliverable. Watch out for this guy, Sam. He's a con merchant. You won't get a nickel out of i. You do all the work and the guys with the narrow pants get the dough, you know? Butt out, Max. Buttttut. I make up my own mind. No one tells me what to do, including you. Go on. Why me, hmm? Well, I've been watchihi you all morning. I talked to your wife, I talked to Myron and I think k ur appearance before the American public would be a great tribute to the men of your profession who have spent theirir liv. The guy'll have me in tears in a minute. He's talking like you're dead already. There's a dramatic story in your life. What? Climbing stairs for two dollar fees? You'll tell it all wrong. You'll have me standing next to a chart with a pointer and showing how the tablets dissolve inin stomach. Doctor, I wouldn't insult you by asking you to do anything like that. I want to dramatizizyour own views, your own beliefs for thirty million people. My own views? Views on what? The practice of medicine. Malpractcte is what you mean. Put it any way you want. Your pet peeves, your complaints. Not my peeves, young man, not my complaints, but what I perernally have been witness to for 45 years. That's what I want to hear. The opinions you hear expressed on this program are not those of the network, the sponsor, or anybody in their right mind. They are purely the cuckoo prejudices of Sam Abelman, M.D. Quiet, Max, quiet. I also have something to say about certain specialists I know, with their blinking little red lights on the diathermy machine, who think of patients as customers, suckers to be impressed. Is that what you want me to say? Doctor, I'm tryiyi to convince you that anything you say is all right with me. Forget it, sonny boy. I told you, there are lots of doctors. I'm not interested. And more important, Gattling Drug Company, a favor. Well, he's not. We're doing him a favor. Doesn't he understand what it means to be on television under Mr. GaGattling's sponsorship? Well, I got the notion that Dr. Abelman wasn't particularly impressed with Federated Broadcasasting. Or Gattling Drugs, Mr. Thrasher? Well that wasn't mentioned but I'm sure he has a high regard for them. Well everyone has a... Would you stop that thing? Fish scales. We're not interested in this man's opinions. If this old charlatan thinks he can demand a mansion just because he'e's appearing on TV... Oh, Loomer, Abelman didn't demand anything. All I said was if we gave him a house, he might be persuaded. I heard you. Would he like it staffed with servants? Oh, this is a small house in a quiet neighborhood, not the Waldorf. I don't know what this costs, but we could save that much money shooting the show in Abelmanan's actual office. The Gattling show in a Brooklyn slum! I don't know. Using actual patients, Thrasher? Patients, neighbors, the corner druggist. That would be a tie in with the product, of course. But this house, wouldn't it be establishing a dangerous precedent? Don't you think, sir? Possibly, and yet as a token of our esteem, presented byby the Gattling Company, in recognition for his devotion. And as a climax to the program. Fabulous. On camera. For r a lifetime of service to the people, the deed, the title and the keys. Mr. Gattling, I don't understand how you continue to do business with us. I never would have thought of it. Would you, Woody? Never. Well, it seems simple enough. The logical way to... But that's the beauty of it. Just like all greaeat ideas, simple once you know how. Like, Columbus and the egg. Yes? Well? The conference is waiting, Mr. Gattling. You asked me to tell you. Oh yes, of course, thank you, Marie. Quite a day's work, Thrasher. Thank you. You handle the details, Loomer. Don't worry about a thing, sir. Sunday night, we'll make television history. A good show will suffice. Woody, your fabulous, boy. I love ya. I'm sure you do. I could tell t t way you romanced me. But Woody, with the sponsor you got to play it by ear. I had to let him comee up with. You know the routine. Like Columbus and the egg? ByByhe way, what did old Chris do, lay one? Oh no, he just showed Ferdinand and Isabella that... Hey, just a minute there, Thrasher. Oh, I don't think it's anything to worry about, Mrs. T, just an argument. You know how Loomer gets on Mr. T's nerves every now and again. Uh, he's here right now, Mrs. Thrasher. It's your wife. How do you get your news, by carrier pigeon? I don't have to. Jenny said she could hear you two all the way up and down Madison Avenue. Get me Myron Malkin over at Abelman's house on Haven Place. Hello, honey. No, no, no, no. It's just that, uh... Loomer got out of line and I popped off. The show's fin. But I can't come home tonight. No, I got to go over to Brooklyn tomorrow and tape soso background stuff. I'll stay at the Biltmore. Yeah. No, I can't talk to him now, honey. No, I've got somebody else on the phone. Yeah, love to... Yeah, love you too, honey. Bye. Myron? Listen, get me Reynolds in production. Tell himm le closed circuit run-through, Friday. And get Dr. Vogel.l. Dr. Max Ve on Eastern Parkway. Hello Myron. Are you kidding? I won six dollars and forty cents.s.he pool for the first fish. Yeah. Listen, Myron, something I got to clear up before I talk to Vogel. Is this business about your uncle wanting a house on Republic Street on the level? Are you kidding? He's been trying to get out of this crummy neighborhood for twenty years. It got so I couldn't even believe him myself, but I just found out he put a down payment on it. What! Oh no. Well, because... Look, it's too complicated. Myron, I said never mind! Now give me the name of the real estate agent. Yeah. Dannenfelser? Fel... Felser. D-A-N-N-E-N F-E-L-S-E-R. I'm inquiring about a house at, uh, 1103 Republic Street. What do you know about that. Five years I've been trying to unload that old lemon on Republic Street. No sooner do I sell it, somebody else wants to buy it. You sold it? Yesterday. My own famimi doctor. Doc Abelman. Doctor Abelman? Has he already taken title? Huh? No, no he just came with the down payment. We got more papers to draw up here. Mr. Dannenfelser, I want to take you into my confidence. Now, listen and listen carefully. My name is Thrasher. Hiya. How are you boys? Hi. - Alice? - Yeah? Will you have 'em put this tape recorder in the back room. Myron? Yeah? Will you show her where, please? Yeah. And get your uncle out of the backyard. We don't want to waste anymore of his time. Isn't it stretching realism a bit to do a show from this dump? Well, maybe. Hello, Mr. Thrasher. Oh, hello, Mrs. Abelman. This is Dexter Daw, our television director. He'll be in charge of the show when it's on the air. How do you do, young man? How do you do. I'll be in the production office if you want me, okay Woody? Okay. I'm sorry about this household upset but we'll have everything back in first class condition as soon as we're fininied. Don't worry about it, Mr. Thrasher, it's quite all right. Let's go in the back room where the tape recorder is. Sure. And this is the microphone. Well, what do you want me to do with it? Tell a joke or sing a song? I wish this was a musical, you'd be sensational. I noticed that you had several books of American writers and poets in your medical library.y. Is? Well, the doctor and I were brought here froroRussia when we were little children. We grew up on the East Side of New York, and we felt that it was important for us to identify ourselves with what was finest in American life. So we turned to American writers. Thoreau, Emerson, Longfellow, Whittier. These were our heroes, Mr. Thrasher. You know, Thoreau, he had the right idea. Thoreau, he had the right idea. He used to say, "Don't take any nonsense from anybody." "The big shots, the government. NoNody." "Be your own man." Oh, pardon me. Mr. Thrasher, everybody's here now, excece Dr. Vogel. He's in consultation. He'll be here in a moment. Okay, Myron, you've done a good job. Thank you. Myron, he's a regular television producer. I didn't know it could be done so easily in ten easy lessons. What a schnook I was. I had to take medicine. It's all in the lapels, Doctor. Later, later, we'll all applaud later. Hello. Hello, everybody, hello. Hello, everybody. I'm Woodrow Thrasher from the Federated Broadcasting Company. First t all, I want to thank you all for coming. Now, we're going to televise this program right here in Haven Place. And the reason you're all here is because you're old friends of the Abelman's and you'rereoing to be able to help us tell the story of their life. Mr. Thrasher? Yes? Who's going to play Doc on the television? Some famous actor, huh. No. No actor, Mr. Pomerantz. No actors? What happened? You'll all be yourselves. Just as Dr. Abelman will appear as himself, and you, for instance, will be introduced as his friend, the corner d dggist. Now are there any questions before the interview starts? Is the doctor here? Yeah, but he's busy. Come back later, will ya? Look, it's an emergency. I don't care. You're breaking up a whole television... Look, dad, my buddy had a fit! Who had a fit? Josh? Josh! He's twitching, Doc, he's at the chicken n rket! Where is he? I'll follow you. Uncle Doc, in the middle of a meeting you're leaving? Listen, if he's in convulsion, if I Ian see him now maybe I can help him. Uh, thank you very much. Look, take care of the interviews. I'll be back as soon as we can. Okay. What if this happens Sunday between eight and nine? Huh? I don't know. Don't handle the tomatoto. I do the pickin', please. I do the pickin'. Mmm-hmm. Hold your leg up like that. Can you? Hold it up. Fine. Uh-huh. Now how's your right arm feel? Feel any life, any movement? It ain't too bad. All right, now, try your fingers. Up and down. Up and down. Give me a smoke? Is that okay, Doc? Yeah, it's all right, give him a smoke. I want you to get up and walk. Your leg wililstart feeling a little better as you go along. Just for a few seconds. Now don't be scared. I'm okay. All right, now walk to the door, don't be afraid. Fine. Make believe you're chasing some girl. Hey, where you going? Come back here, you galoot. Where'd they go? You'll never find them in this crowd. Mister, did you see two kids running out of there? I've seen a million kids. We better get back, they'll be waiting for us at the house. Will they? The rehearsal. Oh, yeah, the rehearsal. That was a Hughlings Jackson convulsion he had. The brain tumor. It's what I thought all the time. You see how weak he was? Todd's paralysis. It's what I... I knew that the crazy way he was dragging his leg. The whole picture was there. HeHehould be taken to the hospital right away, surgery, maybe so. So the punk has to run out on me, what do you think of that? It's suicide! I'm sorry you're so upset. Look, it's none of my business but here... Why do you break your back for an ingrate like that? Why? Because, he's my patient. Woody, you've get to eat something. And if you're going to Brooklyn tomorrow for rehearsals you'd better get some sleep, too. Yeah. What is it? You told me this morning that Dr. Vogel had arranged for everything and that the show was all set. Sure it's all set. All locked up. But that old buzzard's going to drive me nuts yet. Abelman? Yeah, Abelman. You know, he's got a patientnt a negro boy, has convulsions, brain tumor he thinks. Well, this aftereron, while we were taping, they told him this kid was having a fit in the chicken market. Well, at's where he treated him, right on the floor of that joint. Feathers, sawdust, blood. You went with him? Yeah, I thought it might be something. Well, it was. As soon as that kid got on his feet, he took off, spat in the doctor's eye and ran away. And the old man does it for nothing. I asked him why and d said, "because he's my patient." Just like that. Well, what happened to him? The boy with the convulsions? Josh? Well, Abelman went around to ththtenement where he lives. As soon as he showed up, he had him sent to the hospital. Why? I just thougug maybe that was what was bothering you. Oh, no, no. Of course I'm concerned about the kid, but ititsn't as if it were Johnny or Kathy. No, what I'm worried about is this program. Your patient. Well, put it that way if you like. The whole climax of this programams when we give him the house. And it's beginning to dawn on you that... It's beginning to dawn on me that If he finds out about it, there isn't going to be any program. And if he doesn't find out about it, he's going to spit in our eye, right on camera. In either case, two houses go down the drain, his and ours. This whole, lovely, over mortgaged junior executive type suburban retreat. There's an echo in this room, and it keeps saying mortgage, mortgage, mortgage. Woody, please, can't we sit down and talk about that, 11:20, he out to be at and the bills... the studio right now doing the Jonas program. Woody, I am speaking to you! Two minutes, honey. Woody, is it asking too much to... Hello, Federated. This is Mr. Thrasher, dear. Would you get me Charlie Reynolds in control room four? Yeah. Hi, Charlie. This is Woody Thrasher. Listen, it's about the program Sunday night, the big finish. When we give Abelman the house. Now listen, just for once I'd like to pull a stunt like this off without tipping it beforehand. YeYe, well, what I'd like is a great, big close up of the old man just as we give him the house. Yeah. Well, with all that crew tripping around tomorrow, somebody's liable to tip him off. Yeah, well they won't do it for me, Charlie, but if you asked them... Oh, but Charlie, you're the one they respect, baby. Yeah. Okay, see you tomorrow morning, nine o'clock. Right. Best to the Missus. Thanks. Well, that takes care of tomorrow. Now what about Sunday night? Oh, honey, I'll come up with something. I'll figure a gimmick that... Will you stop looking at me as if I were selling phony oil stock? That run-through was much better. Dexter, you got to move your cameras faster. Myron! Myron! Yeah? Keep the gang from stepping on each other's toes. Check. Now I want to take it again from the top, this time with the cast. Let's do it. Okay, stand by here we go. Open on Lord coming out of the front doooor. Tonight the Gattling Drug Company presents a new series of programs called Americans, USA. We are going to present to you the unsung heroes of your community. Men and women who get no medals for their work, no special recognition for their labors, and little financial reward. First in our series, we present Dr. Samuel Abelman, M.D., who lives and practices here, in this house, in the Browns Ville section of Brooklylyn. Since 1912, this sign has meant compassion, help, sympathy, Ready, camera one. To many in this poor community, Go one. Settled years ago, mostly by immigrant minority groroups. Come in with us to the waiting room of Dr. Abelman's office. And here you will see some of the Doctor's neighbors and friends. All right, ready on two. Let us go in and visit with Dr. Abelman. Hello. Hello. Go two. Good evening, Doctor. Oh, hello, o, hello, Mr. Lord. How are you? Very nice to see you. Sit down, will you? Thank you. Whatat are you reading? A medical book? No, no, this is... The name of this book is Walden, by one of our great American writers, Thoreau. One of my favorites. I read a little of this every night. It relaxes me. Just listen to this. "Let us spend one day as d deliberately as nature" "and not be thrown off the track by every nututhell and mosquito's wing" "that falls on the rails." Those are valuable ideals and beautifully stated. Doctor, it is the purpose of Gattling Drug Company Incorporated to bring to your fellow Americans the inspiration and dedication you have given to your p pfession. The unselfish contributions that you have made to humanity over the years. Don't pin any medals on me. I'm just a midget compared to this man right here. You mean Harlow Brooks, your professss at Bellevue during your student days? YeYe. That was a giant. There was a dedicated man. A healer. You know, he used to say to us, "To be a good doctor, you have to know the whole man." "His problems, his anxieties." He used to pound into our thick skulls all the time. He'd say "Not pills or medicines are important, but people." Wait a minute, e, wait a min... People are important. Yes, and to know the whole man he said you have to be a general practitioner. He predicted, that there'll come a time when there'll be a specialist for one toe and a specialist for another toe. Is that the rereon you're so annoyed with specialists? Ah, no. I've get nothing against the specialist. It's the phonies, the galoots that give me a pain in the neck. You use this word "galoot" quite frequently. What exactly is a galoot? Well, the only way I can explain it, a galoot is a guy that takes, but gives nothing in return. Would you say that there are galoots in the medical profession? Ooh, are there. There's more quackery in the medical profession than one cares to admit to. I'm sure you wouldn't say that about all doctors, or all hospitals. I'm not talking about all of anything. There's the good and there's the bad. But, but even one in ten is one too many. Take for instance these phony commercials with the endorsements. Quote "Popsidoodle melodious" "will keep yououchildren from getting decayed teeth..." Mr. Gattling, I think anything as controversial as that will have to be edited. Would you be quiet for a minute. I want to see how far he goes. Well, for instance, you knkn that they're now making drugs for which there's no disease yet? They're waiting for the disease to come along to fit the drugs. Now, you take your high pressure commercials and you frighten the poor suckers, they run out and they buy the stuff. Look, Doctor, this is on closed ciciuit. We are being seen at the agency and by the Gattling Pharmaceutical Company. Oh, I see. Well, in that case, just sit there and relax, I'll give you a magazine and some cigarettes and I'll talk to them personal. I mean, face to face. Here. Mr. Gattling, I... Shh. Listen, folks, how many of you know, for instance, about the kickback rackets? Hmmm? Doctor... Don't boboer me. Sit down. You're not well. Sit down. Or for instance, have you ever been inside of one of those mental institutions? Where they have goons instead of guards and they treat the inmates worse than they, would criminals, huh? Did you over see one of these mental institutions? I'd like you to. That's the Travicanti baby. The poor little stinker's got a bronchial condition. I have to take care of him. I'll be right back. Just, just wait. I'm coming back. You, you can talk to them now. Well, that'll take some time, fellas. We'd better knock off for today. Thanks. Oh. Great Dex, great. Yeah. No, no I don't want the Abelman house, I want the special line to the mobile truck and I want it fast. Alice, put Mr. Thrasher on, immediately please. WeWe, he's with the engineers right now, sir. The police said we couldn't have hot cables on the street. If he's not on the line in ten seconds he's out of a job! And that goes for you too. Oh, hurry up. He's red hot really! Otherwise I would never... Okay. Go stall t t cops until I get back. Go ahead, will ya, Loomer. I've only got a second. Now you listen to me, Thrasher I've had a a the damned nonsense I can take from you and that imbecile doctor. We're running a business not a country store and I'm not going to have an old creep come in here and alienate a half a million dollars' worth of prime time. What difference does it make what he said? I'll tell you what the difference is. Exploitation came up with an idea that could sell a million dollars worth of product. If he keeps his mouth shut about commercial drugs. Uh-huh, uh-huh, what's the brainwave? Just this, Mr. and Mrs. America are going to furnish Dr. Abelman's house for him. What? Well, I thought that would get you. What we're going to do is put a slip in each and every package of the Gattling line. And anybody who wants to c ctribute to the furniture fund has to... Oh, no, no. The legal departmentnt looking into the tax angles now. And transportation is going to send sightseeing buses out there twice a week. That'll be enough of your attempmpd humor. And let's get over the idea that you're dealing with Dr. Schweitzer! Now yoyojust march yourself in there and acquaint that old humbug with the facts of life. Loomer, I can't do that. I don't want to hear any more talk about it, Thrasher! Do it! Now! And I want you to meet me in 45 minutes at Gattling's office. This thing has gone too far for any more slip ups. I'll say it has. What? Nothing, nothing. All right, I'll be there. Dr. Abelman... Yah, I'll see you in a minute, Woody. Dr. Abelman, there's something about this program I I ven't told you that I think you ought to know. Yeah? What? The Gattling Company is buying you that house on Republic Street. They're doing what? They want to present you with the deed to that house. Sunday night while the program is on the air. It's to be a surprise. I wasn't supposed to tell you. The joke's on them. They can't give me something I already own. I'm signing papers tomorrow. We've arranged with Dannenfelser, your real estate agent to return your down payment. That was it all along, huh? Sonny boy, who do you think I am, one of your old ladies in the wheel chair they have in the morning there, and they give her 500 dollars when she answers "George Washington crossed the Delaware?" Sorry, buddy. Not me. Sarah. Sarah! Did you hear that, Sarah? Did you hear what finaglingg w? Sam, please, what are you shouting about? Oh, a fine friend you turned out to be, Thrasher. I can see it now. What you were going to do to me. Hello, everybody. Hello, the whole United States. Cry a little for this gray-haired old dope. 45 years practicing medicine and he can't afford his own house. So, we'll give him one. Here, take it. With the compliments of the benevolent and public spirited Gattling Drug Company Inc. No, Mr. Thrasher. I stand on my own feet. And I stick to my word and I expect others to do the same. That was not our arrangement. No bribes. No charity. No show. Doctor, there's no disagreement between us, I assure you. What's the matter with you, what are you sore about? You to, Joseph Pulitzer, you got me into this mess. With your newspaper stories. What is he talking about? Your uncle has refused to do the show. What? You're joking. Will you tell Mr. Thrasher you're joking? Will you tell him that he's a bull thrower? Like all the rest of them, that's what he is. Telling me these fancy stories, how dramatic my work is. And all the time it'a a scheme to show me up in front of the world as a failure. Buy me a house. Well, I fooled them. I'm no failure. I live my life as I choose. I bought that house myself. On my own, like everything else I've done in my life, on my own! You bought that old house? That old wreck? Sarah, darling, please, I'll discuss that with you later. They wanted to buy you a house, that's why you're quitting the show? 'Cause they wanted to buy y u a house? Dr. Abelman, do you realize that... Playing me for a chump I don't take handouts. It was my y idea to give you that house, but not publicly, not like this. Publicly or privately, I want nothing for nothing. All right, Doctor. You go right on hating the galoots and the bubull-throwers. Somebody's got to. Mr. Thrasher. Why? Why did you have to tell him? You could have got away with it until after the show. Now there isn't going to be a show. Why? I don't know, Myron. I don't know. Maybe it's because I'm an idiot. In my whole entire life, I never heard of such a thing. A man tuturns down a house, something he's wanted all his life. All these years you've wanted out, right? Dreaming and planning, so what do you say? No. What are you ashamed of? Everybody tatakes money on television. College professors, generals. Only you got to be different! I'm no professor. I'm not one of your high class people. I'm not a general who gives or takes orders. I'm a general practicioner. And I take orders from nobody. If you feel so strongly about it, Sam, I'm sure you did right. And I don't want to hear anything from you. Sure, go ahead, encourage him. Go ahead, encourage him. It's your fault too, you know. A doctor's wife is supposed to push him, to give him ambition. To holler for a big house and furs and jewels so he'll make more dough. But you, no, you let him do anything he wanted to do. That will be enough, Myron. And what about me, huh? This was my big opportunity. This was my big chance. I had it made in television. You had whatat made in television? Myron, Myron, you're such a little boy. Just because some man came in here and offered you a job. Myron, that's just the beginning. I don't know. 24 years old and you haven't matured much. You haven't grown up. You just foforget about It. Forget about the whole thing. Everything I said before, forget about it. Myron... I just wanted to help Uncle Doc, that's all. Myron, you don't really know your uncle. Do you think he'd be any different on Republic Street? On Eastern Parkway? On Park Avenenue? Or if he wore a white coat? No. He'd still get angry with his patients, and drug companies and dishonest doctors. Moving away won't change all the poverty and hypocrisy and cruelty in the world. That's what he's really mad at, not the boys in the street. Sarah, Sarah, Sarah. It's wasted breath. Wasted, wasted, wasted, Sarah. He'll never understand. The age of the galoots, the fast buck... The "something for nothing" crowd. Hmmm. That fellow, Thrasher, I was beginning to like him. He should be here any moment now, Mr. Gattling. 45 minutes he said. Actually, a run-through like this is just to give us an idea of what to look out for. You understand that? Thrasher assured me that Abelman's, uh, views will be conciderably pruned before the actual show. Hmmm. I thought it best that you got a first-hand report from the producer, hmmm? And... Ah, there you are, Woody. Right on time. I've been explaining to Mr. Gattling that what he saw this afternoon bears veve little relation to what will be on the air Sunday night. Well, you haven't told any lies yet. It bears no relationship to anything. There isn't going to be any program Sunday night. Not with Abelman anyway. What are you talking... Have you been drinking, Thrasher? Nope. I told him about the house and he called the whole deal off. What, you mean he refuses to accept it from us? Flatly. What in the name of all that's h hy possessed you to tell him? I don't know. I can't flgure it out myself. I can. You had the wrong attitude about this show all along and now you've finally succccded in sabotaging it. Wellllyou're finished, Thrasher. Fired from the program, from Federated Broadcasting, and, If I've got anything to say about it, from the entire industry. That figures. Get out! I assume full responsibility for this, Mr. Gattling. Federated Broadcasting will make complete restitution for... I'm not interested in that. Just a minute, Thrasher. Are you posltive Dr. Abelman won't appear on the show under any conditions? You mean, if he could be toned down, sir? With another producer, perhaps. I don't mean anything, except that I want him. He's the first fresh thing that I've seen in two years. He's honest, he has character, and he speaks his mind. Well, there's no question about that, no question at all. If he just didn't speak it about the product, he'd be... Loomer, you seem to be under the impression that I'm selling snake oil. I'm nono I manufacture a reputable product. And I'm interested in the opinions of any professional man about them. I happen to have a responsibility to the public too, as the doctor reminded me not over an hour ago. Maybe there are too many galoots around. Do you think you could persuade him to go on with the show if we prprised him no compensation at all? That seems to bo his customary way of doing business. Now, if I could tell him what you s sd, I'm sure of it. That's up to Mr. Loomer. Well, there'll be no trouble on that score. Will there, Loomer? Trouble? Oh no, sir, no trouble at all. Well, get going, Woody. Get on it. You've got a show to get out. Listen, I think I better come along with you. I'd rather you s syed for a few minutes, Loomer. Yes, sir. And Myron? Yes, sir? Have these phones killed 15 minutes before air time. Check. Hello? Police? Yeah, just a minute. Dr. Abelman. Excuse me, please. For me? Hello? Yeah. Yes. That's the kid... When? What did he do? An hour ago? That little rat. Well, we have to get him back to the hospital. I'll be right over. Sure, right now. What's up? It's that Quincy kid, Josh. He sneaks out of the hospital, his head in bandages, and he and his lousy gang steal a car, they wreck it, the galoots! It's terrible I suppose you couldn't get Dr. Vogel to go? No, I suppose not. They're in a local police station. That imbecilic little punk. Oh, Doc, where're you going? The show's going on in about an hour you know. Listen, I'm going with you. That's okay, sonny boy. Myron, get everything ready, we'll be right back. My dear lousy patients. They won't let ya live. I'm Dr. Abelman. Oh, he's upstairs, Doctor. Come on, Woody. Hey, you! Only the doctor can go up there. You'll have to stay down here. I'll wait down here, Doctor. Don't be too long. All right. I'll go up to the kid and I'll see you in a few minutes. Oh, this way, Doc. What do you want from me? Why don't you get off my back? Still a horse's neck, eh, Josh? A simple fracture. He has to go to the hospital anyway. Well, they can set it there. Well, it'd mean the prison ward, Doc. Well, prison ward, it'll be the prison ward, but it has to be done immediately. Yes, sir. Ever since I seen you I've been in trouble. Yeah, sure, sureresure. Yes, I've been awful mean to you, Josh. Josh, what's the matter with you, eh? Why can't you be human? Ain't gonna listen to you. No, of course not. Don't listen to me. Don't listen to anybody. Like the rest of you punks. Know it all. Blame all your troubles on everybody else, except yourself. Just get out of here. Look, why don't you just split, huh? Huh? Split. Split. I used to feel sorry for you, Josh. I wonder why. Josh, now do me a favor, will you? Try to be a man, huh? Dr. Abel... Dr. Abelman... We'd better get back to the house, it's close to airtime. Wait a minute, Dr. Abelman, please. I I t something to tell you. Hey. Hey, c'mon. C'mon get back in there. Hey, where do you think you're going? I want to talk to the doctor, please. Dr. Abelman! Dr. Abelman! What's going on up there? I want to talk to the doctor, please. I want to apologize. I want to o e him. Well, what do you know? The e ttle galoot is human after all. I wish you wouldn't go back up, we haven't got much time. We haven't got much time? What about him? We owe him something, Woody. As rototn as he is. I'll be right down. What's wrong? Wait. Let me... Let me rest... On you a minute. Sit down. Can I get you anything? Like a vice closing in. Not a word to Sarah, or anyone. I'm going... I'm going home... Help me up. What... What happened? What happened out there? No lousy heart a aack is gonna get the best of me. What happened down there? Is the doctor there? I want to see him again, is he there? I ain't mad at you! Do you hear that, Woody? Do y y hear that? I'm sorry! He does have feelings, like you and me. He just didn't have a chance. The world... The world didn't give him a chance. Sam. Sam, what's wrong? What happened? I'm... I'm fine. I'm fine, Sarah. Just too much white fish for lunch. Would you like a cold drink maybe? Can I get you something? Okay, all right, Sarah. I'll take care of Sam. Where's Myron? Uncle Doc, what's wrong? What happened? Myron, my bag's in my car, go get it. Quick, quick! Go in the living room, go in the living room. A little bicarbonate and he'll be fine. It's all right. It hit him right after he climbed a flight of stairs. I heard him say it was a heart attack. Wise guy, huh? Still climbing stairs at your age. You... You ain't kidding me, Max. Muscular spasm... Gastritis. I got a coronary. Oh sure, sure, you know all about it. Do I teach you to spread manure on your dahlias? I'll tell you what you've got. All right, go out. I could use half a grain of morphine while you're talking. Just a minute, Sam. How does it feel, Sam? No... It's no picnic. Just... Just like it says in the books. The chest first, then the arms, and the wrists. You lie quiet for a moment, and don't talk. You'll be all right, Sam. I'll be back in a minute. He's okay. A littttle spasm in the chest. You don't have to hide anything from us, Max. Sam had a coronary. I don't know how bad it is, but at his age, it's bad enough. All right. Please. Heparin. Anticoagulants? Max! Pomerantz, please. If I need a consultant, I'll send for you. In the meantime, go open your store, and fill the p prescription. Myron, call my office, and have Miss Bannahan bring over my portable EKG. Wait, wait. And, tell her to call surgical supplies for an oxygen tank. Max. That bad? No, no. It's a precaution. He's a long way from needing it. Go on in, and get him into his pajamas, Sarah. He looksks like he's ready for an argument. Anything I can do to help? Yeah. Clear your bunch out. No show tonight, pal. Tell them no noise. Is he going to pull through? I'll know better w when I take an electro-cardiograph. May I have your attention please? Dr. Abelelman is sick. What happened? Well, right now, we don't know how sick. Dr. Vogel's with him. Naturally, the program's been canceled. Now, if you'll all go home as quietly as possible, it would help. Thank you for your cooporaration. We'll stay, we'll help. No, I think it would be better if you went home, Mr. Travicanti. Dexter, break down the unit. Tell the fellas s be quiet. I'll call Loomer. They'll have to run an old movie to fill out the hour. Where are you going? Lay down. What... What does it say, MaMa. Oh, you want to be your own doctor now. I see. Go ahead. Come on, come on. You can't fool an old general practitioner like me. Max, what do you see? How much damage? Now look, Sam, if you're going to be impossible... You must stop exerting yourself, Doctor. Fat chance he'll listen to you. Dr. Abelman, you shouldn't. Very smart, brilliant. How about running around the block a few times? Or playing a couple of games of handball? What do you mean by sitting up like this? Take it easy, Max. Can't I... Can't I look at my trees? So you looked at them, all right? Now laladown. Bannahan, if he pulls anymore stuff like this and I'm not around, you have my personal permission to hit him with a bed pan. Sammy, I swear, I'll fill you so full of morphine, you won't bebeble to move. I want you to lay still. Max, Max. Eh, coco here. Come here. I want to shake your hand. Why? To show... To show you my appreciation for what you've done. Let go. Let go, you nudnik. What's the matter? Are you crazy or something? You never did have a grip, did you, Max? Max. Now... Now, tell me how sick I am. Me, tell you? Who could ever tell you anything? Max said so. Didn't you say so, Max? Didn't you say he'd make it? Ah come on, you know what? I bet he's laughing at us in there. He'll be up totomorrow. He'll be out in the garden, I bet you. Dr. Vogel, could I speak to you? Would it be all right if I w went into see hi? What for? It would mean a lot to me. Okay, but don't make it too long. Yes? Dr. Vogel said it would be all right. Hello, Woody. How are you feeling? Fine. Max knows his stuff. I kid him a lot, but he's a good doctor. He says you'll be fine in a few days. Sure. I'm sorry about your program. You went to so much trouble. Don't worry about that. The only thing that matters is that you get well. I've been watching you run your program today. You dodo your work well. It's a lot easier than your job. Don't knock it. I've been needling you fellas about the tricks with words. There's nothing wrong with gooood words. Shakespeare, Emerson, The Bible, Thoreau. You remember this, Woody? "Why should we be in such haste to succeed" "in such desperate enterprises," "if a man does not keep pace with his companion?" "Perhaps it is becauause he hears a different drummer." "Let him step to the music which he hears," "however measured or far off." Oh. You read Thoreau beautifully. Hey DoDoc, have you ever been to Walden Pond where Thoreau built his cabin? No. For 40 years, I've been planning to go. Something always came up. I'll tell you what. As soon as you get well, we'll take a trip to Walden. It's beautiful in the summer. We'll take Sarah and Annnn. How about it? Great. I think you'd better go now. Why? Why are you chasing him away? He's... He's cheering me up. He just made me the best offer I've ever had. Don't you forget. We've got a date. I'll hold you to it. I won't. We'll go. It'll do me good to get out of t ts place. So long, Doc. Goodbye, Woody. That's the works, Woody. You staying? Yeah. Thanks Dexter. The crew didid great job. I hope the old guy makes it. Yeah. Woody. Annie, what are you doing here? They put on an old film, and I knew something had happened. The old man's in tough shape. Yes, I know. I phoned the office before I caught the train. Woody, it's a shame. He wouldn't quit. What'd they say at the office? Well, it wasn't good. Alice said that Loomer holds you responsible. It's not your fault, is it, Woody? I'm the producer, I should've kept him here. That poor kid needed him too. Loomer's sore, huh? Well, he has reason to be. I gave it to him real good. There goes the job, Annie. There goes the house, the works, we'll have to move back into town. We made it all right before. Does that bother you, Woody? It shohod, but it doesn't. You know, he said something to me just now. He said he'd watched me and I do my job well. I do too. Not as well as he thinks I do, but, I'm okay. It's just that I stepped out of my class. The angles, the e mmicks, that's for Loomer and the galoots. They can't run me out of this business. They need me too. I'm just sorry about the kids moving into town. Kids are strong. They'll grow anyplace, just like weeds. And they turn out good or bad, regardless. Just don't try living their lives for them. I hope he pulls through. He'd be nuts about you. Dr. Vogel! Dr. Vogel! Come on, come on, come on. Come on. Come on, breathe. Breathe, Sam. Come on, breathe, Sammy, for me. For Maxy. Breathe for Maxy, Sammy. Breathe. Come on, Sammy. Comemen, Sammy. Come on, breathe, Sammy. Breathe. That's my Sammy, that's my Sammy boy! Come on. I've got the fishing boats reserved for tomorrow, Sammy. Come on. Max, help him. Sammy, don't go. Don't go, Sammy. Who's going to give me anatomy notes? You want me to flunk out of Bellevue? Don't go, Sammy. Breathe! Breathe, you idiot. Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Stop! Stop! Make him Stop! Stop it! Stop it! You can't help him. You can't help him. Please stop. All right, Sammy. Nothing to get mad about anymore. I'm all right, Myron. Max, please. I'd like a minute by myself with him, please. Cause of death... Coronary occlusion. Cause of death... Fighting other people's battles. Bye, Myron.
