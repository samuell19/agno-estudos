Damn! Where have they crawled from? Look there are two or three thousands... Perhaps even more. I call the First one! An enemy platoon is approaching you. Get ready for the battle. First one! First one! Get down to work guys! Fire! Come one! There are few of them!... Allah akbar! Allah akbar! Go around them on the right! Allah... You'll get nothing here! Shakhid! Shakhid! What's going on? Who's shooting? We've bumped into russians! Don't get into the battle! Don't get involved! Bypass them. We've got another mission. I copy you! Zero one! Zero one! This is Ten! A big platoon of enemies is moving north east. From ten to Zero One!.... A film studio «TONAP» represents a film by Vyacheslav Davydov «THE BREAKTHROUGH» Company! Get to the car! Come one faster! Fill in! Company equal! Dress! Marching column. Left shoulder forward. March! To field Twenty from Five One, do you copy me? Over. I'm field Twenty to Five One! I copy you! I'm going home! Seven wounded on board. Arrange a meeting with a Scalpel. Do you hear me? Over. I want to go home. Are you all right? Are you ok? All's fine. Ali, don't shoot! Don't shoot, Ali! Fuck you! From 303 to 51. We've got out of risk area. All is quiet below. Maximum visibilty. Copy you 303. Setting main course. Copy. We follow! We follow! Get up, you, jackal! I can't... Pah, you jackass. Valerka! Ruslan, if you kill them all, who's gonna carry the goods? None of your business! Move it, move it, go, go, go! Hey, Private, where's the Captain? He remainded in the copter. Come on, honey, everything's gonna be okay. We'll cure you, you'll be fresh and healthy, come on. Fyodor! Brother! How are you, bro? OK? I'm fine. I wish I had a good sleep. Pah, it's hot! Conditioner's off in Semyon's copter. Anyuta, I'm here. Isn't it's time to change bandages? Let's have a look at it, Major. As many girls so smart and pretty, as many fine and tender names… Hands off, fiance! Semyon! I said let go! Don't let this get you, it's nothing. What makes you think it's bothering me? Well-well… What do you think you doing? Cool, Anyuta, why are you so harsh? Are you hiding anything there I haven't seen already? Don't you stare at me! Are you out of your mind? Nah, guys, look at her! Have you seen that bitch? She goes to sleep in one tent at night, and wakes up in another in the morning. And still putting showing off. - Bueno tu! - Hey, hey! Hey, what's up, Junior? Hey, hey, I'll kill you for my brother, understand? Why is he rushing on me in the first place ? I'll kill him myself! Okay, get off! Are you out of your mind, mate? Now, calm down, Semyon, eh? Don't eh me, eh? Eh shmeh? - He is… you know… - What? He has a crush on her. - On who? On Anyuta? - Yeah. Screw him! How should I know? Well, let it go. Yeah, let it go! She was bandaging my finger all right. She gave you a nice slap, didn't she? Yeah, she did. Oh that girl... Your brother was no better… well, let's go. Yeah, let's go. That's interesting. Come to my place tonight. Now go. Ooo…hot. How does it taste? Delicious? Don't talk about it... Delicious.¨ So we have an order to move to Dagestan. Again to Dagestan! Why? Haven't we had enough of it, Mr. Kirpatrick? The more hostages we get there, the sooner Russia accepts all our conditions. We've already got them. We should make another critical step. Trust me, Murad, the situation is going to change radically. Go unsaddle him. Go, go. Well done, Firuz. Now go check up on horses. Right, Tabosh, sure. So, why did we take this way? This route is better than the other one. It's more convenient. Is it closer? Yes, sure. Well, you be careful, old man, or…. Are you going us to pay? Of course. Money have already been transferred to your accounts. No cheat? Eh, as agreed. We are going to work off our contracts in the most honest… Everything's right, Glover. We've got to hurry. Thank you, father. Well, speak up… You've changed lately, Murad. Alikhanov is not pleased either. If I were you… You'll never be me! Don't get away to your emotions, Murad. It can ends not very well. For who? For all of us. You are free. I don't need you now. Let's trust Allah's will. Good morning, Colonel-General, Sir. Hello, Sasha. A huge enemy regiment of no less than a two thousand people people is moving to our destination. I believe, they are trying to retire to foothills. In order to block their way, we should take position in a heigh 785, dominating the exit of the canyon. Unfortunately, our presence in this area is weak. The Army is still moving up. We've got only one landing battalion here, and that one is scattered around the garrisons. Have you calculated enemy's routes and destinations? There is only one way from the canyon, they won't be able to pass this height. How much will it take to throw back-up out there? We can't run in these rocks. So, it will take no less than two days. Shevkunov, you are going to block the path. I'm out of people. I have just one company in reserve. I just haven't got anymore… Well, a paratrooper company is worth a battalion! It's all about the element of surprise. So, get the company on board, saddle the height and hold it until the main forces arrive. Two battalions of the Eighty forth regiment are already on the march. It's all too smooth. I'm sorry? The back-up may not arrive on time. Colonel! It's not our first day on the war. Everybody understands everything. The allow me to take command of the company! Personally! No, I won't. - Who's the commander of the company? - Kartsev. The capitain of the Guard. Who is it? Combating officer. Sit down. Our task is to prevent an enemy's breakthrough. Any questions? All right. You are free, officers! Officers. A hundred versus two thousands… Alexey, your son, Vanya, is in this company… I know. I was thinking… Maybe I'll need young smart officers at the headquaters. No, thank you. It's a challenge to our country. To all our citizens. Oh, hi, my sweetie. Hello. - How are you, honey? - Thank you. I brought this for you. Bananas...juice... Have you heard what Mr. President said? So what will be now? Oh my dear... There have already been so much in my life! Afghanistan, Angola, Karabakh, now Caucasus. Now it's Ivan… But I hope and believe. I hope and believe... Because everything will be alright. Yes Yes of course I'm sure too. Ivan Kazakov needs an officer in the headquarters. I was thinking… Maybe you… Father, are you telling this to your son or to the Lieutenant? You know, I'm not going to hide behind your big back. You know! I'm a son of a General, not a daddy's little boy. Don't worry, everything will be alright. Okay, done with it. Here, call your mother. You've called to the Selivanov's residence. We are out now. Please leave your message or call back later. Mom is not home... what a pity... Hi, mum. I'm ok. Mum, dad is here nearby… i miss you… How is Ksyusha? Is she in the hospital already? Mum, stay with her while she gives birth, okay? Don't worry about us. Dad is fine. Ksyusha and me decided to name our son Alexey. Bye, mum. See you in three months. Many kisses. Love you. Hello, hello... You said Alexey? Well, Alexey Ivanovich will be, heh? Didn't expect that. Thank you. Is it far yet, father? If we hurry up we'll be there at morning. We need to be earlier. Is there another more shorter road? It is. To the other world. Showing off, huh? Shut your mouth, old man, otherwise… Don't try to scare me. I'm not afraid of anything. Have you seen what I do with prisoners? Yes, your father would't have done it. Leave my father alone. The Koran doesn't say that if you kill an infidel, you get a place in Heaven. And your arms are all in blood. Shut your mouth, I said, old man. And remember, who is not with us is our enemy. Allah is merciful. He is about peace and consent. When everybody is dead, who will remain the earth? And all because of them. Yesterday he was laying under the palms and now he's teaching me how to pray to Allah? I don't need to be teached. My father has teached me years ago. May I come in, Colonel? Good morning, Sir. The situation is very difficult, Captain. Your company is our only hope. I get it, Colonel. With all respect… Nicolaich... if anything happens... please don't leave my family! Don't worry, Andrey. Well, break your leg… Oh, Lieutenant, Why so sad? You don't speak much, do you, Lieutenant. Well, have you ever been in love? Does your heart ache for anyone? Don't know. You are like a baby. I've got to go. Sergey… Forgive me please… okay? For what? Silly, you don't understand, do you? I've been waiting… I've been hoping… Anechka... darling... I wish you knew how much... I want to tell you… Oh, God. Honey, don't say anything. I'll be gone in three days. My replacement is coming. What? How? Come on guys, come on faster! Come on guys! Lift it up! To 51 one from 303. A control passage is finished. All quiet. Got it. Getting down to work. - Lieutenant Stozharov! - Yes. Get some scouts, check out that hollow, then place outposts. Got it. Come on! - Platoon number three! - Yes! AGS and CLIFF place on the flancks. Got it! Foreman! MORTATS place in the hollow. Quickly, guys! The work is done, getting back to the base. Faster, faster guys! We have work to do! Come on, come on! Well the weather there is insane. One minute it's breathless heat, other minute is pouring rain. I hope there will be no snow… Otherwise we will never be getting back-up… Soldiers, wrong thoughts! Nikita, hey, Nikita! What? Listen, if I'll be injured, shoot me, okay? Don't leave for foes. Oh, get off. You better look up. I am! Sergeant… Sergeant… Don't worry, I'll shoot you. Sergeant, for how long is this drag? I think, even my sons will see it. Hey, Rakita, what the hell are you doing here? Huh? Couldn't stay a t home? I want to earn money for an apartment. Ohhh… as for me, I'm gonna be a cop after all that shit. Or maybe a racketeer. Well, Rakita, you'll never earn for an apartment here… As I can see, the only thing I can earn is hemorrhoids. I'm gonna take a nap. Okay. While the international terrorists are far away... Don't you remind me, what Army breeds in a soldier, son? The Army breeds three most important things… detestation for work, good sleep and wild appetite. Well the sleep is the most important. It gets us close to freedom. But, it's too soon for you to think about things like that. Now it's a retreat for everyone. Yakshi ma, private Azaryonok? Aye, big yakshi, Corporal! All those dumpasses out there go to the parties with our girls. And we are here. I wish I could put them all in our shoes and bring here. When I get back home, no one of them will dare to say something to me - kill them all. - Shut up! Killer! We can't let our opponents pass. We won't. Are you sure? Don't freak out, we gonna break through. Don't fire until they are on minefield. Now we are going to smash them. We've been waiting for you… Oh, don't hurry up! You didn't have enough in Afgan so you came here, you son of a bitch. Typhoon, Typhoon, i'm Granite, over! Captain, Captain! The back-up isn't coming yet! Battalions are still on the march! Oh hell… Allah akbar! Akbar all right! Krasulin, soldier, damn you. What are you waiting for? Shoot! You are a pussy. Nikita! go to Lieutenant! Tell him that they are going around us on the right, got it? Act according to the situation. Shit. I'm Kurbashi's mate. There are Russians. They've dug in. Come up with mortars or we will never get them! Silin, Silin, Ruslan has ordered to outflank them. Regroup. Get back. They got quiet, they are on to something. Already miss them? Don't worry, they'll come soon. What the hell we are doing here? What are we waiting for, huh? It's time to get out of here! Hey, Kaum, stop panicking. Yakshi, we take orders. They order we do. Captain we've got a captive. He says he is russian. I'm a former officer. An officer can't be former! Why not? Is it because we have a duty? All life long we hear only one thing: duty, duty... Shut up! What is this duty about? No money, no home, no glory. Segey let him go. Get up, come on. Everyone has it's own path. Are you alright? Well, happy baptism of a battle fire. Have you seen that, huh? Easy. They got acquainted well with russian paratroopers! Only mountains are cooler than us! Only stars are higher. Have you killed our people? Have you killed our people? Yours? Only in the fight. Wait. You smoke? Yes. Now, come on, yell your «Allah akbar». Fuck you… Go fuck yourself! Guys, I'm from Moscow! Are there any countrymen? There are! Show your face, I'll shoot you. Let's have a talk. Okay! Hey, Kaum, don't be stupid, you're even not from Moscow. What's the freaking difference? (swears in Tatar) Let's live and don't die. Hello, countryman! (swears in Tatar) What the hell? Oh, I thought I'm dead. He is a huge man. Damn... my face... What's wrong with you? I'm thirsty. Well serve yourself. I have a grenade on me. Where's the pin? Don't know. Look at you. You wanted to blow yourself, soldier? So I don't get to captivity. It could've been used. Perkale. You think I'm a coward, don't you? Don't you? Don't fuss. Oh, mother, it hurts… it hurts… Ma-ma... Krasulin… You are a dumbass don't stand up! What are you doing? Attack! Go on, we'll back you up. Attack! Get it, get it. Attack! Attack! It's ok, Andrey. Get him. We'll give you an injection, okay? Calm down, dumbass. We got it, okay? I'm not killed, I'm wounded, am I? You'll go home soon. To your mother, to your girlfriend. Just hold on, Andrey, hold on. I'm alive, yeah? Alive, alive, just hold on. It's cold…. Come on, we'll get you to the hospital. Typhoon, Typhoon, I’m Granite. Typhoon, Typhoon, I’m Granite, copy, copy. Capitain, we'll never make it without artillery. Yes, I can see it. Captain, Typhoon! Typhoon, Typhoon, I'm Granite. I'm fighting against superior forces. We need artillery. Right now. We need artillery, immediately. Copy, copy, Granite. Hold on, the back-up is coming. Over. I need fire!!! Immediately!!!! I've got plenty of wounded and killed! Get me fire! Got it, Granite, got it. The back-up is coming. When will...? The back-up is coming. Get me fire! Got it, Granite, got it. The back-up is coming. Go fuck yourself! Maybe we cover them with an artillery, Commander? It's too soon. Let the enemy stuck in there. Otherwise, we'll mess it up. It's very tough for them! Tell me about that! My bad. I just can't, can't lose guys like that. Fifteen, Fifteen! How long are you going to drag yourself? Forward, march! Granite, Granite, I'm Berku! We are not going to make it! We can't hold on! Captain, Lieutenant Selivanov is calling for help. They are being surrounded by the enemy. Mytarin! Get some people and go to Selivanov! If it'll be too tough then come here. Faster, faster, guys! Rakita and three more guys after me, now! Come on, come on, guys! You'll be fine! You, stubborn bitches! Colonel, what decision did you take about back-up for Kartzev? You are getting on my nerves! I'm not a wizard! Got it? Got it. You are being too smart, you dumbass. And please, you are supposed to shave, Captain. If I see you one more time like that, I'll penalty you, got it? Got it, Colonel. Now you are free to go. Fedor! Any news from guys? Don't know yet… It's bad, isn't it? Well, don't be upset so soon. It's no order yet... But I bet it'll be soon!!! Semyon! Are you sleeping? Thinking. Wake up! Wake up! I am. What is it? Get the copter! Get the copter! Are you nuts, Captain? You out of your mind? A sudden desire for heroism? We need to save our boys! You are the only hope for us, Semyon! Okay, Cap. We're gonna go under the Tribunal. We're gonna get suspended from the Army. Well, it's for the best. Maybe our lives will be more calm. Well! Don't play for time! You are a lazy cockroach! Don't yell, Cap, we'll try. Maybe we'll slide in. Cockroaches are tenacious. Fedor! Captain! Fedor! Take me with you! I'm begging you! I can't! Wait… Stozharov! What do you think you doing? Stop it immediately! I'm ready to answer for it! But later, after I save our guys! For God's sake! You make me responsible for this! I'm going to be brought to account! You make me accountable! Get out, now! Well, go. Help our guys, Fedor, as much as you can. May the God be with you! Fedor, tell Sergey that I love him! Oh God, help them, please! Please help them! Please! Berkut, berkut, I'm Granite! I'm granite, do you read me? Captain, we are not going to make it! Hold on, guys! Hold on! Don't step back until we get the wounded away. Got you. Boris, take them all. Take all men and go! I'll cover you! Go! All of you! Ivolgin, go! Rakita, Rakita! Move on, forward! They are leaving! Block them with fire, now! Selivanov, hold on! Can you hear me? Over, over! Do you read me? Selivanov, hold on! Don't step back! Don't step back... What will I do now? Well, Russian, done fighting, huh? I have… my son is born!... Ivan called. They are fine. Father is with him. He said they were sitting and talking. And I think I know what he is doing… Eating stewed cherries! What is Alexey Ivanovich doing there? Is he on mission? No, he arrives to Moscow today. Well, how is our Selivanov The Third doing? Kicking his legs? He is Doctors say it's okay. Thank God. Typhoon, Typhoon, I'm Ganite! Captain, we need to leave this height. What are you taking about, Lieutenant? We need to save at least those who are still alive! Look at you, being smart? Captain, please listen to me! It's our people! We are responsible for them! We have an order, Lieutenant. An order to stay here. Do you think that I'll go away and leave my guys here after I lost half of them? They've given up on us! Mytarin, if you've shitted your pants go hide yourself behind the rock and then shoot yourself like a man. I'll tell that you died in a fight. And if you run I'll shoot you myself. Where are the copters? Where is the artillery? Why should we die for them? Have you forgotten, son of a bitch? Forgot that you have a military rank? I'll remind you, son of a bitch! Glover, Glover answer me! Glover!... Glover, Glover answer me! Glover!... Don't overstain your voice. Those jackals destroyed Glover's group. How many of them? Killed? All of them. Ruslan, don't panic. There're not so many Russians out there. I've lost many of my people, don't you get it? We must break through now. Like that - we won't. There is no other way out. The Federals are going to destroy us with the artillery! We have time right for a shell flight. Go and attack! It's useless. We must negotiate. We need to try. Bribe russians or scare them off! It won't work with the paratroopers you know it yourself! At least we need to try to negotiate, General! Go, boss, go and negotiate with them. You are from the Academy, they'll listen to you. Agree for any of their terms. We're not going to die here. Can you hear me? Lola, Lola, do you have him in sight? Russian is taken to aim. Andrey, it's you? Well, hello. Hello, Murad, hello... Are you still a Captain? Well, you know me, I'm not into licking somebody's boots. What do you want? Listen... There are more than two thousand of us here. You have no chance. If you want to save your soldiers you need to leave the height. I remember in Afgan, Murad most of all we were afraid of a shame of betrayal. And now you are suggesting it to me? I'm sorry for you. Don't be sorry for me! Be sorry for yourself! You are an Officer, Murad. Look at you. How could you live like that, betraying yourself? I don't understand it, Murad, and I don't want to! Lola Lola, shoot both of them! I said shoot, shoot, you bitch. I must kill the mad jackal. We're blood brothers. We have one religion, we need to stand by each other… Be a man and pray… Wait, don't kill me… I'll do anything I swear on my mother's name. Pray. That's all I can do for you. Besmalla, besmalla, besmalla… Why so sad, son? Huh? Missing home? Home and maybe something more… Don't worry. You'll be awarded soon, get a medal. You make either a hole in your jacket either in your forehead. Don't croack, Kaum. Will we hold on, Sergeant? What else could we do? Here, have a drink. Singing in Tatar. You hear that? It's copters! Are buzzing, listen! Our copters are coming! We are here! Brothers! We are here! They've come, they didn't give up on us! Guys, guys, follow me! Zero five plus, fire! Get the wounded on board! Now! We made it! God does exist after all… Where is my brother? Where is Sergey? Fedor! Fedor, brother! Where did it hit you? In my side… It hurts… Just don't leave me please! What's wrong with you? Stop it. Don't be ridiculous, you hear me? Anuyta is waiting for you. You hear me? You'll see, we'll be celebrating on your wedding! It feels good to be with our people... Don't leave me Sergey! It's not possible... Sergey... You hear me, Sergey? Why is it only one copter? Where's the back up? Where're the ammunition? Oh, I'd say where… In the shithole! Kaum, do you have cartridges? No... No one has, don't you see? So, guys, what do we have? We have nothing to defend with. So we have only one choice: either die... either captivity. But what about back-up? It won't get here on time. What do you have in mind? What are we going to do? I'm not giving up. I'll fight till the end. Dying at 19 years old is not a very good perspective… The point is not about the age you die at, it's about how you die. The best way is to die like a real men. So... We can't let those jackals break through. We need to defy the artillery on ourselves. And then we go into hand-to-hand. They won't have time to take us prisoners because our guys are going to hit them. At least we'll get a nice last workout. Hold on... Out of shells, huh? Are you scared, dear? Fearfully? No, mostly offended. You've got balls, Cap. You don't seem nervous. Did you fight in Afganistan? I did. Do you want to live? Throw him off the steep. He's out of his mind! He doesn't want to live at all! Everything's going to be alright, believe me. We'll get you food and a girl. Why do you need him, Cap? I'll give you a life! You have my word of on Officer. The Officer?… Typhoon, Typhoon, I'm Granite you hear me? Over. Granite, Granite, I copy you, over. Typhoon, Typhoon, I'm drawing enemy's fire upon myself! I take the enemy's artillery upon myself! Goodbye, guys! For the Great glory of Russia! Command, Colonel… Do it. What is that, Rusinov? My grandmother gave it to me. She said if it gets too hard, light this up. You have a really wise Grandmother, Rusinov. Let’s go, Kaum, huh? These bitches will remember the Russian paratroopers die. Come on, don’t be afraid. It’s them who should be afraid. They can’t kill us twice anyway. He must be somewhere… Must be… Who? My son! Before the war I had so much fun! So at least one son of mine must be somewhere. Had a lot of fun, huh? Up to the neck! Then he should be somewhere there. Well, guys, let’s go? Oh yeah, it’s our time.
