(distant male voice) Lily... Where are you, Lily? Lily! Where are you? [bell rings] Lily! Lily... Where are you, Lily? Lily... Lily! I'm coming, Grandma! Come on, Joey. I've been callin' and callin'. Ooh, look at you! You are filthy! And no shoes? Where's your brains? Your Granddad killed a four-foot rattler down there only last week. Really? Yeah. Watch your feet on these thorns here. And you know, there's water moccasins down there, too. You gotta listen to me Lily... You do. You could at least wear shoes. Hey, Grandpa. What'd ya get me today? Hey, Sunshine. Where's Grandpa's hug? Is it M & M's? Nothin. I didn't get you nothin'. Grandpa, what did you get? Please tell me? - Edna. - Hey. Not until after you've cleaned up. Now, hurry, the food's ready. Oh, Grandpa, you're kidding with me. I know you got me something. Come on. Thanks! Lily, not until after supper. You hear me? I want you to wash up so you can help Grandma set the table. Thomas, not till after you clean up. You got to set an example. All right, all right. I'm goin'. * It's cold tonight down by the river * * The wind is whistlin' thru the pines * * We walked here so many times together * * I can almost feel your hand in mine * Guess what I built today? What did you do? I built a carpet room made of moss. You did? Mmm hmm. And it felt so good under my feet. Then, I fell asleep... And I had that dream again, you know, the one about the ocean? Mmm hmm. I always wake up before I see it. - You do? - Mmm hmm. Then I hear that voice calling my name. Do you think it was Daddy's voice? Well, what do you think? I know it was him - it had to be. Tell me about the ocean? Lily, Grandma tells you this story every single day. Don't you ever get tired of it? I know, but I want to hear it again. All right, well... When your daddy was-- Hey! Hi, sweetie. How's my little girl? Good. Did you have any good adventures today? Yes? Oh! Not before dinner. Edna...Thomas is spoiling her. No, he isn't. It's just a 'weeee' little bit of candy. Hello, everybody. Big day! Big, big day! Mmmm, I'm starvin'. Smells good. It is good. Lily, why don't you come over here and give your soon-to-be Daddy a big kiss? You're not my Daddy yet. He will be, Lily. Don't be ugly. Sweetheart... Dean just wants to be a good Daddy to ya. Okay? That's all. Now you go apologize. I'm sorry. Well, now, that's okay, Pumpkin. You'll get used to me, then we'll all be just one big happy family. Yeah, I hope so. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, the blessing thing. Dear Lord, Bless this food we are about to receive. Thank you for the blessings that you have bestowed upon us. Amen. Amen. Ah, ah, Lily. Just take what you're gonna eat, Pumpkin. Did y'all hear about Copeland Franks? He spotted that panther, over there near his cabin. That stupid Indian. Why don't he just kill the damn thing? That's just like an Indian. Dean, they'll be no cursin' at my dinner table. Sorry, Thomas. I just can't stand Indians. And as for Copeland Franks - he's one of the best trackers I've ever seen. He is also one of my closest and dearest friends. Okay, but-- Grandpa, guess what I built. Well, let me guess. Umm, I bet you built a boat. We need a new boat. No, Grandpa. I didn't build a boat. I made a carpet room. I put moss all over the ground. It took me all day, and I did it down by the creek. Down by the creek! Lily, how many times do you have to be told? There are snakes down there - and not to mention that panther. I haven't seen a snake yet! And Joey, he won't let that old panther get me. Will you, Joey? Edna, why do you let her go down to that creek all by herself? I can't be watching her every minute. And you know she knows those woods, and she swims like a fish. And Joey isn't going to let anything happen to her. I know. I'm sorry, Edna. It's just... I could not stand it if something happened to her. Momma, I'm OK. Hey, is Donna coming tomorrow? Yeah. She and Betty are gonna come and get some good canning goods. She's gonna get some peaches, okra. She and Donna gonna be here first thing in the morning, bright and early. I cannot believe I have to work tomorrow. You can sell a lot of cars on the weekend. I know, but I am supposed to be planning the wedding reception. Baby, it can't happen soon enough for me. I say we run off and get married tonight. What do we need all this other stuff for? Because I want to have a church weddin' with all the trimmin's - and I want Lily to be there. I can't wait to see Donna. I haven't had anyone to play with in so long. Grandpa, do you believe that the creek flows to the ocean? Yeah, it could. Take the creek a few miles down to the river. I reckon it'd take about a week. Why? I want to go there so bad. If I close my eyes I can hear the sounds of the waves, and the seagulls. I can almost smell it. Does it smell fishy? Joey, what do you think it's like at the ocean? Do you think that Daddy will know I'm there? We'll go there someday. Just you, me and Andrew. Momma can go too, if she can get some time off work. And I don't want her to bring you-know-who. Hi, baby. Hey, Momma. Here, let me wash your back. No. I can do it myself. Oooh... Gettin' too old for your Momma to baby you, huh? Honey, it scares me how fast you are growing up. Yep. I'll be grown up before you know it. Yeah, but you're always gonna be my baby girl. Now why don't you get out before you turn into a prune. Okay. Okay. [humming "My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean"] Guess what, Andrew? We're going to the ocean someday. Won't that be fun? And I can be closer to Daddy. Good night, Andrew. Hey, Joey, we can show Donna the carpet room. Do you think I'm stupid? Hmm? Do ya? No, sir. I know one thing. You lied to me about that dog. What did I say was gonna happen if you lied to me? Hmm? What did I say? I was gonna get a whippin'. You were gonna get a whoopin'. Now, let me ask you. Did you lie to me? - Did ya? - Yes. You did? Well... then we're gonna have to give you that whoopin'. I hate to have to do this, Lily. It's for your own good. These are critical years in a young lady's life. Now...I saw you feed that dog under the table. And if I ever see that again, the dog is gone. Do you hear me? That dog is dead! You hear me now? - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? Did you hear what I said? Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Yes. Yes? Yes. Yes, what? Yes, Daddy. Yes, Daddy. That's better. Now... Get down. Get down. [belt cracking] And if you mention this to anybody, well... Daddy loves you, Pumpkin. * Now, what kind of tree is that? Lily? Lily, are you listenin'? Sorry, Grandpa. That's an oak. That's good, that's good. How 'bout that one over there? Maple? All right, smarty pants. What kind of bird is that circlin' up there? Hawk. Boy, you're gettin' faster and faster. Pretty soon you're gonna be quicker than me. I won't have anything left to teach you. What's the news on that panther? I heard her this morning. She sounded real close. Yeah, she is. Them poachers been trappin' out her food supply. She'll be going after the livestock pretty soon - or even worse. Hey, lookie there. Ya'll made fire. Hey, Lily, what do ya say we ask Copeland to give us our new lesson for the day. We were about to learn how to tell time from the sun. Will you be our teacher today? I'd be proud to. Now you lower your arm, until it's just level with the horizon. Now, what time is it? Six a.m. - I believe you've got it. - Grandpa, I got it. Hey, I knew you could do that. Lily, I want to give you something. I've had it since I was your age. My Grandpa gave it to me. It's a compass. You can find your way no matter where you are. Of course, you know what to do if you're lost and you lose it? I do. The moss grows on the north side of the tree. The sun rises in the east, and it sets in the west. And I can always locate the North Star at night. I'll never lose it. Now, come on - let's see if we remember what y'all just learned. Hands to the center of the sky. Now lower your arm... level with the horizon. Ooh, look at you! I haven't seen you in weeks. And look how big you've gotten! I've grown a lot, Grandma. Where's Lily? Well, now she's off with Grandpa on their Saturday adventure. Probably down there in the woods, which you know is no place for a little girl. But you know how much she loves it. She can't wait to see you. I'm gonna call her. Lily! Thomas! Company! I brought those jars for canning. Good. I got some more goodies for ya. And I got a nice cold pitcher of sweet tea waiting for you, and a hot apple pie right out of the oven for you, missy. Oh, there goes my helper. Hi, Lily. How are you? Hey, Thomas, look who's here. Hi. Good to see ya, girl. You're just in time for planting. Oh, he's puttin' me to work already. Oh, Thomas, behave yourself now, honey. She just got here. Ms. McClain said tell y'all both hi. Oh, Ms. McClain, she has a crush on your Daddy. Oh, no... Do you know what Grandpa told me? No. What? He says that if I follow the creek that I can get to the ocean. Do you believe that? That's hard to believe. How long would it take you to get there? I don't know for sure. Maybe a week or so. But I know I'm going. Oh, Lily, what happened?! Nothing. I fell. How did you fall? That looks awful. Does it hurt? It's okay, really. Please don't tell Momma. I wouldn't want her to worry. And besides, she wouldn't let me come to the creek anymore. Why don't you tell my Momma? She could help make them better. You need medicine. Promise! Okay, I promise. Grandpa, about the ocean - have you ever seen it? I have. Is it beautiful and peaceful there? It's beautiful. It's probably one of the prettiest places I've ever seen. Maybe we'll take you there someday. About Daddy... Do you think he'll ever come back? I mean...he got lost at sea, right? And I know he was one of the best sailors in the United States Navy. Lily, your Daddy - he loved the ocean. He knew all his life what he wanted to do. He was happy being a sailor. I wish we can go today. I'd never feel hurt... or afraid of anything. Lily. Lily! What you doin', baby? He was really handsome. Yeah. You remind me so much of him. He loved the outdoors, too. He couldn't kill a thing. Never was a hunter... but he was a sailor though. He would be so proud of you. Do you still miss him? Yes. And I will always miss him. I loved him more than anyone ever knew. He could make me laugh at the smallest, silliest things. But...I have Dean now. Honey, he just wants to be a good Daddy to you. That's my Daddy. That's my only Daddy ever. Come here, sit up. Baby... Dean is not trying to replace William. Okay? No one can replace William. No one can replace him in my heart either. Just don't make me call him Daddy. Tom and Edna, good night. Now you drive careful, you hear? I will. Mr. Strickland, good night. Good night, Dean. Jenny, you hurry back in. Thomas, I'm not a little girl. I know what I am doing. I know. But you'll always be like a daughter to me. I just want you to be careful. Come on, Dad. Dean. Dean. Oh, what happened? When I look into your eyes... Never mind. Mmm, that's mine. I have to go. I have to go, too. Not much longer. I can't wait much longer. Where are you, Lily? * Is she lonesome now? * * Is she all alone? * * I wonder where that good gal's gone * * Hear the whistle blow * * Hear the tracks moan * * I hear that train comin' home * * Lonesome is the name * * Of the northbound train * * The hills are green where she's gone * * She made up her mind * * To leave sorrow behind * * On her way back home * * There is a place * * Where her shining face still smiles * * Does she sing a glad song * * Or is she sad I'm gone? * * I hear her voice laugh in a dream * * How near she seemed * * When she whispered her sad farewell * You know, Joey, it's not far 'til we make it to the river. We'll be there in no time. My Bonnie lies over the ocean My Bonnie lies over the sea My Bonnie lies over the ocean Bring my Bonnie back to me My Bonnie lies over the ocean My Bonnie lies over the sea My Bonnie lies over the ocean So bring back my Bonnie to me To me, to me... Did I hear some sweet bird singin' in the mornin' light? Oh, he's a charmer. Always smells good in this kitchen. Sure does. How did you sleep last night? That's all I get is one little peck on the cheek? I sure did miss my baby last night. I missed you, too. I missed you bad. Thomas! Lily! Breakfast! Y'all sit down now. Yes, ma'am. We got orange juice, or you can have tomato juice. Uh, orange, please. Okay. - Orange? - Yes. Well, you're already back? I thought you just left. Thomas, where's Lily? Uh, I didn't see her this morning. I figured she was sleepin' in. Well... Okay. Lily! Get down here this instant! She is probably down there by that creek again. I'll go get her. I'll go get her. I got some uh, eggs - cheese in 'em for you. Thank you. I do not know what it is gonna take. She just won't mind me anymore. I'm tellin' ya. You gotta be stern with her. All she needs is some good old-fashioned discipline. That's the way my dad handled it. We all knew better. God, he used to beat us silly. And if we kept at it, things started disappearing... our toys, our pets. My dog, one morning - gone. What do you mean, disappearing? I mean that was the last time I saw 'em. He just disappeared. Oh, you know, we knew he shot 'em-- Enough! I do not want to hear any more. What? How cruel, Dean. And you call that discipline? What did I say? * Some day I will drift away * * Down the rivers and the streams * * And when I find the ocean * * I'll be home * [panther roars in distance] Did you hear that, boy? We have nothin' to worry about. She can't get us over here. Cats are afraid of water. Lily! I can feed you anytime I want... and nobody would care. Dear Momma... I don't want you to worry. I love you so much. I am very sorry that I have been a burden lately. I want to see the ocean. I want to see what Daddy saw. I just want to be close to my Daddy now, and I'm for sure that nothing can hurt me there. Hurt me there? I am glad to see you so happy, but I think it's better this way. I will send you... a postcard soon. Promise. I love you. Lily. She's gone. We know. The boat's missin'. I mean...she's gone. She's...she's run away. You don't really think that she would try to get to the ocean, do you? I mean, can she do that? What does she mean, 'no one will hurt her there?' Hurt her? Daddy? I would never hurt her... and I would never let anybody else hurt her. Edna, call the sheriff. I will. Let's go. Let's go call him, honey. I'll call him, I'll call him. Oh, hurry, please, Henry. Thank you. Whoa! What's with the gun? It's only precautionary. Are you comin'? Uh...yeah. Everything's gonna be fine, Jenny. I called Copeland. He's gonna meet me at the creek with his boat. Okay. C'mon, Sooner. How long does it take to set a trap? How long? Till I get done. We are going south. That's the right direction. I wonder what time it is? It's about eight o'clock. I can do it, Joey. I can tell time by the sun. We better go get some more water before we go. Hey, McGee! There's a snake. Where? Where? This'n right here. Damn it, Adams, don't you start with me. This is serious. A little girl's missing. I know. Gosh, why you gotta be so hard-nosed all the time? Just messin' with ya. Wait up, Joey! Oww!! Go get the stick. - Hey. - Hey. You hear that panther growlin' this mornin'? Yep, sure did. You know, we gettin' closer every day. I hope we git him soon. His hide would bring a purdy penny. It sure would. But after tonight we're gonna have to lay off this trappin' for a while. I got a bad feelin' that this sheriff is close to our scent. Yeah, he probably is. [panther roars] Did you hear that? Sure did. Sounds like she's gettin' close. C'mon. This is where she went in. She probably didn't use the motor at first. It's pretty shallow up here. Yeah, she doesn't have a lot of gasoline. I figure she'll wait 'til she hits the river to use the motor. When do you think she hit the river? Knowing Lily, I'd say early this mornin'. She's quick and she knows her way around the water. She got a big jump on us. Just tell me what you want me to do, Thomas. That little girl is special to all of us. Thanks, Reverend. We're gonna need everyone on this - especially the good Lord. Would you do me a favor and keep an eye on Edna? I don't want her here worrying by herself. All right, but you call us as soon as you find her. Now, before we set out on this important mission, could we all say a prayer? Bow your heads, please. Thank you, Lord, for being with Lily today. Thank you for being with us. Bless the Strickland family for the safe return of their grandchild. Cradle her in your safe arms so Jenny can cradle her again in hers. Guide us swiftly and directly. In Jesus' Name. Amen. All right, Adams, take some of these men, get a couple dogs, cover that side of the creek. McGee, you get some men, you scout this side. I'm going up to the house to check on Edna. Jenny, she'll be all right. Have faith. Thank you, Reverend. Sheriff, Copeland! You better come quick! What you got, Tim? Oh, Lord. These tracks are fresh - about a half a day old. Big one, too. And she's headed downstream. I can't lose her, too. I just can't. She is everything to me. Oh, baby... It's okay. We'll find her. Well, lookie there what we done caught in the trap, son! I guess I done won that bet. I guess you did. Look at that pretty golden hair. Look at her leg, Emmit. She's hurt bad. What we gonna do with her? She'll get us in some real trouble for sure. You shut up! Well, now, little girl... looks like we got ourselves a real problem here. Help me. Please. No, no. Now listen up. I mean, we could let you go, but then you'd be in on our little secret. Now, if you stay with us, probably come in kinda handy. And we could learn you somethin'. This your rabbit, little girl? He sure is fat. Make a good stew, he will. No! No, please...he's a pet. He's not a wild one. Don't hurt him. I promise I won't say anything. Is that your dog? Hey, boy. Aagh, he tried nippin' at me. Sooner, kill that dog. - All right. - Kill 'em! I guess we're gonna have to teach you some manners. No! [gun fires] Put the gun down. You too. Don't even think about that knife in your boot. Now you guys get out of here. My rabbit! Let the rabbit go. Hey, we just found her here. We was just tryin' to help. Ain't that right, Sooner? Yeah, sure. Ya'll just get on away from here... before I lose my temper. Go on! Okay. Whoa! You're hurt pretty bad. I'm gonna take it off. It's gonna hurt you. Hold on. Okay. I want you to stand up for me. Can you try that? Come on. You're a big girl. You can do it. Stand up. Good girl, good girl. Let's try to walk. What's your doggie's name? - Joey. - C'mon Joey. We got to get us some shotgun shells. And we need us a couple new guns, too - remember? Of course I remember, you idiot. Have you heard anything else about Lily Strickland? No, not this afternoon. All the town men are out looking for her. You know the panther was heard over by their house last night. Oh, Lord. What's gonna happen to her? I can't imagine a little girl lost in those woods. I just don't know what else that family can handle. They lost a son a few years ago. He was a fine boy. He was in the Navy. It just took forever for Jenny to get over that. What she must be going through. You know, those poachers been settin' up traps everywhere. That's why that cat is so close in. What if she gets in the trap first? Well, the panther really will get to her. Lordy mercy. What's this world comin' to? Well, I've been prayin' for Jenny and her daughter. They've had such a hard life. I better be goin'. If y'all hear anything will you let me know? Sure thing. Thanks. - Howdy. - How are you boys? Did I hear you say that somebody was missin'? Thomas Strickland's granddaughter. - No! - Yeah. Well, who all they got lookin' for her? The sheriff got a search party together. They're meetin' up down at the mouth of the river, I think. You boys wanna help? Well, sure we do. - Don't we, Sooner? - Sure. I'd hate for anything to happen to that little girl. Of course, we're gonna need a couple of rifles... Uh, that shotgun and that one with the scope on it. Seein's how both our guns were stolen just today. - Stolen?! - Yes, ma'am. What in the world? Well, I tell you - things just aren't safe anywhere anymore. That first rifle, and that shotgun next to it. Sure thing. Thank ya. What else for you boys? How 'bout two boxes of .00 buck for this, and a 30.06 for that one. Okay. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, ma'am, where did you say that sheriff was meetin' up with that search party? I think they'll be meetin' up at the mouth of the river. We'll see what we can do. Yeah, we'll see what we can do. All right, boys, we're camping here. No. Wait. We have to keep going. What if she's hurt? Lily wouldn't do anything to jeopardize that dog or the rabbit. She knows how to survive off the land. She knows how to stay out of sight. We ain't gonna find her tonight, honey. Do you think she's all right? I mean, what if she's scared? Jenny, she's a brave little girl - just like you were. The way her father was. Come on. Let's get some rest. We're camping here? All night? [panther roars] (Sheriff) Here we are, right here. I feel that Lily is no farther than here. Hopefully, she rested in this radius right here. If we spread out, there's no way we're gonna miss her. Yeah, but if I know Lily, she left before sunrise. She wouldn't let night cover stop her. She knows where she is by the stars. I'm afraid she got more of a lead on us than you think. Yeah, maybe you're right. But we've got men and dogs on both sides of the creek. We got ten boats in the water. We've radioed the ports... and it's on the news. I don't think there's any way that we won't find her sometime today. Maybe we can put a stop to all this crazy behavior once and for all. I am about an inch away from-- I don't know what it is that you think you're gonna teach her, Dean. Well, how about not to run off? Maybe she ran away from you. You got something to say about that? Look, I don't know what you're saying-- Thomas, he's just trying to help. Dean would never hurt Lily, and you know that. You're just tired. Hey, Sheriff, could I talk to you a minute? It's okay. Y'all excuse me for a minute. Thomas. Well, that's when we seen her. That little blond girl was puttin' up a fuss - kickin' trying to git away from that man. And we went to shoot at him and that colored done shot at us first. What do you mean he shot first? He shot at us, told us not to come no closer. Then he told us to put our guns down. We didn't wanna do that, and then he shot at us again. What did he do with Lily? Mr. Strickland, we don't know. He made us run off... and he kept our guns. You should've heard that little girl screamin' - I mean, all the way up the hill. Who was he? Do you know him? He's that tugboat captain, Amos Jackson. Amos Jackson? I know Amos Jackson. He wouldn't hurt nobody. Ya'll sure you got the right man? Yes, sir. What would Amos Jackson want with my granddaughter? You know what they say, sir. No. What do they say? About them coloreds... the way they like them little white girls. Stop it! Stop it now! Watch your temper, Grandpa, before you get hurt! You watch your mouth, boy! I don't know what's going on here, but it's the only lead we got. Now we're gonna find Amos Jackson. We're gonna get some answers. I'm sure there's an explanation for all of this. Yeah, I'm sure there is. Thomas! Not now, Thomas. We're wastin' time. Thomas, come on. Now you boys need to go on and get out of here. There's been a lot of poachin' goin' on around here. Sure would hate to think you boys knew anything about that. How 'bout you, Sooner? I don't know nuthin' about no poachin', Sheriff. We just tryin' to help is all. We just heard about that little girl missin' up at Bertie's Store. She told us we might could find y'all down here. Y'all just go on, get on out of here. We'll take it from here. Diggin' for ginseng - I don't believe that for one minute. How long? Yesterday afternoon, maybe. Three, maybe four o'clock. Wow, is this it? Is this your boat? Yeah. That's the Anna Marie. Take your time. Your ankle hurt? Come on down, watch your step. Robert, Henry! This is Lily. Hi, Lily. Joey! Come on, boy! Joey, what's the matter? What do you see, boy? Joey, come on. Joey, c'mon now. Lily, don't move. Be still. Now, boy! C'mon! Henry, cut us loose! Robert! Man, y'all should've been there. I mean we tried to stop him, but he dang near killed both of us! Yeah, but he missed. No joke he missed, numb nut. That's why we sittin' here talkin' 'bout it today. Yeah, but he really was mad. Oh, yeah. You know, he took that little girl's big ole black rabbit and her yellow dog. What did he want with that little girl, anyway? Ain't quite for sure on that one. Dadburn it, Emmit. What'd you think a big black man want with a little white girl? Do I have to spell it out for you? Aw, no. Darn! Well, we're gonna do somethin' about this boys. I think the Sheriff... he didn't even believe us, 'cause he and Amos, they've been friends, anyhow. We probably gone have to have some kind of proof. Proof! We'll show him proof! Proof nothin'. Boys, we got a job to do. Wooo! Whoo, ha! Hell, yeah. We gonna teach that colored not to mess with us Johnson boys. That little girl is big trouble. But now... we gonna take care of both 'em at the same dang time. Yeah, we'll show 'em. We'll show 'em. What are we gonna do, Emmit? Well, nothin' just yet. You just sit back and relax, son. You'll see. Hey, Sheriff... I found this. Oh, man. Those are Lily's pants. There's blood on them! Now, Jenny, Jenny. Don't lose control. There was blood in the trap, too. Maybe there's another explanation for all of this. I just don't know what to think anymore. I just... I just want her back. Oh, my. What do you make of that, Copeland? The panther was here a couple hours ago. It looks like Lily's dog, Joey, was here, too. The cat tracks come out right over here, and the rest of 'em go down on the dock. Probably on Amos' tugboat right now. The next stop down river would be Peabody Docks. I'm gonna stay behind y'all. That cat's close. It's probably watching us right now. I'll catch up to y'all later. Do you want some men to go with you? I reckon I could use some help. All right, McGee, Adam... Come on, go with Copeland. We'll catch up with you down at Peabody Docks. All right, men, we're gonna get goin' in just a minute. We gotta head down river. Everything was so good. I'm so glad y'all enjoyed everything. Here you go. Now would you like a piece of pie? Would you like peach or apple? I would like peach, please. Peach. All right, sweetie. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - See ya later, Gina. - Y'all come back. Amos, why is everybody staring? Hi, Amos. How are you? Hi, Gina. How are you? I'm doing fine. And who is this we have with us? This is our new tugboat captain. Well, y'all let me know if you need anything. Sure. I appreciate it. Amos, you didn't answer my question... Why's everybody staring? Lily, it's just the way things are. What do you mean? People are scared. Scared of what? Themselves, uh...change. They're scared of change. Well, Jesse? Well, you're all set to go, Amos. Next stop, Selma. Next stop, Selma. Somethin' on your mind, Jesse? Can I speak to you in private for a minute? About what? Lily, I want to talk to Jesse for a moment in private, if you don't mind. And when I get through we gonna head on down to Selma. Aye Aye, Captain. Thanks for the biscuits, Jesse. They're the best in Alabama. You're welcome, Lily. You come back and see me. I've known you a long time, Jesse. Is that correct? I know that look. What is it? Look, there ain't nothin' wrong right now, but listen. Everybody 'round here is talkin' about that little white girl you got with you. What do you mean with me? You mean a black man? Or should I say a nigger? Oh, come on now, Amos. You know me better than that. I ain't like that. But what is she doing with you? Why you talk like that to me? Does she look scared to you? Do you think I'd hurt her? Jesse, I found her in the woods - hurt, by herself. She was caught in a poacher's trap on her ankle. She couldn't walk. And them two idiots messin' around with her - I had to run 'em off. So I took her home with me. She's gotta have some relatives around here somewhere. Well, I reckon so. What kind of family is that? Somebody been beatin' on her. I'm tellin' ya, somethin's wrong. All right, I understand. But not everybody around here thinks like you and me. Oh? How is that? I just don't want to see you lose everything you've worked your whole life for. Really? All right, Jesse. I appreciate that. I thank ya, sir. I'll just watch my back. Okay? Hello! Hey. Hi, honey. Have you heard anything yet? I...I'm just worried sick. I don't know what would cause her to do something like this. I think I know. What? If you know something, you need to tell us. Donna? * People get ready * * There's a train a-comin' * * You dont need no baggage * * You just get on board * * All you need is faith * * Hear the diesels hummin' * * Don't need no ticket * * You just thank the Lord * * People get ready * * There's a train to Jordan * * Pickin' up passengers * * From coast to coast * * Faith is the key * * To open the doors and board them * * There's hope for all * * Among those who love the most * * So people get ready * * There's a train a-comin * * You dont need no baggage * * You just get on board * * Dont need no ticket * * You just thank the Lord * Amos, where is your family? Don't you have one? Well, yeah. I did have a family. Did you have kids? Yes, I did. Where are they now? They're in heaven. How'd they die? Well, Anna was about your age. And I was working at the docks. Marie was home with Anna and somethin' happened. No... No! No, no, no! Did they make it out? No. Did you think the color would rub off? Grandma says, we're all the same on the inside. God just took a big paintbrush and painted us all different on the outside. I just thought it would have been watercolors. C'mon, Emmit. It's gettin' dark. I don't know what it is, but somethin'-- somethin' just don't feel right. You just got the jitters 'cause of that little Strickland girl. We ain't gonna git caught, son. Once the clan catches up with that dang tugboat, that little girl'll be too scared to tell nobody 'bout us. Did you hear that? There's somethin' out there. Sooner, you're hearin' things. Now stop it. And don't go shootin' off that gun neither. You'll have the whole search party on us, quicker 'an bees on a hive. [panther growling] Don't move a muscle, boys. She's right there in front of ya. Drop the guns, boys. It's all over. We heard everything. We didn't mean to hurt nobody. Would you shut up, idiot? Huh? Yeah, but you did. And now you've got a whole county after an innocent man. Let's go. You're lucky we were here. Y'all would have ended up as her dinner tonight. God's paintbrush. Nathan! Be still, Lily. Look after Lily. Amos Jackson. Stop the boat! What do y'all want? We know you've got that little Strickland girl on there. Now pull aside! I don't know what you're talkin' about. Stop that boat, Amos, or we're gonna count you guilty. Guilty of what? Look, I gotta make a delivery. You want to talk to me, I'll be in Selma first light. We gave you fair warnin'. Next time it ain't gonna be so easy. Y'all better find some business of your own. Now the river gets narrow up ahead. You want to talk to me, like I said - I'll be in Selma. Now get on outta here. You ain't seen the last of us, Amos Jackson! Are you all right, Lily? Yeah. Are you? Who were those men? Those men won't bother us anymore tonight. Those small boats can't stay in our wake, so it's not a problem. Why don't you get some sleep? When do you sleep? I'll sleep tomorrow. Nathan, get some shut eye, okay? - You sure, boss? - I'm sure. Good night, Amos. I love you. I love you too, Lily. Jesse, I know Amos is a good friend of yours, but I just gotta find my granddaughter. I don't know if I should tell you anything. I don't know that you have a choice, Jesse. You see that woman over there? She's terrified. She doesn't know Amos Jackson like we do. She doesn't know what he wants with her little girl, either. Look, Sheriff, I don't want no trouble here. That little girl's been abused. What do you mean? Amos found her in a trap over in the forest. He saved her life. Why didn't he bring her home? Somebody beat her. That little girl ain't never had a spankin', much less a beatin'! Jenny, here's your coffee. You all right, Thomas? You son of a-- What! Thomas, don't! Get up. Get up and hit a man. You good for nothin'-- A man? You sucker-punched me. Thomas! What has gotten into you? Ask him! He knows what I'm talkin' about. What?! How could you hurt her? What did she ever do to you? It was him. He beat her, and she never said a word! What are you talkin'-- Dean, what is he talkin' about? He's a crazy old man. Dean? Lily? No one can hurt her. Oh, my God... What did you do to her? What? You bastard! What did you do to my child?! I didn't hurt her! I taught her how to behave! I did it for her, for you, for us. For us? I loved you. I loved you blind. I love you, too. What did she ever do to you?! No, no! Listen to me! She was just a little girl! Just a little girl! She was just a little girl... - I love you, Jenny. - Stay away from me. Stay away from you? I love you. I didn't know all of this was gonna happen. I wanted the best for us. I wanted to be right. I wanted to go drive in my car. You gotta believe me. Come on. Oh, my God. No... [police siren sounds] Okey dokey. What do you got here? I don't see the jerky here. You got the beef jerky in here? - Amos Jackson? - Yeah. You're under arrest for kidnapping. What? No! He didn't kidnap me! He saved my life! It's all right, Lily. It's all right. - What you lookin' at? - Nothin'. Nothin'? Well, you like little white girls, don't ya, boy? Amos! Amos! Amos! - Nathan, look after Lily. - Yes, sir. - Let go! - Amos. Today marks a turning point in history. The governor has declared a state of emergency. The National Guard has been called out. Everyone is preparing for the worst. Thousands of men, women and children are here to stand up for freedom. I believe this one needs some medical attention. What happened to you? She'll take care of you, sweetie. Are you that little girl that's been missing? He didn't kidnap me. I ran away from home and he saved my life. I have to get out of here. He's my friend. He'll be all right. Let's look at that ankle. Oh, let's get this cleaned up. You stay right here, precious. I'll be right back. All available officers are needed at the corner of Water and Broad - Immediately! Amos. Amos, wake up! Lily, what are you doin' in here? I came to save you this time, Amos. How you gonna do that - all them policemen down there? There's a bunch of 'em. - I'll be right back. - Lily? * To everything - turn, turn, turn * * There is a season - turn, turn, turn * * And a time to every purpose under heaven * * A time to build up * * A time to break down * * A time to dance * * A time to mourn * * A time to cast away stones * * A time to gather stones together * * To everything - turn, turn, turn * * There is a season... * Well, my goodness. Watercolors, Amos. Look at you. What you doin'? * A time to gain * * A time to lose * * A time to rend * * A time to sow * * A time for love * * A time for hate * * A time for peace * * I swear it's not too late * Now, Lily, you promised me you'd call your Momma and tell her where you was and how you was doin'. I'll keep my promise if you keep your promise. C'mon. Okay. [phone rings] Hello... Hello? Grandma, it's me, Lily. Lily! Lily, honey! Where are you? Are you all right? It's Lily. She's all right. You were very brave for tellin' us the truth about Lily. You saved so many people's lives. I'm just so proud of you. Lily, I need to talk to you. You don't have to be afraid anymore. Dean's gone. He can't hurt you anymore, Lily. What do you mean Dean's gone? Where is he? He's locked up where he can never hurt anybody again. Lily, I am so sorry. Where's Momma? Your Momma's been everywhere. She's in Selma right now. Momma's in Selma? I'll find her. I love you, Grandma. It's over... it's finally over. Are you all right? Momma? Momma! Momma! Lily! I'm so sorry, baby. Grandpa! Thank you, Mr. Jackson. You're welcome. She's a very good girl. I want to thank you for saving Lily's life. No, Thomas. This time... she saved mine. - God bless you. - Thank you, sir. Maybe we can get some fishin' in. I think it's a good idea. Thank you. Sheriff. Amos, sorry about all the trouble. Well, we'll work it out. Sometimes we have problems. I love you, Lily. [seagulls in distance] Amos... I want to thank you - for all the things you've done, for all you've taught me. You're the only one who'd listen to me. I'll never forget you, Amos. Well...you take care now. You hear me? All right then. Bye bye. Bye.
