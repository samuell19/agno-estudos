Whoo! Whoo! Thank you. We've been trying out new songs. I knew you'd be here. I didn't know I'd be here. Well, I felt you out there. Hey, Mish is here. Did you see Mish? Andrew's asleep in the dressing room. He'll wander out in a minute. God, you look amazing. Well, you always look amazing. I look like shit, Jake. No, not to me. Never. This is Chasman. Hiya. This is Jake. Best man in the world. Hiya. Uh, could I get you something to eat? How you doing, Sadie? No, thanks, Jake. Incredible out there tonight, huh? Pretty intense. So how you doing? Great. I heard you were with the Trucker. That true? For about half a second. You heard that? He's my man, you know. You heard that, huh? Oh, God. Heh-heh. God. Good to see you. You were great out there, man. So in-fucking-credibly great. You tear me up, you know? What did Dad used to say? "God kissed her. God kissed that girl." God, I'm glad you're here. Well. Well. Hey, Mish. Hey. I get a hug? Sure. You don't have to. No, sure. That was great. So are you drinking? You know me. Whatever's cheap or free. So you're here in Seattle? Looks like it. Hello. This is Chasman. Hi. He's with me. Oh? Came up from San Francisco. Saved my life. Oh. Hello. I'm a fan. So Sadie said you were her sister. Chasman's a promoter. Oh. What do you promote? Me. Sadie's among my clients. Yeah, my star client. I met Sadie in San Francisco. I'm from London originally. Oh? Balham. You can hear the accent. Where are you staying? Well, I thought, you know, I'd come home for a little maybe. Oh, that'd be great. Ferguson heard you were with Trucker. What, Hewitt Trucker? "I'm Gonna Make You Mine." Trucker, yeah. For about, half a minute, yeah. You're great. You were great tonight. What you do up there. Thank you. I know you think that sounds like bullshit. No. We're staying in town tonight. Let us get you a room at the hotel. Unless you... That's be great. So you're thinking of staying with us a little? Until I got settled. That's fantastic. I could help with the house. Well, maybe not. Has someone got an eye on Andrew? Andrew's fine. Mish, you wanna go see to Andrew? Sure. See you, Sadie. You bet. What are your plans? Chasman. He's gotta go back. Not tonight. No, not tonight. Not tomorrow, maybe, not either. It's a long ride. Well, we'll see, won't we? There's tons of food over there. Could I fix you a plate? Well, I was thinking of you guys actually. ♫ Whose honey are you? ♫ ♫ Whose tea do you sweeten? ♫ ♫ With sugar and spice ♫ ♫ And everything nice ♫ ♫ Depend upon you ♫ ♫ You got a tiny little touch ♫ ♫ Of heaven ♫ ♫ In her fingertips ♫ ♫ Singha beer ♫ ♫ Don't ask no questions ♫ ♫ Singha beer ♫ ♫ Don't tell no lies ♫ ♫ Singha beer ♫ ♫ Don't ask no questions ♫ I mean, it fired loud. But I didn't get hit by anything. He had guns everywhere. He just always thinks people are doing him in. And so he's always expecting, like, a siege. Mish? So everybody's out to get you. And also... germs. He has a thing about germs. And the faucet had to be right in the middle of the sink, or his life was ruined. Come on, you guys. You want me to take them? No, I'll take them. Well, Sadie's here. I'll take them. Andrew! Is there brown sugar? And he would do these midnight raids where he would look through the cupboards to see if I'd eaten anything. Mish. Are there any grapes? He's definitely multiple personalities. I mean, there were three main ones, and two were very mean. And then there were, like, subgroups. There you go, Druid. He'd roll a joint big as cigars. He was real nice when he smoked. He'd become really mellow. He could smoke two huge spliffs and still sing great. And, you know, he can be so wonderful. He can be such a fabulous singer. He has great vocal range, great breath control. You guys have about 20 minutes before you have to be out that door. That woman can sure as hell sing. As opposed to what? Did I say something? I didn't mean anything by it, Jake. Everything's Jake, Jake. Is she gonna stay? Don't know. Mish, you're gonna ruin your eyes. What are you doing? It's 8:00 in the morning. You need not to do that around the kids, okay? Wouldn't. I don't need to say I'm grateful I'm here. No, Sadie. How was the tour? It was great. I wasn't on the tour. Oh? I don't manage the band anymore. No? Not for six years, Sadie. You don't know what the hell I do, do you? I do. Sure, I do. You are so fucked. I do! I teach and I write. I knew that. I want to start working the farm. I like doing stuff with my hands. They think they own her. I'd be walking around, making sure the sound was good and everything's fine, and I've had guys go, "Hey, you with the band? God, I'd like to fuck her." You know, you gotta bland it off. You know? See, we've been through it. She slept with somebody, so I slept with somebody, or we thought we were gonna sleep with somebody. The fights are one thing, but the sex... We hurt each other. We've done just about every lie there is. And sometimes I am amazed that somehow we're still here. And all I can think about is that I fell in love with her the moment I laid eyes on her. She's Georgia, you know? And we're gonna grow old together. I stripped the beds. You didn't need to do that. Yeah, well, sure, I did. It's pouring, Sadie. And you hang them out. How dumb to forget. Well, no harm done. I borrowed this, okay? Whatever. It's fine. You don't need to clean the house, Sadie. I was cleaning motel rooms. Really. No, really. Oh, God. Sadie reduced to that. Or is there anything Sadie can't be reduced to? You want to give me a break, Sadie? You want to give me one? I can feel what you're feeling. No. No, you can't. You can't feel what I'm feeling. You aren't me. I think we should not get into this. Fine. Better for me. Shit. Dad's coming to stay a week, Friday. I'll be here. Gets really tense, Sadie. I'll be here, okay? How's he doing? Fine. I think fine. I think all right. You need some money? Yeah. Yeah. Something to get started on. I'm good for it. I don't want you to be good for it. It pleases me to be able to give it to you. I love being able to give it to you. Okay. Things are gonna break for me. There is not a doubt in my mind. This has all gotta be about something. This whole... adventure. Everything is stored for later use. There must be a pony. ♫ There she goes again ♫ ♫ There she goes ♫ ♫ She's knocked out ♫ ♫ On her feet again ♫ ♫ There she goes ♫ ♫ She's down on her knees ♫ ♫ My friend ♫ ♫ There she goes ♫ ♫ She'll never ask you ♫ ♫ Please again ♫ ♫ There she goes ♫ ♫ Now take a look ♫ ♫ There's no tears in her eyes ♫ ♫ Like a bird, you know ♫ ♫ She will fly, fly, fly away ♫ ♫ Fly, fly ♫ ♫ Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly ♫ ♫ Just see her walkin' ♫ ♫ Down the street ♫ ♫ Fly, fly, fly, fly ♫ ♫ Look at all your friends ♫ ♫ She's gonna meet ♫ ♫ Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly ♫ ♫ She's gonna go downtown ♫ ♫ Fly, fly ♫ ♫ Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly ♫ ♫ Gonna go downtown ♫ ♫ Go downtown ♫ ♫ Gonna shoot it up, baby ♫ ♫ Shoot it up, baby ♫ Thank you.

You want to sit in? Yeah. How was San Francisco? Had a few gigs. Got myself a manager. Yeah? You had a gig with Trucker. Yeah. Unreal. Want to welcome a good friend.

What'd you do with it? I flushed it. Well, I wish you'd have asked. You know where you are, Herman? We're in a fucking bowling alley. You got a way home? Yeah. Leland. Delivery. Yeah! Thanks. Uh, Mr. Bruno had me stop at the liquor store on the way. Mr. Bruno's a great man. How much do I owe you? Um, groceries are $4.53, and the liquor is... $36.60. Come in. Gotta take those down. Never get a chance to pick up, you know? Days just... Pfft. ...get away from me. That's $41.13. Are you all right? What? Yeah, I'm okay. I mean, I'm not a maniac or anything. And there's a little something for you. Hey, you know, I don't... I don't feel right about that. Well, it's not a lot, and I'd like you to have it. I know who you are. Yeah? Well, I try to catch you. Well, I'm glad you're out there. No, I do, whenever you... I think you're great. "Only Blue"? "Almost Blue." Yeah. That's a great song. Well, that's Mr. Costello. I don't know. Everything you do... Guess I'm making a perfect ass of myself. Yeah, I guess so. What would you think if I sort of hung out? You know, like, hung out with you. Made myself useful. I could do that. I don't know what you're talking about. Wouldn't have to be... You know, I mean, that's not why. Then why? I didn't mean to offend you. I have the highest respect for you. I have been brought up to have the highest respect for women. Very much so. How old are you? Twenty-three. What's your name? Axel. Well, I'm gonna have a drink, Axel. Would you like one? Don't drink.

It's all right, Bobby. Why'd you leave me, Bobby? She's not gonna get sick in the Rabbit, is she? It's the fucking Nyquil, man. Don't get pissed at me. Don't get sick in the Rabbit, okay, Sadie? She just slid down the wall, you know? Passed out. Nothing major. To your right. I'm with her. You know I love you, Bobby. 'Cause you taught me to listen to the bottom. Bass and drums, man. Shut up, Sadie. Don't play it. Don't lie it. If you're gonna do it, be it. Try it. Don't you wish you'd said it, Sadie? Don't cut me loose, Bobby. I'll disappear. Do yourself a favor. What kind of a thing is that to say? You used to be able to get my clothes off. Shut up, Sadie. Shit. You know what, Sadie? Got the flu, Bobby. - It's true, man. - She's burnin' up. And I-I told her, you know, she shouldn't mess around, but, you know, she had the gig and everything. So I think it's okay to deliver groceries. You know. I've done a lot of things. I've done a lot worse. But I have my whole life ahead of me. My love is cars. I fix vintage cars. I think there's where my future is. Very much so. You'll take me seriously? Yeah. I do, Axel. I'm young, but I know what love is. I miss love. I miss it. I had a really great lady. She gave up everything for me. She followed me to Chicago. We lived there together two years, 24 hours a day. Then one day, she said, "That's it. We aren't anymore." She went back to Minnesota. I never heard from her again. I'm sorry, Axel. See, I know if it's really love that... ...you try to work it out if it's going wrong. So maybe it wasn't love. I had these goals about getting to know myself better so I'm not so dependent on love. There's a lot of unkindness in the world. You know your... Your life, your day? They could be the most important part. One day could be the most important thing in your life. You'd never know it. I think, you know, you're good for me. I walk into a club, and there's this beautiful girl smiling at me, singing to me. And these shining eyes at me. She makes me real. She gives me reality, so... I'm in love. ♫ I'll tell the Arizona moon ♫ ♫ I'll tell the Arizona ♫ ♫ Moon ♫ Thank you very much. Well, I'm glad you made it. I had to see you. This is Axel. Hey, Axel. Hi. That was great. Yeah, the band was hot tonight. I want you to give my best to Bobby. You guys are working. Doing good, yeah. Hey, you know who came by the backstage? Georgia. Really? When? It was Wednesday. We were working Wednesday and Thursday. Yeah, it was Wednesday. Did I just screw around with a can of worms here? No. 'Cause if it's open, you know, I'll step in it. You know, we opened for Georgia. I heard. Yeah. In Austin, and Eugene, and Winnipeg, and... So she came by, and they were just coming off the ceiling. You know, I don't think she'd feel too good stepping in your light. Fuck you very much, Jo. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were in here. No, come in, Mish. It's all right. I was just... I don't know what I was just. Everybody's looking for you. Thank you for finding me. You are so like your mother. Two peas in a pod. And your grandfather. Three peas in a pod. I'm like my dad, I think. The table looks great, Mish. You know what's so good about us, Georgia? We're so close. Growing up, I can't remember not doing everything together. Are you okay? I'm fine. What are you doing with Axel, Sadie? How do you and Dad find so much to talk about? We don't. We don't talk much. I'm going to marry him. His grandmother's ring. And there's only one Jake. How old is he, Sadie? He loves me. I'm gonna stay out of this. So what is it that happens between you when you don't talk? Leave Dad alone. I do. I do. That's what I do. Will you come to the wedding? Sure. Okay. I'm going to do it. Fine. You know, I watch you, and I listen to you. This gift from God. And I swell up with admiration and pride and love. And I swear on Mish and Andrew there is no envy. You know, I can't. And here I am, not three feet away from you, and I talk to you, and I swear, Georgia, it feels like no one's home. You disappear on me. You know what I truly want for you, Sadie? I want you to be happy. You want to be trouble-free, Georgia. Okay. All right. How you coming with the table, Mish? Finished. Why don't you see if anyone needs anything? Things are going good for me. I'm glad. You know his last name? Axel? Yeah. Of course. Yeah? Yeah. What do you think? You writing? Every day. Working on an album? Yes. I should do some backup. If you want. Good idea. You haven't come to hear me. Why is that? I will if you want. It would be great if you did. Well, I will then. Okay, great. I'm interesting, you know? You were the one with ambition, Sadie. I never gave a damn. You say. You know it's the truth. Funny how things work out. Not what I meant. You know, I let you talk to me this way, and I manage to make myself think it's okay. And I'm always glad you've been here. And I can't stand it when you're hurting. And I've made peace with... That nothing's enough for you. I don't want to know what you do, locked away in that bathroom for half an hour. I don't want my kids to know. I wouldn't do that in your house, Georgia. Okay. This is a wonderful home. It's very warm. You must be very happy here. Sadie and Georgia grew up in this house. Georgia bought it when it came on the market. How you doing, Dad? I'm doing all right. It's good to see you. You ought to get out more, Dad. Well, I get out almost more than I like anymore. How you doing, Sadie? I couldn't be better. This is your young man? Yes. Good for you. Axel delivers groceries. I specialize in vintage cars. So you've given us to understand. Is that your, uh, vehicle out there? That's my treasure. Very much so. Well, I wish you both every happiness, Axel. You're a peach, Dad. I meant to do that. It doesn't matter. What do you say we get married, Axel? Yeah. See, I thought that's what we were doing. I've been with a lot of men, Axel. Is there anyone I'm supposed to be approved by? Heh. "Approved by"? To meet. Family. I don't think so. I mean, it's not like you have to meet 'em right away. Axel Goldman, right? Yeah. See? I know it. Hello. My name is Sadie Flood. That's all, my fan. I got married today. Thank you. My husband, Axel. Thank you, Axel. So everybody buy another pitcher of beer because we need the gig. My sister's here tonight, everybody. And we're gonna do one of her songs! You want to come up and do it with us, Georgia? Georgia! Georgia! My sister!

And don't get up. - Congratulations. - See you. That was a nice thing you did. Didn't know I had a choice. I thought it was pretty terrific. And there's a reporter there. I mean, what's that all about? What's running through her head? It was a good thing you did, Georgia. I feel bad for Axel. "I don't write. I make them up." She didn't even say it. It's not even hers. I mean, it belongs to someone else. What's the matter with you? Nothing. I'm tired, that's all. She swallows people up. How do you not see it? I think she's an original, and brave, and without malice. Fine. She shouldn't sing. What the hell's the matter with you? Yet another casualty. Another casualty! - Pays the rent. - Pays the rent. Pays the rent. Are you fucked up? Hell, no. Hell, no. - Hi. - Hi. Hello. You want to bring your gear around back? Someone will meet you back there. Hello. My name is Sadie. Hi. Okay. Thanks. Don't fuck around. We gotta cut you loose. Yeah, uh, that's what you said. That's what you said. You're fucked up all the time, Herman. I had Thursday down for the gig, and I don't know how I got Thursday... It's not Thursday anymore, Herman. Thursday came and went. This stuff is making you stupid. Yeah. You think so? So y-you all decided this together? Yeah. Not me. Leland, Paul, and Clay, we're trying to be in a business here. We're not 23 anymore. We at least got to show up. I mean, our drummer's got to show up, Herman. I don't have a clue how I missed it, Bobby. It's not the first time, H. And it's not the 10th time. So... Okay. Yeah. Don't be a stranger, okay? I love you guys. All right, see you around, then. Take it easy, Herman. Well, that sucked pretty good. You guys would tell me if you were looking for a new backup singer. Come on, Sadie. You wouldn't. You fuckers. You wouldn't, would you? Come on, Sadie. Give it up. What's your fucking problem? Why do we have to turn this into your loss, huh? Goddamn it. Don't answer me. Don't say anything. I want to run through the set. Nice. Neat. So you know, so what Bobby had to do, you know, I understand. I'd have done the same thing. The same thing, yeah. This stuff'll kill you a lot quicker than smack. You can go a lot of years doing smack, barring accident. Chetty was... 58. Art was 60, or something. Lady Day made it into her 40s. It's not gonna be a lot of therapy. I know it's a real hard kick. Alcohol's bad shit, man. It's a real bring-down. Those guys did everything though. Did you ever try morning glory seeds? What are you gonna do, H? Didn't you think Bobby was gonna go the distance? I thought he was gonna go the whole nine yards. Bobby's a poet. He's an artist. When you see desperation in the eyes, it's a bad sign. It gets about paying the rent. What are you gonna do, H? I could always get a gig. Don't you think so? I've been looking to get out of Seattle. But I'm afraid to leave my connection, man. Every time I go out of town, it's a disaster. In Chicago, I went downtown to see where to score, and I see these three big huge black guys with guns in their pants. And I knew that all was gonna happen was I was gonna get robbed. Moved to New Orleans, tried to do it there. Got robbed. I knew I was gonna get robbed, and I got robbed. And I... You know... I used the detox to get off the street. My sister's always good for a few bucks. She's not gonna put me up forever. I don't want to be on the street, man. It's not my bag. I thought, you know, I could teach. Yeah? So you and Axel doing okay? You making out? He has a car to work on every so often. He's in paradise. And his mom sends him a little something, regular. He's a neat guy, Axel. Yeah. Yeah. Axel's a prince. Axel's a saint. ♫ Lots of time ♫ ♫ Just to dream there ♫ ♫ Golden sun in the valley ♫ ♫ Take me to Aruanda ♫ ♫ Easy life ♫ ♫ Waiting your welcome ♫ ♫ Take me there ♫ ♫ Leave my sadness behind me ♫ ♫ Let sweet paradise find me ♫ ♫ Heaven waits over yonder ♫ Everybody now. Axel. I told them to bring you in the studio. Yeah, I-I know. I don't like to disturb. It's not my nature. How you doing, Jake? All right. Hey, you. Hello, Axel. Hey, you, Axel! What's up, Axel? Everything's great. Oh. Georgia, you think I could have a minute? Could I have a few minutes with Georgia, Jake? No offense. No offense, Axel. I mean, if you're taking a break, you know. I know. You want to take a walk? Sure. So you think spring will get here? I think you can count on it. I think it's been delayed. Mechanical difficulties. So, you guys don't call a lot. You come into town. You know, like, you don't always call. Well, there's not always time, you know. You're not always home, and we have to get back, and... Well, I understand. Very much so. She sort of knows when you're in town, that's all. It comes up. She doesn't call me, either, Axel. And when's the last time you came out to the house? She's not with Bobby anymore. It was like a self-fulfilling prophecy. You know, they had this history and everything. It kept getting in the way. Sadie gets in the way, Axel. So she's been sitting in around town, and she jams when she can. You could help her. Like how, Axel? You could do something for her. Like what, Axel? Honestly. It's just breaking my heart, that's all. She's full of hope. She's full of hope. You know what she's like. Sometimes it gets too harsh, you know? You know, no offense. You're her sister. You know, when you offer her money, she takes the money, and God knows we could use it, but she takes it really not to offend you. I think you don't know that. Maybe you do know that. Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. I hate this, don't you? It's freezing. Want to get some coffee or something? Steven Soles. And Ken Stringfellow. All right, Georgia! Georgia! You want to shoot some pool? You got hours, whole hours. I gotcha. It's gonna be all right. One, two, three. ♫ I got a field ♫ ♫ Of unrighteousness ♫ ♫ Sow a seed ♫ ♫ Of scorn and bitterness ♫ Nice shot. Your lady's got a touch, Axel. Yeah. Oh, my God! We should start back. It's gonna be great. It's gonna be sensational. Who did this? Did you do this? Georgia did this. Why don't you not have that? This is to you. For always being Jake. The only thing I ever envied my sister. This is to you and tonight. And tonight. Yeah. Georgia's pregnant. Oh? God! Well, that's so great! It's pretty great. It's a knockout. It's a very special privilege for me to bring Sadie Flood out here tonight. Seattle's home. We're gonna kick the shit out of this thing. Put it to bed, baby. It's incredible for me to be here, on this stage with my sister. The single person I'll miss when I leave this earth. Yeah. How sweet this is. The only thing that has any meaning is what's real, right? What we get, what we give each other. And in the dark, we're all scared. We're all scared. And there's more of us out there all the time, man.

God bless. You were real good. Keep drinkin'. Round the edges. I love you. I love you, Georgia! Want me to drive? No, I don't want you to drive. I take it that you're angry with me. You took her to a bar, got her juiced up, got you juiced up. Why would that bother me? She was wound up tight. She was gonna come boppin' off the walls. Well, you fixed that. Did you seriously think that she had no other access to a bottle or whatever else she wanted before she got there? I don't need to be right, Georgia. I don't think I could ever grasp... I mean, not a clue. ...What it's like to be your sister. Ever so sorry about that. Very much so. Thank you, Jake. I whipped your ass at pool. Yup. I whipped his ass. Where are we going? To the house. Ah. Right. Family weekend. So was I great, or was I great? I wish I'd been there. Heh-heh. You were there. Or was I just okay? You could hear a pin drop. You were great. I thought that you were something. Ha! What did sissy think? Ooh. Stern silence. Georgia was embarrassed of me. For me. Which? Georgia needed to help me out up there. Didn't you, Georgia? See, I thought I was doing fine, but my sister couldn't leave it alone. For fear of what? For fear of fucking what, Georgia? Did I need saving, Georgia? How good did it feel to be able to pull me out? It felt like a thousand pounds of dead weight, Sadie. Is that what you want to hear? I don't want this anymore, Sadie. I want you to let go of me. Let go of me! Please! Please, Sadie! Do whatever you have to do, but I don't want to be a part of it anymore. I can't do it. I don't want to do it. Georgia. Right. Sadie! Sade. Good, Sadie. - You want to get out? - Georgia. Do you want to get out, Sadie? Georgia! What do you want to do? This is entirely up to you, Sadie. This rig's not big enough for the both of us. You're welcome to spend the night, you and Axel. What do you want to do, Sadie? We're in the middle of nowhere. How long were you prepared to sit here? ♫ But he sure ♫ ♫ Found out the hard way ♫ ♫ That dreams ♫ ♫ Don't always come true ♫ ♫ Oh, no, uh-uh ♫ ♫ Oh, no ♫ ♫ So he pawned all his hopes ♫ ♫ Whoo-hoo, hoo-hoo ♫ ♫ And even sold his old car ♫ ♫ Whoo-hoo, hoo-hoo ♫ ♫ Bought a one-way ticket back ♫ ♫ To the life he once knew ♫ ♫ Oh, yes, he did ♫ ♫ He said he would ♫ ♫ Oh, he's leavin' ♫ ♫ Leavin' ♫ ♫ On that midnight train ♫ ♫ To Georgia ♫ ♫ Leavin' on ♫ ♫ The midnight train ♫ ♫ I'd rather live in his world ♫ ♫ Than be without him in mine ♫ ♫ Come on ♫ ♫ And I'm on ♫ ♫ The midnight train ♫ ♫ To ride ♫ Thanks, guys. Night. Night, Sadie. Night, Sadie. Good night. Well. Can I fix you something? No, sweetie. It's no trouble. No, baby. Are you scared of me, Axel? No. Gotta go home for a while. Chicago? Yeah. For a while. I'll come with you. Well, you know, maybe you could come later, you know? You taking a hike, Axel? No. 'Cause it's all right. I don't think my mom's okay. I'm sorry. I'll be back. Hard to know how long, right? I can send for you. This must have taken you days, Axel. I can. I can send for you. I'm 23, Sadie. Try cutting me some slack. How about a blowjob instead? Fuck you, Sadie. Didn't mean it. I swear. I do everything I know how for you. I know, Axel. You gonna be all right? Yes. I'm not leaving you. No. No such luck, all right? Send for me, Axel. I got back. Did you meet Brian? Yes. Do you know Georgia Flood, Brian? This is her sister. Oh. Uh, well, it's good to meet you. I'm a big fan. - She sang with Trucker too. - Didn't you? How's the world treating you, Sade? Well, we're trying to come to terms. You and the world? That would be a shame. I'm a married woman. What, you? Yes, me. Yes, me. Well, congratulations. So how you doing? The same. Things are about to break. I'm not a homosexual, Brian. Did she tell you I was a homosexual? No. Sadie's little joke. - Did you get another cat? - No. Yeah. Well, I tried a dog. You can rely on a dog, but I couldn't train him. Messed all over the apartment. Shit and pissed. So damn dependent, dogs. I need a gig, place to stay. Let me look into it, okay? Yeah, well, a place to stay. Yeah, I'll look into it. What kind of answer is that? You're my manager, right? Whatever the hell that means. Where were you for me to manage? I don't remember seeing 10 percent for the months at a time you were gone. It's not the money, Sadie. I always thought you had the goods. I appreciate talent. I put myself on the line. You want work and time to pay off. I'm not above getting hurt. So if I'm not in total rapture at seeing you, you'll understand. You are so full of shit, Chasman. The other day, man, I couldn't find the door. Shit. I swear. I couldn't find the goddamn door. No fucking shit. You know where's the door to this apartment, like the back of my hand. And I can't find the door. Did you lose Brian? Brian found the door. Guess so. Well, I'm game. Fuck it. We'll check ourselves in. Detox. We'll go to L.A. You've got to make it in L.A. to mean anything. Yeah. We'll clean up. Yeah. Don't touch my wake-up. Want to find it right there in the morning. Do you have a prepaid ticket here for Sadie Flood? For Seattle. The 11:30? I'm not showing anything. Flight 484? I don't know. I'm in Medford, right? The 11:30. I'm not showing anything. Yeah, well, maybe you could call. As soon as it was prepaid, they'd have put it in the computer. It would show up on the computer. I'm sick, see? There was supposed to be a wheelchair. So, uh, maybe you could call someone. Why don't you have a seat? I'll see what I can do. Yeah, well... There's another flight at 2:35. I'm not on this plane, I'm out of here! It's a medical emergency! I'm sick, and... How long ago was the ticket purchased? I don't know. Hour, half-hour. Look, do you have a supervisor? I got to be on the plane. I'm sick, see? What's your name? Why don't you sit down and let me see what I can do? I really need to take care of the rest of these people. Okay... Helen. Who do you have to fuck to get some help around here? Rollinger, Munson, Okeson and Rice, ...to the boarding doorway gate C-2 for departure. You can't get on the plane without shoes, miss. Do you have shoes? Are you kidding me? It's an airline regulation, miss. It's a medical emergency. I have to get to a hospital. I'm sorry, ma'am. You're not gonna let me board? We can't let anybody board without shoes, ma'am. Shit! Fucking horseshit, man! Anybody got a pair of shoes? This is a medical emergency! Anybody got a pair of shoes so I can get on a goddamn plane? Please? Anybody want to give me a pair of shoes to get on this fucking plane, please?! Thank you. The arrival of Flight 484 at 12:37 from Medford, Oregon. All those arriving passengers can be met momentarily at gate marked E-4. Hi. I'm sorry. Your flight was early. Twenty minutes, yeah. I thought Jake would come. No. I wanted to come get you. So how'd you find me in here? I left my bag outside. I'm really sick, Georgia. Let's get your stuff. Look at you. You told 'em not to let me die, right? Yeah. You know what I mean? Yes. Thank you. I didn't know who else to call. I'm so sorry, Georgia. They weren't gonna let me on the plane. This kid was great. Well, I'm thin, huh? You're not gonna be able to find a vein. Why don't you let me do that? I think I've got this under control. She's gonna be okay. We're gonna be giving her high doses of Valium so she doesn't seize. And, uh, he'll give her clonidine patches for the heroin. You go home and rest. She'll pretty much sleep the next couple of days. This is probably inappropriate, but... I'm a really big fan. What are you doing here, Dad? I don't want you here, Dad. Really not. This is my party. Where's my sweetheart? Who? This guy I was sleeping with. He left me. She awake? She wants a cigarette. I'm sorry about the robe. I really love this robe. I don't care about the robe. It's yours. Make sure she's sitting up while she's smoking. Don't nod out on us, Sadie. We're very proud of this girl. She's come a really long way. She's the best nurse on the ward. You are, huh? They hate me here. They do. So this must be a real embarrassment to you. No. Why? I cry all the time. The patches make me a little... You know. Well, you see. How's it going? Lots of paperwork. It's all paperwork. And meetings. Meetings. I'm having some trouble with the "God as I understand him" part. What was Dad doing here? Dad? Really. I don't think so. Right there in that chair. I like my counselor. David. Donald. Which? David. Donald. David Donald. I think that's his name. Do you want me to call Axel? Oh, God. Axel. Sweet Axel. Axel needs to get a life. So when do you think you're gonna have this baby? I don't know. Can I? It's so amazing. Did I tell you about Stewart? The one who designed speakers. For concerts. Who's in love with you. Yeah. You mean Sam. Sam? Heh-heh. Yeah. Did I tell you about Sam? Ow. You look good. You too. They had to see if I was approved. Yeah. I make a list. Like I'm in control here. So how is it? It's great, yeah. Real people. So how you doing? You know. Survival. And Bobby? Seattle's own, huh? Say hello. Sure. I did it myself. It was driving me crazy. They let you have scissors? Yeah. Scissors. So you think I look okay? You look great. I miss you guys. Yeah, me too. I miss Herman. Yeah, me too. I could've called that. What? Ah, shit. I'm sorry. A month, month and a half ago. Fuckin' Herman. ♫ Lookin' for soul food ♫ ♫ And a place to eat ♫ ♫ Went to the Apollo ♫ ♫ Should have seen him ♫ ♫ Go, go, go ♫ ♫ They said ♫ ♫ Hey, sugar ♫ ♫ Take a walk on ♫ ♫ The wild side ♫ ♫ I said ♫ ♫ Hey, babe ♫ ♫ Take a walk ♫ ♫ On the wild side ♫ ♫ All right, ha ♫ ♫ And the colored girls go ♫ ♫ Do, do-do, do-do ♫ ♫ Do-do-do-do, do ♫ ♫ Do-do, do-do, do-do-do ♫ ♫ Do, do-do, do-do ♫ ♫ Do-do-do-do, do ♫ ♫ Do-do, do-do, do-do-do ♫ ♫ Do, do-do, do-do ♫ ♫ Do-do-do-do do ♫ ♫ Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-o-o ♫ Good job, Druid. ♫ And I can't afford to go ♫ ♫ To Mardi Gras this year ♫ ♫ I don't even care ♫ ♫ About payin' my phone bill ♫ ♫ Know what I mean? ♫ ♫ And private property ♫ ♫ Is really an outmoded concept ♫ ♫ Because ♫ My mind gets up five minutes before I do.

I hold a very special place for you, Sadie. Do you, Jake? Yeah. A sacred place. Well... You've only ever been the only man in the world for me, Jake. Yes. Yes? You sure? Yes. Mm-hmm. I don't want to take it unless it was going to Goodwill, anyway. Ha-ha! You're in my closet, Sadie. You can have anything you like, really. Yours. Don't do that. Don't do what? Take what you need. What are you doing? Nothing. My favorite thing. Mish has got the ticket. She can become weightless. Thin air. It's something I'm apt to encourage. Are you gonna need money? Not a lot. It's not a bottomless pit, Sadie. Well, sis... I know that, sis. I'm keeping accounts. You didn't know that. You're so funny, Sadie. You haven't asked my plans. No, I haven't. Do you care? I knew you'd tell me. Uncertain. I think L.A. I think in stages. Oh, good. Good what? I don't know, Sadie. As long as you're okay. I was just thinking, you know? You never left home, Georgia. I guess so. I must scare the shit out of you. I must be your worst nightmare. Sadie's out there, gobbling it up. Always. That's always how I see you. Gobbling it up again. I hate the desperation. Everything's so desperate. Yeah. Well, you don't do anything desperate. You don't feel anything desperately. It's not in your nature. Feeling isn't your strong suit, Georgia. No, not like you. Nothing consuming. No. Not passion. Passion? Okay, passion. Or pain. No. Or suffering. That's a gift you mistake for voice, Sadie. My God. It's how you define yourself. It's yours, I'll give you that. And Sadie's pain has to be fed, goddamn it. Kept alive. And we're all here, ready to serve. You don't sing, Sadie. You can't sing. You wish. My name's Sadie Flood.
