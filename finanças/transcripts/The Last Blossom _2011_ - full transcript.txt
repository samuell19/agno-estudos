I'll stop, then. Porridge again? You told me to make porridge for you. - You harpy! - Be nice! - Did you see my scarf? - I put fresh mussels in there. You've wanted porridge for days. Wait, Yeon-su. I made a health shake for you. I don't want any. Bye, Grandma. Don't eat it, then. No one eats in this house! What do I have to do? Do you have any surgeries today? You don't? I'm meeting the girls in the afternoon. I'll drop by the hospital when you get off work. What for? I'm leaving. My bladder isn't better and my period is gone. It's normal for your age. - I'll stop by and see Dr. YOON. - Go to a different hospital. - But I like Dr. YOON better. - We'll be late, Dad! Get some pills and don't make a fuss about it But it's not getting better. I'm stopping by, okay? Where are you? Feed me, you hussy! Let go, old woman! My head! Treating your mother-in-law like a dog! Stop starving me! That hurts! Did you pick? Good job. Now th red ball. Red ball! That's the yellow ball. - Red ball! - Yellow ball. Crazy bitch. You said this was red. No, I didn't. - I don't want to play! - Why not? Play later, after piggyback. - I don't want to. - Piggyback! No. I'm not young either. My back hurts. When you empty your heart Of all the hate When you give your love Till there's nothing left A million, million, million Flowers will bloom Someone's here? There's no one here. Take me with you! Let go of me! There's Grandpa again. You have to go with me! We'll take the ship to South Korea! Lady! You have to go with me! I told you not to smoke. What's with you? You get cravings when you're pregnant. Who says? My mom. When she saw me eat. I told you, you're wrong. Then who's it? I'm just saying that we only did it for a minute. That day at the spa. After all those beers. I didn't want to, but you came from behind! Hey, I'd never forget to do it on the outside. It could've leaked while pulling out. It's still impossible... Isn't it? No! Are you an idiot? You don't even know if you came? You're not even trying to help! I'll take care of it myself. Yes, that looks great. Can we get the mannequins? Yeon-s. I tried calling you... I must've left it inside. Sorry, sir. I couldn't get a hold of you. Could I have a word with you? - Are you busy right now? - Can't you see I'm busy? Where's the wedding hall? - On the seventh floor. - Seventh floor? Sorry I'm late. - You took the bus again. - The old woman must've stalled her. - She gets nervous without me. - Stop worrying about her. Send her to a nursing home. They're like hotels now. She's building a hotel of her own. Here's your share. It was worth the wait. The bride looks so happy. Doesn't know how sad her mother is. Life will teach these kids soon enough. Say... - Is Yeon-su single? - She's seeing someone. - They work together. - Send her while you can. Isn't she too young? That's your punishment. You waited for me? It's the same excuse, right? "The wife got suspicious, so I couldn't call for a month." Fuck. You were waiting, weren't you? It hurts. Ms. JUNG Yeon-su. Your phone wasn't answering. Where are you? Please respond. She should be nearby. I apologize, sir. - Yeon-su! - Mom! Thank you. Let's have lunch with your boyfriend. Why didn't you call ahead? I need an appointment to see my daughter? He's busy. - But he still has to eat. - He's out. - Go home. I'm busy. - Come on. Five minutes! Just a quick bowl of noodles, then. Shop around and go home. When are you going to bring him by? Later on! Sheesh. You don't? You don't have any? SHlN Sun-ae! You really don't? - You're hiding it from me! - I don't have it! Yesterday! The money you made yesterday! That's how it's gonna be? You think your old man's some kind of a joke? I'm gonna kill you. Come on! Where is it? You don't have it? You don't have any, bitch? Damn it! I said, no! After all that money your sister gave you... Goddamn it! That was just pocket change! - You borrowed five grand last time! - Bullshit! Hand it over now! - Let go of me! - This is the real deal. What's the real deal? Damn it. You've never won a game in your life! I've never seen these before. - It's a Japanese anemone. - I see. Wildflowers are hard to grow. Goddamn it. Give me the money. - Give me the money! - I don't have any! Sun-ae! - I had a full house! - Stop it! You know what that is? It'll get you a diamond on your finger! I don't care! Come back here. - Let go! - What's going on? Let go of me! Hand it over! - Let go! - Hand it over. - Give it back! - Let go! You can't do this! What do we have here? - Just look at that - Don't! Don't do this. That's our seed money! I'll pay you back. I'll win you ten times more money. Come back, you thief! Sun-ae? Give me back my money, you bastard! Where did you go? I'll kill you! Just count on your old man. You just wait. You liked that, eh? Just wait. I'll be back. Start praying for a full house! You better win some! Or I'll skin you alive! Let's have a look. There's a lot of discharge. I know. It's really dry. It doesn't smell? Who would try smelling such a thing? We do. How does Yeon-su like her job? She always works late, but never complains. - Must be a good sign. - And Jeong-su? He's having a ball since exams are over. Hope he gets in this time. Does your lower belly hurt when you urinate? A little. You should stop by another department. - Why? Is something wrong? - Of course not. Just since you're already here. We'll make some money off of you. - Next patient, please. - Yes? I missed you! I even dropped a full house to come see you. - You know what a full house is? - No. - This one is "full". - That costs six dollars. - This is "house"! - Twelve dollars! Full house! You like that? Enjoying yourself? - You scared me! - Asshole! - You bastard! - What's wrong with you? Just keep gambling, instead! Stop milking every breast in town! I wouldn't have to if you had nice tits! You bastard. Did you just laugh? You're in trouble now. Big trouble. Those are saline, eh? - You like having them milked? - I do, actually. I liked it so much, my toes were tingling. - Oh, really? - Let go. Let go of me! You bitch! My breasts! Get her off of me! You're not curious how my tests went? Is that woman pretty, or am l? Are you insane? Yeah, I've completely lost it! - How else could I live with you? - Stop biting people! Don't make me bite them, then! About your job... Can't you wait a few years before retiring? Why? It'd be better if you quit after Jeong-su goes to college. We spent so much money building the house. The young hospital director still gets on your case? What is Jeong-su doing out so late these days? Do they have persimmons? How can I help you? Any good persimmons? Let's see now. We're all out. Only these two left. Yeah. Right now? What is it? Jeong-su! Hey! JUNG Jeong-su! Hey! Stop! What's with you today? - I can't do it. - Huh? The baby... I can't! Hold on. I can't go to the hospital! - It's a tiny little person. - So? - You want to have it? - Yeah. Let's at least bring it into the world. My mom can help, and your mom too. So act like a dad. They said one drink was okay! You sounded so serious. I just left my wife on the street. What was so important this late at night? At your age, it must not be relationship advice... Cheol. - Her test results came out. - So? A tumor was causing her urinary problems. It's above the uterus, pressing on her bladder. It was big enough for me to feel it. It's malignant. Where's the MRI image? Give me your key. The key to your room! It probably started higher up, which explains the late symptoms. It seems to have spread to other organs. The first snow is so beautiful. I got persimmons. Well, now. You're such a good girl today. You like your daughter-in-law now, right? I'll peel them for you. Good girl. Let's eat. Mother! I don't like flowers! Goodness. You husband-stealing harlot. You don't deserve flowers! Mother! - Go home to ln-hee. - Home? And do what? Cry with my cancer patient wife? She said she felt sick. But I just told her to get pills from a pharmacy. Her own doctor husband. Now after all this time, I should tell her she has cancer? You know how pathetic I am? My mistake killed a patient. Sent my own hospital to ruins. I was ashamed of being on payroll at this age, so I kept telling her not to come to the hospital. You hussy! Stealing my husband wasn't enough. Now you feed dog poop to your mother-in-law. You eat this shit! - Filthy hussy. - What is this? You're driving me crazy! You're crazy! You damn hussy. You think I'm stupid and feed me dog shit! My goodness. You shouldn't waste food! What's gotten into you? It's such a waste. - It's sweet. - Filthy hussy. You think it tastes good? It tastes great! Want to try it? It's sweet. Try some. Jae-young... Are you okay? Jeong-su. Let's go. Do you even like me, Jae-young? Even if I don't go to medical school? You said you felt sure this time. I just guessed the answers. - Go to art school if you want to. - You know how my dad is. - Get up and go home. - I don't want to. - Come on. - Jae-young. - Come back here! - Dog poop! Mother, stop! Give it back. Where's all this strength coming from? You're making such a mess! What do I do? Dog poop! - Dog poop! - Stop it! When will you ever stop making her miserable? You old woman! Why are you so angry at my wife? - What are you doing? - Why? What did she ever do to you? - What did she do wrong? - I'm sorry, mister! She's just a senile old woman. Why are you drinking and acting like this? I won't do it again, mister! What are you two doing out so late? You little... I'm talking to you! - Let go. - You little bastard! Dad! Just go upstairs. - What's wrong with you? - Go upstairs. Did you get accepted? You only finished exams. Now you're out all night drinking? He worked hard, studying for exams. - Just go inside. - Let go! Don't try to scold me! You even didn't know your body's rotting away! Damn it. Jeong-su! Jeong-su. Jeong-su? Why do something you'll regret? Mother was so startled. She barely fell asleep just now. Yeon-su left. Take a cab. Come to JANG's hospital later. What for? A couple more tests to do. I did them yesterday. It's just a minor bladder problem. You doctors and your countless tests... - Stop grumbling. - What about the house? I have to go and pay the construction team today. - Go next time. - I can't put it off again! Another winter here will make mother sick. - Just come. - Don't you ever listen to me? Sun-ae! Just a minute! Are you okay? In-hee. I guess you couldn't work yesterday. It's okay. He didn't take much this time. I didn't want you to see us this way. I'm so sorry. Don't apologize. My brother's the crazy bastard. Here. To help pay the bills. Don't do this every time. I'm ashamed enough as it is. It's not much. Take it. Did you have lunch? So I took her breast and... I wanted to bite off his manhood too, but I thought I'd put it to good use one day. He just stood there? Of course not. Jumped around like a headless chicken. Won't show his face there again. Bring out some food, bitch! I said, I'm hungry. What are you doing here? Look at that mess of hair... What do you care? What brings our doctor's wife to this humble abode? Checking just how miserable I am? I gave you that money so you could work. You gambled with it? - You little... - I didn't... Yeah, I gambled. So what? Five grand can't even buy a car! It wasn't enough, so I gambled! So sue me! Don't say that to your sister! You wanted nothing to do with me. You like seeing me live like this? Can you sleep at night? Yes, you bastard. - I sleep just fine. - Good for you! Go sleep in your house. Get out! Don't come back here again! Don't ever come back! Honey. - Why are you so late? - What's the rush? Let's go. Try not to look so devastated. Forget Dr. YOON's results. Do them over. I will. It's tedious, isn't it? I'd rather just get some pills. I'm just trying to give you the full treatment. - The test room is upstairs? - No need to rush. We'll run some tests you missed yesterday. Is it hard to urinate? It rather is. How bad is it? Wasting good money on so many tests. You're sick. Go some other time. I told you Mother gets sick in that old house. - Just go home. - Why are you worrying now? You weren't even there when I had the kids. Go back to work. They won't pay you if you don't work. I can just take the bus. Don't waste money. I'm not that sick. If you're that worried, try seeing Keun-deok for once. Both of my parents are gone. He's the only family left. Don't drink tonight! You better not end up like yesterday. - We can't do surgery. - Why not? - You know. - What do I know? You're the medical genius. I'm just an old quack. They'll retire me soon, after thirty years of practice. I could quit right now for all I care. I'm not a doctor now, so explain it to me. We're too late, Cheol. A doctor shouldn't say that! Don't just give up on her! Surgery won't help anything. Her lymph glands are swollen and it's spread. Digging around will only make it worse. - Do the surgery. - No. How can you say that? She's a doctor's wife, for heaven's sake. She supported me all these years. You want me to tell her she has to die? I won't. Not until I open her up and see for myself. It might not be that bad. She's not in pain yet. She's in pain. She's only holding it in. Surgery will only make her suffer. I'm a doctor too. I know this big thing is pushing down on it. Pain every time she urinates. It'll only get worse by the day. Self-awareness is like a death sentence. Even if we can't save her, we can take it out. At least take away the pain! You can see it now. Look out the window. Don't you love it? It was hard to get the right color. What do you think, ma'am? Let's go. Take a break, gentlemen! The Mrs. is here. You see that? This is fine lumber. Dried for six months more than usual. That land is government property. No buildings will be popping up. Unobstructed views for the rest of your life. Shit. I came to ask you a favor. Me? Look after my wife when she finishes surgery. She won't like having a stranger there. - What are you talking about? - Is she sick? She was fine just this afternoon. She didn't give us much. She did say it was hard urinating. Is it bladder problems? Yes. Damned bladder is the problem. - I need a word with you. - Can you help? She's checking in tomorrow. Cheol! Of course. I'll close up right now. Don't you need to tell your husband? He won't be back for a month. - Cheol! - He still gets into trouble? - That's not good. - No. He's not so bad. He even puts up with his barren wife. Come on in! Shit. Why are you here? To bite me again? What's there to bite? They're tiny. - He's not here? - No. - Are you sure? - Stop it! I have a new man now, so get the hell out. You crocodile bitch. Or I'll bite you back. Hey! My glass is empty, bitch! Who are you? Is she your friend? What the hell? I told you he's not here. Mrs. LEE? - I'm running a bit late. - I see. She slept all day and just woke up. That's a relief. I can't go a minute without worrying. Yeon-su! - Yeon-su! - Mrs. Lee! Here she comes now. Who are you? You're a thief! You stole our rice! I caught the thief! You starved me so you could steal my husband! Mrs. LEE? Mrs. LEE? Please hurry, Mr. KlM. When you empty your heart... Persimmons! Granny! What are you doing? Why are you sitting in the trash? Honey! Have some sweet persimmons. This is dog shit! Did you eat this? Where is your family? Eat this and forget about that harlot. The ship has sailed... No, don't eat that! Mother! - Lady! - Mother! - Out of the way! - Ma'am! Over here! I'm covered in dog shit now. Mother! Lady! Mother! Mother! Catch me if you can! - Bubbles, bubbles. - I'm home. None of you care at all! - I told you to come home early! - Hi, Auntie. What's with all of you? Leaving a senile woman home alone! Wouldn't move a muscle if I even died! I'm sorry, Mom. You do it, Yeon-su. Like she could even do it right? I said, do it! - I'll do it. - No, I will. Why won't you? Didn't you hear me? Just stop it. It's hard for me too. What's so hard for you? Getting some lousy paycheck? No one forced you to work. Stop it! Are you a princess? Is Mom your servant? - Is that what she is to you? - I never said that! - Don't talk back to me! - What's wrong with you? Dragging Sun-ae here since you hate my brother! - It's not that. - Now you're harassing Yeon-su! You should come home early and stop drinking! My life is hard enough as it is. Hard enough? You've got it worse than your mother? You know what she's going through? Yellow ball! - Red ball! - Mother! Are you okay, Mother? Tell me. What did they say was wrong? - Everything. - But I'm not even hurting. - It's cancer. - Cancer? What kind of cancer? Cervical cancer. Is it still early? I'm not in pain, so it must be. Do they have to remove my uterus? I will, then. Stop smoking. It's not like I need a uterus now. My friends did it too. It's better this way. I was afraid it'd be something worse. We're not having kids now, and I'm near menopause. I'm not scared at all. Life itself is much worse. Stop acting miserable and go inside. Wonder how I got sick without hurting... You're not in pain? And if I am? What could you do? You need the bathroom? No. Then? I'm sorry Mom. I didn't know. It's nothing. They just have to remove the uterus. But don't let Jeong-su find out. He'll have a fit. Tell him it's a cyst. Don't worry. It's a normal procedure at my age. Does it hurt? Doesn't hurt at all. Go to bed. It's late. Go ahead. He's waiting for you. Where are you going, lady? On a picnic. - Then take me with you. - No, you should eat. You heartless hussy. You're leaving me behind and going alone? You can't go by yourself! Lady! - Take me with you, lady! - Mother! Take me with you, you filthy... Have a safe trip! I'll be back soon. Let's take these to the new house too. But they don't even bloom. Who knows? They might change their mind once they see the view. Mrs. KIM In-hee? In-hee. In-hee. You're giving up your womanhood... - Going out of business! - Aunt, please... It's closing day today. - You're not scared, right? - We should go in. In-hee! Aunt, come on! Let's not poke around. Remove this and close up. What about here? Couldn't we get that, too? Maybe not the others, but we could remove these. We'll begin the anesthesia. Take deep and slow breaths. Scalpel. The self retractor. The Richardson. Pull it a little more. Close her up. And she just loved it! Tingling toes and all! So I jumped on her and bit her breasts! Stop making me laugh! - My stitches will rip! - Shook her head all around! Is she done with the treatment? It doesn't seem done to me... You don't feel dizzy or shaky like last night? No. Why was she like that last night? Why won't she answer me? All high and mighty. The medicine isn't working. She's not throwing up, but that means nothing. Her white cell count is too low. - Just keep treating her. - I already told them to stop. Why? Who told you to do that? She felt dizzy, so I went up. She was in shock from the medicine. It's already spread to all her organs. Shock is the worst thing in a situation like this. You know that. I don't know. I don't know it, so keep treating her! All right? I'm going to fall in love. So pretty. Lady! Why aren't you packing? - Let's hurry. - Me too. - Hurry. - I miss you. Why are you standing there? My mother can be a bitch. We can't be late. Hurry up. Wait a minute, Grandma. We have to hurry. You know how to get to the pier! - Pack up. - I'll talk to you later. - We have to go. - What's wrong with you? Take off that stupid bra! Lady... Okay. It's my fault. The ship won't leave. Don't cry. Let's hurry! Hurry and pack. Pack up. Hurry. You bastard... Your wife in all that pain... Sir! You can't urinate in public! Come here, sir! - You're drunk! - My fruit! Me? - Screw you! - Keep it down! Mister! - Is that it? - You can take him home. - Get sober! - Give me more booze! - Damn it! - Let go of me, asshole! - This is so embarrassing! - Embarrassing? Your father is embarrassing? Just stay still! Don't raise your voice at me! - Quiet! - Come on! Goddamn it. Bastard... Telling his wife with cancer to go buy some pills... You call yourself a doctor? You goddamn bastard. Goddamn bastard... You call yourself a doctor? Goddamn bastard... Mr. KlM. Mr. KlM. You only have a handful of patients. You blew them off and clocked out. And you're late. That's unacceptable. I know you've been through a lot, but... - For managerial purposes... - Mr. KlM. I'm asking you for a favor. My wife is very ill. It could be any day now... Could you wait until then, sir? A new doctor is coming this week. - He needs a room. - Then... At least let me stay in the storage room. It won't be more than two months. I'm sorry. So you won't? No, I won't. Honey. Why not? You won't pay up for slaving my wife? I won't. I'm just asking for what's rightfully earned. - Not another dime for you. - Pay up! This is just wrong. You're all rich and treating family like shit. You'll get punished. You're in pain now? - That's your punishment. - Don't say such things! Shut your trap, bitch. Punished for what, you bastard? What did I do to be punished for? You wasted family money on your husband! And how much do I get to start a business? Ten lousy grand! - That was it! - Is that really it? That's really everything? You idiot. I can't even begin to count all the trouble you caused! So what? - Don't exaggerate! - Honey! We even had a four-story building. That's more than enough money. You ran the books. Are you saying it's my fault? What an unbelievable bitch! I don't even care anymore. We're strangers now. I'll just take my wife with me. Got that? Let's go. - Come here! - No! She's sick. Don't do this. I'm finally paying her back. - You can't do this. - Pay her back for what? "l need ten grand for this. Five grand for that." You said that every time! - Shut up and follow me. - Let go! Here! What's this? Leave your wife here. Shit. I have to drag it out of you every time. That's money for her treatment! What's wrong with you? You bastard! You're going to gamble again! I'll cut off your hands this time! A worthless person shouldn't complain. Store this for a few days in your room for me. Would you? Don't tell the wife. God, it reeks. - Lady! - Holy shit! What are you doing up? Stop waiting for mom and go to sleep. I'm going to bed. That's strange. I'm missing two red pills. Are these my pills? Let me see. Those are yours. I should go get them changed. Where are you going? You said the red ones were anticancer drugs. - I had them this morning. - I saw them too. These are your pills. Just take them. I'm a doctor. Listen to me. These nurses mix up pills all the time. - I know what I'm taking. - I ordered it. You had a tough time yesterday. I told them to stop giving it to you. Are you insane? So you stopped the injections too? Yes. I have to take it, even if it's hard! What are you, a quack? Let go of me. Wait. Honey. Nurse, I need my pills. Those red anticancer drugs. One moment, ma'am. - They were canceled. - I know. My husband and Dr. JANG are old friends. They took it out because I got sick, but I still need my medicine. I shouldn't miss a dose. - Let's go. - What's wrong with you? I have no time to waste. No one told you to meddle. Are you getting old? Where's your good sense? I need to get better. Mother needs me back home. What's the problem, Mrs. KlM? Head nurse. - You know my husband. - Of course. You know those red pills? - I didn't get them. - I see. - You're not sick anymore? - Of course not. Just one moment. Finally. - These? - Yes, thank you. Vitamins. She can leave today. Thought I couldn't find you? I'll break your legs if you run away again. My goodness... You got me again... No work today, sir? Yes. Came out exactly how the Mrs. wanted. She was so thorough. We put a lot of work into it. Here's the bathroom. Spacious, eh? Don't you love it? Honey. I keep hurting for some reason. Black and blue spots all over. I didn't bump into anything. - Take some painkillers. - But it still hurts. I'll give you a shot later. It'll work faster. He's handsome. Mom! - You look good together. - Sheesh. Should I get married, Mom? Really? Where was he from? Pohang? We should meet his parents. Let's set a date. A small wedding won't cost much, right? Mom. Look at me, worrying about money from the start. Silly, isn't it? You can do the furniture at my friend's shop... I was just joking, mom. What? Don't joke about that. How is that funny? It's funny as hell. I heard sauces were sensitive, but... The soy sauces and pepper pastes! - They all rotted. - What? I scooped some, but it's all gone bad. What in the world? This never happened before. They were fine before I left. That's so strange. All the sauces have gone bad. Hey! - You clean it up. - Damn it. Crazy bitches. What's all the fuss over this damn cow dung? You got it all over you, Grandma! Is your health getting worse? They say sauces turn bad when someone gets sick. It's strange, isn't it? Honey... Honey! Honey. What's wrong with me, honey? The surgery went fine. What's happening? What's wrong with me? I'm not getting better, am l? I'm so sorry. What's wrong with me? I'm sick. All the sauces turned bad. Am I dying? I'm dying, aren't l? What's wrong with me? - I'm so sorry. - I'm dying... What's happening? - Why? - I'm so sorry. TO MY DEAR FAMILY, PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNT HOW TO CALM GRANDMA... It looks uncomfortable. What is it? I want to try the online colleges. - What for? - Just... They use something called "Excel" for applications. Can you teach me? Later. After I'm dead? - Why would you die? - I could. You won't die, Mom. - There's daddy! - Jung-yeon! Daddy! - That's for your mother. - What is it? Nothing big. Want to take a ride? You'll ruin daddy's clothes. Have a safe trip. Come with us, Daddy. I'll join you later. You can't come in here. - Wasn't that Dr. JUNG's office? - He's not... In-hee. Dr. YOON. - Yeah? - Cheol? Want to shower together? You look good in sweatpants. Give me a minute. There's juice in the fridge. AFTER COOKING FISH... OVEN DIRECTIONS HOW TO MAKE COFFEE Yeon-su, get me a towel? Where were you? You weren't hurting? I was. But so were you. I'm fine. Lady. Are you okay, Mother? Where were you? Will you feel better if we go boating? Yes, yes. Yellow ball... That's a red ball. Red ball again. - That's a yellow ball. - Crazy bitch. This is red, not yellow! Mother? Snap out of it. You're not dead yet. Mother! Hungry? Want some boiled eggs? Mother... I raised you to be smarter than that. What? I saw him. All these years, my little daughter... Why did you do that? He's getting divorced. - You wanted to marry me off. - Yeon-su. I'm not going to end it, so stop. - Yeon-su. - Just leave me alone. I'll take care of it. What do you mean? She had surgery. We didn't do surgery. We couldn't. You said it was early. Surgery would clean it out. - We tried to get the big ones. - And? - We couldn't touch a thing. - Are you kidding me? How could that be possible? How long can she live? I don't know. That's all you can say to me? Honey, it's for you. I told you two to go to bed. Let's go to sleep. My wife suddenly came back. Just for a minute. I can't right now. I'm just... I really need to see you for a minute. - Come on, honey! - Don't call when she's here. I'll call you tomorrow. You must have things to do. - I'm not taking money again. - I don't have money. It's not money. Look at it when you get home. - I want to stay with you. - I have enough people around. Stay next to my brother. No matter what he says, don't leave him. Don't cry now. Take this and go. I'm tired. I have things to do. Jeong-su. What's wrong? What's wrong, son? Mom. What dol I do, Mom? - It's okay, Jeong-su. - She's in pain. Jae-young is hurting a lot. She keeps saying she wants to break up. Is she sick? Don't get any funny ideas. Eat up. Jae-young! Are you okay? - I just... - It happens to everyone. - No, I just got it. - What? My period. I'm really sorry. What the hell? It's been three months. You should try these too. Do you know how worried I was? Buy me some pads. - The blue ones? - No, the pink. Okay. Give me ten bucks, Mom. - Is ten enough? - Yeah. It was nine dollars last time. It's a dog's life, eh? Sorry. Hey! Are you crying? What the hell are you goddamn crying for? You bitch. You know what this is? It's money! Don't you like money? This is goddamn money! Jesus! You wanted to try that test tube baby. What the hell! Let's do it! Get off of me! What's wrong with you? You've lost your mind! Yeah, I've lost it! Do you even know what this is? LIFE INSURANCE POLICY Your sister is dying soon. She secretly got life insurance made out to you. Do you get that? How could you ever understand? How could you begin to understand her? Go gamble it away, why don't you? Go spend it on whores! You bastard! You piece of garbage. What will you do now? What will you do? You kept taking and taking from her! What will you do now? - What's wrong now? - It's rotten! I just made it this morning. This doesn't look rotten to you? It's all yellow! Stop being so unreasonable! How is this rotten? It's yellow because of the soybeans! Filthy hussy. - You've lost your mind! - Yes! I'm crazy! You filthy, worthless little hussy! I can't take this! I can't take it anymore! You eat it all! Stop it, Grandma! You promised to build Cheol a hospital, but didn't. A worthless wife! - Die! - Let go of me! Let go of her! - Hussy! - Grandma! I've had it with you! Okay, Grandma! Gosh, you're strong! Just calm down! It's not a good color. Shouldn't have bought whatever they had. No, it's nice. I'll do that. Take a rest. We should move this and scrub the floors, or your mother will say it smells filthy. Mom... Mom... - Need some help? - I can do it. Yeon-su. Is this right? It's tilting to the left. Dad! Sheesh. She must be possessed. Passed out on the floor, not knowing she's sick. Just sleeping away. Mother. Mother... - I'm sorry for before. - What? I wasn't mad at you, Dad. - Just at myself. - It's okay. It's your mom who's suffering. Don't be too sad. I think it's better that she's dying now. She's been through so much. She can rest a bit sooner. That's how I see it now. I wanted to do right by her. I know. We all did. And she knows it too. Isn't that cup pretty? Yes. I bought it for your mother. Don't think of taking it when you marry. What if she doesn't like these flowers? Don't worry. She likes all flowers. Would've been nice if we had that baby. Don't even go there. Hey, mom! Why is she out? Why are you out in the cold? I almost forgot my son's face. Hello again. You brought me flowers. Go on. - Good night, ma'am. - You're not coming in? I just came to thank you for before. Let's go in. Jeong-su is still immature. You know that, right? A little bit. They smell nice. Thanks. Yeon-su! It's so cold. - You must be cold. - It's nice out tonight. Wonder if she's awake. You little hussy! Mom! You left me here all day and went by yourself! I'm going to starve to death now! Just die, already! - I'll get your medicine! - Grandma! Grandma! You're out of control! Mom, are you okay? Wait, Mister! Hurry up, Yeon-su! Are you okay, Mom? - Mister... - Mom! Jeong-su... Dad! What are you doing? - Let go, dad! - Dad! It's all my fault, Dad! Stop... Honey... In-hee! It's all my fault, Dad! Don't do that! Don't do that! - Don't do that... - Give me the hammer! In-hee! Mom! Let her go, Mom! Dad! Jeong-su! Don't do this, Mom! Mom! Mom, stop! Let go of her! What are you doing? Mom! Let go of her! Mom! Die! Die! - Just die! - Snap out of it! Mother! Mother! Let's die together! What will you do when I'm gone, Mother? Don't ruin their lives and just die with me! - Mom! - Die with me, Mother! What are you talking about? Are you sick? Why would you die, Mom? Dad, is she sick? - Come with me. - Huh? Dad! Yeon-su! Come on! Why won't anyone tell me? I'm scared of dying too. I want to live. But I must be getting punished. Sometimes I even wondered when Mother would die. With Jeong-su's accident, I prayed he could hear with the hearing aid. I swore I'd give away all my money, and help others if he got better, but I didn't. That's why I'm being punished. That's why I'm being punished. I'm being punished. Mom. Let me help you. Mom. It's just for today. Don't poop anywhere when I'm gone. You won't, right? You only did that today since I scared you? Don't do it again. Mom! Dad, at least till I get the test results, can't you help her? I'll go to college and... I'll get a part-time job. I won't drink. I'll study hard and get scholarships. Just give me one more chance. I can't let her go like this. I've been so bad. I just... I've done nothing right by her. Feels good? Nice and clean. You look all pretty and nice. You were such a strong woman. Taking care of your husband when he got a stroke... Lonely all your life... We were two of a kind. Mother. Don't make me wait too long. All that fighting has made you grow on me. I lost my mother early on. You were with me when Cheol was studying in the U.S. You said you hated me, but you saved your favorite things for me. You don't remember, do you? - Mom. - Go away! Mother. I'm sorry about earlier. You know how I feel, right? I know I shouldn't say this, but... Just bite your tongue and come join me. Don't make it hard for Cheol and the kids. I'll wait for you. Mother! You know what, Mom? - I want to go to art school. - Go ahead. Do I look okay? I couldn't sleep. You look pretty. - I got in! - You did? - Yeah. - Let me see. Wow! Now you're a freshman too. But it doesn't start till March. You should get a new mouse. I didn't know she was sick. I would've gone to you if I knew. I guess there's a formula to love. Single women with single men. Married men with their families. Fuck. I saw your wife in my mother... I'm going to be happy. I'll meet a nice guy and be a good wife. Like your wife. Like my mother. Someone I can brag about. About how my man sleeps at night. How he can't match his socks. How his shirt gets drenched when he washes up. And just how much l... - Yeon-su... - How I miss him all day. He'll be a lucky man. Even in tears, I'm this amazing. Yeon-su. Yeon-su. - I'll go with you. - Whatever. I said I'll go. I'll go alone. Hey! Seat belt. - Just go. - Put it on, damn it. Go on! Just hit me! I've gotten hit more times than a sandbag! I'm completely broken in! Go ahead and hit me! What's wrong with you? Do it right, then! - Stay still! - My stomach got caught! Mother, say "Ah". There you go. Mother. You made it from scratch? You're all grown up now. - It's funny. - Does it taste right? It's perfect. Yeon-su. Yeah? Yeon-su? What? Just feel like saying my daughter's name. Yeon-su. - You're not going inside? - I have to make money. - Why start now, huh? - Don't get me worked up. You damn idiot. Hey, take this. - Give it to her. - What is it? It's a snack for the trip. What is it? They're walnut cookies. Her favorite. I bought them yesterday, so tell her to microwave them. She could choke or something. This is nice. I'm sorry, Mom. Mommy's hands rub your belly. In-hee's little pot belly. Mother. Cheol is taking me somewhere nice. I'm too tired to go, but I think I will. This house is starting to scare me. Saying goodbye after thirty years... Be good while I'm gone. Okay. - I'm gonna go. - Okay. Take this. Go and hide away. - I'll hide, so come find me. - Okay. Hide safely away. - Open the trunk. - Okay. Have a safe trip. Here's some food, and my husband bought these walnut cookies. You've been so helpful. I didn't do anything. Take care of Grandma. I will. What the... Hi, Uncle. So you don't choke. Bye. Gosh, it's cold! To Wangshimni, please. Are you okay, mister? My poor sister... We went there a long time ago. Time flies, doesn't it? Yeon-su. - Go that way. - Where? Over by that white building. You see the health center? Yeah? I'll be working there when we move here. We're here, Mom. But this is our house. Yeon-su and I cleaned it up. Let's go inside. - Open the trunk. - Okay. My goodness. Look at me, I'll go back home as soon as I feel rested. - Are you crying? - No... Who am l, Jeong-su? Mom. Say it one more time. Mom... Jeong-su. Even if you forget it all... The sound of my laughter and even my face... Don't forget that you came from your mom. Give this to Jae-young. I might forget later. This was all I could find to give you. I'm so sorry. If she gets pregnant, don't just think of erasing the baby. All right? Okay. Wait outside. I have to talk to your sister. Yeon-su. I think... I'm starting to forget things now. Mommy loves you a lot. You know that, right? Yeah. I love you a lot too. I know. I really love you. You're me. And I'm you. Take your brother home now. I think I should rest with your dad. My good girl. - What's this? - My gift to you. It's all in bloom. - This is embarrassing. - It was Jeong-su's idea. Why draw these flowers when you're the most beautiful? - I don't know flowers well. - You don't? You didn't know? It's just that Mother loves them. She really does. I hope it'll be good. That picture always cracks me up. Who took that? - No, don't! - Come on! - There's even mushrooms. - I want to go by the river. - Won't you be cold? - No. Have Jeong-su fix it later. I got it. - It's working. - Yeah? - The sound isn't working. - It's okay. I saw it too many times when you were busy. I need to pee... Mr. JUNG! You're so charismatic! - You haven't sung in so long. - I'll sing every day now. Long ago on a star In the sky When I first came out Into this world I heard a little voice Tell me this To spread my love All through this world A flower who only Blooms with love's touch To bring back a million Lovely blooms When you empty your heart Of all the hate Lady? You're lucky. You'll live another twenty years here. Want to wash up? It's too hard for me. You'll feel better. I'll wash you. Really? My eyes sting. Keep them closed. It still stings. Almost done. Look how pretty my wife is. - I have a wish, honey. - What is it? Make me a grave. You used to say you wanted to be cremated. We cremated my mom and I didn't like it. We scattered her ashes at Han River. After a few years, I forgot where we scattered her. Cried up and down the river like a crazy person. Don't want you and the kids to do that. At least bury some under the tree in the yard. You're fine without me, right? No more nagging. I'm not fine. You think you'll miss me? Yes. When? All the time. All the time, when? When I put on my tie in the morning. And? When I'm eating bad stew. And? When I'm eating good stew. And? When I'm drinking and when I'm hungover. When I look at the bed. When I sleep and when I wake up. When I feel like getting nagged. When Mother is acting up. When Yeon-su gets married. When Jeong-su goes to college. When he graduates. When it's New Year's. When it's Thanksgiving. When I'm sick and when I'm lonely... Hurry and come to me, so I don't get bored. If you think I'm pretty, give me a kiss. I was blessed to have you. Honey. Honey. In-hee... Feed me, lady! Lady, where are you? Lady! Feed me. - Yeon-su. - Yes? - Give Grandma breakfast. - Okay. Feed me, lady! Feed me! Okay, Grandma, I'm sorry. Find a better hiding place, Jeong-su. Then why don't you do it? Doesn't that look good? What is this? I made a health shake for you. You just threw stuff in? Get the ratio right! Try it. You see? Memorize it. Mom wrote it all down. Or follow her directions. Or ask Aunt Sun-ae. She helped me last time. - Fine. - Fine. Feed me, hussy! The stew was a bit off, too. No, mother. Don't. Help her, Jeong-su! Let's eat, grandma! Get me a spoon! Where did it go? It's my three-year anniversary with Jae-young. Couldn't Yeon-su watch Grandma? - You sat on it again! - Is this it, Mother? You know he's lying, right? - Don't let him trick you. - I'm not lying. I did it last week. I don't remember. - Absolutely not. - Come on. I have to work. Jae-young comes first than your grandma? But it's our anniversary! You said that last time. Where are you going without me? - Nowhere, Mother! - Grandma, stop! - We're running late, Dad! - We'll be home early! Gosh, you're so strong! I'm not going anywhere, Mother. I'll play with you! We're here! Not you again! Again, Grandma? You'll wear him out. I hate you! I'm okay. There you go again. I can handle it. Come down! - Over there! - What now? - What's wrong, Mother? - Over there! Mother, please! "LOOK CLOSE, SEE BEAUTY LOOK CLOSER, SEE LOVE." "THUS AS YOU ARE." FOR KIM IN-HEE (1958~2011) It's cow dung!
