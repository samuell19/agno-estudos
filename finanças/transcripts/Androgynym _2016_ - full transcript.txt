(dog barking) (car door opens) (mysterious music) (knocking) (mysterious music) (grunting) - [Voiceover] Hey, hold up man! - I already paid you, man. We fucking paid you yesterday. (grunting) (mysterious music) (car engine sounds) (heavy breathing) - [Voiceover] You're so pretty. What's your name again? - Fuck you. (soft music) (car engine sounds) (moaning) (ethereal music) - Wanna smoke? - No. (ethereal music) (tense music) - Where's your brother? (tense music) - Fuck! (tense music) (struggling sounds) (buzzing) (tense music) - Did you honestly think you could hide behind that stupid mask forever you fucking... Pussy. (tense music) Times are changing, and Lou's little business is about to come to an end. Right about now, actually. (tense music) Yeah, that's fuckin' right, my brother's headed over to Lou's house right now to put a bullet in his fucking head. You're his last little bitch and now I'm gonna put a bullet in your fuckin' head. - I have a headache, where's the molly? - Fuck! (tense music) - No! Stop! (tense music) No! (gasping) (gunshot) (fast paced music) (phone ringing) (phone vibrating) - Lou, they're coming for you, I'm on my way. (door knocks) - Don't come over here, kid. You probably don't wanna go home either. - What's going on? Who is that guy? - Get out of town, kid, and don't come back, ever. (fast paced music) (gunshot) (tense music) (soft music) (shower running) (electronic music) - Can I give you girls a ride home? - No, we can walk. - I'll walk with you. - No thanks. - Well, how about this, I'll give you $500 to just come back to my hotel, and just have a drink with me. - Look asshole, just fuck off. - $1,000. - Fuck you. - What is wrong with you? - Nothing. - Ah. - Let's just get out of here. (door shutting) (gasping) (panicked breathing) (yelling) (whimpering) (alarm beeping) (classical cello music) (phone ringing) - Lathen? Lathen. Frank's Pizza Tunnel Road. (ominous music) (strained breathing) (knocking) - [Voiceover] Room service. (knocking) - Just leave it at the door, dude. - [Voiceover] Nah, man, you gotta sign for it. - No. - Sir? You know what, I'll just leave it at the door, you gotta sign for it, and bring it on your way out to the desk or whatever. (electronic drum music) (gasping) (ominous music) (knocking) (ominous music) - Did you order a pizza? - Just do it, man. - Okay, do what? - Who the fuck are you? - Shit man, I went to the wrong floor, and you're bleeding. - I was in an accident. - You want me to call somebody, get something for you? - Not unless you can get me some Oxy. - I might be able to get you some. - I'll pay you. Whatever you want. (grinding noises) - I got you 20, they were 10 apiece. - Will you hand me three? There's money on the table, just take whatever you want. - I'll just take two. - Take them all. - I have a DVD here of a movie I'm working on, if you know, you get bored later, whatever. I'll just leave it on the TV. - You made the movie? - Yeah, it's the first part of this animated movie I'm making. - Put it in. - [Voiceover] The Gliesens were a noble race, not altogether peaceful, but innovative and intelligent. They lived in relative abundance until a valuable jewel was discovered deep within the inhabitable zone of their tidally locked planet, Gliese 581e. At first, only the bravest Gliesen ventured forth for the jewel they called Leohtfaet, and they were encouraged and supported by the community. The journey was long, the terrain, desolate, the dangers, many, and success unlikely. But for Gliesens, there was no greater honor than these discoveries. (Gliesens chattering) Even though most were lost, the few that did return brought with them such a blessing as to make themselves and the people around them like gods. (soft music) (Gliesens chattering) The light given off by the Leohtfaet complimented the Gliesen biology. It gave them the ability to shift-shape their bodies at will, and life on Gliese 581e flourished at its assimilation. Towers were erected, technologies developed, and society flourished. Anything they wanted, they had but to imagine it. But then, all at once, the Leohtfaet stopped giving light. The Gliesens could not accustom themselves to their old way of being. (crashing sounds) (groaning) (crashing sounds) As they had known the way of the gods, how could they again live the lives of mortals? (Gliesens roaring) Conflict became the only Gliesen relationship. (Gliesens arguing and struggling) Those that didn't die searching for the Leohtfaet either killed each other off, then killed themselves in despair. (grunting and swords clashing) Life to life without end, and all that stands before and after, is time. (sorrowful music) Cetana was the last Gliesen standing. He wandered the habitable zone, searching for survivors. - Is anybody out there? Hello? - [Voiceover] The stories of the grandfathers told of the Gliesen genesis, awakening from caves, and into these caves, Cetana sought to return. In this cave was a gift. Illumination. Eventually, the Leohtfaet began to shine again. (suspensful violin music) In his newfound bliss, Cetana constructed a great ship. (suspenseful violin music) And left his home in search of other life, in search of companionship. - I like it. - Thanks. - Yeah, that's cool man. I wanna see more. - You wanna come check out my studio some time, I mean, you know, when you get to feeling better. - I feel fine. - That's my prize possession. James Roday gave it to me personally at the Gravy Premiere. It's kind of a long story. And there's this contest coming up for best animated short film. That's mine. And that was my dad. He worked for the news, but he died a week after that picture was taken. Anyway... (quiet piano music) - [Voiceover] Cetana traveled for 43,200 years before finding an inhabitable planet. This world, Earth, as it was called, was always changing. Its people were always changing. The same person would be now strong, now weak, now happy, now sad, now full, now empty, now calm, now mad. Trivialities turned friends into enemies, lovers into sadists. Love to despair. The Leohtfaet seemed to insult Earthean biology. Proximity was enough for an Earthling to become suddenly and irrationally either terrified or enraged. - I hate you. - I hate you. - [Voiceover] Bliss to the Earthlings was intolerable. No measure of self control could soften its effect. So Cetana kept it hidden away, in order to find his place within his new environment. quiet piano music) Although much of what the vast majority of Earthlings chose to do on an everyday basis was either foolish, violent, uninteresting or ridiculous, the story of the evolution of life on Earth piqued Cetana's interest. - I want to study lost creatures and extinct animals, how can I do this? - Go to school. - I want to go to school. - That'll be $3,000. - [Cetana] I don't have that, what can I do? - [Voiceover] Get a job. - [Voiceover] There was something more powerful than the Leohtfaet on Earth. - I need $3,000. - You're in luck. - You can start right now. - I need a start packet and a uniform. - [Voiceover] It was called money. - Holy shit, that was awesome. - It's pretty cool. - We have a spare room if you just want to crash here tonight. - Okay. - My mom doesn't come home till late, and she never comes down here anyway. (mumbles) Goodnight. I'll go see if he's up. - Hello. - Mom, this is... I never got your name. - Sit down, we're having toast and eggs. So what kind of accident were you in? - It wasn't an accident, it was... Surgery. - Oh my, for what? - Mom. - What? I'm just asking. He doesn't have to tell me if he doesn't want to. - I'm sorry, she's a little nosy. - I am not. So, John tells me you don't live here. You're... If you need a place to stay, you're welcome to sleep in our spare room for a few days. - Thank you. - Want some coffee? - Are you okay? - Just a little tired. - He is a little weird. (sizzling and pots clanging) - [Voiceover] A few Earthlings had most of the money. And the rest had to share what they had. Not having money made people ugly. And having it, or even the thought that someday one could have it made people even uglier. (sorrowful violin music) The process of attaining money was horrifying. (sorrowful violin music) Sleep was Cetana's only peace, but his dreams were singular and unvaried. - [Cetana] Why does that which gives me meaning, also isolate me completely? Why am I so different? I look like they do, I act like they do, but my essence is alien. And I am the last of my kind. - Oh my god, the bacon is burning, I have tried so hard to be patient with you, but if you can't cut it on the grill, you're gonna have to find another job. (suspenseful violin music) - [Voiceover] No more, no more. No more. (suspenseful violin music) - We need two double triples ASA... Hey, what's that in your forehead? You know what, I've had it with you, mother fucker. Fuck! Fuck, I've had it with all of this. Cindy, you're fired. No bitch, you can't have the kids meal. Ms. Robinson, coffee not hot enough? Now it never will be. All these fuckin' burgers. Fuckin'... (gunshot) - [Voiceover] They would blame him. - Get on the ground mother fucker, or I will blow your god damn brains all over this fuckin' place. What are you doing? Get your fucking hand out of your pocket. What are you doing? Mother fucker, get on the ground. Put your fucking hands up. What the fuck is that piece of shit? What in the fuck is that piece of shit? Oh my God, that's impossible, how are you doing that? Put that fucking thing on the ground, and step away from the counter with your hands on your head. I will shoot you, I will fucking kill you. (suspenseful violin music) - [Voiceover] He couldn't let them take his bliss from him, so he sent it home, in the vain hope that the Earthlings would show him mercy and understanding. - Yeah (mumbles) I'm just getting to the Burger Max right now. Oh my God, oh my God, there's blood everywhere, oh my God. (gunshots) (somber music) (sirens blaring) - [Voiceover] Long ago, there was rumor of a woman, Jivana, the great mother, the first to discover the Leohtfaet. She issued to those who stayed behind as she left Gliese 581e that her journey was a challenge to any who would brave the task, and that whosoever, man or woman, could find her in the expanses of space, she would marry. And together, they would create a new Gliese 581e. - [Cetana] I can leave any time I want. I can leave any time I want to. (water running) - Oh, hey. Hope you eat meat. Sit down. It's a little over done, but I think it'll be okay. - Thank you. - Do you have any plans for tonight? Well, I'm going to see a concert if you want to go. - Sure. - Great, I'll be home at nine, I'll drive. (knocking) - How long you gonna be, I gotta go to the bathroom. Hello, John. Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't know it was you. Are you feeling better? Would you like a cup of hot tea? - Sure. I'll be out in a second. (bicycle whirring) - [John] All right mom, I'm leaving, goodnight. - Where are you boys going? - Trout fishing. - Oh, and Nym, service starts at nine, I go every Sunday if you ever want to come. - Nym. I like that. Hey, Nym. - Hey. (guitar strumming) ♪ Falling in love ♪ It feels like a trick ♪ Oh ♪ And John Lennon said love ♪ Is all you need ♪ Oh ♪ Sometimes it feels ♪ Like a sheet ♪ Over my eyes ♪ Oh ♪ Sometimes it feels like I'm just trying ♪ To rationalize ♪ Oh ♪ What is ♪ What is really real ♪ What is really real ♪ What is really real ♪ What is really real ♪ - [Voiceover] Thank you very much. (clapping) (creepy music) (chainsaw sounds) - These will look great on you. Here you go, thanks for coming. Is that your brother? - No, he's just a friend. - Did he recently come out? - I don't know. - I work weekends at Stanley's downtown, Tuesday through Thursday night they have amateur drag. You guys should come check it out. - [Woman] Perfect, it's lovely, what do you think? - I like it. (ominous music) - [Voiceover] Hey boys. - [John] What are your specials? - Well drinks three dollars till five (mumbles) - Whoa, who's winning? - I think he is. - Are you boys from around here? - Yes. - Locals, I would not have guessed that. So you got any big plans for the day? - I might take him up on a mountain later. He's never been hiking or anything. - Well, you two are fucking adorable. (soft piano music) - You sure this is our guy? - [Voiceover] I haven't gotten close enough to be absolutely sure. Carlos, there's something else you should know. He's disguised himself as a woman. I'm 99% sure it's him. - All right. I'll be there later on tonight. Make sure he's ready for me. - I don't think I'm going to get you any more pills after this. - But I like the pills. - I used to like the pills. I got married right after college, and me and my wife moved to LA and started working in movies together. We got into a pretty bad car accident. Fucked up my shoulder, and fucked up her knees, and they gave us a bunch of pills. First, we started taking them for fun, and then we started taking them all the time, and one night, while we were high, she stopped breathing. When I came to the next morning, she was long gone. - Jesus. - So, my mom let me move back in with her, and I got clean, and I started working on my own movies again, and now, with your help, I'm almost done with my first one. I haven't had anybody to work with or do anything with in a long time. There's a really beautiful overlook, it's 20 minutes further up, come on. Maybe we should just go. (solemn music) - [Voiceover] It had been a long time since Cetana had pondered his mortality. - Liar, why did you shoot all those folks at the Burger Max? - [Voiceover] The Earthlings kept his body alive. - Time for your pills, sweetie. - [Voiceover] But assaulted his soul daily. - Probably gonna get the chair for this. - [Voiceover] His curiosity had fallen to disgust. (solemn music) People were ridiculous. It wasn't the Earthlings' fault. It was he who did not belong. Cetana hated this planet, but he felt somehow, he was there for a reason. - Is grandma gonna make it, daddy? (screaming) - [Voiceover] No, honey, she's gonna die. (solemn music) - [Voiceover] Life to life without end, and all that stands before and after is time. (solemn music) And then suddenly, as a premonition, he felt hope again. - This is getting nowhere, I am done talking with you. (yelling) - [Voiceover] This Leohtfaet was different from his. It was smoother and of a different pitch. Where had it come from? It was she, Jivana, the rumors were true. He would be her husband and a new, and better Gliese 581e awaited them. - And cut. That's it, it's finished. - Congratulations. - And I couldn't have done it without you. - Yeah you could have. - No, I couldn't have. You're my muse. (ominous music) - All right, I'm starving. (ominous music) - So where are you from? - Gliese 581e. - There's usually nobody down here but homeless guys. It's so pretty. - It is. It's cold. - So, what is this? - What do you think this is? - It's just that I really like being with you, and... - Let's go. Carlos wants to see you. - Who is Carlos? (menacing music) (gunshot) - [John] Did you know that guy? - [Nym] Yes. - Why was he trying to kill you? - Cause I've got it coming. - [John] Wait, stay here. - Nym, can you move? (grinding sounds) Nym, I think this is gonna work. (chainsaw sounds) (grinding sounds) (quiet music) Nym? Nym. Let's go home. (ominous music) Is it bad? - [Nym] It's fine. - What kind of accident were you in anyway? - I was young, I was stupid. And I didn't care about anything at all. I'm tired. I'm gonna leave tonight. I'm not good for you. I'm not good for anybody. - No, you're -- - Please, I'm not trying to get you to convince me to stay, okay, if the cops come, just tell them I forced you to do all this shit, and you were too scared to do anything about it. - I don't know what happened with you or with your accident, or with your life, but I want you to stay. I'm not worried. No one's ever gonna find that guy. It's taken care of. He had it coming. It's crazy. It's crazy that we even met at all. I was high, I went to the wrong floor. You can't leave now. - Get out. - Wait. Wait, mom, listen. - Get out, now. I knew you were trouble the first minute I laid eyes on you. - Mom. - And you, your father would be so ashamed of you. I'm embarrassed. That's it, get out right now. Your stuff will be in bags at the top of the driveway tomorrow morning. Get your things from the street, I don't want you to ever talk to my son again. Shame on you. - Then I'm leaving too, mom. - No you're not, I co-signed for that car, I put up the down payment, it's just as much my car as it is yours. Just like this house, just like everything we have, and you're throwing it all away. I have respected your right to believe what you want. You obsess over your scary movies -- - Nym! - And to listen to that unwholesome music, but if you're going to turn away from God like this, I don't know what else to do with you. - Turn away from God? (ominous music) (sobbing) (electronic bass music) - Peaches everybody, that was Peaches, put your hands together. Wowing us with her moves everyone thank you Peaches. All right, it is amateur drag night here at Stanley's, every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I want to thank you all for being out tonight.
