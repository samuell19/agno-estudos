- Morning. - Morning. - Looking for something? - Yeah. A hardcover of Their Eyes Were Watching God. Hardcover? Yeah. I think we have one. Thanks. You know, uh, I actually haven't read much Hurston. Yeah, she's great. Um, it's actually a gift for my professor. Oh, okay. You're a student. Mm-hmm. Getting my PhD. Oh. Wow. Columbia? NYU? Nice. What's your, um... What's your thesis topic? "Redefining Radicalism: The Rise of Black Feminism in American Literature." Oh, wow. That's a mouthful. - How's that going? - Slowly. Very slowly. Oh, yeah? - Irma Thomas… - Well, I'm impressed. …"Ruler of my Heart" on WNYC. Um, that'll be 15 even. - …New York public radio. - Thank you. I'm John Schaefer… …and if the soul queen of New Orleans couldn't lighten the mood, maybe Duke Ellington will. Here's his classic version of "In a Sentimental Mood," featuring John Coltrane. Um, there's actually this little Japanese restaurant on Mott Street. Uh… If you're not doing anything later, dinner's on me. Sorry. Um… No. That's... - You probably have a boyfriend. - No, I don't. I'm… …I'm single. I'm-I'm single, and I kinda like being single. Oh, yeah. No, I-I-I totally get that. Uh, your card's not going through. I must've maxed it out again. - Let me see if I have enough cash. - It's fine. It's fine. You know what? Actually just, um, take the book. No, I couldn't. - What if someone else came in looking... - They can order it online. Or whatever. I-It's fine. You can come back and pay for it later. - Thank you. I... - Yeah. - I promise I'll be back with the money. - Yeah. Thank you. - Bye. - See ya. You probably have a boyfriend. Idiot. "Probably have a boyfriend." - Hi. Remember me? - Hey. Yeah. Uh, got your money. Oh, you didn't have to do that today. I didn't wanna leave you hanging. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Uh… - Just keep the change. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Uh, well. See ya. - All right. Yeah. - Yeah. - Have a good one. - You too. - Hey. - Hello. So, remember this morning when you asked me out to dinner? - Oh, yeah. I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... - Oh! No, no, no. I... I actually wanted to say yes. I was standing there thinking how nice it would be if this guy asked me out, and right as I thought it, you did. And I... I don't know. I panicked. You panicked? I panicked. I'm Sandra. Tom. Nice to meet you, Tom. Nice to meet you. - So, Mott Street? - Yeah. If that... Yeah. - Okay. Yeah. Okay. - This way. Uh… - You... After you. Yeah. - All right. I... I have my bag. No, I do too. It's getting kind of cold. - That... - Sorry… - Backpack buddies. - Buddies. Yeah, and, like, what have I gotten myself into? You know? Like, a short story is one thing. - A novel, that's, like, 300 pages and... - I know. And sometimes more. Exactly. And, you know, here they are offering me real money, you know? I have to deliver something. - So, what'd you do? - I-I had a year-long panic attack, and I… …I wrote this book that was terrible. Come on. I'm sure it wasn't that bad. No, no, it was bad. It was... It was awful. They wouldn't publish it. Ouch. - Yeah. - Sorry. No, it's fine. I... You know, at least I got to keep the advance. Do you still write? No. Not really. You know, all-all this happened around the time that my mom died, and... I don't know, I-I... Things got dark for me, and I kinda just gave up. My parents died when I was a kid. I'm sorry to hear that. Must've been tough. Anyway, um, yeah. I started managing the bookstore. That kinda pulled me out of my depression, or whatever. And… …yeah, it takes up most of my time. Must be nice being surrounded by books all day. It's the best. After my parents passed, my brother and I hopped from one foster family to the next. One point, we were staying with this couple that had this great collection of novels. And one night, I started reading Jane Eyre, and-and here was this character that was, sort of, going through everything I was going through. And I didn't want it to end. I finished it, went back to page one and started reading it all over again. Just loved books ever since. Jane Eyre, huh? Jane Eyre. Can I show you something? Oh. Oh, my God. - Is this a first edition? - Mm-hmm. Is this real? This is real. How can I be sure? I mean, some of these professors are so obnoxious. Actually used the phrase "the vaginization of German literature." - The what? - I mean, I'm pretty sure "vaginization" isn't even a real word. Where'd you learn how to cook? I spent my junior year in Florence. Do you speak Italian? I used to speak it well, - now it's a bit rusty, unfortunately. - Hello! - Hello! - Did you like Italy? I have great memories. This is amazing! But, I had this boyfriend who was a real jerk. And what about you? Where did you learn to speak Italian? My mom was from Italy. - And I watch a lot of Fellini movies. - Oh, I love Fellini. Have you ever had your heart broken? Uh… …yeah, once or twice. I really like you. Okay. I really like you too. Okay. - Just hear me out. - No, just... No, I can't. - I need your help. - I'm not doing this. - What do you mean you're not doing this? - I can't. It's me and you. It's me and you against the world, - do you remember that? - Can you please just go? - It's me and you against the world. - Jason, I need you to stop. Please, I need you. Don't walk out on me. You are the last thing that I have - on this earth. You are the last person... - Jason! - Sandra! - Jason, please don't. Sandra! - Just go. Just go. - Please. Please open the door. Sandra, Sandra, open the door. Fuck! Fuck! Fucking bitch. Are you okay? Who was that? It's my brother. He needs money. Jason wasn't so lucky. Some of the homes he was put in were… a nightmare. It's not your fault. I know, but he's the only family I got. "All happy families are alike." And all that. No matter how many times he screws me over, I can't not help him. He's my brother. I love him. Yay. Okay, you gotta blow. Blow here. You gotta blow harder. Come on. Harder. Come on. Yes! Yes! Yes! We got it. We got it. So, how long have you known Tom? Just a few weeks. - Seems like so much longer. - Yeah, I know. It's been kind of intense. She's like a sexy librarian or something. - She's... She's literally your dream girl. - I know. She's just incredible. - Where did you go to undergrad? - Uh, Vassar. Oh, my God. So did I. You know, I thought you looked familiar. When did you graduate? Class of '14. Class of '16. Did you hang out at the Mug a lot? Uh, honestly, I spent most of my time at the library. But don't tell Tom. I'm trying to maintain the illusion I'm not a total nerd. Glad to see that you're doing okay. You were in a bad place there, so… I was just a little depressed. Uh… Okay. It got bad but, you know, it's like, who hasn't been borderline suicidal at some point in their life? It's not funny. Not supposed to joke about that stuff. - Come on. Come on. - Okay, you're right. But, um… …I'm good now. You know, like, I'm great, actually. It was pretty great. Um, yeah, we actually met in the bookstore. Hi. How come we always come back to my place? What do you mean? I wanna see where you live. It's, uh... It's kind of uncomfortable there. Well, my place isn't exactly the Four Seasons. No, it's not that. It's, um, I live with my dad and his new wife, and, uh… My dad and I don't really get along. Um… he thinks I'm a disappointment. "All happy families are alike." And all that, right? Anyways, uh, he's really sick, so… Sorry he's sick. It's okay. But you're not a disappointment. Sandra? Hey. Are you okay? You're not, um... You're not returning my texts. I'm sorry. My brother's in trouble. He owes them money, so they cracked three of his ribs, broke his cheekbone. Said if he didn't pay up, they'd come back and finish the job. How much does he owe them? Paying them back is not an option. - So, what is an option? - I give him money, and he runs. Okay. So, say he runs, and they can't find him. Who do you think they're gonna come looking for to collect? Me? No, they don't even know I exist. - Are you sure? - I'm not sure of anything. - You have to pay them off. - I told you that's not possible. - How much do they want? - $350,000. And they want it in four days, so short of robbing a bank, that's just not gonna happen. I can give you the money. - What? - It's in the bank. I can just go make a withdrawal. You wouldn't have to… …rob it. - I-I don't understand. - You live at home. - You... You work in a bookstore. - No, I own a bookstore. How do you think I manage to keep it open? All that place does is lose money. You're saying you have that money just sitting in a bank? Yeah. More. Yeah. My father has money. Why is this the first time I'm hearing about this? Why does that matter? Maybe I didn't want you to know. Well, honestly, it's kinda fucked up - that you didn't say anything. - Are you kidding me? - I'm telling you that I can help you. - I can't take your money. - Why not? - Because it's $350,000. That's why. I appreciate the offer. I really do. But let's face it, we're practically strangers. First of all, it's not my money, it's my father's money. And it's not like he earned it in some noble way. He has a hedge fund. And second of all, fuck you for saying we're strangers. You are the best thing that's ever happened to me. I'm going to pay you back, no matter how long it takes. That's okay. I wish you'd let me come with you though. I told you I don't want you anywhere near these people. - It's all there. - Got it. I'll be fine. What are you doing tonight? I'm... I was hoping to hang out with this pretty girl that I know. Well, there's this great little Japanese restaurant on Mott Street. If you're not doing anything, dinner's on me. Hey. I love you. I'm so sorry about all this. All right. Sandra? Sandra, are you okay? Sandra! Sandra! Sandra! Sandra! Shit. How's Christmas Day? It's not that bad. Hey, you Larusso? Over here. - You're pretty late, Sandy. - I'm sorry. There's no cabs. It's fucking Christmas Eve. Where's Carl? Mr. Knutson's wife is sick. I'll be taking over for him. Carl usually... Mr. Knutson usually has us meet in his office. Yeah, I thought we'd meet somewhere a little less formal given the holiday. But if you'd rather go to my office, we can do that. No, it's fine. Great. Have a seat. - So, where were you tonight? - Nowhere. Just with a friend. Girl I work with. - A girl you work with at Starbucks? - Yeah. Caroline. I can give you her number if you want. That won't be necessary. - Did you do any drugs tonight, Sandy? - No. Did you engage in any behavior that would violate your parole? Nope. No. How is that job? You doing good? Yeah. It's fine. Yeah. Starbucks is great. There's lots of opportunity there. Yeah, I love it. Yeah. The thing is, Sandy, I went to your job and they told me you haven't been there in a month. Uh, yeah. I ca... I can explain. Um… - I got into a fight with the manager… - Yeah. …'cause he's a real... He's a real fucking perv, okay? And I've been looking for another job, so... Having a job is a part of your parole agreement. - Do you understand? - Uh-huh, yeah. So, you getting fired is strike one. So, let me ask you a question. If I give you a drug test right now, how would that go? - Negative. - Negative? Are you sure? Because if I gotta go to my car and take the trouble to get a test, and it comes back positive, I'm gonna be very goddamn upset. So, tell me how would that go? - I smoked some weed the other night. - That is strike two. I can bring you in right now. Your list of priors, - you aren't going anywhere anytime soon. - I know, I know, I know. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - You're sorry? Give me one reason not to bring you in. I'll give you money. And that is attempted bribery. Strike three. Congratulations, Sandy, that's the whole fucking ball game. - So stand up and turn around now. - I... Okay. No, no. Come on. - Look, I can give you a lot of money. - What is a lot of money? Whatever you wanted. Look, I know where to get it, and you know I ain't lying to you, Miss Larusso, - because you're my parole officer and... - What are you doing? What do you mean? Nothing. What the fuck? - Are you recording me? - No! No, stop. Look... Are you trying to entrap me? - No, it ain't like that. - What the fuck are you thinking? - No, no, no. Look... - Do you think I'm an asshole? I do. I think you're an asshole. Sir, I'm a parole officer and this young lady is my parolee… - Yeah. - …and none of this is your concern. You're shaking her down. I've watched you do it to parolees all night. What do you want? How about I pay you to walk away? How much? How much do I have? Um… Let's see. Um, that's twen... 45, 46, 47. That's ten, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100. Oh, shit. Two hundred. Three hundred, 400. - That's $447. - Mmm. You're looking at this? Okay. - That's a Rolex Submariner. - Yeah, I know what a Rolex is. You must be drunk. Yeah, maybe I am. I'm sorry. Sorry. Have a good night. Don't you fucking move. Wait up. Let's talk. I've got a wife and I got two kids, and I'm just trying to provide. And this one has it coming because she is a fuckup. - Eat shit. - Keep it up, Sandy. Keep it up. How much is this gonna cost? - Five grand. - Good night. No, no, no. No, no, no. I just saw your car and you are walking around here, sporting an $8,500 watch, that you were just gonna give me. I only have $447. - I'll take the watch. - That's 8,500. Like you said. Hmm. Eighty-five hundred, new? Correct? What is it used? Maybe seven? Maybe. So, give me the watch and I'll give you the change. Thanks. Happy holidays, motherfucker. It wasn't real? Get in. I gotta give you your cut. - My cut? - Your money. Thousand dollars. Got a knife on me. Great. Come on, it's freezing out. Have a seat. You can take your jacket off. Don't try any shit. - Now take off your shoes. - Fuck you. I need to trust you. I'm not a junkie. Roll up your sleeves. You can sleep there. Or you can leave. And what happens if I stay? You work for me. Morning. What's your favorite movie? What's my favorite movie? Yeah, what's your favorite movie? Titanic. That's a classic. - You like that movie? - Of course. DiCaprio was so young in it. Honestly, he's never been better. I liked him in The Departed. He's okay, but Titanic, that's the movie that made him. And Kate Winslet was so beautiful. And the end. I'll still never get over that. Can't believe you like Titanic. I don't. I've never seen it. - You've never seen Titanic? - No. I don't watch movies. They're a waste of time. But I gave you the impression that I did, and that's what we're gonna do with you. We're gonna give people the impression that you're somebody that you're not. And when I'm done with you, it's gonna be 100% convincing. We're gonna teach you a little about everything. So that you can lie about anything. Read those cover to cover. You fucking kidding me? What did you do with that $1,000 that I gave you? In my jacket. Why? From now on, each time you curse, I get a hundred. Fuck that! That's my money. Now I get 200. You still got 800 left. Read those. What's your name? It's Max. Merry Christmas, Max. Merry Christmas, Sandra. Sandy. Everybody calls me Sandy. Not anymore. Max! Let me in. I promise I won't do it anymore. Please! Max! Please, please, please! I need you clean. You understand? I gotta trust you. Anna Karenina. "All happy families are alike, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own..."

Yes. Why did you pick me? - I saw something in you. - My brother's coming into town. Every time I see him though, he always asks for money. - Do you give him money? - Sometimes. He's all I've got. You know, I'm from Seattle originally. I've got a mom there. - She's crazy, but she's all right. - What did you major in? - Hmm? - At Vassar. What did you major in? English.

And here we were having such a nice time. - What can I get for you, miss? - Vodka martini, please. How do you do? I'm good. Hi. Thank you. Can I buy you a drink? I hate drinking alone. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. I'm Sandra. - I'm William. - Nice to meet you, William. It's nice to meet you too. I have a confession. Oh, yeah. What's that? Noticed you at the bar. I have a thing for older men. Wow. You got a thing, huh? A bad thing. What's the matter? Daddy didn't love you enough? Daddy wasn't around much. You're married, aren't you? Yeah, that's what the ring on my finger says. I wanted to fuck you since the second you walked in tonight. I'm going to tell you what I'm gonna do to you, all night… - What's that? - Mmm. Just ignore it. It's just turndown service. Um… - Hold on one second. Don't move. - Yeah. Fucking bitch. Don't you think I fucking knew it? I knew you were fucking him. - What are you doing here, huh? - I'm calling the front desk. - I love you. Do you understand that? - Jason! - Relax! - Shut up! - Jason, calm down! - Are you fucking him? Are you fucking my girl? Did you fuck my fucking girl? - I'll fucking kill you! - He didn't...

I'll... Just-Just go down back to the bar… You're a fucking liar! …and I'll meet you in half an hour. - Okay? Yeah. - Okay, fine. - You sure you're gonna be okay? - Completely. - Goddamn it. Fine. - He's calming down. - Yeah. I'm so sorry. Yeah. Got it. Okay. - Just... Keep it down, okay? Fuck. Well done. You figured it out. You're a natural. Right? You were quick, you stayed cool. You improvised. That's what we do. What the fuck? Shit. I'm surprised people still walk around with cash. Ah, and of course. Diamond earrings for the poor wife who sits at home and waits for her husband while he preys on young women. I wouldn't say he was preying on me. We sort of set him up. Don't do that. - What? - Don't feel sorry for him. You can't cheat an honest man, right? That's why we never feel sorry for the mark. They look good on you. What are you doing? Happy birthday, Max. Thank you. Enjoy the evening, sir. Max. You made it. Richard, I want you to meet my son, Max. - Hi, Mom. - Hi. - You look great. - Heard so much about you. I wish I could say the same. Well, maybe if you returned a text or actually picked up the phone and called your mother every once in a while. I'm very busy, Mom. I'm sorry. Your mother tells me you were in St. Barts. - Yeah, I was. - Yeah. I had some fun times there myself. Uh, back in the '70s. - You're old. - Max. That's, um... I'm... Come... Come with me, I wanna talk. - Come on. Come on with me. Yeah. - Really? I'm so sorry. Come. Come on. Let's go. Excuse me, sir. - Hi. - No, stop that. Come on. - You look great. - Hey. What is the matter with you? - What? - You are so rude. - What do you know about this guy? - Honey, he's a public figure. Anything you wanna know, you can just Google him. You can't be alone for two minutes. You throw yourself into these relationships. This is different. It really is. Sure it is. Go easy on that, please. I think you've had enough. Stop being my mom, Mom. Wh... Sweetheart, what is it? What's going on? I thought you were gonna bring your girlfriend tonight. Where is she? Seeing somebody else. I see. I'm sorry. I never liked her. I think she was a bad influence. Can I stay here for a little while? Okay. Um... Uh… …Are you using? No, I'm not using drugs. I haven't done drugs in a year. It's just that I-I can't go through that again, - and that can't happen here. - Mom, I'm clean. My God. What the fuck is... What do you want? You want me to prove it to you? A fucking piss test? - Is that what you want? Huh? - Stop. What? What are you doing? - Here. I'll do it right now! Okay? - No! No, don't. Stop! Stop! - You can see for yourself! - Don't do that. Stop it right now! Prove it to you. Go ahead. - Test it. - Please don't do this to me. Test it! Please. Please. Please. Please, don't do this to me. Mom, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mom. Why do you do this? Why do you do this to me? I'm really sorry. Just... I still need a place to stay, okay? Please? You can stay. Just not for very long, okay? Thank you. I love you. Thank you. You enjoy the show? I'm so... I'm so sorry. I'm... I'm so... I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. He spent the last year putting together a company to charter boats in the Bahamas, but then the hurricane wiped that out, which is too bad because he was so happy. - He was doing so well... - Madeline. Uh, how does he live? Well, his father left him some money, and, um... Mmm… I help him out from time to time. Of course you do. I was so young when he was born, you know? And then his father died, and I'm suddenly a widow, and I didn't always know how to be a mother. It's up to him to do better. He-He's an adult. No, he isn't. And that's my fault. He's always been my little Max. And he can't swim without me. Morning, Mom. Hi, sweetheart. How'd you sleep? Great. Room's got an amazing view. Good. Um... Well, I, um... I actually have an appointment downtown, but I was thinking, um, if you were free that maybe we could have lunch together. Um, at one o'clock. Via Carota? - Sounds great. - Okay. Perfect. See you later. Bye, honey. Richard? I'm sorry about yesterday. I took a Klonopin, and I had a lot of drinks. Max, we're gonna be in each other's lives for the foreseeable future. Let's make the best of it, shall we? You know, your mother and I are attending, uh, a benefit tonight for the Richard Hobbes Foundation. My late wife founded it. We make all sorts of charitable contributions. Uh, did you want me to make a donation? Because, honestly, I'm a little light right now. No. No, I figured you might wanna join us. There's a gonna be a... A few very hip musical acts. They tell me they're quite relevant. There's gonna be a lot of young people your age. Lot of young women. Thank you, but I think I should just stay in and rest. Yeah. Fair enough. Well, you were terrible. You treated him like a waiter. I still have no idea who he is. No, he's... he's on that TV show. He plays a spy. He's very famous. All night, all I could think about was being alone with you. You're alone with me now. I don't care about actors. You should know that. I just want you all to myself. - Sir, calm down. - I asked you to identify… Sir, the police are here. - Police? Hey! What's going on here? - Fuck does that even fucking mean? - Sir, excuse me. I'm, uh, NYPD. - Oh, my G... Detective Collins. Does this young man live here? - Well, he's staying here. - I don't fucking live here. - What did you do? - Nothing. I didn't do anything. He solicited drugs from an undercover officer. You came up to me and tried to sell me fucking cocaine. - And you said yes. - Don't put words in my mouth. - Detective, how bad is this? - It's not looking good. He has a few offenses. We ran his name, and he's looking at doing some time. - Oh, my God. Max. - Wha... What happens now? - I'll take him downtown... - Fuck that, dude. I'm outta here. Get your fucking hands off of me! Richard! Richard, please. Stop him. Stop him! Calm down! - Fuck! - Detective, can we talk about this? - Fuck. - Now? I make large donations to the NYPD every year. Yes, sir, I'm aware of that. That's the reason for the courtesy call. It's why I'm here. I know the commissioner. Marty is a good friend. - I can put in a good word for you. - Richard, you don't have to do that. My word carries weight in this city. That can cut both ways. I really appreciate what you've done, coming here. Uh, I don't know, sir. I'm gonna pay you for your time. I c... I can't do that. No, I'm... I'm sorry. Take the fucking money, Detective. - Stop. He's not a cop. - What? - Ma'am, ex... - Shut up. This is... This is what Max does. He plays these… …these little confidence games. That's what this is, isn't it? This is... This is one of your games, right? - I can assure you that I'm... - You get out. Get out or I really will call the police. I mean it. Get out of here. Tipsy, I mean, I think... - Dude, fuck. - You better... You better go. - Do you think this is funny? - Why'd you fucking break? Do you think this is funny? Come on, man. - You okay? - Get out of here. Get out of here. - Oh, okay. - Sorry. I'm sorry. - I'll call you later. Thank you. - All right, dude. Hope I catch you later, bro. Oh, my God. Mom, listen. I gave you everything, you know. You... You had every advantage. You... You didn't... You didn't want for anything, and this is what you do to me? - You humiliate me in front of him? - It's just a little... I want you to leave. I don't want you here anymore. All that work for $1,000. Let me give you a piece of advice, Max. If you're gonna steal, steal a lot. I'm sorry I hit you. Forget it. No, I took it too far. Let me see. Is it too early for a drink? I don't like the way you look at him. Oh, come on. You like him a little bit. Of course I like him. He's a billionaire. That's not what I'm talking about. Look, I feel really good about this. We're very close. He wants to meet with you at his office at one o'clock. Mmm. Well, maybe I don't wanna do this anymore. Why not? Don't be jealous. You know I don't like old men. You know what I like. Okay. No. Tell me what I like. - You like me. - Mm-hmm. I like you. Why do I like you? Because I get you what you want. So, get me what I want. Get me what I want. Okay. Max, thanks for coming. Hey. Are you okay? Oh, yeah, it's just maintenance. Here, follow me. I wanted to apologize about last night. It was inappropriate. That's a hell of an understatement. You know, when your mother first told me about you, she said that you were well-educated, smart, clever. I thought, you know, I'm always on the lookout for a young man like that. - Are you offering me a job here? - No. I doubt if you'd want one. What are you doing here? Did you schedule a meeting? No. I didn't know that I needed one. What is it, Tom? I'm back. Yeah, I can see that. So, what is it? Just wanted to say hi, see how you're feeling… - Now is not a good time. - All right, cool. See you around, Dad. Tom. Come on, in here. That was my son. I always assumed he would inherit all this. Then his mother died and he didn't take it well. He doesn't have the fortitude to work here. He's weak. Hmm. When he turned 21, I offered him anything he wanted. You know what my son asked for? I don't know, Richard. A signed copy of Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre. Now he wants to open a bookstore. Not exactly a sound investment. No. But I'm gonna give it to him anyway. You know why, Max? Because we only get one life. And I will not be my son's jailer for his brief time on earth. I want you to be honest with yourself, Max. If I were to hire you to work for me, how do you think it would end? Not well. I agree. Still, I want to offer you a job. I'm thinking $60,000 a month. Sixty grand a month? For what? To go out and find opportunity. Make a mark for yourself. You want me gone. You cause your mother anguish, Max. And I will not have it. So, what am I then? A bad investment? I didn't get where I am making bad investments. Is that what I'm worth, Richard? Sixty thousand dollars a month? I'm offering you an opportunity. I want a year's salary up-front. That can be arranged. I'll just transfer the money in... Transfer the money? No. What? So I can pay taxes? Hire an accountant? No. I want cash up-front. Get me the cash and you get my mom all to yourself. I'll be gone. You won't even hear from me. Not even a fucking postcard. Wait here. - We did it. - We did it, baby. Where the fuck is my money? Y'all look good. - Let's go. - Whoo! - Yeah! - Let's do it. Here we go. We got the big Gs, buddy. Yo, wait, l-l-l-look. - There is this new guy named Goldie. - Mm-hmm. - He from, like, LA. - Yeah. He started out working as a stuntman before he was grifting, or whatever the fuck we doing. He started working as a stuntman. Crazy. He comes highly recommended and he's looking for a score. And I need y'all. - Tipsy… - Oh. We're out. Oh, come on, man. What you... What, y'all retiring? - No. No, no, no. No. - That's it? What y'all gonna do? Do the whole... Come on. Uh, w... No, we're taking... - We're just gonna take a vacation. - We're... We're... Yeah. - Taking a vacation. - Okay. Well, y'all let me know - whenever y'all get back. Okay? - Okay. Y'all gonna wanna meet him. - Big shit, all right? - Mm-hmm. Hey. You're bullshitting me. Where my money at? Come on. What? - That's it. Tipsy, that's it. - No. Um, we had expenses… - We handled some expenses. - …that we didn't account for. Yeah, okay, but this... No. No, no. Thi... This isn't what we agreed on, man. - I know, but things change. - Yeah. This is becoming a habit with y'all two. I'm starting to feel like I'm the mark. - Now we're laughing about it. - No. Come on, man. No. - No, no, no. - Uh-uh. Absolutely not. It was a beautiful con though, right? You can thank Madeline... Madeline for that. Stop it. Stop it. Thank you, Madeline. You're welcome, Tipsy. You're welcome. - Thank you, Tipsy. - Yeah. Thank you for everything, man. - I'll ca... I'll call you. - Yeah. For sure. - Y'all stay warm, all right? - Bye. - Three quarters of a million. - Not bad. Now what? I'm gonna go home. I'm gonna get my stuff. And, um, I'm gonna tell him that I have a sick aunt in Jersey. And I'm out first thing in the morning. You love me? Unfortunately. Hey. Hey. So… I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is the money is all yours. Okay. What's the bad news? Uh, the bad news is you were right. Right about what? The old man loves me. He wants to marry me, so I'm staying. What are you talking about? Maybe I don't wanna sit around in a bar all day pulling short cons for the rest of my life. You can't be serious. Sooner or later the old man is gonna ask questions. No. No, he won't. He's too invested. He's got too much on his mind. You know, his health and his business. And that... that emotional wreck of a son. But I'm the good thing, right? I'm the good thing he's got. Yeah. I know you. You stay, you'll slip. No, I won't. I'm too good. And if they're not looking for you, they don't see you. Are you really doing this? Um… Yeah. I don't wanna play the mom anymore. It's boring. Max Burnett, it's the police. We have an outstanding warrant for your arrest. Open the door. I don't believe you. Who's at the door? Tipsy? Oh, you better go. You're bluffing. Yeah, well, then call my bluff and open the door. Open the door. So, you used me? Max Burnett. - Fuck. - Open the door. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna need a minute of your time to go over Richard's will. There are documents that are time-sensitive. And also, I think it's best we do it right away, for Tom's sake. - Okay. - Okay. Richard dictated this last draft of the will to me personally, and then he signed it. And because he was at the height of his sickness, I feel it's my obligation to assure you that he was cogent and of sound mind when he did so. Richard left the bulk of his estate to Madeline. That's ridiculous, this… It should be Tom's. Richard was very clear. After the past incident with Tom… - I had $350,000 stolen from me. - He had major misgivings… - And I had a nervous breakdown. - …leaving Tom both the business and the estate. You'll be taken care of through a trust. It's generous. And it will allow you to hold on to your bookstore. Tom will also retain control of the charity, the Richard Hobbes Foundation. As for everything else, property, assets, shares, stocks, the remaining 9.2 billion… It will all go to Madeline. Well, at least he trusted me with the Foundation. He did, Tom. You're chairman of the board. And Madeline has been named trustee. I'm a trustee? It's only a formality. A piece of insurance in the event Tom is unable to fulfill his duties - and Madeline will... - Will take over. Yeah, I get it. He trusted you with control of the Foundation. I can tell you that with complete sincerity. - He thought the world of you. - Yeah, okay. No offense, but my father's last wishes tell me exactly what he thought of me. David, I'd like to be alone with Tom for a minute, - if that's okay. - Of course. Of course. Um, thank you. Thank you. I am so sorry. - Don't be. It's not your fault. - No, I just... I want you to know that I'm your partner. And that I'm here for you. I'm here for whatever you need. You don't have to go through this alone. Thank you for saying that. You can stay with me for as long as you like. You don't have to move out anytime soon. But I'm gonna have to sell this apartment because I can't do it. I can't... I can't stay here alone. I just can't. I can't manage it. - I don't know why I brought this up. - Okay. I shouldn't... I shouldn't... - No, I get it. - I shouldn't have brought it up right now. We can discuss it some other time. - I think it's just a lot. - It's okay. It's okay. It's a lot for both of us to handle right now. - Thank you, Patrick. - You're welcome, Miss Hobbes. - Good morning, Charlie. - How are you, Miss Hobbes? I'm gonna check on the room. I'll be right back. Thank you so much. …Mrs. Hobbes. Oh, wow. Ooh. This is so pretty. May I see the other tray? Yes, of course. - I have to tell you something. - I think I saw… Please, come this way. Tom is expecting you. He's gonna be bored out of his mind. Come talk to me in 20 years. I'll be dealing with the exact same thing. You know what I'm saying? Oh, Mrs. Hobbes. Good morning. I'm Pat Braddock. We met briefly at your husband's memorial service. Yes, of course. How do you do? I'm good. Thank you. These are my associates, Mr. McCabe, Mr. Mosely. We're here to see Tom. We're doing a bit of business for him. What kind of business? Pat, hey. - Oh. - It's okay, Madeline. - Braddock is an old family friend. - Hi, Tom. Good to see you. He did work for my father whenever he had anything sensitive he needed taken care of. Actually, Madeline, uh, I want you to see this. Tom enlisted our help to find the young woman who committed the theft. After running her picture through the system, we landed on this woman. We think this is her. - That's her. - All right. So her name is Sandra Carmichael. She was born in Seattle. Rough childhood. Talked to the mother, but she hasn't spoken to her in several years. Okay, she, uh, drops out of high school at 16, starts racking up a number of offenses. Shoplifting, possession, assault. But then she develops a habit, and she crisscrosses the country until she makes her way to Queens, where she's arrested again for possession. She gets paroled and that's where the trail runs cold. Okay, so that's it. She's a drug addict. Well, frankly, it raises some questions. - What kind of questions? - Yeah, like what? What she pulled required a great deal of sophistication. I don't see how this woman did it alone. I think we're looking for more than one person. - We'll keep you posted. - Thank you. I really appreciate this. - We're gonna get 'em. - Okay. No… …I trust you. - We'll talk to you soon, all right? - Okay. Yeah. Hi! Hi! - I didn't know you could cook. - Not bad for a trophy wife, huh? I mean, your dad told me what you said about me. - Sorry. I didn't know you then. - Oh, I don't care. - It was more about him. - I honestly... I really don't care. You hungry? Uh, yeah. I could eat. Let me just put my stuff down. Did you have any luck finding that girl? Uh, not yet. Uh, Braddock had a lead down in Miami but it was a bust. Honey, you know, what these people did to you was awful and confusing and unfair. But I don't think that finding her is gonna make you feel any better. I disagree. Yeah, well... Okay. Hang on, I... I have something I wanna show you. So, I, um… …started looking for apartments for you. These are all downtown near the bookstore, so it wouldn't be much of a commute. - What is this? - Well, I told you. I'm gonna have to sell this apartment, so I want you to find a place. I know, but I don't need you to do this for me. But I want to, sweetheart. - I wanna help you with this. - I get that. I'm just saying that - I can find my own apartment. Thank you. - Why are you getting upset? - I'm not. - No, you are. - No, I'm not. I'm just... - You totally are getting upset. - You can't come here and do this… - No, but I want to. - …and expect me not to react. - I wanna be a part of this. - It's not your problem. You're not my mom! - No, you're right. I'm not. 'Cause if I were, I'd tell you to grow the fuck up. People get their hearts broken every day. It happens to everybody, okay? All the time. But most kids aren't entitled enough to hire men to find the girl who did it. She stole money from me. That's not why you're doing it. You want to see her again. Right? You can lie to yourself, but you can't lie to me. I'm sorry. That was harsh. - You think I'm a loser. - No, I don't. - Yeah, you do. - No, I don't think that you're a loser. I think that… I think that you're human. I think we're all human. We're just doing the best we can. I'll have Braddock call it off. Good for you, sweetheart. I know it's hard. This apartment is unlisted. You're the first people to see it. Oh, that's exciting. - This is a great neighborhood. - Hello? - There are lots of young people here. - Yeah? Well, Tom has a bookstore - on Thompson Street… - Yeah. Okay. - …so this may be absolutely perfect. - Bring her to the apartment. Yeah. - Honey, what... what's going on? - Okay. Thanks. Um, they found her. I... I... I thought you told them to stop looking for her? Well, I did... I did. Uh, but they had one last lead and they found her. Um… - Where is she? - They're bringing her to the apartment. I just wanna talk to her. I have to go. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. We're gonna have to do this another time. Thank you so much. - We've got her in the guest room. - Okay. She was living in the Lincoln Motel off the Cross Bronx Expressway. And she has a serious heroin addiction. She's fallen since you've seen her, Tom. All right? Hold on. Just wait a second. We gave her a sedative to calm her down, but she's gonna be experiencing some pretty heavy withdrawal so... - Can I go in and talk to her? - I'm gonna go with you. No. I'm okay. Did she say anything else? You have any more insight? Not yet. You all right, sweetheart? Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay. It's weird. It's like, it's her, but it's not her. Did she tell you anything? Yeah, you were right. She wasn't working alone. There was... There's this guy who was her accomplice. He taught her everything and trained her. He planned the whole thing. She said that he has some sort of connection to... to us. What kind of connection? She said that he knew all about me. She said that it seemed personal. Did she describe him? - Did she say what he looked like at all? - No, but he cheated her too. He left her with nothing. I told her she could stay here… - Oh, no, no, no, no. She can't stay here. - …and, um… - She's sick… - No. - …and she needs a place to detox… - No. - …and she regrets what she did. - She's a junkie, you can't trust her. - She's gonna do anything to get money. - I agree. - Very easy for me to do. - No. She's staying here. I'll take care of her. I'll bring doctors or nurses, or whatever. - But I wanna do this. - Mr. Braddock, this isn't safe. - I need your help with this. - Well, I... Look, I can put men outside her room. She'll essentially be under lock and key. That's not what I'm worried about. But, come on. I mean, are you ready for when she sobers up - and you have to see the real her? - I'm dying to see the real her. Okay. If she's gonna stay here, then I need to talk to her. - No, wait. She needs to rest. - No, I should. Sandra? Sandra? Hi, I'm Madeline. I was married to Tom's father. I'm his stepmother. Suck my dick, you lying bitch. Yeah, I know who you are, Madeline. Max told me the whole score. That you set the cops on him, but then had to beg him to come back. How there was an old man who was dying and was gonna leave behind a fortune, and all we needed to do was… nudge aside the son so that his very full of shit widow could inherit it all. So, what do you want? I wanna confess. Confess to it all and get this off my chest. Do me a favor and get Tom. Tom? How much? I don't want your money, bitch. You don't? Max and I were supposed to meet at Penn Station. I waited there for three days. Because I was so fucking stupid, I thought something had happened to him. Can you believe that? He left me. Then what can I do for you? I want Max. I wanna see Max. I wanna look into his face, and I want him to see what he did to me. I wanna see Max. Honey, I don't know where he is. Well, you better find out. Or I will tell everyone in the next room who you really fucking are. She can stay. Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice message system. When you are finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options. So, I have a problem. They found your girl getting high off the Cross Bronx Expressway. And now she's in my apartment pining after you. You really did a number on her, didn't you? You d... You didn't have to go that hard. I mean, what the fuck did you tell her? Call me. Where is he? Where is he? Did you find him? Did you find him? When you are finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options. Max. Uh, hey, it's me again. Um, can you give me a call? Max told me the whole score. And I know who you are. Please call me back. I need you. I want Max. I wanna see Max. I wanna see Max. Just please call me back. Come on, Max. Please. Or I will tell everyone in the next room who you really fucking are. Listen, I came back like you asked. I gave Tom a nervous breakdown. I got my money. Now I'm out. Uh, yeah, but I, um... It's just that I, um… I think… I want you back. You want me back? Yeah. You want me back to fix this. Fuck, yes. - Put that down... - Yeah, I know that's right. - Okay. And then I'm gonna... - You're winning… …so I don't understand why you have so many questions. Are you cheating me? You hustling me? Hi. How's our young patient doing? - I'm doing a lot better. Thanks. - Yeah, last night was rough, - but I think we're over the hump. - Mmm, that's a relief. You look a lot better. I was gonna take a walk. Do you want to join me? Uh, no. Uh, you know, she's still not 100%. I think the fresh air might do her good. - Uh, I don't know about that. - No. - A walk would be perfect. - Oh, good. Brought you a sweater. That was fast. Where was he? You can ask him yourself. We have a deal, right? Once you see him, you get out of my life. - I don't want anything from you. - Good. How can you do what you do? Practice. Where are we going? This is good. You left me! You li... I waited for days! You fucking left me! How could you? You threw me aside like I was fucking trash! Oh, my God. Please. You done? You got taken. That's what we do. So now, the question is, how do we make this right by you? I want him to apologize. Well, he can't. Because he's not sorry. Did you feel anything for me? I felt nothing. What the fuck is this? Shit. What did I tell you? She's used these two to swipe your inheritance right out from under you. What? You have nothing to say? The inheritance belongs to Tom. And you're gonna give it back to him. It's his money. If it was Tom's money, he would have his money. But it's my money. And you know what I'm gonna do with my money? I'm gonna take a billion dollars and aim it in your direction. Your three-bedroom in Scarsdale or Lloyd Harbor, or whatever the fuck. It's gone. Your Benz. Gone. Your kids' college fund. By the time I'm done with you, it's all gone. 'Cause it's all about the money for you, right? That's all any of you care about is the money. Right, Sandra? Hey! Say something! Answer me! - Whoa! Hey, hey. Tom. Tom. No. - Hey! Hey, hey. You've been fucking with me since we first met. - Tom… - Put the gun down. Put it down. You took everything. - I'm sorry. - You're a fucking liar. Don't say... Tom, put it down. Come on. Put the gun down. - Put the gun down. Tom. - Put the gun down. I meant what I said, Tom. I meant what I said. You're right. You're right. It's not you. - Tom, no! What are you doing? - Hey. No. No, no, no, no. Tom, no. You did this. You ruined us. Look at me. Look what you did to me. Look what you did to my dad! I took care of your father. I kept him alive. - Bullshit! - Tom, please don't do this. Just sh-shut up. Tom, put it do... Put the gun down, okay? Please, just put it down. Put it down. Tom, no. No! - Stay back. - Put the gun down. St... Stay back. - Put the gun down, Madeline. - You wanna kill me, Madeline? - Get back. Tom, no. - You wanna shoot me? Just do it! - Hey! Tom. - Just do it. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - What? What h... Tom? Come on. Stay with me. Tom. What the fuck? Oh, my God. You killed him. I didn't. He... He... He shot himself. You saw it. - Call the police. - I'm on it. - No! - He killed himself. I'm sorry, what? Who the fuck are you? Shut the fuck up. You're a part of this. - I need to report a shooting. - I didn't do it. I... I... - I didn't kill him. - Yes, there's been a shooting. A-A young man's been shot in the chest. I'm not sure. This... This kid is dead. This is a... This is... This is a tragedy. - But I... I... I didn't... - No, she didn't. He killed himself. I can make amends. I can... - I can make amends. - I'm sorry, what? I'll give the money back. - I'll give it to the Foundation. - What are you talking about? - You're just gonna give it up? - Yes. I don't want to go to jail for something I didn't do! No. They're coming. The police are coming. You leave us to the police and that money's not going anywhere. - Just think of what it can do. - Oh, you. They'll give the money back! Please! Please! I beg you, please! I don't wanna go to jail! What a fucking mess. Madeline Hobbes on line one. She says it's urgent. Excuse me a minute. Madeline… Hello? Is everything all right? I wanna transfer my inheritance… to the Richard Hobbes Foundation. It was Richard's wish that you receive the inheritance, Madeline. It's yours. But I want it to go to the Foundation. And I want it done today. I need you to do this, David. I need you to do this as soon as possible. Madeline, what is this? Are you under duress? No. You can tell me if something has happened. I can help. Next flight out is to Oklahoma City. We have 40 minutes. Keep moving. Madeline? Have you spoken to Tom about this? You're my lawyer, right? Yes. Of course. Then I want you to do what I say and transfer the money. All of it. We'll prepare the papers. Make it look like a robbery. You seem very calm for someone who lost a lot of money. Well, I'm a professional. You gave away billions of dollars. - Is that what I did? - Did you? I don't know. Did I? I mean, I gave the money to the Foundation. The head of the Foundation is Tom. Or should I say, was. - Tom is dead. - Mm-hmm. And so, the money is controlled by the trustee. And guess who that is? You're still talking about money. Yes. Yes, we are. Tom is dead. We killed him. We killed him. - Keep it together. - I'm gonna be sick. We gotta get rid of her. We can't. She's a witness. She knows too much. What is it? Did she get to you? No. It's okay. I mean, it happens. She didn't get to me. I mean, you can do what you want. I don't care. - She didn't get to me. - Good. Would you like some water? Thanks. - This isn't blood. - What? Look. It comes out too easily. - This isn't blood. - Let me see. If it's not blood, then what is it? Uh, you tell me. What do you mean? Are you behind this? - Behind what? - You got me to give away the money. - No, I did no such thing. - No, Tom's alive. You fucked me. - What are you talking about? - You fucked me. - I will fucking kill you. - I didn't have anything... - I will fucking end you! - I didn't have anything to do with this. Sandra. Sandra! Sandra? - Merry Christmas, Max. - Merry Christmas, Sandra. Sandy. Everybody calls me Sandy. We're gonna give people the impression that you're somebody that you're not. And when I'm done with you, it's gonna be 100% convincing. And what happens if I stay? You work for me. Is this real? This is real. How can I be sure? I really like you. I really like you too. It's my brother. He needs money. - Jason. Keep your voice... - Listen. Yo, listen to me for two seconds! I live with my dad and his new wife. He thinks I'm a disappointment. But you're not a disappointment. I love you. You can't cheat an honest man, right? That's why we never feel sorry for the mark. Max told me the whole score. There was an old man who was dying and was gonna leave behind a fortune. We just needed to nudge aside the son so that his very full of shit widow could inherit it all. I wanna confess. Confess to it all. I'm so sorry for all of this. How you doing, Tipsy? Richard's dead and Madeline got all the money. What she pulled required a great deal of sophistication. I don't see how this woman did it alone. I think we're looking for more than one person. There's a white dude named Goldie. We like to call him Goldie 'cause he got... he got, like red hair. We have to take this out of here. Yeah, you were right. There was... There was this guy who was her accomplice. He taught her everything and trained her. He planned the whole thing. No. One more time. He cheated her too. He left her with nothing. How can you do what you do? Practice. Hey, excuse me, I got a quick question. I need to know where the fuck… - …is my money? Look at y'all. - There he is. - Look like undercover cops. What's up? - What's up, baby? - How you doing? - Here's your money. Oh, okay. Not bad, Sandy. Max taught you well, I see. All right, last chance, huh? I really could use someone like you. Sorry, Goldie. I'm done. - Yeah, whatever. I heard that one before. - I'm done. - All right. We gotta bounce. - Yeah. - See you guys later. - Peace. - Take it easy. - Gonna invest in some real estate, baby. - Let's get it! - Yep! Bye, Sandy. You got a lot of money, Tom. I hope you can do some good with it. I will. - Thank you. - You're thanking me? I got everything taken from you. You also got it back. So, there's this great little Japanese restaurant on Mott Street. If you're not doing anything, dinner's on me. Well, I am single. And, uh, I kinda like being single. Mmm.
