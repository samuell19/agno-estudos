Shit. I gotta be out of here in 20 minutes. Shit. - Oh, hey, are you still going to, you still want to still give me a ride? - Not really. - C'mon, are you serious? You said you were going to give me a ride. C'mon. C'mon. Please? It's, like, right on the way. Don't make me take the bus. - Fine. 15 fucking minutes then. - I'll be ready in 10. - You're a real piece of shit, you know that? God, I told you 15 fucking minutes. Dude! You've totally fucked me! - I said I was sorry, Dez. Jesus Christ. - Sorry's not going to get me there on time. You know what would? Making your freeloading' ass take a cab. But I'm not going to do that. You want to know why? - Why? - 'Cause I'm not a fucking asshole like you. - Yeah? Well, you're starting to sound like one. - Dezzy! You trying to dodge me? It's been two weeks and I need that fucking rent money. I'm not running your goddamned shelter, I'm running a business, and there are people over me who are telling me that I have to have the money in for everyone in the building. - Lance, Lance, listen to me. Dude, I'm on my way to my fuckin' agent right now to pick up my commission check. It's two weeks late getting to me, alright? So they're fucking me, by default I'm fucking you, and we're all fucking fucked. I'm fuckin' sorry, dude. I know it's shitty but just come by later tonight and we'll settle up. Is that cool? - I'm asleep late tonight. - Alright, well, then tomorrow morning. - I'm going upstate for my sister's birthday. - Alright, then fucking Monday then, man! Work with me! - That's a three day extension, Dezzy. You better have a check in my hand by Monday, you understand me? - Yes. Like goddamn, you know that my anxiety is through the fuckin' roof right now and it's just, ya know... - [laughing] - Listen. I try to be patient, and to be kind to people, but really and truly sometimes it's just, like... What the fuck?! - You know what, darlin'? I think you just need to chill out a little bit, you know? Relax. Everything is going to be just fine. - Yeah, "Chill the fuck out, this bitch is gonna be fine." You've been saying that for three fuckin' months and that pot-bellied motherfucker back there is about 3 days from tossing me out on my ass. - Yeah, well, guess what? If he throws you out, no big deal, you can finally come stay with me. You love it. You're gonna love it. I mean, my fucking apartment is the size of the canvas you're working on right now. - Get out of my car. - Do you want to hit this? - I'm takin' this! - Thanks for the ride, babe. - I'll call you later. - You better call me later. [chuckling] - Yeah, yeah, that's what you said about Maui, too, you son of a bitch! Alright, look, I have a client here so I'll just see you tomorrow night, alright? Alright, bye-bye. Sorry about that. - Look, have you talked to Nikki St Jean lately? - Yeah, yeah, about that-- - I need a two week extension. - That's what you told me three weeks ago. - I mean, c'mon, you know how it is. But it's moving right along, you know, it's coming out great. - Nikki is pushing me to drop your pieces. - Drop my pieces? She hasn't even gotten the new one yet! - Well, she hasn't moved a piece of yours in three months and that's when she was expecting the new one. - David, I'm going broke. I can't live off of nothing. - And I can't live off of ten percent of nothing. The piece is going to get finished. - Can I see your progress? - You know I can't do that. - Then how am I supposed to convince St Jean? - You're my agent, that's your job! - Not anymore. - You fuckin' droppin' me? - Well, you're not giving me a choice. [ringtone sounding] - Hey, what's up? Fooled ya! It's Hadrian, leave a message. [ringtone sounding] - Nikki St Jean! Dezzy Donahue! You know, David and I aren't working together anymore, so I don't know what the fuck he's been telling you but the piece is gonna be ready, despite what you may have heard. Alright, call me back. [ringtone sounding] - Dez! - Hey. - Shit, you're alive? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm alive and fucking well. You holding? - It's been three months since I hear from you and this is the hello I get? C'mon-- Hey, so are you holding or what? - Of course. - Alright, I'll be there in a minute. [car door slams] [pounding on door] [door creaks open] - Well, that was fucking quick. So you famous yet or what? - Yeah, I should probably sign your dick. [both laughing] - Is that you, Dez? - 'Sup, Pops? - You still making them pictures? - Yeah, I'm still painting, you senile old fuck. - Pictures, paintings, same damn thing. - Forgive the old man. He's about 6 months away from being sent to the old folks home for good. - The second you try that I'm gonna put a bullet in my head and take you with me. - Is this all you idiots do all goddamn day, every day? - Hey, don't give me any shit. I didn't even say anything. - Yeah, keep it that way, will ya? All you do is yap, yap, yap. - You keep running your mouth, you're going to be running for your life. - Your threats are almost adorable, you know that? - Blah, blah, blah. - Can we get that stuff? - Yeah. - I have better things to do today than listen to these assholes about their disability checks. - I work! - Me, too! - Don't get ahead of yourselves. - You know, I've really picked up my game since the last time I saw you. I've got some bomb-ass options. - "Bomb-ass!" - Hey, it sells with the kids! - Alright. - Alright, so... We've got Tennessee Black. This stuff is a little bit hazy, it's a little bit smokey, it's light on the visuals. - Pass. - Black Dynamite. This stuff is real strong, but it's the perfect combo of supercharge and visual accentuation. The grooviest of nights will follow. - You rehearse this shit? - Yeah, I do. Fuck yourself. - What's up with that? - Even I don't touch this shit. Well, every once in awhile but I don't mainline it. The shit's intense. It's the closest thing they've got to a pure, uncut mix of cocaine and DMT. It's unreal. - Yeah. Yeah, I'll take that. - You want to try a bump first? - I mean, I was going to buy it, but I'll take a sample. - Yeah, of course you will. Now, with this, you've got to start slow. You do too much of this shit and you're done for. Biggest thing with this batch is you've got to find the exact right amount for your needs. So start small. Fine, not that small. Surprised to hear from you. You haven't been gettin' your shit from anybody else, right? - Nah, I've been clean. I haven't finished a painting in three months. - Well, look, you might want to stick around for a minute after you try that. Shit could be bonkers.

You know how it goes. - Uh-huh. - Ronnie was just right here. - Hey, I've got to go. I've got some shit to take care of. - What? It's barely 11! - Fuck me, are you still here? You didn't fucking listen to me! - I think we just have different definitions of the word "small." - Yeah, it's good though, right? - I can't lie. - Uh-huh. - What? What are you babbling about? - I got the best fucking Bliss in town. Knocked Dezzy here flat on her ass. - And you didn't even offer? - I've gotta go home. - I saw your new magazine cover the other day, the blood punk thing. - They hire me to do three fuckin' covers, right? So I do them, and hand them all in at the same time. This fucking bastard has the audacity to tell me that "nudity is prohibited," and he's not going to give me my payments unless I change the last two covers. Fuck you, dude! [snorting] - You should have told him to screw months ago. - And I told that little weasel one better. I told him to get fucked. Six goddamn weeks later, walkin' by the newsstand, what the fuck do I see? My goddamn issue with a fuckin' tacky-ass plastic slip cover covering up the tits and cock. - Clyde, are you still letting that one drag out? - It's "Clive," and go screw. [scoffs] - I knew it. [snorting] - And I called that motherfucker and I was trying to get a meeting with him but he wouldn't fuckin' take my call. Fuckin' weasley-ass piece of shit. When I see him and his spray-tanned mug, it's going to be a bit of a situation. - Seriously, when are you going to cut him loose? - I don't know. When something better comes along. - Brutal. - You can't leave yet! C'mon, one fucking shot! [crowd clamoring] - Look who I found. - Dezzy! - What about you and fuckin' Ronnie? You all broke up, like, twice. - You know how I am, you know how he is. The motherfucker would take a bullet for me. Plus, he's got a horsecock. - Is that all you care about? - I never saw you complaining. - So... - You going to his show tomorrow night? - Fuck no. - You know Dante, Ronnie's manager, exec, whatever the fuck I keep telling you about? - No. - Well, he's going to be there. He owns two labels. I bet he could get you some commission work. He's a big fan. - I need to finish this piece! - You need to get paid. [snorting] - Well, well, well. A tale as old as time itself. How long have you guys been in here? - Too long. - Not long enough. Dezzy decided to stay and hang out a little while longer. - Oh, yeah? - If we can give her a reason to.

The Bliss is actually what's, like, helping me curb it, and not, like, think about it for a second. - It is the Bliss. Alright? I... Christ, maybe I can ween you off of it with something a little lighter. - I think Courtney fucking killed somebody last night. - This is ridiculous. - I woke up with my face covered in blood, Hadrian.

[glass breaks] - Tell me how to make it stop! - You just have to embrace it, hon. You'll come around. - I refuse. - This isn't dope. This isn't booze. This isn't Bliss. You don't give it up. You can't. Forever. - Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you! - [laughs] - Fuck you! [indistinct whispers] [echoing] - Forever... [laughs echoing] - Dez! What the fuck? Hey! I called you like, a hundred times-- - You can't be here. - Can't be here? Look, I'm not going anywhere. Hey! Will you look at me? - Get the fuck out of my face, Clive! I don't want you here! - You look like shit in a box, Dez. Okay? I knew something was up. Courtney said this was fucking bad, but I didn't know how bad. I mean, what the fuck is going on? - What the fuck did she say about me? - She's just worried, is all-- - You tell that absent-minded bitch that the next time she wants to flutter my fucking name through her gap-toothed grin that she can say it to my fucking face. [Dezzy coughing] - Jesus Christ. Dez? [crying] - Clive, you need to leave. - I'm not going anywhere. - Please leave. Leave. Leave. - What'd you do? What'd you do? You're fucking burning up! You're on fuckin' fire, you're going to fuckin' die. - Leave! - Just stay there! Hey! Hey, hey. Hey. Dezzy, Jesus Christ. - You can't be here! - I'm not going anywhere! Let me take care of you. Please. What was it, what'd you do?! It's that fucking Bliss shit, isn't it? Hey, hey, hey. - Leave, leave. Leave! [gasps] - Fine, I'm gonna call a fuckin' ambulance. Because I'm not going to sit here and watch you fuckin' die. You better hope there's not a bunch of fucking drugs in this apartment, either. You're gonna be in a world of shit. They'll take all that shit, and all your fucking paintings... [Dezzy breathing heavily] [screaming in pain] Oh, fuck! Oh my God, Dezzy! Dezzy, no, wait, wait, wait! What the fuck?! [thud] [door creaking open] [distant woman laughing] [ominous digital music] ¶¶ [distant laughing continues] [snorting] [woman laughing continues] [door creaking open] [Dezzy screaming] - Come here, you fucking bitch! [screaming continues] [Dezzy crying] [knocking on door] - You fucking bitch, I'm gonna fucking kill you. You open this fucking door. Open this fucking door, Dezzy! Open the door, Dezzy. Open the fucking door. I'm gonna get in there and I'm gonna fucking kill you, you stupid fucking bitch! Look what you did to me! Look what you did to me! Do it. Do it, you fucking pussy! You fucking pussy, you bitch. You murderer. [banging on door] You murderer! You murderer! Oh, I'm going to fucking kill you. [gun clicks] [gun shot] [thud] [liquid sloshing] [distant woman laughing] [Dezzy gasping] [snorting] - It's almost finished. It's impressive. Tell me, Dez. Do you think it was the Bliss? Or the blood? My money's on the blood. - It's me. - You remember earlier? When you were fucking killing me?! At first I was so scared. Then I was really fucking pissed off at you. But now I get it. You wanted a partner. You chose me. - Are you fucking kidding me? Get the fuck out of here! - Now we can create together. [thud] [screaming] - Unless you ruin the heart. [liquid sloshing] Have you been snorting this shit all night? [snorting] With all those bodies you drained? Look at this shit. You dumb, untalented, shit-stain on society. You think this fucking town is a buffet? It's not. There's fucking rules! But you, with your supercharged blood pumping through your veins. Blood from our kind, and the other kind, and half a kilo of Bliss. Oh! I want it. I need it. Feel it pumping through my blood as I drain you dry. - Don't fucking do that again! - Or what? I want to see how you taste. Don't worry. You'll be fine tomorrow. Just a little hungover. [both grunting] We've fucking been here before. I'm gonna fucking eat your face off, bitch. [screams] [thud] [grunts] [screams] [banging] [grunting] [coughing] [Dezzy panting] [Dezzy screams] [grunting] [screaming] - Fuck! [whimpers] No! Please... Don't.
