Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** Will! Will! Will! Will! Will! Someone! Will, help me! Help me! Help! Hello and welcome to the Spooky Hour. Your podcast about weird stories, paranormal phenomena, and spooky legends worldwide. I'm your host, Jessy... - and this is my co-host, Will. - Hello, hello, hello! So, what'd we talk about last week, Will? Last week we talked about this interesting German legend about a vicious witch and her cursed son, that's recently been made into a popular movie series. If you guys missed that episode, or if you're just new to the podcast altogether, you can find us on iTunes, Spotify, or on Patreon... Where you can actually join our backers for about two dollars a month and receive special episodes, exclusive interviews and all of our regular episodes, just two days early. That's right, folks, we've recently uploaded an episode about the suicide forest in Japan. So, if you're into that kind of shit, I highly suggest you check it out. So, today Will has something he wants to tell our audience, that he hasn't even talked to me about yet. That's because you can't keep secrets, my dear. That is not true. [Laughter] So, two weeks ago, I received this exciting e-mail, from a Hollywood producer who stumbled upon our small but nice podcast. - Wow. - Yeah. So here's what she wrote. She said she's gonna be producing this documentary on this legend that has circulated Hollywood, that's very popular lately. She didn't get into exactly what the legend is, but she actually asked us if we wanted to take part in the physical production of the documentary! - Great! - Yeah! So I had a call with her yesterday, and I told her that you would be just as excited as I am, so we would love to be involved. That is exciting! And I got something more exciting for you, Jess... What's that, Will? We're gonna be meeting with her in just a couple of hours. And she's gonna be going over the production, the process, the whole deal, so what do you think? I think it's a great idea! I mean, we're completely prepared for that right now. Yeah, I agree, and our viewers and listeners are so excited. I'm sure you are. Now for a brief break and a word from our sponsor. DAY #1 10:50 AM WEST HOLLYWOOD So, she's a legit horror movie producer? Yeah, she did that movie we saw about a month ago. - The one with the bugs? - No. The one with our favourite transvestite killer kid. - Oh, my God. Are you serious? - Yeah! It's kind of weird that she wants to do a documentary, but... she said it's all about real life legends right now. So, she wants to do a documentary now. I mean, it's super cool. I just hope she takes this seriously. She wanted me to go alone to meet her, but... she sounded really cool on the phone. - Really? Then let's go! - Let's do this. ♪ [Electronic music] ♪ What the fuck are you doing, dude? She said she wants everything filmed, okay? We haven't even met with her yet. Yeah, but I want the whole process recorded. I mean, the more we have, the better. Don't you think? Not when you're driving. Okay, whatever. Pull up! [Car door closing] [Car remote control] So, Brenda, you'll make a start with the furniture? - I mean, what are you waiting...? - Come on, you know what she likes. [Electrical saw and working tools] [Hammer banging] - First of all...- The ones that... - No, just fix the light first. Hey! No, no, no, no... Absolutely no filming in here. You two even have an appointment? Yeah, we've a two o'clock appointment with Mrs. Laura Benott. - Documentary film makers? - Right! I'm so sorry. Come this way. - Can you put the camera away now? - It's all right. Just relax. Mr. Winston? Mr. Winston? What is it? We have the two o'clock appointment here for Mrs. Benott. Of course! Hi. I'm Mister Roger Winston. Hi, I'm Jessica. - I'm Will. - Nice to meet you. Laura is in a meeting right now but she'll be down very shortly. You can wait in my office. How does that sound? - Looks good. You're all right? - Mh-mm. You've already started filming. That's the spirit. I told you. [Hammer banging] Right this way. [Voices] [Clears throat] I understand. Yes? - Mrs. Benott, your two o'clock is here. - Oh, of course! Please, let them in. Good luck! You are William, I see. And this is Jess. - Hi. - Of course. What are you filming for? [Ahh] I figured filling more that just investigation. It'll make the documentary more interesting. Plus it will give the viewers a little look into the actual production itself. This is Dominik Braun. He's my partner. And he's putting some of the money into this particular production, but I believe he was actually just leaving. Weren't you? - Well, I guess... - Mh-mm. I got other stuff to do anyway, erm... It's not that your little documentary is the only thing we're producing here. - Laura. - Mhm. [Sighs] I'm so sorry. He is a dick, but he has the money and he's willing to spend it, so we endure the best of men. - Don't we? - Erm... I guess. Well, d'you mind if I film the briefing? I think it'll make a really nice introduction to the documentary. And right now, the viewer knows just as much as we do. Of course, then, I think it's a great idea. Actually, there was a particular situation that I did not tell you about over the phone, and it's something that's happening in Hollywood right now, where everybody wants to make this movie. They're thinking about it. I don't think. We do it. So, what's it about? Not so fast. First of all... I want to produce a documentary, not make a feature film, not found footage. Nothing like that. Not something hot that's on the market right now in Hollywood. I want to produce a documentary, about the curse... of the Wooden Devil. Have you heard of it? [Intense music] I didn't think so. It's this place in a forest that's... not too far outside of the city. It's actually very local here. And... [Drops files with a bang] These are from the police. They're the people who disappeared in that forest. And no one cared. [Tense music] But we care. Well, what exactly is the Wooden Devil? Oh, it's a myth. It's a legend. Actually, I like "curse." I think that would look really nice on the cover. The main story is about a forest ranger, and he has this territory. And one day, he just goes nuts. He makes contact with the Devil and people start disappearing. So the town next door, they come in and they hang him. And then, they burn his corpse. And they said that he possessed all of the powers from the Devil, and he just started killing everyone who purchased his territory. And the story's been proven? No... I don't know. That's for you to find out. But how? Well, my assistant and I, we did, we went to the location and we looked around and we saw the actual place, the actual forest... And there were some volunteers there and they helped us... They showed us, you know, little spots, little areas, and we took time. So now, you can go there, and maybe we'll have a documentary about this. Well, I told you over the phone. I'm in. - What do you think, Jess? - Yeah, it sound interesting. We'd have to take some days off of the university, but... Well, we'll provide everything for you. The trailer, the camera, the equipment. More information on the location, everything you need, we provide, We have it here for you. So... everything is ready. The question is... Are you? [Tense music] DAY #3 11:00 AM WEST HOLLYWOOD That Laura Benott really followed through with her promise. Look at all these camera gear. This is unreal. Take a look at this. These mini-cameras for our heads... That's gonna be awesome to film with. And... A fricking drone! Dude, who are you talking to? Our viewers. I thought we hadn't started yet. Work it! [Knock on the door] Come in! - Hey! - Hey! - How are you? - Good! All right, now, let's get one on the wets. Don't be a dick. - Hi, Will. - Hey, sexy. Hey, can I use your bathroom real quick? - Oh, yeah, sure, go ahead. - Okay. [Footsteps walking away] - Hey, Jess? - Yeah? What's she doing here? Oh, Laura said we needed a third person so we can both be on camera. Okay, but why her? You know, she took all those photography classes, remember? Why? Do you know somebody else who'll work for free? Not yet. I guess she is really good at taking photos of her food. Be nice! She likes you and you know that. [Electronic music] ♪ ♪ So... Who wants to be the non-believer of the group? Wait, why does she have to be the non-believer? Well, somebody's got to be the non-believer. Yeah, but why can't we all be like skeptical... but open-minded? Boring! Damn! Of course I can be the non-believer. I expect to see at least one ghost and one corpse. If I don't get to see that... Then I've wasted my time. I wanna see two corpses and I wanna speak to that ghost. You're so dumb! I just got an idea! - Let's go to Marcel's! - Oh, my God! I love Marcel's. They're the best food and drinks in town. Yeah, but the owner is kind of an asshole. This is my jam! Come on! Let's dance. You know I can't sing. [Both laugh] ♪ ♪ It's cool. I'll just be here by myself. Drink up. ♪ ♪ At least I have you. You're always there. DAY #4 2:30 PM LOS ANGELES [Van engine] What is taking her so long? [Moans] I think I got everything. This should cover me for the next few days. What? Hey... If I'm going to be on camera, I need to make sure I look good. We're riding in that thing? Will? Can you help me with my luggage? I just got my nails done. [Loud bang] Hey! Be careful with that! It's expensive! [Moans] [Moans] [Moans] [Moans] [Slams door] [Tense music] So, this is our trailer. I guess it's not as bad as I thought it was gonna be. Jesus, Jess! Where'd you learn to drive? Crazy look. [Chuckles] Will! What? This is my favourite part. Filming? No. ♪ Filming while you're working. ♪ Oops! [Laughs] Oh, yeah! Hello, viewers of this documentary! We're lost! And it's all Will's fault. We haven't even made it to the forest yet. We're not lost, Jess. It's right here on the map. Then why are we still driving? Because she wants us to go to this exact location. That's why. If the forest is really haunted, it's haunted everywhere. Of course. That's how it works, Erin. You're not doing anything. Here, take the map, then. I don't know how to read these things. I don't even know what direction we're in. - Are you serious? - She's blond. [Tense music] DAY #4 7:00 PM ROOTWOOD FOREST (Homebase) We finally reached our destination. After four hours of driving. At least, I think this is the destination, cos everything here looks exactly the same. - And... hopes. - Please, don't... Clumsy me. - Jess? - Yeah? Can you help Erin unload? I'm gonna go check out this place for a good start. I guess... Finally... finally we have time for girl talk. Hey, don't get too comfortable. You're stuck with me for the next few days. - I'm okay with that! - I'm not! [They laugh] This is me helping. [Chuckles] - Really? - No, I'll help. Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** All right. This is the first official entry into the documentary of "The Wooden Devil." I'm here in Rootwood Forest, with Erin, Jess and myself. We just parked our camper up here. This is where we're gonna be camping. We're just checking out the area and making sure there's... nothing dangerous, suspicious or frightening. - William! - What? Hey, Will! What? D'you find a ghost yet? Fuck you, guys! [Chuckles] [Both laughing] My God, he's going to kill us. - Okay, that one looks good. - Oh, that one's hot. - Okay. - Post that one? - Yeah, post that one. Oh, post that other one. Ha, ha, ha... very funny! It actually was, Will. [Chuckles] Do you guys take this serious at all? Yeah, we take it serious. It's just... you know... Erm... we've had a long day, and we're both kind of tired, so how about we just...? Take it easy for now and worry about the investigation stuff tomorrow? Okay, whatever. Yeah, we can start tomorrow, but... We have to find the first mark, okay? - Okie doke! - Aye, aye! So, you and I are in the trailer and Will's in the tent. - Aw, are you sure? - Oh, yeah, I'm sure. I don't wanna see any morning wood. I do. I know you do! So... do we have to wear these head-cams all night? Not while we're sleeping, obviously. Thank God, they're kind of uncomfortable. Well, suffering is the essence of success. - Oh, shut up! [Chuckles] - God! So, this space here... - is the Lady Lounge. - Hmm. We can talk about anything we want because there's no boys allowed. I like the sound of that. [Chuckles] Oh, my God, Jess... Look! Our fearless ghost hunter finding his own demons at night. Aww... poor Will. Oh, he's so cute. So, what's the deal with you and him, anyway? Hmmm... Remember that party I went to I ran into Will? Yes? Well, we kind of hooked up. - Really? - Yeah. No way! But it didn't go any further than that. But, I don't know. I kind of like him. [Tries to set up the tent] NIGHT #1 2:00 AM ROOTWOOD FOREST (Home base) [Tense music] It's 2 AM. And I'm hearing some very strange sounds coming from the trailer. I don't know where they're coming from. But I promised Will I would record if anything like this happened, so... Here I am... Oh, my God. - Erin! - Hmm! Wake up! She is completely useless. Okay. Let's check. [Tense music] Someone's here. Doesn't appear to be anything in here. [Thud] Oh, Gosh. [Breathing heavily] [Tense music] Check the bathroom. [Door slams] [Indistinct] - Jesus Christ, Will! - What are you doing, Jess? - What are you doing in here? - I'm taking a shit! There are bears out there. I'm gonna shit in the woods! Okay, so... Ahm... [Laughs] My mistake. It turns out it was just Will taking a dump. So this is the path we're gonna take today? I'm not sure exactly what we're going to see, but it should be something related to the curse of the Wooden Devil. Ladies, ready for a hike? Ugh! No rushing, please! I need coffee first. [Moans] Totally suck a dick for a quadruple fudge coconut macchiato... with a half a pump of pumpkin spice and extra drizzle on top. [Sighs] I gotta ask you this. Why didn't I get the memo about the glamping? What's "glamping?" You don't know what glamping is? It's glamour camping. [Laughs] It's... We gotta look beautiful while we're enjoying nature. - You know? - What do we got to look beautiful for? It's not like there's any hot guys here. Oh, God! I don't know! Come on! You and your pearls can make it. Really? I got this. Oh, my God. Oh, yeah. [Breathing heavily] Wow! Ha! - It's gorgeous. - Yeah. Worth it. Worth the hike. Yeah, I'd say. Aww! D'you see where Will went? I don't know. Who cares? I'm gonna go look for him. ♪ [Music] ♪ ♪ ♪ Oh, what is that? I don't know. What do you think lives in there? Agh! I don't wanna stay to find out. Yeah, I'm not sure I do either. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Are you thirsty? - Yes. - Grab some water. - Oh, Yes. Great. - Here you go. - Oh, thanks. Oh, perfect. We got a seat right here. [Moans] So, tell us William. What's wrong with you? Why so serious? I just... I wanna do this right. This is a really big deal for Jess and I. I just... I don't want to fuck this up! Doesn't mean we all can't have fun together. Yeah, but it's already the second day, and we haven't even found the first mark yet. Look, this producer woman said she doesn't expect you to find anything anyway, right? So, don't put yourself under so much pressure. You guys, come here! I found something. Well, let's get moving. Whoa! What is that? I don't know but it's creepy. Erin, I want you to film every angle of that. Sure, Mr. Hollywood. [Tense music] What's with all the names? Maybe it's some kind of memorial. I don't know. Like a memorial for dead people? Yeah, like a memorial for dead people. Why would they have a memorial all the way out here? It's not like anyone's gonna see this thing. Hold on, okay? Do any of these names look familiar you guys? Not really. Erin, why don't you take up that folder? The one that Laura gave us with all the missing people's names in it. Read me a few names from there. Okay, we got Tyler, Sarah, Jessica, Melissa, Caroline, Celine, Brandon, Nicole... Wait, wait, wait... Celine, Brandon? We got a match. What? - Come here. - Holy shit. Does that look like blood to you, guys? 'Cos it sure looks like blood to me. Dude, don't touch it! What you doing? Oh, my God! [:::] - That's blood. - Oh, my God! That's disgusting. Okay, I don't like this. So, we found a weird memorial tree right in the middle of the haunted forest. Just what you've been looking for, Will. What the hell is that? Oh, my God! Guys? Guys!! Jessy, are you filming this? Yeah, yeah... What? So, our camera girl, Erin, just found this noose stuffed in a tree. Right up where we found... names from the missing names book, that the producer of the documentary gave us. Written in blood. [Weeps] This doesn't make any sense. [Weeps] Can we go now? - Yeah, come on, guys. - Please. - Let's go. This isn't right. Come on. - Come on! - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [Weeps] That was creepy. Yeah, you guys okay? - Yeah, we're all right. - Is she all right? Mhm, she's just freaked out. You're good. Right, dear? Yeah, I'm okay. Erin... I got an idea for you. How about for the future you don't stick your hand in every hole that you come across? What? Too soon. EVENING 7:00 PM ROOTWOOD FOREST (Homebase) So, I want to tell you guys a story. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. It's a story that Laura told me. When we were in the meeting. Well, when Jess was in the bathroom for 30 minutes. Hold on! I was not pooping! - It was a really big building. - Hmm. I'm just giving you shit about taking a shit. Anyway... She told me why all these villagers thought that their friends and family went missing here in Rootwood Forest. - Because of the Wooden Devil, right? - Yeah. So... Seeing that bloody face we saw earlier, made me think of the story again. I didn't think I was originally gonna have to tell you, guys. - But I do now. - Don't remind me, please. So, the first person... that was rumored to have gone missing in this forest, was a little girl and her dog. The little girl wasn't allowed to go in the forest alone. So she'd play with her dog on the outside of the forest. Every day. One day her dog ran in the forest. She was calling and looking for it. She couldn't find it and the sun started to go down, so she panicked. She ran in the forest. And then? Well, she didn't find her dog. But she found these faces painted on trees... Just like the one we saw earlier. - So, what? - So? She's a little girl! She followed the faces deep into the forest. It took her to this big tree, and on this big tree was hanging a noose. - Will, that's sick! - Well, that's what the story is! - So, Laura told you all this? - Yeah! I mean everything here's a story, but... that's why we're here. Hey, I didn't sign up for any of this real shit. So, the story goes... The villagers walked in the forest looking for the little girl. And they found her... hanging from the noose. They said it was the Wooden Devil that convinced her to hang herself All right, that's it, guys. I'm going to bed. Wait, hold on, Erin, it's just a story. Sorry, Jess, but... I've had enough for one day. All right? Good night. What? You're an asshole. It's just a story. That's why we're here! This is so... So sensitive. Will. - What? - What are you doing in here? Oh, I'm slitting your fudge. [Animal sounds ] - That's a funny shape. - Shhh! Listen. [Horn-like sound] What is that? Wow! I don't know what that is. It's like howling. How long has that being going on? I don't know. I just woke up. I think it's some kind of animal or something. I don't know what that is. Here. Let's go see if we can get it on camera. ♪ [Tense music] ♪ [Animal horn-like sound] Did you hear that? Yeah. It was actually really creepy. That didn't sound like a howling thing. No, it doesn't sound like a coyote either. [Moans] [Moans] [Indistinct] Jess? Are you in here? Jess is gone and the goddamn lights don't work. Are fucking kidding me? Well... This is a campfire or something? I don't know. Is this a symbol of some kind? What you think that means? I dunno, it doesn't look like anything's been burned. And she left her phone here. Of course she did. Why wouldn't she? Will! Jess? Where are you, guys? [The van is shaking] What the...? What the hell was that? [Animal horn] [Screams] - Is that Erin? - Oh, my God, it's Erin! - Erin! - Erin! - Erin! - Erin?? - Erin! - Erin! Huh, you're okay? There was something out there. I saw it. Erin, no, it was just us who were up there. No, not you...! I saw it. Like some sort of bat creature that... I don't know... something. Erin, relax... Jess and I were just out there. There's nothing out there. Do you think I'm stupid? No one is saying you're stupid, okay? What are you doing? I'm done with this shit. This is crazy. I am done. I'm going. If this is a fucking joke, then you two can enjoy it on your own. It's the middle of the night. - Go away! - Erin! Erin... it's dark out there, don't be stupid! Just shut up, William! I'll order a rideshare. Okay, you two can enjoy your spooky-ooky ghost hunting shit on your own. Okay, I'm done! I'm splitting. Jesus! What's that? Oh, God! If there is clown in here, I am so out of here! Well, it's kind of the cleanest spot to sit at and relax for a bit, I guess? Really? I blame you guys for this. Well, I guess I'd better touch up my lips if I'm gonna still be in camera. I can't believe you guys just left me. You didn't even stop me! Okay? Like... Really? I mean, I'm leaving... and you didn't even stop me. You didn't even try! You should have known there was no rideshares anywhere around here. There's no sign of civilization. I mean look! Nothing! Absolutely nothing! And you just let me leave! Wow! Wow! Its's beautiful. Beautiful, huh? - We should rest here. - Yeah. - I'll try calling Erin again. - All right. She keeps declining my calls. That's a good thing isn't it? I don't know, I mean, I hope she's okay. No, at this point I don't really care, like... we're falling behind schedule, we got to find something, like this is our big break. Okay? And I'm not gonna let some... spoiled girl ruin this experience for us. Whoa! Sorry, Jess... Okay, I'm just I'm frustrated. Like this is the third day and we still haven't found our first mark yet. Well, have you watched the footage? No, I haven't. We haven't filmed enough yet. I'm hoping, you know, maybe tomorrow, but we gotta find something like big today. Okay, I mean, we've... We found some things. It's just nothing major yet but... I'm optimistic. Yeah. I mean, I'm hoping that all this is... you know, building up to something. I know. I just hope Erin's okay. This isn't like her. I mean you know her better than I do but... Yeah, I hope she's all right. You know, with her declining your calls I'm sure she's she's home. You know, I mean, she left. She was pissed at us last night. That's true. Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** Why are all the marked places so far from where we camped? So much walking? I think she wanted us to staying close to the road. Mhm, maybe, I don't know. I mean, if something happened... like there was an accident or health issues... God forbid like... We're right by the road but you just hop on and we're on here. - Makes sense to me. - Yeah, you're probably right. Speaking of accidents... I don't find a bathroom soon, I'm gonna accident myself. Hold on! You need a tree to take a piss? What are you? A dog? That's what they call me! Like... What a douche... Hey, Jess! Come here! You'd better put your wiener away first! It's another noose. Is that blood? Looks like it. Who do you think it's doing this? I don't know... I think like a cult or something. Definitely fits that story you told. Yeah. So, what's on the agenda for tomorrow? Tomorrow I think we should find the last mark in the map. Which is weird because all the marks felt that that interesting. You find all the good stuff in the way to the marks. It's true. I mean, she was really like on a bad location to scout or something. That's for sure, man. Yeah, I think I'm gonna go to bed. I barely slept last night. - Yeah? - Yeah. - All right. - All right, good night. - Good night. Erin, it's me again, ahm... I wish you would accept my call. I... I want you to know that nobody blames you for leaving. I completely understand. It's creepy here. I'm pretty freaked out too, so... Ahm... If you could just like... Shoot me a text, or give me a call back, so that I don't worry. That'd be awesome. I'm having trouble sleeping. We'll be back in a couple days so we can talk more then. All right. Bye. Will! Will! What's going on, Jess? This was in the bathroom cabinet. What? This was in there? Who would have done that? Who would do that? I don't know, Jess. I mean you're sleeping here, I'm out there, like... Maybe it was Erin. Maybe she's fucking with us? She was really pissed off. D'you think she would've done this? I don't know what would motivate her to do this. She's my friend. I don't know... How did they get in here? I don't know. Wait a minute. It was you, wasn't it? For your stupid fucking documentary, right? Hold up a second! I did not do this! Then who else would have done it? I don't know, I... - It had to be you! I didn't do it! - It wasn't me, it wasn't me! Okay. I need to go have a cigarette. Jess! It's dangerous out there! We don't know who's doing this! Fuck! Jess? - What? - Come here. What is it? Sit down. What the fuck is that? I don't know. Loose teeth? Holy shit! You left this camera on. That thing was in our trailer? This is what Erin saw. Oh, my God she was right! She wasn't fucking with us. Oh, God, I hope she's okay. - We gotta get out of here! - Jess! - I'm not fucking staying here no more. - Jess! Jess, Jess, calm down. - No! - Calm down! - We need to call the police. Calm down, okay? This is what we came here for. We didn't come here to find footprints in the woods. We have proof now that something weird is going on here. - Are you out of... - This is awesome! You're out of your fucking mind. That thing is gonna kill us if we don't get the fuck out of here. Jess? Jess, just one more night. We'll leave first thing in the morning. I'll rest now. I'll stay up all night. You lock yourself in here. I'll watch the trailer. We'll catch this thing on camera. I can't believe you're asking me this right now. You have lost your fucking mind. - Jess! - No fucking way. - Jess? - No! - Jess? Jess... please! Do this one thing for me. All right? One thing... We are so close here. Look at this! We are so close! This documentary could be huge. - Like this could make us famous. - Who gives a fuck? Think of the money. You and I both know we need this. Okay? If we get this thing on tape and we can prove it... Jess, it's our ticket. Please... I'm so fucking tired. I know Jess, we both are. But we can't quit, we're this close, please. Come on. - Who is that? - I don't know. It's on the roof. Oh, God. Okay, we gotta do something. Ahm... Ahm... Okay, okay... I... ahm... I'm gonna go outside. - I'm gonna go find out what this is. - No. It's gonna be okay. - No. - Jess. Trust me. It's gonna be okay. - It's not safe out there. - Just... Stay here, okay? I'm gonna be right back. - Okay? It's gonna be okay. - Okay. - It's gonna be okay. Who's out there? Hello? Hello? Hello? Erin? Erin! Erin! Oh, my God! Oh, my... Ahhh! Will! Will! Will! Will! Will! Someone! Will, help me! Help me! Will! God, help me. What the...? No! No! You gotta be kidding! No! Are you kidding me? It's not real...

It wasn't real. It wasn't real. It wasn't real. It wasn't real. Enough! Enough! That was so perfect. Great show! Hollywood could not have done it better. Not to even Netflix. And you know...? I didn't actually think you were going to be that difficult to get. She really was quite a fighter. Hey. Shut up! Don't worry! This is going to be your final fucking scene. I promise you that, okay? Because we love all of the footage that we got of you! This investment was really well worth it, and unlike your little fucking, stupid, ridiculous podcast, People are actually gonna watch this and enjoy it. And on with the final shot! Oh, and if you fuck this up, I swear to fucking Christ, I will fucking make him kill you so fucking slowly, that I will make a fucking DVD series out of it. You fucking bitch! Roger, where the fuck are you? Get the fuck in here! No, no! - Like always? - Yeah. - How was that? - Pleasing. - So... - Mhmm...? That's it? All the time for this scene? - What did you expect? - He's German. They don't know when to stop. Listen, I paid good money for that movie. - If it doesn't sell... - Of course it will sell! I have never had one dissatisfied customer yet. What... what? What's going on? Who did you invite here? No one. Roger, go get it! What the hell is going on? - Go! - Me? - Yes! An amateurish production. Hooker... Fuck you, German! At least there is a production, with the few Cents that you put it. Go! Who the fuck is that? What the fuck is going on? No, no! No. You can't be real. No! Well, that's a wrap. Everyone's dead. Laura is gonna be very pleased with what I did. They didn't have a clue. Erin... She was easy. As easy as I thought. Jess? Jess put up a fight. She was a fighter. All the way until the end. Made it a little bit more fun. Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER ***
