[brooding orchestral music] [wind blows] And Eddy boy, that old fuck, sat in there in his apartment, right over there at the Trade Winds building. Put his gun to his head and pulled the trigger. And you can't believe this. The bullet got lodged between his skull and his brain, went around his head and came out his eye socket. [sighs] Can't be. Can! He's been wearing an eye patch for the past year. [both laugh] He can't even kill himself, that guy. Can't blame him. Maybe we don't deserve to go so easily. - Here you go. - Hey. No need. Stop it, Masao. No shame. Just take it. I know when you call me, you need money! It's fine. What am I gonna do with it? What's wrong with you? If we cannot take care of each other, who will? I remember when this was all beautiful green. [somber music] [machinery groans and clunks] [jackhammer thuds rapidly] [distant dog barks] [Masao breathes shakily] [distant dog barks] [Masao coughs and retches] [distant dog barks] [Masao coughs and retches] [crickets chirp] [Masao breathes deeply] [Masao breathes shakily] [Doctor] How are your mornings when you wake up, Mr. Matsuyoshi? Masao. [birds tweet] [door closes] [melancholy piano music] You're gonna have to stop smoking and drinking. The pain and fatigue will be unpredictable. Masao... Do you have anyone that can come and help care for you? Masao? Moki. [car approaches] [leaves rustle] [distant thunder rumbles] [leaves rustle] [rain splashes] [rain splashes] [distant thunder rumbles] [door closes] [distant thunder rumbles] [faint traditional music] [muffled thunder rumbles] [beads clack] [beads clack] [muffled rain patters] [water drips] [Masao coughs and retches] [muffled thunder rumbles] [thunder rumbles] [rain splashes] [water swashes] [crickets chirp] [eerie tones] [wind blows] [brushing] [machines hum] [scissors snip] [pills rattle] [pills rattle] [water splashes] [crickets chirp] [phone rings] [phone rings] [Henry] Hello? [Masao] Henry. [Henry] Dad? [Masao] Oh. I was just thinking about when you was a little boy. [Henry] Do you know what time it is over here? It's a six-hours difference. [Masao] Right. Six hours. [phone clicks] [phone clacks] [dark tones] [rumbling] [muffled traffic whooshes and groans] They spit on me. Who spits on you, Mark? The bus does. I get to Akano's at 10 AM every morning. He yells at me. He needs you there at eight AM, Mark. Do you understand that? Does he really yell at you? The bus people spit on me. [Advisor] He's gonna lose the job. Did you think about having him live with you? [Masao] I can't take care of him. [Advisor] His sister or brother can? [Masao] Brother's on the mainland. His sister has a full house. [Advisor] Cousins? Aunties? No. No, it's just us. [door closes] Mark. [car doors slam] [Mark] Anniversary of Mom's death today. Have you seen her? [Masao] Who? [Mark] Mom. [Masao] What? [Mark] Mom. She's been coming by. She told me they're all returning. Why now? [eerie music] [leaves rustle] [dog barks] [leaves rustle] [dog barks] [dog barks] [dog barks] [birds tweet] [gentle wind blows] [cars approach] [distant chatter] Pa! - I'll get these. - Okay. Okay. - Happy birthday, Grandpa! - Happy birthday, Pa. - Brought some for you guys. - Oh, thank you. - What do you say? - Thank you. [chuckling] Dad. Dad. I got you this. Maybe it can help you. It's from the old days, before America. It's worth a lot of money. Where did you get this? A descendant of the queen gave it to me. [chuckling] What do you mean, "A descendant of the queen"? Okay, wait, wait. Make room for this. - Oh! - Oh, god. - Oh-ho-ho! Yeah! - That's for everyone. [chatting over each other] [Masao] What a meal. [Kati] Dad, do you want pork? [Masao] Oh, yes, please. - Anyone want some? - The answer's always yes. I've got my favorite over here. [Masao] Be plenty. That's a lot. [chuckling] - Wait, so you made this? - Yes. Yeah, right! [laughing] [Masao] So what did you make, Gavin? - Oh, ah... - Trouble, as usual. "Trouble." [laughing] [Gavin] I bought the plates. Oh! [laughing] [indistinct chatter] [laughing] Yeah. [chuckles] I'm not as good as you. [distant chatter] Yeah, I know all those people are, uh, kind of a [indistinct]. Who made that cake, it was like my favorite. [Kati] Mark! [pills rattle] [phone camera clicks] Come on now, let's go! - Bye, Grandpa. - Goodnight. Goodnight. - Bye, Pa. - Goodnight. [car starts] Goodnight. [car starts] Goodnight. - Bye! - Goodnight. - Bye. - Bye, Grandpa. - Bye. - Bye, doggy. [Masao] Bye. Bye. [door creaks] [dark tones] [leaves rustle] [birds tweet] [wind blows] Masao. You don't have to tell me. I know. You are sick. I can feel it. Just let it come. It is a part of you now. [Masao] It's not easy. [Friend] Just let it come and be with it. Let it in. [Masao] It's not easy. [leaves rustle] [wind blows] [Akiko] Let it in, Masao. Let it in. I'm not ready. [water laps] [banjo music] [sighs] [sighs] [wind blows] [leaves rustle] [bleak percussive music] [tumultuous bird calls] Don't look at me like that. You can see them coming, can't you? [Grace hums melodically] [eerie percussive music] [water drips] [crickets chirp] [dog barks] [suspenseful music] [door creaks] [door closes] [static crackles] [interference whines] [button clicks] [muffled wind chimes ring] [Doctor] How are your mornings when you wake up, Masao? Masao? Dad. How do you feel when you wake up? Pa? [phone rings] [Doctor] The nurse will print out a new medication schedule. There will be some abdominal pain and bleeding, some forgetfulness and fogginess. Just be there for him, and be patient. He'll be low on appetite, but you just have to make sure he eats. And what about a transplant? [Doctor] At his age, not good. [cheerful acoustic music from radio] That okay? [button clicks] You feel okay? [switch clicks] He's okay but he's acting funny kind. He won't tell me anything. Henry, I think you should come back and see Dad. I know. I know. When you get time off of work, I think you should think about getting a flight home. You think I like being out here with him? [fruit thuds] [bag rustles] [Grace hums melodically] [water swashes] [muffled wind chimes ring] [melancholy piano music] [scribbling] [distant sobbing] [background chatter] [melancholy piano music] [mellow soul music] [balls clack] [balls clack] Keep it. [paper rustles] You stupid or what? [grunting] [Masao] Get off me! [Man] Like throwing money, huh? [clattering] [grunting] [grunting] [thud] [rousing brass music from radio] [Reporter] "Aloha" means both "farewell" and "greetings" and Hawaii bids farewell to 40 years of frustration and failure in attempts to win statehood and joyously greets its new status as a full-fledged member of the Union, its 50th state. It's a fair occasion for the islands. Land of the hula, of sugar cane and pineapple, with its [indistinct] population, brings a colorful culture as it heritage and contribution. Perhaps most important of all, Hawaiian statehood gives the lie to communist charges of American colonialism. Big day was... [water laps] [wood clacks] [Masao hums melodically] [wood clacks] To statehood. [both chuckle] [both sigh] What're you gonna do about your kids, man? They're in town. They're living with their auntie. [Friend] How's that working out? With their mom gone, I figure it's better for them this way, you know? What? Without you there? Yeah, definitely better. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, I'm no dad. No, you ain't. Yeah. I'll just fuck it up. There's more opportunity. It's a new city, this place. What're you gonna do, man? Now that Grace is not here. [Masao sighs] I'm going to drink until I'm very old. And eventually, I'll die. Oh, I like that, brah. [Masao chuckles] [engine revs] It's a lunar eclipse tonight. Hey, wrong way. [car door opens] [switch clicks] [sighs] This guy. Fuck. Idiot. Jesus Christ, Masao. What the fuck? - Hold this. - What is this? Where the fuck are we, man? Fuck. [Masao] My in-laws. [car starts] [dreary music] [muffled wind chimes ring] [birds tweet] [Kati] Dad? You ready? Yeah. [soft traditional music] [balls clack] [balls clack] [balls clack] [balls clack] There you go. Aim it on the ball. [balls clack] Almost. Okay, come on. [Kati chuckles] One more. [balls clack] [chuckles] [balls clack] Hey! You pro! [laughs] Okay. This one? Yeah. Yeah. [porcelain lid scrapes] Take good care of her. Try it again. [banjo plucks] [hums melodically] [banjo plucks] Yeah. Again. [banjo plucks] Nice. Dad? Hm? Do I need to go back? Yeah. Why? That's your home now. This is my home. Not without your mom. Hey, show me again. [banjo plucks] Remember what you're telling your brothers. You went to the movies with Kay and her mom. I know. You said how many times already. Okay. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Dad. [thud] [car starts] [dog barks] Moki? Moki. Moki. Moki. Moki. Moki. Moki! Come on, let's go. Hey, you're gonna get it, you know. [Akiko] Hello? Hi, Akiko. Sorry to bother you. This dog is acting up. [Akiko] Great dress, Kati. [Kati chuckles] [Kati] You think so? It's my mom's from long ago. Thank you. [Akiko] You're welcome. Long time no see. [Kati] Yeah. You should come back and visit your father more often. We try our best. I have a problem, Akiko. Yes. How am I supposed to care for him, when he didn't care for us? Mm. I see. Was there ever a moment when you did love him? When I was a little girl. I looked up to him. I remember the day my mom died. There was a parade to celebrate Hawaii becoming a state. But I was at the hospital. And I was so angry that I was missing out. You didn't miss anything. I know that now. You know, I haven't thought about that day, until now. All these memories coming back. [eerie music] [loud rustling] [wood cracks and pops] [footsteps shuffle] [waves crash] [Grace] Masao. Open your eyes. [crickets chirp] You're just a man. [Masao] I looked after myself good without anybody, so... Dying isn't simple, is it? [eerie music] What? Look at him. What do you see? I know you're not really here. I know you're not really here. I know you're not really here. I know you're not really here. I know you're not really here. I know you're not really here. I know you're not really here. I know you're not really here. I know you're not really here. I know you're not really here. I know you're not really here. [door creaks] I know you're not really here. [Kati] Dad, are you okay? I'm glad you came here, Kati. Thank you. You don't have to stay, you know. [switch clicks] How are your mornings, Mr. Matsuyoshi? Are you numb? Do you feel as if you aren't here? As if you aren't carrying this body? [car approaches] [horn honks] [driver yells] Grandpa. Wake up. How are you feeling? Are you hungry tonight? [Masao mumbles] Are you in pain? How much, one to ten? [Masao] 100,000. [Gavin chuckles] Henry. No, it's Gavin. Gavin? [Gavin] Yeah. Where is, where is Henry? Uncle Henry? He lives on the mainland, Grandpa. [Masao] Oh. That's right. Okay, I see. And Grace? [Gavin] Grandma? [Masao] Where did she go? Grandma died a long time ago. [switch clicks] [door creaks] Mom, I don't know. This place is just... - I don't wanna be here. - Why? What's wrong? Mom, he's like hearing voices or something. I don't know, he keeps talking to people. [Kati] Well, I need your help and he's your grandpa. Yeah. [sighs] Yeah, yeah. - It's only for a little bit. - I know. I know, I know. Okay, I'll try. - Okay, bye. - Right. [sighs] [birds tweet] Coffee. [Masao sighs] Smells good. [Gavin chuckles] And soup. [Masao slurps] [Masao sighs] [Grace hums melodically] [leaves rustle] [water swashes] Masao. Switch. [chuckles] [leaves rustle] [Masao speaks Japanese] Beautiful, isn't it? You've been practicing your Japanese. [Masao speaks Japanese] Yes, everyday. Sounds almost perfect to me. [chuckles] It's so strange. The other night... I had a dream about you. You were speaking Japanese. I couldn't understand you at all. But that's a good omen, I think. [chuckles] [Masao] Oh, what was the dream about? You were an old man. You were dying and... You were afraid. In my dream, no one spoke English. There was Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, but no English. No soldiers. No plantations. It was like heaven. But I was dying. You shouldn't be afraid. We were all with you in the dream. [wind blows] [door creaks] Yeah. You all right? [door closes] [Masao sighs] [knocks] [door squeaks] Okay. Up first. [Masao grunts] Okay. Okay, let's go back. [door squeaks] [toilet flushes] [switch clicks] - Gavin. - Mm? [Masao] What did the bartender say to the horse that walked into the bar? [Gavin chuckles] I don't know. What? "What a long face." [Gavin chuckles] That's funny. [Masao coughs] - Gavin. - Mm? It's funny. I don't feel old. Don't get old, okay? Old age is not for guys like us. [Gavin chuckles] You hear me? I hear you, Grandpa. [Masao] Okay, good.

Are you visiting or... [Gavin] Oh, no, I live in town. - Oh, cool. - Yeah. [Gavin] Just been out here a couple days. What brings you out on this side? You just came out here to come skate the parking lot? [both laugh] No, um... My grandpa lives out here. [Skater] Oh, okay. Cool. He's sick. - So I'm, like- - Oh, I'm sorry. Supposed to watch him. It's okay. [Skater] He must be pretty happy you guys are out here, though. I don't know. [chuckles] We're not that close. Just feels super weird to be there. And... [chuckles] I don't think he ever really liked me, either, so... [Skater] What? Don't say that. - It's all right. - That's probably not true. [Gavin] Just kinda like... Awkward to watch him, though, you know? Have you lived in town your whole life? [Gavin] Yeah. And you never really saw him that much? [Gavin] No, he just stays out here and does his own thing. He never wants to come into town. But you guys can come out here and see him, you know? - Yeah, that's true. - Yeah. [lighter flicks] What about you? You live out here all your life? [Skater] Yeah. Yeah, pretty much my whole life. [chuckles] You don't get bored? No. I like it out here. I mean, I guess it's all I really know. I lived out here the whole time. Yeah. Time moves differently out here. [Skater] Yeah, it's nice. [peaceful piano music] [waves crash] Let's give our children strong names. [Masao] Tiger. Horse. Nobody gives their children such strong names anymore. What is "tiger" in Japanese? [Masao] Tora. Tora. [chuckles] What about Chinese? [Grace] Foo. [Masao] Foo. What is "horse", in Japanese? [Masao] Uma. [Grace] Uma. Sounds a little silly. [chuckles] [waves crash] [singing in foreign language] [peaceful piano music] [waves crash] [crickets chirp] [distant dog barks] What? I have to say bye here. My parents can't see me with you. I'm sorry. [father speaks Japanese] What did I say about the Chinese girl? The whole neighborhood is talking. How? We're just friends, Dad. [father speaks Japanese] [Father] Don't be so stupid, Masao. Doesn't matter. Any day now, we're going back Japan. [Masao] Why? [Father] That's home. [Masao] This is home. [eerie music] [Father] No, it's not. You'll understand. When you're older. The longer we stay, the worse it'll get. [eerie music] Humans are terrible. Violence. And greed. [door slams] [tense music] [white noise swells] [door closes] [fan hums] There is a war coming. [melancholy piano music] Bombs from the sky. Looking back, the 20th century has been such a fast century. The islands have changed so much. You will grow old here. And the countryside will grow old, too. The land will be buried in concrete. And you'll die here, in this home. Our family will take turns caring for you when you're sick. [Masao] So we get to be together? My parents allow it? [Grace] No. You run away from home and you never speak to them again. The community outcasts you. [Masao] I never see them again? Right before the war, they return to Japan without you. Finally... There are fire attacks falling from the sky, and both your parents and siblings will die. There buried in Kamakura. I'm sorry. Well, at least we get to be together. Yes. But after your parents die, you are a different man. Full of anger and rage. Our life is difficult. Here is where I begin to die. While you're out drinking and gambling with your friends. Don't bury me with my parents. Bury me somewhere nearby. Please. I promise. [Grace] Here is where our children will sleep, until you send them away. [Masao] Why would I ever do that? [Grace] Fear. [water drips] [scribbling] Here is where you will take your last breath. Can you see it? [Masao] Yes. You'll never get to name our child Tora, because you'll want them to have American names. Henry. Mark. Kati. Kati will outlive you. Henry will want nothing to do with you. Mark will carry the voices and burdens of our ancestors in his mind. It's okay to be afraid. Can you see? There was once a time where you could see. When you weren't afraid of love. Dying isn't simple, is it? [door creaks] [door creaks] [gentle breeze blows] [birds tweet] [somber string music] Are you numb? Do you feel as if your body is disappearing? As if you are not carrying this body? Am I [indistinct] yet? No. Not yet. [water drips] [leaves rustle] [music intensifies] When you let go of ritual, you can assume the magical. It's what's always made you so special. You see what other people don't. Never lose that. Why would I do that? I don't know. You won't. I think it's done. Finally. Are you okay? Just tired. And everything is in the wrong place. [muffled chatter] The kids. They keep playing. It's nice to think about, isn't it? I'm so glad we never left this place. [Masao] What's going to happen to it? I don't know. Are you disappointed in me? I abandoned all of you. But you all are here for me now. [Grace] Dying isn't simple, is it? Yes, it is. Yes. Masao. Yes, it is. [eerie tones] This is not the end. Now we become everything.
