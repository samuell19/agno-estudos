Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. Candy, you gotta stop messing around with that horny old cop's head. Or we'll be going to school on Wilcox Avenue. What's on Wilcox Avenue? Monica, how long have you been hanging in with us? Oh, about 10 weeks, I guess. Has it been that long? Well, maybe nine weeks. I remember. It was right after we caught her having lunch in Mike Telafaro's gym shorts. And he was in 'em at the time. Well, it was during gym class. Okay, Jan, so what's on Wilcox Avenue anyway? Wilcox Avenue is a street where that poon-tang crazy cop changes into his jock strap. It's also where they lock up the bad guys. It could even happen to us good guys. Don't worry. That flake won't dare bust us. He knows I'll tell the captain about the time I let him pound me with his night stick. Gee, Candy, where was he pounding you? Well, it sure wasn't on my head. Where was he pounding you? Go back to sleep, Bebe. We'll wake you when the train gets to Chicago. You know, that cop really plays with himself in the shower. Can you imagine him getting caught doing it? "Now, looky here, captain. It's my tally-wacker and I'll wash it as fast as I want to." Hey, where the hell are our guys anyway? I hope they don't forget the pup tent. And the beer. Mmm, I sure wish this was a nude beach. Come on, Monica. You just want a chance to check out the meat locker. Yeah, look at the time I save later. No big disappointment. You mean no little disappointment. Speaking of disappointments. We got busted today trying to get a little in the cloakroom. Boy, do we need privacy. Oh, I hate that damn rumble-seat. I'm beginning to feel like the hunchback of Notre Dame. Well, the pizza parlor is out from now on. Pizza? What kind was it? Hot pepperoni. Oh, I love hot pepperoni. Yeah, especially if it belongs to Mike. Come on, let's get wet. Are we really going to take a train to Chicago, 'cause trains make me sick. Come on, Bebe.

Yeah, you should've come in backwards. Now, about those Greeks. Now then, we have been studying the Greeks for about a week and you have all shown little or no interest whatsoever. Therefore, ergo too, you monsters, we're gonna have a spot quiz. These papers contain the questions and when you hear me holler go go go, then and then alone, you may start start start. Don't you dare turn over those papers until I say go. When I say go go go you may start start start. Now, you will have 15 minutes in which to complete the test and I don't want to hear a word and no cheating. Now, after me, in Greek. Boys are beautiful. Girls are monstrous. Boys are... Mr. Flowers. Lord have mercy. Sacre bleu. What is it? I forgot the date today. It doesn't matter. The Greeks did not have clocks anyways. Monster, I'll take those answers please. Oh, my god. It's a raid. I mean it's a fire. I mean it's a drill. I mean it's a fire drill. Everyone, out. Out, everybody out. Out! Everybody, out out. Not you. I've decided to give you an oral. Good evening, good evening. This is Catman Goldstein. The sky, which we are told is located directly above this morning's smog, is reported blue, blowed, and blown. Ha ha ha. All right, if you got a zit on your forehead that is growing into a third eye, do what I do, use Clear-all. Don't let your face be a disgrace. And now let's fill you with this new sound. It's Scott Gale and Company. He may be dull, but at least he's boring. I've had him and even when he's boring he doesn't get too deep. Where's the guys? Football practice. Hey, we need gas. We need oil. We need air. We need a lube job. We need big dick. Right. Big dick? You haven't met him yet, Monica. He's been on vacation. But he's back now. Those gotta be his feet. Hey, is that June East, the old movie star? Hey, she's not old, her movies are. She used to be the hottest thing in Hollywood. Yeah, in more ways than one. They say she buried two dozen husbands. That's big dick? That's funny. Gee, I wonder why they call him Big... Oh, I know. It'll run okay now, Miss East, but I gotta have 146 bucks before I let you take the car. How about taking it out in trade, big boy? I'm really sorry, Miss East. Out of respect for your bosom and all, but I gotta get paid for my time. Looks like she doesn't have the cash to pay her bill. That little turd won't even give her the keys to her car. She's a legend, a living legend. Hey, man. We gotta swing something for her. Wonder what he'd take for those keys. Me. I think I'll drop his face in my cleavage. I think I'm gonna get them high. Make sure you holler if you see our guys coming. I don't want Monica to get caught with her pants down. Miss East? June East? Well it ain't Might Joe Young, honey. Here you are, Miss East. You can take your car now. But I don't understand. That'll little worm, Big Dick, he said it was gonna cost me $146 in cash. You see, Miss East, we're your fan club. And one of our members is opening up what you might call a charge account right now. Yeah, and they're opening up real wide too. You girls don't even know me. But we know your work, Miss East. And Monica sure knows hers. I don't know how to thank you girls, but I sure like your style. Here's my card, honey. Why don't you come down and see my some time, hmm? What's up? Nothing after you get through, honey. Psst, psst. Kevin, I don't believe what I'm seeing. You creep. What do you think I am. Get your hands off me. I don't know what to say. I just don't believe it. Get your hands off her tit. Maybe French is getting to him. Please, Miss Crotch, let me sit somewhere else where I'm safe. Do you think this is some kind of porno class? But I was just try... That's enough, you sex maniac. Class is dismissed. Not you. You stay after class. Now, your punishment is to squeeze 100 times. Commence counting and squeeze. If you stop, I'll murder you. Squeeze. One two three. Where's Jan? I think she's with Kevin. The tit-squeezer Yeah. I wonder if she needs any help. You gotta be kidding. Hey, does anybody got any toilet paper? No, dammit, there's none in here either. I got some here. How do you want it? Over or under? Over easy. And don't you miss. I told you she's with Kevin. Hey, that's the only roll in here too. Now what? You got any folding money? Just a five dollar bill, why?

What bull? Aw, nothing. Where the hell is that waiter? He's probably stirring your tomato sauce with a fly-swatter. Hey, Fenz is gonna eat. So, let's all cool it. Sorry, Fenz. Hey, Waiter. Hey, you know who I am? I'm the Fenz. None of this winky fucking crap. Just take their order. Hey, man. We don't talk that way around here. Hey, we got a problem outside. What kind of problem?

Hey, we don't use that kind of language in here. Ohhh. Officer Archie, we have a 501 at the Pizza Plus. See if you can get there this time without getting lost. Officer Archie, just where the hell are you? Archie, this is the captain. Call in right now. Shh, keep your voices down. I never wanna eat another meatball the rest of my life. That goddamn fag. I think he tried to rape me with a pepperoni. He did? Gee, I love hot pepperoni. We know already. We know. Shh, keep your voices down. If my folks catch us out here, I'll be murdered. Geez, Monica, would you folks really murder you? Screw off, Mike. Go sit on a banana. I'd like to get my hands on that cook. I'll flatten him, like one of his pizzas. I couldn't move. That creepy waiter kept trying to hold me by my tits. Ha ha, he thought I was one of his turkeys. He kept stuffing meatballs up my ass. The waitress kept pouring gravy on my tits and then she'd lick it off. Oh yeah, I was trying to do the same thing. She kept pushing me away. Hey, let's dry off, get in the van, and split to Mulholland. Yeah. We deserve it. We'll have to ride nude. Give me a towel. Awww. Hey, hey, come on. I'm only gonna bury the Fenz a little bit. Ouch, damnit, Fenzie, you're missing the right thing. Somebody has their bony ass knee in my ear. Is that your ear? Yes. Well, for your information, mama, that bone is not my knee. Oh shit, Sam. Get that thing down here where it belongs. Where the hell is that? Fenzie, is this you? Hell no. Don't you know the difference in size? This is Buzz. If that's Buzz, then who the hell are you? Oh, I thought you were Bebe. We'll I'm friggin' not. Couldn't you tell by the ass rotation. Damn it, Jan. Move around a little. Hey, cool it will ya, Fenz. You're going all on me, man. You're like a bunch of animals. This shit has got to cease. There's just got to be better accommodations. I give up. My wacker's been everywhere but where it belongs. I can't get up. Put your pants back on, Monica. I never got them off. Christ, Sam, that's mine you're playing with. Mike, was that you? Hell no. I said mine won't get up. Oh hell, I'm gonna put this baby outta here. I know we don't have any privacy. Half the time in that damn van, I don't know who I'm screwing. I'm tired of rumble seats, the doorway, and grease-rats... And locker rooms and pay toilets and phone booths. And swimming pools and pup tents and bowling alleys. Bowling alleys? Yeah, haven't you ever? I don't think I wanna. You haven't lived. When those pins start pounding your bare... They won't pound me between mine. Where are we going in such a hurry? Just relax. Slow down. Turn in here. Hey, this looks spooky. Will you stop being flaky? Well, this is a little creepy. What happens if we meet something coming down? You drive over it. I hope it's smaller than us. I think we should throw this taxi in reverse. Oh, will you two cool it? This dump hasn't been manicured in 100 years. Looks like a friggin' jungle. Don't breathe too hard. You might knock it over. Who lives here anyway? The jolly green giant? I've never climbed so many fucking steps in my whole life. Will you stop whining, Monica? That ass of yours could shed some fat. Well, Sam just happens to like fat asses. Come to think of it, I do too. Will you two cool it? Oh, I can see Vincent Price coming down the stairs now. Where, where? Cool it, you dizzy. Come on. Let's check this mausoleum out. Look at all this junk. That junk is probably worth a fortune. Oh, Jan. I'm not taking another step till you tell us whose pad this is. Who else? June East. Didn't she tell us to "come down and see me sometime?" Hello, anybody home? Hello? Hello? Hello? Anybody home? I guess there's nobody home. Come on, let's check out the place. What for? I've got my reasons. But what if somebody catches us. We were invited, you know? Candy, you and Monica check downstairs. I'll check out around here. And, Bebe, you check out the upstairs. What are we checking for? I wanna know how many bedrooms there are in this house. I don't wanna go up there all by myself. Come on, get going. Well? I didn't wanna come in here anyway. I don't know why I have to go up here by myself anyway. This place gives me the creeps. Oh my god. Oh, I can't stand any more. Oh, oh. I think June East and a lion are making it. All right, who's down there? It's us, Miss East. And who the hell is us? We're the girls that helped you get your car back from Big Dick Oh, that us. I'll be right down. Ya'll scared my little kitty to death. This sure is a marvelous old house you have here, Miss East. Yes, now cut that Miss East and call me June. That Miss crap makes me feel ancient. Say, baby, get me some more champagne, will you? Sure, June. How many rooms do you have in this house? Hell, I don't know. And you live here all alone. Just me and the memories of all my boys. Did you ever think of coaching aspiring, young actresses, like ourselves? No, but I've coached a few young men in my day. Thanks, honey. I'd offer you some, but the stuff is too goddamn expensive to piss away. Now, what the hell are you all doing here anyway? Yeah, what the hell are we doing here? Frankly, June, it would be an asset to you and us if you would coach us in acting. Our parents would be willing to fork out good money for us to be coached by such a great star. Oh, I love champagne best. Acting classes, huh? Tell me, honey, are there gonna be any young boys that need instruction? Oh, yes, lots and lots of boys. Lots and lots of boys. I mean any real big boys? Oh, plenty. Oh, plenty. Big, really big. Big really big. What have you got here, some kind of goddamn parrot in drag? Anyways, sweetheart, I don't feel like coaching just yet. Well, maybe this big. You've got a deal. All right. On one condition. Oh, here it comes. The boys get their lessons first.

Come on, Buzzy, honey. Ahhh. You sure he'll still go along? No, go along-y, no get Candy. Oh, I like it already. Along? Along? What' this along? Well, there's just one little hitch. You see, Fenz. I told you. Always a hitch. I knew it, man. It's just a lot of bullshit. Oh, Sam, sometimes I just wanna sit on your face and suffocate you. I'm ready, I'm ready. Can Jan continue? Give me another beer. Well, she's just a little boy-crazy. Like just how much is a little? Well, you know. No, I don't know. Like screwing-crazy. What the hell's wrong with that? Well, she's a little older than we are. Who is this chick anyway? June East. June East? Who the hell is June East? June East, June East. Hey, she's that silent movie star. Silent movies? She must be 100. I can't agree to that. Well, why the hell not? My bullets are special and I'm very particular who I shoot them with. Gee, Fenzie, do you really shoot people? Bebe, sit on your brains for a minute. This rumble seat, van, pup tent garbage has got to cease. Your bullets can rust for all I care. Yeah, but what about our pride? Yeah, it would be like doing it with you grandmother. There is no way this can be done. The Fenz has spoken. Everyone in the tent. Watch out, watch out. Come on. I don't wanna be last. Oh my god, somebody's foot. So, this is Fenzie. Oh, I head such stories about you. Hey, the Fenz has heard a few about you too, Juney baby and... Uh, the boys are all in accord with your desires, Miss East. I thought we had this Miss East crap settled. Oh, I'm sorry June. It's just that your age. Age? What age? She's just a baby. Hey, who's muscles here? This is Rocky. He's got muscles that talk. Oooh. Hmm, I wouldn't mind having his muscles say something to me. Hey. Cool it. Which muscle talks best? The one I personally exercise for him. Which one is that? Aw, geez, Bebe. Can't you see it's the one on his arm? Yeah, the arm between his legs. Ya'll look, but don't touch unless I say so. See? Oh, he's a little ticklish in spots, so you have to be careful where you grab him. I'd like to grab him by his short-hairs. What's the matter with you chicks? Ain't you never seen muscles before? Which one of you gonna be the first volunteers for my acting class? I will, I will. Cram it, will you, Bebe? The boys are first. What do you say, honey? Like to learn to lick, I mean like to learn to act? Is that all we're gonna do? Act? Hell no, we're going to learn to live the part, love the part, play with the part. Hey, this won't take long. Won't take long? He's been up these almost an hour. Man, I couldn't tell if those screams were his or hers. Hey, look. The door's opening. Hey. I think she creamed him. Oh, poor poor Fenzie. Wow, Fenz creamed. What the hell is he talking about? Hey, Fenz, your legs won't stop shaking. Man, what has this chick got? Fantastic. He looks dehydrated. I wanna talk to the guys. We can' hear you, Fenzie. I said I wanted talk to the guys alone. Chicks, split. Three to one, huh? Well, now the odds are getting a little bit more even. I don't believe it. The one weekend my folks are out of town, we've got the whole damn house to ourselves. Including the bedroom. Including the bedroom. And we've got four limp worn out Johns. Mike told me her tongue was like a Roto-Rooter job. You're lucky. All Buzz keeps doing is farting. Hell, Fenzie just keeps murmuring, "No more beets, no more beets." What are we gonna do? Any more of this and I'll be ready to take on one of you. A few more days of this bullshit and you got a partner. Days, hell, I can't wait much longer. Already beginning to feel like a leftover, since this June chick came into their act. Come on, let's see if we can rouse these jerks. Yeah. Hey. Come on, baby. But, Fenzie. You got your reputation to think about. Aw, bullshit. I got my goodies to think about, man. Buzzy likey kissy kissy kissy? Buzzy likey sleepy. Sleepy sleepy. Mike, your mom called. She thinks I have you on some new kind of pot or something. Bebe, I want you to will my body to UCLA medical. Come on, Sammy, honey. Just one more time for old Monica, huh? Is it my turn again? No more swinging from those rafters for me, man. It's your turn. The hell with this. Let's cool off. Maybe it's Charles Bronson. If it is, ask him if his tally-wacker would like some poon-tang. Hello? Well, hello, hot-shot. How are the boys? What boys? We buried them this morning. Oh, my little darlings all worn out? Isn't it more like flaked out? Well, I was a little rough, but then that's what young boys are for. Well, we all decided that we don't want your acting lessons anymore. Well, baby, don't fret your silly little head. I just called to tell you I don't need your boys. You don't? Because I have found the greatest lover of all time. The greatest lover of all time. Oh, I can't stand any more. Oh, you've got to let me rest. Oh. Oh my god, what a thing. Whose thing? Why his thing, of course. Buongiorno, class. Buongiorno. This. Is. The.
