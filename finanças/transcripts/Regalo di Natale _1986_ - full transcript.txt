It's impressive It's a beautiful villa When we played, we didn't need such scenery That's why we lost If your friend returned, she'd kick us out She's in the mountains with her husband She left the maid Adriana! What do you think? Do you think we can corner him? I think so The fireplace is lit Here I am Put the things on the trays and the bottle in the refrigerator What did madam tell you? That you'd be coming with friends and that you shouldn't go upstairs Have that man come down - Is it him? - Yes... Let's awake him up - Sir... - He was awake a little whills ago I fell asleep... My friend Stefano has a lovely villa I don't know whether to sell it It would be a shame I tried to seduce the maid ...but no luck Maids were more willing once It's true... There's the bathroom You'll feel better if you freshen up ...I've got to be in shape tonight We can't lose on Christmas Eve When is the "champion" getting here? You're in shape: Money does wonders We got far Not Stefano... he has a gym Being with women from morning to night - has changed him - Changed? He has changed He's gay! He's gay? - A little... Little or lots, he's gay! He dates a married woman... a coverup Who is the other player? Stefano knows him He's an industrialist who enjoys losing He lost $100,000 lire recently You can go when you've finished For you... You should hear the things that man told me! He's a pig! - And the potatoes? - They're cooked... Before going, I'll decorate the tree I'ts a tradition You hit it rich, huh? A cinema makes a lots of money I always told you to leave here Maybe now you can give us a hand ...in changing our lives So Stefano called to invite you What guarantees do we have? You're a champion and he's a fool That's not enough I thought about that... To our friendship! In other words, you caught a fool who likes to be swindled? It took a lot of work Stefano borrowed the house and pretends to be a rich man willing to lose But "he" could have done the same! Hello... Yes, thank you Madam... it's me How much at the wicket? That's not much How are the other theatres going? I'll call you later Problems? Your colleagues killed my film It isn't commercial... not making anything It will take time to be appreciated How is it going at the paper? They make me review trash The boss covers the good films I finished writing my book on John Ford but I don't have a publisher If only things went well tonight... Stefano got the house, huh? - Yes, but... - But what? Stefano and I aren't enough to corner that guy I've never been great at a card table Well? Now you'll get furious Speak! That industrialist... Ugo found him What?! Ugo got him Maybe we're romantic shitheads... ...but it's a chance for you and Ugo ...to make peace That's absurd! Ugo is not doing well in that private TV station He sells second rate stuff for little money This "coup" would be important for him He needs help more than we do What can I say? That'I'll play to save him from drowning in shit?! That's how I thought you'd react We would have liked you two to make peace You're an imbecile, they're using you Maybe you can write, but know nothing about life Don't say they used me It would have been great to sit at a card table again You're an imbecile We thought that by coming back... I'm leaving... It's Franco... am I interrupting? Were you having dinner? I'll be in Rome tomorrow morning to solve the problem I'd rather discuss it personally The film isn't doing well I've always paid you in the past Will you help me or not? Tell me frankly and save me a trip I understood perfectly... Okay... "with just a phone reservation..." Ugo, there's a problem What? Lele... He's not coming... - he got furios - Why? - It's easy to guess - Explain... I had to tell him - What? - That's you'd be there You're an idiot You ruined everything He would have discovered it when he came But I would have convinced him to play I don't think so ...he hates you... - I could have convinced him ...I'm sure... I would have pleaded on my knees What shall we do? - We'll play - Without Franco?! If he raises the bid, we're sunk - What a mess - For a month... I put up with him, listening to his stories about women and poetry - Do you need a loan? - This "coup" could have changed my life What are you doing there? Lele is here We were looking at the Christmas tree It's cold... Lele is a script writer - And the other one? - He's here but... There are a few problems - Isn't he coming? - In fact... The appointment ...was set 15 days ago I left my father alone ...to be here... I wouldn't want to have been made a fool of - So are we... - We what? We're sorry... - Are we playing? - Franco! Did you really think I wasn't coming?! Hey, aren't you saying hello? Hi... - You've gotten fat, huh? - You haven't Mr. Santelia - Are you a "pro"? - I like to play... ...as a distraction from my work ...and to learn from champions I haven't touched a deck of cards in 5 years If my wife knew, she'd kill me Did you get re-married? Yes. Is there a phone here? It's in the kitchen... How could you have called Ugo? Without Ugo we can't corner him Ugo would sell his own children! Trust me. He's loaded His visiting card. Call and find out - Why did you call me? - You're the only one - that can beat him - You want to get me in trouble? Do you trust my word? Why should I? We've been waiting forever for a guy like him ...and wanted to share him with you You and Ugo must make peace He's getting suspicious Aren't you calling? I was waiting for this occasion I wanted to write but was ashamed I can't tell you what I wanted to tell you ...I had memorized everything ...but now... Everything that happened is bullshit I feel like I have nothing ...to do with it ...that it's about someone else I finished with you 10 years ago - For an idiocy? - Exactly! If you had let me speak, you would have understood What? I didn't tell you a lot of things You blabbered about her and me all over town! ...it's the truth... I wanted to pay you back, but you were already ruined ...so I let it pass I'm not in that condition now A friend of mine... ...wall-papered my house with cecks that bounced! They swindled me but I'm getting on my feet They swindled you?! - I'm on my feet - What do you want? That you'd be my friend again Why?
