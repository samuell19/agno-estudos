You already have one! Hand it over! It's mine! Let go! - No, you let go! I want it. - So do I! Let go! You're so annoying. - Give it to me! I want it! - I had it first! Okay, listen up. - I want it! Guys! - You already have one! Guys! Our adventure might be coming to an end, but I think we learned a lot from Quick Fix. Are those two iPhones for Tremblay? No, I'm not giving them to Tremblay. What about Desmarais' lawn mower? No. So, as I was saying, like Joseph-Armand Bombardier used to say… I'll be back for the mower. My hockey bag's full. I'm taking the toaster. QUICK FIX Well, bye. Good luck in the country. Thanks. You said I could keep the cell phone! - You're so annoying! Take it! You can spend more time with your cousin Charles… The one who can't count to ten? You could open a business. Hear that, Joseph-Armand? A business in the country! The country's full of opportunity! No, it's not. And you know why? Because there's nothing to do in the country! You'll come up with something, you always do. Like when you hired the brainiacs to do everyone else's homework. That was good. Jacynthe found us a nice house and Denis will give me work. We'll get back on our feet. From now on, I am managing our finances. The government shouldn't be allowed to freeze bank accounts. You owed $20,000! - I was going to pay. I had a plan. Yeah, a plan to ruin my life. COCO FARM I'm reading an excellent book on narrative structure. The protagonist - the hero of the story - arrives at a crossroads before setting on his journey. It acts as a wakeup call the protagonist isn't expecting, forcing him to embark on his new adventure. Now initially, the hero balks at the prospect of this new adventure. Oh, boy… But what the protagonist doesn't realize, is that this new adventure will transform him. And that's the whole point of a good story. The transformation of the protagonist. The protagonist isn't too happy right now. Charles! Hey! - Hello! How was the drive? - Not bad. Max! Astronaut? You're writing a new novel? I'm still in the research stage. I'm so happy! I could barely sleep. Right… Right. He's so happy. - Oh yeah? It's been a while. - It sure has. Okay , that's enough, Charles. You'll be comfortable here. It doesn't look like much, but… Cute, isn't it? Yes, it's… perfect. We picked up some groceries… No, no! That's not for you! Look! There's a yard. I thought of a bunch of things we can do together. Shoot tin cans, catch frogs… take apart a ski-doo! We still have to unpack. And I'm a little tired. I get it… Tomorrow, then? Yeah, sure. Tomorrow. - Max? The protagonist should go shoot tin cans. No. The protagonist doesn't feel like shooting tin cans. Charles! Come on, sweetie! I gotta go! I'll be home if you change your mind. I'm taking one for the road… since the box is open. It'll get stale otherwise. Bye! - Bye. All this needs is a coat of paint, right? Hey, Maurice! How's it going? - Hi there, Alice. Hey, Lou. - Hi. A feeder, a sprayer and bird seed. That'll be $37.78. Put it on Dad's account. I'm sorry, can't do that. Then what's the point of having an account? Your father has to pay. He's maxed out his credit. For now on, you have to pay up front. I could post an ad on my YouTube channel. "Garden tools supplied by FG Edwards!" I can lend you the money. Who are you? Max… ence. Maxence. You can call me Max. I call myself Max. How much do you need? - $37.78. I got it. Can I get some help? I'll pay you back, okay? Sure. - Alice! Coming. Will that be all? Yeah. She has a YouTube channel? "She Grows." I hear it's very popular. If you have an old wardrobe or a drawer lying around… you can make a garden. And with a garden, you can grow your own food. The idea is to use things you already have. It's so easy, anyone can do it! Look, for example… Look, for example… Look, for example… Well! What kind of business are we opening? No business. Oh, come on! An entrepreneur needs a business. I'm not starting a gardening business. I shouldn't even listen to you. You don't exist! You're listening because you still need me… You know… I was in the country when I came up with the concept for my first snowmobile. Inspiration can strike anywhere. You need to get out. Look around. If you talk to people, you'll find out what their needs are. I don't know anything about business. But you know the area. You can help me find an idea. Adèle! Justin! Come and eat! That's enough strawberries. Gimme that! That's mine! Give it back! - No! Charles? Give this to your sister. The first step to starting a business is identifying a need. Joseph-Armand Bombardier always said, "Necessity is the mother of all invention." Joseph-Armand Bombardier… Doesn't he play for the Canadiens? Come on, Justin! By the time I get the iPad, it's always dead! That's not my fault! Charles, go change the baby's diaper. Changing diapers… There's a need right there. That's exactly what Joseph-Armand Bombardier used to say. "Behind every need lies an opportunity." And here's a good opportunity to eat your breakfast. Hey, that's mine! - Thanks, Auntie. He's eating my food! - You don't like cretons. Donny! Charles! - What? I mean Justin! Stop messing with her and give her the food back. Hey! - Hey! That's enough! Adele Laframboise, you can leave the table. He started it! Wow! These eggs are so good! Fresh from our chickens! Charles? Give me a hand. Watch out, it's smelly! Thanks! Three bowls each? Really? I was hungry! Hey! - Hey! Armande, come here! What are you doing in here? Go on! It has to be easy to produce. That way, we keep production costs down. And hit a better profit margin. I don't understand a word of what you just said. Can you pass me a wipe? A wipe, please. Thanks. You'll be nice and clean! Just like an egg! Hey! The wipes! Come here, girl. What's wrong with you? Never seen a chicken before? They just laid their eggs? They're chickens. That's what they do. Why are your eggs better than regular eggs? Those eggs are produced in big chicken factories, like Boivin's. Thousands of chickens, all squished together. They don't have any room to breathe. They've never been outside, and they're shot up with hormones. And the eggs are refrigerated for months before you eat them. Our chickens are happy and healthy, right, Armande? Don't you ever eat? How many eggs do they lay a week? One a day. - One a day? So if we had 500 chickens, they'd lay 500 eggs a day? That makes… 3,500 eggs a week. Divided by 12, that's 300 dozen a week. That's 15,000 dozen a year! How'd you do that? Want a lemonade refill, chickies? Thanks, Mado. How much for a dozen eggs? It depends. - On what? Regular ones are $5. Free-range organic can cost up to $7. Thanks, Mado. - You're welcome, young man. $100,000 a year! Did you just make those numbers up? You can't have 500 chickens. There's a limit of 99 per owner. A limit? Who decided that? The Federation. The Federation? Who are they to say how many chickens we can have? It's to protect the big farms that control the market. You can't start a business with 99 chickens. I know. That's why nobody does it. But what if I order 99 for me and 99 for Charles? And 99 for me. You're starting an egg laying business? Yeah, nothing too big. A little farm… ette. A little farmette. I'll take all this, plus a 99 chicken order. So, 297 chickens, payable upon delivery… $15 a hen, times 297… That'll be 4,455 bucks. $4,500?! Is there a problem? Uh, no problem. Zero problem. Here's your $40. You're gonna need it. …unscrew the nuts, grease the metal, screw the bolts back in… It's extremely meticulous work. And as I was cleaning my 8th tractor… I saw a hot air balloon and decided to hop in. The wind was so strong I ended up in the Magdalen Islands… where I had lobster with a homesick fisherman… who looked oddly like a trout. Cool. Maxence! - What? Dinner is our time together to talk about our day, to chat about… I found a business. Okay… what is it? I'm not telling. You'll only discourage me. I always encourage you! No. Mom encouraged me. Every time I have an idea, you list the reasons it won't work. That's not true. I fully support your entrepreneurial spirit. It's just that sometimes you think too big. Okay. I might be more… Scared? - …cautious than Mom was. Alright, shoot. What's your idea? I'm starting an egg farm with Charles. I ordered 300 chickens this morning. Soon we'll have 500 and make $100,000 a year. Good. Ambitious, but… good. That's it? Very, very good. Anything you want to add? Any advice? No, that's… great news. We'll have free eggs. See? You can be encouraging! To be honest I thought you'd… - Are you crazy? That's what I thought. - Come on, Maxence! 500 chickens? I'll be in my office. - Where will you find the money? Who'll take care of 500 chickens? Where will you put 500 chickens?! Can I at least take off the jacket? - No. What's the plan again? $15 a hen. We can buy organic grain at $20 a bag. We'll need 10 bags a week, so $8,000 to launch our business. At $7 a dozen, we'll be profitable by week two. I can't remember all of that. You don't have to. Just talk about how happy our chickens will be and how you'll take good care of them, because you'll be… Staff manager? I'm sorry. No. Okay, thanks anyway. What do you mean, "no"? We're only asking for a $8,000 loan. We call it a "loan," but it isn't really a loan. Look, the bank wants to make money. So we fund you, and you pay us monthly interest. The bigger the loan, the more money we make. $8,000 isn't enough to be profitable for the bank. That's good to hear, because we actually need a lot more! But there's another problem: venture capital management. The bank won't take risks. To take out a loan, you need capital. Let me explain. I need collateral from you. So if you don't pay, the bank takes the collateral as payment. But you two don't have any capital. You don't have anything. Well, thanks anyway. And you say you support entrepreneurs? Where'd you hear that? - Right there. PROUD PARTNER OF QUEBEC ENTREPRENEURS Oh, that's from our Montreal office. Out here, we don't support much. No, no. No way! Why not? Your dad has a big tractor business. He's got tons of money. Because. - Because what? He'll say things I don't understand and make me feel like an idiot. My dad's not like your dad. Yeah, yours can count. Imagine how proud he'll be that his son's starting a business. A real business. 500 chickens? Sorry, it's not funny. What's so funny about my business plan? It's not a bad plan. But… There are some holes in it. Charles, are you listening? If you wanna start a business, you need to learn the basics. Maurice said he could sell you 300 chickens, so that's where you start. You'll only need to raise 5,000 bucks to start. You shouldn't ask one person to invest 5,000 bucks. If you ask me to provide full funding for your business, then it won't be yours anymore. It'll be mine. Instead, you'll sell shares. The company will issue shares at $150 each. I'll lend you the first $300. Thanks, but we still need $4,700. Exactly. So you go and find yourselves 47 other shareholders. At $100 each! - Bingo. B-11. Put your teeth in! They hurt! I know, but we don't understand a word. N-38. Bingo! Oh! Germain has bingo. Okay! Now put on a smile… Alright, everyone. And let me do the talking. Let's take a break. These boys want to talk to you. Boys? Speak into the mic. Good evening. Good evening. My cousin and I are starting a business. There aren't many of you here, but would anyone be willing to help fund our project? Thank you so much! You won't be disappointed. What's the name? - Germain Gingras. Germain Gingras. Got it. We sold one share. That won't get us very far. What's the date? - July 1st. I got an idea. Excuse me! Excuse me! Hi, there. Hi. Me and my cousin from Montreal are starting a business. We're going to have 300 very happy hens. They'll be free-range, organic grain-fed, and well-loved… And we'll produce the best eggs you've ever tasted. But we need your help. My mom always says it takes a village to raise a child. Because, well, she's got five of us. And so it takes a village to open a business, too. Coco Farm will be a local business. Something we'll build together. I know many of you lost your jobs when the factory closed, and you don't have much money. We don't need much to get started. With just a small hundred, you can become a Coco Farm shareholder! So not only will you be part of a local business… you'll help us achieve our dream. I'll buy a share! One share of Coco Farm right here! Yes, Martin! My cousin Max will take your names. I'll take some too! - I want two! Coco Farm? It just came to me! I don't know what I was thinking… We can start the farm! Hey, Beer Belly. Hello, hello! Everything okay? - Sure, yeah. What about you? - Yeah… Look, uh… I was wondering… Think you'll need employees? 'Cause ever since I closed my butcher shop… Well… you know… Ginette and I have lots of free time. Ginette? - My truck. So we're… available. Well? Okay, a little higher… That's good! Tie it up. There you go! Hello! Here's your 300. Too many! - You can do it. It's heavy. - Thanks. Look at this. - Watch out, girls! In! In! In! Get in there, come on! Easy, Ginette. Easy. You're fine. Be right back. - Go! Go! We do stock local products. Vegetables, sure, but not eggs. Why not? Eggs, meat, cheese, milk… No animal products. Who decides that? - The Federation. For real? I have 300 chickens, and you're saying I can't sell my eggs in the town's only grocery store? Look, kid, you're not alone. There's a ton of local producers out there making great products. I'd like to help, but I'm not allowed. Then where do I sell them? At your farm or at little farmers markets… Mathilde… come here, girl! Please, ladies… I know, but a corner store isn't technically a grocery store. I know, I know. The Federation. Yeah, fine. Thanks. I need help with Beer Belly. To the right! Okay. Hang on. Almost there. Come on! Come on, Beer Belly. You can do it! Careful! Careful! Careful! Come on, old man. That doesn't look comfortable. Yeah… - Okay, up! Would you mind getting him off me? Sure. I don't know how I'll manage 300 chickens. They're crazy animals! I went to every market and corner store and nobody can sell our eggs. What are we going to do? I don't know. Well… It isn't the start we'd hoped for. It was a stupid idea. Why was it stupid? I'll never make money with this business. Is that why you started Coco Farm? I don't know. I don't want to end up like my dad. Money's nice, but it's not the only reason to start a business. I didn't build the first snowmobile to get rich. Then why did you? My son Yvon… He was only two when he died. It was a rough winter… and he got sick. He needed a hospital… but back then, country roads weren't plowed. He died in my arms. That's why I invented the snowmobile. For Yvon. Before my mom died… she said that one day I'd be a great businessman. Then you'll have to prove her right. Beer Belly! Beer Belly! Beer Belly! Wh-what is it? What's going on? You had a butcher shop, right? Yes? Then you have experience. Don't tell me you want to get rid of the hens. No, of course not! What I mean is, you have business experience. So you are going to drink your coffee and help me organize our business. I found seven farmers markets if we go as far as Mansonville. And we'll be lucky to sell 50 dozen. Yeah. Okay, Max. Look. Why don't we put up a… a big Coco Farm sign on the road side, with flashing lights, like for strip… I mean bingo. No, we're not putting up a big sign with lights. We don't even have lights. - No, I know… No, you're right, it's a bad idea. But… when I had my butcher shop… I ran a lot of special offers. People like free stuff. You know, you open a box and… Oh, there's a free t-shirt! See? We're not giving away t-shirts. We don't even have any. You don't have a brand. Have you been here long? Long enough. You have a branding problem. Your brand sucks. Actually, you just don't have one. She's right, you know… It's true, we don't have one. What's a brand? Well, we don't have one. My God, you smell like shit. Duh. Because 300 chickens make a lot shit. And it's impossible to get rid of it! I smell like chicken shit! And I'm finding feathers in my hair, in my clothes…. even in my mouth and underwear! Alice wanted to talk to us. Where are we? At La Cueillette, duh. Thanks, Lou. How do you feel when I say, "Let's go to La Cueillette"? Well, happy. Why do you feel happy, Charles? Because I'm hungry? Here, chickies. I made cookies! Thanks, Mado! - Oh, thanks! Because you know it's like being at your grandma's. Exactly. Nowadays, people don't buy a product. They buy an idea. Mado doesn't sell food, she sells comfort. Plus, we all know her story. She raised four kids by herself, and they all ran off to the city. So now she mothers the whole village. We don't know Coco Farm yet. There's no brand. - No story. I'm not following. Take Charles, for instance. He's a story. I'm a story? Sure! Shy, lack of self-confidence… He doesn't have many friends, so the chickens are his friends. That's not true. I have some friends. So, an egg from Coco Farm tastes better than any other because the chicken that laid it is happy, healthy, and loved. Coco Farm isn't about eggs. It's about eating food from animals that are loved. And THAT's a brand. People will come from all over! I gotta talk to you. What are you proposing? I'll take over the branding. Logo creation, social media content, in exchange for 25% of the profits. And we'll offer Lou a summer job so she stops following me. I really need to talk to you. We have 50 shareholders. Me and Charles only get 50% of the profits. Then I'll do it for 15%. I need to talk to you! You're not actually considering this? She's right, Charles. We don't know that! She's not even making sense. We have to be on social media. I'm not an actor. I can't be in "stories". Then you'll learn! If we can't get our eggs on shelves, we need people to come to us. Here's our new logo. Lou's painting it. Stay in the lines! - Don't worry. And Ginette is getting a makeover! - She's very happy. And my dad came to help us out. He works fast. What's going on? I've had six people claim they gave you $100 to "start your business." They didn't "give" me $100… You can't borrow money from strangers, Max! I didn't borrow it, they invested! - They gave you money! You don't know anything about business! Hey! I'm talking to you! I might not know about business, but I know about life. And I can tell you those people will want their money back! I want the names of everyone who gave you money. because we are reimbursing them tomorrow. No, we're not. Because pretty soon, everyone who invested in Coco Farm is going to be glad they invested in my business, because their shares will be worth way more… Whoa, whoa, whoa! When you say "everyone", how many "everyones" are we talking about, exactly? Max… you borrowed $100 from how many "everyones"? 50 people. You borrowed $100 from 50 people! This isn't happening… We left Montreal because we were in debt… We left Montreal because you were in debt. We were in debt. Because I didn't spend that money on myself. I spent it to support us both. You really have to be more sensitive to others. At your age, this was past my bedtime. Not drinking beer? No, no, it's herbal tea. Big day tomorrow. We're going to Mansonville. You know… I can't pay you. I don't need money. Then why are you helping us? Pride. Pride, my boy. At the end of the day, money… But… knowing that you're part of something… that's what matters. You know, Max… I wasn't always there for my own kids. Too busy with my business. And one day, they opened a Walmart. People realized it was cheaper to buy meat there. So… One morning, I woke up… and my butcher shop was gone. So were my kids. So it feels good to be around you guys. It's almost as if… I'm getting a second chance. Get some sleep. I need you well rested tomorrow. We'll take a dozen. - Thank you! Look! Coco Farm! The farm from the video you showed me yesterday, with that cute kid and his chickens! Thank you. - It's Beer Belly! Hello! - Hello. May I? - Sure, help yourself. Thanks. Oh, am I in it? Hello! Grab a dozen for Marc. Let's get four to hand out at the office. Three more? - Yes. $28, please. Charles isn't here? - No, he stayed with the hens. Staff management! $28, please. Thanks. Your branding's really great! - Thank you, it's all them. You can keep the change. - Oh, thanks! Have a nice day! Have a nice day! Social media really works! Hey there, little friend! Stick to herbal tea, Raymond. It's better for you. What? So now I'm Raymond? What happened to Beer Belly? I think Raymond suits you. Raymond's doing good… And I need him. Got it. Got it! Come on, Ginette. There we go! What do you want, Boivin? - A dozen eggs. Not enough at your grandpa's factory? Big producers like us like encouraging small businesses. Yeah right. Just admit it: our eggs are better than yours. Go on, get inside! This is crazy! Come on! Please! What's going on? What's going on is people from the city were here all day to take pictures with Charles, but Charles wasn't here! I spent the entire day chasing down chickens who'd ran off into the street! Where's Charles? Summer school! Summer school? Tell them the tractor will be ready tomorrow. The parts came in this morning. Yeah, thanks. Okay, good. Hey, I gotta run. Okay, bye. I need Charles. He has to pass his math. He has to run our business. You don't need him to run your business. You know why I set up shop here, Max? Because I saw a business opportunity. Lots of farmers, with a lot of land… but not a lot of machinery. You and me, we're entrepreneurs. And we'll always find new opportunities. Charles… isn't like us. He's gonna have to work harder if he wants to succeed. People came from Montreal to see the farm. They drove an hour to get here. You know what they wanted? Charles. They wanted pictures with Charles and his chickens. He might be bad with numbers, but he's good at lots of other stuff. I'll help him with math, but he's coming back to the farm tomorrow morning. I need him. One more thing, Coco Farm isn't my business, Denis. It's our business. "Megan has two $50 bills and four $20 bills to buy new clothes. Is that enough to buy a skirt for $35.95, jeans for $56.79, and a shirt for $27.59?" I don't understand it… You've hardly eaten, chickies. I'm not hungry. - You need to keep your strength up. So… two $50 bills. 50 plus 50. Go! If it isn't the little entrepreneurs! Boivin… As in Boivin Agriculture Inc. You've got a cute little farmette. Coco Farm? My granddaughter showed me on social media. You've got lots of followers! Followers are nice, but they don't pay shareholders. But… You can't possibly survive on 300 chickens. What's your business plan? - We're working on it. We've been in the poultry business for 30 years. Eggs are our specialty. I've got 25,000 chickens. Over the years, we've seen lots of little farms pop up. But they all end up realizing that… the numbers don't add up. Got any advice? Considering your extensive experience. You gotta understand that… if you want to survive in the farming business… you have to reach the masses. And the masses, they aren't here. When you're done messing around, give me a call. I'll buy your chickens, so you won't lose everything. Bye-bye, boys. Jackass. He's not touching my chickens. "The masses aren't here." Not again… Listen up! It's no secret that business isn't great. In Mansonville, we sold 50 dozen and made $350. But it cost us $150 in gas. - Yeah… Ginette's a guzzler. And our fans came here to take pictures with the hens… but we still only sold 50 dozen. Even a hundred dozen a week won't make us rich. But when Raymond and I were in Mansonville, I realised something. Most of our clients aren't farmers. They're city folk with country houses. What's our follower count at? - 60,000. 60,000 people… Where are those 60,000 people? In the city. - Exactly! They're following us because for them, a bunch of kids running an egg farm is cool. They don't have fresh eggs from happy chickens! So tomorrow morning, we're packing up and heading to Montreal's biggest market. 2.5 million visitors a year… We're going to… Jean-Talon Market! I already booked a stall. Jean-Talon Market! I'll get Ginette loaded. HAPPY SATURDAY, DAD Almost there. Hang on… - Want it higher? No, no, that's good. Come on! Perfect. - Yes! Did we get likes on Facebook? Yeah, tons. Look, I posted this yesterday: "We're coming to the city!" Where are you going? - I need to be alone. A farmer? At your age? Yeah. What's your name? Maxence. I'm Joseph. That's good. We need young people like you to build a better world. That'll be $7. Thank you! Thanks! Have a nice day! Thank you! Have a nice day! Have a nice day! Happy? - Yeah. Dad? Grandpa! You found work? I did, yeah… Yeah, uh… The kids started a business, so I'm helping out. This is your granddaughter, Raymond. Look, Noé, it's Grandpa. She's beautiful. Just like your mother. Will you say hi to Grandpa? And the first shareholder… Manon! Next up: Martin Tremblay! Congratulations, sir. It isn't over yet, ladies and gentlemen! What is Charles drinking? Germain! Thank you, sir! I haven't seen my dad this happy in a while. I've definitely never seen him dance before! It's all thanks to you. You gave them something to be proud of. There was a bug on your shoulder. Guys! Were you gonna kiss? No. - No! You were so gonna kiss! Get outta here, Charles. - Kissy, kissy! What are you drinking? - A Coke. There's rum in your Coke! - That explains it! I thought it tasted funny. No, no! Hand it over! I didn't even drink the whole glass! - Stop, Charles! Who are you? This is the list. It has all the quotas, along with the compliance guidelines. I'll be generous. You have until Friday to meet the requirements. Hey, I have a great idea! What did she want? Jacynthe called. What did they say? We have to shut down. If we want to keep the chickens, we have to pay $245 a head. We owe $98,000. We need a grading machine, which costs $12,000. Grading machine? Why would you grade the eggs? So they're all the same size. Might as well factory produce them. We also need a refrigerator that costs $25,000. Even though our eggs are fresh daily. It's the damn system! That's Quebec all over. You try to change things, and they find ways to squash your… I miss her so much. She always knew what to say. If she were here, she'd tell you that sometimes, failure is just an… An opportunity to do better My book says the protagonist always faces an "all is lost" moment. That's when he must draw on his resources. Frankly, I don't see a way to keep the farm. It's my fault. It was a bad idea. A terrible idea, let's be honest. And I got everyone involved in my bad idea. Everyone. Your dad was right. My business plan had holes. Huge holes. Massive holes. I think I'll take a break from entrepreneurship. I'll go to university, and… once I get an MBA and I know what I'm doing… maybe then I'll think about starting a business. What's this? Oh, this? It's my idea from the other day. A hundred chickens per coop. We let them out across the land. Their poop fertilizes the soil, and the next day we rotate them. We wouldn't have to clean up their shit anymore. Oh, and there are little doors here to collect the eggs in the morning. "Necessity is the mother of all inventions." This is it! You figured it out! Come on! I never understand a word he says. Listen up! We have until Friday before the Federation shuts us down. Charles came up with something that'll not only save our hens, but revolutionize our business. Other than egg farmers, what are we? Homo sapiens? No. Peasants. - Right. Peasants believe everyone should eat food that comes from happy animals. So we'll do more than produce eggs. We'll sell Coco Farm franchises to peasants all over the province. Across the province, people will buy their eggs from Coco Farms. Nobody will buy eggs from the grocery store anymore. Coco Farm will be the symbol of Quebec farmers, the symbol of respect for the animals that feed us… And every owner will have to follow Coco Farm's code of ethics and make sure their hens follow our "happy hens" program. That's great, but what about our 300 hens that'll be gone by Friday? Each farmer is allowed 99 hens, so we'll build three Coco Farms for our hens before the inspector returns. And we'll need help. Lots of help. Count me in. Careful! - You take that side. Good! - Okay! Let's go! There he is! Hi, Daddy! How was Quebec City? - Good. I missed you guys. Can I leave her with you while I take a shower? Did Charles do his math with Max? They're not back yet. Did you see what they did? I haven't had time. Have they started cleaning up? Denis, I'd like you to go see the farm. YEARLY EGG CONSUMPTION HAPPY HENS PROGRAM Hi, Steve! Do you have an hour to spare today? I understand. Thanks anyway. Okay, thanks, Gaétan. An hour's good. Can you help us out today? No? Okay, thanks anyway. Thanks, bye! Let me get this straight: Say I'm a small farmer from the Gaspésie and I just bought myself a Coco Farm. I sell…. 700 eggs a week, 52 weeks a year, for a total of 36,000 eggs per year, divided by 12 to make dozens… That's 3,000 dozen a year. At $7 per dozen, that's… $21,000 per year per franchise. If we build over a hundred units… that's about $3,000 in construction costs per Farm. We sell each unit for $5,000 plus a yearly $1,000 fee per franchise to use the name. Exactly. Every Quebecer will be eating fresh eggs laid by happy hens raised by real farmers. If we sell 100 Coco Farms the first year, we make… $300,000. I don't know what's happening. It's like I can see the numbers. And year two, just in franchising fees, we make… $100,000 guaranteed plus new franchisees at $6,000 each. I'll fund the first year, plus construction of the first hundred units. But after that, you're on your own. Deal! Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Dad. Great! Thank you! Now hurry up, people are waiting for you outside. Okay, let's go! Hello? Is she there? She's here, but she's… caught in traffic. Relax, it fell over. What do you want me to do? Look, sir, I don't have all day. I've got two inspections to do! I'll have your licence revoked! Turn around and go back where you came from. A little higher… A little more. Almost there… Clean up! Quick! We don't have a farm. Now we have three. This one belongs to Mado. This one belongs to Yvette and Germain. And that one… That's Raymond's. 99 hens per unit, which we'll be selling all across Quebec. Is there a rule against that in your big book? No, I don't think so. This all seems… Compliant. Goodbye. Good riddance! "For months now, Coco Farms are being distributed to farmers across the province. More and more people are flocking to Coco Farms to buy fresh eggs… encouraging both local farmers and their happy hens that are, according to the Coco Farm code of ethics, raised with respect and love. Egg sales in grocery stores have plummeted, which begs the question: is this the end of the road for mass-produced eggs? Is it the beginning of the peasant revolution? One thing is certain. Three 12-year-olds have shown us that change is on the horizon… And if we don't act now, the next generation will." IN MEMORY OF ROCK DEMERS WHOSE STAR GUIDES OUR WAY
