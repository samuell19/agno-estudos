Secret "Red Flowers" It is time, Amina. Come on, hurry! I'm still not heard, my King. God! My son came to this world, After his poor mother she was already dead suffering. The lightning that struck her, did not hurt being, which was to be born. Do not think that something is a miracle, my wise , Kamez? It was already written in ancient prophecy the Gods, what happened here. Now, lead me to your newborn son. Come with me! Tell him to leave us alone. It's not so bad what you want to tell my son You do not want to talk in the presence of his mother? The secret is a dangerous thing If more people know his content. Let us, please! Right. Let's go ! As long as you know you Eman, this secret will be a terrible thing, But only our enemies, not for you. If you know Prophecy, is fulfilled: Newborn this son of yours will become champion of all men And will be the savior of your city. Must not forget that even today, Walls of my father around the city Uthor , Always were always respected by desert nomads. Yes stayed away. But they closely fierce tentacles like an octopus the city. If they will bulk attacks on caravans, This way will stifle Uthor site someday, paralyzing trade and commerce. And when that happens, no wall will not be enough Strong to protect us. And then my son will defeat them, with the leader in the open. That's prophecy that is written? Prophecy speaks of a King's Uthor Him who shall bring forth a son of the lightning. No one can defeat or to destroy or kill him, Unless they will allow powers. Your son was born a flash of lightning. No man-made weapon, will not penetrate the meat. As any force of nature, will not be able to hurt him in any way. You really think my son has this gift? I be sure of that... only when you give me your dagger. No, you mean you'll try to... - No! - I want to be sure of one thing. This may not be possible. It's incredible. I call on every liar and crook if I would have said this miracle That I saw with my own eyes. Many people will see it your son on the battlefield They come to believe their eyes that see. You said that no man-made weapon , Will not get hurt, even the forces of nature. True, but your son will be vulnerable only one thing, only one. What's that? There's something in Prophecy is indicated by a symbol... "Red Flower". What exactly is this flower, or what it means, I can not say. My own son, invincible in battle. Where is Seymuth? You'll find if you look in there. Maybe it's in his tent. Seymuth Do not believe me? Want proof? Just pull your dagger And do what he did Kamez wise. That convinced you? You have to look now, after "Red Flower" Seymuth. You have to know what does. Just finding "Red Flower" 'll be able to kill the child. Let's kill the baby? What woman on earth Will be able to offer me a son invincible? But he is the son of your enemy. Do you think this baby here will know whose son he is? I are the only ones who know. You and I ! You start to understand me now, my little , Bendress? Yes, I understand perfectly now. November 2 will be the only ones we know. And you can ensure that you can always count on my loyalty . On your loyalty More than your intelligence, little one. And stupidity is more dangerous than this loyalty. Bendress mistakes this game... have great significance for me I can not afford that risk. Come on, try to catch me. Come on ! Who are you? Why are you here? This is my territory. If it's yours, defends it. Ask him! Enough now! Stop the fight! I ordered them to attack you, Kindar. I wanted to see how well it can defend my son. Yes Kindar, I'm the one you expected. I remember when you gave it to me, Was a child who was only a few months. I raised as were my own son. As you can see I kept my promise. I made a man of him. Strong and brave. And now... farewell Kindar. You always knew this moment would come, sooner or later . I've said many times that your father was a great warrior desert. And that one day, will be here for you. Humi, and I entrust my son. I want to make it a worthy warrior me. Count on it, Seymuth. Look, Kindar there before us, United dwells our desert. No one disputed right to have it. Caravans enjoys profit... Anxious to see this loneliness. Here earth, not offer anything human. No matter what we need, We have no choice but to take by force from other people. Father, is it true that your whole city is made of tents ? Of course, because that way the city goes with us When we are about to move. When the weather is dry strengthen our tents And move elsewhere. In a region with more water. So, water is so scarce in the desert? It's so rare that people killing each other for it. You grew up along the river aluviunii. You do not know the meaning of the word "thirst". Without doubt you want to drink, but all you have to do, Is to stick your hands in the river and bring it to his mouth. I will miss it, Kindar. Yes, Humi, but not for long. - What do you mean? - You'll know soon. Look over there, Kindar, see that great city in the valley? It's called "Uthor". In another language different from ours word means "water". Over the years, had an abundant spring. It's only spring in the desert, not never dry. For this reason, it is surrounded by walls. From here out we only have two opportunities to penetrate inside. As conquerors or as slaves. Those seem very resistant walls. Certainly they are well kept. In fact, no one in this desert, was not able to destroy them. But what has not been achieved in all these years , Will happen very soon... When we are on the battlefield, we will fight side by side. What makes you think you are so valuable ? I know much more about you. Much more about you than you know yourself about it. But I never held a gun in his hand , Dad. The better. It will be something new for you to learn art fight. Omar, my son will cross the desert with you. And you shall learn the art of fighting. Teach him how to become a warrior. Uthor's fate will be carried over... And will mean his downfall. Kindar, look back! That man hurt, Kindar? I do not think? Let me look at you. Do not even scratched. You were lucky this time. Let's go after them! Why did you kill a loser? Is useless. No, it's useless. Each enemy you kill him in the desert a defender will mean less When we fight against Uthor's walls. The day will be ordered to attack the city. Let's go ! Why my father I grew up in a country away from my people? Your father, is a leading, boy. All it does is inspired by God Horus. So everything you do, must always be good. I'm afraid I can not say more. I asked the old woman of the tribe, about my mother. But none of them have ever known. It is said that it was a woman who came from another village. And for that you were born in our tents. Do not ever talks about it. You should not think about these issues insignificant! A man should consider his future above all. And your future looks clearer than the past. You are the son of the Grand Seymuth. And someday, you'll take his place as leader. In the desert, the news fly faster than the sand in the wind . I want to know I'm proud of you, Kindar. Your son apparently 'm a warrior. More than apparently sweetheart, Kira. Currently people in Uthor, will trenmura fear at the sound of his name. We will return to camp. Do not go back to camp! Victory! Victory! Victory! Sacalu. Omar, come here, take this girl as far away from Uthor . No, Kindar, the girl is a prisoner... Only your father can decide what to do with it. I'll say about the decision I took. I'm very sorry, Kindar. Your father told me not only teach you the art of war... But also to respect the laws of men desert. Go with you to camp... Because if you do, I will answer for your actions my head. But shortly henceforth nomads, Will become more belligerent with us. Always been so with us. Nomads, they were never offered peace outside the city walls. But now their attacks are becoming wild, every day. Caravans are no longer able to reach Uthor , Dad. And we amenitat city the biggest threat... Each caravan is protected by an escort, son. Yes, but our escorts will be killed in these attacks. What can we do to deal with them, on the battlefield? No, SIRO, that's certainly not the god Horus desire. If I took my first born, which was born for this... Perhaps my brother was invincible... I am ready to die for people in Uthor. You have to live son, because someday You will have to drive here, courageously course. But that is brutal. You are the King, Dad. But even allow me to ride out of town To meet my cousin Nefer. Do not you think that would send a messenger before to announce her arrival? But it will be killed by Nomadic? Yes, it is. Go, my brave son... I would not forgive myself if i never something would happen, My beloved niece, Nefer. Thanks, Dad. If you're afraid that your tongue will be paralyzed woman Uthor... - Tell me who you are. - My name is Nefer. You'll be just a slave anymore. Kindar, I make a gift, it's yours. Make your girl, your slave. Well, what are you waiting for? My gift is not to your liking? What happened? It's not beautiful enough for you? It's too beautiful. Like a fine wine... The more you drink, the faster and climbs to the head. Perhaps your son is ashamed of this great generosity yours... That's ridiculous. Go Kindar woman into his tent. You can go too. You will not be blamed if... Prefer the company of beautiful princesses, than ours. My father gave you to me, to be my slave. But I asked him that. I'd rather leave you free. Do not think for that I'll hate less. But do not you dare touch me. A master can do whatever he wants with his slave . Even if he wants to meet you. And I intend to do with you. You will spend the night in my bed. I'll sleep on the floor to protect you, while you rest. I will not be able, I never see my people. Who knows what the future holds? Those cowards and murderers. The nomads do not kill women, Siro. Spare their lives, to keep them as slaves. Do I find peace in it. We have to find Nefer and have to unleash. We are all with you, Siro. You can count on us. The horses hurry. Prepare the horses! But you are different from others people I have, Kindar. It's true. And I feel a strange sensation... that not even they can explain it. But maybe now I can understand, because you are my closest . I was alone before I met you. Does not it seem a little odd I can to assuage loneliness... I do not have anything in common with your men . But when a person is alone he has nothing to say to himself. Because his spirit is closed. Maybe it's about your beauty, Nefer, One that was able to open my spirit . I beg you, do not remind me I am your slave. Do not talk like being a slave. No, maybe not. Let me here! But you have spoken a word to me if we had known Uthor. I am the son of Seymuth. The leader of a tribe is like a King. Seymuth's most deadly enemy of my people. You and I are not enemies. I'm not sure which are my feelings . I'm so confused I do not know, which are my true feelings. You call it confusion... but I think it has a different name. There can not be that. I already promised Siro, is the son of the King of Uthor. If you say that you were promised someone means that it was made by someone else. No, and I agreed. You should know, Kindar. I myself I gave the word Prince Siro. Humi! Do you know who advised him to give Seymuth was a Princess Nefer's Kindar slavery? Better keep your secrets until you tell them Seymuth, Otherwise you risk them to signal his and his. We will camp here. That seems an appropriate place. Meanwhile you stay with people back Mohammed. What are you going to do? This evening I will try to penetrate alone Nmazilor camp. Once you find out where he is being held prisoner Nefer... Then all will attack soon. You have to let me come with you, Siro. Not going alone, I will not double the risk. Dismount! We will make camp here. Nefer! What is happening here? I do not know what are you doing in my tents, But the only thing you'll find here is your death . Eman King's son, not kill him. King's son Eman? Then we'll give death worthy of his rank. Noble son of King Eman, he will be killed in battle by the son of Seymuth. Put that man under guard! Tomorrow you'll see... I have an idea and I think you'll like. Him down from his horse. Untie his hands. You are a great hunter, is not it? Last night you hunted stealthily, tents my people. But today I will give you the privilege to hunt. Your Booty, waiting. Look a. Come on! If you manage to stay alive in this fight , You return safely to your father. You have my word. You have the word of Seymuth. You fight with your son, If you promise Nefer can go with me. But Nefer can go with you. Of course he can. You could not ask me anything, give me greater pleasure. Kindar! Your opponent challenges you. To death. Have you heard? He's going to fight you, your slave freedom. Wants to take you on Nefer yours. Start! Come. Wait! Kindar Horus, why did not you kill him? Something stopped me to do. Let him return to Uthor, with Nefer. Does your word. You're a fool. I know I owe you my life But I might not be as generous with you When Horus offered me the chance to kill you. - Your hatred is so great? - It's not hatred. I'm afraid of you because you are too great a threat to Uthor. There dunes beyond those e Uthor site. I wish Seymuth son, to kill me. I do not know what to do with my life to come. You want to tell me what's the point to live like To see how Uthor site will be destroyed? Because that certainly will end the fight, Dad, If we continue to hide behind the walls of our fortress. Be quiet! Suffice Siro. Return your son. Or I'll be forced to think your thirst for revenge has blinded you. What I ask you is crazy to me, nothing. Nomads camp When you attack, you yourself admitted ... Value Kindar gathered all the tribes in the West and strengthened them. Yes, noble father. By attacking them, we will delete them from the earth , Before it's too late to do this. Before our soldiers to know that it's invincible And to take talpas hearing Kindar name. There Siro, we will not attack. Our city is safe. It is known among Nomads of our Great Wall. And even the great and valuable son of Seymuth Will not be able to penetrate walls and to break the doors of . Now you know why we built this wall false here in the desert Identical to the Uthor. Yes, Dad, I think I can break Uthor's gate, As we have done with this... If my people I will give to walls time. What do you mean by that? The whole town is protected behind walls, on throwing my arms... They throw rocks, spears, and hot oil. Yes, you're right, my son. Pebbles, hot oil and lances. What else? Giving and arrows also a great bunch of arrows Coming towards you, on Uthor's walls. Archer, step forward! Now put arrows in spring! Knees. Now pull it! Pull it! Do you hear, I said to pull it. Obey my orders, or I'll cut heads. Pull those arrows! Now you see why I knew that you would be our great winner Victory over Uthor's? Course will throw large boulders on you And also hot oil and will shoot and arrows. But nothing will stop to penetrate those walls Because you're invincible, Kindar. Did you understand ? There is no deadly weapon in this world to hurt him or kill him. When will manage to break the gate, we will follow and we will enter the city. Streets will be red with the blood of its people... Air will resound and echo our battle cry victorious And prayers of those losers who will die. No one in that city, must not escape the slaughter. No Nomad, not spare any human being. You have orders not spared even women and children . Because that's great law Governing the world for generations. "My life in exchange for your death." That itself is a great law leading us. There will be lives of fugitives, one that will bring us new death Because we are more powerful than them. The fugitives today, will be those revolted by tomorrow. Remember that always happened As the victors be foolish enough To enable children to become men of the defeated . And to allow women to give birth to other children . But that will not happen in Uthor, Kindar. No, Dad. Now, listen to me. That's my plan will go toward Uthor immediately. Humi and his warriors will go with you as guides. You're going to ram you, as close to the city walls. And the dark, you'll fit ram... Exactly in front of the goal. Then Humi and his warriors will be given back in the fight archers. In the morning their will be a bitter surprise. Defenders Uthor city, will enjoy their last day. If they try and kill the ram, thou shalt push back into town. We will arrive at dawn , And all our people will be trained, attack Kindar you'll break city gate. Kindar! I saw your father's orders 're not impressed. The decision taken by him, to kill everyone in the city. True, Kira. Free slaughter I find repulsive. No. It's for her. Know. But even you, will not be able to save her. Surely she would die like everyone else in Uthor . That satisfy you, Kira? No. What you do not like, do not like me either. It's true that I hate that woman, but do not want death. What I want most, is not ever existed. Do you want to save, Kindar? Then save it. But give it up. There's a woman in Uthor. 's Not for you. How can I save it? If you break that gate, never will not penetrate inside. Do despise my father's orders? Let's get away from here, Kindar. Desert people to leave forever. I would be happy to become your slave, And I will be more gentle and passionate than Nefer. I know how to do it. No, Kira. You should tell me these things ! Or anyone else. - She belongs to, Seymuth. - And you his Nefer. I waited 20 long years this time, son, count on you. You have waited in vain. I will not disappoint you. Nefer! I did not mean to scare you. No, I have not scared at all. Not you scared at all, Siro. I was just lost in thought. What is your concern? Tell me, do not you trust me? But I have nothing to say, Siro. Nefer not want to talk, But your silence says more than a thousand words . Why are you sitting alone in the garden? Without your courage, I would not have been able to get back here ever . In this serene peace and quiet. But my courage was not enough to satisfy . You know we're here just because son Seymuth us free. And I owe him my life. Siro, told me to tell you that my worries . It would be better for you to tell me, what bothers you? Nomadic warriors go Uthor women, to become their slaves. Yes, it's true. Seymuth m offered his son as a slave. But I offended supposed to. Perhaps it would be better if they did a. Acestcaz Because you hate yourself. Right, Nefer? Yes, it is. You have to look. Is an abyss between you two, which can not be filled. Kindar, the worst enemy of our Because it's the strongest and bravest . You are a woman of Uthor. And in the near future 'll become a queen in Uthor Because then you will be married to me. Right, Nefer? More I promise you, is not it? Yes, SIRO, yes. Until now, people have put ram positions in front porttilor... 'll Be ready for tomorrow. Very good, Humi. Kindar, must be very careful what you do. Your father depends on the element of surprise. You can count on me. I will return until dawn, not worry. That's not true, it's impossible? I'm telling you is true. After all this time it was decided to say yes. Trying to make you think you're the only to come. How you guessed it, did exactly what you said. Poor thing. I'm afraid not know women. Certainly do not know, She told me the same things and does not even know. I told myself. Thank you. Good night. I thought I heard something. Sound the alarm! Leave me alone. Leave! All! Kindar. What made you come here? Why have you taken such a risk? If you catch will be your end. Death're threatening you. I beg you, Nefer. Come with me! Tomorrow morning, my dad would attack Uthor site... And enter the city. No one here will escape slaughter. If you say that this will be the fate of my people , Kindar will be mine. Sweet, Nefer... I would not do to live with my people, since you hate them so much. I'll take with me in another country... There, you will have a peaceful life and you'll forget all this. And my memories, such remains Kindar? No, there will be no joy, when the heart is full of bitterness. You say that your people will slaughter my brothers... But you'll be with them, helping to defeat my brothers. I am the son of Seymuth, must obey his orders Even if you disagree the cruelty of battle. Nefer, you know that in my heart, I want to save your people. I can not betray my people's trust. It's your destiny to conquer the city. As is our fate know that... we must die. Your E waiving the one that condemns you, not fate. If Siro as King instead of your uncle, We are so sure of victory. No, Kindar. King not a coward. It's just a simple man, who is mocked by fate. Only few people know the terrible thing which happened many years ago. Before Siro, to be born. The first born of King, was stolen from his home... That son would have grown to become champion Uthor community. He would have freed people forever , You and those who want to invade us. For the gods gave him a gift, that nobody has ever had. It made him invincible. Invincible? I know it's hard to believe. But I do not say nonsense. The first-born of King really was invincible. A counselor Eman right before his eyes... Tried to kill the child and could not do it. Kidnapped, many years ago? How many years ago? Approximately 20 years. So they say. 20 years... And not never heard of him? No, nothing. Kindar! - I want to talk with the King! - Are you crazy? Do not you realize that you will be killed by guards? Kindar! Do you have little chance to get out of here, Kindar. Surrender! Very good, Siro. I want to talk to the King. You talk to King, but also with Horus. Are you really sure that is his son Seymuth? Very safe. Know that we can attack from behind... There is a law written desert nomads, here Uthor. If any of you coming to town, Trying to conquer it will be killed instantly. That's not cruel, but part of our defense. Trying to spread the fear With the threat of this terrible punishment Order to keep you away from us. You came here armed Kindar. You'll die right embrace "Bride of Horus". Dad, you know that I owe his life Kindar. I beg you to play your freedom. You, of all people ask me this, Siro? You said yourself that is the most terrible of our enemies. I do the same thing, remember? If God Horus, given you the opportunity to kill me, You forget all your dead. I mean by this, unless I see on the battlefield. But now, he's our prisoner. Unarmed and in chains. There's a danger to us. To be killed immediately. Kill him. Lock him inside "Bride of Horus". Kindar! Kindar! Kindar! Kindar! Open it now! Look over there! Look over there, Nefer. Kindar, still lives. - Look over there! - What? Live. Kindar. I'm invincible, Nefer. You? You're exactly as the first born of King. E invincible. Kindar! 20 years ago, my first born was kidnapped. And, God Horus, gave to you the same grace. You seem to have aged which should have him now. It is possible that the great god Horus give us and me and my Enemy Sons who are both invincible? My birth was always a mystery to me. But now I understand everything. You, you're my first born? - Yes, Dad. - No, what? It's up to you, Kindar. Do you hear me? Have to break the gates. Do it now! Why did you do that? What does all these things? Your Deception comes to an end, Seymuth. Now I know everything. You know, you think you know, you fool? I know everything Seymuth. I know and things that I've hidden them. And I know why you were so careful to keep me hidden... So many years away from the desert. I know you raised an army to fight my people. You made and shed blood my own brother. And you gave me the heaviest burden that someone can have. Destroy my own city. You said you must open the city gates Uthor. I will, but without destroying them. Open the gates! Open the gates! Whether Horus, to destroy it! Back! Back! Orders attack camels. Follow me to attack! Before! Attack! What happened last night with Kindar ? A walk inside the city! You should not have let him go. Give the order to withdraw. What happened, Seymuth? Are you hurt? I just wanted to die. Well... what are you waiting for? For many years I dreamed only one thing. Uthor to conquer the city. And I was betrayed and deceived! I was betrayed and deceived! In a certain moment, I was about to conquer him. Kira, that fire of yours. Does not look like a "Red Flower"? Seymuth! No, my mind wanders. Kindar, yes, it's invincible, but what I can to waste 's "Red Flower". His mother, at birth, was hit by lightning. And lightning, fire is god Horus. Horus The fire made him invincible. And while I gave fire power to destroy her life. Yes, I'm sure that's true. "Red Flower" must be fire. Fire! Listen carefully. My plan is very simple. Someone will bring it here. You will only need to wait. Nefer will never come in a stinking like this? My daughter is one of the maids. Left to them to handle it. Now pay? - After. - Next. I know a caravan arrives in town today... Bringing large amounts of fine fabrics from Syria... Fine as silk wool, silk pure velvet. - Want to go see them? - Yes I would like ! Do not leave ladies? I have not yet shown the most beautiful things. D-nolor turn around and look at these wonderful materials . You have not seen silks and fabrics such as pure as this. I have not seen so happy as today, Nefer. Yes, you're right, I'm really glad of this mixture. And opportunity to admire many wonderful things. - We have a long walk? - It's not here ! - See here. - But this is not a store, is not it? No, it's home to traders of goods. If Kindar appreciate his life Nefer Tell her to go alone to the temple of the god Horus . Seymuth waits there. It's a trap, nothing else. Do not go, do not go, I beg you son! I forbid you to do it! Obviously Seymuth you to set a trap to catch you. Perhaps he discovered the importance of "Red Flowers" And uses it to kill you. Yes, it's true, "Red Flower". Surely you remember what I said? It's something that can bring you death. There's something hidden behind that symbol That all these years, I was not able to decipher. Father, just know that will kill Symuth Nefer , Is determined to do unless you go. - I have no alternative. - Come with you. No, Seymuth said have to go alone. Wait! Kindar! Kindar! This time, father, not going to listen. I should follow him with my cavalry. You must not be disobedient Because I'm ordering you to go after him, Siro. - Where's Seymuth? - In! Kindar! To leave. If you stay here, you will die. Where is Nefer? Fire flame's "Red Flower". Do you understand what I mean. He will kill you like an ordinary man. Where led her Nefer? No one knows I'm here. Where is Nefer? Kindar, come with me, know where to hide. Quick, until the flames not destroy everything. I beg to escape. Tell me where, Nefer? Not anymore you can, save all you can do is to die with her. Kira, I beg you, where is Nefer? It's there! There ! Thank you, Kira! Kira! Kira! Hurry, save it on Nefer! Nefer, I have come to save you. Everything is fine now. Bastard! Go back to the lad. This time the fire will kill you. Now die. That will be the end of you! You can not do? Kindar! Kindar, beware! Kindar, crocodile. Kindar! What are you doing ? Nefer! Kindar, do not ever do that again! - I can not stand. I'm afraid. - You're afraid ? The crocodile was not fast enough, catch me even once. I have discovered much they are invincible. Are you happy here, Kindar? Yes, Nefer. Siro, was more suitable than me Lead and bring happiness people in Uthor. You'll bring me a thousand.
