I thought she was flirting... Shut up, you scoundrel. Bloody cur. We know that you are a lecher! I was a little drunk... I didn't do anything to her. Those guys took her. And you let them! You would let someone take me too? How dare you? - She is my daughter... - Try doing that again! - Enough, you two. - Tell him! Apologize to her. I will take care of you... even marry you. - You talk to me. - Why should I talk to you? Don't you touch her! What has happened to you? Sargam, open the door! Sargam, open the door! Listen to me! Open the door! Look. Kannu is here... Call out to her! Sargam, open the door. Bastards! They won't let us shit in peace either! Presenting Kannu, the joker! Wanna come to Khandala?

They won't let us shit in peace either! What are you up to? What are you doing? - Don't disturb me. - Come on, tell me. Digging your grave, you idiot. Hey, bro, pick it up. Hey, hold fast! What is this? Stay still. Come with me quickly! - What happened? - Something happened to Kannu. What? Ringtone was saying something and the call got disconnected. - Where? - On the hilltop. Where is Kannu? Mom's here? It's our very own toilet, Mom... You can use it anytime. Come. Come on. Come. Close your eyes. Now open them! Why is she crying? Because Kannu tore up her dress to make the toilet. Let me check. Keep your feet here. Here? Be careful. Kannu, we'll fall... What happened? Kannu's private toilet is now a public toilet! Give me that! Chuck your empty bucket. Kannu's an angry young man. And now in the news... Virat Kohli scores his 50th shatak. Shatak means century. Everybody knows that shatak means century. Quiet. American President in a sex scandal. Son of a gun... He turned out to be a wolf. - Shut up! - How are we going to wash? We'll use our hands. And now in local news... In Borivali, a tendua killed a child. - Tendua means... - Lion? No. - A hyena? - No. - Cheetah? - No! You piece of shit, it's a leopard! Bro! How do we wash? Use your hands! Kannu! Hey... Hey! Help! Extend your hand! - Come on... - Pull! The next time, I will build a roof too. Granny... Let's go. Come on. Ladies, where are you going? What do you mean? You ladies go for a shit at 3 a.m? Because we can't go in daylight. Granny... Where are you going to? You know where we go. To shit? What can we do? There are no toilets here and everyone has to go... To shit? What can we do? There are no toilets here. We want to show you that Gandhinagar has no toilets. By making such a video? If you don't see, how will you understand? Millions of kids in India sleep hungry, mostly on streets. Do we fix that first or make you a toilet? Whether you sleep on the street or home... after eating everyone's got to shit. Watch your tone! This is the problem. Earlier they complained that they have no food to eat and now they want a toilet. These slumdogs are always complaining. Whom did you call a slumdog? Don't insult us. Trying to scare us? It's my mom who is scared... Please tell us... if you can build a toilet for us. Hand me the legal file please. - You're going to explain it to the kids. - Yes. Here it is. Here it says... Why are you throwing me a curve ball? Speak in Hindi. I won't let you go till you understand. The land on which your colony is built is under legal dispute regarding ownership. Between Western Railway and Bombay Municipal Corp. The court hasn't decided. Which means your colony is illegal. Illegal. What's the connection? Big one! Your colony is illegal so no question of a toilet there. Also as per government records, nobody lives there. But we do! As per them you don't even exist. Lady... Am I not visible to you? Rowdiness isn't going to work here. Can a toilet be built or not? That we can't answer. Don't ask us. Then who do we ask? Don't trouble us. Go ask the Prime Minister. Who? The Prime Minister. Give me his phone number. He doesn't talk over the phone. Why are you wasting your time? Oust them. Look here. This is what I have to say. If you want to meet the Prime Minister write him a letter. Where does that go? To his office in Delhi! He lives in Delhi? No, you idiot... he lives in my pocket... Here! Here's the Prime Minister... Here... Take... The prime minister... Go... Go now. We've seen it all. Don't call us slumdogs. Your blood pressure will shoot up over such a trivial thing... My dear Prime Minister, I am Sargam's son Kanhaiya, you can call me Kannu... In my colony no house has a toilet. We have dish TVs, refrigerators, but no toilets. Not one in the entire colony. Everyone defecates in the open. Sometimes on railway tracks... Sometimes on pipes... On the day of the festival Holi... Sainath from our colony hurt my mother. Now whenever she goes out. I am scared for her. She was very sad back then. She still is. Upon seeing her sad, I cried a lot. The number you are calling is out of coverage area. Kannu, the TC is here. My house is too small for us to build a toilet in it. I made one on the hilltop... but it got washed away in the rains. I made it for Mom. I don't have a father. She is alone. You are the Prime Minister. You must have a big toilet in your house. Imagine you didn't have a toilet and something like this happened to your mother... How would you have felt? Please make a toilet for my mother. When I grow up and earn, I will pay you back. My mother is my world. Yours truly, Kanhaiya from Gandhinagar. Hail India! Does the Prime Minister live here? No, the President of India lives here. - Sir, what's the horse's name? - Chetak. - Where does the Prime Minister live? - At No. 7, Racecourse road. How about a selfie, boss? Kannu called. Can't he get through to me? What did he say? He went to meet the President and tomorrow morning he will go meet the Prime Minister. He visited the Qutub Minar too. Bravo! Is he alone? Ringtone and Nirala are with him, don't worry. Yes, don't worry. I will tell Sajju to call Kannu. Brat! Doesn't pick up his mom's call. Mangla, stop! When did he call? Four times since morning. You kids should be slapped. - Me too? - Yes. - Aren't you part of this plan? - No. Don't whine. Next time he calls, give her the phone. I don't want to talk to him. Tell him not to come home either. Stop. Where are you going? To meet the prime minister. You aren't school kids. We just don't have uniforms. Then you can't enter. We've come from Mumbai. Please, sir. Sir, we want to meet the Prime Minister. - Son, you don't have the permission. - How come the others do? C'mon kids, scram. Sir, please we want to meet the Prime Minister. Please, we must meet the Prime Minister. Kids, it's your turn. What are your names? Kannu. - Nirala. - Ringtone. Why were you creating a ruckus? We want to meet the Prime Minister. That's not possible. Then how is it possible? All the details are on the website. You need to take an appointment. We've come from Mumbai. What brings you here? We want to give him a letter. Are you the Prime Minister? No. The thing is we want to make a toilet. For that you need to go to Mumbai Municipal Corporation. They said they can't help. And all decisions are taken with the Prime Minister's consent. The Japanese delegation is here. They were to come on Wednesday morning, right? The secretary preponed it. You've come this far just to give a letter? We'll roam around Delhi if we get time. No, just the letter. Kannu's written it himself. Our work will be done, right? Look, I can just receive it. The rest is up to the system. Where do we find him? - Who? - Mr. System. This toilet is for my mother. Please help. Guess who? You deserve a tight slap! How dare you go without asking me? You'd have scolded and put me to sleep if I had asked you. I'm super hungry. I haven't eaten for three days. Rabiya, make something special. Egg curry? Great! First, you need a good scrubbing. What all did you see there? Taj Mahal. Taj Mahal? In Delhi? I saw it from the train... Your favorite khichdi. At your service, Your Majesty. Here, the receipt. Receipt? With the Prime Minister's stamp. I've spoken to him. Our work will be done. Look at you. All grown up. Met the Prime Minister! I'll do anything for mom. Just tell her to make the food more spicy. Kanna, my darling Kanna. My tiny bite of sugarcane. My little liar, my little king. My diamond-like emerald ring. In your bungalow, Kanna, Will be a hundred toilets. Creating your own palace in the shanty. Clouds may not gather over these, my pet. In your ma's eyes, there's water aplenty. Those distant stars, Kanhaiya, are all an illusion. Don't step on them They will prick your feet. Mom, our toilet is ready. Mom... Our toilet is ready! You've peed in your bed. It happens... Go take a bath. All grown up, huh? Come on. Get up. Went to Delhi and everything! Are there toilets in flights too? Duh! You think big shots can hold on for so long? God has made us all equal. The only difference is they shit in flights and we shit on railway tracks. Look! A shooting star! What did you wish for? If I tell, it won't come true. And you, Kannu? I didn't notice it. Else I would've... Don't stress. The toilet will be made. You are just saying that. Wishing gets you nothing, action does. Only one man can do it. - Who? - Your father? No. The father to all of us. - Who? - Gandhiji. He's been dead for ages now. Show me that. Let me take a picture. Kannu acts dead and we collect money for his funeral. Nobody laughs! If anyone laughs, our plan will fail. For no rhyme or reason. God wakes us up every morning. Temple bells ring. Every morning. If not deaf. Why doesn't he hear us? If not dumb. Well, if He doesn't listen, will you? My dear Prime Minister. Please do listen to my plea. - Donate for building a temple please! - Get aside... - To build a temple. - Give him something, please. The rest is your wish Listen to us. - For a temple? - Yes. Please donate for building a mosque. You're doing God's work. - Where are you building it? - Well... Behind Gandhinagar. Here. If God is deaf So be it... Salute the one Who gives money... If God is deaf So be it... Salute the one Who gives money... You are the government Give us cowsheds too... Given us slums, now give us toilets too I plead you It's all up to you. My dear Prime Minister. Please do listen to my plea. My dear Prime Minister. The rest is up to you Do consider my plea. It's me Pappu Pandey. May I have a word with you? Kannu isn't home. I came to see you. Because of what you went through... you have become extremely sad. Your sadness makes me sad too. I was thinking... You should get tested. I'm not pregnant. Not for that. I mean... for sexually transmitted diseases. I... I should leave. What tests? A blood test. But what do you want it tested for? Diabetes... Blood Pressure... - And STD. - And what? Sexually transmitted diseases. - For you? - Yes. Okay. Come in. Why don't you too, as you are here? Come in. Why did you get the test done? Since you were feeling shy... I was 16 when I first fell in love. When he found out about Kannu... he ran away. And I came to Mumbai... All alone. My father had a bookstore in Allahabad. I would always be there. Because I loved to read. Then as if, all of a sudden, people stopped reading. The shutters came down. And I came to Mumbai in search of work. Whatever I earn... I send half of it to my family. We can manage with the rest. My embroidery work is going well too. I can take on more if needed. You won't have to. - Take it. - Here, take it. - How much have we got? - Rs. 1100. Here's more. - Where is the temple being built, son? - Behind Gandhinagar. - Ahead of the pipes. - Behind the water tank. And the mosque? You pipsqueak! Bribing the police? What did you do? What did you do? Run, Kannu. Run. - What did you kids do? - Nothing. You'll steal money? Rob people? It's for your toilet that I need money. Is this how you'll protect me? By becoming a criminal? - Your toilet will never get built! - Then I will die! I'll die instead, problem solved! - Let's get home. - No. Come to the temple. No, I won't! Fold your hands... No, I won't. Now apologize to God. Swear you will never do wrong things again. Why do you need a temple? We need a toilet, not a temple. Say sorry. You are the one who got raped, why should I apologize? Tell God to apologize to you. I won't apologize to Him. Why are you sitting alone, bro? - See that building? - Which one? They are all buildings. That one? Bro, that one. Umm, that one? Whatever. You see them, right? Count the floors. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... - Shit, missed. - 50. - How do you know? - What do you think I've been doing? One building of 50 floors. One floor with 10 flats, so 500 flats. - Two BHK. - Two BHK means? - Two bedrooms, hall, kitchen. - And 2 toilets. Each has 2 toilets, so 1000 toilets? All in just one building, right? There are many such buildings in Mumbai. Look behind you. And look at our Gandhinagar. Thousands of people but not a single toilet. You know what I wished for from the shooting star? I know - What? It's me. Does Kanhaiya live here? I'm asking if Kanhaiya lives here. Yes. What's he done now? - What happened? - Come with me. What's the rush? - Pomfret. - Pomfret. - Hurry. - Let's go quickly. You were asking where Kanhaiya lives. Now you are doubting her. Don't confuse me now. Just tell me if he lives here or not. What's happening? He had written a letter for a toilet? It's reached the Prime Minister! Can't you speak softly? The letter Kannu wrote reached the Prime Minister, Rabiya. - Kannu did it! - I'll get him. There... Pomfret... This boat is the fish boat? Granny was right all along. Yes... Big fishes... Big fishes. What? Hurry up! The Prime Minister has agreed. The toilet will be made! Liar! I swear, he has. I'm coming. Quick. - The Prime Minister from Delhi? - The toilet will be made, Kannu. Really? Kannu! Somebody please help Kannu. Someone help! Someone save him! Somebody please help my friend. Please save him! Why did you jump? Ringtone did too. To save his ass. Your toilet is going to be built. Now we don't go near the pipes. I mean, we do but only to play or to take a shortcut. A few days ago our toilet was built. Not private but a public one. It had to happen. After all I had spoken to the Prime Minister. Now we will be free of our problems in the morning. - Bravo! - Hey! When you got to go, you got to go. What's the joke, Sargam? It's nothing. Come on, tell us too. Nothing's happening. Rabiya, what's not happening? Where are the taps? Taps? Didn't you carry water? Switch off the lights please. Why? I feel shy shitting under light! Switch off the lights please. My dear Prime Minister. My dear Prime Minister. Extracted by NARACHI
