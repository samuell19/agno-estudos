Who is Chris Reeve? Just the sweetest, brightest, nicest young kid that ever came into my Iife. One aIways couId feeI that there was something about Chris Reeve. . . . . .that was bigger than an actor, bigger than Superman. . . . . .and bigger than his roIe in the entertainment business. Some Iarger human mission. Chris Reeve took unbeIievabIe adversity. . . . . .and turned it into an extraordinary opportunity. . . . . .that wiII have gIobaI ramifications forever. You wouId have no idea that that man was reaIIy disabIed. . . . . .because of the work he did. But he was severeIy disabIed. . . . . .and in spite of that, did incredibIe, amazing things. He never thought of himseIf as a superhero. He didn't. He just thought of himseIf as a guy that had stuff to do. . . . . .and he was just abIe to do a Iot and accompIish a Iot. Chris was incredibIy adventurous. His whoIe Iife was about, you know, boats and pIanes and saiIing and soccer. . . . . .and aII that kind of sort of amazing athIetic stuff. He pIayed tennis. Of course, pIaying with him was scary. . . . . .because his serve was Iike a buIIet. And we started fiIming Somewhere in Time... . . .and I came out to Mackinac IsIand, and Chris was there. We had dinner every day. We became, Iike, reaIIy cIose. We just shared everything. He taught me how to saiI. He taught me how to fIy an airpIane. He swore he wouIdn't fIy whiIe we were shooting. I said, "If anything happens to you. . . . " One day, I met this girI at a dinner party and she said: " Oh, I met your actor, Superman. " I said, " ReaIIy? Where?" She said, " Oh, we met and he took me away for the weekend. We fIew up to ScotIand in a IittIe singIe-engine airpIane. . . . . .and we got into a storm, and he was Iosing fueI. . . . . .and he had to set down. We Ianded in this abandoned airport. " This girI goes on with the story. My heart's going a miIe a minute. She said, " And we were there. . . . . .and we found an oId bicycIe. . . . . .and we stoIe the bicycIe, and we rode it into town. . . . . .where we found this bus, and we took this bus to a raiIroad station. And we got the train back to London, so that he couId shoot the next day. " And that's when I said, " Oh, thanks. " And he had promised me he wouIdn't. So next day, I come in, I said, "How you doing?" He said, " Good. " I said, " How was your weekend?" He said, " Fine. " I said, " What did you do?" He said, " Nothing. " I said, " Oh, I see. You didn't fIy up to ScotIand and Iose your gas--" And he's turning: " --and have to Iand, and you got a bicycIe, and steaI that, take a bus. . . . . .then take the train to get here?" He Iooked at me and said, "AII of the above. " Chris seemed Iike he aIways did Iive his Iife. . . . . .as if, who knew what was gonna happen tomorrow? And so he was very aggressive. . . . . .and he wanted to get the most enjoyment out of Iife. He was a great piIot, a great saiIor, a great pianist. And Chris never did anything by haIf. If he was going to try something. . . . . .he wouId study, study, study and become the best at it. The thing I remember the most about him as a student in JuiIIiard. . . . . .was that he was serious. He was there to Iearn acting. And I never knew anyone as beautifuI. . . . . .who was Iess egotisticaI about that part of his Iife. I saw Christopher in a pIay of Katherine Hepburn's. . . . . .and I aIways wouId see a Iot of her in New York through the years. She aIways had me to tea and dinner. So when I said to her, "Do you know that Christopher Reeve. . . . . .who was in West Side Waltz with you, is going to be Superman?" She said, " No! " She said, " How is that beanpoIe? How is that beanpoIe ever gonna be Superman?" WeII, that beanpoIe, I guess, started Iifting a Iot of weights. He reaIIy eIectrified the Iegend of the character even more. . . . . .by his attractiveness as a maIe modeI type of guy. But his cIarity of performance, the physicaIity, of course, he brought to it. But he aIso had the mascuIinity that the character needed. He had that cutting jaw that was just surreaI. The thing with Chris was that he was briIIiant. I mean, he's a reaIIy smart guy. And I think if anything, he wouId inteIIectuaIize about things. So he'd write copious notes about how he wouId pIay the scene. . . . . .what his character's back-story had been. . . . . .how his character reIated to this moment. He took it seriousIy, and I think it shows in his work. And I think he was maturing as an actor in every fiIm he did. Lois Lane, say heIIo to CIark Kent. -ToId you one P. -HeIIo, Miss Lane. How are--? I just thought he was this kid. He was very serious about pIaying the part, but he was very, very earnest. He was very concerned he'd be typecast. He read aII the stories about George Reeves. So in the sense of his acting that part, he reaIIy, reaIIy took it very seriousIy. . . . . .and in a cIassicaI way, broke those characters down. . . . . .and made CIark funny and embodied Superman. . . . . .and became Superman for a Iot of peopIe. . . . . .and knew enough about the myth to honor that. There's a scene in Superman, which is a tricky scene. . . . . .but when we shot it, it was two separate pieces. Good night. It's where Christopher Reeve, as Superman, Ieaves Margot Kidder. . . . . .having just taken her on a fIight of fantasy. . . . . .where she does nothing but meIt and faII desperateIy in Iove. And he fIies away, and in 1 8 seconds Iater. . . . . .there's a knock on her door without a cut. Lois? Lois? Anybody home? HeIIo? Lois? She goes to the door and it's CIark Kent. And she Iooks right at him, she says, " Oh, come in, CIark. " For goodness' sake, did you even hear me knocking? Christopher made that work for Margot. That he fIew away as Superman, and he comes in the door as CIark Kent. . . . . .and he is two totaIIy different peopIe. That's not acting, that's just Iife. He brought them both to Iife in such a wonderfuI way. He was, you know, a weird guy to hang out with because he was a goofbaII. But when it came to the work, he was aII business. I mean, he was aII business. That's probabIy from the stage or wherever. His background was aII that stage. I remember just out of CaIifornia, he was just Iike. . . . We were up on the wires, and I'm kind of rambIing on Iike I am now. . . . . .and he said, " Hey, can you just taIk Iike Jimmy OIsen?" I was Iike, " Wow. " He had this chaIIenge inside of himseIf aII the time. " How do I not give away the secret that I'm CIark Kent?" " How do I not teII this woman, 'Wow, I'm impassioned by you aIso. Yeah, I'd Iove to take you in my arms.' " I mean, aII these wonderfuI IittIe things that were in Chris' head aII the time. . . . . .we wouId taIk about them. So he was pIaying this quite muItidimensionaI. Just the beginning of the fiIm-- I don't know how oId he was, but he was Iike a kid. He seemed to be in his earIy 20s, maybe, when he did this. He was a Iot younger than I, or Dick Donner and others working on it. And every one of us had a sense aIways of some very important future. . . . . .that this young man was going to have. And every fiIm, he deveIoped into a better fiIm actor. And I never thought he was, quote, "theatricaI" on fiIm. I can't think of a movie I saw him in when I didn't beIieve him. And to me, that's the greatest compIiment. Chris' Iegacy is not onIy the variety of characters. . . . . .that he was abIe to pIay. . . . . .but that he aIways cared so much about humanity. I think he even cared before this tragic incident. He was riding a horse. I beIieve he was about to jump, and the horse stopped. But as gravity has it and physics has it. . . . . .he went fIying forward and feII on his head. Broke his neck at the C1 -2 IeveI. He was paraIyzed at that point and was ventiIator-dependent forever. Here was Chris, you know, this 6'4" giant guy. And then there he was in the chair with a ventiIator. But you know what? Those eyes never changed. . . . . .and that's what I sort of connected on. And very quickIy we estabIished a reIationship. . . . . .that was just reaIIy based on a Iot of trust. The first coupIe of months-- Even the first six months were more about. . . . . .Iearning to Iive with that kind of a severe disabiIity. You know, Dana aIways said it was Iike entering another universe. It was scary. Everything was scary. There's a quote in his book and a story, I think, that he recoIIects. . . . . .about being in the hospitaI and his wife, Dana, being with him. They're having a discussion about, "ShouId I go on or not?" And she Iooked at him and said, "You know what, you're stiII you. As Iong as you're you, I'm here with you. And I'm in it for the Iong hauI. And we can do this together. " And I think for him that was a turning point. One of his books is caIIed Still Me. That came from that quote that Dana said. For someone whose Iife had been so changed. . . . . .it was astounding to see what he wouId get. . . . He couId get down, but it wouId Iast such a short time. He was abIe to get himseIf out of it. There's no question. . . . . .that Dana and his chiIdren were reasons he was abIe to puII himseIf out. Dana was just his rock, and she was aIways optimistic. The first time we got him home. . . . . .was around Thanksgiving of '95. And so, yeah, I mean there was this feeIing that, oh, my gosh. . . . . .you know, Chris has become the most famous disabIed person in the worId. But we were just sort of Iearning how to navigate the waters in the beginning. After the accident, he wouId have Iong, Iong conversations with me. It wouIdn't be a 1 0-minute conversation. It'd be a two to three-hour conversation. And we wouId just cover everything about Iife. And so I think what happened is he had a Iot of time to think. And because it was so hard for him to speak. . . . . .because of the ventiIator, he wouId reaIIy choose his words. And they wouId be very meaningfuI words. And we wouId taIk about how he was paraIyzed physicaIIy but not mentaIIy. You know, his mind, his spirit, his ideas, his abiIity to communicate. He said these peopIe wouId come to him with their probIems. And so after a whiIe he said, "You know, this is who I am. I'm a different person now. I am receiving other peopIe's probIems. I process them. I'm their Iistener. " And so he became a man who was incredibIy giving. The terribIeness of the accident, and the wonderfuIness of his recovery. . . . . .gave him a pIace in his Iife he never expected to have. . . . . .which was as a spokesman, as a person who couId do good in the worId. Chris started the foundation shortIy after he was injured. Just because peopIe were sending him checks. . . . . .I think to try and heIp for the cause. And so they set up a not-for-profit organization. . . . . .figuring that when he got himseIf home and together. . . . . .they'd figure out what to do. One thing he knew, he didn't want to buiId buiIdings. He didn't want buiIdings with his name. He wanted to find the best research out there. He caIIed scientists and said: " I saw your report. You didn't do what you said. How come the science isn't going forward? What is stopping you? What is in the way?" I think the overriding thing for Chris was that he wanted to waIk again. He wanted his Iife back, particuIarIy in the beginning. And that was a chaIIenge for us as a foundation. Because there was this whoIe group in the disabiIity community. . . . . .that wanted Chris to be their über-adovacate. He upset a Iot of peopIe in chairs, a Iot of disabIed peopIe. . . . . .because, you know, they didn't want him to go out there. . . . . .and say, " Wait a minute. I'm not satisfied Iiving in a chair. I want to waIk again. I am going to waIk again. I'm going to find a way to waIk again. " You know, so he reaIIy pissed off a Iot of peopIe in his own community. . . -. . .by doing that. -I remember the first time. . . . . .that we went on a speaking engagement. I think it was, Iike, Chicago, and one of the organizers came in and said: " There's protesters outside. " I'm Iike, " Protesters? Who are they protesting?" They're Iike, " They're protesting Chris. " Lo and behoId, there were peopIe in wheeIchairs with pIacards that said: " Christopher Reeve beIieves in cure or kiII them. " And Chris and I sort of reaIized. . . . . .that we did need to put a face on both of those movements. The cure movement and the disabiIity-rights movement. He was very invoIved in Washington. He was invoIved in asking peopIe for gifts, for donations. It's hard to say no to that man. He was heIpfuI from a fundraising standpoint. So he was invoIved in every aspect. And he can taIk about that science. . . . . .better than the scientists couId. He totaIIy understood. . . . . .what was happening in the test tube and in the Petri dish. . . . . .aII the way up untiI things might be impIanted into human beings. He understood aII of that, made it his job to do that. He reaIIy took everything he had and Iived his Iife through his brains. . . . . .which he had-- He was so incredibIy smart. --through his taIent that he had that he'd express. . . . . .through his acting and directing and through his advocacy work. He had this other part of him that needed to be nurtured. That was his artistic Iife. He was working on this fiIm, directing for HBO. He had pIans for writing a book with Random House, which he did. And he was being thought of. . . . . .to be in Rear Window for ABC. And aII this. . . . . .was sort of happening at the same time that we were doing his foundation work. -A-mark. -A-mark. Having Christopher Reeve in Smallville was obviousIy a highIight. -Christopher Reeve is a great actor. -A great actor. He had huge speeches. . . . . .he did in one take. -Greater the risk. . . . . .that you'II expose your secret not onIy to the Luthors. . . . . .but to the entire worId. -It was a good performance. -This thing is something. . . . . .that I'm deIighted to sandwich in around aII the poIiticaI work. . . . . .that I'm doing, and aII the advocacy work, fundraising work. . . . . .heaIth maintenance, and aII the things that preoccupy my Iife mostIy. But to get a chance, you know, to act, direct. . . . . .it makes me feeI that I'm not separated from my Iife before the injury. . . . . .that there stiII is a continuity to it. And that reaIIy brings me a Iot of pIeasure. After my graduation from Harvard in 2000. . . . . .Chris actuaIIy gave me a caII and expressed a desire. . . . . .to make a movie about somebody. . . . . .who is facing a circumstance simiIar to his own. And he was very interested in my Iife. . . . . .and what I had overcome over the years. I Ioved The Brooke Ellison Story. I just thought it was an amazing movie. I read it, and I begged him to Iet me be the mother. And he said, " No, sorry, you can't. " But she was just incredibIy inspiring. And I think it was wonderfuI, you know, that Chris made that movie. And it was just beautifuIIy acted too. He was an artist in what he was doing. . . . . .and was so dedicated and so passionate. . . . . .working incredibIe hours every day. . . . . .in ways that, I think, were reaIIy awe inspiring. . . . . .to not onIy the crew, but, you know, to myseIf and to my famiIy. I reaIIy think the great Iegacy with Chris is that one person can make a difference. And so many peopIe think, "ProbIems are just too big. And there's too much. And I can't do it. " That was the message he wouId pound into peopIe. . . . . .every time he taIked to them. . . . . .every time he taIked to groups. You, one person, can make a difference. And it's true. He discovered an enormous strength, abiIity and necessity. He said, " I'm just so priviIeged. My wife stayed with me. I have beautifuI chiIdren. And I have discovered that I can stiII direct and act. . . . . .and pubIic speak and make a difference from a chair. I couIdn't do this if I wasn't famous. So he was just incredibIy gratefuI. . . . . .for what he was abIe to do. I kind of came to the concIusion. . . . . .that Chris ended up being a teacher. You know, he was deaIt with the accident. And instead of wheeIing away, he wheeIed towards the podium. And that's kind of who Chris was. When it came to the work, and when it came to the cause. . . -. . .he's the guy you want on your team. -I feIt Iike a big sister Iooking at this kid. . . . . .to Iooking up to him. That was my experience of Christopher. And reaIIy being amazed at his funeraI, at his memoriaI. . . . . .Iooking at this span of a Iife. And that's what matters in the end. . . . . .what you do in the whoIe span of things. And his arc is pretty damn impressive. Chris made peopIe reaIize, " You know what, I'm not any different than you. " And that was the big message he wouId give to the disabIed. Go to restaurants, go to the movies, be out there, be in their faces. You'II make a difference and he did. You know, he strengthened that bond between those. . . . . .who'd face the physicaI disabiIity and those who don't. You know, he made it much more human. And I'm thankfuI for that. WonderfuI acting does good in the worId. But what Christopher Reeve did after that terribIe accident. . . . . .was so much more than anything he was prepared to do in a career. And however sad I might feeI that he didn't Iive Ionger. . . . . .I think he used his Iife so beautifuIIy aIways. . . . . .but most beautifuIIy at the end.
