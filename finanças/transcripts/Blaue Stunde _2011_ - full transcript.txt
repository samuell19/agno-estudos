I can’t be bothered anymore! It’s all pointless anyway! What is it? I just can’t go on like this! There’s no point! Why can’t everything be okay for once? Why must I always fight? Why? Yes! Why do you suddenly agree with me? Dude, I have a total crush, but there is no way she would fall for me! Am I not the one, who can’t get off my backside! I am the one who has this crappy life!

What are you doing? I am here? Often? Yes, well… no! Where are you hanging out then? At home At home? Yes! Well, I was just heading to the Schiller Park! Fancy joining me? Nah, don’t think so. Oh ok what a shame. Well, see you then. Er, no! I’m coming with you! We were at the Woodstock Festival last year also. But when was that…we headed there on Friday and saw the Future Heads and Juliette Lewis the same night and… HELLO! And.. On the third day, Guano Apes were headlining and boy, you were not able to stand after that…. you were dancing and.. and with the next morning the sun comes into your tent And do you have plans for the summer holidays yet? Well, nah, we haven’t planned anything! Are you still living with your parents? Yes, I’m only 16. Oh, you look much older. Yes, a lot of people say that…. Hey, hey, hey! Are you coming for a swim? Ay? What’s the what? Come on guys, let’s go! Are you coming? I don’t have a bike! Ah, don’t worry about that! Don’t you want to come in? I don’t feel like it! Hello, it’s almost 30 degrees! Niklas! I just don’t feel like it right now! Well, then it is about time to find out why that is! Really? Come on, get in the water! NO! Hey guys! Someone doesn’t want to come in! Guys, did you hear that? Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Come on, guys, stop it! Leave me alone! Bloody bastards! Fucking assholes! What the hell! Fuck! Man, why, why me? Fucking assholes! That’s wasn’t neccessary! Yes? Mh, okay, okay, I’m coming! okay, I’m coming! How do you know that I… Your mum.. My mum is a nurse too and she knows your mum. And when I told her about you, well she knew instantly who I am talking about. So, you have problems? It’s not a big deal that I know, is it? Does it still hurt? A bit! I am so sorry! I never planned for this to happen. I thought this was all just fun! Why don’t you want to go into the water? I just don’t feel like deep water. But I like to go into my bathtub! Don’t worry. You can tell me the truth! Have you seen someone? Yeah, but they didn’t find anything! What are they supposed to find? Well, that I am nuts or something! We are all a bit nuts! Maybe.. I had been seeing someone for two years, and then I did not need to anymore. My mum sent me to her now ex-boyfriend. But he is even crazier than me! And did you find out what’s the deal with the water? Yes! So? When I was little, I had a twin brother. And.. We had been swimming in the sea. He wanted to swim out, further and further out. And then… Well, that is probably the reason why I am so scared of deep water. And you didn’t feel like swimming since then! It’s as if… I am just happy that I don’t have to go in! Okay, I see…. Hey Antje, Yes? Hmm Yes Can I bring someone? Mh, okay, see you, I’m looking forward to it! Hey, are you up for a weekend in the village? Is there a lake anywhere nearby? Hey! Maxe, Dude! Great that you are here. Hey, I am so sorry about what happened at the lake. Don’t worry about it! This is where the party is gonna take place! Here you can crash! And here, well here, you can do whatever you want! Make out or whatever! Have you been doing this for a long time? Since I can think straight! I guess you don’t trust yourself much! Not sure! What is it! Are you not drinking? Haven’t tried! What? Dude, what’s wrong with you? Take a sip! Dude, are you kidding me? How come you don’t like beer? Guys, he doesn’t like beer! So what, at least he doesn’t have a beery breath like you! Come on, let’s dance! I don’t feel like it! Come on, I’ll show you! I can't even dance! Everyone can dance! So, grade 10… I was out and just looked fabulous! And there were those three guys! Three hotties! And so I was thinking: Yes, woman – you are passing them now! You look great, I’m all dressed up! Bring it on! So I passed them and all three looked at me stared at my ass and I thought: Hell yeah! And suddenly they started laughing! I turned around and just thought: Fuck! There was toilet paper sticking at my back! How embarrassing! Ha, clean work! Five points for that! I have another story! So I was in the third grade! And there was this absolutely beautiful girl! She was blonde and the prettiest girl in class. I so wanted to impress her. Well then, listen and learn! I was in the third grade too! Swimming lesson! I was late as always and I thought: Let’s hurry and not put on underpants. Just wanted to be quick. And then I was on my way and I noticed that I had forgotten my swimming trunks. I had nothing with me, but we had an assessment, so I had to take part, with or without pants. Naked Life is playing tricks on you sometimes. So, I had to jump in! And I was swimming around and my willy… No way, you’re lying! I am not buying that! Why don’t you believe me? You think I did not do it? Come here, buddy! I’m with you! Let’s go! Niklas, you’re a great kisser! I like you a lot! Do you trust me? Have you ever had sex with a girl? I think I want you to be my first! Niklas, what are you afraid of? I don’t know! What are you afraid of? I think I am afraid of life! I always ask myself why I had been born in the first place! Don’t we all ask ourselves that? I mean, why am I here? What’s the point? You are meant to do good things in life! What good things? Niklas? Yes? For ages we plan to go to the Woodstock Festival. I’m not sure. But I’d be really happy if you came with us! How many are we? Well, we are just 20 but in gerneral 400 000?! I’ll think about it! And? Have you got everything? If the offer for that sleeping place is still open.. than.. than yes. Put up your sleeping place! Are you looking for something? Lotta! She was looking for you. But she is gone now. Left about half an hour ago! Just wait for her here! Oh, hi! Who’s there? The loser! What am I supposed to tell you! Do you want to know where Lotta is, or what? Why should I tell you this? Because I love her! Of course, you love her! And because you love her so much, you just go and screw another or what! Dude, you are so disturbed! You’re a freak! Fuck off! Wanker, asshole. Hold on! Wait! She wanted me to tell you that she is disappointed! Where is she now? Please.. Well, she obviously isn’t here anymore! Where is she? Some guy took her to Rostock!
