YEAR 1942, THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN BEIJING Plan one is in motion. Go ahead and begin plan two. He is heading your way. You might get caught! A thirsty dog must drink. Take the list and go! You'll become a nameless ghost in this foreign country. Is there anything more to say? Please go! Or else you will depart from this sorry world too! You are a good person. I wish I had you... It doesn't matter whether a person is good or evil. We will all die eventually. Only the method and purpose may vary. If this is our fate, let it be. We shall meet it head on! Why do I have this nagging thought that someone could break in here? It must be my paranoia. "To Elegy, the queen of darkness," look up at the stars in the sky. They shine at night and people hide in the darkness. Evil was born in the night. Throw down the chains of betrayal, and take my fist as repentance"? No. This can't be happening. Your lies are unforgivable! Why did you do it? Why? I had no choice! Enough with the excuses! Tell me this isn't true! When puberty hits, love becomes more important than friendship. When one gets old, pursuit of happiness becomes more important than national security. Enough with the show! Who would cast a stone at her in this time of tragic history? Codename Madam Jang. Her real name is Sook-ja Jang. She was once an ordinary girl with dreams. She looked old for her age though. But as her family fought against the Japanese occupation, she was naturally influenced by their involvement in the movement. She soon found herself following in their footsteps as a secret agent to help achieve independence for Korea. Being a secret agent for 13 years had deprived her of her youth as well as a normal love life. She fell in love once, but she was sacrificed it for the love of her country. Sook-ja was also a woman who has burning passion running through her veins. Away from her family, she spent years alone carrying out dangerous missions. She blew up buildings. There, another explosion. She tortured spies. Inflicting pain. She killed people, but every night she felt utterly alone. Then one day, a lonely wolf came before this lonely woman. My goodness. She fell in love with this man, and his name was Damanegi! I chose passionate love, that's all. I don't want just a fling, or something to shield me against loneliness. So, you have some innocence left in you. But you have committed treason and cheated on our country! Cheated? I'm not married to my country! It's still common law marriage! This doesn't change anything! Don't pick flowers that have already withered. Enough! Stop defending yourself. Just accept your sins, and end your secret agent life! Accept my fist while you're at it. Swallow it, and you will explode in five seconds, Jang Madam. It's not Jang Madam. It's Madam Jang. I see. Bye, Sook-ja. What is taking so long? My goodness! What took you so long? Was it because of Madam Jang? So... It was true. Who would have thought that she would end up like that. A beautiful rose has many thorns. The list of Japanese agents? Here. My goodness. I believe it is time to bid farewell to this place. Ready? With you, always. SNOWY HORSE TOKYO, JAPAN Good evening. Today we talk about the Golden Buddha that contains names of Korean secret agents who are threatening the future of the Japanese Empire. The agents on the list work all around the world to collect funds for their course. The moment we get that list, the freedom fighters and the Shanghai provisional government, who have been expanding their activities down from Manchuria, will take a tremendous hit and be forced to retreat. We have received the reports. But how do you propose to get your hands on Golden Buddha? Well... Okay. Sir, how are you going to get the statue? Provide us with cash and we shall get it for you in no time. We also like Miss Myeong-wol. If we give them basic information and cash, they can bring us the Golden Buddha in no time. Also, they like Miss Myeong-wol. I see. I can give you the necessary funds that you need, but do you know where the statue is? Did he say he can give the money but is worried about the statue's whereabouts? Yes, that's right. Then, tell him not to worry about the whereabouts of the statue. He says, you don't have to worry about the whereabouts of the statue. How come no one is translating any of this into Chinese? I don't understand anything. Just have the money ready and I will tell you where it is. To guarantee the safety of the money and the statue, let's meet in Switzerland at the World Spy Conference. We'll make the exchange in a secret bank there. - Sir. - Yes? Let's exchange the statue and money in Switzerland. Watch out! Goodness! Sorry, sir. We tried our best. You idiot! So, someone was listening. There she is. - There. - Over there! Over here! A pussy cat with sharp claws. How cute. How much to buy you? I want to buy you. I won't ask for a discount. Your words are as foul as your breath. You're obviously not an ordinary cat seeing that you made it this far. Why you... You traitor! That was my mom's name. Listen, you son of a traitor. I'll kneel before you today, but mark my words, everyone will know your treacherous acts! I see. You leave me no choice, but to zip up that cute little mouth. DOOMAN RIVER "It is like moths to a flame." Or, "out of the pan and into the fire." Doesn't that mean that the situation is getting worse? Wouldn't "as leaves in the wind" be more appropriate here? But that implies that we are helpless. Leaves have no voice, but our comrades are crying out to us. That is not logical. Such good ears you have. There is only one thing we can do. We must send him in. You don't mean... - Let me help you, ma'am. - Okay. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Oh, my back. Oh, no! What's going on? What is wrong with him? My goodness! My money is gone! Hey everyone, my money is gone! What do I do now? Is that how you greet a person? You bastard! Give it to me. Hey! You're pushing it. Are you testing my patience? One of us is certainly being patient. Look at this guy. I'm afraid I have lost my patience a long time ago. That's your problem. You are on my nerves! What an idiot. You're determined to sign off your life on a speeding train! You seem to have signed off on your decency, little boy. Who the fuck are you? Don't you recognize the Border Lynx? You should already know my name by now. - My goodness! - Yes! You're... Goodness. Lynx or Mink or whoever you are, this is getting heavy. Could you return it to the owner? Yes, sir. You thief! Why did I do that? It's all my fault. Sorry. It was all because of you. Are you giving my money back? Would repenting now cleanse my disgraced blood? I found it. I reproach myself to no end! Oh, God! Weep. Weep until all the bad blood is washed away by your tears. Who doesn't make mistakes? Did we come into this world to cry? As long as there are youngsters like you who will acknowledge their sins, our future is still looking bright! My goodness. It's time to say good bye. Good bye. Sir! What do you want? I live this sorry life because I met the wrong kind of people. I wanted to meet a person like you and take the right path, but reality would not let me do so. What a pity. But if you take me under your wing, I will dedicate my life to doing the right thing. Goodness. He's so handsome. I am not big enough of a man to be responsible for another man's life. I understand what you mean. But take a look around. I'm sure you'll find someone who is much worthier. No... Let's not forget how we crossed our destined paths today. A round of applause. A round of applause. Dachimawa Lee! Dachimawa Lee! Dachimawa Lee! SHANGHAI STATION, CHINA Help me! Trying to resist me makes you even more irresistible. Being the men we are, how can we pass this up? I'm sure she's delicious. She'll taste like wild raspberries. Why are you doing this? I'll scream! Go on, scream! We also enjoy having a woman scream and swear at us. Stop! What? No wonder the sky was as overcast on my wife's ugly face today. It was a sign that I would meet an obnoxious guest from Korea. You should be careful. Or something bad might happen. You filthy Korean! I'll let you sleep on a cold bed, six feet under! There's nothing like Korean martial arts to wipe the smile off your grotesque face! - He's cool. - Martial arts? I'll take you on. This should be fun. Oh, no! What? Take this. Take that. Take this. Take that. Take this. Take that. - Take that! - You protect yourself quite well. I see you've been taking lessons from a master. But you underestimated me! Take that! Use karate. Come on. Take this! And this! How about that? You Korean! This samurai will teach you a lesson! Didn't expect that, did you? Roll! I'm hit. Take that. - Poor maiden. - You're so noble. Don't worry. My ribs! Neck breaker! Take this! Shoulder breaker! Impressive. You live up to your reputation. Nice to meet you. I'm Mari and I'll be your partner on this mission. Then? You are really something. I'm Agent Six. I'm not sure I like this kind of greeting. I apologize if we've offended you. But we needed to see if you were up to the task. You'll be my partner? What about Yeon-ja? I guess you haven't heard. She's been missing for two days. She was in a mission. It's unlikely for her to still be alive. - No way. - Yes. She's dead. Agent Yeon-ja was tracking a leak within the agency when she disappeared. This is Snowy Horse. It's a restaurant in Tokyo. Snowy Horse... She knew Japanese agents met there frequently, so she worked undercover as a waitress. So... the horse got to her. According to her reports so far, Japanese spies are looking for this. Is it real gold? It's only 14-karat gold. More like a single coat actually. That's not important. What's inside is important. Inside the Buddha? The statue contains a list of all our secret agents who are working around the world to raise funds for an army for our independence. What? Agent Eight managed to get the statue and is waiting for us in Manchuria. The problem is that Manchurian bandits are tracking this statue too. You must go to our lab at Princeton University to get weapons and funds. Okay. Come on, hurry. Who is this guy? You're still in your prime. You're still a sweet talker. I heard about your mission. It will be your most difficult and most dangerous mission yet. Laying down my life is not a big deal when it is for my country. Until the East Sea And the Mount Baekdu All wear away May God Protect our country Rose of Sharon And the beautiful Mount Kumgang May you live on forever With Korea and its people Give me sample number 1002. You bad man! What? Up to your old tricks again? What? Stealing women's hearts. There's no time for jokes. Yeon-ja is... You're right. Sorry to hear that. I forgot we have no time to waste. Oh, wait. Take this. What kind of weapon is this? Hold on. You! Hold your temper. This is a breath of heaven. It's fine. This is something called a chewing gum. It was developed in Mexico and the U.S. in the mid 1800s. It's a must for agents like yourself who meet all kinds of people. It stays chewy in your mouth without melting. Now, let's get started. You're familiar with this model, right? This is... It's the latest automatic model. But it's made from an alloy unlike the other models. That's why it is heavy. One hit and it's lights out. But in order to match the weight, the barrel is filled with a special alloy. So, the bullets here - will have to be used in a different gun. - I see. Last but not least... This. Isn't that a sprayer? For hydrochloric acid? You're thinking like a field agent. This is not simply a sprayer. This is a portable bidet and it's still in development in other countries. What? Our agents suffered from irregular lifestyles and frequent all-nighters. Last month, Agent 62 who worked in Frankfurt lost his life to bleeding caused by hemorrhoids. So! The uncomfortable feeling you get when taking a poo after a long stakeout or after a sweaty chase, you can say good bye to all that. I'm sorry for sending only Agent Mari with you on such a dangerous mission. It only seats two people anyway. It would be my pleasure to go with such a beautiful agent. You're a bad man! I'm embarrassed! Oh, no. God, that must hurt. She looks tough, but she's a soft-hearted woman. Please look after her. Whether an agent is a man or a woman, it makes no difference. Agent Mari is just an agent to me. For so long, you have opened up to so many female agents, so I'm quite surprised by that remark. I want to make one thing very clear. Yeon-ja is the last tenant of my heart. Then accomplish this mission in her honor! Agent Lee, are you crying? I believe, it is the rain. What rain? AMERICA There's a speed limit up ahead. Please reduce your speed. ANTIQUE ALLEY MANCHURIAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE MARKET Hello. Please come in. Good day. You have a lot of nice things. I didn't know there was such a place. Just tell me what you need. We're looking for a Buddha statue. I see. We have those. What kind are you looking for? One that's made of gold. My goodness. - I'm sorry. - Why? We don't have any gold ones. Really? We heard that you have it. You were misinformed. Misinformed? No! So, the statue sprouted wings and flew off? Agent Eight? Bring on the statue before I count to three. - You coward! - One. - Just kill me! - Two. For our independence! Three! Hurry. Watch where you're going! I'm sorry. Let's go! You can even speak Chinese. How many languages do you speak? Enough to embrace the whole world. My goodness. How could they? Maybe... We were too late. If your hair didn't get caught in the propeller, we might have arrived in time. I don't know what to say. I take full responsibility for not separating my emotions from my job... Agent Eight! I thought I wouldn't get to say good bye. I'm relieved to see you. Save your breath. It's too late. Agent Eight! Agent Eight! Agent Eight! I didn't carry out my mission. Please forgive me. Who has the right to forgive? Human beings do not have the right to give forgiveness to others. There isn't much time. What? It was the Manchurian bandits. A man called Mr. Wang. He's their contact. Mr. Wang! If you take a horse to the place I'm about to tell you, you might catch up to them. The horses outside... No! Agent Eight! Agent Eight! Sang-pal! BLACK DRAGON RIVER Agent Eight is now gone forever. The world is working against us. That means we are alone in this world. If you think of Agent Eight leaving us, I would say this is more of an upsetting and painful situation. How did he die? To get the statue, the Manchurian bandits tortured him and suffocated him to death by forcing snot and saliva down his throat. Those villains! BANDIT HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN MANCHURIA We should move before it's too late. The two of us? No. The statue is obviously there. If I fail and die, you must go and get it. You have to stay here in case I... Don't say that. Don't even say that jokingly. Really... Mari! I don't want to put you in danger. Dachimawa Lee. Promise that you will come back to me. We shouldn't. We should. Why is my heart racing? My head and my heart are conflicted. I'm ready. I can't do this. You can. - That's right. - Your lips are drawing me in. Oh, no. Ow. Ow. Dummy. Ow. Sneaking in is going to be tough. One hit and it's lights out. This is not enough. What shall I do? So, the bullets here will have to be used in a different gun. Professor Nam prepared me for every possible situation. I just hope he lives a long, full life and continues working for our country. Don't kick. Pull. That hurts. Drop your weapons and raise your hands! Wait, this is Manchuria! I said, drop your weapons and raise your hands! I like your spirit. What do you want? I heard that there's a lot of money to be made here. I want a cut. What are you talking about? The Golden Buddha! What? What the hell are you talking about? Whoever chops his head off gets a case of gold! - Get him! - Yes, sir! Hurry! I told you not to come down here! We don't have much time! My license is restricted to cars. I told you I don't have the right license. Where is the statue? Here! Mari! Oh, no. Bring me his dead body! Quick! Find the Golden Buddha! Come on. Find it! Oh, no! Come on, get a move on! Come on. Where is it? Oh, no. Where am I? Who are you? Why am I here? Oh, no. I don't remember a thing. How I came here... Who I am... I don't know who you are, but you seem like a rich businessman or a diplomat. Why is that? You had a lot of cash in your pocket. So, I guess you're buying lunch? What would I do with money when I don't even know who I am? This was in your pocket too. I don't know where it's from, but it looks like a sturdy device. I'm not sure, but I don't think... Are you whining over a bottle? No, it's just that... How come you didn't prepare protection money for me? Do I have to beat the crap out of you? What are you looking at? Get out of here, all of you. My goodness. Sir! You should be more careful. Just let me know if you have any problems. What a strange man. Sir... Wait here. Sir, how long has it been? Do you know me? Sir. You're pretending not to know me just because I made a tiny mistake? What are you doing way out here? I don't know. Have you seen me here before? Sir, I know it's my fault that I haven't grown up to be a better man, but if you keep this up, I'll get upset. Who the hell am I? Let me go! If you don't want me here, just say so. - There's no need to publicly embarrass me. - How am I so strong? Like I told you before, I didn't plan to keep living like this. I have an aging mother, sisters who are getting married, my cousins and half cousins who were born out of wedlock. I have a huge family to take care of! You're so cruel. What does his family have to do with me? I don't know. Dachimawa Lee, just wait and see. You should've knocked me down when you had the chance. I shall never forget how you have embarrassed me! What the hell? - Damn it! - Who's this? Sir! What? You're from Korea, right? We're looking for a Korean. You can be our man. What? It fits you well. That's the only thing my dad left me along with his cooking knife. Memories are a beautiful thing even if you are alone or sad. But I... I remember absolutely nothing at all. Mister. Can you chop up some wood so that I can light a fire? Hurry up with the firewood. I can't do this. The ax is broken. Then, what do we do? We could starve or freeze to death without fire. Then, are you suggesting that I use my fist? What are you mad at me for? You could use the knife in the house. Mister! Stop! Stop! Spare me! Hey! Move back, you dickheads. You've got nine lives. You thought you could hurt me and get away with it? Why are you doing this to me? What is with you? Dachimawa Lee. What happened to your aura? Turned into a sissy now, have you? He's nothing. Dachimawa Lee? There must be a misunderstanding. Misunderstanding? You bastard! What happened to your manners? You insist on disappointing me? I used to respect you! I've seen enough. Let's just chop his head off. Sir, just give me a minute. Do you want to live? We could let you live. But then you would have to pay us back. Here. Crawl under my legs while barking like a dog. But... Or we could show her a good time. Let go of me! How could you do this to your own countryman? Countryman, you say? Where I stand is my country. The fate of the seeds change depending on the soil. You wilted and I bloomed! - Sir! - Wait! So, you're thinking about it. Dachimawa Lee is crawling. Bark like a dog! - Woof! - Louder! Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof! You're so talented! Do you think your fist is really all that? It's all soft and mushy. Get up, you fuck. Go on, do your thing! Please. Bring it on, smart ass! That was fun. - Sir. - Yes? If we kill him now, it won't make us feel that much better. His hands are useless now, so we can keep him here and torture him whenever we like. That sounds good. You're certainly worthy of being my blood brother. You're no better than a worm! We win! Mister! Get up. Are you up? Help me with this. We have to burn all this and leave. What? Leave? They said they'd be back. Burning everything and running away is not the answer! I may not know who I am, but I know what's right and what's wrong. Life is not about running away! You're all talk, you know that? Give me that. You don't even know who you are. What can you possibly do when you can't even use your arm? What? - This is... - Give it back! It can't be! You have a way out or what? - You shouldn't be reading this! - What is it? It's a romance novel. There might be more. It's hot! Yes. This is it! That's... The knife inside is not for cooking. It's the broken sword of a warrior. Your dad was not a cook. He was a lone warrior who secluded himself from the world. Hot! Yes! What? Mister! Oh, no. You walk with confidence. Come on, then. Why are you stopping, fucker? Feeling better now, Dachimawa Lee? Last time was no fun, so I waited for you to get better. But seeing that you look fine now, it's either you recovered really fast or I didn't hit you hard enough! It's all gone! You must have saved on bandages! I thank God for bringing you back here. You just picked your day to die. This day is too nice to die alone. You all had your last meals, right? You bastard. The one-armed swordsman! This is getting more and more interesting! Here are the tickets for you villainous bastards! What tickets? For the express train! Curiosity is killing me! I wonder what tickets that big mouth with no balls got for us? Stop stalling and just say it! All in good time. It's where all evil men like you go. It's going to be a long trip for all of you. Do you mean hell? You! I'll send you on a one-way train! You're going nowhere near heaven, anyway! What are you waiting for? Off with his head! Yes, sir! You're all tied up. Don't come any closer. I'm ready. I'll block. Pathetic to the end. Completely impenetrable. - Hey, sir! - What? Fuck it. Oh, no. He's in front of me. He's so handsome. - You. - What? That hurts. He's so strong. You bore me. I'm falling down. Are you faking it? Get up! I'm sorry, sir! Another beating. You're overacting. You thought I couldn't remember who I was. Border Lynx and Mr. Wang! Both of you! You brought me both luck and misfortune. Firstly... you trampled on my pride and gave me humiliating pain. But physical pain fades away. The greater pain was not knowing who I was. But when you hit me and I hit my head on the ground, the impact brought my memory back. Is he combing his hair? Then, you are? He looks fine. Yes. Border Lynx! My goodness. You shed crocodile tears on the train to Shanghai. Don't expect me to have mercy on you. Wait, sir! I know the whereabouts of the thing and the woman that you are looking for. No! The thing is already in Switzerland. A traitor in your agency did this to you. That's what he told me. The traitor is... How could you? Switzerland? A traitor in the agency? Mr. Wang! Stop! I need more answers from this tongue. After I hear those answers, I'll cut it myself. What's this? It's me! He's like the wind. Dachimawa Lee! Come here for a moment. If we had met in good times, we could have been friends. Sure. It's a shame. No way. Because of the age difference, we couldn't have been friends, anyway. Mister. Girl with no name. It's time for me to say good bye. Take this to remember me by. What? This was mine. Mister. Now that your memory is back, please tell me your name. Mister! You will always be in my heart! I have no regrets now! UNDERGROUND BUNKER INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE HALL, SWISS What happened, Dachimawa Lee? Where have you been? I had a slight problem, so I took a little detour. What about Agent Mari? What a pity. Something doesn't add up. Only Agent Mari, you, Agent Six and I knew about this mission. According to my sources, we have a traitor in the agency. Where did you get that information? Three minus one is two. You and I make two. Two minus one means that one of us is the traitor. Now reveal yourself. After you contacted me, I got to work and found out that the statue and the money that was taken from a safe in Geneva, will be exchanged in the Alps area. It won't be too late to continue our conversation there. What makes you so sure? The confidence of someone who holds the key to the truth. That's a rare commodity. You can't dodge an unexpected bullet. I leave the rest... to you. SWISS SECRET DAIRY BANK That is where the exchange will take place. Only the main participants can go in. You won't need back-up. So the truth will come out. We'll see when we open it. Whether it's a treasure chest or a Pandora's box. Wait! You follow that Japanese fellow. I shall follow the Shadow Man. Chances are the statue is in the Japanese man's bag. Get the bag and meet me at the opera theater we talked about! The opera theater! We must hurry. All right, then. Hey! Shepherd! Stop following me! Oh, no. Run! Stop! Hey! Come here! Come here! Damanegi! - Is that a snowball? - I don't know! Oh, no! Help! Help! I'm out of breath! You scum! Damanegi! Damn! That slippery little eel. Almost there! Take that! Farewell. My secret weapon! What a loser. SWISS NATIONAL OPERA THEATER Over here! What? You're... They might be listening to us. We must be careful. What happened? Everything was a plot. A plot? The traitor is... Hide! That treacherous... Now that your secret is out, how do you feel? What? You still have no idea. Enough of your lies! Look at this first! What? Yeon-ja! Yes, it's me. You still don't get it? The real traitor is... So, your efforts paid off. No. No! Not after everything I went through to find you... It can't be. I was one step ahead of you. Save the drama for your buddy on the way to hell! I faked my death. A precaution to counter the intel that the agency was tracking the traitor. Actually, she's the daughter of the traitor. Then... Yes. I'm dying here. Unfortunately, Agent Nine lost his life to save mine. So instead, I became Agent Six and continued with the mission. Then who are you? The real me? This is who... I really am. Then... That motorcycle was rigged, and you made me drive it on purpose even though I had the wrong license. Those bandits only threw rocks, but there was blood from your chest like it was hit by a bullet. Then the sidecar fell off. Everything had already been planned. One more thing. She was disguised as Shadow Man, but I found out who she was. Having lost the money to me and getting shot, she came here to see you. Then what happens next? Seeing as you're still talking, I guess you're not the type to go quietly. Look at me. Who do I remind you of? - It can't be. - Are you... Madam Jang, who died at your hand... She was my sister! You two brought it upon yourselves! That's not our fault! You can't say it's not your fault when she died in your hands. If you don't want a hole in your chest, give me the statue in the bag. I'd rather take this to hell where your sister is right now. No! Give me that! - It's for indigestion! - I can't let you die twice! How touching. Let me! Oh, my! Enough with your tactics! No more warning shots! I have one last thing to say. I'm not interested. I know that you won't shoot me. Shut your mouth! No! Your love for your country may have faded, but not the love you have for me! - Enough! - Take it! - Stop! - No! Mari! You're a bad man. I don't want to die. No use regretting now, isn't it? Stop that. Just as my heart was finally ready to let in another tenant... It's getting dark in here. It actually is dark. Really... I don't want it to end like this. Luckily... the silicone in your breast saved your life. Don't lose hope! You have dreams that no silicone can ever replace! Being with you in my final hour makes me feel like my dirty soul has been saved. Please know this one thing... Let's not say anything anymore. Mari! When you're tired of a scent, you replace it with a new one. Dogs attract dogs and blood draws blood. Just put down your toy gun. Don't worry about me. Just shoot him! Feisty as usual, kitty cat! I'll let you live with the guilt of having killed Mari! Stop! Where is... There's no need to hurry. I have a plan. SWISS SPY HOTEL Hey! Then please check this. Serve this specialty tonight to the people on this list. I mean... Just make sure... Put this in their drinks. Our company made a special list of people with jet lag. We're giving vitamins as gifts. We got the statue, so our mission is accomplished. I'd like to see the statue with the list of people who have been bothering us. Well, I just happen to... have it right here. ORIENTAL EXPRESS FROM SWISS TO SHANGHAI How... How can you laugh at a situation like this? Our agents' lives are in danger. I can't believe you. How would they know our agents? What? Are you kidding me? Did you hurt your head? We lost the Golden Buddha again. My goodness. Do you mean... - Do you mean this? - What? Great! May I look at it first? Of course. Yes. What a big catch! But... did the Korean agents get all the Japanese aliases? Let me see! INTERNATIONAL SPY CONFERENCE JAPANESE DELEGATION Kakemochi. Denkang. Nimai. Sumu. Pare. No! Idiot! This is cheap gilding. We're fucked! How could you not check it? It can't be! You'll be executed for disclosing top secret information and killing agents. What? Then you switched the list of Korean agents with Japanese agents? The mission felt wrong, right from the start. So, I set a trap just in case and Damanegi fell right into it. You didn't suspect me too, did you? I'll have to choose my answer wisely. Wait, what happened to the money? It was the Japanese agency's money anyway, so let's consider it gone. That's too bad. So the mission was to lose both people and money. But we found each other. You're so handsome. Yeon-ja. - Come here. - This is exciting. This feeling of security. Many were sacrificed, but we protected it until the end. So it is indeed "a sweet reward at the end of the road." We should celebrate the fact that we were all in sync and our voices were heard as one. But wait a minute. Where are Comrades Lee and Geum? FALKNER WIND POWER PLANT FLEMING RANCH, PA, USA So this is how it all ends. After all, history is written by winners. Money and brains empower you, not your fist. Too bad for those who aren't aware of that. You mean life is all about deceiving each other? While we take over these U.S. plains, they'll forget about this money.
