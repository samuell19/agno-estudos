Unfortunately, it's a bit too late now. Medical Mechanica is somehow planning on capturing that monster with his mochi, but I don't think it's possible, and the potted plant is missing. Aiko, you were supposed to be our last hope. Who would have guessed that when it came time, I wouldn't be able to bring myself to use you? Take this and get out of here. I don't want it. Just take it! I know you've been saving this money. You were planning to buy your freedom! You may as well take it. It's prize money. There's been a knockout, and the 10 count has already begun.

Perhaps it was something you ate that didn't suit you. Oh, dear. Oh, Mori.Oh, hi, Hibajiri's mom. Goodness. Is this your girlfriend? ♪♪ Okay, Ide! Since you're not home, I'm coming in! Hey, by the way, what do you want from Ide? Well, Hidomi hasn't come home yet. I was hoping she'd be here, maybe. Why would you think she'd be here? I was thinking they were dating, maybe.
