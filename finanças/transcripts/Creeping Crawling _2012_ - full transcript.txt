WHEN HE WAS 15, HE AND SOME FRIENDS WERE SWIMMING. TIMOTHY CLIMBED UP THE ROPE SWING AND DOVE IN. THE WATER WAS LOW THAT SUMMER, AND HE HIT HIS HEAD ON THE BEDROCK. IT COMPRESSED HIS SPINE. THE OTHER CHILDREN, NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO, DRAGGED HIM ONTO THE BEACH AND GOT HIM BREATHING. HE CAN'T MOVE. HIS BRAIN ONLY SUSTAINS HIS LIFE. THAT'S ALL. >> I'M SORRY. I'VE DEALT WITH NON-FATAL HEAD TRAUMA BEFORE, AND IT CAN BE DEVASTATING. >> MM. IF I MAY BE FRANK, MS. McNEIL, BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE AND YOUR REFERENCES, THIS MEETING HAS BEEN MERELY A FORMALITY.

COME ALONG. TIMOTHY. DARLING [SMOOCHES] THIS IS MISS ELIZABETH. SHE'S GOING TO BE STAYING WITH YOU WHILE MOMMY'S IN ENGLAND. >> HI, TIMOTHY. NICE TO MEET YOU. HE LOOKS SO HEALTHY, NOT SICK AT ALL. >> [ SCOFFS ] WELL, HE'S NOT SICK. HE'S SIMPLY BEHIND GLASS. AREN'T YOU, DARLING? NOW, HERE IS A LOG I KEEP OF EVERYTHING I DO FOR MY LITTLE TIMOTHY. I TRY TO KEEP THIS BEDROOM AS NORMAL AS POSSIBLE. HOWEVER, HE DOES HAVE A SPECIAL MATTRESS. IT INFLATES AND DEFLATES TO PREVENT PRESSURE POINTS AND BED SORES. HE STILL MUST BE TURNED EVERY HOUR, BEFORE BEDTIME, AND AFTER HIS MASSAGE. I USUALLY DO IT EVERY THREE SO I CAN SLEEP BETTER. >> [ CHUCKLES ] >> NOW, I WILL CHANGE HIS CATHETER BEFORE I GO. BUT WHEN YOU TURN HIM, GIVE HIM 120 CCs OF WATER AND SWAB HIS MOUTH. I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR THE SKIN. >> I HOPE I CAN DO AS WELL AS YOU. >> I EXPECT, DEAR, THAT YOU COULD DO BETTER. >> OH, YES, OF COURSE. >> OKAY, NOW, YOU'LL BE STAYING IN THE ROOM DOWN THE HALL, WHICH I WILL HAVE SET UP TO ACCOMMODATE YOU ON THE 12th.
