(slow music) - Did I tell you my brother-in-law is coming into town? - [Jack] You did not. - [Esme] Yeah, Eddie's brother, Danny. He's coming to visit Eddie who's in San Fran and he misses me I believe you too, I don't know. Ah, I don't really know, I don't know. - [Jack] What does he do? - He's a filmmaker. It's weird, I mean Eddie and I have been together for so long but I really just don't know his brother. - [Jack] You guys don't get along? - No, we're just not that interested in each other and I wish we were but we're just not. It's just our personalities don't, connect but yeah, he makes films, sometimes porn. - Okay. - I know. That's about all I know. - [Jack] I guess someone's gotta make 'em. - [Esme] Yeah, yup, and he does I guess. Never watched them. (chuckles) - [Jack] Well this'll be good, it'll be time for you guys to bond. - Yeah, yeah I think so. I think, yeah, I think you're right. It'll be good. I guess I'm just thinking, I'm thinking about it too much and it's weird. - He's your husbands brother. - [Esme] Mmhmm. - [Eddie] Are they better now because of it would you say? Are they stronger now? - I don't know maybe. - Like dad went through a time and it was tough right and I remember you whinning about it a little bit but do you think they're better now? - Probably. - Is it because maybe dad came back to his relationship with a new perspective having done that? - Maybe but I'm sure he just realized "This is dumb, why am I doing this?" - Sure, but I mean he wouldn't have come to that realization without having done that, right? I mean you have to... - Yeah, perhaps. - [Eddie] I get it. - [Danny] You have it. As much as you hated dad at that time like I get that now. I'm at a point where I'm sitting across from Esme and I love her to death and I cherish her... - [Danny] Mmmhmm. - But I can feel that and at the same time feel like I kinda wanna kill her as well. - That's wonderful. I would love to stick with somebody and look at across and want to kill them. (chuckles) That would be the best thing in the world. - You don't know what you're talking about. - No, what you have is good. It's great. - You have the single life man. You have the, you can do whatever you want. - I have the lonely single life. At some point, it's just a sad lonely... - [Eddie] You're a cliche. - [Danny] Single man, that's just out there. - [Eddie] You love it, you love it, just own it. Just embrace it, you love it. Don't be one of those... - [Danny] I did, I loved it. - [Eddie] Whiny male contents that's like "Oh I wanna find the right one", oh. - [Danny] But I do. - [Eddie] But you don't. - [Danny] As corny as it sounds I do. - [Eddie] You like the strange ass. - [Danny] The strange ass. (laughs) Who doesn't like strange ass. But at some point, I do want a familiar ass. - And when you get that and you put that through a few years you're gonna wonder what the next step is. Which is why I like right now I feel like a baby would be the next step. - A baby? - A baby. - So you wanna have a baby now. - I do, yeah. - That'd be great. I think you should have a baby. - Yeah, I'd be a great dad. - I'm surprised you haven't had a baby yet. You would be a good dad. - Yeah. Thanks brother. - You're a horrible brother but you'll be a good... - Fuck you man. - But you'll probably be a better dad. - You had to ruin it. (chuckling) It was so nice. I almost loved you for a minute. - Almost. Well you'll love this baby forever. - Yeah. - I think it'll be great and I'll come and visit and spoil it and then go away, with my sad lonely life... - You're gonna hang out with my son, he's gonna end up thinking you're cooler than me. I don't wanna have a baby to fix my problems though, I need to fix my relationship. Does that make sense? Like I have this fear of like continuing on with the same mundane routine with Esme and I love her but like everyday the same thing and I'm afraid like later on, having built up just so many regrets and like, you know what I mean? And then I end up having some kind of meltdown or whatever. However that manifests itself, it's gonna be some, I don't know. - So go ahead, have the meltdown and then come back to her. (chuckles) - [Esme] Hey! - [Danny] How are you? - Look at you! Wow so good to see you. - [Danny] You look good. - [Esme] Wow. - What a sweet display of affection. So sweet, he didn't say "hi" like this to me. Devon, Danny, Danny, Devon. - Very nice to meet you. - Yes. I promised my men here food. - Yes, let's eat, yup. - [Eddie] Thank you so much. - Alright, just grab some beers, okay? - [Devon] Wonderful. - This guys hotel, I went to pick him up and of course you know there's a bunch of regular hotels down the street, around there, just even across the street and he has to stay at the avant garde weird looking, lamps, lamp looks broken like this. (laughing) Lamp shade is like this. Like it's just a fuckin' Andy Warhol nightmare. And he wants to stay there because it's the interesting place right. - [Danny] He loved it. He wanted to stay there so bad. Hey, it's been a long time. I'm glad to see you both. - [Esme] I know it's really really good to see you. - I was expecting to walk on in and see you holding a baby. - Oh. - [Danny] I'm sure mom has been begging for a grandchild. - [Eddie] How does that feel? - Ahh, baby. - [Eddie] How does that feel? Look at that. - [Esme] Yeah, no baby right now. - No. - [Esme] No baby, no, no. - Look how weirded out she is? She's weirded out. - [Esme] Lately too, it's been like, it's been a while. - It's a weekly question but you've never been this nice about it. It bothered you right now. - No, it's just that it's a personal question. - [Eddie] It is a personal question. - And you know... - [Danny] It is. - Yeah, yeah and you know it's just not the right time right now. - She's been busy man. She's going doing a lot... - No I'm sorry if this is... - [Eddie] She's too busy with her work and her projects and her, right? - [Esme] Yeah, yup I've been... - [Eddie] Are we still calling it work? - No, I have been really busy at work actually so that does play a part in it. I've been doing a lot of freelancing with fashion, photography... - [Danny] Great, wonderful! - Yeah, just a lot of stuff but my main focus is graphic design. So I've been doing lots of... - [Eddie] How long have you been doing it? - Unpaid internships and stuff like that and have been working on it for a like almost two years. So, and it's going really well. I'm just trying to build my portfolio and get a lot of stuff in there. - [Danny] Yeah, it's exciting. - Yeah it does but sometimes you have to do a few favors too, you know. - [Eddie] And a lot of unpaid internships, right? - I mean I wouldn't say a lot, I mean there's been some. There are some that pay and some that don't. - [Eddie] Which, how would you... - [Esme] It's pretty like even split. - [Eddie] Is it really? Would you say it's even split? - [Esme] Well, I remember a time when little Eddie was starting off in his career and... - Don't bring that up, it's not the same thing. It does not, it doesn't even compare. - [Esme] It sounds like the same thing. - It does not compare, it does not. It's not the same thing, because I stuck at it. I stuck with it and then it ended up paying. - [Esme] That's what I'm doing though as well. - [Eddie] No it's not, it's like the key phrase here was "stick with it". When you "stick with it" then good things happen. - Sticking with something for almost two year... - [Eddie] I respect that your artistic integrity that you'll do work for free. You know, obviously I get that, you guys are artistic or whatever I don't know, but... - [Esme] So what is, what is the... - The problem is that some of it like... - [Esme] For the past two years... - Let's say, I mean they ask you a question, how was, well he didn't ask how does it work is but let's tell him about work. Let's see how it's going. She takes on some work that pays, most work doesn't pay, meanwhile we have bills and got stuff. - [Esme] The work that doesn't pay is what I'm working towards for having my career. - Sure but you have to work at it for a while though right? I mean let's just, let's say it. - I don't think I need to go into my entire financial situation with your brother who I haven't seen in, I don't even know how long. - [Eddie] Okay but I'm saying, okay, all I'm saying, okay like so, let's paint the full picture. - Eddie let it go, just let it go. - [Eddie] No let's paint the full picture there. It's not like you've never seen us talk about this. Let's talk about it. - [Esme] Yeah let's paint the picture. I'm working at... - [Eddie] Right now you're doing in graphic design right? And you've been doing that for a little bit, yeah? - Okay... - [Eddie] And then you were... - [Esme] Two years, yes. - [Eddie] Okay good. - [Esme] Two years yes, not a little bit. - [Eddie] Okay. - [Esme] You make it sound like it's been five months. - [Eddie] But if you don't start seeing some money within two years don't you think it's that's it, kind of? - But I have, I have... - [Eddie] Maybe you should just find a regular job or do you have to be... - I have been seeing money though, that's what you're missing. - Okay but enough, enough to be... - You're just not paying... - So I don't feel like I'm carrying you? - You're focusing on the unpaid work and not the paid work because that's what you would prefer to do. - I pick the fuckin' thing, I pick the thing that pays and that's like, it's bringing money back and it's comfortable and we could live comfortably... - Sure I would love it. - So you could explore your, you know, your weekly fevers or your dogmanship. - [Esme] I do recall it, I do recall a time when you were starting out... - [Eddie] So yeah in my video game, when I started off in that there was a transitional period, sure. I was doing some stuff for free because I also needed to kind of build a reputation and whatever and then I started getting gigs and then I started getting paid and now I'm getting paid more money and now like, the only changes then are... - Yeah, yeah, you did that and that's exactly what I'm doing right now. - [Eddie] Okay, but you have to stick to it. Yeah but you go from one thing to another thing. Before this it was fashion, yeah? - It's not that I'm... - [Eddie] So it's graphic design now, fashion before... - I'm picking that up so I can have money coming in. - I think you were a fuckin' mime before that, right? - I'm not... - [Eddie] Okay, yeah and then what was it before? Then she was a street performer and then you were doing other things. Obviously I was joking about the mime thing but you guys know that she wasn't a mime. (sighs) I'll fixate on some small, ridiculously small issue, semantics, the way she says something. Sometimes, I don't know, I don't know just, escalate and then one of us loses it. - That's been happening a lot. That's it? - I honestly don't know what's gonna happen. - Yeah. - Well I don't know how much I'm trying to (mumbles). - [Danny] I'm hoping for the best but you're good. Don't beat yourself over it. - Alright. (chuckles) I'm sorry, so anyway, yeah. - And I see, look who's awkward now. - [Eddie] Yeah. - [Danny] Yeah. - [Eddie] I'm alright, (mumbles) is not gonna judge me. Okay, now that, so let me make it up to you by asking you for a favor. - Oh yeah. - Can you take this Mexican home? - Oh yeah. - [Eddie] Yeah? - He'll fit nicely in the truck. (laughing) (slow music) - [Danny] You should be out there surfing. I don't know why you're not doing this. - [Eddie] It's just too manly for me. (chuckles) I can't do that, it's too cool for me. - [Danny] You'd rather just sit here and watch. - I'd rather just sit her and fuckin' punch you. (laughing) Don't fuckin' question my manhood. - [Danny] Ah you got me. - Shut the fuck up. - I'm just fuckin' around. - Don't, don't, I don't wanna get all full of sand. (screams and laughs) Son of a fuckin'... This is my turf, this is my turf. Dude don't fuck... - This is your turf? - Dude don't fuckin' do it. I will not fuckin', I will gay bash you. Oh my gosh my gum! (laughing) I lost my... (laughing) Damn it, fuckin'! - [Danny] Uncle, uncle. - He's not here dude. And it's Thio. - [Danny] Gimme my hat. - [Eddie] Here. - [Danny] Now I got sand in my mouth. - I'm done watching this fuckin' asshole surf. - [Danny] Oh my God. - [Eddie] Oh fuck. - [Danny] So what's his deal? What can you tell me about him? - He's a surfer. I think he's what Europeans think they're gonna see more of when they come over here. - Really? - Yeah. Instead they see us. - Is he on Tinder or Grindr? - Yeah, I don't know what that means. (laughs) - That's right, you shouldn't. - [Eddie] What is that? - [Danny] You're an old married man. (chuckles) - [Eddie] How do we call... This is ridiculous, how do we call him in? - [Danny] I don't know. - [Eddie] And does he have any consideration? Like are we, you know... - No, he's in his... - Cowabunga bullshit. - He is. It's part of his charm. - I'm done. - [Danny] Part of his allure. - I'm gonna go. He's not experiencing this. Dude, we're not out there. We're getting sand in our fuckin' stupid faces and he's surfing. Every chic here wants to fuck him. (laughs) And I'm here hanging out with you. - [Danny] That's right. (slow music) ("Flying Forver" by Ben Scott-Brandt) - You need help? - I think I got it, thank you though. - [Eddie] So what do you do, just ride that? - Yeah. - [Eddie] Okay. - That's pretty much it. - [Danny] Listen I'm good. I'm gonna go with him. - Yeah? - [Devon] Yeah, I'll take him home. - Alright, okay, bye. - [Danny] So what now? - Get in the car. I'll finish this. For real, I got it. ("Flying Forever" by Ben Scott-Brandt) (attempting to make a sexy sound) - So you don't like it? Just let yourself look, just look. Look at that. God if I were you I'd wanna bang me all the time. Look at this. Someone overcooked this. Look at that, how about that? Is that sexy? No? (chuckles) How's this? You come home from work one day and I'm standing like this. Hey. Whatever. I'm turning myself on. The way I did, like the way girls put on their... Do you like it? You didn't like it. (sighs) You don't think I'm funny. You want me now because of the dancing. - [Esme] Mmhmm. - [Eddie] You do, you're damn right you do. I want me. (laughing) - [Esme] That's just too much. - So a friend of mine was watching one of my films and she was like "Danny I'm noticing that "all these guys in your films are, "is very hyper masculine type of guys you know. "Take charge, kind of heroic type of men." - [Esme] Kind of like your dad? - Like, wow nobody's ever said, wow that's like nice... - Right though? - [Danny] Observation. - I've gotten that before man. I've gotten that a couple of times. - [Danny] Have you? - That I'm kind of like dad, yeah. I'm not, I totally sound like "Well I got that a couple of times". (laughing) But I have, I have. 'Cause he's a masculine dude. He's a sexy guy, debonair... - [Danny] But no, no one has ever said that. - Very masculine, masculine is good. - I don't know, I don't really see that. I see more as macho. - [Danny] A macho? - Yeah, don't you? - What do you mean? What's the, what do you mean? Isn't that a bad thing? A macho? - Oh my God, no it's not a bad thing. I just see you more as like a macho guy and your dad is more masculine, just very like shoulders back, confident. Oh my God. It's not a bad thing. - [Eddie] No, no no. - [Esme] I was just making an observation. - Eddie, is this not you? Are you not this... - [Eddie] No, I don't know, I thought I was kind of... - That was always the problem though with your mom and your dad though, that he was too masculine, right? - I have work, I'm gonna go work in the other room. (Danny humming) - Or am I wrong? I don't know, maybe. - [Danny] There's a lot... - I thought I heard that, maybe that he was just too much, or is, no? - I'm sorry, I feel like I'm always catching you guys at a bad time. - [Esme] No everything, everything is fine. I was just asking, I thought that was maybe one of the things that your mom and dad had problems with. Or not. - Umm, here you go. - [Esme] Oh thanks. - No, thank you, that was great. It was a great meal. I don't know if... You probably know, I'm sure Eddie told you about the whole you know, our parents were going through a tough time and they were fighting and I wasn't dealing with it really well. I mean, I don't know how Eddie really was but I know for me it was really hard. I was happy when they got back together. - [Esme] Do you wanna have a beer? - A beer? I think women are more fluid in their sexuality and it's a shame that men, more men are not open to those experiences. - Yeah. Yeah, I mean I know it's like a bold statement but I just don't, like when guys say they're bi-sexual I just don't think that they are. - [Danny] No. - I think they're just, they say it because they're not comfortable being completely out but they're just gay. And they say "Oh I'm bi-sexual" so it's easier for, you know, for me to tell my mom. (laughing) - Yeah, that's true. So tell me this, even though I know it's gonna be personal and you are my brothers wife, but have you, Esme, had a fluid sexual experience with a woman? - Not a relationship but I've... - But have you been intimate with a woman? - Mmhmm. - Wow, does Eddie know about this? - Yeah, I mean, it's one of those things when you're young and you're drunk. - So when you were younger? You never think in your adulthood, before you met Eddie, you never, there was never a moment where you met some woman and you had a sexual intimate experience? Where you were just there, laying in bed, just intimate, cuddling, kissing, holding hands? - I mean, it's just been that, but it hasn't gone into a relationship. - Wow. - But I think... - And you never thought that you were gay? You never thought "Oh maybe I'm a lesbian!"? - No. - [Danny] Why? - I think I'm, I'm straight. I've had that experience but I'm straight because it's not consistent. It's not a consistent feeling that I have. - [Danny] Why? Why, do you feel like you have stopped yourself from exploring that more? - [Esme] No I didn't stop myself from anything. - [Danny] Eddie was just that good. (laughing) He was the end all, be all. He say you know what, you have the, the magic dick. (laughing) And no pussy can compete. (laughing) (slow dramatic music) - Hey, it's me. Just calling to say "hi" and see how you are. I can't wait to see you. It's just, I can't go this long without being with you. I can't wait to be in our little home together. We're gonna be so happy together. And I want you to know that. That I just need you to know how excited I am to be with you. Okay. I'll see you soon. - [Jack] So we're really gonna do this again? - Whatever. - It's not true. - I know. I don't like doing this to you. - It's okay. - No, it's not okay. - You got things to do. Things to take care of. - No, I don't really. - Yes you do. - [Esme] I don't know what you're talking about. - Let's not talk about it. (slow music) - Hey Eddie, it's me Danny. I'm outside your house so, hopefully you'll be here soon or whatever. But yeah, don't worry about it. Hey, how's it going? - [Devon] Hey. - I was suppose to meet Eddie but... - [Devon] Yeah, he texted me. - Oh nice. (chuckles) I'm guessing he's not gonna be here. - [Devon] No he's not but I am, so... - Nice. - I thought we could go out. - [Danny] I don't think I ever had any boy take me to the beach. There's only one, only one beach memory I have. - [Devon] Yeah? - [Danny] And I was thinking about it today when we were walking around. I think I was like 10. And I was with my friend Ben and it was summer and we were walking on the beach and it was at night time so there was like no light out. It was just dark and we were just falling over each other, trying to find the ocean. And we did, and once we did we were too afraid to go inside because it was dark and loud and we both didn't know how to swim. But he held my hand and we went in anyways. And we didn't drown. - [Devon] That's good. - [Danny] Is that where you take your dates? To the beach? - [Devon] Sometimes. Yeah sometimes. - [Danny] And what do you guys do? - Same things, walk around and see the sights. Should we go back to your hotel? - Yeah, if you want to? - Yeah I think so. - So I have these models, so they come in, I'm looking outside the room, I'm seeing all these models and I'm like "Great, I don't even know which one of these models "can really act or perform on camera "and not be dumb." But I guess that's the gamble you take when you're making these types of films. - [Devon] I would imagine so. - Yeah, definitely. - So, any projects lately? Have you found any models? - [Danny] Yes. I have not. - So you're looking? - It's something I'm avoiding to do because it's very taxing. - Looking for models is taxing? - [Danny] Yes, it's a lot of hard work. Not everybody can do this you know. It's not just... You can't call your grandpa over and say "Hey". - Well I would hope not. My grandpa is 90 years old so I don't he would be modeling for you any time soon. (laughing) - [Danny] No. - [Devon] What? If you're looking I mean... - What are you saying? You're one of these models? - I mean, paycheck sounds pretty good. - [Danny] I don't know. You really, I don't know, I'm not getting the vibe from you. I'm not getting that big personality, seductive... - You're not getting that vibe? - [Danny] Type of, you know sex craved maniac. - [Devon] Sex craved maniac? That's what you need? - That's what it takes you know. I need the real deal. - [Devon] The real deal. - And sometimes actors have that in them. Maybe a model or two but... For the most part I think if you're just that person already, it makes it much easier. - Okay. - [Danny] Uh-oh, oh no. Is this how you're auditioning for me? - [Devon] I don't know. - Because you know right now I should have a camera, if I'm gonna have you audition I should record you. I should have you on film. - [Devon] Get the camera. - No. - [Devon] Why not? - I don't know if I wanna record this. - [Devon] Why not? - [Danny] Why don't I, I mean let's do a screening first. So who, what... Hello, nice to meet you, how are you sir? - [Devon] I'm good, how are you? - I'm good, this is quite funny. (laughing) This is, but I don't know, look at you, you're... - [Devon] What? - You've maybe got something, I don't know. I don't know yet. You're kinda hard to read. - [Devon] Oh am I? You're pretty easy to read right now. - [Danny] Oh am I? - You're losing your hat, you nervous? - [Danny] Well yeah. You're making me a little nervous but no, in all seriousness. If you were to be one of these guys, let's see. First of all I would have, you know, a couple of buttons undone, 'cause they're trying to show a little skin, trying to grab my attention, showing off the chest. Look at that, nice. You know, they kinda, the hair has a little toss, tousled to the side, you know looking crazy. - [Devon] Mmhmm. - I don't know. You might be a little too clean cut for me. - Too clean cut? - Yes. - [Devon] Mmm. - Well definitely don't wear glasses 'cause you know, eye contact is always good. Gotta have that. It's what makes it sexy. (chuckles) So yeah, that's pretty much it. They come on in and show their stuff and kind of try to impress me in some way. - What happens after that? - Well, I give them a piece of paper with a couple of instructions and a little scene to read. - Mmhmm. What happens then? - What happens next is... I get ready for bed because it's been, it's been a really long night and I'm quite tired. But thank you for spending the time with me and having fun. (slow music) - Jack, what if I told you I wasn't bi-sexual? - That's fine. - Really? Why, that's not weird at all? - No. I don't think so. I just don't, I don't think I am. I think I feel a certain way about you but I think that's it. I don't think I feel that way about any other woman, which I know is a good thing for you. (laughs) But... - [Jack] I appreciate that, I think. - Yeah. But is that weird? That I don't think I could see myself falling in love with another woman? I am un-attracted to women. - Well, what made you notice me? - A lot of things but I was just drawn to you. The way you are, it had very little to do with the fact that you're a woman. It probably had nothing to do with the fact that you're a woman. - So then you're not. I think you're thinking about it too much. You like who you like and that's it. - Yeah. There was a camp counselor once. (chuckles) But that was the only other person. - Tell me about the camp counselor. - It was the same thing. I didn't, it wasn't like, "Oh she's a hot girl", she wasn't really. She was just like fleece wearing, birkenstock, kind of like bad short hair, just wasn't, she wasn't like really physically attractive but I just was so drawn to her. I even secretly took a picture of her when we got on the bus to leave. I took a picture of her on my disposable camera. I made it seem like I was taking a picture of a group of people but I really was just taking it so I could have a picture of her. So weird. But that was the last time I felt that way about a woman. - So am I a step up? - Yes, you have good short hair. - Thank you. - And you don't wear fleece. Well as long as you don't think it's weird. - I don't. (clears throat) Let me try that again, I don't. (laughing) (message alert) (water running) (phone ringing) - Hello. Hey. Oh I'm sorry. No I'm just working late. Oh. (mumbles) Oh I'm sorry. Well how about (mumbles) when I get home. It will still be just as nice. Okay, that sounds good. Yup, yup, I'll text you when I'm leaving. Alright. Love you too. Bye. - If you love him, I want you to be with him. I can't keep doing this and neither can you. Say something. ("Five Miles Long (There's A Place)" by Ben Scott-Brandt) - Do you remember when our bunny got really sick when we were driving from New York to LA? I think it was when you were driving through Colorado and it was the altitude that did it and she just could not handle it. And she was so so frail and I just remember looking at you and you looked so worried. And I've never loved you more. Eddie I need you to go. - Hey, it's me Danny. (knocking) - It's been hard. The city is, it can be lonely. And you know, what's weird about it is when I first moved here, it was a lonely place, obviously I didn't know anyone. But you know, there was a pain that went with the loneliness 'cause you miss everyone from back home. You're out here long enough and it just goes away. There's no more pain anymore, it's just you and you just kinda get use to the loneliness. So, if anything I miss the pain. (light chuckle) - It sounds very sad, very depressing. - Well there's always Tinder. (sighs) (slow music) - Hey, hello. I really, I would love to see you. I would love to come home. I would love to dance for you. We've gone through a lot of stuff man, I'm tired and I love you. We're married and that's grown up shit and you should let me come home and talk to you. I think we're jumping the gun too quickly on this thing, this calling it quits thing. That's what losers do, that's what quitters do and I'm not a quitter, and you're not a quitter. And, I love you Esme and please listen to, I'm so afraid you're gonna listen to this voicemail and you're just gonna cut it off halfway through 'cause then you won't be hearing this stuff and this is the good stuff. Alright, I love you and please, please let me come home. I'm really, really tired. And let's fix things, bye. (sighs) I had a buddy that use to come over when we were small. I mean, I don't know, 12, 13 or something. I know my dad had like three VHS pornos and I know where they had them stashed and he'd come over, everyone was gone, we'd go in and there was just the one VCR in the house. So we'd pop in the, you know, one of them. Our favorite was the chameleon. (chuckles) - The chameleon? - Shut up. (laughs) And then we would watch it and then we'd start getting horny in like 10 seconds and we had to find some way to like, it was weird. That was like the first time that like there was a little bit of this. Like I feel like there's something we have to discuss. Like who's gonna, I need to jerk off righ now and I know you do too, so who's gonna, are you gonna go to the bathroom or are you gonna leave me in here for a little bit and then we can switch or something. Eventually we did this so many times, he kept on coming over and we'd watch the movie that we just agreed that you know, I don't care man, you lay there, I'll sit over here and we'll just, we'll watch the video and we'll jerk off in the same room. And it was weird, it was like sex, it was so sexual and I was doing something sexual in a room with a friend but it wasn't you know, contact or anything, so. Yeah. Are you gay dude or what? (light chuckle) (sighs heavily) - Fuck. - Too blunt? - No. I just don't know how to answer you. - Danny's a great guy. - Yeah. - I'm a better guy but he's a pretty fuckin' good guy man. (laughs) And I love him and you're a good guy. - [Devon] Yeah. - And it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. - [Devon] I know. I don't know. I don't really know what I'm feeling. If I had an answer, I would, I would love to have an answer. This isn't easy, I don't know. I don't know what to tell you. I don't really know, I can't even get along with the voices in my own head. So to give you an answer right now would be ridiculous because I don't know what I'm feeling. Confused as fuck. This city has just worn me out man. Your brother's been great. Part of me thinks that maybe I'm just reaching for someone so I'm not lonely anymore. Part of me thinks maybe, maybe I am. I don't, I don't know. - [Eddie] Relationships are complex, I get it. - [Devon] They are. - [Eddie] I totally get it, yeah. - [Devon] They are, they are. - [Eddie] I've seen dudes that I'm sometimes like "Hey, that guy is..." - Yup. - [Eddie] You know? - I know. (slow music) (sighs) - I don't know where it happened. You know I can, I can remember that time when we were both in love with each other. And I remember how it felt and then it just seemed really really far away. I can even remember feeling in love with him but him not. I could tell he wasn't in love with me and then vice versa. But I don't, I don't think any one thing happened, it just... - Are you having an affair? Who is he? - [Esme] Hey boys. - [Danny] Hello. - [Devon] Hello. - [Esme] Welcome to my film set. - Awesome, wow. Is this your first time doing this? - Yeah, camera. Ah, you know, a dabble here and there. (laughing) - [Danny] Oh I don't wanna see those videos. (laughing) - No you don't. (laughing)0 You guys look really nice together on camera. - Yeah? - [Esme] Yeah, very nice. Danny is it weird being in front of the camera? - It is, I don't like it at all. - Would you like it more if Devon took his shirt off? - [Danny] Would I like it more, would that what make me more comfortable? - Yeah, would that make you more comfortable? - [Danny] Maybe if he had his shirt off? (chuckles) - [Esme] Knowing... - Or seeing that he has a shirt off. - [Esme] Seeing and knowing and everythign. (laughing) - Ah no, I don't know, I don't know. - [Esme] Devon jump in here, what do you think? - I can take the shirt off. - [Esme] Yeah. - [Devon] I can do it. - [Danny] Wow. - [Esme] Yeah, you've seen me take a shirt off before. - I can (mumbles) for this. I can do that. - I haven't prepared for this. He's ready, well I could do this. (laughing) - [Esme] There he goes. - This is the actual we're dealing with here. - [Esme] Yup. Oh yeah, that's good. Perfect and the hair is tousled and beautiful. - Dude, I'm ready. - Gosh, nice body. That's not professional. Sorry, I'm the director, I should not be saying that. I'm sorry. - [Danny] Yes, you have to separate your feelings. - Yup, separate. - [Danny] From the actor. - Okay. My next direction, on your knees. Up. - Up! - [Devon] I'm ready. - Both of you. - [Danny] Alright. - [Devon] Alright. - Okay? - So we're on the... - [Esme] Okay. - Whoa, do not spill. - [Esme] Okay, let's calm down now. Okay, okay, I thought there was water in there. (laughing) Alright, okay, so now guys when I said on your knees I didn't mean facing me. - Not facing you? - [Esme] Face each other. Yeah, no, what are you talking about? - Oh, just be more specific. - [Esme] This is a film, why would you be looking... Yeah, no, face each other. - On the ol' knees, facing each other. - Come on, let's move it along. Time is money, time is money. - [Danny] I don't know if I've done this before, this pose into any of my films. - Oh okay, well now I'm doing it. This is my idea, my vision Danny. - [Danny] You're the boss. (chuckles) - Alright, now I think to move forward with the story, I think we need you to kiss on the lips. - Kiss, oh my, wow. Those are strong demands. - Yeah. - Right. - Those are my demands. Yup, do we need to... - Um, yeah I don't, I don't... Can you stop for a second? Just stop. - [Esme] Okay, we're not... Okay. - Sorry, I'm just, I'm not. (laughing) - We're not, no? - [Devon] Yeah I'm sorry guys. - Okay. (slow music) - Well, you've over stayed your welcome. You've emasculated me with your beard. I never got to hang out with you. - No, you're horrible. - I know, yeah. - You're a horrible host. - Yeah, we didn't go play catch in the park or anything. - You don't know how to play catch. - So I lob it like a girl. (chuckles) Can I give you a piece of advice man? - No. - I am your older brother, it's an obligation. - Go ahead. - Okay, and I don't mean any offense by it, I just wanna give you, I wanna tell you that, you know you said before that you, I don't know, that you've always wanted to have what I have like a committed relationship, a comfortable relationship. I don't know if you meant it but it's work, you know what I mean? You know the falling in love is the easy part but then you have to work at it, yeah. There's gonna be the, eventually you're gonna feel much more of the difficulty of like two heads budding in a close space, you know? And it becomes very un-sexy. But if you stick with it, I mean it can also be a very beautiful thing. - Yeah. - But you gotta commit to it. - I do. - Go into it wholeheartedly. - Yes, I need to start doing that more. - Yeah. - See, you taught me something. - There you go. - Who would've thought. - (mumbles) for it to actually go through your thick fuckin' head. I have something else. Look at mom and dad, they were able to, they did it, they stuck to it and you liked that. When they got back together, that was great, yeah. We stopped talking for a little bit but they got back together and that was... They did that because you stick to it, you just gotta... - Yeah. Well hopefully it will happen to me. - Okay. - I'm open to it. (Danny mumbling) Hold on to the table once. - [Eddie] What are you doing? You don't know anything. Just give me your hand. - But look, if I do this, in my arms, look how it's... How am I gonna pin you when my arm is not... - [Eddie] No, in over the top they do, it's like this and then you plant your elbow. - [Danny] It is. - [Eddie] Okay, when we go this way, if I lose, (light bangin), you'll hear that. (Danny mumbles) I know this. Here we go. - Are you ready? And... (Eddie mumbles) - [Danny] I still have a... Uncle, uncle. - [Eddie] Shit. - [Danny] Fuck it, brother, brother. (groans) Okay. Hey! - [Eddie] Listen to me, listen to me, are you listening to me? - [Danny] No. - [Eddie] Listen to me. - [Danny] What? - [Eddie] Don't be an asshole man. The next time there's drama, mom and dad, or with you, we don't lose touch, we don't lose communication. - [Danny] Or what? - [Eddie] I'm gonna slap your gay face. - [Danny] Okay. (laughing) (groans) - [Eddie] Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Do you agree or not? Yes or no? - [Danny] Do I agree? - [Eddie] Is this... - I don't know. - 'Cause then you're gonna be missing out a lot more of this. - [Danny] I don't care. - This is gayer than any of your films. - [Danny] Is it? Listen, I agree. - [Eddie] You promise? I'm glad you were, I'm glad you came over man. I'm sorry I didn't spend a lot of time with you. - [Danny] It's alright, don't let it happen again. Come on get up. - [Eddie} Oh fuckin'. Pulled me around like a fuckin' dog. - You're good, you're good. I love you brother. - [Eddie] I love you. - Take care of each other, okay? - Yeah, okay. - Don't fuck up. Hey. What's up? - [Devon] Hey. - How's it going? - It's alright. - Get some sleep? - Yeah, not really. (chuckles nervously) - Look, I'm sorry about last night. - No, don't, please don't you apologize. I, that's me, I don't know what I was doing. It was fine, I should've just... - I can see you better. Thank you. I'll see you around. ("Flying Forever" by Ben Scott-Brandt) - So what do you think, we should just move in? - Yeah. I was thinking tomorrow that you would go to the front desk and just explain to them. - Right I will, I will do that. - Cool. - Just tell them that we've decided that we approve of their sheets and everything in... - Keep the detergent. - Keep the detergent and we'll be here, and we'll be here for good. - Yup. - And um... - We're not gonna pay anything. - We're not gonna pay anything, no. We have specific demands that have to be met. - Yup. This side, we have to be on this side for the view. - Right, right, right, but we won't be giving them any sort of money for any of it. - No, no. - I can't see any problems with that, I think. - No, I think that's great but you have to be the one to talk to them because you're really good with them. - Yes, yes, no I will. - I'll stand behind you and smile. - First thing in the morning, we'll go down and take care of it. - First thing in the morning and then we'll be all set. - [Jack] This feels good.
