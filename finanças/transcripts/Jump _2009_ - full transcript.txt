The lyre is finely played, big cuz The shoes are finely embroidered Little cuz lt's good fun, so much fun Real good fun Hey ho, hey ho, hey ho, hey ho The full moon falls on the 15th But boys and girls fall For each other tonight Yeah, yeah, yeah Here you are! Good to see you all. Come inside. My good friends... ...thanks to your faith in me... ...I've been a success in the city. I'm now recruiting staff for my factory. But instead oftaking on strangers... ...I'd rather employ people I know. That's why I'm here... ...to see if anyone wants to come work for me. I only have 10 openings, mind. But if anyone is interested, put up your hand. Really? So many of you? Let's think of a way to do this fairly. -Don't want any hard feelings, right? -Right! The main thing is no matter who's chosen... ...we remain friends. Right? Right! It's mine! It's mine! Phoenix! Got it! The cock is crowing Rise and shine, and let's get busy The girls are transplanting seedlings ln the field -Dinner. -Let's eat. My darling girl. Sure you want to move to the city? All those people. And the traffic! It's a dangerous world, Dad! You can come back anytime you like. There's no shortage of good-lookers here. Here's a drumstick. Eat up! Be my guest. You take this! I'll help myself! Eat the butt. I've had enough! Do we have to do that stupid routine every time we eat? It's not stupid. It's about training your reflexes. You might need to defend yourself one day. Can't you understand that? Ever since I was small, all these kung fu moves. Tai-chi, Wing-tsun, the One Point Power Finger. I just can't see the point. Kung fu's boring. But you do love to dance. Dancing's totally different. No! They walk hand-in-hand. Dancing and kung fu come from the same place. Never mind. Since your mom died, I'm the only man in the family. Kung fu's all I can teach you. Speaking of Mom, where's that floral skirt she left me? It was far too short. I threw it away. What? Look into my eyes. It never fails to work. No one can fool me when I look in their eyes. Dad. Please don't worry. You'll need money when you get to the city. This is my life's savings. It's six or seven hundred dollars. Take it. It's too much! Don't fuss about it. It was meant for your dowry. Don't throw it away. And don't blame me if no one will marry you! Dad! If you have any worries, write me at once... ...and I'll come to rescue you. Write? This is what they use in the city. It's a portable cassette tape recorder. Very high-tech. And this is a cassette tape. It works just like the one by your bed. You put it in and press the button. This way, you'll know what I'm up to. So I can stop worrying now? Hey, what's the matter? What's up? Look! A shooting star! I'm wishing I'll get rich in the city. No, wait. I want longer legs... ...smaller waist, bigger boobs. No, no. I want to find my perfect man. That's my wish. Whatever. I made those wishes. Really thought they'd come true. But I'm still stuck here. If only I could get to the city, I'd definitely be a success. I will make it somehow! Oh, you're pissed you're not going to the city? Yeah. Here. Have this. Letter of Employment But what about you? Forget the work. I just want to go to the city. Phoenix, you're a pal! You're so great! But how will you live without a job? No worries. I'll work hard on becoming a celebrity. Then I'll be able to look after you. Let's go to the city! City! Here we come! Snow! Snow! Snow! Snow! Where were you? What's that? Of course. Okay. Just trust me! Don't mention it. It was my pleasure. Goodbye! That's me in the photographs. Girls wouldn't look at me before... ...but I don't have that problem now. Now, let's get down to business. What can I do for you? Breastjob. Facelift. All pretty routine. How much does it cost? Not much. Around-- Around $200,000. I don't have that. Can you do it any cheaper? I graduated from Harvard. That's why I charge more than the others. I understand your problem. But I'm worth it. Is it safe? Are there side effects? Will it look real? Will things fall off? No, of course not. I'm a Harvard man. It'll be fine! Damn! It keeps falling off. That's it, take it easy. One at a time. Move down the bus! Did you catch it offthe doctor? I have no idea. -Thanks. -Okay. Here's the address. Don't wander too far. Make sure you get back tonight. -I understand. -Be careful! -Goodbye. -Bye! Nice moves! Well, I am a dancer. In my village dance group. I can tell. Actually, I'm a talent scout. What's that? It doesn't matter. The point is, do you want to be a great dancer? Yes, I do! Then you should enter the street-dance competition. How do I do that? First off, you need a manager. That's me. You've got potential. I guarantee you'll make it! Why are you staring at me? Is it because I look rather Eurasian? I'm trying to tell if you're lying. Why would I lie? Do you have $1000 on you? Nope. Why would I try to cheat you out of money you don't have? How much do you have? Just over $500. -Had enough? -Yes! About time. Let me help you enroll for the competition. Where's your $500? I don't have it. I thought you said you had $500. I have. My friend's got it. How are we going to get it? I'll ask her for it. Where is your friend? She's working in a factory in Song Jiang. So who's paying for this food? I haven't any money. Why don't you go get it from her? How long does it take to walk to Song Jiang? About two days. What about taking a car? I haven't any money! Thank you, sir! Hey! What do you want? I'm looking for someone. Can't you read? "No visitors during working hours." But it's after hours now. "No visitors after working hours." Please let me in, sir. It's urgent! Can't do that. Please, sir! Please! Who's that? Why are you so late? That was a close shave! Running into a bad guy on her first day in town. You have to be careful with these city people. What do you mean, "bad guy"? He bought me lunch and gave me bus money. Where did you get all the luck? Even if he isn't a real talent scout, I know I want to-- Why are you standing around like lame ducks? Want me to shoot you all in the ass? Whoa, instant coffee. You people know how to treat yourselves. Make me a cup. -There's no hot water. -So boil some! It smells like shit in here. Don't you ever wash your clothes? Coffee's ready. I can't hold it in anymore. I must sing! We live in the country, yeah We go to town to work, yeah We make some money And bring it home, yeah To give it to Dad and Mom, yeah What's with you crazy peasants? Singing in the middle of the night! -Is this what you do in the country? -Here's your coffee. Go to bed. What were you saying? I just want to dance! Sure. I'll let him know. Your girlfriend left her earrings at your place. She's not my girlfriend. Why are you here so often, boss? You're so busy. Can't you delegate this? After all, it's only a dance school. I agree the dance school isn't profitable. But it creates a good image for our brand. And it provides important publicity. We need to expand the business into the youth market. So the cost doesn't worry me. Grace is on the line from Shanghai. -Sorry, he's in a meeting. -Get Samuel on the line. Samuel. How's it going? Don't worry. Everything's fine. The Challenge the World street-dance championship is coming up. The best of our students are here. Would you have time to stop by and say hello? They'd love to see you. That's all right. You say hello for me. I have to go now. Miss Chang has arrived. She's downstairs. Your keys. What? Two thousand dollars a month for dance classes! And a beginner's session is $150. It's too much! I shopped around. They all charge the same. Hold it right there! You think this is a hotel? Do you think I'm blind? Which one of you girls isn't from the country? Which one of you isn't poor as a church mouse? Which one of you doesn't have a sick father and a mother in need of surgery? Which one of you hasn't a dream with no hope of realizing it? What makes you any different from them? If you want a meal ticket, forget it! There's no such thing as a free lunch. You want food, you earn it. Get to bed. Works starts early tomorrow. You want me to work for you? -You want in? -Yes! What morons! Dad! Don't you worry about me. l've found my dream here. Everything's fine. Okay. Till next time. -Bye! -Bye! It's getting cold. Wrap up warm. And be careful when you go out. There are bad people out there. You here for dance lessons too? You're a man. What's with the earring? What kind of a man wouldn't lift a finger? No help with the coins. You're not a gentleman. Thanks. Boss! Excuse me, where--? It's the back door for the cleaning job. Don't bother us. Cleaning job? What? You're cleaning toilets? I'll be in charge of everything, including toilets. Same thing. Right! You're cleaning other people's toilets... ...for only $400 a month. I can learn to dance and still have $400 clear. You have a day job. You clean toilets at night. And pick up dance steps along the way. You'll break your back. I don't have a problem with that. Aren't you worried what the fat lady foreman will do if she finds out? I used to sneak in before. I don't care! I want to dance. I want to jump up and touch the stars! Are you nuts? Is this for an octopus? Five, six, seven, eight. One.... Left. How long have you been learning to dance? Not now! I'm in a hurry. No problem! Look! It's the boss again. He's got a nice face, hasn't he? That's not the point. He's only 28... ...and he's already in the "100 Most Influential" list. You shouldn'tjudge people by their looks. Good looks are just as important as power. He's never even glanced at you. And he's a terrible playboy. I don't like that about him. I don't like that about him either. You should watch out. He might fall for you! So what? I'm only a cleaning lady, but if a man doesn't love me with all his heart... ...then don't bother, even if you're Tom Cruise. Not to mention him. It's rare to find a girl of principles. You'd have a better chance if you lost the hair on your upper lip. What? What are you laughing at? She thinks one of the most influential men in the country would fall for her. Let's call it a day. Go home and practice to the music, okay? What are you doing? Don't touch my stuff! I didn't mean to. I have the same thing back home, exactly the same as yours. This is worth over $1000. Do you have that in your village? Wow, a thousand dollars? Then you got ripped off. Really! Forget it! Don't mind her. She's just a peasant. What does she know? You got ripped off. Excuse me. I'm in a hurry. Dad, l haven't talked to you in a while. l have a wonderful thing to tell you. I've found a job, cleaning toilets in a dance school. And I've taped a very popular song from school for you. We'll see about that. It's only the cleaning lady. Let's go. Hey! It's time to go. Boss! Awesome! I never knew there were so many beautiful girls in your company! Which one do you think is the most beautiful? The one in red. I think the one in yellow is more beautiful. I think so too. What do you think, Ron? -Go on. -Tell us, Ron. Which one? If I really had to choose, I'd say the one in gray. Gray? No one's wearing gray. The one mopping the floor is in gray. But she's only the cleaner. Well, you did ask me. Can't a cleaning lady be beautiful? Look! A peasant girl dancing. You look so silly! Where are you going? Come back. Where are you going? Dance! Where have you been? At dance class. Kids with dreams, they're a dime a dozen. You should face reality. You're in no position to dream. You won't compromise, you have no money... ...and you're not pretty. You don't even do your factory job well. You peasant girls don't know crap. You need to be practical and work hard when you come to the city. Dreaming won't put food on the table. Reality is tough. Think about what I'm saying. It's a jungle out there. Take this. You peasant girls don't know crap. You need to be practical and work hard when you come to the city. Dreaming won't put food on the table. How are you? Is this why you're always rushing? Because you come over here to dance every day? That's right. I haven't seen you dance lately. You dance well. I have to go now. Not everyone has the talent to dance. I know I'm not gifted... ...but I love to dance so much that I just carry on. You have what it takes. Don't give up! Coming! May I? Come! Dad, something bad happened recently. lt almost made me give up my dream. lt's so easy to give up. Having the courage to carry on is harder. But l know now what l should do. Nothing is impossible, as long as l believe in myself. Dad, l'm not a child anymore. l'll work hard and do myjob well. And l'll fight for my dream. Talk later. Phoenix Thank you! FREESTYLE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP BATTLE What are you doing? -I didn't do it on purpose! -Really? This isn't the first time I've seen you dancing here. -I didn't. -Yes, you did! -I didn't. -You did too! Do you know how much we pay each month to come here? You want to dance? Well, go on! Dance. Dance! Come see the village girl dance! Dance! Dance, village girl! What's going on? You people go back upstairs! The rest of you continue rehearsing! You are a cleaner. From now on don't do anything except cleaning. You should have been concentrating on your duties. I-- Let me finish. I have to let you go. -It wasn't like that-- -But you can take dance class here. I'll bring Mr. Li up to speed. I have no money. All fees are exempted. And the school will give you an allowance as well. That's too kind of you! I don't know how to thank you. Can I buy you dinner? You don't have to do that. You're a natural. Work hard! I'm so grateful. You don't know how much I love dancing. -Let me buy you dinner tonight. -Maybe some other time. I'm not the type of girl who has dinner with just anybody. But I really don't know how to thank you. Some other time. So you're not coming? Then I'll go. -Hey! -Yes? Do you have heels? Mr. Chan. This lady and I are going out tonight. Would you please...? No problem. Come with me. Your friend is all set, Mr. Chan. I've never worn backless before. You look really beautiful. -Really? -Sure! You have potential. I have faith in you. Let me enroll you now, miss. -Give me 500 bucks and I'll-- -Bonkers. I'll.... Here's your money. That's it. You suckers never pay back what you borrowed. Your table is ready, Mr. Chan. This way, please. Have you got a menu with pictures? Why don't you let me order for you? -Is there anything you don't eat? -No. Two lobster bisques. Two sirloin steaks. Both medium rare. That's all. You must be a very good dancer to own a dance school. I don't dance. Then why the school? These days the young spend more than adults. So I plan to reach out to them with dance. Then they'll buy my other products. I'm a businessman. Why do you want to make all that money? There would be no quality of life without money. Wine, sports car, nice house. They all cost a lot. Tell me how important you think it is to make money. When was the happiest day of your life? The day when my company got listed. That is to say, the day my assets became worth five times as much. The happiest day of my life was one summer. I went to work in the fields with my father. The sun was shining down on us. And suddenly there was a shower. And after the shower, a huge rainbow in the sky. It was so beautiful. I don't understand your kind of happiness. Maybe it's because I don't have any money. But I believe that the best things in life don't cost a thing. I almost forgot. I see you like earrings... ...so I picked these out for you. Thank you. I have to go to the washroom. The sun is coming out! The lyre is tuned! Hey ho, hey ho, hey ho, hey ho Here I am. Sometimes the best things in life can't be bought. I didn't understand that, but now I do. Wait. Look me in the eyes. And? Nothing! Phoenix, you're so lucky! Don't you forget us! Don't say I didn't warn you. You're blinded by that cute-looking guy. You'd better watch yourself! He can tell me lies... ...but his eyes can't fool me. Put me on the line with Samuel. Hi, Samuel. The boss wants to talk to you. -Samuel -Boss. l want Phoenix in the school team for the competition. -I don't think that's a good idea. -Hear me out. First, I've seen Phoenix dance. She really is talented. Second, I'm also running a business here... ...and the success of a business depends on publicity. A peasant girl making it big.... Shanghai would really become the City of Dreams. Do you get the gist? I do. Dad! I haven't talked to you for quite a while. Let me tell you a terrific thing that happened to me. I'm going to participate in a dance competition! l don't know how it'll turn out... ...but l think street dance comes from the heart. lt's very instinctive and impromptu. Just like singing in the fields. So it's not like the routine kung fu you taught me... ...that couldn't even catch a fly! You are now facing your greatest challenge ever. As you know, they've been world champions for three years in a row. You're coming from behind. Now you have the chance to challenge them. l don't expect you to win. But l expect you to do your very best. Failing doesn't matter. What matters is that you've tried! This is for you. Thanks! How long do you think Phoenix and the boss will last? Gold digger! I've seen plenty like her. They all wind up the same. Right! The prettiest ones last three to four months max. Peasant girl, two months tops. Oh, poor peasant girl! -Let's go shopping after work. -Fine. -Any stores on sale? -No idea. This is such a classy place. Can you afford it? Don't worry! We've got Ron. -Mr. Chan. -Here he is! -Sorry to be so late. -You're not that late. Hi! My name is Snow. Hello! Something's come up. I won't be able to dine with you. Enjoy your dinner. I've put it on my tab. Snow, let's order! Do you think he really loves you? He's always so busy. Really? Why would I lie to you? That's not what I meant. I'm afraid you might be lying to yourself! He's so good-looking and rich. How could he not be a playboy? And how could you get so lucky? Let's order. Five, six, seven, eight. Stop! I don't care what kind of problems you've got. You're part of a team. Make one mistake, and the whole group tumbles with you. This competition is very important for us. I won't hesitate to kick you out if you fall behind! Let's carry on. We'll start from the top. I understand. But hear me out. Phoenix is a peasant who doesn't know shit. She has nothing. But if she could dance her way onto the stage... ...isn't that the stuff of Cinderella? That's the point. Nothing sells better than this. Let's do it. You heard what I just said? Silly girl. It's just publicity. Don't make too much of it. Are you seeing someone else? What are you saying? Hello? Okay, I'm on my way. I've got to rush. I'll call you later. Snow! Where's Phoenix? I can't find her. What are you doing? What's wrong with you? -Are you all right? -What have you done to her? -What's happened to Phoenix? -She's disappeared! What? I told her it was too good to be true. But she wouldn't listen! It's all your fault! Horny bastard! -Slut! -What? Besides your first kiss, was there anything else? What are you talking about? What I meant was... ...after the kiss, did you do anything with him? Nothing-- Nothing left? He's a dead man! Let go of me! He's a dead man! I was trying to say nothing has happened! But there goes my first love. Your old man understands. But that's life! There was a time, when you first learned to walk. Your first word. The first time you worked in the fields. There are so many first times in our lives... ...but we forget them very soon... ...whether they're happy or sad memories. They're gone, gone like the wind. But it still hurts! Dad! Don't you worry about me. l've found my dream here! Everything's fine! Okay. Till next time. Bye! Dad, l haven't talked to you in a while. l have a wonderful thing to tell you. l've found a job, cleaning toilets in a dance school. Dad, something bad happened recently. lt almost made me give up my dream. lt's so easy to give up. Having the courage to carry on is harder. But l know now what l should do. Nothing is impossible as long as l believe in myself. Okay! It's nearly time. -There's Phoenix! -Really? -That's not her! -Where? It hurts. Qian, you stand in for her. Why not let Cindy take her place? You go! No, you. Me? Yes! Are you a man or a woman? It takes all kinds. I'm just a bit special. What's wrong with that? Phoenix! It's Phoenix! Yo! What's with the outfit? I bet she's your daughter! Dancing and kung fu walk hand-in-hand. They come from the same place. Yeah! Yeah! What are you doing here? Phoenix! You were great! Thanks. I never had the chance to introduce myself. I'm May. Ron's sister. That was me the other day. I called Ron from the airport. I wanted to surprise him. Didn't realize it'd cause a problem. My brother really loves you. He's been upstairs cheering you on all night. Look into my eyes.
