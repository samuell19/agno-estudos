- How's it going? - All right. - What's that Saffet? - University entrance exam results. Have you passed? Bring me a cup of tea and l, ll have a look. - Haven't you looked at it yet? - No I haven't. CLOUDS OF MAY - Hello, Dad. - What a surprise to see you. - How are you doing? - Come in. You stilI haven't had the doorbell fixed. I haven't had time with all this work. You've changed the house around. We had quite an upheaval. Painting, etc. MuZaffer, you're a man of surprises. Are you tired? Yes l am, Dad. You look tired as well. Were you at the field?' Yes, and it tired me out. After l got back l fell asleep reading a book. Have you come from Trakya route? Yes. l waited for the boat. Where's Mum? Do they shoot the movies with these small cameras? No. We use these for the test shots. Isn't Mum here? There, she's coming. Let me surprise her. - Muzaffer, you've come. Welcome home. - Welcome to you too. How are you? - Fine thanks. How are you? - Fine. Just a minute Muzaffer. l'll give the child something. - Isn't this Uncle's son Ali? - Yes. - Mr. Ali. - Yes. - How old are you now? - Nine. - Which grade are you in? - 2A. 2A? - Where's your dad? - ln Canakkale. - What's he doing? - Working. - Does he get back sometimes? - Ali. Come here. Put this in your pocket. - Don't forget what l told you, OK? - All right. Come on. Don't be late for school. - He looks a lot like me, Mum. - Of course. He's your relative. Fmin. What was that sound? - What sound? - That sound just now. L heard nothing. What kind of film is he going to shoot? - Who? - Muzaffer. L don't know. Definitely it's not something that will make money. That's for sure. He never does work that brings money. Is the disputed area up to these poplar trees? Yes, it's from this road to the poplars. Look at these trees, without them this field would be worth nothing. The government won't let you have them. - What? - They won't let you. Aren't you tired, are you going to chop wood? L'm just going to chop these. - Let me help you. - lt's all right. Stop. Wait. - Give it here. - l, ll do it, leave it. Not like that, you should chop diagonally. Muzaffer, as long as you have these boots on, you don't have to worry about rain or mud. You can go anywhere in bad weather. Come Dad, sit down for a while. Are you always going to sit in the shade like this? What can l do? Are you shooting a film? Are films shot with a small camera like this? - No Dad, with bigger ones. - With bigger ones? Look at the beauty of these trees. The government encourages people to cut them. You cut them down, they give you the title deed. If you don't cut them, then they want them. - Is that right? - Yes. When did you say they would come? - They say about three months. - There's still a lot of time. Of course not. l've been waiting for them for twenty years. - What is three months? - That's true. They said it will happen in two months' time. But when they come l absolutely must be here. If l am not, they'll mark the trees and go, then you can't claim anything. - So what? - The land survey comes. They have a judge, an agriculturist, a forester. They look where's forest and where's field. They have a can of red paint for marking the trees. This is a lot of land, they won't give it to you. Is there a law in Turkey saying you can't grow trees? - These were planted in 1 926. - You can't prove it. They can come and check the age. But the other trees around are the same age as well. Take a look at the trees on the other side of the road. Is there an oak tree like this one? - It's all scrub. - There's not much difference really. Of course there is. These give acorns, those don't. It took 20 years for them to produce acorns. How will you prove your point? l still don't understand. Look, l've got really good evidence. There's a case on this issue. All we need is a photocopy to hand over to the judge. Then there is Article G. It says that privately owned land doesn't count as a forest up to 3 hectares. And the poplars, they don't count as a forest. If you take away the poplars, they are about 3000 m2. Take it away from 851 0, we've still got 531 2 m2. And then there's Article F and Article E. Article 1 69, after a certain time having the forest land. Anyway, there's no forest. L don't understand why you're making such an effort. You're getting old anyway. L don't intend to die before all this is over. Why are you in such a rush? What will you do with it if you finally get it? This place has been mine for years anyway. One day a forester came and had a look and said that... "l had looked after the place but that they would take it off me." How can they? Do we live in the age of tyrants? - By law they can take it. - They can't take it by law. Everyone here cut down the trees in their fields. They told me to do the same otherwise l,d get in trouble. They cut down all the trees, and the governor came and gave them their title deeds. And then they come to me saying this is a forest. L could have cut down the trees away and the forester would have just gone away. - Then what are you frightened of? - l, m not, but you know this is Turkey. Someone will come and say this and that. L put my life into this. L'll fight them to the bitter end. That's why l definitely have to be here when they come. Hell, l've got no friends left. They all went to university. There were so many dumb people in my class but they all got into university and left. lt's only me left here. Did you enter the university exam this year? Of course l did. The red light of the camera is on, Muzaffer. Never mind. What's the result of your exam? L failed again. L looked for a job and ended up working in the factory. If this film works out, can you leave work? Of course l can. - L think the tape is rolling as well. - Never mind, it does. L will give up my job, but will you be able to find me a job in lstanbul? L guess l will. As long as it's lstanbul l don't mind what job it is. If not, you can work with us, we'll take care of you. Come and sit down. No, l' m going to read a book. Ali. Come here. - Where have you been? - School. - Which grade are you in? - 2nd. What do they teach you at school? - Nothing? - They do. - Do they teach you about tortoises? - No. - Have you ever seen a tortoise? - Yes, l have. - Have you seen a tortoise's home? - No, I haven't. Let me show you one then. Then we'll drink something. Ali look, a tortoise. It's escaping. Hurry. Not bad ! Wait. Look... how it hides its head. Let's put it somewhere we can shoot it better. - How's that? - Nice. It is quite an old one. - Have you seen one before? - Yes, l have. Ali. Come here. Sit. Look at me. Smile. Laugh loudly. Stop. Now look sad. Cry. Very good. It may be possible. Don't yawn, are you tired? Why don't you take your hand out of your pocket? - L've got an egg. - Let me have a look. - Who gave it to you? - Your mother. My mother! What are you going to do with it? If l can carry it in my pocket for 40 days without breaking your mother is going to convince my dad to buy me a musical watch. - Why doesn't your dad buy you one? - He thinks l, ll break it. But you can't carry it for 40 days. You'll break it. L won't. How many days have you been carrying it for? Five. - 30 days left. - No. - How many days? - 35 . Good, you're good at math. Why don't you boil it? - It won't break if you do. - No, l won't. - Why? - That would be cheating. No it wouldn't. You'd do better to boil it. L won't. What will you do with a whistling watch anyway? - It doesn't whistle. - What does it do? Play music. What will you do with a musical watch? Listen to music. - Get something else for that. - No. Okay then. But you're holding it too much. With the heat of your hand you'll hatch a chick out of it. L won't. Look you have already. Can you hear the cheeping? - That's the birds. - Listen, hold it to your ear. It's the birds singing. The tortoise is off. Go and fetch it. Run. Look Ali, you know what l,ve thought of? Hide the egg somewhere on the way to school, you can pick it up on the way back. No. - Why not? - Because. - Why not? - Because that is cheating. What do you know about cheating? To trick someone. But you never trick anyone. Come here. No running away. You can't leave like that. Stay where you are. Which is the front? Where's your head? Are you filming? Ali, get up. lt's raining, come on. - We're going to get wet. - Never mind. Come on run. Catch me up. L saw Ali today. Did you give him that egg? L gave it so that he learns a bit of responsibility. He won't be able to do it. L know he won't. We could have done it without the egg. Is this the place? - Is this Pire's house? - Why are you asking? We've come from the homicide desk. l'm Detective Muzaffer and this is lnspector Saffet. We're investigating a crime. - Is he at home? - He might be lying down. - Does he live alone? - Yes. Okay. - Is it this door? - Yes. Uncle Pire. Who is that? - Guests. - Welcome. - Are you ill? - l, m a bit under the weather. Sorry to disturb you. - Can you get up? - Okay l will. We're outside if you can just come for 5 minutes. - L' ll come right away. - We're sorry. Let's move the table and sit down. Come Uncle Pire, come. Give him a seat. - Hello and welcome. - Thanks. L guess we disturbed you. That's all right. - Are you ill? - A little. It's old age. They say you used to do some plays on feast days. Yes we used to. We're going to shoot a film around here. L see. Okay, okay. Could you do a couple of sketches for us too? Those days are over, but l, ll give it a try. - We can give you some money too. - No need for money. Thanks. That's nice of you. Money comes and goes. Go and get the camera. - Let's do a couple of test shots. - Right. Did you say something? My wife died last month. Really? What did she die of? We don't know. We took her to hospital. They didn't say she died from this or that. L don't know. So it happened. Now l' m alone here. It is difficult to be alone. L've got nothing to do. We all die some day. There's nothing to be done. - Where are the batteries? - Look in the front pocket of the bag. Which front pocket? How many front pockets does the bag have? L'm all alone, my friend. What can be done? That's life. No two go at the same time. One of them always goes first. - Weren't they in the front pocket? - l thought it was another pocket. Here. See this part, read it down to here. - Right. Uncle Pire, now you repeat after Saffet as if it were real, all right? - Right. Keep listening. Come on Saffet. We went into the villages to find food. Say it again. You are addressing me. Use hand gestures. - Okay. With my hands. - Yes, come on. We went into the villages to find food. We knocked on the door and a man answered. He said "Maho". Wait a minute. What kind of reading is that? The sentence "He said Maho" should follow on. - Did l say something wrong? - Come on, repeat again. We knocked on the door and a man answered. He said "Maho". And that's all. Then we went to another house. Uncle Pire. You have to say it as if you'd lived it. L am saying it like that. But you have to use your hands and your eyes. Yes, with my eyes. Now repeat it again. He said "Maho". And then suddenly, on one of the plains we came across the English. We started fighting them. And so on, and so on. - Is this a stable? - Yes. Let me have a look at that. That's what happened. What can l do? My young wife has gone. lt's God's will. Saffet, it's late. Let's go. - Uncle Pire. - Have a good journey. L'm going back to lstanbul in a couple of days. L' ll drop by before l leave. - And l' ll leave you some money. - All right, have a good journey. Thanks, see you. - Definitely not. - Why not? You can. We can't do it. We can't act. L've taken so many videos of you. - Those were just family videos. - lt's all the same. - We're too old to act in a film. - Let's keep it in the family. L found a grandfather but he can't act. - Find another one, are they extinct? - And he wants a lot of money. - What money? - Greedy chap. What does he do that's so wonderful that he expects money? It's difficult working with other people. Just because of that l plan to give the child's role to Ali. Good choice. Have you seen the old videos l took? It will be exactly like those. Let me show you. Did l never show them to you? Show them, but you can't make us act. Incredible inventions. Do they shoot the movies with these small cameras? Yes. L look so old. You look the same. Of course l don't. Look at the lines on my face. Does video show up the lines on the face more? No. It's going to rain. - L can hear thunder. - lt's from the video. Really? Is that a money box or what? It's the stove in the other room. Time goes by so fast. We're growing old. Emin. - Wake up. - What's the time? - Quite late. Go to bed. - l, m going. - Muzaffer, aren't you going to bed? - No, not yet, Mother. All right then, l' m going. lt's late. - Good night, Mum. - Good night. - Don't leave the window open. - l won't. It's cold outside. L' ll get the things ready and come, all right Mother? Drive carefully. - Don't worry l will. - Look out for an actress there. - There's no need. - We can't do it, son. - You can, you can. - Goodbye. - See you, Dad. - Have a good journey. We get nothing in return. We are going to die before we do. - Has anyone rung me, Mum? - No. The meal's been ready for ages. Sit down. L' ll take my shoes off and come. L didn't clear the table because he was coming. Sit down. If there's anything else you want l, ll make it. - Your father looked for you today. - So what. So what happened? You've left the factory. - Is it easy to find a job? - Stop nagging me. Earning your daily bread isn't so easy, son. - Life isn't like that. - Leave off. You gave up that good job at the factory. Be quiet. And let your engine rest. How many jobs have you had? You got another one and left that too. Come back, Saffet. All right, sit down. His grandfather went to the trouble to get him to the factory, but whatever jobs they found he left them. L know someone up the street like him. They think earning a day's bread is easy. It's like a game for them. Saffet! - Yes, Dad. - Where have you been? L've been out with friends. What do you mean by being out with friends? Didn't we get you a job? L hear you've left the factory. - Yes l have. - Why did you leave? Muzaffer came. l'm going to act in a film. He promised to find me a job in lstanbul. What film? What's all this about? We talked to so many people to get you this job. Lots of people would bust their ass for a job like that. Why did you give it up for no reason? Did you see a group of people around? Uncle Emin, what's up? The land survey people. - L didn't see them. - They've come from the city. They might go to my field. - That's why l' m asking. - l don't know. You had better go and look at the fair ground. - Do you know the land survey people? - l don't. You know, dressed in formal clothes, with a forester with them. Car with the 52 number plate. - Yes they're here. - Where? - They went past a while ago. - Did they go this way? L don't know. They were there a while ago, up there. They bought some bread, and put it in the car. Where did they go then? The land survey people with a minibus. And there are the Tedas people. - L don't mean the Tedas people. - They install electricity lines. L don't mean them. The land survey people measure the land. Oh, them. They're here. They'll be shopping today. You'll find them in the market place. Then l' ll have a look there. Kamil, they say the land survey has arrived. Have you heard about it? - Where have you been? - l,ve been around here. - Take a seat. - Okay, just for a while. Sit down, sit down. Kamil, did you hear me? They say the land survey has arrived. - What are we going to do? - Uncle Emin, l don't care anymore. You don't care but what if they take the stable away from you? L don't care. l' ll pull it down. They say they're quite strict this year. - Who says that? - Everyone does. L'm fed up with this business. L think l should give up. Actually you haven't got a village land certificate. Without a certificate there is nothing you can do. The certificate should also be at least 20 years old. In a way it's good that they're stricter this year. The villagers haven't left much forest around. They cut down huge pine trees for a handful of tinder wood. Uncle Emin, l don't care. But it would be a shame if your field house goes. L've got a 28 years old village certificate. L don't know about that. Apparently they mark it even if they see just a couple of trees. How can they? There are laws. Who can challenge them? It's down in the records of the Court of Appeal. Where the land survey hasn't been, village certificates count. Yes, you're right, but you're forgetting something. Come in, Mr. Eyup. Is that you, Kamil? It's me, sir. The trousers you made don 't fit me. What's wrong with it? It is too tight. It needs letting out. And the waist is too tight. Don't worry, l' ll do it, sir. We did a fitting but there must be a mistake, sir. I need it. I have a meeting today. Send it over to me. l, ll do it straight away. Fine. I'll send it with the office boy. Right, sir. l' ll do it. Do it straight away. I have a meeting today. Sir, you send it to me. l, ll do it straight away. Yes sir, all right sir. Bastard. What can l do if you've got such a big ass? Eat all that fattening food and then put on weight. Before the phone rang you said l was forgetting something. You know you were saying something when the phone rang. L wonder what l'd say. Uncle Emin, he stuffs himself with all that meat, his bum swells up and then he phones me to say the trousers don't fit him. What can l do if he's got a big ass? He needs trimming down from the back and front. According to the law, the village certificate is valid in places where the land survey hasn't been. Everyone interprets the law the way it suits them. The other day in our village they marked Turkmen's trees. They didn't show him a drop of pity. Wait a minute, did he have a village certificate? L don't know. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. Osman, did the land survey go past here today? No they didn't. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Yesterday some people went past. - Not yesterday, today. I haven't seen anyone today. - Have you been here all day? - Yes, l have. Right then, see you. Come here, boy. Come to my side. What's the matter? Take this basket to Dondu's house. - L don't know their house. - Don't make excuses. If you go up the hill this way, you'll get there. - L have to go home. - You can go home afterwards. - L've got homework to do. - Shut up. Take the basket. Go into the courtyard and put it on the doorstep. - Can l leave it in the courtyard? - Someone might take it. Go through the garden gate and leave it at the doorstep. - Okay. Go on then. lf a dog comes just sit down where you are. Don't squash the tomatoes. Don't knock them against your leg. Remember, sit down if you come across a dog. Then it won't bite you. Uncle, isn't Aunt here? No. Where has she gone? L don't know. Probably to your other aunt. - When will she get back? - She'll be here soon. Don't swing your legs. Sit properly. Stop swinging your legs. Sit properly. Go and come back later. Your aunt won't be back yet. Go and study your lessons. Dad. - Have you memorized your part? - We're trying to. Sadik, come over. - Hello, Uncle. l' m Sadik. - You're welcome, Sadik. - What's all this stuff? - How's it going, Father? Fine. - Shall l help you? - No. The kitchen's empty. - Isn't Mum here? - l don't know, she was around. - You've got a lot of stuff. - Sadik, bring them here. Will you use all this? Of course. These are what films are shot with. It must be difficult work then. Sadik, is that all? Only a bit left. There's no food, shall l cook you an egg? No thanks, this's enough. We're going to Canakkale in a few days to check out locations. You can come, too, if you like. We will. You had a friend, where's he? L took him to a hotel. - Looking for locations for your film? - Yes. Couldn't you find any actors in lstanbul? We've found you. L don't know how we're going to do it. - You can do it Mother. - We'll have to try. It would be better if you didn't take me. What if the land survey comes today? They won't come so soon. L don't like May. l always get a bad feeling. Something always goes wrong in May. How can you say that? lt's a cheerful month. Let me take it. Sadik, put it down carefully. There are things in it that might spill. Don't worry. Action. Now l work as a farm laborer. Let fate have its way. But l don't want to die. If God permits, l want to live at least another 20 years. Is it raining? Rain? No, l don't think so. Stop, stop, stop. That's no good. - The reel's finished. Shall l change? - Yes. Dad, you looked at the camera again. You wait too long between prompts. How do you usually look to see whether it's raining or not? L looked, didn't l? How else can l look? Why is there such a bright light on me? It's ready. We're taking it from the beginning. Mum, you take the bunch and wave it. Ali you hold the reflector. Hold it steady. Are we ready? Ready. - Shall l start reading? - Action. Now l work as a farm laborer. Let fate have its way. But l don't want to die. If God permits, l want to live at least another 20 years. - Is it raining? - Dad, look up. - Rain? No, l don't think so. - Rain, there's no rain. Dad ! That's another 1 0 million wasted. You keep looking at the camera. Did l do something wrong? A pity about the 1 0 million. L didn't look at the camera. Mum, put that down. You wave it when l'm filming. Ali, l told you to hold it steady, didn't l? - Sadik, you take care of it. - Right. Ali, give it to me. Shall we eat something? Not yet. - We've had nothing all day. - We don't have a single scene. What have you done to give you an appetite? Mum, are you beating a carpet or what? Just wave it backwards and forwards. L am doing it like that. You're doing it like this. You have to do it like this, backwards and forwards, okay? Yes, that's how l' m doing it anyway. How else can l do it? And you've put me in these village clothes. Ali, are you still here? Go behind the tree. When l give you the signal, start running down. Sadik, you signal to him. Are we ready? Yes, we are. Saffet, the pauses between prompts are too long. We can't solve this in dubbing. Read without pausing. Dad, don't pause in between, follow him straight away, okay? Let's go like clockwork. Dad, when you look at the rain, look to your left, not the right, okay? - Action. - Now l work as a farm laborer. Let fate have its way. lf God permits... l missed it and got confused. Has another 1 0 million gone? - Have you got an engine fixed on? L said read without pausing, not rush along at that speed. Okay, okay. If we can't shoot the easiest scene, how shall we manage the others? When l read fast you say it's too fast. When l slow down a bit, you say it's too slow. l, m confused. Dad, it's gone up to 20 million now. It was fine, there's no need to shoot it again. Saffet, you have to read at a certain speed. Dad, please. - Shall l look left? - Let's do it right this time. Of course. Where's Ali? He's still running down. - Call him. - Ali ! Action. Now l work as a farm laborer. Let fate have its way. But l don't want to die. If God permits, l want to live at least another 20 years. - Is it raining? - Rain? L don't think so... Uncle. . . l don't think so. Dad, what's happened now? What's happening? Fatma, turn the light towards here. Wait, don't move the light. What's going on? There's the same mark on that big tree, too. - Which tree? - That big tree. They've marked the trees like a string of pearls. Tell me what we'll do now? L'm sure they came here yesterday. l definitely should have been here. And you're bothering me with the film. Don't worry, don't panic. - How can l not worry? - We'll find a solution. You're not taking this seriously. l've lived here for 50 years. - Still we'll find a way. - How can you find a way? It's not a matter of life or death, is it? They are trying to get all these trees. You took me to Canakkale. Have l got the time for that? Don't make such a big deal of it. We'll pull some strings. How will you do that? Nobody has helped me up to now. l've done everything on my own. The wretches have done it now. Either way they would have marked them. L left it on that table. What can we do about it? You're wasting my time with a film. Stop crying over spilt milk. L told you May makes me depressed. And you're talking about flowers. Emin, that's enough. Let's finish the boy's film. We're losing a house, and you're still talking about a film. L don't have time for any film. L'm going. Emin, where are you going? Come back. Don't go. Uncle, come here. Uncle Emin is coming back. Emin, where are you going? Come here. Uncle, come here. Muzaffer, he's going to walk all the way to town. Let him go. - Shall l take him by car? - Never mind. The clouds are low, l think it's going to rain. Muzaffer, that friend of yours, does he know about typewriters? Of course he does. Even l could do it. My typewriter only writes the bottom part of the letters. - Don't worry l'll fix it. - Do you think you can? - It needs quite a bit of skill. - l'll manage it. How low the clouds are. Do you think it will rain? L think so. When the clouds on the mountain are so low, it generally rains. Stop. A fly got in my eye. l couldn't do it well. It was very good Father. If you could just smile a bit more while saying the last sentence. My mouth is trembling. My left eye is twitching. But still a person wants to live at least 20 more years, ha ha ha. Very good, but that laugh sounded a bit forced, Dad. You just hesitated before saying the last sentence. You realized, probably. Did l? Come on. Once more. - There's still 3 days left. - For what? For carrying that egg you gave me. - How many days has it been? - 3 7 days. - Haven't you broken it since then? - No, I haven't. Let me have a look. Well done! You haven't broken it. Now put it down there. You don't have to carry it any more. Okay. - What would we do for you? - Buy me a watch. Then let me tell your father to get you a watch. - But l don't want a watch any more. - Why not? L want a musical lighter. - But you don't smoke. - Not for smoking. It plays music, and it's also a penknife and a torch. What kind of a lighter is that? If you like it so much, let's tell your father to buy it for you. Good. Then you can take this egg with you when you go. My mouth is trembling. My left eye is twitching. But still a person wants to live at least 20 years, right? Uncle, in the end you memorized it. Muzaffer, l'll be in the garage. Call me if you need. Okay Dad. We use too much roll film. How many reels have we used? Around 45 or 50, l think. Shit. We're done for. Sadik, may l have your lighter? - What's this? Lambada? - Yes. How many minutes of film are there in this one reel? About 4 minutes. - Really? - Yes. Holy shit! How many of these does it take for a 90 minute film? How much is one reel? 50 million. And with the developing it comes to about 1 00 million. Fancy that! ln the factory we burst our guts and hardly earn 50 million in 2 months. Working 1 2 hours a day. L go home and the noise of the factory still rings in my ears. It's better in lstanbul, isn't it? More pay for less work? Yes, but you have more expenses. The expenses are high in the big city. Saffet, l've thought about taking you to lstanbul, and l feel it's going to be harder than you think. Our work's bad lately. If you come you'll regret it. - No, l' ll be all right. - We won't be able to help you much. L' ll be living on my own anyway. All you have to do is to find me a job. L'll manage my own life. l'm a grown man, aren't l? It's not so easy to find a job in lstanbul. L think it's best for you to stay here. Here, you've got some security at least. What security? There was the factory, but l left that. Where am l going to work? What am l going to do? - There are things you can do. - No there isn't. This place isn't like you think. But lstanbul isn't like you think as well. You can hardly tell what season it is. - It really is like that, Saffet. - You can see a tiny bit of sky only from the toilet window. The houses are dark. Living in lstanbul is difficult. What toilet window? You've got a wonderful terrace. - Do you see nothing from the terrace? - How do you know that? We were there a while ago. That is where l live, but where are you going to live? L' ll find somewhere like that, too. - Lucky you. - Do you know how much rent l pay? L'll find an old one then. You had better stay here. It would be enough even if you work in the fields. Everyone in lstanbul is trying to escape somewhere else, and you're going on about lstanbul. A lot of my friends have moved down south. A few jumped off the Bosphorus Bridge. L'm not a maniac to jump off the Bosphorus Bridge. Better the devil you know, than the devil you don't. You'd better stay here. L wish dawn would break so that we could finish the film. There's still quite some time to go. Saffet! Come on. Let's finish this. Okay. Catch it. It's yours. Mind the knife though. - What was that sound? - Nothing. Aunt, l don't want a lighter, l want a watch. Why? If l have a watch l won't be late for school. You change your mind so often. So now it's the watch again. You'll talk to my dad about a watch, won't you? All right. L'll tell him. Fatma, l didn't sleep at all last night. l thought it over. L'm not going to let this matter drop. L went through all the relevant articles one by one. Where were you? In the garage. l worked and thought. L will take them to court and ask for expert opinion. By law you have that right. - What does the lawyer say? - The bastards don't know a thing. L'm going to be my own lawyer. L know most of the crucial points. L'm going to succeed. There's no turning back. The legal obligations are clear. L won't give up. l, ll pursue it right to the end. - What if it doesn't work? - What do you mean? You speak nonsense. The law is on my side. L'm not pitting my strength against justice. L am going to seek my rights in a systematic way. Okay, Saffet. Let's get our things together and go. - Saffet, hold this. - You can carry it. - Dad, aren't you coming? - No. l'll stay here for a while. You were cold last night. Come on. - Emin, aren't you coming? - l'm not coming right away. - Come on. The car's taking us. - lt's all right. l'll come later. Uncle Emin, there's some watermelon left inside. - What's that? No, Muzaffer. - Take it. lt's yours. You couldn't get any sleep last night. - That is no problem. - Take it, Father. L' ll put it here, and you can take it later. Get some sleep first. All right. Don't tire yourself. Dedicated to Anton Chekhov
