If something happened! I want to know. Nothing happened! Then what? Maybe I should move to another unit. Wait a while you don't know anything yet. Give it some time. You thing someplace else will be better? Maybe you'll make some friends. What friend? Not everyone does what he likes ...in the army. You mother used... to make tea did she complain? I made tea?

Pull over okay. - Mom Pull over already! - Okay. - When are you coming home? - I don't know. - At five? - It's the army how should I know? Okey girls as far as I'm concerned summer camp is over! Dana is in prison and she won't be back. You don't realize what happened at the border crossing. therefore I have no problem whatsoever to put more girls in jail. Is that clear!

Between 10:00-10:30 and 14:00-14:30 and you'd better stick to the schedule... because we check. I see that... the problem with your shoes is solved. They gave me new ones but they're tight. They'll stretch on patrol. Go on get to work. Your ass will stretch on patrol. - Shall we go? - Where to? To the signpost. Why the signpost? We can go over there. I don't care. If you don't care we'll go to the signpost. It's good that you put her with the squealer. What's good about it? Nothing it's just a feeling. You don't say. Drive! - Are your shoes tint? - Yes! Why? No reason. You're walking slowly... If you don't like my pace... you can walk faster. Do they look like Arabs? Why are you asking me? I thing we should go over to them. Then go. - Excuse me good morning. - Good morning. Can I see you ID please? - Yes. - Thank you. - Please. - Thank you. It's not here. I can't find it. Why don't you look again. Soldier our bus.

Come. I found it. I'm sorry I... Why are you sorry? You're such a moron. Thank you. - Where are you forms? - Mirit has them. Do we have to hand them in? What did you thing? Do you want to keep them as a souvenir? You didn't white anything down. As for tomorrow we won't accept such forms. - Excuse me! - What? - It doesn't look good. - What?

I'm not going to buy it so I won't just try it on. Too bad. Come in come in. Do you want to try the hat on? - No no now. - Okay. I'm making some tea. She makes me nervous. Don't you want to sit down? No it's okay. Sit down! Let her keep guard. Julia haven't you finished that sweater? It's a new one. What will you do with all of them?

Forget the bagle thanks. - Dubek is on the way? - What's on the way? C'mon I don't think they'll be back. That's it I'm going. - Bye. - Bye. - Hello. - Hello. I'd like to make an appointment. Why make an appointment? I'll be right with you. I only have half an hour... I'll be done in a minute... No I don't want a haircut. I only want to take a look I love these challenges. In my opinion... we can play with the bangs. I'll bleach your bangs blonde. when you were your beret you can put some gel on it. And when you take off the beret it's still sculptured and flowing... If I'm not mistaken... someone is looking at you all time. Don't look. I'll turn the chair around a bit. What a pain in the ass! She's just like clockwork! I'll come back some other time. Why are you following me? The break is over. So I'm worried about you Don't worried about me! Yes. May I speak to you? Yes? I don't want to make any trouble maybe it's too early but I want to know if there's... a chance of moving to another unit? Sit down. - Is something wrong with our unit? - No. - Is everything okay on patrol? - Yes. - You get along with the girls? - Yes. Then why do you want to move? I don't know I... I asked to be stationed far from home... but I'm close to home. Something wrong at home? No... I just wanted a different kind of army service far from home... - Like what? - I don't know. An operation sergeant? Or a tank instructor? Yes something like that. You con move to another unit but only after 6 months. You can't do much about it now. But if you'll be okay and everything works out well. I'll recommend you later on. - So nothing can be done now? - I'm sorry. Yes, thank you. Hi Smadar. You've already left for the army? We don't get to talk we have to set fixed days. Sweetheart I'm sorry I didn't catch you. Regards from Dad and Ronni As far as the maintenance fee... I hope you remember to pay the dues. Kisses. Bye. Girls. Things here are wrong. According to your forms... it look like the Arabs have vanished. But what's worse is that... you're not doing your jobs properly. These forms weren't meant to be taken out for a morning walk. These forms have a very specific purpose! If there's a terror attack what do you think I can do with such forms? Here's a random form. Adi and Nizan. Erasures illegible handwriting. Do you understand what's written? I don't! Let's go on. Rotem and Yedida. Only 5 Arabs are listed in the form? Next. Yifat and Perah. This is a proper form. This is how a form should look. When there are no complaints... I don't complain. Next. Smader and Mirit. 3 people listen on the form. Only 3! What do you say about this? Go ahead. They were the only ones there. "The only ones there". Okay. - Here's a map of Jerusalem. - Shut up. Sector 3. The entrance to the Old City. Jaffa Gate Jaffa Street the entrance to the City. There are no Arabs in the morning? Nobody goes to work? No more suspects? Everything is okay? - Explain it please. - I can't explain it. How do they get into the city? They fly over this sector! Find another explanation. I don't have one. In sector two Yifat and Perah's sector which is right next to yours the page is full of names. Some of the people must have passed into your sectors. What do you say about that? Maybe I don't know what an Arab looks like. You don't know... You don't know what an Arab looks like? Okay. No problem. Where are Smader and Mirit today? On buses. I'll patrol with you today. I'll show what an Arab look like. Sit down. You sit on the other side. Look straight ahead. - Go over to him. - To whom? You know who. Get up and register him. Get up! Excuse me. I need your ID card. Yes. Thank you. Be careful. I suggest you be careful. From today bring your forms directly to me! Don't start with me! Don't start with me at all! I'm sick and tired of you and all your girlfriends! Okay I'm sorry. It's always the same thing... in every bus I take. Excuse me soldiers. What's the problem? There's bag by itself and nobody noticed it. - Where? - Right here on the seat. Dose this bag belong to anyone? Dose this bag belong to anyone? - Let's stop the bus. - Driver! This bag happens to be mine. I'm surprised you didn't see it. - What? - This bag belongs to me. It was on the seat by itself and no one noticed it. - That's very serious! - I'm sorry. What good dose that do? What do you do? I only want her to understand. That's all! If you all blew up now her apology wouldn't help us! Leave them alone. I only want her to understand. What you understand? Who do you think you are? Do you think we're playing here? Do you thing we're enjoying? Give me you ID now! You're disturbing an officer on duty. - You want my ID? - Yes. - Then I want your ID. - No! Give me you ID... No... give me yours! What is this? What do you mean what is this? You're psychopath! - You're fresh! - Driver we have to get off! - What nerve! - What a psychopath! - You better watch out. - A psychopath! I'm dying of hunger. Haven't you eaten all day? I didn't get a chance. I'm dying of the cold. Julia come on I'll give you a lift home. I'm coming. Nice bike! - Come no. - This is so cold. Come no. - Stop it! - Just a second. I don't want to take just anything. Take something that you thing I want most. And I'll take something... I thing you want most. - Did you here me? - I hear you. Look. Didn't you bring anything sweet? - No. - I did. Really? - What's that? - Nothing special. Nothing special? - Why did you take it? - Why did you care? It has nothing to do with a meal. So what? So why steal it I don't get it? What don't you understand? I needed some get... so I took it. What's the matter? I don't know I don't like it. - What don't you like? - That wasn't our plan. We didn't plant our lives either. I could have also stolen shaving cream. So why didn't you? Because if I need shaving cream. I wound have bought it. Why to go! You're really okay! That's right. I'm really okay. I might be a little boring but that's how it is. You are boring. I think... I'll go to sleep. - You know what? - What? I don't know why I got into this. - Stealing doesn't excite me. - I know it. - You're simply boring. - Oh really? - You're totally fucked up! - Excuse me! You're totally fucked up! They told me you were fuck up. - They told you? - Yes. Go to whoever told you that... ...and tell them they're right. - Terrific. - I'm going. - Go on.

Do you want to do some thing on the break? I can't. That's okay. But the kiosk... Excuse me where are you going? What? Okay bye. Excuse me sir please register with her. But... I ask you to register with her. This is my card. She told me to register with you. I don't have the forms she does. - Really? - Really! The other soldier said... that you have the forms. Come with me, please. Take it! Register him. You can go. Have a good day. Why didn't you register him? Why didn't you register him? I didn't feel like it! Do you intend to sit here for a long time? I haven't decided yet. When will you decide? I don't know. Excuse me I want to open the shop. Forget it! I'll do it myself. Give me the forms. Give me the forms already! Take you bloody forms! Where is my bag? I can't find it... My bag... Where's my bag? I can't fine my bag. I have to go. Come help us will these people... Don't let anyone pass... Mirit help me! Are you Mirit Shimoni? No I'm her friend. Let her pass. An hysterical woman is looking for her. Who's looking for Mirit? - I am! - Come over here. Are you Mirit's mother? Have you seen her? - I saw her she's fine. - Are you sour? Yes she's fine. - Are you sure? - Yes. Mom? No I'm Okay. Everything is okay. I wasn't at the bombing... I was nearby. I don't know Mom it was a mess. Stop it Mom I'm okay. it was a mass... I don't remember what happened. I'm not going to any neighbor... and I'm not alone. Who told you that I'm alone. Okay I'll call. Mommy... I miss you. Okay bye. It's not only because of the bombing Mirit didn't want to beginning that unit form the beginning. Listen sweetie... No problem I'll phone someone. But it takes time have a little patience. He's right. It's not a good idea to expect things. Forget about it and then one day you'll get a surprise. From my experience the best thing to do is to go to your commander and talk to. I'll like you all to meet my angel. She's the one who told me that Mirit ir okay. I brought you your bag. How sweet of you. eat with us. No I only come to bring the bag. Sit next to Mirit. Where did you find the bag? A policeman gave it to me after you left he thought it was mine. - Are you in Mirit unit? - Yes. Poor thing you had an awful day. Have some bread. Maybe she doesn't feel like it. Actually I only dropped by to bring the bag. - People are waiting for me at home. - Sorry. Maybe you can leave me... your parent's phone number so I'll have someone to talk to... in case something happens. My parents are abroad. They're abroad? They work overseas. So why are you going? Stay overnight. - Okay. - Okay. Do you sleep with one pillow or two? I sleep with two but... One. Actually two. You can sleep in these. Choose whatever you like. Okay... If you need something I'm... - What's your mother's name? - Yael. And yours? - Betty. - Betty. I'm only kidding it's Frieda. Listen to it it's really a nice piece. I like your headband. Open ranks for the CO's inspection! Open ranks. March! One one Close! Smadar Mirit. These girls were at the bombing. The troop will close ranks. Close ranks. March! One one Close! Two three attention! At ease. Girls I know how difficult your job is. It was important for me to come here And to personally tell you that I greatly appreciate your work. Thank you. Thank you really. In view of the last events. I'm escalating the alert level in the city and our presence will be felt everywhere. I am asking every one of you to ...open seven pairs of eyes and... to understand the importance of your job. while demonstrating sensitivity and restraint towards the people you inspect. That's all. I think we can begin the day. Do you want to add something? Actually. You covered what I want to say. I would like to mention the hole puncher. Okay girls pay attention. As we said... we have hot alerts on terror attacks. All the girls who work... ...on buses pay attention. In order to make sure that... you were there and did you job properly. we decided that from today not only do... you write down the bus number. but you punch' your patrol forms with the bus driver's hole puncher. Everything else as usual. That's the guy who helped me... at the bombing. - He's hot. - He sure is. That's far enough let's go back. No way! Walk over to him. I can't. Go ahead he'll be gone soon. What should I do attack him? You don't have to be so aggressive. Say... "Thanks for helping me at the bombing." Do you want me to go? Cut it out Smadar I can't. He's going! Mirit! Maybe next time. There won't be a next time. You might not see him again. I will I'll see him. Are you going? I won't have time to do this again. Forget it. That's it he's going! Of course! What boredom! "Base commander" How many buses were you on? It's all written down. The bus numbers too. - Did you take a break? - Yes. For how long? Half an hour. - What about you? - The same. Okay that all. see you tomorrow. - Do you want me to give you a ride? - No! - Don't miss the game. - I won't. Bye. - What did that guy buy? - Cigarettes why? What brand did he buy? - Why? - No special reason. - Is there a problem? - No, nothing, really. - Okay, never mind. - Okay, I'll tell you. He bought "Camel Light". You know what? It's strange. He usually buys Camel regular. In my opinion, he'll smoke more of the lights. Give me a Camel Light too and a lighter. - How much is it? - 20 shekels. Thanks. Did you notice the prices want down? Really? Why don't you buy a hat and make my day? - That hat is very pretty. - So buy it. Not now. What if they check up on us? - So don't buy it. - Don't force her. I'm right here. Where would I go? I can't go in now. Someone just went by... and we didn't register him. Don't change the subject. It's like the guy we followed... and you did nothing. It's same with the hat. Hat hat and nothing! Buy the already. Do something! Who said I didn't do anything with the guy? What did you do? I passed by the place. - And... - I don't know what'll happen. I asked what happened? There's nothing to tell. Did you talk to him? Did he offer you a cup of coffee? What? - Nothing special. - What do you mean? - We sat down? - Sat down? Do you want a cigarette? where did you get a cigarettes? It's his. He forgot them at my place. He smokes "lights" now because of all the muck in his lungs... But I think he smokes more now. He smokes light now but I don't know what you did. You know... since they reduced the prices I think I'll buy the hat. Smadar? Dubek is in your area. Bye. What's the matter? Hurry up Dubek's in the area. Great! Don't look back walk normally. Are they on foot or in the jeep? How am I supposed to know? Too bad you didn't ask. Where is she? Maybe she wants to trick us. Good thing, I registered some in the morning. Look straight ahead! She's not her don't you get it? She must have been here... while we were in the store... and she saw that we were missing. Where can I do? We're screwed. All we need is for her to see us okay? Let's go back to the store. Maybe she's there. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Can we go? Okay girls. The Israeli Festival is a head. Our unit is participating. Tomorrow morning you'll report... at the Sheraton Hotel. The bands participating in the festival are staying at the hotel and we're securing the place.
