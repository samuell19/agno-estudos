I'm telling you, nobody lives there. My father says they live out of town but they still own the land. Why wouldn't they just, like, sell it? It's not like that they take care of it or anything. Sentimental value. Sometimes it's hard for people to let go of things. Bullshit. The only thing they let go of is the house. The janitor's dad took his lawn mower there last year. - He tried to cut the lawn. - Come on. No, really, Officer Wilson stopped him. Cited him for trespassing. My dad says it's haunted. Okay. Whatever. Everybody says it's haunted. That's just an old wise tale. Did you just say "Wise tale?" Yeah, why? It's a wives' tale, you idiot. - Huh? - Shut up. It's Halloween, it's creepy, that's why it's a good dare. Twenty bucks for the "Keep Out" sign. That's too easy. Yeah, he's right. That's too easy. So, what is it then? The numbers. On the door. You come back with those numbers... And what do I get? My numbers. Really? Really. Shit. Hello? Don't you just love the smell of all the fresh herbs? It'll cure whatever ails you. - It smells like dirt. - It does not. It's a special recipe. It'll boost your immune system. But who knows how you're taking care of yourself while you're away at school. I take care of myself just fine. I'll be the judge of that. Anyway... It sure is nice having you home. We've just been back for a couple of months, Mom. Sorry if it doesn't exactly feel like home yet. Well, I meant... here, with me. I'm not used to having you be gone for so long. I'm just back for this Oktoberfest thing. Homecoming? Whatever it is that Rachel called it. And then, I'm back to school. It's nice Rachel's including you in things. - She doesn't have to, you know. - Yeah. But I'm like third-wheeling with her and her boyfriend Shane. Oh, they're still together? I thought that they broke up when she went off to school. Oh, shoot. Yeah, that's Rachel. I got to run. Yeah, really twisting your arm. Love you, Mom. Hey, Big Reynolds, you check those tires yet? Just the one around your waist. Oh, you're a real barrel of laughs. - Hey, Karl. - Fred. Shane. - What are you doing here? - You didn't show up last night. Oh, was that, uh, was that last night? You know, I went out on a limb for you. Yeah, well, I didn't ask you to. No, but your mother did. And she was right to. Figured. I didn't think it was coming from you. That's not what I meant. No, it's just what you said. Listen, tough guy. Changing tires and working in a garage may seem like a blast right now, but when you're 40 and your knuckles are bent up like pretzels from arthritis and your back's fused together looking under these lifts... you'll remember this talk. Well, you know, since we've talked about five times in the last ten years, I guess I'll remember 'em all. You got a problem with fixing cars? No, nothing at all. I just got something better for you. Set you up. You got one last chance. - Tonight. - No, it's Halloween. I got Lloyd, Brody, Dax, all back from college. Exactly, they're at college, and you're not. It's time to grow up. You ever want my help again. - "Your help again?" - Damn it, Shane. You can linger in the past or look toward the future, like I'm trying to do. Tonight, eight o'clock. I mean it. It's your move. - All righty. - Yes. Oh, man, this is gonna be beautiful. Hey, you brought your costume, right? 'Cause I'm not gonna be the only doofus stuck looking like this. - Yes, I brought my costume. - Okay, good. Just gonna change into it when I get in the house. Mm-hm. I look good, though, right? - Yeah? - You look great, man. You look like a pirate who just got banged by a Woodland-elf. Shut up. I look good. I look good. I'm not gonna tell you anything. - What? - What? - What? - Nothing, man. - Are you scared? - No. Yeah, Lloyd, I'm scared. Look at you, you're scared. My dad would always punish the crap out of me whenever I went near this house. Yeah? Aw. Let's be realistic, Brody, your dad would punish you for not putting the toilet seat down. Too far. Ooh, okay. Why am I the one doing this? 'Cause Shane couldn't get off work, and you know what? He'd be sittin' here not bitchin' about it, okay? So, we're gonna get in there, scare the crap out of some girls, have some freakin' fun. Look, I wanna get some, I mean... Don't screw this up for me, Brody. - You worried about me? - Yes, yes, I am. No, you know what? I'm just gonna do it myself. - If you want me to do it... - No, stop, stop. You of all people should know how girls get on Halloween, right? - I got to get some action. - I know. - I know you do. - Oh, get outta here. - I'll go in with you. - No, I don't know. - I don't want you to. - Hey, look, you got it. Stop, you're just wasting time. You're the big pirate man. You got this. Forgot your eyepatch. - This is my eyepatch. - Oh, that's... - Does that mean I... - Not a good comeback. Let's just pretend that's... Yeah, you work on your comeback. Yeah, you know, I will work on my comebacks. Thank you very much. Have fun, pirate boy! When you want something done right. I'm so glad I didn't wear a costume. I knew you guys would bail. Come on, Taylor, you know we never let you down. Except Lloyd, of course. Lloyd's been in a costume all day. - Happy Halloween. - Happy Hallow... - Where is everybody? - Hey, uh... I didn't know, uh, which one you want, so I got you two. Thanks. My lips are so chaffed. I feel like an old wrinkly woman. Oh, my God, don't put that cheap crap on your lips, I have to get mine from this one online store. La-la la-la-la! I cannot believe this is what I have to listen to on Halloween night, I mean, seriously. - Where's Shane? - Maybe he's not gonna come. Oh, thank God, the cavalry has arrived. Hi. I thought Karl finally got to you. Oh, get a room. - Nyah. Dax, what's up, buddy? - Did you miss me? Ah, I missed you, Of course I did. What's going on, buddy? Thought you were gonna leave me stuck in the Island of Misfits. - You wish. - What's going on? - Hey. - Hey, what's up? Hey. - So, what's going on? - I don't know. - Uh-oh. - Here he is. - Whoa! What's up, losers? - Hi. - Let's roll, man. - Get in the truck. Where's Lloyd? He's got to help his mom with some stuff. He's meeting up with us later. I'm telling you, that kid's a mama's boy. I'mma tell that mama's boy you said that. Don't tell him. - Gonna tell him you said that. - Yeah, okay. Happy Halloween, mother... Shut that door, Dax. I didn't know your family owned that diner. I practically grew up there. Yeah, my aunt did. She actually just passed away, so... Oh, sorry. But mom had to come back and take over the family business. Here I am. So, what's up with this house? You don't remember the old witch house? Uh, no, I don't, I guess not. I mean, I moved when I was, like, six. It's not that big of a deal, It's just been abandoned for a really long time, and so, people make up all these stories about it. - Stories. - It's just old and creepy. Yeah. There was this old house in the neighborhood where I grew up. The old lady that lived there had, like, a hundred cats. And so everyone would call her "old hag." You know, "Witch lady." And every Halloween, all the kids would go and egg her house. Yup, the same house, different town. I think every town has one. You egg it? Me? No. I, uh, felt bad for her. Ah, that's too bad. What does that mean? Nothin'. You're a good girl, that's all. I don't know about that. Oh, yeah? Anyways, it doesn't matter. It's not haunted. No one lives there. At least no one living, anyway. Ooh. This doesn't look creepy at all. Looks so much less creepy at night. - "Keep out." - Doesn't say please. - Oh, lead the way there, ladies. - Careful. - Ladies. - Oh, yeah? Flashlights, guys, I can't see anything. You sure Lloyd's in here? It's kinda quiet. Yeah, I think that's the point. - Hey, wait up. - I just don't wanna get into... - Where you guys going? - My feet are killing me. And maybe inside, you can take a nice warm bath. Never seen this place so close. - Thirty years. - Find that little pickle. I thought you said this was a house. Looks more like an estate. You said this place has been abandoned for decades? Yeah, maybe longer. Some crew tried to renovate it in the '80s and mysteriously disappeared. I heard someone died on the job. Shut up. You guys are just adding to the urban legends. I have an urban legend. Girl dies on driveway of exhaustion. Why didn't we just pull the truck up here? Oh, you want me to pull the truck up to the front of the house, so the cops could see that we're breaking and entering? See, this is why you're in community college. - So cute. - I am cute. - This is so wrong. - So, we're just gonna break in? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Everyone stay there. It's gonna be fun. Hello? Anybody home? I don't think anybody's home. Oh, look at that. It's already unlocked. That's weird. How about that? - Ah! - Brody! Oh, Brody... That was scary. - Oooh! - Trick or treat! Get in. God, you're such a jerk. - Huh. - Oh, my God. It's so dark. How long has this been abandoned again? Who really knows. It's so weird, all the furniture is still in here. It's so creepy in here. Ah! Electricals still on. Hello? Any ghosts in here? Just like we thought. Abandoned. Yeah, no kidding. Hey, where's Lloyd? - Where is the big surprise? - Patience, grasshopper. I always wondered what this place looked like on the inside. Is it everything you thought it would be? Yeah, minus the dead bodies. - Speaking of bodies... - I said dead bodies. Where are you guys going? We're gonna go explore for a bit. - Oh, and what? - What, what? - I know that "What." - Let's go explore. Yeah, let's go explore. Hey... Hey. Whoa, check this out. Yeah, let's, uh, let's go explore. Oh! What happened to exploring? I wanted to explore other things. Ew. What the... Oh, what the... - Now it's on my hand. - Creepy. What is that? Ow, I don't want it. Let's go. Find another room, I guess. You're a little aggressive tonight. What does that mean? Is this what you're learning in college? Why are you being like this? Hey, come on. I know what happens in freshman year. Pretty girl like you... All the drinking and partying. Guys... Is this about Karl? No, it's not about Karl. Yeah, it is. Shane, I know you. This whole Karl thing is just having you in this mood. All I wanna do... is break you out of it, okay? What? Nothing. What now? The ch-chair. Yeah. So, it's a chair. No, i-it moved. Yeah, okay. Would you just relax? I don't wanna be in here anymore. Maybe you're right. Let's just go back downstairs. Come on. Can't believe you're letting this house freak you out already. Look at all these old pictures. Oh, these are so cool. Looks like someone forgot to smile. Hm, she's pretty. Not pretty like you. Hey, uh, caption this. It's so weird, it's like this place is trapped in time. Well... Still feels lived in. Wait, what happened? What did you do? Uh, people in the picture, they're like... freaks. You two bozos breaking stuff already? No, I saw something in the picture. Oh, probably just your reflection. - That scared me, too. - Yeah, shut up, Taylor. Looks fine to me. No, I'm telling you guys... I swear I saw something different. Dax is trippin'. I don't know, their faces was... Who turned that on? - I just bumped it. - Yeah, sure, Dax. Seriously, we were right here. Really? Creepy. Well, music's a little outdated. Let's see if they got some Kanye. Yeah, maybe in this drawer. Nope, we're stuck with this shit. Well, this is a really fun party, but I'm bored. Shane, look at this. - Lana? Lana? - What the hell? - Girls, she's having a seizure. - Back away, give her some room. - Are you okay? - What the hell happened? I saw something in the corner. It was in the chair. This chair? The empty one? I know what I saw. Guys, go easy on her, all right? Hey. What was it? I couldn't breathe for a second. Really, Lana? Whatever, I don't feel very well, I'm gonna go. - Wait, Lana. - Great, Taylor. Lana, what are you doing? Just relax. The door just closed. Yeah, you just slammed it. No. Maybe it was the wind. Wind? Come on, what wind? This is crazy. I'm outta here. One down. - What does that mean? - We're being pranked, Lana. Right, guys? Oh, my gosh, you're so transparent. Lloyd isn't even coming. He was already here, setting all this up. - Right? - It's Halloween, Lana. I think we're just being pranked. You know what? I know what I saw. It didn't feel like a prank, okay? You saw something. Well, come on, guys, something happened to her. She had freakin' blood down her nose. Well, maybe she's a bleeder. Really, Brody? - It's a joke, man, lighten up. - It's not that funny. Right. Of course, it is locked. Hey, you wanna text Lloyd now? This night's going downhill pretty fast. That's weird, there's no signal. Does somebody wanna help me? Yeah. It's locked pretty good. So what, it's locked from the outside? Yeah, you give it a try, Muscles McClanahan. Oh, on to the next trick of the night. - You guys are good. - Do you guys have any service? - No. - No. Yeah, check the back door, I'll work on this. How do we not have service? That's crazy? Back door? Really? We should be able to get through. Well, go for it. - Ah! - Dax, you're bleeding. It's bleeding? Yeah, it's bad, it went right through your shirt. I'll be fine. Somebody check a window or something. - Boarded up. - What? Hey, check the other windows. What do you mean they're boarded up? Yo, this house is a freakin' maze, man. The doors are jammed, the windows are boarded up. I think we're being messed with. Well, did you find the back door? Did you not hear what I just said? Go see for yourself if you don't believe me. Hey, Dax, you got a signal yet? No, it's still the same. Look, something's definitely up. Hey... Are these windows boarded up on the outside? - I don't know. - What does it matter? They're boarded up now. 'Cause I don't remember them being boarded up, that's why. You know, that's it. - Lloyd! - He was here the whole time? Yeah, yeah. I dropped him off, all right? Then just knock it off already. No, seriously, he was just supposed to jump out of the closet, with like, a sheet over his head or something. No, really, seriously, you guys think Lloyd did this? Lloyd can't even do his own freakin' laundry. Hey, can someone just call him? Look, we don't have a signal, a man. It's wood, how hard can it be to break down? Well, this shit won't budge, man! - Pretty hard. - So what? We're like... stuck here? That's ridiculous. Taylor, can you please not touch anything? At least someone else already got the bad luck. - Taylor, stop. - Why? Because it's bad luck, they covered it for a reason. Yeah, so they don't have to look at themselves. You saw those pictures on the mantle. What now? Tell me you just saw that. - Saw what? - Lana? The thing you saw, what did it look like? Come on, look around. There's nothing in the room but us. No, I saw something in the mirror and it wasn't just us. - Guys, enough is enough. - Hey, all right. We're not pranking you guys, all right? - Stop pranking us. - Wait a second. Did the girls get to Lloyd? Is that why Lloyd's doing this, and not you, Brody? Uh, smart girls. They flipped it on us. - I saw something. - Okay. Are you guys not seeing this? Help me, I'm stuck. Taylor! - Take her out of here. - What the hell happened? She lost her freaking finger, man. - Yeah, I can see that. - Call 911. We don't have any service in here. Okay, Taylor, just hold it tight. - I know, I know, it hurts. - You're fine. - Just keep it. - Look at me. - Open your eyes, you're okay. - Call 911. Breathe deep. In and out. - Hold this tight. - You're gonna be okay. It's okay, it's okay. You'll be all right. The hell, this is crazy! Taylor, look at me. You got to breathe. Hey, you guys find anything? There's nothing on the other side of that wall, dude. Well, what the hell happened then? No, don't, don't do that! I know, I know, I'm sorry. Why don't you sit tight? Taylor, can you say something? There's nothing, man. Okay? Nothing! That's not possible, we saw her hand go straight through it. Why'd you stop? Sh-shut up. H-hear that? Trick-or-treaters. Get their attention. Hey! Hey! - Hey! - Come on! Help! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Hey! - Help! Help! - Hey! Hey! Why are they leaving? How could they not hear us? You know, they were right there. Dax is right. It's like they didn't even hear us. No, no, no. I'm sorry, shit. - Hey! - Hey, come on! - I know, I'm sorry. - Come back! - Enough, guys! It's useless. - This is crazy, man! It's like someone's here. It's like, this is cemented in. Anyone hear that? - We all heard that. - Shh. Hey, that sounds like Lloyd. - Yeah, Lloyd's in this house. - Where was that coming from? Grab Taylor, we're not sitting around anymore. - Are we alone? - Come on. Keep holding it tight. We're gonna find him. We need to get outta here. She needs a doctor. How? There is a way out. Here. You go that way. Girls, Lana, Rachel, here, take Taylor. Taylor, you can cross your arm. Rachel, Lana, let's go. You okay? Come on. We got you. Lloyd? Lloyd? Just stay behind me. Lloyd? Lloyd? Door's locked. Lloyd. Lloyd! Guys. What did you do? It just opened. It's some kinda study. Look around for a key or something. God! This place just keeps getting creepier. These books are older than this house. Yeah. Looks pretty old. Why would someone just leave it like this? Hey, check this out. What is that? An old letter. Did you guys hear that? I'm feeling dizzy, I need to sit down. Is every door locked in this place? I'm gonna be sick. Yeah, what died in here, man? - Oh. - Ah! Oh, shit, man. Oh, no. It looks infected. Dax, there's something on your head. My head? - That just happened? - What the hell? "Contrary to the form of the statute provided" to the indictments, the said Annabelle Foster was found guilty of the felonies and witchcrafts and shall be sentenced to death accordingly. Passed together as the law directs, "execution whereof yet remains to be done." "And command you that upon Friday next spring" the tenth day of this month of October "by way of... drowning pit." It's an old death warrant. For who? Annabelle Foster? They thought she was a witch. They drowned her. Where's Rachel? Rachel! There's nothing in here, man. We got to get back with the others. Yo, this place is abandoned. Who's cooking? What's the difference? We have to get outta here. Oh. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Yo, where the hell is he going? - Oh! - What? What is it? Rachel? That can't be real. That is not gonna be me. What's not gonna be you? Dax? What are you gonna do with that? Rachel, what's going on? What's happening? Where's Shane? This is mine. The things in this room... they were mine as a child. What? I just... How can that be? Okay. Hey, we need to get out of here, all right? - Can you just hold me? - What? - Just hold me. - Yeah, okay. Okay. It's all right. It's all right, it's all right, I got you. Rachel. You need to tell me where Shane is, okay? Oh, my God. We were in this room and-and-and I lost them. Okay, we need to go find them. Yeah? Hey, hey, we can't do this. Seriously, we can't... Rachel, this is-this is... Oh, shit. Just take it easy, all right? Oh, shit. Can we at least shut the door or something? Rachel? Oh, no! No. Sorry, Sir, we're closed. Karl? Shane's dad, right? Yeah. Stepdad. See, I'm getting better. Give me a month, and I'll know everyone by how they come in through the door. You can bet on it. I wouldn't bet against you, Miss Brady. We're still closed, Karl. So, how can I help you? Well, I'm sorry for being so late and all, but Shane never showed up to a meeting. Normally wouldn't pay attention to it and all being Halloween, but I went to the other parents, and... nobody knows where they could've gone off to. Last stop, kinda. W-Well, Lana left much earlier with Rachel to meet a bunch of the others, and, uh, S-Shane too, is what I thought. Now you got me worried. No, there's nothing to worry about. They're old enough. I just wanted to check. You-you did check with the others? Yeah. This was my last stop. And-and you'll let me know if... you find them, will you? She'll probably be home before I do. Night, ma'am. Good night. Guys! Hello? - Rachel. - Guys! Rachel, what are you doing? Where'd you go? I-I-I don't know, I saw something, and... I just... Look at all this. Who's lighting candles? What is, what is all this? I don't know, but it's not good. What's this? Oh, great, another boarded up window. It's wood. How hard can it be? Hard, okay? Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on. I think it's coming loose. I've got it. There's something else behind it. - Can you move it? - Uh, yeah, I'm tryin'. What the... What is that? Uh, no idea, it's like these windows don't even lead outside anymore. - Okay, then where do they go? - I don't know, okay? I just... What is that on your hand? I don't know, it's... This can't be real. It can't be... It's like we're in a bad dream. - Ugh! - Not like... - Or... - What is that? Whatever's behind the windows is not real. - Come on. - Okay. Where did he go? I don't know, he, he said he was gonna be sick, maybe a bathroom or something? Shit... Oh. Come on, stay calm. Dax, just get me out of here, Dax, my hand hurts so much. I know, okay? I'll get us out of here, I promise. All right? - Dax? - What? Your face is spreading. What's happening to us? I don't know. Ah! - Ugh. - Sh. Brody! - I don't wanna die. - I know, man. I know! It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Who did this to you? There has to be an explanation. I'll settle for a way out. Oh... Ah... Oh, my God. What? - What? - Oh, God. - Oh, no. - Oh. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, That's not real. It's fake. It's got to be... Oh. Look at it, it's real. He's... Some madman's doing experiments? Or a witch? If you walked out... A witch lived here or what they thought was a witch. They killed her. She's not lying, it's true. I saw the letter too. Oh, God. - You guys... - Oh. This, this can't be real. Uh, yes. Cover your mouth, get down. What is this? Gas? Don't breathe it in. Don't breathe it in. Close your mouth. Don't breathe it in. - Get down. - Ugh. Oh. Oh... What are you even doing? I don't know, okay? I just... I can't leave him here, all right? There's no point, we're not getting out of here. Look, I hear you, okay? I just... I can't leave him here, all right? Door. Dax? Dax, the door! What door? Taylor! Dax! What do you want from me? Why are you doing this? Dax? Brody! Dax! Help! Help! Hello? Who is that? Who is there? Stay away! Help! Help! Help me! Help! Help! Help! Stay away from me. Ah! No! Wait. No, no, come on, come on. Hey, are you okay? I can't. - Are you okay? - No. It hurts so much, I can't feel my hand. Look at my skin. What, what's happening? - What, what's happening? - I don't know. I don't, I don't know, okay? Someone's messing with our heads. So, none of this is true? This isn't really happening. Are you serious? Hey, what were you saying earlier about the mirror? What are you talking about? The mirror that they took off the wall. I mean... I mean, it's superstition to cover a mirror when somebody dies. What? I've never heard of that. Uh, supposedly it allows spirits of the dead to cross over. It keeps them from becoming trapped in this life. Well, what's that got to do with the mirror? Well, it, it's believed that if the spirits of the dead see the reflections in a mirror, that they become trapped. The mirror traps them, and they can't move on, so they cover it. How do you know all this? It's superstition. I mean, don't you ever read books? What does it matter, Shane? I think... Guys, I think the ghost of that witch is haunting this house. That's what's messing with us. The one that they drowned. What if she's stuck here like Lana said. Yeah, and all those stupid stories we've been laughing at... I think that it's true. I think they're real. Hey, hey, hey, that's Lloyd. Get up, get up, we got to find him. Come on. Come on. This way. Help me, I think there's a door here. I can't breathe. No, I'm not going down there. Are you crazy? Well, I'm not sitting around here doing nothing, okay? Shane! Did you hear that? That's Lloyd! We need help. Lloyd is not okay, he's down there. We got to go down there, okay? Look at me, look at me. Hey. Lloyd went down there, he's not okay. You got to trust me. I'm not leaving you, neither of you, okay? Just stay behind me. Lana, I need your phone, okay? We're gonna be okay, come on. Lana, Lana, I need your, I need your light. What if this is a trap? This whole house is a trap. Lloyd! Oh, my God! - What happened to him? - Lloyd, Lloyd, Lloyd. Wake up, please, buddy. Get me out of here. Lana, Lana! Come here. I need that phone. Give me the light. She's coming. What? What was that? Shane, someone's coming. You guys got to find a way out of here, go. - What, what is that? - It's a vent. Can't handle this shit anymore, this is fa... These ropes won't budge. - Shane! - Go! Who's coming, Lloyd? What the hell is happening to us? Just keep moving. Where is Shane? Just keep going. I think there's an exit. Who is that? Who's there? Come on, come on! What do you want from us? - Dax! - Shane! What the hell happened to Lloyd, man? My voice isn't coming out. What happened to you, man? Your face. It's getting worse. Hey, you got to help me get him outta here. Get... Hey, Dax. Dax, come on. Where's Brody and Taylor? Brody's dead, man. What? His freaking face got ripped off! And Taylor, she got out. Wait, she got out? But how did she get out of here? This place is a freakin' maze, man. There was a door, and-and-and then there wasn't a door. I got slammed against the wall. My ribs are cracked to shit, man. It's over, man. There's no use. There's no getting out, man. Do you see my face, man? Look at me! We're getting him out of here, so just hold it together. - It's game over, man. - No, it's not. I can't, I can't leave him in here, man. You got to help me, okay? Just look around, I think it's on a pulley, all right? Look for it. This house is haunted. And not like Scooby-freakin'-doo, man! Real-life haunted. - Real ghosts. - No. No, ghosts didn't do this. What did this to you, man? She did. Who's she? The witch. Let's get this off of you, find the damn pulley, Dax. No, no, no. We'll get out of this. Come on, man. - Dax, you got it? - I got it. - You found it? - Yeah, okay. Okay. I'm gonna get you out of here, it's gonna... Okay, you ready? Okay, I'm ready, I'm ready. One, two, three! Harder! Come on! Come on! Let's get him out of here, man. Hurry up. - Come on, Lloyd, let's go. - She's here. Shane! Ah! Oh, no, no. It was in me, man. It was inside of my body. Dax. Dax! We got to go, man. We got to get the girls. He's dead. Rachel! I'm sorry, Lloyd. I'm so sorry. Look, we got to go, okay? We need to get out of here. Where is she? Just keep moving. I think, I think there's an exit.

Hey, you got to get up, we got to find her, okay? - Come on. - I can't be in here anymore. I can't be in this place anymore. We need to get out of here, we got to get out of here. - Come on. - I'm sorry, guys. I can't go any further, I'm done. Listen to me, Dax. Rachel's still in here somewhere.

Guys, those doors are not gonna hold her, okay? If she wants in, she's gonna get in. Shane! Hey! Hey, hey, gimme a hand with this, huh. The other door, quick. Shane, the door! What the hell happened? What did you do? Yeah, I got my eyes on it right now. It's the kid's truck, all right. Doesn't look like anyone's inside though. Well, it matches up. It's parked right outside Middlecrest Mansion. Yeah, yup. Hey, it's Halloween, Karl. You know the history of this place as well as I do. And you know how the kids are, man. I just hope they'd be smart enough to stay away from this place by now. You know what I mean? I'm gonna head up and take a look for you, okay? I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. But if it'll ease your mind, why don't you meet me up there and we'll, uh, take a look around for 'em. All right. I hope they're not in trouble. I'm sure they're okay. We'll get them home safe to ya. Okay, gotcha. I'll head over. Okay. I'm not going back out there. No, we can't stay here. Hey, come on, Dax. Pull it together, let's go. Oh, God. - You're gonna piss her off, man. - Yeah, so what? Dax. Hey. I'm fine. I don't know what's happening to me, man. Come on, let's go, we got to keep moving. It's our only hope. Look. What if we burn it down? What're you talking, we'll burn it down? We'd be trapped inside. It will free all of us. No, it wouldn't free us, Dax, it's suicide. It would end this, okay, Shane, one way or another. No, we can undo it. How? If you burn this place down you're gonna kill all of us. Yeah, but I've seen worse ways to go. No. Come on, we're getting out. Now, let's go. Okay, just give me a minute, all right? - Give me a minute, okay? - Okay. Hurry up, Dax. She's watching us. Yeah. Hey, where's Dax? What? Dax! Lana, we can't. Okay? The only way to save any of us is to get out of here. What? What? Oh, no, no. Come on. Come on. Wanna mess with me, bitch? Come on. Oh, no. Oh. Oh. What the heck is this? Where are we going? What are you doing? I'm tired of running. Where are you? You like that? You like that? This your stuff? Is this your stuff? Why don't you come out here? Come out! Face us! Face us! Where are you? You gonna mess with our friends? Face me! Goddamn it! Come here, come here. How about that? You like that? Shane, stop it. - Come on, Get out here... - Stop it. Please, stop.

What if she's stuck here like Lana said? Whatever that thing is, she's trapped here and she's using us to get out. - Anabelle Foster? - She's using us. - They killed her. - She's taking things from us. What's happening to me? She's using us. Lloyd, who did this to you, man? So old. She did. Who's she? The witch.
