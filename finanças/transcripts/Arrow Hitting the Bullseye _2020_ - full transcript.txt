3, 2, 1, go.... It's been transformative in every way that you can imagine it would be. BERLANTI: The fact that "Arrow" was the first makes it special in its own unique way that nothing will ever duplicate. OLIVER: People still need saving. It really was miraculous. They still need hope. We've done a really good job, and I'm really proud of us. This city needs The Arrow. To fight for this city. We really tried very, very hard to push the envelope... Fight to survive. It would be as big, bold, dynamic as a feature film. I think it gives people hope. You turned us into heroes. ♪♪ MCNAMARA: Beyond anything else, what's at the heart of "Arrow" is the people. Being a hero is my purpose. Family is exactly what this is about. No matter how much crazy stuff [LAUGHS] has happened, it remains about family. You put together a team of heroes. It means something. You've made it mean something. It's chemistry. It's energy. It's sometimes just got that thing. It changed my life in such an amazing way. You gave me purpose. We're just getting started. ♪♪ GONZALEZ: I was just ecstatic to be a part of the DC Universe and to bring someone to life. You have failed this city. To be a part of something that's meant so much to the fans. When you got to do something so amazing for eight years of your life, you can only be proud. No regrets. OLIVER: My greatest legacy is this team. All of you have followed me this far. I need you to follow me just a little further. That's what heroes do, right? - Let's move. - Let's suit up. - I was blown away. - That's why we love superheroes. - I think it's cool. - It's just fun. - Really changed the game. - That's when the magic happens. It's time to lock in. My name... is Oliver Queen. I am The Green Arrow. OLIVER: The name of the island they found me on is Lian Yu. It's Mandarin for "Purgatory." [BREATHING HEAVILY] Well, it all came from, as pretty much all good things do, from Greg Berlanti. He had an idea for how to do "The Green Arrow" on television. OLIVER: I've been stranded here for five years. I've dreamt of my rescue every cold black night since then. It always felt like "The Green Arrow" had the perfect backstory for a TV series. You knew that there was an origin story that was happening on the island that you could take your time with. OLIVER: For five years, I've had one thought... survive and, one day, return home. It starts with a tragedy. Oliver's father kills himself in front of him and tells him to right his wrongs. Survive. - No! No! - [GUNSHOT] And we divide that between the island and then our world and his return. Oliver? Mom. When I read the script... What did I tell you? Yachts suck. Tommy Merlyn. ...pretty much what I pictured in my mind's eye was really in tune. Hello, Laurel. CASSIDY: When I first read the pilot, I feel like my instinct, my gut knew right away that this was gonna be a hit. Oliver! I want to introduce you to someone... John Diggle. He'll be accompanying you from now on. RAMSEY: It spoke to this bigger story about distribution of wealth and greed. What do I call you? "Diggle" is good. "Dig," if you want. BERLANTI: So, you had this character at the center that had returned from conflict and was mysterious, and you weren't sure... Is this person good? Is this person bad? And the show, in some ways, was kind of a discovery of human nature in that way. And just no-holds-barred. This guy got off an island and had a mission. He was going just full-steam forward. OLIVER: Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish, to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become... something else. It was always gonna be a grounded, gritty crime show with superheroes at the forefront. ♪♪ Whoa! Whoa! Just tell me what you want. We wanted the show to be action-packed... ♪♪ - You missed. - Really? ...and mysterious and have edge and have heart. How did he do it? AMELL: I thought that we had something the moment that I saw the first cut of the pilot. CASSIDY: I mean, I was blown away. I was also really excited to become a superhero, because it looked awesome. [GUNFIRE] As the show evolved and we started to fill out the cast, it really started to come to life in a big, big way, and it felt like, "Okay, wow, we really are realizing this comic in a way that we're all really, really proud of." GUGGENHEIM: We opened up the storytelling in a way that hadn't been done on television before. - Believe me! - Marcus Redmond... you failed this city. We really tried very, very hard to push the envelope. ♪♪ Having the action be very visceral. The camera work had to be - very dynamic. - Welcome, gentlemen. We were doing anything we could to make it as cinematic as possible. Where's the transmitter? Somewhere I can easily get to it. ♪♪ - [RUMBLING] - What the hell's happening! [CROWD SCREAMING] Okay, that's enough. [RUMBLING CONTINUES] We're a show about real people doing extraordinary things. To see the real human struggle, I think that resonates with people. People have to care about the characters. MAN: Help me out! Help me out! Roy! Stop! The device is about to go off any second! Seeing characters on TV who appear normal in a lot of aspects... I can't leave any of them behind. ...but also just have these heroic capabilities really resonates with the audience. ♪♪ The audience is gravitating toward multiple things. They're connecting with the actors in the roles. They're connecting with the story. [SHOUTING] [GASPS] For now it perfect characters, and I think that that's important for people to see. Laurel! - Laurel! - Stop! You know, to be able to be a part of something that's impacting others in such a positive way, it's amazing. [WEAKLY] Thank you. [VOICE BREAKING] No. No. ♪♪ Tommy... [SIGHING] Open your eyes. BERLANTI: And it's nice that a superhero show was, hopefully, so much more to everyone than just a show about people fighting bad guys. ♪♪ ♪♪ Oliver is not a perfect hero, by any means. ♪♪ AMELL: Where we began the series, in the flashbacks, he went through some horrible, horrible moments, and, frankly, make some really, really reprehensible decisions. Shado was already the first, your sister. Laurel, your mother. It took a while, but we finally dealt with him coming to grips with them and him not letting them find him. He's very flawed, and that makes him human, which is why people connect with him. If what you're doing isn't wrong, then why are you hiding your face with a hood? To protect the ones I care about. ♪♪ [SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE] ♪♪ So, Lauren Lance was the lost love, you know, and represented that for Oliver. Nobody in my life is who I thought they were... except you. ♪♪ CASSIDY: That evolution, that transformation. I mean, if you look at my character now and then you look at my character from Season 1, I mean, talk about such a beautiful arc. Laurel Lance, Your Honor. I'd like to file my appearance on behalf of the defendant. Watching Laurel go from, you know, this pro bono lawyer who's a little damaged... I'm the best me when I am working. And when you're not? You don't want to meet her. She's not good company. ...to struggling with drugs and alcohol, and then losing her sister, hitting rock bottom... [SOBS] No! No! Sara! ...and then being able to come out on top and pretty much transform into a superhero. Who the hell are you? I'm the justice you can't run from. I see they've spotted us. BERLANTI: One of the inspirations we were always playing with for the show, because he's got a bow, is Robin Hood. I don't want to go out like Butch and Sundance, so what's the plan? Shoot straighter than they do. ♪♪ We knew in building his cast of merry men that we wanted our Little John, you know, that we wanted to... thus the name John Diggle. SCHWARTZ: When Oliver started on his mission, he never planned on having a team. John, I could have never done this without you. You're the one who keeps me in line. We always felt Diggle was Oliver's moral compass. It sounds like you have a narrow definition of being a hero. RAMSEY: I think that relationship is just something people tune into. They want a friend like John Diggle. When I lost my brother... I never thought I'd get another one. AMELL: They became brothers. He was always the voice of reason, always the logical guy, but that didn't mean that there wasn't a deeper level of emotion and understanding. You're in the field without your head on straight. I think this is exactly the time. - I've got it handled. - It doesn't look that way to me. I just... [SCOFFS] I want her to be happy. If that were true... you'd be with her, man. Felicity Smoak? I'm Oliver Queen. When we first saw the dailies of Emily in that classic scene with her and the red pen, we just saw a different side to Stephen. I know who you are. You're Mr. Queen. No. Mr. Queen was my father. There was just this chemistry that was undeniable. Right, but he's dead. I mean, he drowned. But you didn't, which means you could come down to the I.T. department and listen to me babble. Felicity was kind of like this safety valve character. I should add "Personal Internet Researcher for Oliver Queen" to my job title. Happily... I mean. AMELL: I think that what she brought out of him and that lightness really was one of the main factors that allowed us to build out my character. - [OLIVER GROANS] - Whoa! I'm not gonna hurt you, Felicity. How do you know my name? Because you know my name. You can only watch someone sulk around for so long. Everything about you just became so unbelievably clear. [SIGHS] It was like, "Oh, this is gold," and it provided this whole other color to the show. I always wondered how I'd react if I found my boss shot and bleeding inside my car. It's really a testament to Emily, because she started the show as a one-day guest star. Oops. [CHUCKLES] It's incredible. Your system looked like it was from the '80s, and not the good part of the '80s like Madonna and leg warmers. And once she entered the show, we were able to find comedy and humor and lightness in a way that we hadn't been able to previously. ♪♪ There's so many intense moments on the show. - BOTH: Surprise! - Surprise! To break it up with some humor allows everyone to breathe. Happy Birthday. E-Everything hurt... Everything hurts, yeah. If you can't take the time every once in a while to wink at the viewer... The plane, boss! The plane! You've got to lean into that a little bit. Reference too dated? We're filled with meta-commentary and Easter eggs. It's, uh, a little alien, a little "Star Trek," JJ Abrams style, and a whole lot of tech. This guy's definitely got more than a subscription to "Wired." His website's protected by some very serious encryption. I think fans enjoy those Easter eggs and enjoy the meta commentary, and we're fans. We enjoy them, too. You could use a little therapy yourself. What gives you that impression? You mean, apart from the mask and the Robin Hood costume? AMELL: You mix things up enough that when the serious moments do happen, people go, "Oh, okay. Alright. It's time to lock in." Well, use that air magnet thing. - You said that it could... - Oliver, no offense... but do I tell you how to sharpen your arrows? OLIVER: Stay focused, please. I'll be with you the entire time. Thanks. Well, I like to say that I am the captain of the "Ollicity" ship. It feels really good having you inside me. And by you, I mean your voice. And by me, I mean my ear. I'm gonna stop talking right now. That would be my preference. The two of them are amazing together, even through all their bumps. There you go. Oh, just... I meant to put it there, just leave it there. - Thank you. - You can just... I knew how much the fandom cared about their relationship. Would you like to go out to dinner with me? - I'm being serious here, Oliver. - So am I. That, to me, was the best time, when they were just starting to fall in love with each other. Would you like to go to dinner with me? Yes. HAYNES: Their relationship has blossomed, and to see the heartache and the love between them has really, really been special to watch. I mean, what do we have to be nervous about? [CHUCKLES] Well, we've already exhausted every topic that one would normally talk about on a first date, and a second date, and a third date, and every date, actually, and I've already seen you shirtless. Multiple times. "We're falling for each other, and we're heroes, which means one of us could die at any moment." Oliver? And that's always been the challenge of their relationship. There is one person in particular that I am... grateful for. Someone that has stood beside me when times were darkest. AMELL: She brought out this part of him, a vulnerability and emotionality that you really, I don't think, would have seen otherwise. She is the one who lights my way. I think that makes that the most important relationship that we've had on the show. You. Felicity.

It was all so crystal-clear when you're young... who the bad guy was, who the good guy was, what they were fighting for. ♪♪ As the world becomes a darker place, people look more and more to heroes. I think that when you humanize a superhero, it sort of holds up a mirror to the people watching. Can you handle this? I'm good. Hopefully it inspires ordinary people to believe that they can do extraordinary things, too. [SCREAMS] ♪♪ You see these characters working through, essentially, human things...

Even thought most of our characters don't have superpowers, as it were, they're powerful in their own right, and they bring power in different ways that really shows to their tenacity and their grit. You're ready. LEWIS: You can lead with your intellect, and you can lead with your wit, and it's not necessarily about being physically dominating. Of course, you can do handstand push-ups. There's lots of ways to make the world a better place. Flash storage from the vault security mainframe? Yeah, don't get too excited. It's totally fried.

Man, I really hope this isn't the last time we're all in this bunker together. ...and that they take it with them for a lifetime, 'cause I know we all certainly will. It does feel like the end of an era. FELICITY: Okay, well, let's just try to think of it as the beginning of a new one. I hope that they feel all of our gratitude that we poured into the story, into the show. OLIVER: We're not gonna let the darkness win. So, all of us are here to light a candle together. This entire season, and I think more that last episode than any other, is a thank-you. AMELL: I really hope they walk away happy. I just hope that they walk away going, "Ah, okay. I'm glad I stuck around." ♪♪ To OTA... Original Team Arrow. Sorry, I know you hate it when I call us that. It's growing on me. It's changed my life more than any other artistic thing I've ever been a part of. [GROANS] You took a bullet for me. It was a transformative experience for me, and I will remember and be grateful for it the rest of my life. They were... metahuman tattooed playing cards. Now I'm part of this universe, right? Still counts, Oliver. For me, as a comic book, you know, superhero geek, it was just a dream job. They will carry on your legacy. Sounds like a cycle for good. Far better than that. A cycle of heroes. Any time you spend the better part of a decade on anything, you just grow as a person. Laurel Lance. Always trying to save the world. Runs in the family. We've been really fortunate. It's not "goodbye." It's "until next time." I think there's so many different facets that people can really connect to with our show and that have brought the fans through this journey with us, which is so incredible. These are two of the most genuine people in the world, and they deserve all the happiness, and... I'm so fortunate to call them my friends. GONZALEZ: I think it's just been a beautiful experience to be a part of and to be around a cast and a crew, kind of like a second home. This event warrants celebration. It's very emotional. It's unbelievable. It's end of an era. I am just glad that I found partners who I can trust. That's what I'm talking about. We're all feeling sad to say goodbye. You can only be proud when you got to do 170-odd episodes of television. Green Arrow popped up on our TV... and he reminded me that this city is worth saving. It's been amazing for me to feel like I've been embraced by the fan base in the way that I have. I don't want to waste the time that I have left with him being angry. Do you? MCNAMARA: Everyone involved in "Arrow" has such heart... Thank you for letting me be a part of your story. ...and has such passion for this story and really cares about making it something special. [VOICE BREAKING] Even if it was only for a little while. Mia, something tells me you're gonna create your own stories. I'm proud to have been a part of "Arrow," the show that's created a whole universe. You. You're my family, son. I feel proud. But sad. [CHUCKLES] You're a really good father. So are you. I had a good example. It's been a family, and now we're all going our separate ways. I feel like I'm always asking you favors. Anything you need, Oliver. Always. I think it's made for such a unique series that I can't imagine myself working on its kind again. A soldier never lets a brother go to battle alone. I feel like I'd be failing you. You could never fail me, John. Well, how long do we have? Uh... it's... it's... it's been everything to me. You've always been my rock. Don't you mean the best man you've ever known? I also mean that. The friendships that I've gotten a chance to make along the way with the crew and the cast... ♪♪ It's been transformative in every way that you can imagine it would be.
