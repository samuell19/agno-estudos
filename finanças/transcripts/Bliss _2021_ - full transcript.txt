I have a picture in my head of a place. Home. A woman. I don't know if any of it's real, but it has a feeling, and the feeling's real. I'm sorry you're having technical difficulties. Yeah. You know what? I'm gonna transfer you. Hold on. I'm sorry you're having technical difficulties. What seems to be the problem? Seriously, what the "F"? Wittle's not picking up his phone again. - Hi, my love. - Hi. I'm so happy you called me back. - How's your shoulder? - My shoulder's good. My leg is a little bit achy, but I'm taking the meds, so... Enough about me. How are you? I'm good. I'm good. Um, I wanted to talk to you about my graduation. I can't believe you're graduating. Can't believe? - Really? - Oh, it's hard to keep track of the time, but I'm... I'm really proud of you. Uh, so, um, Mom is, uh, she's getting a reservation at Cliff's Edge. - Okay. - Um... Mm-hmm. That'll be nice. Well, I want you to come. D-Does she want me to come? I want you to come, Dad. Well, I wonder if maybe, if I take you and your brother out the next day and... Are-are you not coming to the ceremony? Of course I'm coming. I'm gonna be there in the bleachers. I'm gonna see you in your... cap and gown, walking across there, and be cheering. I-I just... I-I don't want to... I don't want to complicate things with your mom and... I know that I messed up, and I just want this to be... - the focus to be on... Yeah. - Dad. I have so many thoughts I wish you could see. Are-are you, are you sure you're okay, Daddy? I'm... Yes, I'm better than okay. I'm great. I just... Let me... let me... How about I call you back? - Okay. All right. - Okay. I love you. - Okay. Love you, too. - I love you. Bye. Okay. Bye. Greg Wittle. Bjorn wants to see you. Okay, I'll be right there. Hey, Wittle. Hey. Taking the day off in here? No. I was just getting off a call. Heard the boss wants to see you. Yeah, I'm headed down there right now. I just was speaking with... What you got there? Nothing, nothing. No, it's just kind of private, sort of a... Oh, shit. - That's okay. That's all right. - I'm sorry, man. That's okay. Yeah. - Just let me get this phone call. - Sorry. - Now, Mr. Wittle. - I'm... Okay. I'm... Be there momentarily. Could you get that door for me, please? - What seems to be the problem? - I'm sorry you're having... To refill your prescription, press eight. For the... Please enter the prescription number plus the five numbers after the dash. You entered prescription number eight, nine, seven, nine, seven, eight, four, four, five, five, nine, zero, one, one, two. If this is correct, press one. We have no record of prescription number eight, nine... ...seven, nine, seven, eight, - four, four, five... - Sorry. Yeah, he's on a tight schedule. I understand, and I'm coming down right now. I'm just wrapping up a call. Thank you. ...number, press eight. For the pharmacy department, press one. - Pharmacy. - Hi. It's Greg Wittle, and there's... I'm having a little problem refilling this prescription. You can only refill five times. - You need a new script from your doctor. - Uh... I understand. I've only refilled it four times. You have to count the first one in the five, sir. But why... But that wasn't a refill, the first one. Can you hold on just one second? I'm just... Hold on. - Mr. Wittle. - Racing out the door. Understood. Sorry. Goodbye. Thank you. Would it be poss... Hello? Hel... I'm sorry you're having technical difficulties. What seems to be the problem? Hi, Doris. Sorry. Follow me. He must have stepped out. You can sit there. Greg Wittle. How are you, buddy? Good. Good, Bjorn. Thank you. Look, uh, I'm gonna cut to the chase. Our Indian counterparts are crushing us, autobots are screwing us, - and a lot of this is because of you, man. - What? Where's your head been? Have you been drawing pictures of your dream house instead of answering the phone? - Is that what that note... - What time is it? I'm sorry? That's how you should've led this. You buried the lede, buddy. We always start with "sorry" here at Technical Difficulties. Look, uh, there's, uh, no easy way to tell you this, but... ...you're fired. Greg, you're fired. Greg? The inside of your head must be amazing. This is the beginning of your new life. Bjorn? Yo, I'll be done in a moment! Is he not here? Not yet. Toilet's all you. Well, I'm gonna get some lunch, and he can give me a call when he gets back. I'm sorry you're having technical difficulties. I'm sorry you're having technical difficulties. - I'm sorry you're having... - I'm sorry you're having... I'm sorry you're having technical difficulties. I'm sorry you're having technical difficulties. I'm sorry you're having technical difficulties. What seems to be the problem? I'm sorry you're having technical difficulties. What seems to be the problem? I'm sorry you're having technical difficulties. I'm sorry you're having technical difficulties. - I'm sorry you're having... - I'm sorry you're having... I'm sorry you're having technical difficulties. - What seems to be the problem? - I'm sorry you're having... I'm sorry you're having technical difficulties. Can I get a whiskey? Double. - No ice. - You got it, Greggo. Be right back. - I'll start you a tab. - Great. You're real. Sorry? You know you're real, right? I was just waiting for... I'm sorry, do I know you? You deflected my powers. I'm sorry? Stop apologizing. I'm not apologizing. I don't hear you. I can't understand what you're saying. I don't recognize you. I-I-I don't know you. It's always blurry at first. I'm Isabel. Come sit with me. I'm-I'm fine. I'm just gonna have my drink. Thank you. You need an alibi, don't you? What? Interesting view. Your next step is extremely important. You do not want to spend this life in prison. That would be very, very bad. Look at me. I am going to help you because, personally, I feel a little bit responsible for your situation. Why do you feel responsible? Let's just say it's kind of my fault this world exists. Don't worry about it. It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna fix it. But first, you need to do something for me. I have a boyfriend... an ex. He's a real asshole, and he's in the bathroom. Okay. He has something that belongs to me. Are you even listening to me? Yes. - About your boyfriend. - Ex. He has my amulet necklace, and I need it back. Why can't you use your powers on your boyfriend? Because he's real, like you and I. You keep saying "real." What do you mean by "real"? You see all these people outside? They're not real. The bartender... not real. Nothing, nothing, nothing of this is real. There's very few of us. I think you need help. No, you need help. Get me my necklace, and I will fix the problem for you, Greg. How do you know my name? I took it from your mind. I'm just kidding. The bartender just said it like a minute ago. Come on, Greg. What have you got to lose? Why is this necklace so important? It contains special yellow crystals with the power to manipulate this fake world. Well done. That was fast. Did he give you any trouble? No, he was just passed out. Really? Great. Get back in there and get the wallet. Drinks on him. No, I can... I got money. He owes me. Okay, guapo. Time to solve your problem. You deserve a clean break. Okay. I'm gonna fix it. Hey. You see this? The world is simply light bouncing around your neurons. It's manufactured and malleable. You're free. He jumped! - He jumped! He jumped! - No. He jumped out of the window! Right there. He just fucking committed suicide - in the middle of the day! - What? What were you doing in the bar? Nothing. I was just getting a snack. - I was just... - Let's go. - Did you do that? - Did what? A dozen witnesses saw him jump out of the window, and then saw you walk out of the bar across the street. Convinced yet? I forgot my wallet. - Forget about it. - No, no, I can go back. - I'm innocent, right? - You can't go back. You have to lay low for a while till the case closes. But you said yourself that they saw me at the bar... The witnesses. Exactly. Let them do the talking. Last thing you need is to be in a dark room, bright light on your face, with the Five-O tripping you up, because you will for sure fuck it up. Just lay low. You have a phone? Yeah. Why? ...inequality of income and wealth has surged in recent years. Protestors are... We'll use science to shape policy. Not everyone is convinced. It doesn't make any sense. Bjorn was happy. He wasn't depressed. It's not possible. The most likely cause of death is suicide, although police have not ruled out foul play. Yo. Phone. Hi. I'm Dad, and this is... Emily. And who's the one on your shirt? This is... Turtleistic. That's perfect. - That's great. - Turtleistic. - Cute. - Turtleistic. How much for this? - I'll give you 60 bucks. - Done. ID. I don't have a wallet. I... Can you use yours? Can she use hers? 40. Ten. I mean, better than tossing it on the trash can. Oh, for sure, but they just grind you on that no-ID thing. - Did you know that? - No. I don't have a phone. I'm not that stupid. - Wh-Where are we going? - We're going here, where you'll be safe until the case closes. Welcome to my home away from home. And this is my Ophelia. It's okay, baby. I can't stay here. Are you homeless? Is this legal or... You know, I really appreciate your help. I'm sorry, I think I'm gonna go. And where are you going? I'm gonna go home. Well, I'm staying in a motel, so I'll go back to the motel room, but I don't have the key 'cause that's in my wallet, but I'll just... Well, no, 'cause my ID's there also and my money. So I don't have my ID or the money, but maybe they'll remember me. Hopefully, they'll remember me and... Dude, you're homeless. The reason why I'm not going home is because I'm recently divorced. Okay, then just stick around until things cool off, and then you can go get your wallet, get yourself a house or a new wife, whatever it is that you want to do. I do have a television. You can watch the news there on mute. - You have electricity? - Yeah, and water. See, I'm not homeless, just off the grid. I am offering you a safe place to hide out. Take it or leave it. Okay? I'm not gonna be begging. It's not like I enjoy your company or anything. "No foul play"? Do you see what that says? - Yeah. - Huh? You are officially free. Yes! Well, I... Thank you. Thank you. I will... I will get out of your hair now. That's it? So eager to walk out the door. No, no, I'm not. I... Are you cooking something? Just stir-fry. Nothing. Well, I like... Do you have any extra? To your innocence. Innocence. I do feel bad about Bjorn. Of course you feel bad. Well, 'cause he was... you know, he was not a horrible guy. He could be a... actually, a pretty nice guy sometimes. He let us wear shorts sometimes to work. You know, in-in the summertime. No, I understand. I mean... I understand how you must feel. You killed a nice guy that let you wear the shorts. And you think it's real. But you know what? You just have to observe the feeling and then let it go. I want to show you something really cool. Take this lighter. And you see those candles over there? Wave it at the candles. Well done. Oh, it wasn't that hard. Now try to do it without the lighter. You like that? Are you kidding me? Beautiful. Well, bravo. Now that you've created such a fantastic atmosphere, shall we dine? Do tell me about this dream home. It's just this persistent fantasy that I can't shake where I'm always drawing this... little abode that's on a peninsula, and I completely get lost in it. Show it to me. You have the drawings? Let's see. I'm impressed. It's very precise. Well, that's the thing. It's easy for me to do the detail, 'cause I see it so clearly in my mind. Right there's the path that leads out to just sort of like a little room that just has a great view of these mountains here. You love the pool. Yeah, that's part of an old ruin. And can you see the hotel right there? It has an observatory. The Hotel Pleiades. Pleiades. Yeah, that's a cluster of stars. In my mind, it feels real. I can see it. Greg, where do you think this is? Where is it? Well, it's right in the brain-powered mind of Greg Wittle. What? And who's this? Kind of forgot that one was in there. That is me. Look at her face. You drew me. Greg, this is not a fantasy. This is our real life, outside of here. No, come on. How can that be... But you know that... - Shh. - How... Did you... Let it be bigger than your comprehension. You're my guy. I'm your guy? You're my guy. Kiss me. So, what, your phone doesn't work anymore? Well, I knew you'd try to avoid me. We need to talk about Dad. I-I need your help. I-I want to find him. I want him to come to my graduation. Just let it go, Emmy, okay? Follow Mom's lead. No. I think it'd be good for him. Think it'd be good for all of us. Did he not bring your ass to, like, every baseball practice? I hated baseball. Who taught you how to skateboard? He did. I remember. I remember how many times he busted his ass trying to teach me shit and trying to impress me. I mean, I busted my ass, too, but he ate shit way more than a few times. So, can you just, like... hold on to that? Help me find him. I can't. Sorry. I just can't trust him anymore. "Hey, Dad, how's your back?" "It's okay. It's actually my knee that's bothering me." "Really? 'Cause I thought you fixed that already." - "Oh, no. You must be thinking about my shoulder." - Stop that. "Okay, your shoulder. Is it the left one or the right one, Dad? - "What about next week? Is your ankle gonna go?" - Stop it. - "Well, it's always something with you, Dad." - Stop it! Douchebag! - Hey! Creep. - Nice. Down! Judgmental bitch. Take her down. What? Do it. - No. - She's not real. Get her. Go! Yeah! Whoa. Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Oh, whoa! Watch out! I don't have to feel guilty about Bjorn! Cut through those illusions! Oh. Stop! There you go. Isabel. Hey. Ask me if I gave them my name. Ask me. - Did you give them your name? - No! - No way! Come on! - No! I didn't give them your name, either. They can't fuck with you - if you have no name, right? - They don't need it. You okay? I'm good. How do I seem? Good, right? Yeah. I'm a little disoriented, but in a good way. Don't worry about that. Hey, are you hungry? Let's go eat! - Hi. - Hi. Have you seen my dad? That's what he looks like. Haven't seen him. I think he might have been staying here a few weeks ago. No. Sorry. It's your turn. Come on. Wait up. Yo. - Hey, yo, D. - Yo. Thank you. No, I don't think so. Well, if you do see him, - will you please call me? - Yeah. - Thank you so much. - Yeah. We're organizing a march. Situation's gotten out of hand. Come if you can. Yeah, I'll be there. Get me a chicken sandwich and some fries, okay? I'll see you in there. You go ahead. - And a soda? - Yeah, and a soda. You got it. Yo, what can I get for you? Can I get two artisanal chicken sandwiches, two large fries and two sodas, please? That'll be 12.76. Uh, okay, my friend's got my money. Let me just... I think I'm just gonna go ahead and order later. Uh, all right. 'Cause I want to get everything together. Yeah, no problem. - It's just easier. - Yeah. No problem. I'll just get it later. You want to go out, honey? I need money. - Come here, cutie. - Hey, come here. Did you hear what I said? It's expired, but that don't mean much. We have to toss food after two hours on the shelf, so... - Okay, thanks. - Yeah. It's a little cold, but it's good. I don't mind cold food. Let's go find Kendo and get the amulet refilled. Well, that's the funny thing about accents is sometimes they can sound strong, depending on the region that you're in. But if you're not from that region, then it just... This is where you wait. I'll be back. - Here? - Yeah. Don't move. Hi, honey. Who's the new guy? Don't want to talk about it. He's cute. I'm here for some yellows. Fill it up. You really broke my heart. You know that. Get to work. I have real feelings. Hey, you want some mud? Junk? Skag? - Oh, no. No, no, I'm good. - Black pearl? - Gato? Caballo? - I'm all right. Hey, man, whatever. Your loss. ...instead of waiting around to collect government handouts... You sure he went west on San Fernando? I-I... No, I'm not sure. I never said I was sure. I see him. Sir, can you just pull over right here? And can you just wait for one minute? Dad? Dad. Emily? - Hi. - Oh, my gosh. How are you? What are you doing here? - I, um... - Is everything okay? Um... I'm sorry, it has been... it's been a crazy few days. I need you to come with me right now. - Okay? - Yes, of course. - Okay. - Gosh, yes. Yeah, sure. - Okay, come on. - No, but... Can we wait just a moment? I just... I'm just waiting for... I'm waiting for someone, for a friend. And then we're gonna go. Dad. Please. Hurry the fuck up, Kendo. I have to do this correctly. And I have places to be. Graduation. Oh, my God. I did not forget, and I'm definitely gonna be there. And I want to take you and Arthur to Cliff's Edge with your mother, if she'll allow it. I already graduated, Dad. What? Like two weeks ago. It's okay. It's okay. Here, I-I'm gonna... I have so many... ...thoughts I wish you could see. I'm gonna leave you with... Um, I'm gonna leave you with this. It's my phone number, okay? - Okay. - Just call me when you're ready. Is he real? Wouldn't you like to know. Who was that? Hey. Who was that? That's my daughter. Ignore her. She's not real. - Why would you say that? - Because it's the truth. What do you want me to say? I'm not making this shit up. Let's just get off the street and have some of this. Actually, I don't think I want any. I don't think I want to have any special powers right now. Fine, don't. It's not like anybody's twisting your arm or anything. No, I'm not saying that you are... You think you can just walk through my neighborhood tax-free? Don't worry about me, huh? I'm fine. I don't know about you, though. Don't walk away from me. Isabel, come on. - Here, give me one of those. - I thought you didn't want any. Yeah, people make mistakes. I made a mistake. Don't make me beg. Isabel, please, come on. Hey, hey, that's... That's all we have. Give me that. Oh, dude! Look at you. You're like the telekinetic warrior! Okay, Greg. Okay, it's okay, it's okay. Isabel! Isabel. Isabel! Think fast, Greggo. Oh, yeah. Good on you, bud. Hello. You've reached Emily. Leave me a message. Hey, it's Dad, and, um, I am, um, just trying to reach you. Um, you might not recognize this number. I'm calling from a pay phone. But I will try you back. I don't have my cell phone, so I'll try you back. All right, thank you. - Where the fuck were you? - Hey! I thought you left me! I... No, you weren't here when I woke up! I didn't know where you were! I-I left you a note! No, I didn't see any note. - What is this? - No, I didn't... - I didn't see that. - What is this? I-I did not see it. - "Be right back." - Yes, I didn't see it. "Kisses, hug, kisses, hug, Isabel. Love." I'm sorry. I went to... I went to get fertilizer for Ophelia. Okay. I... Yeah, when I woke up, I was yelling, "Isabel..." Where are the yellows? Uh, they... Somebody's been in our place, Greg. The-the-the yellows are missing. And-and they... they took the-the drawings of our house. No, no, I took those. I got 'em. They're right here. Look, I got 'em. They're right here. Why? Why did you... Why did you take them away? No, I... It's our memory of our house. - I just wanted to look at them. - Are you trying to forget? No, I'm not trying to forget. I just wanted to look at them. Did you take them because you're leaving? No! I didn't. I-I felt... I felt self-conscious having them there, 'cause it's like a... Did you see her? No. Tell me the truth. - I didn't see her. - Why you have that in there? - I-I did not... - Did you call her? No. I-I thought about it, but I didn't. I didn't... I... I didn't see her. I tried, but-but I-I... Why is it such a terrible thing? It's not supposed to be happening. Isabel... - I didn't see her. - I don't understand. I didn't see her. I'm really worried about you, Greg. - I'm really worried about you. - Okay. - You're... - I'm okay. You're getting sucked into the illusion, and you're dragging me in with you. I know this is not real, and I can barely breathe, and... And-and my stomach is turning, and my skin hurts, - and I feel like I'm drowning. - Isabel, it's okay, just... And I know this is not real. You are getting seduced by the simulation, and I'm losing you. I-I think maybe we should just stop hanging out. You're my soul mate. You can't just walk away and think that you can disconnect from me. If you could see the difference between what's real and what's illusion, you'd know that. And you're supposed to know that by now. How am I supposed to know? Y-You're the one telling me he's real and she's not real, and then I have to take your word for it, right? That's really your trick, is it forces me - to depend on you. - No. No, no, no. It makes me... It's very clever. It makes me believe in you. But guess what, I don't believe in you. I've never believed in you. How could someone believe you? Tell me something that makes me believe in you. - Show me something. - Okay. Okay, I get it. You... you have to see it for yourself. See what? We have to take a special kind of crystal, different from the yellows. They are very rare. I got them from Kendo. They're blue crystals. It's an exit mechanism. They will eject us from this simulation. We have to take ten each. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. One, two, three, four, five, six. Shit. Is-is that enough? Fuck it. We'll take the chance. Where-where did you get the measurement from? It's theoretical. I think we'll be fine. It has to be taken through the nose. Come. Come on, baby. We have to exit this stupid simulation. Is it safe? Kind of. Dr. Clemens, you okay? Yes, we're okay, Liang. Don't panic. We ejected the brainbox on purpose. Dr. Wittle formed an unhealthy attachment to an FGP again, and he was dragging me with him. Oh. And your exit mechanism? Blue algorithm, as expected. But this time, it was no easy task to get crystals. Thank God that Kendo has developed such a talent for finding them. Well, if you don't mind me asking, what did this one feel like? It wasn't war or extreme poverty, but, hell, it was icky. I'm so glad to... Be able to breathe this fresh air. - Please disconnect Dr. Wittle. - Okay. Hello, Dr. Wittle. You feeling okay? I feel okay. Well... this... should get your electrolytes up. Thank you. What is it? Lime Gatorade. Yeah. Easy does it. There we go. There's my guy. Welcome home. What's a FGP? Note the memory gap. You said "FGP." You were... Yes, it's short for "fake generated person." Only these volunteers are real. Did you save our incarnations? Mm, they're automatically in the cloud. Uh, shall I get it going now? Give us a couple of hours. I'm taking Dr. Wittle to lunch. Sounds good. I'll be here. Some FGPs are more convincing than others. What do you think? I think this place is overwhelming. Good overwhelming or bad overwhelming? Great overwhelming. What's with all the... What is with the-the hologram or the-the ghost people? Oh. Telepresence. It's all the rage these days. Hello, Dr. Clemens. Dr. Wittle. How's the research coming? It's getting there. Any problems we should be aware of? No. Lovely to see you. That was quite a look she was giving you. Any problems I should be aware of? Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm good, I'm good. Would you like to take the scenic route? Yes. Now, why am I not remembering any of this? Don't worry about it. Sometimes it happens to the volunteers. To some of them, anyway. It'll wear off. - Think fast, Greggo. - Hi. Oh. Good on you, bud. Mm! Oh, put that brain boner away. We got to get some olive oil. - Oh, no, Greg. - Yes. - No, we have gallons of it at home. - Yes. Home? I can't believe it. I told you. Hotel Pleiades. Yeah. What a fantastic name for a hotel that has its own observatory. "Play at ease." How did this whole world come to be? Your memory's not back. No. Is that bad? I was so scared to lose you. I made an irresponsible and stupid decision. We shouldn't have exited like that, without the appropriate dosage and... Maybe it might... it might not come back. Who cares? I love not remembering this place, because I get to discover it all again. I'm walking around just like a newborn, experiencing all of this beauty for the first time. I just want to know, is it... where did it come from? Has it always been like this? No. This place was actually much worse than the one we just exited. It got so bad. I mean, pollution was to a degree that people would just drop dead on the street, and the level of poverty was insufferable. It... I can't... Looking at this, I can't picture that. I mean, what happened? Three things. Just three things? - Mm. Yeah. - Okay. - Can you guess? - No. - Oh, come on. - I don't know. Automation, synthetic biology and asteroid mining. I wasn't gonna guess that. Oh, I have... Oh, wait. I'm gonna get your memory back. I'm gonna get your mem... I'm gonna trigger that memory. You're coming back. Watch this. I'm scared. Yes! Ta-da! The Thought Visualizer. You don't remember your baby? This is your invention. I invented that? Oh, it's, like, super popular in very small circles. Give it a try. What is it? A Thought... Visualizer. Okay, but I don't know what that is. Okay, introduce yourself. Hello. I'm Greg Wittle. Strawberries. A dinosaur... swimming in the ocean. A cheetah chasing a gazelle. A volcano. Oh, my favorite one. Do my favorite one. Say... "We're in a pickle." We're in a pickle. I love it. But you know what? This is not just a toy. It's amazing for illustrating things. Sit up straight and pay attention, Dr. Wittle. Science saved the world. Synthetic biology fixed all the environmental problems. And asteroid mining brought mountains of new money. And the guy that had the company for the asteroid mining... - That guy. - Yeah. He just started giving all this free money away. I mean, every single person here gets a base of 500,000K a year. And, of course, then the robots, they started doing all the boring and tedious tasks. We had the freedom and the time to explore our passions: science, art, whatever, whatever you wanted. We went from a broken world to a beautiful, sustainable, safe, peaceful Earth. You have to admit, this is spectacular. Yes. - But you know what? - What? The thing is that... it's amazing how easy humans can get used to even something spectacular. Most people say, "Ignorance is bliss," but I say... you have to experience the good to appreciate the bad. No, the other way around. Exactly. So that's where the brainbox comes from. It works. You really mean that? - Yes. - You really think it works? Look at me. I'm sitting here. I couldn't be more... I couldn't be more grateful. Greg. Let's go for a swim. - Oh, we can't. - Yes, we can. - No, we have to go back. - No. No, we have to go back to the lab. We will, in a little bit. Come on. No, I have to take this very seriously. I know. I'm taking it seriously, too. But you can't just give me a bite of an apple - and then show it and then take it away. - I already messed up. Give me another... give me another couple bites. - I already exited before it was over because of you. - I know. Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. We are gonna go back. We're just gonna just crunch into this apple for a few more days, and then we're going back. But first, we're gonna swim. Come on. I'm scared. Shut up. Just shut the fuck up. Just one day. One more day. That's it. Whoo! Careful. Is there a little bit of a shindig going on? - A what? - Soiree. A fiesta. Oh, yes! The mixer! Artists and scientists get together twice a month, and I forgot it was today. Oh, who's having the memory problem now, honey? Now, don't worry, it happens to some of the volunteers. - It should come back, hopefully. - Cállate. So, is this how you imagined it? Hmm? The Hotel Pleiades? Thanks. It's so nice, huh? Hi. Dr. Clemens. - Oh, Dr. Nye. - It's so good to see you. - Thanks for taking the time. - Yes. Hope you're having a good time. We're having a great time. You remember Greg? Dr. Wittle? - Yes, Greg. - Yes, we ordered one of your Thought Visualizers. It's a lot of fun. - Have you ever said to it, "I'm in a pickle"? - Yeah. - Have you ever done that? - We... It's so good. No, listen, "I'm in a pickle." - Next time, you try it. - Okay. It's amazing. - Well, you two look so good. - Thank you. - So do you. - Uh, thank you for taking the time. - Oh, this? - Yes. I throw it on when I don't care how I look. Now, carry on, you crazy kids. - Okay. - Thank you. - Enjoy. - Thanks. He got your Thought Visualizer. Wow. Oh, wow. Now I'm impressed. Maybe, just maybe, hell... is not such a horrible place. Whenever I hear about, "Oh, my God, boiling oil in hell," my first expectation is wild partying, barbecue, sexual orgies, alcohol, and so on and so on. What if this is the real life in hell? And what if, in hell, from time to time, some devil's representative comes to the people having a good time there and tells them, "Listen, guys, now we will be for a quarter of an hour observed by heaven, so please pretend that you suffer." - Hey, I'm glad I caught you alone. - Yeah. There's something I want to tell you. Word on the street is there've been problems with Isabel's research. You heard anything? You know anything about that? No, I... I've gotten a good feeling. Okay. We all want her to succeed, but this is her reputation on the line. What did he say? What did he want? What did he say to you? He said that everybody really wants you to succeed. - Really? - I don't think that's a bad thing that everybody wants you to succeed. Ah, then why didn't you tell me what he was saying? This is bullshit. You think I believe that? - You think I'm stupid? - Isabel, he came up to me... You think I don't know that these people are laughing at me? What the fuck are you looking at? Isabel. Isabel. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Nobody here believes in me. - They want you to succeed. - Yeah, right. Don't say "nobody here." I'm here. - You're taking their side! - Listen. I'm here, and I believe in you. Right? I believe in everything that you're doing. Your patience with me is a thing of beauty. Let's get out of here. My grandmother used to say, "The universe is sitting on the back of a tortoise." And I would ask Granny, "What is that tortoise standing on?" She replied with quite confidence, "Another tortoise. "And that one stands on another tortoise. And that one, another tortoise." It turns out it's turtles all the way down. I wouldn't go near him, ma'am. He could be unpredictable. It's a little cold. Was not expecting that. Complaining already. I'm fine. It's just chilly. I get one shot at this. One shot. I'm gonna show these arrogant, patronizing son of a bitches that access to the brainbox... It's a human right. Publish now. Stop being afraid. Just get it out there and let people decide then. We have to go back into the brainbox, Greg. I need complete data. We need to finish the cycle. You have enough data, Isabel. Not to mention the fact that I'm not going back in. Just stop doubting yourself. Why do you care so much what they think? Put it out there. They're gonna think it's great. And if they don't... And if they don't? Then here we are, right here, together. Weren't you telling me that we were soul mates? Would you let me interview you onstage? It would be my honor. Our presenter, Dr. Isabel Clemens, pioneered brainbox simulations, ugly, simulated worlds that users can jack into in order to generate appreciation for the real world. Dr. Clemens. Thank you very much. What is bliss? Bliss is not a feeling. It's not a place. Bliss is a state of mind that can only be achieved by understanding the contrast with the opposite state of mind. But the proof is in the pudding. Please meet my pudding, Dr. Wittle. Please take a seat, Dr. Wittle. Before we have a volunteer connected to the brainbox, we always ask a series of questions. And now I will ask Dr. Wittle the same questions so we can compare his responses to the previous ones. Dr. Wittle, how do you feel right now? I feel great. I'm happy to be here. And thank you for the nice reception. - Dr. Wittle... - Yes. ...how do you feel right now? Fine. Great. Yeah, sure. I mean, is that really the first question, or are we just bullshitting till you start? Any complaints, Dr. Wittle? No. None at all. I feel like I've died and gone to heaven. Without the dying part. Dr. Wittle... - Yes. - ...do you have any complaints? Other than being your lab rat? Just the usual ups and downs of life. Um... I mean, can I... should I be petty for a second? I'm a little frustrated. I can't get the pool temperature, you know, to work. I mean, how fucking difficult is it to get a pool heated to, uh, something where you don't feel like you're joining the Polar Bear Club when you jump in? Dr. Wittle, do you feel like you are lacking anything or anyone in your life right now? Dr. Wittle? Greg. I don't feel like I'm lacking anything. - Dr. Wittle. - Yes, Dr. Clemens. Do you feel like you are lacking anything or anyone in your life right now? That's a... that's a dumb question. I'm kidding. I'm just joking. Please answer and be honest. - That's how this works. - Okay. That's how this works. Um... yes. Yeah, there is something missing, but I don't want to talk about it. Well, as you can see, this once frustrated and grumpy man... ...is now a man full of wonder and... ...and appreciation and a hunger for tasting every breath of life. Thank you. Thank you. Congratulations, Isabel. You proved everybody wrong. Thank you so much. Listen, I read your thesis, and I'm gonna submit it to nature and science magazines and hope they put it on the cover. - It's fantastic. - Oh... - I don't know what to say. - Hang on. There may be a chaired position in your future. Oh, I have to tell Greg. Has anybody seen Dr. Wittle? - Thank you. - Sure. - Hey. - And for you, sir? Cabernet Sauvignon. Champagne. Wait. What... Excuse me. Wait, let me just say hello. - Dr. Clemens. - Hey. Where did the initial idea come from? What was the germ? - Yeah... - Yes, congratulations, Doctor. - Thank you. Thank you very much. - Lovely work. Um, I got to go find someone right now. Hey, please, just stop. I just want... I just want to hear your voice. Are... Are you really here in this place? Yes. I'm here with you. So you're real. Yes, I'm real. You're in Isabel's study? You're in Dr. Clemens' study? You're one of the volunteers? - My name is Emily. - No, I know. I'm Emily. I know who you are, but how are you out here in the real world? I'm your daughter. I-I know... I don't think I have a real daughter out here in the real world. Your name is Greg Wittle. You have a son and a daughter. Arthur and Emily. You're not thinking clearly because your head's not on straight. I've been to your tent, Daddy. It's okay. Yeah, it's just hard to figure out what's what. 'Cause it starts to feel like there's, like... it's almost like a trick being played. Um... When I was six, you, uh... you were tucking me into bed, and... I said, "Careful. Careful. I don't want you to mess up my braids." And you said, "My love, I can't mess up your brains. They're inside your head, protected by your skeleton." And I said, "No, my braids, Dad. My braids, not my brains." Braids. Braids. Braids, not brains. You remember. Yes, I remember. Dr. Clemens, tell us about the germ. What do you know about it? Dr. Clemens posits that these memory echoes from the brainbox world will fade away. They're just a side effect from not having enough blue crystals. One of these days, you're going to have to choose between these worlds, and maybe, somehow, to you, they're both real. So just... just... ...just do what's best for you, okay? - Greg! - Dr. Clemens! Isabel! Get off me! Isabel! Greg! Greg! Greg! Shit. Did you see that? I used the powers. But that's impossible. This shouldn't work here. Greg, this is really bad. Poverty's killing us! We have to get to the lab! We need more blue crystals. But why would we go back in? That's a terrible idea. We took eight instead of ten. But you said that was theoretical. It was just an estimate. Well, I guess I got that little fucking detail wrong, didn't I? No, you've got to explain anything to me! This is what I know. The brainbox cells must have worked their way into our head. It's as if we are bringing some of the simulation here with us even when we're disconnected. Okay, so how do we fix it? By taking ten blue crystals each. Liang, let's go. But don't they have crystals here in the lab? They don't exist out here. We need to go back. They're only manufactured inside of there. Dr. Clemens, there's a problem. The main brain gamma is low. Liang, we're leaving now! Well, I can only make it ride up for a couple seconds. Are you ready? Dr. Clemens, what about the study? Your mission? Shut the fuck up and press the button already! We'll deal with it later. Baby! Baby, we're back in. Come on. Let's go find Kendo. Kendo here? - You're not allowed in here. - Zip it. All right, you fake fucks. Where's Kendo? We need 20 blues. - No one's got blues. - Kendo will. Where is he? Hmm? - Where is he? - Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa. Let's start again. Where is Kendo? Hmm? Where is he? Hey. What are you doing alive? Hey, Bjorn! - Someone call security. - Okay. I'm gonna get it. Guys! I saw you fall out the window. He jumped out the window! You saw it, too! He fell right over there, - right out that window! - Should I, should I call... - Bjorn, look at me. - I'm out of here. Look at me. No, no, I'm calm. I'm calm. - Do you want me to call her? - You saw him. - Greg, get some food. - What are you doing? Don't do that to me! - Come on, come on, come on... - No, no. Just tell me why! - Here... - Now! Now! Move! Let's go! Come on! I found Kendo. Bjorn's alive. My boss is alive. - Did you see that? - Oh, my God. That's an FGP. They rebooted him! Come on. Kendo's at Doc Henry's? No, but our car is. Fake, fake, fake! Hello, beauties. Has anybody got some Tabasco? Tabasco? Bitch, what the fuck you talking about? Mace. For the bad boys. Get out of here with your fucked-up teeth. Give this bitch a toothbrush. Yeah, I got fucked-up teeth, but I also got a 20. Give it to me. Who has it? Fake, fake, fake, fake! Real! Hey, blondie, two for one. Hey. You in the mood? It's the only reason I come to this shithole. So, what is it gonna be? Uh, let's have a BJ and a finger in the butt. - Sure. - All right. - Let me get my lipstick. - All right. No, no, the wallet! The wallet! Yes! Blues! Here we go! Look what I found. Yes! Okay, philosophical question: Kendo's real, so if Kendo... if he... Yeah, Kendo is real, but if he dies here, he doesn't die out there. I'm not gonna do anything to him. Stop looking at me that way. Dr. Clemens. Kendo, we need blue crystals. I don't have time to explain it to you, but shit's falling apart one level up. - Give them to me. Go get them! - Okay. Okay, sure, you got it. Go get them! - Now! - Okay. I have them on me, right here... Ah, fuck! Dr. Clemens, what are you doing? - Hey. Hey! - I thought he went for a gun, but he actually did have them. - Sorry, Kendo. - Sorry? I mean, it starts to feel like you're making this up as you go along, that... He's fine. Maybe just a mild stomachache, but he's fine. Police! - Go! - Hold it! - Stay where you are! - Go this way! Stop! This is fake. This is fake. This is fake. Come on, can't you run faster? This is way too much running. Can't we just take the blues here? No, we need to get the device to take it through the nose. We need to get to the tarp home. Why didn't we get it before we started shooting people? Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Okay, okay. I got a call. He was panhandling outside of his old office. Will you come with me, please? I need you. We need to take ten each. There's not enough! What do you mean? - There's not enough! - Count 'em again. There's not enough! - Come out with your hands up. - What? We're so fucked! Oh, my God. Okay, what does it mean? - We're fucked. - Yeah, what does it mean? We're so fucked. It means that one of us gets to go home - and the other one gets stuck in this place. - Why? No, no. - I'm not staying here. - We go to... - to jail and-and... - No. No, no, no, no. - ...for good. - Listen to me. I have to go. Okay? I can't stay here. Don't worry. It's okay. It's okay. We see you behind the tree. - You-you take it. - Okay. And you're gonna be okay, right? Okay. I'm gonna... - Maybe we can split it. - Go, go. No, no, it won't work. Go, go. Come on. I have an idea. What if you kill me? Yeah. Look. Take this. Just crush my skull, and then I meet you back there. - I'm not staying here. - That's bullshit. I'm not gonna do that. - Why? - What if it doesn't work? What about Kendo? Maybe I killed him. I don't know. I-I don't... I don't know what to believe. Oh, shit. Fuck. We're fucking surrounded? Down there! Get your men down there! Let's go! We're in a pickle. We're in a pickle, baby. Yeah, we're in a pickle. Okay. Let's go. You're not coming? I'm-a be right here. I'm here for you. Thank you. Fuck! Shit. This is horrible. This is... this is a fucking nightmare. It's my fault. I created this. I created this shit. Just me. But it's also kind of beautiful. It is. Look, I mean, even with the cops coming and with us running and just... You know, everyone's playing their part, and we're all... like, we never know how it's gonna end. One minute, we're roller-skating and laughing. Remember? Yeah, and then the next minute, can't even afford a sandwich, and then the next minute, you never know. That's what I love about here and what you created. You don't know what's gonna happen. It's fucked-up. And it's great. And I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. Dad! Dad! Dad! Keep an eye out! Stay back! Stay back! - No! No, no, no! Please wait! No, wait! - Come on, go. - Get in the car. - Wait! Wait! Dad! I'm sorry. She's beautiful. Go. Hey! Come on, motherfuckers! Let's go! Drop what's in your hand. Ma'am, show what's in your hand. Hands in the air. Let me see your hands. This is, uh, Greg's first time. Welcome, Greg. In this house, there's no stigma for what you're going through. Every person on this planet can relate to wanting to chase bliss. It's an open forum, so you can say anything you want. We're here to listen. This woman says she's my daughter. And I believe her. Hi, Dad. Sorry I'm late. I... I saw these flowers on the side of the road. I thought they looked nice, I guess. You're not late, Dad. You're here.
