- [Voiceover] The way I see it, you can write your congressman, sign a petition, get on a bus, and million man march in Washington. Or stuff envelopes, volunteer, register swing voters in swing states. Shit, you can quit your corporate job and sign up to teach poor kids on a bus. Do relief work in some war torn country, get on some back to nation trip and live off the grid in Vermont, eating bark and wiping your ass with oak leaves. Whatever it is, you'll probably convince yourself it's all good, drift off to sleep at night, thinking, "I'm doing my part." See, that's what the myth's built on, the one we all got spoon fed in grade school. Idea that the little man can make a difference, pull himself up by the bootstraps, you know, do something positive. That shit's been hardwired into every one of our little American hard drives. Except, maybe, I picked up a virus along the way. Got some worm in me that's just been digging and digging and erasing and organizing because that myth just wasn't working out. I started asking myself, I started thinking that maybe the only way to really get at the truth, the only way to really shake things up, is to have the establishment come face to face with the barrel of a gun. (ominous music) - I'm waiting on something, Senator. - Can we at least cover my privates? Can we do that at least? - Why don't we try answering the question first, Senator? - Christ. I'm losing circulation here. - Would you keep your voice down? - Voice down, I'm naked, I'm tied to a goddamned chair. How much longer you gonna... I get it, OK, you got me, I'm quiet as a church mouse. - Now you can continue when you're ready. (chatter) - Was it a face to face meeting and how did you actually meet him? - Well, as mentioned, I've been conducting research on the hacker community. And I made contact through some of my connections. And no, it's not a face to face situation. (chatter) Miss. - But is it really viable? Does this individual believe that he can actually undermine the system in some fundamental way, that criminal activity like this might actually evolve into a legitimate political platform? (typing) (beeps) - I was asked to read a prepared statement. Before I do, I'd like to direct everyone's attention to the confess website. Which apparently was just updated. (ominous music) (beeps) - I support jobs in South Carolina over sending aid to some Arab who's gonna blow us all to kingdom come. - OK, fair enough, but that's not what I asked you, Senator. - No, you listen to me. Why should we care, huh? I'll ask you that. As a US senator from South Carolina, why should I give a shit about sending aid to Mexico or somewheres else when I've got some tobacco farmer lost his job, he can't make his truck payments, he's losing his house, his wife is gonna leave him, so why the hell should I care? Huh? I mean, if they're starving in them other places, let 'em starve. If they hump monkeys in the jungles of Africa and get AIDs, then that's their cross to bear. Look, could we cover up my goddamned genitals? (chatter) - Thank you. So, here we go. The confess project is about giving a voice to truths that are rarely heard. (hip hop music) - This is the normal verse, you understand that? We all ride this. - They are going to treat you, so how can you say that 40,000,000 people are uninsured? Come back here and talk. - Keep it real means keep it real fucking broke. - You think this is power? - There are a few things I'd like to go over with you. - Vinny, he's not with me, get him out of the car. - Come on guys, I look like a goddamned computer department to you?

Shit, coming out of high school, I basically swept the academic awards. All the prizes. Excellence in science and technology, national merit scholar, future leaders award, engineer, promise prize. It was basically like the crowning moment. The end result of my mamma enrolling me in every after school program out there, give me that computer early, always deferring gratification shit. You know, play by the rules. Bring an apple to your teacher. Double check, triple check that homework. Don't get caught up in stupid teenage shit. It was all about keeping my eyes on the future payout. The full ride to a top college. The high paying job. A house and a mortgage. Doing better than my dad had. I got championed by teachers. By boosters who wanted to be part of a story about at risk kid with smarts. (jazzy music) - [Voiceover] Some employee's gonna pay some high school drop out to hack into a company server and bring down a whole business, and that's where we fit in. Safe circle... - Hello? Someone up there? - Fuck. (gasping) - Oh come here, come down here. (laughs) How come you didn't call me and tell me you were coming back? I would have picked you up at the airport. - Well, I know, but I just took a bus, and, you know, I didn't have the exact time I was coming home. - A bus, from Mexico? - Yeah, part time. - What, you run out of money? Look at you. You look so different. You're older, with your dreads all long. Oh, sweetie. - Mom, Mom, Mom. - OK, OK, OK. I can't help myself. So, you gonna be here for a while though, huh? - Well, in the city, you know, just here to take care of some stuff, just to work some things out. - You gonna stay here though, right? - No, I'm gonna be staying in the city. But you know, I'll come through, I'll come see you. - OK, OK. - Are you OK? - I'm good. I'm fine. - All right. - You're not gonna stay right now? - I can't, Mom. - [Mom] Well can't we just go get something to eat or something? - Look, I just got to go meet this guy later and I'll be back later on in the week, OK? - [Voiceover] First mover advantage is key. Gotta stress that, remember that, Terrell, I gotta stress that, now first mover advantage and its impact on market share. Now, you gotta mention Gato, Amazon, Mission Import, the big boys, that's what we're gonna be. (hip hop music) - So, we start you off at eight and a half beans an hour, and that's policy, but you listen, all right now, you do good work, OK, I get positive feedback, we'll see about throwing you a little more in a month or so. (sirens blaring) - You promised to e-mail me everyday, once it's up and running. Of course, there's a four hour time difference, isn't there? Or is it three? Three. - [Voiceover] Look, we all know the girl has no talent, so why don't we just package her on her looks, the lifestyle...? - Exactly, the evolution from down and out, reconnecting with the millionaire father. - That's it, right? You're finished? I can get on it now? - He's at Stanford, full scholarship. Did I already mention that? - I started out here three years ago. All right, I worked installation. But I busted my balls and I proved myself and now, I'm in management. - So, that's it, right? You're finished, I can get on it now? What? - How many times you gonna ask me that question, man? - [Kid] Yeah, yeah, yeah, but... - Did you bring it to them on time? All right. Tomorrow, 8:00 AM, I got you on around six calls, a richie rich uptown, that PR firm and a couple of geriatrics in Queens. - I guess we should go with the eating disorder thing, yeah, I think that'll play really nicely, her getting it under control, finding herself, whatever. - [Voiceover] Very human, touching. - I can connect it, it's easy, I know how. Yeah, yeah, you just have to do it, I'll show you. - OK, OK, listen, kid, you really need to chill out, OK? - You listen to me, he fixates, OK? He has a disorder, he's special needs, OK? Now you gonna answer his questions? Are you gonna tell him how long, you gonna tell me how long? Because I'm late for my trainer. - OK, look, all right, it's my bad, you know, I was almost finished anyway. Look, all I was doing was installing this webcam, which I'm throwing in for free because I made you late and I messed up your schedule. As a matter of fact, let me show you this. Now, with this webcam, you're gonna be able to shoot pictures and short video clips. (typing) Stuff like this. Enjoy. - Are you gonna tell him how long, you gonna tell me how long? It's a disorder, he's special needs, OK? Now you gonna answer his questions? Turn it off. You know what, I'm calling your boss. - You humiliated her, you humiliated her son, you were late. I'm gonna have to fire you, hey, you can't leave with the shirt and the hat, hey. - Excuse me. There seems to be something wrong with my door. - Credit card number you left got canceled. Was it even yours? - Here you go. - It's a good start, but you owe 83.25. - Come on, man, I don't get paid until the end of the week, man. - Yeah, me too. - OK. - Hey, you can't come in here. - Get the fuck out of my way. - Hey, you can't come in here. - What you gonna do? - [Voiceover] OK, so, when they're telling you the classic stock of the company you start is gonna be worth 1.75 million the minute the company goes public, you're 19, you're the fucking man, the geek turned celebrity, the quiet kid in the corner who's gonna be rolling up in a fucking Benz next week. You start turning down the full ride scholarships, you're feeling good about it. MIT, well thanks, but no thanks. Carnegie Melon, maybe next time. Stanford, I'll take that honorary doctorate in a couple years and get that shit ready for you. You start promising your mom a new house, new car, telling her she'll be able to quit that shitty ass job and take that trip to the Bahamas she always used to talk about. (melancholy music) (chatter) - OK, die, yeah, yeah, die, yeah. OK. Yeah, yes, yes, yes. Never saw that coming, did ya? - I mean, stuff was changing. They sold the division, I don't know, basically it was the same routine, pretty much the same as ever. - So what happened next? - Out of the blue, two weeks notice. Just like that. - Hold up. Explain it, what happened? - Yeah, can you believe it? No severance, nothing, just letters in our boxes one morning. I mean, is that right? Two weeks notice after 14 years? This is where we're headed with this new economy or whatever they're calling it. And after we've been through all that with the retirement accounts. - What about 'em? - Basically they forced us to keep our retirement in company stock. - So what happened, did the company went under or what? - No, after they laid people off, I heard they did fine, had a profitable year. So, you got something lined up? You should have no problem, at least you have marketable skills. Hey, maybe you could call Greg Batenbelle, whatever it is you call him now, huh? - Worry about your own problems, OK? - My own problems, huh? I'm behind in everything, OK? I had to sell the car. The house is falling apart. Temp work is two, three days a week at best. I don't know, Terrell, when I was 20 years younger, had big breasts... - What are you talking about? - It wasn't just downsizing. He's a pig, you should see them, these vulnerable, desperate types. - Who, I mean you're talking about your boss? - Yes. Everyone knows what's going on. (phone ringing) - Can I help you? - Yes, I was just doing routine upgrades. - Sarah let you in here? - Yeah, she did. - Well, I'm expecting a conference call, she should know that, reschedule. So sort it out with her, OK? - Yeah, OK. (phone ringing) - Do you understand? - Right, I understand, but I... - [Mom] Is that right? Two weeks notice after 14 years. Two weeks notice after 14 years. - We might possibly be able to work something out. (moaning) (laughs) - Mr. Connors, I was wondering about that phone. - We might be able to work something out. After hours occasionally. After hours occasionally. Oh, yes. You like that? Working late tonight. You're gonna get a nice big one. Big Christmas bonus. Christmas. - I've been working really hard, really hard. - She does what she's told, doesn't she? (moaning) Sugar bonus. You can go now, Sarah. Go now, Sarah. That's fine. - [Voiceover] Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Newton's third law. You know, I liked that shit the day I first read about it in grade school. I was convinced it could be like some guiding principle of my life. But as I got older, it just, it got less and less true. 'Cause it just doesn't tell you shit about dealing with people. No equation or code could ever factor in all the jealousies, fears, guilt, the ego. That shit's more like rolling dice. (beeping) - What is this? - Titties. (beeping) - Damn. Been a while, right? - Yeah, it's definitely been a while. - Hey, it's good to see you, man. - Man, you, too. - How you doing, hey. Let me show you around. - Oh, yeah, yeah, cool. - Just picked up a new server. - Oh, shit. - I got it about a month ago. You remember all that? It's obsolete shit now. Come on. I don't even know where to begin. - Me neither. - History. - So, do you really want to talk about history? - Yeah, OK, go ahead. - You ain't got anything to say? - If it's an apology you're looking for, no. No, I don't. So, since then, since then, where you been? - Doing my own thing, travel. Looks like you're doing all right. - Surviving. - Look, man. Do you think it's possible that you could slide me in on something? - You serious? - Yeah. I need to help my mom out. - It's ugly out there, right? - Tell me if you got part time or whatever you got. You know I can do it. - They're all nervous, anxious, trying to protect their proprietary applications, they've been hacked three or four times in the last year. Typical financial service company. Colombian grad student fishing around for a sexy topic for a thesis, she comes in and interviews all the time. Check this out, she's the daughter of some congressman from Connecticut. Come on, I'll introduce you. Everybody, this is Terrell. A dinosaur you may have heard him, he used to go by Blaze. - You serious? - Seriously, you should interview this guy, get that historical perspective. - I'd love to. Hi, I'm Olivia. - Hey. - Yeah, I'm doing my dissertation on hacker culture. The ethics, motivations. - Hey, what's this you guys are watching? - It's this clip that was posted this morning. It's a video of a CEO getting on with his secretary. - Yo, this shit is fucked up. - They just gave a press conference, I guess the board forced him to resign. - Check this shit out. - She's a good girl, she does what she's told. - It definitely has a to it. - I see it right here on the website. Yes, that's the one I want, the scarf. The angora scarf. Yes, that's the one I want, the scarf, the angora scarf. Why is this so difficult? I have informed you that yes, that's what I want, the scarf, the angora scarf. (hip hop music) - Hey, you're up early. - Yeah, working. - That's great, what is it? - Wall Street Hornton. - No, come on, seriously, what is it? - System security, I'm working for your power grade depend. - You see, you see that, didn't I tell... Well. Sounds good. - Yeah, well, should be able to help you out now. - I don't want to be some kind of... - Oh, come on, Mom, stop that. - Get you some breakfast. - No, no, I'm fine. OK? Just relax. - I know, but listen, when you do have a moment, I'd love to catch up, hear about your travels, what you're up to. - OK, I will. For now I gotta go. - Go on, then. Good luck. - [Voiceover] See, if you ain't wearing the right Works Brother tie, or you don't got the right Uncle Tom MBA from Harvard, then you're just another bike messenger delivering shit. But see, if you flip it, hold the mirror up to them, then see who perceives what. See how they come across when they ain't focus grouped, Photoshop isn't in their most flattering light. (hip hop music) - You stop pussy footing around and pull the goddamn trigger? Guy's a fucking retard. Yeah, yeah, what can I do for you? - System security, Terrell Lussen. - And? - And I'm not sure what you mean. - Come on, guy, do I look like a goddamn computer department to you? - Well, I thought because the receptionist just told me that you were the person I was supposed to see. - Down the hall, all the way down the hall on the right. On the right side, you'll see Tim Bellweather's office. He's the head egghead. - Thanks. - Fucking morons. - Excuse me, did you just say something? - What? - I could have sworn you just said something. - God, what are you talking about? - Did you say something? - What, you want me too? You're a frigging nutjob, OK, and by the way, nice frigging outfit, what is this, dress down Tuesday or something? You know what, have a little self respect, son. (hip hop music) - What the fuck are you doing? - I'm working. - They're threatening to drop the contract. They're one of my biggest clients. - The guy's an asshole, man. - Look, undermine you're own shit, OK? But I did you a favor. - Oh, come on, man, don't act all innocent. Don't act like I don't know how you get your clients in the first place. - You don't know shit, OK? - You're right, I don't know shit. - Look, I know you're still upset about Safe Circle, OK? I was upset, too. But you have got to get over it. - Oh, man, come on, man, are you done? - No, I'm not. My clients don't have shit to do with what happened, OK? You can't fucking lash out at people. Why don't you take it up with Heston if you're so pissed off? (hip hop music) - No, evaluation's off, way off. Check last year's numbers again, yeah, hold on a second. Yeah. - 'Sup, man, how's it going? - Do I know you? - I don't know, do you? - Look, buddy, what do you want? I'm on the phone. - So, you haven't a good one? - What? - Are you having a good day? A successful day. - Charles, let me call you right back. Do I know you? You worked at the club, right? - Yeah, the club. Maybe that's it. So, what's up, man, did you fuck anybody out of their idea today? - What? Who the hell are you? - I'm just interested in whether you made bank off of someone else's sweat? - Bank. - Yeah, bank. You know, I'm just interested, I mean, did you out contract anybody today? (laughs) - No, no, actually I didn't. But if I had, I certainly wouldn't discuss it with someone like you. - Yeah, how come? I mean, do you like keeping the common man in the dark? - The common man, is that what you are? - Well, I guess you got me pegged there, buddy, right? Well, I got to be going, man, I got to get back to the club. - [Voiceover] No, see, when it's in their best interests, they'll play like they're you're best buddy for press. They told me I was God's gift, acting like I be playing golf with them every Sunday at the country club, going on dates with their society daughters. But see, there's a fine print in those contracts. That's the shit you're blind to when they're wining and dining you, talking stock options. And while you're blinded by the glitz and glamour, they keeping their eyes on the end game. Which basically involves sucking you dry of all the tech know how you got, and then kicking you to the curb. - They were the size of watermelons. - Yo, homie. - Fake. - Yo, yo. I got a couple more questions for you. How much is it that you make, anyway? - Hold on a second. Are you following me? - I mean, you make a good living, right? - I'm comfortable, yes. Now get the hell out of my face. Steve, I'm gonna have to call you back. - I'm sorry, man, what's your name again? - Cindy, it's Richard, where's the fucking car? There's no one down here. - Richard, Richard, OK, OK, and what is it that you do again? Oh, come on, man, look. I work at the club, I moonlight as a messenger sometimes, so what is it that you do? Are you like a bond trader or something? - I'm a VC, a venture capitalist. - That's right, you are. It's coming back, it's coming back. - OK, listen, asshole. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. And I don't have the time. So fucking leave me alone. - All right, it's cool man, I hear you. Oh, oh, except for one thing, man. You say comfortable. What exactly does that mean, because I mean, how much is that, is that like a million, a million five, 2,000,000, I mean, say when when I get there. 3,000,000? Oh, come on, man, what, you're embarrassed to say it out loud? If you want, you could write it down, you know? Send me a little note. So. - What the fuck are you doing? Vinny, get him out of the car, he's not with me. - Sir, can you please step out of the car? - Hold on, I got a few more questions. Do you think it's fair that you make all this cash all from other people's ideas? - All I know is I work hard for the money I make. Now leave me alone. - OK, OK, God chill, chill man. I just wanted to chat. You know? You could have asked me questions, too, made this sort of a two way sort of thing. 'Cause you just might be interested in my background. And in what we have in common. You have a good day. - I'm comfortable, yeah. The common man. The common man. Is that what you are? - I guess you got me pegged there buddy, right? Well, I got to be going, man, I got to get back to the club. - [Richard] I'm comfortable, I work hard for the money I make. A venture capitalist. - Good morning. You know what, man, I'm not totally satisfied. - The hell's the matter with you? Fuck. - I don't know, I guess I'm just still fixated on what someone like you makes. You know, your salary. So, come on, Rich, how do you feel? - Don't you fucking touch me. If I fucking see you again, I will kick your fucking ass, do you understand me? Do you understand me? - Yes, I do understand you. Shit, man, you don't need to get violent with me. I was just asking questions. - Shut up. Where do I know you from? - See, I thought you'd know, but I guess we all look kind of similar, don't we? So, you grew up with cash, right? - No, no. I grew up middle class, now get the fuck out of here before I call security. - You grew up middle class, like Donald Trump grew up middle class, is that what you're trying to say man? Shit. - I see you again, you're fucking dead. 2,000,000, OK? I made $2,000,000 last year, that satisfy your twisted little fucked up mind? More than you'll ever make in a lifetime, all right? - So, you give to charity, right? - Charity. As a matter of fact we do, we give to charity. Benefits, we go to benefits all the time. So little black kids don't end up becoming real fucking freaks like you. - Fuck 'em if we do, right? Just like that Safe Circle deal. - Cindy, it's Richard, where's the fucking car? It's the car, OK? As a matter of fact we do, we give to charity. I'm comfortable, yes. I'm a VC, a venture capitalist. I made $2,000,000 last year. You understand me? A bonus of three and a half million. I grew up middle class. You work at the club, right? Is that who you are, the common man? As a matter of fact, we do, we give to charity. Benefits, we go to benefits all the time. (yelling) So little black kids don't end up becoming little fucking freaks. Are you following me? I'm a VC. You understand me? I'm comfortable, comfortable venture capitalist. I make more than your sorry ass will ever make in a lifetime. - Do you see what I'm saying? - Well, it's captured something. Some genuine sentiment but it certainly doesn't constitute a model yet. - OK, right. But think of the implications for environmental activism, anti globalism efforts. - Now. - Professor, WTO protests. - Wait a second. If you want to construct your thesis around internet activism or even hacker culture, that's good, that's fine, it fits well within the department's perview. But this is, it's scattershot. You need to be patient. You know, see how it plays out. See if the media gets behind it. Propagates with the more radical communities, right? - Right. Thank you so much for your time. - Look, Olivia, here's the real issue. These people, this person, whomever it is, what they're doing is only relevant if you or somebody else makes it relevant. Otherwise, it's just fleeting digital chatter. Random noise, right? - Right. (tense music) - OK, so you did know him. - Right, but didn't figure it out 'til later. His hair is different. Turns out he was a minor player in a deal my friend structured a number of years back. - Structured, meaning what? - We provided seed capital, eventually assumed the managerial oversight. - And the deal went sour. - Depends, depends who you talk to. - You forced him out. - No, look. They developed this surveillance technology. Very sophisticated, but had no clue, absolutely no idea how to grow a company. Horrible people skills. He was 19, maybe 20, tops. - Mr. Heston, please, was he asked to leave or did he go voluntarily? - Asked. He was asked to leave. But he was compensated, he was paid for the programming work he did. - There we go. Have you seen this? - Yeah, just not this particular article. - What do you think? - I'm not sure yet, you? - It's not as tight as it could be, the concept, but I think that it's got potential. - Tight. - Yeah, it could be stronger thematically. I think that it could be a real mode of critique. - So, what do you want to know? - I guess let's start with some background information. Tell me about growing up, being a part of the hacker community, how you got involved in it. - Well, I was your classic latchkey kid. My mother really wanted me to do better for myself, so she got me a computer. And then, why are you so interested in all this? - Let's stick with you. - I thought this was a conversation. - OK, so, when did you first start accessing systems? Accessing information that wasn't yours? And what did it feel like that first time? What? - Greg tells me I can trust you. - Yeah, you can. - Why? - Because you can. It's just a fact. - Stop. You want to know something? I know this guy. - Don't even joke. - I'm not joking. I grew up with him. It's a small community. - Do you think you can set me up with him? You think you can get me an interview? - Maybe, why? - One more of these, if it's done right, and it's front page, this is prime time news. - Excuse me, what do you mean done right? - OK. One thing that I've been thinking about. Can you imagine if you were to reconfigure the sites that had a more decentralized structure. Like, a structure that lets others submit their confessions, too. Stuff that they've forced from people. Seriously, I need to talk to this guy. - OK. Why don't you let me borrow that camera for like a day or two? - OK. - Maybe I can get him to video himself talking or something. - Yeah, take it. (contemplative music) - Get your shit and get out. - Man, what are you talking about? - I don't know you. I haven't seen you in years. - Where'd you get this? - I downloaded it. It's everywhere. - What, you felt the need to Google me first thing in the morning? - What did you do? - [Terrell] Nothing. - Well, I hope you can understand why I can't have you here because I can't jeopardize my whole shit. - OK, man, you know, it's not the first time this shit has happened. - Oh, man, don't fucking go there again. Man. Come on, look, I know when Safe Circle imploded that I did not respond properly. - Respond properly, are you kidding me? You just sat back and watched me get pushed out. You didn't do anything, you didn't respond at all. - Yeah, and then I got pushed out the door two months later. You should be happy that you got out when you did. - Because you built this place up by yourself, right? From nothing. Yeah, I should be happy. - Look. Look. - Get out of my way, Greg. - I just want you to know that if it starts to look really bad and you really need something, I don't know. Money or something, I'll do what I can to help you. - Excuse me. (chatter) (doorbell ringing) - Hi, Miss Lessor? - Yes. - Agents David and McAllistor, FBI. We'd like to speak with you about, is it your son? Terrell Lessor? - Yes, is he OK? - That's what we need to speak to you about, Miss Lessor, it seems he's in a bit of trouble. - We're gonna have to ask you to come with us, ma'am. Apologies for that. I also have a warrant here to search your premises. - Come on, you bitch. That's right, look at me. Yeah. All right. - Come on, come on, yeah. - That's the one I want. That's the one I want. - Fuck. - [Kid] OK, die. - [Woman] Yes. Yes, that's the one I want. - OK, yeah, OK. - Yes. (laughs) Why is this so difficult? - OK, die. - I see it right here, that's the one I want. - OK, yeah, yeah. - Yes. Scarf, the angora scarf. Item 4122, yes, that's the one I want. - Never saw that coming, did you? - Mexico. Maybe it's Mexico. I remember him saying he'd been traveling. I think he blames me for always pushing. I pushed him too hard all the time. - It's obvious that he had options. It seems clear. - You know they forced them out? Literally came into work one morning and they escorted him out of the building. - We're aware of this, Miss Lessor, it's documented. - It's what happened after that, where we need your help. Now, maybe Mexico isn't quite the level of detail that we're looking for. - No, uh uh, unless you tell me what you know. What happened to him? Get a lawyer. I walk out. - Actually, you won't, Miss Lessor, the things is, as a material witness, under the anti-terrorism legislation, we're at liberty to keep you... - Jim. Why don't you get us a round of coffee? I'll take a bran muffin. Miss Lessor, is there something we can get you? Apologies, ma'am. As you can imagine, the agency's overworked these days. It impacts some of us more than others. - Let him know we have a file on him as a juvenile, remind her that we know about the bank hacks and the DOD of '93. - Here's my read on the situation. Terrell's gonna end up in prison sometime soon. Now, I'd wager, based on not that many years of experience, but I'd wager, that computer skills won't do much for him in maximum security. Day to day. Survival wise. - Look, Miss Lessor, the bottom line is if we can get to Terrell before someone gets hurt, gets killed, there's a chance we might be able to work something out. But in order for that to happen, you're gonna have to help us. We're gonna need you to give us a name. Anything to help us find your son. Now we're gonna step out for a minute. You think about it. Write something down. Anything. Something for us to go on. At this point, it's in Terrell's best interest. (melancholy music) - Can you believe these people? - Yeah, except they're more like victims. It's not like the businessman on the bus fucking his secretary. People are going to think that this is depressing. - What? What makes these people victims? - What did they do? - Come on, man, look at this guy, come on. - He makes a stronger case when they come across as crass or arrogant. He shows that they've manipulated people's lives for their own benefit. - OK, hold on. All right. Got something for you. I got him to answer your questions. - You said that you hadn't seen him. - Yeah, no, but then I saw him after we talked. Now look, don't get too excited. He had to run, so it's kind of short. - Wait. I can't hear what you're asking him. - I'm asking him your questions. - I have targets in mind, people, dates, places. Political figures. - What, what are you doing, what are you doing? - That's so fucked up. What, I mean, do you really think that I wouldn't recognize you? You have the same voice, you're wearing the same fucking necklace. Get your shit and get out. - OK, wait, wait, wait, hold up. - This isn't some fucking joke to me. - It's not a joke to me, neither. OK, I'm serious, this is actually me. - You know what, just get the fuck out of my house. - OK. All right, I can show you the site, I can show you the footage, I got it all on top of my laptop, all right? Now look, you know what I was working on earlier today? I was working on this whole idea where others can submit their own footage to the site, you know, kind of like a whole submit section. Your idea. - So, the dread thing? - Yeah, that hurt. - She did say you did look good. (ethereal music) Come on, I just fucked you. God, at least give me a hint. Well. I have some ideas, too. I think that we should generate a list. Target individuals that represent larger themes. Sort of like societal archetypes, you know? - That's good, good. - You just saying that? - No, no, I mean, you know, hey, it's basically going in that direction, anyway. - Yeah. Hey, do you need money for anything? - What? - Because you were saying something about not wanting to work for Greg anymore. - Yeah, I'm definitely not working for Greg anymore. Are you serious? - Yeah. - OK, well, I could use some extra equipment for the next one, but I'm gonna need, maybe a thousand man, that's only if you can spare that. - Done. (hip hop music) - Let's go. - This is a story about a sell out. The cracker, Glenace Bennett. Fits all their expectations. Policy advisor to the president of the United States of America. Let me tell you something, I have a voice on the national stage. This is jut another story that the media is gonna love feeding white America. They're gonna love it. How can you feel so disenfranchised that you cannot voice your complaints through legal channels, democratic channels, I'm talking about voting booths, I'm talking about the free press. The administration firmly believes... This is a story about a sell out right now. Right now, right now. - This coward, wherever he is, will be rooted out and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. ♪ What you say, what you say? ♪ I missed that ♪ What you say, what you say? ♪ I missed that ♪ What you say, what you say? ♪ I missed that ♪ What you say, what you say? ♪ I missed that - It's exactly what you get when you cross a cyber geek with a rabidly misguided liberal.

(hip hop music with fast rapping) - What, what happened? - Nothing happened, baby. It's OK. - Come here, girl. - Come on, it's time to get up. It's time to get up. (calm music) Hey, I need to show you something. - What? - The submit section. Terrell, people are starting to post their own. Come on. - Go, go, go, go. - Fuck, get the fuck out. What are you doing, man? What? (yelling) Eight or nine, maybe 11 on the highway, I don't know. - [Voiceover] You like the outdoors, you like nature? - Yeah, yeah, I hunt, I fish. - [Voiceover] But you don't see a connection between driving one of these and environmental degradation, global warming. You don't think driving a fucking tank compared to this country's foreign policy? Oil? - Yeah, I do. - [Voiceover] Get out of the car. - You're not gonna believe this shit, watch this. - [Voiceover] Go. (explosion) - God, do you see how we're expanding? Making linkages. God, all one shot, notice that, unedited. We do it like that and we avoid criticism that we got with Bennett about manipulating the footage. - I don't think I should have opened up like this. - What are you talking about? The site becomes a place where people invent, they form alliances, they congregate, they expose all the... - Oh, God, give it a rest. - What's your fucking problem? - You sound like a chapter from your thesis. I'm just saying, this whole thing is a bit out of control, OK? - OK. OK. So, we regain focus at the press conference. I sent out the releases. It's happening. You're still going tonight, right? - Me? - Yeah, I told you that I wanted to be there this time. I wrote up some questions. - No, there is no we tonight. - Why, I am involved. You know, if you get caught at this point, we're both fucked. I'm backing you on this shit and you're gonna keep me out of the most crucial fucking part? Are you listening to me? Fuck. I can just do it myself and submit my own material. OK. OK, well, are you at least gonna write the statement? - It's a bad idea. - What? - This press conference. This shit is just not necessary, man. - God, yes it is. We need the press conference because we need to regain focus. We need to work it into our terms. Listen. Every successful activist revolutionary group. The IRA, the Panthers, the Satisas, the Earth Liberation Group, they're all alone. They all have a public face. A spokesperson. Are you hearing me? - Yeah. - OK. OK. So, we'll draft something. But you need to read it and make sure it's true to your vision, all right? (honking) (tense music) - OK. So, we set it up so the host bounces like I thought... - No, no, no, look, this is a simple if not then equation. If you and your pals don't figure out how to shut this fucking thing down, then you'll find yourself in lock down for the next three years, because we know what the fuck you've been doing. - Sir, sir, do you understand... - So, look, it's a simple fucking equation. - No, look, he's smart. He's set it up so the service provider bounces. It changes locations like every 20 minutes. And they're foreign hosts, so unless you take whole regions, like whole countries offline, I don't know how to do it. - Well, we view it as a continuum. This is not unrelated to hacker theft of Wall Street assets, cyber attacks on the Pentagon, defacement of government websites, but it's more malevolent and far more dangerous. This is a form of terrorism, there's no question about that, a new and very troubling breed of terrorism. - [Voiceover] Any indication where the website host is located? - [Olivia] You've seen this guy before, right? - Not really, no that one. - [Allan] Say on this time that we will apprehend... - I read that he's taking some leadership position at Homeland Security. We should go after him. Like a fucking coo, right? - That was Allan Keller, lead prosecutor from the attorney general's office, here in New York. - Seriously. You take it to the next level with him. It's going there. It's got to go there. - No, it doesn't have to do shit. - You think that no one's gonna get hurt? That violence doesn't enter the game plan at some point? - No. We make the decisions. And we don't have to follow any model, precedent, or whatever the hell else you want to call it, OK? Shit ain't predetermined. - Where are you going? (tense music) - Oh, God. - OK, OK, OK, Mom, stop, stop, you can't make a scene. OK? - I understand. - I'm fine, really. - You sure? - Yeah, really. - You know they're on to you. You know that, right, the FBI? - Yes, yes. - Came to the house, Terrell. They took all your stuff. They held me overnight. - I'm sorry. - It's just a question of time, that's the situation. Not if, Terrell, when. - What did you tell them? - I already lost your father, I'm not going to lose you, too, OK? - I got to get out of here. - No, no, you listen to me. - What? - After your father died, I swore I would do everything I could to give you what you needed to survive, the skills to get ahead in this life. - I don't have time to listen to this right now. - Terrell, and you have them, you have them and you are wasting them. What are you even doing? You've never been a political person. - What I'm doing is having impact. I'm exposing these assholes for who they really are. The media's all over this story now. - The media. Terrell, it's a freak show. An abduction, a batting, anything to fill the pages, the airwaves. - OK, what about the articles I sent you? Your boss, your boss resigned because of what I did. - He had two months before retirement. They gave him a full benefits package. Somebody even told me that he bought a big house down in Florida. His wife didn't even leave him. You can work out a deal. That's what the agents I talked to said. - I just came to see if you're OK, all right? You can take this. - No, no, no, I don't want that. I want to know that you're not gonna end up in jail or dead. Do you even hear a word I'm saying? Sweet boy. - I got to go. (crying) - I'm waiting on something, Senator. - I guess it's like I said before. - You didn't say anything before, you were evasive before. - Well, ultimately, if a constituency does not support foreign aid or peacekeeping efforts, then I, as a US senator, really don't have... - Yeah, assuming they're getting the facts. Is that what you're saying? Your constituency, is that what they're getting? - People want the facts bad enough, they can get 'em. In the United States of America, they can get 'em. Could we at least cover my privates? Could we do that at least? - [Terrell] Why don't we try answering the question first, Senator? - [Senator] Christ. Now, of course, if you got yourself killed, say, if you got martyred, well that would be the best. That's better than even going to jail because then some little elementary school in the ghetto somewhere will get named after you. (grunting) - Son of a bitch. - [Voiceover] Maybe I picked up a virus. The only way to really shake things up is to have the establishment come face to face with the barrel of a gun. Because technology's easy. It has rules. Discernible patterns. 'Cause once you get people impassioned is where shits starts to blur. - I mean, if they're starving in them other places, let 'em starve. If they hump monkeys in the jungles of Africa to get AIDs, then that's their cross to bear. Look, could we cover up my goddamn genitals? (chatter) - I'm going to read my statement now. Thank you. So here we go. The confess project is about giving a voice to truths that are rarely heard. It's about learning the behind the scenes reality from those who own the means of production, manipulate the flow of information, those who possess the power to indiscriminately alter the course of our lives. (beeping) - I worked for the UN for eight years and now I work for the World Trade Organization. - [Voiceover] Into the camera. - OK, OK, just please, OK. I work as a chief intermediary between governments and multinational firms. - [Voiceover] Tell me about the money. - WTO believes that democracy functions best, actually flourishes... - [Voiceover] What? - Flourishes in an open market environment and that capitalism... (gunshot) (sirens blaring) (intense music) - In keeping the radical social justice movements of the past, because it's high time to harness the frustration out there and put principle and theory into action. Thank you. - Miss Alvero. (beeping) (tense music) - What? - Hurry up, let me in. Hey. (beeping) Greg. - There was quite a turnout at your press conference. - You know who my father is, right? - OK. All right, I'll see. Olivia, I'm Miss Bradford, one of your father's attorneys, we met at the trust disbursement. He asked that I meet you here. (tense music) - Shit. (applause) (melancholy music) (tense music) OK. I'm... I'm talking now because shit's happening that has nothing to do with me. I'm being blamed for actions that I'm not even involved with. Here's the deal. If charges are dropped against me, if I'm granted immunity, then I will stop the abductions. So, what's in it for you? - Conditional immunity based upon my client's success in hacking other sites deemed a dangerous, indefinite assistance in targeting suspected activists, terrorists, et cetera, and some as yet unspecified public service type work. - A minimum of 1,000,000 for the film rights, plus a piece of the back end profits, that's minimum. That doesn't include tie-ins, music, merchandising. - In branding our clients, it's all about figuring out who they really are. Who you really are. - You have a very fortunate case in that you've done a lot of the branding already. - Exactly, I mean, all that's left for us to do is to help you shape your more mature persona. How's all of this sound, huh? Do you have any questions? - You got a pen? Thanks. (ethereal music) (chatter) - Go to your house without saying anything. Step back, come on, give him room, give him room, step back, everybody, step back. Step back, everybody, come on. (chatter) Step back. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Lessor will have a statement for you very shortly, in about five or 10 minutes, please bare with us. - So, we just worked out a deal. (chatter) (hip hop music) I've always been deeply concerned with social justice issues. It's just at a certain point, I realized that the potential for violence and harm was just too great. - In our ongoing reporting on Mr. Lessor, we recently unearthed exclusive home video footage of more innocent times, which we'd like to share with you now. - Terrell Lessor today signed on as spokesperson for proactive floating line campaign in a deal rumored to be in excess of $2,000,000. - We all feel frustrated, you know, sometimes, right? Powerless. - [Voiceover] This, in addition to the book and movie deal already negotiated... - Oh, yeah, man, definitely was trying to make a statement. I wanted to make people question, I wanted to make people think differently about things. - His managers indicate that one of his first expenditures was paying off his mother's mortgage and for a complete redesign of her home. - Well, now I'm just really just trying to keep it real. I'm trying to speak out against the people who took what I was doing the wrong way and took it to an extreme. (club music) - Hey, you're that guy, right? - No, probably not. - Yeah, you are, the confess project. I just wanted to say I really respected what you were doing, you totally had something important to say. - Yeah, thank you. - Oh, hey, wait. Can I get an autograph? I think I still have it, yeah, here. (hip hop music, sirens blaring) - I do not live the life of a happy fucking celebrity, OK? It was my choice. It was my choice. 10 years minimum with no computer, nothing? What I was trying to do, which was turn this into something else, something positive. You played me. - Investigators have yet to issue a statement as to what exactly happened several nights ago, outside this Brooklyn motel. Apparently, the locale where celebrity and counter culture icon Terrell Lessor was staying. At present, investigators are indicating Mr. Lessor may, himself, have been abducted, but are unwilling to disclose whether they have any leads. - I am not living the life of a happy fucking celebrity, OK? 10 years. It was just at a certain point, I realized the potential for violence and harm was too great. I was your classic latchkey kid. If you can flip, flip. You're the fucking man, the geek turned celebrity. (tense music) OK, so what do you want to know? Platform, yeah. I can, it was my choice. 10 years minimum with no computer? Nothing? What I was trying to do, was turn this into something else, something positive. Yeah, I've always been interested in - [Voiceover] If you got yourself killed, say, if you got yourself martyred... - I've talked, I've talked about... Consider truth. Happy fucking celebrity high life. - [Voiceover] This is a story right now. - I'm just trying to keep it real, keep it real. The only way to get to the truth is to, is to force the establishment to come face to face with the barrel of gun, the barrel of, the barrel of... (gunshot) (upbeat music)
