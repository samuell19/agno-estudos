My brother in America says the same thing. The problem lies in the country itself. Actually the government there is... sir sir sir Who is he, he doesn't look like someone who comes for a walk every day. Constable Muruganandam. First grade. - Yes, sir. He is now under suspension. Asking to get back to work and recommend me. yes sir How many times have you said the same thing? I have it memorized now. Come to this temple, don't bother me. sorry sir They make a mistake and pester us to recommend again. Come on, dad's coming. Chah, it's crazy. How many more times do you want to go and see? what happened Even today your assistant police did not talk about the letter of recommendation? Why are you asking about that? Just greeted like always today. Okay, hands off. It will happen in time. We are helpless, but hope is not lost. bye dad - Hey Rasu. Only for today. Will dad come to school? He does not come to the classroom. Your mother told you to call the maths teacher and come. I'll go to the staff room and check on the missus, and that's it. Dad, if you come inside the school, you should wear a police uniform. From the day I came to this school, my friends have been told that my father is in the police. Have you ever been in a police uniform? Your police uniform is at home. I should have brought it. That's wrong, son. When suspended, it is not good to use the uniform for anything. Then don't come inside the school. Then come one day when you are in uniform. - Hey, hey If you ask whether or not my mother spoke to Miss Ganang, what will I say? Tell Miss Ganang to leave today. Couldn't have waited and walked? Well now, Doc was told he could go home in two days. This nurse took good care of me. This is my husband. Working as DSP in Vellore. Sir, I have seen it before. Sir, my husband is also working in police. Do you remember sir? You even came to our wedding. - Oh, is that so? Tell me about your husband. Will you have to change clothes again? - It is not necessary, said Doc. Before leaving, talk to the doc and leave. Ranganadam sir. I have worked with it when I was a special force inspector in Tuticorin. A very good man. He admits that he did this as your moneylender, right? Accepted sir. - Come to the court... You won't change it, will you? No sir, I will come and tell you anywhere. my family Four deaths, sir. If they find out that I surrendered, our people will kill me. Don't be afraid. Sir, they have us surrounded. Sir, you said you will save me, didn't you? save me Do something sir. Don't leave me alone, they will cut me to pieces. Velu, take the accused to safety. How dare he go to the police! Run away. - Hey Das. You take him to court, I'll take care of the others. Sir, they were born in the jungles. When you are nearing retirement, do you want to die, sir? Now our duty is to protect him. Sir, my father died in a riot they did... I got this job. Sir, let's let him go. A god or a leader, sir, sacrifice our lives for him? Why the hell are you wearing khakis? A policeman is the one who fulfills the responsibility properly. No matter what. He should be handed over to the court. This is my order. ok sir Today I finish the face. They run away, go and catch them. Sir? - Well done. thank you sir - Let's take it to court. That got him promoted and transferred to Vellore. Listen to this. Will you listen if I say something? What is it? Are you going to ask him to go and talk about my suspension? No way. Are you asking people you don't even know? What happens if you ask him? How do you do that, Kavi? How do you ask for help from someone you haven't had a relationship with for 10 years? We have the need, that's why we have to speak. i can't I don't want to see him in uniform after so many years. Be patient. Everything will be fine with us. Will.. Will.. All things happen, except good things. Hey Kavi, what's going on now? That's all I care about. hey Hey Kavi, will you open the door? no? Do you talk to it? no? i can't What do you say now? i can't Hey Kavi. - Bari Ademai. I'll take care - go away. Trying to win after fighting. Did you read too much? I don't know what to do in the morning. Here's coffee. I'm sorry for talking like that last night. Something is going wrong. Our good man said so. You haven't been asked for anything yet, have you? Please talk to it for me. Now it is time to stand like a dog next to each other to secure the job. Kavi, try to understand a little bit. Understood, very understood. You don't want to hear. It seems like there is a fight even today. - That's okay. You don't have to come and ask, I'll go and ask. Hey Kavi. - I don't listen when told. in my case Nothing good is going to happen. Let's go, dad, before the fight gets too big. Yes, yes, come on, let's go quickly. Come and put on your shoes. Kavi, I will drop Rasu to school. Let's both go as soon as we come. Is that good? I will talk to Ranganadam sir. Really? hmm.. get off Listen... this is the room... what is that Medicines are applied to the eyes. I told you, Kavita's husband is here. Ah... Ah... hello sir what happened sir Were you caught taking revenge from someone who came to file a complaint? He does not do such things, sir. A very good person sir. If he says so... Otherwise, why are they banned from work? Write down what you came to say on a piece of paper and leave. I'll see what I can do. Why are you so quiet? Try talking to it. How can I talk to a higher official like that? They ask you for help and keep coming. Look at their face and talk. I am here with eye medicine. You've been there since breaking your leg. That's why he wrote it on a piece of paper and told him to leave. What else do you want to do? Ok sir, I will write it down. thank you come let's go Hello? just wait. Sir? hey son how are you Because this can't even be found, even with a beard. Savitri knows him, right? I have told you. In the riots in Muttopu... All of a sudden, a constable came and dragged the accused and handed him over to the court. Yeah yeah.. He is himself. Why Muruga, what happened? How did you get suspended? Six months ago.. Worked as a Constable in Nekankari Police Sir. Sir? Sir? What? I want to file a complaint, sir. What's the matter? My name is Pavitra sir. A boy is always bothering me that he loves me, sir. On the way home from work today... Hey stop. Did you see the bottle of acid, hit him in the face and go beyond recognition, right? Tomorrow is also coming, getting ready to say I love you. I am very scared sir, that's why I came to file a complaint. understand At this time, we only have the authority to deal with urgent complaints. Even if the complaint is received, action cannot be taken immediately without knowing who the person is. You come in the morning, okay? When you come to Kokat in the morning, bring your father and brother. My parents are very old sir. There are no brothers and sisters. Tell me the boy's name and address. I don't know sir. Do you remember the number of that boy's bike? Remember sir. Ask your son about this sir. Otherwise, we'll have to ask about it later. Hello? Warned the boy's house, he will not bother you after this. Don't be afraid that you have no one. Whatever the problem is, come to the police and file a complaint. A policeman will come as a brother or a brother for you. as me. Thank you very much bro. We are all here to hear about what happened to your daughter. What do the police say? Pavitra.. Pavitra.. Has something serious happened to Doc? - A large sore in the mouth. Cracked mouth with a beer bottle. Many pieces of glass were removed from the throat. Not only that, this is permanent. Corrupted. "Arrest the culprit" "Listen to us" Go back. Go back. Do not arrest my son illegally. He is innocent. what are you looking at Set it free, innocently. Our party members will take revenge for this. AC asks what they are still doing without catching the culprit. Sir, we have caught the suspect. He proudly says that he didn't do it. Do you know who my father is? I saw how he said it arrogantly. If he admits the mistake, he becomes the "guilty". Until then, he is a suspect. If you talk to the girl when she regains consciousness... you idiot. Before that girl regained consciousness and showed that it was him... The higher officials will not open their hands to us. There is no other option. He has to admit that I did it. the beast - Sir. The guy you beat, he needs to tell the truth. Sir, I don't know about this. I'm telling the truth, open my hand. Tell the truth, won't you? Did you? tell me the truth i didn't Did I admit I did it? - No sir. Didn't accept. He bows and accepts. Four days later, the girl regained consciousness. Because the girl can't talk. Using someone who knows sign language... Got a statement from that girl. Pavitra, what happened daughter? Tell me, daughter. the police.. the police.. no.. no.. say yes From the statement given by that girl.. He told some information about the person who raped him. A letter C.. Stomach? It is said that there was a C mark in the stomach. None of the information given by the girl matched the person we arrested. The cruelest thing about this sir... The girl died while giving the statement. Pavitra? I hit him... The one who threatened to throw acid on the girl. I thought he might have done this himself, sir. Because I hit him.. I filed a human rights complaint, sir. Till date, we have not been able to find the real culprit, sir. I was also suspended. Tell Ranga. One of our boys is working as a constable in Neelankari Police. Banned from work for one year due to human rights. Six months have passed. He should take up his duties again. You said it was my responsibility to get him back on duty. Thank you Kamal. the beast Your DIG is my close friend. Before a week passes, an order will come to take over the work. From the money taken from my brother, I will give you two crores. Marie open your arms. I was adopted, I am a dog that only cares for one person. They don't care like you. Hold the mouth and fry. Don't let Sura get caught, Marie. You kill me yourself, Marie. Marie.. Hey Allapalla Uva. Look where you are, brother. How do you climb that and escape? Are you kidding? Today your death is certain. I'm not dead if you catch me. I die myself. He goes to Sura and says that he died laughing happily. What the hell is he trying to do? Brother Sura will be angry if he dies. hey Greed for money went wrong. sorry brother For those who knowingly make mistakes.. No right to apologize. students For those who get fifty marks in this exam.. Only they will be allowed to go on the trip next week. Who wants to take fifty points and go on a fun trip? Raise your hands. Very well written in the exam. Those who get less marks should be beaten in class. That is their punishment. Those who get fifty marks in this exam. Only they will be allowed to go on the trip next week. Miss? Hello? afraid.. Too much fear is also a disease. How long has this been happening to your son? He's usually a little scared, doctor. I thought it would be okay to grow up. We didn't think it would be so bad. Treatment is fine, right, doctor? The treatment I give alone will not get better. There are some small things to do, try doing them at home. What is he afraid of? Make him understand that there is nothing to be afraid of. Another important thing.. Be very careful when this happens to your son. Take it when he is short of breath. Let him keep the medicine we give him. What does this mean? When we often think about the reason for our fear, that fear does not go away. That fear can be eliminated only by action. If a dog comes to bite you, you can only escape if you run away. Only by doing that you can be saved. Isn't this underworld leader Sura? Leader - What? Sura is coming. alcohol? Why does he come here? Are you coming for me or for my party? come.. come.. My savior, why so suddenly? how are your? here what's the matter I don't know why the leader asked to come suddenly. OK, I'll be outside. Only ten minutes are given. what's going on Not even considering that we are ex-ministers, all three of us have been fired... We are going to ask someone's daughter to be married to his son. It wasn't him. Threatened. Leader, he has kidnapped and killed many people from our party. You can ask for a seat from the party, but how can we give it to daughters? The seat is not his goal, winning is his goal. Married a daughter of one of you. You are winning consecutively, in your own seat... He wants to win over his son by pretending to be your son-in-law. That's what he wants to be. He is in control from the city market to the port, you know about that right? His daughter was previously married and now divorced. Because of that, let's give his daughter. What makes a new story? It's not a story, it's true. Daughter of his second wife. The children of the first wife are trying to kill that girl.. He said while he was drunk. So want to give my daughter? Give your daughter. - Veeramurthy. Think about it. If Sura becomes your family member, it will be an advantage for you. Your daughter is safe too. What is there to think about? You can give it. Ok leader I will give my daughter. I will meet you at home with the invitation. Sura? From now on your son is a politician. Look, it doesn't matter if there are blood stains near him. But there can be no black spots. Remove the case complaints related to him. Understood, Mr. Leader. i will take care A letter sir. Thank you ma'am. Give me the phone, father. - Where are you running? Going to play a game. "I LOVE YOU" father? What? Why sir Are you happy to be a policeman again? I have always been a policeman. You may be a policeman to the country, but to me you are a thug. What? Do you remember? "From now on your son is a politician" It doesn't matter if there are blood stains near him. But there can be no black spots. Brother? How many people my son has stabbed to death? But he never let a case fall. Unbeknownst to me, little things may have been done. I might even have been told not to. Our boys should go and surrender to the police for those cases. Then there will be no problem when the marriage takes place. Brother? Two years ago, the registered office in Awadi... He told me to put petrol in a tea container and bring it. Hey who locked it? Hey.. Hey.. What are you doing? Why are you trying to mess with me? who are you You do this without knowing me. Save.. Save.. Brother.. Brother.. Brother.. Brother is a family man. Sorry for not knowing.. Brother.. Hey Pakku? Brother? - Don't you drive your son's car? yes brother - Do you know something then? You know only one thing, brother. Add that too, lawyer. Everyone get money today. As the lawyer tells.. Go to the police on Monday and surrender. Right? ok brother who is that Can't see the eyes? The car backed up without a front gun, idiot. hey what did you say Stupid huh? - Open me. Hey, open your hand, savage. Mother.. Open your hand. Do you call the police? Say it with this. Run away now, idiot.. Not going to the police? What happened daughter? Dad.. Sir? Why Bhaskar? Sir, mu vella. Son of Sura. Sura is no ordinary thug. Even big cases come out easily. Please think about what I am saying Kamal. Because of that, can you just let it go, father? My father, being a big cop, thought he would be caught. Father says that he is a big thug and cannot be caught. I did not expect this from you. I leave. I don't want to stay here as freely as before, father. Baba will definitely arrest him. He does not need to be punished. Hit the ear.. Just ask the girls if they do this or not. That's enough. Say Muruga, the letter to resume work has arrived, right? He told me to come and take over work on Monday, sir. Good. Called to thank you sir. My friend Kamal himself did this. To you and DIG sir, I owe a lot sir. I will never forget this, sir. Call me anytime. Now I have come to a festival. Call later? - Okay, sir.. It's okay ok sir no problem.. thank you sir.. i love you Mom? father? Did you become a policeman again? Super dad. bye Our station is the same. Muruga took over the job quickly, didn't he? yes brother The station is not what it used to be. - Why is that, brother? Unsolved cases are increasing. Now whatever it is, the inspector will catch it and put it inside. Why are you standing, let's go inside. - Brother.. Called the inspector. He said to wait. Ok then I'll go and do some work. - You do. Sir, I have to attend a case. What to do about it? go hand in hand what is the case Sir, you have to take responsibility. Who should it meet? Go and find the radius. I surrender sir. Sit down and I'll talk. You say - the name is Guna.. Age thirty, father's name Shanmugam. A three wheeler driver. sir Muruga, even the DIG seems to be on hold. No sir, you know. When I get promoted next year, I will be a head constable. If you stay at home for a year, there will be some problem.. My husband came back to work soon with a recommendation.. It is not good to worry about having a recommendation. As soon as Mr. Muruga came.. Four long pending cases are going to end today. Just look back. The accused themselves come and surrender. It looks like we will have less work. Did the person who broke the chain accept the mistake? No, sir, if you do something, it will be fine. Muruga himself has come to see about them. hey beast - Mr. You don't accept the mistake made by breaking the chain, you go and smash four or five. Then the truth is real. Don't make the mistake of saying this, sir. They are thinking that they are not doing the work that is being locked. Give me any other work sir. I will do your homework sir. Because you were banned from work, right? Okay, go ahead and do the complaint writing. Keep an eye on the girl until marriage. Keep an eye on the dam. Ok bro, I'll take care. the beast On the first day he arrived, he told the inspector strictly that he would not do the work of locking and hitting, right? yes brother You can't stay at home with half of your salary. Why is the baton given to hit? It's okay to be reprimanded, brother. It is not good to hit to punish I am not going to do what other policemen have done. do you hear It's dangerous. If he gets suspended two or three more times, he will be able to go to a bigger place. wait and see sir - Bhaskar come. This is your last salute to me. Going to Australia tomorrow. Go to Australia and rest in peace with your daughter sir. He said that because he is retiring now. hey Is there a firebox? Here is the lighter. Well? Where did he go? When I thought that I would not be able to see Australia after settling down... Are you talking fast? Bhaskar, washed the well. Sir? You are my most trusted person, that's what it's all about. Take the baton and skin it. I have to look forward to it. Don't play sir, you're going to do this. They will kill me sir. You yourself know about alcohol, sir. I am very scared sir. I can't do this sir. Look at how you smile, sir. do you hear Do you hear me sir? I can hear you very well sir. Please don't do this. - I am with you. Hey Bhaskar. - I can't, sir. Don't catch me sir. Did Kamala leave for Australia? Sir? Tell me sir. Kamal needs a little help. I will sir, I will go now. Tell me where you want to go. hey untie me He is an accused who even the police cannot take into custody. Not saying who. But I will tell you what he did. For children, father is their hero. But for the child of a policeman father, the father is the superhero himself. My daughter thought the same about me. But in front of him, I'm not a hero. He is someone who has done nothing for someone who could not do anything. It was caught today. I hold this hand... That's what's calling you. Sir? Didn't quite understand sir. Skin the face. I should not even be able to stand up to the beating. Don't forget it until you die. how am i sir Call and come. Say Kavi. What time are you coming? I came to meet DIG Kamal sir. Taught to do important work. is it? ok then You got to go back to work because of him. Whatever work he gives, do it as he praises without thinking. ok Do you? ok i will Sir? I am not familiar with this baton, my baton is on the bike. Go get it? Will bring it soon. Brother? Which policeman touched my son? I don't know bro. The face is covered. He has kidnapped a big policeman. After talking to a small policeman working under him... He has beaten himself. What? Call every policeman we know. It doesn't matter how much it costs. I want the one who kidnapped my son. not. No, father. I want the one who hit me first. You have to kill him first. - Well? Let's lift one after the other. I will take care of it. Hey, someone should have removed this cover. My brother did not ask how much I said. After killing the one who hit him, he says, "Brother, who will be removed?" Let's find Vella and kill them both, now remove that cover. father? I saw the one who hit me. Look at this. See a hole in this? I could see your face through the mirror. I should not forget his meeting. I can only find it if I look through this hole. If I take this off and meet you, I will forget it. I will not remove this cover without finding it and killing it. Well? Did they talk by name? Think carefully. not. Bro, did you mention the name of a station called E4 or K5? Did you hear them talking? not. Ringtone? Ringtone? I remember well the ring tone of the one who hit me. Kai... hey... Run to every police station, don't leave a police car behind. It doesn't matter who has that ringtone. Same high fin. Brother? You go to the bunch. - Okay bro. You go to Vadapalani. - Okay bro. You go to Thirummyur. What does this mean? Have you ever been hit by a policeman? There is no way that will happen. He is definitely a policeman. Don't we know about baton strikes? Hey, don't even open your hand. - Okay bro. ok then I will search in my jurisdiction. I will find out who that policeman is and tell you. sir Have to go to the commissioner's office and get the vehicle ready. ok sir hey - Sir? Ask Murugan to come. ok sir Thangavel.. Sam.. Panneer Selvam.. frames.. Kaleivanan.. Kali Muttu.. Gerald.. I have a little doubt sir. Is there a separate person to beat every police station? Not like that. Every policeman gets angry. This cannot be done, there are police officers who say that this is dirty work. sir Look at him. It is said that even if you give a crore, you will not hit anyone. What do you mean by this? ok sir Whatever you find, call, don't open your hand. OK OK.. Muruga. - Mr. Go with this, something gives... bring it - OK sir. Hey, I'm taking this glass too. Hey, these bones... Want to ask to be removed? sorry sir I will send it. - Okay. "The news station, I don't know if it's mine, I think" Hey Kanagu? What are you doing here? It's like getting down to business. Yes bro, catch up soon. Muruganandam.. ok i will talk Hello? Hello? who is this do you hear Hello? Come on. Will he remain undetected anyway? Give me one too bro. ok brother - Sir? My phone is out of money. Need to make an urgent call, can you give me your phone number? I will take a call. Constable brother, he is one of our boys.. Take, don't run, give. Looking for. He is caught and hanged with a rope around his neck. Hey, what are you still doing? Here it is, brother. who Our boys? If our boys get caught, that's the end of the story. Who did not know... No answer sir. Brother? Brother? will come again. ok bro Balu, could not find this only from Muruganandam. The phone was on silent. Beautifully spoken and made to sound good. The guy is a little weird. Let's take a call from the one that comes close. ok brother Here it comes. He's not a policeman, he's a joker. yes brother Hello? who is this do you hear Why did the bell ring? Shouldn't you have knocked on the door? why is that? what happened My son is sleeping, don't you know that you hear the bell when you ring it? Listen to this.. Saw a video on Facebook. Look at this. - what? Look how this policeman beats a cow. People in your department behave very cruelly in such matters. It is even shown to the news. "A video is spreading on social media" A police officer While they don't know who the police officer is who covered the face of the criminal they caught That person was badly beaten by him.. Sura's son, who is an underworld leader, has been identified as Vellai Will it? The video of the super police officer who attacked a criminal like Vellai like this Millions of people have watched on the Internet Meanwhile, "Well, it's over... the super police officer" The hashtag "Respect Women" is trending Beat it to get rid of the skin, sir. Yes, isn't it? Look at how it plays. Well given. Sir, is that the same video? Yes, yes, that's the video. Thangavel, are you the same? Those people are surprised. Tell us these new things. - Mr. Constable.. This is Sura's son Vella. Can we catch them and beat them? That's what you're looking at. Is Sura an ordinary person? His son is said to have been tied up and beaten. Is there smoke without fire? That's the rice itself. Based on my experience. You can see the face in this video, if you really hit the sand... By now, his family is over. There are only five days left for the wedding. The family members have seen that video and are asking me questions after questions. My son is not in that video. I got to know that your son is in hospital. is that Slipped and fell while going to the toilet. - is it? That's it. Weeramurthy.. Just take care of your marriage. It is enough if only the marriage takes place. Don't make me do other things. They have started looking for a minister, because of that it is not appropriate to stay in this hospital. I can't see your face in this, right? Why are you looking at this? Hey..turn off this TV... Sorry bro, hit the zoom button. Hey wait... Caught father... That.. N.. Tha.. M.. Nantham His father is a policeman whose last name is Nandam. Kai.. - That's enough brother. I will find out who it is and come back. I will come Let's pick it up before evening. There are only 12 policemen whose name ends with Nandam. Brother? His name is Brahmanandam. Look at this one too. not. Take the car. Brother of this house. Look at Vella. hey stop Well, look at this policeman. Not mouth. His name is Jivanandam. Not mouth. not.. not. not.. Brother? What happened, did you find it? No brother yet, I will definitely catch it before evening. Talking to the lawyer now.. At the time of marriage, if you look carefully at the problem of the police car, there will be no problem. Keep an eye on the man, don't pick him up now My son doesn't listen, brother That's why Kai tells you, If Vellai tries to do something, bring him by force ok brother Brother, he is coming. Grab the story as soon as you get close and don't let go. ok brother Sir.. Sir.. Sir.. The car ran out of oil. Well, this is Constable Muruganandam. See this one too. Is there a place to get oil near you? Go straight and turn right and you will find a bridge. There is a petrol station there. He's the one.. Look carefully and tell. I remember like that... Who is it? He is very innocent. He is from our Gnanamuttu station. No doubt, I know him well. hey just wait. Brother? I said, it can't be. Wella.. Wella..? Can he hit you? You are upset. If he keeps the baton, turn his back They joke that he hit me. Our guys even checked out its ringtones. There is petrol.. I can't do much, we searched. Are you trying to create a problem by hitting innocent people who are close to your marriage? You go inside. Brother Sura spoke now. you climb Listen well.. It's not him... My brother said don't ask questions, catch it. Open your hand. Hey catch up. - Let go of me. Are you going to get into trouble? Brother Sura said no, didn't he? Open your hand. Say Kavi. Bro, that's the same ringtone. Don't be in a hurry. Listen when told. Listen when told. Hold it loudly.. - Listen when told. Let me kill him. calm down I will keep it. Hey, open your hand. What? They are talking in turns. Well, why worry? You don't even know that you are looking for it. I don't even know that I found it now. Look, if you do something to him..

You call the inspector first. How long has it taken to find out how many items have been lost? Find out how big a problem Muruga is in. Muruga brother? Why does he do these things? It's like lighting fireworks for Diwali. Mr. Constable, are you doing this right? I don't know if it's right But not wrong. What are these for, Mr. Constable? Why are you asking me? If people have a problem, the police will go. If there is a problem with the higher officials, the department itself goes. If you are a problem for the constables like me, who will go?

Hit me and let everyone see that video... They put a cover over my face and ran around, didn't they? You have to hit the same way. To everyone coming to my wedding tomorrow... I want to know how the person who beat me was beaten Pick it up... hey tell the truth Why did you hit me that day? I hit you because my superior told me to. lie.. Don't lie.. Don't lie.. do not lie. That day when you hit... You know I am Vella. Knowing that he is Sura's son, did you hit him? Tell me.. Tell me.. yes bro Knowing who you are... hit You didn't expect that, did you? Can you tell me why you were hit? After raping a girl... While he was struggling, his mouth was torn by a beer bottle... Throwing it like a lot of garbage... The one who made the mistake was out like a king. After catching that wild one day... Cover your face and fold your arms and legs It's for constables like us... Not orders from above. An offer... That's what hit you. How do you know I did it? My ban has been lifted. On the first day of work... the beast The corruption case that got you suspended... The person who did it has come to take responsibility. One of them surrendered to Pavitra's corruption case. In the statement given by Pavitra, there was a tattoo of a bag on the neck of the person who raped her... He said there was a C-shaped spot on his stomach. The tattoo of the person who surrendered is newly done. The spot on the stomach was small. Then the head constable of Gundi station, Munyandi sir, came to our station. hello sir - Hello Muruga, how are you? Okay, did someone come to your station today and take charge? Yes sir, five people came and surrendered. But one of them seems to be a fake one. Not just one but all five are liars. What are you saying sir? Seven people came to our station and surrendered. Seven people have been handed over to the Saidapettai station. All liars are beasts. There is a thug called Sura. His son Vella.. Today, his men have surrendered to the cases related to him. The cases will end here. All right, I'll go in and see the inspector. Only God can punish them like this. That cruel face without mercy... I wanted to see it once. So you came to the bar you always come to and waited for you. My heart told you to do something. But... You can't do anything, said my intuition. So... He went out with a stone in his heart. A king will be killed on the same day... God.. Killing slowly... While DIG Kamal Sir was speaking... I saw you in the bar and saw you again in the same clothes. Saw half of the tattoo. Looked at your stomach to clear the doubt. That's when I gripped the baton tightly... Bad dog.. hey.. The thief who makes a mistake and hides... If you have such a big problem. A policeman who punishes that mistake... How big do I have to be? Then... Did you hit knowingly?.. Did you hit me knowing it was me? Brother, there has been anger in every blow he has hit. Do you understand now? Father, I have been avenged. Now caught. Let's kill. What? Take the weapon. hey Hey, a gun. Brother? We did not find it. He brought us all here.
