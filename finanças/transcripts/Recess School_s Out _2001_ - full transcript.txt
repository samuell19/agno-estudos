( Scientist ) LEVELS ARE GOOD. - READY ? - I'VE BEEN READY FOR DECADES. - JUST DO IT. - YES, SIR. INITIATE PHOTON CHANNELING. PHOTON CHANNELING INITIATED. SET MAGNIFICATION COORDINATES .073. COORDINATES SET. ENGAGE TRACTOR BEAM NOW. ( Continues Grunting ) ( Loud Zapping ) WHAT ARE THOSE KIDS UP TO IN THERE ? ( All Gasp ) A LITTLE MORE. A LITTLE MORE. HE'S SHOOTING AT THE MOON. I TOLD YOU THEY WEREN'T ALIENS. ( Beam Sputtering ) ( Turbine Winding Down ) DR. ROSENTHAL, WHY DID THE BEAM SUDDENLY-- OH, WHAT'S THE TECHNICAL WORD FOR IT ? STOP ? W-WELL, UH, AS I BELIEVE YOU WERE TOLD BEFORE-- "TOLD BEFORE" ? ( Chuckles ) DO YOU THINK I CARE WHAT I WAS TOLD BEFORE ? I'LL DO BETTER NEXT TIME. "NEXT TIME." ISN'T THAT CUTE. ROSENTHAL, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. SAY YOU WERE A TEACHER-- OR EVEN BETTER, SAY, THE PRINCIPAL OF A SCHOOL-- AND YOU HAD TO DEAL WITH A NAUGHTY CHILD WHO DIDN'T KNOW HIS PLACE, WHO KEPT TELLING YOU OVER AND OVER THAT HE'D DO BETTER "NEXT TIME." BUT HE NEVER DID. WHAT WOULD YOU DO ? OH, NO. N-NOT DETENTION. NOT DETENTION ! - TAKE HIM AWAY ! - NO, PLEASE ! I CAN FIX IT ! DON'T DO THIS TO ME-E-E ! ALL RIGHT, WHO'S SECOND-IN-COMMAND ? - UH, I AM, SIR. - WELL, GOOD. NOW YOU'RE IN CHARGE. AND IF I WERE YOU, I'D MAKE SURE I HAD THIS MACHINE WORKING AT FULL POWER BY TOMORROW MORNING.

HOLD IT IN ! - I CAN'T ! ( Loud Burp, Echoing ) WHAT WAS THAT ? SOMEONE HAD BETTER SAY "EXCUSE ME." ( All ) WHOA ! FENWICK, WHO LET CHILDREN INTO THE SCHOOL ? U-UH, N-NOT ME, SIR. - WELL, GET THEM ! - RUN ! ( Men Shouting ) THERE THEY ARE ! - ( All Gasp ) - HUH ? GET OFF OUR PLANET, ALIEN SCUM ! ( Groans ) OVER THERE ! GET 'EM ! GET 'EM ! COME BACK HERE !

HURRY UP ! - NOW YOU ! - BUT, TEEJ-- - GO ! - HAAAH ! - ( Gasps ) SAVE YOURSELVES ! T.J. ! T.J. ! IT WON'T BUDGE ! ( Shouting Continues ) ( Grunts ) WHAT THE J.P. MORGAN IS GOING ON AROUND HERE ? LET ME GO. LET ME GO ! I'M WARNING YOU ! I'M A BLACK BELT IN ORIGAMI ! WELL, WELL, WELL, IF IT AIN'T THE LITTLE SNOOP. - WHAT ? I AIN'T NO SNOOP. - ( Tape Rewinding ) ( T.J. On Tape ) 9:32 A.M. UGLY BALD GUY STILL GUARDING SCHOOL. HEH-HEH. OOPS. LET'S GO, SNOOP. YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE NOW. OW ! OW ! WATCH THE JACKET ! IT'S COTTON ! ( Muffled Shouting ) PRINCIPAL PRICKLY ! YOU'RE ALIVE ! OWW ! WOULD YOU BE CAREFUL ! BOY, AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU. YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT THESE GUYS ARE DOING. THEY'VE GOT THIS BIG LASER GUN AND-- - WHOA, WHO TOOK YOUR PANTS ? - NEVER MIND, DETWEILER. JUST UNTIE ME. - THESE KNOTS ARE TIGHT. - OF COURSE. I'VE BEEN PULLING AT THEM FOR THE LAST DAY AND A HALF. THEY'VE CHAFFED MY WRIST. - DON'T WORRY, SIR. MY PALS'LL GET US OUT OF HERE. - WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE ? YOU DON'T KNOW MY FRIENDS. THEY'LL GET HELP. YOU'LL SEE. SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU JUST ESCAPED FROM A TROOP OF NINJA WARRIORS ? - THAT'S RIGHT ! - AND THEY GOT A GIANT LASER GUN IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM ? - PRECISELY ! - WHICH IS AIMED AT THE MOON ? THANK HEAVENS YOU UNDERSTAND ! ( Grunts ) I'VE ALMOST GOT IT. CAREFUL, DETWEILER. THAT'S MY PUTTING HAND. ( Door Lock Unlocking ) HELLO, PETE. REMEMBER ME ? WELL, WELL, IF IT ISN'T PHILLIUM BENEDICT. I SHOULD'VE KNOWN YOU'D BE THE ONE BEHIND THIS. YOU KNOW THIS GUY ? AH, PETE AND I ARE OLD PALS. ALTHOUGH THE LAST TIME WE SAW EACH OTHER, PETE WAS THE ONE RUINING MYLIFE. BY THE WAY, PETE, YOU LIKE THIS SUIT ? IT'S ITALIAN. RAW SILK. NICE, HUH ? YOU ALWAYS WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT APPEARANCES THAN PEOPLE, PHIL. OH, PETE, COME ON. THERE'S NO NEED TO BE RUDE. NOT AFTER I INSTRUCTED MY MEN TO TAKE SUCH SPECIAL CARE OF YOU. SPECIAL CARE ? THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL GAGGING ME, TYING ME UP AND TAKING AWAY MY PANTS ? HAD TO. OTHERWISE, YOU MIGHT RUN OFF AND BETRAY ME, LIKE YOU DID THE LAST TIME. BUT, HEY, LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE. AT LEAST YOU'VE GOT COMPANY NOW. LET THE BOY GO. HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO YOU. ( Sighs ) SAME OLD NOBLE PETE. - ALWAYS STANDING UP FOR THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN. - YOU ? BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T LET ANYBODY GO RIGHT NOW. YOU SEE, THIS EXPERIMENTAL, UM, NIGHT SCHOOL THAT I'M RUNNING IS KIND OF A SECRET. I'M TRYING TO SHOW THAT MY... ( Chuckles ) ADULT STUDENTS CAN BE TRAINED... TO BE CAPABLE AND PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. WELL, IF YOU'RE JUST RUNNING A NIGHT SCHOOL, THEN WHAT'S THAT GIANT LASER GUN DOING IN THE AUDITORIUM ? WHAT A RUDE AND BADLY DRESSED LITTLE BOY YOU ARE. YOU SHOULD TEACH YOUR PUPILS A LITTLE RESPECT FOR THEIR SUPERIORS, PETE. BUT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT YOU'D HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO TEACH THEM ANYTHING AT ALL, WOULDN'T IT ? GEEZ, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT JERK ? WE WENT THROUGH TEACHER TRAINING TOGETHER. - YOU MEAN-- - THAT'S RIGHT, DETWEILER. THAT MAN IS A ROGUE TEACHER. ( Prickly ) IT WAS BACK IN THE SPRING OF '68. A DIFFERENT AGE. WE WERE ALL YOUNG, IDEALISTIC AND READY TO CHANGE THE WORLD. ( Chattering ) ( Rock ) OH ! HA HA HA. PEACE, PETER. HEY, MURIEL, HAD A GROOVY TIME AT THE DEAD CONCERT LAST NIGHT. YOU GONNA BE AT THE TEACH-IN SATURDAY ? WE'RE GONNA PAINT MY VOLKSWAGEN. - WOULDN'T MISS IT FOR THE WORLD. - GROOVY. YES, WE ALL THOUGHT WE WERE PRETTY COOL. BUT ONE GUY WAS THE COOLEST OF US ALL. ( Vehicle Approaching ) PHILLIUM BENEDICT WAS MY BEST FRIEND. HE WAS SMART, HE WAS HANDSOME. HE HAD JUST BEEN NAMED PRINCIPAL OF 3rd STREET SCHOOL. ( All Giggling ) SO, PHILLIUM, HOW'S IT FEEL BEING THE YOUNGEST PRINCIPAL IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE ? COPACETIC, BABY. I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY: YOUNG IS IN, MAN, AND OLD IS OUT. WAY OUT. DO YOU LIKE THE AMERICAN FLAG HELMET, PETE ? IT DOES GO WITH THE LEATHER JACKET, RIGHT ? YOU ARE ONE GROOVY EDUCATOR, PHIL. COOL. FOLLOW ME, MY MAN. I WANNA SHOW YOU MY NEW PRINCIPAL'S PAD. WHOA ! PSYCHEDELIC PRINCIPALIA. PULL UP A BAG, BRO. I WANNA RAP. LAY IT ON ME, MAN. YOU SEE, PETE, I BEEN THINKIN'. WE'RE A NEW GENERATION OF TEACHERS, RIGHT ? IT'S TIME WE SHOOK THINGS UP A LITTLE. I HEAR YOU, BROTHER. IN FACT, DIG THIS. I WAS MEDITATING TO THAT NEW RAVI SHANKAR ALBUM LAST NIGHT... WHEN I GOT THIS RIGHTEOUS NOTION-- WHAT IF WE HOLD ALL OUR CLASSES OUTSIDE, ON THE PLAYGROUND ? IMAGINE-- SCHOOL, RECESS. NO BOUNDARIES. HEY, BABY, THAT'S A HIP IDEA, BUT I GOT A BETTER THOUGHT HERE. AS MY FIRST OFFICIAL ACT AS PRINCIPAL, I'VE DECIDED... TO GET RID OF RECESS. WHAT ? NO RECESS ? BUT, PHIL, FOR A KID, RECESS IS LIKE A MAJOR PLAY-IN. IT'S THE ONE TIME OF DAY THEY HAVE ANY FREEDOM. ( Sighs ) LOOK, PETE, THE '60s ARE OVER. ALL THAT PEACE AND LOVE AND FREEDOM STUFF, IT WAS GREAT FOR PICKIN' UP CHICKS, BUT IT'S NOT GONNA HELP MY CAREER. TO DO THAT, I GOTTA MAKE TEST SCORES GO UP, AND TO MAKE TEST SCORES GO UP, I GOTTA KEEP KIDS IN CLASS WHERE THEY BELONG. THAT'S WHY, STARTING TOMORROW, I AM TUNING OUT RECESS... ONCE AND FOR ALL. ( Prickly ) NEEDLESS TO SAY, PHILLIUM'S PLAN DIDN'T GO OVER ALL THAT WELL. ( Shouting ) ( Protester ) WHAT DO WE WANT ? ( Crowd ) RECESS ! WHEN DO WE WANT IT ? NOW ! WHAT DO WE WANT ? WHEN DO WE WANT IT ? RECESS ! NOW ! BE COOL, PEOPLE, BE COOL. YOU'RE BUMMING MY MELLOWNESS. WE'LL BE COOL WHEN YOU GIVE OUR KIDS THEIR RECESS BACK. HEY, BABY, I'LL DO WHAT I WANT. I'M PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL, AND THERE'S NOTHING ANYONE CAN DO ABOUT IT. DIG ? ( Shouting Continues ) ( Man ) IT'S NOT RIGHT ! PEOPLE, PEOPLE, PLEASE CALM DOWN. ( Shouting Stops ) MR. PRICKLY HERE HAS INFORMED ME OF THIS "NO RECESS" PROPOSAL. LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT AS LONG AS I'M SUPERINTENDENT, THIS RADICAL PLAN WILL NEVER BE CARRIED OUT IN THIS DISTRICT. - ( Cheering ) - HEY, MAN, YOU JUST DON'T GET IT ! OF COURSE I DO, BENEDICT. THAT'S WHY I'M REPLACING YOU. WHAT ? - PRICKLY, FROM NOW ON, YOU WILL BE PRINCIPAL. - WHO, ME ? OH, I SEE WHAT'S GOING DOWN HERE. YOU TRICKED ME, WENT AROUND MY BACK TO THE MAN TO GET MY JOB ! - NO, PHIL, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL. - YEAH, RIGHT ! COME ON, MURIEL BABY, LET'S BLOW THIS SCENE. NO, PHIL, IT'S OVER. I COULD NEVER BE WITH A MAN WHO DOESN'T LOVE RECESS. SO YOU'RE AGAINST ME TOO. WELL, FINE. I DON'T NEED YOU. I DON'T NEED ANYONE ! AAAH ! PHIL ! YOU OKAY, MAN ? DON'T TOUCH ME ! YOU TOOK MY CHICK. YOU TOOK MY JOB. WELL, ENJOY IT WHILE YOU CAN, PETEY BOY, 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA PAY. SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY, YOU'RE GONNA PAY. I NEVER SAW PHILLIUM AGAIN. HE QUIT TEACHING, WENT INTO POLITICS, EVENTUALLY BECAME SECRETARY OF EDUCATION-- UNTIL THE PRESIDENT FIRED HIM FOR TRYING TO GET RID OF RECESS AGAIN. ONLY THIS TIME IT WAS NATIONWIDE. SO THAT GUY'S SOME WEIRDO EX-TEACHER WHO WANTS TO GET RID OF RECESS ? - MM-HMM. - OKAY. NOW IT'S PERSONAL. LET'S SEE-- WEATHER MAPS, SOME STUFF IN NORWEGIAN, A FARMER'S ALMANAC. MUST BE SOMETHING IN HERE THAT'LL EXPLAIN WHAT THAT DR. BENEDICT IS DOING. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING HE'S NOT DOING-- HAVING LUNCH TOMORROW AT 12:22 WITH HIS LITTLE GIRLFRIEND. SPINELLI, THAT'S THE MAN'S PERSONAL DATE BOOK. WELL, IT'S MINE NOW, AND I GUESS MISS LUNA PERGUM IS GONNA BE AT THE RESTAURANT ALL BY HERSELF. WHO DID YOU SAY ? THE GIRL WHOSE NAME IS IN HERE-- LUNA PERGUM. MUST BE SOME ITALIAN CHICK. LUNAE PERIGEUM. OF COURSE ! - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? - DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ? LUNAE PERIGEUMIS NO LADY. IT'S AN EVENT. LOOK. ONCE A MONTH, THE MOON REACHES THE POINT WHERE IT'S CLOSEST TO THE EARTH-- LUNAR PERIGEE, WHICH IN THIS CASE HAPPENS TO BE 12:22 TOMORROW AFTERNOON. MAYBE THAT'S WHEN THAT DOCTOR GUY IS GONNA SHOOT HIS LASER AT THE MOON AND BLOW IT UP. CLOSE GUESS, BUT I HAVE ANOTHER THEORY. WHEN I WAS UP AT SPACE CAMP, I OBSERVED SOME ABNORMALITIES IN THE MOON'S POSITION. I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS CAUSING IT, BUT NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE. DR. BENEDICT'S DEVICE IS NOT A LASER BEAM AT ALL. IT'S A TRACTOR BEAM ! YOU MEAN HE'S GONNA PLOW THE MOON'S SURFACE ? WHATEVER WILL HE PLANT ? NOT A TRACTOR, YOU GOOMBAH. A TRACTOR BEAM. LIKE FROM A SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE. PRECISELY. THEORETICALLY, IF A POWERFUL TRACTOR BEAM... WERE SHOT AT THE MOON EXACTLY AT LUNAR PERIGEE, IT COULD MOVE THE MOON INTO ANOTHER ORBIT. MOVE THE MOON ? BUT WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO DO THAT ? WHO KNOWS, VINCE ? WHO KNOWS ? ( Banging On Metal ) HERE WE ARE, SIR. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE BEEN CREEPING AROUND IN THESE VENTS. THEY'RE SCHOOL PROPERTY. DANG ! THE LINE'S DEAD. HEY, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE WALKIE-TALKIE YOU CONFISCATED FROM ME LAST WEEK ? TOP DRAWER, ON THE RIGHT. JUST LOOK WHAT PHIL'S DONE TO MY OFFICE. I HAD IT ALL NICE AND CLEAN FOR THE SUMMER. PACKS OF GUM, YO-YOS, MY OLD BASEBALL-- HEY, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS. HERE IT IS-- MY WALKIE-TALKIE. NOW ALL I GOTTA DO IS CONTACT THE GUYS AND-- OH, NO. WHAT IS IT, DETWEILER ? I TOLD 'EM THAT GUY WAS A NUT. ( T.J. ) HELLO ! HELLO ! IS ANYBODY THERE ? IT'S T.J. ! T.J., BUDDY, YOU'RE OKAY ? YEAH, I'M FINE, AND SO IS PRINCIPAL PRICKLY. PRINCIPAL PRICKLY ? I DON'T HAVE TIME TO EXPLAIN, BUT I THINK WE'VE FIGURED OUT WHAT BENEDICT IS UP TO. HE'S TRYING TO GET RID OF SUMMER VACATION ! NO ! GUYS, DON'T FREAK OUT ON ME ! I GOT A PLAN ! ALL WE DO IS-- HEH-HEH. WHY, MR. BALD GUY, WHAT A SURPRISE. T.J. ! T.J. ! IT'S DEAD ! THEY MUST'VE GOT HIM ! WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ? THERE'S ONLY ONE THING WE CAN DO: WE GOTTA GET HELP. ( Becky ) BOW-WOW ! WELCOME TO FLOPPY BURGER. MAY I TAKE YOUR ORDER, PLEASE ? BECKY, THIS IS VINCE. ( Becky ) WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ? IT'S NOT JUST VINCE, IT'S ME, GRETCHEN, EVERYBODY. WE GOT A PROBLEM ! I GOT A PROBLEM TOO-- SIX DWEEBY TEN-YEAR-OLDS WHO WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE, EVEN WHEN I'M AT WORK. I AM A PROFESSIONAL ! SO WHATEVER YOUR LITTLE PROBLEM IS, FORGET IT ! BUT IT'S ABOUT T.J. HE'S IN TROUBLE, AND HE NEEDS YOUR HELP. ( Becky ) WELL, ISN'T THAT NICE ? AFTER STEALING MY DIARY, THREATENING TO PUT IT ON THE INTERNET... AND MAKING ME DRIVE ACROSS THE STATE THREE TIMES, HE NEEDS MY HELP ? GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON WHY I SHOULD HELP HIM. 'CAUSE HE'S YOUR LITTLE BROTHER, AND HE NEEDS YOU. PLEASE PULL FORWARD TO THE SECOND DRIVE-THRU WINDOW. A CONFISCATED WALKIE-TALKIE. WHY DO YOU DO THESE THINGS ? DO YOU ENJOY TORMENTING ME ? DO YOU HATE ME ? I DON'T HATE YOU, PHIL. I JUST THINK YOU'RE INSANE. ( Chuckles ) INSANE. WELL, THERE YOU GO AGAIN, PETE. INSULTING ME, HURTING MY FEELINGS, JUST LIKE 30 YEARS AGO. ONLY THIS TIME, PETEY, I'M READY. YOU SEE, ALL THOSE YEARS, NO MATTER HOW BIG I GOT, NO MATTER HOW SUCCESSFUL, I ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT YOU. HOW YOU EMBARRASSED ME ! HOW YOU HUMILIATED ME ! HOW YOU DESTROYED MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MURIEL FINSTER, THE ONLY WOMAN I EVER LOVED ! THAT PART STILL GROSSES ME OUT, SIR. SHH. THIS TIME, PETE, I'M GONNA HUMILIATE YOU. I'M GONNA PROVE TO THE WORLD THAT YOU WERE WRONG AND I WAS RIGHT. - ABOUT WHAT ? - ABOUT RECESS ! ABOUT FREEDOM ! ABOUT TEST SCORES ! I'VE FOUND A WAY TO PROVE MY THEORY. I'M GONNA GET RID OF THE BIGGEST RECESS OF THEM ALL. I AM GONNA GET RID OF SUMMER VACATION. - YOU FIEND ! - "FIEND." TRY TO HELP PEOPLE, THAT'S THE THANKS YOU GET. - IT'LL NEVER WORK, PHIL. - WELL, ACTUALLY, PETE, THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG. YOU SEE, ALL I HAVE TO DO IS MODIFY THE MOON'S ORBIT EVER SO SLIGHTLY, AND TIDE LEVELS ON THE EASTERN SEABOARD RISE EIGHT FEET. MOVE THE MOON OVER HERE, AND THE CURRENTS THAT WARM CALIFORNIA SUDDENLY BECOME ICE-COLD. SUMMER, AS WE KNOW IT, WILL BECOME A THING OF THE PAST. AND WITHOUT SUMMER, - ( Both Gasp ) - NO SUMMER VACATION. - YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THIS, BENEDICT. - OH, YEAH ? WELL, WHO'S GONNA STOP ME ? WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE MY LITTLE BROTHER... ACTUALLY STUMBLED ON A REAL, LIVE EVIL CONSPIRACY. - THAT'S OUR THEODORE. - YOU SHOULD SEE THE CRATES OF SODA THEY LEFT BACK THERE. AND BOXES OF MUSTARD AND KETCHUP TOO. MMM, TOMATO-EY. HEY, THAT'S STUFF'S THE PROPERTY OF FLOPPY BURGER INTERNATIONAL. QUIT YOUR GABBIN' AND STEP ON IT. WE NEED REINFORCEMENTS. ( Cheering, Shouting ) ( Cheering, Shouting ) ( Finster ) I'M TELLING YOU, A TROOP OF NINJA WARRIORS... IS USING 3rd STREET SCHOOL AS A SECRET JUJITSU TRAINING GROUND. NINJA WARRIORS. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. ( Snickering ) JUJITSU TRAINING GROUND ? HEY, LADY, AREN'T YOU FORGETTING THE MAGIC LASER BEAM ? - I'M SERIOUS ! - SO ARE WE. HEY, I GOT AN IDEA-- WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME, GET SOME REST... AND WE'LL MAKE A PERSONAL CALL TO JACKIE CHAN. YEAH, HE'S THE PERFECT MAN FOR A JOB LIKE THIS. I'M TELLING YA, SOMETHING IS GOING ON IN THAT SCHOOL ! HELP ! HELP ! SOMEBODY GET US OUTTA HERE ! CALM DOWN, DETWEILER. CALM DOWN ? WE'RE LOCKED IN A GIANT BIRDCAGE WHILE A MADMAN'S TRYING TO DESTROY SUMMER VACATION, AND YOU WANT ME TO CALM DOWN ? - I UNDERSTAND, BUT I-- - HOW CAN YOU UNDERSTAND ? YOU'RE JUST A GROWNUP. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT SUMMER VACATION ? I'LL LET YOU IN ON A LITTLE SECRET, DETWEILER. EVERY ADULT YOU'VE EVER KNOWN WAS A KID SOME TIME IN HIS LIFE. YOU THINK WE DON'T REMEMBER SUMMER VACATION ? RIDING BIKES BY THE CREEK ? CATCHING POLLIWOGS IN A JAR ? CAMPING OUT UNDER THE STARS ? WELL, YOU'RE WRONG. SOME DAYS I SIT IN MY OFFICE, LOOKING OUT AT YOU KIDS ON THE PLAYGROUND, AND I THINK, "THEY DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD THEY'VE GOT IT. "IN A FEW YEARS, THEY'RE ALL GOING TO BE GROWNUPS, LIKE ME, AND ALL THOSE GOOD TIMES WILL JUST BE MEMORIES FOR THEM TOO." SO GO AHEAD, PUT A WHOOPEE CUSHION IN MY CHAIR, COVER MY CARPET WITH FAKE VOMIT, MAKE FUN OF MY BIG, SAGGY BUTT. BUT DON'T YOU EVER SAY I DON'T CARE ABOUT SUMMER VACATION, 'CAUSE THOSE MEMORIES ARE THE LAST PART OF CHILDHOOD I'VE GOT LEFT. PRINCIPAL PRICKLY, I HAD NO IDEA. YEAH, WELL, NOW YOU DO. - SO LET'S STOP MESSING AROUND. - HOW DID YOU GET THOSE KEYS ? SWIPED 'EM OFF PHILLIUM'S DESK WHEN HE WASN'T LOOKING. NOW COME ON. WE'VE GOT A SUMMER VACATION TO SAVE. ( All Chattering ) PEOPLE ! PEOPLE ! JUST QUIET DOWN FOR A MOMENT ! OH, MAN, NOBODY'S LISTENING. THEY'LL LISTEN TO ME, ONCE I INTRODUCE THEM TO MY GOOD FRIEND MADAM FIST. COME ON, SPINELLI. THAT'S YOUR ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING. I DON'T SEE YOU COMING UP WITH ANY GREAT IDEAS, SPORTS BOY. LISTEN TO THE TWO OF YOU. YOU'RE NOT HELPING AT ALL. ( All Arguing ) ( Gus ) QUIET ! WHAT WE NEED IS A LEADER. A KID WITH THE RIGHT TRAINING. A KID WHO KNOWS STRATEGY AND FIELD TACTICS. A KID WHO COMMANDS RESPECT. YEAH, BUT WHERE WE GONNA FIND A KID LIKE THAT ? LEAVE THAT TO ME. ( Chattering Continues ) ( Gretchen Whistles ) PLEASE ! WE HAVE TO GET ORGANIZED. AH, WHAT'S THE USE ? IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE, ALL THE FUN OF BEING A KID IS, LIKE, TOTALLY RUINED ANYWAY. - IT'S LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD'S BEEN TURNED RIGHT SIDE UP. - ( All Agreeing ) NOT NECESSARILY. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS WORK TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH A PLAN. DETWEILER'S THE ONE WHO ALWAYS COMES UP WITH THE PLANS. LET'S FACE IT-- WE'RE DOOMED. ( All Agreeing ) ( Spinelli ) THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK ! KIDS OF THE PLAYGROUND, MEET YOUR NEW COMMANDING OFFICER. GRISWALD ? HE COULDN'T LEAD A GLEE CLUB. YOU FIND THAT FUNNY, BRADLEY ? WELL, I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE JOKES ! I'M HERE TO MAKE HISTORY ! SO IF YOU WANNA LAUGH, TAKE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. BUT IF YOU WANNA SAVE THE WORLD, THEN SUCK IN YOUR GUT AND STAND AT ATTENTION. NOW WHO'S WITH ME ? ( Kazoos Playing "River Kwai March" ) ( Screams ) SODA BOMB ! SODA BOMB ! ( Gus ) VINCE, YOU AND THE ASHLEYS WILL BE IN CHARGE OF UNIT "A." I'LL TAKE UNIT "B." SPINELLI, YOU GET THE SPECIAL FORCES. - SPECIAL FORCES ? - THE KINDERGARTNERS. I OWE YOU FOR THIS, GRISWALD. NOW THERE'S ONE LAST THING I NEED TO SAY. - ( Talking Ceases ) - THIS MISSION IS BIGGER THAN ANY ONE OF US KIDS. BIGGER THAN T.J. EVEN BIGGER THAN PRINCIPAL PRICKLY. THIS, MY FRIENDS, IS ABOUT THE FUTURE. GEEZ, HE SOUNDS LIKE T.J. SHH. HE'S ON A ROLL. YEARS FROM NOW WHEN KIDS WHO AREN'T EVEN BORN YET LOOK BACK ON THIS MOMENT, THEY'LL SAY, "THEY DID IT. "THOSE KIDS SAVED 3rd STREET SCHOOL. THEY SAVED SUMMER VACATION." SO, BOYS AND GIRLS, WE'RE GOIN' IN. TWENTY-TWO MINUTES TO PERIGEE, SIR. VERY GOOD, FENWICK. ( Men Chattering Indistinctly ) - HELLO, BOYS. - HEY ! ( Men Groaning ) ( Punches Landing ) WHERE NOW ? THE AUDITORIUM. CHECK. ( Inhales ) NESSUN DORMA ( All ) HUH ? NESSUN DORMA ( Man ) IS THAT A KID ? - MA IL MIO MISTERO E CHIUSO IN ME - HEY, KID, GET OUT OF HERE ! AAH. ANDERSON, GET RID OF THAT KID, WILL YA ? IL NOME MIO NESSUN SAPRA ( Anderson Screaming ) NO, NO SMITHSON, UNDERHILL. SIR. SULLA TUA BOCA ( Men Screaming ) LO DIRO QUANDO LA LUCE HANKLIN, MORRISSEY, GOODMAN, GET OVER HERE ! YES, SIR. RIGHT AWAY, SIR. ON THE DOUBLE. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. YOU SURE THIS IS GONNA WORK, DETWEILER ? COME ON, PRINCIPAL PRICKLY. DON'T YOU EVER WATCH OLD SPY MOVIES ? THIS TRICK IS PURE GOLD. UH, DR. BENEDICT WANTED TO SPEAK TO US ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER. HEY, YOU TWO AREN'T GUARDS. RUN ! I'M CALLED LITTLE BUTTERCUP ANDERSON, MORRISSEY, UNDERHILL ? WHERE IS EVERYBODY ? AAH, IF YOU WANT SOMETHING DONE RIGHT, YOU GOTTA DO IT YOURSELF. - POOR LITTLE BUTTERCUP - ( Screams ) - SWEET LITTLE BUTTERCUP, I - ( All Shouting ) BOY, THESE SPACE-AGE POWER SHOVELS SURE DO A GREAT JOB. QUICK, IN HERE. THIS WAY ! THEY'RE INSIDE. WE LOST 'EM. NOW WHAT ? AMMO. ( Both ) TENDER. COMMENCE PHASE TWO. READY ? - HEY, GUARDS ! - HUH ? ( Grunting ) YOU LITTLE BRATS ! NOW ! INTRUDERS ! ( Shouting ) ( All Screaming ) SCANDALOUS ! ( Shouting Indistinctly ) - NOW ! - HUH ? BOMBARD, MEN ! GET 'EM. ( All Shouting ) ( Screaming ) "LUNCH ROOM, FRONT OFFICE--" HERE IT IS, "AUDITORIUM." ( Loud Hum Resonating ) UH, FENWICK, WHY IS THE POWER OFF ? UH, PERHAPS WE BLEW A FUSE, SIR ? WELL, GO FIX IT ! WE MUST RESTORE THE POWER. QUICKLY, HERE. HEY, WHAT HAPPENED ? LET US OUT ! PLAN'S WORKING, GUS. GOOD. NOW WE GOTTA STOP THAT LASER BEAM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK, KID. YOU BRATS ARE DONE FOR. ( T.J. ) HEY, BALDY ! SAY YOUR PRAYERS. IT'S CHOWDER TIME. ( Screaming ) - BULL'S-EYE ! - T.J. ! I KNEW YOU GUYS WOULD COME BACK FOR US. OOH, THAT'S GOTTA HURT. SIX MINUTES TO PERIGEE ! QUICK. TO THE AUDITORIUM. AND NO RUNNING IN THE HALLS ! EMERGENCY POWER SYSTEM IS IN PLACE. SWITCH ON THE GLOBAL ELECTRODE. POWER UP THE PHOTON CHANNELER. ACTIVATE THE TRACTOR BEAM, QUICKLY ! WE'VE ONLY GOT FOUR MINUTES LEFT. ( Prickly ) YOU'VE GOT NO MINUTES LEFT, PHIL. THIS IS MY SCHOOL AND I WANT IT BACK. SORRY, PETE. YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL I FINISH MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. - NOW LET'S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD. - DON'T DO IT, DR. BENEDICT ! ( Chuckles ) DON'T DO IT ? YOU THINK AFTER ALL THIS PLANNING, ALL THIS WORK, YOU CAN GET ME TO STOP JUST BY SAYING, "DON'T DO IT" ? - WHAT IF WE ADD "PLEASE" ? - ( Sighs ) YOU KIDS JUST DON'T GET IT, DO YOU ? WELL, LET ME EXPLAIN THIS IN A WAY YOUR LITTLE UNEDUCATED BRAINS WILL UNDERSTAND. THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THINK TEST SCORES ARE TOO LOW. BUT IF A PERSON, SAY ME, COULD MAKE TEST SCORES GO UP, WHY, EVERYBODY'D FEEL BETTER. THEY MIGHT EVEN ELECT THAT PERSON... PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. NOW, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHICH COUNTRIES HAVE THE HIGHEST TEST SCORES ? - UM, JAPAN ? - GERMANY ? - TIERRA DEL FUEGO ? CANADA, ICELAND, NORWAY ! AND WHY ? BECAUSE IT'S SNOWING UP THERE ALL THE TIME. KIDS DON'T WASTE THEIR SUMMERS PLAYING BALL. THEY'RE INSIDE STUDYING. AND THAT IS WHY I'M GETTING RID OF SUMMER VACATION ONCE AND FOR ALL. YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG, OLD MAN. YOUR PLAN WILL NEVER WORK. SURE, MAYBE YOUR CRAZY LASER BEAM CAN MOVE THE MOON. MAYBE IT CAN EVEN MAKE IT SNOW ALL SUMMER. MAYBE YOU CAN GET RID OF LONG AFTERNOONS PLAYING BASEBALL, OR SUNNY DAYS DOWN BY THE LAKE OR WARM NIGHTS CAMPING OUT UNDER THE STARS. BUT THAT WON'T STOP US. WE'LL RIDE OUR BIKES THROUGH THE SNOW. WE'LL PLAY KICK BALL IN THE SLUSH, WE'LL CAMP OUT IN IGLOOS. YOU MAY TAKE AWAY SUMMER, BUT YOU'LL NEVER TAKE AWAY SUMMER VACATION. WELL, I CAN TRY. DO IT... NOW ! YES, SIR. BEGIN PHOTON CHANNELING. PHOTON CHANNELING BEGUN. SET MAGNIFICATION COORDINATES .073. - COORDINATES SET. - ENGAGE TRACTOR BEAM. - NO ! - ( Loud Bang ) HEY, TEACHER, LEAVE THEM KIDS ALONE ! - MS. FINSTER. - MURIEL, IT'S YOU. YOU'RE STILL A VISION OF LOVELINESS. YEAH ? AND YOU'RE STILL A TWO-BIT, RECESS-HATING PRETTY BOY. THAT HURT, MURIEL. BUT I'LL FORGIVE YOU IF YOU'LL JUST COME BACK TO ME. HA ! I'D RATHER EAT PLAYGROUND DIRT. THAT CAN BE ARRANGED, MY DEAR. NOT BEFORE I TAKE YOU DOWN. TAKE ME DOWN ? YEAH, RIGHT. YOU AND WHAT ARMY ? ME AND THIS ARMY. THE TEACHERS !

NO, NO, NO, NO NO, NO, NO, NO NO, NO, NO, NO NO, NO, NO, NO NO, NO, NO, NO NO, NO, NO, NO NO, NO, NO, NO NOBODY CAN DO THE SHIMMY LIKE I DO NOBODY CAN DO THE SHAKE LIKE I DO NOBODY CAN DO THE BOOGALOO LIKE I DO NOBODY CAN DO THE SHIMMY ( Continues ) ( Screaming ) FIRE ! LET ME TELL YOU NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY - ( Gasps ) - DRINK SODA, NINJAS ! HALT ! FLYING PRESS ! - NICE FLYING PRESS, SPINELLI. - THANKS. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT. NO, NO, NO, NO NO, NO, NO, NO YOU ! ( Ms. Finster ) STOP RIGHT THERE, KOJAK. IT'S GO TIME. NOBODY CAN DO THE SHAKE LIKE I DO NOBODY CAN DO THE BOOGALOO THANKS, MS. FINSTER. JUST DOING MY JOB, DETWEILER. HURRY ! THERE'S STILL TIME. FASTER, YOU IDIOT ! FASTER ! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, PHILLIUM. THE SEMESTER'S OVER FOR YOU, PAL. NOT SO FAST, PETE. YOU MIGHT FALL ASLEEP AND MISS THE FESTIVITIES. - HEY, PHILLIUM, THERE'S A SPOT ON YOUR TIE. - WHERE ? ( Ninja Screams ) - IT'S JAMMED. - YOU'RE TOO LATE, PETE. THIS TIME I WIN. VINCE ! THE PHOTON CHANNELER. AND FORGET WHAT THEY TOLD YOU. AIM IT. DON'T THROW IT. LOOK OUT ! SHE'S GONNA BLOW ! ( All Screaming ) ALL MY PLANS, MY HOPES AND DREAMS... RUINED. RUINED ! GET YOUR HANDS OFF THE SUIT, YOU CLASSLESS FEEB ! I AM THE FORMER SECRETARY OF EDUCATION. YEAH, YEAH. AND I'M THE FORMER PRINCESS OF MOROCCO. GET IN THE CAR. B-B-BUT IT'S ALL HIS FAULT. I WAS ONLY FOLLOWING ORDERS. I'LL TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE. GEEZ, WHAT A SQUEALER. COME ON, GROTKE. I'LL TAKE YOU ON. MY BOXING AGAINST YOUR MARTIAL ARTS. EAST MEETS WEST. WE'LL SEE WHO WINS. I DON'T KNOW, MURIEL. I'M ONLY SUPPOSED TO USE IT FOR SELF-DEFENSE. WHAT AN EXCITING SUMMER. T.J. SAVED THE WORLD... AND BECKY MADE ASSISTANT FRY CHEF AT FLOPPY BURGER. COME ON, ELLIE. THE REPORTERS WANNA TALK TO US ABOUT HOW WE RAISED A HERO. LISTEN, BECKY, I HEARD ABOUT HOW YOU SAVED MY LIFE AND EVERYTHING, AND... WELL, HERE, I THINK THIS IS YOURS. MY DIARY ? I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. YOU REALIZE THIS MEANS YOU DON'T HAVE ANY LEVERAGE OVER ME ANYMORE ? HEY, WHAT CAN I SAY ? MAYBE I'M JUST GROWING UP. GEE, YOU'RE AN ALL-RIGHT LITTLE BROTHER AFTER ALL. BUT, TEEJ, WHAT ABOUT THE EXTRA COPIES YOU GOT STASHED AWAY UP IN THE TREE HOUSE ? OH, I WAS JUST BLUFFING ABOUT THOSE. SO, TEEJ, WE GOT TWO WEEKS OF SUMMER VACATION LEFT. WHAT DO YOU SAY WE DO 'EM UP RIGHT ? BUT DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE TO GET BACK TO CAMP, WORK ON YOUR FUTURES AND ALL ? WELL, WE'VE BEEN THINKIN'. AND WE'VE DECIDED THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME FOR PREPARING FOR OUR FUTURES. BUT ONLY A LITTLE TIME LEFT FOR JUST BEING KIDS. SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE HEAD DOWN TO THE POND AND SKIP SOME ROCKS ? YOU GUYS GOT YOURSELVES A DEAL. OH, BOY ! MY FIRST SUMMER VACATION MEMORIES. UH, GUYS. - I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU. I FORGOT SOMETHING INSIDE. - OKAY, BUT HURRY. - PRINCIPAL PRICKLY ? - HUH ? OH, IT'S YOU, DETWEILER. I WAS JUST, UM, CLEANING UP THIS MESS PHILLIUM LEFT. GUY ALWAYS WAS A PACK RAT. LOOK AT THIS. A NORWEGIAN WEATHER MAP FROM 1956. LISTEN, SIR, I NEVER REALLY GOT A CHANCE TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE STUFF YOU DID. YOU KNOW, QUITTING YOUR GOLF GAME, TELLING BENEDICT TO LET ME GO, HELPING ME SAVE THE WORLD AND JUNK.
