Ever since I was little, there's never been a moment when I wasn't observed or monitored by my father. I liked this surveillance, it didn't bother me. Only one thing was forbidden: the Chateau de Pointilly, which was near our house, always lost in fog, almost unreal. It was a month since my father's last lover left. No woman had come to replace her yet. One night he tried to come into my room. It seemed perfectly natural to me. But I felt a certain surprise when I heard him. So I decided to run away from my father and left the house myself. That's when I saw you for the first time. After that, it wasn't you anymore. I made you up. I was living in a hotel with no more money, so I decided to write him and explain my situation. He understood. He sent me money and addresses. But I wasn't interested in his friends. I decided to make my own. I searched the papers for an apartment to rent. It was a big apartment, with a terrace looking out over a garden and plenty of rooms. I felt a complicity among all the men I knew that made me suspect there was some kind of plot. The invisible presence of the leader of the plot. The reality of the plot. The leader was my father. Sometimes I had the feeling someone was listening to me, that my actions were being monitored and controlled, like when I was a child and went to sleep. You have to wake up. I spent whole days in the streets. I was sure to find you. But when I thought I had found you, you wouldn't speak to me, nor hold me. You wouldn't even look at me. Have you heard of the Chateau de Pointillly? Pointilly? Sure. It's near my house. There... ...we will really meet. There? It scared and fascinated me. It seemed like a fairy tale. You're saying that like it's really possible. It's strange. We'll meet again at Pointilly. On one condition: you mustn't look for me. I went back to the apartment, confused, not knowing what to do. And I went back home. It felt as though a light had turned off inside me. When I saw Pointilly I was afraid. I waited, since you told me not to look for you. But I waited so long, I no longer had faith. I was just waiting. Then one day... Where are we going? This is the road to Pointilly? Why are you going this way? You've always forbidden me to come here, remember? What happens there? You'll see. You're taking me there. Why? He said, "We'll meet at Pointilly... ...but don't look for me." And now you're the one bringing me to Pointilly. You knew all along. You knew everything. You knew he was waiting for me there. Pointilly is the last stage of your education. It's where you'll finally be free of me. I don't know if I want to be free of you. You don't love him, then? Or is it because you think he lied to you? I've good reason to believe it. He was just one of your spies. You chose him for me. You organized everything. Even my disobedience was part of your plan. You calculated it all, my most secret movements, even Pointilly. You'll understand later on, when you've arrived, when I've left again. You used to say that on the way to school. This time it's not school. What is it? Tell me. I want to know. What if I don't want to go? You can choose. But you will only be able to choose Pointilly. But I can imagine... So imagine. But you will imagine only Pointilly. There's you. Me? Yes, there's you too. There was me. There's always you. When you're here, there's a possibility, another path. The end is Pointilly. We're arriving now. So then, what's going to happen? Everything will go up in smoke. I'm sleepy. Adaptation: Moira Tierney & Bruno Sarabia
