Alright, let's vote on the replacement of the lift, ﻿according to the quote from Elevators and Stairs, Inc. ﻿I made it at last! ﻿There was a line at the chemist. ﻿-Did you see I left the door open? -I did. ﻿You're just in time, Nuria. We're voting on replacing the lift. ﻿Right, all together. ﻿Votes in favour? ﻿-Concha, honey! -Oh, yes! I agree. ﻿Alright, a new lift is approved. ﻿About time. ﻿Any other items for the agenda? ﻿Then the meeting is over. Thank you for coming. ﻿'Bye, everyone, I have to go. I'm in a hurry. ﻿How's the new job? ﻿Fine, very stressed, very busy, but I'm happy. ﻿-I'll drop by one of these days. -Bye, see you. ﻿With the new lift maybe you can rent out your flat, right? ﻿-I already have a tenant. -Really? ﻿We sign the lease next week. ﻿Congrats. ﻿Hold on. Concha, get some beers. ﻿Alberto finally found a tenant for his flat. ﻿Who are you renting it to? ﻿A new workmate, his name's Joaquin. ﻿He's not my age by any chance? ﻿No, a bit younger, but he's single, Concha, so you never know. ﻿Is your company hiring in the current situation? ﻿Yeah, he's just started through a social integration program. ﻿He mentioned he was flat hunting, I told him mine was free, ﻿and done deal. ﻿-Social integration? -Yes. ﻿Did he just get out of prison? ﻿No, no... ﻿Not that I know anyway! ﻿Seven people with mental health issues joined the company ﻿through a work integration scheme. ﻿These programs are great, I didn't even know they existed. ﻿What do you mean by mental health issues? ﻿Is he crazy? ﻿Crazy? No. ﻿But he has a mental health issues, you just said so. ﻿He's under treatment for a mental health problem, ﻿but he lives a completely normal life. ﻿He works with me, and very well, actually. ﻿But what mental health issue are we talking about? ﻿I don't know, I didn't ask him. ﻿Alberto... ﻿-What's wrong? -"What's wrong? ". ﻿Hey, it's an issue... ﻿I'm fine with these social integration programs, schemes, whatever. ﻿But making photocopies isn't the same ﻿as having a guy with mental issues in the building, don't you think? ﻿He doesn't make photocopies, he's in IT. ﻿I don't care. ﻿What do you think someone with mental issues is? ﻿Someone jumping out of the lift with a knife, or what? ﻿Hold on one second... ﻿I get that you've never met anyone like him, ﻿you could have the wrong idea, I did too. ﻿But I work with him every day, and not just with Joaquin. ﻿Six more people with mental issues have joined the company, ﻿and there's not a single problem with them. ﻿Not a single problem? ﻿So they're the only people with no problems at work. ﻿No, I'm saying is that they are like any other co-worker. ﻿Some work hard, others slack off, some are friendly, some are rude... ﻿Some you connect with, others no, ﻿and I connect with Joaquin. ﻿Is Joaquin the cute guy with you the other day at the front door? ﻿Yes, that's Joaquin. ﻿He looked like a nice guy. ﻿He said hello to me and everything. ﻿Of course. Why wouldn't he? Joaquin is a normal guy. ﻿Not that normal if he's rented your flat at that price. ﻿-And with no renovations. -The flat's in perfect condition. ﻿That's why you haven't rented it out in months. ﻿Maybe this person values space more than today's fancy stuff. ﻿Or maybe he's crazy? ﻿Okay, that's enough. ﻿Joaquin has a mental issue, period. ﻿He probably watches his health better than any of us do. ﻿-Alberto, don't get annoyed. -I'm not annoyed. ﻿No, come here. Don't get mad. ﻿You must understand that this is awkward for all of us. ﻿We have old folks and kids here. ﻿My teenage daughter, Maria, is in and out all the time. ﻿What if Joaquin has an outburst ﻿because he forgot his meds, then he runs into her and hurts her... ﻿Maite, you're talking about someone I know, ﻿and Joaquin isn't aggressive. ﻿How do you know? ﻿I'm saying, I work with him! ﻿Do you really think I'd rent my flat to anyone who was trouble? ﻿Anything to rent the flat, eh? ﻿-What? -Yes. ﻿But what if he has the TV up full at all hours of the day and night? ﻿Then he'll be warned, like anyone. ﻿What if he sets the curtains on fire? ﻿I heard on the radio that these people smoke a lot. ﻿Or worse, he has his friends around. Imagine what they're like! ﻿Well, that's it. ﻿Don't you see how xenophobic you are? ﻿-Mad-ophobic. -What? ﻿-The fear of crazy people -Don't call him crazy, shit! ﻿-Okay. Why don't we vote on it? -Vote on what? ﻿On what? On whether you rent your flat to... people like that. ﻿What? Just what I needed! ﻿It's not that crazy, is it? ﻿Why not, Alberto? This affects all of us. ﻿We can't vote on this, it's not our flat. ﻿Sure, you live on the 3rd floor, but I live across the hall. ﻿And I live right above. ﻿Hold on, I'll rent my flat out to anyone I want. ﻿Yes, it's yours, ﻿but it's easy to leave us with the load while you live somewhere else. ﻿This could be very dangerous for all of us. ﻿We have to vote, right? ﻿Alright, alright, hold on... ﻿Let's get serious, okay? ﻿I'm renting the flat to Joaquin, whether you like it or not. ﻿First, it's my flat and I rent it to anyone I like. ﻿Second, he has the right to a dwelling, like anyone. ﻿Third, he's a great guy. ﻿And fourth, I need the money. ﻿Fine, it's your flat and you can do whatever you want with it. ﻿How many people have shown interest in it since it’s been on the market? ﻿Four? Eight? Twenty? ﻿Zero. Nobody. ﻿And the only person interested in renting your creepy old flat ﻿is someone with a mental illness. ﻿It's not a deciding factor, but it's a bit suspicious, isn't it? ﻿And fine, Joaquin has a right to a place to live, ﻿but we have the right to live in peace, right? ﻿And Joaquin's right doesn't mean to live in this particular flat. ﻿There are loads of flats available for rent. ﻿Okay, maybe he's charming, but that's not the point. ﻿And, fine, you need the money... ﻿What if you get a better offer? ﻿We could all help you to get a tenant that pays more. ﻿If we don't want crazies, our only chance is someone blind. ﻿Or it'll never get rented out. ﻿-I sign the lease next week. -Unless we all agree to pay you the rent! ﻿Even a bit more, we could pay even more than Joaquin's offering. ﻿-How much more? -Sure! ﻿As if I my mortgage wasn't enough, now you want me to pay Alberto's rent! ﻿I couldn't either. ﻿What if we don't replace the lift? ﻿Alright, why not, instead of spending money on the lift, ﻿we pay Alberto's rent? ﻿It wouldn't cost us more money. ﻿But then we have no lift? ﻿Would you rather be relaxed or get a new lift? ﻿We just voted for a new lift! ﻿Yes, because we didn't know what you just told us, Alberto. ﻿President, can we revoke the vote and rephrase the question? ﻿-Yes, we could, but... -Right, then let's vote. ﻿We've always voted on crucial things and this is crucial. ﻿-But the lift is falling apart. -So? ﻿If we have to use the stairs, so be it. ﻿I don't want to live with someone like that, I'm sorry. ﻿Me neither. ﻿I think your prejudices are outrageous. ﻿But I'm no Mother Theresa, so it's up to you. ﻿If you pay more for at least two years, and you all agree, ﻿I'll rent the flat to you. ﻿-Anyone know these? -What's that? ﻿-Olanzapine. -No. ﻿I take one with every breakfast. ﻿It's better on a full stomach so it doesn't hurt. ﻿Yeah... ﻿15 years ago... ﻿15 years ago I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. ﻿Oh, Nuri... ﻿Since then, my life hasn't been easy. ﻿When you tell people you have a mental issue, they run away. ﻿You only get rejection and fear. ﻿But you all know me, it's fine. ﻿I've been living in this building for seven years. ﻿Opposite you, Lucas. We haven't had a problem so far. ﻿We're even fond on each other, right? ﻿So, calm down, Fernando, ﻿I don't think anything bad will happen to you if Joaquin lives across the hall. ﻿I know I sometimes play the music too loud. ﻿Flamenco is my passion. So I'm sorry if I bothered anyone. ﻿And, yes, Teresa, I'm a smoker. ﻿But I smoke in the balcony, ﻿because I don't like a smelly flat when my friends visit me. ﻿And, Concha, the guy who helped you the other day with the electricity, ﻿the man with me, is my friend, Ramon. ﻿I don't know if Joaquin is the best tenant to live here. ﻿I couldn't say, because I don't know him, ﻿but you don't either, ﻿and you're stopping him from living here just because he has mental issue. ﻿What you said is true: ﻿People suffering from mental problems just want to live a normal life. ﻿We fight for it, every day. Like any of you! ﻿And from my heart I believe rejecting someone without knowing him, ﻿that's truly insane. ﻿That's the real madness. ﻿Well, do we vote, or what?
