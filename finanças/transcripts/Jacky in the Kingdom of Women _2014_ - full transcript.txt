Mush is all that humankind needs. It energizes and purifies the body. We need nothing more. Plantums are pure. They grow slowly in the earth. Horsums eat plantums. If we eat plantums what will horsums eat? Do we really wish to see them starving to death, victims of our impatience and boorishery? We must no longer eat plantums. We had the opportunity to eat them in olden days, but by our sins, our evil thoughts, we ate too many. I love you! One day a poetess said: "How modest, simple and clear, "the day I was dazzled." Gentlemen and ladies, here we are today at the Grand Mushery Palace, where the General will soon give her speech. The Holy Mares. Teardrops of innocence, here to cover us in purity. Bless us, Holy Mares. Keep misfortune away. Make our lives shine forth in sublimity and magnificence. Here come the members of government. Minister of the Economy, Minister of Armed Forces and Minister of Horsums. All of them here to listen to the General. And this month's convicts who of course will be executed during the ceremony. Fewer and fewer each month. The country is getting purer. But still, quite a few. And here comes the Colonel, Bubunne XVII... who waves to the cheering crowd with her aide-de-camp, Zonia. Ah, the Colonel... Greatly cheered. Greatly adored. Here she comes at last, the General... our beloved General, Bubunne XVI... Here she is. Ever faithful to her post. 34 years of mutual love with her people. First, a traditional poestry. "O horsums who roam this land in freedom, help the plebs, graze their evil thoughts, O horsums... help the plebs, lessen their pain... "Men, revolt! "Resist the Bubunnic bitchures!" This is blasphemery! Blasphemery? Look in my bag. I made them for you at the factory so you'd be handsome. Undums! My great mom. I hate this dump. 4 more girls proposed to you. - And so? - They can pay tons. - And so? - So I said no. I have heard foreign powers who defend sleazery, dykery and sodomage claim that in the Popular and Democratic Republic of Bubunne... men have no rights. Taste this. When I hear those lies, those feloneries, I think of my mother and my mother's mother and my mother's mother's mother and her mother and her mother and of the struggles they endured to uphold the simple teaching of Bubunne the First, "Get married, "eat your mush... "and pray to horsums to purify your souls." Bitchure! Dykery! Your hair has licery. I'll buy you some shampoonery. Don't bother. Believe me, it doesn't smell good. After your lesson. Yes, Mom. Buy yourself a new veilery. Families of the First Class... families of the Pleberie, it is with a heavy heart, full of a special emotion, that I speak to you today. The Holy Mares spoke to me last night and they said: "General, if you want granddaughters, "is it not time for you “to let your daughter "become the General?" But beforehand, she must choose her Big Dummy and get married. So the Holy Mares said to me: “It is time for you to prepare "the Grand Bubunnery Ball "for your daughter and every single man "in the land." JACKY IN THE KINGDOM OF WOMEN Holy horsum, speak to me. My soul is pure. Graze my sins. Let the Colonel pick me. Say I'm handsome enough to become Big Dummy. Holy horsum, speak to me. My soul is pure. Let the Colonel pick me. I heard the horsum. What? I swear! He said who'll be Big Dummy. What did he say? That it will be you, Vergio. My big brother! - It's you! - Oh, Bubunne! Horsums know what humans cannot. He said I'd find a girl there too... How are you? Hello, cousin. So Juto, having visions? Lying is blasphemery. I'm not lying. How's it going? Bubunne, fine. Your mom, my aunt? Bubunne, good. Your mom and dads? We're all bubunne. I won't ask about your dad. He's in Horsum Land. Peace to him in Holy Horsum prairie. Bubunne. Trying your luck at the Grand Bubunnery Ball? - Sure. Not you? - Yes. There's only one a century! And he'll be chosen. The Colonel chooses. She'll pick me. I hope so, horsums be willing. Isn't Jacky hot? I'm going to marry him. He's mine! Since Vergio is handsomer, the Colonel will choose him and leave us Jacky. I'll hook you up there. Go graze elsewhere. Jacky! They're just kids. Replacing your worn-out veilery? They're ugly. Fine for you. And this one? Pretty fabric. Gorgeous, but too expensive. They are nice. I'll take one. Want one? Sure. They're not too expensive. One veilery for Vergio. And one for Juto. Try it on. I'll they don't fit, we won't wear them. Pencil and paper. I'm learning to write. Rare for a boy. So you write those tracts? About men killing women. That really is blasphemery! You? Letters from readers. A poem from Museau, by Vergio Pondina. That's me. "Ode to Night Horsum". Cascades of your braids, eyes so wise Your snout has clout Your hoof is so aloof Smiling, you're beguiling Mom taught me to write. She's proud I'm in the paper. Don't look so glum. You're my favorite. The handsomest one of all. I think of you every day. That's nice. Even in bed. Blasphemery! Take that box of hoof urns to Mrs. Pruneau. Bitch. 12 bubes. 12 bubes. Mr. Jacky... You mom turned me down again. It's annoying. Because she won't marry me off. No idea why. Why not my daughter? She has a bike. Not many girls do. Don't come every day if you don't like her. I could eat you up. Me too, but it's time to go. Leave me, cousin. When will I see you? When I get in touch. Put on a veilery! What's it to you? I was with my cousin. Just how many cousins do you have? You're right. I have a big family. All girls. A veilery is required with cousins too. You have to make a triangle in the E. Do it. Listen to this. Sounds are blasphemery. So is eating plantums. Eat mush. Will you listen to me? Abroad, people eat spinach. They listen to music, eat meat. Some even eat fish. Heard of fish? When we go away, you better relax. Actually... Read me your poestry for today. So... "Horsum, come, horsum, my chum, "horsum, so glum. "To you I succumb with me, become one." We said no more horsums. New subjects... You go on about free speech but everything I say is wrong. No one abroad prays to horsums. I keep telling you. I meant to say, Julio, I don't want to go anymore. What? - We almost have papers. - Big deal. Big deal? What would your father say? He was dying to go. He left you a treasure. There's no treasure in this rat hole. Guess again. There is. So show me. Now I'm lying? It's come to that? I prefer the Bubunnery Ball. Become the Colonel's Big Dummy, and have lots of girls. You kidding me? Not at all. I've become my own captain, as you say. So leave. I'll go alone. I preferred your dad. How about that treasure? After "Three Horsums up North", Bradi VVune stars with Mit Kronk in his first dramatic role. Horsum Dazzle A dazzling miniseries, starting tomorrow. Jacky, I'm so sad and blue... I'm feeling old... Come on, Mom... Once you're Big Dummy, you'll forget me. You'll forget your old mother. The Colonel may not choose me. Every woman adores you. Why would she be different? If she chooses me, you'll live in the palace too. And teach your granddaughters to shoot. What a good son you are. I'll see to everything. I'll be my own captain. Was Julio happy about the Bubunnery? Very. What a good guy. He's always taken care of you. Your father's death let him distraught. I still remember when dad's heart stopped beating. We were conceiving you, he climaxed, and... Horsum, come Horsum, my chum... Horsum, so glum Horsum, to you I do succumb... Go home! What's going on? They're making us pay for the Ball. What? It's open to all maiden boys. It's so expensive, no one can go. The General says there are too many maiden boys this year. If you can't pay, go home. The Ball will be broadcast live. It's 40,000 bubes per single man. Back to your mush! Isn't it pretty? It sparkles in the sun. That's enough... Buying one too? What do you think? You strike it rich? News to me. She hit the jackpot. How's the family? Better when we don't see you. Listen to her. You're lucky your mommy loves her family. You got handsome. You bet he is. If ever you need money, we'll lend you some. Won't you, honey? We'll see. No, actually. Who needs you or your idiot husbands? I'm no idiot. Do something. She insulted us. Punish your sister. You going too, Juto? Maybe. I'll go with my brother. Total waste of money. Jacky is going to marry the Colonel. And you'll stay here. We'll go to the palace in Fontaine, with Vergio, and you'll stay in this rat hole. Sorry. Pay or get on your way! Let's go buy my ticket. Holy Horsums... help me. I can't spend my life with a toothless pleb. Let me love you, my little horsum Let me wed you, my little horsum Let me have your baby... Not now, you imbecile! Leave my son alone! Will we find a way to buy it? Make me some mush to clear your head. I'll do it myself, treasure. Treasure? It's almost time. This is way too much. I'm not getting married. But I love you. But you shouldn't. I like my freedom. I'm not finished, cousin. It's Jacky. I need my treasure. I said no. No way! Go to your Bullshittery Ball. What Bullshittery Ball? I'm his cousin. Careful. Remember how your mom got hanged? You can too. No but... what exactly did I do? Jacky says you have a treasure that's his. Sheriff, it's a metaphor. I use it to motivate him to learn to write. There is a treasure! I bet my dad left me money. We'll have a look, Jacky. It reeks here. What is it? I smell nothing. Explains why you're single. Look what I found. What's this? Foreign press. It's forbidden. Forget about my treasure. Come see. Fuck. We hit the jackpot. The tracts! You wrote them?? We've been looking for you. Cuff him. Sorry. I had no idea. Don't worry. No problem. It wasn't on purpose. See you in the Great Prairie. Good boy. You knew nothing? Of course not! What will happen to Julio? We often don't know people we think we know. Foreign propaganda is the greatest risk we face. You're a good Bubunnian. To thank you, the Holy Mares gave you this. No, we can't! I was looking for the person behind the tracts. If you become Big Dummy, remember me. If he's not chosen, I'll ask for his hand. You knew. You were there every day! I swear on the horsums. If you're lying... Your boots are dirty. I'll wash them. Where did you go walking? You're filthy. Oh little horsum, cleanse my soul Want to eat? I just mashed the mush. Hungry? You've been acting differently... Anything wrong? Got any fancier veilery? Why not those? I need a white one. With an sparkly cappum and a leashy. Going to the Ball? How nice for Corune. Mom insists I give it a try. You know her. I'll order you one, but if you get chosen, hire me. Give me a discount. Hear about Julio? Getting hanged. Really? I never liked him. Mom, what... Sorry, Jacky. Why is she on this? Her boot soles were polished! She slipped at the warehouse. Broke her neck. I slipped, Jacky. Sorry, I slipped. But you'll... Won't you be okay? The Lost Prairie... the horsums... They're calling me. I see them. To the morgue. Napping? No, uncle. Don't call me uncle. We're hungry! I'm coming, Brunu. We all know people who've heard horsums speak... I hear horsums in my head. When I pray. - What do they say? - They say... "Juto... can you hear me?" I say I do but they don't really hear. Wonderful. Hear that, babe? Juto... can you hear me? Stop laughing. You remind me of myself as a kid. At your age, I was helping my father wash the floor. Suddenly I heard something in my head. A voice. Dad was busy cleaning the toiletums. So the voice said to me, "Brunu... "Brunu can you hear me? "Come outside." So I went out. What did I see out there? I don't know. A baby horsum. That's who was talking. Our family is pure of heart. Why does he have to be here all day? He's family. And we took all his monery. Watch what you're doing! Still unmashed. It's not mashed! This isn't mashed... It's not mashed! You call this mashage? No, it's not mashed... Shut up! But honey, he's driving us crazy! I mashed it. Are you calling her a liar? A bad judge of mashage? - Enough. - You're too easy on him. Go remash. It's no problem. Hurry! If Julio hadn't got arrested, he could have taken him in instead of us. By the way, Julio escaped from prison. No sign of him anywhere. Meanwhile, his house burnt down. Mysteriously. Maybe he burnt too. It makes sense. What are you saying? Julio is dead? Yeah, sorry. Off to the toilet um. To take a jacky. Mr. Jacky? I'm getting married. I'm glad for you. Nice boy from Rateau. Mom is making an offer this afternoon. I hope you'll be very happy. Your veilery and sparkly cappum. I think you ordered it. I'm broke now. Who'll pay for it? Auntie and Brunu will never let me go to the Bubunnery Ball. Mr. Jacky... I can help you. - I'll take you on my moped. - Really? That's what it's for. I know Brunu and the others are mean. It would be so nice of you. I still love you, Jacky. All I want is for you to be happy. Can I speak to you frankly? Let's take stock of things. Yes, ma'am. You'll see. You'll like my idea. Like it when I do this? This? Naughty boy! Corune? I brought your dummy home. You'll like it here. Corune? Where are you? Come out, manure. Come the hell out! Manure! He won't come out. Come out. I'll be nice. No hitting. Come out. I'll be nice. I'll be nice. Get the hell out, manure! He hid it in his undums! We're nice to you. We give you a home... and you lie! And steal! The sheriff gave it to me. The veilery he stole is nicer than mine! I preferred to come see you instead of the sheriff. I already punished Corune. He'd come and hang out. They balled. Her dummy left. This veilery cost me a fortune. - A gift from me. - Shut up! You fall into the first trap the first dummy sets. He struts his stuff. I was just shopping. We'll all end up hangers! - You'll get us hanged. - Calm down. What if everyone finds out? - And our reputation? - We can work it out. How so? You always want to work things out! What about the sheriff? Shut up! I'm willing to forget. Go on. If Jacky marries her. One lost, one gained. It's a deal. I need to think. We'll get rid of him. What's to think about? - It's perfect. - Shut up. Don't think too long. Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. You're crazy! She's crazy. I'll pay you in horsums. In the meantime... some monery. You're out of your mane! For the veilery. And the cappum? You'll pay for this, little shittum. A lot! Come on, Juto. For you. You might as well give it a try. Come on. Juto. The cappum. Why does he get it? He doesn't stand a chance. Don't get on my nerves. Come on... Come out now. I won't hit you. Go into your cubbyhole. Our Colonel aced her scholastic training. She did military training at Fontaine's Bubunne Academy. In the war against perverted foreigners she began leading women. As commander of the infantry, she made many decisive calls, even killed with her bare hands... The Colonel is not faint-hearted. Lucky for us. Colonel, I love you a lot. Colonel... you are so hot. "Colonel, so fine "I am on cloud nine "To you I do impart "The leashy to my heart" How do you find all this? It's amazing. Really? She'll choose you. Think so? Juto, hear that? Get dressed! Jacky, hurry up! Slowpoke. You took so long you barely have time for my hair. Don't worry. Look. You'll look ridiculous. You're not even a contender. Look. - Your head! - What's wrong with it? You're very handsome. Don't contradict me. Sorry. You're right. Jacky says I'm ugly! Enough. Come comb me. Hurry up, you too! What the hell? What about the right side? He sucks at brushing the right side! Do the brush stroke! Or his hair will be all flat! Let me see with the leashies. Give it to me. Give me that! They look great. I wanted you to get out of the way. My leashy, Your Majesty. My leashy, your Majesty. Aren't they handsome? Handsome, gorgeous. The bubus is leaving! To the bubus. Later, manure-breath! Now, a surprise for our viewers because with us today is the famous actor Mit Kronk. Mit Kronk is here. Yes, because Mit Kronk is participating in the Grand Bubunnery Ball. Good evening. Welcome. Hello, ladies! Mit Kronk, you're also giving it a try. What man, deep down, has not entertained the possibility to woo the Colonel and become Big Dummy? Leave, Jacky. Run away from here. Poor Jacky ... We're broadcasting live in Fontaine, awaiting the bubus with the last candidates for tomorrow’s Grand Bubunnery Ball. Let's see who's first out. Here are... Good evening. What's your name? Where are you from? I'm Vergio! Is this TV? I'm Juto. We're from Museau. The Colonel will choose us! Both of you? Great! We'll purify ourselves all night long with the horsums So we're ready tomorrow. I'm going to win! I'll be the winner! Why are you in the rain? You're not allowed in the forestery! I was getting some fresh air... And your ticket for the Ball? You missed the bubus! I had to give it to Juto. Your family never gives you a break. We'll see you home. I want some more fresh air. We know you're trying to turn us on with your "fresh air” routine. Peek-a-boo. Have a look at my front lawn. See it? Harder, asshole! Now you're gonna suck. Suck it. That's real good sucking. Attention! What's this crappery? To whom am I speaking? Recognize me, bitchure? You're alive! Know what happened? The first night they locked me up they said: "Listen up, "either ball us or hang like your mom." - And so? - So I accepted. I had no choice. Every single day. How did you manage? I heard about you and went crazy. I escaped but you were already at Auntie's. I hid here in the middle of the forestery. I heard noises. I thought they'd come for me. Why are you dressed as a woman? I'm leaving this country. You're coming. Nothing's keeping you here. Plantums... It's not bad here. Look. They so young, so pretty. "Turnips”. You see? I can pick them... like this. It's forbidden. And incredibly valuable. - You can sell them? - For a fortune. Lucky you. We're going to the Palace. That's right. I know someone there who pays a lot for this. With that, plus my savings, we'll be able to buy passports. And I have your treasure... Come in the shed with me. It looks great on you. You're a really gorgeous babe. So like your dad. This was Dad's treasure? And I thought it was monery. We founded a secret movement for men's rights. Meninism. This woman's outfit was part of his escape. With me. Daddy... He never made it. He died during orgasm. He was emotional. Balled your mom once and... poof. Still... you're the product of his love. That's important. Little horsum... Did you hurt him? I trained him. Rope in the mouth, this thing on top, now we can ride him. Little horsum... I named him Blue Coco. Abroad, horsums have great names. You like Blue Coco? Don't try reading its mind. It's a horsum. Come closer. Touch him. He's nice. He'll help you too. In his own way. Your little horsum isn't dead. He was tired. He's taking a nap. He'd have got us caught. | saw he was dead. You're a horsum Killer. Know what? He went to the Great Prairie. I'll eat your plantums. Give me that bag. - Bellyache. - I'm glad! Put that torchery away. It's broad daylight. It's so pretty here. This makes me uncomfortable. Leave us alone. Your cousin! Well, well. It's been a while. You disappear, you reappear... I could have you executed. Lump of horsum manurum! Scumbag! They're ripe. I have 15 pounds of them. For 100,000. On the double. If I have you hanged, they're mine for free. I have a new crop coming. Too bad. You don't love me... Yes, I do. - Really? - You know it. You love me? Show me, then. That you love me. So? He can join in if he wants. What is he... a boy or a girl? Go wait for me outside. Come on... This stunning painting shows Bubunne Mum XV, with the General as a child. This one shows the General with her six sons and the Colonel as a child. - When we see Mushery? - We'll go shortly. Are you looking for something? No, your Excellency. My daughter. The Grand Mashage may begin. Excellency, may I introduce my dummy? My name is Juto Pondina. Pretty name. So? What do I care? He's eligible. Good-looking, isn't he? Officer in the Army? You can't be an officer anywhere else. You're from the Plebery? Yes, but as they say, a dummy has no caste. Pretty veilery. But it's not your size. Too big. Like your nose... He's extremely well-hungery. Look at this magnificence. Two hoofs long. I hope he uses it someday. If you prefer, I'm available. Just buy me from my wife. I don't love her anymore. Vergio's with the Colonel. She took his leashy. He's my brother! Come on... Your Excellency, he's my son. Shall I remove them? Let them continue. Introduce the husband um. I'm very, very moved. This is Vergio. He's 19. Look how gorgeous he is. Otherwise... I have him. My name is Juto. Pretty name. This one writes. He's been published in "Little Horsum". And this one... He's here. Tempting. I can't decide... You have all night. Yes, you're right. I'll take my time. I must see everyone. Go back to Museau. To your ditch. Who is this lieutenant? I don't know. Your name”? Jacqueline. Of foreign descent? Looking for a husband um? All these choices confuse me. I'm an independent woman. Your regiment? Zonia, we're done working. Jacqueline, would you come mush in my drawing room? I'd love to. - Come. - I'll join you. Show our foreign friends the Grand Mushery. Who'd leave a ball that's held once a century? No one. I'm dying to. What a bore! What a small horsum. I prefer that size. They smell better than big ones. Your Majesty... Do horsums really understand you, as legend has it? You're funny. I spray them with perfume... but they still smell bad. Is your Dummy chosen? You bet. My mother chose him a while ago. I'm marrying Mit Kronk. The famous actor. These festivities are pure folklore. No way... And you? You say you're an independent woman. What does that mean? That I'm my own captain. I want to open up to you. Do you mind? For some reason I want to share my secret. I have no desire to become General. I couldn't give a damn. Why? It must be so wonderful. Becoming like my mother is not my fantasy. I'd like to have been a writer. They're people who live abroad. They write books. Yes, I know. Really? I'm learning to write. I write. What do you write? Poestries. Please recite one. Timidity is so charming... I am trying my hand at autobiography. Know what it is? It's telling your life as if it were a novel. My life is unusual. I figure... who knows, maybe it can serve as an example. What a bubunne idea. I could do the same. Mine is interesting too. My life is incredible. Tell me about it. I want to know everything. It's a little too sad. Plantums. You too. Take one. Go on, take one. Bite it. I'm sorry. It's strange. You attract me like a magnet. Are you a dykery? Excuse me? To tell you the truth... I'm not an officer. - Or a woman... - Like the others. I'm starting to understand. What's this? I throw you a party and you vanish. Stop it, Mother. I'm relaxing. We're just talking. Get lost or get hanged. Dancery time. We'll show the plebs your dummy. Time to marry off my mistake. The Bubunnery Ball is the occasion to meet Army officers if you're a maiden pleb. Are you out of your hind? You disappeared. The Colonel likes girls. She doesn't want to be General. Who the hell cares? Look! After we bribe Customs, there won't be much. Let's get out of here. Bubunnery! The Big Dummy has been chosen. Jacky? It's you. It really is you. It iIsn’'t. It is too. Your big nose. In a wiggum! Shut up. What the hell? He has fake titumsl! Cheatage! He's a man! With a cockard! Blasphemery! Colonel, I love you! It's Jacky! Stop filming! Catch him! I'm innocent. See that? It's the sewer pipe. Move, we can't see! Sewage enters the turbines which recover the organic matter. What a great idea. It's mixed with a vitamin paste in the vat. Fresh mush is sent to all the country's mini-musheries. People produce their own food. How ecological. They find their own shittum yummy. We'd like to get the patent. Excellency! A problem at the Bubunnery. It's shittum! News flash: Mit Kronk chosen Big Dummy If the Mushery is working, there's no problem. Untreated mush was distributed all over. We'll find him and execute him. Don't. Bring him here first. The General gave orders. I'm the next Gen... Come out! You? My mother died, or I'd have come with my ticket. Don't kill me. Put this back on. It's you I want more than anyone. Are you a terrorist? I love you. I always have. Spare me. I wanted to be chosen. Who knew you were a dykery? Take pity! You won't shoot me. Dykery is blasphemery. I have a cockard like all boys. The first time I ever really wanted someone. You were so beautiful. I wanted to wed you, to have your girls. Kiss me. Like before... like in my dreams. I don't want to. You do. Shut your eyes or die. Kiss me again. Don't stop. It's serious. They won't eat mush. Your mother may send troops. We'll wait. I'll find a plan. Find it fast. Look. Jacky... They think you came as an officer because you had no monery. That you did it out of love. Oh Bubunne... What do we do? Listen up! Jacky is a hero! The Ball was too expensive! Mush is shittum! Follow me! I don't know what to think. Or what I like. Or who I am. I've always pretended. I love who you are. Even if you don't know. Really? Everything's fine. You're not a dykery. Good start. We'll go away. Both of us, far from here. We'll live naked, on a beach. Write stories for each other. We'll laugh. Hold me tight. There he is. I smelled man sweat. What are you doing? You're not General yet. I'm doing my job. It's me... your Big Dummy. Beat it! I was chosen. It's over. Go mash your shittum! Give us back Jacky! He's the people's dummy! Let's go in! You know what? You listening? I'll take a stick... And hit you under your eyes. Then the forehead. As hard as I can. After a while, when your eyes stop seeing, I'll pop them both out. And put them in your mouth. Then I'll take your jaw and force you to chew your eyes. Then I'll wipe your eye juice... Come here! We don't even have TV. Here's the hero. Not kneeling? We're sentenced to die. So why kneel? He has a strong personality. Time is of the essence. I'll hurry. I have excellent news for you. I want you to marry my daughter. You're the idol of the people. Instead of killing them, I'll make you Big Dummy. Jacky, this is so wonderful! Your daughter refuses the post. I've changed my mind. I want to be General. Marry me. The people want it. Me too. So it's settled. Shall I hang them as a wedding gift? Not really. We didn't do anything. Please, Jacky! We love you. No, Majesty. Plebs don't have it easy. As you wish. What are you doing? Mother... Cutting out your... He knows your secret. Stick out your tonguery. You can be a real woman if you want to. You have a magic tonguery. I couldn't live without it. Nor I, without yours. So we're equals. We are. Majesty! We want a democratage! Kill everyone until we find Jacky! Keep on looking for him. Calm down. It's me, Jacky. I'm alive. I'm alive. Plebs, worry not. I am the new General. And I've chosen my Big Dummy. It's Jacky. I was chosen. I am the Big Dummy. I'm so happy to see you. I figured you dead. I was seeing red. I am happy. I found love. Quick bullet in her head? Love is love... No fighting it. General... This is Julio. With the Mushery in disrepair, the General accepted foreign aid, to everyone's delight. The kid can wait. Beat it. It's for us. A huge program for growing plantums was initiated. Jacky, our new Big Dummy, toured and promoted eating plantums. The interesting thing about plantums is that you just plant them and they grow. Pretty... but a little green. To set an example, holy horsums help with the crops. The man known as "the people's Jacky" returned to Museau where he was not forgotten. Cheered and acclaimed, he showed everyone he was the same simple man as before, thrilled to rediscover the streets of his childhood. He kissed everyone and celebrated the people. Just a few words, Jacky. Lots of joy, lots of emotions, coming back. Coming back to Museau, my childhood town. I think of lots of people. Mom, who'd be proud of me...
