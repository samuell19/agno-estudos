MAN [ON SPEAKER]: Prisoner3759, James A. colonial surgeon from the French speaking colony of Eurasia, you have been tried by the Allied Federal Court and have been found guilty. The punishment for this crime is life without the possibility of parole. By action of the convening authority in the matter hearing this crime, such sentence, having been unanimously approved and confirmed by this court, and no pardon or clemency granted, it is now my solemn duty to carry out the punishment. Have you any last words before sentence is carried out? Hello? Hello? Parlez vous anglais? Fuck yourself. Proceed. WOMAN [ON SPEAKER]: Warning, outer lock open. Stand clear. Release in 7 seconds. I cannot stress enough the severity of the situation. Tension is running dangerously high here. The conference hasn't even started yet, President Bradford, and theout-world colonial delegation has everyone in an uproar. They're threatening all out war if their demands aren't met. These truculent threats are just a brazen show. They want everyone to believe there's still a warrior race, Vikings in space. The key is to grant them some small concessions that allow them to retreat with honor. You'll leave that to me. But there's talk that your policies are too weak, that you haven't been firm enough with the imperial parliament. They're saying you're sick and too ill to attend, or rule. I have spent 10 years nailing down peace in the Federation. I will not allow a bunch of renegades to sabotage it. I will be there in two days in plenty of time for the conference. You just keep a lid on things till I get there. I'll do my best. I'm counting on you. Bradford, out. This situation could get out of hand, we could be facing a damned Holocaust. I just hope I stall the ambassador until we get there. He bought it. I hope so. I look terrible. No, you look great-- for a hologram. Once I get over this, whatever the hell it is, I better get a new one digitized. Even I could tell it wasn't me. I'm not sure I trust these doctors of yours. Ah, it's because you're paranoid. Only way you're concerned. And don't think I don't appreciate it. Do you have that report on fleet readiness? It's in my quarters. All right. Then, let's take a look at it, just in case those callers start bluffing. Gramps, gramps! Hey. Hey, buddy. Why-- how are you doing? I've been practicing this new card trick. Well, come on, show me, how? O'Shack taught it to me. Yeah? Pick one. Just take a card? Yeah. All right. OK. Now, I need you to hold my hand and think hard about that card. All right. Are you thinking? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I'm-- I'm thinking. I'm thinking. All right. I'm beginning to see it. It's-- it's the queen of clubs. Oh, dear. Well, uh, you were close. Oh, man. Well, maybe a little more practice, huh? Maybe. Well, I hope your school workis coming along as well, huh? Ask Devin. Well, sir, it seems he's developed an allergic reaction to math. Well, we had better hopes for you than a life of petty crime. Grandpa. Yeah? Will I ever have a dad? Well, you know, buddy, sometimes things don't work out the way we'd like them to. Well, sometimes we have a lot of people around us-- I'll take that as a no. Sir, it's time for-- It's getting late, Daniel. Time for us to be going. Night, grandpa. Yeah. Good night, pal. Why doesn't gramps wantme to know that he's sick? I can handle that. Well, you're a prettysmart kid, you know that? Smart enough to know that you think I'm going to bed. But I'm not going. Oh, is that right? Daniel. Daniel. MAN [ON SPEAKER]: All personnel, please report to emergency stations. Daniel! Sir, it's time to go to the life pod. - What about Daniel? - Don't worry. He'll be taken care of. What's going? Someone set the alarm in engineering. MAN [ON SPEAKER]: Commencingemergency evacuation procedure. Daniel! There you are. Come on! Come on, leave them. Leave them. MAN [ON SPEAKER]: Depressurization warning, life pod release in 60 seconds. Daniel-- where-- I believe they're fine, Mr. President. Prepare for emergency pod drop. Impact in 45 seconds. MAN 1: [inaudible], grenades. MAN 2: Got it. MAN 1: Flare. MAN 3: Yes, sir. MAN 1: Take your seats. MAN 4: Cover up! He's going to need his medicine. So when we land, you find him. But first we gotta get there. You're hurting me. Deal with it. 30 seconds. There's a planet beneath us. It's Earth. Who could've done this? Who could have done this? 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Oh, God! Oh, no. Oh, no. - O'Shack. Oh, no, no. O'Shack. Where the hell are we? Earth-- what's left of it. It's where everything started and almost ended. About 50 years ago, they converted it into a penal colony, but later they gave up on that. And now? No one's really sure. Doesn't look so bad. Looks can be deceiving, captain. Oxygen content is dangerously low. There's little, if any, atmosphere protection against solar radiation, toxin levels are off the scale. God only knows what lives in these jungles. I'd say we're in a world of trouble. O'Shack, come on. We're going to be OK, right? Yeah. Yeah. We need to find Bradford's pod, fast. When his locator signal is weak, it's going to be hard to pinpoint him. How do we find him? We do it the old fashioned way, we go looking. MAN: All right. Let's go. Let's move out. What happens if Bradford doesn't get his medication? In 4 hours he'll probably be nauseous, in 6 he'll start to tremble, in 24 he'll be lucky to be alive. MAN [ON SPEAKER]: Come in, escape pod one. Escape pod one, are you out there? Escape pod one, do you read me? They're all dead. Are you all right, sir? You're going to be fine, son. You're going to be just fine. I'm OK. Look, let's get them off the ship immediately. Come on, son. Check the perimeter. Make sure we're secure. Grab over here. Come on. CAPTAIN [OVER SPEAKER]: [inaudible]?? Negative, captain. Everything seems fine. Captain, Captain. Beck, I repeat, you're breaking up. Repeat. MAN [OVER SPEAKER]: Thought I saw something, but the area is secure. Copy. Sir, it's clear, sir. We'd better get out of here. What was that? Probably just some animal. Well, Mr. President, how nice of you to drop in. I should've known you had something to do with this. Point, you see any movements? Seems clear. MAN [OVER SPEAKER]: Keep tight. Seems a little stronger now. We're heading west. Copy. What the hell was that? Point, Beck, come back. Point, Beck, come back. Oh, Christ. Hold your fire. Hold your fire. Stay close to me. Something just moved. I don't know, but I think we're in deep shit. Look out! Let's get the hell out of here. We've got to keep going! Keep going. You've got to keep going. Don't stop. No. What about you? Let's go, corporal. Get them out of here. That's an order. - You heard him. Let's go. Down. Who the hell are you? Tarkin. Follow me. Quickly. This way, this way. This way. Keep going. Hey, he's just a boy, and he's hurt. Then leave him. How do we know we can trust him? You don't. Oh, shit. Go, go, jump. Get on with it. I-- I-- I can't swim. Now's a good time to learn. I can't. You bastard. Who the hell do you think you are anyway, Tarzan? You could have gotten us all killed. Cool. Who the hell are those guys? They call themselves the Cali. In their tongue, it means the dead. Oh, great. We must go. They'll be here soon. As you can see, it isn't much. Our population is shrinking so rapidly, we'll be extinct in five years. The water's radioactive, food poisoned. We were left with nothing, no medicines, no vaccines, nothing. Skunk, left to rot and die. But your civilization calls this justice. Kyla, it was inside the pod, just as we expected. Undamaged? Yes. You know what to do. Move! Back off, or he's dead. Ohh. Nice move, though. I tell you, guys, you're just going to love it here. Quick, before I change my mind. the power of lifeand death, Caesar's prerogative. But what is Caesar without Rome? What is Alexander without worlds to conquer? You-- you seem to be doing all right for yourself. I rule a rock in the middle of a wasteland on the shores of a poisoned sea. I am the lord of nothing! But you can change all that. All you need to do is give me the code, just enter the proper sequence, and a rescue ship would be dispatched immediately. No. I won't do it. Of course you will. You just need to be properly motivated. You can threaten me all you want. Threaten you? No. Threats are for men without power. Lord Kyla, we have found the other pod. It's-- Empty. Who else have you brought me? No one. You were never a good liar. We did find this, sir. Now, who could this belong to? A boy, perhaps, a very special boy, one who has not seen his father in quite some time. He thinks you are dead. All the more reason I should find him and introduce myself. Don't you think? My hands, they hurt. It's all over your face, too. It'll dissipate in a little while. His skin is not used to the sun yet. What kind of a world is this? A harsh one. He's bleeding internally. His ribs are broken and his lung is punctured. Keep him warm. MAN: You can't tell that just by looking at it. Can't I? Isn't there anything that you can do for him? Like what? I don't know, but I can't just sit here and watch this man die. Get him off well in the next 18 hours and he might stand a chance. Don't worry about me. You have to find the president. He's right. We only have less than 24 hours to find him, or there'll be no rescue ship. Well, I got news for you. He's locator didn't make it through the river. Oh no. So we don't even know where he is. I bet he knows. Well, if he does. He has to take us to him. I don't have to do anything. In three days, there'll be a conference to determine the fate of a million colonists. The president has to be there. Good luck. I'm-- I'm begging you to help us. You don't understand what you're up against. Well, then why don't you just tell us? Kyla. Kyla? Lord of the insiders. If he's got your president, and he does, he's not just going to let him go. Can't he be reasoned with? Not a chance. Kyla wants one thing, something everyone wants here, to get off this planet. He'll keep your prisoners alive long enough to do that, then-- I'll offer you a complete pardon if you get him out. How do I know I can trust you? You don't. I bid you welcome, father. I apologize for the surroundings. I'm sure it's not what you're used to. But under the circumstances, it's the best I could do. Leave us. With the men, I have to keep up a certain imagine. You understand. I'm not sure that I do. In a pack of wolves, if the leader shows weakness of any kind, the others turn on him and tear him to pieces. These men are wolves. This is the world to which you have sent me. This is the world in which I live. I don't want it to be this way. I never wanted it to be this way. You were impatient, Kyla. I was young. When a man is young, he does things that when he is older, he regrets. You know, when I was a boy, all I ever wanted was your approval. So I did all sorts of things to try to gain it. You had it, in the beginning. Oh, I know that now. But I needed to know it then. Don't you understand? I'm trying to apologize. I've done terrible things, I know that. But can't you manage to forgive me? And then what? Take me with you. I'm still your son. Don't leave me here. Don't abandon me. I'm sorry. I can't do that. Can't, or won't? Either way it amounts to the same thing. Give me the code. No! Sooner or later, I'll find the boy. And when I do, I'll make it painfully clear to you that his grandfather's stubbornness is the reason his body is being tortured and broken. Sorry about hitting you earlier. What are you looking at? The stars. They are the only thing worth looking at here. You know, you know, you haven't said whether you're going to help us or not. Oh, you noticed that. The president-- Forget it. I know what you want and I'm not going. It's suicide. But if the insiders are as bad as you say, then you're his only chance. Except for one thing, it's not my problem. Well, you'll never forgive yourself if you just let them kill him. I will try to get over it somehow. What about the pardon? I never asked for one. You don't even know what I did. Doesn't matter. Oh, really? I was a doctor, did you know that? How could I? Next time, try asking. You know what your problem is, you've been hanging around politicians too long. You think you can just go up to someone and tell them what you want and convince them it's what they want. I don't have to listen to this. Really? What are your options? Well, I guess I should have known better than to try and reasonable with-- Murder. The crime was murder. Fine. We'll do it on our own. Good plan. I just wish you'd told me you wanted to kill yourself before I risked my life to save you. You go ahead and hide here then, but we're getting out. I am so sorry to keep you waiting, but I had other matters to attend to. But now, you have my complete attention. When the court condemned you to death, I should have given them my approval. But you didn't. You were unable to kill someone you loved. Another example of why I should rule and you should serve. I, on the other hand, have no such problems. But I'm faced with a dilemma, you see, I need the code. And you are the only one who knows it. I could torture you directly, but in your present condition, I might kill you before you told it to me, and then I'd be stuck on this miserable little planet forever. Which leaves me these two. And I pick-- eeney meeney mineymoe, catch a da-da-da-da-- you. You know, throughout the ages torture has always been a truly devastating weapon. It has taught men who is the master and who is the slave. When properly applied, it can destroy a man's body and his spirit. But this machine is special, state of the art. Want to see how it works? No. Sure you do. What's the code? I don't know. How do you like it? Anything to tell me yet? You know what, we've got all night. I don't know the code. Well, then tell me something you do know, something to make me stop. The boy, I can help you find him. How? It's CO2 for the standard search for a frequency. I don't know it, but I know which one. With any scanner, you could find him. You could find him. Well, now, this has been a productive session after all. Sorry, Mr. President. It's all right, son. Wherever he is, let's just hope he's safe. We leave in five minutes. You just keep your side of the deal. I'd rather not. I might hurt someone. That's the whole idea. Counting on you to take care of him while we're gone. When will you be back? As soon as we can. It's loaded. Hopefully, you won't have to use it. This will be your best friend if we don't make it. If we're not back in two days, we're not coming back. You understand? Let's go. When I get back, I'll show you how to use it. Cheer up, OK? We will be back. So why does a man trying to save lives turn to murder? He raped and killed my wife. She wouldn't have wanted me to do it, but at the time, I didn't care. He was the son of a provincial governor. I broke into the governor's mansion, crept out in the hall, and I killed him. No anger. I didn't say anything to him. Didn't make him beg. I just killed him. And then? I turned myself in. Some shortcut. What's wrong? Blisters. I bought these shoes for an imperial convention, not to be playing Tarzan in some bug infested jungle. It's going to get infected. I'm going to have to have it amputated. It ain't that bad yet. Shh. Ah. There's only a few of them. The rules of the outsiders is simple. For every 1 you see, there's 10 you don't. Their chief's name is Yor. Whatever happens, show no fear. If you show weakness, they will kill us all. Why does Tarkin trouble with demons from the sky? They are not demons, but great warriors. They have been sent to help in a battle against the insiders. If that is true, why does that one tremble with fear? He has heard of the coming of Sul. Ohh. Already can hear his footsteps. When will we hear this thing? You will hear the earth rumble and there will be fire in the sky. Is she the one we wait for? She is the one. Her hair is a gift of Sul. What's he saying? You're not the one, and he can prove it. Really? And just exactly how does he plan on doing that? My Cali translation is a little rusty, but it's something along the lines, like, feeding you to his knife. Ah. If there is to be a test, let it be me. Is this the way of the outsiders? Is this honor to be gained in fighting a woman? No, but in fightingher, there is no dishonor. For, if she's the one, Sul will protect her. If she's not, you will all die. What are you doing? It's all right. I know how to fight. You don't understand. No, you don't understand. I know how to fight. They think you're the chosen one. Yeah, thanks to you. So try not to bleed. Oh, OK. I'll try to keep that in mind. If you do bleed, they'll kill us all. What's he saying? You're nothing but a worthless woman. Not bad for a woman, huh? Now what? He's calling you a bitch. Should've kept the knife. Finish it. No. It's their way. I don't care. It's not my way. I look after children. I teach languages, geography, and rudimentary science. Butchering innocent people is not exactly on my resume. Devin, maybe you can make a small exception this time. You've shant. He needs to be tortured for you to witness and we'll be put to death. Why does she not kill him? She-- she-- She wishes for the boy to fight in the final battle for the glory of all, for the glory of-- of Sul! You're going to get us all killed. Is this true? Yes. This is the will of Sul! Go. We'll wait for your sign. You coming? I'm right behind you. How are we going to get in there? This whole place used to be a mining complex. The underground is riddled with tunnels and passages, most of which they don't even know about. You still sure you want to do this? All right. This way. Well, if you're going to do that, at least read it out loud. Today marks my second Christmas alone. And despite the ancient treaty, there's still not much peace on this earth, still less goodwill towards men. For that, we have Kyla to thank. What's the matter? That was my dad's name. I thought you said your father was dead. He is. Now what? What was that? Ahh, we have company. What is this place? This is where the final evacuations were staged. This is incredible. These must be the files on all the people who left Earth during the evacuation years. Must be millions of them. Shh. Where's he going? Well, well, well. Who do we have here. Now, equal. Walkie talkies. Now, I'll guide you through the complex from here. I'm not sure how accurate these still are. But just keep letting me know where you are and I'll try to guide you through. Keep safe, man. I'll be OK. After all, I got a gun. All right? In an age known for violence and depravity, somehow I've managed to make my mark. You don't approve. You've thrown them into the dark ages. I've returned them to the essence of what gives them strength. Look here, they know it, they feel it, and so do you, even if you can't admit it. What's going on? We're having a party, and you're both invited. How are you guys doing? MAN [OVER SPEAKER]: So far, so good. Let's hope so. OK. This is the last passage, other than going right through the front door. TARKIN [OVER SPEAKER]: We've come to a long passage. It appears empty. No surprises? No, no. It looks good to me. Let's go then. Oh, shit. Guys, gu-- guys, we have a problem. O'Shack, you care to be a little bit more specific about that? O'SHACK [OVER SPEAKER]: It looks like there may be some old security systems still down there. No, shit. Are you guys OK? Oh, yeah, never been better. And now for some real entertainment, our very own Bodo, and our two illustrious federal guests. What a life. It should be electrifying. What do we get if we win? Nothing. I hope they get back soon. Me, too. You're a good kid. Should make a good president some day. I think they're back. It's nothing. Ahh! Over there. I think that's him. Mr. President. Mr. President, it's us. Hello. I should have known. I see you've all met General Sentar, soon to become Warlord Sentar. That was the price of his betrayal, but he never told me about this. I wouldn't. I'll take care of you later. Why? Because I'm tired of weakness. I'm tired of weak men. And most of all, I'm tired of Bradford and his pathetic federation. Well, he still needs his medicine. I mean, he's no use to you dead. Medicine? You know what's in here, sweetie? Hypermidol. Not exactly. Nitrosyl. I'm impressed. An addictive degenerative poison. Trembling and the nausea your Bradford is feeling isn't from not getting this stuff, it's from getting too much. But it did convince another wise healthy man that he'd become weak and sickly. Hey, and now that the cat's out of the bag, a little withdrawal never hurt anyone. Take him away. Today is a day that will go down in history. We stand on the threshold of a dream. The day of our new beginning. The day when we reach out to take what is rightfully ours. The day we leave this place forever and reach for the stars. How are we going to do that? We don't got the code. You don't have the boy. We don't even have the ship. Wrong. Anyone else care to debate strategy and tactics? I have the boy. I have the locator wristband. And soon I will have the code. And as for the ship, he is the president of the federation. They're searching for him already, they just don't know where to find him. All we have to do is give them the coordinates. And one thing else remains, when Caesar took his legions to a new land, he burned his ships, telling his troops, you have one choice, to be victorious, or to perish. We will make that same decision today. Skull, show it to them. A cobalt salted thermonuclear device, a doomsday bomb, if you will. Once activated, it can never be stopped. When it goes off, it will destroy everything within 100 miles. Within a few short hours, the land around you will be a barren wasteland, devoid of life for 5,000 years. Consider this as we go forward. Now, who is with me! If I don't win, everybody looses. Let me ask you something. How lucky can one man be? Yesterday I was all alone. Today I have my son, my father, a beautiful woman. Best of all, my old friend Tarkin. Life is full of irony. For six years we searched fo ryou, struggled to find you. And then at the last possible moment, before I'm forced to abandon the chase forever, you show up here. I'd kill you myself, but that would disappoint the men. After all, you've killed so many of them. So I'm going to let this be a gift to them. I need a volunteer. You, and you, and you. For your information, that little toy he's holding is called a fang stick, rather appropriately named. The purpose of the blade is fairly obvious. But that innocent looking stub on the other end contains a single 10 gauge shotgun shell, make contact, and-- well, you'll see. And what do I get? Our sincere best wishes. Let the games begin! Why are you doing this? Because I'm the daddy. Come on. Come on, babe. Try it. Maybe this time you'll get it. Come on. Try it again, please. Come on, babe. Try it. Try it again. Come on, baby. Try it. Give it a try. Huh. Come and get it. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Give me the key. No, you have to take it. I said, give me the key. Why? Are you going to kill me? Have you ever done it, killed a man, spread his guts all over the floor, and watch him die? Nope. Come on. There. What do we do when we get there? Try for some kind of a diversion and then we look for a chance to get Bradford out of there. Just hope this works. Come on, Tarkin, you can do it. Shut up. Come on! Get up! No. Noble. Foolish, but noble. And now, for the moment of truth. The boy first. No! All right. I'll give you the code. Somehow I knew you'd say that. Damn you. WOMAN [VOICEOVER]: Enter security access code. Now, if you would be so kind. one, alpha, six, William, seven, zulu. Keyword, Tasker. WOMAN [VOICEOVER]: Systems accessed. Location locked. Rescue ship dispatch. They think of everything, don't they? Come on! Come on! Meet me by the last hour on the far side of the colony. What are you going to do? I've got a score to settle. Something I should have done a long time ago. Let's go. We can't stay here long. The ship will be here any minute-- oh, no. Kyla's got my locator. The ship will be searching for him. Hey, good boy, Dan. Good boy. Well, what about Tarkin? Don't worry. I have a feeling we'll be seeing him again. Put it down. We really don't have time for this. We got to get out of here. We can't leave him. But, Danny-- Daniel. Daniel. Come on. The man who brings me his head gets to live. Going somewhere? Yeah. And where I'm going, you're not coming. Because you're going to hell. You know, before I go, I think I've got to kill you. It's like one of those things, if you don't do it, you look back on it, and say, why didn't I do that? Try to die. Don't. Now, how many times has daddy told you not to play with guns? You're not my father. Really? You wouldn't hurt daddy, would you? See? I told you, you wouldn't hurt daddy. No, but I will. Mr. President, you forgot something. Sentar, you traitor. Out of my way, O'Shack. O'Shack, O'Shack. Sleep, my friend. Sleep. I'm granting you a full pardon. You have my word. I'm not sure if I can accept that. I meant what I did. I can understand that. But I want to thank you both for saving Daniel's life. Here you go. Now, if you'll excuse me. So you're a free man now. How does it feel? Good. It feels good. So what now? I don't know. I never thought about it. Well, you might want to think about Saiginus 4. Why there? Oh, I don't know, nice climate. I'm sure they could always use another doctor. And that's where I'll be.
