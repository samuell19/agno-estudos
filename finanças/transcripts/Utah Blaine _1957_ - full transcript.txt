This is far enough. Easy now. He falls off, it'll be all over. A broken neck ain't gonna get you out of this fast, Neal. Hurry it up, Lud. It'll be light soon. It's a long way back. You'll get yours, Lud. You'll get what's coming to you. Ain't nothing coming to me, Joe, except a large hunk of the 46-Connected. Have a nice trip, Joe. Wh-who do I-- I have to th-thank? Only reason you're alive is they wanted to hang you slow. Yeah. No horse? I'm walking. In this county? Yeah. You can tell me who you are when you're ready. Ha. Bet I'm 2 inches taller now. What did they have against you? My land. The best land in the valley. All of 'em trying to get it like a... pack of wolves. The 46-Connected Ranch. Ever hear of it? No. Been on it more than 30 years. Fought the Indians for it then. Trouble is none of the land around here has ever been filed. Now all the little guys want to get big quick by...killing me and taking over what's mine. They've already killed one big rancher. Gid Blake. You know how they got away with it? How? By calling themselves Vigilantes. They make themselves the law... and there's no law to hold 'em in check. It's Russ Nevers. He's the one. He's the only one with brains enough to organize 'em and make killers out of 'em. Well, if you go back, you're a dead man. Well, what am I gonna do? Just give it all up, just like that? There's more than 30,000 head of cattle on the 46. I-- I've told you a lot, friend. I'm Utah Blaine. What are you giving me? Utah Blaine is in old Mexico, mixed in that revolution, I heard. I crossed the border a week ago. Like that? Yeah, like this. I was supposed to face a firing squad down there. Only the jail didn't hold together long enough. Want a job? I got a job. I'll pay you more. This job doesn't pay any money. Huh. Working for nothing? You didn't make that much money in Mexico. Fellow that sold me out did. You're hunting somebody. You ever heard the name... Rink Witter? Rink Witter was with that bunch that tried to string me up tonight. What's your town? Red Creek. Over the ridge. Play along with me and you can have Rink. He's a gun-hand for Russ Nevers. What's the deal? Go back to Red Creek as manager for the 46. You'll get a hundred a month and an outfit, plus $1000 expense money. Clear this up, you get 1000 head of cattle to start your own spread or sell. Can you walk? We can't stay here. Sure. Railroad crosses the mountains about six miles back. We can reach El Paso and draw the papers up proper. One thing more: you'll need information. See a man named Ben Kinyon. He's a friend of mine from the old Indian days. Don't do anything till you see him. Remember the name. Ben Kinyon. I'll remember it. I'm looking for a man named Ben Kinyon. Where do I find him? You'd better hurry. Over that way, beyond the church. Thanks. I've seen him before. I've seen him before someplace. Which one of you is Ben Kinyon? What did you want with Ben Kinyon? If he's here, I'll talk to him. Yesterday, you could have talked to him. Not now. That his grave? I don't know you, mister. Leave me alone. Maybe there's an excuse for you not knowing she's Ben's daughter. Now you know, go away. Joe Neal didn't tell me Kinyon had a daughter. You said Joe Neal. You're lying. Joe Neal is dead. Killed like my father. Didn't I tell you to clear out? A funeral ain't no place for trouble, mister. What happened to Ben Kinyon? Ambushed, out on 46 land. Never had a chance. Now will you go. What about Joe Neal? Well, I'll tell you this much. He's alive. The rest I'd better tell to you, nobody else. You didn't say who you are. That's right. I didn't. Tom... get my horse. Angie, you're not riding out of here with any stranger. You're coming with me to the B-Bar, and we'll-- Thanks, Mary. I'll talk with him. Mister, I warn you... if anything happens to her... You think the way things are in this valley, those will do any good? He's looking for trouble, sure enough. It was Alta. That's where it was. I remember now. Man, what's Utah Blaine doing here? Utah Blaine? Yeah. More than a thousand miners are raising holy Ned. Alta was a hole, a real stinking hole, till they called him in. Yeah, that's where it was. Alta. When he had his guns tied down. Looks like you're gonna see it again too. You tie 'em down like a professional gunslinger. That just for show? Coming? Angie, you can't go with him. We'll be at my place. How much further is this place of yours? Far end of the 46 range. Another three miles. They're watching us. They're wondering who you are. Wondering who'd dare take up with Ben Kinyon's daughter. Think they'd shoot you? I don't know. Well, don't stop till you get to your place. Is this the boundary of the 46? Well, north boundary. Why? Anybody riding up is on Joe Neal's land. First, no one's taking the 46 away from Joe Neal. He made me manager to see to it. You out of your mind? You expect to hold out against Russ Nevers and his bunch all by yourself? That's what he's paying me for. Who in blue blazes are you? Blaine. Mike Blaine. Up at Alta, they started calling me Utah. I was right. A professional gunslinger. I want nothing to do with you, mister. Get out. I was expecting help from your father. Now it has to be you. A professional gunman killed my father. Rink Witter? How did you know that? Can you prove it? No. Who are the Vigilantes? Nevers heads 'em up. Then there's Clell Miller, Lud Fuller...Farragut... Oh, about eight or 10 others. Miller's the foreman at the B-Bar. That's, uh, Gid Blake's place? Yeah, that was Gid Blake's daughter you met at the cemetery. What about her? They all want the 46. Maybe even Mary Blake. I don't know. They say Joe Neal's dead. How would you know different? I left him in El Paso where he signed the papers making me manager. Russ Nevers. See what they want. What do you want? Somebody rode out here, Angie, with you. Where is he? You come out just to say hello? No. We come out just to have you vacate 46 land. Now we gave you and your old man fair warning. And if I don't... I'll be killed like he was? The 46 is gonna be split up, Angie. There ain't no longer any room for you. So you better start packing your things now. We'll wait. Stage out of town at 4:30, and you gonna be on it. I don't see Rink Witter. Well, now, maybe that's 'cause he ain't here. Who are you? Just tell Rink that Utah Blaine is here. And this is your fair warning. Stay off this range. You must have a right to give that kind of order, son. Yeah. I'm the new manager. I'm riding into town tomorrow morning to file my papers at the bank. They're signed legal by Joe Neal. For your information, Joe Neal is dead. And if you got any papers, they're forged. And we don't like forgers. Now, do I make myself clear? Ha! Ha! Anybody else? I heard Rink Witter talking. He says he's faster than you are. We'll find out. Yeah. We'll find out. In the meanwhile, get off of 46 range and stay off. And another thing: Copies of my papers have been sent to the capital. If the governor isn't too busy, there'll be an investigation. Now get them out of here. Clell... He's dead. Give me a hand, Fuller. Blaine, there ain't a hand left on the 46. Just thought you ought to know that. You're all alone. They'll be back. They won't bother you as long as they think my papers are in the capital. Think your papers are in the capital? Wouldn't have done any good to register 'em. But it'll bluff Nevers for a while... and give us some time. They'll stop you somehow. They'll never let you get to that bank in the morning. I wish I could say there were a lot of decent people around here you're fighting for. But I can't. They're all land-hungry. They're all greedy. All you can do is teach 'em a lesson. Or get yourself killed. Not much to offer a man who gets paid for using his guns. It's no different anyplace. Everybody wants what he hasn't got. But it'll change. People will have to live by the rules. That won't bring my father back. It's lonely out where he is. It's even lonelier being alive. You go back to the 46 tonight, they could murder you in your bed. There's nobody there to back you up. You're welcome to use my father's room for tonight. I could spell you while you get some rest. Well, thank you. First, I'd like to check Joe's inventory on the ledgers. He said your father kept the books. Yeah, uh, Father used to do a lot of figuring for Joe. You insisting on trying to reach that bank in the morning? Well, I have to let 'em know sooner or later who's running the 46. Well, the ledgers are in the basement. I'll get 'em whenever you want. Well, right now. Something's scaring the horses. Oh, I'll go out and look around. Oh, no. I've been doing this since I was 8 years old. You stay. I know the layout. It's probably the big cat that's been raiding down out of the hills the last couple of weeks. All right. Don't make any noise. I don't wanna hurt you. No noise. No noise at all. There now. Yeah, that's fine. What do you want here? Nevers told me about Blaine. Only Blaine wasn't at the 46. You expect him to sit there waiting while you come to ambush him? He's hunting me. But, you see, I like to do the hunting! Now, I'll find him. I'll give him his chance. Then I kill him. You don't intend to give him a chance. That's why you're hunting him at night. I've an idea he's in your place. Now, you give him any kind of a warning, Angie...I'll kill you. Something to laugh about? I can just see Angie Kinyon letting a strange man stay in her cabin all night. Well, now, maybe he ain't there... But then again, maybe you're lying, huh? Are you? Go up on the knoll! You can look down on the cabin and see for yourself. We'll both go up on the knoll. All right? You wanna go down closer and look? If Blaine's there... maybe he'll see you first. You see Blaine... you tell him Rink Witter's hunting him. You tell him that. It's certain Rink Witter will be in Red Creek waiting for you in the morning. How do you know that? If he hadn't scared the horses, he would've killed you tonight. Shot you through the window, I guess. Where'd you go? Well, after you went outside and the horses still acted up, I knew it wasn't a cat. Cat would've taken off. So I went outside to see. I saw you up on the knoll. I thought you were up there with a friend. Yeah, I wanted him up on that knoll... with the moon in back of him. If I could've warned you, you would've had a clear shot. You can't fight 'em all in town tomorrow. Nevers might send Rink after me at night, but not in town in the daylight. Well, I hope you're right. I hope you come back. I'll come back. I said for you kids to get off the street. I thought Blaine was coming to the bank this morning. Where is he? He'll be here. Now let me worry about that. You didn't get Blaine last night. All right. But I don't wanna see you getting gun crazy now. We're gonna do things the way I got 'em set up. You understand? You know, Blaine's outsmarting you. Governor ain't gonna horn in down here. No? Well, maybe not. But I'm paying for your guns, and I want you to leave 'em right where they are unless I tell you to use 'em. How you feeling, Gus? I don't like it, Nevers. I never set out to kill a man in my life. No? Well, there's two men that died by your fists that I know of. No, that was different. I didn't set out to do it. You don't wanna stay working in that dry goods store all your life, do you? You want some of that 46 land, don't you? Well, all you have to do is to keep Blaine from getting into the bank. Hey, Nevers... he's coming. All right, Gus. Don't even know the man. Got no right to kill him. Blaine? I'm Blaine. My name's Ortmann. I run the dry goods store. I don't mean nothing against you. Just I can't let you go no further. Nevers send you out here? I ask you peaceful. Go aways. Stay out of Red Creek. You know what they want, Ortmann? They want an excuse. They want me to gun you so they can kill me for shooting an unarmed man. What you gonna do? Conduct a little business at the bank. Blaine, I can't let you! Then stop me. You gonna fight me? It's up to you. I can't let--! Get him. A shotgun can cover a lot of territory. Anybody want me to prove it? Coker, your life ain't gonna be worth one red cent around here. In that case, maybe you fellas better just chuck your guns out in the middle of the road. Chuck 'em! Do what you have to, Utah. You haven't backed me up like this since Alta, three years ago. You must like the rough end. Matilda here kind of evens things up. Hello, Rink. Keep going, Coker. You can go clear to California. I couldn't stop you. Just don't try changing your mind. All right, fellas. Just relax... and our little visit will be practically painless. I just filed my papers with the bank. I'm running the 46 for Joe Neal. All trails crossing the 46 are closed... as of now. How'd you get out of that Mexican jail, Utah? I just told 'em I wanted to kill you. They let me out. Pick up your gun. Think I'm crazy? Soon as I kill you, Coker cuts loose with that shotgun. Some other time, amigo. All right? Pick 'em up! You ready? Where are we going? Could be anyplace. That's one place I never been. I'll be with you. Blaine? I'm glad you beat me. I don't want any part of Nevers and his gunslingers. I'll get mine without having blood on my hands. I'm going with you. Get your horse. Well, boys, I'll have to admit, I didn't figure on Coker doing what he did. But we're still a bunch of knotheads to let Blaine get in that bank and get out of town. Well, he still can't hold the 46 with only Ortmann and Coker to help him. Well, you don't think he's stupid enough to try, do you? Blaine's not the kind of man to go out there and sit still while we nail him. Lud, you take six or seven good men and go after Blaine. And don't come back here without his hide. And remember... you messed up hanging Joe Neal. Now don't mess up bringing in Blaine. You can't take over anything as long as Neal's alive. Well, don't you think I know that? By the time we're ready for him, he won't be alive. Rink, that's your job. How am I gonna find him? -Neal could be anywhere. -That's right. But Blaine's papers in there are gonna tell us where Joe Neal had 'em drawn up. And that'll give us a pretty good place to start. -You're hurt. Oh, -I'm all right. -Papers are at the bank. -Oh, good. I didn't expect company. They think Joe Neal has a right to keep his land. Mary Blake too. Nevers is gonna take the 46 and the B-Bar. Well, I kinda expected that. You're riding with Utah? Yeah. Then it's like you said it would be. You're on the run. They'll be after us as soon as they're ready. Well, come on inside, I got some food ready. I only brought up enough food for Utah. Why don't you go down and get what you need? Thanks, Angie. You can't keep running from Nevers. He'll be seeing me. I'm glad Coker and Gus will be with you. It's going to be lonely staying here alone. I knew what it'd be like this morning... the minute you left for town. We'll need you, Angie. We may be out for weeks. We'll need supplies, ammunition. You're the only one we can count on to get the stuff. I'll be here if you need me. Look, I know this is, uh... nothing for a woman to be mixed up in. But that's the way it happened. I wish you could be out of it. Well...here's half a ham. Some bacon. Thank you. Blaine's tracks lead here. They lead away too. You'd see 'em if you had any eyes in your head. Look around! What good's Blaine gonna do you, running the way he is? If you're crazy, you'll get close enough to ask him. They lead this way! Come on! We bedding down this close? No. But I want 'em to follow us this far before they have to stop, because they can't find our tracks at night. Well, where will we be? Doubling back to the B-Bar. -The B-Bar? -Yeah. We'll split up here and go out in three different directions. We'll meet at Tule Mesa. That'll give 'em something to think about when they try and pick up our trail in the morning. -Okay? -Yeah. The lights are out. They must be asleep. Rip, you take the bunkhouse. Gus, you take the corral. All right? Yeah. Don't scream. I want to talk to you. Get dressed. You're leaving the B-Bar. What? Nevers and your foreman are in this together. Oh. Look, Blaine, I-- Every second you waste could mean a couple of good men getting shot. Now, get up. With you here? Yeah, with me here. Hey! Hee-yah! Hup! Hee-yah! Get out of here! Hey! Come on. Utah, what--? I'll tell you inside. Keep watch, will you? I don't know any more about this than you. As long as you're alive, they can't take the B-Bar away from you. You said something about Clell Miller, my foreman. He was tied in with Nevers. You were next on their list. With you safe someplace and me still around, Nevers can't make any kind of a move that'd give him permanent possession of the two ranges. Coker? Nothing yet. You're getting out of the territory. Angie, the train stops at the water tower at the top of the ridge. Get Miss Blake there. She can board it. It's the one chance you've got. Blaine, if you can hang on to the B-Bar for me, I'll have a lot to thank you for. Nevers is gonna have to spread his boys out pretty thin to hold the B-Bar. That's thanks enough for me. Lud Fuller was here. He's on your trail with five other men. Know any of them? Yeah. Three are hired gunmen brought in by Rink. I'll know what to look for. Take care. You two are getting along fine. I'll get dressed. You have to make that train. We've been in the saddle nine hours. When are we gonna bed down? That's what Blaine wants us to do. These horses will cave in. You know that. Sure, I know it. So does Blaine. His horses are gonna be just as tired as ours. Look, it'll mean a little extra riding. But it'll give us a chance to drop in on Blaine unexpected-like. Well, so far, you're giving the orders. We'll follow these tracks another hour. That wasn't aimed at us. Well, they can't be very far from here. Get rid of your gear. Everything. Just hold onto your guns. That'll lighten us up enough to catch up with 'em. They went off over here! You two stay here and watch our stuff. Come on. A shotgun could get both of you at once. Real easy. Where'd you two come from? Your tracks lead out of here. Rip, get their grub. Drop those gun belts. Back up by the river. Come on, back up. See you around, boys. Yah! Yah! This is as far as I go without grub. Johnson, Merrick, and me hired our guns out to-- Do you want to get paid? Well, Nevers will pay off for Blaine's hide and nothing else. What difference does it make if Blaine's alive or dead, so long as Rink gets Joe Neal. You want to turn back? All right, go ahead. I got my orders the same as you. Have some ham, boys. We got plenty to spare. All right, boys. Drop your guns. Just so everything stays nice and friendly. You fellows must be plenty tired. We've been following you for the last three miles without you knowing. You said Rink went after Joe Neal. By this time, Neal's probably dead, Blaine. Where does that leave you? Neal's no fool. Rink won't find him. Well, if he does, there'll be no heirs to the 46. And it'll be open land for legal claims. Your papers won't mean a thing. Besides, you're gonna have to answer for killing some honest citizens. Only one man besides myself knows where Joe Neal is. Fuller, you and your men are gonna ride into Red Creek with us. Red Creek?! Are you trying to commit suicide? If I didn't need you, Fuller, I'd hang you now. The same as you tried to hang Joe Neal. Slow. The only way you could know that would be if you was there. Yeah. That's the only way. Now let's go. Hold it. What happened between you and Nevers? What happened? You showed Nevers my papers so he could find Joe Neal. No. Blaine, please. Listen to me. If Joe Neal is dead, you helped kill him. No, no. No, no. I didn't! I didn't! Nevers held a gun at my head! Wh--what could I do? Rink, my boy, I knew you'd do it. I knew I could depend on you. You should've seen Joe Neal's face when he saw me! I'll bet! He turned green! He looked like he was gonna die all by himself! Well, boys, tomorrow we'll be the proud owners of the 46-Connected. And that's the finest range in this territory. That fool Ortmann! Could've got himself a few acres! Nevers! It's Blaine! He's here! Utah, they got Gus! You shot Fuller. He came right at me. How'd I know? How did you know? Well, boys, that makes one man less to split the land with. Maybe you'd like the rest of us to get it like that too, so as you could wind up with all the 46, huh? Would you like that, Nevers? Don't be an idiot. You shot Fuller. I didn't. Davis, see if he's still alive. If he is, call the doc. Ortmann was hit, wasn't he? That only leaves Blaine and Coker. We ought to be celebrating, not arguing. Who's arguing? Well, that's better. That's more like it. 'Cause tomorrow we're gonna do this thing up nice and legal. We'll send the Vigilantes out there after Blaine. They'll get him, they'll hang him. 'Cause he killed some of our people, and he's a murderer. And that means that you're not even gonna have to try to draw against him. All right, folks. It's all over. There's no more shooting. Let's all get back in the bar, and Russ Nevers will buy the drinks. That's right, Nevers. You buy 'em all drinks. You might get to need some friends. UTAH: Gus, you can't ride much further. You'd better go on without me. They figure they got us now. No sense chasing us. We'll get you to Angie's. There was a slip-up. Gus was shot. No other place we could take him. There's a spare cot in the basement. They might not look for him there. Come on. Careful of the steps. Get that lamp, will you? Maybe I can get doc out of town in the morning without anybody seeing us leave. He's gonna need a doctor, Utah. You wouldn't have a chance, Angie. The whole town is full of Nevers' men, all celebrating Joe Neal's death. Then Neal is dead? Rink Witter found him. Then it's over. Oh, there's nothing to back you up now. Nothing. Utah, quit, please. The land doesn't mean that much. Not anymore. You couldn't stay here either. I'll go with you. Rink Witter killed your father. You willing to forget that? You'd never rest. Bandage him up, will you? What can you do now? I don't know. With Joe dead, everything's mixed up. I thought I had it all figured out. Hit Nevers wherever I could. Drive him out of the valley. You think that by still fighting you can get that thousand head of cattle? That's something I've wanted all my life. I'm willing to earn it. My father thought about things the same way you do. He and I got along together just fine. All right, Utah. Whatever you want. If it don't fester up, he'll be all right. Take care of him, Angie. We'd better move along. Yeah. And if I have to see you? Well, we'll stay put for a while, till we figure out something. Best place would be at Big Rock, on Hammerclaw Ridge. That's where we'll be. Tom? Miss Blake. You shouldn't have come back here. I have to get to Angie Kinyon's place. I've got a buckboard out back. You haven't seen me. Your father trusted me. You can too. Alta was different. With the mines booming, it was a case of men going crazy with too much money. Here they're going crazy because they want money so bad. This is worse. Whole town's scared-- Scared clean through the marrow. Maybe they got a right to be scared. Think they've got a right to stand by and watch men like Joe Neal and Gid Blake get murdered for what belongs to 'em? I don't know, Utah. If I could answer things like that, I'd be sitting on a million dollars and getting drunk every night of the week. Is Gus all right? Oh, he's burning up with fever. That's not why I came. Mary Blake's at my place. Is that woman crazy? Anybody know she's here? No. She had to come back, Utah. She was in El Paso when Joe Neal was shot by Rink. You told me she was going to Salt Lake. She had things to talk over with Neal. She was too late. Utah... she brought back news. You own half the 46 now. I own the other half. What are you talking about? Oh, Mary saw Joe's lawyer. There was a will filed in El Paso. I was only doing a job for him. Why me? Mary said why. If anything happened to Joe... he wanted a man on the 46 who'd already lost the itch in his feet. A man who was ready to stay with the 46 as long as the land needs him. Joe could see things fast. I couldn't. I thought there'd always be a day... when you'd have to take off again. It'll be dark in an hour, Angie. You'd better be getting back. Come back with me. Mary has some things to say. She knows you feel the same way Joe Neal did about the people here. She thinks you're wrong. Well...we'll listen to what she has to say. I'll put out the fire. All right. The papers are filed in El Paso. Legal. You're another big ranch owner now, Blaine, not just a manager for Joe Neal. You hate the guts of every human being in Red Creek. You don't? I was born here. I know which ones can be decent if we give 'em the opportunity. You've been fighting alone up until now, Blaine. You've done more than can rightly be expected of any man. I'm obliged to you. And so are some of the people in Red Creek. But now the 46 is yours and Angie's. Nevers will try harder than before to kill you. Only if he knows about the will. Mary can tell you the ones who can be trusted. Gus needs a doctor. Tell Tom Cory. He can get to Doc Harrison's place. Gus, if you trust the wrong one, you could be found here and shot. I've never learned to be a lone wolf like you, Utah. I've learned to trust people. Okay, Gus. Somebody's coming. Riders coming. You better put the horses in the barn. Trouble? Get out in the back with Rip and stay there. Can you get down the stairs by yourself? Sure. We'll be right out front. What are you gonna do when all the excitement's over? You think I like this kind? Any kind. I knew if we talked long enough, we'd find something we both liked. I won't be long. You always leave your door unlocked? If it was locked, would that stop you from coming in? Always got the right answers. Mind if I look through the house? Someday, you'll be unlucky enough to find Blaine here. Where is he? If you mean Blaine... I haven't seen him in weeks. Then that means he's starving to death. Don't it? You've been getting him food. You know where he is. You're guessing. No man can live in those hills without help, and he can't get the help anyplace except from you. You're still guessing. There's seven men outside... all sworn in as Vigilantes. We're the law! We never hung a woman before... but I don't think it takes any different kind of a rope. You know what the people in town would do to you? You gonna tell me? I don't know! All women like to talk, Angie. Why do you have to be different? I can't tell you what I don't know! It was Gus! They shot Gus! He knew I was in trouble, and he tried to shoot Rink. The poor, big moose. If he couldn't use his fists, he was beat. He should've known. I'm going into town and see Tom Cory. No, not now. Not after what just happened. You said your friends would fight. All right, they'll get their bellyful of it. Rip, you stay here till I get back. Yeah. Rip, stop him! No. Gus was his friend, Angie. Quiet! Blaine. Tom, I just came from Mary Blake. Is she all right? I don't know for how long. She's the only one who stands in Nevers' way. Well, you and her. Rink Witter killed Ortmann tonight. Why, that sneaking, yellow-livered killer. You know what's gonna happen if I'm stopped. Mary's killed, and Nevers gets control of the 46 and the B-Bar. Well, some of us know. Nevers will take control of everything. We'll have to kiss the ground he walks on just for a handout. And even if we get rid of Nevers... there'll be more just like him coming along. There's only one way you can stop 'em. You got to elect a mayor, a city council and a marshal. Will you tell your friends that? I'll tell 'em. And Ray Forbes will help me. Forbes? The newspaper man. Oh, yeah. All right, tell them this. There'll be a meeting at Angie's tomorrow night. And make sure they know why. I guess you know we're all scared here, don't you? Well...maybe we'll get over it now. Keep off the street when you go. Right. I know, but it's only a question of time. Yeah. We'll just have to wait-- Anybody here that shouldn't be? No. Forbes and Cory are late. Blaine...it's all over town now. Forbes here was in the saloon when it happened. Jug Davis let it slip. Nevers is going to start a round-up of the B-Bar stock in the morning. Then he's going to sell the cattle and split the money amongst his boys. Davis was celebrating already. It's piracy. Sheer piracy. Come on in. Men, I had a lot of words to speak to you about what you can do to run your town. But it's too late for that now. Russ Nevers is having a round-up on the B-Bar tomorrow morning. And then he's taking the cattle to market. He can't be that crazy. He knows i'm alive, and I can protect my brand legally. Of course, of course. They found Joe Neal, they figure they can find you. Blaine, this is the very height of things that Nevers has done. He can only have Mary Blake's murder in mind. And he isn't even trying to make it look legal with his confounded Vigilantes. I came out here knowing I'd have to face a showdown. I don't have to wait. I'm ready for it now. How many of you feel that way? Now it's the women, next it's our kids. How do we know? How do we know what they'll do? That's right. Blaine, you name it. Well, Nevers will move against us, that's for sure. Can you set up your newspaper the way I want it and have it out the first thing tomorrow morning? By working all night. Fine. Then maybe we can get Nevers to move the way we want him to. Nevers should be right out. Maybe we should let him sleep. Maybe he's having dreams of owning the whole world. Not just the B-Bar and the 46. He don't own anything. Soon as we finish this roundup, we're taking our share. That's just what I-- Hey, Rink. Morning, boys. Davis! Anything wrong? Ain't gonna be a roundup. This came out early this morning. It's all over town. Now, look here, Nevers. We've worked too hard and too long for this. Now we're going into town. Maybe we'll hire out as new hands at the Indianhead Corral. All right, boys, we're going in. Think Nevers will show up? We'll know soon enough. It'd take him this long to get here from the B-Bar. It's quarter to 10. Tell the boys, will you? Is this it? Pass it along. All right, let's get 'em off the street. Off the street, Mrs. Denker. Move fast now. Take the kids. Everybody... off the street. Off the street! There might be some trouble. Don't want anyone to get hurt. Everybody, find cover! Let's hope Mary and Angie stay put at Tom's place. Gonna seem like a long wait. Second time I've done that in the last five minutes. This is one bluff we're gonna have to make work. Horses. Nevers, where's everybody? I don't know. Something's wrong. I don't like it a bit. There's your friend over there. Get busy with that pencil. Hello, Rink. I was wondering if you wanted to come in and go to work for me. Could be, Blaine. Could be. Where is everybody? They leave town? Can't tell. Glad you rode in, though, Nevers. Kinda wanted you and your men to leave the 46 and the B-Bar so we could put our men on. You what? Why, sure. Circulated the papers last night in Marvin Springs. Got us 50 new men this morning. They're out on the ranches now, in case you're thinking of riding back. Rip's just figuring up things. You're lying. Could be I am. Won't do you any good. You're not getting out of Red Creek. You're boxed in, Nevers. Call 'em off, Coker! Call 'em off! All right, drop your guns and off your horses! Hey. Oh, Utah! Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. I want to-- I want to go out and see what a town looks like when it grows up. That's what this town's had: growing pains. Now what are you gonna do for excitement?
