[♪♪♪] [Jenny]: Yeah. I know. So what do you think you're going to get him? Oh, I don't know... -Whoa! -Oh, I'm sorry! Do you want some help with these? No, I've got it. Thanks. [P.A.]: Paging Dr. Benson to O.R. 2. Dr. Benson to O.R. 2. [♪♪♪] Have a great day. You, too. Who is that guy? Um, I don't know. He is awfully good-looking. Okay, let's get a move on. We don't want to miss this. Wow! Amazing tree! That is fantastic. [Jenny]: And so real-looking! [Walt]: I know! It's a thing of beauty. We should have bought one of these years ago. Wait'll we get those grab-bag presents under it. Morning! [Walt]: These are beautiful! Did you pick them out this morning? Yeah. 'Tis the season! Alice is waiting for us. We've got a family. Sorry. Thanks. All right. Let's do it, team. [Jenny]: Hi, guys! Oh, perfect timing. Alice just went to get her. [Lauren]: Oh, well... bet you guys're glad to see the last of this place. Yeah. Actually, I think we're going to miss you all. We're glad we're going to have to. They're coming! Well, Emma put up a little bit of a fight, but I think I convinced her that she's going to be happier in a comfy crib at home than in that old incubator. You know, I... there was a time I thought this day would never come. I knew it would... because we're here. It's a miracle. We're looking at the miracle. Well, we know that you are anxious to get her home. On glorious days like this, when our work is done, we have a special custom. Ready? Dear little angel, we bid you adieu. Go spread your sweet wings and fly. We're sorry we kept you with us so long, but so thrilled to be saying "goodbye..." and though you are leaving, you won't be forgotten. We'll never be truly apart. So dear little angel... we love you so much, and each precious beat of your heart. Now you take your baby home. Yeah. Thank you. Bye! This never gets old. How could it? Oh, I printed out that budget for you. Oh, bring it on. Are you sure that you really want to do this? Absolutely. I love a good party. Well, going to a party and planning a party are two very different things. Well, I was on my senior prom committee, and we covered the entire ceiling of the gym in twinkle lights, so... I think planning a party for a few nurses is going to be a little easier. Oh, I cannot believe that it's almost Christmas again. I know, it's only three weeks away. And I have not gotten anything for my nieces. How about Mr. Dudley? [Alice]: Oh, he's got his squeeze toys and his liver treats, and they're already wrapped. Good mama. That's the same budget as every year, but you still have to get it approved. It's just a formality. Okay. I'm on it. Thank you, and good luck. [Jenny]: See ya. [knocks] The flower girl. Sir Galahad. Ha! Hardly. Uh, yeah, well, and I haven't been a flower girl since my aunt's wedding, and I was four. Hi. Matt Crawford. Jenny Miller. Um... no more Mr. Brockman? No, no. He got tired of CFO-ing, so I'm the new guy. Are you here on official business? Yes, I am. Here, have a seat. You know, you can look up all this up on the Internet now. Yeah, but where's the fun in that? I'm an old-fashioned guy. I have yet to read an e-book. Wow. Yeah. All right, what've you got? I just need this approved. Christmas party... "nigh-kew?" "Nick-U." It's the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Sorry. I'm still brushing up on the hospital business. -I've got a lot to learn. -'Kay. What? Uh, well, I don't really see the hospital as a business. Oh, but it is. You know what? It's just kind of a formality. Uh-huh. It's the same every year. Yeah, I got it. Here's the thing, Jenny. There's a new policy at the hospital, so all non-essential expenditures... "Non-essential"? Yeah... is being reduced by 25%. A Christmas party for some hard-working nurses is hardly "non-essential." Well, I mean, compared to paying the electric bill or keeping us stocked with cotton gauze, it is. We don't use cotton gauze anymore. It's a polyblend. Like I said, a lot to learn. I just don't think I can pull off a party for that little. Sure you can. "Creativity" is your middle name. You just met me. I'm a keen judge of character. So, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to reduce your bottom line by 25%, initial there... Voila! Your new budget's approved. I'll just make you a copy. So you were able to calculate that in your head, hey? Yeah. I'm a numbers guy. No kidding. Ah, here we go. Thank you. So if you need any help, you know... cutting costs... I'm your guy. Sure thing. It's nice to meet you, Jenny Miller. Thank you! [Matt]: Jenny Miller... [Kate]: Thank you so much for coming to help me. Are you kidding, Mom? It's my favorite Christmas tradition. I thought staying up late for Santa was. [laughs] Maybe when I was little. Okay, fine, it's my second favorite. How's it going, guys? We've changed our minds. We're making fruitcake instead of Christmas cookies. That's not funny. No, Bob, it's, um... we're serious. I repeat. We'll let you know when the cookies are ready. I could help you. Get out of here! Okay, okay, take it easy. Let me know the minute they're ready so I can make sure-- "Make sure they came out all right." I need your help. Sure. It's Bob's and my 30th Christmas together. Mom, that's fantastic. I want to get him something special to let him know how much these 30 years have meant, but I just don't know what that something special is, and he's impossible to shop for. I know. It's 'cause he stopped wearing ties. You're his stepdaughter. You could bring some fresh perspective to this. Do you want me to come shopping with you? Would you? Yes, of course! In what universe would I not? Thank you. Wow, 30 years, hey? You sound surprised. Mm... You guys are so different. You know, you like tennis, he likes golf. You could hike for days. He can hike for an hour, tops, and those delicious mushrooms you put in your risotto, he picks them out... and beets! You cannot get the man to eat beets. Well, opposites attract, and we're in sync where it counts... especially our love for Christmas cookies. Mom, I don't know anybody who doesn't love your Christmas cookies. [♪♪♪] [children chattering, laughing] [Matt]: Hey! Hey! Wow. Someone has a Santa complex. Blame the toy store. Too many choices, too much time. Where do you want these? Pile 'em here. [laughs] Well, I don't know. It seems like somebody may be overcompensating for, like, a guilty conscience. My big sister... the psychoanalyst. How's the new job going? It's fine. Making any of those tough decisions yet? Starting to. Like I said... compensation. [train whistle tooting] Hey, Matt. Hey, Eric! Where in the world did you get that? From a North Pole theme park that went belly up. Why in the world did you get that? To give the kids a spin around the lot out front. And to drive it around town, you know, advertise the place the little. It's actually a good idea. It was Isabel's. All the good ideas are. This guy... astute. You've trained him well. My friend, Lucy, is going to be in town again. She's visiting her family. She really enjoyed her time with you last year. Three movies in one day, right? Ah, it was four, with a dinner break. The holiday releases this year, they look super good. You guys, I told you. No more casual dating. Okay, well, it's only casual if it doesn't turn serious. It's not going to turn serious with Lucy. She lives a thousand miles away. Details. We just hate seeing so much talent go to waste. Good men are hard to find... or so I've heard. Okay, then you should put yourself back on the market. I can't. I meant it when I said "I do." Right answer. All right, you know what? That's my cue to leave. Sort. I'll help. Ho, ho, ho! Oh, please tell me one of those plates is for us. -You know it. -Yes! What're you watching? [Lauren]: That cute elf movie? "The Good Elf!" Yes, that's the one. [movie playing on TV] You are an angel. That was sweet today, hey? Emma and her family. Yep. It's days like today I really love our job. Mm. Amen. Of course, it's not the job I dreamed of when I was a little girl. Well, ringmaster jobs are hard to come by. It's true! Plus, have you ever stood next to an elephant? Yeah. It's terrifying. I bet! I'm doing exactly what I dreamed of doing. I know. [♪♪♪] And Merry Christmas to you, too. Bye! Oh, Secret Santa... and I wrapped it myself this time. Like it? No peeking, though. No peeking. Bye. I'll see you later. Oh, hey, good morning, ladies! Hey, can you go shopping with me at lunch today? I need to price out supplies for that Christmas party. I can't. I have Pilates. I've got to watch every nickel if I'm going to pull this off. Yeah, speaking of that, when you were in the CFO's office, did you happen to notice any pictures of a wife or a girlfriend? I didn't. Because he is awfully... Handsome, yes. You said that. A couple times. [Walt]: Morning, guys. Good morning, Walt. Oh, uh, did you have a chance to sample those yet? Just to make sure they turned out okay. It's got to be a guy thing. Yes, they have been sampled, but thank you. Yeah, it was worth a shot. And put it back. Yeah, okay, putting it, putting it... putting it back. Okay, good. You are all here. Yeah, what's going on? So this morning, um... there was a letter waiting for me, from Human Resources, and there is no way to soft-pedal this. Um... I've been asked to take an early retirement. What? [Walt]: No! Are you serious? Well, the hospital is instituting some cost-cutting measures, and several senior staff have been let go. Wow. Merry Christmas! Jenny... You fired Alice? -Alice? -Shelby. My supervisor. Uh, let me check. Oh, right. You don't know who she is. You don't know her name, obviously. That's the only explanation for why you could have done something so unthinkable. Yeah... here she is. Look, I can see that you're upset. Alice is one of the hospital's guiding lights, okay? She's an inspiration! She has saved the lives of scores of babies. She has trained I don't know how many nurses. Well, now, hold on a minute, Jenny. I mean, she's not the only person that we're letting go. There's a number of people who are taking early retirement in all departments, even this one, and, may I add, with a severance and a full pension. The hospital's finances are really that bad? Yeah... they are. That's why I'm here. Brockman, he didn't want to do what had to be done. So they hired a hatchet man. They hired someone who is not afraid to make tough decisions. The hospital has to make cuts. The numbers simply don't add up. Alice isn't a number. She's a person. I'm sorry that it had to happen. Did it have to happen right before Christmas? [Alice talking quietly] Hi. Is everything okay? Yeah, a new arrival. A boy. He's 32 weeks, just under three pounds. Complications? No red flags yet. He's stable, and here, signing his chart... And could you bring the parents down? OB just released the mother. Yeah, of course. Thanks. Mr. and Mrs. Bradley? How is he? He's fine. Yeah, he's breathing easily, with help. His heartbeat is steady. When can we see him? Now. I'm Jenny Miller. I work in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, and your son... James. His names is James. It's a beautiful name. James is there right now, and the best doctors and nurses in the world are giving him their full attention, so let's go say hi. [Alice]: We don't have to tell you this, but James was born a little more than eight weeks early. Why? We don't know why. The truth is, 1 in 13 babies are born prematurely. And James was particularly eager to make an appearance. [Jenny]: Yeah, you got a real go-getter here. [Alice]: But the problem is, when a baby is born early, it doesn't have as much baby fat as if you were full-term. Besides making babies huggable and just adorable, baby fat helps keep him warm and prevents excess water loss. So that's our main focus right now, to keep James warm and hydrated, until he can do it on his own. That's why he's in the incubator. For how long? Well, I wish that I could say for certain, but it will probably be a few weeks. Will we be able to hold him? Not just yet, but you can see the incubator is designed so you can touch him, and as soon as pediatrics gives us the go-ahead, you will, and for however long James needs to be here, you guys can be right by his side, 24-7. We will. [Father]: If we're going to be spending so much quality time together... then please, call me Dan. And Selena. Dan and Selena. Welcome to your new temporaryhome. Um, if you want, you can go in and get closer. How are you doing? That was some pretty rough news this morning. Absorbing. The hospital is abuzz. Apparently, a dozen people "retiring early." Yeah, well, you're not going to be one of them. But if I am, it's okay. No, that's not okay! Well, nothing lasts forever, Jen. It... change is inevitable. Well... what are we going to do without you? You will be fine, just like you were today, because I trained you well. What will you do without us? Travel, and read all those books that I've been meaning to get to... and finally spend some more time with my brother and his family. [Jenny]: Well, I guess Dudley's going to be happy to have you around more. Well, I hope so, because he has a really big crush on his dog walker. Don't worry about me, Jen. This could be the best thing that's ever happened to me. Okay. Wow, your angels are still sending you Christmas cards. Yes, they are so thoughtful. It's incredible. [Jenny]: It's a party for nurses. You know, they're hard-working, underpaid... Yeah, I'm hardworking and underpaid. But look at how much I'm buying, though! Discounts on advertised items only. Come on, Chris... can I call you Chris? I'm on a really tight budget here. You know, I can actually verify that. There was a tight-fisted, bean-counting Scrooge, just slashed it to shreds. This is not my problem. You know what? Community Memorial is a non-profit, so any sort of discount that the store wants to give would be considered a tax write-off. Are you authorized to take donations on behalf of the hospital? No, but he is. I am. I am because I am the CFO of the hospital. There's a form for that. I'll be right back. -Thanks, Chris. -Great. Uh, you're welcome. Thank you. Wow... That's a pretty-- that's a pretty cold shoulder. Let me see. Is this...? Nope, not going to find that one any warmer. It's pretty frosty, too. You know what? I get that you're trying to be funny right now. I'm bringing my best stuff here. I'm not going to take the bait. Why... a little bit, you are. Little bit. I told you how I feel about what you're doing at the hospital this morning. Jenny, my job is not me. Well, mine is. I got the-- uh, form. Awesome. That's... thank you. There's no way you can keep Alice on? There really isn't. I'm sorry. Why not? Uh, well, first, it wouldn't be fair to the other people that we're letting go. You know, I'm sure their departments are upset that they're leaving, too. And that doesn't bother you? Tell you what... how about we not talk about this anymore? You see things your way, I see things my way. Fine. What's with all these canned goods? You planning on hibernating for the winter? No, my church puts together Christmas baskets for needy families. Hmm. The softer side of Scrooge. Well, I have to do good works. I'm not saving lives like you are. That is right. If you give me a second, I'll help you load your car. I think I can manage. Hey, if you need anything else, any other, you know, help with the party, let me know. Have a nice day, Jenny Miller. Bye. [Walt]: Hey! I had one of these when I was a kid. -Me, too. -Seriously? Yeah, I had a whole fleet of them. It was for her imaginary circus. Lucky. I just had the one. Those would be perfect for the holiday grab bags. So, guys, I've been thinking... this is going to be Alice's last Christmas party. Oh, thanks for reminding us. But what if we make the party all about her? A celebration of Alice! She'll never go for that. She hates being the center of attention. So we don't tell her. A surprise party! Cool. I'll DJ, by the way... free of charge. Thanks, pal! So, this is my idea. You know how she gets all those Christmas cards every year from families of former patients? Mm-hmm. Think of how many families there are, how many more patients. What if everybody sent her a Christmas card? Well, a lot of them do. Yeah, but there are plenty more that don't, so if we could somehow find them and tell them that Alice is leaving and encourage them to send a card... We could get a huge tree. We could hang all the cards on it. I was on the team that computerized our records last year. It'd be real easy for me to put together a database. -Really, you could do that? -Oh, you bet. You know what? We'll have the cards sent to our place. That way, Alice doesn't ever see them. That's perfect... but guys, we only have 16 days till the party, so we've got to get a move on... and also... it's a surprise, guys. Thank you. Hey, pal. Me too. [Matt]: Hey, sis. I'm good. You? That's great. Hey, I got a quick question for you and Eric about your holiday schedule. [elevator dings] Morning! Oh, good morning! Oh, Jenny! That database is in your in-box. Oh, thank you. Thank you for wrapping all those grab bag presents. Yeah, my pleasure. Selena. Dan, hi. -Hi. -Good morning. How was your night? Restless. We kept waking up to check on him, make sure he was okay. Well, you would be doing that if you were at home, too. [Selena]: I know, but at home, I could take him to bed with us. It's hard having him so close and not being able to hold him. We so want to bond with him. You will. I promise... and I would know. I was born prematurely. You were? Mm-hmm. I spent almost three weeks in an incubator, and my mother and I couldn't possibly be more bonded. The babies we nurse, we call them our angels, and we have a special mantra, courtesy of Alice. "We treasure our angels by each precious beat of their hearts." That's beautiful. James is getting stronger with each of his heartbeats, and if we have anything to say about it, there's going to be a couple billion more ahead. Matt! Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. Can I help you? Yeah, I was hoping to talk to you for a minute. Sure. Excuse me. Talk to me about what? Have you found a place, a venue for your party yet? No, but I'm working on it. Okay, I think that I found a fantastic place. I really don't need your help, Matt. I know you don't, but this place is perfect. I think you just need to see it. It's five minutes from the hospital. You're going to ask for Isabel, or Eric. That was really sweet, by the way. What was? What you said to that couple. Sweet. [children yelling] [train whistle toots] Hi. Hi! Hi. Welcome to Forever Young At Heart. This place is amazing! I've never seen anything like it. Exactly. Um, are you Isabel? Matt Crawford suggested I drop by. Oh, right, yes, you must be Jenny. Yes! Nice to meet you. You, too. So is this the venue? Yep. I'd give you the grand tour, but as you can see, it's one big happy place. Oh, I'll say. Now, your rental rate is...? For you, we can do 50% off. That's our family discount. Matt and I are not... Oh, no, I'm... I'm Matt's sister. He didn't mention that? He did not mention that. He did not. It was a pretty short conversation. I'm kind of mad at your brother, actually. Oh, are you one of the people that he had to let go from the hospital? No, no, but my supervisor is, and then he went and slashed the budget for this party. So he's trying to help you out. Yeah, I guess, but I'd really rather he didn't. Did you want me to charge you full price? Oh, no, please don't. This is-- This is perfect. [talking quietly] [Jenny]: Uh, hey, can you give me a minute? Oh... yeah. Take two if you need it. Thanks. Hey. Hey! I wanted you to tell you that I went to Forever Young At Heart today, and you're right. It's perfect. Yeah. Good. I thought that it would be. So I wanted to thank you for the recommendation and for the discount. You're welcome. And then, I want to just ask you to please stop helping me. Okay... why not? Because it's messed up. You created a problem... Wait a second. I didn't create anything. But I think that you need to own up to it instead of trying to make it up to me. Wow. Okay. Okay, I got that you were strong-willed and passionate about the things that you care about. I just missed the whole "world revolves around me" thing. What is that supposed to mean? Jenny, look, I'm tired of you trying to make me feel bad for doing what I have to do, for what the hospital tasked me to do. I have to cut the budget, and I am sorry that your friend, Alice, is losing her job... She's so much more than a friend. That really is a bad thing, but I'm not targeting Alice. I'm not targeting you. I'm not targeting anybody. I looked at the data, I saw what I had to do, and I did it. Yeah. You looked at the data. Is that all Alice is? Is that what I am? Wow. Sorry to keep you waiting. Oh, no worries. I always loved that picture of you and Bob. Oh, yeah. Me, too. That was from our "he swept me off my feet" phase. Yeah, no kidding. That looks like a couple crazy in love. Were you and my dad ever that crazy about each other? I loved your father. I was devastated when I lost him. I really wish I could have known him. You would have loved him, too. To have had that love, and then have Bob... I'm incredibly lucky. Yeah. I wonder if I'll ever get that lucky. Sure you will, if you want it. I don't know about that. The older I get, the more I just feel like I'm married to my work. Well, if that's what you want, there is nothing wrong with that. Let's go. Store closes at 8:00. The perfect gift, huh? I think so, but I'll let you judge for yourself. Can't wait. [Jenny]: When I was little, right after you and Bob were married, he took me shopping for my birthday, and he told me I could have anything I wanted. I remember that. So while I was busy trying to figure out which My Little Pony to get, he was captivated by this train set, and he told me that it was all he ever wanted when he was a boy, but his family couldn't afford it. No, I'm sure they couldn't have. So I kind of feel like you'd be making a boyhood dream come true, you know, and what would be more special for Christmas than that? We'll take this. [Jenny]: How are you going to keep Bob from seeing that before Christmas? [Kate]: I have a special hiding place. I've been thinking about that conversation we had earlier. Do you think I'm married to my job? Do you? I don't know. I mean, I love my job. You know, it's what I always wanted to do, but... sometimes, I feel like there should be more. Well... are you dating? No! No. I mean, it's not like anybody's asking me out, so... Well, it's the 21st century, Jenny. You can do the asking. Yeah, and if there was somebody that I really liked, I probably would, but... there isn't. Love has a very funny way of sneaking up on you, and if you keep your heart open, it just may surprise you. [Jenny]: Yeah. That's great. Okay, thank you. I have an appointment with a potential caterer tomorrow. Francisco. Oh. "Francisco" who? Just "Francisco." Well that's good, yeah! How'd you hear about him? Walt. He said that he catered one of his friends' weddings, and it was scrumptious. Are all these for Alice? Yep. The e-mail went out, like, two days ago! She's a popular lady. We're going to need a big tree. Oh, yeah. Goji bean, mint, and pumpkin seed. Now, that'll give you a taste of how I prepare food. I can't predict what will be served the night of your party. Oh, so there's no set menu? It depends on what ingredients are available the day of. Seasonal and fresh... that's my motto. Dig in. Thank you. Oh, my gosh! That's amazing, and I use that word sparingly. Thank you. Obviously, we'd love for you to cater the party. Are you available on the 20th? Ah, yeah. I had a cancellation. That's great. This is my budget. I can't possibly do it for this little. It's all I have to work with. This will barely cover my costs. It's... Look, it's for a really special group of people. It's, um... for the nursing staff at Community Memorial, in the NICU. It's an acronym for... Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Yeah, exactly. At Community Memorial? Yeah, and we just don't have the resources to... Mm. When I was a kid, my baby brother was a patient there, and they saved his life. Mm... It would be an honor to cater your party. -Really? -Mm-hmm. Thank you. You're welcome. Yeah, thank you so much. I can't wait! Oh! I'm sorry! -Hi. -Hi. It's you. All right, I'm not following you. I swear. I'm Christmas shopping. And I was just meeting with the caterer for the party. Oh, Francisco's! I know him. He catered my aunt's 60th. His food was the highlight of the party. Hey, Jenny Miller... last time I saw you, I said some things that I'm sorry about. I was out of line. Well, maybe I was, too. I mean, it's no excuse, but my job sometimes, it makes me insensitive... Or, if you believe my sister Isabel, I'm too sensitive, and so then, I try to find ways to compensate. Like with a cartful of canned goods? Yeah, or saving poinsettias for a damsel in distress. Oh, I'm not a damsel, and I'm not in distress. That's good, because my jousting dragons skills are rusty. Um... Well, I should get back to work. Yeah, me, too. Yeah. -Are you... -Same... way. [Matt]: Amazing. His food is exceptional. He uses all, like, table stuff. And at cost! And he's doing it at cost? That's very generous of him. I know. I'm not surprised, though. The things we do at Memorial, they have a very profound impact on people's lives. And nobody does it better than Alice. Well, they don't. All right, you're not going to believe me, but if I could save Alice's job, I would. I would save everybody's. You're right. I don't believe you. Listen, Jenny, in the real world, sometimes, you've got to make tough decisions for the greater good, and it's not always fun. So you're a realist, and I'm not. No, no. What I'm saying is that you see your reality from a very certain angle. You're clear about that. You know your mind, and you stick to your guns. Well, so do you. So see? We're not that different, Jenny Miller. All right, I've got a serious question for you. Do you have a Christmas tree yet for your Christmas party? No, and we're going to need a big one. Okay, I know where you can get a great tree. Of course you do. No, no. I'm saying, I know where you can get a truly unbelievable tree for a truly unbelievable price. Yeah? Are you going to make me ask where? No, I'm going to make you come with me to go get it. Matt... Come on, we've got a nice thing going. I don't want to break up the momentum. [phone chimes] Jenny, I didn't come to Community to make enemies... especially not somebody like you. Come with me. Get to know me. See that I'm not such a bad guy. Oh, I've got to get back to the hospital. Is everything okay? I don't know... uh, bye! Bye, Jenny. [Jenny]: Hey. Hey, um, they're with Alice. [Alice]: So we did, and, of course, you were our first call. [knocks gently] Hi. I got here as fast as I could. I was just walking the Bradleys through this. It's James' heart. It's common with pre-term infants. And the doctor performing the surgery is the absolute best. She's done this procedure hundreds of times. Successfully. The best place for James to be is right here. When will the doctor do the surgery? First thing Monday morning. The 16th. Her birthday. Can we be there with James? No... but I will be with you, every moment. All right. Turn on the juice. Wow! Ho, ho, ho! [Bob]: How does it look? -Fabulous. -You nailed it, Bob. Hey, wait a minute. Where's Rudolph? Rudolf's not here? No, he isn't. Ah, he must be in the house somewhere. I'll go get him. Where'd you hide him? In the garage, behind a few boxes. Maybe he won't look there. We can hope. How is Christmas party planning? Oh, it's coming along. We're going to go get a tree tomorrow. Oh, you need some help? No, somebody from work is helping. Oh, uh, Lauren? Uh, Matt. His name's Matt. You haven't mentioned Matt. Well, that's 'cause he just started working there. In NICU? Business affairs. You know him well enough to buy a Christmas tree already? Mom... He's just a friend. Where'd you meet him? At the hospital, where we both work. Oh. Someone introduced you? Mom! Sorry, am I asking too many questions? You think? Don't you think Bob did a great job? [Jenny]: Yeah... and you know what? I think I do miss Rudolph. Me too. Crawford's Hauling and Delivery at your service, ma'am. Is this yours? Eric's. It's for hauling all that playground equipment. It looks like it could scale Mt. Everest. Which will come in handy where we're going. 'Kay, where are we going? Hop in and find out. Buckle up. [♪♪♪] This is beautiful. I know, and it's only an hour outside of the city. Wow. I've never even been up here. Most people haven't. You know, I used to hike here when I was a little kid. Seems pretty off the beaten track for a Christmas tree farm, though. Who said anything about a Christmas tree farm? Wait. What? We're cutting down a tree? Yeah, this place is crawling with them. Yeah, but isn't that illegal? Not if you have a permit. And do we have a permit? Jenny Miller, do you not know me by now? Of course, we have a permit! Of course, we have a permit. Uh, so am I supposed to use these? You can if you want to. I mean, you don't have to. You can let me do all the work, but I think that would be out of character, Jenny Miller. You might be surprised. I'd like to be surprised by you. Then again, it might be me doing all the work, and you just standing around. Let's just find a tree first. Which way? Tell you what... Let's go this way. You have no idea where to find a Christmas tree, do you? That's all part of the adventure. All right. [Kate]: My darling Bob, over the last 30 years, you've worked so hard to make all my dreams a reality. With this gift, I hope I can make a forgotten dream of yours come true. I will love you forever. Kate. This one looks pleasantly plump. How 'bout that one? It's too small. Shape is good, but it's too small. Shape is good. It's too small. What exactly are you looking for? You know what? I think I'm just going to know when I see it. There it is. Hallelujah. This'll be perfect! See, don't you think it was totally worth waiting for? [gasps] [♪♪♪] Are you okay? That's it. You're dead. Hi, buddy. How are ya? Hi! Look what I got! Look what I got. Yeah. Okay. Let's see... Let's see about this. Okay. Well... ♪ ...Love is everywhere ♪ Love is everywhere [♪♪♪] ♪ Love is everywhere [Jenny]: I cannot believe that we were able to get that tree to the truck. It's teamwork. And strong ropes. Strong ropes. By the way, this hot chocolate is unbelievable. -Right? -Yes. This is amazing. My dad used to get me to go hiking when I was a kid. He'd bring me here on the way home. It was used as a bribe. You're not a hiker, hey? Mm-mm. I mean, I am now. I love hiking. I love hiking more than I love hot chocolate, but... I think that was his plan all along. Smart guy. He was a super smart guy. I miss him. Oh, is he gone? Yeah, he, um... he passed away a few years ago. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's why I'm back. I came back to be with my mom and my sister, Isabel. Where were you? I was in Boston. Went to college there, and just stayed put. Do you miss it? No. This is more my speed. All right, enough about me. What's your secret, Jenny Miller? Mom, dad, siblings, your pet... Uh... I'm an only child. My parents live here. Well, it's my mom and my step-dad. My dad-dad died when I was an infant. I'm sorry. It's okay. I was young. I don't remember him. I bet that you do. I bet you do. Not the conscious you, but the subconscious you. I just think that babies take in a lot. I'm sorry! What do I know? I'm talking about babies to a baby expert. No, no. I think you know plenty. All right. Maybe we should go before my sister closes Forever Young at Heart, get the tree up. I think... I think that before we go, we have time for one more hot chocolate, maybe? Oh, no, I don't think I could. Okay. All right. Matt Crawford, do you not know me at all by now? Hey, Sarah, could we get two more hot chocolates, please? [Isabel]: Bye. Bye. Thank you. Goodnight. Wow! You guys, this looks amazing! Yeah. Thanks for letting us set up early. No, thank you. The customers are going to love this. Now, would it be cool if I came over on Thursday night, the night before the party, to set up? Of course. [Jenny]: Great. [Matt]: Eric. Thank you for the loan. Any time. All right. Sis, see ya. Bye. -Thank you again. -Thank you. Have a good night. Thanks. -See you soon! -You bet. Take care. -Here's your coat. -Thank you. Well? I can't tell. I know! Their body language is impossible to tell. She seems nice. Really nice, but then again, your brother is really picky... like me. Okay, smooth. Really smooth. [Jenny]: Thank you for today. So you didn't find me to be too helpful? Oh, once or twice. So this friendship has a chance? I won't rule it out. In that case, do you skate? Well, not to get all braggy on you, but I'm kind of Ice-Castles-awesome on skates. Snow Flake Rink has a two-for-one special on Monday nights. Let's meet to skate. We'll continue our cost-cutting streak. We could. Great, so, um... I will meet you there Monday at 8:00? Sure, why not? Then it's a... I'll see you then. Uh-huh, I will see you then. Oh, well... Does the operation usually take this long? Yes. This is completely normal. I am sure that we're going to hear something any moment. Oh! I almost forgot. Happy birthday. You shouldn't have done that. Too late. I already did. Thank you. [Jenny]: It's a baby book. You can put pictures of James in there. You can write down thoughts as you watch him grow. Have you ever kept a diary? No. I did. Junior high. It's so funny reading it now. All those thoughts and feelings that were so monumental at the time, I don't even... I don't even remember them anymore. I don't think I could forget how I'm feeling now. No, of course not. How could you? But writing about it might help you get through it. Certainly helped me get through junior high. Junior high was a bear, that's for sure. [Doctor]: Everything went very well. Hey! Hi! Oh, Eric! Uh, Isabel! I didn't know that you guys were going to be here. Surprise! Double date. Oh, no! Uh, not a date. It's not a date! Right. Matt tells me that you're an incredible skater. Apparently. I haven't seen her on the ice yet, so... Matt'll give you a run for your money. I did a little hockey in college. Little? All-state. Don't challenge him to a race. Well, I wasn't going to race. I was just going to skate. That's good... 'cause I'd whoop you out there. Oh, really? That's interesting. And the gauntlet has been thrown. Oh, my gosh. What? Alice! That's Alice Shelby? I'll be right back. Who's Alice Shelby? It's Jenny's supervisor from work. The one you fired? Yeah. Awkward. Hi! Jenny! I didn't know you skate! I don't, but I've always wanted to. Now I have the time to learn. Oh, right. Are you here alone? Yeah. You? Um... I'm just here with some friends. Oh... Is that Matt Crawford? The new CFO? Yeah, you guys have met? No. Someone pointed him out to me in the cafeteria, but I would like to. Introduce me. Well, okay. Um... Matt? Uh, Eric... Isabel... this is Alice. Hi. [Alice]: Nice to meet you... and I'm not going to be coy, Matt. I know who you are. Hi, Alice. [Isabel]: Alice? It was nice to meet you. Yeah. Nice meeting you. We're just... All right, have fun. Should I... Should I go, too? Don't be silly. We all have a job to do, and I lost mine just because you were doing yours. That's life, and it really was very nice to meet you. So, now I have to go find my instructor, and when you see me out there on the ice... don't laugh. Oh... Okay. Wow. I know. I told you, she's amazing. I'm a believer. Are you having second thoughts there, hatchet man? 'Cause she may be letting you off the hook, but I'm not. Yeah, see, I'd be disappointed if you did. So, all-state hockey, hey? Long time ago. I'm way off my game. Well, let's find out. You're not going to out-race me if you just stand there. ♪ Give me back the Christmas that I know ♪ ♪ Hanging off the tree and mistletoe ♪ ♪ I'll meet you there ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ Give me back the Yuletide that I miss ♪ ♪ Sweep off the dust from Old Saint Nick ♪ ♪ He's got the gifts ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ All I want for Christmas ♪ All my people coming home... Sorry! ♪ All I want for Christmas ♪ Is the Christmas that I know... ♪ I'm going to be sore tomorrow. Ugh, you and me both. Hey, by the way, I declare a tie. Oh, come on, Eric! I totally won. Somebody's in serious denial. Okay, it is not about winning or losing. It is about enjoying yourself. Right? Nah. I have really enjoyed meeting you all, and I want to thank you for not knocking me over out there. You are going to be out-racing us soon. Well, I doubt that, but I can only get better, and it has been really great to tackle something new. Come on. I need my beauty rest. I've got to get home, too. Dudley needs his bedtime walk. Of course. I'll see you in the morning. See you tomorrow. Goodnight, Matt. Goodnight, Alice. Come on, I'll walk you to your car. Well, you were very good at ice skating. Like, Michelle Kwan... Yeah, you weren't so bad yourself. Thanks. Hey, I've been thinking... and I want to tell you something. Um, I've been giving a lot of thought to the hospital business... Hey! Sorry, about hospitals. Thank you. And what I've come to realize is that we are in customer service. In fact, we are in the ultimate customer service. How do you mean? Well, the way that doctors and nurses and staff treat patients on a personal level is as important as how they treat them on a medical level. That's for sure. It's all about a deft touch and a big heart. Sure is. And meeting Alice tonight, and just for a few minutes, I... I see that she's all about deft touch and a big heart. I get that, and losing her would be like losing a lifetime of experience in quality customer service. That'd be hard to replace. Wow. You really have been catching up on the hospital business. It's nice... us not, you know, bumping heads, or at least, not as often. Yeah. The headaches... It's like playing hockey again. All right, I've got to go. It's getting late. Early morning tomorrow. Hey, when you're done with your shift, maybe I pick you up, take you out to dinner? Maybe we can finish this conversation. Yeah, I'd like that. Good, then it's a plan. No, um... It's a date. [kisses] And I totally whupped you on that ice today. [laughs] Goodnight, Jenny Miller. Night! Morning! Good morning! There's coffee. Ooh, thank you. You got in late last night. 10:00? It's not that late. Uh, it is for you. That's a sad commentary on my social life. Wait, do you have a social life? I might. Tell me everything, and leave out nothing. Ugh! I like him... and we're going out again tonight, so... we'll see how it goes. Wow, you wild, romantic, impetuous fools. Considering that I wanted to throttle the guy two and a half weeks ago, I think we're moving plenty fast enough. I think you should stay out past 11:00, spread your wings a little next time. Oh, my goodness! Are these still coming in? Yeah... oh, I was going to ask you, Should we take them out of the envelope before we pin them to the tree? Otherwise, it's going to take Alice forever to open all these. Mm, that's a good point. Yeah, do it. -Okay. -[phone chimes] Is that Matt? No... it's Walt. Oh. Oh, he has the night shift tonight, but the Pop Warner team he coaches is having its final game, so he wants me to sub. Please tell me you're not going to say yes. What? Of course I am. What about your date? My date can wait 'til tomorrow. Unless, of course, you want to work tonight? Oh, um, yeah. Have a wonderful evening at the hospital. Thanks. [phone rings] Hi. Is this Michelle Kwan? [chuckles] My childhood hero. [laughs] You know, I was always more of a Tara Lipinski fan myself. Hey, listen, I can't do dinner tonight. I have to work. Oh, that's okay. How about lunch instead? Ooh, I can't. I have lunch with my mom. How about tomorrow night? Yeah, tomorrow night. Have fun with your mom. Thank you! Bye. [phone rings] Hello? Hi, uh, I'm trying to reach Jenny Miller. This is Jenny Miller. Hi. My name is Greg Carter. You don't know me, but, um... I got your e-mail about Alice Shelby's retirement party. I'm one of her angels. That's great! Did you manage to send a card? Yeah, um... and I was just curious, when is she leaving the hospital? The first of the year. Do you think it would be okay if I dropped by the NICU before then, to wish her well in person? I am sure she would love that. Great... and don't mention anything, okay? I want it to be a surprise. Greg, you've given me a great idea. I'll text you later. Great. [Jenny]: I hope you and Dad can make it to the Christmas party. [Kate]: I thought you were on a tight budget. Yeah, well, I managed to cut some corners, and I really just want you guys to meet Alice before she goes. Okay, sure. I'll bring my Christmas cookies. Yes! My ruse worked. Under the heading of "none of my business," how was Christmas tree shopping with your friend, Matt? Um, pretty great, actually. We went into the forest, we got our own tree, and then he took me to this roadside diner, where we had really good hot chocolate. Are you going to see him again? I already did. We went ice skating yesterday, and we're going to go for dinner tomorrow. Okay, this is major news. Mom, we're still just getting to know each other, okay? And enjoying every minute of it, it seems. Yes. Yeah, there were bumps at first, but... I am really enjoying it. What's he like? He's funny... um, thoughtful... he's a really good skater, and, as Lauren never tires of pointing out, he's... quite handsome. And what about the bumps? I think it just took me a while to figure out who he really is. You really like this guy. I really do. [Jenny]: Hey! What are you doing here? I am reporting for duty. How are our patients? Stable and sleeping, and little baby James is recovering as well as any baby I've ever seen. That's wonderful. I thought Ashley was doing the graveyard tonight. I gave her the night off. Why? Because I like the graveyard shift. I always have... although I'm not crazy about the name. [chuckles] Does seem inappropriate for a hospital, doesn't it? It's just so quiet this time of night. It's peaceful... and you can almost forget that this is a place where people are sick and hurting. Yeah, I know what you mean. And this time of year, it always reminds me of that other midnight clear... and how special Christmas is. This Christmas feels bittersweet. Sweet because of your new friend in business affairs? And bitter because of what he was forced to do. I don't want to leave, Jen. I will admit that, and I certainly never imagined myself leaving. No, none of us did. It's probably time. I'm getting fewer Christmas cards from angels this year. Oh? Yeah. It's a message, I think. Life moves on. They have, so... so should I. It's just the natural order. I don't know about that. By the way, although no one's asked for my input yet, if they do, I'm going to recommend you as my replacement. What? Me! Uh, no, no. I'm not qualified. Of course you are. You are smart, and you're dedicated, and you're compassionate, and you're quick on your feet, you're great with people... Okay, that's enough. And self-effacing. Goodnight, Alice. Goodnight, Jen. [train whistle toots] [bell rings] Hey. So I'm betting that after a long shift, you're hungry. Frankly, I couldn't wait 'til tomorrow. [laughs] It's midnight! Is anything open? For us, there is. Come on. Oh, my goodness. Ah! Do you even know how to drive this thing? Um... no... but don't tell Eric. [engine starts] All right, are you ready? [train whistle toots] [Jenny]: Oh, my goodness, there's more. [Francisco]: Etoile de Noel... It's beautiful. Thank you, Francisco. Oh, my aunt Maya, she says hello. Oh, tell her I say hi. -Enjoy. -Thank you. I can't even... this is... It looks amazing. Amazing. All right, um, lights on your Christmas tree... white lights, or colored lights? White lights. Classic girl. What's your favorite Christmas carol? "Joy To The World." "Silent Night." Favorite Christmas pop song? "Jingle Bell Rock." "Little St. Nick." Favorite Christmas movie Oh, easy. It's a Wonderful Life. If you'd said anything else, I'd be out of here. New Year's resolution that you can never keep? Oh, my goodness. Where to start? Me too. A list, like, a mile long. New Year's resolution that you plan to make this year? I think I'm going to keep that one to myself. Probably a good idea. Don't want to jinx it. It's a New Year's resolution that I plan on keeping. Me, too. That's a good start.

Hey, what was with all the phone calls and texting tonight? Can you keep a secret? Well, I can certainly try. You've got to promise! Fine, I promise. [phone chimes] Hi, guys. Hi! I was just reading the good news. Better than expected weight gain. [Selena]: Starting to breathe a little on his own. Well, I'm not surprised. You have a tough little guy in there. He better not be too tough. Only in the ways that count. Is it too much to hope we might have him home for Christmas? Well, hoping isn't a bad thing, but I wouldn't count on it. But remember, you're going to have a lifetime of Christmases after this. All those precious heartbeats. Billions of them. Right now, I just want to hold him... really hold him. You will. Yeah. I made tamales for the party tonight. A family tradition. Selena! I know you already have a caterer, but anything he makes... well, it won't be made with nearly as much love and gratitude. Thank you. They're in the fridge in the nurses' lounge. I already told Walt to keep away from them until tonight. Smart move. All right, well... I'll check in on you later. Hi! Hi! What are you doing for lunch? I am meeting Matt. Oh, nice! I'm going to the Snow Flake. Do you two want to join me? Mm, I'm hungry... but you're really into this skating thing. Yeah, and who knows... today, I might even let go of the rail. Ooh! Good luck! [Matt]: Yeah, it is Christmas time. You're absolutely right, and a 5% salary reduction is a significant hit. If there was another way to do this, we would do it, but there's not. I mean, sacrifices have to be made to protect the bottom line. Okay. Okay, you, too. Hey, Jenny! Jenny, I was just going to come find you. Isabel told me about a... I can't go to lunch with you, Matt. Why? This just isn't going to work out. -What? -Us. Um, yeah, I thought it would, and I hoped it would, but... it's not. Jen... I don't understand. I just can't do this. Okay? [♪♪♪] [Alice gasps and screams] There you are! You are not going to believe what happened. Thanks. Are you okay? I thought you were supposed to be having lunch with Matt. No more lunches with Matt. No more anything with Matt. Why, what happened? I was just wrong about him... or rather, I was so right about him in the first place. You guys get in a fight? You know what? I don't really want to talk about it. Actually, I don't even want to think about it. I just... I just want to focus on the party. Yeah, see, that's what you're not going to believe. Alice just pulled a back muscle. What? Yeah, ice skating. She just went home. That's awful. That party we planned for her tonight? She's not going to be there. Maybe we should just postpone the party. No, we can't do that. There are way too many moving parts. Way too many. We've just got to make sure that Alice gets there. How are we going to do that? Um, well, if I have to throw her over my shoulder and carry her there, I will do that. See? Taking charge. This is why you are going to make a great supervisor. Oh. Did Alice tell you about that? Yeah. I think it's a great idea, and so do all the other nurses. Great. No pressure. I'm sorry about Matt. You know what, let's just keep our eyes on the prize. This is all about Alice, okay? She didn't give you a reason? No. Nothing. Sounds like maybe she got cold feet. And I flooded her with the patented Crawford charm, the full court press. I guess it's better you found out now things weren't going to work out. I got her such a great Christmas present. Hi, guys! [Dan]: Wow. [Selena]: What a gorgeous dress! This old thing? Hope you guys have a great time at the party. Thank you. Obviously, I'm on my way there, but, um... I have one last order of business before I clock out. This is Ashley. She's part of the excellent crew that's going to be subbing in for us tonight. I consulted with the team today, and I spoke to the head of Pediatrics... and we all decided that because your little fellow is doing so well... that it might be time to spend some quality time with Mom and Dad. Thank you. Merry Christmas, guys. [knocking] Who's that, Dudley? Oh, who do you think that is? [knocking] Uh... oh! Wow... Oh, you look beautiful, but what are you doing here? Uh-uh. What are you doing here? You should be at the party. I know, but I just don't want my back going out in the middle of everybody's fun. Standing and walking. No crutches or cane. Noted. Okay, you got 10 minutes to put your party dress on... Oh, come on, guys... Or... you are coming to the party wearing that. [Dudley barks] Even Dudley's got my back. [♪♪♪] She loves Christmas. She sure does. And look at the beautiful decorations. If I could direct your attention over this way... What is th... What did you do? [Walt]: Some personal decorations here, too. Take a look. Oh, my... Your angels didn't stop sending you cards. They just sent them somewhere else. There's so many! [Jenny]: Well, we told people you were leaving, and they wanted to wish you well. That's... wow. [Jenny]: Now, for some people, it wasn't quite enough to send a card, so... Alice? Hi, it's Greg Carter, Alice. I've changed a bit since you last saw me. Gregory Carter! Wow... My goodness, you are all grown up. Aw, thank you. It's lovely. How are you? How are your parents? I remember... it's Rachel and Mel, right? You should ask them yourself. Hello! Wow, it's been a long time. Oh, thank you for... for coming. [tearing up] I'm sorry, this is just... It's a big surprise. Happy holidays. Thank you. You too. Hi! Hey, Zoey. She looks great. -Thank you. -Congratulations again. Are you sleeping at all? No. As it should be. Thank you for being here. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Oh! And are you all family? This is my baby brother. Aw, what a great coincidence! Thank you... and look at all of you! Hello! How did you all find me here? So happy to see you. So happy to see you all. Merry Christmas. Hello. Hi. Oh, I remember you. Thank you for being here. You did good. "We..." and we just sent out the word. This is all Alice. She spent her whole life working on this. Hi! Merry Christmas. I remember you. Hello. Oh! My mom and dad. It's the best Christmas present. Thank you. Hi, guys! -I'm so glad you came! -So glad to be here. I want you to meet the star of the show. [Jenny laughs] One more, okay? I just, I want you to meet my mom and step-dad. This is Kate. Wonderful to meet you. And Bob. Jenny's told us so much about you. We feel like we know you already. Actually, have we met? No, I don't think so. Uh... Kate, right? Kate... Kate Magruder? Magruder was my first husband's name. He passed away when Jenny was very young. I'm Kate Miller now. You wouldn't remember me because I was just so young. I was, um, just fresh out of nursing school. I was a very small, very peripheral part of the team that treated your newborn... and I remember you because your little Mary was the very first baby that I was ever actually able to help save. How is she? Wow, where is she? I never liked the name Mary. Um... Jennifer's my middle name. Oh, my goodness. I've always felt like one of your angels. Now I know why. Tonight, I'm one of your angels. That is right, and we're just getting started. So... you stay, right here. Hi, guys! Thank you all so much for coming. [applause] We all know why we're here... to celebrate Christmas, of course... but just as much to celebrate the extraordinary Alice Shelby... [applause] Come on... Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, all. Thank you so much. And everything that Alice has done for each one of us. We have a little custom, as most of you know, at the NICU on the occasion of departures. Our special Alice, we bid you adieu. Go spread your sweet wings and fly. We'd keep you forever, if only we could... but now we must hug you goodbye... but though you are leaving, you won't be forgotten. We'll never be truly apart. You're special, dear Alice... we love you so much, and each precious beat of your heart. Thank you, Jenny. Thank you. [applause] May I? This? If I could have your attention just for a moment longer, everyone, um... I'm Matt Crawford. You wouldn't be here tonight, wishing Alice well on the next leg of her journey if it hadn't been for me. Um... I'm the guy who let her go. I know, I know. I did that before I knew Alice, or the NICU, or really anything about Community Memorial and the people who work there. They were just... well, you were just numbers to me... data... but somebody that I have come to really care about and admire reminded me that people aren't numbers or data. So, at the risk of being the worst party-pooper ever, I have to tell you that we can't help Alice celebrate the next leg of her journey tonight... sorry... because... if you want your job back, you can have it. In fact, everybody I let go can. I talked to management. I made an appeal, and the senior staff at the hospital, and almost to a person, everyone agreed on a 5% salary cut for the upcoming year, to keep everybody on until I can find a more hospital-friendly way to save some money. So, Alice... what do you say? Can I give you back your job? An early Christmas present? Yes! Yes, you certainly can. [enthusiastic applause] And what say you? Should we shut this shindig down as no longer necessary, or party on? Party on! That's the spirit. Merry Christmas, everybody! [applause] -I'm so sorry. -Thank you. It's a great gift. Thank you. Well, I hope Jenny liked her Christmas present. Uh, you think? Yeah. [Isabel]: Oh, that's my cue. Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-- Does that mean that you want to see me again? I'll take that as a "yes." Yes. This is going to be the best Christmas ever. It already is. [♪♪♪]
