Highway patrol hopes to have the accident cleared by 9:30. My advice? Skip rush hour, head to the beach, or crank on the air conditioning. It's gonna be a scorcher. Highs on the coast sneaking well into the 90s. In other news, the Malibu… Lifeguard 23, this is Doug. And how may I help you, sir? Heather, please. I can't afford to replace you mid season. I think a transfer is best for both of us, Pete. How long you been seeing him? We're not together anymore, I'm not talking about this. It's just a hiccup. I wanna get married and have kids, you don't. You call that a hiccup? I can't make any promises, I'm sorry. We'll work it out. You've had three years, I'm moving on. I'll see what we can figure out. All the people to choose. I didn't know who he was when I met him. Well, he's gonna know who I am when we meet, trust me. Well, that's typical. This beach is my responsibility. Not a day goes by without someone complaining about that monstrosity this guy's renovating. Complaint of the day? What? The workers have blocked off part of the north parking lot. It's public property. Who the hell do these guys think they are? Well, I spoke to the guy in charge about half an hour ago. He says it's only temporary, you know, keep people away from the construction vehicles and so on. Yeah, it's temporary, all right. You better call your friend, tell him to take an early lunch. Pete. Hey, Pete, wait up. Pete, don't you think you should cool off a bit? Whatever, Doug. Barb, you got next patrol, get on it. Yeah, sure. Oh, what's with him? Romantic problems. Isn't love wonderful? Well, you'll never see me getting in that deep. And if you felt life was a little shaky this morning, you aren't alone. A 5.5 tremor registered just off the coast at 6:15. Thankfully, there was no damage reported. Yeah, it's okay. No, no, really. Don't worry. I can handle it. Can you just not be there? I don't want anyone getting hurt. Forget that. I'm not running away from anybody. And least of all, him. Look, it's just better we get this thing settled anyway. Just try not to provoke him. Promise. Trust me. Okay. Well, call me afterwards. Bye. Bye. Everything okay? Yeah. Some kids drove by way too fast a few minutes ago. Really? Okay, I'll keep an eye out. Dougie! Hi! Can you sign this? Don't call me Dougie. What do you say, Barb? Should we let her off the hook? No. No one gets signed off until they do their full hundred hours. Do you know how long a hundred hours is? Come on. It's community service. Like who cares, you know? We do. Doug, please cut me some slack. Sorry, kid. No can do. Why not? Because you need to take responsibility for your actions. Yeah, yeah. Blah, blah, blah. I made one mistake, and I have to pay for it for the rest of my life. A hundred hours isn't exactly the rest of your life. Ooh, wait, this is a good one. Ooh, yeah Be my itchy bitchy That's the future of America. Makes you proud, doesn't it? Ooh, yeah Ooh, yeah Be my itchy, bitchy baby Ooh Watch out for that one there. Heather! Maybe she'll sign it for me. Heather, wait! She hasn't got a prayer. Heather, wait, please sign this? Later. Uh, excuse me, I was- Oh. Do I know you? Well, is that a philosophical question? Is it ever possible to really know somebody? I don't know. You're gonna get me fired! What are you doing here? Well, I was looking for lost and found. I found this in the sand. Oh my god. You found this? Where? Oh, just over there. It's beautiful. Oh, you think so? Well, maybe we should see if it fits. Hey! Wow. Whoever gets this back is going to be very happy. I tell you what… Marry me. And they might let you keep it. You're kidding. No, I'm not. Oh my god. And this would be the point where you say, "Yes, darling, I'll marry you!" Now? Right now? Yeah, right now. I got your whole family in the car, and I got a minister right here in my… No, not right now. When? Well, you haven't said yes! Yes! When? So, I was thinking maybe the day after we graduate. Why do we have to wait so long? Well, think about it. Your marine biology plan. So? Well, think about it. Think about the prestige. Big nobody, Bryan Conroy, weds Dr. Barbara Simmons, PhD. You're not a nobody. You're my guy. Mr. Dr. Barbara Simmons. I like it. It fits. It's good. You're scaring me a little bit now. Yeah, well, I got a bachelor's degree in theater arts, and I'm unemployed, so, you know what? You, you should be scared. No. You're gonna make it big someday. Kiss me, stupid. Geez! Guys, guys! Come on, get a room. What are you doing? Oh. He asked me to marry him. Seriously? Yeah. Well, congratulations. That's great. Heather, sweetheart, best friend. Do you think there's some way I can maybe get an hour off? Now? Yeah, you know, we just want to hold hands or something. Private. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you! 20 minutes. Ludwig, let's do this! That's awesome! Woo! Hey. Awesome, man. Whoa! What's up with that? You're not gonna go postal on us, are you? Uh, no, just pig hunting. Some friends are taking me up the coast for a few days. So, when do we leave? It's guys only. You're not gonna wear that to work, are you? No, I have a bikini top underneath. I guess this job does have its benefits. Here. Unzip me. Maybe we should do this again sometime. Here. Put this someplace where it'll stay dry. Do you work guys like this all the time? Only when I want something. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Woo! Yeah! Time for a break? You wish. What? I've been out there for hours. If you can't do the time, don't do the crime. It wasn't even $20 for the stuff. But you did steal it, right? Well, it wasn't like I stole it from a person. It was a department store, and they overcharge people anyway. It's not like they don't have insurance, so what's the big deal? You now, you're awfully tall for a five year old. You know, I could never a date a guy like you, seriously. Well, I have no reason to live. Don't even think about asking me out. I won't. Oh, please, you're so totally into me. Admit it. It's true. I can't live without you, but I'll try. Heather, we've got a complaint about some partiers parasailing. Can you check it out? Hey. Get me your boss. Sure. You Smith? He's around the corner. Smith. Let me guess, you're Mr. Chavez. You blasting? There's some deep rock we're channeling into. We have a power license. Can I see it? I'll show it to a city inspector. Anything else? Gotta open up the parking lot. It's temporary. Keeps people outta harm's way. It's a public parking space. You can't just do it off of your own convenience. Look. Let's quit beating around the bush here, okay? We both know what this is all about. Yeah. It's about people not being able to park. It's about keeping their cars from being damaged by the trucks going in and out. We both know you wouldn't be here if I wasn't seeing your ex. Why don't we leave Heather out of this? I'm just here doing my job, that's all. Yeah. Look, you got your own parking lot. And now, you're taking 25 spaces that belong to the county. So what I'm gonna need you to do is go ahead and move that access road about a hundred feet to the left. We're digging there, putting in a pool. Looks like you're outta luck. Hey! Stop it! I'm all wet. All right! Oh, John! Get us outta here! Hey, give it back! Hey! Come on! Come on! I'm coming! Help! Help me! Oh, God! And it looks like all kinds of sea life have been affected by our underwater earthquake. Whale sighting have been reported all along the coast, including… Level nine tsunami alert for the entire west coast of Southern California and the Baja Peninsula issued by NAA Hawaii. Close all beaches immediately and move to high ground. Repeat, close all beaches immediately, move to high ground. Acknowledged. Get your people to safety. Anybody copy? This is Doug. Doug, sound the alarm and clear the beach. And get up to the parking lot, make sure everyone gets out safe. Yeah. Got it. Why? What's up? It's a tsunami. Jenny, come on. What happened? What's wrong, Doug? Get outta here. Just get your car and go. Whoa, come on. Is this a test? What? We gotta clear the beach. It's a tsunami. It's a what? Don't waste time, just get outta here, run! Are you coming? Go! Go! Get off the beach! Come on, you guys! Off the beach! Everybody go! Everybody off the beach, there's a tsunami! Go! Move it! Move it, people! Off the beach! Go, go, go! Do it! Tsunami, go! To the cars! Maybe it won't be as bad as they think. George, this is the real deal. Think earthquake, only a lot wetter. Bags of cement up against the windows and doors. Maybe keep some of the water out. Good. You guys hit the road. I'll be along later. You're not leaving? Are you nuts? I've got everything I own tied up in this renovation. I lose this job and all the gear, I've got nothing. Is it worth your life? I'm staying. Staying, you're crazy. Where's your car? Over there. Get outta here as fast as you can. Is it really that bad? Just go. Boys! Boys! You guys need to get out of here. Where are your parents? Move it! Help these ladies! Okay, come on, let's go! Take her. Help me get them out of here. Why are you still here? I was helping someone. All right, then just go! Something to remember me by. Get outta here! Go, go, go! Thank God. Colin! We're not going anywhere. The highway's jammed. Come on, let's go. Come on. And all residents have been advised to evacuate immediately. Traffic on the Pacific Coast Highway is jammed with cars stretching all the way back to Venice Beach. Doug! Look out! Doug! Jenny! You can't leave, Jenny! Shoot it, it's still alive! No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Get back! Are you insane? This is amazing. What is it? It's a goblin shark. I don't care what it is, kill it. No, no, no. Listen. Goblin sharks were thought to be extinct. They're extremely rare. What are you talking about? This is incredible. This is a major find. We need to figure out a way to save this. We don't have any time for that, just kill it. No, you can't! You can't. Oh, geez. Kill it! Don't. Station one. Oh, hell. Everybody back to the height. Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go! Brace yourselves. Come on! Against the walls, in the corner. A devastating killer wave described as a "wall of water" 100 feet high has hammered the coast of California. The LA County Emergency Response Team reporting moments ago by shortwave, that their offices and equipment are currently under 30 feet of water. All rescue efforts now being hampered by debris. Making landfall at 10:17 a.m. local time, Cal Tech Instruments have measured this killer wave to be larger than the tsunami that hit Indonesia back in 2004. Now the mayor of Los Angeles is appealing to all off-duty first responders to get to their nearest disaster relief center. Stay tuned for more details. Heather. Bryan. Oh my god. Help! Quick! My leg! Get her on the counter. Get the first aid kit, we're gonna try and stop the bleeding. It's all right. Breathe! Breathe, Bryan, breathe! Come on! Oh, god. Okay, okay. Ow! How bad is it? You'll live. Will I lose my leg? No, you just need stitches is all. Gotta get her to a hospital. Ow. Okay, well, let's see where we stand. We're a quarter mile from land. We're in trouble, and we're not alone. We need to put a pressure bandage on that. Nope. She needs stitches. There's no anesthetic. Can't it wait? She's losing too much blood, we gotta close it up. Ow, ow! Electronics are out or towers are down. I don't know, maybe both. Boys, hold her down. What? What are you talking about? What are you doing? I need to close up your leg, and it's gonna hurt. No! You're not a doctor. No, I'm not, you're right. But if I don't, you'll bleed to death. No, get her away from me! I want an ambulance! There are no ambulances, okay? There's no phones, and there's no vehicles. I don't care. Get her away from me! Jenny, listen! Listen to me. If I don't stitch this up, you'll die. Do you hear me? You'll die. She's right. You're losing too much blood. Hold her. I can't believe this is happening. Hey, hey guys. We still got power. Damage is severe in many areas as far inland as Santa Monica, where houses and buildings have all been washed away. Rescue efforts have been hampered by power outages all along the coast. Casualties are estimated to be in the hundreds. Will it leave a scar? A tiny one. Ow! Look, boss, face it. There's nothing you can do for her. I gotta find a way out there. See if she's alive. It's too risky. The rescue crew will come by. There's no rescue crew coming for us. We're on our own. Hold her. How many of those sharks do you think are out there? I saw four or five of them. One was big. Really big. The water keeps rising. We can't stay here. I mean, there's no telling when another wave might hit. Without a boat, we don't stand a chance. Can't one of us swim back to shore and get a boat? Look, you don't get it. Okay, these things are big, and they're fast. They caught up to our jet ski. Come on, that's not possible. Is it? There's a flare gun around here somewhere. In the cupboard below. There's an inflatable raft there as well. Can't we use that to get back to shore? A little raft won't stand a chance against those sharks. Get the flare to at least let someone know we're here. Yeah. There's no telling how far the wave washed that cupboard. Hold her. Hang in there. How does a prehistoric shark like this end up on the coast of Malibu? I mean, is that possible? I don't know, maybe the tsunami shook something up. Should I help? See if you can ring someone. This is Malibu Lifeguard Station 23. We have an emergency. This is Malibu Lifeguard Station 23. Dispatch, can you respond? In complete devastation, the damage has spread from San Francisco to San Diego. The Governor has declared a state of emergency. This is Malibu Lifeguard Station 23. Does anybody read me? Malibu Lifeguard Station 23. Anybody? They'll come for us, won't they? They won't even know we're here. They'll assume we evacuated like everybody else. This thing's big. Right up the coast of Northern California. which means rescue parties are gonna be few and far between. Appealing for calm, the Governor offered hope, announcing the entire coast has now been designated a disaster area. Speaking from a rescue chopper heading for the coast, he told those in distress, that National Guard troops, the Coast Guard and FEMA, are mobilizing immediate rescue and relief operations. And that hospitals as far away as Las Vegas are preparing to accept thousands of casualties. Experts say the sloping coast of Malibu may have contributed to the area being the hardest hit. Oh, there, that's it. All done. My father will wanna sue the city of Malibu for putting me at risk. Yeah, with a bit of luck, all the lawyers will have drowned. How you feeling? Like I stuck my leg in a blender. You did good, kid. How does it look? I can't even tell it's there. It's good. Oh, geez! What have you done to me? Well, under the circumstances, the best that I could. Look at my leg! Hey, she just saved your life. I'm sorry, it's just… I look like Frankenstein. Oh, I think it'd take a little more than this. All I got are my looks, you know. That's not true. I'll never be able to wear a bikini. Sure, you will. A little plastic surgery, you'll be fine. You're gonna have to bandage this up. Main thing is gonna be trying to keep it dry. Okay, I'm gonna bandage it now. I need some plastic, to keep it dry. Barb. Yeah? I need you to tell me about those sharks. I mean, I don't know much. I can remember they're from a Lamniforme. Excuse me? Same species as a great white. Okay. What about their eyes? They look like they're blind. They probably are. I mean, at the depths that they used to live at… Apparently still do, there's no light. They use sound waves and movement to track their prey. What do you mean, like bats? Similar. They have electro sensory organs in their long snouts. Wow. Like radar. Perfect. Yeah. Unless you're the one they're chasing. Yeah, for sure. Okay, so do you guys have any other weapons here? I got six shots left. Yeah. We got these. And you figure to kill these sharks before they get in here, right? I don't know why we assume we have to kill them. Look, as long as they're out there, we're safe in here, right? Yeah, as long as they're out there. No problem. All right. Look. I can't tell you how important this could be. A species of shark that hasn't been seen on this earth for millions of years. It's astounding. If we can somehow capture it, I mean, the evolutionary data that could be generated, the pure science of it. I mean, just what if there's something else down there? Look, Barb. Nobody wants to make this species extinct. Okay, but right now, look, we're just talking about survival of the fittest. He's right, Barb. Okay? Bryan! I understand their attitude, but I kinda need your support. Look, I support you always. I just don't want anything to happen to you. Nobody understands the importance of this. Oh, God. How long are they gonna keep this up for? They think we're food. They can hear us, sense our movements. The blood. You okay? Yeah? It's gonna be okay. We're gonna get through this. Yeah? - Yeah. I'm sorry about before. I love you. I love you too. Okay. Better show me how to use one of these things. All right, come here. No, no, no, no! Barb, no, no! Hey, she's gone. Hey, hey. She's gone. She's gone. She's gone. Heather. Heather! We gotta cover that hole. Help me move the cabinet. Come on. We can't hide here forever. We'll have to fight them off. I think we should make a swing for it. I can look after Jenny, you can take Bryan. No. No, we wouldn't stand a chance against those sharks. They outran a jet ski. We can't just wait here and let them pick us off one by one. Okay. So we'd make a stand here and kill it. Don't touch me. She would want you to fight to survive, Bryan. No. Don't tell me what Barbara would want, okay? She wanted us to try and save these sharks. And now she's dead. Shh, shh, it's gonna be okay. We'll get you through this. No, don't patronize me, all right? These aren't ordinary sharks. They're never going to give up. They're going to kill us all. They will if you don't shut up. We're all tired here, so you might as well sit down and shut up. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Relax. We need more weight! We need more weight, we need more weight. Bryan, help us get on, we need more weight. Bryan, get on, we need more weight. George, throw the tools over here. Where's Karl and Yancey? Around the back, I think. You could just wait it out. You know, you don't have to do this. I can make that easy. You know I'm the better swimmer. All right, listen. You just be careful. You find a boat, you bring it straight back, okay? Yeah. All right. It'll be okay. All right. Good luck. Okay. Shark, shark, shark! Yancey, shark! Shark! Yancey! Yancey! Shark! What? Shark! Yancey, shark! Oh, God, no! What the hell's going on? She was swimming for the shore. What? The shark! It killed her! She's dead! Hey, hey, hey, hey! There's nothing we can do now. Come on. Just give me a minute. Karl? Help me! Karl! No, no, no, no! He's gone. He's gone! Let him go. George, let's get back inside. George! Back inside. Hey look, this is it. Okay? Now, we're gonna lift this thing up, and we'll really kill it. God. Heather, go! Get the spear right now. Bryan, go! Bryan, go! Come on. And when I lift it up, start firing! You ready? Don't, don't, you freak! We'll all die! Get away from it! Please, focus! Jenny, calm down! It's gonna be all right, calm down. Please, just stay here, and I promise it'll be okay. Barb was taken by surprise. That's not gonna happen again. I promise. We're ready for this. Okay. Get ready… Get that, get it down. Get it down, get it down! Was that it? Is that the one? I'm outta ammo. I know. Do we have any more? Yeah, in the cupboard below. Okay, well, at least we had an experience. There's still more of them. Can't we kill them all? We're gonna need more bullets. Yeah. Yeah. Think it works? I think so. When we heard about the tsunami, I wanted to get in the car and go. But she wanted to stay and help out. I just loved her so much, you know? She loved you too. A lot. Remember that. All I can remember is her being torn apart. You can't. You can't. Don't do it. Don't dwell on that. Don't. Heather. Jenny. Come here. It's just a branch. The sea's full of junk. All right, the way I see it- Shh, shh, shh, shh. They're gonna tear this place apart, bit by bit. I'm gonna go down and see if I can get the flare gun. No, no, you'll never make it. I'll make it. I might find some dry ammo down there. Don't do it, it's not worth it. They're not here anymore. They're out there somewhere. Look, you don't even know that. And we have no idea where the cupboard went. Nobody knows we're out here. Heather's right. If there's another flare, they might send a boat for us or something. They'll get you before you even get close. Whatever happens, promise me you guys won't leave me here. Nobody stays behind. Nobody. Thank you. It's not much gas. Break her up and see if she runs. I think we got water in the fuel line. Ah, we'll have to break it down. You go see if you can find a can of gas out there somewhere. Sure, boss. I'll go. What? Forget it, it's my idea. Yeah, well, I'm still in charge, right? So I'm going. You wanna fight about it? Let him go. You can out-swim anyone above water. But, underwater, Pete's the man. Nobody I've ever known can hold their breath for as long as he can. Let him go. I don't like it. I'm not asking you to like it. What I'm asking you to do is keep an eye on things up here while I'm gone. You think you can trust me for five minutes? Yeah, I think you can handle it. You owe me. Yeah. We'll keep watch. We'll distract them, we'll tap on the floor. North, south. Doug and I will take east and west. Okay. Let's do this. Bryan, I need your help, okay? I need you to help me, please. Okay. How long can he hold his breath? A long time. It's not gonna be a worry, he's a Navy SEAL. No gas. Got washed away. Ah. You got the gelignite. Yeah. I figure it'd be better than going out there with nothing but good intentions. Good idea. We're not going to shore. Not straight away. What do you mean not straight away? Colin, we don't have enough gas. They need our help. We'll send somebody back for 'em It might be too late. There are sharks out there, and that shack is half submerged. You're taking a big chance, you saw what happened to Karl. I'm going out there, with or without you. The way I see it, half this boat is mine. I found it. And I fixed it. And I'm taking my half out there. And you do what you want with yours. Shark! Pete. Pete. Come on, Pete. Quick, let's distract them. Over here, let's go. Hey! Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Quick! I had to use the flare on the shark. My god. Hey, did you miss me? Yeah, I did. It's okay. They're here! We're not gonna make it. I told you, we're not gonna make it. Stop it! Stop it, yes we are! Why don't you stop it! Okay, listen! This is what we're gonna do. We're gonna move to the roof. Doug, I need to go first. You lift Jenny up to me, okay? Okay, okay. Pete. Wait. One, two, three. Never thought I'd be happy to see your face. Where's Heather? She's underneath with the others. Looks like we got a ride. Doug, help everyone up. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Easy, watch your legs. Come on. She needs to get to a hospital. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, it's okay. You okay? Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. I wasn't gonna leave here without you. Thank you so much for coming. Hurry! I can't hold it much longer! Come on, everyone in the boat. Come on, come on. You all right? - Yeah. Okay, come on, let's go. We're out of fuel. You sure? I told you this would happen. All right guys, listen up. We're gonna have to drift in, okay? As the sun sets on this indescribable day of death and destruction, evidence of the tragedy continues to wash up on the shore all around us. We can take some solace in the quick response of authorities. Up and down the coast now, the rescue effort is well underway. Military and civilian helicopters are shuttling the injured to first aid stations inland, meanwhile buses are taking the stranded to disaster relief centers. Further south, San Diego fire and rescue are estimating the death hole in that city at 850 and climbing. But they are also crediting early warning with saving thousands of lives. Stop it, stop it. You guys, grab an oar. Get us off this thing. You better be quick 'cause we're taking on water. Okay. We got about 25 feet to go. We're gonna have to swim for it. No, I've lost already two guys to these sharks. Well, what other option do we… George! - George, what are you doing? Shh, keep it down! George! I'm gonna open the gate. Go quick. Oh, God. I'll get some cutters. Hurry up. Shark! Look out. - Bryan! - What are you doing? Wait! No! No! No, Bryan, no! I'll distract it. No! No. Doug, hand me the anchor. We're not leaving him. We're not leaving him. Stop! We can't leave him. Go, go, come on! Grab her! No, don't! Get outta here! Shh, shh. Okay, okay. Come on, just a little more to go. Right here. We'll find you on the inside! Do you think it's gone? Come on! Get in the car! Come on, come on, come on! Come on, come on. You're okay, you're okay, you're okay. This way. What… Hey. You okay? You? I'm still breathing. Let's keep it that way. You think they made it? I hope so. Come on. Oh! Sorry. There's bottled water somewhere. Will I get an infection? Sea water shouldn't be so bad, but this place is pretty filthy. We'll have you outta here before you need to worry. Okay? Here. We'll need to find the others. I need to find a ladder up to the next floor. Once we have a safe haven, we can talk them up to us. It's the safest way. It's down that way. Two rooms away. Hope it survived the wave. I'll stay with Jenny. I won't be long. I've heard stories of sharks being able to come up om dry land and get people. Can they do that? Only if they wear sneakers. Funny. Shark! Shark! Shark! Shark coming! Shark's coming! Shark coming! Here, take this. Hold that, hold that. All right. Oh my god. Colin! Watch out, it's coming back! I got him! That one's dead. I'm going to look for the ladder now. There's a tool shed over there. I can find something to fight it off. You won't make it. Bang on the side of this thing. When it comes, I'll slip out the other side. Okay? Wait, wait. Come here. What if we don't make it? What are we- If we don't… What about Colin? If he were here right now, I'd kiss him too. When we get outta here, I'm gonna marry you. You've said that before. Yeah, but this time I mean it. I love you. I love you too. Just about everything. Yeah, I'm sorry. And I'll change. What if I love you both? I'll get rid of him later. When you bang on the side, let it come over here. Be careful. Be right back. Over here! Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Let's go. Are you okay? Come on. You okay? Yeah. You risked your life for me. That's what I get paid for. Is that the only reason? What? You want me to tell you I like you? Only if you really do. Okay, I like you. So what? So, nothing. Colin. Colin! Doug, Jenny, where are you? Here! Over here! When you come to the junction, take a right, you'll find me. George, are you with them? I'll tell him myself. Just hold on, we're coming. Where's George? Hold on, we're coming. Colin. I'm so sorry. What happened? There was a shark in the parking lot. Got to him before we arrived. Look, I'm really sorry, man. You know, for what it's worth… I gutted that shark. We should've helped, for sure. No, they would've got us. How can you be sure? Oh, look, we can play the blame game later. Where's Jenny and Doug? Are they okay? They're in the storage area, back that way. I killed another one. Is there any more out there? I don't think so. Yet. Okay. So, how do we get outta the water? Find the ladder that used to go up there. We gonna have a problem, you and I? I'd say so, yeah. I can make her happy. Yeah, so can I. You had your chance. Well, people have troubles. Doesn't mean they gotta bust up. No. But she's ready to move on. We'll see. For now, why don't we just concentrate on keeping her alive. I'm up for that.
