Hi, honey. Hi. I'm sorry. Dr. Shapiro to Radiology. Dr. Shapiro, please report to Radiology. Hey, Joel. I'm Les, man. Pleasure. Sorry I'm late, man. Man, these people around me got me running around like a dog. Broke your neck, huh? I was hoping no one would notice. That halo's a dead giveaway, man. How'd it happen? Hiking accident. Damn. Out enjoying nature. So what you do for a living, Joel? I'm a writer. Is that right? I'm a Stephen King man myself. You like him? He's fast. Yeah. He's something else, man. You got your hands? It's all right. Don't sweat it. They got computers, right? You can type with your tongue. I'll be right back, man. I am! I am! I am! Les, I am! Les, Vernon is calling you. Yeah, thanks a lot. I ought to teach him your name. Joel, this is Rosa. Rosa, this is Joel. Hi, Joel. The way it works here is, she's got the certificate, but I really do all the work. Don't listen. He's always complaining. Just stating the facts, ma'am. Just stating the facts. I am. Mr. Gibson, hope they had you up walking. Oh, you know they did. Victor! Flirting in front of your wife! Shame on you. Um, everybody, say hello to Joel. He'll be with us for a while. I am! The guy almost kills me, and he sends me fucking candy! They look really expensive. Did you see the card? The card is really nice. Mom, what do you want me to do? Send him a fucking thank-you note? Les, I am! I'm here, Vernon. Don't worry about that. You'll get used to it. I'll go get your bed. Les! Look, I just want to talk to my woman. A man's got a right to talk to his woman? No, I don't want to hold! Shit! I am! I'm gonna fucking kill you, Vernon, if you don't shut up! I'll slap you if you don't shut up! He does it just to bother me, Mom. Rosa, we gotta do something. I can't even call my woman. I know, Raymond.It's frustrating! Rosa! I need you in 57. Right now. Just a second. If you need anything, just holler, okay? I'll be back. Mom, I'm interested in your stories, okay? I am! I am! - I know, Bloss. - I'm keeping up, okay? Putting you through. It's about time. What you doing? Playing dominoes? There's no need for sarcasm, sir. I am! Signorelli's Pizza. Gotta put you on hold. Now, this is ridiculous. Look, did you get the lawyer? I tried, Bloss, but I couldn't get that Rhonda off the phone today. Did you know she's going out with Arthur again? Yeah, Mom, you told me. I did? I told you? She's sleeping with an army a week, and she's still leading the man on. Look, we've got to get this lawyer thing arranged. Les! I swear to God, Vernon! Got you in the halo, huh? Man, I call that thing a crown of thorns. I thought they was gonna screw that thing into my brain. How you doing? My name is Raymond Hill. My friends call me Ray. Joel. Nice to meet you, Joel. Oh, this here? A crazy man chewed it off in a fight. But that was in my lawless days. If you need anything, a glass of water, something from the snack bar you just call on me, okay? Thanks. All right. It's a hard knock, isn't it, buddy? Yeah. One thing you got to remember through it all is that God got his plan. Now, take me for instance. I mean, I got a wife, a beautiful child. I was treating them bad, you know lying, cheating, drinking. God's just slowing me down so I can appreciate them. You know what I mean? I am, Les. Goddamn! Pile of brain sludge! Les. That was not nice. I should get you out of bed and make you apologize to that poor man. Hey! There you are! How you doing? Raymond Hill. My friends call me Ray. Hi, I'm Anna. It's nice to meet you, Anna. You two are married, huh? No, we're friends. Excuse me, I saw the ring and I just...I'm married. You are?Heh. Right, right. How is Donald? David. His name is David. Oh, I got you. Raymond Hill understands these matters. You're a lucky man there, Joel. Very perceptive guy.Yeah. Friends, huh? Well, I like you. I'm back, gentlemen. And boy did we miss you, nursey. I love you too, Bloss. We'll have that bed in five minutes. I won't move. Mr. Gibson. Ready to get in bed?Oh, you know I am. All right, let's do it. I went over some chapters, but you don't wanna start back so soon. There's not much else to do. I brought you... these. Uh, kind of quiet in here, isn't it? Oh, boy, unusual. Yeah. Unh! Very unusual. Ah. I'll be right back. Thanks. Come on. Pulse! He's back. Okay, respiration spontaneous. Let's get him to ICU. What are you thinking? Did you tell Donald? David? Yeah, of course I did. I mean about us. I'm going to. I should go. It's late. Okay? Good night. Anna.Hmm? You seem to be taking all this rather well. Sleep well. If he dies, there could be murder charges. Then we'd be called in as witnesses. Bullshit! It's not bullshit. You know this hospital's concerned about... Take care, beautiful. Good night. At least manslaughter. Shut up, Raymond. I'm just postulating. Do me a favor, postulate in your own bed. Don't fucking snore! I think I should be more depressed than I am, but I'm not. That's... Why is that? My mom and my sister came to visit when I was in Intensive, but I was so high on morphine, I didn't really notice. I couldn't really tell who they were, which pretty much sums up my family, I guess. It's a nice sweater. Do all shrinks wear sweaters? I remember Judd Hirsch had a nice sweater in Ordinary People. I really rely mainly on my girlfriend in this. Yeah, she is nice. She's great. She's a great girl. Smart, funny. Unfortunately, she's married to someone else. Heh. That he does not know what's really going on it's really not my problem. He's her problem and she's my problem. And now there's this problem, so... What are you writing there? Uh, you know, I'm hopeful. Heh. I am. I'm hopeful. Oh, no, no. I'm anticipating the psychological crash. I have it penciled in already. I think it happens next week sometime. I'm a writer. That's what I do. And I don't need to walk to do that. So, uh... This is denial, right, doc? Hey, Victor, how are you doing? I have five months of this. Well, could be worse. Could be your cooking. I never cooked. I heated. How we doing, Mr. Gibson? All right.I figured that. How you doing, nurse? Here you go, Ray. Sorry, man, but that was the last extra one they had. You go with what the good lord gives you. Fish is pretty good, huh? You'll think so too after a few months. Macradenal. What about a painkiller? Later. Enjoy your fish. Oh, yeah. I almost forgot. Teatro de Kung Fu,right? Wait a minute, man. Come on, Bloss, man. Every time we vote on this stuff, it always ends up the same way. Oh, yeah? If you haven't noticed, there's another patient. Not to mention one less Mexican. Why don't we take another vote? All right, if you want to vote, we vote. We already know your vote. Victor, we know your vote. Mr. Gibson, what do you say? You know me. Whatever's on is all right with me. All right. Fair enough. Ray, what you say? Don't like football and I don't like kung fu. So we got three abstentions. We got one kung fu. We got one football. Joel. It's on you, man. I'll just give my vote to you, Les. Great, we're gonna have to flip a coin. A coin, my ass! We gotta stick together on this thing. Look, I don't really watch TV, man. I ain't about TV, man. It's about football, man. Motherfucking Raiders! Listen. Around here, you and me, we gotta stick together. What are you talking about? I'm talking about not letting these niggers and spics take over this room. My last name is Garcia, Bloss. Joel Garcia. Come on, big guy, call it. You should channel this hostility in a more positive direction. You're a little prick, you know that, man? Come on, Bloss. Heads or tails, man? Heads. Tails it is, man. Garcia? Garcia? Oh, boy, that's deep. That is deep. I am. Guess who's in the private room? I am! Here we go. Mm-hm. Ready to roll. I'm gonna have to buy me one of those vans with a lift. All right. Okay. You clear over there?Yeah, I'm good. Are you okay?Yes. All right.I'm fine. Whoo... Okay, we got it in there. Cheryl, get him under the chair. I've got him. Oh, this is...Now. He looks a little pale.Are you okay? Maybe a little dizzy but... Get that chair under him, Cheryl! It's nothing to worry... Here we go. There he goes. Joel? Joel? Here he is. Uh, better wait on that van. Mm-hm. Make way, Harley! Woo, you're so pitiful! Fuck you! You know you're so pitiful! Shut the fuck up! What's the matter? You running out of gas? Uh-oh. Come on, I'm gonna wait for you. Come on, baby! Harley-Davidson ain't shit compared to a Cadillac! Fuck you, motherfucker! Can I help you? Yeah. Hello. Hello? I've been waiting for about 10 minutes. That's just the way things are. Please hold. Wait, wait! No, no. Forget it. Hey there, Mr. Gibson! How you doing? Fine.Wonderful, wonderful. How are you? Hey. Psych. Hey. Won't be too long now before the new bambinois here, huh? That's wonderful, wonderful. I got a little girl, Starletta. Beautiful child. That's a picture of her. Les! Rosa, why don't you go see what Vernon wants? It's not my name he's calling. Les! What's wrong with him, anyway? Broken neck, a head injury, heh, kind of cut his vocabulary to a minimum. Les! Look, I'll be right back. Look, man. I'm all wet again. You know, gizmo done busted. Give me five minutes. Okay, Ray? Okay. Okay. Hey. How you doing there, halo-head? So you're a writer, huh? Some people think so. Yeah? Well, that's great! That's great! Raymond Hill is a man of many stories. True things. Make your asshole go tight. See, I was settled down when this happened to me. I was on my way to buy cigarettes. Two guys jump me, beat me and throw me in the L.A. River. Joel, ain't no water in that river. I mean, I have to admit I was kind of wild, kind of crazy. Take this for instance. Now, you see this? An asshole chopped it off with a straight razor. I thought a crazy man chewed... Joel, you got to watch those women. They soul-stealers. Now, let's take that one you got. She a pretty one, but she's a soul-stealer. And no matter what happens, part of your soul is gonna be gone, so you might as well be glad to give it up. You know, I do remember that I had one woman like that once. Oh, she was a beauty. White woman. Name was Annabelle Lee. Stripper. Three weeks in a tiny little bed in a tiny little room. Ray, what do we gotta do, man? We gotta listen to your stories all day and night? Just mind your business. We're talking. You're talking! He's being polite while you tell him lies. What lies? Lies, man! Just shut up! You know, Bloss, I'll tell you something. It don't matter if you keep your mind closed. That's okay. But it concerns me when you libel my good name. I'll do more than libel your name. You know this man's got a problem with race. I told him it's nothing but ignorance and fear. That's all it is. You're a writer, tell him. Ignorance and fear. Fuck you! Or it could just be a zinc deficiency. That's exactly what I was gonna say! I told that man, I said the black man know how to please a white woman. Where is this white woman if she's in love with you? I don't know where she is, bumblehead! Oh, yeah. Mr. Bigshit with all the women, man. Your wife don't even visit you, homey. I tell you what. Just to shut you the fuck up, I'll wager good money this white bitch don't even exist except in your black head. Mm-hm. Fantasy Island, motherfucker. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right. All that money that you're supposed to make from your lawsuit? Heh. Money that you couldn't match. I'll match anything you put down. Come on, you two. What do you want, man? Come on with it. Come with it. Huh? Fifty bucks? That ain't shit! $100. Oh, $100, that's shit, man. Whatever you wanna bet, man. Just shut up. You got it. You got it. Rosa, you hear that. You're a witness. You leave me out of this. We got a bet. Yeah, we got a bet. Now you gotta prove yourself. Don't worry about it. I'll figure it out. You boys better not cause me any trouble. - Just tell him to shut up. - All right, man? Does any of these people go home around here, man? Rosa! Rosa! Thought you said they'd keep the hardcover graphics. I put in my two cents, but I don't run the place. It's a sexy picture of you, though. Before the haircut. Okay. Try the keyboard. They told me it's the softest touch. Okay. How does it feel? It feels... Heh. It feels great. Joel. I have to see him. I have to go home. Type. No. Type! Even though the spinal-cord patient can get a reflex erection it's not gonna feel the same. Orgasm, as you've known it, is very rare. You'll have to learn to experiment with your partner. Communicate. Learn what you like. Find out what they like. Oral sex comes in handy. Wait, wait. No, there ain't gonna be none of that. Did you say something, Raymond? Look, doc, I don't mean no disrespect, but a woman was put on this earth to serve a man. Now, that's just a biological fact. There are a few of us in this room, Raymond, who might argue that point. Doc, what you're saying to me is that you want me to eat some pussy. Now, black men don't eat pussy. What you going to do, Raymond? Use a straw? Maybe I'll use your big nappy head. That's what I'll do. It is your choice, Raymond, but I've been in this chair for 18 years... And you're saying you go down on a woman? Every chance I get, Raymond. That's disgusting. That's just absolutely disgusting. Dear Anna: I wish I could say all that needs to be said about us. From here, just now, I cannot. The halo is off, and for the first time since the fall I'm allowed the luxury of warm free water to cleanse me. Every third day at dawn, I'm showered. What a simple pleasure that is. Such a short time ago, that seems like forever, we lay in your tiny room in Santa Monica, not caring as the cool night melted into morning. Now's not the time to decide the future. I'm sorry for trying to force things. Time here has stopped. Visitors come and go, each face blending into the next, no face yours. Everyone tells me I look good. I smile, make jokes. They laugh, wish me well. They leave. I remain here. This place... They packed us in the van and took us to a football game the other day. We passed a strip joint, and Raymond told us therein danced his Annabelle Lee. Bloss called him a liar. I'm convinced that in a perfect world those two men would be lovers. My wild, optimistic imagination. Anna, three weeks without you seems such a long time, especially now. But I understand nothing is easy. You'll be back soon. We'll play Scrabble. We will find the words. Love, Joel. What? The keys to the van. I hope you trust my driving, because tonight I'm you taking out to eat some crow. You're on, man. Is there a dead dog in here somewhere? Hey. What is this? Who let this lowlife element in here? Calm yourself down! I got family coming today. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Shut the fuck up! Drinking is against the rules! Fucking crazy nigger. Thinks he's the fucking mayor of the hospital. I got some presents for you.What? This one's name is Lucille. Give him a kiss, Lucille. You kidding me! I'll be fucking rolling in the money. First thing I'm gonna do, I'm gonna buy Mom a new house. Then I'm gonna get myself a fucking Harley with a lift on it. What's the deal with the dude? You know, the money guy? I don't know. Let's give him a call. Number's in the top drawer. Give me the phone. It'll be fun. Give him a call. This must be it. Give him a piece of your mind, man. Operator.Give me 555-9030. - All my lines are busy. - Please hold. I ain't got all day to wait, motherfucker! I'm trying to sleep, this guy's got this Asian woman walking on his back. Wait a minute. Here he is, man. How you doing, Mr. Rader? Fine. Who is this? It don't matter who this is, man. It's the fucking L.A. Times,man. Who is this? You care to comment on this $2.5 million lawsuit you got going, huh? Make you think twice before you run over innocent people in your Mercedes-Benz, huh? Don't you hang up on me, motherfucker! You got him running scared, bro. Don't forget who your friends are when you're a rich man. What the fuck are you looking at, Garcia? You want a beer, bro? Raymond? Hey, Rachel! Baby, I was watching for you to come in over there. I parked on the other side. Girl, you know you look good. Boy, you look good! Starletta, how you doing, baby? Look what Daddy's got for you. Come on, give your father a kiss. I need to sit down, Raymond. Starletta wants a Coke. All right. Well, we'll just go into the snack bar. Come on, girl. Now, Rachel... baby, I get out of here in two months. I mean, a woman needs a man. A child needs a father. Please, Raymond. Baby, I devote my life to you. Now, you... I mean, besides, who's gonna take care of you anyway? Look, Raymond, I'm doing fine. I've always done fine. Yeah, I know that, and I know I've treated you bad in the past. But the past is the past. I don't wanna go through this again. Just do this for me, okay? Rachel, we are a family. Heh. I'm not gonna divorce my family. You're just making this hard on me. Rachel, we are a family. And I can't divorce my family! I've gotta go. Wait, wait. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. Baby, I give you God's love, if you just give me a chance. I mean, I'm a changed man. I ain't the way I used to be. Come on, Starletta. You can't walk out of here like this. Tell your daddy thank you for the Coke. Thank you for the Coke. You're welcome, baby. Don't do that. Rachel... Rachel! You're my wife! You're supposed to be at my side! Rachel! They asked her to take this stuff out of here. That's not right. I'll ask Cheryl Lynn to help you, okay? What time? Time for what? Annabelle Lee. There ain't no Annabelle Lee. We got a bet or what, man? Forget the bet, forget the trip and just leave me be, okay? Get that cigar out of here, Bloss. You know the rules. Here's the motherfuckers that won't put our calls through. Hey! Hey in there! Bring your asses out here! I wanna make a complaint! Hey, goddamn it! I know you hear me! Probably sitting on your butts like you usually do! Bring your asses out here! Get your hands off of me! Don't you know you're fucking with people's lives? Squeaky-voice motherfuckers, maybe I'll break your fucking neck! You all right?No, I'm not all right! He was handing them the money, and they shot him. Poor kid. Right there in his father's store. Fucking punks, man. Mom! Come on, cut the fingernails, not my fingertips. You're such a baby. "Worms" and "snoot." Four, five, six, nine, 10, 11, 12... Sixteen. I loved your letter.Oh? Well... Why didn't you write me back? I can't write. You know that. Maybe you were afraid of what you might say. Anna, don't. Is this okay? Yeah. What's your name, man? My name's Sang. I'm Bloss. Listen, man, if you need anything around here, you know, anything at all, you let me know, okay? I mean that. You play tennis, man? Give me the juice, Mom. Knock, knock. Medication time. Just a minute. Hold on. Okay. Oh, Jesus! Hope I'm not interrupting anything. Um... Here. Thanks. Hmm. He refuses to learn his bowel program. Me and Rosa had to spend all last week trying to get him on that toilet. Cheryl Lynn says he won't even dress himself in the morning. It's not our problem the nigger won't dress himself or dig his own shit. When his day comes, he's out of here. Tell him that. I already did. Rosa! Just adorable. Well, good night. Good night. You still like me? You're okay. Anna? Do you have a minute? Sure. Um, we understand the patient's need for sex therapy... but on the ward, the other patients tend to feel left out. Of course. Then there's something about insurance which even I can't figure out. If it were up to me, I'd change the rules. I understand your dilemma. I'm sorry to embarrass you. I mean, y-yes. Middle button. Hey. Here we go. Back in the gimp palace. All you gimps, you cripples! She grabs me... Can I still get it up? Shit, yeah, I can get it up. I'm Raymond Hill! Got plenty of women! Women all across the country. Shoot. Ask me if I don't know what I'm doing. I... I'm gonna call her right now and tell her to come over and sit right over me in this chair. Hey, Rosa! Rosa Carmelita Rodriguez Concepción! Why the hell y'all got so many damn names? Damn. A family. Every man... A daughter needs a father. Rosa! Rosa! Shit! Jesus Christ, Ray. What the hell are you trying to do? What does it look like I'm trying to do? I'm trying to get to bed. It's all right. It's okay. I'll get up there myself. I don't give a shit! It ain't nothing but a goddamned statistic around here, anyway. All the people in here is prejudiced. Shh. Quiet. All of them is prejudiced. Where's Rosa at? She was supposed to give me... You've been drinking, Ray.I ain't been drinking! You've been drinking, and you know the rules! I, uh, you're supposed to be my friend. I ain't gonna let you libel my name. Get off of me! Where's the supervisor? Supervisor!People are asleep, Ray. Sleeping? Oh. Hey. Hey. Halo. - He can't hear you, Ray. - He's sleeping. I'm sorry I woke you up. He's sleeping. Motherfucker! I went out and got some women! Hey, Bloss, I saw Annabelle. I saw Annabelle, Bloss. Okay, just keep quiet. You'll be all right. You'll be all right. Call my wife.We'll call her in the morning. No, you got to. I wanna talk to Starletta. She need a father. I ain't gonna be nothing without no family. If I can't have my family, what'll I be? It's gonna be all right. You just relax. Get my wife on the phone. Just go to sleep. Ain't got my family, what'll I be? We'll call them in the morning. So they're just gonna dump this guy on the highway with 20 bucks and a new leg bag and say, "Good luck, Raymond"?Yep. I'd feel sorry for him, but I'm saving up all my pity for myself. You haven't used any yet?That much. Sorry it took so long. You two have fun today. Thanks. So long, saps!Heh. I bought you this tape, didn't I? On our third date. I already had the CD, by the way. I never told you that. Huh? Obviously, I was not thinking too clearly. Half a year of those looks in the office. I never gave you looks. Oh, now, you gave me looks. You gave me looks!You gave me looks. Uh, oops. A wind!You fucker! A wind. It blew out of my hand. It blew it out of my hand. I hate you.I'll buy you another one. Oh. Good choice.Joel. It's romantic. Now, you were heading...? I was heading this way, east. And, um, he was coming up Brower, heading north. And? I went through the intersection. Roughly how fast were you going? Mr. Dorsinski?What? About how fast were you going? I don't know. About 30, 35. You all right, Bloss?I'm fine, Mom. So he crossed through and hit you in the intersection? That's what I said, didn't I? Look, can we talk about this in a restaurant? I gotta find a bathroom. What? I want to look at you. Joel, I'm shy. Heh. Let me. Please. What's wrong? It's wet. Shit, my gizmo slipped! It's okay. Damn! It's not okay! It's fucked! Hey, we have another one. We'll clean it up, okay? It's only a little wet.I got it. It's no big deal. Okay? It's okay. I might go again. I never know when I'll go.We'll put another one on. Then what? It's not worth it. Just forget it. Fuck it! I don't feel anything anyway. Can we just forget it, all right? Oh. Isn't she beautiful? Isn't she beautiful? Oh, she looks just like you, Victor. Let's go to Daddy. Let's go to Daddy. Watch the head. Mom, if he's a lawyer, he should be able to answer our questions. He probably has to talk to Mr. Sparks first. Who's Mr. Sparks? You know, the guy on TV. Larry Sparks. Mom... You're telling me that you got these bozos off the TV?Yeah. Mom, that's just plain stupid! No, it's not. This is a respectable firm. It's stupid, Mom! Bloss, you know, I think you're upset. It's because you went back too soon. I told you it was too soon. Don't get on me about it. Leave me alone. And don't make it my fault. Howdy, partner! Who the fuck is that? Hope you're ready for a little entertainment. ♪ And take a couple A square through ♪ ♪ Go four hands It's what you do ♪ ♪ Do-si-do With a corner girl ♪ ♪ Make an ocean wave ♪ ♪ Swing through ♪ ♪ Men run around that girl ♪ Heh, heh. ♪ That wheelin' deal ♪ ♪ Get out and lift With a corner girl ♪ ♪ And a left, round you Round that whirl and... ♪ ♪ Meet a girl That's pretty little low ♪ ♪ And promenade Your lady fair ♪ ♪ Take a little walk Around the square ♪ ♪ And join hands ♪ ♪ Make 'em ring And circle a little left ♪ ♪ With a pretty little ding ♪ ♪ Circle left Go around you go and... ♪ Fucking square dancers in my room!

Boy, you do know how to trash a place. Here, have a taste. Look, it's unhealthy to drink alone. It's better to drink with a partner. Even if it has to be you. Fuck you, man. Look at that. Why you gonna wipe it off? That's just so childish. My sister used to do that. Probably with good reason, man.It is childish! Oh, yes. What the fuck is this shit? Here, give me that. Go ahead, have another one. Don't mind me. You know, Bloss, I've been thinking... If a man wanna snuff it, bam! Aim his chair into traffic, squish! Huh? But you got to time it right. Got to pick the right car. Like a Cadillac. Mm-hm. Oh, no, no, no. A bus. Now, a bus will squish you real good. So do it, man. Oh, shit! If I was one of them total quads, then... Man, they can't even raise their hands. You know, they can't even slug a man. I mean, goddamn, even a quad need to slug a man sometime. Fucking Joel, man. I hate that motherfucker. You're just jealous, that's all. You're just jealous because he got a woman and he know his place. Every man got to find his place, Bloss. When are we going out again? I'll have to check my calendar. Come on, Joel, I had a good time. Really. Hey, we saw a movie. Heh, we saw a bad, bad, bad movie. We had dinner. Dinner was okay. All right, heh, the whole day was fucked. I'm just gonna go inside. I'll be all right. Are you sure?Yeah. Okay.Good night. Good night. I love you. Howdy, partner! Missed you at the hoedown. Next time, huh? So long. Good night. Bye. Vernon's wife. You give up?Yeah, well , fuck you! No, fuck that. Give up!Kick your ass, man. So when you gonna pay up that bet, man? Ain't that some shit. Mr. Lawsuit here... ...worrying his ass about $100. Will you stop? Ha, ha. No, it's the principle, man. Don't worry. She's there. You can guarantee it, ha, ha. She's there! One hand! One hand, motherfucker! One hand! Oh! Ha! We dumped. We fucked up, man. Oh, Lord, I sure hope somebody come along. Hey, Bloss. Did I tell you about my dream? Oh, heh, no. Don't tell me about your dream. Oh, it'll freak you out. I'm on this lake. And I'm standing up. No chair, man. Sky a beautiful blue all around me. And I'm standing on the water. But I'm dancing, see? That's the only way I can stay up is do this dance. And I know that as soon, as soon as I quit, forget it, that's it. I'm going down. I can't swim. No land for miles around. So I keep doing this dance. And I get tired. I keep doing this dance. Tired of doing that dance. I get tired. So tired. And then I wake up. Oh, man, freaked me out. Help! Help! I stitched it up for you, man. It's like new. It was pretty messed up. Listen, I want you to tell me something, man. And don't be stupid about it. Tell me what happened on the day that I dumped. What happened? Heh, the guy ran the light. He fucked you up. What really happened, man? I want you to tell me what really happened. I don't remember. Look, we were racing, man, just tooling around. Ugh, we were pretty blasted, but that don't make you blind. Damn, don't think about it, man. Here. No. Look, go to dinner, please. All right? I'm not gonna... No, I'm fine about it. I'll just get Florence to do it. It's her job. She gets paid for it. Look, if it's gonna make you happy, please, by all means, do it. I'm... I... Hey, I gotta go. If you wanna come, just come, all right? Bye-bye. Hey, uh... Got in a fight with your girlfriend. Ain't no big thing. Leave me alone, Bloss. Just trying to be friendly. What? I said I'm just trying to be friendly. Oh... Well, do me a favor, huh? Just leave me the fuck alone. Now you're showing some spirit, Joel. You know what your problem is, man? Hmm? You know what your problem is? You're determined to pick a fight, huh? Your problem is that you ain't got no problem. Look at you, man. Huh? You call yourself Garcia. You ain't no Mexican. You ain't no nigger. You ain't no white dude. You're better than everybody else. You and your fucking glasses, man. I got news for you, pal. How long will it take before that pretty girl leaves you for somebody who can tune her engine, huh? Are you done? No. No, I ain't. They're pretty good. I think they'd be better, heh, if they'd stop. But, uh... Oh, come on, please. Will you move sometime tonight?Heh. Hey, Rosa, can you give me a Darvadon? How about Percocel? No, how about, uh, Demoran? That's even better. Rosa, can you swing that?Morphine. You can shoot him up with some morphine. Bloss can get me some heroin. That'd be wild. Rosa, ask Bloss if he can score me some smack, huh? I'll get you a Darvadol. Hurry up, huh? You're an asshole, you know that? You're a hemorrhoid on an asshole. You're an inflamed hemorrhoid on a donkey's asshole. You're a cunt, heh. Why do I come here?What makes you say that? Heh, you called me a cunt. Whoa, you imply that I'm a drug addict. That was a joke! Come on. What is your problem? I broke my fucking neck!I know! You don't know! If any walking person knows, it's me, all right? Don't give me that shit! I think about it for two hours on the freeway and while I wash your clothes! I think about it while looking for accessible apartments! I'm sorry, all right? My heart really bleeds for you. Where's your laundry?You don't have to do it. I live for your laundry. I live to argue Scrabble rules with you. Really, it makes me whole. I love how your face brightens up when I walk in a room. I lost something too! You may not understand that, but it's true. You're out of shampoo. Love you. Enjoy the show? If it isn't Garcia, man. Señor Garcia to you. Hey, did you and Raymond ever settle that bet? What do you care?Maybe I want some of the action. Too late, Joel. Hey Joel, you wanna play? Come on, be a gimp, Joe. I hate badminton. Rosa! Rosa! Rosa! Hey, Vernon. Rosa? No. My name is Joel. Could you fix the TV, please? Sure. How's that? Good. I saw your wife, Vernon. She's very beautiful. Beautiful woman. It's hard, isn't it, Vern? Do you love her? My girlfriend, she touches me now, and I don't feel a thing. I feel like nothing. Like piss, shit. Like the smell of this place. It's... And I can't be nice to her. Sometimes I-I hate her. I feel this anger coming up inside me. and I lash out at her, but I don't mean to. I don't know. She's so good to me. I hate her for walking for feeling. If we live together when I get out... Oh, God, I can just see the pity in people's eyes. Falling over themselves to help me, or pretending not to see me, or pretending that nothing happened to me when it did. It did. I fell, Vernon. I... can't walk. God...damn. Oh! I'm sorry, baby. Oh, God. I'm sorry, Vern. Vern. What do you mean, an old-folks home? A place where they keep old people. He didn't have anywhere else to go. That's no piece of news to me. What about his wife? I just suppose it didn't work out. What, Bloss? You suddenly concerned about Raymond? He owes me money. Hm. Where is this place? What? I took the keys to the hospital van, Joel. How about we go on a field trip, settle this bet? You got room in your life for a little adventure. You drive. Why don't you drive? I don't have a license. I'll watch the door while you get dressed. I need you, Joel. Bloss, what you doing? I'm gonna go see some naked ladies, man. Live naked ladies? What'd you think, some dead naked ladies? What are you doing, man? Forget it. You ain't going.
