MS-1, go ahead. Activate the V-10 recorder. Copy. Quarter activation complete. Copy. Thank you. I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid. I mean, I do ordinary things. Eat ice cream. Ride my bike. I'm really good at playing sports. Well... on my Xbox. I love Minecraft, science and dressing up for Halloween. I love to lightsaber fight with my dad and watch Star Wars movies with him. And drive my big sister crazy. And dream about being in outer space, just like any ordinary kid. I just don't look ordinary when I'm doing these things. Not even my birth was ordinary. It was... hilarious. Now, how can a birth be hilarious, you ask? A teenage doctor helps. This is my first day. Nate! A massive video camera also aids the situation. But to really be funny, you need what all the bestjokes have: a punch line. He's coming! With the baby. Go with the baby. - Go, sir. - Go with the baby. I've had 27 surgeries since then. They've helped me to breathe, to see, to hear without a hearing aid, and some even helped me look a bit better. But none of them have made me look ordinary. He said he doesn't want to go. But he's ready. No, he's not ready. I cannot homeschool him forever. Every year that we wait, it'll just be harder to start. This is the first year of middle school for everyone. He will not be the only new kid. Okay, well, he's gonna be the only new kid that looks like him. Look, will you stop folding towels for just one second and please listen? It's like leading a lamb to the slaughter... and you know it. I know I'll neverjust be an ordinary kid. Ordinary kids don't make other kids run away from playgrounds. Ordinary kids don't get stared at wherever they go. But it's okay if you wanna stare too. My name is Auggie Pullman. Next week, I start fifth grade. And since I've never been to real school before... I'm pretty much totally and completely petrified. Mrs. Pullman, so good to see you again. And you must be Auggie. What a pleasure to meet you. I'm Mr. Tushman. You can laugh about that. Tushman. I've heard them all. Tushy. Butt-man. Butt-face. Mr. Tuchus. And then in the spring, we have a science fair. And from what your homeschool teacher tells me, you'll get first prize. You hear that, Auggie? Then right before graduation, whole class takes a trip to a nature reserve in Pennsylvania. It is the highlight of the year. I promise you. - So, I went to the... - Good, they're here. ...being in it was super fun. Who are they? Well, I thought it would be helpful for you to meet some of our students before you start school, Auggie. What do you think? Other kids now? They were in the elementary school so they know their way around... and they'll give you a nice tour. It will be fine. Auggie, this is Jack Will, Julian, and Charlotte. Guys, this is Auggie Pullman. - Hi. - Hi. Hey. Meeting kids is harder than meeting adults. Everyone makes the same face at first... but kids aren't as good at hiding it. So I usually look down. You can learn a lot about people from their shoes. I think these three are: trust fund kid, hand-me-down kid... Crazy kid. I act in TV commercials. Really? Yeah. Tide. Why don't you guys take Auggie around the school a bit. Just be back here in a half hour? I started when I was two. Local spots mostly. Then, when I was three, I booked my first national. Nestl√© Quik. It was hard, because I'm lactose intolerant. Anyway, have you ever heard of a spit bucket? So this is our homeroom. We have Mr. Browne. My mom says he's a little weird. Then I was in the chorus of the Radio City Music Hall Christmas Spectacular. I auditioned for Annie on Broadway. I got two callbacks for Molly, but I guess they went in a different direction. Hey, Charlotte? Don't you ever stop talking? So, this is the cafeteria. The food here is okay for school food. Or do you eat special food? This reminds me of my guest spot on Law & Order. So, the science elective is supposably really hard. So you probably won't be spending much time here. No offense, but if you've never been in a real school before... Dude, he's been homeschooled. Okay, I'm just saying. Science is supposably really hard. But you're taking it, too, right? Hey, maybe you could fail together. Why don't you get out of the way, so he can check it out? Okay. I mean, there's nothing much to see. Desks. Chairs. The incubator. Bunsen burners. Those are some really gross science posters. And this is an eraser. He knows what an eraser is. How am I supposed to know what he knows? He doesn't say anything. You know what an eraser is, right? Dude, you have to say something. Yeah, I know what an eraser is. Is... is your name Jack or Jack Will? Wait, you thought his name was Jack Will? Yeah, a lot of people call me by my first and last name. I don't know why. Got any other questions? Actually, I've got a question for Auggie. - What's the deal with your face? - Dude! I mean, were you in a car crash or something? - Julian! - What? Tushman said we could ask questions if we wanted to. Not rude questions. Besides, he was born like that, Mr. Tushman said. Yeah, I know. I just thought maybe he was, like, in a fire, too. Hey, Julian, shut up. - You shut up! - Why don't we all shut up? No, I wasn't in a fire. And the word's "supposedly." What? You said that science is "supposably really hard." Twice. The word's "supposedly." With a "D." Maybe my mom can homeschool you, too. Do you wanna tell us yet how you felt about the tour today? Mr. Tushman went out of his way to tell me how sweet those kids were and that Julian is apparently quite the dream. No. Not a dream? Is he one of those kids that acts one way in front of grownups and then another way in front of kids? Yeah, I guess. Well, I know it's hard, but you have to understand that he probably feels badly about himself. And when someone acts small, you just have to be the bigger person, all right? - Right. - Right. Via, I'll get the pizza. Can you get the trivet? Look at me, Auggie. That kid sounds like a real jerk. If somebody pushes you, you push back. Don't be afraid of anyone. Why are we whispering? Because I'm afraid of Mom. You just gotta be a bigger person and rise above it. It's that easy. Auggie, I do believe this is the best year for you to start school because everybody is going to be new. - But if you really don't wanna go... - No. It's okay. I wanna go. You do? What changed your mind? Well they have a really good science elective. And I need a better science teacher. Well, there's that. Are you gonna take that, Mom? Can I get some backup here? You gonna let him talk to your wife like this? I'm not gonna let him talk to my wife like that. - Please! - Get him. Come on, Via. Get in there. Get in there. Get in there. I'll meet you right here after school. Okay? Right here. - I love you. - Love you too. I'll see you later. Can you hear me? We're gonna have a little man-to-man. Now, I gotta stop here, because past this point is a "No Dad Zone" and you don't wanna walk up with your parents because it's not cool. But you're cool. I know I am, but technically most dads aren't, so... And neither are these helmets. Hey. Two rules. First, only raise your hand once a class, no matter how many answers you know. Except for science. Crush them all. Check. Second... you're gonna feel like you're all alone, Auggie, but you're not. Check. Should we lose this? Come on, costumes are for Halloween. Prepare for blastoff. I love you. I love you, too. - Have fun. - Bye. Have an excellent mission and Godspeed. We are ready to proceed at this time. 10, 9, 8, 7... Dear God, please, make them be nice to him. 4, 3, 2, 1. My mom always said... "If you don't like where you are... just picture where you wanna be." Auggie! Auggie! Auggie! Auggie! I can't wait till Halloween. All right, let's settle down. Everybody settle down. Saved. Sorry. Everybody find your seats? Yes? Finding our seats. Great. All right, now some of us are lucky enough to know each other. Yeah? And... and others are new. Hi there. Okay. My name is Mr. Browne. And you're late. Yeah. I'm so sorry. I was just helping set up chairs for the assembly. Don't worry about it. Can anybody tell me what this word means? Anybody? No? Precepts are rules for really important things. Like mottos. Like mottos or like famous quotes. Or like, lines from a fortune cookie. Right? Precepts can help motivate us. They can guide us when we have to make decisions about really important things. "Okay, so why are you talking to me about precepts this early in the morning, Mr. Browne?" Well, let me tell you. Because precepts, also, can tell us a lot about ourselves. "Who is it that I aspire to be?" That is the question that we should be asking ourselves all the time. "What kind of person am I?" So this is what we're gonna do. Everyone's gonna come up with two things... that they think everybody else should know about them. All right? I'll go first. Number one, I used to work on Wall Street. For a long time. And two, I left Wall Street to pursue my dream and teach. Who's next? Yes. Julian Albans. And I think it's cool how you're pursuing your dream. Thank you very much, Julian. Let's hear your two things. Okay. One, I just got Battleground Mystic on my Wii and it's totally awesome. And number two, we got a ping pong table this summer. Amazing. Any questions for Julian? Yes? Is Battleground Mystic multiplayer or single player? Let's... Not those kinda questions. Okay... Hi. My name's August Pullman. "Auggie." And... I have a sister named Via and a dog named Daisy. I love Star Wars. And I just said three things. Yeah. Sorry. Well, that sounds like a bonus to me. Three things. Thank you very much, Auggie, that was perfect. Who's next? I actually have a question for Auggie. What's the deal with the braid in the back of your hair? Is it like a Padawan thing? What's a Padawan thing? It's from Star Wars. Padawan is a Jedi apprentice. Who's your favorite character, Auggie? Boba Fett. What about Darth Sidious? Do you like him? Ouch. Okay, can we talk about Star Wars at recess? Yes? All right. Who wants to read this month's precept? Me! Me! Me! What about you? What's your name? - Summer. - Summer. Wanna give it a shot? "When given the choice between being right or being kind... choose kind." Hey, can I sit there? Sure. You eat like the Sarlacc monster, my young Padawan. Newton's first law of motion. An object in motion will stay in motion unless... It's okay, I didn't expect you to know that on the first day. Acted on by another force. Acted on by another force. Very good. Here's how it works. A moving object will only change its speed or direction... if something else causes it to do that. Hey, Darth Hideous, did you hear? Padawan braids were lame 15 years ago. Supposedly. With a "D." - Dude! - More like they were always lame. See you tomorrow. Later, Barf Hideous. - Hey. - Hey, Mom. Auggie, you're supposed to knock. I'm serious this time. Wait, did someone make fun of it? I, for one, had a great day. Just trying to lighten the mood. Right, Daisy? Right. Good girl. Well I went to, Kinko's today to see if they could get my thesis off this. You're gonna finish your dissertation? - What is that? - It's a floppy disk. A what? Come on! You... It... A floppy... These kids today. It's basically an iPhone. You know, it doesn't play music or, you can't call, but... They couldn't get the file. That's okay. You'll find a place. Well, I think it's great, Mom. Maybe. Thank you. So Auggie... Yeah? Hi. How was your first day of school? Earth to Auggie. We asked you a question. - Come on, how was your day? - Good. Good how? "Good," like it was good? Or "good," like it was bad and you just don't wanna tell us? It was good, okay? I just don't know what you want me to say! It was good! Okay, hey! If you're mad at Mom about going to school, it was my idea, too. Why can't I just say "good" like anybody else? Batting a thousand today. Are they gonna ask about my day? That is not the way we leave the table. Hey, come on. Talk to me. Sit down. Take that off, please. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. It'll be okay. Why do I have to be so ugly? You are not ugly, Auggie. You just have to say that because you're my mom. Because I'm your mom, it doesn't count? Yeah. Because I'm your mom, it counts the most because I know you the most. You are not ugly and anyone who cares to know you will see that. They won't even talk to me. It matters that I look different. I try to pretend that it doesn't, but it does. I know. Is it always gonna matter? I don't know. Honey. Listen... Look at me. We all... have marks on our face. I have this wrinkle here from your first surgery... and have these wrinkles here from your last surgery. This is the map... that shows us where we're going. And this is the map... that shows us where we've been. And it's never... ever ugly. But what about your gray hair? That's compliments of your dad, I think. And as though we summoned him. How was your day? My day is really good right now. So they went to Florida, where Gollum was living in Miami. And... You know what it is? Daddy doesn't have his glasses on. You're making this up. August is the sun. My mom and dad and me are planets orbiting the sun. But I love my brother and I'm used to the way this universe works. My mom says that on my fourth birthday... I wished for a little brother. And when he was born, it only took me a few seconds and I was all over him. Can you hear me? If they stare, let them stare. You can't blend in when you were born to stand out. I've never asked my mom for help with my homework. I never needed my dad to remind me to study for a test. I just did most of my studying in waiting rooms and hospitals. Mom and Dad would always say I was the most understanding girl in the world. I don't know about that. I just knew my family couldn't take one more thing. I know my family loves me, but ever since my grandma died, my best friend Miranda is the only person who knows me. Miranda! Look at you. Hey, Via. I've texted you, like, 1,000 times. When'd you get back from camp? Two weeks ago. Two weeks? Sorry, it's been crazy. You know? Yeah, no, that's okay. What'd you do to your hair? Do you like it? Yeah. Yeah. It looks wild. Just trying something different, you know? I'll catch you later. - Hey, Ella. - Hey. Thinking about signing up? - For what? - The Drama Club. They study theater in the fall and do a play in the spring. No, not really. I'm... I'm not a theater nerd. Well, that's too bad. I am. I'm Justin, by the way. Sorry, that was... That was rude. I'm Via. Olivia. First days suck, don't they? Yeah. Yeah, they do. My mom tried to walk me here from the subway. I literally had to ditch her at the traffic light. My mom still doesn't think I can use a MetroCard. Are you an only child too? Yeah. Yeah. They never listen. This one time I told my mom I wanted to take guitar lessons and play like Jimi Hendrix. What happened? Well it was nice to meet you, Via. Olivia. Yeah. It was nice to meet you too, Justin. Maybe, I'll see you around. Though not onstage, clearly. Come in. Good night, honey. Wh... Where's Mom? She fell asleep. Okay. How's Auggie? There's some bully, you know, that... How was your first day? It was... It was really good. It was good? Yeah. Say hi to Miranda for us. I will. Sweet dreams. Good night. My mom put her life on hold for my brother. She always wanted to be a children's book illustrator and teach art. She was one thesis shy of getting her master's when Auggie was born. Then... she stopped writing it. She stopped a lot of things when Auggie was born. But she is still great at drawing. I don't know if she even realizes that she makes Auggie the center of every universe she draws. Miranda used to joke that my house was like the Earth. It revolved around the son... not the daughter. That doesn't change the fact that my mother has a great eye. I just wish that one time... she would use it to look at me. Yeah, good job, good job. Miranda? Via? What are you doing here? Just trying something new. You? Same. All right, everybody, let's go. Time for vocal warm up. Bring it in! Bring it in, people, let's go! Everybody, hands up! Reach high! And... Guys, can you please... Okay. You, you... You guys, scooch. Sit. Just be closer. Ladies and gentlemen. Stay. Stay, good. Hey, hey. What's your name? Auggie. Nice boots. Great. Thanks. Okay, everybody, here we go. We're scooching and say "Cheese." Cheese! School became... Well, I got used to it. Except for dodgeball. What evil man invented dodgeball? But my least favorite zone at school is courtyard. Because the whole school's there. No one does anything mean. Or says anything. Or laughs. They all just look, then look away, then look back. They're just being normal kids. I kinda wanna tell them, "Hey, I know I look weird, but it's okay." I mean, if Chewbacca started going to school here one day, I'd probably stare at him a bit, too. I'm sorry if my staring made you feel weird. In order for any of us to see, we need light. So right now light is bouncing off this card traveling through the air, through the glass, to your eye. But what if we added water? Indeed. Any time light passes from one material or medium to another, it bends. This bending of light is also known as... Refraction. Very good, Auggie. Jack, you okay? Yeah, yeah, refraction. Good. Clear your desks. Pop quiz. Hurry. Hey, Jack, come sit here. In a sec. Where's he going? Hey. Thanks for your help today. No problem. And don't worry, I got a couple wrong so Ms. Petosa wouldn't know. I'm not worried. The worst they can do is kick me out. Not loving school either? It's great. I wanted to go to Wayne Middle. The one with the great sports teams. Then why'd you come here? They gave me the scholarship. Well, if you need help in science, you can come to my house after school. You know, if you want. Great. Thanks! What's wrong? I just don't like eating in front of people. What do you mean? It's a long story, but when I eat, I think I chew like some prehistoric swamp turtle. No joke? Me too! Now there's tuna on your face. Yeah! Tuna-Man! No, no, no, let me show you how it's done. Dude, that's even more gross. I'm going as Boba Fett this year. I like Halloween, but Christmas is still the best holiday. No way. Halloween is the best. A pillowcase of candy versus two weeks off school? You're nuts. You see? Even your dog agrees. Hey, Mom, is it okay if Jack comes over? - Yes! - Thanks, Mrs. P. I mean, you get snow on Christmas. But you can get snow on Halloween. - How? - If you live in Alaska or there's a blizzard. I've got to be cool. You ever thought about having plastic surgery? No, I've never thought about it. Why? Dude, this is after plastic surgery. It takes a lotta work to look this good. Oh, my God! One, two, three, four, I declare a thumb war. Bow, kiss, begin. Nate. Fire. Okay, everybody, if you can't see the camera, the camera can't see you. Now let's improv like we know what we're doing. Okay, everybody say, "Stella!" Stella! So I can't figure you out. What? I can't figure you out. Well, most theater people won't stop talking about themselves, but you don't talk. I... I listen. - Me too. - I know. So you do pay attention. Okay, that's a start. I'm a good listener, so tell me something. Who are you gonna audition for? I'm not really the Our Town-type. Come on. Don't be the "run lights girl." Should be Emily. The lead? Look, your family can't cheer for you in a booth. They're... they're pretty busy. I don't think they would cheer for me anyway. Come on, there... there's not one person in your family who would applaud you? My grandmother. There you go. Bring her. I can't. Well, then I'll applaud you. Why are you being so nice to me? Because you're an only child. We have to stick together. Think about it. Okay? And, your grandmother's still cheering you on. I know you. And I love you more than anything in the world. Well... what about Auggie? I love your brother. But he has a lot of angels looking out for him. And you have me. Yeah. You are everywhere. And... you are my favorite. You're my favorite too, Grams. Mom, Daisy ruined my Boba Fett costume! What? Where have you been? It's very late. - She threw up all over it. - I'm sorry. Okay, well, you'll just have to wear your costume from last year. But I told Jack I was going as Boba Fett, not Ghost Face. Well, tomorrow is Halloween. And all the shops are closed. And my artistic hands are busy making meatloaf. So you do the math. Fine! - Do you need some help, Mom? - What? Some help. Yes, thank you. Mince that rosemary, please. Where did you say you were? I... I went to Coney Island. How about you stay home from school tomorrow? It's Halloween. We can make it a three-day weekend. Spend some time together. Yeah. Yeah, that would be really nice. Yeah? Okay, good. Peppers? I don't want peppers. Peppers give Daddy gas. I don't care what Jack Will says about Christmas. Hey, Auggie! For me, Halloween is the best holiday in the world. It's so awesome, when I'm wearing the costume. I usually walk with my head down to avoid being seen. But on Halloween, I walk with my head up high. I don't even know who that was. He didn't even know who I was. It's so cool. Especially because people don't like to touch me because they think I'm contagious. Oh, yeah, Chewie! Up high! Boom goes the dynamite! It really does look like him. - This part right? - Yeah. I mean, he's always reminded me of, like, the shrunken head, you know? - Or an orc. - Yeah. If I looked like him I swear, I'd put a hood over my face every day. Yeah, if I looked like him, I think I'd kill myself. Why do you hang out with him so much, Jack? - Yeah. - I dunno. Tushman asked me to be his welcome buddy and now he just follows me around everywhere. Well, that must stink! That must stink. Oh, yeah. Just like him. Nobody puts Baby in the corner. Come on. Always blows my mind how much Daddy looks like Patrick Swayze in this movie. No! Hey, tell me what's going on with Miranda? It's not... It's not just the pink hair. She's just... She won't even talk to me. I had a friend in high school. We went through this exact same thing. And what I did, which fixed it almost immediately... Yeah? Was, to eat an entire jack-o'- lantern bucket of candy. Hello? Yes, Mr. Tushman. He's nauseous? Does he have a fever? What did the nurse say? I'm so sorry, honey. All right. Okay. Thank you. I will be right there. Honey, I have to go, your brother just threw up at school. Nate, do you know where his helmet is? He's asking for it and I've looked everywhere. I don't know. Something at school. He won't say. He won't come out of his room. And now he says he doesn't even wanna go trick-or-treating. I know. Okay. Thank you. Just get here. Come on, get ready. It's almost time for the Halloween parade. You're supposed to knock! Go away! Mom says you won't say what happened. Did someone say something? Someone always says something! Well, tell me what happened. It's none of your business! You took my day with Mom, so it is my business. I heard Jack Will talking about me behind my back. He said he'd kill himself if he looked like me. Jack Will? Isn't he the nice one? There are no nice ones! I wish I'd never gone to school in the first place! But you were liking school. I know you were. I hate it, okay? I hate it. Auggie, I'm sorry, but you're not the only one who has bad days. Bad days? Do people avoid touching you? When a person accidentally touches you, do they call it "the plague"? - No. - Jack Will was all I had. So just don't compare your bad days at school to mine, okay? Okay. Hey. Did you notice that Miranda doesn't come around anymore? What? You didn't. Shocker. Yeah. She went away to camp this summer and now she doesn't like me anymore. Why? Because... school sucks. And people change. So if you wanna be a normal kid, Auggie, then those are the rules. So let's go trick-or-treating. Okay? Because right now... we're each other's best friends. Really? Yes. So... come on. I'll let you have all my Halloween candy. I'll trade you my apples. Okay, no. I... I know that I said that you could have all my candy, but I was really just saying that to get you out of the house. What about the chocolate? - No. - And the Smarties? Gummies, the licorice, the Reese's, the Hersheys... - No! - And everything else. All right, I'll let you have all my candy. Okay, Via. You are next please. Let's hear it for Via. Daisy... do you wanna help me take back my corner office? Hey, Auggie! You feeling better? Are you okay, Auggie? Yeah. You sure? 'Cause you're acting really weird. I'm okay, Jack, okay? Okay. They want me to do what? Give a tour through the school. But Mom, it's summer vacation. I know. But your teachers told Mr. Tushman you're known as a good egg. - No, I'm a bad egg. - You're a good egg. And I'm actually really proud they thought of you for this. Mom, enough with the guilt. And you know they gave you a scholarship, right? Mom... Who else is doing it? Charlotte and Julian. - No. - Why, what's wrong? Charlotte will just talk about Broadway the whole time. And Julian is the biggest phony on the planet. So I'm sorry, but no. Jack, it's for that boy. Who? The one from the ice cream shop. Yeah. So if a nice kid like your little brother cries when he sees him, what kind of a chance do you think he has in middle school? Okay. Thank you, kiddo. Four things I've learned about Auggie Pullman: First of all, you do get used to his face. Now, this is not like regular ice. You can't touch it with your hands, okay? Second, he's really smart. He's ahead of me in everything. In science, he's ahead of the whole school. Is everybody watching? Third of all, he's actually pretty funny. But fourthly, now that I know him, I would say I actually do wanna be friends with Auggie. At first, I admit it, I was only friendly to him because my mom asked me to be nice. But now I would choose to hang out with him. Like, he's a good friend. Like, if all the guys in fifth grade were lined up against a wall and I could choose anyone I wanted to hang out with... I would choose Auggie. Hey, what's wrong? Go away. Hey, Jack, come sit with us. Yeah, come on, man. I wonder what happened. Maybe Jack touched Auggie and couldn't wash his hands in time. Jack finally got "the plague." That's not very nice. What? We didn't start it. Where you going? Hi. I'm Summer. I know. We're in the same homeroom. You don't have to do this. Do what? You don't have to be my friend. I know Tushman talked to you. I don't know what you're talking about, Auggie. I know Tushman talked to some kids before school started and told them they had to be friends with me. He didn't talk to me. Yeah, he did. - No, he did not. - Yeah, he did. No, he didn't, I swear on my life! Okay, okay. You don't have to get mad. I don't like being accused of things, okay? Okay. I'm sorry. You should be. - He really didn't talk to you? - Auggie! Okay, I just... Why are you sitting here then? Because I want some nice friends for a change. Me, too. Cool beans. But you'll get "the plague." Good. Summer has "the plague." Shut up! So what happened with Jack Will? Promise you won't tell? I got it! I got the part! - Congratulations. - Thank you. She got it! She got the part! Oh, my God! - Bet she got Emily. - Yep. What'd you get? Emily's understudy. I'm not saying poison or anything, but just a little Benadryl to knock Miranda out before the show. Okay, enough. Look, just learn her lines and it'll give us an excuse to hang out more. We can start rehearsing the kissing scene on page 110. Wait. George and Emily? There is no page 110. So I'm thinking... I really wanna kiss you right now. But I don't know how you'll respond. What's wrong? I'm not an only child. Mom? One sec, Via. Auggie, let's go! I thought you were at the library. Yeah, change of plans. Hi, I'm Justin. Isabel. Daisy threw up again. Bucket loads. Bucket loads. Justin, this is my little brother Auggie. - Hey, dude! - Hey. What's that in your case? A machine gun? No. It's a fiddle. You should tell people it's a machine gun. That's way cooler. You know what? That's a great idea, you're right. We're on our way to the grocery. Mom's making... What's it called? - Feijoada. - Feij... Mom's making feijoada. It's Dad's favorite. You're welcome to stay if you want, Justin. Thank you very much. It was nice meeting you. Nice to meet you too. Bye, Auggie. Nothing to see here. It's a gene. Well, it's sort of two genes, but two genes that are identical. And the trouble is that both of my parents carry the gene at the same time, which is... Well essentially... he won the lottery. Backwards or something. And... in another world, I'd look like him. I'm sorry for telling you that I was an only child. Sometimes it's nice to hide a little. I get it. It's okay. - Hello? - Major Tom, is that you? Miranda! It's so great to hear your voice again. Sorry, Via's not here. I was actually calling to say hello to you. How have you been? Good. Did you know I'm going to a regular school now? No way. Do you like it? Yeah, I guess. It's not as hard as Mom's homeschool. Yeah, I'll bet. How are the kids? Are they nice? No. But I made one friend. Her name's Summer. We started a summer names club. Summer, August. Get it? Good for you, Auggie. Where's Via, anyway? She's out with her boyfriend. Really? Yeah. We met him last week. He's super nice. I've missed you, Major Tom. I miss you too, Miranda. And can you tell Via that I've missed her too? Well, but why don't you just tell her yourself? Listen, I gotta go, my mom's calling me, but, you know that you can call me anytime, right? Yeah. Okay, so call me anytime. I will. Merry Christmas, Auggie. Merry Christmas, Miranda. - Get after it. - Just open it. Rip it apart. Via and I have been best friends since kindergarten. Oh, my God! Her family's always been like my second family. Auggie's always felt like my little brother. How does it feel? - Awesome. - Good. And for a few years, even, our family's spent Christmas together. Everybody say "Merry Christmas!" Merry Christmas! But now my dad's busy with his new wife... who was his old boss. And my mom, well, she's busy not getting over that. I got a job at a summer camp... just so I'd have somewhere to go that wasn't home. One day, and I swear I didn't plan this but... I started playing this little make believe game... with the girls in the camp. I said I lived in a huge brownstone. On a nice street... with my two awesome parents and my awesome dog, named Daisy. And my awesome little brother... with a facial deformity. And, oh, my God, everyone went crazy. "What do you mean, 'deformity'? What does he look like?" Suddenly, everyone wanted to talk to me. And by the end of summer... I was the most popular girl in camp. When I got home, I wanted to call Via. But she would've asked me about my parents and about camp. And then I saw Via audition for the play and I remembered how cool she is. And how I understood why everyone in camp loved me more when I pretended to be her. She used to let Auggie hang out with us all the time. I was the one who bought him his astronaut helmet. He was so into outer space. And I wanted him to know that the world was bigger than his room. And now he's out there... and I didn't even know. I could've helped him. Maybe he could've helped me. I don't know. But I could sure use some help right now. That was awesome! Hey, look, there's Jack Will. Let's find another hill. You can't just keep avoiding him forever, Auggie. Come on, let's go! Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Thanks for the help, Daisy. Way to put your back into it. What about you? Christmas was awesome. We drove up into the mountains where they had the most amazing snow I've ever seen. - It was like powder. - Nice. What about you, Jack? I went up Skeleton Hill. It was the best. - Skeleton Hill? - I hate that place. It should be called Garbage Hill. I know, right? I left my old lightning sled there last time I was up. It was the crappiest piece of junk. Went back the next day and someone had taken it. Hey, maybe a homeless guy wanted to go sledding. - Yeah. - Yeah. New precept. Your deeds are your monuments. Archaeologists found these words inscribed on the walls of an ancient Egyptian tomb. Can anybody tell me what they mean? Summer? I think it means that the things we do are the things that matter most. Excellent. Anybody else? Hey, Summer. Hey. You okay? Yeah. Fine. Just... This is gonna sound stupid, but... do you know why Auggie stopped liking me? You should ask him. I have, but ever since Halloween, he just won't talk to me. I mean, you know what? I don't care. Sorry. Ghost Face. Wait, wait, what? That's all I can tell you. Okay... Now that we've finished our tests, I want you all to start thinking about our fifth grade science fair project. Which you will need to work on to have ready after spring break. Okay? Now it could be about anything. Just make sure... The point is... to create something you're excited about. Something you're proud to show. Mr. Will? Mr. Will? Something more important to think about? No. So, it'll be teams of two. Your partner will be your tablemate. Ms. Petosa? I know we're supposed to be in pairs, but... Jack, Amos, and I had this science fair project idea that we wanted to work on together. - Okay, maybe we can switch... - No. - Sorry? - What? No, it's... it's okay. I'll stay with who I've got. I'll stick with Auggie. Hey! What did you do that for? Dude, I don't want to switch. Why not? Do you really wanna be partners with that freak? Dear Mr. Tushman, I am very sorry for punching Julian. It was wrong of me to do that. I know you may need to expel me, but I'd still rather not say... why I did what I did. It might get Julian in trouble too - and that's not fair. - Stop! Sincerely, Jack Will. Dear Mr. Will... one thing I've learned in 20 years in education is that there are two sides to every story. So I think I can imagine what started the fight. While nothing justifies striking another student... I know good friends are worth defending. So, after your two-day suspension... your scholarship will be waiting for you. I thought we were friends. Just keep up the good work. And keep being the fine boy we all know you to be. Sincerely, Mr. Tushman. What's so wrong with me not telling you about a stupid play? I'm not even in it, I'm just doing the lights. Well, your boyfriend is in it and don't you think we would like to see him? - No, I don't. - Look, let's all calm down for a second. You know, you've been really good at leaving me alone my whole life. So why are you suddenly so interested? Are you... Are you bored now that Auggie's in school? Your thesis not going well? Nate, could you please excuse us? - Izzy, she doesn't mean... - Nate! What are they saying down there? They, my friend, are saying a lotta things. None of which concern us. Let's see your new Minecraft world, 'cause we might be moving to it. So, are we going to see the play? I hadn't realized what the play was and I don't think it will be of any interest to a kid your age. Yeah, you'd... you'd get totally bored. Are you and Dad going? Daddy will go and I'm gonna stay here with you. What? So now you're gonna punish me by not going? Well, you didn't want me to go in the first place, remember? Well, now that you know about it, of course I want you to come. What are you talking about? - Nothing. - Nothing. You're lying. It's just something to do with Via's school, honey. You just don't want your fancy high school friends to know your brother's a freak? - Auggie! - Auggie, that's not true. Stop lying to me. I'm not an idiot, I know what's going on! Daisy girl? Auggie. Come on. It's okay, I don't wanna go to your stupid high school anyway. I don't care. Auggie, not everything in the world is about you. What's wrong? You're gonna be fine, girlie. Daddy's gonna meet me there. Take care of your brother. - Yeah. - Okay. All right. Did Daisy really bite Mom? Well... she was whimpering. And then Mom tried to pick her up and Daisy bit her. Do you think the vet can fix her? She was in a lot of pain, Auggie. She's really old. Auggie? I want you to come to my play. Okay? Really? Really. Every time I came home from the hospital, Daisy was here. She was a real friend. And real friends... are hard to find. - Excuse me. - Sorry. Thank you. This is perfect. Here we go. Good seats. See if you can find Via's name in there, honey. Glasses. Oh, no! I think I forgot my glasses. Auggie, you're missing a great episode of Hoarders, right here. Starring your mom's purse. You ready? Are you supposed to be in the girls' dressing room? Just wanted to wish you good luck. "Break a leg," not "good luck." You too. Anyone cheering you on tonight? Yeah... my mom invited the entire block. It's gonna be really embarrassing. You? My dad is on his belated honeymoon and my mom's in a funk, but maybe she'll come tomorrow. Well, Via's family will cheer you on. You'll be great tonight. - Honey, just enjoy the play. - Okay. All right, go get them. Mr. Davenport? I'm really sorry, but I can't go on tonight. I don't feel well. I think I might throw up. Okay, everybody gets nervous. You know, when I did my Hamlet, I threw up every night. You're gonna be fine. Just do it. You'll have of spring break to recover. Mr. Davenport, you're not listening. I'm not going on. Are you kidding me? I'm really sorry, but Via knows all the lines. She can do it. Then go find her then. Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. This play is called Our Town. It was written by Thornton Wilder. The name of our town is Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. Just across the Massachusetts line. Is this... Is this really happening? Yes, you're going on as Emily. We don't have much time. Well, I don't even know if I'm gonna remember all of my lines. You'll be great. Justin will help you through it. Where is she? Via, you're on in two minutes. Why... why are you doing this? - I told you... I feel sick. - Okay. We've got a factory in our town too. You hear it? - Hey, it's okay. - Makes blankets. Hey, break a leg. Cartwrights own it and it brung them a fortune. Children, now I won't have it. Breakfast is just as good as any other meal and I won't have you gobbling like wolves. It'll stunt your growth. That's a fact. Miranda looks so different. That's not Miranda, that's Via. - What? - It's Via. Great. As for me, I'd rather have my children healthy than bright. I'm both, Mama, you know I am. I'm the brightest girl in school for my age. I have a wonderful memory. Eat your breakfast. Your stomach flu got better fast. Sorry, sir, just jitters. I'll be ready by tomorrow night. She's doing very well. I can't... I can't go on. It... It goes so fast. We don't even have time to look at one another. I didn't realize. So all that was going on and we never noticed? Take me back... up the hill... to my grave. But first... wait... one more look. Goodbye... goodbye, world. Goodbye, Grover's Corners. Mama... and Papa. Goodbye to clocks ticking. And food. And coffee. And hot baths. And sleeping. And waking up. Earth... You're too wonderful for anybody to realize you. Blow out the candles. Ready? Take a big breath. We did it. Did you make a wish? I wished for a brother. You did? Happy Birthday, honey. Via! Oh, my God! That was incredible! - It was just a play. - It wasn't "just" anything. - You were amazing! - You were great, Via! Amazing! Thanks, Auggie. - And then there was the nurse... - Yeah. ...who farted, and I don't use that word a lot, about 100 times. Honey, that was you. To put it delicately. I don't know how else to say it. It's... It's not true. - Busted now! - No, it's not... Anyone? Raise your hand if you wanna change the subject and save us from this story. All right, I will. I will. What is that? That is, Jack and Auggie's science fair project. Not to be confused with an eyesore in the middle of the room. No, but what is it? Well, I don't know. I guess it's like a... yeah. Follow me, you'll see. - Okay. - Come on! All right. - Sweet. - What? Are you kidding me? I cannot believe you just did that. - Go, go, go. - Okay. But just no kissing. Seen a lotta horror movies end this way. We're gonna open the apertures in 3, 2, 1. It's a camera obscura. Yeah. He's ten. Oh, my God, that was so cool. Cinema history come to life. All right, people, single file. Step right up for an amazing camera obscura. Step right up to witness Earth's greatest mystery, the volcano. Okay, we're gonna open the apertures in... - Three, two, one! - Three, two, one! - Whoa! - That's awesome! Jack and Auggie. - Dude! - Dude! - See, you have to go... - No, I did. Okay, now I'll go. I know, right? Let's go, let's go. Everybody get in here. Find your seats. We good today? It's gonna be a good one, guys. All right. Everybody inside. Come on. New month, new precept. Look at him. Hey, where's Auggie? Right there. Hey, hey, hey. Why are we running in the hallway? Auggie, you okay? Yeah. Everything's fine. I'm late for class. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Auggie, you know if you need help, you can ask for it. You're not alone. I know. Amos. You know something about this? You understand? We take bullying very seriously at this school. There's zero tolerance. Excuse me, can you explain what's going on here? Wasn't Julian the one who got punched in the mouth? If there's any bullying going on, it isn't my son. You wrote that, Julian? Yes, sir. That one note was on the back of a class photo. Your son photoshopped Auggie out of it. No. No, he didn't. I did. Of course, I didn't think that he would bring it to school. But when our friends come over and they see that picture, I want them to ask about our son, not the Pullmans'. Mrs. Albans. When we pressed Auggie, he showed us these other notes... that your son left in his locker and in his desk and... chair. Okay, look, if no one else is gonna have the courage to say it, then I guess I will. These kids are too young to be dealing with this sort of thing. Julian has had nightmares because of that kid. - Sarah. - Did you know that? We had to take him to a child psychologist to help him deal with his night terrors. It's just a two-day suspension. You'll stay home from the nature preserve trip. That's all. Two days for a couple of notes from a kid? After all the money that we have poured into this school? We have a lot of friends on the school board, Mr. Tushman. Well, I have more. So what would you have us do? Bend over backwards for every single person in the world? Nobody can get their feelings hurt ever? You are not doing these kids any favors. Mrs. Albans, Auggie can't change the way he looks. So, maybe we can change the way we see. Yes. I will be sure to tell that to the real world. Thank you for this. We won't be back in the fall. Mom. I like this school. Mom, Mom. I have friends, Dad. Let's go, Julian. Come on. Mr. Tushman. I'm really sorry. I know you are, Julian. He's not even looking at us. This is gonna be epic. Race ya! The sound of joy! All right. I want you to close your eyes, because I have a surprise for you. Do you take requests? Not before 9:45. Okay. Open your eyes. - No! You... you finished your thesis! - Let's get drunk. Yes! Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Wait a minute. The double surprise, surprise. - Okay. - Go ahead. - Nothing's gonna jump out at me, is it? - No. Giving me the eyes. What's in here? I'm kind of scared... Good, right? I'm just gonna keep that in the box for now. Does that merit a kiss? Come here. More than a kiss. Thank you. All right, kids! Let's give a big warm welcome to the William Heath School, The Glover Academy and Beecher Prep! Last chance to get popcorn! - Hello. - Okay! Well, welcome to the 23rd annual Big Movie Saturday in the Broarwood Nature Reserve! Tonight's movie will be... The Wizard of Oz! Hey, dude. You wanna go outside? Why? We can watch this movie any time. Dude! Oh, man, I need to pee. Wanna go back? Nah, I'll just go over here. Like in the subways? That's gross. No. This is gross. Look at that. What? What are you looking at? I'm going up there someday. Well, I'm going down here right now, so... I gotta go too now. You go there. I'll go here. Don't look. What do we got here? Couple of losers stinking up the woods. Holy crap! Look at his face! He's a freak! Jesus, I've never seen anything that ugly in my life. Maybe it's an orc. - Dude, let's go. - Go where? Hey, talking to you, Gollum. Is this the one mask to rule them all? My precious. Hey, what's your problem? Your boyfriend's my problem. Hey! Leave him alone. What are you gonna do about it? - Get outta my way. - No. I said get outta my way! I said no! Jack, what's up, man? What's this? More little freaks? What you call us, hick? Come on, prep boy. Guys, stop! Guys, stop it! Guys, stop! Just stop, please! Stop! Just go! Oh, man! Dude! Come on! Let's go! Let's get out! Are you okay? Dude, you're bleeding. What was that? Something's coming. - Amos? - Jack! - Over here! - Amos, come on! They following you? I think we lost them. How did you guys know we needed help? We saw them follow you out of the lodge. I think they were seventh graders. They were huge. Thanks, guys. You totally saved our butts. Yeah, thanks, guys. You know, it was cool how you stood your ground, little dude. Hi! Oh, my gosh, I missed you so much! See you later, Auggie! - Bye! - How are you? Good. And guess what? I got in a fight. Oh my God, you're bleeding! Are you okay? What happened? - Auggie got in a fight. - What? That's terrible. I'm sorry. - Did you win? - Nate! Well, I'm getting a vibe like maybe he won. Did you? Yeah. And guess what? They were seventh graders. Yes! See you later, buddy! Bye! Fighting is bad, Auggie. - Bye, Mr. and Mrs. P. - Goodbye. See you at graduation, Auggie. Looking sharp. - Thanks, Dad. - I'm talking about me. Hey! You look good too. I think it's safe to say the Pullman men are crushing it today. - You've come a long way. - Yeah. Auggie, I am proud of you for sticking it out. You didn't think I would, did you? Of course I did. Okay, well, come on, you gotta... I mean, when you started you were still wearing the astronaut helmet in public. I love that helmet. I wish I knew where it was. It's in my office. What? Dad! That was a gift. You had no right to hide it! Auggie, Auggie, please, don't be mad. You gotta understand, you were wearing it all the time. I never got to see you anymore. I missed your face. I know you don't always like it, but I love it. It's my son's face. I wanna see it. Can you forgive me? No. Yes. Does Mom know? No. God, no, she'd kill me. But I can maybe find it, if you need it back. That's okay. - Mom. - Yes? Thank you. - For what? - Making me go to school. I was so mad at you sometimes. But I'm really happy to be here. You really are a wonder, Auggie. You are a wonder. Follow the day Follow the day and reach for the sun! Thank you, choir. That was beautiful. Ladies, gentlemen, boys and girls, graduates. Final award this morning is the Henry Ward Beecher medal to honor students who have been notable or exemplary. Usually, it's a "good works..." a service award. But I came upon a passage that he wrote, which made me realize that good works... come in many forms. "Greatness," he wrote, "lies not in being strong, but in the right using of strength. He or she is the greatest... whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his own." Without further ado... this year, I am very proud to award the Henry Ward Beecher medal to the student whose quiet strength has carried up the most hearts. So, will August Pullman please come up here to receive this award? You're the best, dude! Walking up towards that stage, I felt like I was floating. My heart was beating so fast. I didn't really understand why I was getting a medal. It's not like I blew up the Death Star. All I did was get through fifth grade, just like everyone else here. Congratulations. Here you go. That's for you. Then again, maybe that's kind of the point. Maybe the truth is, I'm really not so ordinary. Maybe if we knew what other people were thinking we'd know that no one's ordinary. And we all deserve a standing ovation at least once in our lives. My friends do. My teachers do. My sister does for always being there for me. My dad does for always making us laugh. And my mom does the most. For never giving up... on anything. Especially, me. It's like that last precept Mr. Browne gave us. Be kind, for everyone is fighting a hard battle. And if you really wanna see what people are, all you have to do... is look.
