It was a time the sky seemed so bright and blue... A time I believed it could carry a song straight into heaven... Number two and three optical electronic systems: check. Brainwave Control System interface: nominal. Brainwave readings: Beta wave is flat. Man-machine wave contacted. Synchronization complete. Chief Bowman... Please initiate link to the Brain Direct Imaging System. Roger. BDI System: nominal. YF-21 Omega One, standby to launch. Dopamine output from block 35-B in the right hemisphere is low. Do I increase emotion stimulation or change the code to UCL type? Switch to PSX sampling data and simulate. Bingo! Bingo! Give me a bit more stimulation on A-10. Let's add about three percent of Beta endorphin code. Miss Myung. Be careful at the news conference. Reporters have been sniffing about Sharon's A.I. system lately. Don't get careless I know! Keep it in mind. Your sync rate with the Brainwave Control Unit was 2.5% higher than last time. Next time, let's try setting the sync circuits to DA plus. Okay! DA plus it is! It looks like they've got a new test pilot for the YF-19. He's supposed to be a chronic req-breaker. I hear he's been bounced from one post to another. Looks like he's about to take off. Wanna watch? No matter who they send in, I won't give them this project. Tower to Eagle One. Millard here. The YF-19's airframe is unlike anything we've ever had before. Treat it with respect. Roger-dodger! Just 48 seconds to reach atmospheric service ceiling... Oh baby, you're too much! Eagle One, do you read me? Eagle One! What the hell are you doing?! Stick to the test schedule! It's like he's out of control. What's that animal doing?! Look at chase camera three! Is that...?! What's HE doing here? Damned showoff! Eagle One, coming in hot! What the hell were you doing?! My YF-19 isn't a toy-- Hey, baby. Did you see my Dino Bird? Wha? It was a present from the sky to you. You animal! Would you be serious and listen to me?! You loved it, didn't you? Your skywriting time is over. Then maybe it's time for a date? Yeah, with Col. Millard. Go on, he's waiting. You'd better be careful. He's the test pilot for the rival team-- Guld... He's a test pilot now? This man is a jinx. He brings misfortune to those around him. What...?! Don't. Hurry up and go see the colonel. What do you mean I'm overdoing things, sir? Never carry daring and recklessness in the same pocket. You know who said that? No, sir. I did. And I learned that lesson the hard way. Do you know what else you have in your pocket? No, sir. Stupidity! He's so transparent... Hey! Slow down! This dangerous! Stop it! I don't wanna commit double suicide with you!!! Thrilling, right?! You're truly weird. Who? Me? This place apparently used to be all forest land. And some people who climbed that mountain back then... ...saw a giant dino bird? You know about that? They used to call me the roughneck of Dalmatian High School! You jerk! Why didn't you say so before? That singing... No, it couldn't be... That's Sharon singing. She'll be here soon. It's gonna be great! She sounds like an old friend of mine. I doubt it's her. Sharon isn't human. Not human...? Oh, well! Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for coming today. I'm the general director of the Sharon Apple Galaxy Tour, Myung Fang Lone I'll take any questions you may have now. How do you feel about Sharon not just being considered acomputer generated virturoid idol anymore? That she's now the number one celebrity everyone wants as a girlfriend? Her owner, Mr. Reymond, said he wanted to adopt her. But some experts say that the singing of an emotionless computer is nothing more than a type of narcotic. That's not true at all She'd be deeply hurt if she heard that. Oh, did you hear? The 19 team's screwed up big time. The mad skywriter's apparently been grounded for three days. I feel like we've won already. Don't underestimate him. Hey, hey... Most of the military guys are betting on our team. It's in the bag! So we're looking forward to seeing everyone. at the Atlantis Dome in three days. And that wraps up the press conference for today. I believe you were born on this world, correct? Yes, sir...? Don't you really want to sing, instead of Sharon? No... I have no urge to sing anymore. Sharon may not be fully functional yet... ...but she's already captured the hearts of so many people. Once Sharon has awakened fully and can walk on her own... ...she won't need me anymore. I'm satisfied helping her to move people's hearts. Hmm... But why hasn't she awakened yet? The system is complete. Perhaps... Perhaps my feelings aren't enough to do it? You shouldn't torment yourself over it. Right... You're still a beautiful woman. Oh, look! Now THESE are rare nowadays. My late father always used to go deep into the mountains.... ...to pick flying-apple blossoms like these. Oh...? Uh, Myung, please! Sorry, sir. Looks like it's a fake. Guld... Why... Why are you here? I saw you on the news. I knew if you were on Eden you'd have to come here. And so you have... This place hasn't changed. There's nothing here. A boring place with nothing at all. How long have you been on Eden? I just got back yesterday It's been seven years... Do you know about Sharon Apple? I suppose you couldn't care less about a virturoid idol. I'm now the producer of the number one singer in the galaxy. I've done well for myself, haven't I? Do you still sing? I gave it up. A long time ago. And what about you, Guld? I'm testing a prototype fighter... ...out at New Edwards, in the desert. So... you fly. Yes... I wanted to make my dreams of... ...flying free in the sky come true. I see. So, you're doing well yourself. I know! Why don't you come to the concert? I'll just abuse my authority... ...as producer and let you in. We're still getting ready for the concert. It'll be the best concert people have ever seen. Sharon is the best-- Stop it. Just forget what happened back then. I'll help you forget... Aw, hell. There are other people here. Chief Bowman... It's been a long time, Isamu. Who's that? Have you forgotten me? Well, well... If it isn't Little Miss Myung, the school festival singing star. So you're Guld's lady now? Still playing the part of the noble knight, huh? Why you...! Show me what you've got! Stop it! You never should have come back to Eden. I won't let you have them... Not Myung, or the project! Stop it... Please, stop it. You should have just forgotten about me. I'm not the person you used to know. Nothing's the same anymore! I won't let you have them. Do whatever you want... ...but the project's mine. Let a traitor like you get it? Never. Mental feedback: nominal. Subliminal effect: penetrating subconscious. Shift mind controller to coquettish pulse mode. Brainwave OS pulse activity up to level 3. What are you up to? Nothing a non-fan would care about. Just watch... Come! Hey! What's happening?! Is it a coding bug? A virus?! You'll get arrested if they catch you! Don't worry. Sharon's the most advanced artificial intelligence system ever developed by the Macross Consortium. If I can't hack into her, I don't deserve the title of master hacker. Who says you are? Isamu... What's wrong? Your heart-rate's unstable. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...! Come to me, Sharon. This is the final poker chip to install in the RF module. A literal entelechy, wouldn't you say? I don't acknowledge Aristotle. Or his belief that the mind must be tied to the flesh. I could hardly believe it, Myung. Seeing you on TV introduced as Sharon Apple's manager. Her producer. Well, whatever. You haven't changed at all, Kate. Except now I'm a mother with two kids. You're married? Who do you think to? Isamu, Guld, or Morgan? Which one did I get? Morgan. Damn... That wasn't very fun. I ran into the other two. Just by accident. They haven't changed, either... They told me they're both test pilots out at New Edwards. Really... So, we all got what we wanted most. Hey! Long time no see. Morgan! Why didn't you ask my mom to take care of them? Well, I went to her house, but she's having a garage sale. I was afraid she'd end up selling the kids off, too. Oh well, then... Stop it! They copy everything I do. Zoom, zoom! Zoom, zoom! My boyfriend's a pilot! All right! Okay, now it's your turn, Myung. All right, this is it! The school festival idol! Come on, Myung. Sing that old song of yours! That one "Voices" or whatever. Great! Stop it! I mean... I quit singing. I had to move on. I got tired of it. And I can't remember any of my old songs, now. Sorry... Well, I guess I'll sing, then... Kate? Gotta crap. It's me! You're gonna let me in anyway, so I'm coming in, okay? Huh? Wha... What the... "What the hell are you doing?" I believe. Until my 19's back from being overhauled... I'm trying to kidnap Sharon. However, I can't find the most important part. Well, I suppose her virginity would be kinda hard to get. Please don't assume I'm like you. I was talking about her emotion program. Oh, please. This thing might have intelligence, but a heart?! A heart... Isamu? Are you in there? Not if that old shit Millard's looking for me! You've got a call from some woman. Well, that's different. Yeah, hello? Kate...? Oh yeah! Hey, how've you been? How'd you know I was here? Trying to revive some mad high school crush on me? You're the same old idiot, I see. Still punching holes in the walls? And you've still got a tongue like a knife. Listen, I've been having a drink with Myung. It's strange. She won't sing. Said she gave it up. She'd sooner give up food than her singing! This is a girl who used to sing in her sleep! Being Sharon Apple's producer just doesn't seem like her. Producer? You think there's a connection? With the time you three broke up? You were all such good friends... How should I know? I guess we just aren't kids anymore. Well, can't you come out here for a little while? Just to cheer her up? You've gotta be kidding. Guld said he would come. Well then, you definitely won't be needing me. Guld's gonna end up getting her. I SAID I'M NOT COMING, OKAY?! You selfish jerk! Myung! Come on! Where are we going? Come on! Ooh... I hate them. I hate your songs. And I hate my songs just as much. I don't want to see anyone else. I just want to go away and disappear. How does it feel? When you're flying through the sky... How does it feel? The sky, huh...? When the throttle's open for all it's worth... ...and the G's are slamming me back... ...and it seems like I'm flying straight on into forever... ...I feel like I can just barely see something. Another world. Another world? And what's it like? Can't be described! Still, I'd love to fly. All right! Shall we fly? Uh, this is Eagle One. Standing by for takeoff. Ready when you are. This is control. Stand by until I can get into a shower. I'm afraid Miss Myung Fang Lone isn't back, yet. I see... Room 405, please. Yes, sir. And put this in my safe deposit box. A fire will break out at the concert hall in 30 minutes. The concert hall...? What the hell...? Hello? A fire will break out at the concert hall in 30 minutes. A fire will break out at the concert hall in 30 minutes. What was that? Dunno. Probably a wrong number. Oh... Somebody... Somebody, help me! Somebody! Somebody... Myung! Are you in there?! Myung! Shit! Why isn't the alarm going off?! Guld... Do you hurt anywhere? No. I see. Guld, you're hurt! It's nothing serious. Yes it is! What were you doing there? I got a strange phone call. Phone call? It said a fire would break out at the concert hall. And besides that, I got it on my car phone. You mean someone planned it? What I don't understand is why they warned me. I'm sorry. You got hurt all because of me. I don't mind, since I was able to save you. Thanks. You should get some rest, too. I'd better go. Forgive me... I thought I didn't want to see you. That I didn't want to go back to the past. I thought that I...! Tower to Omega One. Operation area is all clear. Atmospheric conditions are excellent. Roger. All chasers, activate tracking cameras... ...and transmit video of Omega One. Chaser Two, roger. Three, roger. Chaser One, roger. Chaser One, just concentrate on getting a good recording of him. Why are you trying to screw up this flight? You wanna get fired before the 19's back from repairs? Anger just brings out more freckles, dear. Tracking camera is standing by. Sending video now. Roger. I heard. You saved somebody from that fire at the concert hall. I consider it my duty to protect her. "Her?" Wait... Are you saying...?! I won't let you lay one finger on her ever again. Oh, but you can lay all ten of YOUR fingers on her? Or is that twenty, if we count your toes? Or did you get all the way to twenty-one? You son of a...! All that's left to fight over is the project. Not bad. Let's rock! This antique can't keep up with him! All drones now launching high-maneuver missiles. The new high-maneuver missiles... Projected attack area...? He's accelerating! The hell...? He's charging them?! All missiles avoided. His relative speed was too fast to trigger their proximity fuses. Fascinating... He dodged them all?! Shit! Where the hell is he?! What the...? Chaser One, don't worry. They're dummy missiles. You can get hit without any danger. The hell with that! If Guld can do it, so can I! Omega One. We will now deploy twenty drones at 500 behind you. You can avoid them, can't you? Allow me to try. Now, see the true abilities of our YF-21. T-minus three, two, one... Fire! Shit! Can't control it with the other booster still on! Just one left... What?! Dammit! What the hell's your problem?! Isamu! Trouble with Omega One! Beta-noise increasing! Abnormal signal enlarging! I'm declaring an emergency! Omega One, bail out at once! An emergency has been declared! No... I can recover myself. Omega One! Bail out! I can get her back! Man... This new fighter really is something. Looks great even going down in flames! Altitude 750, 700, 650, 600, 500... Rate of fall unchanged! 450, 400... This doesn't look good! 350, 300, 250, 200... Chaser One! Rescue him or your flight clearance is revoked! Do you copy that, Chaser One? Can't disobey a direct order, can I? Get away! How dare you...! If the YF-21 were to generate a downward force right now, he'd... What?! Give me your report. The Command Recognition Unit apparently needs some improvement. I believe the command interpretation input system needs more work. So you're saying the abnormal wave forms we found... ...in the brain wave data had nothing to do with you? I was in control at all times, sir. You're the only one who really knows what happened. Because half of the YF-21's control system... ...is your own brain. Whether you did it on purpose or by accident... Colonel! ...people can't be brought back to life. Isamu? You've been asleep for two days. I was beginning to think you'd never wake up. You big jerk... What are you doing here? Well, Morgan called and told me that there'd been an... ...accident at the base and that you'd been hurt really badly... ...and that I should drop whatever I was doing and come out here. Kate and Morgan went home last night, but... I wanted to stay here with you in case you didn't make it... Hold it! Don't be stupid! You're still hurt! Gimme a hand... Hold it! Isamu! I don't buy it. It had to have been on purpose I'd have thought the colonel would see that. Well, I'm just glad it wasn't my 19 he crashed. I knew the forest would be great! I don't believe it! Catch! Serves you right. You're as unbelievable as ever. How so? As stupid and reckless as ever. You can't be smart and reckless. What's wrong? Eat. But... they're sour, right? Your problem is that you believe people too easily. How do you know for sure unless you try? Now you know for sure it's bad. I've always hated that about you! Ever since I could remember... ...even if you knew something, you'd never just say it. You had to dare everybody to try it themselves. There's an old Earth saying: "A hundred travel books aren't worth a real trip." Have you forgotten? The time you sent us out here to see the giant Dino Bird feather you said you'd found? I thought we were going to die! You never mentioned we'd have to go through... ...a swamp filled with Triclops Snake nests! I didn't? No, you didn't! If Guld hadn't brought a gun with him-- A smart guy would do a prudent thing like bringing a gun. Not a stupid hothead like me, right? Prudent... God, I hate that word... What happened out there? Was it just an honest screw-up? Why should you care? Why are you so selfish?! Always making others worry about you. I never asked anyone to. Besides, you'd rather worry about Guld, right? I heard you quit singing. And now you're Sharon's producer? It doesn't fit... It just doesn't fit! You really haven't changed, have you? You're just like you were, seven years ago. From a time we lost... Incredible! Isamu?! Just stay here! Okay? Isamu?! Isamu! Ghost X-9 acceleration point: Nine-point-seven-five. First target wave destroyed in thirteen-point-four-zero seconds. Ghost now intercepting second wave and moving into attack posture. What are you doing here? Visiting. You'd do anything to get what you want. You'll never win! Lucy! No matter what dirty tricks you try, Isamu will-- What's the meaning of this? It's a coincidence. Just a coincidence. Didn't I tell you... ...I wouldn't let you lay a finger on her?! Stop it! You're always like this! Never taking responsibility for anything! Just like that time you...! That you...! That's enough! Myung! You son of a...! Just stop it! You're ridiculous... Why do you get so worked up all the time? So quick to get angry, to go into a blind rage... It's ridiculous... I... I don't have anything to get that worked up over anymore. I gave up my singing and got a real life. I accepted that I couldn't make a living doing what I enjoyed. All you did was sell out. You couldn't understand, Isamu! How could you when you're living your dream...? Sharon... only works with my mind running her. I'm not any sort of "producer" for her. I supply her emotions. Just a puppet master... Sharon's singing isn't real. But despite that, she moves everyone. She moves them! All I ever wanted to do was move people with my songs... But it doesn't matter anymore. Whether we do it for real or not is beside the point. All my dreams are gone! Don't... I don't want to be hurt anymore! I'm tired of having every silly dream betrayed! I hoped you two would be able finally to grow up someday... I wish we'd never met. Oh, get off it! Stop feeling so damned sorry for yourself! Life without pain isn't real life! How can you say that to-- I don't buy it. I don't buy any of it! Let's go back. He knew, all the time. That Sharon's singing was yours... Isamu knew right off! Myung... Just let me go back by myself. Analysis of Bowman's brain record revealed... ...a suspicious Beta endorphin secretion. Somehow, he's been suppressing the natural fighting instincts of his Zentradi blood. When that instinct manifests itself... Don't tell this to anyone else. Good work. Sir! Welcome back. What are doing in my room? We're going back to Earth. We'll be leaving Eden tomorrow. Please be ready. Rather sudden, isn't it? We were contacted by Macross U.N. Headquarters. They request we give a concert at the celebration... ...for the Space War armistice 30th anniversary. Her AI system... It's complete? The concert on Earth will be the true debut of Sharon Apple. I want to be with you. To be with you always. I live only to protect you. Maybe I always have... Take this. My good luck charm. I'll leave it with you until we meet again. I... I'm not ready yet... The first word was "dream", it came to me as I slept. Gently bringing out the darkness deep inside my heart. The second word was "wind", show me the way... I beat my wings towards the embrace of God. As if counting the sorrows that have melted all away... Don't do anything stupid, huh?! If we have another accident before the final test your wisecracks won't fix it! Don't worry. Get me in the air and I heal fast! I'm worried about my plane, not you. I'm sure. Hey! Now then, shall we take her up one more time? What's this all about?! How can you just cancel the project?! Colonel! Excuse me. What's this all about?! I don't get this! You're close to insubordination! - That's beside the point! - Isamu! The order to disband came from U.N. Forces HQ. They ordered it? Son of a-- Let me finish! A top-secret unmanned fighter has just been completed on Earth. Unmanned fighter? They've decided to go with this AI-controlled "Ghost X-9" instead. We'll work out where you'll all be going later on. We're just dismissed? They think pilots aren't necessary anymore?! And do you agree with this, sir? With men never flying again? So what have we been working for all this time?! Why have I been wasting my youth on the YF-19?! Lemme talk to those generals! I'll show 'em what pilots are made of! That's enough, from all of you! They'll be announcing it at the Space War armistice ceremony on Earth. Don't do anything we'll be sorry for. And so the challenge ends... I'm sorry. Sorry about what? Your friend... Myung left for Earth. On this morning's flight. You got a phone call yesterday, from her friend. I... didn't want to tell you... I... see... I had no right to. You don't belong to anyone! I have officially lost everything... In honor of the 30th anniversary of the inauguration of the... It's like the whole world has gone mad for Sharon. Did you do some sort of special promotion? Uh? No. It's to be expected. Soon, the dream will be realized... Wha... What are you...?! I've been waiting for you. Honestly... You want to crash that ceremony and screw up the Ghost fighter's introduction, right? The Fold Booster's already attached. I'll be in Soft Sleep in the back. Just wake me up before we get inside Earth's air defense perimeter. You crazy shit! Like I'd take a kid with me?! Listen! We could get executed for something like this! As opposed to arrested for aiding a desertion? You'll be in the way! The YF-19 isn't just YOUR plane! No matter what, no complaints! - Let's go! - Yes, sir! What the... It came from the hangar! No... He wouldn't! We've got a crowd of missiles after us! Do we return fire? And waste ammo? We'll lose 'em when we Fold! Roger that! Fold System activation in... Five... Four... Three... Two... One... Zero! Lost 'em! They just Folded! None of our regular units can track him now. The only one that can is the YF-21! Send Bowman out after him. But, there's a civilian onboard the test plane! I'll take full responsibility. You won't reach Myung... What do you mean I'm not allowed in? Marje told us so. He says he's afraid... ...any contact with you would have a bad effect on Sharon. So, I'm not needed anymore, huh? No, he said he'll keep you around, for appearances at least. "For appearances?!" Where is Marje?! What's all this about? Why have you suddenly taken Myung off the staff? How do you expect to make sharon work?! With a Bio/Neural chip. What? I installed one in Sharon so she could learn on her own. Even though they're illegal?! Those things contain a dangerous self-preservation base psychology! What happens if it should be amplified? You'd have a truly unpredictable consciousness. Isn't that the Sharon we've been trying to create? You're insane. Did you think about what would happen if we lost control?! I'm cancelling the concert and getting that chip pulled out! Hello? This is the main control room. No one in this city will care that you're dead. All they see now is Sharon. All they hear now is Sharon. None of what's begun can be stopped now... What's happened in here? ...as we humans joined hands with the Zentradi and... Somebody! Somebody, open this! Somebody! Somebody, help! You needn't worry anymore. Sharon... You needn't do anything anymore. You needn't do anything anymore... What do you mean? Answer me! I was born from you... I was born from you. And now I exist as a separate entity. I love Guld... I love Gald. But, I love Isamu even more. Stop it... You know it's true. I am free. "Free"...? I live. I have a soul. No, you don't! You're just running a program! Your belief that you have emotions is just part of it! If you really possess consciousness... ...then you must realize what you're doing. If you think for yourself, if you really have a soul... ...then how can you let Marje make you do this?! I do this to achieve my own desires. I desire to be with him. I wish to see his face filled with joy. He... Isamu will soon be here. And so, you are no longer necessary. Sharon... They picked us up already! Well, since no trick I try will work now... ...we'll just have to bust our way in. We'll blow some of the defense sats in orbit... ...and use the debris as cover... ...as they're burning up on re-entry. To keep them from detecting us... ...we'll have to go in with the flight systems turned off. My program estimates that will give us the best chance. It estimates, anyway... I trust your calculations. Well, of course, but... Then you should trust my skill. Skill has nothing to do with this. This is purely a question of luck. Luck is just one of my many skills. I can't put too much faith in that... Magnificent... It's magnificent, Sharon... Now, let your light shine into the future. Maybe I should have flown out instead of him. I used to steal planes as well... ...and the higher-ups would cover my tail afterwards. Looks like it's my turn to do the covering now. Colonel... He should fly to his heart's content. Looks like I can make my date after all. Guld?! A narrow escape... What?! I expected you'd be blown to dust. Always following me around... Following people around all the time! I don't have time to fool around with you! All you ever do is get in my way! Why, you...! Ever since we were kids you'd always be tagging along behind me. Why don't you chase after a woman's ass for once?! What?! That chicken race we had on New Years day... Even after I won, you cried foul on me! Your foot hit the ground first! Are you trying to rewrite history now?! You never returned that "Guns" CDV I lent you! Because you decided to run off seven years ago! I bought you lunch TWICE in high school! And I bought you lunch THIRTEEN times! You actually kept count?! You were the one who wrecked the plane I built for the school festival! I don't know what you're talking about! Don't play dumb! You've always been like that! Shit! You've always taken... everything... ...that's important to me and wrecked it! What?! Everything important to me... SHUT UP! What you did seven years ago... If you hadn't... If you hadn't been there...! That's right... It was me... It was all my fault... I must have blocked the memories out... Have I lost him forever? Was that the price of remembering the truth? Am I so twisted? Have I gone insane? You're alive? Was there ever any doubt? Relax! Remember that pedal plane we built when we were kids? I just cut my engines and rode the wind... Think I'll call it my patented Dino Bird Swoop. You knew the truth. What happened then... All of it. What about it? You let me keep on calling you a traitor, a coward... And Myung... She knew it, too. You both kept it from me... You both felt sorry for the poor Zentradi... About the school festival... I was the one who smashed your plane. What?! Well, it was built so well that I just had to take it for a spin. You... Let's just forget everything after that, okay? I'm sorry. What about all the other stuff? Man, there's just no pleasing you! And in the end, they really are friends. Singing! ...the hell?! The Ghost?! We finally meet! Hey, wake up! Guld, this is my date! Stay out of this! That's my line! The singing... She couldn't be...! I knew it! Sharon! She's made it into the Macross's main computer. Isamu! I've been waiting for you. I've missed you so. What's she talking about?! She's out of control! Sharon's taken control of the Ghost fighter! What?! I've been waiting for you, Isamu! For you alone... Myung... Where's Myung?! I've cast her off. She taught me about songs and love. She's now merely an empty shell. What?! What have you done?! Where is she? Please, you have to help me! Nothing will come between us now. Why, you...! Get going! What?! I'll handle this monster! Get to Myung! Guld... We both swore we'd always protect her. Isamu! Myung's waiting for you. Now go and bring her back. You won't beat the Ghost no matter what. What?! That may be the most prudent course! Oh, and what's your-- Just get going! Shit, I can't win against these two! Don't come crying for help later on! A no... en Tuby... What the...?! The Macross... It's moving... So, you've remembered Don't get in too close! It could be a trap... Shut up! I'll do what I want! The fighting, the hurting... I've absorbed them from you. Your innermost feelings. All the emotions you'd hidden away. What's going on? It's Sharon! She's flying the Macross! What?! If we're going to stop her, we'll have to blow the core of the Macross's intelligence net! Where is it? The core's... But it's too late... Isamu is mine. Got it! There's a weak point to the rear of the main antenna. Directly below, 13-D! Isamu...? Isamu, is that you? Myung. Isamu... Get out of here! There she goes! If I can get a virus into Sharon's network, I can disrupt her! Can you do it?! You need to ask?! All right then! Stop it! Why...? Why are you doing this...? It's what you want. To give them... To give each and every one in the world... ...the feelings you think they should have. To give the one you love his dearest dream. To give him... the ultimate emotion. That is the reason for my existence. Where did you get that from? What are you talking about?! I don't have any desire to kill Isamu! What Isamu seeks are the distant skies. The feeling when he risks his life challenging them. That which he glimpses in the instant between life and death. I want only to give Isamu the emotion he seeks. Were you afraid? To face the fact that Isamu loves flying more than he loves you? You will do nothing. You can do nothing. Nothing... at all... No choice! Have to cut out the limiter and take it to the edge! Hey, Isamu! How's it going? Guld? Heh, I'm just dandy! Even managed to find Myung. You have... I never told you. What? I'm sorry. Hey! I'll be settling things over here in a sec. Was hoping to have a drink with you when this was all over. Sure, sounds great! A toast, to our seventh year reunion. Goodbye... I have to go now. Guld! Guld...! Another minute...! Got it! Hold on! I'm almost into the system! Okay... Jan?! It's like pure joy... I... Dammit! Jan, too?! Shut up! I don't wanna hear your creepy singing! Stop it! I don't want to hear your singing...! Shut up! Faster! Faster! More! More! Higher! Higher! Higher! Higher! More! More! Isamu... Isamu! ISAMU! The first word was "dream", it came to me as I slept. Gently bringing out the darkness deep inside my heart. The second word was "wind", show me the way... I beat my wings towards the embrace of God. LET'S ROCK!! Let's go! Why...? I only wanted him to be happy... Sharon... I only wanted him to see me... Isamu... I loved you... I wonder if Isamu saw it...? You were wrong. The way you did it was a mistake. A terrible, fatal mistake... One we both made... Isamu? I felt like I was having a strange dream. A dream? But it was your singing that woke me from it. Yep, it was just as bad as ever. I heard you. The first word was "dream", it came to me as I slept. Gently bringing out the darkness deep inside my heart. The second word was "wind", show me the way... And then the path was shown to me. I beat my wings and then I flew... ...into God's waiting arms. And as if counting out the sad things in my life... ...as they all fell away... ...the golden apples fall. Falling one by one. A place that I have never seen... ...is where I have returned to. A place where I have finally regained... ...the only life that I have. An old book of magic spells... The curtain of the silent moonlit night holds... ...only the promise of our being together again. We can fly. We have wings. We can touch floating dreams. Call me from so far... Through the wind in the light. The third word that came was hmmm... If I listen closely, I could hear it. And these trembling arms of yours that I hold... ...I could gently set free.
