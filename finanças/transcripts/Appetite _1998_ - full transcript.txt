[music playing] How much? How much is what? How much is a room for me and my wife? My, my wife and I. Would mind if I had a private word with your wife, sir? Don't start, Jay. I don't want you in here. What kind of a hotel do you think this is? Look, this is the last time. I promise. You're an angel, Jay. Go home, Vince. I think we're in for a quiet night. [bed creaking] [woman moaning] [whistling] [non-english speech] [opera playing] We're trying our best right here. Come, run! How are you, Wim? Feeling better. Feeling better every day. Good. You will eat it, my glorious fish? Sometimes I think you don't eat the food I make for you. JAY: Don't you worry about my appetite. Jay, chefs never eat. You can't consume the art you make. It leaves a bad taste. It's getting cold. Good evening. Shore leave. Sorry? Shore leave, like him. Have you got room for three nights? It's 20 a night for a single room, cash in advance, breakfast between 7:30 and 9:00. Theft of towels will be charged. Setting off fire extinguishers unnecessarily will also be charged. No pets. Soap is free. She's beautiful, isn't she? My fiance. But, see no evil, hear no evil, know what I mean? Not there, no, no. What, there? Good evening. Good evening. Looks like you're going to need a hand with those. Oh, not at all. Have you room for six nights? Works out cheaper for a week. A week, yes. I like this hotel. It seems-- Open? Real. Like a real place. Probably got a certificate somewhere to prove it. Would you? Do you mind if I? [banging] How was your meal? OK. I mean good as usual. Look. It's rotten. Yes. The whole hotel is crumbling. That's what happens when you get old. Excuse me. Won't be a minute. A room for three nights? [opera playing] You're the cooks right? I'd like a favor. I've got money. It's my birthday. I would like to spend it with some of my hotel friends. Friends? [music playing] [music slows] So, I didn't catch your name? Susie. Jon. And what's the birthday boy's name? So this boy stuff, I'm as man as they come. It's Nelson. Nelson? [fly buzzing] [non-english], please help me. You took his money, you deal with it. So, you here on holiday? I'm meeting someone. Special someone? You could say that. You know this song? I used to dance to it. Go on. Let's see. No, no. It's been years. Doesn't matter. Show some moves. Not by myself. [SINGING] Come in my kitchen and grab a plate. Come in my kitchen and breathe the flavor. Come in my kitchen and take a peek. Come in my kitchen and feast your eyes. Stay in my kitchen to get your kicks. We'll be tasting what you like. Come in my kitchen and grab a plate. Come in my kitchen and breathe the flavor. Come in my kitchen and take a peek. Come in my kitchen and feast your eyes. Stay in my kitchen to get your kicks. We'll be tasting what you like. We'll be tasting what you like. Good. Good? Who wants to watch me dance? Don't ever let yourself get old like me. Where are you going? To the party. You coming? I thought we didn't mix with the guests. What is it? Are you blind, sailor? It's a farmhouse. It's Godfrey's special present, his dream. He'll buy it and live there one day. Farmhouse. [non-english] [humming "old macdonald"] Here's yours, Old MacDonald? What are you saying? E-I-E-I-O. Nothing. Don't you make fun of our farmhouse. OK, invite me when you get a mortgage from the tooth fairy. Are you saying that I'm stupid, sailor? No, I'm saying you ain't got a pot to piss in. Oh, and you're a Rockefeller, huh? Compared to you two. We've got money. Godfrey shits money. In your dreams. Good evening. A room for three nights, please. Something quiet. I'm nor worried about the view. 20 a night for a single room, cash in advance, breakfast between 7:30 and 9:00. Theft of towels will be charged. Setting off fire extinguishers unnecessarily will also be charged. No pets. Soap is free. I'm hungry. Where could I find something decent this time of night? Do you like Chinese? Hey, Chinese is OK. Right out of the door, you keep walking, you're in Chinatown. All right. You don't do food here? As I said, breakfast between 7:30 and 9:00. What's the occasion? Apparently one of the guests is a year older. Would they mind if I join in? All right. Hey, sailor, another one of your hotel friends? Whose birthday is it? Mine. Have some cake. Thank you, I will. Arthur Johnson. Arthur. Pleased to meet you. To the birthday boy. How old did you say you were? Old enough. Does anyone know any jokes? I know a good story. Tell us. So. But it is not a joke. It is a true story. There's a room in this hotel that nobody sleeps in. A terrible room. Come on, give us the kinky stuff. Oh, sailor, this room is very, very kinky. It has been locked for as long as anyone can remember. Why? About 100 years ago, the owner's grandfather built this hotel. He was a, a ladies man. He had one favorite room. He built the walls double thick especially. So what? Secrets linger, trapped in those walls, crying to get out. Perhaps terrible secrets. Because when you sleep in this room, in this bed, you dream the dreams of the ones who slept there before you. You are visited by the ghosts of their dreams. Yeah, what room? 207. Let's play a game of forfeits. Lowest card sleeps in Room 207. Let someone else shuffle. Sweet dreams. [baby crying] Morning. Morning. Morning, girls and boys. Good night last night. What do you want? How well do you know the chef, Godfrey? Not very. But you've known him a long time? Yeah, since last night. I see. I want to show you a picture. Do you know him? Have you seen him around? No. Are you sure? What are you? I'm a salesman. Take some advice for free. Stay away from people like Godfrey. Why should I stay away from Godfrey? My son. My son was your age when he died. Heroin overdose. [non-english]. Yeah? Take some [non-english]. Yeah, I've got some. [non-english speech]. Yeah. [non-english speech]. Yeah, I've got it. [non-english]. Yeah. [non-english speech]. Got [non-english]. Fucking elephants! When-- when I stroke the elephants! Fucking cretin! To kiss an elephant [non-english speech]!! You fucking cretin. Are you a dog or a cook, huh? [non-english speech]. Do you want something? I'm very worried about Susie. The Chinese girl. She played, she lost. What can I do? She didn't come down to breakfast. Who slept in that room last before Susie? So you like my kinky stories, huh? Who slept there? It was before my time. But you know. What do you want? I thought I could bring Suzy some food. So you like Susie, huh? Will you give me something I can take to her? I'll tell you what, when you eat my food, I'm entering you, I become a part of you, and sometimes when I feed a beautiful woman, I watch her eating my food and it's very, very exciting. I'm an artist, but I'm for sale. Jay was the last to sleep there. The boss. The weather doesn't look so good. Greta. Here, these are the plans for the hotel. There's going to be a new, bigger living area and kitchen, which I don't seem to have, and a large bedroom, and through here I'm going to put a nursery maybe. You did these? And I've got some plans. Sorry. Why are there no faces? Well, that's the way it's done. Anyway, I can't draw people, their expressions. Can I try? [knocking] JON: Susie? Susie, please. I brought you something to eat. I dreamed I was being born and my mother didn't want me. She tried to put me back. The room, it upset you. No. It's true she didn't want me. I was adopted. I came to the city to find her, my real mother. I thought it was time. And you didn't find her? I did find her, but she didn't even want to speak to me. I decided to wait, just wait, until tomorrow 4 o'clock. And? If she doesn't come, I kill myself. She knows where I am. She won't come. The room told me that. I'd like to help. Go. Leave me. I'm going out. Man gets wound up, cooped up. Don't expect me back till late. Help me understand why. Why. [blowing] [non-english speech] You killed my son. He died of an overdose. Drugs you gave him. [clatter] You fuck fucker! You murdering muttering bastard. Jesus Christ, what is going on? This fucker's trying to kill us. You low life piece of shit! Put the frying pan down! Put it down, Wim. You are as guilty as he is. As who is? Godfrey is. Godfrey? Look, let's talk about this, mister. Put it down, Wim. Let's talk about this, Mr. Johnson. Come on. Come on. [sobs] Jay? Jay? Jay? [knock] [hums] Can I come in for a moment? You're perfect. You know, there's a joke around the hotel. Yeah? Joke about me. I'm a regular now, after all. The joke goes that I came here to kill myself, but I never managed to finish my suicide note. Is the joke true? It's cruel, but true. You old monkey swinger. Can I get you anything? Will you be all right? [door closes] Jay, we need to talk. So? You have to get rid of him. It's my hotel. I choose who I get rid of. He was attacking me and Godfrey. That's not the way I saw it. Come on, Jay. You believe him more than me? There are lots of crazy staying in this hotel these nights. You have to be strong. - Strong? What are toy talking about strong? You're a fucking junkie. I'm clean. I'm clean for five weeks. Did you sell his son heroin? I never sold in my life. You believe me? The trouble is, Wim, I trust you. I always do. I don't know whether that's a mistake. No, no, no, no, no. No, no. No, no. That much I think. You are judging me? You're judging me? You're judging me? I'm going to kill that fucking bastard. I'm going to kill him. I'm going to kill him. [banging] [whispering] [clattering] [yelling] What is happening now? Stop it! Stop! They took all the money! [yelling] Calm down! [non-english speech] What happened? They took his money! This fucker stole his money! Who stole the money? The fuck I know. [screams] Godfrey! Shh. Shh. Want my mom. Don't worry, just tell him that we'll find the person, OK? I have a very good idea who did it. Don't worry. [non-english speech] [grunting] Well? No, no, not really. What? What do you mean? What did you think? Godfrey's money. Someone's taken it, every fucking penny. Why are you changing the subject? What subject? That was my heyday, for what it's worth. [grunting] I want a word with you. Don't look at me. Come here now. It wasn't me, whatever it was. So how'd you know it was anything? I'm guessing. You find this amusing, do you? Yeah. As far as I'm concerned, your sex life ain't none of my business. What? You need to sort your fucking head out, mate. You are one sad bastard. Hello, Greta. So how've you been doing, Nelson? Well, I've been in Chinatown enjoying myself. So what can I do you for, Nelson? Well, you see, I'm back on board tomorrow. So, Greta, you tuck me in. I'll pay well. Who do you think I am? I'm not a whore! Hey, I saw you. What were you telling her? What were you telling Susie? What do you care? Tell me! We talked about suicide. Hiya, big boy. Hey look! Hey, hey, hey. What's up with him? All his money was stolen. No. Who do you think stole it? Some fucker guest. I don't know. We're on the boat, right, and the five of us are sitting on this girl naked as the day she was born, trying to own her, right, underneath this, and he comes-- And he comes in and he says, boys, if I discover you've brought pussy aboard, then you are all in the deepest shit, and if I've discover you've brought pussy aboard without giving me a piece then the shit don't get no deeper. Oh, look at it. Shut it. Wim, what is going on here? This is your thief. - That's a fucking lie. - Shut it! You shut it! The first thing he says to me when it comes down is "it wasn't me" before I even accused him. I thought you were talking about your dirty fucking magazine. - What dirty magazine? The one in your room. I nicked it, I admit it. So what? There was not magazine. Don't fucking try and stitch me up! There was no magazine! Who do you believe, Godfrey? I'm your friend. I wouldn't steal from you. I don't need his money. Next time you want to accuse me of something, you get some fucking evidence! Yeah! [knocks] [whistling] I'm ready now. I'll find who stole your money, Godfrey. Come on. Trust me. Come on. [gasps] [sobs] [ticking] [knock] [opera music] It's Can I come in? It's your room. That kid Nelson should be thrown out. Keep telling me to throw people out, at this rate I'll have no guests left. It wasn't even his real birthday. How do you know? I saw in his wallet. You saw? Look. She's beautiful. Well, I suppose. I-- She's cut out from a magazine. Where did you get it? I stole it. You stole it? Yeah. He made me angry. I went to his room and stole his fiancee. Stolen? Yeah. What are you saying? I'm not saying anything. I'm sorry, Greta. I'm really sorry. You pity me, don't you? No, I don't. Even the way you say my name. You are lonely man. I pity you. You stand behind your desk and undress us in your head. No, that's not true. You're like your father or your grandfather, aren't you, Jay? Is it true what they say about them? This is my hotel, Greta. It's my hotel. It's not my grandfather's or my father's. They're dead. That is the basic difference between them and me. The other differences, well, you'll just have to work those out for yourself. I want to ask you one question. I'm not the same as them. How did you meet your wife? Well, how else would I have met her? [laughter] There's this piece in the Bible. It's perhaps the most beautiful piece in the whole book, and it's put into the mouths of the unbelievers. It's about hope and faith at times when, when you believe in nothing. [music playing] This feels nice. Dance with me. [SINGING] It won't be long before your knees go weak. It's me you seek to swoon again. JON: The time of our life is short and tedious, and in the end of man there is no remedy, and no man hath been known to have returned from hell. For we are born of nothing and after this we shall be as if we had not been. The breath in our nostrils is smoke, and speech a spark to move our heart, which, being put out, our body shall be ashes. [SINGING] Swooning over you. JON: And our life shall pass away like the trace of a cloud and shall be dispersed as mist and driven away by the beams of the sun and overpowered by the heat thereof. Oh! For our time is as the passing of a shadow, and there is no going back of our end, for it is fast sealed and no man returneth. Come, therefore, and let us enjoy the good things that are present. Let us speedily use the creatures as in youth. Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments and let not the flower of time pass by us. Where is that cunt? JON: Let us crown ourselves with roses before they be withered and let no meadow escape our riot, for our name in time shall be forgotten. Show me you love me. And no man shall have any remembrance of our works. This is our portion and this is our lot. [moaning] [whimpers] [yells] We know who took Godfrey's money. You took my money. You took my money! Don't be ridiculous. Jesus Christ. Shut up! You're going to be singing soon enough. Godfrey, please. Godfrey! Get your hands off me! You fucking lunatic! Put me down! Please. Now you are going to take the ultimate lie detector test. No, no, please! Please! This is a clove hitch and this is an anchor bend with an added half hitch, which means, fuckhead, you ain't going nowhere. What are you doing, Godfrey? You lie to me! This is what's going to happen. You're going to dream your guilty dreams in here tonight, and tomorrow Godfrey is going to take a little nap and dream those dreams, and that way he's going to know where the money is. No. Think, Godfrey, think. You know why this room was shut up. He's a fucking liar! Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie! You know whose room this was! - You're lying! - It was her room. It was my wife's room before we were married. They left me. I locked it up because I couldn't stop! Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie! You lied to me! You lied to me! Please. [voices] Please! You lied to me! Join us. You lied to me! Shut it! Will you shut it? For God's sake, put me down! No, no, no, no! Please! Please! [yells] Do you want to see a picture of my new fiancee? No. [screams] No! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Do you want to see the knife? Here. Please. Please. Please. [screams] No! [gunshots] Tell me why. Please. Help me to understand. Fuck off! Please. You are my son and you've made me ashamed. [gasps] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. He doesn't understand what he's doing. Don't worry. I'm here now. I love you. [gunshot] Don't leave me. Please. Please, Susie, please. I can't be alone. It'll be OK. I can't! Everything will be OK. [knock] [gasps] [mutters] Godfrey! Where's my kit? Where's my kit? [yelling] Where's my kit? Where's my kit? [yelling] You stupid fellow. You stupid fellow! [thunk] [groans] You. Her life wasted for nothing. You will be judged for this, I do not doubt. She is to blame for this. How dare you. How dare you blame this on her? Breakfast, boss? [non-english speech] A meal for a king. Make sure you eat it, Jay. Getting thin. Thank you. See you later. Greta, you look fantastic. Thank you. I just dropped in to see the old place. I owe you some money. No, no, forget it. Where are you living now? Out of the city. You know, it's just so quiet. I can hear my heart beating sometimes. How do you feel? I feel wonderful. Better. And you look so different. Do you want to come with me? And live? No. I couldn't leave the hotel. You don't have to rust away all your life. My father used to say, what do you want to go out in the world? For a stay and let it come to you. And the routine is-- it's, it's in me. People can change. Yeah. Do you not think I'm beautiful now? I always thought you were beautiful. No. You're still beautiful. You, you left this behind. Well, if you ever want-- if you ever feel the need for some fresh air, just take a day out and come visit me. I'll do that. [music playing] [SINGING] Whenever we took our time, whenever we closed our minds, whenever we saw out the tired old night with a glorious sunrise. Whenever we were side by side, whenever we breathed as one. I heard a far, far deeper cry, our love was over, was always a finish in sight, right from the start, whenever we get close before we part. Whenever we spoke of love, whenever we wrong the right, whenever we tasted each other whole with desperate appetite. Whenever we broke into a sweat, whenever we embrace the fears, we hold each other half to death and still we tasted so sweet. There's always a finish in sight, right from the start. Whenever we get close, we fall apart. Whenever you smile and laugh, whenever you weep or sigh, remember i was once the only one who listened to your cry. There's always a finish in sight right from the start. And as we get close, we fall apart. Want to by some illusions, slightly used, secondhand. They were lovely illusions, reaching high, built on sand. They had a touch of paradise, a spell you can't explain, for in this crazy paradise.
