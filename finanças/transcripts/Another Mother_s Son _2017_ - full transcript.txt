Subtitles by Jancux -Get the damned Russians off the boat! - Must stay! Quicker Faster! Quicker Come on. You must not pass. - Please, I have to say goodbye. -Go then. Thanks. -Excuse me. -Doreen! -Lou. Ivy. For the trip. -Thanks. Have they said where you are going? -Because your husband has lived in England? -Because he was born there. Is there no way? Ivys Arthur was born there. You have to be classified as important - farmer, manager or something. Back! First the Jews, now the English. Who will come then? Lou, look. More Russians. What should we do? Arthur is not peasant. We will be put on the next boat. We need to talk to Brian. Excuse me, sir. - It's not that easy, Louisa. -It is. Directors are exempt, but it has to happen today. Such a promotion easily arouses suspicion. Sir, if it was just me I wouldn't ask. But that's Ivy and the boy. He is only 12 years old. They are sent to Germany. My cousin's son was locked up just because he made the V sign. The bigger reason to be helped. Like the rabbit I gave Mary ... ... and the eggs ... and the milk from Rene. -Alright. - Thanks, Brian. Maude and Lily! -What was that? - Probably dynamite from the quarry. - Poor Russian. -Ryssar? They are forced to build fortifications. Would Mr Churchill save us? -Not funny, Arthur. -I didn't try to be funny, Ivy. -You could have fooled me. -It is impossible. Thanks, Annie. Hi, Margaret. - Did you get there in time, Mrs. Gould? -Yes. Don't turn in these. -Let him get some. - He's only 12. He's old enough. It is just apples - almost just ... Cheers to the new Vice President for Jersey Post Office! Thank God! Now maybe I can sleep tonight. - Nice to see you in a suit. - You did. Stop it, boys! -Who wants more cake? -I like to take it, Lou. - Can I go out and play? -Yes, but curfew at. 22nd And don't go too far, Rex. - Another, you who are good pig? -Gladly. -How many times did Mom take you? -I got hit every time. You cried until Lou took you to the candy the store. You worked with her. -Sherbet Dabs were his favorite. -Sherbet Dabs ... The lemon flavor was the best. The BBC did, as usual, an optimist interpretation of everything last night. If you ask me, the fear is against Ruhr last week a disaster. -Did you hear anything from the boys, Lou? - Nothing from Ralph. I received a Red Cross letter from Ted. A student friend is on the same boat. But it was dated in March and Dinah hadn't heard anything either ... -Sorry. -No danger. He protects the good. Rex? Rex! Come on. Lou. It's Jess Le Cornu. She has come to the store since she was little. -Why do the girls like that? "It's so in Paris," says my brother. Gifts, extra rations ... They are too young to understand. They see a handsome face and are hungry. They are German, point out. It is the Germans we are to blame. They take advantage of them. We must not turn to our own. We know what she gets for ration today. -What then? -German bratwurst. I could kill for a cup of tea, real tea. - Give me coffee. And meat pie. - Like that mom did. -With onion sauce and mashed potatoes. -L?ks?s! - Give us the basket. Mrs. Gould ... Our Father, who is in heaven. Hallowed was your name. To your kingdom. Do your will, as in heaven and on earth. Give us our daily bread today and forgive us our sins- as we forgive they owe us. And do not lead us into temptation but save us from evil. For the kingdom is yours, and the power and the glory forever. Amen. -Ginns and Hagues were deported. -Yes, it's terrible. -You've been spared it. -Now it's all about contacts. That goes for everything. Good evening. Sylvia asked me to give you this. I didn't know if you were open. People still need to eat. -Do you need the rent today, Elena? -No danger, I'll come for the week. - Good evening, Rene. - Four shillings and eight pence. Something else? Sorry we are asking right now ... We're just wondering now that the rations have diminished ... -Do you want my eggs? -If it's not too much trouble. Your sister is so kind. She gives us her eggs. What would we do without her? What...? Back in the lead! Take some apples. Here! Here, take these apples! -It's just apples! - Stop or go to jail! You bastards! Your cold-hearted, Inhuman, sweaty bastards! What should we do? What the hell are we doing? One two three four- -five, sex, seven- - eight, nine, ten, eleven - Up! Back in the lead! Fuck the hell! If you put up with more problems you die the whole bundle! Hole bunch! Touch you! Your pig! Russian? -Fugitive? -Yes! Me too. Okay, come on. Arrived. Come on, I said. -Who is it? -Russian. Friend. What should I do with him? Friend. Kind. Russian. Annie. Thanks, Mattie. Good afternoon, Mrs. Gould. Unfortunately we have cuts again. -What do you mean? -The butter is down to 60 grams a week. This is over. I have 40 people to have their ration. -I don't decide, Mrs. Gould. -Carrefour in Le Braye got more flour. -It's nothing that matters to you. -You decide. It concerns me when I'm not can provide my people with food. Hi, Louisa. -How is it? All right with the pigs? -Yes. That's something I have to ask ... -Germans come into the shop. - He has to go somewhere. I'm often alone and some are unbrushed. -We have to stick together, Louisa. -It's too dangerous. I'm sorry. -He seems agitated. -I don't like it at all. - Leave the pigs and rot away. - They're just young boys. My brother was shot after to have jumped out of a burning plane. - Shall we show them respect? -It's just ordinary decency. -What side are you on? -You would just dare! -What do we fight for if we are the same? - Now that's enough, Elena. How we had wished that our boys were treated? Come in. He gives you no trouble. Are you hungry? Hungry? -Do you speak English? -English. Yes. No. Good. Badly. Germans. Unfortunately, this is all I have. I'm going down with this. -That's going to College House. - Then it will be a little delayed. You recognize them. They distort the writing. commandant, GERMAN HEADQUARTERS Apartment 1, 78 St. Savior Road Radio in hall closet Obnoxious. -Why do people do that? - Jealousy, fear, the reward ... It sends someone to prison. We have to... ... toss it. -We have to hand out the record, Arthur. -Yes, but not such letters. We have to do our job. I have children to think of. You got it. Make sure it is distributed. BED. Louisa. Lou. -Lou. Fjodor Polikarpovitj Burrij. -Feodor ... -No. Fjodor Polikarpovitj Burrij. -Burry. -Burrij. Bill. -Bill? -Bill. Bill. - Good night, Bill. - Good night, Lou. Open! Open the door! Open the door, I said! Open the door! If you don't open, I'll kick in the door! Open immediately! It is lit upstairs. It is forbidden. Come out! Come here! Why is it lit? Don't you understand how dangerous it is? It should be off. If that happens again it has consequences. Roger? Obvious. Sorry. It must not happen again. The boy tried to escape earlier, but got stuck. The guards dressed him naked, tied him with barbed wire and left him out all night. It happens every week. It can drive anyone crazy. But now he has you. I know it is much requested, but ... Please ... Bring your shirt tomorrow. I'll fix it. Lou? Who the hell are you?! What then?! Arthur! Stop! This is Bill. Bill? The room next door. My name is Rex. -Do you know how dangerous it is? -Yes, I haven't slept in a week. You know nothing. Some are criminals. Bill was in the Russian Air Force and he cries at night. We get a letter from the scouts. From city dwellers. You said that. They need money for food. It's not happening here. Everyone is related to each other here. A letter was just revenge. We all want to do what we can, but ... Arthur! You know how the Germans treats them. It is evil. God punishes me if I don't. Look, it's like new. He's saved you a job, Dad. -Good? -Yes good. This must be kept secret. -Can I tell Derek? -No, it stays in the family. -It applies to all of us. - I'm not stupid, Arthur. -Good morning to you! -Good morning. Nicole is as good as family. - "TOGETHER ..." -... man. -Together. -Together. - "With some difficulty." -Very good. Your brother left this, Mrs. Gould. He couldn't stop. Annie, this is Bill. -Bill, Annie. -Thank you dear. -Thanks. It's from my brother. "Harold". - Thank him. -I'll do that. -How do you say it in Russian? -Spasiba. -Spasiba. -Good. - Hi, Ms. Gould. -We have closed. It's not what you think. I love her. And I'm not a Nazi. We have closed. Out with you! Speed ??up! -What are you doing here? -Sorry. Before the war I went to school in Moscow. In Moscow, I was ... -Konstskola? -Yes. Sorry. Your mother must be so worried about you. It was my husband's. You can look into it. But don't go inside in this room. Understood? Yes. Sorry. Thanks. "Sorry," Mullvaden said, shrugging with some difficulty up. " "You probably think I'm uneducated but all this is so new to me. " "This is a river." "The river, corrected the Rat." -I'm locked, Mrs Gould. - Thanks, Annie. -Good evening. Well done, Bill. -Thanks. "And you really live by the river? What a wonderful life! " You're moving. I can't sit still all night. Wait until you're my age. Can I see it now? Do you like the song? I sang it with Ted the last time he was here. In this light ... - Look, let me look. -No. Look at that. -Bill, it's wonderful. -Is it? You made me look younger. That's what I see. You're really talented. It's a godsend. God? I do not think so. -Don't you believe in God? -Why does God let my friends die? Innocent. Children. Why doesn't God do something? There is also evil, but if you ask ... A boy of 16 years in the quarry. He begged. He prayed every night. Now he's dead. -Where is God when the Germans strike? -Bill, calm down. Slaves in the camp! When your son died! Where is God? - Don't talk about Ted. -Don't God love your son? To hell! -Don't be in my home. - To hell with God! Bill, stop! That's enough! Go to your room. You're not my mother. Bill? Bill? Bill? Bill? It's only to St. Aubin. It is close. We will be back soon. -I do not know. -Do not worry. -It's too dangerous. -Community too. You've been trapped as an animal for three months. -And if the Germans stop us? -No. It's not far. We take the small roads. That's fine. Good morning, Elena! - Cool today. -Yes, sure is it? Good morning! It's at the top, Bill. Come on! Lieutenant, I have contraband here. Come. -Next. -Good morning. ID documents. - Where did you get them? - By a friend. - It must be a good friend. -Yes, that's him. No, I think that you bought them illegally. -Where are the invoices for tomorrow? - They're on my desk. -Do you want coffee? -No thanks. I've never seen you before. Are you friends of Harold? - Lost speech ability? -He has nothing to tell you. -The price just went up. -We agreed. You have not been sincere. -You are a teacher, aren't you, Harold? -You know that. My daughter has graduation soon. She is a fly, but has been ill and need some help. -I'll see what I can do. -You have to make sure she does well. Alright. Don't go all at once. - Is the store locked, Annie? - Yes, Mrs. Gould. See you tomorrow. Good evening. -We might go to St. Heliers. -The city? Yes, there is a bus on Friday. We can walk. -You might be able to buy a book. -There are many soldiers there. -You have ID cards now. -Yes, but they hear that I'm Russian. I take care of the talk. You can learn some French words. You are my nephew from St. Mary's. Many of the farmers there hardly speak any English. Bill ... Bill, it's not good for you to be stuck here all the time. Every Friday Ivy and I go down with fruit. Relax, everything will be fine. -Good morning. -Can we look around a bit? -Obvious. -Go in. Kandinsky. I go and ask. Do you want to be kind? French. Kandinsky, please. Do you like Kandinsky? What period are you interested in? -I prefer early 20th century. -Yes. -How much does it cost? - In this state - five shillings. We'll take it. - Five shillings, Bill. In your wallet. -Oui. My nephew loves art. Good day. He has just quarreled with his girlfriend. - Thanks, ma'am. -Thanks. Two shillings six pence, please. - Are they from here? - I've never seen them before. Bill, slow down. Slow down. Relax. Nobody is chasing us. -We are looking for fish in the market. -No. We have half an hour before the bus goes. Relax. Louisa ... how's it going? That's good, thank you, Brian. -And you? -I am not going to complain. - I'm sorry about Ted. -Yes, thank you. It was a tough blow for you. Nice to see that you have some company, Lou. Why not? Good luck. Yes, I have to rush so ... Au revoir. - Does he think ...? -Yes, he certainly thinks so. -He has a big oily head. -What then? - Odd head in here who thinks ... - Dirty fantasy. Bill, big oily head! Just start walking. Do not do that. -What should I do? - Be normal. -I run. - No, then it's over. Stop! - Stop those two! -Slippery! You! You forgot this. -In the bookstore. -Thanks. Thanks so much. You are kind. Here. Bill ... is everything right? -Bill ... dear. -Sorry. No problem. Hi, Bill. -How did it go? -I need a cup of tea. - Is everything good here? - It's been quiet all day. -We should pass the month out. -Brilliant. -Can you pick some blackberry leaves? -Absolutely. - Hi, Ivy. -All good? Excuse it earlier. This warms you up. Where is Annie? Is she sick? Annie has got a job at the Summerland factory in the city. - She has stopped here. - Isn't she coming back? It is apparently better paid, though Ivy moves in until I find someone. - I have to say goodbye. -She has moved to her sister. It's getting closer. We probably won't see her for a while. -Oh dear. -It's best, Lou. -Lou. -What are you doing here? I'll be right back. A letter to you - Red Cross Letter. Thank God! - Is it from Ralph? -Yes. It says: "Dear Mom, all right. I am busy." "Hope this is so for you. Missing your sea trout. " "Up with your chin. The world sings soon again. Your beloved Ralph. " He remembers your song. - It's a good letter. -That's wonderful! It's four months old, but ... He is unharmed. I know this inside. Thank you. Come on, now we're working. I'll help you. Whatever you thought you said ' Then there will be a brighter da ' The world will sing again The bells will ring again Move it! Come on, dear. - Christmas greeting from Mr. Churchill. -I'd rather take a packed lunch. Bye! Merry Christmas! See you! Want something more? Give me five minutes. Merry Christmas! - Same, Bill. - Thank you, Elena. -Good Christmas, ladies! -Merry Christmas! Receive Mattie, Bill. - Five bottles? -Four. Hi, Arthur! -Bill! -How is it, Mattie? -Hostan? -Much better. - Come on, Arthur. Christmas begins here. -Merry Christmas. - Hi, Harold. You're right. - Up with your chin, Arthur. It's Christmas. -Rex, can you help me? -Yes. - So there. Perfect. -Come on, now we go and enjoy Arthur. -Rex, can you sing a Christmas song? -I can play one. -It will be perfect. -Good Christmas, Bill! -And if the Germans come in? - Then he goes to the back of the store. Ivy, half know his name and probably where he comes from. Don't raise my voice against me. - Hi, Arthur. Do you want to be Santa? -Gladly. Are you okay? -Yes it is. -Good. Filling? Thanks. I'll show Lou. -Look. It's from Harold. -Wait. "Merry Christmas, Fjodor. From Harold." He has written in Russian. Then so, everyone. The King's Christmas bowl. -God bless the king. -God bless Rene's pig. And for later curfew tonight and for victory and for liberation in 1944. Exemption. -Can Bill sing the Russian song? - Come on again, friend. Come on. Bill. I'm hiding the pork. -Good evening. -Good evening. - Did you party? -Yes, my family. - We heard a song. -Yes, it's Christmas. Russian song. Are you from Jersey? Do you know Russian songs? - We like them. -We have to search the property. It's Christmas Eve. Do you want to scare the child from the wits? Please step aside. Good evening, gentlemen. What is the problem? Relative? What's your name? Harold Le Druillenec, Trinity Street in St. Savior. This is my sister. My song made some impression. - Can you Russian? -I am a teacher. Never sing "O Tannenbaum" with us? Nein. We have inspections to do. -Good evening. -The same. Merry Christmas. -Harold, you're a genius. -Thank you my Russian study buddy. And Calvados. Calm down, Bill. They have gone now. And if the wrong person sees him? I have taken six letters in a month. Arthur, of course rotten apples. Lou is not in danger. -If they find him, we all go there. - Lie down, Arthur. And Ralph has already lost his father and his brother. -I want someone to do it for Ralph. -I wonder if that's the reason. Excuse me, I will not cause your family some problems. Bill, don't go. -See what you've done. Congratulations, Arthur. -Why did you say so? - Someone had to do it. You've made everyone sad. To what use? -You heard what Harold said. -As always... Bill trusts us. He just feels safe here. -Calm down... -And you're pushing him away! Merry Christmas to you all. Don't worry about Arthur. -And if he's right? -I don't let anything happen to you. -And if you go to jail? -It's no worse than alone here. German prisons are no joke. No one should go to jail. It's stupid to take risks. Rene knows where I can go. No, this is your home. It's our home. This is your Christmas present. It is an old and rare Jersey coin. I gave it to Ted once ... and now it's yours. Please, stop. Mrs. Gould, we had no dinner yesterday. You got your rations the day before yesterday. You must have some carrots. -And col? We can't boil water. - Nothing was delivered last week. I wish I could help you, but we are in the same boat. It is easier for some who has friends. We saw you get some extra bread by that Mattie. -Is it illegal? -That's enough. Take your sister home. And one more thing ... - Maude, that makes no sense. Would it feel better if I went with you to church? I'm feeling nauseous. I think I have to go out. -Lou, you forgot your shawl. -Thank you dear. Hot and go 'gives a rest! -I can go and look for driftwood. - We go together this afternoon. Louisa, do you have a minute? I want that you are moving Bill somewhere else. -What are you talking about? - Young William Dauney last week. He was deported for theft. -What does this have to do with me? - They seized all acquaintances. -La Fontaine is my property and ... - You do what the Germans want. They are sent to Germany. I'm too old for a German prison. They don't even learn to have toilets. - I'll move him. -It's for your best. What are you looking at, German? Your father was joking. How dare you say so? He was a good man. You disrespect his memory. Hold the flap, old cunt! My Friedrich didn't kill your son. -Lou? What happened? -Nothing. We are all too hungry. We need to cheer. You're one of us.
