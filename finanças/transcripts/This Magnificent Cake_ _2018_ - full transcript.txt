Fifth Chapter: The Deserter The morning Louis was to appear at the barracks, He could not be found. A suspicious farmer discovered him Scared in the frame of a barn. The police officer took pity on Louis’ parents and the situation was classified as a misunderstanding. Louis had two options: Go to the barracks the next day or go to jail for evading military service. That night, Louis read in the newspaper an announcement: a job offer in a new colony in the country. His last savings were just enough for the trip. I shall see the bottom of the barrel. Because I am a really good drinker. Hey! Hey, come back! What is this mess? So Pierre, you forgot how to open a door? Come on! Urgent! Door dirt… There is something with this door, I really do not know... Oh my God, my head ... Um, want to buy coffee? No thank you. Tell me, have you ever heard of the “Van Molle Patisserie”? Yes ... of course. Well, it was a family company. At first, the company thrived. People came from afar just for pastries. But one day my uncle disappeared suddenly. I still remember him going on my dad’s bike. Without a word to anyone. Years later, it was found in a harbor. He had taken a boat going to Africa. And the truth broke… That he had taken all our money and left us under a mountain of debt! My father's heart ... Gradually got worse and he began to drink ... We buried him last week after he fell from a tree. Want to learn something else? In my father’s papers I found the bills! Beer deliveries! In Africa! What nerve! To enjoy like that, my poor father! It must certainly be the sweet life In a beautiful and large home while The rest of my family withers! Well, I’ll go tell him two words, me! Sorry. And you? Why are you here? The Putteman’s company recruited me… Bricks. Bricks? You go to Africa for bricks? Although they have nothing more in common than being far away from home, these two young men will be good friends soon. They shared their meagre rations and drank a lot so that the endless journey would pass as easily as possible Little by little, Louis gave up his plans influenced by Pierre’s contempt for the bricks. He decided to accompany his new friend On his exciting adventure. I do not feel good. I’m so cold. It’s very cold, right? No problem Louis. I put on my shoes and we leave! Hop, hop, hop. Louis ... I want to go home. Pierre! Pierre! Three weeks later... Mother! Father! Louis! Louis! Finally! My little boy. You missed me so much! You want to close the shutters, Papa? The sun is already rising. And while Louis was sitting comfortably in his double bed He thought back to what had happened He thought of poor Pierre And the strange way he had returned home. He could not find an explanation for this… Maybe at his awakening. Maybe, he thought, It comes from a royal invitation. The king would probably be very interested In his African adventures! And before falling asleep, Louis heard the King announce: Louis, You're a good boy. A very good boy. The End
