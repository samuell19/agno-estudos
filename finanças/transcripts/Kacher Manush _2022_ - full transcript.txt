Open the door. Open the door. Can't you hear? Open the door. When will you give back the money? Are you kidding us? Open the door. Open the door. Do you think this is a joke? Open the door. -Brother! -Open the door. Brother! Brother! Please, save me. Brother, I owe them money. Brother, they will kill me. Please, save me. -Babai, listen to me. -Brother, please, save me. Nothing will happen. Nothing will happen to you. Listen to me. I am here. Babai. Move aside. Don't touch Babai's body. I didn't understand. You gave your word that you will save Babai by hook or by crook. Mom, trust me. I didn't understand that Babai would... Babai! Move aside! Brother, I am done. I am going. Kuntol! Do you have a lighter? Brother, do you have a lighter? Huh? Here. I just need a smoke. My back is against the wall. I failed to turn around my life. That’s why I’m leaving everything and going away. I couldn’t take care of anyone. -I have to atone for that sin. -Hey! This is my letter. Give me my letter back. This letter is dramatic! Wait, let me read a bit more. God, please, forgive me. Yours, Kuntol. Why are you acting crazy, brother? I’m acting crazy? Yes, indeed. Watch now. You shouldn’t touch the collar. You shouldn’t touch the collar. You shouldn’t touch an elder person’s collar. Leave my collar. Give it back, give it back! I am telling you for the last time. Hey! What’s going on here? Hey, what’s all this? What’s going on here? Get lost! Get lost from here! Or I’ll hand you both over to the police. Listen. When is the next train? Why? Do you want to commit suicide? In the last two months we got two similar cases. Hey, if you really want to die, just go somewhere else. No, no! We just want to travel together, that’s all. There are no trains for today and tomorrow. Oh. Repair work will be going on for two days. Okay. Understood? Now get lost. Take this. Hold this. What’s wrong with you? My brother, Babai, was a chit fund agent. We invested all our savings in that scheme. But one day the chit fund went bust. It was only because of you that your father got insulted in public day in and day out. The man who never borrowed a single penny from anyone else had to endure unspeakable insults only because of you. Mom, mom... what... You get lost. Just get lost from here. Get lost. Yeah, right. Every fault is mine now. Hey, Babai! Why are you getting angry now? Damn you! What Babai? Mom, had your money increased through the chit fund scheme, wouldn’t you have wanted to build your own house? What is he saying! Wouldn’t you have said that? Mom, let me... What are you saying? Brother? Didn’t you say, that you want to start your own business? Didn’t you say that, tell me. Calm down. You said it. You also said it. You all are bloody selfish! Hey! It’s sort of okay if we get punished for our own mistakes. But say someone you love gets angry on you and punishes himself, can you forgive yourself then? What do you mean? Babai! The younger brother who used to hang from my back while playing was hanging from the fan in front of my eyes. Mom tolerated her husband’s death. ...what happened to you? But couldn’t take her son’s demise. Her whole body got paralysed. After Babai’s death the creditors stopped barging into our house. But every brick in the house was pointing its finger at me to say it was all my fault. I get it. Guilt plus exhaustion plus hopelessness plus depression equals to this train line. Correct? But if you die, who will look after your mother? You said you live in a rented house. If you die, your landlord will throw your paralysed mother out of the house. Mark my words. Please, pay my bill, too. Whatever money I had in my pocket I gave it to the auto driver last night when I came to the station. Goodbye, brother. And, hey, please, lend me twenty rupees. I mean, I have to return home. And there’s no sugar at home, have to buy that also. Twenty rupees. Thank you. So brother, may God bless you. Brother, how much is the bill? Twenty rupees. "Singing" Jeevan Ashan! Saroj Da? Hey, Mr. 420! What’s up? Who are you trying to deceive today? Why are you talking like this? You know I needed money back then. Yeah, every thief has his needs. Anyways, what are you doing here? No, that new policy…here…Jeevan Ashan. Has this policy been launched in the market yet? I’d like to sell that policy. Really! You already stole the premium from two clients and got kicked out from your job here. Who are you trying to deceive again? You? Yeah, here I am. How did you come here? Didn’t you tell me this morning that you live in Aatabagan? So is it very difficult to locate a handsome man like you in Aatabagan? I brought home-cooked food for you. Yeah. Come on, come on, let’s go meet aunty. Aunty, I am Sudarshan. Sudarshan Ghosh, Kuntol’s new friend. Did aunty eat yet? Yeah, I fed her. Good. Come on, let’s go eat. See, what all I have cooked for you with my own hands. But why, that’s what I can’t understand. I am here to make you understand that only. Life is easy, what say, brother? Really? So how did life go from being impossible to easy within the span of a few hours? This is the Jeevan Ashan I am talking about. An insurance plan. Here, see. The annual premium is not too high. Just fifty thousand rupees. You have to pay the premium for five years. Then another five years for the term to terminate. Really? And at the end you get a sure return of five lakh rupees. It’s double the money. Great! That means you are not committing suicide anymore. So you want to buy this policy, right? You’re very intelligent! Yes, I’m buying this policy. Not for me though. But for you. For me? Yes. Who are you to buy a policy in my name? Hello, sir. I am Sudarshan Ghosh. I am a small-time insurance agent. When you buy the policy, I will get a small commission. And when you die, I will get the death benefit. Just a minute. Death? Benefit? What does that mean? Suppose you start the premium and die in a sudden accident, then that’s it! Your nominee will immediately get ten lakh rupees. Careful. Careful! If you die because of hiccups or poisoning, you won’t get a single penny. Your death has to be accidental. Accidental! Here, drink some water. Listen, brother, you just have to sign the policy papers. And nominate my sister for it. Your sister? Where did she come from now? What do you mean by where? My mother, Late Girijabala Devi, gave her birth from her womb. Actually there’s a hole in my sister’s heart. What’s it called…Atrial Septal Defect. She needs a major surgery within one and a half month. It will cost five lakh rupees. Okay. But why should I die because you need money? If you need money for your sister’s surgery then buy a policy in your name and nominate your sister for it. Good option. Possible. But if I buy a policy in my name, I will have to die. My sister is sick. Will she be able to run around with the policy papers on her own? Then get a mediclaim in your sister’s name. What are you saying! Kusum already has a hole in her heart. No company will issue a mediclaim in her name now. Don’t you have any house or property? Can’t you get a loan from the bank? There wouldn’t have been any problem in that case. Actually our house is a family property. There are too many disputes. Neither can I sell it, nor can I mortgage it. You’re the only way out for me now. Trust me. Honestly. Oh, God! Just a minute. There you are, Kuntol. You were supposed to return me my money today. I couldn’t arrange the money today. Listen, there is a guest in the house. I’ll definitely pay you next week. I promise. Wow! You took twenty-five thousand rupees for your mother’s treatment. And now you are using your guests as an excuse to not give me my money? Quiet. You cheater! Next week, right? Remember. How long can you survive with these money issues? Isn’t it better to just die? From the ten lakh rupees that Kusum will get after your death I will take only five lakhs for the surgery. The remaining five is yours. I will repay all your debts with that money and keep the rest for your mother. Look, even if you work very hard, you can’t arrange so much money for your mother. Can you? You can’t. The greed for money is a dangerous thing, Sudarshan Da. What’s the guarantee that you will remember my mother after getting so much money in your hands? I swear on my sick sister. I guarantee. Listen to me. It’s getting late, Sudarshan da. I have to give my mother her medicines. Listen… Your food was amazing. Now it’d be better for you to leave. Please, listen to me. Listen, I’ll wait for you in that same train line at the crack of dawn. I’ll return home, if you go there. But if you don’t, I won’t return. Mom... Mom! Why did you have to be so careless? I was coming back for you. I’m prescribing an injection. You have to get it by tomorrow. How much will they cost? Three thousand per piece. We need four pieces. That means... twelve thousand. It’s urgent. Don't be late. It is very important. Only those with zero pennies in their pockets know the value of zeroes. Twelve thousand has only three zeroes in it. But in five lakhs… There are one two three four five zeroes. You can’t get so much money for your mother even if you try all your life. Actually, you couldn’t believe me. You’re making a mistake, Kuntol. Because of you… Your mother is sick because of you. But I can’t see my younger sister die after raising her all her life. Goodbye, Kuntol. Will you look after my mother for sure? What are you saying, Kuntol? You’re going to die for my sister, and I won’t look after your mother? Huh? What are you saying? Where will you get the money? He isnʼt listening. Who? Contractor Sen. He is too arrogant. He claims to know the MLA. He claims to know the MLA? Do one thing. Hold him at gunpoint and ask who all we should invite at his prayer ceremony other than the MLA. Ask him not to threaten me with the MLA or I will teach him a lesson. And tell him I will put a JCB in front of his house all day and keep it running. Should I kill him with a brick and bury him in the sand? Yeah, you can do that also... Hey, Khoka, you havenʼt grown up at all. When will you grow up? Is it right to say all this in front of outsiders? Wonʼt they get afriaid? Thereʼs nothing to be afraid of, Mr. Ghosh. Nothing to be afraid of. Actually, this guy is new in the area, you know. He has been trying to rebel, thatʼs why I thought of teaching him a lesson. Thatʼs good. Youʼre threatening him with the very thing that youʼre trading in. This is a unique idea, definitely. Isnʼt it, Kuntol? Now letʼs get to business. Yes. So now that youʼre taking the money, how will you return it? Neither do you have a house nor do you have a car. What will you sell to get the money? My brother, here, Kuntol. Iʼll sell him. Youʼll sell your brother, Kuntol? What do you mean? I mean there's a policy called Jeevan Ashan. I will buy it in his name. Then Iʼll get ten lakh rupees as soon as he dies. Meanwhile Iʼm borrowing just... Iʼve studied till the eighth grade. But still it never hindered my work. I can manage everything properly, but right now Iʼm having trouble understanding what this Jeevan Ashan is about. Please, explain in details. Yes, yes, definitely. This is my job. Look, here. So thatʼs how your money doubles in ten years. Wow, this is an amazing thing. Khoka! Yes, sir? Khoka! Yes, sir? I couldnʼt give you anything till date. But now I will. Yeah! Get the Jeevan Ashan policy done in his name. He is alone in the world. So keep me as his nominee. So are you happy? What happened? That wonʼt work. His life line is very long. He wonʼt die easily. No no that wonʼt work. Better you increase your interest rate from ten to twelve percent. Actually... I donʼt care about the actual amount. Iʼm just concerned with the interest. Iʼm good as long as the interest increases. Sir, listen to me. Okay. What do you mean? Hello? Why did you let him raise the interest by two percent? Two or ten, how does it matter? The interest has to be paid after a month. But will we need a month? I just need a few days to... How much? Let's say... Seventy... One lakh. One lakh. Done. Here is your fifty thousand. Keep it in your pocket. So, why did you take thirty thousand extra? A prayer service for my father and brother. A physiotherapist for my mother. And donʼt we have to get a nurse for my mother? Okay. But if something untoward happens? You started the game, Sudarshan Da. How can you run away now? Let's go. Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey, friend! You can do it. No, it’s not possible for me. Hey hey hey hey hey hey, what will happen? You will lose. No... Give it here. Sudarshan da, mom loves to eat aloo posto and kolai daal. ...is unpredictable. Will you remember it? Why are you crying? ...is for anyone. Hail Gandhiji. Count it. Sometimes life is like an uninvited guest. Hey hey hey hey hey, friend! You can do it. No, it’s not possible for me. Hey hey hey hey hey hey, what will happen? You will lose. Hey, brother. No... While you're still here, do one thing... ...select a photo of yours. Photo? Why? Hey, brother, don't I have to hang a photo of yours after you die? Don't I have some responsibility? We will face whatever comes. The streets will get painted... ...with unspoken words. We will move on from the past and learn. And fight till the last. We don’t have much further to go. Hey hey hey hey hey hey, friend! You can do it. No, it’s not possible for me. Hey hey hey hey hey hey, what will happen? You will lose. No, what if I die? Hey hey hey hey hey hey, friend! You can do it. Adarmin. This is to be taken after the lunch. And this is before going to sleep at night. Here is your prescription. Rs. 570! Last time it was around Rs. 450. Yeah. But I just have a 500 rupee note with me. Do you have PhonePe? -The server is down today. -How much do I have to pay? Rs. 230. Shit! What will I do now? Yes. Did you set out yet? No no, Iʼm about to. Iʼve come to buy medicines for mom. I'll give them to her and set off immediately. Hey, give me the change. Then keep this. Please, hurry. Yes. What? You donʼt want this? No, I donʼt have the money. You should have said that earlier. Now Iʼve to redo the bill. Thereʼs all that GST issue, donʼt you understand? Please, adjust my change with her. Iʼm in a hurry. Hey, wait. Thank you so much for helping me like this. Please, give me your number. Iʼll send you the money through Phone Pe. Yeah, tell me. Listen, those with excess money in the bank have all these phone wallets. But I donʼt, madam. Itʼs Aalo. Not, madam. Kuntol. Then Iʼll meet you one day and return the money. No no, thereʼs really no need for that. Itʼs okay. Please, I insist. This is not right. The way you just paid for me. Tell me your number, please. 98744... Thank you. One minute. Yeah, tell me. Kuntol, hurry. Saroj Da will be leaving soon. That means our work might get held up till Monday if he leaves before you arrive. Weʼll get late by two more days. Yes. Yes. Iʼm done here. Iʼm coming. And, listen listen, take all your documents in the bag before setting off. Okay? Yeah yeah. All my documents are in the bag. What about the other people in the queue, are they all done? Yes, they are done. Come fast. Okay, Iʼm coming. All the best. You must have a job interview? You just said there are other people in the queue before you and youʼve put all the documents in the bag. These are all common things in an interview. Itʼll go well, youʼll see. Saroj Da, hereʼs the money. Your client looks innocent. Donʼt deceive him and spoil our companyʼs reputation again. You paid the money today so the policy certificate will be ready within two-three days. Iʼll let you know as soon as I get it. Sign it, brother. Sign. Here here. At least weʼre done with one task. Yeah, the signature is done and now the funeral is left. Anyways, whatʼs our next plan of action? We have to find a proper suicide spot. Not a suicide spot, brother. Accident spot. We need an accident spot. Accident. Right you are. So now we have to decide when and where the accident happens. Next Wednesday itʼs my birthday. And here I am looking for a suicide spot. Can you imagine? Next Wednesday? That means there are seven days left for your birthday? Thatʼll be amazing! What do you mean? Hey, letʼs finish the auspicious task on an auspicious day. I donʼt understand. William Shakespeare, the painter Raphael, the actress Bergman, and Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, they all have something in common, you know. They all have their D Days on their B Days. Itʼs called birthday blues. You should also become a member of this club. You mean the birthday and the death day should be the same? Right? Yes, brother. Now wait for seven days and then you can suicide. Hello? Hello. Whoʼs this? Itʼs me, Aalo. We met in the medicine shop yesterday. Oh, yes yes. How was the interview? What interview? Oh yeah yeah. Interview. It was good. I got the job. I knew it! After all, you saw my face before leaving. The interview had to go well. But why do you sound like youʼve been sentenced to death? Anyways, listen. Meet me at the medicine shop around 4-4.30. I go there for some tuition classes. Iʼm getting the fees today. So I can give you your money back today. Today? Today... I canʼt make it today. Itʼs a new job. Thereʼs a training today. So train as much as you want. Then come. You never know when you miss the chance. Let me see. There you go. “Let me see” means youʼll try. And thereʼs nothing man canʼt do if he tries. Okay, so weʼre meeting around 4.30. Hey... Come on, come on... Oh, God! Come on, come on... Come... This train is standing right now. But suppose you fall off a running train. Thatʼs it. Itʼs written here: Do not lean out. It means donʼt keep your body leaning out of the train. Imagine! Indian Railway is also giving us ideas about how to commit suicide or get into an “accident”. No. Train cancelled. My body wonʼt stay in a single piece if I fall off the train. Nonsense! One piece two piece or three piece, what do you care? You wonʼt be coming back to see yourself. Youʼre impossible, really! Here, hold this. Let me show you. Suppose you lean out lightly like this, like a parachute. Like this. Then the crowd in the train will do the rest. The body is adaptable... Hey... Sudarshan Da... No... it doesnʼt adapt to everything! Oh, God! Why are you laughing? Itʼs better to just stand inattentively in front of the train with a cycle. Oh, God! My leg is broken. Letʼs go. Are you committing suicide? Iʼll tell everyone. -Suicide? No! Weʼre just hanging out, right? -Yeah, we're hanging out. Am I a child? I heard what you were saying a while ago. What did you hear? Give me a 100 rupee note or Iʼll tell everybody. -Who? -Who will you tell? Who will you tell? Him. Hey hey... Oh my God! Listen listen... What are you doing? Hereʼs a 100 rupees. Now do whatever you want with it. You gave me a torn note? Guard uncle... guard uncle... Quiet! Quiet! Wait wait hey... Oh my God! My leg is gone. Thatʼs why I asked you to cancel the train. Shit! The appointment with Kusum's doctor also had to be scheduled for now. I bought an ointment and a pain killer for you. What did the doctor say? The surgery has to be done within 3rd August. One of Kusumʼs ventricles is completely damaged. Her heart can fail any time. We canʼt keep it hanging any longer. We just have 24 more days in hand. No no. Itʼll be okay. But shouldnʼt we take a second opinion on Kusumʼs matter? Whatʼs the point? He is a good doctor. No. Thatʼs okay. But this is such a major surgery. I feel it will be safer to take a second opinion. I know a doctor. If you give me Kusumʼs reports, I can show them to my doctor once. No need, I said. Iʼm her brother, I know whatʼs best. Heʼs interfering so much. Oh. Hello? Listen, Iʼm... Youʼre coming, right? Listen, once you cross that medicine shop, youʼll reach Hedua bus stand. Iʼm waiting there. Youʼre still there? No, I mean, itʼs almost 5.30. So what? I have to return your money today. Actually I canʼt sleep, if I borrow money from anyone. You donʼt have to worry. Just come. Iʼm waititng here for you. You can take your time. Whom are you going to meet? A friend owes me money. Really! I thought you can only borrow money. You can lend also? How much is it? Seventy. Seventy rupees. Seventy rupees! Youʼre one rich guy. I demand a party for this. Hey, auto. Oh. Hi. Finally you came! It's your money. Take it. Was there really any need to go to so much trouble? A debt is a debt. Big or small. No one can defeat you with words, no? Correct. But are you always this silent or is it because of me? What! I am talking to you, arenʼt I? This is called talking? So whereʼs your new office? Outside. Iʼll be joining after seven days. Outside? You mean outside Kolkata? In another state? Much further away. Abroad? Wow! You can say that. What does that mean? Donʼt you know which country? The company hasnʼt told me that yet. Weird. But you know itʼd be so cool, if any of my acquaintances ever went abroad and brought gifts for me while returning. I wonʼt be able to return much. Oh, thatʼs why youʼre sad. If you get too sad, take a transfer. Whatʼs the problem? No transfer. No office politics. This job is permanent the moment you join. Thatʼs great, right? I also want to work abroad like this. So yeah, you helped me yesterday and I owe you a treat for that. You have four options. Phucka, jhaalmuri, egg roll, and fritters. Choose one. No, thereʼs no need. Choose. Egg roll. Letʼs go. You get the best egg roll here. Wonʼt your girlfriend get angry, if she finds out youʼre out eating an egg roll with me? No no. Iʼm single. You? Me, too. So who all are there in your family? At my home? Just mom and I. My mother is paralysed, thatʼs why I had to take this job. What! Then why are you leaving your mother alone and going abroad? Who will look after your mother? Oh. I have a friend. Heʼs almost like an elder brother to me. Whatever it may be, you shouldnʼt hand over such a huge responsibility to someone else and run away. I need to go. I havenʼt given you a news yet, mom. Iʼve got a job abroad. The pay is huge. I can clear all our debts now. I can get you treated properly. But donʼt get afraid once I leave. Do you remember Sudarshan Da? Mom! He said heʼll look after you. He is a good person, mom. You are happy, no? Give a bit more masala in the paan. Yes, giving. Give that masala. Give that masala. Yes. Give some betel nuts also. Okay, Iʼm sorry. Hey, why are you apologizing? Look, I know I talk too much. I must have said something to hurt you in the evening, no? I canʼt relax without clearing the matter. Are you still angry on me? You make paans for me daily now. Reduce the sweet masala. Please, give some zarda. Actually the thing is... that job... ...is not to your liking, right? Yeah. Actually I am the one who should apologize. Yes. You shouldnʼt abandon your friend in the middle of the road without any notice. But just a “sorry” wonʼt do. You deserve a punishment. Here. Okay, whatʼs the punishment? If youʼve got time tomorrow, you have to meet me again. You said youʼre here only for seven more days. So we have to finish this meeting as soon as possible. Okay, Iʼm hanging up now. Iʼll call you tomorrow. Is there someone beside you? Yes. Okay okay go. Let me know if youʼre coming tomorrow. You canʼt stop laughing. Who were you talking to? Just a friend. Friend! You didnʼt have a friend, thatʼs why you were so sad. Forget it. Give me the paan. Come fast. See you tomorrow at the same place at the same time. How’s your leg? I bought a bottle of alcohol from the local shop while going back home last night. Just drank that and I was fit in the morning. And I wasted my money on buying your medicines. Don’t get so sentimental about it. I’ll take those medicines, if I ever need them later. That way I’ll get to remember you, no? What do you mean? You’ll forget me once I’m gone? Rubbish! Why are you saying such rubbish? Why are you dragging Ganga into the sewers? Focus on the task at hand. This is option number two. Suppose a high tension wire from the transformer comes and touches your hand. That’s it. You’ll be finished in a few seconds. You’re a piece of work! Is the transformer a packet of chips that it will be lying on the road and I’ll come and pick up the wire? There’s no reason for me to climb up on the transformer. You’ll climb up to die, of course! Will it look like an accident then? Come on, didn’t we all climb walls to retrieve our kites when we were small? When we were small yes, but not at this age. No one climbs walls to retrieve kites at this age. Right. That means accidents have to be classified according to age. Correct? Correct. It can be done according to age. It can also be done according to seasons. Like for example, burn cases happen during the Kali Pujo time. Snake bites during monsoons. And your plan can work around Biswakarma Puja. But not now. Listen. I’m getting late. I need to go somewhere. Where are you going? We’re here to find a suicide spot and not a picnic spot that you can leave midway hoping for tomorrow. I mean... mom... Have to give mom her medicines. Rotna Di is there at home. Yeah yeah. But she said she has to leave early today. So if I don’t return, how will she leave? I can’t leave mom alone, no? Then when are we meeting tomorrow? I’ll let you know at night. I’m in a hurry. Oh. Is it your habit to get late? Sorry. Is it your habit to say sorry? No no. Actually I got held up at the training. Then I wasn’t getting an auto. You’re such an innoccent man, you know. Everyone is going to exploit you. Why? See, we all get late at times. Why do you have to give so much explanation for that? Oh. One minute. Hello? You won’t come? You should have said that earlier... Leave, let me see. What will I do now? What happened? I was supposed to meet another friend after meeting you. There was something I needed her help with. But now she says she can’t come. Now what will I do? I don’t have much time. What do you mean? Don’t get so serious. One of my friends is getting married. I have to get one sari for her and one for myself. But I can’t select saris on my own. So my friend was coming to help. But now I don’t know what to do. Hey, you’re free. You can come with me and help me out? Me? Yes. No no. Please. I’m in a hurry. It's urgent. Come on. Nothing will happen. Just take this as your punishment for coming late. Thanks. I donʼt understand all this. Why do you have to? Just tell me what looks good and what doesnʼt. What if you donʼt agree with my choice? Why do you have to worry about my choice? Just tell me what you like. So be it. This shop. Hello. Hi. How are you all? I am crazy Ayantika. Do you want to know how I am? My condition is just like a soggy papad in the monsoon. And the reason for that is obviously my love life. You know what, age is inversely propotional to love. The more your age increases, the lesser options you get for love. Random people just don't make the cut. You hardly like anyone at the first glance. It's age that's responsible for this condition. We become casual and make do with whoever we get. But sometimes we do see someone and feel like trying once again. Sometimes we do feel like becoming serious once again. Sometimes some people do make us feel ah... like our heart is still accident prone. So we're forced to return to that person by the rusted feelings in this magnetic heart. Pack this. Yes, you will look very good in this saree. Should I show you a Zardosi? Show that one, please. Yes yes, I will. Kuntol I got the policy certificate. If you had told me earlier, I could have accompanied you. You said Rotna Di wonʼt be there at home. Then how could have aunty stayed alone at home? Listen, Iʼm going to your house with the policy papers right now, okay? Hey, listen what will I do with the insurance papers? You keep it with you. Iʼll take it later. No no Iʼll just take a bus and come. -Pack that one. -Okay. Iʼm sorry. I have to leave right now. Iʼll call you later. Iʼm sorry. Listen. Thank you. Please, hurry. Iʼll get in so much trouble if I get late. Please, go fast. I am going fast only. What were you doing? Iʼve been ringing the bell for so long? Stomach ache. I was in the toilet. Come on, letʼs go inside. Did you get gas? Yes. That's good. I thought you might have committed suicide already. Why would I commit suicide? What do you mean by that? You have to commit suicide. No no. I mean why should I commit suicide so early? Let the time come. Iʼve got another good option for your suicide. Where? Suppose we drop the apple from high up this bridge, like this... Oh no! Go go go... So what was that I dropped off the bridge? An apple. Why? This one in my hand is an apple. And the one that fell was you. Not possible. I have vertigo. My head spins if I look down from a height. Think of something else. What else will I think of? I am the only one whoʼs been doing all the thinking for the last few days. Hey, Sudarshan Da. Donʼt get so upset. Hey, come on do you want to have an egg roll for lunch? Iʼve found a fabulous eatery. Hello. Itʼll take some time for my classes to get over. Just come over. Iʼll text you the address. Okay. Iʼll set out once I have lunch. My goodness! Youʼre repeating the same thing to two people at once. Youʼll be greater than me one day. What do you mean? You just need an excuse to get out of the house, no? Come on, go inside. Hi. Hi. Miss? Yes? Can I ask you something? Yeah. Is that your boyfriend? You have become so naughty. Just finish your homework for me, okay? Now go inside. Okay okay. You have a date, no? Best of luck. So? Are you going to run away today also? No. I took a friend for lunch and we were having egg rolls at the place you showed me. And there I realized the egg roll doesnʼt taste good without you. Thatʼs why I packed mine and brought it. Weʼll share it together. Do you have a problem with that? Messed up emotions. Let's walk and eat. Songs of chaos. You mute all of that so my tired senses get some relief. Sometimes I think I am late. I might not get someone to love. I’d thought I’d never Auto. No, it's okay, you can go. We have to walk a long way. So? If we walk while chatting with each other, it'll seem like a small distance, trust me. We'll reach there soon, come on. far away the hearts stay they will meet like magnets one day. Listen can’t stay alone, can’t stop sticking to each other the magnetic hearts. Can’t stay alone, can’t stop sticking to each other the magnetic hearts. I can listen to all your complaints. I can listen to all your complaints. You can hold my hand and help me cross the road. All the unspoken pain that is hidden in my heart, you can listen to them if you want. This heart can’t stay alone, can’t stop sticking to each other the magnetic hearts. Can’t stay alone, can’t stop sticking to each other the magnetic hearts. All the damned worries run away on seeing you. When nothing is right why does my heart keep thinking of you? Sometimes I used to think I got late. I won’t get someone to love. I’d thought I’d never fall in love. But again that same nuisance. Listen to what I am saying. An anonymous poet has said no matter how far away the hearts stay, they will meet like magnets one day. Can’t stay alone, can’t stop sticking to each other the magnetic hearts. Can’t stay alone, can’t stop sticking to each other the magnetic hearts. Sudarshan Da... Finally you got time. Huh? Neither were you answering my calls for two days, nor were you meeting me. Where were you? Iʼve been meeting with some of my old friends before leaving. Where were these friends when you were in trouble? And now suddenly they are all coming back! And listen. Here is the fourth option. Imagine that youʼve entered the water to bathe. A tide comes. And you get pulled away slowly. But in order to prove this as an accidental death there must be water in your belly. So do one thing. Get in the water and gulp some water immediately. Okay? Hey hey. Are you okay? Are you all right? Why did you save me? What? I donʼt want to live anymore. Hey hey wait. What madness is this? -Yeah, Iʼve gone mad. -Okay, listen... Let me die. Shut up! Calm down. Six years of our relationship. And then I find out Nil has been with Mili for the last one year. Great! So you came here to commit suicide because of that one guy? Your parents, your work, your dreams. Canʼt you live with all of that? Itʼs so easy to say all this. If this had happened to you... What then? My girlfriend left me when I lost my job. My father died suddenly. My brother died in front of my eyes because of my fault. My mother is paralysed because of me. Thereʼs no work, no money. Even I feel like dying. But life is not about running away. Life means trying. Everything will get well with time. Live for yourself. Live for your parents. Live for your dreams. Just live. Life is not about running away in defeat. Drowning is out. When Goddess Durga and Goddess Kali did not learn to swim, why did you have to learn? Huh? Saw a beautiful girl and had to jump in the water. Listen, Sudarshan da, I have to go home. You have to go home, why? Rotna Di... again... This Rotna Di of yours is so irresponsible. Huh? Who knows whoʼs being irresponsible, Sudarshan da! Come on. When is your flight tomorrow? The company didnʼt give me the ticket yet. But I suppose itʼll be a late-night flight. Then letʼs do one thing. Meet me tomorrow at the Hedua bus stand around five. Weʼll celebrate your birthday. And you can head to the airport directly from there. And Iʼll go for my tuition class. Please. Please. No, I mean, if weʼre really never meeting again then letʼs make our goodbye memorable. Okay. Why did you have to take up such a job? Weʼve been friends only for a few days, so you may not take me into consideration. But how will you live without your mother? Thereʼs no other way. What do you mean by that? We can always find a way if we try. Remember I told you that? You wonʼt be doing this job from your heart then how will you be happy doing it? Can money alone make you happy? You need your loved ones, too. Anyways, leave all this. Weʼre meeting tomorrow at five. Come on. Aalo! Aalo! Are you all right? Rotna Di, please, bring me a cup of tea. Coming. When did you come? Coming. Oh. Rotna Di, you're here? Where is Kuntol? You were supposed to leave early today. No. Actually Kuntol sir did come back home in the afternoon. But then he went out again. So how could I leave? No, Rahul... my friend... he... You shouldnʼt lie, if you donʼt know how, Kuntol. I made the rules of this game, remember? Are you trying to double cross me? Iʼve got a good plan. What? Getting hit by a car on a busy road. This is my champ! What a brilliant plan! Who says that we are ever truly gone? I donʼt understand why we get sad over death. Who says that we ever truly die? I donʼt understand why we get sad over death. If we all die, If we all die, who will be left on earth to atone for their sins? Who says that we are ever truly gone? Different permutations and combinations of the five basic elements have created each one of us. One soul breaks down into two. The source of all souls has no death. The source of all souls has no death. Once the soul finishes its purpose that its born with it leaves the mortal body. Once the soul finishes its purpose that its born with it leaves the mortal body. Life and death are the names of businesses that God conducts with our lives. Who says that we are ever truly gone? I donʼt understand why we get sad over death. Who says that we are ever truly gone? The formless God is playing his games from his heavenly abode. And we are alive only because of his blessings... only because of his blessings. The one who is the eternal truth is the one running our mortal bodies. Without his blessings my body would become weak and lose its use. Where are you? You haven’t been answering my calls for so long. Won’t you come tonight? I have to leave. No no. I can’t go today. I’m stuck somewhere. But yesterday you said this will be our last goodbye. I don’t want to say goodbye. Bye. Hello? Hello? The water that comes from the ocean runs through the river. The water always returns to its source of origin. The tide comes and goes but the ocean never dries up. Similarly we come and go, says the ascetic. Who says that we are ever truly gone? Hello? Where are you? What do you mean you won’t commit suicide? What will happen to Kusum? What will I tell Sadek? Everything will work out if we try. You’re talking as if there’s money lying on the road. You know my sister will die if her surgery is not done on time. That’s your responsibilty. Not mine. Didn’t you remember that when you took money from Sadek? You didn’t hesitate to take money for your mother then. I’ll return the money later. Later? Later? Later when? After my sister dies? Does your sister really exist? I mean, we know each other for so many days now. But, you didn’t introduce us. What do you mean? What was the policy manager telling you that day? You think I didn’t overhear? You have been stealing the premium from your clients all your life. You’re a number one fraud. Don’t I know that? And now you’re talking about your sister? When I asked you to get a second opinion, you didn’t. You think I don’t understand what’s going on inside your head? You think I don’t know that once I die you’ll steal my policy money and then my mother will be thrown out on the road? Anyways. From today, your sister’s responsibility... Enough! If that’s what you think about me then you better leave. Leave. Just leave. Damn it! -Do as I say. -Phone. Hello? It’s me, Sudarshan. Mr. Ghosh, I’ve come in your area for the election campaign. How’s the suicide going? Kuntol won’t commit suicide. What? How will you return my money then? We have to kill Kuntol, Mr. Sadek. Inform Khoka. Did he go home then? How would I know that? Do one thing. Go to his house directly. Who are you looking for? Hi. Did Aalo come for her class today? No. Miss cancelled the class today. Hey, can you tell me her address? Yes, yes. Got it. Make sure that it looks like an accident. This must be the house. What are you doing here? No, I mean... I know what you mean. I didn’t get you on the phone. Oh. I listened to my heart, Aalo. I left my job abroad. I won’t go anywhere. I’ll stay here. For mom. For you. Happy birthday. Thank you. Brother! "Singing" I didnʼt lie about my sister. Now do you believe? Sorry, Sudarshan Da. Actually... Iʼm also sorry. Look at our neighbour, Mr. Bose, and his daughter, Nandini. Sheʼs about Kusumʼs age. But she is getting married and then she will start her own life. Whereas my sister... You know, Kuntol, I didnʼt marry or think about my own family because I wanted to give my sister a good life. But I failed. Trust me, she never said a word to me about her illness. My sister is like that only. Friendly. Lively. She wants to put a smile on everyone’s face. But she never shares her pain with anyone. Listen, I didn’t tell her anything about the surgery deadline yet. Don’t you go spilling the beans in front of her. Sadek’s call. I asked him to kill you. If anything happens to my sister... What will happen to me? No... What are you saying about me behind my back? I was saying that Nandini is getting married today and then she will go to her in-laws house. A few days later you will also go to your in-laws house. Can you manage everything on your own over there? I’m there. I mean, I’ll be there. Aalo! Kusum! Isn’t that Aalo’s brother? Yes. My brother told you about my illness, no? Did you mind that I hid the truth from you? Don’t talk so much, dear. Please, get some sleep. When I was small if I ever got hurt, my brother would cry on my behalf. I can understand how much pain he must be in on seeing me like this today. Would it be right for me to cause you pain as well? Fine, you keep talking. I’ll leave, okay? You know, the doctor has said I’ll die, if I don’t get operated. You know everything? But Sudarshan Da... ...didn't tell me anything. I overheard when he was talking to someone over the phone. You took a good decision by leaving that job. No matter what happens don’t leave your mother alone. I’m lecturing you when I’m the one who’s about to... Aalo! You’re the one who taught me we shouldn’t abandon our loved ones midway. Everything will get all right. You are not leaving us and going anywhere. Now try to sleep, please. The surgery’s on 3rd August. After the suicide it will take nine to ten days for the death benefit to be released. That means... That means you have eight days to commit suicide. 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th. I give your these four days from the remaining time. Arrange the five lakh rupees for her. I’ll take care of Sadek’s debt. But yes, there’s a condition. You can’t disturb Kusum again. Disturb? You mean I can’t meet Aalo again? No. I won’t let her suffer for a doomed relationship. Brother! Even I don’t want her to suffer. Do what you want. But just remember, Kuntol, Sudarshan Ghosh might be a simple insurance agent, but in order to save his sister he can kill if needed. Without flinching. You have the 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th. If you can’t get the money by the 20th, I’ll get on the field from the 21st. Come, the doctor is leaving. How is Kusum, doctor? Arrange the money, Mr. Ghosh. We have to move before it gets too late. Give the bag to me. Come. Dada! Do you feel better? You know, sometimes I really worry about you. You worry? Why? How will you manage alone once I’m gone? Gone? Where will you go? Huh? I won’t let you go anywhere. No! When we were small dad used to say that he’ll get me married and make my husband stay with us. Do you have the same plans? Then Kuntol might run away, okay? Where will he run? I won’t let him run away. I won’t. I won’t run away with your money. Please, I really need the money, Subir. I understand, Kuntol. But I don’t own the coal mine. I am just a manager here. Let me see if I can manage something. Please. Please, try. Sir, the mon... Hey! I'm putting the money here. Leave. Yeah, you hang up. I’ll try. Honestly, I don’t have the money, trust me. Otherwise I wouldn’t have turned you down. I sanction the loans in this bank but am I the one making the rules? The common people are just supposed to get promises, right? But the loans are reserved only for the rich. Only they will get the loans. And then even if they don’t clear those loans, nothing will happen to them. In fact, when they go to watch cricket matches on foreign lands, the event will be covered live. Look, there’s no point in telling me all this... I know there’s no point. But who else will I say all this to? I’m in such a state that I don’t have anyone else to talk to except myself. As long as you live it’s all about struggles, rejections, losses. Poor people only get votes, but they don’t get notes in their pockets. Will you stop? I’m giving you an advice. Listen carefully. Find a job. The minimum salary has to be twenty thousand. Bring me the offer letter. I’ll sanction your loan. Just like a vehicle runs on wheels. Just like a vehicle runs on wheels. ...runs on wheels. Similarly life runs on money in today’s world. Similarly life runs on money in today’s world. The more money you put in your pocket, the emptier it seems. The more money you put in your pocket, the emptier it seems. ...the emptier it seems. Life runs on money in today’s world. Life runs on money in today’s world. We set out for work the moment we wake up from sleep. We set out for work the moment we wake up from sleep. To earn our living. And get pressed in the daily grind. Poverty burns our bellies. Life runs on money in today’s world. We can’t give you more than twelve thousand right now, Mr. Sarkar. Twelve? Life runs on money in today’s world. Hello, I applied for the post of an accountant yesterday. We have hired someone else, Mr. Sarkar. I call on God to say how precious life is. Oh, God... God says both the rich and the poor meet the same fate in the end. What will you do by knowing the price of life? What will you do by knowing the price of life? People are busy looking down on the beggar even when he is dying of hunger. People are busy looking down on the beggar even when he is dying of hunger. Why does the soul die even as the body lives? Look, my baby is on the way. I have to be very careful right now. Okay, even if you can’t give me money, could you at least get me a job in your company? Shyamoli! I’ll talk later. ...life runs on money. Just like a vehicle runs on wheels. Just like a vehicle runs on wheels. ...runs on wheels. Similarly life runs on money in today’s world. Similarly life runs on money in today’s world. Similarly life runs on money in today’s world. Similarly life runs on money in today’s world. Oh, God... Oh, God... Yeah, say... Brother, come home quickly... Taxi... taxi... taxi... taxi... taxi... taxi... You are funny. There he is. Come on, brother, freshen up. I’ll serve the food. Hey, you relax. Let me do that. You’re the one who did everything. Let me do this much. Get well first, then do all this. Why did you have to call me like that? I got so scared. Kuntol has cooked fish for everyone. I called you so that we could have lunch together. Now go and get fresh right now. Even in the middle of so much financial crisis I bought the fish, thinking of Kusum’s health. And you have cooked a spicy dish with that fish, right? A light fish curry with papaya, without too much spices and oil. It’s good for the health. You only taught me this. And the fish you bought that’s still in the fridge. I bought this fish with my money. Oh, because you can’t arrange the money, you’re planning to become a house husband by cooking like this, right? Didn’t I tell you to stay away from Kusum? I asked Aalo to send me her reports on WhatsApp. I know a doctor. I showed him the report. They prescribed two new medicines. So I came to give Aalo those new medicines, that’s it. I raised my sister on my own. If I could do that for her then I can also buy medicines for her with Rs.150. Sudarshan Da! Please! Lower your voice. This is reality. And this reality is much bitter than the medicine that you bought with Rs.150. We don’t have much time in hand, Kuntol. You have to arrange the money. And, listen here is the money for your fish and the medicines. Now go. Go. Where is Kuntol? He... His mother’s nurse called. His mother has fallen ill suddenly. That’s why he left in a hurry. Is it something serious? No no. Nothing serious. Sit. It’s getting late. Have your lunch. Sit sit. Eat. Kuntol cooked all this, and he only had to leave. It’s just so sad. I know it’s sad. But what to do? It’s too late. Come on, open your mouth. Eat. Oh. Check if it tastes all right. I know you can’t eat food cooked by anyone else except me. This curry tastes just like yours. Almost as if he has cooked this after learning the recipe from you. No! How is Kuntol supposed to learn the recipe from me? You talk too much. It’s too late. Open your mouth. Eat. Eat. Ridiculous! No no, we can’t talk to that Ghosh respectfully anymore. The more politely we behave the more he is trying to harass us. Just imagine his audacity. He has switched his phone off. He is very cunning. He fools his customers and now he has become habituated with that. Now he thinks we’re also fools. This is the benefit of working in sales. Yeah. They don’t let us understand what the real truth is and what resembles the truth. Okay, listen, you do one thing. Yes, sir? When he comes... Kuntol has become very busy, you know. He’s just not getting the time to call. Brother, did you like Kuntol? Hey, why are you not talking? Are you angry on me? Did I do something wrong? Who can judge what’s right and what’s wrong? Everything is circumstantial. Oh, no! There is too much of loadshedding these days. We have to sit in the dark again. Oof! We have to find light in the darkness on our own. You didn’t do anything wrong. And maybe what I am about to do is not wrong either. I promised my sister that I’ll get her well again. That poor girl... That poor girl is growing so weak, you know, aunty. How can I let her fall silent, tell me, aunty. Forgive me, aunty. Ticket ticket ticket ticket... Get your ticket... Hey, mister... Hey, sister. Here here here... We’re approaching Dharmatala... All those who will get down here, come forward. Stop stop stop. Hey! Pick him up. Are you all right? Hit him. Hit him. What's the matter? Do you know him? Don't leave him. Hit him. Don’t let him go. How dare you push someone from the bus? Where do you live? One minute. Wait. Leave him. Hit him... One minute. Let him go. What are you saying? Please, you all can leave. I know him. Please, you all leave. These must be pickpockets. Otherwise why would they push each other off the bus? Ridiculous! Come on, get on the bus. Come on. Get on the bus. Come on, move. Move move. Have you lost your mind? Yes, I have lost my mind. I have lost my mind. It’s been four days. You could not arrange a single penny. Could you? Then why didn’t you kill yourself? Why didn’t you commit suicide? Tell me. I won’t commit suicide, Sudarshan Da. I will arrange the money. Look, Kuntol, whether you arrange the money or not, I will arrange it. Don’t get complacent just because you got off today. Who knows you may try to turn on the gas at home one day and it might explode; you may try to turn on the switch and get electrocuted because of a short circuit. What then, huh? You have gone mad. Yes, Kuntol, I have gone mad. If you don’ t die, my sister can’t live. I can’t let you live, Kuntol. Once you finish talking, drink the milk. It’s warm. I’m going out... One second. Where are you going? There’s some work. Yes? Getting a job is not so easy. Why are you worrying so much? You got such a good job in a foreign country. And then you left it on your own. And now... There’s some noise coming from the Sarkar’s house, no? Yes. -Let’s go and see. -Let’s go. Electric pyres are cheaper than wood? Oh. You mean wood is a better option? Then I’ll take the wooden pyre for my friend. Is it possible to proceed without the best option? Huh? Nothing will happen. Wait wait. What happened to her? She was playing in my courtyard. Got electrocuted. She’s injured badly. She has to be taken to the hospital right now. Please, inform her father. Everything will be all right. What happened? I’m here. Everything will be all right. -Nothing will happen. -Let’s go. You? That means you... Have you thought once about what you’re doing? Aalo is sick. What if God punishes her for your sins? God has only one job, right? Keeping tabs on our sins and good deeds. But when he sees us in need, he’s silent. When sees us in pain, he’s silent. When I cry for my sister all night, even then he’s silent. But when someone commits a small sin, he wakes up to punish him. Why can’t you understand one thing? When you lay a trap for others, you end up falling in that trap yourself. That small child... Who did that small child lay a trap for? For whom? How did she get trapped in our mess? Kuntol... Kuntol... Actually we’re puppets. We’re just puppets in God’s hands. We dance the way he makes us dance. The only job of a human being is to reach his goal, that’s it. You’re wrong, Sudarshan Da. You’re wrong. You will have to atone for this sin one day. The interview has been going on for so long. Hey, do they give the salary on the first day itself, if you give a good interview? No no, how can that happen? Who knows! All kinds of weird things keep happening nowadays. Hey, how much experience do you have? Me? Four-and-a-half... Oh. I have six months experience. A little more than you. I have four-and-a-half years of experience. Huh? Oh. Then I’d better leave through the same door I came in. Hey, no, please please. You know, I’ve been circling out the job ads so frequently in the newspapers that those circles have become imprinted on the bedsheet. Still I didn’t get a job. Think! Maybe I won’t even be able to get married. My future father-in-law has said his son-in-law doesn’t have to be good looking, but he must have a good job. Imagine. Sudarshan da? You were right, Kuntol. You were right. I got punished for my sins, Kuntol. -Everything... -What happened? ...is ruined, Kuntol. I failed. Sudarshan Da... I mean... Aalo... Is Aalo all right? Can you... Come to our house if you can. For the last time, just come here. Hello? Hello? Sudarshan Da? Aalo? Is Aalo all right? He... Please be quiet. Silence please. Sorry. Aalo! Why isn’t she picking up the phone? Mr. Kuntol Sarkar! Huh? You can go inside. Brother, what’s your name? I am Samar Dutta. Samar, all the best. For your wedding. What! What do you mean? Hey, the money? How much is it? -Rs. 200. -Keep the change. Hey, listen, Kuntol, I am... Aalo! My goodness! So? What’s the matter? No phone calls, no nothing. I thought you might have taken up the foreign job again and left without telling me. Brother, say something. Uh... Uh... Your brother only called me, right? You called? But you didn’t say anything to me. No, I mean... I only urged him not to tell you anything. Actually, your brother wants to cook fish curry for all of us today. Really? You should have said that earlier. Okay, now that he is here, let me go and cook the rice. You come quickly otherwise it’ll get late. I’ll be inside. Bad luck! Another miss! Actually there’s a saying. If God saves you, no one can touch you. Keep trying. Your acting is not bad. But try to come up with a better plan next time, okay? Potato... Brother, is everything all right? You go. I’ll take it up from here. Call me if you need anything. Yeah, you go. -Have you checked the bill properly? -Yes, I did. Yes, sir? Why is the house locked from the outside? Where are you? Uh... Sudarshan Da went out with your mother. One minute, one minute. Sudarshan Da came here? Yes. Mom... Do you know where he took her? Oh, no! That I didn’t ask. Okay, listen. You wait. I have an extra key. Come fast. Yes. Look, aunty, your son is calling. Actually he is very worried about you, you know. Here I am, trying to remove all his worries, then why is he worrying so much? Why aren’t you picking up your phone? Your fight is with me, okay? Don’t drag my mother into it. If anything happens to my mother, I won’t leave you. I got very late, no? Let me open the gate quickly. Oh, no! I got very late in doing the evening puja today. Please, forgive our sins, God. Where are the matchsticks? Rotna Di! What happened? Open the doors and windows. Why? Stop here. Leave. Enough is enough. Don’t make a mistake like this again even by mistake. I’m a peaceful person, let me be so. The extra house key... Give it back. I have asked Rotna Di not to open the gate again, if you come. What’s the fare? Kuntol Sarkar? Hi. We’ll let you know if there’s another opening. Hello? Are you busy? I have some urgent work with you. Yeah. Everyone calls during an emergency only. Anyways, say. Are you done insulting me? Now let’s get to the point. The senior accountant in our office died two days ago. With your experience and qualification you should get this job. If you want, I can refer you. Yes yes yes. Please please. Great. Then I’m fixing the interview around 2:30 tomorrow. My boss’ secretary is also trying to push her brother for this job. He has an appointment at 3:30. Don’t get late. Come on time, please. Sure sure. I’ll be there. Listen, I mean, I have a request. I mean, if I get the job, can you give me the appointment letter immediately? All that can be arranged. First, you come tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you, Shyamoli. Thank you so much. Oh, God! Oh, God! Coming. Is Mr. Ghosh here? Please, call him once. Hey, what are you doing here? Go inside. Go. What are you all doing here? What else can we do, sir? It's been too long. Come with us once. Mr. Sadek has called you. What’s the matter, Mr. Ghosh? You also had to cheat me? Why won’t people stop trusting each other, tell me. I will give back your money within a week. A week? You mean seven days? Okay, if you don’t pay on the seventh day, you won’t get to see the eighth day. Understood? Please, have faith on me. To hell with your trust! When it comes to business, I don’t even trust my own father. Anyways. Leave leave leave. Seven days, okay? What happened? What are you thinking? Plan C. What? I’ll come back soon, okay? Yes, dear. I’ll go to meet you as soon as the interview gets over. Say around three or four. I’m feeling very sad today, you know. I wish you didn’t have an interview today. Why? What happened? Are you feeling sick? Today in the morning... I had a bad dream. Mom used to say if you share these early morning dreams with others, they never come true. But what if it comes true? No, silly! All this is just superstition. They don’t really happen. Anyways, I’m getting late for the interview. I’ll meet you after that, okay? Yes. The number you're calling is not responding right now. Brother? Yeah? Did you talk to Kuntol today? With Kuntol? Today? No. Why? Nothing. He was just supposed to come. He must be stuck at work. I’ll let you know, if I get in touch with him. And you do one thing. Take your medicines and get some rest. So? You? Your head hurts, right? Sadek’s goons hit you on the head. How am I supposed to prove that as an accidental death? That’s why I have sent them away. And now I’ll do whatever needs to be done. Get up. Get up. Do you know what you did? If I had gone for the interview today, I could have got the job. And the bank loan also. To hell with your job. I’ve been hearing your excuses for too long. Now you will do what I ask you to do. Get up. Get up. Get up. Leave me. Why can’t you understand? I’m trying to save everyone, Sudarshan Da. I’d have really got the job today. To hell with your job! Damn your job! My sister’s face has been floating in front of my eyes all day. Why don’t you understand? If you don’t die, my sister will die. Come on. Come on. Sudarshan Da, listen to me. You will have to die. Brother... brother... listen... Come on. No no... Didn’t you say you have vertigo? If you fall from here, your heart will fail even before you touch the ground. It will help me prove your death as accidental. Come on... Kuntol! Leave! Please, don’t do this. Let me go. Please. No, Kuntol. Who do you love more? Yourself or Kusum? Who do you love more, tell me. I love you, too. Brother! I will make everything all right. No, Kuntol. No, Kuntol. I won’t let you go. No, Kuntol. No, Kuntol. I can’t let you go. I can’t let you go. Otherwise my sister will die. I can’t let you go. You have to die, Kuntol. You have to die. You have to die, Kuntol. Brother! Sorry. Sorry. Save my sister, Kuntol. Save my sister. How did this happen? I slipped while going for the interview. What am I supposed to do with you? I lost. I lost, Aalo. I couldn’t take care of you all. This last job also... How can you accept defeat so easily? Don’t we have to spend our whole lives together? Isn't it? You know what you mean to me. If you lose, I’ll lose too. Don’t let that happen. Everything will get all right. When we were small dad used to say that he’ll get me married and make my husband stay with us. Do you have the same plans? Then Kuntol might run away, okay? You know, mom, I didn’t get the job that I went for today. Everything is getting over, mom. I feel as if I am losing. Babai also left because of me. You’re also in this condition because of me, isn’t it? And there is Aalo. Heaven knows what will happen to her. Mom, I have really lost. I don’t know what to do. Now there’s only one way out. Brother... Brother... My tablets have finished. Brother... Forgive me, Kusum. The most important thing for me is seeing you get well. Sadek Da is my friend. I have kept my policy papers with him. When he gets the money from there, he’ll pay for your surgery. Kuntol knows everything. I’m leaving. This story is yours and Kuntol’s now. I’m leaving him for you. Sudarshan Da, we haven’t chatted for so long. I’ve tried being angry on you. I thought if you try to hurt me again, I’ll hurt you too. But then I told myself that we both have the same fight. To save your Kusum and my Aalo. Actually I wanted to live with Aalo, for Aalo. Not without Aalo. My brother died in front of my eyes. But I won’t let you lose your sister. So I’ve kept the policy papers on my bed. I’ve also left the extra house key with Rotna Di. Take them. And yes. I forgot to pay for two cups of tea. I know you’ve separated our accounts, but if you can, do pay Hori Da for the two cups of tea. Once Aalo’s surgery is done stick to her. And another thing. If Aalo asks where I am, tell her I took the job abroad. Take care of mom. Bye, friend. I have a long way to go. Take care of yourself. I am a misfit. Tell me why I should stay. If you love me, set me free. If you love me, set me free. I am a misfit. tell me why I should stay. If you love me, set me free. If you love me, set me free. My roots have been through thousands of storms. The soil which holds me has become weak! I’m taking up the space that the gardener needs. So call the woodcutter to chop me off. Wishes have spikes and thorns. They’ve bruised my heart. So many friends are out there. But only a few are truly our own. Let me go now. Why do you let the pain increase? If you love me, set me free. If you love me, set me free. Brother! Brother! Who are you? Leave me. Brother, this is me, Asha. Can’t you recognize me? I am Asha. No no no. If I don’t die, Aalo will die. I will have to die. Brother! Brother! I’m doing well, you know. But the man who showed me the right path is choosing the wrong one today. Sudarshan Da must have got my message by now. Aalo also. Call them and let them know you’re fine. Kuntol, look after my sister. She won’t be happy without you. It took me time to realise that. Anyways, I bought a policy in my name this time. Mr. Sadek! Sadek is the nominee. He will give you the money. And if you can, forgive this helpless brother. You both stay well. Bye. From deep within the heart, though you may deny, a sickness is spreading, throughout the body continuously. Do you have any idea where Sudarshan Da might have gone? ...is just a habit. Why are you laughing? It’s better to just stand inattentively in front of the train with a cycle. That which has no beginning has no end. Let me go now. Why do you let the pain increase? If you love me, set me free. If you love me, set me free. I am a misfit. Tell me why I should stay. If you love me, set me free. If you love me, set me free. Sudarshan Da! If you love me, set me free. Hey! What’s the matter? Neither will you die nor will you let me die. Why? Why? Why didn’t you let me die? Because you knew Aalo can’t live without me. Similarly Kusum can’t live without her brother. That is something I know. I want to live with you all, but I don’t know how, Kuntol. I don’t know how. Aalo isn’t picking up her phone. I tried calling her many times. What! I am very worried. What! Let’s go. Kusum. Aalo. What has happened, do you think? Huh? Kusum. Aalo. Aalo... Aalo, open your eyes. Let me see. Wait. I’ve her washed her stomach. But we need to operate immediately. Please, go and talk at the reception. Sir... The money has already been paid at the reception. Doctor, you can start the surgery. Okay. You are? Bikash Sengupta! A very big industrialist. Sir, what are you doing here? I’m an industrialist later. My first identity is that she is my daughter. Sorry. I called dad and told him everything on the phone without taking your permission. Thank you, sir. Thank you? You’re thanking me? It’s me who should thank you. You gave my daughter back to me. Can there be anything bigger than that? Thank you. Thank you so so much, sir. Aalo! Where is my brother? He is here. I’m here. Brother! Brother! Here I am. What were you both trying to do? Everything will be all right. Everything will be all right. I’m here. Relax. Relax. My goodness, you had us all so worried, Aalo Di. Aalo, this is Asha. And he is Asha’s father, Mr. Bikash. He is the one who paid for your surgery. No no. You can’t introduce me to Aalo like this. Let her get well first, then all of you come to my house. Sir, we can never repay your debt. No no. You have to repay my debt. You both come outside. I’m waiting. Come. There's something to discuss. Look, I’m a businessman. so I do every business deal very carefully. Let’s start with you. If you have any wish to commit suicide in the future then I’ve got nothing to say. Understood? Otherwise there is an opening for the post of a senior accountant in my company. I want you to do this job. The choice is yours. Okay? Thank you, sir. And, you are? Sudarshan. Sudarshan Ghosh, sir. Sudarshan Ghosh, yes. I want to get a group insurance for all the employees in my company. And I want you to do this. But there is a condition. Make sure that the survival benefit should be greater than the death benefit. That means you have to make sure that life is more beneficial than death. Am I clear? Yes yes. Completely. Completely. No no no. If I try, I can still compete with both of you. Completely. Was it too much? No no no.
