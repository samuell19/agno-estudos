SPANISH MUSIC [narrator] Beauty is when something ordinary is transformed into art. The art in football is that it can transport you out of your daily world: the tough, the boring, the repetitive, and into the ultimate theater. Grecian plots and narratives of validation or tragedy played out in real time, without divine narration or script in front of the eyes of its emotional shareholders. Sometimes it delivers. Sometimes it doesn't. That... is part of the game. However, once in a while, people, places, and circumstance play out through the vehicle of football to conjure up narratives so rich they transcend the paradigm and leave a lasting impression on history. Barcelona '72. Colin Stein scored one, Willie Johnston two. Tragedy, redemption, unjust defeats and unimagined triumph. Ancient lands, and the spirit of the tribes that inhabit them of rivalries and heritage, European invasions, and corridor presentations. Chaos, comedy, and the transformative powers of the beautiful game. Stories like these come once in a lifetime, and they deserve to be told. [commentator] You wouldn't find this in Milan, you wouldn't find it in London, You wouldn't find it in Munich or in Lisbon, You wouldn't find it anywhere else in Europe. Glasgow is... fucking mental. ROCK MUSIC but really good. Glasgow is my home, the best city in the world. Glasgow... it's a working class city. Our whole culture is about proving ourselves. I think we have to battle for our existence, but mostly in the industrial age through... deprivation. Damp and dank tenements. Most of them on their way down, for a regeneration of the city so it's very, very different, Glasgow in early seventies than what it is today. I think football has been... a saviour. It lifted people, and gave them the opportunity to dream. To me... life. It lies at the heart of our community. Living in this city, you either support Rangers or you support Celtic. You don't choose to be a Ranger, you're born a Ranger. The Rangers mean everything to people like me. After your family, Rangers are always first. The Old Firm is just, it's the biggest game. [fan] A massive occasion, across all the fans there across the world. It's the biggest fixture in the league. It's got religion, it's got politics, it's got everything about it. People know me as a Minister, but many more know me as a Rangers fan. The vast majority of Rangers supporters is Protestant. The vast majority of Celtic supporters is Catholic. [commentator] It wouldn't be the same at the Rangers Celtic match, if opposing supporters didn't clash. I'd never been to an Old Firm game until I played in one. In them days it was a 50/50 split with the fans. It was bitter, and it was angry, and it was aggressive. And the capacity crowd settle back to watch the battle of the giants. The two greatest rivals in British soccer. There's certain pubs that are Ranger's pubs, and certain pubs that are Celtic. Don't go in the wrong one. If you do that, then you won't come out again. It's just a mad city and I better watch what I'm doing. And when you mention 'Old Firm' it means: Violence. Disturbance. Trouble. Trouble. Terrific atmosphere. My best pal was a mad, keen Celtic supporter so we would hurl abuse at each other for 90 minutes and then meet up later. It's just your neighbour, it's just like a 90 minute... rant. Back in the days it was a bit rough but it's not like what it was, it's calmed down now. They were also competing against each other to become the best in Europe. CROWD CHEER Glasgow is a... it's a rough city. It's a hard city. But it lives and breathes football. When Scot Symon was manager of Rangers, Celtic couldn't buy a victory against them. They reigned supreme. And then in March 1965, Jock Stein came along. DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC He developed a different kind of spirit at Celtic Park, and Stein started to win things. So that was a problem for Rangers. Celtic were the dominant team, and it was Jock Stein who was putting all the pressure on Scot Symon. CROWD CHANTING Scot Symon never really recovered from the Berwick result. Rangers needed to win trophies, Berwick at the time of course, were bottom of the heap in the Scottish game. Expectations was so high because Rangers were league cup holders at the time. So there was the big Rangers against the wee Rangers and it should have been a walk in the park for Rangers that day. But it was a disaster. I don't think they were playing at their full potential. I mean, I think there's a lot of good players, individual players, and I think the team thing was lacking a wee bit. The disaster of Berwick, that shadow was cast over Ibrox and Rangers football club for a long, long time. That marked the end of that era. CROWD NOISE Scot Symon was eventually sacked. TENSE CLASSICAL MUSIC Davie White comes in. Different character, more of a tracksuit manager, a kind of a new breed. Davie White was good. Tactically, he was very good. He's actually reached a European semifinal in 1969. I think a quarter final as well, both in the first cup. But when it gets to the 1970 Rangers they're still in second place, but points wise they're really falling behind. In actual fact, Davie White, he was hands at the training and he had a good football brain. But his biggest letdown was he didnae come over as a Rangers manager. To us he was one of the boys like, you know, and... he didn't have the authority that Symon had. He couldnae handle some of the players, because he was still a young man and he couldnae handle the older boys and they were nae respecting what Davie White was saying. And I think it was probably the right job, maybe just at the wrong time. I think Davie White was a good fit for Rangers, but Rangers is built on success and one thing that you're not allowed, is time. You have to get it right immediately when you're given the responsibilities and the keys of Ibrox park. And Davie White was looking for time that just wasn't there. We actually were doing quite well in the league, under him, but he still got the sack. You know. For all the good work that might have been done on the training field, and behind the scenes, and the modernisation that was going on... it just wasn't translating. Which is why, eventually, they turned to Willie Waddell. SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC Any ex-Rangers would be looking for that job, especially Willie Waddell like. Wi' Willie Waddell, you've got a man there who is the most important figure in Rangers' history, arguably. He's played for the club. Well, Willie Waddell was a Lanarkshire man, and he had come up the hard way in junior football. His debut was against Partick Thistle when he was like 15. As a reserve player, he gets farmed out, he comes back, in his first game in the first team he scores the only goal in the game against Arsenal, in what was then a kinda established, prestigious, pre-season friendly, in the days before European football. And he was powerful. He was a powerful player. There was no jinkiness about him, it was thrust. Dynamic play. Ball up the wing, ball over. The Second World War comes in, he won infinite trophies during that period. But because it's all during the Second World War, it's, you know, it's not counted. It's unofficial. He knows about hardship as well, he knows that it's... everything is hard won. CROWD NOISES When I first met him it was when he had left football altogether. DRUM MUSIC Willie Waddell, who was a journalist at the time, kept hammering Davie White in the press. Oh he was slaughtering him, every week. He was very critical of Rangers and him obviously being a hero Rangers player. He wasn't happy. So eventually, for some reason, he got the job. Was it deliberate? Was there, you know, maneuvering behind the scenes? I'm not so sure about that. I think it was inevitable that he would come back to the club, whether it was manager or whether it was a different role. It seemed like that was kind of written in the stars. SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC Gravity took over, and he was sucked in, and he couldn't refuse, and Rangers supporters began to look out their scarves again. It was quite clear that the journalist from The Daily Express... had turned into a titan. UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC an entirely different animal altogether. When he came in, he was quite ruthless shaping the squad that he had. Big players, the likes of Jim Baxter, Willie Henderson, weren't part of that blueprint, probably not decisions that 99% of the fans would have made. But he made those calls. He brought in some new players, He brought in some new players, and some of the old guard was... was released for the club. So that was a big change at that time. He was a tough man. You never ever argued with Willie Waddell because there was only going to be one winner... it was him. You did what you were told. If not, you were out the door. That was a turning point, Waddell seeing that change that was needed. The fans were demanding it. He was different altogether he wasnae a... a tactician, or nothing like that, he was more of a... disciplinarian. Discipline was everything, you were a Ranger 24 hours a day. You had to behave. You lived by that tradition, you know. Every morning: collar and tie. And once you're a Rangers player You're always a Rangers player. Conduct yourself in the right manner. I fell out wi' him quite often. He wouldnae listen. He wou- You didnae have a say. It didnae matter what you said, he was always right. SLOW DRUM MUSIC He could sit in the dressing room and argue with three folk at same time. In his office, up at the top of the marble staircase, he had a traffic light system on his door. And there was an 'Enter' and 'Wait' outside the buzzer. So every time you went up, and pressed it, it would be 'wait.' So you's are standing there and you're wondering what he's want to see me for. You know, and he always perched his glasses on the edge of his nose whenever he had something to say to you. Right son, I want to tell you something. And that's when you knew you were in trouble. [laughs] And that was his trademark. UPBEAT LOUNGE MUSIC I remember one time, I went up to sign a new contract, and he offered me... basically the same money, and he just comes out, "You don't really mean it" I went, "Well I tell you what, the money's getting made at the wrong side of the table here." And the next thing he's got me up against the wall [gurgles] "Hold it! Hold it! Calm yourself!" ROCK MUSIC He wouldn't let you away with anything that incurred his displeasure. And he could tell you it straight, as he always did. So I'm pressin' the buzzer. 'Wait.' 'Enter.' So I goes in. And he stands up, he stands up, he goes, "what did you do?" He says, "did you sit on the ball?" I says, "no I didnae sit on the ball!" I says, "the elastic on my shorts broke, and I had to bend down to pull them up." "Public apology and fined £60." I says, "I'm not making a public apology." "You'll make a public apology. I'm telling you, you'll make a pu..." I says, "You can fine me all you want, but I'm not fucking making a public apology, not for sitting on a ball." He certainly let the players know, what their job was. And in John Greig he had a player who would take his instructions down to the letter. FUNK MUSIC Well, John Greig was an example to everybody, and I think he was the alter-ego for Willie Waddell on the field, commanding people. He commanded them off the pitch. John Greig commanded them on the pitch. [commentator] Greig shoots, it's a goal! He was simply a captain with a personal drive that I think you could associate with Waddell as a player. Almost a mirror image of each other. And John inspired the rest of the players. You were fortunate in having John Greig, the greatest ever Rangers player he was voted as well, of course. John Greig to me was important in every game. You wanted John Greig on the park. He was a tremendous asset to us. He was a tremendous leader. I think Greigy got on alright with Waddell. I think they had a lot of respect. I always looked up to him as a famous player from this club. And he sat me in his office through there, and he said to me, "we're going to bring this club back up to where it should be." He could see in me probably a lot of him as a younger person, to move the club in the direction it should go. They worked well together, they did. They were a good manager, and captain. But then you have boys like me on the team that's gonna talk and say, "Well, I didn't agree with this." You get that in every team. FOREBODING MUSIC The day was the second of January. It was a dull, dark, grey, misty day. The fixture was Rangers and Celtic. That's was always the biggest game basically on the calendar, the league calendar. CROWD CHEERS The game itself was quite a dull Old Firm game. And the two goals were scored in the last minute of the game. Celtic scored first. Colin Stein... he scored the equaliser. After the game finished, we moved our way up the terracing. And when you get to the top of the terracing, there's a concourse And they were shuffling along... the concourse. It was really tight, the crowd was about 80,000. My Father always installed in me when you're... in big crowds going out the games, you keep your arms up. Don't let your arms get pinned at your side. This is basically where the exit would have been, coming out from the steps and the slopes of passageway 13. And we were basically up here. We turned right, you go down the stairs, and it was very, very tight. And somebody had fallen halfway down the stairs. And... it was like a pack of cards. [witness] The scene was terrible it was like a picture from... the last war. The bodies were just all over the place. Everybody was starting to pile up on top of each other, just constant pressure. Everybody was shouting, "Get back! Get back!" Because you know, you just had to do something. And end up...you couldnae even shout, "get back, get back" because the air was getting squeezed out your lungs, and you were gasping for breath. The more you moved, the more you would just fall The more you moved, the more you would just fall and you were getting crushed like mad. And I could- couldnae breathe at all. And there was another fella, just across from me, shouted, "I'm dying" Then I saw him fall. I prayed to God, and said "please don't let me die." There was a bit of give in front of me. And I managed to pull myself up, crawl over everybody, and I fell over onto the grass embankment. My breathing was gone and my shoes went off, lost my watch. But I eventually made it down to the bottom of the bankment, and the disaster was just happening in front of me. It was that kind of spectral mist about the place. Imagine seeing a whole line of bodies, some of the faces blackened. I... I had nightmares about it for weeks after. We didn't realize what exactly the disaster, how bad it was. So I was in the dressing room, everybody was dressed and away, Then Willie Waddell came in and went, "you, you and you, out now." This guy came in with a stretcher, with a body on it, and he said, "you better hurry up, John." He says "because there's been a big accident. They're going to be using the dressing room here for bodies." It was like Dunkirk with all the bodies laying all along the side of the pitch. Everybody was devastated, you know, when that happened. It took us a long time to go over that, to be perfectly honest it... I mean, I was only a kid as well. I mean, I'm 16, 17 years of age when that happened. Reported by that time, the official death rate of 66. The Rangers directors were in a state of shock. And then...Willie Waddell walked in, and he took over, he took command. And from then on he was in charge of everything that happened in the aftermath. The organizing of visits to relatives, of funerals, totally in charge. That's when Willie Waddell come into his own, because he orchestrated the whole situation. Waddell made sure that we went to as many funerals as we could. Players would go and meet the families of not only people who perished, but also people... who survived. It's something I've never forgotten, the Ibrox Disaster, and anybody that was involved is probably feeling the same way. They'll never forget it. You've got somebody in your family going to a football match and they don't come back. And a lot of them were young people. There's no way you can make up for a tragedy like that, but you can certainly make things worse. His priority is about making sure that never happens again. He did take it. By the scruff of the neck and... and he rebuilt the stadium. Everything. He went out and he looked at stadiums across the world to change Ibrox. I mean it's-it's... Willie Waddell's legacy. Willie Waddell always maintained that the new stadium was a testimony to the people that died. So as it would never, ever happen again. Least he can do for the people who died that day is to rebuild Ibrox itself. And he knows that in the short term he has to... he has to get some sort of glory on the field. It's strange to say, but it seemed to bond everybody. You know that comradery, and that friendship, and that you know, we are the Rangers and the fans are a huge part of that for us and we came away from that saying, "you know what we've, we've got to give these fans something back." The manager got us all together and said "look let's do for these poor people, these people that came to watch football and never went home, only thing we can do is go out there and try and perform and win things. That's all this club can do for these poor people that perished." Every Rangers player knew what was in store for them now. Revival. Revival and survival. and what better way to do it than winning things. UPLIFTING ORCHESTRAL MUSIC When the manager came in, and just- and he was wonderful, just the way he said it was great. "We owe them. Big time! So let's get the heads down and work hard and win games and win trophies." Team spirit, you know, it was it was getting better. Better, better, you know, much more... together. The Rangers fans are looking for Rangers to win a European trophy. And of course, that's where the great opportunity came along. JAZZ ORCHESTRA MUSIC Well European football was about prestige. The Rangers community wanted part of it, we wanted to rub shoulders with the best. They wanted into Europe if they got a European prize, that in itself elevated Rangers into a different stratosphere, if you like. At that time in the seventies, there were three European trophies up for grabs. Rangers qualified for the European Cup Winners| Cup. The Cup Winners' Cup had massive value because if you look at the people who won the Cup in the top countries, they were the top teams. Rangers qualified as runners up. So it was by default, effectively, that Rangers found themselves, catapulted into the European arena. And my goodness, they grabbed their chance. BLUES ROCK MUSIC Willie built a good team, so it was well balanced team, with a lot of good... we had everything in the right place. John Greig, number four, captain. Peter McCloy, goalkeeper. Derek Johnstone, number five, striker, midfield, and defense. Bill Mathieson, left-back, number three. Dave Smith, number six, midefield, sweeper. Alex McDonald, left midfield. Colin Stein, number nine, striker. Willie Johnston, outside-left, number 11. To pick out, one, two, three from that team is just, it's impossible. It was a collective. FUNK ROCK MUSIC The very first game we had drawn in France against Stade Rennes, which we obviously thought was gonna be a good draw. But we hadnae started the season very well. We were outsiders, total outsiders. You wouldnae put a bet on us in the first game. Well, everyone knows the flair of French football. Rangers were perhaps a wee bit fragile, defensively. I think Willie Waddell and Jock Wallace was still striving to come up with the best combination, particularly at the heart of the defense. So Rangers had to find a formula that stopped this French flair So Rangers had to find a formula that stopped this French flair and they did it by the high press. They would look for their star man, and try and minimise his impact within the rules... or sometimes outside the rules. It wasn't a spectacle from a fan's perspective. But my goodness, it was effective. Marcell Aubour I think was the goalkeeper, Keruzoré and Betta were their kind of playmakers in midfield. And it was Willie Waddell's tactics And it was Willie Waddell's tactics He put John Greig and Alex McDonald onto these guys He put John Greig and Alex McDonald onto these guys and they did not appreciate it. We knew exactly what we were up against There are a few PC players in the side that could cause us real problems. You know, if we weren't marking. CROWD NOISE Tactically I think we were sound Rennes were a bit upset how we... we performed and that, I don't know I don't know if they were taken aback, the way we... we played a bit physical. The French are nae very brave at the best of times are they? Rennes weren't happy at all by the way Rangers played in that game, you know. One of the reporters said the Rangers forgot what the ball was for. Yeah. He's probably talking about me. [chuckles] Yeah he's definitely talking about me. In fact, I think they put... one of the French journalists had said "if this Rangers team had been in the... front line of the war it'd have finished earlier." You're not going to stand back and let a good team play, you got to shut them down. They don't play, we play. Well, the thing is, what's anti-football? You've come to win a game. That's when I came in at the near post, It went whizzing past me Willie Johnston put it in. You're there to try and get a result. Everybody wants to watch lovely football, but we went there with most men behind the ball and their manager felt, "well, they're not even trying to win. You know, that's non-football." 'Anti-football.' It's 'anti-football.' Well, I beg your pardon but we've come away with a 1-1 draw. Let's see how you do at Ibrox. CROWD NOISES UPBEAT FUNK MUSIC After the game their manager stated in the press that "when we come to Glasgow we'll show them how to play football." Didn't matter what he said! That was fine, just let them talk. We'll do our talking on the pitch. That's what we said. Then in the second leg we did the business. They went back with their tails between their legs. Some times you don't have to play nice football. We won. That's not anti-football, that's just scoring a goal. I'll settle for that, every time I'm not bothered. It don't matter what they say about you. I've been called a lot of things. Little Willie Johnston, an icon. He didn't want to be peripheral to the game He didn't want to be peripheral to the game by playing as a winger. He wanted to be the second striker, and in Rennes that was probably the first time that Rangers deployed him in that area of the team. Because they knew they had to be stuffy, they had to be durable and they had to defend from the front. So Willie Johnston was played up top alongside Colin Stein. And my goodness, that partnership was forged. ROCK MUSIC The quickest player I've ever seen here at Ibrox. He was that quick, he could catch pigeons. I always remember the Rennes game, the crowd reacting to Willie Johnston's pace, [surprised noise] who's that? He had this... built in temper. Colin Stein makes this comment about Willie Johnston, I don't know if it's true. He's the best player he ever played with from the neck down. He was sent off 22 times in his career. Which is...phenomenal. And he says to me, he says "I played 22 years." So he said "it was only once a year." He was just a typical Fifer, you know, He'd his own brand of laughter and good stories, wee Willie Johnston. Well, well, how are you doing? How are you doing, Willie? Great to see you again. He played Ayr United one day, and he was going to take a corner kick and a guy held this can of lager and said, "you want a drink, buddy?" He says "yeah" and he took a drink. Give it him back, and took the corner. Think you might a yellow card for these type of things nowadays. That's Willie... no, but a good lad. Did you score one goal? Dos. Was it not Steiny that got two, no? He got one. Did you get two? [laughs] I wanted to become a footballer. So... it was either the army or the pit and a lot my friends went to the pit. So I just went with them so I could play football. on a Saturday afternoon. I was asked to sign for Man United but It'd been the first time I'd been away from home and I was homesick. I was in a hotel and it was terrible and I came home, and I was asked to sign for Rangers. My Father, he wanted me to sign for Man United, he liked Rangers, he liked... but he always said to me... "you're a man now so never come back and tell me you made a mistake." Worked out alright. Lisbon? Well, it really was drama of the highest order. SWING MUSIC Lisbon was, you know, a big name, a big team... still is. And that was always going to be the difficult one. That was a test. Sporting were one of the favorites. They were the favorite, one of the favorites to win that trophy. You look through the team that they had really, really established international players who were always going to pose problems. I think the problems that they posed were probably unexpected because it was... more fierce and more more formidable than maybe even Waddell had anticipated. One thing that added spice to the game was that Sporting Lisbon, they wore Celtic strips. they wore Celtic tops, you know, so when they ran out at Ibrox they wore Celtic tops, you know, so when they ran out at Ibrox that night, there was a little bit of extra... tension there, if you like. We were playing great. We got off to a flyer. They were miles ahead by halftime. Steiny scored two, wee Willie scored one. We were winning three-nothing at halftime. We were all over them. The thought was this tie is done. The thought was this tie is done. They brought this guy on the left wing... and he ran riot. We lost a goal, 3-1. And then they got that, and they come right into it then. they lost one goal, then they lost a... a goal very close to the end to make it a very nervy finish. I probably should not have lost two goals. You know, I can't remember if I was playing at the back or in midfield... I was possibly playing at the back so it's probably my fault. 3-2 at home's not really a good result to go to the second game away. If they can score two goals here what can they do at home? UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC The first leg, it was by no means... done and it was about going out to Lisbon to- to really finish off what had been started. And the journey to the second game was incredible. Anything that could have gone wrong went wrong. You couldn't make it up. Chaos is the only way to describe it. Well normally you've got to be in the opposing team's city by 24 hours, prior to kick off or you forfeited the game. We're on British Airways, on the way to London and the captain come on, he says: "there's a- a strike in London. The baggage handlers have gone on strike and you'll have to get your own stuff from the hold." And as soon as we arrived in London, we we're told "all flights have been cancelled." So there's no flight to Portugal. Where they actually had to carry their own bags... to their hotel in London, they were forced to stay in overnight. hotel in London, they were forced to stay in overnight. They announced a flight for us, This was about 12:00, at this time you'd to be in Portugal by I think it was 5:00, It's an old Vi-Viscount and twin-turbo. It's a little propeller thing and as soon as the engine started up, the smoke was filling in the cabin like We're never gonna get there [laughs] We landed with about half an hour to spare. As a kind of sign of things to come. The game itself was erm... 'chaos' was the best way to describe it. Bonkers. Absolute bonkers. SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC At Lisbon... ah it was... There was a lot of noise that night, y'know DRUM MUSIC It was a great atmosphere. Just like Ibrox, they had drums along the line and that they were bang bang banging The crowd were... the atmosphere was incredible. The home side opened the scoring They scored... when they- There was only one way for this to go, we had to go forward. Cancelled out within 60 seconds By Colin Stein... to be short lived. Sporting got another goal just before halftime and again the tie has swung against Rangers, Sporting are in the lead. But again Rangers dug deep and right after halftime, Colin Stein on target yet again. They were putting the ball in the net and I was going up and putting the ball in their net. It was horrendous. Up and down. I think the biggest... bang was when the boy broke Ronnie's leg. You could hear it, the crack. Ronnie received one of the most diabolical tackles I'd ever seen in my life. Yazalde went over the top, got him right in the shin. Everybody put their hands to their head because they knew exactly what happened. And we're running about "Get up you!" Shouting at him, "Get up!" And Ronnie's just... like that, "I think I broke my leg." Ankle's lying like that and his knee's still there. He never even got booked, Yazalde, for this. So we're sitting there and only defenders on the bench was Davie Smith and I, it's the first time I'm sayin' "I hope it's not me that's going on." I could feel the sweat running down the back of my shirt. Davie Smith, who was a sweeper, he come on, and he was just back for a broken leg. You know he was... ashen when he seen Ronnie. Teams are tied, level, over the piece, we're going into extra time. Wee Willie Henderson, as he did in the first leg, he puts... Wee Willie Henderson, as he did in the first leg, he puts... he scores for Rangers 10 minutes into extra time. And then they got a penalty kick just at the end and it was 4-3. It means the tie ends, 6-6. And... the referee decides it's going to go to penalties. That year I think was the first change in the away goals rule. Away goals counted double, in Europe. The referee didn't understand it He thought that the away goals rule was only for the 90 minutes So we went to penalties. Now, half the Rangers team know about the change to away goals rule... and half of them don't. We just thought we'd won the game. We were coming off the park, congratulating one another that we're through. And the referee's turned "what's going on here? Penalty kicks." We're still arguing with the referee that we're through. So I don't think we were... we were 100%, you know, concentrating on the penalties, which isn't an excuse really. Davie Smith's was the best [laughs]. The goalkeeper was moving, so I ran up and I stopped, and the goalkeeper dived. And I sort of smile, and I put it passed the post. He ran up, swaggerin' and that, He ran up, swaggerin' and that, and he went like *boof , right passed the post. But... the referee says "you'll have to take it again." run up, stopped, goalkeeper dived. Passed the post again. Twice. It must be, you know, the only player to... to miss twice in a European shootout I would've thought. We missed all our penalties [laughs]. It was one of those nights when 20, 30 shots... naebody hits the target. And we just think they've been eliminated because they failed at the penalty shootout. Sporting Lisbon, celebrating, thinking they've made it to the quarterfinals. They were carrying their goalkeeper round their shoulders and their fans. And we're going... flummoxed by what's happened. So as far as we were concerned we were out. We're all... heads down, cause we were... disgusted with ourselves. They go into the dressing room, despondent, defeated, out of the tournament. Waddell's commiserating with us all like, you know. And Willie Henderson, another terrific player in that squad, he said, "I think the rules are: the away goals scored in extra time do count as double. We should be through." On this occasion, they had to thank journalism. On this occasion, they had to thank journalism. John Fairgrieve, who was a reporter in the Scottish game at the time, was aware that something wasn't right. ENERGETIC ROCK MUSIC That journalist came through, kind of brandishing the rulebook The rules said Rangers had won, so he went and alerted Willie Waddell to that fact. He burst into the dressing room with this wee book, he says, "You shouldn't have gone to penalties." He says, "You won the game in extra time!" I didn't at that point, still didn't believe him I don't think He said, "I'm telling ya Willie!" The referee had made a monumental blunder. He still didn't know what was happening. The referee made a few phone calls and lo and behold, "Yeah you were right, I beg your pardon, Rangers are through the next round." The euphoria when we found out five minutes, ten minutes later that we were back in. From down there to up there, it was tremendous like. All of a sudden, on my birthday, we're in the next round of the European Cup Winners' Cup Absolutely... phenomenal! You find out you're back in the hat again so you're getting another chance. Hopefully this time we don't play as bad. There was a thing then where you think "Well... you never know, maybe we could win this." It was a shock for a lot of Rangers fans when they woke up the next morning and seen the papers. When you scored the goals you're always going to get the headlines, you know, and he loved the headlines, Steiny. he scored on the Saturday, on the Sunday he'd buy every Sunday paper to see his name in lights there. He loved scoring goals, and he proved it in Portugal when he was there. When it had to be done, to qualify we needed to score goals and he was the man that, once again, came up trumps. And Colin Stein's verve, his appetite for the game. and his willing to do the hard yards and constant running for the team was never more evident than the night in Lisbon. I didnae start bowling 'til about 1978 when I stopped playing football. I like to win [laughs] I like to win. An enigma. I never knew anybody with as much energy as he had, and he never stopped talking. Colin Stein, Louis the Lip. [laughs] We used to call him the Louisville Lip, after Muhammad Ali. You know, Muhammad Ali could yap all the time. Steiny was the same. Biggest pest I've ever met. Honestly, I would have hated to play against that guy. You... he must have talked you off your game. Every time I see him he gets beat. But no... he loves the bowls. Likes a glass of red wine also. It's a great game. You know, it brings everybody. you can be a terrible bowler, you can be great... everybody cannae be a champion. But the camaraderie in the bowling club is, you know, second to none. Just the, you know, the football with your teammates, and that. I got them for playing obviously Ireland, England and Wales. I didnae get a cap each, the same cap. You know Steiny was great, he was one of these footballers he was one of these footballers That can actually hang in the air for a couple of seconds. It felt he was there for about 30 seconds in the air. It felt he was there for about 30 seconds in the air. Tell you what, he was like an old fashioned center forward. He could score goals and he could rough it with the best of them. He didn't get messed about. He was two footed, he was good in the air. He was a good player Colin, he was a really good player. Colin Stein joined Rangers, the first £100,000 transfer Colin Stein joined Rangers, the first £100,000 transfer between two Scottish clubs, from Hibernian. He was just 21 years of age. The support at Rangers was absolute fantastic. I was lucky enough to score a hat trick in my first game. Against Arbroath and that got the, you know, the crowd on my side. He was a tremendous player, Rangers fanatic you know but can he talk you know. A likeable pest. [laughs] A likeable pest and a great friend. We moved on to the next game, which is... Torino. ROCK MUSIC Italy was where it was at, wasn't it? I mean, they were the poster boys of world football. I mean, they were the poster boys of world football. Well, Torino were the top team in Italy then. They were a typical Italian team defensively. They were a typical Italian team defensively. It was all about the physicality in the Scottish game. And there was these suave Italians And there was these suave Italians who could all pass the ball with distinction. And they were known for a modern approach to the game. We were very good side, and when we played them, they were top of the league. They were a serious side, amazingly difficult to beat. LOUNGE MUSIC Coaching was evolving, and Willie Waddell was really at the heart of that from a Scottish perspective. He was learning he had Jock Wallace beside him. Who was a similar character, wanted to learn Who was a similar character, wanted to learn and wanted evolve, and he took the team just to a different level to compete with these teams. Waddell and big Jock, yeah they done their homework Every game he set out himself to go and watch these teams and come back with this dossier on each player and everything. It's a great example of how football has changed, when the managers got to give pen picks to the players to see what his opposition looks like. Nowadays, of course, they know them inside out, upside down. But that time, they didn't know what they looked like. Hadn't seen them play on television and wouldn't have known them unless you had played against them previously. And that was, that was breakthrough stuff, at that point, you know. Here everybody's got their own card, player, date of birth, 'many kids he's got, you know. Not said I'm not gonna kick him because he's got two kids, you know what I mean. [laughs] There was myself, Alex MacDonald, and Sandy and we... were set out as markers. Our role was stay with the player. Wherever the player went, you went. You have to change it in football you have to have different styles depending on which team you're playing against. We seem to adapt, you know, when we played away in Europe we played a different system, we played with a sweeper, which was hardly heard of then. The sweeper was designed by the Italians. A football playing defender, made use of the ball and tried to spring counter-attacks and they would immediately try and get the attack going, from defense. Dave Smith embraced that part of the game, like an Italian would. I liked having the ball. At the back... I did get plenty of the ball. He's the best sweeper I have ever seen. Absolutely wonderful left foot. I think he did settle the back four, that's for sure. He was the, the sweeper in the side, and we never lost too many goals after that. BAGPIPES MUSIC There's been a bus going from Fraserburgh for years and I believe one of the main members, Dave Hamilton, he played five or six-aside games of football with him in Aberdeen. And I believe that's how people from Fraserburgh got to know him he started to come on the bus, and the bus just got named after him: The Dave Smith Loyal Fraserburgh. # We are the champions # # We are the champions # # No time for CELTIC! # My Granddad.... every old guy speaks about him says how class a player he was, just... just a touch of class. He wasn't fast or anything but he didn't need to be, Cause he had it up there they say... Dave? Oh Dave was a class player. Very class, classy left foot. Smithy? Quiet, didnae shout a lot on the park, didnae talk a lot on the park. When he got the ball... Unbelievable. Cool, calm, collected. Oh dear. You been waitin' long? Yes... [conversation fades] Mr quiet man. Thinks he's funny, but he's never funny. He laughs at his own jokes. To me he was another Beckenbauer. So cool, calm, and collective you know... You don't appreciate at the time, just how really good he was. Oh! Hold on a second, I'll have to go and check something. [crew] Petrol or diesel? I think it's diesel... Oh aye, so it is. MUSIC: "The Best Team in the Land" by Glasgow Rangers Support # We've got the best team in the land. # # We've got Dave Smith, number six # # We've got Dave Smith, number six # # We've got Dave Smith, number six # # We've got the best team in the land. # # We've got the best team in the land. # ETHEREAL MUSIC My brother who died at 26, he was a Rangers supporter, and I always said I would, I would play for Rangers. Well he died before I did, but... I kept true to that. I met Scot Symon, and he said "we'll look after you." And he was good as his word, you know. That was it, that was me. Well, I kind of realised pretty early on is, you don't choose it, it chooses you and I think that's a really intriguing thing about the top top players a really intriguing thing about the top top players don't really realise what they've got within them. I watch clips of my Dad playing in front of, you know, I watch clips of my Dad playing in front of, you know, crowds of 70,000. You look at Willie Johnston sitting on the ball and, you know, the heat of battle and all that sort of stuff. They didn't think anything of it that was that was where they were at home. We would, go to games together and you would get people it would be you know "Davey you got your boots today, you playin'?" joking, you know, and he would laugh and he would smile and he would say, "Yeah, yeah." But actually deep down I think he thought, yeah, yeah, I could still, I could still be out there. It's really difficult to let go, I think, because you still feel you could be out there. You still feel you could do a job. I like to see the team win. How you win that matters a lot to me. Dave Smith on the night against Torino, out-Italianed the Italians. He did the Italian job. No, I didn't play in Torino either. Ahh, well I did play in Torino. Ah, well you see, you know more than I do because... I cannae remember playing against Torino. [laughs] The only thing I can remember about Torino is just coming home, and going shopping. We bought tartan bonnets. I've got one upstairs, I just found it the other day, the tartan bonnet, we all bought that, and we were walking through the square, five of us, with tartan bonnets on. That was... probably one of the That was... probably one of the the best talks we'd had before anything, was Waddell sitting us down, and getting us to realise the importance of this game. This game, could be the springboard to win a European trophy. Realise what you's could achieve here, you could make history. Willie Waddell, giving out the pen pics of the various players. And he tells John Greig that this is Claudio Sala. And he tells John Greig that this is Claudio Sala. The legend is, that Willie Waddell just kind of used the phrase "put him out of the game." If you make sure that he doesn't play, then they lack their best playmaker. And I had the reputation for being somebody that liked to make a tackle. I'd say to him, I says "do you mean, just for tonight Boss, or for good?" He says "oh no" no I says, "no I'm sorry" I says "that's the wrong thing to say." I think the way that John Greig stared at the pen pic, he was given, actually scared Willie Waddell. he was given, actually scared Willie Waddell. Look after Sala. [commentator] Sala with the ball at his feet and Greig trying to dispossess... a foul. Sala. It does John Greig a massive disservice It does John Greig a massive disservice to paint him as merely as a hatchet man. He's a hell of a player, scored a lot of vital goals as well, but he knows what he's got to do and he does sort Sala out early doors. [commentator] Freekick awarded to Torino. Sala. A swarm of Rangers' players there. Greig is being warned by the Referee. Sala can't move in there, although it was to be expected. They weren't happy, you know, maybe that slowed them down. That got them thinking, "We're playing against a team here, that know how to play the game." You know, physically. INTENSE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC [commentator] Torino are certainly being given a game. They almost look caught out! Especially when Rangers advance up the pitch. All against the run of play, Rangers open the scoring. I ran the length of the park, had a shot. The goalkeeper did a brilliant save, knocked the ball down, and Willie Johnston walked in and tapped it into the net. Willie Johnston again with that blistering pace. Chances were few and far between But Rangers knew that they would be given limited opportunities to score, against this well-drilled Italian rear-guard action. And it took a pretty scrappy equaliser to get the Italians back on level terms. Colin Jackson clears the ball off the line and then Toschi fires it straight back in, and Paolo Pulici, who is their kind of top striker, he gets a deflection on it and that takes it away from, from Peter McCloy but... that's the only reason we've conceded and Willie Waddell was absolutely delighted with the performance. He, kind of, runs onto the park at the end, kind of... he was really delighted. MATCH WHISTLE [commentator] And that's the final whistle. Willie Waddell is straight on the pitch to congratulate his players. The Torino manager, Gustavo Giagnoni, talks about how Rangers played the Italian game, and he's very, very complementary. And at that time, to get, a kind of, away goals advantage, in Italy is an incredible result. [commentator] 1-1 against the top Italian side, is surely a result that will send the Rangers supporters is surely a result that will send the Rangers supporters home beaming tonight. A fantastic result. We got the result we were looking for, and went home there delighted and at once again thinking at one each, what a chance we've got at Ibrox again to get through to the next round. 70'S ROCK MUSIC We went back and we beat them in Glasgow. We went back and we beat them in Glasgow. The second game, the center half always with him, and I was The second game, the center half always with him, and I was running down with the ball and that, and he f*ckin' whacked me right there, with hand like that, they were physical as well. They could look after theirselves. It was a hard, hard game... Turin, physically, and you know, tactically as well. I think this was the time where, because of the quarter final, because of the opponents, when they played Torino, I think with the Rangers crowd kind of felt that real momentum, a bit of magic was starting to build up at this point. Rangers again had pulled the rabbit out the hat. They'd turned it into an art form. So we're in the semifinals, we can't believe we're in the semifinals. We've done so well, the confidence is, is high in all the players, and you can see that in the training and everything else. The draw was being made, I always remember, in the afternoon, we were saying "Hope-hopefully we don't get Bayern Munich" because they were the best side, you know, in the last ten years. INTENSE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC Bayern were a marvelous team. They were actually the best team in the world. Eventually they were going to mop up everything in sight, both domestically and in Europe itself. They'd seven players that played for the German national side. They'd seven players that played for the German national side. Names just tripping off your tongue. You know the Gerd Müllers. The Maiers, the Breitners. Overath. Guy called Zobel. Franz Roth. Franz Beckenbauer. Franz Beckenbauer. Beckenbauer. Beckenbauer. Beckenbauer. Beckenbauer. The greatest captain that Germany's ever had. What a player he was. They had an aura about them didn't they? West Germany, they're always big, physical teams. West Germany, they're always big, physical teams. They were the favorites to win it. And that is why when the draw took place, I didn't really fancy Rangers. I thought they've reached their peak now. They've done as much as they possibly can do. So when I went to, to Bayern, I went with a degree of trepidation. The, the Bayern final in '67 it burnt deeply, you know and those that played in it but the supporters as well. It was as if this pair were destined to meet every time they took to the European stage. And Rangers lost the European Cup Winners' Cup of 1967 to Bayern Munich. We played them in Nuremberg, in the final, which was basically a home game from them, for them being, being a German side. Willie Johnston, John Greig. Dave Smith and Sandy Jardine. Who'd all played in that final of 1967. I think they were a better team. We lost, one-nothing and we gave a good account of ourselves and I thought, to be honest I think we were a little bit unlucky. MUSIC INTENSIFIES They'd gone through the pain and knowing what it felt like to come off that pitch and they actually had to, to line up and applaud as Bayern, you know, picked up that cup. Had they learned from that previous experience? could they take on Bayern Munich? Were they overdue a result against Bayern Munich? Redemption. CHEERING One of the things about playing at this club I felt I could beat anybody, never always happened, but always felt that I could beat any, any team because we were the Rangers. TENSE MUSIC For the first 30 minutes of the first leg in West Germany, Rangers were under the cosh. It was the most pressure they'd been under in any game during the competition. The first half we just couldn't get out of our own box. We were actually... backs against the wall. It really was. Every one of their players, except Sepp Maier, the goalkeeper, had a shot at our goal. They were so dominant against us And the goal that Bayern score, Paul Breitner basically playing one-two with Gerd Müller, who manages for once to get inside Colin Jackson. CROWD NOISES It was a backs to the wall performance. The Germans tried everything they had, but that night every Rangers player really gave all they had. None more so than Billy Mathieson. I got a marker's job to mark Roth. This lad couldn't get away from me like, You know, he was all over the park. Willie Mathieson was up and down the wing, some machine. I had to man mark a man called Uli Hoeneß, he was the midfield maestro. Willie Waddell said to me, "Your job tonight, never mind anybody else, he's your man, mark him!" He says "at halftime if he goes to the toilet for a wee wee, you stand outside the door and look after 'im." Big Jock says "you just go with him, follow him wherever he goes. And when Beckenbauer comes over the halfway line go to Beckenbauer." Are you talkin' to me? Beckenbauer's about six foot four. If he told you to do it, you do it. By the second half, Franz Beckenbauer strolls forward and tries one of his contemptuous little flicks. And Alex MacDonald just cuts it out and Colin Stein takes the ball, still in the Bayern half. And what him and Willie Johnston, who had played so well together as a unit, they turn them inside out. Schwarzenbeck has fallen over the top of Sepp Maier, and the ball that... Colin Stein plays back in Rainer Zobel heads it, you know, into his own net. And Willie Johnston goes down and congratulates him. Rainer Zobel just... he buries his face in the mud. It was an own goal but listen we'll take it. When you're in Germany playing against mighty Bayern Munich, if you'd scored with your backside you'd have taken it, it's as simple as that. In the second half we defended well never, never gave Gerd Müller a sniff. And at the end of the game they were, they were outrunning the Bayern Munich side you know, they were much superior in terms of fitness. In fact Willie Johnston was through in the last minute when the Referee blew the whistle for full-time. So you never know it could have been another one, at that particular time. We survived over there, big time! It was the first time then, in my career, that I'd seen all 11 players, when that referee blew the whistle, actually punching the air and jumpin' about. ENERGETIC JAZZ MUSIC Big Jock and Willie Waddell, first time I've seen the two of them smiling at the one time, you know, these two had confidence in us that we could go all the way and maybe even pick up this trophy. But Wallace was a fitness fanatic and all the players will tell you that made the difference. Big Jock, was, oh... Sergeant Major. I would run through a brick wall for Jock Wallace, without a shadow of a doubt. He was that type of person. He was a Marine. And you could see that in the way he spoke, in the way he did the training, and everything else. He's a winner. Always will be a winner. He was a character, a real character, hard as nails. You never argued with Jock, he'd just hit you. He would give you a kick up the backside when you needed it. He put his arm around you and give you a cuddle when you needed it. He was like a father figure to me. He looked on us all as his lads. You know, "You're my boys. I'm going to look after you." If You're not doing something right, I'm gonna tell you." And boy, did he tell us. This is the day that they have to tackle this. The hill. JAZZ MUSIC Jock Wallace and Murder Hill was synonymous with that period. East coast beach... and run until you drop. We had to do these sand dunes for about an hour. Well I've never in my life experienced anything like it. Really it was punishing, but it made us. [Jock Wallace] Hands off that bloody sand, come on! Had about a session for an hour, that was all. And during that hour you weren't allowed to walk. I remember Jock running over to me and lifting me up by the scruff of the neck. He says, "hey Son, if you're going to be sick, be sick running, keep running!" As much as it was physical, it was psychological, they believed they were fitter than, than anyone else. We just felt as if we could, we could run through brick walls. It was extreme training but my God did it work. The expectation levels at Ibrox for the, for the, semifinal were kind of, off the scale. It was a great night for Glasgow football, Scottish football Two games, either end of the city, staggered by half an hour. 150,000 there. Never be repeated again. Rangers... under the shadow of what happened in 1967, are facing Bayern, the team who defeated them in that final, and Celtic are, are facing Inter, the team that they beaten... in that final so there's a kind of a poetry there. And I had got this terrible shin injury, and it was touch and go, whether I played against Bayern Munich. I would not like to have played brag against Willie Waddell. He came up with one or two distractions involving the media. The wily old Fox. He says, "John you get on that table there." And he says, "pull your socks down." So I did. And he brought all the press core in. He said, "Have a look at that." And my shin bone... it was practically showing the bone. And the... the guy says, "he's not playing with that?!" He say's, "yeah he's playing." he says "that just shows you, he's not frightened about Bayern Munich." He says, "He's playing" "Right, on you go." And out they go [laughs] He was really struggling, but they didn't want to make it public. It was about maintaining a guessing game, It was about maintaining a guessing game, and it left the Rangers fans bewildered, it left the German team totally in the dark as to what to expect. As it was, John Greig was never really going to make the game. Dave Smith captained the side. Dave Smith captained the side. And Derek Parlane, almost unheard of, was thown in to the starting 11 against the giants of the German game. My dad said to me, "Derek, do you think there's a chance that you might be on the bench?" And I said, "Dad... on the bench would be beyond my wildest dreams." Jock Wallace came into the dressing room before the game. He says, "Right lads, here's tonight's team: number one Peter McCloy, number two Sandy Jardine, number three, Billy Mathieson, number four Derek Parlane, number five, six..." I honestly did not hear the rest of the team. Jock says to me, "Derek, come on Son, I want a word with you in the boot room." [laughs] I nearly said, "Jock, I want a word wi' you, what you doin'?" He said to me, "Look, we've watched you lately in training, we've watched the two games you played for us. we've watched the two games you played for us. We want you to mark a guy." This guy was called Franz Roth. "And if you get half a chance..." kick the big bastard!" INTENSE VIOLIN MUSIC They flew in the day of the game, They think, "We'll go there, we'll play the game, and we're back home at midnight, and we're in the final." I think they were so confident, and Big Jock says, "Yeah, typical Germans you know, just how they are. They just think they're going to win every game. Especially this mob because, they're a great side." He says, "We're going to have to play, everybody's gonna have to play out their skin tonight. If we don't, then we've no chance. And if we can score a goal, what a start that'll be for us. There's 80,000 here at Ibrox. So of course we'll go out, we can't believe it, the noise is phenomenal, we're all lined up just looking around. They could sense that something was going to happen as well, and so did we. MATCH WHISTLE INTENSE CLASSICAL MUSIC My goodness Rangers started with a whirlwind: tempo, desire. Move the ball quickly. I gave the ball to Sany Jardine, just on the halfway line. The man who had suffered such frustration against Bayern Munich in the previous final of 1967, cuts in from the right wing. His left foot was just for walking with, he'd never kicked a ball with his left foot in his life. and all of a sudden he goes back and all the lads are shouting, "NO DON'T SHOOT, PASS!" VICTORIOUS JAZZ MUSIC He's hit this ball wi' his left foot and it's gone straight in the top corner. What a goal it is! And Sandy couldn't believe himself. The ball's in the back of the net within the first minute. and 80,000... the roar when you hear it is, it's quite, it's quite something else. God love you Sandy, scored in the first minute of the game. It settled us right down. We're all over them! Willie Johnston is running the fullback right, he's firing balls across the goal. You know we're just missing the headers. And, I hadn't even had a kick at the big German sod so far, but I got a few digs in, and then in the 21st minute Willie Johnston hit a corner over from the, the left hand side from the Broomloan road end, and Sepp Maier, the goalie, punched it out. And I met it on the half volley with my left foot, which was usually for standing on, and it went up into the postage stamp. And... ah my God, the guys couldn't catch me, I ran that fast. And that night, that goal, my life changed. Sounds very dramatic but it did. My life changed. DRAMATIC MUSIC It's... arguably the greatest performance in the whole, in the whole run. And that is essentially Bayern Munich done after 20 odd minutes Franz Beckenbauer was something special, you know, really world class, but I had him on toast at Ibrox. Rangers basically are left, they were toying... at one point in the second half Willie Johnston actually, he just sits on the ball. Briefly, but he sits on the ball just to make the point that Rangers are tearing apart what would basically be the greatest team in the world for the next three or four years. Willie Waddell gave him stick about it, he says, oh he says, "I was tired." I was getting tired... so I had to take a wee rest. Sepp Maier I think it was, He lost the plot, the crowd got the better of him. and I think he... dropped his drawers and that to the crowd and things like that, so he was upset. They were arguing with each other. We knew then that we werenae gonna lose, you know. Just another game aye, another game to win, which we did. It was probably one of the greatest games in Glasgow's football history. It will never happen again, I don't think. Celtic lost their game that night and went out. and we went on, you know, which made it even better for us like, you know. My Dad, my Dad picked me up after the game. I popped into my Dad's car and we drove home. My Mum says, "Well done Derek, you did well tonight. You want a cup of tea?" I had a cup of tea and went to bed. We'd beat one of the best teams in the world. FUNK MUSIC The final in Barcelona. As soon as you get to the airport, there was Rangers fans there already waiting on us. The amount of people that were there were phenomenal, just ordinary supporters that couldn't really afford to get there. But, they made it. And in' early 70's, working class people didn't go abroad for their holidays, that was preserved for the middle classes. The 25,000 or so Rangers fans who went, most of them would be going on a plane for the first time. Most of them had to go into debt. A lot of the boys were going to Barcelona on a provvy cheque. It's a loan! And that was a big thing, You know, credit wasn't easy to get in those days. It wasnae even acceptable. Rangers fans had got there any which way they could. They'd gone by car, hitching lifts. they'd hired buses. Bicycle, scooters, motorbikes, vans. Getting a car with an MOT, and just leaving it. I took my Mum. [laughs] She says, "What you mean, come to Spain?" "We're in the final at the weekend, You're coming to Spain". "Oh, that'll be lovely." She said "I've never been on an aeroplane before." Rangers fans were just delighted to be there, but there was a sense of anticipation, that this time, third time lucky, might be the season that they actually lift that European Trophy. I think there was a presumption around Ibrox that because Rangers had beat Bayern Munich. The hard work was, was done, knowing nothing about Moscow Dynamo. I've got to stress to you, you didn't know about these players. You'd never seen them play, unless they'd been on the TV, which was very, very rare. Well, I think when you've beat the favorites you've still got to have the same attitude, which is a big thing in football: the right attitude to play in a final, when you've never seen them playing. Till Waddell got some of the pictures of their players and that you didnae know who you were playing. Every game... they went and analysed opponents, right from the first round against Rennes. Now this was a different question, how do you get behind the Iron Curtain, to spy on a team from Moscow. The Russians weren't happy to hand out visas like confetti, but Willie Waddell found a way. He had friends in the right places to pull strings, to get he and Jock Wallace into Russia, to watch, in the flesh, Moscow Dynamo. You just look at their run to the final, and they're winning, they won all their away games apart from the semifinal, a home leg with Dynamo Berlin. They were good footballers, and a big country. Russia, at that time, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, they were big, they were massive. They were competitive in everything they did, whether it was gymnastics, or football. They were just bred as athletes. We did the training and, midway through the training, we lost our centre-half, Colin Jackson, he went over on his ankle. SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC Colin was ruled out, prior to the big game against... Moscow Dynamo. Big Ronnie McKinnon had broke his leg in Lisbon. That meant two centre-halves, we'd lost Ronnie McKinnon, We'd lost Colin Jackson, we'd no centre-half. In the final, it was Derek Johntsone and Dave Smith. I was told I was playing in the afternoon, and I was playing alongside Dave Smith, who I hadn't played with before. You know this was the first the two center halves were together, in this game. And the night before the game, John Greig was... extremely doubtful at that point, because of an injury, whether he was gonna play or not. I had fractured my metatarsal joint. In the morning of the match when I woke up, I couldnae put my foot on the ground, I was in agony. Waddell 110% wanted John Greig to play. Waddell 110% wanted John Greig to play. I don't think he was fit, but there was no way he wasnae going to play like, that was John Greig. Make no mistake, John Greig should not have played in the final, in Barcelona. But somehow the medics patched him up. And saying that, I think they probably would need to have anesthetized him not to have him play. I remember arriving very early at the stadium and the Rangers supporters were on the pitch and it was like Sunday strolling in the park, walking all over the pitch with the police just looking at them. It was so friendly, as if the Spaniards were saying, "Welcome to Barcelona." Fans invading the park. It was well known, it was done for years. That in itself contained the seeds of what happened later. because the police really should have been saying "This is sacred territory. You don't get on it." When we drove in to get into the Nou Camp, it was just like going into Ibrox, it was a mass of blue, and in fact they were rocking the bus. And it was deafening, and so that's the first time we've seen or heard the crowd. ORCHESTRAL MUSIC I remember getting very emotional, seeing all the supporters with their scarves and their flags. Thinking to myself, we've really got to do it this time for them. There's always pressure on Rangers players, Rangers have to win. If you don't win you're gonna be criticized, a lot. By the papers, the fans, and probably, if you're being honest, with yourself because how big an opportunity is it, to play Moscow Dynamo, in the Nou Camp in front of Rangers supporters because there was very few Russian supporters there. It was like a home game to us. We think we thought, "This is ours lads, this is ours, We've got to believe we can do this." Deedle give to me what was a good talk. You know, he was saying to us, "Remember now" he says, "There's people in villages, there's people in towns, there's people in cities, countries, millions and millions, all around the world, sitting and waiting on this result." He says "Go out and do it for them." "Don't do it for yourself, do it for them" he says. "And then you'll be heroes." We'll probably not get another, another chance, you know. The last chance. MATCH WHISTLE INTENSE MUSIC Their main player was a guy called Sabo. He was the one that made them tick, he was the guy that got on the ball and made things happen. Willie Waddell I remember saying to John Greig he said, "Hey, listen, the captain is their top man everything goes through him." He says "I want you to sort him out early." So the ball got centered, kicked back, and it got played to Sabo, and Greigy hit him. He whacked the boy. Oof! The game had just started and the ball broke between the two of us, and I thought, "Well, if I don't go in for this, I'm gonna get hurt." So I went in and clattered him and he walked away without saying a word and I walked away. So that was it. Everyone in the stadium from a Rangers perspective went "Captain's back." That guy Sabo never kicked a ball, till late in the second half. for an unfit man, he did, he did his job well. [commentator] Mathieson, Smith, Greig. I remember the first 15, 20 minutes, I'm just, "Slow it down, calm yourself, get a grip of the ball." F*cking going everywhere. [commentator] Dave Smith. Dave Smith, Willie Johnston, John Grieg, Sandy Jardine, are absolutely determined that they are not going to lose another European final. The guys that were there in 67. Dave Smith has that bit of class that bit of concentration, that bit of skill, that he sets up the... he plays an electric ball. [commentator] Dave Smith. Over to Colin Stein. Goal! Fantastic goal, incredible! Colin Stein! A tremendous piece of football and he just rifles it into the top corner. FUNK ROCK MUSIC Sandy Jardine won a tackle on the halfway line which he never usually did, and gave the ball to Dave Smith, who chucked it forward to me and I just whacked it right in the net. Oh! What a feeling that is, a European final and you've scored the first goal, the fans are going absolutely berserk. I turned round and there was hundreds and hundreds on the park. [commentator] And the fans are on the pitch! They run on the pitch, and the game gets held up for five minutes while they all get off. We're trying to help them off you know "Come on, come on get off!" And the same happened the second goal, Dave Smith got the ball on the right half [commentator] Smith again. Good ball. It's a goal! Willie Johnston! CROWD CHEER Dave Smith, a master of his trade with the ball at his feet. The two assists you see, as my friends would say, two long punts up the park. I can remember looking at Davie and putting my hands in my head and going "Are we really two-nothing up?" but the turning point is in the second half. The kick out from Peter McCloy. I used to hit it very high. Over the years we got a lot of goals off it for the Rangers. [commentator] Johnston is through. Goal! Goal by Johnston! Willie Johnston just takes it and controls it and just puts it away. The Russians were like rabbits in headlights. It seems as if the game is over. Then all of a sudden, the Russians realise, "We need to make a fist of this." And they found a way to try and muscle their way back into the game. [commentator] The Russians are attacking. INTENSE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC Goal! And then, 3-1. I think the biggest problem is I think we saw the winning post to early We definitely... went to sleep. Lost concentration. We were definitely getting a wee bit tired, you know. And the polo necks were getting to us as well. Polo necks in Spain. They should never have been in sight of us, because we were a far, far better team than them. [commentator] Goal again! Moscow Dynamo score with only three minutes of the game remaining and that three goal cushion has evaporated into one. Rangers were running on empty. The tank was in the red. And all of a sudden they start coming forward. So we're having to defend a lot more. The Rangers fans are quiet. They're starting to panic a wee bit now. From then on in you're saying, "Not again, It's not going to happen again." You know. If I've ever, glad to hear a final whistle, that would have been the night. [commentator] Oh! the crowd on the pitch again! Referee blew for the free kick and the fans come on and it wasnae, it wasnae the end of the game, they had to kind of back off. We've still got another two minutes to go. They thought it was the final whistle. Invading the park is what you did in those days. [commentator] Oh, my oh my, the game's not over yet. As I was doing the commentary, one supporter came and sat on my knee and offered me a drink of Fundador, which is that firewater Spanish brandy, which you shouldn't really touch with a bargepole. They were in seventh heaven. They thought it was all over. It was just chaos. I mean, it was just fans everywhere. We can argue about it all day, it was an accident. We thought it was full time. [commentator] They'll have to clear the pitch and play the remaining time. They just made a mistake. Off they went. INTENSE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC However close it looked on paper, the memories, I think of '67 were definitely there in the back of the mind that night and it wasn't going to happen again. [commentator] Stein. Johnston. MacDonald. It's getting quite physical. They weren't letting that go, there was just no way that was going to happen again. [commentator] We're expecting the final whistle at any moment now. The Rangers fans watch on... waiting. There's no way Rangers were letting this, letting this slip. REFEREES WHISTLE [commentator] And there we have it. Rangers are the winners of the European Cup Winners' Cup. The supporters are flooding on! What a sight to behold! UPLIFTING MUSIC You can see how much it means. CROWD CHEERING We can't see the players anymore. It's a sea of people. What incredible scenes! They've waited a long time for this. EMOTIONAL PIANO MUSIC It's probably the most wonderful feeling I've ever had. Tremendous... atmosphere it was like, you know. And of course with 25,000 Scotsmen, full of sangria. [Laughs] It was just euphoria, flooding onto the pitch. and manifesting itself in that way. this was, this was just that rush of, of just pure celebration. You never forget that euphoria, it's the most wonderful memory, you'll never, you'll never beat it. Well I ran into the... down the stairs, and then Willie Johnston come in after me. Steiny was waiting on me, and he says, "What took you so long?" I says "You seen out there?" There was hundreds of people on the park and it's the first time I've ever beat him at running. CROWD CHANTING They're cuddling you and... following you. You cannae see me. I mean, they're all a good six foot aye. To them it was just... emotion, you know. They'd won a European trophy like, you know. CROWD CHANTING [commentator] The police haven't got a chance. The players, Willie Waddell, they're all in there. The police. They started thumping 'em with big batons. Not just wee batons. The Glaswegians are no... they'll no back down. Spain was run by the Dictator: Franco, and it was his fascist police who took the heavy hand and charged the Rangers fans. They were just happy, delirious, there was not any trouble. But, they should just have let them run mad for 10 minutes. The police got it wrong, I think, you know, they really did. Typical Glasgow boy, you don't hit me, you don't get hit back. You know. ATMOSPHERIC MUSIC They got us off the pitch as quick as possible. They escorted us into the dressing room. Yeah, it became apparent that there could be no trophy presentation. You know, there was too much trouble going on outside. Obviously in the dressing room we didnae know what was happening to be honest with you. Just sitting there waiting to get an answer. You know, "Are we going to get the cup or not?" And then all of a sudden, Waddell and John Greig was called to a, some wee room away in the stadium somewhere. I'm sure that we ended up in the Barcelona... trophy room. There's all these officials and I think they were all UEFA officials that night. and the guy, I don't, I don't know what he said, but it sounded as if he was saying "1972 European Cup Winners' Cup, winners: Glasgow Rangers, here... now on yous go, on your bike" DISCO FUNK MUSIC Till we got back to the dressing room and we got in there, and we handed the cup over to the boys and the boys went daft when they saw the cup and that. Well when they come in with the cup, that was it, we knew we'd won it, so... it was party time. PLAYERS CHEERING I remember him, he just ran into the dressing room. we were all in the bath and he threw the cup in the bath and we all jumped about and had a right a good laugh. It was absolutely wonderful. PLAYERS CHEERING It was great you know, Just everybody's overjoyed and It's hard to put words into it, you know you're It's hard to put words into it, you know you're that excited and the adrenaline is still flowing. It was, it was, it was one of the nights you would nae, you would nae forget. Then we went back to... up to our hotel. The champagne was flowing. Rightly so [laughs]. I can remember all the wifes and the mums coming back to the hotel. My Mum had two wee glasses of sherry and went to bed early. [Laughs] Dave Smith, and Greigy, and myself. I don't think we went to bed. There wasn't a drink left in the hotel that night. I was never a big drinker. You know I was, "God sake lads, I'm not... I'm not drinking." "I'm, I'm 18 and a half. I don't want to drink." And Steiny "Come on, son, have a drink, have a drink." Waking up in the morning with a banging head, which I'd never had before. I guess that's a hangover for you. And what a lot of people don't know is that the trophy in the morning had a dent in it. Me and John Greig had it. We shared a room and we looked at the trophy and there was a dent in the side, but they got fixed. We were very fortunate. Colin Jackson's father was on the bus. So he drove us up, they got the bus to take us up to the hotel. And he asked Willie Waddell if he could get the players down with the Cup because we never seen the Cup getting presented at the end of the game. John Grieg came down with the Cup, all the players. And I went down and got to hold the Cup with John. Holding the Cup with John Greig. Highlight of my life. Of course a lot of the fans were still in Barcelona, when we paraded the Cup at Ibrox the next night. The thing was my family was still in Barcelona. [laughs] So there was nobody in the house. FUNK MUSIC We went back to Ibrox. What was waiting for us? A big limousine, weren't it. Called a coal lorry. [laughs] A coal lorry. And it... peeing with rain [laughs] And that's the type of thing that we were used to. I don't know if the coal man had just finished his shift and was still driving. I dont know. [laughs] Trying to balance yourself standing on the end. Went round the track with the Cup. Class act. Hey. "Anybody wanna bag of coal? Anybody wanna bag of coal?" BAGPIPES PLAYING At the time... it's not seen as being as glamorous or glorious as the as the players would've imagined it. There's a tatty old Union Jack on the front of the truck that's kind of fallen off. But, whether they like it or not, that's what I grew up with. and that's, you know, as Rangers supporters we've taken that to our heart. That kind of chaos. You know, the chaos of the Sporting game, The chaos after the final, you know, not being able to get the trophy, and it's part of what we love about the club. UPLIFTING ORCHESTRAL MUSIC The supporters, you know, are eveything to-to Rangers Football Club. To get a Cup... a European Cup and bring it back to them, well that's the pinnacle innit? The pinnacle of your career. And as we got to the Broomloan Road end there was a guy standing there and it was pouring with rain, he was standing there waving his scarf, and it was Bobby Shearer. Bobby Shearer used to be the captain of Rangers. He was in the crowd. It hit me at that point, there was a legend. Not in the stand or, or in the... directors box. just standing on the terrace, waving a Rangers scarf. You know. An out and out legend. That's when it hit me like, you know. The players enjoyed it. There's no doubt at all the players enjoyed it. I mean, it was the biggest, the biggest day in most of their lives, the day in biggest in my life, and this club's life, winning a European Trophy. CROWD CHEER When you pull theat jersey over your head, it's a tremendous experience. And it's not about you, as Willie Waddell says "The millions and millions of people all around the world who are sitting and waiting on that result on that day like, you know, it's about them. It's about the people on the terracing." I think winning, meant everything, meant so much to the supporters after everything that had gone before. But it just gave a... hope, a sense of pride. Oh I certainly think the Rangers supporters needed it. I needed it. And the players that played in the '67 needed it. The club needed it. There's no question about that. What is that moment that you're going to be remembered for, for all time, what in 50 years time are you going to be looking back at thinking, "Yeah, I did that. I was part of that." And, and there's very few people probably in the world that are lucky enough to have that moment. And I look at... you know, for example, my Dad. Eight years, more than 300 games, that 90 minutes in Barcelona, is, is it. That's what his life, his career, is, is defined by. And there's lots of players in that team who went on to win lots more leagues, trebles, cups momentous occasions, scored so many goals, but they'll still be forever defined by Barcelona and that's... special. It's quite remarkable. You can go through a lifetime and you don't know in that that moment in time that this is what's, what's going to define you. But it does. REFLECTIVE PIANO MUSIC I look back and I'm thinking it was just yesterday. You wonder where the 50 years has gone because it doesn't seem that long ago. We didn't think an awful lot that we could maybe do it again but, things have changed. As you know. You don't want to be just an 11 or 19 players involved. You want other players to get the, the, the feeling of doing it as well you know because it's it's with you for life. You know, naebody can take it away from you. You never come down from that, you know that remains with you, you've won that trophy and it's... it's special. I was playing football and what could be better in life than getting paid for doing something you'd be doing if you weren't 'been paid. I just loved it. You know, you don't realise you know, that we're just ordinary people. I'm just happy I've done it, been there, seen it. Barcelona 72's about a moment in time that... changed a club forever. Change a city. It's 90 minutes that made heroes, made legends. MUSIC:'Here's to My Old Friends' by Ellen Smith They'd had an awful lot of different experiences they'd shared together, some good, some really, really, painful and poignant experiences together and I doubt there's another group of players that have been through what they went through together. # Here's to my old friends # # I miss you every day # # I miss you every day # Peter McCloy, the gentle giant. 'The Girvan Lighthouse.' It was me that named him that, you know being so tall obviously Mr. Sensible. Good lad Peter. Big Ronnie, 'Clint Eastwood', I used to call him. Very calm cool lad, you know. I couldnae say anything bad about him, great guy. Ah my mate, my mucker. my roommate for best part of ten years. Only 18, 19 year old to play, playing in a European Final. Must have been tremendous for him. # So here's to the old times # 'The Quiet Assassin' I call Willie. Think he was an unsung hero Willie. Very, very underrated football player. Willie Henderson. He's still the same wee arrogant boy he was then, and a nicer wee guy you'll never meet in your life. Wonderful little lad. Everyone played there part in that campaign, incluiding: Penman, Fyfe, and Denny Parlane, good player, always played well against Celtic. Good in the air, could pass a ball, Derek was an overall good player. Super guy. Dave Smith: 'Mr. Quiet Man'. He was just exceptional, and he was a good talker as well to the players around him. Davie used to take players on in our penalty box. I'd be screaming at him, "Get that ball out of there, get it out of there!" Tommy McLean, could land a ball on a six pence. It was unbelievable to watch him. He was a good man to have in your team, he was a good lad as well. Doddie aye, a great wee person. 'Mr. Slide Tackler' I call him. Typical little Glasgow guy. If you cut the wee mans arm, he'd bleed blue blood. Rangers through and through. Alfie Conn was a great midfield player, good lad off the park as well. Alfie was an awful nice lad. Is still an awful nice lad. Colin Jackson. He was the best center-half we had, he was solid, a great marker. A good defender and a real Ranger. He was the life and soul of the dressing room, not in ways that you'd want him to be. Because he'd be a pest. One of my best friends from football. Ahh... I love him. # Here's to my old friends # Great personality, and one of my best friends. He was a top character, you know. A wonderful lad to be beside, great company. He still is to me, probably one of the best young players that's ever been at this club. # Here's to the old times # We used to be like two brothers really, we shared a room for many years. He would have run through brick walls John. That's just the way he was. He was a tremendous leader on the park and... he drove us on. Sandy, Sandy was a class act. He really encapsulated everything He really encapsulated everything that a Ranger should be. Difficult to find words for Sandy because we traveled together for so many years together. It's hard for us to accept he's gone, you know. I wished he was here. # But you'll still live as hopeful as # # the days we had together # Willie Waddlle said to us after the game, "You won this trophy. In 50 years time they'll be talking about this." He was good for Rangers there's no question of about it. He knew what he was doing, He knew what he was doing. Although he appeared a hard person, he had his soft sides as well. # So here's to my old friends # he was always very, very good to me. I feel I owe him a debt of gratitude. [Director] If you could say something to Waddell now, What would it be? If I could say something to Waddell? I'd say, "Willie, why did you not turn that light to green more often when I was coming up to talk to you?" First thing I would say to him, "You never gave me the £10 rise you offered me." [Laughs] That'd be a starter. What would I say to him? Firstly I'd say "How's it going?" "What were your feelings, actually, when we won that cup, and you realised we were the first Rangers team to win it?" Quite simply I would just say "Thanks for everything Boss." "Thanks." He definitely changed me, you know. # Miss you every day # I would say "Thank you." A big thank you. To say well he gave me a good break, you know, and I... can't say enough about Willie I don't think. [whispers] Oh dear. He certainly made me a player. There's not much I can say because... he changed me. # And leave our faces changed # "I miss the arguments Boss." That's what I would say to Willie Waddell. "Well done, Mr. Waddell. and I miss the arguments." That's what I think I would say. # Leave our faces changed # # But we'll still live as hopeful # # as the days we had together. #
