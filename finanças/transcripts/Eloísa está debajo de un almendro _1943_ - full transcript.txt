Finally, I pray that when you receive your doctoral diplomas and leave here forever you will not forget your old Lyceum teachers, who will follow you in spirit everywhere. Lefranc, Jean. Good luck, son. Renoir, Rene. Junie, Louis. Ojeda y Duran, Fernando. Congratulations. Fernando. Aren't you staying to the end? We'll say goodbye later. I'm not leaving for Spain until tonight. Hello, Dimas. Don't you know me? Master Fernando! Yes, it's Master Fernando. - It appears so. And Uncle Ezekiel? Upstairs in the laboratory. - I'm looking forward to seeing him. What? - Where are you going? To see Uncle Ezekiel. Didn't you say he was in the lab? Yes, upstairs, but... it would be better if you stayed here. What? - I'll go up and inform him. He's so odd that he doesn't wish anyone to disturb him. Now the Master realizes. I'll be right back. What do you want? Haven't I told you not to bother me? Excuse me, it's that the gentleman has come, Fernando. Fernando? - Yes, sir. And as he intended to come up here. - Come up here? No sir, no sir. I say he intended. But I didn't let him, me, he's downstairs. - Downstairs. Go now, in case he comes up. But you haven't told him what I've been doing? Good heavens, don't worry. I haven't told him anything. Fernando, my boy! I didn't expect you! - Uncle Ezekiel. Why didn't you tell me? I preferred to surprise you. And I was so eager to get here. At least you could have warned me you wouldn't warn me. A good journey? What about Belgium? Still feeling blue? The same. Year after year pining for home. I must warn you, this home isn't so much. And you? Never out of your laboratory? Now I do nothing. Amusing myself, trifles, in short, nothing. Fernando, want anything? I ate an hour ago. Dimas, Dimas! - Coming, coming. Do you want something, Sir? What should I want? Dinner for Master Fernando. Didn't you think that he needs his dinner? These days you're in a world of your own. Not hearing, seeing, nor understanding. Cigarette? - Thanks, but I must rest. Your room is upstairs, just as when you left for Belgium. I wanted to preserve it like the Ark during the flood. All right. I'll be down on half an hour. Off you go. I forgot! In the desk drawer you'll find a letter. A letter? From whom? From your father. He instructed me on his death bed, to give it you on your return. It's been there for ten years. - I'll look for it. Poor Dad. For my son Fernando and now you are a man you must know, my son, that I abandon this world for not having dared to unravel the mysterious death of the woman I loved most of all. And in this supreme moment, I ask only that you devote your life to shedding light on the tragedy and if you discover the culprit's identity, pursue them to the very end. Uncle! Uncle Ezekiel! - What is it? What's wrong? Read this letter. Read it right now. What horror! - You're taking it too badly. Come, in here. - Too badly? Yes, the sad end of your father you already knew, since I wrote you in Belgium. Yes, it's true, but not the crime committed here so mysteriously. Not his last love. You knew. - Partly, I knew your father in his final days, was in love platonically, but I didn't knew the mysterious Julieta, nor least suspect the terrible puppet. Uncle - Your father, forgive me, was... Crazy! You want to say that my father was crazy. Lad, what nonsense. What is crazy after all. Obsessed, nothing more. Somewhat unhinged. What are you saying! - Yes, it's in the family. You need to rest. Lie down, get some shut eye and try to mentally extract the square root of 9003. See how quickly you'll fall asleep. See you tomorrow. Come in! Did you want something, Sir? - Come here. Do you swear to tell the truth? The whole truth? - You frighten me. What does uncle mean that my father was crazy? - Crazy? He was as mad as a hatter... better say no more. And who was that woman that my father fell in love with and then died here in mysterious circumstances? I don't know what you're talking about. You must know. You've been serving my family for over 30 years. Of course I'm aware of everything that has happened. But I swear, of the woman you refer to and her death, I've not heard the least report. No? - Since we came to live in this house, there's been no woman. As for your father, becoming crazy in his final days, they always exaggerate, Yes, strange things he did, but raving mad he was not. - Strange things? What he was doing? He spent hours out there under the almond trees, on the ground. Sometimes, he locked himself in the attic and when he was inside, bumps and noises were heard. Take me to the attic! Right now. Was it here? - Yes, sir. Leave me alone. Regarding the tax on transfer of property, it amounts to 46,832.65. They are definitively canceled, all contracted commitments... Okay, you can spare yourself any more paper. You're an ideal tutor. - Thanks. The only thing that I couldn't solve is the case of the Briones family. Why? - For many reasons. I gave up because they're all a flock of goats. There's no understanding them. The father had a disappointment in love, in his youth. He took to his bed 10 years ago and hasn't got up since. The sister collects owls, the daughters don't talk and Clotilde, I prefer not to say. - What's with Clotilde? Is she crazier than the rest? - No, she's driving me crazy. I'll visit them this afternoon. Where do they live? In an old mansion, Stadium Avenue. It's distinguished by the absurd tower attached to it. Hey there! It's you, I hadn't realised. I was having a spot of relaxation. Come. It's a good time to talk to the Master. You've learned the interrogation well? - Yes, I remember it perfectly. God forbid you put your foot in your mouth. What about the furniture? Are they moving? Come! Don't bump into the furniture. Of course - Don't brush against it! Not an inch from where they are. There was a servant, six years ago who whilst cleaning, moved that sofa and had to go to Havana. and died of yellow fever. - Infected? Of disgust. You must know where everything goes. I know, but the salary... - Regarding the salaries in this house... They are unique in Madrid, but friend, things happen here, even with the salary. Cooks, I've known 29. - I wouldn't want your stomach. Drivers, crowds. Maids, clouds. And gardeners, forests. And I've come to the point I can't take any more. And when you whistle, I will leave whistling. The best cough drops. - I have no cough, nor believe in the effectiveness of the pills you recommend. The Master. - Who's he talking with? The radio announcer. They are incompatible. Ferm?n! - Sir. What are you doing. - I'm with the new servant. Bring him to me, to see if I like him. - I think you will. No, that way leads to the large console! The shooting range there, the bed here. Follow me carefully. - Ferm?n! We're en route, Sir! You can see why I was running in the hall. It's my nerves. There's no walking in a straight line, so I let off steam by galloping out there. Smarten yourself up a bit. If you don't make a good first impression, we are lost. Ferm?n, are you coming or not? - Of course! One last bend and here we are. At your command, Sir. - About time, man. Is this the new applicant? - It is, Sir. What a stupid face. The Master doesn't like servants with lively faces. The main point is prudence, to see if he can get used to the customs of the family. Take it slowly, it's not easy. - It's not easy. I realise that. Let's see. Come here. Where are you from? - Soria. - Your favourite colour? - Gray. Would women dominate you? - They cannot. How are oil paintings cleaned? - With soap and water. Do you know the main railway lines? Today I started to teach them. What do owls eat? - Oil and fried meats. - Do you smoke? - Cacao. Do you drink? - Water when thirsty. Wine when offered. Are you annoyed by people, nervous or intemperate, excitable and a little unstable? - Such people delight me. What watch do you wear? - Longines. Are you surprised I've spent 10 years without getting up? It could happen to anyone. And silk embroidery? - I don't know how, Sir. It's a regret my parents never taught me to embroider. But they couldn't see beyond their noses. Well, okay. Excellent. Get down. Close your eyes, turn around and straight forward. Practical exercise. Remember everything I told you. Above all, don't be embarrassed. Where has the bell rung? - In... the salon. What salon! Where? In the hall. I don't want any hesitation. And this? - This... In the library. And this? - In the billiard room. Good. Wait, don't turn around just yet. Does it bother you, the shot? Rather it gives me a pleasant feeling. Ferm?n, I think this guy will do. Now let's see if he understands something of furniture styles. Come in. Miss is expecting you. The piano tuner? Come, I'll tell Micaela. You don't sell owls? May I speak! - I can't get a word in. Right? I can't get a word in. It's the Mistress you wish to see, the Master. No... yes? Yes, yes, yes! Don Edgardo Briones, to talk about the property. Don't interrupt. My card. - Follow me, Sir. You only had to say. If you'd said what you wanted, I wouldn't have to guess. Sometimes one can't guess a thing. Would you care to wait? Yes, no? The Master won't place furniture in the hall for visitors, so they'll get bored and leave. Wait right here? Yes, no? I'll be right back. Take a seat! There's one there. This is the dining room, Sir. And opposite a bowl of XVII century. And the chairs? The chairs are of the... - Twentieth. They are... - There's a man who wants to see the master. Why? I don't know. Is the young master available? You're not speaking. A servant, sir. I know the gentleman? The voice, I have a card for the young master. I do not want to hear your blathering, nor wish to receive unfortunate visitors. Go away! - Yes, Sir. Take the card? Yes, no? I'll return it? The card is yours, it's gone. Another loony in the family. - No, she's Micaela's companion. And of sound mind. - Of sound mind? Yes. Did you notice something odd about her? Take your card, Master won't receive you. He's in conference with the servants, you understand. We can't both speak together. Are you going? But what a fool, you know the way. You'll get lost? Yes, no? I thought you'd get lost amongst the furniture. Goodbye. - Bon voyage. Why are you here? What do you want? Sorry, you are the same. Exactly. No doubt about it. - Who are you? I didn't ring for a servant? - Sorry. I mistook the door, I'm going. My respects. Ferm?n! Ferm?n! Pr?xedes! Pr?xedes! Where are you? What's that man doing here? Who called you? Why has he come? - To see the Master. He didn't see him. - Shut up! It's terrible. Again, that man. It's her, uncle. I saw her. She spoke to me. - The portrait? No, her. In person. Hallucinations! Delusions won't leave you alone. I'll end up crazy because of you. Wouldn't it be better to tell me the truth? That woman and that picture may clarify the mystery. - No mystery. Your father was like you, and you are like him. And I, like you both. Uncle Ezekiel! - No offence, but a chip off the old block. I also have my manias, but I don't presume. Enough of this gibberish, help me out of this nightmare. D'you want to, if not... Oh God! That girl's on my mind. I'll help. We'll go to the Briones' house. Talk to Mariana, you'll meet her aunt and see Clotilde, what a woman. It's a madhouse. But it's nothing but trouble. Ezekiel, come here. What is it? - My niece. My nephew, I'll call him. - Do you envy him? Why? Everyone's 25 at heart. - What modesty! Yes, I don't like to boast of age. Me neither. - Ladies like you, never age. - You are a gentleman. With a full beard. In his words, in his silences. There is something inexplicable. Dark. Haven't you noticed? I feel we've come into this world to unite, and we already have done. But sometimes his eyes look like any other's. His gestures are like those of anyone. His silences are empty, he is an ordinary man. He laughs, jokes and I feel we have nothing in common. I hate him. I fear not ever knowing. The sleepless nights, the house full of mystery. The past torturing me. And me alone with the obsession of this nightmare from which I can never awake. - Go on. I'm excited by all this. - You have to help me, to decipher that enigma. Me? But how, Fernando? Come with me, I'll go crazy if you don't help me. In this terrible house, you can be a shining light. Please decide. Go to the concert tonight with your aunt Clotilde. In the first interval, go to the lobby. There I'll be waiting. Will you abduct me? - You will save me from this madness. I'll go. Oh, you'll kill us! - I don't care. - You, me, no. You're crazy! Why we have we dumped Fernando and your uncle? I'm going home with Fernando. With your nerves, you'll kill us. We'll go wherever you want. I can't stay here. What atmosphere! - It's Thursday and packed. I'll get the air freshener. An excellent idea. Shhh. - But it's a silent film? When I see these films it's like being at home. Don't exaggerate, Clotilde. - It's they who exaggerate. Watch out when you go to Fernando's home. Judging by its inhabitants, there must be something. The Ojedas are not what you call normal? What, two madmen, uncle and nephew! Shh. Shut up! Does he seem crazy to you too? - I said uncle and nephew. You admit then that Fernando may be different from the others. I admit everything. As for his uncle Ezequiel, I need only see his beard and fungus to feel a choking sensation. But Fernando... Do you think...? Now the air freshener. We're being sprayed like flies. Lady, it's quite healthy. Aunt Clotilde, do you think Fernando could keep a most important secret, never revealed? - I wouldn't be surprised. How happy you make me. Do you need a mysterious man who hides something, to be happy? Yes. And when he discovers that everything in his life is simple and normal, if I can't face things for the worse, at least I'll break with him. There! The cinema entrance. We're looking for two ladies in evening dress. Like you, but without tie. Here. Candy, ice cream! Look, Fernando. Candy, ice cream! I didn't think tonight you'd come back to say hello. You're really disconcerting. The disconcerting one is you. Some men are bulls. - What bulls, ma'am? Don't refer to the bull-fight that you do to us. Mariana has her reasons for playing hide and seek with Fernando. But perhaps it's a bit much you and I get back together. Tell me it's true that you need me. That I can save you. Only you can bring peace to my soul. Help me, come with me. For the last time I ask you. I just came to accompany Fernando. - Of course. There are women who lead men, tied to the carriage of their beauty. But there are men who will not be tied down to any beautiful carriage. Not any carriage. The carriage is stuck? Are you trying to tell me something? - As you're not listening to me and this man has no desire to talk, why continue? - I was distracted. I'm glad that my conversation distracted you. The things he says, Uncle Ezekiel! What's wrong! - Nothing. Let's go. Don't touch me, don't look at me. The night will end in the best way possible. Where are you going? - With them. - I'm not! I am. I need her in the house. I have to take her today, either way. Try it, go. - You have the bottle? Take it and good luck. One of the ladies, the elder, he has given me this paper to give it surreptitiously. A light for a moment? At 12, by the small garden gate. Clotilde When it's 11:45 would you kindly tell me. Yes, sir. -Take this. Just time to see a bit of the film. With accompanying saxophone. Come in. Sir sends me to ask for the keys to prepare the luggage. In a few moments we'll leave for San Sebastian. Tonight? Did you say tonight? Yes, ma'am. The train leaves in a few minutes. Tonight, no. Remember that other time when Julia disappeared? Another misfortune will happen. Come, come, we must stop it, No matter how. You took care of the snack? - Yes, Sir. Is the the train delayed? - No, Sir. We are in the departure station. - Spot on. You're incorrigible! Am I crazy or are you off to San Sebastian? - Both, Micaela. You insist on that route, Edgardo. Someday you'll say something witty. Besides sarcasm, I ask myself: Can't you go to San Sebasti?n on any other night than tonight? Why should I not go tonight? - There are thieves on the way. I've told you since Monday. - But Micaela. - Don't argue. I won't discuss it. - I know and I won't argue. Ferm?n, isolate me. - Yes, sir. Isolating yourself will not avoid thieves. But I can still see and hear you, Micaela. I tell you, this is a madhouse. Going to San Sebastian tonight! Of all nights. With thieves at the door. What a disaster! What's with the thieves? They insist the thieves are coming every other day. Let's sort the luggage. She's more upset than the Master. Any pretext to stay awake at night. Walking with the dogs in the garden. - If only the dogs could speak. I think they're learning. Seven minutes until the train for San Sebastian! Have to sort it in a hurry! Hey! The San Sebastian is real. But, of course! Sir is traveling, but in bed. So you have to learn all the routes. Sir sometimes sleeps whilst traveling, but you have to be awake all night to ring the bell, sing the names and shout the specializations of the city. Do you stop at many places? - Tonight Sir is on the mail train. But other nights, in a hurry, he takes the express. and everything's more bearable. And that screen? - To project views of the major places. With this projector, that we must always handle with great care. - Who handles it? The master is in charge. - Is it time? Yes, they'll announce the departure. Do you have the tickets? Have you checked? Yes, and here's the hand luggage. - Has no one come to say goodbye? No one, sir. - Good. Goodbyes are so sad. - What imagination! Can I announce departure? - Carry on. We're quite late, but we'll make it up tomorrow in Alsasua. When the train pulls out, I've not found a disk. I'm going to take a nap until Villalba. There's a stop at Torrelodones. - If I fall sleep, don't wake me. Very good. Traveling like this, is he ever derailed? You want to stay in this house? - I have my doubts. I was afraid so, 3 candidates backed out seeing this. Seeing this, Emilio Salgari too. May I? No one. They've all gone to San Sebastian. I see, I don't see them. And if I do see them, there's no one. Don't shout. You'll have him believe we're in Burgos. I'll keep quiet. I've been summoned. Who? Madame. What do I bring? Dinner. Tonight we keep vigil. - Quiet! Quiet!! What a ruffian! Always in high gear. Yes, no! The Mistress! - What's this racket? Nothing, I'm setting the table. Never. On nights like this I can't be separated from the others. You can bring my dinner. Ferm?n, is the Master still traveling? Yes, ma'am. We've just passed El Plantio. He must be as mad as a hatter to travel like that. In five years serving my brother you're as bad as he is. But it's time for refreshments. Las Matas, one minute! Madame, the new one has said all there is to say. Mariana. One moment. Don't run away from me. I won't. - I didn't notice you. Why don't you try playing hide and seek? This does me no good. I'm going to change, I won't be long. Wait for me. God bless you. - What? This warm welcome. Saying you won't desert me. Because if you'd rejected me I don't know what would have become of me Good evening. - Are you coming or going? Coming, to go I wouldn't be going from outside to in. Always making trouble. - Edgardo where is he? 15 minutes ago he left for San Sebastian. Let me know when you go to Valencia, I want to see the floats. To avoid it happening to us both, only depends on you. Me alone? - Yes. There would be no change in me if there were none in you. My will is yours. But you... When you change, it's because you make a violent effort to change. Have you noticed? - Is it true? Is it true you're hiding something from me? Don't deny it. Am I the only key to this enigma? Me alone, are you sure? No woman could replace me? - None. A woman cleverer than me? Prettier than me? No one but you. - What if I had another face? Would you care? This mystery attracts me, scares me, but if it doesn't make me tremble, You wouldn't be you, nor would I be willing to go to there. Will you come tonight? See it through? Yes, I'll go. I realized that by day you still have the strength to endure, and it's the night that terrifies you. Am I wrong? - No. Then I'll explore. All that you've described I'm looking forward to knowing. You open the door to the light. I await you. What happiness! Suddenly, the door opens and what awaits us inside? - Antique furniture, blurred pictures. What else? - An old servant who doesn't see, hear or understand. What else? - Dust, because the old man hardly cleans, or not at all. What else - Perhaps a bottle of vintage wine, to recover from the shock. Nothing else? - My hugs. And my kisses. Are you leaving? - Yes. To change my clothes. This dress is inappropriate for a glass of wine. I'll be right shortly. Mariana. Let me explain. - You have nothing to explain. Good evening, sir. - Hello, Ferm?n. How are you? As always, en route. What station did you buy that milk? - Villalba, it's the speciality. The only good thing about these trips, Sir authorises us to drink the products each station. The last trip we took to Galicia, I got tired of lobsters and Ribeiro wine. You're certainly well fed. - Thanks to the Master, I'm fed up. I can't wait for the replacement to take over his position. Because of my middle-age spread. Now I can't walk up or down stairs without counting each one. No wonder. Would you like enter my service? If the gentleman desires, it's for me. - Here. First month's advance. 80 cash. There's no need! - Keep it. In a few minutes go to the library, so we can talk in private. Yes, Commissioner speaking. What d'you say? In the street... Your name? Thanks. Is agent Perea here yet? Send him in immediately. May I come in? - Of course. I've received some new information about the property by the lake. Something may happen sooner than expected. Go there tonight with two more agents. Sir, you can have complete faith in me. I can bring about more than anyone. Believe me, I assure you. Thief! What is it? Control those dogs. - And that lady too. Hurry! Did the dogs bite? With those teeth? The dogs did nothing but bark. Shut it well! - Don't you worry. I'm here. It was before and I saw you. I was almost the dog's dinner. Are you hurt? What are you doing here? Get out! Scoundrel! Go away! Go away! Get out! - Lady, I... Get him out! Get out! Get out! - He's going. He's going, Aunt Micaela. Don't get excited. Come on, let's take watch in the garden. I'll accompany you. We'll talk and you can tell me. Infamy, to have returned. To have returned to this house. Have you ever seen my Aunt Micaela before? - Never, I swear. I didn't know her either, but I'm not the odd one. It's logical. You were in the garden and she was looking for burglars. Come, we'll heal your scratches. Leoncio, you go with Mariana and see that she goes to bed. Yes, ma'am. - And don't forget Edgardo's journey. With your permission, if you don't want me. We're reaching Villalba and it can't be helped. Business is business. - Go on. Chloroform Villalba, two minutes. With your permission, Sir. It's not possible! Help! Sir's not there! He's out of bed. It's not happened in ten years. I'm leaving tomorrow. Warn the others, we must look for him. And close the gate, so he doesn't escape. Yes, ma'am. But then I'm going. What a life! Let's take care of it. Fortunately it's nothing. Just a bandage. What's worse is your jacket. Take it off so it can be sewn. Thank you, Clotilde. - Go to the bathroom. The first door. You can tidy up. You're the most amazing woman in the world. That family of yours, are all quite extraordinary. - And yours. Perhaps mine too. Until later. There must be something. There must be something. I thought as much. What are you doing there? - Doing my job. I was told to keep an eye on Mariana and I was doing just that. You can clear off. Madame told me to stay. You go to the kitchen and help look for the Master who has got up. Got up? Then he'll have missed his train. They're alone in the study. "Juanita" Dark hair. Green eyes. Age uncertain. She came to me through an advertisement on April 12. I took her home the following day. I killed her the 3rd of May. She took half an hour to die. "Felisa" Fair hair. Blue eyes. Young. Didn't want to come with me. To manage it I had to resort to chloroform. Died instantly. At dawn. Thursday, appointment with Clotilde. What are you reading? Forgive me, but one has certain hobbies. Did you take a bottle out of here? A bottle? It was in this pocket. Ah, no, I gave it to Fernando. Sometimes one writes a bit of nonsense. Did you read any of it? The book fell to the floor... Worried about me? I'm not surprised. I was in my room. Good evening, Ojeda. - Good evening. Surprised that I've got up? - Not at all. Are you going along with me as if I was crazy? No, Ojeda? - Yes. No. - As you wish. I'll finish my repairs, I'll be right back. If I hadn't scared him, he wouldn't go. - What have you done? Poor fellow. Right now, I'm of sound mind. I would say I always have been if it weren't so difficult to believe. I need you to believe me. - I believe you, Edgardo. There's something in your eyes. I believe you. - Thank heavens. You saved me with your love in the most terrible moment, without wanting to. And I buried myself in bed without getting up. But only once. - Once? When another girl disappeared. - It's true, when Julia disappeared. Today is the second time I get up, because... I fell asleep and dreamed that it was happening again tonight with Mariana. Edgardo, your dream was true. Tonight Mariana planned to be with Ojeda's nephew. - His nephew? Where? Where is he taking her? To Ojeda's estate. But she didn't go, she repented. I sent a servant up to watch her. Even taking advantage of the interest I inspire in Ezekiel I thought to go tonight. I'll go tomorrow. You mustn't go. To Ojeda's estate. I discovered a tremendous thing. Ezequiel has killed women several there! No, you're crazy. you're crazy! No, and I know who he looks like. Landr? . And he's written about the dead women in his notebook. Nonsense, when that happens you don't write it down. Not at all. He's taken her! He's taken her already. Mariana! I saw a man. The one before has come back. I've not done with him from the other time because Mariana is Mariana. Explain now! Sir, I know nothing. - Speak or I swear...! Didn't they tell you to watch her? Yes, sir. But Ferm?n told me I had to replace him. What? - Forgive me, Mr. Ojeda demanded, then I saw Miss had fainted. What, fainted? - Yes! I went for the first aid box. That's a lie. Miss forbid him... Quiet! - What's the use of talking? We must save her. You must lead the way. No, I will not. - She's your daughter. They'll take her. To Ojeda's estate, I'm not going. No. Won't you go? To my bed. - Sainted aunt! I'll go. The only one in their right mind. I'll expound as he kills me, like Juanita, Felisa, all the rest... What a man! Since I've known he kills his conquests I feel an attraction towards him. Such rare attraction. Ferm?n, I'm going to bed. We've reached the heights of Escorial and when we get to Avila ask for the complaints book. Tonight the service is dreadful. Hold me, Leoncio. Hold me tight. Or I'll have a mind to go down on all fours. I've had enough. I'm going now. I can do no more. Watch out. At Venta de Banos expect the mail train from Galicia. What's the matter, Dimas? Have you forgotten how to open the door? Do you need anything, Sir? No, nothing. Bring some rum or brandy and then go to bed. Tonight you're no longer needed. Come on! Hurry! - Forgive me, Sir. The spirits, where are they? - What do you mean, where? Is it so long that you've forgotten the way to the pantry. In the pantry! Of course! Has anyone been here? - No, sir. Then why all this mess? I don't know, Sir. Perhaps cats. We've two tiny ones, skinny as the devil. Don't be silly! Do cats open suitcases? I don't know, maybe it was your uncle. - I don't know. It's possible. Every day I find his behaviour stranger than before. Already he's kidnapped her. "This goes well!" What is it? Where am I? Whose house is this? - Mariana, calm down. Fernando! What is this? How am I here? Forgive me, for having brought you against your will? I needed you so much... I realize I have done so too violently. I used the chloroform my uncle uses for his experiments. No, it's not that. It's not that which is so horrible. What's the matter? - Did you use chloroform? Yes, five or six drops in a handkerchief. That wouldn't produce hallucinations? - No. This house is yours? The property we talked about. Yes, the same. Then, if the chloroform doesn't produces hallucinations, why do I know this house? Why? What are you saying, Mariana? Watch what you say. If I've never been here, why these walls and this furniture are familiar? Are you sure? - Yes, I think so. I'm almost certain. That window, the staircase, the clock, the closet. All this I've seen before. - Mariana! Doesn't this go off twice before it turns itself on? How could you possibly know? - Each moment I remember more. This room, the garden, the corridor leading to a large, stone room. Uncle's laboratory? - Laboratory? I don't remember seeing it. I'm sure down here was a closet. I'm not sure where, but there was. - A closet? Do you know what I mean? A kind of wardrobe. Yes, there are such closets. If only there weren't. Come, Mariana. We need to talk. First things first. - What? - My life before I met you. Taxi! Taxi! Miss, Miss Clotilde! Where are you going? May I accompany you. I've just I left the house. I can't take it anymore. Fernando wants to take me into service. I'm going to his place. But if we don't find a taxi, we won't arrive till dawn. Continue. - I searched the whole house. Upstairs in the closet, I found the cause of my obsessions. A dress. - A dress? Yes, a dress for a masked ball. Come, I've got it here. It's incomplete. It lacks a sleeve and shawl. Along with the dress, I found a music box. Don't you remember anything? It's like mine. - And I found something else. Could this woman be you? - It really is me. Is this portrait me? - I don't know what to think. You didn't think it was me? - How could it be? How could it belong to a modern girl, a portrait that is so many years old. - Then... why bring me here? - I was convinced that someone in your family looking just like you was the woman my father committed suicide for. But for you to be the same woman in the portrait, shatters my assumptions. I don't know what to think. Now I'm the one who needs your help to awaken from this nightmare. Wait a minute. In a pavilion by the lake, I kept all my childhood things. Pictures, cards, gifts. Many things. Maybe you could clear things up. Good evening, Miss. Do you want something? Are you Fernando's servant? - Yes, Miss. Do you have the key to that closet? - Darned key. Three days I've been looking for it. Do you remember if there was a cupboard here? No, I don't remember. - Next to the stairs perhaps? That's it, on the wall. - We can soon find out. It sounds hollow. - I wasn't wrong. It had a spring. That's it. Pull now. That's it. - What's inside? Shoes. For the dress. - And a sleeve. The missing one! Bring the dress over there, hurry. The shawl! Knife! A bloodstained knife. - No! Everything is stained with blood. - Give me the dress. The Master's room is upstairs on the left? Yes, Miss. What will you do? Be careful. I'm afraid. The other day he was in the garden burying something. Don't say I'm going up. I was sick and went to the dining room for a drink. Yes, Miss. What is it? Where have you been like that? Like a peddler. Don't worry. If you knew what I have here... And Miss? - Not feeling well. In the dining room, for some tea. I'll go serve it. It seems all went well. - Well wrong. Since Mariana arrived I'm more confused about my father. You'll never sort it. I'll go to the lab. Don't disturb me. Do you know if there was a cupboard? Uncle, the cupboard. It was there, they opened it! It's empty. - No, here. A dry leaf. Almost reduced to dust. I'll look under the microscope in my lab. I'll come too. - No! - Why not? Come up, but whatever you see don't tell anyone. I promise, Uncle. Uncle, come on. It's the first time that a layman has set foot in here. Whatever you see, not a word. Swear! - Never mind, let's see. Patience, let me drop this sack. Leoncio! - Sir. We'll shortly arrive in Avila. The complaints book? I'll hear the station master. I'm going to get dressed and go down. Ask Ferm?n for the key to the cabinet. He has it. Ferm?n has left, sir. - Never mind the coach. Look for him. Go! I'll leave him alone, as I found him. Finally. Night's arriving! That boat ride was no joke. Knock again! It's like a haunted house. - Right. I seem to hear steps. Is this the house of Ojeda? - Yes, ma'am. Come in. What... is it? Come in? There... Yes, ma'am. Don't believe the lady. Aunt Clotilde, don't be afraid. - Mariana! What joy! You're still alive? Nothing happened to you? Some things happened, but nothing serious yet. - Yet? Yet. Ferm?n has come to work for Ojeda. He says he'll go mad at home. Poor thing. Out of the frying pan into the fire. Come lad. Ferm?n, do you like the look your new home? I don't know. Let me tell you, I'm not one for surprises. Outside the house is suspicious, but here one can breathe easily and relax. Ferm?n, follow that man, hurry. Quiet, they can hear us. There's someone in the closet. You're joking? - Follow him, quick. Forgive me ma'am, but I'm in the wrong house. Explain, Mariana. Do you know what's happening? I trying to learn, but it must be horrible from what I've discovered. Speak, then it's my turn. Here they murdered a woman. Here there's no way out. All I've found is bloodstained. I think the mystery is Fernando himself. The uncle, Mariana, the uncle. The servant told me Fernando buried something in the garden. Trifles! That's nothing. - What do you know? That dead and buried is not a woman, but several. What's that? - Landr? is not Fernando, but the other. The fungus and beard. - Ezequiel? There. They are almond leaves. - Almond? I'm on the right track. Let's go to the garden. We're locked in. Locked in? Dimas! In his notebook, he lists the victims. How brazen. There's Juanita, Felisa and who knows how many more. He even notes the time it took to die! How frightful. How frightful. After knowing what I do, I don't hate Fernando. God forgive me. But I feel... I now have more interest. We're both raving mad. The same is happening to me. Aunt Clotilde! - I'm a Briones like you. Why are you here! I told you to stick with the servant. I locked him in the pantry. Here's the key. With your permission, I'll let him out, so his absence won't be noticed. Come in. What? He's got up. Good evening. - It's Leoncio! Where have you been? - In the garden. Collecting the tools. Do you want something? - Nothing., You can go. You're a fool. I told you not to lose sight of that man and you let him go. I can't explain it. - And why are you here? For Ferm?n to give me the keys to the wardrobe. On arrival at Avila, Sir has insisted on dressing. Give him the keys and leave. -Yes, Miss. I've an idea. Tonight will appear the woman from Fernando's portrait. If he killed her, he can't resist her presence. - Really? How can that be? In an upstairs bedroom, I have an empire dress of the woman in the portrait. One sleeve is detached, pin it for me and wait. It's the door on the left. I have to stay here a while. - Why? I've noticed that when I'm alone, the closet opens. One can't deny you're a Briones. Completely Briones. Don't leave me alone on the train. Already? What, already? Where we go, who knows the difference between truth and lies. Come on. Don't leave me alone on the road. I am committed to Master Fernando. Here stranger things happen than in the Briones house. Quiet... And keep down. I'm not drunk, but I see double. - Same with me. Let's go. I can't walk. - Me neither, I'm rooted to the spot. I'm nailed to the floor. Push me. Silence, the closet will open. Do you realise? She thinks the closet will open. And will open itself. Sainted aunt! We never had this at the Briones. Mariana! - Julia. What's this? - It's her sister. She disappeared three years ago. What are you doing here? - Surprised to see me? Of course. - Coming out of a closet is rather unusual. And after three years... I've looked everywhere. Imagine, you were in this closet. Why did you leave? - Do you want to know? I'll tell you? Come on. - I couldn't put up with so much disturbance. She was the craziest of them all! I was so much in love. Know with who? De Perea. And one day I said: "We've come so far." Of course, we got married? Yes, yes. We got married. - They didn't marry. We've a cute little house at La Prosperidad. He doesn't like it, but I say put up with it. And he does. - Yes, they have married. Julia, quiet, for all you hold dear. - My Luisote. - For him I beg you. Relax, speak normally. I need to know what you were doing. Why I came? For Luisote. He's here working. He's a policeman. I just told you. - You didn't tell me anything. Come, let's talk elsewhere. - Isn't there something about this house? I swear I've seen this house before. Me too. Look, the wardrobe and the wardrobe sister. Whatever. I'm off. I'd rather ring the bell of Medina del Campo. Wait, once I've seen the master, I'll leave with you. Luisete had gone for three days and I couldn't be without him. I discovered he was in service here and came to see him. Secretly we ate and as I was leaving, you arrived with the owner of the house. Luisote hid me in the closet. What joy and happiness to see you in my arms! What is your husband doing here? - Don't be silly! Luisote is a police officer. I said that. He's come to solve a crime. He thinks a murdered woman is buried on the premises. - What? They received a letter denouncing the crime, that took place years ago. Luisote tells me nothing. He says I have a screw loose. Imagine, me. Continue with what you were told. Luisote will know tomorrow where the woman is buried. He'll bring a police dog and thanks to the dog... Thanks to the dog. It won't be tomorrow. It will be tonight. Leoncio! Leoncio! Leoncio! Miss. Go home for my aunt Micaela's dogs. Use Fernando's car. Yes, Miss. I'm scared stiff. - And I'm a walking refrigerator. I prefer the train from the other place. - That train, why not. I carry out the orders. I'll go for the dogs. This way, there's a service door. Don't exert yourself, they'll open it! I'm not wasting my time. If I knew the world... They don't need to open it, I'll do it myself. Now! Come On! - Wait. The reaction's taking place! - I can't wait. Yes, yes. I am a genius of my species. Almond leaves. Talking to myself. Ferm?n! Who locked us in? Why didn't you respond to my calls. I know nothing. Here terrible things occur. Come to the garden. We'll get the pick-axes. You'll help me dig. Dig? At this hour? - Yes, under the almond trees. Girl, you're gorgeous! - Fernando won't be able to resist. To uncover Ezequiel, I'd have to be a quick change artist He has killed so many. - Stop your fooling. Go to the hall and tell me when Fernando arrives. We'll stay here. As you say. If I don't come up, shout down. Dimas, Dimas! - Do you need me for something? Go up and keep watch, you know. With care. - Yes, sir. I'll check exactly with my watch the time it takes... understand? The time it takes to die. What's that? Excuse me, I hadn't realized. Sorry. What did that man say? - Blabbering old fool. From you I should have no secrets. It's an old story that gnaws at my insides. And I'll free it, Clotilde. Will you tell me about Juanita, Felisa and so many others? Is it true? Rascal, I always thought you'd read something. Well, yes. It is true. Is it possible? You declare it with satisfaction? - And with pride. The day the world will know, humanity will not easily forget my name. - That's where it takes you... Vanity. - Yes, everyone has vanity, for good and evil. We have this secret half. It gives me a certain pleasure, which is hidden in us all, including you. They won't say now I was crazy. And not go to jail? - Don't be misled. In this business, professionals shoot to kill those who are only amateurs. But professionals will go to jail. - Rarely. They must do evil for that. And Landr? ? He was a vulgar murderer that has nothing to do with it. Landr? was just like you. - It seems, I've been told so. Sir. - What is it? That is, well... Speak without fear, tell us everything. Dead? Yes, sir. At nine minutes. No resistance. You know. And now skin her. Take great care. Yes, sir. - No, not that. I won't allow it! - Clotilde, calm down. What is it? Dimas! But didn't you just go upstairs? Don't worry. - Sir. Let me introduce and unmask once and for all. Clotilde Briones, Luis Perea, policeman. I am honoured, ma'am. Hurry, man hurry! - I'm scared. I don't want to find what I'm looking for. What are you doing? - What you should have done. Mariana asked the dogs and I'm going for her. Only for her. To the Ojeda house, no. You'll be sorry. I'm going to save her! Come on! - No, Micaela, the home of Ojeda, no. I don't understand, I don't understand. Then who is Dimas? - Dimas is upstairs. This is Mr. Perea. To work more easily, he spent a few days disguised as Dimas. Because of a letter I sent to the police. He himself locked up Fernando and I so he could act more freely. Ah, you're a nursemaid. I'm agent Perea and I'm investigating the request of Mr. Ojeda, regarding the murdered woman. It was exactly what I intended to speak to you about. You've called the police to uncover the murder of a woman here? Yes. - What a nerve! Of course, she wouldn't be killed by you. - No, as if I killed her? I was about to commit a similar atrocity. What's that? - Don't forget she's a Briones. Clotilde Briones. - Now I understand. Whoever killed this woman must have been Fernando. What! - It can't be otherwise. No surprise it'll be him in his suit. It's a real shame. Otherwise she's a very attractive woman. There they are, the boats! Quiet, woman. Don't torment me. It's best we return home. No, no. You've forgotten your daughter? This home? Why did we come to this house? You see it, you're excited. We shouldn't enter. Come on, Micaela. - No. Let me go! I want to stay, to live here as before. - Can you explain what she's saying? What does she mean? - Don't say anything. She's delirious, she's sick and doesn't know what she's saying I've reason to believe she's not delirious. - I have reason to believe so too. What business is it of yours, Dimas? - I'm not Dimas, sir. I'm a police officer. - Do you understand? - Not at all. How do you know Dimas? Answer! How do you know him? It's no secret, I've lived in this house. I rented it some time ago. Rented it from the father of this man. Is this true? - Yes. While you were studying in Belgium. I knew you kept something from me, Uncle. Why Mariana knew this house. - Why my wife knew. Who is your wife? - Julia Briones, sir. Are you mad? What are you saying? My daughter Julia... Now you will see. Ferm?n, my heart. You must be right. They're searching for her in the closet. Julia! Where are you? What is it? Daddy! What a surprise! I bet you didn't expect to meet me here tonight? And Aunt Micaela. What a laugh! Auntie! Child! Where have you been all these days? These days? How hilarious! Quiet! Eloisa! It's not Eloisa! It's Mariana. She looks like her. No, it's her. Forgive me. Aunt Micaela! Ferm?n! Take her! - Yes, Sir. It's Eloisa. It's Eloisa. She's calling my mum? - Yes, your mother. Here's the knife found near the dress. Who killed her? Her or you? She, she. - Poor Mum. Explain yourself. Was she crazy then or because of the crime? She was already, she always was. I swore to my parents to watch over her and never lock her away. Then the girls were small. We lived here. Some evenings we visited the owner of the house, Federico Ojeda, with whom we had an old friendship, Eloisa and I. The obsession of Micaela was that between those two noble beings, existed guilty behaviour. And one night, we were invited to a formal party and out in the garden, we arrived after Micaela and without having time to avoid it... Before dawn, to leave it all with impunity... we buried Eloisa under the almond trees where she used to sit and embroider and where one afternoon I had painted her portrait. This one? This one. I hid the knife and her favourite music box. I hid the bloodstained clothes and left the house with the girls. Ojeda never knew the truth, but always suspected. Within a year he died. That there was never a shadow of guilt, I'm sure. That he loved her, too. Tomorrow I will present my report. What will you say? - That there was no murdered woman. But the patient must be locked away. Luisote, You are the most handsome man in the world. Don't complain, Perea. I've put in your hands all that's needed to clarify it. Have you discovered everything or must I act? Everything is explained and fortunately nothing to condemn. How nothing to condemn? This is fixed, but there's more, much more. There more? - Yes, what about Juanita, Felisa, and the others. More to uncover, Landr? . But Clotilde, Clotilde! Keep my secret a few days more! They're tom cats that you kill? - No, they're she cats. And thanks to my experiments I'll end with... What would you have me kill? And these cats are skinned? Naturally. Cat-skinner! Fernando. What are you doing? Why did you flee? Tonight I came here to dig to find the remains... Don't, please. - I'm sorry. I never thought Eloisa could be your mother. Knowing it I fled and came to bury the tragedy of this house. How I've suffered in these few hours. - Me too. But someday we will bless this suffering. Because from it can be born our happiness.
