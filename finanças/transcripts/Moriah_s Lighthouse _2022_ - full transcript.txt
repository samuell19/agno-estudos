This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. Salut, Maurice. Ah, Moriah, comment ça va? Tres bien. Attend. I have something for you. Ah, my favorite. Mm. And what is the occasion today? Flowers are best given when there is no occasion. Enjoy. Merci. Give Katherine my love. Oui. Bonjour, Regis. Bonjour, Moriah. Both: Merci. - A tout. - A tout. I'm not supposed to say this, but, umm, I think you're my favorite. Brigitte! Oui. Yes, it's finished. Uh, yeah, how does 3:00 PM sound? Super. Okay, I'll see you then! Bye. Both: Bonjour. I'm trying to find my hotel. Castle Beau Site. Vous cherchez un château? Yes. A castle. Uh-huh. Gauche. Yes. O-Okay, thank you. Uh, what do you call that? Baguette. Baguette, same in English. Une? Two. Merci. Oh. Magnifique, Leon! Comme toujours. Are you crazy?! Me?! You're the one daydreaming in the middle of the road! You're the one biking like a maniac! In France, bicycles have the right of way. You could have killed me! Ignoring the fact that I'm the one lying in he middle of the road. Ow. Ooh. Are you actually hurt? Nothing's is broken? I'm okay, but my lunch has seen better days. Probably my fault. I was walking with my face in a map. Okay, well, just um, next time watch where you are walking. Bonjour, Moriah! Salut, Jacques. Lavender? Yes, it's beautiful, no? Would you like some? It makes me sneeze. Very lovely though. From a friend, or... From a very nice man in town with a smile as bright as the sun. They're from Maurice. It's a gift from Maurice. Okay. Oh, this is from the post. It goes to reception, if you please, kind sir. Anything for you. Well, and for the inn. And for you, as well. But mainly for the inn. Entirely so. Ah, merci. Perfect timing. Would you mind helping with these? I'm donating them to the Emmaüs. Oui. Merci, Jacques. Katherine, he's like my brother. I know, but he's very sweet. One day you might consider thinking differently about him. There are worse things than finding a man who looks at you the way he does. I went by the lighthouse this morning. I'm still finding trash everywhere. And the day you buy it, you can put a big long fence around it warning people to keep out permanently. I'm teasing. I know you're going to share it for all the world to see. Listen, I know you hate when I offer, but... It's important that I find the money myself. Thank you though. I'm not far off. I just have to sell maybe two, 300 more end tables. Monsieur! Have you been in a collision? As a matter of fact I have. With her! Um, come and get cleaned up. I'm just thankful no one was seriously hurt. They way you ride around on that bicycle, it's a wonder it doesn't happen more often. Moi?! I'm not the one to blame. - He's the one that... - There he is. Nice and clean. Fresh as a daisy. Good as new. Okay. Thank you for the shower. I was wondering if you have a laundry room? Ah, yes, just through there. Did we get a name? Uh, Ben McCain. Actually, maybe you can help me. I'm looking for a castle? Castle Beau Site? Of course. Mr. McCain. I recall your reservation. We have you for two months. I am Katherine Beaufort, the owner of Castle Beau Site, Ah, Beau Site. And this is Moriah, my niece. Please forgive me, I have some business to attend to. Moriah, darling, would you please take Mr. McCain over and get him checked in? But it's just right there. Pleasure meeting you, Mr. McCain. Make yourself at home. We are at your service, day and night. Thank you. Where are the rest of your bags? Oh, this is it. You're staying the entire summer, that's all you brought? I got packing down to a science. No bags means no hassle. So, you can take it from here? Wow. This is... This is gorgeous. Locally built? Yes, in fact. The guy who made this is very good. Look at this inlay, and the veneers are perfectly matched. This chamfered leg. Yes, I know. The guy who made it, she's me. Oh! Seriously? I'm sorry, I thought you worked at the- No, I have a workshop in town. I work for me. Well, you have some real skill. I'm very impressed. Merci. When you live on a small island, if you need something built or repaired, and, well, if you or your neighbor can't do it, then you're... You're out of luck. So, we all grow up loving to learn new things. That's why I'm always bouncing around. I love meeting new people, seeing how they live, seeing their world. Life should be an adventure. Hm. Well, if you don't need anything else... No, I'm good, thank you. Okay. Julie will check you in. I love it. Really? Yeah, it's amazing. It matches the counters perfectly. You're amazing. Merci. Okay, I'm almost finished with the second one, and I'll have them bring it by tomorrow. Perfect, perfect. Do you know the most common question I get from customers? How much candy can I take through customs? I do get that one a lot, but no. Everyone always asks me, "Who did this incredible woodwork?" - Ah. - "Give me his name!" And I tell them it's all done by a very talented, local artist and woodsmith, philosopher and problem-solver. A true Renaissance woman. Wow. It doesn't say any of that on the card, just my name and number. And she's humble. That's why we love her. Look, I know how many hours this took, and I want to say that I still haven't given up hope that one day you'll take some time off so we can drive up the coast, or go to Paris. I know you think I work too much. You work too much. I understand. You're saving your pennies. All of them. All I'm saying here is if the invitation for adventure should fall at your feet, take it. You never hear someone fondly recall, "Remember when I worked all day, so exhausted that my days off were spent sleeping and doing laundry?" I'll keep it in mind. So, this is the basic idea, and then these frames here, they are already built, and then once it's assembled the we can add whatever decorative elements we want. That's already more than I could have hoped for. I love what you have done with the curved timbers. This man looks very lost. Oh, Mr. McCain! Oh. Really? You know this man? - Of course. - No, he's... Bonjour again. I was actually looking for a place to eat, but everywhere I go, they only speak French so I just leave. The only words I know are bonjour and adieu. Oh, hello and goodbye forever? Yeah, now I see why you go in and out of these places. Back at the hotel, the restaurant inside have menus both with English and French, Thank you. Oh, these are beautiful. Are you getting married? You must be the lucky man! We're not getting married. Yet. Ah. No, the fact is that we have so many requests for weddings by the sea, and Moriah has kindly designed this lovely arbor for me. I actually do a little design myself. Really? Houses mostly. That's what brought me to France. You're building here on the island? Yes, in fact we start tomorrow. But I won't bother you anymore. Thank you for the recommendation, and bon soir. That's "evening." Ah. Bon voyage? That's "have a good trip." Huh. Bon Jovi? You're halfway there. That was funny. - Bye-bye. - Bye. He's different. Yes, handsome and charming with no baggage. I don't trust him. Yes! Oh. Oh, that's not good. There are signs everywhere! Do not overload. It's simple enough for a child to understand! Maybe we should put a diagram next to the signs for people who don't want to read them. Who would choose not to read them? Ben. Bonjour! Good morning. Another beautiful day. We were just talking about the power issue last night. Yes, yes. The power went out on my floor. It's, oof, wild. You were not disturbed, I hope. Nope, nope. I was... I was out like a light. A play on words. Very charming. If you'll excuse me, I must check in with the electrician to assess the damage we have suffered. Bonjour et adieu. Merci, Jacques. I get the impression he doesn't like me very much. He's a little irritated. He did spend the morning fielding complaints from angry guests and disposing of melted refrigerator contents. Well, I, uh, I hope he finds the culprit. Oh, they will be caught. People go to prison for this in France. Seriously? Oui. Uh, you know that there's an app, right, that can translate French for you? So if you don't know what someone is saying, or what a sign means. Right, because I don't know what any of it means. Mm. Hey, do you have any recommendations for things I can do today? Uh, you could take a walk or ride a bicycle? Just stay away from the electrical circuits. The prison thing wasn't very funny! It was. Bike tour? - Ah. Okay. - Merci. Nice day for a little jaunt around the island. Awesome! Should be fun. Okay. Allons-y! Got some real athletes here. Here I come. Okay. Okay. The brochure said tour of France, not Tour De France. Any chance we can get a water break?! No? I can't thank you enough. If I had the money, I'd have you outfit the entire shop. If you had the money, I would let you. I do have one other small project I'd love to discuss when you have time. I know you have much bigger pursuits. Are you getting any closer? Ah, the lighthouse? Bit by bit, but honestly, if I don't uncover buried treasure, I think it's going to be at least another year until I have enough money. If you need help digging? Keep at it. Your parents would be very proud. Un moment. Ben? Oh, Moriah. I was out for a walk like you suggested. I found this bike. A walk? With a helmet? Yup. And then, there it was. A sheep? Yeah, it was a sheep. It was like a sheep attack. I was cruising along with the group, you know, enjoying the tour, keeping up no problem, and a sheep, it just jumped out right in front of me! Bam! Like a stick-up? Did it take your wallet? You know, I could have actually been seriously injured. Mm-hm. No, it's... It's very serious. It's very serious, because the sheep here, they have become quite brazen. We can't leave keys in our cars, because you turn your back for one minute and zoom! They're off to the casino! Very funny. I'm glad you're enjoying laughing at... Very... Yeah. I'm just so happy you are safe. I have to go to my studio for a moment, but, if you want, after that I can walk you back to the inn. Thank you. Casino. Wow. This is an impressive setup. Thank you. Most of those tools are my grandfather's, but over the years I've added to the collection. He was a carpenter by trade? He was. A master. He always said that working with wood was life's most intimate connection with nature. He was the kind of man that if you give him a chisel or a piece of wood, he could make you anything. Well, obviously, you inherited his gene. Apparently, when I was seven, for my birthday I asked for a length of rosewood so I could make something beautiful. Lumber is expensive here, yeah? Yes, if you can even get it, but wood has a beauty some people are still willing to pay for. Wow. You must have people lined up around the block. Yes and no. I'm... I'm particular about the projects that I choose. You know, I want every piece to be meaningful, to speak to my heart. Oh, that sounds a little silly now that I... No, no. I get it. I'm the same way. Can I see your outdoor space? Uh, yes. Ah. From the sketches. For weddings. Mm-hm. The woman who can build anything. Bonjour, Moriah! Bonjour, Micheline! Well, I'll just go lock up and we can walk back to the inn. Ready? Ready as a rabbit. Is that an American saying? No, that is something I just came up with and wish I hadn't. Merci. Ah, Moriah! This is my lucky day. Salut, Maurice! And who is this handsome man? Don't tell me you got married secretly and did not invite me to the wedding. No, and if I had been, surely I would have invited you. Maurice. Sometimes called I'homme aux fleurs. The flower man. At your service. Ben McCain. Pleasure to meet you. Maurice, do you know a good place to eat around here? My friend, this is France. There is no bad place to eat around here. Now, both of you hop in. I will take you. Oh, no, because I have to go... Oh, you are not going to let him eat alone? Surely not. Wow, look at that stone. It's beautiful. Um... Why don't you order for the both of us? Surprise me. Allors, une douzen huîtres fines de Clair yves papin, praires et palourdes, em... Oui, ça va. Pour deux, s'il vous plaît. Ah, and, to begin, um... Bulots. Tres bien. Thank you. Merci. Merci. So, is your family from here? Yes, as far back as we can trace on both sides. My mother's family opened the inn in the 1920s, first as a boarding house, and my father's family were keepers of the lighthouse. The lighthouse. I saw that today on my ride. Wow, you really have stayed local. And this is your first time in France? Oui. What gave me away? I like to come early. You know, meet the locals, learn things the French way. Ah, and tell me, what have you learned? I've learned that everybody is very happy, that they really seem to know how to enjoy themselves. And the food. The food is incredible. I had three baguettes today alone. Okay. Lesson number one. Quality over quantity. Maybe one incredible baguette enjoyed is enough? And lesson number two? Why don't you try lesson number one? Ah. Both: Merci. Okay. So, what are we eating? Uh, les yeux du calamar. Oh, calamari. Yes, the eyeball. O-oh. No. It's... It's sea snail. Ah. Snails. Okay. Bon appetit. Bon appetit. Okay. It's pretty stuck in there. Tape recording: Bonjour. Bonjour. Tape recording: Sil te plait! Sil te plait! Tape recording: Sil te plait! Sil te plait! Merci beaucoup. Bon soir. Bon soir, monsieur. Voulez-vous boire quelque chose? Something to drink? Ah, yes. Um... Try If you enjoy cider, it's very similar. Tart, but refreshing. Deux. S'il te plaît. Oh, very good. Well, this is quite a little slice of paradise you found here. Yes, you're right. You're enjoying your time so far? Oh, yes, very much. In fact, I made it into town this morning. I got to see Moriah's studio. She invited you? Uh, well, not exactly. I had another bike incident Oh. Merci. She really is something, and her work is... Extraordinary. Her father's family were all very talented. Her grandfather especially. When Moriah's parents passed, she stuck to him like glue. Oh, her parents. I... I had no idea. It was when she was quite little. Home for you is? Mm. That is a good question. I bounce so much for work I'm not sure I really know anymore. Is that typical for an architect? Well, for the kind of work I do, yes, but it's also a choice. I like not knowing what the next chapter holds. A man who designs homes, and doesn't have one to call his own. I suppose I haven't found a place where the desire to stay is as strong as the desire to move on. You remind me very much of someone I used to know. I had a nice chat with our American guest. He spoke very highly about your work, and how much he enjoyed the lunch you had together. I know what you're thinking. I'm thinking nothing, but he is here for the whole summer. And? He's quite charming and not at all disturbing on the eyes. And? You both have common interests. An appreciation for design. And? Perhaps, should the occasion arise, it might be not so terrible to get to know him a little better. Okay. Tantine. The last thing in the world that I'm looking for is romance. That's exactly when you find it. I don't date tourists! J'taime, Tantine. Love you. Tantine. Is Jacques nearby? Oh. He's back around lunch, I believe. Is it urgent? Uh, I'm having some pieces of the arbor delivered today, and I was hoping he could help carry them. Ah, he'll be very disappointed to have missed the occasion, but perhaps someone else could be of help? Ben? Hi. Well, I think these are the last ones. Can I give you a hand putting them together? Uh, no, thank you. Wouldn't want to ruin your plans for the morning. I don't any plans. No more bicycle tours? You're right, I haven't had the best luck with bicycles on this trip so far. I was hoping to make it one day without getting injured. For you, that could be tough. Okay. Merci. Thank you. Ah, you're welcome. Quesque'il fait? Ben! Quesque tu fais? What are you doing? I was just going to go out on the boat. - In that? - Yeah. You know that's not a boat, right? You take that to your boat. Ah. Yeah, and have you checked the tide schedule? Because if you don't time it properly you could be stranded in the bay. I'll be back in an hour tops. If you come back at all. Uh, where are you planning to go? I'd just go out in the bay, maybe go around, get a better look at the lighthouse. Ah, le phare. Ben: I find architecture is often viewed as a technical skill, but I've always considered form to be an equal, if not greater, counterpart to function, and form comes directly from the heart. The lighthouse, for example. It exists solely for the purpose of function, yet every lighthouse is different. Why? Because every one carries a piece of the designer's heart. You're very, um... Inattendu. Inattendu. Caught me without my translator, so I'm going to assume that means "pleasant to stroll along a path with." The traveling architect whose entire life fits into a single bag. What else do you need? Family. You need family, no? Without family we have no history, no roots. We are floating on the wind. Doesn't sound so bad to me. And this is why you travel? I travel because it's what I know, but I also love my work. I love creating something out of nothing, I love taking the old and making it new. Ah. I love taking the old and keeping it old. Every grain of wood, every nail, every fleck of paint it has a a story to tell, a history, um, a piece of the designer's heart. So, the lighthouse was rebuilt? Yes, in 1946 after it was destroyed during the war. And you're planning on buying it? The lighthouse? No. In France they're owned by the government, but the light keeper's house can be purchased. My father's family has lived in that house since the day it was built. One day I plan to restore every last inch of it. The light keeper's house? Uh, Moriah, hold up... Monsieur, monsieur! C'est une propriete privee! It's private property! I know it's private property. No need to shout. - Benjamin, hello. - Nicholas, hello! Wait, you know this man? Nicholas Martin. Moriah Beaufort. Enchantée. Mr. McCain is quite the brilliant architect. Have you seen the design he's dreamt up for this place? Quel endroit? What place? This place. The site of my new home. Moriah, I think there's been a serious miscommunication... Seems pretty straight forward to me. I was hired to design a house. I had no idea whose land it was on. You haven't been hired to design a house, you've been hired to tear one down. Mine, my family's. I think that if you saw my plans... I don't need to look at your plans. You just told me exactly how you operate. Out with the old. Is that not true? With the house, yes, but we're not going to touch the lighthouse. The house and the lighthouse are one and the same. How can you not see that? How can you not... Why bother? I know your feelings about history. You're the last person who would understand. Moriah! Did you know? About what? About the house! That it's been bought by an investor and he's planning to demolish it! Slow down, Moriah. I don't have a clue what are you talking about. What investor? What house? The light keeper's house. That's why Ben is here, he's been hired to design the project. They're going to tear it down and build a private residence. Moriah, of course I didn't know. But who is this investor? This man? Entre. Hello, Katherine. Nicholas? Am I the only one who doesn't know this man? I'm confused. You bought the house? It was time to come home. It's been 30 years. Without warning, without as much as a word? Look, I feel badly if I've stepped on anyone's plans, but I assure you... I think you should go. Katherine. Nicholas. Please. Just like that, I've become the villain. I'm not sure that's true. Two people chasing the same dream. That doesn't make you a bad guy. I fear it may be a little more complicated than that. Both: Merci. You know, this island is very special to me. I grew up here. I fell in love for the first time here. It's the only place that's ever truly felt like home. I think I wanted that feeling again, you know? In the end it's never just the place that brings you back. It's the people. Always the people. He had this quality, this confidence, like a movie star. He was quite serious, adventurous. When we met he was in the military, he wanted to study medicine in America. He was always reading. I fell for him in an instant. Is that why he left? To study? The war in the Gulf. France sent soldiers to fight alongside the Americans. And then what? He just... Well, he never came back? He never returned? It wasn't so simple. It was just after... Ah. After my parents died. You were so little. A teeny bird with a broken wing. This was your home. You needed to stay here to heal, to feel safe and grow. Nicholas wanted to see the world, but he was a good man. If he'd known the truth, he would have returned to make a life with me. I believed in my heart he would wake up one day and resent me for it. So, you gave him up for me? No, my darling. You were my greatest gift. I gave him up for him. I'm so sorry for your lighthouse. Mr. McCain, a pleasant evening I hope? Not the best, actually. Ah, bonjour, Maurice! Bonjour, again. Ah, I was wondering if I could try... Épuisé. Sold. Sold? Sold out? Épuisé. Désolé pour ça. Okay. Brigitte: Is there any hope? I don't know what we can do. Bonjour. I should be getting back. Good day. Hello. May I... Mm. Yes, of course. Look, I feel terrible about how things went down. I did not set out to ruin people's lives. Suddenly I feel like public enemy number one. You have to understand, the people in this town, we're family. Lesson number two. The people in your life are everything. And when one of us hurts, we all do. I thought maybe I would find you here. You're not planning on bashing me over the head with that are you? And waste good cider? No, I would drink it first. Merci. About lesson number two, um... You were unfairly thrust into the middle of all of this and I know you were just doing your job. It definitely wasn't personal. These things are always personal to someone. But it's not fair for you to shoulder the blame. You're right, I don't know you, and if I characterized you unfairly... Suis desole. I'm sorry. Well, if you're interested, Maybe you can show me through your eyes. From the day of its completion, my father's family, the Beauforts, were the sole keepers of the lighthouse. During both World Wars, while the men were off fighting, the women, they stood by it to make sure the light stayed on. My father was raised in this house. Why was it sold off? My family never owned it. The residence was afforded to the lighthouse keeper for the term of their service, but the property always belonged to the government. Once it was decommissioned it became my father's dream to one save enough money to buy it, but... I'm sure your plans are very nice, but this property tells the story of my family for generations. My father was born here. If it's torn down, I... It's all I have left of them. Katherine. Nicholas, please. I don't know what your hope is, but... My hope is nothing. This is my home. I've always planned to return. My intention was not to reopen old wounds. And yet here you are. Why didn't you tell me about Moriah all those years ago? You just stopped responding, silence, like I was nothing. I would have come back. And then what? I knew what you wanted. You would have lasted a year before getting restless. You had big dreams you wanted to pursue. But I didn't get to. I didn't get to pursue them, because all those dreams included you. The torment you put me through, wondering where I went wrong. If you had fallen in love with someone else. I'm sorry. Nicholas! Benjamin! I was hoping to find you. And I you. I had a thought. As did I! Does it involve the lighthouse? It involves a woman. Oh, um... Should we walk and talk? We should probably sit and drink. Come on. So, tell me. Uh, you go first. And then what? And then I rushed away. I didn't know what to say. Okay. I'm telling you, because... ...maybe I'm supposed to feel angry at him about the lighthouse, but what I'm really feeling... ...is more complicated. Ah. It's taken me a lifetime to realize that things rarely work out as planned, but... ...we can choose how to move forward. We can still shape the pages, even if we didn't write the narrative. I've been angry at the world for a long time. About a lot of things. I don't want to be angry anymore. Moriah? I don't need a translator to know that those are not words of encouragement. It's the, you know, the vintage flat head screws. It won't go in the hinge. May I? I'll just hold it. Merci. So. You know, there are a lot of stubborn ones. It's the stubborn ones that make life interesting. I talked to Nicholas today. His intention was to only ever live in the place he loves the most, surrounded by the people he loves the most. He wants to keep the house. To restore it. But he wants you to oversee the project. Me? You. You have the skill and you're the only person who will make sure that it is done properly, but we have to start in a week. No. No, way. I don't think that I can... Moriah, I understand that this is disappointing, it's not what I had in mind either. I spent a year working on those plans and, frankly, I'm pretty proud of them, but you know and I know that leveling that house is not the right thing to do. We have an opportunity to turn your vision into a reality. So, don't... Don't so it for me, don't do it for Nicholas. Do it for yourself. If you say no, I understand. But, please, we could use your help. Okay. For me. I'll do it for me. Great. I'll start making preparations. As some of you already know, this is a monumental moment for me, and I'm so honored to be working alongside each of you. Above all, the aim is to preserve. Please, let's be surgical in our approach whenever possible. I ask that you use the same care that you would if this was your home. And also have fun please. What? Nothing. Let's see what we're dealing with. Oui. Well, it smells like a locker room. Oh, it's just musk. Don't breath it in. Well, I'm smelling it, so that would suggest I'm breathing it. Well, um, stop breathing. Ah, you'd miss me way too much. You know it's in remarkably good shape considering the age. That tapered casement around the flue, it's a work of art. Oui. My grandfather, he did all the mill work. The casing, the moldings, the, uh, corbels here. Was there water damage in here at some point? It's possible. Looks like the molding around the window is rotted out at the bottom. Do you think you could mill some new stuff? It's a big job. We could always blow this window out and put in a double-glazed casement window. I'll throw you through a double-glazed casement window. Ah, oui. Super. Ben: Moriah! I think I found something! What? Looks like there's an opening back there. What? What in the world? Yeah, I tried to move it, but it's... it's not budging. Did you get in a lot of fights as a kid? No, the other children were afraid of me. Shall we? What's this? They are old letters. Oh. Katherine. I recall how much you loved to cook. So, I brought you these, fresh from the market. Thank you. I haven't thanked you yet for altering your plans with the lighthouse. It means so much to Moriah and to me. To everybody. Seeing as we're going to be neighbors, I wanted to extend an olive branch. So, now I did. Thank you. You know, it's really thoughtful, but the whole joy of cooking is in having someone to share it with. There were always whispers of my family sheltering allies during the war, but this is... Well, look at these dates. 1943, 44. So during the war. Yes, and they're all love letters, all written in the same hand. My love, my love, mon trésor, my darling JP, mon chér JP. "Mon chér, JP, I think of you often. I long for your breath on my cheek. I will write again when it is safe. Tout mon amour. All my love." It's signed, A. So, this JP must have also sheltered there for a time. Oui. Imagine falling so madly in love and then being torn apart. Never knowing when the next letter will arrive or where the person even is. It's unbearable. And spending months on end alone in that tiny room, alone with your thoughts, your worry. It makes you appreciate all the things we take for granted. I would really like to share these letters with Katherine, would you like to... Oh, oui. Yes. I'd love to. Okay. Oh, Moriah! I lost track of time. I invited Nicholas to use the kitchen and... And I made enough to feed the entire town. Why don't you stay? A meal is meant to be shared. Okay. Oui, merci. It looks very nice. Both: Thank you. Filet de morue aux pet its légumes de saison. A famous local dish. Nicholas does it magnificently. And I found these beautiful vegetables at the farmers market. So, why don't you help us to dress the table? Of course. I'm impressed you made this all from scratch. Meal is serious business around here, and preparation is half of the joy. Lesson number three. A meal is meant to be savored. Always make time to sit and enjoy. Never walk and eat. Ever. Especially if a mad Frenchwoman is barreling towards you on a bicycle. I noticed the scaffolding up today. You seem to be making good headway. Yes, Moriah was born to lead this team. Ah, but without Ben, there wouldn't be a team for me to lead. Well, then, all is well? Oui, only, um... Well, there is one thing. We think that Moriah's grandparents might have been part of the French Resistance. We found a secret room in the basement where we think they could have harbored Allies. Oui, there was personal effects and there were love letters. They were written to a man, JP, étranger, a stranger. We think that they sheltered him during the war. You only know your grandfather as Rene, but while he was young he preferred to be called by his middle name, Jean-Paul. If I recall, he and your grandmother didn't marry until the end of the war. So these letters would likely be... Before they met. So, he kept this woman a secret his entire life? Oh, so it was she who was hiding out, this Adrienne woman. Mm-hm. So, if her family really did work with the Allies, they probably sent her away to hide her. You know, it's like something out a movie. A beautiful French girl meets a handsome stranger. How do you know she was beautiful? Well, she's French. Do you not have something you need to be doing? Yeah, I'm working on the kitchen and I'm waiting for you to finish so we can go on a walk and discuss. So, are you finished? Okay. Ben: You're not being practical. And you're not honoring the spirit of what we're trying to accomplish here. The spirit only works if you're not ignoring practicality. What good is a kitchen if it's not functional? What good is a practical if it ignores historical intent? You haven't even looked at my plans. I don't need to look at your plans to know that... What? What are you looking at? What are you doing? We're stopping for coffee, which is both practical and in the spirt of what we're trying to accomplish. No, Ben, we are right in the middle of... Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. Lesson number three. Allow time for a meal each day. And since I haven't had breakfast, so. So, the countertop would be pink granite, like the stone in the lighthouse. Mm-hm. I found a fabricator in Auray that can make it for us, and then the upper cabinets would have leaded glass in it so that it matches with the exterior doors. The care you've taken, the attention to detail, it's really wonderful. No, it's... it's perfect. Thank you. Never in a million years did I imagine this. The French builder and the American architect. Makes for a good story. Mm. Uh, speaking of which, I have a confession. I read ahead. The letters?! You didn't! I'm sorry! I had to! Et tu, Brute. Betrayal on the deepest level. Okay, okay, but can I tell you? Yes, please. Your grandfather sounds like quite the renaissance man. The way she describes him painting her. Oh, by the light of the moon. It's incredibly romantic. Maybe I should be taking some notes. I didn't even know he painted. I don't think anyone did. He, um... He had this whole entire life before he met my grandmother. Wh-what? Just the way you look right now. Katherine: Bonjour! Bonjour. How wonderful it looks! We come bearing gifts. Ah, merci. You've been working so hard we thought perhaps you could use a little break. Merci, thank you, it's very thoughtful. I won't ask for a tour before it's complete, but from here it looks as beautiful as I imagine it did when it was built. Oh, it's probably better, thanks to the leadership of Moriah. Moriah, you have taught me a very valuable lesson on the importance of fighting for things that matter most. I owe you a lifetime of gratitude. Well, we won't take up your time. Nicholas is taking me to dinner. Ah, bon dîner. Thank you again. Have fun. Both: Merci. Au revoir. What? She's going to Paris. To join the Resistance? No, for Fashion Week. Yes, to join the fight. Listen. Come, come. Um, she says, uh... "I know not how long I will be gone, but I will send word as soon as I return. Beyond my bedroom window there is a rock shaped like a jewel, and..." "...one day we will stand arm in arm beside that rock and be married. Until then, you are my heart, my soul, my breath. Be well, my love. We will be together again soon." That's it? That's the last one? That's it. That's the last letter. Well, I mean, it can't be. We don't know what happened in Paris. We don't even know if she made it back here. I know my grandfather never married a woman by a rock shaped like a jewel. I know that rock. It's on the other side of the island. My grandfather took me there when I was young. Incroyable. You know, it's incredible that Nicholas and Katherine found each other 30 years later. Oui. To, uh... To find love once is lucky enough, but to lose it and find it again? It's almost impossible. What about you? Have you ever been in love? Uh... Oh, I'm sorry. You don't have to answer that. No. No, it's okay. I just... I'm a little embarrassed. I mean, here I am, I'm a woman who is born in the birthplace of romance and have never been in love herself. It's a little... I'm a little against the grain. I'm not sure men know what to make of me. I don't know if it's my work that keeps love away or if it's me. Well, it's definitely not the work. If I'm being honest, I... I don't think it's either. And you? Uh, there was someone for a time, and does it count as love if the other person doesn't feel the same way? I'm not sure. It's probably why I move around so much. Gone before things get too complicated. So, maybe it's my work that keeps love away or it's me. Aren't we just the most depressing pair? No, really. I mean, here we are, surrounded by all these beautiful love stories... - No, no, no, no, no. - And we're totally... Do not say it. It is too pathetic. It's just way too pathetic! I'm sorry. Actually, I don't know why we're laughing. I don't know why we're laughing either. Katherine, you're looking very fashionable today. Thank you, Jacques. I've been invited to go sailing. Wow. Are you fine for the afternoon? Yeah. Perfectly. Moriah hasn't been around much lately. She's, uh, alright? She's happy? Very much so. Shall we? Of course. Bye! Bye. Ah, perfect. Did you remember to... Oh, Katherine! I thought you were... No! Did he... On the sailboat. Tantine, I couldn't be happier for you. When is the wedding? As soon as humanly possible. Hey. I want to show you something. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Here. Come. Further. Come on. And stop. Turn around. Look what you've accomplished. You did it. Um. Vous avez réussi I'impossible et vous devriez en être incroyablement fier du ton nez. Yes, I'm very proud of my nose. Oh, uh. Well, you did it! The truth is, it's you who made this possible. You're so talented. You work hard. And often you're sort of fun to be around and, um... And, um, you make me smile. I've enjoyed these past few months very much. Yeah. Me, too. Get your things. I, uh... I'm going to take you on a little adventure. Come on, come on. Okay! This is it. I don't even remember where we were driving to, just that it was Grandad and I, and I don't know, we passed by and he pulled the car over. We got out and we stood in this very spot. And when I had asked him why he had stopped the car, he just looked at me and he smiled and he said, "This rock. It looks like a jewel, n'est pas?" And that was it. He just stood there for a few minutes and then we left. We never spoke of it again. That must the window. Ah, yes. The one she talks about in the letter. Let's see if anybody's home. Moriah: Bonjour. Bonjour. Bonjour? I have lived my whole life in this house. I have known nothing about this. It's heartbreaking. Did you ever know her well? Your aunt? I was born after she left for Paris. My mother was much younger than Adrienne and would not have known much of her romantic life, but she remembered those months when Adrienne was away. She talked of it often. Did your aunt ever make it back from Paris? No. Many at that time did not. But she was quite celebrated for her bravery. She died a hero. Is there any chance that you have a photograph of her? Sadly, all that remains are the few belongings she had with her when she died. One love lost. One lost and found 30 years later. The heart is a wonderful mystery. Powerful enough to move mountains, delicate enough to shatter at the slightest touch. But if we don't love without restraint, we risk missing out the greatest gift life has to offer. I've pictured this moment so many times, except in my mind it was always you wearing the dress. I haven't reached that chapter of my life yet. Haven't you? I've never seen you so happy as I have these past months. Excited to wake, to go to work. Well, I've been bringing the lighthouse back to life. My darling, it's you who has come to life. You're laughing again, there is joy. Call it what you like, I know love when I see it. Don't waste 30 years like I did wondering where it went. His life is abroad. Mine is here. How could I leave you? How could I leave them? Oh, my love. I know you want to keep your parents close, but they're not here. They are there. They always will be. You're holding onto what was, it's time to discover what can be. You're not alone. I love you, I always will, wherever you are in the world. Now, shall we get me married? S'il vous plait, tout monde. Une pet it second. Um... Three decades I spent searching for the thing that would make me feel whole, when all I needed was right here all along. My dear Katherine. Je t'aime. All: Vive le marié. Oh! Exactly. May I? You look beautiful. Thank you. You look... French? Oui. Yes. Very French. You surprise me at every turn. What? What is it? I, um... I got a call about a job in Chicago. It's one I've been working on for a long time. Ah. And, um, you're going? I'm going, yeah. And that's it? Moriah, this summer has been the most amazing... Don't do this. Moriah... No, You're doing what you said you always do. You're leaving before things complicate. But it is complicated. Your life is here. My life is... Yes, I understand, your life is wherever the job takes you. It's not that simple. You know what? You don't need to justify why you're going. It's okay. Just go. I don't want to leave like this. Maybe after Chicago I can, um... I come back and we could have more time. And what? Ben, I don't want to spend my life with someone who just comes to see me at their convenience. Moriah, please. No. I can't. Please, I can't do this. Just, um... If you're going to go, please, just go. Go. I'm sorry. Moriah? Ah, um... I had this whole thing prepared about... Well, about love and how it's pure and everlasting and joyful. But the truth is I really don't know anything about love. I do know that it surprises us. That it arrives when we least expect it. Sometimes it's in a place, or a person, sometimes that person leaves... ...and sometimes they come back. Sometimes they leave this world unexpectedly and you are left wondering how you will go on. But you do. And sometimes it's in the food we eat, and the wine that we drink, and the view that leaves you breathless. One thing I know for sure, we can't control it, no matter how hard we try. And that leaves us vulnerable to it. And all we can do is surrender. And these two have done just that. Katherine, Tantine. No one deserves this day more than you. You are... ...oui, my aunt, but my best friend, my guardian angel. I'm so happy you have found your love again. Je t'aime. M'aussi. Okay. That's it. Ma félicitations. Congratulations. Let me speak to her. Yes. When we were little, do you recall collecting the rolls from the butcher paper? We would stare through them at the sky pretending we were astronomers studying the stars. We felt so insignificant, like we were little specs floating in the cosmos. And yet, the woman before me is anything but insignificant. She's the brightest star in the sky. Take the risk. You're worth it. And so is he. Hey. Oh. Merci. When I was younger I would stay and dance all night, but these days... That song they played for the first dance. Do you know it? It tells the story of two strangers pushed together by a dancing crowd, and they feel something they have never felt before. Joy and happiness. They feel fulfilled. But then, the crowd launches into a mad far an do la, everyone dancing together, spinning in circles, and our two strangers are torn apart. The strangers struggle to find one another, they cry out in pain. To receive life's greatest gift, and then have it snatched away. They are lost. Broken. This was a mistake. We have to go back. I have to go back. Stop the boat! Yes, we must! This man is in love! Please work. We're not stopping are we? No, that was pretty exciting though. Ben! I thought you left! I did! I stole a lifeboat. It was terrifying! I tried to signal you, but you came back! I couldn't leave you. I didn't want you to. I'm in love with you. I'm in love with you, too. Lesson number two. The people in your life are everything. I swear, it wasn't me. Nicholas: To love. Both lost and found. To new beginnings. To the places we've been and the places we're heading, and to the light that will always be here to guide us home. And to a honeymoon 30 years overdue. All: Santé. Nicholas. Oh, right. The key. Oui. We will take very good care of it while you're away. No, my darling. You will take great care of it because it belongs to you now. The world deserves to share in its beauty. To revel in its history. It's yours. It always has been. Besides, this cottage isn't big enough for all of us. We wanted you to have it. Merci. Both: Je t'aime. Nicholas: We have a plane to catch. Yes. Okay, bye. Au revoir! - Bon voyage! - Katherine: Au revoir! - Bon voyage! - Katherine: Merci!
