Look: a drop of water turned into a diamond! A diamond, worthy of a khan! but to be worn by you, when you become my wife! Becoming your wife!? ha-ha, Your wife? Look at yourself. So, you think I am too ugly?! As if only you can be beautiful. It'll be done with your beauty! Faithful servants! Bring me the mirror of darkness.

Behold how you look from now on! Let us see if someone will love you with these looks! As a frog you will live for 3 years and 3 days Vassilisa the beautiful only to return to your human form by night. After that time you may humbly return to accept my proposal for now,.. be gone...to the swamps with you! In the time of old there lived a czar who had three sons here. As they had become grown men the czar had called them to him and said My dear sons as you have become of age I called you here to settle the matter... that none of you has gotten married, and therefore has no children, leaving me without grandchildren. Dear father, we honour you. but non of us has found a wife yet. Right so. Therefore, each of you take an arrow... and shoot it any direction you like. There where the arrow lands, the girl who finds it, will be your bride. Now go! The oldest son rode in the direction of a Bojar*'s castle. *court-nobleman The arrow was found by the bojar's daughter. The second son climbed over rocks where the arrow landed on a merchant's door His bride was the merchant's daughter. The third son of the czar, saw the arrow fly over a forest... to finally land in the mist of a swamp. He couldn't find where it went. Frog, frog, are you my fiancee? What are you looking for? I am looking if I overlooked a hidden maiden. I am not your miracle bride? No, you can't be her. But you...please consider me. I shall never disappoint you, prince Ivan. Let me be your wife. What?! What?! How could I marry... a frog? Is that all you see, Princes Ivan? Yet my father's will must be obeyed and there is no one else here. Wait frog, wait. I will marry you. So the czar blessed three weddings. The oldest married the bojar's daughter. The second married the merchant's daughter And lastly prince Ivan... married the frog. The next day the king called his sons to him once more. Now you have married, I wish to find out, which of you sons has married the best woman. I want each wife to embroid me a rug tonight. Now go. How does a frog ever can do such a thing. What is wrong, dear prince Ivan, why do you look so sad My father would have you embroider him a royal silken rug. Have faith dear Ivan, sleep and dream the morning often brings solutions that the evening hasn't thought of. Servants come here, be swift, and obey us with this. We'll obey you - As you should! Embroid us a rug! He, what motive should be on it? What cloth should we use? How big should it be? How can we help? We'll tell you Embroid us a rug. A rug in one night. How can it be done proper? It can't be done well. It can't be done by us! We can't, excuse us. Not accepted: You're to get us a rug! We now who can do it. We ask the soldier. Yes, a soldier always know how to obey! I will not let you down In need no brush and not a needle to make a picture for my true love's sake I use what lives within my heart What I love the most herbal flowers and starlight will serve to me as paint tonight It is the truest art it is the truest art! and every heavenly star and constellation gives me the purest inspiration to help me put what's real and warm in a small but heartfelt form to show to him tomorrow at last this beam of light will slip into the shape of a slender ship sailing on the sea So if our paths of life should part the power of our joining hearts will reach across the raging seas and bring my true love back to me one thing remains to picture here the thing that my heart holds the most dear in all of time and space: my true loves face Let the needles march the canvas: 1,2,3 Showing bravely a new picture 1,2,3 Not one but even two at once, 1,2,3 can't be fast enough to make it 1,2,3 husband, husband wake up. Come and see what I brought. In this box is the rug you asked for. You will not be disappointed. Well you lads, let's see what the hands of your wife's have made. Very interesting. hang it in the stables. My horse will love it. Let me see the next one, my son. It's like a fish weaved it. Using her fins. And what kind of rug did our little frog princess make? A lilly pad perhaps... well... show me. What a miracle...from the frog. The little frog is a princess after all. Listen The little frog is a princess after all. Listen tonight we will feast in honour of this rug. A celebration. Everyone must come! Must I bring my wife? - Of course you'll bring her - As you wish, father. Prince Ivan, what happened? What did the king say? Did he not like the rug? Or are you ashamed of me again? Frog, oh frog, you are so kind and good. And yet I fear to show you tonight at the feast Oh, how can I feel so ashamed of you. I understand my prince. Go to the feast on your own and I will come later. You will hear thunder and feel the earth thrill. But don't fear Just tell the people at the feast that it is only your frog princess approaching. Welcome my son. Have you come without your loving wife? or is she still busy making herself beautiful? What happened to your wife? Is she still bathing perhaps? Making her self beautiful. - In the pond outside the castle! Don't worry, everybody. Calm down. It's just my frog wife, who is approaching I am sorry my prince for being so late. I wanted your family to see me at my best. Who are you? Your wife, my husband, Vassilisa. Vassilisa the beautiful The frog was enchanted. We should not have laughed at her. Welcome dear children.

But now, farewell, I will see you never again. I must return to the castle of Kachee the never dying. Farewell Ivan Farewell! Goodbye my love, I sing to you in silence. Knowing that how ever hard I try I'll never see your face again or touch you. Goodbye my love goodbye Farewell, forever. Good day, young man. What brings you into my forest on this lovely day? I am looking for my love, Vassilisa the beautiful. She has been taken by the evil Kachee. I know, I know. Your wife, kept by Kachee, suffers. Eeh, prince Ivan, I didn't expect you so soon. Tell me prince, what made you think that you could burn up the frog skin? It wasn't yours. Watch this interesting toadstool. It will lead you to Kachee's castle. Thank you, grandfather! Wait for me twig, wait for me please, we must be careful. For danger. No, please, no, Prince Ivan, don't shoot me or my children. We will help you someday. - All right Be off with you!

I've learned to trust solemn promises Don't orphan my children If you allow me to live You'll someday have a loyal friend All right. Well, take care of your family! I will help you too. Prince Ivan, please help me. My child is trapped in the nets of a fisherman Send him to me in the sea, and I will be you servant when need arises. Be free, my little fish! Hut of Baba Yaga, stay still as can be! With your front to the wood and you door facing me! Who commands my house so strongly to do his bidding? Well, It's no other then the prince coming to visit this old lady! I must rescue my love from the evil hands of Kachee and only the clever and wise Baba Yaga can tell me how it can be done! And in the morning Baba Yaga told him where to find Vassilisa the beautiful, and how to beat the immortal Kachee Vassilisa the beautiful can not be rescued until Kachee the immortal is slain And killing Kachee is impossible without the help of the beautiful, clever and wise Baba Yaga. Come closer, and now listen carefully: Kachee's death lies on the tip of a needle... the needle is nestled in a tiny egg inside the stomach of a duck and the duck has been swallowed by a rabbit... and the rabbit abides in a chest made of stone... which hangs from a high oak guarded by a dragon but I know a way to reach that oak That way, Prince Ivan, is on the back of my magic steed. So be of! Kachee's death will bring Baba Yaga great joy! Ah, the prince comes for me! He'll not get far! The serpent will soon destroy him. My breath will burn your flesh! It's not me who will find death in your breath! Go home, you fool, or you will not go home at all! You will go to your doom! He's dead, he's dead, that foolish prince. No, you destroyed my beautiful serpent! But Vassilisa the beautiful, you will never see again! Vassilisa the beautiful, now turn to gold! My promis to help I will now fulfil. I've lost it! I've lost my chance of happiness! I must get rid of this clever prince! Forever! Here comes Kachee! You better hurry! I'll open it! Kachee's death lies in this needle! And so Prince Ivan and Vassilisa the beautiful returned home to live happily ever after! THE END subs by Eus
