Yo. Man, what's up with that? You know me? You talking to me? Homey, you getting bad with me? You want me to fuck you up? - Fuck him up, man. - Jump on him. You couldn't fuck up your own mother. For that, motherfucker, you die. Come here, man. Come here, man. I'm hurting. Get off the floor, man. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending... another performance of Ghetto Theatre. Return with us next week as we perform our rendition... of "Romeo and Latoya." Thank you. Did the mailman come? Maria to the front counter, please. Maria to the front counter. Johnny, Monday's the deadline... on that Hispanic scholarship I've been telling you about. Yeah, right. I forgot about that. My son got his in two weeks already... so you better get moving. Yeah, OK, I will. OK. Hey, how you doing, Daria? Hi, Johnny. How you doing? I don't know. I'm doing alright. Haven't seen you in the store in a long time. Yeah. I've been feeling kind of lazy. You know? Just not wanting to shop. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know that feeling. Hey, I was wondering, you know... if you're not doing anything tomorrow night... would you like to go out or something? No, sorry. I've got plans. Well, I'll be seeing you. Alright, I'll be seeing you. Maybe next week. OK? Yeah, next week. That sounds terrific. OK. Bye. Alright, bye. God bless you. I'll get her. Look, Mr Stevens, we're fed up with your behaviour. We've sent you out to several work programs... and you never show up. If you don't want your welfare checks terminated... you'd better straighten up. This is because I'm black, right? What are you talking about? You can be honest with me. You're doing this to me because I'm black, right? Fine. I'll be honest. I'm doing this because I think you're a bum. I'm a bum. You calling me a bum because I'm black, right? If I was a white guy, I'd be eccentric... but now I got to be a bum? No, if you were a white guy, you'd be a white bum. I don't think that's funny. It wasn't meant to be. I think you're not showing up to our work programs... because you don't want to be involved in them... which would simply lead to a termination of your checks. Oh, no. Whatever gave you that idea? I love your work programs. Especially the one you sent me on last week. The one where I'm supposed to clean the toilets. I love that type of stuff. I do that stuff all the time at home. That's what you'd expect a black man to do, right? This conversation is over. I'm sending you to one last program. It's in Brooklyn. Brooklyn? That's on the other side of the world! If you don't go, your case will be terminated. You're doing this because I'm black, right? We have several kinds of magazines to choose from, sir. Even magazines specific to your occupation. By the way, sir, what is your occupation? We have several kinds of magazines, sir. Even magazines specific to your occupation. May I ask what your occupation is? Oh, that's wonderful. Yes, we have all kinds of magazines, sir. Even magazines specific to your occupation. What is your occupation, sir? You're an agent. Really? You mean like in movies? Well, my name is Thomas McNeal... and I'm an actor. Yeah, really. What have I done? Well, did you see "Rain Man"? I was up to play a part of a waiter in "Rain Man"... but they wrote out the scene. Yeah, that happens sometimes. Listen. Look, forget about the magazines. They suck. Just take my word for it. Do you think I could get your name or address-- Yes, we have excellent magazines, sir. All sorts of magazines. Even magazines specific to your occupation, sir. Hello. Hey! Candy, how you doing? Yeah. I'm fine. No, I'm fine. When, tonight? I can't. I'm hanging out with the fellas. No. When? When did I promise that? Come on, baby. You can't count on anything I say when I'm doing that. Hello? Hello. Hey! Wendy, how you doing? I'm OK. What? No, I can't, not tonight. I'm hanging out with the fellas. No. I know, Wendy, but-- When did I promise that? It figures. I'm sorry, Wendy, but I can't. I told you-- But, Wendy, listen-- But, Wendy, but listen-- But, Wendy, but-- Alright, forget it. So I lied, OK? So forget-- Oh, shit. What the fuck happened to you? Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Damn. It's me, man. Thank God. I thought white people moved in the neighbourhood. Man, I'm a little short on cash tonight. I was hoping you could lend me a couple of bucks. Come on, man, a few dollars. How much you owe me already? I don't know. $20, $30. $137.86. Come on, man. What do you care anyway? You don't work for it. You get it from your girlfriends. What difference does it make where I get it from, man? That's how much you owe me. Look, you be honest with me. You're doing this because I'm black, right? I'm doing this because you're an ugly motherfucker. Do me a favour, could you get the door, please? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Please. This is because I'm black. Because I'm a black man in a white land. I'm answering doors for you. Next thing you know... I'll be driving motherfucking Miss Daisy. What? I'm looking for Vinny. Who? Vinny. The guy who lives here. Vinny? You must be talking about Fernando. No, man, she means Vinny. Come on in, baby. How are you doing? Good. I brought you dinner. It's pork chops with yellow rice. I made it myself. That's beautiful. Baby, that's so nice. That's so sweet. I wish everybody was so nice to me. Come on in. I wanted to ask you something, sweetie. If it's possible, you think you could give me... a couple of dollars tonight? I'm running a little short. I thought we were staying in tonight. Well, what happened was this. You know, Willie's--Willie's... Willie's father ran into a little problem... and he's really, really sick. And so, all the fellas are all gonna get together... and go visit him. Right, Willie? - Huh? - Right, Willie? Oh, yeah. He's gonna die. And if we don't visit him, he's gonna die. And death hurts. You see, Willie has been so taken... he's so stunned with what's been going on... that he says crazy things sometimes, right, Willie? That's right, Fernan--Vinny. See what I mean? You're so sweet. How much do you need? Damn, man, what are you... dumb, stupid, retarded, or all of the above? I didn't do anything. You did enough, bro. Do me a favour. From now on, if ever I ask you a question... don't say anything, man. Just nod, alright? I was just trying to help you. Don't help, bro. If I need help from you, I know I'm in big trouble. - Do me a favour, just nod. - OK, OK. So cut the shit. Where are we going, bro? We're going to pick up Johnny. Johnny? Johnny? We just hung out with that sad-sack motherfucker. We're gonna hang out with him again? Johnny's my best friend. I know that, man, but... that guy gets so depressing and shit, man. He's like fucking Mr Spock and shit. Look, Johnny ain't going, I ain't going. That's my boy, alright? That's cool, man. Tell the guy to lighten up, that's all. OK, Fernando. Do me a favour, man. I can't believe you're calling me Fernando. From now on, do me a favour... please, especially in front of a woman... you got to call me Vinny. Do me a favour, man. Promise me. Call me Vinny, alright? I'll call you Vinny Pantagalini if you want me to. If I hear one of you fuckers call me Fernando... I swear to God, I'll die of a heart attack. What's up, John? Willie, how you doing, man? What's up? - Yo, man. - Hey, Fernando. It's Vinny. My name's Vinny. Yeah, right. Vinny. I forgot. I'm sorry. It's alright. So, what are you guys doing here tonight, man? Yo, man, it's Friday night. Time to have some fun. Yeah. I don't know. I feel kind of depressed tonight, man. You see that, man. The guy's depressed. You don't want to take a chance on ruining the guy's state. I'm serious and shit. Can you do me a favour, Vincente, and stay out of this? - I'm talking to my friend. - That's fine. The only thing I'm saying is, the guy's not feeling-- Maybe we should just not twist his arm. Could you do me a favour and go over there? I'm talking to my friend, alright? No, I'm gonna go. I'm just saying... That's it. I'm not saying any more. Don't worry about it, Willie. Man, it's not gonna be the same without you. I don't know, man. I gotta wake up early tomorrow. I gotta open up the store. I don't know. If you're not gonna do it for yourself, do it for me. Please don't let me hang out with that clown all night. I don't know. Oh, man, I don't know. Alright, you got me. I'll go check out. Give me a minute. - Alright. - OK, man? You owe me. He's not going, right? He's going. - He's gonna go? - He's going. Alright. Pay attention to me, OK? Do I have your attention? You wanted him to come, right? Understand what I just said? You wanted him to come. You. Nobody else. The magic word is you. Get to the point. You wanted him to come. You are responsible for him. - What? - That's right. If I should have a boring, depressing evening... because of him, you are responsible. You. Nobody else. You, alright? You. You. Jesus. I wear this stupid outfit so much... one morning it's going to jump out of this locker... and meet me at my front door. Hello. I know what you're talking about, man. I got five of these ugly suckers myself at home. Here's the scholarship form. You better take it because Monday's the deadline. Ah, Pedro. What? I don't know, man. I'm not the college type, alright? No, what type are you? The supermarket type? Don't be stupid. You got a good shot at this. You got excellent grades in high school. You did. I can't understand how you wasted two years... hanging around this joint. Because I... Man, I'll do it next year, alright? No. Next year will be too late... because you'll be too old to qualify. Take it. What are you afraid of? Take it. Why Johnny, man? Why him? Would you shut up? Here he comes. What's up, guys? Where we going? Come on. We're going to pick up Tommy. OK. Let's go, Willie. Vamanos, Fernando. It's you. You. Alright, would you just shut up? Did you call Tommy to let him know you were coming? Nah, man. I'm sure it's cool. You can't go barging into people's houses like that. That's ridiculous, man. That's not right. Watch this. Open up! It's the police. Open up! I know you got that 9-year-old girl in there. Oh, man! You big imitation Italian motherfucker. Come on in, y'all. What y'all doing here? It's Friday night. Hang out night, man. Y'all should call somebody before you come to their house. Why, man? What's up? I made plans with my lady for tonight. See, I told you, man. Come on, bro! You don't want to hang out with the fellas? Y'all should call me. You'd have called earlier, maybe I could change my plans. It's too late now. I told you. Didn't I tell you, guys? You shouldn't be barging into people's houses like that. If he ain't going, he ain't going. That's it. What do you mean, "If he's not going, he's not going"? That's bullshit! What's the matter? It's like you said. You shouldn't force somebody... to do something they don't want to do. Twist their arm and all that. This is different, OK? Tommy's got to go. Oh, yeah? Why? Because Tommy's got something that you and me and Willie... ain't got all put together. - What's that? - Tom has a car! Come on! We need you and your second-hand cop car. You got to come. What's the matter with you? There's my lady. You gonna give up a night on the town... to hang out with some girl? She ain't some girl, man. She's an incredibly beautiful and wonderful girl, alright? This time, I think it's really love. Alright, man. Come on, man! When did Cupid shoot you in your ass? You gonna give up a night of hangin' with your homeboys... your bestest friends for years and years... just to hang out with some ugly girl? She ain't ugly, man. She's incredibly beautiful. Come on, man. I know your taste in women. She probably looks like a duck. That's what you think. This girl's so fine... you be begging to drink her bath water, motherfucker. Right here, I got $10 that says your girl is ugly. I'm talkin' "ug"-fucking-"ly". - Can you back it up? - Yeah, I'll back it up. Who here's with me? Come on! You guys know Tommy's taste in women. Alright, alright, I got a $10 food stamp... that says this girl's ugly with a capital "Ug." I got $10 right here on that ugly person, man. That's $30 I got to back up. That's not fair. You're the one that says she's so fine. Are you afraid she's ugly, and you gonna lose? I ain't afraid she's ugly, man. I know the girl's fine. People have different opinions what fine is. How we gonna handle this? I got it, man. Why don't we judge it like a Miss America pageant? We vote on a scale of 1 to 10, bro. Your girlfriend's got to be at least a nine. Nine? Come on, man. Nine's too high. If we vote, she gotta be at least a five. Five? My grandmother's a five, and she's dead. I don't care, man. Nine is just too high. She's gotta be at least a seven. There you go, man. Seven is cool. I could do that. How about you? Fine. You want to know what fine is? I'll show you fine. This girl is fine. F-i-n-e. Fine. That should be her last name. Vanessa Fine. And another thing, y'all, don't be so obvious. Don't be staring at her like she's an eye chart... 'cause she's not only beautiful, but she's smart... and she'll pick up on that. - Who is it? - It's Tommy. Hi, baby. How you doing? Honey, what you doing? How come you ain't dressed? I thought we was going out tonight. Oh, no, no, no. I'm really sick. It just came over me this morning. How come you ain't call me? I'm sorry. I've been asleep all day. I just forgot. I guess that means tonight is off. Yeah. I'm really sorry. OK. Alright, I hope you feel better. - Thanks, babe. - OK. Bye-bye. She's beautiful, ain't she? She looks like a duck. Where's my money, man? She's gorgeous. Willie, tell him, man. I give the ho a two. Where do you keep your eyes? In your ass? That's how I feel. Come on, man. Y'all got to be fair now. Cough up the dillies, bro. Wait a second. That's two for your side. I think she's gorgeous. That means Johnny here has the deciding vote. No, man. I don't want to be deciding vote. What are you afraid of, bro? I'm not afraid, man. I'm not afraid. I didn't get a good look at her. That's what happened. He didn't get a good look, so we're even. Even? Bring the girl back out, bro. What? That's stupid. I ain't bringing her back out. Then I guess that means we won. It's still two against one, right? $30 is $30. Hi, sweetie. What are you still doing here? I was worried about you, baby. You want me to get you some aspirin from the store? - What are you doing? - Admiring your beautiful skin. You know I always liked your skin. You're such a romantic. I don't need anything. I just need to get back to sleep, OK? OK. You go get your beauty rest, darlin'. - OK. - Alright. - Bye, lover. - Bye-bye. Oh, no, guys. No, no. I don't want to be the deciding vote, OK? Just be honest. Alright. OK? Alright. She was sort of like... I don't know. She was... 'Cause she had... You know...Hell, man... She was an eight. - Alright! An eight! - Damn! Make out all checks to Mr Thomas McNeal. Thank you. You told me to be honest, man. You was honest, Johnny. Actually, you weren't. She's really a nine. You know who's responsible for this, right? You're responsible for this. Where's the first stop, y'all? Wherever the girlies are, bro. You're crazy, Vinny, man. You keep messing with them girls like that... and one day, you'll come down with something strange. Nah, not me. Let me show you something, man. You see this here? Do you know what this is? - What? - What is this? - What is this? - I know what it is. - What is this? - I know. - What is this? - It's a condom, man. Wrong. It's a super-condom. This thing has an ingredient in it called Nonoxynol-9. You hear what I said? Nonoxynol-9. Alright. With that, no matter who you're with... no matter what they got, with this... knock that shit right out. You can fuck an elephant with this condom. I'm sure you have, Vinny. Oh, man, please. Don't bring your girlfriend into the conversation. Johnny, I didn't know you liked fat women. Oh, shit! Look at that. The perfect opportunity for me to use my super-condom, man. Slow the car down, man. Yo, yo, yo! Yo, baby! Yo, Vinny! Get your ass out of my face, man. What's your name, man? My name is Vinny. I'm from Italy. I'm trying to drive here. Get your hairy, pimply anus in here, man. Damn. This is hazardous to my driving, man. Come on, baby, why don't you come for a ride? What are you doing, man? You trying to pick up my daughters? Oh, shit. Shit, man. Let's get the fuck out of here. You don't pick up my daughters! You're a puto! I'll kill you, man! Come on, Tommy. Move the car, man! Oh, shit! Look, man, if them bottles hit my car... I'd get out and kick your ass, man. It wasn't my fault. It was your fault. You're the one who made... that crazy Puerto Rican come over here. Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Watch it with that "crazy Puerto Rican" stuff. Don't say stuff about my people. What stuff? I just said "crazy Puerto Rican." You said it again. I told you not to say it, man. Don't talk about my people like that. Yo, Vinny, man. Did you hear the way he's talking about our people? Yo, Vinny, man. Don't you care? Man, what am I supposed to say to that shit? Come on, man. Say anything. You don't even think you're Puerto Rican, do you? Yo, he's Italian. No, man. I can't believe you said that. It's not true, man. I don't think I'm Italian. Any more brews back there? No, Tommy, you had the last one. Damn. We got to stop. I'm going to get some more. Yo, Johnny, put another dollar in, man. - Here's my two. - Thanks. Hey, man. You ain't got nothing? You can't put in 50 cents? Damn, Willie, you're pitiful. Come on, put me down. I'll put you down, man. You're an ugly motherfucker. How's that? Shit, man. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. We all got your way. No, no, no, don't count me in that. No more, man. I've had it. Come on, Vinny. Willie would do it for you. That's the point, man. That boy never has any money, and I'm tired of it. That's a black thing, you see? The white man oppressing me, keeping me down. What is this, man? The Gettysburg Address? Forget it. I'll put in the difference. I just want some brew. You're being brainwashed by the white man... into thinking that all minorities got to be poor. Willie, please shut the fuck up. Boy's always got to be coming up with something. "Put me down." White man, black man. Shit. Do yourself a favour, man. Get a job. Stop bothering people. Do you have a job, Vinny? Yeah! We're talking about him, not me. I know, man. Do you have a job? There it is. Ain't none of your business if I got a job or not. That's because you don't have a job, man. It's because all the money you've gotten... and all the food you've ever gotten... everything you've ever gotten in your life... you've gotten from poor innocent women. That's why, man. You're a leech and a parasite. You know who's responsible for this, right? Look at me. You know who's responsible for this? Yo! Let's hit the road. Yo, man. That looks like Louie-Louie over there. Oh, shit. That's him. Louie! - Lou-Lou. - He's dope. What's up, man? What's up? What's going on, man? What you doing around here? Just chillin', workin'. Doing the same old. Tell me something, any parties? Anything going out tonight? Not in the boogie down Bronx, homeboy. Bronx is dead. But y'all should check out Manny-hatty. Yeah? Manhattan's what's happening tonight? I don't feel like going to Manhattan tonight. Manhattan is where it's at. That's why I won't even be hangin' in the Bronx, chief. Manhattan is the life, B. Let's just hang out in the Bronx tonight, alright? Whatever, home piece. I got to tip. Take care, man. Lou-Lou is bad, bro. He's dope and all that. That boy's got dollars on his dollars. Alright. Here we go all around. One for Johnny. Can I check your ID, please? One for Willie... who didn't put in a fucking dime as usual. - And one for Tommy here. - Thank you, brother. Excuse me, Tommy. How many beers did you have? I don't know. Two or three. Two or three, man? You shouldn't have another beer if you're driving. I'm sorry. Please, man. Give me that goddamn-- I'm serious. You can't be drinking and driving. Man, you're going to be drinking and walking... if you don't give me that fucking beer. Come on, man. We got six of them here. - Don't give it to him. - Get the fuck out of here. What's the matter with you? Grow up, Johnny, man. - Acting like a little kid. - You are. I don't know what you're afraid of, man. What the fuck are you afraid of? Oh, shit. Look at that. Louie-Louie said there ain't nothing happening in the Bronx. Oh, my God! Make sure there ain't no big, fat, hairy motherfuckers... with beer bottles out there, man. Whoo! Baby! Whoo! - Pull the car over. - Chill out, man. Shit. Come here! Mama! Come on, man. Pull over. The last motherfucker was throwing shit at my car. - Just calm down. - Pull over, man. Why the fuck are you talking to little girls, man? - Pull over. - I'm pulling over. You're an asshole, man. Damn! Come on out here, Tommy. Where'd them women go, man? You hear that? Where's that coming from, man? Where's that music coming from? Look right there. The window. Shit. There's a party up there. Let's go. No, man. Nobody knows you up there. I'll just knock on the door and say, "Jose sent us." Jose? You don't know no Jose, Vinny, man. It's a Puerto Rican party. There's got to be one Jose up there, right? Vinny, man, it's not going to work. Damn! Quiet. What's the matter with you? It's coming from over there. It's right here. It's not going to work, man. Stop it, will you? This is going to work. Let me do the talking. I'll get us in. Act natural. How you doing? Can I help you? Jose sent us. Yeah, well, OK. Come in. Thank you. Man, I hate house parties. I always feel like I'm locked in a closet. You're the last guy who should say anything... 'cause you ain't got no money. You got in here for free, so shut the fuck up. Where's the food? You can get some food, man. I'm going to get me a woman. Damn, I love Latin music. Yeah, Tommy? I didn't know that, man. Great. Why don't you go ahead and dance? I love the music, but I could never dance to it. Sure you could, man. It's real easy. Anybody can dance. Here, I'll show you. Watch this. Nah. That's OK. Come on. Try it, man. No, man, I'm afraid to. - Why, man? - Because that's how it starts. That's how what starts? You know, Johnny. That's how it starts. No, I don't know, man. How what starts? It starts with the dancing, man. Next thing you know, I'll be wearing polyester suits... with bell-bottom pants, eating rice and beans. It's alright. Tommy, I take that as a racist statement, man. That ain't no racist statement. It's just a fact. I don't look good in bell-bottoms. Hi, baby, come here. You're very, very attractive. I just want to tell you something. Come here for a second. Ugly bitch. Who invited you here, man? Jose. Jose? Jose. Which Jose? Point him out. He's probably not here. He's late or something. What's his last name, this Jose? That's it, Tommy. You're getting it, man. Oh, my God, man. I feel my pants expanding at the bottom already. Cut the shit, man, and just keep dancing. Am I rocking it? Yeah, you're rocking it, man. Just keep it loose. Keep it flowing. You're pretty good at this, man. You should get on that dance floor... and find you one of those hot Spanish mamas. You might find your future wife tonight. Not me, man. I'm not going to go that far. I've already got my mind on a special girl. Yeah? Who is he? Tommy, this girl, she's innocent and virginal. This the same girl you've been talking about for weeks? You still ain't got that booty yet? This girl's not about booty. She's a shy and sensitive thing. She's innocent, virginal, shy, and sensitive. I don't know about you, but she sounds like a drag. Yeah, so after I finished law school... I decided I didn't want to devote my life to one thing. So I was trying to find something in my life... that I could do on those dull spaces... like on the weekends and on holidays. That's when I decided to become an astronaut. Mendez. It was Mendez. No, no, it wasn't Mendez. It wasn't Mendez. It was... Perez. Perez? No, it wasn't Perez. Couldn't have been Perez. Vasquez. Jose Vasquez. You know what I think, bro? I think you're full of shit, black boy. Is that what you think I am? I'm not black. I'm Dominican. You're a Dominican? Get the fuck out of here! Let's go! Nobody invited you! You guys come back here again, I'm going to get my gun. Fucking pendejo. Goddamn! What the fuck's the matter with you guys? What the hell did you guys do? - What? - Who? What? Who? Come on, you guys know. You must have done something to get our asses kicked out. You want to know what the fuck I did? I was born black, motherfucker! That's what I did! Stop with that black shit. They threw me out of that party because I was black! Hold up, man. They said that to you in there? That's right. That's your people for you. Wait a second, Willie. I was in that party, man. I was in there, fighting for you. You going to say that shit now? That wasn't right, man. I didn't do shit. Yo, Willie. Are you OK, man? Yeah, man. Y'all just stop thinking about it, man. Those guys were assholes, alright? Wait a second. Where you going? I'm driving into Manhattan. Louie-Louie was right. The Bronx is wack tonight. When you get to Harlem, let me out. What you got against Manhattan? I wait all week to hang out with you guys. I'm usually in my damn, funky apartment... sitting there doing nothing, bored to death. I die for these Fridays. I want to hang out with my homeboys... not some white people from Manhattan. I'm driving into Manhattan and that's that, man... so just grow up and deal with it. Alright! Manhattan! Let's get some rich white women. That's what you need, a white woman. That'll make you feel just great, won't it? Yo, fellas. See that building right there? I auditioned for a part in a TV movie there last week. Seriously, Tommy? What happened, man? They loved me, man. I was the best thing that they've seen in a long time. - They told you that? - When I was in college... I was the best actor in my acting class. They all looked up to me like I was William Shatner. College? Tommy, I didn't know you went to college. Yeah, I went to college. I got a degree, man. Did you like it? To tell you the truth, it sucked. It's like a big stall, you know? Big nothing. I'll tell you, man, I agree with Tommy. I went to college. What? You? You went to college? What? Hey, man. I'm a college man. What? I'm serious, man. And I'll tell you something. It was the most miserable, frustrating... humiliating two weeks of my life. Yeah. Yo, Tommy, man... if somebody came up to you and said... "I'm interested in going to college"... and all that, blah, blah, blah... what would you tell him? I'd tell them not to waste their time, man. You go to school for four years, get that stupid degree... then you get out and get the same lousy jobs... for the same lousy pay, man. It ain't worth it, man. Yeah. I see what you're saying. Look where we're at! Yeah! Manny-hanny! This is the life! Yes! Come on in. It ain't no sin. You got a quarter? Yeah, I got a quarter. You got a quarter? Yeah, I got a quarter. Man, watch it! Damn, they got a little TV. That's cool, man. Shut the fuck up. Put the quarter in. Cool it, man. Watch your leg. I'm trying to get the quarter in, alright? Somebody's rubbing against me. I don't like that shit. You want to borrow my super-condom with Nonoxynol-9? That shit ain't funny, man. Hey, man! Watch it! Great, man. Just great, Tommy. What happened? Tommy knocked the quarter out of my hand. It's lying there right by his foot. Why don't you bend down and pick up the quarter? Yo, man, fuck you. Come on, man. I ain't bending down in this fucking place. You're crazy. I'll get it, man. I can reach it. - Oh, man! - Whoa! Take it easy! Watch your hand, man! This is stupid, man! Everybody out of the fucking booth! Get out of the fucking booth. Come on. Let's go. Out of the fucking booth. Johnny? Johnny, did you get the quarter, man? - I got the quarter. - Good. Let's go. In the fucking booth. You in yet, man? Lock the door. Put it in. - Shit! - That's bad! Wish those men would move so I could see these women! That girl looks familiar. Damn. She's working it. Wait a minute! What a gyp! Gyp! Come on. What the fuck? We'll get another quarter. What's the matter? Yo, Johnny. Yo, man, what's up? Damn, man. I knew that boy was scared of pussy... but this is ridiculous. You want to talk about it? Whatever it is, it can't be that bad. What happened? Did Vinny fart in the booth? That's funny. I'll tell you what happened. The boy saw a pussy and went into stitches. He ain't never going to recover, either. Come on, Vinny. Everybody's seen a pussy by the time they're 18. Nah, man. I'm serious. There's a lot of real late bloomers out there. Watch this. Hey, Johnny. Which way do a pussy go, man? Like this or like this? What are you afraid of? Fucking asshole! You could've got us killed! Fuck! Shit. Man. Fuck. Fuck! You really fucked it up this time, man. Fuck you, Vinny, alright? Fuck you! Find a phone so I can call a towing place. You see that, huh? He's gonna start with that depression shit. I give him five minutes before he starts talking... about people starving in China and shit. Watch. Would you leave him alone? Watch. You alright, man? He's a fucking asshole, man! He could've got us all fucking killed, man! Alright, man. Take it easy. It's OK. We're all alive. It's cool. I just feel stupid. I'm just over here caught up in my own problems... when, hell, there's people in China who are starving. I'm over here feeling sorry for myself. Willie, tell me, man. Did you ever know somebody that you thought... was better than the rest of the world... you know, different... then you came to find out that they're not... that they're actually even worse? Who you talking about? Fernando? Hey, Vinny, man. It's Vinny, alright? Come on! Alright, alright. We got it, we got it. Now would you shut the fuck up? I'm not worried about that clown. I'm talking about a girl... a girl that I was once really crazy about. That's what I'm talking about. What made you think of her? 'Cause I saw her tonight. She was in that X-rated movie we saw at the peep show. Was that the innocent and virginal girl... you've been telling us about for weeks? Yeah. That's her. That's Daria. What made you think she was innocent and virginal? I don't know. What do you mean? What are you talking about? Did she come tell you she was innocent and virginal? No, man. Come on. Who's gonna come up to you and say shit like that? That's what I'm trying to say. You can't hate this girl... 'cause she's not what you want her to be. Yeah, but you don't understand, man. The way she was acting, I just thought she was-- Yeah, but that's what you're thinking. You can't blame her for what you're thinking. Stop trying to turn this girl into something she's not. She's probably still a good person. I mean, if I was a girl and I hated working... I could see myself up on that screen... you know, naked, shaking my ass. Fuck that. You make a lot of money doing that shit. Sure beats cleaning toilets. You're crazy, man. You're crazy. Come on. Tommy. This is gonna cost me a fortune, man. I know it. Alright. So who's Thomas McNeal? Right here. Here you go. We're open 24 hours. You call me later, I'll give you an estimate. Alright. So where are the keys? - I left them in the ignition. - Alright. So what's the move? We're going to the subway or what? Hey! Pay the fare! You over there! The fare ain't fair, Uncle Tom! Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! OK, fellas, let's see some I.D. What a night. Is there something funny? You guys, cut it out! You find this amusing? Thomas McNeal. Yeah. What's your profession? I'm an actor. Can't you tell? He's acting like he's terrified. Yo, Vinny, man. Stop that shit. Damn! I have in my hand an I.D. card with your picture on it... but it says Fernando Cuevas. So? So your friend over here just called you Vinny. So that's a nickname, that's all. What's your nationality? I'm Puerto Rican, man. Oh, my God! I can't believe it! I never thought I'd live to hear you say that. Why your friends call you Vinny? It's a nickname, that's all. From Fernando to Vinny? Why isn't it something like Furman or fur ball? It's Vinny, that's all. Is he telling the truth? I ain't say nothin'. I don't know nothin'. I asked you a question! Why do you call him Vinny if his name is Fernando? He thinks he's Italian. Thinks he's Italian? So, you think you're Italian? Let me tell you something. I'm Italian, OK? You see that name? Saninelli? I'm Italian... and I'm gonna tell you something. No matter what you do, no matter what you say... you will never be Italian. Scum like you could never be in the same company as me. Now I'm gonna write you a summons. I got to tell you. It's so easy to be a tough guy... when you got a gun on one side and a badge on the other. But I'm gonna tell you something, and I mean this. They're nothing but a bunch of punks to me. I tell you what. They're nothing but a bunch of thugs... with a license, and I hate 'em. I swear to God, I hate cops. I fucking hate cops. Me, too. Could you pass me the ketchup there, Fernando Cuevas? You think you're funny? You penniless motherfucker. Come on, y'all. Let's leave fur ball alone. You gonna gang up on me and shit? Anybody want to donate to the United Negro-- Would you mind-- Don't encourage him. The guy needs some money. What'd I tell you about letting your father out? Please. Let's go. I just wanted something to eat. See that there? That there is your future. What? That's right. You keep up with that putting me down thing... and then your white man, black man thing... and they oppress me. You keep that up, that's exactly the way you're gonna wind up. You think that shit's funny? Come on. He's just goofing on you 'cause you goofed on him. I can't laugh that shit off. You think that shit is funny? You think I like being this way? You think I like being scared... not knowing if I'm gonna make it through the week? That's not funny. Don't play like that. What is it with you? What is it? Huh? What? What? What is it with you? You feel like there's this beam of light... that shines on you from God, and then the rest of us... we're all just fucked up? Is that what you feel? I feel that way sometimes. You're an asshole. Your mother's an asshole. You're the fucking asshole. Your whole family's a fucking asshole! Menu? No, thanks. Two coffees. I'm so tired. I've been working all day. I know. I'm so glad it's over. We should go play pool. I love watching you play. You're really good at it. I just like to show off. That's why. Hey, how you doing? So, being that... you're the most beautiful woman sitting at this table... you know what I'm gonna do for you? I'm gonna devote all my time and attention just to you. Hey, hey. Now that I got rid of her, you and I can talk... because you're the one I was really eyeing anyway. No, thanks. I have herpes. Wait! Nonoxynol-9... knock that shit right out. He a friend of yours? Not really. That's good to know, 'cause he's a real asshole. You know what? I just tried telling him that a few minutes ago... but he wouldn't believe me. I guess we think alike. Maybe... or just maybe the whole world thinks he's an asshole. What's your name? - What? - Do you have a name? My name is Johnny. I'm Luna. It's nice to meet you. You look kind of familiar to me. Haven't I seen you in here before? I doubt that. Didn't I see you come in here once with your girlfriend? I doubt that, too. So you don't have a girlfriend. No, not really. Look... Lila and I are gonna go shoot some pool down the street. Want to come? I gotta ask my friends-- just talk to my friends. Look, Johnny... I don't want to marry you. I just want to play pool with you. Come on. So, tell me your life story, Johnny. You want to know my life story? My life story. There's actually not much to tell at all, actually. Do you like girls? I like girls. I like girls a lot. I like girls. Why do you got to ask that for? It's a start. You're really good at this. I didn't invite you to play so you could watch me lose. I paid for half my college tuition... by beating the pants off guys who thought they were hot shit. I see. You're a college girl. That's right. I know a lot of people who said that college... really isn't all that it's hyped up to be. They even actually said it's a big waste of time--serious. What idiots told you that? Well... those idiots over there. You know you're perpetrating a fraud, right? Excuse me? You're perpetrating a fraud. You are what I call a sad excuse for a fine African sister. And what's that supposed to mean? What I mean is you're dressing like a white girl... you're hanging out with this white girl... and you even smell like a white person. You trying to call me an Uncle Tom? I'm calling you Aunt Tomini. You got a lot of balls. You're saying that 'cause I'm black, right? If I was a white guy, I'd be speaking my mind. Because I'm black, got to have big balls. I want you to realise... that there's something very, very strange... going on here tonight-- something very strange. Fucking telling me. Look at the situation. Out of this whole damn stuck-up place... you got two girls who could speak English. One of them is talking to Johnny... and the other one's talking to Willie. There's something strange going on here. Fuck these people. Where are you from? All over. I'm an army brat. My dad was in the service, so we travelled around a lot. Where? Germany, France... Hawaii. Wow! That's great. Teaches you there's this big beautiful world out there... just waiting for you to take a bite out of it. You know what I mean? No, I don't know. Tell me. You got a lot of nerve coming up to me... someone you don't even know, pointing your damn finger... and you ain't done shit to help yourself and nobody else. Wait a minute! Have you gone to any demonstrations? - No, but-- - Have you signed any petitions? I didn't have a pen, so I didn't-- Have you even bothered to get off your lazy ass... and join any organisations? Never did. But-- Tell me. Do you vote? No. I missed this year 'cause Dinkins wasn't running. I'll catch-- And you're gonna tell me I'm perpetrating a fraud? You're the one that's perpetrating a fraud. I know what this place needs, a jammie. Do a jammie? Right here? - Right now? - Yeah. As usual, I'm winning. Must feel great to always win. Yeah, it feels great. I need something like that. I need something that every time I did it, I won. You know what I think? I think everybody's got that. You just got to open up and allow yourself to find it. Go ahead. What are you afraid of? You fucked my wife! You son of a bitch! You fucked my wife. How dare you speak to me in such an outrageous-- Don't fucking point at me! Come on, you motherfucker! - Come on. Come on! - You bastard! What is going on? Let's go out for a little bit. What? Get the fuck out of here! What? What? That's the guy! He fucked your wife! I was there! And when he was done, I fucked her. Well, I guess I'll have to give you my number... or else we'll never finish the game. You would've won anyway. You were just very good at it. Never know. Your luck might change. Here. Why don't we...be friends? How's that sound? Sounds nice. Sounds very, very nice. Please make sure you call the right number. Oh, yeah. I won't call the wrong number, I promise you. I will never forgive you for leaving me in there... with those idiots--never! I'm sorry! There's no excuse for this-- none. Hey, hey... did you ever figure out where you saw me before? Huh? Remember you said that I looked familiar to you? What am I? A piece of gum? I've never seen you before. See, forget it. Now you still... Lala, come on! Don't go home. Oh, shit! Did you see me in there? I was brilliant, man. Excellent. What? You sucked. What was all that Shakespeare shit? All that wither, hither, yonder bullshit? You sucked! You wouldn't know the difference between a good or bad actor. But I know the difference between a bad actor... and an actor that sucked. Hey, Johnny... what happened with that chick? She's gonna be my friend. She gonna be a what? She's gonna be my friend. Get out of here! Friend? Fucking... You see, a good actor reacts to a situation. Did you see my eyes when we were in there? The way they kind of twitched around when I was in the moment? Your actin' sucks. Your shit is fake. Fuck you. Your mama's fake. I almost had a part in "Rain Man." Did you almost have a part in "Rain Man?" No. I almost played a waiter in "Rain Man." By now I'd be famous. People'd be stoppin' me in the streets going... "Oh, shit. Ain't that the brother... who played the waiter in 'Rain Man'?" Vanessa. Vanessa! Yo, relax. Be cool. - Tommy! - Don't do it! Be mature about it, man. Tommy? Yo, who the hell is this guy, baby? Baby? Baby? Tommy, stop it! You're supposed to be sick. You look really sick. Yo, what is it? Just leave her alone, alright? I'm alright. Y'all can let me go. Vanessa... Can we go somewhere and talk about this? Look, let me have a minute with him. You know this guy? Yeah. If there's something going on, why don't you just tell me? Come on, please? Just let me talk to him. Go ahead. If you want me, I'll be on the corner. Vanessa, I just-- I mean, I don't understand. I come out... Guys, me and Vanessa would like to talk. Absolutely. - Sorry, man. - Sorry about that. Look, Vanessa, I mean, make me understand, alright? Guys, can we have some privacy? Let's go in this building over here. Vanessa, I don't understand. I mean, I know I cared about you. I don't know what's happened. You're not being fair. Man, I've been totally faithful to you. Look, Tommy, I'm not trying to be a bitch. She's a bitch. I really like Frederick. Frederick? I'm sorry. Really. Oh, shit! It'll take some time, but you'll get over it. We always do. Don't worry about it. All you gotta do is just go home, you relax... you chill out for a little while. Home? Wait a second, man. That's the last thing he needs to do. He's gotta do the exact opposite. You gotta get out there, see there's more women... pretty women, too, man... because that Vanessa was nothing to scream at. That's not what he needs. What you need, man, is-- Look, if anybody knows about depression, it's me. How do you know what he needs? You don't know what he needs. You ain't never been through what he's been through. 'Cause you ain't never had a girl in your life! So why you gonna go back into that shit again? That's right, man. Look at you tonight... over there in that pool hall with that girl. She looked like she was ready to sit on your face. You talkin' about she's gonna be your friend. Get the fuck outta here. You wouldn't know what to do with a girl... if she was standin' in front of you naked. See, now, I know all about women. I've been that route... and I know what Tommy's goin' through. Right. You think you know what Tommy's going through... but you never cared for any of them... so you have no idea what Tommy's going though. You think I've always been like this, bro? Yeah. No way, bro. I used to fall head over heels over women... every time. You know what I got in return? Hurt...every time. No more of that shit. Those days are over. Shit. I used to end up lookin' all pitiful... like Tommy over here and shit. Bartender, get my pitiful ass another beer. You don't need all that. Come on. Let me take you home. Let's get out of here. Why don't you let the guy finish his drink? What are you worried about? Let the boy finish his drink. - Let's go home, man. - Let him finish his beer. We going dancin'. It's 3:00 in the morning. Fuck dancing. Let's just go home. Dude, Willie's right. Come on, let's go. Let's get out of here. Shut up! If you guys wanna go home, then go home! This is my moment! I'm the one that's upset here. My girlfriend leaves me, my car gets wrecked. I'm the one that needs my friends to console me. This is my moment. Mine. Would y'all give me my fuckin' moment... without one stupid fight? He's right. He's right. This is Tommy's moment. We forgot about that. He's the guy who's feelin' all depressed. He's the guy who's feelin' all bad and shit... and we're over here thinkin' about what we wanted. We should want to do whatever Tommy wants to do. I guess so. Sure, man. Tommy, Tommy... Come here. What? You're right. This is your moment. Whatever you want to do. What do you want to do? You want to go home to an empty bed... feelin' sorry for yourself, all miserable... depressed? Or you wanna go out to a club, meet a new girl... fuck the shit out of her... and forget about Vanessa's stink hole ass? What do you wanna do? I wanna get me some pussy. What's happening? What's the cover charge tonight? - All of you guys are together? - We're together. I wanna see three pieces of I.D. from everybody. Three pieces of I.D.? Who carries 3 pieces of I.D.? Word, man. We got busted by the cops. We didn't need but one piece of I.D. Alright, look, fellas. You're blockin' the door. Now please leave. This is racist bullshit! I might have three pieces of I.D. What do you guys have? You can have a signed statement from God. You're not gettin' in this place tonight. Let's see. I got three pieces of I.D. right here. You want to check 'em out? None of those are valid I.D. What are you talkin' about, they're not valid? They're valid. This is racist fuckin' bullshit. - Come on. Let's go. - I'm not gonna stand for this. I'm not going for this no more. This is fuckin' racist bullshit! You better put this dog back on his leash before I hurt him. Fuck you and your fuckin' club! I'm organising a rally... and I'm fuckin' callin' Al Sharpton tomorrow! Get the hell outta here. Get him outta here, will you? I'm organising a rally! I'm marchin'! I'm marchin' all over your fuckin' head! - Get off me, man! - Take it easy, bro! I'm serious. I'm calling Fat-ass Al right now. - Where's the phone? - Yo, chill out, man. Somebody give me a quarter. I ain't got no money. Psst! Come here, man. Come on. You guys want to get into the club tonight? Yeah. I can get you in. I know a way. Oh, yeah? How? It'll cost you $5.00 apiece. Come on, guys. Let's go. It'll cost you eighteen at the door, my brother. And that's if they let you in at all. But how can we be sure that your way's gonna work? I give back your money. I'm not a crook. Just a businessman. Everybody, give up five. Fellas... I hear you. I got it. Let's go party. Come on. Now, what is this? You guys want to get in or not? Yeah. Damn. Look at all this rust. Man. Go ahead. - In there? - Go ahead in there. Where's the Rasta man? I don't know. I hear some music. Hold on. You hear it? Come on. Alright! Word, man. Let's have a good time. Fuck a good time. I want some pussy. Let's have fun this time. Yo, man, fuck fun. I want some pussy. That's my boy. Come on. Let's go. Excuse me. I was just standing right over there. I took one look at you... and I thought, "What a beautiful woman"... but it was more than that. It was style. You're looking quite lovely tonight. Would you care to dance? No, thank you. And I'm thinking you're the only person... that I'd even waste my time talking to. Because beauty is anybody, but style is-- Excuse me. Excuse me. I was just standing right over there... and I took one look at you, and I... Would you like to join me in a dance, sweetheart? No, thank you. A screwdriver, and I want a Tom Collins. Fifteen dollars. Excuse me? Fifteen dollars. Fifteen dollars for two drinks? Damn. What do they put in there? Diamonds and shit? You want the drinks or not? How do you expect a poor man to pay for drinks like this? That's class discrimination. That's appropriate. You look like you have no class. I guess you think I want to dance with you. Guess what, big head, I wouldn't dance with you... even if you didn't look like a sabre-toothed tiger, bitch! What do you think about that? Shit. Fuckin' movie star. Now you know you gotta give me a dance. Sure. Love to. Come on. OK, bye. Rasta man. What's happenin'? How you doin', man? Not too good. I was hoping I could get my car back... so I could drive the fellows home tonight. Well, where you live? Go! Get 'em! Yeah! Get it, Vinny! Motherfucker! - Get off her. - Get out of here. What the fuck you doing? What the fuck is the matter with you? You want me to kick your ass or what? Come on! Kick my fuckin' ass! What are you doing? What the fuck am I doing? What the fuck are you doing? What are you talking about? You don't own me! What the fuck is the matter with you? You want me to kick your ass, motherfucker? Fuck you, man! Fuck all of you! You motherfucker! Come on. Get off me, man! You know who's responsible for this? I said get the fuck off me! - Cool out! - Get off me! I ain't lettin' you go till you calm the fuck down. - Chill out! - Alright. I'm OK. You alright? I'm fine. Let me go. I'm OK. Thanks a lot. I'm alright. Thanks. Johnny, come here. Hey, come here. Stay away from me. I'm not playin' with you. What was that shit all about? I'm talkin' to you, bro! What was that all about? I'm talkin' to you! The girl you were dancing with? That's the girl I'm crazy about! She's the girl I cared about. Leave me the fuck alone. I'm really angry. Leave me the fuck alone. That's the girl you were crazy about? Fuckin' girl works for X-rated movies. You can see her fuckin' guys for twenty-five cents. Least she could do is charge a full dollar! Why don't you go back and dance with her? I don't need her. You can have her. Leave me the fuck alone! Now you saying that shit after you fucked up my whole night! Why don't we just take the whole fuckin' night... and keep recycling that shit over and over again! Don't mean nothin' to you. 'Cause I deserve a lot fuckin' better... but you don't, motherfucker! I'll tell you what you deserve, motherfucker. Get off me, man! What you deserve is a fuckin' kick in the ass. Who the fuck do you think you are? What? Do you think you're better than me? You're just a fuckin' piece of shit! You're just like the fuckin' rest of us, man. You're just a fuckin' piece of shit! - What are you afraid of? - Not you, Fernando! You motherfucker. Come here! Ten dollars, my brother. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't believe Johnny and Vinny... just left us in that club all by ourselves. - What's happenin'? - What's up? Yo, fellas, what'll it be? Let me get a ham and egg on a roll. Make that to go. I'll have a... Yo, Tom, man... You know. I don't know. What? You not gonna put me down? Didn't you just see me give the Rasta ten dollars? You didn't put nothing in that. I've been paying for shit for you all night. You got it, you got it. How do you think I get it? I work for it! So what you saying? You want me to go work for the white man? You think the white man's the only man hiring? You give me no consideration. I gotta pay rent. I gotta get my damn car fixed. I'm an actor. I gotta get my head shots. I can't afford to be paying for you every week. I suggest you forget about that actin' shit... 'cause you ain't got no real talent anyway. With that money you could buy me an egg sandwich. What kind of shit is that to say? What kind of friend are you? You hang out with me just to bum money... then you tell me I can't act? You and Vinny are nothing but a bunch of users. Who needs this shit? Fuck all y'all. Who needs a friend like you? You need a friend like me... so I can teach you how to be a real black man. 'Cause I knew your name was Tom for a reason. You are just a bum, a fuckin' bum. I'm sick and tired of your phoney militant ass. I'm sick of Vinny's fuckin' put-downs. And if Johnny wants to be my friend, that's fine. But if he doesn't, then fuck him, too. 'Cause I'm a grown man. I can stand on my own two feet. Fuckin' bum! I'm a bum? Fuck you and your fake actor bullshit! Let me tell you something. I'm gonna fuckin' make it. You hear me? I'm gonna make it. And if by some small chance I don't make it... then I'm gonna die trying. Which is more than I can say about anything... you've ever done in your life, motherfucker. Fuck you! You ain't gonna make shit! Just a piece of shit like the rest of us! Shit! Excuse me. Yo, yo, baby, come here. I want to talk to you for a second. You're lookin' mighty good this morning... but it's more than that. You know what you got? You got style. Really. I mean, even your dog's got style. See, that's why I wouldn't bother to talk... Captioning made possible by New Line Home Entertainment
