TRUDY: When I was a child, I dreamed I lived in a forest and was queen of the animals. I loved that world where the creatures ran wild and only I could tame them, where they taught me their secret language and only I could hear it. It didn't matter that I grew up. I refused to surrender my crown. Now, when people ask my husband, the doctor, about me, I think what they're really asking is, "Is she still crazy?" Well, tell them, "Yes." Tell them that I filled your life with folly. Tell them I haven't finished dreaming and I never will. (WHISTLE BLOWING) (CROWD CHATTERING) Here we are. Three, please. How many? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Hey! Sit down! WOMAN: Shh! Shush yourself! WOMAN: Usher! This man is bothering... Me? Talk to her! (SCREECHING) (AUDIENCE GASPING) (CHIMP GIBBERING) Miss? Mrs. Mrs. Gertrude Lintz. What are these little... Apes. Just over from Africa. This is Maggie Klein and this dashing fellow is called Joe Mende, named after the Mende tribe. (WHISPERING) Cannibals. Come on, let's watch the movie. Turn around, Maggie. (CHITTERING) (CHIMP CHITTERING) (LAUGHING) (GASPS) (CHIMPS CHITTERING) (CAR HORN HONKING) (CHUCKLES) Let me take your hat. Thank you, Joe. Go ahead, Joe. Go on. Go on. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SHOUTING BIRD CALLS) (DOGS BARKING) (WHINNIES) (SQUAWKING) (SQUAWKING LOUDLY) (CHIRPING) (SQUEAKING) (LOUDLY) Aah-ooh! (MEOWING) (CHIRPING) (GRUNTS) (CLUCKING) Mmm-hmm. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Dr. Lintz. Hang on. Trudy! TRUDY: Oh, Bill, are you here? No, I'm due at the hospital. The phone's for you. Have you seen Joe and Maggie? Yeah, they're up here. They're pretending to look at me through binoculars. (LAUGHING) Opera glasses. They saw it at the movies. Oh, yeah. How stupid of me. Send them down, sweetheart. Skedaddle. Don't forget the phone. I won't. Thanks. (CHITTERING) (GIBBERING) (BLOWS RASPBERRY) Go on, you two. Get outta my kitchen. It's not suppertime. (BEATER WHIRRING) (CHIMPS CHITTERING) Didn't I tell you? (IMITATING CHIMP CHITTERS) (SQUAWKS RASPBERRY SOUND) Why they want all you all around? It's enough to drive a person to the nuthouse. Course, this place probably already is the nuthouse. (IMITATING BEATER) (CONTINUING MIMIC) (BEATER WHIRRING LOUDLY) How long has he been there? What have you done for him? Nothing. You aren't doing anything! All right. All right, I'm on my way. (HOOTING) (HOOTING) Dick. I won't be back until late tonight. Will you make sure Maggie and Joe get their supper and into bed on time? Yes, Mrs. Lintz. Ah, wish me luck. Where are you going? Philadelphia. Philadelphia? Yeah. (GEAR GRINDS) (WHEEZING) TRUDY: Where is his mother? No gorilla has ever survived captivity without its mother. Not one. How did you expect him to? We've had other firsts here. Oh. Of course you have. And I'm sure you're very proud of yourselves. What are you doing? Taking him home. (WHEEZING) This is double pneumonia. Very far advanced. How far is very far? Let's see if the heat lamp helps him any. He can't die. Not every baby gorilla can die the instant people get a hold of it. (WHISPERS) Here. I don't think he can eat, sweetheart. Mmm. Well, if you don't eat, how will I ever see your bright eyes, hmm? Beautiful little Buddy. You named him. Buddha. But right away he was Buddy. Why did you do that? You know it'll only make it harder when he... Just try, Buddy. Come on. Just try. That's perfect, Maggie. You're getting better at that every day. Isn't she, Joe? Hmm? You ready for breakfast? (GIBBERING) (SOFTLY) Wait. Maggie, no. Maggie. Maggie. Maggie, come on. There's a sick baby in there. (SOFT SNORING) He all right? (CLICKS TONGUE) (SIGHS) I'll go warm the milk. (SQUAWKING) Go on, you two, get out of my kitchen! (BOTH SQUEALING) Hey, hey! Now, what's going on? Maggie. (SQUAWKING) Go on! Get out of my kitchen! Maggie! What are you doing? Maggie! (CHIMP-LIKE GRUNTING) (SHRIEKING) DICK: Joe! (CHARLIE SQUAWKING) Maggie, don't go up there. (GASPS) Joe! Uh... (SQUAWKING) Uh-oh. Joe! (GASPS) TRUDY: Put that down! Maggie! Shame on you! (RATTLE SHAKING) (MOCK WAILING) Maggie! Whoo-oo-oo! Here comes the bogeyman. (RATTLING CONTINUES) (MOCKING GASPS) Joe! Here comes the bogeyman. (SHRIEKING) (GHOSTLY WAILING) (SHRIEKING) (WHIMPERING) (LOW MOANING) What in the world can I do for you? DICK: Come on, push up. Okay, Joe. Push up. Up. Good boy. Maggie, come on. Up, up, up. (DISGUSTED SIGH) Good. Up. Up. That's ridiculous. Up you go. Up, up. Good girl! Anything useful? Oh, not so far. There's almost no information. But at least this Professor Spatz has been to the Congo. Finally something by someone who's actually seen gorillas with his own eyes. (SIGHS) No, no, stay here awhile. There's no change. We've done everything humanly possible. Except pull him out of it. As long as he's still breathing, we've got to keep trying. Do you know I've figured out what it is, Trudy? You have to save this gorilla so we finally have someone in the house who can wear my hand-me-downs. (LAUGHING) Bill! Oh, good. I can still make you laugh. Oh! Yeah, that's it. You hold on tight. (LABORED BREATHING) (BREATHING STOPS) TRUDY: Buddy looked up at me with such trust, but I didn't know anything. I didn't know how to raise a baby gorilla. So, I went for advice to that most dangerous of species, the expert. Every detail is perfect. Look at the teeth. TRUDY: Where did you get these? They're specimens I collected myself. They're from all over the world. Mrs. Lintz, my dear, certainly you have questions for me. I need information, Professor. I have a gorilla living in my house. What do they eat? How do they groom themselves? When do the mothers wean their young? What are their daily habits? But most of all, what is their play like? (SMUG CHUCKLE) My dear woman, the gorilla is an unfathomable mystery. He's completely taciturn. He's humorless, introverted, unresponsive. He utterly lacks what we would call "imaginative invention." May I ask how long you actually spent with them in the jungle? Ten astonishing days. You're kidding. I would never jest about something like that. Survival in the Congo is not to be taken lightly, Mrs. Lintz. No, I'm sure. Well, thank you for your time, Professor Spatz. But Mrs. Lintz, what do you intend on doing with your gorilla? I'll raise him the same way I raised my chimps. Which is? As far as possible like human children. Oh! That's preposterous! Revolutionary as it might seem to you, I have encountered no limits or even real difficulties. When they catch cold, do you have any idea what they need? Chicken soup. Hmm. Buddy, Buddy, Buddy, Buddy, Buddy! Whoo! (GRUNTING) Take a little bite. Come on, just a little bite. Open your mouth. Come on. Oh, Mrs. Lintz, thank heaven you're back. What is it? He won't eat, not for anything. Oh, what do you mean? Of course he will. Here, here, here. Hmm. EMMA: I got to chew it for him? Well, it's the only way he eats. You know that. I got enough to do without chewing up food for monkeys. Come here, Buddy. (SIGHING) I missed you. Yes. Mmm. (CHUCKLING) Oh, that's a nice hug. That's a nice hug. Oh, Buddy. Let me see you. Let me see you. (PANICKED SQUEAL) (LAUGHS) Oh. Okay. Okay. All right, here we go. Here, let me just take off my coat. (SQUEALING) Oh, my! Buddy! (CHUCKLES) Oh! Taciturn, honestly. Buddy. Then you must keep yourself calm. Yes, that is easy for me to say. Mmm-hmm. Well, where is his hand now, exactly? Really. Look here. (CLEARS THROAT) (SHRIEKING) Buddy, please, I'm burning up, for heaven sakes. Buddy, what are you... I'd recommend two aspirins. TRUDY: (SCREAMING) Bill! No, not for him. For you. Well, plenty of butter and a gentle pull should fix that. (BUDDY SHRIEKS) TRUDY: Bill! No, I think he's been punished enough, don't you? (SIGHS) Bill! Yes, just natural curiosity about his body. Certainly. TRUDY: Emma! No, just trust your instincts. You're a very good... You're a very able mother, Mrs. Warner. Goodbye. Goodbye. (BUDDY SHRIEKING) Have mercy! DICK: Don't. Now look, you're making the baby cry! Stop it! Joe, please. Maggie, let go. Bend back his fingers, Emma. Bend back his fingers? He might bite me! Just try it. We don't know that he'll bite. We don't know that he won't either! Will you at least get Joe off my leg? DICK: Joe, come on, let go! Oh! Help! Joe, please don't do that! Look at the baby's crying. Maggie... (SHRIEKING CONTINUES) Well! I suppose Buddy found exactly what he wants. What? A warm, comfortable mother. (SARCASTIC LAUGH) A very warm, very uncomfortable mother. No, Joe! Maggie, will you stop screaming? He will let go. He's bound to. He's bound to let go sometime. Oh, you're so funny, darling, sometimes. Oh. Oh! Night, Trudy. Good night, Bill. (BUDDY GURGLING) Night, Buddy. Very funny. (SIGHING) (WHISPERING) Bill. Bill. (SIGHING) Oh, thank you. (RELIEVED SIGH) (CHUCKLES) (GIGGLING) (HAPPY GRUNTING) Oh, no, you don't! We're not going through that again. (LAUGHS) Did I tell you we have two more chimps coming today? They're from a zoo, just like you. Yes. Yes. Dick found them. Yes. We'll move the chimps into their own building and then we'll move you into the sunroom. Oh, yes. It'll be good for you. Yeah. Here we go, bright eyes. (TOILET FLUSHING) Maggie? Joe? What're you... (CHITTERING) Maggie! You're a very bad girl. You can forget your bath for today. Come on up here. Go to your room. (WHINES) Go on. (MAGGIE SQUEALING) (SNICKERING) Joe. Here we go. Ah, here we go. There. All right. Are you ready for your first bath? Hmm? (GRUNTS) All right. (UNEASY GRUNTING) (PANICKED SQUEALING) Whoa! Buddy! All right, okay! (LAUGHING) All right, Buddy! There now. That's much better. Okay, then. Cheer up, wee man. (MEOWING) (CHITTERING) There. I didn't know you don't like water. (SOFT GRUNTING) There you go. Got your nose. I got your nose a little bit. Yes, I do. (BOTH GRUNTING EXCITEDLY) (HUMMING SOFTLY) (GRUNTING MELODICALLY) That's it! (LILTING CONTINUES) Ooh, that's pretty. (DOG BARKING) Venus, remember your manners. Good dog. Come on, Adonis. (IMITATING MEOW) (CAT MEOWS) Hello, Joe. (JOE SCREECHES) Oh, no, Joe. He's still too little for you play with. Come on Stay in line. Good dogs. (MEOWS) (SQUEALING) Oh! Joe. (SQUAWKING) Kitty, kitty, kitty! (MEOWING) (ALL BARKING) (SQUEALS) (PANTING) DICK: Whoa! (ANIMALS CLAMORING) Heel! (IMITATING MEOW) What... DICK: I said, heel! Uh-oh. Aah! Ooh! Oh, Dick! Heel! Sit! All of you, down! (SCREECHING) Down. Oh, don't worry, Buddy. You can make friends with them. (SQUEALING) (SNORTING) (SPITS) Buddy! (GRUNTS) What do you think you're up to? Uh-uh. Buddy, no! Shame on you! (WHIMPERING) (PITIFUL MOANING) Buddy, Buddy, Buddy. Shh. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. (CHITTERING) No, no, you two. Not now. (GRUNTS) Come on, Joe. Captain Jiggs. Come on. (MOANING CONTINUES) I don't just belong to you, you know. Well. Maybe I do. Don't worry. She didn't mean it. I know what'll cheer you up. Look. Here's a coin. It's okay. It's only a coin. This is magic. Ready? It's in the air, in the air. It's going in the hand. It's in the hand. Look what's in there. It's gone! It's gone! Do you know where it is? (SNAPS FINGERS) It was in Joe's ear! That's magic. TRUDY: Oh, you can walk on two feet, Buddy. You know you can. (CRASHING) Try. Just try. Come on, just try, Buddy. Oh! Trudy, do you think you'll be here by dessert? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm coming. Don't know what she's missing, does she? You know, if I could just get his mind off his fear, he'd be walking now. You know what? Wait a minute. Give me a couple of those bananas. You want some of that? No, no, have some of this. With your cranberry sauce, go on. Up you go. There. Hold these right under your arms and hold tight. Lettuce? Here we go. There. All right, now. (GROANS) What, Buddy? What's wrong? Oh, it's wilted. Hmm, you'll keep that green grocer honest yet, won't you? Is the celery fresh? I hope so. Oh, all right. Here. Here we go. All right. All right, go on. Go to the dining room. No, no, don't eat it. Don't eat it. Go to the dining room. Whoo-hoo! There you have it! Walking! (SLURPING) Buddy, hold your fork like... Hold your fork like this. Trudy. There you go. Yes? Sorry. Buddy! Your foot goes on the floor. (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) Darling, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... Before we know it, he is gonna be huge. Well, I imagine you know how I feel about that. Yes, well, I'm not a gorilla. Don't underestimate yourself, darling. You know you're capable of almost anything. Besides, Buddy's a perfect gentleman. Not with your foot, Buddy. Sweetheart, do you know anyone offhand who has a full-grown gorilla in their house? No. But I have my suspicions about that new fellow down at the drugstore. Oh. All right, Buddy. All right. Now, take your plate to Emma. She'll give you dessert. Okay. (GRUNTING) TRUDY: And so, my sweet Buddy grew and grew. A hundred pounds a year. His massive size and strength always competing with his sensitivity and grace. (CHITTERING) (WHIMPERING) Buddy. Oh, it's all right, Buddy. It's all right. Night-night, Skippy. Snuggle up, Captain Jiggs. It's cold out there. Night, Joe. Bedtime, Maggie. Sweet dreams, Maggie. (CHITTERING) (GRUNTING) Oh, Buddy! Who let you out, hmm? It was that bad Maggie, wasn't it? Come on, Buddy. All right. Ready to go, Trudy? Almost. I'll warm up the car. All right. I'll be out in a minute. Make sure you leave the blanket for him at the foot of his bed in case he needs it during the night. Yes, I know. Bye-bye. Stay with me. Because he prefers the blanket to the quilt. I know. And he likes you to fluff his pillow. Yes, I know that, Mrs. Lintz. Come on, Buddy. Good boy. Oh! And, uh, don't forget to leave on a couple of lights, because one's not enough. (GRUNTING) Yes, Mrs. Lintz, I know all the particulars. All right. Come on, now, good boy. Easy, boy. Stay with me, Buddy. Oh, Dick, remember, a little snack around 9:00. Yes. I think it would be best if you went now, Mrs. Lintz. Yes, all right. Night-night, Buddy. Look. See? See, she's gone. There, now. It's okay, big man. (SAD GRUNTING) Good boy. (FRUSTRATED GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) (CONTENTED GRUNTING) (LAUGHING) Oh, Bill. Oh, my feet are killing me. That's what you get for dancing on the table. Listen, next time we're invited to one of these gala shindigs, would you remind me how much I hate them? Maybe. Don't you think it does you good to get out? No. People are such bores. Oh, thank you very much. (LAUGHS) (GRUNTING) (LAUGHING) Red's my favorite color too, Buddy. (HONKING) (CHITTERING) (HONKING CONTINUES) (CHITTERING) (BUDDY GRUNTING) Easy, Buddy. You've cleaned enough right there. Better move along before you scrub all the linoleum off the floor. (GRUNTS) (SQUAWKING) Easy, Buddy. The only useful one out the whole bunch. How'd you like to learn how to cook? (GRUNTS) Jane Aldrich, uh, tells me that your monkeys wear clothes all the time. They're apes. Chimps and gorillas are apes, not monkeys. Oh. Well, last I heard, you raised dogs and competed in dog shows. Oh, Westminster, Bunny. She's won five times, five consecutive years. No one's broken that record, have they? No, no they haven't. I also understand that these, uh, little fellows brush their teeth and, uh, wash their faces? Jane also told me that they even say their prayers at night. (CHUCKLES) Is it all right for him to... Oh, Joe. Yes, well, when they're clean and dressed, they're always under better control. They're mentally stimulated and they're proud of themselves, just as we are. JOE: Do you realize what you have accomplished, Mrs. Lintz? You are the missing link. (TRUDY LAUGHS) TRUDY: Oh, Mr. Bowman, there's such a long way to go. But I believe I may have blundered on enough to keep the scientists picking up after me for a good long while. The difference between chimps and gorillas, for instance, is absolutely fascinating. Why, when Maggie here got her first Kiddie Kar... Her first Kiddie Kar? Yes, well, she didn't know what in the world to make of it. Oh, Mrs. Lintz. The World's Fair needs them. You cannot refuse us. You must bring them to Chicago. Our organizers have combed the globe, gathering the fruits of humanity's genius. You belong there. You must be there. It is not by accident that we've called it, "The Century of Progress Exposition." The century of progress. Why, it wouldn't be complete without you, and what better example of progress than you and your apes. (JOE AND TRUDY CHUCKLING) Oh, aren't these the most fantastic times we live in? Oh, yes. Yes, they are, Mr. Bowman. (CHUCKLES) They are. Whoo, Buddy! (GRUNTS) (SNORTING) Oh, my God! May I have a bite of your banana, Buddy? Oh, it looks delicious. Thank you. Would you? (BOTH CHUCKLING) No, no, thank you. Hmm. None of the chimps will do that. Not one of them will share food with me. Buddy, open your mouth. (TRUDY CHUCKLES) Okay, let go now. You see? He's as gentle as a lamb. (GRUNTS) Then why is there a chain on his door? Oh, well. He doesn't know his own strength sometimes. (LAUGHS SHEEPISHLY) I'll think about the World's Fair, Mr. Bowman, and I'll let you know in a week or two. Thank you. Thank you very much. (LAUGHING UNEASILY) (CHARLIE LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) Don't you like them, Charlie? (CHARLIE LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) Shh! (SQUAWKS) It's definite. Mr. Bowman brought the contract this afternoon. We're off to Chicago in a month. Well, that's terrific. I only wish I could drop everything and come with you. Well, you can't do that to your patients. Yeah. Do we have any mustard? I'll get it. I'm just sorry I'm gonna miss you there in all your glory. Oh, well, my glory's here. The World's Fair is just an adventure. Oh, that looks delicious. Do me a favor, Trudy. Oh, a bigger glass? No. Don't take Buddy. Why not? 'Cause I don't think it's safe. Not for you, not for him, not for anybody. I honestly don't. Oh, horsefeathers. Tomato would be good on those, don't you think? Oh, knife! Look, indulge me. Just for a minute. How many people has Buddy ever been around at one time? I know we have more than one knife in this kitchen. You can answer the question with the fingers of one hand, Trudy. Do you know how many people go to these things? Millions. Well, we have our own pavilion. Millions of people won't be seeing Buddy all at once. Gertrude. Well, they won't! That's ridiculous! There's nothing to worry about. TRUDY: In the annals of fair-making, no show ever matched "The Century of Progress Exposition." Visitors swarmed to Chicago from everywhere. Eighty miles of free exhibits, spectacles and pageants were the wonder of the nation. The scene of new adventure, new knowledge, new experience. The chimps loved the crowds. They were natural performers. Ladies and gentlemen. We're very privileged to have you with us today. So come on in and enjoy the show! (APPLAUDING) (CHEERING) DICK: Thank you. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. (CHATTERING) (DRUMS AND HARMONICA PLAYING) (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING CONTINUES) I beg your pardon. I know that no one is permitted back here. Oh, no, don't worry, Father. His eyes are not the eyes of an animal. There isn't the slightest doubt, is there? No, there isn't, Father. (MUSIC PLAYING) (CROWD EXCLAIMS) (ALL EXCLAIM) (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) Whoo, Buddy! You'll have your turn on stage this afternoon. Okay? (TRAIN RUMBLING) (GRUNTING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (CHATTERING) (THUDS) (GRUNTING UNEASILY) (BELL RINGS) (HISSING) (SNORTING) (TRIBAL DRUMS PLAYING) You wait here. (ALL LAUGHING) (CHITTERING) (TRIBAL DRUMS CONTINUE) (GRUNTING) (APPLAUSE) TRUDY: Maggie? (CROWD SCREAMING) (NEIGHING) Gorilla's out! (ALL YELLING) (SCREAMING) (SNORTS) (PIANO PLAYING) (BUDDY WHIMPERING) (GRUNTS) (TRIBAL DRUMS INCREASING) MAN: Over there! (WHIMPERING) Buddy! Buddy! Buddy! Hey, wait, stop! Found him yet? No, not yet. I'd like to get out and walk. Yes, ma'am. (GRUNTS) MAN: Mrs. Lintz! Stop! Please, get back. Buddy? Buddy? Buddy. (SNIFFLING) (WHIMPERING) Oh, Buddy. (WHIMPERS) I was so worried about you. Where were you? Whoo, Buddy! Buddy! (LAUGHS) Buddy, let me down. Whoa. You let me go. (LAUGHING) Buddy, let me go. Mrs. Lintz? Oh, call my assistant, Dick Croner. And tell him to bring a truck down here. Right away. Buddy, let me down now. Oh, and I need a pan of milk. Okay. Oh, whoo! Buddy. (LAUGHS) Let me down. Oh, Buddy. Look what I've got for you. Milk. You must be starving. Dick's here, Buddy. Time to go. Yeah. (SIGHS) Oh, Buddy, they're all alike. You must have sat in every single one ten times by now. (GRUNTS) (BANGING ON DOORS) (WHIMPERING) (HORN HONKING) (DOGS BARKING) Oh, hello, Emma. CHARLIE: Hello, Emma! EMMA: Welcome home! (DOGS CONTINUE BARKING) (GIGGLES) Oh! Oh, come here, come here, come here, come here. (DOGS WHIMPERING) Hi. Oh, I missed you! I missed you! Hey, what kind of hello is that? We're still friends, aren't we? (SQUAWKING) Is he gonna be all right? He'll be fine, now that we're home. Come on. Oh, I'm so glad to see you. Thank you for not saying, "I told you so." Oh, did I forget? I told you so. Oh, I'm so happy to be back. TRUDY: Oh, that's beautiful. Look. TRUDY: And I was happy to be back. Now, more than anything else, I wanted a new start. For me, for all of us. But most of all, for Buddy. TRUDY: Buddy! Come and join us, Buddy! (PIANO PLAYING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (LAUGHTER) (WOMAN SCREAMING) (TRIBAL DRUMS PLAYING) It's freezing out there. EMMA: Miserable. I'll take Dr. Lintz's mail up to him in the study. I'll go brew some tea. (TRIBAL DRUMS CONTINUE) (TRUDY GASPS) (BUDDY ROARS) (TRUDY SCREAMS) TRUDY: Buddy! Buddy, stop it! No! (TOY RATTLES) Buddy! (BUDDY ROARS) TRUDY: No! (GRUNTING) I just can't stop thinking about it. Thank God she's all right. It's a nightmare, Joe. It's an absolute nightmare. Pour me another, would you? (WHEEZES) (GRUNTS) You ready to go in yet? Oh, just a little while longer. Ah, it's nice to be outside, isn't it? Oh, it's very nice. Trudy. Mmm-hmm? Have you decided what to do about Buddy? What are you saying? (GRUNTING) I'm sorry, Buddy. You know I can't let you out. Hey. Look what I've got for you. See? It's your favorite. It was my fault. I startled him. He didn't mean it. So you've said, over and over. Am I a bad person, Bill? Was I wrong? Should I have let him die when he was a baby? Would that have been kinder? Would that have been the right thing to do? No, sweetheart. I'd give anything to be able to send him home. That's what he needs. He belongs in the jungle. He belongs with his own kind. That's what he's aching for. Then why don't we? Because the truth is, is he wouldn't survive there. He wouldn't have a clue how. This is it. This is the only world he's ever known. He sleeps in a bed, Bill. He sleeps in a bed. Come on. Eat your dinner. We can't let him out of that cage, and you know it. Yes, we'll be able to. Why would you want to? What have you got to prove? What? I haven't lost control over him. You don't really believe that. I haven't. (SIGHS) (GRUNTING) (SOFT GRUNTS) Buddy. (BUDDY MOANS) (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) Look, Buddy. Poor Trudy. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING CONTINUES) Go sit in your chair, Buddy. Don't disobey me, Buddy. I can't have lost you, now go sit in your chair. (POT CLATTERS) Shame on you! Go sit in your chair now! (GROWLS) (GASPS) Oh. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (WHIMPERS) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (WHIMPERING CONTINUES) (DOOR OPENS) (BUDDY SNORTING) (WHIMPERING) (WHIMPERING CONTINUES) (WHISPERING) Buddy. Don't be afraid. It's just a storm. It's all right, Buddy. (WHIMPERING) It's all right. You're okay. Don't be afraid, Buddy. It's all right, Buddy. It's all right, Buddy. Easy. (WHIMPERS) That's it. That's it. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Don't be afraid. You'll be safe, Buddy, you'll be safe. Trudy's here. Trudy's here. It's okay, Buddy. You're all right, Buddy. It's all right, Buddy. Stairs. One at a time. Here we go. (SIGHS) Let go a little, Buddy. It's too tight. Buddy, you'll be fine. You're hurting me, Buddy. Buddy, let go. Let go, Buddy, please. Okay, that's better. Here we go. Good boy. Good boy. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Good boy. Okay, Buddy. All right, you're still with me. Look at this beautiful, perfect pear. Oh, yeah. Look at that. You can tell it's ripe, can't you? Smell. See, Buddy? Look. So good. It'll taste more gorgeous than any pear in the history of pears, Buddy. Good boy, Buddy! Buddy, look. Look at that. It's yours, Buddy. It's your pear for being such a good boy. There we go. That's a good boy, Buddy. Such a good boy. Here we go. Let's go. That's good, Buddy. There we go. Good Buddy. (GRUNTS) Buddy, wait! (GRUNTS) (GASPS) (GROWLING) (CLATTERING) (GROWLS) You mustn't shoot! Only if we have to, Mrs. Lintz. Now where is he? On my signal. Do you hear me? On my signal only! (SCREECHING) (BUDDY GRUNTING) (SCREECHING) (ROARS) (ROARING) CHARLIE: Oh, Buddy! Wonderful, Buddy. Wonderful. Oh. Wonderful. Oh. Oh, Buddy. (GRUNTS) (WHIMPERING) TRUDY: I knew Buddy could think, that he could love. What I hadn't wanted to face was how deeply he could hurt. Bill was right. Buddy didn't belong here anymore. But the heart is stubborn. The heart won't always listen. Thanks to you, here's a first the zoo can really be proud of, eh, Mrs. Lintz? Oh, well, I hope it works. Of course it'll work. It's excellent. Look at it, Tru. It's bound to inspire people. (SIGHS) We need to make sure we plant enough walnut trees. Buddy's crazy about walnuts. And I forgot the gooseberry bushes. Gosh, we need to get some gooseberry bushes. Yes, ma'am. Oh, and it's also time we got started on the jungle for the chimps. (ENGINE PUTTERING) Oh, he's here. I told you about this place, but I bet you didn't believe me, did you? There are caves to go into when it rains. And all kinds of trees, Buddy. Walnut trees.
