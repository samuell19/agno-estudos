Olle! - Hi! - It's been ages... - Didn't you hear us come? - Who's "us"? I've brought my nephew... Kevin! - Yes? - Come on! The stage looks great. Yes, he just works on the stage. He doesn't help me anymore. Just because I'll be using it? Kevin, this is Olle. Hello! - Are you in the karaoke show too? - No. He's on his favourite aunt's summer tour to have a bit of fun. Yes, we're going to have a ball. - Olle, show them the new parts! - But they're not ready yet. Come, Barbro! Olle! It's entirely different from last year! Kevin, come and see this... look! Wow! Light bulbs, I see... - What is it? - Nothing. Is everything alright? I was thinking...can you put a new song in the karaoke machine? Yes. - if you can, I'd like to sing. - Really? I've not quite decided yet... or rather, it's a secret. - OK. Tell me if you need anything. - Yes, I will. Could you take the water in for me? - Yes, but isn't Kevin in there? - Yes. I'm just bringing in the water. Oh! Have you got a bird? Yes, it's a bird. - Does it sit on your shoulder? - I don't know. Barbro stays here the same week every year... has done for 16 years. OK. I'm working on the stage. It has to be ready tomorrow. - Is the light-loop for your head? - No, it's just stage lighting. OK. Are you going to sing? No. I'm not singing any crappy karaoke hit. She's completely cuckoo, round the bend... Maybe she wants to get out and sit on a finger, or something. Well, let it out then. - What's her name? - Lucky Blue. Oh shit, the door! - Did it get out? - I don't know. Can't we shout a bit louder? You're not at all tempted to sing? I said no! I am 18 years old, after all. Oh my God! Such an old man! But Olle's going to sing. But Barbro... Aha! What are you going to sing then? What shall we do about Lucky Blue? An awfully queer bird, isn't she? She's scared of people. I don't know. You don't know? You let it out, didn't you? Answer my question! - He hadn't time to. - Did I ask you? No! I let it out, if you'd like to know. - Well, what wil I you sing? - Kjelle! Come on, let's go in. Here. Disgusting! Beer and chewing gum. - Is it true? Are you going to sing? - No. Really? No. Olle! Are you asleep? The electricity's gone in our place, Olle. Olle! Hi! - Wow, did we switch this on? - Y es. Fantastic! It's not so difficult. Just some bulbs plugged in series and other stuff... Plugged in series...? It's difficult to sleep when you've had a few drinks. Really? 56 seconds... 2 minutes... 2 minutes, my arse! No, that's enough. What are you laughing at? I don't know. Should I sing some Swedish evergreens too? Maybe they only want Elvis hits. You are Elvis, Kjelle. I don't think they m nd. But we must let the others have a go. Don't sing more than you did last year. No, no, of course not. Do you want it? Are you going in? - What about Olle? - He never says a word. No, that's what I mean. Yes, but isn't it a good idea, him working here? Yes of course it is, it's wonderful here. He could run the camping while I tour with you. Karaoke King and Queen, how's that? - Hi! - Hi! Shit! I was so drunk last night. - I've got such a hangover. - Yes. What are you up to? Are you going to work? Yes. I thought I'd ask you... .. if you'd help. - Now? - Yes. - No. - OK. Do you really want to sing Come To The Seashore? Forget it then. OK. - What will Olle sing tonight? - I don't know. Haven't you heard him sing? - We can all sing Elvis hits! - Kjelle... Did you slip? - Bloody hell, it's shit! - I didn't see any shit. Good God! - There's shit everywhere. - Shit? Yes, look here! Are you alright? Well, how do we sort this out? Hey... I was just thinking. I was wondering if you remembered. No, not just now. - No? - Yes, no. Are you deaf or what? You two are pals, aren't you? Yes, bosom pals. Must you laugh everything off? - Am I joking now? - No. Forget it then! I don't know if I've stirred up any trouble. I don't know what's happened between you and Kevin. These have just got to be fastened up here. It's going to be really lovely. One, two, one, two... Barbro, please turn round so I can concentrate. I can't work with lots of people around me. OK, Olle, when I do this, you begin. When I do it, not now! When I do it. I'm going to do it... - May I speak? - No! - Must you sing this song? - Y es. - Then you shall sing it. - It's hard if no one believes in me. OK, let's give it a miss. Olle, do you want to try yours? Sorry. Well... What's new? How's your leg? Alright. What was it you were going to say earlier in the shower? Nothing. It must have been something. No. - Are you drunk? - No. - I don't know. - You don't know if you're drunk? - Why are you like this? - Like what? You're so bloody strange. You just turn up here and ruin everything. Shit! What's eating you? I haven't done a bloody thing. Yes, you have. What is it I've done? Can't you see? Can't you understand what it feels like? Yes, I can. We were making out just now, weren't we? Well, I'll be seeing you. You'll be mine in the eyes of the night Come to the seashore and make me a king King of the summer and the night The sand is so soft and the girl is so fair Crazy with longing am I Mixed are the fragrances, heavy the air Come to the seashore and stay Until night becomes day Thank you, thank you! Thanks for a fantastic evening. You know what? Kjelle's going to sing a final song. Kjelle will take us back to the mysteries of hot nig hts of love. Oh! Here's a surprise. Here comes Olle! He built this fantastic stage. Kevin! - Well! - Hi! Look! She's come back. Yes. How did it get in? I don't know. I liked your song. Yes? I don't have to tour with Barbro all summer. So you're going to stay here then? That's what I was thinking. That's great!
