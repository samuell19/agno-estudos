[THEME MUSIC] -More events of the past week have again focused attention on our slipshod state highway laws, laws which allow a corrupt highway commission to award contracts to anyone they choose without the obvious benefits of competitive field bidding. The most flagrant examples is our recently completed Governor Clifton Highway. -The irony of faith. Clarence Buckman was killed on his own rotten highway. -How long are the people of this state going to tolerate these corrupt conditions? -Both the evil and its cure are to be found today at Clarence Buckman's funeral. Vincent Cushing, the evil. Head of the state's crooked political machine. John Webb, brilliant young attorney, and his partner, Russ Sampson, the two men who, if they would, could cure the evil. -You know something? -This is the first time Clarence has ever been on the level. -Better get a couple more of Cushing and Webb. -Well, why so many of the same two guys? -Listen, thickhead. The next time those two get together, they may be tough to photograph, because one of them will probably be in the box. -Tell me something, Cushing. What do you pave the highways with? Tapioca? -Yeah, we add raisins to make it hard. -Sounds awfully rich to me. -Phew. This heat is killing me. -We should complain. I got Clarence. -Stand at ease, pal. I'll go in and put the finishing touches on Senator Scott. -Right. -Well, Sam, have you looked into your little crystal ball? -Yes, but it didn't tell me who's behind you. -Sam, coming from me, there's going to be a shock. This thing is honest. My clients want just a fair crack at all the highway projects from now on. Under the present setup, with Cushing in full control of the commission, all the road contracts go to his clique. -Yeah, but fighting Cushing's political machine is a pretty big order, John. Just where do we begin? -With an amendment to the Barry Highway Bill. Simply stipulates that all road contacts from now on be let on the basis of [INAUDIBLE], giving everybody an even break. Of course, you realize that all my clients are definitely interested in your campaign for the United States senate? -You're a mighty convincing talker, John. -Sam, you'll be in there pitching for a great cause. -Yeah, but I'm not the crusader I was at 35. However, I'll try squeezing into the old armor again. Suppose Cushing will sic his new Gazette on me. -About what? The only thing smelly about your past are those cigars. And you can change your brand when you get to Washington. -What goes, [INAUDIBLE]? -Well, Scott's going through for us, but we have to do all the dirty work. -I shall polish up my best brass knuckles. -I think you'd better. It's going to be that kind of a fight. And you know Cushing's gang, no holds are barred. -For the people. -For the $100,000 retainer fee. -That ain't chopped liver. -Look, you'd better go out and dig up all the dirt you can on the Highway Commission. Find out how they get their cuts from Cushing and check on-- -Yeah. ---cross with the other states and see if you can get some fireworks-- -Same old Johnny. -Alma! Honey, you just stepped off a magazine cover. -He knows I'm a sucker for a pretty speech. -Man, can't I get rid of you? -Nope. -Well, I'm sorry. This is Russell, um-- -Sampson, remember? -Yeah, Sampson. Alma Brehmer. This is my partner. In a business way. -How do you do? -How do you do? -Well, you certainly look gorgeous. Whatever did happen to you and me? -I won't listen if you don't want me to. -Oh, it's perfectly all right. There's nothing private about yesterday's blighted romance. -Blighted romance? I never got to first base with you. Now I suppose it's too late, huh? -Yeah, that's right. The only thing any good warmed over is spaghetti. -How about a fast drink? -No, I-- I'm sorry. I can't. I'm meeting a gentlemen friend. -And it's not Cushing? -Oh, yes it is. Coming to his party tonight? Why don't you? I'll tell him that I invited you. -No, thanks. I'll mix my own Mickey Finns. -Yes? -What time's the party? -Any time after 9:00 at the Riviera. -I'll be there. You'll know me. I'll be wearing an armored car. [MUSIC PLAYING] -(SINGING) You've been after me. Feel a bump, bump, bumping in my heart, I know the drip drip drip [INAUDIBLE]. Feeling as though I'm reeling round the boy. Oh, you got me. I can't deny you. I can't be quiet. Come on and take me to [INAUDIBLE]. You've had me. Oh, he knows I'm wiling with a guy that's got a smooth [INAUDIBLE]. Oh, we've got love. Kisses. What an opportunity-- -I hope there aren't any nice girls around tonight. They make me nervous. -You haven't any cause for alarm. -Hey, Captain, look at the starboard bow. Very interesting. Take a look. Shall we pick it up? Aye-aye, sir. -Wait a minute. What about Alma? -Save my place in line, will you, Cappy? Woo! I'm a mustang. -You like [INAUDIBLE] soda? -Yes, thanks. -Don't throw him out. I invited him in a weak moment. -I know you're greeting for Clarence. Move over, I'll greet with you. -In case misjudge all this levity, the after-funeral feast is a legitimate custom dating back to feudal days. -Mmm? You've grubbed off a lot of feudal customs, haven't you? -Come on, Johnny. You're missing out on something special. -Sure, I'm in the mood for something special. -(SINGING) Oh, he's got me. Yes, sir. I just can't fight him. No, sir. Though I despise him, oh, come on and take me, dark and handsome. You've been after me. Oh, I know I haven't got a chance-- -I think I see what you mean. -(SINGING) I hope and pray that love will come today. -Once in a while, she goes a little flat. [APPLAUSE] -Not from where I stand. -She'll be up with the other girls. Let's refuel. Hey, you'd better have something cool. -Listen, you, I got a complaint to make. This is a nice girl. How did she get in here? -Even Cushing can make a mistake. -You got me wrong. I'm the clean-cut type. Crack of dawn, the early worm-- come on, I'll buy you a drink. -Tell me, what have you got against him? -A whole list. -Start at the top. -All right, I will. Number one, Alma Brehmer, number two-- -Darling, you're not reviving that tired old monster, jealousy, are you? -All right, you stick with Cushing. You'll wind up great. GEORGE TAYLOR: I'm look for Alma Brehmer. -Oh, George Taylor. I recognize the smog. -There's Cushing-- then she's here. She's my wife and she's coming with me, or I'll wring her silly neck. -Out of my way, Godena. -You certainly can pick them. -How did I know I was marrying [INAUDIBLE] in the ballroom floor? -There's now an [INAUDIBLE] for another $50,000 in the settlement. Might have come in handy for laying up those winter groceries. -Good old Johnny. Always worrying about everybody but himself. Golden years are whizzing by, and what's happening to our Mr. Webb? -What do you mean, I need the love of some good woman? At that, I often wonder how you and I didn't work out together. We might have been good for each other. -Yeah. Yeah, can you imagine me coming home with the evening paper? Meeting you at the gate of the rose-covered cottage with a gas bill in one hand and an apple pie in the other? -You know something? I used to make a swell apple pie. -I bet you did. I like apple pie. Think you still know how to make it? -Oh, I don't think so. I lost the recipe for a lot of things. -Ah, you're just out of practice. -Why kid ourselves, Johnny? Boat sailed. [CHATTERING] -You wait right here. Whisky? -Yeah, with plenty of gin. -Two highballs. -Look, darling, doesn't that come under the head of unfinished business for you? -You know something? I still bet you can make a great apple pie. -Here we are. -Oh, thank you. Hello. -Hi, Cupcake. You want to dance? -Oh, I'd love to. -Hello, honey. -I've got to dance with one of the guests. Like you said. -Remember? Like you said? -My name's Anne Seymour. -Mine's John Webb. -Are you a politician, too? -No. No, I'm a lawyer. -Certainly enjoyed your performance tonight. -Ooh, it is artistic, isn't it? -Yeah. Yeah. -Penny for your thoughts? -You're getting generous, Pete. -I was a chump to think you'd ever give me a tumble after you got a flash at that Cushing bankroll. -Look. There are very few things in my life that I really regret. One of them is the time I wasted on you. -Cool off, Snow White. Now, let's you and me have a little heart-to-heart talk, hmm? -What would you use? -Must have guessed by this time that dancing is not quite my [INAUDIBLE]. Would you like to sit down? -Oh, yes. Oh, yes, I'd just love to sit. Come on. Come on. Sit here. You know, I'm so glad you liked my number, because, well, people don't know all the rehearsal people have to do. Now, for instance this morning. I tried for over an hour just to hit the right note, and I couldn't make it. Now, you wouldn't believe that, would you? -Hmm? Oh, yes. Yes, I would. -Want to know something else? The girl I live with, [INAUDIBLE] her name is, of course isn't her real name, and I call her Smelly Annie, but it isn't such a good joke because her name isn't Anne either. But she does use a lot of perfume and she's psychic. And she said, if I played my cards right, I could get to be a radio singer and then just make barrels of do-re-mi. That's slang for money. And then I could save, and by the time I'm 21, well, I could have everything. -Hold it. How old did you say you were? -18. -You sure? -Mm-hmm, and, ah, 2 months. Oh, I can remember my fifteenth birthday in a Long Island mansion. My father threw me a coming out party. We were very rich millionaires then, and that was just, ah, three years ago, so that makes me-- -Yeah. Yeah, 18 and 2 months. -Well, what's the matter? I like you. -Now, look, Puss. Why don't you go out and get yourself a nice, young college fellow? You're just too young to decide who you like and who you don't like. -Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. Must be like those fishing laws where if you catch anything too young, you have to throw them back in. -Yeah. Yeah, you gotta throw them back in. -Now you can't date me, huh? -That's right. Now I can't date you. -But I can date you, I mean, because you're over 21 and that makes-- -No. That doesn't work out that way. You go out and get yourself a nice, young college boy. -Oh, but look, I don't want a college fellow, because-- -I don't particularly thrive on competition. -Silly, he's only my lawyer. -You'll get a new one in the morning. -Vincent, I hope that isn't an order, because I don't take them. -Let go of me, oh, let me go. Let me go! -Oh, that swine. Vincent, stop him. -Why, you big bully. You-- Oh! -What's the matter with you, here? Are you paralyzed? Call me tomorrow, Peter. I know a good dentist. Come on, Cinderella. Let's take off. -What happened? -Small Parts just cut in. -Webb, I didn't expect you to act like one of the Robo Boys. -Oh, that's what fascinates people. The many sides to my character. Maybe I'll them all to you sometime. -Now, wait a minute. Don't try anything funny. Remember, I'm sober. -Gee, you were grand. The rest of them were really scared. [HUMMING] -Good evening, Mr. Webb. You're in early this morning. -I'm all right. -Mr. Webb, have you been having words with somebody again? -Hmm? Oh, no, that's nothing. Just a little bite. -Mr. Webb, you sure give your womenfolks a lot of wear and tear. -Goodnight, Art. -Goodnight, Mr. Webb. -Gee! Looks just like a place that you wouldn't live in. -No kidding? What is? -Oh, I like it. Ooh. Forgot about my foot. [INAUDIBLE] big bully. -All right. Uncle John needs to take a look. -My father had a room like this in our old plantation mansion in Virginia. But, of course, that was before we lost our millions. -You said your mansion was in Long Island. -Well, that was the summer mansion. -Oh. You said they had a lot of millions? -Oh, yes, yes. Millions of them. You'll feel better after you have some coffee. -Thanks for fixing my foot. -This'll warm you up. -Oh, I'm not cold. -Hey. Wow. -What's the matter? -Put on your dress, will you? -Oh! You got a great, big spot on your beautiful rug. Have you got any benzine? -Look, Puss. Will you put on your dress? You embarrass me. -Oh. I had to take it off to find out where it was torn. -You see? I could sew it up here, but then the seam would show. -Oh. -I could take it in here, but, well, then that would make it droop here. -Well, that might be very becoming. -Well, yes, but it would ruin the style of the dress. -Well, you could sew it up here, maybe. -Then I couldn't sit down. Prettiest dress I ever had, too. -You're sure you're 18? -Mm-hmm, and 2 months. Because my birthday was on the same day that Uncle Elmer busted a blood vessel. -Right now, I know just how Uncle Elmer felt. Look, Puss. But the body in the dress, and I'll put you in a cab. Come on. You know, you might buy another dress, and you wouldn't have to worry about those seams. They might not become an international issue. -Jeepers. A hundred dollars? Boy! I like you! -Will you put on the dress? -All right. Pull it down, please. -Now, look. It's past your bedtime. -OK. Zip me. -You're zipped. Come on. -Goodnight. -Goodnight, Puss. -Oh, wait a minute, Art. You know, it must be getting monotonous. But I like you. Goodnight. -Uncle Elmer. -Good morning, Miss Ater. -Hello, Johnny. -Any mail? -You don't mind if I look at it, do you? -Oh, now look what you did. Do you want to knock it all crooked? -Why not? -Now, look. Just because you took me to dinner a few times-- -Two times. -And brought me a few drinks-- -A few gallons. -It doesn't give you the to treat me like one. -What, now what do I treat you like? -Well, I don't like your nasty innuendos. And I don't have to hold still for such cracks, neither. -Get me Mike Daley on the phone, will you? -Please. -Please. -Well, yes, Mr. Webb. He's here. -Hey, hey! -Hey. Telephone for you, Mr. Daley. -Oh. That's very gracious of you. Hello? -I had a beef with that rat Godena last night. I got a little tomato by the name of Anne Seymour involved. Afraid he might take it out on her. -I'll tell her everything. -See that no one gets rough with her. So long, sweetheart. -What's that? -My new nail file. -Well, is there something I can do for you? Sharpen a few pencils or something? -Now you made me forget what I came in for. -Surprise! -That was it. -You'll just go crazy when you see the picnic. But it's-- -Look, Puss. I've got a lot of work to do. -Oh, I'll bet you have. Smelly Annie says any man who can give a girl $100 just like that must keep his nose right to the grindstone. You know, she can snap her fingers there. You got a paper opener? Let me see, here. What? Oh, boy. Look. It has the biggest pleats. Do you want to see it on? Here, it'll only take a minute. -Puss, take it easy. -Say, Johnny, I've got a date. -Uh, she's just showing me some things here. -I can tell. I forgot to tell you Mr. Smith phoned this morning. -Oh. I'm glad you don't write those messages down, Miss Ater. It might fall into the wrong hands. What with the country teeming with international spies. -Here. Hold this for me. Let me show you, because it'll only take a minute. -Puss, will you cut it out? You embarrass me. Besides I got an important phone call to make. -Oh. Well, if you don't see them on, how will I know you if you like them, or whether I have to take them back, or whether I'll need a check, or what I have to-- -Hold it. Wha-- What do you mean a check? -Well, you see, we spend the $100. And you know Smelly Annie's psychic. And she says a man of your income wouldn't be seen dead meeting me in front of the place we were living in. So we moved to a new apartment. And you'll just love it, because even the stopper in the bathtub fits. -I was worried about that. -Here, let me show you. -Puss. Look, Puss. You just sit still for five minutes. -Oh, but let me-- -I'm going to go out and see if I can't arranged a charge account for you. [SINGING AND PLAYING GUITAR] -I hate to be irrelevant-- -I'm just trying to keep in practice. -What was it today, [INAUDIBLE]? Well, hello, Smith. This is Webb. Webb! Louder, I can almost here! [SINGING LOUDER] -Oh, Smith. Scott's proposing that amendment this morning. Yes, we're taking care of Cushing. Cost you a hundred grand. $100,000 to go right back to where you started from. -Johnny, can you sign this? -Wait a minute, something important has come up. -I gotta get my hair fixed. That cheap electric fan ruins it. Sign it. -$10 for what? -An advance on my salary. I gotta get a new girdle. -Make that out of the electric fan. What? Sure I know it's a lot of money, but I'm taking the gamble. $100,000 if we win, slam the door in my face if we lose. You'll be selling [INAUDIBLE] to the saints before you can say [INAUDIBLE]. Bye. $30,000 is your cut. -Oh, thanks, chum. So it's all over but the shooting, huh? -5 minutes are up. -You can have an extension. -Hey, Alma Brehmer's on the phone. Looks like I'll never get out of here. -Someday, I'm going to slip a time bomb in her lunch box. Hiya, babes. -One-Punch Web? Your exhibition payed dividends. Vincent and I quarreled over you, and this morning it cost him a gorgeous diamond bracelet to erase that famous Brehmer scowl. -Tonight? What for? -I thought maybe you could drop by and add this to my insurance policy. Swell. Around 8:00. I have a heavy date at 9:00. Bye, darling. -So long, dear. -Get a load of the lambchop. -One minute you're going around with me, the next minute you're not going around with me. You're going around with somebody else. -Oh, you got me all wrong, Puss. -Oh, ho. A trifler, eh? Now if you prefer the outdoor, the clean-cut type, I'll buy a drink. -Wait a minute, I'll go with you. I want to read the afternoon papers. -Come on, shortcake, we're attracting a crowd. -10 gets you 50. When Cushing hear about that amendment, they had to scrape him off the ceiling. -I see where the News Gazette threatened Scott with both barrels, one above the belt and the other below. -Well, we expected that. Fortunately, the Citizen has the civic spirit. Gave the amendment four stars. -Woohoo! -Can I have the funnies? -Here's a picture of Senator Biery to start with. -Mr., there's not enough gin in this Tom Collins. -That's a lemonade, lady. -Well, put some more sugar in it, then. -What time is it, Russ? I've gotta grab a shave, go back to the office, and see about those policies of Alma's. -You know, this is a marvelous watch. Wakes me up in the morning, cooks my breakfast, darns my socks, boils my eggs-- -Make up those corny jokes too, does it? What time is it? -It's, ah-- what do you expect from a watch, everything? -Mmm. Keep your dress on, toots. -Oh, I know where you're going. And don't come crawling back to me on your hands and feet. -Carry on, Jim. -Bye, Mr. Webb. You know, I used to like him. [WHISTLING] -Alma? Alma? [SCREAM] [SCREAM] [SCREAM] -It won't do you much good now, pal. But I'll square this for you. I'll square it if I have to smash every-- believe me, kid, I'll square it. -Yeah, that's right. A-- m-m-m-murder in the penthouse at the Fenner Arms, the Fenner Arms. R-r-r- right! Trace that, Captain. -Hey, come back here, you. You can't do that to the arm of the law. -You've been drinking. -Resisting an officer, eh? Say, do you live here? -Listen, flatfoot. You can let go of that arm, arrest me, or get knocked into that jar of shrubbery. -You're under arrest. Tell Captain Graves to come down a minute. I've caught a suspicious character. -Oh, yes. -What's the matter, Humboldt, would they let you play? -I stopped this man according to orders, Captain. He resisted and threatened to throw me right over that jar of shrubbery. -That's not true, Humboldt. I said that one. -Let him go. -Well, now, Captain, you're not going to let Humboldt break up a beautiful friendship, are you? -Mr. Webb, it occurs to me that you may have purposely picked a fight with Humboldt to establish the time of your arrival. -Yeah. Guess, then, I did. -Floor? -Penthouse, for me. -Couldn't have been dead over a half an hour. -Well, I would like to know if this is a job of a professional crook, or-- -The jewelry's gone. A fancy knife like that is not standard equipment for a second-story man. -This Brehmer woman knew a lot of prominent people, ah, socially, and I will immediately clear up this case before The Citizen starts blackening everybody. -I thought you were still black from the last case. -District Attorney Joyce, this is Mr. Webb, he was her attorney. -How do you know? -Pretty big case, huh, to bring out the DA personally? -Did you have an appointment with Miss Brehmer tonight? -Nothing definite about it. Said to come around 8:00. -Little late, aren't you? -Yeah. Yeah, I sure am. Plenty late. -What were your relations with Miss Brehmer? -Very close friends, but don't overwork your imagination. -What were you seeing her about? -To handle her insurance. Vincent Cushing had just given her an armful of jewelry, and she wanted it covered. -Could be. -Just a minute, Webb. How do we know that you're telling the truth? You're no friend of Cushing's. -Oh, but you are. And something that you kiddies out to know. Alma told me she had a date about 9:00. -If we only knew who she had that date with. -I just told you. Cushing gave her a ton of diamonds. Have you got a cigarette? -You seem to be very much interested in this case, Mr. Webb. -Yeah. Yeah, I certainly am. For most of you, that's just a body in there. Well, for me, it's Alma Brehmer. And the scum that did it is going to burn. -You needn't get so melodramatic about it. We all feel as badly as you. -Hello there, Joyce. -How do you do, Mr. Cushing? -I heard about it outside. I think it's rotten. Only a cheap cutthroat would do a thing like this. -Oh, Vincent, that's embarrassing. I was just telling them you were their best suspect. -Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. -I'll upset him. As far as I'm concerned, he's our number-one suspect. He's the only one that knew about that jewelry that you gave Miss Brehmer. -I didn't give Miss Brehmer any jewelry. -You had a date with her tonight, didn't you? -Well, not exactly. She wanted my advice about some securities. -Take your dirty hands off me. -We found him lurking around outside the building. He said something about, um, wringing her skinny neck. -Good work, O'Leary. -Yeah, I'll wring her skinny neck. No. It isn't-- Alma. Alma! Oh, this is Alma. Alma, darling. -Well, Mr. Godena parked around the corner. Said he was waiting for Mr. Cushing, but you told me-- -Well, the suspects are piling up. -Yeah. They're coming of the woodwork now. -Who killed her? You were afraid she'd come back to me, Cushing? -Take it easy. -You killed her. [GUNSHOT] -Why didn't you search him, O'Leary? -Well, I thought Humboldt did it. -Well, I thought O'Leary did it. -Yeah. -Bert, bring the iodine. -Give me that. Allow me. Hurts, doesn't it? -Yeah. I'm sorry, Webb. It's only a scratch. -Let go of me. Why you-- you big bully, you-- why, if you tear my dress, I'm going to tell Mr. Webb on you, and he knows a lot of gangsters, and they're going to rub you out, and that's slang for, and-- Johnny, Johnny, make them stop. -What are you doing here? -She tried to get upstairs. She was saying she wanted to stop Mr. Webb before it was too late. -Too late? -Yeah. -For what? -Oh, now, wait a minute. -You mean, you suspected him of wanting to kill Miss Brehmer? -No. No, he wanted to make love to her. I was the one that wanted to kill her, just because she's got a pair of-- Oh, Johnny! -If you don't mind, I'd like to go home and have a doctor look at this. -We're holding everyone for questioning. -Might I suggest that you concentrate on Mr. Webb? -Why don't you lie low and you'll blow over? -You know, I've been thinking. Whoever phoned us was up her first, and might have stepped in that blood while it was still wet. Now, if there's a particle of it left on their shoes, our chemist can find it. -But the real murderer may not be in this group. -That's right. He may not. Captain, ask them to take off their shoes. -Their shoes? -Yeah, you know. Shoes. -All right. That goes for everybody. -If they walk around very much, the blood might wear away. And put a tag with a name on every pair. -Take off your shoes. -Look, Puss. He's wearing socks. -Looks like the little pig's been playing the market. -All right, come on. Captain Graves will take you to headquarters for preliminary questioning. -Well, in that case, ah-- you can always send for a lawyer. -Now see here, Webb. You're not going to turn this into a three-ring circus. -Oh, my dear Joyce. You can't fly in the face of a constitutional right. Humboldt. -Sir? -Do me a favor, will you? Call up Sampson at Chestnut 7878 and tell him to come down here and defend me against the district attorney. -Oh, that's kindergarten stuff, Webb. -Now, now, Cushing. Surely I'm entitled to a pal, too, with you playing Ring Around the Rosie with Junior here. -I'll go on ahead and drop these with the laboratory. -Oh, Inspector? Half soles and new laces on mine. -Just got the news from Fromm. I'm awful sorry, buddy. -Thanks, sweetheart. -Look, I brought all the habeas corpuses I could find, and a Ouija board. -Good. If I know my Cushing and Joyce, I'm right in the middle of a squeeze play. -Yoo-hoo. Come on and sit over here. You can see swell. -How'd the cupcake get mixed up in this? Oh, never mind. I'll find out firsthand. -Mr. Fromm is going to ask some questions. I would like to have them answered without the dubious benefit Mr. Webb's uncalled-for, unethical, and unfunny remarks. -Has anyone here ever seen this knife before? -Ooh. -Yes? Yes, Ms. Seymour? -Oh, no. No, I'm sorry. Mr. Webb once had a paper-cutter like that, but it's not the same, because his was a paper-cutter. -You're sure it's not the same? -Mmm, Yes, I'm sure I'm sure. -She's sure. -There's one question I'd like to ask you, Mr. Cushing. Did you give Miss Brehmer a costly diamond bracelet this morning? -Ah-ah. No signals. -No, of course not. That's absurd. -Don't give us that. You quarreled with Alma Brehmer last night, you gave her the jewelry this morning, tonight you could have killed her in a fit of jealous rage. Anyone that knows you can testify to your violent temper. -Well, yes, that's right, because one time Mr. Cushing got so mad at Mr. [INAUDIBLE]-- -Quiet. ---that the veins stood out in his neck. -Gentlemen, I'd like to make a suggestion. -Mr. Webb, you may as well keep your mouth shut, because we're not going to believe one word you say against Mr. Cushing. -Mr. District Attorney, if you refuse to hear the testimony of any homicide suspect, you're violating the federal constitution, the state laws, and local ordinance number 482. -Paragraph four. -Thank you. Any questions? -If I wasn't drunk, they never would have caught me. -Give that man some black coffee, and keep working on him. We may get a confession. -Now, Mr. Taylor. You're the ex-husband of the deceased. Do you know anyone near to her who might have had a motive for this killing? -No, I don't. -May I embellish that? Mr. Taylor resented paying his ex-wife the $100,000 settlement that I obtained for her. -That's not true. -Mr. Taylor needs cash. He could have threatened her with a loan. She refused. He killed her. -You cheap trickler. -He has fresh scratches on his cheeks. They could have come from a nail file. And I wonder if any of you smart kiddies noticed that Alma's nail file is missing. -I've been drinking. I fell down and cut myself. -Did you fall on a manicure, sir? -Who's conducting this inquiry? The police department or this ambulance chaser? -Sit down. -Oh. How about a doughnut? -Taylor was always jealous of Cushing. He threatened them both last night at the Riviera. We were all witness to that. -Is that true? -No. -No. -I think you'd better get Mr. Webb a cup of black coffee. -Well, you're just a bunch of big fibbers, because I heard him myself. -Wait a minute, young lady. Three people in this room have testified-- -Ow! Hey, will you look what you're doing? -So sorry, old man. -How well did you know the deceased? -Pretty well. I know she spent a lot of time with Webb. -I'm sure you'll have something to say. -I certainly have. I know Godena knew Alma well enough to hate her inside because she turned him down for Cushing. -I've never been so flattered in all my life. -You don't have to laugh so loud, Pete. I don't think you killed her. Gentlemen, I happen to know Mr. Godena pretty well. And I don't think he'd try to tackle a full-grown woman armed only with a knife. -There. -Look out. -My dear-- -Ow! Will you keep off my feet? -I'm so sorry. -Go on, beat it. -There. -Yeah? -How about another doughnut? -That man's faking. Wake him up. -No tonic. And one silver [INAUDIBLE]. -This thing has turned into a three-ring circus. -Here's the report, sir. -Thanks. Well. They found blood on one of Webb's shoes. But it's not Miss Brehmer's blood. The report is definite about that. -Blood is blood. And east is easy. And west is west and never the twain shall meet. -Quiet! -This particular blood is from Mr. Cushing's arm wound. They checked with the Bandaid. -I'll burn the shoes in the morning. -This investigation has turned into a three-ring circus. -Two tickets, please. -Get that man out of here. -All right, come on. Come on. -Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't push. Don't-- don't push. I stand on my constitutional rights. -Now I'm going to let you all go for the time being. All right, so you can all take your shoes. -Ow! -My dear fellow, I hope you're not hurt. -Why, you-- -None of you will attempt to leave town. If you do, I'll have you picked up and booked. -Johnny! Johnny. Johnny. Do you know what I think? -What? -I think whoever it is just won't admit it. -Slow down, Puss. -Right back where we started. All we have left to work on is the knife. -Where is it? -Gone. [SINGING] -Hey. -What? -You double check on those figures? -Did I ever let you down? -I'd rather not answer that. -Folks got to appreciate this. I'll never get the paint out from under my nails. -We all have to make sacrifices for the good of the community. We need to help the Senator present the simple and honest facts. -Say when. -Ho, ho, wait a minute. Couldn't kill that many people in the year with the bubonic plague. -Don't get technical. -What was that for? -I had a little paint left over in the brush. [BUZZER RINGING] -Yeah. -There's a guy here to see you. -Oh, a guy, huh? -Well, let's see. I've paid my rent. Paid my tailor. You're supposed to tell me if I'm getting warm. -Very funny. He says he's from The Citizen. -The good side of the press. Better talk to him. -Yeah. Thought you wanted to see me. -She's cuter. -I never get a tumble around here anymore. -Have time for a few questions, Webb? -I can answer the first one. I didn't kill Alma Brehmer. -The News Gazette thinks you did. -Cushing set that type. -You mean Cushing's trying to protect someone close? -Oh, yeah, very close. Himself. -Hmm. Did you tell the police that? -Sure, I told them. -They had a faraway look in their eye. They wouldn't hold him if he walked in and confessed. -Senator Scott sent us. -He's in there. -The editor keeps banging his head against the stone wall of corruption, but he's running out of heads. -Start hinting that it's Cushing. That's your bombshell. -Yeah, that's swell. You light the fuse, but if goes off in our face. I'll see how the editor feels about it. Webb, you're a one-man war, bit if you get to be an old political boss, keep me in mind, will you? I've always had a yen to be police commissioner so I can leave my car in the no-parking spaces. -Miss Ater? Put him down for commissioner. -How do you spell commissioner? Well, don't blame me if I get stuck. -A little missionary work with The Citizen. -I got two derbys and a gray fedora. -Fedora only counts as-- -This may be a little bit off the subject, John, but did you kill Alma? -I told you I got a note warning me. -I remember about the note and I remember it didn't sound very convincing. -Well, maybe you had your own reasons. [BUZZER RINGING] -Yeah? -There are some cops here, and it doesn't surprise me. Captain Braves and Inspector Fromm. -Morning, gents. -Well, gentlemen, this is an unexpected pleasure. -Hope you don't mind if we take a look around? -We haven't a search warrant, but we thought that-- -Oh, you're always welcome. Of course, you had to take part luck. -All right, boys. Have at it. -What do you suppose they're looking for? -I think it's a treasure hunt where they're supposed to bring back a couple of lawyers. -No. I know what it is. -What? -They're looking for a k-n-i-f-e. Shh. -Like to try it? -Mm-hmm. -Humboldt. -No, thanks. -No. You're cold. -How am I doing? -Well, you're getting warm. -Have-- have you ever seen one of these? -Oh. Nice. -Would-- would you like to try one? It's been a long, hard search. -A-a-a-a. -Oh. No, thanks. -OK. -Oh, we have some sliding panels? Secret trapdoors? False bottoms? And transparent windows in my partner's office. Would you like to see them? -See if he can find anything in the other office. -See if they can find the other office? -Hold this. -You better hold it. That's it, [INAUDIBLE]. Got a cigarette? -We're sorry to bother you, Mr. Webb. -That's the trouble with these fortune-tellers. You're can't depend on them. -Surprise! -Mr. Webb, they had the cutest cap, the thing I [INAUDIBLE], and I just couldn't-- [SCREAM] What's going on in here? -Uh, just one of I fainting spells during the excitement. -Seeing real policemen, everything. -They make up more new games. -I just lost the best years of my life. -Aw, jeepers. It was a dirty trick, but I had to do it. Puss, I'll get you a barrel of charge accounts. I'll make it up to you in 100 ways. Honest, I will, Puss. -I've seen everything now. -I don't know what you're talking about. Aw, Puss. -Think of it, gentlemen. The lives of more than 3,000 men, women, and children snuffed out in the past 12 months. -Gentlemen. False figures. Figments of a fertile and unscrupulous imagination. -Senator Scott has the floor. -Figures are sometimes unreliable. Consequently, we will give you more than mere statistics. The truth in asphalt form. -Everything but performing fleas. I Really, gentlemen. -Order, please. Senator Scott has the floor. -We have here 12 samples of pavement from various other states and a sample of our own. This is an official testing machine. Pressure can be exerted by this machine equal to the wear of millions of cars a year passing over the pavement. To demonstrate, Oklahoma. 6.6 pressure. Translated, this paving is good for 27 years. -It's a very good show. -I underestimated Mr. Webb. -And now a sample of our own state. -Good for seven years, unable to stand up under the wear of ten million cars, not including bicycles, scooters, and roller skates. -I think it's about time Mr. Webb was picked up for murder. -There are quicker ways. -Uh-oh. -I know. Spring cleaning. -No, this is getting a little monotonous. -Maybe we ought to leave it like this, and next time they'll straighten it up, huh? -I don't have to look. Gone. -Do you think maybe we offended somebody in the Magician's Union? -What is it, termites? -Cushing, I think. Practically the same thing. -Well, if this is your idea of a funny joke, you can just clean it up yourself. -My secretary. -Hey, you know? You guys have overlooked something. -What? -The one person who had the best motive for killing Alma Brehmer. The best and oldest motive. Jealousy. -You know, I'm getting just a little bit weary of this stupid jealousy of yours. -You didn't treat her like that, no you didn't. Or did you? Maybe you did kill her. You crush everything you're tired of. Why don't you kill me, too? -Oh, shut up. -You've left me nothing to live for. Go on, kill me. Or I'll do it myself. -What, again? I told you there was always a loaded revolver in the desk drawer. -I'm leaving now, Mother, and I'll need five whole dollars. Mother, are you ill again? -No, no, no. I'm all right. -Well, you certainly don't look all right. -Please, child. Leave me now. I'm just a little tired. Get the money from your father. -OK. -Mother. -You-- -But Mother-- -Leave us alone for a moment. Leave us alone. -You'd better go, dear. Have you completely lost your reason? -Murderer. Murderer. You hear me? You're a murderer. -Why must you always believe the vicious lies Webb has put in the papers about me? You, my wife. -Your wife. You've killed me. You've killed her. You've even killed her father. Yes, I know all about it. You killed her father when she found out you killed her. -What did you do with that clipping? What did you do with that clipping? -I'm saving it for the police. [CRASHING NOISE] -Rather soft there, pal. Out of condition? Well. I'm sorry. Miss Cushing, I presume? -Move over just a little. I can't breathe. -Mm-hmm. Well, I suppose now that you're out of finishing school, you're doing all of your father's second-story work, hmm? -This is my own idea. You see, the things The Citizen has been saying about him made Mother. Very unhappy. -So you decided to stop all the news right at its source, hm? -Mm-hmm. -Your dad did leave something worthwhile in my study, didn't he? Oh, ah-- by the way. How old are you? -22. Why? -Mmm, nothing. -Oh, would you have a cigarette? -Don't mind if I do. -Mr. Webb, you sure got a unusual technique. -Don't bother. I'll get a cab. Goodnight, Johnny. -Goodnight, sweetie. -Wait a minute. I just came to see you to tell you that I'm not going to see you anymore. And you can just stop chasing me, because I wouldn't look at you if you came to me on your hands and feet. I'm -Good morning, miss. Mr. Webb ain't here this morning. He went to the office. -Yes, I know. I just wanted to return this. -Are you feeling better this morning, miss? -I've never felt better in my life. -Some folks think he's too violent, but it sure is successful technique. -Good morning, Miss Ater. Why don't you use your own phone? -Just routine. -I'm sure you can explain all this very readily. -You get the idea, Mr. Webb? -Sure. The whole picture comes to me at once. Including the frame. -Let me see, was it Aesop or Mr. Godena that said, ah, keep your nose clean? -Well, we got you, Webb. Your secretary found out that you killed Alma Brehmer, so you-- you silenced her permanently. No use looking there. You won't find his fingerprints. He's too smart for that. -Trouble with you, is, George, you think you're Dick Tracy. -And right before my very eyes, why, he dragged that poor girl through the lobby by the hair of her head and he'd even beat her into a great big pulp. -Yeah, that's Johnny. He'd rather beat a woman into a big pulp than smoke a good cigar any day. Well, how are you, Johnny? -Hi, Russ. -You know my psychopathic friends here, don't you? -Yeah. -Hello, Puss. -You keep your hellos to yourself, thank you. -Well, Miss Seymour, what were those interesting things you were saying about Mr. Webb the few moments ago? -It was nothing at all. I was just saying that he had a battle with his secretary last night. -And? -Be careful of what you're saying. -Well, now, don't try to deny it, because it was your secretary. -Undoubtedly, Mr. Webb has another alibi. -Now you're going to be surprised, Papa. -Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me. I have some business to attend to at the News Gazette. -He's writing the cooking column. -Pardon me. -Come on, give him a break. Hold the cars for him. -Thanks. -Oh, hi, Mr. Webb. Hi, [INAUDIBLE]. How's everything? -OK. Wife had a little touch of the flu, but she's over it now. -Oh! -Ed. Miss Seymour has some very important information. -Oh! -OK. I'll take care of her. -Yeah. All right. Get him out of here. -Take a good look, Webb. Maybe you'll learn. -Listen, Joyce. I like a good ulterior motive as well as the next man. But you're going a little too far. -Unfortunately, Mr. Webb, I must do my duty. Let's go. -Mr. Webb. I am P. Hemingway Collins, secretary of the Citizens' Better Government League. -Delighted, Mr. Collins. -Our league is convinced that you are the man to fight corruption in our fair city, the graft and crime that is allowed to flourish by Vincent Cushing, Senator Biery, and District Attorney Joyce. -Well, I'm sorry you haven't met the district attorney. Mr. Collins, Mr. Joyce. -How do you do? -How do you do? -I got it. Lucky Judge White owed me $25 from that last poker game. -Oh, habeas corpus, eh? All right, Webb. One of these days, you're going to run out of judges. -Sure, I know. It's Halloween, you're a spook, and you've got to scare me. -Let's go. -Mr. Webb, you are quite sure that is the district attorney? -Well, that's what they laughingly call him around the News Gazette. -You better mobilize expenses, Daddy. It's another $5 touch. -Certainly, my dear. [INAUDIBLE] -You probably don't remember me. I was Madder of The Citizen before your bombshell went off in my face. Miss Vlissingen, Mr. Webb, Mr. Sampson. -And, ah, [INAUDIBLE]. -How do you do? -She's your new secretary. -Yes. The agency sent me. -And, ah, can you type? I've always wanted a secretary that could type. -You know how to make a [INAUDIBLE] cake? That'll come in handy. Can you spell commissioner? -Um, c-o-m-- -Splendid splendid. Don't overdo it. -Darling, you start today. Give me your coat. Oh, you haven't got a coat. Well, I'll buy you one. Come on, I'll show you around the factory here. -I know how to spell commissioner. -Why that light, fluffy mood? What's happened to the old Madder that [INAUDIBLE] before us? -He was fined for hanging out with a couple of murderers and getting the paper out on a limb. Get a load of that. -Mm-hmm. Well, that reads the same as the News Gazette. Uh-oh. [WHISTLING] -Get that, Russ. The knife has vanished from the police laboratory. -I'm going to start sleeping with my windows closed. I wonder if they make steel pajamas. -Madder? Will positive proof that Cushing is the rotten apple in the political barrel get you your miserable position back for you? -The answer is obviously. Yes. -Punch into the office in the morning. Your time card'll be in the rack. -Maybe I've been skeptic from birth. -Nothing new against the forces of evil, huh, pappy? -Nope. We'll get something. -Ha, ha, ha. -All right, but they laughed at Marconi too. -I don't know, I didn't think is stuff was funny. -Russ? The murder candidates have narrowed down to Cushing and Godena for my girl. How would the police know that Ater was murdered if they hadn't been tipped off? Now, that looks to me like the good old frameroo. Mike. Think you still know how to open a safe? -I don't have to know how. I get blow on them. -I'm convinced. -You, ah, you wouldn't be thinking of Cushing's safe? -Oh, look. What do you want me to do with this thing? -Give it to me. Snicker that. I'm going to liquidate this in the south river. -Ah, our Mr. Webb. I know you'd like to meet our committee. Miss Dottering, Mrs. Rosen Buchanan, and Mrs. [INAUDIBLE]. Staunch crusaders for clean government. -Yes, ah, you ladies will have to excuse us now. We're going to make arrangements to rob a safe. -Spy! -Oh, Puss. -Do you like it? Saw it in a window. Hello, Russ. And I got to thinking that maybe I ought to forgive you and let the [INAUDIBLE] bury the hatchet. -Mike! Mike, you got us. -Somebody must have cheated Cushing. I could have kicked that safe open with my stocking feet. -Here, I'll help. And besides, I was afraid the murderer might come after you next. And I don't want to be almost a widow, because my mother was almost a widow once when my father almost died. It was Friday, and he got a fishbone caught right in his throat. -Nothing here yet, Johnny. -Mr. Joyce sure crosses his ts funny. You know, I heard if you cross your ts a certain way, you're going to go insane before you're 21. -Eureka. -Puss, you're a hero. -Jeepers! Gee, I like that, but my goodness, what was it for? -For finding this. -Well, my gosh, I'll find you lots more. -What a headline this is going to make for the Citizen. Joyce Sells Police Department to Vincent Cushing. -That'll hang Cushing to the well-known hickory limb. -This is cute. Must be a grocery list. I'll bet you Mr. Cushing does all of his wife's shopping. -My gosh. Something special again? -Oh, it certainly is. -Just what is your ambition? To clean up the state, get rid of Cushing, find the murderer, avoid getting yourself hung, or standing there playing post office? -This, my friend, is a slot-machine pamphlet for last month, and a one-way ticket to the big house for Mr. Cushing, Mr. Godena, and the district attorney. -And Senator Biery. You know, it's going to be so easy to put that amendment through now, it's almost a sin to take that $100,000 fee. -Tell you something else, chum. I made a promise. Now that Cushing's power is gone, the [INAUDIBLE] won't be afraid to go after the murderer. -That proves that the knifing was done by one of Cushing's mob. -And very significant that Godena's cut was less than half after Alma's death. -That proves Cushing had something on him. It's liable to be murder. Look, John, if I'm not too indelicate, where is this going to get you if it don't work? -Madder's kids have to eat, don't they? [SINGING] -I smell victory. -Congratulations on the accuracy of your smeller. -Wait. Don't say anything until you know who I am. -Who I am? -I'm Madder, the old hard-boiled reporter whose babies have taken up eating again. -You remember him? -Aladdin, the guy with the magic lantern. -Morning, boys. -Hi, inspector. -Inspector, huh? You don't keep up with things, Webb. Congratulations are in order. -All right, congratulations. You got him. You're perhaps the DA, the commissioner, or the mayor, or all three of them. -As commissioner, my first official duty is an unpleasant one inasmuch as your anti-Joyce campaign was responsible for my promotion. -Fromm, are you trying to tell me in a very subtle way that I'm under arrest? -Webb, I'm really very grateful. -Oh, now, wait a minute, girls. I'll go get my violin. -But the News Gazette has been screaming that you're the murderer. And you are the only logical one who could have killed your secretary. So I've got to take you in. -Well, now, wait a minute, Fromm. I can't go to jail now. I gottta have a few hours to figure this all out. -Surprise! Ooh! I'm so glad you're here, Inspector, because Smelly Annie-- I mean, a certain friend of mine, had a dream where the commissioner is the murderer and you were the corn fritter-- -Hush! Those dreams have got you slap-happy. -All right, then. Look, I want to show you the dress I got. It's wonderful, and I'm going to exchange it in the morning. -Come on, corn fritter. Let's erase ourselves from the domestic scene. -OK. I'll expect you at headquarters in the morning. You can sleep in your own bed tonight. It's softer. And besides, you'll probably want to spend the evening with that girl of yours. But don't leave town. You're on your own. -Thanks, Fromm. -Did you tell him I was your girl? -Yes, people say a lot of foolish things in an emergency. You know what? I'm in a spot. -You ain't no place else, pappy. Mr. Webb's residents. Yeah, wait a minute. -Yes? -John, I'm worried about you. I just met Graham, the new DA. Now, he's honest, but he's convinced that you did the murders. -Well, something might turn up. Yeah. Yes, I'm going down in the morning. Oh, what about the amendment? -You know, we vote on it tomorrow. You know, a lot of the boys around here still read the News Gazette. -OK. I haven't got enough trouble. -Call me in for the peace conference. -Now, Puss, please. -Don't you "Puss please" me. I wouldn't take you back if you came to me on your hands and feet. And this time, I mean it. -You know, Johnny, there are a couple of other things could have happened to you today. You could have stubbed your toe or you could have got a splinter under your fingernail. -Ah, the way I feel, [INAUDIBLE] wouldn't make him [INAUDIBLE]. Cushing's handwriting! How do you like that? Look. Read it. Must have pulled it out of Sarilla's pocket. -Alma's father was murdered, too. -Look, Alma had this clipping, Cushing discovered it. Now, before Alma died, Godena's cut on the slot machines was just as much as Cushing's. But after the murder, Cushing paid him less than half as much and this is the reason why. And I'll tell you something else. That throwing knife definitely came from Texas. How long would it take you to pack your pink toothbrush and charter a plane? -For Morganville, Texas? -For Morganville, Texas. -All right, wait a minute, wait a minute. What's the first prize if we get to Morganville and it's a [INAUDIBLE] brainstorm? We stand a chance to lose a good night's sleep. -So if it's a brainstorm, I make the Bastille in the morning. -OK, chum. I'll get the plane. -Where's the cemetery? -About two miles down the road. -We'll have this back by 1 o'clock. Thanks. -Say, Johnny, just what is this cemetery routine? And look, isn't this about the time that Mr. Holmes usually tells Watson what's going on? -OK. Whoever killed Alma's father came from this town, subsequently left here, and committed the other two murders. -Quite so, quite so. Hey, I do a pretty good Watson, don't I? -If the murderer did come from this town, it's pretty much of a sense he's got relatives buried here. So, we look for the family name on the tombstone. Cushing, Godena, or Taylor. -Yeah, but wouldn't the murderer have changed his name after knocking off Alma's old man? -You know, Russ, that's the strange thing. Criminals seldom change their names completely. They retain their mother's maiden name or their father's given name. I don't know whether it's a matter of sentiment or pride, but they always retain some part of the old name. -Yeah. -Uh-oh. This it is, I guess. -Scared? -Yeah, a little around the edges. -Here the lord comes. Repent, repent, you sinners. Come and meet your lord. The day the lord is come. Repent. Repent you sinners. Come and meet your lord. The day of the lord is come. Repent. Repent, you sinners. -Let's get out of here, chum. It's creepy. -We've come this far. Let's cover all of them. -All right, chum. You take that side and I'll take this. -Russ! Russ! -Oh-- Hurt much? Did you get to see what he looked like? Come on. I gotta get you into town, Johnny. -No. Give me just a minute, will you, pal? You know something, Watson? -What is it, chum? -I'm throwing in the towel. This guy's too tough for me. [SINGING] -Hiya, Beethoven. -How's the gladiator? -Well, a little creaky around the hinges. -Say, didn't you promise Fromm you'd be at headquarters this morning? -Mm-hmm. But I got some ideas I want to talk to you about. -About the murder? Don't tell me you're going to take back the towel you just threw in. -No, I found some more pieces that fit. -I'm all ears. -Russ, I was wondering how the murderer knew we were going to the cemetery last night. -Well, there's-- there's Smelly Annie, she's psychic. -No. No, none of the suspects knew our destination, and Anne didn't know. -You know, Johnny, she wouldn't be a bad kid to have across the breakfast table from you every morning. -Oh, no. No, you've forgotten the Webb pledge. I'm going to remain free from foreign entanglements. Why did you throw that thing at me last night? It hurt. You may have had good reasons for the other two, but-- -I'm sorry, Johnny. I just tried to scare you off, that's all. -It's funny. Now that I look back, all the things that pointed to you. Trying to frame me with the knife in the drawer-- -But it wasn't a frame, Johnny. It just backfired that way. I wanted you to think it was Cushing so you'd get him before I had to. -Why? What did you have against Cushing? -After Alma, Johnny, look. He got all of her stuff from the bank. The newspaper clippings, too. -And you stabbed a girl in the back just because she had a newspaper clipping? -She was trying to blackmail me. Now, wait a minute, Johnny. I know how you felt about Alma, but believe me, she's gone an awful long way down the road since you knew her. -Go on. -You know, amidst the 15 years of me doing what's right, she finally recognized me as the guy that knocked off her old man in the saloon fight. Ellis was an awful scum. He pulled a knife on me. Well, it so happened I was faster than he was, but the jury couldn't see it that way. I did a Houdini. -And Ater? That was hardly the way to get rid of her. -I couldn't give her two week's notice, could I? She saw me putting the knife in your desk. Don't look at me like that, will you, Johnny? Thou shalt not kill, huh? My government spent a lot of dough teaching me how to kill. For three years, I murdered guys I didn't have anything against. Finally, when I had a reason, it just came kind of easy, I guess. -I keep thinking how you gave it to Alma. -I couldn't let her turn me in. It's that waiting, Johnny, those long, drawn-out court trials waiting for the jury to come in. Then the death cellar, waiting and more waiting. Johnny, I'm not afraid to die, but it's got to be quicker than the legal way. -Well, that's that, I guess. -Johnny, look. Would you like to let me get to another state? Just for old times' sake, huh? -For old times' sake? You bed I'd like to. You'll never know how much, pal. But I don't think you understood when I said I was fond of Alma. I'm sorry. -Please, hurry! They're killing each other! [SIREN WAILING] -Oh, I'm sorry, pal. -It's better this way, Jack. Nice and quick. Thanks, chum. -Great stuff, Webb. Your girl told us about him. -Gee, Mr. Webb. -Nice work, Webb. -Is he dead? -You got the murderer! -The amendment went through. Joyce, Cushing and Godena, they measured for size. Why would that guy-- -Get out. Get out, all of you. Thanks, Puss. -Do you feel better now? -Sure, a lot better, Puss. -Well, then I guess I'll be getting along. -Yeah. Huh? -But before I go, I want to thank you for everything. Why, if it hadn't been for you, I might never have given this fella a second thought. -What fella? -Well, the college fella, remember? What you said. Oh, it isn't that he isn't handsome. 6'2'' and the biggest blue eyes, and the cute little dimples, and we thought that-- -Now you listen to me, Puss. How do I know who this moron is? Might even be a kidnapper or something. I know a lot of kidnappers that got blue eyes. -Well, no, he's a college boy. -Well, I'm not going to stand for it. I'm not going to let you throw yourself at the first good-looking half-bake that comes along. Might even have insanity in his family. -Mr. Webb, what-- -And stop calling me Mr. Webb. I don't care if he's 7'2'', a sophomore can't open a million charge accounts for you. Besides, you don't need a college boy. You need somebody you can depend on. You need a lawyer or something. [GASP] -Do they always ask that question about do you promise to obey? -How do I know? I don't get married every day. -Mr. Webb, I'm a victim of your technique. [THEME MUSIC]
