Kiss. Got it. Go on. Go on. Go. Go on! Go on! Bullshit. Is that him? I was in the same unit when it happened. Everyone knew he did it. He may have been a hard man once. He's just an old man now. Uh, Vehici Khadem, known as Viktor? You got any medical conditions or court cases coming up, Viktor? - No. - Right. Thanks, Viktor. Just step over there, would you, man? Paul Atherton? Eighteen years. So who's his lucky caseworker then? - Oh, piss off. - Oh, that'd be you, would it? Look. Stuff your accommodation list. - Hang on. What... What do we know? - That kid's a stand-up target. If he's sticking with Viktor, that's who we should put him in with. I agree. I'd be more worried about the kid. Keep them together. A cleanskin in with a diehard, yeah. That'll send him home a better man, won't it? We're a working farm here, gentlemen. You'll all be interviewed as to what's available. And an eight-hour working day is mandatory for everyone. Shit. Eight hours. Yeah, like the real world, Dave. Mr. Perry, Mr. Egan. Just thought I'd show the new arrivals around. I don't believe this is your room, Warren. Yes. No. Well, uh, I'll be in the utilities shed if anyone needs me. All right. Viktor, Paul. Drop your stuff. Grab a bunk. Settle yourselves in. A hundred bucks says it'll take him two weeks to come out of that room... without having to be told. Who was this man? Trustee? Who, Warren? Oh, don't you worry about Warren. No sweat there. Warren's a mate. No. This one my room. No one is coming here. Your room? In case you hadn't noticed, there's three of us in here... and I've been in here for months, so, if anything... Wash your clothes. Clean yourself. You are stinking, my friend. - Get rooted. - I don't share nothing with junkie. I'm not a junkie. The file says he hasn't had a visitor for 18 years, but that's got to be bullshit. No one doesn't have a visitor for that long. - Who's his next of kin? - Public trustee. He hasn't nominated anyone. All I can find so far is that the family were paid a visit by a prison counselor... 16 years ago, and they didn't want to know about him. Okay. You any idea what's gone on? Not yet, but I'll keep digging. - Hey, how's Sally? - Oh, she's okay. We're okay. Thanks, 'Chelle. Attention all prisoners. Five minutes to lockdown. Five minutes to lockdown. Prisoner count. All prisoners back to their units. It's lockdown, Viktor. Five minutes to lockdown, boys. I understand what you're saying, Warren, but I can't. He's watching me the whole time. - He watches bloody everything. - Just deal with it, Shane. - I don't pay a dog, and bark myself. - Yeah. - It's bullshit, mate. - But he just... You really think that old fart could have knocked a prick like Pete Ritchie? - You gotta work out where your priorities are. - Yeah. - It's just he stares at me the whole time. - Hey! Hey! Shane. He's just another stupid fuckin' wog, all right? - Now piss off and do what you're supposed to do. - Okay. And, Shane, you just remember who keeps the rest of them off your back, all right? Okay. Thanks, Warren. Prisoner lockdown. All prisoners back to their units. - Come on. Get your skates on, Dave. - Yes, Mr. Perry. I suppose SBS, be more your sort of go. Yeah. They got one of them Turkish films on tonight. He's from Iran. Mr. Egan? - Just need to take a dump, Mr. Egan. - Yeah, be quick. Yes, sir. Viktor's not the full quid, Mr. Perry. Barely even speaks English. Doesn't understand what you're asking him half the time. Yeah, yeah. Just cut the chat, Warren. Right. Clear it. Whoo! Is that it? Bit of an anticlimax. Righto. Unhook the chain. Come on. Get the chain off. I've got the stump. - Pull. - Good work, fellas. All right, boys, we need to be out of here in 10 minutes, okay? Hey! Over here! Oh, Jesus. Not another one. Okay, just hold back, guys. Oh, it's a bloody mess. Just finish her off, Shane. Go on. Finish her off. Viktor, back off. Let him go. Let him go, Viktor. Last chance. Okay, just settle down. Paul, I'm gonna need your shirt. Ted, you got the wire cutters? You gonna let him get away with that, sir? Okay. Now, I'm just gonna ease this over her head. - Okay. Now, can you hold her? Nice and firm. - Yeah. There's another one back here. Okay. - Okay, you got her? - Yeah. Okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Okay, mate. You can give her to me. Give her to me, Viktor. Okay. First and last warning, you do that again, you're out of here. - Nine bloody months? - Takes that long for their pinion feathers to grow back. Glenys, you've already got falcons on display. - If he can't be rehabbed, what then? - You tell me. You know you've got to cull him, and a few others too. That'll look good in the brochure. - We have to work with what we've got. - Exactly. Any fractures? And I can't justify any more space for the birds. Not if you're just gonna keep them on display, no. As opposed to what? We have a huge arena there for every other animal. Why not the birds? - Doing what? - Go on. Show him. Hello and welcome, everyone. Boys and girls, mums and dads... You picked your time. Well, if it helps, I've got an inmate who nearly throttled... the last bloke who tried to cull. Good. You've gotta be joking. Really gonna get this past the board. We're not a bloody circus, Glenys. It's an educational program based on natural behavior. For Christ's sake, it's in conflict with everything we're supposed to stand for. Come on, Morrie. No one likes seeing the big birds tethered. Seeing them fly, now that could be a big attraction. - And how much with that cost? - Not as much as it could earn. Jesus! You want to turn that loose on the public? It's only you, Morrie. He loves everyone else. - It's gonna need a wash. - Rightio. - Thanks, Paul. - Mr. Perry. The bird will live? Maybe. Hmm. - What are her chances? - The way things are around here, stuff all. Unless you get on your bike. I'm workin' on it. And Glenys doesn't have a problem. You know, she says she can train us. We can build it up past the south wing. There'll be eight small aviaries, one large one. We can make it out of what's in the utility yard, so it's not going to cost us anything. I think this could be a good news story for us, boss. Good for the department. Why do you think I keep letting you pitch me this crap? We can't afford to pull crews off reforestation. And you're not pulling funding for my boys' clocks, which, as you know, earns us a dollar. This isn't going to take anything away from existing programs. It'll just give them another place to stash their gear. Okay, anyone else got anything to say? Yeah. Who's gonna run it? - I was thinking Viktor Khadem. - Jesus. I've got to provide him with some kind of work program. Start him making his own decisions. Yeah, he's already shown a bit of talent for that. Made the decision to iron bar Pete Ritchie back in Pentridge. He was never charged with that, Trav. There are enough idiots in here who'll try pushing him. Okay, you want him? Anyone? Come on. Feel free, please. Any takers? Look, he wouldn't have made it here to minimum... if he hadn't had a clean slate for the last four years. All right. You got it off your chests. Let's make it work. Bloody amazing how your mouth opens, and all that bullshit drops straight out of it. Oh, yeah, is that right? The only thing you left out was that raptors are sacred hunting birds where Viktor comes from. Yeah, well, they are, in that part of the world. Main reason you want Viktor is because you're counting on the rest of them... being too shit scared of him to trash your birds. Yeah, you reckon that hasn't crossed the governor's mind too? He still can't go through a door without being told. - I hope you got that hundred bucks waiting for me. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Nah. Let's make it double or nothing, on how fast he gets you in the shit. It's pretty sweet here, mate. Those dickheads. They're not screws. They're just bloody farmers. You need anything here, you just ask me. You want in with the good jobs, that can be arranged too. You've just got to say the word, Viktor... No, no, no. I no going to do nothing. I don't need nothing. What you think you will tell me, I don't know. It's up to you, Vik. - Just makin' the offer. - Okay. Now, it'll be your responsibility. The aviaries, the feed house. Keeping it all clean. But mainly care of the birds. What privilege I get? You give me my own room? Well, possibly. But it'd be conditional. - You help me, I help you. - Mmm. Now, it'll need a crew of three. So what you need to think about is... who you want working with you. You want me to choose? Well, you'll want to keep your turf in one piece, won't you? You can watch them for an hour, and not see a wing beat. If this go wrong, I going to lose my room? Well, it depends on how it goes wrong. But, yeah, you might. Hey. I knew it was bullshit he's got no one. He's got a 23-year-old son, who's an accountant for a start. So, where's he been for the last 18 years? What's the problem? We're talking a good Iranian family. Guess who Viktor murdered. His best friend. Bad as it gets. - So, what do we do? - Ah, don't know. Leave it with me. Attention, prisoners. Those with parole meetings report to the office. Mr. Perry. You got something to tell me yet? I'll have Paul. He do good job. - Agreed. Who else? - And Shane. That one. Any particular reason? Yeah. I have to watch him all the time. Keep where I can see he don't make trouble for me. Fair enough, just as long as you know what you've got. Shane. Anderson. Puck. Neil. He's a top little dog, mate. - He yours? - She. She got a name? What's the go with you, Pauly? Huh? You one of them foster kids or something? Like... Like me and me brother? You know, if my old lady sent me a letter, I think I'd be too fuckin' scared to open it. Because I'd be scared that she'd put broken glass in it or something. "I wish you would at least have a word with your dad. He's taking it pretty hard. He doesn't know what to make of things." Geez, Pauly. That doesn't sound too bad. You keep your hands off my things, asshole. Shane. Paul. You're wanted up in the office. Righto. Now! Sorry, sir. He's picked you. You've been told. No. No. Shit no, Mr. Perry, not with Viktor... It's done, Shane. Live with it. All right. What are we talking? Is this a five dollar a day job or what? We'll talk about that later. - All right. - That's all. You can go. Okay. Thanks, Mr. Perry. Stick around, Paul. You spoken to your folks yet? - No. - Well, that's up to you, Paul. But you're racking up a lot of unused phone calls. Paul. A couple of saplings just through there, Mr. Perry. There's another one over there, maybe three, four mils off. - Righto, Shane. - I reckon they'll do. Look at him. Tidies up the yard. Tidies up the canteen. Now he's tidying up the bush. Well, that's Islam for you, mate. More rules in the Koran about being clean and tidy than you and I'd know what to do with. You've been reading again, have you? You know, all this is going to count towards your parole. Something you need to start thinking about. You have any idea where you might live, or who you could go to? Nah. I don't have no one. Well, that's not the case, Viktor. What about your son? No, I don't have son. He don't want to know me. Well, actually he's okay to come and see you. How'd you feel about that? He won't come. I no good for him. What if he does? Then, I'll... I'll swap you for Thursday. It's The Footy Show, mate. It doesn't get any fairer than that. Besides, you gotta see these WWF chicks, man. Far out. They're pumped up, but they still got their, you know... - It's not mine. - Don't keep your shit in here. Last time you do job for Warren. Viktor, please. You don't understand what's going on here. Viktor, please! You're bloody crazy. Please, Vik. Please. You think I don't know, huh? You live here. You are mine. - You don't know what he'll do. - You want I tell him? No problem. Shit! Someone needs to have a chat with someone... before something happens to someone. You didn't say, "Please." Warren. Shane. What's the story? Uh, I don't know. He just pissed Warren off, Mr. Egan. Now you can tell me here, or you can tell me up at the office, where everyone's gonna see you. Up to you. You know what that mad fuckin' Arab did? He went and flushed Warren's stash. Well, that's what Shane reckons. What's Warren think about that? He's lifted the ban on Shane. Well, go on. You picked Shane. I warned you about him. And now you've put him in the shit. - What can I do, Mr. Perry? - Do you know what he's in here for? I don't care. He's junkie. All junkie got no brain. Don't care what they do. They steal from family. Kill you for 10 cent. Yeah, well, he... he did kill someone. He killed his own kid. - Kill his own child? - No, no. It was an accident. Accident, of course. Always accident. Mine was accident too, Mr. Perry. Mate, it was an accident. He's in here for manslaughter. Hmm. He got stoned. He had a fight with his girlfriend. And he reversed the car out of the drive over his own child. When I kill my friend, I drunk. Crazy. He say something. Bring shame. I can't walk away. Little kid. What he do to anyone? Mate, when someone's dead, the story isn't whether you think they had it coming or not. Come on. You know better than that. Look at me. Can't you even look at me? Because I want to know why you ripped the shit out of our lives. How you could do that to Mum and me. When Mum got kicked out of the house, we had nowhere to go. Do you know what that's like? You shamed us so bad, her own brother wouldn't have us. None of the family. Half the community even blamed her for what you did. With your cousin, Danush. He's been my father, not you. They looked after Mum when she was dying. Yeah, not that you give a shit. You didn't even come to her funeral. And you could have. You got permission. But you wouldn't even give her that much. Yeah, that's your answer for everything. Got my own wife and kid now. And you're not coming near us. Righto. I'll be right back. That went well. At least I finally told the bastard what he did to us. Good. You needed to do that. I don't ever want to see him again. That's understandable. How's the baby? Sorry. Yousef, none of this is your fault, not back then and not today. It's really important you know that. You can know it. But it doesn't feel that way when you're a kid. - I'm sorry it didn't work out... - Why you make me do this? What you want? Mate, you're gonna really need to work out what you want to... get out of this place. What you want. He's my son. - Wow. - Pretty good, eh? You guys did this? Yes. Was a big job. This is the one from here? She comes back to you. Her name's Yasmine. Just be ready. Jesus! Fuck! Fuck, I'm never fucking going in there. - Behave yourself. - Sorry. Neither would I. She's Glenys's bird at the moment. Nothing's scarier than taking over someone else's raptor. The important thing is not to let the wing muscles atrophy. You've got to walk her every day. Just keep her moving. - What happened to her? - Shh. It's okay. It's okay. We've got to keep things quiet around them to start with. New territory, strangers. It freaks them out. It's just CO2 gas. They die quick and painless. The reason you cut them up is so your bird can see the meat. Right. The eagle won't eat mice or pellets. She's gonna need rabbits, small foxes, that sort of thing. So who gets the rats? Uh, falcons, buzzards, hawks. They're not here yet. That's good. Let me introduce you to somebody. Now this... is Baz. He's my best. You want to say hello? No touching or petting, ever. The big thing, Viktor, is keeping them wild for release. We only handle them for treatment. Yeah, but what about our privileges? What do we get? You want? You have to work for. Same like me. I tell you one thing. I look after you. You look after him. The trouble with you is your guts. Keep stuffing yourself, what are you gonna do when we turn you loose? You'll have to walk away. You know what my old man used to say? You kids are about one roast potato short of me... having to cart you around in a wheelbarrow. Still held the record though. You finished? I tell him yesterday, "Clean up." I tell him day before. Look at this. Geez, she's never done that before. - What you bloody do? - What? - How many time I tell you be quiet for the bird? - I never said a bloody word. Fuck it! You don't do nothing I'm asking. You don't clean right. You don't looking after nothing. Where the big rat go? - I told you. I don't know. - How you lose him? He's big rat. I count, you know. You don't do good job, you piss off. - Oh, yeah, like I got somewhere to go, mate. - Huh? - Like I got somewhere to go! - You want eight dollar a day, have to work. Bludger Aussie. - Why don't you just do what he asks you to do? - Ah, for what? I could bust myself, and it still wouldn't be good enough. Shit. You better piss off. Good day, Warren. You want a witness? You know what happens to witnesses. How long have you been in the system for, son? Five minutes? Heard you've done it tough. Come on, Warren. It's got nothing to do with him. Well, I'll give you a break this time, because as far as I know, he's not a dog. Shane, you're a dog. - I'm not a dog. - You're stupid too. You haven't worked it out yet, have you, Shane? You're just being used. Viktor's got his own room out of it. What did you get out of it? - You just sold out for nothing. - I told you. - He took it off me, and he flushed it. - It's true. I was there. I helped you out with your little problem. And this is how you pay me back. It sets a real bad example. Now that hooch cost me money. So, you've either gotta work it off, or pay it off. That's only reasonable, isn't it? I'll work it off. I'll work it off. - Okay, good, because I have a couple of little jobs for you. - All right. Now you just tell your mate here how much harder it can get. Okay. All right, Warren. Thanks, Warren. All right, Shane. Mr. Perry, better take a look at this. There are a dozen of these. Uh, check room 16 for eccies and "H." A couple of these. Ask the Arab how he gets the gear in. Standover allegations. Someone's not happy with Viktor. Trouble with the raptor program? I know what this is about. It's got nothing to do with the birds. I'm not interested in what you know. If there's anything going on, I want it nipped in the bud. Since when do we get jumpy about an organized campaign in the inmates' dob box? Complaints about the food are one thing. Any suggestion that we flick off reports about hard drugs is something else, especially now we have these bloody monthly inspections. Away you go. Anything in it, I want him shanghaied straight out of here. - Any takers? - Yeah, that little prick Shane for a start. All clear. Have you thought about what you might do if you lose him? No. Viktor's too much of an old hand to be caught with something planted on him. Yeah, especially if someone tipped him off. Something I can do for you, Vik? I do favor for you. I tell you how you stay out of trouble. What sort of trouble do you reckon you'd still be up for, old man? Nowhere you can put nothing I don't find. Nothing you can think of, I don't think it first. You give me trouble, I see far away coming. I give you trouble, you don't see nothing. Vik, mate. You just don't get it, do you? This isn't the big house. You're never gonna last here. No one has to do a thing. You'll do it all yourself. It's disappointing. Hope his brother can make it this time. Someone been feeding you happy pills, Trav? Get off. They're twins. - You know, that telepathy shit. - Yeah. I wouldn't cut Shane any slack if I were you, mate. Why you don't go there? Your family not here? They don't want to see you? What for ringing Mr. Perry all the time? Did he tell you that? He comes all the time tell you. What you think, I don't see? Why you don't talk to them? None of your business. You don't know them. Looks to me you don't want to see them. Just leave it, okay? If it was me is make big worry in my mind always. How I gonna look to my father. What he gonna see when he look at me. What he will figure out. He loves you. He sees nothing. Hey, Vik. Just making sure it's all locked up. You don't touch the bird when I'm not here. Yeah, all right. Just keep your bloody shirt on. I'm just trying to do my job. I mean, geez. You're the one who cracked the shits because it wasn't good enough. Viktor! It's stiff as a board. Must have happened last night. - Looks like his neck's been wrung. - What's going on? - What you think... - Get him off me! Get him off me! Get him off! - Let him go! - What are you doing? - You do this? Huh? - No way. No way, Viktor. What are you doing? You're a psycho! You psycho! Get him off me! - You're a psycho! - Back off. - Stuff this! Stuff this! - Walk away, Shane. Stuff the birds! And stuff you! Show me where you found him exactly. Paul. Up there. Just here. - Put up quite a fight. - Against what? Another raptor. A hawk. Maybe something bigger. - Mm-mmm. - It's lured him up to the net and made a grab for him. - These birds are highly territorial. - No, no, no. I know he do this. - Mr. Perry, I see him here... - You don't know! Put a sock in it, and start listening to someone who does. Look. Here. These are talon wounds. And this did not come from this bird. See for yourself. I've seen it before, Viktor. This was not man-made. Could be a goshawk. So, uh, what are your intentions? You gonna lay a complaint? Well, I could, couldn't I, Mr. Perry? - I mean, I've got me rights. - Well, it's up to you, Shane. Only, it'd stuff up the whole bird program, wouldn't it? Least if I had me own room, maybe that would be some sort of compensation. - Stick it up your ass, Shane! - Okay. How about you pull your head in, and I won't send you back to bush clearing detail. And Warren. Okay. I'll just be at the physio if anyone needs me. Sir. So, what's he gonna do? Nothing. He's decided it's not in his best interests. Well, that's not an option for us anymore. Viktor's gotta go. Come on, Terry. Okay, he's crossed the line, but he's had a shitload of provocation to deal with, and he's making a program you thought was beyond us work. They want you gone. And I'm not putting myself out for you if you abuse my trust. What you want me to do? I do it. We'll go and see the social worker for a start. Show me you're serious. - What I will tell to her? - Why don't you sign up for her anger management course? - My English no good, Mr. Perry. - Then sign up for the literacy course too. You can be out of here in two seconds, and you won't be coming back. Okay. I'll see what I can do to keep you here. But you're gonna have to convince me you're worth it. Mate, I have done anger management four times. I got past projecting blame in a week. Viktor? He's back in denial. Four times? Yeah. It's like a diploma course, you know? You know what, Vik? A bit of landscaping would be the go around here. Dress it up a little bit. Used to be a chippie once. I'd be happy to do it. You know? Lay something down here. A couple of tree ferns there. Wouldn't take much. What do you think, Vik? You know? Just a beautiful wooden path all the way down, you know, because I think that brick would probably be a little bit too slippery in the wet. What do you reckon, Vik? Reckons he'll break me, and I'll piss off. That's what he's doin'. Well, then, give it a rest. Don't keep pushing it with him. Viktor's gonna kill you if he finds out where that went. Well, he nearly did. That's how he caught me the other night down at the mouse house, because I forgot little Baz's food pellets. Good night, Baz. That's where you're stashing your gear, isn't it? Now, don't you get too interested. Coming through, boys. Take a walk, Paul. - Jesus, you're a stupid little bastard. - I'm sorry, Mr. Perry. We just had a call from your mum. Oh, yeah? What did the old bitch want now? - You got any other family you could call on? - What for? It's about your brother, Jeff. What about him? He's had another serious asthma attack. The ambulance didn't make it on time. I'm really sorry, Shane. Apparently, he was admitted to St. Vincent's Hospital at 2:00 this afternoon, but, uh, it was too late. Now, that's all we know. So you should make a phone call. Talk to someone in your family because they'll know all the details. No. There's no one I want to talk to. You want to see the social worker? No. I think you should. Maybe have a think about it, yeah? Let me know. So he's dead? Yes, he is. You can come back in, Paul. You let me know about the social worker, okay? Geez, I'm sorry, mate. It's the last thing I want to be doing is holding his hand at his brother's funeral. A little bit late to be thinking about that now. - Come on. I'll owe you one. - No, no, no. Not interested. You're the escort. Jesus, you're a prick. How many times have I covered for you? I said straight-up when this case-worker shit started. It's a crock. You can't hold a bastard's hand and discipline them at the same time. You can't do it. Look, I'm the wrong person to do this, Leo. I can't stand him and he knows it. Then you should have refused his case load when you knew what he was back in for. - Don't go there. - Mate, you think about what you're doing. You lose a kid to cancer, and he kills his. You reckon you can handle that? You're a bloody idiot. I think it's about time, Shane. The old bitch is tanked. So's my sister. Look at her. You'll be right once you get in there. Not sure I can handle this on my own, Mr. Perry. Good day, Mum. Change your clothes. Got big job. Prick. Someone stuffed up, didn't they, asshole? Got the wrong brother. What am I supposed to do with that? You're the chippie with the big plan. - You want to build something? - Half that wood's crap. - Have to get it sorted. - No, this one's good. What about metal stakes to peg it down? I mean, I can't even start without that. You tell me. I'll get for you. Hey. You wanna know a secret? Yeah? Viktor's all smoke and no fire. Everyone reckons he's a tough old bugger. Yeah. But he's worse than my old man at bluffing it. Just feeding her. She gets a bit pushy.Hmm. Is time for her. Huh? - No way. She's not ready. - Yeah, she ready. Mr. Perry say she ready too. She good strong bird. It's too soon. She'll never handle it. Well, she mightn't if we wait much longer either. You've done a good job with her, Paul. Time to let her go. No, I know this bird. I look after her. She's still stiff in the wings. A couple of pinions aren't fully grown yet. How's she gonna hunt? It's Viktor's call. Glenys agrees. She your bird. You do. All right. Yeah. Sit it here. Yeah, come on, babe. Go on. Let her go. Over here. Not moving. Probably a roosting spot. She must be over here. Here. Come on. Give us a leg up. All right, just take it easy. Shit, if he falls, we're talking departmental investigation. Compensation claims. The ombudsman. My job too. Better make sure he fall on you then, boss. Hang in there. Hang in there, okay? - She there? - Yeah. All right. - She looks fine. - Yeah? Found her own nesting spot and everything. Any sign she's fed? Well, she mightn't have made a kill yet. Still getting her bearings. - Good start though, eh? - Yeah. Well done. Just doesn't make sense... up the bloody chimney. I mean, if he's not in the ground, then where is he? Don't know. Heaven, or wherever, I suppose. Once they're dead, mate, that's it. You're stuffed. Not a bloody thing you can do about it. - You didn't knock someone, did you? - Shit, no. Well, I... I didn't mean to. It was an accident. Yeah, me too. No. It was my fault. I was drunk when I hit him. I know what you mean. Four days, Mr. Perry. Can't go longer than this. Maybe I make mistake. Maybe I should listen to Paul. Well, it's good you're taking responsibility, but don't expect it to work out every time. Maybe I'm thinking too much about what he did... instead of the bird. - What do you think? - What? Oh. Yeah. Great. Well, don't get too bloody excited. You reckon I should put the date? Yeah. You're right. It's good as it is. She's gonna be all right. She's done it. She's gone and done it. Far out. The first bird off the rank. So what was all the fuss about? Thanks for getting me out of bed. Yeah, Glenys, don't be so grumpy. You loved it. What else would you be doing? Watching midnight murder mysteries or something like that. That's what you'd be doing. You clean this. All this have to be cleaned. New bird don't like if she think this one still around. That one too. Viktor, you got something to say, just say it. You think bird be your friend, fix your life? It's no good you touch the owl. We just here to fix the bird. Well, shit, Viktor, I stuff up, so she got chucked out to maybe starve? What was that about? Same for her, same for you. Same for me. Everyone have to go out from here sometime. Maybe okay, maybe no. You don't do again. Come on. Do your job. What you think, I want to be your friend? There's a whole tribe of bunnies down by the dam. My wife counted about 50 the other day. They come in after the cattle feed. Should be enough to keep Yasmine topped up. How many kids do you have, Mr. Perry? None. Best time of day here, I reckon. Ah, it's nice here, this place. Good life. Yeah. You took him home? Well, no, not into the house, for Christ's sake. You're crossing the line with him, mate. You're doing it again. Look, back off, Leo. It might be good enough for you just to sit on your arse and turn keys. - You see that? Does it say "social worker"? - No. No, dickhead. It says "prison officer." You forget that, and these pricks will burn you every time. The longer you leave it, the greater risk of failure when you turn them loose. Same as the birds. Yeah, that's all very well, Matt, but there's other considerations, and it's a bit sooner than I'd like to see. He's maturing in his handling of people and situations. And it's due to him that the birds are looking like a success. I think he's well and truly earned it. I agree. But is he ready to start escorted day release? No question. The more time we spend working him up to the outside world, the better. I'll back Matt's judgment on it. There's still the problem of where he's going to go... on this unescorted day release. Think we might have an ally. I reckon another couple of inches, those feathers will be hard penned, mate. Got your travel arrangements. Now, Yousef's got a copy too, so you and I can go through it in the next couple of days. Okay? Mr. Perry, I can't go with nothing. My son do big gift for me. If I bring nothing, what he gonna think? I don't respect him? His wife? All right, so how big a deal is that? - What, flowers, something like that? - From me. My heart. I don't have nothing for that. Gonna go and see your family, Vik? Thought you might want my... leather jacket. It's a good one. Right. G'day, then. You know, your son's been on the phone all day. What, you didn't even turn up? That was a bright idea... fast-tracking a long-termer. Yes, thank you, Mr. Egan. I'm well aware of that. He's clear on the urine test, but not the alcohol. - What'd he blow? - .13. Piss weak effort for five hours. So where are we shanghaiing him out to? We're not. He's stripped of all privileges as of now and straight back to square one. Put him in sick bay for the night. I wouldn't go there, mate. You need a degree in politics. I don't want the program collapsing around my ears, Matt. You said yourself he's the one that makes it work. Yeah, but he's just shown he could bring it all down. That'd be a hell of a waste of all the experience he's racked up. I don't know. Paul can handle it. He's capable, knows the ropes. At least he can be trusted. This isn't getting a little personal with you, is it? Yeah, you bet it is. Mate, he took me for a sucker. What, would you lie down for that? Yeah, so just take it slowly, all right? Remember, you've got the food, so don't turn your back on her until she's used to it. You need a hand, we call Glenys. How long till Viktor's coming back? As far as the birds are concerned, never. Forget it, girl. I'm not allowed to have anything to do with him. I cleaned it. Yeah, I cleaned that too. Look, mate, I've only got eight weeks to go. Last thing I want is any trouble. So however you want things, okay? - That one your TV? - Yeah. But hey, help yourself. No, you watch. I don't care. After all the crap that he has given me, and who comes back pissed as a fart? What do you have to do to work your way back once you've stuffed up like that? Viktor? He hasn't got a rat's. You gotta do the rehab. You gotta suck on the psychs. You gotta learn how to remorse. Viktor's not even smart enough to beat the breath test. Have a look at that. What for? Gonna buy one. Me and me brother were. Come on, mate, they gotta be at least a million. Bullshit. 350 thou. And look. You don't need nothing to get started. Righto. Including 12 months' bloody corporate fees. - What's that? - Don't know. But there's got to be stacks of building jobs up there. Well, that'll be the bloody end of the salmonella. Who picked this place for him? Occupational health and safety. That'd be your nose you're cutting off. Mate, he didn't just stuff up. He went straight for the grog that got him in here in the first place. - I'm shocked. - Yeah. Only one chance with you, is it? You wanna have a good look around. No one here can jump that bar. Well, it's better than no chance, Leo, which is all they get on offer from you. True. So I hope you're enjoying Spirits of the Sky. Now circling around our flight arena at the moment is Rimmer. Is it always this packed? Yeah, most of the time. They can always find money if they think they're gonna make more. I'm bringing you out a falcon, another owl, maybe a pair of kestrels. - All right. - So you'd better warn Viktor. We've made a bit of a change. I've... I've had to take Viktor off the birds. What the hell did you do that for? He stuffed up his day release. I don't care what he's done. You can't lose him. He gets it. He's got a real gift for the birds. It's hard to find. Well, I'm sorry. That's the way it is. Well, bloody change it. Hello, everyone. I'd like you to meet Millie. Like the other birds in this show, she was badly injured... and can't be returned to the wild. You need to understand. Nothing might get you back on the birds. Yeah. But still I try. What about your son? You let him down big time too. It's for him I... I have to try. But I can't bloody write nothing. Okay. You take your time. - I'll write it down for you. - Okay. I want to tell him why I don't go to his mother funeral. It's because I bring shame. My family, they don't want me there. I understand that. If I go... who else will be there for her, for Yousef? No one go to her funeral if I go. My son is good man. He have... a family. He have good wife. Give him beautiful baby daughter. Mr. Perry is good man. He do a lot for me, give me chance. And I don't do nothing for them. Only I bring trouble. You know which one I reckon we should get? This one on the corner on the second floor. Any of them come with a mooring? - What for? - Wouldn't mind having a boat. Like your old man's? No. That's a trawler. Couldn't afford that. Worth a buck, is he? Well, the boat is. It's his living. Him and me. Him now. - Hey, Glenys. - Matt. - Hi. - How are you? - How's the big girl going? - Fine. Went off her food for a bit, but seems to be back on track. No, she hasn't attached. You're the feeder and she's not focused on you at all. No. She's watching him. I told you. And you sure as hell can't have anyone else release her. Cleaning, cleaning. All the go with you Muzzos, isn't it? Well, when you're not bombing the shit out of us, that is. So it's all right for you lot to get ripped, is it? Is that it? Is it all right for you, huh? - Is that it, huh? Is that it... - Hey. Go on. I told you. Leave him alone. See, that how's you do it, Vik. The farmers just want to do the job easy. You keep it sweet, they don't see too much. Anyone who doesn't get that... going to end up a poor motherless loser like you. Hey, Pauly! Mate, can you grab the footy tipping sheet off the wall there? Time to put the tips in. How many did you get last week? - I don't know. - Two. You got two. You got two. I got eight. I have to talk with you, Paul. - Yeah, but... - Don't worry for Shane. He no make problem for me, but will be big problem for you. Yeah, he can be a dickhead sometimes. - He's also a mate. - Huh? You lost your brain? What you think? He don't do nothing for you. - Hey, what do you know about what he's done for me? - I know him. You stay with him, you finish the same. He belong here. You, no. This home for him. You have a good family. You have a chance. You go out from here, you don't come back. Oh, what he's doing in there? Your job, at a rough guess. - Oh, he's going to get locked down. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't stop him. If Viktor wants to break them up, then let him. - Someone's got to. - What do you mean? You're the kid's caseworker, mate. Open your eyes. Paul with Shane and Warren. Join the bloody dots. I need to let her go. For Christ's sake, Matt, you gave me 50 good reasons... why you wanted him off the birds. Yeah, that was then, but, uh... Look, he's been making a real effort. He's-He's put himself into the rehab course. He's been seeing Michelle. And, well, he's taken on a lot more than I've given him credit for. You haven't got trouble brewing down at the aviaries, have you? No. No, I've just... I've just woken up to a few things, that's all. Might need him back in his own room where he can keep an eye on things. Get out of here. So if you wanna be reinstated, that's up for consideration. Yes, I want, Mr. Perry. Okay. And a keener eye on Paul wouldn't hurt either. Ah, Shane no good for him. Agreed. So if you can put the brakes on it, all well and good. Paul got big problem in his head. - I don't know how you fix. - Yeah. He won't see family, talk with father. Will be parole in six months. He don't fix, it be too late. I know. Why you don't bring father to him? No. 'Cause he's got his rights, and that'd be crossing the line. Let's talk about the conditions of minimum security, Warren. You don't need to remind me, Mr. Perry. I'm not the one who flouted the rules. They go from live and let live to zero tolerance in the blink of an eye. Bear that in mind. You bear that in mind. No. I mean, that's not a fair cop, Mr. Perry. I mean, we do all the work... and then he just walks back in here and he takes all the credit. - Maybe if we had $10 a day. - Live with it, Shane. Paul's all right with it. Well, if anyone's going to handle her release, better him than me. Well, welcome back, Vik. What you think, I gonna play with you? Hey. Yeah. Did you write this, or did she? I don't know what to believe anymore. Were you expecting him? No. Just got straight in the car and came. Why are you doing this? What do you want from me? I want you to know this man. I think here's good. Okay. She's all yours. This is your home. Yalla. Yeah, she's got it now. She's looking for a thermal. I reckoned prison must have hardened him, but it's not that, is it? No, he's a good kid. He's a hard worker. He's doing a top job with the birds too. You gonna tell me what's happened to him? You asking? Just wanna take him home. Ran himself into some power lines, they tell me. Made quite a mess of the poor little beggar. Got your work cut out patching him up, from the look of it. Yeah. G'day, Dad. Why she is staying in one place? She needs big room to catch food. Just getting her bearings, maybe. It could take her more than a week to make her first kill. If she stays here, why we don't see her sometime? Thanks, Dave. Viktor, it's not your fault. She's just one of those birds that can't be released. It's no way of knowing till you try. We'll take her back to the sanctuary. She won't be put down. I'll give you my word on that. It happens, mate. He's not the same man. I'm gonna put it to Vander anyway. You'd make a bloody fortune if you were selling used cars. Turned a corner, my arse. Oh, well, if it gets him back on the day release program. Never look too deeply into the abyss, my friend, or the abyss will look back into you. You're right. Nietzsche. I read too, you know. I check those little quotes on the bottom of my desk calendar every day. Okay, pick up a ball. The black-spotted one. You know what your problem is, Shane? You don't think things through. You don't see the big picture. What picture? Well, Viktor's gonna be gone soon. And you'll still be here. Don't count on it. Where's Shane? Don't want to eat? Yeah. He's coming. You tell him what that sooky owl of yours just did? Not yet. Gave that falcon what for. Now, there's a decision you can't call back. What's the hurry, sirs? Hey. Oh, what's going... What are you looking for? By all means, knock yourself out. Come in. Mr. Egan, what are you looking for? Hey, you're not gonna find anything. Hey, watch it. - Mr. Egan, I help you out and this is what I get. - Yeah. You know damn well it makes me a target... - for every dickhead who wants to pay you out. - Mr. Egan. Found it. - Hey. That... No, that's a setup. - You're out of here. 'Cause you know I never would've put it in a stupid fucking spot like that, Mr. Egan! How many charges do you want, pal? So what do you think? Viktor's last word on the subject, or is Warren really that stupid? They're all that bloody stupid, given half a chance. - What's going on? - Hey! Hey, Viktor! - I don't know, Mr. Perry. - You filthy dog! I'm gonna cut you up, you piece of shit! I'm gonna find you, I'm gonna cut ya! I'm gonna cut you up, you piece of shit! Then I'm gonna find your bird, and I'm gonna cut your bird! Viktor, you piece of shit! Viktor! Well, if you don't go for parole, you'll be serving your full term, which could be another two years. Maybe they won't give to me. Well, it's gonna depend on you. There's certain things the parole board will want to hear. What I should say to them? I kill my friend. I shame my family. Oh, yeah. The truth's always a good place to start. Mr. Perry, for you I have clean heart. Ah... You ask me, I tell you anything. Is that a fact? Okay. Did you really do that hit on Pete Ritchie in Pentridge? No. But better for me if everyone believe. Yeah, I thought that might be the story. - Why you ask? - Oh, I just wanted to hear it from you. Hey, Viktor, be careful. Watch her. Run, run. Run, run, run, run. Run, run, run. She okay. Run, run, run. - Viktor, stop her. - She have to try. Run, run. Run, run. She don't try, how she learn to fly? Hi, everyone. Welcome to Spirits of the Sky. Now, you may not realize it, but you are in the presence of the master adapter. The true ruler of the Australian skies. Meet Yasmine. Now, wedge-tailed eagles... have up to two tons of crushing power in their talons... and a wingspan of up to two and a half meters. They are extremely territorial. They mate for life... and can live up to around 50 years of age. Viktor. Go on. Call her down. Yes? Thank you. You know what to do. Call the bird down. Come and see the bird. Go and sit in there. Go and sit in there. They'd both do well here. Yeah? Really? You never know.
