November 25, Monday Get up at 6:30 in the morning Waking up on Monday morning is the hardest thing in a week. Winter Monday morning is the hardest of the year In addition, although the alarm ring every 5 minutes from 6 am I never get up at 6 Getting up at 6 is ideal Getting up at 6:30 is reality Women have to do a lot after getting up In order to relieve some of the depression of going out to work Music is essential I made a playlist for the 1hour journey from home to company The earphones fell in the pocket of the coat I wore yesterday Dryness is the enemy for women Especially for me whose lips are very dry The lip balm is also in yesterday’s coat pocket For this reason I don’t know how many times I bought a new lip balm In other words My own fault saved my life Maki and I take the same train The place we get on bus is different and meet at the station So cold I really don't want to go to work Is there any way to cure Monday blues? Really blue I've been blue since Sunday evening Winter blues doubles Winter Monday should be set as a public holiday Yes She and I have similar values ​​so we can easily talk What if Monday in winter is set as a public holiday. Don’t you feel depressed when you go to work on Tuesday? Yes, Tuesday blues now In other words I'll start to be depressed on Monday evening How it feels on Sunday evening now, right? Or also change it to a holiday on Tuesday. Yeah But this way, will be Wednesday blues Also closed on Wednesday Understood But this way Will be the problem of Thursday blues Then holiday. Okay, thank you So it's turn for Friday blues What should we do? But if I take a rest even on Friday, There won't be any day to work So bear it on Friday Yes. Thank you Can it start in the afternoon? Of course Thanks Winter Monday issue We unanimously agree to rest six days a week But I may hate summer more Really? Don’t it feel hard to squeeze a train in the morning? Full train in summer morning The smell is unbearable Can't stand it You can wear more clothes if it's cold If it smells, it can't be helped Indeed It turns out that Mondays all year are bad Super blue By the way, if this blues can be converted into mileage I can almost go to Hawaii We can go to France in business class This many? All accumulated France is so good I want to go. You want to go, right? Haven't you been? No. France is very good Has Sae been there? No I watched it in the show "Seeing the World from Car Window" Super nice Is that so? how to say... I wanted to complain, "You haven't been there." But in this way, the focus of the conversation now will change So I don't tell her. Maki probably thinks so too. Good morning There seems to be a flower road And on the beach, people would sit on it and read It must be great to relax in a swimsuit like that Isn't it enjoyable? Very enjoyable Yes Walk inside and take a look... Eh, I like Australia Australia? Australia was broadcast on the previous late night show Super nice How about the 7day tour in Australia? 7 days tour is very good I want to go Australia is good But it’s hard to give up Tahiti Tahiti? Bora Bora Island in Tahiti It is said to be the last paradise in the world Awesome In what show did you see it? I went there about 5 years ago I wanted to complain, "Haven't you already been there?" But the focus of the conversation now will change so I better don't say. Everyone may think so Isn't it pretty? Amazing The sea is so beautiful What is this? There are coral reefs over there. Then choose Tahiti Choose Tahiti Yeah, after all, it’s the last paradise in the world Yes Bora Bora I have a rare opportunity to go for a 10day tour I want to go. I want, I want. Blues Miles Exchange Act Unanimously agreed to go to Bora Bora, Tahiti You can swim to the fullest So awesome there are turtles over there 8:40 morning meeting Good morning By the way, the order of the circle formation is not fixed But everyone always stands in the same position I keep standing here No special reason Of course it’s okay not to stand here Just in the circle Standing here or there is personal freedom But I keep standing here Everyone is the same Among them Some people will stand in different positions This one.... Hiroshige The longest waiting time of 29 visiting customers... He usually stands there He stood there last week, Friday, Thursday and before But I don’t know why he's here today The location is not fixed, so it’s okay But it just makes people feel a little uncomfortable This is also the magic of Monday No Even on Tuesday, it’s still upsetting Open at 9am Welcome Today is relatively free This is the only consolation On number 6, please The lunch break is taken by rotation I probably understand how you feel I understand that one Although the position is not fixed But I feel a little unhappy What are you talking about? At the morning meeting today Ikki (once) is in a different location than usual Right? I'm so unhappy Right? Because Ikki is there I also have to stand a little aside That really makes people uncomfortable So today, Sakaki, you will stand there Right, Maki must stand there too, right? That's all his to blame Yes Just because he changed the position Everyone has to fine tune their position Right. By the way, we refer Hiroshige with nickname Ikki Sae is standing at the position where Ikki stood Indeed Because he changed positions You were rushed over there I stood there first Huh? What happened? Probably, because I was there first Ikki changed places, right? Sae, you stood there first? Yes Oh But... right Uh uh The wind direction changed immediately Sae Yes Can we just take that Ikki changed position? Why? Because we have been talking for so long But I stood there first before... Sae, you don't have to defend him But probably because I stood there first... Well What we need now is not the truth But to criticize him. Criticize? Usually, Ikki will push troublesome things to you, right? Indeed This time, I think Ikki changed positions first. Alright Then we can complain about him together Alright Got it Ikki changed position first. Okay By the way, he never washes his coffee cup Yes! Yes! He puts aside every time He hasn't changed the ink cartridge of the copier Yes! Never saw him change When we criticize him so much, everyone feels it's too much But we also held back for a long time. Ikki is not Hiroshige's first name Why do we call him Ikki? Because the traffic lights are mentioned in the news Pedestrian bridge, dam, pyramid, etc. When facilities and objects cannot be moved by one person All use "Ikki" and "Nikki" Counted in such units Inspired by this We call him "Ikki" who does nothing He tells me how troublesome his previous job was Yes He would say, "There was no system before, everything was done by hand" And said sourly, "You are so blessed" Yes I'm not happy with you It's too much trouble to have you Too annoying Ikki's work efficiency is really low Very slow Slow and inaccurate Slow... These big three things The first one is the same as the third one I mean he is really too slow Yes Anyway Everyone was more poisonous on Monday than usual Surely, this day should be a holiday slow and inaccurate Dull and disgusting Smelly Very smelly Really smelly Very old fashioned Clothes are old fashioned Is he annoying? He's annoying The glasses don't suit him Don't suit him. I hate him showing his gums when he smiles Closes at 3pm Our work is now on the subject Everyone starts to check out If there is a 1 yen difference That's the big problem The amount is correct Thanks Work ended smoothly at 5:10 pm Do you know that there is a new Italian restaurant in front of the station? Where? After everyone lazing in the locker room... Underground It has been renovating over there, right? Yes yes Is the renovation finished? I went to the mall with Maki and Sae on the way after work I went to the cosmetics store and took a look at the foundation Actually, I have a product that I have been looking at before I asked Ms. Saleslady Sorry Yes I want to try this one This one, right? I'll try it for you, please sit there OK If the makeup looks good I will just buy and replace the foundation I am using now with this one But I don’t think it's right when I get on my face I'm sure I won't buy it I'm sorry to say it I'm making Ms. Saleslady... ..give me a try on foundation that I don’t plan to buy at all I always feel very sorry Although this foundation is loose powder, it can moisturize Oh yeah But I won't buy Layers of makeup are very light Oh yeah But I won't buy The problem is after.. I've tried it all over my face It's really hard to say not to buy But even so I don't want to buy inappropriate things How do you feel? Really not bad First praise I want to see when I take off my makeup Can you give me a sample to try today? Yes, of course. I'm sorry I want to think about it Thank you Go home with a sample that you can't use Do you want this sample? No I don't want too. Ms. Saleslady, I'm so sorry. Get home at 9:12pm I am back It's bad. I forgot to turn off aircon in the morning and went out But when I get home, it feels warm I'm a little happy A little fortunate for my own fault This is the happiest moment of the whole day today That's monday November 27, Wednesday I feel less blue in the morning of "no zan" "No zan" means no overtime (no zankyou) Feel a bit cold Isn't the heater off? Yeah What It's obviously on The locker room heater malfunctioned It’s a matter of life for us Tension in the locker room Can't it be switched on? Not at all Ah This is freezing to death Sae Really sorry It doesn't matter which one is unplugged But the heater cannot be unplugged I thought it would be fine for a while The heater can’t be pulled out The heater is not broken Really scared me Can Maki's switch be pulled out? No, wait for lunch break. My phone has only 6% battery left Why? There... the socket over there Why only 6% in the morning? Yes, charge it at home I plan to charge before bed I fell asleep right away Who cares about you? Hey What did you unplug just now? Oops Please, that is my shoulder massager. But you are not using now, right? I need to use it during lunch break, so I’m charging now Can’t you charge during lunch break? Don’t you need to recharge during lunch break? But I only have 6% battery left Mine is 0% Ask Maki to let you But I only have 10% battery I only have 6% In the locker room, there are often socket disputes. You do rock paper scissor I charged it first Okay, let's do it Rock Scissors... Okay, don't make noise Look at me Could it be... Extension board How could there be? Did you buy it? This was originally in the reception room Because no one has ever used it I asked the branch manager yesterday Can you bring it to the women's changing room? He agreed There is also this method I didn't expect it at all Everyone has been fighting for sockets It's okay with this, right? Everyone the storm has passed So there will be no ugly disputes A dispute that lasted for many years The end is drawn by Lord Komine. Lord Komine brings light to the dark dressing room I just took an extension Do not do that I will try it YesI'll plug it in And my Switch I plugged in Too exaggerated Everyone will use it at home, right? It's a bit wasteful to be empty here Yes Is there anything else to charge? I have a me too Are you ancient people? Amazing We use proper extension boards elsewhere but It feels like using a new type of machine here Great Impressive Yes Komine Komine I'm going to work Komine Komine Komine Okay Let's work! That's it Thanks to Lord Komine's concern Our dressing room has become more comfortable It’s great, I have all the charging Welcome Customer with number 14 Thank you Thank you Today's meal It'll definitely be curry since it's at the end of the month This is a tradition Since the bank is busy at the end of the month... we have to eat fast food. So they chose curry Koyama ate peanut senbei in the pantry before, right? The specialty of the branch Yes yes Then Koyama suddenly exclaimed and covered her mouth I thought something happened It turned out that her front teeth were knocked off Knocked off during eating senbei And because she can't go back She put the broken tooth in the purse first Anyway, she put it away first and went to work in the afternoon with a broken front tooth That's why Koyama covers her mouth when she speaks Yep She's covering her mouth Just like the pitcher and the receiver talking in a baseball game Listen When I saw her today Her front teeth are as good as ever Great She should've gone to the dentist no She didn't go to the dentist She glued it back at home last night Is this okay? I don't know. Like plastic models? Can the glue actually stick? Not clear but it seems ok But she was very careful when eating She's worried Of course she has to go to the dentist Yes this is only an emergency fix Koyama is really interesting She still has glue Koyama is a parttime in charge of the lobby Welcome Although it's a bit strange, she's not inviting What do you come for today? Oh yeah... How about Sasaki? I haven't spoken to him I spoke to him occasionally I feel like a good person who speaks kindly He feels very gentle. Sasaki is the new deputy chief who recently joined the branch He's pretty young In his 30s Is he? He feels older. Yes He feels like in his 40s His work ability is pretty good Average appearance and personality There is nothing brilliant We can't talk about this topic Maki is still willing to talk about this topic The part under the eyes looks like my uncle Just this sentence The new deputy chief has to work hard How do you say it starts when you make buttons? No overtime today Work ended quite early Good job. Do you want to eat something together? Okay go go go What to eat? What are we eating? I want to eat curry Didn’t you just eat at noon? Yes Curry is the last thing I want Yes Do you want to go to the Italian restaurant at the station? The new one? Yes yes How about there? How is the atmosphere? Atmosphere feels very good Where is it? It's the new Italian restaurant in front of the station Is that so? How? We need to take a gamble though Will we try a new store? Yes Then we'll Then let's go over there So, after getting off work Everyone went to the Italian restaurant in front of the station Beautiful So cute Yeah That's amazing Yes Capricciosa pizza? Okay Add two baguettes This traditional Roma ham bacon white sauce pasta Traditional Roma ham bacon What else? Order these first Ok Then, these first Ok Please For people like us who don’t want to waste a meal in a lifetime Going to a restaurant you’ve never been to for dinner is a gamble I clip too much Sorry Yummy You found the right store Passed It’s said that the chef who went to Southern Italy to practise He's very good at cooking He successfully opened a new store Will definitely visit again in the future Yummy It feels great So delicious Listen Sponge in the pantry sink Occasionally, there will be foam since the last person has not cleaned Someone left it there without washing it up exactly That's really annoying I obviously posted a notice on the side before "Rinse the sponge well after using" You posted, right? Everyone will clean up after seeing the notice Indeed I see residual foam less frequently But occasionally There is someone who can't clean it well Sakaki posted a notice and they still not clean it This one is really courageous Indeed I don't know who did it If you want to catch people, you can only catch redhanded Yes There is no evidence after all I think someone will be caught someday Maybe some male colleague? May be Isn't it Ikki? But he doesn't even wash? Right? Who would it be? Who is it? If you see anyone washing things there Just go over and take a look Just take a sneak peek Take a glance How to look So today The search headquarters of the pantry sponge foam serial case was established Too difficult Do you want us to take a video? How about installing a camera? Take a video Video Yes Then we can arrest him That's too difficult What did you say about the pizza in that store today? It’s not that I keep saying I want to eat pizza Never said before The train going home is also very empty There are many empty seats to sit down Work ended early today The trial of new stores is also very successful The train is also very empty A great day without waste 97 points over 100 3 points deducted are for bath time I took shower gel by mistake to wash my hair December 10, Wednesday Every year at the end of the year We're about to start giving customers the calendar sets in plastic bags When you roll the calendar, you will think This year is almost over But this project is unexpectedly difficult If it fails, the calendar get spoiled Everyone spoiled three sheets on average in the first year But Sae will break about three sheets even now Did you see the front teeth of Koyama? I didn't see. What happened? It seems that the viscosity of the glue has weakened Her front teeth were obviously longer this morning It fell off? Yes but Glue should not be used to glue the front teeth She should go to dentist quickly Yes By the way, it happens that there is glue in my bag I gave it to Koyama just now Is that so? Is she happy? Very happy She said "I was just planning to buy it" No She should see the dentist Why are you still going to buy glue? I don't think she'll go to the dentist Glue is no longer an emergency treatment Yes Eh...Kaori Did you put glue in your bag? Yes Is it weird? It's not strange, right? It’s rare to see people carrying glue in their bags Have you used? It's almost useless Exactly Just in case What in case? Such as this time Is it? Indeed, this is just in case Just in case Right By the way Sakaki has superb technique for rolling calendars She can almost enter the career of rolling calendars By the way, listen I went to the pantry before Did you spot the culprit? It’s not about the sponge case No? Let me continue.. I planned to make tea But there is not much water in the kettle I poured a pot and boiled it again Someone forgot to refill the kettle, right? Sometimes there are people who don’t fill water That's okay After all, it’s not completely out of water Right? But the problem is after that I went back to the locker room once When the water will boil in another minute I went back to the pantry Saw J J appeared It's totally a bad feeling J refers to the deputy branch manager He happens to be making coffee with water that hasn't boiled yet I said the water hasn't boiled yet He said it's okay, I like warm Made coffee directly Obviously the water is not boiling What's up? Don't understand him And do you know what he did later? What did he do? He used so much water by himself Wow wow wow wow Disgusting Right? And do you know what he said when he left? What did he say? Did he apologize? Should be? He said the coffee is almost gone. Go talk to the general affairs office. What the hell! It's so annoying Right? Terrible Can't stand it I'm so angry It's really... Even Sakaki's mood was disturbed by this incident The calendar that has always been perfectly rolled... Really annoying Are you OK? No She spoiled many copies The locker room is full of spoiled calendars What happened? Is it Sae again? I only broke one So rare What about the others? It's not who broke it... Blame J Did J roll calendars? It's not that J rolled. Right, Sakaki Um it's all his fault What happened? Let me explain What happened? That was during the lunch break today And J told her that the coffee is almost gone Go talk to the general affairs office Too much Thus Deputy branch manager J is hated by our female staff again Then... I'll avenge you next time Don't be upset Yes Okay? Yes Forget it Stop getting angry. It hurts Don't make it too hard By the way There is actually no J in the name of deputy branch manager J simply means he gets in the way (Jama dakara) Doesn't mean anything other than this So cold So cold On the way to the station after work that day... Hello Hello Deputy branch manager nickname J Where are you going? Going home Let's go together To the station? Yes yes I'm tired today, I planned to go home directly As a result, I, Komine and Maki were caught by J Taken to the ramen shop near the company It's fine today since it's a rare treat from him But still I don't want to go After we looked at the menu, J said... Everyone is going to challenge the Jumbo ramen No Absolutely not Is it? This amount should be eaten easily I can't finish How do you think we can eat? Right There is a woman who doesn't like her boss to make a boring joke She ends it easily with a joke Let me challenge you Our Lord Komine Sorry Coming I want to order Jumbo ramen Is it Jumbo ramen? Yes Ok that... I want soy sauce ramen with egg. Okay I want shio ramen. Okay I want regular ramen Ok All ordered Are you really challenging? I don't know If you don't dare, forget it I want to try Ok He just came to our branch for more than a year So he underestimated the woman Komine Tomoko Food is here. Amazing The Jumbo Ramen is bigger than expected Then.. Excuse me, can I take a picture first? Free if you can eat within 20 minutes If you fail, you have to pay 5000 yen for the huge ramen. It's amazing Amazing Is that OK? Can you eat this much? I do not know either But it looks delicious. Fighting I'll try my best I will start. Chopsticks chopsticks Thank you Then let's start Ready, go I started. Yummy Is it delicious? Delicious 5 minutes later The speed is unexpectedly good Are you alright? Yeah okay Don't force yourself Ok Do you want to drink water? No need 10 minutes later It's going well It feels like she can really finish it That's amazing. She will be able to finish. Yes Very good speed Fighting 3 minutes left Only a little left This should really work out 3 minutes left Because he has to pay J is very active Good, only a bit left No way, I give up I can't eat anymore. Do you want to work harder? No more Only the last bite left Stomach is too full. There is still time, you can't? Sorry I can't eat Too full then... Are you going to the previous one? There is the only a little bit left. It's really the limit Is it? Only a little left Time's up So the deputy branch manager paid a total of 7,400 yen Thank you Then let's go What a pity There are only two spoonful left I did it on purpose I can actually eat But you can get it free I deliberately didn't finish it Is that so? I can easily finish that amount Is it true? But if it succeeds, it will only be good for J, right? Besides, for Sakaki I just want to deliberately not finish it It's a strategy I planned it from the beginning J still wants to coax you to continue eating at the end He doesn't want to pay, so he fights hard When you say you can't eat His expression is so funny Isn't it cool Very cool Great We immediately post Lord Komine’s revenge drama to the group chat In the locker room the next morning... Komine Komine Komine Komine Komine Full of cheers to Komine Komine Komine December 11, Wednesday Today is the day of routine robbery prevention training every year Around 4pm after closing Police officers posing as robbers will come in Everyone is doing their work restlessly from 3:30 pm The person who was appointed to act as a hostage client during the morning meeting Will wait in the lobby for the robbers This year is Kaori Robbers appear at 4:05pm The same person plays the robber every year The familiar police officer, Saeki The basic process is the same every year Hello Yes I need money To withdraw money, please go to the counters I won't go What? Hey It has started Hey, hand over the money Some were scared by police officer Saeki’s realistic acting skills Last year, Sae played the role of the client Hand over the money Hey Rest assured I won't hurt you She cried so badly that she attracted the attention of robber Faster The year before last was Maki Hey You all be quiet Hey What's so funny? Sorry She couldn't help laughing and was scolded Hey, hand in the money quickly Hand over the money Hand over the money soon Don't you care about her life? Once the robber asks for money It's up to the section manager to deal with You are not allowed to move Sir, please calm down Shut up, hand over the money Understood We will be ready to please give us some time Hand it in quickly Hand over as much as possible Since security is the priority We will give the money It’s just that we only buy time Please leave with this money Not enough Not enough, give it all over Faster Don't you care about her life? Don't move You are not allowed to move Stay where you are Okay Don't move After the robber took the money and left... The person responsible for tracking will also follow Good It's finished. Everyone worked hard End of training Then please come to the lobby to gather Afterwards, everyone will gather in the lobby Kaori is amazing The process of giving cash to the robbers should take a little longer... Feedback time Thank you Then there are two people in charge of tracking Note that the culprit is armed Officer Saeki has always been dressed like this I feel a little funny every time I see it We review today’s training in the locker room after the end I feel quite mild this year Yeah I don't feel any tension Indeed That's because Sae cried last year, right? For this reason I'm really afraid of these robbers Everyone is afraid of robbers The key is training By the way, the police officer worried too much this year I do feel that the drama is not enough I told him before he started to let me go Is it? He didn't let go It looks fake. Yes yes In this way, we can't get immersed in the situation either Yes yes Seriously I think I can defeat this robber It's over if it doesn't work Everyone is critical of Officer Saeki’s acting skills Officer Saeki learned his acting skills from TV dramas, right? Yes yes we can feel "Where did he watch this?" Sometimes it feels lifeless Seen it before. He should have driven people to desperation The sense of oppression Yes He played it just like that. It's not right. Police Officer Saeki should hand over this role to a young man, right? Right yeah It's almost time for a replacement but Give him another chance next year Can it work? I think he has potential I don’t know who trained whom He should be more energetic Today's work ends earlier than expected I went to the gym with Maki and Sae I haven't gone for 3 and a half months Sae's longer than that Both of us are afraid of the scale Aren't you coming? I haven't practiced for a long time.. ..so we get on a bike and practice for an hour And Maki who insists on coming to the gym seriously... is not at the same level as us. I feel Maki is so far away from us I miss the time when we were cycling together It's lonely But there is no way but Even if she uses different fitness equipment Maki is Maki Yes Maki who is with us She' still the same as before We want to be a place where she can return We think that way. December 15, Sunday Today is a rest day I woke up at around 11 without an alarm Wash my face, change my clothes and put on makeup Clean the room a bit With the high school classmates Rie and Kumi who are from my hometown and working we talk at a coffee shop having lunch Listen The sponge in our company's pantry Someone will leave it without washing it up I know that well There are people in our company who don’t clean up That's really unpleasant My dad often does this Is that the same for Koji? Um, I am often scolded by Mieko for this I feel Mieko must be very angry She is very careful Yes With them, we talk about each other's company and home She worries about her body, right? Yes. Yes Moreover Our senior posted a note Please rinse the sponge after using Senior's words Is it the senior Komine you mentioned before? It’s not Komine, but Sakaki That serious senior yes yes But occasionally someone still doesn’t rinse the sponge Really stubborn It’s hard to correct when you’re used to it right Everyone wants to catch the culprit So we all started monitoring that area Big search project. Yes Did you find? No We can't find why Because the culprit is me No way Why? The plot is surprising, right? The culprit is here I'm not sure I did it myself But at home, my mother often reminds me So it's possible that I just put it in the pantry that's terrible Of course, I will clean it now Sure enough, there is no such phenomenon now It should be me Don't you tell them? I can't say it now I can't say it What to do then? Let it be. I'll just be careful. A dead end. Yes What is it? Sorry, can you pour us some water? Thanks Oh Completely unrelated topic but... Natchan is married Which Natchan? Sakazaki Natchan Is it the one that hot girl? Yes, yes That Natchan When? This summer Natchan and I are classmates in high school Because in different groups So I don’t remember if we talked With whom? Should be a senior in the company Is that so? Then listen to the question Here comes the Rie's quiz Why did I know Natchan got married? Why? Please think Why did you know? I haven't met Natchan and know her contact after graduating from high school Why did I know she got married? Why? It's Natchan, right?Yeah It's Natchan Can't think of it at all Any hint? Hint? I can't really guess. Hint Um miracle miracle? miracle Obvious hint please! miracle? It's obvious I gave you a clear hint miracle? Yes Do you know her husband? Wrong, bigger miracle Bigger You will be surprised. You will be surprised? You will scream "super miracle" Like.. You chase the butterfly and ran into Natchan's wedding Why would I chase a butterfly? I feel you will chase Not really What is it? Um, let me give up and tell us Can't guess can't guess The correct answer is When I travelled to Hawaii I ran into Natchan who had a wedding there A coincidence What a coincidence In Hawaii? In Hawaii accidental? accidental When I was walking near the church Heard someone call me Looking back, I saw Natchan in her wedding dress Super miracle What a miracle It's pretty miraculous Right? What happened? Does this miracle matter? Then Rie went out with the manager of this shop due to the meaningless coincidence that he has the same first name and last name with her father The weekends of three of us ended. The probability is very low Very low December 16, Monday The toilet ring in our bank is very cold in winter It's so cold that it feels like it's been frozen The toilet in winter is really the same as the penalty You have to be mentally prepared before sitting down Yes Listen Do you sit down?

Yes I really think it’s not easy for everyone Just ban this activity exactly Don’t say this and pretend to be considerate of our difficulties And are you upset? His reaction when giving Ikki When he says thank you yes yes And put on a handsome face Say "thank you" like this Yep What the hell is this? I'm so angry Don't put on the look of an admired senior Yeah, we don't admire He watched too much TV series, right? The dramas he watched are too old Chocolate is sweet The comments on the people who accepted it are very spicy He is too narcissistic March 7, Saturday Get up around 11am today Clean the room Practice abs while watching TV Dinner with Rie and Kumi Listening to Kumi pretending to complain about her boyfriend Speaking of him.. It's not me but... Yeah But he sends me many messages a day And will report in detail what he did in a day How detailed? For example, I had Chinese food for lunch Highway is jammed. He sends me messages about these things The traffic jam is too detailed I don't know how to reply to these messages But I would seem ignoring him if I don’t reply.. So I reply What are you replying? "Is that so?" There should be a better reply But he said that the highway is jammed. What should I reply? You can reply like... "It would be good if it doesn't jam" What is that? Or recommend him to another highway Expand the topic Doesn't that mean I gave up You can still reply like.. "Be careful on the road" Good correct answer Very troublesome This is a good reply But your boyfriend is good Right? Much better than not sending a message So it's fine. I understand Then break up I won't break up Go home and take a bath and apply a mask Practice my abs while watching TV sleep after that. At least that was the original plan yesterday. But I didn’t get up until noon Lying at home all day afterwards Of course I didn’t clean or train my abs I didn't go to see Rie and the others I didn't do any of the original plan It means that the plan of the day is to lie down all day Tomorrow will definitely come as planned April 1, Wednesday Starting today So Yeon, a Korean, joins the branch Please take care of me Please take care of us Number 7 Do you want to transfer? Let me use your passbook Please sit and wait Her Japanese is very good Also very serious and a good girl Ranma Half...half Ranma 1/2? I like it very much Really? So Yeon seems to like Japanese anime/manga Soon she gets along with Sae Really? If you like Ranma You will definitely like "Inuyasha" by the same author I want to read it Really? Then I will bring you the complete works tomorrow Thank you I'm so happy The Complete Works of Inuyasha Do you know Inuyasha? Inuyasha is a demon It's a mixture of monster and human Mixed blood Just in case I secretly searched Kagome is a modern girl She saw him through time and space Inuyasha- 56 volumes Kagome is the reincarnation of Kikyo I hope So Yeon won't come to hate Japan To hold a welcome party for So Yeon after work.. Everyone went to karaoke Dance Too long So Yeon, do you know this song? Yes, Evangelion You know It seems that Korea often airs Japanese programs So So Yeon knows a lot of Japanese songs This.. She has always been like this Sakaki Sakaki is great Who's next? (Next song "Will" Nakajima Mikashi) Who's going to sing Do you know Nakashima Mikashi? Yes, I know She is also very famous in Korea This is my first time singing So Yeon sings really well Everyone is fascinated by her singing but When So Yeon sang The man in the video was one year senior of me in middle school The handsome senior who has a fan club and super popular I don’t know if it’s a costume or own clothes I don’t know if it’s acting or true feelings It's really special That's more impressive than So Yeon's singing April 10, Friday The blues increases by 30% on rainy days Standing close to a wet middle-aged man is hell. It's raining The umbrella is still so wet All wet Listen Mobile phones have evolved so much Why did the umbrella stop evolving? It might still be like this in 100 years possible Maybe even the car can fly into the sky but the umbrella will still be like this then Future OL (Office Ladies) will complain like us exactly Complaining that the umbrella is still the same All OLs in the company with wet clothes Future OL The uniform might be silver I don't know Shouldn't it be white? That's the one How the people look like in Star Wars Yes yes that way The kind that wraps up the whole body And wearing a helmet That's great Then you can leave without makeup Right We can get up later awesome Talking about the future OL The work should be all automatic, right? It should be automatic. Reception of customers and calculations are done by robots We only need to start the computer when we come to the company in the morning Cool I can go home before noon, right? right You can finish work in 10 seconds, right? Oh Future OL is great Right? That should not be an OL anymore But the umbrella still looks like this Only umbrellas Only umbrellas Good morning Sae surpassed the OLs with wet clothes Sae, you are soaked. She becomes a drenched OL. Don't you hold an umbrella? Yes Then why? I forgot to bring an umbrella That's terrible How come you forgot to bring it in the rain? Can I put my clothes over there? So cold Today happens to be Gotoubi (5th, 10th, 15th etc...many companies make payments on these days) Many people come to the branch. It's very busy I will handle the formalities for you Please take the number plate and sit at the back for a while Please confirm Welcome Welcome Really tired Today is Gotoubi. Can Gotoubi disappear from this world? Really? Listen Auntie in the cafeteria has changed from today The new auntie's name is Arai For us Canteen food tasting good or bad... ..affects our motivation for work in the afternoon. That is It’s not an exaggeration to say that it's tied to the branch’s performance This aunt Arai’s debut... Fried mackerel set meal Debuting with fried food I can tell that Aunt Arai is very serious The first mackerel Pour the sauce to taste I'm gonna start now Crispy skin and tender fish Then the second one is topped with soy sauce and mayonnaise to taste I see. Aunt Arai’s debut fried mackerel set meal Its taste... very ordinary, right? Yes Quality of frying Softness of fish Rice Crispiness of cabbage All as expected Couldn't be more ordinary This taste is definitely not bad Very close to homestyle taste I really hope she can maintain this quality Looking forward to Arai's performance in the future So tired So tired By the way, it was cold in the branch today Very cold Super cold I think so too Someone lowered the temp of aircon, right? It is possible. Who is it? J is afraid of heat Is he the culprit? Definitely him But it may not be him No It must be J Definitely J It's not certain yet He is really selfish Do you think this is his home? Maybe it's not him Sae You agree with our statement What? We have all started complaining that J did it Don't refute But maybe not Sae Now is not the time to fight about this It's not the time to fight about this? Yes What we need now is not the truth But to criticize Criticize? Yes If J is the culprit We can talk bad things as much as we want I definitely hope that the culprit is J Yes I think it's J doing it Say bad things to make you feel comfortable Yes, you can feel comfortable Yes Maybe it really is him Yes Is he really afraid of heat? I think so. The motivation is sufficient Yes It's basically him What is he doing? Why don't you care about the temperature in the branch? Really It's almost freezing to death Hello it's too cold Hello What happened to you guys? Today... J turned down the temperature of the air-con What's going on? Isn't it cold in the branch today? It's really cold That was because J was afraid of heat and turned down the temperature of the air-con He did right? Not him... What? It's not him? There was a hole in the original air-con duct. Yesterday, Hayasaka from general affairs came to fix the hole Really? Yes This way everyone in the branch can be air-conditioned It feel so cold is that true? Yes Didn't J fix the duct? It's not him, it's Hayasaka Is it? Hayasaka reported to me in the morning "The hole in the duct is fixed" That's it J is innocent So it’s not cold but it's restored to the original temp But it's really cold Yes Hayasaka repaired the duct for the bank And he is a good person different from J So I won't speak ill of him We lost the target Hello Hello It's really cold today It's cold It seems that Hayasaka fixed the duct Yeah Yesterday J told Hayasaka to let him fix the duct What? Did J say it? Yes Is it an instruction from J? It’s not that the instructions.. it's just what J told Hayasaka Sorry This is definitely not a mistake, right? What's wrong? The object of criticism is resurrected Great What happened? Great After work Maki, Sae and I went to the gym But what we do together is only stretching Things afterwards are different Don't know when does it starts but Maki and other regulars got familiar It can be done Yes Do you want to add some weight?

Yes, I'm going to practice. yes yes See you later See you later Bye We didn’t even know that she was called "Little Maki" April 16, Thursday Good morning Good morning Good morning So Yeon's bag is so cute. Where did you buy it? So Yeon has been in the company for two weeks. She has a cheerful personality Get along with everyone very quickly But there is one thing I care about That's how So Yeon opened the locker She will open the door slightly wider When changing clothes that my place is narrower She should be harmless But every day is a little stressful But I don’t want to point out that I’m narrow-minded Although I'm the only one In case it makes her feel that all Japanese are narrow-minded It will become an international problem So Yeon is very nice I don't want her to leave a bad impression on the Japanese I'll bear it for Japan Super handsome Did you read? Have you read it? Not yet You are here. Hello Hello This is for you I bought a new one If you like it, use this May I? Yes Thank you You're welcome. I'm leaving. I want to talk about why Onodera gave me the seal case This goes back to a few months ago The seal is a necessity for our bank staff Whatever the seal box will do but Everyone will use character cases Or a very beautiful case This is mine This is Maki's This is Sae's This is Lord Komine's This is Sakaki's For everyone to taste a bit of happiness in tough work someone made a heartbreaking effort And chief Onodera used this She is very capable But the seal case is too ugly What's wrong with this? Seal case I don't know what to say. Anyway... So cute Really? Thank you Isn't it cute? Cute This casual remark became an opportunity To be honest, this is so weird I don't want to use it But you can't waste the kindness of Onodera It's horrible to make her angry Welcome What is that? The seal case given by Onodera So close She must have almost talked bad about it just now Chief Onodera will be miserable if she said This is the seal case given by Onodera To prevent everyone from saying "ugly" without knowing it I'll introduce it first Maki This is the seal case given by Onodera Sae This is the seal case given by Onodera Yes Of course, I also emphasized that this is not my taste So Yeon This is the seal case given by Onodera From chief Onodera Kaori Yes This is the seal case given by Onodera Is that so? So cute really? Yes Super cute She feels cute Thank you Today, the branch is less crowded and relatively idle In the end, still don’t know who is the culprit in the sponge case? Can't catch.. From my observation, everyone becomes very clean I watched the male staff while washing They all cleaned I also observed that everyone cleaned up It hasn’t happened since then Isn't that all right? It should be that the note is working Maybe Yes..yes What happened? J followed my Instagram Eh Did he open Instagram? Yes Just look at it With fake name This is the account called Naokix Really, he opened Instagram Why Naokix? Isn't his name Naoki? Naokix is ​​so stupid What did Naokix post on Instagram? It seems to be a good food Didn't he follow you? No I locked it Is it? It's better to lock it God knows who will see your Instagram Yes But even you only lock it now You can't escape Naokix's follow You follow back I don't want it Found terrible photos What?å Look at this.. Selfie So scary ...so scary Naokix takes a selfie in the mirror in the beauty salon It's so funny Does he consider himself a model? Sae.. like it No..I don't want Don't don't I don't want Don't don't Don't like Listen Do you know that Naokix opened Instagram? I don't know So surprising Then I noticed one thing Hey Sakaki You mentioned Instagram in full Seems so Right I mean Instagram Really meticulous Sancha, Matsukiyo too..right? Another meticulous case Sakaki doesn't call MatsuKiyo but Matsumoto Kiyoshi (drugstore name) She doesn't say Sancha, but Sangenjaya Someone who can't say abbreviations But every time you say the full name of Instagram Don't you find it troublesome? No I'm used to it Are you used to Instagram? because I always talk about Instagram Hard to say abbreviation Everyone normally says abbreviations Ah very common I think Instagram will do Here comes the humility of the mystery Do you feel embarrassed to say as Insta? Not embarrassed But if I say suddenly It'll be a little overwhelmed It's nothing like that Everyone says Insta Yes How would you say "suitable for insta" I would never say this Something to say Just say it is suitable for posting on Instagram It's more stubborn than humble Try saying Insta Don't talk about this anymore Just once Try once Everyone will say it together Let's say together We don't let you say it alone I just say Instagram Let's say together 123 Insta A few minutes later Sakaki overcomes the embarrassment Successfully debuted to say Insta Amazing Great Really?
