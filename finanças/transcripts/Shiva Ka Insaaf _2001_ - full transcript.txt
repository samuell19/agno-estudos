Catch her. - where"s that girl? - what will we tell Mr.Dabholkar? - Let"s look there. - Let"s go. The girl has escaped. How are we to face Dabholkar now? Let"s go. - Babholkar here. - lnspector Khan speaking. Did my men kidnap that club dancer? wouldn"t it be foolish to expect those cowards... ... to accomplish things which require courage? - what nonsense? - The girl has escaped. At present your men are trembling with fear... ... and are searching for a place to hide. You know very well that l feel restless... ... if l don"t find a new girl everyday to romance. what"s the matter, Khan? why are you silent? l"ll call you later. wait for my call. Call me back soon. what"s the matter? why are you roaming around... ... alone in this obscure dark night? l"m not roaming around. l just came from Nasik. l"m getting late. Excuse Me. l need to call my mother. Do you really want to call your mother or is it that you... ... want to make an appointment for the night with a rich man? lnspector, not everyone is like that. l have no other choice but to be here at this moment. And l have no other choice but to be suspicious about you. Officers like you who fail to learn from the experiences... ... of life begin to suspect others. Just like those ignorant people... ... who only know to suspect. l"ve had enough experiences in my life. Come with me to the Police Station. And if in case my ... ... suspicion turns out to be true,then you won"t be spared. - Police station! why not? - Get in. what"s your name? what do you do? You"ll be shocked to hear that. Oh really? Then l"ll scare you to death. You speak too much. lf l get a single evidence against you... ... l can create a big issue over it. l"ll lock you up in the cell the whole night... ... and thrash you up beyond recognition. l can even ruin your life. All this seems to be stolen goods. You were out to ruin my life! You wanted to teach me a lesson! Now what do you have to say? l"m lnspector Kiran and l"ll be your senior here. l"ll take legal action against you. l"ll file a report against you in which... ... l"ll mention that you are a corrupt officer... ...and bring to fore all those repulsive secrets about you! Please don"t do that. l have a family to look after. l promise l won"t do this again. Please forgive me. That"s impossible. l"ll retire day after tomorrow. lf you take a legal action against me... ... then l won"t be able to face others. Please forgive me. Okay. l"ll forgive you. But l need your signature on this Blank paper. Signatures? So that henceforth if you do any such thing... ... this paper will be of great use for me. But... You better sign if you care for your reputation. Okay... l"ll sign. Come on ... sign it. Mother... My dearest mother! - what took you so long? - lt was already late by the time... ... l reached here. Then l had to go to the police station too. l thought that l should come to meet you in my uniform. Good you did that. You look impressive in this uniform. Today is the death anniversary of your father and your sister. Mother, how can l ever forget that? l lost my father and my elder sister on this very day. And l wonder where my younger sister is. This tragic incident in my life inspired me to take up... ... this profession so that l could avenge their death. Child, you"ve done just the right thing. You"ve taken initial step towards your goal... ... but don"t waver from your path. Madam is here The very same girl who dares to dream @ achieve those dreams! lt"s this attitude of yours that has made you lnspector Kiran. l have not yet achieved my goal, lnspector. - what do you mean? - l want to reopen the file... ... of the murder and rape which took place 12 years ago. - why? - Because the accused managed to escape... ... by taking advantage of the shortcomings of our law. which case are you referring to? Sir, this incident took place twelve years ago. On 15th October 1999, they looted the National Herald Bank. That lnspector won"t be able to arrest us. Don"t move. Otherwise l"ll shoot! You are under arrest. You seem to be very happy to have us in your custody. You seem to have forgotten how dangerous we are. You won"t be able to save yourself from our wrath. You mean nothing to me. You are a stigma on this society... ... and l want to put an end to reign of terror. l"ll see to it that you are taken to the gallows. lnspector, we looted Rs.25lakhs from the bank. You can keep 5 lakhs and give the rest to us. - Do you agree? - l can earn millions if l want. But l don"t intend to do so. l derive greater happiness from punishing criminals like you. But what will you gain by punishing us? Just an insignificant medal which has no value at all. The medal means much more... ... than riches to me. - Oh well! - lnspector, you"ll have to bear the consequences. l"ll ruin your life. You are in my custody now. l"ll make your life miserable. lnspector Bakshi, keep an eye on them. You don"t know what you are doing. You are inviting your own doom, what do you say? Don"t worry Sir. Sir, l assure you that l won"t... ... allow them to escape. Don"t worry, Sir, l"ll be here. l"ll call you later. And here"s your bubblegum. You"ll need it. lnspector, remember what you had said... ... that we"ll lead a miserable... ... life behind the bars, right? Now tell me... who"ll lead a miserable life? He wanted to put us behind the bars. He has been liberated forever. Catch that girl. wait... it"s my turn. Stop! Oh no... don"t shoot. Please don"t shoot. what an experience that was! Go there. Go soon. Hey no...not again! Please save me. Shall l come with you? Come in. - Let"s go Driver. - Yes Madam. what? lnspector Karma has been murdered? And even your daughter has been raped? But how did this happen? l won"t spare those who are guilty of this crime. Just tell me their names. l"ll shoot all of them under the pretext of an encounter. who killed him? They are same people who had looted the bank. He had arrested those criminals. Did they murder him? Yes, they are the very same people. l can see that you are rather shocked by this tragic incident. Perhaps that"s why you are blaming the wrong people. l"m not in a state of shock... l can recognise each one of them. Can you recognise them? - very well. - Okay. Constable. - Yes Sir. Bring Rana, Fazlu and Dabholkar here. what"s the matter, lnspector? what"s your problem? The mosquitoes feasted on us last night. we had just managed to sleep... but you woke us up. Are you sure they were the same people? Yes, l am sure. They are the same people who ruined my life. Sister in law, l think you are mistaken. Because they were in my custody last night. Then how can they commit the murder. l know everything lnspector. l know very well that the four of them... ... can do nothing without your help. Even you are with them. Any problem? - But where is she? - There she is, right in front of you. But remember, you too will die... ... a miserable death. Today l curse you... ... you will certainly die a miserable death. And in this manner they killed... ... the man who was true to his duty. Now they must be somewhere amassing riches... ...celebrating the defeat of law! How do you know all this? who are those people whom you are talking about? This is my own story, Sir. lnspector Karma was my father. And the girl who was raped was my elder sister. l wonder where my other sister is. My younger sister Sapna killed lnspector Bakshi. And she ran away after killing him. l wonder where she is now. This is my younger sister Sapna"s photograph. Mr.Dabholkar, listen to me. Stop scratching and get ready for a... ... romantic rendezvous with this girl. l can stop anything but not itching. By the way... if l have to scratch...l mean... ... if l have to meet this girl, where should l go? Not very far. Just a few steps away... ... she works as the bar dancer in that hotel. She"ll be performing today. l"ll fix your appointment with her soon after her performance. what are you waiting for? Go soon and do your work. Once the work is over, they drive you out. Her alluring beauty has made me restless. where are you, O my love? ""l"ve created a sensation in this town"" ""l"m a gorgeous beauty"" ""My alluring beauty..."" ""... has made my life difficult"" ""There are so many who desire to touch me..."" "" But mind you... it"s not that easy"" ""l"m so scared!"" ""There are so many who crave for me"" ""They beseech for a single moment of love"" ""There are so many who fall for me"" You"ve created a sensation in this town. You are a gorgeous beauty. Even my Boss has fallen for you. - what nonsense? - Take this, it"s 10000. - For what? - My boss wants to make you his own. That"s impossible...pass on that message to your boss. we know how to make things possible. Catch her. Leave that girl. Else l won"t spare you. we"ve seen many like you. And they landed in the hospital! Or at times we even killed them. Get lost is you care for your life. l"m not a coward like them. You cannot harm me. But l can certainly put an end to my enemies. - How"s that? - l"ll show you. Let me see how you escape from us. Hey you! Spoilt brat... how dare you do that? - Come to the police station. - Please listen to me. - l don"t want to hear anything. - But a girl... - Please listen to me. - l know you people well. You can be sentenced to one month imprisonment. Only then will people like you learn a lesson. Madam, it"s not without a reason that l behaved like that. l had a valid reason. Let"s see. - lnspector... - what"s it? what brings you here at this hour? why did you arrest him? what right do you have to ask me that? l just want to know are innocents punished too? So you think that he is innocent. He tried to save me from those goons. - And you arrested him? - You look like a bar dancer to me. You are talking about your honour? which is sold even before the show is over! You are a police officer... you earn a good salary too. You lead a luxurious life, so you fail to understand the poor. we are forced to do anything to earn a living. You have no right to comment on our life! Try to put an end to the malignancies of this society. Or else you"ll repent for life. You can"t suppress truth like that. You didn"t arrest the goons who tried to rape me... ... isn"t this injustice? And you arrested the person who saved me. l"m ready to give his bail. - Constable. - Yes Sir. - Leave that man. You were so brash. Those who lead a solitary life have to be like that. Are you all alone? A few moments ago, l was all alone... ... but now l have a well wisher. l wonder how long he will be with me. whom are you talking about? About you. Since l was separated from my parents... ... l"ve been struggling all alone. But today you fought for me. l felt as if l was not alone. And you fought with the lnspector. l felt as if l"ve met my long lost friend. l couldn"t control my anger when she abused me. Tell me something about yourself. - where are your parents? - l just remember that... ... l was separated from my parents when l was just a child. A club dancer helped me and l became one too. She died some years ago. l wonder where my parents are. why don"t you do one thing? You meet my father... He has got good contacts. l"m sure he"ll hell you to find your parents. So many years have passed by... how"s it possible? lt certainly isn"t:t impossible. You want to meet your parents, right? - Yes. - Then come with me. ls this your house? Yes... l stay here. Come on in. Come upstairs. Your work will be done. Don"t worry. Be at ease. Daddy, l want you to meet someone. - who"s she? - She"s Sapna. Daddy, she needs your help. But l think l need help at this moment. Bring her some other time. Okay, let"s go. Sorry for that. lt"s enough that l saw him. Fazlu... the blind man. My first victim would be lnspector Khan. Stop that nonsense, lnspector Kiran. Neither have l been a party to any of their evil exploits... ... nor have l taken any bribe from them. Since childhood l"ve been... ... searching for th five of you. l recognised you in the very first meeting. But l couldn"t take any action against you. But then l certainly scored a point over you. - what? - l had asked you sign a blank paper the other day. Now if you don"t listen to me... ... l can easily trap you in a criminal case... ... and make your life miserable. That would be illegal. Such words don"t suit you. So you better not give me such advises. Tell me, will you do as l say? - what do you want me to do? - Testify against them. Help me to arrest them. lnspector, take your decision soon. what"s the matter, Rana? why do you look so tense? we"ll be facing the consequences of our sins... ... which we committed 12 years ago. - what do you mean? The daughter of the lnspector whom we had killed ... ...12 years ago has taken charge of this area as the lnspector. She even interrogated Khan about us. She"s forcing him to testify against us. whoever she is, she"s just a girl! we"ll teach her a lesson. You should always beware of the police... ...lt will create a big problem if we harm even one of them. Then how are we to stop them? Only lnspector Khan can lead her to us. But what if"s not there to show the way? Dabholkar, do something. - Ram here.-Tell me. - l just saw a man going to Khan"s house. - He was incessantly scratching himself. - was he? wait there. l"ll be there in a moment. Khan is no more! Madam, he committed suicide. He has not committed suicide. He has been murdered. Had he committed suicide, it would have been evident. - Send the body for post mortem. - Okay Madam. who"s that? Hurry up, tell me. l can"t bear this itching. l"ll put an end to that problem of yours. Oh really? Then tell me the cure. The cure is your death. who"s speaking? A witness to your crime... ... a victim of your atrocities. l"m lnspector Karma"s daughter. l"ll torture the four of you to death. Oh really! But l care the least. You can do me no harm. l"ll continue to lead a luxurious life. Just look at your watch. Now it"s 8 pm. But exactly at 8:30 you"ll... ... come face to face with death. Your time starts now. Rana, Dabholkar here. Khan is no more. But just now a girl threatened to kill me. She introduced herself as lnspector Karma"s daughter. That means she is lnspector Karma"s daughter. You don"t worry. l"ll deal with her. But that he"ll do only in the morning. But she"ll be coming here now. what shall l do? l"ll have to do something. what shall l do? where shall l go? what a mess! l don"t even know that girl. Shall l leave this city? l just don"t understand. l think l should go from here. Hey... he looks like me. l think the drinks have got better of me. l feel as if l"m seeing my reflection but without a mirror. By any chance, are you my twin brother? l"m the King and you are the Pauper. Let"s switch roles. Take this car and my house keys... - Everything is yours. - l hope you are not joking. - Oh no. - Do you know driving? l was a driver for. But in an accident l killed 6 children... ... and my license was canceled. Then l became a beggar. Okay then, let"s exchange our clothes. lt"s been days since l last sat in a car. Your time starts now. That was a perfect timing. l have escaped death. l have deceived the lnspector"s daughter. Give me alms... Give me something for God"s sake. Take this. what"s this? Half a note? Even your life is like this note, Dabholkar. There"s just 5 minutes left for 8:30 pm. So, what will you do? will you shoot me? will you behead me? l know what"s to be done. A pinch of this itching powder... ... and no one can save you. Take this. You are repeating the same mistake... ... you committed that night. The possibility can"t be ruled out that you are attacked... ... then again he"ll try to save and then l"ll arrest him... ... and then you"ll argue with me to grant him a bail. Shun that sarcasm. Be more specific. Take my advice and stop roaming around in the night. Take it as an elder sister"s advice. Perhaps you are right. But you should that there has to be a reason for everything. There has to be some motive. what are you doing here at this hour? l have an important work to do. - what about you? - l have finished doing an important thing. what was that important work? Oh no... you are a police officer. l would have certainly told you, had you been my sister. So... even Dabholkar is no more! Till yesterday he was an infamous goon! But he"s lost to anonymity. - How"s that possible? - He was a bag of diseases. He was inflicted with all ... ... the possible diseases in this world. And finally the diseases got better of him. Oh no....he didn"t die of diseases... ... he has been killed. l"m sure lnspector Kiran is the mastermind behind this murder. Are you talking about lnspector Karma"s daughter? Dabholkar had called me just a few moments before his death. lnspector Karma"s daughter had threatened to kill him. And then she killed her. But the murder was made to look like a natural death. - what does she want? - Our death. She wants to take her revenge. She wants to avenge her father"s and sister"s death. But before that, we"ll kill her. The post mortem report says that ... ... Dabholkar was suffering from ltching disease. He scratched himself to death. But you say that he has been murdered? l think that the post mortem expert has been very negligent. Had the post mortem been done carefully... ... it would have been known that someone had... ... smeared itching powder on him. what? ltching powder? This is ridiculous. You are right, Sir. l"m sure his friends are behind this. l won"t spare them. Before that, think about arresting them. How will you arrest them without evidence? Do you even know where they are? How long can they remain in hiding, sir? And l know they are in China Town at this moment. ""One push from me"" ""And he reached Kolkata"" ""My beloved....l gave him a slight nudge"" ""And he reached Kolkata"" ""My heart skips a beat... when he looks at me"" ""l skip a beat... when he holds my hand"" ""He tries to lure me"" ""who will persuade him?"" ""l gave him such a push"" ""That he reached Kolkata"" ""He always tries to woo me."" ""His very look intoxicates me"" ""And then gradually he comes near me"" ""Passion overcomes me"" ""l"ve fallen for his charms"" ""Mischief in my eyes and desire in my heart"" ""This is the first time l"ve fallen for someone"" ""Oh... he"s so charming"" ""Oh... he"s so irresistible"" ""l was so much in love with him"" ""My beloved reached Kolkata"" lnspector Kiran, you"ve reached here finally! But now you won"t be able to escape now. - what do you say? - Catch her. Let me go. Let me go! Hand over that girl to us. Should l do that? what did you say? Do you want her now? Run! Thanks a lot... for saving me. l"m Police lnspector Kiran. You"ve done a great favour by saving my life. lf you ever need any help... ... don"t hesitate to come to me. l"ll certainly help you. How much you can help me is quite obvious! Had l not been here today, what would have happened? Thanks and take care. what"s this? why don"t you take something? lt"s all because of him. He was so strong. He gave us a nice thrashing. The girl was in our custody. But Shiwa came in between and he did this to us. He"s prowess is unparalleled. whom are you talking about? l"ll tell you. He"s Shiwa. He was released today. He was guilty of assassinating the Chief Minister. Shiwa... the name sounds familiar. Do you know him? There are many by that name in our Hitlist. l wonder who this one is, who wants to meet his doom. we"ll know that very soon. But before that we"ll have to put an end... - ... to our greatest enemy. - lnspector Kiran. Did you call me, Madam? Do one thing. Take these photographs. Send the copies to all the Police stations. Today"s the New Year Eve... it"s possible that... ... at least one of them is spotted somewhere. A killer is following them. - Sapna, just a moment. - Rajesh. - Rajesh... you? - Sapna, where are you going? l was searching for you. Everyone in this world is in search for something. Some reach their goal ... while some don"t. But why were you searching for me? You"ll feel the need for a friend at times. - what happened? - My daddy has been killed. l"m in search of his murderer. The day l find him... l won"t spare him. - what? - will you meet me again? - Not today, let"s meet tomorrow. - l"ll wait for you. - At the same place. - Okay. Excuse me, this is mine. lt"s pretty. Even you are very pretty. Beauty can be disastrous too. l wouldn"t mind if my doom is so beautiful! ""You won"t be able to hide from me"" ""No matter how much you try to deceive me"" ""l"ll certainly meet the person l"m searching for"" ""where are you... you gave me sleepless nights"" ""l"ve gone crazy about you"" ""How am l to find him"" ""l"m missing him so much"" ""The one whom l loved deeply"" ""l"m in search for that beloved of mine"" ""Now he"s right in front of me"" ""Twirling his bunch of keys"" ""He"s trying to woo me"" ""He torments me every moment"" - You are a good dancer. - Thanks for the compliment. Come beloved.... let"s celebrate the New Year. why not? Madam, Ram here. l just spotted Balram with a girl. He"s going with her to the room. l"m calling from Hotel Hill Town. l"ll be there in a moment. wait for me. This is my little home. what a beautiful house you have! The house is beautiful as a well as you. Come. Sit. Don"t be in such a hurry. Or else you might get lost forever. Come what may, but l will spend this splendid night with you. whatever the consequences are. what is this? This is a weapon. And it is not needed in this romance. l"ll keep it. Happy now? l"ll get a peg to make this night more splendid. l"ll be right back. - what are you doing? - Celebrating the new year. Don"t laugh! You killed my father lnspector Karma. l was waiting for this since 12 years... ... so that you beg at my feet for mercy. And die a miserable death. Rana is the cause for all this. we are only his subordinates. l see! So you are his dogs? That is why a dog deserves a dog"s death. l beg of you. Spare me. l will spare you on one condition. write as l tell you. will you write? what are you thinking? Quick. write. l am penancing for my sins. l am penancing for my sins. l am committing suicide. - Let me go now. - Sure. The revolver contains one bullet. l don"t know where. Now let"s see who lives and who dies. - Alright, first you try. - Okay. Now it"s your turn. l can see the fear of death on your face. Don"t be afraid. You are saved. Now your turn again. Now only two rounds to go. - lt"s the last one now. - Let me go. Forgive me. - You? - Yes, it"s me. - what are you doing here? - l"m doing 2 things at a time. - what? - l"m starting my motorbike, and... - And? l"m chewing a gum. l warned you that so late at night, ... lf you want to warn, go and warn those ... ... who compelled me to wander in the nights. l"ve wandered in the darkness so much,that now l hate the sun. Your words have pain and hatred in them. what had you gone through? Tell me. Perhaps l could help you. l am not like a flower who tells its story to everyone ... ... through its fragrance. l am like a thorn who never shared its sorrow with anyone. Anyway, forget it. would you like to have chewing gum? - No. - Okay, l"ll leave. Take care. Even you chew a gum like my younger sister. wish you were my younger sister. Looks like he committed suicide. - Constable. - Yes? - Send the body for post mortem. The killer managed to kill ... ... our two friends so easy. You have not experienced my strength. - when l ... - Shut up, you fool! Had God given you some brains too,... ... our friends wouldn"t die so miserably. l have so much brains,... ... that all the street dogs imitate me. Except that delicate darling Kiran. l will teach her such a lesson ... ... that you will be stunned. And if you don"t teach her a lesson,... ... you have already lost your eyesight. l will make your condition such that ... ... you will be left good for nothing. what are you saying? Sir, take a look at Balram"s photo. lt clearly shows that he did not commit suicide. He was murdered. This time you failed. lt"s clear from this photo that he shot himself. l don"t believe this is a murder. Sir, take out your gun. Please. Now aim it on your temple. Sir, why did you hold it on the right side? To die, one aims on the left side. - Like this? - Yes. No one will hold the gun in the right hand ... ... and aim it on the left temple. That"s what l want to tell you. See the photo carefully. He is holding the gun in his right hand. And the bullet was shot on the left side. You"re right. This means the murderer first killed Balram. To make the murder look like a suicide ... .... he made him hold the gun in his right hand. Then who could be the murder? They were four friends. Two of them are murdered. But it was make to look like an accident. The other two are yet to be murdered. The murderer could be one of them. Keep a strict watch on both of them. ls she avenging her father"s death, deceiving the police? You have obliged me by saving my life for the second time. l have not done any favour. Actually, l hate the police. l saved your life, because you are a noble person. Excuse me. You dropped your purse. You have obliged me by returning this purse. Had l lost this, l would have no reason to live. l think you are overburdened by sorrows. why don"t you share your sorrow with me? Perhaps it might lighten the burden. Tell me, what is your plight? You want to know? Reshmi, have you gone crazy? You shouldn"t fetch water in this condition. l would do it. why should you fetch water, when l am there? l don"t want our child to be caused any harm. Leave it there. Come and sit here. You didn"t even have the milk. - what happened? - You need to drink milk, not me. Have two glasses. One for you and one for my child. - l"m going to office. - But ... Don"t fetch any more water now. Oh God! what an ill-omen! Oh God! Protect him. Sorry, young man. This happened all of a sudden. - Are you alright? - The documents in this briefcase ... ... have to be handed over to the Chief Minister at any cost. How can l leave you in this condition? l can give up my life for this country. l request you to hand over these documents to the Chief Minister. lt is very urgent. - How will he identify me? - Here"s my identity card. No one will stop you if you show this. Hey mister, where are you going? whom do you want to meet? - l want to meet the CM. - what"s the matter? A man met with an accident. He requested me ... ... to give this briefcase to the CM. Okay. Today"s headlines. Terrorist Shiva under arrest. 40 personnel killed along with the CM. - You must read it. - Give change. - Give me one. lt"s a sensational news. Buy it. Today"s headlines! 40 personnel killed along with the CM. Shiva arrested. From all the evidences and witnesses, it has been proved... ... that along with the CM, 40 government employees ... ... were killed in the bomb blast. Your honour, l request the court ... ... that accused Shiva should be severely punished ... ... for betraying the country. So that all the traitors learn a lesson. Do you want to say anything in your defence? All what l want to say is,... ... that l am innocent. Only the inspector is responsible for everything. ln an injured condition, he gave me some documents ... ... to be given to the CM. The moment l delivered the suitcase, the bomb blasted. lt"s not my fault. The accused has been shown the photos of all the policemen. But he did not identify anyone. lt is clear that he has cooked up this story. And it is far from reality. He is a traitor. And so l request you to punish him severely. You do everything for money. You change the facts and send the innocent to the gallows. And save the culprits. Today it is proved that Law is really blind. which believes others. But don"t forget that there"s one more court above. His justice can destroy you and your law. Punish me. l am ready for it. This court sentences accused Shiva to life imprisonment. Didn"t get the baby with you? How is she? why don"t you speak? Don"t cry, Reshmi. Calm down. Even l will lose courage. There"s nothing to lose now. Had you brought the baby, l could have seen her once. l poisoned her to death. what are you saying, Reshmi? why did you kill her? ln this cruel world, the girl who does not have ... ... the shelter of her father, she has to suffer. l didn"t want my daughter to become a victim ... ... to the evil world. That is why l killed her. l killed her! very good! You did the right thing. She is lucky that she is no more. You take care of yourself. Take care of yourself for my sake. - l will. - Take care. l will take care of myself. l was sentenced to a life imprisonment ... ... under the charge of CM"s murder. And suddenly the jail where l was, caught fire. l put my life at stake and save jailer and his daughter. The government pardoned my punishment. l was released. Since that day, with the feeling of revenge in my heart, ... ... l"m wandering in search of that man ... ... you played this dirty prank with me. Do inform me, when you find him. l will surely get him punished. How will you get him punished? Law can"t give him the punishment, l want to give him. l will give his verdict. l would have shot lnspector Kiran. She would have been killed. l wonder from where that scoundrel Shiva came,... ... and saved her. Rana, is he the same Shiva ... ... whom you had framed in a bomb blast case? - How do you know? - 12 years ago ... ... l could see a little. And suddenly l read in the newspaper ... ... that Mr.Rana has framed Shiva in a bomb blast case ... ... and he was proved to be a terrorist. l agree that l"m a wicked man. But you turned out to be one step ahead of us. l have conspired ... ... to trap that police officer in the clutches of law. Beware! Don"t try to act smart or l"ll shoot you. Understand? - vijay, when did you come from London? - Forget about that. lt"s been 25 years since l came in this world. And in front of you, 25 seconds. - You scared the hell out of me. - why should you be scared? My guru says don"t be scared when you are in love.

That reminds me of my childhood. when l was passing from a mosque,... ...people went to offer prayers, and l stole their shoes. lf l went to the temple, l stole shoes there too. l would sell the shoes in the market. By God"s grace l would survive on it. By God"s grace, l found an original character for my film. Congratulation. You are running. You are wearing diamond studded shoes. And you face a girl whom you had raped 10 years ago. - l got it. - Then get ready for the shoot. - l"m ready. - And that girl shoots you. - Shoots me? - Yes, thrice. - Shoots Rana"s man? - what am l hearing? - The bullets will be fake. And even the blood will be false. You will die a false death. Films are never real. l"ll experience it. Call the make-up man.

No. How is that possible? lnspector Kiran is in jail. How could she kill that blind man Faslu? lmpossible! The way lnspector Khan had released us from jail ... ... for a short while so that we could kill lnspector Karma. And he put us in the lock up after committing the murder. Similarly, lnspector Kiran... No! lt"s me. You have to kill the CM again. The same bomb blast. Don"t worry about money. Your job will be done. Nowadays nothing is impossible. Only money is important. Pay and watch the blast. According to the Reserve Bank report, both the notes are real. You are innocent. You may join your duty from tomorrow. Now watch how l expose the real culprits.

By the way, where are you going? - Just a little further. - Okay. l enjoy traveling since childhood. l go anywhere around the world. Hey, watch out! Please get up. l"ll reach you to the hospital. Don"t worry about me. This bag has to be delivered to the CM. Because it contains very important documents. Don"t worry at all. l can lay my life for the country. l will deliver this bag to the CM at any cost. But how will he identify me? Take my identity card. No one will stop you there. l"ll deliver this bag to the CM. whom do you work for? won"t you speak up? - whom do you work for? - l don"t know anything. Really? Open the newspaper. Do you know him? - l"ll shoot you. - Yes. l work for him. Come with me. Rana, now your game is over. Listen to what l have to say. very cleverly, you killed my three friends. But you cannot harm me. Like the climax of every film, in this climax too... ... your mother is in my custody. And she will live till l am alive. Just find out from where the call was made. Just a moment. Okay. Madam, the call was made from Rana Farmhouse, Khandala. Your daughter joined the police force... ... only so that she could avenge her father"s death. And she killed my three friends. But she cannot cause me any harm. Because if she comes here to seek revenge ... ... and when she sees you in my custody ... ... her anger will subside. And she will become helpless. You committed several sins. You will surely die, no matter how. l will die later. First... Look how scared she is. The death is yet to arrive. Come, l"ll explain to you what you have to do. Did you understand what l explained to you? - Do as you are told. - Okay. - You may go. Hey you! l had sent you to kill the CM. How come you are at my feet? Look. You?! How come you are here? Today Shiva has come to do justice. You mean you will punish Rana?! You have wronged me. You are responsible for my daughter"s death. You killed my wife. l sentence you to death. l"m happy to hear your verdict. But perhaps you are unaware that you are surrounded by mines. One step forward, and you will turn into ashes. l"m prepared to die. These mines cannot cause me any harm. - Escape if you can. - Kill him. lt was fun. He wanted to do justice, indeed! He will turn to ashes. Scoundrel! He is alive. He shouldn"t escape. Kill him! Go and kill Shiva. Old woman! Come on, move. - Come on, old lady. - Rana, let my mother go. And surrender yourself to the police. l knew you would come. Because a daughter would surely come to rescue her mother. Move out of my way. Or l"ll shoot you and your mother. Stop, Rana! lf you shoot this helpless woman,... ... l will kill you. why will you shoot me? what enmity do you have with me? - who are you? - l"m lnspector Karma"s daughter Sapna. which means even she is your daughter. Remembered, whom you had killed? l have killed all your friends. lt is your turn now. You can"t escape today. Even you can"t escape, madam. Give me the gun. Hey, come here. Take her gun. lt is not meant for kids. lt can kill a person. Go and meet your daughter. - Go and meet your sister. - Come, mother. Meet to your heart"s content. - Mother! - My child! - My sister!

The girl whom l loved and wanted to marry ... ... is my father"s killer. Give it to me. l won"t spare her. - what is this? - l will surely shoot. Not her, but you. Because l know the truth. l came to know today how wicked my father was. l regret that l came to know this after his death. Or else l would have shot him right now. Don"t move. Look carefully. l have won. You all the defeated. Now l will kill you one by one. But first of all, this old woman will die. You scoundrel! Get up! l won"t spare you today. Stop, Shiva!
