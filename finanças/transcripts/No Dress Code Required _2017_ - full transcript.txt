Fer, tell me, when you were a kid, how did you imagine your wedding? When I was 7 years old my older sister did her first communion They bought her a hideous dress that I thought was beautiful With big metal hoops, like a bell that moved from side to side. It was beautiful to me. The party was over, and they dumped the dress inside a closet. One day my cousins came over and we decided to play wedding. I quickly jumped and said: I am the bride! Very proud. My cousins were like: What? Well, ok, If he wants to be the bride... So I put on the dress with the big metal hoops. I dragged it. We played we were at church, we ate gum instead of communion bread, and threw a bouquet I stole from my mother's vase... I threw a doll. It was like quinceañera and wedding! Very strange, but... ...it was because I saw it coming. I knew I would get married some day. But I should have worn a suit, not a dress, right? NO DRESS CODE REQUIRED At my salon, there are clients that tell me: Victor, I have a gay son. That's a big step, you have no idea. Before, a mother would never say she had a gay son! So, we thought: Everybody gets married, because they have rights. And my rights? What about my rights? We pay everything, and we can't get married. Because I want to marry a man, not a woman. He only eats damn junk food. Don't be rude. Don't you eat only deep fried food? -Taquitos, tostadas... -What will they think of me? How rude. I'm just worried about you. Maybe in a heterosexual couple there's no need to sign a paper, there are preconceived values. But with a gay couple it's necessary. It's a lie when they say: You'll be my brother in-law forever... I'll always love you... Not true. The brother dies and the family bond dies. Tough, but true. We want that protection that marriage gives you. When I gave my mom the news: Mom, we're getting married! Her first reaction was: I don't agree! Five minutes later, she calmed down. Son, just promise me one thing: Please don't be the one who carries the bouquet. That was her concern! I thought she was worried about society, laws, the tiffany chairs, anything! But no. It was the bouquet. She doesn't want me to throw it. I need someone to go pick up the musician at 6:30 pm at his hotel. It feels strange to say: After thousands of brides I've gotten ready, I am getting married. And I've seen all types: The happy one, the depressed one... And then, suddenly it's your turn. It's such a strange feeling to get so many brides ready... ...and suddenly to know you are in that place now. The moment has arrived and it's shaping up. Just imagine how many brides I've gotten ready in 23 years? It makes you think and say: Why have I gotten so many people ready, but I can't get married? At the beginning, when we said: Ok, let's get married. We never thought of getting married here. We thought it wasn't possible so we decided to get married in Mexico City. It was the first thing we thought. We didn't know anything, we were a couple of tourists who wanted to get married. Around that time... ...the news was spreading that Felipe Najera got married, and that they were the first gay couple... ...to legally adopt. So I sent him a Facebook message hoping it was a real profile, and he immediately wrote back, and said: Give me your phone number, please. He asked: Why do you want to get married in Mexico city? Because we can't here in Baja California. - Who told you can't? - You just can't. Of course you can. In any part of the country. I know the right person that will help you get married in Mexicali. He is my lawyer, his name is Alex Ali Mendez. The representative of the &quot;Oaxacan Front for the Respect and Recognition of Sexual Diversity&quot; Alex Ali Mendez Diaz, presented a collective writofamparo, before the third district judge against the State Congress. What we basically claim is that there's a status of inequality, between homosexuals and lesbians, in comparison with the guarantees that heterosexuals... ...have to get married. We started working in 2009. There was definitely prior work from others but through a group called &quot;Oaxacan Network for Sexual Diversity&quot; we began working to shed a light on this topic. And in 2011 when we were organizing our 3rd protest, a couple, Alejandro and Emanuel, approached us, saying: We want to get married, we know what's been happening in Mexico City, we want to look into the possibility of getting married in Oaxaca. And there's a thing I'll never forget about that moment when he asked me: If we are all Mexican... why do they have that right over there and we don't have it here? When I read the sentence carefully and saw that the court states clearly: &quot;It is the duty of the legislator to protect all families including same sex parents&quot; I realized that, if you have an obligation but here in Oaxaca those families are not being protected, there was a gap that the law has to fill somehow since it cannot leave these families unprotected. I said: we can design a legal strategy, a writ of amparo (appeal on the grounds of unconstitutionality). I've always said that I honestly had no idea where I was getting myself into. What I was going to achieve? or how far this would come. The supreme court of the nation granted an amparo to three homosexual couples to get the local civil registry, to authorize their marriages, and will be the first in Mexico to be formalized by Judicial Power of the Federation. The marriages of these three couples, two are female and one male, will be registered once the notification comes thru. He got in touch with us. He told us: The first thing you need to do is to get a lawyer in Mexicali, with whom I can work from a distance. Perfect. That's when Jose Luis Marquez, came into the picture. I was reading the judicial weekly: a book where they publish the most relevant sentences of the country. Looking at the sentences, I saw that they were granting amparos for same sex couples to get married. If these amparos would’ve been promoted in 1950, when they were barely starting to accept women's right to vote... when they couldn't even conceive that men and women were equal, they definitely couldn't have conceived two men getting married. So I realized that the time had come. I was excited to be a part of the change. To me, the decision came in a difficult time. I thought: Should I do it or not? Do I address this issue as a lawyer or not? And what was difficult at that time for me was that people would think I was gay. So just like jumping into a cold pool, I decided to hope for the best. I started looking around. Who wanted to get married? I really wasn't close to anyone who was gay. I thought: What should I do? Go to gay bars? There I went, at 6 pm, when they're cleaning up and such, and I met a friend, Juan. I told him about it and he said: You know what? I know a couple. Jose Luis said: I'll marry them here. Tell them not to go Everything fell into place. When we saw his enthusiasm to represent this case, the only thing we told him was: We need you to work this case with the other Lawyer, Alex Ali Mendez Diaz. Well, any lawyer that would take the case, as I did, would be taking the idea from Alex. So the guys and I made a deal, and we began. You have to invite God to the bedroom, before having sex. Sex, is like a lettuce. The lettuce and the tomato get together and make a salad. Wives: there are decisions you have to participate in... Don't let your husbands bring pornography into your homes. There are too many children abused by their fathers that let pornography into their homes. -Shouldn't they give one for each? -It's one per couple. Yes! Apparently easy... up to now. Tomorrow we'll submit the request for marriage. It seems like we have all the requirements. I was born in the state of Sinaloa. In the city of Guasave. I was born in a low middle class family, in a healthy environment. I don't come from a dysfunctional family, there are no traumas. We are a laid back family. I was a very delicate kid. Everyone could tell I was gay but I was the last one to notice. I was me, that's it. Besides, I was an extrovert. In school festivals I would always perform. Act 8: Fernando. Act 9: Fernando. A pain in the ass. But my parents always supported me. I would also play with my sister's Barbie dolls. I would hide and play with them. They would come home and find all the dolls made up and would ask: -Who did that? -I don't know. My imaginary friend would fix them up. But they always looked modern, chic. And my sisters, they always knew, but never talked about it. I was always surrounded by women. At home, there were always girls, many cousins, and at school many girlfriends because boys would bully me. I couldn't hang out and play with kids my age because I didn't fit in. And really, I didn't understand: Why is everyone against me? If I am not weak, I don't let them tease me... then why are they always waiting outside to beat me up? They call me fag, homo. The worst part is that I didn't even know what that meant. I was born in Mexicali, Baja California. It was the year 1971. Oops! I think I just gave my age away. I am the youngest of my family. I come from a family of 8 brothers and sisters. We just had our mom, there was no father. My mom was a warrior, a great warrior, she was my hero, and she will always be. I was raised in the Mexicali Valley, Guadalupe Victoria City. When the first settlers came here, some went to work to the cotton fields. My mom was among those people. When school was out, we had to go work in the fields to bring home some money. I really didn't understand where I was standing, where I lived, my surroundings… When I understood I discovered that I lived in a... ...very poor family. I always say, “beyond poor”. They would call us “the circus people” because we would jump from house to house. When rent was due, there was no money to pay. My mom tried really hard. She would go to all the fruit stands... ...to get the ripe fruit nobody wanted. It was hard for me to work next to my mom for so many years, because at the end of the day, I always knew my inclinations. I always avoided being close to people or kids, I didn’t want them to call me gay or faggot. Because I was afraid that my mom would hear it and find out. Here are the papers, they have the date and time. Here is the name of one of the grooms, Victor Manuel Aguirre Espinoza. And, here is the application, with the Civil Registry stamp. There seems to be a misunderstanding according to the City official. Can you tell us what they told you? That there was a misunderstanding, they registered the wedding of a man and a woman. That they didn't know two men were coming, even though we've done everything in a transparent way. I don't handle the books, I don't write down the appointments. But they will give us an answer today. They already said it would be a negative one. We had a hope, one in a million maybe, but we will continue fighting. We knew from the start that the process would be like this. We had to have an amparo, because the law doesn't allow it here, but we’re OK. We’ll continue the fight. What will you do in case you don't win the amparo and can't get married? I could tell you we'll go to Mexico City and get married but we don't want to, because it wouldn't be valid here. We want to keep on fighting and let's see what happens. Governor Osuna Millan made reforms to stop sex same marriages, what is your message? They have to stick to the law, their personal thoughts are theirs and we respect them, but our honorable governor is not the owner of the state. Only woman can give life. That's why I don't approve same sex marriages in Baja California, because it's impossible for them to give life, to start a family. Neither do congressmen right? Don't go approving one of those weird laws. Also our mayor, from the PRI party, talks and says a bunch of nonsense. I don't understand why no one takes care of his speeches, he forgets there are cameras, his level of ignorance is so embarrassing. As elected mayor, what is your opinion on the Supremes’ court ruling of recognizing gay marriages in the entire country? I am not in favor, but it is something that is happening in Mexico City, and if it opens up to the rest of the country, we have to review it here in the state government, to see if it’s viable or not. It’s something that state congress should also review. I don't think it's something that... ...would benefit the city. I believe in family, I believe in values, I am not in favor. Then the possibility of adoption is ruled out? It would be the worst thing, I don’t agree. Also the horrible comments... ...that people have left on every article... ...of every newspaper, interview. Or open forums, where people leave their opinions. God made us to… to be normal. Each person with their couple. But same sex? Would you look cute in bed with another man? It's ok, if they get married and are same sex. But they shouldn't be able to adopt. It's supposed to be girl with boy, isn't it? Because boy with boy doesn’t match. Many say that maybe it's because of the diet, that a bad diet is at fault. But no, it's all distortions, degeneracy of the civilization. The 12th District Judge ruled in favor of Victor Manuel Aguirre and Victor Fernando Urias to be married in this city. Today October 14th 2013 is a great day for Baja California. Victor and Fernando decided... ...to start this process, because the current mayor conditioned their right to marry through the civil registry Clerk, unless an amparo was granted to them. So finally today, we've been notified the sentence, which is in our favor. Which means that the 12th district... ...orders the civil registry clerk to marry them. You've been waiting for hours. Hello! It's so great! It's so great! We did it... we did it… I want to cry. Hey, we haven't hugged all day. I swear. I just realized. He wanted to cry earlier. But I didn't let him. During an interview, he wanted to cry. I told him hey, calm down, not here… But here you can do it. Right now I can honestly say I am starting to realize that we won. That you're going to get married. That we are going to get married. “We want to get married now” I said in an interview earlier. People we don't want to get married. We are going to get married! It's a fact. Once we walk out with our marriage certificate, and rub it into society's faces, that day, no one will know anything about us anymore. You may see this fight as something happening from June until today. But no, that's not true, that's not true. It is a fight that I've fought since I knew I was gay. Since that day a fight with life began. And you can't see it. But really… Nothing has been as I imagined when it all began. When I said: &quot;I just want us to be the first gay couple to marry&quot; it's not like that. Now I get it. when people told me: Do you know what you're getting yourself in to? I didn't understand. Because it means digging up my own life. To bring out my true memories. Things that I once said: They're forgotten, buried, I'm over that. And it's not true. I was way at the back. Arranging the boxes so they wouldn't fall off the conveyor belt. And my mom was in this corner. She would put paper on top so they could fill up the boxes with ice. When my mom caught me for the first time putting on my “show” because I had that thing going on... ...you know, that feeling. My work area was on that side and there were some tables And I started to dance... ...on the tables... ...at the lunch break. And everybody cheered? Yes! People would surround the table to see me dance. It was spectacular! My mom came walking down that ramp with her friends and she saw me dancing and I froze and thought: Either I continue or I get down from here... I decided to keep on dancing, because the show was more important! The performance! So I kept on dancing. And my mom just walked away. I knew she was a little sad. But she never said anything, not even on the way home. Nothing. Many things that she heard about me at work, she never mentioned at home. She became my accomplice. But when the bullying of the kids, and my co-workers became way too obvious, I only wanted to run away from home. It wasn’t that I wanted to find a better life. No! I didn't even think of that. The only thing I wanted was to avoid my family the pain of something I already knew: what it meant to be gay. And I didn't want to hide it anymore. Being gay was something deplorable, reproachable, not well seen. Even worse if you were open about it. Some girlfriends told me: We're going to Mexicali. And I said: I'm going with you! I had to take control of my life, build up the courage, and finally, be strong. I realized that I had to change my attitude, so people would respect me. I was looking for my happiness. Hello! Mami! -You're all dressed up! How pretty! -I put on gloss. Uncle! I put on gloss. Oh! You are all done up! And my little shoes! Did you tell Cristina what were we saying? Cristina is the director and you are? - The make up artist. - What are we calling the movie? It will be called: Victor and Fernando… The Stars… Victor and Fernando the most handsome and... famous stylists. The most handsome and famous stylists? -Yes. -Ok. Because we still don't have a name for the movie. Yeah, well. I chose the name. My mind told me! Your mind told you? -You have many good ideas. -Yes. In junior high he even had a girlfriend! He now says it was to make his father happy. He had a girlfriend and we were so happy! He even brought her home and everything. This was my girlfriend from Nayarit. I look so young. We went to Tijuana, but we were never intimate. She became my best friend. When I was 17 years old, my family and I had such a bad relationship, that my best girlfriend and I ran away to Tijuana for a weekend. We went to a gay bar. The first time I went into a gay bar. I met a guy, he flattered me all night long, he wooed me. I was like: Wow! At last a man that will stand by me and will love and respect me for the rest of my life! So I go back home, tell all the truth to my family, grab my bags and move to Tijuana! For me it was like taking off the blindfold, expose myself and say: I'm gay and don't say you didn't know! Because you are my sister, my brother, my mother, my father. Don't say you didn't know. Don't act surprised! I said: No son, you are wrong. We should go see a psychologist, so she can help you change your mind. He said: No, no. I won't go to a psychologist, I am who I am, I don't want to hear anymore of it. I had just turned 18, I was very young. I stayed with this guy for 8 months. It didn't last long. I still felt so guilty about my family thinking I would humiliate them! But why? I didn't ask to be this way. So I decide to stay in Tijuana. I thought: I already opened my big mouth, so now I'm staying and figuring this out on my own! I found a job, started to save money. I made my family think that everything was great. So they wouldn’t worry. I stayed in Tijuana for ten years. When I turned 27, my story really changed… ...when we met. I was coming out of a relationship, so was Fernando. I went out with a girlfriend. She took me out because I was depressed, you know, when love gets you down. She was very persistent, that I should meet someone. She would say: That guy over there. Do you like him? Of course not! That one? Nope, I don't like him either. I was so bitter, I didn't want to know about anyone or anything. And suddenly, my beautiful and adored, almost husband, walked by. And I said: I like that one. And she said: so send him a beer! And I said: No! I don't send beers! But she convinced me and I sent him the beer. And he sent it back! He rejected it! So I asked the waiter, Why didn't he want it? He didn't want it! He said he doesn't take beers from anyone. So I was in shock! But I got more excited! Well, now go back there and tell him to take it, because I sent it! -Now take him two beers! -Now take him two! He did catch my eye, but… It's just that 9 years ago, this man, was… -He had Hair! -He was another man! He is so much more handsome now! He is like wine! He gets better with time! When I met him he was skinny... ...had long hair... ...highlights... ...bracelets and earrings. His personality was completely different. When I saw all the tattoos on his back, I got spooked. “Oh my god! This guy looks like a crack head!&quot; Can you imagine? That's what he's said about me. I wasn't shocked at first sight I didn’t see him, and feel… Wow I'm in Love! No. It happened as the hours passed. As we talked and talked. And discovered we had so much in common. That's what made me fall in love. And so, our relationship began. He came to visit, I went. The need to stay together grew bigger and bigger each time. So after two months dating, we went to Ensenada for a romantic weekend. You know, once there, the ocean, the waves, the seashells... ...the turquoise blue. So in an instant I said. This shouldn't end. Ever! So just like that. From one day to another I was back in Mexicali, after 10 years of not living here. In love, happy, with many projects and plans. Not knowing how to start, but together, having each other. So our story began. With its ups and downs. Sometimes great, sometimes bad. Sometimes boring. Normal! Since I realized I liked boys, I dreamed about getting married. About having a party, a groom, my pictures, my big cake. It was something I always pictured in my life. Out there, somewhere, there is someone that will want to marry me. If it's not you, It's the next, but someday I will get married. One day I will have that life plan. For many people, “the rest of our lives” means growing old. Not for me. The rest of our lives can last a year, two years, or whatever... but I want to spend it with him. -Together till the end, right? -That's right. The city government of Mexicali will revise the amparo from the 12th District Judge, granted from the marriage application of Victor Aguirre Espinoza and Victor Fernando Urias. Don’t interpret this as something against the couple or the lawyer, in legal matters you have to resort to the last option. If you are left with nothing… well These amparos are used in the entire country, Mexicali is no exception. Authorities have tried to invalidate sentences granted to these couples. Because there is no knowledge of what is already happening in these cases all over the country. Therefore, they just delay the inevitable. The lawyer said: you have the option of getting married right now, or we'll have our case taken to the Supreme court. It would take a few more months, but your case, besides being the first one, it would set a legal precedent. At first, the plan was, selfishly, just to get married. But now, after all this time, and so many people supporting us and asking for help, because they too want to marry, you realize you have to work for others as well. So we decided to wait, so the benefit would be for all. So if we have to wait 3, 4 or 5, 6 months we will wait until the revision is finalized. The 5 ministers of the Mexican Supreme Court unanimously granted the amparo for the first gay wedding in Baja California and against the 7th article of the State Constitution. The first amparo that was granted, and that was refuted by the authorities is finally confirmed and reaffirms that Victor and Fernando can get married. The auhorities, like The civil registry. are obligated to not discriminate them and give them the same treatment as every else, and marry them. We have arrived to what we may call: the ceiling of justice. In the stage we are at right now, there is nothing more they can do. Once the verdict from the Supreme Court is official the authorities cannot refuse or oppose the decision. The lawyer detailed that the time the procedure will take is about 1 month. What document did they send you? The notice that states that we can come and set a date. So now they will give you a date? We hope so, that is what we came for. To set a date. So this is the thing… The dates for November are practically taken. because these people came in October and made their reservation on time. Let me tell you something about the wait. We have already waited one year and four months! Seven months. Seven months! We were here way before these people came, so I think that you should have a little bit of consideration… As the lawyer says we're not even asking for a date for tomorrow, nor next week. Let me check, for a moment my calendar… it could be the 21st. The date is reserved, right? ...Victor Manuel Aguirre Espinoza, Victor Fernando Urias… Your telephone numbers, November 21st, from 8:30 to 9:00 am. Reserved. Now I'm clicking save. We reached an agreement with the Civil registry official, everything is perfect, they are sticking to the procedure, we have set a date for November 21st at 8:30 am. It's the day we will sign and get married. That day I want to feel like I came out of a black and white film. Dick Tracy style. YOU MAKE VERY HAPPY, I LOVE YOU! When I came in, he didn't say a word. He said, “we'll talk in a while” And I saw the note. I almost cried. He's been sensitive all day. I felt excited and fine. But then, the lawyer calls us... ...and tells me that the Civil Registry sent a notification that said they were not going to marry us tomorrow! That they wanted to see us at 2 pm when the wedding appointment is at 8:30 am They had already set a date, we have already organized a party! We already have guests that are coming from everywhere, from out state, that already spent their money, they already made reservations at hotels to stay here… All of that! It makes me so angry. Why the hell do they want to put another obstacle! Now, after this, we have go to the Civil registry, and again hear explanations about why they don't want to marry us. It's enough to… ...to not want to get married anymore. You have to be in one piece and give a fight to the last minute. Even if they say no, just like the first time they told us: We won’t marry you. The hell you won't! I want people to say: Nothing breaks those guys they are still in one piece. Yes my love! I love him. It's just that...! You hit the jackpot Victor! I don't understand why… I can't say he's making a mountain out of a molehill Because this is not a molehill. But honey, stay cool. I feel like I'm doing my first communion. All in white. -Do we look nice? -Are you ok? -We can't hide. -Whatever happens. Oh my! AS THE CHURCH WE DON'T AGREE WITH SAME SEX MARRIAGE. MEXICO NEEDS JESUS CHRIST. Excuse me, we've been here for 20 minutes, and no one is doing anything. Is there some one who can give us an answer? You’ll have to see it with the Civil Registry official, everything is directly with her. And you, sitting over there, who are you representing? I am here to officiate weddings but I've not been notified of this one. But we had an appointment. We're here. Go with the Civil Registry official. - Is she coming? - I don't know. As a public official can you give us your name? - No. Yes, you should give it, it's your obligation, our taxes pay your salary. What is your name? We have rights and we are exercising them! Excuse me. Sorry. If you will not budge, won't it be better, in order to end this, that the witnesses go with her, alone. They are our friends, they will tell us what the problem is. Because we are in a point where nothing’s happening, and we are hindering the other couples who are outside. I feel bad, that because of us… -Not because of us -Because of them! They can tell the four of you what is happening and you tell us and that's the end of problem. This is very exhausting. Let's go here to the left, down the hall. Let's see about our problem, ok? I have to go and see my boss and then I'll be back. No, no, no, no They say there is a bomb threat Is that true? Look, there is a call from C4. You resorted to that? I have a call from C4. Yeah right... It's not like you didn't have communication with them. Who do you take us for? Like high school kids, the city officials to save themselves from the final exam, make a false bomb threat... That is your level of ridiculousness. What you've come to. So you can't tell us anything? We are the witnesses. -We can talk while we walk outside. -What is your fear? I’m going to wait for her to come, maybe she can come sooner. Ok, we’ll wait for her. She didn't leave instructions or what? What is going to happen with all the other weddings? None of them are taking place? We must stress that they are paralyzing the entire municipal administration they are paralyzing it, to keep Victor and Fernando from marrying… right now. Because they will get married. This is not an option, this is an obligation. They will get married. The only thing they accomplished is not marring them today but they know that they will have to marry them. What we will do, is come to the appointment at 2:30 pm. Upstairs, again? But we'll meet at 2 pm here with the civil registry official because she is the one who wants to see us. Right now, Marquez was stopped by an attorney I've never seen before, and he told him: Hey, you are destroying the family. Marquez replied: Are you serious? He said, yes, it's no joke. You're not joking? No joke, you are destroying the family. He is the devil's advocate now. A homewrecker. Good afternoon to all, welcome. This meeting is to inform you about the case of Victor Manuel Aguirre Espinoza and Victor Fernando Urias About the notification regarding... ...these two citizens present here today that was sent to them yesterday around 2:17 in the afternoon. I ask you, Mr. Victor Manuel Aguirre Espinoza and Mr. Victor Fernando Urias did you make... ...a marriage request to this office? Yes - Mr. Victor… - Yes. Mr. Victor Manuel Aguirre Espinoza and Mr. Victor Fernando Urias - Did you sign this request form? - Yes. - For marriage... both of you? - Yes, that’s right Mr. Victor Manuel Aguirre Espinoza and Mr. Victor Fernando Urias What are the names of the witnesses that you mention on this form?

Ok, I would like… - Name and signature, here please. - O.K. This procedure, I would appreciate If you could explain and justify it to us. - What is this about? - When we finish… No, no… right now. What's happening is already annoying. What’s going on? If you don't continue with the normal procedure… -You call this a normal procedure? -Yes. Can you please tell us what is this about? You Ma'am, can you? We received a document, about some inconsistencies... What are they? They're these! We already informed you, yesterday. The documents just states inconsistencies it's vague... confusing - We will explain when we finish this - No! Now! Do you want us to stop, or shall we continue? You would be the one's stopping this. There are certain procedures, you know this as a lawyer. From which law is this procedure? to say the truth, I don't know… The Civil Code empowers the officer to… To do what? To confirm that all of the information. If these are your signatures, what is the problem? Oh, so the problems are the signatures? - Please sign. - Ok, perfect. Do we recognize our signatures? - Yes Here attorney, name and signature. Now, we will proceed to certify the authenticity of these signatures. Excuse me are you a specialist? By what authority will you do this? There is no need to be specialized when the code or the law empowers me to do it. In some cases, if I have doubts of a document or if there is something that I must certify, the law empowers me to do so. But calm down attorney, please. But if we recognize that we signed the document, isn't it enough? May I ma'am, please? It's not a question of whether they signed, or didn't… The issue is that when the request was made there could have been false information. You, the four witnesses claim that you did sign the request. - You're sure? Ok. - Yes As I told you some seconds ago, the discrepancies are obvious. Even if I am not a specialist, it's easy to notice the differences. If the media wants to take pictures, go ahead. Ok, we got it… but we are here, Now, this office will evaluate. Finish the meeting… We can change the witnesses, or what do you suggest? If you believe these are not their signatures… Well, It's not just that, there are other discrepancies. In their birth certificate, in their CURP (Unique Population Registry Key). The numbers don't coincide, the page number, the book number… - But we didn't make those documents! - Neither did we. Don't debate, finish! No, no, they simply don't coincide. Just say you're looking for an excuse to not marry them. We request that both applicants, as soon as possible, correct these inconsistencies, and when they decide to, or when they get the chance to fix these problems they can come again and show us the corrected documents, and of course they should match this time! You want us to go to the Secretariat of the Interior to fix something from their CURP? We don't know if the CURP is the problem or the birth certificate. So the mistake is yours? Or of the Secretariat of the Interior? This is a joke. I'm just inviting you, the grooms to fix the issues, and then we will consider… - You will consider? - Yes, once corrected. - We need to look it over. - Do you do this with everybody? Of course, I'm not lying. - Are we done? - Yes. We are done already, aren't we? there is nothing more… Great. Can you please tell me the legal base of this procedure? Because you told me that you would tell me once we were finished. -Can you please tell me? -We will send it to you in writing. Then you weren't going to tell me at the end? We will gladly give you an official written notice. The problem is first you say something then you say something else… You told me, “Let’s finish and we will tell you the legal base”. Now you're saying that you’ll give it to us later, in writing. And again this local government, just like the last one is looking for a way to not marry this couple. How many mayors must come and go? Why doesn’t the mayor show his face? You're been passing this from one mayor to another, for for how many years!? It's the third time, It's the third time… do you know what it means to us? They pay their taxes! Can't you see how exhausting this is? How it wears us down? To come here, for the third time, waiting for an explanation. This is the thing, meet the requirements and we will happily set a date to marry you. You are a bunch of incompetents. Thanks we’ll bring you a piece of cake. Because all we spent was for you. We'll send you pictures of the party. Let's go we are late for the party. I can't answer thank you very much, please ask the attorney. They were rejecting to enforce an amparo of the Supreme Court of the Nation, that's what they were doing. The district court analyzed it and saw it as a felony, a contempt to the amparo So they begin to prosecute them, and they question them, and warn them. What are the legal grounds to ask for all that paperwork to the guys? What are the laws and articles that demand the signatures, the CURP, and everything they asked them? And they warned them, that if there was no legal base, they would be committing a felony. So, we saw each other again on December 10th. We were invited to a private meeting, to review the documents and set a new date. They went over the papers we had to present according to the Civil Registry Code. They said: Birth certificates. The problem with Fernando’s birth certificate is that it says United States of Mexico... and the problem with Victor's is that his says Mexican Republic, and that is not valid anymore. And that phrase is not valid, it's ancient because it says Mexican Republic. But it's still valid. It's a birth certificate! And it doesn't expire. So that was the first issue. But they said: Ok, ok, it's just that we were worried that maybe in the future you could have problems. Yeah, very worried right! You know the inheritance and everything right? Very worried for your well-being. Yes, worried for our future, to assure our well-being. Then they said: Ok, it's ok, we'll correct that… check. ID's, check Witnesses' ID's, check.. ok! In the requirements they asked for a health certificate. And they required a paragraph that says that we are free from STDS's and tuberculosis. Which is a line from 1920 or 1940, when they were terrorized by those stuff that weren't controlled. But, nowadays everybody has STD's and still get married! Even the doctor told us! He was confused when we told him! He said: What? Fernando this is not the first marriage health certificate I give out. I've done many! And I've never been asked to do one like this! I always write who I am, and my credentials, and under oath I certify that these two people are fit to get married. That's It! Just like I gave you last time. Well, sorry doc, but it has to say this. And he did a new one. But as Eneida says, it was with malice. Everything has been done with bad intentions… So, I find it rather mean, we've had to suck it up, and say: ok, they already assumed I had AIDS, syphilis, lice!… Ok, such is life, I'll suck it up and say: here is my document that says that I don't have those things you say I have. To doubt the authenticity of a signature you need an expert. Just like those shows, like CSI with the forensics, using a magnifying glass, and scanner. Something like that should be done. That’s why I asked: Did you analyze those signatures? The second time, on December 10th, they took the signatures and did this: At a rough guess these are your signatures, and they put the paper aside. That was their CSI? That was their CSI Mexicali. We filed a complaint, and the District Judge, requested, once again, that they should comply with the sentence. Telling them: You didn't comply, and I urge you to do it, because if you don't we will proceed according to the amparo laws which means we will apply the proper penalties if you still fail to comply, without reason. So, the ceremony was rescheduled... ...for January 10th. The Monday before January 10th the guys received unofficial information I received it too, just after they did. They told them... that someone had submitted a complaint, a legal impediment to stop the marriage. The reason they claimed, was that the guys had never been to the premarital talks. But they didn’t know that we had filmed these talks. So we asked our friend Cris, who had the video... to send us the file to make it viral. So everybody could see it. I make the official handover of the legal document, to our attorney. We have evidence that you came to these talks. But still, we decided to go to the premarital talk, again. Fernando went in first, And when it was just about to begin, I came in and sat next to him. When the man saw me, he immediately stopped the whole thing. In that moment he said: For today, there will be no more premarital talks. You know that love is forever, stay together, and bam! He kicked us all out. Everybody started to complain about the little paper, because everyone wanted the damn little paper. Aren't you going to give us a voucher? Yes, for those who came here before- you were here before, can you wait? Everyone else, can you make a line over here? I will give you the paper. She set us aside, but Jose Luis said: go stand in line. We stood in the back of the line. Like fifty people or more. We already spoke with you, don’t play dumb. - Dumb?! - Yes, dumb. - She says we should stop playing dumb. Yes sir, you already came here last time. So they did come? - And you gave false information. - False Information?! - Yes. They lied, and claimed they were a man and a woman. Yes Saavedra, they already came. And now they can leave. I have no obligation to say anything more. Thank you. We are at wits’ end. I can't endure such injustice. I feel stepped on. When the law changes you can ask for whatever you want. If the law hasn't changed, NO! Don't you care about a document from the Supreme Court? Those men are only five, and here in Baja California we are a population. Yes, but the Supreme Court is above all of these people. It's our right ma'am. I don't doubt it, nobody has taken that right from you. Just like you have an honorable husband, and you have an honorable marriage ma'am. - Where's the car? - A block away. Just like you have an honorable marriage and family… Sorry, excuse me, we have to leave. You must respect that there are other families. And there will be other families. Obviously this is all a strategy, a government strategy. They say: Ok, we as the civil registry. We don't have a problem. We can't expose ourselves, because we already gave them a signed document that says that we agree with a marriage date. We checked out all their documents… That paper says that all the documents have been turned in, and everything is in order signed by the Senior Official. So they say: Now what can we do? What should we do? I can swear that they had a meeting just to figure out how to screw with us. On Friday, around 8 pm, I received a call from the Civil Registry Officer. She asked me to go to her office, I was sure it was about the premarital talks. I went prepared, with my cell phone, with the video of the talks. And when I get there, the City Hall is closed. The door opens and the Civil Registry Officer is there. She is there with four other people, and a fifth man with a camera. They notify me of a complaint of impediment. A complaint of impediment... what is it about? She said: I wont be able to marry them. I really couldn't believe it. At that time of night you're notifying me this? I could’ve not gone and they wouldn't have notified me this. I could have not gone. But I wanted to go because… we have managed all of the procedure with transparency, we haven't hidden at all. That's the way I work, and that's how we work with the guys. And I couldn't believe it, really. For a moment... ...my eyesight went blurry, I couldn't digest it. I got very angry, I remember that I leaned forward. I grabbed my forehead with my fingers, stroking my forehead, tears of anger rolled out. I didn’t want them to notice. I was broken. I told them I was angry, and they were recording me. Did they tell you what the complaint was about? No, it was in writing, they told me to read and to sign. There will come days of weeping and lamentation Lord. In the name of Jesus, forgive them. You have established your kingdom Lord. You have established your word Lord. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth... You are the all mighty, for you nothing is impossible... The doors are closed since 2 O'clock. - Really? - Yes. - What did they inform you? - They said, no. What was the last thing they told you? That there was a complaint that Victor and Fernando suffer dementia. They want to conduct some studies, psychological, psychiatric, to confirm if they are mentally fit to marry. Who said that, the Civil Register? The lady in charge of… - Adriana? - Angelica. Angelica presented the complaint, but does she belong to an organization or is she a simple civilian? She is a volunteer that gives premarital talks. The Civil Register Officer received the complaint and said that at this time, they cannot marry them. Who's going to chose the doctor? This is just ridiculous. What do you think of the opinions against you? I believe that everybody has the right to give their opinion or express themselves against or in favor, but only if this doesn't affect our integrity. Respect ladies and gentlemen. I respect that you don’t support our movement, and there is no problem with that, but I ask you to respect us back. Because we aren’t violent towards you or any person that’s against us. Besides, we are fighting for a legal right. Legal rights have nothing to do with religious ideologies, I respect them but don’t mix one with the other, they have nothing in common. Let God do his job by himself, he has a lot on his hands, let him do his job. How do you feel about the insanity arguments to cancel the wedding? Fernando already said it, really, who seemed crazy was that lady because she couldn’t even stay calm. We’ve been as you see us now, with this serenity that will not leave us, till the end. It’s 2:32! Let them walk, please. And again, just one day before, they receive a document, in an illegal way that, again, had legal inconsistencies. First, the complaint was presented by a citizen that represents an organization. For starters, legally, that’s not possible. Organizations have no say in marriage topics. On the other hand she claims dementia as an impediment. I mean, that’s like... in what century do we live in? When Jose Luis told me, they accused them of dementia. I was like: what? I thought I had seen it all, but then you realize that for many things we are really naive, you think that it couldn’t happen, and look, it did. The front represents our friends that support us, the back represents Inclusion, it includes al Baja California and all humans, we are all Baja California. - Well I felt very angry but... - A little bit more, please- Instead of getting down and cry or get angry, I wanted a solution. What’s next? I was desperate, that’s why I sent Felipe the message: Help us please, we don’t know what to do. I saw it maybe as the part of the solution, reaching out to someone that can open doors for us, and help us out in Mexico City. So the next morning he sent us a message and said, I am waiting for you but come now. Hi! It's the next door. Hi! How are you? We were interviewed by Milenio, Reforma, Proceso, El Hueso from W radio, Imex, an LGBT station, Animal Politico… So we got there, we went to The Mexican Congress, the Chamber of Deputies to the permanent press room. My partner and I are here with outrage and embarrassment outraged for the cynical and embarrassing actions we have been victims of by the authorities of the City Hall and Civil Registry of Mexicali, Baja California. We are embarrassed for needing to leave our state in search of justice, because our legislators and state authorities have done nothing about it. On the contrary, they ignore it in obvious complicity with the double standard that prevails in our state. What began as a case of intolerance and homophobia, has become a case of insanity. And, yes, we must be crazy, because we still trust the law and the institutions, that's why today, in this place, the home of all Mexicans, we demand that the law must be followed, and that you, our representatives, enforce our rights. Thank you very much. Hello, I'm Felipe Najera and I'm here with Victor and Fernando, to invite you to the protest: Mexicali against homophobia this Saturday, January 17th, at 10am in City Hall. We want to thank Ana Paola Pereira and Diego Vargas. That's right, we invite you to this protest, which will be a peaceful one, don't forget that today we support Victor and Fernando's cause, but our rights are constantly being violated in different parts of the country. We'll see you there, this Saturday at 10, and don't forget to keep on using the hashtag: #myrightsarenotinsanity We would be thankful to see you there. We'll see you, thank you very much. The only thing I want, is to go and thank everyone, and come right back home to sleep and rest. I want this to be over with. Everything will be ok, when you feel down, take my hand and squeeze it to let me know that you aren't feeling well. Here is the gay resistance! Here is the gay resistance! Victor and I want to thank your presence and joy this morning. We are filled with satisfaction to see that today, the apathy and fear stayed home. We are here, free citizens, that want our voices to be heard facing abuses by our authorities, because the discrimination, and violations of our rights, the contempt of our authorities to an amparo granted by our highest court is everybody's business. Today is the time to break the chains and leave the fear of rejection behind! Because Baja California is facing the challenge of becoming a mature and progressive society, open to social changes that guarantees, respects and protects, everybody's human rights. We are convinced that in a state ruled by laws, a lawful government must prevail above the beliefs of a man or a group. And we won't rest until there is a legal recognition of our union as a couple, until the law is respected in our state unlike today, when it only grants privilege to some. Thank you very much. I would like to say to you that the 21st local government of Mexicali and the mayor of this city, Jaime Rafael Diaz Ochoa, have always been respectful towards the rights of our citizens. Liar! One of the advisers came outside, and invited us to meet the mayor, who wanted to talk to us. Strangely they asked us, very strictly, to come in without cell phones or any media, just us. MURDERING GOVERNMENT, YOU ARE SCARED OF A WEDDING. I'm glad to inform you that Victor, Fernando and the Mayor have finished talking. And they have decided that they... ...will be married... ...right now! They will be married right here, in a few minutes, you will witness the wedding. Good afternoon. Representing the 21st local government of Mexicali, I will begin the civil act for this couple that has decided to unite in marriage. It's my duty to ask everybody that is here united… YES! NO! It's my duty to ask everybody that is here united, if you know a reason or legal impediment that could stop this marriage? - NO! It is also my duty to ask, these two grooms if you have decided to marry on your own will? YES! without anything forcing you? Your answer must be: I am here on my own free will. I am here on my own free will. I am here on my own free will, also. Victor Manuel Aguirre Espinoza, do you take Victor Fernando Urias as your lawfully wedded husband? Yes, I do! Victor Fernando Urias, do you take Victor Manuel Aguirre Espinoza as your lawfully wedded husband? Yes, I do! Today, January 17th 2015, without impediment for this marriage, I declare you, before the law and society as a new marriage. We did it! We did it! The fact they married the way they did, I don't know if it was unbeatable… But it was way better than we imagined. It was a fight of David against Goliath. We're saying that they were fighting against the whole state apparatus. We talked to the mayor, and asked him, once they we're married, to come down and shake their hands. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Congratulations. Cheers! Kiss, kiss, kiss! We did it! We did it! We are actually fighting for the quality of life we deserve as human beings. They don't know how hard it is to be yourself in this country. There's this part: if it doesn't happen to me… it isn't a problem… until it does. It's this culture that makes us see the problems of the others as something distant. And it's not only about marriage… it's about how hard it is to be a kid, how hard it is to be a teenager, how hard it is to be young in a society where you must fit in if you want to survive. The cost is that sometimes you must distance yourself from your family, you need to... ...find your own space and it’s very complicated. That's why when an activist or someone carries this as a political flag, I get very angry, because it's like playing with those lives that have already been lost… I wouldn't be able to sit with a congressman or a senator, and shake his hand. Because I know that to them we are nothing. So, it's very complicated. Along the way, we've found allies, and we realize that not all is lost. That's why I’ll never forget what you told me, one day you told me… I remember perfectly… you told me: These people think that we are nothing, beauticians that don't know anybody... they think they can do with us whatever they want... they saw us small and defenseless. But they never thought that we had good friends. But let me tell you something. When we spoke with the mayor, and each one of us told him what was on our mind, I told him… I can't remember the exact words… You were in front of him, just before we said good bye. Just before we said goodbye, I told him something like: He never thought that two normal, ordinary citizens… Exactly… That's what I was trying to say… - Could achieve what we achieved… - That's what I was trying to say… I tried to tell him, he couldn't let his guard down. Because any citizen can stand up for his/her rights, like we did.
