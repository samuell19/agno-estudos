Yes, but no one will know you're the next Beyoncé... - Or Misty Copeland. - Either way, no one will know anything if you only dance in your house - for your little sister. - Skylar! Thank you. Another reason I can't try out. I'll pick her up after school. Done! Aunt Fredge is here. Aunt Fredge is ready. Aunt Fredge is... dancing! Oh, okay. Okay! I doubt I'll even make it, though. Okay, I think what you're trying to do is this. You know there's only one open spot, right? Oh, um, well, it's an honor to just write my name on the list. - She's been practicing. - I saw. Can't wait to see more at tryouts. - Hmm. - Come on. Well, um, now I am definitely not trying out. Did you just hear how she said, "I saw"? "I saw." "Okay." Okay, every time I've seen you perform, you know what I'm thinking? "That girl is the happiest girl in the world." But I haven't performed in, like, a year. And you saw what just happened. I... I froze. It'll pass. I promise. I am fashion. You are dance. It's just how this world works. But I don't have my lucky shoes for auditions. And I don't have anything to wear. Look who you're talking to. I'd say good luck, but we all know you never wish a dancer good luck.

We've talked it over, and we're excited to offer the spot to... Mia Brooks. So? I made the team. Yes! Yes, yes! Okay, you need to work on your happy face. It looks a little too much like your disappointed face. Well, Liberty said that they sometimes do morning and evening rehearsals. - Mm-hmm. - Like, rehearsals at night. And my mom is working non-stop, and so I kind of have to stay around for Sky. Fam comes first, I hear you, but you have been at home all day every day for the last year. You have to get out at some point. Mia time awaits! See what I did there? I used your name as a play on "me time." Yes, Fredge, I see. - Okay. - Yes! I'll talk to my mom tonight. Um, but I got to go. It's... it's pizza Friday. Oh, you're right. Pizza Friday! That's the it's time for dinner dribble. Now, your turn. Where's the ranch? - Skylar! - You're the one who left an open bottle of dressing on the table. - Go grab some paper towels. - What can't you? Fine. I guess I'll just do everything around here, then. Don't be so dramatic. You made us pizza from a box. How about saying thank you for that delicious pizza from a box? Can you just stop that for one second? Stop telling me what to do. I'm later than late, I know. How was everyone's day? Uh-oh. What did I miss? We're excited... to offer the spot to... ...Mia Brooks. I know there have been some changes around here recently, but we have never and will never slam doors in this house, you hear me? - Hey. - Yes. - I'm sorry. - Mom! - Mom! - Just a minute. Okay. This is the part where you tell me what's going on. Um, I made the dance team. I didn't even know you tried out! Why didn't you tell me? Maybe because it costs, like, $200. - Oh. - And by 200, I mean 800. - Oh, my God. - Mom! I said, just a minute. Mia, you know if we could afford it... Yes, I know. I'm sorry, I don't even know why I said anything. I'm sorry, Mia. It won't always be like this, okay? I promise. Um, well, can I spend the night at Fredgy's? Sometimes she makes me entertain her while she cleans her room. Is it wrong to charge $800 for that? That's fine. You just be back here first thing in the morning, - okay, young lady? - Mom! I'm coming! I am coming. Oh, gosh. Yes, child. I'm going now. I don't see how you're going to do that there. You told your mom about the dance team and she kicked you out. I've always dreamt of you moving in here, but not under these circumstances. Ha-ha. I mean, you said I should get out of my house more, so could I stay in at yours?

Is that the same girl who walked out of the kitchen last night? I am just listening to a good song. - What song is it? - Mom! What? Can't a mother ask her daughter a simple question? - You're killing my vibe. - Hey, now. You remember what I said about us being a team? You, me, Sky... we talk, share, connect. Huh? Huh? Tell that to Alex Morgan over there. Skylar Brooks! All right, now, Miss Sass. I still know something's going on here, but considering I have to work an afternoon shift later today, I need you to go shop for house supplies before I leave you here with Sky. Responsible is one of my favorite colors on you. Really brings out your eyes, girl. Mm-hmm. Have fun.

Their music is, like, permanently stuck in my brain. What? Nothing, just witnessing the rebirth of a star. Tell that to my mom. I hate lying to her, but I just don't think she'd love the idea of me dancing with a street crew. Well, I'm obsessed with the idea. And if Mother wasn't making me do homework later, you know I'd be there obnoxiously screaming - from the sidelines. - Oh, I know.

Wow, I think I've seen Alexis Rubio post about DSA. Yeah, she's one of our stars. We saw one of her videos a few years ago, and now she's in practically every music video - and TV show out there. - Yeah. Wow, that... it's so cool. But tell me more about you. Your technique is impressive. What else is there? What else? I mean, what's the feeling behind it? Why do you dance? Who is Mia? Um, I don't... I don't know. I'm... Next time I see you? Know. Nobody can represent you if you don't know who you are. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that? Nothing. But you two know each other? She knows I have an eye for talent, so she likes to stop by. I should seriously start charging commission. Speaking of money, this belongs to you. - Oh, yeah! - Oh, you fancy, huh? We should keep in touch. I'll let you know where we're setting up next time if you want to roll through. Yeah, for sure. Here. Does this mean you're, like, for real dancing again? Yeah. Yes, it does. Mia.

But I said no to dancing in traffic. I thought you would have been proud. They asked you to dance in traffic? No. Kind of. I just... I didn't mean to scare you. No, you just meant to give me a heart attack. I just thought I could make some money to help out. Possibly start dance classes again. Mia, I love that you wanted to help. I do. But not when it puts you in a dangerous situation. The dance crew is done. I knew you would say that. Why do I think none of this would be happening if your father was here? Wow. I did not know you would say that. I'm sorry, Mia. This is new territory for me. But I'll tell you this, you are grounded. You have home and school, that's it. For how long? Until I say you're not. Hey, Sky, can I have the room for a sec? Can't you see I'm working here? You're still alive! Are you good? Good and grounded. Um, where are you guys? Downtown, bruh. This is where we rehearse. You should seriously roll through sometime. I'm kind of grounded for forever, so I'm done with dance. For real this time. Cool. I'll tell that to secret agent lady - the next time I see her. - No, I mean, I... I want to dance with you guys again and I want Claire to see me, but it's kind of hard to do when you're stuck in the middle of a 9-year-old's soccer game. 9 and a quarter. - Goal! - Oh, my gosh. - See? - All I see is a way for you to be seen without literally being seen, and you're holding it in your hand. Your phone. Social media. Okay, I like to see what people are posting, but posting stuff about myself isn't really my thing, um, because people see it. Exactly. People like Claire. I know so many dancers who have been discovered online. Yeah, Claire actually said she found Alexis Rubio online. Real talk. You're a dope dancer, but it sounds to me like you're always looking for an excuse not to dance. I have something to tell you. Tea party? Spill. I downloaded DANCEical last night.

I mean, my dad, he actually bought me high-tops when I started middle school, and I used to draw these little dance pictures on them. Oh, uh, I don't wear them anymore since he, um... Question. - Okay. - Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck? On horse-sized duck, duh. Okay, okay. Next question. Would you rather live one life that lasts 1,000 years or ten lives that last 100 years each? You know, when my mom finds out that I'm here instead of at home, I think I won't really have any lives to live. Explain this to me. You're a dope dancer. I see it, secret agent lady sees it, and now thousands of people online see it. So what's holding you back? Um... lately, um, I've been stuck in this fantasy that I'm dancing all the time. And sometimes I'm performing in front of my family and my dad is there watching. It's all I want. But he... Yeah, I don't know. I just really haven't been able to dance over the last year, like, really dance, since... ...since he died. Uh, I'm so sorry. I got you. Reality calls. Everything good? I think secret agent lady just got me an audition. Mom, I got an audition at an agency. Can you drive me? Mom, have I ever told you how much I love you? Mia! I want the truth. Did I have to pick up Sky at Fredgy's because you were staying late at school to work on a science project or because you were downtown with those street dancers? I don't even know who you are anymore. Even where you are! I'm always in my room because you grounded me. You don't get to yell at me, young lady. Then why do you get to yell at me? Sky, just stop with the ball. What can't you just kick it back? Dad always did. Couldn't you have just kicked it back to her? We're a team, remember? You're always talking about a team. But a team doesn't leave a player behind. What are you talking about? How do you think it feels when I say bye to you before going to Fredgy's and you don't even look up? Or when I'm sitting outside after school waiting for you not knowing if you're actually going to be there or not? Dad died, so he has an excuse not to show up anymore. What's yours? Mom! - I should... - I know. So after I dance, it's just like, "You're in"? - Or... - "You're out! See you never. Bye!" Don't make me more nervous than I already am. No agent, no dance career. The end. Stand up. Now say, "I am powerful." Great. I'm literally sandwiched between a human motivational poster and a literal motivational poster. Say it. I am powerful. Oh. Wait. What's that? You need Mia? Oh, hey, your confidence is calling. - Stop. - Can't stop, won't stop. Now, repeat after me. "I am strong!" - I am strong! - Yes! Whoo! Well, hey, thank you so much for coming in. - Thank you so much. - We'll be in touch. Mia Brooks? You're great. Now walk in it. Glad you made it. The other agents are excited to meet you. So, I know you and I have met before, but why don't you tell all of us a little bit about yourself? - Who is Mia? - Um... well, I'm Mia, but I gue...
