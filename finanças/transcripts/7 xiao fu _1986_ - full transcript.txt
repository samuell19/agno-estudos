I'll be late! My detective, let me have a good time, okay? Hurry up or it'll be late! But your parents instructed me to protect you before they left. I'll be safer without you. Hurry, or I'll jump! Yes Sir! Wait, what are you doing, detective? It's already embarrassing enough, you just wait in the car. Yes Sir. The Seven Lucky Kids are the toughest! Get back in there and don't follow me. Yes sir! Right turn! Hey, Rocky, what do they call you in the states? Rambo. Huh, Ramba? No, no, it's Rambao! Your English is pretty good, Rocky. I can't stand him speaking English. Judy is really disgusting, she even has a westerner's name too. Shut it! Attention! Attention! I am your squad leader. Call me Rocky. In the states | am Rambo. What are you all laughing at? Showing some teeth? Judy! Yes sir! Fatty! Yes! Bragger! Yes! Dumb Dumb! Dumb Dumb! Sir, it's Dummy, not Dumb Dumb! Dummy! Yes! Two-Tooth! What's up? Yes! Hsiao Mao! Yes, yes.

Come up with something else next time. You're fat and still eating. Do you know how you're going to die? From obesity! So what, | won't be that fat! Where're we going for lunch? Ladies first. It's all the same to me. Disgusting! It's not disgusting enough! | prefer the vendors. Cheap and tasty! You go there yourself! | suggest we go to a restaurant. Do you really mean it?! Yes. Thanks. Excuse me. What would you like, sir? Ladies first. Anything will do. You, sir? | know what he wants. How would you know? I can tell, you only want pretty girls. Judy, let's have a steak, okay? Okay. Two steaks. Yes. And you, sir? Me? I'd like two-steaks too. You're having two steaks for yourself? Two-steak means two steaks, dummy. I can't order one for Hsiao Mao? Just ask him. Yes, yes. | guess, steaks for everyone. | also want a stewed egg. Sorry, but we don't serve stewed eggs. How do you like your steak? How do | like the steak? I like all steak. Medium. Yes, sir. You want a medium?! Don't make fools out of yourselves. I guess we will all have medium. Yes, sir. Did you bring it? Is the money here? I'd like to take a look first. I'd like to see the money first.

You... Pardon me. Wait. Look under the table. Strange, we always have stewed beef. How come it's fried? Hey, Dummy, do you know how to eat a steak? You think you're the only one? Fatty, show him how it's done. Easy, it's like eating a hamburger. Take a bread and put the steak in it. -My bad. -Crazy man. Hey, bring the money here. Don't get me wrong, it was an accident. You crazy man, you're insane! My steak, look... You again? | told you not to come! Don't get me wrong, it's not my fault! It was an accident! I'll beat you! The Seven Lucky Kids are advancing! Jeez, what a bunch of lunatics! I couldn't even eat my steak. Man, grownups told us not to fight and they're fighting? Yup, old people fighting all day long. Listen up, those thugs had guns! Girls are always nosy. Shut up! Judy, we shouldn't involve ourselves. In the states, thugs are always using firearms. You're all nothing but a bunch of cowards! Yes, yes. We're all cowards here with a tomboy. It's all your fault! I just happened to pass by. It's not my fault, miss. Just get lost! Yes, Sir! Left turn! Bye-bye! Jeez. Acting like you're the boss around here. Simpleton. You... You didn't finish the job, and you have balls to show your face? I'll take the punishment. No complaints about it. Absolutely none. No complaints, huh? Dummy, Simpleton. Brother? What are you guys doing? Cut his stomach. I'll do whatever you say. Tough guys. Take the gun and sword and clean them. Yes sir. Alright, I'll give you another chance. Bring the diamond here, do whatever it takes! Sir! I'm their target. Take the diamond. We'll meet up in the same place. I'll be wearing a flower. Okay. Hurry. Did you touch my butt? You're mistaken, this is all fair. Fair? Then this is all fair! Was | wrong again? Let me see that, Dummy. Take it. It's no fun, have it back. You little devil! Why did you hit me, you crazy? Dummy, what are you thinking about? Your family? Jeez, awomen just slap me for no reason. How come? I don't know. My grandpa says all women are troublemakers. Hey, Dummy, look! The thugs are over there! -Where? -There! Let's go take a look. Come on! Over there, Dummy! It was him. Hold on, it's not my fault. Wait. Are you crazy! Great! Dummy, you go over there and I'll go over there. Uncle, does it hurt, does it hurt? Miss, please take this to Chiang Helen. Who's Chiang Helen? A women with a flower on her chest. Where is she? She is... Sheis... He's dead! Kid! Stop sleeping, stop sleeping! For what? A man died in there! Really? Where? Just come follow me and you'll see. Come on. Right here. -He's gone? -Who's dead? He was here. I'm not lying to you. He could be upstairs. Are you making fun of me? Get out... You're still young and just messing with me. You're adumb man, you dummy. You only know how to play cards a sleep. You don't even know a man just died. Come on! Go! There! Hey, over here! -Where? -This way! Haven't you seen a women before? What, making a pass on me? Looking at me? Come on! Let's go. It's them. It's over, Dummy! Where? Let's go, Judy! This way! Dummy, split up! Shame on you, pervert! My bad, I didn't mean to. My bad, I didn't mean to. Come on, come on! I'm a model. The American leader is Reagen. The Libyan leader is Gaddafi. Gaddafi made fun of Reagen, so Reagen sent carriers to bombard him. Gaddafi is accusing him of murder. Mothering. Traffic has been bad since the subway began. Especially on Sundays and holidays. There are also troublemakers too. Of course, we're nothing like that. To fulfill our duties, don't worry, | have always been... Worthless. -Worthless. -Where? | shot one down. No, two shots. Have you seen the kung fu kids? They're really tough. Nowadays, there are some tough kids, the Seven Lucky Kids. They know a variety of martial arts, like the "running away". Is it true? Then you should be more careful. However, | still managed to encounter them. Because | didn't have the luck is why | lost them. And the diamond?! They got away with the diamond. You really are good for nothing! I've given you two chances and you still don't have the diamond! Just what are you doing?! Killing time. It's not that simple! -Dummy, Simpleton, -Yes sir. I'll also going! He's also going. That man, before he died, gave me a diamond. Is it true, Dummy? 1 didn't see it. I know you're lying for making us wait. We've been waiting for a while. They still want to hear more, Fatty. Yes, yes. The thugs then chased Dummy and I, it was thrilling. I ran so fast. I wouldn't be here is it wasn't for him. No way it's all true. -That's right. -Judy, Is this diamond for real? Because the way it looks looks real. Stupid boys! Stupid! Who's that?! What do you want?! -I don't know. -Stupid guys! Try again. What are you knocking for, crazy men?! Tomboy. Tomboy! He's calling me names. -Does it matter? -Brother came with us. You ask for everything. -Simpleton, -Yes. -Just do what | do. -Yes! Hold it, all of you! Give me the diamond! Simpleton, don't do it! I'll do what he does! Those thugs came here for the diamond. This could be true. Strange. What is this, trying to hold a man? Shame on you. Thanks for helping me. | sent you guys up there, where were you heading? We always try to get the job done as soon as possible. We just finished. And the diamond? We were a little too fast, we didn't see anyone. They must still have it. Thanks. And | still have to be there myself! And he still has to be there himself. -Is this the one? -It's the one. They're here! Hold on to this tightly. Our brother is more smart. Shut up! What's the brother for? They asked for trouble themselves. Yeah, make them eat it. You two hold on tight. Dummy! What were they doing? Who cares about what they're doing, Let's go skating. Let's go skating! Strange, they got in and went out there. They gotin and now they're gone. Where are they? I've never seen this before. I'm checking this out. Strange. | never saw you leave, so how did you get in? Where's the kids? Skating... err... I don't know. Find them. -Now it's my turn. -Hands up. Nothing, brother. Did you steal it? Steal what? -Dummy, -Yes! Tell him. Don't touch me, don't touch me! I'll tell you everything! Please. Look, Fatty. What for? Over there, Judy is acting silly. No wonder the thugs chased after her. I'm going to make fun of her. Be nice if you can't do it yourself, Fatty. Are you alright, Fatty? I'm alright, it was nothing. No taste. And you're a silly girl skating like you're dancing. Why? | like it. No wonder the thugs chased you. It's none of your business. Don't worry, it'll be alright. They should be dead jumping from the twelfth floor. Rocky knows me best. -Disgusting! -Hey, Judy. What's up with the diamond? That man wanted me to give it to awomen with a flower on her chest. Her name is Chiang Helen, | have to give it to her. Where is she? ...I don't know yet. -I knew it! -All lies! Fatty! Simpleton! Yes! Speaking of the devil, here he is. Hey, you're not dead? It's not that easy? It's strange that you're still skating here. Yeah... ska... you're... still skating here. You should be in the army. We wanted to. -Where's the diamond? -l don't know. -Get them! -Yes Sir! Dummy, Dummy! What? Those thugs are here! -What are you doing? -Skating. Get them! Over there! Look! Strike! What did you hit me for? Why are we laughing? We should do something. They can't even stand. Are you afraid of them? Okay, the winner is the first one and the loser is the last one. Stop playing around. Hey, let's play football. Brother, | don't want to be a soldier. All finished! You should say, they're all finished, you dumb-head. Brother, brother... ...you can be the soldier now. Idiot! Why not sooner? -Brother, how can | become a soldier now? -Try to do it yourself. Damn! Shame on you for bringing those. Why? Show your weapons! We don't want to show them it. What are you guys thinking about? Stupid! All defeated! All in one stroke! Simpleton! I don't want to be a soldier! Idiots! Damn! Damn them. Damn! Hey, damn them! Damn! Damn! Damn!!! There he is again. What? Where are they? No, it's that swordsman. Judy, that diamond has brought us nothing but trouble. We should sell it so we have some money. -Yes, yes. -No way, we have to give it to Chiang Helen. There is so many women, where would we find her? A women wearing a flower on her chest. That's right. We could split up and go our separate ways. Look! -The American girl is pretty. -Fatty, she's wearing a flower. Hey, Dummy, ask her. I only know A, B, and C. How can | ask her? Rocky, ask her since you know English. Hi. What's your name? Helen. Helen is her name. Ask her her surname. What's your father's name? John. | see. John is Chiang. Hey, ask if she has a mole on her leg. May I... May I... -Just shut up if you can't say it! -Can't you say it? -It's really embarrassing. -It's so easy. What do you want? She can speak Chinese? | should have known it. Shame on you, pervert! That's him. -What? Little bastard! -Hey, his father is over there. How come your son is such a shameless kid? Why are you laughing? Didn't you see your son making a pass on her? You're mistaken, it's not my fault. Then tell me who is to blame! Of course. It's the parent's fault. Why are you laughing?

When we encounter one, stay calm and don't panic. How do we spot a pervert? Good, I'm well experienced to tell you. They're always in the same clothes. They all wear a cloak because they don't want to face people. They also wear a pair of dark glasses and a hat, and have a distinctive scent on their body. It smells like nasty water. Show yourself! Speaking of the devil himself. Don't panic. Just watch how | handle this First, we have to set a firm posture. Talk as if you were angry.
