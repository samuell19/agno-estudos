Yugoslavia, May 1942 Where is the commander? - In position! Comrade Commander. I report at your command. Just in time. I have good news for you, Comrade Major. Following the decision of the Supreme Commander, Comrade Tito, you are appointed for partisan squadron commander. For what? Commander of Partisan Aviation. I hear for the first time that we have aviation. Because we don't have. We need to create it. Our party-organizations are already active on the enemy airports. Even illegals lose no time. They will sent us airplanes. - How many planes? Just one airplane with red star for our fighters will mean more then hundreds of Messerschmitts and Stukas for the Germans. Comrade Lieutenant. At your command, Comrade Commander. - Lieutenant lsmet Begovic. Your new partner. Operating Officer of the squadron. Comrade Commander! Medical officer is looking for you. Okay, you two can agree now. You are still wearing a pilot's badge? - It's a memory for me. -For Spain? How do you know? - Red squadron Gloriosa. Seven victories in the air, two times defeated. You are informed well. - I love when someone tells me that. Comrade Major. Will we soon return to the unit? Maybe we'll never come back. We are going to aviation. Where?! - Give some water to horses, Dalibor. The airport we already have. Milica Gaj. But that is meadow. -Yes, but not the bad place. It's hidden. I do not know how we will succeed. - You know! You'll manage somehow. You're a pilot. -Above all, I am a soldier, comrade commander. I'm thinking what we have and what we need. We need everything. - And we have nothing. Neither bombs nor fuel or ammunition. You know what this is? Gasser, revolver, Model 1896th With this gun I went into the fight. Still have questions? No, comrade commander. - Then I'll ask one. Actually, this is a question for all of us set by our supreme commander, Comrade Tito. Can we chase away the enemy from the land, but also from the sky? We can not, comrade commander. - Then our goal is clear. We must become masters of our skies. Partisan squadron Scenario The main roles Grandpa, our pilots have arrived. - I know, girl. I've seen. Where are you going? I go by to say hello. Beware of these pilots, child. They are not like others. They are always on the sky. They don't have homes, nor graves. They are so beautiful, grandpa. Comrade Major. We are reporting to duty in the partisan squadron. Reporting the pilot Slaven Ledic. Mechanic and shooter, Milan Stonjic? Pilot, Zlatko Kovacic. Tomislav Uzelac, shooter. Comrades! Welcome to the partisan squadron. You have the honor to be first on the sky with our red star. Long live the first pilots of our revolution. I could not resist. Free. Hello! Hello. How are you? -Do you still remember me, Comrade Major? I never forget my best students. Are you still writing songs, Slaven? - It was a long time ago, Comrade Major. Yes, this was in '33. - '35. I forget the years easily. Girl! Down with the legs from the wing! If you're so careless, you'll break the neck. What are you doing here? - I brought gifts. Do not, girl. What will you give to you boyfriend then? I don't have a boyfriend. Are you a pilot? I'm not. And those over there? Why is this important? For the first time I see the pilot. What do you have to see?. He did not fall from the sky. The man, like everyone else. How many of them ... They are flying from Kozara. What are you doing, man? Tool in the hands and go to work! Hi, Vuk. -Hi. - What are you doing? My Hornets were taken to patching. Think about it, our pilots pierced his tail. What our pilots? Why do you speak with we this way? You think I'm provocateur? Are you? I got the idea. Also, I got it. Take there. Slowly. Shuld I steal this machine? - Don't speak nonsense, what's wrong with you. And then we run in the forest, and join the partisans. And then to kick some German asses. Good idea, right? Yes, except for one little thing. The aircraft does not operate without a pilot. You're right. Then stop thinking. However, if for example ... ... you are piloting? First I have to finish school for pilots. You have already finished. On the eve of war, I saw you at the airport of Zemun. You flew in the hunter. Did you tell someone about that? - No, I did not. Let it stay so. What is it, Deko? - These are ours. This is partisan aviation. Take cover, quick! Lord Commander. Are they English? Nonsense! They are partisans, damn. From where did they get airplanes? The shooter, what's wrong? - Legs ... You will be able? - I will. Well done. What did he say? He says let them fly, we will get them soon. Leave the aircraft! Leave the aircraft, what are you waiting for? Here they are! What is it? - Legs. Bring a stretcher. Slowly. We did a good job. Yes, my friend. You're the best shooter. We started well, Comrade Major. I'm sorry, because ... ... because I'm leaving. You will return to us soon. It's over with the legs. - You will survive, Milan. I don't care. I'll never fly again. Heil Hitler! -Heil Hitler. Welcome, Mr. Major (SS). Ludwig Kauberg, Gestapo. He will be leading officer here. The same as now. -It's not, Vuk. This one is more toxic than the cobra. Wherever he appears, gravediggers are working in three shifts. How are you so well-informed? - I know to stretch my ears. Is that all? Come in. Lord Lieutenant, Mr Major Klauberg. Heil Hitler. Major Klauberg, Gestapo. By order of the commander of the SS I have the task to explore incident with partisan aviation. Colonel von Norden, commander of the airport. I am familiar with the commands. Please. - Thank you. It looks like you were attacked by Flying Fortress. We were surprised, Mr. Major. Completely unexpected. They flew so low that our defense was completely powerless and could not shoot. However, we are now ready. They will be destroyed as soon as they appear. They will not appear when you expect them. In addition, we are not waiting, we attack first. We will destroy them in the home nest. First, we have to find them. And that is not exactly easy. If it was easy, now I would not be here, sir Colonel. Now will come reinforcements. Now it will not be easy to escape. We should do it, but you did not want to listen. Why don't you find someone else? - I trust only you. Would you like to do me a favor? - Just tell me. Leave me alone! Our soldiers should not lose faith in our superiority. A toast! To win. Lord Lieutenant, a very important message. -Thanks You were right, Mr. Major. Partisans, you know, bandits, have a really big plans. - What happened? Before an hour, an airplane was stolen from Italian airport "Delta". Light the torches. Comrade Major! Pilot, lieutenant Zarko Cerovic reporting for duty in a partisan squadron. My ex colonnello is sending you an aircraft on loan. Are you that Zarko who flew in '39 under the Mostar bridge? - Flew and flew. And you lost your rank. - But I won the bet. I barely passes under. Like you in '35. So. - So, Comrade Major. And this Madonna? - Do you know her personally? I didn't have that honor. - Then, let her be gone before morning. Welcome. Landscape partisan detachment encountered an enemy ambush. We must help them. We must take off immediately. I understand. -Comrade Major, I don't have shooter. You will have. Dalibor. Yes, Comrade Major?. - Take your flight suit. Who, me? - Of course. Who else? I ... Simo. - What? Take care of my horse. - I will. Oh, leave me. I dropped all the cherries, Dalibor. Are you crazy? Yes, I'm crazy! I'm preparing for the aviation. - Do not lie! But I do not lie. Major ordered me ... ... to fly as a shooter. - You are not scared? -Me? Be careful with the bombs. Ivan! Hurry up! Be careful with the safety fuse. Enough. You will overburdening your aircraft. Get away with that. Too bad they are small caliber. - What do you want, to build them from seage pipes? You've built them well. Here's our guy. Simo, I'm going up. - Good luck. Comrade lieutenant. Marksman on board, Dalibor Pavic is ready for liftoff. - Well, climb up already. Behave like you are in the saddle. You will ride 400 horses at the same time. And you, what are you doing here? I came to escort him. He says that this is for good luck. Okay then, if this is for good luck, give him a quick kiss. Dalibor, good luck. You are not afraid? - Shuld I be? Ah, I forgot. You're an old flier. You are always high. Fire! - Fire! Take cover! We must escape from here. They will kill us like rabbits. Let the fighters prepare for the attack. German Tigers. I didn't think it could get worse. Damn! They are shooting on their own! Lower, lower! Stop! Forward, follow me! Fight, cowards! Comrade Commander. Are that our airplanes? You see they are. They are our! Our! Red star! Look how big it is. Call the headquarters. Here is VOST-3. Two enemy aircrafts. LAV-3B, the direction is 180. I repeat ... VOST-7 Two enemy planes ... We are near the nest. See? Prepare aircrafts. - I understand! Prepare a group of one and two. There is something wrong. I have barely landed. I will see what I can do. How was it? Comrade Major. Message from the Chief of Staff. This is the first message that you received? -First. Let's see if you have a lucky hand. - It seems, no. You really aren't. - What happened? Pack the radio station. The Germans found us. We will move to the new airport, Beden field. Listen. Tell Zare and Dalibor to immediately take off and prepare necessary for our arrival. What is wrong with Slavens plane? It's still repairing. You were lucky, shot in the engine. They landed in this area. Valdmann! Major! Now you can show us your talent for topography. Is there any place in this area which leaves open possibility for the airport? Yes, there is. -Where? Here. In Milica Gaj. Dalibor, look. Get ready, rider. Attention, Attention to all Eagles. Left, below. Hostile aircraft! Destroy him! Zare, hunters. Zare, I hit him. Zare! I'm out of ammunition. The radio station ... - Jelena, where are you going? Stop! Hold this! Wait here. To all eagles. Bravo! Return to the outpost. Fighters of the partisan squadron, Assembly! Grandpa. I would like to go with them. I asked the mayor, he said I can go if you let me. Will you? What can I say? I do not know, Grandpa. I will do as you say. Does this mill power water? - No, Grandpa. Water powers mill. It is like that from the beginning. Old mill is spinning in place, the water has it's own way. Thanks, Grandpa. Take care, girl. Go. - Goodbye, Grandpa. Lord Lieutenant, You can tell the main headquarters: There is no more partisan aviation. Very good. Congratulations. Glorious success. Excellent. And how was it? - Routine work. The view is excellent. - Yes, you are right. I was flying above that area. I'm ready to fight. I don't want anything else. However, I am not a Communist. On our side there are not fighting only the Communists. All true patriots are with us. Rather tell me, how do we get to the airplane? The aircraft near hangar 8. Ready for test flight. He is yours. And pilots on duty? They will shoot me. -They will not be able to fly. Our man from the accumulator station will plant empty batteries. Attention! Latest News. The main headquarters for the Southeast is reporting: that the so-called Partisan Air Forces are finally destroyed. There's my plane. Our plane, Vuk ... yours and mine. Mr Commander! Yes? Lieutenant Valdmann is looking for you. What does he want? I do not know, ask him. He is in the hangar. Okay. Yes! Yes ... OK! Damn! My plane! Eagle, who drives that plane? You don't hear me, fools? Eagle! Eagle! Are you deaf? Eagle! Alarm! Nothing! - Sabotage. Alarm, quick! Turn on the battery. What's wrong? It Doesn't not work! Battery is empty. What's happening? They stole an aircraft. Shit! Let's get outta here. Have we enough ammunition? - We have, why do you ask? Vuk, what are you doing? Are you crazy? I have! -Don't be a fool. You know the commands. We have to take care of the plane! - Just enjoy it. This is ours. - Eagle, present yourself! Eagle, present yourself. From which unit are you? Eagle, Eagle. What is your mission? Please respond! Respond! - Greetings from Vuk Aleksic. He is on fire! You hit him, Vuk! Another round, okay? - Okay! Destroy them, Vuk! Green rocket. They are our. We are landing, pal. Landing gear is damaged. He didn't notice! Shoot the red rocket. Red Rocket. Don't land! What is wrong? - Wheel is jammed. I can not free him. Damn good. Who is this fool? -Whoever he is, he got balls. You did this very good. Like on the air rally. There is no way to release the wheel. We are going to land, we will see what will happen. Just Fly! Vuk knows what is discipline. He would not disregard the order. But German aircrafts were so nice in front of us ... So, you are saying that before the war, he served in Zemun airport? Even in times of war, Comrade Major. He defended Belgrade from the Stuka in '41. He Took off three times and three times they hit him. Unbelievable! - He would took off fourth time but ran out of airplanes. Where did he go after? He wanted to continue fighting. However, he went home first, to say goodbye. He had a house in Senjak. And? What happened? Direct hit, Comrade Major. Father ... Wife ... Daughters ... Two daughters ... They all died. Okay, Zeko. You can go. Repair the aircraft as soon as possible. I understand, Comrade Major. We will repair it. What will you do? Will you punish him? I have to. He was told not to go into action. We could lose an aircraft. In that situation, I do not know if any of us would do otherwise. We all sometimes a bit on our own hand. - It would be easy if he is like that. I would punish him disciplinary and period. -So what's the problem? The problem is in him. Family was killed, he survived ... a bird is defending its nest until death. Vuk Aleksic is not responsible for the death of the family. -No, no. But he thinks he is guilty and he would like to repent. He will not spare himself and the airplanes. Until he is liek that, I will not let him fly. Come on ... Slowly ... Watch the wing ... Right away, right ... Good, good! Stop. Stop! Hello. - Hello. The plane is ready for action. Excellent! - It's shining as for the parade. Everything is fine. The engine was tested. -Thanks, Zeko. When will you return me my airplane? I do not know, Vuk. This is decided by Major. Then I will ask Major. - I'd rather wait a bit. I will not wait anymore. - Have patience, Vuk. I recommend you that. I'm going to speak with Major. Do not be so hard, Vuk. No, it is not wise. Would you like to do me a favor? - Sure. Leave me alone! The task performed without loss. Add: Suplies of fuel are at end. Code that. What's up, Vuk. - Comrade Major, I want to fly. Have patience, you'll fly. More ... - When? After the war? Do you think the war will end so quickly? I do not know. I can not wait any longer. Comrade Lieutenant. You should know that we have a total of two aircrafts. And each of them worth thousands of lives. And more than that ... Once you realized that, I'll let you fly. You can go. How will you know? -What? - That the Vuk changed? He will told me himself. And if he will not change? Then he will no longer fly. Is that your final decision. - This is the only right decision. Should always be all fair? There should be no exceptions? There are no exceptions when the fate of the squadron is under question. Repeat the procedure for landing. So. Slow down to speed ... - How much? Fully throttle ... And? And I look at the floor. And beware that you don't kiss it. Tell me exactly where to look at. - Watching ... Where? - In front. 30 meters ... And a little to the left ... Push the lever toward you, quickly ... -No. Not so. Do not break the iron. With feelings, gently, like you touch a woman Nice stuff you teach. What is that in basket? - I've gathered mushrooms for dinner. If you poison the squadron, you will receive a medal from Hitler. Do not worry. I know the mushrooms better than Dalibor airplanes. So ... Tell her, am I for the pilot? - Born flyer. Like he was breastfed with bird milk. - I know that he drank goat milk. Watch the airplane not be hopping rather than flying. Has a sharp tongue. -What then, You are not innocent either. It's time to fly. And remember. Maintain speed. Speed holds you in the air. Without it, you're dead. Comrade Major. Group of pilots reporting for duty in a partisan squadron. Leader, reserve bomber pilot, Boris Kosjer. Comrades flyers! Death to fascism! Freedom to the people! Who allowed Zare to fly? - I do not know. See our red star! Zare. Zare. Zeko, Zeko. Zeko, check the engine. Comrade Major, I have worked all alone. And landed. Zar let me all. Good Dalibor. The first landing was good. Congratulations! Only one round, only five liters are gone. Only five weeks of no-fly, Comrade Lieutenant. Free. I understand, Comrade Major. Open warehouse! Don't cry anymore, Dalibor. Now you've got ammunition, as much as you want. Where did you get it? - Proletarians captured it. Comrade Major, that was sent from Chief of Staff. Germans are moving in this area. Their movements should be carefully reviewed. - What do you think? Are they preparing a new offensive? - I do not know. It seems they will try to reach Bihac. When is starting a session of AVNOJ? - In five days. So, that bone is in their throat. Zare! Here. How do you look? -What 's wrong? - Where's your hat? I think it is in the bedroom. - Go get her. okay. - Wait. First, you have a task. - I? But Comrade Major ... - In reconing. You will give a report to the officer immediately upon completion of the assignment. Lieutenant Begovic will give you all further instructions. But Comrade Major, I can not fly! You punished me. In honor of our first session of Parliament in Bihac, you are free from punishment. Complete your task. I understand! Accurate like the sun. Hello, comrades. - Hello. Capt. Normovic? - That's me. Everything is recorded. The power of the forces, direction, movement and time of inspection. Thank you, Comrade Lieutenant. Need something? Gasoline, Comrade Captain. Send it as soon as possible. Good luck! - Hi. Shall we greet them? We were hit. Hang on, Dalibor. Dalibor, are you all right? - Yes. -Good. Tell me, Vuk. Are the alive? I do not know the girl. Even for those stars I'm not sure whether they are alive and I see them. The are shiny but maybe they already went out. - I'm not interested in stars right now. And who interest you then? Dalibor? Yes. That's OK. As long as you think of him, he's alive. Miljo. It is late already. Go to sleep. Why did you make her cry? She is no longer a child. She began to lose. No one is waiting for us, as Dalibor. Die or not, who cares ... No one gains and nobody loses. -You're wrong, Vuk. However, someone loses. - Who? Our deceased. Leave already dead alone! Think for your life. What do we do with the plane? When look at it, I would say old junk. But no! I know his soul. Him I can trust as the best companion. Even now he did not let us down. I made a mistake myself. I flew too low. So ... Go ahead, I'll handle this. It is better that I do it, I know how you feel. I once had to shoot my horse. I can not remember that it was ever been more difficult to me Give me the machine gun and go. Go, Dalibor. Are there any news? - No one has seen them. Enough for tonight. Go rest yourself. I will stay until they call us. There is no chance for that. Until now, they would have returned if they went all the way to Berlin. As far as I know Zare, it would not be surprised, if they really flew to Berlin. Think about it, to receive the news that Raihstag is bombed. Well, we arrived. Will not be easy. You need to decide. You want to be in the infantry or aviation? Of course in aviation. -Then we can't go back without the airplane. Hey guys, where are you going? Hey! Stop it! I was told to stop! Stop! I was told to stop! Come on! Sit! Watch out, go for the gasoline! - That I want. Stop! Stop, stop! Fools! Do not shoot! Gasoline! Dalibor, we are going up. Door! Shoot into the tank. Zare! Zare, what is it? Let me take care of the wound. - No, leave now this. Dalibor, hands do not obey me. You'll have to. - Fly? No, zare. I do not know. Remember how I taught you. But it's not our plane. I can not. -You have to. I'll help you. Well, show me what you know. That's it. Keep course 180. What now? Maintain the level and enjoy it. How are you feeling? Never better. How are you doing? - Good. Now is good. But what later? How I will land? You will act according to my instructions. Do not worry, you know enough. Gently, like stroking a woman. Look, Medeno field. We arrived. What now? Zare, what should I do now? Turn on the radio station. - I do not know where it is. That switch there. Set the frequency to the 390. Medeno field, respond. Here is Medeno field! Who's calling? Biplane. Biplane is calling. Zare, is that you? No, Dalibor. And not a biplane. Highplane! We are landing. I'm landing Dalibor, pull yourself together! What happened? Where is Zare, you hear me? Where is Zare? Do not answer. Focus on the landing! Major! Come on. Push stick forward. Gas Reduce by half. Watch your speed. She is life. Dalibor, reduce speed. Align plane. Drag a stick. Stick on ... Stick on ... Zare! We did it, Zare. We have landed. Zare ... Zare ... All of you should be shoot! Incompetent! Not for any use! Lieutenant Lampe. Let me hear your report. There were two of them, Mr Major. Saboteurs. Sky commandos. - Nonsense! What sky commandos? Bandits!!! They have destroyed your airport. And stole an airplane in front of the nose. - Bloody assholes! How you doing, Vuk? Fine. Good machine. Without the fuel, dead machine. In our war fuel is more expensive than blood. I'm afraid you're right. - The airplane is more expensive than life. You were right, Major. Still, I would rather prefer a live Zare then this plane. I think this time Zare would not agree with you. Also, not me. Now at least we know about their presence in the area. We searched the entire area. All aircrafts are equipped with photographic devices. There isl more than a thousand square kilometers to record. It is like plowing the sea. If necessary, I will plow the sea. But I will find them! Here ... Comrade Major. This is the plane that was seized. Good, comrade. Thank you for letting us know without delay. He was circulating over the clearing, but we hided. When he landed, we assaulted him. The crew surrended. They said the engine failed. - How's it going, Zeko? Well, Comrade Major. Can it be repaired, Vuk. - Can. It is already finished. Ready for launch. It's working without errors. There is enough fluel so you can immediately fly. Where? To the outpost. -Why would I take you your plane to the outpost? Vuk! Did you hear? Your plane. Go now, comrade Lieutenant. It is not wise to left your plain on open field. I understand, Comrade Major. Climb up! We are going up! Can you hear the purring of your plane? In any case, our airplane, Zeko. Vuk, we have guests. Zeko! We are hit, we have to go down! Zeko, what is it? I'm wounded, Vuk. As soon as possible we need to go from here. Vuk. Like this we will never succeed. Leave me here. Leave me alone. -No, no. Leave me, Vuk. It was good to hang out with you. Really, mate. Now do me a favor. - Tell me Zeko. Leave me here. Did you hear? Leave me alone. Where are we flying? - Home, Zeko. To my house? - Yes, to your house. It's dark. It's night? - It's day. I can not see. - We are flying through the clouds. Vuk! Is that the sun? - Yes. We came out from the cloud. We are flying up... Yes, my comrade. We are flying vertically. Now I see ... ... I see the sky. How clear it is ... Zeko! Do you see the traces near these hays? Yes. They look like traces of wheels. In these images there are no traces. Here they are. So they have been removed. This could be an airfield. Waldmann! Prepare a group of nine aircrafts. - I understand, Major. If they are really there, we will surprise them. Fuel! Fuel is here! Here, comrade Major. Now we have enough fuel. Report of the operation I'll deliever later. -It's okay. Put the fuel into aircrafts and into our tanks. Complete work as quickly as possible to get people off the airport. Girls. Go there to the aircraft. Faster. - Mila, take them to the warehouse. In the forest! Quick, quick! Take! Remove the fuel away from the aircrafts! Take cover! In the forest! Take cover! Remove the airplane in the shelter. - Extinguish the fire. Faster, faster! Here, faster! Dalibor! Mila! Dalibor. Here I am, Mila. Here I am. Just stay ... ... alive. Heil Hitler. Please, gentlemen. I would like immediately go to the matter. Here I have something very interesting. Colonel, have you seen this? No, sir General. And you? No, sir General. Interesting. Gestapo is usually well informed. Before two days radio Free Yugoslavia broadcasted this. Sit. I have a translation. I will read you. Supreme Headquarters urges Yugoslav pilots and mechanics. The fight against fascism is growing. Comrades! We urge you, wherever you are, at home or abroad, contact immediately the first air base NOVJ. Contact via the partisan headquarters or through the Allied headquarters abroad. Death to fascism, freedom to the people. What do you say to that, gentlemen? Communist propaganda, general. I'm not that opinion, Colonel. I have informations that both the Russians, and British, will send combat aircrafts to the partisans. - If it is true, which I doubt, we await ready. If there is more of them, the easier they will be found and destroyed. - Do not talk nonsense! You are destroying them for two years already. And what's the score? Partisans captured our airport. And 12 of our aircrafts fell into their hands. So do not talk about destruction. You were not able to destroy even their own planes. You know that i feel sad because we're leaving. - It's not our first moving, lsmet. But the last one. Partisan squadron is gone, comrade Major. Now this airbase will have dozens of aircraft and with hundreds of pilots. Real aviation. Haven't we always dreamed about it? - We have. And fortunately dream is now reality. But there would be nothing without a partisan squadron. You become sentimental, Comrade Lieutenant. What can I do, Comrade Major. Pilots are spoiling me. Hello! By order of the Supreme Command tomorrow morning at the 5 AM will begin offensive "Autumn storm". The objective of Operation: Restore lost coastal areas. There will also participate three of my divisions. One division will be led by Colonel Schlitten. Shaded areas are controlled by partisans. The aim of the operation: Disable the enemy to move through the mountain Paklenica and move to coastal zone behind our back. The situation at the front is ... - The direction of the German attack is river Studena-meadow Orlovaca- - mountain Paklenica. Our units have a mission to restrict the German penetration as long as the majority of units will not move through the mountain Paklenica to coastal areas. Our fighters will defend positions to the last man. They will defend it only under one condition. German armored and motorized units, that are already moving, must not cross the bridge. Will they manage to cross? It's up to us. We have to destroy the bridge. This is the bridge. Steel construction is 40 meters long. Protected on both sides, with a strong anti-aircraft weapons. It can be destroyed only by direct hit. The attack will be carried out in vertical position with individual bomb dropping. I and the lieutenant Vuk Aleksic will neutralise anti aircraft weapons after the first wave. Are there any questions? After this mission, we are going back to take fuel and then we fly to our first real airbase. What it is, still not ready? In seven minutes, the convoy is leaving. You will left the airport with them. If in my place was another radiooperater, would you send him also? - We will not defend this airport. All equipment that will remain, will be destroyed. I want to save radio station. Not true ... You want to save me. - There is no need for you to stay here. Aircrafts will have to return for the fuel. And as long as aircrafts are landing, radiooperater has to be near radio-station. Is that right? Yes. Then I will stay. If we fail to destroy the bridge, the German tanks will be here before us. It doesn't matter, I will remain. You said before that there are no exceptions. You're right. You will remain with lieutenant Begovic. Bye. - Bye. Jelena! Yes? You are a brave girl. And that's all? Dalibor! Yes, comrade Major? - Why do you look like that? Take it. For your first autonomous flight. But, comrade Major. This is your dearest memory. That's why I give it to you. Seagull 1, calling Meadow. Here is a seagull 1. German tanks are 20 kilometers from the bridge. Again ... German tanks are 20 kilometers from the bridge. - I understand the message. Over and out! - Wait a moment. I have a personal message. Do you accept? I accept. -I just got the good news. Boris Kosjer got a son. Boris, congratulations. - Thank you, Elena. Boris, congratulations. - Congratulations, Boris. Congratulations, Boris. - Thank you! Jelena. And the name? You did not say the name. - The wife says that the name will be your choice. Comrades, you have heard. Squadron, suggest. Give him the name: Slobodan. - Give him the name: Borislav. The best is: Predrag. - Give him a name ... ... Zare. - Boris. Call him Zvezdan. Lord Lieutenant, the bridge is free. All is under our control. Units can easily cross. Very good, Lieutenant. Thank you. Drive! Not to fast. Stop! Partisan airplanes! Back! Quick, quick. Back! And now target the second. Boris, respond. What's wrong with you? Everything is fine, comrade Major. You are damaged. Leave the aircraft. First, I bombed the bridge. Boris, do not Take a chance. Leave the aircraft. Everything will be fine. The bridge ... Gentlemen ... we are going back. Seagulls, assemble! We are returning to the outpost. To all eagles. The enemy is below us! Charge! Seagulls! Enemy is in front of us! Prepare for battle. Seagull 1 is speaking, Slaven, take command. Move away from a conflict. Meadow, meadow .... Seagull 1 is speaking ... I'm coming back to the outpost. Seagull, respond! What happened? Meadow here! Seagull, respond! Jelena. Why are you not landing? - I can not. Abandon the aircraft. - Jelena. Can you hear me, Jelena? - Abandon the aircraft, please! Jelena, I must tell you ... - Abandon the airplane! Jelena. - Abandon the airplane, please! Jelena. Seagull! Seagull! Seagull! Comrade commander, task is completed. -Congratulations, Orlovic. Do I need to blow up passage? - No, we will wait comrades from the airport. - Are there any news about them? No, comrade commander.
