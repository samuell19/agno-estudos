What is it? I told you I didn't want to be disturbed. Come on. What is this? Some kind of a joke? I haven't got time to... My God, you can't. You can't do that. Five, four K, 10, four. Twenty-eight and seven? That's Southwick's. Attention all shoppers. As part of Southwick's policy of cooperation with civilian defense, we participate in an evacuation drill. Attention all shoppers. As part of Southwick's policy in cooperating... Rooney, Escovel, come here. Look, the caller said it was due to go off at 12:30. That gives us 15 minutes. Now you two check the dressing rooms. Let's move it! You two, the back. Go! Go! Hey. See if there's any dressing rooms over there. Hey, check the restrooms in the back. Go to the other side, anybody over there in the back... Police officer. It's an emergency. Let's go. Everybody out. Everybody out! Fire drill! Everybody out! Anybody here? Anybody? Ma'am, you got to get out of here! My man, excuse me. Excuse me. My mother's up here. Watch it. Excuse me, man. Right here. Hey, we got one. Hey, baby, you want to see a show? Hey, how about you come and see a show with me, huh? Hey, you know that purse is funky fresh. What you got in it? Yeah, why don't you open that purse up and maybe spare me and my man some change. Why don't you boys run along? Fake badge. Yeah, fake badge. We trying to get a little bit of money. Come back with some jive when you've grown up. Hey, you got it lady. No problem. Yo, yo. Keep the change, baby, Keep the change. So, why didn't you arrest them? Why didn't I... Well number one, I arrest them today, the courts let 'em out tomorrow. Number two, it's my lunch hour. Number three, I've been wanting to see Les Miserables for months now. I'd lose my place in line. See, you'd get here instead. Every time I get in line and get close to getting the tickets my... My beeper goes off. Excuse me. Take the freight elevator, Kel. It wasn't damaged. Save the feet. A steel fire door fell on her, Kel. We're waiting for the techs and the M.E. They should be here by now. Why aren't they here? What are they doing? Taking the scenic route? You're her partner? Yeah. Sergeant Mulkaney. Homicide. How long were you partners? What I mean is no, ma'am. See, we were just, uh... We were just riding together today. I mean, she's not... See, she wasn't my regular partner, she was a temporary. Where is your regular partner? He called in sick. So who sent Escovel in here into these dressing rooms, Officer Rooney? Well, the field sergeant sent us to round up stragglers, and I told Escovel to come into the dressing rooms and check them out. Because there might be ladies, you know, without clothes on. Where were you when the bomb exploded? On the stairs. I didn't hear you. Where were you? On the stairs! See, I thought Escovel was somewhere behind me. I swear. Was Escovel married? Yeah, I think. He was, uh... He was a waiter or something. Did she have any close friends in the department? Somebody that she and her husband saw socially. Yeah, yeah, she talked about one friend. Paula, something. No, no, it was Pilar. Pilar something. Why? Why do you think, Rooney? Grandma! Sgt. Mulkaney? Right. I'm Pilar Sandovel. What's her husband's name? Jesus. They were newlyweds. Jesus Escovel, please. In the kitchen. Thanks. This way. Thanks for doing this, Pilar. Yeah, well, I guess that's all part of the job. Pilar. What is this? It's Juanita. You guys want to give us a minute alone here? Tell me. She was trying to save lives, Jesus. She was a hero. She didn't suffer. I'm sure of it, Jesus. I made her go in this morning. She didn't want to report. She was afraid. I ordered a Danish. Is this a Danish? Hey! I didn't tell you to take it! Leave it! Well, excuse me. Oh. Oh, I hope I never have to do that again. Yeah, I'm all right. I'm all right. Here you go. What was she afraid of, Pilar? Who? Juanita? Not too much. Phone calls. Phone calls? Yeah. Yeah, every night. Hour after hour. These phone calls. She know who made the phone calls? No. Well, what? Do you think these were in any way connected to her death? Somebody planted a bomb, and Juanita stepped into it. That's it. That's how you see it, huh? Yeah. Yeah, but you're the detective sergeant. So go detect. Me, I'm just a narc. Kelly! DC wants us in the commissioner's office pronto, and pronto, as you know, in police parlance means an hour ago. Get it? Got it. Why? The commissioner doesn't confide in me, Kelly. He merely calls the bureau chief who calls the precinct commander who calls me who tells you. Catch my drift? Caught it. The mayor wants this task force to find out... Come on in. Sit down. Wants this task force to find out exactly how Officer Escovel died, and the party or parties responsible. Two, if there was... You can write this down. If there was negligence on the part of any officer or supervising personnel. Three, why Officer Escovel was where the bomb was. And four, who was the perpetrator or perpetrators, and why and how they planted this bomb. Now we've already had complaints coming from the women's groups, Spanish-American group, Patrolman's Association, Spanish-American Patrolman's Association, Spanish-American Women's Patrol Person's Association... We don't have a department here, gentlemen. What we've got is an association of associations. Co-chairpersons of this task force will be Sergeant Mulkaney and Lieutenant Fahey here. You have carte Blanche, phones, transportation, overtime, whatever. Set your schedules, pick your personnel, write your daily reports, sit down! I want everything in writing. Thank you. Sgt. Mulkaney, may I see you for a second, please? So, why am I heading this task force? Because, you're one of the highest ranking female homicide detectives we've got, because you're on the women's committee, and because I requested you personally. You know what they're going to say about this. About us. Again. Kelly, Kelly, Kelly. You're my friend. Not anymore I'm not. How's Judge what's-his-name? How's your wife? Gosh, you're tough. Why are you so tough, huh? Come on. It's my birthday today. I'm pushing 50. Today. What does the bomb squad say? The bomb squad found a box. Pipe-bomb, 24 hour clock, spring activated, plastic wrapped in a pipe. Crime lab thinks it has a partial fingerprint. They'll know tomorrow. Aren't you going to wish me happy birthday, even? Huh? Do me a favor. Call the crime lab, and tell them I want that partial print shaded and referenced today. Use your influence, okay? Oh, and by the way, happy birthday, Peter. I'd have brought you a present, except what do you give someone who's had everybody? I couldn't sleep. I can't ever sleep when a cop's been killed. I don't know, it's some kind of insult. Go home. You're wasting the department's electricity. I queried the FBI, Interpol, ATF, the CIA. They've cross-referenced terrorist organizations, cross-referenced employees, disgruntled customers, business rivals. I don't know. If we got a mad bomber, why hasn't he contacted the papers and TV? Those guys get off on publicity. Here. You eat that stuff? You been a cop too long. It's 2:00 in the morning. Go home. You're right. You're right. I've been looking through Escovel's files. She wrote up a lot of cops on 604's. Harassment, prejudice, intimidation. Well, some cops are like that. They always got to be writing up somebody. One of the cops she wrote up were Rooney and his partner named Koffman. You think maybe Rooney left her to get blown up by the bomb because she wrote him up on a 604? Escovel was one of the rehires. You know that? One of the women who went to court and sued. Sues to get a job back, and a year later, she's dead. In some circles they would call that irony, eh, Kel? ...keep seeing politicians like you in front of us, elected officials, corrupt officials, who take thousands of dollars off the public treasuries who do nothing less than rob the pockets of the people they're elected to serve. And the court asks, who's worse? You stay up all night and watched that? Nose is crooked. It's your set. Your set's crooked. See that? Perfect nose. But you talk too much. I watered your plants. Good. Did you do my laundry, too? I need stockings. I don't do laundry on Wednesdays. How come you're home so late? Oh, been running arsonists cross-referenced to terrorists cross-referenced to crazies. I'm tired. I'm going to take a shower. Hey, want to wash your judge? You Pilar? Yeah, man, you got that right. I'm Pilar. You got the stuff, man? Come on. Let's go. Back here. I'm coming, I'm coming. Fix you up, huh? You look like you're moving large, brother. You look like your moving large. Yeah, I do pretty good. Yeah. Something's wrong. Something's wrong. We got to get her out of here. It's gone sour. Go! Go! Go, Sculley! All right, let's hit it! What has happened? Get her out of there! Go! Go! Mulkaney. Where? Oh, no. Okay. Got it. It's 4:30. Yeah, I know it is. Where do you have to go at 4:30 in the morning? Got to witness a crime. We lost an undercover. Why do you have to go? The undercover was someone I met with just this afternoon. Name of Pilar. Just this afternoon. Fifth floor, Sergeant. Always. When the building's a walk up. Yeah. Hi, Sarge. Where? Bathroom. If any of the gold braid from Police Plaza shows up, let's keep them out of here, okay, Karl? At least we can do that much for her. Kelly? Seventeen years I've been on this job, Karl. Why do we do it? The violence, the anger. The stench and the dying. Sometimes, I can't find a meaning in it. Sometimes, it just... Maybe I'm just tired. Maybe I've been on this job too long. Well, nobody promised us meaning, Kelly. And we do the job because that's what it takes and that's what we do. Yeah. Kelly, how are you? This is Kelly Mulkaney. Earl Mulkaney's daughter. Earl was my rabbi when I broke in. What the hell do you think you're doing? Put that bottle down! She was on our team. He's taking it kind of hard, Inspector. He's asking for a suspension, that's all! Drinking at the crime scene for God's sake! I want the investigation. This is a homicide. She was whacked on our gig. I get part of the investigation. You don't want to argue with me Mulkaney. Understand that? Come on! Come on. They're in here! Get them the hell out of here! Get them out of here! Take it easy, huh, come on. What's the matter? I want them out! All right, all right. Take it easy. Okay, what happened? It was a drug bust, East Village. Pilar was undercover, she went in to make the buy. We waited till she was cleared, and then we go in to make the collar. She went in the front door. They took her out the back. By the time we come in, the joint was empty. When was this? 2:00. They had her four hours. She was on a wire? Yeah, she was on a wire. Wire. It keeps breaking up. You hear? I'm a cop, man, I'm a cop. We figure it's the microphone. You know, sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. I don't know why they can't get better equipment. You sent a woman in alone on a gig like that? Pilar wanted it that way. She loved going in alone. I mean, she loved it. Any time, any place. She'd, she'd dress up ratty and make up needle marks and scars. She was amazing. Ah, she loved it, the job. She even sued to get it back. Pilar sued to get her job back? Yeah, she sued. Just like the other one. Some coincidence, huh? You experienced in using one of these machines, Sergeant Mulkaney? Oh, yeah. Just turn it off when you're done, and enjoy the show. Thank you. The bitterness over a new N.Y.P.D. contract has festered and erupted into a demonstration by off-duty cops in front of Gracie Mansion. Forced by the budget crisis to cut down expenses, New York City has furloughed 4,000 of New York's finest. And among the more than 4,000 police, 1,000 police women, are furloughed without pay. One thousand police women without a job. But when funds for rehiring are un-frozen and 1,000 officers are re-hired, all are men. Forty-two of the furloughed police women bring suit against the City of New York for unfair hiring practices, sex discrimination and violation of civil rights. As a result of this affirmative action suit, the court orders 150 police women to be rehired by the N.Y.P.D. and the like number of men to be laid off. How in the hell can you mess up on 95 tags? I've just finished three straight tours in a row here. So what? We're talking about male, female dead bodies here. So, I don't understand, Sergeant. I mean, what is this? A review, de-briefing, what? It's a talk, Ernie. Oh. Do I need a lawyer or something, huh? A man needs a lawyer when he's guilty. You guilty of something? Yeah, okay. So what can I do for you? The morning your partner called in sick. When did you know he wasn't riding with you? When I reported in, about 11:30. Duty sergeant told me. What? He didn't call you at home? No, he had an emergency. What's his name? Koffman. Andrew Koffman. He goes by Andrew. His kid was sick in the hospital or something, tonsillitis. Don't partners usually call their partners when they're not coming in? Well, yeah, but maybe he didn't get a chance, all right! Look, maybe I better not say anything without a lawyer. 'Cause I never been through anything... Now once again exactly where were you when the bomb exploded? I was walking out the south door. I thought she was behind me. I swear. Now I don't know if she had time to get out. It was just a tragic accident. How many times did you rehearse that? All right, then, you look. If there's going to be a board of inquiry, I want a departmental lawyer. You understand? Escovel and Sandovel were two of the women who brought suit to get their jobs back. But you know that. 'Cause you were in the courtroom carrying a sign, raising your fist. Is that a crime? This was a free country last I heard. Juanita's husband told us that she was getting threatening phone calls in the middle of the night. You resented Sandovel and Escovel and the other women, didn't you? What, I'm not supposed to resent when friends of mine are getting laid off so they can hire women? We're talking about men with families and responsibilities here. Yeah, I resent it. Where were you last night between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m.? At home. Sleeping with my wife. You want details on that? No. That would be boring, Rooney. And inadequate, I'm sure. What I do want is a copy of your phone bills from the past two months. Listen to me. You want to ask me any more questions, Mulkaney, and I'll call the Patrolman's Association, and I'll get a lawyer, and we'll do this all real nice and legal. Otherwise, I'm going home. You got that? And if I was going to make threatening phone calls, I would do it from a phone booth. Especially if I was calling a cop! I'm not a moron! By the way, your partner, Koffman, where does he live? In Queens. Look it up. Koffman? Koffman? Koffman? Freeze! Hands against the wall! Hands against the wall! Hands against the wall! Hands against the wall! That wall! Don't get... This wall over here! Check my purse! My shield. Don't move. Shut up! Don't get itchy with that thing! Down on the floor! On your face! Hands behind your head! Hands behind your head! Hands behind your head! Shut up! All you had to do was ask for an I.D. Shut up! Shut up. Okay, Mulkaney. Get up. What the hell are you doing in my house? Did you check my shield? Somebody walks into a man's house, you shoot first lady. You're lucky you're not dog food. Now what do you want? I'm investigating the death of Juanita Escovel. Yeah, so? What's Escovel's death got to do with me? She wrote you up on a 604. She wrote everybody up on 604. She loved to write up cops. It was her hobby. I guess she wrote her last 604. You want to tell me about it? No, I don't want to tell you about it. It's in my file. Go read it. Or are we... We falling in love here and making small talk? You can talk to me about it now, or we can go downtown, and you can talk to Internal Affairs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fine. Okay. We run this canvas. The kid and the sexual assaults. Escovel was in the third platoon. I was acting sergeant. I told her to go through the basement in this building, and she refused. Why? Why? That basement was covered with rats and garbage and waste and slime. Nobody wanted to go in. But somebody had to. You're on the job, you do the job. Escovel was on the job! But she said that I told her to go, because she's a woman, and a P.R. and because she sued the department. I said go tell the E.E.O. So she did. She wrote me up for harassment, prejudice, that crap. I got 10 days off the charts. No pay. So, Mulkaney, you're gonna make me into the mad bomber. Are you? There's a serial killer out there who's whacking cops! You want to file on me! Go ahead! But get me a lawyer first, okay? Or get the hell out of here! Get out of here now! Get out of here! Hello. Hello. Listen... Cuban? Hi, Pop. Hi, darling. Come in, Kel. We're going to O'Hallahan's, remember? Murphy's wake. The only wake I'll be going to is my own. Even then, I might walk out. Oh, Pop, it's 80 degrees outside. It's hot. Don't tell me it's hot. I'll tell you when it's hot. Where do you want to eat? Mario's opened up again. They got that green pasta you like. Chinese down the street is good. I worked last week. Two days. Fork lift. In the hole. Still got it. Muscle. If you're so tough, why not go to Murphy's wake? Look, I'm going to a cop's wake. You want to come along? Or you want to eat the green pasta by yourself? Who said I wasn't coming? * Oh, God bless you * And keep you * Mother McRea Well, up the rebels. He was a good man, Murphy. A good cop. The I.A. bastards got him. Up the rebels. You see Ma? What for? She don't know me. Maybe she does. I'm tough, darling. I ain't that tough. I'll be right back. Don't let them take my drink. Can I help? Yeah, I need a match. You got one? Can I sit down? You're Sergeant Mulkaney, aren't you? I saw you lecture at the Academy. He didn't show, huh? He didn't show. No. Anyone I know? Well you wait in a cop's bar, Detective, you're usually waiting for a cop, isn't that right? You're one of the woman who sued for re-instatement. Aren't you? Yeah, Megan McGuire. Yeah, I sued. I'm one of the ones who's still alive. Then you knew Escovel and Sandovel? I knew Juanita. Pilar... Pilar moved in different circles if you know what I mean. No, tell me. Juanita and me, we would take the subway near the courthouse, and Pilar, she would take a cab. We would eat at the cafeteria, Pilar would be dining at Le Cirque. She showed me this bracelet once. Cost one year's salary. Look, I know... I appreciate you... Have you gotten phone calls? Hang-ups? Call again. Hang up? Only two or three hundred a night. Why don't you report it? Who would you like me to report this to? You know, my field supervisor? Or the desk officer, maybe? Or the chief? Look, I know you're well intentioned. I know that. I just want to work this out by myself, okay? Okay, fine. But if you want to talk about anything, job related or personal, here's my card. Call me. My home phone's on there, day or night. Call. Ah, look, look. Look at that. Today's cops. Hair over their collar. Greased up like a convention of tango dancers. Ah, things fall apart, Kelly. Yeah. The center cannot hold. They want to cut me. The doctors. They want to take a tiny look inside, like it was a secret they need to know. Let them. Nah. If I check out, I'm checking out with my parts intact. Thank you very much. And a whiskey in my hand. Is that what good diesel oil tastes like? Let them cut you, Earl. Hush, hush. Hush. I seen this one cop. Tall, lean, six foot, short hair, neat as a pin, and he was gay for God's sake. Ah, what shall we do with this absurdity of the troubled world? Let's go see Ma, Pop. At this time of night? Ah, maybe tomorrow, huh? Let's go see her now. Well, Catherine. The flowers are out along the bridal trails now in the park. And they're selling orange juice off the carts. It's time to put away the wool coat now. Catherine... Old Father O'Brien, you remember him? He married us. He died. Oh, Pop. Which apartment is Mrs. Sandovel's? What do you want? The police. My aunt's not seeing anybody. She'll see us. The first door on your left. Mrs. Sandovel? Mrs. Sandovel? Yes? Oh, hello. I'm Sergeant Mulkaney, and this is Lieutenant Fahey. We're here to ask you some questions about your daughter's death. I think you come here to ask me about phone calls. Yes, and to see Pilar's room and her things. My daughter's room? Yes. It's way back. Thank you. Mrs. Sandovel, I don't understand. I mean, where are Pilar's things? Her make-up, her clothes, her jewelry? At her house. But this is the address on file at Police Plaza. It was because of the phone calls. She didn't want the police to know where she lived. So she lived somewhere else? Where? She lives on East 84th Street. It's not far from here. It's not far, it's the other side of the world. Hey, you! You can't park here. So, she was on the pad. ...can't make any money. Thank you very much. What do you want, huh? Well... What is this? An inventory of an apartment on East 84th Street. You thinking of moving, Kel? I couldn't afford the rent, Sculley. But you know who lived in that apartment, don't you? Who owned the furniture and clothes and jewelry? How long was she on the pad? You know what you should do is look through my sheets. You should check my bank accounts. You want to see my watch? It's a Rolex. I bought it off a street junkie. It's probably hot. You want the numbers in my bank account? What the hell does she want? All right sit down. Look here, Kel? You're way out of line here. You're chasing a cop killer. You come in here and stick a paper in a man's face like it's a accusation or something. You of all people. I'm disturbed, Kelly. I really am. I just want to know how a policewoman could afford that apartment. Maybe she invested wisely, huh? Maybe she had a rich boyfriend. Yeah, Donald Trump. I got to get out of here. Here, this should cover for the drinks. I don't want we should accept something free around here. All these silent accusations. Let me tell you something, you get your cop killer, you bring him in however you can, but you stay out of my squad, because you don't want to know what you don't want to know. You do something like that, you should wear a wire. I won't wear a wire. What's he doing here? I asked Inspector Brown to join us. You brought Internal Affairs into this? What I told you was between you and me. You don't have to be my friend, Mulkaney. I don't want to be your friend, Brown. Listen, the whole unit is dirty. We've known it. We've known it for a long time. That's your business, not mine. Kelly, Kelly, Kelly. We're missing a unique opportunity. Get your tongue out of my ear, Commissioner. This is what we want you to do for us. No, I won't wear a wire. Work with us, Kelly. Internal Affairs is not your enemy. I'll tell you a story about Internal Affairs. Particularly you, Inspector. The commissioner here knows it all too well. There was this cop. A dumb, mic cop, regular guy, never ever made sergeant, lived in Flatbush, raised five kids, brother was a priest. Anyway, it's his daughter's birthday, and he's off shift, and walking in the subway, he smells smoke. He's off duty so he figures he'll call in the alarm. But something tells him to check it out. Okay, you know the rest. He goes into the building. There's a baby on the top floor. Fire and smoke and all that. He winds up jumping from the second floor, baby in his arms. He breaks both legs, burns his lungs. Medal of honor, department citation, policeman of the month, all of that. Internal Affairs comes to him in the hospital. Interrogates him about taking a free lunch and a couple of beers on Sunday. They want him to rat on his partners. This cop is on full oxygen because his lungs are burned, and they want him to turn over his partners for a free lunch and a couple of beers. I can tell you're bored, but just to let you know, my father resigned rather than turn over his partners for a free lunch and a couple of beers. And you bastards want me to wear a wire. Okay, no wire. We need you on the job. I don't want any more policewomen killed. We got a few bad... We got a few bad cops. And the press and the media and the cop haters of the world all get off on hammering us. That's why we got to get to them first to protect the honor of the badge. Understand. I won't wear a wire. What the... What is it... What are you doing? Come on. Come on. Come on. Move. Move. Move. Get in. What's going on? Shut up! Get the... Shut up. You guys gonna rob a bank? You're getting into things you shouldn't. Yeah? What? Don't screw up. Skip the melodrama. I'm a cop. And you're cops. Under those clown outfits. What makes you think we're cops? You might as well wear your shield on your lapel. You'd be less obvious. Okay, so what's this all about? If you don't mind, I've got to stop and see my therapist. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, come on. Let's go, let's go. Come on. You know, you don't want to know what you don't want to know Mulkaney. You understand? No, tell me what I don't want to know. Look. You think a cop killed all those women? You're crazy. It was a psycho, plain and simple. He hates women. He's got a mother complex. So I should lay off cops who are on the take. Is that the idea? Now you shouldn't ought to say things like that. I mean, what kind of language is that? What are you a dummy or something? Look... This is a very dangerous place. People fall out of windows, get killed, maimed, disfigured. A body like you got Mulkaney, it would be a desecration. You know the homeless, the winos, the junkies, the skells, they live here. Oh, the city tries to flush 'em out. But they hide, lose their footing, fall, get killed. Crushed. You know those dummies that they test the car crashes on? You know, they get all thrown around, break their arms, their legs, their neck? Imagine what would happen to a person like that. Sometimes it happens. Sometimes, sometimes it happens to people who are not winos. So, whatever comes by, comes by. Hey! Hey! It's what comes by you, dummy! You can become part of this landscape! Give me the commissioner, please. Sergeant Mulkaney. Well, interrupt him! Don't put me on hold! Please, I would like to speak with the commissioner immediately. Yes. Peter. It's Kelly. I'm in. Tell Internal Affairs whatever they want. This time, they picked on the wrong policewoman. Thanks. Paper lady? No thanks, not today pal. I need a coffee and a bagel. Coffee and a bagel. I can tell you're from New York, Kelly. Yeah, how's that? You eat what you can hold in your hand. You probably come in here without knowing it, huh? I eat breakfast here all the time. Right. Tell me, Kelly... Pass the mustard. How's the law enforcement business? You catching many bad guys lately? Tell me something, Sculley. How could one of your squad be on the pad without the other partner's knowing it? You don't put butter on a bagel, what's the matter with you? You on a wire, Kel? Never with pearls, Sculley. See the reason I ask is things have changed since me and your dad rode together. Nowadays, you don't know who's a stand-up cop and who isn't. Stand-up cops who like to wear funny masks and threaten people with falling refrigerators. Is that the kind you're talking about, Sculley? If I was you, I'd take that message serious, Kel. I'm saying this, because your old man was a stand-up cop. And you were a darling girl. You still are a doll. If you don't have that bagel, I'll take it with me. Everything ain't black and white, Kelly. Everybody's got something ain't exactly kosher. Fallible human beings, all of us. Sometimes you got to look the other way. If you're still hungry, try those knishes. They're exemplary. You okay lady? Oh, yeah, yeah, I guess so. What the hell was that? Clowns. Yeah? Hi, Fahey. What are you? Dirty Harriet? Yeah. The FBI's got something on the bombers, Kel, but the pipeline dried up. It's something they're not sharing. When are they going to share it? When some more policewomen are dead? You figuring on fighting an army? A squad maybe. Pretty big gun for a little girl, Kel. .38's no good against body armor. People don't usually wear body armor, Kel. Cops do. I don't like this. Cops afraid of cops. I've arranged for a unit in front of your building 24 hours. Okay. You won't get an argument out of me. I want you to wear body armor from now on, too. I don't know. You wearing body armor is like wrapping a candy bar in a lead pipe. Hi, it's me. The kids had orthodonture, and their mother has to go out of town, so they're staying with me for the rest of the week as part of their visitation rights. So, I can't be with you. Look, you're the one who insists on separate residences. I won't sleep. I roll around a lot, break out in rash. I've got Wednesday free. So, you and I can, you know, we could get married. Listen you... I got something for you, Mulkaney. Because you're a stand-up cop, and we both want Pilar's killer. Now, I want you to meet me at midnight on the roof of the Royal Building. Now, that means you alone. No partners, no wires and no backups. You understand? I'm not meeting you on any rooftop Roselli. You want to meet, we'll meet. Some place in public. We'll meet... The Broadway Theater. 53rd and Broadway, 11:00. All right. Okay. Mulkaney, no wires. No wires. Goodbye. Oh, boy. Officer McGuire, what are you doing here? I hope I'm not... I was just on my way up to see you. Actually, I'm running very late. Look, I didn't know who else to talk to you, Sergeant. Can you get me transferred? Well, it's okay. It's okay. I'll come back. Come here. Sit down. You're in no condition to be out on the street. What's the matter? I'm scared, Sergeant. I'm scared all the time. Every time we're out there, rolling on a call my heart starts beating like crazy. I can't get my breath. Why don't you call in sick? Can you just get me transferred? Please. All right. I'll talk to your precinct commander tomorrow. No! No, do it tonight. All right, I'll get you assigned to me tonight. And tomorrow we'll talk to your precinct commander. He'll be okay. You have my word. Now go report in. It'll be okay? Yeah. Yeah. See you later. Hey. Yeah, Karl? Kelly, here. I want you to assign Officer Megan McGuire to me tonight, and find her a unit, keep her off the charts, okay? You got it. We'll rendezvous at 52nd off Broadway. Karl... Yes? Get me a car at a police compound. Something fast. You got it. Got it. All right. Bye. We're going to have to talk about it sooner or later. I need to talk... Mulkaney! Come here. Come here. You come here. What is this? A contest of wills or what? You seen that show? Great show. I'm certainly happy you're sharing that with me. Anything else you would like to discuss here? Just want to go for a walk. See if you're wearing a wire. What the hell is that? Body armor you got on, huh? A one-piece chastity belt. What do you want? I want to talk to you, but I want to go to some place quiet. All right with you? Pilar was dirty. Really. I thought she saved her small change for that apartment and jewelry and stuff. You remember the big drug bust last summer at the Holland Hotel? Remember that? Yeah. Sure. Pilar skimmed 50K right off the top before she turned in the money. Yeah. How much did you get? Come on, Kelly. That's not nice. I never took a dime from anybody. I never skimmed a bust. I never shook anybody down. I never walked away from a colleague. Whether you believe it or not, I'm Mr. Clean. Why didn't you turn her in, Mr. Clean? You don't drop a dime on your partner. What's the matter with you? Why are you telling me this, Roselli? The bottom line is this. I know that it's going to come down pretty soon. All of it is going to come down. And I know you're tight with the commissioner. And I figure when that time comes, Kelly, I need... I need you to put in a good word for me. You want me to put in a good word for you? Kelly, I am desperate. I need you... You rat on a dead partner, and I know you're protecting live ones. And you want me to put in a word for you? All right. Here's something else for you. We suspect that the Ruiz brothers took her out. They're small time dealers, hit men, street people, what have you. And we figure that someone tipped them off that Pilar was heat. And we figure that it was done deliberately so that... Who tipped them off? Who knows? It was some cop in the precinct. She wasn't... Who? Listen to me. I don't know. She wasn't well liked. Everyone in the precinct knew who the Ruiz brothers were. We figure it was some cop in the precinct. Don't you understand that? I'm telling you the truth. Thanks for meeting with me. Where in the hell's McGuire? McGuire? She and her partner answered a call. They were assigned to me. They weren't supposed to answer calls. I don't know. Maybe they specified that unit or something. When? About five minutes ago. Look. Get on the horn and get the address of that call and tell the dispatcher to contact me on a tack frequency. - Five, exit four. - Five, exit four. See the woman at 620 East 30th, apartment 2A. Repeating address 620, East 30th, apartment... Open up! Police! What do you want? Police! Open the door! What do you want? We got a report, from one of your neighbors of a woman here screaming for help. Screaming? Can we come in please? Come in. Hey, uh, what's going on here? Your neighbors reported a disturbance, Mr... Weisman. Look, they reported what? Well, seems that they thought that you were beating me up, honey. Well, look, maybe we was a little noisy. But those screams, well, look, let's just say that I was not beating up my wife. It was something a little more... Well, more friendly if you catch my drift. Bye-bye. The complaint came from 5A. Check it out. Guess we're going to walk. Come on, Megan. Watch your step, Megan. Let me turn the lights on up here. I can't find them. Come on. Tom? What now? The officers that were here, where are they? Upstairs. Which floor? The fifth. Hey, they were making noise, too. Megan! Tom? I figure he's in the elevator. Megan enters the building. No light. The electricity's off, but he can see her in silhouette. Here. No. Come on. Her back's to him. Coming out of the apartment. Just enough light to grab her hair and cut her throat. What are you all standing around for? I want it canvassed! You take this building floor by floor and get names! Then do the neighborhood! Building by building! Work a grid. Talk to everybody. Everybody's off the charts until we find this guy! What happened? Jansen! Can I get my breath? You can get your breath later. I want you to tell me what happened. Look, there was a... There was a complaint from apartment 5A about a disturbance in 2A, which it wasn't really a complaint so we decided to check out... McGuire was with you? Yeah, when we started upstairs. Don't answer so quickly, I want you to think about it! I don't have to think about it. I'm telling you when we started upstairs she was behind me. I came out on the fifth floor, and she was gone. Look. I went into this apartment over here. It was empty. I heard somebody up on the roof, so I took pursuit, went down the fire escape, 10 blocks. I got winded. I lost him. I come back here. I never thought the killer would go for Megan. What do you mean you never thought? She was a prime target. You know that. How could anybody know she'd be answering this call? I mean, we just got a call from the dispatcher. I mean, how could they know? Yeah, how? Give me the results of the post on Megan McGuire. By Morgan Christopher, M.D. Etcetera, pathologist, etcetera, City of New York, etcetera. Just the results. Friend, huh? Well, maybe somebody else should handle this. Just the results. Her esophagus was dissevered. Lower jaw distended. I'm afraid it wasn't a painless death. Forensic? Well, she put up a fight. Skin under her fingernails from a male "cauc." Heavy beard. Between 25 and 50. Type AB blood. He should have scratches if you find him. I'll walk you out. Since you were her friend I guess there's something else you should know. Oh, no. About 13 weeks. It would have been a boy. Oh, God. Why did you bring me here? Thank you, doctor. Didn't you think Megan's pregnancy would show up on the autopsy? Did she expect you to divorce your wife and marry her? On the streets all day. A man needs friendship, understanding. Isn't that the way it was, Tom? She didn't... She didn't want an abortion. It was against religion. And it just happened. I was lonely and... You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for you. Is that what you think? You knew somebody was hunting down the women who were involved in that lawsuit. You knew Megan was terrified. You knew she was one of the leaders, and you still abandoned her? What? No! I wasn't thinking. I didn't know! If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say will be held against you. What do you think? Do you think I'm a killer? Is that what you think? What's your blood type? O positive. Why? You made those calls. You and Rooney and Koffman and probably some of the others. You hated those women. Maybe you hate all women. You're in trouble, man. You're facing a suspension and possibly a murder charge. Look, I, uh... Can we talk some place? Just you and me? You and me and somebody else. You know they tearing up all the cross-town streets? It looks like Beirut out there. So what do you want? Give me... What do I want? Give me a coffee and a bagel. No bagels. Give me a muffin. No muffins. What is this? Vaudeville? Give me something to eat! Hey, you said no notes. I lied. Want a smoke? No wait a minute. You don't get no smoke unless you start talking or I'll shove your head into a toilet bowl! Now who were the others? They'll kill me. Good! I'll investigate the murder, and not too thoroughly! What is this? We're not communicating? Look, we've played some games with the women. We gave them some garbage details. We scared them. Made some phone calls. But we never killed nobody! I want the names of all the cops that made the phone calls and harassed the women! All! Whatever rank! Whatever precinct! You have no right. He's got no right! No, you got no right, Jansen! You're a whiner, a complainer and a coward! You make me feel dirty! Don't tell me about rights! You miserable son of a bitch! If you had stayed with your partner she might be alive today! And your baby, too! He's yours. Do what you want with him. So, where are the others? We'll meet them on Flushing. Nobody said anything to me about Flushing. It's change. I don't like changes. Then don't do it. All right, let's go. Let's do it. I've got an important announcement. I think my arm is asleep. It's about the only thing that is around here. You noticed. I'd like to turn the page, but, uh... I can't move my arm unless you move your head. I can't move my head unless you move your arm. Let's see what we can do here. This is starting to get interesting. Mmm, yeah. Want to play doctor? I'll tell you my case. You tell me yours. Take your time. It's at least two hours before the alarm goes off. Don't be so helpful. Okay? Helping law enforcement's part of my job. Yeah, yeah. I'm coming. Okay. Yeah? Gilmore Brown. They want us cross town. Cross town? Why us? A warehouse in Queens... Here come the judge. Here come the judge. That's amusing. Why Queens? Why us? Why indeed? They got your mad bomber, by the way. Why didn't anybody tell me about it? The Feds arrested him day before yesterday. Naturally they kept it to themselves until they could claim jurisdiction. Throws out New York prosecution. So, Escovel was an accident. Wrong place. Wrong time. Come back. Yeah, little more, little more. So, Lieutenant, spell Roselli. R-O-S-E-L-L-I. You got it? They were waiting for him. Just like Pilar. Where were his partners? At home. They don't know anything, so they say. He had a wife. Somebody should tell his wife. Karl? Let's get a blood type on him. Get some samples of the skin and facial hair. Send it over to forensics. The forensics on Roselli. What is this? The season for dead cops? Roselli. Oh, the hair samples are still in the lab, but you were right about the blood type, and the scratches on his cheek are consistent. Any evidence to suggest that he didn't kill Megan McGuire? Well, not that I can find. So, why should Roselli kill McGuire? She wasn't in his precinct. She had nothing to do with him. She probably didn't know him. Probably didn't. Escovel was killed by the mad bomber. Unconnected, unrelated. But Roselli sees a chance to get rid of Pilar, so he blames it on the serial killer. So he creates a serial killer by killing a third policewoman. Yeah. Maybe he had more planned. Who knows? What about his partners? One way to find out. Not too tight on the tape, Kerrigan. And it should come off easily. Okay, Kerrigan. Thanks. All right. Now this cost $10,000 so don't lose it. The other one you can throw away, but this, be very careful. Where's the transmitter? There isn't any. It works by microwave. A miracle of technology. Let's hope. What's the range on this miracle? It's about a mile. It works better in the open. So, please, stay out in the open. They'll take me somewhere. We'll follow you by scanner. Don't worry, I won't lose you. Promise? I'll stake your life on it. Why, Inspector, you made a joke. Kelly, you don't have to do this. Sure I do. But thanks for your concern. Well, hell they're our leftovers. I don't like leftovers, Peter. When it's over, it's over. Hey. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. I bless you Victoria with the holy water that recalls the day of your rebirth in the living waters of baptism. That day which St. Paul has written, "When we were baptized, "we went into the tomb with him and joined him in death." So, that as Christ was raised from the dead... You set him up, Sculley. You pulled out and then, left him to die just like Pilar. That's a serious accusation, Kelly. Murder's a serious thing, Sculley. You guys saw the bombing as an opportunity to get rid of Pilar, but why'd you have to kill McGuire? She didn't do anything to you. You come to my partner's funeral with garbage like that. Who in the hell do you think you are? Excuse us. Excuse us. We got to go. We got a call to make. Come on, Sergeant. ...relatives at this mass earnestly pray for him. In the compassion of God and that peace and that joy which are the promise of the Christian faith. Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the light. If anyone believes in me..." You know your trouble is? You got no respect for a fellow officer. A dead one at that. Come on. We're getting out of here. Get in there. Go on. Where are we going, Sculley? Where are you taking me? Now you just be still and keep quiet. Give me your piece. Give me that damn wire. You wear a wire in the church, huh? Do you think God will forgive that? God has a lot of forgiving to do around here. Earl Mulkaney's daughter. The daughter of a real cop wearing a wire. Roselli was a real cop, and he's dead. McGuire was a real cop, and she's dead. Pilar was a real cop. Pilar! He's gonna take the bridge. She was taking from us. She was taking from the Feds. She was taking from the IAU. She was taking from the dealers. She was taking from everybody. That woman was greedy. You're not greedy. You're just dirty, huh? Nobody starts out dirty. You're on the job. You eat a hamburger. You drink a cup of coffee. You look out for the proprietor. You get a free lunch. What the hell, you leave a big tip for the waitress. I mean, is that dirty, is that dirty? Then you move up. Bigger jobs... Go around them. Come on. Then contracts get offered. You know what a contract is? You're paid to turn the other way. It's a "C" note. It's a grand. You look the other way when a deal comes down. It's a grand, it's five grand. Kids' braces get paid for. Take your wife to the Bahamas. And then you're dirty, huh? Yeah, yeah. And then you're dirty. First you take your wife to the Bahamas. And then you start killing cops. We didn't kill nobody. It's all dying out there. This city. This job. It's terminal. Everybody's out to get his. It's a way of life. Kelly, you got to understand. Victor and me, when we started out, we were clean. But you're on a team. The boys say you're in. They say you don't go playing, you're not one of us. You're not part of a team. You got to be part of a team. Your life depends on it. So we bought in. We looked the other way. We split a hundred G's the first year. We were rich people. Yeah, you were rich, all right. Why'd you have to kill those women? I told you before. We didn't kill nobody. Pilar joined the group. She bought into our contract. She wanted in. Then when she gets laid up, we continue to pay her off. Can you fix that? I'm losing her. Damn it. Are you telling me Roselli knocked off Pilar all by himself? I'm telling you, he made a deal with the Ruiz brothers. He burned her. We didn't know nothing about it. You want me to believe that? Frankly, I don't give a... Get lost, you jerk. She's gone. She's gone. We got to figure this out, Kelly. We got to figure out what we're going to do in this situation. I ain't no genius. But I got 19 years on the force, Kelly. We got to, we got to figure this out. If Roselli did kill Pilar, why didn't you turn him in? He was my partner! You don't turn your partner over! Don't you understand nothing? So you set him up in that warehouse, the same way he set up Pilar. Because of the third one, because of McGuire. When he killed her, we knew he was crazy. He'd lost it. He was crazy. You're all crazy. Ah, Kelly. Kelly! Shoot if you want Sculley. I'm going for a walk. I'll do it, Kelly! I swear! I'll do it! Be about 6:00 before I get to the station house! I expect by then you'll have turned yourself in! Kelly, I swear on my mother, I'll do it! Why'd you have to kill him? Why didn't you just turn him in? Because Victor was a good cop once. He made 1,000 collars, but nobody will ever remember that. They won't remember the collars. All they'll remember is the killer of women. But we sent him out with honor. For the honor of the badge! Honor of the badge. 6:00 Sculley. 6:00. Hey, Kelly! We solved your case for you. Huh? We got your serial killer for you! Honor of the badge. Huh, Kelly? Twenty-thousand good cops. A few bad ones. Yeah, and all you ever hear about is the ones gone sour. Well, the whiners and the screamers, next time they're in trouble, let 'em call their local police review board. See how much protection that buys them. Yeah. Honor of the badge. Hell, that's all we've got.
