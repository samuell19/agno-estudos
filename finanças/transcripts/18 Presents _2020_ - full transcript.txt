NETFLIX PRESENTS [classical music playing] [woman in Italian] Good idea, well done. I like it. Mm-hmm, I'll meet you at the office later. That way you can tell me if there are other possibilities or if you can think of anything else. Is that OK? Perfect. See you later, then. Bye. THINGS TO DO: 1. SWIMMING POOL MEMBERSHIP 2. MANUAL FOR NEW WEBSITE 3. PAINT ROOM [man] Elisa? Yeah? [man] Can you come upstairs? I'm coming. What's up? [exhales] I figured it all out. - So, listen to me for a second, OK? - OK, but I have to go in five minutes. Corner for us, Ruzzetti kicks it. All right? We all stand here on the edge of the penalty box, all lined up like a train. - Can that be done? - Of course it can. The ball is kicked. Rullo attacks the first post, Chiodelli attacks the second post, the two in the middle block their center-backs, and who remains in the center of the penalty box all alone? - Tasselli. - Tasselli... who's terrible with his feet but is the best we have with headers. Am I a genius or what? - They certainly don't expect it. - Of course they don't. - We score, and I raise the Coppa Italia. - Are you mad? - The Coppa Italia! - Put me down! [chuckles] And if we win, I'll buy you a gift. What would you like? You know what I want. I asked you for it months ago. I want you to clean this room. Why not do it today? - [man] I have training today. - [sighs] No, you have it tonight. Listen, I was thinking, why don't we make that the baby's room? This again? You see the road from there. The garden's here. Well, it can come here and look whenever it likes. Come on! Sorry, but this is my studio. All my things are in here. It's not like this baby can just come and take over the whole space. Why do you always have to put things off? Life goes on. Things change. There's nothing wrong with that. OK, so let me decide for once. See what effect it has on you. - You're right. - Yeah? Thanks. You can decide next time. - All right. - But for now, at least clean the walls so I can whitewash this weekend. - [panting] Should I say OK? - Mm-hmm. OK, then. Thank you. - [kisses and laughs] - [Elisa] Stop it. I have to go. - You said five minutes. - It's been five minutes. [sighs] Have a productive day! [breathing heavily] - [dishes clanking] - [footsteps departing] You never give up, do you? [cheerful music playing] You told me Mr. Giovanni was a good man, but he wasn't fair with me. Gazim, why were you laid off? I don't know. He said that I'm slow, but I always do more than the others! OK. Here's what we'll do. First, we'll find you a job, even if it's part-time, so you can make ends meet. When something more stable comes in, I'll let you know. OK? [woman] InJob Agency, hello? Yes, that's us. Help yourself. [woman] We're open from 9.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. and from 4.00 p.m... [Elisa gasps] [ultrasound beeps] [heart beating on ultrasound] [ultrasound buzzes] [woman] Take another deep breath for me. [Elisa inhales deeply] [woman] Hold it in. - And breathe out. - [exhales] - Just a moment. - Is there a problem? - Sorry for making you wait. - How's the baby? [stammers] It was just a small placental abruption, but there's a lot of fluid, the placenta is in the right place, and the bleeding has already stopped. You can calm down. The baby girl is fine. - It's a girl? - Yes, hadn't they told you yet? No. [chuckles] - It's a girl. - Oh, God! [laughs, sighs] I hoped for it. [laughs] [inhales] A little girl. [chuckles] Unfortunately, though, there is a problem. It's to do with you. We repeated the ultrasound examination... twice, and I've already requested a biopsy. A biopsy for... [doctor] There's... a suspected tumor. [man] Have you chosen, ma'am? - Ma'am? - This one. But I will see my daughter, won't I? [sighs] [inhales] I will meet my daughter? [chuckles] [man] Do you need anything else? No. [thunder rumbles] [unintelligible chatter on radio] [heart beating on ultrasound] [chatter continues on radio] [heart beating intensifies] [radio switches off] [heart beating intensifies] [babies crying] WELCOME ANNA AUGUST 21, 2001 Anna.

Do you want to open it later, just me and you? - I already know what it is. - I already know, too, but these kids think that your mom gave you a wardrobe. [crowd laughs] Whereas, I think, if we open it, they'll be green with envy. Huh? - Fine. - OK. [inhales] And... [crowd exclaims] Go on, Anna, play us something. [whispers] Go on, Anna-Banana. [Anna sighs] [Anna's father gasps] [note plays] - [note plays] - Can I play something? Hmm? Of course you can, Lorenzo. Go for it. Why don't you play us a nice four-handed song? [playing "Brother John"] [yelps] Anna! Come back here right now! I never asked for a piano, and I don't want it! Thank you so much, Alberto, and again, I'm sorry. Never mind. Don't worry about it. It's all right. Anyway, are you sure you don't want us to talk to her? This again! He said he'd take care of it. Stop insisting. Please, don't reprimand her. It had to happen sooner or later. Poor thing, really, she's been so good this whole time. She has been good, yes. [keys jingle] You've been good too. - Elisa would be proud of you. - Come on, let's go. The girl is alone in the house. [car departing] [sighs] Anna? Anna? Anna? Anna? Get down. Anna, get down right now. It's dangerous! Come on! Give me your hand. Get down! [exhales] Anna, why are you doing this? I don't want Mommy's gifts anymore. Listen... [sighs] Your mom... went on a very long trip. I don't believe you. But it's not a long trip in terms of distance... but a long trip in terms of time. Yeah. Is she dead? [inhales deeply] Come to Daddy. [breathes heavily] [sorrowful string music playing] BORN JUNE 15, 1966 DIED AUGUST 21, 2001 [music intensifies and darkens] What are you doing? An inward dive. Are you sure? I've never made it from here. Roberto told me. We can do it, trust me. Come on! Foot. - What the fuck is she doing? - Arms. Angelica! Hey, Anna! - One... - [coach] Get down! - Girls! Angelica! - Two... - [whistle blows] - Three! [coach] Stop! [crowd gasps and exclaims] [crowd chatters] [woman] Oh, my God! - How is she? - Fine, thank God. But she could've broken her back. Your daughter too. Do you want her off the team? She did it deliberately. I have no choice. You were a coach. You know that. Today is her birthday. It's not an easy day for her. You can't smoke in the car. - Since when? - Since today. [Anna] What the fuck have you put up, garlands? I'm not six. [Anna's father] Listen... why don't you call your diving friend and invite her to the party? - At least then you can apologize. - She's not my friend. [sighs] Who are your friends? Because I'd love to know. Look who's talking! No, you stay put and listen to me. What, you think you're the only one hurting? Have you ever thought about me? Your grandparents? You could have a life again. You've had the time. - I've tried. - But no one lived up to my mom. - Don't you dare talk about Mom... - You can't take it anymore either! Every year with this gifts bullshit, why? - Because your mom wanted... - But she isn't here! - She never has been. - So, what you gonna do? - Stay mad your whole life? - Better than believing in ghosts. Listen, you're going to go in that house, greet everyone, open your mother's last gift, put a damn smile on your face, and eat some damn cake. Is that clear? Like one big happy family. [lighter clicks] [softly] Yes... like one big happy... family. [woman in English] Hi, darling! [grunts] [in Italian] What's up with your dad? Come on. - Come on, stub out that cigarette and... - You can piss off too! - Where do you need to go? - It depends. Where are you going? There's a little place nearby with great beer. Fancy it? - Deal. - Get in. Uh, honey, listen... my client meeting is dragging on a bit, so I'm not going to get home till late. Don't wait up. [kisses] I love you. Bye. [coin clatters] - [man] Hey. - Everything OK? Yeah, I just found a penny on the floor. It brings good luck. [scoffs] Look, it's not a great color, but I promise it tastes exceptional. [exhales] How old are you? [Anna sighs] - What about you? - Guess. Forty. [chuckles] Thirty-nine. I'm turning 40 next week. How did you guess? You have the face of a 40-year-old. Ah. All right. OK. Actually, today is my birthday. [burps] We need to celebrate then! Let's celebrate. - There's nothing to celebrate, trust me. - Why not? Because today is also the day my mother died. [stammers] Today? - [Anna] Mm. - [sniffles] No... When I was born. She didn't even have time to see me. But... on my birthday, her stupid fucking gift is always there waiting for me. You're joking, right? [kisses] [under breath] I don't believe this. There... You... Your mom was Elisa, Alessio's wife. And who the fuck are you? I'm Walter, and you're Anna, right? Alessio was my soccer coach. I came to your house loads of times. I even came to your first few birthdays. - Ah. - Aye. How fun, huh? [laughing] Does your father know you're here? I came of age today, OK? - You can fuck me without his permission. - Shh. Fuck you? Are you kidding? What are you saying? No way! - Come on, I'll take you home. - [loudly] Don't touch me! Do I need to call your dad? Do whatever the fuck you want. I'm calling your dad. What are you doing? I'm calling your dad! [Anna] Oh. Hi, Alessio? How are you? It's Walter. No... [upbeat music playing] [Walter] Anna! Anna! [action music playing] [panting] [Walter] Anna! - [car starts] - [Walter] An... [engine revs] [Walter] Anna, stop! Anna! Anna, no, no, no! My bike! What the fuck? - [Walter] Whoa, stop. Whoa! - [man] Fucking stop! Stop! What the fuck is she doing? [panting] [man] Stop! Stop! Where the fuck are you going? [tired squeal] [rain drops patter] [car door opens] [car door closes] Are you OK? Can you hear me? Are you OK? Where did you come from? I didn't see you. I tried to stop. Can you get up? Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Why were you crossing like that? I could've killed you! I waved at you. Waved? Can't you see we're in the dark on a provincial road? That's the last thing I needed. [thunder rumbles] - I'll take you to the hospital. Come on. - No. I'm fine. - But I can't just leave you here. Come on. - Not the hospital. - Where are you taking me? - We'll go to my house, for now. It's not far. Then, we'll see. - [Anna] You live here? - [Elisa] Yes. [thunder rumbles] Come on! Move it! - What's wrong? - [Anna] My head's spinning. [Elisa] Come on, walk forward. Come in. I'll get you some water. Here. Let's dry your hair a bit. Give it here. [tuts] Yikes. Does it hurt? Give me a minute. MAY 2001 [breathing heavily] - [thunder rumbling] - [footsteps approaching] - You're pregnant? - Yes. [Anna breathing heavily] What's your name? Elisa. Sit down. Let me see. Ah! What is that? Oh, it's acetone. I'm sorry! - Is it burning? - What do you think? [car arrives] Come on. Like this, OK? This way. WE WANT 11 WARRIORS Elisa! Elisa! [Anna] Who's that? [Alessio] Hey! Since nobody'll come see us in Florence, we thought we'd cheer ourselves on. [chuckles] - It's lovely. - [man] Hi, Elisa. - [man 2] Hi, Elisa. - [man 3] Hey. [Alessio] OK, guys, we're done for the night. Get to bed early, you two. - Good night. - [man] Bye. Hi, darling. What's wrong? I... I ran over a girl. You what? She's fine. At least I think she is. - What do you mean, "think"? - Only a few scratches. - Did you take her to hospital? - No. She's in our living room. "In our living room"? [exhales] Are you OK? - I'm fine. - OK. Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Alessio. Anna. How are you? Are you OK? Does your arm hurt? Have we met? I don't think so. - No, because you look... - I need the toilet, sorry. - The guest bathroom is downstairs. - I prefer the other one. How does she know? [breathing heavily] WE'RE HAVING A BABY [inhales deeply] [sighs] - Should I check on her? - How should I know? Hey, calm down. - It's no big deal. - I've been up since 7.00 a.m. We still need to eat, and there's a stranger upstairs. [Alessio] Hey. Dinner isn't ready yet, but if you're hungry... we have these. [Anna] No, thank you. They're delicious. The house specialty. Trust me. [Alessio exhales] - It's good. - Uh-huh. If you tell us where you live, we'll take you home. I don't live here. Ah. So, what are you doing around here? I... came to visit my mother. - We'll take you to her. - No! Because, um... she's in the hospital. They hospitalized her today, and... Ah, I'm sorry. [Anna] Mm. - But you have somewhere to sleep? - Not right now. Where's your father? He travels a lot... Last I heard he was in Africa. Ah. - South Africa. - No less. [Anna] Mm. [breathes deeply] But that was a long time ago. He may not be there now. Yes. The water's boiling. [exhales] - [whispers] Shall we let her sleep here? - Huh? No. Can't you take her to the Bellavia? [Alessio] The Bellavia? Elisa, honestly, she seems a bit confused. It seems harsh to send her away. Do what you like. [footsteps approaching] I put her on the sofa. Fine. I'll take her straight to the hospital in the morning. No, you have to leave at 8:00. I'll take her on the way to the agency. Hey. Huh? I was thinking that since you can't come... maybe if you wear this here, you can still bring me luck. [whimpers] Hey... What's wrong? - Did I say something wrong? - [sighs, sniffles] It's nothing. - [chuckles] - Eli... You're worrying me. It's lovely. I'll definitely wear it. [dramatic music playing] Listen, Eli... while I'm away for a few days, why don't you call someone to come and give you a hand? A hand with what? With everything. To drive the car, to go get groceries. I don't want to leave you alone. I don't need a caregiver. [Alessio] That's not what I said. Spend a few days with one of your friends, with Patrizia, with Marianna, with whoever you want. [Elisa] Alessio, please. [faucet running] [Alessio] Why? Did I say something strange? - [Elisa] I've already answered you. - [Alessio] You've already answered. Let's try to call your cousin. Still going on? If I need her, I'll call, OK? Enough. [Anna] Good morning. - Good morning. - Morning. - I made coffee. - [Alessio] Thank you. All right, then. I'll stay here. I won't go. [Elisa] What are you saying? [Alessio] Yes, Elisa, there's no point in my going if I spend the whole time thinking about you here alone. You're pregnant! I'll call Mauro and get substituted. Mauro? But it's the final. I can't stand you when you're like this! - Look, it's only two days. - You don't think that's much? I tell you what, she can help me. Hmm? Want to stay here for a couple of days? - [Alessio] Her? - [Elisa] Yes. You said whoever I want. - Do you have a driver's license? - Of course she does. [car starts] [gasps] What are you doing? Uh... [engine revs] The gear! The gear... [Elisa] Like this. [gasps] [sighs] OK, get out. I'll drive. - My car is different. - Yeah. Where are we going? I'm taking you to your mother in the hospital. Aren't I supposed to take you to work? Listen, thank you, but I really don't need anyone. Have you got any money? Bye, then. Sorry again for yesterday. [melancholy music playing] Elisa? [gasps] They set you up, huh? [chuckles] I'm Carla. Don't you remember? Carla Capitani. You found me the interpreter job. - Carla, of course. - [Carla chuckles] I don't work there anymore. I teach English at night school now. Remember I was looking for a chair? No, I don't remember to be honest. It came. Why are you here? Are you with the Great Bastard too? Who, sorry? The Great Bastard, the king of the gatecrashers. I've had it here... for almost a year. I'm sorry. What can you do? He grew to like them. Can't say I blame him when I've got tits like these! [chuckles] He'll soon get tired of mine then! - [laughs] - [chuckles] How long have you known? Since yesterday, but I'm still really confused. [inhales] I still haven't told anyone. Well, let's do that now. - Hello, everyone. - [all] Hello. I see some new faces. Yes, but my friend would prefer not to talk for now. Sure, as you wish. - Where have you been, Carla? - [Carla] Did you miss me? - Oh. - [woman laughs] [Carla] Something came up at work... with a student of mine. What kind of thing? I slept with him! - Well done! - [Carla laughs] Was he at least an adult? Given how talented he was with his tongue, I'd say so. It all happens to her. [laughs] All right. Is he the one you told us about last time? No, this was someone else. I'd never thought about him. It is still psychological support, though. In fact, I was thinking of you the whole time. - Of course you were. - [laughs] [knock on door] Yes? Sorry. [man] Are you looking for someone? Um... my mother's in the hospital here with a tumor. They told me I could come and join you... Of course. Come in. What's your name? - Anna. - Anna. And who's your mother? She was admitted yesterday. She's in intensive care. And your father? Are you here on your own? Mm. How? Where will you sleep? [Anna] I don't know. If you're hungry, my husband owns a pizzeria less than a mile away. - [woman 1] And we have a bar. - [woman 2] My parents have a spare room. I can ask them if you like. OK, ladies, don't overwhelm her. Do you really not have anyone here? No, but I don't need anything. I'll be fine if I can find a job so I can get by. She runs a temp agency. [keyboard clicking] Why haven't you told Alessio? What did you say your name was? - [exhales deeply] Anna. - [Elisa] Surname? "IF YOU WANT TO LIVE A HAPPY LIFE, SET A GOAL" - OSVALDO GIROTTO - Girotto. - [Elisa] Do you have any ID? Uh... I think I left it at home. You don't have a license? - No. - OK. How old are you? Seventeen. No, sorry... Eighteen. You can't smoke here. Yes, sir! [Elisa] OK, there's an event at the golf club tonight. And we want to miss it? The president's son is getting married. The catering team is full, but I think they could use another person. [inhales] What size do you wear? [chuckles] I don't know. Stand up. I'd say you're a two. Do you have any other shoes? Because these are no good? It's not their style, no. And what is their style? Like yours? Yes, better. OK, so let's swap. Go on, I'll bring them back. What's wrong? Worried I'll steal them? Thanks. [Elisa] It's my job. Yes, but it can't be easy for you. Nor for you. [Alessio over phone] I asked for a hotel without TVs in the rooms so they'd go to bed early. Instead, there are huge screens. Oh, well, they aren't kids. [Alessio] Sure. Did you put the shirt on? Of course. I'm wearing it now. [Alessio] Great, thanks. I feel close to you. What else? We were going to bed. [Alessio] OK. I'll leave you to it then. Good night. - Good night. - [Alessio] Good night. - Love you. - Me, too. THINGS TO DO [doorbell buzzes] Thank you. You could've given me them tomorrow morning. You've already finished? Yes, there was nothing left to do. May I? My shoes. I'll go and get them. How did it go? Well. Same old pain in the ass. - Problems? - No. I just hate weddings. Everyone beautiful and smiling... It's too much. - Have you eaten? - No. I'm starving. Can I make myself some toast? [Elisa] I forgot to go shopping. I have some fish sticks in the freezer if you like. - No, I hate fish. - [Elisa] Well, then. [exhales] Isn't there anywhere nearby to get something to eat? There is, but you need a car. - [Anna] Can you take me? - No. Please! No. Put that down. Put that down. Hey! - What does it say? - Give me it. - Give me it! - Only if you take me. No! [scoffs] [car horn honking] [woman] Who's honking? What is she doing? [Anna] Aren't you eating your fries? [Elisa] Do you want them? If there's something you really like, do you eat it first or save it for last? I save it. We have absolutely nothing in common. Thank God! Give me your fries. Get down from there. Come on. Get down. I can't look. [sighs] This sandwich is foul. It tastes like a wet dog. [Elisa] I told you everything was closed. What did you expect? [Anna] Why didn't you go live somewhere else? Like where? You must've thought about it. No? OK, then. I thought about it once. I'd have liked to go to London. Why didn't you go? - Gotcha! You don't speak English! - [Elisa chuckles] Look, people go there to learn it. That's not why. I couldn't live in London. It's too big. I'm better off here. What's so great about this place? - There's nothing here. - How would you know? I can tell. Actually, there are loads of great things to do here. - Like? - Like... Like coming here. Here? - To do what? - [chuckles] - What do you think? - No way! [laughs] - With who? With Alessio? - [chuckling] Uh... Actually, this is where I got pregnant. So you made her here? No, not her. It was three years ago, but I lost it. What about her? She... In the garage. - In the garage? - [Elisa] Yes, in the garage. Fuck! - What's wrong? - I forgot my jacket. - OK, fine, you can wear mine. - My house keys are in it! God! OK. We can sort it out. Don't worry. Come on. - Some ID, please. - Sure. - Here. - Yes. I need your daughter's too. Of course. She doesn't have it. She hasn't got it because we locked ourselves out. Ah. OK. - Room 24. Second floor. - Thanks. Breakfast from 7:00 to 10:00 a.m. The elevator's on the right. Your daughter took the stairs. [water splashing] - Hey. - Where did you learn to dive like that? [Anna] I took a class. - Come on, get in. The water's lovely. - We can't. It's late. Who cares? Get in! No, get out! - I'll scream. - No! - Get in! - Shush. [Anna] Come on! All right, I'm coming. [Anna] Need a hand? No, I can manage. - Ah, it's cold! Ah! - [Anna] It's not cold! [Elisa] It's really cold! Oh. Ah! - [Anna] Admit that it's nice. - It's lovely. [chuckles] Can't you swim? No, I float. Look, I can do this too. Wow! She's helping me. It's wonderful. Admittedly, it's not bad. What's wrong? Oh. She moved. - Huh? - She moved! [chuckles] - [laughs] Did you feel it? - Yes! Oh, God! Oh, God. It's crazy. Feel how she moves. I need to pee. Are you nuts? Just kidding! [laughs] You have no idea how hard it was to find a bottle of water. 1.PAINT ROOM 2. BUY CRIB 3. CHOOSE PLAYSCHOOL 4. FIND BABYSITTER - [man] Here you go. Done. - [Elisa] Thank you. [chuckles] - [Anna] These are for the trash, right? - These too. What about this? It's from a concert I went to. Why are you throwing it away? She'd just think of it as an old shirt. I think she'd like it. Yeah? Put it there then. Listen, I was thinking about that diving class you mentioned. What if I gifted her one? - What do you mean? - If I gave her a diving course as a gift. - No, you can't. - No? - Sorry, but why not? - Because you don't know her! - You don't know if she'll like it. - I can picture it. And how do you picture her? How do I picture her? Blond hair... Alessio's brown eyes... but what matters is that she's beautiful inside. Inside? Yes, that she's a strong, determined person. A positive person. That especially. What do you mean by "positive"? - For example, someone who trusts others. - A fool? [laughs] No, an altruist. Someone who doesn't need to step over others to get what they want. Someone who gets pushed around? Is that really how you see life? What do you want, a daughter or a doll? She definitely won't be cocky and insolent like you. She won't be a photocopy of her mother either. [phone ringing] [beeps] Hello? Good morning. What do you mean "she left"? No, she didn't tell me anything. I'm mortified. I can assure you it won't happen again. Thank you. My apologies again. You're a liar too! That was the catering company's owner. He said you left without saying a word. No! Explain to me why you lied! What do you care? It was my job, not yours. Your job? Who found you that job? Who vouched for you? Do you have any idea how hard I worked to gain my clients' trust? What do you care about your clients? You have a tumor! They were shitty people. I didn't even want to be there 'cause my mom's sick. [sniffles] [car arrives] [door opens] [door closes] [footsteps approaching] [Alessio exhales] [kisses] Soccer really is a shitty sport. You set yourself a goal, you spend the whole season working towards it, you evaluate all the scenarios, calculate the odds, you study your opponents, and then what happens? In comes that stupid dickhead Tasselli, the worst right-back in the world. And he's on your team... Alessio. - Tasselli, when there's a corner... - Alessio. - ...doesn't stay there... - Alessio! What's up? [kisses] The other day I went to the hospital because I was bleeding. - Is there something wrong with the baby? - It's a girl. [chuckles] - Really? A girl? - She's fine. She's fine. No, it's me who... What? [stammers] I have... I have a tumor. Breast cancer. [breathing shakily] [whimpers] [breathes heavily] Why didn't you tell me sooner? You had the final. [doctor] I've consulted the MRI report, and, unfortunately, I can confirm my colleagues' diagnosis. It's an advanced metastatic triple negative. Unlike the hospital, however, our clinic adopts an experimental protocol, which has demonstrated a 30% increase in effectiveness in some cases. [Alessio] When could we start? [doctor] Well, the sooner the better. In your case, treatment would have to be postponed until after the pregnancy. [clicks tongue] Unless you decide to have an abortion. Are you asking us to choose between our daughter's life and mine? No, I'm just explaining your choices. [inhales deeply] And with this new protocol... what recovery rate would we be looking at? Essentially, in cases like this, it's just to... slow it down. Slowing it down as best we can. What do you mean by... "slow it down"? [inhales] This type of cancer can't be cured. - That's your opinion. - Please, Alessio. Who the fuck are you, huh? Who are you to sit there and decide who lives and who dies wearing this stupid tie, huh? Am I supposed to trust a guy like that? - Sit down. - [Alessio] We're leaving. Come on. [door opens] [Alessio] Yes. Yes, OK. OK, I'll call you tonight. But he's good, right? No, because the guy this morning... Don't even go there! [panting] She's here. I'll tell her you said hi. That was Mauro. He's getting us an appointment with Niguarda's physician, - in Milan. They're good. - [Elisa] Can we talk about this later? Yes, sorry. Sorry. [Alessio sighs] I guess you backed the wrong horse. - Don't talk crap, Elisa. - I'm sorry. Don't talk crap. I backed the best horse! Got it? The best horse in the world! Remember what the doctor told us when you couldn't get pregnant? - That was different. - Remember? That you can always do it. Always! And this proves it! - I won't see her grow up. - Shut up! Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. [crying] Please, shut up. We'd have been better off without her. [woman] At work, everyone knows I'm sick, but nobody says anything. They pretend. Perhaps to make me feel normal. [crying] Instead, they make me feel even sicker. - Listen, it's better if they pretend. - Yes, it is. Then you don't have to hear, "You're gonna make it." "Now you just need to rely on yourself." [chuckles] "Keep fighting!" That one beats them all! [laughs] [man] Maybe you should be the one to bring it up with your colleagues. [sighs] Maybe you can't because you're ashamed. We're all ashamed here. "Why me? What did I do wrong? Huh? Eat the wrong food? Passive smoking? The three times I used the sunbed two years ago?" The point is... [inhales] ...that there is no real reason. - We're just losers, that's all. - Nobody here is a loser, Carla. Not even you. Are you in a bad mood, honey? [inhales deeply] My student dropped out of class. What about you, Elisa? Did you manage to talk to your family? Alessio can't accept it. Maybe I can't either. But if I really only have a few months left... I have no time to waste. [chuckling] I still have a ton of things I want to do. I've written them all down. Maybe there's a few too many, but some of them, I'm sure. Such as? I want to leave my daughter some gifts... for her birthdays. Yes, I know it'll be a bit random, especially those for when she's older, but I thought maybe you could help me. Who here has kids? Don't you think it's a bit soon? You did just find out after all. [man] Ladies, Elisa didn't ask for our opinion. It's her choice, and it's justifiable. She's asking for our help. In my will, I've left everything to my cat. [woman] To a cat? [laughing] [Carla] To a cat. [chuckles] [laughing continues] [Elisa] Excuse me? Hello, Elisa. How can I help? I'm looking for someone, a patient who's being treated here. I shouldn't say... Oh, well. Go on, then. Name? Uh... the married name is Girotto. Girotto... She was admitted on the 21st. Oh, OK. The 21st... [church bell ringing] Hey! Can I come in? Sure. I was at the hospital. I looked for you and they told me your mother isn't there. She never was. She doesn't exist. - Why were you looking for me? - First, tell me why you're such a liar. Where is your mother? I've never met her. She left when I was born. And your father? Did you run away? I told you, he's in Africa. Anna! [sighs] Look, my dad's a loser, OK? We have nothing to say to each other. I can't go back to him, anyway. You ran away. Give me his number. I want to speak to him. Well? What's the problem? Drop it. ENGINEER BERRETTINI ARRESTED He's in prison! That's the problem. Wait. I have a job for you. This time, I'll hire you. But no more lies, no swearing, no controversies. What would I have to do? Help me choose her gifts. - What? - I didn't ask for your opinion. But why me? You said she'd never be like me. Because I want someone who won't just agree with me just because I'm dying. So, will you help me? [Anna] These? - No? - Stop it. What do you think? Nah! Drums are better. - [Elisa] Drums? - [Anna] Yeah, the piano sucks. - [Elisa] Drums for a girl? - So what? [Elisa] Enough! Give me those. Poor Alessio. That's torture. As if the piano isn't! Hours and hours alone in front of that damn keyboard when all her friends are playing outside? At first, you need to be dedicated, but then passion takes over. At eight years old? By the time that passion comes, you've ruined her life. So I should give it to her when she's older? No! I'm saying you should get the drums. And they're on sale. - [pipes whistling] - You've convinced me. Drums it is. - I'll get the bags. - Let's unload. Hey. Can you tell me where you've been? Your phone's off. Sorry, my battery died. They delivered a bicycle. We've been buying things for the baby. [Anna] Hi - Sorry, what's she doing here? - Giving me a hand. - Can you help me? - Yeah. I've been trying to reach you since this morning. I managed to move the appointment in the hospital in Milan to tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow! Why, aren't you happy? I made an appointment with a preschool director for tomorrow. I wanted to do that with you. Elisa, why are you doing this? Doing what, sorry? Disappearing, going shopping... Can't we face this together? - You really want to? - Of course. - Then help me! - Isn't that what I'm doing? No, it isn't, Alessio! You're talking to me about hospitals, doctors. I need to think about our future! Think about it how? By buying stupid bikes? Let me know when you have a better idea! Aren't you coming for dinner? No. You smoke? What do you think? Can I have one? How's she doing? Not well. But she's got balls. She always has. She's the strong one, really. We wanted this baby so much. We were going to get married next year too. And now... now it's getting this close, I find myself alone. You won't be alone. You'll have your daughter. Can you picture me with a little girl this small? What will I do? [Anna] Look, you're strong too. I don't think so. She told me you were. Really? - Mm-hmm. - She really said that? More or less. - But... - But? Show her every now and then. [woman] There are loads of possibilities these days. Yesterday, I read about a funeral company that turns your ashes into diamonds. - Yeah, you can have a ring made... - [woman 2] That's gross! [woman 3] I already feel claustrophobic. [man] Why not get cremated? 14. MAKEUP & PERFUME, 15. HI-FI 16. CAMPING GEAR, 17. TICKET TO LONDON [woman 2] Isn't it all the same in the end? [man] OK, see you next Tuesday. And don't forget to do your homework! - All right. - What homework? Smiling through life, some bullshit like that. I have other priorities, God willing. [Elisa] You don't know how many times I've thought, "I'll take six months off and start learning English." [Carla in English] English is always a good idea, darling. [in Italian] I don't want her to have the same regret. [Carla] You're a responsible mother. I can help you find a school if you like. I'd be happy to contribute... I'd like you to teach her. Is 12 a good age? Or is that too late? Maybe ten's better. What do you think? I don't even know if I'll make it to next year. - What are you talking about? - Listen... You're a brave woman. You really are. But I'm not. Sorry. I'll give you the details for that school. Bye. [door opens] [unintelligible chatter] [Alessio] Like you can teach me. Hey. It's not finished. We have to apply the second coat. [exhales] Listen... where did you want this to go? I was thinking, I don't know, that maybe it could go there. What's up? [laughs] [chuckles] No, come on, you'll get covered in paint! No! You'll get dirty. - [Alessio laughing] - Muah. [Alessio] Mmm. [both gasp] [both laugh] [Elisa] Thank you! Thank you! - [Alessio] Like it? - [Elisa] Muah. [Alessio] It needs another coat. [chuckles] No. Hey! Hey! Anna's here. Stop! You'll get dirty. [machine beeping faintly] [beeping intensifies] [heartbeat] [Anna breathing heavily] [Alessio] How is she? She had a severe concussion. We've put her into a medical coma. A coma? Don't worry. It's just a precautionary measure to reduce brain stress. But she's responding well. If the test results are positive, we will wake her up soon. [frantic knocking on door] Hey, where did you go? [chuckles] Oh, gently. Gently. What's wrong? Is everything OK? [kisses] Yes, it is now. [chuckles] How far along are you? What do you mean how far along? Eight months. [Anna] Eight months? Anna, are you sure you're OK? [Carla] Some hair straighteners, hmm? I'd want some. Hmm... I don't know. What does "Hmm, I don't know" mean? It's the last present. It has to be something special. You'll never find something this way. [Carla] And you? What do you think? What gift should she get her for her 18th birthday? Anna, can you please pass me that green jar? - [Anna] This one? - Yes. Thanks. [car horn honking] - It's bitter! What is it? - [chuckles] My secret ingredient. [grandmother] How much stuff did you bring? I think your parents are here. I think so too. They're a piece of work. - [Alberto] I've got sciatica! - Are they arguing? No, your mother is mostly just chewing out your father. I'll help with their bags. Can you see if the oil is frying? Sure. Yes. [Elisa breathes heavily] Now we have to fry them. Wait, let me get that. Ah, It's heavy! [chuckles] [Elisa] You try. [laughs] It's not hard. Take an apple... and put it in the batter. Do one side first... and then the other. Let the excess drip off. Then put it in the oil. Like this. One... two. And into the oil. Mind you don't burn. [Anna chuckles] [softly] Take an apple... put it in the batter... and then put it in the oil. Like this. Take an apple... You have to let it drip. Here. And put it in the oil. [chuckles] Like this. [Carla] Here we are! [grandmother] Can we come in? We're here, Mom. [grandmother exhales] - [grandmother kisses] - [Elisa] What were you fighting about? [Alberto] Fighting, us? Never! [kisses] You'll make me feel worse. - See? Are you happy now? - Me? I'm Teresa. Nice to meet you. This is Anna. - I'm Alberto, Teresa's husband. - [Alessio whistling] I'm home. We'll drink these tonight! No, we will drink these, because you're leaving tonight. - You can't sleep with the bride! - I know. I know! The bride? What do you mean? The young don't understand these things! In our family, the bride and groom can't sleep in the same bed the night before the wedding. [laughs] [crowd clapping and cheering] [man] Give it up for the newlyweds! - Shall we go in? - [Anna] Sure. [clinking glass] Excuse me. I'm a little nervous. Also because my wife is finally letting me speak after 40 years, - and I don't know how to anymore! - [guests laugh] General Dalla Paglia knew how to speak to the troops! Oh, no, he's back to the African war again! So, when you were born, Elisa, I was 26, and I thought I already knew everything. But... [chuckles] ...instead, you taught us so many things, and you're still teaching us so many things. Your mother and I... We love you so much. It's... It's something... that we never tell you, because we aren't exactly an effusive type of family. We're a family of toads. [guests laugh] But you know very well that we love you like crazy, and we will always love you. Congratulations. [cries] Congratulations to you, too, Alessio. Believe me, you're the luckiest guy in the world. [man] Bravo! [in English] Ladies and gentlemen. [in Italian] Excuse me. A moment of attention, please. I just wanted to say a couple of things. Elisa, Alessio, I promise they'll be harmless. [chuckling] Almost, anyway! I wanted to raise my second glass of wine, um... to this couple... to this enterprise, for your tenacity, determination, and love. Thank you for making me part of your family. [chuckles] You're the closest thing to monogamy I've ever had in my life! - [woman laughs] - And I promise it'll be the only one! [laughs] So, let's drink, let's dance, and let's all love each other! - [chuckles] - [scattered laughter] - To the bride and groom! - The bride and groom!

[Anna] "Memories: One: you always have them. Two: they make you long for the past. Three: you cling to them when you feel down. Four: they prepare the future." - [Elisa] They prepare the future. - OK. "Your favorite dress is worn, do you: One: buy a similar one? Two: think of all the great times you had in that dress?" [chuckles] "Three: have it repaired by a seamstress?" - [Elisa] Have it repaired by a seamstress. - OK. - I can't take another hour of this. - Come on, focus. We have to finish this. So...

Come on, there's only one left. - "You realize..." - [Elisa] I've thought about it. You could keep working for me. Hmm? You could give her the gifts. That way you can explain them to her. Why not? [sniffles] Maybe you'll give them to her. Because I always know how to manage, right? [laughs, sniffles] - Let's see what the doctors say today. - Yeah. [Elisa] Anyway, I've decided what to get her for her 18th birthday. Want to know? How beautiful! [Anna] Mm-hmm. What's wrong? You don't like it? It'll be out of style in 18 years. Oh, well... At least she'll be the most original of all at her party. What party? - She won't be having a party. - Why not? It doesn't matter. You've always thought this gift thing was a bit stupid, didn't you? You only did it 'cause you felt sorry for me. [Anna] It's not like that. Then why? - [Anna] Because I am your daughter. - [sighs] That's not funny. [Anna] Not to me either. [mournful string music playing] [music builds] Is it really you? Anna. [knocking on door] [woman] Excuse me? Have you finished? Just a moment. - [knocks on door] - [woman] There's a queue! [door opens] [woman 2] What's up? Worried that fuck ugly dress won't fit anymore? [Anna] Hey! What's happening? Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom! - [Anna crying] Wake up! - [clerk] Ma'am. - [Anna] Get up! - [woman] Ma'am. [Anna] Help! Ma'am? Call an ambulance! Go get help! You can't come. - Excuse me. - But... Mom! Mom! [honking] No! Mom! [siren blaring] [Anna] No! [heart beating on monitor] [Elisa panting] [Elisa] Open up... What? The door, she's knocking. Who is? The girl with the dress. Anna, our daughter. Honey... You were dreaming. - You were dreaming, honey. - [pounding on door] She's knocking. Can't you hear it? Elisa... it was a dream. That thing is making the noise. What was she like? Our daughter, what was she like? [Elisa] She was beautiful. Just like you. She had... dark hair... blue eyes... deep and very sweet. [Alessio] What size was she? Why do you ask? I got the gift. The dress for her 18th birthday party. The one you wanted. I got a size four. Do you think it will fit? [smacks lips] No, take it back. Why? [Elisa] Because it isn't... Because it'll be out of style in 18 years. I need something else. [Alessio] Calm down. - Where's my notebook? - Elisa. - Hey, calm down. - [Elisa] Get me my notebook. Listen, the doctor said you need to stay calm. OK? - You're giving birth today. - Today? Why today? Is something wrong? Hello, Anna. Your dad's come to get you. How are you today? Better. I brought you some clothes. I brought some jeans. Is that OK? Yeah, fine. - Dad? - Yeah? I'm sorry. [Teresa] Oh! Welcome home, sweetheart! Give me a hug! [laughs] [Alberto] Welcome home! - Grandpa! - What did I tell you? Oh, sweetheart! [laughs] Hmm? - Have you been fighting? - Yes! No, I told him to take the garlands down, but he... - No, leave them. They're pretty. - See? Come here, you little pest! I missed you. I missed you too. I'm going to finish cooking. [plays one note] [playing a sad melody] [melody continues] So, huh? Are you ready? [Elisa] You look beautiful. Thanks. - Have you already picked someone up? - Obviously. You, on the other hand, will need to close shop for a while! Right, Alessio? - [Alessio] Yes. - [Elisa chuckles] You can count on me. For the English. I knew you'd make it. [breathing heavily] She's gonna hate me. You're making me be her English teacher. You're impossible to hate. That's why I chose you. [nurse] I'm sorry, everyone. You need to clear the room. Yes. [Alessio sighs] [Teresa whimpers] Bon voyage! [Teresa] Don't worry, sweetheart. [nurse] Sorry. - [nurse] You can't come in. - See you later. - We did good, didn't we? - Yes. Yes... We did good. There she is. Let's go. Oh. Like this... OK, Elisa, let's sit up for a bit. Well done. Great job! We're ready. We're just going to give you a little injection so the baby will be calmer too. - Will you put me to sleep? - Yes, but only from the belly down. I want to see her. Of course you'll see her! You need to stay calm for now. Ready. Can I have some paper and a pen? - Now? - Yes. It's important. [nurse] Doctor? - What's wrong, Elisa? - I need to write something down. - And... can't we do it later? - No, now would be best. OK.

Just know that I'm asking the same constantly. There's no reason why. There's just life. And believe me, it isn't worth living it being angry or sad.

But you don't know how much good it's done me. How much strength it gave me to think of them, to think about you, and what would make you a better person. So, thank you, sweetheart. Sorry if I got some of the gifts wrong, but it was the only way I could feel close to you. I have to leave you now. You're a woman by now. You won't need my gifts anymore.

It's my gift. Well, mine... Your mom came up with it first. She had second thoughts about it, but I didn't really feel like taking it back then, you know? [exhales] Do you like it? It's beautiful. It may be out of style by now. - Who cares? - [chuckles] Try it on, though, because sizes then were a bit different. Thank you. - I'll wait for you downstairs. - Mm-hmm. Loads of people turned up.
