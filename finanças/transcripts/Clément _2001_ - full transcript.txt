Clement Get up. What time is it? Noon. I don't like it when you smoke. Oh no, I'm already two hours late. You don't like it when I smoke? Do you need your car today? Can I borrow it? Sure, no problem - Didn't you have an appointment today? - No, don't worry about me. Mathieu, pick up, it's Marion. Pick up! Hi, how are you? I have to go to the suburbs to Aurore's place, for my godson's birthday. I didn't wake up. You want to go with me? We could spend time on the road together, get some fresh air. Come on. Excellent. Ok, I'll wait for you on the boulevard. See you later. Wait. I recognize the field, but I don't recognize the road. You're came here 15 times already and you don't recognize the road? I remember the small little house behind some bushes. Mathieu, stop it! Stop, here! it's this one! it's this one! Stop! It's your fault, you didn't warn me soon enough. How could I see anything at that speed? I don't think it's funny. You know, I'm afraid of accidents. You have the IQ of a 15 year old. What could I do? You said to stop right as we were in front so... So you could've done a U turn a little further. You did this on purpose to scare me. You know I'm afraid of car accidents! Marion. - Well, are you coming? - No, I can't. I can't. I have to be in Paris before 5:00. I just came for the pleasure of traveling with you, but now I have to go back. You have to come, I don't want to go alone. It's out of question. - No, you're coming! - I told you I can't. - Mathieu. - No. - Careful, you'll get hurt. - Matthieu, stay. - I can't. - Then you'll come back tomorrow? - No. - Give me a kiss. - No. Nothing. Careful, you'll get hurt. - You're really something! - It's because my car got towed away. - What? - my car got towed away. And if it's not that, it's something else. You're incorrigible. - How did you come then? - Mathieu drove me. - Mathieu? - Yes. He'll be back tomorrow. He was in a hurry. He just came for you then. - And Frank? I thought you'd never come. - Come, I'll introduce you. - No, she stays with me. I want to introduce her. Okay. Stay with your Bernique. I'll go prepare dinner, now that you're here. What's a Bernique? It's those little sea shells. The ones that grip so tightly to the rocks, they're impossible to pull off. You got the message? I understood why she's upset. I never want her to hug me. But you, it's not the same. Sure it's the same. Come, I'll introduce you to my friends. - What is this game? - Sik End 3. Shit It's the one I bought you, you already have it. I don't care. You're my present. You've lost weight. And you've become quite observant. What made you lose weight like that? Woman. I think it was a woman. But I still lost 12kg. Know what I mean? - Do I know her? - No. But it's better that way. Two harpies together. - I'm not a harpy. What's her name? An awful name that I forgot. Was she beautiful at least? A little like you. Not too pretty. Sometimes very beautiful, but sometimes very ugly. Dad, did you make the coffee? - Wait, I'll help you. It's ok Marion. Yes, I made the coffee. You're still writing poems I hope. -You still have it? I thought it would be at the bottom of a closet by now. No. Also, I read it again recently. Take it. It was beautiful. It can't be the only one. You probably have tons of them. No. Just the one. I need it back actually. I'm preparing a book. You're crazy. Marion. Come! - I'm talking with your dad Come help me! Happy Birthday! - Where's my hat? - On your head. I left without telling you where the car was parked. Did you find it? I can't speak too loud, everyone is asleep. Yes. Some of Aurore's friends, adults. And a few of Benoit's friends. One of them is really funny, his name is Maurice. He's has some funny expressions. He always twists your words around to make it about sex. about sex. One of his expressions is " I swear on the head of The Thorn Birds" I don' t know. Maybe 12, 13 years old. Tomorrow? I don't know. I'll probably come back with Aurore. Okay. I'm going to sleep because I'm very tired. Okay. Good night. - Can't you make a little less noise? - No, we can't! Maurice. Maurice. Stop it! She can't breathe. She's asthmatic. Stop it, Maurice! Get away! Take your hands off! Enough. Clement. Clement! You ok? If you didn't have underwear on, we would've seen everything! - Luckily, you're not having your period. - Shut up. You always go too far. Cretin. If you say things like that, you'll get killed. She's not your girlfriend, that's all. You guys are crazy. Does it hurt? - No, it hurts the stomach, but... And there's blood too. There's blood. During menstruation, you bleed all the time, right? How long does it last? - For some women, it lasts 10 days. - For 10 days, they bleed from their vaginas? They bleed from time to time. - You bleed but you don't realize it, so it's from time to time. It's at the end of every month. - It could be anytime but every 28 days. When you're on your period, do you feel like constantly going to the bathroom? Not more the usual. It's very different. Blood doesn't flow out of the same place as your pee. - From a small hole? - No, not from a small hole. No it's where... It's where men shove.. the big one, to have kids. Are you frivolous? - Do your breasts grow bigger or something? It would be cool if breasts got bigger. I think the breasts get a little harder than usual. Hard like when you make love right? What? - Do girls get breast erections? - And do you get shivers? Girls get breast erections! I just have one question... No, that's it. I?ve had it. What's all that racket? We were talking quietly. I don't care! It's 1:00 AM! - I don't want to hear you! Ok, ok we're going to bed. A Kiss! A Kiss! No! Be quiet! That's enough! - Hey you saw that fat pig? What's his problem? Are you crazy? Can't you knock? - I'm sorry... I thought you were awake. That's not the issue! - What's wrong? - You don't just walk in, that's all! Come on, I'm your friend. - Get out, I don't want to see you. But Mathieu's here. - Who? - Mathieu. Get out of here, you! Go, she'll surely be happy to see you. They're so annoying! - They were interrogating me to know if we were together. - What's it to them? You came finally. What are you two talking about? - You went to the neighbor's looking like that? - Yes, so? Why? Does it bother you? - No, I'm not the one who looks ridiculous. Are we playing or what? Your fianc? is looking for you. - Yeah? which one? I have many. No, I'm just kidding. - Well, I don't care. - So what do you want? - I don't know who's your fianc?. - Nobody is. - You kidding me? It's Mathieu. - No. - So why don't you want to tell me? - I don't want to tell you something that is false. - So you have no one? - No one. I don't believe you. It's impossible that you're single. So don't believe me. But look at yourself you're also single. Yeah but it's not the same thing, I'm young. It's crazy how much Benoit's in love with you. Must be annoying sometimes, no? He's not in love, he's only 13. How do you know him? Are you in the same school? Yes, but I knew him from before. We used to play basketball. You're from Paris? You live in Paris? - Yes. - Where? Where I live? In the 17th arrondissement. Why? Do you want my phone number? And what do your parents do? Are you leaving tomorrow? - Yes. I'm leaving early tomorrow morning. - It's a pity. - What? It is a pity that you're not 13, or even 15. Are you ok, Marion? Yeah, I'm fine why? I don't know..You're very quiet all of a sudden. - Not at all. Hurry, up. They're asleep. " I hope to see you soon. Clement" - Hello. Did you know we were here? - No. - No, it's a pretty incredible coincidence. - Great, we're going to have fun. You'll see, she's a great snorkeler. - But you never come to this pool usually. - No, your mother to me you were here. And since I wanted to go the pool... I thought you'd be gone. - No, we have until 6:00. Look what I learned. Shit! What's the matter? Come. - You went to the pool? - Yes. We should get some fresh air. Would you like to go away this weekend, near the sea? I won?t be here this weekend. I had already told you. - I told you a week ago. - You're not going to leave me alone? - You're never alone. - Yes. This time, I'll be alone. We're never together by ourselves. Well it's too bad, but I'll still go. My ass hurts. Anyone want to change places with me for a bit? Sure, I'll switch with you. - Don't be a pushover Marion. - No, no. It's ok. - Who is that? - It's me. Let's do it together now. How do we do it? We lie against each other. Come, let's try. It'll go faster! Ok, it's my turn now. My turn! My turn! - Come, let's do it. - Leave me alone! There you are. We've been looking all over for you. - They want to go to a club tonight. Are you coming? - No. - But you like dancing. Come, it'll be fun. - No. Come on, everyone wants to go. We'll do the lambada like I showed you. Everyone will be disappointed if you don't come. Come. I want you to come. I said no. Thanks a lot! Now no one will go. The only reason you're only insisting is because you feel like going. Not at all. Why do you say that? I just want you to be there, it'll be more fun. - Come on. - Okay. I'll come, but I won't dance. Sure you will. What is this? These are children! No, no children allowed. But I'm an adult. - They can't come in. - But we're midgets, sir. Stop. You won't get in. - But look, he's got facial hair. It's pretty rough, You find that funny? Don't stand here. Other people are waiting, let them pass. - I don't care. Stand back please, people are waiting. You have no right to refuse us. Well, don't push. Bastard. Don't push, I said! Don't touch me! Did he hurt you? - Of course he did! you saw how he... Well, we can't get in, that's all. No I'm not the one who pounced on him. - You can't stand it when someone says no. Sure, okay, you're right. - They're idiots, what can you do? - Sure. Come on, I'll take you someplace to have a drink. - No. No I don' t want to! I want to go home. - I'll drive you. - No, I'll walk with them. All the neighborhood assholes got in, except for us. If I were taller, I would've kicked his ass! Not in 200 years - Shut up! Are you crying? You know, we're better off here than in a club. Look how he's clinging to her, the bastard! - You're an idiot! Hey Clement. This is my spot, stop. Quit it Benoit. Are we going to the house? - Are you cold? - Yes. You're trembling. - You're not going with them? - No. - What's he doing Clement? - Gathering sea shells. He's a buffoon. C'mon, he's gonna annoy us every 5 minutes. Who gets dropped off next? - I'll just get out here. - How come? You don't live here. - It's ok, I'll continue by foot.. - That's pretty far! - No, I'm not far away at all. - No, no I'll drop you. I can drop him off if you want. If it saves you a detour, my car is right there. I really don't mind. Sure. Are you sure it's no bother? Okay, see you. Bye. Wait. Where is your house? There, but I'll get there on foot. Why did you want to give me a lift? You see? I was right: you have a fianc?. Hello. Give me. Hello. No. Wait a minute. Yes. Well, if you want. Okay. - Who rang? - Benoit. Is he afraid of me? Quick let's go! before the others come out. If only for this, it shouldn't have come. I thought you wanted to tell me something. And you say nothing. - I do not know what to say. - Well then, goodbye. What are you going to do now? Do not want to come with me? Where are you going? - I'll go to the photo exhibition - No, thanks. I know, but I have to go there for a potential job. Funny. You're looking at this one. It's one of mine. Thank you. I saw your signature at the bottom. I can read. - So , do you like? - I do not know what it represents. That's the idea. So that everyone can see something different. For example, what do you see in this picture? Don't know, don't care. If you make a habit of bringing me to these places, I won't want to see you very often. I'm sick of it. Wait, what time is it? Mademoiselle, I need to talk to you. Well, later. Damn, I have to stay. - Can you wait? - No. Wait, I'll see you home and then come back. No, do not, I'll drive you and come back. - And how do you go? - On the subway. You're not mad? - See you soon. - I do not know. Why? - We don't have to meet alone. we could hang with the others - No, not that!. - What would you like then? I'd like us to leave together, At sea.

When I get good grades, everything is fine. And if not - it's terrible. And with whom you no longer get along best? With your father or mother? Well, I love them both. If they die, I'd be sad, but I can't stand living with them. I cannot sleep with them in the same house. I get stomach cramps sometimes Once I even almost puked. That's crazy. So you'd better study well. - You're in what grade? - In the eighth. - you good in school? - Yeah. - Can we talk about something else? - Okay. - What music do you like? - Any. - Rap love? - Yes.

Not Benoit? - No, are you crazy? ... Why have you talked about this? And what did they say? I do not want to repeat what they said. They laughed at me all day, idiots. I do not care. They're just jealous. Give me a cigarette. - I smoke when I?m not with my mother. - So you don't feel like puking then? You look like a fly. - What do you feel like doing? - I don' t know. And you? I'm up for anything. And what do you usually do with friends? Go to a cafe or an arcade. so you love strolling through the streets? - no I don't like it. I'd like to do something specific.

Goodbye Clement. Okay. Goodbye. Thanks again. Hopefully see you soon. How old were you when you first made love? - 15. - Fifteen? - Well, how? - What? - Well ... Tell me. - I've already told you. Who was it? It was a girl from my village. Her name was Natalie Lenoir. She was about 18 - 19. I was terrified. - Yes? - Yes. I had a friend, more experienced than I, who said that it is very simple. You simply enter the hole and move. What I did. I began to move back to here. My head is spinning. I do not understand. - And you stayed hard? - Yes. - Why? - Well, I don't know. Did you have normal sized penis at that age? I do not know ... I think it grows with you. And as it was compared with now? what now? Well ... was it the same size? I do not remember. Did you experienced pleasure? Yes, I do not really remember. None. Probably not. I came, but didn't enjoy it. At first it was painful. But the other times it got better and better. I started doing more and more obscene things. That I would talk about in details - To Who? - To friends. Really obscene things... - You, yes? - Yes. Yes, but the baby Lenoir liked it. - Well, tell me. - Wait. Something happened to me I. .. I. .. fell in love with a 13 year old boy. Why are you telling me this? - So that you tell me... - I don't want to be mixed up in your affairs. Keep your obscenities to yourself. This is not obscenity. Are you having sexual intercourse? No, but ... I just wanted to get this out of my head. I always about him. I see don't see him often, but when I'm not with him, I'm waiting. -I wait to see him. I wait till he calls. - And him? Him? I don't know. I do not know whether he is in love with me or not. I do not know ... Aren't you fed up of being all over the place? What are you going to do with this kid? Would you like it if I pulled up your skirt at this age? - He looks older than his years. - No, don't fool me. Go on then. Go get planted by 3cm penis! What do you want from me? What are you waiting for? Should I applaud you? No, swing your arms like this. - Thank you for calling me. - I do not even have your number But it is difficult, of course, to find ... - You're mean. - Are you jealous? No. But why did you bring Mathieu, huh? You're with him ... You're a whore. Listen, you don't talk to me this way. I'm not your little girlfriend. I don't have to tell you all about my life, okay? But since want to talk, I also have a few things to say. I'm telling you now. I don't want us to see each other anymore. I do not want to meet you. It would be better if we stop seeing. Enough silly things. I thought so. You're just a whore cockteaser. You have no right to talk this way, understand? Close your eyes. Come to me. - Are you afraid? - Not like last time. Don't be afraid. Clement. - Nine. You gotta go. - I don't want to go home. - What will you do? - I'll stay here. - It's impossible. - Why? - And your parents? - I don't care. And I don't care. You can't stay here. - I won't be here tonight anyways. - So that's it? Want to get rid of me? Come on, don't get mean. Go home and I'll see you tomorrow if you want. - Come on, get dressed. It's 9 - Let me go! Clement! Good morning, Monsieur. Sorry to bother you, you can open? - What is it? And what is it? Children with whom I walk, threw the ball over your fence. It's probably in your yard. - And, of course. And where? - It should be right there in the bushes. - I'll go look. - Thank you. I don't see the ball. Want to have a look yourself? Oh, no, no, do not worry. Sorry. - Thank you. Goodbye. -Have a nice day. Tomorrow is Saturday. Let's spend the whole day together. Go. It's a pity you don't have cable. See you tomorrow? - Are you expecting anyone? - No. - What are you doing here Clement? - I left my house. - How so? - I Ran Away. - Who is it, Mathieu? - It's ... a pal. - What were you thinking? - To live with you, spend the night with you. - Why did you do it without asking me? - I thought you'd be happy. How can I rejoice? This is nonsense. You're absolutely crazy. I can't hide you here anyways. - No need to follow me! - Come on, Clement. Where are you going? - to see someone who?ll be glad to see me. - Stop it. I am glad to see you. but think about your parents. - Don't mind my parents. It's my problem But they'll call the cops if you don't go back. - I don't care - Stop it. Can you imagine the mess that would cause? In the end, I can be put in jail. - It's you talking bullshit. - Clement. I want to stay with you. I also would like to stay with you. - No. No Clement. - Why? If this continues, it is unknown how it may end. - Stop it. Stop it. Even if you had a girlfriend your age, you wouldn't be allowed to sleep over. But you're not my age. Okay, enough bickering. I'll take you. - I have no money for a taxi. Do you? - No. I'll go for the car keys. Wait for me in front of the car. Over there: in the yard. I'll get the keys. I?ll hurry. Who is this boy? Marion, listen. If you don't explain, I will no longer be here when you get back. "Frank. I wouldn't know how to explain. I'm in love with this boy. I don't know where it's heading, but I'm heading there. In any case, I love you. Marion. " Marion, what are you doing here? "Clement, you remember that today I am leaving? I'm leaving today. Not for Long. I will call you every day. When I get back, we'll think of something. I'll miss you. But you will see how good separations after the meeting. Kisses for you. Just as hard as you like. " I called you so many times, you could at least pick up. I told you what times you should call. I know but I couldn't at these times. I?ll get you a cell phone when I get back. - Are you all right? - Yes. - What are you doing now? - I have to hang up. My father needs the phone Wait. Come to me. Come here. I gotta go. And then will call me? I doubt it. Ok, write down the phone number of the hotel where I'll be tomorrow. 04-90-36-29-61. - Got it? - Yes. I'd rather not be on the phone with you if you're like this. Call me when you want to talk to me. Ok, Bye. / busy tone / / phone call / Hello. No Alice, I don't feel like it. See you tomorrow I waited for you at the station. I know, but I had basketball.

If you want a pizza, take the children's menu. you're funny... Look at this. Helicopters. - Tasty? - Yes. - Wanna taste? - No. - What? - Nothing ... - What is it? - What? - You are doing it on purpose? - What? - Who did you call? - Matilda. If you must know everything. And who is Matilda? She's from my college. I love her. You're kidding me? Think what you want. Clement, what's happening? I want it to stop. This is because of the girl Matilda, that made you feel like this? What more will you find in her? There'll be other problems. She won't know how to make love to you. You don't know her. You even said: "I don't want girls my age. They can't do anything." Stop it! Get up, we're leaving. - Good-bye, Kitty. - See you this evening.
