There's a door that takes you to another dimension. Once you step through it, there's no return. l've already crossed it. Bye, guys. See you in school, Lori. Bye. l knew it was definitely gonna be a different birthday. That's just 'cause my dad's work had yanked me out of Beverly Hills High and then shipped mom and l down to Mexico City. l mean Mexico City for the rest of high school? The pits. Hey, man.

Come on. Hey, you guys, time to go. Oh, come on. Don't be a party pooper - Oh, come on. What's wrong? You don't do it because your mommy does it too much? l'm sorry. Hey you guys. Maybe he's right. We shouldn't play this game. Okay, Tony. Play, man. Play, man. Quit drinking, huh? Everyone ready? Virgil. Virgil. l would like you to meet some friends. Please show them that you really exist. Okay. What do you wanna ask? Ask him in what year my grandmother died. Yeah. Virgil, please tell us. When did Debbie's grandma pass away? This is crap. lt doesn't even move. Where's the ghost, Tony? This is bullshit. This is so stupid, Tony. You're such a liar. Yeah, Cristy's right. Yeah. Shut up, everybody. Wait, wait. Virgil. Virgil, l know you're here. Please answer me. Don't you feel it, Michael? lt's getting close to us. Help me to call him in. Hey, hey, hey. Tony. Tony. Why don't you cool it, all right? Yeah. This is crap. Hey, listen. l got a better idea. - What? - What? Why don't we ask the Ouija board, who's enchanted by Alexandra? Oh my God, it's moving. Looks like we have a candidate. Boo! Tony, cut the bullshit, man. Why don't you tell 'em who Virgil is, huh? Why don't you tell 'em Virgil is the devil? Okay. That's it. Everybody out. Come on. And Michael, l wanna have a word with you.

But ma'am... l'm sorry. Coming in late isn't acceptable. Please, ma'am. Hi. Hi. What's wrong? What are you doing out here? They didn't let me in my biology class. You overslept too, huh? Well, l guess. Listen, l don't think they're gonna let me in my class either, but would you like to have breakfast with me? But what if they catch us? l'll handle that. Don't worry. So? Okay. l had a great time. Me too. Bye. See you tomorrow. Bye. Shit, man. Told you that stuff is bad for you. You look like shit, man. What happened with your mom? Did she ground you? Nah. You're mad at me? No. Why? Listen, man. l'm sorry. l feel very bad about what l said about your mom's drinking problem. And don't think l forgot we had a promise. Not to say anything about the Ouija board. lt's just... A couple of drinks and... Guess what? What? Remember Alex, the new girl? Oh man. She's great. We went out to breakfast. She's incredible. l really like her, and l think she likes me too. But, jeez, l just don't know what to do about her, you know? Well, give her a rose. That's right. l'll give her a rose. Right. But not just any rose. What do you mean? Yeah. lt has to be the rose. The magic rose. Come on, man. Another one of your stories huh? No, l'm not joking. Listen. There's only one rose that can help you with that girl. And it's this one. Listen, if you really love her, then give it to her. And tell her that as long as love exists between you two, the rose will never wither. Hey, man. This is ridiculous. You look like a sissy. Come on. Tell you what. l'll catch you later, okay? All right, but please tell me what happens afterwards, okay? l'll do so. Hey, Michael. Good luck, man. Hey, Frank. Will you make yourself useful and get me something to drink? How about Coke? Okay, you got it. Hi. Hi. l just came because l don't wanna leave things like this. John is just my friend. You know him? He's just a smart ass. And he's also jealous of you. You know that. Michael. l love you. So, you love racing, huh? l love it. Speed is, l don't know, it's freedom. lt's a special sensation. lt's like, the more you get of it, the more you want it. l love your room. lt's fantastic. Michael. l want you to know that, this is the first time... - Sh! Alex. As long as there's love between you and l, this rose will never wither. Michael. Michael. Michael. Are you okay, honey? Open the door, Michael. ls something wrong? Please, baby. Just open the door. Michael. Michael, are you okay? Michael, answer me. Are you okay, baby? l'm fine, mom. Are you sure, honey? l'm fine. Good morning you little devils out there. lt's time to snap open those red bloodshot eyes and hit the road. We've a solid hour of uninterrupted music that will exorcise those morning demons away. lt's a sunny 78 degrees in the south land traffic... l'm standing inside the Cray-1 computer, the most powerful computer in the world. lt's also very large and has millions of wires as you can see. Don't tell me you're going to wear those glasses to school. Well, aren't you gonna take them off? Mom, it's sunglass day in school today and all my buddies are... Up until this point, this computer was used by the government, by the defense department, and now it is the first time that it's big used for graphics for film. - You crazy kids. This is the computer for which Ron Cobb designs his computer generated graphics. Michael. Michael. l need your help. Cristy's going to die... ...tonight Mom. Yeah. Michael, honey. Why don't you tell me what happened last night? Huh? Well? Mom, l gotta go to school now. l'm late. When you read Shelley's books, you must read every word and not lose any detail. Now, listen to this. Rose leaves when the rose is dead, are heaped for the beloved's bed, and so thy thoughts when love art gone, love itself shall slumber on. ls it the poet's character or maybe the romantic temperament itself? The heightened sensitivity or the inner vision of the poet? We will never know. But... Cristy Higgins is next, Michael. You must warn her. You must take her out of the city before midnight. Michael. ls something wrong? No, l'm sorry. And of all the romantic poets, Shelley was the most extreme. What finally pushed him over the edge from visionary to insanity? Oh, here you are. Hi, how are you? Listen, l'd like you to come over to my house tonight. l want you to meet my parents. Listen, l got a lot of things to do. Homework. Yeah, l gotta do some homework. Why don't we do this tomorrow? ls something wrong? No, no, no, everything's fine. l never thought you'd do this to me, but don't worry, l'll never bother you again. Alex, wait. You're just a filthy animal. l don't ever wanna see you again. - Alex. - Well, well well. lf it isn't crazy Michael. You don't really know how to treat a lady, do you? Oh, come on, man. Don't be so rude to Mr. Romeo. Oh, l'm sorry. Where's Juliet? Why don't you take those stupid glasses off and look at me straight in the eyes, huh? Hey, he's talking to you. Oops. Where do you think you're going, nerd? Hey, John. Come on. You shut up, okay? All right. Well, what else can you tell me about these visions you've been having? Well, besides my vision getting blurry, sometimes my eyes actually get red. All right. Well, button up your shirt. Go into the next room and wait for your mother. Well? Physically speaking, Michael is fine. The problem is psychological. At some point in his life, Michael must have suffered difficult experiences, which l'm afraid, are currently causing him these hallucinations. There's something you should know. l have a drinking problem. For the first time in your life, Fred, will you please listen to me? lt's not me that needs your help. lt's your son. Well, he's been having these weird visions, and the doctor even told me he should see a psychiatrist. Listen, Fred. l want you to come and see him right now. What do you mean next week? l can't believe it. l can't believe it. Your son is going crazy and you're telling me that you're too busy? Like l give a damn about your business. lt's your son we're talking about. All right, Fred. All right. lf you've got more important things to do, go ahead. Do what you want. But if something happens to Mike, don't blame me. Use the old science fiction device of thrusting us into a kind of a future devastated world. l really am fascinated by... Hello. Hello. ls anybody there? Hello. Alex, l'm sorry. You're acting like crazy. Shit! l'm not crazy. l'm not crazy. Yesterday night, Debbie White, a high school student, was murdered in her own home. The murder was committed between midnight and one o'clock in the morning. Her body was stabbed 13 times. This crime appears to have some connection with the slaying of Peter Fleming, a high school companion who was killed last night not far from here. Here we have Lieutenant Velazco, who's in charge of the investigation. Lieutenant, what seems to be the connection between the murders of Peter Fleming and Debbie White? Well, both victims were killed in the same manner. So that leads us to believe that one person is responsible for both crimes, you see? While the police department looking for answers, there is a murderer running loose somewhere in the city. Bob Wet... Come on, Tony. Pick it up, man. You must warn her. You must take her out of the city before midnight. Before midnight. Midnight. Midnight. Midnight. Cristy. John. Well, well, well, look, who's here. Mr. Romeo. ls Cristy here? What? Cristy, man. l gotta speak to her. Listen, fucking asshole. l'm getting sick and tired of you. What the fuck do you want with my sister, huh? She's in trouble, man. Yeah, she's in trouble. The only person who's in trouble here is you. Get the fuck out of here right now. John, you're gonna think l'm crazy, man. But someone wants to hurt her. Crazy man? No kidding. Just look at you. Just look at you, you lousy maniac. Get outta here. Out. John, you gotta save her. You don't fool around with my sister. You don't fool around with my house. You don't fuck around with me. Okay? Wait, man. John. They're gonna kill her, man. John. John. John, you gotta save her. Nurse. Nurse. l need to talk to Cristy Higgins. l think she works here. l'm sorry, but you can't come in without an authorization. Please, l gotta talk to Cristy Higgins. lf you want, you can leave her a message, but unfortunately you can't go inside. Front desk. Yes. Of course. l'll call you back. Security. Hey, watch where you're going. Sorry. Do you know where the lab is? Third floor. Left or right? Use the stairs on your right. Thanks. All right, kid. The game's over. Central, l've got our man. l'm at checkpoint two. Let's go, kid. Officer, you gotta help me. They're trying to kill someone in the lab. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about the lab? Cristy Higgins, someone's trying to kill her. Officer, you gotta save her. Right, l'll tell you what, kid. l'll call the lab and check it out, okay? Come with me. Okay. Stay here, okay? Please, get this young man out of here, right now. Let's go, kid. Leave me alone. Let me go. What are you waiting for? Nothing. l'm coming. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello! Leave me alone. No. You gotta save Cristy. Please listen to me. No! l don't know what made you think you could just walk in like that. What's going on? - l don't know. - Oh! Alan. Sam, you better get over here, fast. 10, four. Where are you going? Guard. Hey. Michael? Remember me? Tony? Why? Why are you running, Michael? l'm Tony, your best friend. Michael. What on earth are you doing there? Oh my God. Don't jump, baby. Come, darling. Please, baby. Give me your hand. - No, mom. - Come down. - Mom it's not what you think. - Oh my God. Are you okay? - l'm fine, mom. - Are you all right? You're not hurt? - Yes, mom. Oh, baby. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh, what happened here? Mom, it's not what you think. You gotta listen to me. You remember the visions l told you about? They're real. Tony, my friend, he's been killing people. Mom, you gotta listen to me. Tony. He's gone nuts. He killed Cristy, Debbie and then Pete. He's gonna kill me too, mom. You gotta listen to me. - Yes, l hear you, baby. - He's gone nuts. Yes, are you okay? Mom... - Are you okay? - l'm fine. Then stay right here. Don't move, and l'll be right back. Mom, listen to me. He's gonna kill me. l'll be right back, baby. Don't move. Shit! Dr. Warren. This is Mrs. Smith. lt's Michael. He's gotten worse. Can you come right away? Thank you. All right, Michael, this won't hurt too much. Why don't you just call the hospital? They'll tell you it's true. Calm down, Michael. Don't be afraid, you'll see, son. Everything will turn out all right. Calm down, but l don't want that in me. Come on. That's it, Michael. You have to have it. You need it, baby. Come on. Take it easy, baby. Calm down. Will you roll up his sleeve, Mrs. Smith, please? That's it, baby. lt's gonna be okay. Now this won't hurt you if you don't move. Just bend the arm. That's it. Mom. l'm scared. What are you scared of, darling? He's after me. He's gonna get me. Don't worry, baby. l won't let anybody hurt you. l came as soon as l could. How is he? He's fine. He doesn't need you anymore. Wait a minute. Don't blame me for your mistakes. lt's your fault Michael's the way he is. How do you expect anyone to be sane living with an alcoholic? lf you would have let him stay with me, he would have grown up to be a normal human being. Just look at this. No wonder Michael has problems. You wanna hear something? You've never been here when Michael needed you. He doesn't have a father and he knows it. What do you mean he hasn't got a father? l've kept my end of the bargain. What about all the money l've sent you? l bet you spent every God damn cent on booze. Here's your goddamn end of the bargain. We've never needed your money. Come on. Get up, you bastard. Come on, wake up. Hey. Oh, shit. You're so damn proud. You won't even spend the money for Michael's good. You think that money makes you a father? Huh? You couldn't even make it for his birthday. l have my responsibilities to the corporation. What the hell do you expect me to do? Drop a million-dollar deal, just to come here to a birthday party? You'd like to see me fail, wouldn't you? l'm tired of all your stupid excuses. lt looks like you're never gonna show any love for your own son. Good morning, Michael. l brought you breakfast. You're going to feel great when you eat this. Michael. Michael. John. What's wrong, man? Dying time, wimp. Take it easy, man. Okay, you bastard. Before l blow your brains out, you're gonna tell me how the fuck you knew someone was gonna kill Cristy. l had a vision, man. That's what l tried to warn you about. l tried to help her. Yeah, to help her? Who the fuck is gonna save you now? You went to the hospital and you killed her, mother fucker. lt wasn't me, man. lt was Tony. Who the fuck is Tony? Tony Ramirez, man. l don't believe you, you fucking liar. Come on, man. lt was Tony. Oh yeah, sure. Shit. Kill me then. He's gonna kill more people, dammit. These are his photographs. Something else? He was wearing his pajamas. He had no shoes on. There's nothing missing from his closet. He was under heavy sedation. l don't know how he could go anywhere. Mrs. Smith. Yes. Can l have a word with you? l'm Lieutenant Velazco. Listen, last night, a boy that fits Michael's description was seen at the Central Hospital. And the officer stated that he tried to warn them about a possible murder, but unfortunately they didn't believe him. So a few minutes later, Cristy Higgins, an 18-year old girl was murdered there. You go first. Shit. Don't you think we should let the cops handle this? Where's the motherfucker? Nerd, l'm talking to you. l don't know, man. He's not here. He's not in, huh? Well, it doesn't matter. This baby and l are gonna be waiting for him right here. Alexandra. Yes. l'm Lieutenant Velazco. Listen, l'm looking for a guy called Michael Smith, and you know him, right? Yeah. He's my friend. Why? Well, Michael is in trouble and l'm trying to help him. So l thought maybe you could tell me where he might be. All l know is he hasn't come to school in two days. Two days. Huh? Well, listen. lf you happen to come across anything that you think could help me find him, would you please call me? Yes, l will. Okay. Thank you. Hey, nerd. Get me a beer. Come on. John. What? Do you believe in supernatural? Of course not, come on. lt's how l found out about your sister. l had a vision where she was killed. Bullshit. So you call bullshit? l don't care what you say, man. We're in the middle of this shit. And that's bullshit. l'm not gonna stick around here. Hey man. Shut up, okay? You got me nervous. So don't talk about that thing, okay? Jeez, man. Michael. Remember the Ouija board? Virgil is doing the killing. Michael. This time you have to stop him. Don't fail. Robert's the next to die. What the fuck is that? Find Virgil. Take the dagger and use it to kill him. Who are you? What do you want from me? l'm Tony, and l need your help. You're not Tony. Tony tried to kill me yesterday. No, it wasn't me. What you saw was only my body, possessed by Virgil. Somehow, he has taken control of my body. lf you're Tony, prove it to me. All right. lf you really love her, then give it to her, and tell her, as long as love exists between you two, the rose will never wither. Hurry up. Robert needs you. Okay, Tony. Okay. Find the dagger, and be careful. The eclipse is more powerful than you know. Come on. We gotta go. Wait. Do you know how to use this? We're in this together, man. This door shouldn't be open. Robert. l guess we got here too late, huh? So? ls he dead? He's drunk. Let's get him outta here. Come on. Hey, man. What's the trip? Where are we going, man? Hey, whoa, man. Where are we going, man? Hey. Hey, man. What's going on? Where are you taking me, man? Shut up. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Where are you guys taking me, man? Cool down, Bobby. No, no, no. l wanna know right now, man. l don't even have my fucking pants on, man. Look, it's freezing. Shit. Shut up, man, or l'm gonna kick your ass. Get in the car. Okay, okay. lt's cool, man. l got a better idea. l'll go get my pants then l'll be right back. Listen to me. You get in the car. John, John. Calm down, man. Calm down. l'll get his pants. - Okay, okay. - Cool it man. - Shut up. You get in the car or l'll shove you in the damn car. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. - Come on, get in. All right. You should've asked me that in the beginning. Get in the car. Shit. Shit! Look, stay right there. Don't move, okay? Shit head. Don't shoot. Don't shoot, man. l got no money. Hey, thanks a lot. How much do l owe you? lt's nothing, man. Great. Thanks again, man. John. John. John. John! John, get out of the car, man. Shit! John! Watch out. Get out of the car. He's in there. Hurry. Do you believe in Satan? What's going on? Where is he? John, he's there. Where? Get over here. l can't. l can't see. l don't see him. Be careful. Where is he, goddammit? Hi, Johnny.
