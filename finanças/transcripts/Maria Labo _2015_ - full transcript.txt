It was based on a true story of an overseas Filipino worker. Who worked in the Middle East, and comes back in the Philippines. When she came back, she came home with a psychological problem with her, that resulted to the killing. It even became a police concern. Could you imagine, the class is suspended in a school because young children are talking that Maria Labo was there, that Maria Labo is going to attack the school? When I saw the storyline and script, I was surprised. I told myself the story of Mary Labo. If the radio drama was able to gather or earn the respect of radio listeners at that time. I know and I believe that the movie version of the story is going to be a hit. Mom, mom. Oh, my children. Mom, we've been calling you. I haven't heard. Why? What do you need?

Boys or girls? A boy and a girl. A boy and a girl. You know, we're having a hard time right now, especially financially. Here, here. You want me to give you the address of the recruitment agency? You might want to try it. I don't know. I hope my husband would let me. I know he will approve on this. Anyway, I'll try my best to convince him so he would let me go. Here. I hope we can go together. -Here's the address. I hope we can go together. If you really want, just let me know. We never know, we Might go there together. I really want to go with you. So.. Don't leave me there, okay? Of course. I hope Ermin would let me. I know he will. No. Gosh. I can't really stand the poverty here in Philippines. Let's eat. CBC Recruitment Agency 47-62-59 Hon, I'm here. Hey, hon. You're too early. You seem to be lost in thought back here. Do we have a problem? Nothing. I have a headache. So my colleagues let me leave early so I can take a rest. Hay. Come on, tell me what you're worrying about. You won't be like that if you're okay. I saw Emily earlier. My best friend in high school. She wants to go abroad. Is that it? Tell Emily to be careful there. There's a lot of bad things happening abroad. I just thought. We have a lot of debts already. I want to help. For our daily expenses. But I am working for us. You never know, on the coming days, I might get promoted. I'll have an increase. Say that again, Ermin. Until when? The kids are getting older. Our expenses are getting bigger. Shit! When should we do something about this? When we're already swamped with debts? We can't even eat three times a day. That's why I'm working hard. There are other ways, if you really want to earn money. Just stay here. No! I want to try it! I will apply, Ermin. Dad? Are you two fighting? Why, dad? Is there a problem? Nothing, kids. We were just talking. Kids, go to your room for a while. Go change. Your clothes are sweaty. Ermin. I'm sorry. I'll think about what you've said. I hope you'll support my decision as well.

Dad, dad. What happened? Mom. What happened to you guys? Mom. Ermin, what happened to our children? What happened? Ermin! I saw them in the middle of the street, having a fight with other kids. I just defended Rosalinda. Mom, they're teasing me. Because my bag is too old. Why can't you buy me a new bag? Mom, dad? Ermin. You see what happened? Even the kids are now affected. It was just a bag. We can buy her a new one. Hon, try to understand our situation for now. We can get through this. It wasn't just about the bag, Ermin. It's our entire life. Please let me go abroad, hon. Please, hon. I won't let you go there. Wait for me to find a way. Don't consider it as our only option. Don't rush. But.. just let me go, hon. Please, hon. We really need to do this. Please allow me to go. Ermin, this is the record that you've been looking for. Thanks. Hello, good morning. What? Where's this? Okay. We'll be right there.

Give me what I want. If not, I'm going to kill her. Give me what I want. Put her down. Come on. So, what now? Sir, my wife is sick. Mister, please spare this woman. Bro, we can give you what you want. It's just easy. We can give you what you want. Just put the knife down. Sir, my wife is in the hospital. Bro, we can give you what you want. It's just easy. Why did you shoot him? Mister, that is enough. I can't understand you, you know it was an accident, right? An accident, huh? They’re going to blame us, too! Stupid. You always… You're such a show off. It wasn't like that. You saw it, he's about to kill the hostage. So you see what happened? You killed my father. You don’t have a conscience. He just wanted to save my mother. How can we survive now? Where can we get our food? How can we live? You seem to be fine, why do you still want to work abroad? You look well off. You know, I almost got married. Oh, what happened? With rich guy. So what happened? We just didn't end up together. Why is that? Never mind. I also thought my savings wouldn't be enough. So I decided to work abroad. Wait, did your husband already agree? That's my surprise to you. He already allowed me to work abroad. You know, we have a lot of expenses right now. That's why I really want to work, so I could help my family. You can now help them. When you start working there, you can totally forget all of your problems. Really? Yes. But you'll be there as well? Yes, we'll go together, hopefully. Don't leave me there. Of course I won't leave you. By the way, the agency is just right there. After you get your hair done. No, I don't have to.. We'll go there. I'm nervous. Don't be. I'm excited but nervous at the same time. You can do this. You can do this. Okay, just relax. Okay, I'm just too excited. Ms. De Guzman.

I just want to ask, sir, I just have one employer right? Yes, you will be handling everything. You will be taking care of the house, too. I can do that, sir. I have another question, sir. I think I know what you want to ask. Don't worry, your place of work is just near Emily's assignment. Really? Thanks again, sir. You still have one month to prepare. Just to remind you. Yes? You need to review the rules which can be found inside your envelope. Yes, sir. Thank you very much again. Okay then. Come on, let's celebrate. Let's eat here. Wait, Emily.

Thank you. Maria, let's go. You just have one month before you leave? It's too soon. You just applied, was it even possible? I'm also surprised. Maybe it's really like that. Maybe they lack of caregivers, Ermin. At least, I already have a job. And the pay is good. If only I can do something about it. I really don't want you to leave. Mom, we're going to miss you. Wait, mom, do you really need to go? Me too, mom, I'm gonna miss you as well. Mom, just don't leave. Please, Mom. I'll just eat your vegetables. It will be my favorite dish from now on. Mom, me too. It's my favorite dish as well. You can serve it every day. Yes. I'm going to miss you too, my children. But we have to do this. I still have a month before I go, why are we crying now? Do we have an update about that new case? None yet, just prepare your asset. I'll be in charge of that. Here's another one. It's Miss Obligation. What's this again? It's always like this. When can this be over? Shit. We're not even earning that much, but we're cutting off our pay for this. It's already there. Let's just try to understand. This will be over soon. Please try to understand, we just really need this. Stop moping, I've already deducted it from your salaries. I'll just hand it over to her. Okay. Just get it from him. Children, this is for you. I'm already full. -Thank you, mom. I'm already full. And this is for you. Are you happy? Yes. Mom, here. Too much. You're gonna make your mom fat. Come on, bathe. Mom. Mom, where are you? My child, I want to give you something. This is a secret, okay? What is it, dad? This is what I want to give you. Wear this, my child. I want you to take care of this. Love you, my child. Brother. Hey, Rosalinda. Chase me. Enough. You're cheating. Chase me. Hon. Are you okay, hon? Yes, hon. I feel scared until now because of what happened. Because me and Emily promised that we will take care of each other there. I think you can no longer back out because you've already signed a contract. You're right, hon. Even though I don't want to leave, I have to. It's okay, hon. Just take care of yourself. I love you very much. I love you, too. Dad, mom. Your mom will leave soon. Mom, don't leave. Please, mom. Oh, my children. I need to do this, for us. There's nothing I could do. Mom, can we accompany you to the airport, mom. Please. Yes, mom. So we can stay together just for a little while. Somebody will accompany me to airport. The company has a shuttle bus so they'll be the one to send us there. We will see each other again. Ermin, our kids, take care of them. Don't worry. Rosalinda, Pablo, Ermin, I'm gonna miss you all. Take care of each other here, mom won't be here. Look after our kids, Ermin. Please be good, Rosalinda. Take care of your dad.

I'm an honest person. I'll do everything so you won't get disappointed. Peace be unto you. This is Maria Dela Cruz. A caregiver from the Philippines. Hello. I've been waiting for you. Come in. So Maria, I'll take it from here. Thank you. Take care. -I'll go ahead. Thank you. Take care. I'll be going, sir. Thank you. Sit down. Thank you, sir. Sir, I don't see anyone with you here, sir. Yes, I'm living here alone. While my family is away and my wife died. Oh, sorry to hear that, sir. I think I don't have to introduce myself anymore. You have all my files. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. You're welcome, feel at home. Excuse me. Rosalinda. Pablo. Ermin. My kids. Ermin. Hello, police station. Yes, wait for a while. Bro, you have a phone call from your wife. Thank you. Hello, hon.

I'm sorry, I should've introduced myself, I am Leng. My name is Maria. May I ask? Are you a Filipina also? Yes. Me too. I'm happy to know that I have a fellow citizen in here. Are you done, sir? I saw you talking to the girl lives next door a few times now. Oh yes, sir. She's visiting here lately. She's a Filipina. Maybe that's why she is talking to you. What do you mean, sir? I saw her working there for few years now. She's not been talking to anybody. Maybe because she came from the same country. Maybe, sir. Excuse me, sir. It is hard to wake my boss up, sister Leng. He's having a good sleep, lately. Good for him, he's sleeping well. Unlike you. You look like you're not sleeping at all. This is how it is, sister Leng. Maybe, it's because I'm not used to being away from my family. I can get homesick. Really? Maybe it's hard for you to be here. Good thing I can talk to you. Somehow, I have someone from the Philippines that I can talk to. How about your family? Aren't you missing them? Honestly, I don't have children. Maybe that's the reason why I feel comfortable with you. I see you as a daughter. What about your husband? He's gone, and please don't ask what happened. Sorry, sister Leng. Very fit, I like it. You have medium? No? Yeah. You have medium? No? Miss, I'll order. I will just choose a dish. Ma'am, is it dine in? Or for takeout? Dine in. Hey, fellow citizen. It's the first time that I saw you here. Don't you have a day off? Yes, my boss is sick. That's why. I can't go on a rest day. I see. Later, can I use your phone? I'll just contact my family. Alright. I'll use your phone. -Just come inside then. I'll use your phone. Call to Philippines, .80 Fils per minute. Miss, I'll use the phone now. Okay. What do you want? Dine in? Takeout? Yes, dine in. Here's mine miss. Hello? -Hello, Ermin? Hello? Hon, good thing you called. How are you? I'm lonely. I'm sad because I really miss you guys. Hon, just don't overstrain yourself. Okay. Be careful there. I need to go. I'll just call you again. -Okay. Be careful. I need to go. I'll just call you again. Bye. So, bro? You're happy now? Can you go to the groceries please, and buy me these things. This is the money and this is the list. Thanks. Okay, sir. Yes, sir. I'll go. Huh! What is this? Who are you? Animals! No. No. Please. No. No, please. No. No. What happened to you? Are you hurt? Come with me. Where's your ID? How's the patient, nurse? Doctor. Vital signs are all stable. It's a mental disorder. I would recommend to send her back to the Philippines. Oh yes, doctor. Okay, nurse, I'll be going. Yes, doctor. Hello, police station. Can I speak with Sergeant Ermin Dela Cruz? Yes, who's this? I'm the secretary of Dr. Lara Gutierrez. Your wife is here. Where's that? At the provincial hospital, sir. Alright. Bro, I'll go ahead. Okay. Ma'am, this is Maria Dela Cruz. Maria Dela Cruz? I'll call the doctor first. Thank you. Hello, doctor. Maria Dela Cruz is here already. Okay, thank you. Maria Dela Cruz? For monitoring. Consultation room. Miss where can I find Dr. Lara Gutierrez? Oh, Dr. Gutierrez? Wait for a while, sir. Sir, may I have your name? It's Ermin Dela Cruz. Doctor, it's Mr. Ermin Dela Cruz. Thanks. Sir, she's in room 205. That way, sir. Thanks, miss. Okay. Room 205 What happened to my wife? Why is she like that? We still don't know what happened. We just received a call from Saudi embassy, she's been deported. They assigned us to take care of her. Because she's already becoming a threat to that country. What shall we do, doctor? I think we should observe her for the meantime. Thank you. Dad, is mom already in the Philippines? Yes, but we can't see her for now. Why? It's been a while that I haven't seen her. Your mom is still recovering. She's sick? Let's visit her. Not at this time. It's better to visit her once she totally recovered. Okay? What is the question number 5? Are you done with your homework? Doc, how's my wife? Her case is extraordinary. She can't remember a single thing. I'm sorry to say. But I think she can't even recognize you. That's not possible, doctor. What can we do? We are doing our best. But there's one more thing. She's becoming aggressive. Can I make a request, doctor? Can I bring her home? So her family can take care of her. If it is possible. We really miss her. Maybe she'll get better, if she's with us. Okay, sir. But you need to sign a waiver. Thanks, doctor. Kids, your mom is here. -Pablo. Mom is here. Mom is here. Here she is. Mom. My children. I miss you. Mom. How are you? Mom. Mom. I miss you. We thought you will never come back. Mom, don’t leave us again. I'll prepare a nice dish for you, my children. I'm glad that we're all together now. Mom is really a good cook. Mom, this is delicious. I wish it’s always like this. This is what I've missed most. Your great cooking, hon. The best! Don't worry, children. From now on, I'll be the one to prepare your food. Eat well, my children. Eat, hon. Hey, brother, what's that? Rosalinda, don't take it. Let's go. What now? Pablo! Rosalinda! What now? Come on. I don't want to share. You're too selfish. Come on, Rosalinda. I don't want. Rosalinda! Mom, we're sorry. Pablo! Rosalinda, please. Won't you stop? What? Mom. Mom, don't. Mom, mom, don't. Mom, don't. Don't do it, mom. Hon, I'm here. Hon. Where are the kids? I didn't mean to. What is it? What happened? I didn't know what happened. What is it? The.. knife. What? Son, what happened? It's mom. She pointed the knife at us. Maria! Why did you do that? I didn't mean to do that, Ermin. You scared the kids. What's happening to you? I didn't know what happened to me. They won't listen. Last thing I knew, I just found myself holding a knife. We're leaving. -Ermin. We're leaving. Please believe me, I didn't mean to do that. Children, you're going to school now? I'm sorry about last night. It's fine. Just forget about it. Take care, hon. Take care of our kids. What happened to you? I'm tired. You're tired already? Okay, let's just play hide and seek. Okay. But you're it. What? Why me? -You didn't catch me. What? Why me?

Hon, the kids. Tell them to come, so we can eat together. This is amazing, hon. Really special. I said call the kids so they can try this as well. This is delicious. Where are the kids? What? I said where are the kids? Tell them to come, so we can eat together. Where are they? I told you to call the kids. What are you pointing at? I can't understand you. I told you to call the kids. I want them to have dinner with me. I can't understand you. My kids. Pablo? Rosalinda? You're an animal, what have you done with my children? You animal! My children, forgive me. I wasn't here to save you. I don't know why this happened to us. I'm gonna miss you. I love you so much. Please forgive me. Are you sure, babe? You'll be going down here? Yes, babe. Go back. We are very sure. Okay, babe. You guys take care. I love you. I love you, too. Don't fool us, I know that you won't bring us there.. Come on. Tricycle! Tricycle! Here it is, sis. You will finally ride a tricycle. It's you again? You're not gonna drive me all the way to home again? I can't go there. It's scary and forbidden. Is there anything scarier than your face? Come on, get inside. You see how pretty my friend is? Send us home, okay? How rude! I hate that tricycle driver. Why did he leave us here? I don't know. I've been riding tricycle for years. But they are always asking me to go down here. They seem so scared about something. Even if I offer them extra or 3x the fare, they really insist that I should get down here. So you mean you want me to walk all the way there? -Go walk! So you mean you want me to walk all the way there? Wow, your shoes are nice. This won’t fit in you. -You're over dramatic. Come on. This won’t fit in you. -Come on. Ouch! Oh, sis. You're funny. Can you see that? Which one? Where? I know you're just trying to scare me. Stop that. She's bending over. So what if she's bending over? She might just have a stomach ache. Monster, monster. -Ouch. Monster, monster. Monster, monster. Let's go. Monster, monster. -She might eat us. Monster, monster. Monster, monster. Why are you running? Monsters are not real, sis! How can you be sure of that? What? Wait. What are you looking for? The onion, tomato, garlic, ginger, pepper, salt. Why? You want to cook? You still have the appetite, after what we've just saw? It’s for protection from the monsters! It's not even effective. What are you saying? Wait for me. I'll see if there's still an open store. Take this. -Don't leave me here, sis. Take this. Change your clothes first. I'll go and find an open store. I'm gonna buy, onion, tomato, garlic, ginger, pepper, salt. -Okay. I'll change first. I'm gonna buy, onion, tomato, garlic, ginger, pepper, salt. I'm gonna buy, onion, tomato, garlic, ginger, pepper, salt. Sis! The store is still open. I have it. Sis, you're scaring me again. What are those? I'm serious about this. Very serious. We're going to put this here. So the monster won't come for us. This ginger, this garlic, we should place a lot of garlic. That's better. It will be more effective if it’s scattered like that. All of it. Okay. There. Let's sleep. We can sleep peacefully now. Come on. We're already protected. Okay, just wait. Help! Help! Oh! Come inside. Sir! A dead body was found earlier. Look for the suspect. This is what I've heard in the news. About someone who's eating flesh. You're right. Sir, let me join them. Are you sure? Yes, sir. Where? She's in the treehouse. This way, men. Don't shoot her. That's my wife. You want us to kill each other? Go on, is that what you want? You want to settle this in a fight? Ermin, Sergeant. -What? Come on. Ermin, Sergeant. What's the matter here? Please try to understand, but as a captain of this neighborhood. It's my responsibility to keep its peace and order. Besides, you're both policemen. Why won't you just talk about this? Sir, Ermin is being unreasonable lately. We've almost caught that monster. He just intervenes. That's right. We should kill that monster. We never know, she might kill more. A lot of people will die if we don't kill that monster. Think about it, your name is at stake. If I were you, chief, I'll get him off this case. He should not take part on this. We all know it's his wife. Sir. Sir. Sir. You want to talk to me, sir? I'm sorry to say, but you won't be handling this case anymore. Why, sir? I'll file a charge against you if you will continue to insist. But, sir. That's an order. I'm Sergeant Dela Cruz. I know that you're the right person to consult regarding this matter. I'm expecting you. I know that you have an extraordinary problem. Come on. I came here to see you. My wife ate my children. And she's not herself. We need to know where it came from. So we can understand how she became a monster. She's been like that since she came back from Saudi. Based from what I know, it could be one of the two causes. First, she asked to be possessed by its power. Second, the power may have been transferred to her. What do you mean? There's no hope for my wife? As far as I know, no one can recover from that curse. What you can do is avoid doing things that will make her angry or thirst for flesh. Because when that happens, she won't be able to recognize you. You mean, there's nothing you could do to make her normal again? Nothing at all. Chief! Yes? This is absurd, she killed one of our men. This isn't easy, chief. We're fighting against a monster. Damn. I don't believe in monsters. Kill her. Wait. Who thought about this? We've been walking for a while and yet we haven't found that Maria Labo. I'm too tired. Let's just do one last round. We will find her. If we still can’t find her, then we'll go home. Let's go. I'm really tired. We haven't seen anything. Let's go home. Come on. Let's go. Let's go home. Yes. Wait. Look. Isn't that Maria Labo? Where? There. Where? Look there, isn't that Maria Labo? You're right. She's dead. Come on. She's already dead. She's dead. I told you so. Let's go. We finally killed her. Maria Labo is dead right? No more monsters. There's no monster anymore. What do you think? What if Ermin is also a monster? I think. Right? They're a couple. Yes. They are family of monsters. Let's go home, you're drunk. Wait. Let's have another round. Where are you going? Where are you? Okay. I'll go here. Go. You see, you're already drunk. I'm not yet drunk. You're throwing up already. I can still drink. Let's have another drink. Where are you? Bro? Let's look at the corner. Scatter around. Thanks, Enrico. You're welcome. Where's Maria Labo? We saw her around that area. Let's go. Cap, we'll be going here. There! She's gone. Where did she go? Check it. Make sure she's dead. Cap, she's dead. Let's go, bring her. Cap, finally. We killed her. We will temporarily delay the discussion about the nearing election to broadcast this very important news about a horrifying incident in the province of Pilar. Regarding an alleged disastrous monster also known as Maria Labo. The residents of Pilar is overwhelmed regarding the alleged death of Maria Labo. She's being suspected as a shape shifting monster, roaming the province of Pilar, due to the missing insides of its victims. Watch me, watch me. This is easy. You just need a few touches. I know what to put on you.
