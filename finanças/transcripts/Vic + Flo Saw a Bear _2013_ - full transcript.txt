Are you playing for money? Yeah. What about you? Sometimes he plays, sometimes I play. The thing is, you're not all that good. You need to practise some more. I don't know, maybe. I think you do. You can't ask people for money if you don't know how to play. You could still give us money just to encourage us. VIC + FLO SAW A BEAR What are you doing here? Hello. My name is Victoria. I saw you earlier, playing with your helicopter. ?mile Champagne is my uncle. Oh yeah? Yeah. Who are you? Charlot. I take care of him. Why is he in a wheelchair? He's half paralyzed. And he can't speak anymore. Since when? For as long as I've known him. Do you come here a lot? Every day. I feed him, I clean. Sometimes another guy comes and helps him. His name is Champagne too. My brother, I know... OK. Well... Listen, Charlot... I think I'm going to move in here for a while. Is that all right with you? If you're family, it's all right. I'll just have to tell my father. What does your father have to do with it? I told you, I'm family. ?mile! It's me, Victoria. Your niece! Ms. Champagne! He can't speak, but he's not deaf. So he can understand me, but he'll never answer me? That's right. What's that little blue box? His insulin pump. What's that? It's a pump that controls his glycemia. What's that? His blood sugar level. He gets insulin every four hours. You have to watch what he eats and clean his pump once or twice a week. You do all that? Yeah, but I'm used to it. Jesus! You've become quite a handful, eh, ?mile? You want me to show you what I do when I come here? You'll have to come back another time for that, Charlot. I'm tired. I think I know enough for today. Would you mind leaving? Mr. ?mile always sleeps in his chair. You just press the little button on the side to lay him down. I'll figure it out, big guy. Come scratch at the screen door tomorrow. You'll read me the instruction manual and we'll continue our chat, OK? Do you remember me, Uncle ?mile? Victoria, Mona's daughter. I'm... I'm going to stay here. We'll have to put up with each other, OK? Just plant a few things and make a garden. It'd be nice. We'll see. Who's she? Cynthia. We go boating together. Boating? Yeah, I have a boat. So, what do we do about Uncle ?mile? Taking care of him must be a lot like taking care of a garden. The kid next door comes and waits on him. It'll be all right. You can count on Charlot. He'll help you. Do you need anything? Just say so. Don't be stubborn. I'll manage. Thanks, Yvon, you're very kind. Take it. She's not a bad woman, Uncle ?mile, but give me a shout if she bites you or poisons your food, OK? I know you're never coming back, Yvon. I'll leave it with you. My dad wanted to throw it out. You just have to remember to charge the battery. Bring me to the bank. I'll try driving on the way back. Stop! What? I saw something in the woods. A fox or something. You've never seen one? Never. Ms. Champagne? Were you waiting for me? You could say that. Just so you know, I can't tell you when I'll be dropping in. It's peaceful here. It's nice. You want to do this outside or inside? Inside would be better. Is this gentleman Yvon Champagne? No. That's ?mile Champagne, my uncle. But Yvon Champagne does live here? Yes, yes. He's out for the day though. You've been here for four days? That's right. How's it going? Fine. Can you elaborate on that? Well, I haven't rebuilt my life in four days. I'm doing fine. We'll see a lot of each other at first, but... we'll get there, OK? I'll come by twice a week. Next time, I'll have to see your brother, Yvon, OK? What is this place? A sugar shack? Yes, but it's not in operation. The equipment is still here. I'm not going to start it up again. You could. Is your uncle infirm? Yes, Yvon wants to place him elsewhere, but for now, looking after him keeps me busy. Do you think you can handle it? I'm 61 years old. It's not about age, Ms. Champagne. I'm going to look around, OK? Do what you have to. - Is this your room? - Yes. You aren't worried you'll get bored out here? Can I go upstairs? Go ahead. Do you use this room? Yvon gave me his room downstairs. He sleeps upstairs. Each visit, before I leave, I'm going to make some notes. Do I have the right to object? Unfortunately, no. Not to be overbearing. I just want things to be clear between us. There must have been some good parties here. How old are you? There are a lot of questions that you won't be allowed to ask me. Sorry. Hey, nice old jukebox! Vintage. Would you be interested in seeing a psychologist? It's depressing having the old man right out there. I cried so much while I was waiting for you. But I'm here now. We'll find something for my uncle ?mile. Like what? Let me think about it. Are you hungry? There's some roast beef left. No, I'm all right. You really want to live here? Arert you happy? It's so calm. And did you see? We have a garden! Wow! A garden! Cool! Oh my! Where's your garden gnome? You're such a smartass! Stop! That's enough! Holy shit! Hold on... Don't do that again! Come on... Yeah, yeah. Sure... Go! Stop, stop! I don't have the strength. Come on! All right, I got it. Oh no! - Wait! - Come on! - Wait a second! - Push! What do you think I'm doing? Hang on, I'm going to... OK! I... Did you see? No, wait a minute. Whoa! Hang on. Just wait, I have to get in. Are you driving now? It's like death out here, Vic. There's a town nearby. It's heated. We have lights. We can go out in the woods. There's no stress. I love you. I did this for us. There's a bar, a store, a restaurant. Oh, well, if there's a restaurant... For Christ's sake, Flo. The parole officer was here. He'll by coming by from time to time. More good news! Florence Richemont? Sir. Guillaume Perreira-Leduc. Can I talk to you? The forest is a public place. Technically, we don't have to talk to each other. You did your time, you're free. But since you're in Victoria's life, it'd be better if we got to know each other. Ah, mister parole officer. You want me to spy on Vic for you, is that it? You're lucky to be able to live together. Did you know she can't associate with anyone with a criminal record? The fact that we're letting you move in here is a gift. A gift... A privilege, Florence. Victoria lied. She made it seem as though her brother was living there. Looks like your machine isn't infallible. This could be a temporary arrangement, you understand? All right, you've convinced me. You've got the keys to the prison in the pockets of your fine shirt. I get it. Victoria isn't dangerous. I know. But it's best that we get to know each other. Why? We could go into town and buy some lollipops or shoe polish. No, thanks. Where does this path go? To the land of the apes. I'll ask again: Where does this path go? Nowhere. There's a hill... I saw a river or a lake, nothing special. Thanks. Guillaume is cute. You think so? Yeah. He's a dirty little flunky, but he's cute. Did he piss you off? We have to deal with it. Do you think he can make life difficult for us? No, I don't think so, but don't mess around with him. I love bossy little guys like him. I said, don't mess around with him. Are we going to make sugar in your shack? We're going to freeze here in the winter. I'm not going to the city just to please you. I'm old enough to know that I hate people. Are you going to get yourself a man? I didn't say that. I like being with you. A big man who smells like sweat, huh? Who grabs you with his big hands, with a nice big, hairy chest... Hello! Hello. I didn't mean to bother you. This is the main sewer line. I came to take some water samples. Is the water OK? No, don't worry. Could I use your bathroom? - Are you alone? - Yes. Never mind, I'll go to the garage. No, go ahead. Thanks. You're very kind! Your place is very nice! Thanks. What do you do? Do you work for the city? There's been some water mixing, and a bunch of kids at the school got sick, so we're checking it out. I took some water samples and... Have you been sick? Good. Don't worry about it, OK? Ms... Champagne, Victoria Champagne. Marina Saint-Jean. It's a pleasure. If you're living here, it's best we know each other. - Do you need anything? - No, no! Was that funny? Well, you're funny. You're not shy at all. There's no reason to be shy. I've always thought that the sugar shack should reopen. I don't know anything about it. I'll come by for coffee and we'll chat, if that's all right with you. We'll see. You'll think this is funny, but... I'm crazy about gardening too. I'll come by with some nitrogen, phosphorus and potash. - What are those? - Fertilizers. I'll explain it all to you. You'll see, you'll have one hell of a garden. Are you like this with everyone? I do have another favour to ask of you. Would it bother you if I rode my quad on your land from time to time? It's the only shortcut to get to the lake. Not too often, not at night and not too early in the morning. - I promise. - OK, no problem! I'm very happy to have met you, Ms. Champagne. Can I sit down? Do I know you? Nicolas Smith. I'm Charlot's father. You must have heard about him. Why are you sitting so close? Charlot's been caring for ?mile for two years. So? And why are you sitting so close? Victoria is not nice. Not nice at all. It makes the old man sad, and that has an effect on Charlot. What's that got to do with me? You have no heart, goddammit! I know you're letting him die! What's a chick like you doing in that shack with that old hag? Mind your own business, asshole. We're going to get him out of there. He deserves better. That's what I'm saying. Why are you telling me? Are you afraid of Vic? Heartless bitch! Can you bring me back to the bar? I can bring you home. I'd prefer the bar. All right. Damn! Christ! Leave it, you're going to hurt yourself. Come help me! We'll do it tomorrow! I'm tired! - Is this good? - Too close to the woods! The mice are going to swim in it more than we will. Hey, watch my carrots! You're pissing me off! Who's that idiot? Calm down. It's a woman I met the other day. - A woman? - She works for the city. She asked my permission to ride through here, and I said yes. You said yes? Yes, I said yes! I know how to treat people. She was cool, funny. What's your sweet biker chick's name? I don't remember. How old is she? 45, 50. It's not important. I'm very pleased with you. Is he talking to us? No, I'm serious. You have a good attitude, and we're working well together. It's encouraging. We're good, huh? I feel good about the future, that's all. This isn't my job, but I want to try to convince you to do some activities. Get out a bit and see people. What do you do, Guillaume, to see people, to be part of society? This is normal. I'm just saying that your progression is normal. Come on, tell her how to be part of society. My choices have nothing to do with yours. Are you fostering a child in Ethiopia, Guillaume? Are you a member of Greenpeace, Guillaume? Are you in a book club, Guillaume? Do you play badminton on Fridays at noon, Guillaume? Do you give canned food to the poor at Christmas, Guillaume? I have confidence in you both. Take it step by step, we'll get there. I forgot to tell you. A complaint was lodged with social services about Mr. ?mile. What complaint? You know what I mean. Stop beating around the bush. Say what you've gotta say. An ambulance will come and get him tomorrow. He'll be placed in a more appropriate facility. I came by with a social worker and you were out. We spoke to Charlot and his father, and we all agreed that Mr. ?mile can't stay here. It's not that we don't trust you. He just needs better care. Go home, Guillaume. What do you like about me? Why do you always do that? Because I'm scared. Scared of what? I don't know. Scared to be scared. You have nothing to fear. Then tell me what you like about me. You're my Victoria. You give me security. You give all of this meaning. Shit, I don't know! There are men in town, in the woods, everywhere. You're sexy. I've seen you with Guillaume. Stop it. That idiot's gay! I don't need to be interrogated. That's just it! What do you need? You're so melodramatic! Can't we just enjoy life? I found some money. What? In a box behind the washer. - How much? - Enough. It must belong to Uncle ?mile. And? Nothing! I'm keeping the money for this place, for us. Arert you going to put it in the bank? I don't care about it! Yeah, you do. Why else would you tell me about it? I'm going to keep you with me by loving you, by cooking for you, cleaning for you. You don't have to pay for anything. You can do what you want. If you leave, I'll kill myself. I have nothing else. That's unealthy, Vic. I hate it when you're like this. I don't know what the future holds, but you're in it. Stop it! You talk too much. Did you see what I did? That's all there is to it. Once every three weeks is plenty. Water them 30 minutes before you lay down the potash. I'll leave the tubs here. The phosphorus is just once a season. And the nitrogen is every three days. OK? I'm listening, but I don't know anything! The potash will help your tomatoes. The phosphorus is good for the roots, it prevents disease. And the nitrogen is for the lettuce. Gardening runs in my family. I never get tired of it. I'll buy you better tools too. Geez, I'll call you for the plumbing, the painting and the lawn too! Hey, do you think... I could talk to Florence? - You know Florence? - You bet I do. Florence left this morning. I don't know when... Where do you know her from? I work at the bar too. I'm the manager. Ah, I see. So? Florence comes to the bar a lot. Yeah, and? Well, I don't want to bother you with this, but it'd be nice if you could tell her that we'd like her to pay. There was a party and she left a big bill. A party? What are you talking about? That's it, Victoria. There's nothing wrong with having fun, but she has to pay her bill if she wants to come back. - We've gotta stay afloat. - How much does she owe? Can you tell her to come by tonight? Stay right there. I'll pay you. Calm down. She owes me $215. Don't move. I'd like to see Marina. Who? Marina, the manager. I don't know any Marina. Who's the manager then? I'm the owner and the manager. Is there a problem? Who's Marina? Is she a customer? No idea! Saint-Jean! Marina Saint-Jean! I have no idea! I don't know this Marina! Stop looking at me like that! Giving $200 to a friendly passerby! How na?ve are you? $215! You're even more na?ve then! Can I drink $215 won'th? How would I know? You make me so angry! You let some slut tell you stories! You pay her, no questions asked! Don't yell at me. I'm hiding in the forest because there are thugs looking for me. You know that, right? Whoa, that was ten years ago! Did you come here to hide or did you come for me, Flo? Marina Saint-Jean. No one by that name in Kirkdale? Francoeurville, Saint-Claude, Shipton, nothing? Thank you. Rest up, you're going to have a big day. Jesus! Jackie... Jackie. How did you find me? I'm very smart. Everyone knows that. Jesus, how did you find me? Who is he? You haven't changed! What do you want? To hurt you badly. Stop fooling around! What do you want? Tell me what you want, Jackie. We'll work it out. You're being a cowboy. You want to act tough. You want to terrorize me! Talk to me, goddammit! I know I screwed up! What did you want me to do? It's all right, isn't it? I paid for everyone! You know what's on your conscience. You bitch! Leave my girlfriend Victoria alone, OK? Come on... Are we negotiating or am I watching you tan? What are you doing? Oh, what are you doing? No, get away! You OK? You don't want to talk to the police? Why not? I don't know, it's all right. She got her revenge. She could come back. Talk to Guillaume at least. It's fine! She broke my leg. She settled it. Are you sure? One day at a time, Vic. One day at a time. Let me heal. Just stay with me. Is pushing girls in wheelchairs part of your job description? It's my pleasure, Florence. Let yourself be pampered a bit. Gentleman, my ass. Whoa! Where are you taking me? You OK? Yeah. Do you need a degree for your job? Criminology. Do you look after a lot of ex-convicts? That's confidential. Do you have a boyfriend? That's also confidential. But yes, I do. And that's all I'll tell you. Why did you climb that tree? I don't know, I... I got into a fight with Vic. I made a mistake, that's all. What was the fight about? It's confidential. It could've been a lot worse, you know. I know, Dad. You going to spy on Vic for the rest of her life? Victoria received a life sentence. I wish you'd understand why I'm here so we can stop arguing. What are you going to do with her? What do you mean? Does she really make you happy? I think you're young and you want to live a little. Can I ask you something? Yes. You see the container there? Let's do something I used to do when I was a kid. Go up to the container. - What are you talking about? - Trust me. I'm not going to rub up against the garbage. Don't be such a stick in the mud! No one's asking you to rub it! Go on! It's a game! Is it empty? You'll see, Guillaume. This is awesome. I want you to get in the container. - Are you joking? - Come on! It's a kid's game! I'm surprised you don't know it! Come on, do it for me! That's enough. Go on! Guillaume, it'll take two minutes! I won't let you rot there all day! Why did you want me to get in there? You were pissing me off. What would I have done in there? You would've seen that it stinks when you mess with people's shit. Well, you failed. You failed. Jerk. You're writing a lot. Yes, I'm writing a lot. Do you have to write that report here? Don't worry, my notes will be a lot more detailed than this. Tell Guillaume that you're sorry for what you did. What is this crap? Did he get in the container or not? Dammit, Florence! Tell Guillaume that you're sorry. I'm sorry, Guillaume. I'm tired. It's raining and it's sunny at the same time. If you had the choice, would you be the water or the wind? If you had the choice, would you be the water... or the wind? Here. Jesus! What is it? I have something for you. What? Open the door. I won't bite. Who is it? It's all right! ?MILE CHAMPAGNE DIED ON AUGUST 20, 2012... He's dead. It's been ten days? We already had the funeral. You give me this ten days later at my door with that smug look on your face? - You don't care anyway! - Get the hell out of here. I came to get my can't. Give me the keys. They're in it. Go! Just so you know, right up to the end, your uncle shat himself, cried, coughed and bled at the hospital. We took care of him. We wiped his ass, we comforted him, we watched him die, and then we buried him. We'll send you the bill. I hate this! Stop. You couldn't care for him. Forget about it. He can go fuck himself. You know you've been nicer since I've had my cast? Why do you say that? I don't know, I've noticed it. Cuddling, little shows of affection... What's the deal with your cast? Nothing. It comes off in 10 days. What then? How should I know? We'll do the usual. And what's the usual? Being together. I think you don't mind that I'm injured. I'm here, I'm yours, I can't do anything. You're really... "Made in 1977, "this is a model M420W locomotive. "It was used on the Canadian National Railway until 1998. "It was then sold to St. Lawrence and Atlantic, "who used it until 2001. "It was given to the museum in 2003. "Made by MLW in December 1955, "this is a model RS-10 locomotive. "It was used until 1998. "It came to the museum thereafter. "The locomotive with burn marks is a model S-4 made in July 1951 "by Montreal Locomotive Works. "It bore the number 102 throughout its career in the Saguenay. "It was involved in an incident and the cabin went up in flames." Thank you. That was a lot of fun, huh? Hey, hey! Don't cream your shorts because you took us to see some fish! You didn't like it? I loved it. I've never been so excited. Screw you guys. You think we can ask for a fork at some point? We'll find you a fork, Victoria. I'm going to smoke. I don't like when she gets like that. Is she different? She's stuck inside her own head. She's scared. You think so? Of what? Of losing me. If you want to leave, then leave. I'll talk to her. We'll see. What will you say? I'll figure it out. I'll take her to the lake. It'll be peaceful. I don't want her to get worked up. You want me to be there? No. Thanks, Guillaume. She reminds me of my mother. It's weird. Pardon me? She's a bit like my mom, that's all. You're cute. You're getting me all emotional. Come on! I'm going to the bathroom. Were you talking behind my back? Absolutely. Of course not. He said that you remind him of his mother. We should come here more. It's nice. Yeah, it's nice. I have something to say. Well then! I figured we werert here to plant a pine tree. Let's talk without arguing, all right? We're cut off. I like men too. I want a life, a job, I don't know. We're living like shut-ins. Shut-ins? You're not blind. You know what I mean. Where are you going to take your uneducated ass? Why a man? You can insult me if you want. It's my life. I'm scared. They smashed my leg, remember? It's clear for me: We're going to end up together. I'd do anything to keep you. Who said anything about losing me? I'm here. I've had it with that shack. I've visited some apartments. You need to pull back a bit. We have to change, Vic. It'll be good for you, and for me. You need to buy new shoes. Those ones are nasty. Fuck! What? Nothing. I said, "Fuck," that's all. Have you done other things behind my back? I would never hurt you. I'm like a gangster with this cane. Tell me something you've never told me before. Come on, tell me something. I don't know. Tell me. We're all alone in the woods. Did you or did you not sleep with fat Agn?s? You're awful, cut it out. Jesus, it's been five years. Just tell me. Anything but that, Vic! You put your little tongue in her big mouth. Admit it! You're so annoying! You put your delicate fingers in Agn?s Joncas, didn't you? No! What's this? Hello? Hello! Listen. Flo! Help! Can you move? It's broken. It's broken. Jackie... let me out. Let me out. Vic is on the other side. Jackie... Did you do this? You couldn't have done this! I know. Horrible people like me don't really exist. I'm sorry, my dear. You have nothing to do with this. But I'm a fucking brute. The garden looks good, huh? Fertilizer's important. It happens fairly often, hikers stumbling accidentally into bear traps. It was an accident. An accident. Bye, gorgeous. I'm sorry. What? I'm sorry! I told you we'd end up together. I love you. And if I had a choice, I'd be the wind. I can't hear anything. Calm down. Are you still bleeding? What are you playing now? I've gotten better. What's your name, young man? Lucien. You're better than you were before... little Lucien. But... I don't have any money on me. I knew those two sluts would be nothing but trouble. Shut your goddamn mouth. Just shut up. It's over. Translation by Joshua Beitel
