'Mystic river' Yesterday I narrated Jhansi Rani's story for my baby Today I'll tell you the story of Casabianca Dad, who is Casabianca? Casabianca was the son of a ship's captain in France He was a very smart boy One day, just like you, he was adamant to go out with his father He went out with his father on the ship When they were sailing happily viewing the nature's beauty... Suddenly the enemy countries fleets rounded up their ship... and started attacking them with guns and tanks Oh no! Then, what happened? Struck by bullets, their ship caught fire Immediately his father took him to a safe spot on the deck and... he told him not to move from that place until he orders him Then his father left to save others Oh no! Eventually everyone started to escape in the small boats attached to the ship When those men escaped, they asked Casabianca to join them What did Casabianca do? He refused to move from that place until his dad tells him to do so Poor boy didn't knew that his father was shot and lying dead in the basement of the ship Slow and steady the fire was catching up Finally a huge bomb struck the ship and it drowned, taking down Casabianca along with it Dear... Dear, are you asleep? Come on, dad! If I was in his place, I'd have shot everyone and save my father! My dear brave heart! Fine... you got school tomorrow, isn't it?

What's the problem? Tell me What's the matter? What's the secret between you both? Do you think auto-rickshaw driver is a cheap profession? Who says so? No way You're saying it for the sake of it Will you agree to marry an auto-rickshaw driver? Why not? If I like him then I'll marry him for sure Want to know a secret? When my parents met an astrologer and checked my horoscope... the astrologer said 'Your daughter will marry someone you don't approve of' 'And chances are that she will marry a guy in driving profession' Ever since, wherever I go... they keep spying on whom do I talk to and what I'm up to Guess what, it coincides with the prediction for my horoscope Our astrologer says I'll be successful in driving profession Mark my words... you will be highly successful for the good heart you have Hey Roshni...

Sorry! I don't have such intentions Don't make a hasty call, Kowsh I am ready to do anything for you. Just say it I'm leaving Kowsh, relax! Relax! Cool Fine... You don't have to love me back But please don't hurt me on my birthday Just wait for ten minutes Leave after I cut the cake. Please No, Vinoth I don't have a good feeling about it. I'm leaving Can't you understand? You won't get a better guy than me! You'll regret later Hey! You better stay in your limits! I have no intention of falling in love Stop being so adamant First, give way! You think you can force me to love you? Stop showing off! If you leave now, I won't spare you! What will you do? I'll morph dirty pictures with your face and leak it on net Trying doing that and I'll do the same to you When Drona requested, all Arjun could focus was only the parrot's eye Similarly to achieve our goals, we must focus only on those goals Sir... Give your order - One chilly parotta for me - Ok Not parotta. It's not good for health, dear Come on, dad. Once in a while, its fine One chilly parotta for me and Ragi dosa for my dad Congrats sir. I heard you got promoted as the HM Had your food? Let's talk in school tomorrow Dad... A guy says that he is in love with me Fine, what was your reply? I gave him an earful Never scold anyone out of haste It's a dangerous world out there Some issues must be dealt carefully Without scolding or hurting him and in a soft manner... you must explain him that this is the age to study and nothing else There is a lot of distance and heights for this froglet to reach If you find it difficult to talk to that guy... shall I talk to him? It's ok, dad. I got this Vishwanathan, Sri Nidhi, Harish, Subbulakshmi, Ranganathan, Rajakumari That's too many people in your family, bro If I do the same, then I must sell my rickshaw and buy a truck. It's a long list You are the only person who can joke in a serious tone Forget me Look at him "Scent of my lover, runs all over me" Look like a new proverb on your rickshaw So, next you're falling for Malliga? Oh! Come on! She likes Senthil How do you say that? She gave hints the other day when she came in his rickshaw She said she'll marry a rickshaw driver if she likes him Stop encouraging him You have no idea about him. I know since the first grade Do you know when he fell in love the first time? You won't believe it. Back then we were in the second grade Meena teacher was our class teacher She was very beautiful. She never scolds the students She used to care a lot for us Our teacher hasn't turned up for the past four days. The class is boring Indeed. School is boring without her I'm thinking of marrying her What do you mean? Then I can be with her all the time Then you must propose her! That's all? I'll do it No way. I'll also propose her Only I'll propose to her! Only me! Stop! Let's not fight over it Let's put a toss and decide Spit side or plain? - Spit side I win! - Plain side I win! It's plain side! Plain side! I won! I won! Yay! That's when we found out that Meena teacher got married And it was for her marriage she took four days off That was his first love failure Bro! In second grade? That too your teacher? Man! You rock! The list doesn't end there Mythili in fourth grade Geetha teacher in sixth grade Monica in seventh grade Janaki in the ninth grade Because Janaki quit the school, he also quit school Like he continued and completed his degree Five girls during school Three after coming here And now it's Malliga Come on, everyone does this Well, you guys don't have the guts to say it but I do Hey, wait and watch! If Malliga doesn't fall in love with me... then make fun of me. Got it? Write a civil services exam after completing degree... IAS job is not an easy one to get - Check this out SK sir - What? Ramalingam seems to be quite happy - Don't you want to know? - Let's ask him What's up Ramalingam? You look very excited and happy Well, my daughter is engaged Isn't she very young? My daughter is doing her BA, second year Ramalingam... what's the hurry to get your daughter married? Sir, I'll retire next year I must get some loan and marry off my daughter by then Ramalingam... Don't you love your daughter? Sir, she is my life Rich or poor... Yet we would have given the best for our daughters and raised them What would a girl know at the age of 20? She would be all confused on the day her marriage And we'll be worried about how her husband and in-laws will judge her Instead we parents must feel proud when we stand on the marriage dais with our daughter But how? Educate your daughter and once she is on her own, we will feel proud! Come on! What if she elopes with someone else? Then what do we do? Ramalingam! Is that all the trust you have on your daughter? You think girls elope with someone just like that? Trust them and they won't break it Sir, now what pissed him off? He is someone who refuses the HM post so that he can help his daughter focus on studies Forget it Do you think he'll woo Malliga? By the looks of it, I guess yes Who's Mani? It's me What business do you have in our area rickshaw stand? If I see you anywhere around it again... you'll be dead! Don't hit him He may die! It's ok, leave them - Bro, let them go - Senthil, leave it - Forget it - Leave me! Leave me! This would have been over with one slap on me Why would you hit them like that in a haste? They won't rest until they finish us off He fought for you and is this how you talk? Get lost! Bread and butter is what matters the most than war! Just till your leg is fine Say maximum ten days I'll be back then We'll take care of it - Excuse me - Yes? Excuse me! Who are you? You seem new Just a minute Where is Vaanakar? He injured his leg. Hence, I'm here on his behalf And you are? Do you know chef Muthuswami at Sengamettu street? Yes, I do I'm his son - So you're one of us - Indeed Hey, I'll talk to you later Did you take your lunch box? Yes, uncle - Sure? - I did! - Drive carefully - Ok - Good morning, miss - Good morning Why are you embarrassing me? Her father is after all an elementary school teacher I'm an M.Phil graduate I revealed the question paper to you yet you messed it up! So, Ms. Malini, what rank did Vaishu get? She got only the second rank She fell sick exactly during exams Or else I'm sure she would have done well So, who came first? Kowsalya right? Don't keep reading Close the book She will still reading Hey, don't tease me Why didn't you come in the rickshaw with me? I didn't want to Why? I won't come with you hereafter What do you mean? Why would you propose Vinoth? Hey! He is lying! - No way - He was the one who proposed me And when I refused guess what he said You are the one lying to me This is why one must never trust silent girls Excuse me... I have something important to ask you Hello I'm on my way Can you drive a bit fast Yes, sure Keep going straight Where to? Not to the shop? Excuse me... Let me know if there is any issue. I'll take care of it Nothing of that sorts Stop at the railway station Ok Thanks a lot You have helped me a lot Around three times I didn't pay you any fare Here, have this See you Why did you change the love proverb?

You'll be shocked to know with whom The guy who got beaten up the other day, Kumar She eloped with him Bro, Malliga did give hints the other day Guess we didn't get it Stop it! You said the same thing on that day Dude, stop reacting as it is happening the first time to you Drink the tea before it goes cold Forget her! She isn't even so worthy! - Bro, let's drink tonight - Sure! This is the best medicine at this hour You can't escape. You got the first rank, so better buy us all cool drinks I'll buy for sure but we got only ten minutes Hey, get lost! Vaishnavi! Muthulakshmi! - Come on, Kowsalya's treating - Come, let's go Muthu, come on I'm not coming. You guys carry on What are you studying? Study well! But anyway you'll score not more than 50 marks Muthu, come join us Don't mistake me, Kowsi If I join today for your treat then someday I should also treat you all Don't you know my family's plight Even if for once my dad doesn't waste money on drinks and gives it for household expenses... and that would be a treat for my family Fine I won't mistake if you don't join us But don't mind others making fun of you Studying is like saving money You will definitely score good marks one day Stop showing off and join us I said, come Hey, hold on You look beautiful.

They fell from the bike near the clock tower Crowd gathered and that guy escaped Poor girl, she was lying helpless I reached at the right time and I didn't know what to do - Hence I got her here - Roshni Vinoth!

Please forgive me Because of him I judged you Thanks a lot Come on, don't mention it Then what did Roshni's parents say? Her parents are quite furious with her No idea when they'll send her back to school Obviously. How will they send her to school if she behaves like this Basically she is a nice girl It was that guy. He is a spoilt brat He cheated her Thank God you reached there on time Or else... Thank God you are not a part of their group Kowsalya!

Which is Vaanakar's house? - That's the one - Ok I guess this is his house Excuse me Please come in How's your health now, uncle? Is your leg better now? Why did you trouble yourself? I would have returned in ten days Why did you disturb her, Senthil? Well, she was adamant And so I thought I'll also pay you a visit Dear... Get some water to drink Has the pain subsided? Yes, that's my daughter Our cracker warehouse exploded My wife and my son-in-law passed away And my daughter... ...burnt her face Grandpa, why are you crying? Nothing dear All my struggles are for these two Working hard for our loved ones who trust and dependent on us What else happiness can we find other than that? Listen, your father is a chef but apart from it... like the wood used for cooking, he too burns himself throughout the day to raise you both Why are you doing these chores? Let me do it, dear Give it to me - Give it to me - Here, dad I had been to the astrologer Marimuthu's house today He says our time will be good once January is here I pray to our deity that you should reconcile with your husband. That is all I wish for Like that's going to happen. I wonder what I'm going to do about this irresponsible son of mine I have placed this month's due amount in the shelf. Please use it Yay! Mom, look at this. Uncle bought me a toy What's up, Senthil? I see you waiting at the juice shop in the morning and evening - Cool, carry on - Oh! Come on bro - Shall we start? - Bro... I missed the mini bus. Can you drop me off at the Dharmapuram stop? - I'll take a bus from there - Ok, get in Bro, that girl running the juice shop is a good friend of mine She already has a boyfriend. So don't waste time waiting in the queue Waiting in the queue? And that too me? Instead of falling in love with some girl... I better get married to a donkey Please don't take a hasty decision and get married to a donkey Why do you say so? Marrying relatives is a taboo So you mean I am a donkey? This is what I get in turn for helping you Run before I bash you up Don't mistake me, bro What made you feel that marrying a donkey is better? At least it won't ditch us Not all girls are the same Quick, the bus is about to leave Bye, bro The reason I wait at the juice shop... is because of what you all think Didn't you say that your father is worried that Vinoth might harm you again? Hence, I arrive a bit early to pick you up Excuse me I have arranged another rickshaw - What? - You go home in that rickshaw Vinoth, pack your things and be ready We must leave at sunset Madam, please take care of your son Now drive, Velu An attempt to murder case at Pattamangalam I got to solve it and get relieving order by afternoon Let's start - Listen, get into the jeep - Uncle, what happened? - Give me the bike - But why? I'll tell you why Don't panic, we got to go to the government hospital What happened? You mother is admitted in the ICU What? A criminal stabbed her while trying to hunt him down Mom! Looks like your mother forget to carry the gun Soni... - Finally you got a girlfriend. Get married soon - Of course! - No way I'm letting go of her - Listen guys... Are girls and love the only topics you discuss all the time? There is much more to life than that First you force a girl to love you Then you force her to marry you soon This is unfair You don't booze but you talk philosophies as if you're drunk You guys will realize it someday You better leave! You never told us. You quietly got into a relationship Listen, one who always keeps saying never achieves One who achieves does it quietly He did it! Unlike you I was waiting for you a long time, yesterday I forgot it was Sunday Oh, come on now. Why would you want to go to school even on a Sunday? You need at least a day's rest in a week Halting studies and resting won't achieve me the expected results Why do you have the proverb 'Never trust girls' written on your rickshaw? It's just for fun I don't like it Is this the temple you regularly pray at? In happiness, sorrow, victory or failure, my dad and myself, we come here Sounds awesome! This is our family's deity too Dear. Did I scare you? - Why would you scare her in the morning? - Are you lovers? God will bless you both I noticed that you removed the proverb sticker "Enough a little glance, my dear" "To see you, my girl" Buddy... - I have something to ask you - What is it? Is it ok to fall in love with a girl who is rich and well educated than us? Tell me who is the girl The girl whom I pick and drop to school, Kowsalya It won't set you. Why are you acting strange? Are you sick? You! Watch out! Reckless drivers! Stop jumping in my way I'm perfectly alright Why are you so quiet today? I won't be coming from tomorrow Vaanakar will be back Look, no one must go to school! I declare today as holiday for you all So go back to you houses! I said, go! Stop! It's a holiday today. Leave! How dare you raise hands on me? Wait and watch now! No one's listening...Hey, I won't spare your life! Kowsalya... Sorry, uncle. I didn't notice. Hope you are fine now Yes, I'm fine now Senthil's got held up with another trip. Hence, I came Why do you look dull? Are you sick? No. Worried about my studies and exams Don't you worry. I'm sure you'll score good marks and go on to become a doctor I will boast that I used to drop this doctor to her school and back Uncle, can you halt by our deity's temple? Senthil! Where are you off to? Stop right there Kowsalya Senthil! So you won't meet me hereafter? No, Kowsalya I will come to meet you "You are my weakness and you are my strength" "The whole world now complies with my wish, even the moon is shining along with the sun" "Our eyes speak poems in the language of love and it doesn't let us close our eyes" "I am always desperate and waiting to meet and spend time with you" "It always worries me when you have to leave. Wish we could spend time forever" "In breeze of love, here we are like two kites having the time of our life" "Your love doesn't let me sleep. You are all I think about all the time" "You way of talking mesmerizes me and the way you care for me makes me want you more" "Our eyes speak poems in the language of love and it doesn't let us close our eyes" "I am always desperate and waiting to meet and spend time with you" "When I smell your fragrance, I float away high like a feather in the breeze" "All I wish for is you to be me with forever and that is all my life is all about" "A you rise like the sun, I chirp like the birds" "When I lay eyes on you, I dance in joy" "Our eyes speak poems in the language of love and it doesn't let us close our eyes" "I am always desperate and waiting to meet and spend time with you" "I know love is a mess yet I have fallen in love" "I am yearning for you love, don't you make me more desperate" "I am your genie, just rub the lamp, I'll come out and make your wishes come true" "But when I see you even this huge genie turns into and blushes like kid" "You are my weakness and you are my strength" "I am always desperate and waiting to meet and spend time with you" Where is Kowsi? At her friend's home Dear brother... Tell me Remember Senthil who replaced Vaanakar when he got injured I see him and Kowsi hanging out quite often Well... this is a tricky age for her She can't differentiate between good and bad If something goes awry in the future... Don't think too much He dropped to school for a period. Also have helped her a lot They could be friends, right? Dear brother... I think you are pampering Kowsi a bit too much She is not pampered. It's the trust I have on my daughter Show me some nice time piece Check this out Were you waiting to show? Check this one too Something else? - How much for this one? - Rs. 400/- - That one? - Rs. 350/- 350. This one? That's cheap. Just Rs. 180/- - This will run fine, right? Pack it - Of course How about we gift Soni this one? Gifting a time piece is old fashioned We must buy something new and trendy This all that falls in our budget Let him hang this in his rickshaw Fine, whatever - Please pack this one - Sure. Give me that Please wait for five minutes - What's with the secret shopping? - Nothing I saw you Well, I just thought of getting a small gift for Kowsalya Are you still behind her? Won't you ever change? Listen, she is also in love with me This is not like earlier one sided relationships. I am going to marry her So you guys have decided to marry? The marriage cannot be even registered until she turns 18 We are getting married only after she completes her studies You are a rickshaw driver She will get educated and become a doctor or engineer in future Do you think her family will allow? In that we'll elope Today you are her hero, a rickshaw driver When she goes to college, a guy in fancy bike will attract her. What if she falls for him? How dare you? Sorry dude She is trustworthy Really sorry Sorry dude. Please, forgive me. I'm sorry Your love won't end up in marriage You will regret later! Wait and watch! - Hands off me! - Buddy! Making up for slapping me? Forgive me Don't you know me? Why aren't you drinking? Well, I'm planning to quit drinking... Ok, fine You both belong to same caste and you think that makes it easier? They will compare qualification, wealth, status and what not Listen, first look at one's quality! Am I bad person? I'm just a little hot head Listen... be honest and answer me Have I ever played with any girl's life? Even my best friend doesn't know me well - Hello - I want to discuss something important There is a lot to study. I got only two minutes. Make it fast Not over phone, Kowsalya That's ok. Just say it Aiyo! Dad! Who is it, dear? Nothing dad. Just talking to a friend Dad... Well...dad... my friend, she is in love with an auto-rickshaw driver, who isn't much educated Do her parents know about it? No parents would like an uneducated son-in-law At this age, it's all infatuation and not love Think about it after five years and... all this will be nothing but a joke Look over there What a beautiful kite Look how high it is flying The thread attached isn't stopping the kite from flying... instead it helps the kite to fly high in a nice and steady manner If that threads snaps then the kite will lose it way and come down crashing Parents are like that thread Without the thread's guidance the kite is nothing But what if he is an honest and nice guy? Majority of people in this world are basically honest and nice but the question is if they are the right ones to enter our lives This is not the right age to find out that Make your friend understand this Have the milk and continue studying What is basal metabolic rate? Prema, answer the question Do you know the answer or not? I don't know, miss What else do you know? You don't study at all Who cares whether you attend school or not? Had you got married, you'd be mother of two by now Please convey that to my dad, miss It was my mistake asking you at first Silence! Who can answer it? Kowsalya, give me the answer Sorry miss I just explained it. So, you weren't paying attention? Yet you score marks without studying Who else can answer this? Miss... HM has summoned you All of you study the answer before I'm back Want to know a secret? When she asked 'What else do you know?' I can stitch a dress. In fact I stitched my own dress, I mean this one Shocking, she asked a question that even you found it tough to answer You are a rickshaw driver She will get educated and become a doctor or engineer in future Do you think her family will allow? Your love won't end up in marriage - Come on, Kowsalya - My lucky pen! My dad bought me that Wait, I'll get it Fine, forget it Kowsalya... I need to discuss something important with you I have something even more important to discuss In two days... school term gets over Then for a week... I have got study leave Followed by exams So? Both of us...I mean... Until my exams are over... let's not meet... or talk Senthil! Now that you've said it, why are you calling me back? Go, study well become a doctor and get married some doctor guy My friend already warned me I didn't pay heed First, have patience and hear me out I am unable to concentrate on studies I am not attentive during classes All I think about is meeting and spending time with you And if I say this I am worried that you will mistake me Don't you wish that I should become a doctor? How could you even say such a thing? I'll be very proud if you become a doctor But once you become a doctor... will you forget me? Do you think I'll forget my father if I become a doctor? The same goes to you Then... will your dad agree? He will agree to anything I ask for I shall leave now Kowsalya... It's beautiful but... I'll accept it once I get my doctor seat Uncle... Why are you calling him? Focus on studies or else I'll punish you Dad... why didn't you punish me and send me back to school when I refused to study? If you had done it, I would have got educated and been in a good job by now You were his life... you threatened to jump into the well and suicide if sent to school, what else can he do? Senthil asked me to pass this pen to you Hello Senthil... why did you take such a risk? Was it necessary to risk your life and get this pen? Didn't you say it's your lucky pen? Moreover, anything for you is never a risk for me It's not a big deal Excuse me - Yes? - What are you doing here? Just like that. How about a tea for you? - No thanks. How are you? - I'm fine - How's your rickshaw business? - All good Excuse me... Hope Kowsalya is studying well She will study well and become a doctor And later we will marry her off to a doctor You focus on your business and try moving up from rickshaw to car Because you must be the chauffeur for the married couples, at her wedding Sir, tea Did you hear that? Who was that? My uncle? Now do you see what worries me? I can't even sleep thinking about it. It's quite upsetting So just listen and do as I say I'll commit suicide if you don't show up tomorrow What's running in your mind? Answer me! I didn't eat at all yesterday. Do you know that? I was waiting for you... I was waiting expecting you'll come to meet me Neither my family understands me nor do you What do I do? Answer me! Vaishu... A moment please What are you saying?

Why are you quiet? So, you say you won't marry me? So, you say you won't marry me? Oh God! Why did you do this, my dear!? Move! Move! - Drive fast! Lord, save my daughter! - Quick, drive carefully Her forearms are full of blade marks Is that why she always wears full sleeves? Why would she do something stupid like this? Must be some love affair - Ms. Mary - Yes? Why didn't Kowsi finish her breakfast? - Aiy-aiyo - I wonder what's the hurry? Look! Even the lunch box! Come on, Ms. Mary. Won't you check? - She forgot her lunch - She left before I could see her off - I'll hand it over on my way to work - Ok Hello sir, this is Malini, Kowsalya's class teacher Your daughter didn't turn up to school today I didn't receive any leave letter She in the 12th grade. Hence, I called you up She left for school She didn't come here Please don't mistake me for saying this, sir Your daughter... Look, stop... Miss, please don't judge her! Consider all your students as your own children Please don't tell anyone what you just told me Kowsalya, once married in front of this deity... no one can separate that couple You finally got what you wanted Anyway, God bless you You guys are my world - What do you say, Soni? - Of course Kowsalya, now take your own good time and complete your studies. I'll wait for you I don't have a good feeling about this, Senthil I have never kept any secrets from my father We will reveal it to him one day Do you think he'll agree now? Study well, become a doctor and get your dad's consent Then in presence of both our families we'll get married in a grand manner - What do you say, buddy? - Of course! It's getting late. I have applied only for half day leave Also got to go to Soni's house to change my dress - Let's start - Ok - Let's go - Please dissolve this in the pond You go do it. I'll wait here Let's go before someone sees Come on, bro! Dad! Dad! It's not like what you think Dad! I'll come home and explain I was on my way to home, next Kowsalya! Kowsalya, this was totally unexpected First, I must go home, Senthil I must meet my father My dad will understand me Dad! You look all worried. What is it? Where's my father? He left to your school to hand over your lunch box to you Didn't he return home? He left to school looking for you You demon! You've destroyed a family! Uncle! You cheated us with your sweet words! Don't be angry What do you know? He is missing! You sinner! All his struggles were for you He refused a second marriage just because he wanted to take care of you And look what you have done! Our whole family is now broken! Where will I go look for my brother now? "The one who showered love on me like rain..." "I was a big part in even the smallest of cells in you" "I'm now crying..." "All I want is you back in my life" "As my guardian angel and as the answers to all my questions" "You are my God! You are my God!" "You my world, dear father" "I am nothing without you, dear father" "You my world, dear father" "I am nothing without you, dear father" Your dad had invested in Fixed Deposit for your education... and here is a small return since it has matured "There are still many who live with superstitious beliefs" "There are still many who believe in miracles" "There is nothing more precious than the sweat a father sheds" "A father's hard work and sweat is equally powerful as a mother's milk" "There is no like you, dear father" "I am nothing without you, dear father" "You my world, dear father" "I am nothing without you, dear father" "You my world, dear father" "I am nothing without you, dear father" Look what you've done! What's the hurry to get married? First find her father and make him understand This is not a marriage without his consent "A brave heart with a beautiful smile, I'm lost for words to praise you" "I would never leave you. You would never be a burden to me" "Even when I didn't get the mother's love..." "But you loved me so much that you became my mother also" "There is no one like you, dear father" "I am nothing without you, dear father" He can't live without you Once his anger subsides, he'll come back. Now, eat dear "You my world, dear father" "I am nothing without you, dear father" "You my world, dear father" "I am nothing without you, dear father" Kowsi, I don't think we can find your father Study well and become a doctor. I'm sure he'll come back to you Don't confuse yourself Go. study well 'After few years...' Careful Slowly Sit here. I'll go give our names Ma'am... please continue these tablets which the doctor prescribed Ok Next, Mrs. Amudha... Kowsalya! Hope you are doing fine, miss What are you doing here? I... I work here Depressed, without my father... And the guilt... I couldn't concentrate on studies - Yay! I passed the exams - So did my sister My marks... were very low Muthulakshmi, quietly she topped everyone As usual Vaishnavi got second rank Look, Kowsalya's marks have gone very low Probably they didn't value the paper correctly, Kowsalya Let's go inquire in the school But I didn't write my exams well, Senthil If I had got good marks, dad might have returned home, isn't it? Look, what happened Poor Kowsalya How could've she studied when her dad is missing? I guess we took a hasty decision We made a hasty decision? He pushed us to do it! Only if he had some patience, her dad wouldn't be missing now She would also have got good marks Kowsalya was the only student who answered all my questions and took me by surprise! Stop blaming him Who expected this would happen? Senthil... Love failure isn't when a girl refuses a proposal or when we fail to marry the girl we love When we get married to the love of our life and fail to gift her a happy life... that's the true love failure Now, go and console Kowsalya Why are you both so sad all the time? It's very disheartening to see you both like this Dear, how did you even trust and fall for this fellow? Look, now you too are struggling Kowsalya, how about we take a break and go out of station? Yes, do that first My aunt stays in Madras. Go, stay there for sometime Everyone in this place looks at both of you as if you guys are criminals Take it There is Rs. 20,000/- in this - What about your vehicle's FC? - I'll manage. Have it - I shall leave now - We shall... leave tonight itself Don't leave now. Let the deity Angalamma's ritual get over in our temple Leave in the morning 5 am train I'll drop Kowsalya at her home and bring her back at early morning 4 You pack your dress and get some sleep Ok? It's beautiful but I'll accept it after I get the doctor's seat Senthil Senthil Dear sister! Senthil! Senthil Are you still asleep? Senthil! Senthil! Senthil! Brother! Why are you crying? What happened? Tell me, what is it? Senthil! What happened? Senthil! Aiyo! Senthil! Senthil! Aiy-aiyo! Senthil! Senthil! Senthil! Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad... Dad! Why daddy? Why? Why daddy? Why couldn't you focus like how Arjun focused on the parrot's eye? I don't know, dad! I have no idea why! Please dad, don't you leave me No, dad! Please! No, daddy! Please! Daddy, please don't leave me Please daddy, don't leave me Dad! Please! No! Dad! Please! No! Dad! Dad, please... Daddy! After that... I started concentrating vigorously on studies I completed my B. Sc degree winning the university gold medal I do a part time job in this hospital. I'm preparing and writing all the competitive exams And your father? Did he return home? No, miss He will never leave me He will always follow me I'm sure, even now he is present somewhere here and guarding me I couldn't fulfill his wish of me becoming a doctor But miss... I have cleared the IAS prelims now Next, I'll pass the main exam and become an IAS officer, a step ahead of what he wanted Then... my father will come in person and... he'll hug me! It's late. I shall leave now, miss But it's raining heavily, Kowsalya That's ok, miss
