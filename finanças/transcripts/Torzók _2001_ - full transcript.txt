The comrade director is expecting you... ﻿Does his mother know you brought him here? ﻿I have custody, he's my responsibility. ﻿Why were you given custody? ﻿Because the house is mine. ﻿His mother's... she can't see very well... ﻿And you brought him here. ﻿I've been trying for half a year... ﻿But he always wants to go away... ﻿back to his mother... ﻿Look, ﻿I'm a poor man. I want to remarry. ﻿I don't know what to do with him right now. ﻿I understand, but we have to notify his mother about it. ﻿Well, notify her then. ﻿- Give us her address. - I don't know her address... ﻿Then we'll find it. ﻿Believe me, it's better for you here... ﻿I'll come and take you out sometimes... ﻿Come on then.. ﻿Csontos! ﻿Ten raps on the knuckles tomorrow morning! Sit down! ﻿This is Áron Soproni. ﻿Quiet! ﻿After dinner everyone goes back to the study hall. ﻿Áron, you stay here. ﻿Sit over theee, that will be your place. ﻿Why didn't you eat? ﻿You have to eat... ﻿Things won't get better if you starve yourself... ﻿Come on, I'll show you to your bed. ﻿Come on. ﻿This is your bed. ﻿Up there? I've never slept... ﻿You'll get used to it... ﻿- What happened to your hand? - Nothing... ﻿Our Father, who art in heaven... ﻿hallowed be thy name. ﻿Thy kingdom come, thy will be done ﻿on earth as it is in Heaven. ﻿Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen. ﻿God, please let me be good. ﻿Let Grandma get better so I can get out of here... ﻿- What did they bring you in here for? - I don't know. ﻿- What do you want? - Nothing. ﻿We just want to know why you're here. ﻿But I didn't do anything! ﻿You didn't? You're lying ﻿Not anyone here gets brought in on a leash. ﻿Where are you from, which reform school? ﻿Did you steal? ﻿Get into fights? ﻿Kill someone? ﻿Come on, start talking, start talking! Be a big Boy! ﻿Stand up if you're so brave, stand up! ﻿Sooner or later you're gonna fucking tell us everything! ﻿He won't last long now, keep pushing! Faster! Faster! ﻿Get off! ﻿Get off, I said! ﻿Stupid wimp! ﻿Is he asleep? ﻿Go! Go! Go! ﻿Leave him alone! He's not moving! ﻿Just a little more... ﻿Okay, that's enough. ﻿He's not crying! ﻿He's one of us now. ﻿What are you doing over there? ﻿Quit! ﻿Fingernails! ﻿Mr. Csapó, reporting for punishment, Sir! ﻿Later. ﻿They're dirty, Hajós! ﻿I was helping Uncle Józsi carry up the coal... ﻿You're lying! ﻿Let's double the amount then, shall we? ﻿Teeth! ﻿What are you stretching your neck for? ﻿You ate poppy seeds! ﻿Brush them again! ﻿So you're the new boy?! ﻿What's that blood on your ear? ﻿Yes? ﻿What happened? ﻿Answer when I ask you a question! ﻿Did someone hurt you? ﻿No. I just never slept in a bunk bed before... ﻿Dear Mommy. ﻿I'm scared very much here. ﻿It's so good I can write you at last. ﻿I miss you very very much. ﻿The only good thing about this institution is ﻿that they found you. ﻿I hope you are well and your eyes're getting better. ﻿I wish you could come and see me soon... ﻿Sure thing. She'll rush in... ﻿Kids are so stupid here... and wicked... ﻿The teachers don't like me. ﻿I don't like them, either. They haven't hurt me yet. ﻿The time will come, boy... ﻿I've not been hit on my fingernails, either. ﻿- We'll cross that out... - I don't have any friends. ﻿Mother! You will visit me on Sunday, won't you? ﻿The twenty minutes are up. Please bring some sweets. ﻿Millions of kisses, your loving son, Áron. ﻿A good thing the walls aren't white as snow. ﻿If you're really scared we could swap beds... ﻿No... I'm not scared. ﻿Do you pray, too? ﻿No, but my father taught me a rhyme... ﻿Let's hear it! ﻿Now I lay me down to sleep, like a pig in mud so deep. ﻿God damn am I freezing cold, good night, good night I'm told. ﻿Not bad! As a matter of fact, it's quite good. We'll use it. ﻿Now I lay me down to sleep, like a pig... ﻿How does it go? ﻿Four times seven? ﻿Twenty... six! ﻿One more time. Four times seven. ﻿- Twenty... eight! - At last! Six times seven? ﻿- He's Nyitrai. - Who? ﻿Nyitrai. He used to be an astronomer in Budapest. ﻿He's done time for political reasons, like my father. ﻿He got out a few months ago. He has a little girl. ﻿- She came to see him once but they... - Heltai! ﻿Out here! ﻿Go sit down. ﻿- What was that whispering? - We were talking about stars. ﻿You can't talk about stars here. ﻿Is that clear? ﻿Everyone is to write this down ﻿and solve it. ﻿Well...? Heltai? ﻿Are you finished yet? ﻿All right. ﻿This is what I got, because of this. ﻿What does that remind you of? ﻿This is how many of you there are in this school. ﻿This is the number of weeks in a year, and ﻿that's how many months your father's got left in prison. ﻿Áron...! Áron...! ﻿My son! ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿- Go back to your dorm. - I had a bad dream. ﻿You're not alone. ﻿What's that over there? ﻿A telescope. ﻿It's really big...! Is that what you gaze at the stars with? ﻿- Not any more! - Never? ﻿Never. Now... Go back to bed.. ﻿Could I have a look? ﻿You really must have had a bad dream... ﻿Well, all right, just this once. ﻿You won't see much because of the bars. ﻿That's okay... ﻿- It's like the barrel of a tank... - Except we shoot for the stars... ﻿Like this... ﻿I can't see anything but a big blur. ﻿You can bring it into focus with this. ﻿They're so close! This is fantastic! ﻿Slow down. ﻿Now look for the brightest star. ﻿It's to the right, above the broken tree branch. ﻿Found it! ﻿That's the North Star. ﻿That's where our adventures begin. ﻿Where's the Dipper? ﻿There are two of them: the Great and the Little. ﻿- Which one do you want? - The Great Dipper. ﻿Right now it's farther to the North and a little to the right. ﻿It consists of seven stars ﻿but you can only see them one at a time. ﻿They're so shiny! South of that is Cepheus. ﻿But that's the moon! ﻿A little to the left is his wife ﻿Cassiopeia, ﻿the queen, shaped like a "w". ﻿They have a little girl ﻿whose name is Andromeda. ﻿Okay, enough for now. ﻿Put that back! ﻿I wasn't going to steal it, I just wanted to look at it... ﻿Steal it? ﻿You wouldn't have any use for it. It's a meteorite. ﻿Do you know what that is? ﻿A stone from space. ﻿A piece of the sun? ﻿Just a rock. ﻿But it saved my life. ﻿Where's it from? ﻿I found it during my first walk in a yard where no grass grows. ﻿The prison yard? ﻿How do you know about that? ﻿From the boys... ﻿The boys... ﻿If you really are interested in stars ﻿you can have that map. ﻿But take good care of it, ﻿I got it from my daughter. ﻿Now get to bed. ﻿STOREROOM ﻿Shut up! ﻿I wish I was soap lather... ﻿...or a stream of water... ﻿Look at those tits! ﻿Well, Áron, do you like what you see? ﻿All right, that's enough. ﻿No, don't... no! ﻿Well, Máté, you can go to confession now. ﻿- But not a word about this! - Like the Virgin Mother... ﻿Don't make me laugh... ﻿- They'll be looking for us. - They can kiss my... ﻿What's wrong with you? ﻿I want to touch her. The way she is, naked... ﻿You can't. She's mine.. ﻿North... ﻿No, ﻿that's not right... ﻿North... No... ﻿North! ﻿Cepheus, ﻿Cassiopeia... ﻿Cassiopeia! ﻿I found you! ﻿It really does look like a "w". This is a baby. ﻿A baby? Are you crazy? This, a baby? ﻿It doesn't even have any hair! Who told you that? ﻿- My brother. - You don't even have a brother! ﻿I do too, and he's not stupid. He knows... ﻿How'd you do it? ﻿It doesn't even smell like a baby. ﻿- So? It's still what a baby's made from. - That?! ﻿- You said it was a baby. - Right... No, no! ﻿Believe me, this is what a baby's made from! ﻿Well, Hajós, maybe that's what you're made of, but not me. ﻿Line up! ﻿Four to the left, three to the right! ﻿It's gone! ﻿It's gone! The baby's gone! ﻿Misi, Misi, do you hear me? It's gone... ﻿Again. Once more! ﻿Again. ﻿Come on, Csontos, this is the least you can expect ﻿for throwing bread around. With your mouth only! ﻿Not to worry, dear colleague. You've seen worse, haven't you? ﻿Stand up! ﻿You can only eat it if you reach it! ﻿I'm not hungry any more. ﻿You're going to eat it anyway. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Come on... ﻿Eat. It can't go on like this any longer. ﻿I did it to teach him a lesson. ﻿That was no teaching method. ﻿- That was pure cruelty. - That's where you're wrong. ﻿It does make a difference how we educate them. ﻿With your mentality they wouldn't survive out there. ﻿It's a cruel world, in case you haven't noticed. ﻿I know more about that than you do. ﻿But these are kids... ﻿I've been doing this for 20 years. ﻿I know what they think, I know what they feel. ﻿I know their most secret desires. ﻿And I'm the one who's with them during the breaks, ﻿while you go off with your cello somewhere. ﻿You hate kids. ﻿I hate myself enough to outlive you... ﻿I want to enjoy my hatred a while longer. ﻿The next time you interfere with my methods ﻿I'm having you taken back right where you came from. ﻿Gentlemen, please... ﻿- Did it hurt a lot? - I could've taken the jumping a while longer... ﻿- You shouldn't have tried to be a hero! - Shut up, okay? ﻿You always want to be something different, you stupid Gipsy... ﻿- Your mother's a Gipsy! - She's dead. - Stop it, will you...? Give her a hug... hug your mother... don't pull away, you hear?! ﻿Áron, ﻿my son... your face is so thin... ﻿Don't pull away, you hear me?! ﻿- What is it? What do you want? - Nothing. ﻿- Today is my birthday, again. - Hooray! Hooray! ﻿Who wants a ride on the motorbike? ﻿All right, but only one person can go. ﻿One at a time, you know that. ﻿Whoever gets back first with a piece of coal gets to go. ﻿On you marks, get set, go! ﻿- Go, Hajós! - Come on guys! ﻿Hurry up! ﻿Stay back. You hear me? Stay back! I must win! ﻿I'll kick the crap out of you. ﻿- Stop! - Fuck you! ﻿Okay, Áron, ﻿you can sit behind me. ﻿You mother fucker! ﻿Now I can wait another half year until his name day! ﻿Leave him alone. ﻿I'm sick of you being the boss around here! Did you tell him... ﻿- I forgot. - You bastard! ﻿Don't you mess with me, damn it, don't mess with me! ﻿That's enough! ﻿What's this? Get to bed! ﻿Hajós, come with me! ﻿It smells so bad in here even my watch stopped running. Open a window. ﻿Take off your nightgown. ﻿These underpants are too worn, I've told you before. ﻿Here's a new pair, ﻿put them on. ﻿Put them on! ﻿What are you waiting for? ﻿Come here! ﻿Closer! ﻿Come on, come on. ﻿Don't worry, I won't hurt you. ﻿- You've been smoking. - No! I haven't! ﻿You will be honest with me, now won't you? Do you like it here? ﻿- What about your brother? - Nothing. ﻿Are you sure? ﻿He's being put in a boy's home. ﻿I could pull some strings and have him sent here... ﻿Could you, Mr. Csapó? Could you do that? ﻿You tell me about everything that goes on in here. ﻿Only me. ﻿I'll even take you for a ride on the motorbike ﻿one day. ﻿All right, off with you now. ﻿I have to write that down.. ﻿The walls are white.. ﻿The walls... ﻿Cut it out, you know you're not allowed. What are the candles for? ﻿It's All Soul's Day. ﻿Cut it out, hear me...? ﻿The director's on duty. We'll be all fucked because of you. ﻿Christ the Lord, our loving Father, ﻿I stand before you with the trust of a child and ask you ﻿to free my father and mother, and forgive their sins, ﻿some of which might have been committed because of me. ﻿Please admit them to the glory of Heaven... ﻿- Why don't you pray silently, to yourself? - He has to hear you. ﻿He doesn't hear you. ﻿- He hears me. I can feel it. - There is no God! Understand? ﻿Nor will there ever be! ﻿You need to look for a large white spot, like a lopsided circle. ﻿Some have several moons... ﻿Could that be where God lives? ﻿Look for him. ﻿I can't find him.. ﻿I couldn't either. And I've been looking for thirty years... ﻿But could He be there? ﻿All there is up there is dust and gasses. ﻿It's extremely cold among the stars, ﻿minus 270 degrees. ﻿But most of all, there's nothing. ﻿Then He doesn't even exist? ﻿I don't believe so. ﻿But then why does Máté pray? To whom? Máté says he feels God. Why don't I? ﻿Do you? ﻿Me? ﻿No... ﻿But there's got to be something! ﻿That's true... ﻿It should be. ﻿And maybe for you it's still possible. ﻿I'm sure there's a place or a person ﻿- that is your innermost home... - So then He does exist... ﻿If he does, ﻿He is also in this. ﻿In that? ﻿Don't you understand? It's not the rock that's important... ﻿It's really heavy... ﻿God does not exist. ﻿Keep going! ﻿Don't even think of stopping before a hundred! ﻿Is that it? ﻿You do know that you can't write for another two weeks, don't you? ﻿There is no God and I won't pray to Him anymore. ﻿The twenty minutes are up. ﻿"They give us enough to eat here. ﻿I got a beating again but it doesn't matter. ﻿We can hardly wait for the snow so we can make a huge snowman ﻿with a gigantic carrot for a nose. Then I'll eat the carrot. ﻿I like carrots, ﻿Take care of yourself and write soon. Csontos." ﻿There's no salutation again. ﻿No what? ﻿Salutation. Like "Dear Brother..." ﻿or whatever his name is. Balázs. ﻿Then write: "Dear Balázs". ﻿And cross out the part about the beating. ﻿I said cross it out. ﻿- "Snowman" isn't capitalized. - But it's a person, a name! ﻿I said it's not capitalized. ﻿And don't sign "Csontos", sign your Christian name: Laci. ﻿But everyone calls me Csontos. ﻿What did he call you? ﻿I don't remember... ﻿Pegasus! ﻿Orion! ﻿I found you! You can't hide from me! ﻿Dear Grandma, I dream about them more and more often. ﻿Maybe if I had been in the car, ﻿the accident wouldn't have happened and Mom and Dad would ﻿still be alive. You said Jesus watches over me, ﻿so they would still be alive. ﻿Why was I at your house then? ﻿I don't remember. ﻿I celebrated All Soul's Day... ﻿This kid's driving me crazy! ﻿Nothing's enough for him! ﻿You can't send this report. ﻿What do you care about him? ﻿You're ruining his life just because he prays? ﻿He's toying with my job! If Csapó finds out I haven't sent it, ﻿I've had it! He censored it... ﻿At least cross out that one sentence! ﻿I most certainly will not! ﻿Four years ago you would have... for me... ﻿Four years ago... ﻿Here, you cross it out! ﻿Go ahead! ﻿If you're so brave... ﻿You can come into me, ﻿if you still want to... ﻿Don't lose track now, there's to be twenty-six of each. ﻿This is only twenty-four. ﻿Did you hit yourself? ﻿Let me see.. ﻿- Hey, what are you doing...? - Kiss me... ﻿- Are you crazy? - Why? ﻿You do it with the director! ﻿- I saw you doing it! - Spying on me, were you? ﻿- You whore! - Miss Marika, stop! Stop! ﻿- Sneaky, aren't you? You whore! - Just like my mother! ﻿What the hell do you know? ﻿Do you ever see your daughter? ﻿No. ﻿She lives with my wife in another town, ﻿far from here. ﻿How old is she? ﻿7. ﻿Why are you so interested? ﻿I don't know... ﻿Why do you come here? Who sent you? ﻿No one. ﻿Father, ﻿we had our pictures taken. ﻿Everyone had to smile. ﻿I didn't feel like it. ﻿Then I thought you might be happy if I did... ﻿You can be cute if you want to, son... ﻿My best friend's name is Áron. ﻿Who's your best friend now? ﻿- Friend... - I miss you very much, Father! ﻿Hugs and kisses, your son, Attila. ﻿Christmas is coming so I will draw you something. ﻿- Can you guess what it is? - This is a cunt! What a pig! ﻿Sending that to his father in prison! ﻿Cut off the folded part ﻿and fold the paper in half. ﻿Twist the top part around	a pencil and move it up and down fast. ﻿Damn... Over here! Get him! ﻿- I bet you can't get me! - Right here! ﻿Go on now! ﻿You are to bring a crate of coal from the store room. ﻿Not a piece should fall out, otherwise no one goes home for Christmas. ﻿All right. You can get up new. ﻿I said, get up! ﻿Everyone can go home. ﻿Except Seprődi, Váradi, Hajós and Máté. ﻿And you. ﻿You can't home like that. ﻿Here. ﻿This is ﻿my gift to the gang... ﻿Go ahead, open it! ﻿Well, what is it, little monkeys...? ﻿God of comfort, God of mercy, ﻿look upon your poor child with merciful eyes, ﻿who, left alone in this world ﻿puts all his trust in your mercy. ﻿Dear Heavenly Father, give me a peaceful and patient heart ﻿amidst all of life's bitterness. ﻿Let me understand that I will not be alone, ﻿that your watchful eyes are always upon me. ﻿I gratefully see, dear God, that you have provided people ﻿who are good to me out of their love for you, ﻿and in this way almost substitute my poor parents. ﻿You said, God, that a mother sooner forgets her own son ﻿than You forget your children. ﻿- That's why I place all my faith in you... - What is this? ﻿I therefore place all my trust... ﻿Please don't forget... ﻿- Stop that! - ...and lead me... ﻿- Shut your mouth, you wretch... - ...under your protection... ﻿Shut up! ﻿You can't pray here, understand? ﻿You want to send me to jail? You stinker... ﻿No praying, no praying, no praying! ﻿Are you still here? ﻿Back to your beds, all of you! ﻿What did I say! ﻿Back to bed! ﻿Understand? Hear me? ﻿Get to bed! Get to bed! ﻿I have faith in you and will never be disappointed in you. ﻿I want to live and die under your holy protection... Amen... ﻿You too! ﻿You're Jewish! Your grandparents died in Auschwitz. ﻿All right, ﻿you'll beat him up, you were the ones listening... ﻿Line up! In front of your beds! ﻿Horinka, ﻿the lash! ﻿You start! And don't be gentle! ﻿- I can't hit him. - Then he will, and that's worse for Máté! Seprődi! ﻿Again! ﻿Harder! Don't you dare turn away! ﻿Well, come on, or do you want a turn too? ﻿- I'm going to escape. - How the fuck d'you wanna do that? ﻿- I don't know yet. - But there's got to be a way... ﻿Others have tried, but they were all brought back. ﻿I don't care. I want to see my mother... ﻿I'm game. I'll go with you. ﻿So will I. ﻿- Me, too. - Me, too. ﻿- I can't go. - Chicken. ﻿Because of my father, shithead... ﻿Let's go, dickheads, what the fuck are we waiting for? ﻿Come on! Fly Áron, fly! Áron! Áron! ﻿Wake up! ﻿- What is it? - We're going! ﻿- Going? Now? - Csapó's on duty! ﻿He took Horinka to the hospital, he was coughing blood. ﻿- Give me my shoes! - Cut it out! Cut the crap! ﻿- Where the hell is my hat? - Up my ass! ﻿- I'm going too! - I was hoping you would. ﻿- Where are the matches? - I couldn't get any! ﻿- What? Aren't you coming? - I don't know where we're going. ﻿So? We're leaving, that's all ﻿- You're chicken! - I'm not chicken. I'm just not going. ﻿I don't! ﻿Don't fucking come then! You go back to sleep! ﻿- We made it! We're free! - Yeah! We made it! Fuck you Csapó! ﻿- Macaroni is for dinner today... - Shut up or I'll punch you! ﻿Cut it out, guys! ﻿Shit! Someone's coming! ﻿Get down, get down! Misi! ﻿He's never going to pay it back... ﻿He set his dog on me. And his wife encouraged him. ﻿She's real trash she is. ﻿During grape harvest she started flirting with Bandi ﻿and then poured a bucket of rotten grapes down his back... Just some animal... ...and almost pushed him in the press... ﻿We'll reach the river by the afternoon. ﻿The town's not far from there. ﻿We have to get out of these uniforms. ﻿What for? We'll still look the same! ﻿See this? Everything worked out ﻿because this was protecting us. ﻿What the fuck is this? ﻿It's a... ...a tiny star. From space. ﻿- A meteorite. - A what? A meteorite. That's what it's called. ﻿From space? ﻿Sure! ﻿You stupid animal, get it out, damn it! ﻿Are you orazy? Leave me alone! ﻿Get it out, damn it! It's important to me! ﻿You're gonna take it out of the fire, understand? You bastard! ﻿- Get it out, damn it! - Stop it! Look! Look! ﻿Leave me alone! ﻿It's putting the fire out... ﻿It's cold as ice.. ﻿It is... ﻿Wake up! The cops are here! Out the back window! Out! ﻿Get up! ﻿Don't move... ﻿Don't move... ﻿You should be looking for the kids instead. You ﻿should know that better than me. ﻿You're the one who knows their souls and innermost desires, aren't you? ﻿God damn! ﻿Careful! ﻿This is where it's the narrowest, let's cross here. ﻿This is dangerous. Let's not do it. ﻿But ﻿we agreed, didn't we? ﻿Okay, ﻿I'm going. ﻿Hey, we agreed on the order and I'm first! ﻿You come last, you're the lightest. ﻿And besides, you're watched over. ﻿Fuck! ﻿Cross carefully... ﻿This cold is nothing. ﻿Up there, among the stars, it's minus 270 degrees. ﻿Leave me alone. I'm gonna freeze to death. ﻿Máté! ﻿Máté! ﻿Come beside me. ﻿Come on...! ﻿Don't be scared. ﻿The others are waiting on the other side, see? ﻿Go on. I'll go ﻿last then... ﻿What are you guys doing? Stop fucking around! ﻿Oh my God... ﻿Áron! Help! Áron! Get me out! ﻿Come on! ﻿Get me out! ﻿Help! Áron! Help! ﻿- Get me out! - Lie down on the ice. ﻿Get me out... ﻿Hold on, we're coming! Hold on! Hold on! ﻿- I got you... I got you... - Get me out, God damn it! ﻿- Get me out! - Don't worry... ﻿Help! ﻿Help! ﻿Attila! Máté! ﻿Máté! Máté! ﻿Attila...! ﻿Leave me alone! Leave me alone! ﻿No... Attila! We can't save him! We can't save him! ﻿- Máté, come on. Please... - Attila... ﻿Máté... ﻿Máté...! ﻿Please... pray! ﻿Pray! ﻿Now, now, damn it! Why the hell don't you feel it now? ﻿Why don't you feel it? Pray! For yourself... for Attila... ﻿Leave him alone. ﻿You should be feeling it now... ﻿God... God... ﻿God, please make him get better... ﻿Please help him get better... ﻿And if you do exist make him get better and let him live... ﻿- Bring Attila back... - We have to get him to a doctor. ﻿Where did you want to go, anyway? Where? ﻿You call this gratitude? ﻿Who came up with the idea? ﻿Step forward! ﻿It's not fair to punish a single person for what happened. ﻿I don't care what the hell you think, Nyitrai! ﻿We've made mistakes too. ﻿All right then, who came up with the idea of escaping? ﻿Boys, ﻿you'd better tell me. ﻿If you tell me, the others won't get such a tough punishment. ﻿It was me. ﻿You? ﻿Are you aware that Máté is lying in the hospital sick, with a very ﻿high fever, because of you? And Heltai died because of you? ﻿You'd better get used to the idea of being a murderer. ﻿A murderer... ﻿Nyitrai! Come... ﻿Come, now... ﻿Come... Let me out! Let me out of here! ﻿Mr. Józsi, let me out! ﻿Let me out! ﻿Mother, ﻿I didn't kill him! ﻿It wasn't me! Was it...? It wasn't me! ﻿It wasn't me... ﻿It wasn't me... ﻿I hope you've found the time to think things through. ﻿We're taking you to a stricter facility today. ﻿There's no escaping from there. ﻿You can go now. ﻿Go on! ﻿Come. ﻿Miss Marika, I'd like to leave this map of the stars here for ﻿Máté... ﻿Okay... ﻿What happened, Mr. Józsi? ﻿Nyitrai died. ﻿Hung himself. ﻿Maybe he got some bad news from home. ﻿I have to pee. ﻿Go ahead. ﻿Mother! You will see me, won't you? ﻿I would be so happy... ﻿They will make you get better, right? ﻿They're taking me to another institute today, ﻿I can only have visitors every three months there. ﻿I'm bald. ﻿I thought one of us would make it home. ﻿Máté is still in the hospital. ﻿His fever went down but he doesn't recognize anyone. ﻿Not even his grandmother. ﻿He just sits and prays. ﻿The Credo. ﻿Attila died... ﻿because of me.
