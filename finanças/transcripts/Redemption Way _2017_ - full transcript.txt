(mellow music) - Yes, yes, this is Gwen Pluth. Right. Right, well, my doctor hasn't gotten paid. We met the deductible, yes. I've called four times on this. Okay, okay. Alright. (bright music) Thank you. (girls giggling) No, no, no, no, no. Autumn. - Jen, back to earth. - Sorry. Stop, you can't look! - Yes, I can. - It's not fair, you can't look. - Yes, I can, there is no rule against it. - Todd! - You can't cover my eyes. - Yes, I can, there's no rule against it. (clicking) (clicking) I can't concentrate. - Tough decision? (cell phone ringing) You're not getting out of this one that easy. - What are you talking about? I'm winning. Hello, this is Jenny. Uh huh. Yeah, okay, I can be there in 15 minutes, no problem. I gotta go. - Seriously? - Yeah, hopefully I won't be long. Hey, no peeking. (upbeat music) Hey, how are you? (upbeat music) - Is she in any pain? I didn't know what to do. Please, do something for her. - I don't think she's in any physical pain, but I need you to stay calm, she's very anxious right now. Can you get the box of medicine from the fridge for me? Hey, it's okay Cynthia. Hey, it's Jenny, your nurse. I need you to breathe with me, okay? Good. - And what if this doesn't work? - We're gonna take this one step at a time. I need you to trust me, okay? Hey, Cynthia, we're gonna get through this. I'm giving her lorazepam, this is going to help calm her. Open. God, give me the strength to help calm her. Good, good, good. Good, good, good. Can I pray for you? Heavenly Father, I pray for peace and comfort for Cynthia right now. Lord, we know her discomfort is only temporary, if she trusts in you. I pray she would feel your presence and an overwhelming sense of peace. In Jesus' name I pray, amen. (church bells ringing) - So how was work? - It's going really well. - Oh my goodness, I don't know how you do it. - Well, she was born to do it. - It takes someone special to do what you do. - I just tell people it's like being a labor and delivery nurse, just delivering to the next life. (cell phone ringing) It's my mom again, I'd better get this, excuse me. Hey, mom. What? Is dad okay? Okay. Mm hmm. Yeah. - What happened? (somber music) - I can't stop thinking about where my dad is right now. - We don't know what was in his heart. - Why does God place such a burden on us? - Uncle Ed, you are looking like a million bucks. After taxes. - Funny guy. How's work? - Good, keeping busy. - Good, good. They did a good job with his makeup, didn't they? He looked peaceful. - I sure hope he is. Excuse me, I need some fresh air. - Speak of the devil. - Autumn! - Hey. - What are you doing here? - Hey. - I ran into her mom the other day at the store. I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you. - Are you back in town for a while? - Yeah, um, I am so sorry for your loss. - Thanks. Thanks for coming. - Yeah. - When was the last time you two saw each other? - It's been, a while. - Yeah. - Well, come on in, we got plenty of food. - Uh mom, can you give us a sec? - Oh, okay, it was good seeing you. - You too, Gwen. - It's so good to see you. I tried calling a few times. - I know. - Why didn't you-- - I'm sorry, I, things have just been a little, crazy lately. So, how's Todd? - He's good. Work's been a little slow. He stays busy though, he just finished a big project at church, so. - Still doing the church thing, huh? - Yeah. - Um, I know you guys were trying last time we talked, any luck? - No, not yet. Hopefully soon, though. - Yeah. - How about you, are you seeing anyone? - No, no. - Enjoy being single, you've got time. (sharply inhales) Are you okay? - Yeah, no, I'm, I'm good, fine. I actually have to get going. - You just got here, come in for a bit. - I can't, I'm sorry, I, I have some stuff I gotta take care of. - There you are. - Todd, look who's here. - Autumn, hi, good to see you. - Yeah, good to see you too, um, so sorry, I gotta run, but it was really good to see you guys. - Everything okay? - Yeah, not sure. - Your mom's looking for you, we're ready. - Thank you, everyone, for coming. Jenny's going to say grace. She's the designated saint in the family. - Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for this time we have to celebrate dad's life. We miss him so much. We thank you for the time you gave us with him. I pray for your peace and comfort on this sad day. In Jesus' name I pray, amen. - Amen. - He's in a better place now. - Is he? Based on what, mom? - Forget it, this isn't the time or place. - Dad's memorial service isn't the time or place to grieve for him or consider where he went? - Jen! - We're here to pay respect to your father. This isn't about your religion. - I'm sick of pretending everything's okay. What if he's not in a better place? - That's enough! - Jenny, where are you going? - I can't do this. - Babe, come on. You're upset, you both said things you didn't mean. - I'm not going back in there. - Give her a minute to cool down. - Please give me the keys. - You're upset, you shouldn't be driving. - I'm fine, I just need to take a walk, okay? I want to start planning for a family. - We are a family. - You know what I mean. I want kids, Todd. I don't think I can wait any longer. I really think we should adopt. - I want to adopt too, but it's not the right time. How are we gonna afford it? We can barely get by as it is. - Well, we're not getting any younger. - I don't want our kids growing up in the same environment like I did. I want to be financially stable first. - When's that gonna be? - I'm doing the best I can, you know. - I know. What if I get that promotion? Can we then? - We'll see, we have to run the numbers first. - I already did, do you wanna see? I created a detailed budget based off of my potential raise, my Christmas bonus, our tax return, and the money that we have in savings. And there's some really great grants that I think we could qualify for. - I mean, it could work, if the numbers are right. - Hey, Jenny, how was your weekend? Mine was terrible, Mrs. Epstein's daughter had me there until three in the morning, on a Saturday! That woman is driving me nuts. Everything's an emergency with her. And on top that, I only got two hours of sleep. My husband snores like a bear. I keep telling him, "You need to get a CPAP." But does he listen to me? Typical guy for you though, huh? Adoption? What, you can't get pregnant? - It's none of your business. Please don't take things off my desk. - Well, it ain't cheap to adopt, you know? - I know, that's why I need this promotion. - What promotion? - I'm sorry, Barbara's waiting on me. - Okay, um, uh huh, sure. Uh huh, three weeks, okay. Uh huh, got it. If you get the information, I can take care of it by next week, thanks. Hey, how was your dad's service? - Uh, okay, I had some family issues. - I'm sorry to hear it. You could have taken more time off, if you wanted. - No, I'd be thinking about it all day. Maybe it's better I'm at work keeping busy. - I understand, denial is part of the grieving process. So what's up? - I was wondering if you've given any more thought to that promotion. - Corporate wants me to interview a few more people before I make my decision. Standard procedure, it's a formality really. You'd be a perfect fit for it. - That's great, because I really feel like I would excel at this position. I have ideas on how to improve our patient care and tighten up compliance with the regs. - Okay, good, I'm hoping to make my decision in a couple weeks and I'll let you know. - Thanks. - Sorry to hear about your dad. - Thanks. - How's your mom handling it? - Okay, they got divorced a while back, so. - That's good. Hey, thanks for letting me know about that promotion. Nothing like a little competition, right? - What? - The director's position. I'm interviewing for it tomorrow. You're not mad, are you? - No, of course not. - We're ready to get started. We have three new patients this week. Jenny, I want you to take the first one. Marilyn, why don't you brief us on Autumn. - Sure, let's see, patient's name is Autumn Cooper. She's 28 years old, she has end stage leukemia, and she's comfortable at this point. - I did the initial assessment yesterday. Patient refused further spiritual care, but God has His own ways. - Jenny, it'll be okay. Take a drink of water, water helps. Here, here. Take this, drink, good, good. Okay, now, please breathe slowly. Deep breaths. Are you gonna be okay? Okay. You've got nothing to worry about, Jenny. Obviously, there's a conflict of interest here, so you won't be taking the case. - I'd be happy to take her, Barb. My case load's pretty low. - Thanks, Mare. Why don't you take the rest of the day off? Go home, relax. Your friend's in good hands. - Yeah. - I'm so sorry to hear about your friend, Jenny. Don't worry, I'll take good care of her. (deeply exhales) (girls giggling) (cell phone ringing) (somber music) - Hey. - Hey. - What you doing home? - I left early. - What happened? - Autumn's on hospice. - Your friend Autumn? What's wrong with her? - She has leukemia. - So she's back home now? - Yeah, I think so. Why is all this happening to me? - I don't know why, babe. Thanks for dinner. - Yeah, sure. - What you thinkin' about? - Autumn. God's brought her back into my life for a reason. I feel like He's giving me a second chance. I think I need to go there, now. - Okay, you sure now's the right time, though? - Yeah, I need to help her. - I've always admired your passion. It's one of the many reasons I married you. But can't we have dessert first? - Pray for me? - Of course I will, I love you. - Love you too. (light music) (cell phone pings) - Hi Jenny, it's Pastor Greg. I just wanted to let you know that I'm here, if you need to talk. (light music) - Jenny? Jenny Pluth? - Hi, Mrs. C. - How are you? - Hangin' in there. - It's great to see you. - I'm sorry to intrude, were you headed out? - Oh, it's no problem. You're always welcome here, any time. I was just heading to the store, it can wait, really. Come on in! I haven't seen you in so long. - Where's Mr. C? - Working late. What have you been doing with yourself these days? Autumn said you were married. - Yeah, almost five years. - Good for you, are you working? - Yeah, I'm a hospice nurse. - Oh, we just signed Autumn up for hospice. - I know, I work for New Hope. - Are you her nurse? - No, I couldn't, conflict of interest. - Oh. - When was Autumn diagnosed? - Almost two years ago. She's had, let's see, three rounds of chemo, countless blood transfusions. Even a clinical trial. Now we're here. - How is she holding up? - She's tired a lot, really weak. She's not eating much. - I'm here for you guys. If you ever have any questions, or if you just need someone to talk to, let me know. - Thanks. I moved Autumn to my room. You know where it is. - And when I got back he was gone. I can't imagine where he'd gone to. - He was in here just a minute ago. (knocking on door) - Jenny! - Hey, how are you? - Um, (deeply exhales), pretty, pretty awful, actually. Nothing pretty about it, just, just awful. You can grab a chair, just put those clothes on the floor. - Still don't put your laundry away, huh? - Shut up, I have a legitimate excuse now. Oh no, no, don't do that. - It's fine, I don't mind. - Did my mom call you or something? - No, I found out today at a work meeting, of all places. - Sorry. Are you my nurse? - No. Why didn't you tell me, Autumn? - I didn't, I didn't wanna be a burden. It's not like we've really been talking lately, so I... - I'm so sorry. Hey, you looked good at dad's service. - Yeah, well, I only bust out the wig for really important occasions. - How are you feeling now? - I'm, I have some good days. And bad. Mostly bad. - I'm here for you, okay? Whatever you need. - Thanks. - How are you doing spiritually? - Um, you know me, I'm more science than religion. - Are you scared? - Um, I don't know. Not really. Whatever's next has gotta be better than this. - Going to the store, need anything else? - Pistachio pudding. (doorbell rings) I don't, I don't really feel up to seeing anyone else today, mom, I'm really tired. - Okay, hon. It was great seeing you, Jenny. - You too, Mrs. C. You need any water or anything? - No, no, just waiting on that pudding. - Okay, well, I didn't want to stay long. I'll let you rest. - I get tired so easily now. It's really frustrating. - I'll stop by tomorrow, if you want. - No, you don't, you don't have to do that. - I want to, I can bring you dinner or something. What would you like? - Mashed potatoes and creamed corn. - You got it. Oh, I almost forgot. I got this for you. I thought it might answer some questions you may have. Come on, humor me at least. You never know, it might help. - Okay. Fine. - I love you, Autumn. - Love you too. Thanks, Jenny. - (knocking) Sorry, I didn't want to interrupt. Hi, I'm Marilyn, your hospice nurse. - I was just leaving, take care. - Thanks. - How are you feeling today? - How's she doing? - Someone her age doesn't go on hospice until they've been through every possible treatment. She maybe has a month. - That's it? - She's gonna decline fast, too. - She believe in God? - No, and I don't want to make the same mistake I did with my dad, but I don't wanna regret not doing or saying something that could change her eternity. (mellow music) - Aw. - Smells good, what are we having? - Hey, sorry, it's for Autumn. I'm headed over there in a bit. - What, but what am I supposed to eat? - There are leftovers in the fridge. - Nah. - I can put a pizza in, if you'd like. - Thank you. - Hey, can you do the dishes? I'm not sure what time I'm headed back tonight. - Sure. - Pizza will be ready in a few minutes, I set a timer. - Okay, thanks. - I don't know if I can do this. I am so nervous. I'm not sure what to say to her. - Why not just be there for her? She'll experience Jesus through your actions, not your words. - Will she? My dad didn't. - Share your story. Ask her what she believes. You can't change her, only God can. And He's got His own plans for her. - Maybe. - My appetite does not accurately reflect the quality of these potatoes. - I'm glad you liked them. (cell phone ringing) So, can I ask how your doctor's appointment went? - Yeah, she said I'll probably be declining pretty quickly. She thinks two months, but I think she was being generous. - Did you get a new book? - Yeah, yeah, my mom got it for me. - What's it about? - It's an analysis of a bunch of different accounts of near death experiences from like all over the world. And it's still theoretical, but it's pretty interesting. - Why did we stop being friends? - What do you mean? - Why did you stop calling? Why didn't you return my calls? - Ever since you became a Christian, things have been different. You really changed. And I just didn't think we had anything in common anymore. - Really? I do see things differently, but that doesn't change our friendship. You've always been my best friend, Autumn. - I, I, I know your faith is based on something real for you but, I never felt anything like that. And I've never felt, I've never found any evidence that God even exists. - Well, in the Bible-- - Outside of the Bible, Jenny. And if there is a God, I really don't think He cares about me. - Autumn, He does care about you. I know that He does, and He loves you and He wants what's best for you. - Could have fooled me. Can we talk about something else? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Hey, do you remember that time my dad took us to Glacier Park and we found those shiny stones by the swings? He told us that story about the pirate and the lost treasure. - Yeah, didn't we take the stones back to your parents' house in a plastic baggie and bury them in the backyard? - With the treasure map! - Ah, the treasure map. - Did I ever tell you that my dad planned that whole thing? - What? - He brought fool's gold and he scattered it so we would find it. - No! - Yeah! - (laughing) I wonder, I wonder if it's still there. - I have no idea where we put that treasure map. - Well, at least the gold is safe, right? - Of course, it's in a plastic baggie. (laughing) - It seems like yesterday. Everything changes so fast. - As all of you know, this is the first time I've ever held political office, but I'm gonna do the very best I can. (applause) Mayberry is a fine little town but I think we can make it even better. I think the important thing to remember is this, what government on any level is-- - Jenny, Jenny. It's late. - What time is it? - Two in the morning. Thank you so much for everything you're doing for Autumn. It's so great to have you around again. - It's so good to be around again. - Bye honey, drive safe. (Jenny sighs) - 200,000 acres. Some of the richest land in California, in the hands of two unlikely heirs. - Hey, what time is it? Everything okay? - No, it's not. I asked you to do the dishes. - Sorry, I fell asleep watching TV. - It must be nice. - What's that supposed to mean? - I can't do everything around here. - You're the one spending all the time with Autumn. It would be nice if you were around here every once in a while. - Seriously, you're giving me a guilt trip about being with my dying friend? - No, that's not what I meant. It's late, I'm going to bed. (cell phone ringing) - Hello? - Jenny, where have you been? I've been trying to get a hold of you all morning. - What, what time is it ? - It's close to 11. You've already missed two visits. - Oh no, I am so sorry. - I want you to come right to the office. We need to talk. - Okay, I'll be right there. (knocking) You wanted to see me? - Come in. What's going on with you lately? - I overslept, I was at Autumn's late. It won't happen again. - How are you holding up? - Okay, I guess. - This is getting in the way of your work. Feel free to confide in me or Chaplain Finn. That's what we're here for. You know that Autumn refused spiritual care from us, right? - Yeah. - Okay, Marilyn told me she overheard you sharing your faith with Autumn, even after she told you she didn't want you to. - What? That's not true. - Normally this wouldn't be any of my business, but since you represent New Hope, this is a problem. - I can't believe she said that, she's lying. - Were you sharing your faith with Autumn? - Yeah, but... So what, you're gonna forbid me from talking to her? - I didn't say that, you just have to be careful what you say. - So I'm just supposed to just watch her die and keep my mouth shut? - My hands are tied, Jenny. We can't force our beliefs on anyone, especially as a company, you know that. - I wasn't forcing my beliefs on her, we are old friends. - This is not open for discussion. You're putting the company at risk. This is a liability, do you understand? If you care at all about the promotion, you'll follow orders, do you understand? - Yes. Can I talk to you outside? - Why, what's up? - Can we just go outside, please? - Whatever you have to say to me, you can say right here. - Fine, why did you tell Barbara I was sharing my faith with Autumn against her wishes? - Weren't you? - No, it wasn't like that and you know it. Are you sure this has nothing to do with the promotion? You're unbelievable, you've tried undermining me ever since you found out about that promotion. - That's not true, I'm just doing my job. - Is there a problem here, ladies? - Not here. - Jenny? - No. - You sure there's no problem? It was so loud I had to leave my office. - I don't know what that was about. You wanted that file on Autumn? - I did, thank you. (melancholy music) (door shuts) - Hey, honey. - Hey. (melancholy music) - Where you going? - I'm gonna go play basketball with Chris at the gym. - Oh, okay. - Going to Autumn's? - I don't know, why? - Just wondering. See you later. - Oh, hey, before I forget, we have that adoption meeting tomorrow. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - Have fun! (melancholy music) - Okay, so, before I go into the specific details of our program, I wanted to take just a minute to talk about adoption in general. Two of the biggest questions that I get are, how long is it going to take, and how much does it cost? And though I appreciate those questions, I really want to encourage you to think about adoption differently than anything that you've ever pursued before. You definitely need to think about it differently than purchasing a car or purchasing a home. And though those are important decisions, adoption is going to profoundly impact you and so many other people. It is the absolute furthest thing from a transaction. Adoption is so much more than that. So you and your spouse need to be on the same page before you even get started. And putting in the effort now will definitely pay off. It'll be worth the wait. - So, what'd you think? - Seems like a good company. - That's it? - What else do you want me to say, we're not ready. - I don't know. - This is why I didn't want to go. - Why? - Because now you're set on the idea no matter what. You heard what they said. There's a good chance we make too much money to qualify for any grants. How are we gonna pay for the home study? Don't get mad, you know it's the truth. - I'm not mad. - Look. If this is meant to be, then it'll happen. God will make a way. We just need to trust Him. (labored breathing) - How are you? - Jen (labored breathing). I'm scared. - About what? - I think about what it's gonna be like. - What do you think happens next? - All evidence points to decay (laughs and coughs). Aren't you gonna say anything? - Like what? - I don't know, something reassuring. - I can't. - What do you mean you can't? - Now you want my advice? - What? - Autumn, I'm risking my job to be here. Everything in my life is falling apart and I just want to help you. - Your life is falling apart? - I didn't mean that. - I didn't ask you to sit here and watch me die. You wanna talk about God? Tell me how this is part of His plan. Do you think I deserve this? Why are you here, Jenny? Are you here to save me? Or are you just here to save yourself from the guilt? (crying and labored breathing) You're just like every other Christian I know. You doubt God just as much as I do. You're just too afraid to admit it. (labored breathing) - Hey, take a deep breath. You're okay. Here, here, drink this. Take a sip. (labored breathing) Do you have any Ativan? I'm gonna go ask your mom, okay? (labored breathing) Water. - Are you okay, hon? - I gave Autumn half a milligram of Ativan. She can have one to two tablets every four hours as needed for her anxiety. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Are you sure? - I think Autumn is struggling, spiritually. I've seen spiritual distress before. It's different from physical pain. It usually manifests itself as anger and anxiety. - We've never been a spiritual family. - I know. - But ever since Autumn was diagnosed, things have changed for me. I do a lot of praying now, Jenny. - That's good. I'm telling you this because, because you and Mr. C should be prepared. Autumn may only have a week left. (melancholy music) I need you. Show me the way to help my friend. Are you even listening? - In Cash Fast, our pay day loan is quick and easy. ♫ I can't fight this alone ♫ You're there and always have been ♫ When I was at my low ♫ Your love came crashing in ♫ I'm broken down ♫ Worn out ♫ You made my life new ♫ So let me fall ♫ Into you, fall into you ♫ Let me fall ♫ Into you, fall into you ♫ Let me fall ♫ Into you ♫ Fall into you ♫ Let me fall ♫ Into you ♫ Fall into you ♫ I'm letting go, breaking free from all my pain ♫ I'm letting go, getting rid of all my shame ♫ I'm letting go into the one and only name - Hey, ma. - Hi. - I'm really sorry for the way that I acted. - So am I. - And I'm sorry for not returning your phone calls. - I know, you've been through a lot, come on in. Thirsty? - No, thanks. Look, I'm sorry about what I said about dad. - I know. - I feel like I gave up on him. - He gave up on us, a long time ago. And he's responsible for his choices and their consequences. But that's in the past. We need to focus on what's in front of us. We still have each other. I'm seeing a counselor now. - Good for you! Do you really think dad's in a better place, mom? - I think God could even forgive your father. - I think so, too. Maybe they had a long talk. - Maybe. - That's all, folks. - Thank you for stopping by. - Do you have a minute? - Yes, come on in. Marilyn told me Autumn's not doing very well. - No, she's not. - Jen, I think what you're doing for Autumn is great, but it puts the company at risk and-- - I know, that's why I wanted to talk with you. I thought about it and you're right. I'm sorry for the way that I acted. I'm too close to this case so, that's why I'm resigning. So I can be with my friend. - You're quitting?! - I'm letting go. - Are you sure you want to do this? - I feel more like I need to do this. I already lost so much time with Autumn, and there's only a little time left. Here's my letter of resignation. I talked it over with Todd and he supports my decision. If I truly believe what I say I do, then I need to live it. Autumn means more to me than my job. I need to be there for her. - Okay, I hate to see you go, but I respect your decision. Don't be a stranger. - Thank you so much. (light music) Hey, I wanted to let you know that I gave my notice so I could be with Autumn. I wish you the best of luck in the director's position. Really, I mean it. - Can I help you? - Yes, can we talk about my promotion? - Your promotion. - Well, now that Jenny has resigned, I'm the only choice. What's the raise like? Do I get more vacation time? - Well, you were interviewed and had a fair and objective evaluation. - And? - And your leadership skills weren't up to the standards required by the position. We've concluded we're not going to open the position at this time, I'm sorry. We can discuss your career development strategy at your next review. (knocking on door) - Hey Jenny, come on in. - Thanks. - Autumn's been sleeping all day, but she's up now. The care your company has provided has been wonderful. Marilyn has been great. I'm so thankful for the work you guys do. - Hey. - Hey. - Can I come in? I came here to apologize. I'm really sorry for the way I treated you. I can be too overbearing and controlling sometimes. - No, not you. - I'm being serious, you're ruining the moment. I quit today. - Quit what? - My job. - What? Why? - To be here with you. - Jenny! - You are so much more important to me than my job. I couldn't let that get in the way of our friendship. I'm here for you now, okay? - You didn't have to do that. - I wanted to. I will keep praying for you but, I didn't come here to preach, okay? - I love you. - I love you too. Todd and I are thinking about adopting. - Really? - Yeah. - That's amazing. - I want to, Todd's worried about the money. It's expensive. - Can you not have the kids the old fashioned way? I'm sorry, I didn't-- - No, don't be, it's okay. - I didn't know. - Yeah, I haven't told many people. - I think it's really wonderful that you're going to adopt. You're gonna be a great mom, Jenny. You deserve it. - We'll see, I want to. - You will. - Thanks. - I can't believe you're doing this for me. I, uh, I read a bit of the Bible you gave me. Just a little bit. - I really didn't come here to preach. I just wanted to be with you when we have the time. There is a passage I think you'd like. I can mark it in the Bible for you. It's about how we need not worry about our lives, because God takes care of us. You should read it, if you'd like. - Okay. - Now, what I really came here for. - The treasure map! - Yeah, next time I come I'll bearing pirate's booty. (crying) - So, tell me, what's so good about this God of yours? - Well, I can tell you where it started for me. - You're sure you don't want any help? - I'm fine, promised Autumn I would find it. Thanks for letting me do this. It really means a lot to me. - I know. (laughing) (bright music) (cell phone ringing) - Hello? Okay, yeah, I'll be right there. Thanks for the call, Mare. (weeping) (somber music) - What are you writing? - Autumn's eulogy, her mom asked me to speak at her wake. - I'm proud of you. - For what? - The way you've handled everything that you've been through. - Thanks. I guess I blew our chances at adopting, huh? - You did the right thing. - Hey, mom. - I'm sorry, Jen. - Thanks. - Hey. - Hey. - I've got something for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I'm gonna... - Of course. - You did a lousy job making that map you know? I destroyed half my mom's yard and still couldn't find these stones. It doesn't seem real. I can't believe you're gone. I'm so sorry I wasn't a better friend. - You were a better friend to her than you know. - Hey, Mrs. C. - Hi, honey. I want you to know you were wonderful. Autumn was so happy to have you by her side. - I wish I could have done more for her. - For what it's worth, I don't think you could have done anything more. I was going through Autumn's things last night and I found the Bible you gave her. - You can keep it. - You don't know how much your prayers and support have meant to me. It's hard to explain, but I felt a sense of peace in Autumn's passing. I know God was right there by my side. - You don't know how much I needed that. - Oh, honey. (weeping) - Hi everyone. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Jenny Pluth Paine, Autumn's friend. When Mrs. Cooper asked me to do Autumn's eulogy, I didn't hesitate to say yes, even though the idea of it terrified me. Autumn was my best friend growing up. We have some really great memories together. I would do anything for her. She was, is, very special to me. God has taught me a lot through this journey. I wasn't as strong in my faith as I thought I was. I learned that everyone has their own journey, and Autumn let me find my way and taught me how to love like a real friend. So, Autumn and I met at recess. We were play hopscotching and had to first draw the little squares. Autumn's were perfect, and mine were all squiggly. And we looked back at them and she, she said that's because her fine motor skills were exceptional, at seven years old. Well, Autumn, you truly were exceptional. (cell phone ringing) Hello? - Hi, is Jenny Paine available? - This is she. - Hi, this is Steven Marks with Trust Community Bank. I'm the Branch Manager here. - Hi. - I'm calling to notify you that you're the sole beneficiary of an account held by the late Allen Pluth. - Okay. - If you could come in at your earliest convenience, we'd like to go over the account with you and we have a few documents we'd like you to sign. - Oh, okay, sure. I can be there later today. - Thank you, and you have a great day. - Okay, I just need one more signature from you right here. And then this is the total amount that was left in your name. - Oh, wow, I'm shocked. I had no idea my dad had listed me as a beneficiary. - Well, you're all set. You'll see the transfer in your account within two to three business days. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Absolutely. - I feel like I should (laughing). Have a good rest of your day. - Thanks, you as well. - Didn't see that coming, huh? - It still doesn't seem real. - Yeah. You know, I bet your dad would want us to use this money to help start our family. What do you say? - I think we should pray first about what God wants us to do. - Sounds like a plan.
