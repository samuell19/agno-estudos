This is part of the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert, a benefit event in memory of music executive Ahmet Ertegun (1923-2006) at the O2 Arena in London on 10 December 2007. Ertegun, the founder of Atlantic Records, is considered one of the most significant figures in modern recording history. Released in 2012. This is Cult. Youth News editor, Scott Schuster. Good evening. It really was the biggest crowd ever assembled for a single performance in one place, in the entire history of the world. It was tonight and it was in Tampa. The name of the group... They've been around for years. Popular with the acid-rock crowd, big on album sales. Tonight they broke the world record set by The Beatles, and Channel 13's John Jones watched what happened. Led Zeppelin played in Atlanta on the first stop of a nationwide tour, selling out there 49,239. That even beat The Beatles record. When a rock group attains a stature such as Led Zeppelin, they travel with their own jet. Waiting at the airport, two limousines and a police escort. Just 40 minutes to showtime, Led Zeppelin arrives here at Tampa Air Center at the Tampa International Airport. I'm pleased to say that one of the group's four members has my same name, that's John Paul Jones and he's their bass player. Jimmy Page is the lead guitarist. Robert Plant, the lead singer, he's the one with long, curly hair. And John Bonham is the drummer. If you were at Tampa Stadium tonight or anywhere nereby, that's the sort of thing you saw and heard. "Good Times Bad Times" Led Zeppelin I (1969) Page/Plant/Bonham/Baldwin* * John Richard Baldwin is John Paul Jones' real name. In the days of my youth I was told what it means to be a man Now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam Good times, bad times, you know, I've had my share; when my woman left home with a brown-eyed man, well, I still don't seem to care Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end, but when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend Good times, bad times, you know, I've had my share; when my woman left home for a brown-eyed man, well, I still don't seem to care Good times, bad times, you know, I've had my share; when my woman left home for a brown-eyed man, well, I still don't seem to care I know what it feels to be alone, I sure do wish I was at home I don't care what the neighbors say, I'm gonna love you each and every day "Ramble On" Led Zeppelin II (1969) Page/Plant Leaves are falling all around, It's time I was on my way Thanks to you I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay But now it's time for me to go The autumn moon lights my way For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, it's headed my way Sometimes I get so tired, Just one thing I wanna do Ramble on, sing that song On my way I got no time for spreadin' roots, the time has come to be gone And though our health we drank a thousand times, it's time to ramble on Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air It was in the darkest depths of Mordor I met a girl so fair But Gollum and the Evil One crept up and slipped away with her It ain't nothing I can do now Sing my song On my way I gotta keep searchin' for my girl I gotta keep searchin' for my girl Recorded at Juggy Sound Studio in New York on their first US tour. Performed live in its entirety for the first time at this concert. Inspired by Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. "Black Dog" Led Zeppelin IV (1971) Plant/Jones/Page Hey, hey, mama said, the way you move gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove Child, she said, the way you swing gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting Baby, when you walk that way, watch your honey drip, I can't keep away I gotta roll, can't stand still I got a flamin' heart, can't get my fill Eyes that shine burnin' red Dreams of you all through my head Didn't take too long 'fore I found out what people mean by down and out Spent my money and took my car Started tellin' her friends she gonna be a star I don't know, but I been told, a big-legged woman ain't got no soul Now all I ask for and all I pray, a steady-loving mama gonna come my way Need a girl to hold my hand, will tell me no lies, make me a happy man Black Dog refers to a nameless strayed black retriever that ran around the Headley Grange (a mansion in Hampshire) during recording sessions. The retriever was old but still sexually active like the main character of the song who has a desperate love desire. For this song Jones wanted to use a winding riff and unusual rhythm changes that people could not dance to. Jones wrote the basic riff on the back of a train ticket on his way to a rehearsal at Page's Pangbourne boathouse in 1968. The drums and guitar actually play completely different patterns. A capella verses of this song were inspired by Fleetwood Mac's song Oh Well. Page performed Oh Well with The Black Crowes on their 1999 tour. Jones wanted to try Electric Blues on this song. He got the idea after hearing Muddy Waters' album Electric Mud (1968). As a result Black Dog was an example of blues rock on the album. Good evening! "In My Time of Dying" Physical Graffiti (1975) Page/Baldwin/Plant/Bonham In my time of dying don't want nobody to mourn All I want for you to do is take my body home Well, well, well, so I can die easy Jesus, gotta make up Jesus gotta make up Meet me, Jesus, meet me Why don't you meet me in the middle of the air If my wings should fail me, Lord, meet me with another pair Well, well, well, so I can die easy Jesus, gotta make up Gotta make up Saint Peter at the gates of Heaven, won't you let me in I never did no harm I never did no wrong Gabriel, let me blow your horn I must have did somebody some good Gabriel, let me blow your horn I never did no wrong I must have did somebody some good I never did no wrong And I see them in the streets And I see them in the field And I see them everywhere And I know it's got to be real I just wanna have some fun Jesus, gotta make up I see sinners creeping up here all marchin' Won't you make me my dyin' bed Thank you for thousands and thousands of emotions that we've been going through for the last six weeks together, and finally get to this point, for Ahmet, to bring Jason in and the double-bass drum pedal. This is one we've... This is a first adventure with this song in public "For Your Life" Presence (1976) Page/Plant You said I was the only, with my lemon in your hand Exhibition is your habit, emotion second-hand I had to pull away to save me Maybe next time around And she said, Don't you want it? Don't you want cocaine-cocaine? I hadn't planned to, I did not plan to try it, fry it I heard a cry for mercy in the city of the damned And in the pits you go no lower, the next stop's underground Hello underground Your wine and roses ain't quite over, till Fate deals a losing hand And she said, I did not mean to, did not plan to... You overran it, you overran it Do it Do it when you wanna When you blow it, baby, you got to blow it right When you fake it, mama, you better fake it right When you fake it, baby, fake it for your life Do it when you wanna I'd love to have you, baby, but I don't know what to do Sometime, baby, there's nothin' I could do On the balance of a crystal, I'm payin' through the nose And when they couldn't resist you, I thought you'd go with the flow And now your stage is empty, pull down the curtain, baby, please Roll up your show Don't you want cocaine-cocaine? I don't wanna fry in it For your life In 1935, Robert Johnson recorded a song called Terraplane Blues. It's appeared in a thousand different guises since. Maybe Johnson got it from somewhere else, I'm sure he did. Everybody nicks it. This is a kind of the Led Zeppelin Terraplane Blues, it's called "Trampled Under Foot" Physical Graffiti Page/Plant/Baldwin Greasy slicked-down body, groovy leather trim I like the way you hold the road, mama, it ain't no sin Love Trouble-free transmission helps your oil's flow Mama, let me pump your gas Mama, let me do it all Talkin' 'bout love Dig that heavy metal underneath your hood Baby, I could work all night, believe I've got the perfect tools A model built for comfort, really built with style Specialist tradition, mama, let me feast my eyes Factory air-conditioned, heat begins to rise Guaranteed to run for hours, mama, it's a perfect size Go-getter Groovin' on the freeway, gauge is on the red I gun down on my gasoline, I believe I'm gonna crack a head I can't stop talkin' about love Come to me for service every hundred miles Baby, let me check your points, fix your overdrive Fully automatic, heat begins to rise Makes me wonder what I did, before we synchronized Feather-light suspension, KONIs* couldn't hold * A prime brand of shock absorbers. I'm so glad I took a look inside your showroom doors Note the mention of heavy metal, and this in 1936, if those are the original lyrics. Steppenwolf are credited as allegedly the first to use the term in rock music in Born to Be Wild in 1967, described sometimes as the first heavy metal song. Terraplane Blues, Robert Johnson*, 1936. * A US blues guitarist, singer/songwriter (1911-1938). This next song, it's been immortalized by The Staple Singers*, * A US gospel, soul, and R&B singing family band in '48-75. more recently by The Blind Boys from Alabama. I think we must have heard this from... We were in a church somewhere in Mississippi. Written in about 1932* * In Wikipedia, released in 1927-1928. when Blind Willie Johnson was just... just before he had his first shot. "Nobody's Fault But Mine" Presence Page/Plant It's nobody's fault but mine Trying to edge my soul to light Brother he showed me the gong My brother he showed me the ding-dong ding-dong How to kick that gong to light Got a monkey on my back I got the monkey on my back I need to kick that gong to light Sister she taught me to roll My sister she taught me to roll How to roll that log to light How to kick that log to light "No Quarter" Houses of the Holy (1973) Page/Plant/Baldwin Close the door, put out the light You know they won't be home tonight The snow falls hard and don't you know, the winds of Thor are blowing cold They're wearing steel that's bright and true to build a dream for me and you They choose the path where no-one goes They ask no quarter He gives no quarter No quarter Walking side by side with death, the devil mocks their every step The snow drives back the foot that's slow The dogs of doom are howling more They carry steel that's bright and true to build a dream for me and you They choose the path where no-one goes They ask no quarter They give no quarter The dogs of doom are howling more! The piano, John Paul Jones. "Since I've Been Loving You" Led Zeppelin III (1970) Plant/Jones/Page I've been working from seven, baby, mama, to eleven every night It really makes the life a drag I don't think that's right I've really been the best, the best of fools You know I did what I could, yes, you know I did Yes, I love you, baby I'm about to lose Everybody tryna tell me, baby, that you didn't mean me no good I've been trying I really try to do the best I could My tears they fell like rain Watch them Watch out! Don't you see them falling? Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door? You had the nerve to tell me you didn't want me no more I open my front door, I hear my back door slam I think you got one of them new fangled back-door men I've been working to eleven, to eleven from seven, baby You hear me talking to ya It's quite... It's quite peculiar to imagine, I don't know how many songs we recorded together, but to think about creating a dynamic evening, choosing something from ten different albums, there are certain songs that have to be there. And this is one of them. "Dazed and Confused" Led Zeppelin I Page/Jake Holmes Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true I wanted a woman, I never bargained for you Lots of people talk, few of them know the soul of a woman was created below You hurt and abuse tellin' all of your lies Run 'round, sweet baby How you hypnotize I don't know where you're goin', I only know just where you've been Sweet little baby, I want you again Every day I work so hard bringin' home my hard-earned pay I try to love you, baby, but you push me away Sweet little baby, let them say what they will Will your tongue wag so much when I send you the bill? I've been dazed and confused for so long it's not true I wanted a woman, never bargained for you Lots of people talk about it but few of them know the soul... Guitar, Jimmy Page. "Stairway to Heaven" Led Zeppelin IV Page/Plant There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold and she's buying a stairway to heaven When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed, with a word she can get what she came for And she's buying a stairway to heaven There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure 'cause you know sometimes words have two meanings In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings: sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven Don't you know now And it makes me wonder There's a feeling I get when I look to the west and my spirit is crying for leaving In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees and the voices of those who stand looking And it makes me wonder And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune, then the piper will lead us to reason And a new day will dawn for those who stand long, and the forests will echo with laughter It makes me wonder If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now It's a spring clean for the May queen Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run there's still time to change the road you're on It really makes me wonder Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know, the piper's calling you to join him Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know a stairway lies on the whispering wind? And as we wind on down the road our shadow's taller than our soul There walks a lady we all know who shines white light and wants to show how everything still turns to gold And if you listen very hard the tune will come to you at last When all are one and one is all to be a rock and not to roll And she's buying Often rated among the greatest rock songs of all time, it wasn't a chart hit because it was never released as a single. Plant explained the lyrics as a cynical aside about a woman getting everything she wanted all the time without giving back any thought or consideration. Page says that it crystallized the essence of the band. It had everything there and showed the band at its best as a unit. Not just solos or other things. It was a milestone. Every musician wants to do something of lasting quality, something which will hold up for a long time and they did it with this song." In 1982 the band was accused of a Satanic message allegedly heard when playing backwards the part about "a bustle in your hedgerow". Plant rejected this as a bizarre coincidence, saying that you need a lot of time to even consider that people would do that. Hey Ahmet, we did it! "The Song Remains the Same" Houses of the Holy Page/Plant I had a dream, crazy dream Anything I wanted to know, any place I needed to go Hear my song So people, won't you listen now Sing along You don't know what you're missing now Any little song that you know Everything that's small has to grow And it always grows California sunlight, sweet Calcutta rain Honolulu Starbright - the song remains the same Sing out Hare Hare, dance the Hoochie Koo City lights, oh so bright, as we go sliding... Jason Bonham, drums. Spectacular. Now, Jason has... I remember... I can't really remember how long ago it was but Jason was like this big. His mom, his dad used to sing. There were the best Jimi Hendrix impersonators in the whole of Worcestershire. Pat's got a great voice. I remember John used to be in a band in Birmingham and used to sing The Wind Cries Mary about 400 times a night. That was what how it was. And Jason's a pretty cool singer too. So let us feature Jason on vocals here now. "Misty Mountain Hop" Led Zeppelin IV Page/Plant/Baldwin Walkin' in the park just another day, baby, what do I saw? Crowds of people sittin' on the grass with flowers in their hair said, Hey, boy, do you wanna score? And you know how it is I really don't know what time it was, so I asked them if I could stay awhile I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really, I was really out of my mind Just then a policeman got up to me and then he said, Please, hey, would we care to all get in line They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun He said that his friends would all drop by Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see And, baby, do you like it? There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rustin', not trying to fight it You really don't care if they're coming or not I know that it's all a state of mind If you go down in the streets today, baby, you better, you better open your eyes Folk down there really don't care, don't care, really don't, which, which way the pressure lies So what is it I'm gonna do? I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains where the spirits go now Over hills where the spirits fly Here they come, watch out I really don't know "Kashmir" Physical Graffiti Page/Plant/Bonham Let the sun beat down upon my face with stars to fill my dream I am a traveler of both time and space to be where I have been Sit with elders of a gentle race the world has seldom seen I talk of days for which they sit and wait and all will be revealed We talk of songs from tongues of lilting grace The sounds caress my ear But not a word I heard could I relate The story was quite clear Baby, I've been crying There's no defyin' All I see turns to brown as the sun burns the ground And my eyes fill with sand as I scan this wasted land I'm trying to find, trying to find where I've been Pilot of the storm who leaves no trace like thoughts inside a dream Who heeds the path that led me to this place, yellow desert stream My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again sure as the dust that floats high in June movin' through Kashmir Father of the four winds, fill my sails across the sea of years with no provision but an open face along the straits of fear My baby, when I'm on my way, when I see, baby, when I see the way, you stay When I've been down Yes, baby, yes, my baby, let me take you there Inspired by a drive through the Sahara Desert in Morocco when the band was heading to the National Festival of folklore in 1973. Plant, who wrote most of the lyrics, explained that the inspiration came from the road never seeming to end. The unique guitar riff is one of the most memorable in rock history, developed by Page over two years. The composition was inspired by Middle-Eastern, Moroccan, and Indian music. At the time this song was composed, none of the band members had ever been to Kashmir. Plant once named it as one of his favourite tracks for possessing all the latent energy and power that wasn't heavy metal. It was something else, the pride of Led Zeppelin. Page and Plant recorded a live 12-minute version of the song with a Moroccan/Egyptian orchestra for their album No Quarter in 1994. What do you think, Dave? "Whole Lotta Love" Led Zeppelin II Page/Plant/Bonham/Baldwin/Dixon You need coolin' Baby, I ain't not foolin' Send you down back to schoolin' Way down inside, mama, you need it Baby, you need it I'm gonna give you my love Want a whole lotta love You've been yearnin', baby, I've been learnin' All them good times, baby, I've been mistreatin' Way down inside you need love Mama, you need love Baby, you need love Is that it? Is that it? You need coolin', baby, I ain't foolin' Send you back to schoolin' Way down inside, mama, you need love Baby, you need love Way down inside, woman, you need love Shake for me, girl, I wanna be your backdoor man Keep coolin' it, baby I feel so good The opening track on the album. When released as a single in the US, it became their first hit single and was eventually certified Gold. The lyrics were borrowed by Plant from the song You Need Loving by Small Faces, in turn, a cover of Muddy Waters' You Need Love. The lyrics were originally written by Willie Dixon. The Small Faces were never sued by Dixon but Led Zeppelin were in 1985. Plant confessed the fact and said that you only get caught when successful, that's the game. The distinct drum sound was recorded in the big room at Olympic Studios in London with 28-foot ceilings. The drum kit was on a platform and microphones were put and hung in different places at different heights. The freeform section in the middle of the song was produced by Page and engineer Eddie Kramer by "twiddling every knob known to man" on a console. There is a shorter version lasting 3:10 (5:33 on the album) released by Atlantic for the promotion on radio stations. It doesn't have the freeform section in the middle and fades out earlier. It wasn't intended for commercial release but some copies were sold in the US, a collector's item now. Thanks a lot, everybody! Thank you for coming along. And thank you to everybody who made this show possible, A couple of our friends who came along to play on this show tonight for the memory of Ahmet Ertegun in the days when Atlantic Records was the most magnificent record company on the planet. Good night. Hey, thanks so much! It's really been an amazing night for all of us. Thank you very much! "Rock and Roll" Led Zeppelin IV Page/Plant/Bonham/Baldwin It's been a long time since I rock-and-rolled It's been a long time since I did the Stroll Let me get it back, baby, where I come from It's been a long time, been a long time, lonely, lonely time It's been quite a while since The Book of Love* * A popular song by The Monotones. I can't count the tears of a life with no love Open your arms Baby, let my love come running in It's been a long time, been a long time It's been quite a while since we walked in the moonlight Making vows that just can't work right Carry me back, baby, where I come from Page said that the basis of the song was created during a jam session, whilst the band were trying to finish the track Four Sticks. After one of the failed takes, Bonham began to play the drum sequence based on Little Richard's song Keep A-knockin'. Page added a guitar riff, the most part of which is heard on the song. Plant wrote the lyrics in response to critics claiming Led Zeppelin III not being really rock 'n' roll.
