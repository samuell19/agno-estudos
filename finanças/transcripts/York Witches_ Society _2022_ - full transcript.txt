[introduction music] [eerie music] - [birds chirping] - [church bell chiming] [Heather screaming] [grunting and groaning] [Priest] The people have spoken. Let me go! You've consorted with demons. And borne their offspring! I am compelled to deliver your judgment, Heather Gray. Shame on you! [bell chiming] [crow squawking] One last chance, Heather Gray. Confess, admit your sin. You are the last witch in England. You have consorted with the devil. And then I will ease your pain, and slit your throat before you burn. [spits] You have a daughter. Think of her. I will find her, and I will slaughter her. Won't you please our young King James? Admit what you are. You have consorted with a demon. It is time. The men I told you about, they're coming. Tell me where the child is, and I will be lenient. The bad men? Yes, the bad men. Never! [chain clanks] Do not say I was unjust. [Heather grunting] No! [fire cracking] [Matthias] I'll find your spawn, Gray, if it's the last thing I do. I will follow you through Hell. I will wipe your filthy bloodline from this earth. I curse you. Matthias Alistair. So long as a Gray walks this land. Take this. The Goddess will keep you safe. .Your soul is cursed and forever damned. I curse you! I damn you to the hell that is neither death nor life! [groans] I curse you! [screaming] [incidental music] [birds chirping] [sentimental music] [indistinct distant chattering] [bell chiming] [ominous music] [gravel crunching] [Amber] A's across the board, Chris. I swear it. You don't need to convince me. Grades is the least of my concerns. Ah, yes. Here we go. The old "Don't forget to socialize." Making friends is an important part of life, Amber. It hasn't been easy for you, all this moving around. Now's your chance to form some real bonds if you can just. I won't be here forever. - [bell chiming] I should go. Wisdom comes in many forms. Not just through study. You know. I have to go. I have something for you. It's here somewhere. [birds chirping] Chris, it's. It's been a tradition between mothers and daughters in your family for generations. Your mother would have wanted you to have it today. Thank you. I'll make you proud. You already have. Goodbye, Amber. [footsteps receding] [button clicks] [car trunk closes] [door opens] - Hello. - [Kirsten] Hi! I'm Kirsten. Your roommate. Hi. Oh, okay. I'm Amber. I thought that I... You thought you had your own room. But this is cool, yeah? Sharing? Yeah. All the rooms here are shared. [door closes] [gasps] Wow. I love your pendant. [objects clanking] I didn't think anyone was gonna come. I mean, you have missed all of Freshers week. [chuckles softly] Um, so have you joined any clubs yet? I just got here. Witches? Yeah, it's my thing. Look, I have managed to distill the perfect blend of social groups in order to support my personal, creative, and social growth here. That's crap. You don't need that. Yes. Yes, I do, Ambs. I'm the first person in my family to go to uni. That means I intend to network the shit out of this place. I think I just about have the balance right too. Well, that's great. All but one. The York Witches Society. [eerie music] [Amber] The York what? The preeminent social group. They're playacting the witch's thing for sure, but it is symbolic. I mean, strong women and all that. The elite. They have influences in all the key positions around the university. They are the who's who of who. Entirely too exclusive for the likes of me. Sounds more like the York Bitches Society if you ask me. But you do what you like. I'm here to study. [♪♪♪] ♪ Her eyes seem to twinkle With her smile ♪ ♪ She flips ♪ - Heya. Do you wanna hang out? - No. ♪ Her golden hair as you walk by ♪ - I mean, I'm working, so. - ♪ She's trying ♪ Great. ♪ Desperately To be the girl you need ♪ ♪ As sweet as candy. ♪ ♪ Like candy. ♪ - [door squeaks] You're welcome. Gotta go. Film club. Wanna come? Okay, bye. [door closes] [Amber] I'm really considering dropping Dr. Cooper's class. If it wasn't mandatory, I'd have done it by now. But we're just getting to the exciting stuff. The Reformation. She is coasting, though. Coasting? Understatement. She's phoning it in. Been trotting out the same lectures for the past 20 years. - [eerie music] - [Kirsten gasps softly] What is it? It's them. The York Witches Society. [receding footsteps] [eerie music] Well, that's the saddest thing I've ever seen. Come on, let's get some lunch. I stand corrected. [eerie music] [camera clicks] [Dr. Cooper] The Malleus Maleficar, m or The Hammer of the Witch. A guide to finding, torturing and exterminating witches. Followed closely by King James's own book, Demonologie, which expanded on how witches consorted with Satan and kick started the witch trials. Thanks to the printing press, it went viral. [student chuckle] Single mothers, old women with dementia, disabled children. Oh, yes, [sighs] there were methods of torture and killing children and women that have yet to be equaled. Burnings, savage beatings.. [projector clicks] This brings being stoned to a whole new level. - [student chuckle] - [projector clicks] [eerie music] Is that all you have to offer? Well, I think we're just about out of time here. I said. - [projector clicks] - .is that all you have to offer? Some snide remarks? This violence against... against the innocent, against women, against anybody who is different. [Dr. Cooper] Was different. Amber. Is that Amber? This is history. I suggest you read a few papers, and, uh, we can discuss at your next seminar. Now. - [Amber] I've read your papers, Dr. Cooper. Your abysmally small body of original work. I see from the date of your last thesis that your academic achievements are few and far between. In fact, it's been years since something relevant to contemporary academia or social change has come from your fingertips. You, Doctor. you dispense the gruesome details of the past like it's a shopping list, reeling off the blood and guts of the darkest time in our history, and all you have to bring is some tired jokes! By the end of this, we will have learnt one thing: What true, dead social theories and jaded academics look like. [projector clatters] [door closes] [students applauding] [bell ringing] [birds chirping] [footsteps approaching] Amber, are you okay? [Kate] Hey! Amber! Slow down. Quite a show. I liked it. What'd you think? - Yeah. Yeah, good show. Creepy Cooper. Pretty disrespectful. Excuse me? Ignore Jessica. She's got no filter. Anyway, wanted to catch your ear for a moment, Amber. We think you'd make a great member of the York Witches Society. [chuckles] No, thanks. We'll definitely think about it. Kate definitely just meant Amber. Even if I did want to join your little teatime coven, which I don't, it'd be both of us or nothing. Think about it. - Amber Gray? - Yeah? Please come with me. The dean would like to speak with you. Text A land a, make sure she's in that meeting. [footsteps receding] [Dean Rathbone] At which point, Dr. Cooper tells me that she extricated herself from the classroom for her own safety. I was just making a point. Please, Miss Gray. I understand you are upset, but we cannot allow our students here at Lilith to feel it is appropriate to threaten a professor. I'm not upset. Dean Rathbone. I did not threaten her. I merely mentioned... I really have limited options here, Amber. Some of the faculty board have already mentioned suspension. A few of our hottest heads have called to talk about expulsion. Bloody hell, that was quick. Please, Dean, you must understand. I was only... - [knocks on door] [door opens, creaks] - [A land a] Dean? - A land a. Just heard what happened. Hey, Amber. I've just been pointing out to Miss Gray that this behavior will not do. Hmm. As president of the Student Union, do you have any comment? Well, Miss Gray is new to the college, Dean, so I think some leniency should be shown. I propose that I take Miss Gray under my wing. Introduce her to the York Witches Society. We can show her the ropes and what's acceptable here at Lilith. You've got to be kidding me. Be quiet, please. If Miss Gray agrees to help with our preparation for the upcoming Sam ha in celebration, I think you could consider her redeemed. Oh, we have a meeting tonight. W-we can bring her into the fold. It's settled. Thank you, A land a. Okay, leave. What? I don't get a say in this? The Burning Belle, tonight, 7:30. Don't be late. [paper crackles] I am an alumna of the YWS myself, Miss Gray. It is exactly the right thing for you. You have potential, Miss Gray. Don't throw it away. - [footsteps receding] - [bell ringing] [door opens] Shit, then. How'd you guys get in here? [Emily] How'd you get to have your own room? Well? [door closes] Well, I said we'll look after her. Show her the ropes and all that. And Boney agreed. You don't mean join us. Why not? [Jessica] Because we don't know anything about her. She could be anybody. Oh, come on. She is cut out for greatness. Isn't that what we want? - Yes. - I like her. But not at any price. She's a loner. I'm with Jessica. We were blown away by whatever she did in there with Cooper. [Kate] Charlotte's right. I think she'd be perfect for us. Let's test her. See if she really has what it takes. Hmm, but not her runt of a friend. [A land a] Okay, so let's vote on it. [Flora] But what about Kirsten? Kate, we're supposed to always be seven. Kirsten won't pass the test. [Flora laughs] All in favor? [A land a] Good. Because I already told them where the gathering is. Now, you lot gots to bounce. [door opens] [crickets chirping] [bike creaking] [owl hooting] [bell jangles] Yep, this is it. The Burning Belle. This just gets better. [exhales] [knocks on door] [door opens, creaks] After you. [door closes] - [footsteps approaching] - [floor creaking] [bottles clank] Bloody hell. Sorry. [footsteps approaching] They're about to begin. [bottles clinking] That's Jess's brother, Rob. Oh, we'd almost given up on you. Just stay there. - Sorry we're late. - Be quiet. Wait there. Don't speak. [footsteps approaching] As the empires of men rise and fall, we, the York Witches Society, have been tasked with the preservation of knowledge and power breathed into the earth by the Goddess. As surely as the sun brings the dawn and the moon keeps vigil in the night sky, the YWS will bring order and goodness to York, to Britain, to the world. [footsteps approaching] [floor creaking] Balance through judgment. Excellence through commitment. Peace through fairness. Love through sisterhood. Amber Gray, Kirsten Childerson, we have deemed you women of stature and social merit. From this moment, worlds of opportunity lay before you. Doors of prosperity may open in your path. Unending influence can be yours, should you but choose to take up your mantle as a member of the York Witches Society. Are you prepared to undergo the three trials? Witches, are you prepared to... - I am. - I said don't speak. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. For heaven's sake, Jess, get the lights. [Flora] You might think this is a joke. But if you don't at least respect the tradition held by this group for the last 400 years, we'll make sure the dean hears about it. [Kate] Easy, Flora. [Jessica] Amber, I know it's your first year here and you think you're all that, but I really wouldn't take this opportunity to join us for granted. Isn't that right, Kirsten? I mean, I'm sure Amber's just adjusting. No, I really think it's all horseshit. [Charlotte] The thing is, Amber, we take this very seriously, okay? So, all you have to do is go along with it for a couple of nights, and then you and your shadow here are off the hook. Okay? Plus, I went out on a limb for you. Boney will kick you out, you know. Yeah. Okay. Fine. [Kate] Lovely. Well then, you won't mind if we carry on the traditional initiation necessities tomorrow night then, will you? I suppose not. Tomorrow night. Eleven forty-five p.m., the college grounds. [footsteps receding] Shall we get back to college, actually? I think the union bar closes at eleven. [eerie music] [footsteps approaching] [Kate] One of the first tasks for every new witch to accomplish is one of courage. The mallet. As per tradition, the new witch will strike the old college bell and shout their name. All without getting caught. [receding footsteps] You ready? [footsteps receding] [footsteps approaching] [bell chiming] Kirsten Childerson! Kirsten Childerson! [footsteps approaching] [footsteps receding] - [bell rings] - Amber Gray... ow! [crow squawking] [ground rumbles] [wind blowing] [whispers] Hey! [mutters] Get down! [shouts] Louder, bitch! - [bell rings] - Amber Gray! - [ground rumbles] - [wind blowing] [tombstone cracks] Come on, Amber! Put some gusto into it! We can hardly hear you! - [bell ringing] - Amber Gray! You dumb witches! - [ground rumbles] - [wind blowing] - [tombstone cracks] - [girls laughing] [Porter] Hey. Who's there?! This is private property! [running footsteps] [♪♪♪] [wind blows] [eerie music] [girls giggling] [girls cheering] [A land a] Come on, Flora! [Flora] [panting] I'll catch you up. [A land a] The Burning Belle! Tomorrow night at 7:30! Don't be late! [Flora panting] [light clicking] [panting] [light clicking] Oh, perfect. [panting] [lamp buzzes] [eerie music] [panting] Hello? Jessica? Charlotte? [wind whooshes] [panting] Oh, god. Okay. [panting] [wind whooshes] [panting] [loud thud] Who's there? Who's there? [loud thud] Who's there? Help! [panting] Stop! [loud thud] [sobbing] [loud thud] [panting] [Demon growls] [Flora sobbing] [panting] [loud thud] [grunts] [panting] Anyone? I'm calling the police! [panting] [Demon growls] [Flora sobbing] [panting] [wind whooshes] [cycle bell rings] This used to be the gallows, literally, until our great-great-great grandfather took over as the local constable. He didn't like seeing dead thieves or witches hanging or burning for all to see. Nobody comes here now. Jess? No, thanks. Not for me either, thanks. I don't do business with new folks until I've had at least one drink with them. I'll come back to town with you. I need to pick up a few things for tonight. And I'll find out why Flora hasn't turned up yet. Okay, y'all. Ooh. Don't mind if I do. If you fancy a fire, there's plenty of wood outside, and there's an axe here somewhere. [lamp buzzing] What's with the lights? [Rob] We're off the grid out here. There's a genny round the back. Come on, Jess. It's now or never. I'll be back. An hour tops. [Emily] Okay. Are we doing this or what? Let's get this over with. Come on. It's gonna be great. [lamp buzzing] [footsteps approaching] [car engine starts] Okay. I'll make the first one. And then you make the rest of them. Okay. [straw crackling] Seven. Seven. That's it? That's the trial? You dragged me away from study for this? [Emily] This is the rest of the trial. Your task is knowledge. You must learn all key facts and spells before midnight. Why midnight? Well, that's when we come back to test you. And if you pass, you're in. You make the dolls, and you learn the craft. It's important for tonight. Yay. What's tonight? The Sam ha in. Impressive. Halloween? This is all some Halloween party game? Come on, Kirsten. We're out of here. This is kids' stuff. Feast of the Dead, Sam ha in, All Saints and All Souls. This is a special night. I'm staying. Great. I'll leave you to it then. [footsteps receding] [straw crackling] This place gives me the creeps. [water dripping] What's that noise? Oh, great. An indoor pool. [eerie music] [door opens] [crickets chirping] [eerie music] Where are you, Flora? [eerie music] [door closes] [eerie music] [doll splashes] [Kirsten] Let's see. [doll splashes] Oy, I've just made those. Get them out. I'm not doing them again. All right. [exhales] Then you can turn me into a toad. [eerie music] [Kirsten] "Light the sage..." Amber? Amber? Ambs? - Yeah? Uh, I'm listening. What? "Light the sage and guide it right; by door..." [both]... "and window cleanse the light." Wait, that's not a spell. It's a nursery rhyme. What nursery rhyme? Okay, let's try this one. "I call to the Goddess with sandalwood and brightest ribbon, "waxing fast and holding strong, "gently soothe this fevered brow whereupon my..." - "Whereupon my energy is safest now." Yeah, these aren't spells. They're nursery rhymes. Amber, how on earth do you know this stuff? Show me the book. Okay, let's try this one. "I invoke the Goddess"... invoke! "I invoke the Goddess to touch this charm "where from my mother it was born, and Goddess be my light..." - "Goddess be my light. "Help to keep me safe as the shadows fall upon me this night. "I invoke the Goddess to touch this charm "where from my mothers it was born, "and Goddess be my light. He-[ground rumbling] as shadow-[wind blowing]s night." [water dripping] [books slams] [Charlotte] What's going on down there? Are you two okay? Yeah, yeah, we're okay. Um, we're freezing. Ca... ca... can you put the heating on, or get us a sweater or something? [Charlotte] Hang on. I think I've got something in the car. [footsteps receding] [door closes] You want to talk about it? No. - [eerie music] - [crickets chirping] [owl hooting] [car door closes] [car door opens] [objects clanking] [gasps] - Hey, it's only me. God, what are you doing creeping up on me like that? [chuckling] I wasn't creeping. I can only go so fast with this pile. Here, take the axe. [panting] [♪♪♪] [wine flowing] [♪♪♪] You say nothing, understand? I won't. But come on, you know something happened. You must have some kind of power. You're a witch. What? I knew the moment I saw you. That pendant. That is the most ridiculous thing you ever said. And you said a lot of ridiculous things. But we have to find out. We have to do something. See what powers you have. - Stop! You are letting this stuff get to your head. [♪♪♪] "What is wanted is not the will to believe but..." If you don't stop this right now... "But the will to find out." Don't you want to know? Shut up, okay? If you breathe a word of this. I'm not a witch. What happened was some kind of, you know, collective hysteria. Like moving statues or apparitions. This is fantastic, Ambs. [Amber exhales] Don't touch me! I've told you before, okay? I don't need you. I don't need friends. I don't need anybody. What about Flora? I couldn't find her. We'll have to start without her. [footsteps approaching] Let's begin. [Amber] I'm going through with this farce ceremony to get the bloody thing out of the way. I just want to get back to my studies and on with my life. And you're only here because of me, remember? [straws crackling] [huffs] [eerie music] [straws crackling] [eerie music] Welcome all. Kirsten Childerson. Step forward, please. Amber Gray, step forward, please. As the empires of men rise and fall, we, the York Witches Society, have been tasked with the preservation of knowledge and power, breathed into the earth by the Goddess. As surely as the sun brings the dawn and the moon keeps vigil in the night sky, the York Witches Society will bring order and goodness to York, to the world. Balance through judgment. Excellence through commitment. Peace through fairness. Love through sisterhood. Amber Gray, Kirsten Childerson, we have deemed you women of stature and social merit. At this moment, worlds of opportunity lay before you, doors of prosperity will open in your path, unending influence will be yours, should you join us as witches. Are you prepared to be tested? [both] I am. Kirsten. A spell for healing? I invoke the Goddess. I invoke the Goddess to take my pain. To take their pain. Take the... the... the pain. Take the pain, to renew, refresh, and strength regain, by wind and fire. Come on, you got this. I invoke the Goddess to take the pain, to renew, refresh, and strength regain. By wind and fire, through blood and bone, release, restore, renew again. Amber. a spell for love. No. Something else. A spell for this special night. All Souls. A cleansing spell to release all souls from Purgatory. Adijure te Spiritus Neguissime by the mighty Goddess. Adijure te Spiritus Neguissime by the mighty Goddess. Adijure te Spiritus Neguissime by the mighty Goddess. I compel evil this night, show yourself, come into the light. Exorciamus Te Omnis immundis spirit us. That we may cleanse the world. That you may leave only good in your wake. - [thunder rumbles] - The earth listens to me. The earth quakes at my word. The mighty Goddess is within me and I compel evil this night and forever to show your face so that you may be shamed. The Goddess has spoken. [wind blowing] [exhales] What was that? [Demon growls] [Kirsten] This place is so drafty. The wind just picks up. It's a vortex. Honestly, Jessica, if you're bringing people out here, you should really get this place fixed up. Are we done here? [Demon growls] She said all souls, not demons! [Charlotte] I mean, I don't know about you lot, but I'm bloody starving. Let's eat. Let's have some fun. [Demon growls] [wind whooshes] [girls laughing] The only Latin I remember is vacca stulta. [girls laugh] [Kirsten] I don't get it. No. Of course. Amber, where did you go to school? I moved. A lot. I can say "goodbye" in 20 languages. Okay, my turn. What is it exactly that you do here? The witches, I mean. What's the witch thing about? - [girls laugh] - Okay. So, we don't have any powers in any magical sense, it's true. But we do have a sisterhood. We have rituals. We have rules. We support each other. One day when Emily's heading up some major corporation or. [girls laugh] Alanda's running for Parliament... [girls laugh] Or Charlotte does. Whatever Charlotte does. [girls laugh] .This bond we have will be the support we need. But there's only a handful of you. Of us. Amber, you are one of us. And then, there's the alumni. Plus, how cool are the dresses? - Amen to that. - [Amber chuckles] Kirsten, you know you're not in, right? What about peace through whatever and all that love through sisterhood stuff? Kirsten, I'm curious. How come you know so much about witchcraft but you couldn't manage to learn a simple four-liner? [girls laugh] [laughing] Oh my God. [girls laugh] ♪ Played me like a game ♪ ♪ It made me go insane ♪ ♪ You took my heart and smiled ♪ ♪ You kept it for a while ♪ ♪ Making me believe ♪ ♪ I was all that You needed you ♪ ♪ Oh baby ♪ ♪ Why you gotta go ♪ ♪ And leave my heart and soul ♪ ♪ I'm standing in the back With so matter of fact ♪ ♪ You had me at hello ♪ ♪ It seems so long ago ♪ ♪ Played me like a game And made me go insane ♪ I do like that pendant. Sorry. It's just I've seen it before, you know? What do you mean? I've seen it before. - Where? - In one of my books. You're mistaken. It was my mother's. I may be a bit dim in Latin, but I know my witchcraft. - [Jessica laughs] - [Amber] Give it a rest, Kirs. To the best YWS initiation ever! [girls] Hear, hear! I need some fresh air. Yeah, me too. [door opens] [door closes] [Charlotte] I can hardly see a thing. [Amber] Yeah. What's with this place? Come on. I need to go to the car. I've got some cigs in there. They'll kill me, but hey. I am what I am. Keep close. We don't want to get lost. Where did you park? I can't see the car anywhere. [car buzzes] Got 'em. [car door closes] Amber? [wind whooshes] What was that? I didn't see anything. Are you okay? We should get back to the pub. [Charlotte] Did you see something? No. Yes. I don't know. I don't want to stay out here. [footsteps receding] [pop music plays] They've forgotten how to use a car. I'll be downstairs in the basement packing up. Do you need me for anything? [A land a] Uh-uh, we're good. [wind whooshes] I think we're going the wrong way. [Charlotte] Why? Well, it didn't take us this long to get to the car. So it shouldn't take us this long to get back. - [car thumps] - Ow! Is this a joke? I've just gone round in a circle. How did we get back here? [voice screaming] Did you hear that? What? [Amber] You really don't hear anything? [Charlotte] Hear what? Are you okay? [voice screaming] [Amber] It's all around us. [voice screaming] Hit the lights. [car clicks] There! You see? There's nothing there. Do it again. I saw it. [car clicks] All I see is a blinding white light every time that the car lights come on. [trembling] No. A silhouette. A man, I think. He came by here earlier. And I can... I can hear him too. Hit the lights again. Charlotte. Charlotte? Charlotte?! [shouts] Charlotte! Charlotte! Charlotte! Charlotte! Where are you?! [distant shout] Charlotte! [eerie music fades] Amber? [eerie music] Amber? [Amber sobbing] [bell ringing] [Amber breathing heavily] [wind flashing] [wind whooshing] [voices muttering] [gasps] Oh! - [Demon growling] - [gasps] Oh! [Demon's eerie whispering] [Matthias] Gray! [ominous music] [Matthias snarling] [Charlotte grunts] [choking] [screams] [gasping and choking] [Matthias snarling] [Charlotte screams] [Matthias snarling] [Charlotte screams] Charlotte! [door opens, closes] [trembling] Something happened. Something happened to Charlotte. Something... somebody took her. What do you mean, somebody took her? I don't know. Something... it-it... It grabbed her and she... she. What? She what? Something took her. I'll go and get her. No, no, you can't. You can't go out there. You can't. - You stay away from that door. We have to find her. Because what if... We're not leaving our friend out there. Move out the way! [door opens] [footsteps receding] [Kirsten] Jesus, Amber! Come and help! [girls] [shouting] Charlotte! [lamp zaps] Oh, crap. [girls] [shouting] Charlotte! - [flashlight clicks] - [girls] [shouting] Charlotte! I'll get the lights back on and come and help. [girls] [shouting] Charlotte! - [owls hooting] - [A land a] Charlotte! Charlotte? Charlotte? [Jessica] Charlotte! [owl hooting] [ambient sounds of the night] [wind whooshing] [approaching footsteps] [whooshing] Oh, it's off. What did Jess say? First, check that it is off. Right. [eerie music] [Jessica] Charlotte? [faint echoing] Charlotte? [ominous music] [Emily] Charlotte! Charlotte? [eerie music] We should have stayed in the pub. What is wrong with you? Our friend is missing. Quiet. Where's Em? [Jessica] Em? Emily?! Next. Check there's enough fuel. Check. [wind whooshes] Charlotte? Is that you? [whooshing] And turn it to 220 volts. [dial clicking] - [leaves crackling] - [gasps] [crackling and whooshing] [gasps] [eerie music] [Jessica] Emily? Emily?! Charlotte! [Jessica] Emily? [wood creaking] [Emily] I'm over here! Stay there! We have to stick together! [Emily] I can't see you! Follow my voice. - [Emily sobbing] - [Jessica] Charlotte! [trembling] Jessica, where are you? [Jessica] I'm here. [Emily crying] Follow my voice! Can you see us now? Emily, where are you? I can't see you! - [wood creaking] - [gasps] [Jessica] Em? - [wood creaking] - [water dripping] [creaking] [Emily screams] [blood dripping] What was that? [Jessica] Emily?! [eerie music] Emily. Emily. [screams] [Emily] Flora, she's... [screams] [A land a] Get her up! Get her up! Help me, Kirsten! All of you, help! [Jessica] Is she dead? [indistinct] [Amber] Of course she's dead. [overlapping chatter] [blood dripping] [eerie music] [whooshing] [girls screaming] [girls gasping] [door closes] - [A land a] Get the lights! - They're not coming on. [girls gasping] What the fuck is going on? Flora's face. Hanging like that. [Emily sobbing] [Kirsten] Don't you remember? Dr. Cooper? We saw it in class. And it's here too. [Emily crying] Here. This is a witch hunt. Now is not the time for games, Kirsten. We are not witches! And Charlotte's still out there! [wood creaking] What? [Jessica] It's you. What do you mean, it's me? You think I did that to Flora? That? Are you fucking kidding me? I don't know what I mean. I don't know, but I feel it! This has something to do with you! You're weird. There's something about you. Something really wrong. Where's Kate? She... she was in the basement when we left her to find Charlotte. She went out to turn on the genny. Oh my God. Somebody call the police! [Jessica] There is no signal here! [knocking on door] Kate? [Kate] Hey, let me in! It's Kate! Kate! Kate! Why would Kate be outside if the lights are still off? It might not be her. Of course it's her. Let her in, Amber. Maybe the genny is out of fuel? Let her in! Give me the key and I will let her in. There is a killer out there somewhere, Jess! [distorted] Amber, let me in. Open the door! Let her in! Kate! We need to make sure it's really her. [tense music] [distorted] Let me in, Amber. [pendant clinks] [Matthias snarling] [Kirsten] Matthias Alistair. [distorted] Please, let me in. [Amber] Heather Gray. Amber Gray. It's me. You must be Heather Gray's descendant. - [Matthias snarling] - [head thuds] [wood creaking] I want to go home. If that's not Kate, then who is it? I want to go home now! It's not Kate. Em, she probably left. She didn't see us when we went to the woods and she must have left. Okay, come on. Let's go home now. No, we need to stay here together until the police come. We need to find Charlotte. We need to leave. What about Kate? Listen to me. We have to leave right now. Kate's not here. Maybe she did leave. Amber's right. We need to go. We go to town, and we get help to find Kate and Charlotte. Charlotte's car? Where's the keys? - They fell. - [Jessica] I'll get them. - I'll come with you. - No. You stay here. If anything goes wrong, you can magic us out of here. - I'll go! Is there another way out of here? There's the old barrel hatch in the basement. [wood creaking] All right. Get back. Catch me if I fall, yeah? Yeah. - [hatch opens] - [A land a grunts] [A land a grunting] [thudding] [bell ringing] [A land a grunts] [loud rattling] Oh. [A land a panting] [crickets chirping] [owl hooting] [water dripping] [Emily] Yeah. [Amber] Wait for me. I'll find them. [wind whooshes] I know they're here somewhere. [keys clattering] I've got them! Come on! [girls squealing] [girls shrieking] [Jessica] Go, go, go, go, go! [Amber] Put the key. [Jessica shushing] [Charlotte gasping] [car engine revving] [girls shrieking] [car engine revving] [Charlotte screaming] [rope creaking] [Charlotte screaming] [tires screeching] [engine revving] [girls shrieking] [Charlotte screaming] - [car crashes] - [glass shatters] [wind whooshes] [A land a crying] Oh, my God. Oh my God, Charlotte. My god, did I kill her? Jesus, who killed her? Who put her there like that? I mean, who did that to her? Oh my God. Emily. - [A land a sniffles] - [Jessica] It wasn't you. We didn't see Charlotte. None of us. We couldn't help Emily. It was an accident. It was nobody's fault with Em. This was your fault. Your fault. Kirsten's right. You are a witch. You conjured this thing up and you better fucking get rid of it! Leave her alone. You shut up! What're you gonna do? Hmm? Fix it, witch. I can't. I don't know how. You must know. What happened in the basement. What happened in the basement? And at the initiation. You know it's Matthias. Who the fuck is Matthias? What happened in the basement? Please, Amber. We need you now. Who is Matthias? [Kirsten] The witch hunter. He swore to kill any descendant of Heather Gray. He's hunting Amber. He vowed that he would not stop until he killed the last witch in England. It was a bedtime story. My mother would tell me over and over again, the same one. About a bad man that would become a demon and I'd fight him. I just thought it was a fairy tale, a really dark fairy tale. That makes you the last Gray witch. You should have told us. You should never have joined us. I didn't know. And I didn't want to join your stupid coven anyway, remember? I don't want to! I did it for Kirsten. [A land a] Well, it's too late for that now! You just... you just need to get us out of here. [Kirsten] You conjured him up. There must be a way to return him to. where... wherever. Well, find it. Fast. I'm not going to die, not here, not like. not like the others. Shut up. I need to think. [sniffles] We need to get the lights on. I'm not having her do any spells in the dark. And we need to be able to see him. He is using the dark to hide from us. I want to see what's happening. You're right, Amber. You don't need anybody. You don't need friends. You can't keep them. You just get them killed! I'll turn the genny on. [A land a] I'll go. I'm stronger and faster. It could have got us when we were running back from the car. But it didn't. That must mean something, right? Maybe it's had enough? [wood creaking] This will have to do. I want you to watch from the window. Hey, Amber. If you see anything coming for me, you better scream. Come back. - [approaching footsteps] - [crickets chirping] [axe clanks] [eerie music] [axe swishes] [axe swishes] [wind whooshes] [breathing heavily] - [axe swishes] - [gasps] [crickets chirping] [owl hooting] [sighs] [dial clicks] [generator rumbles] [steady rumble] [generator dies down] [generator rumbling stops] Come. On. You bitch! [generator rumbles] - [wind whooshes] - [gasps] [gasps again] [whimpers] [lights buzz] Yes. Turn the lights off. I can't see. [running footsteps] [A land a crying and panting] Something's wrong. Kirsten? Kirsten? Kirsten, something's wrong. [A land a crying and panting] - [wood creaking] - Open it. A land a! A land a! Jess, come and help! A land a! [A land a panting] [Amber] A land a! A land a! - [axe cracks] - [gasps] [Kirsten screams] [thud] We should pray. The cellar doors are unlocked. [footsteps receding] [Jessica crying] [footsteps approaching] [Jessica crying] Jess. Jessica. Hey. Hey, look at me. He killed A land a. We're going to die. No. No. We can't. Don't you see? It's the power of three. Good things come in threes. It's a magic number. It's powerful. The witches in Macbeth, the Holy Trinity. Nothing can beat three. Tell her, Amber. Kirsten's right. Three. We have to survive if there are three of us. Everybody knows that. You really are a witch? I am. Then you can get us out of here? [Kirsten] She can. Because we're friends. We're gonna get through this, okay? Okay. So what do we do? We need to help Amber figure out just what power she has and how to kill this thing. [sniffles] I'm not going out there again. Nobody's going outside. One thing is clear. If he's not invited, he can't come in. We're safe if we stay inside. I have to go out there. I have to fight him. No. No. He's too strong out there. That fog, the dark. I'll bring him to us. No, no. It's okay. It's okay, Jess. I can do this. I can. But I'll need your help, both of you. We need to lay a trap. - [wood creaking] - [wind blowing] [water splashing] Ready? Ready. Ready. [♪♪♪] [girls breathing deeply] [wood creaking] [wind whooshing] Why doesn't he come? We need bait. One of us needs to be alone in here to lure him in. No. He'll come. [Kirsten] Think about it, all the others were on their own when he came. Too risky! I can do it. No, we stick together. We are not getting out of here until you kill him. That means that we need to lure him in. It's me he wants. We need to break the circle. The circle's keeping him away. [wind whooshes] It's okay, Jess. It's okay. [sighs] It's okay. Stay behind me. Stay close. [eerie whispers] The earth listens to me. The earth quakes at my word. The mighty Goddess is within me and I compel evil this night and forever to show your face so that you may be shamed. The Goddess has spoken. [words echoing] [Kirsten] What are you doing? I'm calling him up. The earth listens to me. The earth quakes at my word. The mighty Goddess is within me and I compel evil this night and forever to show your face so that you may be shamed. The Goddess has spoken! [pendant rustling] [wind blowing] [eerie music] [door slams] [wood creaking] [Matthias] [growling] Gray. [growling] Gray. [objects rattling] You know why I'm here. [Jessica thuds] [Matthias] You must die. Amber, get back. [Kirsten thuds] [Matthias] I made a vow. There will be no escape. You will die. [Amber gasping for air] Here you are, Gray. Alone. [Amber gasping for air] I've waited for you. Hell is waiting for you. [objects rattling] I can see into your black soul. [Amber groans] [objects clanking] [Matthias] You have power. Show it now. You killed Heather Gray. And many like her. [grunts] [grunts] [screams] [thuds] [Amber crying] [Kirsten] [voice-over] [echoing] The Goddess will keep you safe. The Goddess will keep you safe. Please, Amber, we need you now. The Goddess will keep you safe. [pendant rustles] You want to resist me. You will fail. Let us go and I will release you from the curse. [Matthias] It's not for you to release me. When my work is done, when this land is rid of witches, then I will be free. I just want to confirm that England will not be sullied by your kind. You have failed. [grunts] I exist because you have failed. You have slept for 500 years, and in that time, I have grown stronger. I am powerful because of you. I am the mighty Goddess. My power knows no bounds. Let evil know that it is Amber Gray who has destroyed Matthias Alistair. [Matthias snarling] [Amber chants in Latin] [in unison] By the mighty Goddess. - [Matthias screaming] - we drive you from here. Unclean spirit, satanic power, infernal invader, in the name of all those that you have killed, we release you from Purgatory and send your soul to Hell. - [Matthias screaming] [fire crackling] [pendant buzzing] [♪♪♪] [door creaks, closes] [unbuckles seat belt] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] ♪ - Hmm Hmm ♪ ♪ Hmm Hmm ♪ ♪ Her eyes ♪ ♪ Seem to twinkle With her smile ♪ ♪ She flips ♪ ♪ Her golden hair As you walk by ♪ ♪ She's tryin' desperately ♪ ♪ To be the girl you need ♪ ♪ As sweet as candy ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Like candy yeah ♪ ♪ Like candy yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah sweet as candy ♪ ♪ Yeah yeah ♪ ♪ She tries ♪ ♪ To get your attention With her eyes ♪ ♪ She'll tease ♪ ♪ Pretend she's just One of the guys ♪ ♪ She's tryin' to make you see ♪ ♪ That she is The girl you need ♪ ♪ As sweet as candy, yeah ♪ ♪ As sweet as candy, ♪ ♪ Yeah yeah ♪ ♪ Like candy ♪ ♪ Like candy ♪ ♪ Like candy ♪ ♪ Like candy ♪ ♪ Ah-ah ♪ ♪ Like candy ♪ [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
