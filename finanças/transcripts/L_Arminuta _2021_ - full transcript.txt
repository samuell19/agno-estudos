You arrived? Didn't your wife come? She does not move from the bed. Do you want a coffee? What is it to you? A distant uncle. To this day I have lived with him and his wife. So who is your mother? I have two of them. One is your mother. In a while this dress will no longer fit you. Next year you give it to me. You arrived? Listen to me. Don't leave me here, I have to help Mom. I'm not staying here, I don't know the ones up there. They are your real parents. - They love you, they were waiting for you. - It is not true. I don't even know them. If I have done something wrong I will not do it again. I won't bother you. Please dad. That's enough. The room is over there. Is there only this wardrobe? You sleep with your sister tonight you are so thin. We'll think about it tomorrow. We have to get head-to-toe otherwise we won't go in. You pissed in bed again. Good. We make ourselves known immediately. It wasn't me. Maybe it was your sister. With the education that she keeps her! How old are you? Thirteen. It proves more. You? Almost eighteen. - Do not you go to school? - I dropped her in the seventh grade. I was rejected anyway. Now I work for the day. Move. They are looking for people to work in the countryside. - Adriana? -She is out with Giuseppe. Did you put the chicken out? Here. Do you eat it like this? You have to remove the feathers first, then you cut it like this and finally you take out all its guts. Come on. I'm not able. I can clean the house. Outside is the bucket. If you feel bad, next time say it right away. Sorry, I thought it would pass. First to dad and then to her who passed out. If she is sick, she eats the broth not the thigh. This is not good for doing anything. It just does damage. Mom, can't you bring her back to the ones who held her before her? I'm not hungry anymore. Come on, Vincenzo is taking us to the rides. Wait a moment here. It's all OK? There's this girl who came home to us. This is the first time she has climbed a calcinculo. - Shall we show him around? - Of course. Come on. Here we go? Come on, Adriana. Run. Salts. Haven't you ever climbed it? My mother said it was dangerous. Hold tight to the chains and nothing will happen to you. Quiet young lady. Nothing happens to you. Do you want to start this merry-go-round instead of being a fool? Start this merry-go-round. Are you ready? Come on. Get it going. Quiet, miss. Nothing happens to you. How slow are you. Are you ready? Did you see the tail? Now you have to get it. Don't be afraid and reach out. Now it's yours. One, two, three... Take it. Extend your arm, miss. You have to stretch it! Do not be afraid. Are you ready? One, two, three... Take it! Go now. She reaches out her arm. Go, I'll join you later. Go. That doesn't come back. He went to the gypsies. The first time he went with the gypsies he was fourteen. After he helped them take down the rides he hid inside the truck. And didn't they kick him out? No. In fact, they carried it with them for a long time and they gave him a ring. When he got home, dad beat him up. But he kept the ring. He doesn't care that he gets beaten. And stronger than him. Adriana you have to pick up the clothes! Yes mom, now I'm coming! The first time he ran away, did you call the carabinieri? No, Dad was looking for him with the car. But was she at least crying? No, she was silent. Weren't you comfortable in town? I didn't decide to come here. My mom said I was grown up and my real parents wanted me back. Yes, sure, feel the comeback. Get it out of your head. Nobody was looking for you. You have to shut up. Adriana, leave her alone. Come here. Leave them alone, those. They play stupid with everyone. No, they are right. It wasn't yours who asked me back. - What are you saying? - Yours have nothing to do with it. I'm here because my mother is sick but she doesn't know how I am. If I tell her, she'll come get me back. Do you want to go? If you want then when I'm there I ask to take you too. Why do you write "dear mom"? She is not your mother. I don't care if she's my aunt. I call it that. She isn't even your aunt. Her husband is just a distant cousin of our father. However, she keeps the money. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Hello. - Hello. An envelope and a postage stamp please. - And two popsicles. - Lemon? One and two. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Until we meet again. - Until we meet again. - You take. - Switch to me. Pass. Switch to me! And now who's paying for all this stuff? It is already paid. Who knows what you said about us. I sleep here. What if I bathe this too? She also bought a waterproof tarpaulin. - Who bought? - My mother. No, my aunt. So, you don't go to her anymore? Yup! I don't get sleepy. Can you tell me something? It's late, sleep. One of the things you did before. In the summer we ate in the garden. I set up. With candles on the table and glasses of colored glass. As I set the table, I watched the people returning from the sea. The children with the lifebuoy still inflated. You could hear the sound of wooden clogs... Hello. And the smell of the sunscreen they had put on in the morning. Did you eat ice cream at home as well? Yes, but after the fish. And then? The sound of the waves could be heard. The sea was close. Didn't it bother? No, it was nice. Wake Up! Wake Up! Stupid! Cretin! Stoned, go to work! Why don't you send me back to where I was? Mother: I saw you once at a wedding. You were six or seven. I couldn't believe you were so big. There was also Adalgisa. She was chatting with a relative and she didn't realize I was there too. I called you and you raised your head. I was left open-mouthed perhaps because the tears were escaping me. I couldn't talk too much because you were little but then I gave her four to your aunt. Because? She promised that you would always come here to us, that we would raise you together. But we only saw you again on your first birthday. Then you moved house and nobody told us anything. She sent you these. Tomorrow we will go to the sea. - What about the money? - I have them. We can't the same. Alone it is dangerous. All right. But at home, no one has to know where we are going. Let's say you come to work with me in the countryside. All right? It's from here. Come and take a bath! What happens? I'm afraid it takes me and pulls me down. But no, come on, it's low. You come. Here I am. No, you go, I'll stay here. - Where did you learn to swim? - To the river. Come on, come here. Leave me, come on. That's enough... Come on. Do you want to go to the bar? They are three hundred lire. When you finish, join Vincenzo at the umbrella. I'll get there later. - Come on? - Yup. Hey. - Are you back? - Just for a few hours. Come on, come on. Did your parents accompany you? No. I haven't seen them since my father took me there. I meant yours now. How's it going with them? My father works in a quarry, but not always. And I have a sister, Adriana. - Loud How are you? Good. Have they gone away? We haven't seen them since. Maybe they treat you in a hospital away from home. Why do you think such a bad thing? I don't know anything about her anymore. She doesn't even call. - Are you staying for lunch with us? - No, I have to go, bye. Hello. - Are you coming back? - Of course. Adriana go buy cigarettes. Keep the rest. Run. Go. Come on and I'll show you something. You come. You come. Adriana is still small. She can't keep it a secret. You come. Sit down. Where did you get them? They paid me two days of work. It is impossible to earn so much in two days. What can you do? - I'm selling them back. - You're crazy? If you get caught with the stolen things, you end up in juvie. Who told you that they are stolen? My father is a carabiniere. Your father doesn't even think about you. I wanted to give you this. Looks good on you. Vincenzo, I brought you the cigarettes! Where are you? Did you bring any vegetables from the countryside? No. But do you make me do it all to myself? Come on. If I had come back. What time and which way is it? Past perfect subjunctive. Good. I would answer. What would I answer? Conditional way, present tense. Exactly. What are you doing here? I came to check if my sister is okay. She is from the city. Does your teacher know you went out? I said but maybe she didn't hear me because the males were playing devils. Teacher: Well, she will be worried about you now. I'll call a janitor and have you take you back to class. I don't need the janitor. I don't get lost. I just want to check if everything is okay for her. Adriana go to class. Go. So? So? Yes, a nice timbale... And also cheese and eggs... - When did she arrive? - Yesterday. No. Open it later. You have to settle here first. Where is my mother? Have you gone blind? The other one. I want to know what happened to her. I do not know. She's dead and you're not telling me? But how does she come to your mind? That lives a hundred years with the life she leads. They sent me to you because she is sick. And then I don't know. Will they come to take me back? No, you stay here. That's for sure. No, not her! Now I clean up! Get up, you! When I return I want to find everything clean. What have you done to yourself? - I hurt myself. Go buy milk for Giuseppe. Here are the coins. God! You should have taken it with me! Come here. Get off! You should have taken it with me. Not with a boy. Get off! Come here! Come here! Get off! You should have taken it with me. Get off! Come here! You should have taken it with me! Not with a boy! Get off! We eat soup tonight. Nobody is hungry anyway. Good morning. Good morning. Do you have dog scraps? We have to go back to school. Can you stop for a moment? It is the announcement of a literary competition. They reward the best science fiction story. But I don't write short stories. But you write well. Why don't you try it? The winner is given a savings book as a scholarship. Thank you. It's not about the money. It could be a great satisfaction. Until we meet again. What are you doing? I am writing a short story. What are you talking about? Of an alien. Of? Of someone like me. Eat some cans. I have an headache. I can't cook. Here. My mother of the sea always made me eat oranges. I told her you have to go back to town to do good things. Your father and I have been thinking about it ever since you came back. You have to go to a good school next year. Adalgisa agrees. So they take me back. No, that is not. But when the time comes, she'll take care of settling you in town. Why did she come while I was not there? Couldn't she wait for me? The lady who accompanied her was in a great hurry. Adalgisa learned about my poor son late. She wanted to visit me. How "late"? My father came to the funeral! Obviously your uncle didn't tell him. How are you? Will you let me rest now? - How are you? - Not bad. Did you see how much stuff she brought us? Have you gone crazy? What's wrong with you now? Leave me. I am not a package. And you have to stop moving me here and there. I want to meet my mother. Now you tell me where she is and I go there alone. I don't know where she is. She is not staying in the house she used to be. Then I find a judge and sue you all. I tell him that you are exchanging a daughter like a parcel. Where are you? Where have you gone? Look, if you don't come back, I'll stay here and get sick because of you. Look, I'm leaving. Actually no, I'm staying here. And in this cold I don't know what happens to me. Did you understand? Here, put this on or you'll get a fever. You take. Beware that it is heavy. It is a hot brick. I kept it inside the oven. Happy birthday. Here it is. You have won the contest. Here is your prize. The savings book. You were good. I leave you alone. Until we meet again. How long does it fit? This money does not touch. I'm for her. Hi buddy, how are you? That is Comare Carmela. She and she very old. She is a sorceress. She thinks she once she was in death for so many days then she got fed up and came back here. Mistress Carmela... I know, my daughter, how you feel but for the evil you have I don't have the medicine. You were born under an evil star but she she will give you some satisfactions How old was I when you gave me to your cousin? Six months. She had been trying to have children for a long time but she didn't come. At first, I said no to Adalgisa. Then I got pregnant with a new baby and your dad lost his job. We had a whole night's discussion, your father and I. We told her yes. Then I lost the other child. You come. She was the best in school. Listen to me. Classical high school next year. She is out, she is up to me. - Yes No. - Hello. - Hi, Ernesto. At four, come to the bar. A phone call will come for you. Ready. He how are you? How are you? I know you were the best in school. I expected that. Your mother may have already told you that we want to send you to a good high school. You deserve it. So I'm going home. I thought I'd settle you at the Ursulines. And a great college. I'll take care of the expenses. But why can't I go home? What have I done to you? Nothing, now I can't explain to you. But I really want you to continue with your studies. Everything is alright? Is dad there with you? No, it's the TV. Hi sweetie. Have a good summer. You deserve it. Ready? Ready? I convinced the others to wait for you. Move that they are bored. Play without me. I don't feel like it anymore. What's wrong with you now? We were winning. I said I don't like it! Get out! It's the fault of that one! It does not matter! But did you really think he was going to get you back? She can't because she is sick. She just wants to protect me. You still believe in fairy tales. She that she was pregnant! - But she is sterile. She can not. -You know that her husband was not capable. Now she has a baby girl. And she is not the daughter of the carabiniere. This is why all this mess happened. Everybody knows. Why didn't you tell me she was expecting a baby? She wanted to tell you. But then the time passed and she never saw herself again. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to wait for you to grow up a little before giving you this sorrow. Hi, how nice. What happened to my mother? Is it true that she had a baby girl? Where do you live? Where is she? Hello. Hello. How are you? Isn't the girl there? She's at home. I love you but I wasn't alone in deciding. You are happy now? I would like to introduce you to it, but now I can't. Why don't you come to lunch with us in a few days so maybe we can talk about your studies too? Here you are. Tighten. Like this. Bigger though I don't know if I want to go there. Accept. Remember that Adalgisa raised you. If it weren't for her now you would be a farmhand in the countryside. She was wrong. But you can't keep a snout for life. Here. You speak Italian, please. Apart from bread, do not touch anything with your hands. Use cutlery. If you don't know what to do, she looks at me. Behave yourself. We were expecting a young lady and two came. Sorry I was unable to warn you. There is no problem. You're welcome. Over there. Adalgisa is putting the baby to sleep. But how? Aren't you staying with us? No, she has already had lunch. She now she has to rest. What's your name? Adriana. Do you want to see the others too? You come. Look. They are all lined up. You see? One two three four. Look at this one here. You like? This one here looks like she goes to the sea, because she pushes in there like that. - Guess which is the oldest? - That. But have you already seen the date? Crazy. In fact, there is written 1690. Do you know how old I am? It matters a little... Guido. I told you a lot about her and finally here she is. Did you introduce yourself? Of course. We need to add a dish. - She's... - Adriana. I'm glad you're there too. What do you say, shall we sit at the table? Come on. You come. I'm going to get you a plate. Here it is. What am I doing with all these? Here you are. Do you taste it? But is it the fish? Yup. It looks like a worm. Good? Yes, good. Do you want some water? Yes thanks. Thank you. Sorry. No dear. Stay there, eat. Francesca must respect the timetables. But she is crying. They are just whims. They should not be indulged. Maybe he's sick. She now she passes them and falls asleep. How dare you touch my daughter? She had her little hand stuck in the bars of the cot. That's why she was crying, it hurt. Thanks for the lunch. It was all delicious. Now it's better if we go. But we're just getting started. I also did the second one, I made the desserts. Maybe for next time.
