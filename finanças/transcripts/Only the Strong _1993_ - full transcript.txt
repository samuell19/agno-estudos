[Man] FORGET IT, BUDDY. HE'S GONE. LINCOLN HIGH FINDS ITSELF BEING CONSUMED BY A BLOODY REIGN OF TERROR THAT WAS UNLEASHED WHEN THE INSTRUCTOR OF AN EXPERIMENTAL MARTIAL ARTS PROGRAM CROSSED SWORDS WITH LOCAL GANG MEMBERS. TODAY, BOTH STUDENTS AND FACULTY MEMBERS ALIKE ARE ASKING THEMSELVES WHY. WAS THE DEATH OF A 17-YEAR-OLD STUDENT AND THE HOSPITALIZATION OF TWO TEACHERS A FAIR PRICE TO PAY FOR A DUBIOUS PROGRAM WHICH WE NOW LEARN HAD NO OFFICIAL AUTHORIZATION FROM THE CITY SCHOOL BOARD? THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE TOUGH QUESTIONS THAT LINCOLN HIGH PRINCIPAL DONALD COCHRAN WILL BE FACING WHEN HE GOES BEFORE THE BOARD THIS AFTERNOON. YOU, OUT OF MY OFFICE, OFF OF MY CAMPUS! IF I SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN, SO HELP ME, I'LL HAVE YOU ARRESTED! ESCORT HIM TO THE SIDEWALK. AVOID THE CAMERAS. MR. COCHRAN, THE PROGRAM WORKED. HE TURNED THEM AROUND. YOU SAW IT-- MISS WALKER! IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT YET, THIS KUNG FU BUSINESS IS OVER, TERMINATED, BANISHED FROM OUR CAMPUS, ALONG WITH THIS SCUM BUCKET WHO BROUGHT IT HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GET HIM OUT OF MY SIGHT! [Shouting, Chattering] [Whistle Blows] ONE, TWO, THREE. ONE, ONE, TWO, THREE. TWO, ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR. ONE-- WHAT'S THE MATTER, GEEK? YOU GOT A PROBLEM KEEPING UP WITH THE REST OF THE CLASS? MR. STEVENS. YOU GOT A HEARING PROBLEM TOO? JUST A SECOND, OKAY? LANDO DIDN'T SHOW UP TODAY. I DON'T THINK HE'S SHOWING UP NO MORE. HEY, WIMP. IF ANYBODY NEEDS THIS EXERCISE, YOU DO. WELL, MR. CAPO-WHATSIS. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MESSING WITH MY STUDENTS ANYMORE. OKAY, HOTSHOT, LET'S GO. I GOTTA GO NOW. YOU WATCH OUT FOR YOURSELF. I HEAR THEY'RE LOOKING FOR YOU. YOU KNOW WHO I MEAN. COME ON, COME ON, COME ON. [Whistle Blows] [Grunting, Yelling] [Yelling] I AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. GUESS YOU KNOW THAT. YEAH. I GUESS YOU AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE IN SCHOOL ANYMORE, EITHER, HUH? HEY, I DIDN'T HAVE TOO MUCH OF A CHOICE, ALL RIGHT? YEAH. I CAN SEE THAT. LOOK. YOU GOTTA LEAVE, MAN. I MEAN, GET OUT OF MIAMI, OUT OF FLORIDA, FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN GO. "YANKEE, GO HOME." WHERE HAVE I HEARD THAT BEFORE? THIS TIME IT'S NO BULLSHIT. THEY'RE GONNA KILL YOU. THIS TIME IT'S MY HOME. THIS TIME I DON'T LEAVE UNTIL IT'S OVER. SO HOW'D YOU FIND OUT WHERE THE CAR SHOP WAS? YOUR COUSIN'S QUITE FAMOUS AROUND HERE. SO WHAT YOU GONNA DO? HE'S GOT AN ALIBI FOR ALL THAT SHIT THAT WENT DOWN AT THE SCHOOL. AIN'T ONE PERSON IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD GONNA SPEAK OUT AGAINST HIM. THEY'RE EITHER SCARED, OR ELSE THEY THINK HE'S ROBIN HOOD. COPS CAN'T TOUCH HIM, AND YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE ONE MORE DEAD BODY IF YOU GO AFTER HIM. YEAH, LIKE DONOVAN? HE WAS YOUR FRIEND, ORLANDO. HE WAS MY FRIEND. GONNA FORGET ABOUT HIM JUST LIKE THAT? MAN, I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU ENDING UP LIKE HIM. YOU KNOW WHAT MR. KERRIGAN SAYS IN HIS CLASSES? ALL THAT CRAP ABOUT ONLY THE STRONG SURVIVE? WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, MESTRE. NO AMOUNT OF CAPOEIRA, NO AMOUNT OF GREEN BERET BULLSHIT, NONE OF THAT GONNA MAKE YOU STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE ON AN ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD BY YOURSELF. THEN HE'LL JUST KEEP ON BEING THE MASTER OF THE PLANTATION. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I WANT. THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS! UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. ANYBODY KNOW WHERE I CAN BUY A HOT MERCEDES? [Yelling, Grunting] [Motor Revving] [Yelling] [Screeching] [Men Shouting] HEY. HEY.
