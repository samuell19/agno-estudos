THE LAW OF THE BORDER A DADA? FILM PRODUCTION FILMED AT YILDIZ FILM STUDIOS Music / Sound Engineer Assistant Cameraman / Editor Original Story by Screenplay Cinematography by Directed by Peace be upon you, Ali Cello. And upon you, Hasan Dervi?. Have a seat. Thank you, I will. I could use some tea. I'm dead tired. The sun has me beat. I can't go on. The sheep, the trading - some life! I don't know why I do it. You have every right to complain. Any news? They shot the lieutenant. Again? Who did it? One of the landowner's men. He was trying to cross the border. The lieutenant was wounded, but the shooter was killed. Then I've come at the right time! We must get the flock across at once. It's not that easy. They've heightened surveillance. A new lieutenant is on the way. It isn't a good time. What about my sheep? What will they eat and drink? Come now. Show me what you're made of. Let's wait and see. See what? Just wait a week. A week? - Welcome, Lieutenant. - Thank you. I'm Lieutenant Zeki Ergi?n. - They called to say you were coming. Which village were the attackers from? It was one man, from Deliviran. His relatives have the body. - Let's go. - We should bring a soldier or two. Hop in. - Wait here. - I should come too. These men - Don't worry. The commandant is here. Welcome, Commandant! - Are you the headman here? - Yes. - Who are the dead man's kin? - His kin? We're all his kin! Who works for the landowner? Hidir and his men. What you've done is unacceptable. You're heading down a path of no return. It ends now! Headman! Be warned: If this continues, we'll clear out the village. My condolences. WARNING - LAND MINES The gendarmerie in Ceylan. Light the area with flares. To Pinar! You can go now. You'll be housed here, sir. I brought your bags. This way, please. Lieutenant Sabri also lodged here. I'm afraid it's all we have. The teacher, Ay?e, is also staying here. Good-bye. And you said he couldn't do it. Hasan, you're invincible. Just you wait and see. - Those 3,000 sheep - - How much will you pay me? - The usual. - What? Times have changed. Have you no fear of God? I do fear God: You saw that commandant! Not even a bird can get across now. Hidir got across yesterday. Peace be upon you. - And upon you. - Join us. Thanks, but the goods arrived. - What did I tell you? - Whose goods? I don't know. Cabbar told me. They must be Hidir's. Cabbar will know. Must be the previous shipment. Let's go have a look. What did I tell you? Peace be upon you. And upon you, my lions. Welcome. Hidir, my hero, my lion, the apple of my eye! I said you'd make it across. No one believed me. What did you bring? Thank you. I have 3,000 sheep in the corral. - May you see them prosper. - Thank you. Don't let them starve there. It would be such a shame. You're like a son to me, the apple of my eye. In the name of God, it would be a sin to let them die. - I'll give you 4,000. - Fine. Hidir! My lion! If those sheep don't get across, I'm ruined! Hidir, in the name of God, listen to me! Hidir, I'll be ruined! - Welcome. - Delighted to be here. I'm Lieutenant Zeki Ergi?n. You must be the teacher. No, that's Ay?e. She isn't back from school yet. I'm the landlord. The name's Hayri. Pleased to meet you. I've brewed some tea for you. Please help yourself. My apologies, but I must step out. Certainly. Don't worry about me. We're very sorry about Sabri. Come join us, Ay?e. Lieutenant Ergt?n has replaced Sabri. - Nice to meet you. Any news about Sabri? He's in stable condition, but still in the hospital. Pardon me. I must go. Ay?e, will you please play host? The tea is brewing. - Please don't go to any trouble. - No trouble at all. You probably didn't get much sleep. Oh, here it is. - How long have you been here? - Five years. I've gotten used to it. But I'll be transferred soon. Far away? To a nearby village. Probably Deliviran. Ah... Have you been there? What's it like? - You know the villages around here? - A few. It's like the others, but very close to the border. I beg you, Hidir, apple of my eye, my 3,000 sheep! Say something, for the love of God! I can pay in advance. Money up front. My son, apple of my eye, say something! If those sheep don't get across, I'll be ruined! At least give me a drop of water! Hidir, wait for me! Hidir, listen to me. If they don't get across before the 10th of the month, I'm ruined! Say something, for the love of God! I'll be ruined! I'll perish! Listen to me! Hidir, listen to me! Wait! Welcome, gentlemen. Have a seat, Commandant. Bring some tea. - Don't bother. We'll be brief. That's contraband, isn't it? - No, I ordered it. - Is it Hidir's? Whoever said that is lying! I swear to God! It just arrived. I ordered it three months ago from Istanbul. Show the commandant the invoice. Would you like an ayran? - Thanks. Some other time. Here's the invoice. I ordered it three months ago. Very well. Show me your papers. The invoices. - All the goods are suspect. - We must stop this. But the invoices make it hard to confiscate anything. Thieves know how to cover their tracks. - Ismail, you getting married? - Is there enough money? God willing, there will be. Right, Hidir? With Hasan's flock - Drink, Abuzer! Abuzer's like a well. He'll drink anything. He's never sated. And your three wives - are you sated with them? Zeliha, S?mme, and now Akgelin? That's enough! Don't start making trouble! We'll cut you down to size! Hidir, let's take Hasan's flock across. With that money we can be our own bosses. Our own bosses? This work is a dead end. We risk our lives yet get paid so little. We're laborers, nothing more. Duran, Hasan, and Abdul Resul - they live very different lives. They have money - lots of it! But if we get Hasan's flock across, we'll be set. What do you think, Hidir? Hasan works with Ali Cello. Why's he coming to us now? The border's heavily guarded. Ali knows that. All Hasan cares about is his business and his flock. Who cares about us? Hasan doesn't care whether we live or die, as long as his flock gets across. Is that just? - We got across yesterday! - That was luck. You have to fight back if you want to survive. He'll pay us well, Hidir - 15-20 lira a head. 3,000 sheep - what's that add up to? I'll tell you: It adds up to us being strung across barbed wire. He's right. We should wait a couple weeks. Let's see what happens. Now I've got you! Come here, you! Peace be upon you. - The crossing is ready. - Did you survey it well? It's near the village of Muslin. One sheep crossed this morning. Keep your eyes peeled. We'll try with 250 sheep. The rest can cross tomorrow. Move them out. If they don't all get across, I'm dead. If you fail, I'll hound you into the afterlife. - You've got nine lives! - That's what you think. Move in! Give yourselves up! Some people came from the Education Board. They want to open a school in the village. A what? How? You know, a school. They want to open one. At our age? - Are they really opening one? - No. The headman told them we're all incompetent, that we can't even build our own houses! I said that the children are out in the fields with the flocks. There's no need for a school. - And then? - They went away. They're going to the district head. - You hear that? My heroes, my hawks, my lions! Welcome to town! You came to town without letting me know? The superintendent of schools went to Deliviran this morning. The villagers refused. Said there's no building for a school. We'll see what happens. They're a stubborn bunch. They don't want a state employee snooping around. - Hello, Ali Cello. - Was this our agreement, Hidir? What agreement? You think it's right to steal our job? No one stole your job. Get lost! You mean taking Hasan's flock across? You failed at it. Did you tip them off? We'd have gotten across, but someone tipped them off. Really? Don't try it! Break it up! The lieutenant sent me. He wants to speak with you. The rest of you behave or I'll lock you up. - Don't get any funny ideas. - What ideas? You know what I'm talking about. Come in. Sit down. Thank you. Hidir, this has to stop. You left no tracks, but I know you crossed the border. How's Yusuf? He's fine, thank you. There's another problem. They want to open a school, but you won't let them. You really think that's best? What will happen to Yusuf? You want him to be like you? Look at me. That school must open. It could save all the children. That's what a real man would do... not risk his life at the border. A real man conquers himself. It isn't easy. That's all I have to say. Who was shooting? You think it's easy building a school? We don't even know how to build a roof. You can't just build it out of adobe. You need walls, glass, wood - - Notebooks, books. - That's right. Notebooks, books, pens - it all costs money. Who will graze the sheep? That too! We'll go and tell them all this tomorrow. I'll go too. - Peace be upon you. - Upon you as well. We'll take Hidir along to deal with this school business. The school won't cost anything. Classes can be held in the guest house. Our village will be famous for the school in its guest house. Hidir! Do we really need a school? Dear citizens! This day will shine rays of hope on our entire district. Your children will open new horizons for all of you. On this wonderful occasion it's a great honor for me to open this school in your village. Go on! - So what happens now? - It's obvious. We can't smuggle anything across the border now. Nothing at all. It's over. - Then we're done for. - That's right. The teacher will know everything. The superintendent and commandant will come. They'll be checking everything. Our hands will be tied. We won't be able to do anything. What about lsmail's wedding? Come and see us again, sir. This is my present for you. You did the right thing. You don't think so? It was the right thing... but now they all resent me. - Can't you work the land? - The land? This land is no good. It's all sand. But all this is empty. That's Duran's field. I'll talk to him. You can be sharecroppers. - He won't agree. - What if he does? I'll see to it, but I must have your word. We have an agreement, then? See you soon. What are you thinking? You want to chain us to the land? - Duran will never agree. - And if he does? - You don't want to work the land? - Are you joking? How would we survive until harvest? - What about lsmail's wedding? - I don't know how to plow. We'd have to buy seed, plows, animals. What would we have left to eat? - We can get all that from Duran. - You think he's crazy? Who'll take care of the flock? Then we'll farm and smuggle. With the teacher here? In this way we'll be supporting them. The land unites those who farm it. Yes, but unfortunately these are lawless men. They're unpredictable. They say one thing and do another. There's no harm in trying. They agreed to the school. They have potential. It would be wonderful to bring out the best in them. We don't mind trying, but it could prove costly. The animals could suffer. Just give it a try. I'm at your service. Aziz will do whatever's needed. Thank you from me and from them. You're welcome. I'm always at your service. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. - What's this all about? - Is there a problem? But what if that flock arrives tomorrow? Listen closely and tell this to Hidir. Tell him I'll pay 25 lira per head. That's my final offer. - I'll consider it. - He has to think about it! Hasan, what's happening with the flock? I haven't sold it yet. I'll be ruined if I don't sell it by month's end. Then you're already ruined. Not even a bird can cross now, let alone sheep. All you can do is send greetings. So what do I do with my sheep? If I were you - Who'll buy them if they can't get across? That's up to you. A customer can always be found. Meaning? You know of someone? No. Just thought I'd give you a little advice. Is Yusuf your son? He works hard. He'll learn quickly. I want him to study. Do you miss the horse? Yes, but school is better. Good boy. Go and play. - Will he be able to learn? - All children can learn... if they start early. - Is it too late for Yusuf? No, he's very intelligent. Do you want him to study? You could study too. I was just like Yusuf, always in the saddle behind my father, on horseback all day long, from the border to the village. But then one day, at the border, my father stepped on a land mine. The land will save you. I'm a farmer's daughter. The land brings joy to those who tend it and yields up its fruits. - Let's hope for the best. - What do you think, headman? God is almighty. But the others won't leave them in peace. Peace be upon you. Hold it. What's the sergeant doing in the village? - Ask the teacher. - She has nothing to do with it. Is that right? lsmail's wounded. At least he isn't dead. - You weren't there. - I couldn't be. We gave our word. We must honor our word. - It was your word, not mine. Don't be so stubborn. This isn't who we are. Who knows what Duran is thinking? The commandant knows nothing about our lives. The land, the school - they won't improve our lives. Duran has sent for me. It's all that teacher's fault. It'll end badly if she doesn't leave. Drop it, Bekir, or you can leave. End of story. This is Duran's man. - How many sheep is it? - Around 2,700. Fifty died of thirst. Bring them to our pasture tomorrow morning. - Good-bye. - Go in peace. These sheep are dying of thirst. Let's take them to the pasture. Duran, did you send for me? We bought these sheep. May they prosper. They'll die if they stay here. - Take them to your pasture. - They're crossing the border. - You hear that? - Hidir... I don't do that anymore. - You think farming will be enough? - It's our fate. I gave you that chance, and I can take it away again. No one can take anything until the harvest. We agreed. You'd bite the hand that feeds you? God knows you've fed us, but we've made great sacrifices as well. I'll be in the village if you want to talk. I could have taught him a lesson. You'll get your chance. I'm listening. You'll take Hidir some news from me tonight. Brother... Duran's man is bringing the sheep across the fields! I've come for Yusuf. I don't want him to stay here. I'll be all alone. This shouldn't have happened. It's my fault. That's not true! You - I'll take Yusuf. - And then? - He'll study. If he takes after his father, he'll be a great man. I want to give him the opportunities you never had. Stay back! Put that away. Hidir, listen to me! I'm done listening! Give yourself up! Leave! I'm not surrendering, and I'm not listening! The school, the field, Bekir! Aziz is dead! Look what's happened. I didn't want it to come to this! Now gm! All right, Hidir. Have it your way. I have no choice. I don't need Hidir, but I can't lose this deal. Ali Cello's ready to go across. - Think it over. - What's to think over? I sold all my sheep to you. I'm desperate. Let's work together. I'll take the loss. We'll share the profit. - Let's talk to Ali Cello first. - Why? Why so quiet all of a sudden? Very good! You write it like this. Now have some breakfast. Good morning. Is there some news? Yusuf, you're a big boy now, right? The provincial government approved the proposal. We're clearing out your village. And... I have to arrest your father. I hope you'll keep studying. Maybe you'll become a soldier like me. Then you'll understand why I must do this. Your father isn't a bad man. We even became friends. But this is how it is. Don't cry, Yusuf. Do you miss your father? My father is bold and brave and good. That's right. Be like him, but study as well. Peace be upon you. Is Hidir here? Thank God I found you! I've crossed rivers and climbed mountains to get to you. Divine justice has no limit, my son. May God protect you! The wrongdoer has been punished. God is great. I took back the flock that I sold to him. What do you want? I'll give you 30 lira a head. I want this burden off my shoulders. Say yes. Find me a mine clearer. Give me your hand. You're like a nephew to me! - We'll split the profits. - That's how you treat your uncle? All right, fine! All right! We'll split it half and half! What a tragedy! This isn't a flock, it's a disaster! Peace be upon you. - Where's Hasan? - He took off with a crippled man. Let's go. The G?zalan area is mined, so it's secure. Make sure you secure the other crossings. Call in backup if needed. A while back they cleared the mines around Pinar. Pay particular attention there. - Yes, sir. Here's Pinar. Here's Ceylan. These areas are guarded. If they have reinforcements, they'll place them here, in spots they know. This is G?zalan. It's full of mines. They won't put guards there. You have to clear this area. Well? - I'll start tomorrow. - No, tonight. I'll give you 5,000 lira. It's a deal. Greetings. Please, come and sit. Peace be upon you. Please, sit. Ali Cello was looking for me. If he has heard, he won't give up. He can go to hell. He can look for me all he wants! WARNING - LAND MINES Are you working for Hidir? Please don't! - It's done. - All cleared? Good work! We'll cross this evening. We'll cross now. - Thank you. - Wait. You're coming with us. As you wish. Come on, let's cross. This has to end somewhere. You want Ali Cello to get away that easily? Ali Cello and his men are fighting in the streets! Seal off the area! - It's my father. - How could it be? He's in another town. - It's him! - Come back! Yusuf, come back! Papa! My horse is at the fortress gate. Wait for me there. Go on now. Hidir, give yourself up! Stop! We'll take two vehicles. Meet me at the gate. Papa! Don't shoot. You could hit the child. Come on. Run to the teacher's house. Go! I'll come get you. Papa! Hidir, give yourself up! Hidir, give yourself up! - Papa! - Hidir! Hidir! Yusuf, stop! Papa! My son... Papa! THE LAW OF THE BORDER Directed by
