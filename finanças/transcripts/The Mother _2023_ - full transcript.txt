[FBI Agent 1] Okay. Tape ID number 703. Time of day, 6:14 a.m. Interview with informant resumes. Please restate the names of these two men. [informant] Hector Álvarez. Adrian Lovell. - You introduced them? - [informant] Yes. You brokered an arms deal between them? [informant] Yes. And you were in a relationship with both of them? [Informant] Yes. [FBI Agent 1] All right. Okay. Help me get the food chain right. Hector Álvarez was supplying Adrian Lovell with weapons. What kind of weapons? [informant] This place isn't secure. Lady, stop telling us our jobs. We can take you in if you want. - You don't know how bad this gets. - [FBI Agent 1] Then tell us. Here. Look, I get that this is dark, so why don't we start with the weapons Álvarez is supplying? Soviet PKM machine guns, LAWS rocket launchers, M18 claymore mines. It's not the point. [FBI Agent 1] Actually, it is. They want you dead for what you know, right? We need to talk about my deal. I'm sick of the bridge tournament this bitch is playing. If you need our protection... You wouldn't know the first thing about protecting me. Hey. You're safe here. No, I'm not. [FBI Agent 2] Álvarez is in Cuba, Lovell's under surveillance. We've had a tail on him since the second he landed at O'Hare. - Then he knows where we are. - [chuckles softly] Let me tell you... You think you're following him? He's following you. If you think you're gonna dictate how we conduct an interrogation, - I don't know who you... - [silenced gunshot] [silenced gunshots] - [grunts] - [body thuds] Agents down, shooter outside. Hawthorne? Carter? Do you copy? Are we breached? Do you copy? [mouthing] Come. [silenced gunshot] - Not the window, don't... - [silenced gunshot] [grunts] - No, let me get... - Shh! [FBI Agent 1] Am I gonna die? I don't know. [FBI Agent 1 groaning softly] [coughs] [glass shatters in distance] I know you're in there. Did you think you could hide from me? You must have known I'd find you. [groans] [breathes deeply] Adrian. [screams] [gasps] [whimpering] No. [whimpers] [gas whistling] [grunts] [exclaims] [nurse] It's a girl. [baby crying] [Mother] Is she okay? [nurse] She's perfect. [exhales deeply] Gimme the room. Special Agent Williams. How are you? - Where's my baby? - She's in the nursery. She was very fortunate. I wanna see her. Well, what you want is no longer the deciding factor in what happens next. You wasted 12 hours of FBI time trying to cut a deal for yourself and seven agents were killed. This conversation now takes place on our terms. You can't keep her from me. I'm her mother. What you are to that child right now is a death sentence. Adrian Lovell and Hector Álvarez represent ruthless business interests. If you leave here with that child, they will kill her. Lovell already stabbed a pregnant belly. What would he do to a live child? Adrian Lovell is dead. Lovell was extracted from the house fire before backup arrived. His body was never accounted for. [sighs] Your daughter will be placed in witness security... My daughter is not going into the foster system. ...so no one knows who her mother is. You underestimate my ability to protect my child. Yeah, well, I'm aware. Back-to-back tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, 46 confirmed kills, accurate to 1,300 meters with an M24. Tell me how that helps her. You and I both know the only way you protect that child is to disappear. [voice breaking] And if I don't? They'll find you. Both of you. [knock at door] And just so you know, the FBI has a terrible record of protecting the whereabouts of people who caused the death of federal agents. [scoffs] Termination of parental rights. Sign when you're ready. [pen clatters] - Let her in. - [man] You sure? She's good. Hey. They just told me. You all right? Three things. One, you put her with good people. I want her to have the most boring, stable life there is. It's a girl? Two, you let me know she's safe, every birthday. Three, if there's trouble... you let me know. I owe you that. [baby crying] [man] Is she yours? No. [switch clicks] Don't sneak up on somebody with PTS... Well, now I'm really fucking triggered. [man] You'll need a job. Some of the ranchers would pay good money for shooters like you. Get rid of the wolves. I don't wanna shoot wolves. You found God or something? No. [knock at door] It's good. Thanks. - If you want... - I don't want anything, Jons. Hey. We're all lost when we get out. I got more than lost. Whatever you've done, you're still here. Still time to make it right. Anybody sees us in town, you don't know me. It's that bad? [animal growling] [growling] [barks, growls] [growling] [pups yipping] [gun cocks] [pups yipping, barking] [gun cocks] Another birthday. Let's see how big she got. It's not her birthday. [indistinct chatter] [Mother] She's in trouble? We gonna say hello first? Hello. Civilization is built on the little things. Tell me what's going on, Cruise. ATF busted some of Hector Álvarez's men at a stash house in Nuevo Laredo. Typical stuff. MK12s, you know, bump stocks, silencers. But they also had this. The six men are in custody in Mexico. - We wanted you to ID them. - [scoffs] You didn't bring me here for a lineup. I keep my promises. - I will protect her. - Can't advise you on that. What's her name? You can tell me her name now. Her name is Zoe. It's Greek for "life." [indistinct chatter] [woman laughing] - [woman] Okay, that was close. Almost. - Almost! [woman laughing] [dog barking in distance] [indistinct chatter] Hey, there. [tires screeching] I know you. - [car horn blares] - [tires screeching] [man 1 groans] [crowd screaming] - [woman] Hey! - [man 2] Come on! [man 2 groans] [gun fires] [car horns blaring] [Zoe] Please, stop! Mom! Zoe! Vamos, vamos. - [tires screeching] - [woman] No! [tires screeching] - [car door opens] - [groans] [car alarms blaring] [car alarms continue blaring] [engine starts] [tires screeching] [man groans] [tires screeching] [sirens wailing] [grunts] - You okay? - Go! Drive! [tires screeching] You knew this was coming. You should've had people. I couldn't know how or when. I couldn't know what Hector was... And you couldn't set up a standard perimeter? Obviously that was beyond what I expected. That was Hector's top lieutenants. Yes, Yanil Gonzalez, the one who grabbed her. Tarantula. There's a change of clothes next to you. - [exhales heavily] - I made you three promises. I kept them all and did what I could to keep her a secret. Well, the secret's out. [sighs] Whose clothes are these, some desk cop? They're my sister's. We have a team setting up at the house. We'll wait for a ransom call. - There won't be any call. - What do they want? Me. They can have a nice, long look at me while I kill every last one of them. And then what? Then I get the kid back to her parents. They did a good job. [indistinct police radio chatter] [indistinct chatter] Bathroom? She's using the facilities. [officer] Secure the backyard. [Cruise] Any guesses where we're going? Straight back to Cuba. We're married? Great place for a honeymoon. ["Mala Mía" by Maluma plays] [indistinct chatter, laughter] [speaking indistinctly in Spanish] Hey... [clicks tongue] - [in Spanish] Throw away the gun. - Calm down. Where's the girl? What's he done with her? [groans] - [man 1 groans] - [man 2 grunts] - [panting] - [woman exclaims] [car horn honks] [both grunting] [car horns blaring] - [tires screeching] - [man yells in Spanish] [woman yells in Spanish] [both groaning] [both panting] [car horns blaring] [church bell tolling] - [grunts] - [nun exclaims] [woman exclaims] [grunts] [both grunt] Count those tiles. He's a cheater. - Shut up, old woman! - I won't shut up! [both panting] [Tarantula] Stop that bitch! [men exclaiming] Get the hell out of my house!

[Mother] Hector está en la plantación. [in Spanish] What about the girl? Where's the girl? [Tarantula] What girl? [chuckles] [grunts] [in English] I'm asking the fucking questions! - [in Spanish] Where's the girl? - [Cruise] I don't think he knows. - [in Spanish] What'd he say? - [in English] Want me to tell? Let me translate. So this is how you interrogate. [in Spanish] What happened? [laughs] You get tired? Hector's whore. [both grunting] [in English] Okay. Okay. Okay. - [laughing] - Hey. - [Mother panting] - [sighs] [Mother] Hector wants me there, right? But I'm not going in blind. [breathes heavily] Hold him back. [in Spanish] Where you going? You gonna kiss me? Huh? [gurgling] [in English] You learn things in the service. [gasping] The bubbles sting like hell, right? Now... [in Spanish] Tell me, asshole. Where's the girl? La Plantación. Efila. - What's waiting for me? - [chuckles] How many guards? All of them. [in English] It's a trap. I don't care. As long as we get Zoe, they can have me. [in Spanish] He doesn't want you. And the things he's gonna do to her, she's never gonna forget. - [laughing] - [grunts] [Cruise, in English] We gotta go. - [man whistles] - [indistinct chatter] Here, let me help. So, you're not just barbed wire around a fist. I'm whatever I need to be to keep her safe. Including turning yourself into a ghost. Feel that? You could've let me die, but you didn't. You saved me. Why? [water sloshing] You gave me water. At the safe house. It's like you knew I was thirsty all the time. You were taking care of me and my baby. Felt like a man worth saving. How'd you get involved in all this shit? You and Lovell and Álvarez. I don't get it. Afghanistan. I want those targets on fire! [Mother] Lovell was ex-SAS, training my sniper unit. The trick is to perform when suffering. [Mother] I guess I stood out. 500 meters, even your heartbeat will throw you off target. Of course he picked me. No family, no future. Nothing to lose. - So, you're a headhunter. - [Adrian] Not exactly. This war's an addiction. All it creates is chaos, suffering, and people who need things. I'm just a man who can get those things. For whose side? A three-star general, an Uzbek warlord... Powerful people want things... that aren't on the menu. I should've run the other direction. So why didn't you? What else was I gonna do after the service? I was the best, and the best that I could hope for was being a cashier at a retail chain. [greeting in Arabic] [Mother] Adrian was offering more than that. [indistinct chatter in Arabic] But you didn't take it. Did a tour in Guantanamo instead. [Mother] I wasn't gonna be his employee. I waited until I had something to bring to the table. Álvarez. Eighteen months in a guard tower tends to sharpen the focus. Hector. [Mother] Hector was siphoning guns off the base under everyone's noses. Not mine. - I saw him for what he was. - And what was that? My retirement plan. Hector's guns. Adrian's network. The potential was obvious. My problem is I've got an entire armory of Hector's stolen munitions in that harbor, and I gotta make sure those weapons find a good home. [upbeat music playing] I've got the perfect home, but your repartero boyfriend is trying to raise the price you and I agreed on. Somebody's been studying their Cuban slang. I've been taking orders my whole life. And it felt good to be in control. I bet you he's a better dancer than you are. [slow Spanish song playing] It was almost too easy. Until I was pregnant. And things turned... without me seeing it. There's more money than we thought. I did good. Why is there more money? [Álvarez] This dude has very powerful friends, like you said, so sometimes they want things that are not on the menu. [Mother] They were hiding something. I had to find out for myself. [child whimpering faintly] [children coughing] And then you called us. Whose is she? If you don't mind me asking. She's not Hector's. And she's not Adrian's. She's mine. Let's go. ["Angel" by Massive Attack plays] - In position. - [Cruise] Copy. ["Angel" continues] [Mother] Four on the west side. I see them. Another two out front. Hector's moving up in the world.

Are you going to pay me back now? I have this dream... where I make you beg... and scream. Do you remember the games we used to play? There's no safe word now. We can do it for real. Hmm? I'm gonna watch you die like an animal. You don't have the balls. No? - [exclaims softly] - Try me. I'm gonna get you real turned on. Then I'm going to split you in half.

Talked to her mother. Pancakes will be on the table when we arrive. This is for Zoe. Thanks. Thanks. Thank the FBI. Cruise got it for you. You'll be okay from here. You know, they have... services and counseling and people to talk to. Where are you going? Cruise will be out soon. You should wait in the car. Are you my mother? No. [door chimes] [door closes] [Cruise] So that's it? You're just gonna vanish again, huh? She's 12. Just let her go be a kid. Let this all just be a bad memory. Hey. Stay in touch. We got about six more hours, so if you wanna take a nap, be my guest. Why won't she just admit it? What's that? That she's my mother. Zoe, let's just get you back to your real family, okay?

Now, where is your mother? Lower the gun. Get behind me. [sighs] Look at the mess you made. Do you know this man? Hmm? Who is he? Someone from child welfare? Social Services? Oh, no. Not with that standard FBI holster. - [gun fires] - [Zoe screams] - No! - Run! [Zoe panting] Zoe! Zoe! [sobbing] [sirens wailing] Here you go. [music playing faintly over speakers] When am I going home? Look, you saw what was out there. That's gonna keep coming. The feds can protect your parents, but they can't protect us. Nobody can.

I can't explain it to you at your age. You're a kid. It'll scare you. [sarcastically] Better not do that. I forgot, I... This is for you. Where are we going? Far. Go use the restroom. [keypad beeping] - Ma'am? - For the truck. [cell phone beeps] [cell phone ringing] - Hello? - I called to tell you that she's safe. - Let me talk to her, please. - She can't. - What did you say? - She can't come back to her life yet. Not yet. What does that mean? No, I... I don't understand. I don't understand any of this, so explain to me what that means. - You'll have to trust me. - Are you serious? I promise that she's just... No, he promised me you would never come back. I'm talking about Agent Cruise. They told me what happened. Did you see it happen? Yes. Did she see it too? [quietly] Yes. Hey, I need a minute. Need a minute. I can't... Hey. I will get her back to her home. Okay? Back to you. As soon as it's safe. Guess that's not a date I can put in my calendar. Her birthday's in October. - I know that. - Of course you do. Look, Cruise kept his promises, I keep mine. You'll see her blow out another candle. You have my word. - Get in. - No, where's my phone?

[sighs] Listen to me, that rabbit had a better life than any cheeseburger you ever ate. He had a beautiful life until you shot him. - I trapped him. - Much better. Let me tell you something, kid. There's nothing you ever ate that didn't come from violence. Tofu. Half of Paraguay was burned and deforested for soy plantations. Cheese. Those cows are impregnated just so they can be pulled on all day. - Gross. - Hmm. Cashew cheese. I know a mercenary in the Ivory Coast, said they fought a civil war over cashews. I wanna go home. I know you do. Eat. [Zoe sobbing] Meet me outside in five minutes. You're driving. I'm 12. So I'll teach you. Why? You wanna go home? I want that too.

I miss her and my dad, and I'm not allowed to talk to you about anything if it's not how to gut a fish or how to field dress a duck! [chuckles] I'm serious. Field dress a duck? I can't talk to you. I can't ask any questions. Zoe. The answers are tough. So? There's things in this world you don't need to know yet. What things? Please. I'm here. Whatever the question, that's your answer. And it's the only one I got. Open it. You have to practice, get the timing right. If you grip too soon, you cut yourself. Give me your arm. A knife fight means your enemy's close. You can't hit him just once. You can never stop hitting him until he can't hit back. That's how you protect yourself. You just keep hitting him again and again and again, just... You're scaring me.

A woman like that, you gotta pay attention to what she does, not what she says. And all she lives for is you. [Mother] Dear Zoe. When I left you in the hospital, it was not the end of me caring about you. Every decision I've made has been for you. The only thing that gave me any peace was knowing you were safe. I'm a killer. You know that now. But I'm also a mother, and I will die protecting you. For all my mistakes, you are the one good and beautiful thing that I have done with my life. You are a marvel. Someone tried to kill you before you were born, and you didn't just live, you flourished. When you look in the mirror, remember it's a sign that you survived. That you would not let anyone or anything erase you. I have shown you my love in the only way I know how.

[breathes deeply] [Mother grunts] [both grunting] Come on. [breathing heavily] [Adrian groans] [both breathing heavily] See where you're looking? She's just up there, isn't she? She's watching. She's got a shot, eh? Bullet in your head will take us both out. [Mother yelling] [both grunting] Did you teach her to be ruthless? Hmm? Can she stop her heart like you? We die and she survives. If that's what you want, take a breath and tell her. Tell her. Take the shot! - [gun fires] - [Mother gasps] [both grunting] [panting] Come on, please. Please come on. Please, please, please... - [screaming] - It's okay. [sobbing] Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! [groans softly] [inhales deeply] [groaning] [groans] Salt. [chuckling] [exclaiming in pain] [grunts] [breathing heavily] - [bone cracks] - [screaming] [panting] Fuck. [grunting] Fuck. [groaning] [breathing heavily] No! [sobbing] [breath trembling] [sobbing] [wincing] [Mother groans] [both sobbing] Go to your mother. I love you. [Mother] I love you too. [exhales sharply] Go. [woman] Zoe! [sobbing] Oh, look at you! I love you so much. Oh, my gosh, did you get taller?
