We, the members of Kakashi's Squad 7, were on a first C-rank escort mission in a while. We were guarding Shibuki, the young leader of Village Hidden in the Waterfall. His father was a fine man, respected by everyone, who had served as leader for many years. Those were just birds. Shut up! I know that! But this man, who had succeeded him, is so undependable. Really, how does he fulfill his duty as leader of the Hidden Waterfall Village? Wow! Look at that huge waterfall! We've arrived... So, this is the Village Hidden in the Waterfall. On a sunny day near the end of summer, we gazed out at the waterfall. At this time, we still believed that our mission would be over quickly. Mission: Protect the Waterfall Village! Master Shibuki! Huh? Welcome home! Master Shibuki! Hey, don't come close! I'm the village leader. I don't have time to play with you. You're wrong, Master Shibuki. We're going to clean up this area. Mom told us to. I see... Then we'll get you some help. From the Ninja from Hidden Leaf Village. Huh? Hey! Wait a sec--! We'll pay you! So take this on as a part of your mission. We're not handymen! You've gotta be kidd--! Thank you! That'll really help! The current's pretty strong, and it can be scary. Huh... err... Kakashi Sensei! We'll be glad to help, Shibuki. Although we'll be sending you another invoice. Hey, are we done escorting you? Yes, this is far enough. Well then, mission continues. Right. Kirisame Team reporting. We've reached Point F. Murasame Team reporting. We have reached Point P. This is Hisame Team. Have reached Point W. Roger that. Head for the target destination. What do you make of the recent rumors of suspicious activity in this area? Rumors? That Ninja from other land are targeting Village Hidden in the Waterfall? Such rumors have been around for ages. That's right, your father also battled Shinobi like that and... Don't worry. This is the Carrier Kite from Hidden Leaf Village. Oh boy... an emergency summons? You're going? Those guys can do the clean-up here by themselves. Hey guys! Sorry, but I have to go back to our village. Did something happen? It's an emergency meeting of Jonin. You can follow later. Understood. You can leave the rest to Naruto here... the one who'll inherit the Hokage's title! Well then, take care of things here. Say, what's Hokage? Hokage is the top Shinobi in the Village Hidden in the Leaf. To put it simply, he's the hero who protects the land! Hmm... Then he's just like Master Shibuki. Huh? Shibuki? Hey, don't lump Hokages together with that guy! They're in a totally different class! Don't make fun of Master Shibuki! He may be a little cowardly, but Master Shibuki is the hero of Hidden Waterfall Village! He's actually really strong! Huh?! Aghhh! Dog poop! Yuck! Who was it that pooped here?! What a loser. An embarrassment to Hidden Leaf Village! Damn! Why'd it happen to me?! Can we really sneak in from a place like this... Master Suien? Trust me... I used to be a Jonin at Hidden Waterfall Village. Let's go. Kirisame... No senseless killing. Kill only when necessary. Humph... yessir. Is attacking your homeland distasteful to you? It's not that. The only one who knows the hiding place of the Hero's Water is Shibuki, the village leader. And in order to make him talk, it's necessary to take the villagers hostage. Is that it? Hmm... I must hand it to you, Hisame. No wonder you're rumored to be the shrewdest Ninja in Hidden Rain Village. That was long ago. Like you, we are Rogue Ninja now. Whatever... let's just take over the village and get a hold of the Hero's Water! Well... Let's get the plan in motion. Sheesh... We're finished! Man, I'm starving. It's a bit early, but let's eat our lunch! No, if you're going to eat, go away! W-What?! What I mean is, if you're finished with the job, just go home! All right. We'll do that. Huh? Sasuke! Sasuke! He doesn't want the entrance to Hidden Waterfall Village to be discovered. It's probably very near. But Hidden Leaf and Hidden Waterfall are allies. So what if we know where the entrance is? Humph! Well, can you say that you'll never betray our village? You're right. Hey! What a thing to say! He's right! At least say thanks! What? Hurry and go! Hah! You don't need to tell me! We want nothing to do with a place like this! See you, Naruto! Y-Yeah! Mom! What?! Master Shibuki... it's terrible... What happened?! A-An enemy attack... Mom! Her wound isn't deep. She just lost consciousness. We have to return to the village immediately. No, that's not wise. She said enemy attack... That's ridiculous. H-How did they get to the village? Sakura, take the kids and that woman somewhere you can treat her wound. Got that? Yes. And what about you, Sasuke? Mom! Hey, Shibuki! Take us to Hidden Waterfall Village! I'll get revenge for this kid. Don't be ridiculous! What can you do anyway?! What're you doing?! Stay down! Huh?! Gotcha! Demon Wind Shuriken. Huh?! Windmill of Shadows, huh? We let him escape! Hmm... Sasuke is so cool! Master Shibuki! Huh? Master Shibuki? Huh? It's nothing. I'm just excited, that's all. Since we're involved now, we'll see this to the end. As our mission. We get to continue our mission! "Seeing a tree and not climbing isn't monkeylike." The correct proverb is, "Seeing what is right and not acting lacks courage." Oh yeah, that. Sakura, you're so smart. Our Village Hidden in the Waterfall has continued to exist thanks to the natural surroundings which form a barrier and this waterfall which hides the entrance. An entrance... in a place like this?! Let me make one thing clear... Do not tell a soul about this entrance. We know! Be careful, Naruto. That's my line! I don't sense any enemies. This way. Hurry it up! Hey Sasuke... We have no choice... All right. Now you can stop worrying. Mom...! Shizuku, don't cry. Master Shibuki will do something. Yeah. Now that will be interesting. Huh?! Sakura?! With that skill level... she's no match for me. Wow! I've never seen such a pretty place! - Strange... - Too bad. I wish Sakura could've seen this place. It's too quiet...! Huh?! What was that for?! I'll be the decoy, so you take Shibuki to safety! Hurry it up! G-Gotcha! Huh? Shibuki? Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu! Hmm... You're pretty good. I didn't sense her presence. These guys are skilled! It won't be easy like earlier. Shall I cut you into pieces? Hold on. We'll use him to negotiate. Who is this?! Humph, lucky kid. So I wonder where the village leader, Shibuki, has disappeared? Humph, it's obvious. He is probably headed to the hiding place of the Hero's Water. Hmm... I see. We'll negotiate after that? Absolutely. I must never let them have this! No matter what happens. Forget it. That's my special Murasame wire. Try Escape Justsu unwisely, and your arms will be cut off in an instant. I brought them. - Just as you ordered... the kids. - Let us out, you! Good work. Damn, what a bother! Dammit... So that's how they snuck into the village. That's... Suien?! You guided them here?! Suien! You were once this village's top Shinobi! Why are you doing this?! Do you intend to take over this village?! Hah! I have no use for a rundown village like this. I want the Hero's Water. Ridiculous! As if Master Shibuki will let you have it! He's probably disposed of it by now! A leader of the village would do that. But... I'm the one who taught him the Ninja Arts. I know him inside and out. Hey! You...how did you get here? I was wandering around the roots... and I ended up here. But never mind that. Just who are those guys? The ringleader is a former Hidden Waterfall Shinobi...named Suien. Former? Then he's a Rogue Ninja? Yeah... Hey Shibuki! I know you're hiding somewhere. Come on out! Bring the Hero's Water here. Then this village will be spared further suffering. Is that the Hero's Water that the guy's talking about? Yes. Protecting this is the duty of the leader of Hidden Waterfall Village. It's just water! This is sacred water... squeezed out of the trunk of this Sacred Tree once every 100 years. Whoever drinks this can immediately increase his Chakra several tenfold. Increase your Chakra several tenfold?! Hidden Waterfall Village has no Shinobi who has earned the title of Kage. In times of war, the villagers drank this Hero's Water and fought. During the last great war, Hidden Waterfall Village was saved thanks to this water. However, this Hero's Water was a double-edged sword. It shortened one's life by the amount of Chakra that was increased. Many of our Shinobi died not from war... but from this water. Since then, this Hero's Water was sealed away to keep it out of people's hands. And it became the duty of the leader to protect it. Several years ago, we came under attack by Shinobi from other lands.. In order to protect the village, my father drank this and fought. But... my father was not young enough to withstand the increase of Chakra. My father was a fool. He was hailed as the hero of the village... and cajoled into drinking this Hero's Water and die! Shibuki, you wouldn't throw out the Hero's Water now, would you? If there should be another war, without that, you cannot protect the village, right? I will protect the Hero's Water, as the leader of this village! If I hand it over to them, then this Village Hidden in the Waterfall will be destroyed in an instant! However... you're greatly mistaken if you think you can hide it out. If you don't hand over the Hero's Water, I'll kill the villagers here, one by one...very slowly. Don't come out, Master Shibuki! He's right! Don't give them the precious Hero's Water! Shut up, brats! Damn it! Shibuki, what're you doing?! Quiet! The kids all say... that you're really strong, Shibuki... that you're the hero of this village! They just have it in their heads... that the leader of the village is a hero! All I did was take over after my father! No! - Shizuku! - Don't! Shibuki! You should know that I'm very impatient. I'll wait one more minute. If you don't come out by then, I'll kill these kids one by one! No! If you're going to kill someone, take us first! That won't move Shibuki. He always had a soft spot for the kids. These kids will produce the best results. I don't understand it too much... But I think your pa was a great man. What?! What would you understand?! Twenty seconds left. Huh?! In order to save his village, he was willing to give his life. Not anyone can do that. Ten more seconds! What're you going to do?! Anyone who can do something like that... has to be a hero! 3...2...1! Hold it! Naruto Uzumaki is here! Don't you dare touch those kids! I'll show you! My secret technique! Huh?! W-What is it? Loser... He's as uncool as ever... You fool... trying to act like a hero, huh? I'm not acting! I'm really a hero! Humph! I don't want a wannabe hero. I want the Hero's Water. I guess I have no choice but to kill this kid! Naruto! That guy...?! Interesting... Let us see... your heroic skills. As if I'd lose to the likes of you! Kid, I wouldn't try anything foolish. This time, I will kill this kid without a fail. No! Now then, just how strong... is the hero? He's the one who was with Shibuki. If we torture him, he may tell us. As if I'd talk! What a hero you are. He's a fool! A big fool just like my old man! I won't let you die yet. As if... I'm gonna die! Damn it! Stop already! Naruto will...die! That guy... Why? Why would he endure so much for mere strangers?! In order to save his village, he was willing to give his life. Not anyone can do that. Anyone who can do something like that... has to be a hero. D-Damn it! Humph! What a foolish kid. You write it "hero" and read it "fool." Humph, yes... There's no hero! Since your father died... there's never been a hero in Village Hidden the Waterfall! Sure there is! Master Shibuki is a hero! Yes! That's right! Are you still saying that?! Master Shibuki will tear you all to shreds! All to shreds! Shibuki's not a man like that. He's a weakling and a crybaby. A coward who always runs away! No, you're wrong! You're wrong! Master Shibuki is our hero! Then you can die, hating that hero! Shibuki doesn't give a hoot about your lives! Huh?! Impossible... Do not lay a hand on the villagers! I am...your opponent! - Master Shibuki! - Master Shibuki! You did come, after all! Heh heh... not bad. You're so cool, Master Shibuki! Such powerful Chakra... To be able to see it like that with the naked eye! Water Style - Water Dragon Missile! It's been a long time, Shibuki. You haven't changed a bit. That Chakra... did you drink Hero's Water? Yes, I did. Where's the rest of it? You still have more, don't you? It's no use asking... Since I'm going to defeat you. Huh? Are you serious? Do you realize what will happen if someone of your skill level drinks Hero's Water? You, of all people, should know. Not only that, even if you drink that, your Chakra can never exceed mine! I have so much more Chakra than what is inside you. Well, I'll do what I can. Hidden Waterfall Style! Water-Cutting Blade! Your Chakra may have increased, but your strokes are the same. You're wide open. It's my win! - Master Shibuki! - Master Shibuki! Dammit...stand! I...must...protect...everyone...the kids! Hah! That's all you were. You'll always be a weak coward. It's just as I thought... I have it at last! The Hero's Water! I will be the greatest now! Give it back...! I'm just stepping on you... But did I just break your rib? Shibuki, be grateful! You will become my first prey... of this most powerful self! Unforgivable... I won't let you get away with that! I'll smash you to bits! N-Naruto... Shadow Clone Jutsu! Uzu...ma...ki! What?! He countered all my kicks?! Up to silly tricks, huh, kid?! Well, I hope you're prepared! Dammit! When did he...?! Die! Naruto! First Master Shibuki... and now Naruto! It's all over! Don't give up yet! If we give up, then it's all over. Shibuki?! Everyone will die at this rate... Take the kids and escape! Escape? No thanks. I'm gonna fight that guy! I'm overflowing with power! It's the effect of the Hero's Water... Huh? Another one? This way, Suien! Huh?! Humph, the fool! Huh?! When did...?! This tree has an opening at the top! Naruto! He still has lots of power left. I know that. So fast...! I'll kill the both of you! Humph! Just try it. Fire Style-Phoenix Flower Jutsu! Wha--?! Don't get too confident over something like that! Humph... You're the one who's too confident. What?! Anyone who drinks Hero's Water will become stronger. However, that's not true strength. The proof is...look... you're already out of breath. Huh?! Shut up! Dammit... What? Damn it! He didn't die from that?! The Hero's Water is losing its effectiveness. Well then... How's this?! No difference. What?! You're much more cowardly than Shibuki... and weak. Shibuki had courage! And the strength to try to protect the people of his village! But...you abandoned your village! And you only think of the easy way to become strong! You're the pits! I... I... I'm not scared of someone like you! Believe it! Now! Fire Style- Dragon Flame Jutsu! Huh?! The Hero's Water...! Naruto! End it with the next blow! I know that! Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu! What?! Go! Dammit! As if... I'd let this happen! Take this! You did it, Naruto. Well... yeah. Summer ended, and our mission was completed successfully. I see... so that happened? Well, well... that was rough. Sheesh... you said that with no feeling at all. Say, Shibuki, is everything all right now? Yes. Yeah, but... he drank the Hero's Water and he's fine! Shibuki is, without a doubt, the hero of Village Hidden in the Waterfall! N-No... I was always a coward. Even back then, I was overcome with fear. No such thing, Master Shibuki! Really! You were really dashing back there! Thank you. Uh-huh! Yup! Yup! Well then, shall we be on our way? Yeah... Take care! Naruto, don't step on doggie poo again! Huh? No way! The hero of Hidden Leaf Village wouldn't be that clumsy! - Yuck! - How disgusting!
