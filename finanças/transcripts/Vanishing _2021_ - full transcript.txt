I prefer what the lady makes to eat. Why isn't she here? She found another job. They all leave, all the time. Everything is ready. Let's go. That's my boss. I have to go. She never made a mistake in my medication. I liked her. It's okay, go ahead. Copy that. This is it. Professor, this is from Jakarta. A complete liver B-. We have a patient waiting for a transplant. Get ready. Are you coming from Jakarta? Yes. Passport, please. Is this a liver? Yes. Here you go. Thank you. You have beautiful hair. Yes, you do. Everything went as planned. You will receive the final payment. Honey, it's me. Everything went well. I'm going home. I love you too. Yes, hello. Detective? The forensic institute. I'll take it. Detective Park. All right, I'm coming. I'm going to see the coroner. Okay, cheer up. She died a month ago. The cause remains a mystery. All we know... is that she died under anesthesia. But the dose of anesthetic in the body does not explain the death. Were you able to identify him? No, I couldn't. After a month... the hand is too damaged to take prints. I contacted someone who can help. A scientist from Europe to participate in a conference. Alice Launey. What do they know? They don't know anything. The body is too badly damaged to be identified. What's up? The police don't know anything. They called a European professor for help. She would have invented a new identification technique. Don't worry about it. No one will trace it back to you. We'll see to it. I want to talk to your boss. You are not taking this case seriously. We warn you to be careful, not to panic like a kid. Don't talk to me like that. I'm talking nicely. The boss would talk to you differently. -Decomposition, burning, maceration, mummification, are factors to which usually solutions are needed. solutions. Potassium hydroxide or a solution based on Polyzim 606 is intended to clean a skin in an advanced stage of decomposition. But a lubricating film and disturbing the inking of the fingers can develop. That's why I have chosen a formaldehyde-based solution and isopropanol. This method associated with a mass spectrometer prevents the aging parameter. Once the calibration has been adjusted to the proportion of fractionated molecules molecules obtained, a vitrification takes place, protecting the dermis. This method is essential when we know that the quantity of DNA depends on the duration between the events and the environmental conditions. The medical examiners will therefore be able to access to fingerprints in an easier way. There you go, thanks for listening. Thank you very much, Professor Launey, for this enlighting explanation of the technique that you've developed. We will adjourn for five minute break. Professor Launey? Yes? Hello. I'm Jin-Ho Park, The detective from Seoul Police Station. Dr. Oh told me that he had asked of you. Ah Yes, I got his email. Alright. Would you be able to come to the Institute? Of course. Let me first introduce you to... Lee Mi-Sook. I am accompanying him during the conference. Can I come too? Sure. Good thing she might be Chinese, since no one reported her missing. There are many Chinese women here. Some come to get a job and send money to their families in China. Life is tough for them. They are all alone. Get ready to turn right. This way. There's Dr. Oh. Thank you so much, Professor. I heard your speach at the Los Angeles conference last year. It was really impressive. Oh, Thank you. This way. You stay here. The autopsy is confidential. Of course it is. Did you identify the victims blood type yet? B Negative. It is a rare blood type in Asia. Except in southern China. Do you think we can try your technique for this? The state of decomposition is quite advanced. Yes. I can do it. And... What's this? It looks like there was... a catheter. Yes, she was under an anesthesia. Almost ready. I'm going to need a hand. I mean, a hand from a live person. Would you mind? By all means. Put this on. Give me your hand. Don't move. Are you okay? Yes. Great. We're gonna do the next finger. You're doing really well. Thank you. Let me help you. And the last... This is very impressive. Thank you! I have to work. We know that the trace elements play a role in the endocrine system, disrupting, among other things, the metabolism of glucose. In this setting, we started a study in 2016 on the population exposure of the SKIPOGH agreements which I'm sure you've heard of. heard about. This is a cohort of three sites: Geneva, Lausanne and Bern. This was interesting in terms of geolocation. And extremely interesting since this cohort represents a rich database at the phenotypic and genotypic level. Nothing matches? No, nothing. I've got it! Call me if there's any news! What's this? It's his niece's birthday. Take an interest in him. My ass! Yoon-Ah... Look! A goldfish! Give it to me! Good morning, mom. You're late. Because I was looking for Alice. Alice? The goldfish. What kind of fish name is that? It's a French name. I just learned recently. Did you meet a Frenchman? Yes, a French woman! Mrs. Alice! Can I invite her to my birthday party? This Saturday? Will you invite him? Will you invite him, uncle? Uncle, please. You just have to tell him that I'm learning French. Okay, I promise. I promise. We put the ball here and we take a second one. Look at my hand. One, two... Again, again! Incredible, isn't it? Shall I teach you how to do it? Very good. And... Will you lend me your French book? I will. Is that it? Let's see... Perfect. Now look. The first bullet here... Hold this for a minute. Yes, anything new? We've got a hit on the prints! A Chinese woman arrived in Korea 10 months ago. We have her entry form. She came from the south of China. Entered Korea at Pyeongtaek. Wait, wait, wait... What's that? The name of the employer she gave when she arrived. The Dream Agency. You are lucky. It's so beautiful, Paris. No, I've never been there. -You haven't? But why did you learn French? I came from a respectable family. So it was important for me to speak in a European language. My husband liked it. At the time, when we got married, he was full of ambition. I thought he was so brave. He came from a very modest family. He had to fight to get an education. And he was so handsome. What's that? Is that blood types? Here, it's like your astrological signs. The blood type influences on your personality. I am O. What do they say about the O's? That they are ambitious, and have confidence in themselves. Sometimes too much. Why is it taking so long? That's it! His phone number. 92531163. Do you have anything else on her? Why would I have more? The client calls me, we set a date and I send him a cleaning lady. We've always done it this way. Do you recognize it? I see so many, you know. She doesn't tell me anything. I'm sure she wasn't a stowaway! If she was illegal, we wouldn't It's been a month... Why didn't you report her disappearance? I didn't know. I didn't know that she was missing! She didn't show up again, that's all! It happens often, this kind of thing. Chinese women, you know, really... You're going off the rails! We're talking about a dead woman here! That's it. I heard something. It was outside, Mi-Sook. Go back to sleep. I'm going to check! No, I'll go. What's up? What's up? Tell them you're quitting. I told you, it's impossible. Then we have to give up everything. We have to go abroad. We can't change our life. To do what? Night watchman and cleaning lady? I'm ready to do anything. No. I'd rather die. Rather than ruin everything. Hello, Alice, it's Martin. Thank you for the comments on my student's intervention. We need to talk about about the next school year. Would you call me back? Message deleted. New message, received today at 14:01. Honey, it's Mommy. I got Mrs. Clibourgh on the phone about her nephew's internship. Message deleted. New message, received today at 18:45. Alice, it's Martin again. I don't want to harass you, but I need to know what you're planning for next year. Do you still want to teach? A management position is opening up, you are my ideal candidate, But you have to be interested. I learned that you were in Seoul. You're going further and further away, aren't you? Well, it would be nice to talk to you. I hope you're doing well. See you soon. End of messages. Main menu. To consult your messages... - "Cautious, patient and considerate." So: cautious, patient and considerate. "You are an introvert and a perfectionist by nature. introvert and perfectionist." That's not bad, group A. Here you go. Hello? Hello, Mi-Sook? Sorry to call you so early. Hello, professor. No worries, I was up. I need your help. Choose a ball. All right, keep it. Detective Park. I need to talk to you. It's about the murder case. Okay. Please come this way. We thought that the wound on the arm was from an injection. What if it was something else? A transfusion. to transfuse blood to someone of type B- to keep him alive as long as possible. So there might be a second corpse. We should go back to where we found the girl. And we expand the perimeter. Yes, Detective! Professor, your workshop starts in 30 minutes. Yes, of course. You shouldn't look at it that way. from this point of view. DNA tracing changes our view of things. It is on the basis of sequencing that we have to start again. -What do you think, colleagues? Excuse me a moment. She died a month ago, just like the first one. And she was pregnant. She was also under anesthesia as well. Before her death, Take her liver out. And the placenta. Oh My God. The edges of the wound are well defined. The organ removal was done right By a surgeon. How many months pregnant was she? Six months. Around six months of pregnancy, the placenta is at its highest embryonic stem cell production. It makes a real valuable organ. B negative? Yes. The first woman was used as a blood bag to transfuse this one with blood, while they were taking this one's placenta out. Stem cells can be used to regenerate to other organs like... Heart, ans kidneys... It implies that surgeon was not probably equipped for blood transfusion, and had no resuscitation unit. Organ trafficking. Okay, shall we? Okay, let's do it. Yes, Detective? I got the prints. Run the identification and keep me posted. Sure thing. Beer? Hold on... I'll show you magic. Magic? Empty. No! Magic! Is it gone? A second one. A second one... No! That's not possible. This is for my niece, Yoon-Ah. Her birthday is coming up soon. She will love it a lot. Yoon-Ah. She is learning French after school. Her parents traveled to Europe for their honeymoon. And loved France very much. Since then, all she talks about is going to Paris. Wait a minute. Hello, Ms. Teacher. My name is Yoon-Ah. I invite you to come on my birthday. See you on Saturday. She'll be very happy if you could come. That's very kind. I will try. Thank you. Thank you so much. So where we off to? My favorite place in Seoul. Don't worry, We're not making a big detour. Oh No, I'm not worried. Get ready to turn right. Recalculate the route. In 150 meters, turn left. So why do you leave the GPS on if you don't listen to it? Because I'm better than than this thing. Are you are trying to beat the GPS? Yes. Does it work? can you beat it? Sometimes. May I ask you a personal question? a personal question? Sure. Do you have a child No. No child. No husband either. I guess I scared them away. Perhaps because of my job. How did you start this job? It's a very long story. I'm quite sad actually. A few years ago, I operated on a child. There were some complications. I couldn't save him. After that, I started to be too afraid when I was operating. It was better that I don't take care of living people anymore. I'm telling you all this, but it must not be easy to understand. You had a issue with a child. Detective... - Any luck with the prints? - Not yet. But I got the list of the transplanted livers. Only one could have come from from the pregnant girl. The transplant was done at Seoul University Hospital. But according to Customs files, it came from Indonesia, not Korea. This is not the one that matches from this girl. Will you still call the UHC? I already did. They checked the international transplant file, which confirms that this is the liver of a woman who is 6 months pregnant. who killed herself in Jakarta. There is no way that this is her. Okay, I'm on my way. Any news? Not at all. Well, I... I guess you have to go back to work? Yes. I guess that's the end of the romantic route. Maybe... next time. Yeah. So... Will you come to Yoon-Ah's birthday party? Yes. Good night. Have a nice ride home. Good evening, Alice. Mi-Sook? What are you doing here? It's my job, and then I was worried. For me? No, let's see. I was in town with Commissioner Park. How is his investigation going? A second woman was found in connection with the first one. And do we know who she is? Poor woman. Good night. Mi-Sook ? I was wondering, here in Korea, you don't express your feelings easily, do you? -That's because here, we take love very seriously. Good night. Stock market or life! Woah, woah, woah, woah! My money or my life? Well i'm dead broke, Cowboy. What do we do? Well/ Then your life! Mommy, mommy! What's wrong, honey? It's Dad. I shot him. I didn't mean to. It's okay. Seems like there's only one thing we can do. We have to say the magic word. Remember? It works! One more time. Yes! It worked! Looks like there's a magician here. Let's see what kind of magic he can do, huh? Hello. It's time to get ready. Yes. Very good. It will be the day after tomorrow. We'll be ready. Let us know... We'll get back to you. They have a placenta, B-. They should be able to operate on him. Glad they came, we're going to be okay. Okay, great. So... Come and see. You take line 9 to Shinbanghwa station. He will be waiting for you at the exit of the subway. How do I... How will I recognize him? You don't have to recognize him! He'll recognize you. Come on! Get out of the way! Hurry up! This is your new cleaning lady. Hello, madam. I'm warning you... My mother has a weak heart. She had a heart transplant a few years ago. You really have to be be careful with her. Do you understand? Yes, I understand, sir. Everything is ready for the next operation. Perfect, let's go, but this time, no errors. I don't want any more problems. How's the mama's boy doing? He was not good.

Just a scratch. We said never a scratch. We need them intact. It's intact, no problem. She sleeps like a baby. Did you have an accident? I was blocked by a truck, I had to get out of the way. Did the police spot you? Of course not. Henry? Are you ready? Let's bring some toy. I'll see you at the hospital. Yes, hello. Yes, hold on. Placenta stem cells will not be enough! We absolutely need a heart! The plan has changed. What do you mean? Forget about the placenta. We need a heart. It can't be done. You can't transplant an adult heart into a kid! You are completely crazy. Shut up! She was going to die anyway. We need a heart. You'll find it. I have to go home. An emergency. Do you need me? No, go ahead. I'll pick you up tomorrow for the birthday party. See you tomorrow. Detective? Come and see! A kidnapping has been reported, possibly related to our case.
