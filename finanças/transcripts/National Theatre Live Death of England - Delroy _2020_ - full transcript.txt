It was the punch in Punch and Judy, the real in surreal. I mean, like, I didn't know, understand, get how twisted, corked, mashup life can be already. They were gonna take my dignity, too. My dignity, man! Yeah, yeah, I weren't gonna let him know that. I weren't gonna give him, them the pleasure. Though to be fair... ...he... he was nice, yeah. Well, as you can be, in the circumstances, considering. I mean like, he could never have known the size of the crater on my heart. I mean, he had as shit a job as mine, I guess. So, so, so maybe I should just enjoy the fact I had a white man doing a Kaepernick. I am guessing that everyone knows what I'm on about? Colin Kaepernick. You'd have to be the biggest tosser in the world not to know, right? Huh? You'd have to have your head so stuck up your privilege not to know. You would need Nelson Mandela to rise from the dead and twerk, naked on the finish line at Ascot to actually see that Black people exist. So, so, so he's kneeling there, yeah, in front of me. Yeah? And he's telling me, showing me, explaining how I'm gonna have to manage this shit. And even though it's killing me, all I can think of is her. Her! Her. Who is she? Where is she? Is she OK? But I have to engage, but I keep drifting off, thinking about her. Wanting to hold her, to smell her. Then he says the word 'breach'. 'You... You... You'll be in breach.' My mind wip pans to his will. I'll... I'll breach? 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that can lead to... Well, it's like you're fucked! 'They could bang you up for that.' I nodded, like a schoolboy being a chastised by his headmaster. He could see my ego sliding off under the door. And in an attempt to lighten the mood, he then asked... 'What do you do?' Now... I paused to try and work out if he was the right kind of person to tell. Noticing my reticence, he looked down to my ankle, clicked it in place thoughtfully and then asked, 'All right, all right. Er... What's the funniest thing about your job?' And I just go into one. Must have been the nerves, the anger, the shame. Yeah. Yeah! The shame! The utter shame of it all. 'The surprise!' I said, as he stood up and plugged it into the wall. 'The surprise, yeah. I think some people think they're kind of untouchable. 'They're not untouchable, just that it won't go that wrong for them 'until we bailiffs turn up and rattle their cage! 'Yeah, bruv, we bailiffs turn up and shatter that shit good. 'Yes! The look on their faces! 'It's like all their facial muscles just give up, 'like some 100-year-old man's scrotum, 'all lifeless and southbound.' He goes over to his bag and starts packing his stuff up, but still keeping eye contact with me, like he's fully engaged, interested, when he must've been dying for me to shut the fuck up. 'Every time the same shit, like it's some kind of surprise. They haven't paid! 'The rent, the mortgage or whatever. 'They haven't paid! So where's the fucking surprise? It cracks me up. Here's the rub. 'If there are no evictions, I don't get paid. 'And if I don't get paid, I'm not a good member of society, right? 'That's capitalism, ain't it? Or consumerism, one of the two. 'Someone has to pay in order for me to live rich. That's British values, no? 'We're in it together!' Then I start telling him about Michael. 'We're in it together. That's what Michael gives it. "We're in it together, Delroy." 'He says, white guy. Yeah, I've known him since school. 'My best friend, to be honest. But it's been on the ropes, the friendship. 'He mugged me right off a while back and well, 'they hate the fact that I do this job, it goes against... I dunno, really, but...' 'Whoa! It takes about a hour and half to charge. 'You can use the portable one if you don't want to stand there with it.' He says without taking a breath, in case I start popping off again. But now, I'm on a roll. 'And my daughter! Born now. I haven't even seen her. 'They've made no effort to make things right.' It came like vomit from deep inside of me, unannounced and visceral as fuck. 'No effort! None of them! They didn't even come to court!' 'Er... I-I gotta go, mate.' His knitted brow making it clear he had the arse with me now. 'Er, remember, if it bleeps you are in breach. 'So keep it charged, right?' I nodded again, like the schoolboy from before. 'Er, charge it every day. Right.' And with that he was gone, like some CIA operative. I mean, all he needed was a plume of smoke and I would have thought I'd imagined it. And then I looked down at it. My tag, my fucking tag and laughed. [♪ 'Cornerstone' by Benjamin Clementine'] ♪ I'm alone In a box of stone ♪ When all is said And done... ♪ – – Fuck off, man! To be honest, though, I didn't gave a fuck who it was we evicted. Black. White. Indian. Chinese. European. Though, er... that's still white, though, right? You see, sometimes, I found that shit funny, too. Whites hating whites cos they've got a different accent. Funny, bwoy! When they know, unlike us Blacks, if they breed here, their kids are considered more English then me, who's got generations of Britishness. But that's being British, though, innit? Well, that's what works for most of us, apart from that lot, the kumbaya lot, who just love to march while singing and partying. Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Thinking they're gonna make changes. Jokers! Fucking rug! Yeah. Fuck that! I'm staying right here! Yeah, earn my corn, get a nice car, lickle flat. Big flat-screen TV and I'm set. Fuck that! Fuck them! Fuck Michael, Carly, all of them. Island mentality, innit? All that European shit, it doesn't connect with me, man. As long as my taxes ain't too high, why should I care? Huh? No one... No one... No one cares about me. Nah. Ain't no European Union questioning police stop and search figures on Black people here. Checking up on our Black deaths in custody, Black mental health figures. Ain't no European law on that, is there? He's cussing me out at his dad's funeral for voting Brexit. 'We're in it together.' – – Look at this fucking tag! In it together? I'm just doing as British do, innit? Looking out for my own. Cos I'm as European is a dim fucking sum. I'll tell you what, though. If I hadn't lost my job, I'd be busy like rass now, though. Everybody bruc! Coulda mad some Ps, mate. Everybody bruc like, oh, what's his name? Did the Spike Lee films back in the day. Thought tax was beneath him, or something. Come on, all you cultured folk. Spike Lee films? Thought tax was beneath him? Someone? – Wesley Snipes. – Who said that? You're a bad bwoy! – – Wesley Snipes. See, a lot of people that thought their shit didn't stink are gonna be feeling it now, yeah! Yeah, I'm still gonna have to bail out Carly, I bet. Yeah, all that shit she said to me. That's all gonna be forgotten. All water under the bridge. Yeah, yeah, all big-time sorries, yeah, because she needs me. Well, she can go fuck herself! Leaving me on me tod. Couldn't even come to court, man. But she's getting through. I hear, yeah, yeah, yeah. Whole new her, her mum tells me. Changed for ever. But she's got family helping her get through. And I've got Guinness Original Extra Stout, dark and lively. Don't worry. Look, I don't expect you to be on my side. Yeah? Bailiffs don't engender much sympathy. And a Black one? Well, that's a Black Lives Matter march too many! Just fucking off-key, right? - – But Carly. Oh, man! She's a... - – She's... She's... She's... She's a trip. Yeah, she's my, er... Well, I'm not sure any more. It's complicated. It's always been complicated, right from the off. She's my best friend's sister. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Michael's sister? Carly Fletcher? Their dad was Alan Fletcher with the twist-up lips. Used to own the Fletcher flower stall on Hermit Road? Died a couple of years ago? Well, let me tell you about Carly first, yeah? But they should all come with a government health warning, and are highly addictive and, it must be said, a good craic! But she... She's... I don't know. It's chemistry, innit? Some people, it don't matter what they look like, know what I mean? You know what I mean. Look, no offence, yeah? But... Well, look. It's like they make you want to go deep sea diving, yeah? Where breathing ain't easy and you very well may drown but you can't help but want to dive in again and again and again. You feel me? – [♪ Theme to 'Test Match Special'] – My mum... [CHUCKLES] My mum can't stand the girl. Well, that's not entirely true. You see, it wasn't that she didn't like white people. She was a care attendant! A care attendant? In the current climate? Yeah? Come on! Fucking hell! She worked with loads, looked after loads and loads of her mates were white. But I think... I think she wanted me to have a Black girlfriend. Like her, I guess. I think she just thought, after all the years of pain we suffer from them, all the mistreatment, the disrespect, all the centuries of colonialism, that I should want to date someone that understood that. You know? That got it, that knew it, that felt it. And, bwoy, did she let me know it?! Her?' 'Yes.' 'Her?' she said, sipping on the Wray & Nephew for fuel. 'Yes, Mum!' 'But she can't cook jerk chicken.' She slammed that one down like a winning domino. 'She can't cook pasta!' 'Fried dumpling? Ackee and salt-fish? Plantain? My Jamaican patties?' 'Mum, this isn't MasterChef, you know!' 'All the pretty Black girls out there and you want a...?' 'I like her!' I pleaded weakly. 'And you want a white gal?' 'No, Mum. I don't just want a white gal.' 'You want her?' 'Yes. Yes, I do.' 'Her daddy is a...' 'I know.' She then leaned over me so close her 9-carat gold Nefertiti head around her neck tapped me on the forehead... ...annoyingly. '..A racist!' It landed like a stink bomb staining the whole room. 'I know!' 'So what di 'ell you playing at?' 'I like her.' 'She's not gonna know why you don't like your hair being touched.' 'I could tell her! Look, Mum, I get ya. 'I like her. She's mouthy and messy.' 'And arrogant.' 'Yeah. But she's trying to be better.' 'Really?' 'Yeah. And she's funny, makes me laugh, and so curious about stuff. I don't know. 'We're not getting married, we're not having kids! We're just dating.' 'Her daddy know?' 'No.' She kissed her teeth so loudly I thought the glass she was holding might smash. I knew she was right. What the fuck was I playing at? I was selling out. I was being a coconut. I was... But I liked her kisser! First time we kissed... No, no. It wasn't romantic, no, not in a normal way. But, well, I do remember it fondly, yeah. Let me tell you, yeah? I was walking home from school. Yeah? I just got off the 58, yeah? I was about to step to turn down Regis Road and there she was. Now, she'd clearly bunked off the last period or something because she'd ditched our school uniform and was now sporting one of those grey, low-slung jogging hug-me-batty-tight pants! Yeah, you know them, right? And a Lycra sports top that if she wasn't 15, she'd only get away with on a nudist beach. So, she comes up to me, all bossy with her white gal, road gal stance and says. 'I hear once you've had a Black you never look back.' Now, I know that was a pretty shit thing to say and my heart rate and my pulse rate made damn sure to me that I didn't like it, too. So I lean my head slightly, screwed up my face like I'd smelled something rough, and I was just about to fling some lyrics in her head, when I felt her hand resting softly on my inner thigh. I then registered her pupils enlarge in her green eyes like my house cat on heat. Now, I was 15, so touching me there was like pressing the button on Jack-in-the-box. Actually, to be honest, you only had to be was a girl with a pulse to climb my summit, in those days, with my heart rate competing with Goldie for beats per minute already. By the time she leaned in to kiss me... ...I'd forgotten what she'd said! 'I had to get your attention, somehow, didn't I? I didn't mean anything by it.' She said, coming up for air, with her little finger on the edge of my Calvin Klein boxers. No, no. There were no tongues involved. Just tender young lips pressing together. Blissful, mate. I've been hooked ever since. I know it's a bit Stockholm syndrome, but what can I say. It comes to something, innit, when your own mother ain't even on your side. Not that I was expecting much from her anyhow, considering she loved to give me the arsehole day and night about what I did for a living. Like it was my fault some people couldn't to pay their bills or get out of debt. My mum has never been in debt. She never had a credit card till she was, um... 33. Yeah, see our family were bruc, like most families are, but we were never poor, see – Mum made sure of that. Never was there a day when there was no food on the table. So, if Mum could handle her finances, why can't others? When I wanted the bike that Michael had when we were kids, if she couldn't afford it, it was no, end of discussion. Make more of it, you get a slap round your head for your troubles. My mum's slaps were premium, I no lie! So, even though we'd disagree, I'd still see where she is coming from. So, why was it so hard for her to do the same for me? To understand it from my point of view? She's my mum, right? They're meant to understand yer, no? See, it hurts when they don't, she's cut me a few times, but when she sided with them over me... Well, no. It wasn't actually sided. She just kinda... She just kinda mugged me off, in front of people, too. This is how it went down, yeah? Jog on, you muppet! I just come from a job. Some mug fucked it right up for himself by not paying his tax. Yeah, I got that a lot, like they're exempt. No sympathy from me, nada! So we got all that shit ready to go, laptop, fridge, flatscreen, all loaded up, when I turn on my phone. I don't like to have it on when I'm working. Well, actually I was cool about it, it's just that I had a new boy working for me whose parents had the nerve to call him Elvis! Imagine! Moroccan fella, too. Bet he loved that, right? 'Cheers, Mum, blinding, Dad. Thanks for calling me Elvis. '11 years of bullying at school right there. Uh-huh! Uh-huh!' Anyhow, I like to give it time with them, you know? 'Do as I say. Watch and learn. Phones off when you're working!' I take my time, and as soon as I start to I feel the love, I relax the rules a bit. Yeah? Anyhow, the van is loaded up. We are en route to our next gig. Elvis is driving, doing as he's told. So, fuck it, I thought! I turn on my phone. 19 voice mails! 18 from Carly's mum giving me the arsehole, wanting to know where I am. So I call her straight back. 'Where the fuck have you been?' 'Eh?' I said, wishing I hadn't put in on loud speaker. 'What you got a bloody mobile for if you ain't gonna use it?' Elvis turns his face to the side but I could see his cheeks bulging with laughter. 'Er... Mrs Fletcher.' 'I told you not to call me that!' 'Sorry, Maggie. What is it? Is Carly OK?' 'Haven't you heard your messages?' 'I called you back I saw your calls.' 'Which you didn't answer.' I don't know how words were getting through her jaw was so tight. 'How about you telling me why it is you're calling?' I said, having lost all authority with Elvis and patience with her. 'Her waters! Her waters have broken.' 'Whoa, wait. It's January. We're only in January.' 'Great. Do you know your ten times table, too?' Elvis burst out laughing, spitting his drink all over himself. Grabbing the phone, turning off loudspeaker I placed it to my ear. 'W-where is she?' 'If you can, we'll meet you at the hospital.' Now, I know she's never had any real love for me, Carly's mum, for obvious reasons, the main one being my skin, though, but 'if you can'? If I can? This is my kid Carly is having, and her mum's bringing out 'if you can'! I mean, what de rass? That woman facety man! I turn to Elvis, trying hard not to push his face through the windscreen out of embarrassment and tell him to 'Drop me off at the nearest Tube, quick!' I jump out, nearly getting run over during the process, and that was it. Me jumping out of the van was the beginning of a very bad day for me. I just didn't know it, but in about four minutes, I was going to know it, fer trut. So I got out my Oyster card, glide myself through the barriers and start getting a serious jog on for the escalators when I realised this is the Overground – it's the Underground I want. I can hear Carly screaming in me head. 'You can't even hold me hand on time. 'All I needed was for you to hold me hand and you couldn't even do that.' The orange of the Overground sign scorched my eyes. The Overground takes too blasted long! Four stops on the Underground to the hospital. 'OK, ' I thought, 'I've got time.' As soon as I hit the bottom of the escalator, I sharply used the up side ones to take myself back up. Now, considering my panic levels were at maximum, I was still holding down some street swagger. Only one bead of sweat perhaps and I was fit so I wasn't breathing that heavily. I was still smooth. That's when it happened, when shit got real. Without warning, and I mean without a single bit, I felt a heap of hands grabbing me from behind, slamming my face against the side of the wall and holding it there as the escalator went up. As I went up, that shit hurt, so I goes, 'What the fuck, man? What the actual fuck?' That's when I started to sweat big time. Some brer with the stinkiest breath ever, whispers right in my ear. 'Don't move. Keep your mouth shut.' Straight off, I knew this weren't no mugging, or a bunch of white trash lads that fancy a ruck with a brudda, because they've got it in their minds it was White Boy Day or something. I was scared because I knew whoever these guys were, they were hardcore! 'Why d'ya go back up the escalators?' He said. Like he didn't need an answer. 'Why's it any of your mother-fucking business?' My eyes bulging with indignation. 'Clocked us, did yer?' 'What?' 'Tried to make a dash for it?' He offered, pressing harder into my back with his massive forearm. 'Clock who? Who the living rass are yer?' As soon as we got to the top, I managed to get a look around to see who it was. One of them was flashing his warrant card at me. It was the Old Bill, the fucking police. It was the Babylon troubling me. I should have known. What is this? Did someone take me back in time to the '90s or something? Not one, but three of them for me, yeah? Three! I mean, what the fuck is this? So, I ask them. 'What the fuck is this?' What is it about three large white men, yeah, holding you against your will... ...against a wall, that makes you realise how small you are? Yeah? How... How insignificant you are. 'Shut yer mouth!' One of them snarls. His bad breath swirling its way up my nostrils like smoke. 'I just want to know what this is, man.' 'ID?' he bellows, as his spit sprayed across my now blistering hot face. I don't know why he asked really, because his hands had already emptied my pockets with force. 'You don't understand! I got to be somewhere! I've got to get to the...' 'Shut up! OK? Shut it!' 'While we check your ID.' He said, our heads now touching. 'You got the wrong brer.' 'For what?' My mouth now wide open with shock. 'What have we got wrong about you?' Now, I've been black enough all my life to know that this... this is a fit-up! Some profiling thing. Obviously, they're on the hunt for somebody, and it happens to be my unlucky day that I fit whoever this fucker is they're looking for, down to a tee – I.e. black skin. Normally, I'd understand. I'd be able to just flex this shit off but this ain't no normal day. This is the day I become a dad. I ain't got time for it. I got to get to the... Well, they needed clarity, innit. So, as clearly as I can, I tell them to, 'Get the fuck off me, yeah? I ain't done nothing!' Big mistake. The copper with the rank smelling breath leans in my face again, while two of his finest hold me down tight, in some mash up, Judo got-you-nigger-boy I-can't-breath move. 'Swear at me one more time, and you are coming with us.' As I continue to remember that day, that line from PC Stink Breath still don't make no sense to me. I couldn't help it! So there I was, I felt like I was 15 again, when I first got tugged by the beast. Triggered to fuck I was, all humiliated, scared and angry. 'Coming with us? 'It look like you had that on your mind from the beginning, 'but you've got the wrong brer. 'You are holding me up, so if you could be so kind 'and tell me what this is, so I can go about my business?' Nothing back from them. 'Oh, for fuck's sakes.' ..for fuck's sakes... I said to myself. I know. He warned me loud as clear. I couldn't help the fuck from coming out, but my panic level was at an all-time high! 'Right, that's it!' he said with the petulance of John McEnroe. Then he goes to grab me, but I just lift my hands. And then he... Well, I don't quite know, really, just kind of slipped. I mean, that's why I started to laugh cos it was so, like... Well, he just lost his cool and... Brrrrrang-a-dang-dang-dang... la-la-la... dang-dang-dang-boom-boom-boom pllllffff! He fell like a bag of shopping down the escalators, all messy and unrehearsed. I couldn't help but laugh! Call it gallows humour. Call it karma. Fuck, call it what you like, shit was funny for real, bredren. Next minute they're marching me out the station. Should I make a dash for it? No chance, they got me tight. Whoever this fucking brudda is they got me mistaken for, must have done something hardcore! I felt shame, bwoy. People staring at me hard. It felt like I'd been sent off at Wembley for breaking Harry Kane's fibula during the World Cup final. My stress levels were now about 11 out of 10. I weren't swearing now, though. I weren't giving it large. But I was saying, 'My girl's waters have broken! 'Carly's waters have broken.' Every chance I got. 'She's about to drop at any minute. Don't you care? 'Don't you realise how shamed you're gonna be, when you realise you fu... messed up? 'I'm not your man!' Nothing back from them. Not a word, like I was talking to one of them guards outside Buckingham Palace. And then, to make things worse, when we get to the station, I got their custody sergeant staring down at me. And guess what, he's only a brudda! You could not make it up! You see, white coppers are one thing, especially the working-class variety, nothing but a bunch of 'good ole boys' in uniform. But a brudda with stripes on his sleeves? They're the worst. They know they gotta overcompensate. Can't be too black for their colleagues, so you know they're gonna go all white east London on us. 'Name?' I give it to him, in between telling him about Carly. 'Brudda, brudda, brudda, please. I gotta be somewhere. I gotta get to the...' He doesn't want to know. 'Date of birth.' Fuck it, I'll give it to him. What else could I do? But then he had to say it. He had to ask that question. He had to go there. 'Previous convictions?' 'What?' 'What have you done in the past?' I didn't need to ask, I know what I heard, from this coconut! 'How can you ask me a question like that? 'You been kissing the white man's arse so long, you starting to like it, brudda?' 'Previous convictions?' 'I have no previous convictions! 'As I keep telling you people, you have made a rhatid fucking mistake!' I managed to get that in, for as long as it took them to fling me in one of their cells. All I could think about was Carly. And that she could drop at any second my kid, and I was in here. Am I cursed? Was Zeus looking down at me from Mount Olympus, going, 'Oi, Apollo, come 'ere. I'm done with shagging Aphrodite. 'Let's fuck with Delroy today, I'm bored!' Cos it bloody felt like he was. I don't know if he knew, Zeus that is, cos I bleeding well didn't know, how I'd take to be in here. In a cell. Mate... A-as soon as he turned the lock... No, no, no. Actually, it was when he walked away... ...I felt like, like I'd been hollowed out. Like all the things that were holding me together mentally just evaporated. I started to sweat in my palms and my armpits, not my face. Just my hands and my arms started seeping sweat. I don't know if it was the claustrophobia or that I was missing Carly giving birth or the fact that finally they got me, the feds. Finally, I was just a number. Finally, I was another Black man that got fucked by the police. Finally, I was another hapless victim to this class-colour bullshit! I, me, was on this conveyer belt of hate. I don't know, I felt shame and rage and fear. Because I knew what these people were capable of. Was I gonna be another story? Was this it? Me, dead, finished? See, it weren't no don't-pick-up-the-soap kind of fear. It was because... It was because... I didn't know if I could make it. If I was bad enough. Yeah. Strong enough, rough enough to be held like a slave, like an animal in a cage, fucking caged, me! Fucking me! All right, I'm a bailiff! I take people's things away, but it's legal, it's a job, it's my job. Someone's got to do it. I pay my taxes. I abide by the law. I have never committed a crime in my life. I voted for Boris, twice. And I don't care that it's fucked up. What, is that not allowed? Am I to be told what I can and cannot do and who I'm supposed to be in my own country? NO! And then the tears started coming and I thought already I'd fucked it as a dad. Already, I was the kind of dad that my kid would have to not want to be like or be ashamed of. Was I suddenly unemployable? Undesirable? Unsuccessful? I picked up the paper-thin, spunk-riddled mattress. And leaned it against the wall. And I pounded it. I pounded the shit out of it! Over and over and over and over again. Tears making welts in my face. 'If you don't stop that shit now boy, we'll fucking make you!' Boy? Boy? I bought my own flat three years ago. I've got a mortgage and two house cats to feed. But still, in the eyes of some, I am nothing but a boy. I turned to him and I... And I buckled. Like a three-year-old standing in the middle of a road staring at a bus hurtling towards it. I buckled and I sat and I cried out all the man tears I'd held over the years. All the shit I'd buried. Cried out all the anger I'd hidden, all the hope I'd managed, all the pride I'd held in remission. I wept it out. I cried and cried and cried and cried. Four hours, straight. The whole time I was in there for. Like a... Like a baby. And then, suddenly, the cell door opened and they chucked me out. Do I get an apology? Do I fuck! Just a, 'Well... 'We may be pressing charges, pending further investigation. 'But for now, on your way.' Yeah. Fingerprints and photos, and blah, blah, blah, blah. Now, normally, I would have loved to have stayed and chat, and take great delight in telling them about themselves. But needs must, tears wiped, I had a hospital to get to. Carly's probably dropped it, I thought. Actually, I wasn't thinking, I was bloody panicking. When I got out I clocked my battery was dead, so I couldn't phone anyone. So, I don't know if a record exists... ...for the fastest time to get from the local nick to the hospital, but if there was one, I broke it. In your face, Usain! As soon as I arrived at the hospital, I saw my mum sitting there in a chair giving me the look. Nothing I could say would be good enough for sure. We were never gonna be in accord, no matter fucking what. I could have rolled in with no legs and she would have still looked at me the same way. Mums, man! But what I also knew right then was that Carly hadn't dropped it yet. You think my mum would be have been sat there all calm and serene if Carly had given birth to her first grandchild? No! She'd have been in there, fighting with Carly's mum over whose turn it was to hold the sprog. Anyway, I told her as we went up in the lift. And after being dragged around a police station like a refugee out of Italian waters, I was expecting a little bit of tea and sympathy from me mum. But all she had for me, was... 'It's your fault!' 'Say that again.' 'Your fault.' You should have seen my mouth, it was all this. 'Sorry, Mum, can you give that to me again? How was any of that, my fault?' Then, without skipping a beat, she laid it on for me. "It's your fault, Delroy, right from the beginning "because you gave them what them want, another mouthy Black man. 'You can't beat those people, not like that. You play them, bwoy. 'You play them at them own game. 'I taught you better than that. You know better than that. 'You kill them with kindness. You don't say a word. 'Don't give them what them want. 'You never done nothing wrong, so it is all 'pon them. 'You can't beat them by going all loud. 'If you think you can, you're nothing but a wurtless fool 'and I never raised no fool, so don't go making a liar for me, understand? 'Use your head, bwoy!' Mums! I bloody hate them, especially, when they're right. Cos when I ran down the corridor and raced onto the ward Carly was in, and slipped into a gown quicker then a Tyson Fury left hook, and dived into Carly's room, I was told in no uncertain terms to... 'Fuuuuck off!' 'You miserable no-watch wanker!' By my loving, darling mid-contracting girlfriend Carly. 'How the fuck can you be late now? 'You can't even hold me hand on time. 'All I needed was for you to hold me hand and you couldn't even do that.' Yeah. I had guessed near enough exactly what she would say. But I never would have guessed what she went on to say. 'Get the fuck out of here! 'I don't want to... hear no excuses and explanations.' Her face contorted with the pain of childbirth and anger. 'I don't wanna hear no "You don't understand" rubbish, ' she squeezed through her tight, tense jaw. 'No "black people got it rough!" Sick to death of it. 'You an and your "it's different for us" bullshit, Delroy. 'All your "walk in my shoes" shit or should I say trainers? 'One of your 50 pairs of trainers you wear 'like giving multi-national, imperialist, racist corporations money makes you Black!' Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. She well and truly dug me with that one, while wiping her grease and sweat-soaked hair from her eyes. 'You and your "white privilege" wank. Get the fuck out, Delroy. You let me down!' Her words wrapping around me like a hair shirt. 'I'll do this on me own, you hear me? Like I knew I would when I got pregnant. 'When we got together. You're just the same as all of them! 'Grow up, Delroy! Grow the fuck up, will ya? 'We're not in South Africa, bruv. We're in Hackney! 'It ain't that fucking hard! Now get out! Out!' I just stood there, knowing I couldn't tell her the rest now about what happened. Along with, um... Er... what di rass? What the fuck did she just say to me, with my child in her belly? I just backed away, with the nurses giving me dead eye. Slamming my back into the double doors, I exited. Broken to the core. Have you ever seen a Black guy go red? Hm? Nah, I didn't think it was possible, either. Until I saw my face in the mirrors when I went to hide in the loos. The shame had managed to bring blood so vehemently to the front of my face it was peaking through my pores like beetroot and chocolate cake. 'I'm not in South Africa? Fucking hell!' I thought, after all the hours going to antenatal with this bitch! The only man there, you know. All of them looking at me like I must have been her Uber driver or something. I thought after all the back-rubbing, and the scraping and the fetching and the hugging and the supporting... After all the decorating and managing and hoping and wishing... After all the cooking and cleaning and not drinking – I hadn't had a fucking drink in six months and this is what she's gonna say to me while giving birth to my child? Fucking hell. English people. Doesn't she think how that makes me feel? I know I'm not in South Africa but the point is if I was I'd be fucked! Just like them, so I feel it, cos we share that knowledge. Doesn't she realise how small that makes me grow as a man? Knowing an American white man can shoot dead someone that looks like me out of hate and get away with it? English people. Even when you worship the ground they tread they can still say shit like that and still not see you. She said I was like 'all of them'. What the fuck was that supposed to mean? All of who? What kind of narrow-minded bullshit was that? But in truth, I knew what she meant. I mean, I know she phrased it terribly, but I knew what she meant. And the fact was, having just left the police station, I was now this racists' picture of a Black man. That was the fact and nothing could shake that. But that ain't fair, is it? Of course it ain't! It ain't bloody fair! 'Delroy?' I knew that voice from anywhere. I've been hearing it since I was 13 years old. Now, it wasn't Michael saying my name that made my body go cold in that instant. It was the way he said it. It was the tone, yeah? The same tone he continued with. 'You all right, mate?' Now, why was he saying it like that? 'You all right, mate?' You don't use a tone like that to your mate, especially to your best mate. The tone he was giving is the same tone you use to your grandparents, when they get carted off to the nearest care home. It was then I realised I hadn't been thinking it. Fuck! I'd been sounding off like some high-level nutter for all to hear! Michael had heard every word of what I had just said, every lick. It had to be him, innit? I turned around to face him. 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Smashing, mate. Yeah.' He looked good, it had to be said. Yeah. He was true to his word when he said he was giving up the booze for a bit. The last thing he must have heard from me was me bellowing with laughter when he claimed he was giving up the sauce. 'Fuck off, mate!' I goes, delirious. 'Ha-ha! Do one!' I haven't laughed that hard since Eddie Murphy's stand-up comedy film. Delirious? That bit when he's taking the right piss out of his dad? 'Eddie, this is my house, 'if you don't like it, you can get the fuck out.' But the proof was in the pudding. There he was, my mate Michael, standing there, just standing there looking all lean and shit. Someone had put him in a right nice suit. Must have been the new girlfriend Carly told me about, when we sat down to have our Friday night pizza. 'The one who does yoga, ' is how she described her. 'I mean, she's good for him. She's got him into Pilates and shit.' 'What? Michael Fletcher? On a mat, bending?' I goes, shook. 'Yeah, yeah. Let's see how long it takes before he fucks that up for himself.' Feeling him move further and further away from me. 'I mean, it won't last.' I replied, trying hard not to reveal my hurt. Anyway, there he is, standing there, eyes wide with sympathy. 'How are you, mate?' I hadn't seen him for time – well properly, anyway. Not since his dad's funeral, when his Charlie-and-alcohol-ridden body had proceeded to dig me and everyone else he loved, well and truly out. I mean, that rant was epic. He went in. 'Delroy, my best mate! 'His parents came over from Jamaica, 'but he went and voted for fucking Brexit! 'I mean, fucking Leaver, he is. Jesus Christ, Delroy, what's the matter with you? 'When they want a curb on immigration, who do you think they're talking about? 'Delroy, I love you like a brother, yeah? 'You may sound like us, you may act like us, 'but you will never be one of us, and deep down you know it, you have to. 'Cos this is England we're talking about. 'You see, banana throwing on the pitch may not be a regular, but mark my words, yeah? 'It's making a comeback. It's coming out in droves. 'Yeah? Or maybe you choose not to.' Yeah, yeah. In a room full of English people, too, mate. He thought that by getting Carly to snog me at the wake it would somehow make all that shit go away. English amnesia again. I wanted nothing more to do with him after that. He killed our friendship there and then, stone dead. 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, smashing mate, ' I said with an age-old Black camouflage used for dealing with the English. 'Only, you're talking to yourself.' Fuck! He may as well have slapped me round the face with a white glove. 'I'm just letting off some steam, mate. 'Something you should know all about.' 'What?' I gave him a silent 'nigger please' with my eyes that Samuel L Jackson would have been proud of. 'Oh, ' he said, like he'd just stepped in quicksand. 'Really? Now? Look, alcohol made me...' 'Don't! Don't blame alcohol, mate! 'I knew you were selfish when you nicked Joseph Kiffin's break money for two terms.' 'Delroy, are you OK? 'I am eager to be in service of you right now.' In service? Eh? 'What's he eaten?' I thought. He stood there, all open and honest, all fucking... I don't know what, but not Michael Fletcher. Like he wanted to talk about what happened, to say sorry at long bleeding last. I was thinking he didn't just deserve the beating I gave him that night, more like he earned it, but... But if he was willing to put his hand up at last for that, fair dues to the man. But I find with Michael it's always wise to give him a gentle reminder about such things. You know, forgive but never forget. You gotta watch the English, you know. Any excuse to rewrite history and turn on the self-righteous tap, they will bag it. Michael, although I loved him like a brother, was no different. 'Come on, mate. She's mad for you.' 'It's over!' I said it. Did I mean it? I don't know but it spread out my mouth like a COVID cough. 'I've had it with her.' My wet eyes betraying my certainty. 'You just need to reflect.' 'Reflect?' 'She's giving birth to your kid. Time, Delroy. Time.' 'Now, I ain't been to church since I was 17, but Lord! Jesus! Fuck! 'Is there anything else you want to tell me, Michael? 'Anything you want to lecture me on seeing as you're so sorted, you cunt?' My hand now shaking in fear of myself. 'Who the fuck do you think you are?' 'I don't think I am anyone, but I am sorry you feel that way, mate.' He's straightening himself up to show his size over me. 'Mate? Mate? When was the last time me and you were mates? 'We haven't been mates since you shafted me at your dad's funeral. 'Remember that, gave me a right seeing to in front of everyone?' 'I know what I did, ' he said, closing his eyes in shame. 'You know what you did? And?' He then lifted his chin, in that Ray Winstone kind of way, he flared his nostrils. 'I am sorry.' He opened his palms like Francis of bludclarrt Assisi and said... 'I'd like to make amends. I'm sorry, Delroy, not just for that.' 'Amends? How are you gonna do that?' Nothing back from him. 'Don't worry. I'll wait.' 'I don't know.' 'Yeah! Course you don't! The English never seem to know.' 'But I am sorry.' 'All that stuff you said to your dad when he's dead, when he couldn't do nothing. 'Why didn't you say any of that when he was spinning that racist stuff to me? 'Why didn't you say something then to me? 'You never said sorry about him to me Michael. You said nothing to me! 'Was I just meant to take it? Meant to live with it, huh? 'How you gonna make amends for that?' 'I am truly sorry, Delroy.' Now, he said it. He definitely said it. But what I heard in that one word 'sorry' was all that he said to me at the church. All over again. It wasn't torture to him. It meant nothing then, and it still don't. 'All right, Michael, what is this?' I said, cooling my face with some tap water. 'Why are you standing there like you've finally read a book in your miserable life? 'Have you had help? Who you been talking to?' Nothing back from him, so I styled it out a bit by dragging the paper towel out with the flourish of a young matador. 'And don't say it's got anything to do with your new bendy bird, the yoga one? 'Because from what I hear, she ain't that bright. 'Not unless they're giving out PhDs for getting your leg over your head. 'So what gives? Who's been helping you? Whose your new friend, Michael? 'Who the fuck is it?' He stood there, looking around the room for the answer but he stayed silent. He had an answer, he just didn't want or couldn't give it. His right, I suppose. But here was my right to tell himself about himself. 'Michael, I don't business if you are sorry. Fuck that you are sorry. 'Take your sorries and ram them up your shithole!' 'I... I'm sorry you feel that way, mate.' 'Michael, are you deaf? Did you not hear what I told you to do with your sorries?" But I wanted his sorries, his friendship, his love – but I wanted action more. 'All right, Delroy, just as you like. 'I didn't come here for this. I just want to see my sister.' 'No, no, no, no. I don't think so, bitch. 'You stay right there. You don't move an inch. 'I got a whole heap of shit I want to say to you, bwoy.' 'All right, Delroy, say what you feel. Get it off your chest.' The more decent he was, the more I wanted to thump him in his face! 'That's what you said to me when you slagged me off for voting Brexit. 'You want to know why? Why, I voted for Brexit?' 'Because of all of this! 'This day that I've had. 'This shit that we are living in needs to come down! 'That's why! Fucking Great Britain?' I had to say something, I had to. 'Is someone having a laugh here?' How much of it I meant, I still don't know. 'The rest of Europe is no better.' But I had to give it to him. 'Fucking France, rhatid Spain...' Had to let him see me. 'Them saps who come from Germany!' Finally see me. 'England still treating the have-nots like shit!' So in the effort... 'It's a house of lies, fucking lies. 'Racist fucking liars, mate.' ..be understood clearly. 'So, I say bring it down, bring it all down! 'Tear it up, tear it all fucking up!' I grabbed him by his shirt. I twisted it in my fist. And I leaned in so close we could have kissed. 'This is where your old man and the rest of his right-wing nut jobs got it wrong, 'calling for Brexshit when they really thought 'that would mean seeing a few less brown faces on the streets. 'The same brown faces that was propping up the NHS when it was on its knees. 'Cos the same brown faces will be wiping their arses for them 'when they wind up in a care home one day. 'I don't just want Great Britain on its knees, Michael, no. 'I want to keep it there. That's why I voted for Brexit! 'Yeah? Let's see how great fucking Britain is then, when it's got no one behind them 'and has to rely on the likes of you, 'and the thick-as-shit working-class Brits like me! 'Who'll be on our rhatid hands and knees, cleaning the streets, 'wiping toilet bowls, sucking cock, wiping up sick? 'Yeah? Let the British be the people that no one sees, see how we like it. 'See how it feels to be the true niggers of the world. 'You think it's a joke? You're gonna find out. You're finding out now. 'How's it feel now, Michael? Still think you're number one? 'You fart! You're having a laugh. 'You are the laugh! 'Whose gonna come for you when you're down? Who's gonna save you? 'This is it for England, the end of the motherfucking line 'and I can't wait to see it happen, see it right at the bottom, 'where it can't be seen, yeah? 'Bring it! All of you! Like the big I am? Nah. 'You're nothing but a bunch of stupid, arrogant, lazy as fuck, 'snow-flaking, line snorting, Fred Perry wearing, 'red neck, pecker-wood, inbred, jellied eeled, fish and chips, 'gammon loving, tea drinking, bacon eating, dumb arse crackers! 'With your God Save The Queen, wrap ourselves around the Union Jack, 'we survived the Blitz, hands up if you won the war, 'take it up the arse from the US of A, Pukka Pies bullshit! 'Fuck England, R.I.P!' I said it. How I felt. Not what I knew, but how I felt. Not what I thought, but how I felt. And it felt good to say it! It was like a riot in my mouth. Yeah. I felt a freedom. Yeah, I felt free. And I breathed hard and heavy. Letting go of his now wrinkled shirt, I tried to compute what I just said. 'All right, Delroy. 'I'll see you around, ' he said, staring at his shirt. 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. See you around, yeah. 'See you fucking around, innit, yeah. 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. White male privilege, innit, Michael? 'Yeah, even you, 'a fucking third-rate white boy spiv is allowed to change. 'But not me. Nah, not my black arse self. 'Nah, I've got to stay, gotta stay Black, stay silent, right? 'Yeah? 'Gotta stay street, innit? Yeah? Stay silent. Yeah?' 'This, this... this ain't you.' And then he turned away... and walked away from me! 'You don't know me, Michael! You never knew me, none of you! You don't know me! 'You have to know me to say something like that! 'So, come on, Michel, come on! Get to know me! 'Get to like me! Get to understand me! Get to love me!' Something snapped inside of me. It broke off, I could feel it. 'Get to respect me! 'Get to value me! Get to trust me! Do the work, Michael! 'It ain't rocket science! All of yer!' 'Do the fucking work! Do the work! 'Do the work! Do the work! ..the work, the work!' And I just had to leave, I had to. I couldn't take them any more, any of them. It was all ruined. The day, the love, the lot. So I walked out on them, all of them, they were dead to me. And then came court. You may or may not be aware, your honour, that I've managed to fall out, disagree with, um... to make vex four different lawyers who had agreed to take on my case, all pro-bono I should add. Oh, by the way, 'vex' means anger. As in 'to make angry' in Jamaican patois. Thought I'd clear that up, as language is part of the whole point I'm trying to make here. Anyway, what I'm saying, badly, is that they, the lawyers, didn't want me doing what I'm doing now, a closing speech, so we parted ways. Now, why? You could ask. See, I think it was all in an effort to not be me. They didn't want me to be me, your honour, cos me isn't good enough to be understood or respected or taken seriously by the likes of you. Now, I thought that was kinda... off-key. You know? Rude? About you! About your level of intellect and bandwidth to understand human behaviour or character. It also kinda assumed you'd be racist and perhaps fall into the same biases as I believe my case has pointed out. So, I'm gonna be as honest and myself as much as I can. I'm gonna be me, in the hope that you can see me and understand the point at which it went wrong with the police – to try and convince you I'm a good guy stopped on a bad day. Anyway, now, you've heard already my account of what happened and their conflicting account? All right. I guess you don't need to answer. It was kind of rhetorical. And of course the 'shove' as they put it, and the bad language could be seen as crasses, as in 'bad behaviour'? But I'd like you to think of this. When a man's put under pressure, as you know I was, as any dutiful father would feel on the way to the hospital to see the birth of their child. I was prang, dented, out of shape, prang. That's how I felt rushing to the hospital and that, having got the message late. Prang. Excited but prang. I mean, that's all understandable, right? A little nod would do, your honour, just so I know... Yeah, calm, as in... Never mind, but you see how I use language is different, right? It's not wrong, it's just different. A swear word to you is an adjective to me. It's all right, Mum! Sorry, sorry. Me mum's screwing at me, bwoy. Upset. At me. Actually, my mum... my mum, now, she is an amazing woman but you lot... Well, not you, personally. But maybe you, as you did nothing, I bet, really hurt her and me. The Windrush scandal? What? Yes, this is to do with my case, actually. It's not quite what I've written down, you could argue that it's a detour, but hear me out still. I think it talks of the same thing, culture. A disrespected culture. A misrepresented culture. Cos everyone knew she was British, right? She had every right to be here and ting yet you people or, to be fair, your people, or the people you put in charge had hatched, concocted a devious plan to rid yourself of us! My mum! Who I'd watched work herself into the ground, paying her taxes, put her bloody life at risk as a frontline worker she did. She was to be told 'come out!' But hear what now. I think I felt it worse than she did, cos I have to stay here. I love what I've built. I love where I live. It's all I know, so I'm kind of like lost. Cos I'm made complicit. I'm made her enemy. Cos I'm powerless to do anything. So where do I put that, your honour? Hm? Where? Where do I get to house that anger? Where do I get to shoot that anger at? Cos to me, it's like all you people told my mum 'you can't stay here any more, 'cos we didn't want you here in the first place.' And it makes a knot in all of us that can't be untied. So when PC Stink Breath over there tells me... Wait. Hear me out! Hear me out! When he tells me not to swear, yeah, like I'm his chattel or something, the complete embodiment of the wastemen that wanted to send my mum back to a country she'd never lived in? That wanted to disregard all her efforts to make something of her life, to be a model Brit, it's not only hard to take, it's bloody hard to do to not swear! Your honour, I couldn't help myself. I can't help it. I couldn't help it. It's part of my culture, my working-class culture. My British culture. It don't make me bad. Mate, I weren't even swearing at him. I said, 'Oh, for f's sakes' to myself, because I was going to miss the birth of my child! A one-time event! Made for me to share with my woman and he was killing that stone dead. Dead! I mean, anything can happen in childbirth, right? She could have died or something. The baby could have. So, I had to be there. So of course I lost my cool, my focus. Of course I forgot my... place! Wouldn't you, your honour? Huh? How can we blanketly... You see, it's all about the context. The context, your honour. Yeah, how can we blanketly throw these laws, these rules, these judgements, these morals down without... Like threaten my livelihood, take away my job without truly understanding and allowing for the context, how? Well, unless... unless... Well, unless you're happy to be some kind of cunt! No, no, no, no. Wait. Stop. Please, stop. Wait. No, no, no. No, get off me! Aagh! No, get off me! Get off me! ♪ ...Drinks a glass of cold champagne wine... ♪ To say that Carly isn't technically minded is an understatement. She can't even set up a new smartphone without fucking it up. And don't get me started when she switched her broadband package from BT to Virgin. 'So many cables! All these wires! 'Where does this one go?' 'There and there, ' I kept saying. 'Cable with the red bit goes in the red hole. Blue bit, blue hole. 'It's nowhere near as hard as you're making it, babe.' Not a clue. Common sense right out the window. So, you imagine my surprise, sitting here in lockdown, when my laptop here was telling me not only do I have an email from Carly, but its also a folder, a file, a video file. I don't know who taught her how to do that, but I wanted to shake their hand when I weren't kissing their feet. So what gives, I thought? Is she up for apologising for cussing me out the hospital? Cos I don't want to know. I don't want to hear. Me and her are done. D-O-N-E! I'm finished with her. Where's my drink? Well, it couldn't hurt to hear what she has to say, though, could it? Fuck it, I thought. 'What's going on, knob-head? What's going on?' 'What do you want, Carly?' I said without thinking. Only realising a quick second later that this was a recording. I couldn't help it, it's her face, you see? That annoying, but beautiful, sexy, come-to-bed eyes, Mel from EastEnders look on her face? Could have kept her face on pause all day, but I needed to hear what she had to say. 'How come you haven't come round to see us and that? 'She's your kid as well. What's the matter with you? Are you thick or something?' 'You bloody know why!' I say again, knowing full well this was a recording, but I can't help it, I didn't business. 'You always want attention, innit, Delroy? 'Everyone's got to run around and make a fuss about you. 'What are you, seven or something?' 'Yes bitch, keep it up.' 'Well, I ain't playing.' 'Do, I look as if I care?' 'If you think I'm gonna to tell you how much I miss you, Delroy, you can dream on.' 'I'm dreaming now. Watch me.' 'I ain't got the time or the energy to tell you how much I miss you, 'I ain't got time for it, Delroy.' 'Good!' 'I ain't gonna say I ain't got time to tell you 'how much I miss the way you look at me.' 'Say what?' 'When you stare at me so intense with those gorgeous brown eyes of yours, 'I find it hard to look back. 'I ain't gonna say how much I miss looking at you. 'Your beautiful chiselled face that just makes me want to bite you. 'Rrar! 'I ain't gonna say how much I miss the way my skin tingles all over 'whenever you touch me, whenever you hold me in your arms. 'Whenever I think of our weekends together in Blackpool. 'All those showers we had together.' Damn, girl! She went in! 'No, I ain't gonna say any of that, Delroy Francis Tomlin, 'but what I will say is fucking call me, you twat!' No, no, no. I ain't calling her. What? Like I must do what she says? Are you mad? I'm not calling her, bruv. I ain't calling her, Rebecca. I ain't! Ain't calling her! Ain't. Fuck her! Fuck 'em all! I ain't calling her. – – Shit! It's her! I know it's her, it's Carly. That's her ringtone video call. Face still scowling, I bet. But still beautiful. Still my Carly. Fucking hell! Well, all right. If you're gonna make a thing of it, all right. Yeah, what? You, all right, Del? – Yeah, I'm all right, babe. What's up? Your mum told me what happened to you in court and that. – Yeah. – You were found guilty? Yeah. Why you couldn't fuckin' well tell me that to begin with, I do not know. – If you gave me a chance, I would have. – I wanted to see if you were all right. Babe, I'm all right. I'm just here, innit. I was giving birth and I wasn't in my right... I know, babe. I know. What I said to you before in the hospital still stands you know. – What? – You're still a prat, Delroy. – All right, babe. – A colossal prat! – Jesus Christ. – Michael told me what you said to him. Going all political, fuck England and that, I mean, what the fuck, Delroy? – Woman never lets me speak. – When did you care about any of that? – Since now. – You've never been on a single march. When have you ever held a placard in your hand, you twat? Are you done? The little people are the ones that matter to you, the little ones. You said that. Your mum and that, my mum and that, friends, family, the little things. Well, you've got two little things right here. Oh, shit. It's my baby. Our baby. Little things, Delroy. She's number one, I'm number two. So, what are you going to do about that, then? What the fuck do I say in response to that? I love you, Carly. You want to hear me say it? I love you, girl. From the time I was 15 until now, I love you. I never stopped. Even though you drive me mad with your chat, like nails on a chalkboard half the time, I love you! Even though you're always an hour late whenever we go out, I love you! Even though you hate my mum's Jamaican patties, but you yam them down anyway, every last bit, I love you. And if you were here right now, I'd fling you down on my bed and I'd show you how much I love you, because I do. I love you. I love you. Carly? Carly, you just going to sit there, looking all nice? Say something, babe. We're in bloody lockdown, I don't know when I'm gonna get to see you both again. - – Carly, what? What? I can't hear you. - – It's cracking up. Carly, Carly? The picture's frozen! Carly! See, this is when I want to go to fucking war with Zoom! I just want her back! Ah, why did I have to leave the hospital? Bloody lockdown, pain in the arse fer trut. I just want to see my little baby girl for the first time. Hold her in my hands for the first time. All this 'if it bleeps you're in breach' shit. Yes, Delroy! Blame the courts, blame Michael, blame Carly, blame your mum. Blame everyone, but don't ever think about blaming your stupid, proud, dumb arse, unemployed self. What a total claart you are! I am a dad. And nothing can change that, nothing. And Carly is her mum, the woman I created her with. And nothing will ever change that. See, it's not an opinion. It's not about faith. It's not about loyalty, it's a fact – a scientific fact. Unlike all the bullshit in the papers, on the news about immigration and inflation and Conservatives and Labour and Christians and Muslims, all those things. Opinions, choices, desires. I have made... No, no. We've made something factual. I guess that's what all the fuss was about, about kids, about family. We've made a fact – a living breathing fact. And no matter how long she lives, nothing can take that away. Look at 'em, both of them looking like they've been frozen in time. Oh, my days! She's got my soft-shaped Caribbean nose! I'm humbled to the core, man. I'm looking at her mouth. And, er... it's not my mouth. It's not gonna grow into my shape either. It's frugal in size, but perfect. It bears no resemblance to Carly, but I know that mouth. Oh, my... It's fucking Alan Fletcher! Alan's mouth! Alan fucking Fletcher, just really small and brown. He's back! I can't believe it! He's living on through me! Fuck me! I wonder what he would have made of that. Because I knew what a racist he could be. I had to suffer his jokes for time. I had to suffer him forcing Carly to hide me, watching Michael cowering from him. But it was him that took me to the Repton boys club with Michael, him that dropped me home after football, him that screamed on the side lines at me. 'Come on, you long streak of piss!' And encouraged me to score. Out of anger, yeah, but I scored! I got the glory. And there he was, on the face of my child. We're knitted, woven together forever. That is a fact. That is an irrefutable cast-iron fact. His history was now my history. And I have to own it without anger or hurt. I have to forgive. I have to learn to forgive. I have to learn and forgive. What a bundle she is. A sheer bundle of joy. I wonder how she feels. I wonder how she smells. I'm sorry I didn't stay. I'm sorry I left. Like she cares, considering how early she was, She just wanted to get out here, anxious to start her life and that. Fighting to get out there, yeah. She's a fighter, I can tell. She's my little fighter. She's gonna fight on, no matter what you do. She's gonna live on, no matter what you say. And so am I, so am I. I'm gonna fight on and on and on and on. She is a fact. She is my fact. My everything and nothing else matters. Nothing can and nothing should.
