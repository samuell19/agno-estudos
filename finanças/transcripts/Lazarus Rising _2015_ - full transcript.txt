(silence) (dramatic music) - [Voiceover] So this is it huh? Can't say I'm surprised. Some advice, the one useful thing my pop told me was where you end up in life was determined by the choices you make. And that's from a guy who drank himself to death. But how did I get here? Oh yeah, a lot of choices in the last four days. (dramatic music) (fast paced beat) - Uh, what are you fucking doing? - Well I just kind of though that-- - You fucking thought? You're not paid to fucking think. You're paid to box. Box. Fucking dumbasses. (sliding sound) - They call me Fitz. I ain't no disposal. No questions asked, to live in. (grunting) (gun shots) (dramatic music) - Fitzie. - [Fitz] Today's mark. Freddie. He should of known better. They all should know better. You are done cooking the books Freddie. - Come on Fitz. (gun shot) (dramatic music) - [Fitz] This is Angelica. My partner. She enjoys this job a little too much. If I were you, I'd get out of town. - Yeah no shit. (guns shot) - First rule. No witnesses. (gun shot) (laughing) - That was hot. Yeah baby you kids is hot! (laughing) Looks like that 40 grand is forgiven baby. - [Fitz] Silent Cal. Two many debts in too many places. - Back to zero! You know in way that kind of makes me feel up again. - You're not up you're late. (laughing) - Obviously. You ain't a gambling man. I wasn't late I'm back up. I backed your ass up. There's one right there with my signature on it. (gun shot) - I'm sorry Cal. Orders. (laughing) - What's so funny? - Give it time machine kid. Welcome to your future. (gun shot) (dramatic music) - Future. That's not a word I think about a lot. You can't in this line. You can only think about yourself. (rock music) - [Fitz] Why Silent Cal? - He lost his etch. It happens to the best of them. At one time he was the best. You keep playing solitaire that'll be you. You best get your shit tightened quick, before I have to partner you with my brain dead cousin. - [Fitz] This is Dallen, my boss. He's a prick. Needless to say I like him. - Word of advice, don't ever work with family. Stop screwing Ang. - You know know me better than that. - Yeah exactly. (whistles) (phone ringing) What? (soft rock music) - Coming by? - Ang. - [Ang] Fuck you then. - You were supposed to unload it. - Who is it Fitz? - There's no who. - I might be slightly psychotic. But I'm a great piece of ass. I work a dick like Picasso painting the Mona Lisa. So you ain't turning this down out of principal. There's no fucking way. There's some other bitch. - [Fitz] There is no other girl. - [Ang] You can't be straight can you? Just not in your DNA is it? - It's Da Vinci, not Picasso. - James Connolly talks about change, but seems to change his mind a lot. Especially about the three rivers project. (light rock music) - Hey Fitz. - Dana. How you doing? - Fine. How are you? - I'm good. Anyone stop by? - Nah, no visitors. Kind of like me. - You're still seeing him. - No. - You'd tell me right? - Of course Fitz. - Well you let me know if he comes back. - Okay. I will. Hey Fitz. When are you gonna come visit me? - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow, tomorrow. You and your tomorrows. - Runs in the family. Tammy. Her boyfriend beats her but she never leaves. Says he loves her. (light rock music) I take confidence self preservation. You don't look for yourself, nobody else will. - Be careful. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Okay ready? And spin around here we go! Yeeehaw! Okay Daddy's dizzy. I'm James Connolly and I approve this message. (phone vibrating) (phone beeping) - [Fitz] Emma. Beauty, brains, and savvy. Wouldn't think she'd give me a second look. - Get out. Leave. And just so you know early morning alarms are not gonna fly. No way. No how. Not if you're gonna sleep over. (soft music) - So you just use me for sex, and then you kick me out. - Hmm. Pretty much. At least until I move. - You'll never think of me again. - Oh you're tough. You'll get over it. (chuckles) - Why would anyone wanna move out of a loft in this side of town? You're not the only one thinking about a fresh start. Maybe we can both use-- - Michael. Not at 7:30. (chuckles) Brush your teeth (laughing) - You are by far the most charming woman that I've ever had the pleasure of being used. - You're so sweet. - What? - Nothing. I'm going back to sleep. - Fine. I have to work. (slow music) - Mmm. Nice ass Mr. Fitzpatrick. (chuckles) - We'll talk. - You'll talk. I will listen. Maybe. (tv in background) (dramatic music) - [Voiceover] You two need to shape the fuck up. Plenty of competition looking to slide right into your spot. Pretty sweet spot to be in isn't it? Oh yeah you comfortable? You good? You wanna put your feet up? Regular work, good pay. Shit man, benefits? Benefits! What other offer can put you on a payroll and give you medical! Huh! And you know me I don't give a shit one way of the other. Spics, ginnies, waps, chinks, no offense Ang. Honkies, fucking dykes, kites, dicks, cunts, midgets, fucking martians I don't care! You do the job, I'll hire you. You screw up you're gone! I don't care if you're part of the family or not, Jeff. - [Fitz] He's not kidding. Jeff and Kevin. One dominant titled, the other's head so far up Dallen's ass he needs a flashlight to see daylight. Ill let you figure out which is which. - Huh? - Kevin, please say you're listening. - [Kevin] Always boss. 110%. (phone ringing) - Yeah? Shit. What permits? Shit! Alright get out! - [Kevin] Alright sure thing boss. - And hey! Keep pulling those signs, I don't wanna see Green's name anywhere. Close that job. (dramatic music) - [Fitz] When Freddie steals, his whole syndicate pays the price. How it works in this business. (gun shot) - You're getting boring, Fitz. - Sean. My baby brother. I took this job because it paid enough to put him through college. He comes back with a drug habit. - Shit happens. - No Sean, you happen. - I'll get it. - How? - Give me 200. You wanna get fat give me 200 alright. Four and it'd be quicker. You are good. One of the best. (rock music) k Get paper baby k That's my thing k Just put that money on the table k And walk away k Because I'm all about that business k And that's my game k Never gonna change - You ain't hustling you being hustled. - Got that right. - You gonna go blow that cash? - Hey like pop always said, smack, shoes, socks, we all blow it somewhere. - I'm not sure he said that. - Paraphrasing. - Cut the bullshit man. You're clean? - Yeah, yeah. Come on alright. (soft music) - I don't know if you ever seen an Armenian woman naked before but it's like big foot coming at you. You know what I mean? (laughing) - The crew. Psychos, misfits, and perverts. - When she turns around she looks at me gun in hand, and she smiles. - One big fucked up family. Colleen. Influenced all the way to the top. Cold as ice. Margaret. Cute, in a real she could either kill you or fuck you kind of way. Thought about making a move, but I realized one thing. She scares the ever living shit out of me. - Totally fucked my shit up. The guy catches wind and he goes for his piece. Boom! I snap out of it he's done. Boom! D-U-N dun, alright. - [Fitz] Casey. I could tell you but you'll learn all you need to know soon enough. You need some new material. - You all better cut this bullshit and repent. - Lizette. Always messing with that roger like she can take back what she's done. (up beat music) - I ain't your errand girl. Go get your own fucking money. - You two uh, quite a team over there Fitz. - [Fitz] Fuck you Casey. - Oh fuck me huh? Okay. Just make sure you ready to back us up huh. - [Voiceover] Dallen. I know the two of you went way back. But Silent Cal had to go. Left his ass in the greens. Liabilities have to be dealt with. - [Dallen] I'm not questioning your judgement, I'm just saying clue me in. - [Voiceover] I'll clue you in, when and if I see fit. Know your place. Get your damn cousin in line. He's late. - [Dallen] Late? Shit. It'll be taken care of. (dramatic sounds) Let me talk to Jeff. Well get him asshole! - What's all this? - Ugh. Connolly. He's got his dick in everything. Literally and figuratively. Shits rolling down hill let me tell you. - Cleaning day? - [Dallen] Tomorrow. - What they do? - You paid to connect the dots? Didn't think so. As far as you.. Hello! What is your damn problem Jeff? Draw you a map but your too fuckin' stupid to read it. (dramatic music) Yeah. Dolt. (dramatic music) - Cleaning day. All business taken care of no matter how small. How the fuck is Emma on cleaning day? Smart move here is to cut her free. Move on. Dallen always says have an exit plan. But I'm not Dallen, and he never met Emma. I'm not sure if Emma is who she says she is. But I'm not sure if I can go through with this. - Oh. - What did you do Emma? - Oh my gosh that's so... hold on. - What did I tell you about locking the fucking door? (rock music) (moaning) - [Voiceover] Three days before the election, candidate James Connolly broke ground last night at a new housing development, located on E street river. This continues his stunning turn around on his environmental policies that had aimed at protecting waterways and rivers. When asked about his turn around, Connolly continues to have no comment. Back to you Pam. (tv in background) - He said you work for Connolly right? - Hm? - Connolly? What you do for him? - Clean rivers act. Until I sold out. You know that. - Did you fuck him? - What? - You heard the question. - Who I fucked, fuck, or going to fuck, is none of your business. - So that's a yes. - Are you picking a fight? Is that what this is about? Is that why you were different last night? - Different? - Rough, Michael. I have bruises. And now your pulling passive aggressive bullshit asking questions you already know the answers to. You met me at a Connolly rally. You know I worked for him. - So you decided to go slum up with security huh? Who's really paying for this place anyway? - Get the fuck out. - Not a problem. - Well up yours, and the horse you rode in on. 'Cause that ain't happening. Yeah. Love you too. Happy birthday. All old business gets cleaned up today. - I love cleaning day. - [Dallen] It's all there. Half the targets for you. Half for Case and Liz. We need to goddamn learn to be on time for once. - I got dibs on the bitch. Emma. I love cutting a bitch. - That is exactly why she's not on your list. - Dall? Dibs? - [Dallen] Get out and go to work. That was your cue. Move. (dramatic music) - What's going on Fitz? - Nothing. - Bullshit. - You just call bullshit. - Yeah bullshit. You know what you are Fitz? You're one of those little planes. A puddle jumper. Yeah that's it. You jump from puddle to puddle. A short stop on the way to eventual destination. But that's all you'll ever be. And you'll keep jumping and jumping until one day you crash and burn. Poof. You'll be gone. Forever. Nothing. And nobody remember you. 'Cause that's what puddle jumpers are. Replaceable. - I need to make a pit stop. - Hm. We're on the clock. - I'll be quick. (dramatic music) - It is what it is. I got no other solutions. - [Sean] If you (mumbles) Definite beginning, middle and end. So I keep that reminder. - [Fitz] Reminder? - The subtle under toe of life. - [Fitz] It's good to see all of my hard work is being put to good use. - It was your dream. Not mine. - I need you to do something for me. - Now? - [Fitz] Today. - I need you to go to my apartment and get the bag. - In your closet? - [Fitz] Yeah. - You planning something? - Just a precaution. - (scoffs) How official. - Sean. Get the bag and hold it. It's important. I need it and I can't go myself. - Yeah fine. Is that it? - Yeah. Hey. You gotta cut this shit out. - Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow. (fast paced music) - We got Freddie, Jim. We know you're helping him. (grunting) Really? - We're partners Fitz, and you're breaking the trust. - And you're breaking my balls. (gun shots) Fuck you. You're on clean up. I'm out. - All charm. The even need of life so low. You know how I hate the water. (dramatic music) Two jobs, survive Ang, and maybe Case and Liz won't get to Emma. What Fitz, keep your head, work it out, exit plan. (fast paced beat) - You got a text. From Emma. I saw it, I know. I thought, I know an Emma. - Ang, you don't know whats going on. - You're right. I don't know whats going on Fitz, because you my partner, you forgot to tell me. - I couldn't. - So I went to Dallen. - You shouldn't have done that. - Don't worry I didn't tell him. His feelings would be really hurt. But I did have to call it in over his head. Why did you do that Fitz? Why did you fuck this one up? Now you're gonna run off with a mark? - She's not a mark. - She's a mark Fitz! - She's under my protection. - Okay. Well who's gonna protect me? - Ang. - You know what I have to do now. - Just give me a five minute start, and it's all I'll ever ask of you again. - Ever again? Okay. I don't know what you think five minutes is gonna do for you but... - Ang. (gun shot) (dramatic music) - [Casey] Stay in the car. - [Lizette] You don't want me to come with you? (chuckles) - We gonna do a hit we not saying freaking mass, forget about it. (laughing) - It's you Michael isn't it? - [Fitz] Yeah. - Ang? - [Fitz] She gave me no choice. - Yeah well she always was by the book. Made her valuable. Reliable. - [Fitz] She was a good girl. - Ang wouldn't go that far. So what's the deal? Warned you about getting close it opens the flood gates. - Can't justify it anymore? - [Dallen] Is that a conscience? Oh you are definitely not Ang. I miss her already. Didn't even know you'll do this (unclear). - (unclear) - [Dallen] What she think, about you? - That I work security. - [Dallen] When you tell one lie, well you know the rest. - Call it off. - No can do it's already been run up the chain. - What did you do Dallen? - Leave. Just run. GPS says your close but there's time. Leave the car, leave the phone just leave. Get out the jail free card here. - [Fitz] I already changed cars and besides that's bullshit. - Yeah but it sounded good didn't it? - [FItz] Thanks for all the help. - I can only do so much for you. (dramatic music) Oh Michael your real heart. Let's end this. Clean and quick. - Now. (phone ringing) - What? - Ang tells me you're having trouble. I'm sending someone in. - Already? Ang. - [Voiceover] That good girl. - Look. It's just a small complication but I'll deal. I've got my reserve team-- - There isn't time for a reserve team. Wouldn't you agree. - Yeah. - [Voiceover] I'm calling in Gray. - Gray? Do you really think that's-- - Yes I think it's necessary. And you'll fall in line in this. Or you'll end up on the other end of the list. - You know he's unpredictable. - But effective. - I really wouldn't-- - [Voiceover] You don't make that call. I do. - [Dallen] Right. - Assemble all the necessary information for him. - I'll put together a report. Son of a bitch. Colleen? When Gray gets here out a tracer on his car. (dramatic music) (laughing) - Kinda smells like laulex Fitzie. Can't say I approve but hey I understand. (laughing) (grunting) (rock music) (grunting) Look what I got for ya. Fitzie! Look at this. You like some of that? (grunting) (rock music) (gun shot) - What the fuck are you doing here? (screams) - Stop. We gotta go now. (dramatic music) - Case. You pervert. Casey's dead. Target's away. In pursuit. (dramatic music) You took out the cell? - Yeah. - [Liz] Drive. Go! - [Fitz] Okay, smashed the cell so they can't trace us. Keep our heads. It'll be okay. What the fuck is Emma doing on a cleaning day? - He did it. (soft music) Hypocritical asshole put me on a list. I was moving for Christ sake. He was your boss. Silent partner. - How much do you know about Connolly? - He's a front. Real estate to launder money. He made deals, promises to push permits and rezoning through and they'd get him elected. One hand washes the other. - You didn't go to the cops or the media? - I helped him Michael. I didn't know it but the clean rivers act, donations grants, all of that was just a front. Guilted lover seeks revenge turns out to be involved. I wasn't gonna be that girl. I am however the girl who believed his bullshit. Twice. - Trusting politicians is usually a bad idea. - Really? Hadn't put all that together yet. Who are you Michael? - Exactly you think I am. You don't have to like me. You don't have to like what I do. But until we get out of town you have to stick with me. Got it? - What do we do now? - We just need to keep moving. (slow music) - Jesus H. Gray? - [Gray] Yeah. - You must be. Hey how about a knock or something next time huh? (laughing) Give a guy a little heads up (chuckles). Yeah so they told me they were calling you in. This must mean it's a priority you know, no messing around. Yeah. I put together the ins and outs. Key points. Gotta junkie brother. Figure our best lead you know. Michael will probably go there before blowing town. Not the type to hang out to dry. Yeah. Lizette is outside. Her partner got taken out. I figured you two could team up and work together. So, I'll let her fill you in. Lizette get your ass in here. She's the best she's consistent, you'll like her. Lizette this is Gray. - Gray? It's an honor. (dramatic music) (grunts) (gun shot) - [Dallen] Jesus Christ you didn't have to shoot her! She was your partner! - [Gray] I don't do partners. - I was sure about her that should have been enough. Oh hey whoa hey listen. I'm just some dildo middle man. I pass info point A to point B. It's all in there. Shit. (slow music) - Sean, ship one down so I had to (unclear). I'll be at the place. They'll be looking for you so get there ASAP. (slow music) - How long do we wait? - I'm not leaving without Sean. - You sure he'll come? - He's bullheaded but he's not stupid. He just does things his own way. He had a six figure job until he quit. Said he couldn't handle being part of the machine. - So he gave up. - There's a lot of crap in this world. Sometimes it's better to go after your own little piece and make yourself happy. - Quite the optimist. - Realist. - That was sarcasm. - People as a whole are selfish and self centered. - Sounds like an excuse. - Excuse? - Yup. Lazy, jaded and selfish. Focus on yourself instead of trying to make things better. Nothing wrong with that, it's what everybody else does, but that's your perspective. No moral integrity, pain and suffering. So that's what you see. You're talking about moral integrity? - Uh, I haven't killed anybody so I think I'm still a little higher up on the curve than you, - Okay mother Teresa so what's your perspective? - It's not a lazy, jaded, selfish world. I'll tell you that much. The world's not perfect, it's cruel and it's unforgiving. But that doesn't mean you just give up. Whether you end the results or not, what matters is that you're trying. - And hows that working out for you? - Not so well. - So it's all about perspective. - Exactly. (sighs) Michael. - This way, Sean shit went down so I had to take the (unclear). I'll be at the place. They'll be looking for you so get there ASAP. (dramatic music) - 97, 98, 99, 100. - Shh. - Haha! I found you! - Sorry mister, you're friend left. I can't tell you which way though. That'd be cheating. - I understand. Without rules you have chaos son. Thing is, I got a couple rules myself. One, I get paid, always, and two, one way or another I get my information. Give me your hand. - Just point. - Well done. - [Fitz] I have some money stashed. As soon I know Sean's okay we'll get it and leave. - Won't they be waiting? - If they knew about it they would. - How can you be sure? - You got a better plan? - And I have to trust you? - To get you safe? Yes. It's what I do, Em. Only in reverse, but same concept. - Only in reverse. - Yeah. - Emma, you really stepped it up this time. Guess I deserve it though right? - Nobody deserves this. Especially you. I'm sorry this happened. - Michael. And you are? - Emma? - Sean. - This is serious. We'll leave. We're not coming back. - Yeah it's cool. I thrive on change. It still looks the same. - Pretty much. - You guys grew up here? - barely. You didn't get the bag. - It was next on my list. - Fuck Sean we need that bag it's really important. Is that why the guy was one me? - What's going on? - What's going on is the key to that locker, was in the bag I told Sean specifically to get. - [Sean] What locker? - Bowling alley. - Riverside? - Candlewood! - Pussies candlewood bowl. - [Fitz] Whatever Sean. - It was so easy. - Why don't you break the lock? The lock or door. Pry it open. At this point what's the difference right? - Alright well if we are leaving town I'm gonna need to make a stop. - No. - You need me functioning. - You are a liability. - You're the asshole that's got us in this and I'm a fucking liability? Yeah. We're making a stop. - We get clear. You are kicking. - Yeah, tomorrow. - Fuck you tomorrow. - Tomorrow, alright. - [Sean] Come on let's not fuck. (gun shot) (laughing) - Got you muthafucka. (car alarm beeping) Fitz. Who you with? - I'm Fitz. - I call him Fitz. - He's my brother. - Well that would make sense then. - I'm Emma. - Emma Fitz? - No. - Good. 'Cause that would be confusing. (laughing) Come on in ya'll. Cracker boy. Cracker boy. - Dude, that shit rots your brain man. - Really? Video games rot your brain. - [Guy] Gives little kids seizures and shit man. I'm just saying. - Ironic son of a bitch. - Hey he's right. - FYI. This here's a private conversation. - That's also not really irony. (chuckles) - God damn! PhD college boy in the house. Shit I gotta keep you around so you can keep me grammatically correct and shit. And you. What you some sort of genius too? - Nah. I'm just Fitz. - He's Fitz. I told you that. You need some individuality. We all somebody son. Stand up. Live large. (laughing) - I'm good where I am. - Life's built on dreams baby. And you. What about you? - She's fine where she is. - I'm in a state of transition, and I am perfectly capable of answering for myself. - God damn! You full of life huh. Loving it baby, We getting cozy up here now. We making magic. Feeling the love. (laughing) Rick. You gonna sleep all day? Motivate me. - [Woman] I'm tired. - [Guy] Yo how could you sleep with that shit on? Get up! We need to talk about your work ethic. And about how you ain't got one. - True story. - [Guy] Turn that shit down. - [Woman] Shut up cracker boy. You're on my last nerve. - Yeah okay Maisie. - [Woman] What you call me? - Maisie. - That some sort of crack, cracker boy? - It's Dr. Seuss. Horton hatches the egg. Go look it up. - Fuck you. And your soggy as limp dick cracker boy. - [Cracker boy] Yeah sure thing Maisie. - Wanna ride this? (dramatic music) - I'd keep your stash bro. Trust me. - [Maisie] Fuck you. I don't need this shit. From any of ya'll. I got plans. I'm out of here. - You wanna hang? Look, I know you all (unclear) went to shit. But man I got the hot hot rock. - Owen man, life's all about pace. You're a sprint man. I'm running the goddamn marathon. - Sprint? It's just good business. You get out what you put in. - [Emma] Sounds familiar. - Lovely Emma. - Hey. Maybe next time. - Baby if you ever wanna earn some extra cash, I can hook you up with some dates and shit. You can get paid not now but right now. - Nope. I'm good. But thank you. That's very, very nice of you. - Opportunity always are knocking. It's the land of opportunity right? Alright Fitz. (dramatic music) Alright cracker boy. Nut up. - Nut up man? What's that even mean? - [Guy] It means grab the goddamn control. That's what it means. (ominous music) - [Voiceover] Dallen. Partner, how the hell are you? - Same. - And this misses? - Mean and selfish same as always. - Good, good. We're nothing without our families are we Dall? - Nope. - I was talking up the chain, and they said they called in Gray on our little situation. - It was being handled, Grays a complication. - You know I have total faith in your abilities. And I hate to pull rang. - Clearly. - I though I'd keep and eye on my investment, and my support. - You're investment is more than paid off, and I don't think anybody wants you personally involved. - Fuck them. They think they're using me, I'm using them. They're gonna need me Dall, not the other way around. - Let me do what I do. Keep you out of harms way. - Women huh? - Never do what we want. - If they did, we wouldn't love them. I thought this would be easier you know? Clean and simple, but it's proven to be a bit more unsettling than I anticipated. I don't like emotional response Dallen. It betrays a reason. Know what I'm saying? Ah shit, enough bullshit, back to the machine. You give, good advice Dallen. Say hello to the wife and kids for me. You can see yourself out. (dramatic music) (soft music) - What is all around? - Hell fire's coming! We're on the damn judgment children! All of us. Jesus is watching. Jesus is waiting. He waits four fucking days. Lazarus, he should return and raise you. Lazarus, you shall rise. But you, you will not be saved. - Why me? - Fun deal Sean. - Lazarus! Do not joke. Time is short for you to repent and absorb yourself of your sins. Close your eyes. - Do it. Just do it. - Don't look at me. Apparently I'm screwed. - [Priest] Hail Mary full of grace, the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed be the... Blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Now Lazarus! You've been cleared of all your sins. Now you shall rise. - Man come get the shaft. - Who are you? - I am the word of god! And he forgives. - He? - God. - God is most definitely not a he. - You're kidding. - You okay? - Yeah. - Is she okay? What about me? Fuck Jameson over here just fucked me. Yeah that's about right. - Brings back memories. (screaming) - What? - [Sean] You just screamed like really loud. - So? - Just an observation. We gotta go. - I'm hungy. Menu please. Thank you. (ominous music) - Gray. They must be desperate. - I am the bottom line. - [Fitz] You're here to kill her? - [Gray] No. Rule number three. I don't kill mothers and children. Unless they interfere with rules one and or two. - Mothers? - [Gray] Life begins at conception. That's where I draw the line. - You're pregnant? - [Gray] Why do you think they want her so bad? - Wait. So you're pro life? - I believe what I believe. - That's irony. - Turn her over and our business is done. - What if I kill you? - That would be impressive. - There's a lot of money in that locker. - I saw. - You can take it. Forget about the contract. - I'm a professional not a mercenary. - Yeah. Principals everything isn't it? - Sean! So you're gonna take her from us? - No. You're going to give her to me. - Really? - Yes. Five seconds. - Quick question. Maybe a little off topic but killing people like legit? - Times up. - No. Fair enough. - Evening sweet bowling bitches! It is on! (rock music) (gun shots) - This way. - How am I doing? (grunting) - The hell happened to Jeff? - Friendly fire. - Thank you. (fast paced music) (grunting) (fast paced music) (grunts) (gun shots) (slow music) - Why didn't you tell me? - Because it's none of your business. - Who's is it? - Fuck off! - Not to ruin this tender little moment or anything, but if it's all the same to you I'd like to move. - Calm down Sean. - Calm down! Oh yeah this is just another day at the office for you huh? - Listen up. We're gonna get clear. Hold up and take a breath okay? - I'm gonna go take a shower. - Fuck you. - They're after her. - No shit. - Look, there's like-- - It's not happening Sean. So get it out of your degenerate junkie head. - Real nice. - I said it's not happening. - Fine. Not happening. Everything's gonna turn out great. Sunny day a okay right? Right. Beautiful. I'm out of here. - You sit down and shut-- - Why don't you shut the fuck up? You don't run my life. I'll be back. (rock music) (dramatic music) - Owen? Incredible. (crying) - You and I are gonna talk. - Not till she's gone. (gun shot) Oh god. - She's gone. Let's talk. (soft music) - I'm tired Michael. - Me too. - I just want to start over. I feel like I'm always doing for others. I give and I give and I don't feel like I've gotten much in return. - Now you gotta do for you sometimes. The world works on it's own terms. - I should have told you. I meant to. I just didn't. - I been thinking about Lazarus. (soft music) Dead four days. Raised by Jesus. - I didn't know you were religious. - Forced to catholic school doesn't make me religious. Maybe, it is a fresh start. For all the shit I've done. - How do you do it? Kill people? I can't imagine. - I guess my viewpoint just got shifted over time. I know it starts from zero. And the world intervenes and changed that perspective. My viewpoint just got shifted more than others. - I know what you mean. - No I still think you're pretty far ahead of the curve. - God creates on a curve. - Sure why not. (chuckles) - I like that. You're not all bad Michael. - Just mostly. - 50/50. (soft music) - Where's Sean? - Morning sunshine. Took it upon myself to provide a jolt for the two of you. Mike still black I assume. Emma, I wasn't sure how you took it, so I got cream and sugar. Bagels in the bag, and you're welcome. What? - Deja vu. Michael. Look familiar? I can kill you very easily. I don't need to. Not sure why. I just want the girl. - You dropped the dye. - I didn't have a choice. - Take her. - What? - Lazy, jaded and selfish right? - We free to go? - That was the deal. - Leave town and never come back. The gun? - Michael. (grunts) - It was a smart move! It was the only move! - No Sean! It was your move! This isn't over. - He's got your gun. - You think that's the only one I have? (dramatic music) We steal a car and we get to Dallen's. We can make it in time. Keep your head Fitz. Shit. Hold on and... If you run, don't come find me. Ever again. - Payment upon delivery. - They're coming. - I have to wait? - Just for a minute. You think he'll come for her? Yeah, good talk. - I dislike bureaucracy. I provide a service. I expect to be paid on time and in full. - We all gotta climb that ladder. (dramatic music) (alarm) He's here. (gun shots) (grunting) - He's in the garage! (grunting) - Where is she? - Gray took her. - Shes gone? Where? - Isn't that your responsibility? I'm middle management! - Middle management? You couldn't organize a piss off in a brewery! (dramatic music) - Alright Michael. You're all mine now. (grunting) Ready for some fun Michael? (grunts) - What's going on? - You're not authorized to here the answer to that question. - I'm not authorized! Tell me I'm not authorized! Hello? Hello? - This is your mess Dallen. You're either the solution or you're the problem. Lately you've become the problem. And you understand what I do with my problems, don't you? (dramatic music) Shit! - Get out of the car. Call him. - Who? - You worked at the office on Beacon. Have him meet us there. - So you can take turns fucking me over? - Call him. (phone ringing) - Connolly. - Hello James? Fuck you. - Well hello Sonia sprite. - I called him. - You're gonna meet us where she worked on Beacon. - And why is that? - Because I did things on my terms. And you still wanna win the election. - [Woman] Well James. A fine mess a day before the election. - I have to go. - That was unwise. - Story of my life huh. Series of bad decisions that only escalates. Lets say you and I work out something. On the side maybe. You may be a killer but you're still a man with needs. Why don't we forget about all of this? And just focus on you, and me. - Like what? - Like this. - My job is to bring you in. You're job is to escape. Begging and seduction only distracts you. Focus. There's still hope. Just don't look to me for it. (ominous music) - Everything you need. - I always liked Dallen. But then again, (gunshot) I liked Ang too. (beeping sound) - Yeah I thought I told you get support. Right. Ya wasn't that the guy cleaning up the mess? Well I haven't been impressed so far. They're here. Just you? - Just me. - That's great. - I can take care of myself. - (mumbles) Day before the fucking election. Just couldn't wait a couple days huh? Shit. What's your name? - Colleen. - No shit. I lost my virginity to a Colleen. 1979, was a hell of a year. - Lucky girl. - So you voting for me Colleen? - I don't vote. - What? - Politics is all bullshit. - Colleen. Democracy is the foundation of America. It's how we affect change. You don't vote, you don't count. - You're giving me a headache. - Apparently so. (dramatic music) - Did you bring my money? - It's all here. In full. - What? - He activated the GPS tracker. (dramatic music) (grunting) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa man. - Don't you move. - I won't move. (gun shot) (crying) You want more? I got more. There's plenty where that came from. Lots. - You wanna take me out? Change the game? - You have to know I have no part in this. You're a pro I would never ever think that-- - This is on my terms now. Shoot her. - I dont, I dont-- - You want her gone? You do it. Get a little dirty. - But, but, but, but, but, but if I shoot her, you'll shoot me. - No, no, no, no see. I deliver the girl. I got paid. You all tried to kill me but that's to be expected. I don't like to wait. And I hate people that pass the buck. Now you're gonna come off the top of that ladder and dirty your pretty little hands. Just enough to know what it's like! - Okay, okay. - So. Let's see, what kind of stones you got. Shall we? Shoot her. - I can't do this. (crying) - I'm not going in. You know what you gotta do man but I can't-- - I don't have time Sean. - I love you Michael. You're all I got. - I know. If I'm not back in 10, you go. - 10 seconds. - (crying) Please don't do this. You don't have to do this. You don't have to do this. You don't have to. Please don't. Please don't. (crying) - I'm not gonna shoot her. I'm not. (gun shot) (grunting) (grunting) - I, hate, heart. (gun shots) Focus. (gun shot) - There's still hope. You came back. (fast paced music) - You can end this. You're safe. - Help. Emma. (slow music) - It was thought to be a close call in the race for the senate. But developments over the last 24 hours seem to have pushed Connolly right over the top in this election. Speaking from his hospital bed as he recovers from a gunshot wound following yesterdays kidnapping and extortion attempt Connolly is described as both happy and gracious in victory. Senator James Connolly is taking the senate by storm. He's now fully recovered following a near fatal gunshot wound on the eve of the election. And these days you'll find him pushing through zoning reform, and paving the way for massive development in the greater metropolitan area. (rock music) - Soon Michael. Soon. - [Fitz] Choices. We all make them. It's learning to live with them that's the hard part. (soft rock music)
