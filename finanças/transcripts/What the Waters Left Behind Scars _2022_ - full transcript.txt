They're all dead, Captain. It's done. It's all clear. Awaiting instructions. Over. Full report, sergeant. Losses on our side? Over. None. It was very fast. We were done in 30 seconds. Lawrence and Paul are on their way back. Over. What about the Argentinean? Over. Five soldiers dead. Most of them were just kids. Those bloody generals are sending more and more kids to the battlefield. They were half frozen when we found them. They didn't see us coming. Almost no reaction. Just paralyzed by fear. They couldn't even grab for their rifles. They're harmless now. Like lambs. Over. Good job, sergeant. You get back to base now. Over and out. I'm gonna fucking kill you. What the fuck? What the fuck are you doing? No! I know it was right to sink her, and I would do the same again. Not very impressive, huh? It's a shit hole. A fucking shit hole. Is this the best place you found? It's the only one in town, Mark. It's not that bad. Could be worse. I can't believe this fucking tour is a waste of time. Don't go to that awful bathroom. It's filthy. Okay. We are up in 10 minutes, guys, you ready? -Fuck off. -Are you okay, love? No, I'm not. Of course I'm not. Every bloody town is the same crappy venues, crappy sound. Crappy audience yelling for The Clash covers. We should be able to say at least they listen to our music. Am I right? Anyway. Hey, are you listening to me? Did they pay us this time? They didn't. Mark, every time it's the same story. They pay us after the show. I told you this already. Fuck it. I'm not playing tonight. What? I'm sick of it. We are being scammed everywhere we go, every time. Okay, it happened once. I'm sorry, but... And it will not happen again. So go get the money now. -If you want us to play. -Stop it! Stop it! I mean, nobody's scamming us, babe. I swear. There are just 20 people out there, Mark. There is no money to see. Is that my fault? He's the promoter. He's supposed to bring people to our concerts. Hey, I'm working my ass off for this tour, and you know it. It's not working, mate. We're leaving. I'm not gonna play. You're an asshole. Javi, don't worry. You've done a great job. Move your fucking leg, man. What the fuck. What's going on here? We're leaving. This wanker's not doing well his job. Mark is doing his prima donna routine again. Shut up! Listen, man, This is the last concert of the tour. I don't care if nobody came, and I'm not gonna miss it because you're acting like a fucking jerk. So, wear your fucking guitar or I'll smack you. Don't you talk to me like that. What the fuck, man? We're gonna have fun tonight. You, Jane, and I are gonna climb the fucking stage, do our set and blow the brains out of the five dames waiting for us here. And you know what? After we finish, you and I are gonna get drunk until we forget our bloody names. Like the old times, man. Like the good times. Time to rock, motherfucker. You look like the new Lisa of them all. I'd rather be the new Sean Yseult, but thanks. I think you're way sexier than the White Zombie bassist. That's my opinion. Gross. I told you, motherfucker, this is gonna be fucking banging. Yeah, sort of. "Yeah, sort of." Fucking guy's unbelievable. Okay. I gotta take a leak. Coming right back. Good luck. You. A beer. Hello, baby. You are awesome. Am I? I mean you guys, the band. Oh, fuck, the band. I thought you meant me. Well, you did a good job tonight. Thank you. I think you might deserve a bonus. I would love to see what kind of bonus is that. You really want to see? I'm tired. Yes, it's pretty late, isn't it? Where's Billy Bob? He went to the bathroom, I think. There is the bastard. I think he got lucky. Well, look at that. Who's that slut? -Fuck, you're beautiful. -Well, thank you. Hey, guys, her town is very close by. We need to give her a lift. It's only 20 minutes from here. No, no, no, bro. Cut it. We're loading your stuff into the van. Now you want us to drive your hook-up home? Who are we, your au pair or something? Come on, man. Her car broke down. She's asking for a favor. She should take a cab then. I'm tired. You're being selfish. You just want to fuck her. You did the same when you went to fuck her, do you remember? -Hey! -You had too much coke. Yeah. So what? Guys, don't argue. Please. I can just walk. -No, no, it's not, baby. -Don't worry. No way that she's going alone, okay? Don't worry. I know you're a gentleman. Loved your show, guys. Please understand that it's nothing personal. We are really tired. We have a long journey to Buenos Aires. We are so sorry. Yeah, I know, But you had too much to drink. And you look pretty tired. I am tired. It's not safe to drive in that condition. Why don't you stay over at my place? It's a big country house, many rooms, cozy beds for everyone. My folks are making a big barbecue. They'd love to have you. That's not bad. Yeah. Fuck yeah. Okay, Jane? Fuck it. Let's do it. I'm vegan, but what the hell? Yeah. Whatever. Come on, baby. You're gonna love my uncle's barbecue. -Just wait. -All right, all right. I mean, we can't be going far, right? Hey... What was her name? Carla. Carla, is this the way? She sounds pretty busy. So what are we gonna do now? You go and ask them. Do your job, manager. And do your fucking job once. Hey, bitch! Where do you think you are? This ain't a fucking motel, okay? You brought us to your dirty shithole in the middle of fucking nowhere. And now you're acting like a filthy slut? What are you talking about? Don't take her side. Who knows the bugs you might be catching right now, you idiot! Shut up! And if you're gonna act like the cheap prostitute you are, you better get down off this bus or we'll fucking make you. Don't worry, Princess, I'm gone. Anything is better than to listen to that stupid, frigid voice of yours. You'll pay for this. What's wrong with you? Fucking idiots. What the fuck was that? We should get out of here. We're not gonna go without Billy. Fucking hell. They are not in the road anymore. Where did they go? So what do we do now? -We should go after him. -After him? -Yeah. -We have no idea where he went. And that asshole has to come back on his own. We can't leave him in the middle of nowhere with no cell phone. So what? -What are we gonna do? -Wait. -Mark. -Let me think. We're gonna wait him 30 minutes. Thirty minutes. If he doesn't show up, it's on you. Guys. Guys! Guys. What time is it? It's ten o'clock. -Oh, fuck. -Great. Oh... Let's go now. Please. This is strange, man. Maybe something did happen to Billy Bob. You've seen too many movies, bro. What was the name of the town we were heading to? Epecuen. Look. What happened here? A flood, like, three decades ago. I didn't know that. And the crazy bitch said she lived here? How is it even possible? It's a ghost town. Listen what I found here. "Epecuen was one of the most important touristic village of Argentina. "Thousands of people came here attracted by the healing properties "of its thermal waters. "On November 10th in 1985, "a huge volume of water broke the protecting embankment "and the village was submerged under the 10 meters of salt water. "And Epecuen disappeared. "Thirty years later, the waters receded "and the ruins of Epecuen emerged, "exposing a bleak and deserted landscape. "But the residents never returned." This place gives me the creeps. I don't think Billy is here. This place... Is surreal. You know what? Let's take a swim. -You're crazy, baby. -Crazy? It's pretty hot out here. Come on, it will be fun. Mm, I don't know. Honey... Let's get loose, swim or not. Okay. Let's do something useful. Let's go look for him. Hey, we're gonna go look for him that way. Okay, good luck with that. Asshole. Do you think Billy is here? I'm worried. I've got a bad feeling of this place. Don't think about that. I mean, he's probably fine with the girl. Just try to distract yourself. You have a boyfriend, right? Well, that came out of the blue. But no. We broke up before the tour. Turns out he was a jerk. That's great. I mean, it sucks. Actually, I've always wanted to travel the world. Get to know new places. New people. So stay... I mean, for a while. You're a great singer. I can manage you, and you can stay in my apartment. It's fun-- No, I'm sorry. You must think I'm a psychopath. I'm so... Who's that? I needed this so much. Aren't you warm? It's actually better than I thought. Told you. I am so sick and tired of Billy being... Billy. He's always pulling up his crap, and then we are left to clean up his mess. Don't you agree, babe? Babe? It's not funny! Mark? -Asshole. -It was a joke. It was a joke. -Asshole. -Calm down. Just a little bit of fun. He's using Billy's handkerchief. I told you, that you will regret this. What the hell did you do to our friend? Listen, listen. We did nothing to you. Just let us go. Run! Shit! I've got to take that call. It must be Javi. It must be Javi. Wait. Babe... Where the fuck are you? Billy? Billy? You came to finish what you started, hmm? You like seeing me putting my makeup on, don't you? Gets you so hard You are hurting me, babe! Help me, please. Take me out of here. My friends... The police... Policia? Policia. Take me, please. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? No, no, no, no, no. It's the other way. Let her go, you fucking pussy. You don't have balls to fight like a man, you fucking faggot! Let me out, and I'll kick your ass. Carla... Fucking piece of shit! He said that if you win one more fight, we'll let you all go. No! Gracias. Salud! Tito... Yeah. No! No, no, no... Mark! No, no, no, no! No! No, please... No... No! Hey. Hey. She's the dog. She's another victim of those freaks. Do you understand what I'm saying? They keep the woman alive. They would do that to me. Oh, God, no! I want to go home. I want to go home. I wanna go home. I wanna go home. Jane! Jane! Jane, you're loose. He forgot to lock you up. You need to get out of here right now. No, I'm not gonna leave you here. I'm not gonna leave you here. Those freaks are gonna kill you. They'll fucking kill you. I'll get you out of here. I'll get something to open this. Trust me. No! Please... Hey, you idiot! Yes, where you going? Look. I told you I would come back for you. What about the others? Sophie's dead. I don't know about Mark, but we need to get the fuck out of here. Those animals, they're killing each other. Oh, God. You and me getting out of here right now. Let him go, you monster. Let's make it even, piece of shit. Jane? Jane, Jane, Jane! The girl we saw... Take her away from here. Promise me. Promise me. I promise. It's okay. Don't be scared. Everything's fine. We're going home. We're leaving. Everything's over.
