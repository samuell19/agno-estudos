[knocking on door] It'’s open. Afternoon, Albert. Oh, hi, Pa. What'’re you doing home so early? Uh, Mr. Caldwell gave me the rest of the day off. See, he figured I might wanna come home and celebrate. -Celebrate? -Mm-hmm. Boy, you are looking at the new purchasing agent for J.R. Bennett and Company. Oh, Pa, that'’s great! Congratulations! Oh, hey, listen, that is not all. They'’re gonna send me back to Minnesota on a business trip for one month. For a month? Yeah. Yeah, I feel kind of bad about being away from you that long, but... I tell ya, I worked so hard to get this promotion, I... I just have to keep at it, you know? How would you like to go with me? How would I like it? Are you serious? -How would you like it? -But if you'’re gonna be gone for a month, Ma might need me-- I'’ve already talked to your ma, she was the one suggested you go with me. -Really? -Really. Now listen, we can spend some time at that university you'’re going to attend, look around, see what it'’s like, and then go on and spend some time at Walnut Grove. What do you say? So when do we leave? End of the week soon enough? Oh, Pa, thank you. All right, Isaiah, it'’s now or never. I know, I know. All right then, let'’s get him out. All right. All right. All right, let'’s go. [chattering] -Come on. Come on. -Come on. Come on. [chattering] Here comes the one. [man 1] Come on, Willie, you can do it. [cheering] Come on! Bring it in! -Bring it in! -[man 2] Come on! Bring it in! [man 3] Come on, Willie. Come on. [man 4] Come on! He'’s safe! Safe? Safe? How can you call him safe? He was out from me to you. Now, now, Isaiah, this was a, a close decision, but the good Lord helped me make the right decision. Well, that'’s wonderful, but the good Lord wasn'’t leading by two runs, we were! -Isaiah! This is Sunday! -Beautiful slide, Willie. Let'’s not question divine guidance. Let'’s go everybody, time to eat! Isaiah, I dropped the ball. Oh, if this would'’ve been Saturday, Willie would'’ve been out! Oh... Oh, John, the team was pretty lucky today. [chuckles] I don'’t know about that. Willie gave Isaiah'’s snake ball a pretty good lick. That was not my snake ball, but you can bet your boots it will be next time. Isaiah, are you telling me your team wants a rematch? Sure, why not? And I guarantee you things are gonna be different too. Well, well, gentlemen, it sounds to me like we have the basis for a possible wager here. Now, you'’re talkin' there, Monty. You put up the money and I'’ll put up my snake ball. -Uh-huh. -Snake ball? That'’s Mr. Montague, and I'’d hardly call your snake ball a sound investment. [laughing] We'’ll talk about this later. [chattering] Snake ball, snake ball. Kinda slithers up to the... Oh! [laughs] [chattering] Dear Lord, we thank you for this food that you'’ve given us and for this beautiful day so that we can enjoy the fellowship of our good friends. And we would also humbly ask your guiding hand to lead us and our neighbors through these most difficult times. These things we ask in Jesus name. -Amen. -Amen. I was talking to Brad Sutherland after services today. Did you know he was gonna sell off his place? Oh, no. I knew things were getting tough for him but Brad had his grain crop. Isaiah and me are all set to mill it for him. Yeah, it wouldn'’t have been much, but it would'’ve been enough to keep him goin'’. That'’s what he thought too, but... Well, he had an agreement with Zack Taylor to-to sell the crops together, but then Zack went ahead and sold his on his own. So, Brad was forced to sell at Zack Taylor'’s prices. -Right? -Yeah, exactly. Taylor has three times the property Brad has, why didn'’t he just wait for Brad to harvest? That'’s what he wanted to know. But when he went out to see him, Zack chased him off his property. I heard Mr. Oleson say Bobby Sutherland'’s moving away. So? So, it makes me feel bad. All my friends are moving away. And now I'’m wondering if we have to move away too. [bell tolling at a distance] Here are the records you requested, Mr. Hall. -Thank you, Mrs. McInnes. -Pardon me. Certainly. So, you want to be a doctor, Albert? -[Albert] Yes, sir. -Hmm. It'’s going to take a lot of hard work. Oh, I know that, sir, but that'’s my goal. I, uh, I hope to be able to go back home one day and become my town'’s doctor. Well, from what I see in this file, you take that goal very seriously. Mr. Ingalls, you have a very bright young man here. You should be proud. Thank you, sir, I am very proud. Oh, Albert, you'’ve got that nosebleed again, son. -Oh, no, not again. -Yeah. Excuse me, Mr. Hall, I'’ll go take care of this. -You want me to go with you? -No, I'’ll be fine. [Hall] The water closet is down the hall and to the right. Oh, thank you. That'’s the second one he'’s had, it must be the dry air, I'’m sorry. Oh, don'’t be sorry, I understand. Now then, Mr. Ingalls, here'’s the complete breakdown of the tuition fees plus the book and laboratory costs. Is there something wrong? Well, to be perfectly honest with you, Mr. Hall, the... the cost is just a lot more than I thought they were gonna be. [sighs] Mr. Ingalls, the study of medicine is not an inexpensive endeavor, but please remember the investment you make today will be more than returned once Albert becomes a doctor. Uh, do you mind? No, no, go right ahead. This may sound strange to you, Mr. Hall, but Albert wants to become a doctor so he can help people. I mean, when he opens his practice in Walnut Grove, more than likely his fees are gonna paid in chickens and bushels of apples. Well, the university has a number of philanthropic scholarships at its disposal. And it is possible with Albert'’s fine scholastic record that he could qualify for a partial if not complete scholarship grant. Well, that, that would be wonderful if you think he can do it. Well, when the Scholarship Committee convenes next week I shall give them my strongest recommendation. Albert is a fine student. And I think he'’ll make a very fine doctor. His mother and I feel the same way about it. Oh, here are some papers you need to fill out, perhaps I better go over them with you. For some reason, the Admissions Office makes forms that are only, um, understandable by those with a master'’s degree. I appreciate everything you'’re doing. Well, and I appreciate a young man like Albert wanting to help the people he grew up with. W-Where do we start? [chattering] Excuse me. Thank you. -Hey, how'’s your nose? -Oh, it'’s fine. What'’d you find out from Mr. Hall? Well, first thing I found out is your tuitions gonna cost about twice as much as we thought it was going to. Well, I can drop some classes, Pa, that'’ll help. Maybe get a job, maybe I'’d just better wait -till next year. -Albert, relax. Mr. Hall told me you got a good chance at getting a scholarship that'’ll help pay for most of it. -Pa, are you serious? -You'’re darn right I'’m serious. And I'’m hungry too. Come on, I'’ll tell you about it on the way. A scholarship! Can you believe it? -You think I have a chance? -Hey, you'’re an Ingalls. Of course, you got a chance. [chattering] Howdy, Jason. Hi. I lost my job today, Etta. Mr. Knudsen is gonna have to cut back to two days a week, so he had to let me go. Oh, Vance. At this rate, I'’ll still be tryin'’ to build us a house when I'’m 80. But I'’m still teaching. I mean, it may not pay much, but at least it'’s steady. No. Etta, when you said you'’d marry me, I promised to build you a house and that'’s what I'’m gonna do. We'’ll just have to postpone the wedding. I'’m sorry. Vance... I don'’t need you to build me a house. I'’d be just as happy living in a tent... as long as we'’re together, that'’s what really matters. I'’ll tell you what, I'’m gonna talk to Mr. Anderson over at the bank. Maybe he can loan me the money. [exhales] Jason, what are you doing? Quiet, Jeb, just go away. Jason, what are you looking at? I'’m watching Mr. Reed give Miss Plum a kiss, so I'’ll know how to do it right when I try it on Amy Bryant. Jason Carter, I wouldn'’t kiss you if you were the last boy on Earth! [screams] You see what you'’ve done? [Jeb] I haven'’t done anything. You did, too! You messed everything up. You heard her, she wouldn'’t kiss me if I was the last boy on Earth. And you believed that? You think she was lying? Of course, she was. Yeah. Sure, all you gotta do now is wait for all the rest of us to die. Thanks a lot, Jeb. The stage is comin'’! [horse galloping] -[laughs] Isaiah, how ya doing? -Oh, Charles. Oh, excuse me, I mean, Mr. Ingalls, sir. -Welcome to Walnut Grove. -What are you talkin'’ about? Well, Laura told me about your new job and I just wanted you to feel at home. I feel quite at home without all of that. Thanks. Ah, there'’s my granddaughter. -Hi, grandpa. -How you doing? Hi, Jenny. -Hi. -Look at you. Hi. -[Albert] Pa? -Yeah? Here, come on, the road was a little rough, feelin'’ queasy. You gonna be all right? Yeah, I think I just need some fresh air, is all. [Laura] Pa! -Oh, welcome home. -Hi, darlin'’. I just got off the phone with Ma. Aunt Rue had twins. -You kiddin'’? -A boy and a girl. Hey, your uncle'’s gonna be in shock. Hi, Laura. Hi, big brother. How do you feel? Well, right now I'’m a little tired. Well, I tell you what, why don'’t we go back to the house and you can rest while I make supper? That sounds very good to us. First it was the wheat, then it was the barley. Charles, the prices on all the crops have dropped to practically nothing. All the farmers, well, they'’re bitter and angry. It'’s just hard to believe things got so bad so quickly. I'’m tellin' you if it wasn'’t for that lumber contract with the army, the mill would be closed down, too. Mr. Ingalls, I have made a thumbnail assessment of the financial dilemma, which has befallen this town. And it is quite clear that the primary shippers have chosen to purchase goods from areas closer to the railroads. As I have told everyone, Walnut Grove simply cannot compete and expect to survive. Pa, with your new job, maybe you could do something? I don'’t know, darlin'. At least not until I get to talk to that shipper over in Redwood Falls. I tell you, Charles, anything you can do would be appreciated. I'’ll do what I can, you know that. Albert, Laura tells me that you have decided to study medicine. Yes, sir, that'’s right. Well, it is a commendable endeavor, and I wish you all the best. Thank you. I'’m sure I'll need it. Of course, first I have to get that scholarship. Yeah, we ought to know in about two weeks. I told them to contact us here. It seems like Laura'’s teaching must'’ve done some good after all, huh? [Isaiah] Tell you what you gotta do, Albert. Soon as you learn all that doctorin'’ stuff, you gotta get back here to Walnut Grove so Doc Baker can go fishin'’ with me all the time. I'’ll tell you, Mr. Edwards, when that happens, it will be a dream come true. I propose a toast, to the future Dr. Ingalls. May the medical challenge be easily attained. -[Isaiah] Here! Here! -[Charles] Here! Here! Jeb, can I ask you somethin'’? Sure. Have you ever kissed a girl? Yeah, lots of times. Listen, I'’m not talkin' about the goodbye kind of kiss, Jeb. I mean the real thing, you know, the "I like you" kind. If you'’re gonna put it like that, then I guess I'’ve only kissed two. Well, did they like it? I think one of them did, but not the other one. -How come? -[Sarah] Jeb, Jason! If you want breakfast, you'’d better hurry! -Comin'’, Ma! -[Jason] Wait a minute. Didn'’t the other girl like you kissin'’ her? I don'’t know. Come on, Jason, or the eggs will get cold. This is more important than eggs. We'’re talkin' kissin'’! [chuckles] Jason, will you just forget about it? Amy Bryant already told you she ain'’t gonna kiss you. Well, so what? I'’ll kiss someone else. I don'’t care who it is. Dag burn it! I'’ll be an old man before I get any kissin'’. [Montague chanting] Mr. Montague? Um, I'’m sorry to disturb you, but I just wanted to tell you-- [Montague] Then don'’t. [chanting] Well, I-I just wanted to tell you that breakfast is ready. Today is the 12th! Must I remind you of the significance of that date? Oh, your fast, I'’m sorry, I forgot. It'’s too late! [chanting] Well, I'’m afraid Mr. Montague has started his fast, -so he won'’t be joining us for a while. -[Montague chanting] Wh-wh-what'’s that noise? That'’s Mr. Montague. Uh, he has a few unusual habits. Unusual? I call it downright strange! -Now, Mr. Edwards, you be nice. -Well, I am bein'’ nice. Charles, don'’t you think it'’s a little peculiar for a man to get up every mornin'’, stand on his head in the corner and howl like a coyote? Well, just off hand, I'’d say that was odd. [laughing] I went to wake up Albert, but he'’s fast asleep. Hm, he didn'’t get much sleep on the train and that stagecoach ride was pretty hard on him. Well, I'’ll just let him sleep as long as he wants then. Charles, if you want to stop and see Nels before we go, we had better get to movin'’. -[Charles] All right. -Get your books, Jenny. -Good day. -You too. Hey, Charles, think you'’ll be back by Sunday? Sure. Why? Well, we got this here baseball game after the services and I thought maybe you could play on my team. Albert can play for John Carter'’s. It sounds like fun, we'’ll be there, gimme a kiss. -I'’m gonna walk you out. -All right. Hey, we'’ll see you in a couple of days. Have a good trip. [Montague chanting] We need to set some traps around here. [muttering] Fourteen, no, 15 cans of peaches. Well, that'’s it. Let'’s see how we did last month. [Charles] Mornin'’, Nels. Charles! Hey, how are ya? It'’s good to see you. -You'’re looking well. -Oh, it'’s good to see you. -You look very well yourself. -Why thank you. Laura told me that you and Albert were coming. Oh, Charles, Rachel. Rachel, this is Charles Ingalls. It'’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Ingalls. Willie has told me so much about you and Albert. I feel like I know you both already. Well, thank you. I must say, Willie married himself a very, very lovely bride. If you'’ll both excuse me, I'’ll go help Willie open the restaurant. All right. Pleasure to meet you. Uh, it'’s hard to believe, Willie married. [Nels] Yeah, it sure is. -Where'’s the missus? -Oh, on her way to St. Louis. She left two days ago. We have some land down there and Harriet went down to see if she could sell it. We'’re pretty much down to empty pockets. You and everybody else in town. Charles! The stage is comin'’! I'’m heading over to Redwood Falls. Gonna meet Otis Wagner, he does a lot of shipping for our company. You wouldn'’t know him, would you? Yeah, I know Otis, shrewd businessman. -But he is honest. -I'’m glad to hear that. Maybe we can get some business goin'’ around here. -[Nels] Oh, Lord, I hope so. -I'’ll see you on Sunday. [Nels] You bet. [exhales] [knock on door] Come in. Oh, I'’m glad to see you finally woke up. Oh, I didn'’t realize I slept so late. What time is it? It'’s almost noon. You look kinda pale, are you feeling all right? I feel so tired. I guess it'’s all the excitement from the trip and getting to visit the university is all. Well, how about some breakfast or I should say lunch? No, I'’m really not very hungry, Laura. Tired, not hungry. What'’s city life done to you, boy? [chuckles] I don'’t know. Well, I tell you what, I'’m gonna go downstairs and pack us a nice picnic lunch. I think a little fresh country air is exactly what you need. -I'’d like that. -Good. You come down when you'’re ready. Okay. [sighs] [chattering] Oh, well, thank you, Jason. It'’ll keep the growls away until I can get back to the mill. Mr. Edwards, you probably know quite a bit about kissin'’ girls. -Don'’t you? -Kissin'’? Jason, ain'’t you kinda young to be thinkin'’ about a thing like that? Oh, uh, I wasn'’t askin' for me. It'’s for my friend. -He'’s older, but kinda shy. -Oh, oh. Well, it'’s pretty much up to the individual but mostly you just pucker up, smack '’em on the lips. Do you keep your eyes open or closed? Well, the ladies, they like to close their eyes, -see, but I keep mine open. -Why? Mainly '’cause my aim ain'’t too good, see, and I don'’t wanna to wind up kissin'’ 'em on the nose. Especially, if they got a cold. [laughs] Yeah, that makes sense, all right. Pucker up, smack '’em on the lips, eyes open. I got it, thanks! [chuckles] I loved coming here when we were kids. It'’s still so peaceful. Yeah, well, nothing'’s changed. Fish still aren'’t biting. [laughs] Do you, do you remember when we told Willie that we had a family secret for catching fish? [chuckles] Do I? Do you remember he spent the entire summer trying to figure out what that secret was and he was so mad when he found out -that it was just cheese! -It was just cheese. [both laughing] Gosh, it was fun growing up here. Oh, yeah. [sighs] Sometimes I wish I was still a little girl. Laura, are you happy here? I mean, now that you'’re married and you have Rose? Yeah, I'’m very happy. If I had it my way I'’d stay here the rest of my life. Me, too. I'’m going to school to become a doctor, but I want to come back here. This is where life seems the best, not in the city where no one has time for one another. Will the future Dr. Ingalls be giving my family a discount? Oh, of course, you can pay me one chicken instead of two! [laughs] Oh, no! This always seems to happen at the wrong time. Here. Do you get these often? Yeah, it seems like every darn day lately. [sighs] I used to get '’em when I was little. I guess it'’s just a phase that all kids go through. Kids? I'’m about to start medical school. Well, then, physician, heal thyself. I'’m gonna go catch a fish. As you can see, Mr. Ingalls, everything is shipped right on schedule. I'’ve been doing business with Bennett and Company for over five years and I'’d like to think we have a good relationship. Well, that goes without saying, Mr. Wagner, you'’re probably the most reliable of all our shippers. Why, thank you. I do try to run a smooth operation here. Mr. Wagner, I'’m curious as to why your agents stopped buying from the farmers around Walnut Grove? -May I call you Charles? -Certainly. Charles, ever since the railroad put in its new spur line, we'’ve had our business practically double. I mean, take your company, you can see for yourself the amount of goods we ship just to you. I know that, but you'’re shipping the same things those farmers raise. Yes, and I have to say that the quality is much better than I'’m buying now, but the problem is that the farms around Walnut Grove are just too small. From the amount of goods I need to fill my customer'’s orders, I have to deal with the large farms who can deliver. [scoffs] I guess that'’s what people call progress. I'’m afraid it is. Well, we'’ll be going. It'’s a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Wagner. -Please, call me Otis. -All right, Otis. I'’m gonna be leaving for Walnut Grove in the morning. I'’ll see you on my next visit. Very well, have a good trip. I sure will, thank you. [clock ticking] Time'’s up. Pass your tests to the center. Now, then, I'’d like to remind you all that our annual field trip will be at the end of the month. Please make sure that you have selected a subject for your nature projects by then. Yes, what is it, Nancy? Miss Plum, I just wanna know if the whole class has to make that silly climb up to Harper'’s Bluff again? Yes, I think it'’s a tradition that everyone looks forward to. Well, not me. -Nancy. -Yes, Amy. Ma'’am, I wasn'’t here last year, and what'’s Nancy talkin'’ about? Well, Amy, each year at the end of the field trip, we all climb up to the top of Harper'’s Bluff. And you take along a keepsake to put in the strongbox that'’s buried there. -[Amy] But what for? -That'’s what I keep asking. You see, Amy, it all started about ten years ago when a group of children found some old Indian artifacts up there. They thought it would be a good idea to leave something of their own, you know, something for those who come later to remember them by. Oh, I think that'’s a wonderful idea. Well, so do we, and that'’s why we're gonna climb up there again. -Right, children? -[all] Right! [Etta] All right, children, it'’s time for lunch. [all] Yeah. Hi, how you doin'’? -Hi. -Hi. -Hi, Albert. -Hi! -Jeb, how you doin'’? -[Jeb] See you in baseball then. -[Albert] Okay, after lunch. -[Jeb] Okay. Albert! Hi, Miss Plum. -How are you? -I'’m fine, just fine. Uh, I just wanted to come by and say hello to everybody. Well, I'’m glad you did. It'’s good to see you. Hello, Albert. Hi. Michele? Michele Pierson? Uh-huh, the one and only. The last time I saw you-- Probably wearing dirty overalls, cutting down wheat alongside my two brothers, right? Right. Miss Plum, Nancy took the ball again and stuffed it down her dress. Now we can'’t use it. I'’m coming. Will you be visiting a while, Albert? Yes, ma'’am, my pa and I will be here for about a month. Oh, good, I look forward to seeing him, too. Well, if you'’ll excuse me, my favorite student needs some attention. -Well, how have you been? -How'’s life in the city? [chuckles] All right, um, I'’ll answer first. I'’m fine. Now it'’s your turn. Oh, it'’s not bad, but I'’d much rather be living here. How'’s that? [laughs] Just fine. You really have changed. Oh, gosh, I didn'’t realize I looked so bad. Oh, no, that'’s not what I meant. I meant you really look nice. You know, your dress and all that. Oh, thank you. I guess I just figured it was time to start being a girl. And since I'’ll be going to college I better look like I belong there. You mean you'’ll be going to the university? Uh-huh, I want to be a teacher, so I'’ve been helping Miss Plum here a few days a week, you know, just to get the feel of things. Oh, that'’s nice. You know, I'’ll be starting at the university myself. I want to become a doctor. Oh, a doctor! Albert, that'’s wonderful! Oh, my gosh, maybe we'’ll be seeing... I mean... I'’ll probably see you there once in a while. Yeah, I'’m sure you will. Well, I'’d better go. It sure was nice to see you again, Michele. Yeah, it was nice to see you, too, Albert. Michele, I'’m going to a picnic and baseball game on Sunday after church. If you'’re not busy, would you like to go? Why, yes. Yes, I'’d like that very much. Well, great! I'’ll see you on Sunday then. Yeah, see you on Sunday. [knock on door] -Yes, who is it? -[Charles] Otis, it'’s me, Charles Ingalls. Charles, come in, I thought you'’d left for Walnut Grove. No, no, I don'’t leave until the morning. Could I talk to you for a minute? Why, certainly, come in, sit down. Ah, I just made some fresh coffee, would you like a cup? Yeah, that sounds good, thank you. -How do you take it? -Just black. I was hoping you'’d still be here. Oh, yes, I usually am. In fact, my wife is threatening to move my bed in here. Otis, let me tell you why I'’m here. I was thinking about what you were saying this afternoon about not being able to buy from the farms around Walnut Grove because they'’re so small. It can'’t be helped, Charles. As it is, I kept on buying from them long after the other shippers stopped. I know that, Otis, I found out and I appreciate it. But let me ask you this, what if I can get those farmers to work together, form a co-op? Could you buy their goods then? [sighs] This is something I thought about myself, but as far as I can see it, it won'’t work. Why not? You already told me you preferred their products to anybody else'’s. Yes, I know, but the price I'’d have to pay your people in order for them to make a profit would just be unrealistic. Why, they can'’t compete with the larger outfits. They buy their seed in quantity. They use the most modern machinery. What do we do, just write '’em off? I mean, they'’ve worked their whole lives for these farms. Look, suppose I can-- suppose I can sell you those goods for the same price you'’re paying now, delivered here. Why, you don'’t realize what you'’re saying, Charles. Your people will be working for, at the very most, just a few pennies. Well, what do they have now? They have nothing. Come on, Otis, try it. What do you say? All right, I'’ll buy their goods, but you have to guarantee that Bennett and Company supports this deal one hundred percent. I guarantee it. Well, I hope you can make it work. Well, so do I. I'’ll be in touch with you. [cheering] I must say they'’re really taking this game very seriously. You'’re telling me, it'’s all I've heard about the last two weeks. Well, you know what they say, boys will be boys. [all chuckle] We'’re losing. [man 2] Come on, Isaiah! [cheering] Too bad. Out! -I got it. Mine. -I got it! I got-- Watch it! What? Don'’t you... Get off. -Will you get off-- -I had the ball... [men clamoring] Come on, John, pitch it. [chattering] [cheering] [man 3] Safe! -Go ahead, Jason. -It'’s all right, Jason, go. [chattering] Batter up! Albert, we got two men on, give it a ride, it'’s up to you. -Go get him, Albert. -Come on, Albert. [chattering] -Oh, all right! -Strike one! -[man 3] Albert. -[man 4] Come on, Albert. Bring it home. All right, Albert, here it comes. [man 5] Hit the ball. Hit the ball. All right, Albert, look out. The old snake ball is ready to bite. What a hit! Way to hit it, Albert. Come on, Bobby. Go! Come on, Albert. Come on. He'’s out! [shouting] We did it. [Jeb] Something'’s wrong with Albert! Albert? Hey, Albert? Son, what'’s wrong? How do you feel now, Albert? Kinda numb. You had this before, blackin'’ out, I mean? No. Well, he has been havin'’ some nosebleeds and he'’s been feelin' kinda tired lately. How often has he had '’em? [Charles] Well, let'’s see, he had one on the train, then another one when we were at the university. And when we were at the pond the other day, he had one, too. It was kinda bad. [Isaiah] Had one at the mill yesterday. Charles, I think you ought to take him to the hospital in Mankato. Mankato? What do you think is wrong, doc? I'’m not sure, but they're much better equipped to diagnose Albert'’s problem than I am. I'’d only be guessing. Oh, it'’s just a couple of nosebleeds. I don'’t need a hospital. Albert, it wouldn'’t hurt for '’em to take a look at you. Doctor Houser is the Chief of Staff over there. And he'’s an old colleague of mine. I'’ll call and set things up for you. Appreciate it. We'’re ready to leave anytime. Charles, I'’ll drive you. I'’ll have the wagon ready in no time. Thank you. Pa, do we have to go? I mean, all this fuss over some nosebleeds? Hey, come on. You just do what the doc tells you. When you become a doctor, you don'’t wanna have the patients ignorin'’ your advice, do you? No, sir. Here we go again. Oh. Here are the last two, doctor. Huh? Oh. Thank you. Thank you very much. Dr. Houser, were you able to find out what'’s wrong with Albert? Yes. Yes, we were. Why don'’t we all sit down? Mr. Ingalls... Albert is a very sick young man. Uh, I'’m afraid he has a blood disorder which is... Well, it'’s causing him to lose strength. Oh, I see. Well, h-how long? I mean, how long will the treatments take before you can get him back on his feet? Mr. Ingalls, I'’m sorry, but, uh... Well, there is no treatment. Albert'’s not going to get any better... only worse. Wait a minute, doc. Are you, you tellin'’ us Al-Albert can'’t be helped? Yes, that'’s right. But I-I don'’t understand. I mean... He, he was fine up until yesterday. I mean, he'’s-he's been a little bit tired and all... Mr. Ingalls, uh... you see, Albert has had this problem for a long, long time. And, uh, well, we'’re just now beginning to see the signs because, uh, it is getting progressively worse. Wait, wait a minute. Uh... Wait a minute. The, uh... This-this blood disorder you'’re talkin' about, uh... I don'’t know if I told you, but-but Albert had a... he had a, he had a problem with morphine a little while back and, and I think that... that this is probably just an aftermath of that... [Houser] I don'’t think so. I'’ve seen this disease in infants as well as adults. What do you mean you'’ve seen it before? You'’re supposed to be a doctor. You know what it is, do something about it! Mr. Ingalls, I'’ve told you-- I don'’t care what you told me! You'’re a doctor! You went to school to learn how to save lives! Save my son! I can'’t. I can'’t. [sobbing] How long does my son have? It could be any time. There'’ll be days when he'’ll be just fine, full of life... and then he'’ll weaken again. That'’s usually a sign that the end is near. Have you told him? [Houser] No. [whimpers] [sighs] [sniffles] Can I, uh... Can I go see him now? Certainly. Mr. Ingalls... would it be easier if I told him? Easier for who? Did you reach '’em? I couldn'’t get a hold of Caroline. I told Laura. He'’s been asleep ever since you left. [Albert] I'’m not asleep. [thunder rumbling] Can I get you anything? A glass of water, my mouth'’s real dry. There you go. Thanks. I talked to Laura. She and Almanzo are making plans to come and see you before I take you home. Pa, I'’ve been thinkin'. I want to go home... but I don'’t want to go home to Burr Oak. I want to go home to Walnut Grove. Walnut Grove? But you, you ought to be home with the family. Pa, just hear me out. I'’ve been trying to think what I'’d like to do with the time I got left. You know, seein'’ some of the places I'’ve read about. Even goin'’ to sea. But my mind keeps goin'’ back to Walnut Grove. But what-what about your ma? I'’ve been thinkin' about that, too. I'’ve been thinkin' about Ma and my brother and my sisters. Pa... I don'’t want 'em to watch me die. That'’s all they'd be doin'’, watchin'’ it happen. They wouldn'’t be able to do anything about it. I mean, it'’s better for them. Albert, believe me they want you to be with them. But I don'’t want 'em to be. I don'’t have, I don'’t have much time left. I want to spend it doin'’ as many things as I can. The things I used to do when I was a kid. I know it sounds selfish. But it'’s my last chance. Albert, I unders... I understand how you feel. Pa, you don'’t understand how I feel. No one understands how I feel but me. I know you'’re tryin' to, but you don'’t know. I'’m going to die, Pa. Don'’t you think it should be my right to say what I want to do with the rest of my life? Hm? Yeah. [sobbing] Yeah. But I don'’t know what to tell your ma. I'’ll tell her. I'’ll call her in the morning. Take me back to Walnut Grove, Pa. I became Albert Ingalls there. Remember? Take me back. Let me go back there and stay there forever. Please, Pa. Okay? -Hmm? -Yeah. [Charles crying] [sobbing] [sniffles] I got worried when I woke up and didn'’t see you. [sniffles] I found these today... [sniffles] when I was packing for the trip. Albert and I made them for each other a long time ago. [sniffles] [sighs] I remember we were 11 or 12... and we wanted to start a club. There was me and Albert and Willie... and another boy named Andrew Garvey. And we made these leather badges for each other. [sniffles] And then each one of us cut our fingers. Not much, just enough to get some blood. And then we put our fingers together. And became blood brothers. [chuckles] All except Willie. [sniffles] As soon as he saw all the blood, he fainted. [chuckles] That sounds like Willie. [sighs] [sniffles] It seems like yesterday. Beth, why don'’t you come back to bed? I'’ll heat up some milk, it'’ll help you sleep. No. I'’d just like to sit here by myself, if that'’s all right? Sure. I love you. [crying] [horses snorting] Personal profile seem to be the most popular, so I felt we should put the one about your pa right next to the announcement for the town meeting. You know, to remind people to be sure and come. That'’s a good idea. Um, we can'’t forget Jeanie Galiher'’s new baby. I promised her we'’d put an announcement in, too. Oh, of course. I'’ll add it on to the back page. Laura... I can finish this if you want. No. No, thanks. It helps keeping busy. You know, I keep thinking this is all just a dream and I'’m just gonna wake up and... I know. Jeb and Jason haven'’t really known Albert that long, but it didn'’t make it any easier to tell them. You know, I think children can understand when someone old is dying, but to see someone like Albert... [Jenny] Aunt Laura! Aunt Laura, Mr. Edwards'’ wagon is coming up the road! Mr. Carter'’s out front. He drove me home. Oh. Aunt Laura. What will I say? I don'’t know what to say. [horse carriage rattling] Let'’s go. [crying] Come on, now, be strong. Be strong, you promise me? -Here you go. -Easy. How have you been, Mr. Carter? Just fine. How about yourself? Well, I have had some better days. Well, big sister, I'’m home to stay if you'’ll have me. [crying] It'’s all right. Go ahead and cry. You'’ve gotta promise me, after today, no more tears around me, all right? Okay? I promise. Well, I'’m gonna go and get some sleep. Laura, Mr. Edwards must have hit every rut between here and Mankato. Here, now, don'’t go blamin' me. I didn'’t start drivin' till we were more than halfway home! [chuckles] Mr. Carter... Mr. Edwards has agreed to give our team a rematch. What do you say? We'’ll do it. Snake ball and all! Come on. I can'’t believe it. Now the boy wants to play baseball. He just wants us to treat him like nothin'’ happened. And that'’s what we'’re gonna do. That'’s what we're gonna do. [chattering] [door opens] [Charles] Now listen to me. Now listen to me for one minute, just hear me out. Believe me, it'’ll work. It'’ll work. All we have to do is combine our labor, everybody contributes, everybody benefits. And we take one man'’s team, we put it with another farmer'’s unused plow. The same with the seed. Some of you need a little bit, some of you need a lot. We buy it collectively. We save money. For the first time, you gotta be competitive with the big outfits. Mr. Ingalls... everything you'’ve said seems to make sense, but what about our profit? How much is everybody goin'’ to be able to make? Well, I'’m afraid not a lot in the beginning. At least, not until we can get a guaranteed contract from the shipper in Redwood Falls. [chattering] Mr. Ingalls. Mr. Ingalls. I read in here in the bulletin about your new job and your plan to help us. And what some of us would like to know is what'’s in all this for you? [chattering] Excuse me. -Sit down. -Wait, hold it. Excuse me. I don'’t think we've met. The name'’s Taylor. Zack Taylor. All right, Mr. Taylor, would you believe me if I told you absolutely nothing? Not one red cent. Can'’t say as I would. You see, I wasn'’t around this country back when you were such a vital part of this community. All right, now, hold on. Charles here is trying to help us. Of course, we all know you don'’t need any help, so why don'’t you just leave? Isaiah, it'’s all right. Sit down. Sit down. Uh, Mr. Ingalls, I remember you as being a good man. If, indeed, you are here trying to help, why can'’t you just pay each of us who have the crops a fair price and let it go at that? Because it'’s not my money to pay. Look, I'’m just tryin' to show all of you how to get back on your feet until things get better. That'’s all I can do. I still say he'’s with them, the city buyers, makin'’ the price so low that you'’re gonna steal the profit! -[man 5] Yeah. -[man 6] Yes, he is! [chattering] What is wrong with you people? What'’s happened to all of you? Just who are you to ask that kind of question? My name'’s Albert Ingalls. The man who'’s trying to help you is my father. Well, that don'’t make you something special. Go on back to the big city with your old man. We don'’t need no kid not grown tellin'’ us what for. Come back in ten years when you'’re a man! [all laugh] That'’s enough, Zachary. [chattering] [man 7] You got that? Quiet! Quiet a minute, I say! Zack Taylor, that boy that just walked out of here is more of a man than you'’ll ever be. And he cares a hell of a lot more about this town. You see, he remembers it when it was a town full of friends and neighbors who really cared about each other, who were willing to work together, no matter how tough it got. And you told him to come back here when he'’s a man. Well, you see, he can'’t do that... '’cause he's dyin'’. But he came back here because of all the places in the world, this place, this town is where he want to spend his last days. And you all think you got it tough. I'’m just sorry he saw what happened to this town. Edwards... I'’d like to take part in Charles'’ plan. -[man 8] Yeah! -[man 9] Good for you, Zachary! Let'’s take a vote. All right, all in favor? [all] Aye! Aye! Aye! All opposed? All right. By God, we got us a town again. -Good mornin'’. -[Laura] Good morning. Morning? -I dare say it'’s past noon. -It is? Hmm. I wanted to go back out and help with the farm. Why didn'’t somebody wake me up? Why, I asked Pa not to. I didn'’t think you needed to be in that hot sun. It'’s really not that bad. I enjoy working and talking with everybody. Albert, you'’ve got to get some rest! Why is it that you have to be doing something all the time? If both of you will excuse me, I have to get these chapters on the afternoon stage. Mr. Montague, would you mind giving me a ride into town? [Montague] Why, no, not at all. I'’ll bring the buggy around to the front. [sighs] Laura... the things I want to do I can'’t put off until tomorrow. Pa understands that. I just wish you could. -[door opens, closes] -[sighs] Albert. -Wheat. -Mm-hmm. Barley, and corn. All right, that'’s all of 'em. Thanks, Jenny. All right, class. Everyone back to your seats. Albert! Hi. I hope I'’m not disturbing anything. [Etta] No, not at all. It'’s so good to see you. We just finished making plans for our field trip. Oh, really? That'’s nice. Oh, does the class still make that climb up to the Keepsake Tree? Oh, yes. In fact, we just finished making our keepsake. Class, does anyone want to tell Albert what we decided to put in the strongbox this year? [Etta] Amy. Well, we all thought since the town was starting a new community farm, it might be nice if the keepsake were some seeds from each of the crops. Well, yeah. That is very nice. -Miss Plum? -Yes, Nancy. [Nancy] Could I ask Albert a question? [chuckles] Certainly. What'’s it like knowing you'’re going to die? -Nancy! -Nancy! Nancy, I don'’t think that'’s any of your business! Oh, it'’s all right, Miss Plum. I don'’t mind talking about it. Well... [chuckles] Well... [sighs] Well, at first, I... I was scared... and angry. But, you know, once I started to think about my life... I found that I had made myself some really wonderful memories. You know, things that I had done. All the good times. All the good friends. And, you know, the best thing about it all... is that they all took place right here. And that'’s why I came back. '’Cause there's no better place on God'’s Earth. Just don'’t waste the time you have on it. All of you. Just go out and have a good time. Make yourself lots of good friends. You see, that way... you see, that way, when it'’s your time to look back and find your memories, you'’ll see that you won't be scared or angry either. That was a real fine supper, Michele. Your ma sure can cook. I'’m sorry, I couldn'’t eat much. Oh, that'’s all right, but she doesn'’t get all the credit. I made the dessert. [chuckles] Well, it was really good. The sky sure is pretty tonight, isn'’t it? Yeah, it sure is. Albert, uh... you know... I had a dream about you and I. You had a dream about us? Yeah. It was just a silly dream. Well, come on. Tell me about it. No, you'’ll just laugh and think I'’m really silly. Michele, I promise I won'’t. Cross my heart and hope to die. Why do you joke about it? Why not? All right. Now, come on, tell me about your dream. [sighs] Well... we were sitting out here, just like now and... I said how beautiful the sky was. And then you turned my head and I saw you smiling at me. Then you took my hands... and then you pulled me close to you. And you kissed me. [chuckles] See, I... I told you it was stupid. Just go ahead and laugh if you want to. Michele, I'’m not going to laugh. Especially not at you. I don'’t know how to say all this... but I'’ve been doing some dreaming about you, too. And... the thing is, I haven'’t got much time to do everything just proper. You know, the courtin'’ kind of stuff? So... Albert... I'’m so glad you came back to Walnut Grove. I am, too. [door closes] -Albert, is that you? -Yeah, Pa. -I'’m sorry I'm so late. -That'’s all right. Your sister was upset. She got mad at me for letting you out alone. [chuckles] I wasn'’t alone. Have yourself a good time over at Michele'’s? Oh, yeah. I sure did. What'’d you two do? Oh, we just sat on her porch. Just talkin'’. And you know, things like that. [chuckles] It sounds like you made yourself another nice memory. Yeah, I sure did. It'’s been the best one yet. [chuckles] Hey, wait a minute. A letter came for us today. Thought you might want to take a look at it. "Therefore, we proudly award you a four-year academic scholarship to the University of Minnesota School of Medicine." I made it. -I made it! -You'’re darn right you did. You know somethin'’... I really think I would have made a fine doctor. I know you would. I want to tell you something. You'’ve been the greatest son a man could ever have, I'’ll tell you. You weren'’t a bad pa yourself. I can'’t believe you're going along with this. Laura, he'’s going on a field trip. It'’s no different than anything else he'’s been doing. Yeah, well, I guess it'’s all right then. I mean, if Albert wants to play baseball, then it'’s fine. If it'’s working at the farm, or going to Michele'’s house till all hours of the night everyone just smiles and wishes him well. These are the things he wants to do. You know that. Pa, you'’ve seen him. He looks so weak. He needs to get some rest. Why? Well, I guess it doesn'’t matter what I have to say. I mean, if it'’s climbin' up to the Keepsake Tree, if Albert wants to do, then he'’s just gonna go right ahead and do it. All right, what is it you want me to do? I want you to tell him that he cannot climb up that mountain! Laura, Albert is going to die. I know that. Why are you telling me that? Then let him spend the time he has left doing what he wants to do. If you had it your way, he'’d spend the rest of his life in bed. Well, why not? It'’s better than watching him drain himself. Better for him or better for you? Come on, Laura. Let me hear you say it. "My brother is going to die. " Come on, no more pretending. Say it. "My brother is going to die." Let me hear it. I can'’t. You can. -I can'’t-- -Now, come on and say it. -No. -"My brother is going to die. " -Come on, say it. -No. Say it. -I... -Say it. I can'’t. [sobs] My-My-My-My-My... My brother is going... is... is gonna die. Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! [crying] Oh, my God, he'’s gonna die. [crying] He'’s gonna die. Ah, there you go. It doesn'’t seem to be stopping, Mr. Ingalls. Yeah, I know, Hold this against it, son. Maybe we ought to get you back home. Oh, no, Pa. It'’ll stop. Just give it time. I'’m glad you came. -Are you all right? -Mm-hmm. See, Pa, I told you it'’d stop. Now, you'’re not out here just to worry, are you? No, and I brought you these. Oh, my gosh, Laura. Where'’d you ever find them? They were in one of my trunks. [Laura] Do you remember when we made those? Oh, do I? Are you kidding? I remember Willie, uh, fainted because we all cut our fingers. [both laugh] I thought you might like to put '’em up in the strongbox at the Keepsake Tree. I love you. I love you, too. Albert! We'’re going up the hill now! Miss Plum asked if you'’d lead the way and put our keepsake in the strongbox. Oh, you bet I will. Are you sure you can make it, son? -Yeah, I think I can, Pa. -I know he can! '’Cause I'm going to be with you all the way to the top. Are you serious? Oh, we did it once a long time ago and we'’re going to do it again today. You'’re not the only one reliving old memories, Albert Ingalls. -[chuckles] Okay. -Come on. [Etta] Come on, children. Let'’s get going. -[boy 1] Yeah, let'’s go! Come on! -[boy 2] Come on! Well, they reached the halfway point. How'’s Albert doin'? He looks to be doin'’ all right. [sighs] Laura... I think I'’d better rest a while. [sighs] That'’s fine with me, Albert. Take all the time you need. [sighs] I don'’t remember it being this hard to climb. [both sigh] Yeah, but... that was before you became an old married woman. Very funny. [both laugh] [boy 3] Come on! Are we gonna let those young'’uns catch up to us? Not if we can help it. [breathing heavily] Let'’s go. They'’re movin' again. [groans] Well, that boy of yours sure is somethin'’. He sure is. [breathing heavily] [panting] [breathing heavily] Go on, Albert. Go on. [panting] Go on. [Isaiah] He made it! He made it! [laughing] [Almanzo] They made it! Phew! [sniffles]
