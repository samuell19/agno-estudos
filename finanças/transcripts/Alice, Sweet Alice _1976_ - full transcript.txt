It's so good to see you. Mommy said you wanted to see me. Oh, did she now? And now, why would I wanna see ya? You know. And did you make a good confession? Oh yes Father. Do you have a present for me? Of course I do, in the dinning room. (rattling) Did you find it? Where? Here, here, some of Mrs. Tredoni's delicious cookies. Sit down. Are you sure this is my present? Alice, why don't you sit down? No thanks Father Tom. I have to go to the bathroom. It's alright sweet heart, go ahead, you know where it is. (eerie music) Oh! You nasty child, out of my kitchen. (clack) Take that thing of your face. Who said you could go wandering around? I thought you had to go to the bathroom? I'm sorry Mrs. Tredoni. You probably frightened her half to death. Now go inside and sit down and try to act like a lady. Tom, I'm sorry. It's alright, I'm sure she didn't mean any harm. Karen, open your present, we all wanna see what it is. (inhales) [Mom] Oh, it's beautiful. Belonged to my mother. Oh Tom, you shouldn't have. What if she loses it? Who else would I give it to Cait? I love you Father Tom, I really love you. I know you'll take good care of it. Just lovely. (suspicious music) (dog barking) (eerie music) [Girl] Mommy, mommy. Alice? Alice? (clacking) Mommy, mommy, mommy. What is it? What did she do to you now? (sobbing) Are you alright? She took it, she's going to break it. I had it all to myself and she took it. What did she take? She took my doll, the doll daddy sent me. She's going to break it, I know she is. No she won't, I promise you she won't break it. Honey, I have to get to Cela's before they close. You want me to get your dress don't you? Yes. Okay.

(squeaking) Mommy says you're to come home right this instant. Give me my doll back. Where are you? Why are you running away from me? (suspenseful music) (screaming) [Alice] Didn't I tell you never to follow me? Where's my doll? (bang) No, no, let me out. Let me out. Let me out, let me out. (bangs) If you tell mommy about this you're never gonna see that doll again now go home. (eerie piano music) (footsteps tapping) [Mom] Where's your sister? Oh she's coming mom, my dress. Where have you been going Alice? Don't think you can keep things from me. You're not gonna get away with this. Why should you care where I do? I'm not Karen. I want the table set immediately. I don't like this new habit of yours disappearing when you're told to do something. You're old enough to know better. Sometimes I think you don't care about anybody but yourself. She's ruining my veil, make her take it off. Take your sister's veil off. Make her take it off mommy. Alice. Take your old veil, I don't want that stupid thing anyway. Alice, what's wrong with you sister, sister? I don't understand you. It's ruined. It's ruined. It's ruined. Alright. See, nothing happened to it. (coughing) Oh, you look beautiful, go look. You're gonna be the prettiest girl there. Wait 'til Father Tom sees you. * Fish got to swim * Birds got to fly * I got to love one man 'til I die * Can't help lovin' that man of mine (violin music) Are momma's little babies hungry?

Angela, go find Alice, take your coat with ya. Annie, it is not necessary, I was just out there and she's not there. Well, where can she be? I don't know. Alright girls, let's get ready now. Straighten up now, all your veil's straight? [Person] Psst. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.

She's got no business up there, for God sake, go get her. (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (bang and screaming) Oh my God, where's Angela? (crowd talking) Please be calm, there's nothing to worry about. Keep calm everyone, please. (screaming) Oh my God, ah. Where were you? I want a communion mommy, Father wouldn't give me the... Let's find Karen. [Father] Sister. (crowd screaming) (bang) Let me go to her. No, no. Let me go, get out of the way. Where did you get that veil? I found it on the floor when I came in. Is that Karen's veil? Where is she? I was gonna give it to her. Come on. Catherine. No, I don't want to. What's the matter with you? Come on. Catherine, Catherine, Catherine. Let go of me. She's dead. Let go. She's dead, Karen's dead. She's dead. Karen's dead. (splashing) (woman talking) (eerie music) No. No! (screaming and crying) (bang) (bang) (click) (rattling) (crying) As I call out your names, kindly take your places in the assigned cars. Mrs. Falco and Andrea. (crying) Mrs. Gracy and Mrs. Bruno. (crying) (rattling) (footsteps tapping) [Police Radio] 10-4. Affirm. The fat one didn't show up. Did you find out where the girl was? The mother says she was helping the nuns. [Passenger Man] Did you talk to any of them? [Driver Man] No, not yet. (breaks squeaking) Who's that? The father. Well, at least he managed to get here before they put her in the ground. Annie please, not now. (bang) (crying) I'm so glad you came. (police radio in background) [Driver Man] What are they, separated? [Passenger Man] He's remarried. (crying) (squeaking) I don't want to rush you but mass begins at nine. (crying) (clack) Hi Ali. Alice, sit on the fold-up, make room for your father. I want to stay where I am. Please do what you're told. Annie please, there is plenty of room. No problem, I can sit on the fold-up. Never mind, I'll sit in the second car. There's room up here Annie. Move over. What? (bangs) I said move over. (car engine revving) I want you to find out exactly where that girl was. And I'd like to talk to that Alphonso character before they get back from the grave. Let's go. (car engine revving) [Man] It's such a tragedy, we're not even safe in a church anymore. That darling little Alice, she's taking this so well. Your husband and I were just saying what a great help she's been to her mother. Hey, will you make sure you tell Catherine that she must call me at once if she needs anything. Thank you, there's nothing anyone can do. I'll be staying here with my sister for as long as she needs me. (squeaking) Angela, stop eating, haven't you had enough? Jim, help me clean up this mess. You don't need that drink. I've made arrangements to stay in town for the next few day, I'll be here if you need me. Don't you have to go home? You don't have to stay, I'll be here for a while. Annie you're only 10 minutes away and Jim and the children need you. Catherine please, Jim wants me to be here. My Angela can take care of everything at home. Isn't that right Jim? Beg your pardon? Angela can take of everything at home? Of course dear, yes. Okay then, I know this is a bad time to bring it up but, there's some things we have to talk about. It's no ordinary situation. I know. I just don't know where to start. Is it necessary to have this conversation in front of the children? God damn it Annie, the child was murdered. Or don't you understand what that means? Ask the kids to leave, there's some things I'd like to know. Listen, there's an awful lot of cake left. It's a shame to let it go to waste. Alice, would you bring this down to Mr. Alphonso? And thank him for the lovely flowers. Angela, Robert, go with her. Don't disappear, keep the noise down. (footsteps tapping) (bangs) (cat meowing) I heard everyone leave, it's all over huh? Well, you die and they put you in the ground and it's over. Such a shame, such a pretty girl too. Too bad she was the one to end up in the box. (squeak) My mother thought you could use some cake fatty. Thank your mother for me, such a lovely lady. God always takes the pretty ones. (bang) Wow, is he fat? [Robert] He scares me. Really? That ugly bastard doesn't scare me. Come on Alice, let's get out of here before my mother hears you. (eerie music) [Angela] Robert don't follow us. We taught you, we don't want you with us. (bang) [Dad] What the hell's the matter with you people? [Annie] You have no idea what I'm talking about. [Dad] What's she trying to say? [Jim] Alice was the last one in that church. [Dad] So what's that supposed to mean? [Annie] What do you think it's supposed to mean? [Catherine] Stop it, I won't listen to this again. (bang) You saw the photographers at the church. The police do investigate a murder you know. I still don't understand what that has to do with Alice. Everyone knew she was the last one in the church. They wanna talk to her, they think she may have seen someone. What if the police find out about the veil? What veil? Jim, what's she talking about? She had Karen's veil in her pocket. For Christ sake, she probably found it on the floor. I'm sure you didn't even ask her where she got it. Annie, why'd you have to start this? I think you've gone too far. Shut up, I know what I'm doing. (eerie music) (rattling) (thunder roaring) (violin music) I have an appointment with Detective Brennan. Take the elevator to the third floor. Make a left, his name's on the door. (thunder roaring) (soft music) (bang) (banging) (bang) It's open, come in. Sit down. (tapping) (phone ringing) Sorry about your daughter, I guess you got a lot of questions. Yeah, you're right, I was hoping you could tell me something. As a matter of fact, my partner's down in your neighborhood now checking on a few things. Is anything being done to protect Catherine and my daughter? What makes you think you need protection? I don't know, I couldn't imagine anyone killing Karen. People do crazy things. Mr. Spages, you mind if I talk to Alice? Where's that gonna get ya? Alice was the last one to go into the church. She might have seen something, something she knows nothing about but might set us in the right direction. For example, the veil, exactly where'd she find that veil? (click) Ray. Listen, about the veil, it's obvious to me that Alice came in after the murder. I spoke with her, she said she found it on the floor when she came in. Karen must have dropped it during the struggle. Mr. Spages, how did Alice know it was Karen's veil? They're all alike, they all come from the same store. Alice never said it was Karen's veil. Everyone just assumed it was, and the name is Spages. According to you sister-in-law Alice said it was Karen's veil. She's always jumping to conclusion especially where Alice is concerned. Well, your wife didn't disagree with her. Well my wife's been under a little strain lately. Does you sister-in-law dislike your daughter? It's probably more accurate to say she doesn't like me. Come on, you really think she dislikes you enough to implicate your daughter in a murder? (thunder roaring) I don't like where this is leading. You can just forget about talking to Alice. (squeaking) I spoke to the principal, she's made a repeated request that the kid see a psychiatrist and for some reason the requests have been ignored. Here, there's the record, see for yourself. (thunder roaring) This kid is nuts. (thunder roaring and rain pouring) (phone ringing) St Michael's residence. [Dad] Father Tom please. I'm sorry, he's having lunch right now. [Dad] Well, he's expecting my call it's very important. I'm sorry, but Father don't like to be disturbed at meal time. Tell him it's Dominick Spages. Fine, if you leave your number I have him call you back. Look, damn it. Hey, don't raise your voice to me. I don't care who it is, I'm just following the rules. (rattling) Look, it's very important I speak to Father Tom. [Mrs. Tredoni] Well, if I gave in every time someone told me that he'd never eat a meal without interruption. That's okay Mrs. Tredoni. Hmm. Sorry Tom, I told her to put you through when you called but I guess she forgot. Where are you? I'm at the police station. [Father] Did they mention anything about the school? No, what about the school? Well, they came and took Alice's records away. I couldn't stop 'em. You know, I don't believe those bastards. You know what they're trying to do? Now, take it easy, I know Brennan he's not that kind of guy. Yeah well, now he wants to talk to Alice. I wanna talk to you alone for a few minutes. I've got some things to tell ya and I haven't had a chance. (rain pouring and thunder roaring) I'll be going out for a couple of hours Mrs. Tredoni. [Mrs. Tredoni] Are you coming home for supper Father? (bang) I knew that was going to happen and that is precisely why I don't like interrupt him at meal time. A-huh, there is a good reason for everyone. (soft music) (Karen Voiceover singing drown out by music) [Annie] Alice, put that knife down. That's too heavy, be careful. (bang) What did I tell you? Don't hit me, don't hit me, don't hit me, I didn't mean it. I'm not going to hit you. Stay still, when have I ever hit you? What you need is a few good smacks. You liar, you were too. (cracking) [Catherine] Alice, don't move, you're walking on the glass. Don't move. [Annie] She called me a liar, now I am gonna hit her. Annie, get the dustpan. You see, she was gonna hit me, it was an accident. Stay still before you cut yourself. Look at this mess, I just finished cleaning. I told her to be careful, she never listens to me. It was an accident Annie, she didn't mean it. Tell your aunt you didn't mean it. It's always an accident. She hates me, I didn't do it on purpose. I told her it was too heavy and she goes right ahead and does it anyway. This is why she should be back in school. I'm not going back to school. I'm never going back, I wanna stay with you. You belong in school. Your mother doesn't need you here, I'm here. Yes too, she does too. I'm never going back, I won't go. Annie why must you keep insisting on this school business? With all the trouble she's been in she can't afford to miss a single day. What trouble? I spoke with Father Tom and we agree that Monday is soon enough. Not Monday mommy please. Have it your way Catherine but the child belongs in school. This is my house, you won't be here forever. I can't wait 'til you're gone. I forbid you to talk to your aunt that way. She makes me so nervous, I do everything wrong when she's around. But you don't mean what you're saying. Aunt Annie loves you, she only does things for your own good. If you'd listened to her you wouldn't have dropped the milk. Why is she always right? Catherine. [Alice] You know what, take her side. That's enough. Aunt Annie is very generous to stay with us and I don't wanna hear anymore about not going to school. I know that you miss Karen, so do I, but we both have to get back to our usual lives. Don't you need me here? Of course I need you and you can help me. But you can't stay out of school. Would you take the rent check down to Mr. Alphonso for me? Don't take too long love, your daddy'll be here soon. Move over. Alice. Thank you. (kiss smack) [Annie] Did you find the cross? [Catherine] No, I'm sure it was lost at the church. [Annie] Well Alice doesn't have it, I've been through her things. [Catherine] Annie, why did you do that? I told you I would ask her. Why don't you trust her? [Annie] I know how important that cross is to you Cai. I think Alice knows where it is. (opera music) I know you're there Alice, you can come in. (squeaking) I won't bit you. (laughing) How did you know it was me? (squeaking) (bang) I have the rent check. I was gonna slide it under the door. Where do you want me to put it? There's so much junk around this filthy place. I bet you never clean it. It smells like cat piss. My aunt says you should be reported to the Board of Health. What's the matter fatty? Stuck in a chair? You don't like your aunt do you? I don't like you. You know why you don't like us? Your aunt and I are two very perceptive people we know what you did at the church. (laughing) I can't wait to tell your father all I know about you. What the hell do you know? Come on, the check. (opera screaming) Damn it, look what you've done to this check. Let me go. (laughing) Where are you goin? You're not in a rush are you? I know what you have downstairs. Have you been snooping through my things? Your things? They're not your things. (laughing) Karen will come for them. The dead have ways. The dead don't rest easy. (laughing) You better let me out. (bang) I'll scream. I'll scream and my mother'll call the police. (laughing) The police were already here today and if they come back I'll take them downstairs. Get away, go, you weirdo. I'm killing your cat. No. You pressed up against me once before you disgusting slob, you'll never do that again. (bang) [Mr. Alphonso] No, don't kill my cat. Don't kill my diamond. Ah, stop it, I can reason with you. If things were so bad at school, Catherine should have been the first to know. I don't understand why you let it go on so long. It wasn't that serious until recently. Anyway, they weren't really sure exactly what should be blamed on Alice. She has knack of making things look like accidents. Thought I could handle it myself, I used to talk a lot with her but lately she set up a barrier. (clack) (eerie music) (thunder roaring) (piano music) (violin music) (footsteps clacking and squeaking) * Oh give me something to remember you by * When you are far away from me * Just a little something * meaning love can not die * No matter where you chance to be * So I'll pray for you * I will pray for you * It will see me through like a charm * Until your return * So give me something to remember you by * When you are far away from me Alice. (screaming) Annie! Annie! (screaming) No! Alice. Alice, stop. - What's going on, Alice? - Annie? [Mr. Alphonso] It's Alice! It's Alice, it's Alice! [Catherine] Annie, Annie, Annie! (screaming) Someone, help me please! Help me! Help me please! Someone help me! (tires screeching) Dom! Dom! Christ, what happened? Lots of bleeding, someone attacked her Lets get her to the hospital in the hall. Get her to the hospital. (screaming) Alright, okay, I got you. Did somebody call the police? I don't know. Jim. Jim. Jim. [Father Tom] Tell the police I'm taking her to St Michael's Hospital. Dom, find Alice, make sure you find her. (eerie music) (footstep tuds) (rattling) (click) (suspenseful music) (bang) (suspenseful music) (rattling) (crying) (suspenseful music) I didn't steal it, I was saving it for you Karen. You can have it. Oh daddy, daddy help me. It's alright baby it's okay. It's okay. I saw Karen. I will, shh. I saw Karen. Daddy, I never meant for her to die. I know you didn't. [Alice] I know it was Karen daddy, I think she wants her doll. (clacking) (bubbling) [Intercom Voiceover] Dr. Sarno, 383, Dr. Sarno, 383. Mmh. Okay. Bye. (clack) Is she alright? Yes. She's just so frightened. Oh Tom, what am I gonna do? Everything's happening so fast. Dom said whoever did it frightened her half to death. [Father Tom] Where was she? She was in the basement. Who's doing this to me? Haven't I had enough? Alphonso told the police it was Alice. They're on their way here. Did he her? Of course not, how could he? He's only repeating what he heard Annie scream. Don't you see, people believe what they want to believe. Well, what's important is what the police will think about this. Well they don't know her. No one knows her like I do. What if Annie tells them what she told me? Well we'll just have to wait and see what happens. What are you saying? She was hysterical, she didn't even know me. Annie would never say something like that if she were herself. Catherine, there's Detective Spina. Tom, talk to 'em. Let me go to Annie, just give me a minute please, please. Catherine. (footsteps stomping) Annie. Annie. Annie, I wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to you Annie. I know you won't do this to me. You didn't realize what you were saying. How could you, you were so upset. Don't turn away like that. What is the matter with you? You've gonna crazy, am I some kind of stranger? Please Annie, please. I will never forgive you if you do this to me. Never, never. Excuse me Father. Get through here. Hi Mrs. DeLorenze. I won't keep you long. You know I have to talk to you. I want you to tell me everything that happened. Where's Jim? I want Jimmy. Leave her alone, I'm her sister. I was there and I can tell you anything you wanna know. I'm sure you can Mrs. Spages and I'm very interested in hearing everything you have to say. But right now I wanna be alone with your sister for a while. Uh, Father, you think you and Mrs. Spages could leave the room for a minute. I'll be right with you. Annie. [Annie] Oh Jimmy. Jimmy. Annie, Annie. What happened? (crying) Jim, oh Jimmy. (crying) Honey, I was so worried. Somebody called and said somebody tried to kill you. Oh my God Jimmy it was awful. She stabbed and stabbed my legs. Who Annie? Who? Annie, don't. She tried to kill me. Oh my God, I don't believe it. I don't believe it. Annie, shut up. Cait, for Christ sake, let her talk. Alright, what's going on here? She's like my own, I love her Catherine. You hate her! Because you knew I was pregnant when I got married. That's not true. I love Alice, may God strike me dead if I'm lying. Annie don't, you realize what you're saying? It was Alice, it was Alice. Liar! Liar! You're all liars! I'm not lying, I'm not lying. I wanna believe it was her. Why not Angela? She wasn't in the church? See, you see. Don't you see what they're trying to do? This is Detective Mike Spina, I wanna be connected with the Paterson Police Department. (crying) (piano music) Now, remember Alice, I want you to say no to every card. I want you to lie. Is it the six? No. [Interviewer] The four? [Alice] No. It was the six wasn't it? Yes. Yes, now we know it's working. Now let's get to these questions shall we, yes. Now, do you intend to answer truthful to every question? (rattling) Please answer yes or no. Yes. Do you know for sure who stabbed your aunt? No. (rattling and clicking) [Interviewer] Did you stab your aunt? No. During your entire life, did you deliberately hurt someone who trusted you? During your entire life, did you deliberately hurt someone who trusted you? I put Debbie's coat in the toilet if that's what you mean. But I didn't lie, I told the sister I did it. Now, please Alice, answer yes or no. Yes. In the suitcase found in the basement were a white dress and a mask, are they yours? Yes. Are you deliberately withholding any information regarding the attack on your aunt? No. (rattling) Do you know who stabbed your aunt? No. (rattling) Do you know who stabbed your aunt? Yes, it was Karen, it told them it was Karen but no one believes me. It was Karen. Alright Alice, thank you. They're finished. The matron will take you back to my office and I'll give you the test results there. [Catherine] What about Alice? I'll bring her back with me. Will you give me Alice's coat. [Dominick] What do you need that for? You'll get it back. Thank you. (clacking and bang) (thunder roaring) (bang) (exhales) Well? I don't know what to tell ya. Well for Christ sake, did she fail or didn't she? Technically, I guess she failed. What do you meant technically? Well, I asked her if she knew who stabbed her aunt, she lied, she said no. So I asked her again, she said it was her sister. But her sister's dead. Yeah, but she wasn't lying. So what do you want from me? It's obvious the kid is off the wall. I wanna book her, if not for the murder, for the stabbing of her aunt. We'll let the psychiatrist give us some answers. She is a weird little girl. Did you notice her tits? When I went to put the tub around her she looked up at me like she wanted me to feel her up. (scratching) Hey, the little bitch is bumping your machine. Hey, hey, hey, hey stop that. (banging) Damn you, stop that. (bang) (bell ringing) In the name of the Father, the son and the Holy Ghost, amen. Bless us our Lord for these, our gifts, which we are about to receive from thy bounty, through Christ our Lord, amen. In the name of the Father and the sun and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Why couldn't I stay upstairs? You know I'm not feeling well. Because I can't be running up and down. And tell the children to stay out. What children? You know there's no children in the house. You want me to feed you, or you can manage by yourself? I am not dead yet. Then eat. Where's my wine? I have only two hands Monsignor. Father's not coming to lunch? You sure you don't wanna come to the shelter with us? No, I don't think that'd be a good idea. She only needs the two of you now. Well, come inside, I'll get you the information you want. (bangs) Oh, that must be Tom now. And everything is ice cold. Cold? No, tell him not to worry, she's a good woman. What are you talking about? You don't make sense. (bang) You didn't eat your lunch. I want my cake, now. I'll help you. Now, this is only the order sheet for the coats. I'll call them on the superior and tell her you're on your way. She has the complete list of all the names and addresses of those who purchased one. Angela has one, doesn't she? Why Angela, what are you groping for? Well, Alice said she saw Karen in one of those coats. It's obvious she saw someone, maybe it was Angela. You realize you're doing to Angela what you think Annie is doing to Alice. Well if it wasn't her, whoever it was might be on this list. (bang) If this lead doesn't work out how long will you stay around and play detective? I don't know Tom, I have to stay until a killer is found. And what about Julia? I can't answer that right now. And thanks for the car, I'll drop it off tomorrow alright. (eerie music) Subject, Alice Spages, 12 years one month. Normal physical development. (banging) Subject represses hostilities toward her mother and estranged father. (bang) (knocking bangs) What do you want? Strong indications of a schizoid personality. Subject's capable of extremely violent action. (knocking banging) Come in. [Nurse] Dr. Whitman, Mr. And Mrs. Spages are here. Yes. Sit down. I had a session with Alice this morning and I thought perhaps I should talk to you before you see her. Is anything wrong? Well, it's far too soon to be making judgements. As understaffed as we are here we try to give the children as much time as they would have in private practice. I've diagnosed hundreds of cases exactly like Alice but to eliminate any possibility of error one tires to suspend judgement until one can observe as much as you possibly can. Dr. Whitman I think you should know that my attorney is doing every he possibly can to get Alice back home with her mother. That's exactly what I want to warn you against. I don't think you should encourage Alice to believe that she'd be coming home soon. Perhaps being at home with her mother is not the best thing. What does that mean? Be prepared for hostility from Alice. I mean, it's certainly natural that she would think that you were responsible for her predicament. You might say, that like all of us, she blames others for her troubles. She is here because of a lot of other people. Alice has many deep seeded problems. But she is not a murderer. Alice needs psychological help. Well in that case, I assume you'd have no objection to our using our own psychiatrist. Not at all. Would you take the Spages down to the playground please. [Nurse] Yes. Let me remind you to be candid about the issue of coming home. Be assured she will get the best possible treatment here. Oh, Mrs. Spages, why did Alice conceal from you the fact that she's begun menstruating? The parents so often don't know their children as well as they presume. (bang) (eerie music) [Dominick] Ali, how you doing honey? [Alice] Fine. [Catherine] Did you sleep alright? How's your room? (bang) Why'd you bring the suitcase, aren't you taking me home? Not until the doctor says you're ready. We met Dr. Whitman. What did you think of her? She said you had a nice talk. What'd you talk about? A lot of things. Like what Ali? I told her aunt Annie lies and that you let her. That's not true. You're just like aunt Annie and that slob Alphonso. You wanna keep me here. Alice, now you're hurting your mother, I don't want you to talk like that. Now listen, I don't want you to worry. I'm going to find out the truth. How can you? You have to go home to your wife. Honey, I promise, I intend to stay until I find out who was in the hall with your aunt. Come on. I don't wanna stay here. Why can't I go home? [Dominick] You heard the judge, you have to stay until the medical tests are completed. Medical tests? She's a psychiatrists. Everyone thinks I'm crazy cause I said it was Karen and you don't believe me either. Can you understand that there are two different reasons why you're here? One is because you were in the basement when your aunt was attacked. But I didn't do it. I know you didn't do it and I'm gonna find out who did. I saw Karen. Look, many times we think we see things and later we realize we were wrong. But sometimes it's important to find out why. Dr. Whitman wants you to sign a release form for medication. What does she need that for? [Dominick] Stay here, I'll see what it's about. (footsteps clacking) Would you like to show me your room and I can help you put your things away? I don't want to. (zipper squeaks) I packed your heavy robe just in ca... I don't need it. (eerie music) I didn't put you here Alice. What's wrong with you? Why won't you talk to me, I'm your mother. I have nothing to talk about. Well you had plenty to say to Dr. Whitman. Why didn't you tell me you had your period. Why doesn't everybody just leave me alone? Leave you alone? Don't you know that I love you. You're on my mind every minute. Take this, you know it's not mine. I thought maybe you might want it now. Well I don't, I don't play with dolls anymore. I'm sorry. I guess I just keep forgetting how old you are. I'll be back tomorrow. Is there anything you want from home? No, just leave me alone. Don't take this out on me Alice. I am trying. (eerie music) [Alice] Mommy no, don't go. Please don't leave me here, I'm sorry. (crying) (eerie music) And why can't you see that it makes just as much sense that Angela could be guilty? [Catherine] Dom, you're wrong. You're looking for something that isn't there. [Dominick] Her name is on the coat list. (clack) Look how small Karen's coat is. It's a size seven, Angela's would be at least a 14. How could Alice confuse the two of them? It was dark, she was so scared she didn't even recognize me. Dom, I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? You said yourself no one knew where Angela was. (phone ringing) Hello? (heavy breathing) Hello? (dead phone line beeping) (clack) I think it was Annie. What does she expect me to do? Forgive her and pretend nothing has happened? I think you should talk to her. Oh I will, when she admits that she lied. But why antagonize her, it can only hurt Alice. (phone ringing) I can't. Please answer. (clack) I can't, I just can't deal with it. Hello Ann? (dead phone line beeping) She hung up. (clack) Sorry. I shouldn't have asked you to. We can do it without her. I'll make everything alright. Can you? Can you? (crying) (piano music) (phone ringing) Hello? [Woman Voiceover] Hello Catherine, it's Julia. Oh. [Julia Voiceover] I hope I'm not disturbing you. I've been trying to find Dom, is he there? Yes he's here. It's your wife. Julia, what's wrong? [Julia Voiceover] I thought you were going to call. Is everything alright? How can it be? [Julia Voiceover] Why you so annoyed? I'm sorry honey, I didn't mean to snap. What's the matter? [Julia Voiceover] Nothing, it's just that I'm kind of lonely. Look, I can't talk right now. I'll call you there tonight alright. [Julia Voiceover] Are you sure nothing is wrong? I miss you, can't wait 'til you get back. Do you love me? Do you love me? Yes, I love you. I'll call you there tonight. Bye. (click) Alice was right, don't play detective, go home. Dom. I wanted it as much as you did. It was nice to be held. You know you're even more beautiful now. That's nice. We're both so dumb. I guess you're right. (kiss smack) (clack) Dom, don't you think you should go back? It's not fair. I can't. (eerie music) (bang) (eerie music) Oh, oh Mr. Spages, I was just ringing your room. You've got a call. Why don't you take it from here? [Dominick] Thanks. You bet. Hello? [Girl Voiceover] Uncle Tom? Who is this? [Girl Voiceover] Angela. Angela, what's wrong? [Angela Voiceover] I ran away, I'm hiding. I got Karen's... Honey, I can't hear you, you're gonna have to speak louder. [Angela's Voiceover] I've got Karen's cross and mommy won't let me give it to you. Listen, let me meet you somewhere and we can talk about it, okay? [Angela Voiceover] Will you tell? (crying) Now you know better than that. Has uncle Dom ever done anything to hurt you? [Angela Voiceover] No. Look, I'm leaving right now, where are you? [Angela Voiceover] I'm at, I'm in the Ivan home building. (crying) Alright, I'll be there in 15 minutes. (crying) Angela now, stop crying honey, there's nothing to be afraid of. Thank you. (clack) (suspenseful music) (bang) (water splashing) (suspenseful music) Angela, wait. (suspenseful music) Angela? (squeaking and fluttering) (stomping footsteps) (fluttering) (eerie music) Ah! (bang) (suspenseful music) (bangs) (exhaling rapidly) You don't have to be afraid of me. (bangs) (eerie music) (bangs) (bangs) (suspenseful music) (squeaking) (eerie music) (thud) (thud) (thud) (thud) (thud) God damn it, what are you doing to me? (thud and moaning) (thud and moaning) You? Oh my God. You fit me big, you and that whore. God wants you vanished. (screaming) Me-ah protection against the sneers of the devil. (thud) Father belongs to the church. (groaning) That's mine, mine. (screaming) That cross is mine. (crying and moaning) And it's mine. Mine. (bang and screaming) Mine. (banging and screaming) Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine. Thrust into hell, Satan and the other evil spirits who rob this earth, seeking the ridden of souls. (screaming) (bang) (church bell ringing) (clack and squeaking) (thud) (click and inhales) [Woman] Alright, let's settle down now. Don't keep Father waiting. In the pews. [Father] Hello boys and girl. [Children] Hello Father. Today is your last confession as a group so I want you to think very carefully what you're going to say. But remember, you don't have to tell me everything you've done since last Sunday. After all we don't want sister to miss her lunch. (laughing) And please remember Karen in your prayers. (eerie music) (thud) [Father] Is someone in here? Bless me Father for I have sinned. [Father] We're only hearing the children this morning. Bless me Father for I have sinned. Please Father I need confession. Father, please. Please hear me Father, I'm troubled. [Father] I have time. I lost my temper, I got angry with the Monsignor and I neglected my morning prayers. [Father] Oh, this can't be the reason you wanted confession this morning. Oh no Father, there is something. [Father] Yes? I know you, you're a good woman. It can't be as bad as you think. (exhales) I lose patience with the Monsignor. Sometimes I wish Father, oh I can remember when everyone respected him so much. [Father] I understand, it's not easy to see someone we love suffer. No, you don't understand. Sometimes I think that it would even be better if God, oh, it is a sin to think such thoughts? [Father] No, it's not a sin. You've devoted so much of yourself to us it's only natural that you should want God to spare us from pain. Yes, Father. [Father] You have great faith. Now it's because of this that you can look forward to death as a resolution. Yes, Father. [Father] Now, there's no greater reward than to spend eternity with our Lord. Yes, Father. I only wish you'd come to me sooner about this. Oh, so do I Father. [Father] There's no need to come to confession for this. Oh. [Father] When you're upset come see me. I am your confessor but I'm also your friend. Oh, thank you Father. (eerie music) (squeaking and thud) (calm music) (banging) (banging) I'm sorry to bother you Mrs. Tredoni. Father's not here. No, I'm looking for Mr. Spages. I knew he had to drop Tom's car off. I didn't see him. I'm very sorry, I'm cooking supper you'll have to excuse... No, but Dom was supposed to pick me up this morning and I haven't heard from him. I thought maybe he was with Tom. Well, could I wait for a little while. Suit yourself. (clack) Maybe he won't be back so soon. Do you think maybe there could be something wrong with the phone? I tried to call several times this morning, there was no answer. I was out. You can turn on the light and there are some magazines. Thank you. (shallow breathing) (eerie music) I made you some coffee. Oh thank you. It's in the kitchen. (eerie music) Sit down. This is really very nice of you. I didn't mean to put you to any trouble. It's no trouble. (eerie music) (clacks) Aren't you going to have any? I make it a rule not to have a coffee after breakfast. (clack) [Catherine] I know this is silly of me, I really should go home. I don't know why I'm so worry. I just can't imagine where he could be. Maybe you were afraid that God will send St. Michael to take another of your loved ones. When St Michael took my little girl I only thought of how cruel God was. Mrs. Tredoni I'm sorry. I never knew you had a little girl. God took her from me the day of her first communion. Don't you see? He waited until then to teach me that children pay for the sins of their parents. And then I was sent here to look after Father, not you. [Father] Mrs. Tredoni? It's Tom. Tom. Tom. [Father] Catherine, what are you doing here? I've been looking for you all afternoon. [Catherine] Where's Dom? [Father] There's been an accident. Dom? (Bang) [Catherine] Oh God, no. (screaming) (eerie music) The left humerus is fractured, the left clavicle is fractured, contusions and abrasions of the thorax. Have you heard from his wife yet? No, not yet. [Detective Brennan] He give any indication that he knew something, anything? Last time I saw him I got him a list of the families that bought school coats. He was convinced that Alice had confused Karen with somebody else. Because of Annie's attitude he suspected his niece Angela. We never did find out where that kid was at the time of the murder. (phone ringing) Brennan, yeah? You won't believe this, I found a cross lodged in his throat. It had to have been worn by the killer. It wasn't forced down his throat he bit down on it, there are teeth marks all over it. [Detective Brennan] See if it matches the description of the one belonging to Karen Spages. (clack) (calm music) (thunder roaring) (calm music) [Father] The train's gonna be at least a half hour late. What'll I do about Alice? Let's go get her, there's no need to stay here. (calm music and rain splashing) I'm not gonna tell her just yet. She's been without a father for a long time. I'm afraid to take him away from her so soon. [Father] You're wrong, I think you should tell her. I've lost control of my life Tom. I can't. [Father] Death does this to people. Well haven't I had more than my share? There's no such thing as share Catherine. (thunder roaring) (footsteps tapping) I'm frightened. Maybe I should leave her here at least she's safe. Don't be ridiculous Cai, she needs you now. Police will watch you both, you, I promise you have nothing to fear. For how long? What happens if they don't find the murderer? Alice is waiting. (footsteps clacking) (kiss smack) Where's daddy? He had to go back. [Alice] How come? Let's go home. We'll talk about it later. He didn't even say goodbye. Please don't feel that way. He kept his promise to you. It's because of him you're coming home. (clock ticking) (guitar music) Catherine. Catherine. (suspenseful music) (water splashing) Are you in the mirror too? Some the gate. (eerie music) (clock ticking) (calm music) Who's there? Who's there? (eerie music) (water swirling) (footsteps rattling) (click) (thud) [Police Radio Voiceover] Five three, eighth avenue. Two complainant by parking lot on a past 10-20. 10-4. Affirm. Affirmative, five three, looking for a diamond at this time. David, David, David. Affirmative, this we're at four sixteen west 146.

[Police Radio Voiceover] Go ahead 31. I'll be 10-15 for five minutes. [Police Radio Voiceover] 10-4, 31. Two additional units by him South. (meowing and snoring) (squeaking) (snoring) (meowing) (snoring) (thuds) (footsteps tapping) What were you doing in there? Just saying hello to Mr. Alphonso. I'm glad you did that, it was a nice thing to do. (footsteps tapping) (eerie music) Alice. Let's stop by aunt Annie's on the way to mass. Everything's gonna be okay. (suspenseful music) (orchestra music) (banging rapidly) (meowing and snoring) (eerie music) (banging rapidly) (screaming) Hey, you little bitch. (screaming) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (rattling) (record scratching) * Down in the meadow * in a little bitty pool (banging) * Swam three little fishes * and the mama fishy too * Swim said the mama fishy * swim if you can (bang and glass shattering) * And they swam and * swam back over the dam (foot step tapping) * Boop boop diten datem whatem choo * Boop boop diten datem whatem choo * And they swam and they swam all over the dam (church bell ringing) (calm music) (siren wailing) (bells ringing) (police radio in the distance) (speaking in foreign language) (bells ringing) (police radio in distance) She's inside, Father Pat's watching her. Let's go. Wait a minute, she's too close to Catherine and Alice. She sees her there's no telling what she'll do. Now, it's almost time for communion. Come with me into the sacristy when she comes up to receive I know I can get her to come with Father Pat and me. What if she doesn't come up? Look, I know her, she'll come. She hasn't missed. I want to have a marksman in the balcony. Not in my church, I can handle her. She wouldn't do anything to me. Okay Father we'll play it your way but my men will be covering all the exits. Nothing'll happen, she'll come. [Detective Spina] Let's go Father. (bells ringing) Later. (speaking in foreign language) (organ music and bells ringing) (speaking in foreign language) Faster. (speaking in foreign language) [Father] Please come with me Mrs. Tredoni. I want communion Father. I'm sorry Mrs. Tredoni, I can't give it to you now. I promised the police you'd come with Father Pat and me. But you give it to that whore! (congregation mumbling) (crumbling) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (eerie music) (crying) (eerie music) (mumbling prayers and crying) (eerie music) (thud) (eerie music) (crumbling) (eerie music)
