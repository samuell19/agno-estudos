It's been about two years now, I think. In the beginning, moving around all the time and that, it was different, it was a laugh. Then I got robbed. And after that everything changed. When you meet these people and you think they're your mates, and they're not, they just pretend. Makes me wish my mom was still here. All I can remember now is how she was when we found her. You know, the worst thing is, I though it was all right with this new family. But I'd rather starve than have anyone touch me like that again. Oi, oi, wake up. Ally. Ally, come on, let's go, come on. What? Wake up. Come on, Ally, get up. Come on. All right. Let's go. Why can't we just stay here. I need to sort this out again, come on. Danny's a creep, Jose. Yeah, but it's freezing, can't stay in this shit hole, it's too cold. All right. I'll deal with it, all right? Just stay awake for me. Yes. You know the thing that pisses me off, I can deal with the cold and rain, I haven't got a choice. But the dirty looks, people don't realize how quickly your life can change. And then you're where I am. I dunno, but maybe I still have hope. There's no way that this could last forever. How far is he from here? It's not much further. I'll see Danny and he'll let us crash in his car He'd better fucking do, we just left a good spot for this shit. My head's fucking banging. Fuck me, look at these two. Hey you're sexy. Dream on, little boy. I'm big where it counts, darling. You have a name? Don't go like you're too nice for me, I want a name. What's up, sweetheart? Fuck off. Fucking little cunt. You're worse than fucking little pervs. What do you want, Jose? I need somewhere to crash for a bit tonight. - Nah. - Come on, Danny. Look, it's not happening, Jose. What about your car?

You taking the piss? No. How the hell am I meant to save? Fair enough. Why do you do what you do? What? What do you mean? Why do you do it? Why does anyone do anything? Just happens. Where's your dad anyway? All right, a bit personal. Well if we're doing these questions, where's your dad? He's got another family now. Sounds like a dickhead. Yeah.

I've been saving this for years. What's this one? Now that's Persephone. She was taken by the devil, taken into the underworld. She was the daughter of the goddess of harvest. And when she was taken, the summer stopped. So the people... What's this? The moral of the story is, if you get taken into the underworld, don't take anything from it, then you might escape. What are you a teacher or something? Mechanic back in the day. That's when we only had libraries and books. Where's your dog? Oh, he died a few months ago. Why don't you just get another one?

Just gonna let him walk away? That's not the way. Carol, please. Please, just go to the police, we can't let him get away with this. He won't get away with it. How, Carol? I'll sort it, I'll sort it, love. I'll sort it, all right? He won't get away with it, I promise you. I can still feel his breathe. His breathe, it stank you know, his breathe. His hands, pushing himself on me. I can still feel it. I pushed him back, and he stood there, he was just on top of me. I get it, Ally, I do get it. But you've got to think about something else, yeah? Lose this shit out of your head. Take it from me. Carol! You've got to. He'll pay, I'll make sure he does. But you've gotta leave it.

She's not all right, she never was all right. She never will be all right. Don't shit on your own bloody doorstep, understand? If we don't get that money back, we're seriously fucked, and I'll put bloody Chris' handy work in the shade. Yes. It's Carol. Something's happened. The runner, she's lost the gear. On my way. There's no need, honest. All I'm saying that payment, it might be a bit late. See you at 4:00. What's he saying? He's coming round for the money. This is all my fault. If I hadn't... I'm sorry. Give us one more day, mate. One more day, bruv. You see... It's just... See, how uncomfortable that was. All that silence. When somebody's dead, it's even quieter and painful. Just before you go, it's very painful. Trust me. I give you 24 hours. Kevin, sweetheart, I've got a job for you.

I'm dying. What you on about? I moved here to be closer to the hospital and the appointments and things like that, you know. What do you mean you're dying, Frank? Time's running out for me. I don't understand. Don't start that, you know, the last five years I haven't really been living. I've just been waiting for them to put the nails in the coffin. Would you believe that? But things have changed since then, and things are much better now. But these last few days it's been exciting, it's been fun, it's been great. So I've decided to think about living and not dying. Frank, you're not listening to me, what are you gonna do? You need to go the hospital, you need to go to your appointments. Calm down. I'd rather die in my own home and die here. Listen, those people are after you and they're after me. We've got to get out of here. Come on, think about it. Don't leave me now. Hurry up, it's fucking cold. Ilyas, you can't just fucking barge in, man. Go, go. You fucking beat my Kevin. You fucking. Now calm down, down. You fucking cunt. Calm down. You fucking cunt. Sit, sit down. Easy, man. Sit down.

Look what they've fucking done to me, Frank. Don't worry, it's just a few bruises. It'll be gone in a few days. Look what they'd done. Don't get too upset about it. A few days you'll be right as rain. Okay, let's get this dye done and then we can move on. Where are they? Why don't you ask that fucking bitch over there. They're best mates. We're okay. Let's go. We should be careful though, he might still be around. Do you reckon she saw anything? You know these people, what they're like. If they follow us. Don't scare me, Frank. I don't know. I want to know where they are. It's by the posh bitch. What posh bitch? Acton Gardens. What number? 22. Yes. It's Carol. We found the gear. Good.
