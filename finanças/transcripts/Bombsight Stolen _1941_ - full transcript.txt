[dramatic music] [dramatic orchestral music] It's a parachute. Aye, he'll be over this ridge. He'll be in the loch. [dramatic music] I got him, just give us a hand will you? [soldier] Get on with it. [soldier speaking faintly] -Heave! -Up. -He's a wet one. -Oh, he's a heavy one. He must have half the loch inside him. All righty, mate. Come on. He is one of ours. Aye, come on then. Oh! [children laughing] But Mrs. Barrington has authorized me to utilize this cottage as a military hospital. Hospital, indeed. You haven't a single patient. -Now, Mrs. Barrington-- -Not now, Kitty. Now, besides this farm is filled in by Mrs. Barrington herself. Three Manor Cottage, available for 20 evacuees. Now come on, children. One, two, three... -Oh, Geneva what are you doing? -Oh, get away, get away. Come on, Miss, you ducky. [yawns] Lousy organization. Children, children, get your bundles out. Ah, there's Mrs. Barrington. Now we'll see. -Good morning, Mrs. Barrington. -Good morning, good morning. [Mrs. Fernery] Oh, Mrs. Barrington. Taking the children for an outing? Isn't that nice? You mean those 20 little evacuees in the cottage now, didn't you? -Has anybody-- -But we've got our military hospital in here. -Twenty? -Oh, I must've added a nought by mistake. Now isn't that silly of me? Take Fidget to the stables, John. -Yes, Ma'am. -That's right. -Come on. -Off you go, gal. What shall we do with the children? Rub out the nought and make two. We'll put one in the boardroom and the other in the bathroom, the box room. -Oh, thank you. -Yes, in a minute, dear. Now, which two children would like to go and stay with dear kind, Mrs. Barrington? [horn honking] Now, I've made up my mind. Come along you two. Come out you two lucky ones. -You mean him, don't you? -No, I don't. I mean both of you. Oh, Evans? Go into the house and get me some pillows, blankets and eiderdowns. You know, the one with the hole in it. -Cigarettes. -It's my duty to remind you-- One thing at a time, Doctor, please. -Now, this is Ronald... -Mixby. -Mixby and... -Tony Andrews. -Tony Andrews. -How do you do? Oh, dear. [chuckles] -How do you do? -How do you do? But I thought you said little girls? No, they've always been boys. Have they? Oh, well it's all the same thing isn't it? -Much obliged. -What for? For having me. Oh, it's a pleasure. [chuckles] I hope. Miss Fernery, that reminds me. I do hope that you'll find time to be on the committee. Of course I will, Mrs. Barrington. -Which one? -The spit fun fire, Spitfire Fun Bazaar of course. Oh, thank you. Now, Ronald you must behave nicely while you're here. You see, it's very kind of Mrs. Barrington to have you. Bring 'em in 10 bob a week, don't I? -Oh. -[Mrs. Barrington laughs] Our orders say this is a military hospital. That's right, of course it is. -Now have you got a stretcher? -We have. Good, well bring 'em in, bring 'em in here. Well, there you are. I've arranged everything. -Mrs. Barrington? -It was quite simply. -It's just the natural... -Mrs. Barrington, -it's providence. -Providence, where? -I don't see anything. -We got a patient at last. A patient? But we can't take the patient. We've got two little evacuees. I... Oh, poor chap. But look, he's been wounded. Why didn't you tell me at once? Take him in of course. Take him in. Look at that poor fellow. Oh, Evans take those away. -We won't be needing them. -Is he sick? And tell Miss Helen to come here. She's in the kitchen garden. We've got a case. -This the room er here? -Take it easy, then. -[Ronald] Who is he? -He's a Spitfire pilot. -Hello, sailor. -[Ronald] Hello. [children chattering] Watch it now, now. This is no place for little boys to play. You can go to your room and stay there. That's right. Dear little chap. [chuckles] So obedient. -Aye, maybe. -Yes. Now the patient. That's right, you know the way. -You've been here before. -Yeah. [children yelling] Oh. Are you the case? No. I'm Ronald. -I'm evacuated. -Oh, how do you do, Ronald? Pleased to meet you, I'm sure. It's in there. [Helen] Well thank you, Ronald. Come on, Betty. -Morning, Andy. -[Andy] Good day, Miss Helen. -Do you want me to report this? -No, no, leave everything to us. -We're under the War Office, you know. -I see. Yes, we know all the regulations don't we, Helen? -[Helen] Of course, Mother. -[soldier] Good morning, Miss Helen. -[Helen] Good morning. -Helen, my dear he's an officer. He's got the CF, the D, the thing. Oh, why didn't you put your uniform on dear? -Well, I hadn't time to change, Mother. -Oh. And you might've brought John's yellow pajamas down. They do go with the room. -[Helen] Yes, Mother. -Yellow. -Lemons. -Lemons? Lemon, that reminds me, I haven't got a lemon in the house. [Helen] Are you ready for me, Doctor? Aye, I'm ready. [cart rattling] Well, I've set the shoulder, Helen. But there's a nasty great cut here I don't like the look of. -Would you get me some hot water please? -Yes, of course. Put a double Scotch in it will you, please? [chuckles] That'll come later in the treatment and we'll both have some. [Perry gasping] Ah, poor laddie. -You must've struck a log floatin' on the loch. -Is that what it was? -Felt like the Queen Mary. -Bad luck. Yes, it was. [engine rumbling] -Or was it? -[car door slams] -Oh, excuse me, Sir. -Here's your uniform, Miss. -Thank you. -[Evans] Excuse me, Sir. -Perhaps I can help you. -Thank you, sir. [door latches] [foreboding music] -[Ronald] Put that down! -I'm sorry, I'm... Oh. What are you doing here? I'm here for my health and what's it to you anyway? What were you doing with my luggage? -Your luggage? -Yes, my luggage. Tell me sonny, this is 3 Manor Cottage, isn't it? It is. Most extraordinary. -How's that? -Oh, it's fine, thank you, Doctor. -Hm. -[Mrs. Barrington chuckles] -Well, how's the patient? -Oh, grand thanks. I'm in very good hands. May I use your telephone? I'm afraid I've got to report this. I'll go and ring up the aerodrome. Sorry, it's official. I better speak myself. Thank you. -Oh! -I wonder if you could-- Yes, yes, in a minute, in a minute. [Ronald] Oi! [luggage thuds] -Oh. -Excuse me but-- No, no, I can't bother with things like that now. I've got a wounded man on my hands, I've got reports to fill in. -Some other time. -Yes, please but you are Mrs. Barrington. I know you've come about the ration cards, -I know I filled -No. them in all wrong but it isn't my fault and I really cannot discuss the matter with you now. Madam, you're mistaken. -I'm Dimble. -Oh, are you? I'm so sorry. Yes, but I can't do anything about it now. But I've come to take possession of the cottage. But there is no cottage. -No cottage? -No, no cottage. Please. Look, it says on that board cottage to let. Oh, yes that board. Well, I meant to take it down. [chuckles] You see, things all changed. Now this is a military hospital. Madam, I have rented this cottage from Messrs McPhail & McPhail, the estate agents. Look, here is a correspondence. I've paid in advance and my check was accepted for the Michelmas quarter. Michelmas, when does Michelmas come? Before or after Christmas? I never know. Oh, of course I remember now. Yes, yes. But didn't you get my letter telling you not to come? No. Hello, Sir. Perry speaking. Yes, I'm afraid so, Sir. Had to bail out and landed in the ditch. No, sir, no. Loch, Loch Tay. Yes, Loch Tay, that's right, sir. I know what we'll do. We'll send the boy over to the house and you can have his room. I can see you're a born organizer. Well, it does come rather easily to me. [chuckles] Little boy, come here. Look my child, I'm afraid you're not going to have that room after all. -This is Mister... -Dimble. Dimble. [chuckles] He is going to have it. Lousy organization. Now look here, sonny. You must never use that word. -Organization? -No, no... [Mrs. Barrington chuckles] The other one. It's not a word we use in the country. No, no, no, now think of all the lovely things in the country. The trees, the birds, the little animals, the goats. Get your bundle. -Oh, Evans? -Yes, Ma'am? Oh, Evans take this boy away and put him in the maid's room. -Hey! -It's all right she isn't there. Now run along and be happy. Remember, it's the one thing I insist upon. [chuckles] Evans, it might be better if you gave the boy your room and you went into the attic. -Very good, Ma'am. -All right, sir. If you put me through to the IO I'll let him have the dope. [Perry chuckles] Right, goodbye, sir. -Actually, would you mind? -Not a bit. Hello? Flight Lieutenant Perry. Is that the IO? Oh, hello, Perry speaking. Yes. Spitfire FJ112. On patrol off Montrose. Yes, Montrose. Spotted Dornier 2,000 feet below. Got in two bursts but lost him in cloud. Yeah, that's right. Lost him in cloud. His rear gunner hit my engine. Yeah. Tried to get the bus back but she caught on fire. Yeah [chuckles]. Had to bail out. Yes, I had to, bail out. Yes. Uh-huh. I'm afraid she'll be a write off. Yeah, that's right. North bank of Loch Tay. Okay. Right, cheerio. [receiver clattering] [Perry panting] Yes. And all your own work? Yes. The heart of the highlands, highlands. [Charles chuckles] -You really like it? -[Charles] Oh, yes I do, I do. Oh, it's charming of you to say so. It's my naturalistic period of course. Oh, yes of course, of course. If I may say so, it fits the mood of the room. Do you really think so? Mind you, it had to go there because of this hole in the wall. You see, this used to be... Oh. This used to be John's workshop. He blew himself up. Oh, don't tell me. You're not a widow? A widow, me? Oh, no, no, no. Oh, John's still there. [chuckles] Very much so. What, do you mean he's a chemist? No, no, no, just nothing. He invents things. But he's not the John Barrington? -The Barrington Gunman? -Well, that was a long time ago. I had to put a stop to all that. There'd be no cottage left. I've put him the greenhouse now. He works there quite happily, and of course no gunpowder. [chuckles] [Charles laughs] Well, I'm sure I'll be very happy here anyway. Oh, you must. Happiness is the one thing I insist on. So do come and have all your meals with us won't you? Why certainly. Of course you'll have to find us as you take us. Oh, you're very gracious. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. [foreboding music] [Coronel] It's streets ahead of anything we've had so far. At 3,000 feet, 25 direct hits at all angles of approach. That was the stick from 5,000 straddled center of target. That's a beauty. Moving target at 6,000, too. Uncanny. Barrington's done it again. What's this? Accuracy goes to pieces above 9,000. Exactly. The stabilizer will soon correct that. Barrington may have intended to fit one. You know how he works. I do. Never sends us blueprints and we're not thought readers. Well, we'll have him down and talk it over. -Good. -As soon as possible, Sir. [pensive music] This the best room you've got? You must have thrown a sparrow out to make room for me. [Evans] It's been big enough for me for the last month. -Month? -I'm here for duration. Where were you before? You're not Scotch? London? I'm from London. -Really? -What made you come to this hole? -Dodging the blitz? -[Evans] That's it. Baloney. Been a butler ever since you left the Army? -[Evans] No. -Coulda told you that. -Smart aren't we? -You can always tell a real butler. Butlers' faces are white. If they pinch the boss's port they're red. Yours is brown. You coulda been a doorkeeper for instance. Really? No, then you'd have had medals, not ribbons. -Why didn't you get married? -Because, how do you know? Easy. You've had to do for yourself. No woman in your life. You're free. Did you quit London for this? Student of human nature aren't we? Elevens. I just deduce things. Am I allowed to go where I like? Mrs. Barrington's instructions are that you are to consider yourself a guest. -Paying guest. -You're therefore free to go wherever you wish except the lavatory. Hey, what do they expect me to do? The lavatory's Mr. Barrington's work room. Laboratory. Lab, well anyway nobody's permitted to go in except Mr. Barrington and Mr. Trently, not even Mrs. Barrington. You might get hurt if you do. Huh. I think I'll give this dump the once over. [pensive music] [playful music] -[wrapping rustling] -[playful music] [fumes hissing] What are you doing here? Didn't you know that nobody was allowed in here? -Sorry, Mister. I live here. -Oh, since when? Didn't she tell you either? Lousy organization. -Oh, mustn't say that. -Oh, I don't know, why not? -I'm inclined to agree with you. -I like your dump. Oh. Thank you very much indeed. I'm glad you improve of it. [throat clears] You're not very good at it are you? There is somebody supposed to be looking after you isn't there? Mm, that butler of yours. Yes, would you mind going back and being looked after again? Oh, do go away, please. That's not the way to lubricate an elastic motor. Well, it's the way I lubricate it. It's a cockeyed way. Here. You gotta do like this. Oh, doesn't it make an awful mess of your hands? What's it matter? Well, I really don't know. There. Now it's lubricated. -Yes, it certainly is. -You know how to put it in? Yes, thank you very much. Thank you for the lubrication. Now go away. Oh, do go away, please! You're making me nervous. I know, but that ain't right what you're doing. Here, you better let me. You got to be shown if you don't know haven't you? -Mm-hm. -Just watch me, then you will. These ready made planes you buy in shops aren't no good. -Oh, that one is. -No. What's your longest duration of flight? Oh, she stays up a long time. -How long? -Well, I've never actually timed it but it's... What, and you're a scientist? I made one that stayed up six minutes and 42 seconds. Tell me, how did you become such an expert in these things? Oh, this is just a hobby. It's not what I'm really going for. -Oh, what's that? -Ever heard of Sherlock Holmes? Oh, are you a disciple of Sherlock Holmes? He was the greatest man what ever lived. [Mr. Barrington chuckles] Yes, he did live didn't he? 221B Baker Street. I can't find the house now. -You smoke a lot don't you? -Yes, I'm afraid I do. Easy, "Hound of the Baskervilles, "Chapter Two, Nicotine Stains." Ah, yes but these stains are picric acid. [door rattling] All right then. Why have you got a copper for a butler? Got a what? Didn't you know? Your butler's a cop. Whoa! Oh, nonsense. I mean he... -Well how do you know? -Bet you a tanner he is. And what's more I'll prove it. Go on, call him. Evans? Where do policeman keep their watches? Well, I don't know, I never thought of it. I mean, on their wrists? Just you watch. -Yes, sir? -What's the time? -Half past 11, Sir. -It's impossible. It is, sir. Oh, Evans? Go and get my secatines, uh, scissors. Yes, Madam. -Well-- -Pay up your tanner. -He's your bodyguard, isn't he? -Damn it. Do I look like the sort of man who needs a bodyguard? You're a big shot inventor. Course you do. I will not have them putting policeman in my house. I'll sack him. You mean to say you didn't know he was a copper? -Well, of course I didn't. -Blimey, there's funny business around here. -"The Study in Scarlet," you remember? -Well, of course I do. -What's that gotta do with-- -It's elementary. You're working on a secret invention. No, I'm not. I'm working on a cure for influenza. Blow, nobody's interested in that. Oh, aren't they? Crooks aren't. That's what he is, a copper turned crook. What could he be after? What do you keep in the safe? Where do you keep the diamonds? The wife's jewels? He might be in with a gang. What do you know about Mr. Trently? Well, he's my assistant. I mean, he's been with me for years. -Here, wait a minute, I... -Look here. Gov, if I'm to take this case on you're to do as I say. Okay. Come on, we'll try the plane out. You must have given her 150 by now. [Mr. Barrington] Oh, I can give her far more than that. -150, no more. -[Mr. Barrington] All right, come along. -Nothing new there. -Just a minute, Weston. Look at this petrol tank. You can see it's three quarters full and yet... That one's a cannon shot. We'd better have the whole tank out. [MI5 Agent] But mightn't they have copied this bullet proof tank from us? They did, but how? Our new Barrington tanks have only been in production three weeks and this identical. Well, what's Scotland Yard got to say? Somebody's been talking. Possibly selling. You MI5 fellas probably know what a crank Barrington is. Won't work in government premises, won't stand for police supervision. And has an assistant who is shall we say a little doubtful. Trently? Nothing really definite against him. Educated in Germany, been back there several times, corresponds with people in Switzerland. Correct. You know as much as we do. Well, why don't you do something about it? But really, sir, we're not the Gestapo. Man alive, we're testing out a new bomb site at this moment invented by Barrington. Do the Germans known about that? You must have this assistant fella arrested at once. I'm afraid that's impossible, sir. First of all, we've no proof that it's Trently. Secondly, if it is we want to know how he gets his information to the enemy. Going for a little walk, Mrs. Trimm? No, I'm off to Glasgow. Oh, Glasgow. Glasgow, but what about lunch? There isn't gonna be no lunch. Oh. No lunch? For all I care there isn't gonna be no dinner neither. No lunch, no dinner? But Mrs. Trimm, you can't do that to us. Can't I? [laughs] I've given me notice to Mr. Evans. I'm not going to stay in this mad house -a moment longer. -But Mrs. Trimm, Glasgow, I mean you can't leave us without anyone? -[armor clattering] -Oh! Now look at what you've done, poor fellow. Now, I want you to enjoy yourself, do anything you like but don't touch things. Do you hear? [chuckles] Nevermind, nevermind. Forget all about what a nuisance you are. Evans, what's all this about Mrs. Trimm and Glasgow? Now what are you going to do about lunch? That's what worries me. You really must... [knocking] -Oh, it's you, Mrs. Trimm. -[door latches] Goodbye, Mrs. Trimm, and thank you so much for everything you've done. Oh, I couldn't Mr. Trently, really I couldn't. -Thank you very much. -All right, goodbye. Don't overwork yourself, princess. -What's that? -The uniform of the wounded hero. -And who are you? -A paying guest. -What's he talking about? -There's a patient over in the hospital, come down by parachute and he's got the tastiest bit of skirt you ever saw to nurse him. Miss Helen's at the cottage, sir. Mm, what a peacherino. But we don't stand an earthly, not with a Spitfire pilot in the ring. He's sweet on her, eh? Such ideas! And a wee laddie like you. -Oh, Mrs. Trimm, you're a cook aren't you? -That's right. Would you come into my office please? -But Miss Stokes, -Yes I know, -I've been waiting-- -I'll see you in a moment. [woman scoffs] -I've brought me references. -Thank you. Did my brother send me any message? No. You see, he's living at the cottage. I didn't know think it was safe to approach him. Quite right. Did you warn him about the butler? We did. Do you think my brother will find him troublesome? No, he won't come in contact with him as much as I did. Very well. Well, I think you've earned a little holiday. I'll advise you in due course. Thank you very much, I'm sure. Helen, would you care to go for a walk this afternoon? -A walk? -Yes, it would do you good. Well, yes Alan it would but, well there's my patient. Oh, yes, there's your patient. Yes. -It's all right. -Goodbye. Bye. [Charles] Good morning. Good morning. Haven't we met somewhere before? I don't think so. I've got a wonderful memory for faces. Well, I haven't but I think I'd remember yours. -I mean... -[Charles laughs] My name's, Trently. Oh, yes, you're Mr. Barrington's assistant aren't you? Yes, I am. -That his laboratory? -Yes, it is. Gosh, it must be interesting work-- It is, I'm sorry there's no one allowed in. Oh, of course not. [chuckles] [doors rattling] [door latches] [door latches] Hey Evans, were you in this room? Certainly not, sir. The door had been left open. I closed it. Well, I never thought it'd come to this, did you? Oh, I don't know. I think you got off rather lightly. Ye Gods, Alan, do you realize a whole college is packed out-- I was referring to the evacuee kid. You know, you might've been landed with a dozen. Well, I don't mind Ronald but I'm not gonna stand for all these waifs and strays. Oh, what are you gonna do about it? -What am I gonna do? -Yes. I'm gonna take a leaf out of Hitler's book and build myself an Ari, 10 floors up with a telescopic ladder so that I can pull it up after me. Has... Here, why have you been studying this altitude chart? Oh, good heavens. You're not still trying to prove to me that my bomb site's all wrong? As I've explained many times before, it is only 95% right. It isn't. It's absolutely perfect. Otherwise we'd have heard from the Air Ministry ages ago. Of course we wouldn't. They haven't had time to test it properly yet. Oh, rubbish. [piano keys chiming] Good afternoon, Miss Stokes. -Good afternoon. -I'm glad you came in. We have the new recording you ordered. Oh, I should like to hear it. [piano keys chiming] [dramatic orchestral music] I want you to go down to Freyo. My brother's there and he'll need help. I'll write to him today to tell him you're coming. He'll get it tomorrow afternoon. -Very well. -[gate latch clanging] [Charles] Hello there. Anything for me, Dimble? Uh-huh. -Letter and a parcel. -[Charles chuckles] -What about the house? -I'm goin' up there now. I can save you a journey. -Uh-huh. -Thanks. Now, let me see. Have I got everything? My hat, my gas mask, sandwiches, torch. My whistle. Where's, ah, there it is. [chuckles] -Yes. -[whistle shrilling] -Works. -Oh, Mrs. Barrington? -Oh, Mister, hello. -They told me you've been suffering from breakages so I got ya a wee present. Oh, how beautiful! -I'm glad you like it. -[laughs] You really are a quick sort aren't you, jewel? [laughs] [Perry groans] -Well, thanks. -[Helen chuckles] -Where have you been? -Well, we've only bought the things we needed haven't we, George? I've been waiting for you here for hours. I'm afraid it's my fault, Mrs. Barrington. I was quite fascinated by the scenery. It's lovely around here. Parcels, Ronald. Okay. Helen's bought me a new suit, two dickie dirts and posh titfer. Dickie, don't be vulgar child. Run along. Helen, bring my boots and help with the parcels, please. Now let me see. Clutch out, break off, engine. Come over and have a drink, Trently. Charming fellow isn't he? Oh, yes I think he's wonderful. [car door slams] Ain't love grand? Eh? Knight of the air marries beautiful nurse. I can see it in the "Daily Mirror" already. Oh, can you? Well, if you don't shut up I can see: "Evacuee Boy Found With His Throat Cut." Betty, take these parcels will you? Yes, Sir. Is every man madly in love with you? I think your ideas of love and mine are not the same. You don't know my ideas, yet. Here's to 'em. You know, George, I think you waste your time with the wrong sort of women. I never waste my time with any women. I quite believe that. [Charles laughs] Go on, drink it up. It's good for you. [laughs] Must I really drink this muck, nurse? Every drop. You may even need another dose. Oh, you shouldn't have moved. You know, you two made a very pretty picture. Nurse and patient, eh? [laughs] I'm a romantic sentimental sort of fellow you know? How very uncomfortable for you. No, on the contrary. [Charles laughs] Well, I don't suppose you're in much of a hurry to go back to your planes, eh? Must be a tough job. I like it. I take my hat off to you young fellas. Gosh, the speed of these murder machines, it must be terrific. Oh, we get used to it, you know? You fly Tornadoes don't you? -Yes. -Uh-huh. Over 400 miles an hour, eh? Oh, marvelous. And land under 70 they tell me. That's right. Who told you that? I dunno. People gossip you know? And a lot of talk in the other direction too. Defeatists. I've even heard that these new type of fighters aren't a patch on the old Spitfires and Hurricanes. I shouldn't repeat that if I were you. Well, of course not. But it's dangerous talk just the same. I'm so sorry Mr. Dimble, it's blackout time. All right, I'll be going. [chuckles] Here, don't mistake the gin bottle for the medicine in the dark. [laughs] -Goodnight, Mr. Dimble. -Goodnight. I don't like that man. He gives me the creeps. He is a bit of a hangover isn't he? Didn't you tell him rather a lot? None of it was right. Now, what woman was I wasting time with just now? Your supper ought to be ready if Betty's found a tin opener. Evans? Is that the patient's supper? -Yes, sir. -Well, you've got a lot to do. -I'll take it over for you. -Thank you, Sir. -Oh, hello. -Oh, Alan how nice of you. Well, I was just gonna take it over. -I thought-- -Well, hurry along or George will have his supper all cold. Oh, Ronald. I know, a proper twerp. The good Samaritan, eh? I was looking for you. -Oh, why? -This card just came for ya. Swish stamp and a very curious message. That's pretty cool nerve. Do you always ready other people's letters? Certainly not. This isn't a letter, it's a postcard. And postcards are fair game. "13 K-R across Q-B." -Are you sure? -Yes, see for yourself. That's torn it. I'm a little dense. What does it mean? If you must know it's a game of chess we're playing. I can't see how it can possibly concern you. All right. If that's the way you feel about it. [Perry] Hello. I've brought your supper. Well, that's very decent of you. Well they're shorthanded and I thought that I-- You'd find Helen here, eh? Well bad luck, she's gone. -Oh, don't run away. -I've got work to do. -More domestic duties? -Now look here Perry, I-- [laughs] I know, you'd like to knock my block off wouldn't you? We'll have a drink instead. The gin's over there. Go on, fix me one. Soup not too hot? Rissoles. Bet they strained the coupons. Cherries. Well, I asked Helen for cherries. Hm, bless her little heart. Thanks. Cheers. I say, you must get awfully bored cooped up in that lab all day. I suppose you think that at my age I ought to be scrapping, don't you? Oh, not at all. I think you chaps are doing a grand job of work. Old Barrington's considered rather brilliant isn't he? He's always struck me as being rather childish. Oh, has he? Barrington has the finest scientific brain in the country. -Oh, did he do that? -Yes, he did. Ever heard of a cannon gun? He did that too. Hm, okay. Well, thank you very much. I'm glad you approve. And now we've invented a bomb site that will-- [door creaking] There's someone at the door, Trently. It's Dimble going to bed. Dimble? Hm, he's always around isn't he? She loves me, she loves me not. She loves me. You know, I don't think I wanna hear about your bomb site, Trently. No, perhaps not. Well, I'll be getting along. Goodnight. Night, Trently. Damn it, man! Can't you make up your mind? First of all you want the thing and now you don't? I'm all ready to put it into large scale production, -only waiting for the word go. -But we can't give it. We still want it. It's the finest bomb site yet. But Barrington refuses point blank to come to London. Listen, my son, you can't give John Barrington orders. I've known John for 20 years and he's the most... Well, he's a temperamental cuss. I wired him to come down here, and this is what he dishes out. "Far too busy waste time coming see you." Stop. "Come here if you like." Stop. "Beer still good but no cook." Stop. "House full of evacuees, invalids and unmentionables." Stop. "Thanks for butler. "Have given him notice. "See 'Hound of Baskervilles, Chapter Two.'" Stop. "John." -Doesn't make sense to me. -Nor me. The man's a genius but a school kid at heart. I looked it up, Mr. Forest. Chapter Two is about a butler who is introduced into a household -to look after some documents. -Looks like your man's been spotted. Better come clean, Inspector. Well, sir, I placed one of our men there as butler to keep an eye on things. Oh you did, did you? That's just the one thing John Barrington won't stand for. Calls it official interference. So do I. Matter of Scotland Yard routine, sir. Routine butler? [scoffs] Expect John to swallow a pill like that? Might've wrapped it up a bit better. It's a question of safety, sir. Get me Barrington at Freyo. Safety? There've been a number of leakages up there. He ought to leave Scotland. He might listen to you, Sir. So I'm to go and get him? Is that it? He's vital to us. Cancel that call to Freyo. Oh, thank you, sir. Oh, by the way we've got a man at Freyo too, and we went to a lot of trouble to wrap up our pill. [Perry] That's grand. I say, take it right along. -[Ronald] Mr. Perry? -Yes, Ronald? -Would you come over here, please? -Sure. [hammer tapping] Is this all right? Yes, it's going on fine. -Mr. Perry? -Hm? Look, you may think this a bit daft but well... Well, come on, cough it up. Could I have a photograph of you? What do you want to do, swap it for a Clark Gable? No, I wouldn't swap it for one. No, just like to have one, that's all. [hammer tapping] Well, I'm very flattered Ronald but I'm afraid I haven't got a photograph. [teeth sucking] I'm scared stiff of a camera. [engine rumbling] [all chattering] [Mrs. Fernery] I love a lucky dip, don't you? -What? -I said, I love a lucky dip. Oh, no, thank you, Miss Fernery. I never touch alcohol. -Where's the ladder? -Eh? I distinctly said bring the ladder. Oh, Ernest, my dear. [chuckles] I thought you were the ladder with the man, the man with the... [Ernest laughs] But what are you doing here? Aren't you the new minister of something? -Where's John? -See press. John? He's somewhere about. Excuse me, there's the ladder man. -[Ernest chuckles] -[all chattering] Phew! Gotta keep these Philistines away from my books. Hello, what the devil are you doing here? Happened to be in the neighborhood. Ernest, you never happen to be anywhere in your life. -You're right... -Maggie, Maggie? I did want a quiet chat with you. Yes, I know this infernal bazaar has made this house more of a lunatic asylum than ever. Well, there's one place they daren't invade. Come along. [Mrs. Barrington] Betty, come and give me a hand dear. That fella looked like Lewis cartoon of Ernest Forest. It is Ernest Forest. Cabinet Minister is the house? Oh, I wonder why. And what do you mean by that ridiculous official telegram? Urgent, priority, secret, Ministry of Supply. What are you doing? Are you working there or something? -Yes. -What, you who fought red tape all your life? I'm still fighting it. It isn't as bad as I expected. Well, things have come to a pretty pass when you're on the side of the angels of Whitehall. Here, put that down. Don't you know you're not allowed to touch anything in here. Sorry, teacher. [Ernest chuckles] Look, John. Pulling together is no catch word. It applies to everyone, to men of ideas, just as much as to fitters and electricians. If we are going to win this war, we can't afford to have leading scientists pottering about individually just trying to find out things. We need new weapons. We've got to have an answer ready for every new trick of the enemy. Research must be carried on night and day. Yes, but I'm doing research work all the time. With one assistant. We could give you 100. Every hour's delay makes all the difference. And so? And so I've come to tell you that that bomb site of yours doesn't work. Well, that's impossible. It's a wizard of a thing up to a point. Yes, up to about 10,000 feet you mean? To be precise, 9,000. [scoffs] That infernal argumentative Trently must have been right after all. Well, I know nothing about that. All I can tell you is that we're trying to get hold of an American bomb site. Oh, no, that's fantastic. I mean, give me a chance to get it right. My dear fellow, you won't come to London. Well, I mean they can send it here. No, no. The Air Ministry won't agree to that. They say they won't take the chance of letting the thing out of their sight. What, even with the butler in the house? Not even with a butler in the house. All right, you can tell 'em that-- That you won't touch it? No, I'll show 'em just how hard an individualist can work. That's the stuff! You can come to London with me tomorrow. -What, tomorrow? -Yes. After all, I'm doing you a favor. You'll miss the bazaar. Yes, I never thought of that. Well, 9:30 in the morning. Glasgow Central Station. -All right, I'll be there. -Don't you be late. Oh, no, no. I'll start at dawn. I'll do even that to miss this bazaar. -[chuckles] -Goodbye. Can't you stay for the show, sir? No, I'm afraid I can't. It's really rather important. The rifle range isn't any use without the animal pictures. You promised to get 'em ready. I always keep my promises. I'll start working on them now. Cross me heart. [hammer tapping] Slip off and get me a bit of wire will you, Ronald? Okay. You're quite sure you remember the opening moves? Yes, I think so. P-Q-4, P-K-K-2, P-K-3... Mixby! [Ronald] Ow! -I only want a piece of wire. -You're not allowed in there. -Who says so? -I say so, no one's allowed in there. In there? I should think not. Why, even I'm not allowed in there. That's all you know. What about his friend the cook? The old trout that walked out on ya? The old trout? Whatever is the child talking about? Excuse me, Madam, I think he was referring to Mrs. Trimm. Oh, Mrs. Trimm, our trout, cook. There, now say I'm a liar. -Tsch, tsch, sonny-- -Tsch, tsch yourself. She went in there the morning I came here. If cooks are allowed to go in there why can't I? [Trently] Mrs. Trimm only went in there to tidy up. [Ronald] That's what you say. Well Betty, are you the palace pigeon feeder? Only since Mrs. Trimm left, sir. Mrs. Trimm did it, eh? Oh, yes, Sir. Mrs. Trimm was very jealous of her pigeons. She wouldn't let anyone go near them except herself. Well, now that she's gone do you mind if I feed them sometimes? I'm very fond of pigeons. Why certainly, sir. You can begin now. Oh. [chuckles] Thanks. [foreboding music] Helen? Helen, you seem too busy even to speak to me these days. You're not jealous are you, Alan? Jealous, me? Oh, no, certainly not that. It's nonsense. No, I just don't want to see you making a fool of yourself. Making a fool of myself? Well, you're practically throwing yourself at this fellow. I don't mind, I'm just speaking as your father's colleague because, well it's awful. I mean, you chased the fellow all over the place and it's becoming obvious. Even neglecting your allotment. But you can't take care of an allotment and a patient at the same time, Alan. And don't you think the patient's more important? Seems dependent upon the patient. Alan! Oh, hello, George. Hello. Hello, Trently, have they let you out? Well, that's wonderful. What's wonderful? -Your hair. -Oh, do you like it? I wasn't quite sure about it. Well, don't you like it? -No, I don't like it. -He doesn't like it. -Oh, I am disappointed. -Oh, I shouldn't bother about that. in that sort of thing are you, Trently? What do you mean? Well, you're not exactly a ladies man are you? I'm not a philanderer if that's what you mean. Oh, the nasty one. I say, I got some good news for you. -I'm going back tomorrow. -Yes, that is good news. [chuckles] So, a lot of things can happen before tomorrow. Yes, Mother's cooking the dinner. Season to taste. Oh, of course. Of course. Yes. Just a pinch of mustard I think. Now then. What exactly are we making, Betty? -Do you remember? -I didnae kin, Ma'am. I told ya I canna cook. Oh. Well, anyway it looks very good doesn't it? Another drop, there. [whistling] Just about the right constituency don't you think? Now, Ronald. What? He's right. Something definitely wrong with it. I know, eggs. Eggs. [chuckles] We've forgotten the eggs. [chuckles] [Betty] The eggs have gone, Ma'am. [Mrs. Barrington] Gone? Where? [Betty] There was six in the box, Ma'am. I give you my word. I put them by special. [Mrs. Barrington] Oh, nevermind. It's war time. -[bell ringing] -We'll do without the eggs. See who it is, Alan, will you? [Mrs. Fernery] Good evening, Mr. Trently. [Trently] Good evening. [choking] Ye Gods. Heavens. This is Mother's fault. -I'm not late am I? -Not a bit. What a relief. Mrs. Barrington invited me to her party. Oh, don't tell me it's informal. Oh it is a party, we were just too lazy to dress that's all. Oh. [chuckles]. Well, well, we're very elegant this evening aren't we? Kindly keep your bedside manner for those who need it. Mrs. Barrington's compliments. She would like to see you in the kitchen. Oh, delighted. [chuckles] Miss Fernery. Oh, good evening, Mrs. Barrington. -How sweet of you. -Mrs. Fernery. I'm sure you had some special reason for asking me. Oh, I'm so sorry. You see, it's Mr. Perry's last evening and we want an especially good party. Oh, how are you getting on? Oh, splendidly really. There are just one or two little points that perhaps-- Well, can I help you? Oh, oh, no. Oh, you mustn't. No, no. After all, you are a guest. Have my pinafore. You, I mean you... -[paper crinkling] -[fire crackling] Well, that was all very nice. Congratulations, Margarite. Much better than the 57 varieties we've been eating for the last few days, huh? [all chuckling] Thank you, John, but I don't deserve all the credit. -Oh, Mrs. Fernery. -That'll be the coffee. Run and open the door, Ronald. He appears to be in difficulties. I thought we'd have coffee all together here. I don't believe in segregating the sexes. Do you, Miss Fernery? Well, I don't believe in co-education if that's what you mean. By the way Mrs. Barrington, what's happened to that Mr. Dimble? -[Evans] Coffee, Madam? -No, thank you. He's driven over to see Lochinvar Castle. I told him the lucky story of the ghosts. He's going to write a whole chapter about it. But you've sent him to the wrong castle, Mother. The wrong, don't be ridiculous. Everyone knows that when the laird of Lochinvar dies or gets married, I forget which, -the piper paces the battlements. -The piper of Lochraer. Mother, you've sent him on a wild ghost chase. Goose dear, goose. Nevermind. Lochinvar will look lovely in the full moon, won't it Dr. Truscott? -Black or white? -If there was a full moon, which there isn't. And if he went the right way, which he hasn't. He took the Glasgow Road. -Did he? -Who told you? I have ways of finding out things. [foreboding music] Good evening. Who are you? What do you want? Just to talk with you. Are you going out? -That must wait. -Who are you? The person you were going out to meet. In fact, the meeting was called by my instructions. I wasn't going to a meeting. Where were you going then? [ceramic shattering] Haven't you made enough mistakes? Or don't you bother to obey instructions any longer? I was going to spend the evening at the Musical Society. I know, I know, but now you're not going. We have no room for fools or failures. Miss Stokes should have told you that. Miss Stokes seemed quite satisfied with me. Then she's more easily pleased than I am. I suppose you know the exact position I occupy. -I think I do. -Good. Then perhaps you'll tell me why you left Freyo. Because of the butler. I see. Then you're an even bigger fool than I thought. You realize what you've done by running away? -No, I don't see-- -It never occurred to you or Miss Stokes that you might be followed, hm? Where have you been since your return to Glasgow? Only to agency. Only to the agency, hm? That's exactly where they would have liked you to lead them. Perhaps this house is being watched now and I'm here. Do you realize what my arrest would mean for you, for all of us, for the Reich? [gasps] What can I do? Stay here until instructed by me. Keep your mouth shut. Don't answer the telephone. Don't even move. You're a menace to us all. Well, don't move anybody. I'm afraid I've got some work to do. I hope you'll all excuse me. -Goodnight, Miss Fernery. -Goodnight. Goodnight, night. Oh. [piano keys chiming] Say, what the devil's that row going on? Oh, that's the piano tuner. [Helen] But the piano doesn't need tuning. Don't be silly, dear. Pianos always need tuning. [chuckles] Oh, by the way, sir, shall I see you in the morning? I'm generally up at the crack. No, I'm afraid I'll be gone long before that. So, goodbye and good luck. -Thank you, sir, goodbye. -Glad you got that thing fixed. Yes, yes, it's being let out tomorrow isn't it nurse? -[Helen] Yes. -Bye all. Goodbye, Sir. -[piano key chiming] -[door latches] [Mr. Barrington] Oh, Evans? Evans, did you remember to put in any cigarettes? -I did, sir. -Good. You'd better shove that in the car now so I shan't forget it. No, no, no. I'll be working in the laboratory. Get some sleep on the train. Mind if I ask you something? Would you give this to my mom when you go to London? 27 Tollington Way. Well, of course Ronald. -I'll post it in town and then-- -No, I mean give it to her. Well, I don't get to London 'til late, you know. Only, it's Mom's birthday tomorrow and I got a little present for her. All right. I'll see that she gets it, that's a promise. -What is it? -Oh, tain't nothing much. Just something I picked up. It ain't wrapped up yet. You give it to Evans, tell him to shove it in the suitcase. Goodbye. -See you soon. -Goodbye, Sir. -[Piano Tuner] Goodnight. -Goodnight, Sir. -Tired? -Yeah, I think I'll go to bed. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. [gentle music] -Come and have one for the road. -No thanks, I never do. -You sure? -Yes, thanks. Lovely isn't it? Yes. You know Helen, I'm very grateful to you. Nonsense, it was fun. And yet, I wonder. -What? -About you. How do you mean? The way you look sometimes, as if you were diving onto an enemy plane. You'd never let him get away would you? Well, I hope not. [chuckles] Funny. Look. New moon. Have you wished yet? No. Well, go on. Shut your eyes and make one. [gentle music] Well, that wasn't what I wished for. Wasn't it? You must be mad. -Let's try again. -Nonsense. You're incorrigible and I'm going. Oh, no, don't go, Nursey. Don't leave me, I don't think I ought to be left. Why, are you frightened of the dark? -Yes, a little. -[chuckles] Goodnight. Sleep well. Goodnight, Nurse. [foreboding music] Helen? Oh, Alan. You frightened me. What's wrong? You can see the cottage from here. Oh, is that all? Well, you must learn to look at these things scientifically. Remember the laws of biology. Damn science and blast biology. Can't you put it a little more clearly? Yes, I can. [romantic orchestral music] -Helen? -Yes? -Helen, I'm sorry I did that. -Why? Because I had no right to. You and Perry have made that quite clear. Alan, I didn't kiss George. He kissed me. And perhaps I don't want you to apologize. Don't you? No. Well, well I love you. I love you, too. -Say that again. -I love you. [romantic orchestral music] I'll go and ask your father. -[playful music] -[Helen laughs] [film reel ticking] Could I have a word with you? Oh, hello. Yes, certainly but before you start, do you know why Ernest Forest came here today? No. He came to tell me that my bomb site isn't quite right. Oh, isn't it? No, it appears it needs stabilizing. I [throat clears] I think you did mention it to me. Yes, I did. Yes, well apparently you were right for once. Oh, well look I've got a little thing over here I just worked out. Oh, let's have a look. A guardoscope. -When did you make this Alan? -I just finished it. Oh, well this slots into my bomb site? Yes, it can be switched on at top altitudes. Well, it's exactly what we need. -I'll get 'em to test it out. -Oh, thank you. -Oh, that's all right. -I mean, you're saving me a lot of trouble. If they pass this they'll call it the Barrington-Trently bomb site. Barrington-Trently bomb site? -Well, that's frightfully nice of you. -Oh, no that's all right. I'm only too delighted. After all, we must all work together. [chuckles] Yes. You will take this with you tomorrow won't you? Yes, you bet. -Goodbye. -Bye. I... Could I tell Helen about this? Helen, why Helen? Well, well, well, she... Oh, I see, yes, yes, yes. You tell her by all means and Alan, it's all right with me you know? Oh, fine. Thank you very much. -Goodnight, goodnight. -[equipment clattering] [film reel ticking] -It's all right, Evans. You can lock up now. -Very good, sir. All set? Yes, all set. He's alone. [film reel ticking] -[glass shattering] -[wind whistling] Who's there? -[film reel ticking] -[wind whistling] -[glass shattering] -[Mr. Barrington groaning] [wind whistling] [Evans] Mr. Barrington? [film reel ticking] Mr. Barrington! [film reel ticking] [latches clicking] [door slams] [engine rumbling] [man knocking] [upbeat piano music] ♪ Yes, let me like a soldier I'm sorry to be late. There's a raid on. -Buses won't budge. -Were you invited? Certainly. As a man with a true love of beauty, here I am. Come in. He's not here yet? No, I can't understand it. I thought Berlin was satisfied but now it seems... [knocking] That will be Sarah Trimm. Good evening, I see I'm in good time. I don't seem to know you. This is the Music Box? Yes, it is but the shop's closed and our society is here to rehearse. And I've been sent to join you. Tell me, in the musical world, true love of beauty is the password isn't it? -Won't you come in? -Thanks. Gentlemen, allow me to introduce a distinguished friend. Is everyone present as instructed? -Yes. -And where is, Sarah Trimm? Oh, I forgot about her but she'll be-- Just as you forgot to inform us of the Stealth B Plane Document and the sailing of King George V? Trimm is not here because I ordered her not to come. And it happens that the butler at Freyo is Detective Brownrigg of Scotland Yard. -But I-- -Such gross carelessness is inexcusable. Does the name Von Hellinger mean anything to you? -Yes. -Good. Then we can get down to business. It's an honor to have you here, Herr Hellinger. Von Hellinger. I'm going to investigate the activities of the past few months. After that I shall want to have a talk with you privately. I will question each member separately. I'll begin with you. The others wait outside. [foreboding music] [Norton] If you promise not to shout I'll take this thing off. [spits] I wouldn't waste my breath, what's left of it. You see, I happen to know where I am. [Norton] Oh, you do, eh? Yes, but not who you are or why I'm here or why you're behaving like this. [Norton] Oh, you'll know soon enough. -Oh, Norton? -Uh-huh? -Did you get rid of his car all right? -Yes. -You had any trouble? -No, nothing at all. -[Ronald] Psst! -Ronnie! They're Dimble's gang. Small bloke pinched your car. I hid in the back. I can get you two out of here. -I can find the way back. -I doubt it. It's rough going and you don't strike the road 'til you get. I thought of that. I got a trail fixed up. -A what? -A trail. I threw out your suitcase things. Shirts, pajamas and collars. Oh, thanks very much. However, well done. Look, get a move on. Strike the trail. It's the best part of 30 miles I'm afraid. -Strewth! -How many? -30? -Yes, that's to Freyo. But call at the nearest cottage, ask for help. -Go on, get going. -Okay, Gov. -[foreboding music] -[engine rumbling] Gov, I told you it would work. He's here, you're saved. [Mr. Barrington] Don't be a fool, Ronald. Get back! [foreboding music] I thought I told you not to shout. [dramatic music] -[groaning] -Come on, Mr. Perry! This way! [dramatic music] Good old Spitfire, show him your eight guns. It's all up for you and you know it. He can take you gangsters one handed. Shall I take his gun? I've got his specs. What's up? Well Ronald, how did you get here? -I hid in the car. -Oh, it was clever of you. Anybody else know anything about it? No. Tie him up. But you don't understand, Mr. Perry. He's a crook. He's the man who kidnapped the Gov! -Please, help me! -Shut up! Mr. Perry, you don't understand, he kidnapped the Gov. He's a crook! Here, stop that, Perry, or I'll... Take him away, Hennie. -Gov! -Come on! Or you'll what? I'm giving the orders here, Barrington. God, how you must've enjoyed this! Think so? Would you mind telling me what all this is about? Certainly. -Cigarette? -Thank you. -I'm taking to, got it? -Mm-hm. -Berlin. -Berlin? -Oh, well that's damn funny. -Hm. Glad you find it amusing. Yes, I, thanks, I haven't read my "Oppenheim" lately but don't tell me you're a German spy. Agent. Spies work for the other side. Hm, nice point. When do we start? We leave by sea plane from the loch tomorrow night. You know, your London trip hurried things up a bit. -[Hennie] Now that's fixed him. -Cheer up, Ronald. You can go now, Hennie. There's still 24 hours. You'll never get away with it, you know? What a hope you got, you dirty hun. Why not? You've made everything almost too easy for me. Yes, he's perfectly right. They think I've missed the trai. I generally do, and gone on to London with Evans in the car. Exactly. You'll enjoy your stay in Germany. They're looking forward to your being most helpful. [Mr. Barrington] In what way? Your work. What, work for the blasted Nazis? That's enough, Barrington! See you tomorrow night, Barrington. You won't go away will you? [latch clicks] -Hennie, get on to Glasgow. -Is it the kid? -No. -Anything serious? Might be. Something my sister ought to know about anyway. Go on. [telegraph tapping] Thirdly, your organization has been spending too freely. [Miss Stokes] One can't bargain for information. No, but one can question exorbitant outgoings. Exorbitant. I spend no more than I consider absolutely necessary. -You surly can't think-- -I'm only telling you Berlin's opinion. Fourthly, there's this Barrington job. There I've carried out your plan step by step. Hennie and Norton have both gone to Freyo. Only to find that Barrington has started for London? Started perhaps. By now he should be safely in our care at the mill. You see, we are efficient sometimes. It merely meant advancing our plans 24 hours. On whose authority? My brother's of course. Your brother had no right to interfere with my plan. What else could he do? Let Barrington go? He could've prevented him. Your brother's a fool. -I won't have my brother insulted. -Is there time to stop him? No, they'll have got Barrington by now. But it's only until tomorrow evening if all goes well. Hm. If all goes well. You're thinking of the sea plane on the loch. Naturally. Anyway, I don't like it. There's all tomorrow -and the whole thing is very dangerous. -I don't agree. The mill is miles away from anywhere. There's not even a road to it now. Hm. May I offer you a drink? I'll have a whisky and soda. I said we were not to be disturbed. How ridiculous, of course I can't see him. Will you deal with him yourself? -Say when. -[Dimble] Splash. You know Herr Von Hellinger, your criticism made me begin to doubt my organization. My own abilities in fact. But I don't doubt them any longer. Your whiskey. I think you're going to need it. What is all this? A gathering of the clans? Excuse me. [door creaking] Hm. Yes. We're on the fourth floor you know? -Are we? -Mind if I have a look? -[curtain pole clattering] -[dramatic music] -There it is. -Put out that light! -[dramatic music] -[glass shattering] Shut that door! Stop him! Don't let him go! [dramatic music] -No good, Gov. They're too tight. -Yes. Ronnie, do you see that gadget over there? It's got a knife on it. No good for me, I'm handcuffed. But if I gave you a great shove do you think you could crawl over to it? -I'll have a try. -Go on, have a prod. [groaning] [knife scraping] -That's the stuff. -[Evans groans] Oh, hello, Evans. You all right? Splendid. I'm sorry about all this mess. Do you think you could answer a few questions? You were sent down from Scotland Yard. What for, to protect me? You were tracking someone? -Told you so, Gov. -You didn't. Nevermind that. Let's get on with the grilling. Who was it you were after? -Was it Perry? -Was it Trently? Phew. So it was him, eh? You mean it wasn't Trently? Well, that only leaves Dimble. Is he in on this? Not Dimble either? I think the rope's giving, Gov. There's three of us to two of them. -We gotta fight. -No, I'm afraid not. They're armed and we are handcuffed. We have to rely on you. I wonder what Sherlock Holmes would've done. Think, Ronald. You know his methods. Well, he might've... Yes, I think perhaps he would. You mean the millstone? Yes, I think he'd find that millstone interesting. Very interesting. Collect Mrs. Trimm at number six Mulholland Road. Very good, Sir. She won't answer the door so just go right in. [door latches] You look worried, Inspector. -Aye. -Why did you tell us to let -the chief of this lot get away? -I didn't. But Mr. Dimble, you distinctly said that we were not to stop her. Yes, but it is a him we want. She's only a subordinate. We want a head and she'll lead us to him. -Oh, Reilly? -[Reilly] Sir? Look, I want your help. I want the name of a loch in the neighborhood of Freyo. All I know about it is that there's an old mill on it somewhere. Let me see, it'll be either Loch Katrin or Loch Foley. Why of course, it's Loch Katrin. There's no watermill there. There's not many of them left 'round these parts. -By car? -Oh, about three hours. -Terrible road. -Right. Now collect your men and get going, and you'll need military assistance. For besides your prisoners there will be an enemy plane to collect touching down in the loch tomorrow night at dark. -Off you go. -Leave it to us, sir. And what do we do? We follow Miss Stokes. You know where she's going, too? -I think so. -[phone ringing] It's all right. Hello, yes. She did? The Freyo Road, isn't it? All right, thanks. -Well, it's one of two men. -But you don't know which. No, but we soon will. Come along. -[bagpipe music] -[attendees chattering] [attendees applauding] Ladies and gentlemen... [bagpipe music] Ladies! [throat clears] Ladies and gentlemen, I declare this bazaar well and truly laid. -Oh, thank you. -[attendees applauding] Oh, thank you. Oh, no, no, no. [chuckles] Well, enjoy yourselves everybody. Spend a lot of pennies. Thank you very much. That was very nice. [attendees chattering] Are you sure Ronald went to town with my father this morning? Positive. I saw them leave together. You must've been up early. Yes, I was. Like the vase? -No, thank you. -All right. -Hello, Mother darling. -Hello, dear. How do you do? How do you do, Lady Maclntyre? Oh, we mustn't miss the children singing. Madam. Sir, I'm engaged. That makes it all the more interesting. I say, you could lay a table on that couldn't you? Oh, well let's go and play some darts.
