At Five in the Afternoon Ah, that fatal five in the afternoon! It was five by all clocks! It was five in the shade of the afternoon! It was five in the shade of the afternoon! Oh God forgive my sins! Tell pious men to close their eyes on women and control their lust. That is more chaste. God is aware of their actions and women stamp not their feet on the ground, lest their hidden beauties become evident. Oh, God forgive my sins! Schoolgirls must wear black dress and white scarf. Why have you put on a colored dress, Noqreh? - Madam? - What? Madam, if I wear a uniform my father won't let me come to school. Why? He believes women shouldn't go to school. Why not? Sit down! The Department of Education has sent a notice for us to ask students about their future careers. For example those who want to be teachers raise your hands. Thanks. Put down your hands. Now those who want to be engineers please stand! Those who want to contribute more to the country and who want to be doctors do the same! Sit down please! Most importantly, who wants to be Afghanistan's next president? Afghanistan's next president. Very well! How can an Afghan woman in a burka with a child become president? Have you seen a childless woman? People won't choose a woman to be president! But she's worthy and capable of becoming president. A burka won't stay on us forever and the child will grow up! Did you ever study women's history? Do you understand? Your parents don't let you go to school or wear a uniform. How can you become president? A wise and brave girl chooses for herself. I made my decision. I made my decision and it's none of my family's business. We are Muslims. A Muslim girl can never rise up and declare herself president. Have you ever seen a Muslim woman president? Her eminence Ayesheh, the Prophet's wife? Not every woman can be her! Why can men be president but not women? I lost my father and brothers in a male-ruled regime, not a women-ruled government! I lived in Pakistan for a few years. Binazir Butto was premier there. Remember India's premier was a woman: Indira Gandhi? She said women could rule for generations. She spoke well and worked for people. We're not other countries. We're talking about Afghanistan. When Binazir Butto was the premier, though a woman herself, she created the anti-women Taliban here and destroyed the society. Binazir Butto was for the Taliban. When she was president the Taliban were against woman. That's your opinion. If I become president I'll treat people kindly. I'll laugh, because if I cry from my sorrows everyone will get sad and cry. No one understands the pain of losing a family unless they experience the same misery. I lost my father and brother. Kabul has so many problems. What's wrong with Afghan women? Girls weren't allowed in school. Women had to stay home and couldn't work. Afghan women were completely oppressed! Especially how girls couldn't go to school! We were deprived of education. Men are women's guardians, for God created some superior to others. Take the bucket and bring some water. The well's dried up! Leylomah, any news of your husband? No one's had any news. What can I do? My milk's dried up and they baby is dying of hunger and disease. Let's take her to the doctor. We have no place. Everywhere is ruined. There's nowhere left to live. Follow me if you want to live in ruins! Do you know if Pakistan's president is a man or a woman? I don't want to answer that question. Why not? I don't like politics. I'm after real life. You were in Pakistan a long time. Why don't you know the answer? Does it matter if I know? Does it have anything with me? I'd like to know if it's a woman or a man. Ask someone else. I don't want to answer you. Do you know, Madam? No, I don't know anything. I was a beggar in Pakistan. My son was killed. I have a daughter-in-law and two grandchildren. I'm illiterate. My unfortunate mother had four sons. One was killed in the Russian assault, one in the civil war and one by the Taliban. I'm the only one left alive. See what shape she's in. This is all politics! Look there. They're not here. Look, that one. Give back our hen! That hen is ours. We've offered you shelter, and now you're accusing us of stealing your hen? It was a little egg that I fed and raised with no bread for myself and now you want me to give it to you? Why are you lying? See my white hair? I'm not lying. I offered shelter, now you're stealing our hen? Her baby is sick. Give it back. What are you saying? Why are you wrongly accusing us? We offer you shelter and you accuse us. I raised the little chick. Will you swear it's yours? No, I won't. The chicken is ours! It's ours, ours! Which school do you go to? Qaleh Qazi Will they register me too? Why not? What's the address? It's far. Don't worry, I know that school. I'll take your daughter there. Stay with other refugees. This room is too small for us and you're a stranger. My husband's not here and my baby is sick. I don't have enough food. I can't share the room with you. Take one half and we'll live in the other. Don't put up a curtain! We won't leave. We'll have fights everywhere. Live together. Don't ruin the ruins more. Look Noqreh! They put up a curtain in our room! What? They're living in our room! What should I do? Sir Would you take us to Barchi field? Veil your face and I'll take you. OK, we will. Cover up. It's sinful. Veil your face Don't talk to strangers. - Do you understand? - Yes If you have to, put your finger in your mouth so your voice won't sound feminine, because it's sinful Don't end up in hell for this world. Do you hear? Don't remove your veil. OK Why did you reveal your face? Get out. Stop. Get out! Why are you doing that? You're not taking the short way to heaven but the long one to hell?! We'll split up here. I found your hen. You shouldn't accuse others. Oh God, forgive my sin. You listen to music all the time. So inconsiderate of your neighbor! Everyone's entitled to his own faith. Be reasonable and I'll listen. I told you I wouldn't change this music for the world. Why don't you listen to me? I wouldn't change it. What kind of a Muslim are you? I am the devil but kinder than you. I'm shivering cold but you're in a warm room. Your prayers five times a day is all lies. Sell your music and get warm clothes. I listen to this music either to force you out or myself. What life is this, listening to music all day? I am alive with this music and won't leave unless I make you go. You can't make me go! This music will! If I raise it a little you'll get lost. I turned to the devil. You'll surely get expelled too! I won't! OK, tell me if you don't. Papa, we left so suddenly. If Akhtar comes he won't find us. He will have to search for us throughout the city Oh God, what can I do? What can I do? Stop! Do you know the night password? No. He doesn't know the password. Bring him down! Who's the man? He's my father-in-law. We're Lookingfor a house, some shelter. In the middle of the night? We don't have anywhere. What's under your burka? Don't be afraid. It's my baby. She's terribly sick. We're hungry and thirsty. Where are you going? Nowhere. - What's under your burka? - My umbrella. - Any arms? - No Show me...! Show me...! Open! And hold it over your head! Where were you going in the middle of the night? Looking for a house. At 12 o'clock midnight?! I have two women with me. What's their relation to you? Stop... Don't move... Sit down. I brought you water. Noqreh, the chicken didn't lay an egg today. Baby is very hungry. - She didn't? - No - What did Papa bring? - Nothing Feed her. No milk. She sucks but there's no milk. You don't have any milk and the chicken didn't lay any eggs. She'll get sicker! It's no use her sucking my breast. - No milk? Not even a drop? - I haven't eaten anyhting to produce milk. Yesterday I asked the truck drivers about Akhtar. What am I going to do if he doesn't show up? No one's had any news. No one knew where he was? Father, let me go and Look for Akhtar today. I'll go myself. Advise women whose opposition and obstinacy you fear. Punish them and avoid them in bed and don't chastise them as long as they obey you! Hello What are you doing here? I want to register my mother. To register her in school? Just kidding. I brought my neighbor's daughter. He registers the girls he likes. You trouble your mother for schoolgirls? He has to choose one. Ride her on your bike. she'll get tired. It's OK. I'll walk with him anywhere. I did but she fell. Now her feet hurt. I'm taking her to the doctor. Where did you skip to last night? My dad tookus away. He doesn't like noise and women living next to strangers. He is such a bigot, we can't argue otherwise. You brought us in your home but left yourself? You are comfortable though. You left us all alone. That's unfair. Did you hear the news last night? What news? Binazir Butto nominated herself for presidency again. Really? What was her speech? Will she really be a candidate? It wasn't broadcast. They just said she's a candidate. Can you please find her speech for me? Binazir Butto's or any president's? Better it's a woman president's speech. Do you want to become president? Not yet. I want it for school. I like to know what they say to make people vote for them. Why people like them? Maybe I'll find it. Let's go, Mom! Let's go. My feet hurt badly. What would you do for women if you became president, Noqreh? Tell me! Girls didn't go to school for five years during the Taliban. What will be your plan? If I became president I'd ask the education minister to extend things and make up for the delay in women's studies so that they become teachers, so a 20-year old like me doesn't sit with a 12-year old. I will ask Mina a question A rocket killed your father. You are alone, have to make a living on the street. The Taliban whipped you. If you become president, what will you do with that Taliban? What will you do with the Taliban in general? If I become president I will bring him here, the one who killed my father. I know him now. He's a coachman. When I was in the market he whipped me. If I said what he did to me he wouldn't live a second, but I forgive him. What will you do with the Taliban in general? If I become president I will not allow them in my regime. I won't take revenge. I won't kill them. The three people on the stage, they'll present their plans tomorrow for us to choose one. Later we'll recommend them to the Department of Education. This is an exercise in democracy. You shouldn't just think of house chores, but be active outside. Hi. I only found Karzai's speech. Karzai's speech! Thanks a lot but... Please don't show up here. People will talk about us! Presidents are always conservative! People will gossip about us. Thanks again. Bye! Please don't follow me! People will gossip! Please don't follow me! Presidents don't beg. Just order and I'll obey. OK. I order you not to come! Father! Papa, they are forcing their way in! Ask the drivers if they have news of Akhtar. Do you know Akhtar? Have you seen Akhtar? - What does he do? - He's a truck driver. How tall is he? Average, green eyes and called Akhtar. - Did you just come from Pakistan? - Yes Is their premier a man or a woman? I don't know. We said our prayers five times and fasted. We are illiterate. I was 7 when we migrated to Pakistan by mules. There I had my kids. When the planes bombarded we took refuge in mountain caves. We were full one day and hungry another. What was he doing? His car flipped but he was OK. Don't worry. - Was he wounded? - Yes But don't worry. I saw him. He'll be here in 2 days. We were very worried. He'll be released from the hospital soon. Thanks. Don't worry! May I take the ewer, Papa? I'll bring it after I go to the toilet. Here you are Did you go to school or not, Noqreh? Yes the principal told me to wear a uniform but if Papa finds out he'll get mad. I don't like this. He never consents to women going to school or working. What should I do? Oh, God save me! Let me pray! What's all the noise, kids? Pack everything. We'll be leaving. Leylomah, I'm Looking for water. I haven't found any. Papa. I'm Looking for water for your horse, But there's no water here. Noqreh! Yes Papa. Did you find water? No, I hear the sound of water but no water. Look for water but be careful of mines. Did you find water, Noqreh? No Papa, I hear the sound but no water here. Noqreh! I washed the clothes. Bring some water so I can wash the baby. Where did you get water for your sheep? The creek behind the palace. -Is there a creek? -Yes Look. The whole city is profane. Let me bring you hay. You're a horse and don't understand. You're an animal. The world is infested with profanity. What do you know? You're an animal. You don't understand. I, I know. People have been killed. The country is ruined. Are you cold? Let me cover you. It'll be my fault if you catch cold. Look at all the unveiled women! The world's become profane. You're an animal. Don't know the difference between faith and profanity. The only thing you need is eating hay. I'm going to get the hay. I'm tired of you too. How will we end up? She may catch cold. You'll get warm, dear. Hello, sir. How are you? I'm Noqreh What's your name? What? What's your name? Jerome. What? Jerome. Jerome. I'm Afghanistani. Where are you from? I'm French. France. Who is your president? - President's name? - What? President's name? - My president's name? - Yes, yes - He is Mr. Chirac. - What? Mr. Chirac. - Mr. Chirac. - Yes. Thanks. Stop! What do you want to do? Hi. I'm her friend. Go back! Ask him how their president gave speeches. Can I be her translator? Please, ask what their president said to make people elect him? What makes him be a president? I don't know. He says he doesn't know. He doesn't know. OK. Then ask him why people voted for him? Why did you vote for him? I can't say. I'm just a soldier. I'm not involved in politics. What's he saying? He's a soldier and doesn't want to answer. But I know the story. People didn't like Chirac's rival so they had no choice. Sorry, why are you here? Me? Because of you Why are you here? Me? Because she will be next president of Afghanistan Really? Yes. - What's he doing? - He gave a military hail. Do the same. In your country, is the president good at words... or at military hail? He'd better be in a party so that people will support him. Then he can reduce taxes and be popular. He says, run a propaganda campaign to get people to vote for him. I have no money. I will go to a friend's home to take a photo. Pay him later. You'd better go now because they will come to control this district. Let's go. Let's take photos. What post will you give me when you become president? You'll be my chauffer. That's so generous of you! If you don't like it then I'll drive. You be the president. I didn't mean that, but give me a job. Then what do you want to be? Is head of military good? Our problem always is that no one is in the right place! I'm a poet and have no relation to military. -Are you a poet? -Yes. If you are a poet... OK I'll make you head of campaign. When you are president, your name means silver turns to gold. But I should remain in my last position? I'll be the driver. You be the president. No, thanks. I think you want to be the premier. Or my personal consultant. When I turn to gold, choose any post you want. Smile! And fix your earring OK, Take it now. I'll take it but paper is expensive. It'll cost more. OK. Just take the picture. I'll pay for the paper. Attention! Take it. Look in the camera! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... that's it! Why all the pictures? Good pose. Take another one. Paper is expensive. I have no money but I'll pay you later. Look in the camera. Done. What are all these pictures for? She wants to become president. Her! She wants to become president? Very funny! Not now. It's for a school's president. I want to be a school president. That's for now. But she wants to be like Binazir Butto. Her! A woman president! What are you saying? Just take the picture! Look at the camera. Don't move... 1, 2, 3... done. When I was in Pakistan Binazir Butto was watching a parade... I say it for the good of you, sister. Her kids were behind with their granny. People were laughing and confused if she was the premier or her husband. Good that women gave birth to men. Otherwise you would say we were incapable of that too. Now frown. Good. Pull your burka over. Don't laugh. Some vote for a serious frowning person. You're taking so many pictures. Binazir Butto didn't take as many pictures as this lady! In Afghanistan it's unknown whether people vote for a smiling person or a frowning one. So smile for one. Take another picture. Politics is serious and wild. To get people to vote for her. So frown. Straight. Now don't smile or frown. Be neutral. Veil. Veil your face. This is the best picture. Done. Women should be at home to iron, sweep and cook. People will laugh at a pregnant woman who is president, viewing a military parade. Just take the picture. Get your money! Where are you going? Noqreh, where are you going? Noqreh! Noqreh! Wait! You're too impatient to be president. What did I say to upset you? This is Afghanistan here. How many women in Europe and America have become president? Don't be upset. Give me an important post and I'll take you seriously. Wait! I know you're not speaking to me but at least look at the pictures and choose one for the campaign. In God's name. Think not that those who die in the path of God are dead. What's going on? Mina was killed. She was killed?! No, not at all They are alive and earn a living with God. Will you go up to the ruins? Come up. Get in, girls. Where are you going? The whole city is blasphemous. Women dwell in the streets unveiled. We're leaving here for a real Islamic city. I prefer to die there. Your son trod on a mine and got killed! It occurred in a dusty street. Hi. How are you? Why do you have my pictures up here? I'm preparing the grounds for your speech. Have a good talk. If my dad sees it he'll get mad at me! The pictures look really good. I can only speak to myself. I'm afraid to speak to people. I get breathless. My heart beats and I get nervous. No, I can't speak to people. Wait for me, you must rehearse a lot for a good speech. Prepare well. Presidents who give good speeches practice a lot. Have you heard? Practice makes perfect? Wait. Let me tell you a secret. But how did they give a speech the first time? Very easily. I heard many presidents talk to cows and sheep first. When lecturing people, they see them as cows and sheep. Let me tell you another secret. Me, too. I read my poems to cows and sheep before I read them to people. Cows and sheep don't understand poems! Poets are inspired by nature and nature well understands herself. I want you to read this poem. I have a poem by a Spanish poet who wrote it for the death of a cow. He really liked cows and sheep and poems. At Five in the Afternoon. It was exactly five in the afternoon. The rest was death and death alone. Son, I promised you. You don't keep the promise. I don't want to listen to the damn poem. I want to learn to cry like a river. Take away the corpse of the ox by a soft cloud and deep river. Afterwards, we don't know ox nor fig tree and horse nor ants in your home because you have died forever. Ah, that fatal five in the afternoon! It was five by all clocks. It was five in the shade of the afternoon. "It was five in the shade of the afternoon" My child, I brought you to confide in you. What do you know of my heart? I can't sigh that my daughter-in-law will know of her husband's death and that her baby's become fatherless. You can't understand this. You only know hay and barley. Did you sigh when your mate died? How did you sigh? Don't worry! Because how hard it is, not to sigh. But how hard it is to sigh! Were you told of your partner's death or did you find out yourself? Wrap yourself tightly so baby doesn't catch cold. She's not crying. She doesn't take milk either. What can I do Papa? We shouldn't have left the city now. If my husband comes how can he find us? He'll look all over town in vain. What can he do? We should've waited for him. Then we could have left with him. Look Papa, do you hear me? If my husband comes into town he won't find us. Then we'll lose each other. Do you hear me? The horse is hungry. The load is too much and the cart is in pieces. Poor horse is suffering a lot. A lot. I'll get off to save the horse. Papa, Papa, baby's not crying. Because she's asleep. She's not moving either. It's cold and she fell asleep. Papa, what will I do if she dies? Noqreh, touch the baby. She's frozen. See her hand. It's never been this cold. Her whole body is frozen. It's too frozen. Touch her and look at her. My child, my grandchild is frozen. How can I make a fire? You only understand hay and barley. Don't cry. Leylomah. Not everyone in deep sleep is dead. I say she's not dead. She'll wake up some time. Leylomal. Don't cry. She's not dead. She'll wake up some time. Leylomah. Look in the distance! God has sent someone for us. Maybe he can help us. Don't veil yourself. He is an old man. Hello. Hello dear. Do you have any water? There's a dry tree on the hill with a little water. Go get some, Noqreh. Give some water to the animals. Leylomah. Where were you going? Kandahar. Why did your mule die? Thirst and hunger. Now he's dying. We travelled together for four months. Now he's dying. I'm going to... where am I going? To Kandahar. No water or villages on the way and I lost my way. Why were you going to Kandahar? I was going to Mola Omar. The wise are having a meeting about whether or not to turn Bin Laden over to the Americans. I can't agree to turn this Muslim over to pagan America. You're very late. Bin Laden is our guest and shouldn't be killed by pagans. You're late, dear. Go back the way you came. America invaded Afghanistan! Bin Laden and Mola Omar escaped. Kabul is blasphemous. As if - God forbid - God is dead. Oh, God forgive me. God's rage has descended. Kabul is close to being devoured and burying all the people at once. God doesn't die. God doesn't die. Mules die, an ox dies seas dry up, seas die. The whole town is blasphemous. As if God's become profane. Oh God, take back what you gave. Nothing! There's no town to ask how far is left! I'm lost. I'm lost! No town any more. There's no one to ask so I'll sit right here, forever. Ah, that fatal five in the afternoon! It was five by all clocks! It was five in the shade of the afternoon. It was five in the shade of the afternoon. Starring: Agheleh Rezaie Starring: Abdolgani Yousefrazi Starring: Marzieh Amiri Directed by Samira Makhmalbaf Writing credits: Mohsen Makhmalbaf
