-Hello, Johnny. -Hi. Soon as my Dad gets back to work, I'm going to get a neat gas job. Like the one we saw at the show. Remember, Johnny? Wasn't it me that showed it to you? -Bertis, you're putting the wing wrong. -Lay off. I know what I'm doing. -What's that gadget on the side for? -That's a skyhook. What's a skyhook? Run along, Rita Belle. Can't you see I'm busy? Let Johnny put that wing on. It's going to crack up. So what? I'll buy a new one. You forget his old man's a cop. There's nothing to do but clip coupon off. -What do you mean? -Nothing. Don't let that stop you to make a thing. Johnny, look what you're doing. -Are hurt dear? -No, I'm just mad. You might at least say you're sorry. Sorry for what? You'd no business hanging around here in the first place. Johnny, that's no way to talk to Rita Belle. You don't know women. If you're nice they ruin you. -Isn't that right, fellas? -That's right. That reminds me, what about that promise you made? Gee, can't a guy even have some fun? I want you to have fun, but you vowed to do the homework first then play. -I'm going to quit school and go to work. -You're what? I could help out a lot. You think I like loafing around and see you doing it all. Johnny, nobody's loafing when he's trying to learn something. Anybody can get a job, sweeping out an office or carrying somebody else's bag. But a two-bit boy usually grows up to be a two-bit man, and I want you to do better than that. -Soon maybe I'll be getting married. -Oh, congratulations. Well, you know how girls are. You focus on your books for a while longer and don't worry about anything else. Dad will get something soon. -I forgot to tell you. He's got a job. -You mean it? Yeah. A fella come round offering jobs, and he gave Mom this card to give to Dad. Chick Riley, Private Detective Agency. Do you ever hear about it? -What's the matter, Kay? -We'll see about this. Kay. My goodness. Why do you have to come in like a cyclone? Where's Dad? Well, it's only 4:00. What are you doing home so early? Don't worry, I didn't get fired. Tell me, where's Dad? Why are you looking at me that way for? -You sent him to that factory. -What if I did? A job's a job. Be grateful to keep pushing your father about work for, your sake as well as mine. Goodness knows I don't expect much. Just a room and food for you and Johnny. You know they're having a strike there. Strike or not, he's right to think of us. He's got a right to think of himself, too. He won't be able to face his friends. It'll break him. He's not the kind of a man to scab. You'd have known it than to make him go. I'd have done this or that. Everything I do around here is wrong. Oh, I know I'm in the way. There should be a law, when parents get over 40, their children should shoot them and be done with it. Can't you see he might be killed? Go on! Go on! Call me a murderer. -Oh, Mom, quit acting. -Acting? I'm not thinking that you accuse me of acting. Everyone knows how you treat your mother. I shouldn't wonder. Well, let's forget about it. Paul'll be coming for me soon. Help me clean up the room a little bit. It's so hot and I work so hard. It's like we won't get anything done. -New hat. -Yes, I couldn't resist it. Johnny stored it for me, it was marked down. I suppose it's all right, but I've been washing dishes with torn rubber gloves to save a quarter. You know, my hands are all I have left to care about. I'll get you some new gloves, Mom. -Paul got a raise today. -Mm-hmm. We'll celebrate. That's where I got the new hat. Seems like you'll neglect your duty to your family and get married. No. I'll be sticking around for a little while. -I better hurry and get dressed. -Was it a nice raise Paul got? -Ten dollars. -Now, isn't that grand? Ma, you look just like a movie star. Yeah. -Where's Kay? -In her room. Kay, your heartbeat's downstairs. Tell him to come up I compliment him on raise. Maybe that's why he don't want to come up. Johnny, tell Paul I'll be right down. I'll tell him. -How are you, Paul? -Hello, Mrs. Boylan. Kay just told me the good news. -About Kay and me? -No, about your raise. Time's too hard to be thinking about marriage. You don't know when you try to keep home. If I liked to tell about my troubles, I could tell… People seem to get along somehow, Mrs. Boylan. That's what you young people think. It's keeping things from Kay that's giving me my gray hairs. Saving her the worry about money, pinching and scraping, stalling off this one and that one. Would five dollars help any, Mrs. Boylan? No, would be a drop in the bucket. I need ten. But why should you? Oh, that's all right. Look, I'll let you have the ten dollars. After all, I did get a raise. Yes, I know. Hello, Paul. Have a good time, children. Okay, mum. I know a grand place to go, good food and a small orchestra. -Well, I… -What's the matter, Paul? When I was about to leave the office, a fellow, nice chap, said he was in a spot and could I let him have ten dollars? -Kay, where are you going? -To the guy you lent ten dollars to. I'll be back with that money in a minute. Let's take the special dinner, it's cheap. Talk louder. I can't hear you. People will hear me. -What people? -The waiter, silly. We have a special, we get champagne. My $40 weekly, we can keep bottles of champagne on ice all the time. -We'll have enough left over for a movie. -Well, two movies a week anyway. Idiot, I'm talking about tonight. And I'm talking about the rest of our lives. I've just discovered something very important? What? That all the hats of season are cockeyed until you get your face under them. You're talking crazy but I love it. When I head the credit at Tracy's Incorporate… Well, I can be too. When you're the head of our incorporate… Look honey, let's not talk about that tonight. Let's just have fun. That's how I have my fun, dreaming and planning about us. But I think we better lay off that Mr. and Mrs. angle for a while. Now, don't tell me there's a family in your life. Kay, they can't mean more than us. We can wait a little while, Paul. Can't we? Try to see it my way? -I understand. -Can you wait a bit longer for the girl? You think you can go for a guy with a long white beard? His face is so cut out. -The street… -There's no money for the doctor. I'm sorry, but I didn't want to go down there in the first place. I'm almost through, Pa. Just be quiet, it won't hurt much. I wouldn't have stayed. I didn't want to come home without a job. Kay, your father's been hurt. Hurry, Kay! Hurry! Dad, what happened? -Oh, Dad. -Hello, Kay. I don't know. Some guy in the picket line got knocked down with a rock, and I jumped in to help him. Then this goon was standing over me with a lead pipe in his hand, so I got it away from him. I must have started hitting out with it, and I can't remember after that. All right, darling. -Yeah. -Don't try to tell me now. Jim Boylan live here? Yeah, sure. What's the matter? I've a warrant for his arrest. Arrest? What's the charge? Murder. Oh! Murder! Please don't take him. Please. He didn't do anything. Oh, Dad. You leave me alone! Sir, I said you leave me alone! Leave him alone! -No! -Johnny! -Let me go! -Johnny, please. They can't take him from Ma. -Johnny, he's going to be all right. -No, they can't take him! -Johnny. -Let me go! Let me go! Jim Boylan held for murder. They'll give it to him. I'm kind of sorry for Johnny. I'm not. He always was a wise guy. This will take him down. Come on. How come you guys didn't wait for me this morning? Come on. Why don't you say something? After last night we didn't figure you'd come to school. What's that got to do with me? Nothing? Some guys have to have a house fall on them before they can take a hint. Watch out what you say about us. See, I'm not saying anything, all I do is read the newspapers. He didn't do anything wrong. Understand? That's funny. He only killed a guy, that's all. He killed a guy. Next time don't start something you can't finish. I just hope your old man has a good lawyer. Come on, fellas. Come on. James Boylan, you have been found guilty of murder in the first degree. All my life I tried to be a good wife and mother. Now we're ruined. -Rioting, fighting, murder. -Mom, how could you say such things? Well, it comes to that. Guilty. We're ruined in this place, ruined in place. Oh, Jim, my poor husband. Don't worry, Mrs. Boylan. We'll fight for a new trial. In the meantime, what will we survive on? The lawyers have taken everything. Paul, can't you do something? Can't you borrow money? Mom, stop that. Paul's done everything. It's no time to be proud. Of course not. I'll do everything I can. Paul, we ought to get a new lawyer. When they put Dad on the stand he never said more than yes or no. -They've railroaded him. They did that. -Johnny, that's no way to feel or talk. Come on, let's go home. What did the lawyer say? To keep your fingers crossed and hope for a miracle. -Goodnight, Kay. -Night, Molly. Love letter for you, Miss Boylan. Oh, Mr. Randall, please. Yes, Miss Boylan. This note is to get my time. I don't understand. I'm very sorry, but its meaning is clear. But I've done my work and my sales have held up. You haven't had any fusses from customers, have you? I'm very sorry, Miss Boylan. It's late, Kay. You get some rest, I'll see you tomorrow. I'm going to be busy tomorrow, looking for a new job. You won't be busy in the evening. Can't you see it's no use, Paul. If you stick with me, you'll go down, you'll get lost, and we'll end up bitter and defeated like Mom and Dad. -You got it all figured out, haven't you? -Yes. I've done some figuring, but I get a different answer. It's no good, Paul. Kay, you're not really serious. Terribly serious. Please go, Paul. Maybe you'll be moving back soon. Maybe. Anyway, you'll be coming back sometime, won't you? What for? Well, to see me. People don't just move away and never come back. They do if they're not wanted. Then you'll be coming back. Oh, is that so? There's nobody around here I'd come back for. Then I'll come to see you. Well, that's if I need you to do something for me. If I'd ever do anything for somebody, I'd do it. This's the last of it. Your Ma wants you to come us. Pile in the back. All right. Goodbye, Johnny. Goodbye, Rita Belle. Goodbye, Johnny. Hey, you kids, get out of the street. -Somebody's going to get killed. -So what? Pull on your knob bottle top before we swamp all over you. Don't waste breath on that slut. Can't you just see from the lower classes? Come on there, fresh guys, get going. Get out of here. Get away you dirty little thieves. You, get away. -Should I'll get the policeman. -I heard you! Fresh vegetables, very nice fresh vegetables. Fresh fruit is coming today. -What's good today? -We got nice carrots. Nice fresh potatoes, onions. We got… Please, don't handle the fruit. Nobody's handle but me the fruit. Everything is going to be clean. -String beans? -No. -Head cabbage? -No. For you, I got something special. How's it by the nice, fresh bunch of asparagus? Huh? All right, wrap it up. Okay. Twenty-eight change, please. Asparagus is only $0.20. But the lettuce is $0.08. Am I too inquisitive? Give the money, please. Wait. I'm going to give you your change. You only change asparagus. What? Where are my frankfurters? -I've been robbed. -Look in your other packets. You think we ought to save bolognese for Pig? You give him, he gives me nothing. -Except the buck on the nose. -Shut up. Do zero for nobody, you'll have time to do something for you. -That's my motto. -Hey, get a load of this. Hello, gorgeous. -She didn't hear me. -She didn't look or listen? No girl wants a little runt. You've heard of a guy named Napoleon? -Are you nuts? -Nice. Nice. -Hi, Pig. -Hi, Pig. -What are you hiding? -Nothing, nothing. Nothing, huh? What's the idea of holding out? I'll slap you all over the joint. That goes for the rest of you. Hey, you. What do you want? Come here. All right. -Your name is Boylan, ain't it? -So what? -Where are you from, apple-head? -Who wants to know? He's from Park Avenue. Can't you see? Oh, a debutante. You and him must get along because your old man's in the same store with his. Yeah. My old man's there for 20 years. Gee, that's a long time. Well, mine don't have to stay that long. But that's only seven with good conduct. He can do that on one side. What's yours in for? -Murder. -Gee. Oh shit. Boylan, and that's in your favor. You're new here, we can't let you put anything over on us. Just mind your own business and you won't get hurt. Come on guys. Hey, fellas, watch this. That's my sister. You cut that out! Oh, a tough guy, huh? Come on, I'll take you one at a time. Johnny, come here this minute. Oh, save me from that nasty man. -I'm so scared. -It's a match to see who cracks him first. What's the matter with you? You're still champ. You're talking wacky again? Leave him alone, Pig. You beat lumps on his head every day, but it does no good. Johnny, when you stood up for me from that mob of kids I was proud of you. You're a lot like Dad. You have his courage. Yeah. He wasn't afraid of anything, except Mom. She used to scare the daylights out of him. Johnny, you're the man of the family now, and I'm counting on you. I have to get a job. I'll sell papers. Lots of big men started that way. I've got a hunt someday I'm going to be awfully proud of you. Maybe we can get away from here before Dad gets up. He never finds out about this dump. Just suppose he… he doesn't get a new trial. They would kill him. Paper. Paper. Paper. Paper. Paper. Get your first sheet. Paper, mister. Paper. Paper, mister. Paper Lady. Paper. Get your extra, paper. Bus-stop final edition over here today. -Hey you. -What? These are Pig's papers. -If you don't know, this's Pig's corner. -I know. It was Dopey's corner before that, Ape's corner before that. -But it's my corner now. See? -Okay. Lovers' quarrel ends in blazing horror. Paper. Lovers' quarrel ends in blazing horror. Paper. Paper. Paper. Read all about it. Lovers' quarrel ends in blazing horror. Paper. Paper. Paper. Here. Get your paper here. Paper, mister? Paper. Paper here. Get your paper just now. Paper, lady. Paper. Paper here, just out. Get it over here. Come on, Johnny. Come across that dough and make it fast. What if I don't want it? Come on. Give him all. Come on, Pig, let him have it. Come on you guys, take a powder, would you? -Why won't you tell me you could fight? -I figured you'd find out. -Will I have a shiner? -Maybe a little one. I'm out. -You hate yourself. -Pig never touched you. -Hey, Johnny. -What? -Here. -Oh, thanks. String, all you do for me, do for Johnny. -Get that? -All double? -That's it. Everything double. -Okay. Pig, I think there's enough business around here for both of us. -Yeah? -Go on, pick up your papers. -You mean it? -Go on. Sure, Johnny. Here paper. Get your paper. Night edition. Paper, miss. Get your paper. Here paper. Paper here. Johnny, go wash the dishes. -This heat is killing me. -Lay off me, will you, Mom? I got to go meet the gang. -Hello, Johnny. -Oh, hi. -Why rush? -See you later. I'm rushing. You ain't busy to talk to your pal, are you? Look, I told you I'm in a rush. See, I got things to do. I got guys waiting for me. All right, Johnny. So long. -Good afternoon, Mrs. Boylan. -Oh, it's you. Where have you been? Nowhere. Just laying low waiting for that break. -Still in the office? -Yes. Well, I'm on layoff. Sort of a vacation. Paid vacation is wonderful. I had one once up in Maine. You ever been there? No, I haven't. -Is Kay… -Well, you sure ought to go. Hey, do you like blueberry pie? Well, that's the place to get it. Can I go for some blueberry pie right now? I saw that lawyer lately, he seems very optimistic about the new trial. He makes his living out of being optimistic. It ain't him that's sitting in the death house. -How's Kay, Mrs. Boylan? -Oh, you Kay's boyfriend? What are you asking about her for? I thought you two chose to split up. It wasn't definitely set, at least not as far as I'm concerned. I wish she'd marry someone. Should be the death of me if she don't. I always say marry young. Stay out of trouble that way. First she lost her job, couldn't find another one for love or money. Then she started spending every minute of the day wrangling about the lawyer until I told her, if she didn't stop fooling and get some kind of a job, I'd work myself. Where is Kay? Working? You'd never guess. She's with Goodwin's Follies. Can you imagine my Kay on the stage? That's a burlesque house, isn't it? Yes, but I always say, if a girl had the right bring-up, she's safe anywhere. -No doubt. -I'll tell Kay you were here. Yes. Do that. That was a quick one to give you. Hello, Paul. How's everything? All right. How are things with you? Oh, I managed to get by. Well, I've to run now, Paul, with Dot. -It's been also good to see you. -I can see that. -Really has, Paul, but I simply must go. -Just a minute. -I want to talk to Kay if you don't mind. -Mind? Me, mind? Who do you think you are ordering me around? Wait for me in the car, Dot, I won't be long. All right. -Hello. -Hi, Dot. How are you? Kay, do you mean to tell me you are really going out with that crowd? I don't see anything wrong with them. -Maybe I'm wrong. -Maybe. Come back again some night, Paul. Any night. I suppose that's my cue to feel hurt and say, "Goodbye. Have a good time." You did that very well. It hurt. I'm sorry. I didn't come down here to quarrel. I saw Johnny today. He's changed from the kid I used to know. That's to be expected. You've changed too. So have I. If we know that, what's to keep from getting out of this place before we're… before it's too late. Why try to fool ourselves, Paul? You're a person that likes to build air castles. That's swell. I love you for it. But where I'm going, the best we could do would be a mud pie now and then. I wouldn't want that. What do you expect me to do? Stand aside and watch you play the martyr. You know, Kay, we don't live forever. We've got to demand things of life. The world won't stop and wait for us. Sounds swell, but as far as I'm concerned, the world can go up in flames and all of us with it. Kay! Wait! Hey, you. You flipped it at the right call. Are you goofy? Do you think I'd cheat for a nickel? I'm so not low. You're so low you could crawl under a snake. Do you want to get knocked off? Call it a misplay. It's a misplay. Misplay? What do you mean? Mr. Boylan, there's a lady to see you. Quit jokes, will you? Son of lover, Johnny, a dame looking for you. -A little dame but a nifty. -Yeah, man. A neat little job. Not you for the tootsie. Hey Dopey, give me that nickel. Hello, Johnny. Hello. What are you doing down here, Rita Belle? Well, you never come to see anybody, so I came down. I happen to be on the street. Why aren't you glad to see me? Yeah, sure. But you know girls ain't supposed to go tagging after boys. I'm not tagging, Johnny Boylan. Besides, that's very old-fashioned. Wait a minute. Here, Rita Belle, it's maple pecan. Well, thanks, Johnny. See, you remember my favorite kind. Nah, it's all they had. Well, goodbye. Do I have to go already? You see, I have to get down to my business now pretty quick. Oh, well, what kind of business, Johnny? -Just paper business. -Oh, that's grand. Johnny, if you are on that street like I was now, well, you know… Yeah, I know. Sure. Well, goodbye. -Goodbye, Johnny. Thanks for the cone. -Goodbye. Oh, deary me. Just wait and see. Love is so wonderful. Come fly with me. I'll take you one at a time. Where it's free. Where it's free. Read all about it, an open house. Where it's free. Come and get it. Hey, fellas, get along with this. -What is it? -Open house. Young American Onward and Upward League, 2172 Winter Street. Today, 2:30. Music. Get together and refreshments. Now dear radio audience, you boys, members, and friends of the Onward and Upward League, who are so close to my heart, I have seen our movement grow from the teeniest idea to what it is today. We are all brothers. That's why we're gathered here today from every part of the city. It isn't where you live or the kind of clothes you wear, it's the way you live. The thing is to do whatever you're doing in the… the best way you… you know how to. That is, give everything you've got to whatever you're doing. I'm sure you boys all know what I mean. Now, I'm happy to present one of our city's youngest and finest members as our guest chair. He's come all the way from his beautiful long island home, just to be with us. I am proud to present Mr. Cyril Gerrard. Truely, truely punch and duty. All this league will do is duly. Don't you worry, don't you fret. Fast is league will get there yet. Well, look what crawled in from the city dump. -Get out of my way, you little squid. -You're just mean. Order! please. Order! Please. We're on the air. Friends, you're listening to a broadcast of a young American, Onward and Upward League. This is Karen Baxter speaking. Hey, his shirt is ripped. Will the young gentlemen please sit down? Listen, buddy, sit down. Trying to start a riot? Just like your old man. Play! Play the poor and the peasant. -Shall we swing it or just straight? -Play it anyway. One, two. Not you. Mr. Gerrard, you can't go. -Why? -Well, you're the guest chairman. If that gang isn't suitable for your club, then your club's too good for me. You sure smeared back your good deed for the month. You can't lose control like that. That's for dumb guys. I was doing all right. -What are you talking, lefty or something? -Give the pack at me here. Don't get me wrong. I like you. I wouldn't be out here. You and I could go places. Places I go you can't get that fat head of yours through Move over, dude. This pile's big enough. Don't be misled by the scenery. I'm the right guy. Yeah. Certainly. Now then, fellas, how about a feed on me? -What's your say, Pig? -He asked me what do I say. What do we say? What a car! Get a load of this tire, two and three dollars a shot. -Cool vape. -Two slugs, 50. Never mind that guys, all I do is sign the check. Bring us the wine. Come on, you slug. Get busy before we nonchalantly slug you. -Hey like this, poison. -You're trying to knock us off, huh? -You're ignorant. -I mean, so much of poison. -What's the way to call that? -Pull it and cast a role grand-mere. -Can you eat it? -Gee, it's chicken. -Oh, hi, Mom. -Where you kids've been? -We've been out in society. -How do you like a scenery, Mrs. Boylan? -We've been places. -Johnny, whose car was that? Oh, some guy's we met. He's a big shot. Did he give us a swell speed? Hey, fellas, the sheets are coming. Here they are. -See you later. -Johnny, where to? Mum, last edition is up. I made it down my half today. -Go on. -Swing, you give me the papers. -Give me mine. -There's a lot of it. Come on, don't play too many jokes. Yeah, I got a lot today. I haven't got even enough. The rest are mine. Japs surround the Chinese. Yesterday the Chinese surround the Jap. Johnny, give us a headline, will you? Okay, let's see. Here, wealthy man missing. -No, we used that last Saturday. -Yeah, but this is a new guy. All right. Oh, actors attempt suicide. No. Here's your headline, fellas, innocent man goes to the chair. Innocent man goes to chair. That's a good one. Paper. Innocent man goes to chair. Paper. Innocent man goes to chair. Paper. Innocent man goes to chair. Innocent man goes to chair. -Judge Knot. -Yes. I remind you of your lunch appointment in 15 minutes. Yes. Thank you, Winters. Anyone waiting? The Boylan boy. I can't see him now. No more appointments today, please. Yes, sir. I was here yesterday and three hours today. A dozen people got in as I was waiting. He got to see me. I'm sorry, those other people had appointments. Why don't you come back tomorrow about 3:15? Sure. Suppose I come back next Christmas. I got to see him now, I tell you. That was the corporate selection. Judge Knot, I've waited to see you. Sorry, son. Some other time. I'm on my way out now. But I'm Johnny Boylan. You're sentencing my dad to die and he's innocent. The jury, not I, decides a man's innocence or guilt. -I'm sorry, my boy. -But you can give him a new trial. If the case earns a new trial your lawyer will bring the matter before the court in new order. I can't discuss this with you. But you're railroading him. That's what you're doing. Railroading him! Stop him! Stop that boy! Stop that boy! Let me go! He threw a rock. Tried all day to get him to listen to me. Let me explain. He said he couldn't do anything. He said it was up to the governor. It's true, Johnny. There's nothing he can do. Nobody can do anything except sit and wait and look at the clock and let it happen. When it's over, forget about him. Well, I won't. I'm going to get even. That kind of talk isn't going to help. No. It's better than taking it laying down, and I'm not going to see it. Kay, what do you think they're going to do to me? I don't know, Johnny. They can't put anything on me. I've never been in trouble before. Anybody's liable to bust a window. You know that. But you had to pick a window with a judge's head behind. What you are doing here? We just thought we'd drop by to see Johnny. The less you see him the better I like it. We'll never do that to Johnny. -What do you mean? -We came to see him. -No, he's our pal. -We feel sorry for him for he's in crisis. Yeah, I know. All I ask of you is to go on being sorry and stay away from him. That's a fine thing to walk out on a guy when he's down. -Yeah, and it clutches at a law. -Yeah. It's just like a girl. Come on. Well, we come to visit our brother. What's your brother's name? -Well… -Joe, you dope. Yeah, that's right. You see, I'm nervous. I never been to a joint like this before. -Joe what? -Pudlowski. There's no boy by that name here, son. -What? -He's got to be here. He ain't nowhere else. I'm telling you, there's no Joe what you call him here. -I bet it's a plot to hold him solo. -Maybe give him a military degree. They kill me poor little brother. Give me police unit or the morge. What are you kids up to? What are we up to, he asked. What did you do with your pull-ups? What did you do with that? -They killed my brother. -Hey, what is this? Yes, you can't do that to us. Where is he? So what are we up to, he asked. Ain't going home to my ma till I see my brother alive. -I will bust this place wide open. -Let's give him the real us. Guard! Guard! Hey buddy, it's Dopey. Come on, hurry up. Get that rope up here. Come on, get it up. You and Dopey go. High Pocket is in the car. -Okay. -Let's go. Joe, my big brother. Get out of here! Get out of here before we lock y'all up. Excuse us, please. Boy, this is something, riding a cushion. Let's head for a wide open spaces. Quiet, Dopey. Johnny, only a real pal can do this for you. Yeah, I know. So as well you guys the butter. Forget them. I wasn't letting any pal of mine go to reformatory for five or six years when all he needed was little brain oil. If I do the thinking you'll stay out of danger. Listen, big shot, get this straight! I can think of more things in five minutes than you can in a lifetime. See? Hello, Kay. You've been waiting long? Oh, about 20 minutes. I was beginning to think you weren't coming. I'm sorry. I don't know what's on your mind. It's about Johnny. He's in trouble. I guess that much. I didn't suppose that you called me to talk about us. I guess I had a nerve calling you. Suppose we just forget it? I didn't mean it that way. Come on. Sit down and tell me what happened to Johnny. He threw a rock at Judge Knot. They've been holding the juvenile hall just to throw a scare into him. This afternoon, he ran away. Well, I wouldn't let that upset me. He's not the first kid to run away. Let's have a sandwich, then we go out to look for your public foe number one. I couldn't eat anything. Really? Nonsense, we have to eat something. -You'll get ill. -Honest, I couldn't. Now look, will you quit worrying about that kid? He'll be all right. Kay, this is the first time I've had a chance to really talk to you. Please, Paul, some other time. All right. Come on It's not that I don't want to talk to you, Paul. It's just that I don't want Johnny to be alone. Kay, suppose you go home and stay with your mother, I'll go and look for Johnny. I'll never be able to make it up to you. That's all right. We're old friends, aren't we? Thanks, Paul. I tell you it was evil working. I walked to the guy and says I want to see my brother, but I ain't got no brother. I'm acting kind of crazy. Like I'm somebody else. Then I feel getting bigger and bigger and bigger until I fill the whole room with me present, see? Then I let someone have it. Someone that crosses me, see? The rest I forget. You know something, mister? Those guys weren't polite. No consideration at all. After seeing the condition you left that office in, I'd say it was a toss-up between you and Mrs. O'Leary's cow. Run along now and don't forget what I told you if you see Johnny. Mister, I still think if you look closets in the detention you'd find Johnny's body. Oh, keep quiet. So long, Kay. -Goodnight, Mrs. Boylan. -Goodnight. -Has he arrived? -No, not yet. Oh, this is Mr. Morgan, a probation officer. How are you? I've looked in all the Turkish bars. I've crept the waterfront in case he decided to go about there. I wouldn't worry too much, kids are all alike, after a while, they get hungry and come home. I wish you leave this to me. I vow to give him a good scolding, I'll even make him write a nice letter of apology. After all, a mother knows what's best for her child. Well, if you hear anything, Miss Boylan, just get in touch with us. Thanks for being so kind. Good night. Hunting my boy like a common criminal. Thanks for the smile. Paul, do you remember that night at the theater? Yes. I didn't go with Dot and those fellas. Go ahead and kiss her. Johnny! Oh, my God. It's all right, Ma. Here's a nickel. Go ahead and phone the cops. We won't have to phone the cops, I'll go with you and we resolve all. We will not pig's eye. We did fine without you. Stay out of this! Johnny, what are you talking about? You told that cop you'd turn me in. That's exactly what I'll do before you get in more trouble. Go on and call, the phone's right outside. If you do, you won't ever see me, because I won't be here when they come. You're talking crazy. Think of what you're doing to us. I'm thinking about myself. It's me they want to put away. If you surrender, they'll be easy on you. Put you on probation. Yeah, with my family record. My old man in the death house. It's just a boy, let's go out. I'm going to a pile it down. Sure, I'm be going to sent for probation. Maybe they will send you up for a few months, but lots of things are worse than that. I never ran away or blamed your Mom for what I had to face. I know all about that. I know he'd have married you long ago if it hadn't been for me and Mom. Gosh, I ain't a kid anymore. I can see what's happening to you. Things haven't panned out the way we figured that night on the roof. They got Dad, we're still down here. We'll remain here till we're dead if we don't do something. I'm getting out now. Right now! Oh, stop it! Johnny, come back! -What are going to do? -Don't worry I'll do all right. Hey, guys, get a load of this joint. Looks like a museum. Come in, boys. "What do you think I am?" I said. "Nice," I said. I breaks him up, see? Put him on the defensive. Then he says, "I ain't giving up." Then he says, "Okay, if you see Johnny, send him home." I say, "Sure, I will. Sure." Very amusing. Boy, this beats Coney Island. Hey, this is a swell setup. I'm going to tell my old lady about it. You get your shirt washed, you can take a bath at the same time. Watch me go. The crowd roars. This grinder's killing me. This bike racing is too much, you can't let the public down, Pig. Come on, you foot, just swab. Forward for dear old lady. Here comes Cicero and it's Cicero. Hear him roar, hear him roar, at a little woman. You got to do it for the little woman and Achilles. You got to win. You got to win. You got to win. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Fellas, we might just get down to business. Better wait for Johnny, he might assume wrongly. I rather doubt if Johnny's coming. We're in by all of it. You mean? He can't let the gang down after what we done for him. Now he's clearly in the hands of the law. Not only a traitor to our trust, but a rat as well. Save the riddles, High Pockets. What's happened? I left him at the Turkish bar this afternoon with definite instructions. He wanted to stay with his old lady. This old man's going to get it tonight. I tried to argue him out, but you know him. Exactly. He probably walked right into a police trap. Well, I did what I could for him. Hey, if anything happens to Johnny, we call the whole show off, see? That's entirely up to you boys, I have nothing to gain. What do you mean you not gaining? You take us for bunch of dogs? I put it this way, I'm not interested in any financial prizes that result from our activities. I don't want any. You don't want a cut? -You see, boys, I'm bored with my life. -Oh, I'm so bored with my life. I envy you. I envy your disorganized lives. I want to take you to party and see what makes you tick. Tick tock, tick tock. It's dynamite. Just admit you're barmy and go on from there. Am trying to tell you I'm done being rigid. I want a thrill of life. A little danger. I want to be as clever as… as you. -How do you suppose that got there? -You're doing all right, pal. With me, you'll do even better. Look, I'm prepared to give you an advance against our future success. Now we'll drink to that in champagne. -Champagne? -What's that? That bubbly stuff? Sure. Soda pop with a kick. How about all stooges downstairs? If one of them hear you talking this way… The servants? Don't worry about them. No one intrudes on my privacy. This is my sanctum sanctorum. Do you hear that? This is his private sanatorium. He is nuts. -Oh, Johnny. -All right, Johnny. That'll be all, Robert. I didn't expect to see you again. You didn't? Here I am. We're having a meeting. I'll be right back. Hello, Johnny, where've you been? -How's your folks, Johnny? -We're awful sorry. Yeah, you know, about your old man. You know Cyril? He's ready for the booby hatch. Wasting that. If he shuts his mouth, he comes out of his ears. That's right fellas? Sure. Here it is. We will now drink a toast to fidelity. As your leader, I demand a pledge. He told mommy he wanted to die at night. Well, I sold all the junk. There you're, Johnny. You all get ten bucks. Is that all we get? I can do better when selling newspapers. Never knew they sold newspapers in reform school. Quit the wisecracks. Come on. Come on. Come across a mike. How about the girl? That's it. You guys shirk the protection you're getting from being with me. Like, I'm an alibi if one wants to know where you're getting your spending money. True, Johnny. -Hiya, boys. -Who let you out? Who are you and what do you want, liver lips? I've been called a lot of things in my time. How about kicking in with some of that rent? What rent? I thought you told me your old man owned this joint. Well, he used to. I just found out yesterday he sold it. A triple cross, huh? -Well, how much? -Well, now, let me see. I want to play ball with you boys. Suppose we make it $60 and they keep my mouth shut. Okay. Come on, boys. Let's do this. Come on. Give me yours. Come on. There. You ought to get yourself a job as a mind reader in a flea circus. The guy kills me. You boys string along with old Domino, and nobody will know from nothing. Yeah, sure, sure. Come on, get going, gang. Come on. I said get going! I suppose we won't be seeing you till next month? That's right, sonny. -Why you little? -Spit on it, pal! Police linked series of recent thefts to a well-organized gang. Losses running into thousands. Losses running into thousands. I got out of it so far with two cheap ties, a secondhand suit, and shoes that don't fit. I'm will get the jitters every time I open a door. Slow down, High Pockets, there's a police car trailing us. -They want to play tag. Shall we play? -Forget the speeches. This car happens to be one of the things your old man don't own. Why don't you turn yourself in? Others can use your cut. Can't they, Pig? I didn't hear none and I don't to hear. Give me at back here. That's right up you. Get everybody out. You keep yapping and I'll drop you in the river. Quiet, I want to sleep. Oh, hello, Mom. Do you know who this is? Yeah, it's Johnny. That's right. Are you all right, Johnny? You sound like you've got a cold. Yeah. How's that? I guess my voice is changing, you know, sort of grown up. How do you like that new telephone I got in for you? Well, you do? Well, that's swell. -Ma, are you all right? -I'm all right. Why don't you come home, Johnny? Well, I'm coming home pretty soon, honest. Ma, is Kay sore at me? Nobody's sore, Johnny. We're just afraid for you. Oh, forget it. I'm doing all right. No kidding, Ma, how is Kay? She's all right I guess. She and Paul will be getting married. Don't you mind anything because I'm still going to be taking care of you. If I could just hear you coming into the house like you used to, banging the door, never scared of anything. -Go, I'm talking to Ma. -Cut it short, will you? Stomach feels like it'd spray with ice water. Hello, Ma. Oh, that's just some guy. Well, look, I got to hang up now. Yeah, don't you worry about anything. The bulls. Scram, I'll cover you. High Pockets and Pig are waiting for you in the car. Johnny. Hello? Hello? Did you see the boy who just use that phone? No, I didn't. Did you see him? Did you see the kid that just used that phone? Well, answer me. Did you see him or not? So long flat foot. So long. I warned you that phone idea was trouble? Yeah. Gee, Ma sounded awful old. Hey, look out where you're going, will you? Come on. Come on. Step on it. I don't want to go up for no stoplight. Don't worry, you won't. Cut out the wisecracking or I'll push your face in. Now get out, the two of you. We're washed up. Go on home and play ping-pong with yourself. We'll do all right without him. I got ideas of my own. Let's run over him. Give him hit-and-run. Oh, what for? Sit down, son, I want to get this right. You masqueraded. I prefer standing if you don't mind. It eases my thinking. Just a peculiarity of mine. That's quite all right. You became the leader of this gang to gain their trust so that you trap them? Precisely. You see, I've made an extensive study of criminology, and I felt here would be an ideal chance to get experience and simultaneously be of benefit to the officers. I see. You were putting your theories to the test. Precisely. Sit down, young man! Yes, sir. -When is the show starting? -In five minutes. Well, give me two louces, please. There they are. I told you. Two, please. My man, it's a book! Get away from me! Two of them got away. You should have brought more men. Dirty squealer. A yellow spank. This has been very amusing. I'd like to keep working out of your office on unique missions, undercover work. You'll be covert until you're 21. Put him in with the rest. -That isn't playing square. -Get on that car. Before my arrest, I'd like to clarify who my father is. You introduced him to me. He's down at the station waiting for us. Ow. Boy. I come back and give myself up just to get a crack at that guy, Cyril. -There ain't no fun hitting that guy. -We're going to blow town. -How about Chicago? -No, we're going way out west. First, we got to get some of this I stole to Ma. Let's stay over here a couple of hours till the heat's off. You are a wise, I thought you got company. Take out a phone, tell her what to say, she do it and leave. But she tells me because she's got to see you. Skip it. How are you, Rita Belle? Who did you talk to, Ma or Kay? Your sister. She's coming. She wants you to wait for her. I'm glad to see you again. Huh, tied up for that. Say we're gone, because the cops will be dabbing like woodpeckers. When we ain't listening, she goes and tells everything, just like a girl. You keep that big trap shut. Rita, I'm in a little trouble. Not serious. Give that to Kay. Tell her I'm sorry it isn't more. Will do it like a good girl? Yes, but can't you wait just a little while longer? -She want to see you badly. -I'd like to. Honest, I'd, but I got to keep moving. You tell her that, she'll get it. -Rita Belle? -Yes. You didn't see me, if anyone asks you. Got that? -All right, Johnny. -That's a good little girl. Here, buy yourself something. Come on. -Hey, son. -Yes. You forgot to pay me. All right, sir. I think it's nothing new. Here. -Your friend is in a big hurry, huh? -He's always that way. Good night, Pop. Good night. Call again, please. -Do you see that way? -Yeah. That's where I was born. You see that spot? That's where we'll die if we don't hurry. Shut up. Shut up! Johnny, it's the bull. There, go on the stairway. Looks like they got us. Forget. I ain't giving up. Come. -Stand where you are! -Stop it! The door to the alley! There isn't. Get down and stay down! I said get down and stay down! -What are you doing? -Let's keep quiet! Get down your dummy head. Stop here, miss. All right, stand back! Get back there! Stand back! Keep that crowd back. Rope off the street! Okay, Sergeant. Send for an ambulance and stand by. -Johnny. -What? What are they waiting for? I don't know. Let me go straight home to my wife. I want to be with my wife today. Do not push, it's two police. They don't mean any harm. What's that? -That's just an ambulance. -I guess that's what they're waiting for. Get back on the road! Get back! Let no one fire unless I give the orders. Keep back! -On the roof, I'm hitting him. -You're imagining. -I saw something moving. -We ain't wasting shots on shadows. Let me get home, I want to be safe with my wife. She might be worried about me. -You, shut up! -Are you blowing your top? I can't hear nothing with that guy shooting off his mouth the way he does. Boylan, throw your guns in the street and come out with your hands in the air! One at a time! You shouldn't let him go, now they'll really blast us. You said his squat's getting on you, didn't you? I couldn't stand it either. I'll give you just one minute to come out or be blown out. -You hear what he said? -Yeah. But I don't trust him. Once they get us out, they'll shoot us. -Not if we go out surrendered they won't. -Ain't give me up. If they can railroad my pop to the chair for doing nothing, what do you think they'll do to us? I ain't staying. I'll give myself up. If you do, I'll plug you full of holes before you open that door. You kill me, you'll end up like your old man. You no good. Think. Johnny, don't. I didn't mean it. You know I didn't. I'd do anything you say. Only don't shoot. Johnny, let me go! All right. Go on, beat it! Quick before I change my mind! Let them have it. Hold the fire, boy. Sergeant, this is Boylan's sister. You'd still be living if you listened to me, Pig. I knew they'd crush you. It's all I know. Keep away from me, you squealer. Hear me? I said keep away! This gun will go off. Go ahead and shoot. It's better you kill me than someone out. I warned you, Kay! Johnny, drop that gun! Johnny, drop that gun! Johnny. Therefore, it is my duty to sentence you on this date to the Grand School for boys until you are 21. This school has a merit system which will enable those who take edge of it to be ready for parole at the end of 18 months. Are there any questions? Your Honor, I feel in a measure responsible for this whole misfortune. If you release my son and all these boys to me, I'd send them to a good military school. I believe we'd accomplish more. Mr. Gerrard, these boys have destroyed property and endangered lives. They must be punished, not rewarded. I think the Grand will help your boy, all these boys. It's not a prison with barbed wire fences and Blacksnake whips, it's a school for first offenders. Of course, the results. depend on cooperation from the boys. If you want to help, put out your hand when they come home, they'll need friends then too. Hold on, boys. Take it easy or I'll spend the next 18 months here. Can you take a chill? Come on. Carl Adams was killed and Johnny Boylan is the boy who was with him. I see. Johnny Boylan, please stand. Come here, Johnny. Johnny, you've got yourself into trouble in the last few months, haven't you? -Yes, sir. -You had a reason for that? Or were you just out for adventure? I had a reason. -A good reason. -What was it? Money to get mom and Kay a decent place to live in. You had to steal to do that? Yes, sir. You started out to steal and even murder if necessary so that you could give money to your mother and sister? I didn't say none about murder. But for your sister, you would be a murderer today. I think you'll admit that, Mrs. Boylan? Yes. How much money did your son give you after he left home? I don't remember exactly. He's always been a good boy. When he sold newspapers, he gave me every cent. You're still living at the same address? Oh, yes. That'll be all, Mrs. Boylan. Johnny, do you know what a criminal's doing when he says, "I stole for my mother", "I lied to protect my pal"? He's just making his mother and his pal take over his guilt. -He's being soft. -I ain't asking you to be easy with me. Go ahead and send me up and get it over with. Is Rita Belle Warren in the courtroom? Come here, Rita Belle. I see by this report that you've known Johnny for a long time. Tell me something about him. Well, we went to the same school and he lived next to me. That was before he moved away? Yes, sir. Speak louder, Rita Belle. Did you ever see each other after that? What do you want to know that for? You keep your all out of this, Johnny. Yes, sir, I did. What did you talk about? He didn't have much to say, and he didn't give me a chance to say anything. He was in sort of a hurry. Did he give you anything? -I… -I gave her a package for Mom. She didn't know what it was. Now, Johnny, I'm not going to warn you again about talking out of turn. Go on, Rita Belle. Well, the time I was thinking of is, when he bought me an ice cream cone, a maple pecan one. Thank you, Rita Belle. That's all. Do you remember that, Johnny? You're making a monkey out of me? -Answer my question. -Sure. Sure, I remember. I'm glad to hear that. Now, you said something about a package, did you see each other again? I was thinking about something else. -Johnny, what am I going to do with you? -Send me away and forget it. Yes, I could do that. I could send you to Grand School until you're 21 and then to prison for ten years. Your Honor, may I? If the court pleases, this is Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson, what is your relationship to this family? Miss Boylan and I are getting married, Your Honor. I'm sure we could take good care of Johnny. I see. Miss Boylan, the court is fully aware of the efforts you've made on behalf of your brother and the great trouble he's caused you. There isn't anything we won't do to help him, Your Honor. Johnny isn't really tough. We all had a bad time of it when my father left us. I understand. Please be seated. Johnny, of all the boys in this case, you have the most to come back to. If you only want to. I could remember that you carried a gun, resisted arrest and an officer was wounded and that your pal was killed. Yes, sir. But I don't want to do that because I believe the boy that Rita Belle and your family believe in is coming back, if you give him a break. Do you want to give him that break, Johnny? Yes, Your Honor. Then I'm sending you to Grand School along with the other boys. Goodbye and good luck. It's all right, Johnny. Mama. -Goodbye, Johnny. -So long, Paul. -Hello, Johnny. -Hi, Ma. Do you like it? Not bad? All men in my family look good in uniforms. -Hi, Rita. -Hello. -Hiya, fella. -Hi, Paul. It's great seeing you. -Thanks for that spending money, Paul. -Okay, pal. You were swell, Johnny. -How are you Mrs. Boylan? -Hello. -Could you see me? -You were the busiest guy. What's happened to Cyril's eye? It's been that since we've been up here. It's a deal. Every time he goes about his old man's dough, we get to sock him. -It was his own idea. Honest. -Oh, it was, wasn't it? He's never been regular yet. -I hope. -I hope, I hope, I hope. Why do you want to do that for? Because…
