(melancholic music) - Goodbye, Buffalo. I guess the powers that be ruled us out. I'll just say goodnight to our listeners as we sign off for the last time. It was really great talking with you. Stay warm under the covers. Have a pleasant night. - Good show, Kiddo. Larry says, good luck, we'll miss you. He would have told you himself, but he, I'm lying, he didn't. It's from me. How's it been? You sleeping? Still looking at everyone like you're Norman Bates? (sighs) I left a couple of things at your place. I can, I can pick 'em up later. I guess this is it. I think it's best. Don't you? If you could just say one thing. (melancholic music) - Still feeling sorry for yourself, David? - You never leave me alone. - I wish I could, but you keep thinkin' of me, even if you say you don't want to. That's what sisters do, we gnaw on your brains. Aw, why is it that every time you think of me, I'm wearing this same, dorky, '70s, white vinyl snow jacket? I haven't worn this since I was 14. I feel like a blimp. You couldn't imagine me dead in a better outfit? - It's just the way I'll always remember you, Katie You look fine. Beautiful. You look like you. - Thank you. I think. I know the reason why, though. It doesn't matter. I'm dead anyway. Who am I going to impress? How are Mom and Dad? - Dad has started building birdhouses since you left, one for every post on the fence in the back yard. That's all you hear is the hammering whenever I stop over. - Hmm, they'll get over it. - What does that mean? - Never mind, sorry. - What did you mean by that? - I said I was sorry. - I just need time to get things together. - You're 36 years old! - That's not old. - I know, but I'm a lot older than you, - Only three years-- - Three and 3/4! Besides, anything close to 40 may be too late. I only say that because when I was 36, I still didn't know my ear from my elbow, but you, there are better designs. You already achieved some of them, remember? - What am I suppose to do now? - You know. - I need you to help me. - I can't any more, David, I'm dead. And no matter what you think, I'm not coming back again. (music) - [Bob] You're listening to Inspiration in the Evening with your host, family and youth counselor, June Handly. Brought to you live from Gainesville, Florida. - Thank you, Bob. Well, I have got some sad and frankly alarming news In a recent ruling, a Miami judge declared, any attempt to deny children a home headed by same-sex partners should be ruled unconstitutional. Yeah, my concern, Bob, is only for the children. That's all I care about. And come on, come on These kids are gonna be raised without the complimentary male, female influence, saturated in a lifestyle. They just don't have the best chance. And, look, I don't mean to be hateful. I know people will say it anyway, but look, I have always been compassionate about those less fortunate than to have the normal, full lives of family and heritage that come with being heterosexual. And it hurts my heart, and I know it hurts God's heart. So, that's why I encourage you, if you know someone who is on this path or if you, yourself are lost in this lifestyle and especially those in our youth ministry, remember, God can grant you the strength to make you straight or at least completely celibate. Now, I know a lot of you have questions, and we wanna hear from you. The number to call is 277-2700, and, okay, we have David in Buffalo, New York. - Hey, June, this is Danger Dave Patrone from my radio show, Gay Talk. - Who? - I'm the host of a local, community radio show called Gay Talk. We have an open discussion and debate of local gay news, topics, entertainment, mostly fluffy stuff for everyone here in western New York. In fact, we're talking live on the air on my show and I'm on yours! - Clever. Could we get to the point, David? - Well, I caught your show yesterday and I was wondering if you'd be willing to answer a few minor questions. just for clarification? - [June] Sure, what is it you'd like to know? - Well, yesterday on your show, you told a gay teenager to seek reparative therapy. - Yes, now for listeners who don't know, that's conversion of sexual orientation. - Just wondering, is the kind of therapy you recommend endorsed by the American Psychological Association? - Well, up to 25 to 50% of patients report significant improvements. - But is it a fact patients who undergo this kind of therapy must sign a waiver before they're treated because the significant improvements are actually clinically unproven? - Well, you know, there is some margin of error in all types of therapy. - Did you choose to be straight? - What? - Let's say, just for arguments sake, someone, a group, was trying to convince you you should have an undeniable attraction to Pamela Anderson. - Excuse me! - Let's say you could change your behavior to lust for Pamela, even change your thinking, but that wouldn't change your real desires for David Hasselhoff. You become depressed, mentally unstable, even suicidal because you know deep down you don't have the hots for Pam and on the inside you're about as gay as Donna Reed. - [June] With everything there's struggle, David. People who want change in their life have a right to seek it. - But with young people it's very important to give them the facts. - I agree, and that's why-- - So you agree we should give them the facts? - In the Bible, David, if you'll let me talk, it clearly states, no man is to lie with another man. - Very good, that is a fact, I'm glad you brought it up because I just so happen to have a handy dandy Bible. Mind if I quote some other passages? - Actually, I'd like to move on to my next caller. - Leviticus, part of the Holiness Code also includes rules for burning bulls, sheep, goats, doves, pigeons. Burn any bulls today, June? Anyone who finds mildew in his house must go and tell the priest about it. Hey, God, can't we just use bleach? - I suppose now you'll telling me that Jesus never spoke against homosexuality. - Well, there are parts of the Bible that potentially affirm gay relationships. Look here, we got Ruth and Naomi and oh, David and Jonathan. - You show me where. - The soul of Jonathan was bound to the soul of David. Jonathan loved him as his own soul. - Scripture twisting. - Jonathan made David swear again-- - Look, my listeners do not have to be subjected-- by his love for him for he loved him as he loved his own life. Your love for me was more wonderful than that of women. They kissed each other and wept with each other. - Strictly interpretive. - They do kiss. Look, there are gay Christians-- - Not true Christians. - Who could probably argue this better than I could. - Great, thank you, David. - I just think instead of potentially harming gay kids, who, believe me, have enough grief in their lives-- it might be more helpful and cost effective if fundamentalist therapists sought therapy themselves in order to resolve their heterosexist reproductive superiority issues. - And we'll be back-- - And before you suggest that - With more hopeful listeners after this. - Gays are lacking in family and heritage, check out the facts. June? June? Sorry, I went on like that, folks, but that makes me wanna puke. (mimics vomiting) (laughing) Cactus Kickers, Buffalo's own gay country western dancing club, will meet Wednesday, Buddies Bar, seven p.m. Latecomers will be lassoed and branded. (hisses) Well, unfortunately, we're out of time here on Gay Talk. Please join us tomorrow for our ongoing discussion of body piercing, fashion or faux-pas? Be sure to call in with your questions or comments. We'd love to hear from you. This is Danger Dave Patrone. Thank you and have a good gay night!

Please, it's fine. - No. Really, really good, what you did on your show tonight. I really liked it. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah, you had her running scared. - I, uh, I, um, don't usually do stuff like that. - I know, it was a good surprise. (laughing) - She gives me a rash. - Oh yeah. - A great, big, pimply, hairy, butt rash! - Wow. - Oh. Um, I'm sorry. I forgot your name. - I'm Chris, your new technical assistant for the next few months. Tonight's my first night. Mark is on vacation in Florida. - Oh, oh, God! Yeah, I'm so sorry. I must have not been paying attention. - No, it's okay. When I came in you were so intense, working on your facts probably. I figured that I'd introduce myself until later. I'm a really big fan. I mean, it's about time this town had its own gay radio show. You remind people around here that we exist. Buffalo Pride, yeah. - Well, I know how hard it can be when you're a little different. - No, to me you're like Mr. Super Gay here. I bet you're a star down at Buddies. - Uh, they don't know who I am. - No, you're brave to make this happen right here in little ol' Buffalo. - Brave is a pretty strong word. - I don't think so. I mean you could be working at the Radio Outlet. - Is that where you work? - I manage the one in the Boulevard Mall. In my spare time I fill in on drums for an all-lesbian rock band. They call themselves Butch and the Cassidys. I think they're still working on the name. I'm not an official member, just until they find another lesbian, I guess. - That sounds fun. - Yeah. You don't remember me, do you? - What? - We met once before, a few years ago. - God, it's colder than a witch's titty out there! Oh, I'm sorry. I hope I'm not disturbing. - Katie, what are you doing here so late? - I know, I'm sorry. I had to speak to you about something. You know me, always in a hurry. (nervously chuckles) - Chris, this is my sister, Kate. Chris is our new technical assistant. - Nice to meet you. You look familiar -- - We met before at your wedding, I'm not related. I was just there for other reasons, and you-- - Oh, of course, I remember, yes. How funny-- - Um, your brother was brilliant on his show tonight. - No. - I know, but David, I couldn't hear the whole thing this time. I don't know, my car radio conked out on the way down here. It's been like that for a while. Mom and Dad will tell me about it. They listen to it and record it every night. We are so proud of him. Our gay son, they say, my gay brother. (laughing) You know, by the time he told them, they already knew. He's a bit of a slow starter that way, ow. - Well, I better be going. I gotta scrape the ice off my windshield. - Oh, you can borrow David's. - [David] My what? - Your scraper. You always keep a spare one in the car. He's always prepared. I can wait. - [Chris] That's okay, I have one. - Oh. - Of course he has one, everyone has one. - Well, I just thought maybe you could help each other with the scraping. - Well thank you, I'm fine. It was ice meeting you again. I'll see you same time tomorrow. - Right. (gentle music) (indistinct chattering) - Same time. - Yes! - Right, same time. - Great to meet you again. - Oh, thanks. (Kate laughs) Bye. - Drive safe! - Bye - Goodnight. - Bye, goodnight. - Is he single? - [David] I don't know. - [Kate] You didn't ask? - [David] No. - Why not? - I almost didn't notice he was even here, and I'm not sure if he's gay. - Are you blind, deaf, and stupid? Of course he's gay and he's got a thing for you. I could tell that when I first met him four years ago. - Why did you do that, embarrass me like that? - That was four years ago, David. I did it because you need someone to give you a little boost. Otherwise, you sit in your corner and you cry. Boohoo, my name is David Patrone, and I don't have a boyfriend, boohoo. You're a full-time library assistant, that's all you'd be if I didn't push you to do this show. - Oh yes, you made me, you created me. Anything else I need to give you credit for? - No, I just don't see what you're afraid of. You place a personal ad and you don't answer any of your responses. You hide behind your work. I don't want you to be alone. - Like you? - I'm different, I couldn't pick 'em, I gave marriage a fair try three times. You, you've never had a steady boyfriend in your life . - Oh come on, what about-- - And that toy collector who lived in a trailer home in East Aurora who you dated for three months does not count. - I'm not meeting the right people. My dating options are limited here. - Hello, look what just walked out the door. - Give it a rest, I don't know anything about him. - You know enough to make the first move for once in your life. Put it away. David. What surprises me is how bold you can be when you're on the air. - That's different! - Why? - Just, because. - Because why? - Because when I'm on the air, I have to be different person, not just me any more. Someone might be listening. That makes it important. - I just think you should think about yourself more often. God, I hate you, David! ("I Will Carry You" By Marc Jackson plays) Go ahead, say it, I'm a bossy, shrewy witch.

I've decided to adopt. - What? - I'm 39 years old, nobody wants these eggs any more. Besides, I'm sick of men controlling my life, pretending to be some kind of knight in shining armor saving me from utter doom. I'm ready to take on something of my own and I don't need a husband to do it. - How feminist of you. - I'm adopting because I'm ready. I have a lot of love to give and I'm tired of waiting for it. - Have you really thought about this? This is a lot harder than raising cats. You have to pay for college, give up having a sex life. - I've thought about all that. - I'm not saying you can't, I'm just checking to make sure this isn't another passing idea of yours like rollerblading or opening a Buddhist greeting card shop. - I've never been so sure of anything else in my life. Can you help me? - With what? - You know, if I need help raising him or her, whatever we decide. - Of course I will. Don't you need to think this through? - I'm already halfway through the process. I went through an agency in Syracuse. They told me I passed the home study yesterday, I even completed the INS forms. - INS? - I'm doing an international adoption. There are thousands of couples who want babies here. They get preference, singles are at the bottom of the list. Look, Central America, Brazil, these kids have less of a chance. The responsibility is all mine, you don't have to do anything you don't want. I'm just saying just in case he, she needs a father, you'll pitch in, won't you? - This is so sudden. Why does the word father give me the heebiejeebies? - You love kids. You always said you thought about having a kid of your own. This'll be like a trial run. - I thought about it, I don't know if I'm ready yet. - When is ready for you? You waited until you were 30 before you told Mom and Dad you were gay. And by that time, you were already passing out condoms on the streets of Buffalo. Besides, it'll really just be mine, I just need you to help me. - With Mom and Dad. - Defend me against them, they already think I'm a hopeless flake. They'll trust you if you think it's a good idea, somehow you're in on it with me. - You can do whatever you want Katie, you're almost 40. - Don't say the F word! And you know that isn't true. Yeah I can do whatever I want, but then they'll curse me for the rest of my life with the Sicilian evil eye. The last time I went to Dad with news was right after I had my first divorce. - Now, don't start that-- - You know what he said? - Yes! - He looked me right in the eye and he said, - [David And Kate] You'll go to hell. - I will never forget the sound of his voice. - He didn't mean it, ya know it! They got older and wiser. - No, they just lost the ability to fight back. I never bothered telling him about the other two divorces after that. - I think he figured it out. - It was completely different for you, even when you told them you were gay, it was like nothing. - Oh, now you're exaggerating! - I was the guinea pig. By the time they got to you, they just pooped out. - They love you too Katie, they always ask about you. They're afraid to talk to you. You burst into flames the moment they say the wrong thing. Look, maybe you should think about this some more. - It's too late, I'm already committed. - What if the child were sick? I read about a couple that adopted a baby girl in China. They didn't find out she had Hepatitis B until they got back to the States. They don't even run those kinds of tests there. - It's a chance I'll have to take. Are you in this with me or not? - Maybe you could go to a sperm bank, I just think you should consider all your options. - Oh, you are just like Mom and Dad, always questioning me. I thought I could count on you. - Did you ever think maybe you're doing all this just to get back at Mom and Dad? - What? This whole adoption process isn't easy, David. If I was really doing this for selfish reasons, I could just replicate these fabulous genes by having a one night stand with some idiot dweeb at the bank. I'm going through with this, whether you're behind me or not. - Katie. ("Of Strange Lands and People") Katie! (answering machine beeps) - [Mom] It's Mom, uh, I forgot why I called. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. (cat meows) (door creaks) (clapping) - I can never get it right. - It sounds great, you're my Clara Wieck Schumann. - You always say that. You were always the nice one. - But I hate your cat. - You've gotta stop expecting her to act like a dog, David. - I'm better with dogs. - I know. I thought about what you said. - About what? - About Mom and Dad, me wanting to get back at them. - Forget it. - No you're right. I could want this child for all the wrong reasons. - I shouldn't have said that. I think I got a little jealous 'cause I realized it wouldn't always just be you and me paling around. I got used to the fact that all your marriages would be flops and it would always be the two of us. - Thanks. - I'm used to having you there for me, nagging me. I'm not used to sharing. - I told you first because I wanted you to be a part of this so much, you goof. - I just needed time to take it all in. - Are you with me or not, what's the verdict? - Well, some people might find bringing a child from orphan poverty to Buffalo redundant but I think it's a great idea. I like it, a lot. - You do? - I'm gonna be an uncle, someone's fabulous old gay uncle. - [Kate] Uncle David! - We can teach each other how to change diapers, watch nonstop reruns of sing-a-long shows. - I've always wanted this. - Me too. Come on, I'll take you for burritos and a hot fudge sundae. We'll celebrate, Mommy. - Don't use that word, I'm not used to it yet. - I can't wait to buy things in bulk. We can shop for baby booties, diapers, mega-strollers. - We may not need to. Look, they have a child picked out for me already. - Katie, this girl is almost nine years old. - [Kate] Her name is Margaret. She was abandoned by her parents when she was only a baby. Some English nuns working at the orphanage in Brazil named her. She was always quiet, so most potential parents just assumed she was damaged goods. So, an older nun starts teaching her the piano. They notice a change. Margaret smiles once in a while. She starts talking. Turns out the old nun dies and the piano goes out with her. But Margaret keeps practicing the music by herself. Some of the other kids see and start calling her names. - Katie. - But I'm going to change all that. I'm sending her this old piano. - You're shipping a piano to Brazil? - Well, I need to make a donation to the orphanage, this'll be part of it. And I'm sending her sheet music with it tomorrow. She can start practicing right away, or not. Whatever she wants. - Katie, I just don't know if -- - Don't you see this is perfect for me? If I don't adopt her, then who will? Nobody else can understand her better than the two of us. We are the freaks of Buffalo. - I guess we are. - I think that's very generous of you. - I know. - I wish I could be that good. - You are, David. Your work has meaning. This is the first time I've ever done anything like this and I feel it's just the beginning.

He sure is, can you say hello to that man? Look at that. He likes you. (melancholic music) - Hey, Danger Dave. My 10-year-old son, Hector, wears mini skirts and sings at the top of his lungs. Do you think he's gay or just having an identity crisis? (sighs) I don't know. You don't need me to tell you to sit him down and tell him you love him for whatever he is.

So did you. I can't believe you don't remember having met before. At your sister's wedding. - My sister's been divorced three times. - This was maybe four years ago, we danced. - I would remember you if... - It was very brief, kind of awkward situation. I wasn't really a guest there. I happened to be at a convention in the hotel and your sister asked me to dance with you. - Oh, my God! That was you? (chuckling) - I don't usually do stuff like that, but your sister pointed you out and said you were a decent guy, so I thought, sure, why not? - I'm so sorry about that. I think my sister was a little. (laughing) She shouldn't have done that, I'm sorry. - I'm not. I mean, it was fun. - Yeah, it was fun. - You ran off for reasons I perfectly understand.

Gay Talk is about lesbian hockey team scores, Madonna, Madonna. - Larry says it's good for ratings. - The only reason I called in to her show because I didn't want her turning out ex-gay, teenage zombies! - Most people like what you say. - The woman'll be prepared this time. - So will you. - The woman is nuts! - So are you. David, this is important. (David groans) - You ever think about having kids? - Yes. - You do? - Yes. - Really? - Yes. Does that shock you? - No, it's um, just most gay men don't usually think about those things. - Who says? - No one. I'm just saying it's not common, that's all. - Well, obviously you do. And you are gay, aren't you? - Sometimes, I imagine this little face looking right at me. Maybe I need a dog. - Maybe you should get one. - A dog? I can't. I'm a slob. - [Chris] You are a slob. - But what if those people were right? - What do you mean? - What if it were wrong for people like, for people like us to have kids? - You're turning into June Handly? Two of the women in the band have a baby girl. She's happy. - How would you feel if you were the kid? Wouldn't you be like, oh, god. Why do I have to be Heather with two mommies? Everyone calling you names. - I don't know. I think I'd be happy just to have someone. - I have a confession to make. - Mm-hmm? - I did remember you from four years ago. I never forgot. - Me neither. - Of course, it's, it's hard being single and wanting certain things and trying to find other people who want that too, you know? - Yes. - It's very hard. - It is. - Don't you hate everything you have to do in this world just to get a date? - I do. - Bars? - Bars, no. No. - They suck, right? Just totally sucky. (chuckling) - Personals. - They suck. - Yes, they do. Internet dating. - You're on in one. - What have I got? Look, Bondage Man sends me another naked picture of himself and says he wants to cook me dinner. - Definitely not your type. - Well, don't you hate the whole superficial labeling system? Tops, bottoms, bears, - Butch, fem, dyke. - Queen. Hello, people! - Can't we all just get along? - Just let ourselves be people. - That's right, that's right. You're on in five, four. - [Radio Announcer] Gay Talk! ♪ Danger ♪ ♪ Danger Dave ♪ - There's nothing worse than being gay and knowing that you still don't fit in, even with the other gay people. Like, you're at a parade or at a big dance and everyone else is fabulous, hip, and funny, and you're not, but you're one of them, so you should be. Why aren't you? You just stand there 'cause you don't go to the gym every day, can't afford better clothing than GAP. I mean, this is the way I've been my entire life! Uh, this portion of Gay Talk is brought to you by, um, uh, eh, Lake Erie Ice Cream and Buddies Bar and Grill. Buddies is proud to present its third annual Winter Wienie and Tobogganing Festival. Go tobogganing with a buddy and get a free Say-Lean hot dog on a fresh super bread bun. Say-Lean, it's the best tasting wienie in Buffalo Well, uh, I guess we were talkin' about our own demons, right, Chris? - Uh. Right, Dave. - Welcome to the wonderful world of being who you really are. It sucks big time. And most people just want you to shut up about it. It's no wonder we feel the way we do. Believe it or not, it took me a long time to even say the word gay. I told my sister first. Because I was afraid to offend anyone. I didn't wanna ruin anyone's Homecoming or Christmas. We're all messed up because of those little, slight messages we get from the world that we can't run away from. I guess we all deal with it in some way or another. If you're out there and you're listening, you know who you are, and that's what counts the most. I'd like to dedicate this song to you, who is very different. (peaceful music) - What are you doing? - I talk too much. - [Listener] Uh, Danger Dave. I'm new in this city, and I feel like I don't fit in. - [Listener] Hi Danger Dave, I'm a trans woman. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one in this town. - I'm not gay or anything. I just like to wear different colors in my hair and very dark eyeliner, but I get-- - After I came out at my school and everyone found out, I got kicked out of my outdoors club. - Hey, Danger Dave. - My daughter's a lesbian. I tell her-- - I play basketball on my high school team.

If they see I'm busy maybe Darren'll leave me alone. - He's your husband. - Oh, Darren's mother is nagging me to cut the cake. Nobody listens. I told them I don't want a traditional wedding. No cake cutting, no garter-tossing, no bouquet-groping, nothing like that! Look, look, Darren and his mother are over there arguing about it right now. Ooh, they should be married. This dress wasn't even my idea. Look at me. I look like a toasted marshmallow fairy! - Hey, it's gonna be great. (mellow jazz music) Look at you, you're beautiful. You're happy, right? - Of course, I'm happy. I married him, didn't I? - I'm sorry. - I mean, I wouldn't marry somebody just to get away from somebody else, would I? - No. - After all, Darren's number three. - I was just thinking aloud. I'll shut up. - Honestly, David, you're suppose to be protecting me. Just move your feet. This is nice, I didn't know you could dance. - I can't, I can only sort of do the touch-step. - You're doing just fine. Ouch! - Oh, uh, sorry. - It's okay. Hey, um, why don't you close your eyes and just feel the music. - [David] What? - You know, sometimes it's better if you can just shut everything else out. (chuckles) Oh yeah, there you go, much better. Now, you're dancin'. - I guess I am. (awkwardly chuckling) Who are you? - Not related. - That's good to know. - I crashed the party from next door. Actually, it's a Radio Outlet convention. Hello, my name is Chris! - Hello, my name is David. - Yeah. - [DJ] Okay, a little change of pace here, folks. - You keep looking the other way. - I'm sorry.

Let me see. - No. - David, I'm your older sister. - I can't. - Are you bleeding? - I'm gonna beat you till you're breathin' out-- - Don't! - Your hairy, pimply ass, Stuey Cartarella! I'm gonna kill him! - [David] But you're a girl. - So? - There are five of them. - God! You are in so big trouble! - Please, don't tell Mom and Dad, please don't! - You're bleeding, how are we-- - Please don't tell them, please! - All right, all right! Let me look at you then. David, your backside, at least. I told you I'm gonna be a veterinarian one day. This'll be good practice for me. Nobody's around. - [David] They held me down and threw ice at me. - David, we've gotta get you to a doctor. - No, Mom and Dad will find out! - All right, all right. Shh, I promise, I won't say anything. At least let me clean up some of the blood. David, what were those boys calling you? I thought maybe I heard them call you a name or something. You don't have to tell me. It's just that I could use the practice for when I become a world famous psychiatrist one day. - [David] I thought you were gonna become a famous veterinarian. - Well, I can be both, can't I? - Yeah. - They called me stupid and stuff. I don't remember. Then they called me faggot. - Why'd they call you that? - Stuey Cartarella said he liked Darth Vader. Then Jackson Randazza said he liked Darth Vader too. Then Betsy said she liked Luke Skywalker and I said I liked Luke Skywalker too. - Okay. - And then Suzy said she wanted to marry Luke Skywalker, and I said I did too. - Ouch. - Yeah. - Did you tell Mr. Clemons? - He said it was my fault for saying that. I wish I was dead. - What? Don't ever say that or I'll kill you! Do you understand? - All right! - Let me finish cleaning you up. Don't listen to those boys. It's just like old Mrs. Pukavidge used to tell us, sticks and stones may break your-- - You don't believe that bullshit, do you? - No, but it sounds good. Here, eat this. It'll make you feel better. It's my last one. - You don't want half? - That's okay. It's got fuzz on it. It's time to go home. - Can't we stay out here? Maybe we'll get abducted by aliens. - Probably you will. David, if we don't go home now, you'll get pneumonia and then Mom will blame me like she always does. - Come on, just for a minute. - David, I'm your older sister. - Only three years! - Three and 3/4! Look, you're shivering! - Okay, I'll stop. I'm not shivering now. - You're a weirdo. - I know. - All right, just another minute, that's it! I'll play you the song that I learned today in class. - No, no, not that again, god. - David, you have to hear me practice or you're gonna be sorry when I become a world famous concert pianist. Your side, David, try your side. See? It's like you're the Queen of England riding your horse side-saddle. ("Of Strange Lands and People") David, don't ever listen to what people say about you if it's not right in your head. Most people are icky people, like Stuey Cartarella, and I hope you get a heart attack soon. - You'll go to hell for saying that. - So will you for being such a freak. - Straight to hell. (chuckles) ("Of Strange Lands and People") - Move in with me. Did you hear what I said? - Yes. - Are we talking? - Yes. I just realized we have to meet Katie. We're gonna be late. - It makes sense. You're always talking about how cramped your place is. Are you gonna give me an answer? - No! - No, that's your answer? What does that mean? - It means, I'm not ready. Look, I can't think about this now. (singing in foreign language) Let's not say anything about this in front of Kate. For her, okay? - Yeah, it's always like that. - What do you mean? - Welcome to little Brazil! - I wish I could go with you. - I do too. - But he has to do the show. It's the Homos versus the Radical Christians tonight. - It's good for ratings! - And I know you'll win. - Chris and I were gonna send you off singing Flying Down to Rio dressed as Fred Astaire and Dolores Del Rio. - [Chris] But then we realized we would have to change the lyrics to Flying Down to Sao Paulo. - And we fought over who looked uglier in drag. - And neither of us can sing. - So we decided-- - [Chris And Dave] Better not. - It was David's idea. - It was Chris's idea. (chuckling) - It's the thought that counts. - Oh, we got something for you. - A corsage? - A South American orchid, you can wear it on the plane. Then you'll look better than Dolores Del Rio. - Much more than either of us. - What's wrong? - I think I just realized for the first time that I'm coming back a mother. - I better get to the station. See you in a month, Mama. - Bye. - Bye. See you at the station. - What's wrong with you two? - He asked me to move in with him. - And? - It's been so fast. He's so sure of himself. I guess I'm afraid of ruining a good thing. - Maybe you should let him know that. I think that would be a good idea. - You should give this to Margaret. - Where'd you find that old thing? - I use it on my show sometimes. - I haven't played that in years. - I hope she's at the lavender age. - She's gonna love it. - Oh, I got her this too, to help out with her preadolescent angst. - It's the complete works of Judy Blume in Portuguese. Oh David, I'm running out of room. You bought books, toys, music. - It gives me an excuse to buy Justin Timberlake CDs. Katie, I've been thinking. You know I want to be involved, but maybe it'd be better for her if I weren't around so much. - What? Are you going back on your promise? - No, I'm just saying maybe we shouldn't tell her about what I do. I mean, my night job, that's all. - What are you talking about? She's gonna find out. It's gonna come up. If she asks then she's old enough to know. That's the way I see it. I'll tell her, okay? What are you ashamed of? - Nothing, I was just-- - Making excuses? Stop worrying, David. She's gonna love you, I know it. I swear, you'd think you were doing the adopting instead of me. Someday, you're gonna make somebody a fabulous mother. - I don't know if I could really be good enough for it. - That's a funny thing to say. - How's your Portuguese? - Ooh, test me, professor! (speaks in Portuguese) That's, how are you?. (speaks in Portuguese) I am fine. (speaks in Portuguese) (car horn honks) (speaks in Portuguese) O Táxi esta aqui! [Taxi's here!] (speaks in Portuguese) Very good. (speaks in Portuguese) - It's excellent. (speaks in Portuguese) Belissima. Very beautiful! (laughing) (speaks in Portuguese) Boa Tarde! Good afternoon! - Look at you! You're the Portuguese Henry Higgins. How about obrigada? That's thank you, that's for you. Obrigada, David! - For what? - I don't know, I just felt like sayin' it. When a man says it, it's Obrigado. Obrigado. - Do you have your tickets? Sim. Passport? Sim. - Copy of homestudy, petition, divorce decrees, financial statements, letters of recommendation? - Be back in 30 days with that kid or else. - I will. Wish me luck. - Luck. - Bye, David! Obrigado! (engine revs) (gentle music) (computer keys clicking) - You're on in five, four. - [Radio Announcer] Gay Talk! ♪ Danger ♪ ♪ Danger Dave ♪ - Welcome to Gay Talk. I'm your host Danger Dave Patrone. Tonight, our much awaited debate with June Handly, host of the radio program, Inspiration in the Late Evening. How are you, June? - I'm fine, David. How are you? - Great. I'd like to open with a topic that has come closer to me over the past few weeks. My sister is adopting a child in South America. She's single and we decided that I'd help her with some of the responsibilities of raising the child. I'm not a legal parent or anything, just an uncle. I'm sure that there are thousands of families out there with similar stories, gay family members that kids get to know and love. - David, if I could just jump in here, I see where you're going with this. You know, first, I just wanna clarify, I am not a homo-hater. God welcomes you, just not the condition. And I applaud you that you wanna help your sister, but you know, children absorb everything from the adults around them. All I ask is that you, you know, sort through your sexual confusion first. Hopefully, one day, your sister will meet an authentic father figure who will replace whatever influence you may have on this child. - Hopefully, you will find an authentic vocation, and it'll replace whatever influence you may have on this planet. - And we need to take a commercial break. Hey David, I will not have this debate reduced to a circus level with name-calling, finger pointing-- - Fine, right, sorry. - [Sports Announcer] Here on-- - You shouldn't have done that, Danger Dave. - [Sports Announcer] Niagara has earned bids to the NCAA Tournament 2000, 2004, and 2008. All those members of the old College Hockey American conference. - I need a coffee, an aspirin, and an antiacid. - [Sports Announcer] Cinderella run-- - You don't drink coffee. - [Sports Announcer] Cameron C., eight goals-- - I know. - [Sports Announcer] And 31 points along the-- (phone rings) - WYBR, please hold. Oh. - [Sports Announcer] Niagara has won 12 of its last 16 games and is nine-- - Yeah, well, he was just. - [Sports Announcer] January 16th, 1997. Tigers lost to EMU. - What's the matter? - [Sports Announcer] February 8th, 1996. That was game-- - Here. Uh, thanks for calling. Yes. Yes, of course. - Who was on the phone? - No one. - You look pale. - Get back in there? - Was that Larry telling me to behave? - Please? David. - Okay, it's just that you looked so serious when you were on the phone, I thought, maybe something was wrong, I don't know. - I'm sorry about earlier. - David, don't, don't! - What? - Just promise me you'll march back in there and no more questions until after the show. - [David] Jeez, what the. (sighs) - [June] David, are you there? - Yes, June. - You know, David, it is a fact that for thousands of years the building block of Western civilization has always been the traditional mom and dad married couple. Are you suggesting that we sacrifice the rights of children to please the political agenda of a very small special interest group? - No. - Well, if not, then what are you suggesting? - I'm suggesting, um. - Well, it appears that our dangerous host is at a loss for words. All right, let's get down to the heart of the matter, David. - Uh, no, um, every bit of credible research on this topic, the American Counseling Association, the American Psychological Association, they all agree that every-- - By a vote. A special interest vote makes you fit to parent? Allow me, if you will, to read a fairly long list of real facts that those folks will never tell you. - I'm all ears. - [June] Statistics show that transference of STDs among gay youth is 23% higher than that among straight youth. The suicide and depression rate is three to seven times higher. A Canadian study of homosexual men who claimed to be in committed relationships lasting longer than one year-- - That was your parents. - [June] Found that only 25%-- - It's your sister. - [June] Reported actually being monogamous. - She was on the commuter flight from Sao Paolo to Vitoria. There was a heavy storm and she didn't want to wait. She didn't make it, David. There were no survivors. - [June] Homosexuality and suicide. It found that-- - I'm sorry, David, I'm sorry, I can't. - [June] And were more likely to have attempted suicide. - You should go home. Your parents, they need you. We can cancel the show. - [June] With that many problems raising your child? Which brings me to my point, David, I don't think you're happy. - David? David? - Hmm? - [June] I mean, why else would you have-- - Do you want someone to drive you home? I can call someone. I can talk to June now. - [June] If you were truly happy in your own life? But first-- - How much longer do we have? - [June] Caller, we have Ashley in Arkansas. - David, we just started. - [June] What do you have to say about homosexuality, Ashley? - [Ashley] Hi. - [June] Hi, Ashley, how old are you? - [Ashley] 10. (chuckles) - [June] I see, and why are you calling in today, Ashley? - [Ashley] About a year ago. - Yes, go on. - [Ashley] About a year ago, my baby sitter. - Did she do anything to you? - [Ashley] She put her hand. - Where? You can tell me. - [Ashley] She put her hand in my skirt and began touching me in a funny way. I mean, it's bad. I could never love my daddy if I knew he was that way. - Ashley, not everyone is like that. - No, she's gone, David. - What do you mean gone? - She's off the air. - Well, bring her back. She needs help. - We can't. - Try, damn it! - Well, you know as well as I do that-- - Will you stop talking you fucking, stupid. - Excuse me? - Don't tell me. Please don't. - You're not really whole, are you, David? You pretend to be happy and smug, but your on-the-air persona is really a cover up, isn't it? For the anger and deep-seated issues that you really have. You would love to have a family, wouldn't you? But you know that's note possible, not in your present lifestyle situation. - Don't lie to me ever again. - [June] You live your life-- - I said, don't. - Day after day with a long list of unfinished, unresolved business. An empty life with no spouse, no children, all because you proudly hide behind the gay lifestyle. Now, I know that you were hurt as a child. And that's why you wave your flag and taunt religious institutions, but you're not really happy, not really healthy, are you, David? Anger, it's the anger of a young man turned against God, turned against everyone who loves him, just to satisfy one sexual aspect of your life. David, are you there? May I take your silence as a weakening of your spirit? I think David may be finding Jesus. Let's pray for David Patrone that he may one day see the beauty of God.

Can I? I talked to Larry at the station. He thinks you might have another chance with the show, maybe in the spring when you're better. I miss her too, David. Do you wanna talk about it? Forget it. Sometimes I wonder if I ever was your boyfriend. - You left me. - I couldn't deal with the silent treatment any more, David. We just avoid everything now. Explain to me a radio show host who can't tell me one word how he feels, just so I can still be part of his life. - You'll never get it. - What, David? What is it I'll never get? Because I've been trying for the past two months. Will you please tell me what it is that is so freakin' beyond me? - Go fuck yourself. - Oh good, more abuse. I bet if you were Danger Dave, I could get you really talking. Here, here's your mic. Does this help? Now can you talk, Danger Dave? That's right. That's what I would expect from some scared little nerd. - Don't call me that. - David. - Don't call me that. - David, David. - Don't call me that. - David, stop it. David! Stop it! David! - It hurts! (gasping) (gentle music) I miss her so much. I don't want to live. I'm no good. I'm no good. - David, yes you are, yes you are. - [David] I'm no good. - [Chris] You are, David. Shh. - This is June Handly closing this evening's program, Inspiration in the Late Evening, spiritual guidance to those in need. We're coming to you live this evening from Elmira, New York. I'm here celebrating my new book, Straight to Grace, with a signing each night in a new city. Tomorrow night, Niagara Falls, New York. So until then, goodnight and God bless! - [Bob] Nice show, June. - Thank you. (June sighs) (knocking) - [David] Hey June. - Do I know you? - You don't recognize my voice? - Uh, maybe I should call Bob. - Do you really think you need to? - Well, you've come a long way to see me, Mr. Patrone. - I've got a lot of free time. I'm not on the radio any more. - Oh. Oh, I see, well, well, if there's anything I can do for you. - I thought if I came to see you face-to-face, I might be able to change your mind. - Uh uh. - I guess I'm just a cock-eyed optimist. - Well, I don't really have too much more to say to you. Some people just refuse to change their desires. - Or can't. - That's all in your mind. - When I was a kid, I tried to convince myself I could just pray or think that part of me away. I wish I never wasted that time. - Really, what are you here then? - I think I still need to connect with something. - With God? - Something like that. - I hope you do see the beauty of God one day, David. - I have. He's at home right now watching Three's Company reruns. - I give up. - It bothers you that I'm okay? That there's really nothing wrong with me, doesn't it? - You know what I really think? I think you choose to ignore the deep pain inside of you, David, but this is a pointless conversation. Look, we are a nationally syndicated radio program with a listening audience over 130 stations in this country alone. I have more important things to do for people who can be changed. We're on the road every day, and I need to go back to my hotel and get some sleep, and email my kids, another show on Monday. You think everything is so simple, but you have nothing to prove to me. Shit. - Let me. - No, I am fine, thank you. Maybe you came down here to mock me like some sort of a freak rather than a real person. - What did you just say? - I said, maybe you only came down here to look at like I'm some kind of a-- - No, just the last part. - I said, mock me like some sort of a freak rather than a real person. - What did you just call yourself? - Freak? - Who would say that? Who would call you that? - What? - Where did you get that from? Could you say that again? - Freak? - Yes! - Why? - Just say it! - Freak. Freak, freak, freak! What? You're a nut. - I'm sorry about that. (gentle music) - [Kate] Hey, David, you goof! Are you gonna help me or not? - Katie, what've you been doing out here all this time by yourself? It's past bedtime. Mom and Dad are worried about you. They're asking why you don't come inside. - Did they say anything to you about your bruises? - Naw, they didn't see. I skipped dinner so I wouldn't have to sit down. - I covered for you, you know. I just told them you weren't feeling well because you swallowed too much chlorine in gym class. - Thanks, I feel better. Not so sore. - Hey, you wanna help me build a fort for my castle in the snow. I'm the queen. - Katie, you're 14. Aren't you a little too old to be playing queen? - You should know, David, you're never too old to play queen. Besides, it's really just for you. Look, there's the enemy. - Wow! - Here, take a snowball. - What? - You remember the scene in Meet Me in St. Louis where the little girl goes ballistic and destroys all the snowmen? - Yeah. - Well, now it's your turn. Watch me. Take that, take that Marcia Nycelo for calling me a lazy blob in front of everyone in gym class just because I had my period. Slut! Your turn. - Take that Jackson Randazzi! - Take that! - Take that Brian Pelzinskio! - Better, this time go for the groin. - Take that! - Take that! - Stuey Cartarella for calling me a freak! (tense music) - Take that Mrs. McCallister for saying that I'm not talented enough to ever play the piano! - What? - I dub you Sir David, Official Freak of Buffalo. May it be your greatest asset. - And I dub you Katie, Queen of the Freaks. - You can't dub me, you goof, I'm already the queen. - Katie, you never told me about those things. - What things? - About Marcia Nycelo and Mrs. McCallister, what they said. - You were just a kid, you still are, you goof!

They're all clean and everything. (Mrs. Peterston chuckles) I thought I'd stop by to see how my buddy is doing. Did I do that, did I wake him? - [Mrs. Peterston] Oh no, we haven't been able to get little Poo-Poo to settle in. We think it's because of his new medication. Oh sweetie, hi honey. You better? - Did my friends drop by? - They did, and great news, they decided to adopt. - That is great. - Yeah. Gosh, I was so surprised. I mean, two ladies and their own lesbian rock band. Now, how cool is that? - That's cool. - Ooh, oh, oh, oh, look at that, look at that, you gonna settle down now? Can we get you to get to sleep? You need to take your nap. - Can I try? - Are you sure?

Margaret. (speaking in Portuguese) Your new parent will be here soon. Can't you play us one last tune?] (children playfully chattering) (speaking in Portuguese) Don't worry, this is fine. Margaret. (speaking in Portuguese) I told her you're her new father. Come be with her, maybe she doesn't believe us. - What do you mean? - When she first got the piano from your sister, she was so happy. She played her music sheet every day. Margaret waited for months. When no one showed up, she gradually stopped playing. - You mean no one told her what happened? - Should we have told her, Mr. Patrone? Should we have made up excuses for the dozen other potential parents that she expected that just fell by the wayside for reasons we don't even know? It's too much for them. They're clothed, fed, and we hold them when they cry. The rest we leave it up to God. - Ola. This is for you. (speaks in Portuguese) You can play it on the air plane on the way to your new home. You don't have to play it if you don't want to, most prodigies need a hiatus anyway. And this is also for you. It's an Etch a Sketch. (speaks in Portuguese) Etch um Esboco. (speaks in Portuguese) Desenho See? And this, from Chris, my friend. And um, Margaret, do you know who I am? Você sabe quem eu sou? It was my sister who first wanted to adopt you. (speaks in Portuguese) Minha irma foi quem quis te adotar. The piano and the sheet music was from my sister. She wanted to adopt you, but she passed on trying to get here. Mas ela morreu tentando chegar aqui. (peaceful music) That's why she never came. It wasn't because she didn't love you. She loved you very much. When I first heard about you, I fell in love with you too. I thought, we have something in common. When those boys called you names, they didn't know what they were saying. They were wrong. Esses meninos estavam errados. My sister and I were going to raise you together. When she died, I wasn't sure if I could do it. It seemed impossible to me. I know it was a long wait. Uma longa espera. I'm sorry. Sinto muito. But I'm here to be your father, if you'll have me. Do you want me to be your father? You might have another father too. Outro pai? I mean, if you want. My Portuguese sucks. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. (speaks in Portuguese) I'm sorry. (speaks in Portuguese) I'm sorry your sister is dead. I'm sorry? (piano keys plonk) (speaks in Portuguese) I forget. ("Of Strange Lands and People") (speaks in Portuguese) This music was hers. (speaks in Portuguese) This music was hers Dear Katie, we're doing just fine, you'll be glad to know. I'm back on the air with Gay Talk. Dad no longer builds birdhouses. Both Mom and Dad are too busy spoiling you know who. Margaret speaks English better than any of us, loves her new piano, runs up a wicked phone bill, and she's already expressed an interest in boys, or they in her. This makes Chris and I somewhat nervous, but we are both actively giving good fashion tips. Which reminds me, you can lose the snowsuit. We're planning to visit Brazil again someday. In fact, we don't speak English very much any more. Portuguese is our preferred language. People sometimes look at us funny when we're walking down the street and maybe there's someone, somewhere who even says bad things but we don't care. Well, that's it for now. Oh, I almost forgot. Obrigado That's thank you. Obigado, Katie.
