(VO)Above all the courts of justice in this world.. ..is a certain court of justice. And that court of justice is a person's conscience. There is no higher court of justice than a person's conscience. Our film 'Damini'.. ..is based on these words of Gandhiji. (Thunder Rumbling) (Breathing Heavily) (Wind Whooshing) No! No! Go away! What's wrong? Scared, are you? Why are you scared? What is it? Why isn't anyone of them here? They've all gone home. Yes, they've gone home. Would you like to go home, too? Yes. - Who will you go home with? With mother. - Your mother won't be coming here. She said she can't take you home. Why were you brought here? Speak up.. why were you brought here? They said.. I wasn't all right. But I'm all right.. - Rubbish. Why have you applied that colour on your arm? Why have you applied that? I didn't do this.. ..they did. I even have a bruise. (Crying) Where's your house? You can't remember. Right? I know.. - What do you know? I'll tell you later. - Tell me now.. speak up! It's far away. - What? It's far away. - Far away, eh? All right, prepare to administer shock treatment. (Music Playing) Where are you dragging me, Dilip? We'll be bored to death! Let's go to the hotel and discuss the board meeting tomorrow. I'll fix all that. Come. The show is about to begin. What show can we expect here in a town like Nasik? All right. You must have been to the best of shows in Bombay. But this dance will have you spinning! - I'm with you. "I swing without my love. How can I forget my promise to him?" "I swing without my love. How can I forget my promise to him?" "I feel like reaching out to the skies.." "I come flying, bringing the rains with me.." "I come flying, bringing the rains with me.." "You live in my heart, my love.." "I swing without my love. How can I forget my promise to him?" "I have suffered for years, don't punish me anymore.." "I can't bear this distance. Come into my arms.." "My eyes always looked for you.." "You don't know how I spent my days and nights.." "The roses are young. There's romance in the air.." "They bring along a new life. Come to me.." "I swing without my love. How can I forget my promise to him?" "I swing without my love. How can I forget my promise to him?" "I feel like reaching out to the skies.." "I come flying, bringing the rains with me.." "You live in my heart, my love.." "I swing without my love. How can I forget my promise to him?" "My heart pines for you.." "You make my dreams come alive.." "My heart pines for you.." "You make my dreams come alive.." "I'm so lonely. Questions bother me." "I'm puzzled. So come to me.." (Crowd Applauding) Wow! - This is a fabulous dance! A beautiful girl, isn't she? She was fantastic! And how about Aamir Khan? - He's good, too. But she.. Let's meet the girl and congratulate her. Come on! Oh, come on! We've got to talk. - What about the meeting? We must congratulate these newcomers. It boosts their self-confidence. Come on.. Thank you, Mr. Khan for taking some time out.. ..for the school's charity programme. There! - We're grateful to you. I'm grateful to you for this opportunity. We work for ourselves everyday. It feels good to do something charitable. It gives me peace of mind. - You're very kind. Thanks a lot, Aamir. Your appearance had a great effect on the show. I don't think I alone.. - Don't say that. You were the life of the show. You're a great dancer. In fact, an artist like you belongs in the film industry. - Yes. I could talk to some people, if you're interested. Films? No, thank you.. I can't act. I do a bit of what my teacher taught me, with great difficulty. And I still end up making mistakes. I take part in these charity shows whenever there's an opportunity. I'm happy with this. That's how she is. And that's nice. The way she is. May we leave? - Sure. Don't you know what to say? - They're coming. What more should I have said? The show went off well, didn't it? "I swing without my love.." Mr. Aamir, congratulations. - Hello. Meet Mr. Shekhar Gupta of Gupta & Sons. You were fantastic! - Thank you. I'm an ardent fan of yours. I saw your film 'Dil' 22 times. When is 'Andaz Apna Apna' releasing? - Very soon. Make it soon, so that.. Okay, bye. - Bye. Mr. Gupta, bye. See.. And you're responsible. - Am I? Of course! You shoot your mouth at every place you can. Am I a chatter-box? - Am I one? Yes, you are! - You're the one! You! All right. I'm the one - Devika. Oh. Birju. Devika, it's all right, isn't it? Our matter.. - What is it? I'm not talking to you. - Why ask again? Haven't I already told you? So I should be there, then? - What is he talking about? Never mind. (Crying) Shanti! Father! How did Shanti.. Let's go. You shouldn't be watching all this. Go on.. Come along, dear. That's how girls are. They should be married the moment they come of age. And what did Shanti want to prove by committing suicide? Won't they get a bad name now? Her poor father. I met him the other day. The poor fellow was complaining that he couldn't arrange for her dowry. Regardless of how poor the girl's father is.. ..he won't get his daughter married to a worthless, useless man! No matter what you say, we have two daughters of marriageable age. They're getting older. - As if I don't understand! I'm not twiddling my thumbs! You're not the only one who's worried. Can't you request someone and.. I just have to grovel now! Dowry, relations, horoscopes.. everything has to be looked into! We must look into their family background. But you're always nagging me! (Crying) I've been telling you! Poison me and end my misery! I'm the unfortunate mother, after all. But why should you die? It's I who should do that! I'm unfit! I have fathered those girls, but I can't get them married! I'll commit suicide, that'll end the story! You can run the house on the pension. Look after your girls, too. (Crying) I'm leaving with Birju tonight. - With Birju? Where to? To Bombay. A relative of his owns a factory. Once we reach there.. - Are you crazy? How could you let that drunkard mislead you? What does he know? The loafer! He only drinks and watches movies! (Thunder Rumbling) But he could change after marriage, couldn't he? I want to give myself a chance in life. You're punishing yourself! - Never mind. It'll at least lessen Dad's burden. I want to live. Won't you help me? But, sister.. - Please! (Crying) Write to me. - I will. She told you last night. Why didn't you tell me? She hasn't done anything wrong. She has humiliated us in society! What society are you talking about? Has anyone ever stepped forward to help us? Sure, your Laxminarayan did. He sympathised with us.. and sought sister's hand in marriage. He has two daughters as old as her! The lecherous old rascal! The creep! And Ram Mohan? He got engaged to sister in everybody's presence. He just severed it. And why? For dowry. How much did you plead with him? Did anyone help? Mom even fell at his feet. No one had anything to say, they just watched the fun. Darn society! You're worried about people.. ..who will never do anything for us. This is exactly what leads to demands like dowry, horoscopes.. Girls end up spinsters in their homes. What happens is my concern! You don't understand what the girls go through. Shanti's father couldn't either. Shekhar? - Yes, Mom? Go on. Where were you last evening? Last evening? Don't ask what I went through, mom. What's up? Are you all right? I am. And I'm not. Mr. Bajaj is here. Talk to him. That's just what I couldn't do, Mom! Pray that I meet her and talk to her. Disconnected? Yes. The line got disconnected. He was being weird. Don't get a man married on time, and he goes astray. Am I right, Mr. Gupta? - Speaking from experience, eh? (Laughing) Look at him. He's younger than Shekhar. But isn't he happy because he's married? Uncle.. - I'd advise you to get Shekhar married at the earliest. My daughter will handle the rest. Right, uncle? Lucy and Shekhar are made for each other. The day they get married, both Gupta and Bajaj can rejoice! (Laughing) What happened, dear? What happened to my daughter? Nothing, Papa. I spilt some tea. - Impertinent woman! You spilled hot tea on her! Get me some ice, please. Get some ice. Don't look here, witch! Just get lost! The uneducated idiot! Apply some Burnol, please.. Apply some Burnol, please.. Don't watch us, idiot! Just get lost! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just can't bear anything happening to Lucy. She hasn't had a mother, you see. All I dream is for her to be your daughter-in-law. (Music Playing) "Ever since I've set my eyes on you.." "..I've been so restless." "Ever since I've set my eyes on you.." "..I've been so restless." "Ever since I have desired you.." "..I've been so restless." "You have robbed me of my sleep." "Oh, how my passions torment me." "Whenever I remember you, I feel a bittersweet pain.." "Ever since I've found you.." "I've been dreaming all day.." "Ever since I have desired you.." "..I've been so restless." "Ever since I've set my eyes on you.." "..I've been so restless." "Ever since I have desired you.." "..I've been so restless.." (Birds Chirping) Excuse me.. where does Ms. Damini live? There she is. - Where? - There. Why don't you send him to school? He's always sitting here. He refuses to go. What do I do? - How can he refuse? Won't you go? How will you be a great man if you don't study? Send him over to my place. I'll fix him. How about some pedas (Indian sweet)? Taste this. It's made of pure clarified-butter. Taste it. Go on, sir. I'll give you a kilo of laddoos (Indian sweet), too. People come from far and wide to try my sweet-meats. Once they've eaten, they head straight for the hospital! Didn't some children fall sick last week? - What are you saying, Damini? The same rotten stuff! - She's a rotten girl! Six children. - I'll complain to your father! You're ruining my business. Sure. If you don't stop adulterating your stuff.. ..I'll hang a signboard. "Beware of Mewalal's adulterated sweets" I mean it. It's meant for the flies. Let me show you a nice shop. Damini! Watch out! Your cherished truth is going to cost you some day! Is it a sin to speak the truth? - No. (Temple Bell Tolling) Yet nobody speaks the truth! Right? Yes. - There's hanky-panky everywhere. Am I right? And everyone's keeping quiet. - Hold this. There's a temple near my house. The priest there sells the coconuts he receives for the Lord! Coconuts are being sold and resold, but no one speaks up! Sold and resold.. - They're all silent! That's how things are! And if I speak up, my sister scolds me. Devika. She says I talk too much. Do I really talk too much? - No, you don't speak much. Exactly! One needs to speak up when required.. ..or such things will keep happening. - What will keep happening? Who are you talking to? Who's he? Actually, it was pedas.. - Mr. Pede, eh? No. My name is Shekhar.. - Shekhar Pede, I see. It's Shekhar Gupta. My name is Shekhar Gupta. - Oh. - Yes. What brings you here? I.. You must've heard of Gupta Industries, Gupta Mills.. Oh, yes. They belong to Mr. Kedarnath Gupta. That's right. I'm his elder son. - I see! I'm here on business. By the way, I saw your show. - Really. You're a wonderful dancer. Great. (Birds Chirping) I want to marry your daughter. Pardon me? - Yes. My father can talk to you, if you wish. Why should he? I will.. - Why do you want to marry? Pardon me? - I mean, why do you want to marry me? You don't know me well enough. We've just met. How can you.. Ms. Damini, sometimes one doesn't strike a chord for years. And yet, one meeting with someone.. ..and you think you've known them for years. Yes. Don't you think so? A post-master's daughter will now be my daughter-in-law. At least meet her, Mom. - Shut up! Our relatives are ridiculing us. The younger son is already married. And you.. you're still a bachelor. How would they know that the younger son didn't marry of his own volition.. ..we had to get them married. They had an affair in college, you see. Had we not accepted the poor girl, she would have been ruined! But Deepa from the Agarwal family. She's not some poor girl. Damini comes from a poor family, all right. But she has great ideals and a lot of talent. You got to know of everything in just one meeting! Yes, Mom. I have this feeling that it's Damini that I've been.. Mom, please! Damini? What sort of name is that! - What's wrong? Disgusting! Compare her with a real gem. Mr. Bajaj's daughter..Lucy. Will you keep quiet, Uncle? - I think we must meet the girl. Oh, thank you, Dad. But tell me something, son. - Yes? What's so special about her? Well, you're meeting her soon. Find out for yourself. Hurry up, dear. They've been waiting for so long. One minute, Mom. Nice tea-set! Of course. Mom said to be careful with the hot tea or it'll break. It cost Rs.52 a pair. - I see. Damini made this herself. - Oh, really? She's always been interested in crafts. Embroidery and knitting.. she's an expert at it. She's simply outstanding in dance and music too. Of course. We saw that! It was there that.. No.. I.. I don't see your elder daughter, Devika. Where is she? - At her uncle's, you know.. - Uncle? She's away at her uncle's. - I see. If they ask about your sister, say she's away at your uncle's. Don't talk too much, all right. You're a regular chatter-box. Bring Damini out here. Let's go. Excuse me.. Before you make up your mind, I want to tell you something. Go on. My sister, Devika.. - She's away at her uncle's. No. She has gone to Bombay. With Birju. Birju used to stay in the neighbourhood. She'll be marrying him in Bombay. Careful.. that costs 52 Rupees a pair! It comes from the neighbour's. You did a good thing by telling us. Nobody cares to be so candid nowadays.. That's what is special about you. It will not affect our decision. Am I right, Dad? - What can I say? Shall we ask the priest to look for an auspicious date for the wedding? Congratulations, sir! Shekhar, congratulations! Bless you. - Congratulations! To you, too. Thanks a lot! Get some sweets.. Some sweet-meats, I mean. Quick. (Crackers Sound) "You always wear nine bangles.." What are you doing here with the women? You ought to be out with the guests! Go on. Everyone needs me, you know. How can I handle them all? Here you are. The Seeta necklace. A family ornament. It now belongs to you. Because you're the elder daughter-in-law. It costs Rs.900,000, you know. Rich people, rich gifts. - This is strange, Sumitra. You didn't gift such things to your younger daughter-in-law. But the moment she steps into the house.. What value does this necklace hold for my younger daughter-in-law? She brought two boxes full of gold in dowry. But this poor girl.. She's a lucky girl that Shekhar took a liking to her. And Shekhar has always been the soft-hearted man. Remember? He brought a little kitten home from the street? Why are you bringing up those old tales? I'm only trying to tell you that he hasn't changed. He hasn't rid himself of his old habits. What are you up to? The new bride isn't supposed to work so much. You act like a grandma! Don't you handle all the household chores, too? So what? It's like my own house. Give that to me. - Let go, I say. I'm cooking a dish for my husband. You experience a different kind of joy cooking for your husband. I see! (Laughing) Damini! - Yes, uncle? Could you knit a flower on my kurta? - Sure, I will. Damini.. - Yes, auntie? Could you have the sari on my bed sent to the laundry? Very well. The kurta goes to.. (Laughing) All right. Embroidery and the laundry. - Damini? Yes, Mummy? - We're all going to Mr. Gupta's for a prayer ceremony. All right. I'll finish the chores and come over with Deepa. No. Deepa's joining us. So stay back here and help Urmi. We're expecting guests this evening. All right. There's so much to do. Let's get cracking. After we finish our work, let's watch TV. It's a minor gash, Urmi. It's okay. What's wrong with you? I don't know why, but I feel very sad when I see you in pain. Damini! Where are you? - Oh. There's nobody else at home. Where are you?! I'm here upstairs. Could you cook that, Urmi? I'll be back soon. You experience a different kind of joy cooking for your husband. All right. I'll cook it myself. If he lets you go! What! What did you say? (Laughing) You can't break this partnership! I'll lose millions! We had already decided.. - It was also decided.. ..that Shekhar would marry my daughter. You can't link marriage with business! Everything a businessman does is linked with something, Gupta. Now look. Whatever has happened.. Nothing has happened. It all begins now. I've seen you rise, Gupta. I'll now see you fall. A loss of Rs.150 million?! That's just for Baroda, sister. Another Rs.200 million in Calcutta and it works out to Rs.350 million. Just Rs.650 million short of a Rs.1 billion. Neither Shekhar nor my husband told me anything about this. How would they? All this has happened because of Damini. Bajaj is the enemy. (Birds Chirping) What's going on? - Nothing. Nothing my foot! You're making those birds fly away. I was only.. - What! These are singing birds, you know. - Oh? Yes. They sing. Birds don't sing in a cage. They only cry. How are you finding it here, Damini? - Me.. - Yes. I'm afraid. I feel as if I don't belong here. I wonder what you saw in me that you married me, without even.. I'm always thinking of doing something.. ..that will keep you happy. You don't need to do anything. You're perfect as you are. I wish I could make it my aim to fulfil everyone of your desires. Your joys and laughter mean everything to me. I wish I could keep looking at you.. ..just looking at you.. - Mom! (Laughing) Scared me, didn't you? I'll fix you this evening. And don't touch that cage, okay? Just release those birds! - Really? (Music Playing) "The Moon and stars are witnesses.." "The moon and stars are witnesses.." "Witnesses of our union.."

"Damini.. Damini.. Damini is yours." (Drums Playing) Damini! No.. please! A little, okay? - Okay. A little here, a little here.. Greetings on your first Holi. My turn now. - Okay. But very little colour. - Really? It might get in my eyes. Oh, yes. Hey, I won't spare you. No, no, let me go. - It's Holi. What are you up to? Stop it. She's asking you not to. Go downstairs. There's a lot to do downstairs. Go on. Sure, ma'am. I'll get some sweetmeats. Where have you been? People are asking for sweet-meats. Yes, first I'll.. - Give this to me. First go and fetch sweet-meats. - All right. I'm coming. Urmi? Urmi! - Ma'am! Urmi! - Ma'am! Leave her, Rakesh. - Ma'am! Leave her, Rakesh. Get away. Leave her. - Get away. Leave her! - Get away. Ma'am! No! Help me. No. - Leave her, Rakesh. No! - Rakesh. Shekhar! Shekhar! - Come down! Come up! No! First listen to what I have to say. Rakesh and his friends have taken Urmi up there. Hurry up. Anything can happen there. - No! No! Rakesh. - No. Rakesh. Rakesh. Shall I call father? - Shut up! Rakesh. Rakesh. Oh. Damini. Damini. Give me the car keys! - What's happened to Urmi? Move. - Where are you taking her? Hurry up! Rascal! Aren't you ashamed of doing such a thing? I'll kill you! You'll kill him just because he has made a mistake? Yes! That girl has grown up in this house. How can he do this? Just because she's a maid? Shekhar, enough! - Shekhar! You should be ashamed of yourself! Shekhar, take care of Damini. I'll handle the rest! Go, please. - Disgraceful. What sin did I commit that such a son was born to me? Forgive me, Dad. - Go to your in-law's place. If anybody asks you, say that you have been there for a few days. Say that you had gone there to celebrate Holi! Get lost from here. - Come. Go! - Come on. Be careful. Urmi? Relax. - How is Urmi? How are you feeling? Where is she? She's fine. She has gone home. How can she be fine? We should go to her immediately. She'll need us. She'll need a doctor. When she sees us.. - We can't go there. Why? There.. it'll become a police case. You haven't informed the police yet? The police? It's about Rakesh. Sir, the master has called you downstairs. - All right. The police is here. Say that we are coming. - All right. The police is there downstairs. It's possible that they might interrogate you. Just say that you haven't seen anything. I'll explain later, but just say that. Just say that you were in your room. You haven't seen a thing. Don't forget. I have already told you that Urmi.. ..hasn't been working here since the past seven days. She was thrown out when caught her stealing. What do we have to do with what she does outside? Urmi has mentioned your son Rakesh's name in her statement. So what difference does it make? She was an immoral girl. Sumita, keep quiet. - Brother-in-law.. I'll make a call to Delhi. He'll be transferred right away. - Who are you threatening? A poor girl has been raped in this house. And all of you? What nonsense! This is a decent family. Mind your tongue. Urmi has said everything in her statement. She also said that Damini has seen everything. I want to meet Damini and take her statement. Damini isn't feeling well. She hasn't even come out of her room. Meet her tomorrow. You may ask her whatever you like. Not tomorrow. Right away! - But she can't meet you! Now look.. Bring Damini downstairs. We regret what has happened. But if things worsen, Rakesh's life will be ruined. He has a wife.. a child. Reply to the police cautiously. The honour of this family is now in your hands. Speak, Ms. Damini. Whatever happened with Urmi, you've seen it with your own eyes. Urmi has also stated that you tried to help her. It's abominable. The perpetrators dumped her in the sewer. And now that poor girl is fighting for her life at the hospital. Tell me, Ms Damini. Who were those people? If you speak the truth, Urmi will get justice. Help her. My husband must have told you.. ..that I'm not well. I was in my room all day. What you're saying.. I don't know anything. You're lying. For God's sake, speak the truth. For Urmi's sake, speak the truth.. Good night, officer. Your lie may prove to be very expensive for Urmi. No, I don't want to hear anything. You lied to me? You told me that Urmi is all right! What else could I do, Damini? As it is, you're not feeling well. Think about Urmi. That poor girl is there. And we.. Instead of doing something for her, everybody is lying. And you made me lie too? - Yes, I made you lie. Because the truth will ruin everything. We'll have to suppress this matter. What? - Yes. Rakesh is my brother. It's a family matter. How can one hand him over to the police? The police will do what they have to. We shouldn't be thinking about all this. Before our very eyes, Urmi was.. We should help her, come what may. Why don't you understand? This isn't the time to be emotional. If this matter is pursued.. ..Rakesh and his friends will be punished. The reputation of four families will be ruined! She served you all her life. Today she's in the hospital. And you talk about reputation. Try to understand. Look, nobody will lose anything. Truth can never cause a loss to anybody. And it never will. We'll meet her right away. We'll take your mother along. She'll be comforted. Urmi will feel good when she seeing us. Take me to her, please. I want to meet Urmi. She must be expecting us. She must be expecting me. (Crying) The rape has taken place at the right time. Now I'll rape the honour of Gupta's family. Let the games begin. (Tv Playing) (Laughing) We thought that he'll rescue us on hearing us out. But no.. he continues to play. Brother-in-law.. listen to what I have to say. Let's go to Jaunpur. Thank God that a plot of land had been put aside. It's come in handy at a time of crisis. Will you please shut up? Mr. Chaddha! Everything has been done. The date.. hearing.. and the judgement. Mr. Gupta.. everybody knows.. ..that when Barrister Chaddha takes up a case.. ..the court date is determined later. The judgement is determined in my favour. But the matter getting worse. The police come into our home whenever they like. What the boys have done is nothing too serious. Such things are common in one's youth. Everyone indulges. The only foolish thing was that if they wanted to do all this.. ..they could've consulted me in advance. Anyway, you better keep this in mind for the future. What is to be done now? Mr. Gupta.. I have understood all the moves of this game. I have also understood that your son Shekhar.. ..and your daughter-in-law are drawbacks. Especially the daughter-in-law. What's her name? Damini! She's very emotional. And the police will sense this weakness very soon. And the police will begin harassing her. Get her out of the city at the earliest. What are you saying? Damini is my daughter-in-law My son Shekhar loves her dearly. Love, friendship, emotions, and relationships.. ..are very ordinary and weak things. These things can make us loose a winning battle. If one is afflicted with them, defeat is certain. And I, Inderjeet Chaddha, never accept defeat. I'll ruin everything. But I won't accept defeat. Ma'am! Help, ma'am! Urmi! Urmi! Urmi! Urmi! Urmi! Urmi! I'm Urmi! (Laughing) I'm sorry. Damini.. what happened? Control yourself. You don't know what it's doing to me looking at you like this. I agree. What you say is absolutely right. But you tell me.. how can I go against my own family? What should I do? What should I do? I know that the family is angry with me. I don't want to hurt anybody. But a sin has taken place in this house. And I'm unable to wipe it away from my mind. You teach me.. You explain to me.. How should one kill one's own conscience? Explain to me. Because this is disturbing me severely. I'm suffocating. Help me. Help me, Shekhar. Tell us, who were those people? What are their names? Tell me, who took the car keys? Speak up! - I don't know, sir. It's good that the servants didn't speak out. Otherwise, all of us would've been behind bars by now. The police are thirsty for our blood. They are not even prepared to speak to us, let alone be bribed. I don't understand anything. Before the police make Damini say anything.. ..send her far away from here. - But she should be willing! She's only saying that she wants to meet Urmi. Shekhar is somehow preventing her from doing so. It has been four days since the incident happened. Urmi is still alive at the hospital. And Damini is not letting us live in peace. It would've been better if she was dumped on the train tracks. Please! We'll have to somehow convince Damini that Urmi has recovered.. ..and she has gone to her village with her grandfather. Somehow send Damini to Delhi with Shekhar. It's very important to make Damini speak the truth. Use your intelligence instead of your force. But sir.. - Do whatever you have to. Win over Damini's trust. Wait here. I'll check in the luggage. Hello, Ms. Damini. I'm Inspector Ratan. I tried to meet you several times. But your family members didn't allow me. So I.. - If my family members don't want you to meet me.. ..then you shouldn't speak to me like this. By the time you return, Urmi may not be alive anymore. She's dying. She's in the hospital. Look at this! Urmi's condition is very severe. She's bleeding continuously. She can't get up from her bed. She's waiting for you. She may have be handicapped for the rest of her life. She might die too. Look, Ms. Damini.. What nonsense is this? - You see.. Mr. Gupta! I'll teach you a lesson. Who do you think you are? If you are a cop, can you do anything you like? You're her husband. So will you have your way with her? I'll take you to bloody court. Take you to bloody court! I will make you realize that money is not everything. Go and threaten somebody else! How dare you manhandle a cop! - Shut up! You will regret it He's misusing his position. Sometimes at home, sometimes at the airport.. This is no way to behave. If you are a cop, can you do anything you like? Why are you determined to go to the hospital? What'll come of it? I wonder what the Inspector has told you! You're so adamant about going to the hospital. We won't go to the hospital. We can't go. Mr. Chaddha said that.. ..none of the family members should visit the hospital. The police may make another case. But you're just so insistent! I thought of taking you somewhere for sightseeing. Since I was going to Delhi on work.. I thought of mixing business and pleasure. Why are you silent? Why don't you say something? It's very necessary that I go to Delhi. I can't miss the last flight. Get up. I won't go. Then go to the hospital and meet Urmi. She means everything to you. We don't mean anything to you. This house, our dignity, doesn't that matter to you? Tell the police everything. Ruin everything. Darn it! You'll feel relieved. Let my brother be hanged. I don't want that. I only.. Let us meet Urmi just once. If she's fine, if her treatment is proceeding properly.. Let's make sure. - What exactly do you want? Do you think that we are Urmi's enemies? Are we beasts? Whatever needs to be done is being done. Dad said that he's willing to pay any amount.. ..to the girl's family to suppress the matter. The family's reputation will remain clean and.. What? You're putting a price on that girl? Will money bring back everything she has lost? People who can have such thoughts.. ..can even kill for the sake of their honour. They can kill anybody. It's possible that even I.. (Airplanes Sound) Ma'am! Ma'am! Urmi. - Oh, ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am! No.. - Ma'am! Why didn't you come all these days? Urmi, I.. Nobody came. Nobody came. (Crying) I didn't know that you.. I was told that you're fine. No, ma'am. I'm not well. I'm in great pain. I'll speak to the doctor. I'll arrange for your medicines and everything else. Once you recover, come home again. Home? No, I won't go home. I'll go to my village. To my grandfather. Your grandfather didn't come? You're all alone? - Yes. I'm not sure if somebody has informed him. I'll inform him. Your grandfather will come. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. I'll never recover. - Yes, you will. No. - You shouldn't say that. Look! My bleeding doesn't stop. You have done the police a great help by agreeing to testify. But what are you doing for Urmi? Is the your duty done by getting her to the hospital? She isn't receiving proper treatment or good care. Her grandfather has not been informed. A constable has been sent to her village. Ms. Damini, will you reverse your statement in future? What? - I mean your husband isn't here right now. When he returns and pressurises you.. - No. I should have told you the truth earlier. That day.. I wonder why.. I'll never lie again. I only want Urmi to recover. Her condition is not good. We should admit her to a good hospital so that.. Everything will be fine. You're with us now. Whatever you have seen, remember it.. ..and get it recorded in your statement. Go ahead! Will my statement.. ..cause problems for my husband and parents-in-law? Because they are not at fault at all. Don't worry. I'm there. Make your statement without any fear. Go ahead. (Phone Ringing) Inspector Kadam. - Tell me, Kadam. - Hello, sir. Good that you phoned, sir. Damini's making her statement. Good news. Our case has become strong now. Yes, sir. She's giving her statement right here. I have convinced her. Mr. Gupta telephoned. A sum of Rs.300,000 has been finalised. Congratulations. Now that we have a statement, we'll get more money. Very good. Just a minute. Mr. Bajaj, we have made Damini speak. Gupta is paying Rs.300,000 to close the case. Whatever amount Gupta is paying to suppress the case.. ..take Rs.100,000 more and keep the case alive. Let's see whether the case is closed or whether it's kept alive. The case is becoming quite important. Handle it intelligently. Sir, think about my promotion. You'll get your promotion too, Kadam. Why do you worry? Thank you. - Come on. Get up, fast. Why? Why, sir? - Come on. Come on. Your father is affluent. Listen to me.. - Come on. As soon as, my husband comes, you'll lose your jobs. Let me make a call to Delhi. - Call wherever you like. The warrant has been issued on Damini's testimony. Do whatever you like. Sister, that Damini? Damini! Come downstairs. - Come down. So you have spilled out venom at the police station! Are you relieved now? We've been unlucky since Shekhar saw you. Everything is ruined. Get out of the house now. I knew that in this house.. I did what I thought was right for this family's well-being. If I have committed any mistake unknowingly, please forgive me. Wherever I live, I'll always pray for this family's well-being. A woman is supposed to be a man's subordinate. And this woman is challenging men? I'll never let Damini set an example for other women. I'll send her to a mental asylum. How is that girl related to you? What's her relationship with you? She is a girl like I am. Is this not enough of a relationship? I don't want to argue with you. It's their greatness.. ..that they still want to take you back to their home. A girl's real home is with her husband, not her father. Who made this tradition that a girl's real home.. ..is with her husband, not with her father? A house where she grows up.. ..one fine day, the same home is no longer hers. Does the forging of new relationship sever all old relationships? Does that girl have no right in that house? We don't mean that, dear. - Why does a girl alienated. Why do her parents think she is her in-laws' property? For any reason, if she has to leave her in-law's house.. ..where will she go? Should she commit suicide? That's not what tradition says. Child.. - At the time of her marriage, does the father.. ..give away his daughter, or does he perform her last rites? Enough, daughter. Try to understand me. It's not a matter of a few days. It's a matter of all your life. How long will we old people live? Give up your insistence. Don't be afraid. Your picture will appear on television. The whole world should know what has happened to you. Zoom into the face. The mark on the face should be seen. What's going on? - Move back! When you were raped by all those people, how did you feel? What an absurd question this is! Why are you disturbing us? Come back over here. Please.. - Let us do our work. Yes.. - I want this mark. Move her away. The mark will be seen only when there's light. What are you people doing? - Are you her relative? I'm Damini! Damini Gupta! - Damini Gupta! Damini Gupta! - Damini Gupta! Ms. Damini! - Naresh, pan the camera in this direction. Hello, I'm Rita Upadhyay from Network. You must have watched our video magazine. This is Damini Gupta, Kedarnath Gupta's daughter-in-law. Where did this old man come from? Get him out of here. He's the girl's grandfather! - Grandfather? Yes. - Make him sit. Seat him. Is this okay? - All right? No, make him stand up. Give backlight. What are your thoughts about rape? - What's going on? Ms. Damini, how did you get the strength to speak.. ..against women's exploitation? - What is this? Pan the camera from the grandfather to Ms. Damini. Bring an expression of anger and a little pain on your face. Ms. Damini, the sari border isn't suitable. Can another sari be arranged? - Let it be. Pick her up a little. - Yes, of course! Move away! Aren't you people ashamed? You want to sell somebody's devastation? You can't see this innocent girl's pain. You can only her sari's border! What? What do you want to know? What do you want to see? Look at this! Why? Why have you closed your noses? You like to write and publish the truth. But you can't see it. You need a handkerchief to see it? Go away. You see, we.. - Go away! Go away, otherwise I'll start screaming. Damini left home, and you didn't let me know about it? Whenever I phoned from Delhi.. - What could we have done? You had so many worries at work. And.. There's life apart from business too, Dad. Damini is emotional. But she's not bad at heart. I could've returned, and set things right. You say as if it was our fault and we threw her out of the house. We had begged her not to leave. No, it's a lie. Damini can't do such a thing. How wonderful, dear! Damini has influenced you in such a short time. You're sad at her having left home. But your own brother has been taken away by the police. Doesn't that bother you? - Mom! It does. Rakesh.. Damini too is.. Mom! Dad.. You should.. You must be tired. Take rest. We have suffered hardships since childhood. Father and mother have been so worried about our marriage. There was so much suffering. And today.. when you have everything.. Sister, I haven't forgotten anything. I understand everything. But an innocent person's life is ruined, and everybody is quiet. And they want me to remain quiet, too. I can't remain quiet. If I remain quiet, wouldn't I be party to sin? No.. don't! Looks like the sun has risen from the west today! Ms. Damini.. in our humble home? Mr. Shekhar didn't come? - No. He's not an ordinary person, after all. He's in charge of a business worth millions. But bring him sometime. I want to show him my programme. 'Birju Mimicry Artist All-In-One.' Please bring water for me. She doesn't understand my talent. The Goddess' statue? How wonderful! I do holy shows free. Here.. Have you brought our son's medicine? Our son's medicine? - I gave you the money this morning. It so happened that I met my friends on the way. We played cards. Sometimes I won, sometimes I lost. Then I lost everything. You just talk, nothing else. Whatever I earn with my hard work, you gamble away. You talk about money all the time. You spoil my mood. You keep lecturing me. This is my home, not your school. Don't talk to me as though you are my teacher. I command so much respect outside. She doesn't understand my talent. You're a curse to my life. I would have gone places if it wasn't for you. Ms Damini, make sure you bring Mr. Shekhar along. There's our programme next week in the colony. "Oh traveller.." Damini.. Love is a blessing which only the fortunate receive. You have received it. Don't reject it. Shekhar treats you so nicely. And you walked out on him. Is there anything greater than love? (Knock On Door) You? Sister! - Please come. Hello. - Hello. When did you come from Delhi? - Day before yesterday. I'll be going to the market. Please be seated. - I'm fine. (Baby Crying) How about a soft-drink? - No, thank you. Please be seated. Shall I make you a cup of tea? You haven't done the right thing. Leaving home like this and speaking against my family.. All this.. I didn't say anything against anybody. I just spoke the truth. - To hell with your truth! The police.. the press.. They pretend to be sympathetic. They are not concerned with the truth. They are not concerned about Urmi. They are merely using you. That's it! They want to make you into an instrument that harms us. It's just politics. Why don't you understand? You're being victimised by their conspiracy. Everybody is playing this game for his own selfish gains. I don't understand this game. I just want justice for Urmi. What justice? Justice from whom? Nothing is going to happen. The damage is not irreparable. Forget everything. Return home with me for my sake? I'll speak to my parents. Don't be hurt by their reaction. Moreover, you living here alone? I don't like it. I'm not happy living away from you. But.. - But what? The same madness again? All that talk of conscience? The sad part is that.. ..there are more important things for you than me. And my life.. No! If Urmi goes to court, all of us will be behind bars. What for? Urmi can't even walk properly. The man from court, who has gone to the hospital.. ..to record Urmi's statement has been won over by my dad. As for Damini, Chaddha is bound to exploit her in the court. My dad said the same thing. Don't worry. Damini's truth doesn't hold water. Those who have money can do anything. Anything. Anything? - Yes. Then how about doing it once again! Rascal! The story narrated by this girl Damini.. ..whether there is truth in what she says or not.. ..that'll be decided later. I say that no such incident took place in Gupta's home. Urmi is an immoral girl. - This is a lie. Urmi isn't immoral. She's a very decent, honest and hard-working girl. Silence! - But how can you wrongly.. Silence! I'm speaking. That girl is a thief, immoral and a crook. Seven days before the incident, she was caught stealing.. ..and she was thrown out of the house. Thereafter, if she was raped, or was making merry with her friends.. ..what does the Gupta family have got to do with it? Four people raped Urmi in that very house. The charge-sheet, the police investigation report.. ..and medical certificates all are in her favour. So I wish that.. - You wish a lot, Mr. Saxena. This is a court, not a shrine where wishes are fulfilled. Solid evidences and eye-witnesses are presented here. I've exposed several half truths in this very court. You too have seen that. Ms. Damini, was she wearing clothes at that time? I have already said earlier that she was raped. Is this question necessary? That's why I'm asking! Was she wearing clothes at that time or not? When I saw her the first time, at that time.. Speak loudly. I can't hear. What did you see? When I saw her the first time, she was dressed. They were taking her away. And when I reached there along with my husband.. Was she nude? Yes. Speak up. - There was a sari but.. Speak loudly. I can't hear. - No. The sari was there, but it was only draped around her. So the girl was half-nude. Now tell me, what were those four boys doing? I think.. - Don't think. Say with certainty. It's a matter of the destinies of four young people. Say with certainty. Two of the boys were close to her head. Where were their hands? On her chest or her shoulders? Two boys had grabbed her by the arms.. What was the third boy doing? - He was near her feet. Speak loudly. I can't hear. I have already told you. One boy was sitting near her feet. He had grabbed her feet. Look at me when you talk to me. Don't look down. Was he holding her feet or her thighs? Do you know what thighs are? The area upwards from the knees are known as thighs. Was he holding the feet or the thighs? Thighs. - I see. And what was the fourth boy doing? The fourth boy.. He was lying near Urmi. Was he lying near her, or above.. Shut up! Now tell me, if I present some boys before you.. ..will you be able to recognise.. ..the faces of those four boys from among them? - Yes. I would like to call some boys to the court. With your permission. - Permission granted. Come in, boys! But there were only four boys that day! You'll have to identify the four from among them. That was a Holi Day and their faces were covered with colour. Come, identify them. - All right. Come and look at them closely. Don't be afraid. Look carefully. Was he the one? No? Was he the one? Look closely. Don't be scared. Is he the one? Keep him away. I'm looking. Recognise them! Is he the one? Their faces were not covered.. ..with so much colour that day. - Faces are coloured like this only. Recognise him. Is he the one? Ask him to keep a distance. He's trying to mislead me. Is he the one? - This.. Wrong! He's a constable. But I didn't say that.. - It doesn't matter. One can make mistakes. Look at him. Is he the one? Was he holding her arms? - Keep them away. Was he holding her feet? - Keep them away. Was he holding her thighs? - Keep them away! Keep them away! Keep them away. Go out. What are you trying to prove, Mr. Chaddha? I want to prove that this girl is mad. - What? She loses her mental balance when she sees colours. No, no.. it's nothing of the sort. - She begins to concoct stories. It's a lie. - She starts behaving abnormally. Father, what.. She screams. - What are you saying? - Silence! No! - Objection, milord. Mr. Chaddha is trying to complicate the case. I would like to present some more witnesses. One day, I noticed that she was babbling. She was talking to herself. I don't know what she was saying. She resembled a mad person. One day I got her a beautiful dress. It was such a colourful dress. But she tore the dress to pieces. One day, I had brought her rainbow-coloured threads. She looked at the coloured threads as if they were snakes. She began abusing me. She's a fool! They are lying to protect their family's honour. I'll present a witness who doesn't belong to the Gupta family. Damini's father, Mr. Chandrakant! Swear that you will speak the truth. - Yes. Is it true that your daughter Damini is.. ..mentally challenged? - No. What did you say? - Yes. She was eight years old when.. ..she was playing Holi with her friends on the roof. While playing, she fell from the roof and became unconscious. What? - She was unconscious for three hours. When she regained consciousness.. - Father. ..she began to behave awkwardly. She began babbling. Ever since then, we keep her away from colours. She began imagining strange things, concocted stories. Point to be noted, milord. But Damini is a very good daughter. She looks after the house well. - All right, you may go. Milord.. - Judge.. She's a very good daughter. May every parent get a daughter like her. She would never want anybody's loss. All right. You may go. Father.. (Crying) Damini is insane. Gupta's enemies, his business rivals, took advantage of this.. ..to bring disrepute to the Gupta family. I would like the allegations on the four boys to be withdrawn.. ..and Damini to be sent to a good mental hospital for treatment. That's all, Your Honour. After hearing the testimony of the witnesses.. ..the court hereby concludes that Damini should be kept under.. ..medical observation at the mental hospital for two weeks. The next date for hearing of the case.. ..will be determined after receiving the doctor's report. You have made a joke out of Damini. Chaddha had said that he'll wind up the case today itself. I didn't come to the court because you said so. And now you say she has been sent to the mental asylum? Why are you being so cruel to Damini? What's her sin? Dad, Damini is my wife. She's your daughter-in-law.. Go and bring her. And send us all to jail. Destroy this family's honour. Do as you like. When you talked of marriage.. ..neither did we consider the home nor their status. We just saw your love, and made her our daughter-in-law. Today she's bent on ruining the family name. And we should stand and watch the fun? But Damini too.. Now look.. This fight isn't meant to harm Damini.. ..but to protect the honour of this family. It's a matter of a few days. Once the report arrives.. Her mental condition isn't right. Whatever she said didn't happen. And the case will be closed. Bring her back. I'll accompany you to bring her back. Happy? I'm your father. I know you well. I won't let any thing happen to you. Can I meet Damini? It's not right for you to meet her for a few days. Why? The police, the press, everyone is focussing on this case. Oh, God. - The case might get complicated further. It's a matter of a few days. Everything will be fine. You had said that the case will be closed if I lie in the court. So I said just what you asked me to. Now bring my daughter back to your home as soon as possible. She's in the mental asylum. - Don't worry. She'll come back very soon. She'll come back home soon. Mr. Bajaj! Please come! You may go. Didn't I tell you that she'll come back? - Okay. Please be seated, Mr. Bajaj. Mr. Gupta, Mr. Bajaj.. now forget whatever is the past. Damini will definitely not return. Consider your own interests now and form relationships. Become in-laws. I wish my daughter to be married into his family. Because of Shekhar's insistence, I had to agree to his marriage. Otherwise, none of us were happy about it. I didn't even like the name. Damini means lightening. She fell like lightening and separated the two of them. Fireflies, which are like lightening.. ..can be found in abundance in my backyard. Go and arrange for some champagne. I'll be right back. I agree to whatever Mr. Chaddha says. Dad will come.. mom will come.. ..sister will come.. Then all of us will go far.. ..holding the hair. In a train.. She's turning it. Look, she's turning it. Shut up! Otherwise I'll beat you! She'll beat me. I'll tell mom. She'll come and beat everybody. Everyone hits me. I'll tell sister too. She too will come and beat everybody. I'll tell them everything. (Drums Playing) (Tabla Playing) Why hasn't Damini been made insane by now? By giving her too many shocks, her nerves in the brain might rupture. She might die too. - She might die? Have such death cases happened before? We take all precautions. But a couple of patients have committed suicide. Then Damini too can commit suicide! - What? I mean.. She can die accidentally. Doctor.. - Yes? Damini isn't in her room. - What? Yes. - Come. We always take complete care. But I don't know how.. Is this a hospital or what? You'll have to pay a heavy price, ma'am! Rakesh.. - Yes? - I checked in the grounds, in the kitchen. But she's not to be seen. Hey! Hey! Listen. Hey! Hey! Stop! (Laughing) Leave me. Listen.. Excuse me, doctor. - Yes? Dad is on the line. Mr. Chaddha too wants to speak to you. It's very, very urgent. Shall we go? Let's go. Ram Singh! - Yes, sir? A girl has escaped. Let's look for her. Hurry up. There she is. Over there! - Catch her. Quick! Open the door. Save me! Save me! Save me! You drunkard! Leave the girl! Didn't you hear? Move back. Leave the girl! Peter.. (Thunder Rumbling) Looks like it's going to rain. My home is close by. If you wish, you can stay for a while. I will leave you home. Here, have a cup of tea. It'll be good for you. I'll arrange for an autorickshaw. Are you a lawyer? - I was a lawyer once. Who were these people who were chasing you? My name is Damini. Is this the place? - Yes. That drunkard had taken her away from this place. Forget it, Damini. Forget about the courts. You won't get anything. Wouldn't I get justice? - Justice? I have seen what justice is. I have even experienced it. Truth.. the voice of the soul. All that is nonsense! Those who depend on it only get suffering. My wife Aarti.. she too had ideals like you. She too talked like you do. She wanted me to become a barrister.. ..that I fight for truth and justice. Once when she was buying something from the market.. ..an affluent drunk crushed her under his car and sped off. What's more, Damini.. ..I couldn't even get justice for her. They were the same people. The same Chaddha, the same courts, the same things. Witnesses were bought over, witnesses were manipulated. People compromise with their conscience for peanuts. If there's a law to prevent crime, there are ten ways to break it. And in the middle of it all, what justice can one get? And I.. like a fool.. ..made the rounds of courts again and again. And all I got was a date! I agree time has been very unfair to you. But if people like you.. ..give up hope, who will fight for people like us? I have stopped attending courts. Not for my sake or Urmi's sake, but for your wife Aarti's sake.. Don't take her name. - I'm reminding you. She wanted to make you a barrister so that.. ..you could ensure justice for the poor and weak people. I'm dead for this world. Do you mean that a girl.. ..her life, her honour.. ..has no meaning for you? It has no meaning. All right. Then forget everything. Drown yourself in your liquor. Aarti's soul will feel very peaceful. Damini! A court which ridiculed my Aarti's death.. ..I'll never go to such a court. Never! You had told me that the letter has already been dispatched. But the letter is still here? - Sir, I thought that.. What did you think? You thought that you would get away with lying. Why are you scared of speaking the truth? It's a small thing. - It's not a small thing, Dilip. Why do men lie? Why are men afraid of speaking the truth? Why? Everybody is lying. Everybody.. I..I just hope everything is okay with Damini. Everything be well.. No. I won't open it. Damini has to be taken to the mental asylum. I won't let you take her there. They are driving her insane. It's a court order. How can she not go? No, my husband isn't at home. I can't open the door. Break the door. - Yes, sir. Run away, Damini. Jump out of the window and run away. Run! She escaped from the window. Chase her. Enough is enough. Come along willingly, or I'll have to use force. How wonderful, Kadam! You have shown a lot of alertness. So you've finally been promoted! The department has given you the responsibility of.. ..using force against women, has it? Have you forgotten the law just because you've stopped practicing it? I have an arrest warrant in this girl's name. I too have a legal document. A stay order. Damini won't go anywhere till the next date of hearing. Try and come up with another scheme.. ..with the people whom you're dealing with. I won't spare you, Govind. Whenever, wherever.. Send a constable. I'll deal with him. Move carefully, Kadam. The case is very slippery. If you slip, you'll keep on tumbling. No, Damini. You won't weep now. Those people will weep. No! Those people.. We are ruined. We have had it. There are only two ways now. If we are saved, we'll go back to Jaunpur. Otherwise, to the mental asylum. Have you gone mad or what? I'm not the only one who has gone mad. All of us have gone mad. He's the one, Mr. Chaddha, who used to say that fireflies.. ..which are like lightening, can be found in abundance in his backyard. Now has lightening struck you down. He was going to make Damini insane! Learn to stay within your limits. That drunkard Govind will rescue her? The last time, I entangled him in such a manner.. ..that he had forgotten his way to court. The same thing will happen this time too. I'll press such a nerve that they'll scream. Urmi! How has this happened? Grandfather, how.. (Crying) What has she done? She was so happy just yesterday. She was saying that she'll return to the village. Mr. Govind.. this Urmi.. She was going to be operated tomorrow. Urmi couldn't bear the pain. She committed suicide. Urmi wouldn't commit suicide. It's a lie. What lie? Everything is the truth. Here's the letter which was found in Urmi's hand. And we have just filed a report. Damini.. ..read Mr. Kadam's truth. 'I can't bear the pain any longer.' 'The suffering is increasing.' 'I am committing suicide of my own accord.' This is a lie. This isn't Urmi's letter. That poor girl didn't even know how to write. What nonsense! This letter was found in her hand. You're speaking nonsense! Nonsense! This truth was found in Urmi's hand. In her hands. And her hands are smeared with blood. And there's not even a drop of blood on your truth. Many questions will be raised in court. And I'll make you write such a letter. In the court. - Govind! You're accusing a responsible police officer! Do you realise the meaning of meddling with the police, don't you? I'm aware of the police as well as what happens at your police station.. ..where many brave policemen tie up an innocent man.. ..and display their strength by thrashing him. Kadam, have you ever gone to a zoo? What? - A zoo! Even children throw peanuts at caged lions. That's something different. If you confront a lion out in the open.. ..the wrong impression you have of being a man will be cleared. Govind! - Don't scream! Save your heavy voice for the court. You have to give many answers there. Listen.. ..tell Chaddha that Govind is coming back to the courts again. (Thunder Rumbling) Instead of meddling with me in the courts.. ..it would be better to settle the matter out-of-court. You know that Inderjeet Chaddha.. ..is never defeated. Have you ever seen children removing kites from the electric wires? What? Even children remove entangled kites from some wires. That's a different matter. But the wire which you've touched by taking up Damini's case.. ..you'll get such a shock that you won't even be able to shake. The rope has been burnt, but the strength remains. Gupta is willing to pay Rs.400,000. For one girl's honour, this is quite a sum. You have made considerable progress, Chaddha. You have come from dealing in law to auctioning honour? Such a profession is known as pimping. - Govind! Don't scream! Otherwise I'll close this case here itself. No dates, no hearing. Justice. That too right away! Tell him, Chaddha. Such toys are sold aplenty in the market. But the heart required to play with it.. ..is not available in any market. A man is born with it. And when this 5-pound arm hits somebody.. ..a man doesn't wake up. He just goes up there! I'll give you the reply tomorrow in the court. And remember.. if you misbehave in the court in any manner.. ..I'll beat you right there. The judge will keep on screaming 'Order, order'.. ..and you'll continue to be beaten up. Relax.. (Thunder Rumbling) Damini's a very clever and cunning girl. She has certainly been born in a poor family. But she always dreamt of affluence. So she lured a decent boy like Shekhar with her beauty. Actually, she had been eyeing Mr. Gupta's wealth. And when despite her best efforts.. ..she couldn't lay her hands on the wealth.. ..she was filled with fury. She decided to seek revenge from.. ..the family which didn't allow her dreams to be fulfilled.. Taking advantage of this fact, the Gupta family's enemies.. ..bought her off by paying her money. They hatched a big conspiracy. The rape which happened in the market.. ..they tried to prove that the rape happened in Mr. Gupta's home.. ..so that the Gupta family's good name could be ruined forever. Such a lowly, cunning girl should be punished most severely.. ..so that womankind learn a lesson from this. That's all, Your Honour. Your Honour, Mr. Chaddha has somewhat confused me. Looks like he sees too many Hindi movies. Because this case is like a Hindi movie.. ..in which many stories are entangled. During the last hearing, Mr. Chaddha had said that Damini is insane. Today, he says that Damini is cunning. So cunning that she can scheme, conspire, plan. I think that a girl who is insane can't be cunning. And if she is so cunning, then she can't be insane. So I would like that Mr. Chaddha be sent.. ..to a mental asylum at government expense just like Damini. Just for a few days. So that when he comes back after treatment.. ..he can tell us clearly whether Damini is insane or cunning. I'll prepare my defence accordingly. That's all, milord. (Laughing) Milord, I have already proved that Damini is a lowly woman. The people that are lowly are those who raped a girl.. ..a girl who had grown up in their own home! The people that are lowly are those who arranged a girl to be murdered.. ..a girl who is lying helpless in a hospital. That girl wasn't raped in Gupta's home.. and neither has she been murdered. She has committed suicide and I have already presented my witnesses. And I would like to question those very witnesses, milord. Permission granted. You've been working for Mr. Gupta since 10 years. - Yes, sir. It means that you're loyal to him. - Yes. Dutiful. They trust you completely. You take complete care of the cars? - Yes. Like their repairing, filling the petrol.. - It's all my responsibility. So, on Holi, when those four boys took Urmi away.. - Yes. - Then.. Pay attention, Mr. Chaddha. So, on that day, when the four boys took Urmi away.. ..they must have been very worried. They must have searched for you, for the car.. for the keys? No, sir. I don't keep the keys of the Gypsy. How do you know that they went in a Gypsy? No, sir. I got to know later, sir. You mean you got to know later that the rape took place. Point to be noted, Milord. All right, Mangesh. You may go. Okay. - Bloody fool. - Mangesh.. - Yes? Mr. Chaddha, do you wish to scold Mangesh? What? You were mumbling. So I thought maybe you want to ask him something. No. - So, Mr. Kadam.. Urmi couldn't have cut her throat with the letter in her hand.. ..nor could she write a letter after cutting her throat. So, it means that somebody else kept the letter there. Actually.. ar.. ch.. pa.. Mr. Chaddha, do you understand his language? As it is, you don't hear very well! The most important thing is that Urmi didn't know how to write. Her ration card bears her thumb impression, not her signature. And Urmi's killers perhaps didn't know about this. Just like Mr. Kadam and Mr. Chaddha don't know. Am I wrong, Mr. Chaddha? I would like your permission to call Shekhar Gupta, Damini's husband. You have permission. Swear that you will speak the truth. - I will speak the truth. Mr. Shekhar, do you love your wife? I don't want to answer such an absurd question. How strange! I asked a very simple question. Whether a husband loves his wife or not. What say, Mr. Chaddha? Did I ask anything wrong? No? So tell me, do you love her or not? - I do. What did you say? Did you hear, Mr. Chaddha? No, he didn't. Mr. Chaddha and I are hard of hearing. Please, speak louder. I love her. Don't lower your eyes. Look into your wife's eyes and say whether you love her or not. It's a matter of a woman's trust. I love her a lot. Mr. Shekhar loves his wife very much. I heard it. Mr. Chaddha heard it, too. Everybody heard it. I though you could have said the same thing with a smile. Mr. Shekhar.. I'm shocked that you love a woman.. ..who is ill-natured, who is insane.. You love a woman who insults your parents. You love a woman who caused havoc in your family's peace. A woman who doesn't loves you, but your wealth. A woman who is bringing disrepute to the Gupta family. What nonsense are you talking? You're talking rubbish. I'm not saying this. This is what has been alleged by your lawyer and your family members. I'm not saying anything wrong, am I? Anyway, I know that these people are lying. Mr. Shekhar, on that Holi day.. ..when your frightened wife came and took you to the terrace.. ..where you saw Urmi being raped.. Pay attention, Mr. Chaddha. What did you do then? Nothing of the sort happened. - What? It means Damini is lying. - I didn't say that. What did you say? Damini says that a rape took place. You say it didn't. So Damini is lying. Why is she lying? Why is she.. I'm saying nothing of the sort happened. It means that Damini is insane. - Absolutely not. Mr. Chaddha, I'm sorry. You're right. Damini is a lowly woman. She is a immoral woman who sold out for money. - Stop this nonsense! I am talking sense. - Stop it, stop it! Mr. Govind, please come here. You have no right to speak to my husband like this. Whether he testifies in my favour or not, it's his decision. But don't embarrass him like this in the court. Let him go. - What do you think you are? What? - Am I your servant? Your slave? Have you bought me over? I wouldn't let a lowly woman like you come anywhere near me.. - Govind! If you speak any other word against my wife.. (Whistles) Sorry, Damini. Did you see, Milord? When I say anything to the husband, the wife feels bad. When I say anything to the wife, the husband screams. This proves that there's a deep love between them.. ..which is as firm as a rock despite such a delicate situation. Despite the fact that Damini accused Shekhar's brother of rape. Despite the fact that Damini dragged the Gupta family to the courts. Still Shekhar can't bear to hear a word against Damini. Because he knows beyond any doubt that.. ..whatever Damini is doing is the right thing. That she's speaking the truth. Now I would like to hear that truth from Mr. Shekhar himself. Mr. Shekhar, I won't ask you any further question. I'm leaving this case. Because Damini doesn't need me, but you. She is your wife. You mean everything to her. So you have to make a decision. Whether you'll let your innocent wife be punished.. ..to save those four criminals.. You have to make that decision. I don't understand anything. What is he trying to accomplish by proving that true love.. ..exists between a husband and wife? He should feel ashamed that.. ..he's taking the assistance of a woman's fake emotions. Shut up, you law-pimping scoundrel! Shut up, you two-bit nobody! Order, order, order. Milord, my health has deteriorated all of a sudden. I request the court.. ..to give another date. Because of Mr. Chaddha's health being deteriorated.. ..the date of the next hearing will be determined later. Now this fight is no longer restricted between Damini and us. On one side are those people.. ..who have been tolerating atrocities since ages. And on the other side are us. Damini has managed a tremendous support from the common man. And now there's only one way out. Just like Urmi's murder was made out to be a suicide.. ..similarly Damini's death should be made a road accident. The torch of truth that she's going around with.. ..that torch will have to be extinguished with her blood. It's nice. A woman whose conscience you couldn't buy.. ..whose goodness you couldn't fight against.. ..whose faith you couldn't break.. ..by deciding to give her death.. ..you're giving ample proof of being true men. Stop this nonsense! People are ridiculing us all over the city. People are abusing us on the streets. You know, don't you? There's only way now to save our honour. Honour? What honour are you talking of? A man in whose house an innocent girl has been raped.. ..he's talking of honour? A man who got a helpless, weak girl murdered in the hospital.. ..he's talking of honour? A man who can think of getting his daughter-in-law killed.. ..he's talking of honour? Where is the honour? Where is the honour? Instead, it's better for a person to die of shame. How many more crimes will you commit to hide one crime? You don't realise to what extent you have fallen, Dad! Today I'm proud that I'm Damini's husband. But I will have to say with shame that I'm Kedarnath Gupta's son. Don't touch me! Don't touch me! You'll speak like this to your father? - Enough is enough. I feel like suffocating you to death right now! But I can't kill anybody. And I regret it. And yes! I'm going to side with Damini. Do whatever you like. Damini will emerge victorious. (Tires Screeching) That's our Shekhar. - Yes. Where are you going? We'll miss the train. Go on. - At such times, even a stray dog of one's street proves his loyalty. He's our own Shekhar! Follow them, driver! Tinu, nobody should know that Damini is in your home. - All right. Bring Damini tomorrow to the court carefully through the back lanes. It's possible that I might be assaulted. But it's very necessary that Damini reaches court tomorrow. Don't worry. She's like my sister. Govind was saved. Damini shouldn't reach the courts tomorrow. I'll prevent her. I'll take the next date. And before the next date.. (Laughing) Damini is a very clever and intelligent girl. By now, she has realised that very soon she's going to be exposed. She has run away. Now only the police can arrest and bring her. One should wait for such a day, and a next date of hearing be given. I'm fully convinced that somebody is preventing Damini from coming here. But I'm confident that she'll surely come. Because many are banking upon her, and she has our prayers. She'll surely come. Hurry up. Go Yadav. (Tires Screeching) This is the height of waiting. Now you should give the next date for hearing. Before you determine the next date, I would like to say something. You have permission. In the first hearing, it was said that Damini is insane. She was sent away to the mental asylum.. ..where a full attempt was made to make her insane. Before the second hearing.. ..Urmi was murdered at the hospital.. ..and the case was registered as a suicide.. ..whereas I established in the court that.. ..Urmi didn't commit suicide. ..that she has been murdered. And Mr. Shekhar too was about to speak out the truth.. ..when Mr. Chaddha played another trick. He feigned sickness and took a next date of hearing. Otherwise, a decision about this case would've come about that day. And today, you're again giving a next date for hearing. And before that date, some truck will run me down.. ..and the case will be registered as an accident. You'll give yet another date. And before that date, Damini will be made insane and dumped.. ..into a mental asylum. Thus, neither will there be anybody to fight for truth.. ..nor to seek justice. All that will remain is a date for hearing. And this is what has been happening. Dates after dates for hearings have been given.. ..but justice has not been meted out. Only the dates have been given. The agents of law have used these dates for hearings.. ..as a weapon against justice. These people trade in law outside the courts.. ..between two dates of hearings. Witnesses are bought over, witnesses are manipulated and killed. All that remains are dates of hearings. For the sake of justice, people sell off their land.. ..and property to fight cases in courts. But all that remains are dates of hearings. Even women have sold off their ornaments for the sake of justice. And all that they have got is a date of hearing. Months and years pass by visiting the courts.. ..and many applicants become history themselves. And all they get is a date. This case is about the weak and oppressed people of India. Today their entire attention is focussed on you. What do you give them? Justice or a date for hearing? If you can't give them justice, then stop this farce.. ..pull out these witness boxes, tear up the books of law.. ..so that more people are not ruined in their pursuit of justice. (Crowd Applauding) Milord, what is going on? This is contempt of court. It is contempt of court Punish him.. now, right away. Order, order. Mr. Chaddha, the court will decide who should be punished and who shouldn't. Order, order. Until this court reaches some decision.. ..the hearing won't be postponed. Come on! Come forward! Come forward! Show your manliness! Show me! Move forward! Touch me. Come on! Move forward! Why are you moving back? Move forward. Touch me. Come on! Come on! I can say with certainty that Damini won't come back. Damini won't come back. - Damini has come! Damini has come! Damini has come! Damini has come! You're all right, I hope. They were trying to kill me. I have come here safely with great difficulty. I had guessed it right. They tried to kill Damini. Now the court can understand who stands to gain with Damini's death. Why would Gupta and Bajaj do any such thing? Point to be noted, milord. I didn't take anybody's name. By taking Mr. Bajaj's name, Mr. Chaddha has proved that.. ..Bajaj too is associated with the Gupta family in this conspiracy. (Crowd Applauding) Order, order. Milord, I now seek permission to call Mr. Shekhar Gupta. A man whose wife is such a mad woman.. ..how can he show his face to anyone? The poor man has run away. - It's impossible. Shekhar can't go anywhere leaving Damini in such a state. I think that either he has been forcibly locked up somewhere.. ..or to protect the false honour of the Gupta family.. ..he could even have been eliminated. What nonsense are you talking? - I'm speaking right. It's impossible. No father can kill his own son. - Why not? Those who can attack their daughter-in-law.. ..who can consider her nothing more than a sacrificial lamb.. No. I don't want justice. Calm down, Damini. Truth will emerge victorious. We will get justice. - What truth? What justice? I don't want anything. - Damini.. Let me speak, Mr. Govind. I have seen a lot. I have heard a lot. These people have made a business out of Urmi's rape. They have made it their livelihood. The press has sold Urmi's devastation in instalments.. ..in the form of juicy stories. The police has made her ruin a medium of amassing money. And a doctor, who is considered another form of God.. ..he ran away after accepting money.. ..leaving Urmi behind to die. These people are worse than vultures. They feed on living human beings. All of them are fakes and frauds. They adorn the idol of the Goddess in the temple with silk clothes.. ..while outside they remove women's clothes. Undress them. I don't want to prove the truth among such people. Just because I witnessed Urmi's rape once.. ..just because I set about to get her justice.. She was raped at every nook and corner. Sometimes at the police station, at other times in these courts. She was raped repeatedly. She was raped every time. Where were the hands? Where were the hands? Where were the hands? On the arm, or on the shoulders? On the waist, or on the thighs? How nude was she? These questions were important. But in what manner were these questions posed to me? And when such ghastly questions were being posed to me.. ..why didn't anybody raise a voice of protest? Where were those brothers.. ..who wear rakhis and set out to protect their sisters? Why are everybody's eyes lowered today? Why? That day, everybody had their eyes focussed on me.. ..when Mr. Chaddha was going about insulting me. What do you say, Mr. Chaddha? The portion above the knees is known as thighs. I too know that. Now I ask you. Answer me, Mr. Chaddha. The area under the neck is known as the chest, isn't it? You're short of hearing. So I will scream and say so that you can hear clearly. The area under the neck is known as the chest. A person's first identity is determined by this part of the body. Every mother feeds milk by placing the child onto her breast. You too must have drunk your mother's milk like that. Would you have questioned your mother or sister.. ..the way you questioned me? Answer me, Mr. Chaddha. Look into my eyes and answer me. (Crying) No.. I don't want truth. At least let Urmi's soul rest in peace. I'm withdrawing this case. Perhaps I was mad that till today I was.. I am mad. Send me back to the mental asylum. Perhaps that's the right place for me. I am fit to be there. Forgive me, Shekhar. Damini! I'm a culprit. I'm an offender. It's true that Urmi was raped. I saw it. In my house. My brother and his friends raped Urmi. This fact was concealed by me and my family members. So that our honour isn't tainted. So that our false honour isn't tainted. It's also true that Urmi was murdered. Mr. Chaddha, Mr. Bajaj.. ..and my father are involved in this conspiracy. If I have been able to gather the courage to reach here.. ..despite such embarrassing circumstances.. If I have been able to reach here despite fighting death.. ..the strength for that is standing in front of me. It's Damini, my wife. I'm proud.. ..that Damini is my wife. And I'm proud that I'm her husband. (Crowd Applauding) Order, order. After hearing all the witnesses and Shekhar's testimony.. ..Rakesh and his three friends Mahesh Kadia, Anup Arya and.. ..Bharat Sabhrawal are hereby sentenced to.. ..seven years imprisonment for committing the crime of rape.. ..and all those family members of the Gupta family.. ..who tried to cover up this crime.. ..are hereby sentenced to two years imprisonment. Inderjeet Chaddha, Kedarnath Gupta, and Tolu Bajaj.. ..are hereby sentenced to seven years imprisonment.. ..for conspiring to murder Urmi. No action will be taken against Shekhar Gupta.. ..who helped this court mete out justice. (Crowd Applauding) Order, order. Neither I nor this court deserve this applause. I ask those who have a grievance against the court. Who does justice? It's your own conscience that metes out the greatest justice. And there's no greater court than the conscience. It's Damini who has proved this statement of Gandhiji to be true. The law and the court are grateful to Damini. In the history of law this day.. ..and judgement will be known as Damini's judgement. In honour of Damini.. ..let us all congratulate Damini.. ..with the sound of our clapping hands. (Crowd Applauding) Congratulation to you. (Camera Clicks) "Damini, Damini, my Damini." "Damini, Damini, my Damini." "Damini.. Damini.. Damini is yours." "Damini.. Damini.. Damini is yours." "Damini, Damini, my Damini." "Damini.. Damini.. Damini is yours."
