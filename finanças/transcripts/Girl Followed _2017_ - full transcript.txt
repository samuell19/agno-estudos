This neighborhood isn't safe to walk in. Hop in. I'll give you a ride. Get over here. - Tara No, no! - Get in there. - Okay. - One more time. - Shale, I noticed you have some sores in your mouth. Do they hurt? - A little. - How long have they been there? - I guess, like, a couple weeks. - I need you to be honest with me so we can give you the proper care. Shale. Are you sexually active? - No. - Have you engaged in any oral sex? - I said no. - I have to ask, okay. I'll take your pulse. - Just confirming Joey's ten o'clock tomorrow to have a cast removed. Does that still work? Great. Thanks. Can I help you? - I'm just waiting for my mom. Abby. - You're nurse Abby's daughter. - Mhm. - Now tell me, are you the one that plays soccer or wants to be a fashion designer? Obviously, right? I'm Nate. I just started about two weeks ago. - I know. I think you were at lunch the last time I came in. - Well, let me let your mom know that you're here. - She knows. I texted her. - So. What else are you into besides fashion? - Um, I like dogs. Even though my parents won't let me get one. And I don't know, I watch TV. - What's your favorite TV show? - Right now it's that dating show, Single Swap. - Mine too. - How is Shale? - I found some lesions in her mouth. It might be an STD. - I was really hoping to get through this month without having to tell another family that news. - I know. I don't envy you. - No, I don't either. - Good luck sweetheart. - Thank you. - So do you think Greg actually hooked up with Linda or did Paul just kinda start that to make drama? - I think it was a complete lie. What do you think? - I don't know. I mean, Linda was into Greg the minute she arrived at the house. - That's true. - Hi sweetie. How was school? - Same as usual. Lame. - I see you met Nate, - Yeah, we were actually just talking about our favorite reality show. - Guys, guys, that stuff is going to rot your brain. - She's so out of touch. - Honey, why don't you go to the break room and do your homework? 'Cause your dad's going to be here in about a half hour to pick you up and take you to the party store. - Do I have to? - No, but look, your sister really wants your help picking out stuff for her party so you kinda need to. Sorry kiddo. - Abby! Hey! I almost forgot you actually work here. - Hey Diane. Good to see you. Honey, break room! - Fine. - Thank you. - Is Shale almost done? My new dining room set's getting delivered today. You know how it is, juggling all the crazy schedules. - Dr. Blockman's actually with her now. I'll go see how much longer it'll be. - You are a lifesaver! - Yeah, no worries. Regan Lindstrom. - Are you serious? - Yeah. - No way. Hey, my Dad's here. Catch you guys later. - See ya. K, bye. - Hey sweetie. How was school today? - Great. Pop quiz in chemistry, totally nailed it. - That's my girl. Ready to go do some birthday shopping? - What do you think? - Let's do it. Let's do it! - My god you have to see what Austin just sent me. - Austin messaged you? - You're going to like it. Just sent it. It's so hot, right? - So, are you going to show him, yours? - If he's lucky. I'll just use Gem. The messages disappear, so no one will ever know. My mom has this weird party charity thing on Friday night and Shale's throwing a party. You coming? - My parents will never let me if your mom isn't home. - So? Lie. Austin's coming. - Hey. Got a minute? - Sure. Hey, I gotta go, I'll talk to you later, okay? - Peace out, beatch. - Hey, so I would've sent this to you but I don't have your contact. Here is all the dirt on Greg. - Where did you find this? - The show's website posts these little articles online but they only keep it on for a couple of days. They do 'em for all the characters on the show. - That's so cool. I can't believe I didn't know about this. - Yeah, I can send you the link. - Yeah, here. I'll give you my e-mail - Are you on GEM? 'Cause I can text you. - Yeah, here. Just type in my name and I'll accept your invite. - Okay, found you already. - N-Dog? - Yeah, it's my nickname. Sounds pretty thug, right? - You're hilarious. - So, what are you working on? - Rational equations. Super boring. - Well you know, I used to be pretty good at those. If you ever need any help, call me. - Okay N-Dog. - Excuse me. Um, I not really feeling that well, can I see a Doctor please. - Hi, my love! - Hey. - So, what's the good news? - I'm gonna tell you tonight at dinner. - Come on! You promised you'd tell me when you got here. - I know, but this way, I can let the anxiety grow for a few more hours. - Unbelievable, you are. You always do this to me. - It's what you love about me though. - Very true. - Yeah. - Okay, Im gonna go grab Regan. - Okay. - Hey I'm Nate. - Nice to meet you, Jim. Hey Diane. - So, are you in the medical field as well? - No, no. I'm actually the Youth Program Director at the YACC. - Yeah, okay cool. I know where that is. So you work with kids all day too? Just like your wife? - Yes. Yes, we do have that in common. Plus when one of the kids gets hurt playing sports on one of the fields, I can just send 'em over to her. There she is. - Hi Dad. - Hey, you ready to go? Taylor's in the car. - Okay - Alright sweetie. - Okay Regan, what have you been up to? - So I saw Sabine's sister coming out of the doctor's office today. - You mean Shale? She's so annoying. - No she's not! - Don't defend her just because she's Sabine's sister. I mean, all she cares about is attention. - That's not true. Boys just like her. - Yeah, because she barely wears any clothes. Like, I'm pretty sure she shops in the toddler section. - Whatever, Taylor. You're just too good for everyone. - That's enough, ladies. - She started it by dissing on Shale. - Well I'm gonna end it. Alright, we're going to go on to a new topic of conversation. - Hi love. - Hey! - Okay. I'm not waiting any more. - You wanna hear it now? Okay, um. - What's the news? - Okay, well, okay I can tell you, sure why not. Well, the good news is that you are looking at the next Senior Director at the YACC. - What? Honey! That's awesome. - It's good, right? You know Darren told me today, he said that all the other committee members are on board. So it's a done deal. - Honey, you deserve it. I'm so happy for you. - Well, it's gonna be longer hours. But, a lot better pay so, I think I'm gonna finally be able to take us on the cruise at the Bahamas. - Aww honey! You worked so hard for this. - Good, right? - That's amazing! Okay, what'd you make? - I made pasta again, yeah! Again! - Aww. So cute! Thanks. - You're welcome. What are you up to? - There's a party tomorrow night. A guy I like is going. Should I go too? - Hells yeah. Why wouldn't you? - Why wouldn't I? Because my parents never let me do anything fun. No parents home. I'm not allowed! - Lie and say you're going to a movie. Duh. - Ha! I like the way you think! Hey! - Hi! - My god, your sister is so cool. Can we please trade? - My god! Look who's coming over. - Hey Sabine. - I can't believe you came. - I can't say no to you. Especially after you sent me that photo today. - I'm glad you liked it. I want to show you my room. - I'd love to see it. - We'll be back in a bit. - Hello. - So how was the party? - Lame. He went for my best friend Sabine. - Why? - Because she sent him half-naked pictures of herself. - Well, why don't you do that? Show Sabine that she's got some competition. - I don't know. Because. I mean, what if he thinks I look stupid or something? - Pictures from a cute girl like you? I don't think so. Trust me. I'm a guy. - Hey, I gotta go. - Fine. - Bye. Come in! - Honey, are you up? - Yup. G'morning. - How ya doing? - I'm good. - Look, I know things have been all about Taylor lately, but I want you to know that I'm going to make it up to you, okay? - It's okay, mom. I get it. - Do you know how much I love you? Do you? - Get up and get dressed, okay. I'm gonna make you an amazing breakfast. - Okay. I'm getting up. - I see you. Get up. Come on! - And then Shale totally hooked up with Bobby, and then Martin got super pissed. - Hey Regan. - Hey. - You get my message? - Ummm, I don't think so. What was it? - I said red was a good color on you. Don't worry about it gorgeous. I'll hit you up later. - Okay. - What was that about? - That. - That looks like something you'd wear under gym clothes. That is so not sexy. - Well Austin liked it and that's all that matters. - Yeah, well good luck with that. He has a different girl every week. - Sabine's probably just jealous. I mean, let me see the picture. I'll let you know if it's sexy. - I don't know if I should show it to you, - Okay, whatever. Just trying to help. - Okay, but be honest. - I can see what she's saying. I mean, you look super hot in it. But guys like something more frilly and sexy. Austin is right though. You look super good in red. - Ready sweetheart? - Okay. - Bye guys. - Bye. - Okay, how bout we pick out Taylor's gift first and then look for jeans for you. - Okay - Maybe I'll look at the purses. - Yeah, I'll check out the skirts. - Is everything okay in there? Do you need any other sizes? - Yeah, no, I'm fine. - Hey honey, you ready? - Yup. - You didn't find anything that you liked? - No, I didn't see anything. - Come on. Since when do you not want something new? - I just want to go home. - Excuse me, ma'am. Is this your daughter? - Yes. - She was trying something on in the dressing room and I found these empty hangers. - They were in there when I got in there. - Did you let her into the dressing room or? - Well, no, but I mean, she was back there. - How could you possibly know that those were hers? - Well because she was the only one back there and I cleaned out the dressing room not that long ago. - Yeah, and I know my daughter and I can assure you she would never steal anything. - Okay, I'm going to have to look in that bag, miss. - How dare you accuse my daughter! You will absolutely not look in her personal things. You know what, actually, I'd like to speak to your manager. - I'm, ummm. - You know what? Forget it. We're gonna take our business elsewhere. Come on, honey. I'm so sorry. It's unbelievable! - Shut up! I can't believe you sent this photo to Austin. Okay, now where did you get this bra? It's super cute. - I stole it. - My god, no way! That is so not cool. - Well, I'm sorry I wasn't born into a rich family like you were. - Yeah. - She's lying, Mom! - I am not! Kara showed me the pictures today. Everyone at school has seen them! - Regan, honey be honest. Did you let a boy take a picture of you in your bra and panties? - What? - No! - It was a selfie, Mom! She took it herself! - Regan, Is that true? - No, I didn't do anything wrong! - Let me see your phone. - She ruined my party! - She didn't ruin your party. We're going to figure this out, okay honey. Mom and I need to talk. Can we have some privacy please? - I hate her so much! - Taylor, please! - Are you kidding me? Sending half naked pictures of herself? She's 14! - I know. Honestly, I think it's Sabine. Between you and I, her sister, came into the clinic and she has an STD. Honey, she's Taylor's age. - Wow. - Yeah. - And Regan is obsessed with everything that Sabine does. - Exactly. But, if we try to separate them, then you know what'll happen. They'll just sneak around. I mean, they're best friends. - I don't even want to go in there. I'm so embarrassed. - Honey, just ignore anybody who wants to talk about the pictures. Okay, I'll talk to Kara's mom tonight. It's gonna be fine. Regan, phone. - What? No! - Yes, I'm going to hold on to it for the day. And you get it back tonight after we sit down and go over the new rules. - New rules? That's not fair! - Regan. Phone. - I hate you and I hate Dad, and if you take my phone, I'll run away and you'll never see me again. - Don't ever threaten to run away. This was your mistake. Okay, and your father and I are going to do whatever we can to help you fix it. We are on your side, but we are still your parents, okay? And you are going to live by our rules, understand? It looks like she erased the pictures. - What about the texts that she sent out with the pictures? - Yeah, those are gone too. - Why don't you try checking the laptop? Maybe she sent something from there. - Okay, will do. And umm, I'll call the counselor that Rhonda recommended as soon as she opens, see if we can get her in their soon. - Alright. Tell me what she says, okay? - Okay, will do. - Honey, we're gonna figure this out. - I hope so. Okay, bye. Sexy selfies dot com. Learn how to take the best sexy selfie? Regan. My god. Hey, honey. - Hey, so I just got a call from the principal. Regan didn't show up for school today. - What? - Excuse me. Miss, are you okay? Is everything alright? - I don't know. - Is there anything you need, I can do or? - Maybe. Do you have a phone I could use to make a call with? - Yeah, sure, okay. Here you go. - Thank you. - Sure. - The prescription should be ready by the time you get there. Thank you. Doctor's office. This is Nate. - Nate, it's Regan. - Hey, now you know your mom's off today. - I wasn't calling for her. I was calling you. They took my phone but I have her work number memorized. - What's going on? - Everything blew up with this stupid picture thing and I ran away. - Where are you? - At a park somewhere downtown. - What's the address? I'll come pick you up. - Okay, thanks Diane. I was just, I was hoping Regan was with Sabine. - Has Regan ever run away before? - No, no. Never, but, we took her phone away because we found these pictures of her after half-naked on her phone that she sent to this boy from school. - You're kidding. - Has Sabine ever done anything like that before? - No. I've talked to my girls about how doing that type of thing can ruin their reputations. They'd never do anything like that. - You sure it wasn't a problem for you to leave work? - No, I told Dr. Blockman I wasn't feeling well. She got one of the nurses to cover the phones. - Okay well, thanks for picking me up. I didn't know where else to go. - Yeah. You can always count on me. - My gosh! This is your house? It's bigger than Sabine's! - My parents' place. I live here and I take care of it while they're gone. - Where are they? - I think Spain. Maybe Italy. Somewhere over there. Come on! - Wow! This is so cool. - Hey, what do you want to drink? I got juice, water, soda, beer, wine. This is good. Got some Hard cider. - What is it? - It's like apple juice but with a little alcohol in it. It's good. - Yeah. It is good. - You know you can't tell your parents I let you drink? Or that I brought you here. Your mom would be pissed, she'd get me fired. - I swear I won't say a thing. Plus, right now, it feels like you're the only one I can count on. - So what do you want to do? We should do something fun. - Like what? - you know how to swim? - Yeah, but I don't have a swimsuit. - It's just the two of us. Who cares? What's a matter? You're not going to come in? Come on. What am I, scaring you? - No, of course not! - Well, then come swim with me! That wasn't so bad, was it? - No. - This is so much better than work. - Or school. - Or school. - Hey! - So you saw her enter the school? hool? - She must've left right after I drove away. I went to the principal's office as soon as I got the call. Hey. - Hey. How bad is this? - I don't mean to alarm you or suggest that she's been abducted. - Abducted? - We're not going to take any chances. I'm going to issue an Amber alert. If you hear from her or she returns home, you let me know immediately. - Thanks for the ride. And for hanging out with me today. - Yeah, I was happy to do it. - Umm, can I say something weird right now? - Sure. - Do you think I'm pretty? - That's a dumb question. You're beautiful. Look, Austin's an idiot for sending those pictures. He should've treated you right. He could've been your boyfriend. Why'd you ask me that? - 'cause, I thought you were going to kiss me today in the pool but you didn't. - I wanted to. Believe me. I just wasn't sure if that's what you wanted. - Tell you what, next time, I'll kiss you, and it'll give us both something to look forward to. - Deal. - Come by the office tomorrow if you can. - Okay, I will. Bye. - Where have you been all day? - I was hanging out with a friend. - Who? - You don't know him, why? - Well my mom texted me asking if I knew where you were. Your mom called her. - She knows I ditched? - Yeah, I think I just saw her coming out of Principal Roberts' office too. - God. - I think you're in serious trouble. - Do you understand the problems you've created? They issued an Amber alert for you! - It's not my fault you guys over-reacted! People skip school all the time. I never do it! But the one time I ditch, you guys call in the Marines! - Um mhm. This is not our fault. You need to take responsibility for what happened today. - What's going on with you? This behavior? Skipping school, shoplifting, sending half-naked pictures of yourself to boys? What is happening here? I need you to explain it to me. - There's nothing to explain, okay! The pictures were a mistake. I didn't think Austin was going to show them around the school. I'm never talking to him again, okay. I didn't shoplift. Sabine bought them for me. Call her up and ask! - Where were you today? - Answer your mother, Regan. - I told you already. At the park. By myself. - Did anyone see you there? - No! Some lady with her kids for a little while. I don't know her. What is this? Law & Order? - When you lie, we have trouble believing you. - I'm not lying! I was alone all day! - We're gonna be making some changes starting tomorrow. We're gonna put a computer in the kitchen and you can do your homework down here. You can have your phone back but at the end of each day, your father or I will check your e-mails, your texts, your pictures. And if you erase anything, then you don't get your phone back. - Are you kidding me? That's not fair! - Well this is how it's going to be until we can trust you again. - What about Taylor? Is she gonna have to do homework down here too? - Taylor didn't skip school. - This is so unfair! - Lastly, we made you an appointment for you with a counselor. You'll go there once a week until she feels like you're back on track. - How could you do this to me? You never get mad at Taylor. You never treat her like this! Only me! I can't do anything right! - Hey. - Go away. - I just want to talk to you. Why'd you ditch today? Are people bugging you about those pictures? - I just hate everyone. My life sucks. - Now why do you say that? - Sabine gets new stuff all the time. Everyone likes her. She has cool parties, it's not fair. And then I finally get something that she doesn't have, Austin, and he completely betrays me by sending my pictures around. Sabine sent him pics too! Yeah, but he didn't show those to anyone. So now it looks like I'm a total slut and she did it first. - Listen, I know she's your bae but, she's really isn't that nice to you. I've seen her put you down like althe time. - Then Mom and Dad completely flipped out on me. You skip all the time and they don't do anything. - Yeah, but I've only done it a couple times and never for the entire day. What were you thinking? Is that true though that you told mom you were going to run away before you got out of the car? I mean, I not judging you, but I think you played that wrong, just a little! - Yeah. I'm an idiot. - You're not an idiot. You're pretty and smart and you're just making some bad decisions right now. So, pump the brakes. - I'm sorry people are ditching on your party. - It's all right. I mean it's only really two people who aren't going, and I never really liked them anyway! - Hey Tay? Why do you think I'm not popular like you? - I think you try too hard to act like Sabine. You'd be popular if you just acted like you. You don't have to impress people. Who you are is enough. - G'night. - 'Night, sista. Don't stay up too late. - Hi. - Hey you. I got you something, - Aww. Thank you! - Yeah, it reminded me of you. - I love it. - Hey I was thinking, I'm off on Friday. Can you ditch and come over again. - I can't. I have to chill on ditching school for a while. - That sucks. - Yeah. - Well, maybe we can chat online tonight. - Not a good idea. My computer is in the kitchen. Where it can be supervised at all times now. - What? - Yeah. - Hi Regan. - Hi. - How are you. - I'm good. - I hear you're seeing a friend of mine this afternoon. - Mhm. - Dr. Tocaro is fantastic. You'll love her. And I told her to take really good care of you because you're one of my favorite patients. - Thank you. - I'll see you later. - Who's Dr. Tocaro? - A psychologist. My mom's making me go. - Why? - She thinks I need to talk to someone. - You can just talk to me. - I know I can. But she doesn't know that. - Psychologists are expensive. - Are they? My dad has pretty good insurance through his work, so I'm pretty sure that's covering it. - Ready, sweetie? - Yeah. - Have a nice day. - You too Nate. - Dr. Patricia Tocaro, adolescent counseling. YACC. Our Staff. James Lindstrom. Youth program director. Hello James. - "Pictures are spreading all over town. "It's the daughter of your employee Jim Lindstrom. "Anonymous." - Yes, if you can adjust that one line item from the budget, I think we're gonna be good to go. Alright? Thank you, Marsha. - Hey Jimmy. - Darren. Are you Okay? - We got a problem. I just got off the phone with Paula. - Paula Quinn? From the board? - Yes. And she received something, some rather risque photos of your daughter. Did you know about these? - Yeah. My daughter, in a momentary lapse of judgement, sent these photos to a boy that she liked. How did Paula get this email? She's not in the high school system. - They were sent to her e-mail at YACC. From an e-mail address we didn't recognize. - What? - Well, she's not the only one. Tom Fisher called right after she did. They were sent to him as well. - Are you kidding me? Who's doing this? - I don't know but both Paula and Tom expressed some concern about the publicity that might follow if you're named Senior Director. I'm worried about us being involved in an investigation. This could be construed as child pornography. - Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute Darren. Back up. This is nothing more than error of judgment on the part of a 14-year-old child. That's it. Abby and I have already handled this with the school and the principal and Regan is not going to do it again. - I'm sure you have, but the problem is, we don't know who all is seeing this. - Well, clearly the person sending this is someone who knows that I work here. Maybe it's the parents of the boy who sent the photos. They're probably angry that he got in trouble for it? I don't know who's doing this. But I'm going to find out. - Look, I'm really sorry, Jim. I'll do as much damage control as I can. But make sure Regan is careful. - I'm sure the attention you received from Austin when he liked your photos made you feel good. - It did. And I liked that he wanted me more than he wanted Sabine. - Well, that makes sense. I mean, you finally had what she didn't. Regan, let me ask you a question. On a scale from one to 10, One being hideously ugly, and 10 being supermodel gorgeous, where do you think you are? - A two. - You think you're a two? - I mean, a guy that likes me says I'm beautiful but, it's a lie. - Who is this guy? - A friend. He's really nice. He gave me this key chain. - He goes to your school? - No. - How did you meet him? At Sabine's house. - Hi honey. - Hi Dad - You're home early. It went really well with Dr. Tocaro, so that's good news. - Yeah. She was really nice. It was different than what I expected. - And I got us tickets to a fashion show so that's going to be fun. - Hey Regan, I need to talk to your mom alone for a minute, okay? - Sure. - What's up? - These were sent to everybody on the board today. Darren says it could jeopardize my promotion. - Who would do this? - I'm not sure. But clearly it's someone who's trying to get me fired. - They're letting you go? - Not yet. But I don't know how it's gonna pan out and it's not over. - I don't think we should tell Regan though. I think she would feel terrible if she thought she was responsible for you not getting your promotion, you know? - I agree. Once it's up online, it could've ended up anywhere. I'm going to find out who's behind this though. That's for damn sure. - Allergies, none Medication, penicillin Hey there. Are you Tommy? - Yup. - Hi, I'm Abby. Nice to meet you. This is going to be so, so easy, okay? I promise. Okay, You ready? You're just going to feel a little pinch, all right? Awesome! You're all done! You did so good! Nicely done! Do you want a sticker? - Sure. - Good choice, high five! You did awesome. My god! Dr. Blockman, I need you now! Okay, the Dr's on her way, Okay? - Everything okay in here? - I don't know, it looks like an allergic reaction! - Okay Abby, grab me an Epi-pen! What kind of shot did she give him? - Tetanus. - No, Penicillin. - Penicillin? No, he's allergic to Penicillin! - Okay. Nate, call an ambulance. I want him transported to ER. - It didn't say anything about that on. - We got it. Thanks, Abby. Come on kiddo. There you go! - What? - The little boy was fine though, right? - Yeah, that's not the point. I mean, this poor kid could have died today because of me and I just. It was literally right there on the chart. I just. I don't know where my head is. - I know you feel bad but you're a good nurse, honey. You made a mistake once. Don't beat yourself up over it. Okay? - So when are you supposed to see that head-shrinker again? - Dr. Tocaro? - Yeah. - Wednesday. And, why do you call her a head-shrinker? - That's what people call psychologists. 'Cause they get into your head and they screw you up. - No they don't. - Just watch. I bet she's going to tell you that we shouldn't be friends. - Why? - I don't know. Just be careful what you say. Anything you tell her, she'll repeat it to your mom. - She said she wouldn't do that. - Okay. Well, if you wanna believe that, go ahead. - You think she lied about that? - I mean, think about it. If your mom and dad are paying her. You think she'll really keep a secret? No way. I miss you. - I miss you too. - Can I come pick you up? - Right now? - Yeah, why not? I'll have you back before your parents even wake up. - Not tonight. - Okay, so you don't miss me that much? - Yes I do. - Well, then let me come pick you up. I'll be there in like 10 minutes. - Wait. - I hope you don't mind if I stare. I just can't help myself. You're, beautiful. - I wish we didn't have to meet up in secret. I hate lying to my mom and dad. - You know I can go to jail for that, you can never tell anyone that we hang out. - Really? Jail? - Yeah. I'm 22. I can't date anyone under 18, it's illegal. - That's a stupid law. - I agree. But it's worth the risk. That's how much I care about you. You have an eyelash right there. Close your eyes and make a wish. - I thought I was supposed to do that. - No. The person who blows it off is the one that makes your wish come true. - What's wrong? - I don't know. I'm started to get worried about this psychologist. I'm getting a bad feeling that they're trying to split us up. - I told you already. I'm not going to say anything. - You just don't get it. These shrinks like to get inside your brain and they make you say things that you don't want to say. I used to go to one. - What should I do? - You should stop going. - I have to. My parents are making me. - Look, I should've known this wasn't going to work. - No, don't say that! I want to be with you. - But you want to please your parents more. - That's not true. It's just, I feel really torn. - Promise me that you stop seeing Dr. Tocaro. Otherwise, I know my heart will be broken and we may as well end things now. - I promise! I'll figure something out. I swear. - It's getting pretty light out. I gotta get you home. - Regan, what the hell are you? - Shh! You'll wake mom and dad. - Did you sneak out? - My God, please please please don't tell them. - Where were you? - To the park. - With who? - I was by myself. - I don't buy that for a second. If you don't tell me who you were with, I'm gonna go wake up mom and dad right now. - Okay. But you have to promise not to tell them I was leaving. - What are you girls doing? - Nothing. We were just, getting a drink of water. - Okay, go back to bed. - We will. There. Now fess up. - Fine. I was a meeting a boy. - You walked all the way to the park to meet a boy? Who? - He drove me there. In his car. - His Car? How old is he? - He's, 16. You don't know him. He goes to Angeles High School. - Mom and Dad would freak out if they knew you were dating a 16-year-old. What's his name? - Milo. He's super cool and I really like him. Plus I'll be 15 in like five months so the age difference isn't really that big of a deal. Please, please don't tell them. - Alright. But, you have to swear, you have to swear that you will tell me when you sneak out. Someone has to know where you are and if mom and dad notice that you're gone, they won't freak out and call the cops again. - Deal. Thank you, you're like the best sister ever. - Go to bed, Regan. - Hey. - Hey. - Looks good. - Honey, do you think with the promotion in limbo, and everything, maybe we should rethink giving Taylor... - No, no, it's her sweet 16. I want to do it. - You're right. Let's just forget about what an absolute crappy week we both had and, just try and enjoy this day. Can you believe that we have a kid that can drive? I mean, when did that happen? - 40 is the new 20, - Yeah, yeah. Tell that to my 40-year-old body. - There ain't nothing wrong with your 40-year-old body, - Get a room. - Honey, can you go get your sister? Thanks, Love! - Nice. Yay! - Happy Birthday! - Thanks, Mom! - Happy Birthday, Sweetie! - Thanks, Dad! - Alright, let's do it! - Here Honey. This is from me and your dad. - Just a little something! - No way! - Way! - Go check the driveway. - Shut up! My god! Hey. - Hey. - You okay? - Yeah. - Listen. I know you're going through some tough stuff right now, so, if you ever need a ride, I'll take you wherever you want to go. - Thanks. - How's your guy? Milo, right? - Yeah. - Have you guys kissed yet? - No, not yet. I kinda want to. What kind of car does he drive? - Um, a Mercedes I think. Yeah, super fancy. - Mercedes, must be loaded. - Yeah, his parents are. I don't even know why he has a job, because they're like millionaires. - Where does he work? - Um, at that yogurt shop in the mall. - Cool. Well, maybe sometime we can go and visit him. Just you and me. - Sure. - Keep studying! - Hey love, you're still up? - Yeah. - Did you have a good birthday? - The best. You and Dad are amazing. - You're amazing, honey. You deserve it. - There's something I've been meaning to tell you. - Okay, - It's about Regan. She can't know I told you. - Honey, if there's something that we should know, then you should tell us. - Well, Regan snuck out last night to meet a boy she likes. He's 16. - So there's nobody named Milo who works at that yogurt shop in the mall. - You think she lied about his name or the school? Or both? - Who knows. - Well, one of our patient's kids goes to South. I left her a message to see if she knows anything about this kid. - Regardless, I think we need to confront Regan about it when she gets home tonight. - And betray Taylor's trust? No way. Yeah, that'll be great! Then we'll have two kids that won't tell us anything. - You're right. - The troll's here. I'm gonna bounce. - See you in econ. - Um, are you dating Austin now? - Made it official after first period. - How can you do that after what he did to me? He sent my pictures all over the school and got me in so much trouble. - Maybe you shouldn't have sent those pictures to begin with. - Wait, are you seriously be siding with him right now? - I'm staying out of it. This between you and him. - Unbelievable. You know what? I don't care what Austin thinks and I don't care what you think either. I have a boyfriend who's much better than him anyway. Not a boy, a man. - No you don't. That's a lie. - Yes I do. He's 22, he drives a Mercedes and he's in love with me. So suck it. - Hey guys, how are you? If you can, just go ahead and fill this out for me. He'll be with you in a second. - Jim! Regan! - Hey! Come here! Come here you son of a, come here. Get in the house! - Go! I can't believe that you would do this. After everything that we talked about! Honey, we trusted you! - Why are you doing this to me? I love him and want to be with him! - Who Regan? Who do you want to be with? - His name's Milo and he goes to Angeles High School. - No it's not! There is no Milo that works at any yogurt shop, so you are lying to me! Now stop playing games and you tell me who he is! - How do you even know to ask that? You told 'em! You promised me that you wouldn't! - God, I should never have told you anything! I knew you would do this! - Taylor! - I'm so sorry, Regan! - Taylor, please go to your room, honey. Now you're going to tell me who he is and you're going to give me his phone number. Right now. - I'm not giving you anything! - Who is this? - You know, you can't stop me from seeing your daughter. - She is 14 years old. I'm not going to let you ever see her again. - You think so? I own her and you. How are things at work? It would be a shame if more pictures started showing up. - You listen to me. You will stay away from my daughter. And you're going to stay away from my family. And if you don't. - Jim. - Regan, go upstairs. Now! - What is it? - He's the one who sent the pictures to the board. - What? - He just admitted to it. He also told me that he owns Regan. - Morning. - Morning. - You look tired. I was about to make some coffee. You want some? - Yeah, please, that'd be great, thanks. Did any messages come in for me or anything? - Yes. One message from some lawyers office regarding the investigation over the penicillin incident. - I actually can't believe this is happening. - I know. We can hopefully find a way to get through it. - He actually said he owned her? - Those were his exact words. - Wow! - I know, I know. And she won't even tell us who he is. I'm just hoping Dr. Tocaro gets something out of her today. I just. - If anyone can, she will. She's the best in the business. Man, this guy sounds like a psycho. - Who's a psycho? - Thanks. - No one. Just this guy that Abby met. Well, if nothing comes of the session today, I say you get the police involved. - What's going on? What happened? - It's nothing I want to get into, really. It's a long story. - Well, okay. Look, if you need anyone to talk, I'm here. - Thanks, Nate. Appreciate it. Listen to me, honey. You can trust Dr. Tocaro, okay. She's not going to repeat anything that you say, okay. Just, it's best thing to be open and honest with her. - Okay. - Okay, I'll pick you up in an hour. I love you, kiddo. - Bye. - I felt that you were really open to me last time we talked, Regan. But today, it seems you don't want to talk very much at all. Did something happen between last session and today? - No. It's just I'm just sick of people telling me what to do. I don't even want to be here. - Why not? I thought you liked talking to me. - You're just trying to get inside my head and then shrink it and then tell my mom and dad everything I say. - Regan, that is absolutely untrue. Who told you that? - No one. - So tell me about this boyfriend. What's he like? - I don't want to talk about him. - Okay, maybe we can talk about what you're looking for in a boyfriend. The qualities you're looking for maybe in somebody that you'd like to be with. - I guess I want someone who is older than me. - Really? How old? - I don't know. Out of school. Yeah, I hate all the kids at school. - Okay. Well, he would probably then have a job. What kind of job do you want him to have? - Well, a job where he makes a lot of money so he can buy me stuff. Maybe like in a doctor's office. Anything in the medical field. - Okay. What else? - Maybe drive a nice car. - You ready, love? - Mhm. - Mrs. Lindstrom, can I speak with you for just a moment? - Of course. Where are you going? - The bathroom. Can I not do that without a babysitter? - Hey gorgeous. - Nate! - Shh, come on. Before your mom sees us. - I can't leave with you right now. - Well, why not? - Because, my parents would kill me. They're super pissed at you right now. My Dad thinks that you sent my picture to everyone he works with. - Yeah, I did. - What, why? - Why? Because your dad's a jerk. He thinks he can control everything that you do. Besides, look I know that you hate coming here anyway. So, if he gets fired, then he'll lose his insurance and you'll never have to come here again. - I don't want my dad to lose his job. - What do you care? You basically said that you hated him. - I know but that's not... - Alright, come on. Your mom's gonna be here in a minute, let's go. - No. I'm sick of being in trouble, okay. I can't. - You're being a real pain in the ass right now. I left work early to come you up, now come on. - Nate, no! - I said, let's go! - Thank you for that update. I think having her come two times a week is a great idea. - I'll see you next Wednesday then. - Okay. - Will you excuse me, I need to meet somebody right outside. - Yeah, of course. - Regan? Have you seen my daughter, Regan? - Mom! Mom! Mom, Mom! - Regan! - Mom! - Regan! - Mom! - Regan! - Mom! Mom, mom! - Regan! - Abby! Abby, please wait for the police, honey. Alright, look, I'm on my way to Detective White's office right now to see if they can trace these N-Dog calls and texts. - Okay, and, I'll, I'll call Sabine and any of Regan's friends that may have some idea who this guy is. - It's an internet phone number and all the texts are through GEM. We can't trace the number, but we contacted GEM and requested any information associated with this account. - How long will that take? - They are not obligated to respond, but ever since Tara disappeared, and we were able to link it back to texts sent on GEM, they have been very cooperative. - Well, did you find Tara? Is she okay? - We haven't found her yet, but the connection to GEM is very important. - So this could be the same guy? - We don't know that that's the case. - This is insane! You have two child abductions, two girls have been taken and you don't know who's done that and where they are. I'm gonna need a little help here Detective White. This is my daughter. I have to find her right now. - Mr Lindstrom, I understand that you're upset. You said that Regan had a psychologist, right? - Yes, Dr. Tocaro. I spoke with her, she said her sessions are confidential and she's bound by law. - This is a child abduction case. Confidentiality no longer applies. Let's call the doctor. - Where are we going, Nate? - Someplace safe. - She talked about a boy who admired her, he was older, but she never gave me his name. - Can you remember anything else she may have mentioned about him. - Let me check my notes. She said, she wanted somebody to have a lot of money that worked in a doctor's office. - So she wanted to marry a doctor? - No, she didn't say that she wanted to marry a doctor, she said very specifically that she wanted to marry someone who worked in a doctor's office or the medical field. - Right. Are you telling me that she may have been describing her boyfriend? - It's possible. - Okay, is that it? - Yes, my notes stop there. Wait, wait, there's one more thing. She showed me a key chain that her boyfriend gave her. It was on her backpack. - Come on. Sit down! - Why are you doing this? - I can't trust you. They're brainwashing you! Trying to control you. - I'm really scared right now. - Don't be. Don't be scared. By tomorrow we're gonna be so far away, so far from all of these people that are trying to break us apart. - We can't just leave, Nate! I have my family, I have school. - What we have is so special. And we have to fight to keep going, or they'll try to pull us apart. - What are you talking about? They won't keep us apart. - Yes they will. My family, your family, everybody will try to break us apart. - No Nate! They will listen! - That's a lie, and you know it! Why are you trying to protect them? - I'm not. - Do you really think they're just gonna let us be together? Of course not. We have to get out of here right now, or very soon, or they're going to come here and I'm not going to have a choice. - What? - Don't make a sound. - I think this is what she was talking about. - That's it. That's the keychain. Mom has them at her clinic. They give them away to the kids sometimes. - That's a major coincidence unless that guy was actually down at the clinic. We've got to call Dr. Blockman. Come on. - Yeah. - No. - Don't make a sound. - Hello. - This is Det. White. We have the address on the credit card associated with the GEM account. - Great, will you please text that to me. - Mr. Lindstrom, we are gonna have to follow up this lead. - Detective, this is my daughter, every second counts, we both know that. - I'm sorry but this is a police matter and we cannot officially send you this address. I'll keep in touch. - Hey, it's from Mom. She says Nate quit today so he's not in the office. I'm going to his house to see if he's seen or heard from Regan. - Alright, so lets go meet her at Nate's house. Call her for the address. - Hey it's Abby, leave a message. - Voicemail. I'll call Dr. Blockman's office. They'll have it. - Hello? - Abby! What a surprise. - Nate. Hi, sorry, the door was open, I tried knocking, but I just. I didn't know that you heard me so I just kind of. - No, no, no, I didn't. Did you knock? I, how long have you been there? - A couple minutes, actually. I tried calling but I couldn't get through on your phone so. - Yeah you know I've been having a problem with the phone lately. I don't even know what's going on. Are you here because I quit today? I meant to say goodbye to everyone but you know how it is. - Not at all, actually. Look, something really terrible has happened to Regan and I just, I need your help. - Abby, what's going on? - Regan's been abducted and I'm talking to everyone that knows her trying to find any information that can help us find her. - Look, have you talked to her friends? - Yes, I have literally talked to everybody and nothing, so anything you can tell me. - I'm happy to help in anyway I can. What can I do? - Unofficially, 1821 Darcy Lane. - Thank you Detective. Honey, listen, before we meet your Mom, we're gonna stop by this guys house, okay? When we get there, I want you to stay in the car. Just let me handle it. Got it? - Got it. Dad. - Yeah? - Look at this. The GEM address and Nate's address are the same, 1821 Darcy Lane. - Call and text your mother. Now! - If I hear anything, Abby, I will definitely call you. I'm so sorry about Regan. - Thanks, Nate. I really. - Mom don't go to Nate's, we think he has Regan! The police are on the way. - I guess I should be going so. - You stay in this car until the police arrive, okay? - Okay. - Lock the doors. - Nate, sorry to bother you. - No, no, I wish I could of been more help. - You you going on a trip or? - Help! Help me! Somebody! Help! - Regan! - Don't move. No. - Mom! - Regan! - Mom! - Are you okay? Are you okay? - Yes. - Abby! Regan! - Come on, come on, come on! Duck down. Get in the corner. Let's go, come on. Not a sound. - Okay. - Not a sound, shh, shh, shh! - Abby! Regan! - Abby! Regan! - Hey, it's Abby, leave a message. - Abby! Regan! - No Nate! Please, no! Nate! No! Nate! No! - Abby! - Jim, he's got a gun. - Abby, where's, where's Regan? - She's okay, she's inside. - Neither of you are gonna be fine. I'll make sure of that. Now put the crow bar! - No, no, no, no, no. - You're not gonna stop me from seeing Regan. - You listen to me. No one's gotten hurt. You walk away right now, you put that gun down. No harm done. - He's right. Nate, listen to me, just. - I don't know Jim. - Dad! - That was a really bad idea! - Thank you. My god Dad, are you okay? - Hey, I'm alright. It's okay, baby. Sanchez, call it in. We'll need paramedics. Barnes, secure the crime scene. - I can't believe you're doing all the same stuff I'm doing in chemistry. I mean, we learned this unit like two weeks ago. - I love my new school so much more than my old one. - Hey. Look what I just got today. - Wait, is that, is that what I think it is? Is this your first check as Executive Director? - Executive Director, thats right. - So fancy. - Bring it in. Bring it in. Thank you. And ladies, to celebrate, we're all going to the Bahamas. I just booked us a cruise. - What? - My God, dad really? - Can't even believe all that we've been through? - I know. The important thing is that Tara's safe and more important than that, we are safe. - Yeah, true. - So, what do you think? - It's amazing! - I'm excited! - You guys got to share a room though! - What! - What do you mean, what! - Dad, come on! - We're sharing a room, you guys gotta share a room. That's how it works. - Of course you're sharing a room. - We're too old for this. - It's got a view of the ocean and a really small window. You're gonna love it. - It's a cruise, of course it's the ocean! - I know. But you're gonna love it. It's gonna be great!
