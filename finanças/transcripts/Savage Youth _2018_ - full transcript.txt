How long you had that van for? I... It's my mom's, so for like a while. Should we take the bitch on a road trip before summer's over? No, actually we can't, 'cause I'm not gonna be here. We're just like saving up money to leave. How much you need? Like, just enough for gas and shit. Well, we should rob that trap floor boyfriend ya'll got. I bet he's got stacks on deck, doesn't he? Yeah, he probably got lots of money. Uh, actually we should thief him. What? No! -Yeah. Yeah, let's let's po... Let's snatch his shit. Yeah, like, we could really use the money. Let's do it. Hey. When I go like this... that's when we jump. Yeah. Got me? I'ma fuck him up. Show me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Elena. What do you think? Let's do it. So, what do you do? What, for a living? To pass the time. Kick ass and chew bubblegum. You're so mad. -It's just I hate her. You're so mad. -I just can't stand her. If my name was a number, it'd probably be 37. I just think it's sad that as all these babies that die here... they... they didn't even know their names, you know I heard that you were born high as a baby. That must be tough. Yeah, but it's a woman's right to do whatever she wants with her body, no matter what the Bible says. So... I think what you did was right. I do. Jay told me if you guys wanna drink any of this, you can. I'm good. -No, we're okay. You sure? - I like Elena. I love her. -Maybe you should treat her right. What, you think you're gonna do something about it if I don't? No, you see, I'm a lover. I pay people to do that type of shit for me. What you say to him? -Nothing. We just talked. He's not so bad. Yeah. What? Are you okay? -Yeah? I'm on your side. Yeah, I know, baby. What up? Hey, come on out. I can't. I'm with my girl. Hey, I'm with some girls, too, man. Come on. How's it going, man? Look, just come out and meet us, man. I can't. Come on, stop being a little bitch, man. Come on. No. All right. You straight? You know if you need me I can make it, bro. No, no, no. It's all right. Just, everything's tight. Have a nice night, Mike. Come on. Gonna text Hyde. No, don't. Please. Hyde's no fun anymore. He's sober now. Were you aware of this? He's fucking taking classes. Wants to be a fucking teacher. - Professor fuck-face. Professor fuck-face, indeed. You know, school's not for everybody. It's good for him, right? Yeah, I guess so. Guess it's great for him. And then, she was like, "I dig it." -Yeah. And I was like four years old. Doing it since then? -Yeah. Yo, where's your ass at, man? Kickin' at E's crib right now. Yo, E, what's your address? 1313, Oakwood Drive. You get that? Word. My boy's coming over. What's he like? He's a grown-ass man. You'll like him. I can see The white birds everywhere They ain't hers, everywhere I can stare White birds in the sky Shoot 'em down Bang, bang, till they die Till they die White birds in the sky Imma see one bird imma shoot 'em dead Imma see one bird Imma shoot him in his head White birds in the sky Shoot 'em dead White birds in the sky Give 'em back Give 'em bread White birds Bake 'em, mama Break 'em, mama hit 'em, mama Smack 'em, mama Break 'em, mama, take 'em White birds in the sky White birds in the sky Elena? -Hi, Michael. Pop, pop, pop, pop Like the sound Of a hammer on meat The same sound as the sound Of this fist When I left the bruise On my mama's cheek Click, click, click, clack Now my old daddy's Locked away Mama's passed away I'm trying to say this grace But ain't got no place To pray This world is sad What if someone's pushing dials in life. Like... Like, what if... What if we're not doing it, and it's like a video game. Like, God's up in heaven and he's playing on, like, a giant Xbox. Be a fucked up game, I tell you that, It'd be like, uh, I was playing Grand Theft Auto... It would be like some Grand Theft Auto shit. Funny you say that, though. I always used to think that life is just like... like a dream, like, we just like babies, you know what I'm saying? -Yeah. Just, like, in a crib, sleeping and dreaming. Okay, yeah. So when do we wake up? I don't know. Shit. So, you got a baby at home? Yeah, Tiana, she's two. That's a pretty name. -Yeah. Do you wanna see pictures? -Sure. That face, I can't get over it. -Wow. Could I see? -Yeah. Yeah, she cute. I got a little one, too, actually. Oh, really? You like that line, 'in the flash line'? You like that shit? Yeah, man. That shit's dope. -Word? You wrote that? -Yeah? It's not bad. Actually, better than I expected. For real. For real? -For real. Appreciation, man. Thanks for listening. I got one question, though. -What's up? Why y'all white boys always rapping about that horror movie shit? Why brothers always rapping about bitches and money? That ain't all it's about. Tell me what it's about then. You wouldn't understand, I guess. 'Cause I'm white? Yeah. Shit, you mad, bro? Ah, man. She's pretty, isn't she? Like the way she looks? You wanna fuck her, don't you? You wanna fuck my girl, man? That what you wanna do? You can come here and fucking disrespect me like that and try to fuck my girl? -She's not yours. Hmm? What's that supposed to mean? That mean she don't belong to no-fucking-body. Fuck you. -Fuck you. Hey, I think that you should go. You heard her. You little passive-aggressive fucking bitch. Get the fuck out. Who the fuck are you talking to? I'm talking to you, motherfucker. Get the fuck out. -You want a fight, just get it over with. I got bodies, motherfucker. -My dad's... Fuck you. Hey, don't fucking talk to her like that. Mike, Mike, wake up. I hit him with the south-side. The fuck, man? Wake up. Oh, my God, oh, my God... Get the fuck off me. Get the fuck off me. Yep. My mama always said that family's the most important thing in life. I'd never believe that until now. I just had to find you. You may not be blood but you my family. Right. You're definitely my family. He got, like, sixty bucks. Take it. Lucas, sit down. -You don't want it? Nobody's gonna fucking go anywhere or do anything, until we figure this shit out. You don't actually think you're getting away with this, do you? No, we're in this together. No fucking way we are. You wanted to rob him. It's his mom. Give it to me. Lucas... Take that shit, fuck it up, get rid of it. Far away. Stephanie, take your mother's fucking minivan, take him, dump their fucking car somewhere far away. Let's be fucking smart, let's use our fucking head, instead of our fucking pussy for once. You fucking understand me? Give me a nod for yes. Nod yes. Nod yes. Good girl. I'll take care of this shit. I've never seen a dead body before. When I was younger, I went to this boarding school. And there was this kid, and he walked right into the showers, and he shot himself in the head. And I always thought that was, like... a nice thing to do, 'cause... he didn't want nobody to clean up after him, you know? So, you taken? 'Cause I was thinking, if we get out of this, maybe me and you... we could kick it sometime. Lucas, you're a really nice guy but you're not my type. Sorry. You could, like, sell this shit. It's good. Elena? If you're going out, pick us some trash bags. Jumbo. Hey, girl, you should smile a lot more. It's all good, Jay, I got it. -No. I need some shit to do this with. Yeah, all right. I'll get you some coke. Yeah. Jason, did you take care of it? Um, I'm out. You're leaving? Yeah, I have to pick my baby up. Just don't say anything, Steph. Everything okay, ma'am?
