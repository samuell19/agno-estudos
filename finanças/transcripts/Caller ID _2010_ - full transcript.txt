[pulsing electronic percussion] [whirring electronic tones] - I woke up to her talking to my boyfriend at, like, three in the morning, um, and it was, because I had called him, and I, I just, I don't even know how I dialed his phone number 'cause I was asleep, or I was in this state. And I, he, he doesn't know what I said to him. I just started talking in, in tongues, and, uh, after I woke up, I didn't realize what I had done. [skittering and jangling electronic effects] - [Woman On Recording] Why do you wanna hurt me so much? Are you sick? You, you're really strange. [whirring electronic effects over ominous ambient music] I was like, it's like this is some kind of addiction that I've gotta break away from and, uh, he encouraged it and he shoulda just left me alone 'cause I don't really think he cares about me. [crackling electronic effects over unsettling ambient music] And I don't think he'll ever understand why I'm the way I, I am, 'cause sometimes I don't understand it myself. [muffled sigh] [eerie and unsettling ambient electronic music] I don't even know, I, I don't think he ever loved me. I don't think he meant it at all. I wish he did. [beeping electronic tones over shuddering ambient music] I just wanna know. [eerie and unsettling ambient music with shuddering rhythm] [unsettling melodic tones over whirring ambient music] - [Reporter] US military has issued four million dollars in grants to university researchers to study ways to read people's thoughts, but critics say such mind reading technology could be used during interrogations. The project's a corroboration among researchers at the University of California. [jangling bell tones] - [Voice On PA] Now arriving Vermont/Santa Monica Station. Exit here for Los Angeles City College. [eerie ambient music with unsettling electronic tones] - [Woman] You haven't boarded already? [eerie ambient music with shuddering rhythm] Why don't you stick, we stick with Purple Line? - Right, yeah. You're not makin' it easy. - [sighs] Do you know where this is that we're at [grunts], where the station is? - [Onlooker] Uh-- - [Tristan] I need to get to Palmdale. - No, uh, you're far from that, buddy. [Tristan screeching nonsensically] Are you OK? - [Woman On Recording] You're sadistic and sick, and I hate your guts. [Tristan groans over phone cracking to ground] - Buddy, what's your fucking problem? - It burns! - Fucking asshole! - It's not me. - [Woman On Recording] You've got some kind of need to play weird games, and his games are gettin' really dangerous. [woman shrieks] - Will someone help me? Hey, buddy, give that back to me! Shit! [Tristan groaning] - [Woman On Recording] I just think I should pull myself, I'm wasted like hell, you're makin' me fuckin' sick! - Hey, hey what's your problem? - [Woman On Recording] I wanna punch your balls off! [eerie ambient music with shuddering rhythm] - [Onlooker] Call the police. Hey, he's-- [eerie ambient music with shuddering rhythm] [Tristan shouts desperately] - [Man] The first law of thermodynamics [shuddering percussion] energy cannot be created or destroyed, only changed into other forms. It's one of the first things they teach you in science class, but sometimes, we have to learn things the hard way. [eerie and pulsing electronic music] [controller buzzing] [static crackling over beeping electronic tones] - [Woman On recording] Yeah, I know you've got enough evidence, and it doesn't matter about these calls anymore because I'm already in way over my head anyway, so I can just tell you what I think. If you're trying to set me up to hurt me, you can do it, so go ahead and do it, get it over with. I don't care anymore, you know, 'cause then I'll know for sure that I could never trust you anyway. [electronics buzzing] [whirring ambient tones] [muffled radio chatter over throbbing electronic music] [radio beeps] - [Officer On Radio] Cruiser 10, I need a medical crew and guide. I've got one victim of interest. - [Dispatch] Copy. Units responding to the shooting, be sure to remain on channel two, channel function normal. [static crackling over rhythmic electronic music] [engines rumbling over rhythmic electronic music] [car horns honking] [rhythmic and tense electronic music] [transmission crunching] [briefcase rattling] [doors rattling over tense electronic music] [static crackles] [footsteps thudding over tense electronic music] [door rattling] [gun clacking on desk] [briefcase rattling] [chair clanging on floor] [briefcase clacking] [eerie and tense electronic music] [hard drive clacking into computer] - I don't know how much longer I have, man. [sighs] A lot of the time, I just sound like I'm fucking crazy. They make you sound like you're fucking crazy, arright? You know what I'm fucking talking about! This is a warning, man, you need to save it, and you need to put it somewhere safe, OK? Look, my time has come, your time is now, because then your time will come, and it's time for you to stand up, and it's time for you to make precautions, all right? This isn't a fuckin' diatribe, it's a eulogy, and understand this is the last image you're gonna see and understand what you need to do. Upload everything you have and preserve it, man. Upload and run, upload and run, run, run! Upload and run! [keyboard clacking] - This is the part we need to to back up. I'm uploading offsite. It, it's not safe here anymore! [electronic buzzing] [eerie ambient music] - Hello, I am here to guide you through the specialized study program. You will be developing new technologies for the study of the mind. I hope you do well in all your assignments. - Yeah, it's, uh, actually pretty cool. You get to participate in an independent study and still, at the end of it all, you get a masters degree in psychopathology. - [Miles] I've just always wanted to be part of something groundbreaking, and I think this could be it. - Miles? - Yes? - Follow me, please. - Thanks, man, see ya. [ominous ambient music] [phone ringing] [eerie strings over ominous ambient music] [door creaking] [footsteps clacking] What's with all the heavy screening? - It's nothing to stress out about. Everyone has to go through the same screening process in order to be accepted into the program. It's a small, exclusive class. [whirring and buzzing electronic effects] OK, let me just get the system dialed in to your reactions. [whirring electronic effects over ominous ambient music] Currently in LA, there are approximately 800 open murder cases of young girls. - God! - Many of them were abused. Our work here is to prevent psychopathologies that lead to suffering and often to violent death. Sometimes, we lose people from the program because it's just too much for them to handle. Are you prepared to become involved in difficult situations which could test you emotionally? - I'm on my way to becoming a doctor, obviously. Emotionally detach myself from patients. - I hope to be able to help people with mental handicaps that have been cast aside. - There's nothing more in the world I wanna do than dedicate my life to this program. - Anything I can do to help. - Whatever you ask me, I'll do it. This is all I want. - OK, Room 107 tomorrow at one p.m. You'll be meeting with our head of admissions. - OK. [computer buzzing over eerie ambient music] [whirring electronic tones] - [Man In Mask] I'm a conscious dreamer myself. I can set myself and go somewhere, and when I go there, then I see everything. I can fly around, I can see papers on desks. In top security places, they put everything on tape now 'cause you can't really go get a tape and put in on a machine and play it, but you can look at a desk with papers on it and read those papers. - I mean, these people are a fucking cult! I mean, do you understand that they're using you? I mean, everything has gone haywire! Tell me you understand that. They took me in and made me feel like I was somebody. They understood me, treated me like a family. My mother died when I was five, and my father doesn't even know that I existed. You're a bastard, an orphan. Hey, save it for brunch! Family week, that guys an asshole! He doesn't give a fuck about you! He used you, man! Are you gonna let me talk? He used you, don't you understand that? What I'm tryin' to say is-- [lighter snapping] What can I do to make you understand? What can you do to understand that you grabbed onto this fucking cult? I'm-- I'm so drained right now, I can barely move. - [Mysterious Woman] Depending on how well they take on that frequency, that person may direct that frequency, and they could start hallucinating, it could start, um, changing their, their, their waveforms, they could start fighting with themselves. Then they'd have a split personality, then that just goes into a whole nother snowball effect of insanity to themselves, and then they're uncontrollable. [ominous ambient music with buzzing electronic tones] [door rattling] - Miles, right? - [Miles] Yes. - Thank you so much for coming. - [Miles] Thanks for seeing me. - No problem, find the place OK? - [Miles] Yeah, yeah. - Well, you weren't waitin' long? - [Miles] No, no. - Good, good, good, good. Before we get started, there's something you've gotta understand. If you become part of this program, you cannot talk about this with anybody, Miles. - I understand. - They'll just get confused. You just can't talk about it, so I've got your word as a fellow scientist? - You have my word. - Good, so, I ask this to everybody. Why, why are you interested in psychopathology? - Growing up, I was exposed to a lot of violence at a very young age. I was, uh, raised in a home. - Orphanage? - [Miles] Yeah. - I lost my parents when I was young. - Growing up, I wanted to be a part of something that made a difference, and I think the research you're doing here is incredible. - There's nothing usual about this program. There's nothing like it on this campus or anyplace else. Everybody works at their own pace, independently, and Miles, I don't see an end to this. [eerie, buzzing ambient music] It's limitless. [eerie, buzzing ambient music] The only limit to this program is one's imagination. You know? I can count on you, there's a lot of people who aren't gonna understand what we do here, out of ignorance, fear, but-- [eerie ambient music] - I wanna be a part of it, I wanna help. - You've got an old soul. See it in your eyes. [ominous and eerie ambient music] I can't remember the last time I said this, but I got a good feeling about you, I really do. [ominous ambient music] I want you to take this home, OK? Look at it, your first assignment. [ominous and eerie ambient music] - I wanna do a great job. - Thanks, Miles. [ominous and eerie ambient music] [door rattling] You're gonna have to. [eerie electronic music] [traffic whooshing] [eerie electronic music] [plastic crinkling] [eerie electronic music] [phone buzzing] - Hello, I am Adam Whitney, the director of this program. Dale, you'll be working to different miniature camera technologies to use for the study of human behavior patterns. Miles, you will be creating sensors to measure fluctuations in the body's energy field. Tristan, I want you to study the relation between bioplasma and the human DNA. Noah, I want you to study these images carefully so that you will remember the information whenever I test you. [distorted groaning over eerie ambient music] - [Woman] Stop it, stop, stop! [distorted voices over eerie ambient music] [phone buzzing] [eerie and ominous ambient music] [Noah sighs] [briefcase rattling] [Noah sighs] [traffic whooshing] [button clacking] [eerie humming ambiance] - [Woman On Recording] I suppose you think just 'cause I have an illness, a mental illness, that you can treat me like I'm some kind of guinea pig. I am a human being, and you don't have any right to treat me this way. I don't know who you people are or what you're doing this for, I don't really care. I never met such sick human beings in my life. You know what, your whole fuckin' profession sucks. [muffled rattling] [eerie ambient music] [traffic whooshing over ominous electronic music] - [Mysterious Woman] All information is on different levels of energy. There's already a frequency up here and it's coming off of every television set, computer system, telephone. They're just constantly coming out, you can't get away from it. They could just stimulate your thoughts and feelings. Make you love, depressed, fear, hate, move any part of your body. They could have you jump off an airplane. They could have you crash the airplane. You may be struggling with it the whole time, but you would inevitably, would have to surrender to it. [ominous ambient music] [machinery whirring] [muffled chatter] - [Noah] You don't happen to have any acetaminophen, do you? - [Miles] No, not on me. - So, uh, what-what, what do you think of these assignments? - I think they're pretty amazing, actually, but we're not supposed to be talking about our specific assignments. It's an independent study, remember? - I'm having a difficult time, uh, digesting these case studies. [eerie electronic music] They're kind of fucked up to be honest with you. - Come on, these people need our help. Just give yourself a little bit of time, Noah, you're just letting it get to you. Hey, do you know a guy named Dale Wilton? Wasn't he a friend of yours from high school? So I heard he enrolled in the program, too. - Unless he got in, I saw him at the, uh, reunion, fucker! Last got in touch with each other years back. We had this horrible fight. - [Miles] Ah, bury the hatchet. - Yeah, a friend is a friend. [vaguely ominous electronic music] [ominous, rumbling ambiance] [traffic whooshing] [doors rattling] [elevator whirring] - [Man] I put cameras everywhere, everywhere! [eerie and tense electronic music] It was a sick game, it kept getting sicker. We were like fresh blood transfusions for a parasitic dictator who was addicted to immortality. [muffled chatter over eerie and tense electronic music] - [Bouncer] ID? - Come on, drink up, man, you all right? - Yeah. I'm OK. - Forget about the program, it's the end of the week. Time to get out. - All right, I'm good, I'm just, you know, a little tired, that's all. - Yeah, you look tired [scoffs]. - [scoffs] Life is standing upright, spinning around on bullshit, here, cheers. [glasses clink] - Can I get a shot of something real strong, uh, whiskey? - Yeah, my favorite one, too. [eerie and tense electronic music] - I'm gonna be in a very awkward situation in a second. But thank you, wow! - [Miles] No, wait, here he comes, here he comes. - Really? [tense, eerie ambient music] This is way too fucking confusing-- - Miles, Noah, hey. - What's goin' on? - I just wanted to know if you fuckers have put the past behind us. - Well, why would I hold resentment? That's been such a long time ago. - You know that bullshit that went down, it's, like, I apologize, and I'm sorry. - Saw you and Bernice Hall. Figured you'd become a psych student. - It's, uh, it's the only thing that's inspired me. - Obviously something, right? - Don't hate me, man. [tense electronic music] It's good to see you guys. - Well, it's, uh, good to see you. [tense electro rock music] - That guy over there ordered you guys a couple of drinks. - [Miles] What guy? - Your friend, Dale. Two black devils. - [Miles] I am not fuckin' drinkin' this. - He's not being nice anyway. Fuck that guy. [muffled chatter over tense electro rock music] [traffic whooshing] - [Cheryl] I'm writin' a letter here, and I'm gonna get this off my chest once and for all. The letter is to the dean, and I'm really sorry [sighs], but you ruined my life, you know that? I had a nervous breakdown, you ruined my fuckin' life, man, and you did it on purpose, and, uh, you enjoyed it. And you deserve for me to turn you in, I should've turned you in a long time ago, 'cause what you did to me was wrong. You were sexually harassing me, I'm sorry, that's exactly what it was. Regardless of whether I went with it or how I felt about you. That's exactly what is was, OK, but don't rub my nose in it, because I covered up for you, you fuckin' prick. [ominous and tense electronic music] [traffic humming] [phone buzzing over eerie and ominous ambient music] - [Woman On Phone] Yeah, I think the whole thing was a setup 'cause he's got some kind of need to play weird games, and his games would get really dangerous, you know? He'd better watch out. I don't need this shit, I need a normal person. I may be schizophrenic or whatever the hell I've got, but I'm more normal than you'll ever be. [ominous ambient music] [muffled rattling] - [Man On Phone] They're, they're, they're doin' studies for the government. Th-that's the, the reason they're getting the funding for all of this. They wanna have weapons that are undetectable unless you know what you're looking for. Unless you know how to interlace the waveforms, break down the synapses of the brain. They know they can't kill me because if they do, I've clouded that information somewhere and someone will find it, and unless they can get me to tell them where that's at, they may actually come out here. [ominous and eerie ambient music] [tense and unsettling ambient music] - Oh, Noah, come on in, Adam Whitney. - Very nice to finally meet you. - Sit down, please. Sit down, you ought to get off your feet. - Well, thank you. - How's your work, going along? - Going well, I guess. - I have a lot of confidence in you, Noah. Over the years, I have developed a certain sensitivity in reading people. I know you will do well here. Genesis 9:17, God said to Noah, "This is the token of the covenant "which I have established between me "and all the flesh upon this earth." I know you will do well here, Noah. - Thanks. - Very good. [ominous and eerie ambient music] [traffic whooshing over eerie ambient music] [electronics buzzing] - I don't know who you people are, and I don't really care. I've never met such sick human beings in my life. You know what, your whole fuckin' profession sucks! [phone line beeping] [ominous and eerie ambient music] [motorcycle engine rumbling] [ominous and eerie ambient music] [train horn blaring] [electronics buzzing] - [Man With Mask] Yeah, yeah, you rolling? - [Camera Operator] Mm-hmm. - [Man With Mask] Right, so I was at USC, and I was, I was a psych major. I had a little job measuring lie detector results. My teacher had there in the psych department, he got me quote "employed" out there, actually, I was just, like, the guinea pig for early mind control experiments, but the government were to cover that up so the ones that were whistleblowing, like myself, we were under threat because we were telling the truth and exposing these people, but, uh, these people didn't like to be exposed, so we got threatened as a result. [door creaking] [door thuds] [car whooshing over tense electronic music] - Pleasure, sir. - My pleasure, too. - [Miles] I'm a big fan of your work. - Huh, thank you. This is a small follow-through meeting to find out how you are doing. Is everything all right? - Absolutely, I feel like I'm finally beginning to understand how the neurotransmitters of the brain actually work. - If we could develop the tools to map the psyche of disturbed individuals, I believe we could free them from pain forever. - [Miles] That's almost overwhelming. - [Adam] Are there questions? - Not specifically. - [Adam] OK, then, see you in two weeks. - [scoffs] OK, thank you. - By the way, your friend, Noah, missed his meeting. You heard something? You know something about that? - I don't really know. [tense ambient music] He stopped returning my calls and emails days ago. [scoffs] It's like he just disappeared. - Well, I'm sorry to hear that. However, you are still here. Miles, you have a great future. - [scoffs] Thank you, sir. - Call me Adam. [eerie ambient music] [traffic whooshing over eerie ambient music] [phone buzzing and whirring] [static crackling] - [Cheryl] Is it that you just wanted to hurt me, or are you just the kind of person that likes to hurt people? You can always go work at my web training, I hear they like to sexually harass their students, too. [train whistle howling over tense electronic music] [muffled shouting over buzzing electronic effects] [electronics buzzing] [traffic whooshing] - Most of our work is done sitting at computers, but the most challenging is in the field. - That's the part I really wanna get into. - Sexuality, Miles, is the direct link to the primal scream. Orgasm is a little death. It's only when we are close to death that our minds can be pure, and we need that purity for our experiments. - [Miles] I can see that. - [Adam] I believe you are ready for the next level. Make sure you follow all the instructions to the last detail. [ominous electronic music] [footsteps clacking over ominous electronic music] - [Miles] Hey. - Hey. - [Miles] Haven't I seen you around before? What's your name? - Gemini. - Gemini, please, come in. [door crunching] So, Gemini, is that your real name? - We don't wanna talk about our real names, now, do we? - Of course not. [engine rumbling] [computer buzzing over ominous and eerie electronic music] [static crackling] [traffic whooshing] [rhythmic, vaguely ominous and eerie electronic music] [pills rattling] [rhythmic, vaguely ominous and eerie electronic music] What are the pills for? - You don't need to worry about that right now. [rhythmic, vaguely ominous and eerie electronic music] - [Miles] Give me just a second to get this thing set up. [switches clacking] [sighs] Do you ever get nervous when you're doin' this? - [Gemini] That's another question, you ask so many questions! - [Miles] Let's just get to work. - You'll do fine. [ominous and unsettling electronic music] [switches clicking] [muffled shouting] No, no, stop, stop [gasps]! [eerie electronic music] [echoed shouting] [Gemini gasps] [tense and unsettling electronic music] [computer beeping] - [sighs] The fuck? Hello? - Dale, it's me, you've gotta come out and meet me right away. You remember the spot where we used to hang out? [sighs] You've got to come out right away [sighs], please. - Fuck, man, it's four in the morning! - I need you to do me this one last favor if you were ever my fucking friend, do you understand? Please! - This better be serious. - There's no time for explanations! - All right, give me half an hour. [keyboard clacking] [buzzing and bubbling electronic effects] [tense and ominous ambient music] Noah! [footsteps crunching] [tense and ominous ambient music] What's goin' on with you, why'd you wanna meet all the way out here? - Copper wiring in the walls. The transmission can't be traced here. This entire place is a dead zone. Don't you remember from class? - Why don't you come back, finish, get your degree? - Why? So I can grow up and be like you? - So what have you been doing? - Been collecting things. Transmissions, people's testimony, people who've been damaged. - So what's so urgent, hmm? - I intercepted this one from the Victims Channel. - What's that? [tape snapping] - It's a closed circuit video blog. Victims of psychological torture use it to communicate with each other. People who have been psychologically raped are on that tape, Dale. Do you understand how important that is? [tense electronic music] Thank you for coming. [tense and ominous electronic music] [keyboard clacking] - I could hear his voice. It was almost like about five to 10 people or something like that. All of them kept telling me a whole bunch of different things, like how does it feel to get fucked all the way through your brains. I didn't know whether I was asleep with my eyes closed and, and everybody was talking to me, but they were able to, like, receive this information and take it out and they were also, I felt like they were trying to put in, uh, different, uh, data inside of me that would make me destroy myself. - I would have these weird aura feelings, like this real, really weird, like warm, warmth come over me. It would start with the fingertips, and it would, and also I could feel it go up through my veins all the way up into my head into the back of my eye. I know there is something being completely stolen from me. - Our enemy is a blur. [tense electronic music] I mean [sighs], assignments, I don't trust anybody, really. [traffic whooshing] - Science is unpredictable, but you're the one who pushed it too far. - You didn't tell me she could die from it! - She had AIDS. Her time was limited. I'm sorry about what has happened, but we have to take risks. - No, I'm sorry [sighs]. I don't really feel like I can be a part of this project anymore. - But you agreed. - You can't prove that. - Let me tell you something. I have slept with many of my students with no risk of being reported, no risk at all, because I record the girl telling me how much she wants me. So I have her consent on the tape, like I have yours concerning our project. Our future on this planet is precarious, and yet we have to evolve somehow. To capture the essence of the human being, his mind, his personality, come on, Miles! You worked on the project, you know what I'm talking about! I can make this situation go away. [tense electronic music] But you have to help me. Someone is making threats. It's a former student of mine who had some problems, but I think I have a good idea how to find her. - There's one student, she disappeared, but we're gonna find her using technology we've developed here, and trust me, we're all fully committed. [tense electronic music] [electronics buzzing and whirring] - [Mysterious Woman] But once, in the olden days, they used to, um, cut one arm and then cut one hand, and then they could travel and they could speak to each other by touching that wound. When we actually tested this again, we took our college, uh, student and we took some of his blood, and we had him take a log, what girlfriend, what did he eat, how did he feel, what type of tests did he take, what time did he go to sleep, and for three months, his blood reacted to exactly what was going on with him, exactly. So in the same ways as blood holds electricity and waveforms, they could do the same thing with another person. [tense, vaguely eerie ambient electronic music] - [Mysterious Man] I knew for me it was a new beginning. I felt this power that was nothing like I'd ever felt before. There was nothing that I couldn't accomplish. I could do anything. It filled a hole, a void inside that I had since I was a child, but I still knew that I had to do whatever was asked of me. I was going to find Cheryl, otherwise, who knows what would happen. - [Dale] Another part of the facility, huh? - The way that you see everything. - Yeah, it's cool. - Cameras everywhere. - Yeah. - So tell me, how's your work, tell us. - Yeah, they're very good, I'm excited. I think I'm breaking through some barriers. - Good. Now, do you know what is the meaning of theater? - Uh, live theater, like plays? - [Adam] Yes. - Entertainment? - With theater was born the mask. It hides the face of whoever wears it, his identity, and at the same time, the vibration of the brain, suddenly, this mask reflects their power. As a next assignment, Dale, I want you to wear it. Meet the divine. - [Dale] Uh, thank you, I'm, uh, I'm lookin' forward to this. - Good. - [Dale] All right, yeah, thank you. [traffic whooshing over tense electronic music] [rhythmic electronic music] [phone whoops] - Oh my God, he's on his way. [bird fluttering] [snickers] He looks really cute, I'm excited. I get tired of talkin' to pigeons all the time, you know, guys? As cool as you are, no offense. [rhythmic electronic music] [Jeanie chuckles] Be good, OK, watch the fort. Bye, babies. [traffic humming over quietly tense electronic music] Hey, Dale? Jeanie. - Hi, thanks for coming out. - You're even better looking in person. - So are you, so, you wanna go somewhere? - [Jeanie] Yeah, totally, where do you wanna go? - Um, oh, I figured I'm just kind of a, I'm stressed out, I'm a, I'm a psych student. I've been doin' a lot of studying, you know, so I'm just, uh, a little overwhelmed. - Yeah, man, school's killing me. I'm doing internet marketing. - [Dale] Wow, that sounds heavy. - Yeah, it's a lotta work, a lotta work. - [Dale] So you understand what I'm sayin'? - Totally, hey, do have anything to get high? - [scoffs] Uh, depends on what you get high with. - Uh, well, I'm feelin' like a, a downer, like, um, vikes or oxies or somethin', you know? Somethin' to just chill, chill me out [chuckles]. - Yeah, I've got a bad back, so I, I think I've got 30 milligram oxycodone. - [Jeanie] What? - I do. - Oh, man. - I do. - 30 milli, that's awesome, yes! - It's better than 10. - [chuckles] Yeah, it is! Wow, they look real. - They're real. - Eh, I don't like to take stuff that's, you know, bad for me. - [Dale] Yeah, no, I understand. - [Jeanie] This is cool, this'll just-- - [Dale] Be careful drinking, you know? - Eh, gimme a minute. - There you go. [rhythmic electronic music] So, do you like cam sex? - [scoffs] Sometimes, yeah. - Sometimes, I like masks, you know? Plays out your subconscious, your id. - [Jeanie] Your id? - Desire for love and sex, controlled by your libido, and then the desire for death and aggression. These two competing instincts, you know, build up in the id causing tension, and you gotta release that tension. - [Jeanie] Wow! - You feel me? - [chuckles] I'm all about releasing tension right now. - [Dale] Yeah, absolutely. [engine rumbling] The journey begins. - [Jeanie] I'm excited. So ready, I could fuckin' use a cool change. - [Dale] Oh, it's gonna be cool. [Jeanie laughs] All right, Jeanie, I have something to ask you. - Ask me. - [Dale] How would you feel if you I wanted you to be blindfolded? - Uh-- - [Dale] Would that freak you out? - No, man, that's kinda kinky, I'm into it. - You up for it. - All right, I, I feel like I gotta trust you. You seem, like, you know, kinky. [traffic whooshing] [moans passionately] Yeah, yeah! Oh, yeah [laughs]! [unsettling electronic music] Yeah [moans], yeah! [Jeanie moaning passionately over eerie electronic music] [Jeanie laughs] [Jeanie gasps and moans] [Jeanie chuckles] [Jeanie gasping over eerie electronic music] Yeah [gasps], yeah, oh yeah! [Jeanie gasping and shrieking over eerie electronic music] [eerie ambient tones] [Dale grunting aggressively] [Dale gasping] [eerie and unsettling electronic music] [machinery whirring] [Tristan sighs] [Tristan grunts] [ominous ambient music] [Tristan grunts] [Tristan sighs] [zipper crunching] [Tristan sighs] [doors crunching shut] [ominous ambient music] [engine rumbling] [ominous and eerie ambient music] - Dale! - I saw that tape, it made me sick, man. - C'mere. Look at my eye. Here, right by the pupil, look. - There's nothing in your eye. - I know. - [Dale] Just, what are talking about? - Shh, shh! - All right. - Just look, right there. - [Dale] All right, listen, listen. - Just look! - Listen, you've been awake too long. Look, there's nothing in your eye! I promise you, there's nothing in your eye. [tense and ominous ambient music] - I am getting, like, tension, tension headaches in the frontal part of my lobe [sighs]. Shh, swelling pressure. [tense ambient music] Yeah, yeah, uh [sighs], [tense ambient music] [sighs] I found him. - Hey, look, let me see what I can find out, OK? You're fine, all right? [Noah sighs] It's all in your head. [ominous and tense ambient music] - Thanks. [footsteps clacking] [switch clacking] [eerie and unsettling ambient electronic music] [keyboard clacking] - [clears throat] They're constantly making new things to make the cellphone invaluable, that you can't do anything without it. I remember I was bleeding from under my nails, so I electrocuted myself. I'd been on the phone a lot, and I started thinking these crazy thoughts like is it, is it the phone I've been holding to this side of my head, and is it doing something to me, like. [ominous and eerie ambient electronic music] - You're a victim. You were his victim, he's sick, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for my sicknesses. [eerie and ominous ambient electronic music] - [Computerized Voice] Preview and identification completed. [door rattling] [electronics buzzing over ominous ambient music] - Go on, keep working. - [Tristan] OK. [keyboard clacking] - [Adam] You found anything? - No, there's been a lotta action, just, uh, none that you might be looking for [sighs]. - Well, then work harder. I'll come check with you tomorrow. - Listen, you don't have to obsess so hard, sir. I've got the data, and I'm analyzing it with, with all the records we have. I mean, if I find a match, I'll tell you. - I don't like to repeat myself. [electronics buzzing over ominous and tense ambient music] Good night, Tristan. [electronics buzzing over unsettling ambient music] - Fuck! [ominous and unsettling rumbling ambient tones] - You've got the sensitivities to psychological disorders. It creates an obscenity in electromagnetic radiation, the EMR. [whirring electronic music over muffled dialog] Concentrated exposure can, can lead to heart irregularities and cancer, brain tumors, just look. It can actually alter your, your, your DNA. I mean restructure, essentially, uh, rewire the human genome. This information was to be made available at any cost. [lighter snapping] - These people are like a family to me! Don't you understand that, don't you understand that? They were like a family to me! You know how important that is, that's all I ever wanted! Maybe you don't care, maybe you don't, but that's all I ever wanted! Can't you guys both respect that? Shut up, shut up, you pussy! You'd be suckin' dick if it wasn't for me, wouldn't you, wouldn't you? If it were up to you, we'd be serial killers? That's not the point, you understand what type of position we're in right now, right? Fuck you! What, do you wanna hit me, do you want me to hit you? Don't touch him, leave him alone. Fuckin' put your finger on my face, put me up one more time! [gun clicking] Stop it, just calm down. Leave him alone, just calm down! OK, do you agree that I'm the voice of reason here? I'm trying, didn't I just try, right? We have got an open mind, all of us. We've gotta listen to each other and understand where each one is coming from. Everyone here is trying to make sense. If you just would listen to him, I will listen to you, and you listen to me, we have a chance! Help me out, man! I understand, I respect you, just help me out, man, please! The funny thing is I'm talkin' to nobody! [eerie and ominous ambient music] - [Tristan] Whitney keeps classified files of the students who've been part of the program, and the files go back for years. He, he keeps old cellphones around. I mean, why would he keep this old, outdated technology around, is, is, I, I think it might have something to do with the frequency of the phone, can't be duplicated 'cause it's a crystal and every phone crystal is different. [drawer snaps] [electronics buzzing] [low throbbing ambient tones] - You find something? - Not yet, nope. I don't [sighs], I don't know what it is. - And did you do everything I told you? - I injected them with the dye, and then I did everything the way you showed me. - Well, then, I'll have to come back again tomorrow. Oh, by the way, did you get the order? - Oh, yeah, came in this morning. [box rattling] 1000 pills of ketamine. Enough to stop a herd of elephants there. [box rattling over buzzing electronics] - I'll see you tomorrow. - Oh, hey, I was, I was thinking, could, could I maybe, could I maybe get one of those? [box rattling] [pills rattling] - Accomplishment. - Thanks. [bottle thwacks] [electronics buzzing over low rumbling ambient tones] I got you. [phone buzzing] [keypad thwacking] [camera snaps] - That was a very intense conversation in class. I didn't wanna leave, I wanted to stay. [eerie and tense ambient music] - How can you swallow the shit that they're feeding us in there? - What do you mean? I think you've got it all wrong. [eerie and tense ambient music] - I'm outta here, for good. - You can't leave. - Yeah, right? - [Dale] Hey, Kamal! - I'm out, you got it under control. [ominous and eerie ambient electronic music] [muffled chatter over eerie, unsettling ambient music] [phone chirping] Hello? [modem buzzing and whirring] [static crackling] [unsettling throbbing ambient tones] [Tristan sighs] [unsettling throbbing ambient tones] [gloves thwacking] [Tristan sighs] [phone clacking] [eerie ambient music] [door alarm dinging] [engine rumbling] [echoing rock guitar over jangling electronic tones] [rhythmic electro rock music] [eerie and unsettling electronic accent] - Hey, you people just have this need to manipulate and control other people. That's really sick. Yeah, only you're not any healthier than anybody else, none of you. I think you're all really sicker than most human beings . You're really sick people. [buzzing and whirring electronic tones] [low, throbbing ambient tones] [ominous and eerie electronic tones] [bell clanging] [swell of ominous and unsettling electronic music] [Tristan gags] [ominous and unsettling electronic music] [Tristan coughing and gagging] [Tristan gasping and coughing] [Tristan groaning over rattling ignition] - [Tristan] [gasps] Fuck! [Tristan coughing] [Tristan gasping and grunting over tense ambient music] [Tristan gasping for breath] [Tristan grunting over rattling ignition] Dammit! [Tristan gasping and grunting] [train whistle wailing] [train whirring on tracks over dinging alarm bell] - I got into a car accident, and some people helped me before the ambulance got there. I don't know, they were, like, some other kind of ambulance, and once I, at the hospital, I don't know exactly when, what happened to me, I mean, they say that they stick their finger up your, uh, anus to, for reflex, um, but I don't know, sometimes I wonder if maybe they did stick something, um, in there. Some kind of, uh, chip or something, 'cause after the car accident, I felt like I had to be reborn again. - [scoffs] This is the only place that's safe. There's no wires that are above me that are not grounded to the dirt. The dirt keeps, keeps the arc from coming off of their power lines and shooting through, I mean, I've seen, I've seen the television completely off. [mimics electrical buzz] Go right, right out and turn white. It, it doesn't matter, it doesn't even have to be plugged in. They can, they can, they can make a, a cellphone explode next to your head. [unsettling guitar accents] If you're listening to this, you know that I need your help. They're trying to fucking kill me with invisible waveforms. Get all of the incriminating data from the tests and the people who've been tested on and the ones that are still out there. I have it all back up into the cloud, but if I were to die, which is very likely, I have it all encapsulated, uh, titanium flash drive. [eerie and unsettling ambient music] [door rattling] [gun clicks] [lock clacking] - [Cheryl] You don't understand anything about me, I mean, [sniveling] you don't understand how much you hurt me. I know you don't want [sighs]-- [hatch thuds] [lock clacking] [low rumbling ambient tones] [eerie and unsettling ambient music] [footsteps clacking over eerie ambient music] [switches snapping] [eerie pulsing ambient tones] - Genesis 9:17. God said unto Noah, "This is the token of the covenant "which I have established between me "and all the flesh that is upon the earth." [unsettling ambient music] [woman gasps] [woman shrieks] [woman thuds to the ground] - [Woman] No, please [gasps]! [strikes thudding] [strikes cracking] [woman coughing and gagging] [switches snapping] [distant dogs barking over eerie ambient tones] - Fuck, [muttering]! Fuck! It's not my, fuck [gasps]! [eerie and unsettling ambient music] [low rumbling ambient tones] [traffic humming] [eerie and unsettling ambient music] - What's that on your head? [strap snapping] - Protects me from the transmissions. They're coming for me. [gasping] They're coming for me, aren't they? - I haven't heard anything like that. - No. The great and glorious science, are you proud of what you've accomplished? - What do you mean? Somebody's gotta infiltrate, see what's going on. You're certainly not doin' it, Noah. Somebody's gotta be on the inside. - On the inside, they are on the inside of you. - What the fuck are you talking about, they're on the inside of me? Let me ask you something. Do you think you can take them on on your own, huh? You need me as much as I need you. - Did you find out what it's like when they're done using you? They'll tell you what to do, because there's no getting away. Not in this pathetic life. You gotta trust somebody. [buzzing electronic tones over unsettling ambient music] If anything happens to me, anything, I'm gonna put a special package for you right here. - [Dale] What are you talking about, Noah? - This is everything I've collected so far, do you get it? This is all the tapes, my tapes, the victims' tapes, this is my life, and I am giving it to you. - [Dale] If something happens to me, what do you want me to do? [tense, pulsing electronic music] - If that time ever comes, [scoffs] look inside the briefcase. You're gonna find some information. Follow the instructions exactly then destroy any extra copies to make sure that the feds don't get them, do you understand me, Dale? - Yeah, if that time comes, you can trust in me. - How long have we known each other? - [Dale] Long time, why? - Remember I was so idealistic that I, now you're working on secret patents and I'm doing, well, this shit. [eerie electronic music] We're still friends, right? - Yeah, of course we're friends. We'll always be close. - All right. [slaps thwacking over eerie ambient music] Just remember this spot, OK? - Of course. [tense and eerie ambient music] [crickets chirping over rumbling ambient tones] [door rattling] [eerie, unsettling ambient music] [skittering electronic accent] [woman gasps] [skittering and screeching electronic tones] [punches thwacking] [skittering and screeching electronic tones] [whooshing electronic effects] [Noah gasps] [switches clicking] [Dale coughing and retching] [toilet flushing] [Dale gasps] [metal clanging] I'm scared. I didn't realize that Whitney was manipulating us. I just want to stay in control [gasps]. [gun cocking] [Dale gasping] I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I can't take it back now. [Dale sniveling] [distant traffic humming] [insects chirping over rumbling ambient tones] - [Tristan] Who's out there? Show your fucking self! - [Hooded Man] I can't show you who I am! - I'm gonna fry your fucking brain with waveforms! Let me see your face! - [Hooded Man] I'm an administrator for the Victims Channel. I can't show you my face, I have to be anonymous. - Blog dude from the, from the Victims Channel? Show me that you're unarmed. [ominous ambient music] Turn your fucking camera on all of this. You, you need to process all of this! This is where, this is where they test it on the victims, [grunting] all the tapes, everything comes from here! You gotta be quick, though, we gotta hurry! [insects chirping over ominous ambient music] Are you ready to hear this? - [Victims Channel Rep] Just tell your story. - The test started off with whenever we get a person who came into the psychiatric part of the school. We would, um, first inject them with this dye, I thought it was a dye, which later on, I come to find out is a, some kind of nanotechnology liquid that's not even classified to use on people, but it makes it so we can see how the synapses of the brain are, are communicating with that part of the body at that moment. The ultimate goal is to create a weapon that doesn't even kill people but, it can wipe out massive amounts of, of, of brain frequency and basically turn people into sheep. [rhythmic and eerie electronic music] [eerie and ominous ambient music] [swell of tense electronic music] - [Cheryl] The day I met you in the library. I, I really did like you. Wow. - Adam Whitney, I wrote this book. - Cheryl. I was so stupid to think you were a nice person. You know, I thought we could get along, but if you didn't want me, you should've just let me go. [button clicks] - They've tapped into the, the whole grid where if she comes within any of those cameras, and we, we get glimpses of her, and we can pick up on her waveform, but then she's gone. If somehow they're able to, uh, find her frequency or whatever it is that's leaving the messages, then more people are gonna die. I mean, there's no evidence the, that the woman is real. She could just be some cloud just drifting through the wires, through the fiberoptics, and, and, and theoretically, she could be implanted into someone else's mind, and I think that that's what he's the most afraid of. If, if, if this doesn't get out, more people will be missing, you know? More tests'll be done, but people don't know that. That's the-- [muffled rustling] - [Victims Channel Rep] Who is that? - Come on! [tense electronic music] [tense electronic music with unsettling buzzing tones] [rhythmic and tense electronic music] [footsteps thudding] [rhythmic and tense electronic music] [muffled rattling] [rhythmic and tense electronic music] [footsteps thudding over tense electronic music] [muffled rattling] [footsteps and rattling over tense electronic music] [glass shattering] [tense electronic music with unsettling buzzing tones] [ominous and tense electronic music] C'mon, c'mon, down here, down! Get in here! [ominous and tense electronic music] - Fuck! [ominous electronic music] [object thwacking on trailer] Son of a bitch! [rhythmic and tense electronic music] [engine rumbling over tense electronic music] [men gasping over tense electronic music] [rhythmic and tense electronic music] [echoing shouts over tense electronic music] [van creaking] [men grunting] [Tristan sighs] - [Victims Channel Rep] Come on! [ignition rattling] - I'm gonna take you to the medical facility. It's, it's close to here. [engine rumbling] God! [engine rumbling over tense ambient music] I'm gonna give you something. During admissions, everyone that was admitted to the school signed a waiver releasing their lives. I cannot give this chip to you without seeing your face, I have to see your face! I have to know who, who's, who's hands these peoples' lives are in. [tense electronic music] Take it, their DNA code, everything! Their lives are on that. [ominous and tense electronic music] See the light up there on the third floor? Up above this bridge? - [Victims Channel Rep] Yeah. - You're gonna go to the third floor. Whitney's retina scan is on that chip. It'll give you complete access to anywhere in the system. - [Victims Channel Rep] All right, I'll get what I can. - Use the code that I gave you. [engine rumbling over eerie ambient music] [door crunching] [engine rumbling] [eerie ambient music] There's somehow, let everybody know that there's machines that are controlling, uh, all of the synapses in, in our minds. Everything we do, they know we're gonna do it before we do it. It's like he's waitin' behind you at the gas station, but what is he doin'? He's not buying anything, you know? Heh, and then you go and wait behind him. He looks at you like you're fuckin' crazy, but you're not! [engine rumbling over eerie and ominous ambient music] [door creaking] [door crunching] [traffic whooshing over eerie and ominous ambient music] [ominous and menacing ambient electronic music] [train screeching over ominous ambient music] [alarm dings] [muffled PA chatter over ominous ambient music] [eerie and ominous ambient music] [doors rattling] [eerie ambient music] [buzzing electronic tones over eerie ambient music] [Tristan groaning over buzzing electronic tones] [eerie and ominous electronic music] [buzzing electronic tones] [train whirring] - [PA Announcer] Now arriving Vermont/Santa Monica Station. Exit here for Los Angeles City College. [rumbling ambient tones] Stand clear, the doors are closing. [footsteps clacking] [ominous rumbling ambient tones] [eerie and ominous ambient music] - I read this thing recently about the dinosaurs becoming extinct is because they found this iridium that was along the, it was all along the fossils, that it's not found, like, on Earth. It's, like, they find it in outer space, yeah, so they found that, like, the earth, there must've been these meteorites or something coming from outer space that made the, that eradicated the dinosaurs. - Yeah, that's their life, you know that. - So, I really like this part here that she has to say. This chapter about how to make experiments with biological transmutation successful. Like, that's really interesting, it's, like, one-of-a-kind research. - You know, it's just research. Two plus two equals four. - It's kind of cold in here. Do you maybe wanna get out of here, maybe go to my place for a drink? - Very sweet, but I can't, I can't. I have to go back to the project. It takes all of my free time. - Maybe I could come with you? I'd really like to see what you've been working on. - [Adam] You sure? [rhythmic electro rock music] - [Cheryl] Yeah, I'm totally sure, I'd really like to go. - OK, let's pick up my car. - [Cheryl] Mm-hmm. [rhythmic electro rock music] [traffic whooshing] [eerie and ominous ambient music] - [Computerized Voice] Preview and identification completed. - [Cheryl] Wow, this place is amazing! - My lab, and I'm proud of it. - So, Adam, do you have any children? - I always dream of having a family, but you know how it is once you get married. 50 percent of your time for the wife, 50 percent of your time for the kids, another 50 percent for the career, what's left? So I focus on my work, and in some ways, my students are my children. [door rattling over ominous ambient music] What you are about to see I shouldn't really show to nobody. You understand that? - Yeah, you make me feel special. - Here, here we see the cutting edge of mind technology. Nobody's authorized to do this but me. Everything here, all the labs, the whole project is being financed by the government. There are special parts of this program that I have to do separate from the school so that there is no interference. - What is this place? - It's OK, I'm the only one to use it. To tell you the truth, I really need your help. - What do you mean? - I have to record a human waveform. - You mean the bioplasma? - Yes, exactly! And I need someone as dedicated as I am to be able to analyze it completely. - What do you need me to do? [ominous ambient music] - [lips smacking] Trust me. [eerie and ominous ambient music] [buttons snapping] [buzzing electrical hum] [eerie and ominous electronic music] [Cheryl gasps] [tense electronic music with unsettling gurgling accents] [computer buzzing over eerie pulsing ambient music] [static crackling] - If this gets in the wrong people's hands, we're fucked! Do you get it, fucked! Chill out. It's getting people's mind, their souls! Am I the only one here who wants to live, guys? I wanna live! Come on, I know, we had no father, I get it! Where's all this hate coming from? We had nothing! Where did this come from? Talk to him! Will you please let me talk? I'm gonna end up killing myself, can you please help me out, Dale, please? You're everything that I never wanted to be, OK? He fucking used you man! Ask him when we talk. That's the whole reason that we're even in this mess! Does anyone here understand me? It's not about pers, Dale, it's not about personal issues! Can't you understand that? Can't you understand that? What the hell is wrong with you? We all need each other, you need me, you need me, we need each other, Dale! Do you guys understand right now, single-handedly, we're the most powerful group of people in the world, and if you guys were with me, we could be unstoppable! OK, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to be somebody that I'm not? What do you want me to do? I want you to get every message, every testimonial, every bit of data, every CD, every incriminating evidence that we possible could have and destroy it, now! [objects thwacking on counter] [eerie, vaguely unsettling ambient music] [plastic snapping over quietly tense ambient music] [CD cracking] [eerie electronic music over rhythmic percussion] [plastic rattling] [eerie electronic music over rhythmic percussion] [eerie, gurgling ambient music with jangling guitar] [phone thwacking] [eerie and ominous ambient music] - [Adam] I believe you are ready for the next level. - I'm so glad I could help you. - I thank you, darling. [footsteps clacking over eerie ambient music] [electronics buzzing and whirring] [eerie throbbing electronic tones] [Cheryl gasping and groaning over unsettling ambiance] [throbbing and pulsing electronic tones] [pulsing and whirring electronic tones] [eerie and ominous ambient music] Fuck! [eerie and ominous ambient music] - [Mysterious Man] For all the women that Whitney had abused, she was the anomaly. [shuddering percussion accent] The second law of thermodynamics says that entropy, the random disorder of energy and matter in a system, always increases with time. It's as if whenever she goes through the wires, her waveform is amplified, and then could show up anywhere at anytime. [muffled rattling] [eerie buzzing electronic tones] [footsteps thudding] [eerie pulsing electronic music] [electronics buzzing and whirring] [buttons snapping] [eerie pulsing and whirring electronic music] [pulsing electronic tones over unsettling ambient music] - Seem to think because you're a psychologist that you know more about how to live life than I do, but I don't play these kinds of sick, psychotic games with other people's heads, do I? No, see, you people just have this need to manipulate and control other people, that's really sick. You know, and you're not any healthier than anybody else. None of you, I think you're all really sicker than most human beings. You're really sick people. [static crackling] [pulsing electronic tones over rumbling ambiance] [ominous and eerie ambient music] I call, suppose I call the police, and you deserve for me to turn you in. I shoulda turned you in a long time ago 'cause what you did to me was wrong. You were sexually harassing me, I'm sorry, that's exactly what it was. Regardless of whether I went with it or how I felt about you, that's exactly what it was, OK, but don't rub my nose in it, 'cause I covered up for you, you fuckin' prick! [eerie screeching electronic music] [muffled shrieking and gasping] - [Cheryl] [sobs] No [gasping]! [Cheryl whimpering] - You're coming with me. [eerie and ominous ambient music] - [Man With Mask] Adopted children and children in placements are, uh, prime targets. You can get a child out of a placement, mind control it, and then bring it back. Nobody knows the difference, so later on in life, when they need to fast-track somebody, they use these people that they've mind controlled earlier in their life when they were young. - Do you guys realize that if we get caught, we're going to prison forever! I'd rather be dead. Fuckin' A, man, we gotta pull this together! I'd definitely rather you be dead! This should've been decided an hour ago, am I right? Listen, you listen, everybody in the world, every person is different. Everybody has a different purpose, everyone has a different reason. I'm already dead, guys! OK, guys, let's come together! You, you, let's come together, look at me! Look at me, look at me, let's pull it together, OK? Are you with me, huh? We can do it, you can do it, come on! Yeah, it's the best idea I've ever heard, let's go. Right now, let's fuckin' do it! [metal creaking] [computer buzzing over eerie pulsing ambient music] [muffled rattling] [buzzing alarm tones] [static crackling] [insects chirping over eerie and ominous ambient music] [gun rattling] - Look at who I am, look at me now! - Neither of us knew what could happen. - You were always the expert! You knew this could happen to me! [gunshots cracking] [insects chirping] [static buzzing] You didn't kill me, 'cause I'm already dead! [gun rattling] [tense ambient electronic music] - [Miles] You like to torture people! - [Adam] What? - You like to study pain! - [Adam] Hey, hey, hey, I-I-I didn't, I don't want to hurt nobody! Stop, stop, stop it, stop it. Come on, come on! - And neither did I. [engine rumbling over tense ambient electronic music] [gun cocking] [car door crunching] [gate clanging] [tense ambient music] - Look, look, you don't understand. I was just trying to purify their souls for our experiment, you know that! I am not a bad person. - Maybe I'm a bad person. [gunshot cracking] It's only when we're close to death that our minds are-- - Please, please, please don't, don't shoot! I-I'm, please, no-no, please! - Don't, don't what? [gunshot cracking] - No, no, no, no! [Adam groans] [gasping] Wait [gasps], wait! Wait [gasps], you did it [gasping]. Cheryl did, it worked, it worked! [gun clicking] They're gonna come after us, they're gonna find out everything about us! They're gonna find out everything! - I burned all my files, Dale. I suggest you do the same. [gun rattling] [distant siren blaring] - [Dale] What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you! - See ya around. [Dale gasping over eerie and ominous ambient music] [tense pulsing electronic music] [keyboard clacking] [tense pulsing electronic music] [electronic buzzing] [tense pulsing electronic music] - I was embarrassed in front of a bunch of people. I looked like a goddamn fool, and I don't know why because I didn't do anything to you. Maybe you're just sadistic. You ruined my life. [buzzing electronic tones] [buzzing and skittering electronic tones] [buzzing electronic tones over clattering percussion] - Preserve it, man, preserve it for us! Preserve for it for the fucking guinea pigs who've been psychologically raped, day in, day out. [gasps] My frequency's unknown, man. Please. - [Mysterious Woman] There is a theory that there is an entity that created all electroneurologic field of information. It could actually create holograms, become entities in front of your face. Call you up on the telephone, replicate any voice pattern, whether they be your friends or parents. They can have complete control of all your computers. You can't get away from it. [ominous ambient music] [footsteps clacking over ominous ambient music] [ominous and eerie ambient music] [traffic humming over eerie ambient music] [Tristan coughing] [traffic whooshing] [traffic whooshing over tense electronic music] - [Tristan] Gotta listen now, everybody! They're stalking us, Victims Channel! [wheelchair rattling] [groans] Shit [groans]! [Tristan gasping] I gotta get back up, OK. It's not too late, gotta listen to me! Listen to me! [traffic humming over ominous ambient music] [ominous ambient music] - [Cheryl] My phone is disconnected. Did you want to see me, you know where I am, goodbye. [Cheryl laughing over ominous ambient music] [phone line crunching] [ominous and eerie ambient electronic music] [rhythmic and unsettling electronic music with murky bass]
