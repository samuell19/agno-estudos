If they saw you, the funeral's on me. Fairer than that, I can't be. -That the place? -Hey, don't point! You got good skin tone. [LAUGHS] I'll be right back. I ain't saying it's the right kid. But he matches the info you gave me. Looks like your typical runaway. I know they've been using him for their bag runs. Well, what's the rush? Just wait here. Hey, there are two of them up there. Each one, three times your size. Hey, just relax, man. -Just relax. -Hey, hey-- Watch my back. -How you doing, baby? -Alright. You know your friend's dead? Oh, no. He's just rehearsing for the school play. He's Tinkerbell. He's gotta stay like that till all the kids in the audience clap. -What's your name? -Whatever you want it to be. -Okay. Esmerelda. -That's me. He ain't part of this. No, I just need your body. Surprises never cease. Come on. Oh, no. This way. Take five minutes. Five minutes? Did you just get out of jail or something? [♪♪♪] OCHOA: Go, Moondoggie! Shoot that curl. Hey, what are you doing, brewing and bottling it in there or what? Moondoggie's fixing to kick some butt here. Hey, watch the crap! Watch this crap! Will you get me another one? OCHOA: Whoo. Hey, you know, this guy, -Bobby Darin, what an actor. -[KNOCKING ON DOOR] [RACKS SHOTGUN] [♪♪♪] Get over here. [GROANS] Are you sure nobody followed you back here? Yeah, I'm sure. Look, I did what you said. I picked up the bag, and then I went through the alley. Shut up. Get back. It's one of them tricks from downstairs. A hot-looking one. Yeah, I think she's at the wrong apartment. [BOTH LAUGH] Maybe we don't tell her she's got the wrong place till later. [BOBBY DARIN SINGS ON TV] Look a little different through the peephole, don't I? James Darren! Whatever happened to that guy? It's Bobby Darin, you moron! -It's James Darren. -Bobby Darin! Shut up! Who the hell are you and what are you doing here? MAN ON TV: We'll be right back with James Darren inGidget Goes Hawaiian. [TV OFF] -The broad's gone. -I came for the kid. -You know him? -No. -Don't lie to me! -He's not lying to you. Missed. That's one. What do you want with my kid? Oh, yeah, sure. He's your kid and I'm the Cat in the Hat. You guys have been forcing him to pick up and drop off drugs and money. He's pretty much slave labor, and you guys are pretty much, what, kidnappers? And I'm gonna pretty much walk outta here with him, and you can go back to watching Gidget Does Hawaii. See how easy life can be? -That's two. -OCHOA: Oh, yeah? And what happens when you get to three, pal? Are you gonna turn into Superman, huh? 'Cause that's what you're gonna have to do if you're gonna kick our butts. You don't wanna know about three. Besides, I got strict orders from my doctor not to touch anybody. What, do you got some kind of deadly disease or something? No. I am some kind of deadly disease. I have always wanted to say something like that. -[CHUCKLES] -Well, here's your chance, brother. -Because here comes three. -[GUN RACKS] [♪♪♪] [FIGHTING SOUNDS] [SCREAMS] What'd I tell ya about three? You're dead, brother. You ain't my brother. [♪♪♪] So, how long ago did you run away? Uh, it's been two weeks. Two weeks on Wednesday. Why, what's it to you? Well, I don't know how bad it was at home, but it couldn't be much worse than this. -Yo, Esmerelda. -Sorry. So, where did you learn all that stuff up there? Places like this. Here, he's yours. Not till he's three years older. No, no, no. Make sure he gets home. There's enough there for cabs, to grab a bite, and the rest is for your time. Did you come here for me? Who sent you? Not my old man. I was looking for someone else. Well, what about me? Not unless you got a birthmark right about there. Sorry, man. Adios. Adios. Call again. We're in the book. See ya. [GROANS] Thanks for waiting. See how easy life can be? [ENGINE STARTS] SENSEI: First, you must recognize evil. Then, you must combat it. Finally, you must guard against becoming evil yourself. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Suzy, tell Jonathon to come up to my office now, please. [♪♪♪] -Hey. -The boss wants to see you. Can't this wait till after closing? He said now. [♪♪♪] Maybe he figures you're busy later. Besides, never put off till later what you can do now. You know, you're stereotyping yourself when you start talking like a fortune cookie. Yeah, but fortune cookies are Chinese. -I'm only part Chinese. -Yeah, but which part? -[KNOCKING] -Enter. Come on. [SIGHS] So, what do you think? I'm hitting the mainland. Club Tokyo wherever you want. I'm even thinking about going public, too. There'll be great stock opportunities for certain key employees, capiche? Providing they stay key employees. Now, what's the matter with you, Jon? I thought we were goombahs? I love it when you talk like De Niro. Bubbeh, this is Kenny you're talking to. Now, I may be your boss, but we're still pals, right? So, how come I gotta hear on the street that my key man has himself a problem he won't come to me about? I didn't realize my problems were on the street. [SCOFFS] These islands are like small towns, Jon. And the nightclub circuit is a lightning rod for any kind of rumor or otherwise. Besides, Suzy mentioned a couple of months after you started that you were asking around for, uh, whoever this kid is you're looking for. An Asian kid, right? I mean, is that why you're so desperate to get a job at a club that caters to Asians? It doesn't matter, 'cause I was giving my notice today anyway. Whoa, wait! That's not what I want. I don't want to make you uncomfortable or pressured. Hey, I just want to help. I got a lot of connections here. I assume that this kid is a friend or a relative of a friend, right? He's my son. Your son? You have a son. I take it, uh, you're trying to locate him. What, the mother and he split? She's dead. Not a subject I wanna get into. No problem, no problem, I-- Like I said, I don't want to pry. I just wanna help. Thanks. I appreciate your concern. But you're still going, huh? I'm still... looking. Whatever you gotta do. Take your time, or stay a little longer, whatever. Remember, you're my number one haole here. I'm your only haole here. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Don't knock it. It works for the clientele. [CHUCKLES] Hey, listen. I'll talk with you later after closing, alright? [♪♪♪] Hey, Sandy, how come you're not working my station? That's alright. I won't take it personally. [♪♪♪] [MUSIC FADES] [KENNY GROANS] OSATO: Pull a gun on your own cousin? Oh, Hiroshi? [GRUNTS] I thought I was gonna be mugged. If the Yakuza are to survive the year 2000, they must look to expand our base of operations. Is that not why your father dispatched you here -before his death? -No. No, he knew I was building a club. This is mine. This was never clan business. Everything you own belongs to the Tanaka Clan. Your illustrious father, founder of the Tanaka clan, is responsible for everything you are. You think because of his death you are no longer in his debt? My father always knew I would not involve myself. Could not be involved! You spineless, grifting jellyfish. You have disgraced your father's name, and to the clan, the strongest of the Yakuza.

It's my dad, right? You work with my dad? Please, Jonathon, it would be better if-- Is it bad? Where's my mom? I'm sorry, but it's both of them. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] JONATHON: I knew my father worked for INTERPOL. Fighting the drug trafficking of the Yakuza clan, sensei. Jonathon, I am not your sensei this day. Today, I am simply... an old friend of your father and mother. I will try to honor their memory and guide you. Although the Yakuza ordered the death of your father, it was the Black Dragon who carried out this terrible act. Black Dragon? Sensei... I've heard some of the other students talk. Perhaps, you like legend? Legend is not always myth, Jonathon. Outside of Japan, there is almost nothing known about the Black Dragon. He is utterly secret, and jealously guarded. The art is an ancient one. It's origins are cloudy, and there is an element of superstition involved. How does one become a Black Dragon? You mean, how do you become a Black Dragon. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [MUSIC ENDS ABRUPTLY] [WATERFALL FLOWING] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [WOMAN SCREAMS] [WOMAN PANTING] You scared-- The clothes off you. Yeah. I should be more frightening next time, see what else I can frighten you out of. It's the first. It's rent day. I thought you'd be expecting me. Or have you turned deadbeat? You know, I don't have to come over here anymore and pick up your rent personally. Maybe you should just leave it at the realty office like everyone else. I'm probably not gonna be spending much time here anymore. I'm giving you my notice. Do you know how I had to work my butt off to find you this place with all your requirements, including that garden out there? Do you know how many tenants Mr. Kishikawa had me evict because they didn't take care of the garden properly? And you're required to give a 30-day notice. [♪♪♪] What if I give you an extra month's rent? Well, I'd hate for you to have to do that Perhaps, we can work something out. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] JONATHON: Tamiko? [♪♪♪] JONATHON: I think it's time we talked about Larry, Moe, Curly from last night, don't you? KENNY: The Yakuza... I'm sure you know all about them. Well, I'm sure you know a lot about other things too based on what I saw you do last night. Japanese gangsters, not unlike the Sicilian mafia or its American counterpart. That's right, and like the mafia, the only way to get out -is to die. -Get out? You're not exactly Yakuza material, Kenny. I'm sorry to tell you. Well, you see, Jon, my father was an oyabun. Leader of a Yakuza clan. The Tanaka Gumi of Japan, you're with them? Yeah. Jon, my father was a great man. He understood that much of the Yakuza was still deeply rooted into the past. That's not to say he didn't believe in heritage and birthright, but he knew that his son.... [CHUCKLES] It wasn't his karma to go into the ranks of a criminal organization. But others do not agree? You got it. They don't. When my father died, my cousin, Hiroshi Osato, took over as oyabun. He's been trying for years to get me back into the fold, so to speak. You see, he, um... he despises my... my Western outlook. Well, I'll agree with him. You do have that. But what does he wish to accomplish by sending those three men last night? That was Osato last night. he hopes to use my club and my connections with Tokyo. They think that I would be a good trading post, so to speak, a--a waystation to import the drugs, then distribute through my club in Honolulu. Then, eventually, into the one in New York. Not to state the obvious, but that little game of tag last night is not gonna stop them from coming at you again. Well, at least you delayed them a bit. Yeah, for a day maybe. What, you'd prefer to die on Saturday instead of Friday, huh? A day is all I'll need. As long as I have time to get my daughter away to safety. See, she's arriving today from Switzerland. And I know that's gonna be their next move to pressure me. They're still gonna come directly at you. Doesn't matter. As long as Kim is safe. [MAN SNORING] [TELEPHONE RINGS] [SNORTING] [RINGING CONTINUES] [COUGHS] Jablonski, security analyst, with offices in London, Paris, and New York. Your call has been rerouted to our main offices in... [HACKING] -...Tulsa. -Ski, it's Jon. Jonathon, I hope this call is good 'un. My gut told me that that lead I turned in San Francisco was a live one. Well, did you find your boy? Do I have the guns on ya? Oh, no, it was definitely the right trail. Well, I thought I was close until yesterday, but, um, I'm calling you because, um, I need you to do something for me. -You game? -Well, I'd drop my whole case load for you. But right now I'm, uh, I'm trying to return a runaway wife to the bosom of her family. Uh, after that, I'm yours. How's the booze? I ain't had a drink in, uh... ten hours. You just woke up. [COUGHING] What are you, one of them genius idiot savants? Believe me, I'm off the stuff as of now. Is this personal, or is there cash involved? Not that money'd ever come between us. I'll tell ya what, I'll wire the money to the Tulsa Airport. Okay? Tickets'll be in your name, and where to meet me when you get here. Does it matter where "here" is? Ha-vaii. Hawaii! You mean where they got them drinks that have pretty little umbrellas? I've seen them. Jonathon, you sound nervous. Nothing makes me more nervous than something that makes you nervous. See ya. I'll see ya. [COUGHS] I wonder if I'm gettin' an ulcer. [SHOWER RUNNING] I just wanted to make sure you weren't a guy. Oh, no. You made pretty sure last night. Well, darlin', I got another case hanging fire. You go straight home now, Celia. And tell your husband not to forget the check. I had a really good time. Yeah. So did I. [RETCHING] [♪♪♪] [BIRDS SINGING] No! Wait, Jon! I love you for what you're doing Why--why are you gonna get yourself killed for someone you know for only four months? The game plan is, hopefully, not to get killed. Besides, I thought we were bubbehs and goombahs. And your club is the best-paying job I ever had. I'm serious, Jon. You saved my life. You patched me up. You're willing not to call the police. And for sure you're now on Osato's hit parade. My God! I've got you involved with the Yakuza, for crying sakes! I mean, you should be wanting to go to the police. I can't go to the police. For my own reasons. As for messing with the Yakuza, I've been there before. You have? With the Yakuza? Does this have anything to do with your son and his being part Japanese? Jon, all the more reason-- What are you gonna do if they found out about your daughter's arrival? Take on the Yakuza with your arm tied behind your back? Think again. You got a picture? Yeah. Yeah, here. Okay. Don't answer the phone, the door, and don't call into to work to let them know the night you'll be there. Yeah, but Suz will wonder. I mean, she'll think something's wrong. Something is wrong. [ENGINE STARTS] If I'm not back in two hours, call the president. WOMAN: Now, I do know that this is the closest thing to what you've been looking for. It's beautiful here, isn't it? This could be your everyday life. Hopefully, I'll talk with you soon. You take this with you. Bye-bye. [SIGHS] [APPLAUSE] Bravo. "This could be your everyday life"? -What are you doing here? -I called your office. They said you were showing a place. I know all your moves, so... I thought you were leaving. I need another place. Nothing fancy, but private. No neighbors. Well, I haven't been to the office yet, so I haven't canceled your other rental. No, this is for a friend. Female? Not that I'd care, but whoever she is, I hate her. And I need it today. Now, within the next couple of hours. Now, just because you've enjoyed some of my personal attention does not mean that I've jettisoned my professional ethics. Besides, I have to show this place until five. -How much vacation time do you have? -What? About three weeks. Take it. Call the office, say you're gonna take a couple weeks off. You have a sick aunt or a Pomeranian or something to take care of. And since I don't have a sick aunt or a Pomeranian, what would I be doing these three weeks. Well, if your passport's in order, sending it in Europe, champagne, caviar, the ocean. Really? Well, except for the fact that I hate caviar, -consider me packed. -Great. Okay, Jonathon, what gives? This is nothing like you. What's the catch? None. You're gonna have a great time. [♪♪♪] You're not going? Jonathon, you're scaring me. Were you sending me away? What? What is it? Just find me the place. Go directly home. You wait for my call, and then you go to the airport. You buy your ticket there. And you call your office, and you make your excuse before boarding. Who are you hiding me from? What have I done? It's just a precaution. I just don't want anybody using you to get to me, alright? Now, if you do exactly what I say, everything will be alright. What about when I come back in tow to three weeks? What about this business you're involved in? What if it's not over yet? It'll be over. [SCOFFS] [♪♪♪] Bartender, huh? [AIRPLANE ENGINE ROARS] That ain't your name on that sign, brudder. But it will be by the time you get back here. -Thanks a lot. -Yeah. Yeah, right. [♪♪♪] Oh, Kim? Hi, Jonathon. -I'm a friend of your father's. -Hi. -Is he here? -No, he couldn't make it. So, he asked me to pick you up. Well, Dad would've left me a message. I could've taken a taxi. No, you see, he's not home. Uh, he had a slight, uh, accident. KIM: Accident? Is he okay? Is he in the hospital? JONATHON: No, no, he's fine. He just, uh-- He's at my home. He's doing fine. Well, can you let go of me? -Where are we going? -Uh... [♪♪♪] Actually, I feel like a soda. How about you? What the hell are you doing? Let go of me! [♪♪♪] No, no, no. We're not finished, thanks. Look, you'd better let go of my wrist, Stretch, or I'm gonna let out a scream that's gonna rock your socks. This is what they teach you at finishing school? I can't wait to send my daughter there. I happen to be doing post-grad work in psychol-- Why am I telling you this? It's probably first-level fear syndrome coupled with irrational insecurity. Hey, baby. This haole bother you? Ah, the lady's fine. You know, it's not polite to sit when you're not asked. Now that we know where we stand, you may sit. Look, I don't know what any of you want. -Please. -It's alright, Kim. You don't need to be afraid. These are just two-for-a-quarter errand boys. Sent by the big boys when babies and puppies need to be frightened. I guess someone thinks you're a puppy. Eh, budder? Now the guy thinks I'm his brother. Take a note to Osato for me, alright? You let him know that nothing is gonna happen to the Tanakas. But something will happen to anyone that interferes while they're in my care. And now for an impromptu demonstration. -[GRUNTS] -[DISHES SHATTER] You're dead! [SHOUTS] [♪♪♪] Back off. See how easy life can be? [♪♪♪] -Help me, help me! -I am helping you! What's going on? [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] KIM: Help! Help! Help me! I'm being kidnapped! You're not! Excuse me. We're newlyweds. [♪♪♪] It's a dead end! Oh! What you lack in judgment you make up for in spunk. You broke my heel! Say good night, Gracie. [SCREAMS] [FIGHTING SOUNDS] [GRUNTS] What?! Are you crazy?! No, just high-spirited. [♪♪♪] [GUNFIRE] [♪♪♪] [ENGINE ROARING] How was school in Switzerland? KIM: Who the hell are you?! I told you. Repeating myself would serve no purpose. Why should I believe my dad sent you? What, you'd rather believe he sent those other goons? Damn! Can't you wait? I'm not exactly dressed to play Sheena Queen of the Jungle. You know, I had a car waiting for us right at the curb in front of the airport. You're the one that chose this alternate route. So, if you don't mind picking up the pace, I believe those gentlemen with the room temperature IQs -are right behind us. -I can't! My heel is broken! Do you now how much these shoes cost me in Geneva? Now, you're on an even keel. What is happening? What is all this? I think it's best you let your father tell you. No! This isn't exactly the way one is normally met at the airport, you know? Tell me! Did those men hurt my dad? Who are they?! Please. I mean... I guess you saved me back there. Oh, please, don't gush over me. I wouldn't want to get a swelled head. Who would want to hurt my dad or me? [♪♪♪] Yakuza. Yakuza?! [♪♪♪] MAN: Mano and Nicky, they're still getting patched up. This dude was supernatural! Go. We almost got killed out there. You give us another shot. Let me get some more guys, and we'll grease this haole! OSATO: If you were twenty-fold, you'd perhaps do nothing but get yourself killed. I wanted to make sure before I proceeded in my own way. You sent us out there knowing that we might get whacked by this haole?! In life, there are two kinds of people. Those who make the decisions, and those who carry them out. Obviously, you failed in your half. Get out while I'm still smiling. [♪♪♪] [SPEAKS JAPANESE] [SPEAKS JAPANESE] [JIRO CONTINUES IN JAPANESE] [IN ENGLISH] I will give what I promised your master, Raven and his bastard son. But when I am ready, not before. We're on the verge of the most powerful union in our lifetime: Yakuza and the Black Dragon. You would risk that for your own petty impatience? And you call yourself a warrior. You still know nothing of discipline. Even after 15 years, even after the near total annihilation of your clan. OSATO: It was your duty to be there that day. No matter how much you despise a Westerner being honored by the Black Dragon. No matter how jealous. [♪♪♪] You allowed your personal weaknesses to overshadow your obligation. Had you been there, you could have stopped Raven. You're the only one who could have defeated him. But you will have to bear the responsibility for that day. Not your master, not me. You, and you alone. I will give you the chance for atonement after you've succeeded. You will know great power at my side. Hi, little lady. Need a lift? [JONATHON GRUNTING] Did you have to flag down a former sumo wrestler? I feel horrible doing this. He'll be okay, won't he? No, I killed him. I just thought it only fair to pay for the funeral.

People take the responsibility of strangers all the time and don't question it. Just as long as it fits in a little, narrow book of rules. It's routine in cases of emergency. A fire, an auto accident, earthquake. Cat falls down into a well? Sure. A sea animal gets caught in an oil spill? Of course. Anybody can do the right thing under the right circumstances.

I'm merely putting my finely honed ability to consume alcohol in, uh, abeyance. You'll notice that the cap is still on the bottle. It's simply there to... heckle me. Okay, guys, let's stoke up the furnace. You never know when you might need some energy. Here we go. -Here you go. And for you. -Thank you. Eat up. It'll put hair on your chest. Yeah. Just what I was hopin'. Ah. -Shh-shh. -What is it? Somebody's outside. I don't see anything. Get the light. [RACKS GUN] [♪♪♪] I can't see anyone. Get behind the tree. [KIM SCREAMING] [♪♪♪] [MUSIC FADES] -JONATHON: Kim? -They took her, Jon. They took her! Well, I never heard 'em until we were knee-deep in black long-johns. KENNY: I'm gonna kill them. When this is over, I'm gonna kill them whether they hurt her or not. Jonathon, they tunneled their way in here or flew in on the wings of angels. I doubt this bunch is on speaking terms with anything resembling an angel. I've never experienced anything like them in my life. Except that one time I worked in the jungle. That was with you. These ain't no Yakuzas. Nope. Black Dragons. -What?! -KENNY: Black Dragons? We're lucky to be alive. Not lucky. If they didn't want you alive, you wouldn't be. Jon, they said they're gonna kill Kim in two hours unless I did everything they asked. I just don't get it. Osato suddenly has an army of Black Dragons. There's been bad blood between the Yakuza and Black Dragon factions for a decade. So, why are they working for my cousin, a Yakuza oyabun? Because he was able to offer them something they wanted pretty badly for a long time. Me. He came here to muscle you over a drug deal and stumbled into something much more valuable to them. Once Osato figured out who I was, that information bought some... assistance from the Black Dragons. What would these Black Dragons want from you? They want his death certificate. I, um... I was a Black Dragon. You? I've heard stories about Westerners who wanted to be Black Dragons. But none about any who survived the training. Well, why would they wanna kill you then? 'Cause they killed my parents. So, I infiltrated the cult and trained, strictly so I could avenge their murders. And I did. Fortunately, a couple of little Black Dragons had gone to the market that day. They weren't too happy with the surprise when they came home. KENNY: That's it then. If I want Kim back, there's no other choice but to do what they ask. So, I'll meet Osato in two hours and make him an owner in my club so he can run his drug business. Okay, okay, I know I don't understand you. I never did, never needed to. Never gave two hoots and a holler one way or the other. But you have stripped your fly wings. Something is on your mind. I can tell by the conversation. Jonathon, these Black Dragons, they're the same ones looking to have your guts for souvenirs. They're the ones that you're always afraid would find your son before we did. Now, you gotta exit stage left. Well, me and the Tanakas don't stand a chance against these people. Well, neither does your boy. I mean, you can't throw his life away and that's what could happen if you tango with these Black Dragons now and lose. -I do not intend to lose. -Oh, to hell with that. You gotta start layin' tracks. Now, I'm here. I can handle this. -Unless you thinking I can't. -No, I don't. But I can, because I'm one of them. No, you're not. But that's what runs your engine. You're gonna make the wrong choice for the same reason you always make the wrong choice. This cockeyed sense of honor you got. I don't know what you learned or whatever in Japan, whatever it is, it drives you, but it's screwed up. You got the one thing your training couldn't overcome and that's a heart. You sound like the Tin Man when he finally meets the Wizard. You got a heart, it's just full of remorse. Well, Ski, I guess I'm gonna have to carry around a little bit more remorse, because if I check-out on the Tanakas, you'll all regret it. Alright, I know I'm wasting my breath. It's been a job to keep your sorry butt alive. You're trying to risk your sorry one for a bunch of strangers. You only got so much karma or whatever it is you call it. Save it for people who care. For your son. The reality is that nobody out there gives two spits for Jonathon Raven or his son. Jonathon, don't you hear me? Nobody else cares! You care. Alright. I, uh, let Suzy know we're okay. I figure they know where we are, so there's no point in hiding anymore. [HEAVY SIGH] Damn it, Jon. This is what I wanted to avoid. Look what my life has done to her. Do we saddle up? I say we grab these guys and talk to them and start taking down names. Are you crazy? There's a half-dozen Black Dragons running around. There'll be Osato and who knows how many others. There's only two of you. Yeah, I'd hate to be in their shoes for anything. Excuse me. [♪♪♪] [MUSIC FADES] [ENGINE OFF] You have no idea how much I'm shaking. My bones are rattling. I don't know it's such a good idea trying to commando-raid with someone who's a card-carrying coward. You just relax and have your meeting with Osato. And the rest of the evening's on us. Jon, you know I-- You know how much Kim means to me. And I'm gonna bring her home to you. Just trust me, alright? - That's all you gotta do, trust me. -Alright. Give us ten minutes to break in, and then make your move. -With no apologies. -[RACKS GUN] [♪♪♪] Jonathon, I know you gave me an offer... [♪♪♪] I'm right with ya. Ski! [♪♪♪] [FIGHTING SOUNDS] KENNY: Jon, I'm sorry. Oh, God, I'm sorry! The one thing no one has a defense for, trust. You bastard. I've done what you wanted. Now where's my daughter?! Inside. With the papers. You, my friend, are in for much pain. Ah, you've awakened just in time to die. Oh, I knew my luck would change. [GROANS] Then you must be Osato. The butt-brained dope pusher who kidnaps his own cousin's daughter. talk like that, I could cut your tongue out. Oh, excuse me. You must be Cousin Osato, the very polite, import-export king who... kidnaps his own cousin's daughter. And you are the one now called "Raven". The only Westerner to survive training with the Black Dragons. I couldn't believe the scope of my fortune to have such a bargaining piece dropped in my lap. See how easy life can be? For years, the Yakuza and Black Dragons have had friction between them. Every Yakuza leader knows that to repair this would make him the most powerful leader of this army of Black Dragon warriors. Let me guess who's planning on becoming just that particular dude. Just a matter of business expedience. Black Dragons get what they want: revenge. I get their loyalty. Tanaka gets his daughter back. And I get dead. Well, you just can't satisfy everybody, can you? As long as you satisfy those most anxious to speak with you. And you will. Sure. Untie me, I'll put on the coffee. There's plenty I could talk to them about. How they can expect to be double-crossed by Osato, as Ken Tanaka was. And you don't even have to be a blood relative. It won't be necessary. They're only interested in one thing. Exacting revenge on the man who betrayed them. Betrayed their teachings and slaughtered their masters. And how do they plan on doing that, by you talking me to death? This conversation bores me. I think I'll sit it out. You will talk, surely. You'll talk openly and willingly. You must realize that's the only reason why you're still alive. But they will not feel they've exacted true vengeance with only your death. They want your son. Yes. You've been searching for him for so long, haven't you? Must be close. They'll take up the search now. And as sure as you're going to die here tonight, they will find him. They will punish him for what you have done. No, Raven, the best you can hope for is that you don't live long enough to watch what they're going to do to your son. [♪♪♪] Call me when the drug has softened him up and he's ready to talk. JONATHON: Osato. I am going to kill you. I'm gonna kill all of you. [♪♪♪] Oh, God, I hate needles. [BOTH GRUNTING] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] KENNY: Hiroshi! Please! Stop this! Please, Hiroshi, stop this. Sign. [PUNCHING CONTINUES] OSATO: Tell us what you know about Raven's son. You know what you can all go to? OSATO: Yes, yes. I've heard that before. -[GRUNTS] -You know that's not humanly possible. Even for men like these. Quite an arsenal, my friend. You know, you can never be too rich or too thin or too prepared. Be careful with those. Been in the family for generations. [SPEAKS JAPANESE] OSATO: They're getting impatient. Likewise. This is the easy way. They want to take over for Hachi. Believe me, it will be more severe. Oh, such a deal. I don't know how to repay you. How about this? [SPITS] [GROWLS] [♪♪♪] OSATO: [ECHOES] They want your son. [♪♪♪] [FIGHTING SOUNDS] OSATO: [ECHOES] They want your son. [♪♪♪] [BOTH GRUNTING] [♪♪♪] [GROANS] Oh, I'm gonna kill all of ya. You'll have to stand in line. Raven's already made that request. Well then, there won't be anybody left to stand in line for. -[COUGHS] -I hand you over to them. Likewise, for your friend Raven. I doubt I'll see you again. Oh, for sure. I plan on going that way. [BOTH SPEAK JAPANESE] [♪♪♪] KENNY: Hiroshi. Please let her go. I've signed the papers like I promised. You are now my partner in the club. Please, don't let Kim see this. -Let her go. We had a deal. -[PUNCHES LANDING] If only I could trust you, my dear cousin. The way that Raven trusted you. [♪♪♪] KEN: It's okay. -[KENNY GROANS] -[KIM SCREAMS] -[KENNY SCREAMS] -Dad! Oh, God, Dad! -[KIM SOBS] -[KENNY GROANS] -No, Dad! -[SPEAKS JAPANESE] [♪♪♪] [FIGHTING SOUNDS] [SPEAKS JAPANESE] [♪♪♪] [FIGHTING SOUNDS CONTINUE] [♪♪♪] [SOBBING] There was no reason! No reason! Osato just killed him! No, he's okay. He's not dead. What?! Oh, thank God! But he will be if we don't get him help. I could use some of that over here, sport. -[GROANS] -You look like crap. Yeah, well, for some reason I feel taller. He made a sound! Yeah, well, the next sound we're gonna hear is us deep-frying. [SHOUTING] Go! Go! [♪♪♪] [SHOUTING] [♪♪♪] Well, are you alright? Where's Jonathon? -I'm going back in. -You can't! [♪♪♪] Hey, it must be my lucky day. Jonathon did leave me one. [♪♪♪] [SHOUTS] [SCREAMS] [GROANS] You dum-dum. I've seen that one before. [SCREAMING] Yah! [♪♪♪] Jonathon! God! I thought I was gonna have to go in there and drag your sorry butt outta there! You did alright? Jonathon, thank you! Dad told me what he did to you. SKI: Let's get outta here before this place blows sky-high! Alright. Come on, help me. [♪♪♪♪♪ [MUSIC FADES] -JONATHON: Ski, pull. -[SKI GRUNTS] JONATHON: I got it. -You leaving? -Yeah. Well, a guy can only take so much of a place like this. Where you going? We're lucky to catch you coming by here today, huh? JONATHON: "We"? Can you talk to him, Jonathon? I mean, you can imagine what he must feel like. No, I can't. And you wouldn't have done the same thing if it was your son who was kidnapped. Kim, look. I know he's your father, and I know you love him very much. But he said he would do anything to get you back alive. He did. He must be content with that. I can't offer him anything else. KIM: But can't you just talk to him for a second? For me? Look, I don't know why I said that. I mean, it sounds like you owe me something, instead of the other way around. But he's never gonna see you again after today. And maybe Dad betraying you won't matter to you anymore. But I told him that I would try to do this for him, and that matters to me. Sometimes... sometimes you've gotta do the necessary things at the necessary time. [♪♪♪] Jon... two times with the same dagger and still ticking. I must have some strong karma. Look, Kim told me all about it. You should've left me there dead, Jon. Guess I'm not built that way. Besides, people were watching. I'm image conscious. Jonathon. I let Kim think that I wanted another chance to apologize. Not that I don't want that, but unlike her, I know that... there's no point. You think he'll forgive him? Well, I can't say that. [SIGHS] But it wasn't so long ago that he wouldn't have even been able to try. I just want to give this to you. I'm fresh out of pleases, Jon. [♪♪♪] It's the real thing. I had to pull a lot of strings to have it come so fast. Find your son. I'll pray that you won't need that to find him and get him back. But the Black Dragon cult is many in number. And you used yours to get my child back. [♪♪♪] Hey. Thank you. Good luck. Well, that's it. You ready to saddle up? Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. [COUGHS] Now, Jonathon, you ain't gonna go all weepy on me, now are ya? I said I'd stick around a while. We got a lead on that new godson of mine. But not if you're gonna go weepy. It ain't nothing I hate worse than a weepy guy, is a weepy guy with a sword. You gotta get rid of one or the other. [♪♪♪] See how easy life can be? [BOTH LAUGH] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
