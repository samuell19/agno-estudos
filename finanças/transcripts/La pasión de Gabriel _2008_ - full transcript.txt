THE PASSION OF GABRIEL I baptize you, Magnolia, in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen. We're done. It was very easy. Look, congratulations. Thank you, Father. Nice one, Father! What is going on, dude? Are you OK? Let me see. Everything's fine! Let's get on with the party. We're having a great time here in the village of Cielo Nuevo with this wonderful group, Los Chachos de Colombia. Can you believe these guys? One drink, and they're at each other's throats. - What happened, Gilberto? - Torres came after me. - He says I owe him money. - What for? I bought some pigs from him and he wants me to pay now and I don't have the money. That's what you get for being a wise guy. I told him I'd pay him, and now he wants to kill me. Oh, Gilberto, you love to fight. Let's see... Listen, Angela, are we in danger of not losing him? Stop whining, Gilberto. The party's over for you. We'll talk later. Let's go, let's go! He's been giving me the run around, but nobody's going to rip me off. Why didn't you come to us? This is the kind of bullshit you're always getting involved in. How are you, Josue? Aren't you ashamed? Listen to this idiot! He was going to kill someone over a couple of pigs! Listen, Father... Why don't you go to your party and let us take care of this? Gilberto says he'll have the money in two weeks. They're fixing him up. You should be grateful it was nothing serious. Can I have a word with you in private, Father? Bastard. Come on, Josué. We don't want to blow this out of proportion and ruin the bazaar. You know it was because of the drinking. Why complicate things for these people? Look, pal... You know how we fix problems around here, don't you? Yes, I'm not asking you to stop people from hurting each other, but don't do anything to Torres. OK. Do you think we're going to shoot him or something? Go home to bed. You're too drunk to walk, old man. Old man? The sun is old and still going strong. Listen... Did you put away the money from the bazaar? No, why don't I give it to you, and we'll see how long it lasts? Hey, Father, you can't sing this song. Father only sings Christmas carols. Let's finish up at my house. Sorry, I'm beat. I've got Mass tomorrow at 6 a.m. No problem, Father. We'll send you off at 5:55. Silvia, come with us! No, I'm too tired. Come on, Negro, don't be a pain... Goodbye. - Come on! Let's go home. - Silvia? What? How about a glass of wine? You have Mass tomorrow at 6 a.m. Just one... It's been blessed. Not tonight, Your Holiness. Are you still up, Father? I thought you'd be asleep by now. Actually, I'm about to fall over. Honey, I thought you were over at the teacher's house. No, dad, I'm too tired. See you tomorrow, Father. See you tomorrow, Silvia. See you tomorrow, don Pablo. Good night, Father. What did you decide, Marcos? School or up the mountain? It's just that I already said I'd go with them. OK, then. Go dig latrines and trenches until you end up in jail or get shot. But, Father, I'd make a lousy priest. Don't be stupid, Marcos. I'm giving you a chance to get ahead. Father, give us the ball while you finish changing. You guys are in such a hurry... There you go. So what do I tell them? Nothing. Don't worry about them. Neither one of us is going to tell them where you've gone. Let's go, boys! Over here! Over here! What's the matter with you? How could you let that in? It's not my fault, you let him take the ball from you! Oh, yes. Hey, Joaco! What brings you here? I came by to say hello, Father. Come on up! - How's it going up there? - Fine. We've missed you at the soccer games. I've missed you guys too, Father. Father... I need your help. Of course, son. What is it? Help me get out. Why are you asking me? You're the only one who can help me. I never get mixed up in those affairs. If you want to get out, tell them. If it were that easy, I wouldn't be here asking for your help. They sent you to test me, didn't they? Sorry to bother you, Father. You'll have to learn to live with your mistakes, young man. You'll have to get out of this one by yourself. I know I messed up, Father, but I really don't know what to do. Joaco! Let's try something. Be down here tomorrow at 4 a.m., and we can do something. You think you can handle life up on the mountain? Ah, I think I can. Look, honey, it's tough up there. Don't think that people go to the mountain for vacation. You'll have to dodge bullets, you know? Uh? I'll tell you what... You think about it for a few days, I'll speak to them and see what they say. OK, sir. Thanks a lot. Go on, I'll see what I can do. - You took your time. - I stopped by to see my mom. This is for Commander Efrain. Tell him I'll send him the package tomorrow. Listen... Don't waste any more time on visits. - No, sir. - Go on, you're late. That's how I hoped to find you. Yaneth... I didn't think I'd see you again today. My dear, so beautiful. What were you talking to Josué about? I told him I wanted to go up mountain with you. You're crazy, Yaneth. Why? What do you mean "why"? I thought we decided to be together. Did you change your mind? No. But why did you talk to that guy without asking me first? What's the problem, Joaco? Do you have another girl up there? No... - That's not it. Don't be silly. - So... I can't tell you now, but I'll be down tonight, and we'll talk. Really? You're not coming back tonight, Joaco. Yes, I'll be back tonight, and we'll talk. Be good, son. And take care of yourself. - You take care of yourself, ma. - Of course, son. - I'll write to you. - I hope so. Why so glum? You're off to heaven and crying about it? God bless you, Father. Don't worry, doña Carmen. Good morning, Isauro! You're late, Father. I was about to leave. Oh, I overslept. Did you get those crossheads fixed on your car? Yes, I did. Father Oscar will be waiting for you. You'll be fine, Marco. He's very helpful. Take this money, just in case. Thank you, Father. Here you go. You know it, do good in school and find yourself a nice girl. Good luck, son. Go! Father, send greetings to my mom. - Have a good trip! - Take care. You're setting yourself up for a hard time with that new job in Public Works. Yes, man. I'm on my way. Just let me finish up here with one last patient. Father, let's talk next week. I have an urgent meeting at the governor's office and I've got to go, if you excuse me. What do you mean, Ramiro? Just a second. I came all this way just to meet with you, and now you're running off? No. Sorry, Father. Uh? You know how important these meetings are. Call before you come next Thursday, to make sure you don't waste the trip. I don't care about the trip, Ramiro. You know what disappoints me the most? Having to go back and tell those people who voted for you that, once again, you couldn't listen to us. Father, why are you doing this to me? OK! I confess. This year's budget is gone, and there's nothing left for public works. You want me to go to jail? If you already knew that, why did you make me waste my time coming down here? Isn't it better to be honest? I am being honest. There's no money. What are we going to do? Maybe next year. We'll find the money for your little bridge project. But don't be a stranger, we miss seeing you around here. - See you later, sweetheart. - Ramiro. Why were you fighting with the mayor, Gabriel? Can't you see you've got to treat him with kid gloves? Ah, Silvita... I don't know how you can work with such an incompetent! What do we have to do to at least get some technical advice? If it's technical advice you need, I've got the solution. How nice to see an engineer hard at work! Hi. How are you? You can't imagine how pleased I am to see you! The pleasure's all yours, Father! Silvita, what are you on? You get prettier every day. Engineer, I need you to finish up here fast. I've got a job for you... Should I be happy or scared? Be Scared! Very scared! So who's going to supervise the work? Father Gabriel? So he's an engineer, too? Why not? At least he's willing to work. All I'm saying is we shouldn't be spending our own money on that bridge... So those government crooks can get away with their stealing. Look, man... This bridge isn't for don Pablo or for my granny, it's for everyone! He's right, Hipólito. What's your problem? The problem is that the health center is falling to pieces, but since the priest wants a bridge... What did I say, Hipólito? Father. I say it would be better to spend the money we raised on the health center. Hipólito, we decided in the last meeting that we'd fix the bridge. So stop being such a pain! Well, if you all think I'm such a pain, I'm going home. I have no voice around here. You don't give a damn what I think. Here's the key to the cash box, Father. Spend the money any way you like. Those who'd like to take part on the Eucharist and have any sins to confess, please come to the chapel... Yaneth, Yaneth, I need to talk to you! After recess we can talk. Thank you. Have you seen Joaco lately? Not me. No, Father. Why? No... I heard he wanted to talk to me but I haven't heard from him. Did he say about what? No. I thought he wanted me to marry you two. They probably wouldn't let him come. Mm... You're probably right. Father! Is there something you're not telling me? Nothing, honey. If you see him, tell him to come see me. Hello, Father. You almost broke your neck looking at that girl. -Go on, say something to her. Girl! -No... She's too ugly. Ugly? It's time to you woke up. At your age, I had two girlfriends at a time. With two girlfriends, you'd never have become a priest. Alcides! Go straight home. There's a lot to be done. Father! I need to talk to you. How are you, Josué? Listen, Father... Up on the mountain, they're worried about that bridge you're planning to fix. Why is that? They think the bridge is going to let the army in. Ah, Josué... Tell them not to be so stupid. The community is planning to fix that bridge, so they can get their products to market. I guess so. But if the army moves in, we're stuck in the middle, and blood might get shed. What do you mean "we", Josué? Look, Father... Why don't you go back to the Town Council and think it over again? Come on, why don't you tell them that yourself? Tell them you don't want a bridge, and see what they say. OK. I'm just telling you what they told me. You will see. Thank you. See you later, Hipólito. Goodbye, Father. How does it look, engineer? How does it look? It looks good to me. Does it? Yes! It looks real good to me. I checked the foundations, and they're fine. I'll run a load test, but it looks good. I'm going to find a carpenter. I've already got a welder. I just need to pick out the wood. That's wonderful! I don't know how to thank you. Don't start crying, Father! I'll tell you what, I won't charge you for the work on the bridge if you don't charge me when you marry me and Silvia. Silvia? She doesn't know it yet, but I'm telling you, she's mine. So, do we have a deal? Give it your best shot, engineer. Don't go. I have to go, Father. Come here, give me a kiss. What's the matter? Are you sad or want to confess? Do you know what I feel? What? One of these days you're going to leave me. And I won't be able to stop you. I love you a lot. But no matter how much I love you, I can't stop being a priest. I had... Forgive me. Forgive yourself, Father. Good morning, doña Elvira. Doña Faustina, you're looking good. - What is going on, Eusebio? - Father! Calm down, Gabriel. The first thing we should do is call the police, and wait to see what they do. What if the police refuse to go up there? What if they think it's a trap? What if it is? All the more reason to wait. Wait, Gabriel! Why don't we call the Red Cross? They'll come up. Meanwhile, we can get things ready to take up there. -There's nothing we can do anyway. -So go call them. I'll see you up there. Gabriel, the Red Cross can't get here before noon. The police are sending an inspector and a few men, but only as far as town. Thanks, Rosario. Anyone want to come up with us? I do, Father. - Who else? - We're coming too. Let's go. No, no, no, Gabriel. You can't take these kids. You're asking for trouble. I know what I'm doing, Rosario. Let's go! It's Joaco. Do you know why Joaco is dead? Because he was a fool! He thought it would be cool to carry a gun. And by the time he realized it wasn't what he expected, it was too late. Who's next? Mm? Answer me! Gabriel! The Red Cross is probably in town by now. Do me a favor and escort them up, and take these kids back down. I'll wait here. - I'll stay here with you. - No! No! Let's go. Father... Did you know Joaco wanted out? Is that why he was looking for you? I'm so sorry. Father, Gabriel... It was very irresponsible of you. How could you take my daughter up there with you? Show some consideration, doña Luz. I'm not speaking to you, Miss. This is between me and Father Gabriel. It was for their own good. Look, doña Luz... If I could've prevented this day from happening, I would have. Forgive me. No, Father. You think that because you're a priest, you can do as you please. But you're wrong. Look at this, Silvia. What is it, son? Who would have done such a thing? Who do you think? What a fool. Gabriel! Gabriel! - What's the matter, Silvia? - Just look at this! And look at your hands! Are you crazy? Silvia, we're inside a temple... And you'd better stay inside, because they're waiting for you! Do you want to die? Calm down, please. I'm calm. You calm down, damn it! Through this holy anointing, may the Lord in his love and mercy help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit, and free you from sin, grant your salvation, and comfort you in your illness. May God bless you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen. Now get some rest. Father Gabriel! Boys! The Commander needs to talk to you. Please come with us. Alone. Go on, I'll be down in a while. Will this take long? That depends on what the Commander has to say. Father, I've got to blindfold you. For your own safety. - Alcides. - Yes, sir. Go get ready for evening Mass. Yes, sir. Get lost, kid. Go! Let's go! - There you go. - Thank you. The Commander is on his way. I hope he's not late. I've got Mass at 6 a.m. Listen... I'll bet the last time you went to Mass was for your first communion. You're close. What a shame. Gentlemen... - Father Gabriel. - Commander. Father... Efrain. We brought you up here because there are a few things we need to clear up. And since you haven't accepted our invitations... I never attend political functions. But now that I'm here, there's a few things I'd like to clear up with you, too. Father... What do you know about this? You know more about it than I do, commander. This is a direct accusation of our movement. If it wasn't you, then why don't you ride down and convince the boy's mother you had nothing to do with it? He was with you until he showed up dead like an animal. That boy was missing until you found him. Look, Father... We've been in this region a lot longer than you have. And here, not even a chicken goes missing, no one misbehaves. It's not because of your preaching. We teach them to respect each other. And yet... When people show up dead, you know nothing about it. We're looking into the boy's death, but I'm warning you. If this is your doing, you've declared yourself our enemy. I'm not looking for enemies, Commander. Let's hope not, Father. Ah! I almost forgot... Your little dream of a bridge is only going to bring trouble. Keep your hands out of the fire or you'll get burned. Father, I've had my eye on you ever since you came here, and you seem like a good person. You've done important things with the people in the village. Thanks, Efrain. Father, Father... Listen. You like people to listen to you, right? Why don't you listen? Let's work together. It's better for everyone that way. See you later. See you later, Father. Hey, Father! It's getting late! What are you doing here, Alcides? Didn't I tell you to get ready for Mass? How could I know you'd be back in time? What were you doing here by yourself? - Teaching the hen to swim. - Don't do it again. They'll be blaming me for teaching you bad habits. - Aren't you? - Listen to you! Father, were you scared? Yes, son, a little bit, but what else can you do? Bravo! I forgot to mention... Silvia sends her love, but she was too busy to come. She's not too busy. She's still mad at me. That's what the long face is all about? I don't know, Rosario. Sometimes I just do stupid things. You're right about that. You shouldn't have taken those kids up the mountain, Gabriel. We warned you. You got the whole village against you. You saw doña Luz... And then those flyers. Beautiful! That's not what worries me. It should be. I'm responsible for what happened to Joaco. What do you mean? Why? He asked me to help him desert, and I said I would. If I hadn't told him I'd help, he'd still be alive, Rosario. You did what you're supposed to do. You did what you could. Don't blame yourself for a murder you didn't commit. Remember, Gabriel, you're not the Saviour. Oh... I know perfectly well who I am, Rosario. Hm... Manolo! The wood's here! Call the boys! Come on... Come on through! Come on through! Hang on a minute. This looks kind of dangerous. This is too weak and the car is too heavy. These boards are rotten. I'm not risking my jeep, it's my meal ticket. The wood's fine. I checked it myself. It is fine! - Father, what are you doing? Let him come! Let him come! Father, that was irresponsible. No, no, no. How could you do that to me? I don't want to... I told you, Isauro, the jeep would make it! You're a riot! Very funny. Well, Silvia. Shall we? Yes, it's getting late, Ricardo. Goodbye, Father. Goodbye, Silvia. We're going to dance. I won't invite you, Father, to save you from sin. Well... Let's get those boards off the jeep! I'll be back tomorrow, Manolo, but in the afternoon! - Alcides! - Yes, mom. - Father is waiting for you! - I'm on my way! Tell him the boy got work to do here. I'll finish tomorrow. You can go when you finish here. Let him go! He's worked all day, and in this heat! I said no! Alcides! Did you hear me? Come here, come here. How are you, Ramón? Father... Is something wrong? No... We were just playing. I see. You'll excuse us, then. See you later, doña Gladis. See you later, Father. One of these days, your father is going to whip us good. Old bugger... The little brat will pay for that. What did you say about the boy? What "boy"? He's not a boy anymore. He needs a couple of women and some hard work. Silvia? Can we talk? Not now, Gabriel. OK, then, later. I'll wait. Don't wait for me. Why are you angry with me? What is wrong with you? What's wrong with me? I see no point in talking to you. You end up doing whatever you please. I'm tired of your stupid pranks, Gabriel. I'm tired of climbing into your bed behind everyone's back. I'm tired of not being able to see you whenever I want. Do you think it's easy being the priest's girlfriend? It's because of Botero, isn't it? Don't be stupid, Gabriel. It's your own fault! Stop hurting me, OK? What are you doing here, Alcides? They're waiting for you at the church. Bless this bridge in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen. We're all very excited to have completed this project, the re-opening of the Cielo Nuevo Bridge. We hope it will bring progress and development to the region. Thank you very much. Bravo! Congratulations, Ramiro. Thank you! Ricardo, congratulations... Don't get fresh! Oh, no. Keep your hands to yourself! Thank you very much. Hey, Mr. Mayor! All that effort spent on Silvia gone to waste. Someone's jumped ahead of you! Not ahead of me! Listen to this... One of them is buying notebooks while the other is doing the homework. Look at him! He looks like a beaten cock. "A beaten cock". What are you talking about? The priest lost his girl! Why do you think the priest is always visiting the mayor's office? So be careful! Father, let's drink to that project we pulled off! "We"? "We" is a few too many, Mr. Mayor. No, the project was all yours. I came over to congratulate you. Father, Saint Gabriel. I'm no saint. Everybody here worked very hard to finish that project while you were at your meetings. Take it easy, Father. You know politics... Some provide the Hail Marys, and other get all the blessings. Well spoken, don Chepe. Why don't we ask one of those beautiful girls to dance? Watch this, Father. May I, Isauro? - Go right ahead, Mr. Mayor. - Come on, honey. Come on, Father. Or were you born a saint? We're honored to have you here, Mr. Mayor. I hope it won't be the last time. But we'll be seeing you at the Mayor's office, right? No... If I'm going to waste my time, I'd rather do it up here. Who said you were wasting your time? But if you don't watch it, someone's going to make off with that little calf you've got tied up, a long-haired engineer. - That's not funny, Ramiro. - But it's true. Go home and sleep it off. While you're at it, watch what you're saying... And you watch your step! You don't want to get lost and end up in Purgatory. So pretty... You'd better cross yourself... - Are you coming with us, Gabriel? - I'm going to bed. See you later, engineer. Father... Your blessing! - See you tomorrow, Silvia. - See you tomorrow. - Is Father Gabriel angry? - No. Let's go home and tie one on. Let's go! Let's go! No, I think I'll stay. - Why? - I'm tired. I'll see you tomorrow. A little while! I'll walk you home. Don't beg! All the more booze for us. She didn't even kiss me goodnight! You're such a push-over! She's gonna wipe the floor with you. You have to be hard on them! Just wait until we get home, you'll see who is the one who works hard. - Silvia! - Well, you, honey. What am I going to do with you, Gabriel? The Mayor is on to us. People were bound to catch on. You don't seem to mind. Well... You better figure out what you want. You can't go on living like this and still be a priest, Gabriel. It's the life I chose, Silvia. Really? What do you want? Shall I marry Botero? Or go into a convent so you can rest easy? Why don't you get lost and leave me in peace? Find someone else to put up with you! And leave me alone! Lower your voice! People will hear us! All you're worried about is whether someone will hear us! Silvia. Wait... Why do you have to be that way? -Why? Sign this quickly. - It has to go out this afternoon. - - Let me sign, Hipólito. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Father. You can't sign. Why not? Say it! Or is it a letter asking them to remove me from my post? Father, the truth is, people think you should go. Really? Why is that, doña Luz? They say you're setting a bad example for the young people. I see. What do you mean by "a bad example"? You think it's OK to drink alcohol? And get into fights with everyone? And endangering our children by taking them to pick up corpses? You caused too much trouble, and that's why people have written this letter. What do you mean by "people", Hipólito? The guys up the mountain? At the Mayor's office? People in town? You see, Father? You're in trouble with everyone. Father Gabriel! I just saw soldiers up at the farm! - There's going to be shooting. - What do you mean? Yesterday, I saw a bunch of guerrillas in the same place. Everyone living outside the village, please stay inside your homes. Military operations have begun in the region and for your own safety, please remain indoors. Father, the army's here. Thank you. - Good morning, gentlemen. - Good morning. - Can we search you, please? - Let's... Why do you want to search me? I'm asking you nicely... Who are you? Gabriel Rodriguez, the parish priest. So you're the priest? Father Gabriel, what's going on? Stand back, miss. We're performing a search. Let me through! This is a military operation. She is the school principal. Really? I can imagine the kind of education kids around here are getting. You could do with a little education yourself. Get ready to be searched, please. I want to see your papers, too. And those of everyone in that room! Barbosa! Check their IDs. Father Gabriel... They've taken William, they say he's a guerrilla. What? When? They just dragged him out of the house with some other boys. - Where are they holding them? - Probably in the truck they came in. We've got to talk to them before getting any deeper. Stay here, Miriam. Let Father Gabriel fix that. Lieutenant! - What do you do? - I'm a lumberman. - Where? - In the village. Lieutenant! What can I do for you, Father? I heard you detained a couple of boys and I need to know who they are. You can go. Look, Father. I told you, we're performing a military operation and just because you know the detainees, it doesn't mean they aren't who we're looking for. What are you insinuating? Father, the matter is out of my hands. You're better off staying out of this. It's none of your business. Of course it's my business. I'm the pastor in this community. You're better off letting us do our job. Don't take advantage of the situation. I'm not taking advantage of anyone and I'm not asking for any favors. All I want is for you to treat these people fairly. Are you going to arrest me for that? Father... Don't act the revolutionary, I might just believe you. Father, how can I help you? Major, I'm here because... Those boys have nothing to do with guerrillas. Your lieutenant didn't want to come back empty-handed. So he grabbed the first three kids he gets his hands on and he says they're guerrillas. You know it won't do any good, Major. All you're doing by not listening is turning the community against you. Look, Father... Our intelligence reports say just the opposite. Those boys are in serious trouble. We'll investigate, and if they're clean, they'll be released. How long will your investigation take? This investigation will take as long as it takes, Father. Have a good day. Take a look at this letter. The villagers asked me to deliver it to you personally. Everyone signed it... It says they know these boys and they can swear they're good people. I sent a copy to a press agent I know and friends at radio stations. I think you should take a look at it. Look, Father... I want you to do me a big favor: don't complicate matters and don't start making trouble. We move through the regular channels and we respect the rules. So just let us do our job. You've been very kind. I personally vouch for those boys. They're members of the community I represent and where I work. They take part in village activities that we organize and they're honest, hard-working... Major! Major! What do you think of this? These are the families of the boys you're holding. They say they won't move until you release those boys. Father, I already told you that this matter is being taken care of. So go home, get some rest, and stop making trouble. But, Major... We can't go home at this time of night, unless you want to lock us up too... Good night. Major! What are these protests about? Thank you. Father, you look much too tired to convince anyone. -So what's going on with all this? -Major! Our interrogation hasn't produced any results, Major. And do you think they ever will? I believe they will, Major. Well then, take your time... Take all the time you need. When this place is crawling with journalists, we'll let them go, announce it was all a mistake, and you and I can move on to cleaning rifles. With all due respect, Major. My orders were to carry out a military operation... It was to bring in guerrillas, subversives and delinquents, not some radical priest to hang around causing trouble. You have until 2 a .m. to wind this up. Or you and I are going to have problems. You're dismissed. Yes, Major. Ass-kisser. Thank you, Father, for you have helped. It's a good thing we were able to do something. Go home and get some rest. - See you, Father. - Goodbye, Miriam. "Your presence is requested as quickly as possible. At the Archdioceses, where you will be notified of actions taken concerning you." What's the matter with these people? Everything you've done for this town! And look how they've treated you! See, Gabriel? You ruffled the feathers of all the old women, and that hypocrite Hipólito has turned everyone against you. Don't worry, I'll clear it all up with the Bishop. That's right, Father. "The saint's face makes the miracle." Gabriel, you've made a lot of enemies around here. Maybe you would be better off in a different parish. No. I may have made some mistakes, but that's no reason to run away. When will you be back, Father? I don't know, a few days maybe... But you'll be back, right? Of course I'll be back, Alcides. I'll use the trip to start looking for a school for you, OK? Take this for your trip, Father. Father Gabriel. Monsignor. Please explain how you managed to get into trouble with the villagers, the mayor, an army commander, and even the guerrillas. I didn't realize I had problems with so many people, sir. But my conscience is clear. Don't lie, Father. Your conscience cannot be clear. First of all, you've broken your vow of chastity... That's gossip, Monsignor. You were not appointed parish priest to do with it as you please. No one asked you to get involved in matters of security. Others do that kind of work. Restrict yourself, solely and exclusively, to administering the sacraments and keep yourself out of trouble. All due respect, Your Excellency. All I'm doing is preaching the Lord's word and helping the community. Inside these walls, you seem to have enormous difficulty understanding the problems of these people. One of these days, you should take a little trip up into the hills and get an idea of what I'm talking about. For the good of the church, Father Gabriel, and for your own good, I've decided to transfer you to the San Ambrosio parish, in Tolima. You have one week to organize your personal affairs and present yourself to your new parish. How can you take my parish from me, Monsignor? The parishes, Father, belong to the communities, not the priests. You've been notified. You may go now. Father... I hope this decision will lead you to give serious thought to your vocation. Have a good day. In the name of the Father, of the Son, of the Holy Spirit, amen. I hope the new priest won't be getting in our way... And will stick to Mass, not like Father Gabriel. You're such a hypocrite! Don't be so ungrateful, Hipólito! You didn't have the nerve to confront Father Gabriel yourself, so you invented gossip until they ran him out of town. It's a good thing you're a woman... Or I'd answer you as you deserve. I wish it were enough just being a woman, because with you around, anyone could wind up with a knife in the back. Oh, that's enough. Father Gabriel was transferred, but life goes on. Welcome, Your Reverence. Welcome back, Gabriel. Good to have you back. Welcome. - Father... - Alcides! - Have you been a good boy? - Yes, Father. Here's a present. - Priest... - Ah! Father... Welcome, I knew you'd be back. Can I help you, Lieutenant? Father... You really messed up my curriculum. No weapons allowed here, Lieutenant. If this is a search, show me the warrant. When it's time for a search, I'll show you the warrant, Father. Whenever you want. You'll be welcome to search for whatever you like, but until then, please leave. Do you know how long I've served my country? No, lieutenant. But don't complain to me, talk to your superiors... They sent you here to follow orders, right? How can you say we were mistreating people? You dragged those kids off and beat them and didn't even give them a chance to talk. We know this area is full of guerrillas. They come and go in this town like they owned it. Ah... Sure! I guess that's what you call military intelligence, right? Let's be honest, Lieutenant. You know they all come through here. One group comes, then they leave, then you come through and leave, and on to the next group. What are these people supposed to do? They have to learn to live with it. Because all of you bring grief. Let me give you a piece of advice, Father. Mind your own business. Remember that outside the church doors, you're just like anyone else. Don't expose yourself. Our time on this earth is brief. But the marks we leave on the path we tread, they must be deep enough to be seen by those who follow us. Our existence is tenuous... it's passing like this candle light... Don't look for eternity inside the four walls of a church. Or in the hypocrisy of a confession. True eternity is outside. It's in the mark we leave today... Like those left behind by Christ, who taught us to walk on water. He gave us his life as an example of love and his light and his mark will never disappear. Never! Let us pray. Alcides. Come home now, your father's waiting. I'll send him in a minute, doña Gladis. It's urgent, Father. What's the matter? The guerrillas have come for the boy. Ramón wants him to go with them, and they already came for him. Do you want to go, Alcides? - I didn't know... - Do you want to go or not? No. They're not taking him. But they're waiting for him, Father. I have to take him. You know Ramón. What do I do? Look... Go home and tell them you couldn't find him. I'll look for a place to hide the boy until I can get him out of here. -What if I say I don't want to go? -No, Alcides. We can't take that risk. If your father promised them, they'll take you anyway. Say goodbye. Yes, my son. Do as the priest says. Take care of yourself. Father, please take care of him. Don't worry, Mom. Gladis, be strong. Hide at the creek until they leave. - I'll come get you later. - Alcides! What's going on? Ramón has given him to the guerrillas, and he doesn't want to go. No, no, no... You'll freeze down at the creek, come inside with me. Go, go on, then. Thank you very much, don Pablo. God bless you. What are you going to do, Gabriel? We're going to organize a Christmas celebration. You're supposed to be leaving this place. I'm not letting them kick me out. - What? - You heard me. Are you crazy? Rosario, you know I love my work. - So go do it somewhere else! - Because I don't want to. Don't be stubborn, Gabriel. They'll defrock you. And without your robes, you won't last a day! Ouch! Ouch! You know I love you and I'll be sad to see you go. But I'd rather see you go than see something happen to you. Think about it. We'll talk later... - Silvia! - Gabriel... I have something to tell you. I'm pregnant. And in case you're wondering, this child is yours. I've been with no one else. I'm telling you in case... you want to be the father of my child. Well, goodbye. Where is Alcides? What do you mean? I know you're hiding him. Where is he? I don't have him, Ramón. Are you stealing him? I thought you were a tough guy. But only a coward would give his son away. Do whatever you want when you have kids of your own. But my son, I want mine back or I'll get him back the hard way. No, Alcides isn't going. - He isn't going. - What's going on, Ramón? The priest wants to steal my boy. Why would you want to steal Ramón's boy, Father? That's a very serious crime. Ramón may be the boy's father, but no one can force the boy to go with you, Efrain. Ramón? - Does he have him? - He's got him! Father, give Ramón his son and stop making trouble. I don't have him. Are you sure you don't have Ramón's kid? I don't have him. Check his house. Let's see if our little priest friend is lying to us... Alcides! What did you find? Nothing. Call me when you've got the boy. Good night. Take and drink all of it, because this is My blood. This is the blood of the new covenant shed for thee and for all men, so that their sins may be forgiven. Do this in remembrance of Me... This is the... This is the sacrament of our faith... We announce your death, we proclaim your resurrection, come to be. Are you out of your mind? I told you to stay well hidden, Alcides. Do you have any idea of the trouble we're in? Stay at don Pablo's and don't come out until I say so! I can come out when I want! I know you can, Alcides. But I don't want anything to happen to you. And I don't want them to hit you again because of me. So stay inside! Stay inside! Don Pablo. How are you feeling, Father? I'm fine. Come on, son. Look what they've done to you, Gabriel. Gabriel... Look at me. Get out of here. Please. Why do you have to do things this way? Alcides! Alcides, son!
