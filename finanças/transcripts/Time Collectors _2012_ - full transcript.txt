GIVE ME STRENGTH. - HELLO? - SAM? WHAT HAPPENED? THANKS FOR CALLING. BYE. - WHAT'S GOING ON? - YOUR GRANDFATHER, SAM. HE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND DIED. - WHAT? - WERE YOU ALL CLOSE WITH SAM? - WE WERE BUT WE LOST TOUCH THE LAST FEW YEARS. - I BARELY KNEW HIM. - FOR A MAN WHO HAS TOUCHED SO MANY LIVES, HIS PRIVATE LIFE SEEMS OF LATELY IS PROBABLY THE REASON WHY FEW PEOPLE WERE AT THE FUNERAL. BUT I'M GLAD YOU THREE WERE ABLE TO MAKE IT. A PORTION OF THE MONEY THAT IS LEFT TRANSFER TO THE THREE OF YOU. THERE ARE SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH PART "A" OF THE WILL TO HANDLE HIS MONEY AND PROPERTY AND ESTATE. - PART "A"? - IT SAYS PART "B" WILL NOT BE GIVEN AND WILL BE TURNED OVER TO THE DESIGNATED CHARITY UNLESS INSTRUCTIONS OF PART "A" ARE FULFILLED. - INSTRUCTIONS? - WHEN YOU FIRST CAME TO ME, HE WAS WORTH OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. I KNOW HE HAS DONE A LOT OF TRAVELING, BUT HE DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS A PERSON TO SQUANDER AND THROW AWAY HIS MONEY. WHICH MAKES MY JOB LESS PLEASANT THAN IT OTHERWISE COULD HAVE BEEN. - SO YOU'RE SAYING GRANDPA BLEW EVERYTHING HE HAD? - NOT QUITE. BUT COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING, THERE'S AN AMOUNT FOR THE SUM OF 150,000 TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN THE THREE OF YOU. AND THE CHECKS ARE HERE. BRAD. GLORIA. AND MONICA. - THAT'S ALL? THAT'S IT? THE SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS WERE TO LET US KNOW THAT GRANDPA WASTED - BRAD. - MILLIONS? - THERE'S A HOME DOWN IN TEXAS WHERE I BELIEVE SAM SPENT THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HIS LIFE. THERE'S AN OLD WAREHOUSE TOO. AND THIS IS WHERE THE SPECIAL INSTRUCTION TAKES PLACE. THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL $1.9 MILLION DOLLARS THAT GOES WITH THE PROPERTY. - THAT'S MORE LIKE IT. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE HOME IN CHICAGO? - THAT HOME WAS SOLD FOUR YEARS AGO. TO GET THE $1.9 MILLION DOLLARS, YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN THE HOME IN TEXAS FOR A YEAR. - THE THREE OF US? ALL OF US. - LIVE IN A HOUSE LIKE PRISONERS. - BUT I HAVE CLIENTS. I HAVE FRIENDS. I'M NOT LEAVING CHICAGO. - YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE. - IT DOESN'T SAY ALL THREE HAVE TO LIVE THERE. ANY COMBINATION ONE, TWO OR THREE WILL WORK. BUT TO GET THE MONEY, SOMEONE HAS TO LIVE THERE ONE YEAR. AT THE END OF ONE YEAR, YOU WILL SEE THE OTHER $1.9 MILLION DOLLARS TO DO WITH WHAT YOU WANT. - HOW WILL YOU EVEN KNOW WE'RE LIVING THERE? - YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS VERY CAREFUL WITH INSTRUCTIONS CONCERNING THE FUNDING AND ENFORCEMENT OF SECTION "A" SO DON'T GET ALARMED IF YOU SEE STRANGE VEHICLES DRIVING AROUND. - WELL, WHAT ABOUT SECTION B? - I HAVE NO FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS CONCERNING PART B. AT LEAST ONE OF YOU MUST OCCUPY THE HOME IN TEXAS WITHIN 30 DAYS OR FORFEIT THE MONEY. THIS CONCLUDES OUR MEETING. - WELL, THIS CHECK IS REALLY A BLESSING. THE CANCER'S NOT ONLY ATTACKING MY BODY BUT IT'S DESTROYED MY BANK ACCOUNT. - WELL, WE KNOW MOM CAN'T GO. SHE HAS TO GO THROUGH TREATMENTS. SO THAT MEANS IT'S BETWEEN ME AND YOU, SIS. - WELL, I HAVE MY JOB AND I'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD AND GETTING AHEAD IN MY JOB. - WELL, I HAVE MY GALLERIES AND MY FRIENDS HERE. BESIDES, I LOOKED UP PADUCAH, TEXAS ON MY PHONE AND THERE IS NOTHING THERE FOR ME. THERE'S A POPULATION OF LIKE 1400 PEOPLE. - WELL, MY FRIENDS ARE HERE TOO AND BESIDES YOU HAVE ART. ART CAN GO ANYWHERE AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SHIP. - WELL, I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE MOM LIKE THIS. - HEY, WU'S NOT DOING ANYTHING. WHY CAN'T HE GO? - IS THIS ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHERE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD? - NOPE. DO YOU? - NOT IF YOU DON'T. - WELL, I DON'T. - OKAY. - AS MUCH AS I HATE TO SAY IT, WE NEED YOU TO DO THIS. CALL ME EVERYDAY, AND IF ANYTHING HAPPENS YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET BACK HOME. I LOVE YOU. - I LOVE YOU TOO. - WU! WU! - DUDE. - DUDE, I TOTALLY GOT YOU. - LET ME SLEEP. - IS THAT AN INSULT? IS IT 'CAUSE OF THESE EYES? FINE. JUST GO TO SLEEP. JUST TRUST ME. - STOP. STOP. - WHAT? WHAT'S THE MATTER? - DUDE. WOE. - DUDE, WHAT'S WITH YOUR DRIVING? - ARE YOU KIDDING ME? - IS THIS IT? - LET ME SEE. I WAS HOPING NOT BUT - THIS IS NO MANSION. - WELL LET'S GAB OUR STUFF FOR TONIGHT AND WE'LL UNLOAD THE REST IN THE MORNING. - OH, SPIDER! - LET THE ADVENTURE BEGIN. WHERE'S THE BATHROOM? - WU? ARE YOU OKAY? WU? WU? - WU, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? WU? TALK TO ME. WHERE ARE YOU? WU? MAN. WU? - I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA DO THAT! - I'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS ALL DAY. - I'M GONNA GET YOU BACK. IN THE MEANTIME, GROW UP. - OH, IN THE MEANTIME JUST GROW UP. WHERE'S THE BATHROOM? - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - WHY IS HE WAVING AT US LIKE THAT? - I DON'T SNOW. - WHAT? I WAS TOLD WE WERE GONNA BE WATCHED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TAKING CARE OF MY GRANDPA'S WILL. - SO THEY'RE LIKE PAROLE OFFICERS OR SOMETHING? - I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT. - WHY DID WE BRING THIS MALT MAKER STUFF. - NOW THAT MY INCOME'S TAKEN CARE OF, I HAVE ALL THE TIME I NEED TO MASTER MY CRAFT. - WHY DON'T YOU JUST CHILL AND TAKE IT EASY FOR ONCE. - THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN LAYING AROUND AND PLAYING VIDEO GAMES. - WHATEVER. - I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR PRANKS! THAT'S EXACTLY YOUR PROBLEM, YOU'RE ALWAYS JOKING. - YOU'RE STILL TICKED ABOUT LAST NIGHT. - LAST NIGHT AND EVERY TIME BEFORE THAT. I NEVER SAW MY FOOD WITHOUT CHECKING THE LID, SHORT SHEETING MY BED, COOL AID IN THE SHOWER HEAD, GREASED TOILET SEATS? IT NEVER ENDS WITH YOU! - MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME. - MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY. - I'M OUT OF HERE. - HEY, BY ANY CHANCE DID YOU HAPPEN TO FIND OUT WHO THOSE TWO YOUNG MEN WERE THAT MOVED INTO SAM'S PLACE? - NO, AND I DON'T THINK I REALLY WANT TO. - WHY NOT? - BECAUSE WHEN I RAN BY THEY WERE ARGUING ON THE FRONT LAWN SO I JUST KEPT GOING. - WHAT WERE THEY ARGUING ABOUT? - WELL, I DON'T KNOW. BUT IT WAS THE CUTE ONE THAT WAS THE MOST ANGRY. - WELL, YOU KNOW HOW FRIENDS ARE ANYWAY. - YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM SAM IN A LONG TIME. I HOPE HE'S OKAY. - ME TOO. - I'M BACK. - WHERE DID YOU GO? - I WALKED THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE TOWN AND BACK. - THAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG. - NO. LISTEN, YOU WANT A PCE OF GUM? - NOT IF IT'S GONNA SNAP MY FINGER. - NO. LISTEN I'M SORRY ABOUT EARLIER. - ME TOO. - SO WHAT ARE YOU READING? - MY GRANDPA HAD A BUNCH OF BOOKS AND SCATTERED NOTES ON ARCHAEOLOGY AND PALEONTOLOGY. - WAS HE A BONE DIGGER? - I DIDN'T THINK SO. HE AND HIS DAD HAD A CABINET MAKING SHOP. MY DAD SAID IT GREW INTO A FACTORY OF OVER A THOUSAND EMPLOUS. - SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FACTORY? - HE SOLD IT. I THINK AROUND THE TIME MY GRANDMA PASSED AWAY. - WELL, IT SURE LOOKS LIKE HE LIVED WITHOUT THOSE LAST FEW YEARS OF HIS LIFE. - SURE LOOKS THAT WAY IF THIS IS ALL THAT'S LEFT. - SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THE COIN COLLECTION? - I'M GONNA HANG IT IN MY ROOM. - WHEN ARE WE GONNA GO SEE GRANDPA'S WAREHOUSE? - YOU HUNGRY? - NO. BUT I COULD EAT. - WHY DON'T WE GO AFTER WE EAT THEN. - THINK FAST. NICE. LET'S SEE WHAT HE'S GOT HERE. - THERE'S NOT EVEN ANY LIGHT BULBS. - MAYBE GRANDPA COULDN'T AFFORD THEM. - SERIOUSLY, ARE YOU REALLY THINKING ABOUT SELLING THIS STUFF? I MEAN HONESTLY, IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S WAY MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE HERE. - LIKE WHAT, MAN? STARTING A MUSEUM? BONES AND FOSSILS? I DON'T WANT TO RUN A MUSEUM. - CHECK IT OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? HERE KITTY, KITTY. SABER-TOOTH TIGER. - LOOK AT THIS. WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS? A HORN OR A TOOTH? - I THINK IT'S A TOOTH. - YEP. AND HE A CAVITY. PRETTY BAD. - WHAT IS THAT? YOU SEE IT? I HEAR THAT GIRLS LOVE DOGS. MAYBE IF YOU HAD ONE OF THESE, YOU COULD GET A GIRLFRIEND. - OH, YEAH, FOR SURE. - I DON'T WANT TO BE BY IT ANYMORE. - OH, NO WAY. ARE YOU SERIOUS? - HE HAS HIS VERY OWN MAMMOTH. - HELLO. - HE COLLECTED THESE? LIKE HE COLLECTS BUGS? OR DO YOU THINK HE BOUGHT THEM FROM SOMEWHERE? - THIS SNAKE IS NICELY WRAPPED UP. - THESE AREN'T FILES. - WHAT IS THIS, LIKE, A BACKBONE? - WHAT IS THIS? - MAN, I'M TIRED OF LOOKING. - HAVE YOU SEEN THIS? - LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. LET'S GO HOME. - YOU REALLY MUST BE FEELING BETTER TODAY. YOU'RE FEISTY. - HEY! BRAD, IS THAT YOU DOWN THERE? - I'M DOWN HERE. - WHAT'S GOING ON? - JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY I'M HERE BUT THESE BOXES DON'T SEEM VERY IMPORTANT. - WHAT'S THAT STICK FOR? - SPIDER WEBS AND A MOUSE. - A MOUSE? - YEAH, I CHASED HIM INTO THAT HOLE OVER THERE. - DID YOU GET HIM? - NOPE. ALMOST LOST THE STICK. - WHAT'S THIS? - IT'S A CAST OF SOME TRILOBITES. - YOU KNOW, I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING PRETTY RARE. - MORE RARE THAN THE STUFF IN MY GRANDPA'S WAREHOUSE? - EXACTLY. JUST LIKE WITH YOUR COINS. - YOU'RE RIGHT. THE RARER THE COIN, THE GREATER THE VALUE. MAYBE GRANDPA DIDN'T HAVE SKULLS AND TRILOBITES IN MIND. - HEY! GOOD MORNING. I'M BRAD. - GOOD MORNING. - HEY, I REALLY NEED TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE OTHER DAY. THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR MY BEHAVIOR. - SO ARE YOU A RUNNER? - NOT REALLY. DO YOU RUN EVERY DAY? - ONLY ON WEEK DAYS. YOU RELATED TO SAM? - YEAH. I'M HIS GRANDSON. - WHERE IS HE? I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM FOR A WHILE. - DID YOU KNOW MY GRANDFATHER? - YEAH, I WORKED ON SOME FLD PROJECTS WITH HIM AND IN HIS SHOP ON OCCASION. - SO YOU'RE INTO PALEONTOLOGY? - WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M A NURSE BUT I'M TAKING A COURSE IN PALEONTOLOGY AS A HOBBY. - WELL, MY GRANDFATHER'S DEAD. - OH, NO. I HAD NO IDEA. I'M SORRY. HOW DID HE DIE? - HE DROWNED WHEN HIS TRUCK WENT INTO THE RIVER. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. MY MOTHER AND SISTER AND I INHERITED MY GRANDFATHER'S HOME. - WHERE ARE THEY? - THEY'RE HOME. MY MOTHER HAS CANCER AND SHE'S UNDERGOING TREATMENTS AND MY SISTER HAS TO WORK WHILE TAKING CARE OF MY MOTHER. - WHERE IS HOME? - CHICAGO. - OH, I'LL BE THERE THIS YEAR. I'M PLANNING TO RUN THE CHICAGO MARATHON. - ARE YOU SERIOUS? - YEAH. SO WHO'S YOUR SPARRING PARTNER? - MY SPARRING PARTNER? OH, WU. YEAH, WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE GRADE SCHOOL. HE'S QUITE THE CHARACTER. HE'S ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING UP HIS SLEEVES. - IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY? - YESTERDAY, THE DAY BEFORE, AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY OTHER DAY BEFORE THAT. - IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR FRIEND'S LOOKING FOR SOME ATTENTION. - HE DOES SEEM TO WANT TO BE IN THE SPOTLIGHT ALL THE TIME. - DO YOU HAVE ANY FAMILY AROUND HERE? - NOPE. - SO YOU'LL BE LEAVING ONCE YOU FINISH UP YOUR AFFAIRS. - DON'T I WISH. WHEN THE TIME DOES COME, I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT I WILL BE QUICK TO GET OUT OF HERE. - IT'S NOT THAT BAD HERE. - NOT THAT BAD. OH, YEAH. THERE'S NO STOP LIGHTS. WU HOO! - THEN WHAT'S KEEPING YOU? - WELL, MY GRANDFATHER WROTE IN HIS WILL THAT HE NEEDED ONE OR ALL OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS TO LIVE IN HIS HOUSE FOR ONE YEAR TO GET THE WHOLE INHERITANCE. - WOW. THAT'S STRANGE. SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING'S UP. - THAT'S WHAT WU AND I THOUGHT. - HUH, SO WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE YOU CAME HERE? - I'M AN ARTIST. A SCULPTURER. - WHAT DO YOU SCULPT? - I SCULPT ABSTRACTS AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE. MAYBE I COULD SCULPT YOUR FACE SOMETIME. - I WONDER WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT SAM WANTED YOU TO STAY HERE FOR A YEAR. - I DON'T KNOW. BUT DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND GET A DRINK LATER? - NO. - NO TO THE DRINK, OR NO TO GOING OUT? - NO TO BOTH. I ACTUALLY REALLY NEED TO GET GOING. I HOPE YOU FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. - HEY, BRAD. BRAD. I DO HAVE PLANS TONIGHT AND I'M KIND OF IN CHARGE. WE'RE HAVING A CARE GROUP TONIGHT AT MY PARENT'S HOUSE AT 6:00. DO YOU THINK YOU AND WU WOULD WANT TO COME. - IS THAT A DATE? - NO. - WHAT DO YOU DO? - WELL, WE HAVE A MEAL AND THEN AFTERWARDS WE DISCUSS THINGS IN THE BIBLE. - I DON'T DO BIBLE. - OKAY.

SHE DID INVITE US TO SOME DINNER TONIGHT THOUGH. - WELL, FREE FOOD SOUNDS GOOD. - YOU ARE SO GHETTO. YOU REALLY WANT TO GO? - WHY NOT? - HEY, MOM. - HEY, MARIA, HOW WAS YOUR RUN? - IT WAS INTERESTING. THAT ONE GUY, HE'S SAM'S GRANDSON, HIS NAME'S BRAD. HE CAME OUT TO RUN WITH ME TODAY. - HE DID? - YEAH. MOM, HE TOLD ME THAT SAM DROWNED IN HIS TRUCK WHEN IT WENT INTO A RIVER. - OH, THAT'S AWFUL. SAM WAS SUCH A GOOD FRIEND. THAT EXPLAINS WHY WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM AROUND FOR A WHILE. - I KNOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S GONE. - I CAN'T EITHER. WHAT ABOUT YOU, DID YOU AND SAM HAVE ANY UNFINISHED PROJECTS? - NO, WE FINISHED THEM ALL. - THAT'S GOOD. - YEAH. - HOW ABOUT BRAD? IS HE GOING CONTINUE SAM'S WORK? - I DON'T THINK SO. HE'S JUST AN ARTIST STUCK IN SAM'S HOME FOR A YEAR. - NOW, WHY DO YOU SAY IT THAT WAY? - WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING IN SAM'S WILL THAT REQUIRES BRAD TO LIVE IN HIS HOUSE FOR A YEAR IN ORDER TO GET THE INHERITANCE. - NOW, THAT'S STRANGE. - I KNOW. - NOW WHO'S THE OTHER GUY WITH BRAD? - OH, HIS FRIEND WU. - WU? - UH-HUH. - NOW THAT'S AN INTERESTING NAME. - YEP. - WHAT'S BRAD LIKE? - WELL, HE'S NICE IN A SHALLOW KIND OF WAY. I INVITED HIM TO THE CARE GROUP TONIGHT, BUT WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT WE WOULD STUDY THE BIBLE, HE SAID, I DON'T DO BIBLE. - OH, WELL, THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT YOUR TYPE. - NO. - I'D PROBABLY BE MARRIED BY NOW IF THERE WERE MORE CHRISTIAN MEN TO CHOOSE FROM, THOUGH. - MARIA, LIVING IN A SMALL TOWN HASN'T HELPED. - HEY, CAN YOU HOLD UP ON THAT LOAD UNTIL I GET OUT OF THESE CLOTHES? - SURE, GO AHEAD. - THANKS. - HEY. - HEY, I'M WU, BRAD'S FRIEND. - OH, YEAH, WU, COME ON IN. IS BRAD COMING? - WELL, HE'S TREASURE HUNTING ACTUALLY. - WHAT KIND OF TREASURE? - I DON'T KNOW, I'M NOT THERE. - SOUNDS MYSTERIOUS. HEY, EVERYONE, THIS IS WU. HE'S A FRIEND OF BRAD'S, SAM'S GRANDSON. THEY'RE LIVING IN SAM'S HOUSE. - HEY, WU. - HEY, WU, I'M BEN. - HI, BEN. - NICE TO MEET YOU. - I'M BEVERLY, I'M MARIA'S MOTHER, AND BEN'S MARIA'S DAD. NICE TO MEET YOU. - I'M ADOPTED. - OH, OKAY. - YOU CAN HAVE A SEAT IF YOU LIKE. - HEY, I MISSED YOU AT WORK YESTERDAY. - HEY, JAMES, I WAS JUST TAKING CARE OF SOME BUSINESS. - WELL, ARE YOU GOING TO BE AT CHURCH THIS WEEKEND? - YEAH, I'LL BE THERE. - OKAY, WELL, I'LL SEE YOU THERE. - OKAY. - OKAY, MOM JUST SAID THAT THE FOOD IS READY SO DAD WILL YOU HAVE THE BLESSING? - FATHER IN HEAVEN, WE THANK YOU FOR THIS FOOD AND ALL THE BLESSINGS YOU HAVE GIVEN US THIS PAST WEEK. WE'RE THANKFUL FOR EVERYONE THAT CAME OUT THIS EVENING, INCLUDING OUR NEW FRIEND WU. MAY OUR WORDS AND ACTIONS BE A GLORY TO YOU NOW AND FOREVER. IN JESUS' NAME, WE PRAY, AMEN. - THIS REALLY SOUNDS GREAT. - BUT HE THAT SHALL ENDURE UNTIL THE END, THE SAME SHALL BE SAVED. AND THIS GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM SHALL BE PREACHED IN ALL THE WORLD FOR A WITNESS UNTO ALL THE NATIONS. AND THEN SHALL THE END COME. - THANK YOU, THAT'S GREAT, THANKS. - SURE. - SEE YOU NEXT WEEK. - HEY, CAN WE TALK? - YEAH, SURE, LET'S GO IN HERE. SO WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? - THAT WAS REALLY SOMETHING IN THERE. - I HOPE THAT'S GOOD. - YEAH. YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, I ONLY CAME HERE FOR THE FOOD BECAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T THINK THAT THIS BIBLE STUDY COULD BE SO INTERESTING, BUT I'M GLAD I CAME. I FEEL LIKE HE GOT MUCH MORE OUT OF THIS THAN JUST FOOD. - OH, WELL YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME TO COME BACK. - THANKS, BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM. I'LL BE GOING HOME SOON. - OH, I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT. IS BRAD STAYING? - YEAH, HE IS. - OKAY. - YOU KNOW, BRAD HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN SO SERIOUS. HE CHANGED WHEN HIS FATHER DIED. AND HE'S DONE A LOT FOR HIS FAMILY, STEPPING IN WHERE HIS FATHER LEFT OFF. - YEAH, HE TOLD ME HIS MOM HAS CANCER. AND THEN SAM'S DEATH, I'M SURE THAT HASN'T HELPED THINGS. - NO, HE FEELS LIKE A PRISONER HERE. BUT HE'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD GUY ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HIM. HE'S JUST BEEN HAVING THESE MOOD SWINGS LATELY, AND I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD LEAVE HIM. - WELL, I'LL CONTINUE TO PRAY FOR HIM. - WELL, WHAT I SAW IN HERE TONIGHT, I'M SURE THAT YOU GUYS COULD DO MUCH MORE. I'M ASKING YOU GUYS TO BE HIS FRIENDS. WHETHER IT'S EASY OR NOT, JUST GIVE HIM A CHANCE. - I'LL TRY. WE'LL ALL TRY. - THANKS. - HEY, YOU FOUND YOUR TREASURE? - NO, AND I'M DONE LOOKING. - DID YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR? - NOPE. SO I MADE A NEW PLAN. - WELL, I NOTICED YOU'RE WORKING ON THE HOUSE A LOT, IS THAT PART OF YOUR PLAN? - YOU KNOW, I NOTICED YOU RUNNING BY A LOT. IS YOUR MARATHON COMING UP? - THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PLACES TO RUN IN A SMALL TOWN. - WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW, I'M FIXING IT UP TO TRY AND SELL IT FOR AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, ALONG WITH THE WAREHOUSE, SO WHEN MY YEAR IS UP, I CAN MOVE BACK TO CHICAGO. - BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE THINGS YOUR GRANDFATHER'S COLLECTED OVER THE YEARS? ARE THEY JUST YARD SALE ITEMS TO YOU? - NO, THEY'RE JUST A BUNCH OF BONES THAT MEAN SOMETHING TO SOMEBODY ELSE. - YOUR GRANDFATHER GAVE HIS FORTUNE AND POSSIBLY HIS LIFE FOR SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST BONES. I BELIEVED IN WHAT HE WAS DOING. - THAT'S WHY I SHOULD GET SUCH A GOOD PRICE FOR THEM. - LOOK, I KNOW SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO SHED SOME LIGHT ON WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR OR WHAT HE FOUND. - THAT'S GREAT. YOU SHOULD INVITE THEM TO THE AUCTION. - HOW CAN YOU BE SO INSENSITIVE TO YOUR GRANDFATHER'S DREAMS? - THAT'S JUST IT, IT WAS MY GRANDFATHER'S DREAM, NOT MINE. - PLEASE DON'T DO THIS. - PLEASE DON'T MAKE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT. THE WORLD'S NOT GOING TO END IF I SELL A FEW BONES. - YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. - WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY MY GRANDFATHER DIDN'T JUST TELL ME WITH HE FOUND INSTEAD OF MESSING WITH MY LIFE. I'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO. - HEY, MARIA. - HEY, BRAD, WHAT'S WRONG WITH MARIA? - SHE'S JUST UPSET BECAUSE I WANT TO SELL EVERYTHING. - WELL, I AGREE. YOU SHOULDN'T SELL ANYTHING UNTIL YOU FIND OUT WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO BE HERE. - IF IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH BONES, IT CAN'T BE THAT IMPORTANT. - WHY DID YOU DO THAT? - THEY'RE JUST PCES OF METAL! BUT I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WOULD SPEND EVERY LAST DIME ON PCES OF METAL BECAUSE THEY'RE SO IMPORTANT FOR HIS - NOW WAIT! - NO, YOU WAIT! I WOULDN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR COIN COLLECTION IF IT WASN'T IMPORTANT TO YOU. BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE MY FRIEND, THEY'RE IMPORTANT TO ME, TOO. - THAT IS NOT THE SAME. - LET ME RAISE THE BAR THEN. DO YOU LOVE YOUR MOTHER? - YES. - WELL, IF YOU DIED, YOU WANT HER TO BE CARED FOR, RIGHT? BUT SHOULD NO ONE CARE BECAUSE IT'S NOT THEIR MOM? - WHERE ARE YOU GOING? - I'M GOING TO GO PACK MY BAGS. IT'S TIME FOR ME TO LEAVE. - HEY, HON. - HEY, DAD. - IS EVERYTHING OKAY? - DAD, YOU KNOW THAT BIG PROJECT THAT SAM WAS WORKING ON? - YES. - AND HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS AND ALL THE WORK AND MONEY THAT HE PUT INTO IT? - YES, I DO. - WELL, BRAD, SAM'S GRANDSON, JUST WANT TO TAKE EVERYTHING AND SELL IT. - EVERYTHING? - YEAH. - YOU TOLD ME BRAD WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT HE THOUGHT SAM LEFT BEHIND. DO YOU KNOW IF HE FOUND IT OR NOT? - WELL, WHEN I TALKED TO BRAD THIS MORNING, HE SAID THAT HE WAS TIRED OF LOOKING FOR IT. SO NOW HE'S JUST FIXING UP SAM'S HOME TO BE SOLD. - HE CAN'T DO THAT. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. - DAD, WHAT DO YOU KNOW? WHAT WAS IN THAT LETTER THAT SAM SENT TO YOU A FEW WEEKS AGO? - I CAN'T SAY. - YOU CAN'T SAY OR YOU WON'T SAY? - I WANT YOU TO KNOW, SAM WAS WORKING ON A PROJECT MUCH BIGGER THAN HIS WAREHOUSE. - DAD, SAM'S GONE. HOW IS HE WORKING ON ANYTHING? - AT SAM'S DEATH, THE LETTER YOU SAW WAS SENT TO ME AS PART OF HIS WILL. - SO YOU KNEW THE OTHER DAY THAT HE WAS GONE ALREADY? - YES, I WAS HOPING THAT IT WASN'T TRUE, BUT WHEN I SAW HIS BOYS MOVE INTO HIS HOME, I KNEW HE WAS GONE. I WAS JUST WAITING FOR THE RIGHT TIME TO BREAK THE NEWS, BUT BRAD BEAT ME TO IT. - SO ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME? - I'LL TELL YOU THIS MUCH, SAM ENTRUSTED ME TO MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER MOVED INTO THE HOME WOULD FULFILL THEIR END OF THE WILL. - SO THAT'S WHY YOU AND MOM HAVE BEEN TAKING MORE WALKS. SO MOM KNOWS, TOO, THEN. - SHE DOES NOW, AND IF I DON'T STOP TALKING, I'M GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE. SO JUST TRUST ME, HON. KNOW THAT WE JUST HAVE TO PRAY THAT BRAD DOESN'T SELL THE HOME. - I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO TELL ME. - YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT. - HEY, DO YOU MIND IF WE STOP BY MARIA'S SO I CAN SAY GOODBYE? I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY? - HEY, WU, WHAT'S UP? - WELL, I CAME TO SAY GOODBYE. BRAD'S TAKING ME TO THE AIRPORT. - ALREADY?

AND THAT MEANS THAT - SHE'S VALUABLE. - HEY, LISTEN. - I'LL CHECK ON YOUR MOM AND SISTER. - I APPRECIATE THAT. ♪ AND THEN ONE DAY AS I SAT ALONE... ♪ TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF MY LIFE... ♪ THAT'S WHEN YOU GRABBED ME DEEP INSIDE... ♪ AND I PRAYED TO YOU TO EASE MY STRIFE... ♪ NOW THAT I AM ON MY WAY... ♪ AND MY FUTURE'S LOOKING BRIGHT... ♪ THERE'S A HUNGER WITHIN MY SOUL... ♪ AND I'VE GOT HEAVEN IN MY SIGHTS... ♪ ARE YOU SOMEONE WHO THINKS YOU'RE ALL ALONE... ♪ CAN'T BE FORGIVEN OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE... ♪ GET ON YOUR KNEES NOW BEFORE THE LORD... ♪ AND BE LIKE THE SON... ♪ AND HE'LL SAY... ♪ NOW THAT WE ARE ON OUR WAY... ♪ AND MY FUTURE'S LOOKING BRIGHT... ♪ THERE'S A HUNGER WITHIN OUR SOULS... ♪ AND WE'VE GOT HEAVEN IN OUR SIGHTS... ♪ I'VE GOT HEAVEN IN MY SIGHTS... ♪ AND I'M ON MY WAY... - MARIA! - YEAH? - BRAD'S AT THE DOOR. - BRAD? SAM'S BRAD? - TRUCE? - I'M ALLERGIC TO SUNFLOWER SEEDS, BRAD. - BRAD, I WAS JUST KIDDING. BRAD, I WAS REALLY KIDDING, I'M SORRY! - FRIENDS? - I'M SORRY, BRAD, OF COURSE WE CAN BE FRIENDS. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? - I'M NOT SURE. HOW DO I SAY THIS? I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT MY GRANDFATHER'S COLLECTION, AND IT WAS HIS DREAM, HE'S ALREADY DEAD, SO WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHAT I DO WITH HIS STUFF? BUT I GUESS IF HIS DREAM DOES MATTER TO SOMEBODY, AND IT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO SOMEONE, THEN I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS. SO I GUESS I'M ASKING WOULD YOU, COULD YOU HELP ME TO FIND OUT WHAT MY GRANDFATHER'S DREAM WAS? - I'D LOVE TO, BRAD. - THANKS. - DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU WANT TO START? - WELL, HE DID HAVE ALL OF THESE BOOKS AND NOTES LAYING AROUND HIS HOUSE, AND THE NAME JOE TAYLOR KEPT POPPING UP. - JOE'S ONE OF MY FRIENDS. HE HAS A MUSEUM IN CROSBYTON, TEXAS. - YEAH, CROSBYTON, NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE? - HUH-HUH. - WELL, I WAS THINKING MAYBE WE COULD GO TALK TO HIM? - OKAY, WELL, WHEN DO YOU WANT TO GO? ACTUALLY, YOU NEED TO CALL FIRST TO MAKE SURE HE'S NOT OUT ON A DIG. - I DID, YESTERDAY. HE'S GOING TO BE THERE TOMORROW. - OKAY, WELL I WORK THE SECOND SHIFT, SO IS 9 A. M. OKAY? - IT'S A DATE. - OKAY. - IT'S PRETTY COOL, HUH? - YEAH, WHERE'D HE GET ALL OF THIS STUFF? - I DON'T KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO ASK HIM, THOUGH. HIS PREP ROOM IS RIGHT THERE, AND HE SHOULD BE IN IT. HEY, JOE. - HI MARIA, HOW ARE YOU? - GOOD, HOW ARE YOU? - WHO'S YOUR FRIEND? - JOE, THIS IS BRAD, SAM'S GRANDSON. HE'S LIVING IN SAM'S HOME. - HEY. - I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HEARD THAT SAM DIED? - YES, DID I, I GOT THE LETTER, THANK YOU. - OKAY, WELL WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT SOMETHING SAM MAY HAVE FOUND. - LET ME FINISH UP HERE, AND I'LL BE RIGHT OUT. - OKAY, WE'LL WAIT OUT HERE. - ALL RIGHT. - SO IS JOE A CHRISTIAN? - YES. - I'VE JUST ALWAYS ASSOCIATED DINOSAUR BONES AND FOSSILS WITH EVOLUTION. - WELL, ACTUALLY SCIENCE AND ARCHAEOLOGY ARE DOING MORE FOR CREATION THAN EVOLUTION. - HERE, COME LOOK AT THIS. SEE THIS BOWL? IT WAS FOUND IN A LUMP OF COAL THAT DATES AROUND 300 MILLION YEARS. IT WAS TAKEN FROM THE BITUMINOUS COAL SCENE DATED IN THE CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD. HUMANS WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE AROUND AT THAT TIME, SO THAT MEANS THAT THE DATING OF THE STRATA IS OFF OR WRONG ALTOGETHER. NOW, THE FLOOD BURYING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF TREES AT ONE TIME IS THE BEST EXPLANATION WE HAVE OF THE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF COAL RESERVES WE HAVE TODAY. A HUMAN ARTIFACT MADE OF METAL COULD SURVIVE SUCH AN EVENT. - YES? - WE NEED TO HURRY THIS UP. I'M TIRED OF WAITING. - YEAH, THEY'RE AT MT. BANCO. WE THINK THEY'RE GETTING CLOSE. - IF YOU HAD FOUND IT EARLIER, WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS. - YEAH, I UNDERSTAND. - THIS GUY KEEPS PULLING PEOPLE INTO HELP, THAT'S MORE PEOPLE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. DO SOMETHING! - YES, SIR. - SO ARE YOU STAYING AT SAM'S? - YEAH, FOR SOME REASON HE WANTED ME TO LIVE IN HIS HOME FOR A YEAR BEFORE I COULD GET THE INHERITANCE. - DO YOU KNOW WHY? - I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD KNOW. - WELL, SAM MUST HAVE KNOWN SOMETHING WAS UP TO HAVE WRITTEN HIS WILL THE WAY HE DID. - IS IT DANGEROUS TO COLLECT FOSSILS? - WELL, THERE ARE SOME WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING TO ADD CERTAIN ARTIFACTS TO THEIR PRIVATE COLLECTIONS. - LIKE BUY, STEAL, OR KILL? - WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT KILL, BUT THEY COULD RUIN YOU IF YOU TRIED TO STOP THEM. THERE ARE POWERFUL ORGANIZATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE CERTAIN IDEOLOGIES AND BELF SYSTEMS THAT IF A NEW SCIENTIFIC FIND OR NEW ARTIFACT IS INTRODUCED THAT DISPROVES THEIR BELFS, THEN YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER KIND OF BATTLE ON YOUR HANDS. - PUBLIC RIDICULE, ACADEMIC INSULTS, CHARACTER DEFAMATION. YOU NAME IT, THEY'VE DONE IT. - SO THERE'S A WAR GOING ON? - YES, AND THE BATTLE LINE IS DRAWN BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND SECULAR ATHEISM. - SO WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT DISPROVES EVOLUTION. - RIGHT. - WHAT WOULD THAT BE? - LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING. THIS IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES SUPPORTING CREATIONISM. - A PCE OF GRANITE? - THAT'S RIGHT. DID YOU KNOW IF YOU MELT GRANITE, IT NEVER COMES BACK AT GRANITE. - WHAT DOES IT COME BACK AS? - IT COMES BACK AS RIOLITE, A ROCK THAT NO LONGER RESEMBLES GRANITE IN LOOK, MINERAL COMPOSITION AND TEXTURE. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE GRANITE, DOES IT? - NOT AT ALL. - TELL HIM ABOUT THE RINGS. - IN THE GRANITE WHICH IS A PRIMARY CONTINENT AT BEDROCK, YOU'LL FIND POLONIUM HALO RINGS. THE POLONIUM AND ALPHA PARTICLES DECAY VERY RAPIDLY, WE'RE TALKING MINUTES. THE HALO RINGS ARE FORMED IN THE GRANITE WHEN ALPHA PARTICLES SHOOT OUT FROM THE POLONIUM SPECK. THE GRANITE CAPTURES THAT ACTION LIKE THE FILM IN A CAMERA CAPTURES AN IMAGE RAPIDLY WHEN EXPOSED. - OR LIKE BUBBLES IN WATER. THEY CAN BE CAPTURED IF YOU FREEZE THE WATER FAST ENOUGH. - OKAY. - A FELLA NAMED DR. ROBERT GENTRY HAS TAKEN THE LEAD ON THIS RESEARCH. BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THE HALO RANGE WOULD NOT BE IN THE GRANITE IF THE GRANITE WASN'T FORMED INSTANTLY. SO BACK TO MY FIRST POINT, EVOLUTIONISTS SAY THAT THE EARTH WAS COVERED BY MOLTEN LAVA, THEN OVER THE YEARS COOLED TO WHAT WE HAVE TODAY. BUT IF THE GRANITE WAS MELTED, THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY HALO RINGS YOU FIND IN MOST SOLID GRANITE OF THE EARTH. THE MELTING DESTROYS THE HALO RINGS. - SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THE EARTH HAD TO BE CREATED INSTANTLY IN ORDER FOR THE HALO RINGS TO BE CAPTURED, AND THAT FITS THE CREATION STORY BECAUSE WITHIN A WEEK AFTER GOD CREATED THE EARTH, MAN, PLANTS AND ANIMALS WERE LIVING IN SIMILAR CONDITIONS TO WHAT WE HAVE TODAY. - SOME SCIENTISTS SAY THEY PRODUCED THE GRANITE IN THE LAB, AND THERE HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF ATTEMPTS, BUT THEY'VE ALL FAILED. IT'S ONLY RIOLITE, AND RIOLITE CONTAINS NO POLONIUM HALO RINGS. - THIS IS PRETTY COOL STUFF. I'VE NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE. - WELL, TO MAINSTREAM ACADEMIA, IT'S CRYPTONITE. - WELL, WE KNOW THIS ISN'T WHAT MY GRANDFATHER WAS WORKING ON. IT'S ALREADY COVERED. - WELL, THAT'S ALL LABORATORY STUFF. FOR SAM TO BE SO CAREFUL, WE NEED TO BE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING IN THE FLD OF PALEONTOLOGY THAT HAS THE SAME EFFECT ON THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY AS THE HALO RINGS. - YOU DON'T THINK MY GRANDFATHER WAS JUST OVERLY CONCERNED OR PARANOID? - THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SAM. - NO. - I MEAN THIS COULD BE THE FIND OF THE CENTURY THAT HE KNOWS WOULD BRING OUT THOSE BONE HOUNDS WHO WANT IT IN THEIR COLLECTIONS, AND HE'S TRYING TO PROTECT IT. - FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S LOOK AT THIS. - WHOA. - HERE'S A BOOK I PUT TOGETHER. IT'S GOT QUITE A FEW THINGS IN IT THAT REFUTES THE THEORY OF EVOLUTIONISM. - IS THIS REAL? - NO, IT'S JUST A SCULPTED REPLICA, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SKELETONS OF MEN 12 FEET TALL OR TALLER FOUND ALL OVER THE EARTH. - THIS GUY WOULD BE AN N.B.A. STAR FOR SURE. - YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT MAJOR MUSEUMS DON'T HAVE GIANT SKELETONS DISPLAYED PROMINENTLY SHOULD DEMAND A QUESTION OF WHY? - SO WHY DON'T MUSEUMS DISPLAY THEM? - I THINK IT'S BECAUSE EVOLUTIONISM HAS SO DOMINATED THEIR THINKING THAT FOR SO LONG THAT ANYTHING THAT CONTRADICTS THEIR BELFS IS JUST DISMISSED. - ARE YOU SERIOUS? THAT'S NOT RIGHT. - WELL, I THINK THE AVERAGE MUSEUM STAFF AND UNIVERSITY FACULTY KNOWS GIANTS WOULD GIVE CREDIBILITY TO THE BIBLE PROVING THAT WE CAME FROM A GREATER LIFE ORDER AND NOT LESSER LIFE FORMS. BRAD DO YOU KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE OUT HERE? - SURE, THEY FOLLOW ME EVERYWHERE TO MAKE SURE I TAKE CARE OF MY GRANDPA'S WILL. - I DON'T THINK - WHAT DO YOU KNOW? - WELL, YOU KNOW THE LETTER THAT YOU GOT BEFORE SAM DIED? - YEAH. - MY DAD GOT ONE, TOO, AND IT TOLD BEHIND TO WATCH SAM'S HOME. - YOU MEAN THAT'S WHY I SEE YOUR PARENTS SO OFTEN? AND YOU'RE RUNNING AND BIKING BY MY PLACE, IS THAT JUST SPY WORK? - NO, I JUST FOUND OUT TWO DAYS AGO. - THEN WHO ARE THESE GUYS I'VE BEEN WAVING AT LIKE A DORK? - MAYBE THAT'S WHO SAM'S HIDING THIS FROM, BRAD, AND NOT YOU. YOU KNOW, THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF A CLUE HERE. - THEY'RE PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MY GRANDPA'S DEATH OR KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT. - BRAD, STOP, THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY TO HANDLE THIS! - AS LONG AS THEY'RE WATCHING YOU, YOU'RE WATCHING THEM. - I JUST SEE WHERE THIS WHOLE THING IS GOING. I NEED TO BE GOING. I'VE GOT STUFF TO DO! - DO YOU KNOW THE WAY BACK? - I THINK SO. - BE CAREFUL. - OH! YOU SCARED THE OUT OF ME. - I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU SAW ME. - I DIDN'T. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU RUN BY IN ABOUT A WEEK. HOW ARE YOU DOING? - I'M FINE. I'VE JUST HAD TO WORK 12 HOUR SHIFTS THE LAST FEW DAYS. DO YOU NEED HELP WITH THAT? - I GOT IT. HAVE A SEAT. - THANKS. - SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - I FINALLY DECIDED TO GET OFF THE COUCH AND MOVE INTO MY GRANDFATHER'S ROOM. - WELL, WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? - I KIND OF FELT LIKE I WAS TRESPASSING BUT MY BACK TOLD ME TO GET OVER IT. - WU MENTIONED TO ME THAT YOUR MOM HAS CANCER, IS SHE DOING OKAY? - OTHER THAN BEING BALD? SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE. - THAT'S GOOD. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY BONE MAFIA AROUND LATELY? - ALMOST EVERY DAY. HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT ANYMORE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE? - NO, BUT WHAT YOU AND JOE SHARED WITH ME THE OTHER DAY ABOUT THE GRANITE AND THE IRON BOWL AND THE COAL, HELPED ME REALIZE THERE REALLY IS A MISSION HERE. - THAT'S GREAT, I'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR YOU EVERY NIGHT. - THANKS. YOU KNOW, I'VE WATCHED A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMS AND READ A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC MAGAZINES, BUT I'VE PROBABLY ONLY BEEN EXPOSED TO ABOUT ONE PERCENT OF EVERYTHING THAT'S OUT THERE. WHAT I FEEL LIKE I NEED HERE IS SOMEWHERE IN THE OTHER 99%. - THAT'S AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE. - I PICKED UP THE BIBLE A COUPLE OF TIMES THIS WEEK. - AND? - I FEEL LIKE IT'S KIND OF LIKE MY GRANDPA'S MYSTERY. I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START. - NORMALLY I WOULD TELL YOU TO START WITH THE GOSPELS AND READ ABOUT THE LIFE OF CHRIST, BUT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THE BIBLE'S DIVINE OR IS THE WORD OF GOD, IT WON'T DO YOU MUCH GOOD AT THIS POINT. - YEAH. IF YOU CAN'T KICK START ANY ATTITUDE ABOUT THE BIBLE THE WAY YOU DID ABOUT CREATION, I DON'T THINK IT WILL HAPPEN. - THERE IS A BOOK IN THE BIBLE, THE BOOK OF DANL, THAT'S WONDERFUL FOR THIS KIND OF SITUATION, ACTUALLY. IT'S SO POWERFUL THAT THERE'S A RABBINICAL CURSE FOR ANY JEW WHO READS IT. EVEN THOUGH IT'S PART OF THE CANON. - WHY WOULD THERE BE A CURSE ON PEOPLE FOR READING THE BIBLE? - WELL, IT'S A PARANOIA CURSE, A SCARE TACTIC. NOTHING HAPPENS TO ANYONE WHO READS IT BESIDES THEIR LIFE CHANGING FOR THE BETTER. BUT FOR A JEW, IT'S THE MOST POWERFUL BOOK IN THE BIBLE THAT PROVES THAT JESUS IS THE MESSIAH. EVEN ATHEISTS DON'T WANT THEIR FRIENDS TO READ IT BECAUSE THEY BECOME BELIEVERS. - SOUNDS LIKE I SHOULD CHECK IT OUT. - YEAH, ACTUALLY MY DAD HAS A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC. WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER FOR DINNER, AND HE CAN SHARE SOME OF THAT INSIGHT WITH YOU? - WELL, THAT WILL SAVE HIM A TRIP. - WHAT? - HE WON'T HAVE TO WALK BY. - OH. SO YOU'LL COME? - IF YOU'RE SURE IT'S OKAY. - YEAH, TRUST ME, THEY'D LOVE IT IF YOU CAME. MAYBE MY DAD WILL SHARE SOMETHING FROM THAT 9b 0WITH YOU. - IT'S A DATE. GOTCHA! SEE YOU MARIA. - BYE. - I'LL CALL YOU WHEN HE COMES BACK, OKAY? - THAT WAS A GREAT MEAL. - WELL, THANK YOU, BRAD, I APPRECIATE THAT. - WHY DON'T WE ALL GO IN THE LIVING ROOM? I THINK WE'LL BE MORE COMFORTABLE THERE. - SOUNDS GOOD. BRAD, LEAVE THAT, WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. - IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN THE BIBLE, THEN HOW DO YOU USE THE BIBLE TO ESTABLISH YOUR FAITH IN THE BIBLE? - I DON'T KNOW. - WELL, FORTUNATELY, THE BIBLE IS BOTH HISTORICAL AND PROPHETIC. SO LET'S GO TO DANL 9. HERE WE GET A GREAT DESCRIPTION OF GOD AND HOW UNIQUE HE IS. BEFORE WE READ, I NEED YOU TO READ THIS. - 605 TO 538 B. C. - HISTORICALLY, DANL WAS WRITTEN OVER 500 YEARS BEFORE CHRIST. WHAT THIS SAYS TO ME IS THAT GOD CAN WALK THROUGH TIME LIKE YOU AND I WALK OUT TO THE MAILBOX AND COME BACK. HE CAN TRAVEL TO THE FUTURE AND GATHER SEGMENTS OF TIME, BRING THEM BACK TO A RIGHTEOUS PERSON WHO WILL HONESTLY AND FAITHFULLY WRITE IT DOWN IN A BOOK. - IN THE BIBLE? - THAT'S RIGHT. NO ONE, NOT EVEN SATAN, CAN DO THAT. - YOU SEE, AS CHRISTIANS, WE'RE TIME COLLECTORS. WE HAVE A COLLECTION OF THOSE SEGMENTS OF TIME GIVEN TO US IN GOD'S WORD AS FAITH BUILDERS AND AS A GUIDE TO THE ACTIONS OF GOD IN THE FUTURE. - SO IT'S KIND OF THE OPPOSITE OF MY GRANDFATHER. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - HE COLLECTS SEGMENTS OF TIME FROM THE PAST SUCH AS FOSSILS AND ARTIFACTS AND HE'S FOUND. - YOU KNOW, MOST OF THE NEW TESTAMENT WAS DEVOTED TO PROVING HOW JESUS FULFILLED OLD TESTAMENT PROPHECIES. WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE FIRST COMING OF CHRIST. BEVERLY, WOULD YOU READ VERSE 24? - 70 WEEKS ARE DETERMINED UPON THY PEOPLE AND UPON THY HOLY CITY TO FINISH THE TRANSGRESSION AND TO MAKE AN END OF SINS, AND TO MAKE RECONCILIATION FOR INIQUITY AND TO BRING IN EVERLASTING RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND TO SEAL UP THE VISION AND PROPHECY AND TO ANOINT THE MOST HOLY. - THAT'S QUITE A FEW THINGS THAT HAPPENED WHEN CHRIST COMES THE FIRST TIME. FIRST YOU GOT THE WARNING TO THE JEWS, DANL'S PEOPLE. NEXT FOUR POINTS DEAL WITH THE SIN PROBLEM, AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE SIXTH WHICH IS FINISH THE VISION. THE SEVENTH IS THE ANOINTING OF THE MOST HOLY. MARIA, WOULD YOU READ VERSE 25 PLEASE? - NOW THEREFORE, AND UNDERSTAND THAT FROM THE GOING FORTH OF THE COMMANDMENT TO RESTORE AND TO BUILD JERUSALEM UNTO THE MESSIAH, THE PRINCE SHALL BE 7 WEEKS AND THREE SCORES AND TWO WEEKS. THE STREETS SHALL BE BUILT AGAIN AND THE WALL EVEN IN TROUBLED TIMES. - THE COMMAND TO REBUILD JERUSALEM WAS GIVEN BY XERXES IN EZRA 7:11-26 IN THE FALL OF 457 B. C. NOW, ACCORDING TO PROPHECY, IT WOULD BE 69 WEEKS OR 483 YEARS UNTIL THE MESSIAH. NOW, THE NAME MESSIAH MEANS ANOINTED ONE. IT WAS AT CHRIST'S BAPTISM THAT HE'D BE ANOINTED BY A SPECIAL OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. AND THAT'S WHEN HE BEGAN HIS MINISTRY. NOW, IT'S A WELL-KNOWN FACT AMONG BIBLICAL SCHOLARS THAT ONE DAY IN PROPHECY EQUALS A YEAR. SO DANL WAS TALKING ABOUT 483 YEARS. FROM THE TIME THE COMMAND WAS GIVEN TO REBUILD JERUSALEM IN THE FALL OF 457 B. C. TO THE TIME JESUS WAS BAPTIZED IN A. D. 27, THAT'S 483 YEARS. - SO JESUS WAS PRECISELY ON TIME. SO ANYONE CLAIMING TO BE THE MESSIAH THAT CAME BEFORE OR AFTER THAT DATE HAS TO BE A FRAUD. - WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LAST WEEK? - LET'S LOOK AT VERSE 27, AND HE, THIS IS JESUS, SHALL CONFIRM THE COVENANT WITH MANY FOR ONE WEEK. NOW, THIS IS THE 70TH WEEK. AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK, HE, JESUS, SHALL CAUSE THE SACRIFICE AND THE ABLATION TO CEASE. THE MESSIAH WOULD BE CUT OFF. BY GIVING HIS LIFE, BY BECOMING THE LAMB OF GOD HIMSELF, HE WOULD CAUSE THE SACRIFICES TO HAVE NO MORE MEANING, THUS THEY WOULD CEASE. AND THIS HAPPENED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 70TH WEEK HALFWAY THROUGH THE 7 YEARS MAKING UP THE LAST WEEK. JESUS WAS CRUCIFIED IN THE SPRING OF A.D. 31 MAKING HIS MINISTRY THREE AND A HALF YEARS. - AGAIN JESUS WAS PRECISELY ON TIME. IF HE HADN'T BEEN, HOW COULD HE CLAIM TO BE THE MESSIAH? THIS IS THE FULFILLMENT OF DANL'S PROPHECY IN COLD, HARD, INDISPUTABLE ARITHMETIC THAT JESUS WAS WHO HE CLAIMED TO BE. - BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER THREE AND A HALF YEARS? - IN A.D. 34 AT THE END OF THE 70TH WEEK, THREE AND A HALF YEARS AFTER THE ASCENSION OF JESUS, STEVEN WAS STONED PREACHING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HISTORY LESSON ABOUT JESUS WHO WAS THE ANOINTED ONE. HERE PROBATION FOR THE JEWS ENDS AS A NATION, NOW, AND NOW THE GOSPEL CAN GO OUT TO THE GENTILES. - PRECISELY ON TIME. - AND YOU CAN FIND THIS IN ACTS CHAPTER 7. - THAT'S QUITE A KICK! - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - KICK START. - IT'S ALL GOOD. - LET'S GO OVER ISAIAH 53. (LAUGHING) - THAT WAS GOOD. - OH, BRAD I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT TONIGHT. - THANK YOU FOR A GREAT MEAL. BEST I'VE HAD IN WEEKS. - WELL, YOU'RE MOST WELCOME. THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM. - NOW YOU'RE TEMPTING ME. - I HOPE IT WORKS. - BRAD, YOU CAN COME BACK ANY TIME. - SOUNDS GOOD. - IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU. - YOU TOO. - GOOD NIGHT. - GOOD NIGHT. CAREFUL GOING HOME. - THEY CAN BE OVERBEARING SOMETIMES. - YEAH. THIS WAS GOOD. - I'M REALLY GLAD YOU HAD A GOOD TIME. - GOOD TIME. GOOD FOOD. GOOD INSIGHT AND GREAT COMPANY. - WELL, AS MY MOM SAYS THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM. - THANKS FOR NOT GIVING UP ON ME. - I'LL SEE YOU SOON. (WHISTLING) (MUSIC) (LIGHTNING CRASHING) (MUSIC) (LIGHT CLICKS OFF) (LIGHTNING AND THUNDER CRASH) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) - YEAH, I CHASED HIM INTO THAT HOLE OVER THERE. - DID YOU GET HIM? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) - OH. THERE IT IS! (HAMMER SLAMMING AGAINST THE WALL) (BRICKS BOOMING TO THE GROUND) - ARE YOU KIDDING ME? (MUSIC) (THUNDER CRASHES) (MUSIC) - DEAR FAMILY AT LEAST I HOPE YOU'RE FAMILY. OBVIOUSLY I'M GONE. THE CHEST PAINS OF LATE MADE ME REALIZE I DIDN'T HAVE LONG ENOUGH TO SEE MY PLANS THROUGH SO I'VE LEFT IT UP TO YOU TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH MY DREAM. NOW THAT YOU FOUND SAMMY, YOU ARE RELEASED FROM PART A OF THE WILL. YOU CAN SELL THE HOME, THE WAREHOUSE OR WHATEVER ELSE YOU WANT BUT BEFORE YOU DO, HERE WERE MY PLANS, TO BUILD A MUSEUM THAT HOUSED THE BEST ARCHEOLOGICAL FINDS AND SCIENTIFIC PROOFS KNOWN TO MAN THAT SUPPORTS CREATION, A PLACE WHERE THE NAME OF JESUS CAN BE FREELY SPOKEN. BY THE WAY, OLD FRIEND, I'VE GOT A HOME FOR YOU AND SONNY. A SCHOOL THAT SPECIALIZES IN CREATION SCIENCE AND A PLACE IN AMERICA THAT IS NOT AFRAID TO PUT ON DISPLAY THE WHOLE TRUTH LIKE BIG SAMMY, A 12 FOOT TALL HUMAN SKELETON. THOUGH RARE, THESE GIANTS ARE MORE COMMON THAN YOU THINK. IN THE BIBLE THERE ARE MORE THAN 20 TRIBES OF GIANTS MENTIONED AND 21 NAMED GIANTS. GOLIATH BEING THE MORE POPULAR. GIANT SKELETONS ARE SHOWN IN MUSEUMS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD, BUT HERE IN THE STATES FUNDING WOULD BE LOST IF ANYTHING THAT SUPPORTED CREATION WAS DISPLAYED. FOR THEM THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE. MY ROLE HAS BEEN LIKE KING DAVID WHO COLLECTED AND BOUGHT MATERIALS FOR THE TEMPLE BUT IT WAS LEFT FOR HIS SON, SOLOMON, TO BUILD IT. I HAVE DONE THE SAME FOR YOU. HERE IS AN ADDITIONAL 40 MILLION DOLLARS TO SEE THE DREAM THROUGH. EVERYTHING IS AT THE READY. IF YOU WANT IT CAN BECOME YOUR DREAM AS WELL. BUT I'D RATHER HAVE SOMEONE I LOVE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT MY WORK THAN THOSE I DON'T KNOW. I BELIEVE THAT IF I MADE FINDING SAMMY THE ADVENTURE THEN YOU'D FEEL THE VALUE THAT I FELT FINDING THE FOSSILS. (CELL PHONE RINGS) - HELLO. - HEY, MARIA. GOOD MORNING. - GOOD MORNING. HOW ARE YOU? - I'M GOOD. I HAVE A BIG FAVOR TO ASK YOU. - OKAY. WHAT'S THAT? - CAN YOU MEET AT THE LIBRARY AT 10 O'CLOCK? I HAVE SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT TO SHARE WITH YOU. - YEAH. IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? - YES. EVERYTHING IS GREAT. AND YOU'RE SURE YOU CAN BE THERE IN A HALF HOUR? - YEAH. - OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU THERE AT 10. - OKAY. OKAY. BYE. - BYE. (MUSIC) (CELL PHONES RINGS. - HELLO. - HELLO, MARIA? - YEAH. - HEY, SOMETHING CAME UP AND I CAN'T MAKE IT. CAN YOU MEET ME IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE? - BRAD, WHAT'S GOING ON? - I'LL TELL YOU WHEN YOU GET HERE. - OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU IN A FEW MINUTES. (MUSIC) - HE NEVER SHOWED UP. - HELLO? HEY, MOM. - LET'S SEE WHERE SHE'S GOING. - WHAT'S GOING ON? IS MONICA CRYING? - YEAH. SHE WAS GOING TO CALL YOU BUT SHE HANDED THE PHONE OVER TO ME. - WHY IS SHE CRYING? ARE YOU OKAY? - I'M FINE. IT'S WU. HE WAS IN A BAD CAR ACCIDENT. - IS HE OKAY? - NO. HE'S GONE. - YOU MEAN GONE LIKE IN DEAD? - YES. HE WAS CRUSHED IN THE CAR BY A TRUCK. - I'VE GOT TO GET HOME. - THEY'RE GOING TO BURY HIM TODAY. IT'S A CLOSED CASKET. - WHY AM I JUST HEARING ABOUT THIS? - I DON'T KNOW. YOU HAVE NOT BEEN AROUND. - SOMEONE DROPPED THE BALL BIG TIME! - THEY SAID HE DIDN'T FIND OUT UNTIL LATE LAST NIGHT BECAUSE HE WAS OUT OF TOWN. - MOM, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS! WHY? FIRST DAD. NOW YOU ARE CANCER THEN SAM DIED. NOW WU IS GONE. WHY IS GOD DOING THIS TO US? - I DON'T KNOW. - THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK. THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK! (THUNDER CRASHES) - BRAD, ARE YOU THERE? BRAD, TALK TO ME. - I GOT TO LET YOU GO. - ARE YOU GOING TO BE OKAY? DO YOU NEED MONICA TO COME DOWN? - I DON'T KNOW. I'LL CALL YOU LATER. - OKAY. I LOVE YOU. - I LOVE YOU, TOO. I GOT TO GO. - OKAY. BYE. (MUSIC) - DID THEY SHOW UP AT THE LIBRARY? - YEAH. WHAT'S WRONG? - MY HOUSE IS BUGGED. - THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP TO SEE IF THEY WERE LISTENING TO YOUR CALL? - THAT'S RIGHT. - SOMETHING ELSE IS WRONG, BRAD. - WU IS DEAD. HE WAS KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT. - OH NO! - THE LAST TIME WE TALKED IT WASN'T ON SUCH GOOD TERMS. I NEVER MADE IT RIGHT. - BRAD, I'M SORRY. - AND TO TOP IT OFF THE FUNERAL IS TODAY. I CAN'T EVEN SHOW MY RESPECTS. - CAN WE PRAY? - NO. WE CAN'T PRAY. - WHY NOT? - I TRIED TO GIVE GOD A CHANCE BUT IF THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING HIM, THIS IS JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. - I SHOULD HAVE WARNED YOU, BRAD. - ABOUT WHAT? - THAT SATAN ATTACKS THOSE SEEKING GOD. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRAYING MORE. - YOU THINK THAT WOULD HAVE KEPT WU FROM DYING? - NO. GOD DOESN'T ALWAYS KEEP US FROM THE FIRE. BUT HE CAN HELP US GO THROUGH IT. - I'M ALL BURNED OUT. YOU AND YOUR GOD NEED TO BE GOING. - YOU CAN'T MEAN THAT. - STOP! I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYMORE. - NO, BRAD. YOU STOP. I HAVE ONE LAST THING YOU'VE GOT TO HEAR. WHILE YOU'RE HAVING YOUR PITY PARTY REMEMBER THAT GOD HAS NEVER ASKED ANYONE TO BEAR MORE OR GO THROUGH MORE THAN HE DID AT THE CROSS FOR YOU. BE NOBLE IN YOUR SUFFERING. JESUS ASKED IF THE CUP COULD BE TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM AND IT WASN'T. AS A KING HE DIED FOR US WITH HUMILITY. (RAIN FALLS AND THUNDER CRASHES) (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) - OH, MARIA, IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S HURTING TO THE POINT HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK. - BUT HE WAS SO ANGRY. AND I COULD TELL THAT HE'D BEEN CRYING. I DON'T KNOW IF GOD OR US CAN TURN THIS AROUND. HE WAS SO SURE OF HIMSELF WHEN HE LEFT. (MARIA SNIFFLES) - TIME HAS A WAY OF HEALING THINGS. GIVE HIM A FEW DAYS TO COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS. TAKE HIM A SUNFLOWER. - THANKS. - THAT'S TRUE. - SO HOW ARE YOU DOING? - WELL, I'M DOING OKAY. THE THING THAT REALLY HURTS THE MOST ABOUT WU'S DEATH IS THAT I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO TELL HIM I WAS SORRY FOR THE WAY I TREATED HIM BEFORE I LEFT. - BUT YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY, YOU DIDN'T YOU SAY YOU WERE SORRY THEN? WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? - I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THAT. - WELL, YOU WERE KIND OF OUT OF IT. - BUT GOD KNEW. - KNEW WHAT? - YOU NEED TO TELL HIM YOU'RE SORRY. - EXCUSE ME? - YOU NEED TO TELL HIM YOU'RE SORRY. - WELL, HE SENT THIS LITTLE GIRL, GAVE HER A VISION AND HE TOLD HER THAT I NEEDED TO APOLOGIZE TO WU. SHE TOLD ME THAT. - YOU NEVER TOLD ME ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. - WELL, I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT BUT NOW IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE. GOD IS REAL AND HE CAN WALK THROUGH TIME. HE KNEW THAT ALL OF THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. AND AT FIRST I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET HER VOICE OUT OF MY HEAD BUT IT REALLY WORKED. I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF IT SINCE. - SO DO YOU FEEL BETTER? - I REALLY FEEL A LOT BETTER. - I'M SO GLAD. SO WHAT ABOUT THAT PLAN OF YOURS? - SHHH. WHISPER. YOU DON'T KNOW THESE GUYS. THEY'RE POSSESSED. - WHAT IF THEY FIND OUT? WON'T THAT MAKE IT WORSE? - I JUST CAN'T LET THIS SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS. I HAVE TO TAKE A RISK. - WE HAVE TO TAKE A RISK. BESIDES I WON'T ONE-THIRD OF HALF THAT SKELETON WHICH EQUALS SOMETHING LIKE - ONE SIXTH. - RIGHT. ONE SIXTH. WHICH DOESN'T SEEM LIKE VERY MUCH. - ANYWAY I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE. - I'M GLAD I'M HERE. - I REALLY NEEDED YOU. - I KNOW. - I NEEDED THAT, TOO. GO AHEAD. - LATER YOU CAN DO MY SHOULDERS. - I THINK I NEED TO GO TO BED. - WHAT? YOU ALWAYS DO THAT WHEN IT'S MY TURN! (MUSIC) - MARIA, WHAT'S WRONG? - HE'S IMPOSSIBLE! - WHO? BRAD? - YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT. I FOUND HIM WITH ANOTHER GIRL TONIGHT. - OH, MARIA, I'M SORRY. - I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I'M SO MAD BUT I NEVER WANT TO SEE HIS FACE AGAIN. - MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE YOU WERE HOPEFUL AND IT DIDN'T TURN OUT LIKE YOU THOUGHT. - YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL. - LOOK AT THIS. - TV NEWSCASTER:THE STORY IS STILL DEVELOPING. THE EARTHQUAKE ROCKED THIS IMPOVERISHED COUNTRY OF HAITI THIS AFTERNOON. (CELL PHONE RINGS) - HELLO, THIS IS MARIA. YEAH. I'M WATCHING IT RIGHT NOW. GO TO HAITI? SURE. - BUT WHAT ABOUT WORK? - THAT WAS WORK. IT'S GOOD PR FOR THE HOSPITAL AND SMART TO OVER STAFFED WORKERS IN A DISASTER LIKE THIS. - HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO BE GONE? - ONE OR TWO WEEKS. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE LONGER. - BUT WHAT IF BRAD CALLS? WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY? - I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HIM SO JUST TELL HIM I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY. - HEY, IT'S MARIA. SORRY I MISSED YOUR CALL. LEAVE A MESSAGE. - WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO CALL? - MARIA. THE OTHER DAY I TOLD HER ABOUT WU DIED BUT I FORGOT TO TELL HER ABOUT - MAYBE GRANDPA DOESN'T WANT HER TO KNOW. - MAYBE IT'S FOR HER BEST INTEREST. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. - I JUST CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THIS THING IS OVER WITH SO WE CAN GET YOU HOME. - YEAH, ME TOO. (PLANE ENGINE RUMBLES) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (MUSIC) - WHEN I THOUGHT I'D BE MAKING SOME SCULPTURES WHEN I CAME BACK HERE, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE CASTING ANYTHING LIKE THIS. CAREFUL. (MUSIC) - I NEED A LITTLE HELP. (MUSIC) - OVER IT LIKE THIS. - OKAY. AWESOME. (MUSIC) - SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? - WELL, DO YOU THINK WE'RE READY TO PAINT? - YEAH, I DO. LET'S GET THE STUFF. - COOL. (MUSIC) - I THINK THAT'S GOING TO DO IT. - IT DOES LOOK REALLY GOOD. - YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. - YEAH. NO PROBLEM. - JUST FOR BEING HERE. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I'LL TAKE THIS. - OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU UPSTAIRS. - OKAY. (MUSIC) - I CAN'T BELIEVE WE FOUND IT! - IT'S MAGNIFICENT! - I JUST HAVE TO SHARE THE NEWS. - WHO ARE YOU GOING TO CALL? - LET'S CALL MOM FIRST. SHE WOULD WANT TO KNOW. HEY MOM. GUESS WHAT? YEAH. WE FOUND IT AND IT'S HUGE? IT'S A GIANT HUMAN SKELETON. WE FOUND IT IN THE BASEMENT BEHIND A BLOCK WALL. THERE WAS A NOTE PAINTED ON THE CEILING IN SAM'S ROOM ABOVE THE BED IN GLOW IN THE DARK PAINT SO HE COULDN'T SEE IT IN THE DAYTIME. I'VE BEEN SLEEPING ON THE COUCH BUT THE FIRST NIGHT IN THERE I FOUND IT. HEY MOM, I FORGOT. MONICA AND I ARE GOING OUT TONIGHT TO CELEBRATE. WE NEED TO MAKE SOME RESERVATIONS.

I'M JUST GOING TO HIDE RIGHT HERE AND GET SOME FOOTAGE AND SEND IT IN. - THIS MUST BE WHERE IT IS. - WOW. LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS THING. IS IT HUMAN? - I DON'T KNOW. IT'S BIG. - IS IT A MAN OR A WOMAN. - I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA BUT I THINK I KNOW WHY THE OLD MAN WAS SO CAREFUL. - WE HAVE TO DESTROY IT? - THAT'S WHAT WE GET PAID FOR. LET'S GET THE GUYS AND GET THIS THING OUT OF HERE. OKAY? - THEY'RE COMING OUT. - ALL RIGHT. LET'S BE CAREFUL. - YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING CAREFUL. WE GOT ALL NIGHT.

BUT THE DEATH SEEMED SUSPICIOUS SO THEY TOOK A LITTLE EXAMPLE INTRODUCE TIME PERFORMING THE AUTOPSY. - SO WHAT HAPPENED? - DROVE OFF INTO THE RIVER. TRIED TO GET OUT OF HIS TRUCK BUT HE COULDN'T GET BACK TO THE SHORE. IT WAS DOWN RIVER AFTER THAT. - SO HE HAPPENED TO BE DOWN BY THE RIVER AND HAD A HEART ATTACK AND DROVE INTO THE RIVER AND THEN DIED FLOATING DOWN THE RIVER. IS THAT RIGHT? - THAT'S THE WAY IT LOOKS, BRAD. - WHAT ABOUT MY VISITORS THE OTHER NIGHT? I CAUGHT THEM RED HANDED. IT'S ON VIDEO. - I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT BUT I KEEP RUNNING INTO DEAD ENDS AND ROAD BLOCKS. MY HANDS ARE TIED. - SO WHAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE? - IT LOOKS LIKE I NEED MORE RESOURCES THAN I HAVE. AT THIS POINT, BRAD, I'M GOING TO ADVISE YOU TO HAVE SOMEONE ELSE TAKE THIS OWN. - AT THIS POINT I ADVISE YOU TO GET A BACKBONE. (MUSIC) - HEY. THANKS AGAIN FOR EVERYTHING. - YOU ARE WELCOME. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO LEAVE EVERYTHING IN THAT HOUSE? - YEAH. I'VE GOT EVERYTHING I NEED. - WELL, IT SHOULD SELL PRETTY QUICKLY AT THAT PRICE.

WELL, GET BUSY. - ALL OF THIS OVER A REPLICA? - I CAN'T BELIEVE HE CAUGHT US ON TAPE. (MUSIC) - MARIA, IT'S BEEN ALMOST TWO MONTHS. WHY DON'T I GIVE BRAD A CALL? - DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL FOR ME OR FOR YOU? - I JUST THINK WE ALL WOULD KIND OF LIKE TO KNOW HOW HE'S DOING. - MOM, I CAN'T. BESIDES JAMES AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING LATELY. - JAMES. JAMES HAS NEVER BEEN YOUR TYPE. WHY NOW? - MAYBE BECAUSE LOOKING FOR A GOOD MAN IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ONE THAT I WANT. - WHY NOT BOTH? IN SAM'S LETTER HE WAS HOPING WE'D HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET HIS FAMILY AND THAT WE'D BE ABLE TO WITNESS IN A WAY HE NEVER COULD. I JUST FEEL BAD THAT WE COULDN'T DO MORE. - YEAH, I FEEL LIKE I FAILED HIM BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW - I WONDER HOW JESUS FELT ABOUT JUDAS. (MOWER RUNNING) - MR.

WHAT IS THE WE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT? - MY MOM AND SISTER. - HOW IS YOUR MOM DOING. - SHE'S DOING REALLY GOOD. SHE'S TOTALLY RECOVERED FROM THE CANCER. AND WHAT'S YOUR BABY'S NAME? - HIS NAME IS JOSIAH. BUT HE'S NOT MINE. I'M WATCHING HIM FOR A FRIEND. - OH. SO YOU'RE NOT MARRIED? - NO. YOU? - NO. BUT I'M GOING TO. - HEY.

I WAS BAPTIZED SHORTLY AFTER LEAVING TEXAS. - BRAD, I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU. HOW? - WELL, MY SISTER CAME TO VISIT ME A FEW DAYS AFTER WU DIED. AND I WAS TELLING HER HOW DEVASTATED I WAS I NEVER GOT TO APOLOGIZE TO HIM AND SHE REMINDED ME THAT I DID EVEN THOUGH SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHY. ANYWAY THAT REMINDED ME OF THIS GIRL AT AN ART GALLERY I WAS AT WHO IS LIKE A CHILD PRODIGY AND SHE GETS VISIONS FROM GOD. AND WAS TOLD TO TELL ME THAT I NEEDED TO APOLOGIZE TO WU. I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY. I THOUGHT IT WAS CRAZY AT THE TIME. BUT LOOKING BACK I KNOW THAT GOD WAS THERE THE WHOLE TIME THOUGH I DIDN'T KNOW IT. - THAT'S SO WONDERFUL. I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU. SO THAT WAS YOUR SISTER? - YEAH. - I CAME BY YOUR HOUSE TO SEE IF YOU WERE OKAY AND I SAW YOU GUYS TOGETHER. I THOUGHT YOU WERE WITH ANOTHER GIRL. - SO THAT'S WHY YOUR MOM SOUNDED SO ANGRY ON THE PHONE AND WHY YOU NEVER RETURNED ANY OF MY CALLS. - I WENT TO HAITI THE NEXT DAY. I DIDN'T HAVE SIGNAL ON MY PHONE FOR WEEKS AND THEN MY PHONE WAS SMASHED AT THIS AIRPORT WHEN ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE HIT. MY FRIENDS AND I WERE ALMOST TRAMPLED. I THOUGHT YOU HATED ME. - I THOUGHT YOU HATED ME. - NO. QUITE THE CONTRARY. I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOU OR PRAYING FOR YOU. - I NEVER HATED YOU. AND I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I EVER HAD THE CHANCE I WOULD TELL YOU HOW SORRY I WAS FOR NOT LOVING YOU THE WAY THAT I DO NOW. - YOU LOVE ME? - YES. - I ARE YOU SURE? - I DO. - BY THE POWERS INVESTED IN ME BY THE GREAT STATE OF TEXAS, I PRONOUNCE YOU HUSBAND AND WIFE. YOU MAY NOW KISS YOUR BRIDE. (MUSIC) - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I PRESENT TO YOU MR. AND MRS. BRAD ADAMS.
