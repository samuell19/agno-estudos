If we do a good job, we'll go up to higher level. Mr. Mudakir says, the difference In every level Is the clients. But these ladies who are supposedly the lowest ones, they look fine to me. I hope I get a left handed woman. They say left handed women reach orgasms faster. Really? Because they can masturbate with both hands. Damn it! I left handed but I don't orgasm prematurely. That theory only applies to women. Well, your momma sure is left handed. My momma was a man. Drop down your uniform. See, watch that, you all look happy now. Wow! I bet you're in your momma's womb for more than 9 months. 9 months and half, dude. If more than 9 months, the torpedo's is bigger than normal. Then Marley must've been in the womb for only 7 months. It's the air conditioning, man. Makes my dick shrink. Okay, pull up your pants. See you later, dudes! See you later, dudes! Did I keep you waiting? Well later we can talk as long as you like.

You'll be playing with my patient. Madam! Man, too small. Now, read that book. Open and read it, baby. This is Budi. This is Budi's mother. This is Budi's father. This is Budi's sister.

This is the greatest job I could ever get. And not only that, I also get great friends. What fishes are those? Lo Han. This one called Lindsay. They were on sale at the pet shop at the mall. It's freakin cheap, Only 100 thousand rupiahs (US$10 each). I bought 40 of 'em. You know how much they're worth. Once they're full grown? Millions, man! In only 2 months... I could now have the things I never dreamt of having before. Maybe what they say is true the Lo Han fish brings luck. No work doesn't feel hard anymore. Everything can be handled. I feel like I have no bones left in my body now. How many did you get today? / Two. And you? Three. / And you, Marley? Nine. / You got nine? What the hell are you on, man? Viagra? I never touch that stuff. What is this? Admit it! You're on drugs. That's why you could go on so long. Then what the hell is this? I told you not to come. It's a boys' night out. Are Mandy and Mindy boys? / Which one do you prefer? A hot girl who's always jealous... ...or an ugly girl who doesn't care what you do I'd take a hot girl who lets me do whatever I want. No, you got to choose one or the other. You know, if you're like jealous all the time... ...then your boyfriend will, like, cheat on you. It's "The Devil's Blow"/ What? It's called "The Devil's Blow" To use it, you break the top and soak it in warm water. Then rub it on your 'tool,' like this. Underneath. At the top. Where did you get it? From Mr. Mudakir. He bought it in Saudi Arabia. Must be credible. / You guys don't need this, right? Says who? We all need it. Let me try it now. / Let me try some too. Pizza delivery boys must be getting good pays these days... ...if they can hang out at places like this. Isn't this place supposed to be for young executives? They're executives too. Executives are people who make decisions. And what decision do they make? Which route to take so the pizza wouldn't get cold. You got a problem with me and my friends hanging out here? No. Just chill. But if you ever deliver pizza to my place, don't expect any tips from me. This is an inside joke. You outsiders don't need to hear it. Dude, know why you can't hear any crickets sound tonight? Cause they're all waiting to see you getting your ass kicked. Devil's Blow!! Hi cuties. / Hi...! Miss? Miss? Hello Don't be shocked, you're at my place My name is Jojo. / Why did you take me here? Where are my friends? They ran off. The one who ran off first, was your friend with the big mouth. That's my boyfriend. Or my ex to be precise. Well, tonight ain't his lucky night. He took a bad beating and got dumped by his girlfriend. Now I'll give you 2 choices. You can spend the night here, or I can call you a taxi. And I'll escort you home. Taxi. / Sure you want me to call a cab? You sure? Don't want to sleep here? Okay. You're sure? You're really sure? Really? Yes, I'd like to order a cab. To... Wait a sec. Sorry, cancel that. Thanks. What are you doing guys? Who cooked? Thanks for taking care of me last night. PS. I only know how to make fried rice. What's wrong with you? You think you'll see her again? I don't know You've got her number though, right? Nope. What's her name? But she's got your number? / Not really. Damn. What's this? / That's the Lo Han fish I bought. There's still many in my bathroom. Funny, they don't look like Lo Hans now that they've grown. Why don't you ask the pet shop? / They've closed down What? / Yeah, I went there yesterday. They've closed down. / Congratulations, you've been scammed. There are many kinds of Lo Hans. Maybe these ones are just a different type. Smart-ass! I'm off. Turn on the stove, dude. / The stove, indeed. Thanks, boss. Meximena Presents: "The Attack of the Piranhas" I think we know what your fishes really are. What? No way man. They're Lo Hans, you smart-ass. Seriously. Trust me. They are Lo... No man! It hurts like hell! Don't be a pussy. Marley, I better cover it, the poor fish is shy. Smells bad too. / It hurts, damn you! What's with you guys now? / Please, it hurts. How come she's also here, dude? We tried to pull it, but it wouldn't let go. But this is not a hospital. This is a skincare specialist clinic! But this is an emergency. / Ok then... Where did he get bit? The thing between his legs. The skin? / Half of it. How is that possible? How big is the fish's mouth? It's not about how big the fish's mouth... ...but how small the bait is. Your penis is getting smaller. / No! I was in the tub. It shrank... You know!! What have we here, nurse? / A fish biting a worm, doctor. It hurts, doc. / Let's anaesthetize the fish. The fish is still moving. / Let's use this. Don't. / How about this? No way, Doc. / Good idea, thank you. Are you crazy? It's dangerous! I think the fish took a chunk of your foreskin. Let's just circumcise it while we're at it. No, don't do that. It hurts, moron! How's that? Don't be stupid again, okay. Don't worry be happy, dude. / Don't happy be worry, dude. Maybe the circumcision would make it bigger. Shut up! Do you work here? / No, I'm just an intern here. What are you doing here? Is somebody sick? It's a long story. / Good luck, dude. Thanks for taking care of me yesterday. Your welcome. Your place is really cozy. / It's actually my brother's. I could never afford a place like that... ...on my pizza delivery salary. We haven't officially met, actually. Lila. / Oh yes, Lila. Jojo. Call me sometimes. / I promise. Even the fish is crazy in love with Marley. Of course, shrunken worm. Stop! What are you up to? Nothing. Just getting changed. Don't put on your uniforms. From now on, you guys are in the advanced level. Exclusive level. Big clients. The uniforms won't be needed anymore. From now on you're doing wives of government officials... ... tycoons, and socialyties. Now, you are no longer ordinary gigolos... ... you are now money-making machines. Madam Mona? From all the women here... ...how did you know that I'm Madam Mona? Just lucky, I guess. Let's try your luck. You're always staring at me, why? You're just so beautiful. You could get any man you want. You don't need to call for a gigolo. Have you ever heard of a country in Africa called Otobugu? You know what? In Otobugu, a gigolo is a very respected occupation. Not just any man can be a gigolo. So you should be proud of what you do. Do you play? / Just a bit. A little bit? You're the best baby. Do you realize we haven't had dinner? How about dinner with me? Can I take a rain check? I have to get back to Quickie Express What's your phone number? We're not supposed to give out our personal numbers. Fine, I'll ask Mudakir. What did you do to Madam Mona? She wants you exclusively. / Exclusive? Yeah, but it's all good. She's willing to pay the price. Excuse me. What is this place? / It's my favorite spot. The line's really long. Sir, please step aside. / Thank you. Cool? Have you ever been up there? / Me? No! I just love to watch. / I bet you're good. No, I dance like a duck. Okay, let's hear it. Give it up for the Afro! And now... Give it up for the Sexy Lips! So Sexy lips is tonight's dancing queen. Now we need two guys to rock the stage. I'm gonna get drink. What would you like? Anything. You've got some nerve coming here. Teddy, don't start! What are you talking about? Why don't you settle your fight up here? I'm game. / I'm game too. He's been a champion here for years. Right now, it's not my honor on the line, It's yours. And I will do anything to fight for your honor. Give it up for Handsome and Macho. Who's Handsome and who's Macho? Stupid! I'm Handsome and Macho. They're all cheering for me. Okay, let's start this. Music, DJ! Come on, Jojo! Alright. Now how many of you like Handsome over here? And how many of you love Macho? Jo, that was so great. Where do you usually hang out? Nowhere, but if I go, maybe not to that kind of place. It's rather obvious from the way you dance. Do you have a girlfriend? / I wouldn't be here with you if I do. Who knows? When it comes to relationships, I prefer to be monogamous. Me too. Do you have a boyfriend before that beaten up guy? I did. But he wanted too much. So I dumped him. I'm an old-fashioned kind of girl. No sex before marriage. So, what else are you good at? Anything except math. What about you? / I like to sew. I make a lot of my own clothes. Why would you make them if you can just buy? Making your own is more fun. Design the model, choose the material... ...and it's more economical too. Right, Jo? Do you want any fruit? I just saw a dolphin. They say only very happy people can see dolphins. Is it that obvious? You haven't stopped smiling. What's going on? I'm in love. You don't have to say that just to make me happy. I don't mean with you. I know. I was just joking. What are you doing? Are you free tomorrow? / Why? Tomorrow's my birthday. I'd like you to come over and have dinner with my family. At my house. I'll be there. Really? I'll see you tomorrow. Your girlfriend? Another Madam? / No, we're the same age. What's her name? It doesn't matter. What matter is, I'm with you now. Another scandal just happened... ... where Jan Pieter Gunarto, the notorious tycoon... ... was freed from the charge of first degree murder. Listen, It's not my fingerpint and the DNA test doesn't match. The forensic evidence proves that. Do you feel like you're being trapped? He is the real criminal. I know they wanted to put me In jail... But they can't. That's Lila! Pause. You can't pause. This is TV. What? You saw that? / No. What's with you? Where are you going? / Dinner with Lila's family. It's her birthday. What's up? Jo, have a seat I just found out. / Just found out what? Do you know who your girlfriend's father is? Who? / Jan Pieter Gunarto. He owns all the thugs in Jakarta, man! Big time gangster. So what's the problem? / Are you stupid? He's a gangster. Criminal. That's okay, as long as I don't piss him off, right? Did you ever hear about his court cases? Murder. Corruption. Theft. Robbery. And why should I be worried? / Are you an idiot? First of all, he's never gonna let his daughter... ...date a pizza delivery boy. Second. If he ever finds out you're a gigolo... ...and still dates his daughter, You're dead man. I'm not scared. Don't go there, dude. / Don't mess your live, Jo. Where the hell is he going? / Moron! What beautiful flowers. / Your beautiful too. Come in. Cool... What's going on boys? / Come on boys, to the dinner room. Stop it boys. Let's be friends. Let's be friends. Those are my twin brothers, Dilly and Dillo. So naughty. Yup, like buzzing bees. / I'll put the flowers in a vase. Come in. Come on, Jo. Daddy, this is my friend, Jojo. And this is Dad's right-hand man, Matheo. I'm going. / Take care. Sit next to me, Jo. That's my mom's chair. Mom... Do you need any help? / No, it's rea...(dy). I'm just done cooking. Mom, this is Jojo. Jojo, this is my mom. Beautiful, isn't she? / Hello madam. Are you dating with my daughter? / Jojo and me are just friends, daddy. What do you do? / I deliver pizza. What? / Delivering pizza. My daughter is a doctor and you are a pizza boy? Jojo said he's going to be promoted to manager soon. You said that if we want to succeed, we must start from the bottom, right? Dad, Dillo got in a fight yesterday and he lost. You suck! Is that right? / But he was bigger than me. Is that right? If he's bigger than you, find a big stick. Beat him in the head. If you still lose, you hit him with a rock, from behind. If that still doesn't work, call daddy. Let me teach that kid a lesson. Cause my sons can't ever lose. Jojo is a very good dancer, you know. Right? Really? / That's right, mom. You like to dance too, right dad? Do you want salad? Good dancer? Do you play any musical instruments? A little bit. Piano? / A little bit. Only a little bit? / A little bit. Delicious. / Let's eat. Your family is outside. / I don't care. I'm not working tonight. / I can have you whenever I please. You think I'm going to let my daughter date a gigolo? I can quit. / No, you can't. That's impossible. Just a second. / Are you alright? Yeah, just a minute. Meet me tonight at the usual hotel. / No, I have a date with Lila. Why not meet her right now? What took you so long? / I've got a stomach ache. Where are you going? / I want to pee. Don't pee here. / Why? Smells so bad. Jojo, I'm working at hospital, so I'm used to that. What's with you? Wait. Is it the... Don't say that the toilet is clogged again? Yes, the toilet can't be flushed. / Not again, I told Ochay to fix it. Yes, go tell Ochay. Meet me tomorrow, or I'll spill the beans. Alright, but promise not to tell Lila. It all depends on you. Take care, Jo. Hello -Hello.... Jo I've been walting for a long time. / I want to get some rest today. I called Mudakir and he's told you to see me. But I'm not feeling well. / Do you want me to tell Lila? Hold on. Sorry my family wasn't very friendly last night. It's okay. / We're still meeting up today, right? Hold on. I can't see you tonight, what about tomorrow night? No. I want you here right away. One sec. Lila, what if we meet tomorrow instead? You can't make it? I'm so sad. Don't be. You're making me sad too. Just one second, okay? Madam, I really can't today. / Why are you calling me madam? Sorry, my aunt wants me to help her to paint her house. Just a second. Hello madam. / What's your excuse now? Madam, I'm really in love with Lila. / A guy like you don't understand love. All you care about is money! / Hold on. Lila, don't hang up, okay? Maam, I promise to satisfy you, just don't leak this out. Satisfy? What do you mean? My aunt, she's so demanding. The paint has to be perfect and everything. Just a second, don't hang up. Madam, you won't have the heart to hurt your own daughter! We'll see. Or should I just tell my husband? You know what he'll do to you? He will hunt you down until you're dead! How? We'll get away from here. We'll go abroad. I've enough money for us to live for years. Please Jo, I'm so in love with you. / I'm in love with Lila. You're just interested in her youth. But I'm the only one that can satisfy you. You'll never understand. / I understand that you are a gigolo. I'm quitting. / You can quit and get away with me. Madam! I'm getting out of here. And if you have a little sense of motherhood left in you. You're going to let me go. You take one more step and you'll get the consequences! Watch me. You'll regret this for the rest of your life! Sit! No. Here! How old are you? Twenty-seven, sir. Are you happy with your life? Is this the result of your work? I'm just trying to survive. You remind me of someone. He always underestimated himself. If only he realized what he was capable of with his talents... ...he could've been someone great. Take it. Take. His name was Bram. But now he's dead. Do you know why he died? / No, sir. He was careless, just like you. We used to be really close. We went through a lot together. We even started a business together. But he wanted to take a short cut and it cost him his life. Cops shoot him. I thought of him. See. Your face, you look just like him. You look just like Bram. I really miss him. I'll give you anything you want, anything... ...lf you'd take Bram's place. Sorry, sir... I can't. What are you doing here so early? / There's something I need to tell you. Can't it wait? / No, we have to talk now. If I wait, I dont know if I'll ever be able to say it. What's going on? But I love you. What's troubling you? I hate it when you get this way. Come on, tell me. What's bothering you, darling? Why? / Last night. Last night, I went out... But please, trust me. Please... I'll kill that guy! You've always been a coward. Without me, you don't even have the guts to breathe. Matheo...... I know you love me. But you can't go on killing everyone who hurts me. I want to kill Jojo, not because he has hurt you... ...but because you love him more than you love me. He reminds me of Bram. / Bram! Bram is dead! You know what? The cops didn't kill Bram! I killed him. It was me! Don't you start crying! Putting on that sad face. Don't be a wuss! You look like a fag. You're dating Madam Mona's daughter? Jan Pieter Gunarto's daughter? Why? You can't help who you fall in love with. It just happened. What are you gonna do now? / I'm gonna stop being a gigolo. Maybe that way Lila will take me back. You can't quit. What are you going to do for money? Whatever. Maybe I'll fix tires again. Such a waste of your balls. Where is Jojo? Where is Jojo? Think about it. You could at least work for me for two more years. By then you'll have enough money to live with that Lila girl of yours. No way! I want to quit. What the hell is this place? Where is Jojo? Motherfucker! You're just in an emotional rut. There has got to be a better way out of this. Nothing is better than quitting! Where is Jojo! Bastard! / Dear God! Where is Jojo? I'm gonna ask one more time. Where is Jojo? Devil's Blow! THE PERFECT JOB FOR YOU IS: MODEL I want to kill Jojo. I want to help my friends! Come with me! Hurry up Jo! Just follow the tunnel. You can get out from here. Where is Jojo? Who are you? You look like a fag. You motherfucker! Faggot! Oh my God. It's so hot here. I can't stand it anymore. Shut up! Asshole! I'm tired already! Your dead! Help Jojo! Now you die! No way to run. I'll cut off your balls! Damn! Don't grab my ass. Now your die. Motherfucker! Hey, motherfucker! Jan Pieter is my man! You bastard! Hey man, you can have Jan Pieter. I'm not interested. You've taken his heart. Who do you think you are? You're a loser! How does it feel knowing that you are about to die as a loser? I wish I could die sooner! / Why don't you be patient. I want to pray for you first. So that you will be a winner... ...in hell you scumbag! Sorry buddy, we're too slow. I have no Idea what to do now. I'm not talking about the dead Matheo. We could just say It was an accident. Besides, who's going to believe me If I tell the truth? A sugar mama with a gay husband... ... who falls In love with his daughter's boyfriend... ... who then kills his gay lover after tossing around on a trampoline? I have to choose the right path of Iife. A path with dignlty. Something I can be proud of and something of value to society. You only Ilve once. What else have you got except your pride as a human being? As a man? Fuck It ! Okay, now everything has changed. My best friends try to pursue their dreams. Piktor, he never quits. Marley, he's never shy. The best job that I'll ever had? Thank you very much man. But I think this enough for me. Hey dude, that sounds interesting. What's the job? Me? I'll just be realistic. HUNTER
