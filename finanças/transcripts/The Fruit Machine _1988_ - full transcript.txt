[inaudible] And I'm not going back there- not for him, not for the police, and not for you. I told you I'd look after you, haven't I? Listen, I got you away from him, didn't I? Well, what are we gonna do, then? Michael. Michael, wait for me. Michael. Michael, wait. Please. Please. Please. Blow. It's "Rigaletto." What? It's "Rigaletto," the opera. No, it's not.

Just thinking about the past and the future. - It's a lot of money, Vincent.- Yes, it is. But what price would you puton your soul, Eve, assuming, of course, that you have one? Well, it's too late for second thoughts now. You signed the contract. Oh, correction. I have agreed to sign the contract. That's quite a different thing. I've had the good fortuneto come to nearly all of his performance. He's quite a remarkable artist. Let's do one. We don't fit in here. I can tell they hate us. I can feel them all staring at us.

You don't sound Italian. I was born in Bath. It's funny. You don't look anything likeyour photograph on the cover. You look a lot older. Oh, I'm sorry. No, that's OK. Anyway, I'm a lot older. But, you see, they insiston using younger photographs and touching them up to makethe housewives drool, I suppose. Does it? Why else would they buy my records? You're the greatest singer we've ever had. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You will swell my head, young man. Did you like the singing?It's from an opera called-- "Rigoletto." I've always enjoyed the way you sing it. My ma's got all your records.She-- You seem to know an awful lot about me, and I know nothing about you. What's your name? Eddie. Eddie what? Eddie. Just Eddie. Did you know Maria Callas? Yes, I did. Got a photo of her here, in my bag. She used to be my mom's best mate. That's why I know so much about opera. And look, she even signed it. "To Jean," that's my mom, "love, Maria." She's not like that now, though. She's still lovely, of course. Always will be. But she's-- she's a little fat now. She said, it was having methat wrecked her figure. Women are as roses, alas,that they are so, dying even as they, to perfection, grow. What are you and your friend doing here? Can I trust you? Ah, well-- OK. We've run away from home. Well, I have. Michael's on the run. I'm sorry? He's doing it from DC. Ah, da capo? No, detention center. And what was he doingthere in the first place? His step-mother put him there. For being different. We're both different. That's why I've run away as well. So now you're off into theworld, looking for adventure. Yeah. I suppose we are. How old are you? We're both 16. And a half. I don't know why I'm telling you all this. We don't even know each other. Well, I know you because you're famous. But I could be anyone. I'm sure you couldn't be just anyone. You only meet a better classof person in the Adelphi Hotel. The Adelphi. It's a nice name, isn't it? [inaudible]. I think it's the Greek for dolphin. Yes, the dolphin hotel. Oh, that's amazing. Because look. [chuckling] Empty your pockets. I won't. You do understand English.

It will be much simpler if youemptied all your pockets now before you're forced to. I've emptied all my pockets. I've put everything back. So it looks like you're goingto make a tiss out of yourself. And anyway, what's to stopme taking the key off you? A room full of people next door. Who are you anyway, Jennifer Justice? I've done nothing. It was only money. Was it your money, your possessions? You's are all loaded. You wouldn't miss a bit of it. Look. Look, I even put a tennerin here, because there was nothing in it. Oh, well done. What a performance. And who are we now, Robin Hood? I'm only 16. They'll stick me awayforever if you blow me up. You should have thought of that before. But what do you's expect? Flaunting your money and your wealth. And most of us can't even affordto buy a packet of ciggies. We have to rob to survive. Spare me the working class rhetoric. You're a tedious, insignificant thief. Nothing more. [knocking] And you deserve all thatyou have bought on yourself. Just give me one more chance. That's all, one. I'll never do it again, ever. Tell him it was a mistake, a jok. Why should I? MAN: Miss Carr, are you in there? It's the hotel security. Are you all right, love? I'll make it up to you. And how would you do that? I don't know. I don't know. Please, don't tell him. I'll do anything you want. It must be great to have a gift like yours, to be an artist. I don't do it for art anymore. I do it for money. I'm going to Brighton to shootthree commercials advertising cut price cassettes. Commercials? Mm-hmm. God, it must be a great life-- making adverts and going down to Brighton. Then why don't you come with me? I've got a car outside,waiting to take me to Brighton. I have to shoot the first commercial tomorrow. Do you mean it? Of course. I'll go and tell Michael. You're not joking, are you? Go and tell your friend we're leaving before I change my mind. So you see, I've made rather a fool of myself. It seems I've been the victim of a hoax. Do accept my apologies. That's OK, love. So long as you're sure everything's all right. Absolutely positive. You come and have a drink. What's going on? You haven't done anything, have you? Of course I haven't. Are you sure? Get off me back, will you? You're like an old woman. Michael, I've got a surprise. How do you fancy going downto Brighton, by the sea? Michael, are you listening to me? We're going down to Brighton. I know we are. God, I wish my mom was here. She wouldn't believe it-- meand you going down to Brighton with Vincent Barbielli. And I've done it. Just think. You should believe people, you know. What do you mean? You shouldn't believe people. That's all. We don't have to go if you don't want to. I don't mind really. As long as we're together, that's all. [honking] VINCENT: Come on, boys? What's that? Is is a car? No. It's an orgasm. Come on. What make is it? It's rich, that's the make. Oh, shit. [SINGING] Running wild, lost control. Running wild, mighty bold. Feeling gay, reckless too. Don't, Ed. They're looking at us. - So what? It's my favorite song. Carefree minds all the time. Never blue, ooh! Oh, it's Marilyn Monroe. It's who I feel like. Is this a Rolls-Royce? No, it's a Bentley. I always think that Rolls-Roycesare a bit pretentious, don't you? Yeah, always. JEAN: He's gone, Billy. BILLY: What do you mean, he's gone? JEAN: His clothes are gone as well. He's took his dolphin. He's gone, Billy. He's left home because of you, persecuting him morning, noon, and night. Come on, girl. You know I didn't mean it. Oh, didn't you? Oh, well it's too late totell him that now, isn't it? No, he won't. I hope you're satisfied. You've hounded that lad. I wanted him to be a man, to be tough. By calling him every queer under the sun? They're giving them a disease now. It's not just a stigma anymore. It's a disease, and it's fucking killing them. You're wrecked his headmore than anyone, you have. I don't slap him around the face. I love him. Oh, yeah. Bette Davis, Marilyn Monroe, Joan Crawford. He's a young lad, for fuck's sake. He doesn't want to listen to you, sitting there like some aging actress, trying to live your life through him. And what type of life or alternative have you ever offered him, eh? Of how you're goingfor the part in "Saturday Night and Sunday Morning." You're just jealousbecause I got offered a part, the part of the bar maid. I could have been famous. I could. You know John Schlesingerwas never in Liverpool. He was. He was! You know he never offered you a part. He did. You wasn't there. It was before I met you. And do you want to know how I know, eh? Because John Schlesinger never directed "Saturday Night and Sunday Morning." It was directed by a woman, Carol Rice. Well, it was a long time ago. I must have got the names mixed up. The only thing you got mixedup with our Eddie's mind. And you knew exactly what you were doing. Don't, Billy. Don't spoil the only dream I've ever had. Wake up, will you? You're not in a movie. You're here with me in friggin' Kirby. Our Eddie believes me. He'll always believe me. That's why he took the photograph. Oh, nay. You never met Maria Callas either. I'm not listening to you. You're trying to distort everything. You clipped that photo out of a magazine and took it to a shop ina town with a photo of you and had them cut together. It was you that signed thefront, "To Jean, love, Maria." Fucking pathetic woman. And you've got the cheekto wonder why I'd kick off. Well, I'm glad he's gone. REPORTER [ON TV]: --a male transvestite and manager of the well-knownhomosexual [inaudible].. It's not true. Don't say that. Because I know why he really left, and it wasn't to get away from me.

[soothing music] [yelping] Thank you for the bed. I think we've ironed out our little difference with the contract now, don't you? I'll see you at the studio. Oh, by the way, regarding ourlittle deal, I've taken my 10%. Is Eve your girlfriend? Um, no. She owns an advertising companyI'm to do some commercials for. But really I think she's a frustrated actress. Soundsa bit like my mom. I can't believe I'm here. I never met a star before. I've smelt a star, though. You've what? I've smelt a star. It was years ago. I must have been about five or six. I was at my gran's, and my Auntie Muriel came home from aDusty Springfield concert at the Empire. She ran to the house with thisdead expensive-looking handbag, a big red leather one witha silver clasp on top. Dusty Springfield had onlythrown it into the audience, and my auntie caught it. There was murder. People tried to snatch it off her. But she just held onto it. I remember picking it up once, opening it, and smalling inside. It smelled of mink and perfume. Not the cheap strong stuff, mind, but expensive, elegant stuff. It smelled of Dusty Springfield. That's the nearest I'veever got, till I met you. Dusty Springfield. I'm flattered to be in such good company. I came here once to Brighton with my mom. I was only a kid. She took me to the dolphinsin the dolphinarium. You must mean Wonderland. It's still here. They're probably stillusing the same creatures. Why don't you go there? To Wonderland? Why, it's only fiveminutes' walk along the beach, and you might see some of your old friends. - I'll go and wake Michael up.- No, no. Don't do that. The poor boy must be absolutely exhausted. No, you run along. I'll wake him with somebreakfast before I leave. Here. You don't have to do that, you know. You may need it. It is very expensive. But-- [inaudible]. I insist. Now, let's see. Hm? I think that one's the nicest. Looks like the one Montgomery Clift wore in "Suddenly Last Summer." Say, thanks for the money, Vincent. Oh, it's nothing. GIRL: Take one of these, please. Would you take one of these, please? You must stop dolphins from being [inaudible].. Would you read this, please? Thank you. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Take one of these before you go in, and read it very carefully,please, will you? [music playing] [cheering] Don't be so impatient, Sooty. Beverly. Beverly! Oh, shut up. And now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to ask Sooty to perform a trick for you which has never been doneby dolphins in the wild or in captivity. And in a moment, you'll see why. [drumroll] [cheering] I thought this was for the kids. Thank you. Thank you. And we mustn't forget thedolphins, especially Sooty. [cheering] And now, before the end of the show, I'd be delighted to answer any questions from the boys and girls. Well, is there anybody outthere that would like to ask a question about the dolphins? Ah, yes. Little girl at the back. What would you like to know. Is Sooty a boy or a girl? And how old is he? Well, as all the menin the audience observed, Sooty is most definitely a man. I can assure you of that. And he's the grand old age of 23. Now, is there anybody else? Ah, yes. The young gentleman. Do you think it's cruel to treat him like that? He shouldn't be here. Throwing dead fish in the wild, you know. And how long do you expect him to live in that tiny little pool? Well, actually, if youknew anything about dolphins in captivity, you would know that they live to a considerable age. This isn't Wonderland. It's hell. It shouldn't be here. It's sick and degrading. Look at it. Just look at it. How would you like to be trappedin that tiny little poof for the rest of your stupid life? Well? Why don't you answer me? Pulling your bra off. You just want to show your tits, don't you? [groaning]- Hey, leave the girl alone. So that's your problem. It's called entertainment,if you didn't already know. No, it's not. It's exploiting animals. That's what it is. Here, come with me. Right protestors. You lot just don't learn. I'm just trying to say that it's cruel. And I'm not an animal rights protestor. And it is cruel. WOMAN: Go on to mommy. What'd you come in here for? [interposing voices] Come on, let's go. Do you want a swig? Oh, go on. I hate drinking alone. What is it? Nectar that puts hair on your chest. Ew. Cheers. Mm. Did it do your head in in there? Why do they do it to them? It's crazy. I don't understand. Because they're money-grubbing bastards. That's why. Do you know they'd throwtheir own granny in there and make her jump throughhoops if they thought they could make a few bob out of it? We've been down here for months now. We sneaked in there one night,smashed a window, got in. Well, we had all had a few-- I mean, not pissed just-- well, a bit [inaudible],, you know. Anyway, in we get. I tore the knickers offmyself on the broken glass. What happened? Well, we decided we were going to try and get them out and free them. But they wouldn't come near us. I don't blame them. Anyway, so I dived in with them. Weren't you scared? Aye. I shit myself. Sooty is a fucking randy bastard. He kept swimming in between mylegs and rubbing up against me. I felt dead sorry for him. I had half a mind togive him a sympathy wank. He's going to die in there. They always do. Oh, don't say that. Oh, they don't ever survive. But they said Sooty was already 23. That's a lie. Well, I mean, they're hardly going to tell the kids that it'son its last legs, are they? What happens when they die? Well, they just buy anotherone, give it the same name, and no one's the wiser. I want to go backthere, rip the place apart with my bare hands, bring himdown here, and put Sooty back in the sea, where he belongs. Sooty. Sooty. I mean, what a fucking name, eh? Do you know, they give themthese pathetic little names so they seem significant. That way they're as indispensable as an old worn-out Durex. I feel like that sometimes. What, like an old worn-out Durex? No. Like I've got to be something I'm not. I've never told anyone this before, but I'm-- well-- Oh, come on. I mean, what does it matter? But I sort of feel like that dolphin. Jump for the nice people, Sooty. Speak in a girly sissy voice, Sooty. Yeah, but you're not trappedin a dolphinarium, are you? Aren't I? Anyway, I always thought people like you-- animal rights protestors, I mean-- always wore wooly hats. Ah. No peeking. [chuckling] Hey, do you fancy a swim? Oh, it looks too cold. I'd freeze the balls off myself in there. And anyway, I haven't got my swim cozzy. Oh, who needs one of them? What's wrong? Haven't you ever seen a fanny before? Fanny? Looks more like a pound of chopped liver to me. Oh! [screaming] See ya! Hey, so what's your name? Sooty. My name's Sooty. See ya, Sooty! [carnival music] [intense music] [thunder] [muffled voices] EDDIE: Michael, are you in there? You are in there. I can here you. No, he's not in there. EDDIE: But he's in there. I can hear him. I am not a liar. He's not here. [inaudible] He was going for a walk along the front. You are in there. I know you are. Short of letting yousearch the bedroom, there's very little I can say to satisfy you. Would you care to search under the bed? I thought he was in there with you. I sleep alone. Always. You and Michael are here as my guests. I require nothing from you. I'm sorry. I just thought-- I know. Is he gone? Yes. What a strange littlerelationship you two have. He's my best mate. He cares about me. He's just a bit sensitive, that's all. He's also a little bit-- what's the word I'm looking for-- simple. Don't you laugh at him. I wouldn't have done any ofthis if it hadn't been for him. He needs looking after,someone to take care of him. Then why don't you let me take care of him? You? Don't you ever go near him. You go near him-- Come back to bed. No. Why not? Because I don't like the way you laugh about Eddie behind his back. And I don't want to, OK? Then, what exactly do you want? Do you want the truth, do you? I don't want you. But last night and yesterday morning, you seemed to want me then. Do you think I wanted to? Do you really believe that? I'd done it for me andEddie, for somewhere to stay. You don't think I could fancy a dried up old queen like you, do you? You might have conned him with your posh talk of operas and arty-farty people,but it means fuck all to me. You didn't bring it down herebecause darling would think you're both absolutely divine. You brought us down here because you wanted to get inside my undies. Well, I can't count the timesI've met people like you before. You're a vampire. That's what you are, a vampire. And it's not blood that you suck. It's-- - I don't deserve this. What right have you to speak to me like that? I've done nothing to you. Don't make me laugh. The first time I done itwas for pay and for a lift and somewhere to stay. And now I want money for last night. And what makes you think I'd give you any? Oh, you'll give me itall right, because if you don't, I'll make you pay. One way or the other. And you'll pay dearly. Oh, bravo, bravo. OK, speech over. Now, get your things together and leave. I'm not going anywhere until you've coughed up. I want money. You stupid little rent boy. Do you think I haven't come across grasping benders like you before? You've been idiotic over all of this. I liked you. I liked you a lot. You could have done very well out of me, if only you'd used your head. And you mean used me ass. Don't you understand, Miss Mozart? I can't bear the fucking sight of you. It's you smelling delicateand fucking sickly. I want money, and I want it now. You leave me no option but to call the police. Go on, then. Call them. But isn't it against the law to do what you done to a 16-year-old lad? So yeah, you fucking call them, and I'll tell them everything and more. They'd never believe you. It would be your word against mine. Doesn't matter whether they believe me or not. It wouldn't look very nicefor you, though, would it? Especially if thenewspapers got hold of me. Get out! Aging opera star in gay shame. Do you think that would makea good headline, Vincent? Now give me the money. Not a hope in hell. Well, I'm not going anywhereuntil you give me money. [music playing] MICHAEL: I thought I'd find you here. I'm not going back there, Ed. To Vincent's. Why not? Because he's been trying to sleep with me. Said I owed it to him. And if I didn't, he'd kick us both out, then phone the police. Tell them I was on the run. He did. I didn't think he was like that. Neither did I. So you know what I done? I told him to shove his ought up his hole. And then I left. So it looks like we're on our own again, Ed. Just me and you. I don't mind. I like you. Being with you, I mean. Besides me ma, you're the only person who-- Shut up. We're like Bonnie and Clyde, aren't we? Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis. No, we're just like JaneRussell and Marilyn Monroe. Just a pair of little queer[inaudible],, aren't we? No, we're not. We're lads. We're young men. Where'd you get that from? Off Vincent. You didn't rob it, did you? He gave it to me. I'm not going back there, Ed. But I'll have to. All my stuff's there. Why can't you leave it? I can't leave Brighton. Why not? You know why. The fish? It's not a fish. It's a creature. And I want to set it free. Vincent? Are you up there? There you are. I've been looking all over the house for you. Why are you sitting in herewith the curtains drawn? Who done that to you? No. It wasn't-- he wouldn't do it to you. No. [door closing] Michael! Michael! What are you doing? Why did you do it? Why did you do it? [inaudible]. You slept with him andsmashed his face in because he wouldn't give you any money. Why did you do it? I didn't do anything. Liar. You liar! I didn't touch him, Ed. I didn't have to. Look. I took this. I took it for us. I took it for you. Why does everything haveto end in violence with you? Is it the only language you understand? I didn't touch him, Ed. I didn't have to. He gave me the money. Isn't that why we left Liverpool, eh? To get away from people who want to hurt us? I didn't touch him, Ed. Then who did, eh? Who did? I wouldn't hurt anyone. It's all an act. Eddie! [music playing] Sooty. Sooty, where are you? [dolphin noises] There you are. They tried to keep me away from you. But I had to come and see you. I'm like you, you see. Trapped. I'm gonna come in with you. I know you won't mind. [dolphin noises] [music playing] [gasping] What's wrong, Sooty? [dolphin noises] What's wrong, eh? Come on, mister. I didn't do anything. It wasn't me who told the police. Honest. Oh, please. Oh, not like this. I'm only 16. Why? Eddie! Eddie! Hey! Eddie! Eddie! [gasping] [shouting] [yelping] Ed! You're all right! What's he done to you? I'm all right, Michael. All right. Is he dead? I don't know. I don't know. Come on. We've got to get out of here now. [woman screaming] [gulls squawking] I think you need-- you need help, mate. A doctor. No. But he's hurt you. I've got to go for help. I'm all right, Mike. Don't go. They'll catch you. It doesn't matter. There's nothing to be frightened of. They can't catch us. No one can. Don't go. Please. I'll come straight back. I promise. Don't go! MAN: Get it right down to the front, yeah? Where are you taking it? But it's dying. Can't you see that? Oh, come on. Why don't you do somethingwith your life for once and put it into the sea where it belongs? Look, it's only there! Look, if you mustknow, that dolphin killed someone in a pool last night. Oh, rubbish. Where are you taking it? Windsor Sea World, as far as I know. Now, move back. What, are you heartless or what? [inaudible]. Look, there are people starving [inaudible].. Now, why don't you go and set them free? It's only a fish. You [inaudible]. It's not a fish. It's a creature. Yeah. Will you help me? Yeah, if I can. Can you drive? Where to? Special, this dolphin, isn't it? They're all special. Have you ever set an animal free? No. I'll do it because-- because I owe it to someone. Right, let's go. Hey, I'll distract the driver. The keys are in the ignition. OK, go for it. I'm not letting you take it to Windsor Sea World or anywhere else. You can go and fuck yourself. MAN: Get away from there. What's wrong with you? You off your head, or what? No! Get away from there! Drive it to the sea! Drive it to the sea! Yes! [music playing] [sirens] I think you better goand get him out of there. Why don't you? If you had been doing your job properly, there'd be no need to get anyone out. For Christ's sake, get him out of there. He's only a kid. Animal right sprotestors. They're a pain in the bloody ass. Help! Wait! Wait for me! Ed. You said you were all right. I set it free for you, Ed. I set it free for you. For me? Because I love you. Scalliwag. I done it for you, Ed. You're my best mate. Don't leave me now. Don't be sly. We've only just begun our adventures. No one can catch us, not me and you. Oh, hold on, Ed. Hold on. [inaudible]. Shall I sing you your favorite song, Marilyn Monroe's "Running Wild"? [SINGING] Running wild, lost control. Running wild, mighty bold. Feeling gay. Restless too. [sobbing] It's just not fair. It's not fair! No one can hurt him anymore. He's safe. He's safe. He's out there in the sea. He's safe. Swim. Swim. Swim! [music playing]
