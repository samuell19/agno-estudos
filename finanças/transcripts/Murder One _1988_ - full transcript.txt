Hey. Where have you been? You don't want to know. I get paid today, so I guess I'll bring home some supper. That'd be nice, Billy. I guess I'll see you later. BILLY: People always thought I'd turn out bad. They whisper behind my back about my brothers and turn their noses up at me 'cause I stayed with Carl's girl. I didn't care. Jenny always watched out for me, we did okay. We were survivors. MAN: Hey, Billy. I got some news for you. Your brothers escaped from prison last night. If you see them, tell them it's not worth it. Yeah, if I see them. Hey, Bob, don't you come around here leaning on my help, huh? No way, Ray, we're just having a little word of prayer. If I see you again, Billy, I'm going to be wearing my uniform. I might not be so nice. So you don't forget what I told you. BILLY: Nah, I won't forget. Are you in any trouble, Billy? Never been in any trouble. Aren't you gonna eat? Billy, don't be mad at me. [KNOCKING ON THE DOOR] Are you expecting someone? I don't know. Carl, what are you doing here, man? I busted out. Heading for home. I brought you a surprise. I sprung Wayne with me. You sprung Wayne? Where's he at? He's out in the alley. Aw, you're not lying, are you? Go on and check. Why'd you come here? To say hello. I didn't think you'd wait on me... but I didn't figure you'd be doing my little brother either. At least you're keeping it in the family. Hey. Hey, man, what you been up to? Living it up. How'd you escape? Out the bathroom window, big as life. Are you taking Billy? You should have waited on me. Hey, man, you guys need anything? Yeah, some clothes, flashlight, knife and get some money. Okay.And make it quick. We're in a hurry, know what I mean? Yeah, okay. Lay low. The law should be looking for us now. What the hell's wrong with you? Don't go with them. Who? Carl, who else? I'm not going with him. I'm just getting some things, I'm staying right here. Hey, look, we can sure enough party tonight. I'm going to Mom's house. You want to come? I don't know, me and Mom ain't been getting along. Don't worry, she won't mind. Well, can you bring me home? Sure, babe, any time you want. Let's go. [DOG BARKING] [BELL RINGING] Carl, please don't hang around too damn long. I don't want them coming up here again. EVA: Who's that, Mike? Your brothers. Hey, Eva. Every time you are in trouble and come here, the police come and give us a hard time. I just came by to say hi to Mom. And I come to get my single shot. No, you're not getting it. Well, I'll get it one way or the other. No, you won't. What do they want? His gun.Let him have it. It's his life, let him have it. Give it to me now or I'll get another gun, and come back and get it. Take it then. Hi, Mom. You're a bunch of fools. Damn if I'm gonna stay down there for four straight years and come out with nothing. Come here, Billy. You ought to get a job instead of hanging around with them. BILLY: I've already got a job, Mom. Then what are you doing with them? You wouldn't understand anyway. Oh, I don't care what you do. CARL: I came a long way to see you. I'm trying to get a new start. Go on, get out of here. [SIREN WAILING] Come on, man. She knew I was coming. I knew she'd call the cops on me. [SIREN WAILING] Get Wayne. Wayne, hurry up, police. You got one hell of a nerve, Wayne. Billy, you stay here. You coming? I'm coming. BILLY: I thought it in my head but I didn't say nothing. My legs were moving, but my words, they wouldn't come out. Somehow I knew that I was gonna end up going anyway. And they're my brothers, my real family. They're my only real family that I have left. Yeah, I'm coming. What the hell are you doing? Don't worry, they didn't see the car. That's Officer Pritchard, I've outrun him before. Those policemen gonna get themselves some crooks, some real bad crooks. Maybe we ought to drop you off for them policemen so they can give you a ride home. Hey, man, don't be saying that. Man, why's he saying that? He's just joking, George. WAYNE: My mouth feels like the bottom of a parrot's cage. We got to get some guns, Carl. Uncle John has a whole houseful. Well, let's go. I owe him a visit anyway. What for? The son of a bitch run me off the property 'cause I was drunk, and he sent me that letter while I was in prison. What did he say? Well, hell, I told you about that, don't you remember? He's sayin' I talked Uncle Mule into robbing that bar. He's four years older than me, he's got a mind of his own. Yeah, Jenny's probably wondering where I'm at. Forget Jenny. She's no good for you anyway. Yeah, we'll pay Uncle John a visit, all right. While he's at work. ♪ Crazy ♪ I'm crazy for feeling so lonely ♪ I'm crazy ♪ Crazy for feeling so blue ♪ I knew you'd love me ♪ As long as you wanted ♪ And then someday ♪ You'd leave me for somebody new ♪ Worry, why did do I let myself worry?

You know I can't swim none, but I ain't afraid of the water though. Bullcrap. I ain't afraid. I don't go near it and it don't go near me. George. What's wrong? I don't know.

Good afternoon. You know whose car this is? Yeah.Yeah? Whose is it? Nah, it ain't his, 'cause I know whose it is. And it sure as hell ain't yours. I don't want any trouble, so why don't you boys just get out of here right now. Oh, yeah, you're right. I don't know whose car that is, but I do know whose car that is. Yeah, mine. So? No, it's ours. Now don't fuck around. Where are your car keys, boy? They're in the car. Where are your car keys, boy? I don't know. They're in the car. Go on. Nope. You got about 2 seconds to find them car keys... boy. Billy? Yeah. Go on in the trunk, find some rags and then tie him up. You got any money? No. You got a wallet? Good boy. No money, huh? Any ID? Give it here, all I've got is prison. You're making a move for that pistol? I'll shoot you. I'll shoot you. What the fuck's he doing? Bending over in front of that man like that, Wayne? You shouldn't have done that. That was stupid. You go on and help Wayne, okay? Yeah, okay. Move over, George. What they gonna do? What do you think? I don't know. Lie down and put your hands behind your back. Let's go. BILLY: It's strange when a person gets killed all of a sudden. They're there, and then they're not there. It's like this crack opens up in the universe and they just fall out of it. Have a beer, boy, do you good. We're all tight now, right? Long as we stick together, we're free as a bird. That's right. Free as a bird what sitting in the tree singing for his supper. Free as a bird what sitting in the tree singing for his supper. Jesus H. Christ, now you've got him going again. We didn't have to kill him. Forget it, Billy. I don't want to hear that crap. Well, we could have just tied him up. What are you crying about? Now I was the one who pulled the trigger, right? Me. Look, Billy, I didn't like it any more than you did. It's just the way that it worked out. Well, there was no reason to kill him. The man went for my gun, Billy. That's the reason that he killed hisself. Just try to forget it, Billy. Too late to turn around and say, "I don't want any more." Try to forget it, okay? And let's try to have a little fun while we're at it. [SIREN WAILING] Oh, fuck. Mr. Patrolman's pulling up on us. Wake up, it's the police. Fuck. We get rid of the beers, Billy? Put the rifles underneath the seat in the back. How does my breath smell? [BREATHES OUT] You have a hint of cigarette. Yeah, give me that. Let's see.How about now? [BREATHES OUT] Smoky. Aw, shit, just keep cool, man. Here he comes. Fuck. Step out of the car, please. Did I do something wrong? How about walking to the back of the car for me, please? Did you pull me over to see me walk? I believe you're weaving a bit. How about walking for me? Yeah, sure, I'll walk for you. Okay, why don't you just go heel to toe? All right. Kind of wobbly there, aren't you? Not much, a little bit. How much have you been drinking? One beer with my dinner. Why don't you just follow my finger? All right. Let me see your driver's license. Here.Oh, no. Be cool. Okay, you can wait in the car. Jesus fucking Christ, man. So, what do you want to do? See what happens. If he finds anything out, ain't nothing he can do, I mean, it's four of us against one of him. I'm not gonna give you a ticket this time, but you better pull over somewhere. That drinking and driving don't mix. Yes, sir. Next motel. Okay. Don't let me catch you weaving no more. No, sir. All right. Good night. Good night. Fuck. Let's get the fuck out of here. Let's get out of here, man. Just take it cool till we get out of sight. All right. Well, he's gone. I got to pull over. I'm getting real tired. BILLY: There's never any mention of a plan, nothing like that. Seems to me that when you get free, the first thing you should do is figure where all the highways go. Carl and Wayne were just playing by ear and things just sort of escalated from there. Carl was driving, I was just a passenger. CARL: Move over, make some room, we're picking him up. WAYNE: What are we? A taxi cab? CARL: Look at him, worse off than us, nobody else is gonna stop and pick him up. Thanks for stopping. I've been waiting there a long time. Yeah, I'll bet you have. Where you guys heading? BILLY: South. Me too. You guys on vacation or something? No, just looking for some jobs. How about yourself? No, I'm just traveling, you know, trying to get my act together. You guys smoke? Yeah, sure. Some wine would be far out. What's the word? Thunderbird. What's the price? Fifty twice. You been traveling for a while? Yeah, quite a while. They call me Angel. Thanks, man. That's some good shit. You ain't got no booth? We don't have any right now. Would you like to wait? This will be fine. Thank you. Enjoy your dinner. Let's get something that's quick. There's no beer. No shit. Um, I'll have a bowl of chili with a coke and saltines, please and that will be fine. How about we all have that? Yeah. Will that be all? Mmm-hmm. Billy, where are you going? I'm just gonna go wash up. He's funny. Remember I called him up one time... and I said, "You got any cash?" He said, "No, I'm broke." I said, "How about Mom?" And he said, "She's broke, too." So I said, "Why don't you run upstairs, "you look in her lingerie drawer." He came running back down and said, "I found 600 bucks in her brassiere." 600. What a pile. Where'd she get it? She probably rolled some John for it. BILLY: I'm just doing all the motions. I don't feel nothing, I don't feel scared, I don't feel excited, I don't feel anything. I'm just numb. It's like I've been rolling down a hill on my side for hours and hours and finally I hit bottom. [GUNSHOT] [DIALING PHONE] JENNY: [ON PHONE] Hello? Hi. Billy, are you all right? Look, I'm really in bad trouble. The police have been here. They know you're with Carl and Wayne. Billy? I want to go back, but I don't know if they'd understand. Get the hell out of there. I don't know what they'd do to me if they caught me trying to leave. They're your brothers. Billy? Billy? Don't you ever make no phone call without checking with me first. I was only talking to Jenny. Hey... I caught Billy on the phone in there. What, in here? Who was he calling? He said Jenny. Oh, man, I don't like that. Billy gonna fuck us up? Or that guy in there. No, Angel's okay, man. He don't know nothing. Billy's the one we got to watch out for. Wayne, he ain't got it. Yeah. Well, I ain't pussy-footing around to suit that Angel. Look, we don't got to pull no heavy stuff 'cause we got enough to get there. Fine by me, but I'm still gonna have me some fun. CARL: Watch this. Oh, man, don't do that, you're gonna make him wreck! Come on, get back in here, Wayne! Whoa! Yeah! He must have thought a UFO got him or something. Huh, I feel a whole lot better. BILLY: For most people, the sea was just the sea, the sand was just sand. They weren't that way for me no more. Hi. Hi. Is it okay if I sit here? Sure. WAYNE: Look at all the goddamn sand. Not sorry you came, are you? Nah, that isn't it. You know, the dumb ass, he killed hisself. You still got that on your mind? Boy, Wayne, you're a lot of fun. To hell with the fun. Is this fun? Everybody looks at you like you're some kind of crook or something. Piss on them, I say. Yeah. Come on. Let's get a bite, huh? All right. All right. Boy, he's doing all right. It's too bad we can't say the same. Hey, Angel, open the trunk. You sure you don't want to come? I want to go on to Key West. You got any money? I don't need any money, Carl. Here, man, take this. Thanks a lot for letting me stay with you and all that. See you guys around sometime. Yeah, I'm glad to do you a favor, all right? See you later, man. Okay, Billy... George. Be seeing you, man. Wayne, thanks a lot, man. Yeah, think nothing of it. Check him out, man. He already got a ride. God damn it, that guy's lucky. Yeah, we're gonna need a lot more than luck to get out of this shithole. How much more have we got left? I don't know, about 10 bucks. Ten bucks and you give him money. We got enough for beer and gas, what do you care? Oh, hell, Carl... We got to rob some place. I could've gone to Ocean City and had fun and not have to drive a thousand miles to get there. WAYNE: I've had it with this damn riding. Hell, look at this place, it's flat as a pancake... and all these dumb people do is ride around in tractors and big old weird machines all day. What are we doing here, Carl? We're staying out of prison. Yeah, well, that's about all. Hell, at least in prison you get three squares a day and plenty of sleep. That's about your speed, Wayne. Where do you want to go? I don't know. Anywhere but here. We ain't going nowheres on empty and we don't get no gas until we get some cash. Oh, fuck me. I got to get reloaded. Let's pull over here. CARL: George, you stay with the car. You see anybody, come on in and get us. I can do that. That's all you have to do. Why don't Billy stay with me? 'Cause Billy's got to come in and learn how to do this shit. Why don't I never get to go in? Because you're too damn slow, now just shut up, George. [BELL RINGS] Can I help you? A pack of Marlboros... and a box of milk duds. What are you doing? Hang on. Will that be all? Yes, sir. Let's go. So what happened? Nothing, Carl didn't do a damn thing. You're damn right. A man was standing behind the curtain. I didn't see no man. You want to go back and shake hands with him? Just take it easy. We'll find another one. Man, I can't figure these people. Did you see that guy? They wave at you like you're their best asshole buddy or something and then you go to their place of business and they start fingering their fucking weapons. Just a bunch of God-fearing, tractor-riding, beef-eating farmers. So boring, they don't even know they're alive. Did you see that fucker? Shit, man. How do I look, man? Huh? Like a little kid. Billy, come here. Put this shit in the car. Hey, tell them somebody's coming. What?Somebody's coming. Somebody's coming! Carl, wait! Somebody's coming. What are you talking about? Hey! Hi, how are you doing? What can I do for you boys?Hold it! Put that board down, put your hands over your head and get out! Come on! Billy, get the keys! Go on inside the house, go on, go on, you! Go on over there and sit down. I said sit down! No, on the floor! Give me your watches. Come on, empty your pockets. Y'all live here? Hey, I'm talking to you. Y'all live here? Yes. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Carl, come here. Hey, Billy, you stay here with them. If he moves, shoot him. What do you want to do? Tie them up, leave them here? Well, if we do, somebody could come by and see 'em, they could get loose or something. We're never gonna get out of Georgia. Why don't you boys just leave now before you really get in trouble. Can I smoke? Sure. We can take them with us... or we can kill them. Take them with us? Are you kidding? Look at the size of him. Well, that don't leave but one option. Which one do you want? I'll take the old one. Good. Got a light? Carl! Carl, this man wants to smoke, but he doesn't have a light. Get up. Just walk down to the end of the hall. Get up. Come on, get up! Come on. Lie down. What are you gonna do?Lie down on the bed! Take off that stupid hat! Come on, give it. Get on the bed. Roll over! Hey, Carl! [GUNSHOTS] Fuck. The old man don't want to die, did he? Come on, let's go!No! We got to wait a while. Why? That man said his wife was coming home in a few minutes. Here comes somebody! Is it a woman? A man riding something. Hell, it ain't nothing but a guy in a damn tractor. I'll bring him in. Just wait till he comes in the door. All right. [KNOCKING ON THE DOOR] Come on in! Who the hell! Who the hell are you? I'm God, that's who I am. Who are you? Take it easy. Take it easy. Who the hell are you? Take it easy, man. Come on. Come on. Take it easy or I'll blow off your fucking nose, man. What are you doing here? I came to see my brothers. You're lying!You heard the shots. No, I didn't hear any shots. Well, you're gonna. Come on! Come on! Take off that frog suit. What?Take off this frog suit. Come on, get down on the couch. Get down, you son of a bitch. Lay down! Put your legs up, come on. Get your legs up man. Lie on the couch man.Son of a bitch, son of a bitch! Billy, you ain't done one yet. Do him! Cock it. Come on. Do it! Go on, Billy, do him, man! No. [GUNSHOTS] I'm gonna go move the tractor. BILLY: It wasn't gonna end. More and more people were gonna come to that damn house, and we'd kill them all. One by one, the whole fucking town would knock on the door, my brothers would kill them too. Didn't matter anymore. Nobody would ever see them and they'd be dead. Let's go! Come on! Let's go, man. Get in the house. in the kitchen, baby. Where... where is Jerry? Shut up! Almost hit the damn flower pot. I won't tell... Two men in a truck are coming! Shit! All right, you come with me... you push out on me this time and that's it. Bro, stay with her. George, you look for anybody else coming. Jeez, you ought to be driving this... You take the passenger side, all right? Don't do anything till I do, okay? Get out of the truck, come on. Let's go! Come on, come on. Down on the floor! Both of you! Empty your pockets. Sit down on the floor and empty your pockets! Give me that watch. Here, give me that... give me that. Earring. What were y'all laughing at? We almost ran over Mary's flower pot. You were laughing at me. No, son, we weren't laughing at you. Don't you ever call me son. Same way? Might as well. Get up! Let's go! Walk down the end of the hallway.Let's go. George, you take this woman to the back room and you keep her there. Get in there!Oh, my God! Go on. Down on the floor! No, get up on the bed! Come on. Put your face down! [GUNSHOT] CARL: Billy! Give me your gun! [GUNSHOTS] [THUNDER RUMBLING] Where are the car keys? Where are they? BILLY: Don't, I'll get them. Where are they? Don't, don't, man! I'll get the keys. Here. All right, you load it. Watch her, I'm gonna go unload the stuff with Wayne. You want a glass of water or something? What? You want some water? Go on out there and help Wayne. Go! [THUNDER RUMBLING] Hand me them rifles, Billy. Where's Carl? He's inside, I'll go tell him we're through. [WOMAN GROANING] What do you want? Come on, Carl, leave her alone. Get the fuck out of here. [GROANING] Take the car in over there by them trees and find something in the trunk to wipe them down good. Y'all want any? No, I've had enough. Why don't you just leave her alone? What's the matter? Aren't you man enough to get some? I don't want any. Okay. No one's gonna hassle you about it. She's dead anyway. Carl, look, we can tie her up, we'll be long gone. Don't be stupid. Who's gonna do it? Hell, I'll do it. George. Get up. They're gonna come after us with everything they got. They ain't caught us so far. Don't see no reason to change that around. They didn't care a whole bunch before, Carl. I ain't going back to prison. No way. Then keep this thing between the ditches and let's get as far away from here as we can. These redneck cops they don't mess around, they flat out kill you. GEORGE: That man was looking at us real hard. So what, George? That's his job. They ain't looking for us here. Not yet, but they sure as hell will be. Over here. Why don't you and George get me a burger and some fries and a chocolate shake? Do you want anything? Nah, nothing. Bring Billy a burger. What's the matter with you, Billy? I can't take this no more, Carl. I want to go home. Home? What you gonna do when we get home? I don't know, I just want to go. We ain't gonna leave you out here in the middle of nowhere. They ain't got no chocolate so I said vanilla. What did you do to him? Not a damn thing. Billy is falling apart. He wants to go home. Well, hell, we'll just send him home. We ain't got no money, how are we gonna send him home? Well, we'll just rob something and put him on a bus. Might as well take him home. That suits me. George will be tickled to hear that. Let's go tell the little bastard. MAN: [ON TV] Our headline story tonight, escaped cons go on a rampage leaving six members of a Georgia family dead.

You have the absolute right to remain silent. Anything you say or write may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to consult a lawyer before any questioning and you have the right to have a lawyer with you during any questioning. Not only that, you have the right... Yeah, I heard it all before. You shut your mouth when I'm talking to you, boy. BILLY: Nothing mattered anymore. Not only that, you have the right to consult with a lawyer before any questioning... BILLY: Living and dying it was the same. But if you lack the financial ability to retain a lawyer, a lawyer will be appointed to represent you... BILLY: All I remember now was watching Carl and Wayne like I was watching a movie. The appointed lawyer present with you... Like it was Jesse James and the whole gang. Do you understand your rights as... And I was right there by their side in the movie with them. All the shooting and the killing and the robbing, it was gonna end. And when Carl and Wayne, they were done... all of those dead people, get up and take a bow... but they didn't... and they never will.
