(DRAMATIC MUSIC) The entire tribe must not be put in danger because of the defiance of one person. You must forget about him. He was a wild spirit, and this was always to be his fate. You talk as if he’s already dead. (WOOD CREAKS) Even if he does survive this time, he’s a greener. So it’s time to set your sights elsewhere for a husband. I’ll never set my sights elsewhere. (HORSE WHINNIES) This is all the medicine I could find. I’m sorry. The gods took your father in the night. (MUSIC CRESCENDOS) Noooooooo! As long as we stay here, there’ll never be enough to eat. Never. There may be other places we could live where the food is more plentiful. If a demon followed you back from the Forbidden Land, we’d all be struck down. Have you ever seen one? Have you? Has anyone here ever seen one? A demon! A monster! A beast! (Roars) The stories are true. The gods used to live in this world. They watched over and protected man, but man grew selfish and cruel. And so the gods left, allowing the demons to descend from the sky. As survivors, we must dedicate our lives to pleasing the gods so one day they will come back and drive away the demons. That is our fate. Only if you believe in fate. I’m sorry. I can’t take you, Chrissy. I can’t handle myself as well as a man? - No. - You arrogant greener. You can handle yourself better than most men, which is why you need to stay and help with the village. You know, your mother gave this to me before she died. She hoped it would be passed down to your children. It’s for good luck. You’d better not let anything happen to you out there. (Blows horn) (THUNDEROUS CRACKING) Easy! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - Oh! Oh! - (Neighs) Arggh! (ROARING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) So you’re the beast we’re all afraid of? Not a lot of meat on that dragon. (Grunts repeatedly) I see you’ve been fortunate in the hunt. I hope you thank the gods. (Roars and hisses) Looks like a nonbeliever. I believe what I can see. (Spits) Nonbeliever, huh? You from the caves? You’ve probably never seen a god. Would you like to see one? What do you know about gods? We have seen gods. - Rock and I, both. - You lying thieves! Argh! (Grunts) Hey. Wait a minute. We were hunting. We’ve no time to show you gods. We have no food. We need food. We must hunt. Nonbeliever. Wait! (Snorts) First, you show me the god. Then we eat. Look. Frozen ones. The way to the great god village is marked by these frozen ones. ROCK: When the gods left this world, they ordered man not to look at them. Those that disobeyed were frozen in place for eternity. CARLO: When the gods lived here, they could fly through air. They’d drive their chariots in front of special caves with golden arches. Golden. And the food would magically appear. Magic. ROCK: Here, the gods weren’t allowed to fall in love with mortal women. But this one did, and was left behind, frozen, as punishment. Are you sure this thing was a god? I thought you said you believe what you can see. If you need more proof, when the sun goes down you can see the gods in the night sky. They’re the bright lights up there, watching down on us. CARLO: Come, come. The evil beasts hunt in the dark. We need to find shelter. There’s a cave over here. Look at those poor bastards. Now, they really, really angered the gods. Carlo, let’s eat. Go! Go! What’s a greener? The grass is always greener on the other side. I was looking for something better. Something out there. Maybe she was right. Godstone. Sharp! No, you keep it. You keep it. Where we’re from, a good woman is hard to find, so if you were stupid enough to leave a perfectly good woman behind, why don’t you tell me where she is so I can go get her for myself? - No... - (Yells) Arggh! Forget about me! Get the hell out of here! - I can’t move! - (Whistles) (Neighs) Noooooooo! Oh, heavenly gods! (ENGINE ROARS) (Yells) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (Speaks Psychlo) (Man coughs) It’s poison! My chest is on fire! (Speaks Psychlo) It helps you breathe! Take it! - I can’t... - Take it! (Yells) Get off my brother! - What’s he saying? - Don’t know. - Arggh! - (Speaks Psychlo) (Yells) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Oh! Oh! (Laughs) (Speaks Psychlo) (Speaks) (Chokes) Who’s responsible for not supervising this man-animal? The man-animal shot the wrangler, sir. I’m a little pressed for time. Save the going-away jokes for later! No, sir. I swear! The man-animal somehow got hold of his gun. Really? (Speaks Psychlo) Show me. Sir? (Grunts) - Reach for the gun. - Sir, I might get shot. You might! And I might suddenly grow a third arm! Sir, I swear it shot the wrangler! Every report filed today still has my name on it, and you are out of your skullbone if you think I’ll write on the report, “Shot by man-animal!’’ as the cause of death unless I see it! If I obey your command, I may get killed. And if you don’t, it’s certain that you will be killed. Reach for the gun. (Psychlo yells) Well, I’ll be damned. Hmm. (Laughs) (Humans cry out) (Yells) Arggh! (Speaks Psychlo) (WHIRRING) COMPUTER: Teleportation sequence activated. (WHIRRING CONTINUES) Teleportation sequence activated. (WHIRRING CONTINUES) (Speaks Psychlo) (Psychlo guard yells) It is a pleasure to see you, Your Excellency. And I’d be honoured to expedite your clearance through security. Please, call me Zete. Does all of Earth look like this? Oh, I’m afraid so, sir. Pathetic. All the green, and the blue sky. They told me this planet was ugly, but this is one of the ugliest crapholes in the entire universe. I couldn’t agree with you more. I hate these puny, undersized planets. The gravity is so...different. Well, one does get used to it. The human animals are grossly undersized. They don’t make very good eating, Your Excellency. Ah, yes. My executive assistant, Ker. Thank you. Fully trained to replace me as chief of security. As soon as my transfer goes through. Well, Ker, once we finish mining out this miserable little planet, let’s do the universe a favour! Let’s exterminate the lot of them. (Both laugh) Oh, you’re too much! So they tell me. Please, come this way. KER: Our spy satellites recorded those images. ZETE: What is this species? According to the Clinko historians, the species is called ‘dog’. - ‘Dog’. - Yes. Obviously the superior race, having the man-animal chauffeur it around. Yes, well, dogs did prove to be, more cooperative than man-animals. For some reason, they weren’t as useful when it came to manual labour. I am honoured by your visit, Your Excellency. Well, thank you, Planetship. You’ll be pleased to know I’ve approved additional labour resources. I’ll have them sent here by the end of quarter cycle. Thank you, Your Excellency. Now, then. Let’s see. Oh! Your long-overdue transfer! You must be looking forward to getting off this disgusting excuse of a planet. I just want to do whatever serves the corporation best, sir. Very admirable, and I must say you’ve done a first-rate job here as interim security chief. Here, here! Here, here! Oh, I do what I can! Which is why we’ve decided to keep you on for another tour of service. There must be some mistake. Oh, Home Office does not make mistakes. Course not, but have you looked at my file, sir? It explicitly says that this is a temporary assignment. Yes. Are you not aware that I graduated top of my class? Quite an accomplishment. I don’t mean to second-guess the Home Office, but surely I could be of better service to the corporation... Home Office is well aware of your academic achievements and obvious talents. That’s why we’ve decided not to keep you here for another five cycles. (Laughs) KER: It’s a joke! Oh, thank you, sir. I don’t know if I could have kept my sanity to be here another five cycles. We’ve decided to keep you here for another 50 cycles! With endless options for renewal! (Echoes) With endless options for renewal! (Laughs maniacally) Those options, of course, being at Home Office’s discretion. Not yours. The Senator... has a lot of friends. (Echoes)..has a lot of friends. Will you please tell the Senator that if I had even an inkling that that was his daughter... Watch your tongue. The Senator’s exact words to me were, and I’m quoting, “If that blasted Terl tries to talk his way out of it, “have him vaporised on the spot.’’ But cheer up. There’s one bright side to this. One day you’re going to die. And when you end up in hell, at least it will be a step up from this place. (Laughs) (EXPLOSIONS) (PSYCHLO MUTTERING) You haven’t left for Psychlo. (Grunts) Your powers of observation are simply startling. Give me three pans to go. I don’t know what you’re so down about. You still get to be head of security, which, from what I can tell, is a pretty cushy job. I can assure you that I was not groomed since birth to have some cushy job, that even a moron like you could perform. (Scoffs) While you were still learning how to spell your name, I was being trained to conquer galaxies. And to do anything less is a disgrace to my entire family line. That’ll be six credits. Put it on my tab. You don’t have a tab. I do now. (Chuckles) (Speaks Psychlo) (Grunts) OK. You’re new here, so I’ll explain how it works. I eat first, then my men eat. If there’s anything left, you can share it with the rest. - That’s how it used to work. - Come here. - Let’s just stay alive. - You’re right. - So I’ll fight you. - No, no! If we don’t get food, we don’t have strength to escape. - So now we’re escaping? - I am. - You come with me if you want. - Heeeya! (Both grunt) We fight...to the death! (Screams) (Crowd cheers) Come on! Better say your prayers to the gods. Arrgh! (SILENCE) We’ve enough problems without killing each other over food! From now on, we eat at the same time. I was wondering when you were going to look at that. It came in last week and I put it right in your box. I’ve wasted my time, haven’t I? Sir? If you’re going to lie, have the decency to do a credible job, so I don’t look like an idiot for having tried to train you. I’m not lying, sir. I put the photo in your box when it came in. You are pathetic. You wouldn’t last one day at the academy... ..and I saw you. You said we used picto-cameras to spy on other officers, but under no circumstance spy on our own office. That’s right. WE don’t. I do. Start talking! The photos from last week’s recon run — it shows a rock slide in the mountains. It exposed a gold vein. You’re waiting for my transfer so you can turn it in and get all the credit. - I didn’t think you’d mind. - I don’t mind. Turn it in. But before you do, pretend that you’re not a complete imbecile and check the compo-gradients. The mountain’s full of uranium. No Psychlo could get there without his breath gas exploding. There’s no way to mine the gold. What I do mind is that you betrayed me over a lousy recon photo. But it’s worthless. You said so yourself. But you didn’t know it was worthless. Arrrgh! I would never hurt you, sir. I’m unarmed. You can’t shoot me. It’s against regulations, sir. I could make this up to you, sir. I promise, I swear. Please, sir. This...you do not have to shoot me, sir. (Laughs) Shoot you? My most trusted colleague? Of course not. We have work to do, Ker. Tomorrow morning we must warn the Planetship of the mutiny. What mutiny? The one that you’re going to pretend is in the works, like your life depended on it... ..because it does. If the worker revolt takes place, my informants tell me that the first order of business is to separate you from your head. Which is why there will be no revolt. I am authorising you to use whatever means necessary to prevent it. The best way to stop it is to increase profits and stop cutting the workers’ pay. Production equals profits. And I’ve already ordered as many new workers as possible to boost production. But we have to pay the new workers. Maybe you were absent the day they taught economics at the academy, Ker, but nobody works for free. Man-animals do. What if we were to train them how to mine? (Sniggers) (Both laugh) Man-animals operating machinery? ( Laughs) Have you blown a head gasket? I will be the laughing-stock of the universe. Which is why I should take a group of man-animals, with equipment, to a remote area, better that you don’t know where, and try and train them. Have them do some... test mining. That way, if it doesn’t work out no-one will know. Right. And if it does work, I will be vaporised. It is against the law! According to regulations, a Planetship faced with a profit-threatening situation is relieved of all other ordinances to pursue, to protect and to acquire said profits. And there you have it. We stick to the original plan. Bring in new workers. And they go on half-pay as soon as they arrive. And that is final! (CHAOTIC MUSIC) (Workers scream) Get down! Run! RUN! (TENSE MUSIC) (Speaks Psychlo) (Chokes) OK. Pull his breath mask off. (Gasps) Last time we didn’t even stop timing until its lungs burst. That’s the wager. (All laugh) No way this man will last more than four minutes. Help me! Help me! I need your air! Wager’s off. The damn thief cheated. (Workers scream) TERL: The Planetship is hiding something. All we have to do is find out what it is, then we’ll have leverage over him. And then we can get the gold. What do you mean ‘we’? It’s my plan. I’m sending the gold to Psychlo and getting off this stinking planet. Come on, sir! You got to let me in on it. I barely make any lousy credits in this job, and I’ve got five wives to support, sir. I don’t know if I want to partner up with an idiot. How do I even know that you understand the plan? We train man-animals— who don’t need breath gas— to mine the gold for us. The home planet owns this planet. The gold belongs to them. That’s the beauty of it. Home planet doesn’t even know the gold exists. So those corporate crapheads won’t even know we stole it. It’s the perfect crime, sir. Putting aside the serious violations of teaching mining to an inferior race and insulting corporate superiors, each one in itself punishable by death, so it is my duty to report you, even though you’ll be vaporised and I’ll have to train a new assistant. - But it’s your stinking plan. - That’s right. So I’m glad I’ve a picto-recording of you laying out the plan and my reprimanding you for it. Think of it as part of your education. Education, huh? Never engage in a criminal activity unless you have a patsy to pin everything on, in case you ever get found out. Thank you. That’s great. Why do I have to be the patsy, sir? So you don’t get bright ideas about getting rid of old Terl and keeping all the gold for yourself. But I would never double cross you, sir. Of course not, because I’ve already arranged that if any unfortunate accident befalls me, this would go straight to the Home Office. (FAST-PACED MUSIC) (Gasps) (Screams continuously) Noooo! Alright, double or nothing I can blow off one of its limbs without missing. (GUNSHOT) Aaaaahhh! TERL: That one seems to be unusually intelligent and resourceful, but it’s also defiant, which means we’ll need leverage over it. Over a man-animal? Man is a primitive species, so we’ll need something primitive for leverage... ..like food. What do you think a man-animal would like to eat? What do you think he would consider a treat? How the crap should I know? There’s no way of knowing that, sir. But before we educate it on a learning machine, we’ll take it to the mountains along with a couple of others. Let them think they’ve escaped. Then we’ll sit back and watch it choose its favourite food. Yes. Look. KER: Three days, and they still haven’t eaten anything yet. Precisely. Now the man-animals feel they’ve a safe distance from us, they’ll find their favourite food and celebrate. What is it? Food...food! Floyd? There’s plenty to burn, nothing to start fire with. (Ker groans) - That’s their favourite food? - Of course it is. They could have selected anything they wanted. - But it’s not even cooked. - (Sighs) If man-animal prefers its rat uncooked, then our job is that much easier. If they like their rat so much, how come two aren’t eating? Don’t you know anything? The leader of the pack always eats first. See? We’re really going to have leverage over them now. (TAP! TAP! ) What are you doing? They know about the button camera. Don’t be a knothead. It’s a man-animal. They couldn’t possibly know about... Hmm. You sure called that one, sir. No way they know about the picto-camera. Well move your fat ass, and let’s go round them up! Aaahh! Crap-lousy ceiling! I thought I told you to get some man-animals to fix it! Great! This is great. What the hell do we do now? Jonnie...don’t you even think about it. You wouldn’t live this jump. You wouldn’t live the jump. You can surrender and rot in those cages. It’s your choice, but I’m not going back. Let the monsters catch us. They’ll take us to the mines. - Aaaaahhhh! - Noooo! Run! Run! (Roars) Go. How are we supposed to know what he wants? Just follow what I do and you’ll be fine. (Psychlo growls) Don’t touch anything. Get these creatures mad and think what they’ll do to us. Aarrghh! (Chokes) Excuse me, but I am your instructor, if you will forgive such arrogance. For I do not have the honour to be a Psychlo. I am but a lowly Clinko language slave. As you are listening to me, I most likely do not exist as we may have been exterminated, like many other races, by the gas drones of our conquerors. Please forgive my pretension as I try to educate you in Psychlo, the noble language of our superiors. (Gasps) (INCOHERENT MUTTERING) (JUMBLED VOICES) (Gasps) (Speaks Psychlo) (Psychlo becomes English) You...understand...you... ..you...under...understand me? Are you hungry...little fellow? Yes? Obviously, this is going to take a while. (JUMBLED VOICES RESUME) (Workers grunt) Jonnie...Jonnie! Jonnie! (Speaks Psychlo) Oh, God. Oh, God! I know who they are, where they’ve come from. I can speak their language. - What did they do to him? - They made him look into a light. - It’s a god machine. - No, it’s a knowledge machine. It sends pictures through your head so fast... - OK. - ..it’s spinning. Come on. Let’s go, Jonnie. No, I can’t. I have to stay. I have to learn more about them. This may be... This may be our only way out of here. So, this is the monsters’ language. No, this is mathematics. This is the unifying language of the entire universe. (Breathes heavily) Look. (Scratches ground) This symbol is called a triangle. If all...the sides...are equal, then these three angles must also be equal. Equal to what? To each other. It’s the basic foundation of Euclidean geometry. It seems pretty hard to understand. No, no. Only at first. Then it becomes clear to you. You see, I learned something called molecular biology. This is the symbol for water. And engineering. See, the wing... See? And line. And form. And artistic composition. You see, this... this is a square, like a cage. I thought you were supposed to be working to help us escape. This will. All this will. (Speaks Psychlo) Jonnie. Jonnie. Human. Uh... Uh, “The security chief should...secure the field vault “with an eight-digit combination code. “And do not use a personal or employee identification number.’’ What’s an identification number? Er...there. Right there. - How many numbers is that? - Eight. Eight? - Eight. - Eight. Guess the creature’s more clever than that. The question is how clever. Er, I’ll try the numbers backwards. Oh! Look at this. It’s a recording machine. Oh, this is how he watches us. (Sounds horn) (HAUNTING MUSIC) Stop! Chrissy, stop! What if he’s not dead? Hope is an admirable quality, but foolish isn’t. I CAN’T give you permission to go out there and get killed. I don’t need your permission. I’m no longer a child. (Gasps) Do you want lunch? It’s obviously too much to ask a man-animal thing to learn a language as sophisticated as Psychlo. Maybe it can understand Psychlo, and pretending it can’t. Why the HELL would it do that? Maybe it’s secretly listening. Trying to get leverage over us. (Scoffs) Man-animal getting leverage over a Psychlo. - That’ll be the day. - (Laughs) Whoa, what if this one’s particularly stupid? Maybe we should try to trade another one. There’s no time. When they detect the gold, they’ll know what we’re doing. - (Grunts) - Arrggh! We’ll have to terminate the operation and cover our tracks. (Speaks Psychlo) - (Speaks Psychlo) - (Jonnie repeats phrase) It speaks Psychlo! Go on, say something else. You’re gonna stay here as my prisoner, while, you — you go and get a transporter. (Both laugh) Just because you’ve learned Psychlo, doesn’t make you one. If you don’t follow my orders, I’ll have you killed. (Laughs) How exactly do you plan to do that? (Screams) (Screams) Mickey, no! (Chokes) If ANY of you rat brains knew anything about firearms, you’d know that you never store loaded weapons. You drop him now! You drop him or I won’t mine an ounce of your gold. I’ll have you vaporised and I’ll find someone else to mine the gold. You don’t have time. You can’t hide this from Home Office forever. A man getting leverage over a Psychlo — that’ll be the day. (Shouts) I think it’s time that we show our little friend a thing or two. As long as you cling to the feeble hope that you could ever get the better of me, you’ll be distracted from the more important things. Which is exactly why... ..I share the following with you. When we attacked your planet, all your soldiers and all their advanced technology could only put up a measly nine-minute fight before they were exterminated. Which is why man is an endangered species. Everything you humans knew is here. And you can look at anything you want, because there is nothing that will help you. (MUSIC CRESCENDOS) Satisfied? Yes. I have one more demonstration for you and your little friends. You will soon be relocated to a new mining site. And if any of you get any bright ideas about escaping, just remember, although you know nothing about firearms, I certainly do. I graduated top marksman in my class, and I could kill any one of you at over a thousand paces. - Tell them what I’ve said. - Try to run, he’ll kill us. - That’s it? - Yes. Allow me to demonstrate. (Fires gun repeatedly) (Roars) No! No! Wait! Wait! No! Go back. No! Get him, Jonnie! Let’s give this...demon what it deserves. Shoot, I say! Destroy it! Shoot! Shoot! Kill it! Kill it! Then we’ll rob it... (Angrily) Then what? What kind of life is it to run? Always living in fear? What about the others we’re leaving behind? - What about them? - There’s nothing. Nothing we can do for them. Only the gods can free them! Do you think the lights in the night sky are gods waiting to save us? Those are planets! Planets like this one. The great villages were built by our people. By millions of men and women just like us, willing to fight to the death for one thing above all— their freedom. MAN: Do you think no-one has tried? You CAN’T defeat them. (Echoes) You can’t defeat them. That...is our fate. (Echoes) Our fate. Yes, we can. Yes, we can! We have to go back. We go back and learn about their weapons and machinery. Our race is slowly dying and will soon be gone forever. Let it be said that we took this one chance...and FOUGHT! Are you with me? (Yells) Are you with me? - Yeah. - Yeah — we fight! Yeah! If you’re fighting the beast, me and my men are with you. Thank you. It’s good to have friends out here. May the gods be with you. (All cheer) Surely someone as wise as you has ways to stop them from shooting. I know that if I’d tried, you would’ve killed me first. Damn right, rat brain. That’s the first intelligent thing you’ve said yet. (Chokes) Rest break is over. There’s something I need you to see. It’s imperative that you are properly motivated. You don’t know her? No. I don’t know her. In fact, she’s one of the foulest-looking females I’ve ever seen. While I tend to agree, it’s obvious that man-animals show a lack of aptitude for strategic deception. On the other hand, what you show marginal proficiency at is... ..drawing. This was found on her when she was collected. The collar around her neck has enough explosive to remove her head from her body. And this remote will activate the explosive from anywhere on the planet. So if you choose to disobey me, I’ll show you what will happen. Please...please don’t harm her. I believe you. (Scoffs) Don’t worry, rat brain. Every collar has its own frequency. I’m not going to blow up your little female friend. Just, er... ..this one. You’ve made your point. - Sammy... - I said I would mine your gold! Please, don’t kill him... Please! Fine. As a gesture to our new working relationship, I will grant you this one request. I won’t kill him. But you may NEVER ask of me anything again. I promise. As I said... ..I won’t kill him. Pleasure. (EXPLOSION) (EERIE SILENCE) (Laughs) Stupid humans. No, no, no... What you did was right. It was right for all of us. You’re a thinker, and the gods respect thinkers. You didn’t kill Sammy. Jonnie, this is not living. This is...this is... ..cages...cages! Even if we were to escape and go back to where we came from, it’d be like you said. We’d look over our shoulders waiting for the Psychlos. I think THAT is not living, either. We all chose to fight. MAN: Count us in, too! WOMAN: What’s going on? MAN: Somebody in that cage knows Psychlo! He’s gonna help us fight. (All cheer) (HEROIC MUSIC) (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) Ah, yes. Ker, I’d like you to meet Chirk. - (Grunts) - She’s, um...she’s, um... His soon-to-be newly acquired secretary. - Yes. - Really? (Whispers) She’s stupid enough not to be a menace. Good-looking enough to be decorative. She gets drunk with economical speed. (Loudly) And has other advantages. Oh, I can see that. - Don’t you have work to do? - No. Ker. Alright, sir. Now, listen, Missy. I’m still waiting for the Planetship’s accounts. I had to go WAY beyond the call of duty to get these. I see. Maybe that’s why I especially chose you. So, you’ll keep your side of the bargain? Er, which was? You said we’ll have a huge house when we return to Psychlo. - We’ll be rich, right? - Right. I’m going to make you as happy as a baby Psychlo on a straight diet of ferbango. (Both laugh) Well, isn’t it interesting that you have been keeping two sets of books. And telling all the workers the planet has been operating at a loss. I...I only claimed that it was running at a loss to try and...motivate them all to work harder. (Laughs) Of course. And it had nothing to do with the fact it could allow you to cut the workers’ pay and keep the extra credit for yourself, did it? Ah, that. Well, I can explain! Well, unfortunately, the company requires me to vaporise you. But on the other hand, I could understand someone in your situation, being old and having no future, could come up with creative ways to solve your financial problems. (Stutters) You can? Oh, yes. It’s really of no interest to anybody to have you not be Planetship, but it would be prudent to start to share your authority. But these forms are all blank. Undated. You could put anything you wanted on them. YOU would run the entire planet. I...would be nothing but a puppet. Well, if you don’t want to do it that way, we could always do it by...the book. What the hell does the Planetship need with all this mining equipment? That’s not even the crazy part. He’s ordered me to take a group of man-animals out to a remote area WITH the equipment to see if they can be trained to mine. Man-animals being able to mine. Yes. The old Psychlo’s going completely insane. Indeed. But what can I do? An order is an order. (Sighs) You have a busy day, rat brain. First learning how to fly, and then on to the learning machine for mining techniques. (EXPLOSION) Crash one more time, rat brain, and your friend won’t be among the living. Again. Again! Never underestimate what a little leverage can do, rat brain. (TENSE MUSIC) That's good, man-animal. (Shouts) This is a lever. When we mine the coal— lever up, down. VOICE ON SPEAKER: Warning! External sensors indicate dangerous radiation levels ahead. This is as far as I can go. Land it! (Exhales) Meet me here, in 14 days and I want the ship’s cage at least half-filled with gold. And even though I won’t be at the mining site... ..I’ll be watching you. Oh, oh. - How’s your side? - It’s good. Good, good, good. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh! Oh, next time, you fly. (Grunts) No, no, no, no. Even if we mine enough gold, we’ll be lucky to fill half of that cage in time. We’re not doing any mining. What about the big uglies watching us with that eye in the sky? God, look. Here. Here’s the men, alright? We split them in half, and one group goes and one group stays and it looks as if we’re still working. No, no, no. If we haven’t got the gold in 14 days to Terl, then he’ll kill us. There’s a place called Fort Knox where the gold’s already mined. There will be no mining. But we are going to deliver. OK, so, so... ..we have to pretend that we’re mining the gold. We have to figure out where we’re going to get the gold. Then we have to get the supplies to help our revolt. Yeah. We have barely enough men to do one of those things, let alone all three. (HOWLING) It’s good to have friends on the outside, eh! (All whoop) (Laughs) (Howls) Come on! You two keep your eyes open. Look for ocean — if you see any, we’ve gone too far. Oh, I think this is it. I think we’ve crossed over into Washington. - No. We’re still in Colorado. - What? That’s impossible. - No, we didn’t cross this line. - You’re not paying attention. Carlo, you let him navigate. You watch me. You’re flying this back. But...it’s impossible. We couldn’t have crossed these lines without me seeing one. Well, we did, OK? The lines must’ve just faded over time. (MAJESTIC MUSIC) JONNIE: This great village was the capital for all of our tribes. This is where our people’s history was buried. Here. The Psychlos attacked Earth. They sent out flying gas drones. Our ancestors must have made it out into these remote radiated areas, and the only reason they survived was because radiation has a lethal reaction with the Psychlo’s breathing gas. - That was not good for them. - It’s good for us. Even if we fail, people will be saved if they stay in there. They’re safe from being hunted. Radiation is also poisonous for humans. So you see, either way... ..if we don’t take back our planet, the last of humanity becomes extinct. (Sighs) (YELLING) It’s coming! Come on! Come on! Based on what I’ve read about Psychlo security, if we were to stage a revolt, only using weapons they don’t perceive as any real threat— if we just use rocks and sticks, they’ll just herd us together and throw us back in the cages. But— we’re going to stage this revolt inside the dome. So the Psychlos are going to have to come inside the city to round us up. And that is when we blow the dome. Carlo’s going to blow the dome. - Want to have breath masks on. - They can’t breathe. - They all die. - Carlo? - I’m going to blow the dome? - You’re blowing the dome. Piece of cake. Piece of cake, piece of cake. (All laugh) But what you have to remember is that as soon as we blow the dome, boom. - Stage two alarm. - What is that? Thousands of gas drones and troops are going to be teleported down here. - We can’t fight against that. - Then what’s the point? We kill all the monsters on Earth, they send more. We’ll get wiped out. The point is we don’t let it get to stage two. We’re going to destroy their home planet before it happens. - Their home planet? - Their home planet. Oh. We’ll need some extra supplies before we can do that. So our first stop is a radiation bomb storage bunker. Is everyone clear? Count us in. - Look. - Flying machines? Mickey, these are flying machines. Weapons of some kind. Flying spears. I think there’s a little more to it than that. Whoo! Whoo, whoo, whoo! It’s a learning machine. Teach us to fly. You’re right. It’s like breaking a horse. You sure you can teach your men to fly this? Piece of cake! Piece of cake. Piece of cake. - Try and keep it level. - Jonnie! - What is it? - I think I found one. Come on. Come on! It’s a nuclear firebomb! Piece of cake. According to the book, there’s a firing mechanism that has to be in place before it’s operational. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. (Breathes heavily) Don’t touch the autosensor. What happens if we do? The bomb will explode. Big fire. Look. (BOMB BEEPS REPEATEDLY) From this cave. (Whispers) Off. Off. Off. (BOMB BEEPS CONTINUOUSLY) (Disengages bomb) “War’’. “Ning’’. - Ning? Warning. Warning. - Warning. Warning. War...ning. Get it? (Breathes heavily) What does the autosensor look like? Ah, there’s an illustration in appendix A. Which is... What? What? We don’t have appendix A. - More books, Jonnie. - Books. Arggh! - Arggh! - It’s OK. It’s OK. I thought you said nuclear fires were powerful. It’s not nuclear. Mickey! - Sorry. - You’re sorry? Mickey! Would you stop touching things and turn off the damn light?! Wait. Leave it on, Mickey. Look. Look. Oh. Good work, Mickey. You just found appendix A. This’ll be enough to blow up their whole planet? Radiation reacts with the planet’s atmosphere. There’s enough there to destroy it forever. Let me do it. Let me go to their planet and detonate the weapon. It’s brave of you Mickey, but it’s my plan, so I go. Jonnie, you’re the only one who speaks the monsters’ language. You know things about them. Listen. Without you leading this revolt... ..we might not succeed. (ENGINE ROARS) Let’s hope their eye in the sky didn’t see the gold through the lead walls of this cave. Start filling the cage. We’ll hide half in the mountains, and deliver the other half to Terl tonight. Why is it in bars? I... ..I assumed, sir, that a Psychlo of your refinement wouldn’t settle for anything as coarse as raw ore. (Drops bar) Really? (MACHINE BEEPS) Well, since you rat brains have had enough extra time to smelt it into bricks, I’ll now expect the rest of the gold in seven days. (CRACKING EXPLOSION) You know he has no intention of sharing that gold with you. What the hell are you talking about? Now what are you even doing here? You’re supposed to be mining the gold. You think he only made that recording to have you as his patsy? Do you, Ker? No. He has leverage over you. And it’ll guarantee you never see an ounce. How do you know about those recordings, you man-animal? It really is amazing, the collection of disks you can find in Terl’s personal vault. (Grunts quietly) First, we trade. The disk... I don’t think so! If you don’t give me the disk right now, I will blow your head off. (Grunts repeatedly) Hey! Hey! (All grunt) Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh! Whoa. You want to trade? Let’s trade. MAN: Hurry! What’d the Psychlo say about wearing this collar? After tonight, it won’t matter much either way. Jonnie, I know you don’t believe in fate, but I’ve always known this was going to be your destiny. This is our destiny. It’s freedom for all of us. For our children. Children? Beautiful. MAN: Quickly! MAN: Come on, hurry! (Terl laughs) Well, this is particularly stupid. (Grunts) As soon as they detect the gold, they’ll know exactly what we’re doing. - (Grunts) - KER: Oh... We’ll have to terminate the operation and cover our tracks. (Laughs) As soon as they detect the gold, they’ll know exactly what we’re doing. - (Grunts) - KER: Oh... (Sighs) .. terminate the operation and cover our tracks. I’ve been thinking. 80/20 is a pretty fair distribution of the gold. But I should get the 80%. And with my share, I’m going to fire all my wives and buy new ones. (Laughs) Maybe pretty ones this time. (Laughs) Chirk! (Laughs loudly) Congratulations. You’ve finally learned how to get proper leverage over someone, haven’t you? Uh-huh. Which means I haven’t wasted my time training you. - You’re not upset? - Don’t be crazy. Do you know how long I’ve waited for this day? I know the perfect way to celebrate. (Laughs) What are you doing? You can’t shoot me. I made a copy and gave it to someone for safekeeping. You are just too good of a teacher. (Laughs) How about giving your old teacher a clue as to who this might be? You insult yourself, sir. You know you taught me better than that. How do I know who it is? I don’t know. (Laughs) I mean, it could be anybody on this damn planet. - It could be...a mechanic. - No. - It could be a concubine. - No, no, no. Anybody in the communications office. - Wrong. (Laughs) - I hate this. I feel like it’s a test that I’m not prepared for. Well, hell, it could even be... ..our friendly bartender! Please. I made a mistake. Now, give me the original disk, then meet meat the teleportation platform in two hours. Sir. MICKEY ON RADIO: Patrol bunker’s to the right. Three guards left. Two in front of the guard house. One from the north. I’ll take the two in the guard house. (ALARM BEEPS) Oh... Oh! (Grunts) (Grunts) Oh! (Grunts) (Psychlo grunts) (Laughs) Arggh! (Speaks Psychlo) Chrissy... RADIO: Jonnie. The shooting’s triggered the alarm. Five guards from the south, heavily-armed and moving fast! They’re between you and the bunker. Jonnie! RADIO: The man - animals have escaped. They’re running into the city. Send some guards out and round them up. I’m busy! And don’t bother me with every little detail. Go round them up. Psychlos! Psychlo! (Speaks Psychlo) Seven, seven, three. Greener, it's Carlo. The explosives are set. Can I blow the dome? CARLO ON RADIO: What’s going on? Talk to me. - Jonnie, talk to me. - Hold on! Hold on. If I don’t get Mickey to Psychlo, they’ll send drones. Just hurry up. ’Cause I’ve got company. (Psychlo groans) (Speaks Psychlo) Yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh! Oh! Yeah! (Laughs) Go! (Mouths inaudibly) (Speaks Psychlo) (Howls) (Inhales) COMPUTER: Airlock doors open. Here they are. (Pants fearfully) (Gasps) (EXCITING MUSIC) Whoah! Oooh! (BEEPING) (Screams) (EXCITING MUSIC CONTINUES) Hang on! I’m right on his tail. (Screams battle cry) (Pants) OK. You know what you’ve got to do? (Softly) Go. (ELECTRICAL WHINE) Come on, come on! I’ve got to blow this dome now! I’m teleporting Mickey and the bomb now, Carlo. Hang on. I’m seconds away. (TENSE MUSIC) Jonnie, come on. They’re destroying the bombs. It’s now or never. Now! Go ahead! Blow the dome! Go! Go! Go! COMPUTER: Teleportation sequence terminated. Interrupting something? CHRISSY ON RADIO: Jonnie! Jonnie! (Chokes) (Roars) - MAN: Let’s go! Let’s go! - (People whimper fearfully) MAN: Why isn’t it coming down? (CRACKING, CREAKING) MAN: The dome is holding! It’s not working! WOMAN: It’s only cracked! CHRISSY ON RADIO: The dome isn’t broken, Carlo. We can’t hold out. (Chokes) Attention! This is Terl, your chief of security. Exterminate all man-animals at will. And happy hunting! (Speaks Psychlo) WOMAN: Run! Run! (MACHINE-GUN FIRE) (YELLING, SCREAMING) Ugh! (Whimpers) What’s going on with the dome? Hold on. I’m taking it out now. (Grunts aggressively) (Hollers battle cry) (ZAPPING) (CRACKING) (Psychlos grunt brutishly) (DIN OF BATTLE) MAN: They’re killing us! (GUNFIRE, SCREAMING) (EXPLOSION) We’re not going to make it! I think we should pull out! I’m blowing the dome in five! Four! Three. Two. One. Piece of cake. (SHATTERING) Everyone underground! Now! Go! Go! (Hollers battle cry) (Psychlos scream) (POWERFUL MUSIC) Aaarrggghhhh! Look out! COMPUTER: Teleportation sequence activated. COMPUTER: Teleportation sequence activated. Psychlo war centre, this is a stage three alert. I repeat, a stage three alert. Initiate the gas drone extermination sequence. (OMINOUS RUMBLING) You have been quite a challenge, rat brain! You’ll make a hell of a conversation piece when you’re stuffed and hanging on the wall at the academy. (Screeches) (Grunts with exertion) Yaaaaaaaaaa! (ZAPPING) (TENSE MUSIC BUILDS) Where’s the rest of my gold? I’ll exchange it for my woman’s life. I know my life is over, but surely hers is of no consequence to you. Thanks for reminding me, rat brain. Now, where is it?! Trust me. You don’t want to do that. Trust me. There’s nothing I want more. Ugh! (GENTLE, HEROIC MUSIC) Carlo came through. (ROMANTIC MUSIC SWELLS) (SOMBRE MUSIC) Why don’t you vaporise me? Leverage. If there are other Psychlo colonies out there, they’ll send out their gas drones and exterminate us. But if they learn that it was your greed that destroyed their home planet... ..then all the credits in the universe won’t equal to the bounty that they put on your head. (Laughs) But there is one thing that you rat brains weren’t smart enough to realise. - Kill them! - (Gasps) I fixed the problem with it. It works fine now. You imbecile! What kind of crap-lousy game are you playing? I’m teaching them all about our technology. They made me the Head Psychlo. (Laughs) Look at the bright side. You may not be wallowing in luxury on Psychlo... ..but, at least, you finally got your gold. (Laughs)
