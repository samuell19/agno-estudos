-Wartberg. -Lisa, dear. Emergency! Where are you? -We're on air in eight minutes! -Fred, I know. But first, I was boxed in. And it was too late anyway. Plus... -Other line. Wartberg. -Thirty minutes ago, Lisa. -What happened then? -Oh, no! Our appointment. Boss, just two minutes! I'll be right... Could you hold the line? Wartberg. Right. Thanks, Mom. Could you just hold? -Fred, today will be... -Wrong line, Lisa. Unless you want your boss to do your makeup today. Oh, no! I'm so sorry, boss. One minute. Fred, where were we? The eyelashes. I remember your birth, way back then at 5.33 in the morning. Mom, my boss is on another line. My stressed-out makeup artist is on a third. I baked a cake for you. You're coming, aren't you? When? Today? Do you know the last time we saw each other? Of course, that was... recently... It's called Christmas. Hold on. And it was half a year ago. We're going live in three minutes. Relax, darling! Evil worry lines. Evil! I'm trying, Fred. I'm trying. -We'll do it! I'll do it! -Test! Test! If the mic cracks again, you'll be delivering pizzas. How often do I have to say it? Warm lights! Soft! Not like at the gynecologist! Since I first saw you on TV... I've been your role model. I'm the reason you're blonde. Lesson 1. Cut the blah blah. And more coffee! Thanks, Polly. But... my name is... My name's Sabine! All her assistants are called Polly. Are you trying to poison me, Polly? This isn't decaf hazelnut cinnamon! -You're fired. -But today's my first day. Attention, everyone! You're not a team You're a total disaster From the assistant all the way up to the producer I'm a TV star and nothing is more abhorrent Than dilettantes without any talent I've never experienced a perfect show If this continues I'll start losing my patience And just in case you produce a lot of crap again today You'll all be fired and it's not my fault Thanks for the compliments Thanks How sweet of you Sometimes life likes to play a game of cat and mouse with you There will always be someone who outplays you Thanks for the compliments Thanks! How sweet of you! Three minutes till we broadcast! Jazz hands. You don't even get B-listers anymore. Not even C-listers! Where are we in the alphabet now? XYZ? And your ratings? They were here, then here. And then... My back won't even let me get down that far. I mean... As a woman of action we esteemed you highly We were your greatest fans for years But your ratings have started stagnating There's already internal consensus to get rid of you I hoped for ages that you'd change your behavior That you'd be punctual, focused, professional But my patience ends when the audience tunes out The last chance for your show is now official (DOOR SLAMS) Thanks for the compliments Thanks! How sweet of you! Sometimes life likes to play a game of cat and mouse with you There will always be someone who outplays you Thanks for the compliments Thanks! How sweet of you! Lisa, did you forget something? -Isn't it your birthday? -No, it's not. -Red roses bloom -Yet they are only a souvenir Mimosas bloom like a smile from you Autumn crocuses bloom consolingly saying to me Who gives a damn about losing occasionally? Thanks for the compliments Good luck! Thanks -How sweet of you! -Live in three, two, one, and... Welcome to Glam! LISA ON TV: ...as I visit Riccardo Macchiato at the opening of a dealership in Chemnitz and chat with him at the celebration about his new shampoo for curly hair that's not only creamy and soft, but is also formulated to help stop climate change. But what's going on with Jean-Jacques Linguetti? The Prince of Andorra's half-brother... -Happy birthday, my treasure. -...and caused quite a stir. Of course, next time here in the studio we expect a celebrity visit from the world of stars! Only here on Glam with Lisa Wartberg. And out! (BUZZER SOUNDS) You were fantastic again, gorgeous, breath-taking... -And the ratings? -They weren't. Chin up, Lisa. Relax. It will all be fine. There are more important things in life. Really? What, for example? Love. (LAUGHS) I've stopped experimenting in that area. What about the one who always calls? He still misses his wife. -And the other one? -Not enough glamour. -But what about that one... -He has a child, Fred. -A child! -A child? That's a no-go, of course. Fred, I need a drink. (YELPS) I have a date. Bad timing... I won't sit alone in front of the TV with a bottle of wine and watch repeats of my own show all night. MAN ON RADIO: That was the news in Berlin. Now it's time for our show Pop for the Heart. It's raining outside, weather that awakens a yearning to travel again. (MAN SINGING) And after dinner he said Let me just go buy some cigarettes She called out to him to take the key I'll go and check on our little girl while you're out (MARIA HUMMING ALONG) He closed the door and left without a word Into the neon-bright staircase -It stank of floor polish and smugness -(SIGHS DEEPLY) And on the stairs it dawned on him I've just got to get out of here forever -I should just take off forever -(WATER DRIPPING) Forever -(OBJECTS CLATTER) -(MARIA CRIES OUT) I've never been to New York I've never been to Hawaii Never walked through... (MONITOR BEEPING) -Where am I? -In the West Hospital. You fell. -I fell? -DOCTOR: Mmm-hmm. I can't remember. Do you know your name? Of course I do. My name is... I'm... I... What's the last thing you can remember? I remember... New York. Oh, New York. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Mom! Mom, you're alive! I was worried to death. Who are these people? Here you can see the brain injury caused by the fall, which caused her to lose her memory. -Lose it? -Forever? Some patients recover it in a few days. Others need weeks or months and some... well. What does your mother associate with New York? New York? My mother's never been further than Bremerhaven. Amnesia is like an earthquake in the head. An entire life is buried. Sometimes long-forgotten or repressed things are unearthed. -(KNOCKS ON DOOR) Doctor? -Yes. We searched everywhere. We can't find Mrs. Wartberg. I hope she hasn't strayed onto the motorway. (BOTH LAUGH) Then they gave me a lot of pills, pushed me into a weird, humming device and told me to stay put and do nothing, and I thought to myself, "Not with me!" I don't want to lie around, hooked up to things. I want to get out. See the world. Go to New York. New York? You're crazy, baby. Crazy? I can't remember that. I can't remember anything at all. DRIVER: You just gave me an idea, baby. That little cutter will bring you over the pond. Thank you...baby. (DRIVER CHUCKLES) (PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Good luck. She's about this tall. She's small. -Sixty-five years old. -Sixty-six. Sixty-six years old. Grey hair. Fred! She wears ugly, practical orthopedic shoes. I've been telling her for years they make her look older. WOMAN ON RADIO: The confused woman is 66. Her practical orthopedic shoes age her. -Truck 37-5. -Please proceed. Give me the police, baby. Stop! Help! Help, Lisa. I'm much too young and much too attractive to die. Relax! -The police will take care of everything. -The ship will be gone before they arrive. (OVER PA) Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We hope you have all settled into your cabins and are enjoying your welcome drink and the view of Hamburg harbor. We are bringing the last passengers on board. We'll set sail in a few minutes. Then it'll be full steam ahead to... MAN: Hey! What are you up to? Yes, you there. I mean you. -What are you doing? -I just wanted to go to New York. -Where the devil is your... -Ticket? In my cabin... Welcome champagne! Please forgive me! I promise you a smooth crossing from now on. Just lie back, forget the stresses and annoyances of your daily life. (ALL LAUGH) Here with us. On the Maximiliane. (BLOWS WHISTLE) (SINGING) Welcome on board I'm delighted you're here -(SCATTING) -Oh, yeah! I welcome you on our journey across the sea Oh, yeah! We're all set to sail Ship ahoy, here we go Our crew is fantastic and the service is splendid Forget high blood pressure Stresses and annoyances On the Maximiliane ALL: On the Maximiliane Booking number 8371, cabin 561. Axel Staudach and Florian Staudach. Staudach. Sharing a cabin. Coffee? -We... -I only drink hand-ground beans from... Guatemala. (CRASH) -MAN: Don't panic. -Our luggage? (SINGING) Here on board, we fulfil all your wishes Every dream comes true Every yearning satisfied Nothing can stop us No iceberg or hurricane On the Maximiliane ALL: On the Maximiliane -Excuse me. Pardon me. -Sorry! -Just a moment. What is this? -Sorry! -I'm in a rush. -A huge rush. How about an apology? -No time. -No time at all. -I must board the ship now. -FRED: Her mother... Just a moment! We were here first. -Don't you know who I am? -No. -Dad... -I'm Lisa Wartberg. -In the flesh. -So? -Don't worry, everyone will board on time. -But we have to get off on time, too. Ms. Wartberg... I don't see you on the guest list. I've been on every guest list since birth. Well. -Just a moment! -Someone stop that woman! Don't worry. We'll be off the ship in five minutes. (PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC) MAN: This is departure tradition. (SINGING) We always meet at a quarter past three Oh, yeah! And open a pastry shop on board Oh, yeah! And sound the call for an attack on the cake buffet Black Forest cake and cream meringue Fruit ice, pineapple, cherry and banana With cream on top, please ALL: With cream on top, please I have to get through for time is running out My mother is gone and the ship's about to sail Oh, no! I don't know myself My senses are melting I'm happy as a clam and I don't give a damn -There she is! -Grab her and we'll jump ship. Fruit ice, pineapple, cherry and banana With cream on top, please -Mom! -You again? The ship's about to sail. We'll go home now to celebrate my birthday, okay? With cake and stuff. I think the lady is confused. (ALL LAUGH) I have no time for explanations. (CROWD CLAMORING) What is this ruckus? Too much champagne? (ALL LAUGH) It's not what it looks like! I'm her daughter! She's my mother. -She has amnesia. -I don't recall. -LISA: Back to the clinic. -I'm going to New York. We have to get off the ship. (SHIP HORN BLOWS) -No! Don't set sail! -Lock them up until they're sober. LISA: Stop the ship! -Thank you. -Hello? Hello? Do you even know who I am? I'll sue the captain! I'll sue the cruise line! I'll sue... -Fred, who else can I sue? -I don't know. I'm calling the station now. It's a scandal! It'll be all over the evening news! You can bet on it! It's dead. -Fred, my cell phone is dead. -Really? -Give me yours right away! -The lady seems a bit unhappy, right? I'd say she's a bit stressed out. Me, stressed out? Stressed out? How so? No, no, no. A bit more would have to happen. Fred, what are you doing? Getting undressed. I'll catch my death of cold. Look on the horizon! Aren't those the White Cliffs of Dover? Oh, how pretty. And seals! How long does it take to get to New York? -A week, 10 days? -Ten days... That's it. The end. Game over. Here lies Lisa Wartberg. Once the successful presenter of her own celebrity show. First fired. Then dead. But Lisa, darling. It's so exciting. Locked up in a small, narrow cell. -On a big ship on the high seas. -With an unknown destination. -That lady is on TV? -I was on TV. Until the fateful moment that my mother destroyed my career. Oh, dear. But you still talk to your mother? Yes, sometimes. -Thank God! -Have you slept it off then? Hello! Listen, I'm a famous TV show host with a responsibility to millions, who want to see her show next week, but which they sadly, sadly won't be able to do, if I'm not back in time. So turn your liner around and take us back. And I sadly, sadly have a responsibility to get over a thousand guests to New York in five days. Oh, yes, New York! -Not helping, Mom. -I'm not your mom. -You are. -I'm not. Then sadly you're also responsible for getting sued by my station for every penny you have. You have no tickets, no cabin, no papers, no money. Under maritime law, I must hold you in this cell, declare you a stowaway, and hand you over to the NY authorities. -You cannot be serious. -I certainly am. Unless you work to repay the costs. Work your passage, as the captain says. If you exchange more than pleasantries with passengers, it's back to the cells. If you go in the pool or grand ballroom outside of your working hours, it's back to the cells. If you even think of... drinking alcohol... Let me guess! Back to the cells. Not only beautiful, but clever, too. Shift begins at 4:30. Two of you have to share a bed. (YELPS) Sweet dreams. Freddie? -Why don't you sleep with your mom? -With who? What's all this? (SCATTING) (SINGING) It was already dark When I headed homeward through suburban streets There was an inn From which the light still shone on the pavement I had time, and I was cold, and I went in (MEN SHOUTING) Dancing there were men with brown eyes and with black hair And from the jukebox Sounded music strange and southern When they saw me one stood up And bought me a drink Greek wine Is like the blood of the Earth Come, pour me one And if I then get sad it's because... I always dream of home And never alone Hey, welcome to hell! Here! Drink! You know, the work is bad, the pay is bad the food is bad, but the wine is also bad. Just drink a lot of it and you'll forget that it's bad. -Alcohol is taboo. -Not when it's stolen. The one with the tattoos winked at me. -Which one? -Mom, this isn't like you! -Maybe I'm not your mother after all. -Forgotten that you've forgotten? MARIA: The advantage of not knowing who you are... You can be who you like! Greek wine Is like the blood of the Earth Come, pour us one And if we then get sad it's because... We always dream of home You must forgive us Greek wine And the familiar old songs Pour me one more I feel the yearning once more On board this ship I'll only ever be a stranger But never alone (TIMER RINGS) (TIMER RINGS) Only four more nights till New York. You think she's as excited as us? I'm sure she is, Dad. Sleep well, sweetheart. -Goodnight, Dad. -See you in the morning. See you in the morning. Goodnight, Mom. (MARIA SCATTING SOFTLY) But the idea of having a daughter is really, really lovely. LISA: Well, that's something. So, miss, just supposing I were your mother, would I have grandchildren? No. Why not? That's a great shame. -It just never happened. -Don't you have a husband? No. Lover? -At the moment, no. -FRED: Her experiments are on hold. Not helping, Fred. I understand that, but me... Supposing I were your mother, would I have a husband? -No, you were always alone. -You must have come about somehow, missy. I was an accident. And you were very young. That's a very bad start. Supposing you were my mother, you'd have brought me up alone. -Worked for the Post Office for 48 years. -The Post Office? Yes, the Post Office. And you'd never have taken any holidays, you'd have saved everything you earned, so I'd have a better life. The Post Office. The way I feel, I think I'd have been more likely to be a bestselling author or a photo model. Something along those lines. You were a great mommy. That's worth a lot, too. Yeah, yeah. For you maybe. (RINGING) MAN: We're sinking! We're sinking... -Not. -What? -It's all just a bad dream. -Everyone up! You three are on cleaning duty. Edita, show the stowaways what real work is. -No. I mean... -Calm down, girl. You know old Dalmatian fishermen's saying? (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) If the mountain is high, the clearer the water. You understand? No. I could make good use of this guy. (ELEVATOR DINGS) Which one of the rooms should we clean? All of them. Housekeeping! How about a leather tie with my salmon jacket? Depends on the occasion. For the tactful dance lesson in the afternoon or witty chit-chat with a sundowner? Or the sensitive first contact in the morning? Try this one, so you don't get straight to the point with the ladies. Ah, James! Working here with you is really very special. -Let's grow old on this ship! -Old? -Unfortunately we already are old. -I didn't hear that. We're in the prime of life, my dear fellow. Yes! Yes, yes, yes. The prime of life! Right. Wait a minute. -(SINGING) Okay, I'm getting older -But I'll never get smart -I don't need any rules -I've got imagination -I can't tell you what is wrong -What's awry -You can only find out -If no one lectures you -I've never looked backwards -I know -And seldom ahead -Yeah -Were there any blunders? -I didn't skip those But I regret nothing For all of that time I was a good-time guy If I confess my sins to you You'll go pale So, if I can give you any advice It's this -Do everything that does you good -Does you good -Does you good -For everything that does you good -Does you good -Does you good -If water tastes bland -Drink wine -And if you want to bathe -Dive in Do everything that does you good But never alone -Breakfast? -Mmm-hmm. Hey! Close the laptop, girl. I don't want trouble. One moment. I just have to save my job. POLLY: Lisa! At last! Everyone's going bonkers and I couldn't reach you. They need next week's topics and the boss is desperate to... -Where are you? -In a hotel. -A beauty hotel. -Okay... So you won't make the meeting at 11:00? No, I won't. -So, more like tomorrow? -More like in five days. -AXEL: Nothing beats a morning swim. -Do something! FLORIAN: Something does. Sleeping in. BOTH: Housekeeping! -Yes, but we can still come in, can't we? -BOTH: No! Book me a flight from New York to Frankfurt at once for Thursday night. -I'll just make it to the show then. -You're in New York? -What is... What is going on, please? -BOTH: Nothing! Concentrate, Polly. You have to prepare the next show. First of all, invite the Russian prostitute, who Donald Trump met in Moscow. That's enough! Please open the... Please open the... Sorry. You can't go in. We're doing a...special treatment! With gas. Highly toxic gas. MARIA: Highly toxic. Step in the room, and you and your son are dead! And near the end we need something highly emotional. A blind refugee child, who was healed here. -What special treatment? -Salmonella. Cockroaches. Then call Brad Pitt, and tell him that I want him on my show. Brad Pitt? -You can do it! -Someone's inside! What? There's someone in there. Someone's in my cabin. -Concentrate, Polly. -Now... Now that's enough. Please stand aside and let me in my cabin. That's... Stop! There's gas. Think of your son. -You again! -You again! This ship has 575 cabins, and the one I end up in is yours? You said you'd leave the ship within five minutes. Yes, and I changed my mind after four minutes. I see, and then you decided to stay on board and during the crossing... to clean. Yes. She is a stowaway. Has to work her passage. That's most interesting. Yes, that's good. I've heard cleaning purifies the soul. Clever men are simply irresistible, Mr... -Professor Staudach. -Oh, Professor! Professor of what? Don't tell me. Physics? No, too exciting. Chemistry? No, no, no. Much too dangerous. Maths? Latin? Ancient Greek? Not boring enough. What's boring? I mean really, really, really dull? He's the Director of the Stochastic Institute of Darmstadt University, evaluation and description of random experiments in the field of statistics and probability. Sorry, I nodded off for a moment. No problem. He's Director of the Stochastic Institute in Darmstadt... That's enough. Shall I change the towels, too? Brad... Pitt, telephone number... -Do you like to wear skirts? -Huh? What? What about lipstick? Well, ah... Do you like to... get locked in? -Locked in? Locked in where? -Confined in a dark chest. I see, well, quite honestly, I'm not sure. Are you afraid of fire? ...and that's why I no longer go ashore in Monaco. Princess Stephanie broke his heart. Since then I have wandered aimlessly... across world's oceans. Like the Flying Dutchman. Or like Sascha Hehn. Will a woman ever be able to liberate me from the curse of loneliness? James, what do you think? Anything's possible on the high seas, Otto. Perhaps even this evening. In the grand ballroom after the buffet from 9:00. We will be expecting you, ladies, for a little dance. Exactly. Or two. Why did no one warn me that work can be so exhausting? -Is it? -Well, well... The fine lady is flagging. Even if I were still able to move, I would no longer want to move. -Goodnight, then, missy. -Yes, goodnight. We're still going to live it up, you know. What? Are you sure that's a good idea? I mean, that sounds quite tiring for... An old hag. I wouldn't put it like that, but... You probably don't remember that you're 66 years old now. And what if I am? (SINGING) You will be surprised to know That when I became forgetful I started having knees-ups And really letting rip Ah-ha... Ah-ha? Ah-ha. I'm laid-back as I blow-dry My hair that's long since grey And I pull my tummy in And act the hot chick (WHISTLING) ALL: Ah-ha! Ah-ha! If people look at me, outraged and severe I say to them "Dear friends, you take a narrow view" Sixty-six years of age, that's when life begins Sixty-six years of age, it's tremendous fun Sixty-six years of age that's when you effloresce Sixty-six years of age Is nowhere near the end What's this? Donations for Africa? No, it's lost and found. All the things that the passengers left in their cabins. Yes, yes Yes, yes I sing songs in town parks So everyone's amazed While playing on my guitar That makes a crazy sound -I doubt there's anything in my size. -Oh, there is, honey. And with the other lasses From the Golden Girls Club I will start a band up And we'll rock it to the top Sixty-six years of age, that's when life begins Sixty-six years of age, it's tremendous fun Sixty-six years of age That's when you effloresce Sixty-six years of age Is nowhere near the end (SCATTING) I really hate to bother you, but you're dancing on our table. -Sorry. -Professor Staudach! This ballroom has... Precisely 250 tables, and the one you sit at is ours. I'm certain you know the probability of this decision. I guess it was fate then. -A stroke of... -What? A stroke of fate that's called. A tragic, terrible event that one hadn't bargained on. I must say, I find it rather odd that cleaning staff are permitted to dine with us. -It's a little reward from the captain. -For the cleanest cabin. Of the day. The golden mop, so to speak. Come on, don't be so fussy. The table is big enough. We can all squeeze on. Cuddle in a huddle. Tell me, is your father a problem-child incapable of relationships, too? Don't even ask. -Good evening. -(GASPS) Good evening. -Do you want to go back to the cells? -No. I hope you're happy on board and are enjoying your evening. Excellent! Splendid! I particularly wanted to spend the evening with scrubbers. What? Scrubbers? Clubbers. The gentleman wants to spend his evening partying with real clubbers. Yes! Throw the mop in the corner and watch the lady shine with charm, not soap. (CHUCKLES) Don't I know you from somewhere? Yes, that's her problem, she has a universal face. -(BANG) -(GASPS) (MUSIC PLAYS) (EXCLAIMS) Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Costa, Magic Costa, and I'd like to introduce you to a lady friend. A very old friend. She is over 130 years young, and she's dying to meet you. Magic! What's wrong with me? I would never forget such a beautiful lady. Let me introduce my wonderful assistant, Lady Liberty! Wait, wait, I've almost got it... I need two volunteers from the audience. Anyone? Please. Anybody? Me! I'd like to do it. -And what is the beautiful lady's name? -Li... -Anna! Lianna. -Rihanna! Applause for Rihanna! If I could just... Oh, Florian! And we have our second volunteer! Me? No! No, no, no. There must be some... -Axel! -Axel. -Who will help me persuade Axel? -No, no, no! (ALL CHANTING) Axel! Axel! Axel! A round of applause for Axel and Rihanna! Axel, you are a lucky beggar. All men here dream of enjoying the chest with such a beautiful lady. MAN: Show a little more excitement, Axel! -Fred! Is that you? -Smile, Rihanna, smile. You'll be back out in a minute. Magic! (AUDIENCE GASP) I hope that your father seduces her now, good and proper. I hope so, too, but he might be a bit out of practice. I'm sure he can remember how to unclasp a bra. You are fantastic. Muah! (CHUCKLES) -I think the magic show is over. -Mmm-hmm. Back out in a minute, my eye! You're sweating. Yes. But it's not because of you. LISA: Hello! (KNOCKING) Hello! Where are you? (BAND PLAYING TANGO) My dear ladies, it's quite simple. Red is for my colleague, Otto. -I am green. -Behind the ears. No worries, though, ladies, we will not spurn the opportunity of sharing an unforgettable moment with you. Maybe even two. (ALL LAUGH) -Maria, come on, dance with me. -No. But the men here are either ancient or dead. That's true. -But don't fall in love with me. -No! Don't worry. But I must tell you something. And you mustn't laugh! -I can't promise that. -I can't remember if I can dance or not. You know, old Dalmatian saying goes... (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) What? When the storm comes, the wind is strong. -You understand? -No. Just take my hands. -Then what? -Then you will feel the rhythm. And then, Maria, then... -I'm nervous. -Then you'll be dancing. Emotion! LISA: (POUNDING) In case this is meant to be funny, it isn't! Fred! Fred! Help! My ear drums are about to burst. Fine. Then calculate a way for us to get out of here, you... -You mathematician! -Stochastician. -What's the difference? -It's simple. A stochastician calculates probability, mathematically. Help! Help! I'm getting bored to death. Would you please be quiet for a moment, so I can think about how to get out. Well? I'm waiting. Well, perhaps we should begin by breathing less, because... the finite nature of the oxygen in here is not a probability, but a fact. What? Otto, you make me feel like I'm flying. I could do this all night long. That would be wonderful. Unfortunately, other young ladies await me. I'm getting dizzy. In other words... I'll suffocate. With you? -Oh, sorry! -No problem. If we can make the chest tip that way, then, in all probability, the impact will cause the catch to be released, gravity will do its thing and we'll be free. That would require that you and I now... Move back and forth rhythmically in an attempt to make this chest tip over. Do we have to? No, we could just linger on, wait till the oxygen runs out and die an awful death. No. Let's start. -On three. -One. Two. Three. One. Sorry. Two. Three. One. Two. Three. -LISA: Did it work? -Partially. Yes. You're an unscrupulous Casanova. -What will you do if I die of jealousy? -You mustn't do that. Ahhh! -Sorry. -Jesus, Maria and Joseph. Oh, God. You really can't dance. This is incredibly embarrassing. It can't be true! Are you injured? Little Star? It was fantastic, breath-taking, exquisite. I'm shaking all over. You are a natural. Made for the big stage. Je suis Lady Liberty. -C'est moi. -Here. Take the magic wand. -What shall I do with it? -Say "magic" and put a spell on me. You? What spell? Don't think so much. Okay. Magic! Ooh! Seems I did something wrong. Try again. The start is always hard. Okay. Magic! (ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS) Merde! Stop...thinking. Magic! Maybe it isn't working. Because you've already put a spell on me. -We'll suffocate in this damn thing. -No, no. Because the stochastician blew a 50-50 chance. Calm down. Just breathe. Breathe slowly. Remember the oxygen supply. When will you finally realize? I'm claustrophobic! -I noticed. -Help! Help! -Give me your hand. Give me your hand. -What? -Shh. Give me your hand and trust me. -Like with the 50-50 chance? Breathe calmly. (BREATHES SHAKILY) Out... In... Out... In... Out... And now... close your eyes. (SINGING) Your heart is racing But just imagine you're alone Your breath becomes still It's you alone here with your dreams Your worries all vanish Like a star in the firmament Bury yourself in my arms I'll protect you as best I can Could you move your leg? You're quite heavy. Then I can get on top and you underneath. Give me your fear I'll give you hope in return Give me your night I'll give you morning in return As long as you don't lose yourself And you finally quieten down That the two of us have met again... That... I've thought of you so often. Little Star. Back there I got the impression you didn't recognize me. -What on earth are you doing on this ship? -Going to New York. (LAUGHS) Of course. Stupid question. Yes, and you? -I work...here. -You work here? As a passenger. You work as a passenger? I'm working my passage, so to speak. I prefer traveling by boat than flying. You could say I'm traveling for business. I'm going to New York to...to... to make sure everything's okay. See if the skyscrapers are still standing. You're in real estate? Uh... (EXHALES) -Yes, something like that. -Great. The summer of '71. Such a long time ago. I was doing my military service. New city. New, pretty girl. -Can you remember? Up there? -God? -No, no. The Hunchbacked Uncle. -What? We always used to secretly climb up onto the barracks roof. Yes, and we thought up our own star pictures. -Nice. Sounds crazy. -Yes, you were crazy. -And you were wild, too. -I was wild... Yes, and incredibly cute. The way you raced across the fields on your bike. With your long, blonde hair blowing in the wind. -I was blonde! -Yes, you were. 17 and... it was actually a... (SINGING) A day like any other I dream of love But unfortunately, it's just a dream People, wherever I look Big city hustle and bustle Yet all at once I saw her You Seventeen, blonde and keen There you were before my eyes Seventeen, blonde and keen How do I get to know you? (SCATTING) Would you like to dance? -No, no. -Yes, I'll show you. (SCATTING) Now you do it. Yes, let's do it once together. Be patient. One, two, three, and... Yes. Yes, you can do it! Come on. Again. So you don't forget. Two, three, and... (SCATTING) She can do it, she can do it. But that's great. Seventeen, blonde and keen There you were before my eyes Seventeen, blonde and keen How do I get to know you? BOTH: La, la, la, la, la, la BOTH: La, la, la, la, la Look, up there. Isn't that the Sick Tortoise? Yes, and next to it the Rusty Folding Bike. -The Rusty Folding Bike. -Everything can be what you want it to be. -It's so, so, so beautiful. -Yes. I have to tell you something. I can't remember anything... ...Otto, a charming ladies' man. This is my partner, business partner, in real estate. Real estate? Of course. Yes, of course. We've got some very important transactions to discuss. -See you later, Little Star. -Very important. Very. Otto... Little Star. Otto. She just didn't recognize me. And then the ship put out to sea. You know what happened next. Oh, my God. I hope your mother regains her memory. To be honest, I think she's enjoying not having a past. -What? -She seem...liberated. But how's your father coping with it? Oh, I never knew him. I'm a mistake. From a night with a chap from the circus. My mother brought me up on her own. And were you never tempted to try and find your father? It was a Russian circus. He was in town for three weeks, then disappeared back behind the Iron Curtain. No way of making contact. When I was a little girl, I always dreamed that one day he'd come to collect me. On a white elephant. (SCOFFS) At some point, it stopped mattering. It was always just us two. It was enough. A female household. I know about that. Florian and I, we're a male household. Yes. And his mom? Disappeared with the circus, too? Not exactly. She... She left us about two years ago. Left you? How mean. -Was there anyone else? -No. No one else. She is... She is... She just left. Does the boy at least see her at weekends? That's not possible. She's... much too far away. I'm sorry. -God, how long have we been in here? -No idea. At least two or three hours. -It doesn't seem that long to me. -Nor me. Fred... What do you do... in the real world? In the real world I'm a make-up artist on a TV show. In show business, too. It's a dream job. -Are you as happy as I am? -I think so. Mostly. Sometimes I wish I could magic my boss away like you did tonight. A simple trick. There is a second box which falls beneath the stage. The audience only sees the first box. Open it. Magic. It's empty. And the second box? -Beneath the stage. -And the boss? In the second box beneath the stage. Are you not listening? -And who lets her out? -The assistant. I'm so incredibly sorry, darling. You must have been scared half to death. So terrible. Yes, terrible. On top of that, stuck pressed up against that unglamorous bore for hours on end. Terrible. -Terrible. -Yes, terrible. Absolute torture. You can admit it. You can sack me. Fire me. Sue me! I should never be able to get another job in this town. Fred, it could happen to anyone. Yes, I know. She's hard work, hysterical. Arrogant and petulant. But hiding behind that mask... there's something else, something... sad and vulnerable and tender. What can I say? It confuses me. She... She confuses me. I know that this is exactly what you wanted for me, but... I couldn't even bring myself to tell her that you... that you're not here anymore, because for me... For me, you're still here. Oh, God, I'm talking to a coffee tin. How long are you going to keep looking to the past? Oh, Dad. (SINGING) The time you shared together is gone I know you feel it, too So let her go, even though you want to carry on protecting yourself Your beacon is now elsewhere And no longer with her And on the way to new happiness Listen, this is what she wishes for you She wishes you love without suffering And a hand to hold in yours She wishes you love without suffering And that you don't give up on hope And that you still have your dreams And when you look for tenderness She wishes you love without suffering And happiness for all time (SCATTING) (SCATTING ENDS) MARIA: (WHISPERING) Hey, miss. Hello? Are you asleep already? LISA: I can't sleep, Mom. That's because of your mystery professor, right? He's not that mysterious. But he was incredibly nice and caring. And clever and... -And about the same age as me. -And he's keeping you awake. What's keeping me awake is the fact that he's really not my type. He's got zero glamour. And he misses his wife. And he's got a child. You told me about your mother. How she never dared do anything, was never crazy. And was so lonely. If I were you, I wouldn't repeat that mistake. I'd throw myself in at the deep end and dare to love. Guess what? I've met someone, too. And? Well, okay. He's called Otto. And he calls me "Little Star." And he's so charming and so caring. He's so clever and about the same age as me and he's got skyscrapers in New York. Hard to believe. Little Star? He says he knows me from before. Really? Well, why would he make it up? Because he's a marriage imposter and wants to win you over. Rubbish. But the idea is wonderful, though, isn't it? What do you mean? That he made it all up to win me over. OTTO: It was as if it were yesterday. I was doing my military service and met this pretty, blonde girl. And now? Sixty, grey and no way... James, she was my first true love. I've never forgotten her. We'll use this story tomorrow during aqua aerobics. -You really are the limit. -Just a minute. May I remind you that on our cruise in the Caribbean, it was Elizabeth. On our Greenland cruise, Suzanne. -And in the Aegean... -No, this is completely different. Of course. A little colorful butterfly Softly flutters in my heart My longing sends it on a journey Whenever I sing about my dreams I see a land that's still far away Where love And tenderness reside Show me the place in the sun Where all people get along Love alone is the sun So never let love set Show me the place in the sun Where all people get along Love alone is the sun So never let love set You make my soul float With your love and magic You've magically come into my life You inspire my fantasies I seek a land that's still far away Where love And tenderness reside Come on, girl! Show me the place in the sun Where all people get along Love alone is the sun So never let love set -(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -WOMAN: Housekeeping. Yes. No! The room's already been... cleaned. Are you sure? I think that... Now that I think about it, I do believe that it has to be hoovered again. I think so, too. (CLATTERS) It's so dirty, you can't see the sea through it. Are you flirting with me, by any chance? Me? Of course not! Close contact between guests and staff is strictly forbidden. For example, you can't ask me if I'd like to... have a cocktail with you tonight. I shan't be doing that. Thank God. I need to go. I still have approximately 5,000 rooms to clean. Have a great day. That's... Lisa, that box! You must be suffering from Stockholm syndrome. Fred, just help me out here. I want to look less like... You know, Lisa Wartberg, TV star. -Who do you want to look like then? -More like her. Yes, more like me. And then I knew it'd be my hardest job yet. My dear Fred, if you happen to have time afterwards, could you help me? -Sure, Little Star. -Thanks. -You've got a date with the con artist? -Yes. What's the worst that could happen? Other than a wonderful indiscretion? MARIA: Otto? You must be mistaken. But, we arranged to meet. Yes. But I've arranged to meet with a woman who isn't as young as you. This would be way too dangerous. I've got a bad heart. I only got some highlights done. Feel this. My pulse is racing. As a matter of fact, it is elevated. Yes. You're a health risk to me. Then we should do something age-appropriate tonight. Champagne in your cabin? In my ca... bin? Here we are, madam, sir. This is your cabin? It's huge. It's a suite. And the bathroom! Champagne in the mini bar. Don't get caught. Thanks. Otto, you have two washbasins. And a spring-box bed. It's "box-spring." -And a piano! -Yes. -Can you play the piano? -No. I only play on Steinways. -Could you play something for me? -I can't. My fingers are all rusty. -Please. Please. Please! -I wouldn't want you to... -Please. Please. Please. -But it's at your own risk. Okay. -Stand over here. -Okay. -The acoustics are better from there. -Of course. Golden wallpaper and upholstered walls. Unbelievable! -(CLICKS DEVICE) -(PIANO PLAYING) (GASPS) Rusty? No, Otto. You're too good to be true. You're handsome, rich, a piano virtuoso and single. -Yes, Little Star. But there's more. -More? -I want to tell you something, but I... -Just say it. (SINGING) What I want to tell you Is just so hard I'm not quite the man I'd like to be I can't find the right words But, please, believe me My piano will tell you What I want to tell you (PIANO CONTINUES PLAYING) My piano will tell you What I want to tell you (MUSIC STOPS) -Hello. -Hello. -You look different. -I'm not wearing any makeup. Well, (CLEARS THROAT) more or less. -You look great. -Thank you. To be honest, I feel completely naked without makeup on. I like you naked. I mean... without any makeup on. I... I'm a bit scared. Of what? Of this. Yes. You know, since my wife... since my wife left... I've been hiding behind my books and my son, so no one can get close to me. I even sew leather patches onto my jackets to deter people. I'm a bit scared, too. All of the... experiments I've made in this area have ended badly. I guess that men always fell in love with the TV star and... just ran away as soon as they... got to know the real Lisa. I don't own a TV. That's wonderful. (BOTH SQUEALING) (SINGING) A word that says everything A gaze that doesn't promise But just lasts Like a new era A breath of eternity From now on with you standing here before me I will start living through you Yes, I want to, I can The moon that bows to us And shows us the way to heaven A glass full of starlight Your look that speaks volumes Once, there was a woman plagued by doubts But then she started living Through you Yes, I want to, I can -This night, with you -Just you and I -A life that I can feel -For all eternity Tonight, it's just the two of us And we're flying with angels -Paradise will become reality -Only with you -A miracle has happened -For you and me A life full of happiness There's no going back now (LISA GIGGLES) Whoo! (LAUGHS) MARIA: Wow! That was unforgettable. -OTTO: As unforgettable as in the past? -No. Far more unforgettable. Why didn't you come with me back then? We were going to conquer the world. -New York, Hawaii, San Francisco. -Were we? -Yes. And that was just the beginning. -I just couldn't dare. I waited for you at the station for hours. You never came, so I boarded the train without you. My Little Star... Oh, well. -So? Did you see the world? -Oh, yes. I've traveled a lot. From north to south. East to west. I crisscrossed all over. Yes, and then I found myself stuck in New York. And? Were you happy? Yes. I experienced some great moments. I worked at the Sunrise Diner in New York, where all the strange night birds would get their coffee. Then I was in San Francisco with all the hippies. Now, that was something. I worked as a dance teacher in Japan. Yeah. And now I'm old and I'm still traveling around. -It sounds wonderful. The great freedom. -That's one way of putting it. I have no wife, nowhere to call home and... -And I don't know where I belong. -But you've still got your skyscraper. Skyscraper? Oh, that! Yes. -Well, the thing about the real estate... -Yes, I know. -Money isn't everything. -No. -I'm on this ship, because... -Know what, Otto? If I could turn back the clock... then I'd be standing at that station. (SHIP HORN BLOWS) (YAWNS LOUDLY) -MAN: Room service. -Champagne breakfast for three, please. -It'll be there in five minutes. -Thank you. -Hi. -Hello. Are you leaving? -I have to get to work, but tell your... -I ordered croissants and fried eggs! -You're so sweet. -I'm just glad you're in our lives! Excuse me? Finally, a breath of fresh air in our small house... in Darmstadt. Good morning. Good morning. I have to... -(WHISPERS) Dad, this is the moment. -What moment? You have to show her that she's important to you. -Not just a one-night stand. -It's not that simple. I don't know what to tell her. I don't want to make a fool of myself. Every beginning is difficult I can tell how much you like her. But you can't find the right words to say Time's running out and you're not talking. (SINGING) But if I say Stay with me, I long for you It'll sound so cheesy Just try it, be straight with her -(KNOCKING ON DOOR) Room service. -Come in. Stay for breakfast Don't leave us so soon Stay until morning comes We'll surely treat you well Stay for breakfast We'll share everything we have with you And if you like being here with us then just stay Just stay I promise I won't use any patter As every word Would just be too much for you Okay. I'll stay for breakfast I won't leave you so soon And since I like being here I'll just stay But they forgot the coffee. I'll make myself useful. I can't function without coffee in the morning. -No! -No! No! No! No... I'll do it. I'll do it. -What is that? -It's nothing. That's... That's my mom. What? I'm so sorry. I... You said that... your wife left you. She did. Her dying wish was to have her ashes scattered over New York. And not... all over the damn carpet of a second-class cabin by a woman I had a holiday fling with! I think the holiday fling has to go now. Lisa. (DOOR CLOSES) (STRANGLED SOB) Where were you last night? -In paradise. -Did your back hold up? I could rip out trees! Take off your tux first. I'll iron it for you. No, that won't be necessary, James. It's completed its service. -I'll disembark in New York tomorrow. -To buy a new tuxedo? No. I... I want to see something other than this ship. I'm going to travel the world with Maria. San Francisco, Hawaii... Yes, we want to be free and leave all constraints behind. What? You're quitting? You, of all people? James... Do you really want to be standing by the pool telling old ladies risqué jokes when you're 80? And what will you live on? Oh, I forgot! You've got yourself some "real estate." All we'll need is each other. -I hope your lady sees it that way, too. -She'll understand. So she doesn't know you're here to keep the ladies company? I haven't had the heart to tell her, but... I'll tell her the truth tonight. -He didn't recognize me at first. -Maria! He said it was because I looked so young. He said I was a health risk. Isn't that romantic? (SCATTING) Is everything okay, sweetie? What? Yes! How romantic. Isn't it just? And then we went to his huge suite. You can't imagine how luxurious it was. It really was. It had a spring-box bed. Only the finest. Silk, satin, flowers... And then he played the piano and I went weak at the knees. That's strange. The Presidential Suite isn't occupied on this trip. I blew it. I shouldn't have asked her to move in with us so soon. Rubbish! It wouldn't have worked anyway. I didn't want you to be alone anymore. I'm not alone, Flo. I've got you. Mmm-hmm. Yes. -(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -EDITA: Housekeeping! -Are you sure it was here? -Oh, yes. (SPRINGS CREAKING) Maybe he's a nudist. Rubbish! He was here. He sat at this piano. And sang and played and gave a proper concert. Only for me! Uh-oh. You mean like this? (PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) Let me guess. He was a man in his prime. Always suntanned, always well-dressed. Perfect hair, and his moustache lent him a certain... something. What? You know him? (EXCLAIMS) (LAUGHS) Magic! Break. For my next trick, I'll set you on fire! Wait a moment...give me that. -I've prepared something. -You have? Okay. So at the front it's empty. Empty at the back, too. What now? A coin. Very good! You've been practicing. -And now? -Magic! I know it looks terrible and the gem's fake, but it was the only one in your size in the shop here. I can't, Fred, I... I, uh... Here onboard... it's paradise, but on land I can't. -Nobody knows... -That you're gay. Yes. I can be so on the ship, but at home it's... impossible. I'm married. My wife lives in Crete. The truth would destroy my family. We can travel together for as long as you want. You... my assistant and more... but our world is this ship. Not the world outside. Fred! Fred! CAPTAIN ON PA: Dear passengers, the end of our cruise is near. At midnight we will greet Lady Liberty personally with a drink and together take a look at the city that never sleeps. Thank you on behalf of all our crew for traveling with us. We hope you enjoyed your stay on board. Thank you for choosing Maximiliane. Goodbye, see you again! Have you seen that lady... the short one? -You must be the property mogul! -I am! -Have we met before? -Not personally. But I know your suite. And your piano playing. (SCATTING) -Maria told us so much about you. -Great! But you don't know where she is right now? Actually, we do. (BAND TUNING UP) Right. -Excuse me. -Yes? Excuse me, I'm looking for your business partner. My business partner? He'll be here any moment. -Well, I've got the number 3. -Lucky you! I've only got 8. Madam, why not organize yourself a dance card now? You won't have to wait your turn later. The red one is for Otto. Why don't the two of us... My Little Star, there you are! -I looked for you everywhere. -Me too. In your suite, at your Steinway where you played so wonderfully for me. -I'm sorry, I wanted... -No need now. Come on, Otto, work beckons! I think I'm your number one. And what was I? Number 573? No. I... I know what you... -Are you nearly ready? -Yes. Go ahead and take him. But Maria, I... Finally. (SINGING) Illusions blossom in the summer wind Put forth buds so fine but ephemeral If experience plucks them on your way They'll quickly wilt Illusions blossom in reality To the dance of your youth The first breath of sorrow Will blow them away Yet as long as people can still dream A dream of theirs Will no doubt one day Come true Illusions... You fooled yourself For the person you once loved is laughing at you now And the castle in the sky you built Collapses in a single night And then you ask yourself why must that be? But life alone tells you the answer Over time when your summer years have passed You'll understand ALL: Illusions blossom in reality To the dance of your youth The first breath of sorrow Will blow them away Yet as long as people can still dream A dream of theirs Will no doubt one day Come true (SHIP HORN BLOWS) CAPTAIN ON PA: On the port side you'll see the Statue of Liberty. This wonderful, strong woman was a present from the French people to the USA that was inaugurated in 1886. In her right hand she holds the torch of liberty, in her left the Declaration of Independence. At a height of 46 meters, it is one of the highest statues in the world. On the starboard side, southern Manhattan with its legendary skyline. New York. Your final destination. Do you know what's strange? These past few days I knew only one thing... that I'd never been here. I clung to this single, puzzling memory. And I thought, as soon as I was here I'd know why I wanted to come. But nothing's happened. There's nothing here. Or here. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Mom, I'll take you home tomorrow. (SNIFFLES) (CELL PHONE RINGING) My phone! My phone! My phone. (GASPS) 321 messages! And Brad Pitt! -How did you get them all to come? -You said I could do it and I did! There she is, my favorite presenter! How on earth did you manage it? Hmm? But now get yourself back here! I urgently need to take you to a terribly expensive restaurant to talk about your terribly well-paid future. (VOMITING) Fred! Fred! We're back! We're back on! (TEARFULLY) I know, Maria. Don't cry just about love. There's an old Dalmatian saying... (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Excuse me, I choked on the saying. What good is squid tomorrow, when octopus is fresh? Think about it. LISA: Best get three outfits for me to choose from. No, make it five! Nothing must go wrong this time! Yes, I'll prepare my questions to Brad on the flight back. And Fred will think of something very special this time! Hollywood film-style. I want to look like a screen goddess. Angelina Jolie will be green with envy. Right, Fred? -No problem. Same as always. -No. Bigger, more glamorous. Aren't you listening? What's the matter? I'm lovesick, damn it! My heart hurts, my tummy hurts, I feel sick. But you don't give a damn! I thought you were my friend. But actually, you're just my boss. (SIGHS) I'll call you right back. CAPTAIN ON PA: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome on board We'll be on our way to Frankfurt shortly. I thought Costa was the one, I was sure. Till death us do part. And now it's over. Finito. Welcome to the club! But darling, you know. Fall down, get up, straighten your crown. There are plenty other fish... Mom, what's the matter? Little Star. (SINGING) I've never been to New York I've never been to Hawaii Never walked through San Francisco In ripped jeans -Mama? -That song! That song! I've never been to New York I've never been to Hawaii That was always our song. We dreamed of the big wide world. We didn't want to end up living a narrow, bourgeois life. -What are you on about? -Your father and me of course. But you couldn't know. It was before you were born, my precious one! I've never been to New York I was never really free -You've remembered, Mom! -Yes, everything! You and me. Our life. Our little apartment and more. I've never been to New York I've never been to Hawaii I've never walked through San Francisco in ripped jeans I've never been to New York I was never really free -We have to get out of here. -What? Yes, we must get off and get on the ship. Find Otto! -BOTH: The gigolo? -Your father! CAPTAIN: Please sit down, all passengers. -My fa... -I have to get off! MARIA (SINGING) La, la, la, la... My father! -Calm down, please! -What are you doing, Mother? -Mom, what's going on? -I don't want to miss out again. -Oh, no. Let me through. -It's really serious. -I need to get off. -Stop the plane! Sit down, please! We only abort take-offs in medical emergencies. That's what it is. My mother is seriously ill. She's probably having her third heart attack. Have you got chest pains again, Mom? Heart attack! CAPTAIN: Please return to your seats! -(GROANING) -Help! Help! (SHIP HORN BLOWS) What have Prince Philip and I got in common? We've both ridden on Queen Elizabeth! Don't leave all the work to me. Queen Elizabeth II will always be first for me... -I know what I want. -Pardon? (SINGING) I want to feel her When the morning breaks -You're still thinking about her! -Spend the day with her into the night You're a hopeless case. And not think there's an end in sight No, not for us Give me your drink. A gigolo in love is no use to anyone. Now go! Hmm? Go and get the love of your life back. I know what I want I want the passion with which you love me The gentle tenderness that you show to me The illusion that you live only for me That's what I need I know what I want I want something new to finally start That we are one mind and one body That is my goal Tell me one thing Is that too much? -Are you getting your man back, too? -Yes, sort of. Get a move on! (SHIP HORN BLOWS) Take care. Good luck! I know what I want To show you everything that I've ever seen To forgive and understand anything you do What I've never done before in my life I will start now COSTA: To the airport, quick. DRIVER: All right. I'll do my best! LISA: I'm not going to throw my arms around him in tears just because 45 years ago you were too daft to use contraceptives. Speed up, you can make that traffic light. FRED: Just try to relax, Lisa. No problem. I've only lost my show and my mother's told me a gigolo's my procreator. Take the highway! Why don't you take the highway? Why don't you drive yourself? (LISA HUFFS) (SINGING) I know what I want I want you around me always Whatever's in the way I shall just change I've never moved mountains before in life but I will from now on! Stop that ship! Stop that...ship! My memory's only just returned, but the ship's gone. It's just not to be. -Fred, what is the ship's next port? -The Bahamas, I think. Let's take the next flight then. Dad won't get away that quickly. What? Procreator's such a stupid word. The next flight to the Bahamas? Just a moment, I'll take a look. (SINGING) I know what I want The lady on the phone wants me to know, too. We've to get to Germany quickly. One moment... So, I'm back. -Have you ever been to Germany? -Only Majorca. We need three tickets to The Bahamas. Two. I don't want to come. Are you sure? Darling, go for it. It's super you're going after him, but there's nobody for me on the ship. (SIGHS) AXEL: Your mom always wanted to visit New York. (KISSES) (SNIFFLES) Now she'll be here forever. (SINGING) Merci, merci, merci For the hours, chérie, chérie, chérie Our love was so beautiful So beautiful, merci, chérie Don't be sad if I have to leave you Adieu, adieu, adieu! -Your tears... -Oh, man, Dad, that's enough! Flo... No... What... Her biggest wish was for you to be happy again quickly. For you to allow someone new into your life. Then, someone comes along and you slam the door shut and say you're grieving. (HORN HONKS) MARIA: You can't begin to imagine how in love I was. Otto... Otto was so handsome. Especially in his uniform. And even better without it. I only realized I was pregnant once he'd gone. Two weeks later. So you made up the story about the Russian circus. Otto wasn't even 20. He wanted to see the world. He wanted to get away, whatever the cost. What do you think would have happened if I'd said, "You're going to be a dad. Get a job and let's find a nice flat to live in"? It would never have worked. You can never really know that beforehand. Forgive me. -In 12 hours we'll be on The Bahamas, Mom. -Say "mom" again. Mom. That sounds so good. You know what, precious? When happiness comes along, you mustn't let it pass, you have to seize it. Okay, if it ever does again... I'll grab it tight, I promise. Bye. Does the hotel have a TV? Yes, there are lots of districts. There's Brooklyn... It's still there... Sunrise Diner. When I first came to New York 40 years ago, I worked as a waiter here. -It's open all night? -Yes! We can kill time there until our flight tomorrow. Amazing! (CLEARS THROAT) Joshua? Yeah, take a seat. Be with you in a minute. Get outta here! Hey! -You look so old. -Well, I can't believe you're still alive! (BOTH LAUGH UPROARIOUSLY) (SIREN BLARING) (PHONE RINGING) WOMAN ON PHONE: Good morning. This is your wake-up call. Taxi! Taxi! I'm just getting a coffee. I won't survive the journey otherwise. (HORN HONKS) Can I get a double decaf, please, and a... No. Can I get a coffee, please, regular. -MAN: With milk and sugar? -Black. Yes, ma'am. What are you doing here? (GASPS) (GASPS) Are you okay? -Are you all right? -Oh, God. -Can I help... -Lisa, you'll miss your flight. -Otto! -Little Star! (LAUGHS) What are you doing here? I quit the ship and now I'm helping Joshua with the coffee here until I fly to Germany later to find you. We were about to fly to the Bahamas to find you. -I've missed you so much! -Me too! (SINGING) If I hear a song, any song we both knew I still think how great it was We were happy, it then dawns on me Because you were there And if anyone ever tells you that I forgot Then remember this I believe in tomorrow For some time or other we'll meet again Time and time again, the sun rises And the new day always brings us light Time and time again, the sun rises And darkness never lasts forever It never lasts It never lasts Otto, I have to tell you something. You see that woman? She's called Lisa and she's... If a leaf, any leaf falls from the tree Because the autumn wind causes it to When fate robs us of something... -Otto, I must tell you something! -...just trust in time... (CHEERING STOPS) (INAUDIBLE) I'm a father... I was a father... Nonsense. I... I am a father! Yes! I'm a father! I'm a father! (ALL CHEERING) (CLEARS THROAT) Fred? I was just dreaming about you. Magic! Do you... Do you still have the ring? It's at the bottom of the Atlantic. I see. No problem. I... I'll magic it back up. -How did you do that? -It's quite simple. Recognize your mistake, go to the on-board shop, buy another ring. And give it to the man of your dreams. Oh! Lisa, what would you do if that guy with leather patches were outside? -LISA: Nothing. -Embrace him? Give him another chance? -No. -So it doesn't matter he's in that taxi? -About to drive away? -What? The Empire State Building, then Times Square. Lunch in Chinatown, then Ellis Island... Florian, how about we see how the mood takes us, hmm? -Empire State Building, please. -Perfect. Let's go. -But he's pining for his wife. -Lisa, run! -Zero glamour! -Run. -He has a kid, guys! -Lisa, run! -Run! -I've never run after a man. There's a first time for everything. Stop that taxi! Stop! Stop that taxi! Stop that taxi! Stop that taxi! Stop! Stop! -Jesus, that crazy woman again. -(GASPS) I don't believe it. -Maybe she's out for a jog. -Dad. -Or she missed the bus. -Dad! Or she's on her way to a sale. Man, Dad! BOTH: Stop the fucking car! All right! (PANTING) What are you doing? I... I just like chasing... after taxis. New York has eight million inhabitants. The likelihood that the two of us would meet here again... is as small as the likelihood... that a holiday fling would forgive a complete idiot with leather patches for being too cowardly to tell her he's a widower. As small as the likelihood that... an emotionally complex TV presenter would want to be with a widowed stochastician from... Darmstadt. That small? Roughly, yes. Ready to embark on something new? Ready. Oi! Do you want to go to the Empire State Building? Yes or no? I think all plans have changed. (SINGING) With the love light in our eyes We'll accept no compromise We'll take happiness where we find it We'll all live in our own way And we won't be a cliché We won't put on an act We'll do what we like and like what we do This is our motto, for young and old Today's the first day Of the rest of your life It's now or never, not sometime or other Life is a dream That one day will be real The future begins today -(CELL PHONE RINGING) -Oh! (BRAKES SCREECH AND HORN HONKS) Hello? No, I won't make it to the studio today. If I have to choose between missing the show or missing my life... Let me think about it... Let my assistant present the show. She's young, attractive, name of Polly At least, I call her that. Her real name is Sabine. Let's go! Today's the first day of the rest of our lives It's now or never Not sometime or other Life is a dream That one day will be real The future begins today In New York? I don't know how you picture your futures. Mom? Dad? My dearest Fred and his fiancé. -Axel? Florian? -And you? I'd like it to be a future which we're all a part of. Who are you? Just joking. Here's to the future! The future! I've never been to New York I've never been without a patch I've never walked through Darmstadt in ripped jeans I've never been so honest with myself I've only worked my passage once It's good to do what you've never done! I've never been to Paris I've never been outside the US I never do anything but go to work each day Mi scusi. I've never been to Rome I have never felt at home It's good to do What you've never done -MAN: On air in three minutes. -Don't let the mic crackle again. Or you'll be delivering pizzas tomorrow. The light should be warm and soft. Not like at the gynae... Where is my "Polly"? And my double decaf hazelnut cinnamon? Thank you so much for coming, Mr. Pitt. You can call me Brad, Sabine. You can call me...Polly... Brad. (THUMPS) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! -Hi, Joe, Merry Christmas. -Thanks, Bob. -How's the baby? -Oh, everybody's great. -Have a good one. -Thanks. Again? Those crazy Germans! (MAN SINGING) The time we shared together is gone I know you feel it, too WOMAN: So I'll go now, even though you want to carry on protecting me MAN: Your beacon is now elsewhere WOMAN: And no longer here with me MAN: And on the way to your own light WOMAN: Come on, say what you wish for me BOTH: I wish you love without suffering And a hand to hold in yours I wish you love without suffering And that you never give up on hope And that you still have your dreams And when you look for tenderness I wish you love without suffering And happiness for all time (BOTH SCATTING) WOMAN: You stay behind And you remain firmly in your world MAN: Well But it's still good when someone Crosses their fingers for me, too WOMAN: So I say "ciao" But please look back Just once over your shoulder And smile at me and tell me now What do you wish for me? BOTH: I wish you love without suffering And a hand to hold in yours I wish you love without suffering And that you don't give up on hope And that you still have your dreams And when you look for tenderness I wish you love without suffering And happiness for all time (BOTH SCATTING) MAN: A day like any other I dream of love But unfortunately, it's just a dream People, wherever I look Big city hustle and bustle Yet all at once I saw her You Seventeen, blonde and keen There you were before my eyes Seventeen, blonde and keen How do I get to know you? Seventeen, blonde and keen There you were before my eyes Seventeen, blonde and keen How do I get to know you? BOTH: La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
