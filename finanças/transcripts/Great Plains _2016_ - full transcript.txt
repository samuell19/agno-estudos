It makes me feel like Everything is gonna be all right It makes me feel like Everything is gonna Be all right When I’m with you When I’m with you I’ve got a wooden box That’s full with the stack of letters I didn’t send I remember the light Shining in your eyes When the fire light’s gone down Our backs against the ground Staring at infinite sky It makes me feel like Everything is gonna be all right It makes me feel like Everything is gonna be all right It makes me feel like Everything is gonna be all right When I’m with you When I’m with you I should have swallowed my pride A little easier, but I wasn’t strong enough Now you’re gone Your magic’s still in my soul I don’t know what to do Am I still in love with you? How will I know? What the fuck? Kipp? Jesus Christ, Kipp. What are you doin’? I told you to find something to eat. Come on, let’s go. What is this? No, put that back. You know, you really ought to put those magazines somewhere kids can’t see 'em. - I’ll take just the chips. Thank you. There you go, sweetheart. Come on, let’s go. Okay. Come on, let’s go. I’m gonna get you a dog. Isn’t this fun? Look at this place. Don’t you feel lucky? Come on, Kipp. Go knock on the front door, okay? Go on. Go knock. Boo! I got you, didn’t I? Come on in. I’m gonna go get... make you something to eat. Here you go, Kipper. Come on, sit over here. Come on, sweetheart. I made you a sandwich. Sit right here. I’m just gonna go take a quick look around. I’ll be right back. Good boy. I got ’em. Come on, boy. Oh. Who are you? What the hell are you doing in my house? Sorry. We couldn’t wait, and he was hungry. I had a mind that was your truck down the road. Yep, that’s me. I ran out of gas. Luckily, you’re close by. Lucky me. I wanted you to meet my boy, and he wanted to meet you. Well, good, ’cause I ain't giving you a red cent. You still owe me from last time. That’s not what this is about, I swear. What’s your name? Oh, you’re looking at my bear. That’s the last damn face that bear ever made. It happened right out there in the backyard. The dogs started barking and carrying on, and I looked up from the sink and there he was, surrounded by all three of them dogs clawing and scratching at him. Before I could get my gun, he had already took out poor old Daisy and Petey. I felled him right there. One blast to the chest. Blam! So, you remember that. Don’t mess with my dogs. You wanna touch it? Well, he’s a regular Chatty Cathy, ain’t he? He’s had a rough time lately. Mm. That cowboy of yours do that? Why you ain’t never had enough sense to pick a good one, had ya? Your picker’s broken. You want some ice cream? Okay. Sure. Well, that broke the levee. Tell me your name, I’ll go fix you some. -Kipp. -Kipp. Well, Kipp, have a seat, and I’ll go fix it for ya. Uh-uh. I’ll do it myself. Might have seemed fit to call. I just... I don’t know. I figured it’d be better if we just showed up. I mean, if I called, you’d just say no. Oh, well, you got that right. Here. Meet me in the parlor. Feel free to turn on the TV. I did. All channels are black and white. Well, I wouldn’t know. Colorblind. That’s very rare for a woman. Yeah. Well, I am a very rare woman. Dichromasy or Monochromasy? -What’d you say? -Two kinds of colorblindness. They’re both hereditary. -Hm. -You know? No, I did not know. How’d you get so smart? How you know all that stuff? You got it too? I’m not sure. Couldn’t know if I do. Now why would you say a thing like that? Well, some scientists say colorblindness could be an evolutionary advantage. Lots of animals are colorblind. Especially predators. And bears? No, bears can see in color. Not anymore. You like that butter pecan, huh? Yup. Just like your mama. She used to come home straight through that front door, head right to the deep freeze, and eat her way clean through all my favorite flavors. Don’t eat too much, honey! You’ll spoil your appetite! We staying for supper? Would you like to stay? Do you want to? Mm. He certainly likes you. That’s the most he’s spoken in months. Mm. Well, let’s see. Last time I saw or heard from you was, what... seven, eight years ago? Looks like that money you stole from me you didn’t use it for what it was you said you was gonna do. No, I didn’t. And thank the good Lord. He’s my little man. He’s my angel. Sorry I took that money from ya. I really am. I just... I just knew you wouldn’t lend it to me for that, and I had nowhere else to go. How do you know what I would’ve done? I’m a woman. I watch "The View." Where’s his daddy? His real daddy. What was his name? Chip? Chuck? Chet. Chet. Last I heard, he was holed up drunk and high in that same shithole trailer we used to live in. And the one who done all that to you? No. I know what you’re thinkin', Tess. Tommy is different. He was good, and he is good. He’s really good when he’s not drinkin'. Yeah, I saw that big ol’ diamond ring on your finger. He loves me, and he loves Kipp. He insisted on adopting Kipp right after we got married. Chet didn’t even put up a fight. Then one day out of the blue, Tommy just smacks you a good one on his way to feed the homeless. That what happened, Murel? Hm? And the boy? Does his new daddy beat him? No. Hell no. I’d kill him if he ever laid a hand on him. What’s the police say about all this? They don’t see me as nothing but a kooky bird. So where you gonna go? Hell, I just wanna go somewhere there’s a crowd I can get lost in. Hm. What is this? The sun. - Oh, yeah? It’s like... somewhere. From California. And what’s this? A seashell from California. We’re invading the picture. -We’re invading the picture. -That’s the beach. Good. I don’t even know what a mussel is though. When we get to California, we’ll go find one. How about we put this stuff up now? No. Put your ship in. -Okay. -There you go. I’m a little bit nervous about the earthquakes. They say it isn’t if, it’s when, you know. Oh. Well... don’t you worry, baby boy. We’ll get us a house on roller skates, and when the big one comes, we’ll just roll all around. Sweetheart, Kipp... has Daddy ever hit you? No, Mama. Why? Good. Eskimo kiss? So, till... jellyfish walk and turtles fly, unicorns fart and eat booger pies, till gators drive cars and dolphins take flight, I love you, I love you -till morning. Good night. -I love... morning. Good night. Oh! What was that? What the heck? Was that your tongue? Gross! Ew! Ew! - Yuck! Inappropriate! You don’t do that with your mom. It’s gross, okay? You save that for your girlfriend when you’re... 30. Ah, ah, ah. Good night. And no more with that tongue. Bleck. Good night. I love you. Hey. Where the hell you been? You just up and disappeared. You beat the hell out of me again, Tommy. What’d you expect? I didn’t mean it. Can I help it if I’m passionate? I just got carried away in the heat of the moment. Yeah? You say that every time. What? Don’t be all dramatic now. I said I didn’t mean it. Come on home, baby. Tommy, have you ever hit Kipp? Tommy? Tommy, are you still there? It was an accident, Murel. We were boxing. I was... showing him how to protect himself. He didn’t duck when I told him to. Tommy. I’m trying to teach him how to be a man, Murel. You’re always babying him. I knew you’d overreact. That’s why I told him not to tell you. You gotta tell me this stuff. There can’t be secrets between us. I know, baby. I’m sorry. Tell Kipp I’m sorry too. If he comes home, I’ll get him that puppy he’s been wantin'. A golden retriever, a lab, pit bull, whatever he wants. I got you somethin’ too, baby. You did? Somethin’ sexy. Give me that phone! You listen to me. You stay away from her and don’t you ever come near her or that boy again, do you hear me? Do you hear me? Turn this damn thing off. - Who is it? Randall? Sorry to wake you, Tess. What the hell do you want so early? Can I come in? I guess so. I wasn’t asleep. I was making coffee. You want some? Yeah, coffee’d be great. Thanks. So you know anything about a broke down Ford Extended Cab out on Highway 81? Good grief. Every other car in Oklahoma is a pickup. Is that how come you came pounding on my door at the crack of dawn? Well, this one here, it belongs to a man over in Cashion. We got a... got an Amber Alert out on it. A child abduction. Child abduction? Yeah. A mama... took her son and run off. Her own son? Since when is that child abduction? It sounds more like a weekend getaway from a no good husband to me. Who is that? Yeah, that’s my new partner, Conley. She’s just up from the city. Hm. Yeah, New York City. Well, Officer Conley, welcome to my home. Wake up, baby. Wake up. Wake up. Shh! That would be my husband, Bob. I expect you’ve heard a lot about him from Randall and anybody else in town. He was the sheriff here for 35 years. Hang on there. I hadn’t even gotten my bed made yet. You got no right to go up there! Randall, this is illegal. Not if we’re in pursuit, Tess. Pursuit? The plates on the truck, they belong to Murel. Lord, if I had a dollar for every time I had to haul that girl’s butt back here drunk or worse... Hmph. Thought maybe she had settled down a bit after she had her boy. Hell, maybe she will yet. Conley! Let’s pack it up! Tess, I ran the plates myself but it’s only gonna be a matter of time till my young go-getter cohort out there runs ’em too. If you talk to her, you best tell her she needs to get herself on home and turn herself in ’cause it's only gonna get worse if she don’t. Thanks for the coffee. Hey, you know I’m gonna have to impound the truck until the owner comes for it. -A convertible! -Remember this beauty? Oh, my God, I can’t believe you still have this car! God! Oh, my gosh! -Love you. -Love you. Here, take this. Don’t look at it. Just take it. Oh... -It’s what was left in the jar. -Tess! You’re gonna need it a whole lot more than me. -Thank you, Aunt Tess. -Get out of here. And... and stay off that damn phone or get yourself a new one! And let me know when you get to California. Write me a postcard! None of them goddamn e-mails. And if I hear that you’ve gone back to that damn son of a bitch, I’m gonna black your other eye myself. You hear me? Love you. Hey, Kipper, you like this car? Oh, yeah! What color is it? Red! No, wait! Green! -No! -Blue! Blue! That’s right! Bye, Aunt Tess! Bye! Be careful! Bye! Whoo-hoo! So now I’m a kidnapper, huh? What the hell, Tommy? He’s my son! He’s both ours now, remember? And I never called you a kidnapper. Well, the police are. That’s one hell of a way to get me to reconsider comin’ back home. This is the third time you’ve taken my boy, and this time, you stole my truck. What the hell you expect me to do? You should have kept this between you and me. Come on home, baby. We can straighten all of this out. I’ll tell 'em you ain’t no kidnapper. I won’t make it without you two. No, don’t do that. Don’t try and make me feel sorry for you. It’s the same shit you always pull. I can’t anymore. Do you hear me? I can’t anymore. -Listen to me. -The hitting, the lies... They will find you and they will arrest you if you don’t come home. Come home now, and I’ll make sure you don’t go to jail. Jail? That’s exactly what will happen if you keep going. Tommy, you wouldn’t. Mom! Mom, look! Wait till you see what I got us. Check it out! It’s for the dashboard. She wiggles her butt when you hit a bump. -See, Mama? -Close the door, baby. Close the door. That’s great, baby. See? It’s funny. She wiggles her butt. Mom? I think you’re going the wrong way. I got no choice. We have to go back to your dad. Kipp, I love you. I don’t expect you to understand. Turn around! Put your seatbelt on! Stop! Stop! - Kipp, stop! Kipp! Kipp! Kipp, stop before you hurt... stop it! Stop! Stop. Calm down. I don’t understand. What is wrong? Kip, why did you run away? -He, uh... -Look at me. -He... -Sweetheart, talk to me. What is wrong? -He... -What? Kipp. Sweetie, tell me. I can’t hear you. What? At night time... -What? -...he comes to my room... closes the door, and makes me watch him... He makes you watch what? ...until I can’t keep my eyes open. Baby, I don’t understand. What are you saying? He doesn’t wear clothes mostly, but... What? ...then he closes my door. What did you just say? I’m sorry. Oh, my God. I’m sorry. It’s okay. It’s okay. You're okay. It’s okay, sweetheart. It’s okay. Baby, it’s all right. It’s okay. It’s okay. It’s okay. It’s okay. Shh. You’re okay. Kipp? Kipp! Kipp! Kipp! Kipp, where are you? Oh, Kipp! Kipp! Kipp! Oh, my God. Baby, you about scared me half to death. Here. Let me show you. Give me one of those. -We’re skippin', huh? -Echo. -Echo. -Echo. Echo! Echo! I love you, Kipp! I love you too, Mama! How much? Ten thousand million percent and a million! I love you too! I love you to the moon and back, though! Me too! Got it all mapped out? Yeah, I think so. All back roads? Yeah, but I think we can still be in L.A. in just a couple days. Everything’s filled with the same thing Maybe slowly drowning I was hanging on the edge of a shot glass Mom? Till the night was... Your Great-Uncle Bob was a sheriff, and sheriffs use guns. -And outlaws. -No. But listen to me. You and me are on the right side of the law. The police are wrong this time. I know what they said, but they’re wrong! They’re all wrong! The cops, the TV, the law, everybody. You hear me? Yeah. That’s her, all right. He was such a cute boy. Polite. Kidnapping. Damn. I sure hope he’s all right. She mention anything to you about where they might be headed? No. Oh. Yeah, wait. The boy. He said something about California. He wanted oysters. Here in Watonga. Listen to me. You stay here until I come get you, okay? -Got it. -Great. Oh, fuck me. I didn’t come for that. Damn. You still hurtin’? Damn straight. Can barely get into bed these days. Damn VA doctors won’t up my meds. My therapist’s fuckin' useless. Rhonna around? This look like Rhonna’s around? You look good, Murel. You still with that... Prince of Plaster -or whatever he goes by? -Duke of Drywall. Not anymore. Oh. Good. How long you had that? Couple months. One too many DUIs. -Surprised. -Thanks for reminding. Time for a change. Damn thing smells the alcohol in your sweat. - Unlessin’ you're clever. Eh? Eh? Still don’t keep me from doing a mean two-step. Eh? I just met you - And I wanna go Something clicking Surely I know I wanna call you again and again I wanna show you off to my friends I wanna buy you a ring Make you sing I wanna write you a song -Oh, my God. Are you okay? -Ah, shit. -God damn. -Oh, my God. Kipp, I told you to wait in the car. Aren’t you hot in that suit? No. It’s seersucker. I got it from Dillard’s. The... the tie is from Sheplers. I used to wear ties from Sheplers. And I got every fancy pair of boots I own there. Why don’t you wear them anymore? Well... It’s hard to get around this... fancy ankle bracelet of mine. May I use the bathroom? Yeah. It’s around the corner. The door don’t close. That’s all right. What are you doing over here for anyway? Huh? What do you want from me? I’m in a deep heap of shit. Me and Kipp are both in a heap of shit. What, police after you? Oh. Well, you can’t stay here. Police cruise two or three times through here a day just to check on me. Somebody just needs to tell ’em the truth, tell ’em what happened, then they’ll see and let me go. Nobody’s gonna believe me right now. What the hell you talkin’ about? What Tommy did to our kid. He messed with him. Messed with him? What does that mean? I knew it. I knew that fucker was no good. Shouldn’t have never married him. This is your own doing. -You got yourself into this... -Fuck you! -This has nothing to do with me. -Why did I ever think that you might actually help? I knew you’d say somethin’ like this. You’re gonna have to deal with this yourself. I already have enough problems of my own. Okay? Get out of here before the police get here. We had our family reunion. Now go on. Get out of here. Get! Don’t come back! Shit. Hey! Hey! What are you doin’? Hey! Stop! What? What are you doing? That’s my car! Hey! God damn it! My car! Police! Open up! What the hell? Oh, man. It’s about damn time. I ain’t done nothing wrong. You got anybody else staying here with you, son? No. What can you tell me about this car out here? Bitch stole mine. At least she left me hers. So, she was here, your wife Murel? -Raped him. -Excuse me? Asshole husband of hers raped... raped him. Fucker raped my boy. Try this again, son. Look at me now. How do you know this man hurt your son? She told me. You have reason to believe that she’s telling you the truth? Yeah. She’s a good girl. One thing Murel ain’t... is a liar. You know, I reckon we ought to call child services over this latest issue. He’s a crazy meth-head looking for sympathy. You don’t really believe him. Hell, I don’t know. But it could not hurt to look into the adoptive father. I did. Nothing more than traffic infractions and a DUI that got tossed. Kiwanis Club, Little League coach, church man. Well, I’ve known plenty of church men with lots of secrets. Kipp, come here. Turn around. Yep. Perfect. Be still like a statue. Don’t move. I love you, my little mummy. And again, today is the third day... -Hey. -Hi. I’ll take a room. Okay. Just fill that out there for me. So you... you travelin’ all alone... -Betty? -Uh-huh. Just for the night? Uh-huh. That’s right. Cash okay? Uh, yeah. As long as it ain’t rubber. Sorry, that was a horrible joke. Um, I could... I could probably get you the honeymoon suite for the same price. -Big round bed. -No thanks. Jacuzzi. And it comes with a free bottle of champagne. -Yeah? -It was supposed to be just for the married couple, but I could probably rustle you up one. No thanks. That won’t be necessary. I’ll take a regular room. Suit yourself. All right, it’s gonna be number 205. And I’ll... I'll see ya to your room. I’ll be fine, thanks. 205? -Yeah, it’s... -Thank you. -It... no, it would be my pleasure. -No, no. Really, no. Not necessary. I... I seriously don’t mind at all. I just painted it. I... I know you’re gonna like it. I got you, baby. I’m about to take you out, okay? Here, I’ll help you with that big one. Oh, no, that won’t be necessary. -No, it’s okay. I don't mind. -No, no. Really, it’s okay. I’ll give you a little hand here. -Okay. -I got it. It’s okay. It’s okay. Yeah. There you go. Okay. Dang, this is kinda heavy. Yup. It’s heavy. What do you got in here, a body? Wow. Yeah. Listen, it’s heavy, but be careful! Be careful with that! A body. Listen, it’s heavy, but I’m used to it. No, it’s cool. It is heavy, but I... I got it. -I got it. Here we go. -Please be careful. I’ll be careful, I’ll be careful. We got it. -Oh. -Yeah, but it is kinda heavy though, yeah. -Oh, easy. -No, it’s all right. I got it, I got it. -Okay. -I may be a little jiggly now, but I threw shot put at Shawnee High, okay? -Oh. -I’m stronger than I look. -Be careful. -I was All-State three years straight. -Okay. -Just a few more steps. -Please be careful. -I got it. I’m being careful. -Here we go. Here we go. -Easy. Easy. Okay. - Five. Whew, that new paint smell, it’s like a punch in the face. Just leave the door open. It’ll air out or you'll get used to it. -One or the other. -I got it from here. Thanks. All right, here we go. Oh. -Oh, my God! -Oh, gosh, Betty. -I hope I didn’t break nothing in there. -It’s okay. Thank you. -I got it. -I’m really sorry. Just go. It’s, uh, the name's Wade. I’ll be over there in the office till midnight -if you need anything. -Thank you, Wayne. Good night. Just close the door on your way out, please. Wade. Wade, with... with a "D." Thank you, Wade. Good night. Okay. I’m sorry. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Are you okay? Baby, are you okay? Asshole. What an idiot! Oh, God. Get up here. Asshole! Yes. He’s a real a-hole. Although, I don’t want you using that word. I’m hungry! Well, I saw a Denny’s down the road. I am not getting back in that bag tonight. Okay, fine. Fine. I can understand that. I saw a bar next door. What if I just go over there and see if they got some food too? Okay, stay here and watch TV. I’ll be right back. Do not open for anybody and don’t leave the room, you got it? Good. Lock this door. Lock it. Baby. Milkshake! Chocolate! -Shh! -No! Strawberry! Goodness. Sing along If I could write you a song With Jesus -Oh, excuse me. Sorry. - Oh Excuse me, can I get a menu? -Sure. -And a beer. Thanks. Well, thank you very much. This next little number, the one I wrote, I’d like to dedicate to the... the pretty lady from Oklahoma City who just walked through the door. Look at all the roads I’ve taken Some of them even left me shaking Battered and... But I made it on through You always Home Thank you. Hey, can I buy you a beer? No, thank you. I already got one. Yeah, well, let’s get you another one before that one gets warm. Honestly, thank you, but I can’t. I left my son in the room. Beautiful heart Beautiful soul You know what? You can have my beer. Thanks. Well, now, hold on a second. Where are you going? Are you kidding me? The second I said the word "son," your face turned 16 shades of white. No offense. It ain’t the first time I’ve seen a man get all pasty at the mention of a kid. You got a kid. Do you got a husband too? Take it all in stride This crazy ride we’re on Mm, a long story. Well, your food ain’t come yet. Lose my breath Just like the day we met -One beer. -Just one beer. -Fair? -That’s fair. Okay. Cheers. My love for you will never change Do you sing here all the time? Yeah. When I ain’t workin’ the grill. Well, you got a nice voice. Well, thank you. You like my songs? The one I heard was great. -Well, thank you very much. -Thank you. -Thanks for the dedication. -Yeah. Beautiful heart How come you think I’m from Oklahoma City? I don’t know. You just got that... that air. -That air? -Yeah. What does that mean, "that air"? -I’m full of air? -No! I don’t mean it bad. I just mean that you... you seem so experienced. Oh, thanks a lot. Jeez. I ain’t that old. No, no, that’s not what I mean at all. I just... oh, God. I’ve got a bad case of foot-in-mouth disease, I’m sorry. Can I try again? You’re already two for three. Man. Listen, I’m not from Oklahoma City. I’m just a small-town girl from Choctaw. Oh. Thank you. Well, uh, thanks for the beer. -Yeah. -And the music. Uh, you staying at The Glancy? I finish my last set at 11:00. Can I stop by and see you? You’re sweet, but, uh... we got an early start in the mornin’. Beautiful Me and the kid. Okay. I’m getting better, see? I didn’t turn all white that time. -Nice. -Yeah. They had chicken fried steak. Kipp? Kipp? Kipp? What are you doing under the bed? By the way, that guy came back. What guy? The jerk who dropped me on my head. Did he see you? No. I hid under here. Okay, good. Oh, you know what, sweetheart? I think he just wanted to bring us something nice. Guess what I brought for you? Are you hungry? Hey. So I brought you that honeymoon suite champagne even though you ain’t in the honeymoon suite. Yes. Thank you so much. -That was so sweet of you. -Yeah. You know, I just thought that maybe... maybe you and me -could enjoy it. -Oh, no. Thank you. I’m just... gonna turn in. Come on. C... couldn’t you use a little company? A pretty gal like you... all alone. No, no. Really, I’m so tired. I’m just gonna hit the hay. You are... alone, aren’t you? Good night, Wade. I can explain! -Please don’t... Kipp! -Come on! Kipp! Ow! Kipp! - Let go of me! No! Kipp! Kipp! Kipp! No. No. No! Listen to me. You have to listen to me. Not that man. You can’t let him take him. No! Please! - That’s her. Yeah, crazy lady carried her boy around in a bag! -No! -In a bag! He touched my son. He molested my son. You can’t let him take him. Baby! It’s gonna be okay, baby! Don’t you do this. Don’t you fucking do this. Stop it! No! What’s wrong with you? I told you what I’d do and told her. Didn’t I tell you? Kipp, you all right, son? Shh. It’s okay. She’s gone. She can’t hurt you no more. He’s fine. Scared. Tired. I’m just glad he's safe. Please. Please, you’ve got to help me. You’ve got to help me! Please! Please! I’m begging you! Please! Not him! You can’t let him go with him. Now you don’t have a mama. What do think about that, you little shit? You’ve got to help me! This is not right! -You’ve gotta listen to me. -Who’s gonna tuck you in now? I gotta get my boy back. Come on. Sit down. Hon, I can’t get you out of here. Not right now. They’ve got you on what they call a 48-hour mental health hold. What d... what do you mean? Tommy told the court that he’s afraid you’d hurt yourself, so they invoked a hold. He can’t do that! -Yeah. -How did he do that? Yeah, they can. It’s the law. This is not about the law, Randall. This is about a mother’s rights to protect her kid. This is about my right to protect my kid. Randall, please, you’ve got to get me out of here. So, truthfully now... how long has this been goin’ on, what Tommy’s doing to Kipp? Uh... I don’t... I don't know. But even if it’s only happened once or twice, it can never happen again. It can’t ever happen again. Tommy could do all kinds of terrible things to Kipp in 48 hours. You think about that, Randall. You think about that. 48 hours. Two days. Behave yourself. You locked up the wrong person, Randall. You locked up the wrong person! You locked up the wrong person! That was awful. Wow, you look like you was rode hard and put away wet. Hey. Okay. You posted my bail? How? Well, never you mind. Just don’t go jumpin' it, okay? Where’s Kipp? Oh, honey, he’s at Tommy's. Well, I gotta see him. Let’s go see him. Can you take me there? He’s got a restraining order against ya. He can’t do that. He’s my son. 500 feet from both of ’em till this thing goes to trial. No. No! The hell with that! I’m sorry, no law gonna keep me away from my boy. -No! -Tess! Not here, okay? Let’s just go to Tommy's. If you take me over to Tommy’s, we’ll work it out. I’ll get my purse out... When Randall told me, I nearly got my shotgun and went after that dumb son of a bitch myself! We’re both working on getting somebody to look into it for us, but it is like tryin’ to braid live eels in a bucket. I don’t get it. The law is more on the side of the monsters than the children. I’ll take care of it. No, don’t you go getting in any deeper than you already are. Randall and I will find somebody who can help us. No, I said I’ll take care of it. Well, look who it is. The hell you doing here, Murel? You know I could have you arrested. I just want it the way it was. I want my family back. A little late for that, sugar. We’ve already got lawyers and judges involved. Don’t, Tommy. It ain’t about the law. It’s about us. It’s about our family. It’s about you, me, and Kipp. I’m sure we can make all that other crap go away if you just let me back in. Now, come on. If you really meant what you said, we can work it out. Baby, come on. I’m tired. I want my boy back. And you. That is crazy. How do I know you won’t run off with him again first chance you get? No. I’m done runnin'. I swear. Come on. Just let me back in. Please let me back in. I’ll be good, I promise. ’Bout time you come to your senses. I was beginning to think you had completely lost your mind. This is where you belong, baby. You, me, and Kipp. That’s all there is. I know. I don’t know what I was thinkin’. You tell your mama what kind of dog you gonna get? He wanted one of them froufrou dogs at first. I told him that’s no kind of dog for a man. But he’s okay with that now. Ain’t ya, kid? You okay with that, Mama? Yeah. Sounds great. Jimmy Pulley got a new litter of Dobie puppies. He’s gonna give me one cheap... ’cause he still owes me for fixing his boat. They’s purebreed. Usually cost two or three grand. -Each. -That right? I got you somethin’ too, baby. Remember I told you? Aww. What is it? Open it. I gotta get supper on the table. Just open it. Oh. It’s so pretty. I expect a private fashion show right after supper. Damn, this is tasty, Murley. At least your mama’s good for somethin’, huh, Kipp? Mmm. Give him a couple of these. What are they? It’s just something the doctor gave me to calm him down some. You should’ve seen him a couple days ago. Out of fucking control. All right, sweetheart. Be a good boy and take these. Drink up. Attaboy. Don’t forget to eat all the rest of your salad. Do what your mama tells you. What are you doing, Mama? Just what I gotta do. Don’t you worry about nothin’, baby. Mama’s gonna take care of everything. You just get some rest, all right? Till jellyfish walk and turtles fly, unicorns fart and eat booger pies, till gators drive cars and dolphins take flight, I love you, I love you till morning. Good night. You and me against the world, Kipper. I love you, Mama. I love you too, baby. More than life itself. You remember that always, all right? Good night. Damn, girl. What took you so long? I need you, darlin’. Welcome home, baby. Welcome home, baby. Tommy’s a good boy. Tell me please. You’re... you're a good boy. Wait. Baby, hold on. Tommy, no... ah! Tommy! Stop. Tommy, wait. Tommy... Tommy, please. Wait. Tommy, stop. Get me another drink, baby. I need another drink. Wake up, baby. Wake up. I can’t see. I know, baby. Come on. I’ll help. Wait, let me get my suitcase. No. We’re gonna leave it. Come on. Let’s go. Come on. Crazy bitch. - I should’ve known better. Tommy, stop. Just let us go. We’ll never bother you again. Well, now, you fixin’ to kill me too? Get out of here. Get out. Kipp, go. Go outside. Mama will be right there. Oh, please. You gonna shoot me? You ain’t got the balls. Just set it down. Just set it down, Murel. You’ll just make things worse on yourself. Police would have a field day with you and that gun. You just diggin’ that grave deeper and deeper. Good girl. Just set it down. We’ll pretend this never happened. You fuckin’ shot me! You crazy bitch. You know the deep shit you’re in now? You shot me! You crazy bitch. And you’re never gonna see your kid again. Never. Just keep talkin’, Tommy. Please. Give me an excuse to put the next one through your head. The bitch shot me. Arrest her. Arrest her! Get out of here. -Go on now. -You can’t let her go. Come on. It makes me feel like Everything is gonna be all right It makes me feel like Everything is gonna be all right It makes me feel like Everything is gonna be all right When I’m with you When I’m with you I’ve got a wooden box It’s full with the stack of letters I didn’t send I remember the light Shining in your eyes When the fire light’s gone down Our backs against the ground Staring at infinite sky It makes me feel like Everything is gonna be all right It makes me feel like Everything is gonna be all right It makes me feel like Everything is gonna be all right When I’m with you When I’m with you I should have swallowed my pride A little easier But I wasn’t strong enough Now you’re gone Your magic’s still in my soul I don’t know what to do Am I still in love with you? How will I know if I don’t try? How will I know if I don’t try?
