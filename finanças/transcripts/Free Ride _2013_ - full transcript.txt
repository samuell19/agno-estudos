GIRL, NARRATING: Gas, grass or ass. Nobody rides for free. At least that's what my mom says. (Dog barking) GIRL: Please go away! (Woman crying) (Woman screaming) (Man grunting) GIRL: Don't you fucking touch her! Don't you fucking touch her! Mom! (Woman screaming) Mom! (Indistinct shouting) Mom! CHRISTINA: Sandy? It's Chris. (Whispering): I got to get the girls out of here. He almost killed me tonight. SANDY, OVER PHONE: Calm down. Go pack yourself up. Come over here. Really? Really. Yeah, for sure. You got to get out of there. (Sniffling) (School bell ringing) Going to the ring tonight? Yeah. Cool. Everyone's going. Meet me outside. I want to show you something. Okay. TEACHER: Class, your homework assignment for tomorrow is chapter 5, questions 1, 2, 3. And then after you're done with that you can start on your next assignment, which will be chapter 10, one through seven... (Giggling) Is there something funny that you'd like to share with the class? (Children laughing) (School bell ringing) Hurry up. You got me in trouble, you dodo bird. You're the dodo bird. Come on. Hey! What's going on? We're going to Florida. Here. So that your eyes don't burn out from all the sunshine. Come on, get in, get in. Cool! (Car doors closing) Come on, get in. I'm going to need a co-pilot. I'll be damned if I'm going to take any lame asses across state line. We either do this together or not at all. SHELL: I'm not a lame ass. Why are we going to Florida? I called Sandy. She said she could get me a job. It's as simple as that. Does Grandma know? I'll tell her when we get there. I need to get down there and make some money first. I'm not going to sit here and listen to her tell me what a fucking loser I am for having to move us back into her house. Is that okay with you? You're either in or you're out. Travelin' 77 south. (Car engine starting) â™ª â™ª There's a house of cards â™ª And it's coming down â™ª There's a beating of a drum â™ª â™ª But it makes no sound â™ª There's a howling wind but the trees ain't swaying â™ª â™ª There's a hidden truth in the words you're not saying â™ª â™ª It's a better way â™ª And the way is out CHRISTINA: Lock your doors. We wouldn't want some trucker crawling in here looking for a warm bed full of ladies. Yeah, sure you wouldn't. Good night, John-Boy. It's not going to be forever. What if it sucks? Then we'll go back to Grandma's. Is it just going to be the three of us? Just the three of us. You promise? Yeah, I promise. Good night, John-Boy. Good night, Elizabeth. Good night, Mary Ellen. â™ª Shine on â™ª Every broken mile â™ª Smile on â™ª Your little ones â™ª Rise out â™ª Of another southern sky â™ª On your little ones â™ª Shine on your little ones â™ª On your little ones (All chattering excitedly) CHRISTINA: Okay, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Let me park the car first. Sandy! Hey, girls. Whoa, Nellie, don't spill my beer. (Laughing) Come on. Welcome to Florida, baby. Sandy! Aah! But the cleaning part is just for now. The boss man has other stuff coming up, but you're going to have to meet him before that happens. Do you think he's going to like me? He's going to love you. Why? Well, you're good-looking, for one. What does that have to do with cleaning houses? It doesn't. But it matters. (Objects crashing) (Man and woman arguing loudly) MAN: What's wrong with you?! Come back here, Shauna! SHELL: I don't know why you didn't just ask her if you could have it. I don't want her to think I'm so charity case, that's why. Where did you get that? What? The gum in your mouth. Um... back there. Back where? In the store. We didn't buy any gum, Shell. Well, I couldn't hold it, so I put it in my pocket and I forgot it was there. Spit it out. Spit it out. Okay, we're going to go back, and you're going to tell the store lady you stole it. She'll probably make you give something back. Why?! Because we're not trash, Shell. We don't steal. I didn't mean to. Okay, but you did. Come on. This sucks. Sorry, bud. SHELL: Let's all eat. (Car horn honking) Let's make some pasta. All right, wish me luck. For what? Cleaning? Good luck! Thank you, Shell. She'll like living here. I'm going to get the food. (Rock music playing over car stereo) (Engine revving) â™ª It's too late to turn back Is that a fucking orange tree? WOMAN: Uh-huh. They call it the Venice of America. (Laughing) Can I get one of those? â™ª This is strange â™ª Tonight WOMAN: Are you afraid of birds? CHRISTINA: No. Good. They're good security. What? (Bird squawking) Wow. Are you fucking kidding me? PARROT: Hello. Hello. Hello. All right, nobody's here. All you got to do is dust the place. You'll find everything you need in the kitchen. All right. Pick you up at noon. Cool? All right. Sure. (Laughing) Hey, guys. PARROT: Hello. Hello. (Car door closing) â™ª (Birds squawking and chirping) (Knocking at door) Hi. Sign here. Oh, I'm just the cleaning lady. Yeah, yeah. Sign it anyway. PARROT: Hello. Later. Later. Hey. What's up, mi amiga? Hmm? What are you doing down here, Sandy? (Laughing) Working. Yeah, but doing what? You know, same shit I was doing in Ohio, just bigger. Jeez, Chris, it's just pot. How much bigger? Can't say. Sorry, chica. Mum's the word. Says who? The boss man. That's just the way he does it. All right, look. Cleaning's the first rung. After that, if he likes your work then you can do the fun stuff. And if not, well, then let's just say you got to find yourself a new line of work. Oh, yeah? Like what? I don't know. Got a nice ass. Maybe a little go-go dancing. if you think I'm going back to that shit. (Laughing) All right, all right. Let me try and work some magic. â™ª â™ª SANDY: Thanks for coming so quick. Come here. All right, now the fun starts. So this dude Ray, this hot dude, he's going to ask you for change in a white pickup truck. And I just hand it to him? That's it. All right. Are you sure you're all right doing this? Because this is the last stop, Chris. Okay. He's going to be expecting my car. Take it. (Rock music playing over radio) Wow, Sandy. Either you got better-looking or I'm about to meet the new girl boss man's been talking about. You better not let Sandy hear you say that. It'll be our little secret. How do you know I can keep one? Just a feeling. You got some change for me? Look, if you ever need a tour guide or anything, my hourly rate is pretty reasonable. (Laughing) Ray. So I guess the position of the tour guide is taken. Nah. I just like to get first names. Part of my redneck upbringing. In that case... I'll show you around the Everglades. You, uh... You might recognize some family members there. (Laughing) Well, now I'm definitely not calling. (Music playing over transistor radio) Oh, what a day, huh? So you, uh, you live here? Yeah. By yourself? I wish. (Laughing) Ah, the parents, huh? I get it. Yeah, my mom. So, what's, uh... what's your mom do? She cleans. (Wolf whistling) PARROT: Hello. Relax, sister. It's the moment of truth. Yeah? Mm-hm. Boss man's having his birthday party tonight, and he would be delighted to meet you. Cool. Look good. What? This isn't working for you? (Laughing) But I smell so good. CHRISTINA: You know, you might want to try staying inside the lines. Okay. â™ª What's the word, perm? Hey. Really? Come on. Look at you. Seriously? I look good. (Engine starting) Look, don't spend it all in one place, and make sure Shell gets something to eat that isn't sugar, all right? You look nice, by the way. Thank you. Get your shoes on. (Indistinct chattering) Miss Ohio. Mm-mm. I'm glad you could finally grace us with your presence. And this is, well, we like to call him the Captain. Hi. Christina. Pleasure. I heard some kind of rumour about being able to eat off the kitchen floor at the bird house. Wasn't like that when Sandy was at it. Come on. You know where my skills lie, hmm? So, uh, where did you two meet? We danced together at this place called Ember's Tomb. Oh, boy. Lunch shift. What a shithole. (Laughing) You work in the houses? Yeah. Not for long. CAPTAIN: Yeah, of course. SANDY: Come on, follow me. I want to show you something. Nice to meet you. Would you like to dance? Sure. I've heard some real good things about you, Christina. You must be the boss man. Evening. Hey, got a cigarette? Sure. Your dad know you out here? No. He doesn't care. Chris. Zada. I'm upstairs if you ever need anything. Thanks. Hey. I hope your ass is free tonight. Why? What's up? We're celebrating. Fucking what, already? Your first trip out. Really? When? Boss man wants you on the water ASAP. Apparently you got potential. Cool. All right, first things first. The rules. Follow me. One: no sampling the load. Two: never, ever throw a load. And three: no relationships inside the organization. The boss man does not like the right hand knowing what the left hand's doing. Comprende? What? I'm not fucking around here, Chris. You got to pay attention. I'm here for you, Sandy. Whatever you need. All right. First thing we got to do is find a boat. How about that one? Too big. We're looking for a 30- to 40-foot fishing boat. Anything bigger draws too much attention. Anything smaller doesn't have enough storage. All right, Chris. Let's see what you got. This guy's cool. Anyone aboard? Can I help you? Hi. Uh, I was wondering if you rent your boat. Sure do, but I won't be around to run it. I've got some relatives in town. You got to start thinking like a sailor. So you only want to buy food that keeps, because you never know how long you're going to be out there. You want canned, dry, pickled, smoked, but only the good stuff. Look, Chris, we're moving drugs, not rockets. Just be good at your job, and look good doing it. My, oh, my. Must be destiny. You know Ray, the Captain. And this is Duane. He's the best fisherman in Florida. You make good coffee? I've been told. RAY: Well, you better, because we got a hot date in the morning with this charmer, and you don't want to see him behind the wheel when Sandy's making coffee. (Snorting) This is my new friend. Rain. You want some? (Erotic rock music playing) â™ª Here I go falling down, down, down â™ª â™ª My mind is a blank â™ª My head is spinning around and around â™ª â™ª As I go deep into the funnel of love â™ª â™ª It's such a crazy, crazy feeling â™ª â™ª I get weak in the knees â™ª My poor old head is reeling â™ª â™ª As I go deep into the funnel of love â™ª â™ª I tried and I tried to run and hide â™ª â™ª Even tried to run away â™ª You just can't run from the funnel of love â™ª What do the stars say, captain? Are we in trouble? Sure looks that way. How long are you going to be gone? A couple of days. Hey. I didn't think you guys were going to make it. (Chuckling) Hey, beautiful. What kind of bait you using? I'm not. Well, you got to offer the fish something, darling. I thought it was just supposed to look like we're out here fishing. I mean, it is, you know? But we might as well see what Poseidon has to offer while we're doing it, right? Let's see what we got here. All right. Okay. Actually, you know what? It's bad luck to have someone bait your hook. Come here. Come here. You know, I never took you for the squeamish type. I'm not. It's just I've never used something so big. You give me a minnow and I'm all over it. Well, it's the same principle. You're going to want to get it on there nice and secure, and leave just enough dangle to get their attention. Flip that switch. Come on, we got the mothership. RAY: Think you got this, Miss Ohio? Don't you worry about cops? No. International waters. CHRISTINA: Where does it go from here? RAY: Inland. You know, the boss's houses, where we hold it until it's picked up and goes north. (Knocking at door) Get your shit packed, girls. Hey. Hmm. Get up. â™ª Well? Come on. It's all yours. Oh, wow. (Laughing) (Indistinct chattering) CHRISTINA: All right. I think I can handle this. (Playing notes) (Laughing) No, no, no, no. Let me show you how it's done. Okay. All right. (Playing) (Laughing) All right. Told you. (Snickering) No way. Come here. (Making kissing sounds) Hi. (Laughing) Hi. Hi. Hi, bud. What's your name? SHELL: Sandy told Mommy it's a gift from the boss man. What if he doesn't like us? Then we'll... We'll run away on the horse and call Grandma to come get us. Can we do that? Yeah. Grandma said I'm an adult now, and I can leave whenever I want. I mean take the horse. She said it was a gift, right? Yeah. Then it's ours. (Engine sputtering distantly) (Vehicle approaching) (Engine shuts off) Mom? Turn the light off. Come here. CHRISTINA: Do you want to keep the horse? Then you got to be cool, MJ. Boss man's storing some stuff in there, and we need to be cool about it. No one but me, you or Shell goes inside the barn. You understand? Yeah. Good. Because I'd like us to stay put for a while. â™ª SHELL: You look stupid. Mom says it makes me look smart. Pancakes! And... fresh-squeezed Florida orange juice for my two lucky ladies. Why are we lucky? Because I took the day off so I could make you breakfast and drive you to your first day of school. But the bus comes right to the driveway. I know, but I thought it would be a nice treat. But it comes right to the driveway. And I want to watch my two girls walk into that school with all those other rich kids. No, but I want to ride the bus. Why are you giving me such a hard time about this, MJ? Because I don't want to be dropped off like a little kid. I want to ride the bus. CHRISTINA: Remember, baby, you're the smartest girl here. (School bell ringing) So? It's so cool. They have a treasure box in class that only the good girls get to see. And I already have a best friend, named Megan. Great. So? It's okay. She has a boyfriend. What? I do not. Really? Who? The boy down the street. Wait, no, no. And he's not. His locker is next to mine. Jeez, spaz. Hey! Hey, hey. Enough, enough. All right, I got to show you guys something. Whoa. Holy shit. Hey, watch your mouth. Okay, here's how it goes. That's for Bugsy. That's not. â™ª RAY: Mm, that smells like homecoming. (Captain chuckling) Oh, yeah. And I'm thinking of having some homecoming dinner over at Duke's joint tonight. You want to join me? Well, as long as he's still got his mom chained to the stove, absolutely. (Captain laughing) Shit. What? They're stranded. CHRISTINA: How can you tell? CAPTAIN: The flare. Shit. Is everything covered? Uh, mostly. But we didn't get everything underneath. CHRISTINA: Can't we just turn around and pretend like we didn't see them? No. It's illegal to leave the scene of a vessel in distress. And they saw us. Coast Guard. Fuck me. Hello! Hey, there. What's the trouble? COAST GUARD OFFICER: We've been taking on water. Can you transfer us to port? Of course. Come onboard. COAST GUARD OFFICER: This is one beautiful skiff. (Sighing) A container, huh? All those cargo ships must have created a debris field on the way out. I will be making a thorough and detailed report once we get back to dry land. Work or pleasure? Both. I'm working... (Laughing) ...they are pleasuring. It's a honeymoon job. COAST GUARD OFFICER: Oh, I see. I've been on a few of those myself. Gentlemen, would you care to join me on the bridge? I got a nip of 12-year-old scotch I can't wait to break into. COAST GUARD OFFICER: No, sir. We are still on duty. Although a cup of joe always seems to calm my nerves. Of course. Ray, would you mind making the officer a cup of coffee? Oh, no, no. I don't want to bother your hires. I know my way around a galley. Oh, no, no. Come on, Captain. Tell him. He wants my cup of coffee. I mean, anything for the coastguard. CAPTAIN: Christina, would you mind bringing it up to the bridge when it's ready? Of course. Hey. COAST GUARD OFFICER: You. You have mahogany? That was fucking crazy, man. I mean, those sea scouts were on our fucking boat. That's your cut. It won't bite you. Sure it won't. (Shell shrieking) They're biting me! Come here! (Gasping) Where were you? (Gasping and panting) Up, up. Arms up. Arms up. I leave you for one day. You kidding me? It's okay. (Whimpering) Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Hey, hey. Shh. Look at me. It's okay. (Shushing) â™ª SANDY: Two more shots. He is hung like a fucking horse. Hey, how do you feel? A little nervous. Good. Terry, this is my girl, Chris. Nice to meet you, Girl Chris. Nice to meet you, Boy Terry. Well, as a great fisherman once said, better is the end of a thing when it's beginning. I have no idea what the fuck you just said. No one does till they're at the end. (Speaking foreign language) Mom? (Indistinct murmuring) Hey, what's going on? Sandy didn't show. Neither did the Captain. What do you mean didn't show? They left. They're not coming back. Hey. You must be the hired help. I'm the Big Kahuna, but my friends call me BK. (Phone line ringing) RAY: Hello? CHRISTINA: Ray, what's going on? RAY: I don't know. Captain grabbed Sandy late last night and skipped town. The boss man's pissed. So just lay low for a bit. CHRISTINA: Yeah. Okay. â™ª (Indistinct chattering) (All laughing) What's going on? Shit. What are you doing up? You're back. CHRISTINA: Go back to bed, baby. (Snickering) We're still going to the beach in the morning, right? CHRISTINA: Yeah, everything's cool. Just go back to bed. Anyway... (All laughing drunkenly) (Laughing): Oh, God! You're fucking crazy! RAIN: Not very exciting, but if I had to pick one, if it was the last day on planet Earth, I'd pick ABBA over the Bee Gee's. MJ: Everybody but you. RAIN: Are you kidding me? They're the hottest shit right now. Really far out. Like, right now there's no current-- Nobody sounds like that. MJ: Okay, yeah but-- No, but the others are legends. Innovational. Innovational. Who's a legend? (Laughing): You're out of your-- You've lost your mind. SHELL: He's a jerk. I hate him. You don't even know him. He never says hi. And all he does is just look at your boobs. Would you like to go on the slide, Mr. Doodles? Oh, yes. I would love to go on the slide. Yeah, I love... Are you fucking kidding me, MJ? MJ! You get back here! MJ! You want to fuck up everything we got going here?! MJ: Why does it matter? Because I told you no one goes in there. So fucking what? So fucking what?! So fucking what?! Who the fuck do you think you are? Do you understand what you could have done? (Shell screaming) Stop hurting her! (Panting) Get off me. Get out of my room! Jesus, I hate you! Get out! Shell, get out! (Panting) Now! I'm leaving. You think you can stick around, or are you planning on prowling the neighbourhood? We should have never left Ohio. Because I don't want you ruining your life with the shithead next door? Because Grandma took care of Shell and I didn't have to. Don't worry about taking care of your sister. I'll find someone who's thankful to have a roof over their head and doesn't mind a little responsibility in return. I'm disappointed, MJ. Stop acting like it was so fucking great at your grandma's. (Crickets chirping) SHELL: Why do some look bigger than others? MJ: I don't know. Why are some brighter? Maybe they were born that way. Why? God wanted it that way, I guess. I don't think so. I think they were all born bright, and then after a while, all the stuff around them, dust and stuff, covered them up. So you just can't see them. But they're still bright underneath. It's still there if you look close enough. That's why you're going to be the doctor and I'm going to ride horses. (Indistinct chattering) MAN: Who the fuck is that? (Chain rattling) You need a job? (Phone ringing) Hello? Yeah, yeah. No problem. Okay. I have to leave for a few days. Zada, you can take the reins from here? All right, give me a kiss. Can we go to the beach when you get back? MJ really wants to. No, I don't. Yes, she does. Sure. All right, I'll call you when I get back. Okay. Bye, girls. MJ: I'm already going to the beach. SHELL: How? MJ: Don't worry about it. WOMAN: But you got nice colours. I'm so white. I know. No, but it's beautiful. It's nice. (Squawking) (Engine rumbling) You got to be fucking kidding me. What happened? He just hit a fucking sandbar. Hey, I usually don't come in this way, all right? It's low tide and we're loaded. Push! Push! ...three, push! (Grunting loudly) Fuck... Oh! I think it moved a little. (All straining) Oh! (All groaning) And a push! Push! (Gasping) Fuck! Come on. Fuck it. Fucker! Fuck! DUANE: It's just too heavy, man. Tell me something I don't fucking know, Duane! CHRISTINA: Push! Come on! Oh! (All squawking) We're sitting ducks. We just wait for the tide and we'll be fine. We're throwing it. We are not throwing load. Radio the boss man. He wants me to go down for him and there's no fucking way. Let me just think for a minute. There's no fucking time to think, man! The sun is up! The cops are going to be crawling on my fucking boat! I don't owe the boss man nothing. So grab a bale and get the fuck over the rail here. I'm not touching it. (Water splashing) (Water splashing) We have a problem. (Door opening and closing) Did you know that the study of human behaviour first began with the study of animals? Darwin discovered that animals exhibit patterns of behaviour based on survival and natural selection. And once you control the variables, those behaviours also can be limited, manipulated. In theory, if an animal is taken care of, nurtured, fed... it will exhibit behaviour that can be predicted. But every so often a random gene enters the mix and changes the direction of the group. And it has to be extracted. before the entire herd can duplicate the pattern. Boss, I did not throw that load. I swear to God. You tell me exactly what happened. The rules exist for a reason, Christina. But I'm sure you already understand that. Dollar a pound. Your cut, plus BK and Duane's. They won't be needing theirs. It pays to be more intelligent than an animal. CHRISTINA: Terry? TERRY: I'll be right out. NEWSWOMAN, OVER TV: ...The impact felt all throughout the community. Tonight, the district attorney is saying it was all surrounding one thing: drugs. Nicole Jacobs with new information. What do you have, Nicole? NICOLE: The bodies of two men, Duane Hoffman and Brian Klay III were just discovered lifeless in front of the Ocean View Hotel. The circumstances surrounding this incident are still under investigation. What can I do you for, beautiful? Whisky and water. (Breathing heavily) (Crying) Girls? MJ, put the magazine down. I love you very much. You know that, don't you? If anything were to ever happen-- What's going to happen to you? Nothing's going to happen to me. Nothing's going to happen. I just... I just want to make sure that you know what to do... if anything ever did. I know you're big girls now, but if something does... I want you to call your grandma so she can come get you, okay? What's going to happen, Mom? Nothing's going to happen. (Sniffling) Okay. You're going to need a larger boat than usual. Big enough to fit six tonnes. Wow. New group. Get someone else to handle it. No, I can handle it. Good. You wanted to make an impression. I figured I could trust you to do that. I'll take care of it. (Doorbell ringing) (Knocking on door) CHRISTINA: Hey! RAIN: Hey. Guess who's going out tonight? CHRISTINA: I have no idea. RAIN: We are. CHRISTINA: No, we're not. RAIN: Wait, wait. No, no. Please. Please, please, please, please, please. It took me some real bo-jo to get these tickets. Get what? Tickets to Blue Comet Cowboys. CHRISTINA: Hey, man, I got to work. I mean, maybe if you had given me a little notice. Can't you skip? No. Wait, I'll go. Absolutely not. Wait, why not? Because. Because why? I finished off my homework. It's a school night. We wouldn't be late, would we, Rain? Nope, not too late. MJ: See? Mom, we won't be late. Please. CHRISTINA: I don't have time for this. It's my first concert. What do you want me to say? Yes. Please. Fine. Oh, my God. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Rain, I'm coming! Looking good. Right. Now, since I know these dudes, we're going to be going backstage and shit. All right? So you got to be cool. Copasetic? Totally. All right. (Keys jingling) You ready? Yeah. Okay. â™ª Will cause tyrants to tremble â™ª â™ª Or sink at our guns like the Cumberland's crew â™ª That's not a bad song. Mm-mm. You know, I thought we would try something a little more civilized tonight. Well, isn't that nice. Yeah. Beautiful. And I bet it tastes good too. Smells good. (Rock music playing over radio) Can I have some? Okay. (Sniffing) (Coughing) (Rain laughing) Hola, chica. CHRISTINA: Hi. CÃ³mo estÃ¡s? How are you? Good, good. You got something for me? Yes. The yacht behind us. It's coming. Ah, gracias. Nothing like a cold beer on a hot day. I know, right? Salud. (Laughing) Cheers. Mm. So, does boss man-- Where does he have you stay? In Lauderdale. Ah. You live by the beach. No. Our holding house is at the canal. Ah. The big ones. Mm-hm. (Laughing) He really knows how to take care of his girls. Yes, he does. MAN: "My fate cannot be mastered. "Only collaborated. "Nor am I the captain of my soul. Just its noisiest passenger." (Laughing) Aldous Huxley. Good, good, good, good, good. All right. "Sometimes we do what we have to do to do what we want to do." Who said that? Christina Milland. Hear, hear. Hear, hear.

Going to rain tomorrow. How do you know? Ring around the moon, rain soon. See the light reflecting off the cirrostratus in front of the moon? It's associated with warm fronts and moisture. You learn something new every day. You can certainly try. How about a nightcap? Nah, too much work. Got a load tomorrow. All right. Good night. Good night. â™ª I'm not lovesick, I'm not dead â™ª (Rock music playing) (Inaudible) (Crowd cheering) You know, we could leave. There's three of me. It's not that simple. Nothing good ever is. I'm in, Chris. You just tell me when. (Phone ringing) TERRY: Hello. Hey, Ray. Yeah? You got a call. Says he's the boss man. (Car door slamming) I meant what I said. Be careful. I don't want you disappearing on me. Come here. I'm not going anywhere. (Engine starting) SECURITY GUARD: Stop tripping, lady. You're the one that needs to start tripping, man. Hey, because when I tell Joey, your ass is grass. SECURITY GUARD: He doesn't even know who you are, lady. That's bullshit. Dude, that's bullshit. I gave that guy the best head of his fucking life. What are you doing? No! Get the... Hey. What the fuck, dude? Hey. RAIN (Laughing): What? What the fuck are you looking at? What the fuck are you looking at you stupid, dumb bitch? What, do you think you're so fucking cool? What is she doing in there? SECURITY GUARD: She was invited. now get your skanky ass out of here before I throw it out. Get the fuck out here! Get the fuck out here, MJ! MJ: Why not?! Why not? You said that you knew them. Because, MJ. Because why would he want me, huh? He could get a fucking 15-year-old to suck his fucking cock! Wait, no-- Get in the car! Wait, I wouldn't do that, Rain. (Indistinct chattering over walkie-talkie) (Police radio squawking) (Parrot squawking) PARROT: Hello. (Door banging) Get the fuck off! We don't do that shit here. Get her out of here! Go! You need to get the fuck out of here. Yeah. Get your ass up and go. You're not moving fast enough. Fuck you, you fucking... Open the fucking door. Open the fucking door! (Car horns honking) (Busy signal buzzing) (Rain sobbing) RAIN: No one loves me. Nobody loves me. You stupid fucking whore. (Mumbling) Shut up! You stupid, fucking bitch. You worthless piece of shit. Please, please. Would you mind giving me a ride when you get done? Been calling the house. Slow down. Please, God, slow down. Shut the fuck up you stupid, fucking whore! Rain, please. Shut up, shut up, shut up! Please! Shut the fuck up! Help. Please, somebody help. Somebody help me! Somebody help me! (Car horn honking) (Horn honking) (People screaming) (Sirens wailing distantly) (Emergency radio chatter) (Voices speaking indistinctly) WOMAN: Was it the mother? (Heart monitors beeping) (Heartbeat pounding) Mom. Oh, my God. Look what happened to MJ. You're the mother? Yeah. She can't speak, but she keeps trying to. So I brought her that to write on. (Gasping softly) Hi. Shh. Baby, I'm right here. Don't try to talk. I'm right here. I'm right here. Shh. In case you need it. Hey. Shh. I've never been very good at this. I failed at... almost everything. But... I'm trying, MJ. I'm really trying. I shouldn't have let you go. It's just that... I was in a hurry. And your face... you just wanted to go so badly. I am so fucking stupid. So stupid. (Sniffling) Thank you, baby. I'm so sorry. (Sniffling) I'm so sorry. â™ª SHELL, NARRATING: Gas, grass or ass. Nobody rides for free. On August 7th, 1978, agents acting on reliable information from an undercover informant that passed contraband directly to the defendant conducted a successful raid at 142 Tropicana Circle. Agents were conducting a search of the premises when a vehicle containing Christina Milland stopped in front of the house. Miss Milland was a passenger in the vehicle, and had been targeted in an ongoing observation of the Pink Coral Inn, a known location for drug transactions. Christina Milland refused to cooperate by not giving her real name or address. Photos of the defendant were found in the house in the same room as women's clothing. (Keys rattling) (Cell door buzzing open) (Door buzzing open) SHELL: "Miss Milland was arrested in front of the house at 3:30 a.m., "just one hour after the initial raid. "They seized over 15,000 pounds of marijuana "with a street value of over $3 million. It is the largest drug seizure in the county's history." TEACHER: Well, thank you for sharing, Shell, and, uh, being at show and tell. Is the person in the article someone you know? She's my mom. (School bell ringing) So how'd it go? I don't know. I don't think they believed me. Told you they'd think it was weird, dodo bird. You're the dodo bird. Yeah? SHELL: Oh, no. MJ's driving? Sure is. But you watch that lead foot, all right? You got precious cargo back here. Yes, ma'am. Don't make me regret this. Okay, so you put your foot on the brake. I know. (Engine stalling) Okay, put your foot on the brake. Give it a little bit of gas, though. (Engine stalling) (Laughing) Okay. Okay, it's on the brake. (Laughing) Come on. (Engine starting) Whoo! (Laughing) â™ª It ain't no joke â™ª This time â™ª We pull the perfect crime â™ª â™ª And now it's written â™ª On every sign â™ª She's starving all her life â™ª â™ª Well, I'd say without even trying â™ª â™ª Everything's going to be all right â™ª â™ª Everything's going to be all right now â™ª CHRISTINA: Being a mom the only... the only thing that a mother thinks about is taking care of her children, no matter what. And I think a lot of the drug stuff where all the women are in jail, I think that's a big part of just trying to take care of your family, you know? If you can't get any government help or you can't find a job, then you resort to other things. That's the way it is. You do what you got to do, you know, to take care of your kids and your family. And that's what I did. â™ª â™ª â™ª To sail the sea â™ª Is what I dream about â™ª To ride the waves â™ª When I am setting out â™ª Oh, happy day â™ª When I sail the waves â™ª â™ª Oh, what I long â™ª The mighty ocean wide â™ª To let me roam â™ª Into the other side â™ª You'll never know â™ª Just how far I'll go â™ª To sail the sea â™ª It's all I think about â™ª For one more day â™ª I cannot go without â™ª I cannot stay â™ª I must sail away â™ª And as I roll into the ocean â™ª â™ª How happy I will be â™ª Goodbye, land-loving strangers â™ª â™ª Please say a prayer for me â™ª â™ª I'll steer the ship â™ª Through darkened seas at night â™ª â™ª And use the stars â™ª To guide my journey bright â™ª Oh, what a sight â™ª When I sail away â™ª High winds and waves â™ª This is a deadly ride â™ª How can it be â™ª That this is how I die? â™ª â™ª Who cried for me â™ª When I'm going insane? â™ª A sinking ship â™ª Out on the ocean blue â™ª It seems as if â™ª My sailing days are through â™ª â™ª I'll know my drift â™ª It's so sad, but true â™ª â™ª Maybe the tide â™ª Will bring me back someday â™ª â™ª I guess for now â™ª The sea will be my grave â™ª For I must brave â™ª When I sail away â™ª And as I sink into the ocean â™ª â™ª On a ship that's lost at sea â™ª â™ª Goodbye, land-loving strangers â™ª â™ª Don't shed a tear for me
