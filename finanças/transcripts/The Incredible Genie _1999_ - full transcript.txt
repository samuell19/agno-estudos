(Multicom Jingle) (slow music) - All my research and calculations are proved to be correct. In a few moments we could make the discovery of the century. - Proof that, that extraterrestrial 96 humans and all them, advance at science and technology like how to build pyramids like this. - That is postulating trans dimensional particle readings. This is huge. (slow music) (laughing) - Saheb Saheb Saheb You must expect to discover that the pyramids serve as a storage place for Jesus prophecies, which predict events up to the year 2000. - That's quite impressive, Ali. - Thank you Saheb. - Where'd you get that theory? - Great Libraries of Alexandria? - No, I read about it in my let's go Egypt, tour book. (laughing) - Egypt. - Yeah. So. What do you expect to find? Saheb. - I don't know. Something magical. With these aura detector goggles I will discover, if any unearthly energy field is present. (laughing) - Aura detector goggles. - This technology usually used for modifying human auras or biofields. But I've modified it to view mystical power sources. - You're crazy. - Through by view finder I will detect, if any mystical energy fields are present and they will be represented with bright light. And they will also... - The light is beautiful. (laughing) - Ali! - Sorry, Saheb. - Wait a minute, what's... What's this? (flat music) Come on, Ali. It wasn't funny the first time... Oh first the Mummy. (screaming) That explains the random mix of morphine. Hold up, Ali. (screaming) Ali. (glass breaking) - I am gonna get you. - Hey, kid. Hey, kid! - You could have killed me. - Tell me, Aqua boy. What are you doing stealing the money out of the wishing fountain? - For the past 41 weeks I've been making the same wish in this wishing fountain. It didn't even come true. It also wasn't even a big wish. I am entitled to a refund. 41 weeks breaks down in 281 days. And then $1.25 a day. That equals $358.75. - Listen, kid, I'm a cop. I see someone stealing money I take him downtown, okay? Let's go. - If you're so smart, tell me where the slang word "Cop" came from. - Now let's go down to the station. - Cop or Copper is an abbreviation for Constable on patrol. - I'm thrilled. Get out of there. - Next question. You have a young juvenile delinquent standing in the middle of the fountain. What do you do? - I give chase. - You should have called for backup. (upbeat music) - Come here you... Get back here. If I get my hands on you... I better not see you here again. - Hi, I like to buy a whole entire barrel of chocochip ice cream. - Hungry are we? - I am buying for the whole school today. - Can you afford it? - Let's just say I came across some money. - Pennies from heaven. - Sort of. (mumbling) - Attention everybody. Ice cream's on me today. Jimmy, Sally, Mark. You want some ice cream, it's all you can eat. Come on, guys. It's free. How about another flavor? Strawberry and cookie crumble. - [Student] Wait a second, I haven't seen... Look at their... (upbeat music) - Emily, do you want some ice cream? It's all you can eat. - No thanks, Simon. I already have a dessert. Matt gave me a scooter pie. - Can I get a refund? - What no takers? - I don't know what the problem is. Maybe they got paranoid, when they heard that little known fact about ice cream. - What little known fact? - That ice cream can cause a reduction of chemical enzymes in a lower esophagus. It happens in one out of every thousand. Mostly in children. But you have to eat a lot though. - That serious, huh? I don't think, that's your problem with the kids, Simon. - No. - No. Simon, you're the only kid in the whole school who's read the whole encyclopedia from cover to cover. It might make the others feel a little stupid. - Well, I'm often the tease. Do you suggest I stop reading it? - Simon, I think you should lighten up. - Dopler. - Dopler, sir. - I spent a hundred thousand dollars on another one of your field expeditions and you bring me back squat. - I swear to God, Farrow. I am confident, actual spiritualy possessed ambulatory verdosapien. - What? A Mummy, you know. The national security. National security agency division of paranormal research exist for the study of unexplained phenomena. In hopes of findings defensive applications. Good morning, Phil. We're not interested in ace bandages. We're interested in results and a result with hard core application. Just imagine. Our soldiers were impervious to heat or imagine a spirit God conducting clandestine espionage activities like breaking into the enemy secret file. And the options will be endless, when we can harness the power of the psychokinetic. - It's incredible, sir. Over 50 in one hour. I'd hate to have this guy over for dinner. (laughing) - Shut up. - Sorry, sir. - You're wasting time. Time to give this psychokinetic a practical test. - Yes, sir. - I venture it's truly the real deal. He certainly must be able to alter the course a poison dart with his shockwaves. (dart shot) Just what I thought. A fraud. Now listen, Doper. - Dopler, sir. - Congress, cut my budget in half again this year if you can't find something more substantial than this jump rope. I am gonna have to let you go. - But sir, I did. I did. Wait till you get a load of this. - What the hell is that? - It's a lamp. A magical lamp. The Castaneda levels are incredibly high. Cabalatron levels check out too. - Dobler - No, Dopler, sir. Now... - You're fired. - What? Sir, I've devoted my entire life to the study of magic I'm not qualified for anything else. - No, you'll... You'll figure something. - Good job, Dopler. (balloon bursting) - Simon. Look, look what Josh got me for our engagement party. - Nice. - Good, well... I guess, I'll be going now. I'll see you later. Bye. - Mom. I think you were trying to make me believe you forgot my birthday. But you know as well as I do. There's a cake behind that door. My name on it. So, if you kindly do the honors and get the ceremony over with. - The jig is up. What gave it away? - Maybe that you do this every year. - @Oh, he's a jolly good fellow - Look Simon. Come on, make a wish, blow off the candles. - Forget it. It never works anyway. It's just stupid superstitions. - Simon, you've got to believe. Remember when we sent all those chain letters? Remember that? I made a wish. I meet the man in my dreams and then I met Josh. - Fortune cookie? - Your perfect mate is near. - Three more weeks until our big day. (laughing) - Mom, you never sent those chain letters. I took them out of the mail box. Ever since dad died, you've been so gullible. - She has not. - I mean, chain letters? Come on. Why would sending mail increase your fortune? - Sport, you're just upset, because none your friends showed up for your birthday. - Reality check, I have no friends. - Honey, maybe the invites just got lost in the mail. - I'm because your 13 year old with an IQ of 151 and I look like a human version of Kermit the frog. - You do not look like a frog. - There's no doubt about it. I'm a geek, anonymous with nerds, spud, a brainiac, a ditch head, a fetus, a gimp, a loser and a twink. - You're none of those. - I'm all those things and more. In Japanese I'd be called "Coy guy." In Russian I'm (foriegn language) In German, I'm (foriegn language) There's no culture or barrier to what I am. That's why none of the kids came. (door bell ringing) - This must be your birthday surprise. - Well, hello there little boy. Are you ready for some magical magic? - Who are you Siegfried or Roy? (laughing) - It's simple, Simon. I am Dopler. The great world renowned magician. - You actually expect me to believe you possess magical powers? And yet you still choose to dress up in this polyester costume to entertain youngsters from minimum wage? - Cute. He's a cute kid, okay. And now for my next trick. I need an ordinary cup of H2O. As you can see there's nothing strange about it. (laughing) Wow! Magic. Magic. - That wasn't magic. You have some metalic potassium on your podium. When it's mixed with the water the Hydrogen was released. The heat generated by the reaction set the Hydrogen on fire. - You are quite correct. For my next trick I need an ordinary walking stick. Examine it if you will or even if you won't. And I will take this walking stick and I will change it into a snake. Hocus Pocus. (applause) - Bravo. - How'd he do that, Simon? - For the species of snake called "Naja Naja" peculiarity about this snake is it becomes temporarily paralyzed when you put pressure just below it's head. - Come on, Dopler. Do something the kid hasn't seen. I'm paying you good money. - This is my final trick. I will take this sword and I will put this sword down my throat. - No, stop it. Don't do it. - Simon. Let Dopler the great finish his trick. - Mom, sword swallowing isn't a trick. It's for real. They actually do swallow the sword. - What are you talking about? - With careful practice the mouth esophagus and stomach can be brought into a straight line to emit the blade of sword. But something tells me Dopler the great hasn't practiced in a while. Am I right? - You're quite correct, lad. - I admire your courage Dopler the great. But you don't have to hurt yourself just for a dumb magic show. - Call me that. I am not the Dopler the great. I am Dopler the unemployed. This is the second job I've lost in over a week. Now for my final trick I will make myself disappear. - Wait, wait. Stop. Wait, wait, let us pay you something. My, my kid really enjoyed your show. That's what's important. - Here, let me get it. Hope you accept cheques. - Oh, Josh, you're so generous. - Well. How about some cake? - Dopler, you forgot your stuff. (flat music) Strange markings. Earth Sumerian. (flat music) - Can you get me out of here? Come on, get me out of here. Oh, come on. Somebody please get me out of here. - What are you? - I'm the Genie of the lamp. - I am Bozo the Clown. - Pleased to meet you master Bozo. - You're, you're psycho traumatic hallucination manifested to symbolize my inability to deal with a lost my father figure. - Wrong. - Then I must be in some deep REM stage I'm sleeping and I'm dreaming. - Not even close. - And there's too much MSG in my chinese soup and I'm suffering some weird type overdose. - Just get me out of here and I'll prove to you that I'm the genie, okay? Come on. - Comeon, this is some weird dream. Okay. Here goes nothing. (screaming) - Hello, Master Bozo. - Got any clown outfits? I think, I'm more suited for that line of work. - Hey, where's the rabbit in the top hat? - Oh! Oh, yeah, sorry, one sec. Oh, great. Great, I left it behind. - Hey, fellow. If that rabbit has a little accident, you have to clean it up. - [Dopler] Keep it in your pants man. - Wow, it's great to be free. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, boy, I was getting a little bored in there. Let me tell you. I mean there's only so many time you can sing a billion bottles of dangers on the wall. You know the tune? - Can't believe this. - Believe it, Master Bozo. - [Simon] Quit call me Bozo. - But you just said, your name was Bozo. - I'm sarcastic. - Pleased to meet you, Master Sercastic. Oh, what a strange palace you live in. Who does your decorating? The library of kookie? - I meant to say, my name is Simon. Boy man, you have been in that lamp for too long. - It'll be 2,001 years a week from next Thursday. Boy I can feel every one of 'em. So, what's your wish, Master Simon? - Wait a second. You're gonna grant me wishes? - That's what Genies do. Haven't you ever read the Arabian Nights? Yes, read you, you read? - Three wishes to be exact, right? - Oh, that three wishe clause went out millennials ago. Stiff competition from Wizards, Fairies and Leprechauns forced us to abandon that policy, you know? Speaking of Leprechauns, have you ever been in an Irish kitchen? And if you don't know what that is, I feel sorry for you, lad. Hearts, moons, clovers. You get as many wishes as you want. So, it is written. So, it shall be done. - I won't be needing any I don't believe in wishes and I don't believe in you. You're just a figment of my imagination and you're gonna disappear now. - What is figment of imagination? Can you eat it? I'm hungry. - Mother of wheat. It's a pan dimensional ancient arabian apparition. - So, will I see you tomorrow? - Absolutely. Oh, say, listen. Could you lend me a couple of bucks? Because I'm all out of gas and I didn't get a chance to go to the cash machine. - Sure. - Last fortune cookie. - You will meet a wise and honorable man. Good nights. - Good night. - So you must be a pretty sad boy, if you don't believe in wishes. - I'm not sad. I'm just logical. It's impossible for wishes to come true. - It's impossible for wishes to come true? (laughing) If the impossible wasn't possible then how come I'm here? I mean, sometimes I think things that aren't possible might just be possible you think? - Look, my wishes don't come true, okay? I'll make a wish and I'll prove it, I'll show you my wishes don't come true. Let's see. I wish, I was filthy rich. - Your wish is my command. Sorry. Second here, gotta warm up, it's been a while. - Okay, a filthy rich, filthy rich, okay I feel it, Okay, all right, okay, all right, your wish is my command. - Great, look at what you've done. - Oops! - I'm not filthy rich, I'm just filthy. - Look at this way master, you got half your wish. - No, the way I look at it is proves that my wishes don't come true. - Oh, come on, master, and please give me another try, my powers must be a little bit rusty. I mean it's been a long time since I've used them, you know. - Okay, I wish this place was cleaned up. - Your wish is my command. - Oh, no, this is not my job, this is your mess. I'm going to bed and I expect you to clean this up. Now start shoveling. Better yet, I wake up from this nightmare. Have fun shoveling. (screaming) - Down master, down. The soldiers are shooting machines that breathes fire. - It's only TV, Genie. - You are a mighty sorcerer, Master Simon. - It's not sorcery, lend your ear and I'll explain. I don't really need your ear, it's just an expression. Now listen. TV is simply a process, where by images created by light are converted into electrical signals which are broadcast. Then transducer in the form of a cathode ray tube converts the electrical signals back into the light. Do you understand? - Yes, yes I do, Master. Yes, I do. So, how long have these soldiers lived in the box? - Never mind. What are you still doing here anyway? I thought you were supposed to leave when I got 40 winks. - Your wish is my command. You've got to stop taking me so literally. Weren't you like a bad dream or something? - I am no dream, I'm here to grant your every desire. Although, I can see you are already quite rich. What a huge gemstone. I've never seen one cut in quite such in an unusual fashion. It's called Lego bricks, maybe you are for real. - Oh, what a beautiful necklace. - Yeah, you're real all right, real stupid. And quit touching all my stuffs. - [Mom] Simon. - Yeah, Mom, get back in the lamp, get back in the lamp. - I just got out, I just got out. - [Mother] Simon, who are you talking to? - I'm just singing my prayers out loud, Mom. I wish you back in the lamp, now. - Your wish is my command. (humming) - Genie, you okay in there? - Oh, yeah, I'll be fine, I'm a little hungry but I'll just, you know play a song until you decide to rub the lamp and you know, let me out again, set me free, okay? - Tic-Tac? - Sure, thanks a lot. Tic-Tac. - Keep it down. Mom, how many times do I have to tell you? The psychic call lines are a rip off. Maybe I should call the phone company and put a block on those 900 numbers. - No, don't do that. I'll cut down, I'll promise. Breakfast? - I'm gonna be late for school, so I'll see you when get back from tennis. - Okay, well I'm I might be a little late, honey. Josh and I are getting wedding rings this afternoon. Bye, sweety. - Bye, mom. Mom. - What? I... Hello, hello, Oh, you have the wrong number. Wrong number. - Phone didn't even ring. - Oh, that's well the ringer's broken. (ringing) Go to school. (ringing) Go, go to school. (ringing) Bye, sweety. - Bye, mom. (ringing) (upbeat music) - Hey, there she is. - Yeah. - No, I don't like them. - I knew it. (upbeat music) - I wish, I had a new pair of shoes. - Your wish is my command. - Genie, you're not suppose to be here, hide. Get under the table. (laughing) - Simon, what are those on your feet? (music) Simon, what are you doing? - Oh, I'm looking for my retainer. - Hey, look what Simon's wearing. (laughing) - What's with the shoes? - The shoes. They're part of my presentation for History class on Arabian culture. Did you know that it's a little known fact did not only, did the Asian-Arabian's invent the first numeral system. They also invented the first athletic shoe. Yeah, they based the shoe design on boats in the Persian Gulf. They figured, if the boat design can cut through water, if the shoe design can cut through air. I can speed up delivery and message by foot. I think this shoe design is the wave of the future. - Simon, you're kind of a know it all. - I know, I wish I could turn back the clock and start that conversation all over again. Oh, oh. - Check it out. - Calling my presentation in History class... - Simon, what are you doing? - Gross. - Stop it, Simon. That's not nice. - Man, you're really weird. - No listen, I can explain. I got this Genie in this lamp and.. - Right. - No, I, I'll show, come on. - Let me see that. - Hey, what are you doing? Give it. - Give it back. - Now, stand back everybody, there's a magical Genie inside and I'll make him appear. I'll show you. Any second now and Genie will appear. (rock music) Come on, Genie. I command you to appear. - You're dreaming, Simon. Come on guys. (rock music) Come on, Emily. - Oh, okay. (mumbling) (mumbling) (rock music) - Are you okay? (rock music) - Hi, Simon. - Hi, Emily. - I liked your story about the Genie today. - It wasn't a story. - It's okay, Simon. I think it's nice, you have such a vivid imagination. - But I don't have a vivid imagination. It wasn't a story. - Okay. Yeah, well anyways I would like people with imagination. See ya. - Of course, I have an imagination. It was all a story. Next week I'll tell you about how I play poker with gargoyles Great bunch of guys. - Okay. - Genie, where have you been? - Which one of you said that? - The middle one. - Oh, oh. I think I'm gonna be okay. - Well, I'm not. You know what they do to kids who wear those types of shoes? Believe me, it's not pretty. You get me into all sorts of troubles, so I'm wishing you home. - Your wish is my command. - Don't touch anything in my house either. He heard me, right? Yeah, he must've heard me. (alarm sound) (noise) (upbeat music) (telephone ringing) - [Operator] Hello, this is the alarm company. We've received a signal from your house, is everything okay? Hello? - Hello. - Hello. Mrs. Alexander? - Hello? - Hello? - Hello. - [Operator] Hello, it's the phone company. Mrs. Alexander, is there a problem? Is something... (noise) - I swear to God, Farrow and I came across an actual hydro confabulated walking postulating verdosapien. - What are you saying to me? What do you mean? - Sir. The subject claims, he can read people's minds. - I'm seriously doubt that. - Sir? I have you a proof. - It's a cheap camera trick. It's a pan dimensional ancient Arabian apparition. - What is that? - A Genie, sir. - You bring me the proof of a real Genie maybe I'll put you on the first team, now get out of here. - Thank you, sir. - Well, Mr. Mind reader. Tell me one of my inner most secrets. - A secret you know? There's a big crowd. They're watching President Kennedy's motorcade. There's a gunman. I see a trigger finger. The man's wearing a... A ring with a red gem in it. He pulls the trigger And I see the bullet... - That's nonsense. That's absolute nonsense, bull hockey. Get this man out of here. Somebody bring me the woman who claims she can speak with cats. (screaming) (hissing) Oh, boy. Oh, boy. (slow music) (whistling) (upbeat music) - [Actor] Come on, you can do this. - Who are you? - No pain, no pain. - One, two, three... - Why? - Up and down, lift it up. - You're small, just like the soldiers. Does Simon keep you in this box all the time? - [Actor] Ten more. - He's a tough master. I know what it's like to be cooped up. (birds chirping) (noise) - Oh, no! (upbeat music) (mumbling) - [Coach] That's it, that's it. The body, the body, come on! Come on, go after him! He's yours, he's yours, come on! That's it, that's it. (upbeat music) - Oh, no! What has Genie done? There it is, I don't need your stinking body. You stink. (screaming) - Wish them back into the box. I wish I can, but I can't control them. And looking out. (horse neighing) - Tell me, we didn't see that. - See what? - I wish... - What's that noise? - Maybe Simon's playing with some friends. - All the people back in TV and everything back where it belongs. (upbeat music) - Master Simon, I'm so glad you're home. Only your wish could send those little people back into the box. They are much too noisy. - What did you do? That's my mom's dress! - Oh, no, no. This is another one just like it. The box people wanted me to wear a robe. Your mother has such excellent taste in robes. Would you like to see it in green? - No! - Simon? Simon, are you home? - Take off the dress, take it off, take it off! (clapping) Put it back on, put it back on! (clapping) Hi, mom. Nice, hat. See you later. - Who's this? - Who? - This. - This? He's a new foreign exchange student, Roy. - What's he doing wearing your mother's new dress? - Who you rather, he wore an old dress? - Welcome to America. - He's shy, can we discuss this later? I'm busy. Could you please take that dress off? It's really starting to bug me. - Ma'am? - Yes? - We had a call from the alarm company. Is everything all right? - Oh, it must've been my son. He must have put the alarm off by mistake. Kids, you know. - Yeah, kids, yeah. (laughing) - What are you doing? - You were talking about the wave of the future. I thought I'd try and come up with it. I think this is good for "Hello". I think this... Good for... "Goodbye" - Wave of the future means new technology. Like what's gonna be new in fashion? The new best thing. Don't you get anything right? - [Genie] Are you mad at me? - Of course, I'm mad at you. Let me pick your brain for a moment. - Okay. - That's not what I meant, it's an expression. It means I wanna know what you think. You ruined my life, do you realize that? Do you know how much trouble you've caused? - This much? - No, this much. And I want you to keep your hands like that from now on. No more clapping and no more granting wishes. You've already convinced my mom that my new best friend's a cross dressing exchange student named Roy. - Well what about you? - What about me? - Yeah, we get, not so perfect yourself, you know. Shoes don't make the man. And I wasn't the one showing off how smart I am, you know, in the school. How the Arabians invented the show they created the design from the... - All right! - And another thing. - What? - I've got an itch. Yeah scratch me, kinda... That's good, yeah. Oh yeah a little harder. (noise) You know there are lots of ways to make friends. - And I'm sure you're an expert. - Yes. - Before that evil sorcerer turned me into a Genie I had lots of pals. I even had a girlfriend. As pretty as a Harlem dancer. You would like to see a picture of her? Yes, picture, yes, picture? - Sure. (laughing) - She is beautiful, yes. (laughing) (foreign language) - All right! - I'll never forget the first time I saw her. She was riding on her camel. You know what she said to me? - What did she say? - I'll tell you. She said, "Hey! Get out of here, you piece of garbage!" It wasn't exactly love at first sight. - So what'd you do to win her over? - I told her she had the most beautiful brown eyes I'd ever seen. Believe me. I miss her desperately. She was the daughter of a king. - You know, what Genie? Maybe you weren't cut out for granting wishes. I mean you didn't wanna be a Genie in the first place. - I'm just a little rusty, that's gotta be it. Maybe if you could give me a couple of tries at the same wish then, eventually I can get the hang of it and give you exactly what you want. - I know, Genie make me a king. - Your wish is my command. (clapping) Hey. - Genie, I said, "A king" not "The king". - All right, man. Don't get all shooked up. Give me another try, okay baby? Sorry about that. (clapping) - Nothing happened. - Please master, give me one more try. - Too dangerous, you're liable to turn me into Kingfisher or King Kong or something. - Come on. - What are you doing? (slow music) Genie, you did it. You did turn me into a king. - I did? I did it. I did it! - Come on, let's go see my kingdom. Hey, mom! - Be back in a couple of hours, hon. - You know, sweetheart, I think when we get married we should get a bigger house. This place is just too vent. (noise) (flat music) - Incredible! Incredible. - We've got to change everything back to normal fast. I mean, people see this castle, they're gonna wanna know where it came from. News media, talk shows, paparazzi. If they all investigate, they'll find you. - Three dimensional setback manifestation (mumbling) - Genie. I wish I wasn't king anymore. - Your wish is my command. (clapping) - Nothing happened. (knocking) (screaming) - There goes the king. (upbeat music) - Go, Genie! The knights are here to dispose the king which is me. - I'm sorry, sir... I mean master. (screaming) Do something! - Do something! - Make a wish. - I wish for peace. - Yeah, your wish is my command. (clapping) @ Amazing @ Grace @ How sweet @ The sound @ That saved @ A wretch - This is not what I meant. (upbeat music) Go! - We're trapped! - I wish for a magic carpet then. - Your wish is my command. (clapping) - It worked. Fire ahead, carpet. - Maybe it's afraid of heights. - A figure... - Oh. I'm gonna crash. (mumbling) - Yes. knight, knight. Oh no, more Knights. Turn right, turn right. - Watch out. (screaming) (laughing) - Throw them in the dungeon. (screaming) - The ectoplasmic graphic readings are really high. Oh. (upbeat music) - This is Simon's house. - Simon lives here? - Yeah. - Oh. - I bet aliens drop this off, after having abducted it a hundred years ago. - As a matter of fact. No. - Then, maybe it's a mass hallucination. Like that time the whole town saw the Virgin Marry in a dairy mark sign. - No. - Well then what is it? - It's a three dimensional sub particle manifestation of an Arabian operation. - What? - Why do I always have to repeat myself doesn't anybody listen I just said it was a Genie, okay? Okay? Come on. - Genie? - Maybe Simon was right when he said he's got a Genie. - I love driving your car. - Oh gosh, Josh. I deserve you. - Well you know, I only have eyes for you. - What is this? Oh, my God. - Well, I don't know how it happened. But, we're rich. Which is in that life insurance policy your husband left. Wonder what this is appraise for. - What about Simon? - We can't sell Simon. - I'm gonna see you if he's okay? - Hold. - Hi. My boy is inside here and I'm going to run in and get him quickly and I will return shortly. Thank you. Excuse me. - No one passes. - Okay. All right. Thank you. - This is Connie Hennessy of CBN news reporting to you live from a very unusual scene. (foreign language) - Tell me, Demon. Would you be willing to work for the United States Government? (screaming) Right. I'm suppose to give progress report to congress in a week. - Excuse me, sir. I think there is something you should look at. - As you can see, the gigantic castle has suddenly appeared in the heart of... We're trying to estimate if anyone is inside There has been reports... - Dopler was right. - I demand to see a state appointed attorney. Oh, snakes. I hate snakes. - Oh. Just relax. - Relax? How can I relax? - I was talking to this snake. He looks a little bit nervous. - Him? What about me? It's a little known fact, the back in medieval times they will tie the captured kings arms to a horse. Then, they will tie his legs to a horse. Then, they would have riders gallop in opposite directions until the king snapped in half. - I'm sorry, Master Simon, I swear I only meant to please you. I never meant to cause you any trouble, you're my good friend. - You're not my friend. - Sure I am. You were worried about me. That's why you wanted this castle to go away. You don't want them to come looking for me. - You're dreaming. - No, I'm not dreaming, I'm wide awake. You really care about me. You gave up your castle to save me. That's what friends do. - I'm not your friend, okay? You've been causing me trouble ever since I found you in that lamp. - You don't really mean that. - I do. I wish you would just leave me be. - Your wish is my command. - Hey! Get off. I said leave me be, not leave me bees. See what I mean? You're nothing but trouble. (mumbling) (upbeat music) (mumbling) - [Soldier] Get out of the way. (mumbling) (mumbling) (mumbling) Ladies and gentlemen, out of the way please. - Glad we understand each other. - You can count on me. - Good. Now, inform the boy's mother that we here to rescue him. all these fire power, that's what it's for. - Yeah, well listen, just don't do any damage. This castle's gotta be worth a bundle. - It's very important that she remains here. Tell her, tell her, it's too dangerous for her to attempt to get to the boy alone. - Right. - Have you found the boy and the lamp? - No, sir. - Commence the seek and attack mission. - Attack? - You've done some good work here, Dopler. - Dopler, sir. - President is gonna be very impressed with my find. - Your find? - Yes. You let that lamp slip through your fingers. Or would you mind giving credit for recovering it? - But, but, I, I'm, I'm the guy that found... - Do you realize what this lamp is, Dopler? - It is Dopler Sir, Dopler. - It's the most important military weapon since the A-bomb. - Move it. - If this Genie can conjure up a castle full of lights. Imagine what other armies he can create. (mumbling) - Sir. - Is our team ready? - Yes, Sir. - Excellent. - Artillery is secure. - All right, then listen up. - All tactical forces (mumbling) - We must capture that lamp by any means. If that boy resists, we'll have no option but to use force. - He's just a boy, you just can't consider hurting him. - I'm considering all possibilities, Dopler. What would happen if that lamp fell into the hands of terrorists? You don't know. We must have that lamp by any means. Guys, let's move out, follow me. - Don't worry, sir. These are trained professionals. They're government agents. They are here to protect and to serve. They're here to rescue Simon. - [Mrs. Alexander] Well I guess you have a point. - Mrs. Alexander - Dopler the good. - The great. - Actually the guilty. Mrs. Alexander, I know this may sound highly irregular. But, it's my fault that Simon is trapped inside that castle. - What did you do Dopler? Conjure this place up by pulling a rabbit out of your hat? - There must be some kind of way outta here. What are you doing? - I thought this might help my train of thought. Maybe you should try wishing us out of here. - Forget it. I'm not risking any of my wishes, okay? There's gotta be a logical way. - Logical? What kind of magic is that? - It's not magic. It's anti magic. It means, you don't lie anything except for your own brain. I gotta think of a way outta here. - Somehow, Simon has unleashed the Genie from within side the lamp. (laughing) - A Genie? (laughing) - Well then how else do you describe this great every standing sub particle mass paranormal phenomenon? - Prime real estate. - Okay, these guys... They aren't your normal government agents. They're with the NSA's top secret division of Paranormal Research. I am one... Of their former agents. These guys, they wanted to get a hold of the lamp and exploit the Genie for military purposes. They'll do anything to get it. Even hurt your little boy if necessary. - The government would not go around hurting innocent people. No. (upbeat music) (mumbling) (mumbling) - What is that? - Come on, Sandra. You're not buying this guy's story, are you? - You've got a great kid, Mrs. Alexander. I would hate to see something happen to him. - This is crazy. I have to side with my fiance. We should let the government do their job. (mumbling) (screaming) (mumbling) (screaming) What's that noise? - Nothing, it's just my Octopus Monographer. Measures mystical energy fields and castinating units. When the collaboration's off. Anything can set it off. Like this four leaf clover. - I believe you. It's four leaf clover. This is a sign Yes. - I know, Genie get back in the lamp. - What did I do? - Just do it I'll explain later. - Your wish my command. - Good. Hey Genie. I wish you'd reappear. Excellent, now go get the keys. And don't touch that lever. It moves that wall. Unlock the door. Perfect. - Where's the boy? - I'm sworn to secrecy. - Okay. Here's your secrecy. (laughing) It brings tears to your eyes, doesn't it? (laughing) What about you? You know where is the boy is? - The king is in the dungeon. He's in the dungeon. - Excellent, excellent. Follow me. (crying) (mumbling) (gunshot) - Halt. - You see, President sent me to verify arms defile findings - Let's see your authorization. - So suddenly, I'll give you all my walking stick while I find my papers? Let's see. (screaming) All right. (flat music) - He's not here. Team, spread out. Find that boy. Now, now. - Send the Josh, help me tie this guy up. - That's really great. - Genie, our stuff is little bit lost. - (mumbling) a little bit of magic. - Magic. - Magic. - No, we are sitting ducks. - Your wish is my command. (duck quacking) - Oh, it's Simon's knapsacks. He was here. - Simon. It's your mom and Josh. - (mumbling) - Simon. - Let us out. - There's no key. Maybe this. (screaming) Maybe not. I'll go see if there is a key in the guard's room. - And now for my next trick. - Josh. - I have modified it to view mystical powers sources It's a better interesting phenomenon you see. Wait a minute. I am getting a residual transcendental particle part of the Genie's footsteps. Oh, look at this. This is strange. Prints are offered to a duck. - What? Peaking? - I always (mumbling) form of this one. It's nothing. It's fun. - Watch out. (mumbling) - You are on the alerts. Intruders have entered the castle. - Thanks. - We should head back find another passageway around these guards. - We can't do that. We're running out of time. For all we know, Farrow may have got Simon already. Besides, we know the Genie went this way the odds are Simon is with him. I suggest we find a passageway pass these guards. - Come on, Sandra. Let's go. - Excuse me, excuse me. This is Sandra's, this is Sandra's son. Shouldn't be her decision. - All right, well let's Sandra decide. Sandra? - Right. It should be my decision. And I think... Well no, I think we should... - Wanna Fortune cookie for guidance? - That might help. - Hey, wait a minute. Let me see those Fortune cookie. This one says, "Always trust the one you love." There's a second one. And it says the same thing. "Always trust the one you love." - What's going on Josh? - I don't know how that happened. Just lucky I guess. - I bet that this isn't the first time he's tried this. He's been preying on your superstition, Sandra. - Shut up. - I bet he made a deal with Farrow. How much is he... How much is he paying you to prevent Sandra from getting to the boy with the lamp. - I don't understand. - He's crazy. Let's head back. - She know the top streets (whispering) - You're a wise Wizards, Master Simon. - No wizardry, just brain power. (mumbling) She's little bit gullible She believes in all sorts of mystical things. - You don't believe. - I did it long time. Every day before school I make the same wish. I wish for one special friend. But my wish never came true. So I stopped wishing and got smart. - Sandra, Sandra. Do you realize your fiance is up to his ears in debt. Overdrawn bank accounts, unpaid bills credit cards, bookies you name it. I checked him out when his cheque bounced. - Is this true, Josh? - I got money problems like everybody else. - Sandra, don't you see this? He's even marrying you so that is his wife you become responsible for his debt. - He's lying. You know I love you, Sandra. - Did you ever see him pay for anything with cash? - Actually no. I, no, he always borrowed that from me. - Well. He's made a deal with Farrow. A deal rich enough that he doesn't need to marry you to get out of hawk. He doesn't need you or Simon. - If you don't shut up. I'm gonna yell so loud I'm gonna bring the guards down here. - Josh. - Look, I can take care of all my problems in one fell swoop Now, I suggest we go this way. If not I'm goanna yell for the guards and we can wait for Simon in a dungeon or outside. Personally I prefer outside. But it's your choice. - I'm such a sucker. - Well, what do we do now? It's your choice. - This way. (foot steps) When I was married, my husband used to make all the decisions. I believed in him. I guess when he died I couldn't make many decisions by myself. That's why I like to read my horoscope. I call a secret hotline every now and then and search in the letter. Which is easier to have others make decisions for me. I can't do that anymore. - Well I think you're making the right decisions now. So, how do I look? - Frightening. - Good. While I scare those Knights. You sneak by, okay. - Okay. - What is it? (screaming) - I don't know. (laughing) - But I am going to see if it bleeds. (screaming) (screaming) (screaming) - Mom! - Simon! (upbeat music) (squeaking) (screaming) (squeaking) - Mom, there's someone I'd like you to meet. - Yes, Genie. I've heard all about you. I did think you were a little hairy for the seventh grade. - Hello. - Simon, we've gotta get out of here. - I know, mom. There's these knights... - Oh, forget the knights. We have to watch out.. For them! (screaming) (upbeat music) (giggling) - Hurry. All right, come on. Come on! - Excellent. Excellent. Our rescue operation has been a success. We have the boy and the Genie. - Simon, don't give him the lamp. He's just going to exploit the Genie for military purposes. - Simon, Dopler here has misconstrued my words. I would protect that Genie from others who would exploit him. Now you could imagine what would happen if that lamp fell into the wrong hands. You know. My country... The country will protect him from harm, it would shield him. - It seems logical. But my gut tells me something else. - Mr. Farrow. If Simon gave the lamp to you do you promise the Genie would not be harmed? - I'm... I, I promise, I promise. - Simon? Honey? I think you should handover the lamp to, Mr. Farrow. - But, mom... - Trust your mother, sweetie. Here's the lamp. You can have it. - Go, Genie, go! - Run, Simon! - Open up! - Genie! - Genie, I wish I could turn back the clock. - Are you sure? Remember what happened last time? - I'm sure, I'm sure! - Your wish is my command. (clapping) (noise) (rewind noise) What are we gonna do? - Come on! - Genie, I wish I was filthy rich. - What? - Just do it. (mumbling) - Wipe out. (screaming) - Yes! - Hey! Come on! - Sorry, Genie. - It's not your fault. - Yeah, it is a total big time. If I would have been paying attention where I was going, none of this would happen. - I forgive you. - This way, this way. - Mr. Alexander. You'll be happy to know that your interaction with the Genie has caused you no little effects at all. No exposure to radiation, no DNA damage, no sign of infectious disease. There is one final test to be conducted in order to determine whether or not Genie's magic works for masters other then yourself. So, Genie. - Yes, master. - I wish I had A spear. - Your wish is my command. - Excellent. Pretty good, huh, Phil? Now Genie, I want a Soviet AG9 anti tank rocket launcher. - Your wish is my command. - Fantastic. - Stop it, you're hurting him he doesn't like making weapons. - Quite kid, I'm the master here now. Time for something more challenging, Genie. I want a nuclear bomb. - Your wish is my command. - Very impressive. - Genie, how come all his wishes are being granted perfectly. - I don't know, maybe he's wishing for what is truly in his heart. And yours weren't, maybe that's why your wishes never came up perfectly. - We don't need the boy any longer, take him away. Get him outta here. - Genie. - Get him outta here. - Genie, you did grant my wishes perfectly. - I did? - Yes, you give me a special friend. - Really, who? - Don't you know? it's you! It's you, Genie! Mom. Mom, you should go help the Genie. We should save him. - Ms. Alexander. Ms. Alexander. You're the owner of this property, what happened inside? - This is a little hard to believe but there's a lamp. With the Genie inside, this has been our house for five years now. - Mom. - I cannot explain the castle and the Genie. But the US government is responsible for this. - Mom, we have to do something now. - I'd like the (mumbling) help in letting my neighbors know and America know what the Government is doing here. - So, what'd you wish for? - I wished for a friend to help me rescue the Genie. - I'll help, I heard your mom tell the reporters how you tried to help the Genie. I think it is pretty new, what you did. - Yeah, can I help? - You guys all want to help? - Yeah. - Yes. - Why? - You're looking at me funny, like you want to say something. - You have the most eyes I've ever seen in the world. - I only have two. - That's not what I meant. I mean, you have these eyes. They are brown. - They're blue. - Oh yeah. Anyway, I like them. - Thanks. - This light went off when I first found the lamp. - I think it detects some sort of magical energy or something. Oh, just as I expected. - Yeah, - Most castles have tunnels leading to the outside. They will use in case of war. - Cool. - Wanna know what else is cool? - What? - That the white house in Washington DC also secret tunnels leading to the outside. - Really? - Yeah. There was a rumor that president Nixon actually would sneak out at 2 a.m in the morning with coffee and donuts. - You know a lot of great stuff, Simon. - Yeah. - Well is everyone ready? - Yeah. - Simon says, follow me and quietly. - Mr. Farrow would like to have a word with you, come. - Yeah, follow me. (upbeat music) - Split up! - No, stop stop stop there. - Fig and Jones, find those intruders now I want nothing to get in the way of my experiments, go. Your powers are amazing my friend you are going to serve our countries exactly well. - As you wish. - Aren't you forgetting something? - As you wish, master. - Master, I like the sound of that. Yes, Genie I can get very fond of hearing that. You know, Genie, perhaps it's possible that you might not be serving our country after all. You'll be serving me. As long as I have the lamp. - Master Simon! - Hello Genie. - Welcome, Mr. Alexander. Now you can participate in my next test of the Genie's powers. - How is that? - Well up until now, I've... I've had him create only conventional weapons. Yes, I think it's time for something unconventional let's see, what should I wish for? I want you to make me a giant snake, a Scorpion, no, no snake is good. Scorpion in the other hand. - I'm sorry. Your wish is my command. (laughing) - I like it. Now, I'm going to get you once and for all. (laughing) Now you've made me a poisonous snake, Genie. - Help me. - Mr. Alexander. I will destroy you. I will destroy you. Genie, I will destroy you. I will... Alexander! - That was close, Genie, let's get out of here. (screaming) - You think we lost them? - I don't know. - Keep going, Simon. They're right behind us. - They will never stop chasing us, where can we go? - Maybe there's a way. - How? - I can send you back to your own time, I can send you home, Genie. - I can't leave you, you'll be losing your Genie. - No, I'll be losing a friend, but it's the only way. - They're getting closer, do something. - Why don't you come with me? Come with me. - I can't, I belong here with my friends. - Come on, we gotta get out of here. - Thank you, master. - Call me, Simon. - Very well. - It's my final wish, I wish to send you home. - Your wish is my command. - If you want it, you can have it. (mumbling) - Well it is getting late and I think I'm going up to bed. Thanks. - Mom. I thought we agreed on this already. - Gosh, I really don't know what you're talking about. Okay, the jig is out. @ He's a jolly good fellow @ For he's a jolly good fellow @ For he's a jolly good fellow Nobody can deny. @ Which nobody can deny - Happy birthday. (applause) - Oh, wait, Simon doesn't like candles. - Mom, it's okay, wishes are like friends, you can never get enough. - Keep rubbing, Phil, keep rubbing. The Genie has got to come out of there sometime. (guitar music) (Multicom Jingle)
