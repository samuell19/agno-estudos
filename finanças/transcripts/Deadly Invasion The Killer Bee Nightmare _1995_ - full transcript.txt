( insect buzzing ) PATROL 2 TO DISPATCH. Woman: Go ahead, Lamar. What you got for me? I'M 15 MILES OUT ON THE 6. LOOKS LIKE I GOT SOME FARM WORKERS HOLED UP AT THE OLD BOWIE PLACE. OKAY IF I GO GET 'EM OUT OF THERE BEFORE ONE OF THEM SNEEZES AND THE WHOLE PLACE COMES DOWN? Ten-four, on that, Patrol 2. ANYBODY IN THERE?! HAY NADIE ADENTRO? HEY, FOLKS, PEACE OFFICER. TIME TO RISE AND SHINE. YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY IN THE SAFEST PLACE HERE. ( buzzing ) ( screaming ) THE DEPOSITIONS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE TWO DAYS AGO. NO... WE ARE KIND OF OUT OF THE WAY HERE. NO.

( sighs ) HEY, JOHN SAYS HE HAS SOMETHING HE WANTS TO SHOW US DOWN IN THE CELLAR. IS IT GOING TO COST US MONEY? PROBABLY. OH, NO. HERE'S WHAT I WANTED TO SHOW YOU. OH, WOW. MUTANT GOPHERS. John: NOPE. IT'S A CRAWLSPACE. THE PREVIOUS OWNERS USED IT TO TUNNEL VEGETABLES FROM THE BARN. I CHECKED. IT STILL GOES THROUGH. NOW, THE INSET HERE IS 10 DEGREES COOLER THAN THE REST OF THE CELLAR. I COULD ENCLOSE THIS AND MAKE THIS YOUR WINE STORAGE. 'COURSE IFFEN I DO THAT, IT'LL CLOSE OFF THE CRAWLSPACE. WE'RE COMFORTABLE USING THE FRONT DOOR. DEFINITELY. "GOPHER" IT. WE'RE NOT MY MOM AND DAD. THANK GOD. NO. I MEAN IT. IT FINALLY HIT ME THIS MORNING. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP MY MOTHER WASN'T RUNNING HER OWN BUSINESS. SHE ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF TIME FOR US AND MY FATHER WAS HOME EVERY NIGHT, 6:30 SHARP. YOU AND I, ON THE OTHER HAND... WE GET THIS ORCHARD UP AND RUNNING WE'LL BOTH BE ABLE TO CUT BACK. YOU CAN HIRE SOME HELP FOR THE DAY-TO-DAY STUFF AND I'LL BE ABLE TO EASE OFF ON MY LAW PRACTICE SPEND MORE TIME ON MY NOVEL. JOHN GRISHAM, LOOK OUT. HEY... I PROMISE I'LL BE HOME AS CLOSE TO 6:30 AS I CAN. YEAH, BUT I WON'T. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT IN TOWN TONIGHT TO LOOK AT OFFICE SPACE. CHAD, YOUR CAR KEYS. HEY, RANDI. OH, HI, MR. INGRAM. WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE? SACRAMENTO'S GOT US PUTTING OUT THESE TRAPS. TRAPS FOR WHAT? A.H.B.s BEES, AFRICANIZED HONEY BEES. YOU KNOW, KILLER BEES. KILLER BEES? AROUND HERE? THE DEPARTMENT OF A.G. REP I.D.'d SOME SPECIMENS IN TALFORD, 35 MILES FROM HERE. SACRAMENTO'S GOT THE WHOLE VALLEY ON ALERT JUST IN CASE. I WOULDN'T LET IT WORRY YOU. WE'VE KNOWN THEY WERE COMING FOR SOME TIME. WE'LL BE READY FOR THEM. ( sighing ) NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT KILLER BEES WHEN WE WERE SHOPPING FOR A HOUSE. KEN. CHAD, COME ON OVER. COME ON OVER, CHAD. COME ON OVER. IT'S ALL RIGHT. KEN... I, UH... I SPLIT OFF YOUR 50% INTEREST IN THE FAMILY'S BEE BUSINESS AND INSERTED LANGUAGE TO INCLUDE YOUR NEW WIFE BUT I WANT TO GO OVER THE PERCENTAGES WITH YOU MAKE SURE I'VE GOT THEM RIGHT. 20% COMES FROM HONEY SALES, RIGHT? AND THE OTHER 80% COMES FROM POLLINATION SERVICES... SOUNDS PERFECT. HOW MANY BEES DO YOU HAVE HERE EXACTLY? THIS LOCATION? LET'S SEE... 50,000 PER HIVE, 12 HIVES, SOMETHING LIKE 600,000. BUT MY HIVES ALL OVER THE VALLEY-- IT'S SOMETHING CLOSER TO 25 MILLION IN ALL. AND THAT'S JUST ME. THERE'S FOUR OTHER BEE FARMS AROUND HERE. 100 MILLION? AREN'T YOU AFRAID OF BEING STUNG? NO. YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE THEM A REASON TO STING YOU. IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH BEES THEY'LL BE COMFORTABLE AROUND YOU. HERE. I'M GOING TO NEED YOU AND YOUR FATHER TO SIGN THIS. YOU AND KAREN ARE STILL PLANNING ON COMING TO THE WEDDING, RIGHT? YEAH. YEAH, MY DAD'S RACING A SHELBY DOWN IN CROWNLEY THIS WEEKEND. YOU GOING? OF COURSE. MY DAD MADE ME PART OF THE PIT CREW. HE PROMISED I COULD DRIVE ONCE I TURN 18. TRAVIS, YOU THINK MAYBE YOUR DAD COULD USE SOMEBODY ELSE DOWN AT CROWNLEY? I'M REAL GOOD WITH ENGINES. LIKE MY DAD'S GOING TO LET YOU GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE SHELBY'S ENGINE. BUT YOU COULD SHOW UP AT THE GARAGE AT 6:00 SATURDAY MORNING AND RIDE DOWN WITH US. OKAY. OKAY. DON'T BE LATE, MAN. I WON'T.

THIS DOESN'T BOTHER YOU? NAH. WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT IT FOR YEARS. I TOOK A CLASS A COUPLE OF SUMMERS AGO. THEY'RE NOT REALLY KILLERS IF YOU KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THEM. THEY'RE JUST MORE AGGRESSIVE IN DEFENDING THEIR TERRITORY THAN THE EUROPEAN BEES. IF YOU MESS WITH THEIR HIVE OR THEY PERCEIVE YOU TO BE A THREAT THEY'LL COME AT YOU FAST AND FURIOUS. THEY ATTACK IN GREATER NUMBER THAN OUR KIND OF BEES. THEY DON'T GIVE UP AS EASILY. AND NONE OF THIS WORRIES YOU? NAH. DAD? DAD, WHAT'S WRONG? THEY ARE UPSET. SOMETHING HAS THEM VERY UPSET.

( crashing ) ( buzzing ) IT'S MY GIRL, CHAD. HER AND TRAVIS WERE OUT ON THE INTERSTATE WHEN SOME TRUCKER JUST PLOWED RIGHT INTO THEM! OH... DO YOU REALIZE THIS TRUCK DRIVER'S STILL UPSTAIRS AND HE'S THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO LIVE? LISTEN, I WANT THIS GUY. I WANT HIM, AND YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME. I WANT TO PROSECUTE HIM AND HIS WHOLE DAMN COMPANY! MY ADVICE TO YOU IS FORGET ABOUT THE TRUCKER. HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. YOU'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT LOIS AND THE KIDS. JUST SO LONG AS WE DON'T LET HIM SNAKE HIS WAY OUT OF THIS. I DON'T THINK IT WAS THE TRUCKER'S FAULT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IT WASN'T HIS FAULT? BOTH KIDS HAVE LATERAL SCRATCH MARKS, PERRY, MAINLY ON THEIR ARMS, LEGS, NECKS. THESE AREN'T FROM THE ACCIDENT. THEY'RE SELF-INFLICTED FROM THE KIDS' OWN FINGERNAILS. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I DON'T THINK TRAVIS WAS PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ROAD. I THINK HE WAS UNDER MASSIVE ATTACK AND WAS TRYING TO GET AWAY. MASSIVE ATTACK? GET AWAY FROM WHO? YOU'RE NOT DOING A HECK OF A LOT THERE. TRAVIS WAS, LIKE, THE COOLEST GUY IN TOWN. AND HE'D TALK TO ME-- YOU KNOW? HE'D LET ME HANG OUT WITH HIM... MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS STINKIN' TOWN EVER DID. HE DIDN'T DESERVE TO DIE. WHAT IS IT THEY'RE USING TO KILL THE BEES? THEY SAID IT'S SOME KIND OF A DETERGENT MIX. PLAIN OLD SOAPY WATER. IT CLOGS BEES' PORES, SUFFOCATING THEM. JOSHUA, WANT TO SAY HELLO TO MR. AND MRS. INGRAM? HI, JOSH. HIYA, JOSH. HE'S IN ONE OF HIS MOODS. THE WEDDING AND ALL HAS GOT HIM ON THE WARPATH. SO DID YOU KNOW THE KIDS THAT DIED? KRISTYN WAS A FRIEND OF OUR OLDEST DAUGHTER TRACY. I USED TO COACH TRAVIS IN SATURDAY MORNING SOCCER. HI. CHAD, KAREN, I WANT YOU TO MEET MY FIANCEE LINDA. HELLO, LINDA. HI. HI, LINDA. JOSH, WANT TO GO DOWN TO THE CAR AND GET SOMETHING TO DRINK? NO. I BETTER GO GET HIM. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE MOVING HERE FROM SAN FRANCISCO. YEAH. I MET KEN WHEN HE WAS UP THERE ON A BUSINESS TRIP. THE TRAPS I'VE PUT UP HAVEN'T TURNED UP ANYTHING. "COULD BE?" WE'VE BEEN GETTING ALERT BULLETINS FOR A COUPLE YEARS. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT SHOULDN'T WE BE WORRIED? THERE'S AN INFESTATION OVER IN PEYTON. CONSENSUS IS THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE HEADED. I'M THE MAYOR HERE. I'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS LIKE, "JUST WHAT SHOULD WE DO HERE?" I MEAN, TWO KIDS DEAD IS PLENTY. YOU'VE SET TRAPS; THAT'S GOOD. HAVE YOUR LOCAL COMMERCIAL BEEKEEPERS IF THEY NEED TO RE-QUEEN HIVES, DO IT. HOLD BEE DRILLS IN YOUR SCHOOLS. BEE DRILLS? THEY'RE DOING IT ALL OVER THE STATE. HERE ARE PAMPHLETS AND FACT SHEETS FROM THE U.S.D.A. AGRICULTURE EXTENSION SERVICES. POST THEM AT YOUR LOCAL BANK OR ANYPLACE TOWNSPEOPLE SEE THEM. THAT'S IT? THAT'S THE GOVERNMENT'S "AFRICANIZED HONEY BEE DRAFT ACTION PLAN." IF THERE'S ANY MORE SIGHTINGS LIKE THE LAST ONE PLEASE GIVE US A JINGLE. ( sighs ) YOU READY FOR THE LATEST NEWS? I JUST HEARD THAT KILLER BEES COME INTO AN AREA AND THEY MATE WITH THE LOCAL BEES AND PRETTY SOON, ALL OF THEM ARE KILLER BEES. IT'S GREAT, HUH? WELL, THEN, WHY DON'T WE JUST GET RID OF THEM ALL AND START OVER? WE NEED BEES, DARLIN'. 80% OF THE AVERAGE AMERICAN DIET IS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON CROPS POLLINATED BY BEES. THAT IS AN INDISPUTABLE FACT. HONEYBEES IN THE U.S. POLLINATE CROPS WORTH $10 BILLION A YEAR. THAT IS BA-BILLION-- WITH THE "B." THEY ALSO PRODUCE IN THEIR SPARE TIME $150 MILLION WORTH OF HONEY. WHO ARE YOU? OH... I'M JUST ANOTHER BUG WATCHER. THE NAME IS BEAUCHAMP. ( sniffs ) PREWITT TAYLOR BEAUCHAMP. BUT FOR SOME REASON, THE BEES-- THEY LIKE TO CALL ME "CHIP." ( buzzing ) OOH... ( chuckling ) BEATS THE HELL OUT OF A CUP OF COFFEE FOR KEEPING YOU ALERT. ( sniffs ) MMM... OH, WAIT A MINUTE. THANK YOU, DARLIN'. THE HAPPY VARIETY OF BEES WE'VE ALWAYS HAD IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE APIS MELLIFERA. THE OTHER GUYS ARE CALLED APIS MELLIFERA SCUTELLATA. FOR SOME REASON, I ALWAYS THINK OF THEM AS THE SHARKS AND THE JETS, WITH THE SCUTELLATA SINGING, "I WANT TO LIVE IN AMERICA." WHO DID YOU SAY YOU WORK FOR, AGAIN? UH, WELL, CURRENTLY, I AM NOT WORKING FOR ANYBODY. THE MAINSTREAM AND I DIDN'T SEE PARTICULARLY EYE TO EYE. BUT I HAVE WORKED THE CIRCUIT-- YOU KNOW, BELTSVILLE, TEXAS A & M, CARL HAYDEN. WHY DID YOU STICK AROUND OUT THERE ON THE INTERSTATE WELL, I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT YOUR BEE PROBLEM IS FINISHED. BEES... THEY DO THIS THING CALLED SWARMING. IT'S WHERE PART OF THE PRIMARY COLONY BREAKS OFF TO LOOK FOR A NEW HOME. NOW, TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY FOR THE HAUL, THEY ENGORGE THEMSELVES WITH HONEY BEFORE HITTING THE ROAD. THE BEES I OBSERVED ON THE INTERSTATE WERE STILL PRETTY FAT AND SASSY-- MEANING THEY HADN'T TRAVELED ALL THAT FAR FROM THE PRIMARY COLONY, MEANING, MOST LIKELY THAT THE PRIMARY COLONY IS OUT THERE SOMEWHERE NOT TOO FAR AWAY. I'VE BEEN KEEPING BEES FOR OVER 30 YEARS AS A HOBBY. I THINK THIS KILLER BEE BUSINESS IS SLOP. YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN, CAPTAIN. IF YOU WANT TO IGNORE THE LIGHTHOUSE AND KEEP STEERING YOUR BOAT TOWARDS THE ROCKS, THAT'S YOUR DECISION. YOU COULD PROBABLY WITHSTAND A PRETTY SIZEABLE ATTACK... MAYBE. UNLESS YOU'RE ONE OF THE UNLUCKY ONE IN 200 THAT HAPPENS TO BE ALLERGIC. NOW, LITTLE KIDS, OLDER PEOPLE-- AS FEW AS FIVE BEE STINGS COULD SET OFF AN ATTACK OF ANAPHYLAXIS-- SHORTENING OF BREATH, FALLING BLOOD PRESSURE-- ULTIMATELY LEADING TO CIRCULATORY AND RESPIRATORY COLLAPSE. COULD YOU PASS ME THAT PEPPER, PLEASE? IT'S STILL JUST A LITTLE BEE STING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT "JUST A LITTLE BEE STING" REALLY IS? THE STING ITSELF IS MADE UP OF TWO ULTRASHARP BARBED BLADES SURROUNDED BY PROTECTIVE PLATES AND HARD MUSCLE ALL ATTACHED TO A SAC THAT IS FILLED WITH VENOM. NOW, WHEN A BEE STINGS YOU THESE BARBED BLADES SCISSOR THEIR WAY INTO YOUR FLESH. THAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU FEEL BUT IT CERTAINLY ISN'T THE LAST, BECAUSE NEXT THE BARBS ON THE BLADE-- THEY KIND OF DIG IN-- YOU KNOW, SO THAT EVEN WHILE THE BEE TAKES OFF THE STING IS LEFT BEHIND, ANCHORED IN YOUR FLESH. I MEAN, THE BEE IS LONG GONE BUT THE STING IS NOT FINISHED. IT CONTINUES TO THROB. IT CONTINUES PUMPING PAIN-INDUCING VENOM INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM. IS IT FINISHED NOW? BECAUSE THE STING IS ALSO GIVING OFF THIS ALARM ODOR SIGNALING OTHER BEES THAT YOU ARE THE ENEMY, MORE BEES ATTACK, MORE VENOM IS DELIVERED, MORE ALARM ODOR IS RELEASED. THAT PAIN-- OH! IT'S EXCRUCIATING! YOUR BLOODSTREAM'S FILLING UP WITH TOXIC LEVELS OF THEIR POISON AND IF YOU'RE NOT OUT OF THERE BEFORE LONG, YOU ARE DEAD. SO, MY FRIEND THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY "JUST A LITTLE BEE STING." MULTIPLY IT BY THOUSANDS. THAT'S WHY THEY CALL THEM "KILLER BEES." ( buzzing ) Preacher: I CANNOT CONCEIVE OF A MORE BEAUTIFUL DAY TO BRING TOGETHER TWO SUCH WONDERFUL YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE BOND OF HOLY MATRIMONY, HERE AMONG THEIR LOVING FAMILY AND FRIENDS. KENNETH, I'VE KNOWN YOU SINCE YOU WERE THIS HIGH, SO IT IS ESPECIALLY FITTING THAT WE ARE ALL GATHERED HERE ON THE OLIVERTI FAMILY LAND. LINDA AND KENNETH, MAY YOUR LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER ENDURE AS THE EARTH ITSELF ENDURES. IT IS WITH ABIDING JOY THAT I NOW PROCLAIM YOU HUSBAND AND WIFE. ( "The Wedding March" plays ) Man: MY TURN TO KISS THE BRIDE. ( sighs ) I THINK WE ARE IN BIG TROUBLE HERE. ALL THESE FLOWERS? IT'S THE WORLD'S OLDEST WEDDING FORMULA: WHEN THEY SPEND THIS MUCH MONEY ON FLOWERS THE FOOD IS GOING TO SUCK! ENJOYING YOURSELVES? OH, ABSOLUTELY. A BEAUTIFUL CEREMONY, REALLY. CHAD, CAN, UH, I PULL YOU AWAY FOR A SECOND? MM-HMM. MM-HMM. Linda: JOSH, YOU LOOK GREAT, YOU KNOW. YOU LIKE YOUR TUXEDO? YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR DAD. JOSH, THE BAND IS SETTING UP. THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY MUSIC REAL SOON. I WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU WOULD DANCE WITH ME. WILL YOU DANCE WITH ME? NO! GIVE HIM TIME. HE'LL COME AROUND. OH, I HOPE SO. ( band tuning instruments ) ( high-pitched feedback squealing ) ( feedback continues ) ( buzzing ) ( feedback continues ) ( buzzing loudly ) ( playing rock 'n' roll intro ) ( music blasting ) ( buzzing becomes louder ) DAMN! ( screaming ) OW! Man: THEY'RE IN MY SHIRT! ( screaming and yelling ) Woman: GET OFF ME! STOP IT! STOP IT! KEEP MOVING! OH, CHAD. GET ON IN. OH, MY GOD! THEY'RE ON MY LEG! KEEP MOVING! I'M COMING, JOSH! DON'T WORRY! I'M ALMOST THERE! LINDA! EVERYBODY, COME ON! LINDA! JOSH, I'M HERE. YOU'LL BE OKAY. LET'S GO! HURRY UP! COME ON! COME ON. CLOSE THAT DOOR! HURRY UP! COME ON! COME ON! LET'S MOVE! HEY! LOOK AT THIS. Woman: CONSIDERING THE MAGNITUDE OF YESTERDAY'S ATTACK, DOES YOUR DEPARTMENT HAVE ANY SPECIFIC PLAN OF ACTION NOW? THE BEE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED AT THE WEDDING IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT CITIZENS LIVING IN A "BEE RED ZONE" THE FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED QUICKLY AND THERE WERE NO INJURIES. YOU MENTIONED A "BEE RED ZONE." HAD YOUR DEPARTMENT DESIGNATED THIS TOWN A RED ZONE? BASED ON MY REPORT, WE WERE ABOUT TO, YES. I WON'T LIE. THIS VALLEY MAY HAVE ONE SERIOUS INFESTATION THE PROBLEM IS IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO SET 'EM OFF. I MEAN, THE SLIGHTEST MOTION, VIBRATION... THEY PARTICULARLY HATE LOUD NOISES. OH, AND ODORS... STRONG PERFUMES, EVEN B.O. DO YOU REALIZE WHEN A BEE DELIVERS HIS STING-- WHAM! THAT IS IT. HE IS HISTORY. BUT THEY'RE STILL WILLING TO ATTACK BY THE THOUSANDS-- OR TENS OF THOUSANDS. AN ARMY MADE UP OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WARRIORS WILLING TO DIE TO ELIMINATE THE ENEMY... ( chuckles ) NAMELY, YOU. THINK ABOUT IT. ( chuckles ) HELLO. OH, HI. HOW ARE YOU? ( children squealing playfully ) Woman: THIS IS A BEE DRILL! QUIET DOWN NOW. ( children yelling ) GO INSIDE. HEY, JOHN. I THOUGHT YOU'D BE GONE BY NOW. THE EXTRA PROTECTION YOU WANTED-- THE WINDOW SCREENS, THE NETTING-- THEY'RE OUT OF 'EM. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU DOING THIS. KAREN IS GETTING A LITTLE NERVOUS. HOW BAD DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE? YOU WERE AT THE WEDDING. THAT'S WHAT THESE BEES ARE LIKE. IT DON'T TAKE MUCH TO SET 'EM OFF. THE THING THEY DO THAT I DON'T LIKE IT'S CALLED "DISTURBANCE ABSCONDING." WHAT'S THAT? IF A COLONY GETS DISTURBED BAD ENOUGH THE WHOLE THING WILL JUST UP AND TAKE OFF IN A HUGE MASS AND GO LOOKING FOR A NEW HOME. I GOT THIS STUFF-- SOMETHING FOR YOU AND THE GUYS TO HAVE OUT HERE... UH-HUH. JUST IN CASE. DID YOU TALK WITH THAT PICKER CREW BOSS ABOUT SEEING THE GROVE? HE'S COMING OUT THIS AFTERNOON. I WAS HOPING THAT YOU OR THE MISSUS CAN DRIVE HIM OUT FOR A LOOK. SURE. GREAT. Man: There's no use denying it. The deadly migration of killer bees is upon us and officials say instead of slowing down the infestation is actually speeding up. No place is this more evident than in Blossom Meadow. Here again is the amateur video of the bee attack that occurred yesterday at an outdoor wedding there. The venom from killer bees is not any more poisonous than domestic bees. Killer bees are so defensive that if you disturb their colony they'll come after you in very large numbers, and all victims can do is run. Once killer bees invade a commercial hive... AREN'T THEY SICK OF SHOWING THAT YET? THEY'VE PLAYED IT ON EVERY CHANNEL LIKE SIX ZILLION TIMES ALREADY. WELL, I WISH I'D BEEN THERE WITH A STINKIN' FLAMETHROWER. I HEARD BOB DRAKE GOT $5,000 FOR SELLING THAT VIDEO TO THE NEWS. IT WAS MORE LIKE 500. THAT'S NOT WHAT DANNY OLSON SAYS. YEAH. EXAGGERATE A LITTLE MORE. YOU SAW HOW THEY ATTACKED LITTLE JOSHUA YESTERDAY. WHAT IF... WHAT IF THAT HAD BEEN... DON'T. YOU WEREN'T AT SCHOOL TODAY. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS BEE DRILL. EVERY SECOND GRADER IS GOING TO BE SLEEPING IN MOMMY AND DADDY'S BED. HEY, WE USED TO HAVE DROP DRILLS BECAUSE OF THE H-BOMB. DON'T THINK THAT DIDN'T SCARE THE GRAHAM CRACKERS OUT OF YOU. EXACTLY. OH, CHAD, I'VE GOT ONE OF MY REALLY BAD FEELINGS ABOUT ALL OF THIS. RIGHT HERE IN THE PIT OF MY STOMACH. LIKE YOUR MOTHER USED TO GET. SHE GOT THIS FEELING ONCE-- STOPPED MY DAD FROM GOING ON A BUSINESS TRIP. THE PLANE HE WAS SUPPOSED... ...TO BE ON ENDED UP LANDING ON ITS BELLY ON A RUNWAY FULL OF FOAM. I KNOW THE STORY. LISTEN, KANSAS HAS TORNADOES. LOS ANGELES HAS EARTHQUAKES. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE WE GO, THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOMETHING. WE ARE MORTGAGED TO THE EYEBALLS. EVEN IF WE WANTED TO SELL WE'D HAVE TO DISCLOSE ABOUT THE BEES. WHO'S GOING TO BUY? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE WE SHOULD GO TO A HOTEL OUT OF THE VALLEY UNTIL THEY FIND THE MAIN COLONY. PRIMARY COLONY. PRIMARY COLONY. ( horn honks ) I GUESS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS VACATION FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS. WE'RE GOING TO GO STAY WITH MY MOTHER IN MARIN. WHAT ABOUT YOUR PLACE? I GOT SEVERAL AFRICANIZED QUEENS IN MY HIVES. THAT'S WHY THEY ATTACKED. UNTIL THE AUTHORITIES FIND THE COLONY, THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO. I'LL COME BACK IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. SEE WHERE IT STANDS. YOU'D CONSIDER LEAVING YOUR PROPERTY? ( engine starts ) THOSE DAMN BEES ARE SCREWING UP EVERYBODY. IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE BEE EXPERT IS TAKING HIS FAMILY OUT OF HERE TOUT DE SUITE, YOU MAYBE WANT TO GO INSIDE AND HAVE THAT LAST CONVERSATION ALL OVER AGAIN? OKAY, OKAY. I'LL PACK LUCY, YOU AND ME. KEVIN AND TRACY CAN PACK THEMSELVES. KEVIN WENT OFF WITH TOM SOMEWHERE. I'LL JUST PUT SOME THINGS IN A BAG FOR HIM. THE GARAGE SAID YOUR CAR WILL BE READY BY 5:00. WE'LL PICK IT UP AND LEAVE FROM THERE. JUST ENOUGH FOR ONE WEEK, TILL THE BEE PEOPLE GET THINGS UNDER CONTROL. ( horn honks ) IT'S THAT CREW BOSS JOHN TOLD US ABOUT. I'M SUPPOSED TO SHOW HIM THE ORCHARD. IT'S OKAY. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. IF I LET HIM GO NOW, WE'LL NEVER GET HIM BACK. I KNOW. THE PIT OF YOUR STOMACH. IT'S WORKING OVERTIME, RIGHT? DON'T WORRY. WE'VE GOT UNDER... JUST UNDER 34 1/2 ACRES. IT'S NOT A BIG ORCHARD, BUT WE EXPECT 1200, 1500 CRATES. MY GOD. MY GOD, THAT'S LESS THAN A HALF MILE FROM MY HOME. QUICK. I'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO THE HOUSE. QUICK. WHOA. DUDE, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT FOR? MY GRANDFATHER SNUCK IT TO ME WHEN I WAS 13. I GOT TO HIDE IT SO MY CRAZY OLD MAN DON'T SELL IT OR SOMETHING. YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION. WHAT THE HELL IS IT FOR? PROTECTION, BRO', JUST PROTECTION. HE SAID HE HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT IN HIS 30 YEARS WORKING IN ORCHARDS. IS IT THE PRIMARY COLONY? LOOKED LIKE EVERY BEE ON THE PLANET. I'D HATE TO THINK THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE MORE PRIMARY. ( buzzing ) TOMMY, NO! TRAVIS... KRISTYN... THIS IS FOR YOU. NO! NO! NO! TOM, COME ON! WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE NOW! NO, DON'T PUT ME ON HOLD AGAIN. WELL, PULL THE CHIEF OUT OF HIS MEETING. YES, I THINK YOU'LL FIND THIS VERY IMPORTANT. ( horn honking ) ( honking ) ( buzzing ) GET INSIDE! COME ON! ( pattering ) WELL, WHAT IS EVERYONE'S PROBLEM? ( pattering continues ) MOMMY, WHAT'S THAT SOUND? OH, MY GOD. WHAT IS IT? Kevin: LOOK AT THEM. Tracy: WHAT ARE THEY DOING? THEY WERE AFTER TOMMY. IT'S OKAY, BABY. SHH! EVERYBODY STAY CALM. JUST STAY CALM. EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. DAD, THEY'RE GETTING IN THE HOUSE. OW! GIVE ME THE NAPKIN. Kevin: RIGHT HERE. MOM, LOOK. Chad: WE GOT TO CHECK THE HOUSE. MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS SEALED TIGHT. KEVIN, TOM, GO UPSTAIRS. TRACY, THE KITCHEN. WHAT ABOUT THE ONES THAT JUST GOT IN? A FEW DISORIENTED BEES WON'T HURT US. WE'LL GET THEM WITH BUG SPRAY. WE'VE GOT TO KEEP OUT THE SWARM. WE GOT TO CALL SOMEBODY. WHO? ANYBODY. COME ON! Tracy: MOM? MOM? Tracy: HOW DID THEY GET IN THERE? THE VENT. OKAY, NOW, COME ON, HELP ME. COME ON. HERE. START SPRAYING THEM WITH THIS. KEVIN, I DIDN'T MEAN FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. JUST KEEP SEALING STUFF UP, OKAY? COME ON, TINA-DOLL. COME ON, TINA-BEAR. I'LL PROTECT YOU. MOM? I JUST DID YOU AND MOM'S ROOM. WE ALREADY DID MY ROOM. GOOD. I DID THE OTHER SIDE. LET'S CHECK ON YOUR MOTHER-- ( Lucy shrieks ) LUCY. ( Lucy shrieks ) MOMMY! OH, NO! LUCY! HELP! I'LL GET HER. TINA! TINA! OH! Karen: BABY! OH, LOOK AT ALL THE STINGS! MORE THAN FIVE OR SIX STINGS ON A CHILD LUCY'S SIZE... ( gasping ) THE... THE SHOTS, THE BEE STUFF. UPSTAIRS. Chad: HOLD ON, HONEY. MOM'S GETTING YOUR MEDICINE. COME ON. ( moaning ) HANG IN THERE, SWEET PEA. HANG IN THERE. MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, MOVE. ( wheezing ) ( wheezing continues ) COME ON. ( wheezing subsides ) ( both sighing ) NO. JUST LET HER REST. WHO'S COMING? - NO ONE. - WHAT?! THE PHONE'S DEAD. GREAT. IF THEY'RE COVERING THE HOUSE THEY COULD HAVE GOTTEN IN THE EQUIPMENT AND GUMMED IT UP. CAN THEY BE COVERING THE WHOLE HOUSE? THEY'RE DOING THAT. OH, MY GOD. YOU'VE BEEN STUNG TOO? THIS IS REALLY TOTALLY NUTS. LISTEN, THEY'RE NOT MAN-EATERS. THEY'RE JUST BEES. SOMETHING DISTURBED THEM, THAT'S ALL. PRETTY SOON THEY'LL GET BORED AND THEY'LL GO AWAY. CAN YOU GET THEM TO PUT THAT IN WRITING? ( Lucy wheezing ) - OH, GOD. - STAY HERE. WHY? WHERE ARE YOU...? Tracy: YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO MY SISTER?! YOU SHOT AT THEIR HIVES, YOU IDIOT! ARE YOU TOTALLY BRAIN-DEAD?! DID YOU SEE WHAT THEY DID TO MY SISTER IN THERE?! SHH! SHE SEEMS TO BE FINE NOW. THEY'RE GOING TO GO AWAY, AREN'T THEY, DADDY? SURE THEY ARE, HONEY, BUT WE'RE NOT WAITING AROUND FOR THAT. IT'S HARD TO TELL. Chad: THEY MAY BE JUST CLINGING TO THE WALLS. IF WE CAN JUST GET PAST THE HOUSE, MAYBE WE CAN SLIP INTO MY JEEP. DAD... I'M JUST GOING TO SEE HOW BAD IT REALLY IS. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, THEN WE CAN ALL GO. ( gasps ) OH. CHAD! CHAD! ( wheezing ) WE ONLY HAD TWO SHOTS. THAT WAS THE LAST ONE. ( wheezing ) IF SHE NEEDS MORE, I... I'VE GOT TO GET HER TO A DOCTOR. DAD, COME ON. HOW? YOU CAN'T GO OUTSIDE. ( sighing ) I'M GOING TO HAVE TO. ( wheezing ) JUST HANG IN THERE, PUMPKIN. MOMMY AND DADDY ARE GOING TO MAKE IT BETTER. I'LL GET HER TO THE HOSPITAL, AND THEN GO TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND COME BACK FOR THE REST OF YOU. - MORE SOCKS. - GREAT. RUBBER BOOTS, WORK GLOVES AND DUCT TAPE. WHAT PAIR DO YOU WANT? Chad: UH, UH... THE LEATHER ONES. I HAVE TO MOVE MY FINGERS. YOU NEED SOMETHING TO COVER YOUR FACE. CHEESECLOTH. UTILITY DRAWER. THESE ARE WAY TOO THIN. MY PARKA WITH THE HOOD. IN THE ATTIC WITH OUR WINTER CLOTHES. RIGHT. ( gasping and coughing ) OH, GOD. OH, GOD. ( gasping ) ( gasping ) OH MY GOD. SHE'LL NEVER MAKE IT TO THE HOSPITAL. SHE NEEDS A SHOT NOW. THE SHACK IN THE ORCHARD-- I PUT SOME KITS OUT THERE FOR THE GUYS. I CAN BE BACK IN LESS THAN TWO MINUTES. DAD? DAD? THEY'RE IN THE ATTIC. WHAT? SEAL IT OFF. THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. ANY WAY YOU CAN, SEAL IT OFF. TRACY, THE CHEESECLOTH. TOM. COME HERE. WHAT? THE BEES ARE IN THE ATTIC. IF THE BEES ARE IN THE ATTIC, THEY CAN GET DOWN INTO THE WALLS, AND ONCE THEY'RE IN THE WALLS THAT MEANS THEY'RE IN THE HOUSE-- ALL OF IT, AND WE'VE GOT TO STOP THEM NOW. WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOUR FOLKS, MAN? I MEAN, SHOULDN'T THEY KNOW? THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT BUSY RIGHT NOW. COME ON. ( wheezing ) OKAY. OKAY, THAT'S FINE. NOW STAY BACK FROM THE DOOR, OKAY? CHAD! WHAT? YOUR CAR KEYS. ( gasping ) IT'S THE ADAPTOR I USED TO FILL MY WATERBED. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH ALL THIS STUFF? JUST DO IT, OKAY? WHAT'S HE DOING, HONEY? HE MADE IT. HE'S IN THE JEEP. ( starter motor cranking ) COME ON! ( starter cranking ) OH, MY GOD. IT WON'T START. COME ON! - YOU READY? - YEAH. WHATEVER YOU DO, JUST KEEP FEEDING ME THE HOSE. I GOT YOU. ALL RIGHT. ( alarm beeping ) COME ON! COME ON! ( beeping ) TOM, GIVE ME SOME MORE HOSE! MORE HOSE! TOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I NEED MORE HOSE! YEAH! ( engine revving ) IT STARTED. TOM, WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU? COME ON! KEVIN? KEVIN? KEEP AN EYE ON HER. I HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT WAS. MOM? I THINK SHE STOPPED BREATHING COMPLETELY. LUCY..? LUCY. OPEN THE DOOR!
