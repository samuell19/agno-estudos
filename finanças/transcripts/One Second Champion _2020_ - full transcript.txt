It's just a casual match You people from Ying Ngai are useless Like father like son Just close your gym down Anyone from Ying Ngai?

I'll go this way Hey You guys ever heard of One Second Wonder One Second Wonder Tails Thirty times in a row Dead for a second when you were born Would that have changed your brain? Have you ever had a check-up? Why didn't you utilize this talent? I thought one second wasn't enough for anything Hey, one whole second How many combos can you throw in one second? You can turn the tide This guy Joe Can throw six punches in a second I kinda see that But he's so fast You can't dodge even if you could see it Showing off your coin-tossing trick again I'll give him a hand Brother Dee What? Check this out, this is my dad Your one-second power finally comes to good use You can't box forever You're right, what you gonna do then? Think about it, twenty years later When you look back All that One Second Wonder could do Was to trick people in drinking games And that's the peak of your life Save it When you were little You said you wanted to build a name for uncle's gym If you really wanted that It can be achieved without entering the ring yourself Right? You got my rent Hire him First thing first You'll waive my rent when you start having students Hey I wanna say... Are you interested in boxing for Ying Ngai? I can't pay you much But we can build a reputation together All we need are students Yeung is pretty good 22 fight winning streak I know he always wanted to face Joe I know Yeung He could be a good opponent But, Joe versus Yeung Doesn't sound gimmicky enough Since when did boxing rely on gimmicks? We can do without it You versus Yeung But if you were the sponsor How much would you pay? You? How much would you pay? You guys? How much? I'll go practice Ten years ago There was a teenage boy Who got beaten down in an alleyway I wanted to help People said I was looking for trouble Who gave him shelter? Who fed him? And made him a champion? I just want a real fight Think about it If you were to challenge the world champion Who would care? Think further The exhibition match can boost your popularity A major shareholder withdrew last month We need resources To help you go further Don't be afraid You won so many matches in the past few months Don't panic and keep your composure Just go with your usual flow The first amateur match, let's go! In the red corner is Chow Tin-yan Coach Lai, this stance has a name It's called a Philly Shell Yeah But now in the league Only top boxers With excellent speed and skill Would dare to use this stance Not sure if Chow has got what it takes To knock down his opponent I'll tailor-make a new tactic For your one-second power Drop one arm Stop using both arms for defending Turn your body Minimize your exposure Widen your gaze Unleash your one-second power White corner My dad said You shouldn't focus on the upper body only Footwork is crucial too Remember, push with your toes Don't stay flat footed Keep hopping, keep it loose Sharper the dodge, the better you box Look at your opponent No matter what, fix your eyes on him Chow Tin-yan from Ying Ngai Boxing He's recognized as the One Second Wonder from years ago Who could see one second ahead Can't tell if it is true But you see his dodging reflex is razor-sharp Don't go head to head, keep your distance Cut in from a new angle White corner Ain't your dad awesome? Keep pushing! One, two, one, two, hook Hello, Ying Ngai Boxing Come and check it out My gym is nearby, come by and see Hey, your hearing aid dropped How could you let your kid be a bully? Don't let me see your kid pick on others again Stay focus Inhale Exhale How come I never saw your mom? She's gone Sorry... She left with some guy Is this Ying Ngai Boxing? Yes! Welcome! "Class fee from Ying Ngai" Ho ho ha ha ha I can't finish it, help me eat You need more protein Why do you teach people how to smile? Yet you act cool at times My face needs to rest Drink less "I paid you back, check your account balance" "You owed me, stop bragging" Help me adjust Further To the right Beat him! Beat him! Two rounds have gone by Sung Ngo-yeung couldn't even land a single strike Yeah, just take look at Yan's recent record He's on a ten fight-win streak with ten KOs On the other hand, Sung "Heavy Hammer" Ngo-yeung Has twenty-two wins, eighteen KOs But yet to find a way to deal with this newcomer No matter how I throw my punches He'd be able to see it coming Impossible White corner One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Thank you, thank you Ying Ngai, Ying Ngai Thank you, thank you "Medical Check-Up" Our topic of the day is... How can you dodge so quickly? Why would I tell you if I have foresight power? Does superpower really exist? Once known as the One-Second Wonder Chow Tin-yan is now the One Second Champion Some say he can dodge any punches thrown at him Becoming the new favorite of the boxing league Yan, what inspired you to use this power in boxing? I didn't think too much of it I always thought this power was useless Until I met my coach, Shun Yeah, it's me Ying Ngai Boxing is dedicated to discovering new talents Our gym is in Tai Po Doctor, can this sort of power be proven scientifically? We ran a brain wave test on Mr. Chow yesterday The result is astonishing Normally brain wave is a single clear line With different frequencies However this time we discovered double brain waves A shocking discovery in the medical field Son A TV show can't prove nothing And even if it did, it's just pure talent Uncle Choi It's been scientifically proven that He's not normal I agree with Yeung I was one of the judges of his match once I knew he didn't do this on reflexes alone If that's the case Shouldn't we take some time to consider How we should regulate boxers' eligibilities? You just lost one bout Not necessary to revoke his license This isn't about the result It's about our reputation, about what's fair According to the AIBA Technical Rules If one's nervous system can't function properly The association has the right to stop this boxer from fighting Hey This rule is set to protect the disables And to keep them away from injuries This rule is set to assure the match will be conducted fairly I fight with what I was born with How's that not fair? We have the signatures from serveral boxers Who unanimously agreed To suspend your qualification No one will fight you Even if you try I'll suggest a fair solution If you can provide a detailed medical report To prove that your brain is back to normal We'll allow you to fight again They're just jealous Twisting the rules Thank you No problem, see you next time Give me a pen and paper Can you really tell what's written on this paper? Before I flip it What do you want? Try it Just one second ahead Prove it Joe Wanna have a chat? Instant-Killer Joe, Cheng Yiu-jo from Hunter Boxing Versus One Second Champion Chow Tin-yan from Ying Ngai I know everyone is excited about this game Should you have any questions, please ask away Yan, if you can foresee Joe's next move Don't you think it's an easy game for you? When I'm in the ring It's all about the reflex Joe, you killed your last opponent Would you hold back this time? A real boxer won't play on gimmick or superpower If you're not serious in the ring You'll pay for it Come on man, get her some food Stop meddling, eat your shrimp I'm full, help me finish You're drinking again You want one? You really think your power... I don't know But I have faith There's a chance Wow Did you know what I was going to say? Instincts, just instincts But if I wanted to use my power to listen That would work, too I just don't do that very often Why? Things I don't like hearing I don't want to hear it again Why do you look so... Unhappy all the time? Ever heard of... Parallel universe Parallel universe? It's funny I keep fantasizing about... There is another world With another Yiu She was never abandoned by her dad Never got cheated on Never had to leave Taiwan Never had to use laughter yoga To pretend to be happy She would just be genuinely happy, isn't that great? I always wondered how Seeing what happens one second later Would affect my decisions That's more than enough to change the future For example, a jab Coming right at me I dodge Then the me who could dodge And the me who couldn't Aren't they what you have just described Living in two parallel universes Every second Every choice Can create a new universe Let's hope Yiu in another universe Will finally be genuinely happy You like it? Let's get it for you I like the striving Shulk more What's the striving Shulk? Just for you I want a rematch If it wasn't for you I'd be the one fighting Joe Do you know how long I've been waiting for this? Hey calm down Screw your power You know what fairness is? Let go of me, I worked hard for it too So what Let go of him Are you crazy? Wake up... Hello, please, 51 Wan Tau Street There's a car crash come quickly Mr. Chow, you had a severe concussion in the crash We ran tests There's no internal bleeding or hematoma We did a brain wave test As requested Mr. Chow, you're lucky Everything looks normal As for your son He's out of critical stage now But there's still some stasis under the skull He will be unconscious for now And requires hospitalization Meanwhile Please keep him company Please keep fighting Shun The doctor said my brain wave is normal now Maybe my power is gone Anyhow we'll wait until Chi-leung recovers Once upon a time, there's a boy He was born with superpower His world was different than the others But he was scared of the differences Scared of his power He never cherished it Then he had a kid The kid was just like his dad With a different vision than the others No one had faith in him But he had outdone his dad Even though everyone looked down on him He was determined Determined to prove himself Does the accident have an impact on your fight with Joe? Rumor has it that you lost your power, is it true? What are you doing here? Sorry... For you and your son to be in this situation This is all my fault Just leave I saw the news You're quitting the fight? What do you want? I think you should go for it What's up with you? You were the one who told me not to fight You were the one who got my son injured Now you're encouraging me to fight? I didn't want you to fight Because I thought it wasn't fair You don't understand... How hard it is to be a boxer Knowing it's a lost cause Knowing you'll be injured Losing his life He has to keep on going I caused your power to disappear That was all my fault I won't beg for your forgiveness But that's why You can tell the world Why you stepped into the ring Take care Chi-leung? Chi-leung, you're awake? Where's my hearing aid? Am I deaf? No Let me check the hearing aid I... I don't wanna be deaf No... I don't wanna miss your voice! The battery ran out It's okay Oops It's ok it's okay Actually... I hated it when my classmates call me deaf boy I don't wanna pretend I can hear them Why? Why can't I be like other kids? Am I useless? No No You've always been a good boy When you were little I was worried you'd be scared Whenever lightning struck But you weren't You were having fun That's when I know My son is way better than the others Because he's just like his dad They both have superpowers Our superpower is... We'll never give up I'm fighting Joe For my whole life I see one second ahead Yet I kept running away from everything But not this time I wanna prove that I'm more than that one second Okay No more running away We'll do this together Your dodging has improved from all your fights But you were relying on your one-second vision too much Without it now You'd have to improve your muscle memories Three Four Are you good? Joe punches really hard Build endurance, practice, and toughen up One, two, three, four, block! Again! One, two, three, four, block! Two, three, four, five Fourteen Fifteen Thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty Thirty-one Why did you stop? Get him! Again! Up! Dad, are you scared? If you don't answer I'll take off my hearing aid and run Without the hearing aid All I feel is my own heartbeat I won't be scared anymore After eight matches It's time for the grand finale Instant-Killer Joe, Cheng Yiu-jo Versus One Second Champion Chow Tin-yan Complying with the WBO regulations This will be a 10-round bout, three minutes each This contestant Has been in the ring for only half a year 11 fights in his professional career, 11 wins 10 KOs, 1 TKO People called him the One Second Wonder Because he allegedly can foresee one second ahead Now, he uses his power for boxing Thus transformed into One Second Champion! I'm satisfied. Just to be here Be careful up there You could've told me earlier First, Joe's challenger From Ying Ngai Boxing 136lb, One Second Champion Chow Tin-yan Hooray! And, last but not least From Hunter Boxing Instant-Killer Joe Cheng Yiu-Jo, Joe! 23 fights in his professional career, 23 wins 12 KOs, 4 TKOs In the red corner Is Chow Tin-yan In the blue corner Is Joe, Cheng Yiu-jo Calm down, there's nothing to be afraid of Please welcome our referee, Roger Gentlemen, protect yourselves at all times Listen to me and follow my instructions Are we clear? Touch gloves Back to your corner Don't lose your rhythm Remember what you've practiced You've come all this way, finish it! Maintain your rhythm You know how hard it is to land a strike on him, right? I don't care Are you ready? Are you ready? Judge Judge Judge Timer Box Arms up! Arms up! Doesn't Chow always use the Philly Shell stance? Why is he using both arms for defending? This is no game, Joe's last opponent Was fatally injured by him Everyone knows Joe doesn't back away Of course you need to parry But Chow has his one-second vision, right? Meaning he can predict the opponent's next move But I also heard Chow was in a car crash He might not have it anymore Knocked down by Joe This is unusual Does it mean the rumors are true? Or Maybe that the so-called power is just a gimmick Against a masterclass like Joe This will be a real test for Chow Okay? Box Box Stop! Back to the corners! - Hey! - Back to the corners! Are you okay? Can you stand up? Back to your corner first I'm warning you Tossing is against the rules Do it again, and I'll deduct your score Understand? Understand?

Drag out the fight You're doing great, make it a show Box Back to the corners One Two Three Joe is knocked down He got up right away, but according to the record Joe has never been knocked down before He never got knocked down before During the match with Cho Lap-wai Joe injured his ribs The old wound might have gotten hit Yan must've spent a lot of time To study Joe's style Joe threw a right hook With another uppercut His elbow knocked on Chow's canthus The medic is here, let's see if he can continue Are you okay? How many fingers? Four - Can he continue? - Yes You okay? Are you okay? Coach, are you letting him continue? If only I have the power... You're on your own every second in the ring Boxer, can you continue? Can you? - Can you? - Yes Let's go! Box Stop!
