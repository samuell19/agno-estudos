{Cough} {Cough} {Cough} {Cough} {Cough} {Cough} {Cough} Hello ...? You ain't got to hide from me! I'm just looking for a place to bed down for tonight ...! Drop that pitchfork or I'll drop you. Nothing doing! Good thing I ain't feeling to well. I usually don't wait this long without shooting. Don't! Don't! I'm mulling it over. Who the hell are you? My name's "Buck". Okay, Buck, here's my next question: what the hell are you doing coming after me with that pitchfork? That doesn't seem too hospitable. {Cough} I thought you might be one of them! Who's "them"? Okay, never mind. You live here, Buck? I was staying over at the boardinghouse. Ran out of money. Maybe just invested it poorly? I didn't say I ran out of money for hooch. Okay, fine, so you're the town drunk and you live in a barn. Where's everybody else? I haven't seen nobody. Nobody? Who's selling you that fire-water? You don't look so good, mister. {Cough} I've had better days. Answer my question. You can try Lottie's. She runs the boardinghouse and the general store. She also nows about patching up bullet holes?? I mind my own business. Good policy. What do you know about patching up bullet holes? Mister? {Cough} Never mind. Pleasure meeting you, Buck. Next time, announce yourself. Might save your life ... Man can't drink in peace around here ... He's coming. {Cough} Can I help you, mister? I may be in need {Cough} of some assistance ... "Croatoan" I'm gonna tell you again, Now ain't the time to be taking in strangers! Look he's my boarder Earl and I can do in it whatever I please.. A man shows up with a gunshot wound, it's a sign of trouble! What was he going to do rob me? There's worse than robbing someone. Well I can handle myself Earl and you know it. Well at least go up there and get his gun off of him before he wakes up. And I'd feel a whole lot better if you let me lock him up somewhere until we get a better idea of who he is. Well he is my boarder right now. Lottie ... He's my boarder, Earl and that's End discussion. Well, when ever he's able then I want him up on his feet and out of here.. And I want you packed up and ready to l eave by the end of the week. I'm not leaving. Why the hell do you even want to stay here? This place is going to be a ghost town by Monday. Well I guess that makes me a ghost. Ya, A stubborn ghost. Get our new friend on his feet and out of here as soon as you can and I mean it. Don't make a sound. Who was that? Earl. Try again. Deputy Earl Whitecastle. Where's the sheriff? Your guess is as good as mine. Earl's acting sheriff for now. Nice to see you up and about. It was touch and go for a while. How long was I out? Four days. You know that gunshot wound was infected. If you'd waited a day or two longer, either you would have had to come off or you'd be residing in a pine box right now. Much obliged, then. Don't mention it. I'm "Lottie". So I hear. You got a name? Does it matter? It matters when I take a lead slug out of you. Don't worry, I ain't someone you need to be troubled by. Right... If that's true, I'm sure you wouldn't have pulled a gun on me. Sorry. The name's "Antrim". Henry Antrim. Well that's better. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Antrim. So who shot you? Apache war party. I was out to the Pecos Valley to the Arizona Territory on a job driving cattle. They must've figured I was by my self.. They killed my horse and I lost 'em in the foothills, but not before one of them got off a lucky shot of. I haven't seen any Apaches in this area for a long time. I Did... How did you find Hell's Heart? Pardon? This town. It's not easy to find. Might explain why it died an untimely death. Any way we don't get strangers here. That's why Whitecastle and everyone is in an uproar. They think you might be some sort of criminal element. "criminal element". I'm just a cow-puncher. Still doesn't explain how you Found this town, It's not even on the map. I just rode in. What's up with all the questions? Curiosity. So you won't mind if I ask a question or two then? Within reason, sure. What's a young miss like yourself doing running the town's general store and boardinghouse? Well in case you haven't noticed. There ant a lot of candidates for the position. Which leads me to my next question: where is everybody else? Well you almost met Whitecastle And some drunk guy named "Buck". Almost forgot about Buck. There's two. How many people do you think we need? It seems like a smaller number compared to that hundred twenty-eight got there on your sign. Well there's a few more. But most of the people packed up and moved out when the silver mine dried up. The town's off the beaten path. You can hear the same story up and down the territory. I guess Some places just die out. But the rest of the town they are all already packed up. heading towards Arizona forming a wagon train. I'm sure they'd let you ride with them. I ride alone. Maybe that's explains how you got attacked by that war party? Maybe. You planning on leaving? As soon as I can. Well, That bullet hole might feel a lot better, but you were fighting off a serious infection. I think I'll be alright. Right,, Unless you want to arrive to Pecos Valley in worse shape than you were when you arrived here, you should rest up. Let me guess, you're the town's sawbones, too? I grew up on a ranch. I learned a thing or two about patching up gunshot wounds. Well I appreciate the concern, but I should be moseying along out of here. Besides your friendly neighborhood lawman wants me on my way. I'm only to happy to oblige him. Right I don't pay much heed in what Whitecastle says and neither should you. I've seen that before. What is that? It's a "wabon-dee". The Apaches painted them over their tents and on their horses. It's either a rabbit, which means "light", or a left hand, which means "protection". They painted them to ward off evil. I thought you said the Apaches don't come around here? They didn't paint it. My father did. Your father's an Apache then? No, he was just superstitious. And once he died I didnt have the heart to paint over it. You hold with that Injun nonsense? I like to hedge my bets. Where are you going? Don't worry, I'll be back momentarily . Hey nice to see you up and around. Easy, partner. My apologies. Hey, after being shot, I don't blame you for being skittish. And who might you be? Lloyd. I'm the town blacksmith. And I also run the stables. Really? You know where I can buy a horse around here, Lloyd? Should've used past tense on that last part. All the horses all got cleared out when the townspeople did. The only way the rest of us are getting out of here is on Stage coach, next week. Exactly how many people are still left around here? About four or Countin' you, five. How many lawmen does your town have? Why you asking so many questions? You don't ask questions, you don't learn. Okay alright, I got a question: who are you? Okay alright, I got a question: who are you? "Bill" ... Antrim. "Bill Antrim"? Henry Antrim. Still a little dizzy from the infection, I suspect. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Antrim. Thanks for the friendly hello Lloyd , One more question. Lottie said you had a Lincoln marshal's badge fell out of your pocket when you hit the floor. It's a memento of the old days. I'm retired. Retired? You're the youngest marshal I ever saw. I'm young for my age. "Young for my age" ...? Rabanne ... I asked not to be disturbed. What do you want to do about McCarty? Nothing, No body leaves Hell's Heart, Especially not him. He's mine. He's got a huge price on his head. The townspeople figure out who he is they might try to get the drop on him ... No bodys going to get the drop on him. Not yet. Mornin'. Mornin', Deputy. You might as well call me "Sheriff". Earl Whitecastle. And I hear you go by "Antrim", is that right? That's what they call me. is it? I was just on my way out of your fine little town ... Sheriff. Anything I can help you with before I leave? I just got finished talking to Lottie at the boardinghouse. She seems to think you're up and about a little early, considering the gravity of that wound. I'm a fast healer. You'd have to be ... .. Especially when you get hit with something like this. What do you think that is Forty-five caliber? I don't know much about bullets, other than they hurt like hell. Well, you're in luck. My father was a gunsmith, so I happen to know about what goes into making a bullet. See, Apaches use rifles, long- range ammunition. They're hunters. This came out of a Colt revolver, More than likely. Fast reflexes, too. You keep that bullet. Consider it a souvenir. You got something you want to ask me? Yes. Misster Antrim.. Who really shot you? I didn't get his name. I was too busy trying not to get killed. We've established your original story is full of what makes the grass grow green, so let's start over. You were being chased by ...? Pardon my rudeness, Deputy, but I'm trying to make to Arizona before nightfall ... On foot? You seem to have a shortage of horses around here. I was all set this morning to see you out of here as fast as you could go. But the more I talk to you, the more I think you should stay a few more days. I'm pretty fast. Before you blink, I'll have two new bullets you can look at. I figured. I believe you have met Lloyd. He's my deputy. In case you haven't noticed, he's also a very nervous fellow. You make any sudden moves, who knows? We might have to make your coffin a head smaller. There. Now, we can have a much more relaxed conversation. I'm not feeling to sociable at the moment. You're not under arrest Mr Antrim I'm just trying to making it a little more safe for all parties involved. Safe for you, maybe. You're the one with all the guns. Like I said earlier , I was on my way out of your little town. And I'll let you head that way, just as soon as I get some answers. I gave you plenty. You gave me lies, Mr. Antrim. A man shows up in my town with a gunshot from a Peacemaker, half- dead, no food, no water, no money and no horse. Seems a might suspicious, don't you think? either way I figure you're a wanted man or you're tracking one. Maybe we should just take him to the jail? They burned the jail down you idiot? "They"? Don't worry about it. Somebody burned down your jail? Maybe I'm the least of your problems? I'm done patronizing you. Whether you're a man with a price on your head or a bounty hunter, you're worth some money to me. I'm gonna need a grub-stake when I leave town. That's what this is all about? Money? You got it Consider yourself a guest of Hell's Heart. You can board up at Lottie's, roam around town free as you want, just so long as you stay in my line of sight. And I don't see you with one of these in your hands. Let's get a move on. Lloyd? I'd hate to shoot money. Yeah? Howdy, Mr. Antrim ... Well, hell, you're the town drunk and the bellhop? They picked me to run up your chow on account of anybody got killed they would miss me. Relax. They took my gun. Besides I don't kill people for no good reason. Ya that's what I told 'em. What's going on around here? I don't follow. Your town started with a hundred or so. Now its down to five or six. And theirs eight graves in the cemetery, I counted. Everybody just took off? Up and left their homes? I should go ... They didn't take my knife. All I know is, the silver mine ran out. Then, the homesteaders ran out. Then, the whiskey ran out. What happened to the sheriff? Whitecastle? No. The real sheriff. That kid's no older than I am. I don't even think he's dry enough behind the ears to be a deputy, but nobody would have put him in charge like that. I don't know! I swear! What the hell do you know? I know I ain't enjoying this conversation too much ... You can go back to your barn, Buck. You got it, chief! And you can put that knife, Mr. Antrim. I think I'll hold onto it. That would be a mistake. Walking into this town-sized dump was a mistake Judging how quick you boys are to pull iron I'd think holding onto this knife was the best thing I've done in a spell. I don't recall giving you a option . Neither do I. I don't want to shoot you. Not til I get a better idea of who you are. You tell me about this place and maybe I'll throw you a bone. You know all you need to know. All right you said I was free to roam.. I'm roaming. Let me amend that. You're free to roam around town so long as the sun's up. It's sunset. And until sunrise, you will staying put in this room.. You know i'm a bit of a night owl. You know it was Lottie's idea to put the sleeping powders in your food. Should've had Lottie cook me up some of that sleepin' food . Dammit ...! Buck!!! What do you want? We aren't going to hurt you, Buck. We're here to help you. Help me with what? Come outside and we'll show you. No way. Times change. Come outside and we'll talk. Have a few drinks. Don't try anything! I got a pitchfork ...! Now, I'm hearing voices ... Whoever you are, I just want you to know, I ain't a part of this! I didn't do any thing! There ain't no need to play around with me ... Damn it! Hello? Hello, Buck. Long time, no see. I know you. You're Sheriff Oakley. Was Sheriff Oakley. I go by another name now. Rabanne. They said you were dead. You and Deputy Willet ... Oh, you mean ... Uriel? Listen ... Sure. Rabanne. I don't want no trouble. I just want to go back to my barn.. See we don't like that barn to much. Somebody painted something bad over the door. You want me to ... wash if off or something? Na, what we want you to do is, stand real still like well we eat you alive. Oh, God! I didn't mean to ... It's all right. Really. This wont hurt a bit. Billy ... Hello? Come out here, Billy. We got something to show you. Hello Billy? In case you were wondering, you're dreaming. Thanks for letting me know. That doesn't mean you're safe, though. I don't care what it means. I'll wake up and figure a way out of this place. You know how many tough scrapes I got out of in my life? You've never been in a "tough scrape" like this one, I assure you. Hello, Billy. Do I know you, partner? We have never met before. I used to be the sheriff here. "Used to be"? I changed. Now, I go by "Rabanne". It's a great story. You want to know another story: in three months, you will die. I get that a lot. Ohh No. But this time, it's true. You will die. Betrayed by a friend. Or an enemy. They'll write stories about your exploits. They'll write songs about you. You'll finally be knocking on heaven's door. Everybody dies ... Not like you. What do you care? We offer you a chance at immortality. There ain't no percentage in living forever. You could be the greatest gunfighter that ever walked the Earth. No bullet could harm you. No rope will hang you. You could go into any bank, any saloon, any train car and take anything you wanted and no one could stop you. All you have to do in return is ... ... Walk into the forest Give us what we want, Billy. Give us what we want. Relax. I was just untying you. Damn, What happened? Well, Earl decided to calm you down with the butt end of his gun. That might explain that big ol' bump on the back of your head. That son-of-a ... Now, now, there's a lady present. Anyway, he tied you up for the night. You mind telling me why? I don't know. I think you do know and i think your in on it. Our friend the deputy told me you drugged my food. I didn't tie you up or drug your food ... I get the sense you're lying. I don't know why he said that. Maybe you should talk to him? You got a gun? Why? Cause im going to need it. Oh you think if I had a gun I would give it to you? I think its about time I need to start evening the odds around here ... Uhh... Mornin', Mr. Antrim. Where's my gun? Sheriff Whitecastle ain't gonna let you have a gun ... He ain't the sheriff. I tend not to argue about semantics. Somebody in this town is gonna start talking straight, or I'm gonna start busting their skull, you got me? What do you want to know? Well, I'd appreciate if you start about what's going at this place. Your guess is as good as mine. I just shoe horses and fix wagon wheels. What do you know about Lottie? How do you mean? Did I stutter? Sorry! I don't know much! Her pa ran the general store and the boardinghouse! He disappeared and Lottie took it over. She don't leave. What do you mean? I mean, she don't leave! She hasn't even walked outside since her old man vanished! She just stays in the store! That don't strike you as odd? Mister, lots of things around here strike me as odd. She talk to strangers? What? A man in black. Strangers. Some one like that? I don't know. Well think hard. I said I don't know! I've had enough of this ... What do you want me to do about that horse ...? You and I need to talk. Now is not the time, Mr. Antrim. What the hells in this sack huh ...? Buck... How in the hell did that happen ...? That's a good question Buck usually, doesn't stray too far from his barn. I found him in yonder building this morning. It could've been a wolf or a mountain lion. I never saw any animal do that to a man. Ya well if he would have stayed put like he was supposed to, it would've never happened. You don't seem to surprised by this. Unless your willing to help me dig his grave, I suggest you go back to Lottie's and stay put. You keep changing the rules, Earl. I thought you said i was allowed to roam freely, so long as I didn't threaten the sanctity of your little kingdom with a knife or a gun or a sharp stick ... You call me "Sheriff" or "Sheriff Whitecastle". Not "Deputy" and sure as hell not "Earl". Do we understand each other, Mr. Antrim? Except "Antrim" isn't your name, either, is it? You go by "Billy" these days, or "Henry"? "Mr. Bonney"? "Billy The Kid"? Hell, I'll answer to just about Anything these days. A Federal marshal from Lincoln came by here a couple of weeks ago, looking for you. Seems like you blasted your way out of prison, stole a badge and posed as a lawman to get this far., you should be dead. By all accounts. Swinging from a rope. How come im still alive, then? I would have let you die in your sleep or shot you but I had to make sure it was you. Im standing right in front of you. Unarmed. Why don't you should shoot me now.. Unless of course, I'm your first? I'll be damned. All this big talk about money and blowing people's heads off, and I'm your first. You sure you don't want to be the one that kills Billy the Kid? Huhh... No. Good. 'Cause this how its gonna play out: I'm going to get my gun, then, I'm getting a horse, and if you're lucky, I won't shoot the lot of you before I hightail it out of here. You wont get very far. I don't care how good you are with a gun. Ya why not? Because they wont let you. Unless you can elaborate on that "they" you keep talking about, I'll keep considering it a bunch of hogwash. "They" did this to Buck. For all I know, you did that to Buck. It's true. Buck didn't follow the rules and he paid the price. You leave town, you'll pay the price... I've gotten out of worse. They know. What do you want to do? This subterfuge is over. Whitecastle and the townspeople are no longer needed. Tonight we feasting. Where did you get that ...? Why? Afraid I'm gonna shoot you? I'm afraid you lost your damn mind. How much do I owe you for everything? Wait, what are you doing? I'm leaving your fine little establishment. Give me the . bill. I like to pay what I owe.. Im sorry... I can't let you leave, Billy. Why not? Well it's almost sunset and you go out there after dark... You won't make it fifty feet. Especially not on foot. Oh, I think I'll be all right. You won't. There's something out there that can take out an entire posse without batting an Thanks for the warning. Now, maybe you can enlighten me about this "something" you people are all het up about? Ever hear about the "Lost Colony"? No. Roanoke Island, Virginia. About three hundred years ago, the entire colony up and vanishes.Every one was gone Nobody knows where they went or why. There where No bodies. No graves. Just ... Gone. They left one word carved in a tree. "Croatoan". "Croatoan". I've seen that word before... Some say it was the colonists telling anyone else who came by where they where going Croatoan Island. Other's say it was a warning. Ya It was written on a sign Out side the forest nearby. I know. The Apaches put it there. And what does that have to do with this place? Well the Croatoan tribe have a legend. Long with the Apaches, the Lakotas, the Sioux ... Has to do with a shape-shifter. Some tribes call it the "manitou". I'm not in the mood for some Injun nonsense ... You asked, now listen. The Eastern tribes all had this communal legend about braves going into the forest chasing an deer or a elk or sometimes, a bear. What happens is they go into the into the forest and that animal turns into something else. And? And when the braves leaves the forest, they become something else. They Aren't men anymore. And you think there's a manitou or whatever you call it in that forest? I don't "think". I know. It wiped out Roanoke Island, and when the settlers came it was forest to move west so it went to the forest and made its nest and birth its cubs. And now any man that enters its forest ... the manitou and its cubs kill and wear its skin. Great, so there's bunch of monsters running around here in dead people's skins? Well, During the day. manitou and its cubs outside the forest can't abide the sun, so they have to wear a man's skin. Once the sun sets ... That's what happened here? Well right after they built this town, the manitou and its cubs Started killing the townspeople. So Sheriff Oakley and his deputy rode into the forest to try and burn them out. They never came back. And how do you know so much about all this? My father. He spent allot time with the Apaches during the war. He knew about the wabon-dee ... But too late. By the time we had that symbols painted up on most of the buildings around town.. It was too late, Most of the towns people where already dead. Including him. You could have hightailed it out of here. The manitou won't let u leave. Anyone who tries to leave dies. Look is that enough? Or are you planning on killing me? You know, you guys could have saved a lot of time and trouble by just telling me what was going on . in the first place Would you have believed us? No.. Do you believe me now? No. I think you guys have a bunch of bears or crazies. Running around acting like monsters. Or maybe you're the crazies. Either way. Look the manitou is real. If you try to leave, it will kill you. I'm Billy the Kid, sweetheart. I ain't afraid of the boogey-man. Hello, Billy. You must be Sheriff Oakley. I was Sheriff Oakley. Now, I go by "Rabanne". I don't care what you go by. What I care about is that you're impeding my progress. So you boys and your fancy duds can get out of my way. Actually, what's going to happen is, Your going to turn around and head back to Hell's Heart. If you know my name, you probably also know what I'm about to do to you. If you must. Im sorry. That shooting iron doesn't have any effect on me. How the hell did you do that? You're not leaving. Why not? If We let you go, you tell somebody about this place, about us, Pretty soon, the entire U.S. Calvary will be camped outside our forest. That's what you're afraid of? That I might tell somebody about the manitou or the skallywagers or whatever you're supposed to be? Forget it. I got my own problems. I wish we could take you on your word, but we can't. You boys don't seem much different from the yahoos back in town. The people of Hell's Heart are scared. We're not. So why don't you turn back or, we'll kill you. What's to stop you from killing me anyway? Remember your dream, Billy? Your Not suppose to die today. Hello, Billy. Do I know you, partner? We have never met before . I used to be the sheriff here. "Used to be"? Ive changed. Now, I go by "Rabanne". That's a great story. You want to know another story: in three months, you will die. I get that allot No. This time, it's true. You will die. Betrayed by a friend. Or an enemy. They'll write stories about your exploits. They'll write songs about you. You'll finally be knocking on heaven's door. Everybody dies ... Not like you. What do you care? We offer you a chance at immortality. There ain't no percentage in living forever. You could be the greatest gunfighter that ever walked the Earth. No bullet could harm you. No rope can hang you. You could go into any bank, any saloon, any train car and take anything you wanted and no one could stop you. All you have to do in return is.. ... walk into the forest Give us what we want, Billy. Give us what we want. My ... dream ...? I'd hate to change your destiny over a little misunderstanding like this, but believe me, I can and I will. So why don't you just turn back around and head back to Hell's Heart. And if you knows what's good for you? You'll stay indoors tonight. Hey! Im not done talking to you yet ...! I'll be damned. Change your mind? I just had a very persuasive argument with your old boss. Oakley? He says his name is "Rabanne". Oh, and he spits out bullets when you shoot him. I'm guessing he's your manitou, and that deputy backing him is his cub. I'm glad you finally believe. I don't. I get the feeling they're planning on some sort of Biblical-sized beat-down tonight. Well, that's it, then! We're all gonna die! Calm down! We're fine, Just as long as we stay inside. They They can't go anywhere that thas that wabon-dee painted over the door. Well, that's an interesting notion, there Deputy. We're gonna wash that little doodle-bug off of the door and let 'em on in. What ...?!? Dang, the sun going down ... Lloyd Where so hungry Lloyd .. So hungry.. Don't be afraid, Lloyd. You and the others have served us well. We want to reward you ... Yeah? How about you just let me go and we'll call it even? Oh, there's a much greater reward in store for you ... Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed by thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven ... give us this day our daily bread ... Sorry to disappoint you, Lloyd, but we're far older than your Bible. Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us ... How about you put down that nasty old book and come play with us? I'm taking off my skin, Lloyd! I'm going to show you my true face! Go away ...!!! You think we should stop him? I think it's too late to stop him. I appreciate your bravado, Billy, But what in God's name are you doing? I'm giving our friends outside a tasty morsel. Everybody's in side, no protection, just waiting to be Somebody's snack. Well, that's a fine plan, hoss. I was wondering how we all were going to end up dying a horrific death. If all goes well, none of us are gonna die. Once there inside, we'll light this place up and burn them alive. Oh well thank you for asking my permission ...! Oh, right. You mind if I save everybody's life? How do we get them to come in here? We stay long enough to entice them. Then we vamoose. And once they figure out we vamoosed, we set this place on fire. Where's your kerosene, Lottie? Look, you can get as mad at me as you want, but I'm gonna need that kerosene. Look if bullets can't kill them, what make's you think fire will? We don't have dynamite do we? We don't, do we? No. The mining company took it with them after the mine closed up. Well, then, fire's the best we got. And what happens if fire doesn't Kill them? This store's all I got. I figure, if the fire doesn't stop them, it'll slow them down long enough for us to get some distance from this place. We get far enough away from this place, they probably won't follow. I don't like your "plan" one bit. No, I expect you wouldn't. You were so keen on having me stay around. Which is strange, because, when I was coming down the stairs the other morning, I heard you telling Lottie you wanted me gone. What changed your tune all of a sudden, Whitecastle? You're crazy. You bet. Another thing I heard you telling Lottie was, all of you were supposed to leave next week. Now, I don't imagine that being possible, seeing as how these hombres are so keen on eating everybody in arm's reach. So what's going on? We made a deal with Rabanne. A deal? They wanted a gunfighter. A killer. I thought they was killers? Only at night. During the day, they have to wear humans. And they're only as strong as the humans they wear. Oakley was a decent gunman, but you, you're a great gunman. If the Manitou wearing you, They becomes unstoppable, day or night. I thought they where unstoppable.. They're planning on moving west. They need a warrior to protect themduring the day, while they'd be vulnerable. And how do you figure into all of this? If we brought you to their forest, they agreed to let us go. That's a raw deal deputy, Beacuase they don't let any body go. You think they want anybody knowing who they are? Seems like you where pretty close to being double crossed Earl.. Seems like you can't even trust monsters anymore. Look nobody's dead yet. You do what I say, when I say it you all might make it out of this. Except for you maybe. I ain't decided whether im gonna shooting you or not.. GIVE US HENRY MCCARTY!!! I appreciate you calling me by name! I'm not asking! It ends here! We want Billy the Kid! Give him to us! Or ...? Lloyd ... Damn. You go out the back and start running. Don't stop to smell the daisies, don't look back. What about you? Okay, you got me! Come on in! I even scrubbed off that Nasty thing you fellas hate so much ... And we are ever so grateful, Mr. MCCARTY You can call me "Billy". I don't see any fire ... That's because I told Billy that a water jug was a can of kerosene. I'm not burning down my father's store! You think they got him? If they wanted him, they got him. We need to split up! Get to a horse and ride off in different directions! You head for Pecos Valley, I'll hightail it to the Texas border! Don't stop til you reach a settlement! Go! Earl ... Leave me alone! Judgment Day has come. You betrayed me, Deputy. I never betrayed you. Au contraire, Earl. You betrayed me when I was Oakley. Remember? You ran away when the other deputies and I got attacked by the manitou. Then you talked to McCarty when you agreed to bring him to us. So what? You weren't going to let us leave any ways. No. But I would at least made your death painless. Come out, Billy! That ain't a wise move, Rabanne! I think I'm gonna stay put! And do what? Starve?
