It's every kid's dream. A snowstorm hits a town so hard that all the roads are completely undriveable. All right, hold on, Mr. Narrator Guy. I'll take it from here. Uh, okay. As he was saying, sometimes a snowstorm is so big that school is canceled for the whole day. It's a surprise vacation, a "get out of class free" card, a magical, fun day where anything can happen. A snow day. And now let's turn it over to Deborah May for traffic and weather together. Hello, Syracuse! Our top story today is that mountain of snow outside your door. You see that darling, wide-eyed girl? That's me, Natalie Brandston, one year ago. Boy, was I cute! And next to me is my charmingly awkward brother, Hal. Undriveable. I mean, I was lucky to get out of my garage before it... But back to me. Why do I look nervous? Because I had a big, old English paper due that day, and I hadn't even started. I am just getting word that due to road closures, all Syracuse schools will be closed... Making today a snow day! A snow day?

Well, here I am one year later, still cute, but unfortunately, no snow. Here's a fun fact. On this exact date last year, Syracuse had a snow day. There's nothing fun about that fact, Deborah. Hal, you got to help me. Winter break is in three days, and I need to get out of school until then. - How come? - To get out of all the tests I refuse to study for! Right now, I have a perfect 70% average. Any dips and it's... Winter school? - Winter school. - Oh, no. Oh, yes. Summer school's even more evil twin. When you leave at the end of the day, it's dark and depressing. And while all the other kids are playing with the things they got for Christmas, you've got homework. Okay, Mom's putting on her second shoe, so we don't have a lot of time. You and your freakish hearing. Yeah, that's my superpower. It's not a superpower. Nobody would go see the movie "Ear Man." Okay, if you don't want my help... No, the world needs Ear Man now, more than ever. Okay, okay, uh... have a stuffed doze. - Doze? - Doze, like nose. And instead of saying the letter M, say the letter B. It'll bake it sound like your doze is clogged with bucus. You're good. Why don't you ever fake sick? Oh, no, I'm just the ideas guy. I don't do so hot with the actual doing. He's got above average hearing and good ideas, but no follow-through. Coming this spring, Ear Man, the anti-action hero. I'd see it. Showtime. Okay. Time for school, guys. Bob, is that you? Who's Bob? Sorry, it's my nose, totally clogged with bucus, which I'm sure you can hear. Sounds pretty bad, huh? Actually, it sounds like somebody's trying to get out of all of her tests the next three days so she doesn't have to go to winter school. Ear Man gets his above average hearing from Ear Mom. Now, that's a movie I'd see. Phew. You'll figure something else out. Good morning, family. - Hey, Dad. - Morning, Dad. I am Cop-o-dile, half cop, half croc, all business. Okay, go steal something, and then I'll bite you in the name of justice. Sorry, Randy, I don't have time to play with you today. Why not? Because like the mighty croc, I'm swamped. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Randy. Did you know that the crocodile releases heat through his mouth because he doesn't have sweat glands? Ugh. It's a fun fact. Do no adults understand the meaning of fun fact? Oh, yes! The spotlight operator for the winter dance recital is sick. With what? Something contagious? I will lick him. It means I get to run the spotlight after school. Why are you so excited about running the spotlight? What? No reason. No, I... I just love the craft... of light... spotting. It's a girl. Oh! Lane. Oh, I seriously think you just shaved a year off of my life. It wasn't going to be a great year. I checked. Ha ha. Here. Oh, thank you. That was lovely, Claire. All right. My dancers on stage can take a break. We're moving on to the nondenominational winter dance. Don't you get bored all alone up here? No way. No, this is like my perfect job. I get to shine a light on the stage, but stay in the shadows. I control the spotlight, but I'm out of it. How poetic. Plus, I can stare at Claire all rehearsal, and it's not weird. How pathetic. Mittens, can you come... No, left. You're on the left. No, you're on the... All right, all right! You're mittens, not gloves! I need a five. Well, as riveting as it is to watch you watch Claire Bonner, I think I saw some paint drying outside. So got to get to that. Hey, you want to grab some food when I'm out of rehearsal? - I do, but first... - shoes. Lift. Who am I? You're my hero. You know, I don't like you being up so high, considering you're, shall we say, less than graceful. I mean, you do tend to fall a lot when... Shh, shh, Claire's talking. She is? Hold on. Hi, TMZ? Hot goss. Claire Bonner is talking. No, I'm 100%... Okay, okay, go watch your paint dry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that is why turtlenecks will never go out of fashion. She makes a compelling argument. Yeah, but all I think about is the poor turtle who had to die to make it. - No, Missy. - Missy, you don't seriously... No, okay, but, like, do you think a turtleneck would hide or accentuate, you know... my short neck? Oh, my gosh! - What? - My whale necklace is gone. Okay, well, where's the last place you remember wearing it? Oh, probably around her neck. - Missy, I worry about you. - No, Missy. Okay, I'm back and I am calm now. So let's take this from the top. I haven't taken that necklace off since my dad got it for me in Barcelona five years ago. Wow, this is like as bad as it gets for incredibly beautiful teenage girls. Yeah! Plus it distracts from, you know... my short neck! - Mm. - Mm. Your neck is perfect. No, you're on the... Hey, what's going on? Oh, uh, sorry, every... ahh! Ugh. There he is. You're lucky this Abominable Snowman costume broke your fall. Let me get a look at you. I think he's having a seizure. Is anyone here a doctor? We're kids! I'm fine. I-'m-I'm fine. All right, out of my way, out of my way. Next of kin, keeper of the will. Nat, what are you doing here? I'm your emergency contact. What are you doing here? I let you out of second period because you said you had a tapeworm. Jen, if you want to send me to Principal Baker, I'd be happy to show him the website where you sell stolen school supplies. Ugh. Hey, why are you my emergency contact and not Mom or Dad? I changed it in the school's computer system so I have an excuse to ditch class every time you do something clutzy and hurt yourself, which... Let's be real, babe, is often. Ha! Truth. Up top. Woo! Natalie Brandston, are you jumping? I let you out of a Spanish test today because you said you had a hernia. Uhh... How many teachers do you have blackmailed? No such thing as blackmail among friends. Natalie Brandston. Ms. Reynolds, to what do I owe the pleasure? Just thought I would remind you of your math test tomorrow. Oh, I wouldn't miss it! I mean, unless a distant relative died suddenly, or I contracted mad cow disease. Listen, I know how you intimidate the other teachers. There's even a Natalie Brandston support group that meets at lunch. But it's not going to work on me. You're taking that test tomorrow. If you fail, I'll see you in winter school. And we'll add, subtract, multiply, and divide until the sun goes down. Why didn't you blackmail Ms. Reynolds? Because I got nothing. Reynolds is mean, but she's clean. You know what I need? - Uh, to study? - Ew! No. I need a snow day. Nat, I don't think we're getting a snow day anytime soon. Rebecca Menderson is officially #Rebeccamending wearing shorts tomorrow. I am officially #Rebeccamending wearing shorts tomorrow. See? Desperate times call for desperate measures. We got to do the snow dance. - The snow dance? - No, we're not doing the snow dance. Aha! I don't think I've ever seen you dance. Well, and that streak shall continue. - Hal, the snow dance works. - No, it doesn't. - It did last year. - Like three weeks later. So? It's not an exact science. It's the exact opposite of science. Ugh! Why can't you be more like Snow Day Hal? - Snow Day Hal? - Yeah, he's like a totally different person on snow days. I mean, last year, you successfully sledded down Dead Sled Hill. Well, true, but that was... And then you entered that snowman building competition and built one that looked so much like JoJo Siwa, it got featured on the news! Yeah, I was proud of Snow Snow Siwa. And then you did a celebratory snow lap around the block in nothing but shorts. Didn't even feel the cold. Yeah, 'cause Snow Day Hal has a whole different vibe. Snow Day Hal is fun and fearless. Well, isn't regular Hal fun and fearless? - Nah. - No. No, there is something freeing about a snow day. Most days, I wake up, I'm like... this again, me again. But on a snow day, oh, you wake up to a... To a blank white canvas just begging you to paint something bold. That was kind of beautiful. Yes, it was gorgeous, stunning, all of the fancy adjectives. Now will you do the snow dance with me already? A snow day would be nice. Everyone's so carefree and happy. And that outdoor skating rink is everything. Do your dance. What, now? Yes! I won't look. ♪ Sha la la la la la ♪ ♪ Sha la la la la la ♪ ♪ Sha la la la la ♪ ♪ Sha la la la la ♪ ♪ La ooh ♪ Hal? Hello? What are you... Ugh! Men. In the mood for shakes and/or cakes?

This Saturday. - Wait, this Saturday? - Uh-oh. - Oh, God. - I call it Caturday. We'll let you two do your thing. Claire Bear, I got Syracuse football tickets Saturday night. What? I didn't know it was that important to you. You didn't know my dance performance was that important to me? Chuck, sometimes I think you don't know me at all. - I know you. - Okay. What is my favorite color? It's, uh, the... The... Teal. Uh... Okay, what food can I not stand? That's easy. It's the s-spaghetti? Uh... - Pickles. - They're pickles! Well, what's my favorite food? - Toast. - Heck yeah it is. Soft and crunchy at the same time. Oh, my gosh. Okay, we're done. Just go. Whoa. Are you seriously breaking up with me because I don't know your favorite color? I don't know what I'm going to do yet, so just go. Fine! Brown. Nobody's favorite color is brown! I think brown is kinda cool. What happened, babe? We heard every word. - Missy, why? - Missy, think before you talk! You should go talk to her. You say that like it's not the most terrifying thing I could possibly imagine. You just need an icebreaker. What's that? After I fell today, I found Claire's missing whale necklace. This is amazing. You have a reason to talk to her. Yeah, but I also have to say words. Well, lucky for you, you have a female best friend and a rather cool one, if I'm being honest. Okay, get to the point. What I, a girl, would want you, a guy, to do right now is walk over, take out that necklace, and say, super cas... "I thought you might be missing this." So what you're telling me is that I have to have swag? Something I've never possessed my whole life. - Precisely. - Ah. - Here, try it on me. - No. Come on. You want to get the girl? You got to do it. Come on, Hal. You got this. Okay, okay. Hey, I, uh... I thought you might be missing this. - Lane. - I'm sorry. What are you doing with your eyebrows? - I don't know. - Well, don't do it. What, don't do this? All right, go get us some cake, swaggy Hal. Oh, it would be swaggy Hal's greatest pleasure. - Ha ha. - Huh huh. Your shirt is so much cuter green. Smile! - Put the phone down. - Missy, timing. Oh, shoot, it's a video. Here's the guy who helped Claire's shirt be better. Say hi, guy. - Missy! - Missy! Ugh! Whatever problems you're having, trust me, mine are 20 times worse. It's just not fair. Math has no practical application in life. Ever heard of a calculator? You know what, I bet if you tried really hard, you could pass that test tomorrow. Yeah. I bet that if you tried really hard, you could run a 30-minute mile. Looks like it's winter school for your old pal Natalie. - Snow dance? - Snow dance! Fee, fi, fum, fo! You and me are gonna make it snow! Woo! We're gonna make it fall onto the floor! Woo! Here we go, here we go! S-N-O-W and me are double trouble Bring it on down, Nat! Bring it on down, Nat! - I'm bringing it down! - Woo! Bring it on down, Nat. Bring it on down, Nat! Woo! Make it snow, bro. Make it snow, bro. Ooh, ooh. Make it snow, bro. Make it snow, bro. Ah, shimmy to the right. And shimmy to the left. And jump until you're out of breath, and jump until you're out of breath, and jump until you're out of breath! Jump until you're out of... breath. Whew! Okay. Now on the off, off chance that that didn't work, you should probably study. First, I gotta find my math book. That's history. Man, I'm surprised you're in such good spirits. Why? Oh, no reason. I mean... Someone took a video of you spilling a milkshake on Claire Bonner that kind of went viral. What? Your shirt is so much cuter green, g-g-green. C-c-cuter. Smile! Sm-sm-smile.

Whoa! In addition to supermarkets and convenience stores, all gas stations are also closed due to last night's unprecedented snowstorm. When I woke up and looked out the window, I thought I was dreaming. I mean, I went to bed in shorts. Nobody asked for your life story, Deborah. Give the people what they want! Oh, and all schools are canceled. Happy snow day! Snow day! Uhh... Daaay! We did it! We did it. Blank canvas. My sign. I'm Snow Day Hal. Welcome, Snow Day Hal! So what's first? Skiing, ice fishing, skiing while ice fishing? Actually, I'm gonna spend today trying to get the girl who's way out of my league and has a boyfriend. That's my swaggy brother. And hey, you have a full day to study for that math test. No, I have a full day to get us a second snow day. And then it's winter break. Okay, well, how do you plan on getting a second snow day? If it stops snowing, these roads are going to get cleared, and that means everything will open back up again tomorrow, including school. Not if I stop the guy who plows the roads. Stop Snowplowman? You know, but he's a maniac. Move it! Get outta the way! I heard he drinks wolf blood before plowing to get into beast mode. And that he ripped the braces off the last kid who tried to stop him and turned them into brass knuckles. Well, lucky for me, I have perfect teeth. Plus, anything can happen on a snow day. Nat, going after Snowplowman is kinda insane. Says the guy who's going after the girl who's way out of his league and has a boyfriend. Take him down, sis. Get the girl, bro. Hey, Hal. If we get a second snow day, wanna spend it together? That's a deal. Hi. Ha. Hello, darling. Eli and Wayne are in the fort. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize Eli had a sister. Oh, Natalie. Die, werewolf, die! I'm losing, Elf Boy! Move! What are you bozos doing? We're playing this marvelous video game wherein one attempts to ward off werewolves whilst building a shack. - It's called Werewolf Shack. - Care to play? - Hey! - Hey! Hey, yourselves! Don't you guys realize that today is no ordinary day? Today's a snow day. That means anything can happen. We can do anything we want. So do you wanna spend the day taking down lame, fake werewolves, or do you wanna spend the day taking down someone scary and real? Like who? Snowplowman. Snowplowman? But he's a maniac. I heard a man once made fun of his snow plow, so he plowed the chap's motorcar. Listen. If we take down Snowplowman, we get a second snow day. No, that's way too dangerous. Well, if we don't try, then you guys won't see me all break, because I'll be in winter school. Nonsense, my queen. I fight with you. Great. You in, Wayne? Does this answer your question? Yeah! Who are we taking down? All: Snowplowman! Freeze! This is Sheriff Randy. You better not steal something, or I got you, babe. Oh, okay. Steal something! Uh, Sheriff, well, I can't. I'm working. But do you believe in play after work? No, it's a snow day, people. Well, it's not a snow day for mommies and daddies. We still have to work. Sorry, bud. Okay. What am I doing with these taxes right here? Oh, uh, Randy, what did I say? I was working, right? Remember, I just said that? You have the right to remain silent. Oh, very funny. But... Bet you wish you could turn back time now. Sheriff, we appreciate... - Sorry. - That you are a musical officer of the law and that we're being no fun, but we really do have to work. So... Ow. If you could take these off, please? Yeah, I mean we have to meet our deadline so that we can make money to buy you, you know, hats and wigs and badges and water guns. Hand over the devices. - No, come on. - Yes. - My computer? - Yes. All right, fine, but that's it. I need to use my phone. And the phones. Come on. All of them. That's all we have. Where was that one? Okay, you have all of our stuff. Now can you please uncuff us? Not until I have the perfect snow day. And first, I want the perfect pancakes. No, w... Kinda hard to do that when you're handcuffed together. Yeah. Then I suppose you'll have to make them together. Oh! Hoo! Ah! Come here! Okay, let's beat the rush to the rink... come on. - Oh, I can't. - Why not? Well, because I'm Snow Day Hal, and I can't let whatever comes over me on a snow day go to waste, so... I'm gonna get Claire. Oh. Hm. - What? - No, nothing, I just... I thought I'd be spending the snow day with my best friend, which is exactly what I'm gonna do, 'cause you need all the help you can get. - You're my hero. - No lies detected. Now, let's see the plan. The plan? Hal, I know you. You have a handwritten plan complete with funny drawings somewhere on you. Let's see it. Fine. Wait, why by sundown? Well, because it's a snow day. When the sun goes down, it'll be a snow night, and that's not a thing. So what's the first step? Wear this really cool sweater? Hey, I like this sweater. Oh ho ho. I'm aware you do. No, first step, make an impression. I'm going to go to her house and hold this up. I don't get it. What? Whale you, like... like will you go out with me? Only it's whale you go out with me because of the whale necklace. Man, I thought that was clear. I'm messing with you. It's whale-y good. Whale-y? Would I say "whale-y" if I didn't whale-y, whale-y mean it? Yeah, okay, that's her house. - Good luck. - Hey, Snow Day Hal doesn't need luck. Yeah. Okay, maybe a little luck. Go, go, go. Claire Bear, I have something to say! What is it, Chuck? Are you going to miss my birthday next year for a toast convention? Look, that Chuck yesterday was old Chuck. This is new Chuck. And new Chuck would drop anything for you. Hmm. Why should I believe you now? If it wasn't clear, I just ripped the Syracuse football game ticket in half. All right, come in. Let's... let's go get some hot chocolate. Your treat, come on. No, no, no, no. Normally, this would be defeat, but not for Snow Day Hal. I could still make an impression. I just gotta, uh... just gotta plan my next move. Well, Chuck's in her house, and you're not. Wait, wait. I'm going to get in her house, too. Wait, Hal, her house is that way. What is your freak... It's just here. - You'll see. - But it's... Anything can happen on a snow day. Wait! Wait! Shoes. Lift. - Okay, quickly. - Yeah. Who am I? You're my hero. Bye! Bye. Okay, guys, if we're going to take down a living monster and get a second snow day, these snowballs got to be packed tight. Fine. Lucky for us, Snowplowman overposts on social media, so I know he's stopping right around here from mid-morning until we break. And I did a few calculations to determine how the wind chill factor might affect the arc of the snowball. Ew, math. We're good. Wayne, you've got a sling for us? Right here. Don't laugh at me. It's my grandma's, okay? It's the best I can do on short notice. Okay. Plan is to distract him with the balls and then jab a hole in one of his tires. Brilliant. Not the way to go if you ask me. We didn't. Fine. Then you won't get to hear my genius idea. Good. Sinkhole. What's a sinkhole? A cavity in the ground caused by erosion. One does not simply create a sinkhole. Not with that attitude. Snowplowman. Snowplowman, pull over! The sunlight is hitting us at an ideal angle, and I would like to suggest taking a commemorative selfie. Great idea, Trudy. You know, they don't make them like you anymore. Actually, they do. I'm a standard artificial intelligence device that you program to remind you to eat, tell you that you're handsome... Hey.

Bull'seye. - Hey, wait! - We've gotta get out of here! Nice try, kiddies. You ain't getting no second snow day. Nothing is a bigger threat to fashion than snow. Ugh! Why can't you just be longer? That's why I'm here to officially #Rebeccamend you start your early afternoon off with a... - Hey, babe. - Butter's in the fridge. Love you. Chuck. Yeah, babe. Make sure the toaster is plugged in. Who's better than you? This way, you're gonna keep warm without having to sacrifice your silhouette. Claire! Claire Bonner! Um, I'm Rebecca, Rebecca Menderson. Uh, yeah, I know, and-and letting me speak for a moment would be my official #Rebeccamendation. That is trademarked! Claire Bonner, hi. My name is... is Hal Brandston. You probably don't know me other than yesterday's milkshake malfunction, but I know you. I know that when you're nervous, you eat candy corn. I know that you hate pickles. And I know that you love to dance more than anything in the world. Okay, yeah, this is- This is great. This is really sweet and all, but I'm going to have to officially #Rebeccamend that you leave immediately, or I'm going to call security. - Security? - Security! Dad! I still think a sinkhole would be way more efficient. I truly don't know how many more times I can tolerate him saying the word "sinkhole." Let's try this first and then revisit sinkhole, okay, buddy? Well, my grandma needs this wig back by 4:00. She's not too happy that I stole her bra either. Snowplowman is about 45 seconds away. How do you know? I took the liberty of adding a tracking device to one of the snowballs you launched. Does this coat make me look boxy? Shh! He's coming. Let's go! Oh, no, is it snowing? My grandma's going to kill me if she finds out I got her hat wet! Just get out there! I'm not taking that test. - Danger! - Aah! - Stop! - Danger! Danger! Danger! Lady! Lady, are you okay? Lady, I'm sorry. Are you hurt? Are you okay? Are you... You ought to be ashamed of yourself! Jeez, you pack some heat right there. Listen, lady, I'm sorry... My name is not lady. My name is Gillie Butler, and I demand respect! Okay, Gillie, sorry. You came out of nowhere. You're lucky I didn't plow you over. Find the keys. Find the keys. Yes, milady. Intruder detected. What is that? I have half a mind to call the police! Hey! All right, let's just put our purses down and leave the feds out of it! I am Trudy, property of the gorgeous snowplowman, who was potty trained at a perfectly appropriate age. I have 13 strong-bodied sons that wouldn't mind teaching you a lesson. All right... 13 sons? Mm-hmm. Wait a second, Gillie. What year were you born? - Oh, 2008. - Nah-yea... - Ow. - You're a kid. Ah ha, ha, ha! You looking for these? - Grab the bird. - With alacrity, madam. Easy, easy. Let's go. You're coming with me. Get over here. No. No. Come on. Come on. - No. - You're coming with me. Yeah, you stupid kids! You think you can trick me, you stupid kid? Get up in there. Go on. Get up. Get up. Wait, where's my... where's the... Trudy. Trudy! Where's... Trudyyyyyyy! Hi, Hal. Ugh! You know, someday I'm gonna surprise you. Oh, I'm sure you will. Can you say that a little less patronizing? I don't think I can. Hey, did you see me on #Rebeccamendations? You definitely made an impression. Then on to step two, humiliate the boyfriend. If you hate him, why did you draw him so handsome? Because he's a gosh darn snack, Lane. I can't deny it any longer. Yeah. Hey, Rebecca Menderson was cool enough to let me know where Chuck and Claire are going. - And? - You're going to love it. It's the ice skating rink? - Ding, ding, ding. - Yes, finally! Here we go. Let's go. - Wait, Hal, shoes! - Oh! Ugh. I'm just... I'm just making a snow angel. I did that totally on purpose. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You know, snow angels are great and all, but they kind of break your heart. How come? Because it's all perfect, but then you ruin it with your handprint when you get up to look at it. Yeah, true. Hey, why do you love ice skating so much? Honestly? Yeah. No. No, you'll think it's dumb. No, I won't. Okay. When I'm ice skating... What? I don't know. Lane, it's just me. Okay, fine. When I'm ice skating, I... I feel... beautiful. Oh, that is dumb. See? I told you... No, it's dumb because you're already beautiful. You're a beautiful girl, Lane, like factually. Here, so you don't ruin your snow angel with your handprint. Perfect. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, just, you know, cold. Oh, well, I know how much you love this sweater. No, no, no, no, no, you'll be colder. Are you crazy? Here. Thanks. - Of course, let's go. - Hal, wait. What? Did-did you do something different with your hair today? Oh, no, I can assure you this mess is whatever it is. Let's go. I'll meet you there. I just got to call home real quick. - Okay. - Okay. ♪ Oh, no ♪ ♪ What's this funny feeling in my chest? ♪ ♪ Like I know there's a different warmth ♪ ♪ For this than friends ♪ ♪ Part of me says fight it ♪ ♪ Part of me secretly likes that ♪ ♪ You see my beauty when I can't ♪ ♪ Okay, I said it out loud to myself ♪ ♪ It doesn't sound so crazy ♪ ♪ Wait, maybe I can't tell ♪ ♪ What if I told him I could be falling? ♪ ♪ I'm thinking what if, what if it it's romance? ♪ ♪ And it's got me wondering ♪ ♪ How does this song end? ♪ ♪ I'm thinking what if ♪ ♪ What if our story has a twist? ♪ ♪ Our story has a twist ♪ ♪ Do I tell him I can't look at him the same? ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'll try ♪ ♪ But suddenly I love the things I hate ♪ ♪ Like all these ugly sweaters ♪ ♪ I will wear them now forever ♪ ♪ Oh, what's happening to me? ♪ ♪ Okay, I said it out loud to myself ♪ ♪ Should I brush it off, or should I tell him ♪ ♪ How I really, really feel? ♪ ♪ What if I told him I could be falling? ♪ ♪ I'm thinking what if, what if it's romance and ♪ ♪ It's got me wondering how does this song end? ♪ ♪ I'm thinking what if, what if, what if ♪ ♪ What if I told him I could be falling? ♪ ♪ I think I'm falling ♪ ♪ It's romantic, whoa ♪ ♪ It's got me wondering, how does this song end? ♪ ♪ I'm thinking what if ♪ ♪ What if our story has a twist? ♪ ♪ I could blurt it out and hope he doesn't laugh ♪ ♪ Because it would hurt to have him ♪ ♪ Write me off like that ♪ ♪ I wish that I could jump ahead ♪ ♪ And read the end ♪ ♪ 'Cause what if our story has a twist? ♪ Too pancakey.

People at work are going to be really mad at Mommy and Daddy. That sounds like a you problem, not a me problem. Oh, I say it on one phone call, and he locks it in. - Hi, Mom and Dad. - Natalie, Natalie! No time to stop and chat! Natalie, sweetie, sweetie! We got a problem here! We're handcuffed together! Randy took those handcuffs, and we're going crazy. It's a nightmare. We are tickety boo. Tickety boo? - Yes, tickety boo. - Tickety boo? We're working here. English, please. It means we're good to go, and it was actually quite English. Whoa! They took my special bird. They took Trudy. Don't answer that! It could be about Trudy. Well, answer it, for God's sake! Wayne Castle. What's your hassle? Hello, Snowplowman. Give me that! Trudy, baby, I miss you. Say, "It's very difficult being apart." It's very difficult, being a fart. - Eli! - Apologies. Apart. It's difficult being apart. Trudy, ask them what they want! I'll give them anything to get you back. Hey, watch the drumsticks! $1 million. Both: What? Worth a shot. Easy, easy. Just kidding. Ha, ha, ha. Bring the boy to the center of town in one hour, or I will tell everyone that you sleep with dollies! Hey, Trudy, that's private, okay? I just made that up. - Hey. - Hi. - Looking good, babe. - Thanks. - Hey. - Hey! Oh, nice. Your friends. Hey, I should get to know them better so I can feel closer to you. I appreciate that, Chuck. What are their names again? Hmm. Mason, Rebecca, and Missy. Oof. Never going to remember those. Hey, you two. - Hey. - You two. All: So... Are Claire and Chuck back together? - Like back-back? - Together-together? Correction, Claire and new Chuck are back together. Well, new Chuck is on probation. New Chuck does not know what that word means. It means you better watch your back. Watch your back. And wash your back even though it's hard to reach. - Missy. - Babe. I use a loofah on a stick. What are you talking about, Claire's friends? We're talking about Hal Brandston. Guys. Who's Hal Brandston? Hal Brandston interrupted my livestream to proclaim his love for Claire while I was officially #Rebeccamending a light pant for the transition from early afternoon to mid-afternoon. Well, I feel like an idiot. Oh, Chuck, come on. I don't even know that guy. No, look at me. I should have gone with a light pant. I'm going to go home and change. - Chuck! - Oh, angry voice. Our cue to exit. I'm hungry. I'm Germany and like an eighth Scotland. Mm-hmm. Oh, hungry, like for food. - Yeah. - I'm on it. - Mm-hmm? - I'm on it. Okay. Okay, he just said he's going to get Claire some food. You ready? I guess. Come on! Hey, you've already done the impossible today. What do you mean? You look cute in the ugly sweater. You're Lane from school. And you're Dirk from school. You know me? Of course I do. Lane, I've always wanted to tell you something... Oh, my God, there's a spider on your shirt! What? Where? I hate spiders! Now it's on your hat! Oh, it's on your apron! Take it off! Take it off! No! No! Did I get it? Oh, no, it crawled off your neck! Run, Dirk, run! Does anyone work here? Some of us have hungry girlfriends. Coming, coming. Sorry for the delay, folks. Nasty pest issue back there. Mm. Mm-mm. - Hey there. - Hey, uh, Dirk. - It's a family name. - Oh. So what do girls, like, eat? Hmm, what do girls, like, eat? Mm, you know, girls are complicated. Right? You know what you can't go wrong with? - What? - A burger with pickles. Pickles? She is going to love it. - You're going to love it. - Oh, I'm starving. What'd you get me? Just trust. Okay. Mm, mm. Does this have pickles? Extra pickles. I hate pickles. I've told you this like a million times. - Dirk. - Who's Dirk? She's the cute girl who works at the food truck. - Cute girl? - Yeah. Okay, that's it. We're done. - Wait, Claire. - Like for real this time. Claire, come on. Claire, you're so much cuter than her. - Ugh! - Are you okay? - What happened? - Where's Chuck going? Whoo! Okay, so I think step two went off without a hitch. Oh, hi! You are amazing! Okay. Time for step three, the grand gesture. This step requires actually talking to her, so excuse me while I panic. Hal, you know you don't have to do this much for a girl to like you. Yes, I do. Trust me, you don't. Regular Hal isn't so bad. I mean, sure, you're a little awkward, but you're also... Do you remember in second grade, we went on the field trip to the zoo? - Oh, the whooping cranes. - Yes! I was so irrationally scared and started freaking out, but before the other kids could make fun of me, you started saying, "Whoop, whoop! I'm a crane! Whoop, whoop!" over and over. That was so embarrassing. So embarrassing. But it distracted everyone from me and also distracted me. You were my hero. Point is, you were enough then, and you're enough now. Hey, Claire. Meet me at the soccer field in an hour? Should I? I mean, he's kind of cute. And it would be a great way to get back at Chuck. Chuck is so hot. Missy, think before you talk. Babe, you need to get with the program. - Okay! - Yes! Oh, God, it's happening. Oh, shoes! Okay, lift. Who am I? You're my hero. Like, for real. Johnny Depp-uty? Oh, yes. Good call, babe. - Very smart. - Thank you. Yeah. Okay, here we go. - Okay. - Three, two, one... flip. 'Ey! Pretty good. That's really good. Hey. I've missed you. I've missed you, too. Do my ears detect nostalgia? Sorry, Johnny Depp-uty. You know what I think we need? No, three kids is enough. I'm thinking we need a little powdered sugar. Oh, you want to go with the powdered sugar? Mm-hmm. Okay, how about there, there, there? No, see, this is how it starts. We're going to get ourselves into trouble. Johnny Depp-uty. Here we go. Your pancakes, sir. Now that is perfectly pancakey! - Ah, yes, yes! - Oh! That's great news. Can you please uncuff us now? First, you gotta catch me! Oh! - Randy! - Randy! Randy. I'm hit! Don't you die on me, soldier! I'm so cold... so cold. Oh! Oh, you're going down, son! Blah. Give me my bird. I'll give you your bird if you promise to stop plowing. Not a chance. Hey. What are you doing? Don't, don't. What... how? Don't you... Why would you hurt her? She's done nothing! Psst, Wayne. Wayne, my boy. Here. What are these for? You're going to cut off the accelerator so the snowplow can't move. He'll be totally stuck here. - Precisely. - Oh! You're smarter than you look. Give me my bird, or you'll never see your friend again. He'll live with me, and I'll make him trim my mom's toenails! Ew. Oh, yeah, they're filthy! It's gross! You know what, Snowplowman? I'm an adorable and precocious young lady with my whole life ahead of me. You, well, you're just an ugly mug with mommy issues who's in love with a toy bird. She has a name! Look, I'll let you win today because I know I win at life. Oh, Trudy. Trudy, did the bad girl hurt you? Gross. It's called love, okay? And you know what, girlie? You're coming with me! No! Hey! - Yeah, you just... - Stranger danger! Get your hands off of me! You're coming with me. You shall not separate me from my queen! Get up in there. I demand that you get your filthy hands off her! Get in there. Come on, let's go! That's right. Oh, Trudy, Trudy. Here you go, baby. Boom, boom! Oh, I'm going to make you three ragamuffins watch while I plow through your dreams of a second snow day. Trudy, start the engine. Starting engine. Let's blow this Popsicle stand. Exiting Popsicle stand. Wayne. Oh, that's the gas pedal. Hey. Hey! What's going on with my brakes? Okay, Hal Brandston. What's going on? Claire. Claire, I... I have spent half my life pining for you. Isn't that ridiculous? I mean, if you feel something wonderful for someone, shouldn't you tell them? So here I am, not just telling you, but showing you. This is my grand gesture. I just... Hopefully, it's not too late. Is it a whale? Yeah. I, um... I thought you might be missing this. Where did you find this? Chuck, don't bother. Wait. I know I messed up. Chuck, no. When I looked up this Hal Brandston clown in the yearbook, he's never even been on a sports team, like not even a fake sport like golf. Now hold on a second. My point is I'm Chuck Wheeler, and you're Claire Bonner. The Chucks and the Claires of the world always end up together. Not on a snow day. What'd you say? - Meet me at the theater. - Okay! You're toast, Brandston! Yeah, you better run! Have you ever driven without brakes before? No! Well, can you drive any slower? [high-pitched No! Well, how much longer until the gas runs out? Oh, about two hours unless we hit a building or fall off a cliff because you won't stop distracting me! I can't believe you cut the brakes. I can't believe you said no to sinkholes! I still say no to sinkholes! All you do is sit there in your huge, stupid, puffy grandma coat saying sinkholes, sinkholes, sinkholes! It's not that huge! A plane could perform an emergency landing on you. Which is exactly what we're going to do. What? Three inches of down under the coat, ten-foot drop. - What are you doing? - Math. Oh, my God, it is useful! Trudy, how fast are we traveling? 41 miles per hour. Don't talk to my bird! Carry the two. Yes! Danger, danger! Wayne, old buddy, old pal. You're not landing on me! Fine! Question, though. Do you want to be the guy that cut the wrong wire or the guy that saved the day? Fine! Climb aboard. - Grab on, Eli! - Ready as always, my lady! What are you doing? Shut that door! - One, two, three! - No, wait! Oof! All: Oh! - Whoa! - Whoa! All: Whoa! - Is the snow plow... - Sinking? Yes! Sinkhole! Ow! Are you all right? Do I look all right? I don't appreciate that tone. I'm sorry, Trudy. I forgive you. It's been quite a day. - You okay? - I'm fine. Oh, man, Lane. I just pushed Chuck into a whale, and then I stole his snowmobile... Stop talking, okay? You secretly pined after someone for a long time. And today, instead of keeping it in, you went after it with a grand gesture. You were bold because it's a snow day. There. There's my grand gesture. Wait, wait, you... Look, look, look, look. I'm going ice skating. If I see you there before the rink closes, great. And if I don't, then I promise that tomorrow is a new, normal day. Everything resets, right? And you'll just be my... My pal, Hal, whose shoes I tie and who I kissed once on a snow day. - Hey. - Oh. You surprised me. Well, that's a first. Do you want to sit? Sure. Hey, uh, want some? You eat candy corn when you're nervous, too? No, but I know you do, so I always kept a pack on me in case I ever got the chance to offer you some. Wow. Yeah, challenging to find year-round, but I figured out a system and... Oh. Man. Wow, if I thought I was going to get kissed by two beautiful women today, I would have worn a better shirt. Two beautiful women? Oh, why did I say that out loud? I have this friend... - Lane? - How did you know? Because I'm a girl. Right, man, girls are so much smarter than guys. Yes. Anyways, uh... she kissed me. And even though I never thought about her in that way before, now I kind of can't stop thinking about her in that way. And Lane knows me, like, regular, old me, and somehow, she still likes me. Is it because she has a longer neck than me? Oh, Claire, no, your neck isn't short, okay? And even if it was, no guy in the history of the planet has ever rejected a girl because of her neck length. Thank you. Oh, man, what time does the skating rink close? - 5:00. - Oh, I got to run. Oh, your shoe's untied. Yep, definitely untied. Oh, sorry, sorry. Lane, she ties my shoes for me. Why? She's my hero. Yes, sir! Folks, this is the last song before the rink goes night-night. And you know what that means? That's right, it's the couples-only skate. So you got to grab that special someone or get off the ice. [u Hey, lady with the ugly sweaters. If you ain't got a special someone, get off...
