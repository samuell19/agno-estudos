Long ago there was peace between grassland and ice land, that was preserved by mighty dragons. But when the dark Arctic seized power in Ice Land , all dragons but two disappeared, mysteriously. Since that time both peoples lived separately from each other, Despite everything, there was a wonderful harmony among the grasslands. Good Morning! Good Morning. One morning the wise raven Kolk went to gather herbs. Good morning, Kolk. Good Morning. In the glorious sunshine he had no idea what was going on in the dark cloud, which separated ice land from grassland. (Release) Mythia, the egg! Fly I protect you! - But ... - Come on! Leave my wife alone! (Amazement) (Scream) Mythia! (hoarse breathing) (laugh) (Scream) (hums) (scratching sound) Hm? (keeps humming) (Startling sound) (scratching noises) (Startling sound) Ouch! Mythia what happened? Where's tyrion He is... No! Kolk, you have to take care of our son . He is the last of his kind. What? No! I can not do that! Only he can protect grassland from the Arctic. His name is ... Tabaluga. Mythia. Please, please don't die! Tabaluga! (auspicious use of music) (strained) (moans) Hm? Ah! (Smile) (Snoring) Ah... Oh... Ah... Oh... Oh... Oh... (laugh) (Scream) (Release) Wait! Wait! Oh ... (laughter) (Babylaute) Hello, Tabaluga. (Babylaute) I am Kolk.

Bääh ... Did you see anything I've seen a lot, but it wasn't a flame. I'm sorry. Hm. Yes. (Scream) I can't fly right, I can't spit fire. I will never be a real dragon. Your fire will come one day. Be patient. I don't feel like being patient. Why doesn't it work now? You cannot push nature, Tabaluga. So! I'm going to the menhir to collect new herbs, come on. Well ... If Kolk knows so much about herbs, why doesn't he have one against firelessness? Still no fire, huh? I happen to know a remedy that helps. That makes you a real dragon. Guaranteed! Tabaluga is a real dragon! If he can't spit fire, he isn't! There is only one remedy for firelessness. Nettles! So that's probably the biggest nonsense I've ever ... But hey, I fully understand if you don't want to. In the end, it's really only for real dragons. Do not listen to him! Let's go. (laugh) (laugh) Wait, wait, wait! You're not really thinking about it, are you? What? No of course not! Well, that would be the stupidest and most crazy thing ... A loud scream is coming soon. On three ... one! (Scream) Well, on one.

Pscht! (laugh) Hm? Ah, Tabaluga! There you are! What the fuck is wrong with you? And where have my herbs gone? There were a few ... complications. What kind of complications? Um, well, Emra made him eat nettles. He said that dragons do that to find their fire. And did he believe him? No! Naja ... Yes. (Laughter) Oh ... Cheer up Tabaluga, you will find your fire. Certainly. When your mother entrusted you to me back then ... At the menhir. I know, I know... Yes, then she told me that you are special. Anyway, I'm very good at making a fool of myself. Someday... One day ... you've been saying that for years. Someday... I ca n't hear that "one day" anymore. Where are you going? To the menhir to get your stupid herbs. Emra is right: I will never be a real dragon. Emra is a fool. I don't care what the others say. For me you are a real dragon. With or without fire. Thank you bully.

I always knew I was a lucky bug. This is where my mother died. Here she gave me to Kolk. That must be a message from her. Wait a minute, you don't think that ... That's exactly what I believe! Oh come on, it's not like that where you put your fire ... Somehow. But I would say it's a matter of interpretation. Come on, you ca n't really want to go to Eisland! The Icelanders are a common people, even worse than common. And Arktos is the worst of them all! Says Kolk. This is the chance to find my fire! But but... Don't you understand that bully? A dragon without fire is like ... ... like a lucky bug without luck! Ok, that's an argument. But I still don't like it! I have to do this! I feel it deep inside me. Are you there or not? Uh ... Oh... Of course I'm in! Oh and what is it? Hi there!? It's called Eisland! Emphasis on ice! Now let's go before I change my mind. But I'll say Kolk it was your idea! He will understand! Wow... So this is ice land? Doesn't look very inviting, does it? I think we should rather ... ... fly into the dark cloud without thinking too much! Your fire won't be of much use to you when you're dead! Wow, this is ice land. We really did it! Oh, is that snow? Wow, that's crazy! Hahaha, look at that! That's crunchy and soft at the same time! (laugh) Show-off! (heavy steps) Icelanders! (Sneeze) Ups... They look even worse than I thought! Are you finally getting cold feet? It is about time! Let's get out of here! I, uh ... (distant singing) What are you waiting for? Hey! Do you hear the? That sounds beautiful! Hey Hi there! Wrong direction! (distant singing) Hey what are you doing there Isn't she the most beautiful creature you've ever seen? Uh, no, she's an Icelander. She's probably spraying poison out of her eyes! But listen to what's coming out of her mouth. Oh well, this won't end well. I feel it in my antennae! They are never wrong! Especially when they agree. (Screams) Hey, watch out! (atmospheric music) (Clearing his throat) Sorry, the ice is slippery and ... You sing so ... Oh. Dance like that ... ... and are so ... ...so beautiful. Oh! Worth! At! You are a ... dragon! Yes ... Yes, I think so. I've been waiting for you all my life . On me? And! (Use of music) What's this? That's magic. Dragon magic! Just like Arktos always said. I have to get you to him right now! Arctos? But he's a monster! What? No! He is our protector. For real? Did you hear that, bully? That doesn't sound like what Kolk always told us! A grasslander! Leave him alone, Icelander, or else ... Wow! Bully is my friend! Friend? This is a grassland! He'll tear off your head with his claws and play football with it. That's the right one! You're the one with the fangs and claws! I think we all have some misconceptions about each other. But what about the polar bears we saw earlier? You mean limbo? Nonsense! He'll love this! Limbo! You have to see that! A real dragon! (removed steps) (Screams) A dragon? For real? I have to see that with my own ears! Wow, Lilli. Hm? Lilli, this is the moment you've always been waiting for! So you can breathe fire out of your mouth Sometimes weird stuff comes out of my bottom, but no fire. Can you breathe fire once, please? Oh please ... please! Ok the guy's not dangerous! A grasslander! Don't tear my head off! He won't hurt you! Grasslands are not as bad as you think! Really now? What are kites and grasslanders doing here in Eisland? Uh ... well ... I can ... uh, I mean ... He is looking for his fire! One more reason to take you to Arktos . He can surely help you! Do you think? Well, I do not know... It smells like a trap to me. But look at her: would she lie to us? Trust me this way. I come with. I can't leave you alone with the Grünlander! Who knows what's going on in this beetle head ... Whoa! Look at my antennas that say something is wrong here! Oh, don't be so suspicious. Wow! These are the crystal forests. Aren’t they beautiful? You definitely are, uh ... I mean the forests! I ... I mean, you are beautiful too, so are your forests ... I don't even know your name! Neither do I. So, um ... Tabaluga. Nice to meet you, Tabaluga. I am Lilli. That's the nicest name I've ever heard. Hm ... Oh! Ah... Oh, oh! Oh limbo, not again. You know I can't cross this bridge! Follow me! You can do it, trust me! Trust a grasslander? I'm done... You can't look down. Look at me! I prefer to look down ... Ah! I prefer to look up! You can do it, come on! And one ... and two ... and three ... I knew this beetle had an evil plan. And four ... and five ... Goodbye, Lilli. Open your eyes, scaredy. I am not a rabbit, I am a polar bear. Bad plan huh? Oh... 'Sorry... I mean ... uh ... thanks! Bully! I am limbo. I know. Come on let's go It'll take hours to get down there. No it won't! Where's Bully? Bully? Bully! Where are you? Are you looking for anything (laugh) Wow! Wow! This is Polaris, the palace of Arktos. So, this is definitely a nasty villain's home. Kind of cool, don't you think? Yeah let's go Wait, is there any way you can make yourself invisible? You know, the Icelanders don't know any grasslanders. How am I supposed to do that? I'm small, but red. That stands out. What? What are you looking at me? Are we already there? Wow, a real dragon! (amazed murmur) Bully, look: it's like we're expected! How should i see this I only see nose hairs and a booger. A real dragon! Arktos is coming! (threatening music) Long live Arktos! What kind of commotion is this here? Oh, oh, the guy doesn't look friendly . Let's go home! No, this is my only chance! Arctos! I found one, imagine! What have you found? I brought him to you as you told me to! Tabaluga, please come here! A dragon? I knew it. A dragon, what a joy! Do not be afraid, Tabaluga. Hi there! He is looking for his fire. The dragon has no fire? Really none? No. Oh, that's extremely sad. You know, my little ice crystal, you made me very happy. My dear friend, you are trembling as if you were standing in front of a monster. Well, that's what everyone in grassland calls you. Oh, these terrible prejudices. Allow me to show you my friendship. I give you your fire. (laughs) So are you really the one who can help me? Anyway, I'm the one to whom the dragons entrusted the secret of their fire before they vanished. Under my palace lies one of the most secret places: the source of the eternal dragon fire. Huh? Eisländer, today is the day I ... uh, we've been waiting for so long. The last dragon has finally found its way back to us! And now I'll give him his fire! (Cheers and applause) Follow me my friend Wow. I have a very stupid feeling about this. Welcome to my humble home. Penguin architects are a nightmare. But it turned out nice anyway , don't you think? Yes, it's kind of really cozy. (Clearing throat) This way my friends. I'm afraid only dragons are allowed from here. But why? Because, well ... the eternal dragon fire is very sensitive. If anyone other than a dragon enters the grotto, it is extinguished forever. (Pinguinlaute) For dragons only. (Pinguinlaute) I'll be back as soon as I can! I promise it! So, Tabaluga, the very last dragon. You're the very last, aren't you? Yes I am! Only dragons are allowed in the cave, right? Correct! Because otherwise the eternal dragon fire will go out forever, right? Correct! Isn't it then a little strange that Arktos is allowed in there? Right, uh ... Does he look like a dragon to you? Well, um ... All right, I'll follow you! Wait bully, you can't ... Um ... We're almost there, just a little way! What are you waiting for dear For an invitation? Oh, the eternal dragon fire! That's right, Tabaluga. Look into the flames! Why is it blue Because, uh ... it's a magical fire, of course. Tabaluga! Magical fire. Hold on, I'm coming! Well finally. Worth. Was? Dragons! All dead! Ah! Well, not quite all of them as it looks! - Taba ...! - Wait, be careful. I can't tell you at all, Tabaluga, how happy I am to have you in my power! You! You killed my parents! Yes, clever little dragon! Was? I knew you existed! That's why I created an irresistible dragon trap to attract you. A kite trap? Yes, you may know her by the name Lilli. Was? - no! - What did he say? That can not be! I am a kite trap I have trusted Arktos all my life. Oh no. What have I done? Lilli would never do that! But she did. Distract Arktos, I'm going in! Ok! Oh... Was? Think of something! (Rock music use) Now I will finally finish what I started!

Are you all well? Mhm. It depends, am I holding up two fingers or three? It's a branch, bully. Ah, I ... I don't understand why my mother sent me to ice land when Arktos is so dangerous. Well, does she really have that? Maybe we got the message wrong? So this is grassland? And Arktos certainly can't follow us this far? Huh? (Sigh) What? Huh? Maybe I can't enter grassland now , but just wait and see ! You will curse the day you messed with me. (laugh) Yes! Better get out of here! Come on guys, let's fly home. Grassland isn't that bad, is it? (laugh) (snoring) Isn't that ...? Tabaluga where have you been I've been looking for you everywhere and ... An icelander! (excited mess) Have you been to ice land? Hi, my name is Lilli, don't be afraid! You see, no fangs or claws. (amazed sounds) I know we shouldn't go to ice land but much of what we have been told is wrong. You are just like us! Yes, they're actually pretty nice. Except for this type of Arktos ... What a brake on fun! Arktos has my parents on the conscience and all other dragons! My people had no idea. We love kites! We trusted Arktos, but he lied to us. He lied to me. He didn't follow you, did he? Only to the limit. Arktos has no way to cross it. So grassland has nothing to fear. Until now. Lilli was the perfect kite trap. Elegant ... cold ... What did I miss? I couldn't make her immune to love. And now she's up and away with that darn little kite. This creature must be destroyed. But how? I can't just go back to this disgusting grassland. (Pinguinlaute) Are we supposed to tell the Ice Landers that the dragon kidnapped Lilli? (Pinguinlaute) So that the Ice Landers start a war against the Grasslanders ? (affirmative penguin sounds) Nonsense! Got it: I'm telling the Ice Landers that the dragon kidnapped Lilli. So that the ice lands start a war against the grass lands! Why do you never have such ideas? Mirmel, call the Icelanders together tomorrow ! I have important news for you! Do you think of home (affirmative) Mmm. Do you think Limbo is fine? Oh, I'm quite sure of that! He made it out of Polaris, I'm sure he's fine. Mhm. Isn't that weird? An icelander and a grasslander go for a walk? People would go nuts. Yes they would. I'm freaking out too, well , I mean in a good way. I'm going to Eisland to find my fire and what can I find there?

What are we supposed to do? (applied whispers) Should we fight against it? And! Attack grassland? And! Fight? (Cheers) And kill the last dragon? Yes ... (Silent) (Pinguinlaute) To bring our Lilli back home? And! What did I tell you about the whisper ? Now the ear stinks of fish. Open the gate! (scared) Ha ha ha! (Marching lute) Another Icelander? Are you sure? He was all white and tall, a beast with claws and fangs! (astonish) (excited sounds) Limbo! Lilli! Don't worry, he won't harm you. He is as friendly as he is tall. (laugh) I am so glad that you are safe. Lilli, I have news! But the very worst kind! What happened? Arktos told everyone you stole Lilli. You would have kidnapped her! Now he's sent his army to attack grassland and ... ... to kill you. (Murmuring) Isn't that great? Now we're all in danger just because of you! I have to go back to Ice Land and tell everyone the truth. Arktos can't get away with it! Then I'll go too! No, you can't go there again. Arktos will kill you! I don't care! If you go I go too! Nothing will happen to me , maybe I can't trust the army. But the Icelanders are a good people. If I tell them the truth, they will rebel against Arktos! I go with you! But how are we supposed to stop Arktos? He's just way too powerful. There is a chance! You have to go to Nessaja. (questioning murmur) Nessaja? Yes, she lives in the swamps. She knows things that no one else knows. To Nessaja? How so? Tabaluga, only your fire can stop Arktos! Was? Oh! We're done. Only Nessaja can help you find your fire. You have no time to lose! Why are you telling me this now? Because you can only go to her once in your life! And you had to be ready to learn who you are. I, uh. All right then. Let's go Lilli. Good luck, Tabaluga. What? Won't you come with me Nice hero! He's afraid of going into the swamps alone! I am not afraid to go alone. It's just, I thought ... Lilli ... Why are you looking at me Do you want me to hold your hand Oh... It really looks like you are scared! I know fireflies who have more courage than you! (laugh) (Laughs) I'm coming with you! I will go to the swamps. And alone! Oh ... ok ... if you think so. That was so mean! (scornful laughter) Limbo, listen to me. That was the hardest thing I ever did. But I only did it to protect Tabaluga. I had to let him go. Because he would never have let me go to Eisland alone. Oh? Ah!

Wow! Ah! You must be the young dragon Tabaluga? Yes, uh, well ... Yes! Please sit down. So you are looking for your fire. What have you tried so far? I practiced every day, I even went to Ice Land to find it. When you are thirsty, do you go to the desert? What? No! If you want fresh daisies, do you look for them in a lake? Um, why should I want daisies? So, listen, well: I need my fire, it's very important! My friends can die. I've looked everywhere! Did you look over there too? I live here and have never seen you look over there. Hehehe, all right, all right! I tell you where your fire is. You were right: your fire was in Eisland. It was at your home too , it's here in the swamps. It's wherever you go in your life because your fire is here. In me? Not exactly! That's why I'm here! Hi there? Now are you just disappearing in there again? Thanks for the advice! It was pretty general and unhelpful, not to say useless. So, see you. Or maybe not. Bye! (Laughs) (approaching steps) (incomprehensible commands) Oh no, they're stretching ice land into grassland! Arktos will soon be able to cross the border. Oh what are we supposed to do? The army is loyal to Arktos. We have to go to the real ice lands! (Swallows) (Pinguinlaute) (Grunt) Um ... (Scream) Oh, you hideous beast! Just grab me like that! You can't arrest me, I'm an icelander. I didn't do anything! Huh? Oh, uh ... yes! Right, she's right. I have arrested you, the dangerous Lilli. (commanding penguin sounds) (dramatic music) Tabaluga! What did Nessaja say? Do you see fire anywhere? Who cares what she said? The Iceland Army is coming and I can't stop them. But well? What did she say? Some nonsense about daisies and that my fire is everywhere where i go and blah blah blah. Lilli! Who? You know who Lilly! She is back to Eisland! What? But she wanted ... that can't be ... Oh no. I'm such an idiot! She only did the whole thing to protect me and save grassland! This is my fault just because I had to find my stupid fire. - Listen to me! - You are all in danger now. Lilli is gone! All for my sake! Hi there! Glückskäfer to wretches! You arrested her. They bring Lilli to Arktos. Was? Worth! You can't stop me, I'll save Lilli. I have to do it with or without my fire. I'm so proud of you! Listen, nessaja may be a little strange sometimes but she is never wrong! Let's go! Go save your girlfriend. (Use of music) Thanks.

Tabaluga, we have to get out of here. Fast! Oh not good. Not good! Welcome back, little dragon. (Pinguinlaute) I am happy to have you as a guest again.

Place there! (Pinguinlaute) You want to leave me already? No! Stay a little longer, for an iced tea! Or just a little ice cream? (Lute) Tabaluga? Wake up! - Wake up! - (Laugh) Don't move, you fat ice cream loaf! You're annoying, grasslanders! Bully! Au, au, au. Have no fear. I'll get you out of there! And now to you! No, not Arktos! Lilli! Do what you want with me Destroy me, but let Lilli live! Young love how cute! It'll be even sweeter when one of them watches the other freeze! (laugh) Who's first Ene-Mene-Moo! Say goodbye to Lilli! No! Yes, hahaha! Yes! Show him! Oh? Hm... Wow! (Sigh) Whoa! I taught him everything! - Wait, was I under your armpit? - Mmm. So you've found your fire. But it's too late, little dragon! Limbo! Bully! Go save Lilli! Ok, Boss! Hm? Wah! Lilli! Watch out! (excited mess) Lilli? Lilli! Lilli, where are you? Oh no... Please no! (Laughter) No dragon has ever defeated me! And you won't be an exception! What did you do to Lilli, Arktos? Lilli is where she belongs. Once you're destroyed, nothing stands in my way Then I will rule the earth! No! Come on, get up! Get yourself to safety, quickly! No, don't give up, you can do it! (laugh) - Oh no! - (Laugh) Lilli is gone, your fire is gone. Just like your father when he lost your mother. It's interesting that a kite's greatest weakness is its heart. But, it's also its greatest strength! Lilli! - Attention! - My eyes! Was? Arktos, give up! No way! What? What happened? Shrink it to beetle size, Tabaluga! My beautiful hat! Here's your hat, little man! Help me, my loyal people! Destroy the dragon! We won't do that! What? Didn't you see that? This dragon attacked me. He kidnapped Lilli ... he ... You think you can tell us anything? I am your leader! I command you ... Oh forget it. I will freeze you all! Look at me, I'll bring the storm! (Laughter) You didn't want it any other way, I ... So I... I will turn back! (Pinguinlaute) Icelanders! Ingrateful gang! This is all your fault! One has of working with penguins.
