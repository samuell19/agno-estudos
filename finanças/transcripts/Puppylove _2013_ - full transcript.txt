We don't have to do it straight away. Don't you want to? Sure, but... The sheet's pinning me down. Oh, sorry. You know, Diane... I think you're beautiful. Is everything okay? Yeah, but I don't want to talk. Okay, sorry. Can you put on some music? Sorry, my player's bust. Stop saying sorry. Oh, sorry. I don't think I want to do it anymore. You could knock. What are you up to? Watching TV. I came to say goodnight. Turn that off. Good night. ...to express a negative similarity. I did it this weekend. Yeah, right. - Don't you believe me? I swear... What's it like when it goes in? - It's really scary because... If I said, for example: "I don't like pupils drawing during my lesson," What would you reply? It's too bad. In the context of this lesson? Good. Copy what's on the board, then I'll give you other examples. And his mother? She's a painter, she's cool. But it was during the day. I closed my eyes. We couldn't close the shutters, or she'd have guessed what we were doing. I was really embarrassed. Did it hurt? Yeah, a bit, if you think about it. He told me that you don't feel any pleasure the first time. No pleasure the first time... Mind your own business. What are you talking about? Say it out loud. Frank, do you want to give the lesson instead of me? Can I? No! Right, get out. Go on, Gilles! That's it. Go on, quick. There was nobody up front. Nice try. Not bad. Okay, guys, move over for the girls. C'mon, Frank! Enough! Are you a girl? No, you're not. Casper and Gilles, stay in the goals. You'll be keepers for the girls, okay? No! Oh, yes! You wanted to play more, you've got it. Ready, girls? Off we go! Not bad at all. Go for it! It doesn't matter, play on! It wasn't done on purpose. Play on. Diane! What're you doing? Everything okay, girls? Strange smell... Always the same ones. - It smells of sweat... The door was open! Want to touch? Diane. Coming. Oops, he's gonna wait outside for her! Hurry up, Diane. - He's waiting for you! How sweet! Have you watched films? Porn? Uh...no. Why'd you ask? No reason. I've gotta go. No, stay. We haven't even eaten. I'm not hungry. Please stay. Eat that half. - Don't want to. I'm not hungry. Not for that, anyway. Antoine rang. Who's Antoine? The little guy from hockey, with a scooter? You think he's small? I didn't mean anything. What did he want? It was for a party. I don't know where. Sounds good, huh? There's a party at Marie's on Saturday. Are you going? Yes. If I could, I'd go out every evening. Oh yeah? Silly boy. Where would you go, clever clogs? - To party? I'll go. There's a girl outside. Hello. - Hello. Sorry to disturb you. It's okay, we've finished eating. My mother was wondering if you know a piano teacher. We live round here, we've just moved in. We can ask around. We live next door. My name's Julia. Cool... I'm Christian... my daughter, Diane, and Marc. Hi. I think I've already seen you. Wasn't that you in the window? No. No? Something to drink? No, thanks. A dessert? No, I have to be going. - No? Sure? Okay, then. We'll ask around, see what we find. See you soon. - Bye. Here. We have a new neighbour. Seems nice, doesn't she? Finish your pasta. - I'm not hungry. It disgusts me. Hi. - Hi. I've got the number of a piano teacher. I don't give a shit about the piano. I just wanted a closer look at the girl spying on me. I'm not spying. Yeah, right. Come here. - Let go. Come here, you'll get run over. Stop it. Julia? - Yes? There's a party Saturday. Want to come? With you? Yeah. Come and get me. Bye. - Bye. "There's a party Saturday. Want to come?" Stop it. - "Stop it." Be quiet. - "Be quiet." You're a pain. - "You're a pain." Dad? Dad? - What're you doing? Yes? Is this sweater okay? Nice. Very nice. Forget it. - What did I say? Bye. See you tomorrow. - Bye. Have fun. Hi. - Hi. D'you like this group? I saw them in concert. They're wild. I told my parents I'd be sleeping in your place. Okay. They'll be less of a pain. Nice sweater. Thanks. Going to get made-up? - No. I'd wear it all the time, if I could. Sure you don't want to? - No, I'd rather stay like this. My hands are slippy. Could you open this? Thanks. Julia, you ready? Hello. Diane, right? Hurry up. We must go now. Take this. 14 ends with 4. - Seen any clean glasses? You say 'apple' for 4 and 'strawberry' for 7. Okay. Right, then. 1. 2. 3... ...4! - No! How hard can it be? Any white wine? When I say 1, you say 2, you say 3, I say 'apple'. Then at 7... Antoine! Hi, how are you? Coming. I'll just finish this. Okay? Wanna smoke? No. Come on! - No! Come on. Please. - I don't want to. I want to smoke with you. - I don't want to. Sorry. Have you seen a girl with brown hair, down to here? No. Seen the brunette I came with? Who? The brunette I came with. No, sorry. I looked all over for you. I'm here. Coming home? - No, we're going out. Enjoying yourself? Lousy party. - Yeah. Shall I come with you? Sure, you're my alibi. Hurry! You can come, but you do as I say. Don't stop me from doing what I want. Come on. We're going for a drive. Get in. Does your friend speak English too? It's Diane, she's shy. C'mon, get in. Don't worry, we'll soon loosen up your friend. Go for it! Hey, man, drop it. You're not alone. Drop it! That's enough. Go somewhere else to do that. If you're not happy, get out. Fuck this! Carry on. Don't stop. Relax. Stop, please! You shittin' me! You speak French! C'mon, kiss me! - Let go of me! It's okay. Let go of her! Let go of her! Let her go! Stupid pricks! What did you do? Jerks! Motherfuckers! Bastards! It's okay, they didn't see us. We still had a good time, huh? Even if it wasn't great at first, it got better after. Then it got bad 'cos they were jerks, but... Your face okay? Let me see. You're white as a sheet. I hate this place. I bet we can't find a taxi. Move! Shall I sleep with you? - Yeah, you can sleep with me. You know it'll happen one day? You can't avoid it. Everything else, but not that. 'Night. Marc, stop playing. Marc, you hear me? What? - Stop playing. No! Stop playing, please. - No! Stop! Thank you. Julia! Julia! What're you doing? - Looking after my brother. You? I'm stuck here. Turn it up! Louder, I can't hear. - What? Louder! I'll play something for you. I can't hear! Julia! That's quite enough! Off the pitch quick, guys! Don't forget the cones. Keepers, put your stuff in the goals. I'll get my stuff. You go. You're sure? - Yes. See you in a bit. Are you in love? Don't be silly. Gonna try get her into bed? Drop it. She's just a friend. I don't give a damn. We're not going out. Do as you please. Why? Does it piss you off? Guys, she's naked! Come! Come! Diane, what the hell are you doing? Who cares? She wants to be naked. Beat it, beat it! So, Diane... Want a kiss, right? What's going on here? Come on, back to your pals. Leave her alone, Frank. Take it easy, Coach. Get out! What's gotten into you, Diane? Are you mad? Come, cover yourself up. Come on. Do you think I'm pretty? What? Do you think I'm pretty? Of course. Today, do you think I'm pretty? What d'you mean? Why do you think I'm pretty, now? Not just now...I've always thought you pretty. You're my daughter. - What more can I say? - Stop. Would you... Do you... D'you think I'm sexy? What? Would you like to sleep with me? Diane, that's crazy. I'm your father! Diane... I'm your father... It doesn't matter. Drop me here. - What? - Stop! - I'd rather walk. Stop! - Wait. You must understand... It's a difficult question to answer. Don't get cross. Come back, Diane! My father's a jerk and I hate my mother! You're lucky, your Dad's adorable. - It's not the same. I can tell he loves you. He lets you do what you want. I think... D'you think he finds me beautiful? Dunno. Have you seen how he looks at me? I'm sure he likes youngsters. Have you packed your case? Yep. I'll only be gone two days, Dad. You'll get by. What'll I do without my girl? Poor Dad. Right. Good night. Good night. He walks in the fields back and forth, it's his work of art, ephemeral art. It's fascinating. Sometimes he walks in a circle. He walks in a circle... one way, then the other... It's his... Are you okay? Are you sure? Must be the nuts. Some water? No, that's fizzy. Got any...? - It's kind of you, thanks. Sorry. Shall I come with you? You've got the keys. Yes, I'm coming. Don't stay up too late. Good night, Julia. I'm counting on you. Take care of her. Good night, girls. See you tomorrow. Drink? We're not allowed. 'Course we can. We deserve it. Hello. - Hello. Two shots of vodka, please. Do you have your parents' permission? Very funny. Cheers. Bottoms up. It's too strong! Another? Right. Coming? - Yes. It wasn't like he'd said. Then when we got there, we needed a credit card. We were with this guy and he continued ranting on... Hey! - Everything okay? I'll take over now. - Okay. Great. Well...my shift is over, girls. So, have a good evening. 427. Pardon? 427. What...? See you later. I don't think it's a good idea. Sure it is. C'mon. You're over 18? Okay, I'll get changed and be right back. Why'd you do that? I don't want to. I don't fancy him. You're just scared. I want to have fun. I don't want to. Do as you please. Come on. I'll wait for you here. Yeah, wait for me... Sit down. Come over here. Come close. Kiss me. You alright? Yes. Get undressed, don't stay like that. Do you like to watch? Yes, it's beauiful. I think you're both beautiful. I have to pee. Do you want to kiss me? Yes. It's late. What? I think you should go. My parents are next door. Sorry? It'd be a pity if they heard us. Your parents are just there? Yes, so just go. Handsome, eh? "So the young girl will dance and the young men and the old men together will change..." Would change. "Would change their pain..." - What? Would change... "I would make joy follow their pain." What're you doing? Nothing. Why are you looking at me like that? What are you up to? What's this nonsense? See that guy over there? With the bonnet. Next to the blonde? - Yes. Go over and get him. Do him. Sweetheart, will you get me a drink? What? - Get me a drink, please? Right now? - Yes. Alright. Do you want to kiss me? - What? Do you want to kiss me? Kiss you? No, I'm with my girlfriend. Who cares? She can't see us. You're unbelievable. I want you to suck me. Go on, suck me. Diane! Diane! What happened? Leave me alone. Did he give you the brush-off? I don't want to talk to you. You fuck like a whore. It doesn't bother you. I can't do it. Oh la la. It's not like that. A one-night stand with a guy means nothing. Nothing. You know what? We'll find you a guy. He'll be yours. It'll be great. I promise, it'll be great. Want to go home? I'm tired. - You're tired. It's freezing. Really cold. What about your guy? - Shit! Who gives a fuck! Let's go. Want to go? Yes, it looks interesting. The exhibitions look good. As it's sunny, I'd like to take the cable car. Julia, are you okay? Yes, fine. Why? I don't know. You look strange. I didn't sleep well. - Pardon? I didn't sleep well. - You look like death warmed up. It's true. You could say thank you. We invite your friend for the weekend and you look glum all the time. Thanks a lot. It's my fault. I talked to her all night and kept her awake. I had lots of things to tell her. Did it go well? - Yes. Hello, Marc. - Hi. 'Scuse me. What's for dinner? We're going to eat healthily. Vegetables! What you like best. Plates! Out of the way, you! This is Annick. - Ah, Diane! Hello. Watch out! It's burning. We work together. Have you got any lemons? Have we got any lemons? I don't think so... No. Salt and pepper? Salt and pepper, seasonings and spice are there. Don't hold back with that! Is she also in charge when you fuck? What's gotten into you, Diane? What's with you? Be quiet, you! How're things? - Fine. Make any coffee? No. Why not? You okay? Yes. Where's Marc? Asleep. You didn't wake him? - No. Why not? Didn't feel like it. I'm not his father. See you this evening. I saw her there. Julia! How're you? Where's your father? - Over there. I see him. - I'll carry your case. I must thank him. If not for him I'd be at home, bored to death! Want to go in front? Dunno. - Go in front. Okay, thanks. Whatever suits you. I'm here with the kids... My parents might come at the end of the week, for a couple of days. You want to meet them? You must be joking. No, listen... I'll see if you can come down for a day or two. Lots of kisses. Ciao. D'you think Julia's awake? Dunno. You look peaky. Why do you say that? Are you in love? Nonsense. You can tell me everything, you know. I can see you and Julia are close... What did she say? She said nothing. It's just me who... Dad, you see nothing. You don't know what's happening. You always talk such rubbish. You have a problem with me. - I don't have a problem... Look after your slut, leave me alone. Don't get all pissed off. Wait... Diane! Carry the shopping. - There's glass in there! Diane! I just wanted us... to have a little chat! How's it going? What're you doing? I went for a run. It's hot, eh? Yeah. Yeah. What're you doing? Hurry up. Cool it, we're on holiday. There's nothing here. So fucking boring! Let's go over there. There might be more going on. We'll get a drink, meet some guys. - Don't feel like it. Maybe you're just scared. - No. You could make an effort. What? Take off your cardigan. No, it's a great cardigan. No, it's dull. - It's great. It's ugly. Hello, I'm Julia, this is my friend, Diane. Can we come for a ride on the boat? He doesn't speak French. It's her first time. She's never been on a boat. You okay? - I'm fine. Looks like he's panicking. A little boat ride... Cute, isn't he? - Yeah. Yeah? - I dunno. Come on, he's really cute! Admit it. Move closer to him. Sing a little song. Your turn. Stop it, Dad. Snap your fingers. Can you do it? Be gentle, she's a virgin. Well, yeah! Come here. What? Show me your face. What about it? I don't feel different. It's you who's happy. It's thanks to me. Come. I didn't feel anything. Is that normal? I dunno. Who cares? The important thing is you did it. Yeah. Let's get out of here. - Yes. I've got the ball! It's freezing! Dad? Dad, can I come in? - What? Can I take a pee? Okay. Sit down. No, I don't want to sit down. Hey, what are you doing here? You're so stupid. That's enough, girls. I don't believe it! Really! You can't do this. I'll do the same to you. Here. Goddammit, Marc. It's so hot. - I'll do that. Thanks. Fancy watching a film? - Yeah. What've we got here? Karaoke. We have to do it! What're you doing? I can't sleep. What're you looking for? The cigarettes. I want to smoke a cigarette. You do? - Yeah. They're in my bag, on the cupboard. What are you doing? Nothing. Go back to sleep. Sweet dreams. Give, I'll light it. Here. We're good together, huh? All together. I know. You should move around a bit, girls. No. Come on! Wake up! I'm out of water. Wait! No! There! That got you moving. Wow! Is this my daughter? Julia lent it to me. It suits you. And this? Aren't you going to put it on? Show me. It suits you. You're wearing make-up, too! - Stop! We'll have a drink together! - Think that's a good idea? Yes! - Okay, then. One little glass. - That's little... Thanks. Cheers! I'll open this for you. There. Already? What did you expect? You're so stingy. Go and dance! Coming? Shall we go? What? - Shall we go? Already? - Where's Marc? I saw Marc sleeping over there. What're you doing here? Nothing. Are you going out again? - No, I'm staying here. Aren't you going to bed? - No, not going to bed. No, no...wait. Wait... Everybody's sleeping. This isn't a good idea. No. No, no no... You musn't. No. Okay? Better not. No. Stop. Stop. Stop. What're you doing here? Wait... Jeez... Wait, Diane! Shit! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Let go of me! - Where are you going? Let her go, for God's sake! Diane! Bastard! Bastard! Fuck! Bastard! I'm cold. Let's go back. Okay. Are you sulking? No. I'd have left, too. But I wouldn't have come back. I didn't come back. My father came to get me. Same difference. You're here, aren't you? Shut up, please. Come here. Come on. I don't give a shit about your father. Or the others. It's just for fun. Would you do something for me? Dunno. If I asked you? What? Do what? To split... right now, on foot. Leave everyone behind. Just drop everyone. What for? For fun! 'Cos we don't give a shit. That's what counts, huh? I don't think so. I don't feel like it. Where would we go? What're you doing? Diane! Stop, Diane, stop! Diane! What're you doing? Come here. --subtitles by c53--
