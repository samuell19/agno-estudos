You seem so sad. This is supposed to be a happy time. Why are you so glum? - Oh, no, I'm fine. Just got a few things weighing on me I guess. Just been thinking about Mom and Dad a lot lately. I miss 'em so much. And now Christmas, it's just not gonna be the same without 'em. - I miss 'em too. - Oh, I know you do. - You said a couple things. What else? - You know, I'm worried about Don Ford. - Don Ford? - Mm-hmm. - What's wrong with Don? - I don't know, but missed our men's group two weeks in a row, and he wasn't at church. It's just, it's not like Don. I called over there earlier and he won't answer the phone. I don't know what's going on. - Is he sick? - I don't know. Could be heartsick's more like it. This is his first Christmas without Mary Anne. - Oh, without Mary Anne. - Poor man. I can't imagine what he's going through right now. And his daughter Celia, she's out in Los Angeles. He's gotta be worried about her. They have a lot going on. - So all of this mood has nothing to do with Allen? No, I'm done with that. I'm tired of worrying about him. I'm sure you are too, right? - Yeah, well, I am, but he's your brother. And I know that you worry about him. I mean, it was tough enough getting him out of New York. Now he's all the way stuck in Los Angeles. - Look at you. Stuck. I'm pretty sure Allen don't see it that way. You're funny. - No more glum face. - No more glum face, it's all happy from here on out. - Happy faces. - Allen, that was great, man. One of the best session guitarists in the business. - Thank you. It's been great working with you. - Too bad you won't sing, though. You could lay down some of your songs. - Well, maybe find me a singer. - After Christmas for sure. In the meantime, I got something big coming up. I might need you. - How big? - Well-known band, world tour. Big money. They need a rhythm guitarist. - Sounds great.

We haven't seen you in church for a while. Why don't you come by on Sunday? After the service we can talk about you playing guitar in the Christmas pageant. Not likely. Hey, George. Hey, how's it going out there? - Oh, not too bad. - Not exactly a rousing endorsement for Los Angeles. You know, we miss you out here. - Oh, well, that's good to hear. And I thought you'd be angry with me for not coming back. - Can't say I'm exactly happy about it, but you're a grown man, you make your own decisions. - Yeah, thanks for that. Anyway, I wanted to let you know that I'm considering coming back for Christmas. - Wait, just for Christmas? - Just considering. - Well, we'd all love to have you out here just so you know. - Well, thanks, George. Thanks for everything. - You're welcome. Just let me know what you decide, okay? - I will. I'll talk to you later. What a beautiful night. Yeah, it really is. It's cold though. You warm enough? Oh. Now I am. - That sure was nice of the neighbors to take the kids ice skating. - Do you remember the time Billy Thomas took a snowball and threw it right at my face? And you chased him around the neighborhood. - I never did catch that kid. Last time he ever threw a snowball at you, though. - Yeah. I knew that's when you loved me. - What are you talking about? We were just children. - Yeah. But I knew. - So on that note, why don't we call it a night? Go home early and get warm. - That sounds like a wonderful plan. - Yeah. Gives us some time together. Here you go. Well done tonight. Everybody had a great time. - Thanks. Mm. You know, I think you should go see Don tomorrow after work. I think he'd be really happy to see you. - I highly doubt that. He won't even return my phone calls. - Well then don't do it for him. Do it for you. You're gonna continue to worry about him. - Yeah, you're probably right. I'm gonna go by tomorrow and talk to him. - Good. You remember, Don tomorrow. - Yes, ma'am. - George. What are you doing here? - Don, fact is, I'm a little bit worried about you. And a whole lot of other people at church worried about you, too. - Well, that's nice. You tell 'em I'm fine. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Don! You're gonna need to do better than that. Let me in for a minute, all right? Don, please. - All right. Just sit there until you're convinced I'm doing fine. - All right. Then I will. Come on, Don. What's going on with you? A couple weeks ago in church you seemed to be just fine. - I haven't been too good for a while. I guess I'm good at hiding it. - Sorry to hear that. I didn't know. - It's not your fault. Things have been building up. Mary Anne dying and Celia and I estranged. Then Thanksgiving came along, and I just got down in the dumps I guess. - I had no idea that you and Celia were estranged. - I guess that's what you call it. She hasn't spoken to me in over a year. She won't return any of my phone calls. - Huh. Do you have any idea why? - We had a fight. She said some things. Well. I said some things she didn't appreciate. - Maybe you need to patch things up. - I don't think so. Friend of mine called me from Cincinnati, said he saw her in a horror movie. He's a horror buff. Said he didn't think I'd be too proud. I could never bring myself to watch it. - Yeah, yeah. Can't say as I blame you for that. - So you see, things haven't been too good for a while. - But Don, see, these are the moments when you should be leaning on God. I mean, lean on the church, lean on us. - If it's all the same to you, I'd just as soon set it out for a while. - Well, I can't force you. That's for sure. But I can pray for you. - Put in a good word for Celia, too. - Yeah. I will, Don. I'll pray for both of you. - Hey. - Hi, hi. Hey, hey, hey. - All right, how's Don? - Yeah, that's not good. The man's pretty low. Depressed. - Yeah, when I'm low, I normally go to church. The fellowship lifts my spirit. - Yeah, me too. That's what I was telling him. I think if we could just get him in church for a little while, get him out of his own head, I think we can help him get through this. - Yeah, I mean, with Mary Anne being gone and Celia being so far away. - I can't imagine what the man's going through right now. And I know he misses Mary Anne, but I think it is, I think he's worried about Celia. I think that's what's weighing on him right now. - Okay. - Carly stole my socks. - They're mine! - I got this. - Okay. Hey. - Huh? - I know you're gonna have a plan for Don. - Oh yeah, you know I will.

I got something to tell you. - Well, I got a favor to ask of you. - Okay. Well, you go first. You remember Don Ford? - Yeah, sure. - Well, poor man, his wife passed away last year and he could really use some family support right about now. Celia, his only daughter, well, she's out there in Los Angeles, that's where you come in. - Okay. How? - Well, I mean, you've been considering making that trip back home. I thought maybe you could reach out to Celia and see if she'd come back with you. You can make that cross-country mission you keep talking about, and you'd both be home in time for Christmas. - Okay. Well, I'll do my best. I was gonna tell you that I was gonna plan on coming home anyway for Christmas. I can't make any promises that I can find Celia or even if she'd wanna come back. But either way, I'm coming back. - Good. I am glad to hear that. And you know what? It may all work out just perfectly. - I'll let you know how it goes. Anyway, I got a recording session coming up, so I gotta go. So I'll talk to you soon. - All right. Take care. - Hi, Benjamin, it's Allen. I have a favor to ask. I'm looking for an actress named Celia Ford. She's from my hometown. Apparently, she was having some trouble with her father. My brother wants me to get in touch with her. Think you can help me out? Yeah, you know, I'll look into it. - All right, cool. I appreciate it. I'll talk to you soon. - Jared's not using soap to wash his hands. - Yes, I am! - Hey, I told you all soap and water, and that's water on your hands. Not all over the floor, come on. Come on, guys. - Alrighty, Mom, I'll see you soon. I love you. Hi! Guess what! What? - My mom and dad are coming for Christmas! - Really? That's great. - They're gonna be coming soon, and they're staying until the 26th. Oh, I can't wait to see them. - You're kidding. Yeah, I can't wait to see 'em either. - Hey, listen, I know that my dad's tough on you. He just wants what's best for his little girl. - Baby, I know that. Who knows, maybe this time I won't be a complete disappointment to the man. - You won't. You are gonna be wonderful. Mm-hmm. - Oh my gosh. We need to clean. We need to clean the kitchen. We need to clean the guest room. We need to clean the house. I can't let my mom think I have a messy house. - No, no, no, no. With your dad coming, you know exactly where I need to start cleaning first. - The garage. Okay, listen. Wait, maybe we just don't even worry about any of this and we give them a hotel. - No, I wouldn't hear of it. Not your parents. - Oh. - And listen, we still got a couple of days. You don't have to panic just yet. - Okay. Start panicking. - Hey, Ben. - Hey, what's up, man? What's going on? - Thanks again for coming in early. I really appreciate it. - Sure. - I'm gonna really enjoy recording this new song. - Yeah, man. I look forward to it. - Oh, by the way I found Celia Ford. - Oh, great. Did you get her number? - Yeah. As it turns out, her manager's a friend of mine. - Perfect. I'll give her a call as soon as we're done. - Okay. You got her number, rest is up to you. - Let's get to work. - Absolutely. - Celia Ford? - Um, yeah. You must be the guy from Kentucky. - Yeah, hi, Allen Barnett. You know my brother George. - From church. Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. You mind if I sit? - Please. - Coffee, sir. - So what brings you to L.A.? - I came out here about eight months ago with my brother, and I was supposed to go back, but got caught up with my music. - And you're still here. - Yeah. But tomorrow I'm leaving, going back. - Oh. Well, tell George I say hey. - Did your manager tell you I wanted your number? - No, he just said he was doing some guy a favor. Some guy from Kentucky wanted to meet me. My manager is very shrewd. He likes being owed favors by people who can help him. I don't know. He's not like a very great manager, so. - They usually aren't. - So what did you wanna talk about? - Well, George called me a few days ago, and an old friend of his isn't doing very well. He thought having some family around for Christmas might help him out. Problem is, his only daughter lives in Los Angeles. His name is Don Ford. - What? - Look, I apologize for not being straightforward from the beginning, I just thought if we met and we could talk a bit, then you might be- - You thought that you could convince me into going back home with you? I'm sorry, you honestly thought that you could talk me into flying back to Kentucky with you? - I'm driving, actually. - That's worse. I don't even know you. Did he put you up to this? - No. This was George's idea. Look, he's a good guy and he means well. He wants to help people even if they don't want it. - Well, Allen, I am pretty darn sure that my dad does not want his help. And I know that I don't want yours. Look, if you need to hear it from me straight, no. I do not want to go back to Kentucky with you. - Here's my number. If you change your mind, I'm leaving tomorrow. - Well, don't hold your breath. - The key's not gonna work. You didn't pay rent for 2 1/2 months. - That's my hat. That's my bag. - My wife packed a few of your things. We're so sorry. We wanted you to have this. Please. - Thank you.

I've been meaning to do this for a long time. - Which is what? - Drive back home. Help people along the way. - I can dig that, man. Think this drive is gonna take you through Winslow, Arizona? - Supposedly. It's on the map. - Stop off at this clothing bank called Alice's Attic. Here. Give that to 'em.

How'd you end up in L.A.? - It's a long story. - We're driving across country. How long could it take? - Well, I was failing spectacularly in New York. Then my father died. And to get our inheritance, me and my brother had to take a cross-country journey, retracing the steps our parents took on their honeymoon. - Okay. Kind of weird, but okay. - There's more to the story. The plan was to thank folks that helped them after my father got his wallet stolen near Indio. When we finished the journey, me and my brother became brothers again, and I learned a few other things. - And when you got to Los Angeles, you stayed. For music. - Yeah, well, it wasn't the plan. - Plans. Yeah. We all have plans. - Yeah, well, my plan was to go back to Lexington. But here it is almost a year later, and I'm going back for Christmas. And I'll hopefully do a few good deeds on the way there. - So these good deeds, what are they? - You know, if somebody's hungry, you feed 'em. Find somebody on the streets, you get 'em a room for the night. That sort of thing. - Takes cash. - Cash I have. I figured it would be better put to use to help people that don't have it. - Am I one of your good deeds? - You're one of George's good deeds. I'm just here to give you a ride and stimulating conversation. - Twice in one week? I must really be on the short list at church. - Oh, come on, Don.

Come on in. So, what about Celia? - Oh, well, after we spoke the other day, I called Allen in Los Angeles. I asked if he could get in touch with her. They got together a couple days ago and spoke. And get this, he's convinced her to drive home with him for the holidays. Celia's gonna be here in time for Christmas. - She called you? - Oh, no, no, no, no. But Allen did. Oh, some great news, right? - So you did all this? - Well, yeah, yeah, uh, I did. - I'd just as soon you leave, George. - Why? Wait, wait, wait. You didn't hear what I said, Don- - No, I heard you fine. I want you out of my house. - No, what do you mean? Don, wait a- - Mind your own business. - What?

Great work, everyone. - I thought they fixed that. - Apparently not. - Denise. Good to see you. - Pastor John, the lights keep going on and off in the sanctuary. Sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other side, sometimes they go out completely. - We had an electrician look at it. It seems that there were some mistakes made in the wiring when we had the sanctuary renovated. - Well, we have to do something. Or we're gonna have the Christmas Eve concert performed in the dark. - Well, I'm sure it'll work out. - That was really nice, giving that donation at the clothing bank. I just wish we could've stayed there and done more. - The body has many parts, but all of its parts form one body. You give the cash, they give the clothes. There's those that sow and those that reap. - It sounds like you know your Bible. - Well, I should. I used to be in church every time the doors were open. - And what about now? - Pretty much left all that behind me. - Yeah, I left that behind me once, too. - And now? - And now, I believe I have a Savior. - Yeah.

Uh, you want me to help you with it or- - No, sir. I got it. - You all right? - No, no, I got it. I got it. - Okay. - Come on, guys, let's do this inside. It's freezing out here! Slow down. - Okay. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hot chocolate's in the kitchen, it stays in the kitchen. - Oh, thank you. - Thank you, dear. - Almost had a disaster. - Thank you. George, you need any help with that? No! No, I think I got it. - Honey, well, you could've put us on the first floor. We'd be out of the way. - Oh, Bob, hush up. You can still climb the stairs. - And there's a Red Roof nearby. So, how's it going? - Well, you know, life's been a blessing. It's been hectic. And for some crazy reason, I have decided to direct the Christmas Eve concert. - Wow. - And you know what? It's turning out to be a complete disaster. - I remember Christmas show disasters. There was this one year, Jimmy Roberts' wise man robe fell apart. - He was a little pear-shaped kid, wasn't he? - We had to use a stapler to put it back together. - Maybe you could help us. We lost our lead soloist, and the electricity might go out in the sanctuary at any moment. - Well, that's a bit more difficult than a wise man's robe. - Well, speaking of wise man, I was looking at your manger there, you got the wise men, but there's only one shepherd, what is that? - Oh, that's how George likes to set it up. - Well, that's taken care of. - Hey, honey. Here, have some hot cocoa-co. - Thank you, sweetheart. So Bob, I noticed you were admiring my manger scene over here, what do you think? - Yeah, I was just wondering, there's only one shepherd. You know, shepherds tending their flocks. - No, that's just the way I've always set it up. Ever since I was just a little boy. - Oh, what, you lose the other shepherds when you were a little boy? - No, sir. I didn't. That's the way the set came. - Oh, I see, well, I thought maybe a shepherd's union problem. - Okay, Bob, hush. You know, you just keep setting it up the way you do it, George. Don't pay any mind to Mr. Fussy Britches over here. - Uh, you know what? You stay and spend some time with your parents. - Okay, honey. - I'll take care of this. - Thank you. - He's not mad, is he? I noticed your guitar. You any good on it? - I guess so. They pay me. - Just to play? I'm sort of gun for hire. I play for people recording their songs. You ever record any of your own? - No, but I'd like to. What's stopping you? My songs. They're not ready yet. - Maybe you're your own worst critic. You should play me something sometime. - I don't think so. - Come on. Don't be shy. It isn't that. They're Christian songs. I doubt you'd like them. Mm, well, yeah.

I know you're teasing, but I couldn't have said it better myself. - What's this? - My Christmas song. - So you do have a Christmas song. What, are you gonna sing it for me? - Yeah, I don't sing. I can't carry a tune. - It's interesting. The second verse doesn't match the first, but- - Yeah, it was because I wrote the second verse. - Who wrote the first verse? - Well, I believe God did. It just kinda came through me like a gift. And I've been trying to match the second verse ever since. - Maybe that's how life is, you know? God gives you a first verse, and it's up to us to write a second. - It sounds like you haven't lost your faith after all. - I turned away. Have you thought about turning back? - What if He's not there? - He'll be there. ♪ Hark the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ Glory to the newborn King ♪ - This has always been my favorite time of year.

Freely you have received, freely you shall give. What's that? - Um, something that I need to remember. Thank you. - Hey. You never know what a coat can do. - Found the man in charge. They appreciate the donation. Great. - Good day. Gave her your coat? - Oh, it's fine. We have heat. That was nice of you. - What? - That was just really cool of you. Giving that woman your coat. - Somebody gave it to me. - Gave it to you? I thought you said you bought it. - I said I got it. I didn't say I bought it. Allen? It's not obvious? I don't have any money. The lady at the clothing bank gave it to me. And... My lease wasn't just up, either. I was evicted. I was on the street when I called you. I just didn't have anywhere else to go. When I saw that young woman, I saw myself, and I just couldn't let her spend a cold night without a coat. - Hey. - Hi, you're home for lunch. What a treat. - It's better than that. They got the Christmas party this afternoon, so I decided to come home instead. - Okay, well, I made some sandwiches for the kids. Would you like one? Yes, I would. - What is that? - That is, that's my dad. He is making a small stable so we can have a nativity scene for our front lawn for Christmas next year. Please, just let him do it. He wants to. It's fine. It's fine. You know what, I'll thank him for it later. - And that is gonna get you an extra handful of potato chips. Come on. Bob, what are you doing? - Well- - Ah, come on, Bob. What? Bob, listen. I don't mind you using my tools, I don't. And I don't mind you using my garage. Go ahead. But you've rearranged everything. I'm never gonna be able to find anything. - Well, I'm just trying to square away the clutter, that's all, you leave this lying around. - But it's my clutter, Bob. Like I know where everything's at out here. - How could you? - You know what, you do whatever you want to out here. Have at it. I got bigger problems to deal with anyway. - Hey, George, George, whoa. What's wrong, you having problems with Denise or the kids or something? What's going on? - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, there's nothing to worry about. They're fine. Thank the Lord for that. It's just I've been... You know what? You don't wanna hear about this. - Oh, come on, George. What's going on? - All right. Well, it's this friend of mine. He's been going through a pretty rough patch lately. - Hmm. - His wife, she passed away last year, and he and his daughter sometime after that had a big falling out of some sort, I don't know. But she got angry and took off to Hollywood. They've been estranged ever since. The holidays have come up, and it's just, ah, it's just really hitting him hard. And I thought, you know, what a great present it would be if I can reach out to her and get her to come back for the holidays, right? Well, I did, and she's coming back. She's gonna be here in time for Christmas. So I go over to give them the good news. The man got mad at me and he kicks me out of the house for doing this. - Well, maybe it's his mess and he wanted to take care of it himself. Huh? Ever consider that? - Okay. Yeah, maybe. - Well, maybe he's just angry because she did something for you that she wouldn't do for him. - What's that mean? - Well, maybe... They were estranged you say? - Right. - Right? They're not talking. So much less her coming out here, and then you call her up and she comes here, she's here? Maybe it hurt his pride. - That doesn't make any sense, Bob. I mean, that's completely irrational. - Yeah, well. - Really. You don't think she's gonna show up here and he's gonna turn her away at the door. - Well, I don't know him. I don't know what they're like. But I know like if it were Denise... I never told you this, but when she was teenager, we had a big fight. And she wouldn't speak to me for weeks. And I was just, at first I was angry. And then I wanted to forgive her and have her forgive me, but she just wouldn't talk to me. And then one day I came home from work and she's sitting on the porch. And she comes down to the car and she puts her arms around my neck, just not a word, just hugs me. One of the best days of my life. So, I don't know. It'll probably be a bumpy ride when they get here, but just have to pray that their love will see them through that. Hmm? - Yes, sir. Thank you. I'll be praying for him. Yeah. You do that. - There must be an electrician who can come over and fix this. - I've called everyone. It's just too close to Christmas. - Believers, nonbelievers, everyone takes this week off. - It's like a light show in there. It's brighter on one side, dimmer on the other. And then they all just go out. - Is that dangerous? - No, honey. Well, I don't think so. - Wait a second. My brother. He knows sort of an electrician. His name is Merle. - Sort of an electrician? Isn't that like sort of being a NASCAR driver? - Yeah, Veronica, how sort of is he? - Well, he wired his farmhouse out in Nicholasville. I'm not sure how that turned out. - But is he licensed? - I think so. I mean, wouldn't he have to be? - No, not necessarily. - Well, I think we better be sure. Get him over here. The sooner the better. - It's weird. He didn't pick up. I hope he's okay. - Yeah. I'm sure he's okay. I have a confession to make. - What do you mean? - Well, since you told me about some difficult things about yourself, I thought I'd be honest with you. I had promised to make this trip months ago. I just didn't want to. I wanted to stay in L.A. and play my music. - Why didn't you then? - I convinced myself that I could do that and serve the Lord. You know, write Christian songs and play my music. - That still sounds like a really good life. - Yeah, I guess so. Then every Sunday I started just coming up with excuses not to go. My songs became less about the Lord. Then my pastor called me and asked me to be part of the music program, and I came up with some lame excuse not to do it. - Is that when you realized you weren't serving the Lord? - My brother called me. He wanted me to come home. And then he told me about you and your dad. But I said no. - I know you did. But somehow I knew you'd come around. - So you did have faith. - Yeah. I did. - So I've got the guest bed ready for Celia, and the sheets are downstairs on the couch for Allen. - Good. - Do you know when they're gonna get here? - Allen called from Mt. Vernon, Illinois, so I'm expecting they should be rolling in here in a couple hours. I hope so. - All right. Well, then I'm gonna go to bed. - Okay, yeah. Go, go now.

Good to see you again. Been a while. - Yeah, look at the beard. Looking good. - Well, it comes, it goes. - Yeah. Hi. - Hey. Wow, look at you. - Thank you for letting me stay. - Absolutely. And this is my pleasure. Hey, guys, listen. We need to keep it down. Everybody's sleeping upstairs, all right? - But you guys want anything? You want something to eat? - Uh, some sleep. - Okay. - Yeah, we've got you a nice warm nightgown and a coat upstairs back in our guest room for you. - Oh, thank you. Here's yours. Come on, come follow me right this way. - Well, she gets the guest room bed. We got you set up on the sofa. It's this way. - Did you hear from Don Ford? - Yeah, no. - Well, Celia called him, but he didn't answer. I didn't wanna say anything. - Well, you know what, maybe he was just asleep. Just leave it up to the Lord. It'll be all right. Yeah. - You couldn't sleep either, huh? I've just got so much on my mind. The young woman in St. Louis. Seeing my dad tomorrow. - It's been an eventful day. - I think they're out. - Yeah. They woke up and came downstairs. Wanted to hang out with their Uncle Allen. I think the guitar put 'em back to sleep. - I heard you playing when I came downstairs. - I'm just noodling around. - Is that what you call it? - It's a musical term. - Let's hear your song. The one with the flawed verse? - Mm-hmm. I wanna hear it. - All right.

Thanks for singing my song. - Anytime. Pancakes, pancakes, pancakes. - We need more syrup. - And extra butter on mine. - And George makes the best- - George. - Yeah? There's a mutiny at the kids' table. You might wanna check in on it. - Hey, Allen, how are you? Good to see you again. Good to see you, Bob, Ellen. - Hi. - You pack a comb this trip? - It's too early, Bob. I haven't had my coffee yet. - The bacon smells so good. - Oh, yes! Here we go. Thanks, George. - Mm-hmm. That should keep 'em quiet for just a bit. - Hey, good morning. - Good morning. - Morning. - Morning, Celia. - Celia, this is my mom and dad. Ellen, Bob. - Hey, Celia. How are you? Just staying for Christmas. - Merry Christmas, sweetheart. - Nice to meet you. So how did you sleep? - Great. Thanks. I just spoke with Dad. I told him I'd come over after breakfast if that's okay? - Oh, sure. Yeah. We'll take you over right after. Okay, Allen? - Right after breakfast. Well, let's say grace. - Heavenly Father, bless this meal as it nourishes our body. Thank you for the Lord Jesus. Thank you for our home, our family, and all of our blessings. Watch over the needy. And good Lord, thank you so much for bringing my brother Allen and Celia home back to us safe. Amen. Amen. - So we were both in Los Angeles, and my manager gave this guy my number. And so we met at a diner, and he told me that he was coming back to Kentucky for Christmas. So then I called Allen, and I asked him to bring me home. - Asked me? - Mm-hmm. - I remember it as more of a demand. No. - So Denise, George tells me you're music director. How's the Christmas concert going? Oh. Yeah. Well, we finally found someone to fix the electrical issue. Now all we need to find is a singer to replace our soloist for tomorrow night. - You know, I just remembered, Bob and I have an errand to run. - Uh, let me finish my coffee. Well, I don't need coffee. - Excuse us. - All right. - Excuse us. See you later. - Okay. - Denise, I might have an answer to your soloist problem. Celia here is an amazing singer. - No, I am not really that good. - Well, why don't you come by for rehearsal tonight? If you would feel comfortable with that. Well, yeah. - Okay. I've only got my pride to lose. - Wow, that would be an answer to our prayers. - I'll pick you up from your dad's. - Speaking of which, we need to get you over to your father's. Come on. Let's go. - Okay, we'll see you tonight then. Thank you. Thank you. - Thanks for the pancakes, George. - I sure hope Don doesn't mind you leaving early for rehearsal tonight. Was sort of a last-minute request. - It's the church choir. Sure he'll be fine with it. - Well, good. I'll pick you up at seven then. - Thank you so much. See you tonight. Okay. - I'm so glad to have you home. - It's good to be here. - I was making some hot tea. Let's get inside and get warm by it. - Well, George, looks like God's plan worked out. - Yeah, well, those are the ones that always do. ♪ Be still ♪ ♪ Oh, be still ♪ ♪ Oh, be still ♪ - This is perfect! - Yeah. Perfect for you, you don't have to lift these boxes. But you know, sometime you're gonna have to explain to me why you do the things you do. - Now, where would be the fun in that? Besides, you already know what I do. - Yeah, I know. But you never know how much longer I'm gonna be able to lug all your crazy ideas around. I'm not as young as I used to be. - Bob, we are just getting better. And what you can't lift in one way, you lift in another. 'Cause that's the man I married. Sometimes you even surprise me. - Oh, surprise you? That'll be the day. Did you know that it is 78 in Fort Myers? Get in the car. - I could be on the porch sucking up a sweet tea. - It's funny what you remember from your childhood. I remember I played with you and Mom when you sat in the kitchen. I'd run in, blow you kisses, run out. - And we'd blow you kisses right back. That's from me and your mother. - Freely I receive. I'll be back in a few hours. - You need to move back home. You can stay here till you get settled. There, I've said it. You need to do as I say. - Do as you say? Dad, I don't have any say in this decision that you've made. - You know that I'm right. - There's Allen. I have to go. - We'll talk more about this when you get home. - You've said enough. - You need to do as I ask. You need to do as I ask. - So, how'd it go? - Went okay at first. Right before you got there, the questions started about what I should do next. - What's wrong with asking questions? He's just concerned about you. - It's not the questions, Allen. It's how he asked them. Are you taking his side? - No. I just think you should honor your father. I mean, he loves you. - Yeah, well, fathers shouldn't exasperate their children. And I'm exasperated. - Look, I'm on your side. - You better be. Oh, beautiful, guys. - Oh, honey, you were great. You have a fabulous voice. - Oh, it sounded like there was an angel singing in here. - We have an answer to one crisis. - Hallelujah! - The choir helped. - So what do you think? Are you in? - Please. Come on. - Yeah, yeah. It'll be fun. Yes! - Merle! How's the electricity coming? - Well, what you got is a 100-amp breaker box. What you really need is a 200-amp breaker box to be able to handle all these newfangled lights in this sanctuary. - English, please? - You need more power. Now, I fixed you up. I went ahead and rerouted all the lights from the kitchen into the sanctuary. Sanctuary is looking good. But you've got no dishwasher, no refrigerator. My ambrosia! - That's Merle? - That's Merle. - I like him. Huh. Looks like the lights are out. - Yeah. He probably went to sleep. - I'll pick you up tomorrow afternoon? - Okay. Hey. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Why are you sitting in the dark, Dad? I couldn't sleep. Just keep thinking about you and your mother. - I love you, Dad. And I loved Mom. But I'm gonna go my own way. And if that means staying in Lexington, so be it. But if I need to go to Los Angeles or New York, I'm gonna do it. - Your mother was so worried when you left for Los Angeles. Doctors say that she died of a heart attack, but they were wrong. She died of a broken heart. - You know, I remember this conversation.
