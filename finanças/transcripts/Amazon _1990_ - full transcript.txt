Subtitles by your friend, Quester f-CLOSED f-Finnish Tule pois sieltä! (Get out of there!) Come on, come on. Let's go. (Dan's voice) He knew he was looking for trouble, hitting the Transamazônica Highway with two little girls and no money. And it scared him. But we each have different ways of going from point A to point B. You know, the line may be straight, smooth, or jagged and broken. It all depends, I guess... ... on a lot of things. Papa please. We should have been in Manaus a long time ago. You're on the wrong road. No, I know what I am doing. We're heading due North. Believe me. Me? I believed in luck. Kari? He believed in destiny. On a map, his A to B put him on a skinny black line cutting across an endless wall of green. In the real world, it was a red, dusty nightmare headed for nowhere. We have to stay here all of the night. Close all of the windows and the doors. -I want to get out. -No, we stay inside, all of us. Please Papa, we can't just sit here all night. There are no tigers or anything outside, -Can't we just open a window? -No. But it's so hot. f-en halua kuulla sitä.! (I don't want to hear it!) I'm sorry. I don't know what's out there, but whatever it is, I don't want it in the car. Now try to get some sleep. f-Jatkaa. (Go on.) This was a guy that once had everything. A job, home, a wife and children. A life that was perfect. But the fates have their ways. They spin the thread, give you a length, then cut it off. In one terrible moment, his perfect life changed. She was American living in Finland. And when they met, It was love at first sight. She made him to the happiest man in the world. The end came in one, final act of love. So he ran. Carrying not much more than the guilt on his back, and two frightened little girls. He ends up in ~Brasil~, Where he figures they won't bother to look for him in Rio de Janeiro, of all places. -Change money? -No, change lives. -But we need money, Papa. -Yes, you are right. Just a second. Hey! He lost most of his savings. Tried to find work, but nobody wanted him. He just didn't know the system, or the right people. You look at the postcards and brochures and Rio looks like paradise. Yeah, but no money and no friends to turn to it might as well be hell. f -Para caralho. (For fucking.) -I don't need your fucking bullshit. -You're merely a freak! f-Seu filho da puta! (You mother fucker!) Things were getting pretty desperate. Then Francesco, a kid from the slums Kari had met on one of his sleepless nights, came to him with a deal. Can you drive? Of course. You can drive with me. I have a job. Two weeks. Why do you ask me? You must have friends who need a job. I no longer have many friends. The Favela people don't get to be old and those that get old you can't trust them. And you trust me because I look so naive. Oh, no. I couldn't leave my children alone in this place Bring them to me. They can live with my family where it's safe. In my ~pantano. (i.e. flophouse.) Francesco da Silva? f-Ele é os (~That's him) f-Francesco,as pessoas aparecer! (People are here!) Hey, gringo. Say girls, who's this? Come here. You found me. f~Congrats. OK. Come on. I will show.. I will show you the room. Come on. Come on. What are you doing? For our mission. Let's go. Now let's go. But first. One thing. What's in these? Matches. Matches and cigarettes. Okay? For the Garimpeiros (prospectors). You know Garimpeiros, the gold diggers? In the mines, that's worth more than gold. Uh huh. No. What's really in here? Cocaine? Don't ask too many questions. OK? Don't stop, OK. Don't stop. That is police. Go through! Go through! f-Policia. Bata a sujeira! (Police. On the ground!) I'm an American. I'm an American! f-Ouviste? Este é apenas um tolo americano (Hear that? He's just an American fool) Go..Go! f- (speaking indigenous dialect) Hey!...Hey! Hey!! (Engine stalls) (Engine catches) Piece of shit. Junk pile of garbage. Always on the last leg. The last few fucking miles. f-Caralho! (~Dammit) Thank you for landing. It was a... Don't thank me for anything. I didn't land for you. I ran out of fuel. God dammit. Piece of garbage! What's so funny? We ran out of fuel too. What'd you expect? A friendly gas station and rest area every 500 kilometers? This is Transamazonica, pal. The jungle. Imbecile. -Knock it off! You're an imbecile -Lea! Oh, she's right. You're just as stupid as we are because you don't have any fuel either. In fact, even stupider because you should have known better. You stand up for yourself. I respect that. But you're wrong about one thing. I got fuel. Do you really think it will run on casassa (moonshine)? Do you really think I know a thing or two more than you turkeys? Why are you so rude? I'm not rude, just unfriendly. It's the same thing. Look, my father asked you a sincere question. Only the airplanes haven't been converted to booze. Just the pilots. How old are you? Too young for you. No kidding. Looks like a dinosaur, doesn't it. It's big. It's big as the biggest dream. One of thousands they just left sitting here after trying to build that impossible highway. I'm going to teach it to walk again. That's totally crazy. Crazy, huh? Do you know what you can do with a caterpillar out here? There's gold here. I mean not here, but in Huran. They dig it from the earth by hand. But me, I'm gonna use this yellow dream treasure. And one day it'll be enough for 100 years. Some day. When I have enough time. Do you have a dream to become rich? I've had other dreams. But they weren't selfish enough. And what are unselfish dreams like? The kind that get you killed. Where are you flying to? Jacareacanga, up North to the mines. Well, nice chatting with you folks. You got enough casassa to get to the next Indian settlement. You go straight on, you an buy some more there. I want to go to the north. I want to dig for gold. Look, why don't you go to Copacabana. You rent a room, a nice shower. Take your little girls on the beach. We can't go back. We aren't tourists. Please ...? How much can you afford? Nothing. Haven't any more. Not right now. We have to fly with you. You have nothing to lose. You want this? Okay god dammit. Let's go. No, I don't want you to get the wrong idea about me. I wasn't doing the angel with a dirty halo bit. The guy looked like a mope. But I had a feeling about him. Nothing I could predict, but I had some angles I was working out and he gave me the vibes. That's how it was in those days, always hustling. So where are you people from anyway? Finland. Finland? A long ways. And where is ..? This is Nina and that's Lea, and my name is Kari. What's your name anyway? Dan. Dan. Pleased to meet you, Dan. Pleased to meet you, Kari. Where the hell did you get your license anyway? I bought it. What else? Here they believe every American was a pilot in Vietnam. And if you give them a few hundred dollars, well they even write out a certificate. Say Dan, if you didn't run out of fuel would you really have passed us by and let us starve? Well I'll tell you girls, each dead tourist down here is an ecological asset to the forest. Why did you fly the big loop then? I'll bet that if you wouldn't have flown it you would have made it all the way to your caterpillar. Well if I'd have known you guys were so young I wouldn't have flown it. Doesn't it ever end? Way up. The Indians say that the Amazon is as long as your life. You'll never reach the end of it. And what do the pilots say? I don't give a flying fuck in the end. Why don't you dig for gold here? First of all, I'm a pilot not a gold digger. Secondly, I like women too much. What do you mean? This. What's in here? It's mercury. Pure poison. And gold diggers use it. And what does mercury to do with women? Well when you stand around in mercury all day not much happens from there down, if you know what I mean. Well I'm not interested in women anyway. If you're not interested in women you better learn pretty quick. You got two little girls to take care of. I will take care of them. Come on in. Nothing in here is going to bite you. Make yourselves comfortable. I haven't been home in a while, you know. So it, uh, it needs a woman's touch. You play piano? That was here before I got the place. It's too romantic with me, I guess. I'm not too keen on music. f-Portugese -Eu. =Eu. (I). -Você. =Você. (You). -Mao. =Mao. (Hand). -Olho. =Olho (Eyes). -Olhar =Olhar. (Look). f- Olhar. (Look). (Dan's voice) Serra Pelada. That means "naked mountain". Couldn't describe it better myself. A scar of destruction in the Earth, like Dante's Hell. And the miners, the condemned. Searching for a retribution they'll never find. The mercury they spew on the Earth takes it's toll. First, the trees.. and then the men. So, there he was. A straight shooter type. Someone I could trust to share my vision. But the diamond was a problem. This poor bastard's thinking he's found his ticket out. His escape from purgatory. I figured he didn't trust me much but that was OK. Nobody's perfect. Son of a bitch, He was so full of hope sitting there digging with that freaking stone. Didn't have the heart to tell him that hope was a luxury nobody could afford in the Amazon. Of course he'll cheat me. He's no idiot. He's a trader, every trade is a swindle. But all will swindle, given the opportunity. You stole that diamond from the company, didn't you? But if you went to my friend he'd rob you. And then kill you afterwards. Then he and his friends and his owner would roast you on their grill for supper. I tell you Kari, with your diamond and my caterpillar I could show you how to make some real money, partner. Thanks, but we have other plans. Have it your way, pal. Here we are. -That's a hotel? -Five star. Rent me a room with air conditioning, bath, color TV, and kingsized waterbed. In fact, you know what? You should make it the royal suite because there the cockroaches they all got little crowns on their heads. But for now I get to work for you. I'll be back in one hour. f-Pesa muito, (It weighs a lot,) mas é de qualidade inferior. (but is of inferior quality.) Eh. Não é bom. (Nah. It's no good.) Son of a bitch! I tell you girls, your Papa is an idiot. f-Obrigado. (Thanks.) f- Alô, porder sabes onde gringo, Dan? (Hi. We're looking for a gringo, Dan.) f-Obrigado. (Thanks.) Where is my money? Where is my money!? -f background arguing (Swine! Pig!) -Kari, hey. -Come on, girls. C'mere, man. Girls! Kari! Wait a second. Let me explain. Come here, god dammit! What? Are you going to walk to Finland? You'll get everything back a hundred times over. You made an investment. That diamond wasn't worth shit. Watch out! You saved our lives once. I won't forget it. Otherwise I would kill you. C'mon, we can be partners. I'll give you half of everything I own, god dammit. The plane, the caterpillar, all of it. Come on, asshole. The caterpillar is scrap iron. And you're plane is scrap iron. And you are scrap iron. We have 300 kilometers of pure gold and diamonds man, for us. f-Copanheiros? (Partners) Fifty-fifty? Fifty-fifty. What a joke. you made..you made it on purpose, yeah? I did it on purpose, Kari. Okay..Okay. -Okay. Let's be partners. -Partners. Let's be partners with this fellow maniac, ha. (Dan's voice) So hope took us north, to Tepequem. My storybook village on top of a volcano. They say you barely have to scratch the earth to find diamonds. I haven't found any. See that here? That's the Monte de Garrafas, Old volcanoes. "The mountain of bottles". -How are you doing? f-Estou bem. (I'm Okay) Kari, this is Paola. Hi. Could you do me a favor and watch these two little girls for a couple of hours? f-Tudo bem. (That's fine.) f-Obrigado. (Thanks) Okay. Jump down. What are your names? -Leah. -Nina. Do you want some food? -Yeah. -Okay. That's Julius Cesar. Seven years ago he clambered up on this old volcano and stayed. The first gold digger. First guy who failed. Here on the earth where it looks like a new land. I mean, not at all like the other mine. Nothing has been destroyed. That's because here the land takes care of itself and makes asses of everyone. In the winter, the rains come and covers this whole mess right up. Fills in all the holes as well. So in the Spring everything looks like has for a thousand years of every springtime. And then it begins again, all the digging. Who owns this land? It's uh, well everything belongs to everybody. It's free land. f-Para de la locais. (For the locals) A couple of years ago the government gave it back to the Indians. But uh, they failed to make it official so it's up for grabs. Do they use mercury here? Not necessary. That's for gold. This is a diamond mine. You got a 150 kms to the Venezuelan border. It's a 150 kms of per jewels. Diamond country. Can you imagine what we can get out of here with my caterpillar? Excuse me. I mean our caterpillar. Alright. How are you going to get our caterpillar up here? I figured it out exactly. Come on. How long do we need? A month, by flying people supplies. Another month to get the dino here. Is there an easier way to raise up the money? Sure. But none I could live with. We could run drugs for the cartel. Columbia is a hop, skip, and a jump from here. We can see where the road ends. All we need to do is tow the caterpillar these last couple of hundred meters. We get a few of these fake Indians to help us out and in a couple of days, we're up. Or, we fall down once and for all. It's always possible. But if we manage it ... If we manage it we've got the diamonds below and the stars above. Oh, thank you. And thank you very much for taking care of the kids. f-De nada. (You're welcome) Where are the girls tonight? Oh, they are sleeping over there. -f-Tudo bem Mais zilla? (That's OK. More beer?) -f-Si. Obrigado (Yes. Thank you.) Mama mia ...! So, we put the dino on the pontoons and it's up to here on Amazonas, then Rio Negro and Rio Branco. Then we're there. Sounds fucking exciting. Ha, with total boredom. Sometimes you can't see anything. Not even see the riverbank. Just humid air for a 10 mile week. Then we'll come to a narrow stretch and again we see nothing. Not even Indians. But they'll see us. We'll be the big attraction for them. They're along the sides in the forest. They got nothing better to do on their miserable reservations but sit around until they get the next white man's disease. You're a badass fatalist. Nuhn. More of a realist. Maybe too cynical, but, Look, I'm American. I see things the way they are. The Indians live in the Stone Age. but they're sitting on the natural treasures of modern times. And sooner or later everybody needs it. That's their time bomb. They got no chance and never had any. -f (Hostile negotiating) Who were they? Ah, losers. But they're our first customers. 500 bucks. -Let's have a drink. -That's a good idea. -f-Paola! Cachaça por favor (local beer) -E com limão, por favor (With lemon, please.) And what will you do if they don't pay? Well, I'll kill them if they don't. Thanks. -f-Bom dia (Good day) -Bom dia. -f Onde está Paola? (Where is Paola?) f-Paola? A bonita? (The cutie?) -Si (Yes). -f-Ah. Na escola. (Oh. At the school.) -Abrigado. (Thanks) =f♪ (If you're happy and you know it clap your hands..) I'm sorry, I didn't know. Sorry? Have you come to learn something? You could use it. f-Ele muitos burro. (~He's just a baby burro.) f-The gentleman knows none of our stories. But he is a white man. f-Continue the reading please, Luisa f-(Reads aloud without Kari understanding.) f-Thank you, Luisa The legend of Tepequem. Nothing would calm the volcano down. The fire gods destroyed all of the crops. In order for the tribe to survive the Tribal Chief decided he must sacrifice the tribes 3 most beautiful girls. After the girls jumped into the volcano, the volcano calmed down. And the lava turned into diamonds. And that's the legend of Tepequem. This is the first house in the village. It belongs to Julio Cesar and his family. -f-Julio por ai? (Is Julio around?) -No trabalho (At work) f-Ah, obrigado. (Thanks) He's in the garimpo. (mine camp). Come. f-Obrigado. (Thanks). You like this place very much, don't you. There's a reason they write legends about it. It's as close to paradise as I think I'll ever find.. And I'm afraid if you guys get you're way, it won't be paradise anymore. You wouldn't want to make the fire god angry, would you, Kari? Who, me? No. -f-Oi, Julio. (Hi) -Oi. f-Seja um tiambua (~Join the team) f-Sé bom? (It's good?) f-Sim. Trabalhos mucho. (Yes. It always works out) No miracles. You want caterpillar up here? Yes. You are fool. It's not possible. But, go right ahead. I was the first here. All was wood. All wood in horizon. I dig good with my hands here. I found diamonds. And the others came. We found diamonds. And we burned the wood down. And then the machines came. More diamonds, more people. And one day the caterpillar will come. Much more diamonds, but no people. Not now, not you. Why not me? You are alone with your crazy pilot. It's no time for people alone. And crazy. But go ahead, ha. Can't sleep? Yes. And no. I mean, not right now. It's my sleeping potion. Would you like some? Yes, thank you. -Thank you very much. -You're welcome. Fine stars here. Back home we have only the North Star. There it is. What? The North star. Oh, really? That one. It's here too? No, it's up there. And we're always down here. But you have to look carefully before spotting it. Spotting what? That we're quite alone here. Yeah, totally alone. And what else? Then it falls. Falls? Really. When? In about a hundred years or so. It keeps sinking nearer and nearer to the North Pole. And when it gets close enough, it's set to rise higher and higher. In 13,000 years it won't be our guide any more. -Too bad. -No, not at all. Then Vega will be our guide, our new North star. The stars take care of themselves. And we will always be down here, to watch them rise and fall. No. Then the machines will gaze at our stars. With their steely, empty eyes. Machines like your caterpillar. Do you have any idea what it is that you're doing? I don't want to know. Not right now. Then you already know. Brother. Good night, Kari. (Dan's voice) Paola took care of the girls. And we flew day and night trying to scrape enough money together to fix the caterpillar. And start digging. Hey, uh. Can you say "wimbowé"? -- "Wimbowé". -- "Wimbowé". That's it. Keep saying it.

You mean when he'd been in bed with Mom for the whole weekend? Yeah. Monday mornings were the funniest. Do you like Paola? The important thing is that Papa likes her. Maybe it will be fun again at home on Mondays f- FRIENDLY TOUR GUIDE FOR HIRE. Kari, wake up! Escusa (excuse me), Paola. f- Escusa Paola!? Meu burro. (Excuse me? My ass!) Hey, come on. Stay out of this, huh? No, you stay out of this Dan! Don't start any trouble here. Kari, move your ass. We gotta get started. I'll see you out there in a minute, alright? I'll be back soon. It's junk, Kari! Do you have any idea what it is you are doing? It's just one caterpillar. Just one. An old, rusted out tractor. But you know perfectly well it's just the beginning. Where one goes, others follow. Soon everybody will be sitting on a thing like that. And they won't even own it. The bank in Bela Vista will own it. Everybody will be a slaving for the bank on a stinking yellow tractor. Hey, what's going on out there? It's a funeral. A family. They were found half buried in the forest. Murdered? Who did it? Your first customers. Those three Garimpeiros. How else were they supposed to get the money for the flight? What's wrong? I don't know if that we are doing the right thing. Well, It's a little too late for us to have doubts. Come on, forget about it. Have a drink instead. I feel pretty good about this. But it's getting serious. I feel like some kind of... ...bomber pilot. Bomber pilot? It's a Hell of a lot different, I can tell you that. What I mean is that i am flying here on a feeling.. ..like raping the jungle. Raping, my ass. We're a couple of down & outers just trying to survive, like the rest of the world. This is her talking, isn't it? -No, you got it all wrong. -Yes, it is. Come on. -Admit it. It's her talk. -That's wrong, all wrong. I mean you're afraid that she's not going to love you anymore because we're driving a freaking caterpillar into a doll's forest. Is that it? Want to turn around? Huh? Want to go back, bury yourself in her hair, and tits, crawl up into her womb and forget about everything? That what you want to do? -Yeah, that's exactly what I want. -Yeah, exactly. It's too late now, pal. f-Tão achei. (Thought so.) Another shitty reservation. Why do you talk like that? Let them live in peace. It's not like.. Live? My ass, there's no life down there. Come on, Kari. Do you know what that is? It's.. It's a prison. And all those who take up the cause of the poor Indians, they're nothing but prison chaplains. Preaching to the condemned that death doesn't exist. But it does exist. What's the matter with you anyway? Every time the Indians turn up, you go nuts. What upsets you so much about them? -What upsets me so much? -Yeah, upsets you so much? Goddamn! Fuck the complicity whores and the moralists. They just want to spend a year with the wild ones before they start guzzling their fucking Coca-Cola, that's what upsets me so much. Who the Hell are we to tell them how to live.. ..when we took the first bite out of the apple? And now they're not going to be happy until every last living creature is expelled out of paradise. -That's what the fuck upsets me so much! -Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! -God dammit! Fuck you.

(Kari's voice) Last night in my fever, I saw the Indian's Dance of Death They told me I had to grieve for my dead. Otherwise I would die. So I cried. Not only for Dan. But for Susanne, my girls, and myself. It was long overdue. As days passed, I worried more and more about my girls. What I needed now was a new right leg, and the fastest way back to my children. Strange brand of humor. This damned brat with this ipecac. But I understood. I was born in Lapland, near the North Pole. And there we have Indians too. Or something similar. The Laps. They would have done exactly the same thing. That was all I was good for, a good laugh. But even when it was pouring out of me from both ends the thought struck me: I would rather be here than in some bank, counting other people's money. (Dan's voice) Kari never knew why I got so pissed every time he mentioned the Indians. Maybe I should have told him about my wife. She was a young Amaniú. Her name was Kahina, and we lived with her people. I wanted to be the savior for the Indians, for the forest. So I gave the tribe the guns they needed. But the white men had machine guns. And that was the end of the tribe. And my wife. I always hoped it would come to this. Although, something like this. The first time I saw you I knew you were right. 'Course, I was right. And how does it help me? (Dan's voice) I always believed, you thought something out, and then you did it. But that's not true. You do what comes. And what comes? The craziest things.
