Hey, Makky... Yea? We've known each other for over 3 months already, right? Is that so? Even so, I don't know where you live... Your cell phone number, e-mail address... I don't know anything. So that's why.. I.. I.. Hey Makky! Yes? Tell me your cell phone number and e-mail address? Huh? Let's trade with everybody. Hikari, get over here too. Hello. Hello. OK, write it on this. I.. I don't know my e-mail address at all. Fine, then send me a kara-mail (empty mail: you send a mail to someone and their phone sends you an automatic reply). Caramel? Just let me see it. I'll send it over infrared. Saki, you can't just play around with it without permission. Don't worry. Hey Sakurakoji, tell us yours too. OK. Makky Makky, I want to know too. What are you guys doing? Oh, Rumi. We're trading mail addresses with Maki. No way? Tell me too. I want to know too. This is like an old man's phone, isn't it?! Just kidding! We're just kidding, don't get so serious, Sakaki! You're so cute, Sakaki! It's great, you made up with Makky. What? It's not like we were fighting. You've been pretty friendly with Saki all of a sudden.. What? Like that has anything to do with you! You're the one who started it. Huh? Kantou Sharp.. Yea, it's me. My apologies for interrupting while you're busy.. It's time for the Executive Meeting. Got it, I'll be right there. What happened to the territory we lost to the Kumada? We cut our losses... But we don't make as much money. We were careless! Boss! What about the Shichiriya Gang? That Gondo guy is screwing around with a lot of places. Let's finish it before something troublesome happens. Right. If so, then I'll... In anycase, let's take care of this early on. When young gangs get into fights, there's no telling what will happen. The Kumada is still trying to team up with Gondo. The Kumada Family and the Shichiriya? There's no mistake. There was a fight at the 3rd block before. I can't read this, damn it. What's with the words looking like faces? Master. Oh, sorry. Continue. Alright. Before the Kumada can get to them, we'll obtain the Shichiriya Gang. They're a troublesome gang. That's exactly why. If we can't do this, it'll be too embarrassing. I understand. Let's do this soon... Akaiwa.. I leave this issue to you. Understood. I'll get them like my life depends on it. What's the meaning of this? Why didn't you leave this to me? This is my type of work. Hmm? I guess it was. Let me do it. I'll do it much better than Akai-something guy. Makio. From now on... Stay out of the gang's business. What? Why? You have school.. Don't screw around. I'm doing all of this for the gang- Have you forgotten the rules of the gang? The Boss's orders are absolute. For a while... Concentrate on just school. Turn off the T.V . Right. I don't care. I don't have any energy today. Master? Master, don't be so down. Boss wants you to enjoy your youth for the final six months. That's what he told me. So tell me... What is youth? Get youth! Get youth? No more! Dad.. Does he really intend to make me boss? Hey Sakura-something. There's something I wanna ask you. What is youth? Youth? In brief, youth is... Stuff like Love, Friends, and Friendship. But it has nothing to do with us during exams. Nothing? Yea. To adults we may look youthful. But from our standpoint, we're unconsciously doing it. What? Unconsciously? Well the Three Person Meetings did end. From now on, instead of "youth," it's about entrance exams. Just entrance exams? Where's the fun in that? Wha? Aniki! The hell are you doing? My Boss My Hero Knark52nd Dolis Random Emotion Timings from Tianj RAWs from gryzze I was always worried about you... I wanted to stay close to you.. I asked Boss and Kuroi-san. .Episode 6: Stand Up, Class Leader! The Fight Within Class A. Please, let me help here for half a year! So what's with the clothes, then? Well, actually I wanted to be a transfer student. "Hey, Kazu.." "We can't spend money on you, so buying you into school is impossible." That's what Kuroi-san said. So I'm working part time here. The hell.. I won't be a nuisance to you. Oh, and these! Aren't these Agnes puddings? Yup. I threatened the cafeteria guy and took them all. Please enjoy this all. That's not the problem!!! I'm sorry! - Agnes puddings.. - Yes.. - Should be obtained from running. - Yes. - There's meaning in getting them from running! - Yes. There's no meaning in getting them from cheating. I'm sorry! Don't look down on the limited sale puddings!! I'm sorry! I thought you'd be pleased! You returned them, right? All 12 of them sold out today at 12:00. Good. I shoulda eaten one.. Dammit.. Master, it's almost time for studies. For today.. It's about "Let's create 1192 (can be read as "ii ku ni" = good country) year in the Kamakura Goverment." A good country.. Master. I don't have the will to do it. I'm worried about the gang. Alright.. Let's work out in the dojo. One! Two! Three! Four! Aniki's on fire! That's right. Very unlike the guys from our gang.. The people in class 3-A... Know nothing about getting heated up. Are these guys really enjoying their youth? Alright.. It's been a while since I last had a pudding.. - Hey Sakaki.. - Yes? Let's go to the convenience store. Huh? But today.. I wanted the.. pudding.. Come with us. They told Hoshino-kun that he can't make it into any of the universities he wanted. He's being cranky right now. They said I wouldn't get in either. Are you bragging? - No! Um.. - Huh?! Shut up.. It's study hall right now you guys. Right. Can you quit fighting at your low level? For sure. Low level? You.. What? Are you gonna blame me for your stupidity? What the fuck. Step outside. Haha. A fight? Nice. - Sakaki-kun. You have to stop them. - Ok. What are you doing? Stop it. I know you guys are irritated with midterms coming. Fighting in class doesn't do anything. Enjoy yourselves more. You're only in high school once in life. There's only half a year left. Half a year left... "Sensei, I can't see the future." "Me right now, I can't have interest in neither a good country nor the Kamakura Government. "There's only one thing I'm interested in:" "Creating a good class." "Good class.." Sakaki-kun, why are you such a positive class leader? "Try your best in creating a good class." "I'll cheer you on with everything I've got." **Heart** What the?! I just wrote "heart" out of nowhere! What should I do?! I wrote it in pen. It won't erase! White-out! White-out.. white-out.. Principal, what's wrong? Yuri- .. I mean, Minami-sensei seems a bit different... Plus she's wearing a skirt. Hmm.. Maybe she's in love. What? Love? Love? Yuriko.. in love? Principal! Big trouble! Yes? "This is an emergency announcement from the cafeteria." "The sale of Agnes Puddings at noon have been cancelled." "I repeat:" "The sale of Agnes Puddings at noon have been cancelled." Why?!?! "I repeat:" "This is an emergency announcement from the cafeteria." "The sale of Agnes Puddings at noon have been cancelled." No way!! Why is there no pudding?! Please explain! Apologize!! This isn't funny! Well.. I don't know why they aren't here. I think you do know! Everyone calm down! Hey hey hey, everyone, hey! You stole them, you punk! No, no! From the information that I heard... The person who makes the famous Agnes Puddings.. Is a famous neighborhood farmer named Shimazaki-san. This Shimazaki-san arrives everyday at 11:30.. And delivers the 12 puddings to the school. But for some reason the puddings didn't arrive today. And they haven't been able to get in contact with Shimazaki-san. What the hell.. I did warm-up stretches for this.. Damn.. My pudding of youth.. And then, for some reason.. The next day's pudding didn't arrive either. The Autumn of 2006: St. Agnes Academy, who have been without pudding for 3 days now... Are suffering from a problem of lack of pudding. There is fighting amongst the students. And they've begun to talk about their sad emotions. It's time for exams.. But I've lost the will.. It will be alright. Cheer up. This is known as the "First Pudding Shock." Or something like that. Everyone's so glum. There are a lot of irritated students as well. It happens every year. Especially during the autumn of the 3rd year... Everyone gets really down because of the entrance exams. Really? It's because of times like these that the teachers must be on their toes. Yes, you're right. But this "Pudding Battle." Was one of the ways for the students to relieve their stress. We have to quickly find Shimazaki-san. What should we do to get everyone to feel better? Damn.. Don't like at me with eyes like those of a dead fish. Me? I'm in a lot of pain.. My dad.. Makky. Yes? Hurry and scale the fish. - By the way, Hikari.. - Yea? Have you e-mailed Makky yet? Nope. Why not?! After I went and asked him. I don't know what to write. Whoa, it just moved! It.. it just moved. - Makky. - Yea? You really have never cooked before? Why should he have to, huh?! I take care of all of Aniki's meals, dammit. Can I see that? Oh, please. You're good, Umemura-san. Really? She always cooks at home so her cooking is good, right? Hey. The smoke coming from your guys' area is annoying. It's because of your gross long hair, I don't feel like cooking, you disgusting long-haired freak. Delinquents like you wearing such cute aprons. Aren't you the disgusting ones? They're fighting again. Makky, cut these. Oh, Ok. Aniki with a knife! Sakaki-kun. You're holding the knife a bit wrong. No. Leave this guy to me. Whoa.. Japanese culture is awesome! Do it again, Sakaki-kun! Um.. That was amazing. It was nothing. Huh? Wait.. did I? I got a little happy for a second.. I'm almost there. I'll get the Shichiriya for sure. Good. It's totally different! It's gotta be soft and creamy dammit!! So sorry! "Youth has no enemies." "No enemies"? What's that? It's depressing, damnit. So what's wrong, you two? Nothing.. um.. There's stuff going on at my home.. And.. I can't see the future at all.. It'll be Ok, Sakaki-kun. No one can see the future. What? No one? Right, no one. You're still in high school right? There are still plenty of possibilities. Theres time to be lost.. There are dreams and hopes as well. Youth is real freedom. Freedom? Right. Don't decide your future already. Enjoy your time now. Did you enjoy your time? Yes. I had a lot of fun. Love, studies, friendship.. so much.. I can still remember it all today. Actually... You look just like him.. Hm? Huh? Oh, nothing. Listen. Enjoy your time now. You can't forget that. I see... Sensei.. I feel better now for some reason. What? Really? Yea. Now that I think about it.. I'm a guy who can't think more than 90 seconds. But I dragged it 3 days this time.. It wasn't like me. What! Only 3 days? Yea.. Right now, the "Will Barometer" in my body is... Girls praised me in class: 7 pts. I was in the same group as Umemura-san in cooking class: 10 pts. Tea and conversation with Mizushima-sensei: 10 pts. Sakura-something's kindness: 3 pts. Kazu's lunch: 1 pt. Total: 31 points. Hurray! I've reached the red level. Really? That's great. That Hoshino is freaking annoying. There's no way he's getting into college. True. Hey, which university are you trying for, Sawabe? Well, for me.. If it isn't the Idiot Group. What? Good timing. Lemme borrow your face. You've always annoyed me. That's sad. It's all about fighting for you. What was that? Go ahead. Hit me. I'll report you to a teacher or the chairman. That's dirty, you long-haired freak. And so what now? Huh? You guys, from before?! Damn! Dokuzeri High! Was it these guys? The guys that fucked with you guys before? What's with these guys? Stay put! It's been awhile.. So let's have a little chat together. Yea? Huh? Wasn't that..? Aniki, thanks for waiting. I'll make the perfect pudding for sure today. Yea, give me some energy.. Right. Oh yea.. There's a long-haired guy in A class, right? They got taken in by some bad looking guys. What? That's no good, is it? Nah, it's Ok. Those brats are pretty arrogant. Yea, you're right. "Try hard at making a good class." A good class? I guess I'll go over there. I am the class leader. But Master.. You can't use violence. Creating a situation before your graduation would be bad. Plus someone like you, Master... Shouldn't have to be involved with kiddy fights. No. I feel like getting rowdy. Whatever you say, I'm going. If so.. Get "that." Right. Hoshino-kun! Huh, he's.. so weak.. True... Hey, hey.. That's enough right there. Ok. Take care of these guys.. And let's go have some fun with these girls. Right?! Hold him down. Hold it! Who are you? Um... "Youth..." "Has no enemies!" Who is that.. weird guy? He's the hero from something... That's right, isn't he from "Anikinder"? He's cool. Go!! Fight! What's with these guys? Don't smile! (Talking to himself). Dammit... Don't forget this! Don't forget this! Don't forget this! Don't forget this! Aniki, helium! Wow.. Great! But is he an enemy? Or an ally? It's your guys' fault for getting us all caught up in this. Huh? It's because you're slow. Stop it! Let's all be friends. Let's enjoy youth. Let's stand up... Together. He's out of helium! What is this? It's smoke! He's gone! What the heck was that? Thank you, weird guy! Thank you, guy from "Anikinder." Thank you!! So hot!! Damn I'm tired! There's no ventilation in this thing, dammit! Sorry, it's homemade. Great job. But they weren't your enemies, right? But somehow.. I'm happy. I've been depressed since the gang replaced me. I saw those kids enjoying watching me.. It was kinda funny. Those kids actually want to have fun. But they don't know what to do.. Just like me. Me, now... That's yours.. You've got mail again. Just like usual, translate it into Japanese and reply to it. Right. So the sense of belonging of 3-A... - But Aniki.. - Shut up or I'll kill you. I'm talking a really nice conversation here! - It's Umemura-san. - Wha? To Sakaki-kun: Great work during Cooking Class... I'm going to make lunch sometime.. Would you like to go out? From Hikari. Aniki, that's a date invite. What, date?! It was so cool! Yea, he was so strong! He came on our crisis, it helped a lot! He was so cool you can't even imagine! I fell for him for a second. Makky? Makky, what's up? Ok... I'm going to enjoy my youth here. Huh? What? Youth? Love, Friendship, Learning.. I'll enjoy it all. What's this guy saying? What happened? I'm talking about youth, dammit! When you become adults you'll understand- Or so I believe... When you become adults there are no classmates. Yea? Cheat, being cheated, manipulating.. And lots of false bonds. But us... We're classmates. Enjoying our youth together. Friends no matter what. We.. We who are truly free.. What's gonna happen if we don't enjoy ourselves now?! Let's have fun together. Let's do our best together! Us.. Our faces, personalities, and grades are all different, but.. You guys.. Are all comrades who are struggling because you're not able to see your futures. Got it? Let's make a good class, 3-A dammit! An announcement to all students: The pudding maker Shimazaki-san, who had gone to Hokkaido... In order to research a better pudding recipe... Has returned to Tokyo today. Therefore, we'll be selling Agnes Puddings once again starting today. Because it's the first day, there will be 24; twice as many as usual. So I'll make a special condition: Each class will select 5 contestants. The first class to make it will get all 24 puddings. We'll begin promptly at 12:00. Have fun and join forces with your classmates. Sweet.. So the puddings are back... I'm gonna run. Everyone. Let's work together and try hard! Yea? Who wants to run with me? Let's run everyone. Everyone, let's go! Let's hurry up and eat that pudding! It's been a long time since I've had it, so I'm not really into it anymore.. We don't have to run, we could eat something else too.. Ok! I'll run. I want to try hard for my class. Umemura-san. Ok then. Try hard, you two. - Right. - Right. I guess it's just the two of us. Yea.. Oh, Umemura-san.. About that e-mail.. I still don't know how to properly write them. Makky.. Sakura-something.. Hoshino-san, too.. I won't let you be all cool. Jun, you don't like sweet things. It's been awhile, I want to make a memory from my youth. Makky.. Try your best and get that pudding. All we can do is cheer you on. Ok! Everyone ready? Ready.. Start! It's Aniki! Aniki, fight! Aniki, fight! Aniki, fight! Ibuki!! Go on without me!! Sakura-something, jump over me! We did it! Sakura-something! Look out! No way.. We did it! We did it! We did it! We won! Pudding! Awesome! Nice, Aniki! Viva youth. Awesome! Our Sincerest Apologies: The Brand New Agnes Puddings Are Sold Out For Today. Even for your side... I think it's a good deal. Mr. Sharp Fang.. We ain't acceptin' so damn easily. So this is the place? Who the hell are you? Let's go back. You some punk-ass underling trying to act all big? No, not at all. But Mr. Leader.. Teaming up with our organization is for everyone's benefit. Huh? The Sharp Fang is doing very good business nowadays. The hell?! You fuckin' around with us?! What are you trying to pull? Exactly as you see... It's time for my medicine, so I want to end this conversation quickly. With your numbers, it would take us 2, 3 minutes. - You bastard! - Knock it off! You've got balls. Let's listen to what you've got to say. I was acting from a movie I once saw. It actually worked. Looks like we've obtained this gang. We got the puddings! How nice.. I shoulda become one of the students. This is also the class' strength. Teamplay. - I mean.. This is.. - Ok everyone! Itadakimasu! He might become.. the class's and my hero. Itadakimasu.. Huh? Where's my... What? 24 puddings.. How many people are in our class? Excuse me, is mine still there? We have ours. This is good! Damn! Bitter. Just a bite.. Makky, Makky! Here, you can have mine. - Is it Ok? - Yea, I don't like sweet things. - Thank you. - Eat it. Delicious.. We got youth! Sakaki-kun, you were cool! Thanks for the puddings! "I'm looking forward to it. - Sakaki Makio." Knark52nd Dolis Random Emotion Timings from Tianj Raws from gryzze. Ep 7: Makio and Hikari's First Date?! Ep: 7 Makio and Hikari's First Date?! I want to be next to her, even if it's just for 1 second. I hate violence. It's unforgivable. If it was this painful, I should've never known youth.
