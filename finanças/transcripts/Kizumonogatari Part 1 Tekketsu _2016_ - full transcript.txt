( Sunday ) ( Friday ) A monochrome fade M O R E L I G H T ! this story about a vampire has a bad ending everyone is left unhappy at the end Kizumonogatari Iron-Blooded Arc 3. Hanekawa March 25th Naoetsu Private High School Entrance Uh... I- I didn't see anything. Naoetsu Private High School Entrance Y'know... Skirts don't provide enough security to hide what you want to be hidden. I should wear some shorts as a firewall, huh? S- Sure. Well, I gotta go. Wait, hold on! I finally caught up. You walk pretty fast... Araragi-kun. Araragi-kun How do you know my name? C'mon, of course I know it. We go to the same school. - Written with the "a" from "possibility," - 可 from 可能 A - two of the "ra" from "good kid," - 良 from 良い子 Ra - ra - ra And the "gi" meaning "tree." 木 from 樹木 gi Your given name is the "Koyomi" for "calendar." Koyomi Right? Hence, "Araragi Koyomi-kun." Araragi Koyomi You're... Hanekawa. Hanekawa Tsubasa. Hanekawa Tsubasa Wow. I'm amazed you know my name. You're the "Hanekawa Tsubasa" who, in our first trimester finals as sophomores, across all subjects including P.E. and Art, made only one mistake. Oh no, how do you know about that? Perhaps you've been... stalking me or something? Or am I being too paranoid? Not really. My alien friend told me. What? You have friends? At least question the "alien" part first! Well, it's just... You always seemed like you were in your own little world. You're right. I don't have any friends. That means you're so famous that even a loner like me knows who you are. Oh, stop it. I don't like those kinds of jokes. Hey, Araragi-kun. Hey, Araragi-kun. Do you believe in vampires? Why bring up vampires? Lately, some rumors have been circulating about there being a vampire in town. So you shouldn't be out alone at night. What a vague and baseless rumor. They say she's a beautiful blonde woman with eyes so cold, they send chills down your spine. That doesn't prove she's a vampire. What if she just stands out because she's blonde? But, while her blond hair glistened under the street lights, she had no shadow. You know, when it's nighttime, it's hard to see even if the street lights are on. Yeah, I also think it's a silly rumor. But if vampires really exist, I'd love to meet one. If only a superhuman being like that existed... "Superhuman being"? Like a god? Doesn't have to be a god. Otherwise, where's the reward? My bad, my bad. You're surprisingly easy to talk to. I ran my mouth and said some nonsensical things. It's weird that you have no friends when you're this easy to talk to. Why don't you make any? If I had friends, they'd lower my strength as a human. What? Sorry, I don't understand. Well, uh, how do I put this... If I had friends, I'd have to worry about them. If they got hurt, I'd be hurt too. If they felt sad, I'd feel sad too. In a sense, they become your weak points. Friends make humans weak. But if your friends have fun, you'd have fun too. If they're happy, you'd be happy too. They don't necessarily make you weaker. Wrong. If my friends have fun, I'd be jealous. If they're happy, I'd be envious. You're so petty. Gimme a break. Naoetsu Private High School Entrance I guess... I'll head over to the library now. Wanna join me, Araragi-kun? Why? What would we do there? We'd study, of course. "Of course"? Why would I study during spring break, when we don't even have any homework? Our college entrance exams are next year, though. Naoetsu Private High School Entrance Entrance exams aside, at this rate, I might not even graduate. I'm already a lost cause. Hm... Araragi-kun, do you have a cell phone? Yeah, I do. Hand it over. Thanks, here you go. Naoetsu Private High School Entrance I added my number and email. Hanekawa Tsubasa Too bad! You just made a friend. What's up with her? Naoetsu Private High School Entrance Flashback Flashback Flashback Flashback Flashback Oh yeah~ Hanekawa Tsubasa 4.

Dost thou not hear me? I declare that thou art hereby permitted to help me. H- Hey... Are you all right? I- I'm calling an ambulance! An ambulance? That's unnecessary. Instead, offer me thy blood. Do you believe in vampires? They say she's a beautiful blonde woman with eyes so cold, they send chills down your spine. I am Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade... the iron-blooded, hot-blooded, cold-blooded vampire. I shall consume thy blood as my flesh. Therefore, offer me thy blood. Aren't vampires... supposed to be immortal? I've lost too much blood. I can no longer regenerate, nor transform. I am at death's door. Worthless human, 'tis a privilege to become my flesh and blood. "B-Blood"? Can't you just get a transfusion? H- How much do you need? For the time being, thine body's worth shall suffice. I see, my body's worth... What's the matter? Blood! Offer me thy blood! Quickly! At once! At once, thou languid oaf! It's okay. I can run away. Can thou imagine a greater honor?! I can escape. Run away. Only by doing so, can I deny this reality. Hey! S- Surely thou jest. Will thou... not help me? Ah...! No...! No, no, no, no! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! Help me! Help me, please! I- I beseech thee! Help me... No! No...! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'll die. Besides, she's a monster! A vampire! I don't need to help her... right? Of course I know that! Don't give up, stupid! M- May I? Why else would I be here, you fool? Dammit. Dammit. Dammit. How? How did it come to this? I swear I'll be a better person in my next life. I'll be wiser, able to blame my misfortune on others. I'll be reborn as someone like that. That's why... I'll help you. Take my blood. Take it all. Every last drop. Suck me dry! Thank you. 5. Cram School A dream? Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Shock Huh...?! H- Hey! W- Wake up. Five more minutes. Five minutes I- I told you to wake up! Don't feel like it. Feel How long you gonna sleep for?! - 4.6 billion years - 4.6 billion years or so. Another Earth will form! March 28th It's been two days? Fool! Goodness. How brainless must thou be to go out under the sun? The average vampire would have evaporated instantly. Never venture outdoors whilst the sun is up. Now that thou art immortal, thou would burn and regenerate, burn and regenerate, in an endless cycle. Such is the woe of being an immortal vampire. Vam... pire? No-No way, are you...? Flashback Flashback Flashback 'Tis I, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade. Call me Heart-Under-Blade. 400 years have passed since I last made a minion. Thou art my second. And, considering thy regenerative prowess, thou turned out well. M- Minion? Minion Indeed! Thus, thou- Which reminds me, I've yet to learn thy name. No matter. The name thou once bore is meaningless hereafter. Anyways, servant... Welcome to the world of the night. Whe- Where are we? I believe this was once a "cram school." 'Twas closed and abandoned several years ago. Now, 'tis quite the convenient hiding place. Huh... Okay, Kiss-Shot, next question- Halt! I told thee to call me Heart-Under-Blade! That's too long. "Kiss-Shot" is nice and short. Or can I not call you that? Well... If that's what thou prefers, then so be it. I've no reason to refuse. So? What is thy next question? Um... I became a vampire, right? Obviously. Must I spell it out for thee? Thou became my minion, my servant. Consider it an honor. Your "servant"? Then, why do you have the body of a child now? When we first met, you were more... grown-up. Excuse me for being childish! That's not what I meant... Grown-up, plus... your limbs were severed. I drank all of thy blood, yet 'twas still insufficient. Thus, I had to assume this form. 'Tis better than dying. That said, I am barely immortal and my vampiric powers are greatly limited. Inconvenient indeed. Flashback Flashback Flashback As thou can see, my limbs regenerated at least in shape. Though they are devoid of power... This shall suffice for now. However, do well not to forget thine place, servant. I may appear this way now, but I am a vampire who has lived for 500 years. As but a newborn vampire, thou must never address me as an equal. O- Oh. What an ambiguous reply. Dost thou truly understand? I think so... Then as a display of fealty, pat my head. That's enough. Why did you turn me into a vampire? Hm? I was prepared to die after being sucked dry by you. No particular reason. Those bitten by vampires will, without exception, become vampires. That is all. Is that so? Actually, this is more convenient for me. For there is something I need thee to do. Thy blood alone only let me regenerate this much. I am far from my full power. So for the time being, thou shall act in my stead. And do what? Can I... Can I... become human again? Hmph. As I thought. I knew that question would come. So? Can I?! Thou can. I guarantee it. I swear upon my name. 6. Vampire Hunters The names of the three who robbed Kiss-Shot of her body parts Those three are vampire-slaying specialists. They're the ones who slayed you? Don't be foolish. They've yet to kill me. However, they did manage to steal my limbs. Since I've not much regenerative power left, I cannot fight in this state. Thus... Thou shall confront those three, and retrieve my limbs. What? You make it sound so easy... To make thou human again, I must be at full power. In other words, I must be complete. My limbs are absolutely necessary for that end. B- But... I suck at fighting. Worst case scenario, won't I be slain? Fool, thou speak as if thou were still human. Thou art now my minion. Now that I am severely weakened, thou could easily kill even me, a top-ranked vampire. Oh, you're pretty weak for a vampire? Balderdash! True, I may be stronger than you in your weakened state... But those three fought you in your full-powered state, and still took your limbs. In that case- I was merely caught off guard by their teamwork. I underestimated them. Hm... Which means, so long as thou fights them one by one, they don't stand a chance. To be clear, 'tis a simple task. Wh-What should I do? Sever Ca-Can't we talk this out?! Sever I- I'm a human! A- Are you gonna murder a human?! Mur der Rotation Haha! You're all so energetic. Did something good happen? 7. Oshino Wha- Thanks, you saved me. No need to thank me. You saved yourself, Araragi-kun. Naoetsu Private High School Namishiro Park North Shirahebi Shrine Don't be so on edge. That's one intense glare. You seem energetic. Did something good happen? Anyways, let's go home, Araragi-kun. "Go home"? To the abandoned cram school. Eh? Hold up! H- How do you know about that place? Huh? Of course I know. I'm the one who led her there, after all. "Courage is doing what you know is right," they say. That Heart-Under-Blade girl was struggling to drag your body around, so I showed her to a nice place. What exactly are you? Just some old man who's passing by. Relax. I'm no vampire-slaying specialist. My specialty is broader and more extensive. I'll give a proper self-introduction later. Ah! Thou art back! Who is that behind thee? Seems familiar. That's cold. You don't remember me? So? How'd it go? Thou failed... Those three are still cooperating? By working together, didn't they beat you at full power? If so, there's no way I can win against them. Then face them one-on-one! I can't. They're inseparable. You said it'd be fine to lay low here, but it won't be long before they find- Don't worry about that. While you two were sleeping, I quietly erected a boundary around here. Boundary? Like, a barrier? Yep, close enough. Hey man, what's your aim here? Why are you helping Kiss-Shot and me? I realize you're not our foe, but I doubt you're our friend. What a cruel thing to say. Listen, I'm here to maintain balance. You could say that it's my job to bridge this side and that side. Introduce yourself. You said you would. Rotation Three Two Oshino Meme. Oshino Meme A free-spirited vagabond. You can think of me as an authority on yokai. Haha! But unlike those three, I'm not that great at yokai-slaying. "Not that great"? Let me rephrase that. I'm not a fan of it. Isn't that your specialty? I specialize in maintaining balance, conducting negotiations from neutral ground. I guess you could call me a negotiator. Negotiate? To bridge this side and that side? Where are "this side" and "that side"? Speech／Voice If "this side" is humans, is "that side" monsters? At the moment, which side am I on? Monsters? How quaint. I call 'em "oddities." Oddity And that girl's hailed as the Oddity Slayer. She's a rare breed of vampire that can drain the energy of oddities. As a matter of fact, that's why she's famous. I eavesdropped on your little chat earlier. You seem to be in quite the pickle. I didn't expect things to get so problematic. We've no problems. 'Tis a simple task. In the eyes of an undying vampire, maybe. But it's quite troublesome for us humans. Right, Araragi-kun? You've also piqued my interest, Heart-Under-Blade. You promised to turn Araragi-kun, your minion, back into a human... or so I heard. Hmph. If you'd like, I can negotiate with 'em. "Ne-Negotiate with 'em"? Like, with those three? Who else? You-You're gonna help us out? Nope. I'll just lend a hand. After all, the balance feels kinda off at the moment. It pains me to watch you get bullied. Of course, since it's my job, it'll cost ya. Let's see... How 'bout two million? T- Two mil?! Akasegawa I won't ever bother you to pay up. That's the least I can charge for maintaining balance. B- But... Let us hear thy specific plan. Negotiations will not be easy. Those three cannot be reasoned with. All I can do is bow down and ask nicely. And sincerely. If that doesn't work, I'll resort to more dangerous measures. But if they're willing to talk, then the game is afoot. Game, thou say? First, we gotta split 'em up. Dealing with them one by one should be easy. Heart-Under-Blade, aren't you of that opinion? Then let's make it happen. Not so fast, brat. How will thou negotiate with those three? The details are a trade secret, but... I'll set up the battlefield. Next, Araragi will retrieve your limbs from them. Once you regain your limbs, your power will be restored. Then, Araragi-kun can safely become human again. Hey, servant! I do not possess human currency. I've no concept of how heavy a debt two million is. Can I rely on thou to shoulder it? Worry not. This brat's skills are genuine. Weak as I may be, I know that much is true. I don't have much saved up... But if I can pay whenever, hassle-free, and I don't need a guarantor or collateral... I'll shoulder it. It's a deal! Haha! Thank you, come again. Just kidding. 8. ED Credits 9. Preview Voice-only - Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade - Voice-only - An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth...
