SIMCHA: 200 miles from nowhere, looking for Atlantis. With James Cameron on board, it seemed anything was possible. JAMES: Pick it apart, let's be rigorous. SIMCHA: Now all I have to do is find the city that most people say never existed. Too many dead ends, must find a way to connect the dots. HEYWORTH: That looks like a boat and if that's the hull of a boat, that boat's underwater. FREUND: In criminal investigations, you follow the money. In archaeology, you follow the stones. SIMCHA: The crazy thing is, it's the same scene over, and over, and over again. I think I'm on to something big. -All right, here we go, and action. I've always been fascinated by the future. Can you step back a half step, but I've also loved imagining past worlds, and what the people were like. -Ahh! -Okay, move forward slowly. Look in the second window just a little bit as you go by. When I was in high school, I was fascinated by ancient Egypt, by the Greeks, by the Romans, and Atlantis and I think that underneath this myth, this parable, there has to be something historically that happened, and cut. SIMCHA: Hi. -So. -How you doing, it's good to see you, just awesome. -This is my day job. -It's a good day job. -So, are we doing this? -We're doing it, going after Atlantis. I've got the boat, I've got, I've got the divers, the ROV, the team. -Oh man, I gotta be there on that ship. I've never, not been on a ship. -I know you do, I know you do. -It's killing me. -So I know you, I don't want. Pull you off, and we need to strategize, so. -Yeah, hey Maria, let's go to lunch? MARIA: Okay, all right guys, let's take lunch (inaudible). -Let's get some maps. SIMCHA: Everything we know about this highly debated topic comes from the Greek philosopher Plato who wrote some 2,400 years ago. In Plato's tale, the Atlanteans ruled an aggressive empire stretching from the Atlantic all the way to the eastern Mediterranean. Their capital, Atlantis, was a port, a unique city made up of three concentric rings of land and water. At its center, there was a temple to the god of water, Poseidon, where the Atlanteans sacrificed bulls. There were also incredible bridges and canals connecting the various moats and a central, wide canal that cut across the city and linked the temple with the sea and it all came to a terrible end, in a single day and night, when earthquakes and tsunamis destroyed the city, submerging it beneath water and mud, but where is it? -All right so, where are we going to go first? -A picture of a journey. -Here's, here's Plato, right? In Athens and he's talking about a civilization that, in his words, spanned the whole region. So it's a sea going civilization. -And they come from somewhere over here, from the western Mediterranean. -Right, right, so they could be anywhere. -So what's my mission? -Investigate some new hypotheses, investigate the ones that people tend to find appealing, pick it apart. Let's be rigorous. -I'm looking for the signs of a common civilization that dominated the Mediterranean all the way to the Atlantic and maybe this quest will lead to the legendary Mother City, Atlantis. Quite a journey. -Well you're going to be, you're going to spend a lot of time on boats. -You're the, you're the boat guy. I get sea sick. -Look you could, you could fly but I think if you go on a boat, you'll think the way they thought back then, and the distances will mean something to you, and you'll understand what it's like to be part of a trading culture. -First stop? -Well, look, I'm very partial to the Minoans, as you know. The Minoans were definitely a sea-going civilization, one of the peak civilizations of its day. On Crete and on Thira, 1,100 years before Plato, you've got a city and it disappeared over night. -Santorini. -Yeah, Santorini. Absolutely, and, and, uh, why don't we get Charlie into this? You know, I mean he wrote, he wrote the book on Atlantis. -Charlie. -Charlie. Get Charlie, yeah. SIMCHA: So a few days later, and with the help of a few seasickness pills, I set sail along the Eastern Mediterranean for the Greek island of Santorini. ♪ ♪ 3,500 years ago this island looked much different than today. It had a round shape with an opening leading into the sea, very similar to Plato's description of Atlantis. At that time, Santorini was inhabited by the great Minoan civilization, but everything changed in 1550 BC when the volcano in the center of the island erupted with devastating force. (explosion). So is Plato describing Santorini, when he writes of Atlantis? To answer this, I meet with author, Charles Pellegrino. CHARLES: Nah, this probably happened post eruption. SIMCHA: Using drones, Pellegrino's conducting a survey of ash layers in the mouth of the volcano, in which he's sailing. -Can we come in closer to the original grand layer? SIMCHA: Recreating the events that led to the volcano's collapse. -Behind, is one of the largest volcanic calderas in the world. What existed on this island before the eruption was a mountain that was up to about a mile high, it's all gone. In the experience of human history, this would have been the largest volcanic explosion, we're talking about a force that would add up to more than a million atomic bombs detonating right behind me. (explosion). SIMCHA: The eruption went on for days. A mass of rock, almost equivalent to Mount Everest, was blown into the atmosphere. The sky was darkened for days and vast areas of the planet experienced winter, which lasted two whole years. The eruption and the earthquakes that accompanied it created a mega tsunami, which reached a height of 800 feet and devastated the coasts of Crete, Egypt and Turkey. At the north coast of Crete, the tsunami destroyed Minoan coastal towns and obliterated their massive fleet. The cloud of ash that spread from the explosion was so hot that people who stood on the shores of Crete disintegrated as the cloud hit them. Egyptian writings from that time describe a huge shockwave that destroyed houses, temples and parts of the pyramids. -This event was so huge that there is no way that the civilizations of the time, especially in the Mediterranean, would have failed to notice it and mention it in their oral and written history. SIMCHA: So was the eruption of Santorini the cataclysmic event in Plato's story? Are the Minoans the long lost Atlanteans? I travel with Charlie to the only Minoan archaeological site still standing on the Island, the Minoan city of Akrotiri. It seems to match Plato's description of a very advanced Bronze Age civilization. I'm amazed that we're walking next to buildings that are three-story high. -Yes. -And what, what, 35, 3,600 years old? -Yes. -The streets are not that narrow, you've got openness, open windows. I can see people's homes, they're more or less the same so, it's an egalitarian society. -These buildings are built with a certain degree of earthquake resistance in mind. In fact, you can see. -Wait, wait, wait a minute. You're saying that these people are building earthquake resistant buildings? -Very similar to some of the designs that we're developing in Japan and in the United States. -Today? -During the 20th century -Oh my God! -As amazing as these multi-story buildings are, it's what's underneath them. -What do you mean? -Toilets, the plumbing that runs through these buildings is of a sort that we didn't start seeing again, briefly during the Roman period, but in our own time, not until 200, 300 years ago. If, for example, at the time of the American Revolution in Philadelphia, even at the palace in Paris, uh, these toilets were the stairwells and the streets themselves, you could smell Paris or Philadelphia from two miles away. -And here, 3,600 years ago, these people have amazing architecture, high technology, flush toilets, 3,600 years ago! We have aqueducts, hygiene, open society, egalitarian, and it's all destroyed overnight. -Yes, yes. -Is this Atlantis? -I would say to a 99% probability that this is a part of what Plato was writing about in his story of Atlantis. SIMCHA: So the Minoans were a highly advanced civilization that vanished due to a natural disaster, but is this enough to say that they were the Atlanteans? I'm not sure so I check in with the boss. JAMES (through computer): Simcha, hey, so why are you calling me? You miss me already or did something go wrong? Did you sink the boat? -Nothing, nothing went wrong, no boat sinking. Uh, I did spent some time with Charlie on Santorini, and I wanted to report back because, you know, in many ways it's very convincing. It's a high technology. It was destroyed pretty much overnight, but Plato says they came from the West and they were aggressive, and the Minoans were in the East, and they were actually peaceful, and the other thing that really bothers me, even though I think that, uh, Santorini is part of the story, Plato never describes a volcanic eruption. It's more like he's describing tsunamis, and earthquake, and sinking, and mud. JAMES (through computer): This gets to the kind of the fundamental question of our quest here, which is, is there really one place? Because you know how I feel about this. I feel it's a science fiction story. I, I feel that it's a parable, it's a moral and ethical parable, and he's drawing from different things and their collective record. He's piecing it together, you know. As a science fiction writer, you call it world building. SIMCHA: I differ. I don't question that Plato wanted to use it for some purpose, but I do believe that he's not just cobbling different pieces. He talks about a civilization, and there must be a point of origin. I do believe there's an Atlantis out there somewhere. JAMES (through computer): All right, well look, let's go find it. -There's Malta out there. There's Sardinia. I want to keep going West. JAMES (through computer): Yeah, so go West, young man. SIMCHA: I now sail West from Santorini to the next prime candidate for Atlantis, the island of Malta. Like many others, Peter, our Maltese boat captain, believes that his homeland is Atlantis. He shares his theory with my team. We're investigating the possibility that Malta's Atlantis. Now that's only possible if Malta was a lot bigger. PETER: Well, Malta was definitely much larger in the not so distant past. If we take this table as an example, if we took Malta and put Malta there, and we extended Malta by bringing up that flap on that table, it gives you an idea of how large this land may have been. SIMCHA: What's the evidence? -If you look around the Maltese Islands, there are areas where you can actually see the bottom. You've got a ridge here across which is really shallow with depths of as little as nine meters. -In your mind there's no question that this shallow area was once above water? -Definitely, something cataclysmic must have happened in the past. SIMCHA: Suddenly, incredible. I got, I got to take a picture for my kids. Oh this is magical. They're leading us to Atlantis. We dock in Gozo, one of the five islands that make up Malta. Right away, Peter takes me to the cliffs. He wants to show me more evidence that Malta was once a much bigger island. He starts with mysterious tracks called cart ruts that criss-cross the entire island. These are very impressive. Tell me about what we're looking at here. -Well, as you can see these are clearly man-made ruts, which were hewed out of the rocks. They put large stones, round stones, very good stones in the ruts. SIMCHA: Like right here. -That's right. Then, they would put the large boulders on top of the spheres and push, pull these huge stones to build their temples. SIMCHA: I got to tell you this is very impressive. When I heard about ruts, I thought we're dealing with some scratches in the stone, but you see the depth of that thing as you go towards the cliff, and clearly they must've served some function. It's strong evidence that there was something there. -It's probable that, uh, there was a large civilization that lived on a larger island at the time. SIMCHA: 6,000 years ago, the cart ruts seem to have been used to build megalithic structures. DAPHNE: The oldest part of this building dates to 2600 BC, which makes it one of the oldest man-made freestanding structures in the world. We think that the main function of these sites was sacred. SIMCHA: The advanced architecture on an island that has been partially submerged, fits with Plato's description of Atlantis. I now go to what seems to be an even older structure to learn about the people who built these stone age temples. It's amazing to me that they built all this, without the wheel, without any, uh, metal tools, without cement. -We do have remains here and there of rounded stones, which could have been used to transport some of the megaliths. -They're living here for a 1,000 years. They're building these amazing structures. What happened to them? -We know that the culture stopped suddenly in around 2500 BC. -Have you found weapons here? -No, there is no indication of any weapons at all and there is really no indication of any violence. SIMCHA: The high technology and the sudden disappearance fits the story of Atlantis but the Maltese were peaceful and the Atlanteans were war-like. So, I decide to keep heading West. According to Plato, Atlantis is buried beneath water and mud at the western end of the Mediterranean, just past the pillars of Hercules, todays Strait of Gibraltar and that's exactly where Professor Richard Freund has brought a team of divers and marine archaeologists in his years-long quest for Atlantis. -This is the absolute most sophisticated search for Atlantis. DIVER (over radio): Oh my God look at this. SIMCHA: As I sail west from Malta, Professor Richard Freund is exploring an area just past the Strait of Gibraltar. -There's three rules to archaeology: location, location, location. If you're looking for a place that has specific coordinates, either in literature or in inscriptions, you go to that place. SIMCHA: After years of research, he believes that the search for Atlantis begins beneath these waters. COASTGUARD: Atlantic Explorer, do you read me. JOSE: Yes, go ahead, over. SIMCHA: To find the lost city, he's gathered some of the best divers and marine archaeologists in the world. BILL: I have no doubt that there are vast areas that were once inhabited by people that are now hundreds of feet underwater. -The evidence is really what people want to hear about. They don't want to hear about the theories, they don't want to hear about just geophysics, they want to hear that there is evidence and they want to know what that evidence is. Plato is writing in a very specific time period, so when he says that Atlantis was located at the Strait of Gibraltar, he called them the Pillars of Hercules in his time, every single mariner, every single Greek reader, every single person knew exactly where he was talking about. We're right in front of the Strait of Gibraltar, the Pillars of Hercules. You have to look right here. SIMCHA: In order to identify promising locations, Freund and his team deploy a special underwater radar and a highly advanced multi-beam eco sounder that produces detailed 3D images of objects on the ocean floor. -So what are we hoping to find? From my view, the smoking gun, would be, ancient, massive architecture. We're not gonna find the Disney-esque version of Atlantis, that it sunk and everything is intact, and the statues are standing, and the columns are standing, and the walls are perfect. What we're going to find is, pieces, but we're going to find lots of pieces. It's what I call the debris splatter. Debris splatter means, whenever there is a destruction, the destruction is always going to leave evidence splattered over a large area. Atlantis was supposed to be a very large city. Anything that is still left from the debris is going to end up in the Atlantic in this area. SIMCHA: On the command bridge, the crew monitor the screens. They're looking for anything unusual bulging from the sea floor. JOSE: Here's what we'll do, we'll go there and then turn that way. SIMCHA: The process is painstaking. Sometimes hours go by without seeing anything out of the ordinary. -Oh. -Okay guys. JOSE: There we go. There we go. We started seeing like a mountain. Can be a rock, anything. Around 4 meters of height, 56 meters wide. So it probably means that there is something down there. EDOARDO (over radio): I can't see anything. Visibility really bad. DIVER (over radio): Slow down. RICHARD (over radio): We're following the shot line down. DIVER (over radio): Clearing up. SIMCHA: The divers are now more than 150 feet deep. DIVER (over radio): What's that in there? Can you see that? ♪ ♪ SIMCHA: It's a shipwreck, but, it's not ancient. It's made of iron and it's relatively modern. They keep looking around, but it's soon clear that, at this site, they will not find what they're looking for. While the search continues off the coast of Southern Spain, I'm nearing Sicily. Freund is right. Plato places Atlantis west of The Pillars of Hercules, and most scholars are convinced that he's talking about the Strait of Gibraltar, but some historians believe that Plato is referring to the Strait of Messina, between the Italian peninsula and the island of Sicily. We're sailing right through the Strait of Messina right now. Sunrise, it's gorgeous, and you can really see how close the two landmasses really are. Italy is right over there and right across, there is Sicily. So, it's entirely conceivable that at one point, these were regarded as the Pillars of Hercules, there might have been physically some pillars put up as you sailed out into the Mediterranean. So, I can totally imagine that as seafaring got better and they pushed out, the Pillars of Hercules moved from here, their original position to Gibraltar facing the Atlantic. So if the Strait of Messina is the original Pillars of Hercules, can it be that Sardinia, on the other side of the strait, was once Atlantis? 3,500 years ago, one of the most impressive civilizations of ancient times thrived on Sardinia. So I'm headed to one of the 7,000 sites that this forgotten culture left on the island. I meet with American researcher Robert Ishoy who has been studying Sardinia for decades. Ishoy believes that these spectacular ruins called Nuraghe are what's left of Atlantis. This, Robert, is impressive to be sure. ROBERT: Yes. SIMCHA: But is it Atlantis? -This culture here on Sardinia matches everything Plato describes about Atlantis. He talked about the culture, as being a very advanced culture. Look at the architecture this is very advanced technique. SIMCHA: It is amazing, I actually can't believe it. You know, we're inside a 3,500-year-old structure, built with no cement and it's still standing. -The circular aspects of the buildings, Plato said everything was rounded, they built pillars, he calls them pillars. SIMCHA: But these round structures, were they for living in temples, what were they for? -The original story was that Poseidon, of course which is a god, married a woman and in order to protect her, he built a pillar. -A tower, like this one. -Yeah, exactly. SIMCHA: But what about the rest of Plato's descriptions? Does the Island of Sardinia match what we know about Atlantis? To find out, we travel to the southern end of the island. -Well here we are at Nora. This is a very significant place on Sardinia. Plato specifically said that Atlantis was destroyed by earthquakes and flooding. Sardinia is a place that has frequent flooding and in the ocean, just south of Sardinia is a major fault, so here at Nora there's evidence of destruction from earthquakes and flooding, and there are ruins both on the land, but also below the sea. So, this is a very special place and it gives strong evidence that there's a connection between Sardinia and what Plato said about the destruction of Atlantis. SIMCHA: Sardinia also has two other important characteristics that match Plato's descriptions: the rocks around the island have three colors, black, white and red, and there are hot and cold springs everywhere. Robert has me wondering, are these the temples of Atlantis? He believes that they are and he takes me to one of the most impressive, Su Nuraxi, wow. -We're in the largest complex that they have found to date. This is a complex of five towers. You have the center tower and then you have the four outer towers that match the compass north, south, east and west. -And until recently, very recently, nobody knew it was here. -Well it was covered with mud, completely. Imagine the height of this and completely buried by mud. -I can almost imagine the people coming out of these corridors. What are they like? -We have found figurines of warriors here, and you can, uh, tell by the fact that this place is so enclosed and protected, more than likely, this was the upper class and the warrior class. SIMCHA: But if this is Atlantis, where's the fabled temple to Poseidon? Look, right there. -We have got to go there. SIMCHA: To our amazement, Plato provides the co-ordinates. SIMCHA: To my surprise, Sardinia's geography, geology and archaeology seem to match Plato's descriptions of Atlantis. Oh my God, if ever there was an Atlantean house this is it, I mean this is what Plato describes, I don't know if it's Atlantis but it's certainly architecture that matches the architecture that Plato describes in Atlantis, amazing. So I decide to investigate one more aspect of the story. Plato describes a mountain in the middle of the island that stands in the center of a beautiful plain. On top of it, he says that Poseidon built the very first structure on Atlantis. Is there anything like this on Sardinia? -Okay, this is the Campidano Plain right here. -Okay is there a mountain? -Yeah, look, look right there. Right there. -There's a Nuraghe, a tower. -On top of the mountain. (laughs). Santa Vittoria. -Let's check it out. -We have got to go there. -This is crazy. -Yeah, it is. SIMCHA: It's located in what used to be, in ancient times, the middle of the island, before the southern part was covered by the sea. We go there and discover a perfect fit with Plato. I can't believe it, we used Plato as a treasure map. It said, "You'll find a little mountain, you'll find a beautiful view, a fertile valley, a plain, ancient ruins." -Well, not only did we find ruins but we found ruins that are more likely the earliest if not the very first tower that was built. SIMCHA: Next to it, there's a temple dedicated to a water deity, maybe Poseidon. In ancient times, it was surrounded by a moat. So, what, what are we saying here? What are you saying here? This is Atlantis? -I'm saying that if you take the description given by Plato of all the different things about Atlantis, the geography, the island itself, the civilization, there is no other place on this Earth that fits it better than Sardinia. SIMCHA: I'm beginning to think that Robert might be right. JAMES (over computer): Hey, Simcha, what's happening? SIMCHA: What's happening is I think I found it. I know this sounds crazy but Sardinia, I think Sardinia is Atlantis. JAMES (over computer): Okay, let's hear the case. SIMCHA: You know, it fits exactly like Plato describes. The technology is amazing, and you find that circular motif everywhere in Sardinia. In the center of the island, sure enough, you have a temple to a water deity that sure looks and smells and sounds like Poseidon, and it's a war-like people. JAMES (over computer): All right, so, so you're ticking some boxes but I'm not convinced that just because these buildings are round that that necessarily translates to the kind of concentric city plan and as I understand it, that concentric city plan actually incorporated a harbor, and the grand Nuraghe that you explored is much more inland. It's very far from the coast. SIMCHA: Yes, but all that very beautiful farmland today was once underwater so I could imagine in the special effects in my mind that, that it was surrounded by water, at least the temple of Poseidon. JAMES (over computer): But in any case, the timing doesn't really add up because the Nuraghic civilization emerged after the eruption. SIMCHA: You're right. That doesn't fit because it actually, Santorini doesn't destroy Sardinian culture. It almost gives rise to it. JAMES (over computer): So maybe these were displaced people that were refugees. SIMCHA: Could it be that what we're seeing in Sardinia is a, a new Atlantis? JAMES (over computer): Yeah, I can imagine that. So you need to be looking for Nuraghes or similar architectural motifs in other places. SIMCHA: Still further west. JAMES (over computer): Keep going west! SIMCHA: Jim says go west. There's only one candidate left. Past the Strait of Gibraltar, Southern Spain where there are others who think that there could have been Atlantean refugees. Author Georgeos Diaz-Montexano has been researching this area for years and he's convinced that some Atlantean refugees fled inland and built shrines to memorialize their lost city. Deciphering the shrines would help Georgeos prove his theory. GEORGEOS: You can see around three inscribed boats here. With about eight to twelve oars each. SIMCHA: According to Georgeos, the epic of Atlantis is recorded in a series of Stone Age petroglyphs, images inscribed in stone, telling the story of a drowned city, a legendary port, and ships that once sailed the Atlantic. -I think that we shoot here. KEN: But see, that's gonna mean the camera's gonna be. -It's gonna be up there. SIMCHA: To test his theory, Georgeos enlists the help of Engineer Ken Boydston and Professor Gregory Heyworth, experts in forensic photography and spectral imaging, bringing lost images back to life. GEORGEOS: People who think Atlantis research isn't serious. Haven't looked at the matter seriously. I believe in an honest search for truth. Let the facts fall where they may. -Ready, shoot. -Shooting. -I'm using the strobe as a raking light, which will bring out the shadows and the depth of the incisions in the rock. -Oh, yeah, this is a horse with a long flowing mane. -Shoot. -Shooting. -I'm looking closely at the screen and I like what I'm seeing. I can the hoof much more clearly. I'm looking for signs of a horseshoe, which has a lip at the end and I see no signs of a horseshoe at all, which means it's pre-Roman. -That would be pre-Roman. Oh, oh, here we go. Okay, yeah, yeah. There's a bunch of stuff here. SIMCHA: The investigators see wide moat-like circles that surround the entire scene. -I see a bunch of concentric circles and in the middle of this, there's some roughly parallel straight lines. SIMCHA: Concentric, moat-like circles are exactly what Plato reports when describing Atlantis. -What's that line right above the horse? -Well, that's a long wavy line, and actually there's a couple of them. There's one there, one, a further one up. Could they be mountains, could they be waves, could be water. Horse could be under water. -Could be. -Could be. SIMCHA: The horse is tilted downwards. If it's under water that could mean it's drowning and it seems that it's not the only figure beneath the apparent line of water. -That looks like a boat. That looks like a boat up in the right-hand corner. Zoom in a bit, Ken. -This one here looks like maybe the hull. That could be the hull of a boat. -Yeah, yeah. -And if that's the hull of the boat, that boat's underwater. SIMCHA: While the team continues their work, I join Georgeos in Badajoz, southern Spain. I've heard of his work and I'm anxious to see some mysterious finds in this little known museum. GEORGEOS: This is important. These bull warriors... Have horns sprouting from their heads, not from their helmets. SIMCHA: In Plato, bulls are associated to the religion of Atlantis. These inscriptions are incredible: warriors, chariots, and an un-deciphered script known as Tartessan. Can this be the lost language of Atlantis? Georgeos was saving the best for last. GEORGEOS: Look at this. SIMCHA: Oh my God. GEORGEOS: Three concentric circles and a canal that goes in and a dot in the center. Which symbolically may represent the temple of Poseidon! -So this is a symbol of Atlantis. -Atlantis. SIMCHA: These concentric circles remind me of the architecture I saw in Sardinia. Can it be that southern Spain was the mother country and these soldiers once stood guard at Atlantis? What you're saying is that we have the entire story, we have Plato here, carved in stone. The concentric circles, the canal that goes right through, the temple of Poseidon right over here, the warriors, because it was a war-like society that tried to dominate the Mediterranean. You have a high technology. Chariots are a high technology. When you put all this together, you're telling me the entire story is carved in stone here. What you're saying is that we have a bible of the Atlanteans. Georgeos now leads me to another site in the area. He thinks he's identified an Atlantean city. The cement squares are modern, the archaeology below is ancient. It's a massive Copper Age site and strangely, it has hardly been reported to the scientific community. It looks remarkably like Plato's Atlantis. I'm standing in Jaen, a 5,000-year-old city that was recently found. They discovered that it's one kilometer in diameter. 40,000 people lived here 5,000 years ago and the architecture, their architecture is remarkable. Concentric circles, canals, individual homes with a round architecture. The reason you haven't heard about it is because the developers got hold of it. They built on top of it and even where I'm standing is soon not going to be here. Jaen was a large city. 60,000 items were found here. By Copper Age standards, it had a huge population that lived here when Atlantis would have been at its height. I meet one of the archaeologists in charge of the site, Estella Perez. ESTELLA: The structure of the city starts from a zero point. And then a series of concentric circles were built from that zero point. With moats and linked walls, up to five. So the city grew from a central point in a circular shape. SIMCHA: So why did the inhabitants of ancient Jaen build these concentric moats of water and land in an arid area? Georgeos believes that Jaen is a sister city to Atlantis that was built with the same type of architecture in mind. I know looking at this rubble it may be very hard to imagine that this place should be as famous as the pyramids, so let me try to help you. Let's bring ancient Jaen back to life. ♪ ♪ SIMCHA: In the Strait of Gibraltar, Professor Freund and his divers continue their underwater search for Atlantis. ♪ ♪ (inaudible radio). -So a lot of sand, flat sand, featureless sand. No obvious rocks. No, not what we wanted, man. SIMCHA: As they relocate to a deeper site, Freund decides to bring out the heavy guns, the ROV. -What we're gonna do is take these cameras off and put this block on. MARYANN: I think we're ready to go. SIMCHA: The ROV is lightweight, but carries a big visual punch. It can go deeper than the divers and stays longer below. It carries four 4K cameras and transmits images to the surface. If Atlantis is in these waters, these cameras will find it. MIKE: Bridge control. MAN (over radio): Well, hi there, this is bridge. -Yeah, bridge, ROV's just tracking due north. I'm only a meter off the bottom and I can't really see anything. We just have to crawl along try to keep a constant heading. SIMCHA: They're deeper than the last dive in the same area where they were looking for the debris field. -So this is why searching takes so long. It can take days, weeks, months because you just kind of crawl along. There's not a lot of visibility until you, you find something. SIMCHA: Despite their efforts, the operators don't make any significant discovery. -The sea is very great, and you have to have patience. SIMCHA: Meanwhile, some 25 miles inland, Georgeos takes us to what he believes is a shrine built by Atlantean refugees. Images of ships and ports at this remote location would support his idea that at some point, the real Atlantis was transformed into myth. GEORGEOS: I believe that this is the most important cave. With rock art, discovered in the Iberian Peninsula. Perhaps in the whole of the West. Here you have a harbor scene with boats... That look as if they are entering and leaving. There are seven different boat designs. This is what made me think. Of that famous passage in Plato in which he states. That the port of Atlantis was very important. Because boats from all nations came there. SIMCHA: The spectral imaging experts cover the cave's entrance and begin their work. They use special cameras that utilize 16 different wavelengths of light invisible to the human eye so as to capture detailed images of the inscriptions. -Our job here is to try to make these very faint images as clear as possible, perhaps discovering new symbols, which are not even faintly visible to the naked eye. We're moving through the spectrum from violet up through infrared for a total of 26 shots. -I see the lines that we could barely see before. Oh, I see the boat, I see the oars. -There is some, yes. SIMCHA: With regular light waves visible to the human eye, the image of a boat in what appears to be a square harbor is faded and indistinct but when photographing with special multi-spectral light, new details suddenly emerge. -We're seeing something very interesting. It just occurred to me what this is. This is a three-dimensional image. We can see inside the boat, and these are the ribs of the keel itself that go down. The artist is sophisticated enough to actually show this in three dimensions. SIMCHA: New data becomes available on the other boat as well. -So what you can see from this picture is really interesting. We expected the oars, and those are oval and curved, but we didn't expect to see is that this what we thought might be another oar isn't. It's actually a rudder or starboard, and you can tell because look. See how it's squared off here? Yeah, it's very different from the oars, yeah, and it's coming out the back. This tells us a couple interesting things. First of all, because the rudder's over here, the boat is going in this direction, away from the harbor, which was over here. SIMCHA: Suddenly, they discover an image that was totally invisible to the naked eye. -When we were processing this area, something that came out that we didn't expect and this is what we saw. -Wow. -There is in fact another figure. This clearly looks more like a tail, and this is like ears. We can see that this much more like a horse and a rider, who has some kind perhaps even a helmet on it, which has a plume on top, a feather on top or some kind of ornament. SIMCHA: Next to the rider, is another square that the scientists identify as a port with concentric circles. It appears as though the rider is fleeing from the port. Whoever made these drawings high in the mountains was not recording boats, ports, and fleeing horsemen that were nearby. They were recounting stories of events that occurred somewhere along the coast far away from here. You've got me shaken up. I can tell you that. I'm beginning to think that Georgeos is right and this is how Atlantis was transformed into legend. We're now joined by Professor Freund. Having little luck finding an underwater debris field, he decides to takes us to a unique coastal location in southern Spain where he believes Atlantis once stood. -We're in the Doñana Park, one of the largest marshes in all of Europe. Hundreds of square kilometers of just marsh, but in Antiquity, this was an open bay, an open bay that ships could come in all the way up to Seville. In 11 locations we did carbon dating that goes down to 13 meters below the surface where there's an even layer of methane which would indicate that some catastrophic event happened suddenly that sealed all those organisms, all those living beings into one methane layer. 4,000 BCE, 6,000 years ago, there were people living here and then suddenly, they were not. SIMCHA: We drive for hours across the strange and unique landscape of Doñana, for hundreds of miles, it shifts between vegetation, beach, and sand. Geologically, it's clear that something extraordinary happened here. After several hours, we arrive at our destination. Professor Freund takes me to the spot he calls the archaeological smoking gun. ♪ ♪ It doesn't look like much, Richard. -You know sometimes big things come in small packages. -Yeah, it's, I've seen castles and I've seen temples, and now I'm seeing a hole in the ground. Tell me why you think this is significant. -This is the last vestiges of Atlantis. It is from the time period in which Atlantis, a massive stone city, existed. -You're telling me this rock, this stone, that's the treasure. -It's not indigenous to this place. It's very, very different than any of the other stones. It's not sand, it's not mud. When I look at this and I see all the marine debris that's actually embedded into the rock surface, you can see that this is a rock that was not part of this area, and because it is so high up, I mean, we still are in the midst of the swamp, we think that a massive tsunami brought this stone in thousands of years ago and deposited it here. In criminal investigations, you follow the money. In archaeology, you follow the stones. SIMCHA: Professor Freund is not the first academic to come to this area. In the 1920s, two legendary archaeologists, Bonsor and Schulten, claimed that Doñana was once home to another lost city, Tartessos. Like Atlantis, Tartessos was a harbor city located beyond the Pillars of Hercules, famous for its metals and ships. It too mysteriously disappeared from history. Could it be that what Plato called Atlantis, the Atlanteans called Tartessos? Georgeos presents us with a rare document, an ancient Egyptian map. GEORGEOS: Look here. This is one of the most ancient maps of Ptolemy. -This is a map of Ptolemy? GEORGEOS: Exactly. A Byzantine copy of Ptolemy's map. -So it's a Byzantine copy of a 2nd century map, 1,800 years old. GEORGEOS: Correct. SIMCHA: This map provides us with an ancient perspective on the Mediterranean, Strait of Gibraltar, the Atlantic, and the coast of southern Spain. -How did you find this map? GEORGEOS: It is kept in the British Museum. -Why are you showing us this? GEORGEOS: Look here. -Tartessos. GEORGEOS: Tartessos -But look, not only does it say Tartessos, but it places Tartessos in a very specific place, and it actually has a, an illumination, an illustration of what the city looked like and how it's facing the water. GEORGEOS: With a symbol of a fortified city. In the same spot where we are right now, exactly. Exactly here. -Right here where we are, I mean, that's a. -This is crazy. Has anybody noticed this before? GEORGEOS: Nobody but me. -It's right there. -Yeah. -Been hiding in plain sight. -Yeah. -We can, we can go right there, look beneath the water. Now that we've identified a new target area to dive, will we find the lost city at last? DIVER (over radio): Whoa, oh, this is something. SIMCHA: With our new coordinates in hand. How's it going, guys? On the Atlantic Explorer just off the coast of Doñana, we're looking for evidence of a debris field attesting to the destruction of Atlantis. -I'm hoping. -We're in the right place. -We're in the right place. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ SIMCHA: Today, the visibility is very good, but there seems to be nothing down there. Time after time, the divers come back empty. DR. PEDERSEN: No fish, no wave, not even a beer can. I mean, it's just barren. SIMCHA: The day's nearing its end. After spending hours under water, the divers are exhausted. They decide to pack up their gear. -I think we need to increase the area where we are searching and I hope tomorrow's gonna be a better day. SIMCHA: Ever the optimist, Professor Freund doesn't get discouraged. -So today was not a good day, but that doesn't mean that tomorrow there won't be a major discovery. SIMCHA: As the ship steers back to port, something peculiar pops up on the screens. It looks circular and man-made. We have a hard choice to make. Even though the divers are very experienced, Professor Freund is concerned that they're too tired to make another descent, but Eduardo and his diving team are worried that by tomorrow, the weather won't cooperate. They decide to go for it. ♪ ♪ DIVER (over radio): Oh, my God, take a look at those giant discs. DIVER (over radio): These discs must be man-made, there's no question about it. DIVER (over radio): Ancient for sure, but what are they? DIVER (over radio): I have no idea, mate. SIMCHA: Professor Freund believes that these circular discs are part of the debris field that he's been looking for. He thinks that these are the sectional remains of columns. Dr. Ralph Pedersen, the marine archaeologist on board believes that they're looking at millstones, which may date to the Roman Age, much later than any possible Atlantis. It all depends on what's in the center of the discs. Are the holes square as in columns or round as in millstones? -Now the thing is with column drums, they're generally thicker and they would cut a square in the bottom of it, put in a wooden tenant, okay, and then mount the other one on top of that and that's how they would build their columns. The reason why is they were square is so that they wouldn't rotate over time. -Rotate, but the question is, is that a round hole or is that a square hole? -It might be square, it might not. -They're almost one on top of the other. -The fact that these are one on top of each other doesn't necessarily mean it's architectural. I mean, it could be a ship's cargo. When you put things on a ship you're stacking them up, particularly if they're flat, and as a ship settles to the bottom, you're gonna have still things remaining in their stacked positions. -This doesn't look round at all. This looks like it's a square. -Maybe. I'll give you a maybe on that one. SIMCHA: For the divers, maybe is good enough. After days of coming up empty, they finally have found ancient objects that once maybe adorned Atlantis. -They were much bigger than, than what I anticipated. About a meter and half across maybe. Really solid, sort of like this thickness. It's definitely not modern times, you know, you can say that for sure. In the true sense of exploration, we had a, we had a find, and it was completely, completely by chance. SIMCHA: Georgeos agrees with Freund that what they found are columns. He believes that they once adorned a temple. The stones remind him of underwater video footage filmed nearby that has been in his possession for years. It's very not clear. JUAN: It's not clear. It's an old video, but if you focus on it. SIMCHA: Oh, wow, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This looks like a huge structure over here. JUAN: Yeah, sure. -Are these steps? SIMCHA: Oh, my God, this is very good, this is a staircase. -It's clear that this not natural. This is something that was man-made. SIMCHA: Who shot this? GEORGEOS: This video was shot by Francisco Salazar in 1993. He was a master diver and was known as "El Pantera". -This guy was a legend here? GEORGEOS: A legend. One of the most important master divers in Cadiz. -He, he, he, he's, is he alive? -No, he's not alive. GEORGEOS: He died in 1998. SIMCHA: It's very bad quality but it's very clear. It looks like a bunch of broken huge stones from a megalithic structure. JUAN: And you have a wall just in front of it. SIMCHA: A wall and it looks like a, this is crazy, a wall. -A circular wall. Yeah, that's right. -Circular wall. It looks like a tower of some kind. SIMCHA: You know what it looks like? It looks like a Nuraghi. -It is incredible. -Where is this? GEORGEOS: The information that Pantera gave, was that it was between Barbate and Zahara de los Atunes at 35 meters deep. SIMCHA: Is there any way to try to locate that site? JUAN: Well, yes, I, I think so. We know where we have to search. SIMCHA: We got to find this. We just got to find it. We now head to where Georgeos believes we'll find Pantera's dive site. It's a patch of water barely five miles long, only 10 miles from where we found the underwater discs. Armed with a 3D sonar, we're all optimistic that a discovery will soon be made. To my surprise, we're smack dab in the middle of a drug trafficking zone and we're now diving under the watchful eye of the Spanish Navy. The Atlantic Explorer scours the search area, going back and forth, creating a well-defined map of the ocean floor. While we wait to identify a specific target, I decide to call James Cameron to update him on the latest developments. Hey, Jim! JAMES (over computer): What's up, buddy? Where are you guys right now? YARON: Southern Spain. JAMES (over computer): Going outside the Pillars of Hercules now. SIMCHA: That's right. It's been going pretty good. The first site we identified, they found this debris field. It could be pieces of columns or maybe they're millstones and then there's a new thing that came up, okay? This legendary diver in these parts that they nicknamed The Panther, El Pantera, and El Pantera shot this video footage on VHS, I think. When I got images of it at the beginning I thought this is a joke. There's nothing but when I watched the still frame grabs, it looks like an underwater Nuraghi, like one of these Sardinia type. Like, it's big. It's got pillars. It's got. -Steps. SIMCHA: Steps. It's got circles. -Circles. SIMCHA: It's the Hollywood version of Atlantis and it's supposed to be right here where we are. JAMES (over computer): Do you have good coordinates on it? -It's 35 meters deep, between Barbate and Zahara de los Atunes. SIMCHA: This is a very sandy area. If you had, like, a submerged temple fully exposed, it would, it would stand out to sonar. We'll go up and down the grid and we'll, we'll find Atlantis, you know. JAMES (over computer): This sounds too good to be true. I'm not going to be up all night, you know, hoping on this, but, uh, let's see what happens. I think you gotta play out the lead for sure. Alright guys, great. I wish I was there on the ship with you right now. SIMCHA: In the meantime, Pantera's coordinates are not panning out. JUAN: Hello. Anything interesting? Anything that you have marked? Over. We are on our path and so far nothing, we continue searching. The bottom is flat and so far that's pretty much what we have. There is something there. Very big, very big! SIMCHA: They see an anomaly. Something rising from the bottom. Could this be the structure found by Pantera? JOSE: This is the place. BILL: This is it? This is all fish. JOSE: It's all fish but the fish may be inside a structure. We have a sandy bottom and then suddenly a small structure, you know? And then a lot of fish. BILL: Alright, I'll go tell the divers. JOSE: Jump from the side, no? RICHARD: Just like old times. Fantastic. DIVER (over radio): I could barely see anything. DIVER (over radio): It was just, the "vis" is not very good. SIMCHA: Floating just above them, I'm in radio contact with the divers. What's happening now guys, what's happening now? DIVER (over radio): The water is very murky. SIMCHA: Practically blinded, they follow the anchor line down to the bottom. Amazingly, the anchor leads them right on target. DIVER (over radio): Wow, this is amazing. SIMCHA: What are you seeing? DIVER (over radio): There are huge boulders down here. They just, just seem odd. SIMCHA: Are these the megalithic stones from Pantera's video? DIVER (over radio): I can't tell if these are man-made. SIMCHA: The divers disperse and find scattered rocks. DIVER (over radio): These might be discs that have been over grown with algae. SIMCHA: From certain angles they seem man-made, but it's hard to tell. Can you look around in the context, the archaeological context, can you see any wreckage? Any, anything? JUAN: We see a row of rocks. In my opinion it's very unlikely that they are a natural formation, because they seem scattered on the sand. Specifically, I see one rock that's almost perfectly semi-circular. -I think this is, this is great. DIVER (over radio): Current is undoubtedly picking up, and the swell, and the surge makes this dive quite challenging. SIMCHA: They need to surface. -Definitely more interesting. Lots of rocks, in quite almost an unnatural shape, but of course, your imagination starts to, kind of, uh, help a little bit and I'd really like to get some feedback from Ralph, because you know when your 40 meters down and your mind wants you to find something of interest, it's very easy to start to imagine things. So it'd be good to have a cold analytical, uh, view on what we found. -Uh, the current is going down so I think, uh, the ROV could, could go on itself. SIMCHA: In an attempt to get answers, Bill and the operators navigate the ROV to the dive site and analyze the incoming images. -Visibility is about a meter and a half. -It's whether they're man made, or geological, we don't really know. -That's a big structure, whatever that is. -Wow, whoa. SIMCHA: They call Ralph, the marine archaeologist, for further analysis. -What is it? SIMCHA: After several hours, Ralph can't come to a conclusion. The degradation process on the rocks has taken its toll. He can't determine if they're natural or man-made. If this was once Pantera's temple, only an underwater excavation can establish that now. The divers continue the search but no alternative site presents itself. Time starts running out on this expedition it's pretty, uh, tense situation, and if we don't find something here then we're gonna have to just change to another location. Reports on harsh weather force the captain to return to shore. We must temporarily abandon the search, not realizing that our luck is about to change. SIMCHA: The Atlantic Explorer is moored in port waiting for the sea to calm down. The crew uses this opportunity for inventory and maintenance. I'm thinking, if southern Spain is the original home of Atlantis and Sardinia was an Atlantean colony, why is there no archaeology here that matches the archaeology there? Georgeos thinks he's identified the missing link, a recently excavated 4,000-year-old Sardinian style temple. This is in the middle of nowhere and it was in the middle of nowhere in the Bronze Age, too. There's no cities around here and they did find Bronze Age burials. We're talking about 1,800 BC and look over here, a moat, surrounded by water, concentric circles built 700 years before the Nuraghes of Sardinia, I'm astounded to see so many features of Sardinian culture in this Spanish temple. It's like a maze. You come up to this place, it doesn't look like much, it's a mini version of what we saw in Sardinia, but look how complex it is, and you can see the themes. The moat, the concentric circles, you can't say this is a metaphor, this is Atlantean architecture as described by Plato. You have the compass points and in the middle, right over here, you have a deep, deep well. Can it be that some kind of water divinity is being worshipped, Poseidon, and look where it's situated. Once again, we see the same theme described by Plato, it's in the middle of a fertile plateau. This is not a city, it's not a house, it's not a castle. It's a temple, it's a place where people worship. ♪ ♪ Wow, being here, I feel like I'm inside a clockwork. This is so precise, look at the way the ramps lead you around. Look at the ramps of these towers, it's literally breathtaking and it's all the more breathtaking because it's unexpected. It looks like this tiny little structure that just looked like a mound until it was excavated some 30 years ago and it's very hard to date these things, but monks get buried in their monasteries and right over here archaeologists discovered and left in situ an ancient burial. So is this ground zero for an Atlantean culture, that later spread all the way to Sardinia? Did Pantera find a temple like this one underwater? I get word that the weather has cleared up, but on the way back, Georgeos has one more archaeological ace up his sleeve. High in the mountains, next to engraved concentric stone age circles, Georgeos has a particular image that he wants me to see. GEORGEOS: What do you see here? SIMCHA: I can't believe this, I see the biblical menorah. GEORGEOS: A Menorah! Concentric circles, Menorah! SIMCHA: You're saying the biblical menorah that was in the temple in Jerusalem that's in the book of Exodus, is an evolution of the Atlantean symbol of the concentric circles? GEORGEOS: I am convinced. -The menorah is somehow memorializing a symbol that meant something for thousands of years. GEORGEOS: The symbol of the city of Atlantis, cut in half, it's the Menorah. SIMCHA: Suddenly, I remember images of the menorah that I saw in 1,600-year-old Jewish burials in Malta. They looked exactly like Georgeos's symbol, complete with a central pole that was shaped like Poseidon's trident. This is kind of mind-blowing, because you're saying that there's an echo of Atlantean theology in the Bible itself. GEORGEOS: You got it, Simcha. SIMCHA: According to Georgeos, it's from shrines like this one that Atlantean refugees spread their symbols to the rest of the world. Back on the boat, we're ready to resume diving. -The Doñana Park is ground zero. I think this is where the original ancient mother city, port, island of Atlantis was located. The question is, what do you do next? SIMCHA: Clearly, we have a problem. If the port of Atlantis is buried deep beneath the mud flats of Doñana, then it's simply inaccessible to us, but I have an idea. In Laja Alta there were two squares depicted on the cave wall. If the square with the concentric circles depicts the port of Atlantis, then maybe the square with the ship represents something else, some kind of holding area or anchorage out at sea, where ships waited for entry into the fabled port. If such a holding area existed, then the most logical place for it would be near the closest island to the Strait of Gibraltar, Sancti Petri. I share my hunch with the team. It's a long shot, but we have no other leads. So we make our way to the target area. I see something. It's pretty straight GEORGEOS: Looks like a sequence of blocks. Seems to be a breakwater, a dock. SIMCHA: And this area here could be a holding area. GEORGEOS: I hope that we will find hard archaeological evidence of the existence of a really ancient civilization that can be connected with Atlantis. SIMCHA: Captain Jose Maria positions the ship. Tensions run high. -Good to go. SIMCHA: But what do we look for, ships? Wood rots over thousands of years but breakwaters, jetties, and stone anchors don't. DIVER (over radio): Are these docks? DIVER (over radio): Maybe they're breakwaters. ♪ ♪ SIMCHA: And then, finally, a huge, ancient stone anchor. Even Ralph, the ever-skeptical marine archaeologist is excited. -It's about this big, it's, uh, 83 centimeters across and it's, uh, about this thick and it's smooth on both sides, got a nice hole in it and, um, yeah, we were quite, quite surprised to see that. SIMCHA: After weeks of fruitless searching, everyone's excited when Ralph determines that the anchor could date to the Bronze Age. It fits the Atlantis timeline. These are stills? -These are stills, yeah. -It's really an amazing find. I mean, a lot of people who get excited about anchors, but this anchor, you should get very excited about. This is a 3,000-4,000-year-old anchor that is massive for a very, very large boat that shows us that ancient, large boats were sailing into this area 4,000 years ago. SIMCHA: It's widely believed that mankind did not sail into the Atlantic Ocean before the 8th Century BC. According to this idea, all fishing and trading routes in this area were confined to the Mediterranean Sea. This anchor tells a different story. We're on the Atlantic side. Who has seen stone anchors on this side of the ocean? -This is a place that hasn't been explored. So here we are, we're doing this stuff for the first time really, right, and we're finding stuff. SIMCHA: We're pushing the envelope. -We are pushing the envelope. -I wasn't, you know, very confident about these dive sites, but now I feel that the hope is going on. SIMCHA: But a single stone anchor could be just an anomaly, evidence of an ancient boat that went off course. We need more artifacts to support the idea that there once was a great holding area here. ♪ ♪ Edoardo, can you hear me? Edoardo (over radio): Uhh. SIMCHA: What trouble are you having? Edoardo (over radio): The current is serious, I wouldn't even just reflect the current, but a huge swell is beating us on the bottom. This current is so strong due to the flatness of the site. Whoa, this is something, this is a great one, incredible! I've never seen anything like that. SIMCHA: What are you seeing? Edoardo (over radio): I just found a, a square anchor, which is incredible. It's undoubtedly hand-made. It has a hole in the middle of it about the size of a fist. That's what we were looking for. Well, I'll tell you guys, it's something unbelievable. I'm moving very close to another anchor, undoubtedly for this area, it's an incredible find. Certainly is not a common object, not even in the Mediterranean, and we are in the Atlantic. SIMCHA: That's absolutely awesome. That's unbelievable. Edoardo (over radio): What a find, what a catch. Miguel is leading us with his reel, but undoubtedly, he is struggling very much. It's definitely very serious currents. SIMCHA: How many anchors do you see? Edoardo (over radio): I'm approaching now the 3rd one which has an oval shape and its maximum extension is probably 70, 75 or 80 centimeters long and it looks really in perfect shape. SIMCHA: This could be 3,500 years old, could be 4,000 years old and it establishes a harbor right here, where, you know, I didn't even dare dream to find anchors because it's easier to find a needle in a haystack than three Bronze Age anchors in the Atlantic. DIVER (Over radio): This means something, we are on the right track. SIMCHA: We've now discovered a total of four Bronze Age anchors on the Atlantean side of Spain, but our divers are not finished, an hour later they find a fifth, triangle shaped anchor. Edoardo (over radio): That, that's amazing. I really mean it, that's amazing. SIMCHA: And shortly after, anchor number six. I felt it, I felt good today. DINGHY: I told you we will do it. SIMCHA: You guys are awesome. DIVER (Over radio): I tell you, I'm so proud to be here. -You guys are making history! The implications of this find are mind-boggling. Our team found evidence of a holding area exactly where we predicted it would be. Was it great? -That was great, Simcha. -Yeah? -I really feel that we have done something serious. Thanks mate that was very good. GEORGEOS: It's amazing. I had a theory, but you guys found them. It's been thrilling, really thrilling. This is the most important moment of my life. SIMCHA: If the anchorage of Atlantis was out here, then maybe, just as Professor Freund theorizes, Atlantis is waiting to be found beneath the mudflats of Doñana and if the stone anchors witness to large ships, how far into the Atlantic Ocean could they have gone? Can we find evidence of their travels halfway to America? SIMCHA: Our team has found more Bronze Age anchors on the Atlantic side of Spain, than anyone before. If we found six in a few dives, there must be thousands out there, confirming Plato's report of a port just past the Pillars of Hercules. Plato also states that the ships of Atlantis sailed across the Atlantic, stopping at isolated islands en-route. To test this claim, we once again go west, all the way to the Azores: Portuguese islands located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. 3,500 years before Columbus, could Bronze Age sailors have made it here, almost a third of the way to America? It's a far-fetched idea. When Portuguese explorers first came to the Azores some 500 years ago, they claimed that these islands had never been inhabited, but recently, Professor Felix Rodrigues, from the University of the Azores, has made some incredible discoveries. I can't believe what we're looking at. This shouldn't be here, right, theoretically. -Right. -What is it? FELIX: Probably a columbarium at least Roman. -The Romans used it for burial, they'd cremate the body, they'd put urns and they'd put it in this columbarium. FELIX: Yes, it's a burial place because you have an oven there. -There's an oven there? -Yes. FELIX: And could explain this structure and give some sense to this. SIMCHA: I'm, I'm in shock because it establishes a culture here in very, very ancient times, right? Like, way before anybody thought there was anybody here. FELIX: This is true. This is amazing. Ancient people comes to the center of the Atlantic. SIMCHA: Remarkably, people here had customs similar to those practiced in the Mediterranean. They lived on these Atlantic islands 2,000 years ago, perhaps earlier. Professor Rodrigues has evidence that can push that date to the Bronze Age, or even before, to the time of Atlantis. Scattered across the cornfields of the Azores are massive, pyramid-like structures. These ancient buildings seem to have been connected to each other by an elaborate network of tunnels, which are now partially ruined, or blocked. I'm standing in a cornfield on Pico Island in the Azores, half way between Europe and the Americas. Behind me you can see an entrance to an ancient structure that academics have dubbed Neolithic. That's Stone Age. We're talking about thousands of years ago when, really, no one should have been able to get here. Now that is connected somehow to this pyramid right next door and the pyramid, it looks like an ancient ziggurat, it's like the Biblical tower of Babel. Maybe something Aztec almost looking, people don't know, because really, no one has studied it. Anybody looking at that can see that there's a pyramid over there, and some kind of ancient entrance blocked up. An archaeological treasure that hasn't been fully excavated. FELIX: This is a fantastic structure made by dry stones. SIMCHA: By dry stones you mean no cement? FELIX: No, no cement. This is well planned and you need a huge amount of dry stone to build this building. A partial excavation was made inside the chamber and it was found stone tools, ancient stone tools. That means this could be from the Stone Age! This is very weird for the Azores position. We need knowledge and lots of people to build this. SIMCHA: This is amazing. Again, Stone Age technology, we're talking four, five, 6,000 years old. The same technology that we've seen from the Eastern Mediterranean all the way to the Azores. Giant boulders stacked up on each other holding for thousands of years without cement and this time we're not in the Mediterranean, it's part of some kind of civilization that reached all the way to the Atlantic and there's even more evidence of ancient inhabitants on the island. I trek with Professor Rodrigues through a thick forest to see a Stone Age village, which contains megalithic structures, very similar to those I saw on Malta, 2,200 miles away! FELIX: It's very slippery guys, super slippery here. SIMCHA: Professor Rodrigues discovered this place in 2014. Based on the stone tools found here, he believes the village may be 6,000 years old, and yet, it's virtually unknown to the academic world. Professor Rodrigues has even discovered a man-made cave in this ancient settlement. This is incredible. This, out of the megalithic structures that we've seen, this is the most sophisticated one. Maybe it was someone's home, maybe, you know, the chief, but maybe, it was, uh, some kind of holy place. We may be in an early, early shrine. There's an outer section to it, and an inner chamber, which is kind of the inner Holy of Holies as a shrine. Outside the forest, Professor Rodrigues shows me an artifact that is totally out of place on this modern farm. It's a piece of archaeology, which can radically redefine our understanding of Stone Age seafaring. What is that? FELIX: It's a Stone Age anchor. SIMCHA: This is amazing to find it here. What's it doing inside a fence? FELIX: It's used as a stone, a normal stone. SIMCHA: The farmer was just collecting? FELIX: Yes, collecting from here and put it in the wall. SIMCHA: Uh, I got to tell you, I can show you stuff like this that we discovered underwater in southern Spain. In fact, this is much bigger than what we shot. Because we found ones, kind of elliptical, half that size with one hole. This has two holes, it must have been a giant boat. FELIX: This is something huge! SIMCHA: If there's an anchor here, and there's a stone age village, it must have been near, near the harbor, near the water. FELIX: We have two water lines, one on each side of the hill, little rivers that go straight to the sea. SIMCHA: You're re-writing the history of human travel in the Stone Age. FELIX: This could help to describe the ancient people movement between different spaces in the world. SIMCHA: Professor Rodrigues now shows me another incredible discovery. This is amazing, these are cart ruts. FELIX: Yes, this is cart ruts, clearly cart ruts. Similar to those one of Malta. Comes from nowhere and goes to somewhere in the sea. In the middle of the island, we have lots of cart ruts. SIMCHA: All over the islands? FELIX: All the islands, except the smallest one. SIMCHA: And they haven't really been studied? FELIX: None, none of them. SIMCHA: When do you think these cart ruts date to? FELIX: From the third millennium BC. SIMCHA: 3rd millennium BC. Wow. You know when we started this journey, cart ruts didn't mean anything to me, but then when you see this technology, sophisticated technology, mysterious technology, on all these islands: Malta, Sardinia, Sicily, now the Azores. We're talking about Stone Age people getting to all these places creating this technology, using it for a long time, but nobody knows why or how, it's amazing, but one thing it does do, it actually puts people on this island, and shows that people could get here by boat more than 4,000 years ago, 6,000 years ago maybe. It now seems clear to me that even before the pyramids in Egypt, there existed a Stone Age and Bronze Age civilization, an ancient long forgotten empire. Its center seems to have been in southern Spain, exactly where Plato puts Atlantis. I now believe that this civilization shared a common culture, architecture, and great seafaring capability as Plato's Atlantis. This empire was most probably destroyed in a series of Santorini related natural disasters. It seems that Plato's Atlantis is no mere myth. Hey, Jim, we did it. JAMES (over phone): You did it, you found great stuff, you found the anchors. You've proved that there's a trading culture out in the Atlantic beyond the Pillars of Hercules. This is fantastic evidence, but did you locate Atlantis? Well, maybe? You know, Atlantis could be buried under the mud at Tartessos. We need to investigate that further. I'm saying prove it, find it and dig it up. Captioned by Cotter Captioning Services.
