(wind whistling) (waves lapping) (contemplative music) (ducks squawking) (waves lapping) (rifle bangs) (rifle bangs) (dog barking) - [Puccini Voiceover] Is this how you see me and my work? Is it? You tell me of the beauty, the peace, the loveliness of this blue lake. (rifle bangs) This little blue lake surrounded by reeds and peace. An Eden. (rifle bangs) A paradise. But no one remembers now about the women here, in Torre del Lago. (dog barking) (rifle bangs) (priest praying in Latin) (bell chiming) (priest praying in Latin) (bell chiming) (priest praying in Latin) Nor do they remember the failures. "Madame Butterfly," booed off the stage. "La Boheme," loathed by the critics. (dog barking) (waves lapping) Oh, they whistle them now. They whistle them now. But they whistled "La Boheme" in a different way the first night it was performed. A straight up-and-down veritable disaster! Crystal clear. A dud. And the librettists. The librettists! Ugh, the librettists! They want so to struggle. Their mark. Their mark! One can hardly find a story for their signatures! Do you know what I say to you? (rifle bangs) I want to make people weep. Because (laughs) therein lies everything. But do you think this is easy? Love and grief were born with the world and we who have passed the half century know full well the impact of both. Once, once... So long ago. (yelling) - Come on then. Sit, boy! Sit, sit! Sit, sit! Ah (mumbles). - Take it. - Not now. - Take it, snob (mumbling). - No, no, no. (laughing) - You'll eat my bread, won't you? Freshly baked by Doria. Whoa, poor, poor ducks, Doria! Poor, poor ducks! That mad novelist reader, she screams at me across the lake, "Murderer, vivisectionist!" "Poor, poor ducks!" - Yeah! - "Shot by that monster, Puccini." And now they're going to be eaten! Here, Doria, you take a brace to your father. - Ahh! - Here (quacks). (laughing) And you better give a brace to Father Michelucci. Remember, Doria. Poor, poor ducks! (laughs) (braying) (momentous music) (music swells) (whistles) - Shh! Shh, shh, shh! (muffled speaking from women) - [Merchant Woman] 65. - You can't pay that! - Oh, Giacomo, go away, I shall pay what I think fit. - But I can get it for much less. - I've no doubt you can, they sell to you cheap! - I don't think you try hard enough. - You keep out of this, girl. They're all your cousins. - No, no, I can't pay that, it's too much! I am a poor man! (speaking foreign language) 40. - 45. - Done! - Thank you. (coins clinking) (clicks tongue at horse) (laughing) - There you are! You blame me for the high price of things and when they sell to you cheap simply because you are the Maestro Puccini. - I don't blame you, Elvira. - You do! I am simply the woman of Puccini. - Nonsense. - A woman of Puccini. - You are not named the woman of Puccini here. You are my wife, they all know that. La Donna Puccini! We were married, here. They know that. - You look younger every day. (laughs) They've nothing but contempt for me. They know about you and your women! (engine rumbles) - I don't wish to discuss this in the marketplace. (buoyant music) - Came to us in 1891. - Is it that long-- - To the village. - ago? I know he was writing "Manon." - They're all women. I was with him, when he went in from his first show. - Not all. "Boheme." - Yes, well... - Most of them. There was Madame Lescaut, Tosca. - "A shabby little shocker." - What? - Some called it that. And then there's "Madame Butterfly." - [Umberto] There you are, you see? All named after women, eh? Are you surprised? (muttering) Then he married. January, 1904. - They couldn't marry before. She was still married. - I know! I was a witness. - I knew him. Narciso Gemignani, from Luca. - They're all from Luca. It was quite a scandal. A very old family connected with the church, the Puccini family. - He died. I knew him. Before he died. - They thought he had died before, her husband. - No, just the once. - And then he hadn't, in Luca. - Of course, he spends a lot of time in Milan, the Maestro. I know, because he always says to me, "Thank God "he's back from Milan" or (mutters). - (clears throat) What does he call this one? - It's American. - All American. - To do with the Wild West. - His "Golden Girl," he calls it. "La Fanciulla." - There! Another woman! - Yeah. - Proves my point, rather. - Mm. (lighthearted music) (sighs) (brisk piano music) (singing in Italian) (muffled speaking) - I mean, I noticed it last night. (speaking Italian), apart. - It's because we don't bring the leg up to the final step, to bring it together, like that. And then there's one, out. - Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh! - We've got to keep it going at the same tempo. - Okay, well, just try that with the front six. (singing in Italian) - Shh, shh! - It's good that we've got the actors, because if I can borrow this, I now see one of the problems, 'cause one of the problems is that when you lunge forward like that, what you're tending to do is to go sort of doing this as well as this, so actually what's happening is kind of that. Shh, please keep quiet! You're doing... There's a kind of, there's a double action going on. 'Cause it does look awfully scrappy. Actually it's impossible, it's an idiotic extraction I have given you. Don't forget that Puccini is not using a chorus in a conventional matter. Much more like a Greek chorus. Almost as if you're today's audience, commenting on something that happened a long time ago. So all your gestures are also comments of some sort. 'Cause that's what they're doing with their swords after all. - Flat on or in? - Flat on, flat on. Try and avoid hitting the people in the front. (laughing) - Thank you. - We wouldn't want him to be hit. Okay, let's just try the same place again. - [Puccini] Ah, the relatives. They look like an avenging chorus come to drown the tenor. (stifled laughter) - What are you talking about? (laughs) Are you talking about your work? - No, but I will if you wish me to. What do you want me to talk about? The rehearsals? - Ah. (laughs) - Yes, you always like to hear about the rehearsals. The bickerings, the quarreling. Who wore what? Who said what? Who didn't wear what? Who didn't whom tell what? What? (Giacomo and Elvira laughing) The libretto is full of men, all striding about in transports of rage wearing cowboy hats and firing pistols and lynching and drinking and playing poker! Yes, I've got them playing poker and it sounds terrible on the piano. It will sound even worse with the orchestra, there! I've exhausted that. My girl from the west. - Which girl? - From the west, it's a figment. I told the librettists, I told them, they could have as many characters as they wanted, but they must put three or four women on the stage. It's very important to me. The voice of a woman is so beautiful. Her voice can weave its way through her flowers and children and grief and love and... Such possibilities. They gave me one. And a squall. But one golden girl is enough for me. - How am I to believe that? - Well, of course you must, my dear wife. - Your father loves me when I forgive him, when in tears and reconciliation we embrace each other. And he vows never to be unfaithful again, then he loves me. Almost never at any other time. - (laughs) Elvira, what stuff! - You, girl? Tell me, what do you think? Speak. I know what you say in Torre del Lago. - Signora? - The girl carries tales. She won't tell you, won't tell me, but she does. - [Puccini] Elvira! - She'd better not deny it, because I can tell her all about it. All about it! That's that. Look at her. Guilty as sin. - [Puccini] Elvira, I think you've said enough. - I hope so. I hope I need to say no more. (somber music) - No, no, no. Your mother (muffled speaking) unwell, but those relatives of hers. yours, ours, are very compliant. Did you see the way they just sit there? Huh, poor girl. Tony, what is it your mother feels? Not poverty, surely. I know I haggle about the price of this and that, but that's just my way. There is no chance of poverty ever again, thank God. That is all behind us. (sighs) Old age. Is that what she fears? Well, I understand that. We both fear that in our own ways. There is a doctor does wonderful things in Switzerland. We could both go, at the right time, and then come back. - My mother is upset by your... Forgive me, father, but so am I upset by your... You say you... - There. Did you see the way his lip curled? The look in your eyes is the same look of contempt that I see in your mother's eyes. The same scorn. You look at me and your look tells me the word I understand. And, so, to my affairs of the heart. The root and very source of the scorn. And, you know, they are of no importance to me. Necessary to me only as a new and beautiful fast-traveling car is necessary. Do you know what I say, Antonio? No, you don't. He doesn't, agh. Simply, artists need motorcars and speedboats and guns and women who are not important, who get more out of me than I get out of them. Just simple women, as women in the field. Just ordinary women. Waitresses, shop girls, laundresses, schoolteachers. That sort of woman. I cultivate them as my little gardens. For my own ends, for my own relief. And that's all. We all do it. Even Toscanini, I'm told, does it. Large, fleshy singers in his case, I'm told. Oh, if only I could write a work that was not fantasy but my own life. But I cannot do it. I cannot do it. - If you remember what the original brief was, we wanted this room to be absolutely naturalistic, okay? - Yes. - Puccini, Calaf's room shoved to one side, against which you had the feeling as though some big city, we didn't know where it was. - Mm-hmm. - You remember that letter Puccini wrote? The setting of Turandot really didn't matter, he said. It could, what was it, just as well be in Peking or even Norway, didn't he say? It could have been. It's somewhere else and it's somewhere artificial. - Yes. - Now what you want is something which doesn't look like paint-by-numbers. It looks like someone has opened a kind of palette with ten different colors of browns. - Well, that was the intention, actually. - But the problem with the room, Ken, is that no matter what color you've painted, it always seems to be in the way. All of the time. - Well, that's why we made it out of creche back, so that-- - Well, that I know. - Because they can see through it to the conductor, or vice versa. - But those blobs I saw, I mean, you're joking, I've already got endless chorus people coming up to me saying they can't see anything that's going on. These blobs are just too dense. - Well, we have reduced them already. We've made them lighter and the samples are there for you to see actually, if you want to go and see them. - When I went down to the workshops, I mean it really looked like someone had been sick all over them. I mean, why are they such an extraordinary color? - Well, that is the color of his original room, actually. But I admit they're too bright at the moment. We will take them down a bit. - But I mean, they look as if they've come straight out of a habitat. - Yeah, it's true, yes. - I mean, his house is a bit more battered than that. (gentle piano music) - [Fucini] What sort of girl would go and live in such a household? - [Umberto] The girl is my niece. And she was warned. - Did you? - Hmm. - And so you should. - Warnings! - [Fucini] Knowing the man's liking for simple girls. - [Giacchi] Oh, really he did. - [Umberto] She does dote on him. - [Fucini] Well, she is a very simple girl. And their only servant. If you don't count the man, Luigi. - What does he say? - Ahh, it'll all blow over with it. - Gah... What does the Maestro say? (laughing) - What can he say? We all know what he's like. His reputation is enough. - He is insatiable. - Yeah, but is it all true? Putting aside stories of girls beat from the doors with umbrellas. - That's true, I saw it. La Donna Puccini thrashed her with an umbrella. - Well, they couldn't marry for years. - Ah, La Donna resented that. - It is my opinion, putting aside such stories. - The woman in the woods. The schoolteacher from Viareggio. - True or not? - Every Thursday. In a chalet. - [Fucini] According to the world's ancient law. - She is of that age. - Oh, yeah. - It is the misfortune of women, in my experience. And I speak as a medical man, wedded to science. They tend to look old when they are old, whereas men do not often look as old as they are, at first glance, because of waistcoats, good suits cut well, long broadcloth coats, fitted shoes and a gold chain. The years drop off the shoulders of a man of known genius in alpaca cloth, silk scarves, a collar turned up. Success. And Maestro Puccini has had tremendous success with the public. Though, under it all, he rots down like the rest of us. The girl is pretty, and a daughter of the village. Doria, she's a Manfredi. - The whole village is Manfredi. - You must have known he would. - As I am a Manfredi, I'll honor, if he has... - The three of us in the garden will sing of love until the morning. - I don't see, uh, forgive me, Manfredi. I don't see what he sees in girls of such simple mentality, who could have had the pick of the European stage! And America, no doubt. - Caruso was arrested in America, just for little pinches of admiration in Central Park. - (clucks tongue) Seduced by music. - He is, I fear-- - He could be shot. - rightly called "The Maestro of the Brothel." (gentle music) (humming) - [Puccini Voiceover] I remember once I was staying in the Hotel Bristol. In Vienna. Was it? I received, as usual, a proposition. The woman sounded so sensible on the telephone. So sensible and so restful. (humming) So soothing. (knocking on door) - Come in! - So adoring. She adored me on the telephone, this woman. Her voice was so promising, so inspiring! All she wanted was to accompany her daughter on the piano. A singer? No! - Well, Fraulein, since we insist on playing your violin, I must gird myself. I shall dress. You will begin your piece. (humming) - [Puccini Voiceover] No, a violin! Do you see it? A brat with a violin! I am to be subjected to a piece! (humming) Soon as I saw the violin I knew: Mozart. It's always poor Mozart who suffers more than we do. (humming) Poor, crazed creature! Not a stitch on her body! While I dressed, she had undressed, taken the lot off in the Hotel Bristol! - Mm, it's just a bit of Chinese silk. - Oh. - Here, look. Does that fit better? When your hair's a bit shorter. - No, I think that's still too tight. (piano plays passionately) (singing in Italian) - Okay, that's terrific. That's absolutely right, I mean it's just a boom, like that! - [Actor] Yeah. - And exactly as you did. The degree of bitterness was spot on. People are stupid-- - Yeah. - to believe that you actually can love one another in a very straightforward, simple, innocent way. And if you do go on believing that through life, if you maintain that kind of childlike naivete, then you'll all be swept away. That's in effect what you're saying. And Puccini uses Ping, Pang, and Pong throughout not just as flatfooted mandarins, which is what we normally see on stage, not just as city officials, but constantly to point out the moral of what we're seeing. As you know, Puccini never finished Turandot, his last opera, because, we've always believed, he got throat cancer and died. In fact, as we now know, he made many attempts to finish it long before he died. And Eva Turner, who was at the very first performance, told me that when she talked to Alfono, Puccini's pupil, who did actually finish the opera, that Alfono had told her that he always had the impression that the master never wanted the piece finished. In other words, perhaps there was an emotional, psychological blockage. He couldn't finish it! (disquieting music) (boat engine chugging) - She's been seen wearing my clothes, to follow me and spy on me. - [Giulio] Elvira? - Mm-hmm. - [Giulio] She's like a daughter to me. As you were a son. - [Puccini] I know. But how can I convince her that I will never forsake her? - Women are insecure. Times change. - Nothing has changed between us. Nothing at all. Took her. Another man's wife. A friend. Should I have married her? - You're tormenting yourselves about something which doesn't exist. As you've never regarded your behavior as any kind of betrayal. Have you? - [Puccini] Fair, no. - You have not. Nor is it. Think of working? - I touch the keys of my piano and my fingers are covered in dust. In fits and starts. Don't despair. - Oh, I don't despair. The libretto is good enough at last, hmm? - You know what you are, don't you? - Hmm? - My best of poets. My mender of other mens' thoughts. - Good, I try. - But is it worth it? What is there gonna be in it for me? - As your publisher, with my eye on the long run... - My hands are covered in dust. - Could I ask you, I ask you this as a friend as well, put aside your fears, the turmoil of Elvira. She understands everything about you and about herself. She knows what she does, but she's powerless. She knows of your love for her. - My untidy desk is a sea of letters, but not a trace of music. Gah! Music is useless! - Might be better for her and for you perhaps if you went away. - We went-- - Oh, I know. - to Egypt. We neither of us liked it. Like Aida. Too much orchestra in the sun. - Oh (laughs). Yes. - Years ago, when you first met me, you met a young man who was commanded by the almighty to write for the theater and I have done it, haven't I? Shouldn't I feel more secure? Feet firmly planted on the ground? It's not true. The earth slides away from me as I walk. No hands to catch me! No one to help me write something of substance! Why do librettists always argue? And it's always the same argument! Too many words. - Too many ducks to shoot. - You should take some back with you. It's been a good year. - Do you hear from Sybil Seligman? - We correspond. - Go to her in London. - No! - You can work in London. I know she looks for stories for you. Relive old times together! Leave Elvira for a while. Oh, I don't ask you to forget her, of course, look, she's your wife. But stop thinking about her. Enjoy Sybil again. - But without Elvira, I am bewildered. (shrill screaming) (serious music) In the dark night, a dazzling phantom flies. Love, it spreads its wings and rises over humanity. Everyone invokes it, everyone implores it, but the phantom disappears at dawn to be reborn in the heart. And every night it is born and every day it dies. My kiss will break the silence that makes you mine. She who makes us dream, though we are dead, no one shall know your name, love. There must be a story that would hold us with its poetry and speak directly of our love. Of my love, of my grief. And inspire me to the possibility of making an opera out of it. (laughs) (music box chiming) (intense orchestral music) - [Conductor] Don't get high! Let's keep together now! More, more please! Violent Handel! (music becomes peaceful) Now just hold on the beat! Hold on the beat, please! It's all flexible. If I go faster, go faster. Go slow, go slower. You're not together. "Poco rallentando." It says "poco rallentando," but it's very flexible. - Stuart, why isn't it possible to have some sort of hydraulic arm which can move Turandot out from her balcony here on the right so that she appears to float over the whole stage? - We had the long rigid arm which was going to be impractical because of length and turning circle and what-have-you in smaller theaters. We then had the telescopic arm, which, after they'd worked out the device to make the telescope work, found out that it's going to come out at 2.8 tons. That is including the truck. - But are you seriously telling me that there's no stage in bonnie wee Scotland that can take two and a half tons? You must have a bigger way-- - I'm telling you that there's a stage in Scotland that can take it, but I wouldn't take it on tour. - You mean to stages in England? (laughs) - England, funnily enough, yes. - I see. - Leicester and Liverpool are all the theaters. - Well, I'm going to make an executive decision. I think we should build this arm, because it'll make a spectacular moment as it crashes through the stage. - Yes. An English stage. - An English stage, you're not prepared to go along with this? - No. - Coward! (laughing) Is that the real piano at last? Ah, goody, goody, goody. (wooden knock) (laughing) Why can't we have... (wooden knocking) - [Stage Designer] Well, it's too heavy, we've had to remove-- - Stuart, what is the problem with having real candles? Is it the fire authorities here won't let you have them? - No, the fire authorities here, at the moment, they're accepting live flame on stage. - [Director] Right. - Up to a degree. But on tour-- - What does that mean? - It means that they will probably let the two candles go that you're asking for here. - [Director] Mm-hmm. But what about the torch-- - They judge every case on its own merit. - [Director] You mean they think I'm an arsonist and have come to set fire to, or a pyrotechnicist or whatever the word is. - They assume that, yeah. But they probably will agree to this. - Right, well, that's it. - But when we go on tour, there are some theaters which will accept no live flame. - Really? - [Stuart] No live flame. - Well, that's ridiculous! I mean, why is that, because the theaters are in-- - Because of fire hazard. - Will they accept live food? (tense music) (saw buzzing) - [Conductor] Go on now, faster, faster! Don't get high! (buzzing) Don't get high! (music becomes jaunty) Damn it, I want you to go a little bit faster! - Why are they so pernickety? I mean, is it the... - Because theaters invariably burn down. - You don't say! - They have. I got plans! (passionate music) - [Director] Well, what about Calaf, can't we give him some sort of Chinese dressing gown or something? - Well, that, I thought do those two which are Edwardian, but do them in Chinese silks so you get the Chinese feel about it without... And it's also, you know, fair to the character. - Are you paying the bill? Chinese silk? - Oh, it's not that expensive. - Isn't it? - No. The Arts Council will help me out there. (laughing) - The Scottish Arts Council, no doubt, no doubt. - Yeah (laughs). - I mean, it removes him from being obviously Italian. But what about Liu? - [Costume Designer] Liu, well, she is in an Italian setting rather than a Chinese setting. - That's true, but that's much too simple. - Oh, well, I suppose she could wear a Chinese mask? - No, I'm serious, though. I mean, I just think it's much too simple. (brooding music) (hissing) (laughing) (laughing grows manic) (music intensifies) - Come out of there, Doria! I know! I'm going to drag you! I'm going to drag you through the village! (Elvira sobbing) (music intensifies) - Far too much work for you. - I don't mind. - We must, um... - I like ironing. - I know you do, child. But we must think of engaging someone else so that you don't have to work too hard. - I'm going to bed now. - Yes. Well, it will keep until tomorrow-- - Oh, yes. Oh, yes, I knew. You're a... (laughs) I knew! (laughs) I see you both together, now at last all is clear. You fornicate with my husband. - Elvira, what nonsense! - Oh, no, no, no, it isn't nonsense! There she is, there with you (mutters). I always knew she was a... I always knew it. Get out of my sight. Get out of my sight! You bitch! (screaming) Oh, where is she! (moaning) Oh, where is she! (plate smashes) Oh, where is she! I must get her! I knew all the time! (serious music) (knocking) I'm going to drag you through the village! For everyone to see your shame, your shame! Come on, I'm telling you to come out, Doria! I'm going to drag you through the-- - Elvira! You are my one true (sobbing) and constant love, and that is the truth, whatever you think. My home, my laying down place. - Women in trains, women in hotels, women in forests, in dressing rooms, on the stages, in broom cupboards, the shores of lakes, women in sculleries and kitchens. - You're nervous, you're as taut as ropes. Calm down, please! Please, Elvira! You are my love-- - I am not anyone's! No one will ever possess me. Don't you ever think of death? - I would think of it if I lost your love entirely. (somber music) - [Director] And here is this woman who longs to be held by a man. She found a man she fancies. Now, how do I get from the position of having always said "Do not touch me." - Mm-hmm. - "Never, ever touch me" - to admitting that I want to be held and cuddled and made love to? What does a woman like? Well, a bunch of flowers. - Mm-hmm. - What is the way to a woman's heart? Well, he knows it, he's been through it all before. - Mm-hmm. - I mean, it just makes it a much more human tragedy. And it's then believable for the audience. Here isn't just an ice maiden, Turandot, who crumbles mysteriously because of the death of Liu or whatever it is. Here is a woman aching to be loved and held, like every other woman who has ever lived. - There, there, I know. (Elvira whimpering) Some sleep and you'll feel better. I'll get Dr. Giacchi. What do you think? (Elvira whimpers) Let him give you something. Oh, my dear, my dear! You are my dear! (Elvira sobs) (contemplative music) - [Puccini Voiceover] This woman, what is she? The times we've touched hands and it's been enough. And the other times, the aching times when to touch hands would be impossible. Is there nothing she feels for me? An opportunity gone. Just a smile required, a letter, a laugh. What a waste. What a cruel, teasing preliminary to the long love, the only love. Love of each other so profound that it is so ordinary. (loud humming) - He was out today, the Maestro! She caught him at it! (laughing) Viareggio, he has a woman there. - Where doesn't he have a woman? - She's a waitress at the Achille d'Oro. She puts camphor in his pocket beside his balls. (laughing) His wife. - What does it do? - He says she puts things in the coffee. Don't drink the coffee! I drink it, but then at my age I welcome the rest. - Does it work? - What? - Camphor. No. Might kill moths, but not butterflies, eh? (laughing) (singing in Italian) (conductor humming) - The point about the bottle is, when you bring it out, what I don't want to happen is that it is obvious that you get the knife and do that to yourself. - Mm-hmm. - So therefore it is possible that you could have taken poison. - Mm-hmm. - Because the relationship with Doria might or might not be there. Except that your character, Liu, who kills herself with a knife for love didn't exist in the original play from which Puccini took his story, nor indeed in the first draft of the libretto. Puccini invented the entire character. So it's not simply because Doria took poison and died that I want you have the bottle. It is I want you to have the bread knife so it's possible that we believe that that's actually what you're gonna do. - Okay. (somber music) (climactic piano music) (singing in Italian) - Yeah, yeah, shall I show you what you did? Shall I show you what you did? Watch me, watch me. That was wonderful, that time. You can do it. You can bring it down, then build it. You came round like this. My goodness. What is this I see before me? (laughing) Is it a dead body? Wow! (laughs) Okay, you've rushed away with the emotion of it to get here. Okay, so she's clunked upon the floor. So, I mean, it's really absolutely... It's a sudden, it's a parried turn, then, you know... - It's the slow realizing emotions of opera, they take a long time to realize. - This is drama, kid, not opera. (somber music) - I am very sorry, Doria. I apologize for my wife. She'll feel sorry too when she's had a rest. But she's not well, you see. She's tired. I should probably take her away for a few days. And I'll probably get the doctor to come and have a look at her. I'd ask you to go up and fetch Giacchi or Umberto. This is something she will feel very sorry about. Because she's so fond of you, she's always saying she is. Well, we both are, but she more than I. How long have you been with us now? Three years. And you do everything for us. When I had my motorcar accident, since then you've been completely irreplaceable. I drive too fast. Are you feeling better now, Doria? Good. Do you think you'll be able to get through the day? Good. I ought to try and do some work! It's too late to go after the ducks. And you shouldn't bake that beautiful bread. I can't eat it, I mustn't eat it because of my diabetes. Well, my wife can't fault your bread. Yes, I shall take my wife away, if my work allows it, somewhere. And you can be on your own for a while. But you know, Doria, I hate cities. I do, I hate them! Here I flee for peace. Elvira has always known about my... My... Perhaps we shouldn't have married. It has got worse since I married her. You will marry, Doria. I must get back to work. Puccini, back to work! And if I might have another cup of your delicious China tea in my study... - Signor, I am so ashamed! (Doria sniffles) - But there is nothing to be ashamed about. Is there? I shall wear my hat so that you will recognize me! (somber music) (waves lapping) (men laughing) (mock kissing) (singing) (clears throat) (plays piano note) (singing) - This is the second one, isn't it? - This is Act Two. - This is the singing event. - Yeah, that's right. - Can I breathe? (laughs) - Yeah, you're walking in this one, aren't you? Yeah (laughs). - That's right, not too much though. All I do is kneel. - Oh, you don't... How do you get on the stage? I mean, are you discovered there? - A bath, Jean, actually, I think. (laughing) No, I'm there, I walk from the back on up to the podium and then I come off it and kneel. That's all I do, there's not a lot, it's not an action part. - This first bit is a sort of statement of the... - Statement and a feeling of the voice, whether I should just go home. - That's right. (laughing) - Yes, well. - And then we really get started here, that shirt, it colors it. - Well, the point is, I always think that the extraordinary thing about "In questa reggia" or it seems to me increasing the more we rehearse it is that not only is it the focal point of the opera, but it's actually musically and emotionally a summary of absolutely everything else in Puccini's own immense creative output. - The crux of who Martiri is. - That's right. So when Turandot, the eternal bride, the woman for whom no man is enough sings "In questa reggia" within this palace, this world almost, "No one shall touch me," why? Because her ancestor, Liu Ling, had been violated. Then Turandot becomes not only the embodiment of Elvira and what she came to believe, but I think is also the expression of what Puccini himself believed. So that gives the whole of Turandot that curious tension, because you've got on the one hand the woman is doing this, "Please come and get me, I want to be cuddled, "I want to be loved." - Yeah. - And the other hand is doing that. "Don't touch me." - "Stay away." (waves lapping) (singing "In questa reggia") (doorknob clunks) - Perhaps you oughtn't to be up here. Let me feel your brow. I wonder oughtn't Dr. Giacchi to have a look at you? No? - No. - Oh. Very well. But do you think you can eat something? - I can eat. - Good, you must be hungry. And so am I. I often think all this coffee I drink-- (glass clinks) oop, blunts my appetite. What do you think? - I don't care. - No. However, today I think-- - What'd you say? - I said I was hungry. - What'd you say you could eat? - Nothing, it doesn't matter. (dishes clinking) - Where did you do it with my husband? Whore. - Elvira! (catastrophic music) - On the table? In the bushes? Up against the wall? Where! Get out of my house! (screams) Whore! (dog barking) (dramatic opera music) (plate smashing) (music fades) - What can one expect? - With such a man as the Maestro Puccini? He has his little friends everywhere. - Oh! - We cannot blame the Maestro. We love you, Doria. We were proud when you went to work for the Maestro Puccini, the most famous man in the world! In all of Italy! And La Donna Puccini... - For the church, La Donna Puccini has offered me some money and she has told me that you are a simple and sensible girl and that you will confess your behavior and repent fully your sin and wash it away. Tell me all. - [Doria] It isn't true. - Child. - It isn't true! It isn't true. - I wonder what's going to happen at that house. He's like a rabbit, the Maestro, a musical rabbit! And that poor woman. - [Doria] No, it isn't true! (many voices talking) It isn't true! It isn't true! - Child. - It isn't true, it isn't true! No, it isn't true! - Child! - It isn't true! - Child! - It isn't true! (sobbing) - Three, four. (choir sings in Italian) You get all these vowels in (speaking Italian). And then you run them together. (choir conductor speaks Italian) (children speak Italian) (choir conductor speaks Italian) (children speak Italian) You see? (choir conductor speaks Italian) (children speak Italian) (choir conductor speaks Italian) (children speak Italian) - Three, four. (children sing in Italian) (music becomes fuller) (priest speaks Latin) - Did he tell you I'm going home till Monday? - No, he didn't. He said you want to tell me something. He said it's not bad. - Well, I'm going home till Monday. - It's not bad (laughs). - I've asked Tony. - It's not good without you. - Well, the thing is my voice is hanging in here all right. - Mm-hmm. - But I feel that when I can't mark properly, there's no point in it. And the only way that I'm ever going to make it is to go away till Monday. - No, we're going to talk through Act Two today. - [Conductor] Yes. - I mean, this morning, to make sure there are no problems in terms of interpretation. - Yes. - The thing is that I know now what Tony wants and I'm able to do it. I know I can sing it, but if I don't rest my voice, I'm standing in this echo, can I move? (laughing) Then I'm never going to be, I mean I'm coming back on Monday, come what may. I'm really sorry. I mean, and you know this is not my cup of tea, I hate doing it. - Oh, yes. - But it's lost if I don't. - Sure. (triumphant choral music) (priest speaking Latin) - When I arrived this morning I had a really very tearful conversation with her. I just said "I think psychologically "if you go home now, "you'll get stuck among home comforts "and you won't even want to come back." Either way, we lose. - Well, she knows her own voice, how the voice is behaving and she's confident that it's-- - But she's behaving just like Turandot or Elvira, for that matter. - She's had a cold and you can still hear. You can sing through a cold but it's not very wise. - Yeah. - Not for Turandot, you know. - No. But do you think it's just the cold? (bright music) (birds chirping) - Hmm? - She attempted to take communion. - Incense and sacrifices. - Though she will not confess. - I said it would happen. The man is a libertine. - I've seen her. She will not eat or drink. - I think, as a lawyer, there might be a case in it if the girl tells the truth. - But she won't! Father Michelucci has asked it. Ah, the singing and moaning priests! - The poor girl is undoubtedly languishing. - Ah. That might be the case. - Do you think so? - From guilt or from shame. People have died of shame. - And from persecution. - The girl will not confess. - How is she persecuted? - Well, she is if she's innocent. - I must try to get her to admit her guilt. Manfredi! - Hmm? - Yeah? (somber music) (footsteps) (sighs) - Maestro. What can I say? - Manfredi. Whatever they say about your daughter, it is not true. I am glad to have the opportunity to say this to you. I have had nothing to do with your daughter other than the day-to-day existence of master and servant. I am very fond of your daughter, you know that. But I swear to you, she's as pure as the first day she came to us. - Signor Maestro, forgive me, but you have a reputation. (Puccini scoffs) - Do you love your daughter? - Before God. - What does she say? - It's difficult to believe a young girl. - But what does she say? - Your wife swears she caught you with my daughter. - My wife is wrong. - Yes. - Does Doria admit to it? - There are men like you. I don't hold anything against you. I understand. It does not mean that you don't love your wife. It does not mean that you fall in love with other women. I understand. There are times when you seek the company of women. I know. - Manfredi, please believe me! - Always. She has a deep admiration for you. - Well, if that is so, I am not aware of it. - Come out, Doria Manfredi! I intend to drown you! Nothing will stop me from drowning you! Not the Madonna herself! You will suffer for your sins! You will suffer for the day you crawled naked in my... Why don't you whip her? Why don't you whip her and brand her, you? Which of your husbands will be safe with such as her twitching her skirts? - I found them. I found them both together, at dead of night. It's been going on for years! (knocking) (sobbing) (somber music) - [Puccini Voiceover] My life is a sea of sadness in which I am becalmed yet so many people say how enviable my life is. I must truly have been born under an unhappy star. I am loved by no one. Do you hear me? No one. Ah, come the dawn and dissolve this nightmare. (Puccini sobbing) (music swells) Is this how you see me and my work? Is it? Oh, they whistle them now. They whistle them now. But they whistled "La Boheme" in a different way the first night it was performed. A straight up-and-down veritable disaster. Crystal clear, a dud! You tell me of the beauty, the peace, the loveliness of this blue lake, this little blue lake surrounded by reeds and peace. An Eden, a paradise! But no one remembers now about the women here in Torre del Lago. (music intensifies) Forgive me. Forgive me, Doria. So long ago. (melancholy opera music) - [Giulio Voiceover] You're both tormenting yourselves over something which doesn't exist. Ah, the treachery Elvira sees doesn't exist because you've never regarded your behavior as any kind of betrayal. Have you? Have you? You have not. Nor is it. Are you working? (footsteps crunching) (door clunks) - I cannot do anything to stop it. She will surely die. - And at the end of that there's a total blackout on everything, including the rock. - Oh, that's not what you said the last time, but that's all right. - Didn't I? I did. - No, Ian. - Didn't I, there. - Well, you keep saying a total blackout and then you say well, no, not a total blackout. But that's all right. I mean, you never know, you might move the set again, which would make it easiest. Well, there's nowhere left for it to go. - [Director] I have already incurred enough dismay by moving it around. Well, I'm sorry to keep banging on about this orange, but I mean the point is that we somehow-- - You haven't mentioned that lately. (laughs) - I can be provoked. The point is to make the room completely different feel, a quality almost to everything that's going on in the city beyond. So that you absolutely all the time have the feeling that they, in the city, are commenting upon what's actually happening inside the room. - Yes, I find it difficult to find a balance between the room being falsely warm, whereas I think that the interior of his house should look naturalistic, why must everything else should look like a nightmare? But I think I'm good on it. - Okay, good. - And if I don't get there, you'll drive me to it, innit? - Certainly, certainly. (laughing) Without a moment's hesitation. That color's absolute magic. What is it? Is it a sort of violet? I mean, that's exactly after all what Puccini says, he wanted the walls of a great violet city. It's always puzzled me as to why it should be violet. Maybe he had bad dreams. - "It is not true. "I make a gift of my love, "secret and unconfessed, "a gift for my Lord. "I am not a whore." (Umberto screams) (screams louder) (somber music) - Hey, Umberto, what's the noise in the village? (Doria screams) - The girl is dying in agony. Our girl. (Doria screams) Listen. You can hear her screaming! - Which girl? - Which girl? - Yes, which girl! - Madam. - With you there are so many! - Madam! Doria, Doria! She took poison! Because she couldn't live if people believed her guilty of the terrible things you said she did. - What terrible things? (exasperated scream) See, I have proof. (Doria screaming) Look, look, look, these sheets. Stained! Well, you're not to deny it! I know, I have proof! (Puccini screams) (Puccini screams) (lighthearted music) - [Director] Suits you (laughs). - Little bit cheeky (laughs). - This is a natural for Dr. Who. - Good evening ladies and gentlemen, this is your five minute call. Five minutes, please. Thank you. (muffled speaking) Beginnings for Act One, please. Locals and Miss Andrew, Miss-- - [Director] Good evening, Madame Puccini. Ken, do you know Puccini's granddaughter? - Of course we were all on top dough waiting for the opera Turandot to be produced and performed. And, oh, we were all so excited. And I remember very clearly Rosa Raisa was the Turandot, the Liu was Maria Zamboni, conducted by Toscanini. And I recall we came to the point where the pen fell from Puccini's hand and I recall that Toscanini put down the baton and turned to the audience and said (speaking Italian). And we all rose to observe a silence. And then I was asked to get the score very quickly. And I was one of the first to sing it. And wherever I sang it for the first time, this was always observed. - Ladies and gentlemen, will you please take your seats as this evening's performance of Turandot will begin in one minute. - You know, I wonder if it was because Puccini was suffering. I don't know, but, oh, I feel so much of him in that music. - House lights and LX cues one to six standing by, please. (triumphant music) - [Puccini] We should go. - You may go. I shall not. Why are you putting the shutters up? They know we're here. - I do it as a mark of respect. - Respect. - Yes. - I know her to be a liar. - The girl left a note saying she was innocent. She would not have lied on her deathbed. - Shall you take me to the railway station? - Yes. - I never want to see you again. Are you my witness? My son, I never want to see this man again. - I thought the love I felt for your mother was unassailable. - Where will you go? - Why? - I must know. - I'll stay here. I have to try to do some work. - I must say it, father. I blame you. - You cannot accuse me! - I do. I'm going. - Where? - I shall go to Munich. - Your studies! - Why? - To get away from both of you. (footsteps thudding) (door thuds) - Elvira. I cannot understand your cruelty! - Can you not? With your world of flopping heroines oozing their love, can you not? You know nothing of steel sharp love. Know nothing of it, want nothing of it. Love, to you, is a cushion. A soft sink back into easement, soft words, soft flesh, soft and enveloping fragrant gardens in which you trowel, most thick, lush, smothering, lied-in. Sordid like a little boy just discovered his thing, you can push it in wherever you like, whenever you like. Protected, hidden, a mouse with sparkling eyes, pomaded hair and elegant whiskers poking, rotting! You know nothing of hard, cruel love, hacked from scorn and derision, shaped into granite heart, implacable, relentless, triumphant love (sobs). (singing in Italian) (waves lapping) - Oh, we do not blame you in the village. We did. But now we do not. Dr. Giacchi examined the child after her death, which is the custom, and found her not to have been with any man. And that is stated in legal terms, which we cannot blame you for. We blame your wife. - No, you shouldn't. - Full blame. We intend to take her to court. We thought at first we would kill her. - Everyone has condemned me. Everyone. But I shall never yield my conviction. I know, without any doubt, that my husband used Doria Manfredi as his mistress. I saw it. I saw his eyes, heard his voice. I knew his thoughts. I knew the way his body leaned. I saw her body given, taken and accepted, become something it wasn't before. There was love, I saw it. I could smell it. What will the world say if you let me, your wife, go to prison? Suggest to me my defense. That I did not wish her death? I did. I wish death to them all. All my husbands' little gardens. I wish them to wither and die and be denied spring. - [Puccini] Tell the truth! Tell the truth, Elvira. Let the newspapers tell the truth that you know that the girl was innocent, as was I. I have always loved you, Elvira. I do still. Much to my amazement, I do. This is the saddest time of my life. - Yes. It must be. (Puccini's "In questa reggia") - [Giacchi] Will not go to prison, surely? - [Fucini] That is the sentence. For five months. - [Umberto] Not enough, not enough. - [Giacchi] Poor girl, wanting nothing more than to marry one day, have children. - [Fucini] Five months and a hefty fine. And still she won't accept the truth. (birds squawking) - Yes. 12,000 lira. I accept. I accept it from you, Signor, Maestro Puccini, because I know already my daughter's name is clear. I shall instruct Signor Fucini. We have done enough, seen enough. Good lawyer. It is all over. There will be no more. But I shall not smile upon your wife again. Nor will my wife. You, I thank. You love your wife. Please! Try to recover yourself. Courage. Courage! - Puccini is bent over with it. 10, 15 years older. She has done it. And yet he loves her. - True love is very rare. Very rare indeed. - Doesn't just happen. It's chemical. - So rare that I can only think of one other person I know. - Subtle change in the blood, perhaps. - In the sight of God, two people are joined. - Apart from myself and my wife. - The change, absolute. - Never to be sundered. (birds squawking) (footsteps crunching) (Puccini's "Tu che di gel sei cinta") - And I particularly like this one. This one no doubt will amuse you. It says "This production was "the most embarrassing experience "in the life of a once intelligent opera company" and that Scottish opera should be, what is it, "Scottish opera "doesn't deserve it." I suppose the man completely forgot to notice that all the 11 performances totally sold out and there was a black market on tickets. There was even a man who paid 100 pounds for a ticket to get in. Right, crazy. And there's another one. They get better and better. This one is a real asshole. He says that I "had taken the biographical method "practicing my wildly overpraised documentaries "and simply put it on the stage. "This production will die." Now that's very like something Puccini himself suffered. Where is it, there's a reference in Mosco Carrer to the first performance. Yes, here it is, where Puccini says "I was lynched. "Those cannibals, the critics, didn't listen "to a single note. "They spat poison at me." The critic in the Corriere della Sera says "Madame Butterfly is a diabetic opera, "the result of an accident. "This opera is dead." Presumably he's the same man who wrote of "La Boheme" when it was first performed that, what was it, "it will leave absolutely no mark "in the history of opera "and will soon be forgotten." Ah, yes, and the Guardian man says "The sooner this production is forgotten, the better." Well, there we are. (Puccini's "Non piangere, Liu") - [Puccini] Do not weep, Doria. A long time ago, I smiled at you, Doria. And for that smile, listen to me, this is what the man who will never smile again wants from your unfailing little heart. Open your eyes, please! My darling. - Don't destroy yourself like this. Get him, carry him away! - Restrain that raging madman! - Puccini, you are mad! (singing in Italian) - Glory awaits you, my son. Don't tread on a human heart that bleeds for you in vain. - Leave me alone! (singing in Italian) - Let's take him away! - That dead girl weighs on my heart like a stone. - Have pity on her! My niece. I implore you. - I am the one who asks for pity. - We are lost. Lost! (singing in Italian) (music swells) - I see her! She calls me! - What you see is illusion! - You who would challenge love? - Do you know what she sees, milord? Do you know it? Emptiness, milord! Emptiness! We are powerless! Our arms hang at our sides because we see what she sees. Her terror is ours also. (Umberto scoffs) (foreboding music) (gentle music)
