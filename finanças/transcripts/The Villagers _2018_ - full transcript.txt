Come on, hurry up! How can you just leave? Ajeossi had seen the photo Soo Yeon tells her that she is Chae Rim. It could be that they mistakenly see people. After all, you can't to a place like this. Tell me, tell me. I am a teacher. No need to pretend to care. Wasting time. I'm not pretending to care. This kind of thing must be investigated first structured. Why are you so impatient? Seonsaeng-nim should continue just a game to catch your doll. It seems to you. I don't know. Eonni, look carefully! He is here using work Chae Rim's name, right? Yes, right? I don't know. If you want to know about Agassi, Lee Seul Eonni knows better. Lee Seul Eonni? Sorry, excuse me first. Ah, yes. Aigoo, this is what I need. We wish you good health. - Byeong Doo. - yes?

These nights are you do not wander around. Hurry home. If not, your parents will be worried. You're not worried about Soo Yeon? Today he also does not attend school. Anu, that ... I'll talk later with the homeroom teacher. Do you think I've never tried it? Adults who are here, no one is willing to listen to me. Until the police don't have any information. Nobody thinks if this is a problem. Who is looking for Soo Yeon? I ... I have a hubae who works as a police officer. I'm trying to talk to him. You just focus on school. Don't interfere with this problem, understand? Don't miss a day. Which way? No, just stop here. I'll take you home. Where is it going? I can go home alone. You just stop here. Anu, just stop here ... Aigoo, watch the door come off! Duh, this is a child ... Adults will not be able to understand. Phone ... damn it! - = Eomma = - - = Where are you? = - - = Eomma = - - = Where are you? = - Aigoo, this is a child. Just leave the items. What is that? That's ... Yoo Jin! Hey! Who is that ***? Yoo Jin! Hey, Yoo Jin! Yoo Jin! Has been troublesome. Judging from the condition, This student has no injuries. I understand what you mean. We will investigate. Ajeossi, wait a minute! It could be those people too has kidnapped my friend. Yes yes. We will also investigate that. Anu, you have to wait until when will it be investigated? Clearly there have been missing reports. But until now there is no information. That ... must go through the procedure first. Do not worry! Just wait. Do not worry! We will contact again after we do an investigation. Be careful. Hey, why is that detective one? His breath smells of alcohol. It works just like carelessly. Aigoo, now is the election period. If it's not a big problem, everything must be investigated secretly. Which is still no big deal? Already using an electric baton to defend against people's attacks. Aigoo, it will definitely be explored later. Do not worry. Besides, I heard from Yoo Jin he said there have been reports missing to the police. Why hasn't it started searching yet? Anu ... that ... The case is still not received. Why is it still not received? If not from a close family, must have a letter of approval from the family nearby is acceptable. Then explain to him. Aigoo, children at their age already used to run away from home. Seonsaeng-nim, let's see what we can do. Do not worry about it. Besides, you are an outsider. It's best not to interfere too much business in this place. - = Han Soo Yeon: living with his grandmother. = - - = Power of Attorney = - Already. Then the police will deploy power to search. Don't worry, Halmeoni. For the sake of Soo Yeon ... you came straight to the residence this dilapidated one. I really thank you. Aigoo, don't be like that. This is the thing I have to do. Soo Yeon since losing his parents, his life is alone. Good thing there are good people like you who is by his side. What a fortune in the midst of misfortune. Anu, what are you doing early in the morning? Here! For you. What is this? Approval letter. Accept the case. Aigoo, Kochi-nim why arrived have to work so hard? What do you mean by 'laboriously', shit? I told you, let us just take care. Ah, basic! This shit, why are you? from yesterday so? Oh, it's not like that. Oh, that's how the police are here in response to a case? Yes, yes, immediately implemented. Do it well! And also he said he worked part time at Yangsoo nightclub. Don't forget to check there. Yes. This is basic people. Fast! Quickly handled! Yes. Election of the chairman of the new board of directors just a few more days. Underachievers please be watched over. Aigoo, not here earlier. Aigoo ... On election day, don't let anyone miss. All staff are required to vote. I think the performance of the teachers arguably pretty good. Yeok Seonsaeng-nim ... You can't just hear one-sided stories from students only. Han Yoo Jin too. He is a transfer from Seoul. The problem is a lot like as well as the students here. His name is Kang Yoo Jin. Ah, I mean Kang Yoo Jin. Also, look at this. This Han Soo Yeon student ... Often absent without any clear reason. And suddenly it came again as if there are no problems. This time it's certain after running away from home he does something that is not commendable. Whatever it is. The child is not going anywhere. But he disappeared after visit a nightclub. So I said he ran away from home. People who go to such places, isn't it clear? - Seonsaeng-nim! - Yeok Seonsaeng, just a moment. Come here a minute! Briefly. Why is it so serious? Yeok Seonsaeng ... You don't think because it's in the village his students were all innocent. Not at all. Oh, still ... Anu ... Last semester there was also a student Who knows what the hell is fled to Seoul to audition to become a singer. In the end after running away from home, until now still not home. Then he also did not report missing to the police? No, that's why ... Don't take care of kids like that. Just a dozen kids are still not yet pay school fees and adm money. That way you can only get it good work performance. - I understand. - Well. Hey! Why do you insist on meeting with the madam? I reported this morning on my hubae the police. Report to the police in this area it's no different than not reporting. Anu, you have experienced an incident like that last night. You are too far off. How do you get hurt? Seonsaeng-nim isn't worrying about me but worry yourself will be hurt, don't you? If Soo Yeon is your daughter, what will you do? Until the police can find it, You're just busy quoting money from children? Anu ... that's not what I meant. I guess when you say "I will take him away", Seonsaeng-nim is different from the others. Seonsaeng-nim, you are quite focused just draining children's money. Hey, this kid's base ... Yoo Jin ... What disturbs your mind? = Oh Hyeongsa-nim, what's the problem again? = [Hyeongsa: Detective] Hey, that appears on the system that is him, right? - Oh, that ... - How should I explain? I warned you not accept cases of missing persons reports. Anu ... He came with a letter of approval. I have no other choice. Hey, shit! = Immediately return to the police station! Understand? = OK, I understand. Wrong indeed. - = ladies toilet = - You kids. Hey shit! Bring your cigarettes and get out! Don't want to leave? I don't smoke! God damn it! Do you have proof? Your nostrils still smoke Here! Here! Where is the cigarette? Cigarettes! Take it to the place people defecate. Basic brash! Where is the cigarette? If I find it, just watch you guys! Do not go anywhere! Sucks. - Cigarettes ... where's the cigarette? - Let's go! Hey! Stand there, don't move! Aigoo, shit! Aigoo ... Hey! Hey shit! Stand there! Aigoo ... Why does this item fall? Aigoo, you impudent. What is this? Yes, Gyogam Seonsaeng-nim? [Gyogam Seonsaeng - deputy headmaster] Are you looking for me? I found the item suspicious in the WC ... Who reported the case to the police is Yeok Seonsaeng-nim? Sorry? I ask again. You report it to the police if any of our students are missing? Just now the police call and ask this. Yes, it's called Han Soo Yeon. Yeok Seonsaeng-nim ... I give you the trust of watching so that children do not act. But don't tell you to make it the problem becomes bigger. Anu, it's already a few chingu days don't go to school. Yeok Seonsaeng-nim! Why do you have to leak the problem internal school outside? And that is no more than a person child who runs away from home. But this is not just a case run away from home. Hey! My position is far above you Yeok Seonsaeng. Because I'm worried, I give you a warning. Do it as instructed. Don't do anything! If there is anything, you have to be able to withstand the consequences. Understood? Okay, see you later. That day you helped me find information about the Academy of Fine Arts ... Thank you, Seonsaeng-nim. Ah yes. thanks. Kim Seonsaeng? Do you want to walk now? Yes. Then it's right to go please help bring it all together. Yes. Aigoo ... Come on, hurry up here!

If you want to go to town, should take the opposite direction. I want to go to the house, take the item for a while. Stop for a moment and then continue again. - = Now on the way headed to the house of the art teacher. = - - = Yoo Jin: Now on the way headed to the house of the art teacher. = - God damn it! Seonsaeng-nim ... That... Is the gift from Soo Yeon huh? Yes. Gift from him. Seonsaeng-nim ... That day Soo Yeon really is no contact you Then that day - Yoo Jin ... We don't talk about problems Soo Yeon again, can I? That day after finishing art class ... Yoo Jin ... You're with Soo Yeon ... Hey, really, Yoo Jin! Get up! Yoo Jin ... Let me see. I hit you not because I hate you. All of this is a misunderstanding. I never did anything against it. Don't look at me with a look eyes like this. No, I did nothing against it. I told you no. Just a misunderstanding! Yoo Jin! God damn it! Yoo Jin! God damn it! Hey Yoo Jin! Hey! You bastard! Bastard! Here you are! Here you are! Hey! Seonsaeng-nim, just a moment! Bastard! Shucks! Yoo Jin! Hey, you psychopath! Become a teacher but instead record the students secretly with a hidden camera? What are you planning after kidnapping her? What will you do, shit! I have been guilty. Please don't report the police. This one retreat. Hey! This is Soo Yeon's cellphone. Why is it in your hands? Don't tell me Soo Yeon already are you woeing? No, not like that. Do not try anything with me! Quickly explain everything! I want to report the police immediately, is that so? No, no. Not. I told you everything. That night I received a call a call from Soo Yeon. That's why I went to pick him up. Soo Yeon, are you okay? Well. Anu ... Seimaeng-nim ... You just walk first. There are people who come to pick me up. Who? Anu ... Do not worry. Walk first. thanks. I dropped Soo Yeon and left. But then I feel uneasy so I'm back again. Soo Yeon! Soo Yeon! Soo Yeon, are you inside? Soo Yeon! So did you find this cellphone? You told me to believe in your nonsense? Really. After that I never see Soo Yeon again. Then why don't you immediately report the police? I'm just an intern teacher not long there. Fear of nothing. This thing Seonsaeng-nim also understands. You kunyuk! I really like it that's why I'm kind to him. This is a problem? You shit! Pure? I think you're insane. They are underage, shit! The person who hurt Yoo Jin last night was you? I had an event yesterday night have a drink with Gyogam Seonsaeng. [Gyogam Seonsaeng - Deputy Principal] I told you about it honestly to you. You can verify directly. After all, shucks like you ...

I reported the police. This is someone ... I think it's not good. One can be suspected of not only one or two points. There is one child missing. Yes, yes, we will investigate one by one. And also the cellphone must be checked to see whose last conversation was with whom. So ... I told you we would investigate one by one. It is enough. You can go home. Ask you to investigate carefully. Don't just talk in the mouth. Yes yes. Goodbye! Parents, please come here a minute. Yes, Banjang-nim? Yes yes. Oh, hurry out. Very disturbing the problem. Kochi-nim!

Try to see! He said he was recording quietly in the ladies' room. Geez! This is a prank for kids, right? I didn't think it turned out ... He is not someone like this. Who is uploading this? What if the school arrives know this incident? I don't care. What I can do, I have to do. At least you have to graduate from high school. Are you sure you won't regret it later? Sure. Aigoo ... You're still young, still don't understand what the world is like. Seonsaeng-nim, I'm an adult. From now on I can only age. We were rather rushed when we recruited. As a result without careful review, we do it directly. What do you mean by this? I'm sorry, Yeok Seonsaeng-nim. Your school development fund Pay, of course, must be returned to you. Plus compensation money and this allocation fee please accept. And we hope that You don't get too discouraged.
