Hello? I can't talk right now, honey. I'm in a meeting. It's going to run late, okay? Bye. King of hearts. I'll bid. - I'm in. - Me, too. When you're hot, you're hot. I'm on a streak. LUNA'S GAME - Four ladies. - Straight. Everyone ante up. What's for dinner? Today we've got migas, or anything you want. So these guys would just slap down a million pesetas and lose it in a second. Then they'd lose another. You'd think they've got money to burn. Raise you 5. Ten. Eva, bring me a gin and tonic? Whisky for me. Who wants migas? I do, with egg. I'll have the same. - I fold. - I'm in. Hello? I'm leaving town. To Berlin. I've got to go, the plane's about to take off. I'll call you. Bye. What's going on here? The same people keep winning. Hanging by a thread all night just to sink at dawn. I'm in. Raise 300. Eva, how about some tortilla? You finished it all. I'm out. Raise you 300. I'm in. 600. 600 plus a million. - I pass. - That's steep. I pass. I'm in. Pass. One million. I'm in. Luna, your call. I'll bid. Your 100,000... and raise you 100,000 more. Let's break the rules. You mean the limit? Exactly. What else have you got to bet? With these cards I'd bet my own mother if I had to. Your mother? What would I do with her? Is it night or day out? A beautiful springtime morning. I've got springtime in my hand. Tito, go get some sleep. I'll take over. Thanks, Charly. Though I sense we're almost finished. - How are you doing? - Fine, fine. Luna! Come on, squirt. Time for breakfast. Thanks, Leo. Can we go on? What else can you bet? I've got a million more than you on the table, 5 more at home, not to mention a Jaguar in the driveway. So watch yourself, kid. You can call me kid, but don't take me for one. How much is the Jaguar worth? How about 2 million? Sure. Why aren't you in school? The teacher's sick. You can do better than that. I can't go. Did they expel you again? I can't believe it! What did you do this time? "Unruly language and blasphemy". God damnit! Forget it. I don't want to hear it. Leo. Juan said he needs the deed. Good hand? He seems sure of himself. My mother did many good deeds. Now it looks like you're about to lose one. Well, what are you offering? This is the deed to my house, valued at 3 million pesetas. I'll give you an I.O.U. for 5 million more to meet your 8 million. I trust these guys will back you up. So that's fine with me. - Go ahead. - I'll raise you 2 million. Excuse me, but are we talking bathroom or living room here? I mean, just in case I have to take a shit. You'll shit when you see my cards. No. You're the one who'll see. I'll bet it all, that's 4 million more. Call. Four kings. Almost. Four aces. How about one month to pay me off? Because that's how long you've got. And there was an inn. Some kings appeared, asked for a room, but there were none. They went separate ways. But along came a group of knights, asked for a room, there was none. They went separate ways. Don't you have homework? No. Luna, don't lie to me. What's the point? I don't like it. - I'd rather be playing. - That's a dead end. Then why do you play? Because it's my job. I wish I were good at something else. Anyway, it's what I'm good at and it's what I chose to do. And how did you know? Come here. Instinct tells you that. You know what instinct is? What your heart tells you to do, not your head. It takes bravery to see with your heart because when it's telling you what to do you must be ready to listen and follow what it says. How can you see with your heart? Close your eyes. Cover it with your hand and listen. I can't hear anything. Sweetheart, because you're still young. But some day you'll need help choosing a path and you'll hear it. Stay here, don't move. Give me a kiss. - This is my house! - Not anymore. - I asked for 2 more weeks. - You said that 6 months ago. I can get the money, I just need time. We've been more than patient. There's no way you can pay it. You owe us this house and 5 million. Let's discuss it tomorrow. I'll go see Cesar. For you there is no tomorrow. What will you do? Kill me? - My daughter's in the next room. - Too bad. Keep your eye on the ace. There it is, follow it. Where's the ace? Tell me where the ace is. Follow the card. Here it is. Don't let it get away. Where's the ace? Where's the ace? Here. Shit, Luna. - Lucky guess. - You wanna bet? A thousand. You're on. Come on. Keep your eye on the ace. Where's the ace? Here. Wrong. But I'll give you one more chance. Okay, 5,000 on the same card. Fine, I'll knock 6,000 off what you owe me. - We can keep playing if you want. - No way. But if you want - You can pay off your debt. - How? Let me give you a kiss. Okay. I said one. What are you doing here? You want to end up in reform school? Keep this up and you'll see. Luna, if you finish your studies you can go to college or get a job. But not if you fail all your courses every year. Not all of them. Right, sorry. All of them except mathematics. If your teacher knew why you're so interested... And stop drinking whisky! Drinking will get you nowhere. You drink, too. Okay, okay, okay. You're a genius, Nano. The other mechanic didn't do anything. He ripped me off and it broke down a month later. I'll see your 200... and I'll raise you another 250. That makes it 750. You know, you look very confident, but I'll bet all I've got. Your 250... and I'll double it. What do you say? Sure. But just to make it fair, I'll throw in another 500. Right. Your 500... - And I'll take you to a movie. - What? Let's see the cards. Straight, king high. Very nice. But those are tens and jacks. I think that I've taught you enough. Like I said, this guy's tough. Congratulations, Reca. See you around. - Fine. - Come on. Pleasure. - Nice meeting you. - Good bye. Who's that? Reca Montero. The best. Hi, Princess. Had dinner yet? I skipped lunch and dinner. But I'm winning. Look, I'd have paid my debt. You can have the kiss back. Come and eat something. But I'm not hungry! - Delicious. - Dessert? A cigarette. I want an ice cream. How can you? After all we've eaten... - Yeah, kid? - A chocolate ice cream. We're out of chocolate. - What about lemon? - Strawberry or vanilla. - Then forget it. - I want one. - Strawberry or vanilla? - A scoop of each. How decisive of you. You always eat like that? Like what? Like a pig. Shit. Are you named after the tavern? Of course. I was born there. My mother was a cook. She went into labour there. The hospital was too far, so she had me in the tavern. But something went wrong and she died right after. I think she's the one who named me Luna. I'm not sure, though. It doesn't matter. And with your father dead you have no other relatives? Leo's the closest I've got. I love him to death and he worries about me. But the studying thing... I just can't handle it. What do you know about your folks? My dad's still in the joint. And my mother... An ice cream, and the bill. We need to close, okay kids? It's on me. - What's your name, sir? - Me? Mr. Tomas. You like gambling, Tomas? - What? - I'll bet you high card two dinners to one. If you win, he pays for two dinners. If I win, it's on the house. And I thought I'd heard them all. 3 to 1, and you can check the deck. It's brand new. Sure. And where's the money? We have plenty. Four to one. Just by picking up a card you pocket three dinners. Shit, that's a lot of money. Okay. Five to one or no deal. Money on the table. After you. Oh, Lord, let it be an ace, let it be an ace... You can't lose! It's the easiest trick. You should have warned me. When I saw you praying... I need at least 100,000 pesetas. Why not a cool million? 100,000 and I can play in the cave. Why do you want to do that? Why do you think? To win. To sit with them you need more than just money. I know, but I'm ready. I know I can beat them. I can even beat Reca Montero. What? You don't believe me? No, sure I do. As stubborn as you are... She's purring like a kitten. Speed up. Here's your cash. Stop here. I'm getting out. - Pera's at nine. - Okay. Hi, Princess. Look what I got you. Wow! How pretty! It's for good luck. But you can never take it off. Fine. I won't, then. Thank you. Here. - Give them a run for their money. - Nano! - Where'd you get it? - I won the lottery. - I'll pay you back, I promise. - Don't promise anything. Maybe today's the day. Yesterday we got killed. What's the ante? 20,000 as usual? Yeah, two million limit. Right, 20,000 ante with a two million limit. Sorry, Luna. You can't stay. - We're about to start. - I'm here to play. Luna... This is serious. I've got money. My money's as good as theirs. - Has anyone got a problem with that? - Are you nuts? - Hang on to that or you'll lose it. - Come on, Charly. Let the kid play. There's no law against it. How about it? I don't know, she's a minor... When you were her age we couldn't pry you from the table. All that matters is she's got cash to lose. Sir, she's got nothing to lose. Have a seat, Luna. You can learn by losing. Thanks, Aniceto. But you're the one who might learn something. All right. But keep me out of this. - What's the ante? - 20,000. Two million limit, for now. There's my fifteen, and another 15 with a cherry on top. And after I win I'm buying. Drop your pants, you haven't got a chance. I'll top your "cherry on top" with another 15 of my own. I'll see your 15. I'll raise you 30, Aniceto. I'm in. - What the hell are you doing? - I'm winning! - I'll kick your ass! - Let me go! You're not my father! You want to end up like him? I won't end up like him. Where'd you get this money? It's mine. Luna, tell me where you got it. It's mine. Don't lie to me! It's mine! No more tavern for you. How's Leo doing? He'll be better when he retires. Any more questions? She's always in such a fucking hurry. Fine, let's play. Your eight... and 10,000 more. Any questions? Just how much I'm going to win. I'll see your ten... and raise you... ...another million. "Think it over", he said... "And then it came to mind... That what he was thinking... Was what Gregoria had designed". What, you never think? Not when I'm losing. I always fold. If you need a second, I can wait. But I'd hate to clean you out. What if you bite the dust? The only dust here is on those cards, from sitting so long. - What about yours? - Come on, Miki. Thanks a lot, but that's like your chances of winning this pot. Too risky for a single hand. You win. Here, Fernando. You're a saint. Thanks, Luna. You attract the good cards. You're leaving? There's no beating you today, Luna. Just one more hour. One game straight up. It's been 4 days. If my girlfriend doesn't dump me, I'll marry her. But you guys went home, you've screwed and slept and changed clothes 20 times. I've been at this table the whole time. I can't keep up with you. I did screw my wife, but I haven't talked to her in 4 days. I'll play if there's four. - I'm cleaned out. - I'll spot you. - Miki, will you stay if Santos does? - No, Luna. You're unbeatable today. I want to pay off Reyes with what I've got. - Another loan shark? - What? You expect me to ask for a bank loan? Not all of us are covered. Ricardo spots me occasionally. But he knows I always pay him back. I'm going to cash this in. - Let's get it wet. - Your place or mine? NANO, SUNDAY 11TH She probably fell asleep, like last time. Or missed the bus... They just gave me my shot, I'm feeling as strong as a bull. - Toni's got it too. - Toni? From the BBC? - He works for the BBC? - Bogota, Barajas, Carabanchel. Visitor for Fernando Moreno. - There's your girl. - Don't keep her waiting. Quit fucking around. - Hi, Princess. - Hi. You smell so good. And your hair's wet. I love that. I barely made it. - You haven't slept, have you? - No. But I will later. I'll sleep better than ever. I'm on one of my best streaks ever. By the way... Here. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I can't wait to get out and to lie next to you in our bed. Yeah. But for how long? Spare me the lecture, will you? We only have once a month. Once a month. That's what I mean. That's right. Nano... When will you quit that shit? What shit? I can quit anytime. Oh, yeah? What are you waiting for? Aren't you tired of this? Of course I am. But it's easier said than done. - Could you change the life you lead? - It's not the same. No, it isn't the same. It's much harder for you to stop. What are you doing? Watch it! - I'm nervous! - How could you rob me? - I always give you food! - I don't even know you. You wouldn't know your own mother! Give me that! I told you! I said I was nervous! You asked for it! Asshole! Relax. My car's over there, I'll take you to a hospital. - No. - No, what? I won't go to a hospital. You're lucky, it's not a deep wound. It'll heal in no time. What's your name? Juan. What's yours? Luna. Why don't you buy one of those window-cleaning things with a long handle? Thanks for your contribution. I'll do it myself. I'm no cleaning lady. Pass me that bucket. I'm doing this just for you. Even my mother, may she rest in peace, never got me to clean. How's Luna? The truth is, she's doing well. She's on a hot streak. But she still insists on playing with Reca Montero. I'm surprised they haven't played each other yet. Why don't you go see her? You can't go on like this forever. If she needs me, she knows where to find me. Yeah, go ahead and wait another 15 years. - Good afternoon. - Hello. Hi, Luna, gorgeous. You're just in time. We're one player short. - Great. See you. - Bye. Hi, Luna. Good to see you. - Can I get some chips? - You've got 500,000 on the table. - I'm paying my bill. - Great. We're here to waste money, not time, gentlemen. - That's right. - Let's go. - Jaime, what'll it be? - A gin and tonic. Hi, Luna. Hi, Charly. 100's and 20's, 20 in the pot. Win or lose, it's having fun that matters. - That's easily said. - Even when you lose. - I'll marry Pipo. - Only if you behave. - I pass. - I'll play the 80, gentlemen. - I'm out. - I'm in. First one coming. - Luna, what can I get you? - Some water and a chocolate. - Get me a Coke. - I'm in. - I'm in. - I fold. Turning cards. - Eva, can I get a drink? - Sure, what? A vodka tonic. - Pair of aces. - King high. The same. Three jacks and aces. Take Miki's and this is for you. 280. - Half makes 140, 80 and 60. - Here, Charly. - I'm tipping big today. - Thanks, Luna. Pepa! I'm in. - I pass. - Pass. - I'll bid. - Bids on the table. - Santos first. - I fold. - I'm in. - Pass. - Turning cards. - Maximum. If it's an eight we go to 28, and if it's clubs, 200 more. To 28. I'm in. 200 more, take it to the store. I'm in. Go. - I'll do it. - Me, too. Bidding. More than 3 million. I'll bet my pot. I'm in. Me, too. Turning cards. Aces full. Four tens. Four tens takes the hand. Four of a kind beats them all. Sorry, I was really busy. It's okay, there's a wait. - Want a drink? - Same as you. Another whisky, please. I wasn't sure you'd come. I'm glad. I wanted to see you again, too. But I didn't know how to find you. - I'm never home. - Couldn't someone else answer the phone? Not at the moment. - It can't be a lack of volunteers. - Well... I'm not easy to live with. Why's that? Probably because life's just a game to me. What are we doing here? You really don't know? I mean in the Ritz. We could have gone to your place. If you saw my place, you'd understand. What's wrong? You don't like it? Yeah, I was always curious to see it from the inside. Then I'll show you some other time. That's not why we came today. It's almost healed. I knew I was in good hands from the start. There's something I need to tell you. I was just granted a transfer I requested 2 years ago. I'm moving to Almeria. I'd longed to leave Madrid and suddenly I realized there was no reason for me to stay. Almeria, sure. It's not so far away. Can I come visit you? Of course. But I don't know if you'd like that. Why wouldn't I? It's not exactly the life you're accustomed to. Minimum security in one month! Even less if I keep up the good work. By the way, I spoke to Santos. He said when you get out to go see him, he's got a job for you. Don't nag me, I know you. Whatever needs to happen will. Take the initiative for once. I did once and look at me. You always wanted your own car repair shop! Right now my hands are tied. When I get out I'll look into it. Let's talk about you. You look beautiful. I'm doing great. I can't stop winning. Charly told me, he keeps me up to date. And what else? What else what? I don't know, you tell me. I told you, I'm doing fine. I'm happy, plenty of money... Everything's great. Luna, it's me, Nano. There's no need to lie to me. Who's lying? Luna's turn. An ace. I'll bid. - Around 800. - Pass. - I'm in for the haul. - Pass. Turning cards. Three aces king high. Minimum. Minimum wins. Pepa, give me 500 against my bill. I never sleep! Am I an insomniac or a coke fiend? Miki, you're only funny when I'm winning. 20 face down. Evita... My wife and kids finally left for Almeria. I'm ecstatic. That makes two of us. Eva, can you bring me a shot? 200 and 500. - I'll bet it all. - I fold. - I'm in. - Turning cards. Three kings. Maximum. I just love the white ones. - Here's your 500. - It's for Javier. - Give me a million. - Okay. Thanks. Start at 350. And the worst was that time I got stuck in an elevator with a Russian guy in the dark. I was terrified. - 900. - I'll see you. - I fold. - I was scared. - Turning cards. - It was horrible. Four eights ten high. I really freaked out. What the hell do we care? Miki, you're the greatest! It's not his winning that gets me, it's all the fun he's having. My mother had fun playing... - One million. - Stop talking, Miki. You're making me dizzy. Wait until you win the hand. Let's wait and see what Javier's got. Always looking for excuses to lose. Here, Javier. Thanks, Miki. Even I can play when the cards are falling my way. Here comes the infantry! - You're chips, Luna. - Thanks. Hello? Hi. Just here playing poker with a bunch of loud-mouth assholes. - Can I get you something? - No. Something to eat? I can go hours without sleep or eating. But not without talking. - Santos. - What? - Good bye, gentlemen. - Good day. - How'd you do? - Same as usual. That ace you got at the end really killed me. Let me enjoy having won for once. Hey, it's time to go. Not a bad night at all, Charly. Two hundred. 100 and 100. - Thanks, Pepa. - Sure. I wish you'd never leave. But I know I can't ask you to stay. Would you quit if you found a better life? I don't know. Maybe. Then I have a week to convince you. I'm already hard! My girlfriend's not coming for another hour. I'm gonna fuck her so hard she won't cheat on me for a month! - Damn whore is so beautiful... - Chema, shut up. What? Am I bothering the little gentleman? Or are you jealous? Sure, since your chick didn't show. - Watch out, she's a hot one. - Chema, don't fuck with me! Who would want to be fucked by a junkie like you? You son of a bitch! We're closed. - Hello, Leo. - Hello. Can I come in? Sure. How are you? Fine. And you? I'm doing all right. Getting by. You want something to drink? A shot. I remember that time I was so mad I thought I'd explode. You were the most stubborn child I've ever seen. To the stubborn. You still live alone? Who would I live with? I don't know. People marry, or have girlfriends, or lovers... But lovers come and go. They don't move in. Well, you know all about that. I can see you're up to date. Of course I am. Look, it's the two of you. When it came to cookies, Nano always beat you. This is amazing. I'd never seen these photos. You were always taking pictures. Poor Nano. He was like my slave. They're well-done. I didn't know you were an artist. I want to see the rest of them. That's my father! And that's you! You're so young! Was this the tavern before? Yeah. We remodeled everything. It was a grocer's. Who's this pretty lady? Your mother. That's my mother? Yes. She was a beautiful woman. And the best person I've ever met. Where were you? I tried calling you all night. Nano's in the infirmiry. Don't worry, it's not serious. - What happened? - He got in a fight. - He was about to get out. - As long as you're here... You want to play? Actually I came to talk to you about Leo... and my mother. In all these years you've never asked. Yesterday Leo showed me an album with photos of my mother. What's odd is that you haven't asked what she was like. I've always hated her. I couldn't stop. I thought she didn't love me, and that she was a coward for leaving us. Your mother was strong, loving and hard-nosed. You were her pride and joy. I see her face in yours. There were lots of photos of her and Leo. Leo had invested everything in the tavern and it was hard at first. - Your mother helped him. - Charly... I remind you I'm a 30-year-old woman. - There must have been more to it. - Luna... Leave it alone. I've been leaving it alone too long. Now I want to know. Charly... Were they in love? When she died, his world fell apart. He hasn't loved anyone like that since. Except you. What happened, Nano? Who cares? What do you mean, "who cares"? Doesn't your life matter to you? Why do you always screw it all up? I don't know what to say anymore, there's no point. Maybe I should just leave you to your heroine. Is that what you want? Good bye, Nano. Luna! I don't want to lose you. Nano, we can't keep acting like kids, pretending everything's fine. Maybe it's all my fault. I feel too guilty about what happens to you. I can't hang around waiting for time to fix everything. Luna, I love you more than anything, I swear. What about your life? You have to love yourself first! You can't go on like this. If you keep insisting on screwing up your life, Nano, you're on your own. - You're a goddess. - Thanks, Charly. - You're beautiful. - Hi, Luna. I wasn't expecting you today. Charly, I'm broke but I want to play. You should rest. Go home, eat, get some sleep. You're not ready - Mentally. - Charly, if I don't sit at a table today I'll go crazy. Then play solitaire, it's relaxing and cheap. Here, take a taxi straight home. - Good afternoon. - Welcome, Reca. - Glad to have you here. - Thank you. Come in, I'll show you around. I hope you like it. Reca, I don't know if you've met Luna. No, I've yet - To have the pleasure. - Luna, - Reca Montero. - You need no introduction. Though in person - You're even prettier than they say. - Thank you. And I play even better as well. It'll be a pleasure to find out. Luna, you got a moment? What is this, Charly? You know I've waited years for this. Luna, relax. Any other day but today. After waiting so long you can't screw it up this way. Luna, trust me. What is this whole obsession, anyway? You've beaten much better. Reca had his day, but now you play circles around him. - When in shape, I mean. - I'm in perfect shape. - I just need money from Ricardo. - He's not coming today. And his partner doesn't go for favors. The real problem is tonight's game starts at 500 and 100. That means I need at least 5 million. And tonight. You'll never come up with it. Hippopotamus! Hey, Miki, what's up? How's everything? Great. Tell him. Isn't it true I got stuck in an elevator? I'm looking for - Reyes. - What do you want from him? A loan. Miki sent me. How much is the loan for? - 5 million for tonight. - Not so fast. You know my interest fee? 10 percent a day. That's right. You know what happens if you miss the deadline? That goes without saying. Turning for 1,105,000. - Ace high. - Full, aces and jacks. Luna wins. Pepa, please. Ramon deals. The tortilla is so important. It united two continents. American potatoes and Spanish eggs. Ante 500, gentlemen. Don't get hot on us, Sergeant. - I'm in. - Me, too. Go. - Pass. - Bet. No. Raise you 200. - Okay. - No. I'm in. - No. - I'm in. Raise you 400. - I'm good. - Me, too. - Go. - I'm in. - Pass. - Bid. I fold. - All I've got. - I'm in. Full, aces and ladies. Reca wins. Here, Charly. It's what I owe you. You're having a good night. I told you I was in shape. Where'd you get the money? That's my business. You seem anxious, in any case. You're playing well, getting good cards... But you need to relax. Really, stay calm and get up in time. It won't kill you to leave the table for once. Thanks, Charly. I can handle it. I've waited a long time for this. - I'll see you. - I'm in. Here we are. I'm good. - In. - I'm in. See you. I'm out. Pass. Look what I've got for you. Minimum. Full, 8's and 9's wins. - See you. - Yeah. One card and I'm there. Me, too. Diamonds. You'd better learn how to play if you want to keep coming. You just shut up and eat. In total, 2,800,000. Reca wins. Eva, can I have a coffee? Double for me. Another 500. 500 more. Full, queens. Full, aces and kings. I'm getting killed. I'm in. See you. - Same. - No. I'll play it all, about 700 and change. - I fold. - 800. Full, kings. Luna wins with a full house. Hello? I'm leaving town. To Berlin. I've got to go, the plane's about to take off. I'll call you. Bye. What's going on here? The same people keep winning. Hanging by a thread all night just to sink at dawn. I'm in. Raise 300. Eva, how about some tortilla? You finished it all. I'm out. Raise you 300. I'm in. 600. 600 plus a million. I pass. That's steep. I pass. I'm in. I pass. One million. I'm in. Luna, your call. I'll bid. Four aces. Straight flush. No more cards, Charly. Ante 25. What will you do? All I can do. Play, win, and pay up. If you lose? That's my problem. It's mine, too. You're in real trouble. What's this? The deed to the tavern. Pay your debt right away. Are you kidding? You know I can't do that. But you don't know everything. Only that your dad was killed over a debt. Yeah, Cesar's thug did it. To be exact, someone who works for him did it. Cesar is still one of the biggest moneylenders around. Gambling, drugs, prostitution... Anything that sells. I've heard enough. Besides, it has nothing to do with me. You owe Reyes money, right? Yeah. Reyes is just a middleman. Cesar owns your debt. How could I? Now you see why I'd do anything to pay off your debt. Yes. But not by losing the tavern. You want to get killed? I won't get killed. I want to fix this myself. I know I can win that money back. I've won many times. I don't care if you win or lose. If you reach the deadline, give him the deed. I'll leave it here. You hold on to it. Luna. Trust me. I can't give you much. They're not high quality. How much? For both... 100,000. I need more. Can I see that? This? I can't sell this. Too bad. It could be worth a lot. This? Let me have a look and make sure. You'd have 2 months to get it back. Out of curiosity... This is white gold. And the stones are diamonds. You could even get up to 400 for it. - 400 thousand? - Yes. Half a million for the whole set, on hold for 2 months. How about it? Just give me your file, that's all I'd need. Yeah, he took it all, the whole set. Yeah, the racquets, the decks, all of it. Hi. Tomorrow morning? Yeah? I owe you one, thanks. Hello, Ricardo. Hey, gorgeous. No game today. The cops just left. Come back tomorrow or the next day. All right, call me. To 25 face down, money up front. - I'm in. - Hello? - No. - Do I open? - I fold. - I'm in. My pot. - 115 for it. - Pass. - I'm in. - Me, too. - Go. - Fine. Santiago. - Cash. - Raise 500,000. - I'm good. - Another 500. - Good afternoon. - Hi, Luna. How are you doing? - Hi, Luna. - Hi. I'm on my own. Hi, Jorge. Hi, Luna. - They're all waiting to play? - And even more who aren't here. - There's casinos for you. - You said it. I'll see if I can find a table. Fine, see you. Five more. I'm out. Fold. I'm in. 5 and 20. Here, Pepe. - Hi, Fran. - Hi. I see they're playing. May I join them? You're always welcome here. I like your style. They've started, but I'll fit you right in. I think you know them all. Sorry, Luna. Felix said no pros at the table. I have to respect him. You know how stars get. Sure. This definitely isn't my day. Come by tomorrow. I'll get you a good table, I promise. Okay. See you tomorrow. Bye, Fran. I'm in. - Not me. - Me, neither. - I'm good. - Pass. I pass, too. - Three of a kind. - With aces. Hi, Charly. - Pass. - Tell Luna I have to talk to her. I'll wait outside. Charly, what is it? Charly. Charly. Leo... He killed himself. Hi. Can I come in? Are things that bad? Worse. Luna... Come live with me. What if you're wrong? I'll risk it. And so should you. Didn't you say life's just a game to you? Maybe I got the wrong game. Whatever happens, you need a change. It might even be the answer. The answer is here. After that, I'd like to go with you. But I can't say when. I'd like to buy you a coffee. Are you allowed? I can arrange it. Give me some cash. And you say I get in trouble... What should I do? What do you think? Pay him. Besides, Leo made that very clear. I can't do it. You can't let yourself get killed. It's not fair to Leo or to me. Relax. I don't want to die, either. Then that's it. Look. What do you see? You're clean. Luna... Believe it or not, I decided to quit. For good. I also spoke to Santos. He said I can work for him when I get out. You just pay that shitbag and we'll work things out later. What matters is I'll have a fixed salary now. We can make love every day... - If we want. - Nano. I should have told you, but... I might leave town after for a while. Maybe forever. Are you serious? You think I'd joke about it? And... I imagine that... you'd be with someone. I should have told you before, but... I wasn't sure. I acted like an asshole all this time and now it happens anyway. It's not your fault. In any case, I mean everything I said. I want to be in control of my life, and... walk the streets like a normal person... free. You're not making this easy. I'm not trying to. You know I love you more than anything. Besides, you'll only change if you want to. Well... That's it. I had to pawn it, but I'll get it back. You didn't buy it, did you? How do you know? You know how much they gave me? It looked so nice in the window... You said it was good luck. Who cares? Believing's all that matters. Bye, Princess. Hi, Luna. You look great. Women are beautiful when they cry. Remember Alex? Hi, Luna. My friend Alex is quite a beautician. He'll tell you what to do to stay pretty. You have such soft skin, pretty eyes, and your mouth... I'd be very careful. Yes, her mouth... I could kiss those lips right off. What the fuck are you doing here? This isn't the right place. I want to see Cesar. Watch the table. Follow me. Cesar. Can we talk a moment? Do you mind? Not at all. Especially for such a pretty girl. Thank you. We're honored that a player like you has decided to join us. I'm here to pay. I'm glad you've recovered financially, but Reyes handles these affairs. - Talk to him. - I don't like middlemen. I prefer face to face. This is the deed to the tavern. - You remember it? - Yes, I do. Then you know what it's worth. It's yours to cover the debt. What does Leo say about this? Leo's dead. But it was all his idea. Well, the papers seem to be in order. So, it's fine with me. Anything else? Nothing else. Then we're even. Poor Leo. Life's so unfair. 30 years struggling to keep a business and I take it away in a second. I'm sorry. I can't do it. I don't understand. I can't give up the tavern. But there's a problem. You just did. Then I'll get it back. How will you do that? Playing you. One hand, on the table. To play you need something to bet. I have something you want, I'm sure of that. What can you offer me? Myself. Let's hear it. Explain yourself. If I lose, I'll play for you for 2 years. In the club or wherever you want. You know I'm offering much more than you are. Ask anyone who's seen me play. You're well-known, no doubt about it. But will you keep your word? Ask me again. In any case, I've got Reyes if things need to be clarified. One hand of five card stud, two down. I'll deal. You're a hot-head, like your father. If I lose, big deal, I don't care. If you lose, you'll have lost 2 years of your life. And for what? The tavern isn't worth it. Your father was better than me, but I got lucky. Players like you always let your emotions take over. Why are you here? Because you gave in to your hate. You could have given Reyes the deed, left and forgotten all about me. But you needed to express all that accumulated hatred and disgust to my face. That's why you're here. You're going to lose. And I'm glad. We'll make a great team. With my head and your talent, I'll make a fortune. Would you turn the card already? Full, tens and kings. Flush. Some other time. I don't think so. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be stopping for 20 minutes. 15 thousand. Shit, Manolo. Here we go. Didn't you get laid last night? I did and I'm going to beat you all. How was your night? I slept wonderfully, thanks. I see your 15 and raise you 30. She's a player. She'll clean us out. You're not cheating, are you? I never cheat. If I did, you'd never know. No prisoners. What about boyfriends? Got one? Yes. He loves me more than anything. Another hand? It'd be my pleasure. For my father
