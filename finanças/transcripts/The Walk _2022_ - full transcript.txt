Hey, I got a message for all you parents out there. Parents! I have the solution for the two and half months of insanity. Send them to camp! Yes. Get rid of those snotty-nosed, screaming children of yours. Play a song already. I do it every year. Overnight camp is a godsend, baby! Kate! Cheryl's here ! -All right, Ma. I'm comin'! -Next year at this time, we'll be shoutin' you and Kate's names at graduation. - I know. Can you believe it? -Believe what? -That we're graduating next year. -Mm. It feels like yesterday I was breastfeedin' you. -Mom, come on. Come on. Don't put that in Cheryl's mind. Why would you say that? -Yeah, too late. -I feel like a high school's been like waiting in this very long line for a roller coaster, and only now are we getting on the ride. And the next year is gonna be the first drop. -Yeah. And we'll be laughing and screaming the whole way down. -Dude. -I bet you girls are. -I know. -I remember my senior year. Bill and I had our first kiss. -Okay. Thank you. Nobody wants to hear about you and Dad's love life. Thank you. Thank you. -I wanted to gag myself, picturing you suckin' on your Mom's tits. -Fucking tell me about it. Hey, good morning, Mister Mclaughlin. -Good mornin' Katie. So are you excited about your last day of school? -Yeah. -How about you, Cheryl? -Yeah, no, I am. I just, you know, I really need a job this summer, so. -Oh, well. Let's see what we can do about that. Now you just come down to the office and I'm sure we can find something for a really ambitious little lady from the neighborhood. -Really? Thank you so much. That'd be great. I'll be there. -Good. That's good. Now, listen now. The best thing about my daily routine is watching you two girls go to school. -Oh. -No, we love our walk to school, really. -Yeah. -You know, we get to see all of our neighbors. -Well, you're great girls. -Your money or your life. -Marty, you dope! -Marty, don't sneak up on the girls like that. -Yes, sir, Mister McLaughlin. -Now, where are your manners, really? -I-I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry. -I may have to talk to your dad. -Yes, sir. -Oh, that's okay? -Uh, I'm--I'm sorry. -All right. -You have a good one, all right? -You too. I'll--we'll see you at the office, huh? -Thank you so much. See you at the office. Yeah, thank you. -All right. -Kate, you couldn't wait for me? -Man, it was gettin' late. We had to leave. -Marty, take that puppy dog look off your face. You caught up to us. - You want my father to kill you? -I'm just holding your hand. What's the big deal? -Oh God, Marty, don't be a prick. Everybody knows Mister Coughlin is overprotective of Kate. Did you ask her to go out with you yet? -No. -Why? Because you are scared to death of him. -I am not. -Yes, you are. -No, I'm not. -Yes, you are. -No, I'm not. -Hi. Good morning, Missis Bunkley. -Good morning, Kate. How's your father and your mom? -Oh, they're fine. They're fine. -Missis Bunkley, you still need me to sweep the steps after school? -Yeah. If I wait on John, it'll never get done. If his father wasn't in prison, maybe he wouldn't be so bad. You kids. go on. Enjoy the day. - All right. Hey, you get some rest, all right? -Yeah. -Good. -Geez, why's she so hard on John? -Really? Man, I think he's an asshole for treating his grandma the way he does. -John's dad is locked up for murder, ain't he? -Yeah. He whacked a dude for Mister McLaughlin. Beat him to death with his bare hands, I heard. -Eww, Marty. Subject change, please. God. -You know this is the last time you're walking to school as a junior. Next time you'll be a senior. -Time flies. I'll see you tonight. -Uh, no. This afternoon. I'll be home right after school. We said we were gonna go visit Mom. -Right. -Thank you. Hi. -Yeah, you got something? -I have nothing. -Hey, hey, Wendy. Last day of school. Listen, offer still stands. I can use someone smart like you to help run the business. You know, do the bookkeeping. Help keep the whores in line. -I'll pass, Bobby. -You sure? It's a lot of money for a kid. All cash. What's the problem? -It's this thing called ethics. Leave that girl alone. -Terrance! -Smart-ass kid like her smart-ass father. -Terrance, come outside! -Bye, Ma. -Hey. -What's the rush? -I'm excited. It's our last day of school. After today, we're going to be seniors. -How did I forget that? -Because you forget everything. -No, I don't. -Yes, you do. -No, I don't. -Terrance, you forget my birthday. -Mm. -To pick your sister up, your homework. -Osh. -Should I keep going? -No. You proved your point. -Stop. Here. -It's huge. -I don't get it. What's wrong with these people? -Who? -Them. They sell drugs. They flaunt their cars and their whores. Look at that guy. That asshole looks like he's about to fall over. High as a kite. And they call us pigs when we lock them up. -Thief! Thief! -Stop the car. Stop the car! -Thief! Goddammit. Come back here. Get him, police! 'Bout time y'all showed up in the neighborhood. -Slow down now, buddy. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -That's teamwork, baby. -I'm sorry. -Yo, yo. -I'm sorry. -Hey. . -I'm sorry. -Everybody, everything's under control. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Ahh! -Just tryin' to do our job. Hey, hey. Yeah. Come on, guys. -We watching you. We watching you. -What the hell is this? -I never steal, I swear. Our baby ain't got nothin' to eat. My wife and I don't know what to do. We ain't got no money. -Go easy. Go easy. -Yo. -Go easy. -Let him go! -You know him? -Yeah, I've seen him around. -How much does he owe you for the baby formula? -Eight-fifty. -Keep the change. -Damn. I guess there are some good white pigs left. -I should arrest your Black ass for that comment. -Yo! -Get the fuck-- get the fuck-- get the fuck out of here before I change my mind. Go feed your baby, and don't say a goddamn word! 'Cause I don't want people thinking I'm a goddamn charity, okay? Get the fuck out of here. -I'da locked that nigga up. -Tell me about it. -Dad! - cartoons, right? -Uh-huh. -But it's different because it-- it's just a group of kids and they solve mysteries and there's monsters but-- -Hey, hey. -Marty, you're talking about Scooby-Doo? -Hey. -Well, I. -My little cousin watches that. -Hey, , you still owe me a quarter. -I'll catch you after class. -Hey. -You have a good summer then. -Kate, you wanna take that math class with me? -Now, let's go with betting. No games with me today. -Yeah. I'm not sure I'll stay. -I'm not tryin' to do nothin'. -What's up, ? Wendy? -Yeah. -You ready? -Yeah. -Come on. I'll take your books? -Okay, yeah, yeah. .racial dominance. Hardly anyone seems neutral about -This is un-fucking-unbelievable. Pat! Patty! Come here! Bastards are going through with it! -What? -They're gonna bus Kate around the city. -Stop your nonsense. -Uh, yeah. These politicians are nothing but fucking hypocrites. They passed the bill to bus the kids in Boston. Not in the suburbs where the rich people live. Just Boston. -Shhhhh. Let me hear what they're saying. And calm down. We knew it was coming. Mother of God. They couldn't wait until she graduated? -It's her fucking senior year, for Christ's sake! And my little girl will have to go to school in all this madness. It's gonna be chaos! It's not fucking right, I tell you. -At least, we have a couple of weeks to prepare her. -Prepare her? Think about it, Patty. It's gonna be hell! Protests. Riots. They fucked us! -Will you stop cursing! Oh, sweet mother of God, they could send her to Roxbury! -Don't say that! Don't you say that. It's too dangerous. They better not send my pumpkin there. I won't let her go. They. look, I get it. We gotta integrate, but this ain't the way to do it. -We are not taking her out of school. -Hey, we could get the hell out of Boston. -Really, love? And go where? To the suburbs, with all the rich snobs? -I don't know. The other kids we're talking about are largely the Black kids who live in Roxbury. -Oh, my god. Hey. Did Marty ask you yet? - No. -No? -Not yet, but he's been like hinting around about it. -Yeah. -Pretty much asking me like what color prom dress I'm gonna wear. -God, he's such a pussy. Just ask it. -Hey. -What? - Guess who's been flirting with me? -Who? John Bunkley. -Oh, my god. Holy shit. Wait, that's why you've been coming by the office. You don't want to see me. You wanna bump into John. -Stop! -Literally. -You're nasty. -I know. -You're disgusting. You're perverted. -You love it. -I kinda do. I thought you didn't like him. -No. I like him. No. It's, like, John's had a hard life, you know? His father locked up, mother off somewhere, high on drugs somewhere. -God, that sucks. -He's got no choice but to be a badass. -Hm. -Did Michael ask you to prom yet? -Yeah. He plans on getting a limo. Are you kidding? -No, I'm serious. -That's so fancy. -I'm like dead serious. I know. Me in a limo? Oh, no. -You know what? My dad's gonna want to patrol us around in his patrol car. Like with the sirens blaring. -Yeah, yeah. -Lights on. -Oh, that's good. -Prom night. -Really? -You and me. -All right, quiet. All eyes over here. In a couple of weeks, the new school year begins. And as we all know, this year isn't gonna be anything like past years. The courts have ordered cross-district busing in the poorest white and Black neighborhoods. -Jesus Christ. Blacks? -You know what? Let's keep our feelings out of this. Remember the oath that we all took. This entire city is angry. So we are on high alert until school opens. Now I need to talk to Officers Coughlin, Riley, Jefferson. The rest of youse, be careful. And remember, be sure to make it home to.? -Our families. -Your families. Let's go. -Everything okay, Cap? -Yeah. You might wanna wipe that smirk off your face. -What the fuck? -You and Riley won't be working together. -Come on. Why, Cap? -Because you, Officer Coughlin, and you, Officer Jefferson, will be reassigned to Southie. Jefferson, you will be on the bus with the kids. Coughlin, you will escort those kids into Southie High. -What? Cap, why? I like it here. -Because higher-ups told me to pick two men that I thought could relate to the poor people that are affected by this whole fiasco. -Why don't they leave good alone? -No offense, Jefferson, but mixing the Black and white kids from the poorest neighborhoods is not a good idea. -No, I get it. All I'm saying is it's going to be tough for everybody. -Cap, my neighbors will turn against me. -Hm. Remember five minutes ago when I said let's keep our feelings out of this? Let's keep our feelings out this. And your new partner Jefferson is right. Huh? This isn't going to be easy. We all know that. But I picked the two of you because, well, Jefferson, you're Black. -He's Black? -Yeah, he's Black. And these kids need somebody that they can identify with. -Mm-hm. -And I picked you, Coughlin, because you're from the neighborhood. And I'm hoping that maybe you can talk some sense into your neighbors off hours. Besides, all these kids, the kids on the bus, they know you from Roxbury. Huh? You got a good rep. -Are you fucking kidding me? I'm fucked. I might as well paint my face black walking with those kids. No offense, Jefferson. -No. None taken. -You come back after your shift and I'll paint your face black for you. Otherwise, you fucking figure it out, because your name's in it. -This busing is gonna rip this city apart. -Hey. Listen, man. We need to integrate, okay? Don't be racist. -Racist! You think I am? -No. Just a regular old Bobby Kennedy. -Racist. -Welcome home. -Feels good to be out of that rathole. Twelve years wasted 'cause of that piece of shit Coughlin. Yeah. What's the verdict on him? -Hm? -What's the verdict on him? -The same. -Are you fucking kidding me? What is it with you and him? -Are you questioning me? -No. Of course not. -Hm. -Dad? -Yeah. -Is that the letter? -Yeah. Sit down, babe. -What's wrong? Roxbury High, right? -Southie. -What am-- what am I going to do? They hate us. -Hey, you're right. They're gonna call you every name possible. And liberal Massachusetts ain't no better than confederate Alabama. But there is nothing that you can't handle. And what have we learned about hate? -That it's like an addictive drug, because people who hate have low self-esteem, and putting others down makes them feel better about themselves. -And what does the Bible teach us about how to deal with those that hate us? -We should pray for them. -Good. And how do we overcome hate? -With love. Dad, I'm scared. -I know. But we're gonna try and be brave, right? -I have the letter. You're going to Southie. -Oh, yes! Oh, my god. Yes. I'm so happy. I can stay. -Kate. it's going to be different with Black kids there. -Mm. Why do niggas have to go to our school anyways? -Kate. Don't use that language in this house. You know better. -Or what? What? Like we're not from Southie where the word isn't thrown around like confetti anyways. -Change that tone. And don't tell me what people are saying in the streets. I worry about my own home. -I know. It's just--it's not fair, you know? The Blacks coming to our school, causing problems. It's just gonna ruin our senior year. -I understand. It's okay to be angry. But don't take it out on others. Calling people names or acting out will make the situation worse. Hm? We have to be good Catholics and love our neighbors as we love ourselves. -Yeah, but they're not our neighbors. That's the problem. I'm gonna call Cheryl. -I don't fucking believe this. Cheryl! Will you get down here? -Dad, what is this? This isn't fair. I'm not going to Roxbury High. I'll be the only white kid in there. -What you want me to do? -I don't know, call somebody. You know people. -If any of those coons put a hand on you so help me God, I'll kill 'em. I'll kill 'em all. -I thought we could pick her school. It's her senior year. -I don't know and I don't give a shit. They keep changing the rules as they go. - Hello? - Hi. Is Cheryl there? Kate. Yes, she's here. - Hello? I'm going to Southie! Cheryl, are you there? Cheryl, you there? - Yeah. They're sending me to Roxbury. - What? Why? What? No, no, no, no. Why? - I don't know. - I know why. Those spearchuckers are ruinin' everything. Oh, we gotta do something. We have to. Okay, I'll call you back then, I guess. - All right. Bye. -Got your back. -Hey. Let me buy you a drink. You're gonna need it. -How you figure? -Oh, you got a surprise coming. -Hey, how you doing? How are you? Hey, I got something for you over here. I think you're gonna love it. All right -All right. My two favorite boys. -Johnny's back. -They let you out. -Yep. Just in time for the fireworks. -Fireworks? -Yeah. You know, I hold no grudge against you for putting me away. I get it, you know. Come on. -You were just doing your job. -Yeah, but she's still missing. -Yeah. Whores go missing every day. -All righty, let's have a toast. Hm? A toast. To Billy and Johnny. As you all know, Johnny's a free man. He was doing 12 years upstate, and he never said one word. That's the Southie way. Slainte! -Slainte. -Slainte. -Hm. And now Billy. Billy helped the authorities to arrest Johnny. -That's all right, that's all right. He's family. And families forgive. May the devil cut the toes off of our foes, for that way we will know them by their limping. -I'll fucking drink to that. -Here. Here. Here. Let's go outside. You don't see the night sky in prison. You know what you do see? Of course you don't. Lookin' through the cell window, you see a striped picture frame of the night sky. -Nobody gives a fuck about the time you spent in prison. They should've buried the fucking keys. -What happened to us, Billy? Huh? We used to run wild through the streets of Southie. Nothing came between us. -You remember Mister Kelley? Well, I knew then that we were nothing alike. -Are you--are you fucking kidding me? All these years and that busted your balls? He owed me 20 bucks. That was a lot of money back then. Come on. Even McLaughlin said I did the right thing. -Fine. -I tell you what, I forgive you for rattin' me out. You forget about Kelly and we can be buddies again. Come on. -Fuck you. Never. -No wonder you became a cop. You couldn't stomach the violence. Yeah, but you know in Southie, we make our own laws. and we protect our own. -Yeah. I guess that rule never applied to little Johnny's mom. -How's Pat? She still a delight to the Irishman's eyes? -Oh, yeah. Keep my wife's name out of your fucking mouth. -Yeah, you always did protect her. Well, I--I bet that she didn't tell you. I was there first. She probably didn't tell you that, huh? -Fuck you. -Fuck you. I don't want Pat. She's yours now. But I have to tell you, my son has a thing for your teenage daughter. And you know how teenage boys can be. -If you or your lowlife son go anywhere near my daughter, I'll fucking kill both of you. You hear me? - Billy Boy. Ah, two bodies. -You hear me? -Yeah. Then you'll see the striped night sky for sure. I don't think you'll fucking like it. -Ah, there you are. You two boys catching up? -Like Cain and Abel. Good, good. Yeah. I'll come to the point. This bussing is no good for the neighborhood. Now you being a man of the law, we thought, you know, maybe, maybe you could use your influence. -Keep me the fuck out of here, phony. I give a fuck about the neighborhood bullshit. -You know what, that gun and badge don't make you better than us? You were born and raised here. Don't you forget it! -All right, let's-- let's keep this nice and civil, shall we? Now, Bill, I was told that you were soft on spades in Roxbury. Now, I didn't believe it. I refuse to believe that you forgot who you are. -I know who I am. And I ain't your errand boy like the old days. -Okay. -And I sure as hell don't want any part of your tribal, murderous bullshit. -You're limpin', Billy. You hear how he talks to you? That arrogant motherfucker! You have to let me make it right. Please let me make it right. -All right. -All right? That cocksucker ratted me the fuck out!! -Calm down. -Let me make it right! -Calm down. You know, your problem is you're too emotional. That's what got you sent away. Ah? There's a time and a place for everything. And right now, it's time to celebrate. Come on, hey? You just got out. Come on! -What's the matter? -Johnny Bunkley is out of prison. -And? That's why you don't want to kiss me? Stop looking at me like that. -Did you go steady with him before me? -Yeah. -Did you? -We had a real committed relationship in junior high when he held my hand. What's gotten into you? You gotta understand. My parents came into this country and threw me into school where I had no friends and spoke maybe ten words of English. I got bullied because I had a funny accent. Johnny was the first kid who was nice to me. But as soon as I found out how bad he was, I ran away. I never mentioned it 'cause it was nothing. Hm? I love you. -Where's Kate? -In her room. I don't like how you're acting. -What's the name of that kid who likes Kate? -Marty? You-Ah, just give me a minute. Kate! Kate! -Yeah? -Get down here, now! -Bill, are you gonna keep me in the dark or let me know what the hell is going on? -Yeah? -Ah, John Bunkley, are you and him in any kind of, you know? - What--what are you talking about? -Answer the question. -No! -Don't play stupid. -No! -Stay away from him. You hear me? I mean it. -Okay. Mom, what's going on? -I don't know. Your dad came home acting strange. -Go to your room. Let me talk to your mother. -Dad, you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine. Are you? Go! Your mom told me the good and bad news. It's tough not having your partner. I had the same issue today. -Really, what happened? -They moved me to Southie. I'll be escorting the Black kids into the school. -Oh my god, it keeps getting worse and worse. You're gonna be with. You're gonna be with me on my senior year at Southie? -Come on. Is it that bad? -Yeah! Yeah, it is! Everything is going wrong. -Look, kid, they forced this bussing thing down our throats. It's not fair, I know. -Yeah, I know. I told Mom that and she got all bent out of shape. -Well, you said a little more than that. -I'm just saying what everybody else has been saying. If I call them Black or nigger, it's not--it's not me. -Hey, hey, hey, hey. Stop, okay? Your mother doesn't allow that language in this house. -Okay, I'm sorry, Dad. But I'm-- -No buts, okay? Don't say that word. Where'd you learn to say things like that? -Um. you and your friends? And practically everybody in the neighborhood. Listen, if I tolerated that word, it was wrong. Okay, I understand you're disappointed but that doesn't give you or me the right to call Black people names, or anyone. -Hm. -Okay? Look at me. Okay? -All I want is a normal senior year. What is wrong with that? -Nothing. If I could do something about it, I would. -Yeah, but we can't. The only thing we can do is keep them from coming to my school. -Don't get sucked up into all the neighborhood nonsense. It's poison. You hear me? I mean it. -Mm. -And why is Johnny talking about you and his son? -That's not what you think. -Huh. What do I think? Huh? You know my thoughts now? You gonna tell me what I think? -Don't get mad. -Do I look mad? I'm perfectly calm. -Yeah, okay. Do you know that, uh, job that Cheryl's got at McLaughlin's office right now? Sometimes I just.I just go there to hang out. -What? You shittin' me, right? Fuck! -Bill, stop cursing. -Pat! Patty, get up here now. How many times have I told you not to hang out with those people? You see them, you say hi and bye. That's it. -What's the matter? -Tell your mother. -What is it, Kate? -She's been hanging around McLaughlin's place. -That explains why she's using that kind of language. -You know what? Both of you are hypocrites. What? You think you're better than them? You're not. I've heard all the stories about you growing up, Dad. So don't tell me about those people. Don't tell me about those people because you are those people! You are! -Watch how you talk to your father. -I have to take a walk, or I'm gonna say somethin' I regret. -I think we all need a moment. You need to think about the company you keep. I hate them. -Cannot believe they are shipping me to Southie. If any of those crackers mess with me, I'm missing them up. -Well, you can't go in there with that kind of attitude. -To hell with that. I don't wanna go to their damn school. I don't. I'm perfect right here. But no, they want a bunch of kids who hate each other to walk hand in hand and sing Kumbaya. Politicians are dumb. -I don't want to go either, my dad's making me. But I'm not gonna go with the attitude of a Black Panther or Malcolm X, but a little Martin Luther King. -Psh. Shut up. And where's King? Dead. Murdered by a cracker. -Don't tell me to shut up! And Malcolm was murdered by a Black man. Now is one murder less serious than the other because of the color of the person who did it? -You're always tryin' to find the good in something bad. but ain't no good in this. I'm messing me up a white boy if they screw with me! That's all. -If you go into that school looking for trouble, you're gonna find it. -It found me. I'm just getting ready for a war. -So. you and Marty. -Me and Marty. -You got nothin', right? I mean, he didn't ask you to go steady or anything? -No. He's too scared. -Oh, okay. Well, from this point on, you're John Bunkley's girl. I'll make sure and tell Marty that. -I'll tell him but I didn't say yes to you yet. Did you think about that? -What, I couldn't hear you. Say it a little louder. -I didn't say yes to you. -Well. -My father's gonna kill us when he finds out. -Hey, don't worry about your father. Okay? He and my old man, they go way back. They'll figure it out. If not, we'll run away and, uh, we'll be the new Bonnie and Clyde. -Bonnie and Clyde. Robbing banks and armored cars. -Can I tell you something? -Tell me something. -You want to know why my old man went to prison? Everybody thinks it's because he killed that coon for Mister McLaughlin, which I guess that is kind of true, but what nobody knows is that the coon my old man killed, he-- -You don't have to tell me this, John. I, um--it's all right. -Just listen to me. I'm gonna tell you. Um, the coon my old man killed, he ran away with my mom. Yeah, the spade used to sell dope for Mister McLaughlin. My old man would collect money from him and my mom would just go with him sometimes. One day, my old man went to collect and the coon and my mom were stoned out of their minds and half naked, just laying there. So my old man lost it and beat that coon to death. And my ma ran away. I'm sorry. I brought you something. I brought, uh. this picture. so you can meet my mom. How I remember her, at least. When my old man told me what happened, he made me promise not to tell anyone. So you're the only one that knows the whole story. -I'm not gonna tell anyone the whole story. -I want you to keep that picture, too. -John, you sure? -Mm-hm. You'll always have my family with you. -Okay. -Hey. -Hi, Marty. What's up? -What's up? Where's Kate? -Ah, she took a walk. -Without you? -Yeah, she'll be right back. Marty, let's talk. Hey. -You know something, don't you? -Why didn't you ask Kate to go out with you? -Why do you think I got this sweat box on? That was my plan today. I was gonna give her my jacket. What's the matter? -Marty, she's going out with John now. -Is she with him now? -Yeah. -They know? -Them? Yeah. -Marty, come on. Where you going? -Going for a walk. -Hey, um, you know what? Just let me talk to him. I don't want to cause any problems or anything. -All right, go ahead. But if he talks any shit, I'm gonna punch him in the face. Hey. -That's all you can say? -No. I could-- I could say more. I just. I don't know what to say. -Well, how about, all the rumors are lies and I want to be with you. -Um. well, I'm sorry, Marty. I can't say that. -Fuck, Kate! What's gotten into you? -Hey, Marty, you better watch ya fucking mouth! -John, stop it! I think you should leave, Marty. -W-why? Because of him? I don't have to go nowhere. I'm not afraid of him. -Shut the fuck up, Marty! -John! John! -John! Stop! -Marty! Marty! That's enough! -Get off me! Ah! -Get off him, John! -John! -John! -Are you okay? Are you okay? Did I hurt you? Are you okay? Are you okay? -It's fine, Marty. Are you okay? It's okay. So breathe. It's okay. Kate, are you all right? -Are you okay? Did I hurt you? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. -John, you can't push her like that. What the hell's wrong with you? -Hey, Coughlin. Usual? -Yeah. -And you, Riley? -Pastrami. When you retiring, Spanelli? No time soon. Still a lot of life in this ticker. -My momma said if a cracker calls me a name, punch him in the face. -I said don't say that. The police will be there to protect you. -Do you hear her? You can't force people to like each other. You got to gradually move 'em along. -Too bad you ain't mayor. -Yeah. That's what I say. -My momma said don't trust the pigs. -I, uh, just want to let you know that we're-- we're gonna do everything in our power to make sure that you get a safe education. -Can I ask you a question? -Go ahead. Why do white people hate us so much? -No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't--I don't hate you. And I know a lot of white people who are like me. I mean, look at Mr. Spanelli. He's nice, right? -Hey, old man. -Old? Watch your mouth, kid. Where you been? -Went to the park. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. I had to beat this motherfucker's ass. -You better have beaten his ass. -I did just like you taught me. -There you go. -Can I ask you something? -Is it about that Coughlin girl? You need some tips? -It's about Ma. -What're you bringing her up for? What, your grandma and me, we didn't do enough for you? -Yeah, but-- -But--fuck the buts you ungrateful little prick! I know what the fuck it is. The Coughlin girl's making you weak. Let me give you some-- hey, let me give you some fucking advice about women. They ain't to be trusted. They're all whores. And your mother, who you're so concerned about, left you for a fucking nigga. Let that sink in. I didn't mean it like that. -Yeah, how'd you mean it? -I was just wondering. You know, I mean, you think she might be dead or something? -Oh, fuck that whore. What you looking at me like that for? What, you think I killed her? -Did you? -Well, if I did, she got what was coming to her. Get the fuck out of my face. Get the fuck out of here! Go back to your whore girlfriend. -Fuck you! -She's just like all the rest. -Fucking piece of shit! -Good luck, you piece of shit. -He's just like you. You gonna clean up this yard or what? -Always with the yard, Ma. When your old man was beating my brains in, where was you? In the yard with them stupid fucking roses. -I couldn't fight your father, so I prayed. - Well, God don't give a shit about your prayers, Ma. Yeah. That much we know. -That's not true. I prayed you got out of the joint early. Well, here you are. I pray for you every day, 'cause you're an evil man. -You're home early. -Yeah. After the other night, I'm giving Mully's a break. Where's Kate? -In her room. -What's her mood? -She came home from the park smiling from ear to ear. -Yeah. You sure she was at the park? -We have to trust her. -Not after the other night. She has to earn that. Thanks. You said she was smiling. About? -I think Marty asked her to the prom and to go steady. She was in a special place. -Did she tell you that? -No. But a mother can tell. -Well, I guess he's better than the Bunkley kid. Yeah. Well, I'm--I'm gonna talk with her. I'm gonna give her my approval. Okay? -All right. What's that for? -For being a great mother and a great wife. Without you, well, I don't know. I'd be a different man. Someone we wouldn't like. Kate? Katie-Kate. Kate? Oh, fuck. Pat! Kate's not here! -What do you mean? She went upstairs. -She better not be where I think she is. You call Cheryl's house. I'll check the park, but so help me God if she's at McLaughlin's place. -Kate. -Hey. -What's the matter? -It's just family problems. Don't worry about it. -Hey. Hey, look who thinks they can drive through Southie. Hey, hey, come here. Come here. Let's throw these fucking rocks. Come here. -Me? -Yeah. Yeah. -Don't look at them. - Throw it. -Ah! Go, go! Daddy, drive! Drive! -Okay, motherfucker. Fuck you! Hey, hey. What a throw! That's my fuckin' girl. Fuck you, bitch! -Are you okay? I'm sorry, babe. -Dad, no. What are you doing? Where are you going? No, no, no, no. No, no, no. Dad, I wanna go back home. -Please. Please, Dad. Don't! No, no, no. I wanna go home. Dad, please stop. No, no, no. No, Dad. Dad, please stop. I wanna go home. I wanna go home. Please. Dad, I wanna go home. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I wanna go home. -Hey. You okay? Your window. What happened to your window? -Look, we don't want no more trouble. -No, I'm--I'm a cop. You need help? You okay? -We're good. -All right, then. Just get that window fixed. -Why didn't you tell him what happened? -You don't know who to trust. Did you see a badge? Times like this, I wish your mama was still around. She had nerves of steel. I don't even know how she did it, you know. Even when she was facing the cancer, she never, never cried once. You know, I cried all the time. And if she saw some injustice, she just, she'd jump right into action, regardless of the danger. I called her on it once or twice and she'd just throw her famous Gandhi quote. She said, "You got to do the right thing. You never know what's gonna be the results. But if you do nothing, there will be no results." -Gandhi never had to drive through Southie. -I've made a decision. Your mama wouldn't approve of it, but I'm not gonna make you go to that school. It's. it's too dangerous. -What the fuck? I thought you left. Go rent a room. Come on. Look what we got here. -Hey, John, come on. You don't bring young ladies up here. Especially not Kate, do you hear me? -Yes, sir. -All right. Good work, kids. -He's certainly your son. -Yeah, he is. Likes a little after school work. -That's what I'm sayin'. I don't know what you-- is--is he qualified? -Yeah. -To fucking do it? -Yeah. Yeah. -Who's--who's this? -McLaughlin, I know you're in there. -All right, man. -You see what I'm talking about? -Kate! -Hold on. I'm fucking coming. -Huh? Kate! Kate! Where is she? Where's my daughter? -She ain't here. -Calm down, Billy. -Ya fuckin' prick. -Calm down. -What do you think we are? A bunch of fucking tree jumpers? Look around! Is this a place for a teenage girl? -Okay, you're right. I apologize. -Yeah, you damn right I'm right. We got a bunch of morals and codes that we don't fucking break. Don't disrespect us like that again. One more time, and like that fucking ball -Ooh. -I just swung at, you won't fucking exist. -Hey, hold on. Hold on. If Kate's missing, maybe we can help. -I don't need your kind of help. -Oh, be nice, Billy. -Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah, sure. Billy, you got a call. -Here we go. -We work for you now apparently. -There you go. - Hello. Yeah. Okay. Kate's home. -Uh, Billy, then. -Billy, don't you ever come in here like that again. - Nice job. -When did you start sneaking out of the house? -Mom, I just wanted to go and hang out-- -Marty? He asked to go steady, didn't he? -Yeah. -Marty. I just. I didn't know how you guys were gonna react. -Yes, I knew it. You know how relieved your Dad is gonna be when he finds out that you're dating Marty? When you came in the house earlier, I knew something special happened in your life. -Really? How? -Your smile, and a mother's intuition. We just know these things. -Yeah. -I told your dad. -Oh. What did he say? -Marty is a good kid. -Kate, you better have an explanation! -Calm down. -Why is everyone telling me to calm down all the time? I'm calm. Where was she? Huh? -She sneaked out to go hang out with Marty. -Is that true? -Yeah. -You weren't with the Bunkley kid? -No!! -You better not be lying! -I'm not-- I'm not lying to you! -Okay. But I don't like the idea of not knowing where you're at. So next time, I don't give a damn who you're with, just let us know. -All right. -Am I clear? -Yeah. Not a problem. Can I go to my room now? -Go ahead. -That girl is gonna drive me to an early grave. -I used to sneak out of the house to meet you. So, what's on the agenda? -Play catch. And have the birds and the bees talk with Dad. -I'll let your mom tell you all about the birds. I'm gonna teach you about the bees. They sting. Get your glove. Nice. Oh, kid. Come on. -Relax. -Tell me about Marty. -What do you mean, tell me about Marty? -Oops, strong arm. Why you like him? Hey. Ball. You gonna answer me? -He reminds me of you. -How you figure? That kid is nothing like me. I think he's a little soft. You know, I'm not-- I was never a soft guy. Which is why I like him for you. You know, guys like that don't have the sting but they still get the honey. You get my drift? What's with that look? -No, you're right. Marty ain't nothing like you. -How was it, workin' the jungle? Hey, new guy. Talkin' to you. -The name is Officer Coughlin. -Okay, Officer Coughlin. Don't bite my head off. We're on the same team here. I was askin', how was workin' in the jungle? -What are you talking about? -Roxbury. You know, land of the. Negroes. -It's like anywhere. It has its ups and downs. -Anyway, we decided not to come in to work on the first day of school. -What about the kids? -What, the spades? Fuck 'em! -That's fucked up. We swore an oath to serve and protect, and you cocksuckers want to back out now that the goin' gets tough? -Hey, you don't fuckin' talk to me like that! You don't know me and I don't think you wanna find out. -Listen to me carefully. My little girl is going to school and I'll be there to protect her or anyone else who needs my assistance, so if you assholes wanna keep your asshole kids at home, that's your choice. I'm a Boston police officer! Don't take another step. -Billy, it's me. Put the gun down. -McLaughlin! What the fuck, man? Why you following me? I coulda blown your brains out. - Look, I knew you wouldn't kill me. I mean, you haven't got it in you. -I came pretty close. What do you want? -Uh, I hear you're not cooperating. It's this busing thing that's driving me crazy. I-I-I can't sleep. I don't know how you can. -Easy. I just close my eyes. Look, you and me, we go way back. I remember you like this. Snot pouring out of your nose, running around in your diapers. We're family. I protect my family no matter what, and I expect you to do the same. Now your fellow officers have asked you to band with them, to protest this injustice, this--this attack on our neighborhood and our way of life. By these people that--they're not like us. They're just not like us. You know, these animals, they're-- they wanna destroy our neighborhood. Don't you get it? Our neighborhood that took generations to build, that's what I'm talking about. It means something. Don't you fucking understand? And what do you say? All you say is what? "Fuck you." I mean, I'm beginning to take it personally. -Take it how you want. You know, there's an old Irish saying: "It's often that a man's mouth breaks his nose." -Is that a threat? -Look, Billy boy. What? You got that all wrong. Threat? No, no, no. No, this is Southie. This is my neighborhood. Don't you make me fucking do this. Please. All right? You and Kate? Stay home. I mean it. Stay home. -What's he talkin' about? -I don't know. -I don't know why you waste your time with him. -He's a fucking rat. You know, I could do it. -Do what? -Take care of business. -Psh. You do what? Just--you can drive. That's it. -Watch it. -Maybe it's time for some of your justice. Make him into the saint that he thinks he is. Ma was real pretty. How come you never brought another woman home? -Why are you, all of sudden, so interested in my personal love life? 'Cause I know you sacrificed your social life for me. But, come on. I'm about to go to college. I think it's time for you to find someone. -Do you really? -Yes. Yes. -Don't worry about me while you off in college. Trust me, I will be fine. I'm gonna grow me a afro, I'm gonna go on Soul Train, and I'm gonna get me a bad girl. -Oh. -Can you imagine if your mama saw me in that? Well, um, I'll come home every week to check on you. That would be really, really nice. -I'll knock first. -Now, that would be wise. - Niggas suck! -Those people hate us. -Yes, they do. That's why I'm glad you ain't going to school tomorrow. I mean, people teaching their kids to hate. Like. like them kids that-- that attacked us the other day. I've never been so angry and felt so powerless to protect you-- -But you did protect me. I'm still here. -No, no, no, no, because my first impulse was to go and attack those kids and make them regret they'd ever picked up a rock in their life. And I almost put you in danger. God knows if you hadn't been there-- -God did know. That's why I was there. I've been thinking. Because those kids attacked us, I think that's why I need to go to school. -Not possible. I-I-I would be so worried about you, girl. -Look, I need to go. -Look. -You're always the one telling me never let anyone make you compromise your principles. If kids like me don't go, those white kids, they'll--they'll never get to know us. There'll be no change, and I need the teachers and my classmates to respect me for me and not for who their parents tell them I am. I have to be brave. Didn't you say that recently? Didn't you want me to go to school? -That was before. Black people have to. be ready to make one choice in America, and that's the choice whether to stay in control when white people are out of control. They're protestors. But if you did what they're doing you would be called a criminal. And you know how they treat Black criminals in this country? I don't want to put you in a situation where you got to make that kind of choice. -But if you believe something is right, you should do it. -Them kids, they rattled me. -Me too. But we can't let them win. -Patty Engel. Patty Coughlin now, sorry. How long's it been? -Not long enough. -Don't be like that. Come on. You were my girl once. Pat. Listen. I protected you when all the other kids made fun of you because you was different. Because you talked funny. -That was a long time ago. -I know. I still feel a spark. -Don't touch me. -The way your husband is acting, you never know. You might be a widow someday. -What's that supposed to mean? -I'm just saying that he's playing with fire. All right? Making a lot of people angry. You never know what could happen. -You're sick. Get help. -Well, listen. If anything happens, I'll always be here for you, all right? Just like before. You can count on me, all right? -McLaughlin insists you and Kate stay home tomorrow. It might be not a bad idea. -I can't, Pat. I got a responsibility. -Just think about it. -I have. I've thought about it a lot. You know, the other day a Black child asked me, "Why do white people hate us?" -And you said? -I said that I didn't hate her. And there are more people like me. Besides that, I mean, I didn't know what to say. -What is it? -Am I a racist? -Of course not! What makes you even think that? -Nah. Jefferson said as much. It made me think, that's all. -You're the sweetest, most honorable man I've ever met. You're a good Catholic. You love people, no matter the color of their skin. -I hope that's true. I hope. I hope that's true. But I think I know what Jefferson meant. You know, I deal with racist people all the time and, you know, I don't say anything. I don't call them on it. So what does that make me? Huh? -Stop. Stop being so critical of yourself. It's not easy. You know, we live on this planet with all kinds of people, some good and some bad. You can't fix them all. All you can do is make sure our daughter turns out like us and not them. -Yeah. Okay. Where you going? -I almost forgot. We have a problem. -What? Where'd you find this? -In Kate's room. -What the fuck? Where'd she get this? -Stop cursing! I don't know. - Kate! Come here, you. Kate? Huh? Where'd you get this? Huh? Answer me. -You know. You know already. -We don't know, so tell us. Now! -John gave it to me. -Why'd I tell you to stay away from that kid? You think I said that to be an asshole? Look at it. - No. -Look at it. Look at it. Look at it very carefully. -Mm-hm. -Look at John's mother's face. What do you see? -She looks. scared. -Yeah, she looks scared. I took that picture. Johnny beat the hell out of Brenda the day before. -You wanna know why? Because she took too long talking to the guy at the grocery store. I had to drag him off of her. -So John is who you're really dating? -For Christ's sake, you've been lying to us. Why? Huh? Why you lying to us? -What's gotten into you? -He's not like his father, and I knew you would never approve of him. I knew you would never approve of him. -Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something about Johnny Bunkley, okay? He's vicious. I believe he killed John's mother. -You never told me that. -Because I had no proof, okay? And some things are not meant to be talked about till crap like this comes up and secrets come out. -Okay, did you ever think of this? Did you ever think that maybe she deserved it for sleeping with a coon? -Don't use that language in my house! And how dare you say anyone deserves to be killed? What have you turned into? -Okay, this has gotten out of hand. She's not going to school tomorrow till I talk to that kid. You hear me? Stay here. Don't you leave this house. -And don't you ever use that word again. -Thank you. Thank you, Mom and Dad, for the best senior year ever. Thank you! -Clean up this mess. -I'm sorry I hit you. But I'm disappointed in your behavior. I love you and I know you're better than this. -Your pin. -Not today. I don't want the kids thinking I'm not on their side. Remember, that one. She's not going to school. -I know. -Hey, I mean it. -Okay. - deserted his heritage. It is his brother, the late president, . -You scared? Me too. I got your back though. Can I tell you something? -Sure. -Look, if I die today. -Stop. You're not gonna die. -Anything is possible with these crackers. I just, you need to know how I feel. -About what? -About you. Wendy, I. I like you. More than a friend. -We talked about this. That can't happen. -Why? We're always together. -Yeah, we're-- we're best friends. Best friends don't think like that. I can't believe you're bringing this up right now. -I-I don't want to die without telling you how I feel. -Stop. You ready? -Fucking cops. . What the fuck is going on here? What the fuck are you doing? Why don't you go back to fucking Roxbury where you fucking belong? Don't fucking touch me! Fuck you! Fuck you! Do it. Do it, motherfucker. You go back to where you fucking came from. Hey, let's get a chant going. Hey, here we go, Southie. Here we go. Here we go, Southie. Here we go! -You haven't touched your food. -It's not right, not letting me go. -How could we trust you? Everything you've told us has been a lie. -I know. I'm really sorry, Mom. But you and Dad would have never approved of John. -Could you blame him? -Can't judge people based on their parents. You can't. -Okay. But to say someone deserves to die, that scares the hell out of me. And to think my child could utter those words. -No, I know. It was a heartless thing to say and I'm really sorry. But, Mom, Daddy isn't even sure. Daddy's not sure that Johnny killed his wife. We don't know. -Kate, are you listening to what you're saying? The fact that we're even discussing this is scary. Shame on you for hanging around people like that. -I know it was wrong to lie to you guys. I know that, and I'm really sorry. But how is keeping me home gonna fix anything? We're just gonna look like the other families, keeping their kids home because the Black kids are gonna be there. It's wrong. Mom, you and Daddy are gonna look like racists when you're not. And Daddy was just really mad and you didn't think of that. -Are you trying to con me? -No, it's the truth. You know it is. Plus, I'm better off. Dad's gonna be there and he's gonna protect me if anything happens. Please, Mom. It's my senior year. So, can I go? Thank you. -Your father is going to be very mad at me. -Love thy neighbor. It sounds simple, but it's the hardest commandment to live by. -I know. Hey, good morning, Mrs. Bunkley. Marty! Marty! -Let me guess. John thinks you should protest. I never thought you would have given up the start of your senior year to be out here. -No, no, no. There's not gonna be a senior year, Marty, okay? The Blacks took that from us. -Kate, you got it wrong. We took that from ourselves. Look around you. You know, you're a different person now. John can have you. -Marty! It's the bus. Hey, hey. Get out of here. Get out of here! -Let me off this bus. I'll fuck those peasants up! I'm not scared of these fuckers! Fuck this, man! Fuck you! Fuck all y'all! Fuck you! -Fuck you! -Go home! This is not the way to handle this! Disperse in the name of the Commonwealth or you'll be arrested. -Just tip it over. Help me push it over! Let's go! Let's do it! -Stay in here. Stay in--don't! Do not go there. Lamont! Lamont! Lamont, what the hell are you doing? You can't go in that crowd! -I told you, my daughter is on the bus. -Listen, let the police do what they're gonna do. They see a Black man and it will make matters worse. -Hey, what the fuck! Oh, thank God. We--we've got a troublemaker back there. -Listen, no one is starting trouble, okay? These kids are scared to death. -No, no. That--that little kid standing there with the-- with the afro. He's been agitating all those people outside. -Screw you. -Fuck your mother. -Hey, sit down. -Clear the way for the students. If you stand in the way, you will be arrested. All right, everybody, listen up. I know you're scared, okay, but we're here to protect you. I want everyone to stay as close to me and Officer Jefferson when you get off the bus, okay? Single file. Am I clear? All right, let's go to school. -I wanna go home. -This is shit, man. Huh? Wendy? Wendy! -Hey! Oh. -Wendy! Wendy! -Wait, wait, wait. Stay behind me. Stay behind. -Wendy! Get the hell off! They're not listening to you. -'Cause they're fuckin' idiots. -Excuse me. Excuse me! -Wendy! Ah! No! No, no! No, that's my dad! -Oh, my god. Baby, you okay? Hey, get somebody over here. -Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! -All right, give me this. Pressure's really, really low. Keep the pressure on. Get him. I need you to look after my little girl. I need you to take care of her. Honey, honey, deep breaths. -More pressure. More pressure. -Deep breaths! -That's my dad! That's my dad! Daddy! Dr. Gale, please call the ER. -How is he? How's my husband? -In the operating room. Okay? All right, he's a fighter. All right? And next time you talk to him, you tell him I'm sorry that I ever doubted him. Okay? Bobby Kennedy can't even walk in his shadow. He'll understand what I mean. It's because of him Bill made it this far. -Is that my husband's blood? -Your husband stepped in front of a bullet meant for my little girl. If he hadn't been there. -Thank you for being there. -You mean school really wasn't that bad? -No. Ma, it was fine. -I don't get it. They wasn't nasty? And then they didn't call you names? -No. They're actually really cool. I sat with a bunch of girls at lunch. We're friends now. -Hm. Will wonders never cease. -I do. Turn up the volume. I want to hear what this asshole has to say. -. to act responsibly and hold the community together . -Hey, what's going on? What are you doing? I. what's going on? What are you doing? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Stand the fuck down. Stand the fuck. What'd you do? What'd you do, man? -Are you okay? I want you to meet the wife of the officer. This is Missis Coughlin. This is my daughter, Wendy. -Hey, nice to meet you. -Thank God you're not hurt. How are you feeling, dear? -Okay, I guess. -And this is their daughter, Kate. Will you look after her for a second? I want to go and talk to the doctor just to ask a question. I'll be right back. -I'm sorry for what happened to your dad. I hope he doesn't die because of you. Don't look at me like that. Am I supposed to be happy if my dad dies a hero? Why did you have to come to Southie? Why couldn't you just stay in Roxbury? -I've seen you before. -What? No, I don't think so. -Yeah, I have. You were throwing rocks at our car. You tried to kill us. You know, if your dad dies, it's not because a Black man shot him. It's because people like you who pulled the trigger. Racist, hateful people-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Mom, I should've listened to you. I'm sorry. I should have listened to you. -It's gonna be okay. -Oh, Dad. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -How is he? -Uh, he's stable. -Can we see him? -Uh, yes, for a few minutes. -Come on. Let's go see him. -Dad, she was one of the kids who was throwing rocks at our car. -I did not see that coming. I mean, with parents like that. I don't even know how to feel. -I'm angry. Like you said, I don't understand-- her parents. I-- -You know, your mother used to talk to the neighborhood hoodlums. And I'd always ask her, "Why do you waste your time talking to them?" And she'd say that a bad act doesn't make a bad person. -Ma was special. -Yeah, she was. And she would be so very, very proud of you today. You put yourself in danger. And I don't ever want you to do that again. But, my god, you reminded me of her so much. You're so brave and I'm very proud of you. -Thanks, Dad. - Bill. If you can hear me, you need to know. You're a good man. You're a very good man.
