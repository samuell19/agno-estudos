Maybe God... Hey Paul, if you throw yourself with the parachute in the universe, where do you go? To come back here? Take an anxiolytic, otherwise you need a shot to forget all that crap you see. A friendly tip? Get out, in the middle of the street, you can't stay here to write an ending. The road is just a piece of sky smashed to the ground. The first one is coming closer... Here, make a wish... He was always the same: everything stopped. I could look into old womenâ€™s bags. Embrace a tree without anyone laughing. Understand what the neighbours, who never greeted us, talked about at night. Put a bottle of cologne into the pockets of the last ones. Everything comes and goes... Birth took us a sad privilege: to make us feel alive. I have problems with the rent, but don't worry, I'll stay for a short time. You're afraid. And granpa? It has been two months since we met. Grandpa... doesn't want to talk to anyone, nor be searched. What do you believe in? I felt ashamed staying in the church at daytime... of the parish priest, of people, of the statues. I liked the church at night. Like now. I used to hide in the confessional for hours, with a torch, and the small sword found in the Easter egg. I used to stand by myself, because by staying alone, you understand many things. I could pick my nose and look... Go in peace... Wherever it is... In our dreams. Even when nobody seems to listen to you in that nightclub, think of the rear window, or of the dishwasher, they listen to you... Cover yourself and eat those with holes, they are the best. One more thing: never forget delicacy... Why don't you show up? When you realize that you really have to die, you start to die. Life is stranger... from 11.30 pm to 4.00 am... Paul, what will we do when we grow up? I want to change everything. So, do you want to be a magician or a pirate? Two and two equal four. It depends. For example, if you take off your jacket, your ring, and you just leave your blouse on, three minus two equals one. If you add the jacket, the ring and a smile, I remember you crossing... 1+1+1=4. Why did you abandon us? When we are with them, we feel alone, when they are not there we are together. I don't want you to see me like that. Remember the elegant grandfather, while he adjusts your collar, it should not be too straight. You are unique... You are sure you've seen everyhthing in the church, but you always miss something. When it gets to "Your Name is sanctified" I think of Santo's smart face. Russian. And I imagine to beat him up. In blood. The whole creation deserves respect. Why keep peolpe guilty and in pain? This ecclesiastical technique is bullshit. Don't talk this way. A church open at night. With a lot of strange people, including me, and I have to listen to the morality. I sing or I don't sleep. Tecnique is weaker in need. You really are a great actor, theatre needs you, and your audience too. Automatic washing-machines chain is extraordinary. I make money without doing anything, then I reinvest into art. Hey, I'm investing into your show. I stand still, but is there "sucker" written on my face? I'm still missing the ending. You've been looking for an ending for more than forty years. I'm talking about the future and you set your mind on a detail? Reality, as it appears, has never thrilled me. I can't understand those who can't tolerate Gin Tonic... They are the same who go to former politicians' events. They are former museum directors, former teenagers. They share same melancholy and they eat expired pretzels. We want to arrive first, they want to arrive last, but with us. Put your house in order, behave yourself and don't recicle the gifts that they'll notice it. Chest out. Put on a fake smile, like a cashmere sweater. Do overtime, but don't take orders, ever! Order the first, the second course, dessert. And be ordinary. Wash your air with conditioner. Stay young. We are the men of hotel rooms, who smell nothing. One life is not enough. Mario, when I drove like a madman and you were in the back seat, did you ever lower your blindfold to look at the road? It's nonsense... Write a surprise one, and don't call me by name that impresses me. While you were driving, I never took it off Do you believe that? You know what he said... Perhaps we are also interested in knowing what he was thinking at that moment. Give up everything, for someone who can't be seen, who doesn't exist. But what does really exist? Now we see like in a mirror, all mixed up; but then, we'll see face to face. She doesn't undersand you. Father, it's useless. She's insane. These are the last ones and then we're really done. There is a line in life where you can no longer go back. And then, who needs dividing lines between beaches? Stop lying to yourself. I'm the producer. You're the nicest person we've seen today. Doesn't he like flesh? He prefers feelings. Strike! Fear is just a wrong station of imagination.. Relativity is a line that goes far, far away, then curves and... The hardest time of the day is when someone wants to be himself right with you. You know, if I think of what's on your mind, I'm a bit better. Yeah, it's just a little better in life. Stop it. Think of those who pack cherries and can't smell them anymore. Or to those who assemble untouchable sports cars. It's a luck, indeed. What? To able to use your fingers to do what you like. One day we'll also make them keep our dick. Then we will manage... to hit the toilet hole. Next one! I forgive an actor all human faults. More light! Again! I forgive to an actor all human faults. More light! When a party ends, I always want... ..to be moved. What would I give for an hour's break. First act. When a man looks at things he loves, they become so tiny that you can put them into a pocket. - Go ahead. - Second act. Everything moves into the pockets until entering inside. Into his bones. Into his blood. Third and last act. The man feels guilty. He's in front of the sea but he can't... Are you still afraid of water? I don't know where he is, Ernesto is back but... Which big lies do you know? At the end of this month I'll give them back with interest. And I never looked at your ass, while you were walking. Paul, we can delay no longer. I got the right roles for you now. You can't just throw away an entire life for a fucking idea. Sometimes I think back to when I was into my mother's belly... when she threw down a glass of Porto and maybe I smelled it, mixed with her parfume. You have to risk to love. And the risk never ends, but even love never ends Courage knocks on our door. For sure... When others rest, on Sundays or at festivities, we do not. They leave their doubts and go away. You stay there... they are still amazed while you do sport or they offer you a piece of cake staring at you, as if it was a miracle that you have teeth... Every day a part of us perishes. We do terrible things, but inside we can fight. When my father touched an object, I always thought it would remain and... my father didn't. - The body of Christ. - Amen - The body of Christ. - Amen - The body of Christ. - Amen - The body of Christ. - Amen The body of Jesus. What do animals think? Santa Claus doesn't exist, ok? But I never dismissed the possibility of him coming. Will it hurt when I die? Maybe What does he, or whomever, dreams of? Does it mention how to forgive? Forgiveness Write it down An ending lasting a lifetime. What is the last name of Jesus? The Irish guitarist asks me this question every night. Think about it twenty centenarians ago he was here.... Thanks One guy lost his gold teeth and I nicked them. Tuesday, I put Silvana, my first love, in the coffin. While everyone was out, I kissed her on her lips. Make me look like a bourgeois. Sometimes I feel like a black hole... away from Planet Earth and it's breathless. Black is a strange color. What has yet to start is infinite... I have always wondered between one novelty and another Novelties are the oldest things existing. People sent each other letters half a century ago, now what? What are we doing? We don't even do the cross sign. Which way you humilate people today? When did you ever miss a sideburn? What do you want to know? My wife in those people's house... She was asked to mop the floor dancing the Alligalli. Alligalli. Alligalli, they are unbearable, almost like cruise tours, where you are told exactly what to do. Once there was a guy in a hotel... I'll finish this one. he threw peanuts at the bellhop and he started playing like a monkey. I learnt the smell of humiliation from Salvatore Esposito when I was twelve. He was called O'fecciajuolo. He lowered into wine barrels to clean them. One Sunday, to make people laugh in the square, they hung him upside down in horse dung, and so my friends and I helped him cleaning up. "Salvatore, we're sorry". "Why?" "For the humiliation". Everyone kept laughing. "Can you see those there?" "I'm a shit, but I don't smell". A watermelon is a seed... which had a chance and played it well. Goodness requires commitment, like believing. False. Like priests. Like this hypocritical and rotten world. It all sucks to me, this I understood, apart from the music. Maybe, the key to every existence... In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. This is why you suck, and you don't hit with the sax. It makes me feel like others. And I never accomplish something. I never get anywhere. Give them back to me, or the other loser will pay for you. "I'd view the peaceful sky, the golden streets, the gardens, down here the distant sea, up there the mount. No mortal tongue can say what in my breast I felt". I get continuous reports. You run this carousel your own way. You make bizarre homilies, on nihilism, the power of individual freedom. You had the choir replaced with street artists. Ah! The listening group says that You made an extravagant 13-year-old girl wear a burka, to familiarize with sense of deprivation. Deprivations generates hopes, but... you need to respect the scriptures, you need to be comfortable. For the Dogon, the cosmos is contained into an egg. It embarasses me. It embarasses me. The House of the Lord can't stay open after dinner. Someone in charge will take action. Do you know why I like diplomats? Democracy will end up devouring us, so... I will eat the diplomats myself. "I"... three letters.. In this case a "D" is missing. I have to make it. I have to make it. I have to make it. The world is so far away. I'm looking for you but I risk to fail, to betray you. I don't want to hear any longer: he wears jeans and steals third-rate jewels. Next war will be for water. I keep coloring distant dogs and if a woman smiles at me while she hangs up the laundry, she is already in love with me, then she closes the window and left me toothless on the moldy wall. It is a real shame not to know billions of people. It is tough behind the bars. What you hoped to forget, remains, and what was to remain disappears. Where does it start? How many questions! You are still young. Where does "far" begins? Since you care so much, I'll tell you my idea: when you wish a chocolate bar, you would eat all the chocolate in the world. That is believing. But when you have a chocolate bar, you can just eat one, maybe two bars. This is reality. People don't have time to love each other. But I do love you, even if you're as heavy as a montain. The ending is still missing, though. The socks now. You understand if someone loves you... by the way they fold your socks. I remember all the dribbles I did as a child. One by one. One by one. But I never wanted to take a penalty. Anything, but never a penalty I didn't want to give satisfaction to the goalkeeper. Because nobody can ever understand us, really. Love is everywhere, in everything. Love is around us, we need to learn to observe, to love. Which is the way? I fight. Show me how to love you... From today on, you will forget the smell of home, that caress on the boat, you will leave the hut and your bow tie. You will forget how white milk is, the chimes of the bell towers, drinking from fountains, you will not give goodnight anymore. Your childish vision of the world will not resist. You will learn to name everything. They threaten you with names. You will think, that it will be enough to hang out with people, to be like them. Scare me! Come closer. When your mother entered the delivery room, I could only take a coffee from the machine. And I don't drink coffee. You didn't want to open them. I'm the first one you saw... We're too tied to symbols, to the chrisms, to an immobile faith. We look for faith even from an orange juice, or from something falling to the ground from the thirty-seventh floor of a skyscraper. We accept a clean faith, as a limousine. We welcome the one that rinses our mouth and it's not just toothpast. Let's put it around our neck, knowing that it's also in the beard we shave at morning, without thinking that we could cut ourselves. Let's share what you have seen, what you have imagined and will imagine. We all grow old, and let him age too. Why doesn't he attack all these assholes and stop the armies? He allows us to make such thoughts. And doesn't he fight human wickedness? Maybe he could be afraid too, couldn't he? A lot happens in dead times. Think about how many mint icicles you ate and I... saw you eating them. You're the best thing I've been able to do in my life. You think you're the only fool who seeks answers. Granpa did not dwell. He didn't tell me things I wanted to hear, and so I imagined them. He could pretend to be happy. A great actor. Estimated and beloved. On new year's Eve, a few minutes before the new year, when everybody was about to celebrate, I saw him leave, from the peephole on the door. We were strangers who knew all about each other. Maybe this is what we could wish for God. But when do you stop hiding and you take this life back? Put on a slim jacket, sourroud youreslf with friends, even fakes, and call it living this shitty living room. You can open a social profile, so you share the joy of making bidet in the morning, you can act as a student of books you never read, go to augmented reality shows, or you can pretend to act as lover of symphonies whose name you don't remember. Scroll through the opinions on world peace, global injustices, share experiences with a robot doll! And then, play tennis, photo! Play the market, photo! Sunday lunches. Unique, as anybody else. Or go around cutting lawns the english way, by bike, by motorbike, by plane, from up there who gives a fuck! Or put something in your nose and retouch dreams that didn't come true, the loved ones who just pissed you off, the children who were never born, the women who didn't love you. Why doesn't water coming out of a bottle come back? Why me it's me and not anyone else? Will I always be the same? Good and evil are behind every door, within every body Alone? You are always with yourself. Take care of the land and respect it. Before falling asleep, think about your life, what you had and to what it will be. Help him. Why don't we speak to each other? What made him excited at my age? The Demoiselles d'Avignon exited him. He never managed to be normal. Normality is a rich people invention. Has he ever killed anyone? When you were three years old, he wanted to smother you. In order not to make you suffer as he suffered. Then, when I arrived, my brother left for heart failure. And then? Then, then... afterwards we hear, without the need for Lexotan, powders. That is the North Can you hear it? The South. Did you think we had a lifetime? You know, I wanted to study astronomy, before hugging you. I wanted to make love, to understand, and I did it, you know that too, but I didn't feel anything. People ask us for a key to get to God. What's in my room? Hardly nothing. As in all clean rooms of those like me. And inside of me? Not being able to celebrate mass. To accept the last ones. The different ones. To listen to all those sins, because one never stops sinning. Let me make the life of a priest. I see violence, hate, perdition. Don't look back. Why do we always miss something? Give us grace and strength. We are with you every moment. Even when we don't know. Save us. Please, let me be a priest. Please, let me be a priest. I'm leaving. I found a new job. Right now? If you don't come back, I'll kill myself. Sometimes... Sometimes you can't. Do you want the ending? Everybody wants the ending. And I give you the ending. From man to man, help me. You don't even get it. You stand there, still. You might as well die. "In truth I say, the one who will turn and become little like this child, will be the biggest one into the kingdom of Heaven". He sent it to me, asking me to give it to you in a few days. Where is he? Where no one would ever think. Please. You say please and you don't realize you're already praying. I am a father who could not talk to his son. But this time is not for my inability. Ernesto wouldn't have been able to see me the way I am now, nor you. You are such and such. I'm trying to figure out how a man learns to die. But you never learn to die. The place that has always distressed me, is the quiteness of the sea, there I could put all the words aside and I thought... to the only thing which never ends, at least for me: numbers. Numbers. During these months I have rewritten the numbers of my whole life. Numbers never end, they stay close one another, you can count them and you'll never stop... 31.536.000 moments in a year. 7 kisses of my father before he died, at that time they only used to kiss on birthdays. 240.900 steps from the house I was born to the big oak. 18 pair of shoes before my first pair of shoes, 23 paper shits a millionaire gave me to sell him the sax. 354 the most beautiful centimeters in the world, the ones on my brother's shoulders. 36.500 clicks of the lock in the room where I sat in the dark and cry. 2 you and Ernesto, the one I loved most in my life. 1 the number of selfishness, of loneliness, of omnipotence, the first time I was afraid of dying, but you never die once... 400 billions stars of the Milky Way. I wish I could seen all up close... 0 your mother's number. She annulled herself. For us. How many times we haven't understood you. I loved you the only possible way. Like a father is not loved. Dad.
