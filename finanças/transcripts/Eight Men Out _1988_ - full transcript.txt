Bucky! Bucky! Bucky! Bucky! I got it, Bucky! I got together two bits. We're in. How'd you get it? Hawkin' papers. Come on! It's starting! -We're goin' to see the Sox! -Come on! -Two bleachers. -Two bleachers. Thank you. Three, please. Safe! -Two bills says he does. -Two bills says he don't. -These are the best seats in the joint. -You bet. If Cicotte's arm holds up, it'll be murder. Better get movin', boys. Commie's pourin' in the clubhouse. Commie, he sure knows the way to a writer's heart. The sportswriters of the world unite. You have nothing to lose but your bar privileges. Quiet. Here comes the Old Roman. Hello, boys. Hi. Everybody happy? Hi, Billy. Tommy. Smitty. Hey, sourpuss. Let's go, Hughie. Ban Johnson's going to be pretty sore if your boys win. No question, if my boys'll win. It's just a matter of how many games it's gonna take. Think it could go the full nine? Nine games? Not a chance. You sound pretty cocky. I got the horses, Smitty. I got the horses. And more than that, I got the team, fellas. Kid Gleason's done a heck of a job at the helm this year bringing these boys together, smoothing out the defense, building up the offense, getting the boys to think and move together. Hell, they eat together, travel together, room together on the road, and when it's time to play they let off steam together. No room for prima donnas in this ball club. Every man for the good of the team. Out. You're out of there. That one wake you up, Collins? Hey, College Boy needs his beauty sleep. What for? He goes to bed at 9:00. Wouldn't hurt you guys to get a little sleep once in a while. Shove it, College Boy. It's like a family, you know. What about the odds on your boys? It's already three to one in their favor. They are underestimating us. Any bet against my Sox this series is a sucker bet. Of course, I'm not a gambling man. -Collins? -Nah. College Boy is the only one on the club gettin' paid what he's worth. Had it in his contract when he got traded. Hey, mister. Hey, mister, you made my brother spill his Cracker Jack. Mister! Here, kid. Shut him up, will you? What about Chick Gandil? He might do business. Chickie's a sport. Gandil? Only first sack in the league doesn't need a glove to play. Hands of steel. I'll put my Joe Jackson up against any player in the circuit. The boy can hit. He can run. He can throw. If he could read, he'd be perfect. Come on, Betsy. A big, big wallop, now. Big wallop. Tell me when, Betsy. She ever talk back to you, Joe? Probably sleeps with it, too. Lay off, you guys. You crackers stick together, huh? Ask her for a triple, Joe. Did you hear me? Been 60 years since the Civil War, Lefty. Ease up. Besides, you guys lost. It was in all the papers. That wouldn't help Jackson none. Just leave him be. What are you lookin' at, busher? Here he comes. Come on, Joe! Nail it! Hey, Professor, read any good books lately? Hey, Professor! Run, Joe! Run! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on, come on, come on! Come on! Bring it here, bring it here. Come on, dig! Dig! Dig! Come on, Joe! Slide! Slide! Safe! Whoopee! Whoopee! Way to go, Joe! Jackson! Hey, Jackson! Can you spell "cat"? Come on, Shoeless Joe, can you spell "cat"? Hey, Mister, can you spell "shit"? Buck Weaver? Bucky's one of the boys. But the thing about Bucky is, he don't like to lose. Everyone's standing up. Here. Come on, Buck. Rip into it. You're out of there! Can't stand to lose. Put him on the "maybe" list. What about Schalk? Not a prayer. Listen, Ray, settle a bet between me and Hap, will you? He says everybody knows how to smile, even you. And I said that your puss would crack if you ever tried. Go piss up a rope. Okay, Eddie! Come on, blow it by him, Eddie. Blow it by him. Here we go, Eddie! Eddie Cicotte has his control back this year. And I think his record speaks for itself. I wouldn't be surprised if he's got two, maybe three good seasons left in that arm. Foul ball! Okay, come on, Eddie. It's just a lot of noise. He's just making a lot of noise. Eddie. Come on. Get it in here, Eddie. Here we go. Here we go, Eddie. Come on. Bring it in. Bring it in. Burn it by him, Eddie. Here we go! Let's get him now. Let's get him. Foul ball! Come on, Knuckles. Don't make me nervous. Keep it down there, keep it down there, Eddie. Hey, rag arm! Rag arm! Hey, old man, get a rocking chair! Okay, Eddie. One more strike. Don't worry about it. You're lucky he's swinging the timber. Come on, Eddie, come on. Pitch it right in there. One more, Eddie. Come on! Okay, let's do it, Eddie. Right by him, right by him, Eddie. Here we go. Right by him, Eddie. Strike three! Fifty years of baseball, he's got the best knuckle ball I've ever seen. If he's such a fan, why doesn't he pay him a living wage? Eddie's gettin' old for this game. I know the feeling. You walk out on a mountain with your arm hanging. You couldn't pitch when you were young, Burnsy. Eddie is the key. We don't get Eddie, we forget about it. Okay, Eddie. Let's finish him off here, now! Way to go! Guy could knock his brains out doing that. What brains? Shoeless Joe is ignorant. Hap Felsch is dumb. Jesus, Hap. Save it, will you? Save it for what? Stay hungry, guys, stay hungry. Oh, whoa. Well, what's the scoop, Harry? Mr. Comiskey sent these down for you. His congratulations for a successful pennant race. Well, that's white of him. He didn't happen to mention when we could expect that bonus he promised us if we took the flag, did he? This is your bonus. Cheap bastard. Fellas, if it was up to me... Kid, we got no beef with you. It's flat. To the Old Roman, Charles Comiskey. -To Commie. -To Commie. Beat their pants off, Commie. -To the Sox. -Yeah. -Hey, Buck. -Come over here, please. Give me three rows, fellas. -Hey, Winslow. -Gentlemen. -Hey, Winslow, your boys look sharp. -Yeah. They're the best I seen yet. Best white folks' team anyways. I say they're the best, Hughie. The best ever. Time will tell, kid. Time will tell. Just relax. Come on, fellas. Pretend it's Commie's wake. Hold it. Now, listen, honey while I say How can you tell me that you've gone away? Don't say that we must part Don't break this achin' heart I've loved you truly all these years Loved you night and day How can you leave me? Don't you see these tears? Now listen while I say After you've gone, and left me cryin' After you've gone, there's no denyin' You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad "Sox sure shot in series." That's the headline. Now want me to skip to the part about you? Start from the beginning. "Now that we've put the Hun in his place, "it is time for Americans to turn the attention "to more pleasurable pastimes." They're sayin' we got no bench, Freddie. That's you they're talkin' about. Hey, if Gleason puts me, I'm gonna put a hole through them Reds. Yeah? You gonna fart at 'em or swing a bat? Hey, wise guy, pow. Hey, Freddie got the best hands in the league. I never once seen him drop a mug of beer once he got his mitts on it. Look at the way he sits in the stool, huh? That's a professional benchwarmer's butt if ever I seen one. I hear you're quite a performer, Mr. Gandil. Yeah, I ain't bad on the diamond, neither. They say you don't even need a glove to catch the ball. Let me see your hands. Look at them mitts, ladies. You should have been a pug, Chickie, mitts like that. Oh, I done some scrappin'. Spiffy-lookin' bird is Sport Sullivan. Anything that moves in Boston, he's got a bet down on it. You think he's beat us to it? Nah. He's just fishin' around for some inside dope, is all. My nose is broke, my eyes are swelled up so bad I can't hardly see, and somehow I bust the guy square with an uppercut. He goes down. Somebody stuffs 50 bucks in my hand. Fifty bucks. I'm steppin' on something, and it's the other guy's teeth. "What's he get?" I said. Referee kneels over the guy and says, "From the look of this jaw, he gets a liquid diet for six weeks." Now what we should have done was waltz around for a few rounds, then one of us hit the canvas, and we split 25 bucks apiece later, and nobody gets hurt. Chickie's smart money. Whenever I'm in town, he's the man I see. You don't play the angles, you're a sap. Say, why don't you ladies go powder your noses for a while? The way I figure it is, that son of a bitch Comiskey's the only one going to make a killing on this series. His ball club, his stadium. His grass, his dirt, his air. In fact, Commie owns you, Buck. I'm surprised he ain't got you all doin' yard work for him in the off-season. -Nobody owns me. -Claude? That's a laugh. Claude? Bein' paged, Lefty. It's time, Claude. You promised. Gleason caught him sneakin' back after curfew one night in Philly, asked him what his wife would think. And he said that's who he'd gone to see. His own wife on the road? Pitiful. Just supposin'? Yes. You need at least two starting pitchers, a couple of infielders, a couple of heavy hitters. I mean, if you really want to be sure. What about the Sox? Six, maybe seven that'd go for it. I'd say you'd need at least $10,000 a piece. Of course, who could put that kind of money together? I could. You go back to Boston and turn 70 grand at the drop of a hat? I find that hard to believe. You say you can find seven men on the best club that ever took the field willing to throw the World Series? I find that hard to believe. You never played for Charlie Comiskey. I see you flirt With some frail skirt And I'm in a purple rage This white-hot passion Been the fashion Since the olden golden days It'd take me four seasons sweatin' it out for Commie to make 10 grand. Now, if we get it in advance, we'll put it down on the Reds. It gets heavy odds, and it starts to multiply. Just a couple games, we're talkin', or the whole series? That's one thing we'd have to work out. Now, the way I figure is... Hey, guys. Damn. Freddie. You oughtn't to creep around like that, pal. You made Chick wet his pants. How about lettin' me in? In what? What are you talkin' about? Whatever you guys got goin'. The fix. You're in, Freddie. What? You want in, Freddie, you're in. Now, if you could leave us alone here, we got some things to iron out. Sure, Swede. Freddie. Keep a lid on it, huh? Sure, Swede. You know me. Listen, I know he's your buddy and all, but... He's in. Swede, hey, he's not even going to play. Chick, he's in. Okay, he's in. What next? Chick Gandil, hey. Long time no see. Bill Burns. Remember me? Oh, yeah. Yeah, right. That's right. Listen, Chick, as long as we're here, there's a couple of things I'd like to pitch to you. He'll chase after almost anything with two strikes on him. I saw him whiff on a curve in the dirt against the Cubs last month. Congratulations, fellas. Hell of a season. Thanks, Hughie. Surprised to see you fellas in a gin mill. It's a celebration. The whole team should be here. Ginger ale, eh? I had some of this once. I think I was six. Maybe seven. Suppose that's what they're drinking over there? Everybody's got their own way of letting off steam, Ring. It's what you do on the field that counts. So if the thing with Sport falls through, then we can try them two birds. Why don't we just deal with them both? That way, it's twice the payoff for the same games. Well, what if they find out about each other? Big deal. What are they gonna do, call a cop? Six or seven guys, $10,000 each? Only one guy has the scratch to back that kind of action. Rothstein? If we can get Rothstein and they get Eddie Cicotte... Eddie. Eddie's the man. Real bad? -No worse than it's been. -You'll get to rest it pretty soon. I'll go three games in the series. You'll do fine. You always do. Every time I throw the fastball, I feel it all the way down my spine. And the knuckler... Well, you don't try to put it where it don't want to go. Some days, it just does what it wants to. You always worry, and you always do fine. Oh, hiya, girls. Your daddy's gonna pitch in the World Series. Hey, Mr. Weaver. Don't you fellas never go home? We saw you play today. Here's your two bits back. I stunk up the joint. No. You'll straighten out before the series. Sure. His name's Bucky. We named him after you on account of you're his favorite. No kiddin'? Shoeless Joe is my favorite. Joe's a heck of a player. Could you show me some tricks? No, it's gettin' kind of late. I got to go. The wife, you know... Please? All right. Get in your third-sacker stance. Sure thing, Mr. Weaver. Buck. Call me Buck. Ready? Bend your knees. Forget it, I make six grand a year. A lot of people are out of work. How old are you, Eddie? How long is the arm gonna hold up? Arm's fine. You got hurt, Commie wouldn't even pay your train fare home. What do you do then? I hear you plan on sendin' those girls of yours to college. Look, Chick, will you just get off my back? Just hear me out, will you? Hey, what's your hurry? I got a meeting with the old man. -Right now? -Five, please. You wouldn't say nothing, would you, Eddie? You said if I won 30 games this year, there'd be a $10,000 bonus. So? I think you owe it to me. Harry, how many games did Mr. Cicotte win for us this year? Twenty-nine, sir. You had Kid bench me for two whole weeks in August. I missed five starts. We had to rest your arm for the series. I would have won at least two of those games. You knew that. I have to keep the best interests of the club in mind, Eddie. I think you owe me that bonus. Twenty-nine is not thirty, Eddie. You will get only the money you deserve. Anything else? No, Mr. Comiskey, that's it. Ten grand. Huh? Before the first game. Cash. What? You heard me. I seen him, Burnsy. Seen him fight once, just before he lost the featherweight title. Held some kid up for three rounds, just so he could to drop the decision. It takes a real artist to dump a fight without hitting the canvas. I told you, Bill, it's the little champ. They don't take nickel bets down here, fellas. Abe Attell, right? You. You were a ballplayer. Bill Burns. Sleepy Bill Burns. Strictly bench material. I won a few games. You lost a few more. And you, my friend, did not get that nose bobbing for apples. I'm a fighter, sort of. Sort of. Let's see. -Philly? -Yeah. Billy Maharg. -You seen me fight? -Yeah, I seen you. You're a bum. -Hey. -Yeah. So what do you two birds want with me? Word is you work for Arnold Rothstein. We got a proposition to make. Could be big money. Well, I'm Mr. Rothstein's ears, so let's hear it. No dice. No dice. You're a practical man, Lefty. You can see the advantages. Claude, who's that? We got Cicotte in the bag already. -The hell you do. -He's in, Lefty. You can ask him. Eddie can dump three games all on his own. The thing is done, Lefty, with or without you. We just didn't want to leave you out of the payday. If you got Eddie, you got me, too. Claude! Claude, who is that? Salesman. Well, whatever he's sellin', we don't want none. Maxie Schwartz and Irish Tommy Flynn. Pretty tough boys. What's the action on them? Both are young and stupid, tryin' to make it the hard way. I'd lay off, I was you. Fight's on the level, huh? Listen, A.R. This series thing, those ham-and-eggers pitched... Not interested. We could see a good hunk of change on it. If it's Burns and Maharg you're worried about, we could just cut them out and do it ourselves. Word gets out Arnold Rothstein's betting against the Sox, what happens to the odds? They drop down the john. But I could bet through these guys. How long do you think they're gonna keep their mouths shut? Twenty minutes? Half-hour? What? Yeah, but they got six guys, maybe seven. Doesn't surprise me. But they're the champs. You were the champ once, Abe. You went down for the bucks. This is different. Look, champ, I know who these guys are. I grew up with guys like that. I was the fat kid they wouldn't let play. "Sit down, fat boy." That's what they'd tell me. "Sit down. Maybe you'll learn something." Well, I learned something, all right. Pretty soon, I owned the game. And those guys I come up with, they come to me now with their hats in their hands. Tell me, champ. All those years of puggin', how much you make? The honest fights or the ones I tanked? Altogether, I must have made 10 times more betting on you than you did sluggin' it out. And I never took a punch. Yeah, but I was champ. Featherweight champion of the world. Yesterday. That was yesterday. No, A.R., you're wrong. I was champ, and can't nothin' take that away. -About this fix thing, maybe if we... -I'm not interested, Abe. I'm gonna go get me some air. I'll see you later. Gramercy 8439. 8-4-3-9. Right. Nat? A.R. Tell your Mr. Sullivan he can stop by tonight. Have him use the servant's entrance. Yeah, he's in, but he wants his name kept out of it. -Mr. Rothstein don't like publicity. -No problem. 'Cause if this gets out, the odds go to shit, the deal's off. Gandil wants $100,000 for the players. That shouldn't be any problem for Arnold Rothstein. No. It's a cinch. Yeah, yeah, I understand, Joey. My heart bleeds. But Mr. Rothstein's been carrying you on this for months now. You ain't come back with a nickel. That's right. I'm collecting for him now. What, you'd rather talk with Monk Eastman? No, no, Joey, I don't expect the whole 40 grand right up front. But listen, Joey, how about 10 or 15 as a gesture of good faith? It makes me happy to hear you say that, Joey. Come in. Mr. Rothstein. Let's hear it. It's the series, Mr. Rothstein. Seems to be a popular topic today. I can get eight men in, including Cicotte. So what do you need me for? Well, I'm a big man in Boston, but Boston's a small town. The kind of cash that I need... A man shouldn't bite off more than he can chew. People watch what you do real close, Mr. Rothstein. If you or one of your people were to bet heavy on the Reds, well... If I lay the action, the odds stay fat. And there's no direct link... Go home. Don't do anything till you hear from me. Yes, sir. Good night, Mr. Rothstein. Big man in Boston. You should have seen his place, Jimmy. The big bankroll. I never seen the like of it outside of a museum. Message from Mr. Rothstein. You, go away. Jimmy, go get me some cigarettes for the trip. Sure. Mr. Rothstein says he's in. Forty grand to the players up front. You hold the other 40 till they blow the series. Tell Cicotte to hit the first batter if the fix is on. Anybody connects Mr. Rothstein with this, I come see you again. You don't want that. You tell Mr. Rothstein he's got my word. I never knew you smoked, Sport. Holy mother. Will you look at it, Jimmy? All spread out like that. -Whose is it? -Who do you think? I want you to take this $20,000 back to Boston. I want you to go over to Mulcahy, you know the password, I want you to put it all down on Cincinnati for the first game. -Tell him it's just a hunch I've got. -Some hunch. Then, I want you to take this to McGinnis. You tell him you're sure I've gone crazy, but I want to place 10 big ones on the Reds for the whole show. -I'm laying bets for Rothstein? -You're laying bets for me. That thieving Jew don't know it, but he's just given me a loan. What's left for the players? Jimmy, you know what you feed a dray horse in the morning -if you want a day's work out of him? -What? Just enough so he knows he's hungry. -Guys. -Hey, Ring. -Hey, boys. -Hughie. Hey, you guys want in on this? No. I hear Gandil deals from the bottom. -Good luck with the Reds, fellas. -Thanks, Ring. -Hey, fellas. -Hi, Ring. -Good luck. Knock 'em dead. -Thanks, Ring. Hi, Eddie. -How's the old soup bone feeling? -Not bad. Hughie's bringing his nest egg down to lay it on you birds for the series. He shouldn't ought to do that. Anything can happen in baseball. Hughie's a lucky man. Hope won't have nothin' to do with it. Eddie? Excuse me, Ring. Come on. It's in the bag. I just wanted to let you and Buck in on the take. In on what take? Well, it sounds like you're already in pretty deep. Come on, Hap. We lose a couple games, we make $20,000. A couple or the whole bit? Hey, whoa, whoa. What are you guys talking about? What about Jackson? The Swede's pitching him right now. He'll come around. If Joe ain't in, I ain't in. So what if they found out that you're dealing double, huh? You cross a guy like Rothstein, they're gonna find you in the gutter with your little toes curled up. Say, fellas. Who's this? Anyone care for a drink? Hey, Joe. Hi. I stare at it till the eye goes blind. Oh. What then? I do the other one. Oh. It's good for my batting eye. Something wrong? Hey, you're the doctor. Listen, Joe, we got together most of the guys. The thing is, we're going to drop a couple of games in the series. -Who? -Everybody. Chick, me, Cicotte, Lefty... -Lefty? -Sure. Lefty and Fred and Hap and Bucky. Everybody. And, Joe, some of them... I won't name names but I had to tell them, "No. "We can't leave Joe out of this. He's one of us." I says... -You want me? -We need you, Joe. I don't know. You'd be an awful sap to turn it down at this point, Joe. Lefty and Eddie? I mean, it would just be stupid not to do it. You don't want to be stupid, do you, Joe? I don't know. People are gonna be awful pissed if you fuck up their plans, Joe. You don't want to piss everybody off, do you, Joe? You don't want me mad at you, do you? Everybody else is in? Everybody we need. Okay. There's a good boy. You won't have to look bad, just ease off a bit. -That's all we want. -Yup. Oh, about the money, at least 10 grand, on top of your regular series pay. Chick's working on it. Hey, Bucky. Welcome to the club. Now, Sport, how about it here? If your fellas come through, Chickie, you'll see the rest of it. -But you gotta show something first. -Now, listen, I told you... Hey, Swede. You're looking fit, boy. -He come through? -Yeah, everything's swell. Listen, Burns and Maharg are in the bar car with this Abe Attell character. They say they got the jack lined up, so go have a couple of pops with them till I'm through with the boys in here. Okay? Sure. Hey, what's with Bucky? No problem. Bucky's one of the boys. -Hughie. -Ring. Did you get it all down? I go to bed last night, it's seven to three on the Sox. Now it's even money. -You're kiddin'. -No, I'm not kiddin'. Some very big money from New York went down on the Reds. -Maybe they know something we don't. -Think Cicotte's arm is sore? Eddie's had a sore arm for 10 years. Something's up. -Hey, Bill. Not a trace of Attell. -Where is that little rat? It's all out on bets. But that's not good enough. Jesus. You'll get it soon enough. -When? -How much? Hundred grand, like I said. 20 after each game. Now, wait a minute. That's five games. I thought we were just gonna dump a few. You lose the first three. Kerr's going in the third. He's not with us. So what? We don't hit for him, he'll fold. He's a busher. After that, we'll play it by ear. We got to make this look good, see? Burns'll bring the money... -I said before the first game, Chick. -...after each game. -Look under your pillow. -Huh? Compliments of Sport Sullivan. When Rothstein fixes something, it stays fixed. Getting the jump on us, Bucky? Oh, hey, Kid. No. It's just all them reporters at the hotel. I couldn't think. I hear some of you fellas got together on the train last night. Pep talk, you know? Something on your mind, Bucky? You don't look so good. Kid, what would you... Forget it. It's just nerves. Nerves is all. Remember all them ground balls I hit you when you first come up? Yeah. -You made a ballplayer out of me. -You were a ballplayer all along. I just took some of the rough edges off, that's all. You miss it, Kid, playing? Every day and every night. Yeah, I don't know what I'd do without it. Better go back and get some sleep. You got to be sharp for them Reds tomorrow. All right. -See you in the morning. -Good night, son. These guys don't look so tough. That's what Custer said when the Indians took the field. Hey. -Today's the day. -A fine day. A beautiful day for it, huh? I heard the same thing, fellas. Every series I've been to there's some rumor about a fix just to shake up the odds. You hang out in bars, you hear a lot of screwy things. Doesn't mean they're not true. My guys would have told me something was up. Sure they would. Give them hell out there. Let's keep separate scorecards. You circle every play that smells fishy. I'll do the same. We'll compare them after the game. Probably nothing to it. Yeah, nothing to it. How's it feel, Joe? -I don't want to play. -What? I don't want to play. And you can tell the boss that, too. You'll play, Jackson! You'll play! I been hearing a lot about odds lately, like this is a racetrack, everybody's a damn handicapper. Sometimes the smart money gets a little too smart for its own good. But I'll tell you, I've been in this game over 30 years, I've never yet seen a club could hold a candle to you fellas. That's the straight dope. The way I figure, we can't be beaten. We can only beat ourselves. You fellas know what I mean. All right, let's get 'em! Excuse me. Weaver flies out to Roush. Sox, no score, first half-inning. Cincinnati coming to bat. Would you like a seat, Mr. Rothstein? I won't be here that long. All right, let's play ball! Let's go, Eddie. Let's go, now. Let's go. Here we go, Eddie. Right in here, blow it by him, Eddie. Strike! Take your base! Rath, hit by a pitched ball, advances to first. Put it in here, Eddie. Let's go. Let's do it, Eddie. Come on. Right in here, Eddie. Throw it by him, Eddie. Okay. Bring it in here, Eddie, bring it in here. Come on, Eddie. Back! Back! Way to go, Happy. -What the hell's he doin'? -No one wants to look bad. Eddie's going to have to do it all by himself. Safe! Off the bag! Come on, guys, that should have been two! One out. Swede! Swede! Risberg, you moron, what are you doing? You had him! Come on, Eddie. Cut him down! -You okay? -Give me the ball. -Take it easy. -Give me the ball. Come on, Eddie! Keep it down! Cut! Cut! Cut! Eddie, he's the goddamn pitcher! Get a pitcher in there. Guess it's not your day, Eddie. Guess not. Gandil grounds out to second base. Final out. Red Legs 9, White Sox 1. So what's the story, Buck? -What does it look like? -It looked like you skunked out on us. Look, I haven't taken a nickel. I don't owe anybody a damn thing. We let you in on the meetings. Look, you just play your ball game, and I'll play mine, and we'll see how it comes out. Come on in. -Ring. -Hi, Eddie. Have a seat. Thought Cincy was a dry town. Laws were made to be broken. Catch. What's this? It's a new ball they're thinking of using next year. It's wound tighter. This thing will take off like a rabbit. Word is they'll outlaw the spitter next year and your shine ball. Things will be tough for pitchers. Things are always tough for pitchers. You really took a shelling out there today. They got their raps in. That one Reuther caught hold of looked like you tossed it in underhand. Didn't break. You didn't put anything on it. Why should it break? Did you bring me up here to tell me I had a lousy day? I want to know if the series is on the level, Eddie. What if I told you we're doing our best? I'll believe you. We played like a bunch of bushers today, but nobody's in the bag. Don't be sore at me for asking, okay? No. We're just dumb ballplayers. We need a mug like you to keep us honest. Yeah. It's me, Joe. I got something for you, Joe. On the dresser. Swede said he'd appreciate it if you'd ease up a little on the field. You looked awful good out there today. Hey, come on, Lefty. Let's groove one. Let's get this guy. Ball! Just stick it where I put the glove, will you? Get a hit! Come on, Claude, let's go. Get it in here. Safe! Time! -I called for a curve ball. -That's what I threw. Looked pretty straight to me. Two outs! Let's go. Go ahead. -Safe! -Curve ball, damn it! You guys stink! You stink! Okay, let's go, Lefty, come on! Bring it in here. Let's go! Let's go! Okay, come on, Lefty. Hum, babe. Hum, babe! Out! All right, Bucky! You guys see that? Way to go, Buck! -Nice grab. -Yeah. -Go back to Chicago! -Go back! You got shit for brains! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Go! Go! Safe! All right, fellas. Come on! Come on! Ask it if it can pitch. Williams, you son of a bitch! -What's the matter with you guys? -You son of a bitch! He wouldn't throw his goddamn curve ball! -What's this, Williams? What's this? -Hey, how about it, Lefty? There he is. Hey, Kid! How about a few quotables, Kid? We have nothing to say. -Hey, come on. Don't be a sore loser. -I got nothin' to say! Get off my back! What's the scoop, Buck? Print what you want, Smitty. You have a good day, Gandil? Not bad. Did you? I know what you're doing, you son of a bitch! I know what you're doing! Let go of me! -Gandil! Gandil! -Come on, Kid! Let's go! Hey, Gleason! Comiskey! We got one of your stiffs down here! -Mr. Comiskey? -Who is it? Gleason. I got to talk to you. This better be important. If I'm being robbed of my World Series, he damn well better do something about it. -What do you two birds want? -We need the rest of the players' cut. It's all out on bets. -What's this? -You heard me. I made an agreement with those guys. Well, that's your problem, ain't it? You little prick. Hey. A couple of Boy Scouts here, they made a deal. The players are in now. Get it? We got 'em by the short ones. What are they gonna do, call a cop? Here. Ten grand. That's all of it. That's the end. -Here, you give it to 'em. -No, Burnsy, not me. Come on, Billy. It stinks in here. Tell them bums to make it look good tomorrow. 2:00 in the morning. He's president of the league, he has to do something. He isn't even talking to you, Commie. He's got to talk to me. -What do you want? -I just talked to Gleason. He thinks Williams threw it all. Now, you saw the game... All I saw is that your boys... -Sure thing, Sport. -They lost it fair and square. I'm being robbed, and you're going to do something about it! That's the whelp of a beaten cur. Commie. How you doin', Kid? -Did you get it down? -Every penny. It's six to five for the Reds, though. Even those Chicago bums don't think Kerr will win. How's it feel, Dickey? My arm's great. It's my knees. -Just another ball game. -Sure. Just pitch 'em one at a time, son. I remember the time I threw a clean slate at the Cleveland Club. You beat Cy Young one to nothing. Hughie Jennings hit a homer in the ninth. My grandfather took me. First big-league game I ever went to. Kid Gleason beat the Indians with a no-hitter. No kiddin'. You're having a hell of a series, Buck. What's that supposed to mean? Nothin'. Just keep it up is all. Well, why wouldn't I? You'd know the answer to that better than I would, Buck. Take your base. Run, damn it. You're out. What the hell was that? I could've beaten that throw out with my shoes tied together. He'll never get work as an actor. What's going on? Okay, Dickey, this is it, this is it, baby. You got 'em. Here we go. Here we go, Dickey. Here we go. Let's go. Let's do it, Dickey. Here we go, Dickey. Here we go. Strike. Strike. You're out. All right, Dickey! That-a way! Attaboy, Dickey! Slide! You got it! Safe! Strike! Strike! You're out! Three! You're out! Nice going, buddy! That's the way! All right, Dickey! Bill? Yeah? Think you can stake me the train fare back to Philly? Yeah, hello, Joey. I hate to bother you, Joey, but it's about that 20 grand you still owe Mr. Rothstein. You gonna come up with it? What? Well, if it's all cleared between you two, I'm delighted to hear it. Listen, Joey, since you're sitting pretty over there, I could use a couple of grand over... What do you mean, "It's all out on bets"? Kerr had the day of his life, but if it wasn't five out of nine this year, they'd be cooked. We'll have to see what Eddie Cicotte shows them tomorrow. Yeah, Eddie's the ticket. Oh, so that's where you went. Keep you up last night? Don't make any difference. You're the one needs the sleep. You shouldn't worry so much. You're gonna wallop 'em today. You got the home field, the whole city there backin' you up. If I tell you somethin', you swear you'll never tell a soul? What is it? Some of the guys ain't playin' on the level. Nah. Chick, Swede, Lefty, Eddie Cicotte. Some of the others. It's hard for me to tell. -Eddie? -Eddie. -They wanted me in on it, too. -What did you tell them? I told them to take a hike, but now I go out there on the field, you know, I make the plays, but I don't feel right. Isn't there somebody you can tell? Kid knows. He's got to, except I figure he's like me. He's waitin' for the boys to straighten up in time to take the series. The dugout is like... Nobody can look each other in the eye. You go out on the field, and you don't know who's tryin'. You don't know who's not. I wish I didn't know. Yeah, me, neither. Come on, Eddie. Let's get 'em now. Let's get 'em. Throw it by him, Eddie. Eddie! Eddie! Cicotte, what was that? You look like a busher. Come on, Knuckles. Keep it down. Come on, Eddie. Let's go. Let's get it in here. Joe, four! Joe, four! Let it go! Let it go! Eddie, what are you doing? How can you make a play like that? What did you cut it off for, Eddie? You lied to me, Eddie. Don't worry, Commie. The boys will be right tomorrow. Safe. Now it's Felsch. You got it, Hap. Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Safe. Safe? You cockeyed son of a bitch! I had him! Who's payin' you? Take a walk, Ray. That's the worst call I've ever seen! I've been in this league for seven years! You heard me, Ray. Out of the ballgame. They're all yours, Kid. Get it! Throw it! Hey, Buck. Hi, fellas. -Hey, guys, look, it's Buck Weaver. -Hey, Buck. Tough breaks today. -Yeah, I couldn't get the wood on the ball. -No kiddin'. My old man says you guys just give up. He says the Sox just lay down for the Reds. -Your old man don't know beans. -Says who? Hey, hey. Hey, ease up. Hey, hey, ease up. Come on. Thanks for stickin' up for us. A guy's got to stick up for his friends. Even when they play like a bunch of stiffs? Yeah. Especially then. A guy don't stick up for his friends, well, there ain't much to say for him. Right, Buck? I'm forever blowing ballgames Pretty ballgames in the air I come from Chi I hardly try Just go to bat and fade and die Fortune's coming my way That's why I don't care I'm forever blowing ballgames And the gamblers treat us fair A crackpot. All right! Way to go, Joey! Quiet. Quiet. Kerr must have got out of ninth okay. They say it's tied, going into extra innings. Wait a minute. Way to go, Chick! Play ball! Come on, Chickie baby, you got to do somethin' here now, Chick. Come on, Chick. Come on, Chick. Show me somethin'. Oh, shit. It's open. Hey, Eddie. -How's it goin'? -Okay. Still no word from Chick about the money. I don't care about the money. Yeah. Peculiar way to find that out, isn't it? What are you gonna do out there tomorrow, Eddie? I don't know yet. I thought that you were supposed to be in charge of this thing. What happened to Sullivan? He switched hotels. We can't seem to track him down. And what happened to Attell? He says he shot his wad in the third game when Kerr won. He says he's busted. -Well, the hell with them, then. -You two made an agreement. Hey, we lose one more game and it's over. We dumped four games. I only been paid for one. You don't know what these guys are like. Once you're in, you're in for good. You can't welch on these guys. It's your funeral, assholes. Problems? Nah. We still got Eddie. Put it away, Eddie. I'm going with Wilkerson today. Why? You haven't had the stuff lately, have you? But I feel right today. I can't take any chances. I'm sorry. Like I can't lose, that's how right I feel. Sure you do, Eddie. Kid? I can't miss. Watch him. It's your move, Eddie. Okay, let's see that knuckle. You're a bum, Eddie! Eddie, go home! How long you think he'll go before he dumps it? Play ball. Okay, Eddie baby, this is it. It's up to you, Eddie baby. Let's go! Let's go! Let's get this guy, Eddie! Strike. Forget it, Morey. Strike. Strike three. You're out of there! You're out. You're out. -One more! -One more! Okay, Hap! That's the way! Strike! Strike! Strike! Two more men, huh? Yeah, go. That's a beauty. Come on, Eddie. Bring it on in there. You got the power, baby. You got the fire. Yeah! Another one! Come on, Eddie! One more batter! Throw him the shine ball, then blow it right by him. Okay, Eddie baby, this is it. It's up to you, Eddie baby! Let's get this guy, Eddie! Go, Eddie, you got the fire! Strike two. Did you see that pitch? Okay, one more, Eddie! One more, Eddie! Let's go! Let's get him! Get him, Eddie! Get him, Eddie! You got him. Come on, bring it in here, Eddie. Bring it in here! Here we go, Eddie! You're out! Good one, Eddie! And I figured I had to stay with my blue chip ballplayers. You have faith in your fellas, they come around. The Reds only need one more game to take the series. -That's do or die for your club. -No sweat. What makes you so confident, Kid? I think the boys are back in their form. They got a look at Moran's staff now, and they'll be swingin' free from this point on. I tell you, class always comes through in the clinches. Eddie came to me this morning. He says, "Kid..." He says, "I can't miss." We got Lefty Williams hurlin' for us tomorrow. One of the finest pitchers I ever seen. Still for a big game, Lefty. How do you explain the way your boys laid down in the other games? What do you mean, "laid down"? Well, they didn't seem too enthusiastic about their jobs. Nobody did any layin' down. Might have been a little overconfident, maybe we didn't have the fine edge, but the boys have been puttin' out. The boys been put out more than they been puttin' out. You really think you can turn this series around, Kid? No sweat. -The odds are pretty steep. -My boys don't care about the odds. Anything can happen in this game. Anything. So you figure the boys'll be hitting tomorrow? I sure hope so. You got to pitch better than your last time out. I suspect I will. -Thank you very much. -You're welcome. Hello, friend. Who do you want me to sign this to? You're gonna lose tomorrow. -Oh, is that so? -I know it for a fact. That your wife? Yeah. What's it to you? You don't lose tomorrow, she dies. -Who sent you? -You made a promise to certain people. -You son of a bitch. -You can't protect her. If I don't do it, somebody else will. First inning, Mr. Williams. What did he want, honey? Oh, nothing. He was just givin' me some advice on how to pitch the game tomorrow. Everybody's an expert. O say can you see By the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars Through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night That our flag was still there O say, does that Star spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free And the home of the brave? Excuse me, sir. I would like to bet you that my husband, Lefty Williams, will pitch a no-hitter game. Ma'am, in my opinion it won't go past the very first inning. I will bet you $5. Okay, bring it in, Lefty. Bring it in. Bring it in. Let's go, Lefty! Take a shower, Williams! Bear down, Lefty! You can do it! Ball. Pitch over the plate! James, get your arm ready! Shit! What the hell are you throwin'? Nothin' but fastballs. Slow ones. James, you're in. Didn't take you long, did it, Lefty? Told you it wouldn't go past the first. Got a tip on it. Thank you. Thanks. Cincinnati scores again. Score is four-nothing. -Tough inning, huh? -Yeah. They'll come back. Comeback! Comeback! Come on! These five. Maybe more. You prove it, this town will never forgive you. Yep. You had a damn fine series, Bucky. We lost. We didn't get the breaks. Maybe we just weren't good enough. That's a load of bull, Kid, and you know it. Game two. Who's the best control pitcher in the league? Lefty Williams, right? The guy's throwin' it all over the fuckin' ballpark. I'm asking him for curve balls all day. A high fly ball, and Hap... "Question: Did Gandil say anything? "Answer: Yes, he wanted to know if they were being double-crossed." Sign the petition here! Show the Sox we're behind them. Stop the lies! Sign this letter now! Will you please sign, ma'am? Sign the petition! "Such writers are leeches, "sucking the lifeblood of honest sportsmen, "and should never again be allowed to darken "the threshold of a professional arena." You're a leech, Hughie. Keep reading. "These writers use up valuable newspaper space "that would be better employed for an exposé of the long-nosed, "thick-lipped gambling elements that prey upon the boys in the field." Makes you proud to be a sportswriter, doesn't it? Now I don't want any reward money, Mr. Comiskey. I just figure you should know what's what. Why did you wait till now to tell me this? Well, I thought maybe it was only one or two games, that they'd straighten it out themselves. I didn't want to be a squealer. I'll take it under advisement. What's that mean? You're the college boy. You tell me. It's your ball club, Mr. Comiskey. Harry, get me Alfred Austrian. Protecting the organization that you've built and maintained is what's best for baseball. Now, some kind of investigation is gonna be launched. Our job is to control that investigation. In fact, to appear to be leading that investigation. Albert, if I lose those players... -You might not have to. -They are guilty. That, from a business point of view, is irrelevant. What's important is that your business, baseball, is going to take a shellacking at the ticket window unless you and you fellow-owners make the public think that you are absolutely clean in this matter. How do we manage that? We felt that with your record of service, and with the high esteem the public... We need a commissioner. Someone outside of baseball who'd have certain powers to rule... Absolute power. -Absolute powers. -Won't work any other way. People won't believe it. Absolute power. Well, anyhow, we felt that the man that cleaned the Reds out of the country during the war was the right man to clean up baseball. We are prepared to offer you a two-year contract... -Lifetime contract. -Lifetime? A man worried about his job is bound to play favorites. Now you gentlemen don't want that, do you? Well, a lifetime contract seems... I'm back in court in five minutes, gentlemen. Let's talk salary. A man who, in the dark days of the last great conflict, made use of his official trust to fight the Hun on these very shores. A patriot of the first order, a family man... Landis used to lead the league in reverse decisions. He says he's gonna clean up baseball. He can start with the birds up on the stairs with him. ...over our all-American pastime of baseball. It gives me great honor to introduce Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Read all about it! Baseball on the ropes. Read it here! Grand jury called! Read all about it! So long, suckers. Wait here, Mr. Cicotte. Eddie. This is the man handling the grand jury, Eddie. He's got the goods on you. You come clean, he'll take care of you. -Eddie. -Sign this, Eddie. I know what you want to know. I know. Yeah, we were crooked. We were crooked. What's the story? What'd you tell 'em? -Was it fixed, Eddie? -Who was the brains, Eddie? Did you get immunity, Eddie? For spilling the beans, did you get immunity? What's that? They just want to clean out the gamblers, Joe. Not the ballplayers. I got to stay out of trouble. They don't want you in jail, they want you to be a witness. Now, you just sign right there. -My wife usually... -You got to sign to be a witness, Joe. Everybody does. Eddie signed it. Lefty. -What's the scoop here, Hap? -Yeah, the word is, you made a bundle. Yeah, sure, I saw some cash. They promised us all $20,000 each but all I saw was five. What am I gonna do, call a cop? You looked pretty good out there for a guy dumpin' games. -Somethin' must've come over me. -You double-crossed the gamblers? No, no, I'm a man of my word. So why did you do it, Hap? Did somebody lean on you? Everybody else was gettin' some. I figured, without the pitchers, we're gonna lose anyway. So why shouldn't I get fat, too? I may be dumb, fellas, but I'm not stupid. Well, that wasn't so bad, was it, Joe? Kind of felt good to get it off my chest. You did the right thing, Joe. We're proud of you. Joe, over here. What did you say, Joe? Were you in on it? -What's the story? -Hey, Joe. Come on, who was the big cheese? Who did all the brainwork here? Why'd you wait so long to spill it, Joe? -Swede is a hard guy... -Joe. Say it ain't so, Joe. Say it ain't so. Hey, Joe! I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Ben Short, Mr. Tom Nash, and Mr. Michael Ahearn. You may not be familiar with their names, but I would say they're the Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker, and Zack Wheat of the legal world. Who's the Babe Ruth? That's me. Now, these are the men who are gonna be taking care of you during the trial. You have only two choices, do exactly what we tell you to do or go to jail. You guys are such hotshots, you don't come cheap. Who's footin' the bill? You boys have a lot of fans in this town. Some of them are very wealthy people. How about a name? Rule number one in a conspiracy trial, the less you know, the better off you are. Mr. Rothstein feels that he and your Mr. Comiskey have certain interests in common. Negative publicity can be very bad for both of their businesses. What does he want? The confessions. And the players? I'm certain that you can help them understand where their best interests lie. They'll do what they're told. If I had the jack, I'd get my own damn lawyer. Only Commie won't let us have our series bonuses. Who do you think is payin' for the guys you got? You think it's Commie? Put your shoulders back. Of course it's him. You think he's gonna let the best ballplayers in the game slip away without a fight? You look handsome. I look like a future jailbird. Sox trial starts today! Get the news! Trial starts for Black Sox! Sox trial starts today! Looks like school's out. There's Commie's lawyer. He's got counsel lined up for the boys. I thought Commie was testifying against them. Depends which way the ball rolls. If Commie says one thing that'll hurt him in the cash register, I'll eat my hat. Three signed confessions, that's a tough hand to beat. This is Chicago, my friend. Anything can happen. Here they are! Edward Cicotte, Joseph Jefferson Jackson, Arnold Gandil, Charles Risberg, Oscar Felsch, Frederick McMullin, Claude Williams and George Weaver are hereby accused of conspiracy to commit a confidence game on one Charles Nims. Who the hell is Charles Nims? Some sucker who bet on us in the series. When did you first become aware of the conspiracy? You mean the possibility of a conspiracy? Oh, pardon me. The possibility of a conspiracy? Shortly after the series began. And you took no action? I informed Commissioner Ban Johnson, I hired private detectives to check on the players, and I personally kept a scorecard of every game. What did you find? Hearsay. Nothing that would warrant publicly slandering honest ballplayers. -If they're honest. -So you think they're innocent? I'll abide by the ruling of the court. Why are you appearing today for the prosecution? -I owe it to baseball. -So you are making an accusation. -Not if they're innocent. -But you have suspicions. They have been indicted by a criminal court. If that isn't suspicious, I don't know what the heck is. They pitched it to me. They asked me if I knew somebody willing to put up money if they dumped the series. -And you made this connection? -I know a few people. Did you ever stop to think about the legality of your action? Introducing people who want to get together? Bettin' on the Reds? I'm just actin' on a tip, some inside dope, like any guy would. And how much did you profit from your inside dope? Not a red cent. They busted me in the third game. So the players double-crossed you? There's no honesty in this world. In fact, your reason for testifying is revenge, isn't it, Bill? If the players had really been crooked and lost the third game, you would have been satisfied. You think you're even with them now? I will be before I leave here. You don't like me much, do you, Bill? Sure I do, Ben. If we'd had a smart fellow like you at the head of this deal, we'd all be rich now. Who was present at this meeting? Chick Gandil, Risberg, Hap Felsch, Cicotte, Williams, McMullin and Buck Weaver. Joe Jackson was not present? No, but he knew what was goin' on, just like he said in the confession. To what confession are you referring? The confession he gave to the grand jury. Can I ask that the prosecution produce these alleged confessions? Please bring them forward. We don't have them, Your Honor. They've been stolen. Order! Order! Sit down, or I'm going to clear this court! Must have cost somebody an arm and a leg. -Rothstein's? -Or Comiskey? Or maybe Rothstein's arm and Comiskey's leg. I want you to move out to the farm if I go to jail. You think they'll decide guilty? I always figured it was talent that made a man big, you know? If I was the best at something. I mean, we're the guys they come to see. Without us, there ain't a ball game. Yeah, but look who's holding the money and look at who's facin' the jail cell. Talent don't mean nothin'. And where's Comiskey and Sullivan, Attell, Rothstein? Out in the back room, cuttin' up profits, that's where. That's the damn conspiracy. You would have won, too. You would have beat those guys so easy. Well, won't nobody ever know that now. You lived and worked with these men every day. You shared trains, and hotels, and locker rooms. And they never purposely or inadvertently let slip of their plans? I find that hard to believe. Relations between me and most of the defendants were strained. Why was that? Personal differences. And yet you were positive that there was a fix on. It sounds like you had it in for the defendants. -I suspected there was a fix. -You said you were positive. No, you said that. And if you want, I can show you where, in the court transcript. On what were these suspicions based? Some of the guys didn't seem to be putting out 100%. Mr. Collins, have you ever played a game when you were not in peak mental and physical condition? Occasionally. Have you ever played a game where you were distracted or upset, and couldn't find it in you to give your best effort? No. Couldn't or didn't put out 100%? Didn't give it the college try? No, never. Then you're a very remarkable man, Mr. Collins. Well, you said it, I didn't. Your Honor, please, could I say something, please? This man is not asking... Could we have some order here, please? He's bunchin' us all together. Who's he to talk? Collins wouldn't even hit his own weight! Your Honor, if it pleases the court... -Sit down, Bucky. -Shut up! If it pleases the court, I would like to take the stand. You'll take the stand when you're called. What if they don't call me? Please be seated. Wait a minute now. What if they don't call me? Be seated! Your Honor, I want a separate trial! The fact that I never took a penny hasn't been brought up once. I hit 327 in the series. I didn't make an error! I'm being charged with a conspiracy I didn't have nothing to do with! Sit down, Mr. Weaver. I'm going to have to hold you in contempt of this court. Come on, Buck, sit down. Nobody's interested in your batting average. Will the prosecution care to cross-examine? No, Your Honor. "The trial will continue tomorrow, "with Black Sox manager, Kid Gleason, expected to take the stand." What's all this "Black Sox" stuff? Smart guys. Reporters think they're smart guys. All I want to do it go back and play ball and forget about it. I don't know if they're gonna let you do that, Joe. There's all this stuff about how baseball can't have no cheaters. I played good. They gotta let me play. If they don't, what ware y'all gonna do? I don't know. How long were you a player in the big leagues, Mr. Gleason? Long time. Over 20 years. I was a pitcher. As a pitcher, you had a great deal of control over the outcome of a game. Well, sometimes the other team had more control than I did, but, yeah, the pitcher, catcher, they had the most control. Were there gamblers involved in sports in your day, Mr. Gleason? Sure. How are you gonna keep them out? Were there incidents where games were thrown? I heard stories. Were you ever approached personally? Oh, no, no, not personally. I had a, you know, a reputation for bein' the kind of guy who wouldn't go for something like that. So, you never had any thought of instigating a deal? Oh, no, no, I never... I mean, I can see though where... Well, maybe if a guy feels he's bein' underpaid, and... Maybe falls in with the wrong kind of people, and they feed him a line how he could... You know, people are human. But I never... Not that I'm a Holy Joe or nothin' like that... You don't have to apologize for being honest, Mr. Gleason. Yeah. Well... What do you think of these players of yours now, Mr. Gleason? I think they're the greatest ball club I ever seen. Period. Hey, Buck. Hi, fellas. Seen you outside court today. Some circus, huh? Is it true what they're sayin' in there? About Joe and the others? Don't be too down on the guys, fellas. When you grow up, things get complicated. You didn't do nothin' wrong, did you, Buck? Guess I never grew up. I still get such a bang out of it. Playin' ball. Same as I did when I first come up. You get out there, and the stands are full, and everybody's cheerin'. It's like everybody in the world come to see you. Inside that, there's the players, and they're yakkin' it up. The pitcher throws, and you look for that pill, and suddenly, there's nothin' else in the ballpark but you and it. Sometimes, when you're feelin' right, there's a groove there, and the bat just eases into it and meets that ball. And when that bat meets that ball, and you can just feel that ball just give, and you know it's gonna go a long way, damn, if you don't feel like you're gonna live forever. I couldn't give that up. Not for nothin'. How do you think they're gonna call it tomorrow? Look down to third base next year. You're gonna see Buck Weaver playin' his butt off. Yeah. "The aforementioned parties are also accused "of conspiracy to commit a confidence game, "on offense which in this case carries a maximum penalty of five years in jail "and a $2,000 fine." Does anyone have a statement to make before the final verdict is made? I do, Your Honor. Very well, Mr. Weaver. I want it put on the record somewhere that I asked for a separate trial, and I was refused. That evidence of my play in the World Series games was not admitted, and I never got a chance to take the stand on my own behalf. It will be so noted. A big setup. -Will the foreman read the verdict? -Yes, Your Honor. We find the defendants not guilty on all charges. That was a bigger fix than the series. Gamblers eight, baseball nothing. -You got your ball club back, Commie. -I will make them pay for this. -Hey, Chick. -Hey, small world, huh? All right. Make room for the clean Sox. -How you feelin', Joe? -Like a million bucks. I seen some lawyerin' in my day, but you people in Chicago got some lawyerin' birds. You could talk the buffalo right off a nickel, you put your minds to it. Now what did I tell you, Bucky? It was in the bag all the time. "Regardless of the verdict of juries, "no player who throws a ballgame, "no player who undertakes or promises to throw a game, "no player who sits in conference "with a bunch of crooked players and gamblers "where the ways and means of throwing a ballgame are discussed "and does not promptly tell his club about it, "will ever play professional baseball again." To baseball. Strike! Fella's playin' shallow in center, isn't he? He's new. Damn if that doesn't look like him. Look like who? Nah, couldn't be. He's gonna get burned playin' in so close. -How'd he get back there? -Who is that guy? -It is. It's him. -What's his name, the new guy? -He don't look so new to me. -Well, it says his name's Brown. -A name is easy to change. It's him. -Who's him? It's Joe Jackson. -What? -Get outta here.
