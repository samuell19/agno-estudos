A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM THE INDIAN OCEAN, AP 101 ISOLATION ZONE FOR PRISONERS ON DEATH ROW SHARED BY 12 ASIAN COUNTRIES Mom! Jin! Run! Mom! Jin, you have to run. I'll be right behind you. Go, now. Quickly! I said, run! Jin! Run! Hurry! Run away, now! Move, all of you. Go after her! Jin. Did you think you could outrun us? What are you looking at? Hey, what are you looking at? We have a new guy here. Get him! Mom! Mom. Mom. Mom! I know where he is. To be specific, Mom knows where Kuhn is. She'll tell you where he is when she wakes up. Could you please take us to where the rest of us are? I promise we'll tell you where Kuhn is. We'll tell you where you can find him. I promise. Please. It's past here. Kuhn's underlings might appear out of nowhere. We're almost there. You don't have to worry. No one else knows about this place. Sir, this way. Hurry. It's down here. Come this way. Go away. It's okay. Stay right there. You fool. How can you let an outsider in here? He saved our lives. But... Mom's hurt. What? Maly is hurt? Bring the stretcher! Hurry. Put her here. Hurry. Careful. - Maly. - Maly. Wake up. What happened? Maly! - Kill! - No! Mr. Bau, he's a good man. He protected us. Go to your mom. You're going to get a good scolding, young lady. Gather your energy. - One, two, one, two three. - One, two, one, two three. - The spirit of Mt. Surah. - The spirit of Mt. Surah. - We are invincible. - We are invincible. - We'll kill you, you son of a bitch. - We'll kill you, you son of a bitch. - You're done for, motherfucker. - You're done for, motherfucker. Kill him. - Mr. Bau. - Don't mess with us. You need to wake Grandpa Ipa up. We don't have time for this. Keep your eyes on him. Watch him. - Maly. - Maly. Grandpa, Mom is hurt. Grandpa! Stop pinching me, you old hag. Why do you keep bothering me? Just stay in the underworld where you belong with the dead. - Ipa. Come to your senses. - What? - You come to your sense. - But... Don't take my food! I told you not to eat what's mine. - The old hag ate everything! - Ipa. - Ipa. - She ate them all. Sun-ok is here. Your first love, Sun-ok. - What? - Sun-ok is here. Hold him, quickly. - Sun-ok. - She's here. My dear, Sun-ok. You're here. Sun-ok. That's enough. I'm back now. That idiot. I must have lost my mind again. Grandpa. Mom is in pain. Ipa, Maly is hurt. She's been poisoned. Hey, Jin. You little rascal. Are you going to keep causing us trouble? I'm going to kill Kuhn. He's not someone you can just go and kill just because you want to. Don't you know that already? If you keep going off on your own to avenge your dad, your mom will be put in danger, you idiot. Will you finally come to your senses only after you see Maly dead and buried in the ground? Why are you sulking? Why are you so defiant these days when you've been obedient all this time? Don't cry. He's... looking for Kuhn. No, he's not. Then why isn't he answering me? This jerk... Are you mute or what? Why didn't you answer me when I asked you something? He has no manners. Still... I don't think he's a bad person. What, are you kidding me? Only criminals are sent to this island. The likes of serial killers. They're the scum of the earth. Didn't you know that? What about you, then? What about my mom? Well, not everyone is bad. It may be because of circumstances beyond our control. That might be the case for him, then. Hey, Jin. Why is she acting up these days? Geez... You should consider yourself lucky. If you leave this place, you won't even last half a day. Kuhn's men are everywhere just waiting to kill us. They're in every corner of this island. You know what they like to do the most? Go human hunting. They catch us, play with us like we're a toy, and then kill us. For fun. That son of a bitch, Kuhn. I bet it's fun as hell for him. It's basically a living hell for us. Even though we're living in hiding and squirming like a worm for our survival, making it through is what matters the most. You got that? Then again, death is the only way out of this island. Do you want me to kill you? I'll do you the favor. It'll only take a second. Come close. What's so intriguing about him? Don't tell your mom about this guy, okay? Alright? Your mom is awake. Really? Let's go and see her. - Maly. - Mom. - Maly. - Maly. - Mom. - Maly. Are you okay? Are you hurt? No. I'm sorry, Mom. Are you alright, Maly? You should get some more rest. What happened? What do you think happened? I went through so much trouble to save you. It was the new guy that saved you. I told you not to... He's over there. What are you doing here? What's wrong? You know this guy? He's the son of a bitch I told you about. You mean, that cop? He's the cop that put you here? Do cops get sent to this place for killing people too? So, you understood everything I said? Then why didn't you say anything? For crying out loud... Mom, this man saved your life. Why are you here? Tell me where Kuhn is. Then I'll get out of your sight. Walk in the direction of a huge volcano. You'll find him there. Now, get lost. Mom... Are you really leaving? To find Kuhn? Wow. Look at him. Watch out for the poisoned arrows. Don't go around asking for directions even though you get lost. Jin. My gosh. She's a serious nutcase. Keep a watch on her. She's a real pain in the butt. Keep your eyes on her. This has taken me unawares. Who knew that a cop would be stuck on this island? Do cops go around killing people too? If it wasn't for him, I would never have given birth to Jin on this island. I know. It was really harsh of him to send you here even when he knew you were pregnant. What a heartless son of a bitch. From my observation, Jin seems to be missing her dad a lot these days. She's run off too many times already, saying she'll avenge her dad. She sure must miss the great times she had with him. Why wouldn't she? I can imagine how she must feel. You could practically say that I helped raise her to a large extent. She's much stronger than I am. Unlike her, I've never dreamt of revenge. I'm simply living in hiding in this shithole. Don't think of it that way. I told them to keep close watch over Jin, so she won't be able to run from this place. Don't worry. Geez. Those good-for-nothings! Mister! I know the way. There's a shortcut. I need to take my revenge. That bastard killed my dad. Sir, please! Were you sent here because you killed a person? Why are you looking for Kuhn? The day you came... It felt just like that day. Who do you think did that to Kuhn? We just have to cross this path. We're almost there. We'll have to cross this field of grass. But his men are everywhere in this area. Mr. Yang? Mr. Yang! Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang, I'll save you. Hold on for a bit. Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang! Mr. Yang! Dad, I'll send you a photo, so make sure to check it. Okay? Dad! Maly. Maly. Maly. She couldn't have gone this way. Let's go back. You should all go back. She's not stupid enough to have gone this way. - I think she... - Don't you know her? Maly! Shit. I'm not even her dad, how would I know? We have no choice. Let's go! Come on, hurry. Move your asses! Gosh. You sons of bitches. Geez. Don't! Are you trying to pick a fight? Let me go! Get up. Please get up. Please help me! This place is crazy. It's crazy, I'm telling you! Help me. Please help me. What the heck is this? This piece of shit. What are you doing? Who are you? Mister! Give me your best shot. Go back to your mom. Dad. Dad. Dad. Untie her, quick. Where is Jin? Where is she, asshole? If anything happens to Jin, I'll kill you. Take her to Ipa. Quickly. Did you take down all these men by yourself? You've got some skill. By the way, I'm sorry if there's anything I did that upset you. I think I was a bit insensitive to you as a fellow Korean. We're good, right? Geez, you don't have to glare at me like that. Gosh. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. Wait, wait. Where's Maly? Shit. - Maly. - Maly. - Maly.- Maly. - Maly.- Maly. - Maly. - Maly. Duck! Run! That way! Found you. Mister. Jin. Jin. Jin? Mom? Jin? Mom. Mom. Let's go home. Mom. He's hurt because of me. Mom. Maly. - Jin. - Jin. Maly. - Jin. - Jin. Maly. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. - Jin. There she is. Were you here all this time? Are you guys okay? What happened here? Mr. Bau. You little rascal. Why don't you ever listen? Do you know how troublesome it is looking for you? This place is too dangerous. What happened to him? He's the one who saved Jin's life. I see. That was nice of him. Let's go, now. It's too dangerous here. Mr. Bau. He's still breathing. Please. So what? Take him with us? Look, Jin. If we get caught because of him, we're all dead. It'll be the end for us. We have to save our asses first. Mr. Bau, please. He got hurt because of me. Why is she doing this to me? I'm sorry, it's my fault. I'll listen to you from now on. So, please? Mr. Bau, I beg of you. Damn it... Mom. I'm sorry. I'll be good from now on. Please save him. I'm begging you. Please. - The men are here. - What? - They are here! - Maly. We have no time to lose. Let's take him with us. Why are you making things difficult? He's going to get us killed. Keep them distracted. I'm sorry, Bau. Mr. Bau. Geez. Okay. Let's go! You be careful, okay? Bring it on! - Ipa. - Am I pretty? Sexy, right? Get ahold of yourself! Go away, bitch. I'm trying to look pretty here. I don't want to live like a beggar like you. - Grandpa! - Don't touch me, you ugly bitches. Go. - Go. - Please. No, no. Sun-ok, kiss me again. Kiss me again. Sun-ok. Stop it, you jerk. Looking at your face gives me the goosebumps. Everyone, get out. I hate this. Grandpa. You must save this man's life. I gave him first aid. Will he be alright? It's a vicious poison. Acokanthera spectabilis. He's lucky, though. The arrow narrowly missed his artery, and the poison hasn't spread. Will you be able to save him? I always do my job right. It's their fault if they don't make it. Is it poisonous? To most people it is. But we can use it as medicine. It's effective when it's brewed. He'll need to be as tough as nails. If he makes it, good for him. If not, he'll probably meet my wife in his afterlife. Stop tickling me, you old hag. Why do you keep bothering me? Brew it. Everything happens for a reason and there's a right time for everything. Life and death aren't much different. Isn't that so, old hag? Hey. Did we throw them off? Geez. Why do we have to go through this ordeal because of that bastard? It's hard to get by as it is. How can Maly do this to me? Don't you think so, too? You are awesome. You can do it. Don't worry. Everything will be alright because we have you as our boss. You're the best. God, I have no idea what the hell he is saying. Run! No, Captain! - I said, get the fuck out of here! - Captain! This language barrier is killing me. - Get out of here! - Okay. What is he doing? - What are you doing? - Okay. Hey! Hey. Gosh, this fucker. I told you to run away. I can't communicate with him. - Captain. - Shut up, you idiot. I have no idea who you're talking about. Let's go. Hey. You let us go. What are you doing now? What the... Hey, get that hunchback away from me. Shit, that hunchback makes me cringe. Don't come any closer. What are you going to do? Hey. Wait. Are you really going to cut off the only hand that I have? Why not kill me instead? Hey... What... Truong! That fucking asshole. Fucking asshole. Lift your thumb, you idiot. Lift it! That fucking cop. Where's the cop? Where is he? None of this would have happened if it wasn't for that cop. Bring the cop out. Where is he? If we hand him over, we can all live. Our lives are at stake. We have to hand him over to them. Bring him! Bring him, now! It's for our survival. Hand him over. Bring him, now. Hurry up and bring him! Shit. Hey. This isn't what you promised. Maly. We should give them the cop. How did this happen? If we hand them the cop, it'll all be okay. You think handing him over will solve this mess? He swore on Truong's life. Let's give them what they want. Please. You're putting us in danger just to save your ass? No, that's not true. I'm doing this so we can all live. It's that cop who is about to get us all killed. No, Takuya. Takuya! Takuya. We don't have time to be slayed by you bastards. No, no! No! Mister! Sir, please. No! Shasha! Shasha! Shasha! Die, you son of a bitch. Motherfucker. Fine, you old hag. Take them all. Take them. No. Dad! No! Fuck! Jargal. Please. Please. Please, have mercy on us. Please don't do this. Jin. Jin. Jin. Jin! Jin! It didn't take very long for peace to be restored in the island that was once a living hell. That was the last I had seen of Mr. Yul. We thought he was the only person who made it out of the island alive. WE DEDICATE THIS MOVIE TO ACTION STAR KIM PIL-SU WHO PASSED AWAY DURING FILMING
