Which room's the kitchen? That would be over there. What room's this? Well, living room. With part of the upstairs bedroom collapsed into it. Strange. Huh? WOMAN: Are you looking forward to living With your grandmother? I don't know. I don't remember her. My mom hated her, though. Well, she sounded excited to see you. She's got lots of things planned for you. MAN (ON TV): Sex! Yes, sex, drugs, and rock and roll. And who is behind sex, drugs, and rock and roll but Satan Himself? Now friends, we must save our children From this dark and evil temptation That is visited upon them by Satan. [Car door closing] So I say to you, friends, we cannot Let our children have idle minds. You know, it reminds me of something... Oh, there you are. I'm so happy to see you. Come on in and give your grandma a hug. Miss Long, I'm Anna Nakashi. We talked on the phone. Oh, yes. Hello.

Could you tell if either victim suffered from a stab wound? Stab wound? Yeah. Well, I don't know, you know. With so little tissue, it's really tough to tell. Now, if the blade had nicked a bone, I might be able to find that. I thought this was an accidental death. Will you take another look?

Well, well, Debbie, these things happen. I mean, you're young, and you're full of life. But if you want to remain in this house, You better learn to give me the respect I deserve. Now, when I tell you something, I mean it. And you better obey me and be on time. God damn it, you're hurting me. How dare you use that language in this house? You're not going to turn into the foul-mouthed tramp Your mother was. Oh, no, no, no. I'm gonna teach you a little discipline. Now, you sit in there, and you think what you have done. Tomorrow you'll clean the garage and the attic. MR. RINALDI: Now, Joy can't deal with the spiritual world At all. So what she is symbolizing is is the non-believer.

Thanks, Joyce. Anytime. Debbie? Miss Long? Hi, Miss Nakashi. You scared me. Sorry. How's school? Good. Any trouble with Fiona? No. She's OK. Thanks. Oh my god. What happened to your face? The cut... Nothing! Nothing. I just... fell. Debbie, you can tell me. What happened? Was it Fiona? You can tell me. It's really OK. She won't be doing that anymore. I'm so sorry. I should have known with your mother's history of abuse. What? I think it's best you come with me now. I like it here. I don't want to leave. I have to take you out of any abusive situation. And after what those detectives told me, I... Detectives? Would you like some lemon? I think it's best you come with me right now. I'm sorry, Anna. I just can't do that. I've got a date. Of course. May I help you, sir? Yeah. I have a reservation. Rinaldi for two at 7:30. Rinaldi? Yes. The lady is already here. If you would follow me, sir. Here you are, sir. Hello, Peter. How sweet. No... no.

Why don't you and your friend go back to your antipasto? She's a minor. Let's go. I don't want to go. I don't think she wants to go, Peter. It's not your business. I said, come on. Let's go. Come on. I'm making it my business, Peter. Jesus, Peter. I know. What the hell's going on? I don't know. Honey, who's that? That's her. Just wait in the car. I've been waiting here forever. Peter, thank God you're all right. Don't. You were so great with those men last night. - Listen to me... - Peter... Just listen to me. You need some help. Peter. Listen, I'm going to talk to somebody at the school. No, you can't. I don't love you. Don't say that. Peter? It's all right, Marilyn. Just get back in the car. It's her. That's why you're being like this? This game stops now. OK, now this right over here? This could have been done with a large kitchen knife. And if that is indeed the case, it Was probably done with a right-handed sweep, Like this, from behind. And it could have gone deep enough To sever the carotid sheath, in which case, Would have stroked out like that. Detectives Homicide, looking for Principal Saunders. Just a moment. Cyanometry. P-S-Y-A-N-O-M-E-T-R-Y, blue tissue... anything blue. Wrong. S-I-A-N-O-M-E-T-R-Y, the study of blue light. Gentlemen, cyanometry, C-Y-A-N-O-M-E-T-R-Y, The study of blue in light. Is there anything else I can do for you? Uh, yeah. Mr. Rinaldi, she's in a meeting right now. Just ignore me. Joyce, I need a minute. We were just going to call for you. Please come in and sit down. Peter, this is Detectives Rosales and Archer. They're here because of Debbie Strand. We haven't been able to locate her this morning. And we understand that you were involved with her In some sort of an altercation last night. Yeah, I can explain that. Is something... is she OK? Well, I'd have to say no, she's not OK. What do you think? What do I think? Well, the reason I was coming to talk to Joyce this morning Was about Debbie Strand. You see, Debbie believes that she's... that We are in love with each other. Oh, good. Yeah. I've tried talking to her. Nothing gets through. She's obsessed or delusional or something. You haven't done anything to encourage This kind of behavior. No. No, I didn't. But you didn't feel it was necessary to tell Miss Saunders about this? Well, I thought I could handle it. I thought that it was a simple schoolgirl thing. You don't have kids? I have dozens. This girl's father was killed when she was a child. There was suspicion her mother did it but never proved out. On top of that, it looks like both her mother and father Abused her when she was young. Nothing about this girl is simple. [Knocking] I'm sorry. I have a call for Mr. Rinaldi. It's Debbie Strand. She says it's an emergency. [Sirens] We need to make this real clear. You do what we say, or I cuff you to the car. Stay behind me. Debbie? This is Detective Rosales. I've got Peter with me. DEBBIE: Go away. I only want to see Peter. He's out here. Come on out. We can talk about this. DEBBIE: No, I don't want to talk anymore. Just leave me alone. Debbie, you know we can't leave. We're here to help you. Let me go in there. Let me go first. Debbie? Why don't you... [Gunshot] Joe? DEBBIE: Why did you bring him here? Why won't you love me? No! God damn it, Peter. Get back here. Fuck, this hurts. Debbie? Debbie, it's Peter. Open the door.
