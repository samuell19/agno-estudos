Well, there's a bit of a stink of rotten fish, - but your Uncle James will get to the bottom of it. - Right. Hush now. Now, now, will you all be quiet? Be quiet. We all know that our village has fallen behind on its mortgage payments. Now. Me and me Da, we've been down watching a couple of fellows by the lake. And we are pretty sure that himself is up to something. That old scrooge, Hailstock or Haystack or whatever his name is. Greedy sod. Knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. Well, how much do we owe the scrounger? Well, I... I think it's about... One million, three hundred and sixty two thousand euros. Skipping lobster faced thief. You're purposely trying to squeeze us out, so you can rob us of the land. Where in heavens did you get an idea like that? Speaking of heavens... Perhaps some Hail Mary's and a spot of good old-fashioned grovelling to your maker might come in handy at this point? I will not stand by and have you take the name of the Blessed Virgin Mary in vain. - It's a good kick up the arse you need! - Now, now. Don't you be getting your hands dirty, you're a man of the cloth. I'll belt him, you can get the big fellow upstairs to forgive me. Hailstock, you've said your piece, now get out of our pub. Unless I'm mistaken, this is one piece of property that you don't own. Give me time, my dear. - Give me time. - Now, before I forget I'm a pacifist. Since when were you a paci... - Pettikreep! - Yes, sir? Hand it to them. -[man] Get out! -[woman] Get out! [woman 2] That's right, get out! -[man 2] Be gone with you. -[woman] Go on, get going. - It's a notice of foreclosure. -[woman] What did he say? -[Father] We've got 90 days to pay. -[woman] 90 days! But it's not our fault. Hailstock controls most of the jobs around here. Father, may I say something? - Let's all be quiet for the wonderful Michael O'Malley. -[clapping] - Shush, Brian McNulty, you be quiet now. -[Michael] Listen... I have an idea. You see, sometimes in America small towns will raffle off a vintage car, or a piece of land or whatever to raise money for the community. But what do we have, other than a bankrupt village? - We got this. - What? You mean Finnigan's? It's the only building we own, that Hailstock doesn't. But if the village goes belly up, then he'll put a lean on us personally. And it'll fall right into his lap. However, if we can sell it to an outsider, then he won't be able to get his greedy hands on it. Well, what do you think? Who's with me? [indistinct chatter] Well, I think it's a grand idea. I'm with you, Michael. Well, I think it's shite. [simultaneously] Aye. Me too. [simultaneously] Shite!

[rain keeps falling] [gentle music] [woman] Come on, Kathleen. Good girl, Kathleen. [indistinct chatter] The winning poem is called "Freedom." I think someone a little easier on the eye - would be more qualified to read this. -[laughter] How about it, Maureen? When are you going to make an honest woman of her, Michael? It's been a while since I had a wedding to look after! Hey, I volunteer. After all it's a real man she'll be needing, O'Malley. Did someone speak there? Was it a real man did you say? - It's not what I've heard. -[laughter] [everybody laughing] What are you two idiots laughing at? I tell you, she's too much woman for O'Malley. "Freedom. The great divide. The unknown truth, the intangible. The lure of the oppressed, the lie of oppressors. No one is free. Nothing is free. No one ever was and nothing ever will be. To manifest the notion of our inalienable right, is to play to their dogma. Dante was right. - Who the feck is Dante? -[Maureen] They feed us true lies. And we swallow it whole. Fear is the fuel, for many I know. Through the morning mist, a welcoming light. It must be Finnigan's so calm and so bright. Gimme a glass of cold beer. And I'll tell you what I know. That if it's Freedom you want. Then you gotta fight, fight, fight!" [cheering and applauding] - Very well read. - I'm not very good at doing things like that. Well, thank God for that. He must be Irish. Well, how much money did you raise, anyway? The contest netted almost one million euro. [cheering] That's not bad, like. Top. - Come on! - Unfortunately, we're still quite a bit short. But I reckon our new landlord will have a few ideas how we can raise the balance. If there's one thing the Yanks are good at, it's business. Ah, well, that's fine, 'cos the bloody Yank can pull the fecking balance out of his fecking arse. There's no need for that kind of language. [man] What is it, Doctor? Will someone please pass my scalpel? [laughs] To hell with the lot of youse. [laughter] Will you raise your glasses, to himself, our new landlord. A long lost son of Ireland! -[Celtic music] -[cheering] [cheering and applauding] [laughing] [music continues] [music stops] What the... [calm music] Hey! Alright. What's happening? It ain't Temptation Island, but we'll make it work. "Welcome to Ballywood." Hollywood to Ballywood. - Well, don't everybody talk at once. -[stutters] - K... K... - K, K, K, K, K... Huh? What? Hey, this ain't no clansman rally, is it? What the KKK, what you talking about? [speaking Irish] - Does somebody speak English? - Welcome to Ballywood? They're the deeds to Finnegan's pub. Finnegan's yes, the prize, the winnings, yes. I'm having my attorney look this over, you know what I'm saying? Oh, I appreciate that. Welcome, yeah. - Uh-hmm. [spits] -[woman] Oh, my God! What the hell is that, man? Where is the Cristal? Don't you all people know how to throw a party? Come on now, I'm just arriving, there's supposed to be some balloons. Black man coming through. What, what? You all playing with me right now. All these faces. Alright, where the native girls? Ha, ha. Alright, bring on the native girls. Where are the native women's? Supposedly, you're referring to me. No, I was thinking about the ones with the big Bootys. You know, you'll do. I mean, you know, we gotta work some things out. A little makeover, pluck the eyebrows, you know, collagen injection in the lips, because I like them big, like, mm, big, juicy, them the lips that just make your day. I'm homely. Is that what he said? Yes, is that... Hey, what's happening? Look out, girl, you know, we'll do a couple of things. - Yeah, we can flip this. - Father Duffy. Father Duffy. James McDevitt. You know, some people call me Jimmy da Jam in high circles. You know, with me Dre, Snoop and all us be hanging out, you know what I'm saying. Say a prayer for me to make sure this deed is correct. Otherwise, you know what I'm saying, I might have to get South Central up in here. You know what I'm saying? Don't understand how I played war. I like the outfit, the collar is working. Stay away from the little boys. - He's, he's a... -[Jimmy] What's up, fellas, how are you all doing? He's the new landlord of Ballywood's only pub. [Jimmy] I love this village already. - Yeah. - The door sticks. - So do I, baby, so do I. - Right, is everything else to your liking? No, not really, you know, but I'm going to make it work, baby, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Right then. Well, we'll leave you to get some rest. I'm sure you'll be needing your strength for the native girls. Make sure there's no fat ones, you know, I got a thing with the fat ones. You know what I'm saying, anything over 185 pounds ain't to my liking. I like them po'teek, perteek, poe teak. You know what I'm saying, not really po, but kind of teaky. You know, I want something nice and slim, got a nice little bottom on it. Something I can really work with. Because they broke the mold when they made me, baby, - I'm telling you. -[Maureen] I think that's the smartest thing you've said since you arrived. Oh, that's me! S dot, M dot, A dot, R dot, T dot. Art. S. M. Art. Smart. - You can spell, good. - Smart! Enough to get my own club. [shouting] Doing it P Diddy style. Going to get some action going on up here, bling, bling. It ain't Jamaica, but I'm gonna "ja make" the best of it. [laughs] Bye, bye. Right, is that everything do you think? [Brian] Would you like some help with them groceries? Or would you prefer himself to be carrying them for you? The new landlord. -[chuckles] -[scoffs] Shouldn't youse lot be getting back to the zoo before it closes up for the night? Hmm? Or perhaps a swift kick up the arse will get you there quicker? Now, out of the way. [exhales] I'll not be looking to fight the weaker sex. Me neither, but in your case I'll make an exception. - There's something I can do for you boys? -[Brian] No, Father. [sheep bleating] Just catching up with the gossip. It's good to see you taking an interest in the welfare of the village. [rooster crowing] Off youse go now. See youse all at mass on Sunday? - Yes, Father. - Yes, Father. And confession on Saturday? - Yes, Father. - Yes, Father. They're lovely boys, lovely boys. So, is he a Catholic? - Who? - Well, himself, you know, the new fellow. I don't know. I didn't ask. Aye, not to worry, I can always convert him. If not, eh? She can always whip him into shape with her tongue. Mm. And if that fails, he can bore him into submission - with his hell's angel stories. -[Father laughs] - You're a hard woman, Maureen. - Must be genetic, right? So, what do you think of the gold tooth? You like it, do you? And himself? Do you think he's a bit mad or just a bit hyper? What do you think, you're scared, do you? Yeah, well, I suppose I would be too with the likes of the McNultys waiting to pounce. McNulty zombie. I am a McNulty and I am a stupid zombie. Is that your best zombie? Come on, you can do better than that! [suspenseful music] [Hailstock] Now, make sure you idiots don't mess this up. There's plenty more where this comes from, consider it a down payment. You alright, Grandad? You're awful quiet. Well, what's to become of us? What do you mean? Oh, we'll be invaded surely! What, by the Vikings? No, no, them... them rappers and their gangs. - Are you mad? - No, no I know them bloods and them crisps. - Oh, it'll be like that film, the Boys and their Hoods. - What? [stutters] There'll be naked Bootys on every corner. There'll be gangsters with them, Dirty Harry guns, selling that crackaine stuff. And there'll be them driveaways and people popping each other's arses! I can't believe you're saying this, you're the one who taught me to have an open mind. - Oh, my God! - I tell ya I had you then, I had you there! -[laughs] - You're just a big kid, is what you are. [keeps laughing] Right. Kathleen! Come on, your dinner's ready. [clears throat] Well, come on. What's really the matter? Well, we're... ...close to 400,000 short of settling the mortgage payments. And that's without even paying off the principle. Mm. And what is the principle? - It's about seven million. - Seven million euro? Well, why did no one tell me that before? I mean, seven million euro! Because we knew you'd shoot your mouth off and you'd get all hot and bothered. - That's not true. -[Pat scoffs] But seven million. I mean, my God! What are you, a bunch of idiots? There you go, you see. You're on a roll. You're... You're constantly persistent! I need some air. - Yeah, air? I think it's a drink more likely. - Argh! Well, I hope you've got some money, because the new landlord might not accept credit. -[blows a raspberry] -[blows a raspberry] Come on, grace, please. Shall I say it? For what we're about to receive may the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen. [indistinct chatter] - You alright? - Aye, yeah. I'm alright. Jimmy Jam is a freak of nature. Work it, boy, you can break it backs. Give me some of that four-leaf clover. Yes, indeed, bend over the four-leaf clover. You look like you're Irish. You're lucky, 'cos I'm here, 'cos Jimmy da Jam... [upbeat music] [music stops] Hey, baby. Uh... [sighs] Would you look at that? -[chuckles] -[door closes] You ain't ever getting any. [Brian] And we'll not be taking another drop from Finnegan's 'till he's out from behind that bar! - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh, good evening, lads. Tell me, - what's going on? - We're having a meeting. - Oh, what is it about? -[Malachy] Aye. [Brian] About where to go for a drink. Yes, I'm thinking that's a... that's a very difficult one, yes. - That's right it is. - It's a difficult one. Yeah. Being as there's only one pub in the village. Yeah. Hey, but himself's in there. And he's Black, in case you hadn't noticed. - Aye, Black. - No, but it could rub off. - Jesus, no? - It could. [laughs] Come on. Come in for a jar, my shout. And we thought you was one of us, Pat Duffy. An Irishman. Well, no, maybe I am. As that's what it says on my birth certificate. Then why are you off to consort with one of them? Did you know that in America we were known as the Green Niggas. - That's a lie, that's a lie, everyone! -[Pat] Toasted Irishmen. And in England as recently as the '‘50s, there were many guesthouses that had signs up saying, "No Blacks, no dogs, no Irish." Aye, well, the English can kiss my arse. No, they can't. And the famous journalist who said, "Now that Kennedy is President, the Irish are almost White." Huh? Do you see any parallel in that? - I don't see nothing of the sort. - Then you're a lot thicker than I gave you credit for. And I won't be hanging around here. I'm away for a drink. Ah, it's not fair. I'm fecking dying out here. Aye, me too, I thought we were meant to be infiltrating. Not standing about like bloody idiots. You're a traitor, Pat Duffy. Oh, I know it, and I've a desperate thirst and I'm going to quench it. [upbeat music] Jesus, that... He looks like a packet of M&M's. If you stuck a plug up his arse you could light up the whole of Ballywood. [upbeat music continues] Thank God you haven't got access to your full optics, Danny. What's Crack-a-lacking? I know a lot of you all are in a state of shock. But that's alright, I'm here to help. You know what I'm saying, where I come from we kick it! I'm going to resurrect some people. I'm going to do a Jesus, - I'm going to come by and lay my hand on you... - What's he saying? -...put a drink to your door, but... - It beats the hell out of me. - First thing we've got to learn... - But he's got balls, - I'll give him that. Big ones. -...how to do is kick it. You know what I'm saying? I don't want nobody tripping. Tripped? Who tripped? Where's my medical bag? Yeah. Oh, by the way... ...free drinks for everybody!

Look, the little green dude. The kids will like that. So this Lord Hailstock owns the entire village? He inherited the land. He owns everything, lock stock and barrel. - Except Finnegan's that is. - No wonder you all hate the English. That's outdated. We just don't like anyone who takes advantage of us. - Forty acres and a mule. - What's that? Well, when President Lincoln freed the slaves the government promised all of us like forty acres and a mule. You know, Black people got happy. We started running around, break dancing. We still break dancing. Still waiting. - We didn't get a doggie, ain't seen an acre. -[laughs] It's funny isn't it? Someone offers you an aspirin and gives you a headache. Pettikreep, I trust you've had time to review the surveyors report. -[Pettikreep] Yes, Your Lordship. - Good. Then we can proceed. As long as no one minds Leprechaun Land being under water. What? The whole area is a bog land, sir. Anything built there would sink faster than a pint of O'Malleys, sir. - Has anyone else seen this report? - Not a soul, sir. Well, see that it remains that way. - But, sir... - Is there a problem? [sighs] It's bog land, sir. Legally we're supposed... You know, I've always envied you, Pettikreep? - Yes, sir? - Blessed as you are with a steady job, a generous employer and a warm, cozy place to live. Yes, sir. It would devastate me to see you on the streets, penniless. Yes, sir. I want you to contact our people in Los Angeles. I need to know everything there is to know about our new landlord. I have to have that pub to conclude the deal. - Oh, and Pettikreep? - Yes, sir? - Never ever forget who butters your bread. - Yes, sir. So this Hailstock's going to suck everybody dry, huh? Yeah, like a leech, and we stand to lose everything. Well, it ain't like things are bopping around here, you know. Ain't no big parties going on. And this amusement park would be good for business. Everybody can make money. - The pub, which I own. - Yeah, but at what cost? I mean, we lose this fight, we stand to lose everything that's made this community what it is. [indistinct chatter] [Celtic music] You know? Money doesn't always buy you happiness. It's what you do with it that counts. Or so they tell me. Yeah, you got to spend it on the finer things in life. [romantic Celtic music] - Well, goodnight then. - Goodnight. Hey, Jimmy. You know, um... I've often thought that our two cultures were very similar. You know... I watched The Commitments seven times. Yeah? [chuckles] Well, I thought that Jungle Fever was a... How would you say it? "All good." [laughs] Well, I'm getting a little jungle flu out here. You're okay, Jimmy. Just a bit misguided is all. This is a photographic moment, let me put this in the memory bank. You're just a bit misguided, is all. [laughs] - Go away. - Alright.

Now, Jimmy, I want you to follow me finger. A bit of a shock to his system, but other than that I'd say he's in perfect shape. Apart from his dress sense, now that may be incurable. -[Father] Well, thank you, Doctor. - But he can't be moved. Not yet. Ah, he'll be fine. Come on, let's get him upstairs. He can have my room for the night. - Your bed? - Yes, unless you're volunteering yours. [crowing] [tense music] [whimsical music] [grunts] Ah! Hey, Jimmy. Did I wake you? [growls] Mm, Jimmy. That's just how I'm going to bite you. Then I'm going to chew you up, Jimmy. I'm going to chew you up. [screams] Eat it. [screams] Hey, Princess. Are you standing guard?

I'm going to tell you the rest later. - So how are you feeling, better? - I feel like a Hollywood hooker - hit me in the head with a... - Ah! Excuse me, this is not for her ears, thank you. Oh. Yeah, she's just talking up a storm, I mean, chatter Kathy over there. - Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap. - No. I think she's got the gift of the gab, haven't you? She just hasn't unwrapped it yet. -[Maureen kisses] Homework time. - Homework. Homework is good. Stop all that talking! Have you been feeding her a load of old rubbish, have you? Uh, just the part about homework being good and learning. - Boring. - You do have a tendency to exaggerate, don't you? Exaggerate me? No. See, the lump on my head is not an exaggeration, that is a lump. And that foot that was in my ass wasn't an exaggeration. So you have no idea who jumped you? I have no idea, but I'll never forget that funky breath. - Right, well. - That breath was... Oh, and I put your clothes in the washing machine on a bright colors cycle, so that should cover it. Uh, you've a bath run, - and I've put you out some proper clean clothes. - Clothes? Hey, I'm naked. Well, did you expect me to put you in with them? [chuckles] Don't get your knickers in a twist, I've seen it all before. I've cooked and cleaned for my Granddad and brothers since I was nine. I'll see you later. Oh, and apparently, it's not true what they say about Black men, is it? Hey, it was cold. Cold, you know, it was cold. Hey, look, look, it's like a pole. You can put a flag on it, I'm telling you. She don't know I was born with one leg. I had to learn how to walk on it. I've got to take my shoe off every time I go to the bathroom. Aha, no, I'm not. They don't know... Rewind.

Breakfast in bed? Michael, I'm not sure I like where this conversation is going. Look, Maureen. I know I'll never be able to replace Frank. And I don't expect to. But I think... ...it's time I made an honest woman of you. - Look, Michael I... - No, please... ...let me finish. [somber music] I know I'm not perfect. And I know you don't love me. But I'm sure you could learn to in time. And besides, Kathleen needs a father figure in her life. And you know I love her like me own. - You know I will. - Yeah. Well... What do you say? Well, I suppose when you put it like that, it makes sense. It's just... [Jimmy] Hey, Michael. Hey. What happened to your hair? Oh, God. Everything good? Yeah, it's... um, all good. - Mm. - Look at that, don't we look fine. - Styling and profiling, baby. - I'd say almost Irish. - Well, you know, I know how to put some things together. - Mm-hmm. Oh, and domesticated too. Good, I like that in my rappers. So, Jimmy, tell me... ...what do you want out of life? What's going to make you happy? Let's see, peace on earth. No, that's the answer that models give. I want to be rich, I want to be famous, you know what I'm saying? Because me and music are one, you know? Music is like my best friend. You know? I could make it too, all I need is a shot. Alright, so, When you perform at Finnegan's, why... Why do you always impersonate someone else? Hey, that's what I do, that's who I am, you know what I'm saying? No, no, it's not, it's not who you are. It's who they are. I think you should spend more time being yourself. I've never seen Kathleen this happy. And it's you that does it, it's not those fellows that you impersonate. Mm, well, you know, I've got magnetism, you know, like electro-magnetism. You know, that's the female species, you know, - the girls, the girls, they love me. [laughs] - Yeah? - Oh, okay, you want to start now? - I did a little bit. - Oh, here's a whole lot.

It seems our Mr. McDevitt wouldn't know a straight line if it jumped up and bit him on the arse. And then it would probably die of food poisoning. In short, one of life's losers. - A bit like you, Pettikreep. - Yes, sir. So, you're going to make him a financial offer he won't refuse. - I can't rely on those idiot McNultys alone. - Certainly, sir. - Oh, and Pettikreep? - Yes, sir. No mistakes. When I pull this off... ...I'll be rich beyond my wildest dreams. Come on, Chappie! [whimsical music] [sighs] [Jimmy] Ah, what up, Mr. Pettikreep? Yeah, what can I do for you this fine day? Oh, well, that is a lot of cheddar. No, I mean, cheese, cash, man, cash. Oh, yeah, we can come to some kind of agreement. I'm a businessman, business is what I do. [emotional music] And the deal was, if I didn't come up with the money, I had to marry their sister. She got all emotional, gave me some honeymoon money, and I lost it in a crap game. Then I split. [Maureen] What, you just left the little lady standing at the altar? [Jimmy] Little lady? No, we're talking 300 pounds. Pit bull. Block jaw. [emotional music] Have you ever been married? Yeah, I was once. What happened? [Maureen] It's a long story. Talk to me now, talk to me. [chuckles softly] Okay, um, he was called frank. He was called Frank, is that his name or they just called him Frank? -"Hey, Frank," but his real name is Doug. - No, his name was Frank. - We say it here differently. - Oh, okay. His name was Frank and we met a university in Dublin. So we got married and got pregnant. Well, I did, obviously. Well, if he got pregnant, you know, we need to study him. [laughs] - Do you want to hear the story? - Come on, girl. Anyway, Kathleen adored him, he was an amazing father. But one day he took her shopping, and... They were hit by a drunk driver. Frank was killed. She didn't have a mark on her. See supposedly, um... He protected her from the impact with his body. It was like he was making a deal with God. It was either... [sighs] you know... his life for hers. She was only four years old. Can you imagine, four years old? And he died in her arms. She hasn't spoken a word since. [emotional music] - It's going to be alright. - Oh, I know, we just... We take one day at a time and we live in hope. Do you know, if you ever, ever hurt her or you disappoint her... ...I promise you, I'll kill you. Did somebody just threaten me with bodily harm? Mm-hmm, well it's either that or I drop a line to the psycho lady. Hey, kill me, don't call the psycho, kill me. - You'd rather be killed? [laughs] - Yes, dead, gone, buried, dirt. - Hey! - Hello, Angel. How you doing there, Princess? - How are you doing? - Hey, hey, now, stop it. That's greedy, where's mine then? -[kisses] - Oh! [Father] The whole village is talking. [Pat] Well, it's all very confusing. He's a nice enough fella, if you make out what he's saying. But him and my only granddaughter. Oh, it is a bitter pill to swallow. - It's not a color thing now is it? - God forbid, I'm no racist! Jesus. [grunts] I'd always hoped that Michael and Maureen would be wed. He's a fine fella. He's a bit boring. But he'd be a good father to Kathleen. I want good things for them. Be careful, Da. Maureen's old enough to make her own decisions. Shove too hard one way, you may wind up pushing her the other. Well, I'll be leaving you. You know, Da? I've not seen Maureen this happy for years. Kathleen... Well, she may finally be about to open up, you know? Well, you missed your calling! You should have been one of them psychological fellas. What is the difference? [indistinct chatter] See Jimmy da Jam is a professional martial artist. Now you have your hand here, because once you block, you come through and strike with the action. Then as soon as they come, jump up in them. Alright? Jimmy Da Jam will teach you some more tomorrow, once I've loosened up. Have you no shame, Maureen Duffy? Bringing disgrace on your own kind? Walking around hand in hand with yon fellow. Aye, he's alright fighting with the kiddies. Unless you want to be trying them moves on a grown man? Come on, Jimmy the Raspberry Jam man. Show young Kathleen what a big fella you are. [Brian laughs] [cowing] - I thought so. - Come on. Come on. These yanks are all the same. - All mouth, no action. - What did you say? [smack] [gasps] I'm so sorry, I'm sorry. Are you okay? Oh, God, Jimmy, are you okay? I'm so sorry, love. You hit like a girl. I'm cool. [indistinct chatter] Come on, let's not be hanging around with the riff raff. - We're not hanging around with the riff raff. -[laughter] Ah. [clears throat] You know, they were lucky you were there. Because, you know, I was about to go Bruce on them, you know. Whoa! But you know, I just... The art of fighting without fighting. There you go. I left some stew on stewing, you know. I want to make sure it's stewing properly. Put some spices in it, you know? Us Black people like it spicy. Alright, catch up with you all later. Don't forget what I told you. [Maureen] Hey, Jimmy. I'm really sorry. [mumbles] Macho man, baby. Come on. What youse looking at? Come on, love. [crow cawing] Please excuse the interruption, Lord Hailstock. My name is Suzuki. Suzuki? Suzu... The Suzuki? The Japanese industrialist? It has been brought to my attention that you are planning to build a hundred million dollar theme park in Ireland. And I would be very interested to invest in such a project. I can offer you 90% of the funding and charge no interest on the loan. You put in other 10%, I will give you first recoupment. Oh, indeed, well, that sounds reasonable. I think it would be prudent for us to meet. I will organize my trip as soon as possible. Outstanding. I look forward to seeing you. So do I. Sayonara. Yeah. Pettikreep. Pettikreep, can you hear me? -Pettikreep! -[static noise] - Yes, sir. - Bring me a bottle of the, uh, '53. Immediately, sir. -[Hailstock with static] And Pettikreep? - Yes, sir. Did you handle that situation? I spoke with him. It won't be a problem. He was very agreeable. I thought so. Bloody Yanks or anything for a quick buck. Especially this one. [bell tolling] [Father] Good morning, to you all. [congregation] Good morning, Father. Now, as you all know we have a new addition to our little family.

But, as I'm kind and caring, there'll be no evictions. Thousands of tourists will soon be upon us. And Mr. Suzuki has kindly agreed to offer some of you jobs. And, although menial, it will be a living. Those of you fortunate enough to be selected will of course be required to wear the official theme park uniform. [shouting] Pettikreep! [indistinct chatter] The pointy shoes haven't arrived yet. But being as they are one size fits all, I'm sure they'll be nice and snug. I'd sooner suck a dead dog's eye than wear that! Haven't you done enough damage to this village already! [Jimmy] Hailstock. This is a house about the good word. I ain't got nothing but bad words for you. So you might want to agitate the ground. -[man] Right, Jimmy. Go on. Tell him. - Kick rocks. -[crowd] Yeah. - Leave you mother... Excuse me. Right on. Just go.

Slacking as usual. - Any news? - Just had confirmation that the Japanese funding has been transferred into the Leprechaun land account. Ah... All those zeros. Bloody marvelous. What happens when the Japanese find out that the land is not fit for building on? Well, it works like this. I raise ten million euros mortgaging the entire village and all its contents to the hilt. And Suzuki provides the other 90%. I immediately award 20 million in bogus building contracts to my own dummy companies. Now, as soon as the Japs find out that the land round here has the consistency of sponge cake, Suzuki will quietly take back his cash in order to avoid a scandal. Minus, of course, the 20 million I've already siphoned off. I pay back my creditors and pocket a cool ten million. Genius, sir. I think so.

Shut up and be quiet, the lot of youse. [indistinct chatter] Now, Jimmy, I've read the words, and it does seem that your poem has been lifted from this Dime fellas record. Can I see that for a second, Father? Hmm. Dirty Dime. Dirty Dime. Yeah, yeah, he used to be with that group Nickel and Dime. I was going to play the cut for you. You know, "Nickel and Dime." He went solo, Dirty Dime. Well, look I... you caught me. I'm dirty. He's dirty. It's a dirty situation. Hey, guilty as charged. Somebody got some handcuffs?

By now you've probably figured out your bank account's been emptied. Damn, that's a lot of missing loochey. We all know about the land being no good. -And how you stashed a surveyor's report. - What's going on? Ah, let me see that would be fraud. Yeah, if my memory serves me, that is fraud. Look, I don't want you to go to jail for 20 years. So, here's the deal. Alright? You give back ten million minus the ten percent for my homies who helped me put this play together. -Fast Freddie and Diamond Jack. - Yo, what's up? [chuckles] And of course, my friend, the mole, which we'll get to later. -[woman] Who's the mole? - And you'll need to be returning the cash that the village paid you for the contest. No, no, no, no, you see, I... You don't talk yet. I'm not done. Also, you sign over Ballywood, all the surrounding land, including Finnigan's. -[woman] You're joking. - This way everybody gets what they want. You walk away clean. Well, almost. I might have to leak this to the press, you know. Let's see, "The Honorable Lord Hailstock tried to, uh, scam investors in a bad land deal." Oh, I say, Mole, uh, can you please pass the agreement -to the old boy there? Yes, yes. -[clears throat] Okay, Your Lordship, we need your signature on the dotted line, now. [indistinct chatter] Oh, and just so you know, we have some insurance. It's a copy of the surveyor's report. Addressed to Lord Hailstock. The minute my man Pettikreep is alright, I'll transfer the balance back to your account. Oh, one last thing. Don't come back. The land belongs to the people. Irish, that is. [all cheering] I want you to get this Jimmy da Jam for me. I want you to stop him now! Well you, idiots? What are you waiting for? We won't be needing your blood money for what I have to do. Come on. By the way... ...I never did like butter on my bread. I'm a jam man, myself. Or to be more specific, a Jimmy Da Jam man. So you can stick your job up your arse. Ha! I've got a plane to catch.

[mouthing] Yeah. [crowd] Oh! Thank you. [ship horn tooting] [slow fiddle music] Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, look, I... Jimmy. [panting] Jimmy McDevitt, will you stop being so bloody stubborn! [seagulls squawking] You just going to leave and... and that's it. You can't do that. You can't just mess with people's feelings like that. God, what an idiot I've been. There was I thinking that you actually cared. - I do care. - No, you don't. Yes, I do. You know, for a moment there, Maureen, I thought you and I had something. - We do. - You and Kathleen. But I was just fooling myself. [sighs] - But... - No, don't "but." I mean, how many free beers I got to give away in this village? You can't buy acceptance, Lord knows I tried, three times a Sunday. Yeah, Jimmy is a likable guy. But, you know what? Deep down inside, they're all afraid of me. Afraid of who I am. What they think I represent. So I didn't disappoint them. Pulled off the scam of a lifetime. But it's all over now. It's time for Jimmy Da Jam to get back to... ...familiar territory. - Make another quick buck. - And then what? You spend it and you make another, and you make another and another. Where does it all end? Can't you see the emptiness of it all? Huh? Stay. Come on. What have you got to lose? You can't keep on running, Jimmy. What are you running from? Everybody loves you. They do. Everybody loves you, just the way you are. Are you going to make me say it, I love you. Okay. I love you. [crying] Please, don't go. [dramatic music] Please don't go. I got to go, Maureen. I gotta go. Jimmy! [Father] James McDevitt, you stop there! Or as God is my witness... ...I will not be responsible for my actions! - Now, there. - And that goes for me too. And remember, I hit twice as hard. McDevitt. McDevitt! You're a liar and a scam artist. This time I'm going to beat the hell out of you. But only if you take one more step towards that boat. This village needs you. Jimmy Da Jam man. We'd like you to stay. That's all of us. -[man] Please, Jimmy. -[woman] Please, stay. [Kathleen] Jimmy. My God. [gasps] Jimmy. [indistinct chatter] Please don't leave. Me dad left me. Don't you leave me too. Don't leave. [dramatic music] [bell tolling] [Father] Maureen Duffy. Kathleen Duffy.

Okay, then. You can count me in. [laughter] [exhaling] Thank the Lord for that. With the powers passed on down to me, I now declare you a family. [crowd] Oh! [Father] Well, go on then, Jimmy. You're legal, you may kiss the bride. You don't have to tell me twice. [Maureen chuckles] -[dramatic music] -[man] That's it, Jimmy.
