Georgie's going to be a farmer when he grows up. Only he's going to raise buffalo. Buffalo have all been killed. I know. My father killed them all. All the same, they aren't all dead. Anyway, that's what Georgie's going to be when he grows up. When I grow up, I'm going to be a soldier and shoot all the time. I'll be fierce. I'm going to be a WAC. And I'm going to shoot more than you do 'cause I'm older. No, you won't. You're a girl. Girls fight just as well as boys. Looky. When I'm a WAC, I'm going to pull out my gun. WACs don't have guns. I'm going to pull out my gun and go bang, just like that. Oh. You sure killed him, Selma. You killed him dead. Oh, oh, but I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to kill you, little squirrel. It was just pretend. Shucks, it's only a red squirrel. They're bad. But he wasn't doing anything bad. He was just eating his dinner when I picked up a rock... A-And I almost never hit where I aim. And... Hello. You're Selma. You're Arnold. Shucks, we know that. You're crying, Selma. It's bad for children to cry. It's worse for grown-ups. You're grown-up, and you cry. Let me hug you. No. Well, then I'll... I'll make you a chain of flowers. I'll make one for each of you. Ingeborg. Get back to your work. Good-bye. I don't like her, and I don't like her pa. I don't like her pa the most. Let's go down to the river and play. I don't feel like playing anymore. I want to go home. You want to play with Shadjack? You can. It's Editor. Hi, kids. Hello, Editor. Hi. Hop in. I'll take you home. I'm not going home. I'm having dinner at Selma's house. Aunt Bruna's going to fix egg pancakes. With jelly? No, with honey. We just met Ingeborg Jensen. I'm always meeting her. Every time I meet her, she always tries to hug me. Ingeborg hugs all little children. That's because she loves them. I'm not little children. I'm 5. Oh, excuse me. I'd forgotten. My mother says Ingeborg Jensen isn't quite right. That's because she's crazy. That means crazy in the head. That's because her father always beats her all the time. He beats Mrs. Jensen, too. Mrs. Jensen is very sick right now, so I guess he isn't beating her. And Ingeborg isn't crazy. It's just that she's not quite as smart as we are, that's all. Arnold didn't know about Ingeborg not being right until I told him. Maybe somebody had to tell you, too, Selma, before you knew. I suppose so. Yeah, see? Who's that? Hello. Can we give you a lift? Oh, no, thank you. I'm really enjoying the walk. You're new here, aren't you? Yes. Oh, I'm sorry. It's not a matter of curiosity. You see, I'm Nels Halverson, Editor of The Spectator here in Fuller Junction. And when a stranger's seen walking in this part of the country, well, it's news. Oh, how do you do, Mr. Halverson? I'm Viola Johnson, the new school teacher. First to eighth grade. Well, that's wonderful. Meet one of your pupils, Selma Jacobson. How do you do, Selma? Hello. I'm 5. Oh? Oh, this is Arnold Hanson. They're cousins. Hello, Arnold. Hello. Going any place in particular or just walking? Oh, I'm on my way to the Faraassens and then the Jensens. That's quite a walk. Better let us take you. Do you think there's enough room? Oh, sure. Come on, get in. All right, I will. Stand up, Arnold. Don't mind holding a young man on your lap, do you? I think not. Shucks. You know, Miss Johnson, it always makes a much better item to carry a little human interest along with our news. Such things for example as, well, where does our new school teacher come from? Milwaukee. And then it's always proper to add something like this: When asked how she likes Fuller Junction, Miss Johnson said... But Miss Johnson doesn't like Fuller Junction. And you wouldn't quote what she'd have to say. Oh, that bad? Well, among other things, it's awfully small. So's a diamond, Miss Johnson. Tell me, what is there in Milwaukee that you can't find right here in Fuller Junction? Well, Milwaukee's a city. It isn't dull. There's concerts and lectures and theaters. Good magazine stands. There's too much activity for life to ever get dreary. Well, if that's what you wanted, why'd you come here? I had to, Mr. Halverson. It was no choice of mine. I'm studying for my Ph.D. in education. One of the requirements is a year of practical teaching. My parents are Norwegian. And when the university heard I spoke the language, I found myself on the next train for Fuller Junction. End of the year, I go back. It's as simple as that. Norwegian, eh? Well, we do have something in common. Why is everybody here Norwegian? Well, because most of the people came here from Norway, like Miss Johnson's folks. But why do so many Norwegians come right here? Well, because Wisconsin is a country of green hills, pine trees, deep lakes, and many rivers. It reminds them of the homes they left behind. But they're not Norwegians anymore. They're Americans. My pa calls me jente mi. That's Norwegian. That means "girl mine." My pa just calls me. This is your stop coming up, Miss Johnson. If you have any spare time, I'd like to show you some of the things around Fuller Junction you can't find in Milwaukee. I'm going to have plenty of that spare time, Mr. Halverson. I'll be glad to accept that invitation. Here we are. The Faraassens live the first house on the left. Thank you very much. I've got a couple of stops to make myself. But if you'd like, I'd be glad to stop by the Jensens for you. It's on the other side of the Faraassens, so it'd be your last visit. I'll accept that invitation, too. I'll deliver the kids now. Good-bye. Good-bye. Bye. Bye. Everybody out who's having egg pancakes. Thank you very much, Editor. You're welcome. Good-bye. We're home, ma. Ring the dinner bell. And then you and Arnold go wash. All right, ma. You should let me pull it. Why? 'Cause I'm the guest. But you always pull it when you're here. That's because I'm always the guest. Well, all right. Whoa. That's enough. Come on. I'll pump for you first. Ok. That's too hard. I'm sorry. Now you pump for me. Your face, too, Selma. But I didn't touch anything with my face. All right. Yoo-hoo, pa. Yoo-hoo, jente mi. We're having pancakes for dinner, pa. Oh. With honey. Well, that's fine. You love that, don't you? Whoa. Pa? Ja. Red squirrels are bad, aren't they? Oh, I don't know if they're so bad. But they eat crops and steal birds eggs and Rob farmers, don't they? I never saw one stealing birds eggs. Of course, they do eat. But then I never really minded a red squirrel getting himself a square meal off my place. Why, jente mi? What's the matter? Oh, pa, but I just killed a red squirrel. She picked up a rock, and she killed him dead. Yes, but you really didn't mean to, Selma. But it isn't what you mean to do, pa. It's what you do. Well, there's enough trouble, jente mi, without grieving over something that can't be helped. Come. Here. Now, I've, uh, I've got something in the barn that I think you'll like. It's a... It's a present. For me? Mm-hmm. What is it? Well, it's something new. Something that just came. Jeepers. Is it really my calf? My very own? Your very own. And I can take care of it, too? Well, if a girl has a calf, she has to take care of it. Oh, pa, I'm so happy. It's good to be happy. Pa, do you think when I was killing the squirrel, the calf might've been born just about then? It probably was, jente mi. How's that calf going to ever get dry if she keeps on licking it? Dinner! Come on, Selma. Egg pancakes, Arnold. Sure is wet. That's too big a bite, Arnold. Uncle Martinius takes big bites. Well, your uncle Martinius has a big mouth. Do I get to feed my calf tonight, pa? Well, you'll have to wait 3 or 4 days. And then we'll teach it to eat out of a bucket. Jeepers, it's nice to have a calf all your own. If I had a calf, it would be bigger than yours. Only I haven't got a calf. Well, neither has Selma, really. I have so. Pa said I did. Sure is funny how I keep on not getting a calf. What Selma's pa meant was that it was just pretend her calf. But pa didn't say it was pretend. He said it was all mine. Well, everything on the farm is all yours, Selma, yours and ours. The things that keep us warm. The food we have. It couldn't just belong to one of us any more than the sunshine or these pesky flies. I'm sure that's what your pa meant, isn't it, Martinius? Well, that may be what I meant to say, but I did tell her it was all hers. Well, maybe your mother's right, Selma. Maybe we ought to kind of figure it like she said, instead of what we spoke about. Land sakes, Martinius, you can't take it away from her if you gave it to her like that. Maybe it's a good thing. I think your pa's right. She needed something to take care of. She'll have work to do, just like a grown-up. I wonder if that calf knows who he belongs to? More pancakes, Martinius? No, no thanks. Well, I'm going to take a nap. Then I'll go to town for a load of salt. Oh? Might stop off on the way to see Bjornson's new barn. Want to go with me, jente mi? Oh, yes. Can Arnold come along? I got to go home. I'm catching rats in the barn, and I got to take care of my trap line. My pa gives me 2 cents a rat. Well, they tell me Bjornson's new barn is as near rat-proof as you can build them. Oh, Bjornson's barn. The way you men talk about Bjornson's barn. And Mrs. Bjornson wanting an inside water closet for the last 10 years. Well, you can't have everything at once, Bruna. No. But I'll bet there are times when she wishes she was a cow. You know, you'd be walking around with your chin up to here if we had a new barn. Up to here in debt. Now go on. I want to clean up. And don't get any ideas about barns. Well, be mighty nice to have a new barn. Those were fine pancakes, Bruna. Oh, ja. You know what, aunt Bruna? What, Arnold? The traps you set like this. And the little old rat comes sniffing along like this and... bang... kills him dead. Oh. Bye, Selma. Bye, Arnold. Good-bye, aunt Bruna. Good-bye, Arnold. But even if you are a little larger than some of the children, that doesn't matter. You and I'd be the largest. We could work together. Oh, I couldn't do that. Oh, come on, Ingeborg. Let's go over here and sit down. Don't you want to come to school? I got trouble, Miss Johnson. That's because I'm not right. You wouldn't want me. Oh, of course I would. Sit down. Tell me, what would you really like to do? I see things sometimes. Early in the morning before anybody's up, I see them. You know what I see, Miss Johnson? Tell me. I see colors. Big yellows. Right out of my window before he's up. They come down like clouds and they melt. And then blues come. And the other colors with... With presents in their hands. And they're all for me. Ingeborg, if you come to school, I could give you paper and paints. And you could paint all the things you see. Wouldn't you like that? Paint? Yes. All colors. And you could put them on paper with a brush. Oh, I... I couldn't do that. I don't know how to do that. But you could learn. Maybe... Maybe I could. Yes, I... I could learn. We'll do it, Ingeborg. You'll paint beautiful pictures. Who's making that noise? Who are you? Oh, I'm Miss Johnson, the new school teacher. I was just talking over her work with Ingeborg. School work? Yes. She ain't going to school. She's crazy. You ought to know that by talking to her. Besides, I need her. But she wants to go to school. No, I don't. Now you get off of this property and don't come back. There's a school law in this county. I'm going to... I know my rights. Now get off the place. Trouble, huh? I've just had a sample of your rural life, and I don't like it. You'll find plenty of Jensens in the city, if you just look around. I'm afraid you're running into life for the first time, that's all. It's a shock to find out they're not all perfect, isn't it? There it is. Now, there's a barn, jente mi. Jeepers. Gud dag, Martinius. Gud dag, Mr. Bjornson. Gud dag, little Selma. Gud dag, Mr. Bjornson. Gud dag, Ganda. Gud dag. We're going to town for a load of salt. We thought we'd stop by and have a look at your new barn. Oh, ja, ja. Well, come on, come on. Thank you. Ah, fin, fin. Ja. To have a big barn, Martinius, is a fine thing when a man is old. But to have it paid for... Ah, it's hard to believe a man could be so lucky. Paid for it to the last truss way up there in that hay mill. Oh, no, it's not luck, Mr. Bjornson. You worked hard. Ah, everybody works hard. Now come on, come on. We go inside. Ahh. Still smell the new wood. No finer smell on earth. Ja. It's a good smell. It makes me see home. When I smell new wood, I'm a boy again. Were you a boy for very long, Mr. Bjornson? Not long enough, little Selma. Not nearly long enough. Oh. Ja. Sign painter came through. Fellow from Kenosha. Ja? I guess it's foolish, but I always did want to have nameplates for each cow. Now I got them. Well, this place must've cost you a lot of money. All I had. Mmm. 50 years. But I got my barn. Oh. There's the queen. A real champion. She's good. Ah, girl. Gosh, she looks fatter than judge Henderson. Yes, she sure does. She's going to calf in the spring. Yes? Who's the sire? Hannibal of Well Springs. Hannibal of Well Sp... Tsk, tsk, tsk. You're going to have a cow much better than Wisconsin Queen. Maybe. But somehow I kind of hate to have a better cow on the place than the queen. Yes, I guess I know what you mean. Well, Selma. This is a beautiful barn. Hannibal of Well Springs. Do you want a new barn, pa? Every man wants a new barn. Then I'll pray for one. Oh, that's fine. Only it'll take considerable praying, jente mi. Gosh, what's one more barn to God? Ma? Hmm? Why don't you want pa to have a new barn? I'd like him to have a new barn, Selma. I'd like anything that makes your pa happy. But new barns aren't easy. Sometimes they take too much out of a man like your father. But if you'd like him to have a new barn, why do you always talk like you didn't? Well... What you'd like people to have and what people are able to have, those are two different things. Right now, your pa's out in the barn mending harness, when he ought to be here with us getting some rest. With the old barn, he works more than any man should. To pay for a new one, he'd be working longer. He'd never be able to stop a minute. Just growing old and dreaming at night of his debts. No, it's better, Selma. It's better never to have a thing than to have it and be afraid. Some of these days, when you're older, you... Shh. It's your pa, isn't it? Well, that's done. Why don't you sit here, Martinius, hmm? No, Bruna. This'll be all right. Ahh. You ever see so many stars? Pa, do people live on the stars? They do if you want them to. Why is that? Oh, 'cause nobody can tell for sure that they don't. I wonder if the people who live on the stars have free barns. Oh, of course, jente mi. Up there, every man has a big red barn and a fine herd of cows. It's guaranteed with his birth certificate. 5 more minutes until bedtime. I'll turn down your covers. All right. I guess that's why they call it the milky way, isn't it? Naturally. See the big Dipper? Almost running over with milk. Hello, Martinius. Oh, evening, Peter. Going to the grange meeting tonight? No, not tonight. Oh, just thought I'd pick you up. Well, thank you. 'Night. Good night. Why didn't you want to go, pa? Oh, I don't know. On a night like this, with a lot of people around, I... I get a lonesome feeling. Can you be lonesome with people? Sometimes. Are you lonesome now? No. But I'm people. No, jente mi, you're my daughter. When do I get my turn? They were my birthday present. You can have them after awhile. You've been saying that all afternoon. Well, I have to learn, haven't I, if I'm going to teach you? I can teach myself. No, you can't. You'll fall down. Uncle Martinius said I could have a turn. But he just gave them to me. You're a big old pig. I am not. You're a big old piggy who eats slop. I was going to let you have a turn, but now I won't. I want a turn! I want a turn, you big old pig! I want a turn! I want a turn! You give me a turn! I want a turn! Children, what's the matter? Selma won't give me a turn on the skates. He called me a dirty old pig, and he said I ate slop. Selma, let Arnold have the skates this minute. Oh, all right. Tattletale. Why don't you go home? 'Cause I want my turn, and if I don't get my turn, I'm going to tell aunt Bruna. If you do, I'll slap your face. Here I go. Aunt Bruna! What's the matter, Arnold? Selma won't give me a turn on the skates. Well, are you sure she wouldn't let you? Yes, I'm sure. Martinius. Yes? I want to speak to you. You stay right here. Selma won't let Arnold play with her skates. I told her to let him, but she won't. Well, why don't you spank her or something? I think that's your job. Oh, I can't do that, Bruna. My hand's too big, might hurt her. You better take care of it, Bruna. But you gave her the skates, and besides, I'm busy making supper. Come on. Selma. Yes, pa? Why didn't you give him a turn on your skates? I told him he could, but he called me a dirty old pig, and he said I eat slop, too. Did you say that? No, uncle Martinius. Are you sure? Cross my heart and hope to die. I'm sure. Liar. Give him the skates, jente mi. No. Unless you give him the skates, you'll have to go to bed now without any supper. I'm taking my skates, and I'm going to bed without any supper. Selma. Give me those skates. You said if I went to bed without any supper, I didn't have to give him a turn. You don't have to give him a turn. Now you have to give him the skates. Here, little Arnold. These are your skates. Selma would want you to have them as a present. Don't you, Selma? Yes. That is your punishment for selfishness. Now go to your room and go to bed. She sure is selfish. She sure is. Go home now, Arnold. Pa? Pa? What do you want? Can't I even kiss you good night, pa? Go back to bed. Where are you going? Out to the barn. This time of night? I'm going to get the bathtub. I'm going to take a bath. Oh, first, you won't eat your supper. Now you're going to take a bath. You just want to be by yourself, don't you? Something like that. Well, I'll get the water going. You can have the new soap. I honestly don't know which of you is the biggest baby, you or Selma. Martinius. Yes? I wasn't going to tell you this. What are you talking about? Oh... Nothing. It's just that there's a circus going through town tonight. Mrs. Faraassen told me they're stopping at Loberg's for hay. What time? 4 in the morning. Well, thanks, Bruna. Don't thank me. It was Lars Faraassen who thought of us. Ohh... Jente mi? Jente mi. What's the matter? There's a circus going through town. I want you to see it. I want to sleep. But, jente mi, there's a circus... Lions and tigers and clowns, pretty ladies, elephants. I'm going to take you to it. But, pa... Aw, come on now. Wake up, wake up. We're going to see a circus go through. Now... Wake up. I guess we're all right. They're not here yet. Morning, Seeger. Morning. Here they come. Where are the animals, pa? They're coming, jente mi. They're coming. But they're only pictures. Yes, but, uh, inside, there are live animals. We're very close to them, jente mi. Come, uh, w-we'll go up the road and see... See... See it all. Jeepers. Looky, an elephant. Is the elephant going to come out? Oh, he is going to come out, isn't he? He is, isn't he? Well, I don't know, jente mi. I'll ask the trainer. You stay right here. Uh, excuse me. What's the trouble? Well, I, uh... Uh, brought my little girl down to see the circus go through. Uh, were you figuring to bring the elephant out? Mmm, nope. Oh. Uh... Uh, I... I... I know it's... It's a lot of trouble, but, uh, uh, m-maybe I could pay you something. Got a sawbuck? A what? Have you got a fin? Well, I'd... I'd be willing to pay. I... Have you got $5.00? 5? Well, just a minute. $5.00? 3. You know, I... I never carry much money around with me. I... Could you, uh... Could you do it for $4.00? Brother, you've almost bought yourself an elephant. Yeah. What did he say? What did he say? He said he was always glad to show elephants to little girls. Come on. Jeepers. All right, back her out. All right, come on back. Move it. Look, pa, look! All right, kneel. Kneel. Look, look! It's skin's too big! Oh... Gee. Hold it. All right, sit. Up. All right, hold it. What a beautiful elephant. That's a good trick, isn't it, huh? Would you like to take a ride on her trunk? Well, uh, is it all right? Oh, sure, she never hurts the ladies. Get her head down. Head down. Come on down. How about it, Selma? Oh... oh, yes. Head down. Bend down, way down. Now just hold on there, little lady. We're shoving off. Ok. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's quite all right, little lady. Go on. Move up there, now. Did you see him lift me? Yes, I did. Did you like it? Yes. Bye. Good-bye. You know, you were a very brave girl. Jeepers, that was fun. Come on. Getting cold nights. Yes, maybe we'll see some frost before the sun comes up. Oh, no, it's too early in the season. Besides, you'll be back in bed before the sun comes up. Pa? Yes? This time, when I go to bed, may I kiss you good night? Yes. I'm sorry about this afternoon, pa. You know, sometimes I get a meanness inside me, like when you get lonesome. Yes, I know, jente mi. This has been about the nicest summer of my life. Well, you'll have more, jente mi. They'll be nicer. Shucks. "This is the forest primeval..." "The murmuring pines "and the moss. Mary was lost..." "Instantly..." Marguerite? Marguerite Larsen, will you stand up, please? Yes, Miss Johnson? Will you tell us the joke, Marguerite so that we can all laugh? Must I, Miss Johnson? Please, Marguerite. Well... We were talking about something Selma Jacobson said on the way to school this morning. Go on, Marguerite. Well... We were talking about Ingeborg Jensen, and Selma said wasn't it nice that Ingeborg got married and had a baby all the same day? But it was nice. My pa said so. There are lots of funny things in this world, and it's fine to laugh at them, but if you saw a little dog run over in the street, and you heard him crying and whimpering as he tried to drag himself home, you wouldn't laugh, would you? Of course not. Being hurt isn't funny. Seeing people suffer isn't funny, either. Ingeborg Jensen is a friend of mine. She's just a little bit different from us because she's been hurt... Hurt in her mind. Because of this hurt, she... she sometimes makes mistakes, and she suffers enough from those mistakes without being laughed at by those who ought to be her friends. I think Selma said a very nice thing. And now let's get back to Evangeline. The fifth line, please. Shucks. What makes a cow belch, uncle Martinius? They don't belch. They just chew their food twice. Why do they chew their food twice? Because they have 2 stomachs. Why do they have 2 stomachs? Because, uh, when the good lord began to make heaven and earth in 7 days... Pa! I'm ready to feed my calf, pa. You're late. I stayed in after school to talk to Miss Johnson. Jeepers, I like Miss Johnson. Well, it's good to like the teacher. Here. Go feed Elizabeth. Thank you, pa. You shouldn't have peeked into the window at school today, Arnold. Why? Because. Hello, Elizabeth. Here's your supper, Elizabeth. That's a good girl. Why can't I go to school? Because you're too young. Why am I too young? Just because you are. But why? Just because. Go home now, Arnold. Go home. Why? Because it's pretty near suppertime. Ok. Now... Bye. Bye, Arnold. Bye. Shucks, all's I wanted to know was why. Whoa. $694 net. That's some potato crop. That much, huh? Another year like this, and we'll be richer than judge Henderson. How much did my potato money figure out? Oh, let me see. Now, uh, you picked, uh... 104 bushels. That's, uh, $4.16. I did? Yeah, just that, and then you got exactly 84 cents bonus coming to you. I figured it all out, and it comes to just 84 cents. Oh, jeepers, pa, thanks. Well, I never. I'll bet you would build a barn with your last dollar. It's lucky the W.P.B.'s tight on lumber. You'd be out there with a hammer right now. You know, I don't know how you guess those things, Bruna. What do you mean? Well, when I went to town Monday, I, uh, talked to the W.P.B. Yeah? Yeah. They said they could release enough material for a 10-cow barn and a machine shed attached. Oh, Martinius... Well, don't worry yet. I haven't found anybody I know of who's willing to lend me the money, but I may find somebody when I go to town tomorrow. Oh, I never. Pa, are you going to town before the funeral? Yes. Pa... Hmm? Why did Ingeborg have to die, too? Was it because she got lonesome for her mother? Yes, I... I suppose that was it. But why... Don't think about the funeral, Selma. That's only for grown-ups to worry about, not children. Yeah. S-e-I-m-a. Selma. Give me a turn. All right. Well, what's that? That's a big old lion. He's eating a tiger, and the tiger's eating a wolf, and the wolf is eating a fox, and the fox is eating a rabbit. Well, what's the rabbit doing? Old rabbit, he's trying to get away. If that isn't the silliest... That's the church bell. My ma says we've all got to die sometime. How do they ring the bell so slow? The bell they ring like this, only it goes a lot faster. Maybe it just goes slow by itself when somebody's dead. It's a special trick. Does the bell ring slower for 2 dead people than it does for one? I don't know, maybe a little. Look. Poor Ingeborg. Why didn't you go, Nels? Why didn't you? Because I... I cared for Ingeborg. I tried to do things for her when she was alive. I'm not going to join a lot of hypocrites who think they can square their inhumanity by marching behind a hearse. Maybe that's why I'm not down there, too. Are you agreeing with me? No. No, there's thoughtlessness and cruelty wherever a person lives. It's just easier to find it in a small town like Fuller Junction. You know why they didn't do anything for Ingeborg. But she was lonely, Nels. They could have least have been kind to her. Is that expecting too much? They didn't understand her. You were kind to Ingeborg. Why aren't you kind to the people that didn't understand her? When you're demanding tolerance, where do you draw the line at giving it? You're being tolerant with me right now, aren't you? I'm prejudiced. I'd like to marry you. Live here, of course. Nels, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but... That's like saying I want to put you in jail. I want you to associate with dull, dreary people for all the rest of your life. I want to deny you all the opportunities of a civilized world. I thought I was saying, "let me make you happy. "Let's live where human nature is real. Let's live close to people." Funny how different the same words can sound to 2 people. Yes, it is. Come on. Aren't you ever going to leave Fuller Junction, Nels? Oh, I expect to leave any day now. But I thought... Didn't you just say... I'm going into the army. But they rejected you. Only once. I've been going to a specialist in Madison. He thinks he can fix up my old football back. You see, there's a lot of men from this town in the war. And they're going to come back with ideas. Ideas I'll need to understand if I'm going to be of use to anybody. They only way to understand them is to share in the thing that makes them. Oh, don't go. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. It's all right. It's funny. You want to stay here, and yet you're planning to leave. You want me to leave, and yet you want me to stay. It is funny, isn't it? Now you come out when you're ready, jente mi. All right, pa. Ma? What? How many days is it now to Christmas? For heaven sakes, Selma, one less than it was yesterday. Ma, can I take the store catalog with me? What for? It's a secret. Oh. Here you are. Thank you. There. Now let me button you up. You know something? No. What? Your pa broke his jackknife the other day. He did? Mm-hmm. He could probably use another. Thank you, ma. Now go on with you. Bye. Good-bye, dear. Now we'll go get Arnold. Ohh. Now come to daddy. Bundle yourself up well. Wrap that around, nice and warm. Giddy-up! Whoa. Now get out, you kids, and see Editor. Where are you going? I'm gonna deliver the cream, and then I've got to talk business. I know, I know. It's about Christmas presents. I want an electric train. That's silly. You haven't got any electricity. Well, if I get my electric train, maybe I can get electricity next year. Meet me at Loberg's when you're through. All right. Bye. Giddy-up! I don't believe in Santa Claus. Shucks, I won't either if I don't get my electric train. Well, hello, kids. Hello, Editor. Hi. Hello, Miss Johnson. Hello. What brings you 2 here this cold and snowy morning? I'm ordering Christmas presents for my ma and pa. It's a secret. Oh. Would you make out the order, please? Sure. I know you. And I know you. I bet you don't know what I'm thinking about. What are you thinking about? Nobody knows, and I wouldn't dare to tell. Why? 'Cause it will scare 'em. Ohh. I want this for my ma. This one here? Yes. "11-k." 11-k. And this for my pa. This one? Yes. All right. Mm-hmm. That's a very, very good choice. Now, let's see. Do you want this with roses or lilies? Roses. All right. One with roses. S.E.S. Let's see. Mm-hmm. Ok. Yes. Here's the money. All right, I'll take care of it personally. Thank you. We were just making up the program for the Christmas party, and you're on it. Honest? Why, I've written a story for you. And you're gonna read the story at the party. At night? At the church? Sure thing. Well, if I'm not too scared... Well, can I read it over a couple of times first? Of course. You and I will study it during recess and lunch period so you'll know it by heart. I'll put it right in here for you. Is it all mine? Is the story gonna be put in the newspapers or something? Is it for keeps? You bet. Yours for keeps. Thanks. Well, what about me? Oh. Oh, we have this for you, Arnold. All for me? All of it. Gosh, you must be richer than judge Henderson. We've got to go now. We're meeting my pa over at Loberg's. Sure is a lot of money. Sure is. Come on, Arnold. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks. You're welcome. Bye. Ahem. Now, uh, among the nicer things we have in Fuller Junction... That was wonderful, children. And now Selma Jacobson will recite a Christmas story. Jeepers. I'm scared. You'll be fine. Come on. It was tax time in Palestine, and all the people had to go to the county seat to pay what they owed. Some of them had to go to the town of Bethlehem. And among these were Joseph and Mary... Ahem... Who lived in the town of Nazareth. Joseph led a donkey, and Mary rode on the donkey, but they were getting very worried because it was getting dark, and Mary was going to have a baby. So when they got to Bethlehem, they went straight to a hotel. But the man in charge of the hotel said, "I'm sorry, "but we haven't got any rooms at all. "We are all filled up. You will have to go somewhere else." When Joseph explained that they needed a room very badly, the manager thought for a minute. Then he said, "you may go out into the barn. "I'll have the hired man throw some hay into the manger for you." So they went out into the barn. Out on the hillside, beyond Bethlehem, a Shepherd was lying there sleeping when suddenly he woke up with a light shining in his face. He saw a star hanging in the sky over Bethlehem. And on the hillside around him, he could see his sheep like little lumps of silver against the earth. And he heard sounds on the road. And looking off, he saw 3 camels with 3 riders going toward Bethlehem. The 3 men rode their camels straight to the hotel, got down from them, and went to the manger, because it was there that the star shone most brightly. There they found a man and a woman and a little baby. And they gave presents to the little baby. And then the air was filled with the sounds of angels singing. "Peace on earth," sang the angels. "Good will toward men." The mother heard it. Joseph heard it. And out on the hillside, the Shepherd heard it. The people of Bethlehem heard it. And in Jerusalem, the king heard it. Then Mary and Joseph and the little baby were left alone. Suddenly, the mother looked down at her little baby and said to Joseph, "why, look, there's a light around the head of our baby, shining soft like moonlight." Joseph looked and nodded. And then he looked at Mary and said, "there's a light around your head, too." And then the mother hugged her baby closer to her, as if she were afraid for it. And then the 3 of them listened to the song of the angels, which filled the whole world. And the baby cried. Hmm. Beautiful. Now close your eyes. Hmm. All right, you can open them now. All right. Oh, ok. This is for you, pa. Ahh, for me. Well, well. Wonder what that can be. There. Packed beautifully, too, isn't it? Ahh. My, my, jente mi. What a beautiful thing. Yeah. Mmm. Just as sharp as judge Henderson. Do you like it? Do you really like it? It's the finest knife I ever had. I never thought to have one so fine. Oh, I'm glad. Mmm. Oh. Mmm. Oh! And this is for you, ma. Oh, no! This is too big for me. No, no, it's yours. Oh, well, now I wonder what this can be. Oh, no, it can't be that. The box is much too big for that. Nope, can't be that, either. Well, maybe you better open it. All right, I will. Oh, I'm so excited. Ohh... A lamp. Oh, Selma tula... How beautiful. It's a bedroom lamp. It's for the bedroom. Mmm. Not this lamp. The other one's good enough for the bedroom, but this lamp ain't gonna leave my sight. Oh, ma. Thank you, dear. There. Now get this one. This one. It's your turn to get one now. A plush coat! Put it on now. There. There you are. Put it on. Oh. Oh, jeepers, ma! Oh, jeepers! Jeepers! Jeepers, pa! Gee! Oh, that must be Pete and Kola and all the rest of them. And Arnold! Hi, Arnold. Hi, everybody. Merry Christmas. Just look at my new coat! Come on. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Oh, thank you. I'll save that for after dinner. Merry Christmas. Well, we've got to have wine on Christmas morning. Yes. Make yourselves at home now. Oh, what a pretty lamp, Bruna. Cider for the children. I bet you don't know what I got here for Selma. I couldn't even begin to guess. Selma's roller skates. Well, Arnold... That's a very, very nice thing. It's pretty nice of my pa to make me do it, too. Well, it is. It is, indeed. Now, uh, you scoot along, and we'll give Selma the skates after I've served the wine. Here we are! Here we are! Now come on, help yourselves. Thank you, Kola. Thank you, dear. Come and help yourselves. Here, Kola. Ja? Mrs. Jensen, have some vingretal? Ja. she wants it. Even the little children now. Oh, yes, cider for the children. Here, Selma. Arnold. Is that the same batch as last year? Oh, a little bit of it. Don't spill it, Arnold. Be careful. Well, merry Christmas. To all of you. And a happy and a prosperous new year. Oh, that it'll be. Oh, I have some news to tell. I talked to the bank, and, uh, they think we should put up a new barn here. Well. When? Soon as the winter breaks. Then we drink to a merry Christmas and a new barn. Well, especially the new barn. We already have the Christmas. Oh, jeepers, pa. What are you gonna do with the old barn? Use it for storage space. Ja, you always need more storage space around a farm. And the debt? What shall we do with the debt? We'll drink to it, too. Skol. Hello. I might've known. All right, young man, you just bring that bean-shooter up here. Aw, teacher! Can I have it back after school? No. Hey, put that stuff away, will you? I'm taking you to Aurora for dinner and a show. Aurora? Why do you want to drive over there? I won't be need gas much longer. May as well celebrate and use all my a-tickets at one time. What do you mean by that? I'm not a civilian anymore. Got my papers this morning and a 2-weeks furlough. Come on, hurry up, will you? What are you going to do with The Spectator? Close it up for the duration, I guess. Of course, if I had a wife to keep it going until I got back... Will you put those things down? Come on! Let me get my things. School's out. Well... Another thaw. Spring's coming. Time to kiss the teacher. Oh, Nels, not here. Nels, there's something I think you ought to know. What's that? I'm leaving here as soon as the school turns over. Oh. I couldn't spend my life here, Nels. I'd suffocate. Honestly. There are so many things I wanna do. Well... We'll have a double celebration. We're both going away. Did we scare you, Elizabeth? We didn't mean to scare her, did we, Arnold? I meant to. We did, too! Oh, he's just teasing. I know... You like barley. Come on, Elizabeth. Here. Here you go. Here. Come on, Elizabeth. Oh, good girl. You come and get your barley. Barley's good. Come on, Elizabeth. Good girl. Good girl. Good. I'm gonna learn to ride her one of these days. Ok. She'll pitch you up in the haymow. Go ahead, try. I said one of these days, not now. Oh. Well, what'll we do now? We could play school. No. You're always the teacher. Let's play boat. We can't play boat 'cause we haven't got a boat. Well, we can play the bathtub's a boat. We can go rowing in a bathtub. It wouldn't work. Come on, let's try. All right, but it won't work. I know. See? It floats. But when we get in, it'll go down. I know. We need some boards to paddle with. You get in first. See? What did I tell you? We can push ourselves. There's Mr. Faraassen. Hello. Hello, Mr. Faraassen. We're playing boat. About all there is to do in weather like this. Can't even use a truck. Chk chk. Giddy-up. Bye! Bye. We could be explorers. I'll be Leif Ericson. And I am... I am... No, I'll be Leif Ericson. But you're a girl. But you're only 5 years old, and I'm 7. It doesn't matter how old you are, but you're still a girl. But you're not old. I can catch up, Selma. I can catch up. I'll tell you what. You be Leif Ericson. Ok. And now we're going to paddle. Ok. Oh. Will you answer that, Martinius? I'm covered with dough. All right. All right, all right. All right! Hello. Oh. Yeah, all right. I'll tell him. It's, uh, Kola. She wants Arnold to come home. Ja? Selma! Arnold! Arnold! Selma, where are you? They aren't out there. Well, they can't go far in this mud. Well, maybe they went over to the Faraassen's. I'll call. Oh, uh, uh, give me, uh, 1-n-3, Emily. Oh, hello, hello. Uh, Mrs. Faraassen? Well, this is Martinius Jacobson. Uh, have you got a couple of kids there name of, uh, Selma and Arnold? Oh? In the bathtub? All right, thanks. Selma? Selma? Selma?! What's all the hollering for? The kids went rowing in the bathtub. You call some people in town, tell them to be on the bridge. Tell them to grab the tub before it goes under. Oh, Martinius. A thing like that. Wait till I get my hands on him. He won't sit for a week. Well? They couldn't have passed under before you got here, could they? I don't think so. We came the minute we got your call. Why didn't you watch them? Why'd you let them get away like that? I didn't know. I just didn't know. I... I'm sorry, Martinius. It wasn't your fault, no more than it was mine. Look! There it is! It's empty. There they are! See 'em? Yeah. I'll do it, Martinius. I'll get them. Pete, Dave. Ready with the hook, Joe. Ok. Why did you do that? Here's another one. That's 13 nests... No, 14. I'd rather do it while you're cutting hay. Then you find mice nests with little baby mice in them. I wonder what would happen to all the meadowlarks if they didn't have anybody to get their nests out of the way during plowing? They'd all be killed, killed dead. Wild geese coming back. Just like airplanes, only they don't drop bombs. They're friendly planes. Why do airplanes drop bombs? To kill bad people. Editor's going to kill bad people. I bet he kills them all. What do you mean about Editor? He's going to be a solider. He's not. He's got a sore back. Yes, he is. My pa said so. Whoa! Better skedaddle back to the barn, kids. Storm's coming. I'll race ya. You know what would happen to a fish if he was out in all that rain? No, what? He'd be drown, drown dead. Pa, Editor isn't going to be a soldier, is he? Arnold says he is, but he isn't, is he? Yes. But won't he get hurt if he's a soldier? Shucks, they won't hurt Editor. Why, he can run faster than judge Henderson. Will he? Well, you can't tell, jente mi. It's just whatever happens. Well, why is he going? Because he thinks he ought to. But why? I don't think it's true about peace on earth, goodwill toward men if... if Editor's going to get hurt maybe. Well, uh, look, jente mi, uh... You know, these things, they're... they're awful hard to explain. Now, uh, now, you take milk. Now, milk's a good thing, isn't it? Well, it's good for calves, for children, for grown-ups, for... for everybody, isn't that so? Yes. Well, just because it's good is no reason we get it free. We have to work for it. Now, does that make any sense? Yes. Well, uh, the way I look at it, it's the same thing with peace on earth, goodwill toward men. It's good for everybody and it don't come free, either. You have to work for it. And, uh... Somebody comes along, tries to take it away from us, well, we've got to fight for it. It's that good, jente mi. So I guess, uh, that's why Editor's going. Does that help you to understand? Does understand mean I've got be glad about it? No. Well, then I guess I understand. Good. Well, it looks like I'll have to drive you home tonight, Arnold. Look at it come down. Know what kind of weather this is, jente mi? No. What? Chucker weather. Come on, get under. That's it. Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. Ohh. Did you ever notice how your mother always gets her knitting done when there's a thunderstorm? Oh, you. Your move, pa. Yeah, my move. You have me in a bad spot, jente mi. Awful bad spot. You're getting too fierce for me. I don't think I've got a move. Oh, sure you have, right there. Now you're getting fierce. Ha ha ha ha. Land sakes, now who do you suppose... Hello? Oh? Oh, sure, he will. Bjornson's new barn, it's struck. It's on fire. They'll need men to help. Oh, merciful, merciful, look. I'll go get the truck started. Come on. Here's your coat, Selma. We'll go over, too. It's too late. It's too late to do anything now. See it shoot up? Yes. All that hay burning, and horses and cattle. It stopped raining. They'll never put it out now. Ooh! Come back here! Come to me! Come with me. Come on, please! Where's Bjornson? In the barn. He's an old man. We've got to get him out. Bjornson! Get out of here! Quick, give me the gun. Got any shells? All right, now get out of here. Come on. Such a pity. What was that, ma? They're shooting the cattle. No insurance at all? No. Bjorn was going to get some, but the insurance man said he wouldn't allow hay in the loft above the stock. Bjorn said no insurance company could tell him where to store his hay. So now everything's gone. Barn, stock, hay. Everything. Hey, Selma! Selma! The poor little thing's fainted. Selma. Selma. Oh, Selma. On my lap, please. Oh. Oh, Selma, baby. You'll be all right. Easy does it. 21. That must be all of them. She'll be all right. She's asleep. You ought to get some sleep yourself. I just killed 21 pure-bred jerseys. I can't sleep on that. You did what was best. Feel better, Martinius? Yeah. You know, I've been thinking. Yeah? When the war is over, things open up again... I want to do some things to the house: Pipe water in, fix up a bathroom. See if we can't get a little electric plant. These lamps ain't so good on Selma's eyes. You could do with a new stove, too, the kind that works on rock gas. Where you figure on getting the money? We've got it. But you... You'll need that and a lot more for the new barn. I don't figure to build a barn, Bruna. I thought you had your heart set on it? Yeah, I guess I did. Guess every man kind of figures way down in his heart the one thing he really wants is a new barn. Hmm. That's mostly foolishness. I'm not so sure, Martinius. Maybe... Maybe if a man wants a barn as bad as you do, maybe he ought to have it. No. Not if it costs a price a man ain't willing to pay. I've got you, I've got Selma. Now, if I had a barn, I'd have everything. There wouldn't be anything else I'd want. I don't know, Bruna. Maybe it's a good thing for a man to want something, something he ain't ever going to get. Just to keep his interest up. You know, help him take care of things he has. Here, now. Now, Bruna... Land sakes. Look at me. Well, I don't know about you, but I'm going to bed. Well, it's nice to see who's waiting for who this morning. Here, Elizabeth. Come on, pretty girl. That's a nice girl. You're a good girl. Come on, come on. You're a pretty girl. That's a good girl. Hay is good as anything, Elizabeth. You got to work for it. You're gonna like this, Elizabeth. Oh, I love you so, Elizabeth. Selma? Oh, oh, coming, pa. Selma, we're ready for church. Bye, Elizabeth. And make his face shine unto thee and bless thee while we are absent, one from another. Amen. That concludes our service for today. But there is another matter to be taken up. And I'm going to ask our good friend Nels Halverson to tell us about it. This is going to be about Mr. Bjornson. As if I didn't know. Most of you here remember that my father began publishing The Spectator in Fuller Junction 37 years ago. Fortunately, we've never missed an issue. But next week, that record will be spoiled. I won't be here. I have here a copy of my father's first issue, published in the fall of 1907, the year of the great panic. In it, he stressed the pooling of crops and supplies in order that no one in the community might suffer from want. I'd like to read you the last part of his first Editorial. Ahem. "We are all children "by adoption of the land in which we live. "The earth is here, "and the water and the sunlight "and the labor to make it yield. "The only thing which can make a land evil "is the people who inhabit it. "If we have within ourselves a nobility "to share in times of stress and need "with those who are destitute, "then we can raise our heads with dignity "among the princes of the earth. "Then we can say with verity: "This is a good land, "and the men who live in it have no fear." Ahem. All of you here know what has happened to our good friend Bjorn Bjornson. Everything's been taken from him. He needs our help. Pa, where's Mr. Bjornson? Oh, Mr. Bjornson would be ashamed to be here. He's a very proud man. Everybody's dropping coins. Hmm. Look, it's nothing. Editor? Yes, Selma? If we don't have any money to give, can we give something else? You can give anything you wish. Then I give my 9-month-old heifer calf. But she's pure-bred Jersey. I've got papers. Martinius Jacobson, is it all right for your daughter to make this gift? Well, it's, uh, it's her calf to do with as she wishes. She says she gives it, then she gives it. Thank you, Selma. Mr. Editor, uh, I give 2 pigs. Thank you, Pete. 2 pigs. A Holstein cow. 2 ton of prime clover hay. Uh, I'll give, uh, half my silage. The damn's broke. Uh, we'd be glad to give 2 calves. 5 ton of hay. One Holstein cow, 3 years old. 30 bushel of corn. I'll give one calf. 5 ton of Timothy hay. 100 bushel of oats. I give my goat. I give my goat, and its name is Henry. Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. Uh, 11 cows, 6 calves, 15 loads of silage, and 26 tons of hay. Nels? Hmm? Do you think if I asked the school board that they'd reconsider my resignation? They might, if the reasons were good enough. Ha. It's going to be a little bit difficult to explain to them that I've fallen in love with a whole town. I'm afraid they wouldn't understand that. But, uh... Now, for example, if you'd fallen in love with one person in the town, that might be good enough reason. If it were true. Oh, it's true, Nels. I guess it's been true for a long while. But it wasn't until this morning that I understood why. Well... It looks like I'm going to keep right on publishing. Arnold? Yeah, I'm coming. Well, hurry up. Shucks. Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. We're all proud of her, Mrs. Jacobson. Just as proud as you are. Yes. Thank you. Pa? Yes? Do you still have that lonesome feeling inside of you? Hmm, no. Didn't you even have a lonesome feeling when all the people were around? No, jente mi. Trees are blossoming. Pussy Willow, too. Grass is growing. Pa, I'm growing, too. Yes, jente mi. We're all growing.
