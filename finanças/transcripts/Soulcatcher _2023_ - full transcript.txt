That's not yours to take. Take. Give it back to him. It's not yours. Where'd you find these guys? We got a woman who was kidnapped by a local warlord. He's holding her in a military base by the coast. Polish? Eliza Mazur. The girl's a bonus, but we're really after the photos she took. She was documenting the general's war crimes. We get the photos then bring 'em to Poland. - They were gonna send special forces... - But we were cheaper, of course. You know it. We'll link up with a guide once we land. He'll show us the way. Then just a quick extraction and we head home. You won't tell me who ordered this? Our guide. Easy! Hey. Hey, relax. We are friends. Looking for a village. Village? Okay, okay. What are they saying? He didn't wait. What is this? Eliza Mazur? This is Seba. - He pisses me off, too, but he's useful. - Who are you? We'll ask the questions. Let him go. Got the photos? This can't fall into the wrong hands. Stay with her. We got the photos. Mines. They'll be here soon. We don't have much time. Who will? - Who? - Give me a gun! Take cover! Get down. Harbir, you good? I'm good. Take cover! Behind you! What the fuck was that? - What the fuck's going on? - Keep it together, bro. Let's split up. It'll be easier in small groups. Harbir, with me. Me too. As you wish. I just wanted to save your friends. Piotr. Bro? Watch her. Piotr. We have to go. - Piotr. - Everything's burning. Piotr! Stop! Piotr! It's me, your brother. Stop! It's me! Fang! Go, go, go! Fang. Fang! I'm 100% sure General Yousif knows the way we came from. Do we have a plan B? Krzysztof, it's Fang. Fang! What's good, man? Nothing. Come get us. - Well, crap on a stick! When? - Right now. Now? I mean... Uh... Anything for you, Fang. It's just now is kinda... Krzysztof, now means now. Don't tell me you're with clients. Send me the GPS. Help is on the way. Follow me. What are you doing? I'll skip the sightseeing flight. How do you plan to get on out of here? I don't. You've got the photos. You don't need me. You've got your mission, and I've got mine. We can distract them. Fang, we gotta go. See you later. Come on! Should that come out? It's supposed to be fine! - Nice. Just like a movie. - We paid for this trip! Now! Go now! Give me your hand! You didn't mention there'd be an entire freakin' army. Not so bad after all. I can charge double for this kind of experience. Welcome to Poland. - Interpol. - Get down! Hands behind your head. Don't move! Robert Kieł. Code name... Fang. How original. Special forces, a few medals, three tours in Iraq, "Risked his life to save..." It's that friend of yours. You were saving him. Krzysztof Bielik acted on my order. I lied to him. He thought it was only a sightseeing flight. Your noble gesture won't accomplish anything. Krzysztof was using a suspended license. But there is one thing you can do... to help your friend and, by extension, yourself. Hmm? All of them are ex-military like you. Special forces. Suspended, demoted, discharged. Some of them accused of very, very hideous war crimes. - I was never discharged. - No. You got a medal and simply resigned. Why, out of curiosity? They didn't pay you enough? What do you want from me here, man? NMP. All of them took part in the assassination of two MPs. Officially, these were unrelated acts of cruelty. You know, some maniacs with PTSD. But I know who hired them. NMP. They're all dead. They'll kill you, too, as soon as they no longer need you. You're talking to the wrong guy. I want to help you. But if you don't want my help, then... This is ridiculous. I'm going to have you all demoted for this! Are you running a goddamn circus here or what? What little game are you playing now? You put handcuffs on a war hero? - But Minister, sir... - Get those off of him! We'll talk again, Fang. Ha. Come with me. I'm sorry about these guys, really. That's shit luck. Falling into those bureaucrats' hands. They should stick to pushing papers around and leave the soldiers alone. Where are we going? We need to talk. Oh, where is Piotr? You ordered the mission. What about Piotr? Piotr is dead. I'm sorry. Keep an eye on them. Yes. Soulcatcher. - Crap on a stick! - That's the name we assigned it. It was produced in Poland. - A lot of corpses. - Unfortunately. It was an accident. So they say. The device was part of a medical experiment. It was meant to treat cancer through the use of experimental technology. The initial tests were very promising. This man here could tell you more. Professor Witold Mazur. He was the team leader, the device's creator, and current right-hand man of General Yousif Bashir Mammadov. Mazur. Eliza's father. That's what she was doing there. She wants to persuade her father to come back, to show him just how the general intends to use this device. But according to our information, Professor Mazur knows perfectly well what he's doing. In fact, he changed the device's parameters, and he alone is responsible for the death of nearly every member of his crew, apart from Eliza, who was his assistant. And it goes without saying... This super weapon is extremely dangerous in General Mammadov's hands. What do you propose? Officially, nothing. We can't interfere in the internal matters of a foreign country. However... However... if... someone wanted something really, really badly, and that someone happened to be armed, a miracle could happen. Nice bike. I know. A piece of crap, but it runs. Talkin' bout me Storm, huh? Sat Sri Akaal. Can we talk a second? Ania's done with all of that. Right? Natka, I... Where's Piotr? For how long will you disappear? You promised me. You know what this means. Piotr was a very good friend. Jarek, I need your honest opinion here. I asked the others, but you know how it is. Most of them can't tell quality product from trash. If I'm to launch my own brand, I need to be certain that my shit is the best. Jarek... Hey. Hey. Storm. Kinda looks like you. Maybe you should adopt her? Were you gonna drink the whole fucking bottle without us? - How are ya, Bull? - Oh my God! Hey. Hey, Bull. My old man would always sing that when he was sad. - He's with us. - Hi. I'm Harbir. Hi. Bull. Nice to meet ya. - All right? Are we drinking? - Down ya go! - Yeah, I need one. - Like always. - No, enjoy, guys. I'm okay. - Sure, man. Respect. But you should have something to drink at least. For Piotr. To remember him. Why do I always get the smallest glass? Well, small but mighty. Oh, I like that. Say a few words? Piotr was... Let's just start drinking, yeah? Cheers. All right. Pour me another one. Disgusting, ugh! Mine's better. - No way! - Take it! Take it. Trust me! - Ready? - Yeah, ready. Ah! Three, two, one, go! Argh! You have two goals for this mission. First of all, get ahold of Soulcatcher, and once you have it, then transport it back to Poland. Why not just blow it up? I agree with you. That would be safest, but, uh, I've consulted with our scientists on the matter, and they're saying if they rework the device, perhaps it could heal again. Right. Come in. Allow me to introduce you all to, uh, Sergeant Damian Prochyra, an experienced soldier, uh, a veteran of many missions, and an expert in fields such as field comms and explosive ordinance. Sit down. Pilot. Now, the second task is the elimination of Professor Mazur. He created it once. What's to stop him from building it for someone else? I'm afraid it's a risk I'm not willing to take, you understand. And Yousif? Uh, unimportant. He'll soon be replaced by another psychopath general with a strange mustache. But, of course, if it just so happens the opportunity arises to eliminate the general without jeopardizing the main objective, then so be it. Time's running out. Mere moments ago, I received a report that the general plans to sell the weapon to a certain ruthless African warlord and that the buyer is already on his way to the General's base hidden in this abandoned prison. Presumably, he'll arrive tomorrow. So it's on us to respond quickly and to prevent this transaction. Any questions? The most important one. What are we flying? I think you'll be happy. Storm, status. I think I've just found myself a comfy spot southwest of your position. We're gonna need eyes in the sky. Roger that. Mosquito is coming. So this was your escape plan? Like yours was any better? We were just sightseeing. Looking around. Heard there's a military base nearby. Must be beautiful this time of year. Who's this guy? You know him? Eliza, what the fuck is going on? - Who are these people? - It's okay, Louis. They're friends. Kinda. You're free now. - But we're taking the truck. - You can't just take the truck. Why? Because they're expecting us. They called it in just now. What's it to you? Yousif's keeping my father there. - I'm getting him out. - Mm-hmm. So you're gonna waltz in there and say, "Good morning." "Would you gentlemen kindly let my daddy go"? Well, you need me, like I need you. Bravo team in position. Over. Hi, sweetie pies. I can see you. Are you fucking kidding me? Professor. Is my weapon working again? Professor... Don't touch me! - Fuck you! - Wrong answer. Dad! Honey? Oh, honey! What are you doing here? What are you doing, huh? Baby. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Your daughter's just as whiny as you. Enough. The device, Professor. Is it working? You really don't understand, do you? See, I have a good friend. He'll be here soon. And he wants to pay good money for this. But why should he pay me if it doesn't work? This is your assistant, right? - No. No. Please! - No! Please. Please. Please! - I will do it! - No! No! Sorry. You were saying? Fix it! It works! It works! Please! - Show me. - Please! Please! Calibration maybe. Show me! One moment! Okay. Fang? Harbir? What's going on in there, you guys? Over. Weird interference. What they're doing up there, hmm, it's frying the electronics. What is this? It's... it's the calibration. I swear I can... I can fix it. I... I can fix it. They're here. If you embarrass me in front of my friend... Yes. Take her. How are you, my friend? How was your trip? Fine. We are ready. Professor? Yes. Yes. Hey, I can't see shit, you guys. I think comms might be down. Can you hear me? Super easy to use. Modern interface. You just plug it in and, uh... Nice show. You have good actors. Really good. They're not acting. Prove it! Him! With the glasses! Of course. Nice. I'll pack it up for you. Real nice. Alpha, it's Bravo. We've set the charges. We're moving out towards the evac point. Over. Alpha? Relax. No! No! Hey. Got eyes on the doc. Waiting for a clear shot. Do you copy? Over. What is this? Why'd you do it? A Pole? You got the order, right? Go ahead. Kill me. Shoot me like a dog 'cause I'm worthless. But my daughter... I'm begging you. That's it. Just a bit more, sweetheart. Just a bit... It was a breakthrough. A leap forward in curing cancer. Someone turned up the power and everything went wrong. - So you decided to make some dough? - Of course not. They kidnapped me! Since then, I only dream of one thing. Destroying it! Okay, guys, I've got a clear shot. Over. Just now, I had no choice. - Fuck, Fang, answer! - I had no choice. Oh, fuck it. I beg you to save her. I've got money back home. You'll get all of it. I'm begging you! I won't hurt you. No, no! Please, please! No, don't! Fang, what the fuck are you doing there? I know what I'm doing. Stay here. Wait for me. Okay, Storm. Easy now. One more time. Thanks. Come on. Harbir, are you there? Harbir, are you there? Eliza's with me. Target eliminated? Get Eliza to the evac point. Meet you there. Okay. Fang, they're wrapping the package. Storm, they're coming for you! - Finally. - Hmm. Huh? Thanks, Krzysztof. Pleasure's all mine, sweetheart. Eliza, come! Hide, hide, hide, hide! Shit! I'm out of bullets. Harbir? Hey. Nice girl. We gotta go. Come on. Yousif! Who are you? Who let you mess with our business? Are these people here part of your business? Watch out! - I've got everyone! - Drive! Do you like it? - Stop! I'll give it to you! - This is what you did to them! Fang! Fang! Wait! It's me! - You... - Just breathe. Dad said you were on the edge of the blast radius, but you're not gone. You're not! It's just adrenaline. It'll pass. That means Piotr could've survived. No, his dose was too big. Don't think about it. Just relax. Easy. Sh. Sh. I guess you started the party without me. - You're not coming. - What? I have to take your father, but if you come with us, you'll get arrested too. You go with Harbir. There's a safe house where you can stay. Harbir, take her. - Come. Let's go. - Dad! Eliza, let's go. Maciej, send me the recent chopper authorizations. ACCESS RESTRICTED NO ACCESS Excellent work! Elimination wasn't necessary. Besides, he says he's innocent. Hmm. And you believe him? I believe that he deserves a fair trial. Yes. Yes, of course. Go make sure that the professor is kept safe. Do you know the reason why I excel in politics? Because I know people. I know who they are, what they want, and what to expect from them. - I also know who I can trust. - That's admirable. I wouldn't trust me. This was mission impossible, and yet... you pulled it off because you're good. I've always believed in you. There are difficult times ahead. Everyone knows it. Our country will need people like you. Look. Beauty and the Beast. No souvenirs. It's deleted. It's in the cloud. So, you're a soldier? No, I'm a fucking ballet dancer. You could have a better job. Are you gonna keep talking, or get me a fucking medic? Maybe we should destroy it and not take the risk. So many people died because of this device. Many will also be saved by it. Maybe. No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! Get off me! - I knew it. I fucking knew it. - Fuck me. Think about it. For the first time in history, we're the ones who have a weapon, a powerful weapon that no one knows about. Do you really think that destroying it is the best solution? Join with us, Kieł. Fight for an idea. The idea of our nation. The professor will be kept with his invention. He might be useful. It was supposed to heal! You're crazy! Decide. Are you with us? Jan Zaręba. You're under arrest on charges of conducting illegal military operations in Poland and abroad. Patriots! Serve your country! Wasn't this a peacekeeping operation? Wait! I'm on your side. Shoot! That's what you're paid for! Krzysztof! - Let's go! - Eat my lead, motherfuckers! Fang. Fang! Fang! Kieł, wake up! Disinfectant. It's the best surgeon I know. I've set up everything. No one's gonna know they're here. They found us here. I'll take him. Fang! Fang, wake up! You gotta help me out. Get in! I won't leave the dogs! Fang! Fang, everything's gonna be okay. - Bull... - I'll see ya later. Go, go, go! Bull! Morning, sweetheart. How long was I out? For two whole months. Argh! Ooh! Where are Krzysztof and Bull? Keep it together. Four days after announcing his candidacy, Jakub Olech, an ardent opponent of NMP, murdered his wife. The autopsy revealed that he killed her using his own hands and teeth. Two weeks later, a student protest. Until 8:30 p.m., the young students were singing songs and walking about. Then at one point, without any escalation, a group of students showed enormous aggression. They killed two police officers, injured several dozen... Enough. I get it. Let's not forget this. This man... is a terrorist. I mean, how else would you describe a monster who infiltrates our armed forces with only one goal in mind... to murder. To savagely slaughter soldiers of the Polish army. - Do we know his motivation? - Officially, no, we don't. We're still searching. But you don't need to look very hard at the case to see which foreign adversaries benefit from this. If it helps, they're targeting me too. - What does he want? - To be the savior of the nation. To make people see him as a protector against lawlessness and foreign influence. Judging by the polls, he's doing well. I need you to give me a secure line. Harbir. I sent my father an encoded message. Now we wait. Jan has people everywhere. He'll just move the Soulcatcher somewhere else. So, what, my father's supposed to die there? I'm working on it. You know, when someone wants something really badly and that someone happens to be armed... A miracle. Mm. I let that fucker play me like a fool. He tricked everyone. Even worse. What? You want me to save your dad, right? Witold replied. But there's a problem. The message is gibberish. - Something about does at a forest. - They're coordinates. Each word is a digit. You just put together the page number and word order to spell it out. So why "Bambi"? Dad used to call me that. Here. It's some kind of factory. Anybody need a one-armed bandit? Your girlfriend would kill me. - If I know her, she's already planning to. - Exactly. So I have nothing left to lose. I think you actually do. Say hi to Damian if you see him. I underestimated him. It was a distant shot, but he hit Krzysztof between the eyes. I'll say hello. More than one person Won't accomplish anything. I won't let him go without me. Harbir, it's my fight. Not without me. It's planned that way. A one man-job. Okay. Don't fuck it up. Everything you wanted is in the trunk. My people can drive you to the agreed spot. - After that, you're on your own. - The way I like it. Don't shit your pants. Don't look at me. I knew it was you. And? Eliza? She's safe and sound. Relax. They tried to study it. But these idiots just ruined it. They tried forcing me... to fix it for them. But that'll be the day. I have this. Can you? Come on. Stay close. Watch out! Fang! You're all alone. We burned that dumb giant up with his dogs. And that other one... "Crap on a stick." That guy pissed me off! And how's your brother, huh? I heard he went crazy! Go, go, go! Is it true what they say? That you killed him yourself? Your very own brother. Boom. Cain and Abel. No! No! No! I know you're there. You hear me? Ah, I'm impressed. It's a shame you have to die. Oh yeah? But you know how... ...this will end. No, no, no, no, no! Please don't do it! Press the button. Go right ahead. Blow it up. I don't need it anymore. I've already gotten what I want. People are afraid of terrorists, of foreigners, of refugees, of their neighbors. Even of themselves. And what do they need? A leader? Protection. Safety. I've changed this country. As for your little stunt here... "Dangerous terrorist apprehended in pharmaceutical factory." Sound good? Will it bump me up a percent? You've always been one step ahead, huh? I just have one more question. Could you guys hear me all right? We heard everything. Loud and clear. Fuckin' A. So you fucked it up, huh? Come on. We gotta go. Fang? Fang! Come on! - Easy. Easy. - Oh, wait! Wait! Let's go. Okay, drive. Drive. Let's go! Don't take me home just yet, all right? These crazies will find me there. No worries. With me, no one will ever find you.
