One afternoon last May, my life veered from its day in, day out course, and became, for a while, the kind of life that can be told as a story. One of us betrayed the rest and set off a series of events worth telling. It's true. It's just a simple fact. I'll give you an example. You see Tommy Ball over there? Yeah. He's a homosexual. Get out of here! Tommy Ball? Well, look at his pants and that jiggle in his shoulders. He's co-captain of the baseball team. Yeah? And yet, he's always patting the pitcher on the butt. Lucille, they all do that. Never mind. He's one for sure. All right, well, how come you're the only one that sees it? I see lots of things no one else sees. Well, then come watch me coach Little League this afternoon. I can't. Baloney, you're just saying that because I've lost seven of the last nine games. Wayne, you know I think coaching Little League is one of the most attractive things about you. Well, all right, so after supper, I'll come over and we'll go down to the beach and test each other for the Latin final. I think you'd have better luck testing Laura Migo. No, thank you. Come on, Lucille. Come down to the beach with me tonight. But I intend to keep my A in Latin, and if I study with you, I don't think I will. Forget Latin. It's a dead language. You ought to be dealing with something that's alive. What? Well, what do you think? Cut it out, Wayne. Come on, I'm serious, you know. The way things are going, five, ten years from now, you're not gonna be able to drink anything, eat anything, rub up against anything. Everybody's gonna be completely immobilized. Maybe so. Definitely. Good luck at Little League. I'll give you a cookie when we get home. Mother? Mother! Mother, are you here? Dear Warren, the bus is coming and I have to run. This is not a sudden whim. I've thought it over very carefully. It's time for me to start a second life. Please tell Lucille. Helen. Hey, honey. Many fish, Helen. It's just me, Pop. Uh-huh. There's a note for you. Let me rinse off. I'm smelly. I think it's important. Where is it? Here. Well, read it to me. I believe it's personal. How do you know? Women. Your mother opens every piece of mail that comes with my name on it. Please take it. Okay. It's funny. About the time I retired, my eyes decided to retire from reading. You read this? Uh-huh. It doesn't make any sense to me. She discuss this with you? She was gone when I got home. Her car's here. Her pocketbook's here. You mean she just walked away? Took the bus. The bus? Doesn't say anything about a bus here. Well, I mean, I guess she took the bus with the change in her pocket. "Dearest." "Absolutely adrift." This doesn't sound like your mother at all. I think she was forced to write... I think she was abducted. Well, where are the signs of a struggle? Where is the ransom note? No, Pop. I don't think so. She wanted to go. Wanted to go, you say? Yes, sir. We have to find her. I don't think she wants to be found. You don't just walk out on a 27-year marriage, or take the bus out. I'm certain she's in trouble. Come on, Pop. Cut it out. Pop, listen to me. Wait. Stop! Leave me alone, Lucille. You can't drive. The police took your license away! Stay out of it, honey. You'll go to jail if they catch you! Stop! Stop! You're right. You drive. Come on. Come on. What we have to do is consider very carefully where she's apt to be. When I lose my glasses, or my car keys, that's the plan I follow. Mother's not a car key. It's definitely the plan to follow. It's this one. The name's different, but this is the one. Your mother wanted us to spend our wedding night here, but I had something further afield in mind. Good afternoon. Hey. How can I help y'all? Do you have a Mrs. Helen Odom registered? O-D-O-M? Or she could be registered in her maiden name, Helen Butler. I'm really sorry, sir. She's not here. Well, she could be registered in another name, any name. I don't carry a picture of her, but she's very, aristocratic, uh, taller than average. I'm sorry, sir. She's not here. Oh. Well, thanks for your trouble. If she does check in, would you tell her her family's looking for her? I surely will. And thank you for thinking of us. I have a hunch that she'll be at home when we get there. But we won't mention anything. No need to embarrass her. Hello? It's for you. Hello? Hey, Wayne. What? I was doing something with my father. Uh, I don't think I can. I'm sorry. I do not sound funny! I'll see you at school, okay? Bye. No more unnecessary calls, Lucille. We have to keep the line free. I can fix us something. No, thanks. This is fine. Hello? Helen! What is all this about? We'll come pick you up. If you don't tell me where you are, I'll call the police. All right, I won't. Promise. But where are you? Oh, for God's sake, Helen, we... Yeah, but... She wants to speak to you. Hello, Mother. Well, is this something feminist or is this something real? Just give me a reason. I will. Bye. She says it's been coming on for a long time. And yesterday, when she was driving you back from Powell's Hardware, she realized it was time. She says we're better off without her, anyway. Well, that's ridiculous. How could we possibly be better off without her? And she says she's in a safe place, not to worry, and she'll call when she's settled. Poor thing. I don't think she knows what she's doing. You all right? Uh-huh. You don't look all right. You don't suppose, perhaps, there's another fella involved in this? Who? Mr. Wendell in the produce section at Winn-Dixie? She doesn't know anybody, Pop. She never goes anywhere. I must tell you, I'm knocked off my perch. Completely knocked off my perch by this. Twenty-seven years. I suspected nothing. I thought we were happy. I thought we were happy, too. I doubt if she's shopping, Pop. We have to leave no stone unturned, Lucille. Your mother needs us. Yes, ma'am. A man without a driver's license is a miserable creature. Let's go, honey. Maybe we could get some help. We could hire detectives to look for her. I couldn't put a detective on the trail of my own wife. That'd be spying. Just to search for her. That's not spying. No, we don't need any outside help. We'll find her. Sooner or later, her path will cross ours. So tell us, Alberta, what kind of guy are you hoping to find on The Heartthrob Line? Well, I'll tell you, Gar, I'm looking for a man with good leg definition. Well, you haven't got bad leg definition yourself, there. You know, I've been working weekends at the crisis center all year, and they give really good advice. You ought to try them. This is not a crisis, Wayne. It's a private family matter. Your mother has been missing for two weeks. It sounds like a crisis to me. My mother is not missing, Wayne. Well, where is she, then? I don't mean to be fussing at you. I just want to help. Hey. Hey. This has been pretty rough on you, huh? You want to go down to the beach? You want to go down to the beach for a little... You smell like chicken grease. So why don't you quit feeling bad and call me? Well, somebody's been out on the golf course. Hey, Sharon. Or under a sun lamp, one. And eating naughties. Hey, Lucille. Hey, Sharon. It's about goddamn time. Parnell. I come to this place every morning to look around, I just know something's missing. The place ain't the same without you, is it, Sharon? And you got the lovely little Lucille with you. Y'all come on in here. Come in. Come in. I'll wait here. One question. Shoot. Do you know where Helen is? Yeah, I heard about that. I thought maybe she'd come here for a loan, possibly. Well, why in the world would Helen come to me for a loan? She never liked me anyway. True, but she doesn't know many people. Sorry. You might just as well put the best face on this whole scene. I mean, you have just been restored to the joys of bachelorhood. Christ, I wish Mary Nell would take it in her head to strike out on her own. Too late now, though. Once they get slack and gray, it's just too cruel to put them out in the street. Tomorrow we ought to try those outlet stores up around Columbia. She often mentions them. What's happening at the high school? Graduation. Beg your pardon? Graduation. Today's graduation day. Well, I don't understand. I'm not graduating, Pop. I didn't take my finals. Why in the name of God not? Well, they started weeks ago. Right after... Right when Mother first left, and I didn't feel like taking exams. I wish you'd told me about this. I had no idea. No idea? You haven't noticed I stopped going to school? Well, I don't want anything to interfere with your school work. Well, what did you think? That I'd just go on with my normal life? That I'd sit in some hot lunchroom and tick off multiple choice answers while my family was falling apart? I'm sorry. I guess I haven't been thinking properly. It's no big deal. I can make up my exams whenever I want. Don't worry about it, Pop. Aha. A gift for forgery emerges. Yes. Good news, Lucille. I'm learning to stop thinking about her. Well, that is good news. I simply go back before her time to, uh, the deeper memories. I remember once, my family walked to a new town. I was about five. My daddy heard rumors of a job, and we spent the night by the road in a ditch. Next morning, we followed that long black road again. There was some kind of tall grass, like wheat, blowing along the side. Every time a car went by, this grass just... Am I boring you, honey? Not at all. Every time a car went by, the grass just laid down in waves. Morning, Pop. Wait, wait. What is it? If I lie still just after I wake up, I get these scenes. The shoe department at Belk's, where my mother worked. I was in the third grade. I had to be there every afternoon at 3:30 so she could see I hadn't been killed somehow at school. I brought your coffee, Pop. Tragic figure, my mother. A woman who'd once been a beauty, kneeling in front of customers, touching their feet. We were so poor after Daddy left us. I hated him. But she'd always smile and say, "I don't see us as poor. I see us as rich in love." Okay, Pop. I'm going. Look, coffee. Rae! Hey, Lulu. I thought you'd never get here. How's the car? Oh, the mechanic said it was running like a dream, honey, but he must have been talking about those dreams young boys have, 'cause this thing's been erupting the whole way down. What's the surprise? This is Billy. How are you, Lucille? Uh-huh. I'll get the bags, honey. Hello, sweet stuff! Hey, Pop. How you doing? Pop, this is Billy, my husband. Your what? My husband, Billy McQueen. He and I got married on the way down, to Myrtle Beach. Married? Married. Yes, sir. Well, marriage is a wonderful institution. How can you say that? It hasn't been so wonderful to you. Hush, Lucille. Well, I only hope you find the happiness in marriage your mother and I were fortunate enough to have. Thanks, Pop. The coincidence of it, that's what floors me. Millions of people in the world. What's the world population, Lucille? I have no idea. It's up in the billions, sir. In the billions. An enormous throng. And out of that huge number two people come together, find each other, as if by some uncanny radar. I don't think it's radar. I think it's blindness. You love what you bump into. Oh, no, no. There's far more in it than that. Good to have you home, honey. Thanks. Hmm. 1961, clear as a bell. All those debutantes floating around in white dresses. Helen's was yellow. I said, "Are you coming out?" She said, "Not if I can help it." I couldn't stop watching her hands. They moved like music. Sheer music. Very nice to meet you, sir. Good God, Lucille. What are we gonna do? You see? You see why I wanted you home? I need a gin drink. It's certainly good to be here. He never does anything? Well, sometimes he asks himself questions, and then he waits for a second and answers them. Does Mother know? Mmm-mmm. She only called that once. But she promised to let us know if she needs anything. What a wedding day. I don't get it. Y'all, like, stopped for a hamburger and got suddenly struck by marriage? That's about it. Actually, we've been planning it for some time. How long? Let's not rehash this right now, okay? Now is not the time. I just wanted to picture it. It's not much of a picture, really. It was a magistrate's office, is all it was. I mean, I liked it fine, Billy. But Lucille's idea of a wedding is baby's breath in a bridal's bouquet. It is not. Well, anyway, we saved your father a few thousand bucks. Pop wouldn't have minded. He's big on family. You're the one that's big on family, Lulu. I don't know about that. Lately I've had this urge to quit loving Pop, you know, the way you can go down to the bank and take out your life savings. You think that would work? Poor old Lulu. We're home now. For a little while, anyway. How long did your congressman give you off? Rae quit her congressman. I thought she told you. Uh-uh. I'm gonna go upstairs. Excuse me. Pop! Lulu! Can y'all come up here a minute? Coming. Okay, truth is we're gonna have a baby. In November. We decided against abortion. That's why we got married. It's not a very original story. You're kidding. No, I'm not kidding. Now, I want y'all to do me a favor and leave me alone right now, okay? But I thought that wasn't possible nowadays, you know, with all the technology. It is possible. But didn't you... Couldn't you... Lucille, would you shut up? Now, we need a place to live till after the baby's born. Well, you'll live here, naturally. Are you sure you won't mind? Well, this is your home, honey. I went to my grandmother's house, took with me an apple, a basketball, a corkscrew, doorknob, an easel, a featherbed, a garden hose, a hamper, an ice cube, a jockstrap, a key chain... A jockstrap? It's a memory game. Oh. Well, don't let me interrupt. What are you? I'm an historian. What are you? Besides breakfast cook. A high school dropout. You want a fried croaker? A frog? A fish. See? Oh, what else is there? Stale Cheerios. My favorite food. Ah! Your husband's awfully neat. Mmm-hmm. You ought to see his underwear drawer. Everything in these perfect little rows, all folded and arranged by color. Can you imagine what Mother would say? Anal retentive. I don't understand exactly what she has against doing laundry. Or carpools. Or organized religion. That's just the way she is. You know how Pop always calls her the Duchess of Nonchalance. When are you gonna stop romanticizing about her? I mean, can't you manage to be a little bit pissed off? Why? What do you mean, why? She ditched us. You and I are abandoned children. We're not children, and she didn't ditch us. She just kind of slipped out of the family, like she was visiting and not having a very good time. You think she'll ever see my baby? Come on. She'll be back long before that. Yeah. She'll be wonderful with it. Mother loves babies. I wouldn't be so sure. What do you mean? I remember when she was pregnant with you, the abortion and all. The what? I was eight. Pop didn't even know she was pregnant. She drove up to Columbia to have an abortion. Oh, I remember being in that car. It was hot. My head fit right in the curve of her armpit. We sang along with the car radio, then she started talking about overpopulation. It was the first time I'd ever heard that word. She told me not to say anything to Pop. Wait. You're making this up. No, I swear to God. I thought you knew. I survived an abortion? Yeah. It must just happen sometime. I don't know. It just missed me? Well, yeah, there were two of you. Twins. It got one. You were the other one. They didn't know you were in there. Honeymoon brunch. Come in. Come in. Happy happy. Oh, Lulu, how sweet. Very sweet. It's our first wedding present. Thank you. Very much, thank you. Mmm. Hey, Pop! Hey, honey. Come on up. I don't think I can. Of course you can. Come on! Nothing like a roof, Lucille. The best times I had in the construction business were up top like this. The higher you get, the better it looks. Well, you're in a mighty fine mood today. I just thought to myself, "Time to get on that roof. "No reason not to." Tired of lying around. Just came over me, Lucille. Just came over me. Well, good. I could do with some assistance. Sure. Come on. Okay, come on. Ow. Right? There you go. You just pull those old nails out like that. Come on, pull on that. That's it. Rae! Rae, up here! Rae! I'm going to have to get her a maternity bathing suit. It's extraordinary. She almost seems like a different person. I've only recently begun to think of you girls as people. What did you think of us as before? Well, pets, to tell you the truth. Your mother's pets. She always had a way of keeping her children to herself. I never seemed to be able to... Be able to talk to you. I always sounded like the cartoon character Mr. Magoo. Always seemed to say the wrong thing. Perhaps if I'd had a son... I'm not saying that I wanted one, honey, but if I'd had one, I could have... Well, maybe I could have... Talked more? Exactly. Seems to be an awful lot of sex going on with those two. Hope it doesn't unbalance the marriage. Well, I suppose we better finish another time. Marriage tells you who you are. Then it's gone and you're a blank page. I mean, who would you say I was, Lucille? Am I the same as I was with Helen? Not the same? Here I am, near about a grandfather and I haven't even considered the basic questions. Like what? Good versus evil. The nature of man. Oh, those. You need some new magazines, Pop? I'm tired of magazines. I want books. Heavy hardback books. Paperbacks are a lot cheaper. I don't care. Don't want to feel I'm reading a paper napkin. Well, what kind of book are you looking for? Not book. Books, Lucille. I realized over the years I've stopped reading. Your mother, you know, is smarter than I am. She seems to know about everything. I want some books for myself. It's going to be expensive. We're rich. We have money to burn. Now, do they still have those books about mythical places? Camelot? Atlantis? Troy? Oz? Hmm. I'm gonna come back later for more. I don't want this gal to think I'm crazy. There's your mother. I don't think so. Where would she get a car like that? Helen! Pop! Come on! Let's go! Pop. Helen! Pop! Watch it! Pop, wait! Move over! Move over! Move over! Pop, are you crazy? Pop! Now the property here today basically used... Sandy. Oh, Sandy, come on now. I'm sorry, y'all. We're gonna have to give Sandy just a little bit of privacy. You can't take some people anywhere. Now the market is basically handicrafts and souvenirs. Come on. Now if you'd all like to come down and take a look at the... We need to move on, Lucille. I assume unisex includes me. Yes. You just get in under the wire. Take a seat. What have we got? Okay, drop here, and your A. There you go. Thanks. You're welcome. That's two... Cheater. Do you realize you've had four beers in 20 minutes? I've never seen a girl do that before. Well, that's the way we are down here. You aren't even shaky. I believe I'll have another one. How about a guzzling contest? Oh, Lucille. All right. Ready? Go. Mmm. Jesus! You're gonna kill yourself. Rae, how can you let her do that? Don't worry about it. It's fake. "Non-Alcoholic Brew." Hmm. Let's go somewhere. In this? Fusspot. It'll stop soon. I can't. I play honeymoon bridge with Pop every Friday night. Well, Pop can come, too. He doesn't want to, and neither do I. Lucille, you are such an old lady. Isn't she, Billy? I don't know, honey, maybe she's just not a night person. Why don't you run along with your sister, Lucille? You don't want to stay home with me. Of course I do. Well, the truth is, I've made other plans for the evening. With who? Uh, Mrs. Delmage, you know, the lady who cuts my hair. Good for you. Well, she's got a new video cassette recorder. She invited me over to watch a movie. Well, good. Rae, could I see you for a second, please? What are we going to do? About what? We don't even know this woman. She could be a gold digger or a slut or a bimbo or... Pop's right. You need to get out of this house. You've lost all perspective. All right, if you won't help, then I'll just have to do something by myself. Honey, the man's only going over to the woman's house to watch TV. Not TV, the VCR. What's the difference? Don't you know what VCRs are for? Don't you know why people buy them? To watch X-rated movies, that's why. Oh God. Come on. What? You need a makeover. Shake your head. What do you see? My clothes. Drab city. There's not one bright color in here. Your entire wardrobe is earth tones. There's no moon tones. So? Well, it's dull. You think you're so virtuous, Lucille, but it's your form of vanity. I know. Well, you should stop being so self-conscious and forget how you look. Maybe you might have more fun. Okay, I will. So, Lucille, do you have a love interest? Excuse me? Do you have a boyfriend? Are Yankees naturally rude, or do you make an effort to be that way? She doesn't have one is what that means. What about that young man, Wade? Wayne. Yeah, that's the one. He was in Gifted and Talented with you. Make a right, make a right. He's gone. Gone? Moved away? He doesn't want to see me. He's not calling me anymore. Call him. Yeah. Your mother used to call me all the time. But ours was an unusual romance, I suppose. This is no romance at all. It isn't even in that category. So call him. What have you got to lose? Oh, I think you should lay low. Play hard to get. I'm not playing hard to get. The relationship is over. Period. Nobody's calling anybody. Okay. I say don't call him. Who votes with me? Forget it. We're not taking a vote. Why not? This is a democracy, isn't it? Rookery Lane. Make a right. I don't know why everybody thinks my private life is such a joke. Seven-six-two. Thanks muchly. Hi. Oh, what time do you want to be picked up? Oh, I'll run him home. Don't worry. Oh, well, thanks. If we aren't back yet, he can just go on in. I left the light on and there's a key... Under the first step. I know all. And you're Rae, and you're Lucille. And that's Billy McQueen, newest edition to the clan. Night-night. Goodnight. Bye. I got Gene Kelly for me and Ava Gardner for you. Oh, Lord, I haven't thought about Ava Gardner in ages. Well, it's time you did. This is absolutely the best place in the world. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. God, Rae. How you been, baby? How are ya? You have a good time, you hear? Terry, hey. Rae! How are ya? Fine. Fine. Rhody, Rhody, hi. Do I see what I think I see? Oh, Rae. Hey, Lucille, baby, long time. How you doing? Rhody, meet my husband, Billy McQueen. Oh, so you're the responsible party. Oh, Rae Odom, a married woman! Come on, y'all. I'll find y'all somewhere to sit down. Come on, home girl can have my table tonight. Come on, Lucille. Now let me take y'all's order. Um, gin and tonic, and a Coke for Lucille. Beer for me. Honey, shouldn't that be two Cokes? Excuse me? So he speaks. Where you from, Mr. McQueen? Land of Lincoln, ma'am. I thought so. I thought... You know, a Yankee white boy will sit up in here all night long and never crack a smile. I don't know what causes it. I think y'all must got something stuck up your... Let me get you a drink. Go easy on him, honey. At first. Well, I don't think I'd like to spend too much time with that woman. Don't be silly. She's great. Mama says she's probably the smartest person she ever met. Your mother knows her? Of course, she was Lucille's teacher. She and Mother'd sit around the kitchen and talk all the time. If she's a teacher, what's she doing working here? Honey, she doesn't work here. She owns the place. Yeah! All right. The band will take a short pause. Don't go away. Keep it where it is. Hey, girl. Hi, Tick. How are you? You got married. I heard. It's hard to believe. Girl, that's hard to believe. Jesus Christ! How you holding up, Lucille? Hey, Tick. Here you go, handsome. Rae, look over here. Vennie Alice Wheeler got herself a husband, too. And pregnant like a big dog. Come here. Oh, my lord! Come on, Lucille, let's go see. Harold Willis. Billy McQueen. Hey, Rhody say you from Chicago, Illinois. Winnetka, Illinois. I guess people today don't matter who they marry. I got a cousin that married a Vietnam, and another one that married a dwarf. Of course, now, we different down here. Yeah, how's that? Well, we got niggers. Y'all got them in Winnetka? Yeah, well, Winnetka's an Indian word. It means "no niggers." Never knew that. Mmm-hmm. Matter of fact, if one gets in by mistake they enslave him. Keep him in the back room at the country club, washing wine glasses. Well, that ain't all that different from down here. You're all right. A feast! I'm impressed. Oh, don't be. All I did was add water like it said. Easy's my motto. Anyway, it's angel food. Good for the heart. Good for the heart. One thing about living alone. I can put a $20 bill down on this table, and two weeks later it'll still be there. Mmm-hmm. You know what I mean? Nobody nosing through my stuff, moving my things around. When I was married to Buddy, I'll tell you, it wasn't worth the trouble. Only things of his in the house was magazines. Playboy, Penthouse. He had all of them. He subscribed, believe it or not. Well, that wasn't so bad. But he kept trying to get me to look at the pictures all the time. So I said, "Buddy, if I want to see a naked lady, "all I have to do is look in the mirror." You like it? Mmm. More? Why, yes. Why didn't I know about this? Well, now, Mr. McQueen, you went and married someone and didn't know what you had? Oh, yeah! What else can you do I don't know about? Swallow swords? Walk up walls? God. What? I just loved that so much. Well, we'll go back. You can sing with them again. No, I can't. I'll be too big. After that, I'll be too many. Putting your coffee in your room, Pop. Thanks, honey. Uh, did you have fun last night? Sure. Glad to hear that. You were out pretty late. Oh, I was? Oh, didn't realize. Oh, by the way, uh, I won't be here for dinner tonight. Mrs. Delmage? Mmm-hmm. A little Vietnamese place she's heard about. Okay. Mercy. Hmm. Rae, Pop just... I wouldn't come in here right now if I was you, Lulu. Oh, God! What? Would you look? Here. Hmm. Nice. It's not nice. I'm oozing out of all my clothes. Oh, I like that. Would you leave me alone? Shit! Look at the moon. It's all broken up and shining in the water. I love the moon. Yeah, it's a nice night. What are you doing here? Getting some air. You got a problem with that? I thought you were Wayne. Wayne? As in "not even in the romance category" Wayne? Yes, I meant that. Mmm, I don't know, Lucille. Moonlit night, music drifting out over the water. Mmm. Is Rae okay? Sure. I heard her crying before. Yeah, this is a lot harder on her than I thought it would be. She isn't used to being two people. She was brought up to be herself. Well, she'll get better once the baby's born. You know, I'm starting to like it down here. It's like Lake Michigan, only wilder. This place is crawling with critters. I love it here. I love the live oak trees, the sag in the verandah, Pop's lawn mower. I never want any of it to change. You are strange, Lucille. Well, which aspect of my strangeness are you referring to? You come on so tough, like you had to defend Fort Sumter single-handed. And in your next breath you're telling me how much you love lawn mowers, and yard sales, fried croakers. You do that all the time. I do? Mmm. You got a lot of love in you, Lucille. Well, guess I'm gonna head back in. You make good use of all this moonlight, now. Go away. I'm going. I'm going. You having an asthma attack? I'm breathing deeply. It soothes the soul. Hi. You didn't come straight from the crisis center. You went home and took a shower. You put on a clean shirt, too. You smell good. So do you. Come on. Hey. What is it? What's wrong? Did I hurt you? No. Everything's fine. Okay, it was the first time. It gets better. Really it does. I mean, it's... You know, not that I'm an expert or anything, but every time you do it, it gets... Don't. It was fine. No, it wasn't. I can tell. I mean... I'm sorry. No, I'm not sorry. Damn it, Lucille! Every time something bad happens, you make me feel like it's my fault. This was your idea. You planned this whole thing right down to the candles. And if it didn't work for you, that's too bad. It's just too bad. I've had it, Lucille. You know, I give up. You have no idea what love is. Your idea of love is a total error. It's like 360 degrees off. You mean 180. Yeah. I'm not the girl for you. Yes, you are. You just don't want to be. Lucille. What? Uh, don't call me. I have a lot of love in me! Mmm. Ah, Lucille. Hey, Pop. Hey, Mrs. Delmage. Listen, I know you were raised right and you got manners, but I'd just as soon be Vera if you don't mind. Delmage was Buddy's contribution, and he's pretty much old news. Aren't you up early? Aren't you? Well, I better be on my merry way. No rest for the wicked. Uh... Maybe you'll come to dinner one night, Vera. Well, yeah. By all means. Lucille has a gift for guacamole. Deal. And I'll tell you what. I'll stop at the Pick-a-Chick on the way from work. Who needs to cook in this weather? 8:00 okay? Perfect. So long, Lucille. Bye. And you, trim those toenails before you do serious damage to somebody. Oh, I had this customer, Mr. Marlon Powell. Came in regular for a trim in the back and neaten up the sideburns. Always had on a coat and a tie. Then he stopped coming in, just like that. Six months later, this woman comes prancing in. Lots of beads, fussy little outfit. And I looked at her and she said, "Yes, it's me. "But I'm Marlene now." Oh, my God. What did you say? "Well, hi, Marlene. "Guess you won't be wanting your usual trim." I'm sorry, Stanley. I didn't realize you were so unhappy. No one knows what I've been through, Craig. Oh, I know it's mostly my own fault, but that doesn't make it any easier, does it? Of course. You know, it's much cooler outside than in here. What am I doing here? What? I was meant for the 1940s. I would have loved the '40s. The '40s would have loved me. The clothes were good. Yeah, well, I'm not talking about just the clothes. I mean, it was a whole different world. Everything was full of purpose. You know, life made sense. I would've been a nurse in World War II. Rae, if you need anything, tell me now 'cause I gotta go. You know I'm gonna die and all my obituary is gonna say is, "Miss Odom was a lifelong subscriber to Newsweek." Mrs. McQueen. You're Mrs. McQueen. And you can join the Sierra Club when your baby's born and take it on hikes in a backpack. Great. I'll be back. Whoo! Got the job. Wando Warriors, here I come. Ninth grade history, junior varsity soccer, one section of substance awareness. Woman, get me the want ads, I'm on a roll. But you have a job. He wants to get a place of our own. Don't talk dirty in front of Lucille. Oh, my, this is one lucky little kid. Papa's about to be filthy wealthy and Mama is drop dead gorgeous. What about Lucille? Mmm. Quality aunt material. Top of the line. Mmm, look at that. They did a scientific computer map of how the coast of South Carolina is gonna look in 50 years' time due to the greenhouse effect. The dock, the beach, the very spot where we're all sitting, all blue. Covered with water. Well, then I guess it doesn't matter if I finish the coffee cake. Any objections? Let's get this out in the open. What is it? This baby business. What about it? I don't want to have it. What? I don't want the baby. Honey, you can't decide that now. Of course I can. You can't. It's too late. You're in your seventh month. I'm not gonna haul off and have an abortion. I mean, I just don't want it around. I intend to put it up for adoption. I mean, look, there's 12 ads in the personal columns today alone. "Loving couple desires white baby. "Incidental costs paid." I just think they'll deserve it more than I will. I think they'll love it more. Can we please discuss this in private? There's nothing to discuss. This is out of the question, Rae. You're keeping it and you're raising it. I just don't think I can do it, Lulu. I really don't. Of course you can. Of course she can. You think so? I know so. You took care of me. Yeah, you made her that lamb mobile. You couldn't keep your hands off her. Look, she turned out all right. Yeah, but that was just a game for me. I mean, that was only Lucille. This is a real baby. This is my baby. Don't worry. It's in our blood to mother. Pop, didn't your great-grandmother have twins in a buckboard wagon? So the story goes. See? Sort of. I don't know. Go get Billy. Y'all got a lot to talk over. I give that boy fits, don't I? Hey, Lucille. Hey, Sam. How you doing? Oh, could be more better and some worse. Gotta go. Okay. See ya later. Hi, baby. Hey, Rhody. Sam's certainly been busy. Now he got me busy sorting parts. He trying to get ready for the Spoleto Festival. Where you going? Rae's not acting right. I don't know what to do. You got to help me think of something. Billy and the doctor keep saying it's a bad case of hormones, but I don't believe it. You don't look too hot yourself. It's been pretty awful at our house. Ever since Mother left, everything has been crazy. I saw your papa at the hardware the other day. Now, he looking tiptop. Well, he isn't. None of us are. I just want things back to normal. That's all I want. Normal's a problem, Lucille. It keeps changing on ya. But I think you talking about something else. I think you still trying to get things back like they were before. Yes, I am. Is that so terrible? No, it's not terrible. But it's just unlikely. Lucille, have you ever thought about getting out of there, getting a place of your own? What do you mean? Come on, let's take a walk. Sam started to build that 'cause he thought he owned the land. Then he found out partway he didn't. But it looks nearly finished. There's a roof and all. No electricity, and no finishing inside, but somebody who had to could live in it. Not me. I need creature comforts. Girl, sometimes you are as dense as a telephone pole. Well, do you live here? Lucille, why would I do that? I don't know. Think again. Mother is living here. She finally gets it. And you one of the genius Odoms. Well, where is she? Sam went to pick her up from work. She'll be here directly. Work? Where's she working? Off that place on 17, where they got the seashells and ice cream. But that's only half a mile from our house. We've been looking all over the state of South Carolina. You didn't look there. You should have told us, Rhody. Why didn't you tell us? Ask her. Who's that? Lucille. My Lucille. Oh, baby. No, no, no. Oh, damn. Lulu, baby. You never cry. I know. Oh, come on, now. I'll make you some coffee. I owe you an explanation, don't I? Why didn't you let us know where you were? I guess I was thinking out of sight, out of mind. I figured it'd be easier if your father and I just didn't see each other. I thought it would ease the pain. You know, sometimes just seeing a face brings back too many memories. Well, it didn't work. He had the memories anyway and the pain. Him? I'm talking about me. I was afraid if I saw him I'd just go running back. Well, it's not over. Look at me. I mean, just talking like this does it to me. I thought you didn't want to see him. I didn't. I don't. But if it's so difficult... It's difficult, but it's necessary. Being married to him was killing me. Well, I managed all right until he retired. Then he was always there. He watched me make the shopping lists. He followed me around when I did the vacuuming. And then the driving him around. Oh, well. He wasn't to blame. I don't know what we could have done any differently. Anyway, it was so hard all the time. It was so sad. I was just trying to stay afloat. I figured you'd be fine, 'cause you haven't needed me for anything since about sixth grade. Yes, I have. No, you were smart. You realized early that love is more wisely invested elsewhere than in a parent. You don't plan on coming back, do you? No, baby. I don't think so. But Pop would change if you do. I promise he would. You can't make a promise like that for another person. Anyway, I don't want him to change. I love him just the way he is. Then why did you leave? Because it was so permanent. The house, the family, everything. I've been in it for more than half my life, Lucille. We've all been doing it for so long. A change wouldn't hurt any of us. Pop's way ahead of you on that. He already has a girlfriend. Oh, really? Well, that's wonderful. That's good. Well, now, is that someone that, um, he met recently or is that someone he knew? She's the... Oh, don't tell me. I don't want to know. You see? You see how much this bothers you? You have to come back. No. But why? You love Pop. He loves you. Let me put it this way. We carried love to its conclusion. Hi. Hey. Congratulations. Well, thank you. For what? I hear you aced your makeup exams. Why didn't you tell anybody? Well, you know. There's lots going on. Uh-huh. You know, when I first met you, you seemed like such a little shit. I was. I still am. Good morning. Billy up? Hey, Warren, let's get a wiggle on here! Hey, honey! Your father is the pokiest man I ever saw. Where are y'all off to? Going to repaper my bathroom. I wanted squiggles, but Warren said shells. Well, it's your bathroom, not his. Oh, what the hell. I never had any taste. Hey! You two coming or going? We just bought Rae a present. Well, that's fine. You're plain wonderful to your sister, Lucille. Plain wonderful. Okay. Wow. Rae, that's great. You look like a big jonquil. Did you tell her yet? Tell her what? We're splitting up. Well, that's impossible. After the baby, she wants me out. She hates me. She's never gonna forgive me. Forgive you for what? Love isn't exactly something you inflicted on her. Well, yeah, it sort of is. It definitely is. I did it on purpose. Oh, God, so crazy in love with her. You can't imagine. I had to have her. I don't get it. I got her pregnant on purpose. It's the only way I could get her to consider marrying me. How? Excuse me? How did you do it? Oh, Lucille. I'm sorry, I just don't get the picture. You stole her pills and substituted fakes? You raped her? What? I punched a hole in the condom. You didn't. Mmm-hmm. Once? No. How many times? Every time. For a month. But I left something to destiny. I mean, they were very small holes. How could you do that? I told you she's got a point hating me. Mmm-hmm. Oh, I swear, at the time, it seemed like such an act of love. My true self. Trick or treat. Happy Halloween. Hey, kids. Trick or treat. I got some candy for ya. They think you're a real giant cat. No, they think you're a real bum. You know, the one they're mothers are always warning them about. Beautiful place you got here. I guess I'm gonna head back to Washington after this semester. If you go to Washington, Billy, I'd, um... What? I'd, um... If you go to Washington... Lucille, I can't hear you with this stupid paper bag on your head. What'd you say? If you go to Washington, I'd like to go with you. Lucille Odom imbibing in real alcohol? It seems appropriate. What's that? It's the Lawton's cat from next door. This tastes strange. It sounds like it's in the house. Honey. Are you sick? Yes. Oh, God. It seems to me that Phoebe is the exact replica of her mother at that age. Lucky kid. Look at her fingernails. Excellent fingernails. Excellent mother. I think we should leave the little family to themselves. God, she's just the most beautiful thing. Bye. Well, congratulations, Granddaddy. You know, somewhere in this house is a little sweater my mother made for Rae. Remember, Warren? It was pink. With little white snowflakes knitted right in, little white heart-shaped buttons. Well, I just can't find it for the life of me. Did I wear it, too? I suppose. Well, of course you did. How can you not remember, Warren? We laughed all the time, 'cause when you screamed, Lulu, your face was the exact color of this sweater. I screamed a lot? Oh, please! Of course. All the time. Just like this one. And you were a vigorous eater. But you had a real mean streak. I never had a mean streak. Yes, you did. You were as mean as a bird. Well, I imagine I was just looking for attention. I'm awful sorry, Lucille. You don't know anything, McQueen. I'm sick about it. My stomach's all tied up in knots. Good Lord, you didn't do anything. Of course I did. You were had, Billy. Simple as that. I dreamed about you all summer. I watched you swim. I watched you eat. And when I saw you were off guard, I pounced. You make it sound so romantic. I thought it was pretty romantic. Yeah? I'm still sorry, Lucille. I'm not. And I imagine Rae wouldn't be too thrilled. Yeah. Probably not. Hey, Vera. Hi. It's an angel cake. It's your dad's favorite. Thank you. I can't come in. I left the car running. But just tell me, has she come home? Not yet. But she's having therapy and she's really getting well. She'll be home in a few days. Oh, Rae, you mean. Oh, good. I'm glad to hear that. Actually, I was asking about your mother. I haven't heard from Warren in a little while and, well, you know. Mother still works at the souvenir place, but, yes, she's back. I'm taking care of the baby until Rae comes home. I see. Well, kiss the little dickens for me and give your daddy the cake. Of course. Bye-bye, then. Goodbye, Vera. I thought I heard a car. Vera was here. She's gone. She just left. Yeah, but... What did... What did you tell her? You didn't tell her that your mother was here. Of course I did. Okay, let's go. Drive me to her house. We just got back to normal, Pop. Don't start it all up again. If you don't drive me, I'll drive myself! I'm sorry. I can't let you do that. Lucille, I insist you give me the keys to my own car! Pop, please. Don't do it. Just think about it first. Don't rush off now and do something you'll regret. Just let it wait. That's all I ask. Pop, please. We've all been through a lot. Well, you're right there. There you go, Pop. Pop! Pop! Baby. Baby. Hey, darling! Hi! She's so cute. I know. Hey, sweetie. Little scubber, come here. Come on. Hi. Hi. Well, I was sure I was gonna miss her. Mama, when have we ever done anything on time? Now, nobody better have taken my boxes. Oh, they're right over here, Mother. Is that all you're taking out of this whole house? I don't have much room, Warren. What, uh... What you got in there? Hi, Sam. Rae's letters from Camp Kanuga. Lucille's drawings. Snapshots. I don't know. Aw. Oh. Lord, Helen, we're not what we were. Thank God for small favors. I hear the new owner's gonna do over your whole house. Total renovation. Central air conditioning, automatic vacuuming, underground watering system, everything. Hope it doesn't collapse in the process. It won't. I think it's time for a change. I can make good use of this vacuum cleaner, if you don't mind. Sure thing, Sam. My hat's in the air to you, I'll tell you that. I wouldn't have it in me to go off to Duke University and not know a soul. Oh, Lucille will handle it. She can handle anything. Bye. Bye. Bye, little Phoebe. Say bye-bye. Bye-bye. See ya, McQueen. So long, Lucille. Take care of yourself, Pop. Oh, I'll see to that. Not to worry. Give 'em hell up there. Tell 'em who taught you how to read. Okay, Rhody. Now I want you to promise me that you stop for coffee every two hours. This is important. Bye, Mom. And call when you get there. With all these different houses, somebody's bound to be home. In the old days, family meant people in a house together. But that was in a language so far back that all its words are gone, a language we can only imagine.
