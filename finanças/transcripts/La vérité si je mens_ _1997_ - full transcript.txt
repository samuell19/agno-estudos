Shit! - You told me to load the truck... - But not with this! With that! - I am sorry. - You load that out and you load this in. You got half an hour. - Maurice, he's new on the job... You ok? - Yeah, ok. - Don't worry... We've all been through this, even him. Even though he forgot. What's your name? - Eddie. - Dov. - Hey, boy! Tomorrow, 6am, don't be late. You did good, kid. Not too tired? - I'm fine. - Why is everything closed? - It's Sabbath. - What? - Sabbath. We never work on Sabbath. - Does it last long? - You're not from here. - No. That's great... That's really great! - Thanks, Eddie. Isn't this beautiful? - It is... I'll take 10. - Take 30! - What if it bombs? - You're not giving a chance to the product. 40 and we're done. - Give me 30 - I take my responsibilities. - Where are you going? - Looking for someone. - What are you doing here? - You're doing the shop opening tomorrow. - Shit! - What is she asking? - She's asking who I am. - You speak English?! - A little. - Sit down - What's your name again? - Edouard. - Liberty... Yvan. - Good evening. - Have you eaten? - I was about to. - Vegetables. She is sweet. - Tell her that her eyes smell of sex. I cannot translate this! - Make it nicer, she'll be happy. - What? - She says the same about you. - Sorry, coming through... Sorry. How are you? How are you? - You're an asshole, I'm the one who got to her first. - Come on, let's go. - Sorry sir, it's a private function. - We are together. - It's ok, he's with us. - Lots of women tonight! - I leave the girl with you. Come on, take her. - Gotcha. - Come on, let me introduce you. How are you? - How are you, Rafi? Rafi... - Eddie. - Rafi Stylmod. - Because of the shop. Sit down. - Drop by the shop... Truth be told,.. you inspire pity Your friend, he inspires pity. - Your girlfriend not joining us? - Who? No, she's Yvan's friend. Swedish horses, not my cup of tea... - I must go now. - Next to Maurice is Benamou. Always says: "Sit-down, want to make money?" - Thanks, you're the best, you're saving me... - Get me a drink. - Have a look at these two. Attia and Benchemoul. The shop's biggest clients. If Benchemoul buys a Mercedes for his wife,.. ..Attia buys his daughter a Rolls. - I'm a classical man, I own a Mercedes. - Sorry - You're gonna save my life. How do you say: "It's over between my girlfriend and I?" - You're a champion! - Here's the champagne! - Monsieur Eddie! I am Serge Benamou. - Pleasure. - Come on, sit down... Move over. I'll introduce you later, first we talk shop for a while. You from Perpignan? Would you like to make money? Do you know Patrick Bruel? Great friend of mine, isn't he, Dov? We're creating a perfume, named "Patrick Bruel". Getting into the business only costs you a quarter mil. Dov told me you want to invest! - No. - No... What's wrong with you? Fuck, I thought we re doing bizness! - Hey, you! Where's Maurice - I don't know, sir. - Be kind, I'm in a hurry.. ..Show me the new stuff. Quick! - This is top of the line. Guaranteed top seller. Wrinkle free. 60 degrees wash, colour invincible. - No, I'm not convinced. What's that one? - That one? Not for sale. - Show me. - Impossible,it's already sold. Not the plastic wrap, M. Benchemoul! Doesn't look that great. - Order is ready, it's going to Germany. - Ah? Who bought it? - Don't know if you know him, a Monsieur Attia. - What, you sold stuff to my brother-in-law without telling me?! Where's Maurice, hiding? - Listen, we have a lovely flanel, I cannot... - I want this cloth and nothing else. No reason for my brother-in-law to be served before me. - M. Benchemoul, Listen... - Mr Benchemoul my ass, I won't leave without it. - Thank you. - See you soon! - Even 1 franc per meter, I don't take it. - On my mother's life, we can make a killing. - A Killing with Partouche?! He owes me 120,000. - Stop it, this is serious business. - I set him up. The bastard went bankrupt on me! - What did you do? Went to see his brother. - Do you know how much he charges for a sandwich-merguez? Guess. - 12 francs? - 18 francs! Stale bread and a sausage. Cost... 40 cents? 17,60 F profit per sandwich, not declared to the IRS! - Finish your story. - And the size of the sandwich! 2 mouths full, you bite your fingers. Ok... So I go see him... Richet Street! Who do I stumble upon? Robert, with a smile a mile wide... "Serge! How are you? So happy to see you!" "What brings you?" "A tornado, you fucker! How you gonna pay me back? This Tunisian bastard tells me... " Listen Serge, you are my friend..." He goes... "I owe you 120,000 francs." "One fries, one sausage, one coke, 30 francs..." "Come have lunch here for ten years, coffee's on me!" - He's fair! - I'm not gonna eat 120,000 worth of sausage! - Calm down... - Tell me, Maurice got a brand new car and you're still driving your old BMW! - The bastard bought the Z 3OO. - He can buy a Concorde for all I care. - Ho! - Who is it? - Your boss's daughter.. Sandra Benzakem. - What a waste... - What a parasite! He does not deserve her! - She is pretty but too fat. - Are you nuts! - You cannot park with this! - Idiot! - You know that Bench?moul is Maurice's client... You stole his client... - But he insisted... - Let me speak! So, you steal his client... when he was at the coffee shop... And you're giving discounts away on my cloth? - But I thought... - The knock-off shops were giving you 6,500? What do I read, here? 175,000? - 175,900... I gave him a special price. - 175,900, a special price! - Maurice works the same way. - I cannot keep you in the warehouse. - I am sorry. - However,.. ..You are hired as a salesman. - Good, You learn fast. - No hard feelings? - No hard feelings. - Be careful, he's a tough one. Let's go visit Rafi. - Why? - You have to look like a salesman! - What? - There... Try this on, you'll see... - Oh no, I cannot wear this. - It goes together! I made the same one for Patrick Bruel. - Very very nice... - That's way to many checkers. - It's the trend this year! That's the way it is... - Ok, but it's too small. - True, he's better built than Bruel. - I don't mind dark blue. - Karine, go fetch me a size 54. In dark blue ... at the back. - Wait, I ll go with you. - Everything ok? - Perfect. - Strange... - No, not here. Stop it... - What's your name again? - Eddie Vuibert. - Vuibert... Is that sefarad? - No. - Askhenazy, then. - Neither. - What? You're not Jewish? - Ah yes, sorry... Indeed, I am Jewish. - Askhenazy, then. - Correct, I didn't understand just now. - Vuibert, Weber, same. It's like Bensard. - Yes, same. - Bensard, the ophtalmologist, you know? - No. - He took a pathos name. - Pathos? - Catholic... a good French name. In reality, his name is Bensaid. Karine! what's the hang up? - What are you doing tonight? - Going out with Rafi. - So you are an Askhenazy... Very few left here, the Sefarads have taken over. - Sorry... There you go. - Another checkered tie... You don't have any polka dots or... Are there any pathos in the Sentier? - Are you kidding! The poor guys would not last 2 months. There's an Armenian, but we take him for a Jew. - Is that so? - Yes, it's not written on his face. - Obviously... Where are we going? - My mother's place. You're not gonna spend Sabbath alone? - Sabbath? No, oh, no... - You are at home here ok? - Listen, fantastic wine! Really, very good... - Your place is really nice. Super... - It smells real good! - Don't talk until we have eaten the breat. - Ah, I under... - What's your name? - Eddie Vuibert. - Is that Jewish? - Vuibert, Weber, same. It's Like Bensaid, it's askhenazy. You know Bensaid, the dentist? You don't know him? Actually, his real name is Bensard. - What Bensaid? - So, Vuibert is a Jewish name? - If he says so. - His father may not be Jewish. Is your father Jewish? - My father is dead. Shame on you. Poor boy Same for Lili et Dov they lost their father. You should have invited your mother. - She died too. They are both dead. - Simon, stop making bread balls, it's a sin. - Mum! Stop serving me food constantly. - You see how he talks to me? He's so lucky to still have a mother! You'd like to be an orphan like your friend? - We are very strict here. On Sabbath, we do not drive, we don't turn on the TV... We deal with spiritual things. - Yes, of course... Listen, I am sorry, but... There's a misunderstanding... I am not... - You're not a practicing Jew. We could tell. - That's ok. - Leave him alone! It's always the same circus with our guests. You know this story? It's about a woman... - Simon! Stop it! It's a sin. On the beach... - I dread his jokes. - She yells "Help! My lawyer son is drowning!" - He's funny! - Lili! Your son.. ..he turned on the TV! - Simon! What are you doing? - What are we gonna do? - We'll leave it on til tomorrow. - What? It's not forbidden. It's already on. - Introduce me. - Come with me How are you? Hey, Sandra, how are you? This is Eddie, he works at the shop. - Hello. - Ah, my father only talks about you. I must be going. It was a pleasure to meet you. - Me too. - If you see Maurice, can you tell him I took a cab. - No problem. - Thanks. - It's a golden opportunity! You put your name on the belt... - I need the keys to your car, quick! - I'm the only one who can drive it! - You are saving my life! - Be extra careful, she's fragile. - I bring her back straight away. - Get in through the passenger door! And fill up the gas tank a bit! - May I give you a lift? It's on my way. - You know where I stay? - No. - I did not tell him for the brakes... - Are you gonna buy me a drink? - Err... yeah, here, take mine. then you can read my thoughts. - I'm not gonna take a full glass. - Fine, here's an empty one. - Shit! - You often steal cars? - I don't understand... - How about this one? - Ah yes, maybe... I must go through your door, the other side is stuck. I am sorry. - Good bye... thanks anyway. - Hurry up, we're leaving. - Where to? - See you in a while. - Do you like Muriel? - Is she the brunette? - Karine and myself, we're running off. As for Rafi, she sleeps at Muriel's. - What? - I'm coming. - What the fuck are they doing? - I don't know. - Always the same thing. I'm fed up! - My brother, I need a favour. - What? - The keys to Patrick's villa... - No, no, no... Last time, you made a huge mess! - God's truth, we won't touch a thing! - If he hears about it, he'll kill me! - You do not want to help a friend? Truth be told, I'm disappointed. - Fuck it! There you go! - Thanks, I love you. - Eh, wait! - What? - Who is it, Lili Dayan? - Can you keep a secret? - Karine. - Karine Benchetrit?! Asshole!

His dig, classy, rite? - Beautiful, beautiful... I thought he was bankrupt? - No, he fucked the banks. He's got enough doe to retire. Hey, girls, how's it going? - Are you coming in? - Why not. - Come on, get in. - Get in, Eddie! Wake up! - What time is it? - 6 o'clock. Hurry up, we wait for you in the car. - Oh, Fuck... Why don't you settle down with her? - You're kidding rite. Marriage is not my thing. - What does she think of it? - No misunderstanding. She's fine with it. On one hand, the shop, the money on the other, she's having good fun... - Sandra... - You don't have a chance in hell. She's nuts over Maurice. Don't sulk. Are you forgetting who you are? - What do you mean? - You're a fucking salesman! - Here, my friend, this is for you. I made a killing with your stretch cloth. - Like I always say... Give the product a chance. - Ok. Listen... If one day... You want to work with me, you give me a call... - God willing. - Are we gonna be playing cards or what? - Coming, Victor, coming... Come here, my son... - So nice to give us a lift, Elie. - Eddie, madam... May I ask where you are going? - To Miami, my sister lives there, with her husband. So, I hear you are serious and hard-working? - I don't know, ask your husband... - You have a girlfriend? - Mum... - What? He's really cute. - Forgive my mother, she's very nosy. - She thinks I'm coming on to you. Elie, Do whatever you want... ... but do not bring back a non Jewish girl. - Of course, madam. - Drop me off here. - What about Miami? - I am not leaving, I have important classes to attend. - Hi, how are you... - Long time no see. - Dov, I need to talk to you. Come! - See you later! - We can make a killing - all we need is balls. - We are not making enough money already? - No. - You really want to have responsibilities? Come on, have a good time! - It's now or never! If not us, someone else will do it. - Good for them! - You want to be salesman for life? We must climb higher! - I think I know where you want to climb. If it's for Sandra, drop it. - Nothing to do with her. - You're a nutcase. - Dov, listen... Come along with me. - Oh, look... - Whati? - Isn't that Maurice's car? - Yes... - Come, let's have a laugh. - We're here, we're here. - Do you always park that badly? - Sorry sir, we're leaving. - We didn't intend to stay - only dogs in the disco. - I don't give a fuck! We've been waiting for one hour! - Calm down. - You must calm down. - It's ok, we're leaving. - Oh! Do you hear? - Ah... - I love that song, fantastic! - They're having me on... - Back in 2 minutes. - I can't believe it! Assholes, bastards! I'll change your car into a sawing machine! Give me the baseball bat! - Georges... - The bat! - No, I don't live far... - Pretty happening tonight? - Yeah Hey, there's a guy been looking at your car funny... - I'll be back. - Hurry up, he looks weird. - Thanks guys. - Fuck! Motherfucker! - Oh, Eddie... - Hello. - Come on in. I am glad to see you. Sorry about the other day. My mother called from Miami, she adores you. - Tell me Eddie... You came for me or my daughter? - I'll leave you to it. - Sit down.. Isn't she beautiful? And such spirit! Like her mother. You see, in life, what's important is not business or money. It's family. - I came for a business proposal. - Go ahead, don't be afraid. - I've been thinking about it for a while... I find it quite a waste to keep working the way we do. As you always say, fashion does not last 2 years like it used to. You must adapt fast, faster... Remember leopard prints: by the time it reached us,.. ..fashion had shifted to Scottish prints... We could not sell Leopard prints and we missed out on the Scottish... We cannot keep working like that. We must find a way to shorten the cycle. If we can print at the client request.. ..ourselves,.. ..and deliver in 48 hours, we're ok. It means: no more inventory problems,.. ..no delays, no deliveries... and less financing problems. Under this system, we need.. ..to buy machines. That's the problem - we need to invest. - You are young, you have ideas... That's good. I've been working for 40 years, No bank refuses me a loan. - I know. - You know... - You misunderstood me... - I did not understand! I'm old! I am glad you came! What would I do without you?! - So? - Nothing, I just left. - Are you nuts! Nobody talks to the old man that way. Listen... He has business interests in the entire Sentier. - Hey, Eddie? I heard you resigned? - News travel fast. - Now you'll get all your clients back. - You're right, I should have done the same. If you need anything, I'm there for you. - Thanks... Did you see that? Dov, let's start our own company. - You need money for that. You cannot just suddenly start a company. Benzakem got banks behind him. - Don't talk to me about Benzakem. He does not understand business anymore. You will not last one season. - You think I will abandon? Never. If we start together, How much can you put in? - No, do not count on me. I promised my mother to buy her an apartment on the Riviera. - I'm already onto a big hit, cash will be coming in. I must just prime the pump, and the banks will follow after that. - Seriously, I cannot risk that. - I will not go beyond 200,000... If my father knows, he'll kill me! - ok, ok, fine! - There's a big problem... The client will know where the stuff is coming from. Partouche has debts everywhere! - Who is talking Sentier? - Guido Battisti! The Italian?! He's Victor's client! - I do not work for Victor anymore. He's with us. 30,000 pieces in one week. - What? What? Even the turks don't work so fast! Can't you just stop for 2 seconds when I'm talking to you? - This way... - Let's leave, these guys are weird. - Come in, come in. - What we need,.. ..is 30,000 pieces like this one. 30,000 pieces in 3 days. The same, identical. - They don't speak French, let's go. - They invented the abacus, they know how to count. 3 days? - I deliver the cloth today ok? And you can start straight away ok? - OK, thanks. Thanks! - Stop it, I don't have time. - Why?! Rafi only closes up at 8 pm. Kiss me. You turn me on! - I'm not in the mood... - What's wrong, today? - I'm gonna leave Rafi. - Why? You're mad. - I'm pregant, Dov Pregnant? - Pregnant! - You're not pregnant. What is this bullshit? What? You think it's mine? - I'm sure. You remember, when my diaphragm... - I don't give a shit about your... You should have said so, I would have been more careful! - It happens! You think I did it on purpose? - You cannot do this to me, Karine, you cannot... I warned you before... Come here. - Don't touch me, you make me puke. - What do you mean? Come here. Fuck, what a bitch... - I have an appointment with Ren?-blue-eyes. I come recommended by Maurice Aflalo... I have a big order which will be paid cash. I will pay you back in one week. Guaranties? - You're a friend of Maurice? That's enough for me. Marco, serve my friend some tea... - No, it's ok, thank you... Please count it... One week. We're going to make a killing! It's not the end of the world. - A baby, that's a decision, shit! Why is she doing this to me? I've always been good to her. - But she's not going to keep it. - She's mad. Whichever way, my life becomes hell. She even wants to meet my mother... - Stop panicking, she's playing her cards, that's normal. - What are you planning for tonight? - The girl with the big breasts. - Are you nuts? She's a she-male. Yes, he's got an Adam's apple! - Stop bullshitting, there he is! There he is! Patriiick! - Look how handsome he looks, he has not changed a bit! - Am I dreaming or you finally have some facial hair! God's truth, it's good to see you! Let me introduce you. Effi, my fianc?e... - Hello! - Rafi... - Where did you find her? - lsra?l, of course! Love at first sight, right, darling? - Your luggage... - She does not speak French. We're gonna get married... Show them the ring, darling. - Why do you speak Hebrew? She's Norwegian! - She's not Jewish? - Soon, God willing. Isn't it, Darling? - Poor girl, she's really in love... - Bloody heavy. Is he carrying the wailing wall? - These guys do beautifully. - Hurry-up and pay them, I even prefer the Turks. Wait, no zipper? Shit, they forgot the zippers... Zippers? - You never ask for zipper! - What is he saying? - The zipper! - Give money! - I need zippers, got it? - You never say zipper! - No need to say zipper! There's always a zipper on a jacket! - You never say zipper! - I need zippers by tonight! - Give him what he wat. Give him what he wants and let's beat it. - I'm not gonna let them fuck me rite? - Fuck it Eddie, let's leave! Money! - Move it, we're late. Be careful on the road, my life's in here... - I call you from Turin. - Well done - I never thought that they would add the fucking zippers! I'm sure this driver is the best. - What are you doing on your own! Come. Come with me... You know Effi? - No. - Pleasure. - Something I don't understand, Patrick... How can you do business when you speak such poor English? - I speak English when I want to buy, not for selling. Everybody understands me. - What's the matter? - Nothing. - Let's go get a drink... - You know I'm starting my own company? - Yeah, my father is apoplectic... I wish you luck. - Thank you. Won't be easy but I think it's worth it. Finally you won't be the boss's daughter. - What does that change? - Everything. - Did you tell Rafi? - I'm old enough to know what to do. Isn't that what you told me the other day? - I wanted to let you know that... If there's any expenses... I will pay for them. - It's re-imbursed by Social Security... I am surprised someone like yourself does not know that! - Karine, stop it... It's as tough for me as it is for you. - Let go of me. - Answer me then. What do you intend to do? - I won't bother you. You can go and sleep in peace, at your mother's! - You seem to be having fun... - Leave me alone! - What? - You know what I m talking about. - Is it because I talk to Lili? We've known each other for 15 years. - She asked you for a ride? She loves to get fucked in a car! - Come on, she's religious. - Oh yeah, is that a guarantee? Do what you want I don't care! - Wait! Here you are giving everyone a show and you're giving me lessons?! - Leave me alone! - Are you kidding? I don't have that kind of money! - Listen, it's real serious! 30,000 or they throw me out! It's not for me, It's for my parents! They are counting on me! - I can't, Serge. I just renovated the restaurant. Ask Patrick, he's your cousin... So why are you bothering me, Serge?! You want? Help yourself... Can you imagine? I had to go to lsra?l to bring back a non-Jew! She will convert - Right, darling? - Speak slowly... - I already got in touch with a rabbi. But it takes years. Do I get married now or wait for her to convert? - Why, is it important? I don't know, but... If you love her the way she is, why change her? - You are right. I found her in the Promised land, right? Is that not a sign? - I don't know... Yes, maybe... - 30,000, It's nothing for him. peas in his couscous! - Don't talk money first. Flatter him... - You are right, a subtle approach... Patrick! World Champion! - Give him confidence, you'll get all you want. On the other hand,.. ...if you put him in a bad mood, all is lost. - It's now or never! - no, no, no! I cannot dance! - On my aunt's life, this is some dancing. - Aunt's... life? - Come on! - Move! - May I have a glass, please. - Patrick! Best Party! I hear that in the US, you're the king! - Who told you that? - Everybody. You are an inspiration for us all! - Too kind. - Patrick, I need to ask you something... - Me too. I need advice, from a friend. I'm 35, I've had business success... Women-wise, no-one could have fucked more than me... - You fucked the most beautiful ones! - But I've had enough. Since I met Effi, I think differently. - Ah, Effi, she's got grace. - Am I right to marry her? - You're having me on, right?! - Why? - You're not gonna marry a non-Jew! - You see, Serge... You disappoint me. A lot. - So? - It didn't work. He's upset with me. - Ask him again next week. - It will be too late! - Don't panic... - You? What's the matter? - We're fucked. - What? Our cargo got stolen on the highway. - The driver? - He was eating, he saw nothing. - Did he lodge a police report? - Fortunately not. - What?! - It's all sweatshops! Legally, our stuff does not exist! Up the ass! - Who did it? - Could be anyone. Someone Partouche fucked, the Chinese, the Gypsies, the Italians! Let it be... - You forgot someone. - Who let you in? - Who stole my cargo? - Who are you to step in here and ask questions? - I want my stuff! - You're stealing all my clients. - I did not steal anything. That's business. - Business?! You could have become someone if you'd stayed with me. Instead of which you'll be leaving with one hand covering the front, one the back Stark naked The little jerks who want to go too fast... they always fall down Deville, Courchevel, your watch... All this is bullshit - This is not the last you'll hear of me. - Good... - I got nothing to lose. - Queen of diamond... 600, 800... - You're in luck, Eddie, You get an extra 24 hours. - There you go! - I cannot give more, sorry. - Even 50,000, I cannot. Plus the cops are onto me. - Why? - Misuse of funds. For the cabrio I bought for Karine. - Fine, I get it. What happened to you? - Your dad did not tell you? - No. - He gave me one season to fail. Seems that was even too long. - My father always held you in high esteem. - See, it has really helped Maurice. Maybe one day he'll manage the shop. And your father will let him marry you. - You're too fucking dumb. - You never give people like me a real chance. - You think it's been easy for us? When my father came to France, He could not read or write. He too wanted to take on the world... Nobody helped him. Did anybody help me? All I wanted was to belong to this world. Just so that you would look at me. That's all. Do you understand that? - Shit, stop it! - What are you doing here? - You're insane! - I've been looking all over for you! - I know. - Fuck, fuck... - You hurt me, you nearly killed me. Your place looks rather 'Zen'. - I sold all my furniture. - The bastards got you real good. - I'm in deep shit. I have a huge debt due by tonight. - Ok, I have good news and bad news. Good news first. For the money, you have been given more time.. ..6 months to a year. - Really? - Yup. That's the bad news... You now owe me the 300 big ones. - You paid for me? - Yes. - Fuck... You're going straight to heaven, you know. - I know. - I'll sign an IOU. - Why not go to an attorney since you're at it? - How about your mother's apartment? - Even if I bought it, she'd never go there. She won't leave Paris until I'm married. - Can I ask you a last favour? - Go ahead. - Can I meet Patrick Abitbol? - Don't get too optimistic... He likes you but you won't get any special treatment. - I don't have a choice. - We will know soon. If he lights up a cigar, he's biting, otherwise... - Bastard! Bastard... It's shorter huh... How many machines to start? - Many... to be believable. - This screen is the most complex in the whole worls! Stereo sound, laser, Dolby, the works. And those fuckers did not even tune the channels! - Shall we talk another day? - Stay put, let me think. - I'm going to the sauna. - Ok darling. She was just on the cover of "Vital". That's a problem. If the rabbi sees the magasine, it harms her application... It's soft, she wears a g-string. But still. It does not look too religious... So we can make money. I already have money. I have 5 full time guys managing my money. One per continent. Why should I break my back and go to work? - I offer you better than money. Will you tell your kids you live from your income, in Panama? My idea is a killer... The whole industry will come to us. That means the whole world. I offer you to be the king of the world. You're not gonna spend the rest of your life watching video clips... Wearing a bib... - I want 80%, I'm taking all the risks - Out of the question. It's my idea, I've already bought all the patents. 50/50 or nothing. - Plus Benzakem's skin. - Victor is your problem, not mine. - So? - I must think about it. - Stylists downstairs, next to reception. Here, accounting and HR. The best would have been a transformable structure. - Transformable? - That's why I preferred Aubervilliers. It will be soon too small here. - It's perfect. - Not bad. - Top class, very beautiful. I love it. - We're gonna have a tough time. - Bitches are waiting for us outside. - This is the machine room, it will be fully automatic. The control room over there. - How does it work? - Like the drums that print newspapers. - It goes all the way up to here. The guide drops it onto the trolley. and it gets sold in the Far East. - Patrick, can I have a word? Sorry, family matters. - What are you bothering me for... - Sorry to barge in. The asshole who was supposed to give me the samples... ..he wants a kickback: 3,000 bucks. I am sorry. - I understand. - Otherwise I get fucked. - And me, I don't get fucked? - You'll get the samples tomorrow. - Delivery tomorrow morning. Ciao! - Eddie, You got a minute? I'm onto something you will like... Look who's here. - Who is it? - Vanier, Benzakem's banker. He would sell his mother to have us for a client. We'll put Benzakem on his knees. - We know you work with some of our competitors. - You are thinking of M. Benzakem? - For instance. Lovely business, isn't it? - Yes... however, it's not what it used to be. Your business has been hurting him. Right now, without our support... - This is exactly what.. ..a business like ours expects from a bank like yours... Fidelity.. ..through the good but also the bad times. - But certainly... - No problem for us to do business with each other. As long as you support Mr Benzakem... ..You will have our trust.. Not a word to Mr Benzakem. - But of course. - I guess you can see my secretary on your way out. - Good bye. - See you soon! We had Benzakem where we wanted him. You don't want revenge anymore? - I have not forgotten. - Sit down. - How are you? - Move your fat ass. - It's true you've put on some weight... - What's the matter? What's the matter? Look at him, he looks strange. - We were just waiting for you, that's all. - Did you know that Sandra was no more with Maurice? - It's not funny. - He tells everybody he fucked her, but actually she left him. - You don't say hello anymore? - Hello, Eddie! - Hello, Sandra. - What's wrong with him? - He looks real embarassed! - Wait for me a second, I think I know... I am happy to see you. You look better. - Thanks... you too. Well... You are beautiful. - I wanted to thank you. For my father. - What are you talking about? - It was very gracious of you. - I don't understand. - My father doesn't know, Yvan told me. - I thought we were supposed to keep quiet about the deal with the banker? - I did not say anything, I swear! - You're a traitor but I love you. - Are you insane... - Shut up, fat ass! - Yvan's specialty! - Thank you, it was perfect. - You don't want to go for a drink? - I had a fantastic evening. But I think it's better that way. - Could I please have... a gin-fizz. - Oh, Dov! Do you know.. .. about Karine and I getting married? - You kept it? - Of course we did - Are you nuts?! Dov, are you out of your mind? - Are you ok? - I'm fine. It's nothing. Drink something... One double baccardi please. - Where are we going? - H?tel Royal, Deauville. Give me your hand. - Bye bye! - Look! - I got sand in my shoes. - Wait. Is that you, darling? - You're not asleep? Sit down. - I know what you're going to say. - Coffee? - Yes, please. Don't look at me this way, I'm not a kid anymore. - I thought you were no more together. - I was not with Maurice. - Good, Good! Then, it was... - Dad, I am tired. I am going to bed. - Stay for a while. Looks like you're avoiding me. - You always exaggerate, it's in your nature. - If it was not Maurice, who then? I'm asking you a question. I like to know what you're doing, what's become of you. - Where are you going? - The boss. - No appointment? - No. Where's his office? Lady luck seems to be on your side... - I'm not complaining. - Enjoy while it lasts. - Mr Benzakem... - Let me speak. My daughter,.. ..she's not a toy - I'm not playing. - That's what I wanted to hear. If you want to work with Maurice... He doesn't work for me anymore. - Is that so... - He wanted to launch his own line.. ..in Spain. I really don't like that design, actually. - If the operation is a success, my father will see again. I cannot let this opportunity slip away. I must find the 10, 000 F, the bastard doctor wants a kick-back. Who can you trust these days? - I don't know...where is Effi? - I'm talking about my mother. - You're boring me. Go look for Effi. Patrick is looking all over for you. Come back to our table. - You're also looking for me... - What's the matter with you? Are you mad! - You are scared! - I am not scared. - Eddie, I didn't recognize you. You look different. - Come with me to the toilet... Something is wrong with Eddie. - What's the problem? - Maurice. He stole the jackets. What jackets? - I'll explain later. - Like I always said, always give the product a chance. That's why I left Benzakem. His business is dead. Beware of him, he's an asshole. - You got something on your face. - Eddie, who are you beating up? Maurice! - Stop it! You'll kill him! - There, I always pay my debts. - Wake up. Wake up. - What's the matter? - We mustn't stay here. - Help him. - What's this mess all about? - nothing, nothing, here's for you... - Can I ask you a question? - Go ahead. - Are you really a Jew? Answer me. - Of course I'm Jewish. Even if I was not Jewish, it would make no difference to Sandra - If you were not Jewish,... ..You would not stand a chance in front of the Rabbi. - Shit, you guys took forever! - You ok? - You? - What's wrong with you? - I hate this music. - What's wrong? - He's in love with Effi! - Poor girl, she had a rough night in the toilet, right Serge? - Is she really gonna convert? - By the way, Nicole, your ex, she converted for nothing? - For nothing? Of course not! Nicole was nothing, I was 25! Effi is different, solid. - Really solid, right, Serge? - What's all these "right, Serge"? - I don't know... Shut up! No fighting! - What a pain in the ass! - Stop it! - Are you hiding something from me? Yvan, what's the matter? Are you saying Serge fucked Effi? Right, Serge? Did you fuck her? - I swear I did not. Yvan, tell him! - I asked you the question. - I did not do anything. I did not do anything! - I was just kidding. Just having you on! Can you imagine Effi, with your kind of face? Ugly as you are! - Fuck, get out! - Stop it, you're really a pain! - Tell her. - Leave me alone. - It's really important - She'll know sooner or later. - A wedding is not a complicated affair! - It's a Jewish wedding you idiot! - Sandra Rachel Tsiporah Benzakem... Daughter of Victor Haim Moshe Benzakem... It is with great happiness that I prepare your wedding. I have such esteem for your father,.. ..so generous with our community. Did you bring your birth certificates? - Yes. Did my father tell you about Edouard? - Mmh. ok... You? - Sorry.. I forgot. I'll bring it next time, promised. - Please remember. - Yes, father. - Do you have your parents' ketoubbah? - Ketoubbah? - Wedding certificate. - I do not have it. - Your parents' synagog can send it to me. - Listen... I think my parents.. ..did not get married at a synagog. My father was against it... And my mother did not even want me circumcised. But I am circumcised! I can prove it, here, now. - Not necessary... Sorry, but if there is no proof.. ..of your religious ascendency, there will be no ketoubbah. - Never mind, we'll do without. We don't need a ketoubbah to get married, right? - I hope you're joking? I didn't tell you (I wanted to surprise her)... I can get Jean-Jacques Goldman. to play at the wedding... I know his producer. It will be fantastic! - I'm going home. - Darling, wait! Father! You are spoiling everything! - Would you stop calling me "father"! - Can I see you alone? - What are you doing? - Wait for me outside. I discuss with Mr Rabbi and I'll be with you shortly. - I'm sorry, really sorry. Mister Rabbi... - It's difficult to lead a community... Don't be modest! I've seen the state the seats are in, the leak in the ceiling. - You wanted to talk about personal matters... - Yes, well... I would like some sort of... confirmation of my judaism. - I beg your pardon... - Yes. I am not really sure of my parents' judaism. Not at their level, but maybe one ot two generations before. - You wish to convert? - Why convert? I am a Jew! Ashkenazy, you can ask around! I want to deal with this as quickly as possible. No need to mention it to the in-laws, let this remain between us. On top of the roof repairs,.. ..I would like to thank you for your understanding... - No! - What, Mr. Rabbi! - Scandalous! I have never seen this! Sorry, this wedding is impossible! - Why? - We'll find another one, darling, there are rabbis everywhere. - A such late hour? - Could be your mother. - No, she got the keys. Who is this? - What's happening? - It's all my fault! - I thought you were going to get rid of the baby. I'm going nuts. - Shut up. - You are not well? You want to go to the hospital? - Dov, have you been drinking? Enough! Let go of her! - Stop bothering me! It's my kid. She's bearing my son... And I wanted him to die... - It's a girl. - A little girl? A little girl... Please tell me you forgive me. - Dov, stop it, stop it please. - I love you. I love you! My love... - Impossible! Is this a joke?! - I'm going to get my stuff... - Yes. Wait, wear this. There, we'll come back later for the rest. - You guys are having me on, right? Is this a joke? Darling, say something! - You would have known... - But I love you! - Don't make things tougher, please. - We loved him like a son, this is how he repays us. Dov should marry your daughter. They've known each other since they were kids. - What are you talking about. Your son is marrying Karine. - At least she's Jewish! - But she's pregnant! - She told him he was the father and she believed him. - You are starting to seriously piss me off. If she wants to marry him, she will marry him. - He is a goy! - It happens. You'd prefer she marry Maurice? Benayoun's son? I took him in, he fucked up my accounting. - At least, he's not religious. - What do I do? I call back the caterer? - No wedding, no caterer. - Rafi? Get up, you moron! - I want to die. - Did you see this? He had to dive under MY car! Doing this, to ME! - Shut up! Speaking that way is a sin! Are you nuts or what? - Let me die, Patrick. - Come on, get in! Get in! Come on. - Run me over, Patrick. - If one cannot trust his own friends... - You are a friend. Get in! Everything is fine. - I want to die! - A massage will relax us. - Oh yes! - Shit, look who's here... - Don't be an idiot. - I must talk to you. - Leave her alone, you've done enough! Come, my dear. - Let it be, she doesn't know what she's missing. Thanks, Georges. - Follow my example. Am I calculative with men? They come, they go, I don't care. - Everything will be fine, Ediie look at Charlie Ohayoun, he's not Jewish... - Who? - Charlie Tex-Gros. - Rachel's husband, the big breasts... - Wait... Since when is Ohayoun not a Jew? - His mother is a goy. - Did you hear that, Eddie? - I swear it on my life! And he still goes skiing in Courchevel... - No need to be Jewish for that. - Charlie is not even circumcised. - Who told you? - Myl?ne. - Charlie fucked Myl?ne? - She even fucked with Yvan. - You're the pretty boy, but I get laid. - Myl?ne the sex bomb! - She's a hot thing. - Hotter than Lili Dayan? - No - Lili, her pussy's like a lighter. - She eats only Kosher... But she does the dirtiest things! - I'm ashamed of you guys... Eddie must be happy to be goy. Aren't you, Eddie? - Eddie, what's wrong? - What's the matter? - Can't you see he's in pain? - He started it, talking about Charlie! - You don't know how to shut up. - No towel for you. - Stop it! - Butt naked! - I'm gonna make you eat it! - Sir, where are you going? It's forbidden! - One last word. - I don't want to see you anymore. - I wanted to thank you - It would have been a huge error to marry you. - Gentlemen, please! Forbidden! Gentlemen! - The cops are here... - Listen to me! - You're letting people work you up just because I'm not Jewish? - Why did you lie to me? - If you had known, would you have agreed to marry me? You would not even have looked at me. - It's not true. - Yes it is. If you had loved me the way I love you, nothing could have been stronger. - Can't you see she's about to give birth! - Shit, my daughter! - She's giving birth... - Let Uncle Serge hold you my darling, come... How will she manage with such a father... Take her, she's starting to cry. - Dov is taking good care of us. I have no regret. - Such a shame to see them like this! - Dov has never been that happy. - My son? I mean Eddie... - Why doesn't he go after her,.. ... this idiot? - What are you doing?! Simon, my god! What are you doing? - Never mind, he's having fun. - Give me back my daughter. - wait, wait... - Give her back. - wait... - Isn't she lovely? - No touching this one ok? - Why do you tell me that? - I'm kidding. - Sorry I'm late. Where's the treasure? - Come here... Why me? I've done it last time. - Because I like you. - Ivan, you're getting bullied! - Don't listen to him. I bought size 1 year, this way you got time. - Hmm... thanks. - May I take her for a while? - Err, ok... - Be careful... Thank you. Amazing how she looks like you? Spitting image. Isn't she? You remember what you told me in theTurkish baths? That if I love you like you love me, nothing is stronger? Remember? Well, nothing is stronger for me. - Mazel tov, my brother! - I knew it! - I told you! - You took your own sweet time!
