ON THE EDGE No smoking in my car! - I'm not in your car. I shouldn't have given you the case. You fucked it up. Are you taking me off the case? - Fix your own fuck-ups. But if it's not sorted in a week, I'll put another team on it. It can't go on like this. I'll offer you a transfer to Lige, which you will kindly accept. - Yeah, right. Francois, that'll do for today. You can go home. Good evening. Lead Inspector, Virginie Rivage. Who was driving? You didn't have to stay, you know. How is he? Sadly, he died in surgery. You should get home, it's late. Yes, I'll take you home. Thank you. Would you like to see a doctor? A guy who commits suicide like that doesn't pick the driver. He chooses a train on impulse. Really, you mustn't take it personally. It's happened to me three times in fifteen years. Each time, it turned my stomach, and messed with my head. Don't hesitate, call me any time. Whatever you need, OK? Thanks. Follow me, no messing around. Let go! Let go! Let go! Stop! What's this? Drop it! Give me a moment, please. Just a moment. Hello. - Hello. We'd like to talk to you. Coffee? Mind if I take a look around? Go ahead. Why didn't you tell me that was your son on the tracks? There'll be an autopsy. Your son had a gunshot wound. Who shot him? We think he was involved in a robbery. - What robbery? The investigation is ongoing, I can't talk about it. When did you last see him? Two years ago. It's been two years. Did you fall out? No, I don't think so. You weren't close to your son? I let him live his life as he chose. Two years is a long time. - Yes, perhaps. What happened between you two? - I don't know what to say, miss. I'm sorry. Do you live alone? Yes, unfortunately. Where is your son's mother? - In Spain. She died. Six years ago. Your son's body is at the funeral home. I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you. Mr. Castaneda? Your son was wearing this the day he died. Please remain available for questioning. Hello, I'm the neighbor from upstairs. The Spanish guy? - Yes. Sorry to bother you, but I dropped some clothing on your balcony. I'll get it for you. - No, no... It's a pair of underpants. I admit it's not very clean. It's probably better that I get it myself. Why are you talking about a Muslim ceremony? The document was filled in by the police. It states "Muslim rite." That can't be right. My son will be cremated with no religious ceremony. As you wish. I can give you a slot at the end of next week or tomorrow morning. Yes. Tomorrow. Sandra, it's Mathieu. Yes. Do you have a slot tomorrow? Before midday? No, it won't last long. I'll call you later with the details. OK? Bye. There are various options... - Can I see my son? That's not possible today. Perhaps tomorrow you can spend time with him, before the ceremony... but you cannot actually see him. Your son was autopsied by court order. We received the body already prepared and sealed, so we sadly cannot show him to the family. If you wish, we can have his initials engraved on the urn. Don't bother. Do you read me? - Articulate and it'll do. He's not getting in. What's he doing? He's just let a metro pass. Magali, has he spotted you? No way. He's never looked around. He doesn't even know I'm here. - I'm sure he knows. If he does, drinks are on you. - Shut up. You can't do surveillance, with your ugly mug. How did you even join the police? You don't like my mug? Let's just say, I wouldn't suck your dick. Don't knock it till you've tried it. - Enough. Is he still on the platform? - Yes. What's he doing? - Nothing. Here we go. He's just got on the metro. The bastard's pulling a fast one on me. The metro's stopped in the tunnel. Police! Open the door! - Go on. Open the door! Please do not attempt to open the doors before the train reaches the station. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your driver, we ask you to be patient... Hello, Mr. Castaneda? My name's Malika. I'm your son Hugo's girlfriend. Please... give them back all the money that Hugo kept. They say they'll kill me if you don't. Please... Let's settle this tonight. Where are you? Where does it hurt? My head. Paracetamol, if you're not allergic to it. I think he came to see you. Is he a friend of yours? - My son. He came in yesterday. You have blood in your eyes. - Yes. It happens when I'm tired. I'll give you some eye drops. - Thank you. Is he feeling better? Mr. Castaneda? As part of our investigation of your son for his involvement in a crime, we will now search your home. After you. What was that trick you pulled? You like to vanish into thin air? Thin air? What's that? Disappearing when you know you're being watched. Being watched? Me? - Yes. I didn't know I was. - Where did you go? Nowhere. For the police, "nowhere" doesn't exist. You're always on the map! Where were you? First I turned left. Then left again. Further on, I went right, then straight on, then, I don't know where, maybe... - You like to walk? I love to walk. It helps clear my mind. I can walk all night. - Let's go then, since it does you good. Your son gave you something. What was it? We're waiting. What did he give you? His hand. He gave me his hand. You didn't follow accident protocol. The driver must stay on board, never go down on the tracks. What was in his hand? A bunch of keys, something like that? What are those keys? We know you didn't go to his place. Did he give you an address? He let five metro trains pass. Your son was in that station for half an hour with a bullet in his lungs. He could barely stand. He was waiting for you. He wanted to talk to his father. We checked, he didn't call you. Hugo had just taken part in a heist. Perhaps he thought his phone was tapped. Hugo knew he would find you at that station. What did he say to you? He told you something about the robbery, right? Your son hung out with them. A brother and sister, Farid and Malika. Did you ever see them with Hugo? No. I don't know them. - Your son converted to Islam. I didn't know. Did he mention religion? Never. - Was he baptized? Everyone's baptized in Spain. It's tradition, not really a choice. It's for the family. He chose Amar as his Muslim name. Amar? In Arabic it means "he who builds" or "the eternal." It means love. In Spanish, it means love. - Not "te quiero"? Both are used. Commissioner. Carry on. Arsen Vannas and Benjamin Kirko, both linked to organized crime. Have you ever seen these men? - No. Why did Hugo hang with guys like this? - You're his father. I should be asking you. We've been on their trail a while. They opened a boxing club. They worked with drop outs. Kids like your son and Farid, Malika's brother. I don't think Vannas and Kirko ever intended to share the loot. This man is a police officer. Ralph Silva. A great policeman. He had infiltrated the boxing club. We haven't heard from him. Why won't you tell me what your son gave you? You're imagining things. - I don't think so. I'm going to be late. My son will be cremated this morning. Is the kid's father all you've got? - He's slim pickings. All I have is his civil status, his address, his metro driving schedule, no charges against him. He's free. - Did you ask Interpol for info? First thing this morning. No news yet. There's something bugging me about this guy. I'll see what I can dig up. The results of the blood samples on the highway overpass. Ralph was definitely hurt. Probably in the belly. There were strong traces of gastric acid. A bullet to the gut is fatal without emergency aid. Virginie. A few days off would give you some perspective. I'm hearing rumors. Are you having an affair with Ralph Silva? What would it change? Everything. My daughter can sleep with whoever she likes. I have nothing to say about that, even though I don't like it. Subordinates sleeping with each other, I will not tolerate! We know where it always ends. It messes up teams and ruins investigations. Have you slept with him? Who's asking? My father or the Commissioner? Your father. Well, go fuck yourself, then. Why did you refuse a Muslim ceremony? What did you do in Spain? - The same thing I do here. A metro driver? - Yes. Can't that jerk see my lights? Want me to drive? Were you sick of the metro in Madrid? Why did you come to Brussels? Don't know. The weather? The football championship? C'mon, Hugo, try harder! Look straight ahead, not back! Straight ahead! Jeez, he's so fat. Pain in the butt. He's a child... It's embarrassing. Shit. After the bend, I'll tow you! Shall I drive you home? Is it mandatory? I'd rather go alone. What're you going to do? Are you going to follow me? Won't you tell me? - Are you interrogating me again? Thank you. That's Ralph. - Yeah. Freeze! Nobody move and everything will be fine. Open the door. Open the goddamn door! C'mon! We had them right there. We never should have let them out. There were 50 people in the car park and as many in the hall. We should have arrested them there. Before they holed up. They were trapped and we wouldn't have lost a friend. Francois, stop busting our balls. Move it! Here, you're going to like this. What's this crap? Interpol won't show us his file. - For real? On your knees! Tea? Coffee? I'd rather smoke, if I may? Inspector Rivage? Judge. - Please enter. What do you want to know? - Everything. Who is this guy? We have an agreement about him with the Spanish legal authorities. OK. And? I have to make do with that? - We all do. Well, I can't. I lost one of my men in that operation. I don't even know if he's still alive. Anything that may help us find them is precious. Castaneda knows something, but he's not talking. Why was he allowed to change his name? Irritating bitch! She wouldn't open the file? - No. The authorities in Madrid are covering him. I need it to think. - It stops me from thinking. What's with the don't-smoke-in-my-car thing? If they let Leo change his name, he must have been involved in a big legal case. In Spain, it's almost only allowed for repentant ETA members. So he's a Basque terrorist? He may have detonated bombs, shot people, killed cops. - I have no idea. Can you spare a smoke? We'll have to go back to the hideout tonight. If it's a PC you're after, there are more inside. Is this a good one? - Depends what you want to do. If you want to hack into the Pentagon, it isn't up to the job. Got anything cheaper? Nice accent. Where are you from? - Spain. Nice. Are you Mexican? - Right. Belgian father and Mexican mother, so I'm Belgicano. I'm Leo. - Carlos, nice to meet you. Carlos, can you help me? How can I connect this to a computer? With this. I'll take this one. Frankly, Leo, I'd advise you to take that one. Why? - The other one is crap. These must be Ralph's things. We opened the next one. It's the kid's. They put paper in the gloves, to absorb the sweat. That will do it. Yeah, you're handsome. Very handsome. Jeez, it's huge! How did you find this? - What is it to you? Wait for me there. Go back. Wait for me over there. Listen when I talk. Wait over there. OK, I'm waiting! Come here. Take this. It's a present. - A necklace? Yeah. It's gonna be fine. I'll be back right after. - I hope so. Hey, man. - Is the car ready? Yes. - OK. What did you imagine? I get a gun too, right? - You don't shoot, you drive. What d'you mean? I need a gun. Stop! - What if it goes sour? If the cops shoot, are you gonna shoot back? Could you shoot a cop? - No... Brussels, chimney, power station What's going on? - The warehouse is empty. My guess is they won't be back. What are you doing here? - Interpol is demanding a report. The judge wants copies of all statements. You're making everyone nervous. Virginie, I'll have to personally take charge of the investigation. Get some rest, we'll talk about this tomorrow. You can't take me off this case. It's a technicality. - No. You can't do this now. I'll put you on another case. I don't want another case, Dad. Enough is enough! You've lost perspective. You're way too emotional. It just won't do. I refuse! You're driving me nuts! You're heading into the wall. You just can't see it! I don't want to lose another man in this case. How can you say that to me? We'll talk about this tomorrow. Go home. Virginie? - Yes, Carl? We have a visitor. Let go of that! Hold still! Hold still! Goddammit, Castaneda, that's enough! Carl for Commissioner. Where are you? Police! Freeze! Turn around, nice and slow. I said, turn around! What are you doing? Stop, Castaneda! What are you doing? Dammit, Castaneda! Get back here! I think I've displaced a vertebra. He must be a black belt, your Spaniard. He cuffed me like he's done it all his life. Do you think he could be... a former cop? If he is, he's way ahead of us. He came here to retrieve weapons. Which means he's on the trail of his son's killers. Right... until I'm back on my feet, the case is yours again. The bullet must have bounced off the frontal curve. How is that possible? According to his surgeons, the bullet caused little damage to the cranial cavity. Apparently, he suffers from chronic violent migraines which cause dizziness and nausea. Can't they remove it? - Apparently not. He was in a coma for four months. They didn't know if he'd make it. It's a miracle he's still alive. What happened to his son all that time? He came to Brussels. He was fostered out. His father joined him when he had recovered. What did the foster family know? - Nothing at all. Some people don't ask questions. Does that even exist? The world's full of people who don't ask questions. Where can I meet this wonderful family? They may have info for me. I doubt it. They're dead. They were already very old back then. An address? I want to get a feel for where Hugo and his father lived. He's switched off his phone, we can't locate him. I have no way of finding him. Help me. Leo Castaneda. Why won't you tell me his real name? Because I don't know it. This thing isn't working. I can't play the videos, nothing. Who are you spying on, your wife? - No, yours. Can you do anything? - It's very simple. We retrieve the memory card, put it on a USB stick and you're good to go. It's easy? At worst, you'll lose a few images if the card is damaged. But it's doable. How much will it cost? Any tits? I don't think so. - I'll do it for 50. I'm in a hurry, when can you do it? For this evening. Look... I'll give you 200. But no questions about the video. Is that clear? The urn is empty. There was a car here. Given the width and wheelbase of the tires, it was a muscle car. I'd bet it was German. This is one sweet Alfa. Can we still see Ralph? - Negative. He's just turned onto the highway. Do we still have the GPS signal? Negative. If we fly lower, can we pick up the GPS frequencies? We can try. We'll do a flyover. Sorry, we've lost the signal. I thought you were closed. - As soon as you leave. Everything OK? Is everything there? The beginning is fine, then it gradually gets worse. It's good equipment. The sort cops have. But you're not a cop, right? Yes, it's police equipment. I told you not to ask questions. When you leave, I'll wipe my surveillance footage. You never came here and you never come back, OK? Thank you, Carlos. What're you doing? - Shut up, you. What're you doing? - I said shut up. Is there a problem? - Shut the fuck up. Bastards! They put a GPS tracker on the banknotes. They knew we were coming. - The cops? Goddammit! It's not a problem, OK? Right, we're gonna change routes. We're not going to the warehouse? - No, we're not! We're going to switch cars. I don't get it. - It's part of the plan. Stop under the bridge. Load the money into the BMW. Go guard the entrance. Move it. Let's take a look. What the fuck's going on? What are they doing? Shit! What the fuck are they doing? Get down! Get down! Farid! - What? I said get down! I told you I needed a gun! Drive! I've been hit. Drive! Mr. Castaneda. - I want to talk to Malika. What's he waiting for? What is that idiot doing? Go check it out. Shitty phone. Forget it. He broke the key in the ignition. And the money? - It's there. But there's no bag. It's just a pile of notes. It's gonna be a pain. Park alongside. What the fuck is he doing? Take him down. Malika! Shit! Come on! You know how to fight, huh? It's in your blood. Not like your son. What're you gonna do? Go on, shoot! Shoot and we both explode. Give me the gun. Give it to me! Go on, put it on the ground. - No. Put down the gun. I've seen your file. The people you infiltrated discovered you were a cop. They killed your wife. And they were going after your son. I'm the one they wanted to eliminate. Me. They found me... lying in a pool of blood. I was dead. So... they let my son go. It's the only time I fired my service gun. She's your daughter, right? Is it that obvious? You have... a very special way of getting her back up. It reminds me of me... with my son. Did you choose your name? No. There was a Castaneda in the French football team. I didn't know that. In the '80s, a great goalie. You like football? I found it on the Internet. Jean Castaneda. Is it for me? - Yes. Thank you. Safe journey. Take care of yourself. Good luck.
