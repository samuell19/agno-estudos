This is the second stockpile discovered since last month's gruesome poisoning death of a mentally handicapped man. The highly toxic rat poison was imported and sold by Chinatown businessman Leonard Fong. Upon news of the death, Fong agreed to destroy his remaining inventory, but claims it was stolen before he could do so. The pesticide continues to be sold illegally throughout Chinatown. Despite this, police refuse to press charges against Mr. Fong, stating that, "A tolerant business community "should not punish newcomers "simply for being unaccustomed to stateside safety regulations."

All of this stemming from an art exhibit displaying a photograph which features the Canadian flag in a piece of fecal matter, floating in a jar of urine. Needless to say, most Canadians find this image appalling and are demanding that the artist face criminal charges. The gallery has since taken down the picture, and many news outlets have refused to broadcast it, but that seems little comfort to these demonstrators. [protestor]; Yeah, you know, we as Canadians pride ourselves on being a tolerant nation and all, but when you desecrate our national symbol like that, that won't be tolerated.

I have here letters from your office trying to purchase property in the warehouse district. So?

If you're breaking and entering, you picked the wrong fuckin' place, pal. you picked the wrong fuckin' place, pal. [roaring] [groaning] My hands are weapons. Just in case. [circular saw whining] Allow me. Such a pretty face. Such a shame to have to destroy it. Stop! What the hell are you? I am the bringer of pain. Release the young adults or die. Let's be reasonable here. Free them or be destroyed in a tornado of rage. Negotiation is my business. I don't negotiate with terrorists. [screams] Hold it. As I was saying, I don't negotiate with terrorists. I annihilate them. Surely, we can come to some sort of agreement. I have no quarrel with you. What did I just say? I just said I don't negotiate with terrorists. Shit. Looks like I win this round of negotiations. Don't negotiate with terrorists. [muffled screams] [yelps] [circular saw whines] [screaming] Vengeance. [gasping] Is someone gonna tell me what the fuck is going on? Amy, I wish I knew where to start. We're on a quest for vengeance. I said that already. Thank you. Thank you. For it was the adventures of Homo Dynamous that made a warrior out of me. Dude, you're weird. Perhaps. But [empty gun clicking] [roaring] What are you doing? You get out of here, okay? I can't go. What? Not now. Not after everything, okay? Travis, we're barely getting out of here alive. Let's go! And what happens tomorrow? He'll just keep coming after us, Amy. We'll move to Omaha. Come on! I'm staying here. Travis, no! Travis, no! Travis, no! [whispering] Okay. So, what's the big plan? I don't know. What? I got caught up in the moment. What the fuck were you thinking? Shh! Shh! Okay, okay, go, go. Okay, okay, go, go. Freeze! You just couldn't keep your mouths shut, could you? Why should we? Here's one reason. Don't worry about her. A bullet will take her pain away soon enough. Shame on you, Mr. Warner. I showed you mercy, and this is how you repay me? You cause all this bloody mayhem over a little comic book? It's funny, I was gonna say the same thing to you. Then let those be your last words. [shot blasts] Time to shut you up for good. [choking and gasping] [screams] Time to shut you up, douche! Time to shut you up, douche! Time to shut you up, douche! [whispering] Hey... Hey. Are you okay? What a dick. You'll live. You'll live. Come on, you little pain in the ass. Hey, let's go. Hey, let's go. Hey, let's go. That's vandalism, you know. Eat a bag of dicks! Oh. That's the spirit. Hey, man. How's it going? Yeah, good. How are you? Oh, good. How's Meat Tornado? Uh, we broke up. Oh. What happened? Shitty management. Okay. It's all good, man. Suzie and I, we started a new band. Ah, cool. What are you guys called? Right on. Hey, let me know if you need cover art, okay? Oh, yeah? Drawing again? Killer, man. Never say die, Wayne. Never say die. Catch ya around. Take care, man. Viva la Frankencunt! [laughing] [laughing] Hey. How's it going? Fine. I could use a hand, though. Did you actually just say that? Should I even ask? That is Art Class 12th Grade. I called it "Triumph of the Wang." It's catchy. Squeeze its right nut. [recording blares] Sieg heil! Oh, that's super helpful, thank you. Yeah, no sweat. Open it. Open it. That's really sweet. Yeah. I'm proud of you. Oh, that's it. I thought this would deserve at least a blowjob. At least. [scoffs] Get lost. What a gyp. Maybe later. If you help me unpack some of this crap. [scoffing] All these rules... Blumpkin, starts Friday. This is KMHW breaking news. A rather stunning proposal is garnering support in New York City, where world leaders are meeting to discuss Tell me that's a joke. a law that is raising eyebrows "Dear Members of the World Community, if you can't take a joke, fuck off." That'll set 'em straight. It's a dirty job, but someone's got to do it. Speaking of dirty jobs... Oh, yeah. [giggling] civil libertarians, on the other hand, called any such restriction appalling and Draconian, but at this meeting, they seemed to be outnumbered. Don't even think about it. As world leaders gathered today in New York City, many pledged support for the Canadian delegate's call for restrictions on freedom of speech. We must stand united as a community and let the art world know that freedom of speech is not freedom to say whatever you want.
