While at war Present... arms! Attention! Today, the 19th of July, 1936, a state of war is declared in salamanca, and with god's help, in all of Spain! Article one! Gatherings of more than three people in public are forbidden! Those who disobey will be immediately dispersed by force! - Article two! - It's about time, soldiers! - Traitors! Sons of bitches! - Long live Spain! - Long live the Republic! - Long live Spain! In the next twelve hours, anyone in possession of short and long firearms and explosive substances must surrender them at the civil guard station nearest to their domicile! - Long live the social revolution! - Long live the Republic! Fascists! After that time, anyone with firearms will be considered a rebel! Article four! It is strictly forbidden to approach electrical energy lines without a legitimate reason! Article five! Casto prieto, you're under arrest. What are you accusing my husband of? Shut up, ma'am! You're kidnapping the mayor of salamanca! Calm down, ma'am. Scoundrels! Scoundrels! Grandpa! Grandpa! My aunts said to tell you. Tell me what? Who wish to support the glorious uprising to save our fatherland, donor contributions will be opened tomorrow. Any effort is little in such decisive moments. We continue with the following announcement... Dad, where are you going? Can't you hear the gunfire? Dad, please. Where is my txapela? My txapela. Here. If you're going out, I'm going with you. No, my girl. You're staying here. Lock the door. Don't open it for anyone. Grandpa! Miguelin, go back inside! Good afternoon. That's him! Did you see him? Who? - Miguel de unamuno. - Yeah, the writer. Good afternoon. - Have you heard? - Yes, yes, get your husband. I'm coming, Don Miguel, I'm coming! Atilano, please, be careful! Of course, we will, enriqueta. Go out today? Today is madness. Then don't come. Come on, atilano, I'm losing my pace. Wait for me! There. And the other one went down over there. I don't see any blood, Salvador. - Atilano, for god's sake. - Don't blaspheme. Five dead. Five! And the other side didn't shoot? Sure, the communists and syndicalists never do anything. Don't start with that, please. They're the ones who burn churches and convents, Salvador, I'm not making this up. How would you know? You're not even catholic. Yes, I'm a protestant, but here, in Spain, people are attacking faith in Christ. Just like in Russia. Am I right, Don Miguel? I'd rather save my tongue for the press. I have an interview in half an hour. Anyway... You're leaving already? Why did you bring us here? For a cup of coffee like every afternoon. And you're not going to say anything? About what? Miguel, they're attacking the Republic. Salvador, my boy, how long have we known each other? Do you really want me to talk to you about the Republic? That's for mine. And a donkey. University of salamanca and that's why I ended up in fuerteventura. In exile. For trying to change things. And when they finally changed, when we finally got rid of the king and the Republic we had so longed for arrived... No order, no peace, no bread, nothing. And that law they passed for autonomy in catalonia, which I myself voted for, but not to break Spain apart... Go ahead. No. No, no! Absolutely not! No, sir! I haven't betrayed the Republic. The Republic betrayed me. And, paradoxically, I still love it. That's why this is necessary. - To restore order. - You can't go in there! Dean, sir! Anyway, I have to hang up now. And write everything correctly, you journalists destroy the Spanish language. I have spoken. Goodbye. They took him away, Don Miguel. No charges, no explanation, only because he's the mayor and a socialist. And how many times did I say something like this could happen? To all of you, didn't I warn you? What we have to do now is cooperate. Cooperate with who? With the uprising? Over my dead body. No, sir. Death... A whole country willing to die for political ideas. Look who's talking! You were never one to keep yours quiet. Look, Ana. There's really nothing I can do in this matter. Well, I can help you with a little money... - Money? - While casto is in prison. You mean if they don't kill him first. You'd feel differently if they took someone from your family. - Ma'am, please! - Then you'd know how it feels! But... how atrocious. That's how Spain works, ramos. Spanish protectorate in Morocco Twenty junkers crossing Gibraltar, day and night. An airlift for your troops. Long live Hitler! It's never been done before. That way we can help our brothers who have risen up to save the Republic from communism. Please relay our enormous gratitude to Berlin. Bring lemonade for the German gentlemen. Yes, general. The fiihrer is concerned about the death of general hansurch... San... Sanjurjo. And he wants you to name a new leader as soon as possible. From now on leadership will be exercised by a military junta in burgos. Decisions will be made by consensus. You cannot win without a leader. The fiihrer might withdraw his support. That look in his eye again, like he doesn't understand. Sometimes I think he's mocking us. We have to keep squeezing these Germans. Like lemons. And what they said about a leader? They could cut us off, general. Paco. You have to step forward now. No. Let's go! Two lines from right to left! "Sole article: The article passed on September 30th of 1934 is hereby revoked. Don Miguel de unamuno is therefore dismissed as lifelong Dean of the university of salamanca and likewise relieved of all other related duties." - Would you put that newspaper away? - Why? - It's from Madrid, you idiot. - And it's signed by Manuel azana. It looks like you're out of a job. - Badly written, like all his writings. - And the drawing? Look, grandpa, it's badly written! Pay him not mind, he's senile they're attacking me. The reds are attacking me. You know why, right? Because of the five thousand pesetas. My girl... I made that donation to soldiers. To fascists, dad. Fascists. And you gave them what you make in six months. Soldiers doing their duty for the Republic. If people in this house ever read my articles... - I read them. - Shut up and eat. When you reach my age, you'll understand. Right, it must be a matter of age then... - Who? - Casto. Our mayor? But he was arrested, Salvador. Arrested. Lying in a ditch, shot in the head. The milkman saw him on his way to valladolid. Why should we believe what a milkman says? Here we go again, atilano. What about the gunfire we heard this morning? People are getting killed here. Poachers. Do you really believe that? All that really matters, gentlemen, is that nobody here has abolished the Republic. I have spoken. Your coffee, your paper figures, all is well. Salvador... - You've really changed, Miguel. - What do you mean? Look, son, I haven't changed. When have I ever stayed quiet about something? Well, lately you've gone mute. Mute and asleep, you don't even skip a siesta. Hey, Salvador, bite your tongue. Hear this. Even asleep I'm more awake than the rest of you. Why don't you flee to the red zone, with Don Manuel azana? And since he fired me, tell him... So that's what's eating you. Gentlemen... tell him... To fire himself, for the good of Spain. - Or even better, to kill himself. - No. No. - You can't say that. - Like balmaceda did in Chile. Why not? Sure, I can. You're a Christian. Not that, Don Miguel... I'm "unamunian” and I can say anything I please. Well, as a Christian, I can't give you my consent. If you're so offended by what we say here, you should stay in your church. Enough already. I've been wanting to say this for a long time. You know what you are? A puritan. That's right. A puritan. No, atilano... You could have kept that last part to yourself. I just said I never keep quiet, neither does he, and you even less so. Quite a threesome we've gathered. We should be on the front shooting each other. Poachers, huh? School of the Evangelical church - Good afternoon, enriqueta. - Good afternoon. - Is atilano here? - Wasn't he with you? - Well, yes... - He's probably at home, I'll call him. No, no. There's no need. That I'll see him at the novelty tomorrow, like always. Of course, don't worry. But did you want something? No, no, nothing. That's all. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Asleep, he says... Me, asleep... Slackers! Troublemakers! Delinquents! That's what they called you! Living dead! But I didn't ask, I took you in with open arms! Well, with the one arm I have left! I offered you a chance. A new life, as gentlemen! That's why you have to die once again if necessary. Gentlemen legionnaires! Long live death!! Long live death! Long live millan astray! They love me like a father. What's more, they love me and so do the reds. Everybody loves me! Even the catalans love me! Boys! Go out there and die in combat. There's no greater honor. And die singing. I'm a man who fate... Clawed at like a beast. Death be my bride as I tie myself tightly to loyal company. When the going got tough and the fight got rough, defending their flag, the legion never stopped... Franco's general headquarters caceres long live the glorious cripple! That's me! Pepe... Pepe, you're not crying, are you? Here. Was Argentina good to you? Paco, I... I heard like a voice telling me: My legion! And I knew it was you. And here I am, ready to get back to work. Where are Carmen and your daughter? Not even my brother has that information right now. Say no more. We're advancing 25 kilometers a day. Wait. I see better this way. Seville... Mérida... badajoz... Paco, you had to come back from Africa to save all of their asses. Because that junta in burgos... - Don't say that. - Yes, you're way too modest. Tell me, paco. What do you want me to do? Look... blood is getting spilled here. But, as you well know, we need the smell to reach... Here. The propaganda... You can leave to me. And before you know it, we take Madrid. The reds will be in check, end of story. Well? You want to see it, huh? - I'm sorry, general, sir. - No, it's okay. Have a look. Take your time. Come closer, come closer... That's it. Come closer. Look closely. Look closely. Go on, back to work. "Don Miguel de unamuno is one of the most respected men of wisdom in Spain and the entire world. His prestigious literary and philosophical works are widely known and that is why we are proud of his fervent support for our sacred struggle. Rebel military junta burgos therefore, before the pettiness of those who take away what was granted not by them, but by god, as President of the national defense committee, I hereby decree: Sole article: Don Miguel de unamuno is reinstated as lifelong Dean of the university of salamanca." Nobody touched anything. We knew it would only last a few days. Me too. What are these? Those are the reports. What reports? - They didn't tell you? - No. As Dean, you are now president of the regional purging committee. What nonsense. I'm not a judge, much less a prosecutor. Who am I going to purge? Then you don't know about the manifesto either. For universities around the world. You'd only have to write a few words supporting the uprising... Propaganda is for the military, this is a teaching institution. Right. Actually general millan astray is handling propaganda now. Who? That cripple who howls more than Mussolini? I'm taking orders from him? They can exile me again. I stood up to the king, I can handle them. You'd only have to sign. I can write it myself. Look, ramos. Do as you please, but I refuse to go down in history as a Judas. Get these papers off my desk. Don Miguel! Please, come in. Good afternoon. Has anything happened to your husband? He hasn't come to the novelty... On Tuesday, when you came to the church, he didn't come home. That night I went to the civil guard and they said they had to ask him some questions. Atilano? But that was three days ago! Why didn't you say anything to me? Don Miguel, they'll let him go. Surely they'll realize. Realize what? Well, that they've made a mistake. Won't they? What did you want to tell him? What? When you came over. There was a reason, wasn't there? Something you knew and... No, nothing. Something silly. Things of ours. Things of ours. Could it be because he was involved in politics back in the day? We've all been involved in politics, you more than anyone. I don't know. He might have done something stupid. Something crazy. Now let's take Madrid and Barcelona! Jarriba espana! Jarriba espana! Atilano? Something crazy? He wouldn't hurt a fly. We have to go to city hall. Even better, the central government. And demand an explanation. You really think they'll give you one? Me? Of course. Why, because you're Miguel de unamuno? No, no. Those are rumors spread by the other side. Miguel, come back to earth already. They dragged Garcia lorca out of his house and shot him! They said so on the BBC. - On the BBC? - Yes. Haven't you figured it out yet? This isn't a return to order. This is fascism, just like in Italy and Germany! Let's go. Where? To the university. One second! Are you Miguel de unamuno? Yes, why? The real unamuno? Yes, what's the problem? What did I tell you? Sir, it's an honor. Can I have your autograph? Yes. - Salvador, please. - For gregorio aparicio, if you don't mind. - What for, you can't even read! - Shut up! Sir, you're very famous, aren't you? And this year - you almost got a nobel prize for writing. - Here you are. Thank you very much, sir. You make everyone proud. Jarriba espana! Ramos, where did I put them? They're not in my office. - What? - The committee reports. But... you said that... Dean, sir, you're a mystery to me. My habit used to say that. - Who? - My wife. Come on, come on. This can't be. What? Alfredo velarde. This boy was a student of mine. Arrested for joining the union. Look at this one. Arrested for not going to mass. If they caught you and me... Here it is. Atilano coco. Yes, but what's wrong with that? It was in england, when he was ordained a pastor. It's normal there, even the king is one. It's almost curfew. We have to go. And I think a lot of generals here are too. Don Miguel, now I really don't understand. Dad, there's nothing you can do. If atilano is a Mason, that's his own fault, right? Felisa, do you even know what masonry is? No and I don't care. Surely nothing good. It's no reason to arrest someone. Then why did they do it, Maria? Tell me. It's the conspiracy myth. Since the Jews don't have their own country, they want revenge. That's why they conspire to destroy nations. Their allies would be the masons and the communists. "A judeo-masonic-marxist conspiracy." But who would believe all that? Swine! Scoundrels! Infamy! It's infamy! Are we going to stand here watching the enemy's garbage with our arms crossed? Excuse me, general, sir. Your wife and daughter have arrived. For god's sake! We can't allow this! - Tell them to wait. - Yes, sir. We need to go there and stand up to them! Long live the alcazar of Toledo, damn it! We can't intervene. It would delay our entry into Madrid. Only a few days! Long enough for Russia to help the reds. And that would mean war... for years! Paco. A thousand of our men are in there. Pepe, the alcazar isn't a priority. Don't insist. The alcazar isn't on my route. Sole command. Now that's urgent. Mommy, can I play the piano? Or someone who only reads papers, like cabanellas. You know how I would solve the command issue? We go to burgos and tell that junta that the man in charge here is our general Franco. Leave the room. Yes, sir. You too. Yes, sir. Pepe, I can't just take command like I'm ordering more soup. I don't have enough support. Your problem is you're too modest. Maybe if we can get them to call a meeting for some other reason. And once we're there... Tactfully... Tactfully? Are you kidding me? We pound the table and that's that! Pepe, that's enough! You're all giving me a headache today. I don't have the support, damn it. Is he upset? Nicolas, you're his brother... Does he want it or not? What he doesn't want is to take a false step. Paco. Dismissed. - This palace doesn't have a chapel. - Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Do you know how important it is to pray? Now more than ever. Right. You must think I win battles only because you pray. We're going to rest. Come on, nenuca! Don't be angry, darling. I'll see what I can do. - Goodbye, daddy. - Goodbye, sweetheart. - Private. - Yes, sir. Remove the flag on the balcony and hoist this one. What's wrong? You don't recognize it? Of course, sir. It's the flag of the monarchy. The bicolored flag. The one we've always had. I open it and it reads: "Congratulations for fourth glorious injury. Stop. I eagerly await the fifth. Stop." Anyone know the lyrics? - To what, sir? - The royal march! Well, I know the lyrics from maestro marquina. Go on, we don't have all day! Glory, glory, pride in the fatherland. Sovereign light. The color of gold. - Life, life... - Long live Spain, heads high, sons of Spain, as it rises once again... Purple and gold, immortal flag. Your colors join flesh and soul. Purple and gold, desire and success. You are my flag, the sign of human zeal. Who followed the path of the sun across the blue sea. And tomorrow, the same in Seville. This will win over the royalists, and there are many. Like sanjurjo said: "That Franco is a fox, all right. Never let him out of your sight." I revolted to clean up the Republic, damn it, not to bring back the king. The Republic can't be helped anymore, general, with or without us. And what do you suggest? That everyone just do whatever they want? We're acting like the reds. We'll do the same as Franco. The flag of the monarchy in our squares. We need to stand together right now. Later on we'll see. Later on... We'll all meet. Anywhere. But everyone! Here they come. Miguel. Look. Cabanellas, mola... The one they're greeting is Franco, the one from Africa. The whole military junta. They aren't just passing through, something is cooking. Dean, sir. Yes. Here. Here I go. Then what do you propose? Mr. unamuno. I finally get to meet you in person. - Good morning, general cabanellas. - Gentlemen, here we have Spain's greatest writer: Don Miguel de unamuno. No, don't say that. I wanted to thank you for my reinstatement as Dean of the university. Of course, Don Miguel. Let me to introduce everyone. - General mola... - Pleasure. - Likewise. - General kindelan... - Nice to meet you. - General Franco... It's an honor to meet such a great spaniard. - Thank you. - And general millan astray. - The glorious cripple. - It's a pleasure, a pleasure. Anyway, since we're all here, did you know that I'm president - of the purging committee? - A great duty, yes, sir. Thank you. Well, there's an arrest that should be revoked. What did you say? It's a good friend of mine, atilano coco. - I'm sorry but now isn't the time. - Sure, but when? Don't worry, Don Miguel. We'll review his case. What did you say his name was? Atilano coco Martin. Gentlemen, I need you to take your places for the photograph. Come over, Don Miguel. Mr. unamuno. Do you remember that weekly journal you wrote in called "class struggle"? Those articles were really something. The struggle of the working class, the "atavistic" clergy... That was in my youth. I gave up socialism a long time ago. Well, not long ago you called my legionnaires "bullies" and "cutthroats." They work so hard to climb out of the stream and you have to drag them through the mud. My tongue gets the best of me sometimes. Anyway... Right now is when every spaniard, as you know, needs to rectify their mistakes and stand up for the cause. I'm referring to the manifesto I heard you don't want to sign. I'll leave it there. Look at the camera. Everyone hold still, please. My wife admires you very much, - excuse me? - One more. Nobody move... My wife. She admires you very much. What a bunch of fools. - Well, then? - They'll review the case. What did Franco say to you? - Who? - Franco. The one from Africa? That one... He's a pitiful man. - We fell into his trap. - What? He wants to talk about command. That's what he's after, command. You don't know him like I do. He's always up to something. Then we'll play along, cabanellas. And when he gets Madrid for us, we'll send him home. "Franco the little fox." As you all know, I see no pressing need for a single commander or "generalisimo” as some have suggested. I prefer a junta, as we have done so far. General, the first strategy wins a war. The second loses it. Very well. Then I will not vote. - Who will be the first? - I will. If I may, before you vote... One question, nothing more. Do you know what "baraka” means? When, less than two months ago, general sanjurjo, god rest his soul, was about to get on that plane, the pilot complained that his suitcase weighed too much. And it's no wonder. All of his medals were inside. Because sanjurjo was coming to Spain to lead the uprising. He should have been the generalisimo! Then... The plane wouldn't rise, it wouldn't take flight... Things got off to a bad start. Some might say it was the suitcase, others might say it was the pilot... Or just bad luck. Providential luck. That's "baraka."” my general and I fought together fifteen years ago, when I founded the legion in Africa. I never saw him tremble. Because Francisco Franco bahamonde knows no fear and he never will. But not only that. The bullets they shot at us, the bullets that took my eye, my arm and left me crippled... Didn't even graze him. They went right by him. They didn't even touch him. "Baraka," the moors called it. Gentlemen, that's what my general has. "Baraka." I'll leave it there. And now vote. "The university of salamanca knows that under such dramatic circumstances, it must raise its voice and denounce the cruelties... Denounce the unnecessary cruelties of the red hordes: Murders and useless destruction, bombing sanctuaries, hospitals and schools. Such actions reveal great cruelty... Such actions reveal great cruelty and destruction, - unnecessary and useless..." - Enough! What terrible writing! Give me that. Give me that! You destroy the Spanish language. What a heap of redundancy and nonsense! Then... You're going to sign it? Franco. Franco. Franco. It's your turn, general. Franco. Salamanca, September 20th, 1936 Mola, completely useless. Queipo de llano, a drunk. Cabanellas, a Mason, everybody knows that... Why wouldn't they vote for you, paco? They're nothing compared to you. What's wrong? Plenty of talk about the new generalisimo, but no real power, pepe. What about not making it public? They're laughing at us. I don't understand. Then why did they name you? It's exactly what I feared. What? A false step. - Don Miguel. - Enriqueta, I was on my way to your house. Good afternoon. I brought you this letter. I wrote it myself, explaining everything. No, listen... I made it clear atilano did nothing wrong. It's not necessary, they're going to review his case. They told me this morning. I knew they would listen to you. Don Miguel, you don't know how grateful I am. Excuse me. Goodbye. I am the wife of pastor atilano coco... Enriqueta, the letter! Enriqueta! Grandpa, will you make me a lion? A lion? I don't know how to make a lion. Here. A chimpanzee. - And stop all that shooting, boy. - Thank you! - No. Not now. - Dad... I can't. I can't help so many women. And all of them crying! Dad, they're women crying because their men are getting killed! What can I do about it? Denounce this massacre to the world! Write an article. You aren't moved? I'm not moved? - Your heart is made of stone. - Maria, don't talk to dad that way. His father is in Madrid, fighting for the Republic! And you, the "honorary citizen," still haven't done anything! Something for who, the reds? The ones calling me a traitor and saying I'm senile? The ones who shout and kill just like these ones? Dad! Just like these ones! Damn it. Oh, my god. Another drill. It doesn't matter. We have to take cover. Miguelin, hide in the closet. Aurelia! - Come on, dad. - No, I'm staying here. - Dad, please. - Leave me alone! If a bomb falls on me, who cares! Since I'm made of stone... Miguelin! - What are you doing here? - I wanted to be with you. You snuck out. If your aunts find out... Please, grandpa, don't tell them. Go on, sit there. And don't distract me. Grandpa... Why did you get angry with aunt Maria? Remember when your mother went away three years ago? She went to heaven. You lost a mother and I lost a daughter. And what happened after that? Grandma went too. She was my wife, but she called me "son." We were both left alone. Orphans. That was hard for us both, wasn't it? But that made us stronger. We have a tough heart, miguelin. But we're not made of stone. We feel. We care about other people. Isn't that right? That's why I got angry with aunt Maria. Go on. Hurry back, before you get caught. These walls have survived the unspeakable. For centuries. Even earthquakes. It would be a perfect air-raid shelter, your excellency. Maybe we should consult the Italians. The Germans. Better the Germans, they know these things. As far as my palace, it would be an honor to offer it to the cause. Believe me, this is not a war anymore, it's a crusade. When will you be moving headquarters? Sooner than later, your excellency. Salamanca is the perfect location. Excuse me. Nicolas. You need to convince him about the alcazar. El cid. What a great man, general. Not like the vulgar politicians nowadays. A Christian knight. Absolutely right. That's what made us an empire. Nicolas. I'm doing this wrong. Paco, don't say that. - Hey, stop thinking about the junta. - No, no. All wrong. From the beginning. I'm... rushing things. And what do I win? The war? To go back to my barracks and in a few years the weeds will grow back. And another brawl all over again. Spain is like that. Always a brawl. I'm sending the troops to the alcazar. Paco... If you do that, you'll be a hero, but... Spain needs heroes. But you'd be giving up Madrid, right when it's about to fall. - The war will last for years. - Years. That's what I'm saying. It will take years to clean this up. And what will you tell people? What will they fight for when they get sick of burying their dead? For you? Western Christian civilization And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now and at the hour... Of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Franco, Franco, Franco! Franco, Franco, Franco! Here he is! A Christian knight, like El cid! A caudillo! Let the reds come for us now! Let them come! Let them come and see what we can do under the shade of this flag! - Long live death! - Long live! Long live Franco! Franco, Franco, Franco! And you should see their faces. For them Franco is the only choice. Then he can tell them how long the war is going to last. Turn that down! General cabanellas. - We demand another meeting in salamanca. - Make it tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow? You heard me. We need to designate his powers once and for all. The uprising is now a holy and glorious war, like those which guided the great saviors of the fatherland! Jarriba espana! Jarriba espana! Jarriba espana! Don Miguel, it's your turn. "Iarriba espana!" And they think they're saying something. Wouldn't it be better to turn off the radio? What are they saying now? One fatherland! One state! One caudillo! I don't know. "Caudillo," I think. Caudillo? - Where are you going? - To the novelty, to make paper figures. - Salvador! - What are you doing? - Where were you? - In the park reading. What's wrong? - Have they released atilano? - Come on. - No, the novelty is full of fascists. - Then somewhere else. Where? How should I know? Zamora! You were joking about zamora, right? We'll go to China if we have to. It's impossible to breathe here. Can we turn back now, please? At least we still have this. - What? - The countryside. The air. The sun. - Spain. - "Spain." People. Chatting with friends. They can't take that away from us. Chatting? In this country? You mean arguing. And with you, even worse. I used to come here with concha, my habit. She and I used to argue a lot, since we were kids. "I don't understand you," she used to say, "and your books even less." Yeah, well... Does anybody understand you? A marxist, a socialist... Now they're saying a fascist. Atheist, Christian, agnostic... Make up your mind. - Make up my mind? - Yes. Make up your own damn minds! Make up your own minds! Why can't you just admit it for once? - What? - That you change! That today you think one thing and tomorrow something else! That you're wrong sometimes! Me? Yes. You were wrong about all of this. You supported the right without asking what they were going to do. And what about you leftists, who promised us the world while you led us to disaster? You weren't wrong? No, not you! You're never wrong! We leftists are trying to get Spain out of the middle ages! This decrepit Spain that reeks of incense and sacristy, where the poor are only free to stay poor. Poor and illiterate! Son, you leftists fill your mouths with freedom, but you have no problem swallowing Stalin's dictatorship! Please. All this Republic has shown me is revenge, hate and resentment! Revenge! I was talking about the Republic, not Stalin! - Why bring up Stalin now? - Look, kid. Why do we always have to talk about what you want? If our side is so terrible, why are you here right now fleeing from the other side? Come on, son. Let's go back. Let's go back. Salvador vila? Yes. What's going on? Come with us. Why? Let's go. I haven't done anything wrong. Who are you? Hey, hey! Get in the car! - What are you doing, you bastard? - What's going on here? Wait a minute. I'm unamuno. Friends with this red? Maybe you want to go with him. That's right. Stay there, look down and turn your back. Until we're gone. Got it? What did I say? Dad, where have you been? - You look awful. - What if you caught a cold? - Awful! - It's almost October! I'll make him something. The mayor's widow came by. She wants to talk to you. She's in the living room. Dad, I told her not to let her in, but... Three children. I never thought I'd be in such a situation, but without casto's salary... Two months ago you offered me money. And now I would be... I'm willing to accept it. Look, Ana... You can't imagine how sorry I am about... I never, ever imagined that... That this would degenerate into... I have problems too now, and... Yes, I offered, but right now I can't... I can't help you. Of course you can't. But you helped the uprising before, didn't you? Five thousand pesetas. You know what they spent that money on? Buying guns, like the one that killed my husband! That's right, with your money! Your hands are as bloody as theirs! Every death is yours! You're a murder...! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The day they arrested you... When they exiled you. I said: "Why won't you give in? Why don't you withdraw your criticism of the king?" "Do it for me," I said. And you said: "Darling. Why do you think I won't give in? I won't give in for you. For my children." It took me so long to understand. And now, now that I finally do... Now is precisely when... University of salamanca manifesto in support of the uprising This is much more than we agreed on. We said generalisimo, not commander in chief. That would give Franco both military and political power. It would give him Spain! So? - S07? - All right. Look. Add this here: "While at war." Commander in chief "while at war." Gentlemen, let's hurry up. They're waiting for us at the barracks. - I have to go to the front. - Go ahead, don't worry. Nicolas. Today could be the most important day of my life. I know. You can go, paco. Don't worry. Grandpa, are you going to die? Don't be silly. Go on, go and play. I don't want to leave you alone, grandpa. It's better this way. I don't belong out there. Everyone wants me to do something. What can I do? I can't... I can't stop a war. But they don't... They don't understand me. They don't understand me. I understand you. Wait a second. It's not here. The reference to the war. "While at war." Remember? General kindelan proposed it. How many people touched the draft? How many? Everyone. What are you insinuating, general? I want to talk to general mola. General mola left hours ago. Get him on the line. - But cabanellas... - You don't realize what we're doing. I had him under my command. If you ordered Franco to take a hill, nobody could ever move him from there. If we give him Spain now, he won't let go until he dies. I'm telling you, I know him well. Well, and he knows you. What do you mean? Now is not the time to bicker among ourselves, general. We all know each other. I still don't understand you. You're a Mason, or aren't you? Look. It's two in the morning and we have a war to win. Sign it and later on we'll see. Concha... My love, my habit! He's asleep. That's not me. That's someone else. Hold me. - Hold me! - Miguel. My son. Wake up. Finally! Dad. You've been delirious for two days. - How do you feel? - Fine, fine. What a scare you gave us. What a scare. Felisa! You're not one to be scared, darling. Certainly not you. They've started classes again and me here, at home. From now on forget about everything else. That's enough. And eat something. Franco, commander in chief? Since yesterday. And they moved headquarters here, to the bishop's palace. - Two of a kind... - Maria, please, don't get him started. I'm still in time. What did he say? And a tie. Now a tie? Dad, you've never worn a tie. Then the one I wore to the speech at Oxford! Do you really think he'll listen to you? Of course. He's the most sensible one. Sensible? That's not what you said when you met him. It isn't? What did I say? A pitiful man! Wow, you're all against me again. Try to talk to his wife, and look her in the eye. - To his wife? Why? - They say she's very Christian. I'm sure she'll understand you. Oh, god... please, not now... At least tell him I'm here, damn it! There's nothing I can do! But he knows me! He knows me! I won't say it again! Get out of here! That's enough! You can't treat me like this! Nobody can! Don Miguel! It's me, gregorio, you gave me your autograph. How could they not let you in? Tell him that. Mr. unamuno, you have no idea how much we admire you. Isn't that right, paco? Especially for your Christian poetry. The other things... - Sure you wouldn't like some coffee? - No, thank you, ma'am. - A pastry? - No, thank you, thank you. Look, general... sorry, excellency... Didn't do anything wrong, because honestly I don't know. What did you say his name is? Salvador vila, professor of literature at the university. Find out where he is. Yes, your excellency. Thank you. Thank you very much. He's like a son to me. He was my student, you know. Anyway, since I'm here talking to you... Allow me to deliver this letter. It's from atilano coco's wife. He's an Evangelical pastor and also a close friend of mine. I was told he would be released, but... I've already heard about this gentleman. He's a protestant and a Mason. A bad spaniard. But he... hasn't committed any crime. And there are plenty more like him. Plenty. And the reasons, frankly... Not to mention all the "walks" at night... And executions without a trial. And what do you think the other side does? You think they don't do anything? I know, I know... I know they do. But we're christians. Indeed, we take care of the enemy. Before they die, the prisoners are given the chance to confess. Which means they can go to heaven. The other side not even that. Do you go to mass, Don Miguel? Mass? Your excellency... Thank you. Yes. Your friend is being held by the nationals. But you are the nationals. Don Miguel. That's enough. Enriqueta. Remember that day I came looking for atilano? You know what? Actually, I only wanted to apologize. Apologize for... Something stupid I said to him. I called him... I called him a puritan. And I told him to go back to his church and... I think he got angry and... I really wish I could have said I was sorry. And now it will never happen. Don Miguel, he will have already forgiven you. Come closer. Come closer. Closer. You'll like it, you'll see. It works on kids every time! - Did you hurt yourself? - No. Good afternoon, Don Miguel. I came only for a minute of your time. - Would you like to sit down? - No. I'm not an armchair man. Well, well, well. We missed you this morning. Where? Where do you think, Don Miguel? It's Sunday. At the cathedral. I was under the weather. Okay. But you need to recover quickly. You can't miss tomorrow. The day of the race, no less. At the university. Your temple. General millan astray, I attended that absurd celebration once, unfortunately. The exaltation of the race sounds to me like the same thing as Nazi aryanism and its sad sequel, anti-semitism. A sham. Look, - I won't argue these matters with you. - I expected no less. You intellectuals make me laugh. Always so brave, so upstanding, always trying to change the world. But from home. From your books. From your trench. While we... The bullies, the cutthroats, risk our lives, our souls, on the front line of combat. General, bravery is not only shown in combat. Very true. Our caudillo cannot attend the ceremony tomorrow and he expressly requested that you attend in his place. Why don't you go and tell him what you told me? That it's a sham. You tell him. Be brave. I'll leave it there. They're here. Dad. If you talk today, they'll have you shot. Don't say anything, you hear me? My girl, you of all people telling me that. Here. Didn't you want a lion? Give it to me when you get back. They're arriving. All right, follow me, please. The distinguished dofia Carmen will preside at the table, accompanied by his excellency the bishop and our Dean on one side. On the other, Don José millan, Don José Maria ramos and Don José Maria peman. Maestro, you should say a few words. You're such a good speaker. No, no. I know myself. My tongue gets the best of me. Who until now have been living at the expense of other spaniards. Catalonia and the basque country are a cancer and the anti-Spain! Which is why we should cut off the rotten flesh with the cold scalpel of burning patriotism! - Jarriba espana! - Jarriba! Dignitaries, my dear audience. The Spanish empire, refuge of the historic essence of the race, endures today more than ever in the merciless fight against those who only wish to destroy our sacrosanct civilization. There are moments when a man's spirit, or that of an entire people, needs to imperiously concentrate its spiritual energy upon the acts of pure heroism of their main historical figures... That's right! Or those of their nation. I am the wife of pastor atilano coco. He's accused of being a Mason and actually he is. Finally reaching the glory we deserve, which, without a doubt, is always granted to the brave. My boys, let us build in our hearts an alcazar of Toledo! I said I didn't want to speak because I know myself. But I've been provoked and... Since silence can be taken as consent, I have to do it. The defense of western Christian civilization was mentioned here today. I myself created the expression. I was wrong. This war is anything but civil, a collective suicide between those who favor fascism and bolshevism, which are nothing but two sides, concave and convex, of the same mental illness. May I speak? I just heard insults against catalans and basques, calling them a cancer and anti-Spanish, but they could very well say the same about us. There's no such thing as the anti-fatherland. We're all Spanish and we all have to fight together. Without each other, Spain would be mutilated. An amputee with one eye like general millan astray, an invalid of war. May I speak? And here is his grace the bishop who, like it or not, is catalan, and who could very well teach some people here a little Christian doctrine, which you apparently don't know. Meanwhile, I'm basque, and I have no problem teaching you Spanish, which you don't know either. I want to speak! Spain! One! Spain! Great! Spain! Free! Long live millan astray! Long live death! Long live death! "Long live death." That's like saying "death to life." As an expert in paradoxes, I assure you I've never understood that one. Long live death a thousand times. And death to the intellectuals! Please, don't... Traitors. Death to the intellectual traitors. Millan astray, this is the temple of intelligence! My temple! To vanquish is not to convince. To conquer is not to convert. You will conquer because you have brute force, but you will never convince because to convince you need to persuade. You will conquer but you will never convince. I have spoken. - Red! - Traitor! Son of a bitch! Don Miguel! My hand! My hand, take my hand! Unamuno! Take the hand of our commander in chief's wife. Get us out of here. Don't let go. Face the sun with your new shirt that yesterday you embroidered in red. You really couldn't keep your mouth shut, Don Miguel? Why didn't you stay quiet? All my husband wants is for Spain to be a quiet place, where people don't shout and fight. That's all we want for Spain. Peace. For god's sake, a peaceful Spain. Francisco Franco won the war in 1939 and imposed a military dictatorship. Despite the defeat of fascist regimes in world war il, Franco managed to stay in power until his death in 1975. Salvador vila and atilano coco were executed without a trial. After his speech, Miguel de unamuno was dismissed again as Dean and placed under police surveillance. He died of a heart attack two months later. On June 15th 1977 Spain held Democratic elections once again.
