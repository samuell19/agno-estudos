What were you thinking? I was short of 20 yen. That's no reason to leave the shop without paying. I'm sorry. Yes but it's up to the police now, right? As it's such a small sum... Maybe you can sort it out. You see, my dad isn't all there... That's besides the point. What a miser...! Shut up! Stop chomping. It's gross. Why are you cranky? I got a call from the cops when I was getting dinner! Stop chomping! Maybe your jaw's broken. Jaws don't break, they dislocate. Whoa, you're angry. Let's go home, it's freezing! Come on! You know what? I saw him. Who? No Name.- Who? The fugitive on TV! Terumi Yamauchi. Oh, him. I saw him on the train this morning. You doubt me? It wasn't him. He took off his mask to bite his nails so I saw his face! It was him! It was not. - He fled from Tokyo to Osaka. - No way! There's a 3-million-yen reward out for him! Focus on work and quit dreaming. Imagine if we had that kind of money! I won! Who's competing? Won't you sleep? When I close my eyes I see all these horrible things... Like what? It's hard to say... Like... about Mom? I only have good memories about your mom. Go to sleep. I'll beat you to it. - Want to sleep with Dad? - That's creepy. Kaede. You want to play ping pong? Yeah. Let's do that some time. Good night. Dad? MISSING The number you dialed is either disconnected or out of area. Hi, Kaede. You didn't pack a lunch today? I had no time. What's wrong? Leave me alone. That bread looks good. Do you, uh... Is there a boy you like? No. Why? So... what do you think of me? Girls' comics are so cheesy. That a rebuff? It's bad timing! What? Wait a moment. Where are you going? I'm serious. This is a dare, isn't it? It's not a dare! Wait! Like I said I'm dead serious! Don't walk away. Wait, Kaede Harada! Sorry but I don't remember every worker's face... Oh really. - What's his name? - Harada. - First name? - Satoshi. Let's see, Satoshi Harada... Satoshi Harada... He's signed up today. Where is he? I can't tell you. It's no place for kids. Come on, tell me. Wait at home. He'll turn up sometime. You guys, take it outside! Hey, don't... Come on. Is Satoshi Harada here? Satoshi Harada! Let me help... Don't shout, I can hear you. Answer me then! Answer me then! Harada! Dad. What...? Uh... are you Satoshi Harada? I'm sorry. I'm looking for someone else. Same name? It is a common name. Help me get this down. Come on. Bye. Get in. You've had no contact? Nothing. His phone has been switched off. Do you have relatives in town? No I don't. And you can't reach any of them? What's the best plan of action... You tell me. Wait a minute... "Osaka Police, Nishinari Precinct"Let me see... I know that face. Is he the one who was acting out? What...? What's that about? It was about 6 months ago... He was drunk as a skunk. It was a real hullabaloo! I don't think it was him. Really? Doesn't he drink at that place behind the station? Did you ask those people there? My dad doesn't drink. All grownups around here drink. Even alley cats, right teacher? Well... Can you ask those people for her? If someone saw him being abducted or if there was some kind of crime, I could do something but... Oh... No trouble with the neighbors? No. - No notes? - No. Money trouble? Money... maybe. Is he in debt? Are there any other possibilities? There are only so many scenarios for missing adults... Samples for missing person fliers are in the hall. Oh, we have to make them? You should, if you're in a hurry. I'll put this in our file. Okay. Thank you very much. Let's go. "Shin-Imamiya Station" Help us find him. "Shin-Imamiya Station" Help us find him. "Shin-Imamiya Station" Have you seen him? Take one. Help us find him. Take a flier. Thank you. Please. What's wrong, Kaede? This is no good. It's game over. I'm done. You owe me fried chicken! Shit... He left me because he's not my real dad. That's not true... I knew it. We don't have the same eyes or blood type... and he smells. That means nothing. I'm sure your father has his reasons. You think he won't come back! You want this to end! I don't think like that. Then how can you be so cruel? You make no sense! I've always thought you were fake! How dare you say that? After all I've done! I paid for these fliers out of my own pocket! Hey, stop that. Whoa! Hold it. Idiot! - Damn Dad! - I'm going. She's yours. But... wait! Good-for-nothing father! That's enough. Stupid asshole! "Don't look for me. I'm fine. Dad" "Bites nails..." What? He was at the construction site. He looks similar... but he's not wearing glasses. A 3-million-yen reward... Wait for me! "Wanted: Terumi Yamauchi" So your dad went after him for the reward? Right. - To repay debts? - Yes. And why would this fugitive take your dad's identity? Well that's... It needs to be investigated. Many people claim to haveseen No Name... It's true－ We're following every lead. Wasn't your dad caught shoplifting the other day? Who are you looking for anyway? What an asshole! "Ping Pong Club" Are we allowed in here? It used to be Dad's. He wants it back but he can't afford the rent. Cool... Get a chair. "No Name, murder" "The Tama murder case" This is it. "8 victims identified!" He is out of control... "His victims were hung and then mutilated." Shit, with a hacksaw! He found preys on social media. He has so many accounts... No Name has fake identities? Looks like it. A video! Ready? Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Teru Happy birthday to you! Drink some water. Drink more. Why do you believe that things get better? - Life isn't as beautiful as you think.- You're right. Stop! Sorry I left but I had to pick up my daughter. I could've picked her up! Hi. Come on in. - I saw it! - Bingo! Thank you. Your friend is here! - You got them! - Demolished! Here. It's strawberry. Who wants one of jellies Daddy bought? Is there strawberry? Kaede got that. Yes, that's hers. Choose one. If I can't have strawberry, I won't have anything. So you won't get anything then. I want strawberry! Calm down. - OK, 2 jellies or strawberry? - That's my choice? - Yes. - Strawberry. Wrong answer! It's tasty. Soya beans and seaweed go well together. It smells appetizing! They are amazing together. Hello. - Hello! - Yes? Is he here? Satoshi Harada. Wasn't he the wrong man? Just tell me. I haven't been here since that day. You know where he lives? No. I avoid talking to Japanese people. How about me? You're just a kid. So it's OK? I think you should stay away from that guy. Why? He's creepy... his eyes have a glazed look. He isn't normal. He must be possessed by something. By what? I don't know. Sometimes you meet guys like him in places like this... I have to ask him something! We once caught the same train. He got off at Imaike. I'm not sure if it's helpful but... Next stop is Imaike. Hey! Hey! Yes? - What do you want? - Sorry, I made a mistake. Kaede! I'm glad I found you. Wait a minute! What are you doing here? I'm looking for Dad! But he texted you, didn't he? Leave me alone! Sister Maizuru said that you can stay at St. Marianne Orphanage. Hello, Kaede. We wasted time waiting for you at school! I heard your story. I've looked after many children like you. So let me be honest with you. Your father will not come back. Let's try to accept reality and move forward. You must feel sad, defeated and emotional－ What do you think you're doing? - Stop, Kaede! - Let me go! Who... are you? Where's my dad? Your dad? Satoshi Harada. Oh... Where is he? That's paid content. Did you kill him? Stop right there! Stop! Someone, stop him for me! - Let me use your bike! - Return it later. I said stop! Stop! Wait! Go away! Stop! Damn it! Stop right now! I told you to stop! - Stop him! - Shit... I said stop running! What's going on? Stop. Stop... Are you hurt? I'm OK... Hey! You forgot something! Thanks. "Ferry ticket" Karinto island? Yes. I can't come with you. Ask the police for help. No! Dad's with this guy. He had Dad's phone! Don't get in too deep. You'll get killed. OK, I'll be... your girlfriend. If you come with me. Really? Yes. But... I don't know. Please! Show me your tits then. Uh... why? Coz you're my girl! So you lied just so I'd come?How sneaky of you－ Okay, I got it! Hey! You can't touch. Sorry. You've got to promise me. Your nose. Slow down! - He's nowhere. - Yeah. It's so dark... He won't be here. You have any idea? No. Huh...? What now then? - Let's go back. - Be quiet! Wait! Keep out. - Kids, stop! - Let us pass. Who are you? Stop. - Dad...! - You can't go in there. - That's my dad! - Don't enter... - Dad! - Stop. - No kids in here! - Dad! - Stop! - Dad, Dad. That's my dad! Dad! When I was 4, Dad took me to see our house being built. I watched from the car. I ate a Homerun bar ice candy.It was vanilla. Why did you tell me that? That's my earliest memory. You told me yours, Starling.About seeing the ocean. Well, mine's not reliable. I wish it were a nicer beach than this. It's for you, don't complain. It's an opinion, not a complaint. You come across differently in your texts. Everyone does. Is that enough? Your phone. - Now? - Yes. OK. Let's go. 3 months ago Want this? It'll relax you. OK, close your eyes. - What's that? - Be quiet. In here. Right. I'll check inside. In the night I often hear a woman crying in this apartment. I see. It smells strange. Is anyone here? Anyone home? Answer me please! I'm coming in! This is private property. Maybe no one's here. You can't－ Oh my God! Wait! Hey! Where are you from? Tokyo. I'm doing research for my novel. You are? I'll take you to a place with great views. No, it's OK. Isn't this the best view? I guess so. Where will you sleep tonight? Wherever... At the lighthouse? Don't stay there. That place has ghosts. I don't believe in them. What's your name by the way? Osamu Nakajima. Dad named meafter Osamu Dazai. Really? It's a great name. Don't you have a girlfriend, Osamu? I wouldn't have come here if I did. You have a point. I've got some goodies. What's your preference? That's not my kind of thing. Let me guess. You've never got laid? Fuck off. Why not then? I don't like girls who move. What? You like this? I have that type too. "Snakes and Ropes" Well? Good, right? Not really. Oh, not again. I'll get a bucket. "Ulysee: Is charcoal-burning suicide easy?" "Umbrella: I have someone who wants to meet you." "Home run! You won a free ice candy" Attention, passengers. This ferry is bound for Kobe. Stay in line. Bring your bowl over for seconds. We dated for 3 years and were married for 14 years. She was my everything. How do you feel? OK, I'm putting you down. Thank you. 13 months ago - She's back. - Nice weather. It is! OK, up we go! - Thank you! - Take care! Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, otherwise known as ALS. Or Lou Gehrig's disease. Since my wife had this disease with all its names, she has not smiled even once. It's almost done. It's OK. Everything is OK. Very good. There you go. There! Good night. You must be tired. Sleep well. Good night. Yes, Honey? I... think I'd rather be... dead. Whoa, what are you talking about? While I'm asleep... kill me. Honey, let's not say that. It'll be... good for you too. Come on, stop that. Everything will be OK, Kimiko. It'll be OK. That's the girl. You're going to be OK. Let's take it easy, Kimiko. Reach out with your left hand... Slowly... - Are you OK, Kimiko? - Is she OK? Are you OK? Let's try to get up. Does it hurt? Are you OK? What's wrong? Huh? Kimiko... It must be tough on her. Well, yeah... If you need someone to talk to, I'm here. No thank you. I'm OK. Whoa, what are you trying to do? Are you OK? Oh dear... It's OK... I'll help you up. "kimipon: My husband seems like a stranger... I have no dignity." "I want to play ping pong with my daughter again." "I'm supposed to be 'grateful' even though I'm suffering." "I didn't choose to have ALS." "I'm in pain every moment. I want to die but no one takes me seriously." "I want to die while I'm still myself. Enough pain." I see... Actually I'm more worried about you. You can't take it all on. You're healthy. There's so much that you can do. No, no. I'm holding it together pretty well. Make the most of your own life, Mr. Harada. Well... Two types of people come to this facility. Those who really want to live and... those who are alive only because of the people around them. That just makes everyone unhappy. Everyone sinks into a swamp. Meanwhile they spend so much time and money... Only death delivers them all. What's the meaning of it? I can deliver her. "Nishinari Ping Pong Club" Hey, we'll play ping pong again, right? The 3 of us will play ping pong. With Kaede... You ready...? You'll stay? No. It's over. That's 200,000 yen. You didn't think I'd go through this for free, did you? Something like this is definitely paid content. Later... not now. Let me keep your driver's license just in case. Now. Can I use the toilet? This is my last day here. Oh really. I have to go back to Tokyo. Mr. Harada, can I have a word? Let's do it again. What? There are so many people in the world who want to die. They want to but they can't express it. They deserve to be delivered. What are you saying? You want to kill them? That's bullshit. It isn't. We'll save them. Like we saved your wife. - She's not related－- She is. Your wife smiled at the end. I wish you'd seen her... So you shouldn't feel guilty. Mr. Harada. It'll be you and I. It's salvation, not murder. Out of compassion. - Bullshit. - Wait! You can find them on the net. - You do it! - 2 is better than 1. Go away! You'll be paid. - I gave it to you! - You deserve it. No! I know you need it... The money. Kimiko. She wanted to play ping pong again. Reopen the ping pong club for her. What Yamauchi told me was true. "I wanna die..." For various reasons people in this world "Die with me." want to die. You'll manage 6 accounts. Hangman, Ulysee, Takefumi, Zetton, Clione and Hiroshi. Text the targets on different accounts. If you need a new account, buy one from an auction site. I have to go. "Hangman" I have a reply from a target. "I'm still nervous to die." Write back, "We'll die together." What? I won't actually die but it's just so she'll relax and trust me. I find the targets and make plans for them to meet. Yamauchi meets them and carries out the deed. He also disposes of them. I received it but... Good. Is this the amount you promised me? I meant to tell you that she was young and short of money. I found more than one for you... I'm grateful. I just helped Nyako depart very peacefully. Right... It's not about money, is it? I know but... Dad, what are those colorful things? Bath salts. - Bath salts? - Yes. Could have fooled me. Hello? Let's celebrate with a drink next time we meet. Is it a deal? Okay... Goodbye. They're cookies! Yum. Don't worry. It's going to be OK. There's nothing to be scared of. It'll be OK. It won't take long. You want to die? Police are looking at a possible serial killing after finding 8 bodies in picnic coolers in an unused Tokyo apartment. Terumi Yamauchi is a suspect－ Where's your driver's license? What's up? I forgot. Tomorrow then. Wipe the floor. Out of desperation I came up with a plan. You know what? I saw him. - Who? - No Name. Who? The fugitive on TV! Terumi Yamauchi. Oh, him. I saw him on the train this morning. He took off his mask to bite his nails so I saw his face. How have you been? Mr. Harada. You'll sleep in here. Do you remember Starling? Who's that? This woman. Oh... that one. She jumped from her apartment a month ago. See? She broke both of her legs. "Tama Killer survivor attempts suicide!" She's in a wheelchair. So? She contacted me. To die? Yes. OK, I see... She'll pay. How much? About 3 million yen. What? She wouldn't have 3 million. It must be a police trap! How about I go to Tokyo and check? If it's real I'll bring her to you. With the money, you can get a fake passport or a face job. Take these. Wear these and go here "Labor Center" to work. If I don't make it back, use the money to escape. Take my phone just in case. I'll call you from a public phone. You've got a lot to say tonight. What? This speech sounds like it's been rehearsed. What kind of bullshit is that? My life's at stake! If you're arrested that's the end of me, too! Hey, what are you doing? Hey. Don't do that, hey. This is to prove my good faith so you'll trust me. You don't have to do that. Stop. OK I trust you, so stop. You idiot. "MISSING: Satoshi Harada" "WANTED: Terumi Yamauchi" Here. Thank you. Starling. Starling. Are you going to eat all of that? Of course. But I eat it and throw it all up. OK then－ Excuse me but do I have to stay in this hotel? The guest next door is noisy, it's dusty and the shower pressure's low... - Sorry. - What's it cost? I'll find another hotel. Forget it! Good night. Good night. She's alone. It's not a trap. Mr. Harada. Yes? You were a good choice. Oh? To be honest I thought you'd make a good fall guy so I brought you in. And now... I'll be executed if I'm caught. I'll logout. Hold on... I'll make sure that you escape. - So... - Don't worry. I won't tell them about you. I owe you. It's tasty. Soya beans and seaweed go well together. It smells appetizing! They are amazing together. So you lied just so I'd come?How sneaky of you－ Okay, I got it! Hey! You can't touch. Sorry. Someone else got here first. Oh... Someone else? What do you mean? "Starling" Hello？ Let me talk to him. OK. Hello. Change of plans. Come to Karinto island. What's wrong? Get a ferry from Kobe tomorrow. Sorry, we'll do it tomorrow. Why? Things happen. Forget it! Still bleeding? No, I'm OK. Let's stop. I can't trust you, I'm going home. You useless lackey... It's your responsibility to take me from A to B. It's a simple job, you idiot! Any idiot could do it. Come on! OK, let's go back to the hotel. Shut up and do it, moron. - Excuse me. - Yes? The woman who was here... She checked out. No! You almost killed her! I'm so sorry! I'm fine! - Don't just leave! - Let go! I wanted to wear something nice so... - What? - Nothing. Don't scare me. - Is it something I did? - No. - What then? - It's OK. What is it? I'm fine. Are you sick? - No. - Is it me? No. Let me finish it. You smell like my dad. "Occupied" "Unoccupied" Where are we? Some guy's house. Got the money? It's yours. Go outside. You're the lookout. OK. I'm glad the ocean is pretty this time. Don't be sarcastic. Thank you. You're the first. No one else actually wanted to die. It's my honest wish. You're doing the right thing. No one needs me... You're wrong. None of us are needed. It's no good... What? Do your bit. We're fucked! Someone's here. I tried to stop them... Take this. What the fuck? No one's here... Ouch! What the fuck? You...! What the... Damn it! What the hell? Police? Can you come? I was stabbed. In my stomach... with a kitchen knife. I don't know the address... Right now! Come right now. Kill me... No... No. That's not right. Kill me. No, no... Oh, no... This isn't right. Please. Strangle me. - Dad! - Stop. No kids in here! Dad! Stop! That's my dad! Dad! Are you OK? Can you hear me? Kaede... Calm down. Dad! Why are you here? Ouch... That hurts... - Dad. - Is he OK? He's OK. I saw Yamauchi one morning on the train. It was like, oh my God, he's in my town. I got obsessed with the reward money. What with my kid growing up and all. I couldn't get full-time work with my depression so... I've been diagnosed. So you left home to find him? Yes. But he got me instead. He took my wallet, phone, my cards... He even took my work clothes. He made me bring her... I had no option. - Lieutenant Jinnai. - Yes? Is Harada telling the truth? His accounts are consistent... He might have staged his injuries for the money. And stabbed himself? He has defensive injuries... The victim withdrew money that day. It was to pay the killer but we didn't find it. How much? "Home run! You won a free ice candy" 63,000 yen. Who'd go to that trouble for so little money? I guess so... Will he get the reward money? Well... I'm not sure how that'll go. - Ready? - Yes. That's no good. Your grip is wrong. It is? Not like this. More like this. And like this. Try it. - Good. - Thank you. Hello. You got an ice candy? Dad got a winning Home run stick. Want to play? Again? - You want to be a ping pong player. - No way! No one comes... It's a pointless trade. It's okay. Do not seek out meaning. Here. There are better ways to use the reward... "With gratitude to Satoshi Harada whose help was indispensable." "He helped solve the Tama serial murder case." You swing back... and hit it. Knees bent, and lean forward. "You're logging into Pigeon." "ERROR: account suspended." "Manatee" "Hello, Manatee. I have a new account." "I need your help." Stand there with your body twisted. That's good. I missed it! I was too slow... Let's go. - Ready? - I'll nail it. "Manatee: How can I help you?" "Thanks for the reply. Tell me an easy way to go." The teacher wants to see you next week. About what? I think it's about high school next year. You have any ideas? Wherever I'm accepted. Aim higher than that! I don't have to. Hang the laundry! "Tell me an easy way to go." "You want to die?" "Yes." "I can die with you." Kaede. I'll go and pick up something. How about ping pong? I won't be long. OK. Come again! "Tsutenkaku Tower Observatory Entrance" Hi, I'm here! Dad, you came home with nothing. I couldn't find... what I wanted. What did you want? I don't know... I forgot. You can't forget. About me. About Mom and everything... They're coming for you. Why? This is goodbye. Kaede. The no-show at the Tower... Was that you? Yes. I know what kind of man you are. I know what you did. I found you out. I won this time. Who's competing?
