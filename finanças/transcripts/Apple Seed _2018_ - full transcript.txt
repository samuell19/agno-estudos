- Yes, hello? Yeah, this is, yes, Prince McCoy. Right, my dad and I own the hotel on the corner. Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm just callin' to get in, right, about the extension. Three months, possibly. Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know. I know we have a couple of times. We, really it's a big job and we're just... Yes. Yeah, please have him call me back. Thank you. - Hey, Prince. - Hey. - What you doin'? - Oh, it's gettin' late, I'm gonna go see my girl. - You got any cigarettes? - You shouldn't smoke. - Come on. - Here. - What's that? - Some toy my mom gave me when I was like 12. - This the best she give you? - That's as good as it got. See ya. Jenny broke up with me. I mean, I knew it was comin', I just didn't know it was gonna be tonight. I talked to the bank again today. Ain't budgin', Dad. Like it was like, it wasn't Gail this time. It was somebody else. They keep passin' me on down the line and... How many years you been bankin' there? Hey, where's the loyalty, you know? Place was there ever since I was a kid. Maybe it's time we moved to some other bank. Just move to some other town or something. This is gettin' ridiculous, Dad. You know what I mean? Come on. We gotta talk about this. Dad? Dad? - Do you have a girlfriend? - She just broke up with me. - Was she like, the one? - Actually, this is the one. - She's hot. You used to be, too. - All those years of loyalty, and they just took the only thing my dad and I ever owned. - Oh, that's mean. I hate stuff like that. When I was little, I hated monsters. But I liked clowns. - Yeah. That bank is a big monster with a big ugly dragon that swallowed up the rest of my family. It wasn't much, but it's all I had. - You know the thing about dragons, right? What does every dragon need? A knight to slay it. You gonna slay that dragon. - Nice vehicle. These wheels are gonna get you places. You know, when I was a kid, I always enjoyed the circuses. Well, howdy. You don't even have a pot left to piss in, son. That's an awful lot of trash to be draggin' around with ya. - But this is my personal stuff. - Oh. You know, once I had to sell my only suit for a few cans of beans and a loaf of bread. Turned out to be the best tastin' beans and loaf of bread ever sank my chops into. - Yeah, right. - Howdy, again. - So, uh, where you headed? - Well, I'm waitin' for the next train tomorrow, but I'm real antsy to get started on my trip to Nova Scotia. - You got somethin' against flying? - Well, doctor says I shouldn't. Heart might not make it. - Altitude? - Stewardesses. - Okay. All right, look, I'm goin' back home to a town called Apple Seed, it's on the Vermont border, but it's a lot closer to Nova Scotia than here. - Well, ain't that somethin'? You're goin' backward and I'm goin' forward and we're still headed in the same direction. - Look, what I'm offerin' is this. You pay $400. It's about all the gas, you pay for a couple of the hotels, 39.99 deals, share with the food and I will get you outta here today. - What routes are you intendin' to take? - I don't know, what does that matter? - Well, this here is a map to the blue-plate specials. It's a handful of points between here and there, where the old and the new shall meet and unveil the grandeur of the day. - All right, I got ya. You know what? I'm sorry my friend, this is the express train, but best of luck to ya. See ya. Okay. - My name is Carl Robbins. What's yours, son? - Well, it's not son. It's Prince McCoy. - They say destiny is like ladies of the evening. They don't make house calls, you just gotta go for it. So, how did someone from the picturesque town of Apple Seed find themselves way out here? - It's called life. Anyways, ya know Carl, I might be a little headachy for a bit, so I might not be the best talker. - Ah, sometimes it's good to just let the sun hit your face, the wind stroke your hair. - You doin' okay? - Yes. - What can I get you fellas? - I'm gonna have the cheeseburger, fries and a ginger ale, please. - Good, safe choice. And you, Sir? - This is just somethin'. - What's that? - Well, quite the array of bonne bouche you have here. - Bonne bouche? Well, if I didn't have the benefit of a good education I might think you just insulted me. - The pictures of your food here on the menu, it looks good enough to eat right off the page. Okay. - Thank you. Now, what would you like? - Well, dear Jolene, I would like to try the same cheeseburger my young companion here is partaking in, but I would prefer the chocolate shake. And with that, I would like your fruit salad and a side of frog sticks. - Frog sticks? - French fries. - Some eggs on toast, a serving of your honey buttermilk biscuits and a glass of dog soup. It's water. - Impressive. All right. Well, I'll have it up in a little while. - Yes, Ma'am. This tastes better than it even looks. And Miss Jolene, this cake looks like the best piece of dessert that I ever rolled my orbs across. Yeah! - Carl, I should be tipping you. Do you have any idea how long I've been makin' my family's chocolate cake? How many times I've cracked those eggs and greased that pan and spread that frosting? Well, I don't have any idea either. All I know is, - What's that? - I spend my days staring at this black beauty, trapped inside this glass display case goin' unnoticed and untouched, from morning 'til night while the rest of the world passes it by. But I'll be darned if I don't head on back into that kitchen every couple of days and fire up that oven and preheat it to 325. - Ya know, I'm gonna go hit the head. You might wanna, too. I think you might have to. - Ladies and gentlemen! I would be doing myself and this lonely piece of pastry an enormous disservice if I did not make available to you a free slice of this delicious cake. Just hold up your hands, please. There's one right back there. Oh, yes. Oh, and here's another. Oh, that is fantastic. Be sure to tell all of your friends, because something this wonderful should not be overlooked. Nothin' like a little piece of cake to save the day. Woo hoo! Yoo hoo! Some things you can't think about too much, Son. You just gotta do. - Hey, you wanna get us arrested? You gotta put those on. - I'm not advocating unlawful conduct, but it's really great to see another blue-plate special come through! All right, listen, listen. The blue-plate thing, the blue-plate special thing, stop it! Enough. Can we just do things with clothes on instead, all right? Come watch some TV or somethin'. - Woo hoo! Good morning. Gonna be pretty hot today, I think. - I'm not interested. - In the weather? - In whatever you want from me. - Just a little yip yap. Which way you headed? - Just headed. - Well, nice places there I hear. You travelin' with your family? - Just some friends. - Oh. - Oh, I gotta go. Are you a crazy person? - Well, we'll have to wait until I can compare. - Compare to what? - Sane people. - I saw you naked. - My apologies. - I'm Rocky. I'll see ya. - I think so. I can't speak for all Oklahoma women, but the ones I knew were really nice girls. - All right, that's good to know. - And I'm not talkin' nice girls, you know? - I know what you're talkin' about. - Well. You know, sometimes they haul their cattle in from somewhere, unload 'em here. - A lotta wood there. - Oh yeah, yeah. You know, these are old railroad ties. - Is that right? - Oh, yeah, yeah. These are all railroad ties. They make great corrals. - They make great urinals, too. - "Regan, I don't know when you're gonna find this. Maybe weeks, maybe years from now. By then you'll have heard about this crazy thing. He seemed like such a normal guy. This stupid thing that I did back home. And I don't expect it to make much sense, but sometimes you just need to make yourself heard. But I got two things in my life that I regret doing. One I'm about to do and two, is every second I had the opportunity to look in your eyes and I didn't." - Evenin', Miss Sawyer. - Hello. - My name is Carl Robbins, and you're even lovelier than your photo. - Oh, I mean, my photo? - Well, yeah, it's the one that my young companion carries around with him all the time and he accidentally dropped it and he's very fond of it. - Where... Where... - May I use your restroom? - Yeah, of course. Where is he? - Well, he's ducked down right over there. Kinda hunkered down. - Hi. Hi, Regan. - This is really quite somethin'. Painted a few things myself over the years. But my shrinking violet expressionism lacks your candor. Though, my wife taught me to always look closer than what you see on the surface. - Your wife? Is she, she an artist? - She's no longer walking with us. But she left miles and miles of footprints behind. - I'm... We're sorry to barge in on you like this and I know it's late. We should probably get... - No, you boys are staying here. I got room. - Yeah, but we don't wanna upset any roommates or push anybody out. - I live alone at the moment. - Well, being cash strapped as we are, I don't know that it would hurt to stay. - Cash strapped? Are you guys okay with money? - Well, I have a fella here that can explain it. - Yeah, we're fine with money, Carl. We're okay. - Well, we were until I walked out of our last pit stop one wallet short. - You lost your wallet? Your money's gone? - Well it departed during my presence. And my end of the bargain is providing the money. - Yeah, you know what? Your, bargains, bargains. We're okay, we're all good. We have money, Carl. We have plenty of money, we're okay, and as a matter of fact, I think this is a beautiful place that we're in right now. This is beautiful. If you don't mind 'cause this is just so beautiful, we need a little recuperation and some fresh air and we're gonna stay here. - I think that's a good idea. - Great idea. - So, I'm going back home too, in a few days. - Oh yeah? You're gonna see your folks, huh? I think about 'em all the time. - I'm getting married. - Whoa. Wow, that's somethin' big. - It's something I've wanted for forever. - Well, congratulations. I mean, you've talked about that for a long time. - Yeah. Still. I remember hearing you yell out one time, you wished the whole place would wash away in a biblical flood or something. - Just drunk and pissed. Everything gets all biblical when you're drunk. - I'm marrying Justin. - Oh, hell. Stayed together, huh? - Yeah, still together. We're getting married at the church in the town square. - Our little square. - Well, it's the town square. - Yeah. Well, we got a lotta ice creams there. - Right. Well, the couch is set up for you. You need some rest, it'll make you feel better. I'll see you in the morning. - 'Kay. - I, um... It really is nice to see your face again. I don't like forgetting what it looks like. - Might've been nice if we'd woken Regan up and said goodbye. - I'm not too big on goodbyes, so. Carl, you're gonna have some money, right? - I'll keep my end of the bargain. - All right. - We could topple over, straight down an abyss, that no amount of bare fingered rock climbing could ever pull your pained body back up. And so, as you go through life from A to Z, and you make what amounts to the tiniest, tiniest change in direction, it can, over time and distance, take you to a whole new destination. And with that folks, I thank you for listening, I thank you for coming. - Thank you. - Thank you. - My pleasure. You're a wonderful group. Thank you, Sir. Thank you. Thank you, Ma'am. - Yes, thank you. - Thank you so much. - Nice to see you. - Thank you, Ma'am. - Thank you. - Thank you. - That was a very good speech that he gave, and I'm glad I saw it. And he was wonderful. Okay. See ya. - See ya. - Have a nice day. - I will do that. - What are you doin'? - Spreading the Gospel. - The Gospel? - Gospel. The world is our church, Son. Every corner, every street, congregation. - All right, but the next time the good Lord goes whispering into your ear, talk to me first. - I'm not speakin' for the Lord, Son. I'm raisin' a lone voice for Sarah. - Sarah? - My wife. We had a lot of ideas, she and I. Silly ones. Not just the ones that form in your head, but those that grow in your heart. You know those? And those are the good ones. And if for one reason or another, you don't get to fulfill those promises, then just go out and do it yourself. I promise you, you can take the love with you. I have somethin' to say to the world. It might not be a gold mine, but at least it's a gold coin. Here. A few miles at a time, Son. Do you want me to drive, Son? - You can't drive, Carl. - Okay. It kinda looks fun. Rocky, Rocky seems to be having a little problem. - You know that girl? Nah, nah. None of our business. - Life ain't always about business, Son. - Listen, Dudley Do-Right, we got a journey to attend to. - She's got my money. - What? - Back at the motel, I believe. - Hey, girl, give me the money. - What? - The wallet you took out of our hotel yesterday, I want it back and the money all better be there. - Not now, dude. My ride's altruism just turned into horny-ism. I'm not happy about it. - Yeah, well, I'm sorry for ya but I want the wallet. - Look, I'll give you somethin', all right? Back off. - Look, you can either give it to me or I can take it from you. It's your choice. - Screw you. - I can't believe you just did that! - I warned you, buddy. - You just kicked me in the crotch. - I warned you. - Stop saying you warned me. - The old man was nice to me. I borrowed three bucks for a couple sodas. - Got it, let's go. - She's all alone out here, Son. - We're all alone out here, Carl. She deserves where she's goin'. - Well, she ain't got where she's goin' yet so we can't say she deserves it. She's just a child. - Anyway, 29 times. I counted. He hit me 29 times. Now mind you, I deserved a few of 'em. I'm not too proud or progressive to not admit that. They weren't full to the face, but they stung, you know? So, one night, I thought to myself, stepdad or no, he ain't gettin' to 30. - How old are you? - 16 going on 25. - Oh, great. It's gonna be 25 to life. Look, the next town we come to, we're droppin' you off and you're callin' your mom. - Drop me off anywhere, I'm not calling her. My mom is more lost than I am out here. Anyway, I have cousins in Canada. - Well, I'm happy for you. - What about you, Carl? - Off to a few special places. - Girlfriend? - There is one woman I haven't seen for 40 years, sown into the fabric of my heart. - That's crazy, man. My parents were like one and two years old the last time you saw her. That's like two lifetimes. - Yeah, or one very long one. - Hey, you, would you stay in here and like, watch TV? Let's get outta here. - CCR rules! - He's right. CCR does rule. It's good stuff. Let me ask you somethin'. Do you think we change the music or the music changes us? - That hippie stuff never really vibed with me. - You've crossed a few flower children in your day, huh? - My parents started off as hippies and they ended up old adults. - Wait, what's your name? My name's Dallas. - Prince. - Prince? Wow. It must be nice. - Well, they say it's good to be king, but they say nothing about being prince. But I hear Dallas is nice, though. - Unless your last name is Kennedy. I think I'm gonna call this next one, "Prince of the Hippies." Be sure to it on the next leg of my bus tour across the country. Just doesn't have my name on the side of the bus. Unless it's secretly Greyhound. - So, you wanna, I don't know, you wanna dance? - I hate to waste good music. Waste becomes a topic high on the list of contemplation as we get older. Waste of time bein' number one on that list. Is the dance off? - I just, I'm sorry, I didn't even know. - Of course you didn't. I left the my parents got in a car crash and all I have left is this lousy t-shirt at home. Nothin' odder than goin' to bed two good parents and two good walkin' legs and wakin' up without 'em. But trust me, I can still make really good use of an empty bar floor. - I'm sure you can. I really... I am so sorry. You have an amazing voice. An amazing voice. - Really? - Daddy's home. Gettin' a little late for that kinda music don't you think? Looks like someone's still enjoyin' the senior prom. - Yes, Sir. You ever hear one of those songs in your head, you know, when you just can't keep your feet from tappin'? - Oh yeah. Yeah, wow. That's groovy. You and "Born on the Fourth of July" are the most entertainment I've had all week. - You are so lucky I can't kick your ass. - Hey, pool man! Why don't you go back to your boy band there before somethin' happens. - You got some for me little man? I beat my own mother out of bed for breakfast in the morning, and I'll do the same to you. - Let's go. - Yeehaw! Woo hoo! Woo hoo hoo hoo. Woo hoo, woo hoo! - You might wanna get that checked out old man. Punk. - He stumbled out of here like 15 minutes ago if you're wondering. He smelled like a really old vodka factory. - Hey, what's up buddy? Tell me again, that whole story about how I'm gonna regret makin' fun of your dad and your tone deaf girlfriend. Wow. - Okay, okay. Especially the part about where the asshole came into the bar with his two boyfriends to play their pool game and they're playin'... - Yeah! - Tell him, Amir, you tell him. You tell him with your fists. - Pow! Am I right? I don't know, am I better at dancing or fighting? - Yeah! Oh! - Woo! - Kumite! - What are you like extra depressed, Jack Kerouac? Is that what you are? Maybe I should grind you into the pavement, hm? What do you think, Andy? Yeah? - Put him in a body bag! Yes! Oh yeah, you tell him Amir, you tell him. - Look at you. What, what? - Yeah, punch him in the moose knuckle! - Excuse me. - Huh? Hey! Ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow! - Frogs. Frogs. There's one. There's another one. - Hey, take it easy old man, chill, chill. Whoa! - Bull frogs! Big mean, green frogs everywhere. - Whatever, man. - Are they gone? - Frogs? - Are those gentlemen? - Yeah, they left. - Oh. That really gets the heart rate up. In the house, the number one rule in the scrap is to act outta sorts. Let 'em think that you're kind of on the crazy side. That's funny. - House? Were you in prison? - Well, Washington State Correctional Institute, San Quintin. - San Quentin Prison for what? - July 20th, 1973. Two men and myself walked into a bank in Kingston, Washington. Each of us with a pistol and a canvas bag. Only two of us walked out. Of course, it wasn't too far a walk. - You weren't really seeing frogs were you? - Frogs in the parking lot? That's crazy talk, Son. Oh yeah. - Oh, man. - Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon to you. When you feel this little breeze, the cool air comes across the plain. Thank you, Ma'am. - I am honored to be part of one of your blue-plate specials, Carl. - The honor is all mine, young Rocky. - So, what's her name? - Ruth. Ruth Lockerman. - Well, I knew you were married, man, Carl, but how well do you know this young lady? - I met her once a long time ago. - Wait a minute, once? I thought she was sewn into the fabric of your heart? - Ruth Lockerman was the teller at the bank I held up. - Cool second date. - Good morning. - Hi. How are you today? - I'm fine, thank you. How are you? - I'm not that swell about getting on my feet because of this. - Well you just, yeah. - Okay. - You just stay comfortable there. - All right. - Okay if I take this seat? - Sure. It was intended. - How are you today? - I feel fine today. - Yeah? You look wonderful. - I'm glad. - Good. - And were are we to meet here? - Yes, yes, yes. - Oh! Out here, okay. - Yeah. Well, Ruth it's great to meet you. - Thank you. - My name is Carl. - Oh, Carl. - Carl. - That's my father's name. How do you spell it? - C-A-R-L. - He does, too. - Yeah? - He did. - Oh, okay, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. I'm dying to know why you're walking around here. - Well, I'm sorry I didn't call in advance, - Yeah. - But there's a shortage of phone booths around here and I couldn't get to a booth to call you in here. - Oh, right. - Actually, my mission here is, well, I, in my younger days, uh, was a... - We all have younger days, don't we. - I was, uh, uh, a bad man. - A bad man? - A bad man. In fact, I was a bank robber and you were working for a bank, Washington State over on Pettit Street. We came and robbed the bank and... - I can't believe this, Carl. - And you were teller and I have remembered you throughout the years. - What a poetic thing to say. - Well, it is kind of poetic but it's what I feel. - You know, the funny, the odd part about it is that I know it was a big deal. - Yeah. - And I can't remember it. - Yeah. - And that's part of the price I pay I guess, for living a long time for one thing. - Yeah, yeah. - But, yeah. But it happened long ago. - Well, it was over 40 years ago. - And so you allow yourself to be known as a bank robber? - Well, yes. Now I... I wonder... - A wonderful story, and thanks for tellin' me. - It's true, it's a true story. Yeah. What I want to do is I want to feel that I have righted a wrong, that I have somehow, that I can feel, kinda feel good about, about myself, again. - And you haven't forgiven yourself yet? - No, I haven't. I haven't. - I'm really glad to see you do this and know that you're letting go of something that may have been making your life heavy or hard. And that we can, you can start, you could be yourself. I wish I could give you what you want about how you feel. All I can remember now, is now. - Thank you. That really helps. - Does it? I think it's fine. I'm fine and you're fine. - I'm glad you're fine. - How 'bout forgettin' it this time? - Okay. - Lettin' it go. - Okay. - It's not quite Broadway but it does have a humble hometown feel to it. - Yeah. That was for that kind of thing. - We all got our kinda thing, don't we Prince? I hope you find yours soon. - All right. Well. - You know, it's disrespectful to shake while standing up. - Right. Well, this is a interesting place. - So, this old friend of yours... - Sirom Newton. - When was the last time you saw him? - Oh, about 40 years ago I'd say. I stole $12,000 from him and left him alongside the road bleedin' to die. - Hello there. - Sirom, it's me, Carl Robbins. - Carl Mad Dog Robbins. Hey man. Carl Mad Dog Robbins. So good to see you. - Oh, I don't go by that much anymore. - Look at you. Long, long time ago. When'd you get out? - Four days ago. - Four days? - Four days. - Really? You've been walkin' around a free man for only four days? - That's right. - Really? You escape? Wow. - Oh, this is Raquel, Rocky. - Yo. - Hey. - Prince, how you doin'? - Hi, welcome. And you, I have so many, so many questions for you, you old bad influence. But we can get caught up on all those good times later, right? - We will. - All right. Why don't you come on back. Everyone's winding down from the gestalt awareness practice. - Gestalt a-what? - Yeah. Gestalt a-what? Come on back and meet everyone. Nice to see you. Can I introduce you to Rocky? - Yeah. - Hello. - How you doin'? - Hi. - Yeah. Okay, all right everyone. Time for the Kool-Aid, my friends. Just kidding of course. We're beer folk here, anyway. Before we start, I'd like to take the time to thank a very dear friend of mine and a couple of new ones for takin' the time to haul their butts all the way out here just to see me. Thank you and welcome to our little awareness group. So, for the benefit of our visiting vagabonds, what we do here is pretty simple. We just clear away the nonessential blocks to who we really are, and the only catch is you gotta do it like right now. Ready, set, go. Be aware. Be enlightened. So, anyone wanna throw their hat into the ring and tell us a little something about themselves? As long as it's it's not boring of course. Hello, Prince. - Hi, I'm just listenin' today. - Well listening, that's 68% of the battle right there. You sure you got nothin' interesting or maybe a little lame to tell us? - I'll try some of this gestalt stuff. - Well, why don't you go right ahead my friend. - My name is Carl Robbins, somewhere south of 80 years old. Not worth braggin' about. Those were not favorable years. But I did one smart thing in that time. I married my wife and had my son. Yeah, that's about as good as it gets. Once upon a time, I told a young man that he owed the world nothing, that I taught him that taking was more rewarding than giving. And that was no lesson for me to be preaching. Maybe neither of us were deserving of much loyalty at that time. But even among the fallible, one's own deception is still deception. - Well, I guess all those years weren't wasted after all. I mean, some of us spend an entire lifetime searching for that kinda clarity. And I imagine you did a lotta pushups. - Yep. I sold you a lot of codswallop and then just left you alone. - I swallowed that codswallop with a beer chaser and I woulda done the same to you, man. I was young. I'd burn the city down just to keep my feet warm. I've knocked people to their knees just so that I could feel a little bit taller. So Carl, if you weren't sellin', I would've found somebody who was. - You know Sirom, we need to feel we paid the price. - I could throw you over. How's that work? - Be my guest. - Oh, yeah. - Is he still alive? - I'm not sure. - What the hell is this thing? - It looks, you live here. You're supposed to know. New, exciting, colorful and a vintage, I don't wanna call it boring, but I'm gonna, black and white print. Do you think the is like, this art is meant to be like an oxymoron or something? - Yeah, but I think this would look much... - This cake doesn't look exciting either. Like, this cake looks like it wouldn't taste great. It looks like, old. - Yeah, no it does. I can't really look at the picture though, I'm sorry. - Shh! Well, cowboy? - You think you're staying here don't you? Look, Rocky, you can't stay here. You're just, you know. - A kid? Yeah, I know. That's why I called my mom this morning. She flies in tonight. Wait, you were trying to throw me out at the nearest rock quarry the other day. - Sorry. I just... - Hey, it's okay. You're off the hook. Listen, I... I couldn't sleep last night. And I've had plenty of nights where I couldn't sleep, because I hated my stepdad or was scared of my life. But I don't know like, last night I couldn't sleep because I was completely excited about being alive. And Billy's very cute. So, thanks I guess. - Well, I guess take care then. - Take care then? You're not gonna give me a hug? What's wrong with you? Gimme a hug. Come on. Ugh, weirdo! Be good, Prince. You were given the right name. Live up to it. - Sage versus the Devil. Oh! It dwarfs every wonder the silver screen has ever known. - Well, you certainly know how to sell a motion picture show. - And you certainly know how to make one memorable. - Yeah. - Yeah. Carl, I know you came here looking for somethin', somethin' from me to help heal up an old wound that I just wasn't able to mend. What you need my friend, it lies elsewhere. - I had an old 1938 half ton, no, ton and a half Ford truck. And I was tryin' to make enough money with it, so I could get into college. - Please not right now, not right now. Come on, come on, baby, please. Please, please, please, please. Damn it! Damn it! - What's the matter? What's the matter? - The camshaft and the valves. It's like three grand to fix. - We can raise some money, we can do that. - Oh, we're not gonna raise three grand. Your preachin's not gonna get that kinda money, all right? It's done. It's just done. - Be here soon. - You know, Carl, you can get like a month in jail for doin' somethin' like this. - Where I come from, they call it recess. - Well, I don't got time for a month in jail. I got things waitin' for me back home. - Well, if they're waitin' for you back home, they're wastin' their time. - Oh, is that right? Well, home may not know it's waitin' for me, but it is. Besides that why can't we like hitchhike or somethin'? Why do we gotta take a train? Oh, you and that old map. Look, your wife may be crazy enough to do this joyride with you, but I'm not. - When you travel with chickens, you cluck. When you travel with eagles, you soar. Look at that corn. Look at that. Look at that! - Does it? - Yeah, it looks just like a gator but it's... - Like that? - Yeah, he's got a long snout. It doesn't have legs. It has, it has... - Like a hog? - It has scales, but it looks just like a gator. - That's the weirdest thing. Are you makin' that up? - No, it's true. - I don't believe you. - Yeah, if you don't believe it, get on your computer and check gar, G-A-R. - I won't pull out my computer. - Now, you just dip it real thoroughly. Gotta be soaked real good. And finally, we just walk these little darlin's over to the fire, and you just cook the outside. You cook it and what it does is is steams the sweet corn on the inside, just like one of the best restaurants in good old Paris. - After everything you've been through why do you find everything so damn enjoyable? - Yeah. Cooked corn by the river. Need I say more? - The car was all I had left. - Hey, you got me. - Yeah. I guess so. This thing's gettin' pretty raging. - Yeah, yeah. Watch your flies don't get hot. You ever had that happen? Your fly, your buttons? - I have. - Hey, how much further 'til our next stop? - Not much further. We're almost there, I think. - You think maybe we can get some money out of this guy? Like, rent a car? - Maybe. - What's his name? - Hughie. - Hughie? - Hughie. - You didn't leave this guy like bleeding in the street did ya? - Not quite. - All right. Let's go. No. His car's here so he's probably around somewhere. - Would you mind check and see if he's home? I just need a minute. - All right. Excuse me. - Oh, hey, great. Would you mind doin' me a favor? There's needle nose pliers in my tackle box, and I've got a little situation here I think I can loosen. Yeah, there they are. Boy, I'm really good at lettin' stuff... Here. I think I can fix it. Thank you very much. I am really, really good at holdin' onto stuff way too long. Ya know, I bought this at a PX in Okinawa when Ronald Reagan was president. I won a $500 jackpot with it, and I had this thing for decades. I was fishing with my wife. We were fishin' for Muskie and I caught a big one and she screamed and I looked back. I had the rod in one hand and the reel in the other, and her scream started to turn into laughter. And I got mad and I vowed to fix it. Took me about a week then I fixed it, and now it looks like that I can stick a fork in it 'cause it's done. Hey, what's your name again? - Prince. - Oh! I'm sorry, hold on, hold on, hold on. I got a little spasm. Hang on, hang on. I'll be okay, I'll be okay. I did, ah. Oh, boy. Do you feel old yet? - Uh... - Ah nah, you're not old so, 'cause when you get old it feels like the last decade just beat the crap outta ya. You know the problem with old, is it sneaks up on ya and starts suckin' on your bones when you're young and you don't care. So, what'd you come by here for, to listen to my whine? - I actually came on behalf of a friend of yours and hopefully a good one. - Really? Hm. - Hello, Hughie. Nice to see you, Son. - You clearly came here for somethin'. Deal with it quick. - May I enter? - Yeah, whatever. - Nice house. - Thanks. You need some water or somethin'? - Please. - Don't have any ice. - Water is fine. Thanks. Much fish today? - Nope. Only got zebra mussels. Comin' on boat hauls and take over. Just crowd everything else out. - It doesn't sound too good. - It's not. - Glad to see you know so much about fishin', boy. Georgia. - Georgia's been gone for three and a half years. Georgia's been gone a long time. - That never gets easy. She sounded like a real nice woman. - Oh, so you know a lot about my wife, huh? - Well, I got some letters from old Kenny Stewart from time to time. Yeah. Georgia Christine Robbins. Child of the State of Delaware, graduate of Columbia. - Kenny's an ass. He's been stickin' his nose up other people's business a long time. - Well, yeah. His favorite view was always out the window, that's for sure. - Yeah, right. - Good to sit a bit. Yeah, it sure is good to sit for a bit. Your mother loved the water. That's why she made me move to Washington when you were just a little fella. - You know my wife, oh the one that you're an expert of because of the prison letters. You know, we had a hell of a lifetime together. It was short, but it was real and it was real love. - I know how fast a lifetime can pass. And I'm glad that you felt that love and that relationship. - I haven't seen a photograph of you in a decade, but I'll never forget the face. But my memory is distorted because you see, I was lookin' at you through a scratched up spit stained piece of plexiglass, and it made your face look funny. - Some things have changed, Hughie. - Yeah? Well, you know what didn't change, was that mom got old and died without you. See, now I saw that and I said, "No, I'm not gonna let that happen. "I'm not gonna get old without love." I thought, I was gonna grab your face and look you in the eye and tell you how much I missed ya, and that we could laugh together and joke around. But that's not gonna happen. And you know that .22 that you gave me right before you went to prison? Well, I kept it and then I decided to sell it. Pop, there's your money. - Well, here we are. - Here we are. You got far to go? - No, maybe like 10 miles. - Meadows Lane. - Yeah, you remembered? - Yeah. - Yeah, I got an old cabin up behind my parent's house up there. I don't think anybody, anybody goes there so I might stay there. Why Nova Scotia? - Hm. I just always liked the sound of it. Whatever you hope to find back there or whatever you hope to make right, just remember, the past is only good for reminding ya, you still got a future. Take care of yourself. - When I'm back it kinda just all feels emptier. I guess you can never really come home after you leave. - Where's Carl? You both took off on me. - He had to go to Nova Scotia. He said it sounded nice. - Been flowing through here since we were kids, and it just keeps goin'. I drove through Temple Hill Tunnel this morning. How many times did you try and climb up and paint our names on there? - A few. - Like, half a dozen times. Then the police showed up - Dear God. - and totally caught you. - Yeah. Oh, that's right. But you remember you hid in the bushes when I went and did that. - My parents woulda killed me. - Yeah, you were like 25 years old. - I'm a daddy's girl. - That's right, you are. - You still tried that one last time, right before I moved away. What were you gonna paint, again? - Prince loves Regan. - So why'd it seem easier then? - Smaller bodies and bigger ideas. - One day I, I took in a deep breath, and I inhaled everything I love about us. And I held it in my lungs for a moment, as hard as I could and I, I finally exhaled. Sometimes our soul mates are not meant for the end of our lives, but rather somewhere in the middle. - I'm lettin' you know somethin'. The past is only good, damn it. Okay, oh my God. Where am I? Where's my... Excuse me, this is a robbery. Oh, it's a robbery. No, I don't know what I'm doing. We're good. Carl, we're good. I don't, you're a good guy, Carl. I wanted to be a good guy like you. You got nice shoes. When I met you, you kept tellin' me these great words and I keep forgetting these great words you kept sayin' to me. You always have good words, and I don't listen to them. I don't listen to them. I'm trying to listen. You had some really great words for me. You got nice shoes. You got nice shoes. - Come on, Son. We got ourselves a dragon to slay. - Carl? You know, there this bank in my old hometown. I had my first savings account in that bank. $16. It gave me lollipops. - What does every dragon need? A knight to slay it. - Thank you, Wade. Oh now remember, next week is free gifts on Friday. - That's redundant. - What's that? - Free gift. - Oh. - A gift is free. Just sayin'. - Yeah, you're right. I am usually so good at that, too, really. Like close proximity. That's redundant. Okay. Okay, bye, Wade. Good morning, Sir. - Morning to you, Miss. Firstly, that is a lovely blouse you have on. - Well, thank you very much. That is very sweet of you to say. - And thirdly, secondly, I take it this is the one and only Apple Seed National Bank & Trust? - Well yes, Sir. Founded in 1929. It was actually the first bank erected in Apple Seed during the mining years. Prior to that, it was the Apple Seed Train Station built in 1872. Much of the memorabilia on display right along the wall there. - Well, you have a wonderful memory for details. - Oh, thank you. That was just because I practice. - Practice details? - No, no. Practice my memory. See, I'm also actually an actress. So, I practice retaining information so it helps me memorize my lines. I'd love to do some local theater, but I get a little nervous in front of an audience still. - Well, I'd say you're an actress with or without an audience, just remember that. - Oh my God, that is so sweet. Thank you very much. That just made me really happy. Thank you. - Well, along that note, my third point is it's something I'm not going to enjoy saying and you're not gonna enjoy hearing, I would assume, but I promise you, this is going to be one heck of an acting exercise. - Um... - What is your name, Miss? - Ruby. Ruby Sugar Stewart. - Ruby Sugar. I didn't know they were handing out names that nice anymore. Well, Ruby, I can promise you that this moment, as traumatic as it may seem, has the potential to transform itself into something wonderful. - Okay. - Trust me. Well yes, Sir. I do understand that this is a mighty big felony, but I can promise that no one in here has been injured or hurt in any way. Well, let me help assure you. Has anyone in here been hurt or injured in any way other than just this inconvenience? Well, they're all shaking their head no, Sir. Negative. Now, Sir, I appear to have some company here, so I will have to call you back. Thank you very much. Hello, Son. - Carl, what the hell are you doin'? - Well, apparently causing a hell of a ruckus. - Hey, is everybody all right, everybody okay? - I'm not hurt. Nobody is hurt. Everything's actually fine and Carl has been very nice, in fact he even let me press the secret alarm and I always wanted to do that. - Okay. Listen, Carl... Yeah, you don't have to raise your hand, it's okay. - Oh, sorry. I was just wondering how long this is going to take 'cause Mr. Rykard here has a doctor's appointment at 11:15. - Mr. Rykard, you will make your appointment. Ruby, do you by any chance have a glass of water? Anyone else? Anyone wants some water? Glass of water? Anyone? One, two, three. Four, please. Oh, wait? Son, do you want a glass of water? - I don't want any water. - Yeah, what, can you just tell me what's going on right now? I was like a little in my head 'cause I'm not sure. - Just four. Ruby is very nice. She wants to be a motion picture actress. - All right Carl, listen. We gotta let 'em know no one's hurt. All right? So, we just start lettin' people out one by one, let 'em see everybody's okay. - We can't do that, Son, not yet. Now, first they're gonna assess my mental state. And then they're gonna try to talk me into releasing the hostages. And by that time we'll be fine. Ruby, would you mind telling the officers that no one in here has been injured or harmed in any way? And please, I hope I'm not being too terrifying. Oh, oh, Ruby? Yes, yes. There's a good audience out there, and you might just make the papers. - Hello. Thank you. My name is Ruby with a B, Sugar Stewart. - Woo hoo! - Thank you. Thank you. - Woo! - I just want everyone to know that everything is okay. Carl is real nice. I mean like, really nice. He's the best. Thank you. Hey Joe. Thank you. - Carl. Just give me the gun, you know? I'm gonna tell 'em you had a long trip and that your head just isn't... - That's right, Son. You just go out there and tell 'em. Open up your mouth and let it all out. - This isn't good. This isn't fine. I wasn't gonna rob this place. All right, maybe I was but, it's 'cause I was alone and I was sad and afraid and you do dumb things when you're sad and alone. So, just give me the gun. - Lollipops. My wife loved lollipops. I am pretty impressed with you. - Impressed in what way? - You could just have moved on. - Move on? Carl, you're robbin' a bank. - That's very true, Son. It was a bad road to take, and I shouldn't be robbin' this place, but here I am. - So I wouldn't. - Look out there. What do you see? - I see a bunch of freaked out people, man. - Kinda scary, huh? - Yeah, it is to be honest. - Well, that's a good thing. You stop bein' scared, it's time to start panicking. - Okay, Carl. Give me the gun. - Take another look. - Carl, the gun. - Take a look out there, boy! Now what's lookin' back at you? - Faces. Scared, angry, confused faces. - Think about it too much, it can be a very daunting sight. All those faces, all that expectation, those debts left unpaid, those loves left behind. Come here. If you look close enough through all that chaos and confusion, you can always see something bright, something new. Life is full of little plums. Some you get to keep, some you gotta throw back. But you really can't put a damper on a life that gives you plums. Good choices come from experience, but experience sometimes comes from bad choices. A bad choice ain't worth a damn if you can't make a good one from it. - Carl? That was really nice, Carl. - Thanks, Ruby. - Mr. McCoy? - Yes? - I'm Megan. I'm taking care of Carl. He's ready for visitors at this moment, but I should let you know that his heart failure has gotten worse, which means that his heart is getting weaker, and every time his heart beats, less blood is coming out than it should. - Hello, Prince. - How are you? - A bit tired. Been a heck of a week. - Yeah. How you doin'? - I think I'm fine, just fine. How 'bout you? - All right. No. No, I'm not all right. Carl, what were you thinking? You just got outta prison for crying out loud. You got your whole life ahead of you. - I'm gonna live to 160? - Yeah, maybe. You don't know. I don't know. That's that's what life is, okay? We don't know, man. You know, I thought I had a lot of things figured out. Kinda thought the world made a lotta sense. I don't like all the sense that it made, but I figured I had it down. One plus one equals two and all that. Then I met a man who took my math book and kinda threw it out the window, stole the heart of a thief. Set someone free by makin' him a hostage? I danced with a woman that had no legs. And there was a time where I would've thought that didn't make a lotta sense. Now just, it all just kinda seems like life. - You know what I never thought was possible? That I'd ever live long enough to see a road I once didn't take. - You saw that road? - Yeah, Prince. I did. - You know, you could call me son. - Son. - I'd like to stop at this little filling station and buy each one of these boys a Dr. Pepper. I don't know, Dr. Pepper seems like a good drink. I mean, it gave you energy. And yeah, yeah, it did. - Yeah, I bet it did. - All right. I think they were makin' Dr. Pepper back then with somethin' else besides sugar, you know? - No, I don't know. Is that the fact? - Well somethin', somethin', they were makin' it with somethin'. It was a little... - Well, ya know, I heard that Coca-Cola was doing that. - Oh, Coca-Cola, okay. - I'm not sure, but I think Coca-Cola might've been puttin' something in it that gave you a little extra zip. - A little extra zip. - Anyway, we stopped at this station, yeah, to get some Dr. Pepper, and we were there outside, it was the kind that had the machine, and this girl that I had known in high school, she came wheelin' up with a little baby carriage. And now, I didn't know that she was even married or you know? - Oh boy. - But you know? - Hate when that happens.
