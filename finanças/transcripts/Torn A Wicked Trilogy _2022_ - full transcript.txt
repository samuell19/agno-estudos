When the thorn stake cuts a halfling, their blood bubbles. If the prince or princess were to procreate with a halfling the child resulting from such a union would undo the original spells creating the doorways. Holy shit, it’s like the apocalypse baby. Our job, the Elites, is not just to hunt down the ancients. We’re also given the duty of hunting down the halflings. As in killing them. Why didn’t you tell me? I didn’t think it would ever come to this. Well, it did come to this. Like, right now. We had no idea there was a second gate. We believed that there was no chance of any of the royal court coming through. - It was a non-issue. - Guess what, Tink. It’s not a non-issue. It’s a huge, Godzilla-sized issue. I can see that now. I never meant to lie to you. If you don’t mean to lie to someone, you simply don’t lie to them. I knooooooooow... Did you know what I was when you first saw me? Yes, but I didn’t know until you got near and I sensed the weak fae blood in you. I should’ve told you, Ivy-divy... but I was afraid you’d do something rash! What could I have done? You could’ve, I don’t know, hurt yourself. I wouldn’t hurt myself, Tink. But you would try to leave. You’re thinking about it now. You’re forgetting two very important things. Come to think of it, you’re forgetting a lot, because you got your head knocked. You have to consent. Sex. Consent to sex with the prince. As a halfling, that’s the only way a child can be conceived. No glamour. No magic or compulsion. - You have to actually... - I know what consent means. He can’t make you do it. Well, he could, and that’s just wrong, but a child won’t be conceived. Great, so he could force himself on me but hey, at least there’s no apocalypse baby. That’s not what I meant. But there’s a bigger problem, Ivy. Worse than me being a... Halfling? You said the prince tasted your blood, right? Yeah. Then there is nowhere you can go that he cannot find you. Come again? He’ll be able to sense you. It doesn’t matter if you went to Zimbabwe. I’m not even sure where Zimbabwe is, but I just like saying Zimbabwe, but he’d find you. When an ancient takes a part of someone into them, he is forever connected to that person. Do you know how to kill him? You cut off his head. But that’s not the most important thing... You cannot let anyone know what you are. What’s stopping the fae from outing me? Well, the prince won’t want to risk that. He won’t want to risk the time it would take to find another female halfling. I guess that’s one good thing. You can’t even tell Ren... I know he’s an Elite, and while I think that is as lame of a name as the Order, I have heard of them. How have you heard of them? I’m omnipresent. I think you mean omniscient, and... You’re... you’re not omniscient are you? No. I need to be able to trust you, and I’m not sure I do right now. I deserve that. Many fae have fallen to the Elite before the gateways were closed. Though I don’t think Ren is smart or cool enough for that level of badassery. Ren is a total badass. Whatever... You cannot tell him. It is his duty to end you. You have to pull it together, Ivy. I think I’m owed a pity party for the next couple minutes. You need to let Ren go. - Break up with him. - No. - Ivy... - No. End of discussion. Fine. I need to shower. Thank Queen Mab. I know you probably want to slice and dice me, Ivy. I’m sorry. No, but I kind of want to flush you down the toilet. I’m not a goldfish. You might not believe this, but I didn’t stay with you because of what you are... I stayed because I care about you. I also stayed because you have the magical and wonderful Amazon Prime. I need a snack. Really? Ren. Hey. You okay? Yeah. You have sugar and crumbs all over you. I was, um, hungry and tired. Did that ass save you any of the Beignets? One. Mm. Looks like your chest ate most of it. Thanks. What time is it? A little after two. The streets were dead. There was no sign of the prince or the warrior knights. I don’t understand why they’d be laying low like this. They’re probably focused on finding the halfling. Did I hurt you? No. Did you see David tonight? Only for a bit. He said he’s trying to pull in more members in from Georgia. He asked about you. Really? Wants to know if you’re still planning to come in. I told him I thought you could use a few more days. Yeah, I don’t-I don’t know if I’ll be... ready. Well, I don’t want you on the street until you’re at a hundred percent. You sure you’re okay? Yeah, just tired. I like you watching me. Why are you clutching the blanket like it’s going to run away from you? Oh... I don’t know. You’re weird tonight. No, I’m not. You moving like that is going to drive me crazy. Well, we could, you know, do something about it. Ivy, we’ve got to take things easy for a little while. Babe, I want nothing more than to get between those legs, but I’m not going to risk hurting you. Did David say anything about Val? Order members are out looking for her. David isn’t too keen on the fact she’s probably shared a shitload of secrets. And I still want to kill her. David’s not questioning the whole halfling shit anymore either. You think Val is the halfling? Yeah. It’s what I’ve been thinking for some time. Maybe a fae got to her and found out. Her parents are denying it. I mean, who would fess up to that? Where are her parents now? Don’t know. Don’t really care. What about that crystal she took? David doesn’t know what it is, or he’s not saying. I put some feelers out to see if anyone in the Elite has an idea. Goodnight. Goodnight. Val! No! Ivy. Why? I wish it hadn’t been you that chased after me. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. I guess I can reregister for classes in the spring. Yeah, thanks for letting me know. Bye. Oh, so pretty. In the cart! I can’t believe I have to drop out. - Jo Ann’s gonna kill me. - It’s for the best. If the prince can sense me, why hasn’t he showed up here yet? If I were the prince, I’d be buying time. Buying time for what? He’s got to win you over... if he wants to impregnate you. Please don’t use the word impregnate ever again. Why? That’s what he wants to do. He’s probably trying to learn how not to be a sexed-up dickhead. I saw the prince getting it on with three females once. He’s totes sexed up and he’s a dickhead. In other words, no humanity. Like most fae. Yeah, but the agents are worse. He’s going to have to work on wooing you. Or he’s plotting something major and any moment he’s going to knock down the door and storm the place. Wow. That’s a relaxing thought. Don’t worry. I’m here to protect you. Oh. Mm... Mm... hmm... Mm... Hey. I didn’t want to wake you. But you were making these sounds. I was? These soft, little, breathy moans. I was? I wouldn’t lie about something that was so sexy. Mm. I want to kiss you. You don’t need my permission. Just assume it’s always granted. But your lip. My lips are fine. Actually, they’re not. They feel lonely and abandoned. God damn. You’re so sweet. I want to touch you. That’s another thing you don’t need permission for. Christ. I can’t even... I can’t either. I’ll be right back. Okay. Hmm. Hey, sweetness. You’re okay? Did I... I’m okay. Promise. - How’s your ribs? - Fine. They barely ached all day. I just realized I didn’t even make it to these. You can make up for it next time. Oh, I will. I’m going to shower them with so much attention, I might have to take them out to dinner. So I was thinking... - That’s what I smell. - Oh, Jeez. You and Tink to have more in common than you want to admit. I might have to kick you out of bed for that. Oh, yeah, you can’t kick me out of my own bed. Sorry. What are... What were you thinking about? I was going to go out tomorrow. Not to work. Just get back out there. Sounds good. I got the evening shift again. I kind of just wanted to go out and do my own thing. And you have to do that alone? Yeah. It’s nothing personal. - I just... - I know, Ivy. You got to prove you’re still the badass that you are. No one has seen a fae in days. Has nothing to do with the fae. You need a damn babysitter because you want to get out there and find Belle. Think I don’t know you that well? You don’t. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Sorry. I know you need to find her, but whatever questions you might have, it’s... not going to change what happened. Look, I’m going to be honest with you. You were strong and you were brave. But you were seriously injured a few days ago. It was more than a few days ago. Does that really make a difference? Look, it’s late. Can you turn off the light so we can go to bed? You almost died, Ivy. So could you try to use some common sense and just say... I don’t need your permission. Will you just think about what I said? Okay? Ivy. Okay. You shouldn’t go out. Am I supposed to stay here forever? Yes. Amazon does same-day delivery now and you can use man-boy to get us beignets since it’s the only thing he’s good at. I’ll be careful, I promise. You shouldn’t do that. I know you want to, but that would be very unwise of you, Ivy. Your friend has been very helpful. Speaking of, Val... Happen to know where she is? Why don’t we talk? That’s not going to happen. I think it is. What exactly can you do? Refuse me? I can. I beg to differ. You see, we are surrounded by humans. So many of them. And I have an extraordinary appetite, a rather impressive appetite for so many things. First off, eww. And second, I don’t want to hear about your appetites. And you should know that I could kill these humans in less than five seconds, leading them to believe that this little... redheaded girl murdered all of these innocent people. Deny me this, and their blood will be on your hands, little bird. Stop. You must be really useful on a crowded bus. - Sit. - I prefer to stand. - Sit, little bird. - Don’t call me that. Sit. Or I will make sure his insides are on his outside. He’s about to jump! Oh my God! Oh my God. The mortal realm has changed. Last time I was here, horses carried people where they needed to go. It’s taken me a few days to... adjust. My world is dying, little bird. Nothing new is reborn. The only way I can save it is to permanently open the gates. You killed your own world. You’re not going to do the same to ours. What do you know of my world, little bird? What do you know at all? I know I want to stab you in the eyeball every time you call me little bird. - You do not like me. - No shit. Perhaps if we met under better circumstances. One where didn’t kill me within an inch of my life? I would have ended your life if I hadn’t realized what you are. Wow. But now that I know how important you are, you will open the gates for me. Yeah... no. Let me impregnate you and you shall want it for nothing. That is probably the most unappealing offer in the history of mankind. Mmm. I smell fear on you and yet you speak to me as if you have no concern for your own well-being. Did you just smell me? You can come with me now and make this easy, or... Or I can make it hard? Yeah, I know how this works. You can’t force me to be with you. You can make me do a lot of things, but not that... ever. Is this because you love your human male? - What? - Tell me. How much do you value his life? Don’t threaten him. Are you insane? There’s literally nothing you can do or say that would make... ♪ You can fight this all you want. But trust me, you will be consenting sooner than later. Hey, Dylan, why is the gift shop closed? Jerome came down with a cold. So what are you doing out here? Fae know our location now, since that traitor led the Prince here. David moved operations down into the secure area. Got it. Sorry about this shit with Val. I know you was close with her. Thanks. Haven’t used this place for a while. I haven’t needed to. I thought you going to think about what you said, Ivy. I did. Yet you’re here. Are you going to let me pass? What have you been up to? Nothing, really. Went to get beignets, but... What? The place was packed. Am I interrupting? You gonna get pissed if I say yes, Miles? You’re watching Val’s parents’ house? Yes. Have been for the last week. How are things going? Her parents are no longer a concern. What does that mean? You know what it means. Did they confess to anything? Not like either of them was gonna admit to fucking a fae. Doesn’t matter. They’re compromised and the sooner we find their daughter, the better. If we’re lucky, the traitor isn’t knocked up yet. You okay? Did you know they’d taken out her parents? Pretty sure everyone in the Order knew that was going to happen. Do we have irrefutable proof that Val was a halfling? - No. - What if we’re wrong? What if she’s just a traitor and the Order flat out murdered her parents? They were good people, dedicated their entire lives, to this place. I get why you feel you need to find Val. I don’t want you out there because if you do find her, it’s going to be too hard. I don’t mean you can’t handle yourself. It’s just... It’ll be rough on you, Ivy. I know. You don’t need to live with the kind of shit that’s going to be left behind. I can shoulder that for you. You’re too good. Yeah, I am pretty awesome. Oh... And so modest, too. I really am sorry for what she’s done. You going home? In a little bit. Just remember what I said. If you find her, call me. I’ll make sure she’s brought in alive. Are you coming over after you get off? Well, I was planning on it. Ivy... I’ll miss you. Hey, Brighton. Hey, can you come over? My mom’s gone. Yeah, I’ll be right over. I didn’t know who else to call. I don’t really trust the other Order members. What’s going on? Mom hasn’t been acting right since the gate opened. She hasn’t been sleeping. She started talking about these places where the fair folk lived. Well, was she talking about the Otherworld? No, she was talking about our world. She told me it’s no longer safe. That the Order couldn’t defeat the prince. Only the fae could. And that the Order already knew that. Should have followed her when she went outside. But I didn’t. And when I went out to check on her, she was just... gone. When I came back in, I... I saw these journals. So I started reading. Oh, my God. This can’t be. No, I know. That’s what I thought at first, too. But my Mom isn’t that crazy. There are good fae, fae who came into our world and decided not to feed on humans. They lived normal lifespans. They worked alongside Order members. This book was all the members of the Order during that time. Some are still alive but have moved away. But there is one who’s still around. Jerome. Holy... Do we know where these good fae are living? This one has maps of the city. Places marked where hunts have been carried out, locations of kills. Are there any more like that? None that I found. Oh, and Ivy... Before she left, she told me Ren would know what to do. Why are you wearing shorts and knee socks? Why not just wear pants? First off, these are sleep shorts, and secondly, the socks are fuzzy, which makes them better than pants. I’m going to love pulling them off you later with my teeth. We need to talk about something first. Aren’t we going to talk about how these are feeling abandoned and I’ve been planning all day to rectify that? Mmm... - Merle’s missing. - Mm-hmm. She left behind all these journals, some dating back decades. They detail how the Order used to work alongside the fae. Come again? Yeah, she talks about how there are actually good fae; fae that don’t feed on humans. Are you high? I wish. But if you let go of me I can show you. You’re being serious. Merle is missing? And she told Brighton it wasn’t safe anymore. I think it’s real. I’m not trying to be rude or anything, but Merle struggles with... Yes, she struggles but this was chronicled before she was taken by the fae and fed on. List of Order members who apparently co-hunted with the fae. Most of the members have either retired or didn’t make it to retirement, but there’s one who’s still kicking. Jerome. And there’s something else... Merle told Brighton to contact you... that you would know what to do. What? So you didn’t know about this? I’ve honestly never heard of this. And as a member of the Elite, we... know everything. If this is true, then we need to find one of these good natured, non-human-eating fae and quickly. Yeah, you make that sound like it’s something easy. Hell, I think we’ve learned that nothing’s easy. Ren, please. You don’t have to ask, sweetness. Is this okay? I could keep you right here. Right like this. I seriously doubt that’s Amazon delivery. You just busted into the wrong house. Ah! That was funny? What the hell? What kind of tomfoolery is this? A knight. Thou shall not pass! Shit. That worked in "The Lord of the Rings." This needs to stop! - I got this. - Tink, no! Holy shit. What in the actual fuck... There are none of your kind in this realm. - You’re not to be... - No. It’s the middle of the night. Yeah, knights and ancients don’t go poof. We’re going to have to do something about the body because they tend to decompose fast. There’s going to be a lot more than just blood seeping through the floorboards. A good day to you, sir. - How in the... - What? Big things come in small packages. That explains nothing. I’m kind of like a house elf. This isn’t the Wizarding World of fucked up. I’m going to pretend you did not speak of the Wizarding World in such a tone. Anyway, I’m a brownie. We have the remarkable ability that allows us to shrink ourselves just like opossums playing dead. That’s nothing like an opossum playing dead. But it’s the same idea. Are you telling me this entire time you’ve actually been pretending to be small? Not exactly pretending. Being small is the same as being large. That makes no sense. I warned you, Ivy. I even asked if you knew what you had living in your house. Did you know he was actually six feet tall - and anatomically correct? - No. Then shut the hell up. Why would you think it wasn’t anatomically correct? Well, where are your goddamn wings? Oh, I have them hidden. In this form they’re pretty big and would be knocking shit over and considering how unstable you are... I’m unstable because you’re not the size of a Barbie doll. Well, I’m actually more useful this way. You don’t have to carry my deliveries... Oh, my God. I’m going to kill you. Well, that’s a little drastic. I can get behind that thought process. I saved your life. How dare you? I had it handled. It looked like the only thing you had handled was the art of getting your ass kicked. Can you put some damn clothes on? You have a problem with male nudity? I have a problem with your dick hanging out. My, my, how the tables have turned. I think you’re intimidated by my size. Yeah, I’m not intimidated. This is a nightmare. I’m going to wake up in a few minutes, the knight will have never been here, Tink will go back to being a foot small playing with troll dolls. Oh, I’ll still play with them. If it makes you feel better I can return to your approved size. That’s not going to make me feel better. While this shit-show is a pretty big deal, I’m going to have to ask one more question. That knight was gunning for my ass. He didn’t want anything to do with Ivy. Why? Probably because the knight went after the one he viewed as more of a threat. Take out the one that’s stronger first. If knights are coming to Order members houses in the middle of the night and this changes everything. I’m going to buy a deadbolt. I’ll be right back. - I’m sorry, Ivy-divy... - Stop with the cute shit. Oh, I never said anything because you... Let me guess. You never thought it would be an issue. Oh, it’s just when we enter the human realm, we always take this form, it’s a protective measure. - And you found me in that form... - You’re cleaning that up. I’ll clean it up, Ivy, but I don’t like when you’re mad at me. Well, then how about being completely honest with me? Oh. If you knew that I could be this size, you wouldn’t have been comfortable with me staying here. You probably would have tried to kill me. There’s nothing else, Ivy. You know everything about me. Please don’t be mad. I can cut back on ordering from Amazon like maybe down to three... I saw the prince earlier. And you just now say something? How in the world did your towel stay on? Magic. Seriously, what the hell, Ivy, what happened? He didn’t try to take me. He was wooing you, like I said. The prince knows about Ren and the knight had no intention of fighting me. He kept pushing me out of the way. I think he was sent here to take out the competition, to kill Ren. That’s no bueno. Saw your coffee. - It was too sweet to pass up. - Hm. What do you think about Tink? The fact the asshole isn’t the size of my boot bothers me. I’m not saying you should kick him out, but I’d 100 percent support that decision. Duly noted. Tonight, when we get done working, it’s going to be all you and me. And I don’t care what kind of shit we gotta deal with or think about or plan for, when we’re done, I’m going to get you naked. I like the sound of that. I got a real bad pickup line for you. Oh, yeah? I’ve been saving it for just the right moment. Waiting... You’re a work of art. I’d like to nail you to the wall. That is so terrible. I know. Good to see you finally walking through that door. Ditto. Ren. It’s been a while. Good to see you’re doing well. Likewise. What are you doing here, Kyle? Here because we’re needed. And you must be Ivy. David was telling me about you. Nice to meet you. Fought the prince of the Otherworld and lived to tell the story. Amazing. Barely lived to tell the story. Listen up. We have two members from Colorado here, their names are Kyle Clare and Henry Kenner. I’m going to cut through the bullshit. Henry and I are here to find the halfling. And here’s the thing that all of you seem to be missing. If that girl Val was truly the halfling fae wouldn’t let her anywhere near that gate. That would have kept her safe and sound. She isn’t the halfling. Ivy. Slow down. Hey, are you okay? What’s going on, babe? Talk to me. You’re really starting to scare me for real. - I’m the... - Hey! What are you two doing down here? We’re talking. You know something that two people, sometimes more... Hell, even a person when they’re on their own likes you do without interruption. Kyle warned me you were a smart ass. I can see he wasn’t exaggerating. - What’s up? - Kyle needs to speak with you. Kind of doing something right now, I’ll be up to see Kyle... It’s an order. I can wait. You should go see Kyle. Hell. Times a ticking, my man. We’ll continue this later, okay? I think she just got pregnant. You might want to keep your mouth shut if you want to use it later for things like breathing and eating. Text me when you’re done. Will do. Holy shit-storm in the making. Val. Val, stop. Stairs. Really? I was hoping you wouldn’t follow. You hate stairs. Yeah, no shit. Why would you betray us like this? People died, Val. I almost died. Your best friend who trusted you. I never wanted you to get hurt. You followed me and the prince. - Who does that? - Me. I kept thinking they had you under their control. I followed you because I care about you. You almost got me killed. But you weren’t. Were you? That’s not the point. I want to know why you did this. I don’t even care about the Order. - I just want to know why. - You don’t understand. You got your parents killed, Val. Do you know that? That was... sad. - Sad? - Sacrifices had to be made, Ivy. It’s not like they didn’t live a long and happy life. I can’t believe you. Jesus, Ivy. Are you really happy working for the Order, hm? Putting your life on the line every day. You’re happy getting up every morning knowing there’s about a 50% chance you’re going to die that day? We don’t get paid enough for this shit. And it’s not like we can just quit. We were born into this, cosmically pulling the short straw on life, and I know you’re not happy. That’s why you take college classes. But I don’t betray everyone I trust. And if you were this unhappy, you could have just walked away. You have no idea what the other side is like. Other side? What the fae are capable of. And I’m not talking about taking over the world. They are... oh... Let’s just say once you go fae, you never go back. Are you serious? Oh, when they feed... it’s better than a shot of heroin. - You... - Don’t look at me like that. I got cornered on a hunt months ago. I thought I was gonna die. But he took me to Marlon instead. Marlon the ancient. We worked out a deal. He wouldn’t kill me if I helped them find the Order members guarding the gate. So, you know, after a while, it wasn’t even like I was being forced. They’re going to take over, Ivy. And you know what? I’d rather be on the winning side. And, girl, the fae... know what they’re doing. You actually enjoy being fed on? What is wrong with you? Ooh, don’t knock it, babe. Not until you’ve had one that didn’t want you to hurt. Oh, it’s like full body orgasm. Whole thing. That guy you were seeing. He’s a fae. It took you that long to figure that out? You were feeding him information so you could get fucked and fed on? How dare you stand there and lecture me. You’re the halfling. You’ll be screwing the prince soon enough. I won’t be screwing the prince because I actually have taste in men. And I didn’t choose to be this, Val. I didn’t wake up one morning and decide to be a coward who betrays everyone who trusts me. Because that’s what you are. A coward, Val! You deserve that and more. Hitting isn’t nice, Ivy. You know you can’t beat me in a fight, Val. Why can’t you just chill out and... Can’t just let you walk away. You don’t have it in you to kill me. So you’re probably going to try to take me in and... Yeah, I’m not feeling that. Just need to delay this. For what? I knew he’d come. Girls... What do humans say? Why fight when we can make love? That is so incredibly cliché. I smell your blood. This just keeps getting better and better. Oh, I can think of so many ways to make this evening so much better. Don’t get near him. Oh. Babe... I’ve already been near him. Like really near him. If you get my drift. Why are you bleeding? Explain. We were fighting. She attacked me so I had to defend myself. You were to bring her to me, not beat her. I wouldn’t say she beat me. I told you, she just needs more time. I promise... You promised to bring her to me. I do not see how involving fists would accomplish that. I will. Ivy is difficult, Drake. Drake? I did not give you permission to address me so directly. You’re right. I’m sorry. I overstepped. Did you just apologize for overstepping? Are you on crack? And she can’t woo me to the dark side. I’m un-woo-able, so I don’t know what she’s been promising you, but it’s a whole lot of nothing. You can’t use her to get to me, Drake. I didn’t give you permission either. And look how many fucks I have to give: Zero. Ivy, stop. Oh, my lovely little bird doesn’t know when to stop. She’s lucky that she’s necessary. But you... You are not so lucky. You... She was a problem for you, wasn’t she? I... took care of her. She was helping you. As you said. I can’t use her to get to you. So she was... expendable. But you are not. Don’t come any closer. Remember what happened the last time you pulled a weapon on me? Do you really think that’s going to stop me from fighting you? Apparently you do not learn from previous experience. But this time I don’t have to worry about anyone else getting hurt. We’re alone. So I can do anything I want to you. And there’s no one here to stop me. Goodbye. For now. What? - Val’s dead.- I need a little more detail. I saw her on Bourbon and she ran. Chased her to a rooftop on Canal. We fought and she... She fell. Shit. I didn’t kill her. I asked her why she betrayed us. - And then she...- The why doesn’t matter. She did what she did. She’s still out there? Yeah. I’ll send someone. You’re off for the rest of the night. I’m fine. Get your ass off the streets or you find yourself off tomorrow too. All right. Ren. I just heard. Where are you? On Bourbon. Next to Galatoire’s. I’ll be right there. Okay. Ivy. Ivy. I’m sorry, sweetness. I didn’t kill her. - It was... - It doesn’t matter. You facing her down was the last thing I wanted for you. That’s too heavy. I know what you’re feeling. You okay? Your jaw... What did... what did Kyle say? He wanted to talk about the halfling. Plans to ferret out some of the fae, to recapture one of them and maybe get them to point us in the right direction. - But with Val... - She wasn’t the halfling. - I know, Kyle thinks... - I’m the halfling. - What? Ivy... - It’s me. I... I didn’t know until a couple of days after I fought the prince. Stop. I... I don’t know why you think that. Val was the halfling, that makes sense. No. No, it doesn’t make sense. If Val had been the halfling, they wouldn’t have risked her to open the gate. They would have kept her safe so she could be available for the prince. It wasn’t her. Okay. All right. I... I can see why you’d believe that. And you’ve been under a ton of stress... It’s not stress! This isn’t some whacked out theory I’ve come up with. I know you said my parents were in love, but... maybe it was like your friend. I don’t know. But it’s me. That’s impossible. Come here. I know I should have told you as soon as I found out but I can’t lie to you anymore. You must be so disgusted with me. I could never be disgusted with you. I don’t know what’s going on in your head but we can figure this out. Try to get to the bottom of why you think this about yourself. I’ll show you. Sweetness. You don’t have to show me anything. I’m the halfling, Ren. I don’t need you to lie for me or do anything and I hate putting in this position because... I love you. Ren. You what? You... you told me that you’re this thing and then you say that you love me. What is... How did I miss this? No, Ren... You... I just... I don’t even know how to process this right now. I... I... I got to go see David. He needs to know about the knight. You’re not... I ju... I can’t. I can’t do this right now. You came home alone last night, and he’s not here now. Not that I’m complaining. I needed a break from him. Are you fishing? Yeah. If there are fish in my sink I swear to God, I am flushing you down the toilet. Relax. They’re not real fish. I tried to order real ones from Amazon, but alas, they do not sell them. So where is Renny Tin Tin? We had a fight. Really? Yeah. I don’t think he’ll be around for a while. That big of a fight? You didn’t tell him, did you? About what you are? No, I didn’t tell him. What would you do if I died? Why would you even be thinking about that? With everything going on, there’s a chance. What would you do? I don’t know. I guess I’d have to go find someone else with Amazon Prime. Nice. But seriously, you’d have to leave here eventually. You know, take on your... um, bigger form. I know what I’d have to do, Ivy. You don’t have to worry about me. Do you want a fish? Like as a pet? You’d get me some if I said yes? Yeah, I could start you off small with, like, - a beta or a goldfish. - Can I have a ferret? - What? No? - What about a cat? Oh, I watch videos of them on the YouTube. They seem to be sort of mean and I kind of like that about them. A cat would probably eat you if you stay that size. Naw, I think a cat would love me. Especially if you get me a kitten and I raise it. It doesn’t matter if you’ve raised it. The cat will try to kill you at some point. I refuse to believe that. I will hug it and pet it. Forget I said anything about this Nope. Not ever going to forget. Ever. If you had a cat, you’d have to take care of it. I know that. I’d have to get a litter box, preferably one of those self-cleaning ones, cat toys and... That was screwed up. I’d never do that to a kitten. Bye, Tink. What? I came to see how you’re feeling. I’m feeling like I don’t want visitors. Too bad. You look like crap. Well, your house smells like dust and Vicks VapoRub. Oh, insult me while I might be dying. That’s a new low even for you, redheaded demon. But, hey, I brought you chocolate cake. So they’ve essentially told me to get off my ass and get back to the shop. Actually, David doesn’t even know I’m here. No one does. I... Jesus, I didn’t come here to kill you. What the hell, Jerome? Oh, you can’t be too safe these days. I want to know about the fae who don’t feed on humans. You don’t need to be asking questions like that. You don’t know what... I know the Order used to work with them and I know they hid it so deep no one else knows about it. Merle’s been talking. I think she might have gone to one of these communities. Those communities ain’t in existence anymore. You... So you’re saying there are communities of fae who don’t feed on humans, that are good? I said was. They’ve all been dealt with. That’s all in the past. But the knights and the Prince came through the gate. I’m sorry but it’s... You need to go now. - Jerome. - I mean it, Ivy. You need to go now. Don’t have me ask you again. What’s up? Is Ren with you? No, why? He was supposed to come back and talk about some shit that was urgent. He didn’t show. I called him, no answer. I’m going back to headquarters. I’ll see if his car’s still in the garage. Hm. All righty, then. The hell am I supposed to do this? Most people use it to actually kill fae. Oh. You know, when they go out there and work. I just saw a fae in the parking garage. Actually, I saw two. One killed the other and then impaled herself on my dagger. I’m not even sure what to do with that info. You guys? Did either of the faes say anything? One looked like he was about to, but he was killed before he could. She was carrying one of our daggers. Fae had long since adapted the use of iron for their own in a self-policing sort of way. It’s good that you’re here, Ivy. Got some questions to ask you. What’s up? Last night we were chatting with Ren and then he left to meet with you. You still haven’t heard from him? No. That’s why I was in the garage. Ren parked there yesterday and now his truck is gone. He was asking if we knew anything about fae who didn’t feed on humans. Do you know why he would ask something so strange like that? Ren’s always curious about things. Hm. What a weird thing to be curious about. His absence and his timing is strange. Do you have any idea where he would be? No. I mean, I was thinking about checking his place. I’m a little freaked out. Yeah... I’ll send a team out now. What’s going on? Dylan said there’s a lot of police activity down at Flux. This may not have anything to do with fae, but it warrants investigating. - I’ll go. - Not you. I want that report about Val filled out now. But I don’t... Why is it that I always have to tell you that an order is an order? Every single time. I’d rather get shot in the head than do paperwork. Can I ask you a question? If I say no, you still going to ask? Probably. That crystal Val took. What’s the significance of it? Just a piece of shit gem that doesn’t mean much. What? You and I don’t really know each other. Well, to be honest, no one in the Order really knows each other. Except you and Val. You two knew each other fairly well. Fell off a roof, huh? Close with Ren and now he’s MIA. An Elite member missing. That’s odd. Where are you going with this, Miles? Nowhere. Just thinking out loud. Can you not do that? You know what else I can’t not do? Your double negative is confusing as hell. I can’t shake this feeling for about three years that there is something very, very off about you. David trusts you. I don’t know why. But I don’t, Ivy. Thank you for letting me know your personal, irrelevant opinion of me. I appreciate it. I’m going to be cliché as hell. I’m keeping my eye on you. Holy crap, Glenn! Are you part ninja? Whatcha doing here? Just filling out a report for David. I was going to head to Club Flux, see what was going on. Look, I was just there. Look, I’m guessing you’ve seen some crazy stuff since we all have... but this... Oh my God. Detectives are gonna spin it as mass cult suicide. Why are you sleeping on the couch? Are you and Ren still fighting? If so, there’s a chance you might want to see my junk. I don’t want to see your junk again, Tink. A bunch of people were killed last night. Fed on until they died. Well, that’s a buzzkill. - And Ren is missing. - What! I don’t know what to do. Maybe he’s off licking his man wounds? Or maybe the prince has captured him. Both make sense. That’s not helping. Sorry? I’m really not good at saying sorry and sounding like I mean it, but I do mean it. Would now be a bad time to talk about getting that kitten you... So close. Ivy. Ren... Where have you been? I’ve been around. David’s been trying to call you. I thought you disappeared because of what I said - And then I thought... - Ivy. The Prince. His name is Drake, he killed Val. Pushed her off the roof like she was a just some piece of trash. I planned on telling you the truth but... Ivy, it’s okay. I’m the halfling, Ren... I’m this... abomination. You are not an abomination. I’m not even completely human. The Prince wants to knock me up so have his... apocalypse baby. I wish you would stop calling it that. You came to New Orleans to find the halfling. How can this be okay? And now that Kyle and Henry are here, how can any of it be okay? Because I will make it okay. You called me a "thing" after I told you that I loved you, and then you left. I shouldn’t have reacted the way I did. Everything will be okay. Are you hungry? What? Would you like to get something to eat? Let’s eat. So is this part of your plan? You pretend everything is okay and then you turn me in to the Elite? It’s not a trap, Ivy. And the Elite will never get their hands on you. Have you checked in with David? I will later. He’s not really my priority right now. He’s not going to like the sound of that. Cannot say I care. What about Kyle? Henry? He said that... They’re not really my concern either. Are you going to eat? Mmm. Was there something wrong with it? It didn’t taste right. Mine’s fine. I really thought you’d be disgusted with me. I thought you’d be... so repulsed. I could never be repulsed by you. Are you done? Let’s go somewhere. Tink’s at my place. - What? - Well, yeah. The brownie’s always there. Let’s not go to your apartment. Where’d you park? I didn’t feel like driving. I had a lot on my mind. Let’s get that cab. - Want something to drink? - No. You’re nervous. I don’t want you to be. Is it that obvious? I get that things have been tough recently. Tough? I left you without giving you a chance to fully explain. It was wrong, especially after what happened to your friend. Yeah, that was kind of... dickish. I overreacted. Trust me, I regret it. You do? More than you will ever know. Do you... want me to slow down? That’s the last thing I want to do. Ignore it. Ren, if you’re in there, I need you to open this damn door right now. Well... This explains why you haven’t been answering your damn phone. Kyle said you were reliable, that we could count on you. So far, the only thing we can count on is you spending your time getting fucked. Hi, Henry. I haven’t heard from him, huh? He’s quite annoying. Was... not so much anymore. What the hell? Holy shit! Ren, why would you do that? He knew what you were. What? He knew that you were the halfling. How? I don’t know. Well, then how do you know that he knew? And if he knew, then that means Kyle knows. And if Kyle knows, how am I still standing here? They don’t seem like the type to wait around. They will, if they believe that you will lead them back to the prince. After all, they wouldn’t to just take out the halfling. I’m sorry that this bothered you, but it had to be done. I need to take care of the body. I should probably do this alone. It’ll be okay, I promise. I’ll catch up with you later. - Hey. - I found something. What? On one of the old hand-drawn maps, there’s these strange markings in front of certain homes and businesses. They look like crudely drawn wings. Those markings symbolize a safe haven for the fae. - Are you sure?- That’s what it says? I think I know where my mom is. There’s this house. Well, it’s like a mansion, really. But it keeps popping up on all the maps. My mom even has it circled on one of her maps. This mansion is where the Market Street Power Plant is. That old, abandoned, creepy-ass building on Peters Street? Yes. Promise me you won’t go there before I check it out. Okay. Okay. Tink. How did you know it was me? Who else would be calling me from inside my apartment? I don’t know. People, ghosts. Is there a reason for your calling? I might have ordered something. Okay. I definitely ordered something. But not from Amazon. You can’t get these from Amazon. Well, what is it? You’ll see when you come home. Bye! Hey. Where are you? Nowhere. Where are you? At the apartment. It’s been taken care of. We need to talk about what happened. I’ll meet you back at your place, okay? I’ll be waiting. What did you do with Henry? You probably don’t want to know. Who are you? Excuse me. You’re straight up murdered Henry and you’re acting like today’s any other Wednesday. He was going to hurt you. So will Kyle. I’m protecting you. I get that. But I wasn’t in immediate danger. You would have been. And if you’re wondering if I’ll do the same thing to Kyle, the answer is yes. Why are you so surprised, Ivy? They will kill you. - May I... - Have at it? Mm! That is some strong black coffee. It’s the way I like it. No, it’s not. You like it with sugar like me. Actually you usually use six packets or more. You don’t like it black. I like it both ways. Nobody likes it both ways. What did I study in college? Are you feeling well? Answer the question. What did you call me when you first met me? Where’s Ren? I’m right in front of you. You’re not him. Whatever is going on inside your head, we can work this out together. Where is the real Ren? - Ivy. - Don’t say my name. Tell me where he is or I’m gonna make this hurt before I kill you. Start talking! I was hoping you wouldn’t catch on so quickly. Unfortunately, you are more clever than I anticipated. Don’t come any closer. You could have tried to stab me, but you didn’t. As long as I look like him, you will do nothing to me. That was not very nice, little bird. You... Drake. Where’s Ren? You are so aggressive. Where is he? He’s a little occupied at the moment. Is he alive? Answer me. The last time I checked. That could change at any moment. You better pray he’s still alive. And if not? You have to admit this was impressive. If it wasn’t for that stupid cup of coffee... I would have figured it out. Would you have figured it out with my tongue in your mouth or while I was thrusting... Ah! You were so close earlier, weren’t you? I thought it was Ren. You disgust me. Keep telling yourself that. Get off me! You want this body. I’m not sure why. But if this is what it takes... You’re not stabbing me with that. Why do you even try to fight me, Ivy? You know you cannot win. I like it when they fight back. Oh, gross! Shame. But there will be time later. I’m going to enjoy this. Ugh! So difficult. Uh... Oh... Shit. She’s awake. - Where am I? - I don’t answer to you, cow. You guys really need to come up with better insults. Should put that pitcher down before you hurt yourself. No, thanks. We’re having food brought to you. If you misbehave, you will net the consequences. Ooh, scary. I think we should starve you. Maybe then when hunger is gnawing at you, you will gladly open your thighs. Ah! Tastes like wine. Do it. Or I’ll break her in two. The prince will not be pleased to see her injured. No... Son of a bitch. You haven’t touched your dinner. Unchain me. You’ve been awake for all of 5 minutes and you’ve already abused one of mine. One of yours bit me. And she’s been taken care of. I do not want you injured. You have me chained to a bed! Obviously we can’t expect you to behave like a civil creature. Like a civil... I’m gonna kill you. How? You can’t even reach me. You’ll get close enough eventually. True. And when I do, you will be willing. Not likely. You can’t pretend to be Ren anymore. I don’t have to be Ren. I love seeing this on you. It’s like having a rabid cat on a leash. I also love seeing you down here, little bird. Do you really think that I would ever in a million years be with you? I think so. I hate you. I’m not exactly fond of you either. You’re not even attracted to me. Oh, there are times that I find you deliciously attractive. This is one of those moments. Eww. You’ll change your tune soon enough. Oh my God. You... We need to feed. You would too, if you would stop fighting me. They enjoy it? What kind of life is this? You killed those people in the club. - You... - They crossed me. It would be wise to learn from their example. Ren! Did I give you permission to go to him? Please. You will pay for your actions if you displease me. Okay. Oh, God, Ren! Don’t feel too badly for him. He’s caught the eye of Breena and she’s been rather hands on. How romantic. I’m so sorry. - Hey. - Ivy? It’s me. You shouldn’t be here. Neither should you. I told you he was still alive. But for how long depends solely on you. I will let him go... in exchange for you. What? I will let him go right now if you agree to be with me. If not, I cannot guarantee that Breena will be so pleasurable with him as she has in the past. - No, you can’t. - You have a choice. I let this human male go free and you submit to me or I hand him over to Breena and he won’t survive the night. How do I know you’re not lying? I give you my word. Once given it can only be broken by death. And you’d promise to stop hurting him and let him go? Yes. No, Ivy. Don’t. I need time. I can’t just be with you. That’s not who I am. No. If you don’t give me time and stop hurting him, I’ll find a way to end this. You’ll be back to square one looking for another halfling. How much time? A month? - Two weeks. - Three. I have to get comfortable. You don’t need to be comfortable. You just need to let me plant my seed in you. You see, that’s exactly why I have to get comfortable. You sick son of a bitch. You’re not going to touch her. I will end you. Three weeks and you’ll submit to me? Say it. Three weeks and those conditions. And I’ll submit to you. Deal. Marique, he’s to be released. Ivy, no. I’ve got this. Okay? Trust me. Don’t do it. I’m not worth it. Yes, you are. I love you. Don’t you touch her! I will rip you into fucking pieces! Ivy, no! If you think to trick me, I will do things to you that will make you beg for death. Do you understand me? I understand. You still haven’t eaten. Well, we’re here to make sure she showers. So last opportunity to eat. She can still eat afterwards, Breena. - You’re Breena? - I am. You’re on my to kill list. Is that so? Well, I think I know why. Yeah, I bet you do. I told you it wasn’t wise for you to be here. Prince spoke of you. She wasn’t going to forget you. I was hoping she wouldn’t. You know who else is never going to forget my name? My little human pet. You’re disgusting. Well, that’s not what Ren thought. Especially not when my tongue was on his skin. My mouth on his neck. You’re so proud of yourself for forcing yourself on someone. Who said anything about forcing myself? I can be very convincing. You’re about to be very dead. My pet had the most amazing tattoos. I traced my tongue up and down those vines. Shut up. Give me the key. He tasted like man and salt. Not a bad combination. I should go pay him a visit. I doubt you’ll get the chance. I’m going to unchain you now. If you try anything, one of the males will come in. You don’t want that, right? No. Then please don’t go after her. She wasn’t with him that long. She fed on him. That is all. She’s just trying to get a rise out of you. Don’t give her that. Why do you care? Okay. Let’s go. Strip. Do you really have flowers on your bra? Pink panties. How old are you? Go fuck yourself. How about I go fuck your boyfriend instead? Shut up, Breena. And you have a tattoo in the same place as your boyfriend. How cute. It’s okay, you can shower. I felt so alive while I was feeding on Ren. Pretty soon the prince will knock you up, and he’ll cast you aside and I’ll take my rightful place at his side. He wants you to shave. Gross. Humans are so hairy. No way. It’s not happening. The prince wants you to wear this. Are you serious? Well, it’s either that or your naked. Your choice. Please, I can’t wear that. I’m sorry. How cute. You look like you’re trying to play dress up. Ah! I’m going to kill you. Stop it. Valor! Oh! Come on, let’s go. Let’s go. The prince won’t be Pleased with your actions. Worth it. Do you like the dress I picked out for you? No. You should not have gouged Breena’s eyes. I’m gonna kill her. You kill her because she touched your human male. I’d kill her because what she did to him wasn’t consensual. How do you know? Being fed on isn’t something Ren would have wanted. And you think that he truly wants you knowing that you’re a halfling? How do you think that we captured your human male? Breena caught his attention and lured him in quite easily. He saw past her glamour. It’s our job to follow fae when we see them. Breena is beautiful. And you? Well, you. You have this hair. I’m not sure what to make of it. Gee, thanks. I know what you’re trying to do, and it’s not working. You know that when we feed on people, we can see inside of them, pieces of their personality, their wants and desires. One of the things that I picked up from your human male was his concern over Henry and Kyle. You should thank me for removing at least one of those threats. Murdering someone in cold blood isn’t exactly a desirable trait. Do you know what else I learned? Your human male isn’t sure how he feels about you. He’s torn. He cares about you, but he loathes half of what you are. Why should I believe what you’re saying? Because I’ve been inside your head and you share those same fears. Now, why would you want to be with someone who doesn’t fully accept you for who you are? Do you think telling me this is going to help? You made a deal, so in the end it doesn’t really matter. You have 17 days left. I would rather you kill me than remind me of that. I thought you didn’t want to die. Your mere presence makes me wish for a 50 story window to jump out of. Or a moat. A moat filled with dozens of hungry alligators. You always paint such lovely pictures with your words, little bird. I’m going to paint lovely pictures with your intestines. Resist all you want, in the end I will plant my seed. Then once the apocalypse baby is born... Oh, I wish you’d stop calling it that. The apocalypse baby... you’re going to kill me. I’ll be of no use to you anymore. So not wanting this is my life insurance policy. You know, little bird... I plan to keep you afterwards. Your mouth amuses me. Perhaps I’ll have a pretty little cage fashioned for my pretty little bird. Nothing screams romance like being held captive in a cage. I’m going to kill you. I will find a way. That’s a promise. My amusement has its limitations, little bird. There’s something that you haven’t realized. There are worse things that I can do to you than end your life. It’s time you realized that. You’re a fighter, even when it’s useless. I can respect that. But it doesn’t mean I won’t break you. You won’t break me. You’ve already agreed to be with me. I’d say I’m already well on my way, little bird. You know, I’ve only met a few halflings in my many centuries of being alive. Used to have many humans in the other world. Well, they didn’t last very long. The feedings or the environment always got to them. So we bred them, replenishing our stock. Unfortunately, our world has cooled and the environment no longer sustains human life. And without humans, we age and we die. The dying flowers, the cold. It’s because you’re here. It’s adjusting to our needs. The weather will continue to change. Winter is in our blood after all. You joined the Summer court. You... We overtook the Summer court centuries ago. Before we learned of the loopholes in the prophecies surrounding the doorway, halflings were considered an abhorrence. They were killed. As if your kind treats halflings any better. Every once in a while, one of our kind would take a liking to the child and the halfling would grow. Do you know what we discovered about halflings? We learned that they could feed just like us. No. It’s just like a kiss. All have to do is inhale and want it. The first couple of times are like, how do you humans say, taking a hit? You’ll get used to it. It’s time that you discover who you truly are. There is no way I’m feeding off of a human. That’s not who I am. You don’t know what you are. I’ve Ivy Morgan. I’m a member of the Order and I’m human. I don’t feed off of other humans. You are a halfling and you will do as I say. Never. You do remember I can make you? Don’t do this. Please. Don’t make me do this. My will is yours. Show her. You’re hungry. There is a need burning bright in your belly, lighting up every cell of your body. It’s not food that you desire. You need life. You need a piece of her and she can give you what you need. Take it. She wants to give it to you. Show her. Inhale. That’s it. Feed. No. No. You want it. No. I don’t want this. I don’t want you. No. Soon you will say yes. There is no other option. Are you going to put that collar back on me? I hope I will not have to, but I guess that depends entirely on you. Why are you so nice to me? Is it so surprising that my first inclination when I look at you is not to feed on you and kill you? Considering where we are, yeah. The Prince wants her brought to him. If you come willingly, I won’t have to put this on you. Jesus. Do you guys need us to come back or something? I was expecting you. Seriously? Did she eat? A little. If you don’t eat your dinner, you don’t get dessert. Yeah, I definitely don’t want dessert. Do you want dessert? You know I do. You know, who else loved dessert? Do you want me to gouge out your eyes for real this time? I would like to see you try. Enough. You know what your mouth is better used on. Ugh. Ew! As if your human male doesn’t feel the same. He actually respects me. You stand there as if you will still be reunited with your human lover. I find it amusing that you think that he would take you back. If he felt that same way about you, don’t you think he would have found his way back here by now? I don’t need him to save me. It’s time. Time for what? Feed. Can we talk? Talk? I only have a couple more days. Two days, if we’re counting today. You intimidate me into feeding and I’m not myself afterwards. So not all this time counts. And it doesn’t help me feel more comfortable around you. I have been incredibly lenient with you. - Seriously? - Yes. I have removed the collar for now. I have not pushed. I could have gotten you to say yes many times over. Sure, you could get me to agree. But I can’t be under your control, and I have been this entire time. What do you want to talk about? Do we have to talk in here? Where would you like to go? Outside. Not gonna happen. All I’m asking for is a couple of minutes in the sun. If you try anything, you will not like what happens. Okay, just a heads up. Threats don’t exactly make me more comfortable either. Ask your questions. Can we walk? Fine. Ask. What’s the game plan? The baby’s born, the gates open. Then what? There are a lot of humans. Like 7 billion. And I know that sounds like an all you can eat buffet to you, but it’s a whole lot of people who aren’t going to want to be on the menu. Humans are stupid. They have a tendency to stick their heads in the sand. We’ll have complete control before they know it. How are you going to take control? Once we open the gates, all will come through and there are millions of us. There’s still more of us. You mean more of them. You think we haven’t been planning this for decades? Centuries? We are everywhere. Some have even willed themselves into positions of power. You’ve infiltrated the government? Local, federal, global. It’s only a matter of time until we have complete control. We will fight back. And yeah, the fae may have more abilities than us, but we have a reason to fight no matter what. And what reason is that? Freedom. Most humans will already be bent to our will. Human cannon fodder. I’m done with this. - It’s time. - Wait, no. I... We haven’t been out here long enough. I still have questions. You’re only delaying the inevitable. I don’t have to feed. You’ve made your point. You clearly haven’t gotten the point if you keep referring to yourself as a human. It’s time for you to remember what you are. Ivy, stop. Look at me. You will do as I say. Ivy, you need to wake up. The prince is not here. This will be your only chance to escape. What? Oh... I fed again. I know. If you keep feeding, you’re going to get addicted. Addicted? What do you... This will be the only chance before the prince returns, and your time is up, he will be back in this bed. The prince isn’t here? No. He left, taking three Ancients with him. We don’t have much time. You’re going to help me escape? All you need to know right now is the Order are not the only ones that want to prevent the gates from opening. I couldn’t get a thorn stake, but this will do. This’ll do. I will not kill any of them. I will incapacitate, but I will not kill. I’m probably going to kill them. Valor is occupied in the back room at the moment. Can you incapacitate quietly? Because I can kill quietly. What the hell? Where are you two going? Sorry. You don’t have to kill them! They don’t know any better. We’re really going to have to talk about that part later. What? It didn’t kill her. There’s a road about a mile out. We’re going to have to run, okay? Stop! - They’ll catch us. - You’re right. I’m killing this time. It’s too risky not to. Ivy, look out! Did you really think you could escape? Uh, yeah. Stupid. Because of you, she’s going to die and you’ll wish you would have been smart enough to know better. I can snap your neck in a second! I don’t think your prince would be too happy about this. He’s going to find another halfling. He’s going to think you escaped. But in reality, you’re gonna be dead. Ivy. Are you okay? Ivy, it’s okay. Everything’s okay. - I don’t know if it’s you. - It’s me. I’ll explain everything later. I just need you to trust me. Why are there more fae? We have to go. We’ll lose this window. Ivy! Ivy! Ivy? Ivy! Ivy! Oh, my Queen Mab. I thought you were dead or at least knocked up. And I thought I’d be dead because no one but jerk face knew about me. - Ivy, we need to go. - I thought I’d starve to death. - Tink. - Just sitting at home all by myself. Not by myself. But I was worried. Wait, why are you wearing a dress? Come on, let’s go. Yuck. Are we going to the old power plant? Yes. I’m Kalen. This is Dane. I’m Tink. You guys know that. I checked this place out. It was on a map Merle drew. Yeah, we know. Merle is with us. Safe. You guys are the good fae? I told you, not everything is as it seems. We do not use our abilities to manipulate humans beyond protecting what we are. They age and die like humans. I’m a brownie, therefore I do not need to feed. I just age very slowly. I’m guessing you’re probably still in your toddler years, then. I’ll have you know that I’m 200 years old. What? Brownies can live to be over a thousand years old. In human years, he’s barely 20. Eww, sticky. But the power plant, it’s run down and abandoned. We only let you see what we want you to see. Keeps the humans away and allows us to live in peace from... From the Order. Exactly. The type of glamour we’re using on the building can’t be seen through. No ward will break it. We can protect you from the prince. But we cannot put our people at risk. Won’t your kind be at risk once the prince notices I’m missing? The prince is not our only concern. The Order cannot know where we are either. - I won’t betray you. - She won’t. She kept me all this time and never told anyone. Renny Tin Tin didn’t even know about me until he walked down to the kitchen naked with his junk, all hanging out. I’m going to punch you, and it will hurt. Oh, my God. When I first saw it, I couldn’t believe my eyes either. They’ve been here a long time and there are places like this hidden everywhere. You make it sound so creepy. We’re not really everywhere. That’s just Ren being all ominous. I think he’s socially awkward. Or maybe just intellectually stunted. Terrible for my allergies. Come on, let’s go. Make sure you check with Kalen that there’s extra fae standing guard. Absolutely. What is this place? It’s a safe haven. Any one day we can house one hundred fae or more. Ivy needs to shower and rest. What room could she stay in? I think she would like the one that overlooks the garden. The garden room is fine. I’ll get you your clothes. I brought some. And there’s a robe on the door. It’s not yours, but it’s nicer. Does the door lock? From the inside. You’re not being held captive here, Ivy. I’m not there anymore. I’m not there anymore. I brought you some weapons, but don’t let the other fae see them. Iron kind of wigs them out. I had to grab the unmentionables. So I sort of rifled through your underwear. Um, Tink? What’s up with the sling. I didn’t get it from Amazon. Well, I got the sling from Amazon but not Dixon. Dixon, meet Ivy. Are you mad? I’m not mad. Get over here, you little fella. Maybe you should tell Tink what happened. Can you just tell me first? It’s not for kitten’s ears. You left Wednesday morning and that was it. Then about a week later, Ren showed up. He didn’t know how to get back to you. Then a fae showed up. Not a good one. We took care of that together. The fae said he was going to bring Ren’s body back to the prince. We talked about going to the Order, but he knew that wouldn’t be smart. You told him what you are. He would have figured it out eventually. But still, you lied to me. Anyway, Kalen and Dane showed up. We tried to look for you. You worked with Ren? Well, I had to find my Ivy-divy. Thank you. It’s what friends do. And it’s what boyfriends do, right? I don’t know if Ren is my... I think he’s just doing his duty. I don’t think it was just his duty. He wanted to storm that house. As much as it hurts my soul to say this, and yes, I believe I have a soul filled with glitter and rainbows, I don’t think you’re giving him enough credit. He barely slept or ate. He missed you, Ivy. What happened to you? A lot. I know what the fae are capable of. But I know that you’re strong. It’ll be okay. I’m getting sleepy. See you in the morning. Come here, Dixon. Renald. Tinker Bell. Meow, meow. I should’ve gotten there sooner. It’s not your fault. You got there in time. It is my fault. I wasn’t paying attention. I walked right into a damn trap. And because of me, that bastard was able to get his hands on you. I should have warned you. I get why you didn’t. I’m a member of the Elite. Well, was a member. Was? I’ve been M.I.A. For weeks. That’s not going to go over well. I doubt it’s going to go over well for either of us. I don’t give a fuck about the Order. I don’t want to talk about them. I want to talk about us. I’m kind of tired. - I just... - Don’t... shut me out, Ivy. He pretended to be you. After you left, no one knew where you were and you showed up. I thought it was you. And he said he didn’t care what I was. It didn’t matter what I was. I was just so desperate to believe you. And I should have known right then. You’re being too hard on himself. He didn’t like beignets. I should have known right then. And he killed Henry, snapped his neck. If Henry hadn’t shown up, I... Did he... Did he touch you? It didn’t get very far. I’m going to fucking kill him. I got out before he could... It doesn’t change the fact that he did things to you. You sacrificed yourself for me, and I couldn’t do anything to stop him from hurting you. He hurt you, too. What do you remember? I remember him feeding on me. Not a whole lot. But enough to have a kill list a mile long. Do you remember Breena? The parasite with serious boundary issues? Yeah. She’s number two on my kill list. I gouged her eyes out. Well, I tried. You did? You’re the bravest person I know. I’m not brave. I just couldn’t let them hurt you anymore. I love you, Ivy. What? I’m in love with you. I don’t know how long I’ve been in love with you, but it was probably after that night you flipped me on my back and held the dagger to my throat. You’re crazy. Yeah, crazy in love with you. I’m the halfling, Ren. I know who you are. You’re Ivy Morgan. You’re this beautiful, wild and brave woman. And I don’t deserve your love. But I’ll take it and I won’t regret a damn second of doing so. When I was sitting in that damn room before my head got all foggy, all I could think about was you, getting back to you. I didn’t give a shit that you were the halfling. You were sent here to find and kill me. I wouldn’t lay a finger on you that you didn’t want there. The prince made me do things. I can’t imagine what he made you do. But I’m telling you right now, that’s not going to change - the way I feel... - He made me feed on someone. You see? You can’t be with someone who did that. I hurt a woman. I might have... Oh, God, I... I might have killed her. And I could do that to you, too. You would never do that to me. You don’t know that. Did you feed of your own free will? Or did he manipulate you into doing it? He forced me. What if I hurt you? I could never live with myself. You would never hurt me because I love you. And because you love me, too. Hey, it’s okay. Ivy... I got you. I was beginning to wonder if you were going to wake up. How long was I sleeping? You slept straight through yesterday and last night. Jeez, I didn’t mean to. You needed the rest. I’m sorry for crying all over you. Never apologize for that. You wanna cry all over me again, I’m right here. You love me. Sounds about right. Do you have something you want to say to me? No, I don’t have anything to say. I love you. That’s all I wanted to hear. I do wish you were awake yesterday, though, just to bear witness to what I saw. What was that? Tink fashioned some kind of leash for that cat. He was flying and walking and... I’m pretty sure he was naked. Oh, Lord. When that cat gets bigger, he will eat him. One can only hope. He’s kind of grown on me... like a fungus. Do you feel up to talking to anyone? Of course. I feel like I need to wash a layer of sleep off me. You look beautiful. You need to get your head checked. No. I think you might want this back, though. The chain was broken, so I got you a new one. Thank you. After you shower, we’ll go and meet up with everyone, okay? Ivy! Oh! I am so glad you’re okay. Come on. Everyone’s here. I mean, this is Tanner. He runs the place. Nice to finally meet you, Ivy. Nice to meet you, too. You look a bit shocked. Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m just a little out of it. Understandable. I also understand it must be a bit shocking to be here around my people. We used to work side by side with the Order, but unfortunately that joining didn’t last very long. Our ancestors left the other world because they didn’t agree with what the ruling court was doing. They were killing our world, turning all of us into monsters. Most of the fae here are descendants of the Summer Court. They started escaping because they were being hunted. Hunted much like your friend Tink and his kind. The fact that you took care of him told me that we could trust you. Did you guys try and seek me out before this? No. Why do you ask? Before the whole prince thing, a fae followed me into a parking garage. A female fae showed up, killed him and then impaled herself on my dagger. That was not us. I’ll see what I can find out. Did he plant his seed? Can you not phrase it like that again, ever? No. I need to hear her say it. He didn’t, I swear. Good. I would have hated to have to kill you. Mom! What? If she was caring the prince’s child, we would have had to kill her. That is a fact. We do not believe in killing humans no matter the circumstance. Well, somebody should tell Merle that. Why did you tell Brighton Ren would know what to do with the info in the journals? Because this young man has trust in his eyes. We know you’ve got a lot of questions, but we don’t want to overwhelm you. They know how to send the prince back to the other world. What? When my family left, they took a very powerful crystal from the king’s throne, which was then given to the Order for safekeeping. Or at least that’s what they said. Their decision to move the crystal without our permission is what created a rift between our kinds. This crystal has the power to send the prince back to the other world for good. But we don’t know where it is. Okay, so we... we find the crystal, and then what? Then we need the blood of a halfling and of a royal. Like a drop of halfling’s blood. He’s still not happy about that one. Finding the crystal, getting the prince’s blood, and a drop of your blood isn’t the hard part. Well, it sounds pretty hard. The ritual of the blood in the crystal must be completed in the other world. We must open the gates. Okay, have fun. ♪ La la la la la ♪ Dixon has a play date with Auntie Faye. There’s really not room for three. There’s totes room for three. If you have a problem with our closeness, you’re more than welcome to leave. Yeah. I should have let you starve. Whatever. Heard you met with Tanner. He thinks I’m amazing. Let’s ask him what he thinks of you in a few days. Hate the game, not the player. That doesn’t even make sense. I was worried about you, Ivy-divy. You slept like you were a Disney princess who ate a rotten apple. I think you mean a poisoned apple. Same difference. Prince Charming over there couldn’t wake you up with a kiss. That’s all I know. You’re going to need more than a Prince Charming when I beat you ass unconscious. Ooh, so scared. I, um... I just want to thank you guys for not giving up on me. For looking for me and... And for caring. You don’t need to thank us. You never need to do that, sweetness. For once, I agree with the loser. You’re gonna be okay. ’Course she will be. She has us. Yeah. I’m going to be okay. Aw, back together.
