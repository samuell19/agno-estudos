[piano music] [piano music fades out] Hey, buddy. Hi. [piano music] [Trey] There it is. All I do on the piano is compose, which is very slow when I use the paper and compose. And that's it, I don't really play the piano, so... If you're composing, it's great, 'cause you can see how all the chords lay out. When Phish started, I didn't know I was gonna be in a rock band. I thought I was gonna be a composer. [laughs] A lot of the first Phish stuff was heavily composed. This is the tune "Foam" that we do. This is all written out. It's a big chart. It's all... And also "You Enjoy Myself" was that... a lot of the early stuff. It wasn't like rock music. I don't really know what it was. It's a weird band, I mean... It's not really... I don't know what kind of music this is. -[laughing] -[music over phone] You know what I mean? All that shit. One guy who was in the band pretty much quit because he was like, "What the hell is this?" [guitar music] [indistinct singing] This is the boring reality of what I do every morning now. It's just that all these lyrics are wrong. Now I have to write them all down again. ♪ I pulled a thread Out of the air ♪ ♪ Golden and shining As thin as a hair ♪ I always have a lot of projects going on: TAB, Solo Acoustic... but the musical center of my life is Phish. We've been playing together since 1983. [Jon] Yo. -How you doing? -[Jon] Good, man. I'm sitting here, like, working on "Thread" right now. [Jon] Yeah. Yeah. Basically, just refer to the demo for the tempo. -Yeah. -Yeah, yeah. -'Cause it's like-- -I hadn't got that far yet. So funny, I was just sitting here, like,[unclear]. I was just thinking of that tune, like, I was singing-- I know, it sticks in my head so much. -Yeah. -Doesn't it? It's like, ♪ I pulled a thread Out of the air ♪ [scat singing] I think we kind of got it up because we were excited. [scat singing] You know, that was me. -It was hopping right along. -It was hopping. That's the only thing I was gonna say. I really liked "Come Together," "Frost," "A Case of Ice and Snow," and that "Love's Only A Number" thing. That's just the best. [Jon] That one seemed almost the most[unclear] to me, with just, you know, with just the little that we put on it. That's good. That's great. Then Mike will have a couple of songs, and Page will have a couple of songs, and you'll have, you know, whatever. And then we'll have songs. Yeah, that's great. [Trey] We need songs right now because we're trying to do this thing called the baker's dozen, where we're going to do 13 consecutive nights at Madison Square Garden, and we're gonna try to do them without any repeats. So, that'll be probably about 280 songs. You know, most bands do a similar show every night. So my head is kind of exploding with the whole thing. It's exciting. I am writing this longform thing that I'm into now. This Ghosts of the Forest idea. My oldest friend Chris is now in this battle with cancer. He's stage four. He used to hunt elk. That's, like, where the title idea came from. Ghosts of the Forest. They called elk "ghosts of the forest" because you could be following a trail and they just vanish. You never know when the trail is going to end. I was thinking about my only sibling has passed away. Chris and both the girls have grown up. It's all just so fleeting.

I wrote a song about my sister called "Miss You" after she died. Once that door opens, it's like a floodgate. Suddenly you want to start writing about what you're really feeling in your personal life in a much more direct way. Suddenly, I'm writing about Sue, and I'm writing about my family and friends. And I want to talk to them and find out what is my mom's perspective? You know, what is my dad's perspective? Even as a parent, I've got my own story about how I raise my kids and stuff. You know, and maybe I just wanna learn the truth. My dad worked in Princeton. My Mom never really fit in Princeton. She's a New Yorker through and through. When I was 18, she said, "Go raise some money." We painted a couple of houses or something and I went and became a street musician in Europe. That's the kinda thing she would always encourage me to do. Very creative, wrote books. All kinds of creative people on that side of the family. [Dina] I think I've told you this before, when you were really little, four, five, six, you went to so many plays all the time. Peter Pan... [Trey] South Pacific, West Side Story. [Dina] I mean, Kristy and you, you both knew the lyrics to every single Broadway song. [Trey] Yeah. [Dina] A lot of Kristy's friends come and have lunch with me on this bench. So it's like, "Let's go to Kristy's bench and have lunch." And, you know, it's really good. -[Trey] I love the bench. -I love the bench. You know, during that whole time, I mean, you were... I don't know what we would have done without you. There's no good thing to say when it sucks. -I know. -It just sucks. It sucks. Anyway, there you go. But back to music. [laughs] I remember you guys had big parties. -We had big parties. -And they went on for two days -with the speakers on the roof. -We did. And everybody was listening -to great music. -We were, like, young. Early 20s. But your sense of adventure was magnetic and also paved the way. Yeah. Like, when you're like, "I'm going to Barbados with a backpack." You know, to go live on the beach. And then when you're like "I'm off to India." It basically said to me that that's a possibility. -[Dina] Yeah. -I know it was important to you that both Kristy and I knew -there was a world outside of... -[Dina] But yes, and-- ...that suburban block that we lived on. [Dina] Definitely. You try and do the best you can, you know? I don't know. Remember in hockey we had the lead puck and everything, remember? And the 50 shots before dinner. And all that stuff, it was great. I loved playing hockey because it was fun to be good at something, and I loved playing hockey because it was with dad. And I wanted to do stuff with dad. -[Dina] Yes. -But no matter how good I got, like, it wasn't enough. -It was, like, never enough. -[Dina] That's true. In the meantime, I was playing music. -Yeah. -And-- -Happy. -Oh, man. Every bit of, like, anger and frustration and joy was coming out in music. You never stopped drumming. You drummed all the time when you were two, three, four. It was like "du-du-du-du." And you used to sit behind me in the car and... It's like... Like this all day long, for long car trips. Like, "Trey!" And then remember in the fifth grade, you're getting kicked out of class? -Yes. -That was why. "Stop drumming, Trey!" And you couldn't. And I became-- I got kicked out of chorus for drumming. [Dina] You must have been born with just way too many notes in your brain. And you'll spend a lifetime never getting them all out. Then I looked at you up there, and I think, wow, "He is so happy, and how great is that?" It feels like everything just fell into place. And the result I can read on other people's faces. It's not just that I'm having fun. It's that they are, you know what I mean? Or Page is. I felt like that with Tom, like, in eighth grade when we'd, like, write a song. All of a sudden, we'd be like, "Oh!" [Dina] I thought it was great. -A lot of things-- -It was scary at times. I didn't like it at times, because it was scary because it was too big. I felt like you just were trapped in this madness, and you couldn't see a way out. I think that's why things went south, you know. The first time you played at Madison Square Garden, and everybody was, like, taking pictures of the marquee, and oh my God, your name was up there. Phish was up there. This was the most exciting thing ever. We were so happy. And then to stand back and look at these people, all these people... I thought this is just too scary, and it's going to get bigger. It just scared me to death. And I was right. [laughing] It did get a little big there for a while. [guitar music] [Trey] When I'm in the barn, I feel the presence of my grandmother, my grandfather, the lost and the loved ones. They're all a part of me. I don't float through life alone. I float through life with pieces of my father, and pieces of my mother and friends. You know, we're part of a tapestry. And so this album is a lot about that. ♪ We're all here together And the weather's fine ♪ ♪ Dancing in a dream Beneath the sea of stars ♪ ♪ The lights are crashing And the waves are splashing ♪ ♪ Dancing in a dream Beneath the sea of stars ♪ A minor. [Trey] Fish and Tony were two of the first people I met when I came to Burlington and two of the most important musical collaborators in my life, and they've never played together. I thought this project would be a great chance to start it off with the three of us. Build it from there. That's great. When you make records, you clean up all the edges, for, like, presentation. Put, like, a click track on this, to make it straighter. I don't want to do that anymore. I want to be organic and alive and in the moment, and, like, in the now. [calming music] Hello? It's become a tradition that Phish plays every New Year's Eve at Madison Square Garden, and at midnight, we do a thing that we call "the gag theatrical event." And this year, I have a really cool idea that I can't wait to share with the guys. We're going to turn Madison Square Garden into an ocean, and the stage is gonna become a pirate ship floating on top of it, carrying us along over the audience. It's gonna be really cool. -Yo! -Brother! [indistinct] [laughing] I got that from this guy... It's 26 inches. [Trey] It's gonna contribute to my deafness is the problem. [Jon] That's where I keep all my, like, drum doodads. -Your herb. -Yeah. [Trey] Greatest thing you ever told me was that Tommy Lee really liked our Rolling Stonescover. [Jon laughing] Yeah, yeah. Yeah, He did. That was, like, the only thing he said to me. [laughing] "Hey, man. I really wanted to be..." -I was like "Thank you!" -With the caveman? -Yeah. I had a tutu. -The shirt off. [Trey] He said something like, "Yeah finally, a band." [Jon] That was his thing, was, like, a band on the cover, -like, not trying to be cool. -Not giving a fuck. [Trey] "You guys really aren't cool!" [all laughing] -Isn't that fucking amazing? -It was great. It's a miracle that we still have a career, after trying so hard just to sabotage it. [Jon] No band has worked harder shooting themselves in the foot. [Trey] Destroy their own career. Yeah, that's great. Alright, let's just try this. Okay. One, two, three... [upbeat music] That'll work! ♪ Well, everyone's together On the soul planet ♪ ♪ There's one beating heart On the soul planet ♪ I think that was good! I love the half thing. -Yeah well that's-- -That's pirates up there like, moving the sail -at that point. -Well, that's the thing. -It's like... [grunting] -Yeah. Pulling ropes and shit. It's like you can't get enough of that. [Trey] You can't... -You can't do too much of that. -There's never enough half. There's never enough halving off the beat. You have to put vocals on top, 'cause everybody is... Right, the "wind is the music" part? Yeah, I thought maybe I would do just the regular "wind is the music." That'd be great. 'Cause I thought Page is doing the "wind is the music" was a little high. He might maybe do that. Or you can do the "soul planet." -Oh, soul planet, right, right. -...through space. You can kinda do whatever you wanna to do. ♪ Everyone's together On the soul planet ♪ ♪ There's one beating heart On the soul planet ♪ ♪ Dancing and breathing On the soul planet ♪ And you go, "soul planet!" ♪ Soul planet! ♪ And everyone's together And there's one big ocean ♪ ♪ And the ocean is love -♪ And everybody's reaching -[blowing] ♪ And we're leaning On each other ♪ ♪ On the soul planet Visually, there's a lot to it, but musically, it's just fucking rock, which is great. It's just a pocket. Get a good pocket going and go. Kinda minimal arrangement, -you know. It's like... -My favorite part, by far, is that we're passengers on the boat, and the wind is the music blowing us along over the sea of people. [Jon] You can definitely get behind that. I mean, it is what we've been doing for 34 years. That's what it feels like. Except when it's bad. -Well... -And then it feels like... -It feels like-- -When it's bad, -it's me doing it. -[laughter] Then it feels like it's just sort of like the boat's taking on water. It's just, you know, listing, and everybody's panicking in their own way. I wanna show you this picture. [both laugh] -Who's that? -C Cott. -Is that C Cott? -Yeah, he's bald now. -Oh my God. That's awesome. -[Trey] Isn't that great? Looks like a badass, -doesn't he? -Oh, yeah. -[Trey] I like it. -He's always looked like a badass. That's a great photo. -[Trey] I know. -I've never seen him with-- [Trey] His hair was falling out from the chemo. Oh! He's gone through chemo? -Yeah, you didn't know? -I didn't know that. -Yeah. -Oh, Jesus. He's got stage four cancer, it's, like, it's bad. -C Cott? -You didn't know that? -I didn't tell you? -I didn't know that at all. -No. -It's so weird. I didn't tell anybody for, like, a long time. I just didn't want to talk about it, because it was, like, really bumming me out. But he did a biopsy and they found out he has adrenal cortical cancer, stage four. -[Jon] That sucks. -Like, serious cancer. [Jon] He might beat it. He's the kind of guy that if he beat it, I actually wouldn't be surprised. -I hope he does. -Yeah. He's a great guy. Anyway... [somber music] The first day I ever came to Burlington, I was 18 years old. I came to look at UVM. I went out and I saw Big Joe Burrell & The Unknown Blues Band. ♪ I'm going to rip it, rock it Really pop it ♪ ♪ Flip it, flop it Dance it, rock it ♪ ♪ Every time I hear That saxophone ♪ [Trey] One of the greatest, most life changing nights ever. ♪ Roll, roll, roll ♪ Bop, bop, bop [Trey] And Tony Markellis was his bass player, who's now the bass player in TAB. And that was, like, a big part of the reason I wanted to move to Burlington. Here's my dorm from when I was a freshman. Right there, there's Fish's room. He was a few halls down from me. He was a freshman, and he had his drum set in his room. And I went over and jammed with my amp. We started jamming right away. That was, like, 35 years ago. When we were just starting out, we used to play at Nectar's over there. This was the band's house. This house. This is where we lived. That was Fish's room, right there. Every day at one o'clock, I would have to go up there and wake him up. He liked to sleep. The Nectar's is one block there. So we would go over there and we'd do three sets. He'd say, you know, "play 'Mustang Sally,'" or "play a slow one." And then at 7 it would kinda switch to, like, bar scene, and then for the late night set, all our friends would be there and it would turn into this crazy Icculus Gamehendge, people screaming and all this stuff. Then afterwards, we would usually go out till two in the morning, go out to, like, the Quarry or go to Howard Johnson's or something like that. I remember walking in that door with all the sheet music that was "You Enjoy Myself." And Jeff, our first guitar player, would just be like, "What is this? I'm not doing this." And Page being like, "I'll do it, yeah let's do it." In the basement, and then learning all the [hums notes] down there. It says The Hood Plant. It was the hood plant. That's where, you know, they packaged the milk, when we were living there. And that's where the song came from. A previous owner of this small house was named Mr. Miner, so we used to get all his mail. And then we got these like... [laughing] You know, like, Publisher's Clearing House... "Thank you, Mr. Miner." And we were always like, "Thank you, Mr. Miner." Turn around there, you look up on the second floor. That's where Sue lived. She was, like, a waitress at [unclear]. She lived right up there. And I lived right here. She was 19. Still together. All right, let's go. -Dude, man. -[Page] What's up, buddy? -How's Fish doing? -Fish is good. What a fucking distance he's gone. Yeah. -From the fucking laundry pile. -Right? [laughing] You remember that? Like in the green house, he had a laundry pile and two drumsticks. He didn't even have a bed. No, I know, he would just sleep on a laundry pile. He just slept on a laundry pile. I go up there, he's got five kids, amazing wife... -He's got a bed. -He's got a bed! [both laughing] He's got a bed. -It's like-- -Country mile. [Page] It's in B. [Trey] It's just like, put everything in B, 'cause it's good for these. -[Page] Great. -I just... Putting it in B gets me... yeah. -Wait, stop for a second. -Yup. So it goes... ♪ Well everyone's together On the soul planet ♪ ♪ There's one beating heart On the soul planet ♪ ♪ Bouncing and breathing On the soul planet ♪ ♪ We keep on...

[Page laughs] That's also good. -That's cool, man. That's great. -[Trey] That sounded so good. It's gonna be great. It's gonna be really fun. -That's gonna be another year. -[Trey] Another year. They keep coming. They just keep rolling. 18. It doesn't seem like 18 years -since Big Cypress. -Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That's a lot. At Big Cypress I had a 6-week-old daughter, and now I got an 18-year-old daughter. Here we are. We've come a long way from the little house. Yeah. In a lot of ways, I think this last year has brought it back to that fun. I really think that -the fun we were having... -I agree. ...when we were rehearsing in the basement or up in Fish's room there at the little house and the comfortableness of walking on stage and having fun, and just, it felt very similar to walking on stage at Nectar's, and just having all those people there and, you know, loving it and just the joy of it. It's still there. It was hard to keep a close hold on that joy for all those 30 years or 35 years or whatever, but I really feel like it's back. I'm back to that spot again where I'm feeling that joyous about it again. It's back, baby. [both laughing] -I agree, man. I really do. -Alright, man. -That was great! Thank you. -See you soon. Thank you! When I was, like, 16, my parents were getting divorced. And I remember a tangible feeling of things coming apart. Everything was kind of falling apart. My sister was off to college, we were selling the house, and my music friends became sort of my new family. And they still are to this day. [lively rock music] Okay. [guitar music] Man. Dude, that amp sounds... [laughs] I can't believe how good that amp sounds. What's the dynamics sound like? [Ben] That's the dynamic, and... [guitar playback] Well, actually, it's not that different. Try the ribbon. [Ben] I've got to adjust the gain over here. -Ah! -[deep bass] Does that sound cool up there? Can I hear that? That's great, man. That's, like, fucking funeral shit. Hold up, one more time. Now move it to here. [wordlessly sings] I just really liked those bass notes alone, you know.

[piano music] -Fucking awesome, man. -It's great. Talking about things I've never done before? This. Like this kind of an album. Like, emotional, spacious... We're like the playing band. [trills notes] Like, the way that it's... I don't know, things just go where they go. I can't vouch for anything. You know, like I said, it's gonna just roll forward and all of a sudden one day it's gonna be like "It's done!" Whatever it may be. This might just be like a guidepost to something that gets played live, who fucking knows? I just can't tell.

It's where my kids grew up. Just sort of... [gasps] ♪ Ghosts of the forest I'm really feeling it now, the whole ghosts of the forest thing. 'Cause I used to hang out back here a lot. Like, I always walked to the barn through the woods. I think I see it. I could just knock on the door and say, "Can I look inside?" I put that basketball hoop up. I feel like a creeper looking at this guy's house. Hello! Sorry we're walking through your woods. -Hi, I'm Trey. Nice to meet you. -How you doing? -You used to own this house. -I did. I didn't mean to, like, be creeping you out, walking through your woods. It's Vermont, we're pretty casual. -We were just like walking-- -You had a camera crew. You couldn't have been up to too much. -No. -[both laughing] -Hi! -Hi! I'm Trey. We met at South End Kitchen one day. -Yes! I remember that! -And we talked about our house-- -Oh, my God! We've met! -Yes. Welcome. -Is this freaking you out? Okay. -Not a bit. If this isn't freaking you out... -No, no, no. -Going out to get dinner. So great that you guys got the garden and the chickens going. -We're trying. -I love this house. I love this house. Why don't you guys come in? -[Trey mumbling] -C'mon, come in. Oh my God. [gasps] Thank you for letting me look at this. I'm taking these off. Hi! I used to live here. -[boy] You're Trey. -Yeah, I play in Phish. Opal, she goes to my school too and she's in my grade. And she told me you guys used to live here. I was like, "Wow!" Did you guys have the room, like, upstairs? That was sort of like my little studio. -Like, I had a... -[all laughing] I had a soundboard in there and I used to write songs. Cool. Did you play any of the songs that you've written there? [Trey] Oh yeah! Some of the biggest Phish songs were written up in that room. Because that's the room with a really good vibe. I don't know whose room that is... -Mine. -...but whoever it is -must have a good vibe. -[Trey laughing] My daughter was born right here. [woman] That's the chair that I sit in at dinner! -[Trey] Right there. -[all laughing] Her crib was right there because she liked the warmth of the wood stove. And so I wrote a song about her, it's called Billy Breathes. That was her nickname, was Billy. She was so little, and I was, like, knocked out by the fact she was breathing. "Oh, my God!" So I wrote that song up on that hill. ♪ Time, it seems In broken dreams ♪ ♪ To sleep beside the stair -♪ Oh -[upbeat music] The rest of it's all music. Rest of it's all the words. But then there's a lot of music in the middle, which is kind of, like, what Phish does. [laughing] -Fish crams a lot of music. -That's very cool. Fantastic. -You guys got the best house. -[woman] We know. That was so kind of you to let us in here. We just made our Christmas card, because that's the only picture that four of us are in. You gotta, like, just black me out. Cross me out. With this stalker we found in the middle of October walking through our woods. All right, we're going. [guitar music] Morning Mike, I love being at your old house. -How are you doing? -Good. Jared turned me on to this. It's five loopers, and one's to use with your hand. And you can instantly shorten them and lengthen them -and add effects. -It's a Kaossilator? It's just like a standard Boss looper. -Got the classic 808 too. -[Trey] What is that? That's... This is what, like, all the classic... The first hip-hop songs were all made on this. [Trey] Really? But it's old school. [bass music] What do all these knobs do? [techno music] [laughter] [Trey] So it goes... ♪ And the ocean is love ♪ And everybody's reaching Now it goes... Right there. It goes to the outro progression. Okay. ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah E to G. When we go to F sharp, they've turned the sail. Like, with your bass, you're, like, turning the sail. -It's huge. -Okay. And you go... [wordless singing] And Fish is like... [wordless singing] That F sharp... And then the whole thing is starting to turn backwards now. Facing the back of the Garden. And the guys are pulling the ropes and the fans are filling the sail with wind. [laughs] -Done! [laughs] -Yeah, that's awesome. [Trey] This is where you are decluttering? I'm just kinda like piecing things chronologically and then throwing a lot out, so... [Trey] You're not gonna throw that out. Look at this, man. Look at how close we used to be. Yeah. [Trey] I see videos from this period of time occasionally. And me and you are so physically in sync. -It's like one person. -Yeah. And it makes me sad that you're so far away. The tab behind the beat. I'm so happy that the sound is so good on stage that it's okay, but I kinda want to walk over next to you. -Look at this from-- -Look at Fish! In a dress! -Speaking of New Year's... -That's at the Dude show. Oh, that is great. Please bring that back. [Mike] At least for Halloween. It's pumpkins. [Trey] You look like you could be in, like, an amazing '80s band. What are you doing with all these? Can you send-- [Mike] I'm just putting them chronologically. [Trey] Are you sending them to Shapiro? [Mike] This is Kevin. See these here? -This is all Kevin here. -Throw that shit out, dude. [Mike] Well, some of it's just crappy. [Trey] Oh my God. -Is that the Clifford Ball? -It's one of the first one, 97. -Oh, Clifford Ball is 96. -[Trey] That's a great one. That's a great one. Look at that picture. [Mike] Not bad for our second festival. [Trey] That was not bad for our second festival. [cheerful music] [laughing] Good dog! You like music, don't you? [cheerful music] [Trey] This album is a lot more personal. There's a lot of fear and confusion in this album. And sadness. And I'm not even close to done, and I'm already getting to the point where, like, some days I put it on and I'm like "I hate this." And the next day, I'm like, "Oh, this is okay." I'm kind of a little bit lost at sea in that way, to be perfectly honest. I want to be alive and in the moment, like, in the now. You know what I mean?

[Trey] When I was a kid, I was lucky enough that my dad wanted to coach me in hockey. At the same time, he was very intense, and there was a lot of pressure. I just wanted to please him, and there were times when I felt like that was an unachievable goal. -Where are we going, dad? -Bent Spoon for ice cream. I'll take a little Bent Spoon. [Trey] Then I got older and I started to see that everything I learned from him taught me how to live. I mean, he taught me to see a goal and achieve it step by step. He taught me to be in a team, which is what being a band is. And I'm so grateful to him for that now. You know, I hope I was a good dad to my kids. [Ernie] And we'll park here. Perfect. I'll take care of the meter. You do not want to get a parking ticket. They are $45. [man in background] Welcome home, Trey. [Trey] Hey, how's it going? Nice to see ya. -This happens all the time. -Hi, nice to see you. Oh Jesus, this is fucking insane. Hi Sammy, I'm Trey. Nice to meet you. [Ernie] This happens all the time. -[Trey] Thank you so much. -Thank you. -Have a good time. -Have a nice day. -Nice to meet you. -Bye, nice to meet you too. [Ernie] Mmm. Mm. Good. The one thing that I really wanted for you was a bachelor's degree, because I thought if Phish didn't work out, the bachelor's degree would give you more flexibility as a musician. You could teach if you chose to. Right. What I didn't want was for you to be restricted by not having a degree. Of course, it all turned out to be moot, because who cares now? Right, right. But back in the Kenny's Castaways days. I wasn't certain it was gonna work out. If you thought any differently, you would be insane. Yeah, of course. The night where I really became aware of the phenomenon... -Yeah. -...was The Paradise in Boston. -Right. -When we showed up there and the street was blocked off, and there were 5,000 kids in the street trying to get in an 800 capacity club. That night, it was clear that you actually were building something... Right, right. ...that had legs. Now. Did I ever think you could be at MSG 54 times? No. You know, everything turned out great. -There were challenges. -What were the challenges? I'm trying to think of questions. There was one major challenge. Your health. Which you dealt with. Right, right. After the arrest, the drug court and all that other kind of stuff, it turned out exactly as it should have. Let me borrow one of your napkins. I remember-- I'm talking about more, like, the Taft era. And then, you know, like, I came home, we were living in the condo and I had people in the basement... I remember that. I have fond memories of those six months when -we were living in the condo. -Right. I do too. We didn't have any big conflicts. No, actually, no. I don't remember it that way at all. I actually have nice memories about that. We used to have four Brown 'N Serve sausages, a slice of American cheese and an English muffin for breakfast. And then for dinner we had four Hebrew National hot dogs, a slice of American cheese and an English muffin. I have great memories of that. I loved that. And we had iceberg lettuce salads with Good Seasons dressing. He's right. There were no women around to tell us not to do it. There were no women, no. [Ernie] Some of the fondest memories I have from then it's the night we watched The Day Afteron TV, you went downstairs and started to compose "Divided Sky." I have very vivid memories of all that, and it's one of my favorite things you do today. I was proud of you before anybody knew who you were other than me. Truly. Very proud of you and all you've done. As a father and a citizen, I'm as proud of you for that kind of thing as I am for you as a musician, for being a good father, a husband and all those kinds of things. You are the best role model, I have to say. The hardest thing in my relationship with grandpa was my failure to learn how to communicate with him when I was younger in ways that reflected what my real needs were or my problems were. I didn't know how to do it. I didn't have the mechanism of vocabulary, or experience or insight. [Trey] Do you feel like he put lot of pressure on you? -A busload of pressure on you. -Yeah, in the same way I put pressure on you. I would find ways to rationalize it or defend it, account for it, but yeah. You know, when you think about the rigorous practices-- Well, I mean... Go ahead. I put a lot of pressure that was probably motivated in the right way, but executed in the wrong way. Never putting myself in your shoes. Because if I had for a minute, I might have understood that I was communicating in a more harsh way or more demanding way or a more deliberate way than was necessary. Right. So today, 77 years old, I would behave in different ways than I did when I was 23 years old. Right. I don't beat myself up about it so much that I'm depressed, but I think about it. [uplifting music] [Sue] Citified by then. You're too cool for school. [Trey] Do you remember how fun it was taking our daughters on tour every summer? -[Sue] It was the best. -Wasn't that incredible? It was my favorite family times. On the bus, five or six weeks, at least, across the country and back. And it was amazing. Locked in a bus, you know, at that age. -[Trey] Yes. -[Sue] It was very special. And then remember the Star Trek? We had Star Trekrunning all the time, so whenever you got on the bus, -it sounded like the Enterprise. -Oh, yeah. We had the DVD series "Do you guys watch Star Trek every night?" -[beeping] -Every tour had it's own... -There was a Star Trektour. -That was great. There was a Lord of the Ringstour, -the Doctor Whotour. -I loved that. From the get-go, we started dating. -Like the first time you had-- -[Trey] I remember that. After our first date, we went to Nectar's and the next day, I had to do, like, a six-day Southern tour. [Sue] Right. [Trey] I don't remember any blowback from you ever about that. [Sue] No. [Trey] Probably almost like the opposite. Were you were kinda like, "Go, go, have a good time." -You've been home a while. -Yeah, no, I-- Something to do. Yeah. "Don't you have something to do?" "Don't you have some tour to go on?" Lily's been having fun, for the most part. A couple moments. [laughs] So fun. A couple not fun moments. No fun due. You know, you were using, and I was drinking a lot. It was it was all part of the social anxiety. It was my way too of managing that whole craziness. So when all that went away, it was just... You know? Yeah. I don't know what... You would have died, I think. I thought you were going to die the night got arrested. That's what I thought when the phone rang at 4 in the morning, "Well, this is it." Very fortunate, very grateful. You know? Yeah. [Trey] Did you ever regret marrying me? No. No. No, really! [Trey] In my mind, like, everything had like gone... -[growls harshly] -[Sue] Yeah. [Trey] It was sort of like, you know, like I had failed and I messed up. -That's how I felt. -Yeah. Kinda always felt you kind of figured that out. I knew you did. That's why I knew you wouldn't leave. [laughing] I never thought you would, anyway. I didn't want to leave, that's for sure. Nope. No way. I'm not going anywhere. -You're stuck with me. -I know. You're too lazy. [Trey] I'm too lazy. [both laughing] [Sue] You're too lazy to go anywhere. [soothing music] [belting notes] [saxophone music] [man] Vegan flan. [woman] Martian eggs and non-organic unicorn milk... [Trey] Chris is like a funny guy. 'Cause he's like a hard partying, gruff mountain man. But inside, he has, like, the biggest heart of anybody I've ever met. He called me up, he said, "I just went to the doctor. They said I had stage four adrenal carcinoid cancer." It's like a 4% survival rate. And you know, my sister died of cancer. You can't think of the 96, you got to think of the four. Four people survived. -[Trey] We met when we were 15. -[Chris] We were 15 at Taft. You loved fucking Led Zeppelin. [laughter] I was way into the Dead. I had a fucking big stereo, too. My stereo was bigger than yours. Your speakers were bigger than mine. -So I win. -[both laughing] Remember Copenhagen? -Remember? -Right! -Did we take a ferry though? -That was a part of it. -Playing hockey. -'Cause we were like skating down the hall. Out on the deck of the ferry. [whooshing] Sock skating around in the dark. There was this torrential storm. And finally we got to Amsterdam at, like, seven in the morning. He takes two hits of acid out of his pocket. And he goes... I said, "If you are a true friend of mine, you're not gonna let me do this by my myself." As they were sitting on my tongue. It was, like, seven in the morning. I had a day off and I had to play two shows. And I had been up all night. I was like "Ah!" -I was like, "Okay." -"All right, fine." So then he gave me two hits of acid. So then the next thing you know, we're, like, walking around Amsterdam for, like, a million years. We rented bicycles. [Trey] Oh, yeah. There is eons of stories. Just... I don't know where to begin or where to end. You guys want a dose? [laughter] Chris has a... Do you want to tell them about the port where you put liquid acid in? He has a port here. Fresh edition. -Right there. -That's it. [Chris] That's the magic port for putting... [laughter] It's way more effective that way. Right into the main line. The liquid... And to think, we spent all those years putting the liquid in our eyeballs. -[Chris] Nothing compared-- -Tomorrow we're going to the hospital so I can get a port. -'Cause I can't keep up. -[Chris laughing] [somber music] [rock music] [crowd clapping] God bless you, Bruce.

Oh, my God. It was a big whoop-dee-do. She would hold on to you so you couldn't get out the door. And would scream and scream.

I thought you were the coolest person I'd ever met in my life. I loved the way you dressed and stuff. But you were into, like, your thing, and it wasn't that. [Bella] It wasn't that, Phish, yeah. And the crowd was, like, going "Yeah!" And I was walking down the stairs this one night, and you were at the bottom, it was just me and you, I was having dad-daughter rock tour. I was so excited that you were on the road with me. We were both on the bus. And you were like, "I'm so bored!" And then you go, "You just entertained all those people, now entertain me!" I was kind of dejectedly walking behind you. And they were still cheering, but I was thinking this is such a metaphor for, like, parenting teenage girls. [Bella] It wasn't really weird until just these past few years when I started going on Phish tour. -Right, right, right. -And now I'm like on Phish tour. -Right. -And like, most of my friends outside of Burlington are friends that I made through the scene. -[Trey chokes] Yeah. -[Bella laughing] [Trey] I just breathed in a bug. -It's really gross. -[laughing] Is there anything you wished would have been different? I had a very happy childhood. I was always happy with you and mom. Like, generally all the things I, like, think about that I would have changed were, like, my shit, you know. And like, I guess, yeah, you and mom definitely weren't amply prepared to deal with me. It was very clear, like, when I started dealing with issues and stuff, that you guys didn't know what to do. -Right. -You were, like, "Oh, God," freaking out. And it worked out, you know. So it's all fine. But, like... Defiantly in the moment I was, like, I was freaking out, because I felt like I was freaking you guys out. Ah. I was like, you know, you guys clearly seemed... I think you can't help, that, like, as a parent, thinking, "You know, is it my fault?" Or is there things that, like, you know, -"What could I do differently?" -Yeah. Maybe the thing was I was very, very aware of you guys thinking that. And I was like, it just so... hindered you from being able to objectively help me the best that you could because you were distracted, I guess, by, like, worrying about being a good dad. Right, yeah. So, like... which, like, wasn't the problem. Right, right, right. That seems like a big responsibility, though, for you in that moment -to be worried about us. -Yeah. You know what I mean? That doesn't seem fair. Like, you had a lot to think about other than worrying about us. We were okay. [laughing] Man, look at this place. Wow.

"Was I there for them?" I certainly understand my own parents more. Bella is a senior in college, and Eliza's graduated and working. And it reminds me that that's the age I was when Phish started. I think about my perception of my parents at that time and my feeling of wanting to break away, and "I'm going to be in a band. And we're gonna to travel all over the world and get out from this." Whatever it was. Today, I feel exactly the opposite. I feel how fleeting certain things are and how precious they are. ♪ It's such a beautiful world ♪ And such a brief time Let's eat food. I think the first New Year's we played was the Boston expo. It wasn't much of a gag at all. -It wasn't theatrical. -It really wasn't a gag at all. We all wore tuxedos and Fish wore the G-string that was a tuxedo. [Page] New Year's 94 was the hot dog. Then we did a series of four runs with a fish tank created on stage. The next year was the time machine, which was we did a good gag with a guy that looked like Fish, in the diaper. [Trey] Then, one of my favorites that gets forgotten, is that we did the angels on ladders. -[Page] The snow queens. -[Trey] On Seven Below. [Page] And we had the snow falling. [Trey] The snow was falling and we had beautiful angel women. [Page] I thought "Petrichor" was-- [Mike] "Petrichor" was so cool. [Page] There have been some good ones. -Fish look what you've started. -Some funny stuff. Somewhere along the line, it just exploded into people, you know, the whole... Fucking crazy, man. [Page] It became iconic. [Jon] I just put it on as a joke and Tina said, "You gotta wear that on stage, you look like Barney Rubble." So I did. I wore it for one gig at Nectar's. I wore it for one gig at Nectar' And the next day I came back in my street clothes and Trey goes, "Where's the dress?" And I go, "What do you mean?" He goes, "You can't not wear the dress now, it'll rot the gig." I continued to wear it for the next 35 years. -That's it. That was it. -There was another time -you stopped wearing it. -Well, it was.. I gave you a hard time about it too, I remember. It made me so sad. You took it off, you started wearing-- I started wearing a three piece suit. During that period of time, I kinda became a little... I was sullen, melancholy. -Sullencholy? -Sullen... -Sullen melancholy! -[laughing] [Mike] You were Jon Sullen Melancholy. [laughing] -I could introduce you that way. -Jon Sullen Melancholy. [laughing] Jon Sullen Melancholy. ♪ I started a joke You could give me a fake piano and I could play. ♪ Alone again Jon Sullen Melancholy. [indistinct crosstalk] It's a good balance right now. Like, everybody has the right amount of band and the right amount of space to exist outside of the world of the band. That was kind of a problem before we stopped in 2004, which is when I got kinda mixed up in, like, my personal problems. Like, exploded to drinking too much and that kind of thing. And then, like, I ended up, you know, finally, like, getting arrested. Which was, strangely, was kind of a good thing. [laughs] Because, like, finally, this, like, crazy thing that had been rolling along so insanely, stopped. Everything just stopped, and I didn't talk to anybody. And then, like, about a year after that, the three guys came and visited me, which was, like... I remember that. You know, like, I wasn't allowed to leave, I was, like, sort of under house arrest. And they came and took me out to dinner. That was really nice. And then we started kind of, like, firing back up and we just rebuilt, like, our life from that point on in, like, a much healthier way. ♪ Sitting on the floor [blues music] ♪ Thinking, breathing ♪ Burning ♪ Burning ♪ I'm about to run [blues music] [Trey] I think probably the difference in this album is that there's a lot of moments of real, raw honesty.

I look back on some dark times, and I'm like, "Boy, it seemed rough at the time, but there was a certain excitement, and a certain freedom." And that when it went away, I wasn't sad. But I was like, "I'm never gonna feel like that again." Like you feel alive or something. [Page] Yeah. You were, like, just so alive in every moment. How's the show going? You do what you gotta do. It's not quite... Yeah, I know. It's... Ever since... I haven't even read the book yet, but it's already loosening up. It's already working. You're gonna read the introduction.

I gotta look at that a little bit like, really? Fifteen years? That's all you can take? C'mon, man! Like, I'll never stop. It can be lonely sometimes, and whatever, it is. You know, but who cares?
