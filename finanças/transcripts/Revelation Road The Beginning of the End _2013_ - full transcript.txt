♪♪♪ (male narrator) The end of the age: Some men fear it is a time of destruction, while others welcome it as the ushering in of grace. For ages they tried to warn us of its coming. They told us both to beware and to rejoice. Over time this revelation has been rejected, diluted, ignored by all but a few. And the voices of righteous men have been drowned and silenced beneath a tide of wickedness. Years passed. War begat war. Greed begat greed. And men laughed, secure in their dominion over the earth. Even as the signs began, great floods, fire, famine, pestilence, they laughed, lost in their hubris.

(thug leader) People don't vanish. They're here. I can feel 'em. I will find you. And don't ever question me again. [motorcycle engines] That's impossible. Tell me, do you know your way back to town? Um, yeah, sure. Good. Go there. Stay off the road, and I promise you you'll meet no misfortune. Are you-- I mean, are you him? As you walk, Elizabeth, think on what you've seen today. I don't-- I don't know what I saw. Grandma and Grandpa, they-- What happened to them? What do you think happened? The light came down? It took them? And what is the light? I don't know. God? Why didn't he take me too? Did you ever ask him to? Why are you telling me all this? Why are you trying to help me? I'm nothing special. That's where you're wrong, Elizabeth.

You, Elizabeth... You have a very important part in God's plan. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Never actually asked. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪
