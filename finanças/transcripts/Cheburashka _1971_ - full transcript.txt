Soyuzmultfilm studio (puppet film division) Cheburashka Screenplay - Eduard Uspenskiy, Roman Kachanov Song lyrics - Aleksandr Timofeyevskiy Director Roman Kachanov Art director Leonid Shvartsman Camera operator Teodor Bunimovich Composer - Vladimir Shainski Sound - Georgiy Martynyuk Animators - Maya Buzinova, Natalia Dabizha, Yuriy Norshtein Voices - T. Dmitriyeva, Vasiliy Livanov, Klara Rumyanova, Vladimir Ferapontov Jumping over the puddles, the pedestrians huddle, as the sky lashes out in a storm. And they look, and they wonder -- in this rain, in this thunder, why I'm smiling and singing a song. And I'm playing my garmoshka loud for everyone to hear. What a pity, that a birthday comes just once a year. There will come a magician In a blue helicopter and will throw us a show for free. Then he'll stay for the party, and when he is departing, he'll make candy grow up on the trees. And I'm playing my garmoshka loud for everyone to hear. It's a pity that a birthday comes just once a year. It's a pity that a birthday comes but once a year. Hello. Is this the house of Gena the Crocodile? Yes, this is where he lives. It's me. Then please sign this. - Hello, Gena! - Hello! I wish you a happy birthday. Thank you! Is this for me? Yes. Cheburashka, you're a true friend! Scouts... Scouts. Real scouts... Ah, I'd love to be able to march like that. March? To become a scout, you have to do a lot of good deeds. Understand? I understand... Wow, it's very pretty. Very. Want to launch it? Okay. One... Two... - Three! - Hang on, let me! - Hold on to this. - Okay. Hold tight, now. - Like that? - Like that! Chaburashka! Hold on! Cheburashka! Did you get hurt? No. Not even a tiny bit. Phew. I was so worried for you! Scouts again. Gena... Let's ask if we can join. No, Cheburashka, they won't take us. Why not? Maybe they will. Come on, let's try! All right, let's try! - Hello. - Hello! Will you let us join you? You? Join our scout troop? No way. Though you could join as pets. We don't want to be pets! We want to be scouts! - Do you know how to make bird houses? - No, we don't. - Ever had to set up a campfire? - No, never. - Perhaps you know how to march? - No idea. See. You guys are not ready yet. Besides. Being scouts is only for the best of the best! But... we will become the best of the best! Great. Do come back then. Bah. It's no use. Don't worry, Gena. We'll take a break and then try to fix it one more time. You could have hurt yourself! When I was a young crocodile, I never climbed fire escapes. - Good thing we got here in time! - I won't do it again, promise! All right, then. Be careful. Why, why on earth did you do that! Have you got nothing better to do? No. We have nothing to do! They have nowhere to play. That's why they go where they shouldn't. Okay, we'll help them. - What's in that little house? - Nothing. We'll get rid of all this stuff. Here, we'll put a bench, and over here a window. And it'll be a little house. Where they can play. Hurrah and huzzah! [Danger!] No. Let's not build anything there. And for Cheburashka's birthday ... ... we baked bread with caraway ... ... it was tall like so ... ... it was low like so ... ... it was wide like so ... Wow, that's a lot of firewood. Are we going to build a campfire? Nope, we're going to build a playground for little kids. Here, play some see-saw for now. Hey, you guys need any help? Thanks, but you guys are already busy. Oh, come on, let me have a go! No way! You might let go of the jackhammer. Now they definitely won't let us join. Citizen Crocodile? Wh... what? That's you who stole the compressor? Yes, it was me who stole it. And how were you planning to use it? We, uh... We already used it. We built a playground for little kids. Hah, good job! Don't worry about the compressor. I'll return it myself. - Good bye! - Cheers, guys! Rus-ted pot or bro-ken ket-tle? We re-cyc-le your scrap metal! Cheburashka! I know this one place, there's tons of scrap metal there! Oh dear. Looks like I'll have to dive to get him. But I have no idea how to swim! Cheburashka! Don't just stand there! - What? - Give me a hand! - Come on! - Pull! - Bring it over. - Hurrah! Here. We got this for you. We wanted to help you out. Hurrah! The first place is ours! - We're very happy for you! - Bye now. Wait! We accept you in our troop! Us? In your troop? But we don't know how to march or how to make bird houses. That's not important. You did so many other good deeds! And we'll teach you how to march! Troop line up! Attention! March forward!

It's quite nice! - Gena. - Hm? Is it very heavy for you to carry our things? How can I explain it, Cheburashka? They're very heavy. Listen, Gena, let me carry those things and you can carry me. This is a great idea! Laaa-dee-daa... passing through the green... Oh! A suitcase! I can use this... Very nice. Now, ahead!

I'm the first to the river! So that's how it is!! The river will be clean! Hooray!! Guys! The bell! Something got caught!! Hide!! Probably sturgeon! Why don't you want a crocodile? Help! Run for your life!! Lariska! Track them down and capture them! Here is a gift for you! Hmm! But this is a little frog! But he is green! Thank you... However... We should let him go. Let him jump around. Sorry kids, but there is nothing we can give you as a gift. You don't need to. You already gave us a clean river! So, so askew... Old Lady Shapoklyak is riding along in the handcar... Take your cake! It's fresh! Thank you! Gena! Your things! Hello Cheburashka! Hello! Hey look! A bird! Where? It flew away. Cake! Stand straight! Straighten up your clothes! What is that rope? - Mother!! - We won't do that again! - Whose idea was this? - Whose? Whose?! Mine! You are so dumb, Petya! Here's your money and your tickets. Take them. Thank you. Do you have a ticket? There's no need. I can travel on the roof. No! No! No! You will travel in a compartment together with Cheburashka. Cheburashka is a little one and you are still a Lady. A Lady?! Thank you, Gena. Oh, crocodile! Gena, I will sit with you! Thank you, Cheburashka. Nice little guy! He couldn't leave his friend. Scoot over. Crocodile, play! Slowly minutes are floating away Don't expect to see them again And maybe we feel sad that our past is gone All the best is ahead of us Smoothly, smoothly the long path spreads ahead of us And runs straight into horizon Everyone should believe and hope for the best And our blue train is streaming ahead Maybe we have hurt someone unintentionally The calendar will turn that page for us And let's rush to move on to new adventures Let's ask the driver to speed it up Smoothly, smoothly the long path spreads ahead of us And runs straight into horizon Everyone should believe and hope for the best And our blue train is streaming ahead Our blue train is streaming and swaying This express train is really speeding up Why does this day have to come to an end? I wish it could last a whole year Smoothly, smoothly the long path spreads ahead of us And runs straight into horizon Everyone should believe and hope for the best And our blue train is streaming ahead Written by: E.

[Repair] I don't understand any of this. Hello, Gena! Hello, hello, Cheburashka. Why didn't you meet me? Uh, I didn't know you were coming. Did you receive my telegram? I certainly did. Here is your telegram. Wait a moment... Try switching these. You are great! Look! The telegram is very beautiful! Have you read it? No, I was waiting for you to come and read it to me. Does this means you can't read, Cheburashka?! No I can't, Gena. But you are lucky, Cheburashka. Tomorrow is the first of September! So what? So that means, Cheburashka, that tomorrow is the start of a new school year. You will go to school and study there. Do you understand? I understand, and this is so wonderful!! That's an idea. I will go to school, as well. It's decided! I'm starting a new life! And when I graduate I will go to the zoo. I will work as your substitute. No, Cheburashka, no. No way! You can't work there. - Why? - Because they'll eat you, that's why! Look! We forgot about the uniform! What should we do? [Sign: Young Students] We will buy everything we need in this store.

Hello, hello. Could I speak to the school principal? Hello, I'm the principal. I'm Vyera. I'm in charge of the critter corner. This is a turtle and a crow.
