I only looked for a second. - The wig there. The dog stole my wig, see. - Ow, stop. We followed it here. We only want the wig. Your dog stole it. Our dog is not a thief. You were trying to steal him, weren't you? But now you're acting innocent. You thief! Who is this boy? Did you kidnap him? Eh? Hey, little boy, is that guy trying to kidnap you? - Don't be afraid. You can tell me. - No. No. - What's he saying? - Nein. He's my nephew, ma'am. From Germany. - He's my brother's son. - Y-yes. Your dog showed up and stole the wig. So we chased it all the way back here. All the way from the beach. I'm not lying to you! Really, I swear, I'm not a thief. So enough of your funny talk. Well that's it! You haven't even heard funny talk yet! Just wait, I'll show you real funny, huh? Could you knock it off? The gentleman said he wasn't robbing us! Gentleman? Thank you.

It's clean and good as new. - Here you go. - Did you wash it well, Arzu? Yes, I shampooed the wig and made sure that it was spotless. Why don't you put it on? Let's see it. I'll wait till later to put the wig on. I need to treat it with ointment first. So that thick hair is thanks to your ointment, very good! I don't know why you wear that, Cengiz. You're already cute as a button. You know how it is, performing, nightlife. All of those things. Hey, Mom, wouldn't it be great if they could just go and plant hair the way they do in the fields, right? Yeah, then we might as well grow corn on his sideburns. Look, he's got the ball. There he goes. It's going to be legendary if he can make this one! Let's go! Come on. Goal! Goal! Wow. He's incredible. Why do you care so much? Are we Argentinean now? Maradona's a legend. - We can't help it if we love him, Mom. - Hmm. Well, thank you for everything today. But we should really get going. Sit down, sit down. Let's eat together. - Zeliha. - What? Would you open a bottle? I'm feeling great today. Wouldn't you know it! - You can't drink this early. Come on. - Yes, I can! Zeliha! Sevda. Come on in. Hey, Sevda, say hi. Good to see you all. Hey, Mr. Şerafettin. I'm here with some good news that I wanted to tell you. - What do you want? - Well, Mrs. Suna saw Arzu and she was quite taken with her. She'd like to visit and ask her hand, for her youngest son. - For the doctor? - Mm-hmm. We're not doing it. Go tell her politely, "no way." So, I politely say "no way" to her? Yeah! Just tell her no, but do it politely. Go on. How have you been, Arzu? Go and give her a kiss. Taşkın, dear, how are you? - Hello, sir. - Hi. Oh, my gosh. I know exactly who you are. At the beach. You play music there, don't you? You mean you knew who I was like this? Yes. Like I said, everyone knows Cengiz. So, what are you all up to? They said they want to drink. We'll get the table ready.

He's just like Cengiz Kurtoğlu, - don't you think? - I suppose that's my misfortune. Your style sounds familiar. Do you always sing like this? Yes, it's my personal style of singing. It's a gift from God. But sometimes, others get a head start, you know? So I'm not the one copying. You're really just as good as Cengiz Kurtoğlu, I think. Get that wig on, and no one would even know the difference. - I'm saving to make a record right now. - Yeah? - You're releasing a record? - Yes, madam. It's a dream of mine to make one. I plan to record a demo in Bursa, and I will take that record to Istanbul, and try to make it big, God willing. You're going to need a brand new song to make your debut, Cengiz. - Huh? - The thing about the songs that you sing, everyone has heard those a million times now. You won't have much luck. And it'll cost a ton. Why don't you try for something that's a little more fierce and lively? With a song like "The Girl from Bursa." It's our dad's new song. - I'd love to hear it. - We'll play it for you. Şerafettin, go and get your lute. Come on! Well, all right then.

My God. It's late. Where were you? We've been so worried. Where have you been? Özcan, come here. Sit down. We visit one month a year, but somehow you always find some way to cause issues for us! But we missed the bus on the way back, Papa. - And a melon truck had to take us. - What? Anyway, the two of you are safe and sound, thank Allah for that. Anyways, I've got some news. Really great news. It's been an incredible day, and I can't wait to tell you the great news. So go on. What's the news about? In Mudanya, we spent our day with the famous songwriter, Şerafettin Neşe today, yippee! And we're doing a record! Oh, come on. You've been saying that forever, man. And the album just never comes out. It's happening for real. I've really hit the jackpot, you know? This time it's different. He's got this beautiful song. And it just won't get out of my head. Listen, if I got this song, it would sell three million copies, and it would only take a month or so, I swear. - Really? - Really. Hey, Brother, would it be all right if we talked in private? - Nein! It's money he's asking for. - Ayhan… …no. Please! Oh, my sweet sister, please. All right, fine, I was going to ask for money. Because sadly, you need money so you can make money. You think that I have been working in Germany so that I can fund your record? You're an idiot! Don't say that, Brother. You say that I'm an idiot in front of the kid like that? That's harsh. That's… that was uncalled-for. I feel horrible now. I'm sure you don't think a thousand marks is a lot of money, but it's a game changer for me. I guess I'll just take this blow and bottle it away. Look how I ended up, man. I go around wearing this wig, and you can comb that every day. Your gorgeous hair. Not all of us are blessed in life. Oh, don't cry. Come on. Oh, come on. Don't be like that. Would you just stop it? No more crying, all right? We'll work it out, okay? - You really mean it? - No! - Yes! - Please. - Are you for real right now? - Of course! We'll figure it out. We will. Oh. Sardines on the cart! Erol, Erol, Erol, Erol, Erol! Hey, girl. Let me kiss you. Hmm, I think I'm going to pass. Come on, honey. Just a peck on the cheek, huh? Have you lost your mind? What will the neighbors say? Leave me alone, for God's sake. Hey, listen, I brought you some fish. Fish in the morning? What am I, a cat? And everyone at home will ask why you were here, Erol. Get your fresh mackerel off the cart! You're making my heart burn even brighter. Don't act weird. Morning, Pakize. - Good morning, Erol. - Uh, should I get some fish, bro? What's up with him? He's going to release a record. Peddler's here! Oscar. Oscar. Is that a wig over there? Run! Get it, boy. Get it. Run! Idiot dog. Taşkın? Taşkın? Taşkın! Taşkın! Oh, Mr. Cengiz, you scared me. What's happening? Uh, Arzu. Hello. I'm sorry. The door was open. I was looking for Taşkın. Very sorry if I scared you. I didn't mean to. It's okay. - Please sit. - No, I wouldn't want to bother you. Uh, is Taşkın home? No. Everyone is out right now. Mom went to the market. And my brother and dad are with Doctor Fatih. Doctor? Is everything all right? Oh, no, they're fine! They're with the singer Doctor Fatih. - With the Doctor Fatih? - Yes! He wanted to get a song from my dad. So they went to the studio to sign a deal. I brought this for you. - For me? - Candied chestnuts. Good for energy. Aw, thank you. And your hair is looking suave today. - Yeah? - Yeah. Thank you. I'll see you later. Thanks.

Adnan? - Hello, everyone. - Oh, Cengiz! What a nice surprise. Hello, everyone. Hello, Turgay. Hello. Let me kiss your hand, sir. Hello. How are you? Oh. How are you, Cengiz? I'm doing well, Doctor Fatih. How are you? Fine. How's playing? Still over at the tea garden? For now, yeah. Um, for now? Are you still making a record, Cengiz? He's been making one for years now. Tell you what. Release it, I promise I'll buy a hundred of your records. He had more hair when he started. He's obsessed. But you're looking handsome. You've lost some weight. Three kilos? Two? - Seven! - Aha! Seven? Well done. Impressive. Lose another 50, and you'll be like Freddie Mercury. He's a good boy. I like him fine. All right then. Come on. Cengiz, come on. Don't just stand there. Take a seat. Sure, of course. Yes. All right. Now that we've got the song, let's do the paperwork. Right, Fatih? Is the song from yesterday? The song I'm making into a hit. - How much are you asking for it? - We're asking for a hundred grand. I'll give you 300. I have it on me right now. Dad. Hey, Dad. Cengiz wants to give us 300. What? What's that? Who wants to pay 300? - I want to! - Huh? I'm willing to pay 300, Mr. Şerafettin. And I'd like the song to be mine. And Turgay could record it. In the studio! The demo and recording, you could write me up a quote for that. Let's get this song recorded! Whoa! Slow it down. Who do you think you are? Listen to that cunning serpent. What a devil he is! You are a fat snake! It's my song. You can't just barge in and take it! - Hmm? - We agreed on a hundred already, - didn't we, hmm? - Listen to me, Doctor Fatih. - I will make you eat those words. - Oh! A fat snake? For my mother's sake and because we're unfortunately related, I'll hold myself back. You've always been awful. Back in school, in the military, when I proposed to that girl. What kind of curse is this? You stalking me? You scorpion! - Wait, you two are related? - Distantly! I renounce you as a relative! So distant, we're hardly even related. He's like the son of an aunt's sister-in-law's daughter. Something like that. No one really knows how we're related! You really are a shameless monkey. We were having an important meeting, and that's when you crudely interrupted us. Can you believe it? All of this slander. I'm not the one who's at fault for all of his failures. No, I'm not. I am literally shaking, I'm so upset! Now let's get back to it. I told you I want this song. And we agreed on a hundred grand. Now it's 300? - Fatih! - Back off! Taşkın, you gave us your word, remember? Hold on. Sir, just don't let this man come between us. I am offering you my lifelong savings here, sir. Sir, I beg of you, don't listen to that awful man. It's perfect for me, this song. Ah, can you believe that Little Emrah? - Oh, no! Dad's having a heart attack. - No, no! - Şerafettin! - What do we do? - What's wrong? - Doctor Fatih, help us! - Don't look. - But I'm only a doctor of music. - Hurry! Call for an ambulance right now. - Ambulance, ambulance! Call an ambulance! - Oh, my goodness! - Look away, Fatih! Şerafettin? It was gas. Oh, thank Allah it wasn't his heart. I'm so grateful. - Oh, Şerafettin. - Huh? Lift those legs up, dear. Put these under your dad's feet, okay? - Lift them up, Papa. - Yes, lift them up. Relieve yourself. We're not strangers. You've got no need to be shy. - Just do it. - Hey, Papa. Should we leave you alone so you can fart without us watching you? I'm all right. The pills helped with the gas. Oh, good. - Thank God. Also… - What? It may not be the best time, but Rukiye the matchmaker is waiting outside. Hmm. It's about Mr. Salih, the bathhouse owner's son. - And? - They want to ask if Arzu would marry him. Which son is out there? The one who's an engineer. Real cute. The one with the pale blue eyes. Oh. No. No can do. Would you politely go tell them we're not giving her? Well, how is it that I can politely reject them like that? Well, tell them I'm in here dying. Tell her I've got one foot in the grave already. - That's a bit much. - Tell her that we want an astronaut! No doctors or engineers. We got plenty of those in our family already. - Ridiculous! - You know, Dad's right. We really do need an astronaut. - Stop it. - Just look at him. What a monkey. Like we sent him to space and he came back stupid. You tell them that. We've got space monkeys already! This really is a bad time for us. Go tell her politely to leave us alone. - All right. - Geez. - Papa? - What? Cengiz is here to give you his good wishes. Should I let him in? No! I'm not well. It's all his fault! That bald loser. - All right, I'll send him away right now. - Get him outta here. This is it. It's going to come. Let it rip, Papa. Here it comes! Come on, let that fart out! Oh, Taşkın, hello. Is he doing all right? Yeah, thanks. Dad is doing much better. He wanted to say hello to you, but the doctor said that he couldn't. Oh. Well that's wonderful news. All right, I'll say hi later then. I'm just glad he's okay. And it's all because of that no-good Doctor Fatih. Look at what he did to him. We already shook on it, and he couldn't handle the song being mine. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I wore him out. Now I bet he'll never sell it to him. I sure wouldn't. You know, if I were him, I wouldn't sell it. After that, he wouldn't, right? Do you think he would? - Would he? No, he wouldn't. - I have no idea. It was as good as done. And you're like a brother to me. I spent all day walking around with this money in my pocket. Just look at all this money. I guess it doesn't matter. The song is all yours, bud. - Hmm? - I spoke to my dad just a minute ago. He feels the only one who could do it justice is you. He sensed ulterior motives from the other guy. Wait. Are you for real? Here's what we'll do. I'll just take that off your hands right now and hold on to it. When my dad is feeling better, I'll hand it to him right away, okay? I'll keep you posted. You shouldn't carry this on you. You never know who's around. You know, I really feel it was meant to be this way, Cengiz. Then let's hope it all goes well. Gee, I feel great. I'm so excited right now. - Me too. I'm very excited now, man. - Oh, gosh. Taşkın? Hey, Mom wants you. Hello, Arzu. - Hi, good evening. - Good evening. - This is for your dad. It's dessert. - Thanks. Guess I'll head out then! Oh, gosh. We got the song. Cengiz, you got the song.

You as well. You're always the winner, man. It's Maradona again? Of course it is! He's always a winner. Gotta respect the king. I'll buy the king for 50,000. Just 50? Even if you sold your store, you wouldn't have enough for this guy. He's worth too much. Don't you try to lowball me. You're pissing me off. Okay, fine. Don't get all mad about it. Fifty, my ass! I can't believe that bastard would ask for that. This is Maradona, dude. Now… "CANARIES SINGING LIKE NIGHTINGALES" CONTEST …we present to you last year's champion, Taşkın Neşe's bird. A Maltese Gloster crossbreed. A canary called Maradona. Three years old, purebred. All right. Here it goes. ♪ Lay me down on the hillside ♪ ♪ Scratch me up, scratch me down ♪ ♪ Lay me down on the hillside Scratch me up, scratch me down ♪ Well done. Very good. Well done. Maradona's opening bid will come in at 100,000. Open at a hundred. Any higher? A hundred ten! I got 110, 110. Anyone else here? Anyone higher? 110! 110! Taşkın, you okay with that price? No. I'll keep him. All right then. Take your bird away then. Okay, and next up is our final competitor. It belongs to One-Armed Kemal, who is competing for the first time. This canary here is a one-year-old Parisian. He is called Zeki Pasha. Dear God. This one's like a wrestler. My bird fell over! I need a vet. My bird is dead! Maradona. Maradona. Maradona. Well, then I guess we have a winner. We have a winner. There we go. We open for Zeki Pasha at 200 grand. Do I hear 200? - 200. Anyone bidding higher? - 220! I have 220 from Ramazan. Any other bidders? - 250. - That's 250 from Taşkın. Going for 250. Going, going... 280. We got 280! Yes, going to Ramazan for 280. Going to Ramazan for 280. Going once. Twice. And... - 300! - No way! Going to Taşkın for 300. Any other bidders? Going once. Going twice. Sold! To the man with 300 grand! Taşkın is the winner. There you go. Fuck your tweeting! That's enough! Enough. You'll make yourself sick again. Shut up, woman. Be quiet! Looks like we raised a thief for a son. Don't say that, Papa. It hurts my feelings. Why sell it for a hundred when you can sell it for 300? Every song has its price. You and your bird deals! I've had enough of your nonsense. Don't make me hit you, idiot, or they'll be scraping you off the floor. Your word is your bond! "Every song has its price." The money is gone. It's all flown away. You stupid idiot. Well, can we not just go and give Zeki Pasha back to them? Oh, I guess we can't. - Hello, ma'am. You here for the girl? - Hello. Yes, we are. They won't give her. They won't for anyone. Don't bother. - Have a good day. - Well, then let's go. It was worth a try. I'm very sorry. Taşkın! Cengiz, what's up? Thanks. So let me get the story straight here. Taşkın here has a bird addiction? Uh… It's an issue, you know. He loves birds. Hmm. So, when Maradona died, he went and purchased Zeki Pasha to ease his pain? Yes. - And he used my money to buy the bird? - Uh, that's right. So then Zeki Pasha is the one you sold the song to. Taşkın, do you have any idea what you've done to me? What do I tell my brother? How is this possible? In Germany he works a whole month to earn that kind of money. What do I say? Maradona's dead, long live Zeki Pasha? And you gave me your word last night. Remember? When you said the song was mine. I believed you, Taşkın. I even quit my job. And now I'm ruined, brother! - Did you tell him him that? - What an idiot! Hear that? He lost his job too. Be quiet, everyone. Be quiet. Now, son. We're very sorry. But we gave our word. And so we have to give our song to Doctor Fatih. For free, if necessary. But we need to compensate you for your loss somehow. You lost your job over it. What can we do? - Papa. - Huh? I heard that at Mr. Metin's club, he needs an opener. So? I don't have a band. It's just me. - Papa. - No! Don't start up again. Oh, can't we do it, please? This will be good. I can feel it! Şeref, come on. And I'll be there the whole time, watching her. - Okay, fine. - Yes! Oh, my God. But on one condition. You need to sell Zeki Pasha immediately and give all the money to Cengiz right away. Uh, can't we wait until we get chicks, Pop? Shut up! - Okay. I will. - Shh. What's going on? You've got a band. Dad made us a group. Me, you and her. - What about my record though? - Sooner rather than later, I guess. Man, life is full of surprises. You never know what the future holds. Are you hungry? - I am. - Let's eat! Huh. ♪ I love you, I love you Do you love me? Yes I do ♪ ♪ I love you, I love you Do you love me?

It's Italian, okay? It's Italian, mmm. I like that grasshopper design on the back. What are you saying? There's no grasshopper, hmm? - It's on your back. - Hmm? Oh, what is that? Oh, it's a real one. Oh, my God, get it! Adnan! Adnan! Metin, get it off! Come on, it's only a grasshopper. It'll jump away eventually. Or it could be here forever! Look at it. It's got eyes and everything. Get it off. - All right, just don't move. - Kill it! - Where is it? - Huh? - Where is it? - Hey, don't step on it! Where is it? Where? Is it still on me? Oh, my God! - Hold still, I just spotted it. - Oh, my God. Is it on me? Oh! Oh, God, no. Adnan. - Where is it? - Oh, it looks like I missed it. - Here, hold still. Don't move. - I want it dead! What's going on? Fatih's afraid of bugs. The grasshopper's gone. It's all good now. They're the devil. Come on, Pasha, sing. Come on. He won't sing. I wonder if they drugged the bird. What? Drug it? How would they even do that? Shh. Just be quiet. Listen. I know you can do it. One tweet is all. No. It's not worth it. Fifty grand is all I'll give. And that's just because I saw the bird. Are you mad? How dare you. Fuck right off! I heard you offer 280 a few days ago. Well, that was before I knew it was drugged. Where do they put the drugs? - On its dick. - Birds have dicks? I said bring it over, and if it sings, I'll consider it. So that's how it is. Hmm. Hmm. That's how it is, Taşkın. I swear, if that guy actually drugged the bird… - He wouldn't sing for you? - No, he wouldn't. Hmm. I see you told everyone, Taşkın. So what of it? So, now what are we doing? Oh, would you shut up? I'm already stressed enough. Oh, you're stressed? Are you serious? How can you say that? My whole career is hanging off the dick of a canary right now! What do I tell my brother? He'll never believe me. "We spent the money on a canary, and unfortunately they drugged its dick, and all the money's gone, but we have a new bird." Seriously, Taşkın, really? All right, I hear you, man. Enough, okay? If you've got a trust issue, then go ahead and keep the bird yourself. You can't just chase a thief to his home, right? And why can't we? I want to get my money back. Your money is right in front of you. As soon as the bird sings for us. It's an animal. What, do you want me to sing instead? I'll tell you right now what we should do. Let's go find the guy, grab him by his neck, and force him to give us compensation for all this. I want my money, let's go find him. All right. You first. The Minister has responded to claims that radiation levels in tea are dangerous following the explosion at Chernobyl. The following is his response. He stated, "Look, I'm drinking tea. Would I if it were dangerous? No, I wouldn't." That will conclude our news for today. Signing off for now. But be sure to stay tuned. Up next we have the weather report for tomorrow coming your way. - What's up, Tahir? - Oh. Taşkın, how's it going? We're looking for the One-Armed guy who sold me the bird. Oh. He went to his hometown. - Ah, shit. - Well, there you go. Wait just a minute. I heard about this expert guy that knows about the drugs. The bird needs to get checked. What was the guy's name? Uh, well, Sleek Hüsnü. - Uh-huh. Do you know where he is? - I'll get his telephone number, okay? You're speaking to him. Uh-huh. Okay, bring the bird over to me, and I'll take a look for you. Sure, that's fine. I'll meet you in front of the bathhouse, okay? The bathhouse. All right, we're heading over. How will we find him in a bathhouse? - He said in front of it! - Ask how we'll know who he is. Uh, how will we recognize who you are, Sleek Hüsnü? Hüsnü is fine on its own. And I don't know who gave me that nickname. I'll be right there, and I'm wearing a brown suit jacket. Okay, we're on our way, uh, Mr. Just Hüsnü. He said that his jacket is brown. Bathhouse? - See you, Tahir. - Right. See you later. - So, it's this bathhouse? - Yeah. In front of it. - I'm the mayor. - Ah, there he is. In the brown jacket. No, I'm the mayor of this town. How are you, Mr. Sleek Hüsnü? We talked to you on the phone. Our bird isn't doing well. Cengiz? You know you said you'd wait outside the bathhouse? And so we came for you! - You came for me? - Yeah, so we could talk. - What is that? - He's covered in urine. Where's this Sleek Hüsnü going? There's nothing sleek about the guy. He's covered in feces. - What do you mean? - Look at him, man. Pssh. Just look at him, all right? What? He's crazy. He's insane. Hi, gentlemen. I'm Hüsnü. Is this our patient here? Madman! He's gone crazy! He stole my knife, look out! - He's after us. Hurry up! Let's go. - Mr. Sleek, run! He's getting away. - Oh, God. Help! - I'm the mayor. - They're here for me. - Oh, Melon man. Oh, God! - I'm the mayor! - Oh, fuck! What is this? I'm the mayor. - Oh, God, Mr. Mayor. I'm innocent! - Come here! Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor! Sir, hold on one second. Oh, shoot! - Keep the bird steady. - I'm the mayor! I'm the mayor! I'm the mayor! Hey! Get rid of that knife right now! He's got some balls, hasn't he? Hey! Give me the wig back, damn it! Hand me the wig! Ugh. Now he's wearing it. Psst, here's your stupid wig. I lost my wig again. I'm just glad he didn't carve us up and dunk us into that yogurt! I got that one in Istanbul. Where will I get one? - We won't find one before the show. - We'll find a way. Oh, hey. It looks really good on you. Don't be ridiculous. I look like I'm a German football player or something. This isn't me. I look like I'm Devran. Don't I look like Devran? It's Devran. ♪ I've been squirming in pain ♪ ♪ Anger takes hold of your heart... ♪ I don't want to be him, man. Please, Ms. Sevda.

I think this one looks really good, honestly. It's a good change. Don't you agree, Arzu? It looks great. And on top of that, - you look younger, Cengiz. - Really? - Sevda, don't you think he looks amazing? - He looks fantastic. Look at how handsome he looks! And all this beautiful hair. It's got style and attitude, right? - It's so flamboyant. - Huh? Are you for real? It's full of style and attitude and all of that stuff? Let's just say this. I think with your new, young look, you need a new stage name. - A stage name? - Mmm. I've got it! The Nightingale of Bursa. The Nightingale of Bursa, Cengiz. Oh, my gosh, I love it! It's the best. Huh? Zeki Müren is The nightingale of Bursa. First, Zeki Müren, the one and only, he touches hearts all over. Two, Müzeyyen Senar. She's the queen of Bursa and she's the master of them all. Third, Bülent Ersoy. A glittering star. A diamond amongst the singers. She will tear your heart out. They're like the magical birds of a forest. So why shouldn't you be the nightingale? They haven't got one. The Nightingale of Bursa. Just sing like yourself. Your nightingale is here. It's not here. Hmm. The Nightingale of Bursa! You're no nightingale. You're the Parrot of Bursa! You're an idiot, Cengiz. All these years, all you've done is imitate others. And now you have to find your own voice, you parrot! Look, it's the Parrot of Bursa. Polly want a cracker? Hi, birdie. Some nightingale! You'll make a fool of yourself. They'll laugh their asses off at you. You've got fake hair, fake voice, and now they call you the Nightingale. Some nightingale. I am having a nervous breakdown. Oh, Arzu. It sounded so good when you said it. I believed it for a minute. Your nightingale is here. It's not here. Huh? Oh, good. I'm losing my mind. Why not think of her when I sing? I'm in love with her, after all. Yes, I admit it. I love her. I'm a man in love. So then. I'll think of her.

I am just so proud of you, my baby! Now sit down and eat, my prince. Last night, you were just amazing. Wonderful, my talented son. Thank you, Mommy. Oh, the girl's voice. She was one hell of a singer too. Yes, she is. Great voice. And we sound so good with each other. Yeah, um... And how's it going with your album, Cengiz? Uh, we're working on it. - Going ahead at full speed. - How many songs have you got? - I haven't gotten one yet. - Huh? What I mean is, there's one I haven't got. I got a discount. I got the rest of them already. A good bargain price. So I agreed to get all of them. Except one. Okay. Is all of that including the studio fees too? They're integrated. It's inclusive, you know? All in one. You used all the money. Well, yes. The money is gone. Really? You're just like when you were little. I know how you are. Oh, Cengiz! You know, when he was still a kid, he used to lie to us sometimes for three months and surprise us. So when he tells us he's working on it… You're just going to suddenly drop it on us, right? That's it. You're going to surprise us with it, aren't you? Uh… Yes, of course. A surprise. A surprise. Morning, Auntie Remziye. This guy said he was here for Cengiz. May we come in? - Hüs... Hüsnü. What is it? - Good morning. Hello to you all. - Cengiz, your bird. Take it. - Hmm? Here. I tried all sorts of things, but the bird refuses to sing. It's a shame because I know you paid a lot of money for it. And he won't sing. How much was he? And what bird? Cengiz, did he say it was your bird? Yes. He said that Cengiz's bird won't sing. Well, the thing is, it's, uh... But if there's one thing I can assure you of, that One-Armed Man won't be doing any business here again. All the bird enthusiasts know about this incident. Oh, what he's saying is, uh... A story like that is the talk of the town. After all, it's not every day someone loses 300 grand on a bird. That's headline news. - Oh, it's 300 grand? - I'm dead. Is that the same 300 grand we all know about, Cengiz? Wait, let me explain it. So what happened was... Predictable! I was just saying that he was going to surprise us. Oh! Oh, jacket! Uh, not the jacket! What are you doing? Take me to the bathhouse. Take me now. Get me out and take me to the bathhouse. It's too gross, I can't do it. Mom, help him out.

Whenever I trust you, I end up screwed in the end. Wow. Your attitude is just poisonous today! It only hurts if it's true. We're all trying to make money here. What about all that we earned together last night? Who is this? Where's the Cengiz that I would call a brother? If I had 300 more, you'd steal it for a bird! Cengiz, you're hurting my feelings now. You're breaking my heart. Oh, yes, great. You're the victim. Oh, look! Your friends are all here! Mr. Bird! Hello, Birdie! You know this man? It's the birdman. He loves you guys. He'll spend a fortune on you. Come on down, and we'll make it rain for you! Is that how you do it? Knock it off. What are you doing, man? - Get over here. - Stop it. Come on down here. Here! Here, you stupid fucking foo... What are you doing? You're making a scene. Come on, you fucking stupid bird... Would you stop it already? You're embarrassing us, Cengiz. - Come on. - Cengiz, knock it off. - Don't stop me! - Don't worry, - he's rehearsing for a wedding. - Yeah, we're rehearsing. - We're making birds rich. - Just a fun thing he's trying out - to see if it'll work. Stop it now! - You there, hey! Enjoy the money, you dumb birds! If you don't knock it off, then someone is going to call the police on us, got that? - All right, so calm down. - All right. Let go of me. Now. I'm okay. I know you are. You're just angry because you saw us recording with Fatih. But it was just a one-off. He asked if I would do it and I said yes because it's my Dad's song. What could I say? I don't want you to see that man. Tell me why you're talking like that. You're acting as if I slept with the guy. And I'm keeping the bird, you got that? Fine, keep him. But I heard that there's a vet called Şükrü over at the zoo. I heard he works wonders on birds. I have a feeling he's the answer to all this, Cengiz. Hmm. Get up then. Now pick up the money. Go.

Well, thank you. Hello, Mr. Nuri. Hello, Emrah. Nice to see you. We've got an amazing lineup for the show. Just wonderful! Thank you, Mr. Nuri. But... The overture? Who's the opener? Uh, the opening act. It's so important for us. They prep the audience for us. It will affect everyone. I can't be on first. Or the songs won't feel emotional. We'll be sorry. It'll destroy us. Hold on, Emrah. There's no need turn this into a tragedy. Nuri. Enough. Sir. Mr. Osman. I asked about the girl. Her father is the famous Şerafettin Neşe. He used to play with the likes of Zeki Müren. He's an old heavy hitter. The kanoon player's her brother. The other guy is just her bandmate, you know. The Nightingale. And well… - Then what? - She's still single. Oh, no need to take it there. That's of no consequence. Oh, I thought when you asked about the girl, it was because... Nuri, that's enough now. Really, I swear. I was thinking though, what if we got them to be our openers for the show? Oh, but we promised Doctor Fatih. You said so! Doctor Fatih. That's right, I forgot. I already asked the guy. It's a done deal. I'm sorry. But the girl is a great singer. Yeah, she really is. As a matter of fact, the guy is good too. Life isn't fair at all, Mr. Nuri. It'll be all right, okay? I promise. Some luck we've got. Şükrü the vet is on annual leave. Cengiz, you with me? When I look over at that animal there, I can see myself. - Ah. Which one? - That one. The crane. No, it's a sea horse. That's a pelican. Eh, same thing. Life really is unfair, Taşkın. While all of his friends get to soar freely in the skies, this one here is trapped in a cage. Just so he can entertain people.

Really, you've touched this little heart of mine, Cengiz. Oh, Şeref. He's really something! It needs work. It's a good start but it's not complete. - Right. The next verse. - That's not what I mean. Listen up. Where it is now, it sounds like it's for the bird. You need to translate it. No, don't say that. Come on. The "Ode to the Nightingale" was written for a bird, wasn't it? Right! That was for a nightingale. You can't write an ode for a pelican. You ignoramus. In divan poetry, nightingales and cranes stand for love. Divine love, in fact. You might as well write an ode for a seagull, why don't ya? That's a bird. Birdbrain. There's also ducks. The green-winged duck. It dives. Right, sorry. What should I do? No. What my Dad is saying, is that if you're the pelican here, don't write it as if you were an animal. Write as if that pelican were you. Base it on your own life. How can I write another verse? I only spent a second with that damn bird. Captivity, cages, sea, possibly some fish. What do I write about? First a nightingale, now a pelican? Just do it like a human. You got it. Hey, so Cengiz.

You're asking about money? You have the legendary Bülent Ersoy asking for your song, and you're asking about money. I'm sorry, the song's not for sale. - What? - The record. I really want to make a record. I want to be the first to record it. So you guys are making a record together then? Yes! We've become very popular. We get surrounded on the streets. You know Şerafettin Neşe, the songwriter? That's my father. We'll have a few songs of his to record. I wish the bird would song though. If only it sang, you know? - What's he saying? - He's talking about a canary. Zeki Pasha. - Are the two of you completely insane? - Hmm? Are you kidding me right now? What is wrong with you? You're making my brain implode, I swear. Now listen. This is my final offer. Give the song to Ms. Bülent. You get a couple of songs from your dad. I'll find you more songs. We'll record the album in here. And I'll cover all your expenses. I give you until tomorrow morning. Sleep on it and make your decision. Hmm. Go. I'm sorry, have you lost your mind? It's an opportunity. Yeah. Arzu is right. After all, Bülent Ersoy wants your song. And also, record the record on top of that. Cengiz, we'll have an album. Give her the song. See? She agrees with me, Cengiz. He refuses to listen to me. He's been ignoring everything I've said all day. He says he can't. He doesn't care about us. Well, I guess he wants to record the album alone. That's not fair. I never said that. You're just twisting my words up. The offer just really caught me off guard, is all. Is that how you feel? You don't care about the band, huh? So the two of us aren't really important then? Shame on you. - No, Arzu. That isn't what I... - All right, fine. You go and make your own record, - and the two of us will buy it, eh? - Yeah. - We'll just buy it. No big deal. - Of course we will. We will. Actually, I have no doubts that we would succeed together as a group. But... But? What if I find I can't write another song, huh? Geez. You want to have your cake and eat it too, don't you, Cengiz? He gets upset so easily, doesn't he? Geez. You can do it. How did you write that song? You can write others the same way, Nightingale of Bursa. You believe that? - Of course. - Really? You'll write one even better. - Looking good today. - Stop it. Someone will see us. Anyone would think they're dating. - They look so good together. - They're already together. Are you for real? They'd kill me for telling! Not a word about it to anyone. It's a secret because they don't want to upset the kid. And my brother is afraid of our mom. - Sevda is a widow, you know. - Yeah, who cares if she's a widow? My sister is one too. I wouldn't be upset if a guy asked for her. A secret love affair?

She's beautiful like a princess, don't you think? And God bless you as well, Mr. Osman. - Perfect. - We owe it all to you. That's great. Allah watch over you, you wonderful man. Oh, please, ma'am. It was all of their hard work. Arzu is very talented. A unique voice. And she's gorgeous, of course, which she got from her mother. Hopefully, we will succeed in this. Of course we will. I've got a feeling right here. I just know it. Are you married? Got a wife? Yes and no. Yes and no? It's okay. It's okay. We're in the process of divorcing. We couldn't get along anymore. We're done. Oh, I see. You are quite a good-looking man. I'm sure that a lot of women are after you. That's perfect. This is going to be a special photo. Um, sir? Sir! - Mr. Osman! - Yes, what is it? - Should we get some shots for the press? - Do that. Let's take those, yes? N... Nuri! When they finish up the shoot, get everyone together. Pick up our guests from the hotel too. Let's all have some food together. Çekirge PHOTO STUDIO Arzu. You go around to the front of the car. Front seat. Where are you going? How are we all supposed to fit in the car with that cage? It's not that far! Go on, you can walk. Oh, how wonderful. This really was a great idea. I have been craving a doner kebab. Oh, geez. What? You can be patient. We'll be there in just a few minutes, okay? But I look like I've just run away from my wedding. Oh, Allah! Allah made you say that. I hope that I'll be at your wedding, soon! - Talk it off. - It seems like she never likes anyone. She's always looking for their faults, you know? Here we are. Turn, turn, turn. Right here. Right, right, right, right. - Arzu. - Mmm? Listen. Mr. Osman is getting a divorce soon, I hear. And you know life can get hard. You never know what will be happening the next day. - Isn't that so, Mr. Osman? - Well. Just look at you. My goodness. You're such a good-looking man. You're a man who's got it all. - You've got a real presence to you. - Right here. Thank you. As for your work, all of the artists there can depend on you. - It comes down to fate. - It's written in the stars. - That's right. - What's written? You write it yourself. I could open a store with all the gifts the men who came asking for her brought us. Every one of those guys she turned down. Is there a reason you feel the need to embarrass me in front of Mr. Osman? And still all she ever thinks about is her singing career. Of course, if I'm being honest with you, I think that she should. She has a wonderful voice. And on top of that, she's beautiful. Just one glimpse of her and you'll never need another star as long as you live. Take a good look at her. Huh? So, what shall we do? Yes, dear mother, what do we do? Let's do as you say, because the more I look into those beautiful eyes, that gorgeous green, the more I find myself beginning to lose my mind. So whatever it is that you want, I'll gladly do. - Mr. Osman. - What is it? The record we're doing. Will it bomb? It will. Now, hear me out here. Why don't you get rid of Doctor Fatih, and let Ms. Bülent have them as the openers? - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh, uh... You know, that would really work out great. - Really? - But the thing is, I gave my word to Fatih. Mmm. Welcome, madam. Out of the way, Adnan! - Ms. Bülent is here. - It's good to see you. - Welcome, madam! - Welcome. Ms. Bülent, welcome. Oh, Ms. Bülent, goodness. I can't tell you what a fan I am of all your work. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Allah be with us. May he bless all my fans and everyone here with long and prosperous lives. - Amen. - Amen, ma'am. I felt your love. I feel it so strongly here. Just like moths who are attracted to the fire, our great nation is filled with peop... Hey! Would you start working now? - Everyone here needs to eat right now. - Yes, of course. I'm sorry. Have a seat, Ms. Bülent. - Adnan? - Oh, yes. I wonder why they made us walk. You know she hates birds. So that was probably the issue there. Hmm. I need some water. - You want some? - I want food! I asked if you want some. What's the attitude for? Let's go. Hello everyone. Is that… - Bülent Ersoy? - Welcome, my friends. Now all the Nightingales are here with us. - Thank you, thank you. - Thank you. Uh… What is that? Huh. Do you travel with your bird everywhere you go? - This one can sing like a nightingale. - Yeah. He's a canary but he's gone quiet. He's ill. We're looking for a cure. We'll get that bird to sing. Well, then may Allah watch over you. Amen. Allah be with us. Amen. Oh, cricket! Oh, I adore that game. I played it in Kükürtlü. There's an excellent bathhouse there. Oh, true. No, no. A real cricket. There! As in Jiminy Cricket. Allah, please no! Is that a cricket? It's a grasshoppper and it's huge. Is it stalking me or what? Please, no. Don't whack it over here! Oh, Adnan! It's coming. Oh, God! Don't let it touch me! Don't let... Dear God! We need a doctor here! This man is burning! It hurts so much. Ice! Hurry! Are you okay? Is the cricket still alive? Why would you even ask that? Really? I don't want him to die. Jiminy Cricket. The Nightingale of Bursa, Cengiz Sezen, with his friends. Yes. Yes, all right. All right. Well, thanks. Everyone sends their regards. Thank you. What'd she say? She said to pay all the hospital bills for Doctor Fatih. She also wants us to promote them as the "Nightingales of Bursa." Or else, it's too long. Oh. She's okay with it then? Well, that's great. I'm sure they'll have no objection. And, um, sir? She heard that they're recording. She wants to know why the decision was made without her. Wha... What did you say? It's a demo, I said. And we'd let her hear it. - What did she say? - She said, "Screw your demo," and "you can pay for it on your own." Oh, she's not that mad. We can work with that. That won't be an issue. Here's your tea. Well, that's good news. Let's not lose morale. Call Cengiz. Tell them they're the "Nightingales of Bursa" and we're on for Saturday. - Come on. - Don't let your tea get cold. We're good, yeah. FUN PARK Look at that! I look like I'm a dwarf! We look like we came out of a fairy tale. Look at my little hand. Look at it. Come on. Goal! It's 3-to-1. Right. Yes! BURSA OPEN AIR THEATER Cengiz, look! ON TOMORROW - BÜLENT ERSOY THE NIGHTINGALES OF BURSA - Hey. Oh. Look at that. - The Nightingales of Bursa. Amazing. We're playing in front of this crowd tomorrow. Taşkın, I have the jitters. I could die. Why didn't we release the record before the show? I'm so nervous. Cengiz, why don't you leave the anxiety you've got for tomorrow? We'll use tonight for laughter. Right? - Let's go, Taşkın. - All right. Let's laugh. We're laughing tonight. Let's go, Arzu. ON TONIGHT - AŞK OLSUN Metin Akpınar - Zeki Alasya ♪ Rings on your finger Bracelets… ♪ ♪ Let me caress you, oh, my dear Emine ♪ ♪ You're such a beauty You're such a beauty ♪ ♪ Rings on your finger Bracelets on your arm ♪ ♪ Let me care... ♪ Enough. Enough, stop! What? I'm just dancing, is all! Oh, that's supposed to be actual music? Sounds like strangling a sheep. I guess that you grew up poor. What do you mean by that? You've never sacrificed an animal. You don't strangle a sheep like that. True ladies keep some gauze folded up in their drawers. And you take the sheep and blindfold it. Do it nice and gentle, not too tight though. That would be a sin. Then you take a little rose water and splash it. You light up the agarwood in the censer for the fragrance. That's when you stroke its jowl ever so slightly. You say the words… "Allah is the greatest. Allah is the greatest. There is no god besides Allah, and Allah is the greatest. Allah is the greatest and to Allah all praises belong!" Bravo! Those are real artists right there. What a show. What a show! Would you mind walking Arzu home for me? Of course. - Hey, Sevda. - Yeah? We've got a show tomorrow. Don't let him get too drunk. Oh, don't worry. I don't have any alcohol. What the... Not even one little beer? Taşkın, you want a drink or me? Looks like he's used to having both. Go on, everyone. Why don't we keep on shaming Taşkın. - Let's go, Taşkın. Good night. - Have a good night, Sevda. Good night. - I'm so hungry. - Hungry? Yeah. Then let's go. I have a reputation out at sea, and dupes I never want to see. Conversing is like music if you don't drink too many. I serve blowfish stew for those who knock down twenty. Written by yours truly, Erol. That was an original. Here we are. There you go, miss. Well, Erol. I guess one artist in the family is enough. Though I'm a fan of your poetry. - Thank you, brother. - …my brother. - Are there onions in this salad? - Yes, miss. - Yes. - That won't do. You'll be relatives soon. You should know he won't eat onions. How did you know that? Well, we're always together, you know. When you're over, you always take out the onions. Look at that! Well done. You're very perceptive. Cengiz, it's clear. You're in good hands with this woman. She knows you so well. It's clear that she respects you. She knows you have a good heart. You're very dear to her. Oh, my dear brother Cengiz. Oh! You never were able to find a woman when you were young. - And now you have this love. - What are you saying? Oh, my dear brother, you ate your feelings in your youth. - You wasted your years away. - Uh… You wasted your good years away and found this beautiful girl anyway. What are you saying, Erol? Stop it. Enough now. You're blabbering on. Would you please take this and bring me another? - Right away, Cengiz. - Off you go. Goodbye. Hurry. Oh, man. He loves to talk. That jerk. Uh. He told my fortune with an onion? He sounds like a beggar. What do you think my favorite flowers are? Um, a rose? Violets. Daisies? Marigolds. My favorite flowers are white lilies. - White lilies? - Uh-huh. They smell wonderful, but don't they only live a month or so and then wilt? That's fine by me. They leave their essence with us. - Hmm. - I can wait for another year. So what? - Loyalty. - Yeah. Is it true what he said? Is what true? You never had a girl when you were younger? Is Erol telling the truth? Nothing that left a mark. I mean, nothing worth mentioning. I was always working. Music was my girl. But if I ever got the chance to go back, might do it differently. What would you do differently, for instance? For instance? If we were the same age. If you could return to my age… what would you do? Would you want that? If I was the same age? No way. I think that young guys are usually idiots. Hmm. But you know I really admire you. Really? You're a lovely man. You have a heart of gold. Your art alone is enough, mister. You're incredible. Eh? Yeah. Don't call me mister. When it's just the two of us, when we're alone, it makes me feel bad, and… I feel old, and it gets me down. Do you mind? Sure, all right. Cengiz. Does that sound better? It sounds good. Cengiz. Salad without onions! Oh, come on, man! You really startled us, man. Thank you for everything. Now take a rest. We have plenty. - Get out of here. - Enjoy your food then. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Let's eat. - Want some of this? Thank you. Do you want some of this fish? - Yes, please. - All right. White lilies, you said? Uh-huh. Cengiz. What are we supposed to do now? She's starting with our song. People loved it when we sang it. So what now? This is awful. Yes, we agreed not to record it. But now I can't even perform my own song on stage? So go back there and talk to her. Let her know what you think of the attitude. I will. I'm going to tell her exactly how I feel about her taking our song from us. I'll do it. - Good afternoon, Nightingales. - Oh, hello. Wishing you all, with my deepest love, to have a wonderful show tonight. - Thank you. - Thank you. May Allah… …be on your side and bless you with success. Pray you do well. We are not worried. Are we, sir? Mmm. What's wrong? Cat got your tongue, Mr. Nightingale? This is when you should say thanks. Allah bless you, ma'am. Bless you. Thank you for all your support. My glasses! Ciao. ♪ Fa fa fa fa sol mi re mi mi mi fa ♪ You got cold feet. You don't have the balls, my friend! You couldn't say anything. What was that? She was right there and you said nothing. You're crossing the line, Taşkın. Don't be so ridiculous. You were smothering her. What was I supposed to say? I'm running low on patience here. I'll walk out. I swear. There's no need to be rude, Taşkın. Ah, so it's my fault. - Just shaming Taşkın. - All right. Would you both please stop it? We can ask Dad if we can use some of the songs he's written. We'll just have to make do for tonight. Come on. How long until the performance? - Two hours. - Two. Listen, I have a new song that I wrote the night before. I don't want to rush it though. So let's go and rehearse it while we can. - And if you like it, then we'll do it. - What is it called? "White Lilies."

Who am I to do something like that? I would never. Okay. Sure. See you soon, Mr. Fahrettin. You are going to Istanbul. And so is this. - Yes! - Oh, my... Praise Allah. So happy for you. Praise him. Go and kiss him. Go on. You need to thank him. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Osman. Congratulations. Oh, my darling. You know I told you this would happen. - You really did. - Mm-hmm. Listen! Listen to me! Allah is my witness, I swear to you. I will kill that old shriveled fart myself! I'll rip his stupid wig apart. I swear there's nothing going on between us, Mom. You're lying. How can you say that? He could've died when you kissed Osman. Really. I saw it kill him, there and then. And I saw your face, you whore. God! You made a man your father's age fall in love with you. Your father would kill him if he found out. Oh, Allah. Give me the strength to deal with Arzu. Enough. That bastard wrote the "White Lilies" song for you, didn't he? No. I asked him to write that one. Oh, yeah, right. We wanted a song about flowers. So I made him choose white lilies. When there's all of these songs about roses, lilacs and such. So then I chose white lilies. - You're lying again. - No, I'm not, Mom. Swear on it. Stop it now, Mom! You need to stop pushing. I don't want to hurt my own blood. I've had it! You have got to let me live my own life, damn it! Listen to me! Just forget about that old fart, Cengiz. Just give him five years, and he'll be in diapers and you know it. Just get off it, please, Mom! Don't bet on your beauty, my dear girl. That's because women only really get their true wits when their tits sag to the floor, you'll see. That is enough, Mom. Please! I feel like I'm gonna throw up on the floor now. Thanks. It's not enough. It's isn't enough, trust me. Think of Osman. Osman is head over heels for you. The sorrow he feels when you don't return it, it's killing him. Just think what Osman would mean for you. Osman would mean money, for one thing. And he would be your ticket to Istanbul. Osman would mean that you would have fame, and all the nightclubs, and the limelight. I thought you wanted that, all of those things. Here it is, knocking at our door. My dear, think of us. You can save us from this life. That's all I have to say. You have to figure it out now, Arzu. In Allah's name. Oh, I had almost forgot. For you, Brother. What's this? It's just some of the money that I owe you. Oh, come on. That's money that you earned yourself. Keep it. You're going to need it. Istanbul's expensive. Right. I don't want any hugs or kisses or crying. All right? We're on a mission. Come on. All Istanbul passengers! Departing time. Here I go. Over there. Over there. Oh, this one. All right then. - Have a good trip. Be safe. - Thanks, Mom. - Wishing you good luck, sweetheart. - Amen. We're here in Istanbul. Are you happy? Yes, I am. Are you? Look at us. We finally made it. You know, all of it is thanks to you, Cengiz. It really is. You know we always respected you like a brother, and now you're our real brother. From now on, the three of us are real siblings.

And we gave our previous song to Ms. Bülent. Well, I'm a pianist by trade, but I've got this urge to write and sing and compose... - Stop, please. - Yeah. Sir. What did you think of Ms. Arzu's voice? Kamuran Akkor or Gönül Akkor? Who do you like more? Well, sir, I like them both. Well, actually, Mine Koşan she likes more. You can really that inspiration when she sings, right? Okay.

How many copies of this did you make? 50,000 tapes. And 10,000 records. That's plenty. Don't make any more, okay? Could it be that love has blinded you, Mr. Osman? Can't you really not see it? I hear about everything, Osman. You divorced your wife by proxy, didn't you? What a son of a gun! But that's not the issue. The girl's amazing. It's clear to see how you fell in love. Are you really that stupid though, Osman? Why would you waste her on this record? The Nightingales of Bursa. Really? No one even knows her name. I have a question for you. Just one! Have you ever seen a star like her, who is only a featured singer in a band, on my stage? She should be a soloist. On her own! We both know that this Nightingale should be flying solo, Mr. Osman.

There's really no point in me keeping it a secret anymore. And, yes, I know there's a proper way to go about these things… but when you've fallen in love, you find such things have little value.
