COLLEGE SWING What diabolical invention is it that insults our ears? What is your name? Benny Goodman. You will never achieve anything. It is a pleasure to deliver diplomas to graduates. They will form a line to my left. Mr. Jenkins will remove his chair. Mr. Webster will stop crossing his legs ... limbs. I don't want any kind of demonstration. Remember: It is a solemn occasion. First of all, Miss Dorothea Rutledge. And then Mr. Francis de León ... Mr. Walter Martín ... Miss Fifi Booth ... Mr. Wellington Smith. My friends, graduation ends here ... highest grade in Aldentown village ... in the year of our Lord, 1738. Therefore, I will tell parents ... Come on, girl. I told you not to come up here. - You will not receive your diploma. - Why? Because this is the ninth year you have failed the exams. - Why? - Why did you fail? Yes because? Because in every area of school work ... You are always puzzled by questions. Oh no. They are not the questions. The answers baffle me. Silence! However, I can only repeat that you will not have a diploma. Therefore, parents ... May I suggest a suggestion? Yes. It won't make any sense, but go ahead, girl. That? Instead of sitting at my desk year after year ... Wouldn't it be better if I started making paper ... to be able to do my diploma? Even if you were lucky enough to manage to make paper ... your diploma would be blank because you can't write. True, but it would be silly to have a diploma with letters on it ... because I couldn't read it. Silence! Or could you read it? Shut up, impossible girl, and listen to your grandfather. Your grandmother and I met in this classroom. We send our children here ... and they sent their children here. I see. So if I have children ... Do you want me to bring them to this school with me? Silly stuff! You should be thinking about your diploma. Your grandfather knows what he's saying. It would be nice to have a diploma before having children. It would be better to have a husband. Stop it, no more chattering! If Gracie Alden, my granddaughter, never graduates ... I will leave all my money to this school ... until some Alden woman graduates from her. If no Alden woman graduated ... the money would be the property of the school. Oh! Oh! But when? In accordance with her majesty's law , there must be a date. How long do you think it will take for an Alden woman to graduate? In all honesty, sir, I think ... that a girl like her little Gracie ... He couldn't graduate in 100 years. Maybe not so soon, but I bet he would make it in 200 years. Well, so be it. 200 years. That would be the year 1938. How good! THE PREFERRED LOCATION - Hello Betty. - Hi, Jackie. - Hi, Skinnay. - What's up, Jackson? Come up. You, linda, canta. Teacher, teacher I like to dance the swing Ho ho, look how I dance Teacher, teacher This is a special feature Still don't believe too much You will not be the master's favorite You won't have the beat until you dance the College Swing - Tell me what they called it - University Swing - I don't have the rhythm - No, you don't - I won't stay with him - You won't - Didn't I impress them - No, sir Oh poor me Oh teacher, teacher show this fool Oh tell him what's good When he dances the University Swing - University Swing - Tell me what you call it They don't serve jelly at Notre Dame Not even in the Army vs. Navy game It is part of education College Swing You heard the teacher sing and shout You know the lesson So let's go with the musical group College Swing Listen to the University Swing "If I don't answer, it 's because I'm studying ... "If I don't answer, it 's because I'm studying ... So please come in and wake me up Thanks, Gracie Alden. " My, my, students come and go ... but the Aldens stay forever. - Hi, Gracie. - Hi, Bud. This is hard. Yes. I bet between the pages of these old books ... You find many bones hard to crack. You will say nuts! And some nuts don't even break. Don't worry, Gracie, the main bone is gnawed. Forget the fun, I came on business. - You didn't sign our contract. - How do you know? How? Well, it doesn't have a signature. How do you know that it was me who didn't sign? Perhaps it was someone else who did not sign. Gracie, this contract must be signed for me to show my good faith. Neglect. Your word is enough for me. Yes, but the Trust Company will not do. ¿No? Be nice and sign here. I don't like to sign things that I didn't write. If you want me to write you a poem, I'll sign it. Thanks, but it's a contract. I will explain it to you. For $ 10,000, I'll teach you and guarantee you'll graduate. Do not be silly. If you give me $ 10,000 ... I don't care if I graduate or not. I'm not the one who will give you $ 10,000 ; you will give them to me. So the deal is $ 20,000. Yes. I knew you would understand. Now when the college and the money are yours ... you will hire me as your manager and advisor ... for a salary of 25 thousand per year plus the usual benefits. The usual benefits? Don't change the subject. Will you sign this contract or will I sign this contract? - Your. - Well, don't pretend I'll do it. Gracie, whatever you say. Here's my pen. Sign there. Wait. Will this be legal if I sign with your pen? Could you keep a secret? Sure! It's not actually my pen. That is even better. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Do you want a drink? - Of course. I am inclined to doubt whether Mr. Brady's request is correct. It is totally correct. I do not ask the questions that will be in the final exam. I never would. As your teacher, I am interested in what will be covered in general. I try to protect my ten thousand dollars ... to my delicate client. We have a letter from Mr. Hubert Dash ... a descendant of the founder of this school ... and an outstanding student of this university. Hey, this Hubert Dash is kind of wacky ... It's a bit eccentric, isn't it? He has, or at least had, a marked phobia of women. His fear of women led him to the jungle of South America. And there he consoled himself when he discovered a gold mine worth 25 million. He came back recently and I asked him ... to prepare and carry out Alden's graduation exam. Here is your acceptance. You see, Mr. Brady ... none of us know what your exam will contain. - Sorry. GeorgeJonas. - Yes, Mr. Dash's assistant. - Mr. Ashburn? - Yes. How are you doing? Professor Brisa, Dean Sleet ... Dr. Lluvia, Professor Storm. Is this a university or the meteorologist? And Mr. Brady, Ms. Alden's teacher. Where is Mr. Dash? Send your apologies. You know, women. - Women? - The usual phobia. It got worse after being away from them for 20 years. Mr. Dash needs bodyguards to keep the women away. That's more or less my job. And pushing women away seems very enjoyable. And Ms. Alden's final exam ? Mr. Dash prepared a list of questions. - I'm dying to see them. - I made several copies. - There you have them? -Yes. How annoying these flies! Pick up the phone, President Ashburn. I didn't hear it ring. Well, don't wait until the last minute. Well, thank you, a thousand thanks. It will not be easy. "What element does bread contain that provides heat to the body?" What element does bread contain that provides heat to the body? I'll let you find out. Goodbye. Geez, guys. Any girl but this one. Virginia Ashburn no. I have ... I have a personal motive. Ómicron Tau ignores personal reasons. Your initiation dictates that you serenade the president's daughter. Please, guys. I am in love with her. Oh no, brother Bates. You haven't even dated her. I know, Skinnay, but that's why. How can I enter your life looking like this? - We can do this? - Sure. My friends!

No, Dean Sleet. It is... It's ironic, it's tragic, it's strange. He is drunk. Nerd. No! Good evening, Dean Sleet. An intoxicated jester! - Young man, your name. - What does it matter now? His name is Martín Bates, and this is his initiation in Ómicron Tau. His uncle is Hubert Dash ... and his guardian is the Trust Company. She knows me. Oh, I remember. I'm afraid Mr. Bates is a little ... We'll skip it this time ... but you better go back to your fraternity. Yes ma'am. I still believe that these initiations that include semi-nudity ... they are definitely indecent. Thank you dear. The air currents affect me . - Here you have. - You stuck your thumb in the soup. Do not worry. The soup is not hot. Don't worry me? Can't they do better than being waiters? So is. With this we pay for the university.

Professor Chinn is a very well educated gentleman . I know we will enjoy if he talks to us ... of everything he studied in those universities. - I did not study anything. - How do you say? All my life I've been in college. I attended like everyone else. Your children will do it just like their mothers and fathers ... But I want to say one thing ... The situation has ... I couldn't understand why. So Washington would be proud that I, by myself ... Girls and boys, I present to you another new teacher from Ms. Alden: The doctor of music, Yascha Koloski.

A gentleman named Ben Volt. Of course, I will stay here for the first session ... just in case. Young ladies, Professor Volt. - How are you? - Professor Volt? Professor, why the marathon? It was just warming up. Professor Volt, did you lose control? Oh, I'll go get it. Oh, here it is! I design a device to answer the announcers. I always want to contradict the announcers ... after they make some egregious comment. How vegetarian. It would be very helpful to be able to answer the radio announcers ... after a sales pitch. How much do you plan to charge for your invention? Oh, $ 49 cash ... or in weekly payments. How much weekly? Well, that ... I'll calculate it. They should put light in here. Now, let me see. It would be seven payments. 49 out of seven are ... Nine out of seven: One; I take two. 42 times seven is six. It would be seven payments of $ 61 each. That doesn't seem right. Multiply 61 by seven and see if you get 49. You are skeptical, right? Seven by one: Seven. Seven sixes is 42. Seven plus two equals nine. Forty nine. To clarify this, can I write 61 seven times and add them up? On the contrary, go ahead. My father used to say: "The figures don't lie ... but liars can encrypt. " You add them. Sure. Seven sixes is 42. 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. Forty-nine in a straight line. Young man, are you mastering calisthenics as well as math? Calisthenics? Hold this.

Take a pulley. Very well. Pull it up. Very well. First, build your back muscles. Open them like this. Very well. Second, build your shoulder muscles. I'll show you. So. Now back up. Now let go. Come on, girls. Young man, do you know anything about calisthenics? About boxing? - Fencing? Wrestling? - Oh yeah. What wrestling school do you prefer? Simple wrestling. - Which girl do you prefer? - The blonde. She. Wrestling is the manly art of self defense. Protects. Here I go. I better teach you jiu-jitsu. This is called the arm lock. Nobody can get away. That. You see? I've been robbed. - Is this what you mean? - Ahead. Do it. You better fight, professor. Who's next? I will fight with whatever. Enough wrestling. Now, fencing. Professor Volt, choose your weapon. I win? I'll take the one that's left-handed. Thank you. Cute gift. - En garde. - What happened? Do I owe you money or something? Should you drop out of college?

Ginna, could you put this in the mail? I guess it's a love letter. It's my letter of resignation. Resignation? Dad, you can't do that. You must not. Conditions under the authority of our crazy friend ... they are too dangerous and humiliating for me. It takes a tougher hand than mine. That gives me an idea. My uncle Hubert ... - Who? - My uncle from the gold mines. It has millions. Promise not to quit until you talk to him. - I don't know how ... - You're right. Promise not to quit. I haven't spoken to Hubert Dash since I was a student. Even so... - Very good, young man. - Thank my Lord. Henceforth, I will dedicate my life to protecting Virginia and you ... Sorry. It was not my intention. I'm sorry. Nothing happened. It's still on. Well, good night. I'm sorry. Goodnight. Wow. There is nothing so refreshing and so stimulating ... like a cup of tea after exercise. - Another cup? - No thanks. No? It is my favorite tea. Chinese black tea ... - No thanks. - You don't want tea. Yeast rolls? I remember my days at Twickenham. You will enjoy them in England. I don't want to go to England, man. I love Alden University. Do you love her? That sounds like romance. Who is the woman after you? - No woman is chasing me. - They all do. They are like felines in the jungle. They sniff at a man and harass him. They prowl, sharpen their claws and jump. If you went to Alden, you would see that the university ... I have no reason to go. It is full of women. Many college girls who always cheat me. When I least expect it, one of them will cajole me and ruin me. I know, I'm unpacking. - Well. I will not go. - You will not go? Sure, if you prefer to be the laughingstock of the country ... The laughing stock of the country? Why would they laugh at me? For designing an exam that even silly Gracie Alden passed. Never talk about it. Do not you dare. I have never understood how Gracie Alden approved it. There were goings-on. I see cunning in the air. It is a ruse. All women are crafty. Gracie is a woman, and therefore she is crafty. I will face it. I will baffle her. I will confuse her! Jonas! Pack my suitcase. I will go. GRACIE'S UNIVERSITY DEED IS DENIED PROPERTY HOLDS WAITING FOR A NEW EXAM - FRAUD SUSPECTED What is this? Here we get off? Where we are? In his nephew's fraternity. Here it is safe. Women are not allowed. - How good. - Officially. - Officially? Do they get in? - No. - You just said ... - I was joking. - A slight attempt to be funny. - Yes, very slight. There is no time to be funny. If I run into a woman, I'll get out of here. Uncle Hubert! - What happen? - Inside the house, quick! With everything and the phobia, I won't go into a man's bedroom. You are a teacher of practical romance. Can't you be practical? What if you went into a bedroom? It depends on the girl. Don't change the subject. If Hubert Dash sees you, there will be no exam. - Explain the joke. - Wait, Snow White. If Gracie fails, we will all be unemployed. I think someone told you about the laundry list. I get it. They would never have that list if I had washed my clothes by hand. What is this goofy thing you're planning? Tejemaneje? Tonight, go to Omicron Tau's house . Dash will be there. In which bedroom? The one on the corner, the one with the pergola. Say no more, Svengali. You have to scare him so much that he flies to South America. You put me up on that pergola and I'll do the rest. Baby, come get your reward. En garde. - Contact. - Yes, man. You are very advanced in your lessons, eh? - I have taken private lessons. - I get it. - You asked for it. - Well said. Hold on. That kiss made you swoon. Sure. You kiss like a vacuum cleaner. I don't like this room. I don't like this room. Where is my nephew? This room is not safe. All the windows face the roof of that ... - Pergola. - Don't tell me what it is. Any desperate woman could get in there. Why don't you use my room? But if it is full of photographs of artists. I'll keep that room. Stop smiling like that. They don't take me seriously. Don't answer me like that. Where is my nephew? Hi. - And my nephew? Ah, Martin. - What happen? I want a safe room or I'll go. - Use mine down the hall. - On this floor? In a corner? I will use it. Wait! - Do you have one of those ... - Pergola. Don't tell me what it is. Do you have it? Let's go to see her. - How are you? - How is it going? What time is it? A woman in this room at this hour? It's ridiculous! It is impossible! It is a dream. You are adorable too, but I didn't come to tell you that. It's Gracie Alden. Do not tell me. Why are you here at this hour? - I couldn't get there earlier. - You must leave immediately. Go away! How do you think of it? What an occurrence. A woman in my room. What will people say? How does this look? - Very cute. Was a present? - It's silk. I ... A woman in my room. How awful. That's what I came to warn you. - It will arrive at any moment. - Who? The woman they will send to make love to him and to commit him. That's ridiculous. Everyone knows what I think about that. I hate women! I do not like them. Well, you won't like the one to come ... because men like it whether they like it or not. Professor Theresa! Have you been drinking? You like tricks, don't you? Silence. Do you want us to be thrown out of here? Expel us? Who is going to expel me? Tell me! Silence. Silence. - Close the door. - It's already closed. Yes? Hide the key. It would be foolish to hide her because she would only have ... to enter, find the key and open. Yes? Sure. You think of everything. - Get rid of the key. - That's much better. - Now you will feel safe. - In this emotional turmoil? I will never be the same. Look at that face. Look at those eyes. I am changed, and it was thanks to you, Gracie Alden. You're welcome, Hubie. You can do something for me one day. If a woman walked in, think what a disgrace it would be ... for people to hear her scream, "I love you! I love you!" - Full throttle. - I have chills thinking about it. And then, get that door slammed ... and they will find her hugging him ... and covering him with kisses, like this. - How? - So. Kiss Fifi goodbye. Please. Monsieur, I ... ¡Betty! Please! Please! He likes to play, huh? Monsieur, how shameful this is. You cannot do this. Where does it take me? Silence. - Hi there? It's Martin. - That? Do you want to talk to Ginna after what you did? Ginna doesn't want to talk to you! Hi there? Hi there? Monsieur, give me a call sometime. I will call you! ¡Caray! Hi. Yes, this is George Jonas. Who? The manager of the Cafe La Pantufla Azul? That? He is mad. Mr. Dash never goes to nightclubs. Seriously? And is a woman with him? They left 5 minutes ago. Yes, without paying the bill. He told me that you would pay for it. The bill is $ 85. ¿Hubert? - Don't you think I am pretty? - Yes, Gracie. You're right. You know? Your shoulder is nice, comfortable and wide. Did the car include it or was it separate? Gracie, let's not talk. Let's not say anything. Let's sit here to drink the morning air. You drank it too fast, Hubie. Look at that sky, look at the sun, and those trees and flowers. Why is nature so beautiful at this hour? Everything makes me think of love, Gracie. What are you thinking about? In clams. Are they not beautiful? I hope I didn't remind you. No. I was just thinking that ... if we were clams, we wouldn't take our shoes off. Wouldn't that be wonderful? Yes, I guess so. But, Gracie, leave the clams for a minute ... I want to ask you for something. Something that I have never asked of any woman. - Gracie, would you accept ... - Yes, Hubert. - Could you ... - Yes, Hubert. - You think you could ... - It would be my pleasure, Hubert. Sing me a love song? You have an innate talent You definitely own it In a world ... Please wait. I forgot the lyrics. Please start over. You have an innate talent You definitely own it In a Clark Gables world I found you You came straight from the sky Like a lucky number In a world full of fables you became reality The moment you passed me I told myself, I told myself He is the man who qualifies Satisfies the conditions Fills my eye Because you have an innate talent An innate talent So naturally I would like to reach To the altar just one more risk Naturally with you To!

The first demonstration will be the practical romance ... de Mademoiselle Theresa Therese... and the physical education teacher ... Ben Volt. We were a very caramel couple We danced very intimately But since we started dancing that thing called Rumba In a way, I lost you I knew as soon as that rhythm started That soon we would part And now look at us I am here You are there You never hold me for a second Why did the Cubans come up with See what a Rumba does to romance I go north you go south But don't forget to write and tell me how the weather is I understand that we dance together See what a Rumba does to romance Ay, tell me why can't they play a fox-trot A good fox-trot This dance is the loneliest I am here You are there We have to scream the tender words It's like you're my little brother It's like I'm in France That's what a Rumba does to romance Come here! That's what a Rumba does to romance - You wanted to see me? - What if I want to see you? More than anyone in the whole world. And I thought you didn't even care. Linda, this is important. See this bag and these glasses? You know that they are? I'd say this is a bag and those are glasses. They are for the exam tonight. This is a radio. These are headphones and this is a microphone. All you have to do is wear the glasses ... and I will transmit the answers to you through this microphone. Now ladies and gentlemen ... Miss Alden's all- important exam . Miss Alden, this is Mr. Hubert Dash. Wow. Hi, Hubie. Now, we will begin. It will be an oral exam. You will not need glasses. If I didn't have these glasses on ... I couldn't see anything you say. It could be that he saw with his nose. So is. - See with your nose? - I see what perfume I like. Miss Alden? That is an easy question. I'm Miss Alden. Ask me a more difficult one. In literature, who spearheaded transcendentalism? Theodore Parker, Bronson Alcott... Theodore Parker... Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Right. We get many of our words from Danish . Name six. Watch out. To call. Boy. Husband. Sister. To die. Right. I am correct because I gave the appropriate answer. If I was wrong, it would be wrong. Did you hear that? He answered the other two correctly. I doubt I can write "cat." Oh yeah? So, you ask him some questions. Of course, if that's okay with you. Of course. Ask me anything. Why don't you ask me about the laws of gravity? What does vitamin C contain? What runs on the ground like a little fish? Wait! What runs on the ground like a little fish? It has feathers? What if it has feathers? Does it hang from the ceiling and whistle? What hangs from the ceiling and whistles? - I give up. - Do you give up? You have the most difficult riddles of all. I give up. I do not want to play. A few questions on US history. In what year did the state of Texas ... By the way, say the capital of Texas. Austin. In what year was Texas admitted to the Union? 1845. Miss Alden, you're getting hoarse. Take a throat lozenge . - Mr. Dash, can I have one? - Of course. Oh, it's the last one in the box. - You can take this one. - Thank you. What is it from? It is menthol. - Thank you. - Thank you. Miss Alden, I want you to pay close attention. I'll ask you about natural sciences. Say the three divisions of the Earth ... according to physiography. Lithosphere ... Right. The next. Mineralogy, oceanography, petrology and meteorology ... are the divisions of what general science? Right. She did not say anything. Don't tell me you didn't say anything. - I did not say that. - Of course. And it bothers me. I have a very good ear. I heard her clearly with a hoarse voice. Did you say something in a hoarse voice? No, because I couldn't hear the answers. The glasses! Gracie, put your glasses on. - That? - The glasses. Ah, my glasses. Yes. Something extraordinary happened. I still don't know what it is ... - I know it. - Inform the public. I'm too busy to take over a university. It interferes with my education. I know Alden University is a beauty ... But I can't wear it to a dance, can I? Answer me. Or if? - I do not know what is he talking about. - Sure, anyway. Alden University has always been a burden to me. The only thing I want to carry is a pearl necklace. I've been here for many years. An ancestor of mine founded the university. She established? Well, you can keep her for being honest. - Keep it? - Whoever covers it, keeps it. Silence please! Sr. Dash, ¿me permite? No more questions, professor. And it's not that I'm worried about the exam. I can answer any question Bud might hear. You see, this is a radio and these are the headphones. Bud has many books in his office. Every time you ask a question, he looks for it ... and transmits the answer to me. It is a wonderful system. They will use it soon in all the good universities. There is Bud. Oh no. You will not leave. Come here, duckling. Gracie's comments sure gave them the impression ... that there was a hoax. And he would like to explain ... if possible. We don't need explanations. Miss Alden ... He gave the university back to those of us who worship it. - Thank you. - Thanks to you. But what about the monetary promise you made me? Monetary promise? Yes. How I pay for my services ... You promised me a fairly large amount . Of course not. I promised you 25 thousand dollars. Here's the check. - It's good? - I think so. Not every day you get $ 25,000. Wait. Here's a bug. This check is for Mrs. Mabel Brady. 25 thousand dollars! This is wonderful! Let's go! Ginna, let me explain. Would you leave me ... Ginna, we can tell you now. I went up to Martín's bedroom by mistake. He wanted to get into Hubert Dash's. And if you don't believe me, ask George Washington. Ask me anything. - Bobo. - You think much. - Contact. - En garde. - That's. Come, princess of the jungle. - I'm coming, Turangi. From now on, no matter what they say, I will be authentic ... because when I am, I look more like myself than anyone. But if you are half as cute as you are ... you'll be twice as cute as who you are ... when you're not authentic Hubie, were you serious what you said last night? Last night? What happened last night? - It was before we were married. - We married? Of course. Do you think this is candy? Of course! Sure, Jonas. That's right, we got married. That's what he couldn't remember.
