It was my first professional movie. I was very entertained by the idea of being able to go into video stores and find it on the shelf. It's funny because when you go to Blockbuster you'll find it in the horror section. To my great surprise, to this day, inexplicably, it was listed in the comedy section. I guess it's a thriller with a bit of a horror twist to it. -The story has the logic of a nightmare. -Well, it's a thriller -To me it's not really a horror film. -I'm not a big fan of horror. -It's definitely a psychological thriller. -First of all, it's a very... -strange, horrible fairy tale. -Incredible action in this movie. Drive and hunt and scare. -You could possibly put it into the action section. -It's a mind fuck. I've never exactly felt comfortable with quote part with it being a harmony. It's a weird movie, i mean, it's still a movie about a killer. Certainly somewhere between that and thriller. Some sort of suspense thriller, horror in there somewhere. I don't think there's any moment where you wouldn't think that this could happen out there. If you've never seen this film, you can't look a this film and know what's going to happen. THE HITCHER "HOW DO THESE MOVIES GET MADE?" The inspiration for The Hitcher was the Dora song Riders in the Storm which is about a Hitchhiking killer. And I always loved the song and thought that it was a great opening for a film. So I started with the screenplay of The Hitcher. I started with the opening 1012 odd page scene between Jim Halsey and John Ryder. And basically went from there. I got a copy of the California Production Manual, first of all while I was living in Texas. And went down the list of all the producers And I sent what's called a query letter. Basically, I sent a half page description of the story, and I kind of dared people to read it. I got a 40% response, and I actually got to Ed Feldman by accident. I'd sent the letter, actually, to a producer named Phil Feldman who produced The Wild Bunch, And I said, I thought , this is probably a good idea to take a look at the picture. And it got to Ed's company by accident. My associate at the time, David Bombeck, thought it was a very good idea for a movie, and he said "could he develop it?" And so we developed a movie over the phone. We never met Eric Read, until we had the final draft of the picture. We used to do. He would be on payphones in Texas and we would talk over the project with them. Between the time i was a still photographer and the time i became a director, I was a camera, i was a DP for some number of year. Not something i really wanted to do for a living but i felt this was a logical progression from still photography, and a position in which i could really learn much more clearly how movies are made and get closer to the action, so to speak. And Robert had done a short film called "China Lake", which had a very it was about a rogue cop and it was shot in widescreen and had the same sense of hard edged realism and violent psychology. And China lake was in the same spirit and genre as The Hitcher, and he had been a stills cameraman. I don't know, we were just overwhelmed by his work on China Lake. My agent at the time called, and i stille remember this word, he said to me, i have a project i'm going to send you, and you're not going to believe, he said, how much fun you're going to have making this movie. My agent sent over the script of this thing called The Hitcher and as i was reading it, i was thinking, why did i ever make the right short film to get this job? Because, in effect, already made the movie. John Seal had done witness for me. Just to meet John Seal you want to keep working with him forever? He's really such unique individual. And Ed said "you should listen". You should check out this guy, John Seal. Of course, i never heard of him. Nobody in America had heard of him at that time. I wasn't too impressed with the script. I did feel that there are an awful lot of people killed in the first 36 minutes, and a lot of it, as written, was slow motion death. And i wasn't really honestly prepared for that. So i had a long talk to Robert Harmon, on the phone, and profit that and said look, i'm a little worried that there's so many people just getting slaughtered in slow motion. And he said "no, let me tell you how i'd like to see the film made". And i think 23 minutes later i signed up. And i hired him, i'd never met him. I met him the first time he came to L.A to begin work on the movie, and it proved to be a very happy collaboration. There was a brief period, i recall, in which we were discussing Terrence Stamp. Somebody was very interested in, and it didn't work out. Terrence was very clear that he felt that it would take him in a place he didn't want to go at that moment. That's how he put it. And he's been very kind in the year since, i run into him every now and then. And he has always expressed a regret that he'd made the decision because he seems apparently he's a fan of the movie. Sam Elliott came through an interview. We interviewed him one Sunday morning at somebody's office in the San Fernando Valley. He was so scary that i was afraid to go out in my car and even drive by anyone, but it i thought he was going to do the film and then he backed out at the 11th hour and we got Rutka. We were fortunate to get an actor of Rutka's caliber. Yes, Rutker was, i thought, an unattainable possibility. I believe what pushed him over the edge was that the screened my short. He wanted to see what i had done as a director. I saw a short film that he had financed himself because he was tired of being a set photographer, or a Playboy photographer. He was for two years, and he wanted to photograph movies. And it was a wonderful movie. I saw that film along with the script, and i just felt look that, i got to do this movie. John Rider is, on one hand, a very tough, resourceful, murderous character, but on another hand, no longer wants to live or continue. But he wants to stick around long enough to pass on to this one kid this one person who he finds has a course of life, how to be, in his terms, strong enough to survive. In the original script, it was described as skeletal, with apologies to him. I remember that Eric Red used to talk about Keith Richards as the model. He was also described in the script that i recall reading first, as having no natural voice, but he had sort of an electronic voice box. I think in general, their portrayal, physically and emotionally of the writer character in the original script was a little bit more monstrous. He was certainly a human being, but he was, i think, without goodness, without any quality of... anything human. He was just a force of horror and awfulness. There's so many elements to it that we think about, because Rutgers character shows up at the right time, at the right place, is he magic? -Is he supernatural? -John Ryder? That's a rental company. This guy's name is not John Ryder, forget it. And to me, he doesn't exist. He's just a piece, he's just a ghost that comes out of the desert sand and starts haunting people. He's shooting down helicopters with pistols, he's slicing people up left and right and they can't catch him, he can sneak into a jailhouse and kill all the cops, and unlock my cell without me knowing. There are valid criticism of the movie in terms of how could he pop up here, and how could he pop up there, and how could he know where he was? And all those questions, which are, from one point of view, valid questions, but from my point of view and i believe from Eric, Ed Feldman's and all the other filmmakers involved in the movie, the questions is not appropriate. It might say, if you don't get it, don't get it. But the movie is not supposed to work on this super real level. I think it's a normal story of a serial killer. Except the cleverness of the script made it more he made, made the man more than just a character on television, where you see villains today, he made... i think it's one of the most horrorific characters in the history of films. And i think that's why the picture enjoyed the success it did. To me, the first thing that is scary about a character is intelligence. If the guy is intelligent, and now we know, they are around, but that's scary. So, you know, you can't fool them too easily. You have to be smart to fool them. It lifts up the whole story. It lifts up the bad guy. It lifts up the the hero. The more complicated, the more complex the bad guy is, the better the hero is off when he finally gets it, my character shows him that i want to win that i'm not so fearful that i'll just collapse and let you stick that knife in my heart and drain my life. I want to survive. And he recognizes that, and that inspires him to take me to the next level. He says "okay, kid, i'm taking you on a ride". In terms of the character, i thought, this is a guy who knows he's very sick, but he doesn't quite know where to go to have it fixed or he doesn't know how to end it. He has a coward too. If he would have the guts to commit suicide, that will be fine, but he doesn't have that. So i guess somewhere in his mind he comes up with and idea that if he can just find somebody who gives a little shit. He can have some fun with, and then ask him to just take him out of the way. Now, i thought Rudka's character was a very well balanced, weirdo in the desert and very frightening, because of that, because he was subdued too. He just wasn't some screaming maniac. He was very subdued and evil about the whole thing. And i think that build a suspence in the film that might not have occurred otherwise. Rider wants to teach the kid, train the kid, make him, strengthen him, forge him. And the kid, like all people who are in the process of being challenged by someone has both a terror and a respect for this guy. And also, by the end of it, desire to rid the world of him. It may be a slightly twisted view of it. But at the end of the movie i certainly have always felt that Tommy has left to wonder whether or not if i could. If the hell of Tommy's character if the Halsey character could turn back the clock, and choose to have never met John Ryder. I'm not so sure that he would choose that, he would change anything at the end. There's that moment when Rutger is laying on the pavement, and Tommy walks up to him, and he certainly believes that he's dead. The fact that he isn't, is immaterial at that moment. And he kind of caresses his hair with the gun. It's a sort of farewell. He's not walking over to him with the gun, and putting five more bullets in them, or turning the rifle around and bashing. It just would be completely wrong. There's a certain gentleness, is almost... controversial, though this, may be almost a thank you, involved in it. That's how i've always felt about it. I was doing a tremendous amount of driving, around the Califiornia area looking for locations. So it was incredibly carefully picked locations. And they were carefully picked as far as their design, where the mountains laid out, where the sun was, all these elements that came together. It was shot down in the areas around El Centro, California. On through the Death Valley into the Vegas area. So you get that really old style western look. A lot of the pre production was trying to suss out how Robert wanted to handle it and how to make the desert look basically a beautiful place, where this madness was going on. I don't know how many people respond to this, but it was shot in a wide screen form in True Anamorphic 235, Panavision and if you see it in that form, certainly on a screen, on a big screen, it has a certain scope to it. And i also think, so much of the movie is about, you might say, figures in a landscape. And as soon as you begin to have enormous scope shots with small cars and small figures, you start to feel a certain scale to it. I feel that John's great strength is that, his work is beautiful, but always natural. You don't get the feeling for the most part, of a camera trying to show off. He films in a very humanistc way. He doesn't try, but when he has to shoot in a small area, he does it in a small area. And in fact, i like it, because in some ways i feel putting a camera in the area that the actors must be in. Say, like inside a car or a small jail cell, or shed or whatever. If the camera is included with the actors inside, somehow i think it's a better way of making a film, than when you pull a wall out. The actor's psych, knows that it's a fake set. We know it's a fake set. And the camera almost proves that it's a fake set, because it can shoot from angles that aren't real. How about that shoot on the Western dolly, down low on the road after i kick Rutger out? And it comes zooming up to him as he stands up and he just pans up with the man. He was on a sandbag on a dolly himself, having two boys push him down the street. And of course, it's cinematography. That's good stuff, you know? It's not television. It's big and it's wild. You know, It's open. The process of working with a younger director, i find, can be quite exciting, because they know no limitations. Their imagination goes rampant. And in a way, that's fun. Because Eric's writing was, like, rampant. He had this stuff in there. And then Robert, i think, very wisely, was pulling it back and doing it by inference. And i think that young innocence of new writers and new directors is very exciting to work with this. The experience was very intense, and i was a young actor, with limited skill and limited tools, at the age of 18. That was put into a very life altering situation. I mean, as... i'm talking here in my real life, not in the movie. I really had to deal with Rutger, who is very intense, and that was possibly the peak of his Rutgernance, if that makes any sense. And he was a very intense, very intimidating person. I remembere how excited he was you know, when he knew that we were going to do it. And he said, i've never acted before, really. And now i'm going to act now. And he was stoked. And what i loved specifically about him, that he was totally into whatever would happen between us in the scene. And i was also working with the amazing Jennifer Jason Lee. Who is as equally intense when it comes to her craft, because this is an actress who has many skills, and many tools in her bag. And she made the choice to never break the character, out of the scene, in the scene. She was always that character. So here i was, the third in this triangle of some people who showed up every day to kick some ass. And i felt, for the first time pressure. What real pressure was to deliver. There's this moment where i actually elbow him out of the car, after he's had the knife and he catches a tear off of my cheek and he holds the knife up to the camera, and the tear runs down the blade. This is not written stuff, this is Rutker. And i'm like "Dude, don't fucking stab me in the eye with that knife". And he's very intense with it. Picking my tear up. And letting the tear run down the blade. And these are the things that i think people picked up as homo erotic moments, when i spit on him in the jail cell and he licks it up. Why would he do that? Is he gay? Dude? It's just interesting filmmaking. I was just as creative as i can be, and i always come up with hundreds of ideas, and then it's sort of up to the director to say, okay that can go, and that you can keep. And i was fascinated working with him. I just couldn't... he'd be driving down the desert, full speed in the black truck, and there's a white hanky blowing out the windows of the truck. And that's just Rutger holding hanky out as he's driving. And the director is not going to say "ehi, bro, put the hanky out the window. The sports of this picture, to me, and the way the character sort of dances around with the characters in the movie and with the audience as well, is that, he has to put them on the wrong leg in order to surprise him again. And that was my goal, basically. The thing is, he doesn't sit down and explain to everybody, okay, director, this is what i'm doing. Producers, this is what i'm doing. I mean... he just goes and we're all going, "what's he got the white hanky out the window for?" I don't know. Do you want to ask him? Not really. What's for lunch? And you watch it, and there's a reason for it. And it pays off at the end. There's a wonderful scene where Riders just shot two police officers in the car, when he's trying to turn himself in, and the kid grabs a gun and it's it, he's going to commit suicide. There's no reason to live. The nightmare is going to end, and he puts the gun under his jaw. When the director yelled action, it was like something took over. There was this and it's one of a really beautiful moment, where i fell out of the car and i raised my fingers, and i started going bang, bang, and kind of losing it., and i started to rub this dirt in my face, and i looked up to the sky, kind of pleading to God, just in time, which normally would have ruined the movie, for a big cloud to move away, and hit me right in the face. And that's when my character just stood up, shook it off, and said, i'm going to fucking meet this guy, i'm going to take this guy on. And it all happen in the moment. The director was clever enough to appreciate the work that took place, as oppose to we had a lighting change. We got to do that one more time. My DP, John Seals, who is an Academy Award winning DP, probably my favorite and most talented DP i've ever worked with, said, in his Australian accent, mate, look at that there. Let's just give another shot of that cloud. Go and bar it here, we cut it in. It's a brilliant moment, mate. And that's what they did. And it's funny how fans pick up on that stuff. Because they've seen the movie again and again and again, and they start seeing that stuff. There's so much to be intimidated by, that most of the audiance are always sort of in the same mode as he is. Once you're past that, you can start seeing other things, which is great fun. We desperately tried to find angles, and ways of shooting the stunts, that would be... that would maximize the stunt effect. It was a stunt movie and i went for it. I'd had an idea which seemed, at the time like a good one. Everybody has to remember, this was before the days of computer animation of any kind. There weren't even that many computers behind the scene. Much less involved in actually making the movie. It was a sequence of the movie where the three cars line up side by side, the end of the chase scene. Two colleagues cars are flanking Tommy Howell, and Jennifer's car, which is in the middle. They're about to shoot him from either side out of their two police cars, and the Tommy Hall character gets the idea to jam on the brakes. And since they're all moving down the road together at 65 miles an hour or so, when he puts on those brakes, he would therefore immediately back away and the two cops would, in fact, shoot each other, which is what happened. So i had this bit of coverage that occured to me, that we would take a camera car, an insert car, sometimes called, and crane off the side of that car with a camera. Off a little crane arm. So our camera car is driving behind one of the two cop cars, and we are craned out, and flying along the roadway, about that far off the ground, six inches or so off the ground. So the road is whizzing by the camera. The idea that was when Tommy Howell's car hits its brakes, of course, it would immediately come right back at the camera. But since we're on a crane arm, theorically, as that happened, we could go and move the camera right over, and let that car go right under the lens. We would continue traveling at 60 miles an hour, as two cop cars begin to roll. Completely insane idea. We did the stunt and it all went off very well, until see Thomas How's car went backwards. The camera went in the air, shot underneath. The other two cars started to go into their turn, and should have made safe. But the outer one went into a long slide, and crossed over and came into the insert vehicle lane. And, of course, it was shedding speed a lot faster than the insert vehicle. And the insert vehicle driver, who was a fantastic driver, he realized that he had men on top of the vehicle. He had a camera on the front of the vehicle, as well on a low platform. So he had a men on the front of his vehicle, who was now looking like he was going to be squashed between the police car and the insert vehicle. So in a split second, he made a decision to put the right hand wheel down, And swerve the insert vehicle to the right. And it just ended up sliding sideways, trying not to hit the police car with the guys on the roof. And we shuddered to a halt. The one thing i never want on in a picture is anyone to get hurt. No movie is worth anyone getting hurt. It doesn't matter how well we planned things back then, there was always an opening for accidents to happen. And luckily, the professionalism of that man's driving was such that we just got out of that quite happily, but we're pretty careful again after that. Rutger was amazing, man. I remember one scene at the patrol gas station that he had to drive out of the shed of the garage, out of the door, smashed the door, and then he had to go up and around and come back, and knock over all the petrol pumps. And the stunt coordinator tried it with the door open, and he drove out, roared up the top, turned the wheel, couldn't make it, slammed it in reverse, went back, filled, came down and knocked over the pumps. And Ruth had just stood there looking at it and he said, "let me do it, we'll roll film." so all the cameras were set up and we rolled film, and he crashed out of that garage, he went up and did a full power turn, without stopping and backing and filling, and rolled down and knocked the pumps over. And i think the poor stuntmen sat there with their mouths open, because he did something that really even a good stuntman was having trouble doing. He just did it like that. There was a love scene in the motel room, but i remember when we were going to film that scene. Jennifer, i believe, wasn't feeling, that was a truthful moment. She felt like that was one of those Hollywood moments, that like, okay, here's where the guy in the movie sleeps with the girl in the movie. Oh, wait a minute. Everybody's dead and we're running for our lives. Hello. That scene has changed a bit, it didn't seem to feel right that Nash and Halsey would have sex, there was something... it's not a consummated relationship between the two of them. And she's gonna get torn apart bewteen two tracks. and it was it, was better to keep the tension that it might happen, but not consummate it. They already like each other there. They're surviving. There's already a bond. It's a survival bond, and that's heavy than anything. I feel that a film scorer's job is to help tell the story. In a sense, you should almost be able to turn the dialogue off, and have the music tell the story. There's a film called "Mrs. Soffel", that mark did the score for. Again, it must have been one of his very first scores. I thought it was fantastic. I really liked the movie too, but i walked out of the movie and i was so amazed by the music. He just called me. he must have gotten my phone number from my agent or something, and said, i've been a fan of yours. And we had several long phone conversations long before we met. And he just expressed his enthusiasm and describing what he wanted to make. It all sounded fascinating to me and he said yes. And i still don't quite know why, but we've been friends ever since, -and worked together many times. -I fortunately came into this business, when video was available to the common man, and so i could have a video machine at home and work directly to the picture. Having a synthesizer keyboard and a computer, so i can play something in. Record it in the computer. Hit play on the video, hit play on the computer, and become an audience for a moment, and just see is it working? Is there a connection there? And then the good news is that the director can come, and sit next to me, and we can have that discussion. Before we have to get on the dubbing stage and spend lots of money to record anything for real. We can test it out on ourselves, and we can interact and we can move it, we can try it 5 seconds earlier, we can take the drums out, we can play the melody backwards, we can get it the way. Both he and i know that we're going to want it. He just enhances the visualization he just brings you to it. He becomes one with it as opposed to, sometimes, i think, score can be a distraction, for me when i'm watching a movie, and all of a sudden, oh, there's a score. Oh yeah, this is a movie instead of an experience, where it all becomes one and it goes together. And that's what the score of this film did for me, which i loved. I mean, it really... it really is one with the film and you don't fell that the score is a distraction. It's a beautiful use of sound there's a scene when Jim Halsey is locked into the police station, after he's been arrested and he goes to sleep, and he starts having a dream, and he's dreaming of picking up John Ryder and when Ryder from his point of view, leans over and knocks on the windshield of the car, It's a sound for several gunshots. The kid wakes up into the police station, and the sell doors open, and he finds that Ryder come in, and shot all the police officers or cut their throats. So, in fact, that... those gunshots had intruded on his dream. That's the sort of subjective stuff. It's a turn on to me, the sounds, how you put the sound of a movie together, because sound goes straight to your heart. It does not go through a filter of you've seen this before, you have never heard anything before like this, because it's always original. I think we previewed the film in New Jersey. -It was all very fine. -There are certain moments, of course, where they scream, and then when Nash dies you can hear people in the audience saying, "it's not going to happen". "Oh, my God." it was so much fun. They were on the chairs. And that's the moment you work for it, to see how it gets there and how it is received, and then you know that you did it right. Some people came over and thought it was a masterpiece. Some people wanted to kill me. I mean, there was a couple of nuns came over to me in theater and say "how dare you show this movie?" and i think it has to do with the realism of the psychology between John Roger and Jim Halsen. It's not a Freddie movie. It's not a candy man movie. It's not a guy in a ski mask with a machete. -That's some kind of fantasy. -The LA Times decided they wanted to do the cover story of the Sunday LA Times Magazine about the movie. And we thought, "wow, that's fantastic." it'll be the cover of it. It's called the calendar section of Los Angeles Times, and we were all interviewed and it was all very positive feeling. It was all very auditory, sort of how effective it is and all kinds of issues. And we're all thinking, this is great, this will be wonderful publicity. And it'll be fantastic. So we all are interviewed, and the day comes for this, front cover story of the LA Times calendar to come out. And i remember opening the paper and looking at the front page of the calendar and thinking: "i must be dreaming", because the headline of the story, on the front page was a large shot of Rutger with his coat blowing in the wind. It was a still from the movie, from what we used to call the Ghost Gas, and this dust storm and Rutgers Long coat. And it was a very evocative shot, but the headline read, "how do these movies get made?" by i forgot her name. And it was basically a story which we all felt we had been thoroughly tricked by this journalist, because there was no hint in her discussion of the question, or what the nature or the take of the story was going to be, that it was, in effect, not even necessarily negative about the movie, but it was a kind of a moralistic quote. These movies, how do these movies get made, that are so horrifying and so frightening? Years later, in fact, it was only about a year ago, when a woman that i met, heard that i'd photographed the Hitch, and she said, "that dreadful film". She said: "how could you have torn that child apart between those trucks?" and i thought, she's sounding like she actually saw it. And i said, but you didn't see that. I said, there was just a fantastic little editing of the accelerator going up and down the clutch, coming in and out, Rudka saying, shoot me, shoot me, and the gun in his forehead, and the kid not being able to shoot, and i said, and then the revving and the clutch, and suddenly the wheel turns and your hear a scream and you go to black. She said, "not at all true." i saw that poor child get torn apart. And i thought to myself, i know what's happened, you closed your eyes and you saw it, in your mind's eye, and when you opened your eyes, we were into the next scene. And for all intents and purposes, she had seen Jennifer Jason Lee torn apart. But you never see it. When Jennifer Jason Lee is torn apart, supposedly the good old indian way, because in the mediaval period they used to do that. And the Indians sort of did some of that, too. Four horses, and there you go. Yeah, we're funny creatures. People always ask me, where's the cut footage of Jennifer Jason Lee being ripped in half? That great makeup effect. And it was never a makeup effect, and it was never in the script. That was never seen on screen either. It was lost screen. It was done actually by sound. And of course, the sound does trick there. The sound of the truck does the trick. You know, 500 horse power, not 4, 500 hundred. The Hitcher is a film that's funny. It's really a film more about how don't show it than how you show it. And people think it's a much more violent film, and it got a tremendous reputation when it came out for being this incredibly violent picture. And there's certainly a lot of violence that happens in it. But i'm not seeing. A lot of it's left to your imagination or it occurs off screen. it's Blade Runners is 22 years ago, this is 15 years ago, but these are to me, they're big moments, because they give you trust. Because if you feel that strong about something, there's something to be found and there's... there's no way or there's no us in fighting it. I think the people who love movies regard the Hitcher as a classic of its kind. And they don't make pictures really like that anymore. The Hitcher is just my kind of movie, man. Good acting, good cinematography, wicked stunts, and a hell of a story. what else do you want? It's now? What? 15 or 16 years later, i still think, i can't believe this is great. It's full of trouble and full of problems, and full of... all kinds of issue, but they're within the confines of a much larger perspective. Wait a second, we're just making movies here. It's not he end of the world. So i'm quite happy about it all.
