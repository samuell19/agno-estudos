Wow, he looks so old now. Know how I remembered him ? How ? From his eyebrows. He sits here every day. Reading the same newspaper, same issue. How are you, Bilal. I"am Egyptian. Do you remember me ? You'd better remember me first. It's Hilal, not Bilal. Take that seat and sit. I'd heard you were visiting. You didn't remember me ? I was the one who did your circumcision, right in my hand ! What are you laughing at him for ? I did yours too ! How are you, Egyptian ? And how's your father ? Uh, Bilal…my dad's dead now. He wanted to return to Egypt to spend his last days here people are so confusing. People emigrate, waste their time outside the country. And then in their last days, they want to come back and be buried. Apparently this country is a huge cemetery. God rest his soul, he was a good man. Now tell me, what will you do ? Get buried here, or there ? I haven't felt good here at all. I decided to leave, go back. Then go ! Who's stopping you ? Are you stopping him, Sayeed ? He's not keeping you here. So go. And you know what ? I'll go too. Peace on you. Don't be upset with him. It's okay, I don't mind. What does he do for a living now ? Like always. He has an old photo studio. Would you like tea, Egyptian ? Ok,, but with "diet" sugar. 2 teas with sugar, on the side ! On the side, I asked for diet. For real, Egyptian, I've missed you. Tell me what I should do in this catastrophe. Don't worry. We'll get your ID, then a passport, then you apply for a visa, then travel immediately. How long do you think that will take ? It's all done on the computer now. Five minutes, and we'll be done with everything. Sayeed, don't rush. I want to take off my sunglasses. You were right. If we keep walking like this, we'll definitely be done in five minutes. Actually…this is just the line for the elevator. The elevator ! Are you sure ? Don't worry. I told you, it's a computer-five minutes and we'll be done. Have a seat, sir, have a seat. I have this form, but I'm in a rush. I want to get a national ID. National ID. Of course, of course, I'm happy to serve you. But this application isn't complete. Would you like to finish it ? Or invite me to tea ? Ok,, whatever, we'll drink tea, but I'm fasting. You want to drink tea ? Sayeed, find someone to make him some tea. How many sugars ? One hundred. Wow. A hundred sugars ? What are you, a horse ? "Tea" means money. A bribe ! No, Barbra ! Ok,, Ok, I get it. So…am I the only one paying this "Barbra", or what ? He means, couldn't you just do it this for God's sake ? I don't work here for God. If you're interested in pleasing God, you can wait at the end of the line. How much is Barbra ? A hundred pounds. End of the line it is. Here you go, ma'am. Say hi to your husband for me. Why are you sweating ? It was raining at the end of the line. Rain is a good omen. Welcome. We need your birth certificate. No worries. We can get it in five minutes. Say hi to your parents. Why don't you consider me a member of the family ? Bring me the military certificate. Don't worry, Egyptian. We can get it in five minutes. The military. We need photos. Four by six size, and make sure your ears are showing. Where do I go to get a snapshot taken ? Hilal, for sure. I said a snapshot, not a circumcision snap. Don't worry, it's just: Whoa. Your cheeks are vibrating. Can you show me 10 minutes ? Wow. Oh, Hilal, pleasemy ears have to be showing clearly. Apparently if I commit a crime they'll recognize my ears. The most important thing in a picture is that you laugh. So laugh. Egyptian, I want to take a picture with you. You really shouldn't be in my ID. Ok,. I have four pictures, four by six size, and my ears are very clear. We need a cosigner. Nine, eight - one at a time Egyptian, slow down. I'm a cosigner and this is a big responsibility. Okay, we're done, it was only nine. What's this ? Why do you look so terrible in your ID ? All Egyptians look that way in their ids. The officer takes the picture without warning. To all of them ? Jeez, you look awful, nobody looks as bad as this. Don't make excuses for it. I can't believe someone would take a picture like this. Only one thing left. We need your educational record. Can we find that with Hilal ? No, we have to get it at the school. Five minutes and we'll be done. Enough, damn it ! The tea's ready. Do you want three or four sugars. No, no, just one sugar on the side, Ok, ? I told you a million times not to wear this. I don't like tight clothing. I wore it for you ! Absolutely not. As long as I'm here, you don't wear attractive clothes, no jeans, no tight shirts. I don't want anyone to be attracted to you. Tea. They're always fighting together. Why don't they just get a divorce. They love each other. Well, maybe they should try to hate each other a bit instead. Maybe that'll stop the fighting. They were going to get married, but now they're engaged. They were living with his mother for months. His brother moved in with them and got married. Tiny house, and Ibtisam had a fight with Monsif's mother. So mom asked her to leave and to come here. And since then, it's me and Monsif and Hamassa in one room. And mom, Ibtisam, and Nosa in the other. And they're still engaged. This button is going to drive me crazy. It doesn't work. Here, show me. No, Sayeed, please. My dad left me this camera before he died, so I really love it. I'm just going to look at it. I won't kill it. "Blease." See, I'm worried after hearing this "blease." I'll look at it once, just once. Hey Sayeed, what the hell ? I said it's the camera my dad left me and you're spitting on it like that ? Ohit works ! What are you looking at ? I'm trying to remember the name of that pipe …what was it ? Oh ! Zerbab ! That was tough. Zerbab ? Are you serious ? It's "mezrab." Here, have some grapes. Do you remember how we used to throw grapes at the people down there, and they'd cuss at us ? I'm going to try it, Ok, ? Take a rotten one. He ate it ? ! Times have changed. But it was rotten. Really rotten. Eat, eat. How can I ? After seeing that ? Why haven't you and Mervat gotten married ? How ? She's teaches English and music at our school. You go to school ? I meant the school we went to when we were kids. Oh, Ok,, Ok,. But, I don't understand. What, did she become ugly once she became a teacher ? She's an English teacher, and I've only got a two year diploma. She's educated. We don't match. So, you just thought and decided on your own that she would never be interested in you. Without even asking her ? I'm positive she'll never think about me that way. Oh, what was her name ? Fadia ? Oh, Nadia, that was it. Mervat. Sayeed ! He looks like a watermelon. Oh, man, that's my bicycle. I wonder where it is now ? Hey Sayeedoh, no, the "cutout" again. Here, let me get you a brick. The brick won't work. This is a different issue. Ok,. You want a salad instead ? Uncle Egyptian, how's it going ? Enough. Monsif ! Monsif, I want to tell you something. I heard you and Ibtisam while you were fighting, okay, and I just felt like there was no real reason for, it's just crap. Crap ? Sorry, I mean, silly little things. You two should just do the whole bride and groom thing already ! Okay ? You understand ? So, I found a solution. Cause clearly, our apartment up there isn't going to work - and if you doyou know. - We're all going to know. So I found a solution. What do you think about taking Ibtisam and traveling ? Go to Paris, Spain, Hawaii ? Oh, yeah, I thought of that too. Was it America that destroyed your morals ? Just think about it. Don't you think that would be better than just staring at her every Wednesday while she washes the floor ? Who told you that ? Sayeed. Sayeed ! Yeah. He told all of us, in the cafe. Just kidding, I'm teasing you. We were talking and he let it slip accidentally. Ok,, I just want to ask you something, and don't take this the wrong way… mind your own business Sorry, I didn't catch that. One more word from you and I'll badmouth your mother in every language in the worst cussing-out you've ever heard in all of America or Egypt. Ok, ? Ok,. Could you move now, so I can get to work ? What, you work here ? You moron. Good morning, Sayeed ! Take Hamassa with you, please ! Come on, Hamassa, let's go. So, Hamassa found a ride. What about us ? The public bus. Two tickets, please. Move in, move in. Go on, go, I'll cover for you ! I've got your back. Sorry, I just can't reach the handrail What's that ? What is that, you, you mister, what is that ? I can't even turn around. Don't turn around or you get a french kiss What ? No ! Run Egyptian ! Run ! Are you okay ? You all right ? Should I get you some water, or are you fasting ? Fasting, fasting. You Ok, ? Move your hands, let me see. It was your own fault. You have to jump in the same direction as the bus, not the opposite. Enough, Sayeed, I'm not going to get a PhD in bus jumping. I'll never take another bus again. Our school. Oh, right ! Wow. School al-nile ! Wasn't the nile river here before ? That was a long time ago. They built the area upbuildings, roads. Mervat serves here. Serves ? Didn't you say she was a teacher ? She serves as a teacher ! Oh, school al-nile, yes ! What do you think ? See how nice it is now that they renovated it ? You mean wrecked it ! This yard used to be so bignow it's tiny. Anyway, I need to go to the bathroom. Where is it ? End of the hallway. Don't let the principal see you. Okay, let's be stealthy. Hey, excuse me. It's actually "very much", not "ferry mutch." Who are you to disturb my "ki-lass" ? ? Kilass ? Oh, shit. Look, let's discuss "ferry" first. Who are you ? ! I'm Egyptian. If you're Egyptian, then why are you arguing with me ? Agiin ? ? No, no, no. I want to know who you are and how you think it's okay to just barge in my kilass. Kilass what, there's no such word as kilass ! You're teaching it wrong ! No, I'm right. Oh, sure, if you're right, then say "vibration". "Fibration", it means shaking. Ok,, say "viking". "Fiking." "Fiking" ? You've totally destroyed that word. Madame Mervat, Mrs. Nevien was wondering if you are giving seminar today ? What is that pollution I'm hearing ? Go tell her that madame Mervat is - tell her she is perfect in English, perfect ! Wait, warda, say "very much". "Ferry mutch." What are you clapping for ? You've spread a disease through the whole school ! How can you do this to the kids ? How ? Oh, you two met ? You know him, Sayeed ? He's Egyptian Arabi. You don't remember her ? This is Mervat ! This is Mervat ? I don't want to remember her. It's bad enough you do. She's teaching the kids wrong, Sayeed. She's an English teacher ! Is she the one teaching your brother ? That's why he's got such amazing skills. Oh, sure. "Seekis. Seekis !" I'm going to the bathroom. the vestiyer is closed for renovation She's amazing in English. Amazing ! Don't be upset with Egyptian. He speaks American, not English. Oh. That's why he was so tense ! Is he coming here to stay or just as a visitor. What did you say ? What was that ? Al-shaacket, al-shaacket ! Shaacket what ? ! You'd better not speak any English at all. Sayeed, no, I can't allow it. Didn't you hear her"fisitor", there's no such word, didn't you hear it ? you're impolite ! This place isn't a school. I'm going to the bathroom. "Fisitor !" Shit ! "Shit" I'm such trash, trash. Ha ! I caught you. What were you doing, huh ? Nothing. I was just saying something to the fence. I heard you say something about garbage. Ok,, let's just go. Just, don't step in the water. The bathroom in the school was closed and there's no bathrooms on the street. What am I supposed to do ? Did you get the educational certificate ? Yeah. We'll receive it tomorrow. Should take five minutes. What do you think of Mervat now that she's grown up ? You mean, after she transformed ! She was saying "shaacket !" I mean - she's like an environmental hazard. Shaacket. Come on. Have a seat, sir. Can I have a minute ? Oh, take your time. How did it go ? Oh, uh, he didn't photograph me. Why ? You know, he said he wasn't in the mood. Egyptian. Show me the ID. Who is that ? It's the soldier who photographed me. Where do I go ? Is this the window for requests ? Go to the office in there ? But there's still a window I haven't been to yet. Come on in, have a seat. Happy ramadan. Barbra says hi. And the same to her. But who is she ? This is Barbra. What ? Take this back. Is this a bribe ? Do you want to get in trouble ? I'm sorry, I assumed - it's okay, I understand. But don't assume that all people are the same. Just for that kindness, I'll double the amount. That's lovely, and thank you, but seriously. Take it back. What's your name. My name'sdo I really need to say it ? You're Egyptian. Why wouldn't you want to say that ? Eh…it's fine. You can say it. Stay here. Five minute and I'll be right back. Five minutes again ? Your passport. My Egyptian passport ! Finally, I'll be able to travel. I love Egypt. I could never abandon her. I love Egypt so much. I don't know why, it's just. - I'll have to come back. I could never leave her. A thousand thanks. You traveling too ? Yeah. Me too. And where are you going ? I'm going to "shifago" to visit my frieds "Shifago ?" Chicago. Shifago. Don't confuse me, please. And you ? Where are you going ? The state of "catafornia". Catafornia. Where's that ? Near the Gibraltar strait. To the north ? Sure, right next to shifago. Doesn't look like you've got any papers. Did you come to get a visa too ? Yeah, but I have a totally different situation. Dude, there's only one situation here. It's all about proof. Proof of where you work, what your salary is... Look. I am actually a computer technician but tweaked it to a computer programmer. And this is the paper I need to prove it. You also need to have a recent bank statement with your name on it. My uncle deposited 80 thousand pounds in there for this. He took it back again after I made the statement, the jerk. So, that's all they need ? No, there's a more important question. They want to make sure you won't leave Egypt forever. What, is there a paper to prove that ? You're not getting it. There's a model answer for that "I love Egypt so much. I don't know why." "Maybe because of the wonderful memories. Maybe because the people are so nice." "Egypt spontaneous like ... a warm spirit" See ? Do that. Is that what you were planning to say, or what ? No, no, my situation's different. They won't ask me those questions. Well, in that case, we're done. Everything is just crap. Everything's wrong. What can we do for you, son ? What am I supposed to do ? I don't understand the people here, and they don't understand me. I feel like it's over. I'm justimprisoned here in this country. Then why did you come, if you thought you'd feel imprisoned ? I just thought Egypt would be the mother of all countries, the spirit, blah, blah, blah. Look, kid, I'm not going to tell you that our country is the best country. And that's its people are the best people. Because maybe there is a country out there better than ours. And people who are better than ours. But at least we're better than some of them. How ? How ? Nobody is happy here. Monsif can't even find a place to live with his wife. And Ibtisam, is she happy ? She can't make herself happy, can't make her husband happy. And Sayeed is thirty years old and still living with his mother because he can't get a good job. And the future will be the same for everyone. Hamassa will be like Sayeed, and Nosa like Ibtisam ! You like this situation ? Tell me you like this situation ! Even if an American can't understand that. Here, we have this concept of "thank God". Sure, if I look at something the way you're looking at it I'd see all the bad things about it. But if you look at the tough circumstances you're talking about with a different view, you might find some beautiful things as well. If you really look around you, you see an incredible community. Look at Sayeed's mothera patient woman, taking care of her son. Looking after him until he's blessed with a better job. And Monsifthis patient man. Despite the difficult situation he's in, he never lost his faith in God. Maybe, like you say, there are lots of beautiful things in America, too. But here in Egypt, we have some things, that are very hard to find anywhere. But here we have this guy sitting in front of us, complaining. I came to Egypt thinking it would be like in my imagination. I lived for twenty years in America, with this picture of it in my mind, so I wouldn't forget it. Twenty years. Dreaming of coming to Egypt and seeing it again. I wish I could just erase this picture. Because now that I've come, I can't see any of that beauty. Ever since I left, it hasn't been worth it. In twenty years, you'd think someone would have told me what it was like. See ? Now you've got an email account. What's that stuff on your head ? Hair rollers. Egyptian. How do you get the camera to zoom in ? Don't try, Sayeed. Why don't we just roll it on the ground ? Did you really need to lend your scooter to Monsif ? People should help each other. Gotta get off here. I'm a professional in bus jumping now ! What the hell, what the hell ? What the heck was that ? My future mother-in-law was being so rude to me. She kept saying "good bye, sssweetie" and she was putting the stress on the "s" sound. Stressing the "s" ? ? Imagine ! Do you know what that means ? No. I'll tell you. When you emphasize the "s", it means good riddance. So that's why I left the house. That's why you left ? No, no, no, no, Ibtisam. I don't think you were right to leave for that. I just couldn't stand it anymore. I blew up at her. Why are you even bothering with that silly lady ? She just said that to irritate you. Why do you care what she said to you ? What should I have done ? Worry about any letters other than "s". Just take care of your own life. Hang out with your husband, wear something green, red, black. Don't come tell me who stressed their "m" or their "a" or "laam alif". What's that all about, come on. Did you notice how I stressed the "s" ? Get up, Egyptian, bring me those dates. Are they good ? They're great. Where are the dates, where are the dates... Listen Egyptian, I want to talk to you. But they need the dates. Those aren't even the dates. Oh. I thought so. This must be them. So what's up ? Sit, why are you rushing ? We're making cookies for the festival. Look, I just wanted to say, I hope you won't be upset with me. You know... tomorrow is Festival And we make peace - but you were also sort of guilty. Me ? Yeah, of course. Why ? You know, when you talked so impolitely about me staring at my wife mopping the floor. You should never have said that. But it was true. How ? You've been doing it again just now, cookie after cookie. I'm an idiot to try and talk to you. Get out of here. Go. Sayeed ? Yes, mom ? Sorry, my mom's calling me. She depends on me a lot. Excuse me. What, mom, what ? Take this tray and take them to the bakery. Why do we have to do all this by hand ? Why don't we just by them premade ? Every year you play that broken record ! Come on, stop being lazy. Take them and go. Fine. Sayeed, wait. Take this. No, I've got money. It's my treat to you. As long as you're here with me, you'll get this present from me. Come on. Take this, Egyptian. Yours. And us ? What about ours ? Look, tomorrow, inshallah. These trays, we're taking them to the bakery ? Yeah, at the end of the street. You know, Sayeed, when I was in America, I asked my dad to take us to Egypt for Festival. But to make me stop asking, he'd give me my Festival gift. Until one Festival, he just forgot and I realized we were never coming back to Egypt. And the treats never had much taste, just like the one your mom gave you. So, don't ever stop taking gifts from your mom, no matter how old you get, or how big your feet get. Don't worry, I accept gifts whether it's Festival or not. What ? That's just firecrackers. This place is nice. But there's a gross smell, don't know what it is... The smell ? That's fish. What ? Don't eat that. That must be rotten. Didn't you put it in the fridge ? This is normal. It's delicious. You mean it's supposed to smell like that ? That's impossible. It's a salted fish. You leave it for a long time, until it gets salty and dark - Sayeed, I don't need to know. Monsif. Monsif ! Could we walk together a bit ? No. Ok,, could we run ? What do you want, Egyptian ? Take this. What's this ? For luck ? No. It's the key to my apartment. But inside, you'll find all the luck you need. Ok, ? An empty apartment, take Ibtisam, live there, and have fun ! Dance, do whatever. You want me to take my wifea respectable womanto an empty apartment ? ? Oh, no, no, of course not, that's wrong. Forget it. Hang on, hang on. Let's talk. Have some more, Egyptian. No thanks, I can't. The smell. Try this. Take it back ! It's clearly gone bad. Your nose is sensitive. This is the best smell ever. No, it's not appetizing at all. It smells like a bloated dead dog. Are you serious ? Eat the bloated dog ! You eat it. Ok,, come on, Ibtisam. What ? Where are you going ? To visit my mom. Why are you taking Ibtisam with you ? I shouldn't go without her, they'll ask for her. We have to say happy Festival to everyone. Ok,, let's go. Excuse me. Listen, Um Sayeed. Yes, Um Mervat ? My daughter Mervatthe history teacher at her school proposed to her. I've got to wash my hands. They smell bad. Mervat, you knowI wanted to tell you something. That there might be someone who wants to tell you something but he doesn't want to because he might be... uh... Your arabic is pretty weak. Speak English and I'll understand you better. I understood that you're expressing your happiness; Why didn't you just say, I am happy ? You haven't eaten anything, Egyptian ! Here, take a piece of this. Oh, I can't. Get in, get in. Nobody saw us. Wow. Egyptian isn't so bad after all. Candles and mango ! Monsifdid you miss me ? I missed you a lot. Haven't you had enough, Egyptian ? My stomach hurts. Impossible. This fish never gave anyone a stomachache. Either you dieor nothing happens. Oh, it's really good. But it still smells nasty. Who's singing this ? Shireen. But she can't be serious. "Drink from the nile ?" But you are drinking from the nile right now. This is water from the nile ? ? ! Looks like your friend isn't used to the water. I heard that, you kelb. This must have been caused by the fish. Egyptian water is perfect. It wouldn't harm Egyptians. Yeah, because their stomachs are abnormal. Why haven't you gone back to your apartment ? Oh, I want to throw up at your place. Where the heck is Monsif ? I miss him. Monsif ! ! I hope you feel better soon, Egyptian. Come on, hamaasa, help me get him to his aparment. No, no, not my apartment, Sayeed, we can't. You guys don't understand - what's this ? What's wrong with him ? Where've you been, i- my mom wasn't feeling very well. Is she better now ? Oh, yes, she's much better. Much better. Ok,, Ok,, hey Monsifcan you get the key to my apartment out of my pocket ? Here, I'll get it - no, no, he knows where it is. This pocket ? Okyou find it ? It was in the little pocket ? Ok,, put it in my other pocket. Good lord, haven't you given enough kisses ? You should get an mri. You should leave. What ? I can't move, I'm sick. Not you, him. Ok,, mom. I made you something good, to help you feel better. Don't you see my stomach ? I can't, I can't drink water or eat anything like that again. Bit by bit you'll get used to it. After your immune system gets used to it, you'll be fine. I'm really thirsty. Am I going to die ? No, no, no, that's just the fish. Fish love water. Ok,, take this, hamaasa, please. Buy me two bottles of water. One for me and one for the fish. From where ? From the shop downstairs. The fish was so good. I don't understand what happened, did it explode in my stomach ? You know, hamaasa ? The difference is huge. Between this bottled water and water from the tap. Totally. But it has kind of a strange taste. Where did you get it from ? From the shop downstairs. Maybe the weird taste is coming from the fish. Oh, right, the change. Keep it, hamaasa. I heard that the Americans went to the moon and put their flag there. Is that true, Egyptian ? Yeah. Why do you ask ? How could the flag be waving when we learned in school that there's no air on the moon ? Mervat. Sayeed. You're crying. Tell her. I can't tell her. I just have two years of education. She won't accept me. Sayeed, don't say that. Sayeed, tell her. And if she accepts, great ! Because you won't have to be worrying about this all the time. And even if she refuses, that's also fine. You know why ? Because you'll be relieved that you showed what was inside of you. Believe me. You'll regret it if you don't tell her, Sayeed. Tell hertell her. Tell her "I love you, Mervat." "I love you Mervat, so much." Tell me, is American beautiful like this ? Of course. There are a lot of beautiful things in America. But, you know, I think the difference might be in the culture. How so ? We have ketchup too. We have what ? Ketchup. All he's thinking about is French fries and ketchup and burgers. Ketchup what, SayeedI said culture ! Here... there's a warmth here. How old is this place ? Next November, it'll be one thousand years old. No, seriously. How old is it ? Seriously, one thousand. A thousand ? Wow. If that's true, this spoon might be older than America. Enough, Egyptian. You're both silly. Rings, anyone ? How much is this American one ? One hundred pounds. What ? It's silver. What, you don't have an Egyptian one ? Yeah, I do. How much ? Twenty-five each. Why, isn't it silver too ? Yeah, it is, but they're not very popular. I'll take one. No, I'll take the Egyptian one. Nice, huh ? I'm full. I'll eat it later. Do you work here every day, or just sometimes ? I've been here every day since before you can remember. Never missed a day. Ten pieces of bread, yeah 3amm. Hi ! How are you, Abeer ? Hi, 3amm Egyptian. Can you hand her 10 pieces of bread ? Here's ten. Don't drop them. My passportwhere did you find it ? Someone dropped it off. Wow. What the... the money's still in here. You're lucky. And my phone, too. No one called me. Now you can go back anytime you want. So he's leaving ? Yes. I booked a ticket. Can I give you a ride on my scooter ? No, Radi's downstairs. You know, I've got my bag with me and everything. Do you think I could take this jallabiya you gave me ? It was really comfortable. You know we'll miss you a lot, Egyptian. I'll miss you a lot too, Um Sayeed. By the waywhat's your actual name, anyway ? My name is Um Sayeed. Then what's Sayeed's name then ? Magda. Ok,, then, take care of your mom, Magda. I'll carry your bag down. You'll find Radi waiting downstairs for me. I just wantedI wanted to give him - I found this money downstairs. - I think it belongs to Sayeed. Get home safely, Egyptian. Noosa. I'll send you emails. I'll be waiting. Hamaasa, give me a hug. Next year you'll be "see-ven," right ? Ibtisam. I'll really miss you. Good bye sssweetie, Ibtisam. Thanks so much. It was nothing, Monsif. Egyptian. Yeah ? Forgive me; I have been refilling your bottles with tap water so -as the old saying goes- You will come back to Egypt That means you owe me alot of money. Take this, Radi, a beans sandwich. It cost me one pounds. Not sixty. You remember that ? You've gotten much more used to this place, Mr. Egyptian ! You've really become Egyptian. Thank you, Radi. Get home safely, Mr. Egyptian. Just call me Egyptian. We're friends. Take this. I insist , it's on me Not a verbal complement this time I'll call you, huh ? Oh, man ! It's you ! They gave you a visa ? No way ! You know the embassy is corrupt. Hey ! How are you, how was your trip ? I'm sure it sucked. No, not at all. The opposite. To tell you the truth, I really enjoyed myself. Really ? But you brought your American passport. It must have sucked. No, I brought it because I missed it and wanted to sit with it a while. No, your trip sucked. Not a lot. A little bit. But you know what ? Egypt has something in it, you know, like ... you knew what it was, when we were talking in the embassy, remember ? tell him What is overwhelming Egypt Dust That's not what you said at the embassy. No, I didn't mean that. I mean, sure, there's a little dust, but- you know, but there's a kind of spirit that'sthat's - evil. No, I didn't mean evil. I meant -you know, the people. You feel like the people are - savages. Okay, maybe there are a few "savage" people. But there are others- thieves. No, for God's sake ! Why are you sitting with me ? Get up, go away ! What the hell ? What a pain in the neck. This camera belongs to you now, Sayeed. I know you wanted to be a pilot, but a photographer is good too. And anyway, you know nobody in Egypt gets to be what he dreamed of. Didn't you say that ? And anyway, if the buttons get stuck, you know how to fix them. And I think Ibtisam and Monsif, rather than staying stuck in that little apartment should live in my apartment. And if the key gets stuck, they can just grease it a little and it will open.

Do you have an medications ? No, this is the first time this has ever happened ! Hold on. Ok,. Hurry up. Captain, there's a passenger who looks really sick. What's his nationality ? He looks Egyptian. Egyptian ? We're already in the air. Just give him something, anything. Are you still in pain ? Yes ! I can't wait for a doctor, I need some air. I need some airlike the air I'm getting from fanning myself with my *american passport*. Captain, the sick passenger is American.
