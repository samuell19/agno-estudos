(ominous music) (bell ringing) (ominous music) - [Narrator] He was born to a family of dirt farmers in Fort Scott, Kansas, worked as a bar room piano player, waiter, cowboy, then Gordon parks picked up a camera and began to take photographs. Changed his life. International recognition as a journalist for Life Magazine, assignments from Paris to Rio from the deep south to the ghettos of Harlem. First Black to direct a major motion picture, The Learning Tree, based on the bestselling novel he wrote about his childhood. More novels, more films, poetry, a piano concerto, a symphony, a ballet, then motion picture scores. All of it, the words, the images, the music, reflect the changing face of America and within it, the hopes and dreams, the joys and sorrows and fears, and inevitably the solidarity that binds us to each other. (light music) (typewriter clacking) At times, especially in the adolescence of my career, I allowed my camera to pass judgment upon people. Without first taking time to understand them. I took refuge in the erroneous adage that a photograph never lies. Since then, I have learned that what a man is, does not always show on the face he wears. Usually there's a deeper truth submerged inside, often imprisoned by his most constant enemy, himself. That truth, for better or for worse, is sometimes the most difficult to find. So few of us manage to even know ourselves in a lifetime. Shifting from course to course, we searched for a hunger to keep us moving, frightened of whatever it is that keeps us so unsure of ourselves. Finally, we fall exhausted. Entangled in a bed of remarkable excuses from which we are unable to extricate ourselves. The premise, the principle that will guide this exploration is not nostalgic remembrance but neither is it Objective reporting. These are fragments. Moments remembered. Several times I have crossed the world and I remember each stone and spring, each flower and century dying with a kind of dying even rivers can't escape. I've been born again and again, always finding something or someone to love, to win or lose, to mourn our celebrate. Now, with life quieting down around me, I look back through an orphaned mind, searching the clear air for the roots of things, at what's growing are expiring along the way. Wherever my feet have taken me, I have found both goodness and pain and that's all I have to give. I could depart with washed hands, keeping the silence and telling nothing but I have no secret doors to hide the memories. ♪ Where grows the learning tree ♪ ♪ The rivers that flow and wind ♪ ♪ Winds that blow ♪ ♪ After sundown ♪ ♪ That's what a boy ♪ ♪ Should love ♪ ♪ Fireflies and restless stars ♪ ♪ In tall fields of corn ♪ ♪ Where all june bugs ♪ ♪ Are born ♪ ♪ In the dew time ♪ I was born to this prairie, to its shifting moods and its wide emptiness and rugged beauty. And when I was a boy out here, I used to lie in this same Indian grass and watch the clouds race their shadows across the hills and the valleys. I know the coyote's howl and the hawk's cry and that river, a mile or so back, used to cool my sunburned days. I used it for looking glass sometimes, and I ended it for meandering off to places that I thought I would never see. Now, this prairie just sits here. Waiting for something apart from the time when wigwam smoke spiraled up in its blue haze skies and red men and white men soaked this grass red with one another's blood. And those hard, cold winters, they were brutal times on this prairie, especially when food got low and nothing was left hanging on the hooks in the slaughter house. When you got caught in a blizzard and the wind driven flakes felt in your face until it was like frozen leather. But tornado time was the worst. The sky suddenly darkened to a frightening stillness that fell all over this land, then the air cooled and you look fearfully toward the southwest for that gray, black cloud. And every living thing out here ate fear of thunder, lightning and wind. The rivers overran their water sides, the bridges broke and the roads washed out, the power lines snapped and we scrambled for the storm cellar. (soft music) And when the wind died and the sky paled and it was clear that the storm had passed, we would climb out of the cellar to watch it spinning on toward the northeast, fierce and beautiful as it went. - I would miss this Kansas land that I was leaving. Wide prairie filled with green and corn stalks, of flowering apple, tall elms and oaks beside the glinting stream. Rivers rolling quiet in long summers of sleepy days for fishing, for swimming, for catching crawdad beneath the rock. Cloud tufts billowing across the round blue sky, butterflies to chase through grass high as the chin. June bugs, swallowtails, red robin and baba link. Nights filled with soft laughter, fireflies and restless stars. The winding sounds of crickets rubbing the dampness from their wings. Silver September rain, orange red brown Octobers and white Decembers with hungry smells of hams and pork butts curing in the smoke house. Yes. All this I would miss along with the fear, the hatred and the violence we blacks had suffered upon this beautiful land. (train whistle blowing) - When I reached there by the A train, Harlem was fully alive. A chill hung in the air and the stoops were filling with Negroes who stood warming in the sun. I walked slowly down the avenue, observing them. They were gathered in groups, their eyes sullen against the morning light. The mood seemed as ugly as their clothing and they looked as if promise had died inside them. The sidewalks were filling too, carrying a steady stream of slow moving people in both directions and soon I was lost in the stream, clothing by Ethel's Beauty Shop and Joe's Burgers and a funeral home and a church of God in Christ and a church of good hope and Smalls Paradise and a funeral parlor and Harlem barbers and Saturday night caskets between the Black and Tan Bar and Ebony Lounge and Pilgrim's Baptist, shine, Mister? Oh, they had cops on every corner looking mean, daddy-o, lookin' mean. Herbs, bibles candles, pictures of Black Jesus, Marty's Pawn Shop and Jog's Place. Thievin' bastards, police, police! (whistle blowing) Police! Sadie's Ball Gowns, half price, dollar down, dollar a week, The Dukes' latest hit, come in, listen, The Mooch, come on in, brother, don't cost you nothing. At African Methodist Episcopal Church and Chick Webb at the Savoy. ♪ What a friend we have in Jesus ♪ Halt, halt, halt or I'll shoot! And police brutality continues in Harlem. Boy murdered, Negro group set for protest. Get your paper here, read all about it, brother. Read all about it. Ads, ads, ads, white waiter wanted. Ads, ads, ads, white plumber needed. Ads, ads, ads, white nurse wanted. Ads, ads, white bartender needed. Can you use me for any kind of work, Mister? Any kind, sweeping, dish washing, window washing, cook, any kind, Mister, any kind? And to you, my friends, throughout the land, as your president, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror, we are stricken by no plague of locusts. Plenty is at our doorstep, shine, Mister, shine? Harlem socialites entertain at the Savoy Ballroom this weekend, dress formal. (chuckling) Ads, ads, ads, Negro mate that can cook, sew, clean and care for two month old baby. Get your Amsterdam News, your Pittsburgh Courier, Chicago Defender here, read your Black papers, get the truth. A Harlem socialite caught in love triangle. Police brutality on the rise, wake up, Harlem! Shine, Mister? Mass rally at 125th Street tonight, come one, come all. Help bury police brutality, high rent, bad housing, starvation, help bury Mr. Ofay tonight at seven and there he was. Old Rastafarian, Old Ras still up on his ladder exhorting the people. (chuckling) Yes, man, yes, man, come on in, come on in. I have something to tell you, man, come on. Yes, come, get closer. No, brothers, let me tell you like it is here in Harlem. All my Black friends who have come to bury the white devil, No, I'm going to tell you something that nobody else has had the guts to tell you in front of these gun totin' cops standing all around you but no, no, no, no, no. I ain't scared of none of them. No matter how big that guns are. The white man's day is coming to an end and we, my friends, are going to push that day along. Yes, yes, we're gonna run 'em out of Harlem as sure as the African is gonna run 'em out of Africa. Mark my word, I am sick of our children being shot down in the streets like dogs by these pasty faced bullies with guns that they make you buy with your own tax money. Listen, you hear what I tell you? I say, you pay for those guns with your own tax money. Wake up, brothers and sisters, wake up! Hey, come on, move in closer, yes, man, let my friends in here. Yes, move in closer, gather around me and hear the truth. Like it's never been told before. How long children, how long will you allow these Ofay bandits to suck your life's blood like leeches? Now, where are your so called Black leaders? Oh, my, tell me, come on, brother, you know? Tell me, where are your so called Black leaders? I'll tell you where they are. They're out in Mr. Ofay's kitchen, begging for a crust of mangy bread and Mr. Ofay says, "Yeah, nigga, yeah, come. Now I gonna give you some bread so you can keep all the rest of these niggas up in spooksville quiet." (chuckling) Yes, yes, yes, sir, yes, sir, Mr. Ofay, yes, sir, Mr. Ofay, I tell you, my friends, I tell you, I tell you, I'll watch over them, Mr. Ofay. I tell you, you and me is going to have to solve our own problems, our own Black hands, 'cause our leaders, pardon my expression, ain't shit. That's it, they ain't shit, right? Right, right, right. All we want is something to eat and a decent place to sleep and some good schools educate our children. Hell, brothers and sisters, that's all we want, right? But the Cotton Club's in Harlem. So why can't a Black man go in there? So the moon is cheese, daddy-o and why can't you eat it? (upbeat music) - [Announcer] Ben Webster. (saxophone playing) - [Narrator] Jazz, according to the Oxford Universal Dictionary on Historical Principles, is the kind of music in syncopated time as played by Negro bands in the United States and music is a fine art concerned with the beauty of form and the expression of thought and feeling. Negro, also nigger, especially a male, is one distinguished by black skin, wooly hair, flat nose and thick protruding lips. Thus defined in this same eminent tome edited by CT Onion, CBE, FBA and other corresponding fellows of the medieval academy of America. Well, question not those lettered fellows of Oxford. Jazz, the meaning of it, is as evasive as silence. Name one who could accurately define this passional art that slices and churns one's senses into so many delicate barbarous and uncomfortable patterns. But alas, for me, one definition would suffice. Jazz, noun, Edward Kennedy Ellington. Also known as Duke, Big Red, Monster, Duke, Duke, Duke 'Em. (jazz music) - [Narrator] Ellington's my hero. Unlike some Black Hollywood stereotypes, he never grinned. Ellington smiled. He never shuffled. He strode. He was always, good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Never, how y'all doin'? At his performances, we young Blacks sat very high, wanting the lights to see us, to know that this handsome, elegant man playing that beautiful, sophisticated music was one of us. (train whistle blowing) - [Narrator] I found her in a notary public's office. I introduced myself. She was a tall, spindly woman with sharp features. We started off awkwardly, neither of us knowing my reason for starting the conversation. At first, it was a meaningless exchange of words. Then as if a dam had broken within her, she began to spill out her life story. It was a pitiful one. She had struggled alone after her mother had died and her father had been killed by a lynch mob. She had gone through high school, married and become pregnant. Her husband was accidentally shot to death two days before their daughter was born. By the time the daughter was 18, she had given birth to two illegitimate children, dying two weeks after the second child's birth. What's more, the first child had been stricken with paralysis a year before its mother died. Now this woman was bringing up these grandchildren on a salary, hardly suitable for one person. Can I photograph you? The question had come out of an elaboration of thoughts. I was escaping the humiliation of not being able to help. She said, "I don't mind." (soft piano music) - 38 years of racism had scratched me raw. Europe was a change and a great relief. Unlike Washington DC, which had disappointed me so, Europe was free of bigotry and discrimination. Traveling from Paris to our house in the south of France was far different from motoring from Minneapolis to Kansas City, where motel after motel would refuse us lodging. No stones had come through our window when we moved into the all white neighborhood. There'd be no emotional outpouring of welcome, drastic calm and unquestioning acceptance. No for white only signs, no need for the weapon I left back in Cherbu. It was a new and enlightening experience. I could never bring myself to say I hated America. I acknowledged her as a great country, but without trembling at her greatness, I damned her at times and without allowing her to consume me with bitterness. The ironic thing about all this is that no country in the world offers a Black the opportunities America does. The sad thing is that America makes it so difficult for Blacks to take advantage of those opportunities. (speaking foreign language) (camera lens shuttering) (bell ringing) I had chosen my camera as a tool of social consciousness. Common sense told me I had to have sufficient understanding of what was right or wrong. Otherwise that camera could eventually become my own enemy. I tried to keep my own consciousness alert and at the highest level of integrity. To those things I would be committing myself to. The problem was clearly defined from the very beginning. It would be hard not to betray myself, to remain faithful to my emotions when facing the controversial issues of black and white. I was a journalist first but I would have to remain aware that being true to my own beliefs counted even more. I would have to bear the anguish of objectivity and try to avoid those intellectual biases that subjectivity can impose upon a reporter. I was a journalist and expected to fulfill the commitment as all journalists are supposed to of emotional detachment. The succeeding years would test my ability to retain that detachment. (shouting) - [Dr. King] Sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood, I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice, I have a dream today. (audience cheering) - Like stone, he sleeps. His voice, relentless, stretched out like a tiger leaping over rooftop and mountain. In noiseless ceremony, he sleeps. His sword's edge, razor sharp with peace and in every man's hand to take proper care of the dream. On and on he sleeps in majestic silence, in slumbering combat, his voice flowing time like water, mustering the forces from the furious quiet of his tomb. Like a thunderous cord, that voice swells and swells to excoriate the enemy. - [Dr. King] When all of God's children, Black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, we are free at last. (audience cheering) It was late. I stood there to the echoing of 100 years back. Suddenly the southland darkness snapped the whip against my grandfather's back. Then clearly I heard him splashing, thrashing in the bayou swamp, his torn feet slowly losing distance between life and 10 baying hounds. For an eternity, it seemed, I stood taking the measure of the hangman's rope, monitoring the stillness or a Black widow's unanswered prayer for the crackling of burning crosses, or that sturdy oak limb bending to dead nigger weight. Star blinked in the north sky. Fire in my stomach warned me on, I had seen enough. Remembered enough. It struck me, as I went that deep, decades deep, beneath the furrows of that moonlit cotton, seeped enough Black blood to paint all of Mississippi a fiery red. - How often have I heard the white man suggest, I know the Negro. Nobody knows the Black man, not even the Black man because all our lives we have cloaked our feelings, bided our time, waited for the hour when we could look our oppressors squarely in the eye and tell them exactly what we think, what we want and intend to get. And all this without fear. Our young people tell us boldly that they will not go on suffering while the white man insists on slow, surrender through law and time. Speak to them about new laws and legislation. They answer, it's one thing to make a law and it's another thing to enforce it. Speak to them about well intentioned whites. They answer, if they are sincere, they will raise their fists and voices above those of the racists. Remind them that times are changing. They answer, we are changing the times. My generation yields to them and finds pride. - [Narrator] I speak of a hero with anger in his heart, with fury in his fist and terror in his sleep. Who Muhammad Ali is, is what he is. And that is as he would say, exactly the way it is. - I am you staring back from a mirror of poverty and despair, of revolt and freedom. Look at me and know that to destroy me is to destroy yourself. You are weary of the long hot summers. I am tired of the long hungered winters. We're not so far apart as it might seem. There is something about both of us that goes deeper than blood or black and white. It is our common search for a better life, a better world. I march now over the same ground that you once marched over. - I fought for the same things you still fight for. My children's needs are the same as your children's. I too am America, America is me. It gave me the only life I've ever known. So I must share in its survival. Look at me. Listen to me. Try to understand my struggle against your racism. Perhaps there is still a chance for us to live in peace beneath these restless skies. - With that awful storm passed, I sometimes think of the Black revolution as a great ship wrecked, lying abandoned on some peaceful shore being gnawed away by the waves of time and change, being looked upon with contempt by those of us who let it die. The struggle against the punishing white sea was fierce. We saw our leaders, like masts on a battered ship snap under the waves of hatred. In the end, it was slaughter, fire and human carnage. (soft music) In this place where all clocks have frozen, these images without heartbeat stare at me with their authority, piercing me with their presence. Here a boy thinks outside himself, his mind slipping at the edges, creeping toward a shoal of darkness. There, a girl whom time has worn, lies anguished on a withered hill, pregnant with a summer full of secrets. Both children of the forgetting day. In these odd moments, love gathered like butterflies on soft beating wings, puzzling moments understood by only those who lived them a heartbeat away from some aging mistress voicing her somber winter song. Good moments, fragile as lilies in their unsoundable meanings and here these instances of common folk with faces that speak of nothing special about their terrible past that is not past. Of those moments without proper names where terror is told in the wrinkled faces and patched coats of old men smothering slowly inside the events of grander men. In this place, I spent a young widow's years, stopping where her has stopped, tending flowers at his morning stone on which her farewell reads-- (speaking foreign language) There I last saw her in black, glaring unforgivingly at me from a landscape of crosses. Now the pendulums swing again. The wind sings over the lowlands and morning birds pack the eaves, twittering away the silence. What will the children do? They will wish to be alone. Where will they go? There will be ample space in the places of old men gone to sleep beneath mountains of dry leaves And there is room, lots of room in the heartbroken houses of young warriors, lying faceless in distant mud fields. Where a violent moment froze them and left them lying there under the black sky music. The clocks are in motion. Time is once more underway. (typewriter clacking) - My son, David Parks, had looked out to where death had overtaken the land of war Where other frightened young men awaited dawn in the terrifying silence. He admitted his fear and I admired him for it. He knew that the casualty list was growing and that the piper was hungry for more pay. All we could do was wait. To hope that this batch of letters would not be his last. - I return the sub hero of a pirate victory. A plunderer of God's precious time. Betrayed by the enemy's scorn for my awesome power. I find that I am just a little warrior, dipping a thimble into a sea of blood and fear where waves grow old and life is small and death is no longer exquisite. History has abandoned me on this savage cliff where those blinded gulls fly overhead, wings, blood soaked with the conflicts of 1,000 battles. I realize now that what happened was not for me. I should have staved off the compulsion to war through such expendable days. I would have better stayed home to tend the cabbages and clip the roses and drink the nectar of another spring. Instead, I took orders and hoisted the banner of my empire and I did as I was told each hour, day and night. That skull, half buried, there in the rubble, and garnished with dead flowers. That's not my doing. My soul is garbed in white. It sings innocence against all past anger. It disclaims, oh scattered cadavers upon that horizon. They say the Holocaust is over now. So wild death with its gargantuan hunger is for the moment out of reach. Let me fill this night with questions. Whose end lies out there in the silvery murk? Where hides the victory that holds up the parade? Our souring wives, where are they? And all the abandoned children, is there no one left to wave our ragged flag? Come, talk with me. Ask me the things that I have suffered. Count the casualties that I brought to one, single barbarous day. Praise the notches in my carbine stock. Then at dawn, let us limp off to pray. - [Narrator] In helping one another, we can ultimately save ourselves. We must give up silent watching and put our commitments into practice. We need miracles now, I'm afraid. If only we could understand the needs of our past, then perhaps we could anticipate our future. We cannot get too comfortable in our houses. Wolves still roam the woods. The hawk still hangs in the air and restless generals still talk of death in their secret rooms. ("Yankee Doodle Dandy") (dramatic music) As for all of us ordinary humans, for a long time, I've entertained the impossibility of putting each one of us into a tiny room, or letting us remain silent for a moment and then separately speak the absolute truth of ourselves. Knowing the smallest lie could hurl us into fiery space. There we might realize how common are needs are. That hunger, hatred, and love are the same wherever we find them, that the Earth, in relation to our time upon it is hardly the size of a grain of sand. Perhaps then, in the justice of understanding, we could escape the past that imprisons us. (typewriter clacking) - Certain people inhabit the darker places, breathing troubled air, foraging rubbish for supper. They say yes even before accusation is put to them. Since those who dare to say no are gone. From sun up until day has vanished, they tramp irrelevant distances, moving aimlessly without sound, singing music no one has until the last they fall exhausted. I watched these people from my house, tormented by their coming and going through hate, through cold and impatient days monitored by clocks without hands or numbers. The rope hangs from their necks. I go from window to window, watching them move in the shadows I moved in. Remembering the darkness that once made my world the size of a raisin. My eyes and heart belong to that time. I still see things in a way that hunger taught me. I feel now as fear instructed me to feel. Asleep at the windows, watching, waking now and then. Knowing certain people should never be left alone even in their dreaming. So that's what it amounts to. Time moving on unwaveringly. One snip of it is unattainable even for one millisecond. Relentlessly, it flows, measuring our dreams before they drop from sight, like slow falling stars. Idly, it wades, flowering love beds and acres of mud soaked red with war. Scorched with our pride and fired with our preoccupations, it marches with the triumph and tragedy we manufacture for ourselves. Immune to our best intentions, it inches forward day and night, authorizing our infirmities and negotiating our wrinkles, until at last, we burn up like used rags and curl into ashes, without breath, sight or sound and time sings on to celebrate our silence. After many snows, I was home again. Time had whittled down to Merry Hills, the great mountains of my childhood. Raging rivers I once swam, trickle now like gentle streams and the wide road curving on to China or Kansas city, or perhaps Calcutta had withered to a crooked path of dust, ending abruptly at the county burying ground. Only the giant who was my father remained the same. 100 strong men strained beneath his coffin when they bore him to his grave. (typewriter clacking) (light music) If I were an old man dying now, I would tell of long cruel winters and just as many cruel springs. Of ages I have watched leaves turn brown and back to green again. Of time, sucking life from older men and breathing despair into infants and I would speak of summers lived through the lash and sickened mobs and I would speak long of a native soil from which I was born to a hostile land and my bent back gave order to that land where I was told to pray and be saved and where I prayed beneath broken flesh, swinging Black from a south tree branch, where I was told to love and conquer and where I loved but bowed to fear and hate. And if I were an old man dying now, I would tell him black jungles where on asphalt metals, smothered in violent summer smoke, frozen under the hawk of long winter. And there in the marked off area of life, I did it each day in the garbage gardens and climbed to fatherless rooms. My hopes compressed between the mean streets and rooftops where the death peddle away. The needle became my rainbow. The needle fed my hungry arms that needed and never stopped needing. Knife and bullet formed my law and plunged me into darker darkness. Jesus, the kindler of my hopes was silent and the last of my patience strained away at the bottom of a stubborn winter. And hung in the stillness left, all I could hear was death shivering through the noiseless wind and if I were an old man dying now, I would not speak lightly of those perils my sons may never have to suffer. Too much was given in each encounter, one that they, in their time, escape such things. Things to be remembered, repeated and remembered then passed on before the candle flamed out, where at a point that I should stop in time and space and be no more. There should begin a brighter flame to burn and mark the place where mine had ended. Then the last flicker of me could endure the approaching darkness. (piano music) What, I asked a wise man once, is beauty? The sun was sinking, he pointed westward saying, "It is useless without valleys to fill." Eastward, the moon was rising. He pointed toward it saying, "It is worthless without meadows to touch. "Beauty is what beauty is wherever it is." That was his answer. I think back to Africa, far out beyond the swamp trees, remembering the beast, black, velvet, black, his eyes searching every leaf, his tail curled against the jungle damp and beauty was this leopard, roaming, the cool green dark. My memory curves to Capistrano, where swallows dip, then shriek out over the wrinkled sea and Theroux's stained light shimmering a silver cross in the dark of an ancient cathedral, where in towering moments, God's men sing his prayers. I recall a bridge of middle-aged grace strung like a harp across a river where men of pleasure sailed and other men worked the fresh rock docks below, craning their scrawny necks, with eyes lifted, to admire the dazzle of a summer sun, strumming the spider web strings. A gull's glorious height, far above those odd voices. Looking at you, I think of a morning room outside Paris, where in the summer mirror, you lay reflected, naked and gold in the nymph light, your slenderness cradled in the bosom of a dream. Do you remember our old shuttered house leaning indifferently down toward the North Hill and the last echelons of wild geese flapping south through autumn wood smoke? Speak to me of rainfalls at dusk and how we walked, hushed, violet beds, listening to the wing brush of cicadas and dogs complaining in the darkening trees. Let your voice run clear as mountain water and turn a spring gone black to rose and green again. (piano music) I journeyed the troubled road well into each shrunken evening, letting the silence of darkness, so cold in the unbroken spell that turned me homeward with a shudder. My memory worrying to the chill of yet another morning on its way. Then, upon one certain dusk, upward through my window, all was black, except a single star of a striking light against that sill. I slept deep that night. The prairie is still in me, in my talk and manners, I suspect. I still sniff the air for rain or snow and I know the loneliness of night. I distrust the wind when things get too quiet. Having been away so long and changed my face so often, I sometimes suspect that this place no longer recognizes me despite this cowboy boots and this western hat and my father's mustache that I wear. It puzzles me that I live so far away from this old clapboard house out here where in the oak shade, I used to sit and dream of what I wanted to become. I always returned here weary. Or to draw strength from this huge silence that surrounds me, knowing now that all I thought was dead is still alive here and that there is warmth here even when the wind blows hard cold. (soft music)
