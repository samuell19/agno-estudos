Hello? Hello? Hello?! Who's speaking? Hello! Yes. Who are you looking for? You. I have the manuscript. Today is a holiday. I do not understand, offices are closed. Be patient, come back next week. Exactly. No one will bother us. Look, I'm leaving, I'm here by chance. I have an appointment. Leave it to me, if you wish. Call me. Leave it to me and call me? You don't understand. What are you doing? What do you want to do? Let's go inside. - Where should we sit? - What do you have in mind? Hurry. Let's go to your office. Where is it? Here we'll be fine. It's very beautiful. Very nice. Nice atmosphere. But there is too much light. It's distracting. Shut the window. All of them. Even these. Come on, hurry! It will be dark then. Are you happy now? Is it all right? Yes, yes, it's very good now. It's perfect. Perfect. It's suffocating. Locked up in here. No air conditioning, it must be 30 degrees today. Sit there, on your chair. There! - What if I do not? - I'll shoot. Let's be clear. Will it be long? I have an appointment, as I told you. People are waiting for me. It does not matter. You're here and you'll stay here. What do I have to do? You must read. Now? - Here? - Now. What are you doing? You are not reading? Come on, read! So. Read! Why? What am I doing? You must read aloud. I have to hear it. Let's turn this off. It's bothering me. That's enough! Don't you think you're going too far? Who are you? What do you want from me? What are you doing? Are you crazy? ... Read! All right. Through the window of a moving car, small hotel signs appeared and disappeared in the clear light of dawn Hotels, guest houses ... ... enlightened by that clear light they had something missing, something magic. And the closed doors conveyed a heavy and lazy stasis. A girl with bright and curious eyes behind the veil, looked out the side window of the taxi. With the careful attention of who is looking for something. She wore an elegant travelling suit, and she had a very feminine grace, between childlike and and naughty. Her name was Anny. I am sorry miss, but I have never heard about this guest house. Are you sure about the name you gave me? - What's the name again? - Desire. Desire Guest House. How odd. What's the street number? 187. So it's further down. Unless it shut down. No, no, I wrote and they responded immediately. I know they are waiting for me. You know, this street is full of guest houses. Look. There's one after the other. It will not be easy to find yours. I do not know what to say, it is the first time I've come to this city. 187, there it is, you were right. - Where is it? - On the other side of the road. - See, we made it! - Thank you. Is anybody in? Is anybody in? You must be Miss Anny. Yes. I wasn't expecting you to get here this early. I could get here only at this time. See, they are already calling me. Let's go check who's calling. Have you had breakfast? At this time there's nobody awake. Except for Mr. Ridolfi. Bonjour madame. Do you ever sleep? Allow me to remind you, madame, that today is Friday. - Yes, yes. - The fourth Friday of the month. It is all ready. I think about you, Ridolfi. You may check. - Here it is. - No worries, God forbid. Are there new comers, new students? No Ridolfi. People come and go at this time of year. You should know by now as you live here as well. The lesson is at 10am. Goodbye madame. I bet you have some talent. For what? Dance, ballet, movement. Le langage Du corps. I believe we'll meet again. But, what does he mean? He's a dance teacher. But he accepts only women as students, and courts them all. He's 'convinced that he is irresistible. A little 'old style no. He may come across as a playboy but in truth, he is a nice person you'll see. I'm sorry I am being so informal with you, you look so familiar. Yes, yes, of course, don't worry. Where are we going? At this time of the morning all rooms need to be cleaned or to tidied up. I don't have one ready for you yet. Let's go to the wardrobe so I can give you a robe. So you can take a nice bath. You must be tired. But, I left all my luggage at the reception. Do not worry about that, we will find all that you need. This guest house is really big! I thought it much smaller! Why? The taxi driver did not know where it was. Actually, they all think it is somewhere else. Ines, move away from there! Next time I see you spying that room I'll make you change your mind. I'll make you not wanting to do that ever again. Stupid bitch. All the rooms need be redone the bathrooms need be cleaned up All breakfasts need be ready. And she wastes her time to spy, like a dirty girl. Move! Go get her luggage and bring it in my room. Do you wish to see yourself what's in there? Come watch. Come. Be careful climbing up. Who is he? He never comes out of his room. He spends nearly all his time in there to train, doing strange exercises, complicated, mysterious. He has tremendous strength. But, is he an athlete? He trains like an athlete. Maybe he's a foreigner. I have never heard him speak. I think he's hiding from something. He's also a bit scary. Did you see his eyes? Is he a regular customer of the guest house? Basically yes. Does he pay like everyone else to stay here? Well, let's say that he reciprocates. In his own way, of course. Here are the bathrobe and towels so you can have a nice bath. Meanwhile, undress if you wish. Should I undress here? You are so shy! Come. Go behind here. Sooner or later I must make up my mind. I need to move the wardrobe at the other end of the guest house. I have to. Why? Ines is always glued to that glass. It's stronger than her will. She can't help it. He never comes out right? Hardly ever, for lunch sometimes. He's odd, I told you. It so messy here. All the laundry still needs to be organised. She's so messy. She can't do a thing. She can't iron either. Plus, she's a bit dumb. Always absent-minded. Something must be wrong in her head! You know, when she first came here, she wasn't like that. She was somebody else altogether. I should have imagined that it would end up like this. How quick! If you wait a moment I finish folding the shirt and then I'll take you to the bathroom. Do not worry, I'll wait. Or I'll go alone. No, alone you couldn't find it. Plus I have to get ready as well. Come with me, come on. Does anyone ever come to see him? Who? The man in the room. The man in the room, the man in the room. What if he saw me? You think he saw you? At one point I looked up and I had the feeling that he was looking at me. It's always the same story. - What story? - Do you want to know something? Maybe I made a mistake in letting you look at him, I shouldn't have let you watch him. Do not you think? Come on, don't be afraid. Do you like it? It's my personal bathroom. I'll leave the towels here. Thank you. By the way, there is no key on the door. But do not be afraid, no one will disturb you. You'll see how relaxed you'll feel! I always do my bath with this. Now you can get in, stay as long as you like. All right. Do you like sweets? I'll get them ready for you. When you're done, come into the kitchen, we'll have breakfast. Do not you dare! Perhaps it is best to unplug the phone. Someone may come here, you know. You will find it closed and will go away. Read. One moment. I want to make her an offer. I'll buy your story. Isn't that why you've come to me? Isn't it what you want? I'll give you a million. Two million. All right two million? Agreed? - I'll sign you a check. - Stop! It is a harmless, book of checks. Do not be afraid. You should be afraid. Now, I'll sign you a nice check. Who should I make it out to? What's your name? Are you trying to buy me? No, to help you. You are a writer, right? You must have other ideas in mind. Other projects. So you will have the opportunity to dedicate time to your... ... work with less worries. You fill in the rest, okay? Done. Now let's wait for the summer to end this is a dead period. Nothing happens. There is no one. Let's talk about this in September. And about other ideas that you'll have in mind. You don't lack of imagination for sure. Now, go back to reading. Go on. No, no. Now the manuscript is mine. I am to decide how and when to read it! that is, to not read it. No! You must read it here in front of me. That's what I like. Go on. Read. The empty corridors and silent seemed to unravel in an elusive geography, suggesting in the light of dawn the feeling of a strange maze where in order to find yourself you had to drop ... ...stones on the ground like Tom Thumb. Hot and with wet hair, Anny leaned on the bathroom door. From the closed rooms in the distance the first indistinct noises could be heard of people waking up. Did you sleep well? Yes. What time is it? I think it's almost ... What do you want? You do not want to answer me? I was looking for the director. And you go around dressed as Little Red Riding Hood? It's not mine, they lent it to me. Who are you? I have never seen you here. Are you a relative of the owner? No, no. I am a customer. It's the first time I have come here. I've just arrived. Then you're new? Yes. The hostess went to wardrobe. Walk along the entire corridor and the wardrobe is right down at the bottom. - You can not go wrong. - Yes. She'll be there. All right. Thank you. Ah, look. By the way. If you see Ines, the waitress. Yes. Tell her to come to me, I need her. Yeah, all right. From Puccini's Tosca, you listened to "And the stars were shining". Miss. Don't you come to have breakfast? It is ready. I was looking for the owner. All is set in the kitchen. But I do not know where the kitchen is. Then come with me, come on. Sit down. Black coffee or latte? Latte, thanks. Have a croissant, they are hot. Good, you made them yourself? Of course I did. She just puts the cream. Who would she be? The owner, my sister. The hostess is your sister? She has got tits. Are you already preparing lunch? Lunch? This is breakfast for the man in the room. He eats so many eggs! Ah, good Anny. You are having breakfast, after that hot bath you must be hungry. What are you doing there? The rooms need to be tidied up. You know it. Go, I got it. Have you eaten enough? Yes thank you. Then we can take it away. It's Turkish coffee, would you like some? I've never tried it. Taste it! But, it looks like sand. Coffee grounds. You know, people read it as a fortune-teller. Give it to me. A veil falling. No, it's being torn apart. A tear. A sword. There's a woman. A young woman. Try to look at it too. But, I do not see anything. Look more carefully. They are calling me from the reception let's see who it is. The girls, for sure. Good morning madam. - Good morning girls. - Good morning. - How are you today girls? - Fine thanks. Has Ridolfi already arrived? Ridolfi was already here at seven. And the others are downstairs? They are waiting outside. I go with the girls, you go get dressed. Then we'll arrange for your room. Let's go. Quiet, we're not in a boarding school! Let's go. Where's the suit? Who took it? Your room is very nice. Come here. Do not make noise. A moment, let me close the door. Someone could walk in. Do I like you? Yes... Take off your clothes too. I'll help you. You know how to play? - Do you play horse riding? - Yes. One. Two three four. Up, up, three, four. One two three four. The arms, the arms. Five, six, seven, eight. Faster, faster, three, four. One two three four. One two three four. Up, up, three, four. Relève. Two three four. The arms, the arms. One two three four. One two three four. One two three four. Time, two, three, four. Come on girls, let's move on. One two three four. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, chest out. Three four. Five, six, seven, eight. one, two, stretch it, stretch it! Soft, softer. Down, slowly that leg. Again. Elegant, smiling. Ready, ready. Five, six, seven, eight. Five, six, seven, eight. One two three four. One two three four. One two three four. Five, six, seven, eight. Position. All at the centre, seven eight. And one two three. Forward. Forward. At the bar. So one of you. You come. Ah, I'm really tired. I was not in shape, at all! Ah, you're here Anny. I was waiting for you. Sorry, I heard noises and ... Here's your suit, go wear it and join us in the dining room. Do I have to get dressed here? It 's true, I haven't given you your room yet. Come with me. Number 32 is free. You can go there. Here is the key. I was waiting for you. What? Come on, come on. Well, I ... I made you come to my room, because I intercepted the letter he wrote, you know who. What letter? You know what I mean. Banishment! Oh no, do not do it, I beg you. If I will not, if I do not ask your expulsion, then I will punish you very hard. All you want. But you will not tell anyone. Never. Get up, get close. Are you afraid of this? Yes. No. You should not. Because this is our friend. It helps us be pure. You should be afraid of your own body. Yet you aren't. What's the size of your chest? - I do not know. - Yes you do. You know very well! You must not lie! Not to me. You touch yourself? No. Get undressed. The body unleashed, is like an animal without education. It wants, it demands! It claims! Kneel down. Now tell me. How do you call it? What? Do not be stupid, you understand very well. I do not know. With your friends, how do you call it? Really... And do you touch it? Answer! Sometimes. Further down, down. Tell me now. Did he touch you? Did he touch you? Yes. And you? Where? Where? I do not know, I won't say it. You don't know it... You do not know... But you do. Confess! The letter says everything. I want to know everything. Did it please you? How did you feel? You must not hide anything. You must confess everything. Do not make your situation worse. Put aside pride, modesty, it is useless. Open yourself unconditionally, be free. And thus regaining your innocence, your purity. Convince yourself. The body is our enemy. Yet you give in to it. You let it expand. Confess. Tell the obscenities, the impure thoughts, everything. Don't respect your enemy. Choke it. Destroy it. Destroy it. Oh God, what exhaustion. I know. Look ... ... Can I stand up now? Was there lust? A ...rather immature lust, I mean. I... ... I think that with this hot weather, perhaps we should only read the script. Agreed? I make decisions here. From time to time. And according to my mood. Okay okay. As you wish. I do not understand, it's amazing how you handle this heat. I love the heat. The sweat. Exhaustion. And the flies that buzz around. Like an obsession. I do not remember that in Visconti's film flies were buzzing around. Do not be funny. I just wanted to suggest an image. Read. My throat is drying up. Yes, it's hot here. On the other hand. On the other hand, there is air conditioning. - Do not you think? - No! It disturbs the reading. It bothers me. The dining room of the guest house had something ... Let's have something cold to drink. You will not find much there. What do you offer your writers? Contracts. Do not you think it's enough? And champagne. Everything is OK. Who knows how long it's been in there. Perhaps this is the right opportunity. Do you think it's the right timing? It's nice and chilled. Lucky charm! Prosit. Do you want to know who you look like? Tell me. Like the fatherly character of my story. The man shaving in front of the mirror. And the maid. Did you really think of him looking like me? Not exactly. But now yes. Maybe a little less fatherly. It's fine. Now let's continue to read. Okay. A moment, wait. What's wrong? No dark anymore? I'll follow you from here. What do you intend to do? I can wait. Weren't you in a hurry? Come on, start. If you read aloud I will hear you perfectly. Keep sitting on the couch. Do not try to be smart I can see you. I see, I see. Page 127 second paragraph. The dining room of the guest house had a feeling of old and family. It looked like the dining room of a well off house, with solid and dark furniture. And with a large table in the centre of the room. There were paintings on the walls and ornamental plants. The environment was full of warmth reserved for customers of some special guest houses. When Anny appeared a bit lost in the doorway she found all the other guests seated at the table. Sorry. I'm sorry, maybe I am late. Do not even mention it. Come, come Anny don't worry. You are free to eat whenever you feel hungry, come sit. This is Anny. Lucky to meet you. Pleasure. Enchante. Now Ines will take care of you. Everything is ready. She'll serve you right away. We're almost done. But do not worry. We are happy to keep you company. At the end of lunch we like to linger at the table. To taste some sweets, to chat away. It's a good habit of this guest house. You will like it. You will see. Enough, Ines. How long will Miss Anny wait to be served? Come on! She enjoys serving. It's like walking on a catwalk for her. It's her moment of glory. She's young. Exuberant. You have to understand her. Today steak and green beans. It's really good. It looks delicious. I see you have appetite. Yes, I am very hungry. Today I did not have a moment of rest. But now you will have your own room. Right, Ines? Ines! Hurry up. You have to tidy up room 32! Go! Shall we listen to some music? Ah, yes, yes. Let's listen to some music. The music helps digest. Do you mind? No, no, absolutely. Come on! Let's celebrate this beautiful lady who came to stay with us. These are old records of the house. Always the same ones. How long had she slept? Anny paused for a moment in a sort of indolent drowsiness, still inhabited by the last excited images of that short dream. The girl had been ... ... she had been brought back to reality by the intrusive traffic noise that was now intensifying around her. But what happened? What would this news mean? Didn't you have to shoot me? Instead I shot Anny. This story does not interest me anymore. You are right. We repeated it too many times. Maybe it's not as exciting as the beginning. We know it by heart. You should write a new one. I do not know, a different situation. You don't enjoy it anymore? Yes, yes, very much. But I am saying this for you. You're so good. Try to write another one. Another story? Even a simple thing. What do you mean? Nothing, you're the writer. It is up to you. Exactly. It will be a surprise.
