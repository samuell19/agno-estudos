But in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union. Thank you, thank you. So, next week we're going to be starting Steinbeck's 'Of Mice and Men'. Which I think you will love. Thank you. Gemma! Thank you. How's the audio book? Do you know, there's not one single laugh in the Psalms? Not one. Shock me. At least it pays the bills. Yeah well, it certainly helps. Thank you! - Bye! - Yeah, bye. One Joel sized dinner is served! Just putting pajamas on. What time is Charlie coming? After you have eaten your chocolate milk. And drunk your spaghetti! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Alright, out you get. It's my turn. I'll do it. You sure? You had to listen to Howard's anecdotes all night. So did you. Yeah, but he's my boss. Now are you sure you're not just offering because you have a thing for the babysitter? Well that might be it. Okay, I'll do a couple of lengths and I shall wait up for you. Okay. - Hello. - Hi, he's fine. - Great. - Goodnight! Can I have a drink of water? Yes of course you can, darling. Bugger. Listen to my voice, my king and my God, for to you do I pray. Listen to my voice, my king and my God, for to you do I pray. For you are not a god who takes pleasure in evil. Hello Mrs. Shields. Hello, didn't hear you come in. No idea why they chose me for this job. They chose you because you have a very, very, persuasive voice... Thank you. Get off! Where's Joel? He's in bed! He's not in his room. Joel! Joel? Joel? Joel? Joel! He's not here, he's not here. Joel! Joel! Joel! Joel? Please help us, we can't find our son. - Yeah... Police please. - Tell them he might've been taken. - Tell them he might've been taken! - Yes, yes. Joel? Okay. JOEL!!! JOEL!!! I think we should move. Gem... Let's not make any quick decisions, okay? Okay. I'll do it. When did this come off? Last week. He wanted to surprise you. God, your hand... It's nothing. Don't let me enemies gloat, saying we have defeated him. Don't let them rejoice at my downfall. But I trust in your unfailing love. I will rejoice because you have rescued me. I will sing to the Lord because he is good to me. Psalm 14. Only fools say in their hearts there is no God. They are corrupt, and... Will? I love you, Mummy. I love you, Mummy. Hello? Hello? Can you help me? Stop it, please! Stop it. You okay? I can't see properly. Let's get you off the road. Come on, I've parked just here. Light. Light, yes, but blurry. I can't focus on anything. Okay well, doesn't seem to be anything physically wrong with your eyes, but we'll do an MRI just to be safe. Someone's gonna need to fill a form out for you. I"ll do it. Well, you won't know what you're signing. I'll read it out to her. - Who are you? - Paul found me and brought me in. I couldn't leave you alone on the street. And you'll read the whole thing out to her? - Yes, of course. - Fine. What's your prognosis? You a doctor? Well, I've got some medical training. Could she be malingering? Why on Earth would she do that? So let's do an MRI. Okay, we're bringing you out now. - Hey. - Will! - I'm here. - Where were you? I'm here now, it's okay. This will hurt a little, it's an injection into the muscle in your shoulder. - Aaagh! - Good, all done. Yes... it's coming back. Hello beautiful. Okay look at me please. And... how many fingers? Seven? Two. Six. Ten. Okay good, and follow my finger. Where's Paul? He left before I got here. He asked us to give you this. Okay, what you had is a form of panic attack, it's quite rare. Not malingering then? It's called Amaurosis. It's more common in one eye but loss of sight or distortion in both is not unheard of. Have you had anything like this before? No, never. What was the injection? That's Lorazepam, it's a quick acting sedative. Well it did the trick. I'd like to recommend a psychiatric evaluation. There's no need. Please thank your staff. I spoke to your husband during the MRI. Given your history, Mrs. Sheilds, I really think you should speak to someone. It's the first fish we bought. I miss you... Here's a picture of you and little Dub Dub. You got him for your birthday, you were four... Little Dub Dub's still here. Mummy forgot to feed him one day, didn't she. She just forgot. You remembered... You're so clever. Be careful! I said be careful! Will? That's mine. Gem! - It's Paul... - Who? The life saver. I should have called to say thank you. Don't worry about it. This all looks professional. Gem does audio books. She's brilliant. It's pretty cool. What do you do? I was a pharmacist. Til about five years ago when it went corporate. We thought we'd get out and live the dream. Lucky you. And the dream is? We inherited a small estate in the lakes. Wow. Yeah, it's a bit tired at the moment, but we're renovating it in time and... we've got a small cottage in some of it's already ready, the main house, which we hire out for weddings, and well, anyone who pays, really. We lost our son. Yeah, you showed me his room. Do you want to see a photo? Sure. That was just a couple of weeks ago. Yeah, he's very handsome. Sorry. It's okay. He's in heaven now. Heaven? Of course. What, he's here one minute and then just gone? Just nothing? Yes... sadly, yes. Well fuck that, Gemma. I'm intruding. Listen, if you guys ever wanna get away from it all, the guest house is already finished. It's right by the Lake. If you're interested. It's okay, I've got the old one. Take one anyway. I love you, Mummy. Call home. Hi! Where are you? I'll be back in ten minutes, I've got a surprise for you. Do you remember that baker on Landsdown street? Chocolate donuts... You like donuts Paul? What, Paul's there? I'm just leaving. Dropped in a brochure. Take a look. Keep well, both of you. Bye... Why did you take the batteries out? It woke me up, it scared me. I still need to listen to him. I know. I love you, mummy. Can't see. God... Don't brake! - Can't see. - Gemma, slowly change lanes. God! You got really lucky. Yeah, I'm really lucky. You have minor whiplash. It could have been much worse. You made a mistake, Gem. Could have just as easily been me. You blame me. You nearly died out there today. Do you understand that? - Yes. - Really? You think that's a small thing, do you? Do you have any idea how much I love you? They said they can give you two pills, the same as this sedative stuff. You take it every day and it stops these panic attacks. But you come in and you talk to someone every week. And you get better. You get better. You coming in? Not yet. What's that doing there? I put it there. I'm having therapy and I'm taking the damn pills. Good. Look, why don't we go away. Might do us both some good, we could take up Paul's offer for the weekend. No. I thought you liked the idea. I changed my mind, okay? Sure. Thank you. Gem... Yes? I hear him. Will... In his room. I hear him. When? At night. Sometimes during the day. You don't believe me. What does he say? He says he loves me. Your mind is playing tricks on you. I swear. I hear him. Come with me. He's still here, Gem. Isn't that the most important thing? He's still here. I stayed awake all night. Nothing. Okay, thank you Howard. Thanks, we'll be in touch. Okay, bye. He thinks it's a great idea. Take as much time as you want. We don't even know them. But it's a guest house. We don't need to know them. You really, really wanna go? Yeah. Yes, I do. Get rid of all the clutter. Fine. If he's got space, let's go. I'lll email him. What shall I say? Tomorrow? Will what are you doing? Stop it, Will, no! AAAGH!!! Joel? Did you see him? No. Give me five minutes. Here. Can't hurt. Dear God, we pray for our little boy, Joel. Look after him and keep him safe. Now and forever more, may he rest in peace. Do you want me to take over? Who just puked up in that church, you or me? Okay. I'm fine. GPS is gone. Nearly there. Hello? Paul? Hey, my first guests! It's beautiful! Well, I said you'd get away from it all. - Paul. - Hi! You did all this? No, Elise designed it all years ago, I just hired a contractor. Elise? Yeah, my wife. Where is she? She's not living here at the moment. Right. Think we're all done up here. I printed out a list of anything you might need, but any problems, just up the path. And I got you an official welcome pack. Thanks very much. Where are the pans? Bugger... I'll just nip into town and get you some. Town being the place we passed thirty minutes ago? Yeah, no problem there. No, no, we'll manage tonight. It's okay. Well, I got some steak I was gonna cook, you could share that. Thanks, but... Yes, yes, that would be lovely, thank you. Great, I'll see you soon. There's no way I'm not asking him. Just be diplomatic. Your version of diplomatic, or mine? Mine. Use this entrance, come on in. This is lovely. It's quiet, that's for sure. How do you like them? Medium rare. Medium rare it is. Will? Yes? Thanks. Do you have any wifi? That's the reason it's so quiet. How about a phone signal? I'll show you. I've tried every provider. They're all as bad as each other, I'm afraid. I like to think it adds to the charm of the place. Right, just this way. Bit of a climb, but if you do need to make a call, this is the only place. You're welcome up here anytime you like. Here should work, most of the time. Give it a go. So... What happened to Mrs. Paul? Who? Elise. She moved out for a while. Like I said, I... I hope it's temporary. Hey Paul? What do you for entertainment around here? Wanna attract the holiday crowd, you're gonna need more than a pretty sunset. Well, you got the lake on your doorstep. Access to the boat full time, there's salmon fishing in the river just over the hill. Shooting? No. Anyone like coffee? Decaf? - Sure. - Not for me. So fishing... And walking. Well if people wanna come, it's up to them. I figured it'd be a break from all the craziness out there. And if not, well... got more than enough to keep me busy. Like what? A ring but no wife? Not just now. No wifi, no wifey. No guests, apart from us. So seriously... Like what? Look I'll give you all the space you need. I value my privacy just as much as you value yours. We understand. Do you? I'm sorry about that. No, no, I'm sorry. I should have been clear about Elise before you guys came. No, no, it's okay. Both been through enough hell with Joel without any more surprises. He thought he saw him in the village today. I'm sorry. I can't lose Will too. Of course not. Now, you'll get peace and quiet and rest here. I'll stay out of your way. Okay, I'm falling asleep here. Yes, they put you on medication? Lorazepam would be the obvious choice. Yeah. What dose? 0.5 milligrams, two in the morning. That'll be why you're drowsy. Try taking just one. And see how you go. Any problems, you let me know, okay? Thanks Doc. Gem? Gem? Come on. Come! Some inheritance. Come on. You've got to see this. The things you could do with this place. This is his private space. I know. We're snooping. Door was open though. That's his room. Another bedroom here. Come in here. Come on, come on. Look... He's a bird watcher. A fucking bird watcher. So? So? All day long, out there somewhere, waiting, watching, waiting for some chick to hatch. Very fucking interesting. No wonder his wife ran off. Come on, let's go. I thought you'd be interested. Did you hear anything last night? No. Well that's great. He's back. Watch your step, it's very slippery on here. Hey, you can pass it onto me. - Thanks. - I hope I got enough. It's three days. Yeah, maybe I overdid it? You sleep well? - Yes. - No. No, no, it's okay Paul. We'll do that thanks. Sure. - What? - This. It's breathtaking. He'd have hated it though. Yeah. I remember one time I took him to Alderley Edge. He wouldn't even get out of the car. Another time, I don't know if you were there, he made me hold him by the ankles all the way to the post box. Doing the wheelbarrow. He hated walking. Do you ever wonder if we did something to deserve this? No, I never wonder that. Like what? Sin. Maybe we're being punished. - For what? - I don't know. You think we did something to justify losing Joel? Come on, let's go back. No, I want to stay here for a minute. Will. Will? Will! I can't see. I can't see. Shh, I'm here. You alright? I only took one pill. Why would you do that? I wanted to see if I was okay. But you're not! The next time you decide to change your own dose, ask someone who knows. I feel so stupid, I'm blind on a fucking cliff top. Legs. I think we should go home. Please can you just get me a pill? I'll be fine. I just need to rest. Hi, I... I saw you coming down the path, is everything okay? I cut back on my pills, and it's my fault. I'm so sorry. Here you go. I think I should start packing. You're leaving? I hope so. Okay, well, no need to rush into anything, just let me know. Paul! If we were to leave, what's the best way to settle up? You must really miss being home. I hear him. Who? Joel. In his room. At home. I can imagine that's very painful for you. It's... It's comforting. You do what's best for both of you. We'll let you know later. If that's okay? Yeah. Rubbish. What do you think? I think you need more practice. Yep, I do. Hi... Can we, can we stay another couple of nights? If that's okay. Can we be flexible? It's January. Thanks. Will's exhausted. Keeps himself awake at night. Listening for your boy? Yeah, he's torturing himself. Well, I can't force him to sleep. Hang on. Here, try a couple of these. They're tasteless, dissolve in hot or cold liquid. I think a good night's sleep will really help him. Thank you. - Really, thank you. - Okay. Talk to me. Talk to me. My boy... Hello? It's open! Come on up! Hi. How was last night? He's still sleeping, thanks. Do you mind if I call a cab? No, go ahead. Right, now, should get a signal Dave. It's Himesh. Where can I find an electronics store? I need a microphone for my laptop. Yeah, passenger wants a microphone for her laptop. Yes, brilliant. Alright, thanks mate. So there's a high spec camera store in town. Okay, worth a try. I'll see you back here in an hour? - Okay. - Thanks. Excuse me! Hi, sorry, I think, I think this milk's off. - Let me change it. - Thank you, thanks. Can you turn your engine off please? Please stop. Please, please... Stop! Stop, no! - Sorry... - What are you doing? Sorry, I made a mistake. Sorry, I'm so sorry. Everything okay? Yeah. Did you get what you Yes, I did thanks. need? Excellent. Scenic route? Pardon? Quick route, or scenic route? - Beautiful, isn't it? - Yeah. I got married last week. Congratulations. Thanks. You got children? Miss? You got kids? No. We're trying straight away. In fact, I bought a test earlier. A test? I couldn't decide. Could I buy one of those from you? What, really? If you don't mind. So you're... You'll be happy then? Of course. Well, then, you've got to take one. There we go. Well, I pray it works out for you. I hope it works out for you, too. - Will? - You okay? Yeah... yes thanks. Paul? - Hi Gem. - Will where are you? Back home. Can you imagine what it must be like to be reaching out to us, and we've left him? Will, I heard the noise again in the town. It was just a little girl on a bicycle. It wasn't him. I'll come back and get you right now, but I need to be with him. No, no it's okay. I'm gonna stay and work for a couple of days. Okay, that's fine Gem, really. You should call me anytime. I'll be right here. I love you. Everything okay? Dropped your phone... Will's gone back home. I'll stay for a couple of nights, if that's okay? If you like. What about in here? Perfect. Okay, have fun. I'll see you around. I love you mummy. Can I get you a drink? No. Thanks. What can I do for you? Can I borrow your car? You are joking... Please. You're having panic attacks and they're messing with your vision, you shouldn't be anywhere near a car. - Look, I'll be back in the morning. - No! I'm fine now, I've taken two pills, please. It's important or I really wouldn't ask. I need to go back home. Okay. Pay for any scratches, okay? Will do. Drive carefully, stay calm. Hello? You've gotta stop taking that Lorazepam completely. What? It's okay for you, but it's really not okay for your baby. How do you know about that? What difference does it make? I saw the box. Jesus. I have to clean the cottage. Look... This is important, Gemma. It's dangerous for your baby, especially in the first term. Thanks. But it's really none of your business. I've got to go. No, no, no, listen to me, listen to me Gemma... Will? Will? Will? My God... Shhh!!! You scared him off. Why would you do that? Let's see what he thinks about the new Joel. How do you know? He told me. Who? Joel. But he's dead... Shhh!!! He can hear you. He won't tell me why he's still here. But he might tell you. Try saying sorry! Joel are you there? Joel, I'm so sorry. Joel, it's Mummy. It's Mummy. I'm here. I'm sorry Joel. Talk to me. Talk to me Joel, and tell me what to do. Please, Joel, tell me what I can do. God!!! My God... God!!! Hi. Is everything okay? Yes. - Will didn't come back with you? - No. - Is he okay? - Yep. Sorry, I just came to ask for my car keys back. Of course. It's okay. Why did you call Will last night? I didn't. To stop me from taking the pills? You know, I don't mind listening to your advice, but you really shouldn't have called him. No. Paul... you did. Look, I lent you my keys. I thought I was helping out and that's it. You know, you came down here to relax, you should give it a go. Yes, well, bird watching's not really my thing. I don't watch... Here, put these on. Paul... Turn it off. Please, turn it off. What's up? It's the music. Just turn it off! How many pills did you take? - None. - Good. You told me not to because of the baby. Okay breathe... Breathe... Try and fight against it. Deep breaths. It's coming back. It's coming back. Yes, I can see now. I can see now. You really don't need to walk me back. - You're hilarious. - What? I know I don't need to, obviously I don't need to, I'm just doing the right thing. Elise always liked to be escorted. She loved the attention. Have you heard from her? Yeah... She's not coming back. So... Well look, I'm... I owe you for the steak. I must warn you, I'm a crap cook. I'm sure you're not, but I'm not very good company at the moment. Okay, of course. Listen, I'll be fine from here, honestly. You sure? I love you Mummy. I love you, Mummy. I love you, Mummy. Where are you? Joel. Joel. Where's Daddy? Joel? Baby? Baby? Baby, where are you? - I'm here. - Baby, where are you? I can hear you. Come with me, baby, I can hear you. I can hear you baby, I can hear you. I can hear you! Paul! Paul! Paul! Gemma? What happened? I heard Joel! Okay, let's get you inside, let's get you inside. I heard him, I heard him. Come inside. In here. Joel? There's no one here, Gemma. I heard him. You can talk yourself out of it if you calm down. I need to go home. Not until you get your sight back. Now! I need to see Will. Now! Okay, okay let's go. Get some sleep. When you wake, I'll take you home. Give me my pills. I can't Gemma, I can't. Give me my fucking pills. Alright, one, one. Where are they? They're in my jeans in the bathroom. Here you are. Go, just go, please. I'll check on you later, okay? Joel, are you there? I love you so much, Joel. And I'm listening. I'm listening. Joel? Joel can you hear me? I won't be long. Come on, Will. Come on, Will. Come on, Will. Come on, Will. Will? How'd he get like this? He jumped me the second I walked in. Crazy like a horse. I wanted to bring him to you. I gave him a pretty heavy dose of sedative. I had no choice. He can have Elise's room til he wakes. He'll be fine in a couple of hours. Can you just go, please. Just go! I'll be around if you need anything. I am so sorry, I didn't believe you. But we're all together now. I'll be back. Psalm 69. Save me, God. The flood waters are up to my neck. Deeper and deeper I sink into the mire. I can't find a foothold. I'm in deep water and the flood's overwhelming. I am exhausted from crying for help, my throat is parched. My eyes are swollen with weeping, waiting for my God to help me. Don't let me sink any deeper. Save me from those who hate me. Will, wake up. Answer me quickly, for I am in deep trouble. Come and redeem me, free me from my enemies. You know of my shame, scorn and disgrace. You see all that my enemies are doing. Their insults have broken my heart. And I am in despair. If only one person would show some pity, if only one would turn and comfort me. But instead, they give me poison for food. They offer me sour wine for my thirst. I love you, Mummy. No, not again... Paul! Paul! What happened? What do you think happened? Okay, okay, let's get you back. Let's get you back, this way, come on. Just through here, that's it. What will Will think? Wandering around in this state? I know. I've got to beat this, and I will. I will. Can you pass me my clothes, please, I need to get changed. Yeah, there's some just here, there's a pair of jeans. And a top for you. Thanks. Cup of tea? Please. How's Will? Paul, are you there? Paul? Paul! Paul? Hi, did you want something? Yeah, I'm hungry. Okay, I can cook. Great, what have you got? - Bacon, eggs. - Smoked salmon! No, sorry. And Ben and Jerry's ice cream, any flavor. I'll do my best. It's a very specific craving. Smoked salmon and chocolate ice cream. You said any flavor. You call this looking after me? Sure, we can go get some later. But I want it now. Okay, I'll... just check in on Will before I go. Who are you kidding... Will, wake up! Wake up! Can you wake up? You bastard. - Hello? - Hello, Himesh? Can you... Fuck... Fuck! Paul? Paul! Why are you up here? I need to be with Will. Did you get any ice cream? Forgot my wallet. Please, take me to him. I'm gonna stay here with him. Can you pack up my things and bring them over? Instead of ice cream? Yes. Leave it to me. Hi, if you want to leave a message for Will or Gemma... And Joel! Please speak after the tone. Steady. You're back! I think I got everything. I'll go and get lunch sorted. - Ughhh... - Will? It's good, means he's coming around. I'm sure he'll wake soon. I hope so. Well... Looks like you can see okay now... Fuck you! Hello, my name is Edward Bear. I recorded over the old message. I'm not scary. I'm not scary. Say something. I'm not scared. You know, Elise left because of you. I doubt it. I heard you on the radio, reading poetry. So I ordered some audio book you made. Some... chick lit nonsense, but... You brought the mediocre to life. You were magnificent. Anyway, I went to the bookstore, and saw you. Became a habit. Weekly fix of... Extraordinary pleasure. When Elise found out, she left. She said I was obsessive. Which I am. And now you're here. You haven't flown off. I love this. You can fight it. Can you stop it? Can't be easy getting over what you did to Joel. It was an accident. You messed up. Please, switch it off. What do you want? I don't know. I'm winging all this to be with you. Baby will need a father figure. It has a father. Of course it does. What would she do without you, Will? - Goodbye, Will. - Will! Aaagh! You're pathetic! I have lost my child. I thought I lost my mind. But I am not losing him as well. Not to you. Hello? In here! Did you call me? It sounded like... We're going to the police station. Can you stay here for a minute and then help me carry him to your car? What about him? Shout at him and he'll run, he's harmless. Get away from him. I want you to stay. Please. Move! Shhh... I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you. I just want what's best... for you and the baby... Are we even now? No! Come on, let's go, let's go! Gem. Gem! I'm okay... He bugged our house. He must have been listening on us for months. Not just listening. He recorded us. What did he want? Me. Us. He sat up here in his house and listened in on our life. The 17th, it's here. Gem, no. One Joel sized dinner is served. Just putting pajamas on! Close it, Gem! After you've eaten your chocolate milk... For God's sake close it! God... Can you see, Gem? Can you see? Fuck it. Will? I'm going to finish him. No! No, Will, let the police deal with it. Will, please, don't leave me here! Will! We can call them from the garage. You're right. Can I have a drink of water? Yes, of course you can darling. The bastard! He was playing back Joel's voice to me in Joel's room. And all this time he was gone, just gone. No heaven, no angels, nothing! And I prayed like an idiot. As if God was gonna look after our boy after taking him! Will. I'll be two minutes. My poor baby. - I'm sorry Will. - Shhh... I'll make it up to you. Hello? Can you help me? When I went blind. You okay? He was right there. He took me to the hospital. He must have been right outside the house. Spying on me. Joel? Joel! It was his car you chased. He was right there, listening, he, he, he... he heard me close the pool cover and he knew Joel was in the pool. Drowning! He could have saved him... And he fucking did nothing! Do you think it'll be a boy? It was all very quick. I do want to make it up to you. What did you do with Will? Let's go inside. I know I made the wrong decision not saving Joel. I panicked. It was stupid. I could help you. Thank you. Is Elise alive? Of course. Paul, look at me. She just left you? Walked out. Like I said. But you planned all this. Planned that you'd go blind? No. No, that was pure luck. To Kill a Mockingbird... Do you remember reading that at Waterstones? Last summer. Late July. Well, one afternoon, soon after Elise left, I had nothing to come back up here for. And I wonder where you'd live. You followed me? It was only the 4th or 5th time, though... brought the microphone. Just... listening? I grew to like Will, too. He's got such a dry sense of humor. I know I could have saved Joel, but... I couldn't bare to give myself away. Don't worry Paul. One wrong decision. Can change my, change my life, change our lives forever. We'll be fine. Didn't think you'd understand. That should relax you. Hello.
