She's an alcoholic (man laughing) - How ya doing, Sarah? - [Sarah] Not so good, how 'bout you? - Oh okay. - [Woman] Oh, it's so wonderful to bring to him that way. - Yeah, it is. (woman laughing) Wouldn't you say so? - Sarah, how do you like your new school? - It's okay. - I'll bet you're making tons of new friends. - How 'bout you get us a couple of fresh ones, will ya, honey? - Hi, honey. - You're so cute. - How ya doing in school, huh? - He's cute. - You know, JoAnne, she looks like you. - Hey, how does it feel to be a grandmother, huh? - Fine, since Liz Taylor made it fashionable. - Yeah but Liz Taylor didn't let herself become a babysitter, right? - Right. - Well, that was her loss. Nancy can leave him with us anytime she wants to. - Oh (laughs)! - She has your smile (laughs). - It's he not her. That's he. - [Man] Hey, look at this little boy. - Wayne?

Did they ask you the same dumb questions they asked me? How do you like your new school? Nice girl like you must be dating lots of boys. I mean, how would they like it if I asked them if they were having any good love affairs lately? Well, I promise you, when you grow up I'll never ask you how you like your new school. Okay? - Sarah, Matt wants to introduce you to Mr. Peterson. - See what I mean? - Oh honey, come on, please try to make a good impression. You know how important this is to Matt. (baby babbles) - Sarah, Sarah, honey, I don't think you've met Mr. Peterson. You know, his son goes to the same high school as you. - Ray, Ray Peterson, have you met him? - I don't think so. - Well, you will, but you gotta watch out for him. I know he's my son but I still feel it's my duty to warn you. He, uh, well, you know, comes on a little strong with the girls, but he's a nice kid. I don't want to think anything of it. You know, he doesn't smoke dope, doesn't eat pills. (doorbell ringing) - Oh, I'll get that. - Oh Matt, you finished with that? - Thanks. - Well, how about it, Sarah? Shall I, shall I give Ray your phone number? - Well, actually, Mr. Peterson, I don't really like blind dates. I'm sure Ray doesn't either. - Mm, okay, can I at least buy you a drink? You can have a drink, because I made Matt a vice president. She could have a drink to help celebrate Matt becoming vice president, can't she? - Sure. She can have anything she wants, as long as it's ginger ale. - [Mr. Peterson] Well, mother knows best, so ginger ale, it's gonna be. Here we go, a little of that right there, and a little somethin' to help the medicine go down. (Mr. Peterson laughs) (Mr. Peterson grunts) Bob, where are you goin'? I want to ask you about that, I want to ask you about that airport contract. (gentle music) - You must hate nights like this. - Like what? - These parties, you know, serving all these people. - No, it's not so bad - Come on. - Okay. It's not my favorite way to spend an evening, but like the man says, that's what I'm paid for. - Okay. Go out and earn some money. - Thanks, baby. - Okay. (guests laughing) (guests chattering) (dramatic music) (Sarah sighs) - Sarah, is that all you're eating for breakfast? Oh, Matt, that must have been some terrific party. You know, I think we went through two cases of scotch. - Here, this'll help. (JoAnne sighs) And this. (JoAnne moans) - Sarah, isn't this the day you try out for the glee club? - Mm-hmm. - [JoAnne] Did you pick out what you're gonna sing? - Not yet. - (laughs) Did you see your boss? (laughs) Did you see old million-dollar Peterson trying to make it out to his silver-gray limousine. - [Matt] What about you Mrs. What's-Her-Name? - [JoAnne] What about her? - That lady holds her liquor like a broken glass. - (chuckles) Too bad she doesn't have your hollow leg. - [Matt] Complaining? - No, impressed. I've never seen a man drink so much and still be able to do 40 push-ups before bed (chuckles). (gentle music) - [Ken] (laughs) Come on, Marilyn, hurry up! - [Girl] Hey, come on, come on, get in here.

What is it? - I'm sorry, pal. I can't leave it with you. It's booze. - Oh. - Is your mom home? - Yeah, come on in. She's in the shower. (water pattering) Delivery from the liquor store, Mom! What do we do, huh? Okay. She said leave it on the dining room table. The money's in there. - Okay, that's $8.73 with the tax. (solemn music) (water pattering) (dramatic music) - Well, if he's not in his room, can you try the restaurant, please? I know it's a long distance call, but you can take it out of my allowance. - Oh honey, you know that's not necessary. You can call your father, anytime you want. But you can't expect him to come all the way back from San Francisco just because-- - He'll come. - Even if he does, then what? - Well, maybe he can arrange it, so I can go back to my old school. - Why would you want to go back to the old school anyway? You weren't so happy there. - Could you try the lobby then, please? It's important. - You were always complaining. Have you forgotten so soon? Honey, listen, maybe if you tried to talk to Matt. - I don't want to talk to Matt. I want to talk to my father. - Why do you treat Matt as if he doesn't exist? He tries to be nice to you. He's trying to make a life for us. - Daddy? It's me Sarah. Wait hold on a minute. Please. Daddy, how are you? - Hello, I'm home! - [JoAnne] Hi, hon. - Ugh, now what kind of a face is that to greet a vice president? Anything wrong? - No, not really. - [Sarah] Hi, Matt. - Oh, have you two been sniping at each other again? - Sarah, honey, I just hate to see you set yourself up for a disappointment, that's all. - I know, Mom, but you're wrong. He's coming, day after tomorrow, just to see me, just like I knew he would. My daddy's coming. I guess things aren't as bad as I thought they'd be. - Yeah, from the way you sounded on the telephone, I thought I was gonna find a little puddle of salty tears. - Oh, are you mad at me, Dad, I mean, you know, for dragging you all the way down here for nothing? - Where'd you ever get the idea you're nothing? Honey, you're one of the most important things in the world, I mean, you and your sister and of course my grandson. Aren't you supposed to be in classes, today? You're not cutting, are you? - What are you doin' away from work? You do still have a job, don't ya? - Ah, it's bright. Is this bright? - Dad? You do still have a job, don't ya? - Well, not exactly, no. No, not exactly. - Aw, Dad. - Come on, grab me a beer before you start sounding like your mother. - Out on the street? - There you go. I'll use this. Dump that, will you? (Richard laughs) So there I was walking across the San Gabriel River Bridge, and I stopped right in the middle of it, and I said, Richard, what the hell are you doing with your life? You're dragging your aspirations up and down a state. You're selling art supplies to other people for them to use. You see, that's what gets me, sweetheart. I got a lot of talent, I mean, a lot more than those kids coming out of art school. I mean, it wasn't my fault I had responsibilities, you know. I had to get a straight job. I don't want you to blame your mother. Now, I'm not doing that, now. So there I was, standing in the middle of the bridge, and I said it myself, Richard, what what would happen? What would be the earth-shaking consequences if you took the sample case and just threw it as far as you could? - You didn't. (laughs) You did? - Yeah. - (laughs) Daddy! - Well, that's one of the reasons I don't work there anymore. - What are you gonna do now? - Hmm, well, I'll tell ya what I'd like to do. - Go to Oregon? - (laughs) Perfect time for it. - Oh for both of us. I'd love it. - Get a little place out in the backwoods somewhere, lay in some canvas and some decent oils and maybe get a horse for you or something. - Oh Daddy, you could just paint all day. - Mm-hmm. - You wouldn't worry about delivery dates or sales quotas. - Sounds pretty good, huh? - Aw, Daddy, let's do it. Let's just pack up and leave. (Richard laughs) (solemn music) - Yeah. What about your mother? She seems to think I have a corrupting influence on you. You think, for a moment, she'd give up custody. (solemn music) Hmm? - I guess not. (solemn music) - We'll do it, honey. - When? - Soon, one day soon, really, I promise. (laughs) Hey, hey, listen. Hold it. In the meantime, I want you to go and get yourself one of the nicest outfits you can find. I want you to really look good at that party. - But Daddy, this is $50. You don't even have a job. - Ah, come on, don't worry about that. I already got something better lined up. Let's take a look in here. - I don't, Daddy! - Yeah, yeah! (Sarah laughs) Third largest art supply house in the state, I'm gonna be a district manager. How about this now? Hey, this is it, huh? Look at this! - Well, I don't know. It's not so cute. Why don't we look around? - Oh come on, now what are fathers for? How often do I get to see you anyhow? Here. - (laughs) $100! Oh Daddy, I love you! - I love you, too, baby. - [Nancy] Who you going out with tonight, Sarah? - Just a guy. - Not just a guy at all. He happens to be vice president of the junior class and captain of the swimming team. - [Nancy] Ooh. - How'd you know that? - Oh, his mother may have mentioned it to me. - Is that how you got fixed up with him, Sarah, through his mother? - No, he called and asked me. Wait, I didn't know you knew his mother. - Oh, I've met her a couple of times. - Well, you never told me that. - [JoAnne] Didn't I? - Mom, you didn't happen to mention to her anything about Ken taking me out or anything like that, did you? - Oh, no, why would I do a thing like that? I mean, I did mention that we have kids about the same age, and wouldn't it be nice if sometime they-- - Oh I knew it! I knew he wouldn't be interested in me. - Sarah, stop that. - Well, how could you do a thing like that to me. - I was only trying to help. We're new in the neighborhood, and you don't know many of the kids, and the situation just sort of came up. - You mean you made it come up. - Sarah, I have never tried to stop you from making your own friends. I did this for you. Can't you appreciate that? - No, and I'm not going. - [JoAnne] Sarah! - Look, I've had it. I'm just gonna lock myself in a room, and when he comes, you can just tell him-- - Tell him what? (Sarah groans) Sarah, I have gone to a lot of trouble to arrange this. If you embarrass me, so help me, I'll-- (doorbell rings) (Sarah groans) Now look, you stay there, young lady. - Sarah, listen now, honey. Mom went to a lot of trouble for this. - Yes. - Mrs. Hodges, is Sarah ready? - You must be Ken. - Yes, ma'am. - Well, come on in. Sarah will be ready in a minute. (Ken grunts) - [Nancy] You'll have a good time, anyway, so why don't you just go, okay? Come on. - Oh, hi. - Hi. (Ken coughs) - Well, we better get going. (JoAnne sighs) - [JoAnne] Have a good time, you two. - [Sarah] Good night, Mom. - That's a nice truck you have, Ken. - Oh, thanks. - You're welcome. - You got a nice mom. - I'm sorry for gettin' you dragged into this. - Forget it. - Listen, you can drop me in a movie if you'd like. - Hey, it's okay. Come on, we'll have fun, anyhow. (gentle music) (guests chattering) - How's the, uh, mercy date going? - Okay. - You, uh, want to dance with me? - You know I do. Just, just wouldn't be fair to her. - Oh yeah, right, never interfere with a, uh, social worker in the pursuance of his duty. - Ken, we got things to do. (gentle music) (man whistles) - Hey, Charlie, over here! - Hey, hey, dingbat! (guest chattering) - Weren't you at the glee club try-outs, the other day? - Yeah. - Shame you didn't make it. (gentle music) Are you looking for Ken? - No, no, I'm not. Excuse me. (guests chattering) (gentle music) - [Ken] Hey, Sarah, where ya goin'? Sarah? - I'm gonna go home. - Go home? What, how're you gonna get there? - Take a bus or something. - Hey, come on, look, we can have a good time, okay, come on. - All right. - [Ray] Hey, Ken, how ya doing? - Hey, Ray. Hey, fix her one, too, will ya? - Hey, look, Ken, if my dad catches on to this-- - Cool out, Ray, she's my date, okay? - Okay. - Well, maybe I shouldn't. - Oh come on, just one, it wont hurt you. That's all we're gonna have. - Okay, just one. (upbeat rock music) (guests cheering) - All right! (guests cheering) - Hey, Ed, have you seen Sarah? - No, she was right behind me when I left.

(Ken sighs) - Mr. Hodges! - [JoAnne] Get yourself in the house. - Sorry. - Whoops. - Off to bed with you, Miss. We'll talk about this in the morning. (Sarah laughs) (toothbrush scraping) - She okay? - I don't know why she's not throwing up. It worries me that that girl's so easily led. - So she had little to drink? At least she's not into drugs. - Thank God for that. - [Sarah] Good morning. Oh, did I miss breakfast? Oh, what time is it, anyway? Whew! - I didn't think you'd be hungry, this morning. - Oh, I'm starved. There's no bacon left, huh? Oh, about last night? Guess you're not too pleased about it, huh? - Should we be? 15 years old and you come home from a party roaring drunk. - I wasn't drunk. I had a few drinks, that's all. - Of all the places to pull a stunt like that, the Petersons! You have embarrassed us. You've made a fool of yourself at Matt's boss's house. - JoAnne! We agreed I'd handle it. Look, Sarah, I know I'm not your father. (JoAnne sighs) And I've never tried to take his place, have I? But I think I have to take some responsibility for handling discipline around here. Now it seems to me that any boy that gives liquor to a fifteen-year-old is not the kind of boy for you. - What makes you think it was all his fault? - Well, if it wasn't his fault, then whose fault was it? Did he give you the liquor, or didn't he? - Don't you think your mother's entitled to an answer? All right, then. I think the punishment in this case, if it's to have any meaning at all, should give you time to think about what you've done. So I'm gonna keep you in the house for two weeks. No going out, no seeing your friends after school, no movies on the weekend. If that seems unfair to you, I'd like you to say so. - Is the trial over? - [Matt] Yes. - Am I excused? - Yes. - Sarah! - He's not my father! He's just somebody you sleep with! (door slams) (slow rock music) - Sarah. (knuckles rapping) Oh! You almost got me. Come on out. - I can't. I'm grounded for two weeks. - You're kidding. That's kinda heavy, isn't it? Half the kids at that party went home loaded. - Well, my mom didn't think it was too cute. - I guess it wouldn't help if I talked to her, would it? - Let's just say, right now, she'd rather went out with the Zodiac Killer. (Ken groans) Well, that's too bad. Well, I was hoping we could go meet Daisy. - [Sarah] Daisy? - My horse. Are you sure you can't get out on parole? - Maybe if I called Matt. - [Ken] Matt? - He's my stepfather. - Oh, right, we've met. - And apologized to Matt and Mom and promised to never do it again. - Well, would that be so tough? - Do you really want me to? (hooves clopping) - Come on (clicks), come on, Daisy, come on. (Daisy whinnies) (Sarah grunts) She's old (chuckles), about 11. That's why I got her so cheap. Of course, the best part of it is she's got a lot of good stuff in her, and she loves me. - (laughs) I guess you love her, too. - Well, we're not engaged or anything. - Aw, come on, don't be embarrassed. I think it's great that you care about somethin' that much. - Let's go for a ride. - Oh wait a minute, I've never been on a horse before. I've never even patted one, well, except for a pony, when I was little. - Hey, come on, come on. Are you comin' up, or do I have to get a rope? - What do I do? - Put your foot in the stirrup. - All right. - Hand on the pummel. And I'll give you a good yank. Come on! There you go. (Sarah laughs) (Sarah squeals) Ready? - Oh go slow. Come on (clicks), come on then! Come on, Daisy, come on! (gentle music) Hey, Sarah. I gotta tell you the truth. When my mom first got on me to call you, I wasn't altogether pleased. You know what I mean? - [Sarah] Yeah. - [Ken] I don't know, at school, you seem so out of it. That's not what I mean. Hey. - [Sarah] That's okay. I guess I sort of was. (gentle music) - But that party, you came on singing and really super. You're different, Sarah, different from what I expected and a lot different from the girls around here. (gentle music) I guess I, I guess I just like that. (gentle music) (students chattering) - [Girl] Hey, here comes Sarah. - [Boy] Hey, Sarah, how's it going? - Hey, Sarah! - Hey, Sarah, how you doing? - That's a pretty coat. - You know, you really sang super, Saturday night. - You really tied one on. - Thanks. - Boy, I bet your parents really raised hell when you got home. - They sure did, but I talked them out of it. - Oh wow, how'd you do that? - Well, I reminded them of the times I've seen them like that. - What do you mean? - Drunk. - And it worked? - It sure did. - Wow. - Wow. - I'm really gonna have to try that sometime. - You do, 'cause it worked, man. - See you guys later. - See you later, Sarah. - Buh-bye. (engine revs) - Oh no. - Why're you stopping? - Look who's here, it's your mom's car. - Oh, okay, I'll get out then. (door squeaks) (engine revs) - You're so-- - I'm home! - [JoAnne] Well, then who took it? Just tell me that. If you didn't take it, who did? - [Margaret] I don't know, Mrs. Hodges. - You asked why I, you asked why I'm letting you go. Now that's why. Please, let's not make this any more painful than it has to be. - I never touched the liquor Mrs. Hodges. - Mom, see, it's all a mistake. - It's no mistake. My husband says the liquor's been watered. Now you can't fool a real scotch drinker about that, and there's been no one else around here to get into it. - Well then, what would it matter if we gave her another chance? - I'm sorry, Margaret. We won't be needing your services any longer. Now I have to meet Matt for dinner. There's some chicken in the refrigerator for you, honey. We'll be back later. - Bye, Sarah. - [JoAnne] Bye, honey! (door clacks) (solemn music) (water pattering) - [Sarah] How much is that? - I'll just wait till your mother comes out if you don't mind. - Oh, no, I don't mind. Of course, my mother's one of the longest shower-takers in Western civilization. We're trying to get her in the Guinness Book of World Records. - Well, that's one of the advantages of being the boss. I've got all the time in the world. - Look, mister, I'll tell you the truth. My mother's not here. - Yeah, I know. - Well, see, it was my father's birth... Uh, look, if you tell her, I'm gonna get in a lot of trouble. - Look, if I left this stuff here, I could get in a lot of trouble. I could lose my license. - I'm sorry. I guess I didn't think about that. - Yeah, what time do you expect your mother back? - Mister, please. Please, mister. (man sighs) - All right. I'll let you get away with this, just this once, but if you ever try anything like this again, so help me, I'll-- - I won't. I promise. - Yeah. Oh by the way, you better turn off the shower. (solemn music) (Sarah groans) (solemn music) (students chattering) - [Ken] What, you takin' to drinking cologne now? - You taking up spying on people? - Could I taste that? - You a cop or somethin'? - You sure turned on to that stuff pretty fast. - With this party Saturday night, are we gonna drive or take Daisy? - Hey, Sarah, look, you got me a little worried. Don't you think that drinking in school, I mean, right in the open, isn't that a little dumb? - Aren't you a little square? I mean, go out on the lunch court, half the thermoses smell of booze. So it's not such a major crime. - I don't care. I don't care about that. I only, I don't like seeing you do it, okay? - Remember, you're the one that got me started. - Am I? - Aw, Kenny, I'm sorry. You don't want me to do it anymore, so I won't, okay? - Hey, Sarah, better get over to the counselor's office. The guidance counselor wants to see you. - What for? - I don't know, but you better hurry up and get over there. Your mom's waiting for ya. - My mother? - Yeah, good luck. - Will you call me? - Sure. - Bye. - It's okay. - I think you know what the problem is, Sarah. You've been cutting classes. - I told Mrs. Farrell there's been a mistake and that you'd clear it up. - Um, well, last week, I, I had to go to the library, a few times, to finish a report on overpopulation. And then, well, I got my period, so I went to lie down in a friend's car for a while. - Why didn't you go to the nurse's office? - I guess I should've. Mom, it's all a mistake, and it only happened a few times. Tell her you said it was okay. - Mrs. Hodges, is this your signature on these absent excuses? - Mom, don't you remember when you told me to write those out for you? - No. - Uh, Sarah, it's almost time for your class. Why don't you go now? Your mother and I will try to sort this out, okay? Go on, go on. (JoAnne sighs) (solemn music) - You've made your point. Now it's up to me, isn't it? - She refuses to strip for gym. She seems distracted. She has mediocre grades. She just does enough to get by. Now Sarah is a girl with a high IQ and a lot of potential. Something's wrong. - It's a new school situation. - I saw her records from the last school. - I'll have my husband talk to her as soon as he gets home, tonight. - I don't quite think that's the answer. She has trouble fitting in with the other kids. Her moods are erratic. She seems depressed, sometimes. - Well, she's a teenager. It's one of the prerogatives of that age. I used to get depressed if I got a pimple on my chin. - Mrs. Hodges, last year we had a teenager who was depressed about a slight case of acne. He hanged himself. - Well, there must have been something else wrong with him. - Not necessarily. I mean, some kids just handle things better than others. His parents just thought it was a passing phase. Mrs. Hodges, perhaps, some professional counseling might help. - I don't think so. - Mrs. Hodges, the records show you were recently remarried, two years ago, and-- - That's right And do the records also show the kind of man I married. My husband is decent and hardworking. He cares for Sarah. He tries to be a positive influence on her. - Mrs. Hodges, I didn't mean to-- - Has anybody bothered to put into the records that I have managed somehow to raise another daughter who is happily married and has a new baby and never tried to hang herself. I don't know what it is about you people. You've got to believe that every kid from a divorced home is a candidate for nine years on a psychiatrist's couch. That's it, isn't it? Well, maybe if the school did its job, maybe if you made learning a little more interesting, got rid of some of the distractions, maybe if you did that, instead of passing out the dime-store psychology, every time you have a simple discipline problem-- - I am not trying to be a dime-store psychologist. (JoAnne sighs) - Well, even if you don't, my husband knows how to handle that sort of thing. - Oh he loves it! - (chuckles) He should. His aunt mad it for him in prison. - Oh, I'd say you got off easy. They're letting you go to the beach party, aren't they? - Mm-hmm. - Who you going with? - Oh just some of the kids. - No special boy? - Not really. - Hey, come on, what are big sisters for? - [Sarah] Well... - Well, is he cute? Is he tall? - He's just the most super guy in school, that's all. Can you believe somebody like that'd be interested in me? - Oh why shouldn't he be? - Got three days? I'll list all the reasons. - I'm just surprised Mom hasn't mentioned it to me. - Oh, well, um, mom hasn't met him yet. - Doesn't he come by the house to pick you up? - Well, he, he doesn't live nearby. He goes to a different school. - You said he goes to your school. - Oh, did I? - Sarah, you're not talking about that creep who got you drunk that night, Ken What's-His-Name? - He's not a creep. (baby cries) - Oh Sarah! - He's not like that at all, honest. It wasn't this fault, anyway. You're not gonna tell Mom, are you? What our big sisters for, you said. Promise you won't tell? Promise? - All right, Sarah, I promise. - I think I'd better go. - Sarah! But why can't you just tell mom about it? Why can't you be straight with her? She'll understand. - No, she won't. She never has. Seems all I ever do is manage to embarrass her. Sometimes I don't even think she likes me very much. - I swear you sound more like Daddy every day. - Yeah, well, now I'm beginning to understand what he had to live through. - What about her? What about what she had to live through? Believe me, Sarah, you just weren't old enough to know what was going on between them. - Yes, I was. She made him a, a salesman! (baby cries) - He was a dreamer! And she tried to make him into a husband. Is that so wrong? - Yes. Yes! (solemn music) (baby crying) - Sarah! (solemn music) Sarah! (solemn music) (Daisy neighs) - She's a little scared of lights. I'm gonna walk her across. (car horn honks) Whoa, whoa, whoa. (tires screech) Thank you. - Hey, you guys! (all yelling) Special treat, tonight, sports fans! Don't drop it, I only got one. Count of three, one-- - [All] Two! Three! (all cheering) - Let's go! - [Boy] Give it over here! (all chattering) Get the wine! - Get it open! (all cheering) - Hey, what are they doing? - Huh? - What are they doing? - Oh, that's Ray's famous watermelon trick. He plugs up the side of the thing and pours in about a quart and a half of gin. - No kidding? - No kidding. - Let's go! - [Ray] Hey, what's happening? - [Girl] Hey, how you doing? - [Boy] You guys are up. - [Boy] Let's do it! (guests cheering) - Hey, Sarah, slow down. Leave a little for the rest of us orphans. (laughs) Come on. Hey! - How ya doin'? - Hey, Sarah. Sarah, come here. I want to talk to you, come on. - Yeah, go on. - Come on, let's drink it! - [Ken] Aren't you going at it a little heavy? - [Sarah] Do you have to get on my back, too? I get enough at home from my mother. - [Ken] (sighs) Why do you have to lie? I never expected that from you, Sarah. - Lie? About what? - About drinking, about that I got you started, letting me take the blame that first night. - Oh, that. - Yeah, that. You don't drink like a beginner, Sarah. - Well, I'm glad you know. It's been a real hassle on me. But if my mother ever found out-- - Look, I don't care about taking the blame. - [Sarah] You don't? - I care about you. I care that you seem to need that stuff. - Oh come on, you make me sound like some major alcoholic freak. Look, I don't see purple cockroaches climbing the walls. Look, I take a drink every once in a while, 'cause it makes me feel good, makes all those hassles about my parents and the stuff in school go down just a little bit easier. - But why do you have to drink when you're with me? - I don't have to drink. I can quit anytime I feel like it. I just don't feel like it. - Okay. Well, let's go back to the fire. - Let's not. - Why not? - Because. (gentle music) (lips smack) I'll stop if you want me to. (gentle music) - We pay that service enough money. You think they'd keep it clean. - Oh they're all that way. You know that. - Hey, honey, as soon as I finish this, your mother and I going for a swim. You want to join us? - Oh no, I can't I'm gonna go babysitting. - Hey, what are you gonna do with all that money you're makin'? - I don't know. - Listen, there's a sale on TV sets at Gordon's. I'd be willing to match what you've got. Would you like a new color set for your room? - Really? - Uh-huh. - Super! - Okay, talk about it later. (car horn honks) - Oh, that must be for me. - Oh Sarah, I almost forgot. Your father called and asked me to tell you that he's sorry but he can't make it this weekend. Well look, honey, I thought that you and Matt and I could do something together. - He's probably got a good reason. Wait, it's probably that new job, that new job has been waiting for. He's gonna be a district manager (laughs)! Perfect, bye, Mom. Bye, Matt! (door clacks) Hi, Mr. Tyler. - Hi, honey. - Sorry, I'm late. Do you think I can have a friend over to study tonight? - Oh, I don't see why not. - Thanks. (crickets chirping) The other night at the beach party... - Yeah? - Well, well, it was kinda special to me. - It was for me too. - No, I mean like, well, like I've never, well, you know what I mean. - Well, me neither. - (laughs) That's what I thought. - Hey (laughs). - Why aren't we going together? - We're just not. - Then why don't we? - I thought the guy was supposed to ask the girl that. - I haven't had a drink since the party. - Good. - Is that all you could say, good? - You said you weren't a booze freak. I believe you. - Then why didn't you call me till last night? - Sarah, look, come on, if I don't get at least B in chemistry, I can kiss veterinary college goodbye, so let's just do our homework, okay? - I love you. Do you love me? Do you? - That's a little strong, isn't it? We've only known each other a few weeks. - Not if you feel it. - I like things the way they are. It's been good so far. Why do you wanna push? Okay. (Ken sighs) I like you, Sarah. I maybe even like you more than any other girl, but that doesn't mean that we-- - What other girl? - [Ken] Well, you know. - No, I don't know. Have you been seeing other girls? - Well, some. - Why? I haven't been seein' other guys! - We never had that kind of understanding, Sarah. - Who, Marilyn? Have you been seeing Marilyn? - (sighs) Hey, I don't need this. - Oh, I should've known you were just using me. (baby cries) Oh, now look what you've done. - Hey, look, I think I'd better go, okay? - I think that's a great idea. Come on, baby. Go back to your stupid Marilyn and tell her what a fool I've been. (baby crying) Come on. (baby crying) Kenny, come back! (car door thuds) I didn't mean it! (baby cries) (engine revs) Now what am I gonna do? (baby cries) All right, I'll get your bottle. (solemn music) (Sarah sighs) No, he's got to be there, just let it ring. No, just a little longer, please. No, he's gotta be there, just let it ring. Just let it ring! Oh Daddy! Oh Eric. (sobs) Thirsty, huh? - [Fred] What, you forget the house keys? - [Mrs. Tyler] No, I have the car keys. - [Fred] I thought you took the house keys when you took the car keys. - Oh honey! - It's okay. Sarah will let us in. (knuckles rap) (Eric cries) - Sarah! Sarah! - Sarah! - Sarah, what is it? - Sarah! - What's the matter? - Hey, Sarah! - [Eric] (cries) Mommy! (glass clatters) - It's all right, honey. It's all right, honey. Yeah, shh, shh, shh. - What is it? (Eric crying) - Sarah? - Okay, okay, shh. What is it? (Eric crying) Oh, baby, don't cry. Shh, shh, shh. - Sarah, wake up! - What is it? - Mr. Tyler-- - Sarah, get up now! - Sarah, what got into you? How could you have been so irresponsible? You're just lucky Fred Tyler didn't call the police. Do you know that? This is going to be all over the neighborhood. It's gonna be all over Matt's office. Just what was in your mind when you decided to pull such a stupid stunt? Answer me. Don't you have anything to say? - Oh I think I'm gonna be sick. - Good. I hope you get so hung over you'll be in bed for a week. Then maybe that'll give you something to think about next time. You sit there. Did he get drunk, too? - Who? - You know who, that Ken character and don't bother telling me you haven't been seeing him, because I know otherwise. - Did Nancy tell you that? She promised. - Never mind who told me. It was for your own good. - I told you last week what had to be done, JoAnne. Now do you agree with me? - What? What has to be done? Who you calling? - His parents. - Matt's going to tell them to keep that son of theirs away from my daughter, that he's got her drinking and God knows what else. - Don't. You can't. Ken has nothing to do with my drinking. - Sarah, don't try to protect him. It won't work. - Do you remember after the Christmas party when I was real sick and the doctor said over stomach flu? And when you fired Margaret for getting into the liquor? Who do you think really drank it? Mom, listen to me. I've been drinking for nearly two years now, almost every day. I've snuck booze from the house. And I've stolen it from liquor stores. I've even taken money from your purse. Who knows? Probably would've drunk rubbing alcohol if I couldn't get my hands on anything else. - You're lying. Why? (Sarah sighs) - I don't know. - You don't have much faith in shrinks, do you, Mrs. Hodges? - Well, I-- - No, no, that's all right. That's all right. Some days, I have doubts of my own. Now would you tell me again please. Why did you come? - The guidance counselor at Sarah's school thought that there might be something wrong with Sarah. And well, I'm ready to admit that now, some sort of behavior problem. - Hmm. Sarah tells you she's been drinking almost every day for nearly two years, and you call it a behavior problem? - Well, she wasn't picked up out of some Skid Row bar, you know. I mean, she's only 15. You want to tell me she's an alcoholic or something? - That's not my judgment to make. - Well, then who's gonna decide? Sara? - That's right. Seems to me, a fifteen-year-old who drinks every day has a lot to say that nobody is listening to. - Believe me, Doctor, I've listened. - Have you heard? Kids develop alcohol problems like anybody else, because they're troubled or lonely or frightened. Booze helps them to live, to face social situations, to get through the day, and it works, for a while, and then it stops working, because alcohol is a mean and sneaky drug. First, it giveth. Then it taketh away. And one day, you know, it's gonna kill you. - What can we do? - We can get Sarah's father down here. The four of us can go to work on this thing together. - I wouldn't count on getting him here. - Well, try, it's important. There's something important that Sarah has to do, on her own. - She'll do it. - Now, Sarah, if we're gonna accomplish anything, Sarah, you have got to get off the booze. It sets up a wall between us. - She's not going to be doing any more drinking. I'll see to that. - Not you, Mrs. Hodges. Sarah. - What about you? Aren't you going to help? - Of course, I will, but the first step has got to be Sarah's alone. Now I'm sure both of you have heard about Alcoholics Anonymous. - Oh no, I'm sorry. That's where I draw the line. - Then you know about AA. - Sure, bunch of boozers somebody scraped up, out of the gutter. She goes there she'll learn more about drinking than she ever knew before. - (laughs) I wouldn't worry about that, Mrs. Hodges. We're a country of whiskey-heads. Sarah gets permission to drink every time she sees you and your husband hoist that old five o'clock pick-me-up. - You're not going to lay that on me, Dr. Kittredge. I'm not even sure I did the right thing in coming here. I mean, I bring you a child with emotional problems, and you try to make her out to be some kind of wino. - And before you'll admit that she might have a drinking problem, you'd sooner see her as crazy, right, some kind of a head case? Mrs. Hodges, it's not anything to be ashamed of. - Sarah, I think we better go. - I think it's time Sarah started thinking for herself. Sarah, I'd like to talk to you alone for a few minutes. How do you feel about that? - I'll stay. - I'll wait outside. - Well? - Well what? (Marvin chuckles) - Do you think you're an alcoholic? - No, no, I'm not. - Hmm, all right. - Do you believe me? - (laughs) Well, it doesn't matter what I believe in. Something you have to know about yourself. - Oh, then I guess I won't be coming back here anymore. - Suit yourself. - If I was a, well, I'm not, but if I was, how could I tell? - Well, you cross the kind of imaginary line. You begin doing things that are destructive to yourself and the people around you. When you recognize that, then you know. - Well, I don't do any of those things, and I can quit drinking whenever I like. - Do you ever get the shakes, Sarah, cold sweats? Do you ever feel like you can't get out of bed and face the day without getting a little booze, you know, just an eye-opener? Did you have a drink today before you came here? Sarah, would you like to show me that you can stop drinking for good, never take another swallow? - The creep gave me that piece of paper, wants me to go to some cruddy old AA meeting. - (sighs) If you want to know the truth, Sarah, I don't think it's such a bad idea. - Aw, gee, I'm just surrounded by traitors. - Sarah, if you're not an alcoholic, what are you afraid of going to a meeting for? - Why should I, just to please him, hmm? - How about to please me? (people chattering) - Hey, here's a new face. Hi, I'm Bobby. - Hi. Am I in the right place? - If you're looking for the AA meeting, you are. - I thought maybe it was a school dance or somethin'. - Close. You got a name? - Sarah. - Come on, Sarah, I'll put you in touch with a doughnut. (Sarah chuckles) Hey, don't hog the punch. Here's your doughnut. - Oh (chuckles), thank you. - Uh, Carol. Carol, this is Sarah. - Hi. - Hi. - Uh, see that she gets properly nourished. I got to get my head together for this ordeal. - Okay. - Pretty smart little kid, isn't he? - Mm, he sure is. He'll be starting high school next year. - You're kidding. - Mm-mm. Uh, you don't want that douhgnut? - Mm, no (laughs). - Okay, then how about some coffee or punch? - Punch, please. - Okay. Your first meeting? - Mm-hmm, and my last. - Yeah, I remember the first day I came through those doors. I said to myself, this place is a leper colony, and I'm no leper. - Want some? - Mm, no, thanks. What I am is an alcoholic. - What I'm not is an alcoholic. - Then congratulations, Sarah. That makes you one of the lucky ones. - Look, if I was, I'd say so, huh. - Sure, nothing hard about admitting your hooked, except then you gotta give up the booze. And Lord knows no dedicated, hardworking alcoholic wants to do that. - I wouldn't know about that, right? - The trouble is I didn't admit it soon enough. See, I was drunk, one night, and I was driving my brother's car, and oh hell, you didn't come here to listen to drunk stories. (hands clapping) - Okay, everybody, let's settle down, grab a chair, relax. - Bobby. - You're not really like them, a little kid like you? - We have a birthday tonight. We're celebrating one year of a new life and sobriety. Bobby R. (group applauds) - Yay! (group applauds) ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Bobby ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Keep coming back ♪ - Yay! (all applaud) - Hi, my name is Bobby R. - [All] Hi, Bobby R. - And I'm an alcoholic. I want to thank everybody for the cake. I couldn't have gotten it without you, your help and your patience and your understanding. I want to thank you for the hardest year of my life and the best. I want to thank you for my life. I may be only 11, but my liver thinks it's 60. (group laughs) See, I started drinking, ooh, about the time I started to walk. My brothers would bet me to sipping pop wine, just for the fun of seeing the little kid get sloshed. By the time I was 9, I'm bringing milk laced with scotch to school in my thermos. But I wasn't the only kid doing that, either. Some days half the class would be smashed, and the school would never know it. They were too busy sniffing around the bathrooms for pot smoke. I found the hardest part of being a drunk was the lying, lying to everybody, my folks, your friends, even lying to yourself. You'd figured they wouldn't have cared, my folks. After all, they thought it was kind of funny, little kid begging sips of beer and when I snitched Uncle Mike's cocktail glass and hid in the closet with it. But when I came to them and said, Mom, Dad, guess what, I'm an alcoholic, they didn't think that was so amusing, for they'd rather I'd had been anything else, a cat burglar, a communist. It was hard for me to admit it to myself. But it wasn't their problem anymore. It was mine. And I had to kick and crawl and puke my way to the place where I can finally admit it and lose enough friends and do badly enough in school and get so damn disgusted with myself and hate myself, where I can finally look in the mirror and say, face it, man, you're an alcoholic, and if you don't get some help, you're gonna die. (solemn music) - Sarah! Hope we see you again. (solemn music) - [Richard] Horseback with a bunch of people. - Oh come on, Richard! - [Richard] I never get to see her. - [JoAnne] You slip 100 bucks into her purse, and then you're off to San Francisco, but you leave the problems behind, with me. - Yeah, I have seen what a terrific job you've been doing with her. - [JoAnne] Oh, I suppose you could've done better. - Yeah, I think I could. I'm not forgetting how you turned Nancy against me. - Nancy did not need any help from me. She was old enough to remember how it was when you were around. - Yeah, and what about Sarah? I give my baby to you and what's-his-name, and you make her so damned unhappy she starts boozing before she's old enough to give up paper dolls. - [JoAnne] Oh no, you don't. You're not gonna blame me for that, Richard. I'm not the one who filled her head with all those beer bottle dreams about painting in the Oregon woods. - [Richard] What the hell would you know about dreams? The only dream you ever had was locking some poor slob into a nine-hour slot, so you could sit around until noon, in your housecoat. - How would you know how long I ever sat around? You were never there long enough to find out. - All right, all right, come on now, let's take it easy, okay. Hey, Sarah, you got anything to say about all this? You've got a voice, you know, an equal voice. That's what family therapy is all about. Okay, let's try it this way. What would you say to your folks if you could get them to listen to you, for once, really listen? Mom, what I wish is... Come on. - Mom, I wish that you and dad wouldn't fight so much, and that you still loved each other, most, that we were still all together. - Honey, you know that's impossible. - Well, then, I wish you'd love me for what I am, not expect me to be Nancy or somebody I'm not. - [Marvin] Dad? - [Sarah] Daddy, Daddy, I love you, and I want to come live with you now. - Oh Sarah, you know your mother'd never go for that. - Yes, I will. - You will what? - I'll let her go with you, Richard. Obviously, I haven't done a very good job with Sarah. I thought I did. I tried. - Don't tell me. Tell her. - Sarah, I do love you, the best way I know how, but maybe some kind of a change would be better for you. So I give you my permission to go live with your father. - Mr. Travis. - Oh sweetheart, uh, you know how much I want you to be with me. I mean, you know that. But, ah, yeah, I'm on the road almost all the time. I live out of a suitcase. Now what kind of life would that be for you, hmm? And don't you really think it'd be better for, for a girl to live with her mother. I mean, that seems much more natural. And I can hardly take care of myself, much less the 15-year-old girl. You can certainly understand that, can't you, hmm? Can't you? Well, what's everybody looking at? It wasn't my idea to come here, you know. You want somebody to hang the blame on. I can understand that. Well, it's not gonna be me. You're not gonna embarrass me in front of my little girl. No way. You're gonna have to find somebody else to hang it on. (door slams) (somber music) - Okay, just hold it. What do you think you're gonna do with? - Nothing. - Oh, nothing? - I was gonna buy it from you. - You were gonna pay for this, right, with money? And you think I'm gonna sell it to you, your age, right? Listen, I want to tell ya. I want ya out of here, and I don't want ya coming back or I'm gonna call the police. - Yeah, I understand. - [Clerk] Do you understand that? Out! (engine rumbles) - Ooh, I'll get. - All right. - Hand him your coins. - There's a brown. - So we got, uh, two six-packs, of bottle of Tingles, some Cameron Castle and three potato chips. - Right. - Baked potatoes? - Okay, that'll be a 10% charge for the ID, also. - Get out of here. - No way! - Hey, do you think you could buy me a fifth of vodka? I've got the money here. - Uh, no, I, I don't think so. - I'll do anything you want, please. - How's that again, baby? - I'll do anything that you want. (guys laughing) - [Blonde Guy] Say, how 'bout a slug of that? - Can't hold it, huh? - Hey, come on, I paid, too. Let me have some. - Right, you did. Here you go, Sarah. - Oh! - Don't spill that stuff, man. - Come on. - What, over here, over here. - Come on! (guys laughing) Hey, come on, you guys, this is not funny! - Hey, Sarah, woo! - Whoa, don't spill it! - Come on! - One more time! (guys laughing) - Come on, please! - The baby wants her bottle. - Hey, just stop! - Let her have it, huh? - Come on, come on, come on. - Come on! (sobs) I want it. - She's crying. - You promised! You promised! - That's right. You made some promises too, you know. (laughs) All right, friends, step right up. The name of the game's Spin the Bottle. Winner gets the first go around (laughs). (bottle clattering) - Hey! - Hey! - There, there. - That's our man. - No, man, I don't think so, come on. It's just the game, let her have her bottle, let's go. - What's the matter? You're gonna hurt the little lady's feelings. - Hey, come on, Rog, he's right. Just lay off her. - Yeah, come on, man, we don't need this stuff, huh. - (laughs) Well, I guess I win the kewpie doll. What do you know (laughs)? (engine rumbling) Oh Sarah, you forgot your bottle. (engine revs) (solemn music) (Sarah cries) (dramatic music) (Sarah coughing) (dramatic music) (Sarah groaning) (intense music) - I got your message at the airport. Now where's she gone, huh? - I don't know. She's just gone. - How long, how long has she been gone? - All day! Matt's talking to the police again now. - JoAnne. They don't have anything to report yet. Come on in, Richard. - Okay, thank you. (Daisy nickers) - [Ken] Come on. (crickets chirping) Now hang in there, Daisy. I'm gonna tell Mom I'm gonna feed you before we eat. (Daisy nickers) Hey, Mom, Mom! (solemn music) (Sarah grunting) (solemn music) (Daisy whinnies) (Sarah grunting) (gentle music) - Oh why? Why doesn't nobody like me, Daisy (sobs)? (somber music) (Sarah sobbing) (Sarah grunts) (bottle clatters) (Daisy whinnies) (dramatic music) Come on, Daisy! Come on! (dramatic music) (Sarah grunting) - Sarah? Sarah! Sarah! (dramatic music) (Sarah grunting) Sarah! (dramatic music) (Sarah grunting) - [Sarah] Come on, Daisy! (car horn honks) (Sarah yells) (tires screeching) (horns honking) - Treat a kid like a neurotic, she starts acting like one. - She ran away because you rejected her. - I rejected her? You're the one who rejected her. You're the one who said you didn't care whether she stayed or left. - You have about as much sensitivity as a-- - As a what? - Take it easy, JoAnne, here. Come on, Richard. We're all rational adults here. Sarah will be all right. Here, have some of this. It'll help. - Thanks, I'll pass. (police radio chattering) (Ken sobbing) (Daisy grunts) - No chance, buddy. - Hey, come on, just a chance. That's all I want, just a chance. - Son, come with me. (Ken sobs) Look, I'm gonna have to-- - Hey. You gotta do something, please. - Look, don't want the horse to suffer, do ya? (gun fires) (Sarah sobs) - Kenny. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Ken. I killed Daisy. Ken, look at me. I'm sorry I'm alive. (Sarah cries) - Hey, hey, you, come back here! - I'll get her. Clean this traffic up. (Sarah crying) (police radio chatters) (Sarah gagging) (Sarah coughs) - Please, please (cries). (Sarah pants) Now, now, are you gonna lock me up? - [Marvin] What for, Sarah? Come on, come on, you're not crazy. - What am I then? Everything I do is wrong. I'm just not, just not a normal person. I hurt the people I love. I destroy everything I touch. (metal clatters) - [Marvin] You've crossed that imaginary line, remember? You're just beginning to recognize it. - [Sarah] I killed Ken's horse. - [Marvin] That's right, you did. - [Sarah] He may never forgive me for it. - [Marvin] He may not. - I picked up a guy for a bottle of booze. - Well, that's something you're gonna have to forgive yourself for. - I feel so sick. (Sarah sighs) Why, why was I even put in the world if I have to feel so rotten all the time. Do something! Help me! - I can't. - What kind of doctor are you? - Look, you have a choice, Sarah. You can sink into the bottom of a bottle and drown, or you can climb out. Now I can't make that choice for you. I can't badger you or frighten you or coax you into it. No amount of therapy or love or gin and tonic is gonna make you do it. You have to do it alone. - But I can't do it alone. - All you have to do is it take the first step. After that, there'll be people to help you. I'll help you. Come on, come on. - You won't! (Marvin coughs) - You know the word, Sarah. I can't say them for you. I can't believe them for you. - You're no doctor! You're just mean, and you're ugly, and you like to watch people suffer. Now just get out here. - All right. There's some people outside waiting for you. - Get out! (solemn music) - I know. It must have been awful for you, honey. But things are going to be different from now on you, you'll see. And the first thing we have to do is just all forget this ever happened. Come on. (solemn music) - Hello, honey. I, I don't know what came over me in that therapy session.
