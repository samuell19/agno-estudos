You spent way too much time in the vault. We gotta fucking move. Let's just go. Put the gun down! We don't have time. - Fuck it! - Fuck! We have a cop down at Cruces and Church. Send a bus! One suspect still in the area, on foot, heavily armed. Knight, where the fuck you going? We need to wait for backup. Help me please. Get a bus out here now. Bunch of kamikaze, burn-out, born-to-lose motherfuckers. Thanks for your expertise. This is Two-Grant-042 pulling up now to East 13th... Shots fired. Shots fired. We need backup.

Think about it, man. - No! - Drop it! No. Fuck off! Drop the gun. Drop it, old man. Put the gun down, you old fuck. Fuck. Internal Affairs will conduct the review. You know the drill. Thank you. What and where? This one's dead, the other one's inside. Hey. Hello, sir. Sir, can you hear me? Is he alive? I don't hear anything. Must be the wind. Lead the way. It's the guy all shot up inside. You can't miss him. Officer, I can take it from here. Thank you. -Sir, can you hear me? -Uh-huh. Yeah? All right. All right. Fuck! - Prep the bus. - He's not gonna make it. Come on. Come on! Motherfucker! Oh, fuck! What? What the fuck are you doing? Help. Fuck, Dezi! Oh, my God! Come on. Are you two fucking old enough to be EMTs? The pulse is, uh, 50 bpm. - The renal artery was nicked. - Prep for surgery. - Two bags O neg. - Sir, eyes open. Look at me. Can you tell me your name? Tell me your name. Sir? Sir? Okay. Make a hole, make a hole. We're coming through. Get the trauma surgeon in. Where is Bradley? Get me... You okay?

How did you find it? -Oh, where is she? -You're the detective. You tell me. You're right. Once upon a time-- Once upon a time, I had a husband who didn't give a shit about my feelings or my time. I just want to talk to my daughter. She's an adult. She doesn't have to talk to you if she doesn't want to. I'm better than ever. Hell-- She doesn't want to talk to you. Her last text was two words: "Bite me." I'm trying to apologize. What's that? What's it look like? She isn't a child. She'll always be my kid. Just-- You leave the bear. I'll make sure she gets it. So, you were telling me about Turks and Caicos. Hey, don't worry about him. If there's one thing that he's good at, it's leaving. Thanks, everyone. "Out of the night that covers me, black is the pit from pole to pole. I thank whatever God may be for my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance, I have not winced or cried aloud.

Good cops never die, they just get promoted to the precinct in the sky. Rest in power. To Officer Flanagan and Officer Cortez. Hear, hear. Next round is on me. Thank you. Whoo! Uh, two Budweisers. I need a drink. Waiter. Here you go, kid. Six bucks even. Hey, asshole. The man just saved a life. He's earned a free one. I hate this place. It has its charms. Fifteen bucks. You said six. Well, with the tequila it's 15. What tequila? I don't see any tequila. Whatever. Don't roofie my drink. Captain wants me pulling swing all week. -Tell the union. -Hmm. I should. You know-- You know, too many stupid people around here at this time doing stupid things. Hey, give me the Fourth over Halloween and Christmas any day. A couple of kids shooting some fireworks? No biggie for me. You know, those fireworks set off every single alarm in Teslas and every single building from here to Anaheim. It actually makes me miss New York. And you're gonna have to deal with so many bullshit phone calls. Yo, Justin Bieber! You eavesdropping right now? Yeah, um, I'm busted. My name is Dezi. I-- We don't give a fuck. This is a cop bar. What kind of badge is it? EMT? You think that means something? Yeah, so, uh, I just have to save your sorry asses, but I can't have a beer with you? Too thick to make it as a doctor. Look, I've got a lot of respect for my, uh, blue-blooded brothers, right? My mother was a guard. So, your mother was a guard? And you're bragging about that? Guards. They're like the Irish us. Oh, yeah. Are you Irish, huh? Uh-- I hear that, uh, Irish girls are very easy. How is your mother? You must have shit for brains to step in front of me like this. Okay. You're gonna have to go. -Well, I thought this was the land of the free. -It ain't for you. Yeah. All right. I think I'll finish my beer. Thank you. You have to go. Oh, great.

No, no, no, no. Dez... Dez. This is the worst idea. You think too much. Why the hell did you start a fight in a cop bar? They're never gonna let us back in there. Mmm. I want an answer. Maybe 'cause I almost was one. One of what? I always wanted to be a cop. Bullshit. No lie. Nearly broke my dad's heart. Not exactly a law-abiding citizen. And what happened? Well... I, uh, didn't exactly make it through the department interview. Mmm. Yeah, they said my moral compass was skewed or whatever. You? Yeah, I was this close, but... Yeah, I still wanted to do some good, you know? EMT life, baby. Probably doing more good than those assholes, anyway. There are some good cops. Like, most are good. Oh yeah? Well, you'll have to introduce me to one. Maybe. I, uh, think I started that fight. Well, first of all, I didn't start the fight. Mmm. Okay. I was defending myself, which is a big difference. Sure. I don't know. I guess I just wanted to see how tough the LAPD really was, you know? You're crazy. Oh, and you're adorable. Don't call me that. Ever. Yes, ma'am. This was a one-time thing. Oh, okay. It's a one-time thing and then it's a-- until it's a two-time thing. And then it's a three-time thing, okay? And then it's a four-time thing. You think you're so charming. Get the Narcan. Stay with us. Did Kyle shove you? What did I say? If someone shoves you, you punch 'em. If they pull a knife, you pull a gun. If they bring a tank, call me. All right? Kyle. Get over here. Get up. You've been pushing him around again? Milton, you know what to do. Go on. Shake hands. All good? Go on. What did I say to you about slouching? Easy on the spread, it has to last a month. Mmm. You know, your mother would turn in her grave if she saw the world now. This isn't the country it once was. Small miracles, that's all we can hope for. You know, every gang in Long Beach is trying to get their hands on those kids. We feed them, get tutors for them. This shelter, it's a legacy. As long as it stays open, her memory will last. Mom would be proud of you, Dad. Yeah, well, pride isn't a luxury I-- I can afford, you know? Takes all my strength to keep the lights on here. We've been defunded. Yeah. Budget cuts, that's what they say, because of the riots last year. The state doesn't get it, you know? Save a kid, you save the future. Anyway, I got to get to business. Um, do you want me to tell the kids -the youth center's closed? -No. I invited them. They're gonna help with creative ways to keep the lights on. Come on, buddy. Everything in your life has been leading up to this moment. It's the opinion of the department that why someone enters law enforcement is as important as the work they do on a daily basis. Why do I wanna be a cop? I like doughnuts. Gun fights. -Car chases. -Okay, okay. This isn't your first time in here. That's right. But this is a safe space. You were given a second chance after New York, and we need to make sure you don't slip into your old cowboy ways. I can't tell your captain that you're safe to go back on the streets unless I know you're not a danger to yourself or others, that's bottom line. Look, I gave my statement. It was a good shooting. I feel better. Tell me the truth. Why do you wanna be a cop? I want my daughter to be safe. To be proud of me. Now your father, he was a bank manager in Newark. Can you just tell me a little bit about him? He was shot during an attempted robbery, is that right? We're done. Dezi? Dezi? Report to the supervisor office. Boss? Dezi, take a seat. I got a witness from the Beston Bank robbery that says you refused to offer medical assistance. Triage. This isn't a war zone. Would you rather me save the villain or the victim? I read your report. Yes. We arrived on the scene, right? We went past the dead cop. I made a judgment call, and then we went into the manager's office. You broke protocol carrying him out like that. I saved the guy's life. He's suing the city and you for emotional trauma sustained during emergency transportation. Get the fuck out of here. -You're suspended. -What? Dezi. I did nothing wrong. Take a few weeks. Let legal come to a resolution, it'll blow over. That's not fucking fair! You think you can talk to me like this? Fuck it. You're fired for insubordination and refusing to offer medical assistance to someone in need. You can't fire me. Your contract is terminated now. You can't fire me, because I'm the best fucking para you fucking got. You fire me, and you hurt the whole fucking city. Big fucking whoop. Get out of my office. Right now, we live in a society where there's one rule for us, and another rule for them. That's not just here. That's all over the world. That's spreading right now. That's the pandemic. We are not judged, people. The rich, the famous, all of them, they have their agenda. They decide what's right and what's wrong. But we know what's right. We know what's right. You see Portland? The world is gonna look exactly like Portland if we don't have heroes. The world needs heroes. Fact: Cops have the hardest job in the world. Fact: This city is tearing itself apart, and cops are our last line of defense. We need cops who don't care about red tape. Who don't care about the politics and who's gonna become mayor or a four-year term limit. Defund the police? Right, yeah, sure, great idea. Defund the police, and then see who comes to the rescue when cartels are running free. When you can't even get a cup of coffee without getting mugged. Who cares about how people go to jail? You will never see all the good things that the cops do. You will never see them breaking up domestic violence incidents, organizing, uh, food drives, because that's not good content. Defund it, yeah. Cool, I'll wait. Hey Boots, come here. What have you got going on the morning of the Fourth? I'm headed to the beach with my girl, sir. I've been looking forward to it all week. We're looking for volunteers for the At-Risk Shelter. Setting up, you know food, cleaning, you know. Yeah. I can't force you to say yes. But I can tell the sergeant that you declined. I would love to, but we've been planning this for a month. I got to pick her mom up at the airport. Fine. Give it to me. Serve and protect. Well, this is me serving. I'm gonna need you to protect me from my girlfriend. Thank you. You think I'm kidding. But I ask this, "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?" Who watches the watchers? Answer: Too many people. Police can't effectively uh, do their job with this level of scrutiny from the media and, uh, the public. I say cops don't do enough. They need a ghost, someone that can take out the trash and doesn't have to worry about the red tape. I'm not talking about, uh, a vigilante. I'm talking more of a... Angel of Justice. ...vigilante. I'm talking more of a... Angel of Justice. Angel of Justice. Angel of Justice. Justice. Justice. Justice. Justice. Justice. Justice. Angel of Justice. Knight! My office, now. Hey, boss. Shut up. Yes, ma'am. What are you working? Paperwork. No thanks to you. Good. Here's some more. Someone stole a uniform, badge, gun-- the whole shebang-- from the coroner's office down at North Roads Hospital. Family wants the badge back. IA wants the gun and I want to know what kind of degenerate would do such a thing. -No security cameras? -Nope, no. Privacy reasons. Privacy? The customers are dead. That means you're gonna have to do a little leg work. And by the looks of things, you could do with getting in some more steps. Ouch. Just calling it like I see it. You sleeping all right? Ah, thank you for noticing. It was a late night. Narcotics Unit intercepted a couple of tons of coke and some women. -Cartel shit? -Oh, they wish. No, it was the Vampos Gang. I guess all the names were-- were taken. Oh hey, congrats on the divorce. I'm a free man. Yeah, well, uh, your ring finger may be free, but your ass still belongs to the department. Mmm. Don't I know it. How's your daughter? She's fine. Uh... Fine is not the F word I would use to describe your daughter. But then again hey, I mean she's got a dad like you and a mom like Camilla. A shrink could diagnose those daddy issues three states away. Did somebody piss in your coffee? I'm just saying that there's a way to balance out work and home life. How many husbands have you had? I didn't say I knew how to balance it out. I'm just saying there is a way. You know, I mean look at Fitz. Fitz is a good boy. He's whipped. That is true. He's a good cop though. What makes you say that? There's none finer. No, I'm-- I'm curious now. What do you think makes a good cop? A good cop doesn't sleep well, so everyone else can. I'll accept that. Oh, ah, one last thing. You and Fitz are working the Fourth. I'm going camping. Camping? Yeah. I got a cabin. Uh, that's not camping. Not unless I get time off. The Fourth? That's my favorite day. And I expect you to protect and serve with a smile on your face. Thank you, Knight. Pensions are our specialty. Your future is safe. I bank here. Set up an account so we can get you some nice compound interest or maybe an investment account would be better for you. How much do you-- Investment account? Okay, that's fine. Officer. What can I do for you? I, uh... Are you here to do a 6-8-9? Yes. Yeah. Miss Gakowski. The officer... ...wants to do a 6-8-9. Are you okay, Officer? Your uniform looks kind of wonky. Call the union. The department should not be sending you out like that. Do I know you? Were you here that night those tweaker assholes made a run at my vault? Yeah. I mean, I-- I heard about that. My ass was almost cooked, but you boys saved my life. I'm sure those paramedics did a good job, too. It was the blue bloods and the doctors at Saint Mary's. They're the heroes. Are you part of the 14th? I have a guy whose father used to be the night commander. James Jayne? Oh, yeah, sure. You know him? Yeah. Good man. I thought he died. Well, you know... cops never die. Amen, brother. Blue lives never die. Thank you for what you do. So, do you have any plans for the Fourth? Ah, you know, uh, the usual. Ah, yeah, work never ceases. I can relate. I will be here toiling away. But I love it. There's nothing more American than making money on the Fourth. Jesus Christ. Come on. Sir. Have at it. Yeah. We've been defunded. Takes all my strength to keep the lights on here. Go, go, go. Everybody down! Down on the ground! - Get down! - Oh, my God! -You, back to the register right now! -William, hang-- hang on. Let's go, let's go! Let's go! Empty the register! Fucking vault's open. I'm going for it. Stay down! Let's go. Stay on the ground. You, against the wall! Get your head down! Let's go. Stay on the fucking ground! - Shit! Ah! Fuck! - You all right? I said no vault! Look at all this fucking cash! I'm fucking shot, dude. Well, then hurry the fuck up and help me. Fuck you! You greedy fuck, get the money! You wanna fucking get out of here, get the fucking money. Fuck! Don't fucking move. No cell phones, nothing. Nobody move. I'll take that. Thank you very much. Fuck it. Let's go, you cry baby. - Goddamn it! Damn. Stay down! This shelter, it's a legacy. As long as it stays open, her memory will last. All clear. Good man. Officer! Officer, please, you have to help me! You have to help me. Um-- You have to help me. Please, my husband. He's-- No, I'm not a, uh-- Officer! No, I'm off-duty. What? What kind of cop are you? Okay, I need you to-- I need you to calm down. Huh? Um... Okay, look, I need you to calm down. Okay? Where is he? He's over here. Okay. He's here. He's over here. They're over there. Over here. You're weak... Hands up! Yeah, hands! Go. Get out of here! Now, hands against the wall. Now! All right. Now, spread 'em. All right, now you all have the right to remain silent. And anything... What's this? This? Huh? ...you say will be used against you in the court of law. - That's it. Kick his ass. - Yeah, kick his ass. No. No, no. Uh, all right. Oh, no. This is what happens when you do not show respect. I am an officer of the law. Okay, get on your knees. Get on your knees and kiss the ground! Kiss the ground. Kiss it! Comply and you'll survive. Okay. No. I mean, answer me this. You guys think the world would be a better place without you in it? Huh? I mean, what do you do? No, man. No. No. Make this country better than it was yesterday. I got your answer right here. If they had had complied, they would have been alive. Hello? Who is it? You won't believe the day I fucking had. What happened? Some guy dressed up as a cop shot four guys in Van Nuys. Not one made it. Did they find the shooter? Not yet. But they will. I mean, guy was dressed up as a cop acting like he was gonna arrest them. The police don't know shit about his motive. Damn. It isn't fair. Well, maybe it'll keep the cops on their toes. Shake things up a bit. Don't say that, man. Why? Oh, you think they care about us? The sons pay for the sins of their fathers. Nothing's changed. Okay? My father taught me that. I remember the day that I told him I wanted to be a cop. And he gave me the biggest backhand of my life, and knocked me down on the floor. Told me the cops are our enemies. And, uh, you know, they're just pigs. Descendants from slave owners who prosecuted runaway slaves. Like the War of Independence, uh, that's for this country's taxes and the American Civil War, well, that's like, you know, they freed the slaves, but no one's really free. We're not free. We-- We'll never be free. Doesn't matter who we are, they'll sell us the same fucking American dream. And it's sad. It-- It's so sad. It's just-- It's about money. And guys like, what, Sean Beston? You know, he's-- he's just a-- He's a slave owner. And the cops? His goons. I'm sorry you feel that way. Yeah. It is what it is. I-- I thought I got over this a long time ago. See you. Vinny, where's the fucking money? Who's this guy? Didn't know he's a fucking cop. No son of mine is a cop. What the fuck you wearing, son? It's not the uniform that makes the man. The man that makes his own luck. Don't throw my fucking words back in my face. Halloween is next October. You can dress up then. You want to help? Start with meal prep. Well... we can change the world. I mean, cops, they lock up kids every day, but this? This is real. This shelter stops kids from becoming these two. This is our chance. How long before the, uh-- the lights go out in this place for good? Where there's a will, there's a way. I'm talking about real action. You know? A real way to make change. Maybe your new associates can help. Go on. Beston Bank and Trust. What about it? Their security system, it's all over the place. The guards, they're arrogant. I-- I can get us in. So? We hit it. When you look outside, I mean, do you see the American dream, or do you see someone else's? Embarrass the city and make some cheese? I can fuck with that. We live in a society where there is nothing more American than making money on the Fourth of July. Casey Rhodes should be rotting in jail. Could you be positive for once? Hey, I'm a fountain of good vibes, brother Knight. If it isn't dumb and dumber. Barney Rubble and this caveman. What's his name again? Can't believe you forgot Fred's name. Come on, we're on soft duty. -That isn't real. -Ah, soft duty is one beer above hard duty, and three below "let's party." Fucking degenerates. One of you should be in jail, and the other in the chair. Have you got a problem? If I did, what would you do? Happy Fourth. Yeah. Thank you, douche bags. Shit! I'll meet you in the car. All right, let's do this. You ready? You lucky son of a bitch. One time I'd rather still be in the chair. Hey! You guys know you're going to jail for the rest of your lives, right? Well, I-- All right, I'm just playing. All right, what do you got here? What is that, a Roman candle? Let me see that thing. Listen, if you guys are gonna light these off... ...you gotta be safe about it. - Because you could do some real damage with one of these things. You understand? I want you to point 'em in the air. Not at people, not at animals, not at dogs. You understand? If I see you pointing this at a dog, I'm gonna curb stomp you in front of your grandmother. Do you understand? All right, good. Oh. Mmm. Whoo! Yes? Did you speak with her? She will reach out whenever she's ready to talk to you. Just want to make sure that she's okay. Just tell me where she's living. She's got a boyfriend. I-- What? Who? Oh, don't go all super-dad now. If not now, when? How's the new guy? You don't get to ask questions like that. I'm just saying. You can do better. If he treats you right, I'll support that. All I want is for you and our girl to be happy and safe. That's all. Do you think we, uh, could have, uh, ever worked? You put the job first. And I'm not blaming you, I'm not. Just the hours. It was no way to raise a family. We were like, uh, ships passing through the night. Yeah. Yeah, we were going for the same-- Yeah, the same iceberg. Hey, did you give her the bear? When I see her, I will. Happy Fourth, Detective. - Hey, honey. - Hi. Dad's been trying to get a hold of you. Why? He's your father. And fathers do care about the well-being of their children. Occasionally. He's sorry he missed your birthday. Yeah, and didn't he get me this exact same one last year? You're his little princess. Whatever. Thank you. Okay. Oh. You are your father's child. Mm-hmm. You happy now? Yeah, three more of those and I will be. Mm-hmm. And nice of you to dress up, too. I'm on call. Wanna do shots? No. These are Mike's work friends. Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. We wouldn't want to embarrass him. Mm-mmm. Okay. To being a problem child. Oh, no. To good parenting. Mm-mmm, mm-mmm. Oh. Oh. Why did you make me do that? That's so good. No. Yeah. No. Go, Mom. Go, Mom. Yeah! Happy Fourth, Officer. Happy Fourth. -Indeed. -What can I do for you? I'm here to do a 6-8-9. Well, we've never been better. Well, I, um-- I'm just here to check up on you, sir. Well, that's very kind of you. But all is well. All is well. You'd be doing me a favor if you let me inside, so I can see for myself. What are you doing? Oh, you! Hey, there's two back there! - Fucker-- - Want to let me inside? Fucker! Stay back! Stay back, you motherfuckers! Drop it, drop it. Get back! Put your weapons down! Back! Get-- Open it up. Open up! Open it up! I am about to live my American dream. Mr. Beston, please stay where you are. Guards, put down your guns. You're free to go. Fuck it! You're fucking crazy. Do you remember me?

Oh, this keeps getting fucking better. Drop the fucking gun! Shoot this fucking asshole. Let her go. I said, let her go. It wasn't supposed to be like this! I gave everything I had to this country. I tried playing by the rules, and look where it fucking got me. You think that? You're brainwashed if you think I'm the bad guy. They don't pay me to judge. No. You're just a sicario with a badge. You shoot anyone they tell you to. The government? The government-- The government is the biggest gang in town. Put the gun down. I would've been the best cop this city has ever had. You've got no right to wear that uniform. The badge, it doesn't-- it doesn't make the man. You don't think I could've been a good cop, if I just had a fucking chance? There's no cure for being an asshole. All I wanted was to be the good guy. That's it. We play the cards we're dealt. Sometimes we win, and sometimes we bite it. Fuck you. Ally! I got you. Ally! Please! Tell them I'm a good guy. Tell them. Ally! It's okay. I'm not gonna shoot. I'm the good guy. I'm the good guy. I'm the good-- Happy Fourth, motherfucker!
