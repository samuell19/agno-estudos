[PRAYER OF ORDINATION CEREMONY] Aod. What’s wrong? Nightmare? No. What is it? Why don’t you tell me? There’s nothing. Aod. Whoever takes what’s mine must die! PEE NAK 3 DO MIN JOON Give me your hands. Already washed. Is it true that your argument with friends breaking up the band? I wouldn’t ask that kind of question. What is your channel? Sky News. Sky News? - Sky New! Okay, go ahead. - Sky News! Very good. Great start. Wait a second. The company will announce about this later. Do Min Joon is very tired. We really have to go. - Come on, stay a little longer. - No, he is very tired. He is very tired. She told you. We should leave now. Please move. Move. Make way. Make way please. Don’t push. No. No. Hold up. Go. Go. Go! Where are you, Yot? Where is the van? Hurry up. Accident? How are we gonna get back? Hurry up. Go. No. Please. Stop. Calm down, calm down. Take it easy, keep your distance. Hey! Why are you standing on the road? Wanna die, assholes? Huh? PAMPAM OPPA CHANNEL VS DO MIN JOON What a chance! Wait for me, wait, wait. Do Min Joon. Do Min Joon. What the hell? Give me a minute. Give me a minute. Stop. Stop. [SPEAKING IN GIBBERISH] Gotcha! I studied Korean, you see. Awesome, First. Go get him. Why? Just take a selfie. No photos. I said no photos. That is Do Min Joon. I'm a youtuber called Pampam. I don’t know. Where are you going? Want a ride? Let’s go. Yes. Let’s go. Guard him. Guard him. Guard him. Guard him. Guard him. Guard him. Hurry up. It was chaotic at the mall. You won’t pass the probation like this? - So many fans, Shon. - Oh my god! This place is worn-out. We tried our best. Are we staying here? Greeting, Luanglung. Be well. We are here to visit Phra Nhong and attend Aod’s ordination. But… we can’t reach Phra Nhong. Phra Nhong has gone to India for about a month. I’m taking care of everything now. Didn’t he tell you? Yes, he did. We were just on tours and have just returned to Thailand. Hey, Fahlun. Where are Aod and novice Nott? They would have been standing here making noise. If it weren’t from Phra Nhong, we wouldn’t know that he would be ordained. Well… we have to hold off the ordination. The thing is… Aod is not well. Will you watch your steps? Are you supposed to be mom or dad? Mommy, of course. We have boobs, and this! With that, you can’t call us dad. And that handsome man behind you, your husband? Don’t say that in the temple. No, novice. I’m the bottom. Hey! Stop joking. Actually, the three of us were ordained here. You are ugly when you lie. Hey, novice. Better grow up soon and leave the monastery. So you can be my man. Let me see if you are ready. Is your junk ready? Let me see. Let me. Just a little. Let me see. Help. Novice Nott. Nott. Nott. Nott. What are you doing? Fast growing, big thingy. You said you’d die. And here you are, Aod. Hello. Each time I meet you… you always have a new nose. My new series. Beautiful, isn’t it? Did a shaman do it? It doesn’t go with your face. Piss off. And First, how long do you have left to live? You have the same old foul mouth. I don’t think you are ill at all. But you are still the same. Cute as always. Aww. Aren’t you sweet? How have you been doing, Min Joon? I’m fine. Let me introduce you to someone here. This is Shon, my manager and the boss of First and Balloon. I’m Min Joon's friend. We are friends. - That’s enough. - We are friends. That’s enough. Keep your mouth shut. Shut it. Nott, these aunties were harassing me. Who were harassing you? That would be enough. Apologize to them. Why should I? Novice. You should apologize when you did wrong. Apologize to them. Come on. I’m sorry. This is novice Namnua. His parents got divorce and his dad moved to work in the city. He is left to be ordained here. I assigned him to take care of Aod. How about other novices? They left the monastery to continue their education. Novice Nott has just got accepted at the Buddhist University in Bangkok. Wait. Wait. Wait. This is an ill person? How? You don’t seem ill at all. What a cry baby. That is really ill. Yes, Aod is ill. Aod is ill. Aod is ill. - Aod. This is serious. - I think it’s serious. This is serious. You're a serious issue. Damn. Go. Since I found this anklet, I’ve had bad dreams. And these scales… started growing on my chest… until last month… It’s painful. Hot, and it burns so that I have a fever and always feel ill. No! Don’t touch. I’m just curious. Will it be over if you just throw it away? Or leave it at where it was found. Bury it, so this could end. Why would Aod keep it if it was that easy? You chatterbox. Luanglung. Aod found an anklet and is cursed like Nak in the dream. Luanglung. What do you know about the anklet? Giving anklets to Nak before ordination is the temple's tradition since the start of the establishment which has been passed on for hundreds of years. Everyone, look closely. What does it say? I can't read it. Looks like ancient texts. - Pampam. - Yes? Can you enlarge the image and show it to Luanglung? Let me see. You are “the oldest” here. Can you read it? I’m not that old to know these scriptures. I can’t read it. Alright. You stay together tonight. I’m going. Please, sir. Please, Luanglung. Said he’s not that old. [ANCIENT PAMPHLET] "This ring which Nak takes off when…” What’s next? Scripts on the back already faded. It can’t be read. I think the rest of the scripts might give us a hint. Novice. Can you try to rub it? You might see the rest on the back. Can you? There’s nothing. If can’t see from this one, let’s look at the other. There is only one. I agree with novice Namnua. If it’s Nak's anklet, there must be a pair. The scripts might be perfect on the other one. Why is there only one then? Aod, why is there only one? It's just that. I went back digging many times but didn’t find anything. Kiddee called me yesterday. Said one of his relatives went to an ordination at a temple by Mekong. At that temple, their Nak also wears anklets like we do here. Aod and I decided to visit Kiddee in Ubon and meet with his relative. Let me go with you. No, you can't. It’s so dangerous and too risky. What if someone took a footage of you again? I have a van. I can take you there. You are the worst and the weirdest. You'd like to record and post Min Joon's clip on Youtube. There are rules. And you should respect our rules. You can’t keep filming everything. It sounds strange when you talk about rules. We are professionals now. Very well. Song Hee. I beg you. Just a few days. I’m worried about them, really. I’m sure you can handle it. The sooner we go, the sooner we're back. Right? Please. Okay. But as a professional manager… First, Balloon… take a good care of Min Joon. If anyone record a video, use extreme measure. - Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am. Stop that. [CHANTING] I wish this merit reaches all spirits in the world. I wish them rest in peace. [CHANTING] I wish this merit reaches all animals in the world I wish all demons in the world rest in peace I wish the merit from this prayer reaches all spirits that I have offended from the past to the present no matter where you are. Please receive this merit, forgive me for my sin and bless me with the power of this good deed. Aod. Aod! What’s happening? Let's get to bed. Does it hurt? Be easy on his wound. Aod. - Careful. - Slowly. [CHANTING] Are you alright, Aod? - Let's get to bed. - Take it easy. Aod. Aod. Aod! Aod! Aod! What? What? A ghost! Ghost! Ghost! Aren’t you a novice? Perform an exorcism. I can’t. I never succeed. Who stole what’s mine. I’ll kill you. Shon, you bitch! The anklet. The anklet at his ankle… looks like mine. What the hell? I can’t take this. Let’s go. Shit! Which way should we go? Come this way. Let him stand there like an idiot. Come all the way from Korea, and still stupid. What the hell? The door! Aod. Aod. Aod. Luangpee! Novice! Novice. Luangpee! Novice. Novice. Balloon. Novice. Are you okay? You want the anklet so bad, huh? Come and take it! Aod. They have nothing to do with this. Aod, what are you saying? Aod. You want this? Aod, what are you saying? Why would you risk yourself with him? You are not a part of this. I took the anklet. It’s my responsibility. You let them go and come take it from me. The four of you… you have stolen my precious. I’ll kill you. Namnua. Novice, what are you doing? Novice, why did you get in? Your heart is full of grudge. Don’t come closer. Novice, come back. It pulled me. First. Everyone, it is open. What are you waiting for? Go! Novice, let’s get out. - Let’s go. - Let’s go, Aod. Aod. Go. Pampam. Go. I can’t feel my legs. Pampam. Hurry up. My anklet! Novice. Wake up, Namnua. Wake up. Go and wake up everyone. Wake up. It’s morning. First. Balloon. No. Balloon. Balloon. Shit! In the chapel, really? You were all over me last night, First. Are you sure? I’m having a period. Aod, let me ask. Is this Nak ghost haunting every night? I can’t do this every night. No, it is the first time since Aod found that gold anklet. This is the first time I saw him. It’s the same ghost I saw in my dream. And he mentioned all four of us. Four of us? Which four? Is it me? Is it me? You are just a kitten. Or is it me? But I’m Korean. You never know. Where are you going? I'm not involved. It’s my first time visiting this place. "First time visiting this place." That’s what we thought. And then? Let me tell you this, we are all here because in the past… we might have met before. We might have done something together. I’m talking from my experience. Oh, there you are. Luanglung and I looked for you guys everywhere. Luanglung. Why do you look worn-out? A ghost, Luanglung. There is a new ghost. And a dead Korean… does it have anything to do with this? Are you still awake? Bitch! Crystal clear. Still alive. And the dead Korean you mentioned… who is it? It’s all done. - Thank you. - Thank you. Is it Shon's body? Can you call the office to inform about the body and the police as well. If this news gets out, it will be a big mess. Hurry up, so we can go with Aod. You still want to go with Aod? That ghost has just killed Shon. That’s right. That ghost is evil. He’d kill just anybody. I’m scared, Min Joon. This is the reason why I think it’s best we stick together so we can help each other. Give me that, Aod. Here, one more. I really think it’s dangerous. If Nak is looking for the anklet, I should just go with novice Nott. It’s dangerous everywhere. Everybody might have something connected to Nak. We go together to support each other. Alright, everybody? Yes. When you said everybody… can you leave me out of that? So hurry to be excluded. You were the first that wanted to come and now you want to leave. Be careful of being alone, the ghost will snap your neck. We still don’t know about when he said about the four of us, which ones of us are those four. Just come along, so you can be safe. Come down and film your stupid Oppa video. Come on. Let’s go. Please come down, novice. Novice! I know! Move. Novice. Come down. No, I’ll come along. Novice. - Come down. - Why not, Aod? It’ll be just a few days. That’s right. It’s dangerous and you know it. Come on, novice. Wait. Only you come down. The Buddha statue… stays there. Novice. Novice. They are taking my photos. Yeah. Yeah. Good morning. I knew it. Pampam. You posted about Min Joon on social media, didn’t you? That’s why everyone is staring at us. Are you crazy? I’ve been driving all day. Hold on. I don’t think they are Min Joon’s fans. Is it me? I agree. You and me? You and me? They are pointing at something on the roof. On the roof? Shit! What? Are you possessed again? A leg. Where? - That's novice. - Careful. Careful. Novice. - Oh my god. - Novice. How did you get here? - Get up. - Careful. Are you hurt? Novice. Get up. My van. My van. Novice. Get down. Get down, please. Please get down. I’m sorry. Let me hang on this, alright? - Novice. - Novice, get down. Get him. Go get him. It’s crowded here. Get down. - No! - Get down. No! - Get him. - No! - No! It’s crowded. Come down. - Come down! - No! No to you as well Namnua. Go away! - Pampam. Hurry. - Everybody. Pampam. People are crowding us. Just take Namnua with us. At Kiddee’s house, we can take him off our hands. - Okay. - Yay! Thank you, Min Joon. Be patient. When we arrive Wat Nak Nimitr, Luang por can revoke the curse. Who stole what’s mine. I’ll kill you. Klae, wait for me. Aod What’s wrong? Startled. I had a bad dream. I think you ate too much. Aod’s dreams are never good. Hello, Kiddee. What’s up? Novice Nott, come on. Why do we have to come to this cemetery? It’s spooky. Kiddee’s uncle died. So we have to meet him there. Kiddee’s uncle died? What's on earth is happening? Under the seat, bitch. I can’t find it. What do you usually ride? My vagina is rocked. Just a moment. Let me call Kiddee. That kid? Look. It's fucking abandoned. No… Hello everyone. Long time no see. How are you, Min Joon? I’m good. And you, Aod? You must be Pampam. Hello. Nice to meet you, Novice Nott. The both of you just forget it! Do you know what we… were thinking? Cute school boy. I can hear your thoughts. I’m single, here with friends for business. You guys are brave, risking yourselves to help Aod. But I think you underestimate the situation coming here to fight Nak with nothing. I think it’s risky. Yeah, he is worried about us. I think he likes you. Don’t blush. One moment. Why is he bending? Please, First, Balloon. Aod, have a seat. I think this is a really tough situation. You guys should prepare your bodies, minds, and insurances to guarantee your success. I love you all. I want you guys to be prepared. But Kiddee, my friend… Shut up, Balloon. Go on. This is what we were talking about, making a life insurance. So you can be insured. But I don’t have… …a pen. You didn’t prepare it. I know. Here you go. Go on. But I think it’s quite… quite dark? Is this bright enough? But I don’t have… …any cash. Mobile banking. It is satisfying. Sign here. It’s done, First. Now I think You don't have to be worried about getting hurt or dying. Now you can die, First. Come here. I heard that my uncle’s mother put all of his belongings in the coffin because he was very possessive. I think his phone is in it. Who’d go to get it? Why do they howl this hour? Mama? Mama! Everytime, these shitty lights! You’ve been here before? Every movie is like this. Dogs howl, lights out. Typical. Run! First. This way.

You stay out of this. Aod. Don’t let him possess you. You’ll end up leaving me. Nobody is gonna leave you. I, for one. You are accepted in the university. You’ll leave him. Even though everyone leaves you, but I won’t. Novice! Novice! Aod! Aod! Aod, get yourself together. That’s Namnua. Namnua! Namnua! Let go. Why are you fighting with him? I have to take the anklet from him. Or I have to put him out. Pampam, help. Aod! Novice! Novice! Novice! Catch! Pampam, help novice Nott. - You stay here. - It hurts. Just a moment. Do something. - Easy, novice. Easy. - It hurts. Your hip too? First. Balloon. Where is Pampam? In the building. What? Where is my anklet? It’s not here. Aod, what’s the matter? I saw that you took it. - I said I don’t have it. - Aod. - Aod. - It has to be here. Aod. The anklet is here. I have it wrapped up. Nobody touched it. I used to call you guys trouble makers. Right now, I am the trouble maker. Aod… It’s because the ghost possessed you. You are also not well, so your mind becomes weak the ghost found it was easy to possess you. Aod. Listen to me. We all are worried for you. We won't leave you. Aod. Aod. Don’t worry. Novice Namnua understands. Novice. Come back to your sense, Aod? Do you feel better? Still hurt anywhere? Novice. I’m sorry. There’s nothing to apologize for. I broke your arm. The ghost did. Just worry about yourself. Let’s get going. - Don't rush. - Take it easy. Stay still. Does it hurt? Novice. Kiddee called your mother. She will be here soon. But if I don’t go, who will help Aod? I’ll go with you guys. Novice, it’s too hard for you. Don’t push yourself. If anything happened to you, we’ll be heartbroken that we didn’t stop you. I will come back to pick you up soon. The sun! Where is Min Joon? He went to recover the van with the old man that helped us last night. It’s Min Joon. Hello, Min Joon. Yes. Yes. Balloon… Hello, Min Joon. Your voice! Yes. Faster, faster. Yeah, almost. Excellent! Excuse me. Do we really take this vehicle? Yes… This is my Cyclone 100. I don’t use it often. You guys can take it and I will find a mechanic to fix your van. Whenever you are done with your business, take it back to me. Take it as an exchange, okay? Thank you, uncle. - Sure. - Guys, let me drive! Go ahead. I’ll call the mechanic. Good luck. Good luck. Thank you. Good bye. Good bye. Come on. Let’s go. Get on. Come on. Everybody hop on. Min Joon. Hurry up. Don’t be stubborn. You are stubborn. Hop on. Come on. Come on. Let’s go. Hop on. Why is he so hyped? I’m a fast driver. Hold tight. Pampam. Come on. Guys. I’m not going. What now? I’m scared. Why would I take a risk with you guys? If we meet the ghost again, you all will leave me. Pampam, I know that you are scared and don’t trust us. But we want you to come because we’re worried for you. We don’t want you to end up like… like Shon. Hey. Come with us. We are already on the same boat. Together, we’ll survive, Mr. Oppa. Come. Ready. Go! That way, Min Joon. Sorry. Is that okay? The temple is over there. WAT NAK KHUM Wat Nak Toom Hey, Nak… That is Wat Nak Khum. The temple as in Gim’s phone. Thank heavens. We are finally here. Luang Por… is there a tradition at this temple… Look at how he said “Luang Por”. Just speak with normal accent. People struggle enough without the accent. Don’t bully him. Luang Por. Is there a tradition about wearing anklets? We still do. We found a haunting anklet. And we are here to study the legend, hoping to revoke the curse. Aod, show the anklet to Luang Por. This one. Luang Por! Don’t touch it. It is cursed. If you touch it, the scales will start… growing on your body, it burns. The ghost will come after you. I’m warning you. So you bring it to Luang Por to revoke the curse? Yes. Luang Por, please help us. Prin, bring the anklet for them to see. Alright. Finito. This anklet is similar to the one from our temple. But… there are no scripts like Aod’s. Wait a second. Can you see this photo? Is there any temple that has an arched entrance like this? Something ancient like this, is only at the deserted temple called “Wat Nak Nimit” on the mountain. Old people said that the Naga built it. Now it’s just a deserted temple. Don’t go there. You won’t find anyone. Min Joon, pull over. - Min Joon. - Stop. - Stop. - Let me find the location. What did you say, Aod? I think this is it. What is “it”? Just follow me. Aod, you can always get me excited. No better place to go? Have sunscreen with you? What else? This is it. That rock field… where I saw Nak running from something in my dream before he jumped off the cliff. Be patient. When we arrive Wat Nak Nimit, Luang Por can undo the curse. Klae, wait for me. You stole what’s mine, You must die. Juk was washed up here and looked up to the mountain before he saw fire. Wait, guys. This mountain, Luang Por said there is a deserted temple. According to Google Map, the mountain is quite high. From what I see, I think it’s upside down. Sorry, First. It doesn’t seem so high now. Quite low actually. Are you alright, Aod? I think in the past, your anklet… might be around here. Since we are already here, let’s try to find it. Let’s go. Alright, Aod? Yes. Aod. My anklet. - Aod. - Aod. What’s wrong? Nak hurts me. That means the side I’m hurt is the direction where the anklet is. Let’s hurry and find it. Pampam, take Aod to rest in the shade. The rest of us split and look for the anklet. It should be quicker. The ghost chased me to high mountain recess area. Let me go. I give up. I give up. And I died there. Do you remember that mountain recess? How does it look like? That’s too detailed. Just find a mountain recess with skeletons. Are you scared? Yeah. Want to hold this? Np, you have an amulet. Careful. Get up, mama. I’m sure. I’m sure. I know. Over there! Your nails are still beautiful, mama. Not about my nails. The skeletons right there. Dinosaur skeletons! We are rich, First. We are rich. Oh, fuck! They are human skeletons. Hurry up, Aod. Hey… Aod? Aod! Are you sure? Look at his eyes. Don’t you remember? There are no eyes there. And this hair style he wore when he was younger. He literally looks like a monk with bald head. Yes. See? Now you can’t argue with me. You saw what I saw, First. I didn’t. I just saw this. The anklet. Pick it up. You pick it up. I can’t. You are closer to it. How am I gonna reach it? Okay, I’m out of the way. You pick it up. You saw it first. You pick it up. Why should I? - You saw it later. You pick it… - First. I got it. Get out! Novice! Hurry up! Hurry. Shit! Let him go. You stole what’s mine, You must die. Hurry up. Come on. Novice. Get out. You must die. Hurry up! novice! Novice! Let’s go. Novice, come on. Hurry up. What happened? Help! What’s going on? Help! What happened? Go, novice. Just leave. Let’s go. What? What’s going on? Let’s go. Let’s go. Nak’s ghost is here. Hurry up, Aod. Wait. Wait. Wait. Aod, come here. Is he following us? Let's go. Run, bitch, run. Who stole what's mine I'll kill you. Aod! Novice. Are you alright? I’m okay. I only lost balance. Aod! Aod. - Be careful. - Are you alright? I’m alright. Go. I think we should take some rest. Let’s continue. Before the ghost catches up. Don’t worry, novice. We have a Buddha statue. Pampam, show! Here you go! Buddha is gone! Pampam! Shit! Where did you keep it? Where has it gone? Where did it go? How careless! Wait, where has it gone? You stole what’s mine. You must die. Wait for Aod. Aod. Hurry up. Aod I know. Wait for Aod. - Aod! - Aod! Wait for me. Hurry up. My anklet. That’s a fire, guys. The fire. Is that a ghost too? Let’s get there first. - Go. - Go, everyone. Guys. The fire. The fire. Be careful. Is it this way? Balloon, be careful. Pampam. Watch the fire. Guys, let’s go. Hurry up. Aod, careful. Aod. Are you alright? Yes， I’m alright. Aod! Aod. Come on. I’ll help you. Hold my arm. Guys. This way. Aod, come on. It’s itchy. I don't want to be at the back. Is that a monk? Better ask, is that a human? Are you a human? I’m a monk. On a pilgrimage and staying here tonight. He’s really a monk, First. Hurry up. Luang Por! Luang Por! Please help! Luang Por! Please help us. The ghost has been following us. Very well. I think we should treat that young man first. Aod. [CHANTING] How are you? Is it better? I feel better. Can I have a look at your anklet? Just hand it over. It’s alright. You know about this anklet? It belongs to the big temple on the mountain. So, there is a temple on this mountain? Yes, there is. Long time ago, there was a temple on the mountain. And this mountain has been protected by Naga. He was quite mischievous and had hurt so many people until villagers fled. Then there was a monk that accepted the invitation from villagers to subdue the Naga. It took him seven days and seven nights. The Naga finally surrendered. He promised to turn his life around. He redeemed himself for hurting humans and harassed the monks by building a big temple and dedicated it to that monk. He also made gold anklets for Nak as a merit to support Nak to become a monk. Although the temple is deserted now, the Nak-anklet tradition before ordination is still practised by temples around here. Luang Por... The ghost is still in my head. I’m afraid that I’ll be possessed. That I won’t be strong enough to fight it. The strength you have is not only from yourself but also from your friends for not leaving you. You are not fighting alone. But Luang Por, we once had a Buddha statue to fight ghosts. It is lost now, no where to be found. Can you give us something to fight? You think the ghost is scared of the Buddha statue? If it’s not for the Buddha statue, why does it not hurt us when it saw the Buddha statue? Or he is scared of something else inside? Alright. I don't think you should overthink into it. Rest here tonight. This is a sacred place. No ghost will come across. Yes, Luang Por. Aod, you have another story, haven’t you? I think we should tell Luang Por. I’ll find Luang Por. Just a moment. Yeah, make yourself useful. Luang Por. Everyone, Luang Por is not here. His belonging is all gone. - All gone? - All of it. Everything is gone. Everything is gone? No, no. Nothing is here. No candles, nothing. Luang Por, the temple, the monk… Cave! Are any of these real? Am I real? I’m sure you are real. But your nose is fake. That hurts, asshole. I’m sorry, Min Joon. Well, you asked. Maybe Luang Por went out to collect the alms. You sleep like the dead… like rehearse dying. Let’s get Aod to the temple. Let’s go. Go. Let’s go. Thank you. Do you know where we are going? Head north, Balloon. You know the direction. North. How is it going? Are you alright? What is it? Are you okay? Yes. This way, guys. You go ahead. Min Joon. Are you alright? I lost all energy. Guys, wait a moment for First. Balloon. Keep going. Hurry up, First, before we get lost. Keep going. Watch your hands. What with my hands? Balloon is so loud. I’m sure we can find them. Falling for someone. Not funny. Come on. Get up. Holy smokes. Oh, you care about me. Kiddee, are we lost? This is the way, Balloon. It’s the shortcut. I can hear you before you get here. First, how did you get here? Kiddee! What’s the point of a compass? I’m sorry, Balloon. I’m aching everywhere. Look, guys! This is laterite. It’s not found naturally. What is it? Here, there’s a block of it. First! You are so stupid. Don’t you know laterite? Look at me. I don’t have a geologist husband. That means… there must be an ancient site hidden here. Is this the ancient arched entrance? This… is what I saw in my dream. It looks like the entrance at our temple. Exactly the same. Hello! Can you revoke a curse? Any promotion? Like… revoke the curse with free exorcism? We’ll take one. We’ll take one. Why are you fooling around? Look at him. Aod! - Let me help. - I’m okay. I’m okay. Let’s get inside. Let’s go. Balloon, come on. What are you waiting for? Hurry up, guys. Play football? Let’s go. First, there are some people here. Make sure they are humans. Maybe they can help Aod. Go. Excuse me. Excuse me. Please help. Our friend is ill. Can you help him? How did you get here? Here he is. Aod. The curse… of Nak’s anklet. Nak Kham! How are you? - The same monk? - Yes. Does the ghost still bother you? Not anymore. But my wound still hurts. Like he is still somewhere near. What is the deal with the anklet, Luang Por? And about someone called "Nak Kham"? The deserted temple you saw used to be a big temple. It’s called Wat Nak Nimit. [CHANTING] The villagers along Mekong… when they celebrate ordination, the monk at that temple to perform for them. Nak Kham was an orphan. Reverence… Kham is burglarizing again. I have to bring him in this time. I'm an orphan. Who do I turn to? Just this much, can you spare some? Reverence took you in and raised you You still dare to call yourself an orphan? You bastard. You have no respect for him. Please spare him. I’m asking you. I might not teach you well enough. That’s why you are greedy. To commit sins and give yourself an excuse that you did it because you don’t have as much doesn’t give you the right reason. It makes you go down even deeper. Reverence, We’ll tie him with a plank and drag him to the authority later. No, reverence. During the next moon, there will be a big ordination at the Naga temple. Let me be ordained to repay what I did. He is right. For the sake of Buddhism, let the Naga discipline him. I think, it’s better than making him a convict. But it didn’t come from his heart to become a monk. He wanted to go to the capital so he planed to steal the gold anklets then ran away. That’s why he was cursed and it caused him ichthyosis, and suffered to death. This young man must be cursed for the wrongful possession. Is there a way to revoke the curse? There is only way. Return the anklets to the Naga. How do we do it? Isn’t it written on the anklets? On the other anklet we found, is there anything written on it? Yes. - What does it say? - What does it say? “The anklets that Nak is wearing, when they are removed, you’ll become a monk.” The ghost has been harassing Aod because he doesn’t want Aod to become a monk. Because if Aod succeeds, it will revoke the curse. How about this… we let Aod wears anklets, become a monk and revoke the curse. Yeah. That is not possible. You still have ties with him. Ties of karma that you committed with him in the past life. If you can’t remove those ties, you can’t be a monk. The anklets are the symbol of ties in the world of mundane, both good karma and bad karma. If you can’t let go of these ties, you can’t be prosperous in Dharma. So that means… to take the anklets off, we must let go of ties in our mind first or we can’t be a monk? No ties, no concerns... then you can be a monk. I see. A cliff at the back of the village, there is a holy reservoir. Put on Nak’s attire and the anklets. Go wash your body there. [CHANTING] [CHANTING] Awesome. Why don’t we just go to the flower market? It's an eight day walk. Excuse me. Yes? Please take this yellow robe to make merit. Of course. Thank you. We will pray for you. Sathu. I have a gossip. Don't you think this village is weird? There are only young people and no elderly people. There is only one that looks like a village chief. On the top of that, there are no kids. That’s good. When mama sees them, the Korean looking guys around here, I love it. Don’t get me suspicious. Just stay put. How are you? Did you wash yourself in the reservoir? I did. That’s good. But it can relieve the curse for just a while. Aod. Do you know how we can take the anklets off? I don’t know. But I feel sorry for Nak Kham. Without you guys, I might be just like him. Hey, Aod. He lived by taking advantage of others, stealing from others, he is no different from criminals. He only blames others and never looks into himself. Yeah. I think those who only think of the benefit won’t get sympathy from others. That’s right. We should not forgive ourselves but we should ask for forgiveness. That’s true. Even during the ordination, there is a part of apologize to all vengeful spirits. Right, apologize to a ghost. You’ll get your neck snapped before you know it. Why do you take it off? We are willing to apologize to him, we should let him see our true intention. I and everybody here want to apologize for stealing what’s yours and I will be ordained. I won’t let you! We are here in good faith. We are aware of our wrongdoings. You… stole what’s mine. You will be like me! But the anklets don’t belong to you. The anklets are mine! You took them off from my ankles. Do you remember? The Naga anklets. Nak… you should let go of these anklets. Wherever you took them from, take them back. No. I won’t. I will die with my precious anklets. The anklet curse… nobody can help you if you won’t help yourself. Remember that. I ask for permission to leave the monkhood. Please recognize me that I’m now a layman. Juk, Klae. You are stealing from corpses again? We didn’t. We didn’t. Let’s go then. Get the boat. Yes. What are you waiting for? Get the other one. You stole what’s mine. Whoever took what’s mine must die! You are dying already. Don’t be stingy. At your ankle, give it to me. Give it back to me. Novice. Anklet. Juk. Just give it back to him. Give me. - No. - It's mine! The anklet is mine. Juk! Take it. Hey. Hey. How come the event from previous life affect us in this life? Luang Por, it’s a different life. What do you think about yesterday, today, and tomorrow? How are they connected? They are all connected. That’s right. It’s like the same piece of fabric. All connected. Today is yesterday’s future. And the consequence of our actions today… affects tomorrow. We have to accept the consequence because you can’t go back in time to fix yesterday. I won’t let… you take off my anklets. Please forgive us. Please let Aod go. No. All of you have to die like me. Aod has admitted his wrongdoings. We are asking for forgiveness with good faith and we should… Stop! We are asking for forgiveness I said stop! I will kill him and make him suffer. Stop, Nak. Luang Por. Aod. Luang Por. When they are asking for your forgiveness, why don’t you let go of the ties and forgive them? Why am I the only one who has to become this? Why do you help them but not me? And you… you performed ordination for me. I have helped you but you don’t help yourself. Please stop. I’m asking to hold back the extreme punishment. Please give him a chance to repent the same way it happened to you. And you… if you really accept your mistake and apologize to the anklets’ owner, you will survive. No. I’m not giving them back. You are unjust. Those who wear anklets, who dedicate themselves to Buddhism, the Naga will protect them… Who wear the anklet If they ever dare to become enemy of Buddhism, The Naga will destroy them. Like how you declared yourself as a protector of Buddhism. My anklet. Long time ago... The Naga accepted his mistake. That’s why he created these anklets to remind the later generations to accept their mistakes in the past. As for you… after you take off the anklets, you can become Nak, then a monk. [CHANTING] For the merit of my ordination this time, I want to dedicate it to every Nagas and Nak Kham. No ties, no concerns. Be prosperous in Dhamma. And everyone too. Sathu. Hello, I’m Pampam Oppa.
