Did you know that in the Middle Ages they thought that the centre of intellectual operations was in the heart? Then, later on, when they continued investigating, they realised it wasn't. But rather that the soft mass we have inside our heads, the brain, is the captain of the whole ship. Today, we think we know it all. But I don't think that's true. There are many mysteries of the mind that are still hidden. There are lots of things that haven't been studied yet. You ask yourself questions, but there isn't always an answer. THE PLAN Yes... Yes, damn it, I'm coming. - It's me. - I know it's you. Do you know what time it is? - Yes, Paco. It's 09:05. Exactly, you're late. Where are you going now? - To freshen up a bit. Ramón, what are you doing? Has Andrade messaged? I don't know, Paco. I haven't got my phone. Yet another idiot who'll turn up late. I had to take the kids to school. Come on, I was only five minutes late. So, you were late. You don't know what it's like to have a bad taste in your mouth all day. What do you want me to say? - That having kids is hard work. - Having kids is hard work. Happy? - Yes. - Good. You still have the suit. Yeah, if those bastards want it, they can come collect it. - Call Andrade, Paco. - Bloody hell, Andrade. If he's not here by 9:30, sod him. I'm going to have to use some of my credit to get him here. Andrade, where the hell are you? What do you mean ten minutes? You're supposed to be here already. What are you playing at? Hey! And he hangs up. When is this photo from, Paco? What are you doing? Is that you? - Ten minutes, he said, the scumbag. - Don't worry, Paco. Relax. I can't relax, Ramón. Have you ever asked yourself why we're unemployed? What do you think? I ask myself every day. Well, it could be because, in our subconscious, we reject the concept of work. It could be, pal, that we like to be, or to feel like, victims of the society we live in. In our subconscious, of course. Victimhood gives us an identity, and we're not prepared to give that up. And, in this case, our disease, because it turns out that victimhood can be a disease, like the mumps, measles, and all those. In this case, our disease, in the form of a feeling of inferiority, gives us an identity. Get what I'm saying? Where did you get that from? From a psychology book. It helps me, you know? I read magazines and books. You learn things. Books are good for that, yeah. I always wanted to be a psychologist. You? Look, in some way, we're becoming comfortable in our role as those mistreated by capitalism. And, little by little, we're filling... Shit, Paco, I've won a prize! "Another packet of seeds." "Claim it from your shop." Psychology is doing you the world of good, Ramón. We need to go deeper into the subconscious. Yes, yes. That'll be it. Do you know Freud? Listen, I read that this man searched in his patients' subconscious or rather, in their heads, in order to... - Do you know Fran, from human resources? I can almost see him now: "Paco, between you and me, they only way to avoid lay-offs is to lower salaries". And me: "What are you saying? I'm not going to ask my colleagues...". "Yes, mate, it's between us. Don't worry. It's just temporary, we'll relaunch in no time. We've come up with a plan so that you can keep your jobs. It's just a small reduction." "How much lower do you want me to go, son of a bitch? When you only pay me a shitty 900 euros to waste 12 hours of my day sat in a fucking hut. What more do you want?". But what did we do? What did we do? We bent over and took it. Of course! Come on, for management! Again and again and again... until they fired us. All of us. Psychology books... Do you want to see what it's like to be bent over? Do you want to see what it's like to be fucking bent over? Paco! Twenty euros. They paid me twenty fucking euros to hand out flyers all morning. The photo you saw was from the trial day. I even had to do a goddamn trial to wear this! The campaign lasted two days and, at the end, they asked if I wanted the costume, as they were throwing it out. Do you know what I did? I said: "Give it here. I'll keep it". I'll sell it on Wallapop or something. Shit, Paco, mate. I just wanted to say... We need to heal - Don't start talking about healing. Do you know what I really need? I need to win. That's what I need. And today is the day. And I won't let anyone ruin it or get in my way. Whatever it costs or whoever I have to bump off, even that moron Andrade, who I'm sure will cock things up. So, please, give your psychology crap a rest! Throw the suit away, Paco. Fuck, man. What's most shocking about the mysteries of the mind is that they're infinite. I mean, the soft mass, weighing only 2% of our body, consumes 20% of our energy. But, what's going on in there? Neural connections, impulses, all that, yes. But how does that translate into behaviour, the being, the self? That's still not clear. - Where's the seed prize? - I won it, Paco. - Weren't the seeds mine? Give it to me. - Fuck. Mate! I'm also at bursting point, eh? I argued with Manoli this morning. It's bad, huh? In front of the kids. That's the worst bit. She didn't think today was a good idea, you know? I didn't want to hide it from her. I told her where I was going. I could've said I had an interview or a meeting at the job centre. I'm tired of hiding things from her. Me too. I've not said anything to Laura. - I need to tell you something. - Of course. - Shit! - Fuck! Sorry, mate. There's not that many. Do you know how hard this is to clean? Paco, I need a beer. You can't drink a beer now. It's nine in the morning. It's twenty past, Paco. - Andrade? - Open up, I'm coming up. - No, we're coming down. - Paco! Come on, Ramón. Let's move! What are you doing? - For the walk. - Let's go now! - Aren't you going to answer? - No, he drives me mad. Close the door when you leave. Come on. Ramón! Let's go! - Coming. Fuck, man, your obsession for not using the lift! It's a warm up. Weren't you listening to me? My car's fucked. - What? - I've called for recovery. It started smoking and it wouldn't start. - What colour was it? - What? - The smoke. - White. - That's the gasket. - What the hell? White smoke out of the exhaust means water has mixed with oil. The head gasket. - The head of my cock! - Good morning. - Good morning! - Fuck your mother and the plan! - Paco! Do you mind, dear? Something had to happen. The head gasket's gone, how's that my fault? - It's not. - Right. - What do we do now? - I don't know. You never know anything, do you? Let's call Emilio. Perhaps he can delay things and they can wait for us. - Let me think. - Paco, what about your car? - It's in the garage. A service. - Perhaps it's done. - It's miles away, damn it. We'll take a taxi. - Do you know how much a taxi costs? Let's take the bus. - We can't go on the bus, retard. Why don't you call Emilio? Aren't you friends? He can pick us up. I have to wait for the recovery truck. I can't leave it there. For fuck's sake! I'm not going back up. I'm going on the metro. Paco, call Emilio. - Come on. Call Emilio, Paco. - Andrade can call him. - I've got no credit. - Bloody hell! - What? - You can't live like that. It ran out when I called recovery. I'm waiting for them to call me. "It ran out..." My patience is running out. I can't do any more, Paco. You can do what you want. Your breath smells. - I had two coffees. - Well, keep quiet until we get there. - No phone and no credit. - Why does it matter who calls? You guys don't give a damn because it's my money. - Are you scared of Emilio? - Don't talk crap. You tiptoe around him for sure. Emilio! What's up? Of course not. We've got a problem. I'm calling to see if we can sort it. We don't have a car. Andrade... Didn't get it serviced or whatever, because he's so thickheaded, and he's blown a head gasket. Yeah, all that's... Exactly! That's what I said to these guys. Problem is, there's no time for me to get a car now. But as we've got this far, I'm thinking: although it's not ideal, what about if we use your brother's car? No, but I gave you my word. I swear on my family, my kids, my life, we'll take your brother's car, he won't even know. I promise. I'm begging you. It's the only way. Thanks. Thanks a lot! - What did he say? - He'll talk to the others and call back. Perhaps he'll find a solution? For fuck's...! Can you stop making that noise? You sound like a cow chewing the cud. What are you doing? - Rolling a joint. - Are you mad? Why? What's up? If you even think about sparking that up in here, I'll kill you. - Yeah, Laura would have a right fit. - It's nothing to do with Laura. It's not the time, the day or the place to be smoking a joint. Paco, chill out, be kind to me. It's not my day today. It's not my day. - The plant! The plant. Why did you put it there? If you want, I'll put it in my neighbour's house. I woke up today, I swear, I woke up today and said: "I'm going to make an effort. For Paco, because he's always waiting for me". I got up, and as usual, I went down to the café for breakfast. I sat at the back, ordered a coffee, sparkling water. And I thought: "I'll order a tuna sandwich. For strength, you know, for protein, for...". I thought: "Paco said today's the day. I have to be on form". And Santi, the northerner, said to me: "That woman over there paid". I know what Santi's like, so I said: "You can't pay my bill again, I might be unemployed, but I can get by". And he said to me: "Nah, it's true, that woman paid, and she told me that she owes you this and more. And if it were up to her, she'd buy you breakfast every day". Everyone's off their head around here, it's like a nuthouse. So, I went up to the woman and I said: "Excuse me, lady"... But this was at like 8 in the morning, 08:05 at the latest. And I said: "Excuse me, we don't know each other. You've confused me with someone else". But you know what, when I saw her up close... I looked at her and... And... An older woman, but fuckable, you know? And I thought: "That face? That face...?". And the woman says: "Sit down, please." Confused as hell, I sit down, and she says to me, and I swear to God, she said to me... She said: "We need to talk". Talk about...? The recovery guys, Paco. Take it! Hello? Yes, that's me. Yes, I got cut off before. Hang on. It's... What number is this? Three. - Yes, it's Marqués de Corbera Street... - No! San Maximiliano, number three. - Yes, 3 San Maximiliano Street. - Where is it parked? - I'll wait. - The van. Where did you park it? In front of the discount shop. Tell me you didn't. Look at that. Prime spot. And to think I feel guilty because I'm always giving that dimwit Andrade a hard time. I'm lost for words. Perhaps there's time to move it before the pigs get here. How can he move it? The head gasket's screwed. Yes. San Maximiliano Street. - Three! - Three, number three. Yes. How long will they be roughly? Half an hour? No, if... No. Just if they could... It's parked in a bad spot. Yes. Yes, whatever they can... I understand. Thanks very much. Thanks. And the older woman? I can't remember where I was up to. Yes. The older woman... - The ash! - Yes, the older woman. So... - There. Forgive me, Paco. I'm not myself. So, the woman told me to sit down, that we had to talk. I asked what about, we don't even know each other. And she said we do know each other, we've known each other for a long time. I said: "Sorry, I don't follow". And she said to me, all dramatically, that she didn't know where to begin, that it was hard for her, that it was this and that, and something else... Then she blurts it out, suddenly, just like that... What? "I'm your mother." You're kidding? "Enrique, I'm your mother." As naturally as if she were ordering a drink. "I'm your mother." - And what did you say? - What could I say? It knocked me for six. I said: "Are you out of your mind? Because, let's see, my mother left when I was young. She left when I was nine years old". She looked at me and said: "Eight. And I'm sorry". I swear, I felt a chill go down my spine. I looked at her, and it just suddenly hit me. Holy...! After thirty years, my mother, in Bar Carrasco. What, are we mad? Is this just some kind of bad joke? That's how I recognised her. How could I not? Do you know the most ridiculous thing about it? I was thinking about it on my way over and I had to laugh... Whenever someone calls me Enrique, I say: "Don't call me that, not even my mother calls me Enrique". A tag line. - Yeah, a way of speaking. - But it turns out, who calls me Enrique? - Your mother. Fuck my life. So, what did you say? What do you want me to say? I don't know. I said: "Alright. Thanks for the coffee". And I got up... The bar was full and everyone caught on. It was like a TV programme. The ash, careful. The ash. Paco, I'm talking... Fucking hell! I'm talking about my mum and you care about ash? Fuck you, man! So she comes up behind me and says: "Enrique. Whatever you think of me, I'm worse. I've been coming here for a long time, seeing you having breakfast, and I've never had the courage, but today I decided to do it. I won't go into details, or explain why I did it now, but I have my reasons. I'm just asking you to keep hold of this". And she gives me this piece of paper with her number and says: "That's my number, in case you want to call me. When it's sunk in", she said. "It doesn't have to be tomorrow, but, please, think about it". And what did you say? Nothing, I left. You left, just like that? What should I do? It's like you don't even believe me. What do you want? Should I jump for joy, give her a hug, sing 'We are the world' or what? I don't know, man. Say something to her, at least. I won't lie. When I was little, I always imagined that... I don't know, I imagined I'd bump into her on the street. But not at forty. Call her. - Now? - Of course, pal. If not, when? Imagine what that poor woman is feeling now. Listen, Andrade, let me tell you something. You know my mother died a while back, right? Well, when she died, I realised that I actually had no idea who she was. If I could go back... If I could go back... Emilio. What's up, mate? Alright, alright! Great. That's great! Fucking awesome, that guy! Great, great. Yes, yes, yes. Of course. Three, San Maximiliano. Yes, yes, yes. Perfect. OK, OK. Awesome news, mate. Emilio has sorted it. At 10:15, alright? You tell him later. He's on the ball that guy, fuck me! He gets things done. Decisive. I want you on form, eh? - Yes. And Ramón? What are you up to? You shouldn't think about things, eh? Here. - There's no tone. - Of course not, they cut me off. Give him your mobile, Paco. - Are you paying? - Yes, I'll pay for it. - I've heard that before. - I'll pay, Paco. When your bill arrives, I'll pay whatever it costs, tight-arse. Don't be so stingy. - Stingy, tight-arse, coming from you? If you've got so much to say, where's your phone? And what about cars? You say people fly off the handle but you're like: "Can I have a lift?". And Emilio? What about Emilio? You've never had the balls to say anything to him. That's you. You want everyone else to pick up your slack. Ramón, I can't... I can't do it, Ramón. - What? - I can't do it. - What do you mean? Of course you can! - You don't understand. - What? - Everything. You don't understand. - I understand perfectly. You're the one who doesn't understand. - Ramón, respect the guy. Leave him be, he doesn't want to call. - Shut up! I know what I'm talking about. It's about his happiness. He still has time. Not me and you. We're done for. Or, at least, I am. It's about fixing a problem. I failed at fixing mine, so I know exactly what I'm talking about. Andrade, listen. Don't end up a mess like me. Don't marry, don't have kids. Go and see your mother... - He can't! - Everything else is just shit. - Don't keep on! - Shut your mouth, Paco! Ramón. Are you alright? I was going to ask the same. Are you OK? No, I'm not OK. He had a fight with Manoli. How are the kids? - He said they're a pain in the neck. - I never said that. You don't need to. We already know. - By the way, what about Susi? - What about her? - Is she still pressuring you for a baby? - Paco... Susi is just transitory. Even she knows that. - But did she say that or not? - Susi... Susi has an expiry date. And it's about being honest and open from the start. I don't answer to anyone. If I drop dead right now, I won't leave anyone in the lurch. Well, now you have your mother. Who's also pretty hot, he said. - Are you going to call her or not? - My mother? Of course. Do you think it's that easy? Do you know what I've been through? Do you know what my childhood was like? Can you imagine being the only one at school without a mother? Well, now you can start over. Yeah? Where should I start? When I was at kindergarten or at secondary school? Shall I get my reports out of the drawer and give them to her? The reports they gave me at school and I had no one to give them to. Eh? I would have loved it if they'd told me off for failing Maths or Social Studies. But I'd get home and my father, a complete waster, didn't give a shit. My grand mother, poor woman, had no idea. Where was my mother then? No, I get it. I don't know if I can forgive her, my mother. But she's my mother. That's why, when I saw her, I just froze. But it's also true that I'd have liked to have given her a hug. How am I supposed to want a family when I don't even know what one is? Come on, mate. You're like family to me. And that idiot too. I mean it. You mean the world to me. I'd die for you guys. Shit, Paco, that's really nice of you. I mean it. I love you like family. And all the times I've had a go at you, I meant it as a brother. - I know. - Because I want you to be better. And, although you drive me up the wall, I'll always be here. And the same to you. You're thorns in my side, but you're my thorns. You're family and I love you. So, come here. Let's have a hug. With my family. Not even God can touch you guys. Not even God! Alright, that's enough, eh? Come on now. That'll do. - I need to finish this. - Again? He needs help. If someone had done it for me, things would be different. We've already discussed it. He has to decide for himself. - Why? - Because it's personal, damn it! There's nothing personal in a family, we're a family, right? You just said we were. When one of us has a problem, it affects all of us. And, above all, we don't turn our backs on them, nor do we laugh at other people's problems. A family would never do that. Tell me that'll never happen. Ask him, at least. It should come from him, not because you're forcing him. Andrade, do you want me to call your mother? What? Honestly, gentlemen, please. Look what day it is, they're waiting for us. Let's go! - Should I call your mother, yes or no? - Yes, yes. - This is incredible, man! - It's turned off. - Shit battery. From the discount shop. When it drops to 40%, it turns off. - Where's the charger? For fuck's sake, Ramón. Over there. In the bedroom. Wait! Don't blow up the phone. It's the one with the narrow end. - What's the pin? - One, two, one, two. - What are you doing? - What do I say? Fuck me, that you're a friend. - Of who? - Mine! Yes, hello. Good morning. I'm one of Andrade's friends, Ramón. Well, we're almost like family. And Paco, who's here with us as well. Yes, listen, let's see... The person who really wants to talk to you is Enrique. But, it's just that... I think he might need a few days before he's up to it, he needs to get his head around it, you know? But the reason for my call today, is to let you know that what happened this morning hasn't fallen on deaf ears. You're probably a bit emotional, confused right now, but I'm sure, in a few days time, you'll look back at today and be happy. And I wanted to say that I'm here, to help you guys with anything you need. Because, well, I know a bit about psychology. One moment. Andrade, she's asking for your number. Tell her it's better if I call her. Hello? Yes, look... No, he said don't worry, he'll call you. Yes, yes. Don't worry. I'll make sure of it. Of course. Yes, he'll definitely call. Sorry? Alright, thank you very much. Bye for now. What did she say? May God bless us all. Shit, to the psychologist! Alright, gents, come on. Let's get back to the present. Back to what we're doing. Come on! Let's get cracking. Thank you, Ramón. - I don't think I'm going to go. - What? You need someone strong, psychologically. You know that, Ramón. I'll be a hindrance. It's better I go home. You can't give up now, Andrade. - I don't have the strength. - It's not about strength. It's about commitment. He doesn't have to come if he doesn't want to. Aren't we a family, Ramón? You said it yourself. Don't start that again. Let him do what he wants. "Let him do what he wants" Of course, that's it. That's it. He's forty years old but you treat him like he's twenty. - Can't you see how he's feeling, Paco? - Can't you see how I'm feeling, Ramón? I'm going to bust my balls if you keep putting flies in the ointment. I face my problems like an adult, do you understand? I don't go looking for pity. I stand on my own two feet. I lick my own dick, get it? I act like a man. You guys need to do the same. Act like men and get on with the plan. You? Self-sufficient? The last time we went out, you asked Laura for money for drinks. Are you only with her because she pays your way? What's this about her paying my way? Why are you bringing Laura into this? - Come on, I know you, Francisco Javier. You're always talking about how you'd fuck half the girls we pass in the street. - It's true. Yesterday you said that you'd have it off with Patty. - I said that? - Yes, that you'd have it off with her. Patty or her grandmother, if she'd let you. - Me? - You! What? And you guys don't? You told me that you're fed up of Manoli and dying to screw around a bit. And you too, you're sick of shagging Susi. When I get sick of her, it's over. I'm clear on that. Look at him, the plucky playboy. Face it, you won't leave her because you'd be out on a limb! You'll be out on a limb if you keep smoking that shit! At least I can get it up. What did you say, Andrade? What did you say? What? Nothing. - Did you hear that? - Yes, I heard, Paco. But let me tell you something. If you don't want to be judged, don't judge others. Where did you get that from? I want another beer. Shall I bring you one? I'm your friend. Where did you hear that I'm impotent? - I didn't say that. - Don't treat me like an fool. Where did you hear that? - You're not a fool. - Where did you hear it? - I made it up! - Like fuck you made it up! - Shit, it's just something you say! Something you...? Look at this guy, young bastard. - You're on edge. Tell me how you know... - I know nothing, Paco! You know nothing, like the philosopher. It's just a saying. - What are you on about? - I'm not an idiot, you bastard. - I'm leaving. No, don't even think about it. No, no, no. Tell me where you heard it... - What are you doing? That's ridiculous. Where did you hear it? It's very simple. Who told you? We shouldn't touch such personal subjects. - Laura told you. - No! - It was Laura. - What are you saying? Who was it then? Who the fuck was it? Who was it? - Laura told me. Alright? Give it a rest! How could she? What a cow! She's a fucking cow. That's what she is. - Chill out, Paco. Why are you wearing that? - Did you know we're the same size? - I don't give a shit. - It's not that bad. - It's not that bad? My wife explains to this clown... - Drop the insults, eh? - That I'm impotent, and that's OK? These things happen. Anyway, erectile dysfunction is... - Don't say dysfunction, damn it! - Why? - When did you start talking to Laura? Just when we bump into each other on the street. Do you think I'm an idiot? You bump into her and then: "Hey, how's things? By the way, my husband is impotent". Do you think I'm an idiot? - What are you trying to say? - You know exactly what I'm saying. - No, I don't. What do you mean? - Or should I ask her? Ask her what? What? How long you've been fucking. - Me and Laura? - Yes, of course. - Me and Laura? - If not, how do you know I'm impotent? - You've lost your... - How do you know? - Are you mad? - How do you know? - Paco, the recovery truck! - Recovery or no recovery! Even if it's the King of Spain. - Paco. I knew something was going on, but I never thought it was you. Paco, take a minute. I think you're jumping to conclusions. - Now it makes sense. She always talks so highly of Andrade. That I should be nice to him... - Paco, the recovery truck! That he's alone... Yes? They hung up. Son of a bitch! - Stop right there, that's offensive. - I'm sure there's a simple explanation. The explanation is that you're supposed to be my best friend and you've stabbed me in the back. - Is that what you think? - Yes. You think I'd do that to you? You know I love you and I respect you, I could never do a thing like that. I'm going to call Laura. Paco! I'm going to call Laura. What are you doing? Don't be stupid. He doesn't want me to call. That says a lot. - It doesn't say anything. - You don't understand. Laura's doing the dirty on me. - How do you know? - I know. - It doesn't mean she's doing it with me. Perhaps she's not doing it with anyone. She's been at it since last Christmas, at least. You have proof, right? A fucking text message. You looked through her text messages? Two weeks. It was two weeks of hell, man She went out every day, came home really late, with strange excuses. Someone else, man. Suddenly, I saw myself living with someone else. And it was making me smaller and smaller, like... Like I was just a piece furniture. And... And I thought: "It can't be, not Laura. There's something else. Something's wrong. Put yourself in her shoes". And... But it kept coming back to me, again and again... And one day she was taking a nap and I thought: "I need to know". I swear, Ramón, I would have loved to find nothing. But there it was. A clear message from an unknown sender: "Leave Paco, I'll make you happy". Shit, man... That doesn't prove anything. It could be some nuisance who wants to score with her and she's keeping a wide berth. There were more messages. Even more humiliating. Apparently I haven't got what "Your crazy E" has got. It's pretty obvious, right, Ramón? - No, it's not obvious. - Of course it is. "E" from Enrique. - What are you saying? - Yes. "E" from Enrique. Nobody calls me that, even my lovers call me Andrade. - What about your mother? - She just appeared after thirty years! - She calls him Quique. - Leave my mother out of this! - "Your crazy E". Fuck me! - I swear it's nothing to do with me. How the hell do you know about my impotence then? I can't tell you. Bloody hell, Paco! Paco, no, man! Paco, fuck! Paco! Let him go, Paco, you're strangling him! There's nothing between me and Laura, Paco. I know about your impotence through Emilio. Emilio? Yes, Emilio. How the hell does he know? "Your crazy E." He's one hell of a son of a bitch. When did he tell you? What does it matter? When did he tell you, Andrade, please? - What does it change? - Everything, damn it! When? At the last committee meeting. With the lawyers. In November. When you guys left, we went out for food and we got absolutely wrecked. And with all the craziness, Emilio told me. And my impotence? He told you that too? I'm sorry. Why didn't you say before, you bastard? I know how highly you think of him. He's untouchable. I swear I told him to tell you, that he was really screwing you over. That's why me and Emilio is a no. I feel uncomfortable. Even today was uncomfortable for me. What did you want me to do? - Tell me! - It's not that easy. Yes, Paco. It's not that easy, man. It's easier to be a coward. It's harder to be a man. That's what's hard. - I didn't want you to suffer. - That bloke is no better than me. I want everyone to know. He's not better than me! Laura can pick that up! Please, don't tell him. Don't tell him I told you. - Who else knows? - I don't know. I swear on my mother, I'll show that bastard who I am. I'm going to kill him. I'm going to kill him! I'll kill that bastard! God damn it! - I don't think that's wise. - No? What should I do then? - Talk to him. - Yes, Paco. Talking is the best thing. - Talk to him? A chat? I'll have a chat with him. I'll tell him we're not going anywhere. I'll talk to him and I'll call Laura as well. I'll call him and Laura, talk to them both. Wait until Laura comes home, talk about it calmly. Yes, Paco. Talk to Laura here. Look. Look. - Don't tell him I told you. What do I do? Emilio, what's up? - Paco, what's up? I'm here. Coming down or shall I come up? Hello? Paco? Should he park or are we going down? Can you hear me? I think it's cut off. Paco? - Emilio, we'll come down. OK? We'll come down. No, no, I'm calm. I'm not getting wound up. Park up on the corner, we need to have words. Yes, we're going to talk about Laura, I found out. You're denying it, you bastard? You're going to deny it? And screwing my wife isn't insulting me? Right in front of my nose, bastard? Andrade told me. - Paco! Fuck you, you bastard! I'm going to ruin your life. Wait there. Where are you? Where are you, damn it? Here? Where? I'm going to go to your house. I'm going to tell your wife, straight to her fucking face. She already knows? I'll set fire to your car or your house, or whatever. Where are you? Coward! Son of a bitch! You can shove your plan up your ass! We're not going to go! Not Andrade, nor Ramón, nor me. Get it, you bastard? Because you're a coward and a faggot! Why did you hang up, son of a bitch? Where are you? Face the consequences! Don't run off like you did the day of the march, faggot, when the police turned up! Or when you had to take your gun out in Atocha, you didn't have the balls! Because you're a coward! Come out and face up to it! Face up to it! Andrade... I'm sorry. I don't care about my car. I'm more bothered about Emilio. I told you not to tell him. - Forgive me. It was there inside me and I couldn't hold it in. How much will it cost to get it out of the pound? A hundred and forty something. Plus the fine, but we'll split that. If you don't mind, I'm going to roll a joint. Good idea. Smoke it here on the street. Because of Laura? Laura got in a huff about me spending money on a frame. "These things are forever", I said. Don't get me started on the seeds. "Careful, Paco, you don't notice, but some end up on the floor, it's really difficult to clean them up." Take a drag, Paco. Laura can find herself a little flat to live in. With her friend Emilio or her friend Lola. Or on the fucking street. It won't affect my conscience if I see her under a bridge. But isn't this her parent's flat? What? Yes, it's her parent's. You can stay at mine whenever you want. Thanks, Andrade. Don't you want any more? No. I don't want any more. Just until I find something, OK? Sure man, as long as you don't bollock me about the smoke, you can stay for... I hardly use the lounge. It's true. You've got a sofa bed in there. - Of course. - Yes. Ramón, my car isn't in the garage. I sold it for some cash, because... Laura's always having to bail me out. For a bit more autonomy. Why don't we call the others and say we'll go without Emilio? - There's no time now. - Of course there's time. If not, we'll start over, it doesn't matter. Everyone does what Emilio says. Until they don't, like you, Paco. Let's convince the others, fuck Emilio off and you can take the reins. We should have done it a long time ago. Ramón, they're already there. They'll have started without us. There's no time. Paco's right. We're cowards. We always have been, eh? Since we started the strike. Long before they started laying people off. Always doing whatever Emilio says. He's not always right, you know that all too well. It's easy to say that now. Know what I thought when I saw you shouting out on the street this morning? I thought something was changing. We need to do something, starting from now. Right now, I'm not... I'm not up to anything right now, Ramón. Well I am. What do you want to do? Something, man. Something that isn't just sitting here, doing nothing. Something that isn't what others want us to do. Like what? Leave Madrid. Where do you want to go? With what money? Any money. If I have to, I'll take Manoli and her savings and I'll go. If not... We could do a jewellery shop. A robbery... "The three robbers". That's Laura. - How do you know it's Laura? - That's her ring tone. What are you going to do? - I don't know. - You have to do something, Paco. - I guess so. - Answer it and talk to her. - Now? - No, better not. - Why not? - I don't know. - She hung up. - Oh well. She's calling again. Answer it. Go to the bedroom and talk it over calmly. But listen: deep breath and stay calm. Deep breath and stay calm. Go on! Laura. - This is going to heat up. - Yes. Where the hell...? Listen... Paco's not shouting. What? I can't hear an argument or anything. - Nothing? - I can't hear Paco shouting. You're... Ah, Paco. Of course, man. It's true. It's all very quiet. What? What are you referring to? The street. I can't hear anything. What do you want to hear? Cars, people...? What? The noise. I don't follow, Ramón. What do you mean? The noise of the world, Andrade. I don't know what I want to say. I just think it and it comes out. But what are you thinking? I'm not thinking about anything. Or maybe I am. I'm thinking about your mum. My mother? Don't waste the opportunity to get to know her, pal. When mine died, man, I realised that I actually didn't know her at all. Yeah, you told me. I'm sorry. It's important. What's up with you? I'm nervous. Why? I don't know. You don't know? I don't know, man. Because of things that happen in life. Which make sense, apparently, but then, later, when... What's Paco doing? I can't hear him shouting. Are you alright, Ramón? Yes, I'm alright. You're a bit... How many beers did you have? Perhaps it's that. I feel a bit sick. I think I'll go down to the street. - Do you want me to come with you? - No. I just need a bit of air. I prefer to go alone. As you wish. A Municipal Transport Company bus on a bridge over the M-30 motorway. Traffic has been stopped on the city's primary ring road since 07:35... Weren't you going out? Vehicle is hanging over the motorway at... What are you turning it off? For a while now, I've been looking for answers. I want to know if I've programmed since childhood or if I decide what I do. You decide what you do, obviously. - No it's not obvious. - Ah, no? No. There's a huge difference. If my brain has been genetically programmed, then I wouldn't be responsible... for robbing a jewellery shop. - Not again with the jewellery shop. Whereas, if I'm in charge of my actions at all times, then I would be responsible for whatever I did. What are you telling me, Ramón? Do you know what the limbic system is? The limbic system Not a clue. The limbic system is responsible for our emotions. An amygdala controls all those things. Ah. Ah? What? What do you want me to say? Something. Something more interesting than "ah". I've no clue what to say. For example, that it would be shit luck if something wasn't working in my head. Ramón, are you OK? What do you mean shit luck? Why do you say that? Of course it would be shit luck, like if mine didn't work. That would be shit luck. What's up with you? Ramón, what's wrong? Ramón. Are you alright? A lack of connection between the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex of the brain, that could be because of a childhood accident, you know? Or some kind of abuse. Or, even, a genetic malformation. Well, that disconnection results in a lack of emotion. They don't empathise with others. What's this about, Ramón? Why are you telling me this now? I'm telling you, Andrade, because you're my best friend. You and that idiot Paco, you're my best friends. You're my best friend too, Ramón. Look, that shows we do have feelings. That you're a sensitive guy, because you know what friendship is. Well, I had a complete lack of feelings today, Andrade. - Today when? Now? - This morning. A complete lack of feelings. My limbic system went to shit. But, why? I think you're a very sensitive person. What happened? I don't know. The thing is, right now, I don't feel anything. Nothing of what? The hate. I don't feel the hate, Andrade. How did it go with Laura? - Fine. - Fine? What's up with you two? What's up? Ramón. Was that Laura or not? Paco! Ramón. What's up with you, Paco? Look, I'm off. I'm telling you that I'm going! What's up, Paco? Yes, I talked to Laura. Ramón. What happened? You need to know something. What? This morning, on my way over here, I convinced myself that nothing had happened. And I managed it. It's incredible how the brain works. I don't know what's wrong. He's been like that since you left. No, nothing happened. It's all just a nightmare. Laura told me to put the TV on. Why? What's up with the TV? The police are coming to take you in. The police? What's happening with the police? What happened? Like the slot machine in the Carrasco. Game over. Ramón, look at me. It's me, Paco. Tell me what happened, go on. Honestly, I don't know. I got up this morning and I told Manoli the plan. She didn't say anything. She looked at me in silence, like she does these days. You know, like I'm a brute, an animal. That really annoyed me, Paco. "Ah, well I hope it goes well", but in that dry, empty tone. Like she's a victim. I said to her: "If you don't love me anymore, say it to my face. If you don't want to be with a loser, say it to my fucking face. What's wrong? Are you ashamed of your husband?". She got all nervous, dodged me, and locked herself in the bathroom. I banged on the door, after a while, she came out, grabbed the kids, who were eating in the kitchen, and locked herself in the bedroom with them, like a mad woman, like she was protecting them. But from who? From me? I've been a security guard since 1998. I protect them. I protect people. "What do you think? That the father of your children is a monster?". Then, I went to the lounge, grabbed my fishing machete, I locked the door to the flat with two turns, I broke the bedroom door open... I don't know what happened next. It was all so quick. On my way over here, I told myself: "No, that was just a nightmare. Later, when I go back home, Manoli will be there, as irritating as ever". And the children? What about the children? The children as well? I can't believe it. They're the only good thing I've done in my life. Failure. Failure of the limbic system. What are you going to do, Ramón? Get the guys to sign it, except Emilio. Even though we won't win the final. It doesn't matter. Police, open the door! Police, open the door! Make sure they bury me in uniform, Paco. Promise me. We're coming in! Relax, Ramón. Relax, it's over now. It's over now, relax. Do it for us, please, Ramón. It's over. It's over. Who am I kidding? I don't have the balls.
