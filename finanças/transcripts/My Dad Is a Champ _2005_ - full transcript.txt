MY FATHER IS A BOXER Parents are invited to the competition on Saturday. Let's see. Can you box with it? It's nothing. "It's nothing." We haven't seen much of your father. Will he come on Saturday? Yes, he'll come. Stefan, come on. Get out! Mom! Excuse me, excuse me... Honestly! Excuse me. I'm waiting in the car. I invited grandparents tomorrow at three o'clock. I took time off. You can come home early from school. We can make a cake together, if you like. Shall I come to the competition on Saturday? Will they let anyone come? Parents aren't invited. Is that something new? It just is. Stefan! Breakfast. You coming? Congratulations, honey. Blow out the candles. Do it harder. What would you like? I don't know. Is anything wrong? Is that all? Uh-huh. Want another? Don't I always get something from my father? Yes, but not today. Why? I don't know. Lost in the mail, maybe. I can open it. How can mail get lost? I do not know. Come on. Do you like it? But he always sent me something. No parcel. I don't know why. But you must know why. No, I don't know. Stop, okay? Can't we call him? No, I do not know his phone number. You know that he travels all the time. And I won't talk to him. But I do. That enough! We're sitting here enjoying ourselves... and we don't need anyone else! I did all this for you and... you don't even care abou it. I'm really trying to do something... Stefan, come back. Some out, Stefan. Go away! Listen... Can I come in? Stefan... Your present's probably just held up at the post office. Sure. Come on, darling. I know it's hopeless. Okay? We hear from him maybe twice in a year. And I can't remember the last time we saw him. Can you? We must go, or we'll be late. Come on. Take a couple of muffins. After ten years, I've had my fill of muffins. What's wrong with them? I just don't want to take them to school. I want them! Wait, let's save them for tonight. Just one? Take one, all right. - Won't you have one? - No, thanks. Aww, come here. - Take care! - Goodbye! You go without me. What for? You can find school alone. Where are you going? Just do as I say. You can't tell me what to do. I can. Cause I'm the older brother. I'll tell mom unless you tell me. Mom! Okay. I'm going to see father. Yes, and you'll just slow me down. I'm coming. No, you go to school. Mom! Okay, but you do what I say. Yes, yes. So come. Our father is a professional boxer. He is in Demark now. I think he's a trainer at a major camp. We'll have to show him that we're not weaklings. Dad is not used to wimps... so we must be tough. These boxers do not say: "Hello". They say: "Fizkult-hello". Why do they say that? They just do. And does father have a tattoo? Of course. Really? Yes, don't you see? All the boxers have tattoos. He left because he does not like us? No, why? Otherwise he wouldn't have left. I suppose he thinks we're boring. Fizkult-hello! Just a moment, I'm coming. Yes? We'd like to see our father. What's his name? Michael Steensgaard. He lives here? Yes. He's a boxer. A boxer? Boxer? No boxers live here. He smashed his head to a Chinese man in the ring. Oh, did he? And he has tattoos all over his body. Okay... You know him? Michael. Michael, you say? This is him. This Michael works as a cook. No, he was a boxer. I know that Michael. He is a cook. But he was world champion in boxing. That may be, but he is a cook. He's off today. But... I can give you his address. Here... a farm on Route 40, way out there. You can find out for yourself. My father can't be a cook. And a cook doesn't live in the hotel? No, he works there. He can't live here. Why not? Dad would never live in a shack. Come on. Where are you going? Where are you, Tobias? Do you know where the door is? I don't know. There it is. Fizkult-hello! Fizkult-hello! No one's home. Can I see too? - No one's here. - Why? This is not the house. What the hell are you doing here? What have these boys done to the garden? It's not our father. Can we ask his name? No. He's just some fool. Tobias! Stefan, is that you? What the hell... How did you get here? How did you know where I live? Completely unbelievable. You can't just come here. Does your mother know you're here? She's probably looking for you. That's for not giving Stefan any present! Come! Hey, Stefan. Wait a minute. I had completely forgotten. This is for your birthday. Buy yourself something. Okay? Don't be stupid. I don't need money. You must excuse me. I'll buy you a gift. I don't want gifts from you! What are you doing, Stefan? You're a idiot. Not a real boxer, even. Okay. I'm not, but so what? Come on, Stefan. Come on. Come on. Harder. Come on. See Stefan. He was a boxer! Ow. Damn! What are you doing? Thank you for the juice. How long you been boxing, Stefan? Not very... almost a year. You're pretty good, I think. I train twice a week. And every weekend. When I was a boy, after events, I had a headache for 14 days sometimes. I don't think it's so bad. But you're tough. I would like to see you fight. Why haven't you called? Mom was furious. Yes, I know. But I forgot the time. I did not know if you wanted to see me. You could have just asked. Yes, I could have just asked. I have boxed many times, but mostly I worked as a cook. And you know what? I have sailed around the world. On this ship? Yes. Most recently. Sailed around the world a couple of times... on the "Nina". I made this model. Would you like it, Stefan? I can have it? Of course you can. You haven't had your birthday present. Hi. Fizkult-Hello, Mom. Where have you been? They just came by, so... But they did the right thing. Tobias! Damn. You're a menace. Are you coming in? No, I have to go on. But thanks for the offer. Don't promise more than you can keep. Did you have fun? Stefan, I... You have a match this weekend. Remember what I said... Protect you're head from the punch. And I can come? Can I? Maybe. I'll just check if parents can come. I'm really... glad that you came. I've enjoyed it very much. And I want to see you again. Fine.
