Oh John. It's so good to see you too. You have no idea what I've been through . I just wish he was still here to help me. It's difficult and painful to lose a loved one. So. What specifically do you want to talk about? Huh, I really don't know where to begin. - Start at the beginning. - Things that feel real don't happen I see people killed and then they vanish. Everywhere I go people stop and stare at me. They follow me. They're trying to get a roll of film from me. You see people killed? Yes. Pamela, get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath and let's start again. OK, my boss sent me an assignment To work on the election. Election, what election? OK, I saw this guy running through the cemetery. These 3 women were chasing him, and I followed taking pictures. They chased him into the cemetery where they met up with another group of guys, and they're standing there . They did some sort of sacrifice, or something then they killed him. I watched them kill him, they cut him from his gut to his throat. Then they spotted me, John. And I ran. Did you call the police? I called 911, and they were in on it. The police [whispered] They're all in on it. Wow. I watched them kill him they cut him from his gut to his throat. Election, [laughs] what election?

I guess you want this too. What's that? Oh yeah. What's on there, her boyfriend, her x-boyfrie nd or something like that? Yeah. Something like that. You are doing nothing about this situation but poking around and asking questions . With no real facts. OK Mrs. Garret, we know how you feel . We can assure you that things will be set up. But, what we need to know is how you entered our lives. What happened to you in the last forty-three hours? There is something very wrong with that place. We need to do something now. What place? Talk to us? Fuck, damn you. All of you . You're just not listening to a fucking word I say. Damn it, I've been telling you over and over again, but you're not listening to me.

Shower, get dressed, do my hair, and then I leave . If you say around at 8:15 everyday, then just be there at 8:15. Yeah, and when I'm there at 8:15, then you're here at 6:45 frustrated with m e. What time you wake up anyway? And what the hell are you doing looking in that bag? We're late, let's go. Tampons, I think I'm getting my perio d. That's a little more information than I really needed to know right now, all right? You know what? Never mind . They are where you think they're not. They stay when they shouldn't. They're all around us in the depths of the shadows. They will come for you. Hide ! I kid you not. No, no, no, no, no. They are more than just a seeker of your souls . Ever seen a homeless Jehovah Witness before ? ...to carry out his request. Evil has risen up from HEL L! Ah no. Ah no. Right now from the chambers of hell to the protectors on Earth , They will not stop until they confronted us all . He's going straight to hell. Stone trees?

You will be hunted. Now that's it. That's it. Good bye. We're out of here. The lord of hell awaits for the war monger laughs. [maniacal laughing] I have swam the lake of flames and I have walked forbidden tracks. I have lived in the valley of the shadow of death and I have feared no evi l. [background conversation] Then let's rewrite it. and we write a quote. No, we write the lead-in. Write the lead-in to the quote . Tell Cameron and Ann they're full of shit. I need that story on my desk by 10:00 AM tomorrow. Thank you. [phone slams] Hey Nootch, looks like we have a front page problem. I remember when this business had some integrity. Now, with the fucking Internet? We're forced to cater to all these God dammed knuckle draggers. You're preaching to the choir, man. Where did you get such a lovely, lovely sweater? You gave it to me for Christmas. I have impeccable taste. Oh Pam, how you doing, Pamster? Oh, you are not so cool, Rooster. Good morning Cameron, how's Gladys and the kids doing? The old lady's as mean as a damn snake. Little Billy's gonna be starting high school soon, and little Amanda just said her first word "Shit". Of all the God damn words to pick up , she's gotta go with shit . I blame my wife for that . They say the third time's the charm, I'd like to meet the son of a bitch who came up with that one and then just kick him in the God damn nuts . Jesus Christ. If I go on like this, my shrinks not gonna earn her $235.00 an hour. Better save it. You all right? Good. Got any boyfriends yet? No. You all squared away with the bills and everythin g? 'Cause, you know, I'm always here for you. I'm hanging tough. How are you doing, Cameron? So, Gladys is really getting to you, huh? I'm sure it'll pass. Now, let's get to work here. First of all, I want to apologize for your last 2 assignment s. I know they were pretty damn brutal . I'll make it up to you when you take your vacation. What do you got coming up this year, a week? Actually, its 3 weeks this time around. Hmm. Forget that. Take a month. The extra week is on me. Young lady, you have shot some of the best pictures we've seen here at the Trib. And you still do it the old fashioned way, with fil m. Yeah, go ahead. Take the month . And while you're at it, go buy yourself a fucking digital camera. Please . Jesus Christ. Now that's a God damn sham e. Its bad enough they go into full deta il with their, so-called, graphic style of journalis m. But Christ Almighty, God up above. Do they have to put it on the front fucking page? Did you see this? Yeah. Its been all over the television . More corruption in the big blue, they're calling it. They say his best friend and ex-partner took him out. New York city, such a beautiful place. Filled with so much excitement. Horrible tragedy of 9/11. Hero pilot landing his plane on the Hudson fucking river. Damn, if I would have gotten a tip, I would have sent you to do a front page story . Oh, bless her heart. She's so cute. I feel like I'm a little boy when I'm around her. I can't even begin to start telling you how happy you've made me since I've met you . You know tha t? I love you so much. So, now wait a minute. Pam, is your father expecting Zack or Father Garret? [they laug h] No, he keeps teasing me about tha t. You know, seeing I was a lazy grown up going to church so I brought it right to m e. My mother and grandmother, on the other hand, they think I'm creating this outrageous sin. My grandmother especially, she's very superstitious. She told me that a lady at bingo told her, that when a priest loses his faith, and leaves the priesthood that he's opening the gates of hell. That's such nonsense. I know. You want to take a ride? No. I'd rather just hang out and talk. OK. Pamela Garrett. I like the sound of that, do you? Very much. Pam, I did something the other day without telling you. What did you do now, Mr.? I'm gonna break those little habits of yours. Well, I took a ride up to the country with Cameron, to the Catskill mountains. to see his very adorable 3 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath, the one he's always been talking about . Hm, so that's where you went the other night. The night you didn't come home until real late? Yeah OK, go on with your story. Well, the story goes like this. Private pool, the greenest grass you've ever laid your eyes on, and a sand lot built into the back. A red swing set, already put up for kids to have hours of enjoyment . And to save the best for last, a private lake with a speed boat tied to the dock. Pam, Cameron made an offer to me, that I couldn't say no. What? Its yours. Oh my God. I thought you didn't want to take that long commute to the city, what made you change your min d? Well... My gosh, I'm gonna cry . Our Albany office made an offer to me, Senior Editor's job. I took it. And they were looking for a top-notch photographer, so you know what ? You footed the bill. That's only if you want it, Sweetie . 'Cause if you don't,it's OK. We can find a house somewhere in Jersey, or in Queens, It doesn't make a difference, 'cause to me, Pam, my home is with you. Yes, Albany it is. [kissing sounds] You are a true angel, Zachary Garrett. More like a fallen angel. Aw crap. Forget that. I've decided to put you on something else. Something not quite so violent. Not like that Washington assignment, where you were dead-center of a riot, when all the banks shut down. No one covered that, but us. And those pictures were amazing. Pure art. Yeah. I was almost killed, Cameron. Art in your eyes? Glass shattered in mine. Wow, that's deep. Real deep, Pamela. Yeah, well anyway, this assignment is local. I want you to take pictures for Dylan's spread on the rise and fall of politicians. Like when you took that picture of the Mayor smoking crack. And, since we're heading into election season, I'd like to get a jump start on it. I already have Dylan looking into that intern, from that other scanda l. What the hell was her name? God damn it, what the fuck was that girl's name? I can't remember. Hm, sure she gets that a lot . Probably a day late after the whole deed is done. [laughs] That's funny. I like tha t. Thank you Sophia, my darling. Aw shit, I've got a meeting with the boss. OK, Pam baby. I will catch you on the rebound. Go out and capture \ some great pictures. Sophia, thank you my darling. She's the best. Pamela Garrett speaking. Yeah, somebody just paged me. OK, I'll hold. Hey Dylan, what's up? Nothing, he gave me a month. I told you. Yeah, yeah, we had to cover that editorial anyway, that you're doing so, OK, why don't you go ahead and meet me at Suggesta? All right. Cool. So, about 10, 15 minutes ? All right, I'll see you then. Bye. I don't know, the way I look at it, it's a no-win situation for any of those people. Really ? Aw fuc k. Coffee smells like dirty ass. Sweetheart. Get another cup of coffee? All right. Dirty ass? That is so vulga r. Ugh, how do you know what dirty ass smells like anyway? There was this one time You know what, I really don't want to know about i t. How's that coffee? Hey beautiful, I love the way you pour a cup of coffee . Lovely. Yeah, on a business job? I understand that, Dylan. But, if they had the ability to transfer anyone , any time, anywhere? Then I say get a union in ther e. that'll cut that BS. Naw, they're scared to get a union in there. The people, they're foreigners that work ther e. They don't care about minimum wage, they don't care about the stress of the factor y. I'm telling you one thing right no w, that place is going down. The managers suck. All right, it's like too many chiefs, not enough Indians. They even told me, when the lease is up , They're moving the place to Lincolnton, North Carolin a. Those bastards. They can't do that. Can you not do that, please? Please don't do that now. Come o n. You are so uptight. What is it? That celebicy thing is fucking with you, huh? Hey, tell me the truth , when is the last time you got laid? [he laughs] I could help you with that celibacy problem. In some other life, maybe. Not even. You remember Mickey? And Linda? Yeah. And that kid across the street that they practically raised ? Yeah. Linda's been fucking this ki d, and this poor bastard, Mickey, didn't find out until he stepped out of their bed, in their bedroom, on a used condom. Lovely. Lovely for the kid, I tell you that. She was covering everything, the hotel, his college . It's amazing for him. You believe that shit? Where are the morals these days? I don't know, maybe I need to find a freak like Linda. You know? [laugh s] Pam, you know what? You're perfect for me. Wait a minute, how did you get me compared to Linda out of this? Come on now. Besides, we tried that already. Yeah, that was in high school, you know? I mean I've matured now, you know? I've got money . You wouldn't have to take care of us . It has nothing to do with money. I couldn't give a sh it if you were a janitor or a journalist . OK? I'm not materialisti c. I would be happy living in a shack behind a railroad track, tired, hungry, and broke, As long as I got love, that's all that matters to me, O K? That's it. I just want to be happy. Money means nothing to me. I'm not the person you love and you're telling me you want to live by a shack in a railroad.. . Like you're a reverse Cinderella. I don't know. I don't get you. I really don't. You know what, why don't you be a sweetheart and pick up the check. I'll see you later. You know what, that's perfect. Leave me with the bill, deny my love. You know what? My mother was right about you anyway, you know? She used to, "Dylan, what do you see in that girl?" I'm like, "I don't know, Ma, she's got a banging body, rich, intelligent, beautiful ". I don't know, why would I want to. .. You never seen anybody talk to themselves before? Aw Jeez. [sighs] [rock music] * Turning my back * on the world today * Sometimes I just * need to get away. * Always some worried faces* * from what I need to do. * * Away * from missing you. * Because I knew that I * on my own * same old song * on my own way. * * Dying to break * this wall of pain. * But I keep on losing * all I strain. * Speak to me. What else is it that's making you feel the way you do? John, I lost my faith. Every time I hear these confessions which are way out of my league, I can't help these people, John. When they ask me to cure their mother's cancer, or their grandfather's eyesight, I don't think me telling them to say 4 "Our Fathers" is going to cleanse things, John . I understand. You just lost your father. Questions are building up, you want answers. Trust me,the Lord will guide you through these tumultuous times. Its just not that. I met a woman. So? You're supposed to meet people the community when you come to a new place. It's natural. I'm not sure if I understand what you're trying to tell me, Zack. I'm a bit lost here. Zack. We're old friends. Old friends. We've know each other since we served as alter boys together at St. Vincents? I wasn't happy so I transferred here. And then you joined me. And I really thought... I have these feelings when I'm around her. Nervous feelings? It's different. You took an oath before the Lord. Feelings are nothing. They should not, and they will not come between you and the church. You're not going to see her anymore. You're not going to see her anymore. In time, you'll feel natural again, like you used to. As far as I'm concerned, this conversation never took place. I think I love her, John. Love's natural. It's all right to love and feel being loved within thee. Community of the Church. Its not natural for a priest to to be aroused, John. I think I was aiming to please my parents by becoming a priest. My mother felt, to get closer to God, I must serve Him. And I think you should continue to Serve. I need to serve my feelings, John. I want a change of lifestyle, John. I want to explore. I want to feel life as a parent. Yes John, I want to have kids . I want to see them grow old, and make me a grandfather. Don't you see what I'm saying, John? You're my close friend and that's why I'm telling you about my situation. I want to be happy, And when I'm near her I'm happiest, John. OK. I understand. I'm a little hurt. But you are right about me being your close friend and I I want you to be happy, yes, as any friend would do. Very well. I'll get an approval for your discharge. I hope you find your happiness. Good luck. You are a true angel, Zachary Garrett. More like a fallen angel. Wish you'd stop with that guilt. You are no fallen angel, and you know it. Pam, please. You know how I feel about this discretion, OK? Look, I fell from grace, and disgraced myself, and disgraced my father. Even though he's past, I feel him looking down on me in a very hurtful way. Even John Cole . You heard what he said. I left such a hole in my soul. I've known him for a long time, so don't let him fool you. * I feel them by me You listen to me, and I mean really listen to me this time . You did what you had to do, OK? OK? Father Cole will get over it . As far as your father goes, he's proud of you. I mean very proud of you. God is a very forgiving God. You know that better than anybody. So, meeting me and marrying me, doesn't make you burn in hell. Everything happens for a reason. Love Besides... We waited to make love until afterwards. Will my thought hurt me? Wow, what a speech. So, where did all this religion pour out? I thought you said you were an atheist? I don't know where it came from . I am an atheist who happens to be in love with an angel. [suspenseful music] [gunshot] [camera clicking] Who you running from, big boy? [inaudible] [scary laughter] [inaudible] [screaming] [screaming] [stabbing sounds] [chewing sounds] Damn it. Damn. Well,[inaudible]. [crazy laughter] Shit. You will be killed. Think, call the police or someone. [sniffing] Hello, 911 emergency, how can I help ? Yes, operator I need to report a murder. They just... Did you say a murder, ma'am? Yes, at the Crismont cemetery. Please I need your help. There was a man just butchered and I don't know Where in the Crismon t cemetery did this occur? The east sid e. by the railroad tracks, I don't know, by the slanted tree. Please, can you get somebody over here to help me or not? I need help. Did they see you take the pictures of them? No, no, I never said anything about taking picture s. Yes, you did. You said you were taking pictures of an auto accident . over in Crismont cemetery . And you spotted men knocking over head stones. That is what you said, Miss Garrett . No, no, no, I never said anything like that. Stay right there, Miss Garrett. How did you know my name? I didn't tell you my name. [busy signal from phone] * Sometimes I feel * I've lost control. * Sometimes I feel like * selling my soul. * Sometimes I like them * at the end of a rope. * Sometimes Sin * is my only hope, yeah. Get your ass upstairs. He already paid for you. OK please, you gotta listen to me, I need help. I was down here Whoa, slow down, slow down. You seem really tense This is he kind of place where you can relieve some tension, so to speak. This is the place where, you know, people go to, get away from husbands, wives, or even the world. Hence the name. This is "Secret's" So, go on, go get lost. Go create your own secret. [ripping sound] [moaning] Took a ride up to the country with Cameron, to the Catskill mountains to see his very adorable 3 bedrooms, 2 1/2 bath. It's all we've been talking about. [whistling wind noises] Hello? [muffled voices] [muffled voices] Hello. [sheet rubbing over something] [scream] [scream] [Lighter clicking] [screa m] [heavy breathing] [scream] [growling] [roar] [scared intake of breath] I smell you. [scream] [door slamming] [doorbell ringing] Hello, would you like to buy some candy for my White Point Wolverines football tea m? Fuck off! [door slam s] Our Father who art in Heaven hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for Thine is the Kingdom, and the power, and the glory, now and forever. * Amen [phone ringing] Hello. Hello Pamela. Hey John. How are you? Did I call at a bad time? Yes, it seems like I always do that. I either catch people when they're heading out, or just getting into the showe r. Either that or it's just a nice way to blow off a man of the cloth. As a matter of fact, I just talked to Mrs. Shotz, and I called her at a bad time, too . Although personally, I think she blows me off on purpose. You know, I haven't seen her at my services for the past 2 months. Ever since she came to confession , and didn't like what I had to sa y. Oh dear, I'm rambling, am I not? Pamela? Are you all right? Do you need to talk? I know these coming days must be very painful, it's right around now that you and Zack got... I need to talk to you in perso n. Is that all right with you? That would be fine. When? Tomorrow I could make my way towards... How about an hour? Can you make i t? Sure. Do you want to come to the Rectory? No, no, just meet me at the Church. OK? I'll see you soon. Whatever it is, be careful. [phone ringing] Hello. So, there I was sitting at Suggesta's Pizza Place. Waiting for my pal, Pam, for lunch. And what happens? She never shows. Dylan? So, I figure maybe she just forgot, or maybe, just maybe, she's getting laid . Pam, I told you calm down. All right. I'll be there. I'm coming. Trust me. [phone slamming down] Look I understand, all right? A man died, OK? That's very sad and I know you're traumatize d, but I'm here for you right now. Tell me what happened. I was working on the photos for the election spread. and I saw this man, scared to death, running for his life. These 3 women were chasing him and they followed him into the cemeter y. I followed them, taking photos of the m. Then my pager went off, and it was you. That's when they heard me and they saw me. So, I took off running, and I ran to the nearest payphone, and I called the polic e. And after my bizarre conversation with the police, all I heard was, "Stay right there, Miss. Garrett" So, why didn't you stay for the cops? I didn't trust them. Bullshit. They knew my name. You're famous. I didn't tell them my name. You must have. Oh no, no, I remember now right. This must have been it . You forgot because all these crazy people were chasing you. I don't know. I don't remember. But, I don't think I told them. You must have. But look who else then did you tell ? I was gonna tell Cameron, but I didn't, just you. OK. So where is this magic piece of film now? I hid it . You hid it. Yeah. Hey. Want another drink? Look, I think we should just get the role of film, and head over to Cameron's. Huh? I've been spending a lot of time inside the study lately. No, no, Pam. Look at me. I'm your friend, Dylan. I love you. Could it, did you tell anybody else about this? Did you? Nobody, just you . You're looking crazy, man. What are you doing ? I love you Pam. You got the fuckin' heat on in this fuckin' place? The oven or somethin g? Fuckin' ho t. You're sweating. Getting a little nervous? No. I'm your friend, remember? Baking the shit out of me in this place. You got the oven on, the heat? Hey. She knows. I didn't want to do this. Don't make me do this. I trusted you. Why are you doing this? You're still my friend. I don't want to hurt you. All I want is the roll of film. Why are you doing this? Don't do this to me. I don't want to hurt you . Give me the roll of film. And we won't hurt you. Promise you won't hurt me? Give me the roll of film now . OK, hold on. Give it to me! [smacking sound] Ah! Jesus. [heavy breathing] Don't hurt her. [muffled voices] [door closing] Its good to see you, Pamela. Oh John. Its so good to see you too. You have no idea what I've been through. I just wish he was still here to help me. It's difficult and painful to lose a loved on e. So, What specifically do you want to talk about? Heh, I really don't know where to begin. Start at the beginning. Things that feel real don't happen . I see people killed and then they vanish. Everywhere I go people stop and stare at m e. They follow me, they're trying to get a roll of film from m e. See people killed? Yes. Pamela, get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath and let's start again. OK my boss sent me on assignme nt to work on the election. Election, what electio n? OK, I saw this guy running through the cemetery. Three guys were chasing him and I followed taking pictures. They chased him into the cemetery where they met up with another group of guy s. And they're standing there, they did some sort of sacrifice or something, then they killed hi m. I watched them kill him from his gut to his throat . Then they spotted me, John, and I ran. Did you call the police? I called 911 and... they were in on it. The police. [whispers] They're all in on it. Pamela Hold on, then Dylan came by. He was in on the conspiracy as well. Dylan was in on it too. Yes, he threatened me, so I killed him with a hammer. Then I woke up for real and everything was gone. OK, I gotta know. Do you believe in black magic, witchcraft, shape shifters ? Pamela, I have a very good friend who lives in Saratoga. Her name is Naomi, and I believe, she can help you release some of this pain that's trapped inside you. I am not God damn craz y. Will you listen to me? I know what I'm saying sounds far-fetched, but it is the truth. Now tell me, do these things exist or not? Unfortunately, devil worshipers do exist. Black magic? As a priest, I can't believe in that. But, as for shape shifters and witchcraft, in some parts of the world they do. Except for Bobby Peters. Who is Bobby Peters? He was evil. He worshiped Satan. There are members of my church who believe he was possessed by the devil. Pam. My God help Pam. There was an exorcism. My God, what happened to him? I have no idea. Nobody knows. I have to track him down. I have to. That was a long time ago. What bearing could he have on whats happening to you no w? Who did this exorcism, John? I don't know, I wouldn't know how we'd find such things out. OK, well if you're not willing to help me then I will go myself. It was Zack, Pam. Zack conducted the exorcism. All right? Why didn't you tell me? Look. As far as the church is concerned, this never happened. Look, we petitioned the archdiocese, we were denied permission to conduct an exorcism, Zack did it anywa y.
