Attention platoon! Start in three. "On the trails of France and Navarra", Start in three. One, two, three! On the trails of France and Navarra A soldier sings, carrying paraphernalia A song which is Both traditional and peculiar With a chorus which goes: Long live cheap wine! ‪One, two! Cheap wine is also known as plonk Did you know? -Right turn! Right! -It warms you up wherever you may go! Come on soldier! Fill my quarter-liter carafe up Long live plonk Long live cheap wine in my cup! In the desert It is said the dromedary camel Is never thirsty you see, but it's just As legend has it between you and me If it doesn't drink it's because It only has clear water, don't you think? It'd drink up if it had cheap wine Then it would be fine! Plonk! One, two! Cheap wine is known as plonk, you know! It warms you up, wherever you may go Come on soldier Fill up my quarter-liter carafe Long live cheap wine! Long live plonk in my cup! Attention! March to the right! Right! One, two, one, two! Keep in line! Head up! Order on the right! One, two. Company halt! Column, hand salute. Stand to attention! Right turn! Right! Left turn! Left! Now, like at the Battle of Verdun show some spirit, goddammit! You'd think you were all puritans! Put your all into your singing. It's an excellent song, which you must proudly break into remembering the glorious sacrifice ­of our WWI soldiers at Verdun. If any of you are pretending to open your mouths to sing, I have my eye on you. Attention! Forward march! One, two, one, two, three, four. But all of a sudden, the Gallic rooster On a rooftop goes cock-a-doodle-doo As if to say stand up little soldiers I can see you! The sun shines, cannons thunder all around Young heroes Here a great battle can be found The battle of Verdun As victorious as can be… Right, left! Where a piecing cry sounds out you see Carried by the echoes of the dead On the Meuse's banks where blood was shed Halt! Watch your heads don't drop! Extend your arms! No more disdain or arrogance, phew! Off you flee barbarians and lackeys too… Louder! One, two! Chalumot! I can't hear you! It's that Chalumot again. I only ever hear about him. That boy must really be headstrong. Company, halt! Sergeant. Yes, Commander! Go and get me Chalumot! Chalumot, leave the ranks! Present yourself to the commander. Who are you? Chalumot, Commander! You've not been taught how to present yourself officially? Go back and then present yourself like a soldier. Student Chalumot! First section! Regimental number 2,154, sir! So you don't wish to sing, Chalumot? Why is that, please? Come on be honest! You know I like brave boys. I don't like these songs. Plus to sing you have to feel happy. And you're not happy, Chalumot? Explain yourself. Why aren't you happy? I'm listening. Because of life here, Commander! I didn't ask to join the youth troop. -My dad sent me here! -Enough! Your attitude confirms your superiors' accounts. But you will give in, Chalumot! You will cave! I give you my word. -Sergeant Billotet! -Yes, Commander? Put this individual in detention for a fortnight. Also send him back to the barber, I think his hair is too long. Here it's like being in the French Foreign Legion. March or die! Back in line! Company, forward, march! One, two. 8 NOVEMBER 1937 ANDELYS MILITARY PREP SCHOOL Baptiste isn't fat, he's just well-built. Hurry, Chalumot! You're way too slow, buddy! Pass me your plates. Go ahead, Pouliquen! Asshole… I don't want to do table duty, I told the sergeant. You wanted to be served, well here you go! You'll pay for that. Where are you off to, Chalumot? I'm getting some air, I can't do table duty. They are never happy. Go ahead Chalumot, do without food, that'll do you good. Silence! Okay? I brought you an apple. No thanks, I'm not hungry. Their apples are gross anyway. Where is Lepage? He is on duty. What are you reading? As you can see, it's a letter. Want to read it to me? Gelpoux, letters are personal. Of course, it's just that I never get any. Is it from your parents? No… It's a letter from my fiancée. How did you manage to get that? She signed it as if she were my aunt. What's your fiancée's name? Zezette, so she signs it aunt Zezette. Zezette is a pretty name. You'll get married? I'd love to, but she wants me to be an officer. Is she pretty? I'm going to see her over Christmas. We'll go to the movies, she's a fan like me. Pouliquen's coming! You treated me like an idiot earlier! Explain yourself. Leave him! No fighting. Shut your mouth! Chickening out, big mouth? Come fight me behind the john. I've been waiting for this for ages. 22, the sergeant is here. Stand up now! You know fighting is forbidden! Who started it? I did, sergeant! Well, you are both responsible. Chalumot you mustn't fight or you'll be in detention for Christmas. Pouliquen, you're on john cleaning duty. I will inform your parents. Go on, get to it! I'm sorry, Chalumot. You're a big jerk! He was meant to see his fiancée! Hey Chalumot, what are you thinking about? Don't worry, we'll get through. What are you doing here? I need you to take me to Paris or else I'm screwed. -Come on, get in then. -Come on in. It's like a school but for the military. We do drills all day and the officers are harsh. -Who enrolled you in that? -My father. Hear that Fernand! There are some really sick guys on this planet. Sending your kid to the barracks. As if there weren't enough soldiers! We'll unload at the covered market and we'll say a few words to your dad. No, you mustn't. Drive me to Paris, then I'll handle it. What will you do? My godfather lives in the country in Brévieux. He likes me, he'll help. I have a girlfriend, Zezette. -She writes every month. -Got any cash? No, you can't earn at the school but I'll see Zezette in Reims, then I'll buy a truck, like you. Do you think everyone is like us? We don't like the army. Here, take this. This is for you. No, thanks. Take it, kiddo, it's from the goodness of our hearts. Hey little guy, don't drink all that water. It'll make you ill. Come on, let's go drink a coffee. One coffee, two white wines. This will warm us up. Cheers to you, my boy. Feels good! Want a croissant? Do you have children? Marcel has two daughters. They're lucky. Tasty? Have another! No thanks, I need to go. -How much do I owe? -A franc! Don't forget. You know where to find us. Yes. See you, kiddo! -Bye, Marcel. -Bye! Bye! Come on, old boy! Zezette! Simon! Are you on leave? No. I ran away from school, I couldn't take it anymore. They tore up my cinema magazines you gave me. They shaved my head again, I was beaten up, deprived of my vacation. I can't stand it. You ran away? Yes, but you mustn't be mad. Are you going to your parents'? No way! You know my dad. I need civilian clothes, so I thought maybe you could-- Well, I don't know. I'll try. Wait for me here! I'll go look. What are you doing? Trying on my suits now? Will you answer me? It's for a school play, Dad… What's all this about? I didn't know Simon was in theater! So it's for him? It's for Chalumot? What is he doing here? What's going on? Zezette? Your daughter is lying! Well, not under my roof! Don't move and don't argue. Hands, Simon. Your dad will be disgusted. Come on then! I wasn't a cop for 20 years for nothing! I still have good instincts. I've things to be doing now. Thank you, Camparois. You've kept your sense of duty. Don't worry, he won't enjoy this for long. I'm taking him back. A retired policeman never goes off duty! I hope we'll see you again soon anyway, Simon. But next time with your stripes. You know, the army is all there is. Simon, why did you do this? Drink up. Come on, drink up. Want me to tell Zezette something? No handcuffs, what will people say? I don't give a damn! All I know is we've made huge sacrifices so he can become someone, and he deserts! Good God! There's a train at 8:10 p.m. Let's hurry. If we have to sleep at the station in Paris, so be it! That doesn't scare me! Come on, get up. Get up! Put his beret on properly, I'm ashamed enough! Look, there's Chalumot with his dad! Don't you hear the Marseillaise? Must I remind you to salute! I can't because of my handcuffs. I'm so ashamed of you. Commander, have you seen behind you? You brought your son back? Yes, sir! The police have been informed, they'd have found him soon. Commander, I request the honor of speaking with the school's major. Fine, follow me. Mr. Chalumot, as a father and an officer, I can imagine your grief. That said, I cannot take your son back, the rules are formal: in the incredibly rare event a student runs away, he is struck from the ranks. Your son is, how can I put it? An anarchist! Right, Des Aubelles? That's correct, Commander! Furthermore, student Chalumot doesn't deserve mercy or a special favor. He is an example of disobedience, rebellion and anarchy, as you said, Commander. I regret having to tell you, Mr. Chalumot, but that's how it is. We cannot set a precedent. I completely understand, Commander, but Simon isn't all bad. He came top in the canton for his school grades. Take me home, Dad, I'm not happy here. Shut up! Sergeant Major, enough! Des Aubelles, send young Chalumot to the infirmary, make sure no student sees him. Wipe your face, you disgrace! Wipe your face, Chalumot! You'll soil your uniform! Commander, here are the keys to the handcuffs. The scumbag! Come now, Mr. Chalumot. Calm yourself. We'll see if there's a way, given your service record, which I'm familiar with, to satisfy your sense of duty. France owes you that. I will honor the glorious ribbons that hung from your lapel. Thank you, Commander. You're saving me and his mom. I'm glad. She'd die of shame, poor woman! Before you leave, would you like to embrace your son? Oh no! I'd be unable to contain my rage, sir. I'd like just one more favor, Commander. What's that? Don't let him go on leave. Make him stay here, at school, and don't go easy on him anymore. Thank you, Commander! Lepage: 14! Lepage is making progress. Every bit of progress should be highlighted. Lepage, the only way is up. Baptiste: a surprise 15! Fifteen is good but when I read your text I was ashamed. Work on your writing, as calligraphy is very important. It's very important for a sub-officer, then you can calligraph all of your work! Calligraphy is a key element of being a sub-officer. -Alongside? -Discipline. Excellent! Chalumot! Chalumot you got 16. You did the best work, Chalumot! Well done! I've given you a 16. Aren't you happy? I don't understand you, Chalumot! Keep it up and you'll get a good rank at end of year and be allowed to go on vacation, like everyone else. One, two! Section one! Did you see Chalumot's grade? He's brown-nosing now, just thinking of his stripes. Whatever! He doesn't care about rank. You're jealous he got a better grade than you. You did so badly you won't even be a sub-officer! -Come on, guys! -Leave it alone! Shut up, ass-munch! Enough, calm down! Look at the newbies, they don't even know how to march! We were like that three years ago. You're as stupid as those rookies. It's not nice to make fun of them. There's no honor in knowing how to march or do a half turn. We should pity them. When they arrive they don't know they'll suffer three years under the orders of morons like Billotet. Degueldre, you like this military life. You've never known anything else. You love commanders and captains, with their shiny medals and decorations. Well, if it is, you're a dumbass. Go to the gym right away, Chalumot. On the double, I'm on your tail. So then, Chalumot, not so high and mighty now are we! Take that hat off, Chalumot. Come on, put them up, anarchist! Your speech was an insult to the French army. Get up! You don't have a right to hit me. You insult your comrades! You know what happens if I report this to the commander? Solitary confinement or boxing, you choose. What will it be? I prefer boxing. Ah boxing, Chalumot, excellent! Fight back you lazy piece of crap Communard! Get up, Chalumot! Stand up now! Go wash all of that off in the sink. Make sure you don't leave a single trace! Attention! At ease! The new lieutenant. Old, new, they all look the same! On my command, fire! On my command, fire! On my command, fire! Check your results! Baptiste, no good! It's no laughing matter. Degueldre, you did what you could, it wasn't enough. Gelpoux, excellent, great grouping. Chalumot, where are your bullets? You deliberately chose to shoot to the side. Know what these exercises cost the state? What's going on, Sergeant? It's Chalumot, Lieutenant! He won't shoot the target. -From day one this student-- -I know! Come over here, Chalumot. Student Chalumot, Simon. First section, number 2,154, Lieu­tenant. Are you near-sighted, Chalumot? -No, Lieutenant. -So, what then? I don't like shooting, Lieutenant. Explain your thoughts, Chalumot? May I speak frankly? I'd prefer you did, yes. Well, I don't like shooting. I always hated hunting with my godfather. But you're here to learn the military profession. I've had no say in the matter. Perhaps. Yet during a conflict, if you don't shoot, the enemy will. I know, but I still don't like it, Lieutenant. That's your point of view, Chalumot. But keep it to yourself. Back to your place. Sergeant, no sense in worrying. This student's results are due to a migraine. Dispense him of this exercise for eight days until he gets his strength back. All assemble at this point! Three rows now, get in line! Space out nicely! Attention! Forward, march! One, two. Quickly! Maybe you want me to help? Come on! Carry on, you'll get a piece of my mind. How much longer? Three kilometers, keep going Lepage. I don't care about the exam, I can't keep going. I don't give a damn, either. But if you don't pass, we'll be split up. Come on, you're my best friend. Chalumot, faster! What do you want to be asked? Hopefully they'll question me on Charlemagne, I know my stuff on him! I want kings! -Doesn't surprise me! -Thanks! So how was it? Tough, I had Azincourt. Jeez! Next. Come on then, Chalumot! At ease. Choose one. OK. Oh. Chalumot got lucky. He picked Napoleon as war leader. We just studied that! We're listening. Napoleon Bonaparte was born in Ajaccio in 1769. After studying at Brienne military school… Well, gentlemen, I'm delighted to note that, as usual, our results are far better than civilian establishments! So, no other issues then? The eternal issue of Chalumot. In fact, I believe Bargheloni, who is in charge of his section, wishes to speak with you. Lieutenant, I'm listening. Commander, student Chalumot is a rather special case. You're telling me! He is far from stupid. Without the practical trials, he'd be in the top ten for the exam. He clearly has a negative reaction to the army. Negative! What do you think about it? -Me? -Yes. You know, Commander, Chalumot is a particularly intelligent student. He can't be beaten on questions about Antiquity or Napoleon. But when asked about the last war, for example, he basically refuses to answer. It's as if current challenges bother him! You mean to say, professor, that Chalumot only appreciates soldiers when they're dead? I'm not defending him, Commander, I'm just saying it's a rather unusual problem, a totally unique case. Actually, Commander, I've observed a sense of honor in this student, a rather encouraging candor. What conclusions do you draw from it? In all honesty, given his attitude, I'd say it's best to free him from his contract in the army. At his age, he can still find a job in civilian life. I share that opinion. If I understand you rightly gentlemen, you're suggesting Chalumot be expelled from school after just arriving…? 28th, Commander. 28th out of 150 for the end of year exam. Your reasoning is curious for an officer, Bargheloni! A Saint-Cyr graduate? I am, Commander! You chose to be in the army, Bargheloni? Yes, Commander. This Chalumot boy hates the army, and yet he's intelli­gent. Yes, he is. No, he's an anarchist-minded youth. Soviet vermin. That boy is under sub­versive influence. That's the seed that the Popular Front has planted in today's youths. And you want him "freed", as you put it! Well, no way, Lieutenant! Chalumot will fulfill his duty in his chosen career. That's exactly it. Chalumot didn't choose anything, his father-- Enough, Lieutenant! Chalumot will stay in the army. You'll see, he'll end up thanking us for being so firm with him. What do you think, professor? You're right, Commander! I hadn't thought of the Popular Front's influence. Excellent. So, we agree! Gentlemen, let's announce the results. Des Aubelles, make sure his classmate, what's his name again? Lepage, Commander! That's it. Make sure he's transferred to another section at Tulle school. That boy is under Chalumot's influence. As for you, Lieutenant, in a few years' time you'll approve of my action. Let's go, gentlemen! Baptiste, Baptiste! Chalumot! Goodbye, sir! Chalumot. -Bye, sir. -Bye, Gelpoux. Gelpoux, Lepage, Andelys' boys, remember: honor and loyalty. Goodbye, boys. Robillard is nice! But I hate that he gave me eight. You deserved it. Are you going to the station? Can I join you? So, they separated you. You always agree with what they decide, you must be happy! Perhaps, but they're harsh! You'll be alone now, Chalumot! Pouliquen, when we argued I called you an asshole. I was wrong, you're not an asshole, Pouliquen, you're a victim. You trying to be mean? No. Lepage, at Tulle military school do Andelys school proud, make sure you're amongst the best! Yes, Sergeant. So, Chalumot, no hard feelings, I hope. I've met other strong-willed students like you and they became excellent officers. We're all from the same family. I was also a child of the troops. I was hard on you, that's a fact. You'll soon see it's for your own good! Let's wipe the slate clean. Should we kiss as well, Sergeant? I've not forgotten. I do hope you get a newbie like me next year to get your kicks. Get out before I lock you up! Thug! Don't bother, Sergeant. Oh, and screw you! Scumbag! I hope they make your life miserable at Tulle! Sergeant! Sergeant! I'm really happy. When I get home, I'll have them all framed. I'm going to have a nice wood frame made. My grandma can have it, she'll love it! I'll put it in the dining room, it'll be seen more. True, you must show off things like that. You're so right, Chalumot. You're crazy, Chalumot. He's nuts. That's not the end of it. Dead Men Standing by Mr. Jacques Pericard with nice images of WWI soldiers singing the Marseillaise. Anyone like it? I like war stories, Chalume. You're right. Sold! Thanks! We've arrived! Come on guys, we have to go or we'll miss the connection. Tours Station, end of the line! Travelers changing for Reims, stay on the same platform. Look out! The train's about to leave! See the Prytanée guys' cool uniform? How cool are they! We can talk to them on the train! -Easy does it with my candy! -I'm going to see the Prytanée guys. Hey! Watch my paint brushes! Hi. I'm Degueldre. We're from Andelys, heading to Tulle. No need to be arrogant. You can still be polite. You're just soldiers like us. Enough! We've nothing in common. Keep annoying us we'll file a report with our commander. Forget it, Degueldre. They're assholes! Ignore them, they're assholes! With a bit of luck, you'll look like them one day! What will you do then? I'll leave the army as soon as I can. Simon, time to get up! -Hi, Mom! -Hello. -Is that hot chocolate? -Yes. Hurry, your dad hates you having breakfast in bed. After you've had it, you must get up. It's best not to upset him. Sleep well, soldier? Yes, Dad! Hurry up, we'll both head out to do some shopping. Get to it! In uniform, Simon! Okay? In uniform! Get going! Thank you, Father. When I met the colonel in Beirut… See, he saluted us! Here's the boy! -Hello! -Hello, company! -Is that your son? -Yeah. -Yeah. -Great. He's 20, a future officer! He'll amount to a lot, especially in writing, isn't that right, Simon? Come on then, I must introduce you to folk from my department: Pradier's from the same area as your dad: Lozère. Say hello and give him a salute. Oh no! Don't bother saluting. -Hello, Simon! -Hello, sir. Glad to be home, eh? Better than acting the fool at the barracks, right? Your dad has some strange ideas. The African sun obviously fried his brain. Damn Pradier! Always the same old bullshit! That clown never changes. Admit what you're doing makes no sense! You can't force your kid to be a soldier! Face it! You know how I feel, we've discussed it enough. I never get on your case because we're both from Lozère and I'm a storekeeper, I have to respect my customer's opinions. But seeing you come in here with your son dressed for a carnival drives me mad! Enough, dammit! Look, Pradier… No! I'm not finished! Don't you realize you're slowly killing your kid? Look at him! He's scared. He's scared of you! He doesn't dare laugh, sing or have fun like other kids his age. You're not his father, Chalumot, you're his sergeant major. Well, I've said my piece. It had to be said. This round's on me. No. It's over between us. I'll never set foot in here again. I'll buy my tobacco elsewhere. You're a bastard, Pradier! It was for people with cushy jobs like you that I took a bullet at Verdun and Chemin des dames… You weren't there! You took it easy. You just fattened yourself up, lily-livered coward. We're not going to fight all day, are we? What does your boy want to drink? He'll drink a picon like his dad. It won't hurt him. Right, Simon? I'd rather not have a picon, Dad. I'd prefer grenadine. See? His mom brings him breakfast in bed and here's the result! What do you think? What? Your kid's on vacation! Spoil him a bit. Spoil him? Know when my first leave was? Five years after my engagement in Indochina! Five years! What do you have to say about that? That it's no reason to force your son to drink picon like you! Well he won't drink here and neither will I! And I'll tell other veterans! We'll never come here again! -Stop this nonsense. -Asshole! Come on, Simon. Let's go. You want to decide what's best for my son? You can shove your picon where the sun don't shine! -Oh, come on! -Shut the hell up! Shut up or I'll lay into you Pradier! You're a total scumbag. Know what I think? You're worse than a German! Let's go, goddamn it! Worse than a German! That Pradier is an asshole. A deserter! He took advantage, I couldn't think of good comebacks. But I'll think of some good comebacks. Later. That bastard! He laughed at me! We'll go back! Hear me? We'll go back and let him know what's up, that scumbag! -Are you coming? -Where? To Pradier's! To tell him. No. -Why not? -Because. Are you ashamed? Ashamed of your father? Just say it. You agree with Pradier? Come with me, Simon. Or get the hell out of here. Understood? I understand, Dad. You understand what? That I need to pack my bags! I'm better off in the country. Zezette told me to… Don't bother, Mom. Why don't you stay at home? Your father doesn't know how to say it, but he wanted you with us on vacation. That's not what he said earlier! You know your father loves you deep down, in his own way. It doesn't matter. You really don't want to stay? No, Mom. I don't know what to tell Dad anymore. -Will you write to us? -Yes. Say hi to Claudius from us. You're all grown up! You're like a man now! Take this. From your dad. He didn't want me to tell you. Give your mom a kiss, Simon. Alright, Simon? -Fine, uncle! -Are you well? Yeah. -Want a sip? -No, thank you. You're no soldier, Simon! You don't drink. You constantly read books and papers. No surprise you and your dad don't see eye to eye. The important thing is you're happy. Let's take this to be fermented. You hired help? This is my nephew, Octavie's son. The soldier? Yes, he's on vacation. This is Francis, my neighbor. He has a big mouth! Hello, sir. Hello, my boy. So you're your father's son? Let me tell you, boy, when I see your sergeant dad, I always tell him: "Your job is for lazy slobs. You don't wake up at five to wash cows or plough! While us hillbillies, as you city folk call us, work our asses off from morning until night, in summer and winter, goddammit! With all the taxes we pay, we make you rich, we put food in your mouths. What are you good for? You bunch of lazy slobs! Nothing!" I told your father, "Soldiers are the bane of France!" They disgust me! Think it's funny? You're just like your dad! When your sergeant dad came here, he kept drinking, smoking, chatting non-stop about the war! Give me a light, big mouth! And leave him be, he has eight days left of his vacation so let him enjoy it! He likes soldiers even less than you, jerk! Really! And me, talking as if to his father! Come over tonight with Claudius for a tipple. If you don't like soldiers, let's shake on it. Come on, then, come on! 1 OCTOBER 1938 TULLE MILITARY ACADEMY -Hi Degueldre! How are you? -Hello, Chalumot. -This is Braval. -Hi, how are you? Where do I sign up? Over there, but they're not very nice. They can't be worse than at Andelys! Bye! -Pouliquen! -Hi Chalume! -How are you? -Alright. Silence! Your name? Chalumot, Simon. Go into the duty sub-officer's office. Your records. So you're Chalumot? Yes. That's what it says. It sure does. You know, we've heard about you. This place is different. Stay in line, you'll be fine. Is that clear? -Yes, Sergeant! -Dismissed. Faster, goddamn it! Hurry up, faster! Faster! Gather near the frame. Come on! Okay then. Now, over the frame. I'll time you one by one. You! Must I send you a letter? Your name is? Baptiste, Sergeant! Baptiste! Do you want my foot up your ass? Understood? Go on then! I'm scared of heights, Sergeant. You're here to learn to overcome your fears. Don't force him, Sergeant, he has vertigo. Who sent me a freak like this… Name? Chalumot, Sergeant! Ah, you're Chalumot! I heard about you! A hefty record, I believe! You tried to run away, right? Yes, Sergeant! Don't smirk, it's no laughing matter! Meanwhile, you can start off the course and set an example for your comrade. Understood? Yes, Sergeant. Off you go. Not so proud anymore, Chalumot? Buck up, buttercup! See? If Miss Chalumot can do it, a big man like you can, too. Go on, Baptiste! Faster! Hurry! Move forwards or I'll give you a reason to! Come on, a bit more effort and you'll get there. Stand up, Baptiste! A bit further! Get up! -Shit! -Damn! Quick, tell the infirmary! Okay, Sergeant! Satisfied, Chalumot? It's Veillard's fault Baptiste is dead. His folks may request an inquest. Baptiste didn't have parents. He was a ward of the State. Don't expect an investigation! There's nothing we can do. Yes, there is! What? Nothing. "The undersigned first section students ask Captain Maryla to take action against Veillard who forced student Baptiste to climb the frame he fell off, although he warned him of his vertigo." I signed it! Sign it, I'll go to the captain. United, we have power. -Too risky! -I'm out. If we do nothing now, this will continue. -They won't do anything. I'm not signing. -Yeah, he's right. -I'll sign! You chicken? -No. Whiners with no balls. Anyway, I don't care if I lose my stripes. Are we decided, then? Don't do it, it's pointless! Leave me alone! COMMANDER MARYLA'S OFFICE Come in. You wanted to see me, Chalumot? Be clear and concise, I'm listening. Captain, it's about Baptiste's death. It was an accident! A regrettable accident. What about it? It wasn't an accident, Captain. What do you mean? Sergeant major Veillard forced Baptiste to climb the frame. Baptiste was terrified, he had vertigo, understand, Captain? Sergeant Veillard forced him to do it. I witnessed it. He doesn't have the right to do that. It's in the school's rules! Enough, Chalumot! I won't tolerate slander of officers, particularly Sergeant Veillard, who is a remarkable leader. Chalumot, Baptiste was the victim of an accident! Proof! You tried getting your comrades to sign a petition accusing Sergeant Veillard, but they refused. Enough! Hear me, Chalumot? Some advice for you: fall in line and don't bother me again with your drivel! You snot-nosed shit! Goddamn it! If you'd seen me in the French Foreign Legion, in Sidi Bel Abbès. They knew how to train men there! I have no hope to offer you. And to begin with, no furloughs for you for a month. Dismissed! Chalumot! Captain. You haven't written to your parents for months. Could you tell me why you treat your mother and father in such a way? I can't hear you? I've nothing to tell them, Captain. Chalumot, you are most definitely a monster! A monster who refuses to write to his parents. They don't love me. There's no point in writing. Not even your parents love you! No one, Chalumot! No one! You will write a long letter to your parents. Is that clear? Or I'll send you to the hole! I'd rather go to prison, Captain. You'll write to your parents and go to the hole. Get out! Here, Chalume, you didn't eat. Have some chocolate. Of course, good old Molière had issues. With the Church, the courts, even the king. Above all, his friends, family. So one of his main plays, written in 1664, wasn't performed publicly until 1669. And it was immediately banned. So then, who can tell me the name of the masterpiece by Mr. Jean-Baptiste Poquelin? With Elvire, Orgon… Tartuffe, sir. Well done! If you like, we will study that play together. We will ask Chalumot to do us the honor of recounting what happens in the play he will see on Sunday as he came top in French. A Parisian troupe will perform it at Tulle. I can't on Sunday, I'm in detention! Again! What was the reason this time? It was Sergeant Veillard, sir. So then, what happened with dear Veillard? He was annoyed, sir. He spoke to him like out of a book. Explain yourself! What the devil? Well, sir. Chalumot spoke to the sergeant like a poet! Yes, that was it, sir! He spoke in verse. For example? "I'm sorry, Sergeant, I have to say I didn't make my bed the right way!" Not bad! Another example? "Sergeant, I'm in pain I'm off to the loo I ate too many beans I need a poo" So you are a victim of your love for poetry. That's not a crime. I'll speak with the military authorities. Detained for being a poet. Sir, Chalumot's written something. Mind your own business! So then Chalumot, clearly you're hiding your talent from me! Braval, explain yourself. What has your comrade written? Well, sir, Chalumot has written a screenplay, a whole notebook. It's called The Mercenary. He wants to make movies. Okay, back to Molière. Take notes. Chalumot, I'd like to read your script, seriously. Unless you'd rather I didn't? It's not that, sir… But it's no good. I've never read a real script you see. We'll discuss it on Sunday! Gentlemen, contemplate this famous quote: "Laughter makes us human." Then, acquitted of this initial duty, as it has been handed over to another who will need to fill the role for us so with some beautiful nuptials, they can honor the passion of a generous and sincere lover in Valère. That was great, sir! True. Would you like more pie, Mr. Chalumot? I'll gladly have some more! I'd like a bit more too, please. Thank you. Did you like the theater, Chalumot? Yes, sir! It was almost as good as going to the movies. I read your script, Chalumot! I know nothing about movies, but your text was packed full of ideas. Truly. Ever read All Quiet on The Western Front? No, sir. Curious. Your screenplay in some ways resembles the book by Maria Remarque. Here, have this. But careful, Chalumot. Reading such books and your passion for cinema are not to Captain Maryla's liking. Try… to tone it down. I mean, with your superiors. Take it easy. Easy to say. I know. It's not easy. But hold on, Chalumot. At the end lies freedom. I'm sure you'll get a second chance at life. I will try, sir. And thank you. For what? For the theater, for this invitation, for the cakes, for the book… For everything. Well it's time we get going, you mustn't be late, the Captain would never forgive me. Goodbye, ma'am. Thank you for everything. Some Sunday in the future, come and have lunch, we'll have time to chat. Would you like that? Of course, sir! See you soon, Simon! Goodbye, sir. And thanks again. Goodnight! IN MEMORY OF FORMER STUDENTS WHO DIED FOR THEIR HOMELAND So then, Chalumot, I don't know what you're plotting, but in recent weeks you've kept your head down. Keep it up and you'll spend Easter with your parents. I don't know, Sergeant. About what? If my parents would take me in, Sergeant. In any case, keep staying in line. Finish up here, then do the shitters. Yes, Sergeant. Okay? Not too tough I hope. I brought On the Western Front. It's really brilliant. I think it's a movie too. I bet it's great. I prefer books. When I get out of the army, I'd like to work in a bookshop. I'd put this on display, I love it. I told Braval about it. He's interested. I'll give it to him. Make sure it doesn't get around too much. You never know with Veillard. Silence! Chalumot, to the Captain's office. Hurry! Chalume is in trouble again. ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT To think your superiors thought they'd succeeded! But crocodiles sleep with one eye open. You've overstepped the mark, this time. A German book, and from what I read, it insults the army, it ridicules it with the aim of inciting youths to rebel and revolt! Wonderful! Your dad fought the Krauts in 1914! Lucky your comrades aren't scumbags like you. Mention Braval's merit for what he did at roll call. As for you, Cha­lumot, I won't go easy on you. Unless… Tell me who gave you this book. I can't remember. You'll do eight days in the hole to refresh your memory! You're a bastard, Chalumot! Did you know that? No, Captain! I didn't think it was forbidden to read this book. It's sold all over town, it's even a film. Civilian life and military life are two totally different things! Nothing should interest you outside of the barracks. Personally, I'd like to crush every future revolutionary, ringleader and rebel. I'll ask the colonel to ban the sale of this rubbish in town. Now get out of here! As for this filthy rag, here! Chalume, it's me, Pouliquen. I brought some food. I also got you some smokes and chocolate. Careful, I don't want to get caught. Chalumot's rations, Sergeant. Come through! Keep your spirits up, Chalume! In three weeks it's vacation. Thanks Pouliquen! Fire! Reload! On my command, fire! -Reload! -Faster! Hurry up! Faster! Rally near the frame! These boys seem in top form and happy, isn't that right, sir? How long do they spend at Tulle? Two years, Deputy! Oh! Then what? They're placed with a unit for a few months then join a regiment for four years as a sub-officer. Colonel, will we get a chance to talk to these youngsters? As you wish, you can chat to three sections of the second year. Colonel, isn't this a bit dangerous for these youngsters? No. -Fire! -Don't you want a hand perhaps? We should tell the deputies what goes on here. How wonderful youth is, Colonel! Definitely, Deputy. He said he'd speak to the deputies, to complain about the superiors, Sergeant Veillard and even… Go on, Braval. Continue. Even you, Captain! Good work, Braval. Well done! By telling us this, you have done the army and your school proud. You deserve your stripes. Don't worry. Chalumot will pay. Go on, Braval. Attention! Future sub-officers and officers of our great army, I salute you on behalf of the nation. From your ranks will emerge future leaders and victorious generals. We all know the German beast is snarling at our borders. We also know that when the time comes… Chalume's in the first section's last row how weird! Look out! …with the same heroism as your glorious elders. Long live the French army, its superiors and young troops! Now, with your superiors' consent, right, Colonel, we'd like to hear some of you speak freely. We'll pass on your concerns to the chamber. Those who wish to speak to the deputies, raise your hand. Yes. I'd like to know why when we go into town we see papers attacking the army, our superiors? Brown-noser! Young man, your question is justified. Traitors of our motherland are leading campaigns against the army. But I assure you, harsh measures will be taken to crack down on such actions. Absolutely! Any other questions? No other questions? I got tossed out of the dorm. Thibaudeau's raiding it, searching everywhere, even under beds! Where are you going? I'm sure it's to do with me! What are you doing here? You know you can't come to your room after roll call? Get out! Want me to throw you downstairs at full speed? Give me that suitcase. No. It's mine and it holds books Mr. Brizoulet gave to me. I don't want them confiscated, damaged. They're not dirty books are they? No, they're not erotica or porn, they're study books. Drop that or you'll be in serious trouble! I'm not used to students defying me, understood? For the last time, drop that, or else… No! You don't have the right to hit me. That's all you lot ever think about. Always hitting and beating! I'll teach you, you brat! Don't come any closer! You can't rattle me! You're too much of a coward to jump. Coward! You're the coward! You abuse your stripes. It's not me! I didn't want be here, my parents sent me! Enough of this comic spectacle! Get down now, that's an order. No, I've had enough! I'm done! I've had enough of you, this school, my parents! Come any closer and I'll jump! No, you won't. You're wrong. You're coming round now. Mr. Brizoulet. I'm here, Simon. Would you like anything? For you to put my books away safe. Call it done, Simon. Don't worry. Take him off! Hurry. Don't stay here, get to class! I'll come to the hospital to chat to you soon. Stay strong, young lad! Hurry it up! Tell your students it is officially forbidden to discuss this with anyone. Say you'll be checking their letters. As for you, Thibaudeau, come with me. I have some instructions for your report. That's all gentlemen, off you go! Gentlemen, the doctor is visiting. Mr. Le Roy, you seem to have recovered well. You can soon be discharged. So then young man! I get the impression you're doing a lot better and does your arm still hurt? -A bit doctor. -It's healed well! You shouldn't attempt suicide at your age. The good Lord punished you. Cut him some slack, Mother. He is still injured. It's his soul that is damaged. I treated brave young soldiers during the war and they could have complained but not him. This afternoon, we will remove your cast and you can walk. Thanks, doctor! -May I? -Of course! Ah, Madame Bovary! That's a wonderful book. A wonderful book, please! It's just another book about adultery! I forbid patients to read such rubbish in my hospital. Come on, Mother! -Sister Beatrice? -Yes. Make sure you help this Antichrist to the laundry room. Make sure you don't catch him reading pornographic books or movie magazines. Your hair has grown back fast, my little Simon. This place has changed me. At the barracks they shave it off. They'll re-shave it. When you go back? You're still here for a month, don't think about that, Simon. Yes, miss. Call me sister. For the last time, call me sister. -I've tried but I never remember. -Lord, how pig-headed! I'll end up listening to mother and I'll get mad with you. Are you sad, Simon? No mi… sister. I managed to get this back for you. Make sure Mother Superior doesn't catch you out. -Here you go. -Thanks. You will be able to read now, Mother Superior is asleep. -Goodnight, everyone. -Goodnight, Sister Beatrice. Do you believe in God, Simon? No miss! And yet you are Catholic? It's what my parents wanted like everything else. But why don't you believe in God? It's hard to explain. Who do you believe in then, Simon? Or what rather? Not a lot, apart from I believe in you, miss, and I'd do anything for you. Without thinking twice. Well I'd like to ask you something. Promise me you'll never do what you attempted to do, ever again. What, miss? Wanting to kill yourself. Promise me. You couldn't understand. I've been living a life I hate for four years. I started at the age of 13. My parents told me it was like any other school but the only difference is you don't have to pay. I'm about to turn 17 and I've a year left, and then five years' service to repay the state. That's not fair, is it? I understand, Simon. But swear you will never do it again. Simon, look at me. Swear to me! You truly want me to? Swear to me! I swear! All right, Simon? I'm leaving tomorrow, miss. I'd have liked to say bye. I know. Go into the dressing room, I'll join you. I'll miss you a lot, Simon. I will think about you a lot. Now you need to sleep because of Mother Superior. Goodbye, Simon, and may God protect you more than anyone else as you doubt His existence. Simon, we mustn't do this. I will never forget you. Will you come back? Every Sunday. Go on then. Simon, you can't ever see me again. Ever! Miss. Never, Simon, promise me. You're annoyed with me, you're mad at me? Quite the opposite! That's why you mustn't see me again, promise me. I promise. So then, Chalume, is it true you are a virgin? Yes, that's true! What does that prove? It proves you go mouthing off, but I bet you've never been to a brothel even just for a drink! That's also true, so, are you happy? You hear that guys, Chalume hasn't had his wicked way with anyone! You're pretty weak for an anarchist. You mouth off round here. Yes, I do. Have you seen your big gob? Have you seen it? I'll show you it. Look at that, my God. Look at your ugly mug, Petrus. Look at your ugly mug! Rub cream into it, gel your hair back. You'll always have a military moronic ugly mug! You lousy maid screwing brothel barfly! No Petrus! I'll tell you something, you've never made love either as all you've done is screw around. You'll be going to Limoges on Saturday for a serious medical appointment with a psychologist from a military hospital. I'm not ill, Commander. That's not the opinion of Marshall Thibaudeau, the other officers and a number of your comrades. So you will go to the appointment. If you're declared mad, you will leave the school and most likely the army. I don't think anything could be better for you. Not under those circumstances. I'll leave the army but with a healthy body and mind. I can prove that I am completely lucid. How is that, young hothead? By working, ranking high and trying to be among the best. I'm sure I can do it. How curious! In a word, do as you please, whether it's for good or bad. You are a nasty piece of work, Chalumot! Okay, but this is your last shot. But I warn you, any slight slip-up and I'll send you off escorted to Limoges, understood? Yes, Commander. And another piece of advice, read less Shakespeare, Molière and Sten­dhal. Reading all of those have an awful effect on you. Instead work on science, math and above all history, in particular, military history which you are really weak at. See, you have a lot on your plate. Now clear off. Here he is, Chalume the nutter. He seems to have woken up this morning. What did you say? Repeat it? He's right. Chalumot could be dangerous. Let's put him in a cage. He's been chilled out for three months but you can never trust nutcases. He needs a straitjacket. He could be dangerous. Go on, repeat what you said! I'll tell on you to the sergeant. What will you tell him? You better watch out, you pea brain! What's all of this? Gentlemen, quieten down, please. I understand you are impatient to know the result of your essay but even so. Let it drop Gelpoux, they are real jerks. Thanks anyway! Sit down. Robillard, good work but watch your spelling. Braval, fourth: 14 out of 20, that's good. But you underestimated the role of General Joffre. Chalumot: third! You have truly surprised me. The Battle of The Marne gave you wings. Mr. Chalumot: 15 out of 20. Congratulations. Commander, where is the commander? It's fine, we'll all stay here! Too bad! We must cross the barricade right away. Hey, Bruno! Will you show me how it works? Shh! After the film… Attack! THE END A few days away from the results, I decided to gift you with the screening of this wonderful patriotic film. I asked your French teacher, Mr. Brizoulet, to ask you to write a dissertation on this film. As a reward, the three best will be able to exceptionally dine in the officers' mess hall. Thanks, gentlemen. Young Braval will go far but tell me this, my dear Brizoulet, I've not seen the copy of your protégé's work? I'd prefer not to show you Chalumot's work. Please, show me the masterpiece! I HATE YOUR WAR It's clear and precise. For a top French student it's lacking in development, don't you think? I don't think he reacted with bad intentions or in an attempt to be contrary. No doubt he decided to give up the reward to one of his comrades. Don't bother trying to convince me, Mr. Brizoulet. After all, I'm happy he isn't one of the top students. It would have been hard for me to see him sat by the officers. We'll leave it there. Chalume, Chalumot! You're 20th and Braval got less than you, you got 14 on average! What did you get? I came 62nd. -Do you smoke now? -A bit! You're lucky, you can choose. 20th! Where do you want to go? Versailles regiment. Tank or engineer? I don't care. It's just it is near Paris. Then I could go to the movies. Your dad will be happy. Plus if we go to war like they say, you would end up as a corporal. I'll stay in my hole in Perpet. You'll be better off in your hole than at war! Fall in! On my command, attention! You have just found out your end of school results. You should normally choose your advanced training center now, according to your ranking. But current events have changed this. War has just broken out and we are all being enlisted. Upon orders of the minister, the youth troops that are old enough to be enlisted will be sent to regiments corresponding to their training. What do you think? I want to go on a massive blowout. We just have time before we go. Coming Chalume? I'm not hungry. What if we went to the movies? What do you think? No guys. I'll meet you at the station. I have someone to see. Come with us! Come on, Chalume! What's got into him today? Excuse me, miss, know where I can find Sister Beatrice? No, I'm new here but I can perhaps find out. What are you doing here, Mr. Chalumot? I'm looking for Sister Beatrice. No doubt. Why, may I ask? I'm heading off to the Maginot line. So I just wanted to say goodbye. Sister Beatrice left to go to a military hospital on the front line, upon her request. Tell me where she is? It's pointless you insisting, if you don't go immediately, I will call your superiors. Ask the center's messenger, there is general mobilization! Corporal, your papers please? Where are you off to? The train awaits! I was just going. The station's that way. Simon, oh yes! Your train leaves in an hour. Come on, we'll accompany you! In case you want to get lost. It's funny, many are getting lost! What were you doing? Hurry up! Go on, Corporal! No funny business, okay! Yeah, it'll all be fine! Is there a free seat? -You can see there are eight of us. -Sorry! Is there a seat in here? Yeah there is! Hello guys! -Hi! -All off to the Maginot line? Yeah, but all in different fields! That's unfortunate if you're buddies, eh? -Want a sip? -He never drinks! You can tell he never drinks! Just a small drop, thanks! Think about your buddies, eh! -Want some? -Thanks! Alright? Hey, are you okay? Want another drop? -Hi guys! -Hi! This is great, Corporal, it covers the other bunker's fire! It's excellent, Corporal! The commander isn't exactly one of your biggest fans but keep it up to get a commendation in the regiment order! Thanks, Captain, but it's not worth it. Ah, I spoke to the commander about your cinema club idea. He is fine with the idea but doesn't want you to run it. So we will re-discuss it at your billeting. Okay. For the billeting, don't be too zealous, Chalumot! Oh, there's no danger of that, Captain. You know we're all a bit bored here, nothing ever happens. Are you complaining? No, Captain. Just making an observation. The Germans are crushing the Polish and here it's dead quiet. On the hill opposite, there is an artillery barrage nearly every day at this time. But it doesn't last very long! Did you clean these rooms? Yes, Captain! You're a funny joker, Corporal. You're the first nice anarchist I've met. I was told you went out on patrol without your ammunition. If that's true I'll put you on a fizzer. I always forget them, Captain! Stop messing about, Chalumot! I won't tell you again! You know, I'd like to watch your movies if you ever make any! Perhaps you'd be talented at it. Hey guys, grub's up! Come over here, Corporal! We'll sit in the corner by the fire like at home. We've a cushy seat here! It's warm, isn't it? It does you good! Foucart, you were lucky to work on the movies! How do you get into a movie-making crew? You know, Corporal, I'm more of a tech guy, not a Renoir, so advice-wise… It's still really great! Yeah, it's fun, it's great, but it's tough. Especially for what you want to do: directing. It's really hard to do it. But work hard and you'll get there because you have it in you. After this damn war I'll introduce you to my head tech guy, Bébert. He knows everyone, he's even chatted to Gabin! Foucart? Corporal? You know, I'd love that, I'd truly love it. Don't worry, Simon. To start with we'll find you a showy job, a role as master corporal, for example. You'll see, it'll work! I met a young guy like you, he's come a long way. Know who it is? Marcel Carné. So you see! Hide! Alright, Foucart? Come on guys, advance, hide behind the tank. No! No! Stop! Good God, stop! He can't hear! He can't hear, Corporal. Stop! Corporal, the nurses will arrive in 30 minutes. That's too late, now or he will die! No way, the second section was hit, we've injured men. So they are prioritizing their care. We must do something right now! Know where the rural hospital is, Chalumot? More or less, yes! Take my car and go there! Foucart load him into the car. Come on guys, hurry it up. Thanks, Captain! Don't get too excited. I'm afraid we'll see many more injured. Make sure you take good care of my car. Heading for? The military hospital. Is it far? You can't get through. The Germans have launched an attack. -Wait for it to die down. -Thanks. Son of a regular sub-officer, young Simon Chalumot was sent out to fight early and enlisted in the youth troop. His exemplary behavior has earned a commendation from his superiors. He had just joined our regiment and everyone liked him. Simon Chalumot, first sub-officer killed on the Maginot line, died for France. He is the epitome of bravery and heroism. Mowed down by the artillery when driving a German soldier to our infirmary, Corporal Chalumot took it upon himself to carry out the French army's traditions of gallantry! As decided by the commandant-general of the division, Corporal Chalumot will be mentioned in dispatches by his division and put forward for a military medal so that his memory will stay etched in our memories and in those of the youths who will join our military schools just like he did. Sergeant Major Chalumot, your son died for the army. The army salutes him. When I think he could have been officer. The little sod. Present arms! Subtitle translation by: Fiona Tindale
