They make a good mai tai for a twat bar but seriously overpriced. 2 million Dollars for a round of drinks. And the pussy ain't even that hot. Jody. l'm doin' business here. Jody! Come on, get the fuck out of here. 2 milllion dollars. Suck a dick, you prick bastard. You don't have shit on us. What do you think of this? Cops never found these at the scene. Just 2 dead narcs and 3 dead Jamaicans. Ballistics is gonna reveal that the slugs that killed my partners.. . . . .didn't come from the Jamaicans. So there were others involved. As for myself, l was never there. Wow. Dead guys tell no tales. Yeah. Why don't you ask your pal here? What the fuck you talkin' about? You blew my partner Stevie's balls off with a .38 snubnose. A real distinctive piece. Stainless. polished up like a spic's hubcap. Now, let me take a wild guess here. l think that you gave him the gun to dump in the river. Now, l'm assuming that he never got around to it, because 2 hours ago, his next door neighbor took a slug in the shoulder. The shooter was the guy's 10-year-old stepson. Who was over at Gazelle's house 2 hours earlier. What the fuck you ryin' to do here? Huh? You tryin' to fuckin' play us? 'Cause you're wastin' your. . . . . .fuckin' time and this is goddamn fuckin' bullshit. Bullshit? Bullshit, huh? This punk, Anzor Yugorsky? He described the gun to me in vivid detail. Makes mention it's as snubnose with a serious shine to it. The fuck is the guy talkin' about, Joey? He's talkin' about a fuckin' shiny gun. Big fuckin' deal, there's a thousand of them on the street. -lt ain't the fuckin' piece. -Oh yeah? What were you doing at the hospital when they brought Yugorsky in? Huh? Sniffin' around emergency. You know what l figure? l figure you were there to pull a switch on the slug they took out of him. My wife asked me to go to the hospital. She was concerned. ln a neighborly way. She wanted me to go to see.. . All right, you know what? Enough bullshit. l expect to find a bag i at Down Neck Station by midnight. lf the bag's not there one minute after. .. . . . l'm takin' you all down any fuckin' way l can. Even if l have to manufacture the case. And you know l will. 'Cause l got the toughest mob in the world. l'm the law. All right, stay put. l'm gonna grab you a burger. l'm not hungry. Yeah, but you didn't finish dinner so l'm gonna grab you somethin' to eat. Stay here. Dad? Don't go in there. Let's just go home. lt's gonna be all right. No, it's not. Hey, Frankie. How you doin?' Hey. How are ya? -lt's good to see you. -Sit, Joe. -How you doin,' guys? -Hi, Joey. Hey Joey, how you doin?' You want some coffee or somethin' to eat? Nah, l'm good. But listen l got my boy waiting out in the car. l want to get him a burger or somethin.' Tony, go and take care of that, hmm? Yeah, Tony, get him some fries and a strawberry shake. Don't scare him. He don't know you're comin.' So, Joe. l just got off the phone with lvan Yugorsky. . . . . . about this thing with his nephew. l told you, it's not the fuckin' piece. Look, everybody knows the nephew is a brain-fried reprobate. Yeah, whatever. He's a fuckin' tweaker piece of shit. And he's cookin' meth in his backyard. l know l told you this already but it's just a matter of time. . . . . .before he blows up the whole fuckin' neighborhood. We know this. But it's a sensitive issue with me, Joe. l'm in bed with Yugorsky on this gasoline deal. Hey, it's a good deal. -l don't want to rock the boat. -Oh, fuck that. Fuck those Russian cunts. Huh? pop, it's the fuckin' narc that's got his dick in our ass. Hey. Calm down, Tommy. You see, Joe, the tweaker's got it in. .. . . .his head that maybe you were lookin' to knock him. . . . . .out of the cookin' business and helped the boy out. Made a piece available to him. l would never use a kid to do something like that. Never. All right, all right, look. Look. l made a personal reassurance to Yugorsky that l will have my entire. .. . . .crew in the street out looking for that kid. Now, in the interest of professional harmony.. . . . .l think we all want to get our story straight. You agree, don't you Joe? Oleg. Oh shit! Hey kid. How you doin?' Your old man sent this stuff out for you. Thanks. Ain't it a little late for you to be out, huh? l have twins your age. They're in bed by now. What are you, like, nine? Ten. And a half. l gotta go to the bathroom. Hey Joey. Looks like your kid don't listen too well. Must run in the family. Hey Nicky. Get over here. Get over here.

Hey Nick. Where the Hell are you? l'm almost done. Well hurry up. Come on, we gotta go. and Razors. Come here, wash your hands. We gotta get outa here. Come on. All right, Nick, listen to me. l want you to think really hard. .. . . .about where your friend might be right now, because. . . . . .the others are lookin' for him and if they find him first- They won't find the gun. What did you say? Don't you mess with me, Nicky. l want you to fuckin' talk to me now. Just promise me you won't hurt him. Nick, l don't have time for this shit right now. Now fuckin' tell me. promise. promise you what? What, l promise. l swear to God! l'm not gonna fuckin' hurt your friend! Now just come on ! Just tell me! Just tell me what you know. Come on. This one here? No. Where is it, Nick? l thought you said you put it in there. l did. l put it right- Then where is it? l thought you said you put it in the tank. l put it in here! Oh shit. Which one did you put it in, Nick? Huh? Which one did you put it in? Goddamn it, Nicky. Why did you lie to me? Why did you lie to me?! l didn't. Why did you lie to me?! l'm not fucking lying! l put it in there! You just fuckin' kiiled me, Nick. You just fuckin' killed me! Come on. l want you to keep an eye open. lf you see anybody coming.. . . . .l want you to cough really loud all right? You're like a broken record. l'm tellin' ya you gotta see this thing. You better not be jerking my chain. What are you doin' here, kid? l was looking for the bathroom. See, even the kid thinks it's a shithole back here. Shut up, Ralphie. All right, listen.

Where the Hell are you? l'm takin' care of things. Well forget about it because they picked up. . . . . .Oleg at a bus station with some hooker. Who picked him up? The cops? Yeah. Jesus Christ, this is fuckin' bullshit. -Hey. - Fuck! Hey! You got Nicky with you? Yeah, he's right here. Then stop using your mouth around him ! And bring my son home! Now! Yeah. That's what l'm doin.' l'm bringing him home right now. Do you mind? l'm feelin' kind of parched. Big game Friday night. l bet you're excited about that, huh? lt's gonna be red ice and plenty of blue shirt bodybags. Am l right? Look, l could help you, kid. You and your Mom, if need be. Now l could get that prick out of your life. Lock him up. l could do that, l'm a cop. All you have to do is tell me where you found the gun.. . . . .and where you stashed it. That's it.

He goes against his Uncle and tells big man. . . . . .Yugorsky he will pay off my debt. His Uncle refuses and tells him. .. . . .he will send others to kill me. Set example. So Anzor make me wife.
