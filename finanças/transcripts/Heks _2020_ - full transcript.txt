Oh, I don't know. Like sleeping for one. You are so uptight. One of us should be... I just wanted to surprise you before I go to South Africa. I've had this creepy old mask for so long... I won't do it again. You seriously scared the shit out of me. - I don't even know what I would do next time. - I'm sorry. Sorry. Okay. You are definitely not from here. Mm-hm. Mm. Technically, we both aren't. South Africans. Yes, I know. But I was raised here. So... True. Here's to my future grandchildren. Where do you even get it? From someone I owe a great deal. Let me see this. - There's no eyes. - Mm. You're supposed to wear it like this upside down. Like this. - Mm. - Hm. Looking at the world through a different perspective. Very nice. What are you doing still working here? It's called making a living. Yeah. We could make more money painting. Do you even know how difficult it is just to sell one piece? I'm not saying it would be easy. - Why don't you do it then? - Why don't you just try? I'm not the artist, you are. I had a middle seat. I told you to check in early. I sat next to a doctor. Gave him your number. Doctors aren't my type. He made the flight bearable. Why don't you give him your number then? Dilanne, there's something I need to get off my chest. Yeah? I'm going to stay in South Africa. For how long? I wanted you to grow up in the UK, but to me South Africa's always been home. How long? For good. You're seeing someone. - Who is that? - Who? Mom, it's convincing. You can stop it now. Stop it. Mom, this isn't funny. Stop it. Mom? Mom? Mom! Kelly! Mom! Mom! Please stop. Stop! Bandile! You know, the lodge will be yours one day. Dilanne. I'm here for you. Okay? Bandile. Um, they're finishing up with your stuff. They'll be down in a second. Thanks, Michelle. I'll... I'll take your bags up to your room. - Thanks. - Okay. She reminds me of that one actress, Amelia someone. Pretty. Yeah. So are you, babe. You're such a charmer. What? It's a fact. I mean, I'm the luckiest guy in the world. - Yeah? - Yeah. I'm not her, Dilanne. I know, Auntie. - Anathi, get us some Rooibos tea. - With milk? Mm-hm, on the side. And bring some honey. You were five when you drew that. You could draw for hours and hours. I used to paint on the walls, the kitchen, my room, bathroom... Mom never minded. I'm sure Kelly encouraged it. Yes, she did. Do you remember when she dressed you up in a small lion costume? - Yes, it scared the girls. - Mm-hm. I was furious but... In the end, we all had a good laugh. - Always full of jokes. - Yeah. Why did you bring her mask? Just wanted to find out who mom got it from. Hm. No idea. I'm unable to run and I just keep falling. Completely powerless. I'm having these nightmares ever since... Sounds like my reality. Mom said that she owed someone. - Maybe that person would know who... - Dilanne. Just don't know if they will ever find who did it. Don't. Nothing will bring her back. So thankful for you and this place, like I can actually escape to some good memories. Dilanne, I'm... I'm selling the lodge. It's struggling financially for the past few years. It's only a handful of people still working here. Kelly kept a couple of collectibles in the shed. I need you to go through them. I can't stall them for much longer. Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Jeez! I thought it would be a good idea to wake you up. I'm working. You haven't replied to my messages. I said I'm working. Okay. Kiss. Michelle, stop it! We should tell Dilanne. Not a word. Do you understand, Anathi? Anathi? I do. Good. Keep an eye on Dilanne. I will. Anything else, Lisa? Come in. - Oh, I can come by later. - No, no, no, don't be silly. I won't be long. Did you find some nice things you'd like to keep? Yeah, plenty of photos and books and stuff. Well, I'm glad. Do you know her? Him? This girl? No. Hm. Few years ago, when we were here, Mom asked me to paint this one of her. - It's lovely. - Yeah. Mom painted the others. She never even told me she painted. Kelly had many hidden talents, much like you, Dilanne. The people... I'm sure they're just random people she painted. Oh. What happened? Not sure. You should tell her. What? You know I can't. Yes, you can. Or, if you give me permission, then I... It'll hurt her more than you think. At least she'll know, and then, she can decide for her... - You think that's a good thing? - I do. Stick to your job. Here, you are an occupational therapist, nothing more. I want iced tea. Anathi, I said I want iced tea. Anathi? So people should just abandon their morals and do what they wanna do? Babe, it's just a story. Honestly, what's bothering you? - I saw her social media pages. - And? And you guys were more than just friends, Bandile. Jeez, babe, come on. Make sure you put the brakes down on my wheelchair. What? I don't pay you to injure me. It's beautiful. Yeah. No wonder why Mom painted them. Now, you think you know a person... Just all along keeping secrets. Dilanne, I... Lisa's calling. Dilanne. There are a few people coming over for Lisa's birthday dinner. That's good. Thanks, Anathi. You should check the buzzer every time. You know I can't move my fingers. Quite sure I did. Every time. There's only so many times I can remind you. And the wheelchair brakes? I explicitly told you to keep them locked. But I did. Pay attention to what you're doing. What's Dilanne up to? She's in the shed. You and Mom were good friends. I thought you might know them. I remember the news, but they were all kept anonymous. Uh, except your brother. Those murders have nothing in common. But maybe they were all killed by the same person. Maybe Mom was on to something. John. Did he say anything to you, or, like, try to hurt you? No... I don't know. Well, there was nothing there when I searched it. Oh, well, they must have left. Dilanne, are you sure you saw them? Yes! I know what I saw, okay? He was just standing there, staring at me, and she was behind the curtain. They were right there. They were right in front of me. I did see them. I'm sorry. You're literally the only one who listens to me. You're like family to me. I'm worried about you. Go comfort your ex-girlfriend. She's not my ex-girlfriend. Okay? Dilanne is basically... How should I feel about you cuddling another woman? Michelle, her mum just passed away. Am I not supposed to? Do not guilt trip me, okay? And I'm not looking for some stupid mask maker, either. I already told her that there's too many people that it could be. - So how about I come over tonight and we can talk... - No. I don't want to see you tonight, or tomorrow night or the night after. You're being childish. Go to hell. Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I didn't mean it. Just leave. - Babe... - Go. Hey. How you feeling? Hm, fine. She needs to rest. Tertius. Dilanne, it's been a while. Did you know him? No. Husband died before I was born. Your mother gave it to me as a gift. I'm worried about Lisa. Yeah, she never remarried after Ben's death. And losing the twins straight after the accident... I think it's best we give her a little bit of space, you know? Yeah. I hardly recognized you. And me you. I'm... I'm really sorry about Kelly. Thank you. When did you move back? This year. Oh. Anathi doesn't want Lisa to know about this. Tertius didn't seem happy about something. Mm, nothing serious. Medical terms we weren't agreeing on. Sounded like he was quite upset. No, he wasn't. That leads to a very strange woman. What do you mean? Not all of them are but this one is. - For making masks? - She's a Witch doctor. Dilanne, if you are ill, I can help you... I'm fine. Thank you. So, just to be clear, you're going there to find out about the masks, nothing medically? - Right. - Then I'll come with you. No. It's just really something I wanna do on my own, you know? Her appearance is horrific to say the least. And her aura affects people in a way that they don't freak out. I can handle it. Okay. Just be careful. All right? - Tertius. - Yes? It's really good to see you. You, too, Dilanne. Hello? No, thanks. Do you know her? And them? Did my mum get this mask from you? Long time ago... ...I capture evil. Evil release in death. Okay, I think I should go. Let go off me! Burn it all! Burn it all! Burn it all! Get out of my head! Get out of my head! Get out of my head! I help. You took my mother away from me! I capture evil. Evil release in death. Why did you do it? I help. What, by killing her? You didn't kill her. Just make the nightmares go away. Burn it all. Burn it all. Burn it all. Burn it all. Burn it all. Who? Who killed them? She... Mother... Burn it all. Burn it all. Burn it all. Burn it all. Burn it all. I capture evil. Evil release in death. So my mum was a psychopath. She killed all those people. Your husband. How could you not tell me? I knew it would break your heart. You had no right to keep it from me. The Kelly you knew was nothing like that. She had no control over it. The witch doctor said that she took her darkness away. To be released in death. I believe it was you... It was you who changed her. Not some superstitious belief. She told me she got rid of everything. I never wanted you to find out about your mother. Anathi... You'll be all right. I'll find another occupational therapist. You have a month's notice. - It was me who... - No, not another word. - Lisa, please. - You will respect my decision. Anathi. I'm scared of her power. The witch doctor's. My grandma used to tell me stories about her black magic. She had a different surreal energy. I think she wants to help. I've been feeling something sinister. And I have no control. I felt it too. Ever since my mom was murdered. That's when it started? I can't wrap my head around it at all. There's so much I have to tell you. Ah, Dilanne... Look, I... I really wanna be here for you. Especially now. You have been. Yeah, but it's just our friendship and my relationship with Michelle, it's complicated. I mean she doesn't... I understand. Okay. Thank you, Bandile. You've been there for me when I need you the most. Happy birthday, Lisa. I was hoping to share a name with Robin. It can be quite expensive. Jesse can get so clingy with the kids. I can relate. Dilanne's like a daughter to me. When she was a child, I would be so harsh on anyone looking after her. Wait, stop. - This one? - Yeah, she was right there. Remember those calming pills I gave you? I know you said they could give me hallucinations, but I am telling you she was there. Dilanne... Well, they are hallucinations. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Um... We should get back to the party. Yeah. So my friend, to many more. Cheers! - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. I really like your tattoos. - Thanks. - Where did you get them? Ah, some in London, some in Thailand. When you going back home? Mm, next week. Um, sorry guys. You don't have to worry. It's just a party trick. It's a party trick. Here we go. All right. Excuse me. Excuse me. Just pass me the plate, please. You all right? Excuse me. - Here. - No. I got... I got this. Your niece seems to cope well under the circumstances. She does. She takes after Kelly. She's nothing like her. - I... - I said I got... Um, I'll get a dust pan and a brush. Thank you, Bandile. I wanna go. I'm tired. But what about dessert? Now. Okay, well... Please excuse myself and Lisa. Enjoy the rest of your dinner and dessert will be out soon. Happy birthday... Good night, Lisa. Leave them on. It's disgusting. You just cleared them all. How'd they get back? I... I have no idea. Still no reply from Michelle. Um, look, I'll see you. - Hello? - I'm sorry. I loved her. She was crazy fun. Kelly was as beautiful as you. All I ever wanted. When she told me that she killed my brother, I didn't believe her. Then she showed me the evidence. What's going on? I thought I could forgive her but I couldn't. I'm so sorry I had to see Kelly's death. I'm so sorry. She came back. This is what happens when Kelly's ghost touched me. Pain. Please help me. The pain. It was a little girl or a spirit or something. And it was very aggressive. It, like, came to me and it was screaming and... Hello? Hello? Shit! Bandile! Bandile, open! Come on. Oh, Bandile. Mom? Bandile. Shit! I'm so sorry. Dilanne, we need to get out of here. - I think Bandile's gone. He fell... - Gone? Please, you have to go help him. Please, go! Okay. Hey, we need to get out of here now. No, she said to burn it all. - Let's get out of here. - No. Trust me, okay? We have to do this. Quick, grab Mom's painting. Go! Tertius! Burn the painting. Tertius. Help him, please. We're not open yet. Surprise! This is where you wanna be. You want the fire lit? Do you want your electric wheelchair? It's just around the corner. No? You don't like the electric wheelchair? I should have stayed longer and helped with the transition. No. The new therapist is great. A man, which is okay. I like your office. Not for long. That's great. Yeah. You need to come visit. - To our new adventure. - Cheers. Rooibos tea? Coffee? I'll be right back. I don't wanna hurt people anymore. I capture evil. Evil release in death. Subtitles by explosiveskull
