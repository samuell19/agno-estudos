Subtitles by Caradecuica I will submit a report. We are all comrades, but the commander's order must be carried out. Do you miss the group? I don't even remember them anymore. And what does 13-20 mean, remember? 13-20... Identification number of Festival. To work! 13-74, 13-75? Spam, Ljuba. -We're right. -We pay taxes. 13-45? Paj. That's life. More... 13-46. Yes, Skif. -Friend. -Good reason to shoot. You could say, cousin! Same again. What does he have that I don't have? He's a bastard, but he's interesting in bed. Nice guys say you're just a bitch. So life with me didn't work out? Lisa. She's a real fox, don't put your finger in her mouth. What's bothering your happiness? Is this a memory test or do you need ghosts? Two days ago, a base that doesn't exist according to all documents... What are you waiting for? Make a wish. ...started sending signals through an open channel. We cannot decipher the signal. The United States will sooner or later discover the source. We're leaving! First of all, the transmitter signal must be switched off. I haven't seen anything stranger. What was produced here? Second task: to ensure the evacuation of the staff and handle the situation from a scientific point of view. Do we look like scientists? "A doctor will come with you as part of the group." If you have questions, ask them now. Are the correct codes written on these walls? There's someone there. One hundred percent guarantee against unwanted pregnancy. Hey, guys! If you're done... can we continue? We are going back to the beginning again. How many people did you find? FIVE YEARS EARLIER I didn't have time to count. Did you receive an evacuation order? It was before or after you find the hostages? -I've already talked about it before. -I'll repeat once more. I can repeat it a hundred times, but it won't change anything. When we finished cleaning, I found the hostages. I immediately inform the commander. Regardless, he ordered to vacate the facility. And what did you do? I made the decision to take the hostages out. I do not see the point of these questions. You know that better than I do. You already have taken your decision. No doubt, you saved several people. But this cannot be an excuse to not execute a direct order. There were people there! I had no time to convince him to change the decision. Your commander thinks otherwise. His report states... that you ignored the evacuation order, forcing him to change the whole plan in four minutes. Sure, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to get the people out of the danger zone. You are not competent for such decisions. Orders are discussed after execution. Did you know that your time on the facility was short? Yes. I assessed the situation and made my decision. You questioned the secrecy of the operation. And still, the lives of the members of your group! And the commander also said that too? On the battleship Mars, the request for clearing arrived at 14:38. At 14:45 the rocket was launched. 26 seconds later, you find the hostages and decide to take them out, despite the order. You came to the conclusion that the two minutes left until the destruction was enough for you? And you know that a rocket, once launched, cannot be returned. I knew I'd make it. Can you predict the future? What do you think? Does the commander have anything personal against you? Do I really have to answer that question? PARAGRAPH 78 He didn't accuse you, though. What are you talking about? He didn't say then that you reported him... for me. You have a sick imagination, that's a fact. Then why? Simply, just like that! That's what I thought. Did you manage to talk to her? There's nothing more to talk about. Correct! A man should be a wolf that attacks anything that moves. Do you ever think before to say something? He doesn't think, he knows everything anyway. Well, let's fly! Tic, tic, tic! Come here, little bird! Hey, where are you going? We are here! Doctor! -I'm going to kill you now! -Calm down, you'll do it later. -Are you colorblind? -I'm a doctor. Why did you do that? Paragraph 77 of the Statute. Quarantine 24 hours. For what reason? -Something happened here, and... -We don't know that! It is my duty to make sure everything is OK. Until then, I have no right to allow a return. It is my duty to make sure everything is OK. And how do we get out of here now? We're staying. Another day, until the helicopter returns. Bull shit! I want to get out of here now! Unfortunately, that won't be possible. Why? Because I need to recheck everything again. It takes me a few hours to do that. All right, we're not wasting time. Let's go back. Come on. I'm not going up those stairs again. It's nice here. And you really like it. Let's go. Any volunteer? Come on, Ljuba, show everyone how strong you are. -Why, he can't do it alone? -It's awkward. I'm not afraid of stings, if is necessary, I'll do it. Here, Klizmo, do it. Just keep in mind, I can't stand the pain. Will you stab or not? You're free... hero. You are really a master. Too bad I didn't meet you earlier. I didn't feel anything. This is a standard test. The result will be over soon. Can his Ukrainian blood be trusted? There is no nationality in the blood. So, if Ljuba has it, we all have? That's obvious. You got an antidote. Don't be afraid. Then what happened to them? Damage to brain cells responsible for acquired memory. Only instincts remain. To eat, drink, fight for survival. Every moving object becomes a threat, every object that can be taken, food. Man turns into an animal. The virus destroys the central nervous system and the patient dies. Because it deprives the possibility of movement and orientation in space. And what was that? An unsuccessful experiment? Why? He is successful, that's what we wanted. It is an ideal virological war, the enemy destroys himself. Why you didn't say that right away? You didn't need to know that. And what has changed now? I'll be done soon. Let me know any changes in your condition. We won't interfere with your work. Good luck... with your germs. It's a virus. Virus! Goodwin... And why are you called Goodwin? Because I'm a wizard. Why did you bring us back? I'll say it when I'm sure. Itâ€™s a shame that miracles don't happen in reality, right? Now can you tell? It is possible that the virus has mutated. Maybe someone changed the growth algorithm. I do not know. That means the old antidote no longer works. We are dealing with a completely new structure. What can we do? Come with me. The local doctor found the formula for a new antidote. Did you pay attention to his hand? Yes, he looked like a drug addict psychopath. The doctor tested the formula on himself. He made a formula, but failed to synthesize an antidote. Because one of its most important components is missing. Methionine! A simple amino acid. Absurdity. The device is programmed and ready for operation. Just add methionine. In any form and in any quantity, in the synthesis chamber, the antidote will be ready in an hour. Don't you happen to have immune any boosters or multivitamins? There are only bandages and BAS in the medications... BAS? Combat anesthetic. A powerful thing. I understand. No pills with instructions? I don't know how to tell them. I'll tell them. I will do my best to be convincing. Please leave me the medications. Want to enjoy? Don't go to the maximum, you won't come back. How much do we have left? What are you talking about? The numbers on the ampoules here are the same as on doctors. So they're not coming for us too? And you want to be better than others? You can report me again. I had a good reason. So, I went crazy because of her. Is that why you took her with you? If you die, others don't have to be with you, so you don't get bored. When I saw her hugging you, then I died. I'm already dead. Do you understand? And what? Was it easier for you? Very much. Do you love her so much? If you wanted to curse me, you could just call. Call... And where would I call you? When you needed me, you found me right away. You know, it's not that I love her. The thing is, she doesn't love me. Do you like the way she cooks? Are you crazy? It is better to put anything in the microwave. Too bad it doesn't matter anymore. The doctor is working and will do everything possible. Do you understand? We broke into the bar. How about you? What are we celebrating? When there's a drink, there's a reason. Give me a cigarette. Protective agent for respiratory organs, eyes and facial skin, protects against 25 chemically hazardous substances, including combustion products. The Phoenix hood does not burn even at 800 degrees and protects for at least 20 minutes. Are you OK? I left two years ago. Maybe we shouldn't start again? Hey, Doc! We've already issued a warrant. How are you feeling? I feel like my ass. -Does that count? -You look like her. So, everything is fine. Has your wish come true? Almost. That's almost good. What's the news? We are all infected. There's nothing I can do about it. I suggest to the group commander to move on to the next stage. Wait... I'd like to ask for a little more information. Usual procedure. Paragraph 78 of the Statute. If the cause of the damage cannot be removed and return is a possible danger, the group is subject to self-liquidation. What did he say? He's kidding! Are you kidding, Goodwin? There is nothing that can be done? Only on land. In the meantime, they would infect others. -The statute strict forbids... -Damn the statute! -We'll leave with the helicopter! -I'm in. We won't take the helicopter. We have twelve hours left, at most. No way! You did this, you get us out of here! Let's look at it differently. We have an advantage over other people. Interesting, what kind? We know exactly when we're going to die. Doctor! Hold him! Hey! Why? Why? And the doctors... are afraid... of pain. Hey, where are you going? Where are you going, coward! Breathe, breathe! I'll make you... Even if it comes to life, it doesn't change anything. I'm getting out of here! I'm going out! Hell, they have to pick us up! You haven't figured it out yet? Soon we'll go on all fours, swing, and nobody cares. If not us, they will destroy the base themselves along with microbes, rockets and us. Then we have to get them to pick us up from here. Lisa, can you make a connection? -Why? -Why? Say we'll return the missile guidance chips. If they don't save us, we will choose the targets ourselves! Die with music! Spam, you're a genius, I'm with you! -It's not worth anything, guys. -Why? Because I won't let you do that. Then we'll finish you. What do you think, if you shoot me in the head, will someone else shoot yours? Others are not needed here. Let her go! Now! Don't yell at him! Come on, Ljuba, start! We will continue! Shut up! -Why? -Shut up! -Why? -Want to know? -Put the pipe down, Paj. -Let him go. -Not a solution. -Put the pipe away! I'll shoot, Spam! Put the pipe away, he's my friend! -Put it down! -Spam, don't touch her! Put it down, I'm telling you! -Put the pipe away! -I'm shooting at three! Come on! -Shut up! -Put the gun away! -I'll shoot! -Put it away! Skif! Who are you with? -Skif... you make history. -So? The doctor told the truth. I look at you and I see... the virus is working. Are you crazy? Because you aimed at me! Spam, what are we going to do now? What to do, you don't know? Take the circular defense and return fire! -Hit back to whom? -Ourselves! It is an honor for a soldier to die with a weapon in his hand. She's aiming at me while I'm listening to you! Very well, just don't hit me. Where are you going? I'm not done yet! -Everything is already planned. -In what sense? We'll hunt by lot. Like on survival exercises. We help each other at the same time. We are comrades after all! Come on, let's decide! I am for. I'm for it too. Well... is that a way out? Let's shoot each other right now, why bother? What do you think? Raise your hand, what else to think? I want something to eat. I found pineapple. In slices. Check the expiration date. -Are you afraid of poisoning? -No. Shouldn't I be thinking about something else? Does anyone feel anything? What? Well, if something will happen to us, I guess we need to feel something? Maybe the doctor was wrong? What the hell paragraph! According to the papers, we are civilians. They don't care, if civilians or soldiers. Relax, everything is already settled for us. As for this pork. Does anyone want pork? In my opinion, everything is fine. I always knew that this is exactly how I should die. By the way, suicide is a sin. And who said suicide? I'm helping you because we're friends. I will take sin upon my soul. Let, thank you. I'll manage without you. I will survive. -Looks like a joke. -Of course. Either life has become easier, or dying has become happier. If anyone asks about me, I'm dead. You didn't think we would die today, isn't it? Surprise! Enough with that. Whether you like it or not, according to the Statute... we must die today. You always find a hard argument. Welcome. Ljuba... Ljuba! Hey! Someone pinch him. Ljuba, get it! What? Nothing. Give me that. They are white death. On my personal top list, this joke immediately came out on top. Don't make me laugh. I was so fed up that I was going to shoot. That's how strength was built. She beat me so hard that my soul came out on my nose. Strength is not all. You need to know where to hit. You know that well, you beat right in the heart. It's 7:20. Good morning. Good night. I'm lying down at this time. OK. Let's set the rules. We work in pairs, inside the station. The last one is clean, according to tradition. Or entrust it to the machines? Better machine. Lisa... In eight hours. Round. Block. In eight hours, and we're standing. We're starting. Why me? You are the only woman. Four. Paj! Tell me, does the circumcised work differently? I didn't use any other. I'm ready. Shoot. Do you want me to just kill you? -I'm ready, and you're not yet. -It's not possible to be ready for that! A man dies in peace only when he no longer regrets anything. That's why I'm ready. And you haven't yet. So... shoot. No. -Oh come on! -No! I can't do that. I can not! I can't do that. As you wish. I wanted an easier way. Why? Why? That's not right! Sorry... for... forcing you. Stop walking like a squirrel on a wheel. The squirrel is running and I'm walking. Here, I'm a squirrel now. See? Squirrel! Are you registered like that, squirrel? Are you hurt? -Everything is right ends well. -It can't end well! Listen, you can't just come once. Really, what's the hurry? Life passes quickly. By the way, did anyone even notice when it was over? Pull another, pull it out! The sooner we leave, the sooner we'll be done. Festival. Devil's number. Go, go. You'll tell me how it ends later. Do you hold Lyuba's hand while you sleep? -Do you want to replace him? -All right, in short... They take the boy to the death penalty, blindfolded, as is the order. Suddenly, in the execution site, he asked to have his blindfold removed. They ask him: Why? And he says: we're going up the stairs, I can stumble and break my neck. All right, when I get back, I'll tell you everything. You better say where you want to go. To God or to the devil? I'm the Devil! Looking for a place to hide... You won't find it this time. I see you! You dragged us by the nose all the time. It's time for someone to catch you too. Do you agree? Basically, I have nothing against you. That's my character. Wait a second, I'll be right back... If you'll allow me, I'd call someone. That's none of your business anymore. Hello! Hi, Doll. Guess what! Of course, who else could be? Doll, what's the matter with you, I'm not gone. As usual, jobs. You know me... Yes. She wouldn't understand what was going on. In two words: She can't! Don't get mad, OK? In one... It was a trick, Doll, a magic trick. Can you hear me? Carry on! Where are you? Life is full of surprises, isn't it? There is nothing I can do. You caught me. Well... Shoot. Are you knockout in the first round? No no. What are you going to do? I do not know yet. Doll, I almost killed you! Goodwin! You're still here? Guess three times. You know what the president's son asked to his father before the nuclear war started? What did he ask? Dad, Dad, what's this red button for? People like you lift my spirits by their very existence. Shall I tell you more? Go ahead. Two bullets flying. One asks: Who are you flying to? Second says: In the cop. And I'm a bandit. Goodwin! What are you going to do, our life goals are very different! Well, you're bleeding! -So it's possible to kill you! -You can try it! Hello! Commander! Where are you? Where are you? I'm looking for... the little Red Riding Hood... Hello! I'm here, Grandma! Get up, let's continue! Who are you talking to? He's not getting up for you anymore. Are you just buzzing, or are you finally going to stab? We fired... to our hearts. Bullets are like money, it's nice to spend them. Are you looking for it? You said you couldn't aim at an old friend. I'll close my eyes. You know... I was never afraid of death. It's just, I didn't want to hang out with her. That's a good joke. I haven't heard him yet. I just... I... made it up. Is this the end? Yes. But that is not death yet. Now it is death. I told you. You know what? He didn't tell a single new joke the whole time. But I will miss the dark side of his character. You speak as if you have returned from a walk. What if I was in his place? You could at least turn your head, out of decency. What about your hand? -No need to worry! -And I don't worry. Get out! I can only play with you asshole! If you want, I'll teach you. Why didn't you teach me earlier? Then who would I win? What are you waiting for? I would take one, but it's your turn. Pull it out, siren, don't hesitate. Go on. Pull again? We are? It happens. Too bad, so often. Do it again. I have to admit... Do you have another boyfriend? I thought, when it was all over, I would go to the country, build a house. -Household, cow's milk, and the like. -You always liked to pull your tits! And I once turned the head of a cow. It was even good. Then she made dinner and lit candles. It was time to say goodbye. A whore. Don't take it to heart. Cow more, cow less... Would you come with me? I'm allergic to milk. OK... enough jokes. We are no longer children. What are you waiting for? After you. As you say. As you say. Damn it! I didn't think it hurt that much. Listen, I've been wanting to ask you for a long time... And you're really... you're not gay, are you? I just have a few friends. Then... Goodbye... Dude! No, goodbye is a bad word. You will come with me anyway. You're not going anywhere alone. Would get in trouble again. And who will get you out of it? Yes. Here, we'll take the dog with us. You hear me, Spam... Spam! There is no sadder story in the world than the story of Romeo and Juliet. Shut up! I see you're in the mood to fight. Come on, pull on. We won't? Okay, then I'll do it myself. He wants me today! Will you be third. No. I meant in a sense, if we were the only ones left, we could put an end to our complex relationship. I better get out. Come on, why are you standing? I'm going! So go. Come on, go. I have a practical motive. My friend loves you, it's already been proven. Why that? You're playing with me like a doll! Yes. We all play, but the roles are different. I'm trying to prove how beautiful I am, you think you're being honest, and he's a fool. Everyone is crazy in their own way. Science. Listen, let's go one last time, for the excitement. Go fuck yourself! Did you tell me that in Japanese? I want you. Come on. We've done it before! Think of something new. That makes children! Damn it! You don't want children! Didn't you forget to take the pills? I can't let myself be on the ground and show up another jerk like you! You know, I don't like violence. But sometimes it happens to me that I don't have time to wait. Stop. -Wait. -Stay away! -Wait. -Stay away! Wait, wait, wait... Stop! Do you know how to find out if your wife has died? You do not know! I didn't mean it that way! Wait! If she died, the sex is the same, but there are more dirty dishes! Stay away! Stay away! I'm just kidding... kidding. Animal! Skif! Skif! You could have said right away that you wanted a threesome! Let me go! Let me go, dog! A woman should get used to freedom, as well as poison, gradually. Animal! I'll kill you next time. It's not by the rules. After all, you are my friend. I'll kill you! METHIONINE Where were you? When? All this time. You never look in the eye. Take a look in my eyes once! Did you love someone? One whore. One has to go crazy with you. Now all this is pointless. It's a shame that everything happened for nothing. Although... maybe... ...and rightly so. That's how this story came about. And the meaning... the meaning is that... It is enough to remember... how many people can dislike each other. And it was possible to save them. Paj... Festival... Spam and Ljuba... That idiotic doctor with good intentions, an enema... And me, of course. Okay... but what to do? Now it is late. I had no one but you. Well, you all wear... Live happily. What's funny? Sorry. Something sentimental. It has nothing to do with you. What are you thinking about? I do not know. I want to say something important, but is all non sense. You haven't slept in a long time? I don't remember anymore. Just want to close my eyes a little. Sleep, I'll be here. I like the way you smell. You forgot I don't like perfumes. I like the way you smell. Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Did you wake up? How did you sleep? Where is she? Believe me... she's never laughed like that with me. Where is Lisa? You think I'd let a girl suffer? And while alive, she was a bitch. Guess what she would be like if she waited for what was to come? What a bastard you are. Bastard. And you thought I was a teddy bear? It's over, you bastard... pray! What are those words? Have you watched bad movies? And I can't even pray, you know that. It's all in vain, doesn't it? You are a man without style. Sleep all night in a suit. With a woman like that! And what, is it easier for you now? She didn't deserve it. Sorry. I thought you didn't care. All right, don't get mad. To me. To me. Me... Even after all you've done, we're still friends. But not anymore. You do not forgive. Too bad. Good... Come on! Just do something I can feel now. The last one is clean, according to tradition. How are you? I don't feel anything yet. Come on, get up... up, up, up! Hey. Will you get up alone or should I help you? Help yourself. Do you feel it now? Do you feel it? See how funny it turned out? Is she laughing too? Things are not always as they seem. It seems to me that I am always right. You know, I wanted to apologize to you for that report. What the hell! Everyone in your position would do the same. If you only knew how many times I imagined rescuing the hostages. That I am was hero. That she loves me. Uh, you're as heavy as a horse! I hated you because it was you, not me. That's how I wanted him to be with me... and when I got that, it turned out to be just... sex. If you really want to know, it wasn't just sex. It was very painful. You want to ask me, why did I get married? So ask. Come on, ask! Ask, I see you want to. What? Louder, louder, hard of hearing. Okay, if you don't, I'll tell myself. Marriage is what men pay for sex, and sex is what women pay for marriage. Although, getting married for sex is the same as buying a hive for a spoonful of honey. Do you agree? What are you hiding from me all the time? If you don't mind, I'd take a look. Sorry I deprived you of all that. But I'll try to make it right. Skif! Skif! Skif! Skif! Skif! Lisa... -Are you all right? -Everything, everything is fine. Where is he? He went back inside. He said: Congratulate me, I performed the first miracle in my life. Do you know what that means? With him, everything has a meaning. I'm already getting sick of you. What the hell! It's too late to change my habits. Lisa, he left me. He dumped me again! Stop! Stop! It's too late! There is nothing more you can do! Stop! Stop! So that's it. He rejected me. He dumped me again, bastard! It's over, it's over, calm down... They're there, Lisa. They are all there. And we are here. We need to live on. Ultimately, as long as it is. Will you be with me? Such simple words! You couldn't say them before? So you'll be with me? Do you see anyone else here? Subtitles by Caradecuica
