Well... um, this city reminds me of... of Berlin after the war. When it was all in ruins and, um, I like that. DJ: Yeah. Um, so... do you want to tell us something about your experience with the Velvet Underground? No, I don't. I... I started making my own music um, after the experience with.... the Velvet Underground, in 1968 (sighs) and um... it was Jim Morrison's idea. He... he asked me to write down my dreams. - And... - Man: 1968. I mean, that was like almost 20 years ago! Yeah, that's-- that's right. Man: I mean, those must have been some of the best days of your life! Well, we-- we took a lot of LSD. That was... what we did. (engine revving) I'm-- I'm sorry about the interview, Nico. Uh, next time I'll make sure we get somebody that knows more about your career. Don't call me Nico. Call me by my real name, Christa. Yeah. You're Jewish, Richard? Er, yes, I am. Oh, I thought so. By the name. Do you have a problem with my being German? Richard: No, of course not. My father, he was a rebel. He helped a lot of Jews. The Nazis killed him before the end of the war.

(indistinct chatter) (EDM playing) Jane, set up a couple of beers. It's a nice club you have here. Yeah, well, it's going pretty well. But I don't like being a club owner, I like the idea of having my own artists to manage. Hi, it was a beautiful concert. What's your name? Maia. Maia. Thank you. Young people are boring. Yeah, but the world belongs to them. Do you really believe that? No. Well, you're-- Yours-- you're from Manchester. - Alex: Yeah. - Nico: Um... (sniffs) And Sylvia, you're Polish, right? No, I'm-- I'm not Polish. - Oh. - I'm not Polish, I'm Rumanian. - Nico: Ah. - So, you're okay doing all the driving, with... everything on the wrong side? Yeah, it's fine. A bit weird. Brilliant. Max: That's good stuff. Yeah, it's good stuff. Of course it's good stuff! You know, I-- I lost it and then I found it under my boot. Can you believe I walked on this for weeks!

Uh, well, he-- he-- he was with me. I mean, he spent the first four years with me and then he moved to his grandparents' in Paris. Um, his um... his father's parents are French. His father, you say, but he never recognized him. No, he didn't, but his mother did, as soon as she saw him. I mean, he's the exact copy of his father, so... (inhales sharply) Yeah um... She adopted him, and... took him away from me. I was too young and... and crazy to take care of him, so... Is he in music business too? No, he's um... - He is a photographer. - Oh.

It's a book of poems by Wordsworth. 1951 edition. I, uh found it in Paris. Oh. Uh, the first poem, The Prelude, is the one that you got the name of your first album from. Oh...

Yeah. (bottles clanking) - (Refrigerator door thuds) - Oh, wonderful! Wonderful. (Nico gulping) Mm... You know, I suffered hunger as a child, during the Berlin blockade. Then later I started modeling and I had to be always - on a diet. - (Domenico chuckles) It was terrible. I love eating so much. Nico... you made a big mess tonight. Ah, well, he got me a band of amateur junkies. Domenico: Hm. They are all amateurs except for the violinist. She's good. Why don't you replace them? No, it's not easy to find people who want to play with me. Good people, I mean. (cutlery clanking) I don't care. I really don't care about music anymore. I don't believe it. It's true! You know, I've been on the top, I've been on the bottom. Both places are empty. "My Heart is Empty," your best song for me. Yeah. I miss my son so much. I never see him. I was too young to take care of a kid by myself. I screwed up. Yeah. - What's this? - What? The yellow bottle. - This one? - Hm. No, nothing. Can I have some? No. It's-- it's um... it's Limoncello. Liquor, it doesn't go with pasta, it's shit and it's sweet. The bottle is too precious. - No. - Yes, it is. Ma no, Ma no, a friend of mine made it. And... It's been there for a long time. It's an old bottle. I don't even know how it is. But... - If you want... - Yeah. Mm... delicious! Thank you for this wonderful meal. You're welcome. Francesco: This is one of the best hotels of the area. I see. The view is nice. Francesco: Hm. Nico is a star, Richard. This is, uh, the least I can do. What she did yesterday was bad. Ah, Richard, was-- was very bad. The city doesn't want to pay the hotel. But... the hotel manager... will let her stay here for free. For free? Well, I-- I only sang three songs with them. The rest of the time I was-- I was playing the tambourine in the background. I did the same thing when I was a model. I... I was there for my image. Look... My life started after the experience with The Velvet Underground, when I started making my own music. I'd rather we talked about the present and... about-- about the songs I am singing now, about the... the record I am on tour with. Giulio Barozzi, nice to meet you. All right. Well? Me and a few friends from here, we have a jazz band of local musicians. We've been having a pretty good success locally. - I am the piano player. - Yeah, he's a great artist. And, uh, me and my boys, we would be honored if Nico were willing to play for our guests. Have you any idea of the type of music she plays? Not really, but it's the same. That lady is a piece of history. I heard you were in politics before buying that club. Is that true? I was a member of the Labor Party. I am actually a socialist. Nico: That's ridiculous! You don't have socialists in England. Yeah, we do. My whole family was socialist. I could have pursued a political career, but... not really my thing. So you're a lawyer? No, no I studied political philosophy. Oh, but do you think you can you help me get my son out of that hospital? (sighs) Um... Well, last time he came out he swallowed five grams of opium. It's a miracle he survived. I think he needs to be cured. (Nico sighs) Am I ugly? (scoffs) Yeah, really. Good. I wasn't happy when I was beautiful. Well, you can-- you can stay, if it doesn't upset you. Yeah. (clears throat) Yeah, yeah. All right. (piano playing) (indistinct chatter) (Laura) Oh, sorry. Well... we're ready. (hissing) Nico: Lisa... I drank a very good liquor... at Domenico's house. Do you think you could get a bottle of that before leaving the country? Um... yeah. Good.

Laura, good to meet you. - Man: Good to meet you. - Milos: Milos. Milos. Milos. - Man: Nice to meet you. - Laura: Laura! - Uh, this is my staff. - Hi, hello. And I brought a good friend of mine, Vladimir. He wanted to meet Nico. Uh, he doesn't speak English, he speaks French. He's a very famous artist in Czechoslovakia, Uh, he's well-known for his poems and songs and... (humming song) Milos: This is his most famous song. It's beautiful. Yeah, all right. So... Before we, you know, get into all... Can you get your hands on any of the-- the... you know the uh, the white stuff? You know China white? Skag? What? Nico: Heroin. We need heroin. We couldn't bring it in because of the border. I can't. I take enough risks organizing the concert. Richard: What do you mean, take risks? I obtained authorization to do an art show with the attendance of an unspecified guest. The identity of this guest, Nico, has not been revealed to the local authorities. This is why your concert is illegal. Richard: Uh, I don't understand. We handed in a letter at the border stating that we were playing here in Prague. Milos: I know but the problem is the local authorities. They always find excuse to stop concerts. It's better if they don't know where it is, huh? But how will the people know where it is? How will they know - that Nico is playing? - They will know. Nico: Somebody stole my passport and my money. Who was it? Have you checked your bag? I've checked my bag, yes. It must have been one of them. Them, Christa? Who's them? Yeah, you don't believe me, huh? So, you-- you... you don't even know who they are! So, You-- You-- You're defending them because you are-- They're fucking communists, like you! (speaking in French) I'm so sorry. Okay. (indistinct chatter) (indistinct chatter continues) (woman speaking in French) What the fuck is going on? What is he doing? (woman speaking in French) What are these voices, what are they saying?

Well, I don't need everybody to like me, I don't care. (man scoffs) Is it true that you travel around with a portable sound-recorder? Um... I mean, are you looking for something specific? Yeah. I'm looking for a sound I heard when I was a kid. Not that sound in particular, but, you know, the quality of it. Um... it was, um, the wind carried it. And it was the sound of... Berlin being bombed, of the war ending, of the city burning. It was, um... it was a sound that wasn't really a sound. It was, um, many things at the same time. It was, um... it was the sound of defeat. I have to confess you something. That story about my father being in the German Resistance. It's not true, I made it up. He died in the war as a soldier, like everybody else. I'm sorry I lied to you. That doesn't matter. I liked these poems. Even The Prelude. I don't-- I don't remember reading it before. But you're right. The title of The Marble Index it-- it comes from there. I must have been too high back then. Well, of course, yeah. There's this verse I really like. I mean, I... I didn't really understand it, but... it's written for me. It's about becoming old. - Can you read it out loud? - Yeah. (clears throat) "Though nothing can bring back the hour of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower. We will grieve not, rather find strength in what remains behind." I don't get it. Richard: Well, what don't you get? I mean, why does it say: "remains behind"? What's left should be in front of us and not behind us. Oh, no, "remains behind" means it has been left behind for us. But who left it? Richard: (chuckles) Well, I don't know. - Who? - Richard: It's not important. Oh. Christa... I'm in love with you. I'm getting married. You are? With Daniels, the landlord. He wanted to sell the apartment, but he didn't want to kick me out, so... Oh I get it! It's a joke, right? No, it's true. As soon as I come back from Ibiza, in September. I want to stop playing music and work in his flower shop. I like flowers. You don't like flowers. Where is Laura? I haven't seen her for a long time. It's the first time you got her name right.
