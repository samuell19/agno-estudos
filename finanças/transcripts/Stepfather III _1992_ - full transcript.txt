I know I'm not an easy man to find. Pretty soon, you'll be impossible to find. (coughing) Yes, yes, good, good. This is the right amount. (laughing) I'm sure you can understand that I don't like to bill insurance companies. (chuckling) Shall we begin? Come on, come on. Well, come on. (distant boat horn blowing) Don't worry, I washed them earlier. (jacket unzipping) This is going to take a few hours and there's going to be, well, a lot of pain. I've got everything I need, but I'm a little short on anesthetic. Take it easy. Let go of me. Look, I'm the best there is. You're gonna look like a new man, different, but quite normal. Now, I need you to be as absolutely still as possible. (suspenseful orchestral music rising) (car approaching) (coughing) You know, this ain't no damn hotel I'm running here. It was never a part of our deal for you to stay here until you're completely healed. I mean, this ain't no damn room service, and-- (dramatic orchestral music) (soda slurping) (rain falling) (distant boat horn blowing) (dramatic orchestral music) You ready to take a look? So, it turned out better than I thought. Damn Medical Association can go to hell.

(kids yelling) ♪ Cinderella ♪ Dressed in yellow ♪ Went up (crying) (church bell ringing) (kids screaming) - Where do you want these, father? - Oh, right over there, Mr. Thompson. - I don't know how I got tricked into this. - Come on, Keith. Playing the Easter bunny is good for the soul. - [Keith] Is sweating to death good for the soul too? (chuckling) - What are you complaining about? I gave you the day off so you could do this. Supposed to be busting your butt for me. Remember? - I only hope they aren't disappointed. - Now, relax, Keith. Nobody's gonna be disappointed. - I wanna see you at seven in the morning. We got a dozen palm trees to plant at the bank tomorrow. - I'll be there. - Sober too. - Mr. Thompson, I told you. I do not drink. - Yeah yeah. Father, if you don't mind, can I get your John Hancock right there? - Thank you for lending Keith to us for the day. - Give 'em hell, Keithy. Sorry, Father. - He means well, I think. (door opening) There we go. Now comes the easier part. (door closing) You just hop from kid to kid and pass out the candy. - I hop too? - All right, nevermind. Hopping is optional. Come on, come on, let's go. (light orchestral music) - Oh, happy Easter. Here you go. - [Kid] Thank you. - There's one for you. Hi. Here you go, slugger. Happy Easter. Ha-- (laughing) - Say thank you, Andy. - Thanks. - Happy Easter. - Your ear is bent. - Andy. - Oh, I'm afraid he's right. - May I help you with that? - On behalf of all the Easter bunnies in the world, I thank you. (laughing) I'm Keith Grant and I'm afraid it's a lost cause. - I'm Christine Davis and I think you look adorable. (laughing) (light jazz music) (laughing) - That's nice, real nice. You're a good dancer. - [Kid] Come on, over here. (laughing) (kids yelling) - Stabbing, strangulation, or poison? - What about poison? - Okay, I think it was stabbing with a butcher knife. Who do you think it was? The butler, the gardener, or the chauffeur? - [Father] The butler. - Okay, I think it's the gardener. - Couldn't be. (chuckling) - Well, I'll just run it tonight and see Compu-tective says. - [Father] Fine. - Remember, the loser buys the winner a double-dip at Frosty's. (laughing) - Go on, ask him. - What? (laughing) How can I just walk over there? - Try one foot in front of the other. - Ugh. - Christine Davis, when was the last time that someone nice and attractive and of a male persuasion showed up in this town. - About three months ago when Mark moved into this town and we all know what a great big flop that was. I don't exactly have a great track record when it comes to men. - But that's over. You better strike while the hormones are hot. (laughing) - Cut it out. - Listen, I saw the way you two were looking at each other this afternoon. - We didn't look at each other any way. Do you think he's married? - Well, I think you better find out. And if he's not, remember rabbits are supposed to be very fertile. (laughing) - Oh, Bernice, you.

Married? - No, not yet, but so-- - Mind if I cut in here? - [Keith] No. - Sorry I'm late. - Hello, Mark. - Come on, Christine. I said I was sorry. I had to work late.

I thought we were just having dinner. - We are just having dinner. Now, don't you start teasing me. How do I look? - Great, mom. You just look great. - Pot roast, I forgot to season the pot roast. - You seasoned it 10 times already. (doorbell ringing) Any long and he's gonna go away. - Andy, don't be so helpful. Okay. (light orchestral music) Hi. - [Keith] Hi. - You found us. - I sure did. It's the prettiest house on the block. (laughing) - I thought you said before you sold real estate. - Boy, he's got a mind like a steel trap. Well, I did that too and I was pretty good at it. - [Christine] Now, where was this? - In Charleston. - [Christine] Mmm. - Is that in South Carolina? - That's right. Anyway, I needed a break from the rat race and I've always enjoyed working with my hands, you know, building and growing and Mr. Thompson was kind enough to give me a job where I also get plenty of fresh air and sunshine, so I'm really happy here. Deer View is a wonderful place. - If you like cemeteries. - Andy. - [Andy] Well. - Well, what? - Well, this place is so dull. I mean, when I grow up, I wanna move to like Chicago or New York or-- - Andy, Andy, the people in big cities are not nearly as nice as they are here. Like you folks, inviting me to a home-cooked meal. - Well, I suppose we've never had a bunny rabbit for dinner before. (laughing) - I used to do these when I was a kid. Did you ever put one of 'em together, Andy? - Well, I'm not into models much. Computer sleuthing, that's my specialty. - What do you mean? Like Sherlock Holmes or Agatha Christie? - Well, kind of. I have a program that gives you different clues. You have to figure out who the murderer is, how they did it, and what the motive was. - Sounds fascinating. Maybe you can show me how it works sometime. - Sure. (ominous orchestral music) - [Kid] Over here. - [Friend] Okay. - [Keith] Hi. - Well, hi. Well, this is a nice surprise. - I hope I'm not intruding, but-- - No. - I just wanted to thank you for a great dinner and a wonderful evening. - [Christine] Well, we enjoyed having you. - And we just got these in. I thought you might like 'em. - Thank you. - Well, that Andy's quite a boy. Sharp as a tack. - Well, sometimes he can be a little too smart. - Miss Davis. - Just a minute, Tiffany. - Miss Davis, please. - I'll be right with you, Tiffany. - Miss Davis, but I gotta pee right now. - Oh, thank you for telling me that, Tiffany. Well, I guess I better go. My public's calling. (groaning) - I can see you have your hands full. Anyway, thanks again. - Well, sure. Keith? Do you like picnics? - Sure do. Sunday's my day off. - Great. I'll see you about noon? - I look forward to it. (ominous orchestral music) - Christine, we need to talk. - Mark, now is not a good time. Tiffany has just-- - You had time to talk to that gardener. - He's not a gardener. And besides we don't have anything to talk about. - I think we do. - Shhh. - [Mark] We have been seeing each other for the last three months and now you start dating someone else? - Mark, we broke up two weeks ago. It wasn't working. - Well, it was working for me. I thought we had a future together. I tried hard to be a good stepfather to Andy. - Well, you tried too hard. Mark, we've been through all this before. It just didn't work out for me and Andy. - We could be the perfect family. - Mark, please, just let go. - [Mark] Christine. - Don't. - I love you. - It's over. (ominous orchestral music) (dog barking) Well, he's happier than I've seen him in a long time. - He's a terrific kid. That model's not much of a challenge for him. He's almost done with it. (laughing) - And I'm happier than I've been in a long time. - Well, you deserve to be. (light orchestral music) How did Andy end up in a wheelchair? - Well, when Andy's father and I got divorced a couple years ago, Steve had Andy every other weekend, and one weekend when he came to pick up Andy, we got into an argument over, you know, God knows what and Andy got upset, started to cry and he ran out of the house and into the street. Never saw the car. - I'm so sorry. - It's a lot to handle. I mean, it's really overwhelming for him. - Well, he sure does seem to handle his handicap well. - Yes, he does. But that isn't the whole story. You know, he was in the hospital for many months of therapy. At least a dozen doctors examined him. Keith, they all said the same thing, that he should be able to walk, that physically he can. But they don't know. They think it's psychosomatic or something. - Then we can never give up hope that he'll recover some day soon. Maybe I can help. (ominous orchestral music) - We had a wonderful time. Andy, did you thank Keith for a great day? - Thanks. (laughing) - I had a great day too, slugger. Let's do it again real soon. (laughing) - I think I can guarantee it. Bye. - Bye. - Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. - That's all right. I didn't see you. Can I help you? - Maybe. I'm Mark Wraynal. We met at the Easter dance, remember? I live around here and you're new in town, aren't you? - Yes, I am. I'm Keith Grant. Will you excuse me? So, what can I do for you? - I just thought since we're gonna be neighbors, we outta be acquainted. Nice place you got here. A lot of fresh air, never gets too hot. Plenty of privacy. - I like it. - Did you buy or are you renting? - Mark, you're not here to discuss real estate, are you? - No, I guess not. Look, pal, I think it's time you and I had a man to man talk about a certain lady by the name of Christine. - What about her? - I think you should know that I've been seeing her for the last three months and I'm also very fond of her son, Andy. We're gonna be married. We're gonna be a family. I'm gonna be Andy's stepfather. - Well, she never mentioned any of this to me. Is she aware of all your plans? - Look, pal, I don't think that's any concern of yours. You just stay the hell away from Christine and Andy. Find your own family. - Well, Mark, I understand. After all, you were there first, weren't you? - Yeah, glad you see it my way. Well, look, pal, no hard feelings, huh? No offense. - None taken. (grunting) (intense orchestral music) (screaming) (bone cracking) (shovel thudding) I'm not your pal. (shovel thudding) (whistling) (ominous orchestral music) - The lord has told us that the greatest of all our human virtues is love, the love that exists between a man and a woman, the love of a mother for her child. And there is no greater joy in the eyes of the lord, (baby crying) than the family unit. It is a gift given to us by the almighty and it must be preserved. (light orchestral music) (video game beeping) - Hi. - So, Andy boy, who was our culprit, huh? Was it the murderous butler or the nasty chauffer or was it the gardener, huh? - Well, I haven't spent much time at my computer lately. - Why's that? I'm anxious to find out who the murderer is. - We spend a lot of time with Keith. - Well, you don't sound too happy about that. - Well, mom likes him. - How 'bout you? How do you feel? - Well, he means well. There's just something that bugs me about him. I mean, he's a real cornball, a real square. - Your mom seems to really like him and that's important. He seems like a nice enough fella. - Yeah, I know, but he just tries too hard. He's a real nerd. - Why don't you give him another chance? He might surprise you. Now, back to our case. Was it poison (imitating choking) or strangulation, huh? (laughing) (light orchestral music) (computer beeping) (keyboard clicking) (laughing) - It's time for bed, slugger. - I'm not finished yet. What are you doing here anyway? - Oh, I came to tuck you in. - Where's mom? - Up we go. - Hey, what are you doing? Put me down. - There you go. Did you brush your teeth yet? - I can do it. - Don't fight me, Andy. I'm here to help you. You should get used to it. - I can do it, you know? - I know, you're a big boy. Did you brush your teeth yet? - Yes, I did. - Good boy, good boy. Goodnight. Sleep tight. (ominous orchestral music) Don't let the bed bugs bite. (dramatic orchestral music) (light orchestral music) - Mom. - Andy. You should be asleep. - I need to know where the new printing paper is. - It's right under your desk, where it always is, honey. - Let me help you, tiger. - No, he can do it himself, Keith. All right, Sherlock, it's lights out for you right now. Goodnight, Andy. I don't know what's gotten into him. - Well, he's just not used to having a man around the house. All he needs is time, Christine. - I hope you're right. You know, I worry about him so much. You know, just last month, I found him trying to use his computer to access local police records on an unsolved murder for the last 20 years. Can you believe it? My son, the hacker. - Gotta be pretty smart to be a hacker. He's a good boy, Christine. (light orchestral music) - [Christine] I wish you could stay with me tonight. - I want to. I really want to, but I can't do that. - Why not? - Because I'm not the kind of guy to come into town and just take advantage of a single mother. I'm just not that way. - Oh, but I want to make love to you. (sighing) - Not until it's right. Not till we're a family. - Keith Grant, did you just ask me to marry you? - If I hear the right answer. - You are the most incredible man I have ever known. - Is that a yes? Will you marry me? (light orchestral music) - And do you, Christine Ann Davis, accept Keith Grant to be your husband, to love him and honor him, holding him above all others, in sickness and in health until death to you part? - I do. - Please take the marriage ring. (ominous orchestral music) Place it on Christine's finger and repeat after me. With this ring, I thee wed. - With this ring, I thee wed. - And now, by the power granted under me, by God and the state, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present, Mr. and Mrs. Keith Grant. (crowd applauding) (light orchestral music) - Thank you so much. Hey, hi, glad you could make it. Hi. - Champagne for you, sir. - Hey, Andy. Well, Father Brennan, that was a beautiful ceremony. Thank you. - Well, thank you. You know, it's always a pleasure, seeing two people so happy together. It's too bad your relatives and your friends couldn't make it. - Yeah, well, Louisville's a long way away and of such short notice. - Mmmm. - I thought you said you were from Charleston. - No, I grew up in Louisville. In fact, my family still lives there. I spent the last few years in Charleston, just before I moved here. - I have a very good friend in Charleston. I went to seminary with him. Father Driskell, do you know him? - No, I don't. Will you excuse me, Father. Christine sent me up here for some champagne and I'm not about to keep her waiting. Well, at least not on our wedding day. - Of course, we have plenty of time to talk later. - I told mom she should've waited. She hardly knows anything about him. - You know, Andy, I suggest that you keep your suspicions and your investigations to your computer games, hmmm? (dramatic orchestral music) (laughing) (group clapping and whistling) (computer beeping) (keyboard clicking) (light orchestral music) (computer beeping) (computer beeping) (waves crashing) (romantic orchestral music) (computer beeping) (keyboard clicking) (computer beeping) (keyboard clicking) (computer beeping) (keyboard clicking) (computer beeping) (keyboard clicking) - Don't you think it's about time to hit the hay? Brought you some hot milk. Isn't that what a babysitter's suppose to do? Oh. (laughing) Andy, what are you doing? - I want to find out about him. - Andy you're taking this too far. You can't do this. You can't pry into Keith's life. - Look, he tells you one thing and he tells us another. - It's not fair to Keith and it's not fair to your mother. Now what do you think you're gonna find out? - I wanna find out who my stepfather really is. (dramatic orchestral music) (waves crashing) (moaning) - Can you check these out for me? - No, I'll do no such thing, young man. Your imagination is getting out of hand. Now, you're going to bed right now. - Come on, Father. - No. - I can't make these long distance phone calls. My mom will kill me. Besides, who's gonna talk seriously to a kid? You've gotta help me. - No, absolutely not. This nonsense stops right here and now. (sighing) - In less than 10 phone calls, we can find out if he is from Charleston or Louisville or if he's lying to us for some reason. Come on, Father, you've just got to help me. - Well, I won't make any promises, but if you go to sleep right now, I'll think about it. - Deal. Yeah. (light orchestral music) Thanks. - Yeah, yeah. Goodnight. - Oh, and one last thing. - Hmmm, what now? - Did you find any cookies in the kitchen? - Oh, you, I told you, I told you that. (imitating choking) Get to sleep, now. (laughing) (grand orchestral music) - [Announcer] With Lauren Sutliffe, on location reporter for Crime Search USA. (TV powering off) - Hiya, son. How you doing? - Hey, that's my favorite TV show. - You shouldn't be watching programs like this. You should be outside playing, like other kids. - I don't wanna go outside. I wanna watch TV. - Andy, I've been you stepfather for two weeks now. I wanna start spending some more time together. Come on, I've got a great game for ya. - I don't wanna play any games. (ominous orchestral music) - Well, Andy, I've got a surprise for ya. - What are those scars behind your ears? - Oh, it's nothing. Just an accident when I was a kid. Look, what I got for ya, a genuine pro model. - Are you crazy? I can't play football. - Sure you can. All you gotta do is try. (sighing) Ready, Andy? Catch. (grunting) That's okay, Andy. You can do this. All you have to do is move your arms and your hands, okay? Every little boy can do this. - [Andy] I just can't. - No such word. Here it comes. (grunting) (ominous orchestral music) - Ow, my arm. I hurt my arm. Help me. - Andy, listen to me. Walk. Just get up off the ground and walk. - I can't. - Come on, Andy, do it. Your mom will be so proud of ya. - My arm hurts. - Come on, Andy. Come on. (grunting) That's it. You can do it. I know you can do it. Now, come on, you walk to me. (grunting) Andy, get up and walk to me now. - I can't. You're crazy. - Yes, you can. Now, you get right up. You get up. - I can't. Stop it! - Yes, you can! You just don't want to, do you? - No, I can't, I can't, I can't! (grunting) - Here and stop that damn whining. - And Beth has two kids right around Andy's age. We just moved into a big house with a huge backyard. It's a great neighborhood with lots of kids and there's a great school with an advanced program for gifted children. It's prefect for Andy. - We would love to have Andy for the summer. He'd be really comfortable. He gets along great with my kids. - I appreciate that Beth. I really do, but I want Andy to stay with us and I'm not so sure-- - [Steve] Look, Christine. Andy's mentioned a couple of times that he'd like to go to this advanced computer class at summer school. - [Christine] I know. - Well, it starts next week. And he also mentioned he'd like to spend some time with me and my new family, just on a trial basis. He can come back any time he wants to. Just give it a chance. - Chance for what? Andy's very happy here. This is a family. - Look, Keith, I'm sure you're a good man, but a boy needs his father and I am his father. Just give me a chance to take care of him, to be close to him for a while. - Look, Steve, I can't promise you anything, but we'll think it over. - I honestly don't see what there is to think over. Andy's very special to us and we certainly don't want him to leave, even for a summer. Just can't break up the family. This is a very happy home and you already have a family. - Just talk to Andy. Let him decide. Whatever he wants, that's fine with us. - I'll talk to him. - And I'll certainly stand by Andy's wishes, but you're going to be disappointed. (ominous orchestral music) Andy's home is with us. He wants to be here. - [Andy] I'm sure gonna miss you, mom. - You absolutely sure you wanna go. - You know I really wanna go to that special school. - Mm-hmm. - Take the computer course. I really like Beth's kids. - What about your dad? (ominous orchestral music) - Well, he really seems to wanna spend some time with me. I'd like that. - Well, I just want you to be happy, honey. - I can call you any time I want? - Oh, of course you can, sweetheart and we'll come up and see you a lot. - I don't see why we're even having this discussion. It sounds like you're encouraging him to go. I can't believe it. - Keith, I just want Andy to feel comfortable making up his own mind. - Well, what's there to make up your mind about? You like it here, don't you, slugger? With your mom and me? We go on picnics and I take you go-carting. I know you like that. We build these models together and we're gonna go camping and fishing this summer. Do you remember? - I don't wanna go fishing. - We can do other father, son stuff. Andy, we're a team, me and you. - [Christine] Keith, what are you-- - Christine! He needs to consider this very carefully. Andy, you're gonna be more than four hours away. That's very far. You're not gonna be able to see us as often as you think. You're gonna get homesick and you're gonna miss us a lot, your mom and me. - Keith, that's enough. (sighing) - And what if your daddy doesn't give you the attention that I do? And what if he's careless again and you get into another accident? What happens to you then? - Keith, that's enough! (ominous orchestral music) Stop it. What's gotten into you? - He's my daddy. He loves me. I wanna be with him. - This is your home. I am your daddy now. - He's my real daddy. I wanna be with him. (ominous orchestral music) - They won't listen! (ominous orchestral music) "He's my real daddy, I wanna be with him." Be with him? Well, how 'bout me, huh? How' bout me? Who am I here? Who am I here? Who? She told him he could go. She told him. She practically encouraged him to go. And now he's going, he's going, he's going. He's going! (dramatic orchestral music) - Mr. Grant. I'm Jennifer Ashley. I called about your cottage in the ad. - Oh. Nice to meet you. Please, call me Keith. Are you new in town? - Mm-hmm. We got here last week. We've been staying at the Deer View Inn while we've been looking for a home. Would you have time to show it to us now? - Yeah, sure. Just let me clear it with the boss. That's a fine-lookin' boy. - Oh, this is my son Nicky. Say hello to Keith, sweetheart. - Hi. - Hi, Nicky. Please. - Okay, thank you. - I'm gonna take my lunch break now and show my cottage to these nice folks. - You make sure you show it to her real good. You know what I mean, Keithy? (finger popping) (whistling) (light orchestral music) - I just love it. It's exactly what we're looking for. Fresh air, peace and quiet. And that flower bed is so incredible. You must really have a green thumb. - Well, I use a special fertilizer. - Why do you wanna give up this great place? - Well, I just moved into town, but I have five months left on my lease. Now, is it just you and the boy moving in? - Yes, just the two of us. My husband passed away last year. - Oh, I'm so sorry. You know, I don't mean to pry. - No, it's okay. We can't live in the past. - Quite right. - Yes. - Can we live here, mom? Can we? Please. - Can we? - The place is yours. - Well, ready to go. - He'll be fine. I promise. We'll take really good care of him. - I know you will. You be a good boy, Andy. - I'll call you as soon as I get there. - You and Keith come visit any time you want. - Yeah, we mean that. Don't be strangers. - Thank you. I'll see you in two weeks. (ominous orchestral music) - Okay, gang. Let's hit the trail. - [Kids] Yeah! - I love you, mom. I'll call you every day. - Me too. I love you very much, Andy. - [Steve] Here we go. - [Kids] Happy trails! Bye, bye! (horn honking) - [Andy] Bye, mom. (sniffling) (ominous orchestral music) (light orchestral music) - Yeah! - Bring it over here. You stay there. Ready? Hut one, hut two, hike! (laughing) - Yeah, yeah! - Let's go. You better run. (grunting) Hand off. (laughing) (grunting) (laughing) Gonna tickle you. (laughing) - [Father] Hello there. (ominous orchestral music) - Father Brennan. We were just talking about putting in some new yard with some flowers in it, when Andy, Nicky here, brought out the old pigskin. - [Father] Uh-huh. (laughing) - This is Father Brennan of St. Joseph's church. - Hi, Jennifer Ashley. Pleased to meet you. - [Father] How do you do? - This is my son, Nicky. - Hi there, young man. - [Nicky] Hi, Father. - You know, in my younger days. I caught a lot of great passes at Notre Dame. - Wow, you played for Notre Dame? - Sure did, young man. I'll give you some pointers later one. I just came out to say hello. I heard you were new in the neighborhood and I wanted to invite you and your son to mass on Sunday. - Oh, well, we'd love to. Thank you. - I, do-- - Would you like a cup of coffee and some freshly-baked muffins? - That sounds very nice. - I, uh, I better get back to work. Mr. Thompson's probably wondering where I am. We'll talk later about the plants, okay? You know, I've got some great ideas for the landscaping. Oh. (ominous orchestral music) Nice to see you, Father Brennan. - Good to see you, Keith. - And the laparoscopy confirmed that your blockage is in both of your fallopian tubes. Now, surgery is possible, but there is no guarantee you'll be able to get pregnant after that. - But this is a simple operation, isn't it? - Yes, but the percentages aren't in here favor because of the-- - What does this mean exactly? Can she have a baby or not? - In my opinion, it's out of the question. I'm sorry. Look, I understand if you'd like to get a second opinion. And there is always adoption. - Let's go. (ominous orchestral music) (laughing) - Watch out! (tires screeching) (horn honking) - You idiot! What's wrong with you? Didn't you see the stoplight, you moron? (horn honking) (ominous orchestral music) - All I want is a family! Daddy needs a family! It was perfect and then he had to leave. She encouraged it. She encourage him to go. Why don't they ever let me do it right? (grand orchestral music) - [Announcer] With Lauren Sutliffe, on location reporter for Crime Search. - Steve, dinner's ready. - [Announcer] USA. - [Girl] You can't catch me, you can't catch me. - At the top of our weekly crime search most wanted list is the family serial killer, so named because he seeks out and marries single mothers with one child and then inexplicably kills them in cold blood. - Andy, come on. - Authorities nation-wide were shocked when this man escaped a second time from this seemingly impregnable fortress. I'm standing outside the gates of the Puget Sound Institute For The Criminally Insane, where he brutally murdered a hospital administrator. - Andy, come on, son it's time to eat. - Just a second, dad. - And in this second shocking escape, just nine months ago, he savagely killed three more security guards. Police, nation-wide have absolutely no clues as to his whereabouts. Here's the most recent photograph of the family serial killer. If you see this man, contact your local authorities immediately. He's considered extremely dangerous. - [Steve] Andy, well come on. - Just a second, dad. - The family serial killer has a long list of aliases and even longer list of grieving families left in his wake, which makes this grizzly story even more chilling. This is Lauren Sutliffe, reporting on location for Crime Search USA. (grand orchestral music) (light orchestral music) - Gravy, honey? - Oh, no thanks. Boy, that new case on television. Wow, really weird. I gotta start a new file. - Wonder how the FBI ever got along without ya, Andy. (laughing) (romantic orchestral music) - Do you know how long it's been since I've been with a man like this? - How long? - Since before Nicky's father got sick. Almost two years. That's too long. - We better slow down. - Why, what's the matter? - Well, let's just go slow. It's more romantic. - Keith Grant, you're the most amazing man. I feel like I could be with you like this forever. (door creaking) - It's late. - Oh, thought you were asleep. - Yeah, I had to finish up some work at the nursery. - I called. There was no answer. - I let it ring. See, we never answer it after we close. - I made an appointment with Father Brennan. - What for? - To talk. You know, we've been married six weeks now and something's changed between us. - I don't see why we have to talk to Father Brennan. - It's important to me that you be there, Keith. He wants us to go to confession. (dramatic orchestral music) (shower running) (motor whirring) - I'll shovel, lover boy. - You okay? - Level it out. I know what's going on, you know? (ominous orchestral music) - What? - You and the babe you rented your house to. I know what's going on. - I don't know what you're talking about. - I was driving past your old place last night, coming home from the bar and guess what I saw, huh? - I don't know. What did you see? - Why, I saw my truck parked in her driveway. So, I says to myself, "Self, "what's my truck doing parked at the Fox's place "late at night, when it's supposed to be "in your driveway?" Now I'm getting real curious. So, I hop out of my car and I take a look through the window. And I take a real long look and guess what I saw, Keithy? You, rolling around on the floor with her, while your little wife was at home waiting for ya, mister I believe in the family bullshit. - No, no, you are completely wrong, Mr. Thompson. It's not what you think. You have no idea how important my family is to me. - You're full of crap. (rake thudding) (intense orchestral music) (screaming) - Silence is golden, Mr. Thompson. (screaming) (rake thudding) (choking) (phone ringing) Thompson's nursery. No, I'm sorry, he's not. Actually, he won't be back for quite a while. He had to go back east on family business. I'm Keith, the new manager. Sure, come on in. I'll be happy to show you what we've got. Bye bye. (phone hanging up) Well, business is picking up already. - And authorities have finally come up with their first solid lead on the escaped family serial killer. This is an update on the story we reported on last week's show. (light orchestral music) I'm standing in the actual room in which authorities believe the wanted killer had plastic surgery and then murdered the physician at least nine months ago. The victim has been identified as a discredited plastic surgeon, who had been arrested in two other states for operating a medical practice without a license. The police crime lab has positively matched fingerprints found here with those of the escaped family serial killer. I'm speaking with police pathologist, Dr. Laerson. What type of after effects would you see following plastic surgery? - In most cases, there are very subtle scars behind the ears, above the hairline, and in the facial creases. Ordinarily, these scars are visible for a year or more after surgery. - Thank you. However the fact that he most probably had plastic surgery, makes his capture all the more difficult. Again, here is the most recent photograph of the family serial killer. If you see this man, contact you local authorities immediately. He's considered extremely dangerous. (door opening) - Hi, dad. - Andy, you're supposed to be sound asleep, son. - [Lauren] Reporting live on location-- - Sorry, I got a new case to work on. - Of the family serial killer, this is Lauren Sutliffe for Crime Search USA. (TV clicking off) - Now will you go to bed? - This is an amazing case. - Yeah. (light orchestral music) Hope this kind of stuff doesn't give you nightmares. Now you think you can wait till morning to catch the bad guys? - Dad, we detectives never sleep. (laughing) - Sure is great having you here, son. In all that time we were apart, I really did miss you. - I missed you too, dad. - Sweet dream, buddy. (door closing) (ominous orchestral music) (sighing) - Bless me, Father, for I have signed. - And how long has it been since your last confession, my son? - A few months, Father. I have a few things to confess. I didn't report a cash purchase at my job just before my boss left on a long vacation. - And what else? - I parked my truck twice in a handicapped zone. - Is there anything in your personal life that you wish to discuss? - No, I'm a happy family man. - [Father] Tell me where you're from, my son. - St. Louis. - Have you ever been married before? (ominous orchestral music) - Of course not. - [Father] Have you ever been unfaithful to your wife? - Absolutely not. I don't understand this line of questioning, Father. I came to confess my sins, not to be interrogated. - Your penance is one act of contrition, five our fathers, and five hail Marys. Go in peace, my son. (window sliding) (sighing) (laughing) (light orchestral music) - Vroom, vroom. - He just loves that plane you got him. This is the happiest day he's had in a very long time. - Well, there's many more where that came from. He's a fine boy. - Keith? - Hmm? - Move in with us, me and Nicky. We'd be so happy together. - I don't think I could do that, Jennifer. - Why not may I ask? - Because I don't think it's right to live with a woman out of wedlock. - I'd make a terrific wife. I love you, Keith. Keith? - I'm flattered, but I'd need some time to think about it. - And you would be a terrific father. You and Nicky get along so great. - He's a wonderful boy. - Then say yes. - We'd have to move out of Deer View. - Why? We love it here? - I'd need a higher paying job to support you and Nicky. And anyway, I don't like working at that nursery with Mr. Thompson. I wanna get back to my old job in real estate. - Does that mean yes? - Not yet, Jenny. But if we're going to be a family, it's important to have a new beginning. (tires screeching) (ominous orchestral music) - Andy's back. He got homesick and wanted to be with us. Steve brought him back this afternoon. He's back, Keith. We're a family again. Just like you wanted. - That's great. It's gonna be great having Nicky home. - Nicky? Who's Nicky? - Wait a minute. Hold on here. I'm sorry. I was so excited to see him I forgot what I was thinking. Of course, I know it's Andy. Yeah, I'm gonna go chop some firewood. We're gonna have some marshmallows tomorrow night. Andy's back. (light orchestral music) - And in your homeroom, you'll have your own cubby and that's where all the boys and girls keep their jackets and their lunchboxes. Oh, and see all these drawings here on the wall, hmm? That's some of the work from the arts and crafts class. Would you like to have one of your drawings on the wall? - [Nicky] Yes. (ominous orchestral music) - [Christine] And you're a single mother? - Yes. - And your son's name is Nicholas. - Yes, we call him Nicky. - Nicky? - Yes. - Would you excuse me? - Of course. (ominous orchestral music) School will be great for Nicky. Finally he'll have some children to play with. There are no kids out where we are. - Where did you say you were living? - We rented a cute cottage out at the end of Harrelsburg Road. It's just a few miles out of Deer View. - I think I know that area. (light orchestral music) (computer beeping) (keyboard clicking) (computer beeping) (keyboard clicking) (computer beeping) (computer beeping) (keyboard clicking) (whistling) (keyboard clicking) (ominous orchestral music) (low rumbling) (door closing) (sighing) - [Father] Andy, this is the most preposterous thing I've ever seen. - Look, same weight, same height. - They don't look anything like each other. - He had plastic surgery. I saw the scars behind his ears. Here's the story on TV. Look, they found finger prints where he killed the plastic surgeon. If we can somehow get Keith's fingerprints. - Andy, now you're taking this too far and it's gotta stop right now. - Father Brennan, this is why I came home, to protect my mother. If I'm right... Did you check all those Keith Grants in Charleston and Louisville? - Mm-hmm, yes I did and they all still live there. - Wow, great. Why didn't you tell me? - And later on he told me that he was from St. Louis, hmm. - So, what about that? - Well, I suppose, if I don't help you with this, you'll probably do it by yourself. - That's right. - Well, if this is what it takes to prove your wrong, Andy boy, then I'll help. (light orchestral music) - Thanks. - You're not welcome. Now, let's see this. (ominous orchestral music) - You just go and invite him to dinner. You don't even ask me? - I thought you like Father Brennan. What is the big deal anyway? - Maybe I had other plans, like taking you and Andy out. - Well, you didn't say anything. We can go out tomorrow night if you'd like. Besides, I didn't invite Father Brennan for dinner. Andy did. They're friends, remember? (knife chopping) Do you know a woman named Jennifer Ashley? - No, why do you ask? - She enrolled her son at school today. Just moved into town. - Never heard of her. (light orchestral music) - [Father] That was a great dinner, as usual, Christine. You're a five-star cook. - Oh, you say that to everyone. (laughing) - How else would I get so many free meals? (laughing) - Say, did you hear they caught the Grady bandit after she tried to hold up the Texas Prairie bank? - Well, I'm afraid most of us don't keep up with things like that, Andy. Father? - Sure. Thank you. - It took 'em two years to finally catch her. - Hmm. - Andy, I'll never understand why you're not interested in the same things as other kids. Here, let me help you. - So, I heard you have Mrs. Jacobs for math this year. - Yeah, she's probably 150 years old. (suspenseful orchestral music) She's never even heard of new calculus texts. Check for fingerprints. - [Father] Well, a lot of your classmates haven't either, Andy. - Have some pie and ice cream, Father. - Oh, I may burst. - Come on. - But I how can I resist? (laughing) Thank you. - Andy? - Thanks. (light orchestral music) - Dinner was great, Christine. I won't need to eat for a week. (laughing) - Thank you so much for coming, Father. - It was a pleasure to have you, Father. - Thank you, Keith. - See you tomorrow in the rec room. - See you, Andy boy. - [Christine] Bye bye. Drive safe. - Oh, I almost forgot. It was pretty cold out tonight and I didn't turn the heaters on at the nursery. The plants might freeze. - Do you want me to go with you? - Well, no, that's all right, honey. Why don't you stay with Andy. I'll be right back. (thunder crashing) (light piano music) (horn honking) (car crashing) (grunting) (intense orchestral music) (car crashing) - Oh, please, please. (horn honking) (horn honking) (car crashing) (grunting) (light piano music) (heavy breathing) (ominous orchestral music) (screaming) (intense orchestral music) (car engine revving) (window smashing) (screaming) (grunting) (head thudding) (light piano music) (ominous orchestral music) - Should've taken the model with the airbag, Father. Buckle up for safety. (whistling) (car exploding) (light piano music) (saw whirring) (light orchestral music) - Hi, honey. I was in the neighborhood and I just decided to come in and say hello. - It's nice to see you, Jennifer, but I'm pretty busy. - What happened to your hand? - Oh, it's nothing. So, what's on your mind? - Well, I was just wondering whether you'd given any more thought to moving in with me and Nicky. - Well, to tell you the truth, I haven't had much time to think about it. - I don't understand, Keith. Is there something you're not telling me? Why are you acting so strange? - Maybe we need some time to rethink this whole thing, you know? There are just some complications I need to work out. You know, I don't take marriage lightly. You must understand that. - Keith, I am not waiting forever. With you or without you, I want to make a life for Nicky and myself here in Deer View. - No, no, no, no, I couldn't handle that. Not in the same town. Please, no more pressure. I told you, I need some more time. (ominous orchestral music) - Well, I'm sorry, but you've just about run out of time. - Very nice, don't you think? - Oh, ladies. Let me know if you need any help. (keyboard clicking) (light orchestral music) (knocking on door) (video game beeping) - Come in. - Hi, Andy. What ya doing? - Oh, nothing. Just playing a little video game. - Andy, I need you to be as strong as a little boy can be. - What's up? - I've got some sad news. - What? - Father Brennan died. (dramatic orchestral music) He was in a terrible car accident last night. Isn't that terrible? I can't tell you how sorry I am, son. You know, Andy, I've been thinking. You spend far too much time fooling around with this computer. You should be outside, having fun, like other normal boys your age. (cable unplugging) Let's try to be better friends. I wanna spend more time with you, slugger. Why don't we make a fresh start, just forget the past? (computer powering off) What do ya say? (crying) (sniffling) Good morning, family. Do you know what today is? Anybody wanna guess? It's Father's Day. So, happy Father's Day to me. (ominous orchestral music) - Who among us can unravel the mysterious fabric of life and death? Heavenly father, we ask you to accept our good friend and shepherd, Ernest Thomas Brennan, into your beloved arms. And now, Andy Davis, who was one of Father Brennan's closest friends, would like to say a few words. - I just wanted to say thank you, my friend. All the times you played with me and made me laugh. You were always there when I needed you. You were like a father to me. I miss you. I love you, Father Brennan. Goodbye. (crying) (ominous orchestral music) - [Priest] Our father, who art in heaven. - I'm gonna take a little walk. This is getting too upsetting. - [Priest] Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Amen. - [Group] Amen. - Amen. Okay? - Hmm? - I'll meet you back at the car. Okay? (ominous orchestral music) Jennifer? - [Jennifer] Oh, hi. - [Christine] Hi. - It's terrible about Father Brennan, isn't it? - Oh, it's a great loss. He was very dear to our family. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - I was wondering if I could talk to you about something. - Oh, is it about Nicky? He says he loves school. - Oh, no. He's doing just fine. He's a great little boy. - Oh, good. - Uh. It's a little awkward. Maybe now's not the right time. - Well, why don't I invite you to my home. I'm practically a recluse out there and I'd love the company. - Okay, later on this evening? - Oh, that would be great. Nicky's got a Cub Scout meeting, so we'd have time to relax a little bit. - About eight, 8:30? - That'd be perfect. Let me just give you directions. I'm the last house at the end of Harrelsburg Road. - I know just where it is. - Oh, okay. I'll see you then. - All right. - Okay. - Bye. - [Keith] So, who's that woman you were talking with after the service? - [Christine] Oh, well that was Jennifer Ashley. You know, she enrolled her son, Nicky, at school. - [Keith] Oh, yeah, yeah. So, what did she have to say? - [Christine] She invited me to her house tonight to talk. (ominous orchestral music) (car door closing) - Listen, Christine. I've gotta be alone for a while. After that funeral, I've gotta get my mind off Father Brennan. I'm gonna go to the nursery and do some work. Well, you're going out anyway. - But it's Sunday, Keith. - I know, but Mr. Thompson might be back next week and I'm behind on my work. I'll be back to spend time with Andy before you leave. Promise. - Go on inside, okay, honey? I'll be right there. - Okay. - Keith, I can postpone my talk with Jennifer until tomorrow if that's what you want. - It's all right, we'll have a late dinner when you get home tonight. - Oh, I'll just tell her to keep it short. It is a school night anyway. Look, Keith, I know Andy's really upset about Father Brennan's death. Could you talk to him? - Don't worry. I'll be sure to spend some time with him tonight. If you need me, call the nursery. (ominous orchestral music) - All right, I'll see you later. (truck door closing) - She had to do it. Can't leave me alone! Just wanna do it right. I just wanna do it right, but they never let me. (tires screeching) They make me do it! (light orchestral music) (sighing) - Mom. Mom, can you hear me? - Yeah, honey. What is it? - Is there anything that you think is strange about Keith? - We have to talk about this now, honey? - Well, is there anything that bothers you about him? - I'll let you know in a couple of hours, okay? - How come he's never mentioned any family or friends? - I don't know, Sherlock. What are you getting at? - You ever asked him about those scars behind his ears? - No, I never asked him. Why? Come on, Andy. Out with it, why? - Well, maybe Keith isn't who he says he is. I mean, maybe he's really someone else. - Yeah, well, with any luck, maybe he's really Kevin Costner or Tom Cruise. - Come on, mom. I'm serious. I'm really worried about this guy. - Okay, mister worrywart. What is it exactly that you're worried about? - I'm worried about him hurting you. - Oh, Andy. This is really serious, honey. I know Keith and I are having our problems, okay, but don't you think you're letting your imagination a little wild here? - I meant physically. (dramatic orchestral music) - Oh, honey. What is the matter with you? Keith has never ever done anything like that to me ever. Why, has he ever hurt you, honey? Has he ever hurt you? - No, no, he hasn't. - Oh, thank God. (phone ringing) Hello? - [Jennifer] Christine, I'm glad I caught you before you left. This is Jennifer. - Hi, Jennifer. - [Jennifer] Would it be okay if we postponed until tomorrow night? - Sure. There's no rush really. - My boyfriend just called. He said it was some kind of an emergency. - Your boyfriend? - [Jennifer] Yes, I have to go meet him right away. I'm really sorry. - That's okay. I understand. We'll talk tomorrow. - Thanks. I'll see you then. (dial tone humming) (ominous orchestral music) (door creaking) Keith? (ominous orchestral music) Keith? Keith? (owl hooting) (intense orchestral music) (water spraying) Keith? Keith? Where are you? (dog barking) (intense orchestral music) Oh, Keith, you scared the hell out of me. Why is it so dark in here? Why are we here at this hour? - Hi, honey. I'm glad you were able to make it on such short notice. - Oh, well, you said it was an emergency over the phone. - Yes, it is. I have an answer and I needed to tell you right away. - I don't understand. You mean about us living together? - Mm-hmm. I'm afraid the answer is no. You see, I need to protect my family. I can no longer allow you to endanger them. - What family? What are you talking about? - I have a wonderful family with a beautiful wife and a great little boy. And you have gotten in the way. - You son of a bitch. You lying bastard. (heavy smacking) (grunting) (intense orchestral music) - Are you upset with me, Jennifer? (grunting) What's your hurry, Jen? You just got here. (grunting) Don't worry, sweetheart. We'll have everything worked out soon. (grunting) (whistling) (motor whirring) (ominous orchestral music) - I'll be right back. - Mom, please don't go in there. - Andy, I don't wanna hear that nonsense again, okay? But I want you to stay put. (dog barking) (machine whirring) Keith? Are you there? (intense orchestral music) (gasping) - Hi, honey, what a pleasant surprise. - Oh, God, you scared me. - What are you doing here? I thought you were visiting Jennifer. - I was on my way there, but I just thought I'd drop by. So, are you alone? - Just me and my ficus. - Whose car is that outside? - I didn't know there was a car outside. - Where is she, Keith? That's Jennifer's car outside and you know it. - Christine, I would never do anything to harm our family. You know that. Everything is under control, believe me. You are my wife and I love you, so please go home and I'll meet you there soon. - I asked you where is she? (moaning) (ominous orchestral music) (sighing) - Things are getting very complicated. - Oh my God. (screaming) - I told you it was under control, but you wouldn't listen, would you? You wouldn't let me fix things, would you? (heavy smacking) (screaming) (grunting) (thunder crashing) (thunder crashing) (intense orchestral music) You couldn't leave well enough alone, could you? You had to get suspicious. You had to stop here! (thunder crashing) (grunting) (yelling) I was handling everything for our family. (yelling) (grunting) (grunting) Why didn't you just let me fix it? (grunting) (grunting) (heavy punching) (sighing) (grunting) Well, ladies, are you enjoying your talk? It's girl's night out. (grunting) (door creaking) - Mom? (ominous orchestral music) (machine whirring) Mom? (thunder crashing) (water spraying) (thunder crashing) (intense orchestral music) (gasping) (triumphant orchestral music) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (head thudding) (thunder crashing) - Andy, I didn't you were here, son. What a pleasant surprise. (ominous orchestral music) Don't worry, Andy. I know we can work this out. After all, father knows best. (grunting) Andy, come on. I knew you could get out of that chair. Andy, come on. (thunder crashing) Where are you, Andy? (grunting) Come on, son. Don't be afraid. (whimpering) Andy, where are you? Come to daddy. (whimpering) Andy, I see you found your mother's fork. (thunder crashing) Come on, Andy. Don't be afraid. Just come to daddy. Come on, slugger. (grunting) (screaming) (machine buzzing) (triumphant orchestral music) (heavy breathing) (screaming) - Not dead! (screaming) - Let go of my son, you bastard! Let go, let go! Let go! (screaming) (machine buzzing) (bones cracking) (screaming) (electricity zapping) (dramatic orchestral music) - Mom, are you all right? - Yes, I'm just fine, Andy. (rain falling) Let me help you up, okay? - No, no. I'm all right. I can do it. (gasping) (crying) Oh, I love you very much, Andy. - I love you too, mom. Happy Father's Day, slugger. (light orchestral music) (ominous orchestral music) (light synth music)
