- Aah! - Shh! Always by my side. Always by my side! I just can't believe I'm doing this, we should have kept on scamming tourists and be done. Do you want me to explain? These snakeskins are worth more than the purses and wallets that you steal. I don't care about that. Look, it's suicide to be here. It's suicide because you don't do what I tell you. - By my side! - No. I said no. It's insane to be hunting at a place like this. I'm not afraid of Las Arenas. Well, I am, so what? - See that? Bye! - Stay here! Stay! Aah! Josh: So, we're here. How does it feel to be home? Sof? Give me a second. I mean, this is where you were born right? Aren't you, I don't know, maybe a little bit nostalgic, maybe? Yeah, maybe. It feels weird to be here. It's been a while without being in Colombia. God. You and your guidebooks. I do like to do my research. These rainforests, they look amazing. You're dreaming if you think you have time to hike. Well, I brought my backpack. You called about international, right? - No charges? - No. You don't need it. You don't need it. Just use the WhatsApp. Josh, they're three and five. This is the first time we've ever left them. You want me to, what, send them a heart emoji? Okay, fine. We'll do it when... When I get to the hotel. No, I want to call my kids now. Sofia, we're, like, two minutes away. - I promised them I would. - Can you just wait? Please? No. Sofia: I love you, too. Be good for grandma and grandpa, all right? I love you. Bye. Let me talk... - Hey, we better check in. - Marcos: Josh! - Hey! There he is. - Marcos. - It's good to see you, buddy. - Good to see you, man. I can't thank you enough for doing this last minute. Especially you, Sofia. I know you stopped your practice when you had kids. Well, um, actually just getting back, so this is good. Everybody I called before you turned me down, so thanks for saving my ass, really. Well, happy to help. And you are. You are. Colombia is in need for more healthcare workers. Oh, yeah. Must feel good to be back, huh? Yeah, it's good to be here. It's gonna be hard to stay focused. I mean, this is a... This is a beautiful country you have here, man. Well, I shifted your schedules a little bit, so your presentation won't be until Friday. Great. Extra time to prepare. I thought you guys needed a little alone time. I know you don't get away from the kids that much, right? Thanks for thinking of us. You're still good for dinner tonight? Yeah, sure. 8:00. Is that all right? Yeah. Awesome. I'll see you then. Good to see you, man. Your passport. - Do you have it? - No, I don't. - Why should I have it? - Yeah. Okay. No, this... it's my fault. Marcos booked the rooms and I haven't told him yet. Let me see. You should tell him before dinner. Won't that be a bit awkward? Then tell him after. You guys are closer anyways, right? It's a pretty great room, right? Okay, I'm sure that they'll have an extra cot or something. You heard her. The hotel is packed with people for this conference. All right, fine. I'll sleep right there. - On the couch. - No, I will. You know what? Whatever you prefer. I don't know what the big deal is. We just sat on an airplane for six hours right next to each other. I just don't want to sleep in the same room as you. I need space to work. Jesus, it's only for a few days. That's not the point. I mean, we haven't been under the same roof together in, like, months, so it's not gonna kill you. Could you please stop talking? Thank you. I don't like it either, all right? I'm just trying to make the best of it. Yeah, just like you. Just trying to make the best of a bad situation, right? If I'm such a fucking asshole, then why did you bother to come? Because I need this. Look... I'll just be working in the business center. - Whatever. Fine. - Yeah, and also, I'll leave dinner early tonight so you can tell Marcos. I wish I had been there. You should have seen your husband's face when he realized he was stuck. - I was not stuck. - That's bullshit. No, no, no, no. Fine, I was... I was choosing not to go forward. - Sounds the same to me. - Okay, okay. I was stuck. But in my defense, it was fucking pouring rain. - Where was this? - Both: Uh, Brazil. It was, like, five years ago. Oh, yeah. Right after Sadie was born. I hope you guys don't mind. I ordered some Colombian food. It's very nice. It's called mondongo. - You're gonna love it. - Mondongo has meat, right? There's meat in the... - Yeah, no, no. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. I forgot to tell you, Sofia is a vegetarian now. Really? Since when? When I was pregnant with Andy, with our first, I realized I couldn't eat anything that had a mother. - Okay, I can respect that. - Mm. I don't have a problem. Josh: It's very good. No, it's good. I love to do my research. I've been digging around. Looks like a lot of pretty awesome places to go hiking. It's too bad you're all booked up. Well, I'm actually trying to clear up my morning, so do you know this place called Cascada la Chorrera? Josh: Uh, yeah. It's only Colombia's highest waterfall. - It's a beautiful place. - No, it's very beautiful. And it's very close. It's in Choachi. Really close. - You wanna go? - Yeah, I wanna go. Let's do it. Marcos: Hey, I noticed you still have the same awful - backpack you had in college. - Oh, yeah. The one strapped with the duct tape. Careful. That's my lucky backpack. Marcos: Well, it's fucking terrible. - It's pretty awful. - Marcos: Right? I hope you don't mind me stealing your husband, - but if you wanna come... - No, no. Sof wouldn't be into it. Really? Not really your thing, is it? I love hiking. We used to do it a lot. Sof, you haven't been hiking in, like, ten years? So what? It doesn't mean I stopped enjoying it. It must be hard to hike with the little ones - strapped to your back. - Exactly. But you know what? I should pass. Not because I don't like it or I don't enjoy it, but because I have a lot of prep to do before Friday. I'm telling you, you're going to do great. I don't know about this guy, but... Yeah, well, I'm gonna do the same presentation I've been doing for years, so I'll be fine. Actually, I should head to bed. Bye, guys. Did I say something wrong? No, no. It's not you. I was gonna tell you earlier. I should have, probably. Sofia and I have decided that we're gonna split up. What? When? It's fairly recent, so... Wow. You guys are the perfect couple. Yeah. Are you seeing someone else? It's not that. It's just, um... We've changed and we'll be better off apart. I don't know what to say. Say, "Josh, what time am I picking you up so we can go hiking tomorrow morning?" Okay. Cheers. Sofia: Why aren't you dressed? Oh, Marcos couldn't get free. Oh. Okay. I think I wanna go. - To? - Choachi. I don't get many chances to do stuff like this, so, yeah. Are you gonna go by yourself? Who else would I go with? Come on, Sofia. I'll be back tonight. I... I can go with you. I'll be fine on my own. I know I'm the last person that you wanna be around right now, but come on. It's not safe to go hiking around here by yourself. Okay. Okay? Okay. Let's go. Let's go. - Okay. - Josh: No, no, no, wait. Is this the only road? Because, I mean, that's gonna take us hours, right? Sofia: Well, looks like if we drove through this area, - we'll get there faster? - Pedro: No, no, no, no, no. That's Las Arenas. It's not a safe place. What's Las Arenas? I've never heard of it. It's north of Choachi, close to the water. Even locals won't go there. It's quite dangerous. I'm a pretty experienced hiker, so... Um, wildlife there is dangerous. Particularly snakes. Big snakes. Snakes? I'm Colombian. I don't remember snakes being in cold mountains. Times have changed. As climate gets warmer, you have new species coming in. Not to talk about the erosion. You see, the land is not very steady. You have steep ravines, unsteady ground. - We'll avoid it, then. - No, no, no, I mean, the other way, it'll save us time. - No way. I hate snakes. - She's right. Las Arenas is not a place you want to find yourself. Would you help me with this, please? Thank you. This altitude is no joke. - Here. - Thanks. Thank you for waiting for me. I had a cramp. Okay. Oh, shit. Ah, that's not good. Fuck. Babe, we gotta turn back. We're not going back. We're so close. You really wanna cut it short? No, I don't want to cut it short. But I definitely don't want to get caught in that. Come on. We gotta go. Trust me. We gotta go. - Okay. - Come on, we gotta walk fast. Thanks. Oh, shit. Shit. He's breaking into the car. - I'll go talk to him. - No. What are you doing? - No, we don't. - Yes, we do. Please, stay put until he leaves. - What if he steals the car? - You're not going out there. - I'm just gonna scare him off. - Hey, he's not a pigeon. - You don't know what he'll do. - Yeah, well... listen. Shh! Look, I am not getting stuck here. - Please. - No. Shh. Please, please. Stay hidden, stay out of sight. I've got this. Just back off. Josh: Hey! Can I help you with something? Whoa. Oh! Whoa, whoa. No have money. No wallet. Yeah. Okay. She left. It's only me. It's only me. What are you doing? Shh! Run! Run! Josh: Go! Go, go go! Are you okay? We should go that way, where no one goes. Las Arenas. He won't follow us. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Do you think he's gone? Fuck, I don't know. - What the fuck are we gonna do? - Okay, listen. Listen to me. We'll do your plan. We'll go to Las Arenas and we'll wait out the storm. All right? Come on. Come on! What? - You had to be the hero. - So this is my fucking fault? You always think you can talk yourself out of everything. How was I supposed to know that he had a gun? If you had stayed put as I told you, none of this would have happened! You are un-fucking-believable! Just run! Run, Sof! Run! Go! Sofia: Josh. Josh. Josh? Josh! Josh! Josh! Fuck! Help! Sofia! - Sofia! - Josh! Josh! Josh! Josh! Josh! Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop, stop! Calm... calm down, okay? Try and move to my hand. - It's too thick. - Baby, you gotta try, okay? - I can't! I'm stuck! - Okay, just hang on. Hang on. Hang on. I can't even stick out my arms! Hold on! Wait, okay? Try to reach it, okay? Come on, baby! You can do it! Try, babe. Come on. Get it. Ah, fuck! Okay, wait. Wait. Hold on, okay? Just stay calm, okay? No, no! Don't! Stop moving! Stop moving! Don't move! Stop moving! Sofia! Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. I got you. I got you. Come on, come on. Come on! I got you. I got you! Okay? I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. - It's okay. It's okay. - What... what did you... Shh, shh, shh. Just stay calm. - But why... why are you here? - No, no, no. Stay calm. I don't... don't move, okay? Don't move. We both need to be perfectly still, okay? You should've... I think... I think this is like quicksand. Josh, you there? I got free early. Josh? Marcos, buddy, I know we were gonna meet up later, but, uh, Sofia and I are gonna actually go hiking in Choachi, so we probably won't be back till late, and I guess I'll see you tomorrow, man. Cheers. Okay. Josh: At least it stopped raining. Sofia: I think I moved a little. - Josh: No, you didn't. - Look! Josh: You didn't, honey. I need... I need to look at your head. - Come on. - It's fine. Baby, let me look at your head. We just need to get out of this. God, isn't it crazy that we're stuck? Well, I wouldn't worry too much, okay? I've never heard of anybody fucking dying in quicksand. Won't it suck us down? No, it doesn't work that way. The weight of the mud, its density is... it's heavier than the human body. - How the fuck do you know that? - The guidebook. It says water, it flows in and it gets trapped underneath the dirt and it creates this fucking heavy as shit mud. - How far down does it go? - I don't know. Didn't the guidebook tell you how to get out of this? No. Okay, just give me... Give me a second here, okay? I'm gonna try to go backward. Just push me. Just... no. Don't do that. No, I just... Just... I just... Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck. I can't move, man. Look over there. Josh: Where did that come from? I think I knocked it loose when I was falling. See how it is resting over the surface? Maybe I can spread out my body weight so I won't sink. - Try to push me over the edge. - Sof. Try to push me over the edge. We can't even move our fucking legs. Please. - Just try. - What do you want me to do? - Give me your hand. - Okay. - Stay put. - Okay. Wait. Just wait. Let me get this hand fucking down there. Give me a... I can grab you. Just... just wait. Wait. No, fuck it. Just hold on. Fuck. It's not working. It's not gonna work. Just wait. Try to take off my boot. Let me try. - Fuck. - What? - There's something down here. - What? - What? What do you mean? - There's something down here. - What do you mean? - I don't know what it is. - Oh, shit. Okay, I'll... - Let's try to pull it. - At three. Together, okay? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. - One, two, three. - Yeah. Yeah. Fuck! Fuck! - Fuck! - Jesus fucking Christ. - Look at his skin. - Yeah. The tissue degradation on his face. He starved to death. Fuck. Okay, okay. Baby. I'm gonna try to get his pack off, all right? I got his pack. Let me help. Let me help. I can't stand this. We should put him back. Help me. Hang on. Let's see what he's got. Look. - There's a knife. - Okay. Oh, yeah. Some light reading material. What was he out here hunting? I don't think we wanna know. Two shells left. Why didn't he just kill himself? - Brutal way to die. - Yeah. Okay. The way I see it, we only got two ways out of here. Either someone pulls us out. No one knows we're here, Josh! No one! Okay! So we got to pull ourselves out. - How? - Look behind me. You see that tree stump and that rock? What about it? They look strong enough to hold your weight. - It's fucking far away. - Yeah. So... we cut this backpack into strips and we tie it together. It's cotton canvas. It should hold. - You're gonna lasso that rock? - No. You are. I'm not sure I can do it. Sof, it's our only fucking chance. Help me. I'll hold the bag, you cut. Watch your fucking fingers. Yeah. Cut. Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Josh: Wait. Wait one sec. One sec, one sec, one sec. Come on. Watch your fingers. Here, here. Here. Okay. Okay. That's that. Do you think it'll be enough? We'll see. Remember that conference in Texas? I was just thinking about that. We were about to take that rodeo lesson. - You got food poisoning. - Yeah. Who orders twenty oysters in a restaurant in Texas? I don't know. A lasso would have come in handy then. Hey. You got this. I'll do my best. Okay. You got it. You got it. Here, just wait. Let me hold this up. I can just... pull this stuff up. Okay. Go. How short are we? - I think eight feet or so. - Fuck. Maybe if we cut the straps, we can make it longer. No, no. I made them this thick for a reason. Need to make sure they don't break. Okay, wait. I'll take off my jacket. We'll use my jacket. - Are you able to do it? - Yeah, I can do it. - I'll do the same. - No. No. Sof, you gotta keep yours on, okay? - You'll freeze to death. - We need more than one. What then? Marcos. Marcos will come. He'll find us. We just said it. They don't have a clue where we are. But in the morning, when we're not there, - he'll know something's up. - And then do what? And then he'll fucking... He'll call the police. They'll send out a search party. Do you know how big is this rainforest? Marcos thinks we are, like, an hour away from this. That is not the point. The point is people will be looking for us. Josh! Look! Hey! Hey, we're here! - Hey! - We're here! - Josh: Hey, hey! - Hey! It's one of those sight-seeing tours. Hey! Sofia: Hey! Josh: Fuck, they can't see us. Hey! Hey! The whole point of that tour is to look down. They could see us. The trees are too fucking thick. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! What are you doing? They will see the fire or the smoke. - Sofia, it's not gonna work. - Yes, it's gonna work. - It's not gonna work. - Yes, it's gonna work! - Honey. Honey. - Fuck. It's not gonna catch on fire. It's not gonna work. - It's gonna work. - You would need a stack of dry Bibles to catch on fire, okay? There's not gonna be any fucking fire. This is the only thing we have. I told you. It's not gonna work. No, no, no, no, stop. Stop! - We need to make real fire! - No! - Let me do it! Let me do it! - No! If you burn this and they don't see it, it's all we fucking have! We don't have anything anyways. Let me! We're gonna lose our chance... You're not gonna fucking burn it! You're not fucking burning it! You're not burning it! You're not fucking burning it. We just fucked up our chance. Someone's gonna find us. Do you have any granola bar in your pocket by any chance? All the food, the water, it's all in my backpack. We're gonna get dehydrated. You don't know that. You don't know... By this time tomorrow we might be in the dining room at the hotel, having lunch, laughing about all this with Marcos. - I don't think so. - I'm just... I'm trying to stay positive. Fuck. It's early! We might get back tonight in time for dinner. Could you please stop talking about dinner and breakfast? I just don't want to be reminded. Thank you. You're the one who brought it up! It's true. Ouch! Ow, ow! Ouch, ouch! - What's wrong? - Something bit me. - What? - Ouch! It's killing me. - Help me! Help me! - I can't... I can't reach you. It's ants. Fucking swipe them away. - Help me. What... - I can't fucking reach you. - What is... the fuck? - Ants. Ants. Wait, wait, wait. Just give me a second. Hang on. Hang on. I got something. Okay. Here, use this, use this, use this. The alcohol acts as a repellent. Yes. Yeah, it's working. Your neck, your neck, your neck. Your fucking neck. Over there, over there. Right there, right there. - Right there. It's working. - Fuck. - Oh, it's burning. - Yeah, yeah. In the back. - In the back. In the back. - Oh, it's burning. Oh! It worked. It's working. It worked, baby. Okay. Okay. Oh, babe. Baby, baby. Baby, baby, baby. No, I still feel them. I still feel them. - No, no, they're gone. Hon. - Ow, fuck. Sof, they're gone, baby. You're okay. You're okay. We got them. We got them. You're okay. They're gone. They're gone. You have been carrying this around? I had it tucked away. In your underwear? I didn't... I didn't want you to see it. You don't have a granola bar, but you have vodka. You were sober for so long. Or at least I thought that. - When did you start again? - I don't know. I don't know. It's... it's, um... it's been a while. Have you been drinking at the hospital? No. No. Sofia, no. You know I'd never do that. Then why? I've been under a lot of stress. The work. With us. - Us? - Yeah. Getting divorced sucks. Trust me. I know, too. But, you know, we're miserable, right? We just walk around like fucking strangers. Strangers would have been better. You and me... we didn't even like each other. Why didn't we use the rifle? What? Why didn't we shoot it to get the helicopter's attention? Hand it to me. What? Please. Just be very careful. It's loaded. Sofia: We just need eight more feet. Think it'll hold? - It's about two feet. - Who cares? It's not gonna be long enough. Sofia: At least I'm trying. - It's something. - We need to accept that we're gonna be here for a long while, - maybe even days. - Not if we get creative. Marcos will notice that we're missing. - We can't rely on him. - Yes, we can. We just need to find a way to... Fuck. Fuck! Josh! Fuck! A snake! It can't come on this quicksand, right? Listen to me. Listen to me. Shh. Don't move. It's defending its young. The egg. I knocked it out. Is it venomous? - Fuck, probably. - Fuck. Josh: Okay, we can't let it bite us, so pick up the gun. Pick up the gun. Pick up the gun. Honey, pick up the gun. I've never used one before. You can do this. Pick it up now. Pick it up now, all right? You got it. Baby, you can do it. It's a shotgun. It's got a big kick, but the good news is whatever you point it at, you're probably gonna kill it. Come on. Honey, honey? Let me see. Josh: This is bad. This is bad. Oh, God, it's bad. It's bad. It is bad. I need to slow down the venom. We need every inch of the rope. No, no, no. I need you to shut up, okay? I need your heart rate to stay as low as possible. Ah! Jesus! Okay, we know... we know... We both know how this goes, okay? The venom attacks the cells, yeah? Then it attacks the organs. Okay, my organs are going to shut down. I need to get to a hospital. No, no. So, look at me. Calm down. All right? We still have time. We still have time. - We don't. - Six hours. Maybe more. I'm gonna be in a fuckload of pain, baby. I'm gonna be in a fuckload of pain. Hey. Hey, look at me. Are my friends alive? Do you want money? I've got 200 dollars. If you want them, they are yours but tell me where they are. Hand them over. They are upstairs in my bag. When we get out of here I'll tell the police this was all a misunderstanding, I made a mistake and then I give you the money. Give me that watch. It was my dad's. Then don't give me anything. This is worth a lot, you better start talking. A week ago, I was hunting snakes. - Snakes? - Yes. Venom is well paid. Skins too, - I was at Las Arenas. - Is that where they are? That's where I saw them. But they are alright. Do you know why they call it Las Arenas? That place is called Las Arenas because there's a lot of quicksands, There's no quicksand in this country; that's bullshit. Did you know I went hunting with a friend, but I came back alone. If you don't want to believe me, it's your problem, but they are in danger. Hey, buddy, I'm a doctor. I organized the conference here. Let me out. I mean it; My friends are in danger. If you want, call the manager. Let me out! Josh: Fuck! I won't calm down. I won't fucking calm down 'cause is fucking bullshit! - Just try. Try to relax! - All we did was go on a hike! And now we're stuck in fucking... Fucking quicksand! But just try to relax, all right? Fuck this fucking... fucking place. Josh, the faster your heart rate, the faster the venom spreads, remember? Right? Mm-hmm. All right. Okay. Isn't that amazing? One minute I'm at a fucking golf course with my buddies. My phone rings. It's Marcos. He's like, "Hey, Josh, man, think Sof can join us in Colombia for the conference?" Now look at us. We're here in beautiful Bogota. I just got... I just got bitten by a fucking giant venomous snake. - Stop. Stop. - Fuck. Fuck. - Fuck. - Let me see your arm. It's no use. Okay? It'll be no different than the last time you looked at it, honey. Honey, honey. Honey, there's nothing you can do for me. Can I ask you something? Yeah. Why did you change your mind? About what? About going hiking with me and Marcos. I already told you. You sure there wasn't something else? No. That was it. You blame me. For what? If I hadn't changed my mind, you'd be preparing for your lecture. No. No, no, no. I didn't say that. But it's true. Honey, don't put words in my mouth. That's not what... Then why did you bring it up now? I don't know. Because it's my fault? I'm so sorry. Me, too. Ah, fuck. Oh! Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. - Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. - Let me see. Let me see. - Does it hurt? - It hurts everywhere. Do you feel when I press down here? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - Are they warm? - Yeah. It's pretty hot. - I think it's thrombophlebitis. - What? It's coagulating your blood, turning it to Jell-O. At least dying by a stroke is better than starving to death, right? Don't say that. What are you doing? What are you doing? No, no. Sofia. There's a clot. It's blocking your blood flow to your brain. You're gonna have a stroke. I have to do this, all right? Put down the knife. You haven't done anything like this in years. I'm still a doctor. I'm gonna cut your clot, all right? Honey. Baby, come on. Fuck. Just let me. All right? Why won't you let me? Because there's only one bullet left. You have to trust me when I'm telling you we're gonna get out of this. No one's coming for us. - Let me. Oh, shit. - Honey. No. Oh, my God. It's getting worse. Jesus. - I have to do it now. - I don't want you to. I've taken two oaths in my life. One as a doctor. One as a wife. You don't get to decide. Baby. Baby, look at me. It's gonna hurt. Yep. - Where you gonna cut? - Carotid artery. Make sure you seal it up when you're done? I won't let you bleed out, believe me. I love you. I... We're almost there. You're doing great, babe. Almost done. We're almost there, babe. Here. Fuck. Oh, my God. Hi. How are you feeling? My body is a little numb. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Okay. It's in shock. How long was I out? An hour, I guess. - You did it. - We made it. You did it. Thank you. Do you remember what you said before you passed out? Yeah. Did you mean it? Did I mean it? Yeah, I did. Do you think our kids already know that we're missing? God, I hope not. Yeah, maybe not. There's one thing that keeps going through my mind over and over in this sick and stupid way. What's that? That I'm not gonna get to give that lecture. Isn't it crazy that I'm so consumed with that? That is not crazy. No, it's not crazy. Maybe I just needed it. It was so important. Something to bring my confidence back before I started work. You don't need a lecture to do that. I do, though. More than you think. - Josh, I was so good. - Uh-huh. - Yeah. Yeah. - I was really good. Top of our class. The first to be published. I got staffed at the number one hospital in the city. You're a great doctor. But then I stopped. I know I was making the right decision. I still believe that. I wanted to be around for the kids. But there's this thing I just... I just lost. I became a mother. Your wife. But somehow me? Me. Sofia. It's so hard to find sometimes. I don't know where I am. I still see the real you. You don't, though. Should've said this to you more often. - I should've... no. - Please stop. The sacrifice you made to stop working? Stay home with our kids? They are so much better off because of it. Sof, you're such a good mother. They are so lucky to have you. I was so lucky to have you. I can't stop thinking about them. - I know. - Our home waiting for us. I don't want them to be alone. I don't wanna leave them. They're going to be okay, you know? They're... They're going to be okay. I love you. I love you, too. So I need eight more feet to lasso that rock. Hmm. Maybe, yeah. The snake. It's longer than eight feet. Okay, what do you mean? It's thick. It won't break. - Uh-huh. - We can use it as a rope. I don't think the snake's gonna let you tie it to a rope backpack around its head. I'm gonna kill it.
