Mr. yip, sign here unless you wish to add anything - Excuse me, should I - That'll do - First time? - What? First time seeing a corpse? You don't owe him anything; Don't worry Detective I want to say something's off of course today's school system is inhumane we get a new case every few weeks he never once looked at his son he looked at me you panicked and tripped, of course he'd look at you he never once looked at his son are you sure? You were in a panic He didn't behave like he'd just lost a child listen, take a few days off, if you recall anything else call me Remember to take your medication, or your wound will get infected I'll see you later at your place? Bye bye it died after one call; Replace it! Didn't he... umm... this? Apparently, stepchildren are often murder victims in insurance scams it can't be... this is Hong Kong suicide is covered after 13 months from the date of purchase he died one week after it came into effect isn't it unusual to buy such a large policy for a child? He and his wife also have large policies if it was an issue, coverage would have been denied the underwriting took 4 months; They suspected something they probably just took their time! How do you do, sir? May I help you? How may I help you, sir? Yip wing-shun Mr. chu, how may I help you? Where's my payout? The insurance company hasn't approved it yet it's been a week! We have a protocol I'll call you if there's news it's been a week we must wait for the autopsy you saw it happen! Yes... but I'm not the coroner you saw it happen It's too tight the tighter the better it's just a flesh wound I'm a psychology major so, what's the diagnosis? PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder what does that mean? You'll have nightmares, bad-temper... Paranoia and constant anxiety but doctor, I don't feel any stress at all in fact, when I see you... I feel certain urges because you're trying to de-stress... What is it? Whisper in my ear Sorry I think you're right hush... The two incidents seem so similar Such thoughts will only lead you down a rabbit hole I can't let it go I want to dig deeper PTSD can be quite serious you should think of your health We can't just think about ourselves Please leave a message after the 'beep' the voicemail is full, goodbye Detective! I've been looking for you kid, nothing better to do? I want to ask about the child suicide case the autopsy report is out; The family will be notified - cause of death? - Suicide really? That's what the coroner concluded! You need to investigate further there might be abuse or neglect involved the child left school on his own kid, the police don't work for insurance companies do your own groundwork or hire a private investigator if you have to I'll reopen the case when you come up with some evidence it's case-closed stop pestering me How can I remember? It's been a year! The child's name was chu kafu you sold three policies to the family ah yes, his mother was shum chi-ling! His father was chu chung-tak! He was odd even as a child you've known them since childhood? We studied at the same grade school did you keep in touch? It was a strange coincidence, come to think of it that day, I was meeting 3 grade school buddies at this restaurant! Do you have a reservation, ma'am? Business was slow so I reconnected with some old schoolmates on Facebook when word spread, ten of them showed up! What's her name? I remember you, don't tell me... Shum chi-ling wow... it's been so long! Come with me everyone... It's shum chi-ling! Shum, how have you been...? Make some room... It's still the same? It's getting worse the doctor said to join the blind union how long before you lose your sight? About a year what worries me most... Is not being able to look after my son then you must plan ahead for his future I'm not here just to sell insurance don't worry, I really want to help she didn't have a limp as a child! What happened to her? I felt sorry for her so I asked about her husband that was when I found out my company sells many different plans if you don't mind... What's your husband's profession? He works in a scrap yard do you remember chu chung-tak? Chi-ling may be half-blind... But she doesn't deserve someone like that! In grade 5, our school pets all died overnight we all knew it was chu but the principal defended him he sounds dangerous he was! He was also a stalker! He stalked chi-ling for a long time women can truly be blind sometimes they knowingly throw themselves at horrible men not to mention, she is blind! Hello, Mr. chu a payout hasn't been approved yet what about kafu? Make way, please there's a protocol excuse me I'll call you if there's news Mr. chu, how may I help you? What're you doing? - Quiet! - What? Quiet! He's almost done I have a dinner date! Where are you? Behind you okay I'm sorry! You know him? Hello, who's there? Hello? Hello? Who's there? Hello? Au lai-shan wasn't there that day no one, including me, knows the real truth when I arrived at school that morning... The students were already at the zoo, beating chu up beat him up... beat him up...! I asked around someone had killed all the school pets; the girls in charge of the pets were all crying I asked chu but he couldn't explained himself so all children accused him Don't rush, watch your steps... Special education didn't exist then he was different but he was a kind soul we published a student essay collection each year chu's essay was quite moving how did it get resolved? We calmed the students and conducted an informal inquiry the school later concluded that it was an accident... No students were involved why does lai-shan still think chu was responsible? Because of what happened the following year who's that? The student who slapped chu in the face even the police suspected chu but another student provided an alibi for him why would that student cover for him? We all asked the same question but in fact, they barely knew each other still, rumors spread... It must be chu chung-tak... Chu did it for sure! This may take some time I believe every child is essentially good you'll see when you read his essay principal, you're too kind I hope he's a kind soul, too parent handbook graduation certificates school yearbook but the essays... are missing missing? I can ask the old students, I'll let you know? You're still in touch with your old students? The sweet ones visit me now and then do you recall a student named shum chi-ling? If they aren't special or don't visit on alumni day... I won't remember them Mr. chu, I'll get Mr. yip for you sir, coming here every day won't speed up the process we'll notify you if there's news The insurance claim will take two weeks two weeks? Yes, two weeks please help us kafu is alone in the morgue! I understand without the money... We can't even bury him I'll notify you at the earliest okay Sir, what're you doing...? What're you doing? Clean it up! Let me how can you be so clumsy? Does it hurt? Let's go home... Man wai-yee, what do you make of Mr. a? - Criminal personality - I don't get it Most criminals... Are no different from ordinary people they turn to violence primarily due to childhood traumas... Or the inability to satisfy their desires in short... They can be cured! And the criminal personality? How would you define conscience? The ability to tell right from wrong... The difference between good and evil the criminal personality knows right from wrong... But always believes they're right they are narcissists that lack empathy... They are the only masters and the rest are slaves there's some debate about the correlation between crime and personality traits but the criminal personality is innate there's no cure! Are you saying the entire correctional system is useless? No, there just needs to be reform err on the side of punishment not compassion only punishment I don't need your approval I just need proof "'getting ahead of the crime' by Dr. kam ching-sek" How do you do? I'm from Hayden brokerage, my name is yip I wonder if you know a worker named chu chung-tak? The boss may know; We only know nicknames how about chung or taky? We have a few chungs here we're all "tacky" and sleazy too! Ah... nine digits! Nine midgets? Nine digits, he's missing a finger do you know how he lost a finger? Who knows? Could be gambling after losing big, cut it off to claim workers compensation will your boss know... If he filed a claim? Ask him, the one in the shirt thanks boss! Are you trying to kill me? Hello? Hello? Speak up! Messing with me? I'll mess you right back! Psycho! Think your prank calls scare me? That's right! Bingo! Of course... I'll help you... Hello... hello? You still there...? You murdered your son! Don't deny it! Mr. chu, are you alright? Why did you contact my client? I'll get in trouble! Is he Mr. a? Do you want to "get ahead of the crime"? Give me your business card I promise to be in touch What's in that room? That room is off-limits find anything else about him? Nope, he's just slow... an easy Mark We don't use scare tactics anymore they still don't pay up anyway workers compensation is more practical... Not true, you could sell your kidney! I promise you'll get it this time the money god is here! Now what? You're useless! Kafu can be exchanged for money! What about you? Huh? What can you do? You're useless...! That's enough! Stop play-acting I"il give you a few more days or else file an accident claim get out! Please leave the office Call the police, I'm being harassed! No need! Your claim has been approved, sign here and it's done how did it get approved? What? The child suicide case! Oh good... They won't be hangingaround here anymore delay it for a few days; I'm sure chu did it! I'll find proof! Has a cheque been issued? We can't delay it someone died! Have you no heart? Kid, we must hand over the cheque! But maybe you can... uhmm... Uhmm... "Tear" it by accident it'll take days to issue another cheque insurance is supposed to help people, not get them killed! Have you lost your mind? I didn't believe it when people said you've changed this is none of your business! I defend you on a daily basis but you'd rather defend outsiders? You're just a salesman! Play detective on your own! Leave me out of it! Mr. chu, please reread the insurance contract... See here? You're the primary beneficiary... Hello, Mrs. chu should I sign it? How are your eyes? Daylight hurts my eyes it's easier at night where do I sign? Be careful, Mrs. chu your plan is worth a lot I don't understand just be careful if anything, call me your son didn't commit suicide Thank you... you saved my life, thank you did you hear him? Shameless! Money saved his life! You're a good boy! I'll take you to McDonalds! Their insurance claim... Won't end here He won't be any help it's not just a difference of opinion I object to his character he's your dissertation advisor! I didn't have a choice back then! You might lose your broker's license... Even go to prison? It'll be worth it if he proves that chu committed murder any one of them could have done it the child could have killed himself! The wife could have done it! She's crippled and half blind! I don't see... Know why he studies the criminal personality? Because he's one of them! I don't care about his personality! I saw the child die... I can't pretend nothing happened! Are you selling out a client for your own peace of mind? "I'm busy writing a paper” "I'll be unavailable, take your book back" "I need info on different webcams and prices" You're Mrs. chu? My name is kam, from Hayden brokerage I'd like to discuss the settlement with the two of you my husband isn't home he must be at work how careless of me I can discuss with you just the same may I come in? Sure Have a sausage roll? No, thanks What about the payout? It's not about present... But future payouts you're in grave danger your husband... murdered your son impossible I met with him once he lost it he has impulse control issues! Don't you want any? You may get hungry chung-tak isn't like that at all he's very easy going! Perhaps you're mistaken? No, he must be playing dumb his IQ is higher than you think, making him even more dangerous You're... So considerate I hope you can work with me let me interview you so I can keep an eye on Mr. chu it's the only way to ensure your safety would you like some water? Are you going to interview me on TV? If you have questions, ask my husband directly chung-tak! Chung-tak! Chung-tak! Sausage roll and coffee... gives me energy No, listen to me... Listen to me he gave me the scoop about you I'll give you the scoop about him his girlfriend is a student of mine... Well, yes or no? Yes or no? "Chung-tak... are you scared?" "London bridge is falling down" "falling down, falling down" "London bridge is falling down" "my fair lady" criminal personality... - Use both hands... ah... - Controlling... - Good boy... - Controlling... Follow me good, forward... now to the side... Another step forward... good... Another step forth... Controlling personality... Another step forth... Mr. chu! Mr. chu! No! No! Help! Help! Aaaah... Chow yuet-long forgot her textbook today she said the cat ate it the cat must be full? What will its poo poo look like? Silly girl - Mr. chiang! What a coincidence? I came to ask your advice papa, I want Sushi I want Sushi too - let me treat you? - Mhm! Too late, the cheque was issued; don't risk the company's reputation only you believe me we've been scammed before your client was ecstatic what's more gratifying than money? Beating the system and getting away with it what will happen if I reopen the case? All the signatories will be liable why can't you just let it slide? He set me up he used me as his alibi just go sing karaoke or take a vacation you'll get over it eventually my girlfriend often reminds me not to link two incidents together you! What are you staring at? What are you staring at? My brother loved insects we played in the park after school every day that day, I couldn't find him... Faster... run! Go there! I said fetch me some jumping spiders! - Squat down! - Are you stupid? Are you playing with me? A mantis? Think it's funny? What's wrong? You know him? No... Do you know him? No - no? Don't lie to me! Got any money? Take it out hurry it up! Here hurry it up! Don't you dare tell on me! Run, run away...! If I had stayed behind to protect my brother... Or admitted from the start that I knew him I wonder if it would havechanged anything then what? My brother jumped to his death you failed to defend your brother then, so now you want to defend the child? Papal! Is your wife at work? She's dead to me! Ah... into the bowl no wonder they didn't show up they're all spoiled they don't even like rice you're a cat person too? I have five at home stray cats are so pitiful if you don't feed them, they eat out of trashcans you named them all, didn't you? How did you know? Does my face scream "cat lady"? The shy one is called farah then there're snowy, blackie and coffee the silly one is called... Shun is there a washroom nearby? The nearest one is next to my office... Just follow me, I'm heading there thanks where are all the cats today? Do you like cats too? As much as you Hello? Are you done sulking? What's wrong? They all... Aaaah! You're saying, after he received his settlement... He mailed you a cat's head to scare you it must be him... Did your girlfriend discover the decapitated cats? His wife is shum chi-ling what? Experiencing any problems with your girlfriend? Did you cheat? The next one to die... is shum chi-ling he must be on drugs it doesn't make sense! Let's leave he murdered his stepson... Harassed me at the office compulsive gambler, wife-beater... When he loses all his money... He'll kill his wife next then comes to the office to threaten me again... Demanding a payout chu chung-tak... You don't scare me - Did you win? - Shut up you won, let's go shut up - place your bets... - It's my lucky day - Place your bets... Place your bets... Betting closed! Next time I'll cut off your hand - deal or stay? - Deal "3" the dealer must deal the dealer has "18" the winning hand was yours the dealer lost with even "18" place your bets! Triple win then I'll leave place your bets! Deal or stay...? "7", "7", "7" "20" the house wins all Day off? Chu kafu... autism self-harm tendencies so what? Think he deserved to die? It's possible he killed himself what about chu chung-tak? A witness said he was at work all morning - another false alibi... - What? He used a false alibi when he was in grade school! Now you doubt my findings? What about the cat? He threatened me! I'm not your lackey! I have to go! Papa, get up... His type always repeats his crimes, just you wait you told me to watch out for scams! Now you're telling me to be patient? He's clean, should be no problem? I'll request an immediate approval; but it's up to the insurance company not using methadone? Any other drugs? If we discover otherwise... What did you say? He's just offering a friendly reminder I said... Ntn regional crime unit; Where's yip wing-shun? I said you crooks should take a walk you asshole! Police! What're you doing? Just playing which one is yip wing-shun? Ring a bell? Look here according to the coroner, the victim was tortured for days before his death Can you show me his teeth? Here He's kam ching-sek, a psychology professor I recognize his gold teeth we found a lead... Kam ching-sek, a professor... How did you find me? We found your business card on the murder victim you're a possible suspect but seeing you throw up... Didn't you leave school together? Why weren't you two together? I'm sorry, I'm sorry... I'm sorry Ghost mantises can't be raised in pairs; the female will devour the male thank you... you saved my life thank you please leave the office! I'll call you if there's news be careful, Mrs. chu, your plan is worth a lot I don't understand Hello? I'm sorry, this is principal Cheng am I disturbing you? - Waiyee, wake up! - What now... I need your help... Wake up! Remember principal Cheng... Chu's grade school principal? Listen to this: "Ll swung and swung..." "Faster and faster..." "Higher and higher" "at the highest point, I fell off" "I fell into a black hole" "papa opened his mouth and bit mama's head" wait... Continue "mama opened her mouth and bit me" no adjectives, no emotion, just action... The end section suggests long-term abuse guess who wrote this? Chu chung-tak? Shum chi-ling "grandma says, you see dead people in dreams” "papa and mama visit me in my dreams" "I cry but I'm happy" chu chung-tak? It's the writing of a second-grader but the feelings are genuine what else? I asked principal Cheng last time if she remembered shum she said no - this time? The student who provided the alibi for chu was... Shum, chi-ling she groomed him as a slave... Slave? Literally dominance and control is a key trait of the criminal personality they enslave and subjugate the weak and vulnerable I think it's time to conclude this mess It wasn't chul! His wife was behind it all! We know You're here Please recount how the accident happened he said he was in the scrap yard he was working away... When something big fell on him I was waiting for him outside I didn't see him come out so I went in stick it in, don't worry, it won't hurt... "London bridge is falling down" "falling down, falling down" "London bridge is falling down" "my fair lady" it'll feel good... yes, very good Look at me it's nothing, okay? Easy, it won't hurt don't pull your hands out, take it easy... It won't hurt... Don't worry... we're just playing wait... it's for not real... I was kidding... It won't hurt... Aaaah... it hurts...! Hush... go back to sleep... that's right... I heard someone screaming for help it was chung-tak! He was lying there, covered in blood my hands were bloody... No time for an ambulance, so I drove him to the hospital did his boss ask him to stay? How would I know? But you knew he was in the scrap yard? My husband didn't come home... So I looked for him everywhere! Doctor the tissue damage is too far gone we may not be able to save his hands will he be permanently disabled? Very likely what are we going to do now? I'm blind, he's crippled... If there's no infection, he can be released next week Did you bring the forms? Aaaah... it hurts... ill you're on painkillers, it shouldn't hurt... Oops! I'm so clumsy sorry are you mocking us disabled people? - I'll ask them to send a new one - No need this is our claim adjuster, Mr. chiang couldn't you just chop off a finger? I would have let it slide but both hands? That's going too far! Watch your mouth next time you'll take his life? You just received a payout for your child and you're back already? They won't compensate you if they find anything suspicious - you have evidence? - No but if you want to contest, take us to court it could take many months I hope your friends at the casino can wait Sign this termination letter now I'll forget about your child's compensation Think it over Hey! You don't smoke? - No smoking here - It's not lit! You're smoking more lately I'm back in detective mode think she killed professor kam too? 100% yes then you'd better be careful are you comparing me to that bookworm? Should we call the police? In a few days... After I compile enough evidence she won't get her payout let's wait and see I need to smoke "After what happened to prof. Kam, be on guard. Stay at the school. Avoid going out..." Brokers have no future even the boss is becoming an agent will you follow him to the new firm? After this chu's case, I was thinking of quitting... Really? I'll order a goodbye cake! Chiang said it would take 3 days, 3 days ago so anytime now I'll tell boss you accept his offer no... I plan to quit the insurance business but why? But your positivity balances out my cynicism I don't see the point of selling insurance you do what you need to survive you scam people, they scam you it's only fair I'm beginning to see how... "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" finally "Did you see the word "slave"?" "Maybe it's related to the dominance and control thing we discussed?" "Finished your paper? Congratulations! I'll come pick you up?" - Hello? - 999 emergency call center a killer is in my house! Send someone quick... My girlfriend has the only other key I'm sure she's been kidnapped! She's in sheung shui...
