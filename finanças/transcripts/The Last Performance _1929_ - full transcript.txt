THE LAST PERFORMANCE Directed by Paul Fejos (The Twelve Swords - Adaptation for Denmark) This is a strange report... on hypnotism, sorcery, and a trunk with twelve sharp swords. We are about to embark ... On an ocean of mysticism and passion ... in a small, leaky boat. "Flowers for Julie Fergeron, Erik the Great." The stage is set for Erik the Great. Now I'll show you an example ... of the strange and unfathomable power ... of hypnotism. "That's it, ladies and gentlemen." "Berlin, 1926. For Julie, my assistant, partner and dear friend. Perhaps someday she will be something more. Erik." "Prague, 1929. To my dear Julie, my fianc?e. Erik" "When you come to Paris ... speak to my agent there. He will arrange ... for your U.S. tour. Yours, Will Herman." We will have our honeymoon in North America. In two months, Julie will turn 18. Sometimes I feel as if my love was only a dream. "What do you want? I haven't called." "You can go, young one, but the next time you want to visit ... use the door." "Should I fire him, Julie?" "If it makes you happy, I will hire him as Buffo's assistant." A few weeks later, in Paris ... End of Act III. "This is the American manager. He will only be a moment." "I wired Mr. Herman ... telling him to accept the conditions." "Why are you always outside Erik's door? Are you in love?" "Julie, we are going to America." "Did you know that Julie is getting married to Erik in two weeks?" "Erik, the fool, believes she loves him, but I know better." "You're just jealous!" "True friends are rare. Will you stay with me." "Finally, the time has come. This afternoon we will celebrate Julie's birthday ... and announce our engagement." And so the party was held. "We owe so much to him, Mark. We have to go." "Friends, I now present Julie Fergeron." "Master, wait! There is a trick that you must see! You will never forget!" "Come on, Maestro! Use your magical powers!" "So even the great Erik can make a mistake." "My friends, I promised a surprise ..." "Let's make a toast to the future union of Julie and Mark Royce." "I thought Erik was in love with her." He understood everything. He forgave everything." I wish you well, Julie ... all the good you deserve." Erik spoke seriously ... or ... "If he mentions Julie's name again I'll kill him." "My assistant, Mark Royce ... Will now perform the big act, the great sword-trick." "BLOOD!" "It was he!" The sensational murder came before the court ... and the struggle for Mark's life took many turns. "Erik, is there any way to help? "Erik, I've always trusted you. Save him. Do it for me." "Your Honor, perhaps I should be ... the witness in this matter." "Your Honor, I would like to demonstrate the trick with the swords ... as it was done on stage the other night?" "It would be very unusual ... but in the interest of justice, let him." "Your Honor, I need someone to ... take the place of the late ... in the trunk." "Julie, don't!" "We can trust Erik with my safety." "BLOOD!" "This is a simple trick, Your Honor. The blood is mine." "I murdered the late Buffo Black, Your Honor, and I threw the suspicion on Mark Royce ..." "Because I thought, if it was Mark, Julie would come back to me ..." "I have nothing to live for. I committed murder, Your Honor, and I will pay for it." "That's it, ladies and gentlemen!" END
