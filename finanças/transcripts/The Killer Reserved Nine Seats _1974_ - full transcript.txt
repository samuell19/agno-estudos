- Did you bring the keys to the theatre? - Here they are. Is everything alright? What is it, dear? Darling, I don't understand why you never want to come here. - I find this place magnificent. - I don't like it. It's cold and sad. Isn't that right, Albert? - I prefer to be alone, sir. - Thank you, Albert. You can go back to bed. I'll lock up and leave the keys by the gate. I really don't understand you. You're a barbarian, Patrick. You own a beautiful theatre but you keep it always closed. After your marriage you could persuade him to reopen it, Kim... Then you'd have a stage all for yourself, and could act as much as you like. We'll all applaud you. Isn't that what you've always wanted? This might be the chance you've always been dreaming of. Your big chance - the only one you might ever get to be the lead. Come, let's go. What a charming place... I told you it's foolish to leave the party to come here at this hour. You're always the same, Albert. Go back if you want. I'll find someone else to take me home. You always forget that I'm the only one who works around here. I really hope I'll never need you as a doctor, Albert. Are we going to stay out here all night or shall we go inside? - I don't like this place. I'm afraid. - Stay close to Rebecca. She'll protect you. Patrick, for how long has the theatre been closed? I don't think anyone can answer that. It's been centuries. The last performance here must have been at least 100 years ago. But our family has always kept the place in order. Come in. I'll try and find the lights. It's so dark... Watch your step. You've been here before? Not right here, but I've been in this building. You know that, so it's pointless to ask. You just can't forget him, can you? It's up to you to make me forget. Pat, have you found the lights? - Not yet... - I found this. What's the point? It's more romantic in the dark. Darkness won't be necessary anymore, Patrick is already in her net. When are you getting married? - In two weeks. - That's very soon. My love is so strong that I can't wait any longer. I must be his soon. Very soon. You seem quite loaded this evening. - How much have you taken? - Thus speaks the great painter. The new Picasso goes on the attack as a red-blooded cavalier... - ...to protect his damsel in distress. - But Kim isn't his damsel. She's father's woman, or am I mistaken? You're not mistaken. However, Russell doesn't like the stuff. He only appreciates people who become wrecks by drinking alcohol. - He's old-fashioned, you must forgive him. - You need forgiveness more than me. Try to remember that you are still my guests. - Why don't you ever come here? - The building belongs only to Patrick. He inherited it. - The nicest things are his. - He's the first-born male in the family. For our father, I didn't really exist. It's all wrong. You do all the administrating. Patrick doesn't even notice. That's not fair. When you're close to me... ...nothing else matters. - The lights almost hurt my eyes. - How beautiful. Truly wonderful. - There will be no darkness from now on. - The fuse box is in there? - I forgot about that. - Yes, it's in there. It wasn't easy to find. It's as if you've been here before. You move around like it's your home. That's true. I once spent a night here. - When? - To be precise... - ...100 years ago. Well, you can show us around then. I can tell you what's behind this door. Come on, let's shout. Let's fill it with voices. Catch up on lost time. Old theatre, we've come to wake you up. To wipe away the dust that covers you. You old spirits that slept for centuries, arise. Let us hear your voices. Your masters have returned. Spirits don't have masters. - They're free. - Of course, I'm a free spirit. I can fly. Enter into these mortal beings and make them mine completely. They will have to do whatever I wish. - Right, daddy? - I'd be happy to do whatever you wish. Come and see. It's more beautiful up here. And leave these fools alone. I've known Lynn for so long but I always find her so different. Perhaps you never paid her enough attention. If I'm not mistaken... - ...your eyes were on someone else. - How sweet... Given that you only care about money, you think that everyone else is like you. I'm sure Vivian loves Patrick very much. You are too biased to say things the others could find sincere. It could also be said about you that you're more in love with Patrick's money than himself. You think so? But there's a big difference: I'm succeeding. Considering that we're getting married. What I like about all of you is your unbridled kindness... ...which makes you tear each other to pieces. - We're a very close family. - I'm not a part of the family. I'm neither rich nor noble enough. Perhaps you hope to be? I'd like to remind you that we've come here to visit the theatre. By the way, Patrick, is there a plan? I don't know... If there is, it'll be in the library. I'll go and see. Come on, Doris. You're not very talkative tonight. Doesn't your mistress allow it? There's something I've always disliked about you, Russell: You're never funny, you're only stupid. One day or another I'll try to seduce you. If you're still capable. And now, the long awaited play can finally start. Come here. I've longed for this for hours. Just seeing you from afar makes me insane. You have to be patient. We'll always find a way to be together. But this is absurd, Russell. If this is the price we have to pay for Patrick's money, I'll pass on it. I want you. I can't stay away from you. I have to take advantage of any moment to be alone with you. I'm just waiting in the shadows. It's the same for me as well, you know that. When we're with the others I can sense how much you hate them. I can sense that you'd kill them to have me. I could kill you. Could you do it while we're making love? We must have the strength to wait, then we'll have everything. What fascinates me the most about you, Russell... ...is that you're a scoundrel. I could give you everything, except trust. When we're together, I always feel in danger. But I like it. It's like knowing that every moment could be the last. What's wrong, Doris? There. Over there. - There's a man. - They're only mannequins. He moved, I saw it. But there's no one here. So many things that were thrown away, it feels dead. Yes, but I get the impression that there's something still alive here. I'm sorry if I frightened you, Vivian. This place has a strange effect on me. We're always afraid of things we don't know. You're not frightened? Nothing happens by chance. Everything that happens - ...remember that - has already been decided. It's incredible how everything has been conserved basically intact. Only the dust reminds you that this theatre has been abandoned for so long. It must've been beautiful once. Why don't you persuade Patrick to reopen it? It would be very difficult. He doesn't even want to talk about it. It's as if he's afraid of this place. But I'm sure you could persuade him. You're so beautiful, and you know it. Just try, you'll make it. It won't be easy to resist you. How long has Russell been your lover? Don't be afraid. I'll never tell Patrick. Who told you these things? You and Russell have been lovers for three years. Since before you met Patrick. And you still are. You have a great imagination. Or are these the words of our dear Rebecca? There's no difference between Rebecca and me, we're very close. So I'm the abnormal one because I like men. Look how beautiful it is. I could almost try it on. Why not? Put it on. It must be an Elizabethan dress. It's marvellous? Nobody kills without a motive. Do you think it would be hard to find a valid one for each one of you? What would mine be, for example? You might hate me because Kim left you for me. She was your lover. Patrick, you don't know me if you think I could kill for love. Perhaps it would be more convenient for Russell if you were alive. You're the only one who buys his paintings. And with whose money did you open your luxurious clinic... ...that's only good for dying in? I believe it was an accident, Patrick. Ultimately, we all care about your health. It's better if you're well. We all live off your money. - Someone would have more after my death. - Are you talking about me, father? Lynn, you know that someone tried to kill me a few minutes ago. It was pure chance that I got away unharmed. Perhaps your father is referring to me? I have neither scruples nor blood ties... ...and your money would be very useful for me. However, ever since we entered this theatre, Lynn and I have been together. So you either think Lynn is my accomplice, or you have to absolve me as well. - Your family doesn't stop with Lynn. - Rebecca and I don't get on so well... - ...but I don't think that Rebecca... - That Rebecca could kill you? Well, Rebecca would do a lot more than committing a simple crime to have it all. Sure, once I'm out of the way, she could do whatever she wants. So let's include Rebecca as well... ...but you're very quick to accuse others. I think that even your delicate hands are capable of cutting a rope. - Didn't you say there must be a motive? - And you don't have one? - I bet Lynn would find one straight away. - That's easy. You weren't too happy when your wedding with father went up in smoke. That was over a year ago. May I remind you that Vivian is now my wife? I don't think she earned very much in the exchange. - Insolent. - Why? It's over, Pat. This has absolutely nothing to do with it. And it doesn't concern you. I could never hurt you. Perhaps you already have without knowing it. And you, Albert, perhaps you just can't forget... - ...and want to take revenge. - And for what? I know very well what happened between you two. - You owe me a lot of money. - Right. But your death wouldn't solve a thing. Your relatives would jump all over me without pity - worse than you. We forgot someone. The man wearing the Nehru-jacket. Pat, what is his name? - I have no idea. - We thought he was your new friend. - None of us knows him. - I never saw him before tonight. Rebecca must have invited him. Strange... Nobody's seen him since we came in here. The first thing I would do after I tried to kill someone... ...would definitely be to escape. That would be the wrong move. Because everyone would immediately suspect you. For how long have you been there? Long enough to hear most of your discussion. - Where were you... - During your attempted murder? I was around. - Without an alibi or witnesses. - We've found our man. - It was him. - Doing what? Someone cut that rope in order to crush me with that beam. It had been cut. I had a good look at it. - I can't be mistaken. - You tried to play the role of the victim. You can do what you want, but I'm sick of being in here. I bet you've finished the bottle. I can be whatever you want, but I'm not a sewer rat. And I need fresh air. Have fun and be careful since accidents can happen to anyone... ...not just Patrick. O comfortable friar, where is my lord? Where is my Romeo? Go, get thee hence... ...for I will not away. What's here? A cup... ...closed in my true love's hand? Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end: O churl. Drunk all... ...and left no friendly drop to help me after? I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on them... ...to make me die with a restorative. Thy lips are warm. Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger. This is thy sheath. There rust... ...and let me die. You've never acted so well. You were wonderful. - We better not move her. - I don't want Kim to stay here. It doesn't matter to her anymore. But for the police it's very important that nothing is touched. First me, then Kim. Why her of all people? - Rebecca, call the police. - We shouldn't have come here... It's this place that calls the dead. It was one of us who killed her. Even if I don't know why. You've hated each other for so long that you don't even remember why. Perhaps it's broken. We must notify the caretaker. Or I'll go to the village and call the police from there. It's no use trying to escape. The phone isn't broken, the wires were cut. What? Whoever killed Kim cut the wires so we can't call for help. If he did, it was a wrong move. It's useless. It was closed before as well. I looked for the keys but they're gone. Maybe Patrick took them. You're right. It was the killer who locked us in. - We'll all end up like rats. - I hope that you're the next victim. - I'm just trying to boost the morale. - What's going on? The telephone is broken and the door is locked. - You should have the keys. - I left them right over there. - They aren't there anymore. - I'm sure I put them there. - They weren't there before. - Before when? - I wanted to leave. - Tried to escape? That was before Kim was dead. What matters is that we're locked in here. Wait a moment, there must be another set of keys in the drawer. The caretaker has two sets. Did you find them? Let's try the other doors. They're all locked. Listen, I want to get out of here. I don't want to die. You brought us here, so get us out. - You brought us here to die. - Vivian, please. Vivian, calm down. There must be a logical explanation. There's nothing supernatural here. - Hence... - So why can't we open the doors? Why? Let go of me. You. You have the keys. Open the doors then. Open them. There's someone in there. - It's coming from the stage. - But there's only Kim, and she's dead. Come here... ...and let us teach you how to cry. I told you many just things during your infancy. But you couldn't understand. That's why now, my dear nephew... ...you must pour a small drop of your tender spring. Sweet Mother Nature demands it. Stop your whining, my suffering friends. Pronounce the sentence against the fiend who caused so much disgrace. May he be buried in the ground up to his chest... ...and be left there, dying of hunger and desperation... ...begging for forgiveness. That's our verdict. Why can't the wrath express itself? Why is the rage silent? I'm not a child regretting his faults with craven confessions. I would commit 10,000 more - even worse - ...if I could do as I please. And if I ever did something good in my life... ...I now regret it from the bottom of my soul. Who are they? - What do they want from us? - Quiet. Some loyal friend please take the king away... ...and give him a decent burial in our family crypt. And concerning this ferocious tiger... ...there won't be a funeral. No one will be grieving. The bells won't toll when it will be buried. Throw it to the beasts and the birds of prey. It led a beastly and undesired existence. No one shall pity him. As for ourselves, we shall rearrange the state... ...so that such events can't ruin it anymore. Who are they? - What do they want from us? - Quiet. - It didn't record them. - Maybe it's broken. It recorded what Vivian said, but not these voices. We're trying to explain things that can't be explained. The telephone, the doors, and now these voices. The man with the Nehru-jacket? - He's disappeared again. - But who is he? - Rebecca invited him. - Me? I saw him for the first time tonight. He seemed to know this theatre, as if he'd been here before. But it's been closed for years. When we were at your house, Pat, at your party... ...whose idea was it to come here? I don't remember. Lynn, perhaps? It was that very man who talked to me about the theatre. Yes, he also said something else. That he hadn't been here for some time and that he wanted to return. We must look for him. He holds the key to this mystery. What do you think? I'm afraid, like all of you. You know something we don't. - I don't know that man. - I'm not talking about him but the theatre. Why hasn't it been used for so long? There's a legend. It says that 100 years ago, a group of people met in this theatre after a party. They were locked in for a few days... - ...and when the doors were finally opened... - The doors were locked as well? ...they were all dead. I think that's it. I don't remember well. How did they die? I don't know. Perhaps they never found out. What can we do? Tell me. I can help you. You know, I'm sorry for what happened between us... I can't forget it. It's too late now. Perhaps not. Maybe none of us will get out of here alive. When the doors are opened again, we'll all be dead. What are you saying? What are you thinking about? - What's today's date? - February the 15th, your birthday. Now I remember the date of the events that happened 100 years ago. It was also February the 15th. Albert. What are you doing? Open the door. I know you're in there. I want to talk to you. Open the door, I said. It was you who killed Kim. It's useless, I saw you. I saw you running away from the stage. Open the door. Listen... ...I won't tell the others. I won't tell them you're the murderer. I promise you that. All I ask is that you help me in return. I'm begging you. I don't want to blackmail you, but let me go. Help me get out of here. But... who is this? Why are you doing this to me? My God... There's no one here.... Rebecca, it's you. - What's going on? Someone wanted to kill me. He ran after me... ...and wanted to disfigure me with a cigarette, to burn my face. - Believe me.... - Where? In there. He chased me to the stage. Who yelled? What happened? No idea. Sounded like a woman. We just arrived. - Vivian was attacked. - By whom? I don't know. He had a black cloak, a dagger and a mask on his face. - But where did you see him? - He chased me to the stage. Then he caught me and pushed me onto the bed. It was Russell who saved me. He saw him and stopped him. Russell? Where is he now? Sorry, but I don't understand... He didn't say anything? He didn't do anything that revealed his identity? No, nothing. There's no one here. I think Vivian just saw a shadow. Kim wasn't killed by a shadow. Can you tell if it was a man or a woman? Perhaps by the way he walked for example? - Or by his eyes? You must've seen them. - No, I told you I didn't. - There's nothing we can do. - Couldn't he have killed himself? In theory, yes. But the bruises and his clothes show that there was a struggle with somebody. Besides, why should he commit suicide? Out of remorse. Perhaps it was him who killed Kim. Kim was engaged to Patrick... ...but before that, she had a relationship with Russell. And perhaps it wasn't completely over... You expect us to believe in a fairy tale? It is incredible. It is irrational. But the coincidences are too extraordinary to be casual. Look. This perfectly represents Kim's death. The second one shows a woman being threatened. And the third one seems evident: A hanging. It's a man who has been hanged like Russell. This is a very old parchment. It's at least 500 years old. But it describes everything that's going on here. Tonight. And what do you think is happening? What's the meaning of this story? We are living a story that has already happened before. A woman who's been stabbed, a man who's been hanged. But the second picture shows a screaming woman, threatened by a dagger. He didn't have a dagger in his hand, it was a lit cigarette. 500 years ago, they didn't have cigarettes. So Vivian isn't your threatened woman. We're all losing our minds here. Where did she go? I haven't seen her. Rebecca, stay here. Don't move. Let her go. As long as we're all in here, there's no danger for her. Yes, but the next victim... Look. You're talking a lot of rubbish. Or are you trying to confuse us? The killer is one of us. And we have to find out who it is before it's too late. All this can be explained very simply. Some electronic system could lock the doors without a key. And a disconnected telephone means absolutely nothing. The mysterious voices we heard could've been recorded. Right, but my tape recorder didn't record them. I don't believe in the supernatural, but this is a fact. It's only a fact if your tape recorder was switched on. We only have your word on that. - For what it's worth? - You could also be wrong. Yes, sir, but you're annoying me. This doesn't solve a thing. Come on. Stop. Where are you going? How do you explain the man wearing the Nehru-jacket? You know something? There's a portrait of him in the other room. I haven't seen it. There is an 18th century painting in there. Yes, a portrait of a gentleman from the 1700s. But it was here. You're still in shock. No, I saw it. I'm sure it was him. This painting is from the 1700s, as you said... ...but how could it have been a portrait of a man who was with us a moment ago? - Perhaps he isn't a man. - He is a man. And he's hiding here somewhere. - I'm certain he's the killer's accomplice. - So am I. - Why shouldn't he be the killer? - We all said that we don't know him. He can't have any interest in killing total strangers. If your theory is right, the killer must be someone who knows this theatre well. This is my point. Someone who has been here before to prepare the place. The tricks. Me. All of them could get into this building. You as well. And also Albert. Everyone. But Albert has a clear idea. Don't you? Evidently... But I can't prove it. And who tried to kill me in that case? - You stay here. - Let go of me. Doris, are you there? Let go of me. You? Who are you? Answer me. Patrick, who are you talking to? To... to him. What are you talking about? He was here. I'm sure of it. I saw him. - What are you talking about? - It was the man with the Nehru-jacket. He called me. He smiled at me. Vivian, you must have seen him. Right? You saw him as well. He was right there. You had a hallucination. Or you were confused. Nothing else. So... ...I'm insane. I'm insane. Perhaps Albert is right... I'm the killer. Only I could know the theatre so well... - ...and prepare everything. - Nobody believed what Albert said. Nobody. But I'm afraid it's the truth. I don't remember anything. It's as if there are empty spaces in my mind. I want to know what happened in those moments. Come on, Patrick. Let's go away from here. Someone tried to kill you as soon as we came here. And it wasn't a ghost. Ghosts can't kill. If we stay here, we'll all end up dead or go mad. I swear... ...the only person here I'm not afraid of is you. What if you're wrong to put so much trust in me? That wouldn't be so bad. My life isn't worth much after what happened last year. Why do you talk like that, Vivian? It's absurd. You never told me why you broke off our engagement. But I knew. Because of a series of anonymous letters and photographs... ...that showed you in detail what I am. A very liberated woman... Too liberated to be my wife. You can say a call girl, or a whore if you want it more expressively. - Vivian... - It was all true, of course. I really loved you. You don't know how much I hesitated before calling it off. I really loved you as well. Seriously. But in your circles, a woman could be a lesbian or a slut - ...it's even considered a pleasant eccentricity - ...but she mustn't ask for money. It's the rule of the game. Why do you want to talk about this? - I always hoped I could avoid it. - Why? Because the time has come to tell you something: Your anonymous informer... ...was your trusted doctor and dear friend Albert. Albert stood always behind me, even though he was part of your world. He even married me to avoid losing me. Albert... He wanted to keep me close to him at any cost. He hated you, and he continues to hate you... ...because he knows that I can't forget you. Him as well... He also has a reason to kill me. Him more than anyone else. Because I still love you, Patrick. Now more than ever before. A magnificent cardiac arrest. My poor grandfather was 89 when he died. But your brother ended up in a mental home. Yes, I think so. Chronic alcoholism. It happens in the best of families. An old noble family without an alcoholic in the wings... ...ought to be declassified. Patrick also spent some months in a clinic when he was young. Did you know that? Listen, doctor, if you're insinuating that my father is mad... - ...then you're the insane one. - I'm not insinuating anything. - But I'm sure that Patrick was sick. - It was only nervous strain. My father is an extremely lucid and rational person. His only defect is to surround himself with whores and false friends. Everyone in this group. It's no surprise if one of them is a killer. - Listen well, my girl... - You listen to me, doctor. We've had enough. If you want to play Sherlock Holmes... ...find another audience. Understand? - Where's Rebecca? - Look for Doris and you'll find Rebecca. It's a simple problem. I can't do it, Duncan. Not tonight. I'm afraid. Why not? This is a good night for it. But Kim and Russell are dead. Someone must've killed them. Russell first killed Kim, and then he committed suicide. This has nothing to do with us. Calm down. Nothing else is going to happen. Stop it, Lynn. Stop it. I said, it's enough. Enough. This time, the killer left his calling card. But it's mine. I lost it when we came in here. I searched everywhere, but couldn't find it. - Or Rebecca pulled it off of you. - But no. I had nothing to do with it, I was with Patrick. When? Do you know precisely when they were killed? Well, no. But why don't you believe me? I had nothing to do with it. You've all gone insane. I had nothing to do with it. - I had nothing to do with it. - Stop. It wasn't her, Duncan. It wasn't any of us, don't you understand? - Bullshit. Ghosts don't kill. - But we're in their hands. - In half an hour we'll be free. - How? You'll see. Help me. Don't leave me alone. I'm afraid. Wait. Look. I've been shaking for two hours. Why didn't you give me some before? You'd taken too many. That's not enough. Give me another one. What are you doing, Lynn? Nothing's happened, Patrick. It's all some sort of dream. I've had other ones like this. - What have you taken? - Nothing. Just some tiny pills. What matters is that everything that's happened... ...is just a dream. No one's locked us up in here. No one's dead. And you're not my father. While we're on this journey we're all as free as the air. Isn't that right, Patrick? Surprise. I gave you a fright? What is this nonsense all about? - What is that costume? - What it is? It's one of the many tricks someone organised here for tonight. I found it in the corridor, near the stage. And I wasn't the only one having fun, there was someone else who was serious. Who's to say that you weren't the serious one? - You're the only one. - Lynn can tell you. I've always been with her. The man who tried to disfigure me with the cigarette was wearing it. But it wasn't me. If I really wanted to kill you, I could've done it earlier... ...instead of dancing around you like an Indian. My God... I thought I would die of fear. He's just irresponsible, high on drugs. But I don't think he's the killer. The solution to what's happening here doesn't lie in any of us. It's in the words of the man with the Nehru-jacket. They aren't words without a meaning. They're an account of everything that's happened here in this building. Now I remember what the servants said when I was a boy... ...and what they thought I wouldn't understand. They said that one of my ancestors, many, many centuries ago... ...was a prince, a feudal lord. They said... ...he knew that everyone close to him at his court... ...wanted him dead for one reason or another. So he threw a feast in his palace. In this one. He killed them all, one by one... Nobody knows what happened that night... ...but some sort of curse fell upon my family. Exactly every 100 years, on the same day... ...the same events would occur exactly as they happened before. But it's only a legend, Patrick. Don't you see that it's happening all over again? My God... I look dead as well. What are you doing? Take that costume off. You're frightening me. Don't look at me like that. I didn't want this... It was me. I killed them all. I don't know how... I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't even remember afterwards. Help me, Lynn. It wasn't me who killed them, but the man with the Nehru-jacket. It was him who guided my hand. Believe me. Only you can save me. This time it's done. We were lucky the beam didn't hit him the first time round. He used this opportunity to kill off all the others. So there aren't even any witnesses. We'll finally inherit everything and can do whatever we want. Not yet. We're still locked in. The doors are closed. Sure. Do you think I haven't thought of that? Come on. I broke the lock. Just a push and... It's not possible. It's a curse. It's a curse. No. No. I want to get out of here. - Take me away from here. - Stop it. - Stop it. Lynn... - Take me away from here. I want to get out of here. Look, let's go back. I'm afraid, Duncan. To be trapped again in that blasted theatre? We're going underground. So, every 100 years, he kills them all one by one... ...saving only his daughter because he loves her. But not as a father, as a lover. And it was her who carried inside her womb the seed of that love... ...to kill her father. But upon the daughter and her progeny, a curse fell once every 100 years... ...which will endure until the intervention and the love of another woman... ...will put an end to that incest. Only in that moment, the guilty seed will disappear from the Earth... ...and the curse will end. I don't want to die.
