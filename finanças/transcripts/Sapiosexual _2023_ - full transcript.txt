- Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. Oh, take me upstairs. What? What? Why'd you stop? Liam, what? - Nothing. - No, what? What's wrong? - Nothing. Nothing. - Liam- - Nothing! - Liam! - Absolutely nothing. - What happened? - You don't get it. Don't you understand? - No, everything's fine. What's wrong? - This has never happened before. - What are you talking about? - Oh, come on! - What? - Nothing is happening. - Well, but I mean, it's- - Look, I'm under a lot, look, stop it! I'm under a lot of pressure. - Well, but it's okay, then, you know- - Hannah, would you stop it? Goddamn it! - But it's okay- - I don't give a damn. - Where are you going? - I'm going to hell. - Liam, this is crazy. This is ridiculous. You okay? Hey, all good? It's okay. Okay? What? What? Are you okay? Do you want me to wait downstairs, maybe? - Yes. Wait downstairs. - I'm gonna just, I'm gonna get my boots, and I'll, I'll wait for you downstairs, okay? - Get your boots. - Do you, do you want me to make you some tea? Or, or, or, or get you some wine, or something like that? - I think you can answer that question yourself. If you don't know what I want by now, you'll never know. - Okay. Sorry. - Yeah, you should be. - He flipped a switch. I'd never seen him like that before. He was like this person that I'd never even met. - You know um, maybe you wanna, maybe you wanna talk to someone about it, you know? - I beg your pardon? - I'm just saying, I don't know. I was just trying to help. - Would you like for me to pour you your own glass? - Nah, I like yours. - You know, I've been thinking. Maybe you might want to join one of those dating apps. - Are you kidding me? - Why would I kid? I don't want you to be lonely. - I'm fine, really. I've got a very full life. I'm good. - Are you? - Mm hm. - Why don't we go get some fresh air? Let's take a walk. - I think that sounds like a fabulous idea. - I think you're gonna like Freddie. He's a very intelligent guy. His book, little bit scandalous by my taste. But you know writers. - What time does he arrive? - Said he'd be here by dinner. You know, when he called the other day, I thought he'd be the perfect addition to our celebration. - Celebration? - What? - I don't know, just seems kind of silly. I mean, dramatic maybe. - Okay. Not at all. I think we're setting an example for others. - Others? What others? No one even knew that we were together. See, that's where it gets a little strange. This really doesn't have to be some big uncoupling event. - Well, I just thought it'd be a nice way to wrap it up. - Wrap it up. - And what would you call it? - This is your choice, so you can call it whatever you want. - Oh God, I thought we weren't gonna go there. - What? - Animosity. You knew what you were getting into when we started. - I did, but... - What? - I don't know. I mean, you know, no matter how many rules get laid out at the beginning of anything, we're still human. - My wife! No, no, she's been there before and she's bounced back. - You can only bounce back from cancer so many times. - Oh. - Oh, come on. Now that she's on her deathbed, you're gonna get sentimental? - You knew I was never gonna leave my wife. - Did I? - Hannah... - Did I, did I know? - Of course you did. Right from the start. You knew I was never gonna leave my wife. - You never said that. - Well, listen to me. We had a wonderful moment, way back when, long ago. But we never made closure, and we need closure. Oh, Hannah, I thought about you constantly through these years. Every time I look at my children, I wonder what would they be like if you had been their mother? On vacations, it was torture. I just pictured us there together. But my wife has been a good partner. She's devoted everything to her. I owe her. - Being with me didn't exactly make you the doting husband, did it? - Oh, good. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. What? - No, I think, um, I think you're right. I think you're right. You know what? Why don't we just go and check on that amazing stew you made, okay? - No more? Okay? - I will be as sweet as candy, Liam. - Good. Do you remember the first time I brought you here? Three years ago. - Yeah. Three years ago. I remember it very well. You're so funny. I missed your humor. Wow. - Mi casa. - This is fabulous. Oh, this is lovely. - Got a little dining area. - Oh, little. - Up there. - Great dinner. - I'll show you the den a little bit later, but I wanna show you my pride and joy, my kitchen. - Oh, so nice. And so pretty. - Just a little country kitchen, that's all. - A little country kitchen. Hardly. - No, I know what you mean. And the funny thing is, Nancy never comes here anymore. - Oh, that's a shame. Why don't you guys just sell it? You'd get a lot of money. - I like to have a getaway. - Get away from her? - Yes, I like to get away from Nancy. - Oh, well, what does she think you're doing when you're here? - Writing. - Writing what? - My novel. - Oh, that's cool. What, do you have a title yet? - Yes. "Son of the Narcissist." - Wait a second. Isn't that the same one you were working on when I was in high school? - Busted. - That's a really long time to be writing the same thing. - Well, how did you expect me to finish? I needed my muse. You're my muse. I can't finish without my muse. Sex and creativity, they go hand in hand. - Liam, um, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey, stop. I, I just don't, I, I thought we were just gonna come here and you were gonna show me your country house, and we were gonna have some coffee and have a nice chat. Right? That's what we were gonna do. - And that's that we're doing. - Yeah, no, but I, I really, do you really think it's such a good idea to start again? - Absolutely. - No, Liam, Liam, Liam, it took me years to get over you. - I know that. - No, you don't know. It took me years. It was so hard. It was so hard. I went through so much. - That's behind us now. Here we are. It's the now. And we're together. - I just, I-I just, I-I-I-I think, I mean, I don't, I really, I don't know. - Hannah. - No. - Hannah. - What? - Listen to me. - Hmm? - You know you want me. And I want you. I just want to make you feel... - But I, I really don't know if this is such a good idea, Liam. I really don't know. You are absolutely right, you know. I think this is gonna be so, so good to just get this wrapped up. - It must be Freddie. Why don't you go let him in? Hannah, let your hair down. - Hi. - Hi. - You must be Hannah. - Freddie? - Yes. - Come in. - Thank you. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - So, welcome to the party. - Thank you. - Should I help you with your coat? - Oh, yes, please. - Hannah, is that him? - One for each of you. - Oh, how lovely. - Hannah? - Thank you so much. - Is it Freddie? - Uh, yeah, yeah. Uh, he's in the kitchen. Do you wanna follow me? - Sure, thank you. - Okay, great. - Liam? Hey, Freddie's here. - Freddie. Great to see you again. - You too. It's been a while. - Yes, it has, hasn't it? Quite a while. - Freddie brought me a signed copy. - Really? - Yeah. - I brought one for you, as well. - Look. - Thank you, all right. Yeah. I'm good. I read the reviews. Well, I must tell you, I am really thrilled about having you two here today for this celebration. - The concept is fantastic. - Yeah, the concept. - I think our dear Miss Hannah is somewhat of a sore loser tonight, hmm? - I don't think so at all. I think I have a different way of looking at things. Every ending is the start of new beginnings, you know? One door closes, another opens. I always win in the end. I am going to go and have a nice look at my brand new book. I think you guys should just catch up, okay? All righty. - Apparently she has some issues to deal with from early adulthood. It'll be okay. - Uh, I dunno. - What don't you know? - I mean, this feels a little awkward. Are you sure you want me to be here? - Absolutely. - I mean, we didn't exactly part on good terms, you and I. - Well, it's all the more reason to have you here for this celebration. Look, why don't you just go join Hannah right now, and she knows where everything is. You guys can set the table and I'll just tend to the stew. - Sure. - Hey. Congratulations, Freddie. - Thank you. - It took a lot of courage. - Yeah, it's presented as fiction. - Yeah, but you know the truth. - I do. - Massive storm tonight. - I know. - Really shouldn't drive in it. - No, I shouldn't. - Mm. You know, um, there's a guest bedroom if you're interested. - He wants us to set the table. - Oh God, what a control freak. Of course he does. Well, I guess, you know, we could do what he wants. - Now. - Yeah, for now. Let's do it, come on. - Drink, please. - Mm, I'm good. - You can't expect me to enjoy this all by myself now, can you? Well, you like wine, don't you? - Of course. You taught me all about wine, remember? - Yes, I did, didn't I? - You taught me many things. - Yes, I did. Many things. - So, Freddie, are you working on a new novel? - Ah, yes. Yes, I am. - Can you tell us what it's about? - I could, but then I'd have to kill you both. So, Liam tells me you're a therapist, Hannah. - Yes, I am. - What inspired you to choose that path? - Um, in my twenties, I had some really bad things happen, and had some issues come up from it, and became suicidal. - Twenty-something girls are always so melodramatic. - I'm so sorry. - I'm not, actually, I'm really glad it happened because it put me on a path where I had to get a ton of therapy, and it just inspired this thing in me that made me wanna return the favor to the world and try to help others who were damaged. - Oh, come on. Isn't that just like saying that you refuse to take responsibility, that it's easier to blame other people for your actions? - No, I don't agree at all. I think what it is is taking full responsibility for any trauma that comes into our life and realizing that it's about the way we react to it. That's, that's the thing that gives us back our power. - So interesting. - Right? I mean, think about it. You know, if everything is all caught up inside of you, and you're all, you know, playing the victim, and wanting to blame other people and everything else, that keeps you stuck in almost depression, where if you take action, that's when you become the victor. That's when you seize your life and manifest your own destiny, you know? - Yes. - Yeah. - That's actually what inspired me to write my novel. - Exactly, see? So you took something that was really negative, and you turned it into gold. - Yes. - Hmm. - Well, then I guess it is possible to shine a turd. - Oh, Liam, you are a turd. - Excuse me. Is this going to turn into a let's-blame-Liam-for-everything evening? - Sorry. - Excuse me? - No, I'm so sorry. - No, you're not sorry. Look, if you two are gonna behave like this, why don't we just call it an evening and you two can kindly leave. - Oh, Liam, Liam, we're grownups here. It's okay. Shh. It's okay. Everything's fine. Look, we're sorry, right Freddie? - Yes. - We're so sorry. - Won't happen again. - I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go make coffee and get some dessert. How's that? - Perfect. - Great. And I didn't even start drinking yet. Oh, Liam. - Thank you, my dear. - Mm hm, sure. - So how long have you two been...? - Three years, give or take. - Oh, but you knew each other before? - Oh, yeah. Her real mom had passed away and her father remarried, and, well, I spent some time with the family one Christmas, and over dinner one night, I noticed there was a spark between Hannah and myself, and, well, one thing led to another and, we became romantically involved. - So, wait. Her father remarried your ex? - Yeah, yeah. - How old was she when? - Seventeen. - Seventeen? - Mm hm. - Jesus. Did anyone find out? - Oh, no. - Your ex? - No, we were, we were discreet about it. It was a unique romance. And uh- - But wait, wait, wait. You said you spent time with them over Christmas, so this all happened in their house? - Yeah. - Jesus. - Yeah, yeah, carried on for quite some time, right through the summer before she went off to New York to attend NYU. I missed her. So I took a place in New York and we kept going. - Wow. I had no idea. - How could you? You hardly know her. - No, you're right. I don't, I just... Sorry, I guess it's all a little bit shocking. Learning all kinds of interesting things about you tonight. - Stick around, the best is yet to come. - Right. - Why don't you go help Hannah in the kitchen? - Okay, I'm just gonna clear the table. - Knock yourself out, buddy. - Fucker can't get a normal French press or something. - Making coffee? - Well, I hope I'm making coffee. I can't get this dumb thing to work. Yeah, I mean, there's only so much wine in a human being can drink, don't you think? - Unless you're Liam. - Got that right. I give up. - So how bad is his wife? Nancy? - Yeah, that's her name. - Is it terminal? - Um, I'm not sure. I mean, I've actually never met her. That would be kinda awkward, don't you think? I can guarantee you one thing. That chick is not going anywhere. She's got enough money, she can go and get the most expensive alternative treatments, and stem cells, everything. She'll go to Mexico with a suitcase filled with cash, and she'll like, stay there at some spa and get healed. Yeah. - Kinda got that from the stories. - Yeah, I mean, think about it. Think about Liam and who he is. He wouldn't hook up with anyone for life unless there was something in it massively for him. And probably financially. Look at this place. You think a professor could afford something like this? Really? No. - He was just telling me your story, how you met. - Really? Yeah, I was pretty stupid and young, you know? - Was it force? I mean... - No, not really. I mean, it was, it was strange. See, I was, I was a bad girl. I was a brat in high school, like really bad, and kind of a rebel. Wore Doc Martens, little emo, dark eyeliner. And the guys in high school, they were a little too innocent for me, even though, I mean, I wasn't getting with anybody. But then Liam comes along, and he's in my house, and kind of a family friend, and he's this grownup, really smart, and attractive, and alluring, and all that stuff. And I just was so excited by the fact that he was actually paying attention to me and he wanted to talk to me. And he seemed so into me, and I was just so turned on by the fact that, you know, whatever. And I think there was also this thing of me wanting to get back at my dad, or my stepmom, but who knows? I mean, I was 17, you know. How can you figure out a 17-year-old girl's brain. Fucked up. - I was his assistant. You know how close we were. I mean- - Yeah. - You heard. I just thought he, I just thought he was the most amazing, alluring, interesting person I'd ever met. But there's that thing he's got, you know, I don't believe he feels things the way others do. Like there's some piece missing, something deep inside. Maybe that's the mysterious part that makes him so fascinating. I don't know. I guess that's why I had to write the book. Just that feeling that I got when I was around him, it just stuck with me. Made me want to dissect it, rip it apart, and understand it. - Kinda like a serial killer. - Not quite. - Oh, come on, it's okay. You can, oh, so a little bit? Just a little teeny bit? It's okay. I won't tell anyone. - Are you okay? - What do you mean? - I just feel like maybe you, you're not ready. Not like this. - I'm ready for the next part of my life. Seriously. Here, could you take these in? - Jesus! - I know. - Liam portions. - Yes. And this, so he loves chocolate-covered almonds, but these are special ones that I brought from Manhattan. I mean, like, don't you have one of these. - Oh. - Okay? Oh, what's that for? - Just wanted to do it; I don't know. - I know. Liam, I can't get your damn coffee maker to work. I'm gonna make tea, okay? Fucker. So why sapio? - It's about a sapiosexual, when people are attracted to each other for intellectual stimulation. - Ah, yes. - I like it. - Liam, did you ever finish your novel? Sorry, is that a bad topic? - No, he um, he-he never did. It's the, um, it's the same one he was working on when I met him when I was a teenager. - My life got in the way. - Nothing should get in the way of art, of creating. - Oh, really? How about supporting oneself? Having a successful career as a professor, raising children, being a husband? Do you ever consider that maybe those little obstacles might have hindered my progress? - It sounds like a lot of excuses. - Excuse me? - Not trying to start a fight. I just know that if someone has a story inside of them that needs to be told, bottling it up can end up harming others. - That's ridiculous. - No, it's not. I think that your general angst and your need to seduce people that you deem beneath you is directly related to your inability to expel this creation from your being. - Really? You seem to have a lot of judgments about me. - Not at all. I have no judgment. I just know that if you don't get this out of you, it will fester inside. Writing "Sapio" helped me come to terms with what happened to me. It doesn't bother me anymore. - Whoa! What happened to you? You, you seem to make it sound like what happened to you was so horrific. Well, if I remember correctly, my dear lad, you were more than motivated at the time. - I was young. I was fascinated by you. I thought it was so exciting how you'd lived in Asia, and you'd traveled, and were so cultured and intelligent. - I was. And I'm not now? - That's not what I meant and you know it. - Oh, really? Got a lot of judgements about me, don't you? Yeah. Why did you come here today? - What? - Why did you come here tonight? What do you want? Why did you call me? - Liam, look, Liam. It's, it's all good. We're just talking here, really. - Oh, it seems to me you were just sitting there, and weren't saying anything. You were just listening. - Well, I have nothing to say about what happened between you and Freddie. - Oh, the therapist has no comment regarding his accusations. - Accusations? - Yes, accusations. You seem to be implying that there was some sort of rape involved. - No, I didn't. - Oh, really? Then why did you write a book about that? - It's fiction is not verbatim as reality happened. - Oh, then why didn't you let the public know that? Why? I don't have to. Oh, you mean to make you feel better? - Liam, Liam, I think Freddie might have a point. You know, you have this moment where everything in your life is getting wrapped up, you know? Your kids are all grown up. You and I are getting all finished up here. You and Freddie are having this amazing meeting of minds. I mean, this is the turning point for you, really. You have the ability to do anything you want in your life right now. And think about it. Your book is called "Son of a Narcissist." You know, finally coming to terms with this and getting this story out of you and into the world could be the single most healing thing you ever do for yourself. - Really? That's interesting. - I'll get the next bottle. - Okay, I've had a little bit too much. I think I'm gonna go to the bathroom. - I'll bring some candles in. Found these on the counter. - I keep 'em ready in case. Power's always going out here. - I'll bring this into Hannah, - Mm hm. - I bring you light. - Yes, you do. - I definitely don't think I can drive in this storm. - I don't either. It's so dangerous. - Excuse me, but I have to take a piss. Let me have this light so I don't pee all over myself. - Good luck with that, Liam. - Let me lead the way. - Yes, please do. - God, I hope that wasn't too awkward. How long do these outages usually last? - Not long. Power's usually up by morning. - Hopefully. - Okay. - Okay. - Hello, welcome to Liam's. - So I don't think he even saw us. - I don't think so either. - Oh, wow. This storm is really nice. - There he is. - This storm is great! - Isn't it beautiful, Liam? - My Bluetooth speaker's perfect for this. I think it has about six hours of charge on it. - Oh no, does it mean you can dance for six hours? Wow, look at you go. My goodness, Liam. - All right. Oh, my eyes. - Whoa! Oh my goodness. Goodness gracious. - Now we have a Hannah sandwich. - Oh Liam, I'm not a teenager anymore. Not by a long shot. - We could pretend. Freddie, my dear man. What, pray tell, are you drinking? - Oh, I switched to vodka. Wine gives me a headache. - And vodka doesn't? - Nope. - Really? Live and learn. - Oh, so I was talking to Freddie, and I convinced him to stay the night. - Hmm? - Yeah, I mean, he could stay in the guest room, right? - I don't want to impose, of course. - Not at all. I have an idea. Freddie, you like to dance? - What? - You like to dance. - Be careful. - Yeah, come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. Up, up, up! - You're serious. - What? - I am serious. - Ugh. - Come on, up. Join him, come on! He can't dance alone. - You didn't even ask me if I like to dance. - Well, come on, you know. You know the rules. You know the drill. Let's go, let's dance. Oh, come on now, dance. No kidding around. This is serious. Put your arms around each other. Oh, yes. - This is weird. - This is ridiculous. - Oh, oh yeah. - Stop laughing, this is not a joke. - Thought it was. - Freddie, this is not a joke. Come on, now dance. - We are. - Yeah, yeah, Freddie, put your hands, put your hands on her hips. Yes. Yes, look at her. Hannah? Hannah? - What are you doing? Really? I mean, this is getting kind of weird now. - Shh, shh! It's not; it's beautiful. - Jessica, look into her. Come on. - Come on, what do you want? - I want you to see that you want each other. Look at him! - What are you trying to do, Liam? - I'm trying to get you to see that you want each other. Don't you get it? Look at her. Beautiful. Freddie? - I did not expect anything like this to- - Kiss her. - What? - Kiss her. Goddamn it, kiss her! - My God, relax. It's fine. - Is it all right? - Do you want play this game or not? - This is a game? - Yes. It's Liam Says. Liam, go on. - No, no! Go on, kiss her. - Okay. - Nice. That's nice. - This is getting really weird. - Freddie. - We did. - Kiss her. - No, what? This is like torture. What are you doing? - What do you mean torture? You wanna talk- - Liam. - Don't. Don't, Freddie. I just wanted you to see that it's all exciting. I'm not wrong. It wasn't wrong then, and not wrong now. It doesn't matter. Age, male, female. It's connection. To pretend that some one person's desires are wrong and the other's is right, you're not allowing the human spirit to fly to its full potential! - It's okay, look, look, we're okay. We're okay. All good. - Hold him. Hold him. - Okay. I don't know what he's gonna do. - Oh, yeah, yeah. - What are you gonna do? I don't know. I don't know. Sorry. - Whoa! Whoa, hold it, hold it! Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it. Stop it! - What, I thought that's you wanted? - No, no, no. - That's what you wanted. - That's not the way it should be, no! - What? - Don't; it's not right. It's just not right. It's always been about both parties. What both parties want. You wanted me as much as I wanted you. And same with Freddie and myself. - I've come to believe that sexuality is more broad than people like to admit. And I also don't think that any same-sex interaction means anything in particular. We're attracted to minds, to individuals, you know? Not necessarily about male, female, that sort of thing. So I understand what you're saying, Liam. - You know, actually, I, I think two men together is really exciting. - Really? - I've never admitted that to anyone. - How about two women together? - What about it? - Do you find that enticing? - I find many things enticing. - What stops you? - Who says I stop myself? - Hmm. I've come to find you very uptight and inhibited. Hmm. That's interesting. Because that's just the way I behave around you. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, I am different with every person. I take my lead off whatever it is that I'm getting from the other. - Oh, that sounds a little bit sociopathic. - Maybe. I guess maybe we're all a little bit on the spectrum. - Yes, I think we all have a little bit of sociopath in each of us. - Mm-hm. - Have you ever... - What? - What, Liam? - Have you ever...? - Come on. - Hey, I think I saw somebody. - What? - Look. - What are you talking about? - Liam, that's creepy. - It's just us, Liam. It's just the three of us. - I think we got him. - Really? - Yeah, I think we did. - We better, because I'm not doing this ever again. I think it's gonna be a long time. - Yeah, whatever you gave him is fucking weird. - I had no idea. - He was acting so weird. - Oh my gosh, he was crazy. - What the fuck? - I don't know. I was getting scared. - I know. - On that note, I'm getting a shower. - I think that's a good idea. - You're welcome to join me. - I absolutely will. - Me too. - Thanks. I'll deal with that thing, okay? And then I'll meet you down there. Charlie, Charlie, hey. Thank you so much. Thank you. Come on, I'll take you to the front door. - Hey, you Freddie? - Yes. You are? - I'm Charlie. - Charlie, nice to meet you. - You too. - Thanks for doing this. - Yeah, sure. - You sure you're up for it? - Absolutely. I've been friends with Hannah forever. - All right, perfect. Let's go. - Let's go. - Hi. - Hi. - Yeah, it's okay. Hi! , you look fabulous. - You look great. Go on up the stairs, and it's the first door on the right, okay? Hey. - It's wonderful to see you. - Oh, it's so good to see you. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Let me take your coat off. It's done. I gave the guy the money, and then he took an Uber. - He's good? - Yeah. - Me too. - We're only halfway there. - We can't stop now. - We can. - Do you want to? Neither of us have what we should have had in life. This will help make it okay. - Won't we be just like him, then? - No, we'll never be like him. - For real? - For real. - I've got the coffee maker working. Do you want some? - Yes, please. - I got one for you already. Here you go. How do they look? - Thank you. Pretty damning. - On your right. Ooh, my God, it's good. That's great. - Can't believe he's still asleep. - Yeah. - Glad the power came back. - It always does. - Hannah? Freddie? - Down here. - Make sure I'll take a shot. - Oh, so that's where my robe went. Can't believe you two are up already. - We've been up for hours. - So you drank a lot, huh? - Yes. - Mm hm. As usual. - Coffee? Please? - Yes. - Oh, man. Crazy night last night, huh? - Yes. - Fantastic, though. - Think so? - Why wouldn't I? - I don't know, it was kind of uh... - Scandalous? - Well, it's not the word I was looking for, but yeah. More like unexpected. - Good one. - Whoa. - Make sure you drink that coffee up. I left it black. Give you lot of energy. You're gonna need it. - Don't tell me we're gonna do it again. I don't think so. You're pretty quiet this morning, my friend. - Yes. - Guilty? - Excuse me? - You're feeling guilty. - No, actually, not even the slightest bit. - Hey, what's, what's going on with you two? Huh? - What, did you two slink off and fuck all night? - We didn't slink off. - Amazing how someone so intelligent can be so crass at times, don't you think? - Absolutely. - All right, all right, all right. What, you're acting like a couple of teenagers. What the hell is going on here? - How funny is that? Teenagers. Considering that's his favorite type of lay. - Oh, all right, Hannah. We said we weren't gonna to go here again. - Oh, don't worry, Liam. Last time. Never again. - Last time, never again. Well, let's just get this over with then. All right? - You said you wanted to wrap it up. No problem. - Wrap it up. I wanna get it over with. - Liam, I'm gonna take a shower. I wanna be outta here by noon time, so be ready, all right? - I can give you a ride back to the city, no problem. - Oh, that would be, you know what, there's this amazing place I really wanna show you- - Hey, excuse me. Excuse me! - I really wanna show you- - Excuse me, is this not a language I speak? Did you hear me? - Jesus Christ, yes, we heard you. We're planning our exit. - And after this morning,, you will never see or hear from either of us ever again. I can assure you that. Hurry up. Lovely to spend some quality time together before we go. You hungry? - Yes, starving. - Bacon, sausage? - Bacon, please. - Okay. Definitely put that one in, okay? - Yes. - This is the final thing. You have to confront these people, you know? - Yeah. - Even if we don't get anything. - We will. - I gotta thank you guys for last night. You made me feel like a young man again. A moment I'll cherish forever. - Liam, Freddie and I have known each other a long time. - 15 Years, actually. - What the fuck are you... - Right after Freddie left as your assistant, he started coming to see me. As you know, I specialize in victims of sexual predators. - Liam's his name. - Liam.? What's his last name? - Morris. - How long ago was it now? - Two years. It was two years before you said his name. - That's right, two years. It took two years before I revealed who it was. - That opened you up into what you have love? - That's what you call it. - Well, what do you call it? - Taking advantage of someone beneath you. - Ah, don't be ridiculous. I only had the best of intentions for you. - Did you? It seems to me, after hearing more of the story with Hannah, that this is your thing. - Don't be ridiculous. - You seduced her while she was in high school. - She was, what are you talking about? She was living with my ex. - Your ex was her stepmother. It's just so pedo. - I-I was just 13 years older than her. That's normal in those places. - Not when it's in her parents' house, and their bedroom is down the hall. - Oh, she wanted it! - I was a teenager. Teenagers want all sorts of things. If I wanted crack or heroin, would you have just given it to me? - Oh, please. - Would anybody? Of course not. - Wait a second. I think there's a little bit too much judging going on around here, and not enough dealing with reality. - I think the reality is perfectly clear. - Well, let me tell you something. You think you know me? You don't know me. You write one novel about our relationship, and then you try to fabricate it and call it fiction. And you think whole world has to know. No. You were trying to come on to me. - I was your assistant. We were friends. - All right, all right. Well, you certainly seemed to try hard to make me think that you wanted more. - I did no such thing. - No? Come on. All the little innuendos, touching my shoulder, gazing into my eyes. - You are imagining things. - Oh, am I? - What are you saying then? - I'm saying you're nothing but a con artist. Yeah, you're just a con artist. You openly talk to me about bisexuality. - Because... - Because? - Because I was young, I was confused. - I think not. It was more than that. - What? - It was more than that. You were trying to manipulate me. Yeah. So that I would help you professionally. - That is absurd. - Oh, it doesn't matter now. You have your bestselling novel, and all this other bologna, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. - You're jealous, aren't you? - No, I'm disgusted. - No, you're jealous because I actually did something. I took a chance, and you just stayed on the safe path. Typical marriage, typical job, typical routine. Never did a damn thing to make your life special. Not until you started your little fling with the girl whose virginity you stole in her parents' house! - I know your type. You're nothing but a little street hustler. You hit hard. You lie your way into anyone's life to get what you want. You use your words now, your words to convince people to send the other thing. You weaken them so you can crush them. Well, guess what, buster, it ain't gonna work with me. - Really? - Really. - Seems to me it already did. - Oh, really? - Show him. - Sit down, Liam. Sit down. - You're gonna wanna listen to her. - Here, check it out. See this? I don't think Nancy's gonna like me these too much, huh? - I agree, Hannah. - That's the kind of thing that gets someone served divorce papers virtually overnight. - And usually the woman would cut a guy off from funds if it's her money and all. - Indeed. Very true, Freddie. - But, there's a way to make everything right. - You two are disgusting. Both of you. - We're just two damaged people trying to protect the world from a sociopathic narcissist. - You set me up. So-so who does that make the real sociopath, huh? How dare either of you judge me? - Doesn't matter what I dare. - You need to pay us off, both of us. - Oh no. N-never. Get out! - Hmm, you know, it's amazing. Your internet is really excellent, here. Look at this. I can get this zipped file sent to Nancy in, geez, like seconds. Isn't that incredible? - Yeah, with the speed of technology, she could probably have the divorce papers drafted before you even finish the drive back to Manhattan. - What do you want? - What did we talk about? Wasn't it everything? Yeah, everything. - No, no, you, give me a number. - She already said everything. She meant it. - Look, you took away the innocence of both of us. I mean, who knows how many others, right? I was never able to have any normal relationships after you got done with me. You took away everything from me. I was barely drinking age by the time you got done. You know, did you know that you left me with an STD? I've never been able to have children, and I'll never have children, and it's all because of you. - I didn't know. - Hmm, yeah, of course you didn't. - And you took advantage of a young, confused assistant. It took years of therapy to even begin to fix my shame and self-loathing. One way or another, it's time to wrap this up. - Hm, yeah. He likes those words, doesn't he? Let's see what we got here. Yeah, I think right about here. Look. Here you go. - How the fuck did you get that? - Hmm, I have my ways. - You need to transfer everything from the special account your wife set up for you and give it to us. 50/50 split between myself and Hannah. - If you have access to my account, then why didn't you just do it yourself? - See, I'm a different kind of person. I actually wanted your permission before I violated you. - Well, you, you have to leave me something. - You give us everything, and Nancy doesn't find out. - Yeah. - You can rebuild and just live the rest of your days off your wealthy wife. And when she dies, your inheritance. - Or we could send her the zipped file and you're on your own. Doesn't sound like her or her family would take to all your dalliances, and whatnot, you know? - Here, all you have to do is press this one button. I set it all up for you. It's really easy. Do it. Come on, Liam. Just get it over with. Don't be a little pussy. Thank you. He did it, wow. Impressive. All right. Ready? I think we're out of here. Ready, Freddie? - Ready. Smile, Liam. You're done with us for good. - Oh my God. I could have stopped him. I could've saved you. I'm so sorry. - What did, what? What? - I knew him. - What? - I'm so sorry. I should've stopped him. I should've stopped him. I'm so sorry. I know exactly how you feel. I know. The same thing happened to me for years and years. Isn't this beautiful? - Oh, it's gorgeous. - I love it here. Springtime is definitely my favorite season. - Yeah. Season of new beginnings and opportunities. - Very true, yeah. - Thank you for meeting me here. - Yeah, well it took a little convincing. I have to tell you, I have never, ever gone outside my office with a client. - Ah. - Not even for coffee. - Really? - Yeah, really. - Fruits of the forbidden tree. - I suppose you can call it whatever you want, but it's true. I keep very, very clear lines. - I hope it's not making you too uncomfortable. I didn't mean that. - No, I don't feel uncomfortable. But I just, you know, I'm a little hypersensitive after my whole experience with Liam, you know? - Understandable. - I mean, kinda young. - Well, that whole experience is what made me feel like I could trust you. - Hmm. - You just see me the way no one has. - Hm, it's true. We do share that. - Yes. Fortunately or unfortunately. - Yeah. - Not sure yet. - Yeah. Do you wanna maybe have dinner tomorrow night? - I'd love that. - I know this great place by my office in the city. - All right. What time? - Like, 6:00? - Sounds perfect. - I can't stay out too late. I have a client early the next morning. - Right. - But, okay. - School night. - Kind of. Yeah, you can call it that. Let me show you these over here. It's like a Miyazaki film. It's so gorgeous. - All right. - Do you know Miyazaki films? - I don't. - I'm gonna show you. - You'll have to show me sometime. - Yes, okay. So, do you think they even know we're here? - I don't know. - I mean, they gave us this bottle of wine at the bar. - Yeah. - And then they seated us. But I mean, we didn't even get menus or anything. - No. You would think that they would be a little more attentive. - A little. - Wait, that guy. Look at that guy. - What? - Wait, hey. Oh. - Nope. - He went to the kitchen. - Straight back to the kitchen. We are not his table. - Wow. I mean, did we do something wrong? Did we piss somebody off? - I don't think so. At least we have good company. - Yes, very much so. - I like your necklace, by the way. - Oh, thank you. It's moldavite. - It's what? - It's moldavite. It's actually from outer space. - Really? - This is actually part of a meteorite. It's really dark green. - Metals and- - Yeah, yeah. But the cool thing is like all stones have a certain power and an energetic kind of vibration. And this, trust me, it's true. But this one- - I'm not laughing, I promise. - Oh great, yes you are. But this one is actually known to transform the wearer. Like you put it on, and immediately like your life starts going crazy, and all these things happen, and it's pretty amazing, yeah. - It's not just placebo effects? - Maybe, but you know, I took it off once for like a year and life got really boring, so I put it back on. Yeah. Actually there's a place that I order from all the time. Japanese restaurant. Really great. They deliver on time, all the time, and my apartment's just like three blocks from here. And I mean, I don't wanna be like cheeky, or creepy, or anything, but you know, we could always go to my apartment and have some sushi. I could show you a Miyazaki film. You said you never saw one. - Yes. No, I haven't. - I mean, oh, you're missing out on massive stuff. - All right. - Cool. - Let's go. - I'm so glad we got to do this. - Me too. - This is so fun. - Me too. - You're unique. You're very special. - Thank you. So are you. - Thanks. All right, let's finish this, and then we're off. Beautiful view, isn't it? - Yes, it is. How are you feeling? - Different than I thought I would. You? - Yeah, same. - We did the right thing, right? - I think so. - Okay. Do you regret it? - No. - Good. - You? - Mm-mm. - I think we needed that more than we thought we did. - Hmm. Hopefully it's over. - Yeah, hopefully. I think we taught him a pretty good lesson, don't you? - I hope. I can only hope, really. I don't know if people are capable of changing, you know? - Yeah, who knows. - Yeah. We should go. I've actually got something to go to. - Right, okay. - Thanks for driving me back to the city. - No problem. - Appreciate it. - Wait, wait, don't you have another appointment? - Oh my gosh, what time is that? Oh crap. - Oh shit. - Oh my gosh. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. - It's a little unprofessional. Wait, your dress. - Thank you. - Okay, you're good. - I'm a mess now. - You know I have to do this. - I know. I think it's really good, actually. You know, it's a great idea. - Yeah, but as soon as I finish I'll be back. - I think you're gonna do great things. - Thank you. - You don't have to thank me. - No, this has changed my life. - Me too. - Now we know we're not broken. - We are very broken. We're very, very, very broken. But at least we're not alone, right? - Yes. All right. - You need your shoes. Yes, I do. - Yes. - You too. - I do. They make me look more professional. - Yes. - All right, talk to you soon, okay? - Okay. - When do I turn here? - Oh, about five or six more blocks down, I think. - Okay. How's the parking by where you live? - I don't know. I don't really, I almost never drive in the city. So, yeah. - I was just thinking maybe I could come up for a nightcap. - Oh, oh, I would love that. But I'm, I'm not going home. - Oh. - My patient, she's been texting me all weekend, so I just wanna like go and check on her and make sure that, you know, everything's okay. - Okay. - So you don't live around? - No, I live in Tribeca now. I used to live up here back when we used to- - Right. - You know, hang out before. You're gonna love my new place. - Yeah? - Oh yeah, definitely. - I'd love to see it. - Come over this week? - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah. - We can have dinner, or something. - Or something. Yeah, we'll figure something out. There's lots of good places down there. - Okay. - Yeah. You'll like them. You'll like 'em a lot better than that first place I took you. - They have waiters who'll actually pay attention to us? - Yes. - Yeah, okay. - Bonus. - Is it right here? - Uh, yeah, you can turn right here. Then we're gonna go up the West End. Thank you. I really appreciate it. - Of course, of course. - You're so sweet. - I hope there's nothing serious with your patient. - Hmm, yeah, me too. - Hope I wasn't keeping you from anything. - What? - No, nothing, I'm just... - What's keeping me from- - No, just hope she's okay. - Oh yeah, me too, me too. Who was keeping me from something? - Surely not me. - No. You are never an imposition. - Well, it was nice seeing you, even under the crazy circumstances. - Yeah. Yeah, interesting way to get back together after all these years. - Yes. - So this week we're gonna reel it in a little, okay? - All right. - Just me and you. No one else. No animals, nothing crazy, all right. - Okay. - Yeah, I think it's best to keep things simple. - I agree. - Yeah. - I got one right over here. - Okay. - Yeah, just pull over. - Right here? - Yeah. - Okay. - All right, so I'll talk to you? - Yes. - All right, I'll see you. - Okay, see you this week. - Definitely. Gimme a call. - Absolutely. - Careful. - Bye. - Nancy. - My wife. Nancy never comes here anymore. I like to get away from Nancy. - Is his wife, Nancy? - Yeah. I've actually never met her. That'd be kind of awkward, don't you think? - Is it done? - It's done. - Oh, fantastic. Fantastic. Oh, it's really over. - Yeah. I'm so glad you're so healthy. - How bad is his wife? Is it terminal? - My wife, she's been there before, and she's bounced back. - So healthy. - So healthy. If you want, I can um, I can wire you the money right away. No, seriously. - No, no, no. It would make me happy, and all I wanna do is make you happy. - You already did. - I know you have plenty of your own, but I just wanna give you everything. - I'm gonna go take a shower, okay? - Okay. - You have no idea what I've been through. - Oh God. Do I wanna know? - Mm, no. - All right, love. Come back to me. I miss you already. - I'll be so fast, so fast.
