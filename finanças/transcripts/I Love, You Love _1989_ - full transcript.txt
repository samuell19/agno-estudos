SLOVAK FILM presents I LOVE, YOU LOVE Story and Screenplay: Editor: Sound: Music: Cast: Production Manager: Director of Photography: Directed by: What happened then? I took her outside... And then? The music was playing. You couldn't see anything. Her body was so white... you should've seen it. The next day she pretended not to recognise me... You know. Have another. He's up. You're tough, aren't you? What did I buy it for? If you didn't drink for two days... Hang on, l'll give him some... Leave him alone! Look who's a strong chap! You must've grown. Let's measure up. I fancy that one. Hey, you guys, we're running late! What's taking you so long? Almost ready. Where's your friend? He went off to pee. Let me check your breath. How did it go? Nothing happened. She didn't want to? I wasjust curious what she looked like under her uniform. The inspector was here. I had to take a breath test. You think l'm in trouble? We'll think of something. What happened, Steve? I fell off the express. Where's Vince? Fell off the roof, did you say? Where's Vince? Did you hurt yourself? Why? You scared me. L'm OK. He wanted to marry her, but she wouldn't have him! The boss wants to see you. Were you drinking too? We don't drink on duty. When are you coming home? L'll be coming... Here you are... Move! You have to treat it like a woman... ...stroke it, caress it. Look. Bon voyage! Stop! Your wheels are turning! Mind the posts! It's me. How are you? My legs hurt. Did you miss me? Here I am again. Just like your father. Wait till l'm gone. What would I do without you? Where's the cat? Give it some water. §afio! Where is it? It's always wandering off. From one garden to another. Never comes home - like you. But it catches mice. Is it there? It's there now. Come on, try. Me first, then you. Your father taught birds to sing, too. The girls liked him. He had one for every finger. And you've got two for every finger in town. Go on, you swine! Am I pretty? L'm old and still pretty. Why've you put three plates out? He's coming today. Who? My husband. He gave me these. Mother, he's dead. Who are you? It's me, Steve. I don't know you. Oh yes, I know Ga§parl'k. That's him! You need some sleep. Have a rest. You'll sleep in the back, and we'll sleep together. What was I thinking of when I married you! Of a nice white wedding. All you do is drink all daylong. Whining again, are you? L'll give you some whining! You know what the doctor said. I can't work. I should go for walks in the woods. I should have married the butcher! I dressed in white all my life! AI! Our bees have flown away. A fine example you've picked for yourself! And that tomcat of yours is always around here. What am I supposed to do with all those kittens? Randy brute! Me? If it were you, I wouldn't mind. They're following the queen. She gets an idea, and off they all go. Just like my old lady. I guess she's jealous. I sweep the chimney for one, then another... They offer me a drink... Am I supposed to pour it down the drain, or what? L'd never be jealous. Where are the bees? What's u p, Steve? No drinking, no dancing, no loving. That's what I call work! She's the head and l'm the neck. I turn whichever way she wants. Yesterday I had a blonde. On the train. But I fancy someone else. She's the one I want. She used to be a beauty. Tits like balloons. And a body like a May flower. L'll jump on your back! People should be as sincere as animals. Animals are sincere, but people... just hoard up everything. Are you dru nk? You owe me. Me? If you're in debt, at least shut up. Took my garden, but they don't know how to plant anything. What's this you've got? A pressure chamber. To wash your pigs in? There's no sewer. It has to go in the ground. What happens when it fills up? It'll never fill up. Put in a valve and pipes and you can manure the whole garden. Underground. And a pressure gauge! There'll be two flushing Iavatories. L'm going to put neon lights all over this wall. All these rooms, and you'll sleep in the kitchen! Do you enjoy hunting for bricks? Haven't you anything better to do? It's for the children. L've nothing else to do, so I build. Come on, Steve. What about your wife, Rudy? She took the bedroom furniture and went to her mother's. She's not going to live here. This is mine! In my garden. They took our garden, and they haven't paid yet. That's your problem. L'll finish the house, and to hell with them all. Just go on building! Jealous, are you? Of you? What've you ever achieved? L've got nothing, and you've got everything! Why don't you build a house too? On debtors' lane? Never! If you've got money, the world is yours. Their bellies are full, but they've lost their souls. My pee is crystal clear. If I don't have a drink, it gets cloudy right away. L'll have to be going. She'll be waiting for me. Tonka! Let me in! What is it? It's me, Steve. What do you want? Don't you know? Go and get some sleep. Let me in. Like before. When? She's got someone in there again. They should isolate women on a desert island. She calls me Fero! L'd go with them. What are you so sad about? My bees have flown off. Cecilia, open! Cecilia and I, it's one long honeymoon. She says, kiss my ass, and I say kiss my ass... I can't lose. They know me at work. They like me. Only yesterday one girl said to me: kiss my ass. What about Papal's daughter? No one's going to tell me what to do. L'm doing all right. Who've you got in there, Steve? Where's Steve? He was herejust now. When he gets drunk, he wants to be on the top. He must be in the attic. Once we had white mice. What? I dropped a parcel, and there were mice on the ceiling. You don't believe me? Honest, they were running over the ceiling. Let's go to sleep. They were laboratory mice. Are you asleep, AI? Come and look! What? He's off again. Let him have a nice walk. Where are you off to? Go to bed. What are you dreaming about? Where've you been? I was looking for the cat. Can you hear the cats? He's some male. Were you asleep out there or not? You were asleep. Were you walking on the roof? They're getting it on... I wouldn't change this bed for anything. You've got a better one at Vera's. Do you want some more paprika? How about some beer? That one from the train's coming. Which one? The one you promised I could have for myself. She must be coming here. She is! She's all yours. Is Vince here? They told me... He's still... Can I ask you something? When someone starts something with me, I want to know where we're going. We don't even know each other yet. I play in a band. Dances, weddings - that sort of thing. You'd like to go steady, right? That's why I came. Is he serious about me? You've eaten his supper. He'll be upset. L'll come back later. You fool. I hide, and you... She came to see you. Me? Hi, what are you doing here? You were here all the time? L've just got here. L'vejust come out of the locker. I like to take a nap in there. Ask him. Who do you think you are? Wait! l'm coming too! L'll get you a date. Wait here! Vera's coming! Lock the door! Are you asleep? What should I tell her? It's all fixed. Just because you're a city slicker, you think... What are you doing here? I dropped my trousers. Where's Vince? Didn't he tell you? What? That I like you. You must be joking. Wait! That's for him as well! Have they announced number twenty-seven yet? Not yet. Is it delayed? I guess. Inhaling again? Wasn't it enough that they fired you from the railway? Unhook it! Everyone's standing around with their arms folded... l'd like to get her pregnant... Everyone's had her. All you have to do is this... What about this? We'll send it back. On the railway I had a girl in every station... Here today, somewhere else tomorrow... Geography is essential. When the earth moves beneath your feet you have to ride it. Are you a musician? What's this? Look out! Haven't been in trouble for a long time, right? Is he drunk? You've caught his eye. That's just what I need! Go and give her a push! Steve, do you think you could? Could what? Get off on her. Blockheadl Illiterate women! Did you know that a baby was born once and it had more ears than teeth? Really? Well, you're born with ears, but no teeth. E Crazy' What's up? She's lost her mind again. I put her to bed. You need something else. Go away! L've found a woman for you. What? You don't believe me? She's in the barn. Who is it? You'll like her. What's he doing here? He brought her. Is she single? Yes, but she doesn't want anyone to see her. What are you doing? She's shy. Is she undressed? You'll see. Shut the door! Where are you from, miss? From Slovakia. Do you know me? L've known you for a long time. Do you want to marry her? We'll be your best men. Don't you want me? Where are you off to? Lie down with her! Are you angry at me? We wanted to surprise you. Let me be! It's for the bees. You wanted a hive. Papal had it in his attic. Look at it. I need alive one like that. Let's be friends. Done! Who says it's done? I do. It's done when I say it is. You pig, you've been drinking again! Just wait till l'm gone! Going up again, are you? Thank goodness I drink. Where is my truth? Come on you cat, we will win. L'm a tiger. I need tiger love. Let the world laugh, l'm indomitable. They can beat me all they want, l'm still alive. Leave him alone, will you? A Slovak is never lucky. Mother, where've you put it? I think I would be better off without you. Where is it? Try my hand! I was born the same day as Lollobrigida. Same month, same year. She's a Taurus like me. L'm aVirgo. They have many ideals. What would you do if you met someone like her? What would I do... You have to surprise her. If she doesn't have nice legs, praise her hair. You come up to her... and do this... brush aside a hair or a speck of dirt... But what if there isn't anything? You do itjust the same. Never complain to them: I don't have any money, l'd like to be five-foot ten... Can I try? It's not something you lend. DO YOU pray at night? Why? You could pray for some booze. Watch your legs! That's what I call legs! Like on a piano. She's got legs like an old racehorse. What did you say? What did you say? Me? Nothing. Leave my legs alone! Show me! You should be so lucky! Your beloved's coming. Blockhead. Would you like some beer? I only like it with honey. I keep bees. l'll bring you some. Where are those bees of yours? In the garden. I watch them fly. I close my eyes, and fly with them. Once I banged my head. And now you're a blockhead? Aren't you afraid they'll sting you? I don't know. I breathe on them, and it drugs them. There was a time when I didn't drink for a week. They stung me till I swelled up. You're swollen because you drink. I had such a woman once, all the guys said hello to me. Not the way they treat you. But she left you. When I was your age they were all over me. Are you going home, Steve? Yes, but without you. Vince, are you up? Get up! Open! I know you're in there! What do you want? What are you doing in there? LN \ \ K \§x ! Open! Who's in there with you? Don't come in! Is she your wife? No. Why? Then what's she yelling about? What's that she's saying? You bastard! Let me go! Bastard! Leave her alone - do you hear? You told me this place was yours. What's she clone to you? Shut your mouth! Stop beating her! Do you want some, too? You can live here together! L've got a place of my own! Ididn't know... Get out of here! Thirty... l've got enough. Bad luck. And I don't want to go home. What's wrong with your ear? I won't say a bad word about you again. Don't tell anyone. Tonka clipped my ear. She's so bad-tempered. I can't stand it any longer. I saw her with Rudy. He kept making her promises. She thought she'd move into the new house with him. Diamonds! And he went back to his wife. Double. She's always yelling. Twenty. Forty. Take her, for a week at least. I don't want her - and you could do with a woman. PlaY- Be a man - you did want her, after all. What's past is past. You want me to go down on my knees? Let's go to the pub. Tonka_. Move! Come on, she's waiting. She hasn't even gone to work. She should have waited when she married that officer. Come on. Who's that you've brought? The old lady got lost. She didn't recognise me again. You didn't want to believe me. Who believeth not shall not be disappointed. This is our street. Our street? I got lost. We live here. L'm your son. I recognise this - but not you. He's a sleepwalker. I saw it. He walked up the wall like a fly. Then he fell in the manure. And there was a fly covered in manure, it flew around, and landed in the milk. There it is. Don't you want it? When's Vince coming? Have you quarrelled? Don't pretend you don't know. What are you doing in here? Can't you see l'm getting dressed? Forget about him. We'll find you a better man. Good-looking, with a kind heart. And five kids. Four. What's up? To hell with Vince. Do you think I was glad they fired me? Why are you telling me this? Would you like a drink? OK, I was with her. L'mjust lucky, that's all. Do you think I enjoy it? You said she'd be mine. What was I supposed to do? If you want her, she's yours! And Vera too. You like her, don't you? You should go and talk to her. You go. What are you staring at? Here are the keys. What do you say? Aren't they too big? Italians wear shoes like this. Or horses. You expect me to wear them in the village? It'sjust the little bit you're missing. You're missing something. We'll go out tonight - you'll learn. I don't think I want to. L'll find you such a woman you'll never forget me. - Even. - Odd. Even. I win. What am I to say to her? How does she like the music... Does she come here often... Tell her what a good dancer she is. Or say something in Italian. You have to lie with your body. Do you think she's tall? Tell me that bit in Italian. How do you like the music? Do you come here often? You're a good dancer. Bertha! What's that you've brought? It's from Vince. We can pay for our own vodka. I don't want to see him. Sometimes I imagine l'm rescuing you. You're rescuing me? From drowning. Resuscitation? Mouth to mouth! Shall we dance? Can you swim? No. Why don't you leave her alone? Men can do whatever they like. Come on, then. Vera, do you like brass bands? L'll come and play for you. Where did I put that key? You've got lovely shoes. Lend them to me! Vera, l'll bring you some honey. Honey? To put in your beer. Sure - bring me some! They're such a good match. The same from behind and matching from the front. Don't take it away! You've had enough. Enough,enough! Open! Stay in there, then! Make me some coffee! Make it yourself! Ask that whore of yours! Where's the coffee? Vince, Vince! This is not funny... What's going on? Do you feel better? I had a headache. I couldn't remember what shirt he was wearing. Shirt? That evening. I ironed all his shirts, but I couldn't remember that one. I don't want to live. L've brought you this. You killed him! Because you drank with him! She said I killed you. And you meant more to me than to her! I don't like you. Where's the other one? What now? Walk! You can't, can you? Go and find your mate, then! Tickets, please! Where are your shoes? I lost one, and threw the other one away. How are you going to walk home? Over the fields, and barefoot. I can't lose. You didn't want me. Vince isn't getting married? How is he? Fine. Did he go back to her? They made up. L'm going steady now. L'll give you something to wear. Steve! Two vodkas? One for your mate, too? Give him my regards. What've you done to me, my friend? Don't be afraid. L've got you inside me. Tonka! What do you want? Wouldn't that be nice? You just knock on the door and... like Rudy! Have you picked the plums yet? Two hundred kilos of them. They say if you eat plums you live longer. Is your mum leaving? What? She went to the station with a suitcase. Where are you off to? I ran away from him, too. From who? Whenever he came, he smashed the cupboard, and said: smile, Mary. I won't drink any more. You're only saying that. What would I do without you? You're the best in the world. You won't wander off any more, will you? I know what they say about me here. L'd like to be like a man. Use it and throw it away... I felt a twinge in my heart, I think l'm dying. Those who want to die live a long time. I still haven't met the right man. Mister Right? Friendly, pleasant... I don't care what he looks like. How much do we weigh together? Catch it, Vera! Pass it on! Doesn't want to go. He's gone crazy again. This one's heavier. What is it? Do you both have diarrhoea? Have you eaten something heavy? Yeah, really heavy. I knew a girl, she ate snow when she was pregnant. L've got some Hoffman's drops. You'll feel better. Now you're happy, now you're sad. Me? Sad? Why? He was cheating on me, anyway. Would you like to go to the cinema? Come with me. I have a rehearsal. L've got so many things going on... Rosie, Martha, Tonka, Milly... not Milly. One after the other. I can't even remember them. Vera and I are going out for a coffee. Ask her what she thinks of me. What? Forget it. I know she hates me. Aren't you coming? Women don't want me. I suppose they're afraid of me. The ones with hairy legs are passionate. And demanding... Come on, then. Go on! You have to, Steve. Are you waiting for someone? No. What about you? Do you have a date? No. Have you seenjerry? One can't even enjoy a coffee without someone trying to pick me up. A woman on her own... l'll put an ad in the paper. Maybe someone will reply. I wouldn't buy a pig in a poke. You never know what you're going to get. You should find someone, too. L've got a girlfriend at home. What about your bees? They're better off than people. They enjoy being alive. What if they have National Committees, too? Maybe they even publish ads. L'm no good at being alone.Just waiting... Change for a beer? How much? Don't you know how much a beer is? Let him have some fun. But he'll spend it all on drink! He has to drink. His hands would shake in the morning. Like yours. Do you trust a stranger from a pub? What are you talking to her for? You don't trust anyone. I have to go and see my son. I need money for the train. What are you doing here, you drunk? I don't drink any more. Since when? Since today. Where's your friend? I saw him to the station. Breathe on me. Have you had anything to eat? l've got some noodles. They all take advantage of you. I don't like this flat. I do night shifts, I can't sleep here. It's my fault he died. When he slept with her, I wanted him to die. I hated him back then. He drank. I hate drunks. We didn't even speak to each other. If l'd have made him coffee... Stir the noodles, will you? Steve, l'm expecting a baby. Maybe I don't even want it. Give it to me. Take it. L'll look after it for you. You and a bottle? Sometimes I talk to my son. I walk down the street with him... That's how I imagine it. How's your girlfriend? I haven't got a girlfriend. You're the only one I want. I want to be alone. Vince only used me as a mattress. He just came when he fancied... He loved you. He told me so, lots of times. And what about a little fellow like me? No one even notices me. L'm a nobody. Am I a nobody? L'd like to grow, but I can't. Come here. Now you - go on! A bird has to learn when it's young. Can you do that? Ah, well.Just eat, right? One more time! Every bird can learn to talk. Like a baby. Aren't you hungFY-7 It moved again. As if a fish were swimming around in there. There must be two of them. They're playing cards! Hey! What've you got? A red ace? He's got a trump card! When are you coming out? Don't want to? You're better off in there. l'll come in, too. Steve, are you there? Who've you got in there? When I was little, I walked in my sleep. I picked up a pillow and walked. An inch above the roof. Magic forces get you out of bed. The moon attracts you. My mother told me she should've killed me. She brought men home. What're you doing? Just don't go on the roof! Where's the cutlery? l've searched the whole house. That's mother again. l'll go and find her. Put it down! Here. Are you out of your mind? You should come for Mardi Gras. That's really something. People wear masks. You don't even need one. Steve does, too. Last year was my last time. lt's for bachelors. And for fools like him. Don't ever get married. Idon't drink. AI likes a drop of wine. Better than a mouthful of soot. Did you drown the other kittens? I couldn't do that. Hit them with the shovel and buried them. So you were a midwife? I helped all the women, except for myself. A man can only be happy without a woman. Why were you in such a hurry? You have to be, don't you? Where've you been the last two days? At my mum's. We were playing at a wedding. I went to your place. Your tuba was there! If you're going to drink, it's over. Wearing make-up again? You look like an owl. Are you my husband, or what? Look at yourself! Is this your comb? What's up with you? I had four hundred crowns here. Have you seen them? Talk about something else. You dream about him. You live with me, and think of him. Don't you? L've never played. All this time. There is no band. Do you want to try? Take your tuba and get out! Are you working? L'm on sick leave. Aren't you lucky? Take them! I am taking them. Has Steve been here? Sure. He sold me his tuba. Yesterday the police had to deal with him, he was so drunk. L'll find you a lovely man. He'll give you all his money, and a goose-down duvet. Mind your own business. You're like Kate and the devil. Shejumped on his back and wouldn't let go. And he's going to hell. Well, then giddyup! You know where you can go! I can't stand it any more. Does he drink, then? And how! He can't get his key in the lock. Things will get better. When l'm on my own, they will. He needs you. L've got what I wanted. Open up, I know you're in there! L'm not Ieavingjust like that! I won't give in! L'm not a loser! l'm a terrible man! Indomitable, I am. I have to win in this world! Aren't you going to speak to me? Just wait! Lost your tongue, have you? Now you'll see something. Do I have tojump? Do you love me? And will you talk to me? Yes! What's all the yelling about this time? One poisoned himself, another'sjumping off the roof. Stop fooling around! Who do you think you are? Climbing on the roof drunk. You should've jumped. Why didn't you jump, you drunk! How can I not drink? You keep thinking of him. Do you know who you're jealous of? He didn't want to work with you! He wanted to get rid of you, so he made you drink! He said he was fed up with you! How many men have you had? And you haven't had a single woman. Who'd want you? Vince wouldn't do that. He told me the baby wasn't his. He wasn't like that. I don't want to see you here again! Two vod kas? Just one. Your pal's not drinking? L'm not drinking. L'm the biggest idiot in the world. Well, so long, my friend. You weren't that bad, but you didn't care about me. Even. Odd. Iwin. Fill it up! What are you staring at? And you? Hunting for bricks? Building? How's the pressure chamber holding up? Spare change? Give me something! I know you. What about me? Will there be a wedding now? Get off! Come on! Spare some change! You too! The carnival season is almost over... Went to the pub again? The children cry: what are we going to eat? We'll manage. Done! Who says it's done? I do! It's done when I say it is. Done! THE END English subtitles edited by D. Shearman
