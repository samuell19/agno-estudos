Boss, it's time. So good to see you, Professor. I came to this meeting to say that there can be no compromise. What I need is not a compromise, but a new Egregor, at any cost, or we risk losing God forever. All because you led us into darkness. If you do not see God in the dark, that does not mean He is not there. Do not do this, Albert. War will cleanse the continent and give Christianity the power to rule for another 2,000 years. And the future will once more be shaped by our hands. This better be fucking good. What are you saying? Speak English. -Arthur? -Do I know you? It's me, Lesya. I thought I'd never hear from you again. My father committed suicide. What? There was a note to call this number. Have you spoken to him? Not for a while... no. So he didn't leave you a message, or something? Lesya, I'm sorry for your loss. Our loss, Arthur. I know how close you two were. Maybe, perhaps I shouldn't have called. Wait. There is a letter from Oryst. It's a ticket to Lviv. Really, for when? What else does it say? Nothing. Flight leaves this afternoon. Doesn't... I can't just get on a flight to Ukraine. Then I guess there's nothing more to say. Lesya... Egregor. Fuck. Fuck. Hi. Um, you speak English? I'm calling for Lesya. She has left. Do you want to leave a message? Yeah. Tell her my flight from New York arrives at noon tomorrow. Anything else? No, that's it. And who shall I say left this message? Detective Arthur Weiss. Don't worry, Mr. Weiss, we'll arrange someone to pick you up. Fly safe. Hey. Hey. You gotta go. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. What do God, Hawaii, and Count Dracula have in common? The first, ethereal, the second, a place, and the last a myth founded on a truth. Their commonality lies in our shaping and conception of them and how they in turn, shape and affect us. Now, what am I smoking, you may ask and where can you get some? Sadly, it's just an occasional Havana cigar, and they are readily found at any fine tobacconist. God would disapprove, I imagine. Though Count Dracula may be indifferent, so long as he is not caught smoking while sunbathing in Hawaii. We understand this logic because collectively, we have built tropes and accepted them. But what does this nonsense mean to our lives, to our happiness and success or even to God, for that matter? Egregor, is the energy essence or spirit of a place or group. And can be created and shaped by the people inhabiting it... who in turn are affected by and re-affect that Egregor. Like a loop. We forge our own bogieman... ...of power, fed to them by the belief that it has always existed there or through the act of imagining it so. New York feels like New York because the people there are influenced by the Egregor of New York. And they, in turn feed back into that loop. Willing to or no. What power could be wielded if Egregors could be harnessed to influence societies. If these Egregor's could be controlled... is that not playing God itself? The ultimate Egregor. What then is left of free will? That's me, Arthur Weiss. You speak English? All right. So what's the deal, did Lesya send you? Really don't talk much, do you? Where exactly are we going? Hotel or something? Charming spot for a hotel. Why did we stop? I guess I should have taken a cab. Why are you here, detective Weiss? Speak. Your voice... It was you on the phone when I called. Where's Lesya? You know very well, Mr. Weiss. that is not how this works. I ask the questions, so speak. Howdy, partner. You will talk. Oh. Welcome to Ukraine. Lesya? Time to go. Now. What the hell is going on? I don't know. Fuck. - How'd you find me? - I followed from the airport. I was hoping you'd come. Right. Well, nice car. -Discreet. -It's a rental. Awesome. They didn't have it in pink? Throw in any perks? An upgrade, air freshener? -Mints... -If don't like it you can get out back to that woman. No, I'll stay. Thank you. Where are we going? I could use a drink. Someone tried to kill me today. Yeah... We showed them. You really have no idea what's going on, do you? No. I rushed here from Kiev. Found out on Facebook that my father committed suicide. Of course, I didn't believe it. But, when I got to his apartment, the cops were searching it. Your number and the key to this apartment were in his safe. Luckily, they hadn't found it yet. So how about that drink? I'd kill for a coffee right now. Or something stronger. So you still, uh, teaching at the university, like Professor Oryst? No, I left all that. I train dogs now. I gave one to my father and someone chopped its head off. Fuck. Who was that? A friend of my father, the professor. We're going to his place now. Lesya... Maybe Oryst wouldn't want you to leave the apartment. When I see him, I will ask his permission. Move. Shouldn't we call the police or something? The policewoman at my father's apartment was the one that just tried to kill us. My father is alive. Let's go. Still drinking? Only when I'm thirsty. It's Lesya. Professor Melnick works in the field of animal anatomy. Right. Shit. What? Don't come in. -It's him. -Don't touch anything. We have to go. Go. That's uh, Latin, right? What does it mean? We watch towards eternity. My father's suicide note said the same thing. Lesya, where are you going? To find answers. Wait. The house is being watched. I know another way. Follow me. Let's go. Careful. What happened here? They were looking for something. But did they find it? Whoa. Cynocephaly... men with dogs heads. They appear across many different religions. Yeah? Which ones? All of them. Even Christianity. Some claim they were Christ's secret army sent by God. Find anything? Yeah. Look. Help me. Christ surrounded by cynocephaly. Why is it here? Time to go. Lesya... Come on. Fucking welcome to Ukraine. Might need this. Yeah. Seeing how it's going. Let's get the hell out of here. So you're a cop? Detective. Was... until they put me on leave. I was, um... aiming at a perp. Shot a civilian. Like some bad cop show. More like a scary movie. Yeah. Last time I saw Oryst was five years ago in New York. Barely had time to meet. My father always said you reminded him of himself. So... focused. Hmm. We hadn't really talked in years. Suddenly he just cut off all ties. Like a knife cutting me out of his life. Thanks for coming. For being here. You know... you've changed. You're even more beautiful than before. That's new? Got it after you left. Lesya and the detective went to the professor's apartment. They found the icon. Good. Then in time, Lesya will fall into our hands. For this is the Lord's will. History always repeats itself, Tiko. The Catholic Church will sacrifice its servant... just as Christ was sacrificed in our ancestor's past. The assassination will take place during the secretary's prayer. Everything is prepared. Cynocephaly, warriors of Christ. What did they have to do with your father and that Professor Melnick? It doesn't make any sense. Former student of my father's. She worked as his assistant. Do you think she knows something? I think she knows everything. Arthur. Oryst told me so much about you. It's nice to meet you, Maria. Tea, Coffee? Coffee would be great, thanks. If it's not too much trouble. What are you talking about? You do look like him. Right. What do you know about this? That's from the Kiev Psalter of the 14th century. And this? A symbol of the Cynocephaly's order. It's time you find out who you are. What did she tell you before? Nonsense. Something about blood. She has a photo of me. This couldn't get any weirder. Arthur! Took his time. Wasn't worried about getting caught. My father and Professor Melnick had the same ring. Lesya... What does this say? It's a map of Lviv. That word means Egregor. February first, Egregor. There were words written inside the envelope that your father sent me with the ticket. I was jealous of her. She and my father had worked together. And then suddenly, I wasn't his daughter anymore. Now they're both dead. Have you ever felt.. like you didn't belong in your own life? Sometimes feels like I've been living someone else's. I can't remember the last time I went to a library. I promise, you've never been to one like this. I found it. It's part of a holy 14th century Christian manuscript. It was owned by a collector named Bobrovsky. In 1974, it was transferred to the Museum of Atheism here in Lviv. Okay... -So where is that? -You won't believe it, but it's in a cathedral. It's forbidden to touch the exhibits, especially when they date to 1397. The Kiev Psalter, brought here in 1974. Ask your questions. I'm sure you have many. If the Cynocephaly were protectors of Christ, why aren't there more depictions of them? There were some, but over the centuries, their contributions and images were erased. Why? The Cynocephaly betrayed the Son and were cursed by the Father. They crucified Christ, sacrificing him for the sins of mankind. But they remained faithful. They believed that a great sacrifice was required to watch towards eternity. We watch towards eternity. How did you know to speak to me in English? We weren't talking when we entered. That ring... Who are you? I'm not one of you, Father. I won't think twice about ending your life right now, if I have to. If you know something, talk. You're not who you think you are, Arthur. Save your strength for what's more important. Lesya is in danger. You have his heart. You'll manage. I didn't know him at all. My Father... he's... He was just a professor. Look, these numbers only appear in the imagery found in your father's apartment. They aren't in the original. They're co-ordinates. - Where is that? - Poland. Somewhere near Warsaw. Maybe it's a clue from my father. Let's find out. Cheers. To what? One another. And if that's not enough, then you're in the wrong company. We weren't such a bad couple, you know. I'm sorry. About everything that happened, what I did. You didn't do anything I shouldn't have expected. I ended up feeling just as lonely with you in New York as I did at home. That's why I left. I should have been there for you. I messed up. You're like my father in so many ways. Maybe, I couldn't go through it again. Your Father... He... gave me this a long time ago. Said it would help. Maybe it did. Anyway. I hope it does. Are you hitting on me? Damn. Busted. It's about an hour's walk. - You good? - Yeah, fine. I'm just... your tattoo... what does it mean? You want the truth? When you left, I was lost. Didn't know who I was anymore. What I'd become. Felt like I was just... drifting. 3:40 a.m. That's all I know about my life before I was adopted. That's when I was born. It's silly, but... reminds me who I am. Come on, long ways to go yet. This way. There's a river further down. We'll take a boat from there. This leads to a tunnel that should take us to the estate. Where we would find my father... Or something else. We are finally free of Oryst's weakness. And now, the gift from Oryst himself. His dog's heart. We have tamed and manifested numerous Egregors over the years, as we watch towards eternity. However, even harmony cannot exist without chaos. The world requires a new order. The white masks have led us to a loss of God. For God does not dwell where excessive freedoms reign. We need to leave now. Wait, what if my father's here? If he is, maybe we don't want to find him. My father is not one of them. Tomorrow, the Vatican secretary will be sacrificed for the redemption of our source and the Great Council will be held in Lviv. At long last, we will gain what we have longed for. We're in way over our heads. Even if your Father is alive and somehow here, how could we possibly... We need to be smart about this. Follow me. Come on. For our future victory, my friends. Arthur! Let her go. Or what? Please, take me instead, We'll take you both. Hmm... I left my party for you, Lesya. Who are you? Oh, I'm just a humble warrior of the Lord. And you... You followed my trails of breadcrumbs so diligently. I even painted an icon for you. You and your detective friend found it at your father's apartment. What happened to my father? It's time -you abandoned your false hopes -and accept the truth. What truth? That we took his feeble body and hang him by his neck. Hope you've got a one way ticket, Asshole. It's touching, your love and devotion to your father. Like you, I'm devoted to my cause. Two millennia ago, the faithful soldiers of Christ led their beloved teacher to crucifixion, At that time, there were but a handful of true believers. And yet, now there is 1.5 billion Christians in the world. Could this ever have occurred if not for the miracle of resurrection? Were it not for the biggest Egregor in the history of mankind. It surprised me that your father never shared his calls with you. Oh, I am sorry that he loved you less than you love him. Entrusting your life to a washed up detective who abandoned you here, alone. Only in suffering and sorrow can you find God. So maybe you're lucky, after all. It's time to rest. Oryst... February 1st, Egregor. Son of a bitch. I knew you would manage. Give me one good reason why not to. Because you'll need the bullets for someone far more dangerous than an old priest. Are you ready to learn the truth? Hello Arthur, I am glad you found my message. Perhaps you already know about the order. Through control of Egregors, it has swayed the course of wars, revolutions, and history. After World War II, my Father restored power into the hands of the white Cynocephaly and became Master of the order. And 40 years ago, that title passed on to me. But now, Albert Pototsky wishes to seize power. He plans to kill the secretary of the Holy See in hopes of starting a great, religious war that will drown this era in suffering. If I am no longer living, then perhaps, only my descendant can prevent this. I have the honor to present the daughter of Oryst Grabowski, Lesya, the only heiress of Professor's authority. Say it. Say it. She has spoken the words... She removes her bloodline from its right to power, officially resigning her rule. You have done a great service for the order. Go to hell. The Lord acknowledged my right when he brought me here. By his will, the black masks replace the white. Let us accept this blessing and know that I, the new master of the Cynocephaly's order, will fulfill God's will by shaping a powerful and unstoppable Egregor that will bring about a dawn of the new era. An era of destruction and death. This ends now. I am Oryst Grabowski's son. The only child he ever had. So you can let Lesya go. Wait... Lies! What proof do you have, but your own envy? You think anyone... Anyone believes your nonsense? Oryst was protecting me. He gave me to a foster home when I was born, then secretly adopted Lesya. He's lying, lying! You are your father's daughter and he... he's nothing. But jealous of us, longing for what he'll never have. Yes, you're right. I am my father's daughter. Prove your words, or die. Years ago, Oryst gave me these documents for safekeeping. And I promised to make them public after his death. I trust they will be proof enough. 35 years ago, I adopted Lesya to protect my true heir, to protect you, Arthur. Lesya's fate and perhaps that of all of us, is in your hands, Son. I know you won't fail us. What was it all for? What kind of power do these Egregors really have? In truth, not much at all. Egregors are merely spirits, but no will. It's the people who decide what fills their void, good or bad. Oryst dedicated his life to understanding. What if I can't handle it, your order. Then you'll be in good company. This belongs to you. It's your baby tag from when you were born.
