Cursed children. Shh! Best not silence mine tongue. Do you wish for the forest entire to know where we be? I wish to not be out within fogged wood. I wish to find mine son. This I know. You know not what I speak, man with gentle wife, two sweet children. Bereck be a fine boy... Ha! Whore's son. Naught but a shit stain. Be it here, I would tread upon his corpse... Perhaps then I can find some rest. Bereck and the others be out here still, and this I swear. Enough! I have no need of thy false hope... I need not treat with a child such as thee. Your balls have not yet dropped. Out! Out! Out, out, out! Hurry, boy! Naught but an old crone. What has become of our manhood? Shap, stop! My boy... My boy... what has become of ye? I-I'm sorry, Shap. Shap, we need to leave. Shap, we need to go. I have forsaken thee... - Shapur, we must go... - I have abandoned thee! Shapur. What would ye do... Shapur! What would ye do? What would ye do?! Take hold, Shap. Shapur! Take hold! We must leave him, Shap! I'll not abandon him again! We must flee! We must flee! Help... Help! Ewan! To my hut, quickly... Alis, take the children and hide. Go, go! Take the children, go! Loawen... Loawen, no, I need you. I-I must... Loawen, I need... Please, child, go, the gate. Go! It is nigh... It is nigh. Vouga? Vouga! What didst ye do? Cool his head! Cool his head... Hey, hey! Hey... She has spent all of the night treating thine husband's wounds. Do not act so quickly against someone who holdst you in their heart! Mind ye well, both of you. Thine husbands returned last night, whilst others did not in recent past. Is it ready yet? Come on, boy! Make haste! Come on, boy, keep up! Hurry, child! Enough, Vouga! There, there! He won't keep it in his mouth. Bind it, else he chew his tongue... You die, I'm going to tear open her legs. Hey! Ye shall be next! Go. Pinch it, pinch it tighter! This be your longest day yet! Oopsie. Yes, Ewan? He's not well, Vouga. No, he is not. Well... what if his wounds do not take to the branding? Then he shall die. He needs herbs and poultice, not the mere searing of flesh. I have done all I canst do for him. Ye best be concerned with thine own wounds... Lies! Speak what thou would speak. Go on, speak it plainly! Nay? No words? None, as I thought. The fault... it lies with ye. You foolish boy. Could ye take to that on a stone? I shall do so here. He was not himself after Matrea's taking. One cannot, nor should not blame a man for doing such a thing. Let me. Hold hither. Here, take it. Takest! Know ye what becomes an animal when it takes smelling to blood? A writhing takes to its nature, bending and churning deep within, cock-eyed by its hunger, with taking the weakness of the doe. It be beasts that pine for no such thing... That be of worry! Eyes... glassy and clear, they wait. Eyes upon the babe... Mothers and fathers becoming greed and stained hunger. Consuming all to tender heart. Well, what then? What monsters prey upon such men? Huh. Old judgement of ancient rite? Broken promises. And darkened dreams. Such men, they be deserving of punishment. Nature... she always takes. He didst not deserve. We all... We all deserve... We all... Vouga... Vouga! Vouga! Mother! I want to come out! Mother! Mother! Mommy! Mother! Mother! I want to come out... I am taking to it! Mother! Mother! Mommy! Mother! I need to, I need to! Good morrow! Good morrow! Does ye wish to go outside with Aela? Food? Water? Canst ye look at me when I speak? Uriel. Father? Father... Father! Aye? Didst Jikiraggy do that? Aye. What of Darnen? Well, Darnen... Darnen be... Darnen be gone. Darnen could still be within the woods, Father. Nay. Darnen be gone. Father, ye mustn't give up your hope... Enough, daughter. Ye mustn't... I said enough. Father... Stop it! Shh, shh... Ye must promise to not go into the woods. Ye must swear it. Aye. I swear, I shall not go into woods, Father. Thank ye. You're a good girl. A very good girl. A fine girl. You're a good girl, Uriel. Little rabbit... Little rabbit? Where hath thy been, little rabbit?

But those... those who transgressed, they returned to the soil, this ye know. 15, I count, returned beneath. The creature, its roars in the dark... I count... ten little ones. Torn from breast and laughter. We struck an oath. Why hast ye abandoned your words? Came. Forest give. Take. Forest give more. Take more. Take more. Forest... give... ...all. Take... more. No, 'tis not true. By mine own sweat and blood, we take not more than we need. It be mine own eyes that watch upon every feather that falls. Eyes blind. Open your heart.

Forest comes. She... take... back. She hungry... She feeds... What... What else do we have to give? Vouga! Hurry! Hurry, Vouga! Hurry! Wait, wait! Heaven's aid. Apace, child! The fire! Apace, apace!

Away. I shall not argue with thee. Do not worry, child, I will lay upon him my healing hands. Just a few moments longer. Thou ne'er didst hark.

Guide us unto thy bosom, O Mother, give us... give us pardon, and... and grant us grace, and bestow thy mercy. Forebear thy judgment and thy grim chastisement. Ye who lives long, shelters our most grateful flesh, deliver us not down into th-thine arms until our days numbered, and grant to us thy nurture... Stay thy judgment... Stay we as thine undeserving children, who hath fouled... ...Who have fouled our clouded eyes... Ye who didst suffer our birth... Ye who didst suffer our birth, bestowing unto us thy bosom for us to suckle amidst our greed and our vices, to heal our weeping wounds by thy soil, show thy mercy graciously. Forbear thy judgment and thy grim chastisement, we beseech thee! Stop it. We beseech thee... Send to us again your loving embrace. Thou art most gracious. Restore into thine arms thou most loving... Stop it. Stop it... And grant us thy mercy. - Grant us thy most gracious... - Stop it, stop it... Stop it! What hath possessed ye? Restore thy gracious... Loawen. Loawen, takest thy head. T' head! Gently, gently... Bawbling steps. Down. No! So be it! Ewan... Loawen! Loawen! Ewan! Cleanse thyself, take care of the children! Father? Vouga? What hath become of mine daughter? Ye can speak unto mine ears, child. Why did she go? Jikiraggy will come to take all of your bones. One... One by one, until ye too shall grow to become a beautiful weed. Dost ye wish to speak unto him? What should I say? A memory... of a time most favorite? An affection ye miss the most. A place of love ye could both run off to... I have no such memories. Had I been at his side... Ye should be ashamed. Ye should be ashamed! Ye is to blame! I beggest thy pardon? Ye shall receive no pardon of mine! Why should I seek your forgiveness? What foul deed hath I done? Mer, Vouga hath done no more than... She hath brought death upon us all! Ye is to blame! Ye is to blame for my child! My husband! All. And ye is the only one who has lost? I saw ye... travel into thy wood with a man I had never 'ey laid mine eyes upon. Hmm? A man of moss and of soil... Doth this be true? Nay, u-under duress, ye may kn... Lies! The man in the wood... you speak with him? How hath she lived all these years, hmm? A witch of the wood? I speak truth, do I not? How couldst ye? She couldst because she seduced the beast to do her own bidding! The same seduction done onto mine own husband... Thou husband hath been the beast! Thou spawn takes to this wood like... like plague on flesh! Does thy know how many children and women he laid with his flesh? Lies! I lie not! Does thou lie thy flesh upon me? Loawen? Has thou touched my flesh? No? Not either? He... deserved to be in his stifled ground. They didst not! I am no witch. My time come when ages are up. Mer, ye know, ye know the beast that thy husband was! The rot... from thine mother and my mother. Judgement below. Rot. Mine daughter. Father, he... he took Aela. Father will make everything all right. Come here. Make everything all right. Father... Father! Ewan, stay! Mommy! Father! Good health? Good? - Yeah. - Good. We must keep on. I wanst not think on the violence shouldst we be found. No. May we hie around? That couldst take days, daughter. Mayhaps we tr... Oh... Shh! Shh! We canst not. Ah! Shh... Shh. Hush, child. Shh. Softly. But soft, mine child. Is it the hour? Mm-mm. Thou knowest? Yes. I'll not argue with thou, then. Does thou desire to stay hold for an instant to catch thy breath? Art thou becoming restful, c'rky man? Enough out of thou. Rest for an instant. He quoth to course the yellow and blacken-eyed flowers beyond the treeline. I see not one of the sort. Father. Aye? Forgive mine own foolish nature. What doth thou say? For all my foolishness encompassed... ...this journey, the loss of the hearth, the banishment. Betraying thy trust. My life entire. I am a blinking clotpole, and never deserve thy love. Hush now, child. I shall hark no more of it. Bitter regrets and woe. Why hast this foul circumstance overtaken us? I would I knew. Forsooth, I do not. Yet it is not our place to put the Lord's resolve to question. We submit in... What, Father? Ah! A lamp unto thy feet! A lamp unto thy feet... a light unto thy path. Thou preserve those who trust in thy good faith, O Lord. Thy great love unfaltering, thy whole hand unfailing. May thou keep our journey true to thy grace. To whom doth ye pray? To whom? Our lord and savior... Christ. Hmm. What be the moon count of your bearing? How long hast thy been with child? Uh, since first Yule. What be a Yule? Uh... where joinest thou from? A village, not far reaching here. Might thou take us there? I beggeth thee! We hath been upon the wood for many a day, and mine own daughter, she be nearing her birth, and we've nae lodging to... Follow, then, unto the village. Peace and joy upon thou. Though we... Forgive mine deed. Ah! The Lord hath answered unto our prayers. Come on, now. The dusk be coming. - Lead on. Gently, we... we shall follow. The flowers are beautiful, Father. In truth, Godiva. Weeds, in truth. How couldst thou say such a thing? They be blooming, choking and shading out all else. Hmm. They are still of great beauty. Wouldst ye like a flower? We shouldst not disturb their vibrance. Many thanks unto thee. Weeds have no place in the wood. Many thanks. Many beautiful things accost mine eyes this day. Why be ye taken to wood at such a time? Where be ye joining from? Adenburry, a fortnight since. And ye departed your home? 'Twere time to move on, 'tis all. Nigh the eve of your ribs' birth? She's mine daughter. How couldst I forget? There'll be shelter in the village. Need not to worry your minds. 'Tis a great kindness. We are in thy debt, then. Ye owe us naught. Thy wood is truly a gift. Oh! The instant be nigh! Apace, now! Breathe, daughter, breathe. Apace! Apace! The lady is with child. Many moons! I need you to find the old axe while I soothe her insides. Go. What doth thou regard? Ye canst be hither for this. I shall not leave my daughter's side. Then she shall die. What didst thou say? Kind sir... to bring forth this child safely, I shall need all the room I can, and this not be a cavernous chamber. However... strong hands to coax forth the swollen afterbirth would be of good use. Ah. In truth, be that as it may, perhaps I shall leave it to thine strong hands. She be strong, this I warrant. Aye, she is. Where... ...where art the others living hither? Those not hither at this instant have taken to the ground. Mm. To the ground? Gathering, child. Your touch is of a calming one. I thank thee. Thy father spoke of Adenburry. My mother used to speak unto us stories of a place beyond. In memory I remember she said this place. Thou hast never left here? Nay. Drink. Mm. Ho... what is in that? Oh. Mugworts. Ginseng. For what... for what reason hast thou never departed? Mine father would never allow it. Well, surely thy father must be taken to his end? Nay. Aye! Is just myself. I am far frometh myself of late. Take to mine hand. My name is Caenen. Loawen. Ah. Uriel? Come. Meet our new friend. May you watch her while I gather some herbs? Of course. Mm. Thank thee. Whoa! Whence hath thou joined from? Oh, fine. A silent young woman. Bear thy tongue shut if thou so wishes. To what is thy most cherished flower? Thou doth not love flowers? Oh. We tooketh upon countless yellow and blacken-eyed flowers in the woods. 'Twas... There, now. I-I beseech thy forgiveness. I beg thy forgiveness. W-we shall talk no more of flowers. All's well, Uriel? Aye, all's well... I spoke unto her! Uriel? Good. To what dost those belong? A mere trap. Naught moe. Where art thy people? Gone. To what place hast they? Within the forest. 'Tis nearly dusk. When shalt they be returning? When shalt they be return... What didst I hark? What? But... What... what... No! Father! Help! Help, please. Please, I am with child! Please! Help. Help me, please.

Anon. We shall take to gathering our things. Mer, gather what ye needeth, not a thread more. Hey, we might not. But prepare ye to leave. Gather your things. Hurry along. Father? Uriel? That be ye? Forgive my deeds, daughter. Forgive my reckless deeds. It's all right, Father. Truly? Mm-hmm. Oh, thank thee, daughter. Thank thee. Might... thou... allow me out? 'Twasn't not more than mine fevered wounds. My mind was not what it was. They be healin'. I am better now. I miss thy embrace. I shall fetch Mother to let ye... Wait! Wait. Wait. Wait. Might we compose it a surprise? Then we might compose a smile on Mother's face. Doff the rope... ...and I shall protect thee... ...until the end of thy days. Loawen! Uriel! No! No! No! No!
