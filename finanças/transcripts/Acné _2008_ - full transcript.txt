Excuse me, what does it say here? Meet Judith Bannaimon, who's in charge of youth projects in the community. Please pay attention to her interesting plan. - Have you heard of the Atid Plan? - Yes. No. Every year we have programs to know Israel. There are study, work plans... For 13-14 year-olds like you we have a one-month tourist plan, where you'll see Israel's most important sites. I'll leave a list on the hallway leading to the restrooms, and will be back in a few weeks so you may sign up. Here's a few copies with the sites you'd visit. - I'll take care. - Thanks. Talk it over at home. Pass them over. Try not to eat fried junk, turated fats, chocolate... Don't get any sun, it's bad for you. - And when I play tennis? - Wear hat and sunscreen.

Bregman, give him a purple chip. Hi. How are you, Rafa? +li. - Mom, can I have 200 pesos? - In my purse. - Good, ciao. - Ciao. - What will you do, Rafa? - Nothing. - Bye then. - Ciao. Way to go, dude. - Was it good? - It rocked. He did good, your pal. - I got 120. - No, all holes is 200. +li Bialistocky. How was it? Great. - Cool. - Let's go. L may 90 in again. Rafa, stop wasting money. Let's go. C'mon, I bet you do it with everyone. What's your name? Uh Alberto. Alberto, there's no French kissing, you understand? OK. - Got a girifriend? - No. Well, get one and French-kiss her. OK. Shall we go on? Pass. I pass too. Amy. You pass every hand? I'm getting bad cards. You have to tease lady luck... Look at Bialistocky, he debuts and wins. I'm all set. Give me 2. - What? - Give me 2. I bet 70. - Rafa, get Angelica. - Drop it, Rony. Dad... - Dad. - What? - Give me 200 pesos. - There, in my pants.

You'll French-kiss soon, you'll see. Rafa, what's that plan about? Just a month, but you only miss 2 weeks of class. - Go, your brother went. He liked it. - Yup. But I am me, I don't want to go to Israel. I rather stay here. To do what, dumb ass? Play cards with your friends all day? I don't want to decide now. There's nothing to decide. Just go. Israel-party all day. Your friend Andy's going. He hasn't signed up yet. And I don't want to go. Good boobs there... Leave him alone, Martin. He'll decide, right? You got your piano, the treatment, tennis. Mom, this guy's such a moron. Throughout history our people lived great tragedies. We were enslaved by Egypt, we suffered the destruction of the two temples, were victims of expulsion in Spain and exile in Babylon. Each of these facts... h a commemoration date. But Yom Hash is the most important date for today's Jewish people. It reminds the worst of these tragedies. Now, in silence, we'll go see a documentary about the Holocaust. - You ask her. - No, you ask her. - No, you do. - OK. - You're Karin, right? - Yes. - Can I get a lap? - No. Some Popsicle then? Are you doing anything afterwards? Shut up. We're trying to watch this. You staying until the end? This movie is a bore. - You know how it ends, right? - No, we don't. 6 million die. You know what, Pablo? You're a son of a bitch. What happened? Nothing, four-graders are stupid. Shut up, dick. Rafa, tell her you lover her, kinda tender. - Get it? - Sure. But don't get nervous, chicks notice it. What if the chick gets nervous? I don't know. I'm only giving you a few tips. Maybe Nicole's never kissed anyone either and you figure something out. Each chick is different. Say, last year with Margolis, I held her hand and got to first base real quick. - Don't mention it to Laura. - Why? Just don't, Rafa. Look, your friend. - Ciao Bregman. - Ciao Laser. I've been with Laura 3 years, this fling with Margolis was last year. Get it? - You don't say a word either. - Sure. Tell your mother I'm taking money for tomorrow's errands. I'll tell her. Again, from the top. F sharp. Here, listen. Will you practice? All your classmates are ahead of you, you know? Yes. But you don't care. - You know who I'd do? - Who? - Rony's mom. - Rorly's mom? - Wouldn't you? - You bet. Ijerked off 3 times thinking about her. - Is she hot? - She's a babe. Ate her PUSSY? - Went to town on it. - Motherfucker. - Ciao. - Ciao. Come in. C'mon bitch, get into it. Juan, can you tell him something? Move, Rafa. - What is that? - Nothing, it's the treatment. Disgusting. First we'd do Tel Aviv, then Haifa, then Eilat and last Jemlem. What's that face about? It's a month. You'll stay with Rony. It's not the me. Why would you want to know Israel? Dunno, my father wants me to go. It's an experience after all. Think about it, Andy. Hey kids. +li Carios. - Andy, watch the shop, I'll go home. - OK. - Ciao, Rafa. - Ciao. - Come with me? - Sure. - Go to your room. - OK. Come with me, then I'll drop you at the cosmetologist. OK. - Ciao, mom. - Ciao, honey. - Did I give you money? - Yes. Will be back in 2 hours. Are you still using Dinacin locally? Yes. And Erythromycin gel. Yeah... You have to keep using that. - Thanks. - Enjoy. +lello. Rafa, how's it going? Good, you? Should we go dance tonight? - No, I've told Rony. - Why? - I'm tired. - What is it? Nothing. You sure? - I'd tell you otherwise. - I think Nicole's going. I don't care who goes, I'm not going, period. - You may lose her. - L don't give a shit. Cool then. - We'll talk tomorrow. - Yeah, ciao. - Rafa, want to play cards? - Not today Naty. - Please. - No, giri. Close the door, hold all my calls. In school when the boy was about to kiss the gir1, the priest would put his biretta in front of the projector. When he removed it the kiss was already gone. We'd make such a fuss... - Change this, it's really old. - I like it. Eventually they allowed to show king in films, as long as they weren't too extreme. We'd count them if they were goals. 1-0... a 1-1 tie... 2-1... And so on. Silly, huh? Now they've gone too far... in the movies, magazines, everywhere. It's all sex all the time. Rafa, would you kiss me? What are you talking about? Kissing is for couples, not siblings. - Why don't mom and dad kiss? - I don't know. You start with a kiss, then move on to the next base and so on... - ls 750 OK? - Yes ma'am. I'm not deducting the missing money. Will you press charges? No, I won't. But don't ask me for a reference, you understand? Yes ma'am. We'll locate this kingdom in France in the 17th century. It's a different France from the one you see in maps today, even geographically. Did you study for geography, Pablo? No, dude, if th doesn't work we're fucked. I got the UN and WWII. - Here's Cold War. - Soviet Union, put it there. Soviet Union's here, Cold War here, WWII there, the UN too. If we don't get these topics we're fucked. Bregman. Come, don't go. - Taking a dump? - Not me. Who's the little blond in your class? Which one? Petite, jumper dress. You know which one. Nicole. Nicole what? Weiss. Damn, she's hot. You'll ask her out, Javi? Does she fuck? I don't know. She's seeing someone I think. You told them something? Told them to keep off our chicks and go fuck themselves. Royal envido. Accept. I. - 37. - You beat me. - Lemme know if you want any changes. - OK. Here's the copy and the original. There's a balance to be paid, should I call your dad or your mom? W mm. Naty, I won't let you beat me at the cards. You're a sened player now. Martin-If I can't beat you at tennis this year, I'll retire. My siblings, Naty and Martin, come light this candle. The last candle is the most special one. Without them, I wouldn't be here, reading. Without them, I wouldn't be who I am. Without them, I wouldn't be. Thank you mom and dad. I hope you enjoy this moment that's so important to me. Did you go to a shrink? Long ago. 16. 14... A puff. Iwenttoowhenlwasaboy. - You never told me. - It was long ago. Goal. 16-15. Did you wet your bed? You bet. Did you? Yes. Put the goal. Goal! Hold on a sec. C' mon, dad. Omen. OK, 10%, don't ask me for more. So it's 15.000, plus all the fridges and blenders. 'The 9&7 'Dad! ' You'll find a prospect, it's a big thing. Yes, some are tax-free, as usual. I'll send everything on Tuesday. B59 We, dear. - What a bore. - Gregorio, can you come up? - Ready? - Been ready for ages. Last call and we'll go. Rafa. 45:. - Got lottery? - No. OK, ciao. Mom says the car's in the garage and I should go with you. OK. - What time tomorrow? - 20 to. - Ciao. - Ciao. - Hi, Rafa. - Hi. My parents are divorced too. - Really? - Yes. I only sent there misers, indecent and malicious people... causing the people of Israel to suffer. Rashi and Onoolus, two important... Torah scholars, say that 'm Sodom and Gomorrah... there were only misers, evil people and... Make a move on Nicole, or you'll never k anyone. I know. - I mean it. - Yeah, I'll do it. - OK, ciao. - Ciao. Good trip. My brother says Israelis got boobs. Hope so. - Ciao. - Ciao. You get the orange painting, I get the picture frames. We're going to Punta del Este this summer, right? Sure, Mom id it would all be the me. All my friends are going. - Will dad go? - L don't know. Mechanic. Bricklayer. Bricklayer is a decent prof ion. No, I don't have a father. Don't have a father. I don't have a mother. Bregman, are you pulling my leg? I know your parents. Their busin is near my house. Hey, teacher, don't make fun. You must think about it. I hope you don't do this again. So now I'll k you, to apologize to your teacher, and then go home and apologize to your parents. So... please, Rafa. Teacher, I apologize. I meant no disrespect. 0K, Bregman, I “wept your apology. May this be the last time I have to come for something like this. You embarrass me in front of everyone. - Did you hear the principal? - Yes, mom. - Make this the last time. - Yes. THEY'RE NOT FRECKLES, THEY' RE PIMPLES. GOOD, FRECKLES ARE FOREVER. Or can you analyze a worid of human beings, the geography of a country. France, in this case. - What? - Nothing. - Won't take notes? - No, you? Me neither. Tic-tac-toe? Sure and that character. What do you think? You... Rafa, how's it going? Good, you? Good. What's up? You want something? What's wrong with you? C'mon, what's the big deal? My tum. - Show me. - You first. Hush, right? Yes. - But I got a full house. - You're damn lucky. - Talent. - Another one? - No, we're going. - C'mon, one more. No, let's go. - Shall we? - Sure. Hi, And the cake for my friends? It's just out of the oven. Your mom called, she'll come later. Any allergies or medication you've taken for a long time? - No, right? - No. Any psychiatric treatment? No, never. We'll try Percutane then. Expensive, aggressive pills, but very effective. It's a powerful inhibitor of the sebaceous gland. Don't mind the counter-indications. Why? They're scary, but Rafa is a healthy kid. And he won't take it for long. The only side effect could be chapped lips. What should I do about the chapped lips? - I'll have to tum it in like this. - OK. Umnkaia, go for 'n. Kiss! Kiss! One, two... three! Do it again. Open this for me Bialistocky. Get married now, honey. Yo, Rony. Did Laura say why Nicole didn't show? No, no idea. Are you dumb? You think she'd k you in front of everyone? With everybody yelling and stuff. No way. You have to ask her out, get in a romantic mood. It should be a dark place. Dark is good, write it down. When do we have a dark party? End-of-r party, youth camp maybe. - Not sure I'm going to youth camp. - Are you dumb? Youth camp is ideal, the woods. You can make your move there. You got 15 seconds. Ready? On your marks. 15 seconds. 34. Help each other. 4 seconds left. C'monjanijim. We'll do it again. Now in 10 seconds. Get down now, you hear? I bet it all. Ipass. Sevens. Straight. Motherfucker. - Rafa, where're you going? - Restroom. - All good, Bregman? - Laser. - What were you doing? - Nothing, bored. - Wanna smoke? - Sure. Camp sucks this yr, doesn't it? I go. I never did like camps. They bore me. Got any cream to spare? I forgot mine. Sure. They prescribed me Percutane. My dad won't buy it. Too expensive, he says. - You look much better, Bregman. - Thanks. - Wanna hear? - OK. - What is it? - Nothing. - Does your father come here often? - I don't know. - When did he change cars? - No, that was my mother's. - Can't wait, I'm going in. - Wait.

Yes, we danced the waltz at my Bar Mitzvah. But that doesn't count. Shall we go for a walk alone? - But we're dancing now. - Yes, you're right. I don't like this music. Shall we go for a walk alone? OK. - It's nice here. - Yes. What's your kind of music? All kinds. Like, which bands? I don't know... Rollings, Fabulosos, Stones, Ratones... Aren't those real heavy? Yes, but I like them. Give me a sec. I'm going to the toilette. - Laser. - All good, Bregman? M! am? Good. You still on Percutane? Yes, but you can't take it for long. Would you give me your left over?
