Ah, kisses! Sweet, tender, passionate... Everything you need to know about the other person is in that first kiss. In that one moment... Okay, come on, calm down. When you kiss someone, you can feel whether that person is for you or not. Whether or not you're made for one another. - It's as though you can tell... - My love. Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. Mm! It's just... So, you know when your boss gets crazy, and asks for a million things all of a sudden? Like, hello? It's Friday night at the end of the day. Why didn't you ask yesterday? You're so serious. - Oh? - Yes. Is something wrong? What could be wrong? - You still haven't had any of the nuts? - Huh? The nuts are still here. You usually eat them up like there is no tomorrow. Mm. Hm. Hello. - What's up, Silvia? - How are you? - Hello. - Hi. - Berta, Silvia. - It's a pleasure. Hm. It's just... he's so nice, isn't he? You know, at the start, he's so sweet... But then, he looks at you, like, in a weird way. Like in a way that he... he knows something you don't. Then all of a sudden, out of the blue, he dumps you. - What is this, Silvia? - It's true, though. It's true. You dumped me, out of nowhere. - I'm sorry, but we're still together. - It was right here as well. Uh... Are we breaking up? No. - Has he had any nuts? Oh. - What? Look, he arranged to meet you on a Friday. When the bar is packed, so you can't make a scene. And I also bet he's already paid, so he can leave in a hurry. - You're sounding foolish. - There you go. But we're doing so well. - Yes. Yes, just as things are going well. - Yeah. It's just that... he doesn't see a future. Mmm. Well, he says that to everyone. He's just afraid of commitment, you know? I guess I am. - How can you know we don't have a future? - Well, because... I still remember my first kiss. Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! That was the exact moment it all started. Back then, I didn't understand. But it wasn't long before I did. - Hey... - If I win, you buy dinner. Ugh, that was a bust. Everything happened exactly like that. And when I say everything, I mean... everything. I lost three years of my life. The three years I dated her. But I just needed one last date to confirm my worst fears. So is writing what you really want to do? I'd really love to, but I don't have the discipline for that. I want to be a great publisher, you know? Publish new talent, not any bestsellers. When you see the logo, you'll say, "This one has quality." - Well, I like to go free-diving. - Oh, look at that. Hey! Someone help us! - He's swallowed a lot of water. - Someone please help us! This weekend I'm going with some friends to the beach. You want in? - Don't think so. - Then next weekend? Um... I'm gonna grab coffee. Bye, then. I know what's going to happen from the first kiss. The good times. - And the bad. - But... But how can you know we don't have a future? It's what's best for us. Believe me, I know. It means I can enjoy myself and jump ship before things turn sour. You're a bastard. Because things always turn sour. You weren't expecting that. LOVE AT FIRST KISS If I had your talent, I'd put on a show on Main Street. - With a 15% discount for your exes. - Yeah, sure. Lower your voice, come on. Hey, why don't you use it to find your next bestseller? Oh, I wish. You know that's not how it works. You know what isn't working? I knew it. We're bankrupt, is that it? No. I heard your friend say this isn't working. My friend's a podiatrist. He knows calluses, I know books. A truck just came in. They're returning 500 copies of Diary of a Chicken Farmer. - Uh, so, what should we do? - Well, who would've thought? - The memoirs of a chicken farmer. - It's a story of an empty Spain. Know how many books about "Empty Spain" there are? - Enough to fill it all up again. - Listen, I don't want cynics in this room. If you don't believe in this project, you can leave. - Come on, Simón, I'll help you out. - Sure. - Come upstairs. How about dinner tonight? - All right. - I'll tell Lucía, okay? - Ah! I gotta get up early tomorrow. - Come on, let's go out anyway, man. - No. - We haven't gone out in ages, it's been... - I mean it, no. Good news. Lucía is bringing one of her friends to dinner. - Yeah, but the thing is I... - No "yeah, but." Bye. See ya. Come on. - See you later. Bye, guys. - Bye. Where do we put this? I heard that the first run was a total flop. - How are you? - What are you working on? Vampires in Mauthausen. - Sequel, huh? - A prequel. - Mm. - Oh, that's great. - Mm. - Hey there, how are you? - Look who's here. - Wow, you're here? Did you come for the sushi? No. I don't eat sushi at something like this. I got food poisoning at the Nadal Awards. How are things going, man? I heard you were having problems. - Wouldn't make it to the end of the year. - You're mistaken. I'm talking to some investors that are pretty major. - Mm. - Anyone we might know of? I can't give any names 'cause... I don't speak Chechen. We're expecting a massive cash investment. Thinking of moving offices and everything. - Oh, to somewhere with heating? - Hm... - You won't be laughing come September. - Oh, really? What happens in September? I'm releasing the new book by Sonsoles Durán. Mm. A return to her early literature. - Feminine, very stark. - Mm. - With that ironic take on life, you know? - Oh. - Yeah, there she goes. - She's going for it. - At her house, writing away. - Yeah. No, no, no. She meant she's there. - Look. Right there. - Hm? - Lamb dumplings for you? - No. Thank you. - May I have a glass of wine instead? - Yes. No. I'd actually like a... I'd like a beer. No, hold on. Come here, come here. Better still... a vodka. - Vodka. - A vodka. - Mm. - Thank you. - Sonsoles... - Javier. Hey. - Javier, how are you? How are you doing? - Uh, I'm good. - But shouldn't you be writing? - I feel awful. An hour ago, I was sitting at the house with anxiety so paralyzing that I simply couldn't write... And then I thought, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Snap out of it." I opened a drawer, then I took a diazepam, and said, "Be at that party." And here I am. - And I don't care if I don't get an award! - All right. Because do you know what award life has given me? Dignity. Oh, look, I fucked that bald guy once. Oh. Uh, how's the book coming along? - Good. - What does that mean? Well, just good... - You'll have something to read soon. - When? - I make books, not sausages. - Forgive me. It's just that we have a schedule, and we've spent quite some time... Javier. I could've signed with Anagram. And I didn't. Do you know why? Because Anagram doesn't want you. Thank you. No one wants you. Sonsoles was a huge hit with her first novels. Everyone hailed her as the voice of her generation. - She didn't handle it too well. - Hello, Sonsoles. You are so incredible. - I just can't believe I'm here. - This is my first book, though. Yeah. The Year of the Panther is my favorite. Right, but I have a new book out. The Year of the Tigress. Yes, but the thing with the first book is... Wow, you surpassed yourself. - It's the best thing you've ever written. - Surpassed myself? Surpassed myself, how? Too intelligent, too dumb, too pretty, ugly, huh? Um, it's for María José. Thank you. "To María José. Eat my pussy." Yes. Eat my pussy. Go on, get the hell out of here. - I used to admire you. - Yes? Well, go admire the Virgin Mary. So, if anyone else wants me to sign my first book, you can leave. Just go. Because I'm here to autograph my second book today. No respect. Thanks a lot. So little respect for the author. So little respect for culture. All right, go on. Sonsoles hasn't had a hit in ten years. I'm at a weird moment right now. It's not easy. Come on, let's go! Dammit, sing a little people! You guys look like you're being audited! What the hell? Let's go. Half of you deserve that. I'm her last hope. And she's mine. Unless I can get her to finish her book soon, I can kiss my dream goodbye. Hmm. I always struggle with chopsticks. It's all really tasty, isn't it? - Very... Yes. - Yes, it's really tasty. It's quite good. - How long have you been working together? - Um... A month. Well, three. Three months, right? It was since the... Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. Listen, um... Roberto told me how things are going with the publishing house. - We're good. - Well... You really should try a focus group. - Me? - Oh, no. Not you. - You would have terrible rating. - Thank you. Your books. We could set up a group, right? With various people. Who would read your books and say, "We connect with this, not that..." No, thank you. - No? Don't you need any help? - It's that I make books, not sausages. - Hmm. - Oh. I like that. It's just one more tool to help reach your consumer. - Literature is not for consuming. - Yeah, not yours. That is true. Right, well, okay. Good vibes? A bit of... Right? Right? - Are you from Madrid, Esther? - No, from Valencia. Oh. - I came to Madrid after a... - Hey, there. We have to order the cheesecake here, 'cause it's really good. Could you let the poor thing speak? After my boyfriend ended things. Mm. We were together maybe for seven years while he was working towards getting a job as a prison officer. They offered him a job in Picassent, and he left me in a month. Had to choose me or working in a jail, and he chose the jail. Hmm. If you get the cheesecake, I'll have some. Mm... No. No, uh, whatever you want. - Yeah. Okay, sweetheart? - Yeah. - Well... all right, then. - Well, then. It was lovely meeting you. Hey... should we go grab one last drink? I can't. I have ingrown toenails tomorrow. - Ingrown toenails? - Yes. You get those every day, no? Uh, no, I leave them for Fridays to end the week on a high. - You know that. - Roberto. When was the last time we went out? Come on. Uh, your sister's 40th birthday, for example? - This year she turned 43. - Yeah, seriously, though. I have to go. - I'm gonna get going as well. - No. You stay. Send me a message and say how it went. - What message? - Wait. Wait! - Yes, I'm going. Good night. Bye. Bye! - Don't you go! No! Hey, listen... Should we still have that nightcap, then? I... I know a place that's nearby, if you... - Yes. Yes. - Yes. So... You...? - Only one drink. That's all. - That way? Yes. Yes, yes. You two are a good match. Yeah, sure. - I'll finish my beer and I'll go. - No. - What do you mean, no? - I told her I'd get her a date. - You are her date. - I can't interrupt her. She's on Eurovision. Plus, you don't want me to hook up with your friend. - Why not? - You don't like me. You never have. Sure, but you're a transition fuck. That's all. Is that all? A selfish fucker afraid of commitment, so I'd say that's right, no? Here she goes. - Hey, what's wrong? Not dancing? - It's that I have to go now. - No. No! - Esther, honey, it's so late. - Let's just go already. - No, come on... Whoa! What are you doing? This is awesome! Now you kiss! Surprise! - Very good quality. - Two hundred? Thank you! Whoo! Okay, what... what do we do? We can't leave her like this. You take her. Oh, great, thank you. She's on the sixth floor, no elevator. Here, take her. Hold her. Ah. Hello! Over here! You all right? Uh... Where does she live? Uh, it's peppermint. Well, that's all there was. Thank you. So, how is she? I mean, she's fine. She's fine. She's comfy. Hmm. The hangover'll suck. I'm sorry for what I said to you earlier. While we were at the club. Um... No. It's okay. You were sincere. I'd rather that than the things you say when Roberto's around. - What about you? - What about me? You clench your jaw every time I try to speak. - I have TMJ. - Oh, yeah, sure. Not when you're with your friend, right? Because you laugh at all the bullshit he says. I live with the guy, and I could swear he's not that funny. I don't even remember. Since you started living together, I barely see him. And that's my fault, right? No, no, no, no. Don't get it twisted. Your friend doesn't go out with you, me, or anyone. He just wants to work, grab himself a beer, lie on the sofa, and watch The Mandalorian. You mind if I tell you a secret? Hm. I can't stand Baby Yoda any longer. I have to go. Here's the last one. - Javier? - Yes? Take a look at this. Santiago Doñate. - Why would I go to see this guy talk? - He's at odds with his editorial. He's at odds with the world. - He's popular, you know. - Well, our authors know how to write. Sure, but it doesn't sell. Why don't we try another? Look, those who chronicle wars are dicks who spend a week watching bombs fall from their hotel, and the rest of their life writing about it. - His books are exciting. - Don't tell me about exciting battles. Tell me about getting to work this morning and make it sound exciting. Well, I got the bus across the street for breakfast and... Simón. Stop. Hello. Do you need any help? - Hey. - Hello. Um... Uh, would you like coffee? Uh... No. No, thanks. Good. I don't have any pods. They cost too much. Hm. Um... I wanted to say thanks for helping with Esther. - Yeah. - Well, actually, no, it's not... It's not that. I mean, it is. But that was not what I... It's that this place is on my way to work. And... Mm... It always felt kind of awkward to walk in and say hi... That's not what I want to say either, that's not... Did something happen last night? Between us? I mean, don't worry at all. We had a drink, you know, but, because, like, for some reason, we were, I mean, adults, nothing actually happened. I just wanted to make sure that you weren't making a big deal out of this. No. No, no, not a big deal at all. No, not at all. - Did what I say bother you? - No. You're saying it's bad to hook up with my best friend's girlfriend. - Thanks for that. - What the hell are you saying? I'm... Look, I just want things to be okay with us. Everything's the same. You go your way, I go mine. - Well, I didn't want this either. - Then what do you want? - Well, for us to be... - We're on the wrong page. ...to be friends, huh? You are nice. Look, surprise. You know, I can be nice too. Just don't tell people. Oh, Santiago Doñate is so cool. - Seriously? - I've read all his work. - Oh? - I used to steal them from my brother. Yes, well, I know it's nothing super highbrow. But, I don't know... - They're pretty exciting. - I told you so. - Are you signing him? - No. You should. - Not sure, uh... - Dude. Then invest the money you make in some guy who thinks he's the new Foster Wallace. - I don't even know his books. - I do. I'm so glad you asked me that question. If I've seen the horror. Of course I've seen it. I've seen it in Kosovo in the year of '98. During Christmas. I've seen it in Sudan, 2013. Fifty degrees in the shade. The blood dries out. And the same things are repeated. The liberator becomes a scoundrel. And the friend becomes a Judas for plate of dried lentils. Oh, it's to save his family, you see. Ask yourselves. "Would I save my own family?" Be careful now, hm? You might save your own ass first. You don't know what it's like in a war. Where humans turn into animals. Yeah. Clap, go on. Go on. He's going now. Santiago. How are you doing? Javi. Javier. Castaños. We met years ago, one summer at El Escorial. - You were a speaker? - No. - I was a grill eating suckling pig. - I don't remember. I do. Pig in summer, bad decision. Listen, this is Lucía. - It's a pleasure. - Nice to meet you. She's a big admirer. - So just her? - No, of course, I am too. And that's why I want to talk. - I own a small publishing house. - No. Mm-mm. Not that small. Well, medium-sized. - And I know you're looking for a new one. - Not looking. If someone wants my books, they know where to find me. That's why we're here. - You want to publish me? - I do. Which is your favorite book? There are so many, right? Um... - Pale Fire by Nabokov. - No, no, one of my books. Ah... Um... - Oh, Sunrise Over Mosul. - Sunrise Over Mosul. That one. For sure. Although great, it's not as good as, um... - As Sunset Over Kabul. - Sunset Over Kabul. Or... Or Nightfall Over Liverpool. The thing is, we're not very big. The big ones. When they screw you, they screw you with everything they got. - That's true. - Hm. You remind me of a woman I met on the island of Hydra. Ah. "When things turn bad, all one can do take the woman you love and embrace her, and wait for the storm to subside." Hm. Go on then, kid. Embrace her. - No, we're not... No way. - No. No, no, no, no, no. We're not... - She and I aren't... - Do you think I could get a signature? There's no need to ask. Uh, it's Lucía. - What's your publishing company called? - Mon FORTE Editions. We're at Redondilla 17. When you're free we can grab a coffee... No way in hell. Everyone around knows how much you owe people. - Even my mother. - Huh? You heard what I said. - How humiliating. - Nah, it went great. Yeah, really well. For you, because you like to see me fall. - On my face. - Yeah. Yeah, it was awful. But we have to try, even if we fail. - Oh, yeah? Says who? - I do. Come on, imagine if things always turned out how we wanted. - How boring, no? - That sounds great, to be honest. And how would you learn? I don't know. I think we tend to overvalue suffering. Oh, there he is. - A hedonist, yeah? - Yeah. At the end of the day, we all want the same. To love and be loved. Why do you have to struggle to get that? Because that's the fun of it, you know? You analyze what works, what doesn't work... I think you spend too much time in your focus groups. And I don't think you really believe that. - Have you read it? - No. It's great. It's about Fitzgerald and Zelda, when they were the big couple of New York. And they ended up badly? Yes. But they did have a great time. Think if they'd known how it would end, they wouldn't have done it anyway? I suppose so. Really? Sometimes it's inevitable. - You get into messes, don't you? - Me? - With the girls. - Oh. More than I'd like to, yeah. And also at work. I've heard you on your cell phone. - Are you spying on me, or what? - It's my job. Mm. No. Yes. Or I wouldn't know when a customer needs another beer. See? - On the house. - Well, then it's fine, I guess. To you. And what do you do? You're too stressed for someone who doesn't wear a suit. - I've got a publishing house. - It suits you. Well, thank you? I'm an actor. Mm, that suits you. Thanks. I act, sing, paint, and dance too. I do performance art. - Performance art, huh? - Mm-hm. Go for it. Uh... - You want my hands here? - Yes. What? Mm. - This is so uncomfortable. - Shh... Um... Uh... Imagine this is an hour and a half. - Your performance is an hour and a half? - Per person. Sometimes it can be longer. Until it happens. Till it happens, huh? Till the person opens up to you. Shows you their true feelings. Oof. You're at that point. - The point of what? - Of showing your true feelings. - No. I'm not. - Yes. What's wrong? - Nothing. - I can see it. It's there. - Uh... - Let it out. - What's the matter? - Nothing. - Yes, you're getting soft. - I'm not. - Let it out. - There's nothing to let out, come on. I can stay here for as long as it takes, and I mean that. - I haven't had dinner, so I'm hungry. - Oh. - Do you like crêpes? - Uh... You play the drums too? Where the hell is the crêpe maker? I played drums for a year. I really liked it. - Hey, if it's a hassle, don't worry. - Not here. Yeah, but you haven't tried my crêpes Suzette. An authentic French recipe. - Hey, Tartufo, where's the crêpe maker? - You lived in France, then? Yes. I used to work on a ferry. Between Marseille and Tunis. Oh. Hm. Oh, and I make a falafel. Amazing. I love falafel. Oh, here it is. - Fuck... - What's wrong? Do you have a roommate? - No. - So? Ariana? Hey. Hi. - Why the heck are you here? - Chill, we're about to leave. - It's not your place? Hey, how are you? - Not anymore. But it is my crêpe maker. This asshole won't give it back. - Who the hell is this dick? - His name is Javier. He owns a publishing house. And... he wants crêpes. I'm actually more into savory stuff. Ariana, leave the crêpe maker and get out. I don't wanna see you anymore. You won't see me, but the crêpe maker is coming. For Christ's sake, the crêpe maker's my mom's! You know how hard it was to get those ABC coupons! Shh! That's emotional extortion. Antonia's my weak spot. How is she? Just great! Now give it back and get out! And you, the drumstick, give it! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey! The crêpe maker! Give it back! Run! You think this is funny? Not bad for a Thursday. Whew. - You have to stop smoking. - I don't smoke. I don't think he's following us. Well, actually... no one was following us. What, then? - I wanted to get you in a doorway. - Hey, wait. Stop, stop, stop. I like someone. See? An hour and a half. An hour and a half. - You took an hour and a half to open up. - Well, yeah, you were right. - I'm in love. - Well, congratulations. - She's my best friend's girlfriend. - Whoa, what a bummer! But she won't be happy with that guy. And why's that? Their relationship has no future. I know it. - Why don't you say something? - To her? No, to him. No way. - He's your friend. - Yes. And you want what's best for him. Yeah, of course. Besides, your friend has a right to know she won't be happy with him. Thank you. We saw a brand-new penthouse apartment, and, well, honestly, it's really not that far. - Where? - Uh... Past Alcobendas. You can get there in 20 minutes. And... You wanna get a drink? But we haven't done 10,000 steps yet. Mm. - Delicious croquettes, hm? - Yes. Lots of great places to eat around here. - And you're looking to buy? - Yes, well... The usual. Buy an apartment, get married, have a few kids. - The usual. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What? - Are you sure? - Sure of what? I don't know, Rober, you used to have plans. - What plans? - Plans. Uh... Travel, see the world, have some adventures. - Hello, Javi, I'm a podiatrist. - And? Some podiatrists travel. Podiatrists of the World. Podiatrists Without Borders. - Open Feet. - Yeah, I had plans like that. You're right. Yes. But now, dude... What I have now is my own practice, I'm with Lucía... - Are you guys okay? - Of course we're okay, yeah. - What's up? - No... No, no, no, tell me what's up. What's up? Tell me now. What's this face? Tell me what's going on. I just want what's best for you, Roberto. - I know that. - You guys seem different to me. What do you mean, we seem different? Just that, you seem different. You used to always be happy and laughing. - Now you bicker constantly. - But it's normal. All couples argue. I don't know. You start to feel like you're stuck in a routine, yeah? - Yeah, but I like a routine. - Yeah, but maybe she doesn't. - But, did she say something? I don't... - No, no, no. But I noticed it. You know women very well, right? - Well, yeah. - But Lucía, you don't. No. Hey, look. It's really none of my business. The truth is I can be quite the moron. My dad has the exact same way too. He won the lottery with my mom, and got comfortable. Well, until my mom sent him packing, of course. Now he spends the whole day on the sofa watching The Mentalist and drinking beer after beer. So don't do what your dad did, Rober. If you want to make a change, you can do it. Right? - You are right. - Yeah? You... are... totally right, Javi. - Javi, thanks. - No, it's nothing. No, no, no, no. Thank you. Thank you, Javi. Javi, thanks. Have you all tried the new tuna escabeche? If so, tell me about the experience. Well, I wasn't able to open the can. It's too complicated. Okay. Anyone else have problems with the packaging? Uh, me. I need a Band-Aid. Esther, can you...? For those of you who were able to try the tuna, tell me... Great. It's great. I really love it, to be honest. - It's the best tuna that I've ever eaten. - Great. - Other brands don't do it for you? - No, it's because I'm allergic. How 'bout we call you a doctor. Since he's coming, might he take a quick look? Nah, you'll be fine. - Uh, Lu. Lu. - Let's carry on. You have a visitor. Hey there. It'll just be a moment. - Forgive me, please. Sorry. - I'm gonna grab... - Roberto? Can't you see I'm still working? - Right, let's get straight to it, then. And take the classic route, eh? Ta-da. - Eh? - What is this? Something I should have done a long time ago. That's so lovely! - Yes! - Go ahead, woman. Say yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Come on, Roberto. You have to come out. No. Then let me in. I said no! I know this seems like the end of the world now, but you'll get over it, man. Just go away. Come on! Roberto, please, remember when you got dumped by Amaya? I was miserable for three years, and didn't love her half as much. If this happened now, then it was always going to. In time you'll realize that all of this... You. I what? You saw this coming. - Hey, come on, I don't... - I didn't see it. I didn't see it coming. Not a thing. And she did give me clues. Because when Lucía's not happy, she's... Well, she starts moving the furniture around and... And the parquet flooring was all messed up from moving the couches around so much. It's okay. It's okay. Okay, okay. Yeah. - Is she still at your place? - No. She went to Esther's. But she'll be back on the weekend to come over and get all of her things and... And I... I'll go to my dad's. The Mentalist. I hate The Mentalist. Yeah, yeah. I don't want to go through this again! - No, you can't leave him. - And why not? Because you love him, and he loves you. Listen, this isn't easy for me to do, all right? Then don't do it. Hmm. Hold that. If you don't mind. No. Put it down. So... did he send you here? - No. I said I was buying linden tea. - He can't have linden. - His blood pressure drops. - It's for me. - I don't like this. - Are you sure you don't want to marry him? Holy shit. I don't know. Truth is, now you said it, if I think about if calmly, then... - No! - But you were gonna buy a place together. No. He wanted to buy a place. I'm happy living in my rental in downtown. He wants to get into debt to live ten minutes from Burgos. What I don't get is why all of a sudden he wants to get married. I talked to him. - And you told him to ask me to marry him? - No, the opposite, but he got confused. Why don't we act like nothing happened, like how it was? Javier, because I don't want the same thing. Jesus. This is all my fault. No, this has nothing to do with you. This has to do with... with the fact that I told him we needed to talk. - But your dear friend won't listen. - Are you sure? How many times have you told him to turn off Calamaro? No. Are you sure this doesn't have anything to do with me? Yes, I am. Hello! - Oh, hey. - Hi. Oh, Javi. - How... How are you? - Good. - How... How nice to see you. - So, yeah, I was just leaving. No, come on. Well... You can't go already if, uh... Well, Lucía's just leaving. Isn't that it? Don't you remember what we had talked about? The thing about the... Excuse me, uh... What? Yeah, so the thing is that... - What? - Lu, go take a walk, okay? - Mm-hm, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - No. No, no, no, no, no. No. Come on, Lu. You're not going great, but right now, I'm worse. - It's been bad for me for much longer. - Oh, it's not a good idea, Esther. - No. - But why? You were the one that said it. He's the perfect fuck to make the transition. And that's it. You have to transition. Look how well our country is doing with the transition... - Esther. - Yeah? The thing is, he's horrible. Hmm? - Well... - And what next? - If you like him, what then? - Yeah, but... - We will get to that point. - What will you do? No. All right, Lucía? Come on now. Please. Go, go. Go for a walk. Javi? Javi? Javi? Javier, darling, the manuscript is in the mail. Sorry it's weeks late, but you know that we... Well, we make books, not sausages. - Well, big hug. I hope you love it. - Not sausages. - So we're going to eat. - Huh? - Javier, you okay? - Yep. - Is that manuscript Sonsoles's? - Huh. And? It's good. You didn't like it. I did. Yeah, sure, I liked it. It reminds me of her earlier works. - But that's good, right? - Yeah. - And what, then? - I don't know. It starts well. Really well. But at the end it goes flat. It's like I'd read it before. Javier... you seem a little lost. Hm. Maybe I am. Maybe what you need is a fresher point of view. You think? A point of view that's... more current. From someone younger. Without prejudice. And who coincides with the profile of our potential readers. It's a pleasure to have you all here for Sonsoles' latest novel, which is absolutely amazing. The title's really catchy, right? Have you all read the... the novel? - I don't know if this... - Trust me. We want to hear them. So what did you think? Did you like it? Can anyone... Yes, tell me. - I felt like it was a little bit long. - Yeah. Same for me. Two hundred pages is long now. - Should we add pictures? - Shush! - Yeah, a little. - Yes. - Mm, okay. - I found a few typos. I took the liberty of marking them up. In case you want to show them. Uh... Yeah. Yes. We need to go over things a little bit better, huh? Okay. Yes. Page 49. - Yes. - Page 73. Seventy-three. Page 51. Well, this one was pretty funny. Oh, she's proofreading the entire book now. My, oh, my. I have to stress that I really enjoyed it, though. I think with this we're good. Yes. If maybe there's something else we could... Pass me that plate, please? The truth is, I was really hooked by the book... For me, it brought up a lot of memories of my childhood things. - Oh... - Oh, great. Yes. Look, I eat a lot too and it works for me. The thing is that you're carried away in it until the end. The problem is the end. You think so? Why? - Yes, yes, yes, because... - No. No. - I don't know what... - I guess it is, a little. - It just ends flat. - Yeah? Like something's missing, right? - Yes, it's like... - An element of surprise. Sure, the thing is, for me, I wanted a surprise at the end. And the ending, for me, wasn't surprising at all. - Totally. - Right? - Now that you mention it... - Like I'd read it before. I agree. And... And with a different ending, would you like it? - Yes. - Yeah. - It probably would make more sense. Yes. - Mm. Well, then. And... how many of you would recommend it? - Oh, sure. - I would too, yeah. Yeah, I would too. Oh, that's great! That's great. Plus, it's a really great novel to give as a gift as well, right? Thanks. - Oh! - Oh! Are you okay? Yeah. Whoa! So, what do we do now? Well, get dressed before Esther gets here. - It's not Esther that worries me. - Yeah, I know. - I feel like a piece of shit. - Me too. - This was bound to happen, though. - I suppose so. I'm sure it was. Hey, wait. If we don't make this a thing, he doesn't have to find out. No. Of course. Anyway, besides, I didn't just leave one relationship to jump into another, you know. I get it, sure. It's the wrong time for anything serious. We won't tell him anything. - Zero pressure. - It's just... Anyway... You and me. It's just really weird. It's best to go with the flow and take things as they come. Mm. This is... This is just a transition fuck going nowhere. Hm. Mm. But it was going somewhere. And I knew exactly where. - You've never been here? Are you serious? - Never. Okay. This is great. Okay? It's so open. Okay, just a few more. That's enough already. I'm embarrassed, and you've got hundreds of photos of me. Go there. Go there. - What do you think? - It's excellent. - Wow. - I love it so much already. - And that? - It's time to celebrate. I'm gonna put in some couches, a projector... And bring in a huge table. Like I never had. And the rest all plants. Plants here, plants here, plants here. Plants here. More plants. Plants in all the places. Can I show you the bedroom? - Oh, just go! - Bye. Good morning. - Come on, get on it. - No, it's okay. - It'll look better. Climb up. - It's fine. But why...? Why don't you...? But it's... Hello. - Hey. - How are you? You startled me. You should give back the keys to that apartment. Right. You're right. I'll pick up the mattress and give them back. Yeah, sure. - How are things? You look great. - Yeah, I'm good. - Let me get you a beer. - At the bar? No, I got fired. Tartufo. - Uh, you forgot this. - Oh, thank you. - Will I find another one of your exes? - Shh. You'll see. Oh. Welcome to your home. Be free and happy. There. Hey, that... Where are you going? Hey. Come on. Whoa. - Nice, right? - Yeah. Yeah, it's lovely. I just hope it's safe. Well, it feels small for me. - Uh, the scaffold? - No, Madrid. As soon as I have the cash, I'm going back to Australia. You lived in Australia? Oh, I flipping love Australia. - You've lived everywhere, huh? - Yes. I was a hairdresser in Thailand. - Really? - A cab driver in Lebanon. - And I was even a model for a day. - Oh, no way. Yes, in Getafe. For orthopedic shoes. What a life you've had. If I told you... - But this is your place, huh? - No. But we're good. I've lived here almost a year. It's as good as mine. Oh, God. No, no, no. Actually, it's a friend's place. What happens is, he spends half the year climbing around the world, and the other half in Madrid. - And you've been a year in this place? - Yes. Already. Well, now that you mention it, last time I spoke with him, he left me a message right before climbing the Matterhorn. The shower's leaking. I don't want to pay someone to fix it. You handle uncertainty pretty well, don't you? Is that a polite way of saying I just don't give a shit? How are things with your friend's girlfriend? - Yeah, no, they broke up. - Mm. That's good. She's yours now? Not yet. But she will be. Whoa. You're crazy. No, no, no, no, it's just sometimes things are very clear, you know? Oh, well, not if it's love. When it comes to love, I actually crush it. - Mm-hm. - No, seriously. I do. When you meet a person, don't you notice the connection? Yes. Yeah, the thing is, I usually get those things wrong. Well, I don't. I know. - On the first date? - On the first kiss. Oh, come on. If what you wanted was to kiss me, you could have said, you know. - I don't want to kiss you. - Sure you don't. No, no, no. So talk to me. You bring me to the scaffolding, get me a beer. - Me? - Oh, God, I got you! - And then you spin me a yarn. - It's not a yarn. Oh, you're sweet. No? Come on, demonstrate it now. All right. What? - Nothing. - What do you mean, nothing? Nothing. That's so strange. That's never happened. So odd, let me try again. All right, then. Try again. Nothing. Nothing, not a thing. Uh... I don't know, I guess when you find the right woman, that's that. It's over. Permanently. Wow. And it turns out I'm that woman for you. - No. - I mean, I like you. - You know, but... Whoo! - N-No. No. I mean, I have a certain phobia of commitment. This part you're playing is fantastic. - Everything you're doing is like, wow. - No, no. It's not you. It's not you. - Oh. - And like that... it's all over. - Thank you. - What? - Thank you. - Of course. Thank you. Roberto... - Hey, what's up? - What are you doing here? Isn't that plant Lucía's favorite? Uh, they're really low-maintenance. How... How are you, man? How are you? I've called you lots. No need to lie. You called me a couple of times. - I'm sorry. I didn't want to see anyone. - No, no, I'm sorry, dude. I'm sorry. Forgive me. I've been crazy busy. I'm not doing too hot, dude. I just can't get over it. I don't know, I can't focus at work. I don't sleep at night. It's a fucking nightmare. Yeah, dude, all breakups are terrible, at the end of the day. - Yeah, not yours. - Of course they are. For the other person. Why don't we go away for the weekend? We can take the car. I'll drive somewhere. Where to? To Granada? No? We went there after Amaya, remember? Mm. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, that was all right, but... - I don't know, dude. - And it'll be better this time. Better this time. It's just that you caught me at a bad time. We'll make plans another day. It's just, now I've arranged to meet someone. - Who? - Um... a girl. Esther? - Yeah. - Mm. Hmm. Um... Come on, dude. Uh... I'm sorry, okay? It's just that I've got a lot going on. - Okay. No problem, dude. - Yeah, I'll see you. Oh, and that plant can't be in direct sun... Wait! Rober, wait. Come on, dude. She was the last one left, hm? At least you waited until we broke up. Thanks. We kissed that night we had dinner with Esther. We were still together. It wasn't planned. I saw it. It was Lucía. She's the love of my life, dude. - That's how it works, that's my thing. - Your thing? Do you just think I'm a stupid idiot? - You have to fucking stop lying for once. - You believed me, though! I just went along with it, dude. Because I thought it was funny. And because we were friends. Hold on. I have a vision now too. I see that you've always been a piece of shit. And an imbecile. And the sad thing is that you'll make her unhappy, like the rest. Roberto was wrong. Hi. Hello. What followed were the happiest months of my life. You happen to sell hake? Should we remove the bones so it's oven ready? Sure. Please. - Don't worry, I don't have many clothes. - Let's see. - No, no, no, don't look at that. - Come on. Put it on for me. - Here. - You already put it on. - Let him see it just for a second. - Delicious, yeah? - Looks alive. It's alive! - No, I don't, I don't... - What happened? - Nothing, don't worry. It's under control. You need to turn the water off! Look, all your clothes. Hello! - Hello. - We now have a new peace lily. Ah, it's so pretty. It's nice out. You wanna go see the exhibit at the Thyssen? You won't like it. But I didn't even say which one. The Magritte. It'll be a drag for you, seriously. Someone's in a bad mood, yeah? I'm sorry, I have work. Just a second. - Hey, Carla. - I've re-read Sonsoles's book. Smells like a classic, right? Hm. Classic indeed. Remember how you felt you'd read it before a thousand times? - The cover? God, I love it. Ahh! - That's good. Because I got 3,000 more that you're paying me for, one by one. - Why? - Why? It's plagiarism! - What do you mean? - You plagiarized more than five books! Don't be stupid, come on. Please. What on earth are you talking about? Do you think I'm a fool or something? No. I know you don't believe in me. Just admit it. Come on, don't go playing the victim now. Sure. Sure. Yeah, so this is why you tried to sign Doñate. Yes, I tried signing Doñate because Doñate sells books. - He's easy to work with, not difficult. - Okay. No. Doñate, the thing about him is that he's insufferable. He writes, not copies! That guy spent 20 years copying himself, writing the same book. Sonsoles, do you really think I can publish this? - No. - Ah. - But of course I copied. - Right. But I just don't know what's happening with young people today. Then why did you write that? Because I have no other stories to tell. Before, well... things happened to me. Stuff still happens to you. No, nothing that's interesting. Readers want your work. And you? Well. You say things don't happen to you. All sorts of stuff happens to her. Who is she? She travels the world, meets people, and gets into trouble. - And I've eaten a pangolin. - What? Uh, and she's not an influencer? No, no, no, no. Hell no. I'm bad in front of a camera. So, well, I'm Ariana, your muse. I like your jacket. - You like it? - Yeah. Sure. I just love your place here, really. Yeah. Surprise. What's wrong? Nothing. Did you say, "surprise"? No. - Oh. - Why? Nothing. Uh, well, come on in. Dinner's in the living room. Surprise! Ah! - Whoo! - Wow! Wow! No, come on. Stop... Make a wish now. - Cheers, come on, go on. - The look on your face... - You weren't expecting that, were you? - No. Not at all. - Well, we have another surprise. - Mm-hm. Here, for you. There's no need, guys. - Happy birthday, boss. - Thanks a lot. DIARY OF A CHICKEN FARMER - Think we'd pay for your present? - And the whole plot is super interesting. I cried so hard when they put the chick in the grinder. - Same here. It's brutal. - It's so dramatic. I loved it, Lu. Really, thanks. You already knew. - No. - Yeah. All right, yes. I saw Rubén's car parked on the corner. You serious? Honestly, I told them not to park there, that there's a parking lot next door. It's all right. It was lovely, really. - Well, hey. - Hm? Happy birthday. Look at that... Look at that... Let's see. Ah... It's two tickets to Marrakesh because I once heard you tell Roberto it was your favorite place. One of your last vacations with your parents. I love it. Hm. - What? - You knew that already? - Me? No. - Come on, I see it in your face. - You already knew. - How could I have known? - Did you check my phone? - Uh, no. So I'm that predictable. Am I that boring? Are you crazy? Lucía, I've never been happier. Yeah, sure, you always say that, but... It's just that every time we do something it's almost... - Almost what? - Almost like you knew it would happen. - That's nonsense, hey. - No. To you, nothing's ever a surprise. - Well, who wants surprises? - Everybody. Uh, no. Do you know what surprises lead to? - Heart attacks. - Javi, come on. It's important to me. It really is. If things get monotonous, it won't work. - I know that from experience. - So our relationship is monotonous? No, but to you, I seem monotonous. I won't be the boring one. Okay, Javi? Let's go to Marrakesh. Let's go to Marrakesh. It's been years since I stayed at La Mamounia. How do you know I booked us at La Mamounia? Because you have exquisite taste? I don't know. Call it intuition. Anyways, the city of Marrakesh, it's always kind of the same, you know? We'll be walking around the Medina, barter for a rug that I could get for 100. You'll make me pay 200, so you don't lose it. I'll recommend the best couscous royale in the world, and you won't listen and order a Caesar salad. I don't know who in Marrakesh orders a Caesar? You'll get food poisoning, and we'll spend the rest of the trip in the hotel. And at the airport, you'll buy a copy of Hello! Carlota Casigari, whatever her name is, leaves her boyfriend. - If you don't wanna come, just say so. - I do want to go. - I think I should just go with Esther. - It's my gift. Look, Javi, we've spent half of our relationship hiding because of Roberto and the other half with each other every day. Some time apart will be good for us. In the end... everything I earned with the saucepan, I lost in the garden because lettuce is unpredictable. Sure, right. Lettuce is unpredictable, yeah. But, you know, I would like to find something a bit more poetic. - Sure. - Could it be something like... Like, something about how nature's uncertainty, uh... led me to chaos? - Yes? You like it? - Hm. - That's good. - All right. Okay. Hm. - Uh, what else? - Mm! And about me being the mayor. Oh, yeah. That's it. Uh, she's a mayor in Australia... Of a really small town. I introduced them to fireworks. And nearly burned it down. - Did you really? - I swear! So it should be, "pyromaniac in Australia." - Doubt they'd let me come back. - Australia. You don't say. - Oh, shit, I have a performance to get to. - I'll take you. Oh, great, you'll finally get to see it. Well, well, well, this girl is the bomb. - Well done. - I'm glad you like her. - And you like her as well. - No. - I have a girlfriend. - Oh. What? - Nothing. - Shall we go? - Thanks, Sonsoles. - You're welcome. Tomorrow, we'll cover Peru and the dead dolphins, all right? - Okay. Well, then. So it was... - Enjoy. See you later. So that was about Peru and the dolphins... - Javi. - Sweetheart, how's Marrakesh? Oh, hello? It's just, I can't... I can't... Watch out, the motorbike. I can't hear you properly. It's just, we're in a little market. - Lucía? - Okay, Esther. We'll check it out later. I said we're in a street market. - What? - Hey. Hey, come look at the rugs. - I love this one. - Can you hear me? That's a lot of noise. - Javi, I can't hear anything. - Two hundred fifty. Uh... I'll do 50. What do you mean, 50? - Wait. Javi, I'll call you later. - No. Yeah, yeah. Why? Uh... - It's just, I... - No, no. I can talk it down. I can, uh... - Fifty, yeah? - For you, and only for you... - Yes. - ...200, and I'll throw in the small one. Two hundred's a great price, you hear me? Uh, one? - Whoa. A hundred... - You're humiliating him. I'm not humiliating him. This is how it is. For you, and only for you, 100 euros, go on. - 100 euros, go on. - Oh, that's great! Shukran! Shukran! Oh, that's great, I love it. Okay, we're gonna think about it. All right? Thank you. - Miss! - There are so many more rugs around here. There's nothing better in the whole market. Hm. Oh. Bravo! Yeah! See you later. You look great. What have you done to me? Performance art. I showed it to you at the bar. Don't you remember? This wasn't like the bar. Well, I did make a few changes. You didn't like it? Is this stuff gonna wash out? - What did you use for blood? - Oh, it's real. You're completely insane. You know that? - No. - Yeah. You're authentically deranged. An absolute wacko. Yeah? Do you want more blood on you? Here, give me the towel. All right. Whoa. - Uh... - What is this? I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - But... - You... You have a girlfriend, don't you? - Yes. Yeah, I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm really sorry. I... I didn't... No, I don't... understand. I don't know. Yeah, with her, I see things clearly. It's great. With you, I don't see anything clearly. That's also great. Oh. Of course. What happens next is... you need to figure things out. Mm... I don't know. Well, I do know. And don't worry, because I'll help you. You need to stop being an ass. If there was any doubt, that night decided everything. I thought about how long I'd waited for Lucía to come into my life. THE BLUE TRENCH TO LUCÍA Now that I was with her, I wasn't going to lose her. I wanted to surprise her. Finally get Doñate to sign her book. Technically, meeting that guy was the first thing we did together. And I thought it would be nice to... Jesus Christ. You really have to ask yourself, so you consider everyone... Of course. I soak him in blood, I introduce him to my ex-boyfriend, I buy him a beer, I take him all over Madrid, I... I show him my scaffolding. Something's wrong with me. What was I thinking. Look, Ariana... When... When have you ever pursued anyone? Explain it... Oh! Never. Never. - Do not do it. - No. What, then? I'm not gonna go after him. - No. - What are we doing here? We're writing a book. And does that book, by any chance, at any point at all, say anything about true love? No. The book is about... It's about other stuff. The book is about... What's the book about, Sonsoles? What's it about? Overall? Specifically, the book is about... Um... Jesus, it's about everything we've been talking about. Well, that girl who travels the world and that... Well, who, um, works as a waitress, uh, a taxi driver, who has also looked after monkeys. - In Melbourne. - Yeah. And that does a ton of stuff that, honestly, I don't care about, at all. - Sorry? - Forgive me. Forgive me. No. - No, no. - It's that, uh... These things you've been telling me about, I've already lived it. I love you, Sonsoles, but I don't think you've protested against the pope. No, I haven't done that. Honestly, I haven't done that. But just thinking about it, it bores me to death. It's just killing me now. - Yeah. - I'm just not there anymore. I'm at another... another moment of my life. - And... - So... Well, tell me this, then. What stage are you at? It's that... Uh, for example, when I start writing... Mmm... I become paralyzed, because instead of writing, I just go and I buy things on the internet. But I have no use... No possible use for any of them at all. And I have to send them back because I don't have any money. Oh, God! I'm such an idiot. And then I have to tell you, a terrible thing happens because when I go to an event, I get drunk. Because I never drink. So I have one sip of something, and it feels like I've had, like, 20. And... I don't know... I'd like to go someplace to meet people that aren't from my world. No writers, editors... It's that... I'm bored of all that stuff. You know? And there's this guy too. Oh, I'm so sorry. It's a guy from Romania. - Who... Who's really sweet. He's... - Really? Because my father left me a house in the mountains. I go to try and fix it up every few weekends. And he helps me. He helps me. And I don't understand anything he says. And he doesn't understand anything that I do. And all we talk about is... is plaster. But you know... Well... The other day I arrived. And he'd installed, right inside the kitchen... the bathroom! Please, would you put in a small little plasterboard divider, you know, for the toaster at least. No, it's just, I honestly... So, I don't want to be a goddamn writer. I just want to stop being this... this "personality," and be just a woman, who's quite normal, a woman who's joyful. Then what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you... Hey, it took me a long time to... t-t-to take those notes. No, no, no, no. Don't do that. It's... Please. That's it. That's what you should be writing about. Those of us who have been to Hell know. We recognize each other through the eyes. And Roberto Molina is... and you are, Roberto, a hero. Roberto, what do you feel when you arrive at a developing nation? Well... Well, a lot of responsibility. Right? Because of course, dry heels, calluses, or, God forbid, calcaneal spurs, are very uncomfortable things whether here or in Cambodia. So, I can safely say without mistake that the feet are the great forgotten when it comes to their health? Without a doubt. Yes. Of course, when you have to walk 15 kilometers to the nearest well... Hm, how do you walk? Hm? On your hands? No. Absolutely. Any questions? - Hello. - Hi. Um, what began your journey from simple podiatrist to being such a benchmark for international cooperation? Well, it's not that big of a... Sorry. Yes. Uh... I had a very comfortable life. Hm? With my practice, my girlfriend, my... Well, I'd put a down payment on an apartment. Right? Yes. But... my heart got broken. Yes. Love has destroyed more lives than napalm. Roberto, can you tell us what happened? Mm... My girlfriend left me for my best friend. Well... if you can call a guy like that a friend, of course. Uh... Hi. How are you? I have more of an observation than a question. When a couple really works out, then nothing can break it up. That is beautiful. Very beautiful, wasn't it? Yeah. What isn't as beautiful is your girlfriend screwing your best friend for months behind your back. Well, maybe... I don't know, just saying... Maybe you'd still be together if you'd listened to her a little bit more instead of being such a loser. - We were going to get married! - And she didn't want to do that! - But you told me she did! - No! You got it all wrong! But your plan worked out marvelously well, huh? I'm really sorry. I messed up. I shouldn't have gotten involved. The last thing I meant to do was hurt you. I'm sorry. Well... As it turns out, things... since then have been pretty good. I can see that. I travel a lot, I help others. But I still love her. And that's why I'm happy to see she's happy with you. Yes. Yes, what? Are you just here to gloat or...? Come on, what is it? - I just want an autograph. - Oh. Forgive me. Come here. TO LUCÍA, TO MANY YEARS ON THE ISLAND OF HYDRA - Honey. - Hello. Mm. - How are you? - Good. How was it? - Good. - Mm-hm? What? Nothing. Go on, tell me. Well... Do you know what happened on the first day? I came across a beautiful rug in the Medina. And I started to barter, and when I'd got it down to 100 euros... ...I walked away because I didn't like it anymore. Oh. And then, on the second day, we found this awful bar. It was horrible. Disgusting. And I wanted to order a Caesar salad because I really had a craving. - Mm. - Big time. - And do you know what happened? - The runs. I didn't order it. But Esther did. And the runs. Nothing happened. It was delicious. But I... I didn't have the Caesar salad. I'm sorry. I messed up your trip. No. It was the best trip of my life. I don't understand. Well, yes, because on the third day, I said... "Look, enough. I don't care. I'm gonna do whatever I feel like doing without thinking or listening to your little voice, every second." Lots happened to us too. We were robbed. Esther... Esther rolled down a dune... ...and twisted her ankle. I took some mud baths in what turned out not to be mud. - What was it? - Don't ask. Gross. We came back on that plane laughing our asses off. It was incredible. Oh, and hold on. That's right. Carlota is marrying her boyfriend. I'm really glad you had such a great time. It's easy, if you let life surprise you. I'm gonna take a shower, okay? Listen, tomorrow I'll be moving these couches around because this house is desperately needing some change. Oh, I forgot to tell you, I saw Roberto. Hm? I saw Roberto. - Oh. - Mm. He's really changed. He's like a different person. Oh, really? Maybe we could meet and patch things up, you know? All right. I'm so tired. I'm turning off the light, okay? Lucía, things got complicated, and I can't make it. Hope it goes well with Roberto, okay? Bye now. - Uh... Hi. - Mm. How are you? I just got a message from Javier. He can't make it. - Javier can't make it? - No. Um... - Oh. - I don't know if you... I'm sorry. "I'm sorry." That sounded really sincere. Touching. Really. I mean, from the bottom of your heart. Look, I'm gonna go because this wasn't a good idea. - No. - I actually wanted to see you. But not if I have to take this abuse. What do you want? For me to say I feel like a piece of shit for falling in love with your friend? I don't know. Well, I'm not sure, but that'd be a start. Oh, God, I'm sorry. Sorry, I got discombobulated too. - I thought Javier would be here and... - Yeah, me too. Sit down, okay? You still haven't told me if you're happy. It's just, I think there's something more serious that we should talk about. - Hm? - Which is this beard. - Yeah. - Awesome, right? What have you been up to? What have I been up to? Well, none of the stuff I used to do. - Have you closed your clinic? - I closed it. I closed the clinic, told everyone to go to hell... Well, well, well, you're gonna love this. Guess where I'm going next month. Where? - Madagascar. - What? Yes. I'm sorry. So sorry. How are you going there before I do? Come on, I'm not gonna live on my own in that shithole penthouse we were looking at. God no. - So you didn't buy that place, either? - No. No. I haven't bought anything. No. I don't want anything holding me back. In fact... - So, are you good or not? - Yes, we're fine. Ah. I mean, it's Javi. Well, yeah, you know him, so there are a few things... Mm... Sometimes it's like, it's... Just surprising him is really hard. Hold on. If you like surprises, I planned a surprise once, a marriage proposal, which was a pretty damn big surprise. Please, can we just never mention that day, like, ever again? I was sure everything was fine, it was gonna be like a movie, that you'd say, "Yes, I do." - You went down on one knee. - I got a slap in the face. - I did not get to go down on one knee. - Yes, a little, yes. - Ehh... I bent one. - It's just... - It hurts. I can still feel that slap. - Oh, God. Jesus. I still look like the asshole. - Jesus. - Oh, you know... - It was cute. - Hm. But it wasn't the right time. It wasn't the right time. It really wasn't. I'm such an idiot. I gotta go pee. Go pee. Can we just hug each other? Is that weird? - I want that. - Yeah. - I really missed you. - Me too. I've spent half my life looking for that big love story. - And I found it. - Almost there, buddy. - But it wasn't mine. - You don't look too excited. Hello. Wait. Oh. That's for him? Thanks. Hey. Look what he gave you. You'd be amazed at all the things you can do when you're not obsessed with finding the love of your life. Mmm... You're so cute and chubby. I started going to talks for more than just the free booze. - Cheers. See you next week, right? - Of course. - I read my colleagues' books. - Hey! I took an interest in how they worked. We shared our concerns. Soon enough, I realized something. VAMPIRES IN MAUTHAUSEN 2 No one has any fucking idea what they're doing. And I was honest, for the first time. With myself and with others. Dear booksellers, readers, and fellow professionals. Here are our options. What do we think? I've always said that Mon FORTE is going from strength to strength. - But that's a lie. - You sure? Things are pretty bad. - Let's print it, then. - And it's all my fault. I haven't released a good book in... Well, I've probably never released a good book. But I truly believe that Sonsoles Durán's next book is amazing. - Let's go! - Whoo! Hopefully we'll go to a second edition, and we can celebrate. Hello. - Hi there. - Hey! it's about time. - How's it going? - They're expecting you. - I'm going. Put this in the fridge. - I'm on it. - How are you? - Hey, man. Congratulations. - Thanks for coming. - Of course. We wouldn't miss this. We brought you a little something. - Oh, you did? - Surprise. Oh, a wedding invite? - No. - What are you saying, a wedding invite? It's from my foundation. We've sponsored some feet in your name. Mm. Oh, amazing. Thank you. - That'll be 50 euros. - Sheesh, I only have 25. - I'll just do the right one, okay? - You're so cheap. Listen up, please. Please, just a... A moment of your attention. Thank you. So, the book has been a hit. And... here's the man who has made it all possible. Javier has a gift. He was able to see in me something that I hadn't seen for a long time. That I'm a writer. Thanks for putting up with me. - That's right. - And above all, for getting me. All right, so now let's all celebrate, 'cause Javier is paying! - Ah... - No, no, no. The book is paying. - The book is. - Yeah. Thank you. Oh, no. Thank you. How are you? - Good, actually. - How's your love life going? Um, stalled. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Well, I brought you a surprise. - Oh, yeah? - Over there. Hey. Hey. You're back. - From where? - From Australia. Oh, no. I didn't go. Yeah. No, I didn't go because I... Because... Because I actually thought, "Ariana, what the hell would you do there again?" And I just couldn't be bothered. But don't worry. With the money from the tickets, I'm self-producing a podcast. I'm good. - I'm sure you are. - Yeah. Well... I hope things go well. - You're leaving? - Yeah. Yeah. But you were here. We could have been seeing each other. Uh, yeah. - No. - No? Look, Javi, I... Truth is that I have... these doubts about things, but... But I know when there's someone I like. I don't need to see the future for me to take the plunge. Yeah. I better go. Bye. Listen, I'm leaving. See you. Wait up. I'll come with you. To where? I don't know. Anywhere.
