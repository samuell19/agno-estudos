(slow dramatic music) (sirens blaring) - Hey, Bobby. Yeah, I gave a report when I was at urgent care, and I gave the officer Michael's gym ID, it was right next to the fire extinguisher. (laughs) Yeah. Slight concussion but he'll be okay. Anyway, it's been a long day. Check in with you tomorrow, okay, bye. (intense dramatic music) (gasping) Help, please! Stop, please! (crying) No, no! No, don't, please! Help! (group cheering) - [Man] Come on, girl. - Come on, Lisa! Come on, you rock. - Go, Lisa. (group cheering) (slow dramatic music) - Yeah! Woo! - Sorry. - No you're not. Take. - Tension on. - Ready to lower. - [Man] Lowering. - [Bobby] Next time. - Bobby, you suck. Let's go, Lisa. - Tension on? (slow dramatic music) (Lisa gasps) - [Abby] Lisa! Oh my god! - You okay? - Thanks. - Uh, so that coulda killed you. - What? Maybe I woulda been a little hurt. - A lot hurt, that's really high. - You wanna know what really hurts? Is that it was Bethany who saved me. - (groans) That still does not make up what she did to you. - Yeah. You know what? Forget Bobby. I need to let it go. - Well, you're still kickin' his butt every time he challenges you on the wall. - (laughs) Yeah, that's 'cause it's so fun. Is that bad? - No, it's awesome. In addition to all the Bobby drama, you had your dad to deal with this year. It's been rough for you. - Yeah. Maybe I need something new. - Well, you could start dating again. - Dating? I was thinking about training for the 10k or something. Come on, you know me, how I drive guys away. - Well maybe if you didn't out climb them. And outrun them, out work them. - Are you saying I should lose to guys more often? - Yes! The cute ones. You can't be everybody at everything. - Well you beat me in that spelling bee that one time. - Oh, in junior high. And I'm pretty sure you still don't know how to spell handkerchief. - Who puts a D in handkerchief? - (laughs) Do you see what I have to put up with? - All right, let's go. - Okay. (soft lighthearted music) (ducks quacking) - Yeah, so then Tolyn's wife goes overboard. - Like she faked her own death? - Yeah. - (gasps) See, this is why I'm never getting married. (upbeat rock music) (people chattering) - [Lisa] Oh, okay. - Okay. (laughs) - Okay. - Now it doesn't? - No, it doesn't. - Let's go. - Stop it. Back of the room, come on. - [Group] Surprise! - Wow. (laughs) - Happy birthday, baby. - Oh, thanks, Mom. I'm so glad you're here. - I wouldn't miss it for the world, now get in here and let's party. - You guys. (laughs) You know it's not my birthday until tomorrow. (laughs) - Well that's why it's a surprise. - Happy birthday, Lisa. - (laughs) Thanks, Ray. Thank you. (laughs) - Happy birthday. I was gonna give you the day off, but instead I got you an expensive gift. You can use it on your next day off. - Ooh. Expensive gift. Who needs a day off? - (laughs) You need rock climbing shoes, right? - I told him. - Are you kidding? Yes, I do! - Hey, I know you, come on. - That is really thoughtful of you. - Wow, bossman's a giver. - Is he? I mean, I'm still waiting on that raise. - Okay, I think I need a drink. (group laughing) - Hey, babe. Did you ever call that nice guy Jerry I met at the market? - Mom! - What, you never know. - You can't push these things. (laughs) - Well, yeah, I try. - Also, I don't really think Lisa's looking for a nice guy. - What? - More into the bad boy type? - You know, Lisa, you try looking online for a guy. That's where I met Ray. - True. Now they're married, they have two beautiful kids. - I have to admit I am jealous. - (laughs) Aren't you nice? - You do have to be careful with online dating though. You never know what you're gonna get. - Yeah, but Abby, you're always so cautious. There are lots of nice guys online. - Well that definitely would've been a better place for you to find your boyfriend, don't you think? (laughs) (upbeat rock music) - Did you really just say that? - Sorry. - Abby, you're too much. - Sorry. I'm just a little mad about what she did to you. - I thought it was damn funny. And true. - Thank you. - That's my girl. - Thank you. And I don't mean to discourage online dating. - Well that's good because I just accepted a free trial on this site. - Yes! See, get some hot guys to take you out for dinner and it'll be fun. - Or there's always Jerry from the market. - Okay, okay. Can we stop talking about guys now? - Oh, it's not that bad. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Lisa ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - Easy going guy. A winning smile to compliment my six-pack abs. (laughs) Yeah. Easy going is easy to lose. Wow. Mr. Wonderful. First name Michael, age 31. Wants kids definitely. Right. (laughs) Completely perfect. (sighs) (slow soft music) (laughs) (camera clicks) See, everyone? I found Mr. Wonderful. (phone ringing) Oh. Hey, Mom. I was just thinking about ya. - Hi, babe. Did you enjoy your party? - It was great. I cannot believe you guys kept that secret. - I know. As much as we all talk, I'm surprised no one spilled the beans. - I know, I don't know how you did it. (laughs) - (laughs) I don't know either. (sighs) Hey. Are you okay with everything? I'm worried about you. - Yeah, I'm okay. I worry about you, too. Next week it's gonna be a year. - It's so hard. Until they find the driver, you know? It's just a senseless death. It's just still such a nightmare for me. - I know. Me, too. (laughs) It's empty without Dad. - You know what though? I feel like getting out tonight was really good for me. I'm gonna try to do it more often. I promise. I mean, how else am I gonna find you a man? (laughs) - (laughs) That's seriously the only thing you care about. - (laughs) Is that so bad? - (sighs) Well what if I told you I met someone? - What? Where, when, tell me everything. - Well let's just say he's Mr. Wonderful, and I'll send you a picture tomorrow. - I can't wait. - Well, it's gettin' late, Mom. I'm gonna get to bed. - I know, me, too. I love you, baby. - I love you, too. Goodnight. - Goodnight. (phones beep) (sighs) (slow dramatic music) (car engine starting) - No, no. No, no. No! (tires screeching) No. No. (tires screeching) No. No! (gasps) (slow dramatic music) - Hey, birthday girl. Who's that? What a hottie. Mr. Wonderful? - Yeah, it's nothing. - Yeah, sure. I'll be right back. I just have to drop these off, but I can't wait to hear about him. - Wait, what? Who is that, who is it? I wanna see. - It's not what you think. - Come on. - (laughs) Okay. All right, fine. Check him out. I'm gonna post it in the group chat right now. - My. He is cute. (soft dramatic music) (computer mouse clicking) - Um, why have you been holding out on me? - What do you mean? - Uh, Mr. Wonderful? That, that, that's what I mean. - You like him? - Uh, yeah. What's not to like? He's very hot. (Lisa laughs) - [Bethany] Admin mode, Lisa. Access computer, yes. - So? Spill. - He's just a guy from online. - How long have you been seeing him? - I'm not. It's just for Mom. - [Bethany] I'm in. Lisa, (laughs) shouldn't leave apps open. Found my Mr. Wonderful. Though I think we can find a better picture. Image, replace. Mr. Wonderful. Are in a relationship. Aww. (laughs) (soft dramatic music) - So, where'd you meet this stud? - Oh, calm down ladies. (laughs) He's just some random guy from an online dating site. - So you have not gone out with him? - No. I just photoshopped a couple pictures of us and I'm gonna send them to my mom so she doesn't worry about my love life. - Well, you should date him. He's gorgeous. - Mm hm. - Let's see his profile. - Guys, I have work to do. - Okay, but you two did look pretty good together. - That's what I thought. - Ah! I knew it! You do like him! - Stop it! (laughs) You're so relentless. - You love it. (slow soft music) (computer beeps) - [Michael] (laughs) Peep Look has detected a posting image from Lisa Clark, view image. I found my Mr. Wonderful. (laughs) - Can we talk? - Oh, I have a meeting. - I shouldn't have been there last night. - Bethany, look, we need to bury the hatchet. We work together. - I'm so sorry for being the other woman between you and Bobby. - (laughs) Look, I wish you luck with Bobby. You know he had cheated before you, right? - Yeah, yeah, he did tell me that. - I need to move on. It's for the best. - [Michael] Well, Lisa's cute. In a relationship. How about work? Extreme Tours & Excursions. - You're a good person. I hope one day I can make up for it. - Well, just keep your eye on him. Don't worry about me. (laughs) - Well, thank you. - Don't thank me yet. You're gonna have your hands full. - I've been through tougher than Bobby. (laughs) (Lisa chuckles) - [Michael] How about places? Conquered a new climb. Someone's in shape. Boulderdash? - Um, anyway, look, I still feel terrible. So if there's anything I can do, let me know. - K. - Ready? - Yeah. A couple more things together and, yeah. - Also, I just saw that you got a new guy. He seems pretty cool, where'd you meet him? (Lisa sighs) - (laughs) There's no new guy. I don't know what you're talking about. - Really? I just saw it posted on your Peep Look page. - What? - No, I didn't post anything. - Uh, it's there. Take a look. - [Lisa] Oh, my god. (laughs) - It's front and center. - I didn't post that. I don't know how that got up there. - You seem to be quite the hot item. - Hot item, huh? (laughs) - Yeah. - It's not what it looks like. - Okay, well, I mean, I'm happy for you, Lisa, congrats. (laughs) - Thanks, Ethan. - Yeah. Let's go to the meeting. Come on. - Okay, uh. Wait. (laughs) Okay. - [Michael] Running at the lake. That's my favorite place to run. (laughs) (deep bass booms) - Oh, I thought your mom posted it? - Yeah, you'd think, huh? But it came from my account so, I don't know, maybe I did it on accident, or I got hacked? - Ew, that is so weird. You definitely need to change your password. - Yeah. I'm gonna take it down and change my password tonight. Anyway, hope you're ready. - Wait, that's not fair! (groans) (slow dramatic music) (women laughing) Come on, loser. No such thing as second place. (Lisa laughs) - Pretty good. (Abby laughs) (slow dramatic music) (crickets chirping) (slow soft music) (keyboard clicking) 79 likes. Not bad, Mr. Wonderful. Too bad we're breaking up. Yup. (people chattering) (soft romantic music) (people chattering) (Michael clears throat) - Oh my god, it is you. (laughs) I'm so sorry. I can't believe you're here. (laughs) So you saw that picture? - Yeah. - How? - The social media app has facial recognition. Wanted me to tag myself. - With your new girlfriend. (laughs) - Apparently so. Seems like my love life's finally picking up. - And it seems that I've found Mr. Wonderful. - Mr. Wonderful, my online identity. So that's how this all started. - So how did you find me here? - [Bobby] Hey, Lisa. - Hey. - Hey. - Is this guy bothering you? - No, he's fine. I'm fine. Thanks. - Okay. - Bodyguard? - (laughs) Ex. - Ah. - Sorry. So, can I buy you a juice or a tea or something? Make up for my cyber-stalking? - Sure. Sounds good. (Lisa laughs) (slow soft music) Oh, thank you. - Hope you like chamomile. It's my favorite. - Oh, mine, too. - Mm. (laughs) So, how did you find me here? - Oh, you mean the internet? (Lisa laughs) I mean, it wasn't too hard after I found out your real name. I found your workplace and, well, your gym. (laughs) - Wow. It is crazy how there's no anonymity anymore, huh? - I know, right? Oh, I'm Michael. Michael Patterson. - Lisa, as you know. (laughs) Lisa Clark. - Ah, so, Lisa, do you care to tell me how I became a celebrity to your Peep Look page? - Oh. I'm so sorry about that. I've taken it down, just so you know. Sort of a long, embarrassing story. (laughs) - Well, I came down here to hear a very long, embarrassing story. (Lisa laughs) Go ahead. - Uh, okay. Well, not to throw my mom under the bus, but she's been so full of anxiety recently about my personal life that I decided to tell her that I have a boyfriend so she'll stop worrying about me. - Well, it's nice that you care about your mom so much. - Yeah. And, I saw your picture on that dating site and I thought you were a good candidate for a fake boyfriend. (laughs) And a little bit of Photoshop later and I had a picture to send to my mom of her happy daughter and her new beau. - Oh, sounds like you did a good deed. - (laughs) The only problem is it went public on Peep Look and I'm still not really sure how that happened. - Well, my mom has posted some unapproved items as well. I mean, parents forever embarrassing us, right? - (laughs) It seems that way, doesn't it? - Yes. Well, I'm sorry to come down here and put you on the spot like this. I just uh, you know, I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't being stalked or used. But, you are very nice and a very beautiful woman. - Oh, thank you. (laughs) Um, so, Michael, I uh, I actually have to get going. - Oh, yeah. Me, too. - It's nice to meet you. - Say, uh, why don't we get together and do something this weekend? - Um, you know, I'm not really looking for something right now. - Okay, I know it sounds a little bit weird but, I mean, you gotta admit, there's something here. - Yeah, maybe there is. (laughs) - Okay. Great. So, I mean, we can just hang out or do whatever you want. It's your call. - Okay. Mr. Wonderful. You're on. - Great. (slow soft music) - A gift basket? Well what does the card say? Wait, so when he found out, he wasn't pissed or anything? - No. He was totally cool with it. - Oh, wow. (Lisa laughs) - And then he asked me out. - (laughs) And now I've heard it all. - I know, it's weird, right? - I mean, it's insanely romantic weird. But look, Lisa, we still don't know this guy. You might wanna check him out just to be safe. - Abby, he's a total gentleman. Plus, he's totally charming. - And he's handsome as hell. Okay, but still. Look, Bobby's a cop, he owes you one. Why don't you have him check him out? - Oh, yeah. He already did. - What? - Yeah. It was at the gym. (laughs) Gave Michael a once-over. (Abby wretches) - Typical. Why don't you just have him run a background check? - Yeah, maybe you're right. - It's the least he could do after what happened with Bethany. - Yeah, but every time I try to talk to Bobby he gets really weird. - Because he wants to get back together with you. - Don't tell Bethany that. - Ah, she deserves it. Look, she broke the code. You never go after a friend's man. It's pretty simple. - Yeah, but it's just as much on Bobby. Plus I'm trying to move past all this. I think this is a good place to start. (Abby groans) - It's probably a good idea. - By the way, I told Michael I'd see him this weekend. I was thinking of taking him running. - Oh boy. (Lisa giggles) Are you sure that's a good idea? Look, you're gonna beat another man at another sport? And who goes running on a first date? - A first date? Jealous. - Oh my god. There is no secrets around here. - That is why this is such a great place to work. - [Lisa] Right. - Sorry. - Thanks. (lighthearted music) So, this is one of my favorite places to run. - [Michael] It's gorgeous up here. - Yeah. All right, I'm gonna pick it up a little bit. First one to the bridge. Don't be mad when I win though. (laughs) - We'll see about that. (Lisa laughs) (lighthearted music) (Lisa panting and laughing) (Michael panting) (Michael laughs) I almost called an Uber to look for you. (Lisa laughs) - Wow. (sighs) - You okay? - (panting) That doesn't happen often. - [Michael] What? You getting obliterated in a race? - Obliterated? (laughs) I was a couple seconds behind you. - Well, one minute and 19 seconds but not that anyone's counting. - (laughs) Right, not that anyone's counting. (Michael laughs) Wow. Good for you. - You know, you almost seem happy that you lost. - You know, to be perfectly honest, I am. - Well, you're a good sport. (Lisa laughs) - I'll take that compliment. (laughs) - Shall we? - Yeah. (sighs) Let's go. - [Michael] Race you back? (laughs) (Lisa laughs) - [Lisa] That was pretty cool. - [Abby] Hey, Lis, how was your date? - So, I went running with him today. - And did you scare him away with your world-class speed? - (laughs) I tried, but he beat me by a lot. - Oh. That's, that's different for you. - Yeah. I kinda liked it. (Abby laughs) - Uh oh. - I know. I even told him I'd meet him for a drink tonight. - Okay, Lisa, we don't know this guy. Remember, we're gonna go slow? - I know, I hear ya. So my place in the morning, right? - Yup, my turn to drive. Have tonight, okay? - Thanks, Abs. (phone beeps) (slow bluesy music) Yeah, I was actually a bit of a track star in high school. - Wow. So that's the first time a guy's beaten you in a race? - It's not the first time. But it's been a while. (laughs) - Oh, god, that's not good. (Lisa laughs) But I'm still here, so. What's up? - It can be a problem though. You know, guys getting intimidated by a certain kind of woman. - Well, I guess I'll need to up my game then. - Your game's just fine. - So is yours. (Lisa laughs) (slow bluesy music) (people chattering) Uh, if you'll excuse me, I have to use the restroom. You'll be okay? - Of course, sure. I'll get this one. - Oh, no, please, let me. - No way. To the victor goes the spoils. - (sighs) Fair. Okay, but I'm getting the next round. Okay. (slow bluesy music) (people chattering) - Hey. I saw you with Lisa. She is a hottie. I know first-hand, she used to be my girlfriend, but she's a first-class tease. You should quit now, you're not gonna get any. - Excuse me. - Hey, I said you're not gonna get any so you should just give it up. - Look, I'm just trying to have a nice night out with a friend, okay? That's all. - You should leave, forget about her. She's my trouble, not yours. - I don't think she's anyone's. - Are you gonna push this issue with me? 'Cause I'll kick your ass if you do. - What's going on, man, you got a problem with me? - I don't know, Buddy, do I? - You know, I'm gonna go and you should probably get some coffee in you. - [Bobby] Hey, don't walk away from me. (Bobby groans) (intense dramatic music) (kicks thudding) (Michael sighs) - Hey, is everything okay? - Uh, you know what, I'll be right back. Hey. Excuse me. There was an altercation outside of the restroom. I hit a guy and he went down pretty hard. I think he's knocked out. Um, here's my business card. I just uh, I don't want any trouble. - Hey! You the one who clocked Bobby? - Uh, yeah, I was just explaining that to the bar manager. You a friend of his? - Yup. - Ah, well, I'm sorry but he took a swing at me first. - So he started it? - Yeah, he was starting to talk trash about my date, Lisa. - His ex, Lisa? - You know about that? - Uh huh. - Well, uh, he didn't like my reply so he took a swing at me, I ducked, and, well, hit him back. He went down pretty hard. Is he gonna be okay? - He's fine. He's had a bit too much to drink tonight. - Well, are you a cop? - Detective. Mind if I take this card? - Please, by all means. - Thanks. - [Lisa] Oh my gosh, what happened to your hand? - Uh. (sighs) Bobby took a swing at me outside of the restroom. - (sighs) Oh my god. Are you okay? - Yeah. I mean, he missed, I didn't. - I'm so sorry, he drinks so much, and then he does stupid things. Hi, are you with Bobby? - Detective Liz Willis. - Nice to meet you. Is Michael in trouble? - No, but I think you two should call it a night while we stay here and sober Bobby up. - Yeah. Sounds good to me. (laughs) - That's a good idea. Uh, thank you, Detective. Goodnight. - You, too. (soft dramatic music) (people chattering) - You know, there's something I just don't get about you. - [Lisa] What's that? - I mean, so far you're pretty amazing. So how come you haven't had a relationship since, what's his name? - A list of reasons. - A list? - Yeah. (laughs) Maybe I'm not so amazing. (laughs) Anyway, it wasn't just Bobby. - You know, I'm sorry I hit him tonight. - (laughs) Don't be. I've wanted to hit him so many times. (laughs) - So what happened between you two? - Well, he thought I wouldn't mind if he slept with other women every time he got drunk. - Ah, and I'm going to say that he was wrong. - Yes, very wrong. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Bobby's a good cop, he's not a good boyfriend. So, what about you? Any recent relationships? - No, none recent. But I sure have had my share of failed relationships. - Oh. So where'd you grow up? - All over the place, actually. - Really? Were your parents in the military? - Nothing cool like that. I, uh, I was adopted. So I got shuffled around a lot. - That must've been hard. - Yeah, well it's in the past. - So do you know your real parents? - Barely. My dad was a drug addict, and my mom, well, she was a loser. - I'm so sorry. - Don't be. I'm not them. Besides, I always say if you live in the past you'll be depressed and if you live in the future, you'll be anxious. - Right, so live in the present. It's a gift and that's why they call it the present. - Ow, that is a good one. May I say that this present is outstanding? (crickets chirping) Here. To you and to me. May all our time together be this amazing. - Well, I don't know about that. (laughs) - You know, Lisa, I mean, I find you stunning. - (sighs) You're moving kinda fast. - I'm sorry. I mean, if you don't feel the same way, I, I... - I didn't say that. (slow soft music) (crickets chirping) - Well, good. Because I really like you and that hasn't happened for me in a long time. - Me, too. (both giggle) I mean, I kinda like you, too. (Lisa laughs) - Kinda. (slow soft music) (crickets chirping) - Hey, Nina. - Hey. - You joining us tonight for a drink? - Yes, I am. Looks like everyone's at happy hour already. - Yeah. It's just you and me. It's kinda creepy around here when it's just us. - Uh, yeah, I guess. But at least we have each other, right? - Yeah, we do. I have to finish up some work before I go. - Yeah, me, too. I'm just wrapping something up and then I'm outta here. - What are you working on? - Uh, just my true crime stuff. I'm still looking into Lisa's father's hit and run. - How's that going? - I don't know. I've never actually solved a case before. So, I mean, all things considered, okay. - Well, you'll solve one soon. I'm sure of it. - Maybe. I'm still lacking a few big details. It's just difficult to get all the information when it's my hobby. You know? Sometimes I wish I was a cop, so I could see all the big databases. - You're funny, Nina. (laughs) It's after hours, we have friends waiting for us at a bar, and you're researching unsolved crimes. - I know, I'm a crime nerd. - Yeah, that you are, Nina. Well, I'm gonna wrap a few things and get going. - Me, too. I'm just waiting for a reporter to send me a file on the case and then I'll head out. (computer chimes) Oh, there it is. Okay, I'm just gonna take a quick look at this and then I'm outta here. (soft dramatic music) (mouse clicks) (computer beeps) (mouse clicking) Man killed in hit and run. Only suspect in possible murder-suicide. Michael Patterson? That's Lisa's guy. - [Bethany] Admin, Nina. Access, yes. (computer beeps) Hmm. Chicago man questioned in wife's death. That's so wonderful after all. (mouse clicks) (computer chimes) (mouse clicks) (computer chimes) (Nina heavily breathing) (slow suspenseful music) - Hey, Nina. You okay? - Uh, yeah. (laughs) I'm fine, I just have to run. Bye, Bethany, I'll see you at the bar. - Bye, Nina. Be safe. (slow suspenseful music) (mouse clicking) (people chattering) (upbeat music) - My specialty is search engine optimization. I'd be happy to take a look at if for you. - How much would something like that cost? - Ah, I'd do it for free. It wouldn't take very long. - What? - That would be incredible, Michael. Bethany does all of our IT and SEO is not really her strength. - Not a problem. I'll take a look at it. - Uh, Lisa, can I talk to you later? It's important. - Okay. Sounds serious. - Uh, yeah. - Hey. We have some beers for the guys. - Thank you. - Ah, yes to beer. - And champagne. - Cheers. - Thank you. Hey. That's great. (laughs) - [Bethany] Cheers? - [Ethan] Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Mm, this is a great song. You have to dance with me. - That's okay. - Come on, it'll be fun. - It's not really my thing. - Nina's the dancer. - Oh, okay, well, Nina, you wanna dance? - Uh, sure, if it's okay with Lisa. - Of course, go. - Lisa, is it okay? - It's okay. (laughs) (upbeat rock music) - Well he's great. - I'll say. - Yeah. - Wow. He is a good dancer. (Lisa laughs) - Amen. I've got to be honest, I'm feelin' a little insecure over here. - (laughs) Oh, come on, Ethan, you're awesome. - Not like that guy. - (laughs) Wow, he is a good dancer. - He is. They look good together. Lisa, don't you think? (upbeat rock music) - [Abby] Oh, wow. (gasps) - Um, getting (laughs) a little too close for comfort. Okay, sorry. Geez. Ethan, come on, let's dance. - You would never ask. - Of course, let's go. - [Ethan] Yes. - Hey. Forget her. - Oh, it's not Bethany. - Wait, are you jealous of Nina? - Oh, I hate feeling like this. - Okay, look, when you really like someone, it's normal. - Who says I really like him? - Your face. Lights up like a Christmas tree every time you see him. - Is it that obvious? - Yeah. - (laughs) I don't know, I think I'm gonna go back to being lonely. - [Abby] Oh, come on. (upbeat rock music) (Lisa sighs) What's wrong? - Uh, I just got a little headache. - Are you okay? - Yeah, fine. I think it's just too much wine. - Did you want me to take you home? - No, I'm fine. - Okay. - Wow. - Oh. Hey, Lisa, your guy can really dance. (Lisa laughs) - (sighs) You miss me? - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just a little lightheaded from the dancing. - Lord, Nina, what's going on? - Uh, nothing, sorry. - What are you doing? - Um, nothing. - Lisa? - Are you all right? - Uh. No, I'm fine. I'm sorry, guys, I'm sorry. I'll be right back, sorry. - It was. Is she leaving? (upbeat rock music) - (sighs) That was fun. Okay, um, can I get another drink? - I'm down. This round's on me. Who wants one? - I am good. - Same here. - Thanks, I'm fine. Is she gonna be okay? - I hope so. (people laughing) (music warping) - [Bethany] Come here, Lisa. Shots are on me. (group laughing) Lisa. (phone buzzing) - [Lisa] Hey, it's Lisa, you know what to do. (voicemail beeps) - Hello, where are you? You're like super late. Cocktail flu get ya? Call me back. (sighs) (soft suspenseful music) (phone ringing) - Nina. (soft suspenseful music) Nina. Wake up. Nina, what's wrong? (intense dramatic music) Help! (Lisa crying) Help! Help! (Music) (police radio chattering) - Hello, Miss Clark. Can you tell us what happened here? - Um, I woke up with Nina's phone buzzing. I'd been out cold. And, uh, my head was splitting and I then felt this bump on my head. - So you're telling us you have no idea how your murdered friend was lying next to you. (slow dramatic music) - [Bethany] Hey, where's Lisa and Nina? - I have no idea. I left messages for both of them. - Strange. - Wait, did you take either of them home last night? - No, not me. I was feeling a little loopy so I called an Uber. - Yeah, definitely got a little crazy last night. - (laughs) Yeah, I can't quite remember all of what happened. - Same here, it's so strange. - Hey, listen up. I need a moment. God, I can't believe this. - What's wrong? - Nina. - What? - She's dead. I just got off the phone with police. They were attacked outside the bar, and Lisa's hurt, too. (Abby sighs) (slow dramatic music) - Wow, that is a nice size bump on your head. - I'm still pretty out of it. - [Michael] Do the cops know what happened? - They just said that I was lucky to be alive and that Nina was in a struggle before she was killed. - Do they know who with? - No. And I can't remember. - Wait, you don't remember what you did last night? - No, what do you mean? - You were doing shots with Bethany and then you got into a heated argument with Nina. - I argued with Nina? - Yeah, I mean you were pretty worked up about it. Maybe I shouldn't have been dancing with Nina. I... - Excuse me. I need to speak with Lisa for a moment. - Uh, yeah. Of course. I'll be right over here. - Okay. - You are the key witness in this case, and you are also our main suspect. You understand? - No. I really don't. What, it sounds like you think I did this. - I'm just being transparent with you, Lisa. Once we process the evidence, dust for fingerprints, and run toxicology and DNA, we'll get a clearer picture. - Okay. (soft suspenseful music) - [Lisa] Hey, Mom. - [Barbara] There you are. - [Lisa] (laughs) What's for breakfast? I'm starving. - Well that's a good sign. You feeling better? - Physically, yeah. Was dreamin' about Nina all night. - Yeah, that's understandable. Listen, I got eggs and there's fruit. Come on. - Oh, thanks. I think I might go into work today. - Yeah? So soon? I mean, you sure? - Yeah. I just feel like it would be good to do something that feels normal, like sitting around the house all day, watching TV isn't normal for me. - All right. Well, I mean, I think that'll be okay. You know, get back into your routines. Be good for you. - Yeah. (doorbell rings) I'll get it. (slow soft music) (handcuffs clicking) (soft suspenseful music) - Mom. - Lisa. - I'm sorry, I thought it would be better if she knew the arresting officer rather than have a stranger put the cuffs on you. - Bobby, I'll take her from here. I'm gonna bring her by the precinct. - Just let her know where I am, okay? It's gonna be okay, Mom. - Let's go. - Bobby, what happened? What changed? - Lisa's fingerprints were on the murder weapon that we found at the crime scene. - What? - I'm sorry, Barbara. (slow dramatic music) - Are these really necessary? - I don't know, are they? - No. (soft suspenseful music) - Miss Clark, let's just talk for a bit. (soft suspenseful music) - Do I need a lawyer? - You tell me. - I'm innocent. - If you're innocent, how did your fingerprints end up on the knife? - (laughs) Look, I know it looks bad. - Yes, it does look bad. And then you're telling us you have no recollection of what happened. Miss Clark, you need to tell us what happened, or you are going to jail. - I'm trying to remember. - The DA will consider this an open and shut case. Do you understand that? - Yes, yes I understand what it looks like, but I didn't kill anybody. - Miss Clark, we hear that every day. That's not a defense when your fingerprints are on the murder weapon. - Oh, god, what am I gonna do? - Miss Clark, maybe you weren't in the right mind? You know, people with drinking problems do all sorts of crazy things. - I don't have a drinking problem. I'm a social drinker, that's it. - Social drinker who blacks out? - I don't know if I blacked out, I'm not sure exactly what happened. - Well, then maybe I can refresh your memory for you. You killed Nina with a knife to the chest after a heated argument at the bar in which everyone was witness to. And then, you were so drunk you passed out next to the body, and here, we confiscated the butcher block with the missing knife from your kitchen. Murder weapon is a perfect match with that missing knife. Miss Clark, what do you have to say for yourself? - No. No, no. I didn't kill Nina. I didn't do it. Okay? She was my friend. Nina was my friend. - Most murders are committed by someone who knows the victim. - Well that's not the case. I didn't kill Nina, so stop pushing me to say that I did. I may not remember what happened that night, okay? But I know who I am, and I know what I could and couldn't do. - Show us your arm. - Why? - The medical report said you have scratches on your arm. We'd like to see those scratches. - (laughs) I don't see how that's... - Show us. (slow dramatic music) Pull up your sleeve. Let's see it. - It's not what it looks like, all right? - Hey. What do you say we just take this nice and easy? Okay, Lisa? Just tell us the truth about what happened the night Nina died. Unburden yourself, and we will tell the DA that you cooperated with us and things will go smoother for you. (sighs) - Detective, you have it all wrong. I didn't kill Nina. I didn't hurt her. (slow dramatic music) I didn't do it. - [Abby] How are you feeling today? - It just feels good to be outside. - I'm glad you're finally home. - Yeah, took a while. Thanks again for the help with the courts. And the bail. - And that fancy new ankle bracelet I got to buy you. (Lisa groans) - So what's the deal with that thing? Are you allowed to go anywhere? - Oh, I have a small radius I'm confined to. My house, mom's, work. - My place? - Yes. And our running trail. - Well that's not terrible. Besides, it is a very good look on you. (Barbara laughs) - Yeah, prison chic. - Uh, so I talked to Ray the other day. He's having a pretty tough time. - Ray? - Nina's husband. You met him. - Right. - I feel so awful. I hope he doesn't blame me for any of this. - No, I don't think he does. It's just all so confusing, nobody seems to know anything. - Maybe you should go see him. - Yeah. I think I will. - Well I have some groceries to unpack, so. - What can I do? - No, no. You sit and relax. I will help Abby. (birds chirping) (sighs) (slow dramatic music) (c) - Hey, can I get you another drink? - Oh, yeah, but get me something different. The champagne tasted funny. - Sure. (slow suspenseful music) - Oh. - Hi, Lisa. - Bethany. (laughs) What are you doing here? How'd you get in the backyard? - Oh, I knocked at the front door but no one answered. I saw your car. - Oh. - [Bethany] So I came around back. (laughs) - Okay. - I was so worried about you. Are you okay? - Um, I'm fine, yeah. I just, I'm having a hard time remembering what happened. - Well, get some rest. I'm around if you need anything. (sighs) I'm sure you'll remember. - You know, it hard. The police think that I killed Nina. They say it's an open and shut case. - Hey, baby, you need anything? Oh, I didn't realize you had company. - Um, Bethany, from work. She just stopped by. - Oh, right. You look so familiar. Have we met before? - At my party, Mom. Remember. - Yeah, I remember that, but (stammers) no, I know that I know you from somewhere. Are you sure that we didn't meet somewhere else before? - Uh, no, no, not that I recall. But, (laughs) I mean you never know, right? - It's killing me. I'm gonna remember, I am. I never forget a face. - Lisa, I, I should run along now, I have a couple errands, before it gets late. - Okay, well thanks for stopping by. - Okay, I'll see you at work. Bye, Barbara. - Bye, Bethany. (slow dramatic music) - [Liz] So help us get this straight. You've only know Lisa for a week or so. - Correct. Yeah, we met sort of through an online dating. - How many dates did you have? - Um, just the one dinner at her house and then the bar that evening. Unless running counts as a date. - So you really don't know Miss Clark well enough to say she didn't commit this crime? - Uh, well I guess you're right. But I still think there's no way that she could've done this. - Is that your expert opinion? - It's just my opinion. - You got into an altercation the previous night at the bar. - Yes. - Every time you're in that bar, something bad seems to happen. - What are you saying? - Officer Bobby Blake has bruising on his ribs and stomach area. You said you knocked him out with one punch. - I did. Maybe he fell on his ribs. - (chuckles) You lived in Chicago before you came here. - Yes. - And it says you're married. - Widowed. Her name's Michelle. - She committed suicide two years ago. - She struggled with depression for years. Okay, I came home from work one day and the police were there. It was awful. - I'm sure it was. - Where are you going with this, detective? Do you have any evidence stating that I've done something wrong? - Only circumstantial. You see, in the two nights you've been in that bar, you've been involved in an assault and a murder. - All right, I was not involved in a murder, and Bobby took a swing at me. It was self-defense. You know, I'm done talking to you. If you have anything else to say, you can call my lawyer. (slow dramatic music) - Yeah, so if you could grab that for me, that'd be great, thanks. (laughs) Hi, Ethan. - Lisa, we are so glad you're back. - It feels really good to be here. - I'm just grateful that you got out so quick. God, I feel awful that I ended up leaving early that night. - Well don't. Who coulda known? - It's horrible that they suspect you. I mean, your fingerprints on the knife? You think somebody's trying to frame you? - I think I was drugged. - Like a roofie? - Yeah, I mean, I don't know, (laughs) I can't remember anything. - Have you tried backtracking your steps? - Yeah, I'm doing that. - Anyway, um, I still need that cost breakdown and an analysis on the Kilimanjaro trip. - Yeah, I'll get that out right away. - Thanks. Also, you and Nina shared some accounts, right? Could you take those over? - Yeah, sure. I'd be happy to. - Thank you. Thank you. Bethany will help you get logged into her computer. Thanks. (sighs) - Use the admin override and voila, you're signed in now. Whatcha doin' here? - I'm just taking over some of the accounts. - Oh, okay, well, let me know if I can pick up any of the workload. - Oh, (laughs) that's okay. I think you probably have enough to do with the IT stuff, and it shouldn't be tough. - Okay. (sighs) (soft dramatic music) (mouse clicking) - Oh, wow. - What's up? - Oh, hey. - Hi. - I'm just retrieving some of the accounts and files from Nina's computer. Did you know about her crime story fascination? - (laughs) A little bit. Why? - She has a huge amount of material dedicated to it. Here's one she highlighted. - Teen's ID withheld in murder charges in death of mother's boyfriend. Uh, that's uh, yeah, that's a little disturbing. - Yeah. Hm. Hit and run. (phone ringing) Oh my god. - It's your dad's hit and run article. - I've never seen this one before. I'm gonna print these. - I'm so sorry, Lisa, I have to get back. But please let me know what you find, if I can help you with anything. - Okay. Thanks, Abby. (slow dramatic music) (crickets chirping) (doorbell rings) Hey. - Hi. - Flowers? (laughs) Aren't you sweet. - Well, welcome back. Ah, it smells great in here. - It's Chicken Marbella. Are you goin' somewhere? - Oh, yeah, I'm gonna check into a hotel tonight. - Oh, a hotel? What happened to your place? - Oh, it's been so crazy, I haven't had a chance to tell you. I sold my house. You know, but the buyers wanna accelerate the move-in process so we're fumigating this week and will take possession next week. - Oh. That's abrupt, I didn't even know it was on the market. - Yeah, I had mentioned it. Anyway, I'm looking for a rental over the next couple days, but until then, it's hotel living for me. - Oh. So, let me see if I understand what's going on. You're homeless? - Yeah, that's one way to look at it. (laughs) - Well, I have a guest room. - Oh, no, come here. I wouldn't expect that of you. (crickets chirping) Hey, are you okay? - Sorry, it's just been a hard time. Trying not to panic about this investigation. - Yeah, must be really difficult. - To say the least. (laughs) And, you and I, I think we might be taking things too fast. - Right. Which is why I'm gonna stay in the hotel tonight. I know you have a lot going on. - I'm just gonna put these in a vase. (laughs) - I love the candles. So, what's cookin'? - (laughs) Sorry, that's just what my dad used to ask my mom, all the time. What's cookin'? (laughs) Anyway, I already told you. - Oh, yeah, right. Chicken. - No, not just chicken. Chicken Marbella. (laughs) Oh my god, we sound like an old married couple. (laughs) - (laughs) We are not old. - Funny. Pump the brakes, Mr. We're Not Married Either. - It's not what I meant, but, okay. Hey, uh, you say your dad's been gone over a year now. What happened? - I don't really wanna talk about that right now. - Hey. - (gasps) Ow. Hey, Nina, where are you going? - Hey, Lisa? - Yeah? - Um, you know what, I gotta get outta here. I got a work thing in the morning. - Okay, see ya. Whoa. - Whoa, hey. - [Lisa] Ow. - You okay? Oh, I'm sorry. What's wrong, are you okay? - Did you scratch me? Did you, did you do this? - I didn't do that. - No, outside the Shanty. I stumbled and you caught me and, but you scratched me. - Yeah, but not really. Not like how your arm is now. - (laughs) You didn't tell me about it. - I didn't think it was relevant to what was going on. - I just got arrested for murder for having these huge scratches on my arms. You don't think that's relevant? - Okay. Please, just calm down. - I'm not about to calm down. Don't you understand I could go to jail for the rest of my life for this? - Okay. - Calm down? - Hold on, Lisa, I'm sorry. - Is there anything else you wanna tell me about that night? - No, and for the last time I didn't gouge your arm like that. - How did you know to come by the crime scene the next morning? - I called the office. What the hell. You don't think I had something to do with Nina and what happened? - I don't know what to think, I really don't. - Okay, maybe you need to take a step back before you say something you're about to regret. - Bobby called me today and he told me that he thought you kicked him in the ribs after you knocked him out. - Yeah, well, that doesn't make me a killer. Okay, I just got set off. - Are you married? - What? No, you don't even know the half. No, not anymore. - (laughs) And you didn't tell me about that. Do you get how shady all of this is? - Lisa, look, you don't even know me. Okay, you need to give me a chance. - Clearly I don't. Clearly. I think you need to leave. - Fine. Fine, Lisa. Forget this. You know what? You're clueless anyway. Okay, getting some half-truths from some crazy ex-boyfriend who's got a drinking problem, who's dating one of your friends. I mean, like you have no issues. - Go to hell. - Yeah, nice. You know what, don't forget I don't know you either. Okay? And you're the one wearing an ankle monitor bracelet for murder. - Get out. (slow dramatic music) (door closes) (ducks quacking) (slow soft music) It's just killing me that I can't remember everything. - I'm aware of all this, Lisa. - I know. It's just really important to me that you know that I had nothing to do with your wife's murder. - I don't think that for a second. Nina loved you and she was a good judge of character. - Thank you. You have no idea how much that means to me. Hey, uh, I found these files on Nina's computer. It's my dad's hit and run case. Do you know anything about it? - Of course. She was passionate about it. The whole thing broke her heart. I was just hoping that the discovery could bring you some closure. - What do you mean? - Nina was so excited, she had never actually solved a case before. - These files don't mention that. - I figured she told you. Isn't that why you called me? - No, she never told me that she solved the case. - But she called me on the way to the Shanty that night to share the news with me. - Oh my god. Did it ever occur to you that this could've been why she was killed? - No. She never told anybody what she was doing, she barely even talked about it with me. I figured she told you because it was your father's case. - Ray, does this mean you know who killed my father? - All she told me was that she figured it out. It was brief. She didn't tell me who did it or why. And that was the last time I ever talked to Nina. (slow suspenseful music) - Hey. - Hey, thanks for meeting. - Yeah, of course, Lis. I'm really sorry about Michael. Told you you can't trust anyone you meet on the internet. - Yeah, it's really disturbing. Like, if he's lying about that then what else is he lying about? - You never know, I mean you just met him. So you think going back to the place where Nina was killed will help jog your memory? - I don't know, but I have to try. This is it. - Right here? You and Nina? This is where it happened? - [Lisa] Yup. (music warping) (voices echoing) - [Nina] Lisa, help. Lisa. Help me. No, no. Lisa! (dog barks) - [Abby] Anything coming back to you? - Yeah, a little. - It is so creepy knowing that Nina died here. (sirens blaring) - Crap, come on. - Lisa! I know you're there, I've been tracking you on my phone. Who's with you? - It's just me and Abby, sorry. - What are you two doing out here? - Trying to remember what happened. - Any luck? - Well, there's one thing for sure, I was definitely drugged because I've never felt like this before from drinking. - Well, you're right, toxicology came back this afternoon. You were drugged. It was a sedative with hallucinogenic properties. - So that proves I'm innocent. - Not exactly, but there is one other thing I'd like to check on. Show me your hands again. (soft dramatic music) Clearly you haven't had a manicure in a while. - Not in a while. - A long while. - Well, your nails, or lack thereof, might be the best evidence you have going for you right now. - How's that? - An acrylic nail was found embedded in Nina's arm. - [Bobby] Hey, Liz, everything all right? - Yeah, I'm just dealing with Lisa and Abby. I found 'em wandering around out here. Look, I have to run and you do, too. You are outside your restricted area. Violate it again, you will regret it. - What are you guys doing out here? - Looking for clues. Trying to jog my memory. - Just so you know, those fingerprint matches, I mean, it's the strangest thing but I never believed any of it. - Thanks, Bobby. - You break up with your boyfriend? - Yeah, you wish. - You said he was married. He said I didn't have the whole story. So what didn't you tell me? - His wife is dead, how's that? - How'd she die? - Suicide. You know, I think he's the one that did this. - What? Why would he kill Nina? - He wants Lisa to live in fear. It's easier to control you that way. - I doubt it. - What about your girlfriend? What do you know about her? - What's that supposed to mean? - Well, she was here the night of the murder, did you run a background check on her? - Did I? No. - How well do you know Bethany anyway? She moved her from Pennsylvania like a year ago, right? But with no family here, isn't that kinda mysterious? - Why, you jealous? - Abby is right, you should know who your girlfriend is. - Girlfriend? - Wow. - [Lisa] Nice. - Bobby? What are you doing out here? - Nothin'. Coming. Yeah, all right. I'll check her out. - I hate that guy. - [Lisa] Hey, it's Lisa, you know what to do. (voicemail beeps) - Hey, Lisa, it's Michael. Um, listen, I wanted to say sorry for the things that I said last night. I said a lot of things that I didn't mean and, well, I'm sorry for that. Uh, I was hoping maybe we could grab some tea and well, I could apologize in person, if you'd forgive me. Anyways, uh, thanks. (phone beeps) (slow dramatic music) (horn honks) (phone chimes) (slow dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Lisa. - Hey, Ethan. I'm sorry to call you so late. - No problem, I'm leaving a business dinner. Workin' on that expansion. - You're a driven man. (laughs) Uh, hey, I have a big favor to ask of you. - Shoot. - I need to swing by the office and it can't wait till after the weekend. - You got the keys, go ahead. - The thing is I need to get something off of Nina's computer and I don't have the password. - (sighs) It's at the office somewhere. I'll tell ya what, it's on my way home. I'll just meet you there. - Right now? Are you sure? - It's important, right? - It could be very important, yeah. - Okay, I'll see you in a bit. - I adore you, thank you. (phone beeps) (suspenseful dramatic music) (light switch clicking) - That's weird. Lisa, is that you? Hello? Is anybody there? (suspenseful dramatic music) (Ethan groans) (suspenseful dramatic music) - Ethan? I'm here. (suspenseful dramatic music) (Ethan groans) Oh, no. (Ethan groans) Ethan, oh my god. Are you okay? - My head. - What happened? - I don't know. I heard a noise, I was looking around, and then bam, somebody hit me with something. - Looks like a fire extinguisher. Here, come on, let me get you up and into a chair. (Ethan groans) Get you some ice. (slow dramatic music) Ethan, I feel awful. Hey, come on, we gotta get you to an urgent care. - Okay, um, I think I dropped my keys by the fire extinguisher. Would you mind grabbing those for me? - Yeah. - Thank you. (Ethan groans) (slow suspenseful music) - Hey, Bobby. Yeah, I gave a report when I was at urgent care. I gave the officer Michael's gym ID. It was right next to the fire extinguisher. Yeah. Slight concussion but he'll be okay. Anyway, it's been a long day. Check in with you tomorrow, okay, bye. (keys rattling) (intense dramatic music) (Lisa gasps) (Lisa panting) No! No, stop! Please! (tires screeching) Help! - Freeze, drop it! (gun firing) (slow dramatic music) Are you okay? (mouse clicking) - Admin, yes. Investigation into the death of local man. It's gotta be Lisa's dad. Oh, god, this again? (mouse clicking) Recover files. Yes. Convicted murderer gets early release for good behavior, sentence cut in half. Marie Dixon. That's Bethany. (intense dramatic music) Lisa! (pounding on door) Lisa, I need to speak with you. - [Abby] So wait, who saved Lisa? - The detective tracked her from the urgent care facility, because it was outside of the restricted zone. That GPS on that ankle bracelet saved her life. - That is so frightening. - Yeah. - I still can't believe what a crazy person he turned out to be. - Morning. (laughs) Hey, Ab. - Well good morning. Even though it's almost five o'clock. (laughs) - I'm glad you finally got some rest, babe. - Yeah. I'm feeling better. I saw a squad car out front. - Oh, yeah. We have police watching us 24/7. - They're gonna get him, Lis. He still doesn't know that you found his ID card. (Lisa laughs) - [Michael] Lisa! - Freeze, Patterson. Unless you'd like to try your luck with me again? I'm in a better mind to kick your ass this time. (slow dramatic music) (Michael sighs) - I just can't stop wondering why Micheal would kill Nina. And does it have anything to do with Dad's hit and run? - Give it some time, Lis. Thank you. (knocking on door) - Hey, Ethan, come in. - Hey, Barbara. - Are you? - Yeah, you okay? Oh my gosh. - Are you okay? - Ah, yeah. Doctor says I'm fine, I'm just sore everywhere. Hi, Abby. - Hi. You okay? That looks really painful. (Ethan laughs) - Question is how are you feeling? Police had me give a second report. I had no idea where you went after I left. Freaked me out. - I'm fine, (laughs) I'm fine. (knocking on door) - Can I come in? - Hey, Bobby, come on. - How you feelin' today? - I'm still here. Any news? - We got Michael Patterson. I busted him at your front door. He was trying to see you, I guess. - Okay, that's creepy. But that's good. - Yeah. There is one other thing. - What's that? - I don't know if it's related, but it's not good. - What? - I did some digging. It's Bethany. She ain't Bethany. She changed her name. Turns out she was locked up on a murder charge for 25 years. Got out early for good behavior. - What? - Wait a second. What was her real name? - Marie Dixon. - Oh my god. I thought she was still in jail. - You know her? - Yeah. Marie Dixon is my husband's daughter from his first marriage. - What? - Daddy's ex-wife was a drug addict. And she left him for another man and she took their baby daughter, Marie, and moved away. - What, you never told me all that. - I wanted to. I tried. I was gonna tell you, and then Marie went away to prison for a long time and it just didn't seem like there was any point in telling you. She was gone, and she wasn't coming back. - But she did come back. - Clearly. I never met her. I saw childhood pictures of her. I knew I recognized her. God, I told you I never forget a face. - Yeah, you did. - It's so sad. She grew up in such a toxic environment. And, she was always in trouble, she always blamed your father for everything, and then one night, her mother overdosed because of the boyfriend and they say that Marie, Bethany, she just lost it. She killed him. - Oh my god. - No way. - How old was she? - She had just turned 17 and clearly it was premeditated. They tried her as an adult and she went to a maximum security prison. (slow dramatic music) ves here? To do what? - Wait a second. When did she get out? - [Bobby] About a year ago. - [Lisa] That's when Dad was Killed. - [Guard] Sign here and you are free to go. - Why would she kill her father? - Because she blamed her father for everything bad that ever happened in her life. - This is all speculation. - Well Ray said that Nina had figured out who did the hit and run. - [Abby] And then she got killed for it. - [Bobby] But where's the evidence that she did any of this? - [Lisa] It may have died with Nina. - Bye, Bethany, I'll see you at the bar. - Be safe. - Could Bethany have been the one who stabbed you last night? - [Lisa] Maybe. Maybe it wasn't Michael. - I talked to Bethany before I got here and I didn't mention any of this. I'm gonna go get her and bring her in for questioning about all this. - Great, thanks, Bobby. (soft suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) (engine starting) - See you soon. - You guys need some money? - (laughs) No, I can afford the groceries, Mom. - We'll get dinner started while you're gone. - Hurry back. - Okay, see you in a bit. - Let's go kid. - Let's go. (crickets chirping) (engine starting) So she's been secretly living among us for a year? - (sighs) I can't believe it. (soft suspenseful music) I need a drink, you want some wine? - Yes, please. - Are you more of a red girl or a white girl? - Do you have any sparkling? - I might. Let me see what I have in here. I usually keep something. Found a pinot (gasps). - Hi, Barbara. (intense dramatic music) - What do you want from us? - I want everyone to pay for what they did to me. - You murdered my husband, your own father! - You lured him away from me! From my family! - That is not the way that is happened, Marie, and you know it! - He had it coming to him. - Your mother was a drug addict and she fell in love with another man. - Stop lying! There, that'll shut you up. (door opens) - Were you really there? - Yes, I told you that. Do you remember, I told you about that. - (laughs) You crack me up, Ethan, how could I forget? Mom? - Lisa! - Oh my god. - I'll call the police. - Stop! Get over there. Well hi, sis. - I'm not your sister. - You killed Nina? - I liked Nina. But she was too smart for her own good. - Right. She found out who killed my father. - Our father! Let's not forget about me. - So it was you who killed him. (tires screeching) - [Bethany] Walking the same route home every night to his new family. He deserved it. - He did not deserve it. He tried to help your loser mother. - That never happened. He didn't do anything for us. - He paid and paid but your mother was nothing but a taker! - Shut up! - How did you find out Nina solved the crime? - I'm IT, Ethan. You've been such a asset. - Please untie them. Let them go. You're not in your right mind, you're not stable. - I spent 15 years in prison. You wonder why I'm not stable. - Sorry, I'm truly sorry. - You got all the breaks. Look at all this. - You're right. I have a wonderful mother. And I had a loving and supportive father. That is, until you killed him. Nothing that happened to you gives you the right to do that. Nothing! - Little sister's learning. Life isn't fair, and sometimes, the people you love die. - So what's the plan, Bethany? There's no way out of this. We already reported you to the police, they're gonna find out that you killed Nina. - They have nothing. I wiped Nina's hard drive. They have no evidence against me, but there is a lot of evidence against you. - Okay, so you kill everyone here and then what? - I'm not killing anyone. You are. - Really? - When they find you alive and more people around you dead, and your fingerprints on the murder weapon. Again? If Nina's murder wasn't enough to put you on Death Row, a triple murder will. (laughs) - You're a sick and delusional person. (doorbell rings) - Who is that? - It's probably the detective. She said she would stop by. - Go in there. Get rid of whoever that is. Otherwise I shoot Ethan, and then head over for your mom and BFF. (knocking on door) - Hold on. I'll be right there. (slow dramatic music) - [Liz] Lisa. - Hi, Detective. Just interrogating Michael Patterson and I wanted to drop by and ask you a few questions. - Oh. Now really isn't a good time, could you come by later? (phone chimes) - I'm sorry, I just need to check on that. - What is it? - Well, funny thing. I just got a notice that a 911 call was placed from this location. Is everyone here okay? - Yeah, I'm all right. - It says the call was made by Abby. Is she here, too? - Abby is, um, in the bathroom. - And she's okay? No emergency or anything? - No, she was okay when she went in. - I'm gonna need to have a conversation with Abby. Once the call is made I'm obligated. So, do you mind if I come in and wait for her to get out of the bathroom? - Oh, um. Yeah, oh, okay, that's okay. - So where's the bathroom Abby's in? - Um, the bathroom's right there. (slow suspenseful music) (knocking on door) - Abby, you in there? Are you okay? - Okay, back up. - Okay, I'm backing. Stay calm. - [Bethany] I am calm. - Can I suggest a few options on how you can handle this? - You don't have an option that doesn't involve sending me back to prison, right? - You've committed murder, Bethany. - Yeah, I'm not going back! Now I want everyone to get on their knees. Take your hand off the gun! - I can't do that. It might be the only thing that keeps you from murdering innocent people. - Just please stop this now. - You think I'm afraid to pull the trigger? I've done it before. - Doesn't have to end this way, Bethany. - Take your hand off the gun! - I cannot let you kill all these people. (gun fires) (Liz groans) - Freeze, put your weapon down! - Bobby. Always the hero. But one thing, you go first. - No, no! (Liz groans) (guns firing) (Bethany groans) - [Ethan] You okay? - [Bobby] Are you all right? Let's put some pressure on it. - [Liz] Yeah, sure. - Oh god. Thank you. Are you all right? - I am. - You were able to call the police? - It worked? - [Ethan] You saved us all. - Everybody all right? Bethany's dead, it's finished. (Lisa sighs) - Can you get my hands? - Yeah, let me get this. - Oh, thank god. - I cannot believe that in five short years, we are where we are today. I love all of you so much. Thank you for being a part of this company. Here's to the expansion and the growth of our company. To you guys. Cheers everybody, seriously. I couldn't have done it without you two. - Hey, Michael. - Thanks, Ethan. - What are you doing here? - Hey, Barbara. I just came to bring Lisa a file. - Oh. Sounds so official. (Michael laughs) You don't wanna stay for the fun? - No, I should probably get out of here after... - Why? - Hey. Is my mom taking up all your time. - Uh, yes I am, absolutely. It is crazy. Handsome guys just come and talk to me wherever I go. Think I still got it. - Okay. Mom, you can go now. - Oh, that's settled. I'm going. - Bye, Barbara. - Nice to see you. - You, too. Uh, hey, listen. I brought your father's file from Nina's computer. There's a lot of information on it, so I put it on a thumb drive. - Thanks. So does this mean you're done helping Ethan with the computers? - Uh, you know, he wanted me to stay and consult for you guys, but, uh, well, I told him I'd think about it. I didn't wanna be intrusive. After all, it got kinda weird between us. - I've been meaning to talk to you about everything that happened. - Yeah, it's pretty crazy, right? - (laughs) Yes. Crazy is right. I'm so sorry. - No, you shouldn't be. I mean, you didn't know what was gonna happen. - But I got you arrested. - (laughs) Yeah, that was a new experience for me. You know, but don't forget, I did knock out your boyfriend on our first date. - Ex-boyfriend. - Right. (Lisa laughs) So you're okay? - Yeah, I will be. Eventually. - I should, I should go. - Wait, go? (laughs) What do you have an appointment or something? - No, I just thought that with everything that happened between us that uh, well... - Wait a second, Mr. Wonderful. (laughs) What if I want you to stay? - You know, I'm never gonna be able to live that one down, am I? - (laughs) Not with me around. - And, as they say in sales, but wait, there is more. Not only is our consultant Barbara Clark helping to design our new office, Abby Bingham is now officially promoted to manager. - Woo! - That's my girl. Ethan, I can't thank you enough for bringing me into all of this. It is exactly what I needed. - It's my pleasure, Barbara. - I think having a new direction has been good for all of us. - A toast. To new directions. - To looking forward, and never forgetting the past. Here's to Nina. - To Nina. - To Nina. And to Dad. We'll remember you forever, but just know that we found some peace. - I love you, baby. (laughs) - Love you, Mom. - Cheers, everyone. - [Group] Cheers. (group laughing) - [Ethan] Congrats. Cheers, guys, cheers. (glasses clinking) (soft upbeat music)
