That's it! Tremblay advances to the quarter final. Next up, the Bobtails! They're smoking! Smoking! Up next, Serge Jr. in Lil' Rex reaching the starting line. His adversary... That's us! Eric “Pooch" Fraser. They're in position. Thinks he's so hot! You're gonna lose! Loser! Your engine's gonna explode! Come on! We're gonna crush you! They're ready to roll! And Fraser takes it! Another loss for Serge Jr. It was so close! So close! Come on, tiger. It's just a race. We'll win next year, you'll see. Look at me. Who's the strongest? That's my girl! STAMPEDE I was gunning for him. Christ, he beat me by this much. You OK, buddy? Yeah. Are we going? We'll sleep here. Dad's too sloshed to drive you back. Can I take the top bed? Why not! C'mon. Sweet dreams, tiger. Don't go, Dad! I'll be right outside. If you need anything. Go on. CRAZY BITCH Dad! Wake up, Mom's here! Serge! Shit. Serge! Serge Jr.! Get out of your truck! Come here. You fucking liar! You said she'd sleep at home. Calm down. You and your shitty promises... Come on, Jess! Move it, Lily! - You like getting in trouble, huh? - What? Some champ! Her mom's right. Lily deserves better than you. What the fuck? Serge! Stop, goddammit! Christ! Dad! Dad, stop! - You OK? – Go away! That's enough! Retard! Asshole. Lily! Move it! I’ll remember this! And we're off! Go! Go! Go! - You owe me 10 bucks! - That was Sam's bet. I bet on the goldfish! How about a toast for the fish? - Rest in peace! – The best die young! You boasted you'd win but you lost again. You starve them while you're on the road? They must be happy to see you come home. How long's it been since you saw Lily? What's your ex's problem? Moving up north with her stud? I'm trying to change my runs. She’ll see red when I turn up! Baie-Comeau is just an 8-hour drive. 7 hours non-stop with a light load. Christ, Jr.! Guys... - I brought a treat! - What is it, you douche? You freak! Your piranhas won't be hungry for a while after this snack. Go on, let'em have it! Hey, boys! Are you hungry? That bastard'll never change! You've reached Jessica, leave a message. Jess, I don't know what more I can do to apologize. Tell Lily to call. She must miss me. Should I charter a plane with a Sorry Jess banner? Pick Lily up in a horse carriage dressed as a clown? Just say the word. It's my weekend coming up. I'll come get her. SOLD Hello? Girls? Anybody home? I have a surprise for Lily! Lily? Jess? Come on, it's my weekend! Let's return to position for our leg extensions. Peanut, you're getting so good! - Why are you here? – I have a surprise. You'll love it. Does Mom know? Of course she knows! A surprise like this takes preparation! Come on, let's go! Is this the surprise? Go fetch the Badlands jar from the truck. Go on! Guess what we'll do with all this? Do you still want to go to the Badlands Rodeo? You sure Mom's OK with it? I apologized. We had a long talk, without lawyers or anything. She agreed to let us have a little vacation. It's a surprise, so I made her promise not to tell. She swore it, spat, and zipped it! I see she kept her promise. That's not all! We have a new turbo. I thought you couldn't afford it. We can't go to the world's greatest truck rodeo and risk losing a race! So who'll be the new champs of the whole world and the universe? Watch out! Badlands, Alberta, Canada! World's Best Truck Rodeo! Hey, Lil Rex! Welcome to Ontario! Lily, wake up. Let's play a game. OK, like we said, no more talking. Stay right there, I won't be long. You can come out now. Lily? Are we there? Come to bed, tiger. Go back to sleep, OK? OK. MISSED CALLS CRAZY BITCH Good morning! You're gonna love this! Check it out! Chocolate milk! And... Seriously? Drumsticks! Ready? Yeah! I have to pee! Dad! I need the bathroom! Dad, I need to pee! Are you deaf or what? Sorry, I had a wrestler in my ear! You're a big girl, hold it in. Buckle up. It won't come out! Think of a running faucet. It's not working! It's an adventure, like peeing standing up. Only boys pee like that! Not at all! It's a known fact women sensei can do it too! Tetsuki says that's not true! Tell smart-ass to butt out! I thought you'd outgrown him. We only talk by telepathy now. He left to run a marathon around the world. Move it, Lily! - What's the rush? – Rodeo's in three days. Three days to drive across Canada! Now get in the truck, co-pilot! Can I Waze the route on your phone and do the robot voice? Technical snag, we have to do it old school. So... we're here. And we're going all the way here. Canada's fuckin' huge! - Alberta's in Canada? – Yeah. - I thought you hated Canada. – True. See what I'm willing to do for you? All that only takes three days? If my co-pilot's Lil Rex Gauthier, we'll make it easy. Why can't we use the GPS on your phone? Stupid me, I left my phone at home. No way! What if Mom wants to call us? She'll send messages by carrier pigeon. There are pay phones everywhere, we can call whenever you want. And we're off. Where are we now? Thunder Bay. - Where's that? - It's where lightning strikes. What's that? Dad! - You'll pick up all the cheeseballs, right? – No, you will! - I'll pick them up? – Yup. Take that! Ready? Here goes! My god, I got it! - One, two... – No! - Three! – Ding! Ding! Ding! You beat me. Shrimp face! Mammoth mug! You rotting old anaconda! Jesus! Goddamn bozo! Bozo! And you, tiger? Everything! We'll take one everything. Dad! Dad! Don't pay'em any attention. We'll eat here. Lily? What're you doing? Grab the food and get in the truck. Christ! What got into you? I don't always set a good example. When I keyed Uncle Pat's car on your mom's birthday, I was mad, but it was wrong. We don’t act like that. I'm talking to you! You don't do that! Are you listening? I came down too hard. I just wanted us to talk. I want to call Mom. Either help me or get out so I can clean your mess. What the hell? Fucking psycho! I'm sorry I keyed his car. Don't apologize, it's not your fault. Think they'll come back? Those goons? No, they won't be back. I'll always be there to protect you. Swear, spit, and zip it? I swear it... Just in case. Can I have a teeny sip? One sip and you'd be bouncing off the ceiling. I have a quick errand. I thought we were in a rush. Call me flash. Look what I got you! I want to call Mom. OK, come on. No answer. This is Serge Jr., leave a message. Hi, Jess, it's me. I'm with Lily, things are fine. We had a long day, she OD'd on junk food. Anyway, we're making good time. Lily's eager to tell you all about it. Hi, Mom! Can't wait to talk to you for real. We had quite a big day. I started by eating cheeseballs. Then I had chocolate milk and a chocolate bar. We played drums with pepperettes. It was pretty fun. But I scratched a car. Dad got pretty beat up because of it. Love you, bye. I think it's time you changed your clothes. I want my kimono. Tetsuki says it's my strength. OK, you're the boss. Wait in the truck while I pay for the fuel. We'll find a spot to sleep. Isn't that why the trucks park here? Yeah. But we'll find a nicer spot. - Lock the doors till I'm back! – OK. AMBER ALERT HELP US SAVE A CHILD Unlock it! You OK, peanut? Did you see a ghost? Did you ever kill someone? What? Course not. Why? Why are we hiding here? We're not hiding. Is it because of that car? Is the police looking for us? Why won't you answer? Of course not! Wanna play “Talk with your mouth full?” Pete and Repeat were at sea. Pete fell in, who's left on the boat? You're not enjoying our trip? Tetsuki says a sensei wouldn't go on such a messed up trip. He wants us to talk to Mom, not some voicemail. Does it hurt? Not really. Would you like to live with Daddy? Like... all the time. I'd miss Mom too much. There. Your trip fucking sucks! Come on, wake up! I want to call Mom. You promised. There's no pay phone here. Dad, you said we'd call Mom. Dad! I want to call Mom! Dad! Not now, Lily! You found Daddy's phone! I was sure I forgot it at home. Your phone doesn't work! I want to call Mom! I want to get out! I wanna get out! You're not talking to your mom, fuck! Now sit down and do as I say! Come back! Are you nuts? You could've died! Lily! Why do you always lie? You ruin everything! Why did you leave? You left us! Don't say that, it's not true. Your mom asked me to. She had her reasons. Liar! I hate you! I want to go home. We can't do that, Lily. We've come too far. Are you still there, Dad? Of course. - Did you wash your hair? – Yeah. Yuck! What shall we eat, tiger? We could get some hot chicken. But I bet Saskatchewan gravy tastes like rabbit farts. What's the date today? August 12th, peanut. Lily? Come on, dammit! I speak le French. I speak le French too. Are you lost? - Where are your parents? – I don't have any. I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, tiger! I'm such a goddamn idiot! How could I put you through all this? No more lies, OK? Never again. How's she doing? May I? Your daughter really let it all out. I can't thank you enough, ma'am. Drop the “ma'am” and we're good. - Do you have a truck too? – A sweet Peterbilt. The rig's name is Burgundy Devil. Yeah, I saw it. Been driving long? 22 years. You? Nine. Same age as my girl. I've wanted to take her on the road for so long. Take out the straw. Take your glass and swirl it around three times counter-clockwise. I can see your future in your milkshake bubbles. It's no joke. Same as reading tea leaves. I see a cross. Imminent danger. What is it? I see good stuff too. See this? It shows that when you get to the other side, there's hope. The good news is you're coming to a door, the door of judgment. That's supposed to be good news? It's a rebirth. Before or after being judged? Does it say? Which bubble says so? All I know is the process has already begun. It's a renaissance, man. I'll probably lose custody because of this trip. Your daughter... Dad, didn't we drive past here yesterday? Yeah. What? You're heading back? Exactly, tiger. This trip was a dumb idea. You have no right! We didn't come all this way for nothing! Stop the truck! Stop, or I'll scream so loud our eardrums will burst and spurt blood everywhere! We're not damn quitters who turn back. No, we're not. I wanted you all to myself. Like an idiot. Can we still race in the Badlands? Even if it's not the rodeo? Deal! Then we hurry home. Who's the strongest?
