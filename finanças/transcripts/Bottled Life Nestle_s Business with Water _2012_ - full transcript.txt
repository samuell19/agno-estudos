The boost to our EBIT margin from 9.8 percent to 14 percent of sales. We eliminated more than 10 percent of all stock-keeping units. Nine billion Swiss Francs, or almost nine billion dollars. From 6.2 billion Swiss Francs to 15 billion Swiss Francs, an average gross of 10 percent per year. Food and beverage amounts and surpassed, also, the 100th billion order. Our internal volume gross amounts to 3.7 percent on average. With three percent, this has reached a level amongst the highest attained in my 12 years as chief executive. Lake Geneva. It's into this lake that melt water flows from the mountains of Switzerland. Located on the shoreline is the headquarters of a company which deals in water. It's the headquarters of Nestlé, the most powerful food and beverage company in the world. Without water there is no sustainability for our company and for our shareholders. This has to be our chief priority. The continued availability of water is key to our continued ability to grow and to serve the consumers' needs all over the world. At Nestlé, we believe that to have a long-term business success, you must simultaneously create value for the shareholders and for the public. And we call this creating shared value and it is a fundamental principle behind the way we conduct business at Nestlé. Our corporate social responsibility report is as thick as our financial report, so I think it's a good balance again, which is reflected. When it comes to water, Peter Brabeck is a global ambassador. He travels the world, preaching cautious and careful use of this most precious commodity. He's a captain of big business, committed to making money, but also a man who speaks of social responsibility, so I want to know more about that. My first destination is the east of Ethiopia, where Nestlé is helping the United Nations to provide a U.N. refugee camp with drinking water. It's one of their humanitarian projects, which the company finances as part of its corporate social responsibility program. It's the lack of drinking water, the global water problem, which is also of paramount priority for the U.N. The water crisis is perhaps the most urgent ecological and human threat of our time and more children die every year in our world of water than HIV/AIDS, traffic accidents, and war combined. In their recent World Water Development Report, twenty-four agencies of the United Nations confirmed that the global water crisis is getting worse and threatening millions of people every day. We can benefit the people of Ethiopia in a way that is impossible for either the United Nations or Nestlé to do it by itself. Clean drinking water is a life or death issue. By combining the know-how of our Nestlé water company geologists with the field expertise of UNHCR, be able to ensure access to pure water for tens of thousands of people. This is true, not only for today, but for many years to come. This is the camp to which Peter Brabeck is referring in his Nestlé video. It's home to some 20,000 refugees from neighboring war-torn Somalia. Many of them have been here for more than 20 years, waiting for the killing in their country to stop. (crying) In 2004 the situation got better. Due to the pipeline. (crying) But I get only two to three jerrycans a day. That has to satisfy ten people for drinking, cooking, and washing. Sometimes we are two to three days without water. Due to borehole problems, may be lack of electricity. Then we have to wait for the specialist to repair the system. It's exhausting. We have to share with the neighbours and economize even more. I've been expecting something of a showcase project, but instead, refugees tell me there's a shortage of water. The camp is supplied by an underground water pipeline, the water being pumped from the valley, some 20 kilometers away. Nestlé co-financed the water supply system, and according to Peter Brabeck, is committed to its long-term operation. The groundwater is high in ion content and requires special treatment. This is the water pipe which leads up to the Kebribeyah refugee camp. Because of the strong corrosion, the water pumps down in the valley are often out of operation, and when that happens, 20,000 people at the other end of the pipe are left without water. This is the station where we keep three service pumps, to pump water from here to the booster station. We are... in the last three or four years, we have a lot of work to maintain this because after time, the pumps get older and they have to be replaced, and this system is now running, partially as a result of the funding we got from (unintelligible). This means that Nestlé is no longer supporting this system? No, not now, these new pumps are changed in 2007 and then 2008. Until 2004, they supported and since then they are not anymore following up this project. (machine running) We have to continue to ensure the provision of water to our people and we have refugees in Kebribeyah. We have refugees in Aw Barre and in Shedder. About 75,000 refugees alone are depending on the provision of UNHCR... UNHCR support, so we really need supporters, organizations, donors. Nestlé's commitment to the camp is finished, but according to the company website, it's still continuing. ...are closer to reality than ever before. Our aim is to make sure that the water system can keep functioning over the long-term, so that the people of the region and their children will have access to clean water for many years into the future. Nestlé has not been here since 2005... end of 2005. Is Brabeck intentionally playing up Nestlé's commitment? Or is the companies PR perhaps getting just a little too enthusiastic? The water companies are in this for one reason and that is profit and sometimes they connect up to a project like this for their marketing tools because we, all over the world, are criticizing them and they are trying to renew their image in the world. They don't stick with something unless it's profitable. They are a big, transnational, competitive corporation. They will never stay with something for humanitarian reasons. They don't get into it for humanitarian reasons and they won't stay with it for humanitarian reasons. $2,920... Maude Barlow, from Canada, is an ambassador for water, just like Peter Brabeck. ...and it's gonna have rivers that run so fast... Except that she's a consumer activist, a winner of the Alternative Nobel Prize, and a strong critic of Nestlé. ...to love mother nature. Nestlé and water, we've asked the company for an interview and we're still waiting for a reply. For the time being, we can film only these pictures, on the fringes of a media event. Nestlé is one of the most profitable companies ever. Annual turnover exceeds $100 billion. It's the world's largest food and beverage multinational, adored by investors big and small. More than a quarter of a million staff, and the chairman of the board is a man with a mission. I have often wondered what is the most important single factor that could ensure a company continuing for another 140 years. And I have come to the same conclusion - water. Water has been important for Nestlé ever since Henri Nestlé founded the company nearly 150 years ago. He was producing mineral water as early as the 19th Century. He lived high above Lake Geneva, privately acquiring local water rights, so that he could provide his home and garden with fresh water. To the village, he donated this fountain, with its excess of residual water from his home. When it comes to bottled water, Nestlé is the undisputed world leader. The company has bought up many of its competitors and now owns more than 70 different brands. Annual turnover totals more than $9 billion. With the takeover of Perrier in 1992, brands such as Poland Spring joined the product portfolio, ensuring access to the lucrative beverage market of the U.S.A. We also look, of course, which is also very important, which is, "What is the image of our company?" So we are checking all over the world, constantly, what are people thinking about Nestlé's compliance, about Nestlé's responsibility as a corporate citizen? In Bern, Switzerland, I have an appointment with a senior Nestlé manager. He chose the restaurant. Will Nestlé give us information about its water business? And an interview with Peter Brabeck? The answer is "no." According to the Nestlé man, it would be the wrong film at the wrong time. Then he offers to commission from us a film about the global use of water in every culture. Above and beyond that, the doors of Nestlé will be closed to us, worldwide. That means no cooperation from Nestlé. From now on, we can film Peter Brabeck only when he makes public appearances, but that doesn't deter us, so we travel to the country where the company sells most of its water. A spring water pumping station in the northeast of the U.S.A. For its Poland Spring brand, Nestlé pumps out a million liters of water here every day. A tanker can hold 30,000 liters of water, for which Nestlé pays a private landowner just $10. In Fryeburg, the heavy traffic poses a problem. The water tankers carry out 25,000 trips a year. They travel to Nestlé's bottling plant, located about an hour from the village. An aquifer in Fryeburg, that supplies about a sixth of the water for Poland Spring bottling, was the focus of attention today. Some of the town's residents say Poland Spring is polluting a local pond and ruining their quality of life. So today, dozens of people made a splash to highlight their concern. News Center's Kristen Cullen has the story. (commotion) Howard Dearborn wants Poland Spring out of Fryeburg. If you're taking millions of gallons of water out of one place, there has to be an effect somewhere. That's why he's invited Fryeburg residents to dump bottles of Poland Spring water into the pond outside his home, back where it came from, but Mark Dubois, with Poland Spring, says these claims are false and denies that the company's business in Fryeburg is polluting the pond. No one's been able to suggest any fact that there's a relationship between our withdrawals and the suggestions that Mr. Dearborn's making. They don't belong here, they don't have a right to be here, and even if law allows, they don't have a right to come here and take the water. I think it is a soap opera in that it has many aspects of good fiction. It has families, it has money, it has politics, it has a lot of intrigue, a lot of secret meetings, a lot of public misconception and misperception and misinformation and a lot of court action and um, small-town political in-fighting and disagreement. (traffic) In Fryeburg, Nestlé wants to build a second pumping station. It wants to pump double the quantity of water, but after some consideration, the local authorities are refusing the company permission. As a result, Nestlé is now suing the town. This truck access, from Denmark and that water source, is something that is crucial to their growth here. It's crucial to the supply of water to their other plants, I assume. It raises the question even more loudly, "Who does the water belong to?" And if I have a house next to your house and I pump out of my land, where is the line where what I pump out from under my land, is coming out from under yours? The situation right now is that the public has said "no." The planning board said "no," the appeals board has said "no," and Nestlé is suing. The appeal was finaled, I believe, last week or the week before. Suing the inhabitants of the town of Fryeburg. In my opinion that is an absolute right when somebody says they do not want a bottling operation in their community. That is something we must also understand. Nestlé constantly needs new sources of water. Here in the state of Maine, a whole team of hydrogeologists is searching for new springs for the company. Nestlé either acquires water rights privately or purchases whole areas outright, which is what happened in the Fryeburg region. In the state of Maine, you can take as much water as you want. It was a law that was put into place for people who were running farms and needed to have water in order to sustain themselves in order to make a piece of land work. The playing field that they operate on is one of laws that exist and litigation, lawsuits, and regulations, so they are very, very astute in dealing with um, changing regulations or working within regulations to meet the demands and goals that they have, so Howard is trying to do whatever he can, I'm helping him out to try to raise awareness to this issue, and the bigger issue is, "Whose water is it?" Poland Springs or Nestlés would like to sew up the entire area up here, and get all this mountain water, and sell it all over the world for money, regardless of what it does to the ecology. Of course. Money rules. If there was no resistance to them coming to town, there would be no office with a good-neighbor policy and giving away free coffee. The funny part is they give away free water. They were giving away a case of free water to the first 50 people every month that come in there, and for me it's extremely ludicrous because that water is the water that we get when we turn our sink on. They put it in a plastic bottle, after they pump it into a truck, they bring it and put labels on it, bring it back to Fryeburg and give it away as a free gift to the people who can turn their sink on. For me it's a travesty, it's a joke. They use it up there to wash their hands in it and flush their toilets with the same water that Nestlés is selling as spring water. Think about that. In Maine, opposition is growing. Many people are angry that Nestlé is making big money out of their water. I meet up again with Maude Barlow. Nestlé is a water hunter, they're a predator. They're not interested in the sustainable use of groundwater or the springs that... or the rivers and the springs that they use. They're out for one thing and that is to make money, and so they come into an area and they see the water like water mining, like a gold company. They come in, they drain an aquifer till it's gone and when it's gone they move on. They don't live there, very seldom. They don't have any connection to the place. They're after profit. They're predators, water hunters, looking for the last pure water in the world. (quacking) In the small town of Poland, stands a kind of fairy tale castle. It's a bottling plant dating from the year 1907. The original spring now has little water. Rumor has it the spring ran dry a long time ago. But the name has remained. Today, Poland Spring is the top-selling spring water in the U.S.A. For Nestlé, a sparkling success in terms of turnover. Today in the state of Maine, there are three new plants bottling Poland Spring water. The newest is this one, built by Nestlé in Kingfield, one hundred and twenty kilometers from the original spring. (truck engine) We want to pay a visit. The local media spokesperson said that all she had to do was inform head office. (dialing) Hello? Hello, my name is Res from DokLab. We want to visit the factory. Do you have an appointment or are you here to see somebody in particular? Yeah uh, Elizabeth Swain told us to come to Kingfield. - Elizabeth Swain? - Yeah. Could you wait a minute, please? The barrier stays down, just like the Nestlé man told us back in the Swiss restaurant. (rain and thunder) In Kingfield, the water is clean and pure, and there's plenty of it. The village is located off the beaten track and is sparsely populated north of Maine. The town's regulatory ordinance allows Nestlé to pump 750 million liters of water every year. This village has welcomed the new factory. Kingfield has a population of 1,000. Many hope that Nestlé's presence will mean an economic upswing for the village. I think it's been very positive. Our community has lost a lot of jobs over the years and Poland Spring has come to town. Right now they're probably, you know employing 40, 50, 60 people, I'm not sure the exact numbers. I think it's gonna expand, and, um, they've been a good neighbor. Um, they pay taxes, they support the schools, they support the... excuse me... The fire department, the recreation programs. Um, it's a very positive experience, you know, that we've had with Poland Spring. The First Selectman, John Dill, supported the Nestlé project right from the start. N the town hall, local clubs, and societies requiring financial support, can fill in these Poland Spring donation request forms. I love having them in town. They've been good neighbors, they've given us some economic stability, they've paid a fair amount of taxes, they've helped other area towns, they've helped all the schools, all five schools in our school district, they contribute to, um, local and civic organizations. We got an old 25 year-old playground that was unsafe for the kids and they were a large contributor to that. So we now have a modern playground for the local kids to play with. How much does Poland Spring pay for the water? The water's free because the people who own the land... State law says, "You own the land, you own what's underneath the land," so the town didn't own the land so we couldn't... We couldn't lease the water. All we can do is levy property taxes. They are part of the town. They've done everything we've asked them to do and more. They have always been good neighbors. My next destination is a wildlife preserve, some 200 kilometers south of Kingfield. (truck passing) Here, too, the hydrogeologists have been successful in their search, but a small group of women are against Nestlé. (running water) Look over there, there's water coming this side of... And kind of a thins out, that was the start of the field and it would go down to the brook. The reason I'm fighting for water preservation is we have a very large water aquifer here that we care very much about what happens to it. Nestlé moved their way into it over three years ago without us knowing about it. We noticed wells were in place on this land and that's why we began the fight to maintain control of this. Motto for Maine is the way life should be and life should not include corporate trucks going back and forth, it is nature at its best, that's what Maine is known for and I'd like to see that we keep it that way. My passion is um, we're in the battle of our life with Nestlé and we're trying to not have Nestlé come into our town. I find that water is a necessity, it is not a commodity, so I've joined with, um, some friends and neighbors in the town here and we were actually, uh, trying to stop, uh, Nestlé from coming in and extracting water from this area in a large scale. Watch the tree. Yeah. The State Department of Inland Fisheries and Game had allowed them to put monitoring test wells in. There are approximately 18 of them in the ground. I have learned through the representative, he told them, "Just go up North and buy a lake, they don't want you here." But they said they want this because, um, it is so pure and it won't cost them much. So, Nestlé decided to put wells in the ground, they go down a certain number of feet and they let them monitor the water levels in this area of the land preserve. They have not requested a permit to extract, they're only testing our area. Well, here we are! We're still, this is three years we've been tested. In order to exploit commercially the massive reserves of water, Nestlé is trying to find private land at the towns of Shapleigh and Newfield. From there, it wants to pump water from the wildlife preserve and at the lowest possible price. In the towns around the preserve, Nestlé has now become a political issue. (car horns honking) Wooo! (car horns honking) As for Fryeburg, we cannot fight that company on any level playing field. They didn't feel it was necessary to hold a public hearing on this issue. This is why local control is so important. Government exists to serve the people. The people do not exist to serve the government. We are not serfs. No. - Yay! - Yeah! Your elected officials are there to carry out your wishes. Corporate America has the large lobby firms. They are there, they are drowning us out. It is time for people to stand back up and speak to what they need to address, what is right for their towns. You live in the towns, they don't. They live overseas. It is a question of whether the normal water supply for the population should be privatized or not. And there are two points of view. One, I would call it an extreme point of view, is that supported by NGOs which insist on water being declared a public right. In other words, as a person, you simply should have a right to have water. That's an extreme solution. The other view is that water is a foodstuff and just like any foodstuff, it should have market value. They want our water and they want our water for profit and what they're paying, less than a penny a gallon, is just outrageous and what happens is they come... They come in again to these small rural areas where there's very limited government and they use their scare tactics and they're a billion dollar company and you can never beat them. Nestlé has the power to come in and alter a road then that says that something is not correct with our state government. I went to a meeting in Hollis, uh, just to see how they go about to try to change the town regulations and after the meeting, I was approached by their lead attorney, Mr. Ahearn, as if what would I want to turn around and to support Nestlé, and what how... What could he do for me here and I... and I mentioned stuff about Route 11, how it was gonna be their major truck route, and he says, "We'll get the bridges fixed. Whatever you people need, we will do." And I said, "You can't do anything. I wanna save the river that I live on, my game preserve, that is not up for sale." So, we went into this thinking, "Okay, yes, if we can work with them on the regulatory ordinance that they're going to be using, and we only wanted a few things. If they had thrown us a bone and given us a couple, we probably would have said, "Hey, yeah, we did a great job and we kept 'em, you know, to only so many trucks a day, or so many hours of, uh, use, or we, you know, did this and that." But they wouldn't give an inch. Nestlé might be a wonderful company, but I have not seen it. We've tried to work with Nestlé, but when you find out that Nestlé weaves their way into our community and the person that wrote our regulatory ordinance was recommended by Nestlé. Well, the people should be writing the regulatory ordinance, it's our town, we're the taxpayers. So, what we did was we met with the elected officials and, um, under the regulatory approach in the United States, the regulatory approach, we have ordinances in each town and what those ordinances do, the regulatory ordinance, pretty much tells companies or a small company or a large company, what they can do and their limits and so forth. But it only regulates them, it... we cannot say, "No, we don't want you in." Then I found out this thing called "future lost profits" so I found that, what's going on in Fryeburg is they were trying to control water extraction with a regulatory ordinance and it doesn't work, because now you're limiting how much profit a company can make and they are allowed to make profits. So, pretty much, we tried to work the regulatory approach with the elected officials. The elected officials, every single time we met with them, and there were probably 40 or 50 of us, that met with them, just would not listen to any of our demands and finally we were like, "This is gonna go through just like these test wells have, so what do we do next?" Of course, we know them very well and we have intensive discussions with them. The situation varies from country to country, from city to city, or, as in the USA, from state to state. In several countries, there are people who are very happy. In others, there's discussion about whether or not we're interfering with the natural water-flow. Will the fleet of green tankers soon be transporting water from this wildlife preserve? Nestlé's battle with the determined women of Shapleigh and Newfield has not yet been decided. Hello. Uh, we're from DokLab, this is a Swiss production company. Can you give me your opinion about some people are opposed to the trucking of water and... I have... I have no comment. You have no comment on that? No, I do not. Okay, but for you, it's good to have a job with Poland Spring as I imagine? Oh, I think so. You're not allowed to speak to us? No, I'm not. Not even on that? Nope, nah, man. What about you, sir? When we drill a well, here's one thing you shouldn't forget, it's in our inherent interest that the well can be sustained long term. Nothing could be worse for us than building up a brand and then discovering there's no water to fill it up. We are interested in sustainable source areas and not in short-term operations. I've followed the big water tankers to Hollis, Maine, to the largest water bottling factory in the world. Half the water is pumped by Nestlé from the area directly behind the factory. The other half is transported in tankers from pumping stations in the hinterland. For one tanker load, Nestlé pays $10 or even nothing. Once bottled, the same water costs $50,000 when sold across the counter as Poland Spring Natural Spring Water. In Maine, Nestlé pumps about as much water as that used by the entire agricultural sector throughout the state. That's around three billion liters a year and the figure is rising. Back in Switzerland, we're at Nestlé's annual press conference. For us, the opportunity to film inside the company. I'm interested in Nestlé's new brand of water, aimed at winning over consumers in developing countries. At the press conference, we are offered San Pellegrino and Vittel Water. The new product carries the promising name: "Pure Life." Pure Life brand, for those who don't know, ten years ago did not exist and it's an incredible, uh, story to go from zero to where we are today, one of the top brands that Nestlé has and one of the reasons we've been able to grow, is we've been able to offer the consumer a value, good quality water in different parts of the world and it's been very well accepted. We're looking to take that asset and expand it to more geography, more parts of the world, we think the growth will, in fact, continue. Uh, it's a profitable brand for us too and it's a jewel that we have in our portfolio and our plans are to continue to leverage it. So, I'm very optimistic about that brand. One water for the whole world. That's the idea behind Pure Life. Pure Life is purified ground water, enriched by an artificial blend of minerals. It's a secret Nestlé recipe. It's produced locally in 27 countries on five continents. It tastes the same everywhere. Nestlé Pure Life is now the top selling bottled water in the world, growing in double-digits. The test market for the product was Pakistan. The population of Pakistan totals 180 million and it's still growing. In Lahore alone, there are 10 million people. Clean drinking water is in short supply. Before Nestlé introduced Pure Life, bottled water was a rare sight in Pakistan. Now, Nestlé dominates a vast market that it created itself. I grew up in a city where you could go just about anywhere and ask for a glass of water and you would get a glass of water for free, without any fear of its quality or its standards and what's happened over the last 10 to 15 years, I mean, in my own consciousness, is that I have seen and witnessed a replacement of drinking water, a commodification of drinking water. Uh... I won't say that it's Nestlé that's done it, it's been a confluence of factors. Nestlé appeared on the scene, it started providing Pure Life drinking water and all of a sudden Coca-Cola shows up, then Pepsi shows up, and then a whole bunch of private, local manufactured waters shows up as well, all producing clean water, clean water, because of the terribly old and creaky infrastructure of the sanitation authority. And then before you know it, everywhere you go, if you ask for a glass of water, I have to pay 15 rupees for it. Our water table is falling. We don't have a replenished water table for a variety of reasons and as a result, we continue to sink wells lower and lower, deeper and deeper to get drinking water for Lahore and at some point in the future, this resource will run out and I'm also concerned about water, drinking water in Lahore because the infrastructure of sewage an sanitation and water pipes in Lahore is at least 30 years old and in many places through the city, these pipes break and drinking water, and perhaps sewage, mix and we have all sorts of cases of gastroenteritis and water poisoning in the city through the year. This water is not consumable, but it's the only one available. Once we drink this water, we get different diseases, stomach diseases. New water pipes should be placed in this area. Carbon is coming through the pipes. How do you see that the water is dirty? How do you recognize it? Straight away it is visible, big particles are present in the water. The water is too dirty. You have to boil it, filter it, and then drink it. If you drink it, you have to rush to the toilet because the water causes digestive troubles. There are long water worms inside. They are moving inside. We do not show this water to the children, otherwise, they will not drink it. They will be too much disturbed. Nestlé Pure Life is the safe alternative delivered direct to homes. A service for the well-to-do. We film at the home distribution station in the upmarket area of Gulberg. I introduced myself to the station manager and asked for permission to film. Uh, what-what is the problem? Sir... (speaking foreign language) But you said it's okay that we film from the outside? So... When Nestlé sent its first managing director to Pakistan, he wanted to know what would be the product that I would immediately launch and he wanted an answer without thinking and I immediately said, "Water." Becau... and then he asked me why and then I explained. I explained to him how many people travel from rural areas to urban areas every day for various tasks and, uh... in this heat, people want to have clean water more than juices or cold drinks because they do not quench the thirst like water does and there's nowhere you can find water. The University of Management Sciences in Lahore. In this elite institution, hardly anyone drinks tap water and Pure Life is a success story. I think that part of the success of Pure Life is Nestlé's marketing, their positioning of the brand was good, it was targeted towards upper income people because, assuming that you can always get water free, who would pay a premium for it? Uh, so most probably the poor people will not. Uh, in any case, they can't afford the prices, uh, so it is, uh, you know, the upper class of Pakistan or upper middle class. And Nestlé brought skill and the skill was because of their marketing muscle, their distribution muscle, you know, their ads were very interesting. A lot of emphasis on the quality of water and water that you can trust. For a lot of youth, uh, it was fashionable to be walking around with Pure Life in hand. Uh, you know, it was making a statement about themselves also, so it was not just functional benefits, it was position on that, um, that if you are... you know, a modern person, if you are a, um, you know... person who's health conscious. They are, in some sense, the jet setters of Pakistan. I think Nestlé and bottled water companies have been able to effectively appeal to a part of the Pakistani psyche that likes things like this. They've appealed to a lifestyle. I read somewhere recently that a lot of the Cola manufacturers decided to go into making bottled water because they knew that the market for Cola was limited, because it's so clearly unhealthy for you. But the market for drinking water is unlimited, it's-it's a constant supply. So, it's just a question of being able to effectively commodify drinking water and, I mean, I've seen it happen before my eyes in the last 20 years and it's not necessarily with... Not necessarily within the realm of pure conspiracy theory, I'm sure at some level this is part of a business plan put forward by a company. That, look, here's a market that, where there's nobody drinking bottled water. If we go in and do this, this, this, all of a sudden, we have 10 million consumers. How's that? It's brilliant. About 40 kilometers from Lahore, there's Nestlé's Sheikhupura factory. When the company introduced Pure Life to Pakistan some 10 years ago, it was launched from here. The water that was tested there turned out to be the best quality that we had tested. So, it was the best quality water we were getting, so, obviously we chose that. Right next to the factory, the dwellings of Bhati Dilwan village. Most of the village population work in agriculture. The arrival of Nestlé brought extra employment, but the factory is also blamed for the biggest problem in the village. There's a lack of clean drinking water. In our opinion, Nestlé has taken our water from us. Nestlé put its own tube well in the factory. Now, the water has become very dirty. The water level used to be at 1,000 feet, now the level is down to 300 to 400 feet. We worry a lot. The old wells used by the population, no longer reach deep enough. Around the factory, several wells have run dry. In order to ensure good water, the deeper you go, the better it is and also consistent quality because, um, if the water, if you take out water from a shal... shallow surface, it'll be very polluted and it will be very adulterated. So, it is advisable to go very deep. A lot of the law relating to groundwater is unclear. It's unclear who owns groundwater, who has a right to it, whether the state has a right to regulate groundwater, whether people who own land over the groundwater have a right to the resource, or whether a company can come in and pay for the rights of groundwater. These issues haven't been thrashed through, legally, economically, or on any sort of policy forum yet and it remains to be done. Because of Nestlé's booming business with Pure Life, the company has been pumping more and more water out of the ground. But what effect is this having on the groundwater level? And on the quality of water drunk by the people of the village? I asked Nestlé Pakistan about a study they carried out, but got no reply. Medical people tell us the reason is bad water. Kids should not drink it, this girl is continuously sick. If you keep on giving this water to the kids, they keep going to the toilet. They cannot digest the water. They tell us to boil the water first and kill the germs. But we cannot afford to boil it all the time. We are poor people. This water is not consumable. Neither for kids, nor for adults. With this water, different diseases like Hepatitis occur. There is the danger of many diseases spreading. If the people of this village and area can get better water, there will be better health and the diseases will stop. Here in Bhati Dilwan, there are no donation request forms. But the villages have sent a petition to the company. They too, would like to have access to the clean water lying deep down under their village. Nestlé has turned down their request. We asked them for a tube well. At least they should provide us with a small pipe with an outlet of water though the wall. With such a solution, we the villagers could fetch the water this way with cans. They would show us a little gesture. Nestlé, in the end, is-is really stealing the local water sources from people and that's their life, their livelihood, and the livelihoods and lives of their children. Don't forget that bottled water is relatively a small business, it's a drop in the ocean. As a matter of fact, all the water that Nestlé's selling accounts for 0.0009 percent of the fresh water that is being used by the humankind, so, I mean, it's not, not even a drop in the ocean, it's even less. There's certainly irony in the situation that clean drinking water is being extracted, groundwater is being extracted and then being sold as a commodity, essentially to the urban upper class, when people in, uh, a secondary city like Sheikhupura don't get clean drinking water themselves. The river Ravi is a floating cesspit. Where the environment is at its most polluted, that's where clean water is at its most precious. From Pakistan, Nestlé even exports its Pure Life to Afghanistan. According to the United Nations, some 900 million people throughout the world have no access to clean water. Water from the bottle has a promising future. So, shouldn't we be grateful to Nestlé for supplying such a safe product? Is it the company's fault that many people cannot afford it? The Sixth International Human Rights Forum opened this morning in Lucerne. The event is usually a peaceful affair. But this year is different. Because of the participation of Nestlé's chairman, Peter Brabeck. Members of the Swiss workers union say that Nestlé itself violates human rights and has no place at such a forum. (speaking foreign language) To say simply, that water is a human right is perhaps not enough In reality, it is not a matter of whether water is a human right, because quite clearly, it is. It's more a question of how can we implement this human right. We shouldn't reflect so much on whether water is a human right. But rather reflect how to ensure permanent access to water in daily life. There are also a few other basic problems which need solving. The most important point, without question, is that more must be invested in water infrastructure. And secondly, there should be no subsidies for the owners of swimming pools and golf courses and for biofuels produced from plants cultivated specifically for this purpose. But there should be subsidies for water for the poorest and nature. Peter Brabeck is proudly presenting his biography. Top-shots of Swiss big business have turned up in his honor. (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) In his book, Peter Brabeck again stresses the importance of water as a human right, but also as a source of profit for his company. I have often wondered what is the most important single factor that could ensure a company continuing for another 140 years. And I always come to the same conclusion-water. We need water. Our consumers need water in order to live. We need water to grow raw materials. We need water in our manufacturing operations, and we need water to prepare our products. For Nestlé water is the most critical and most important factor for sustainability. I can see now a higher level of recognition of, uh, water being the issue that we have to tackle, than perhaps, climate change, which I think is absolutely right. I have said before, we will be running out of water long before we are running out of oil. Together, we can influence, we can alter, we can protect and preserve the vital resource of water for future generations. We want the world to prosper for at least another 4,500 years, and that's what global corporate citizenship is all about. Lagos is the largest city in Nigeria, and probably in Africa. Some 15 million people live here. The vast majority of the population is dependent on packaged drinking water. Most popular is sachet water, so called, pure water. A half a liter costs 5 naira, that's about 2 US-cents. The water is well packed, but it's not always pure. Sachet water is frequently the cause of bacterial infection, especially among children. The same goes for locally produced bottled water. Nestlé Pure Life has been available in Nigeria since 2005. Clean, safe drinking water in the upper price sector. We have various multinationals in Nigeria that invest in the water. Like Nestlé, the same thing happens to Coca-Cola, that is producing Eva water, and many others, as a matter of fact. So you see, um, these are, uh, multinationals that understand importance of water. They know that in Nigeria water supply is still at its, you know, infantile stage. So that the government hasn't really taken proper hold of providing enough water for the nationals and for the citizens. So the industry is indeed profiting and exploiting the weakness of government, and in doing this, the person who is holding the wrong end of the stick is the ordinary citizen, who is helpless. He doesn't know how safe the water he is drinking is. Nestlé Pure Life, a bottle of it, is more expensive than the daily income of many Nigerians. That Pure Life bottle is even more expensive than a liter of Patrón. A liter of Patrón in Nigeria is 65 naira, and there you have one bottle of that Nestlé water costing above 100 naira. In Lagos, corruption and mismanagement have brought the public water supply system almost to a standstill. Even in the upper class quarters, water is delivered to homes on pushcarts instead of through the pipe. You can be sure of a permanent supply of running water only if you drill your own well and operate a diesel generator to pump the water into the tank on your roof. Only the rich can afford safe, clean water because our income, per capita, is decreasing, even in middle class, some of them can no longer afford it because what they have at their income may not be able to take care of their basic needs. So that already is encroaching into the economy, and that also is opening up more people to the hazards of drinking bad water. Located in the lagoon of Lagos is Makoko. It's a slum neighborhood built on stilts. (speaking foreign language) I was told that Makoko lives from fishing, but in the Lagos lagoon, too, fish are rarely to be seen. (speaking foreign language) The residents of Makoko also have to buy their drinking water from businessmen who have set up water stations in the slums. The water is of doubtful quality. It's piped here from the mainland from a private well. (speaking foreign language) It is not easy to fetch water. It is a long way to the water stations. Sometimes the pumps don't work because there is no petrol. Then you have to go to another station that is even further away. And there are only four stations around. For our family, the daily budget is six dollars. Half of that we use to buy water. This money has to suffice for a family of 12. Buying sachet water for her baby son is almost a luxury for 16-year old Mary Setondji. The family makes kulikuli, little yam balls, which it sells in the neighborhood. In the marketplace, empty PET bottles are sold. Pure Life, Makoko style. (speaking Nigerian) Cholera and typhus are rampant in Makoko, even the slum dwellers know that. But here, there's simply no alternative. (flies buzzing) The slum continues to grow on its own rotting garbage. The reality in the global south is so powerful now. It is such a life-and-death issue. I mean, more children die everyday from dirty water than from HIV/AIDS, war, traffic accidents and malaria put together, it's the number one killer. And so, when you have that kind of life-and-death situation, and then a company like Nestlé comes in and says, "We've got the answer, Pure Life is the answer." We're going to sell you water that we're gonna take from your very own aquifers when there are no public taps, and when you turn the water on half the time nothing comes out, and the other half, when it does, it's polluted and you wouldn't use it, then there... there, you know, then I... I have to go beyond saying that it's irresponsible, to say that... This is almost a criminal act. In the Third World today... in the Third World in general, more than 96 percent of drinking water supplies are in the hands of the state. And it doesn't work. And that has nothing to do with privatization. Why don't you want to get away from this ideology? The problem is not privatization or non-privatization. The problem is that there is no investment to ensure a reliable water supply system. The problem is that in the Third World... in Europe there is a loss of 30 to 35 percent because of infrastructural defects. In the Third World the loss is 60 to 70 percent of piped water. That's the problem. Who now deals with this problem doesn't matter. If the state wants to deal with it, let it. There's no easy short-term solution to that, but I do say, however, that the answer is not a, uh, inadequate or corrupt government combined with a transnational corporation that's in there for their own profit. That's the deadliest combination of all. And our argument to the World Bank is if you've got money to provide water services for these... in these communities where there isn't good government, then lets set up an arm's-length, um, agency that runs on those efficiency principles, but is not for profit. In a backyard in Lagos, this company called Golden Dip is producing sachet water. The brand is Akuro, and it's considered to be clean and trustworthy. I believe that this will make me rich. We produce like 2,000 bags. Inside one bag you have 200 half-liter pieces, or 120 pieces with the 75 centileters content. The procedure for bottled water is a little bit hard because we are using manual production. First we fill the bottle, then comes the wrapper topper and the mould. All that takes a lot of time. So our production of bottles is just minimal. Let me say 50 cartons of bottled water a day. This entrepreneur has invested a lot of money in a filter system. He wants to expand further into the bottled water business. For all of us who just started, I can say Nestlé has been heard all over the world, while our business is just Lagosian now. So, you know, there is a great difference between the two. But we are praying to grow like them. All right, runners, Z100 and Poland Spring bring actual spring water right here to keep you moving, let's go! It is mile 17. Kate and Jen, we've got your water. Come on up here, guys. It's the 2009 ING New York City Marathon you've been training for and you know we are here with Poland Spring Natural Spring Water... It is the official water of the 2009 ING New York City Marathon, keeping all our runners hydrated, like Ben, Ben is staying hydrated. We got Louise, come on, mama, you can do it. Let's go, let's go, let's go! At the New York Marathon, nearly a quarter of a million liters of Poland Spring water are given away, free. It's all part of Nestlé's aggressive marketing strategy, and it's successful. More and more people have Poland Spring drinking water from Maine delivered to their homes. From untouched nature direct into the refrigerator, Poland Spring has become the top-selling spring water in New York. With its population of eight million, New York is the biggest beverage market on the American east coast. Wherever I drive, I see the green delivery trucks. Every year, in the USA alone, the beverage industry uses up more than 800,000 tons of plastic. Four out of five PET bottles in the US end up as garbage, along roadsides, or in the sea. The shelves in the shopping centers of today are piled high with the garbage of tomorrow. New Yorkers drink bottled water when they have access to the cleanest, best water in the world that comes from the Catskills. It is the cleanest, safest water you could possibly drink. It's just marketing. It suddenly became cool and they connected it to health, and they even told us we needed eight glasses a day, which by the way, is not true, and they... and they told us that we had to always have it on... Our little hydrating tool that we had to have it on us at all times. So I talk to kids now and they'll say, "Okay, I'm trying to understand what you're saying but how would I get from my house to my school without water?" I mean, this is brilliant marketing. And, uh, you know, they've made tons of money telling us basically a lie. From New York, I head off again to Maine, some 600-kilometers to the north. I need to know the latest on the legal wrangling about the pumping stations. Welcome to a special edition of RadioActive: A Grassroots Environmental and Social Justice News Journal. Today's call-in topic is on large-scale corporate water extraction and community control. Nestlé, the world's largest food and beverage company, owns the bottled water label Poland Springs in Maine, currently extracting from eight wells in the state, with intentions to expand. Town residents objecting to the sale of their water find themselves in positions of limited recourse within current regulatory processes. In the town of Fryeburg, the bulldozers are in action. The battle around the second pumping station went up to the highest court in the state of Maine. The town of Fryeburg lost. Nestlé is allowed to go ahead. Soon, the company will be loading up its tankers with even more local spring water, legally. Fryeburg was granted only the right to limit the number of tanker trips. It has since set this limit at 36,000 per year. It's a sad, sad tragic commentary on what's legal and what's theft. You know, is it legal to steal? Is it ethically and morally... It... what's legal and what's ethical and moral are two different things. You don't betray people. You know, it's like the courts that are supposed to defend you betrayed you. And you feel, you feel betrayed. (traffic sounds) But here in Fryeburg, Nestlé doesn't only have enemies. Some of the local residents are pleased with the court's decision. Fryeburg needs a tax base. They need jobs, they need some things that would come into town, even though it's been a little bit rocky for them, in terms of number of folks in town that didn't want them here, or that don't like the whole idea of bottled water. They've made major contributions to the town. They've funded a couple of temporary classrooms, they've helped the local academy build a gym, they've supported the Tin Mountain Conservation Center, and they've done a number... Well, they've... they've supported a ski... a ski team at the academy, so they are really trying to be good neighbors. I'm one of the ones that was trying to put the stop to the pump station in east Fryeburg, which is a quarter mile from my house, and I've been helping battle this for almost four-and-a-half years, at the cost of $60,000 in legal fees that a bunch of us have put together. So, you know, it's changed my whole life now. I live in a rural, residential-zoned area, nice and quiet with four kids, and now I've gotta listen to who knows how many trucks going by my house, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I don't want anything to do with them, and I refuse to buy anything that's made by Nestlés. If I have to go hungry, I will. That's my feeling. So you can tell, I'm pretty angry about it, and I'm not the only one. They are corrupting the process in my community, a community that... Three generations graduated from the high school... That have been here for centuries, and they're... they're orchestrating the process so that they will eventually win. Whether they'll win because people are beat down and they're... They're tired of the fight, or they don't even have the money to pay for the lawyers. Nestlé has unlimited legal funds. You know, we don't have the legal funds, we don't have the PR machines behind us, but if you look at their message in Fryeburg, their good neighbor policy, and you look at their message throughout the country, they're all very self-serving. They have a project called Project Wet for water education in the community school systems. Well, oh gee, they did a pilot program in Fryeburg. Isn't that interesting? And then they can say, "Look we did a pilot program for Project Wet for water education. Look, we're helping the community." Well, you're helping the community conserve water while you're taking 150 million gallons out of the community. (trucks idling) In the Wildlife Preserve, the story had another ending. Here, Nestlé has been defeated. The company must remove its test wells from the protected area. The towns of Shapleigh and Newfield have declared all water in their territories to be a fundamental right. Water belongs to nature and may be used only by the local residents. Large-scale pumping and commercialization of the water is no longer permitted. Both Shapleigh and Newfield have cited the right to local self-determination, a right which is anchored in the Constitution of the USA. All of us have the same passion, and once we found out that we couldn't, you know, work under the regulatory approach, we had to find something in order to keep them out, and that's how we found that... the rights space, and we went around again to educate the people about the rights space, and we pretty much said, "If you want Nestlé into your community, then go the regulatory approach. That will regulate them." If they come in, fill out the permit, cross their Ts, dot their Is, you cannot say no to this large company." And God forbid if you ever wanna regulate anything stricter with them once they're in, because you will never win in court. Ask Fryeburg. Now you have chosen an instrument which is quite new, this rights-based ordinance. It's something that... It's brand new in the state of Maine. It's brand new in the state, you were the first, and even in the States. - Yes. - It hasn't been tested in court. With the rights space, we go to court with the Constitution on our side. You know, the Constitution, protect the people. So, I would rather have the rights space on my side, and the community, than the regulatory because we've seen the regulatory not work. We've seen Nestlé go to court and win several times, and not just in Maine, all around the country. So, if I had a choice of either having the rights space or the... or the regulatory on my side going to court, it would be the rights space. This is where Shapleigh's Board of Selectmen holds its meetings. In fact, the board had opposed the local women's demand to carry their fight to constitutional level. So, we wanted to get the rights space ordinance on the town warrant where everybody would vote it. Well, the selectmen again said, "No, we're not gonna do it." And you know, this is a majority of citizens they... who elected these people. So they said, "Nope, we're not gonna do it," so... So they refused the citizen's petition. They refused to allow the citizens to vote on a petition that they gave to their own selectmen. So there's a little loophole in the law... Which Gloria found. ...where we could call our own town meeting. All right, the votes were dubbed The Shapleigh Water Rights of Local Government being active in the town of Shapleigh. At this time, all those in favor of adopting that ordinance, please so indicate by raising your ballot. With 114 votes to 66, the women won the day for water as a fundamental right, and against Nestlé. Shortly after Shapleigh, neighboring Newfield voted likewise. The Wildlife Preserve will remain untouched. (chatter) Well, hello, everybody. The reason why we're here today is to celebrate our victory, our awesome victory, in Newfield and Shapleigh. (cheering and clapping) I think one of the major accomplishments that we've all made in Shapleigh and Newfield is all of us coming together and working for one issue. And every single person here had played an enormous role in it, and we could not have done it without each and every one of you, so again... (cheering and clapping) So it really was a whole grassroots effort and if it's... I think it's just unbelievable because many of us were never activists and it's all thanks to you, and I just wanna say that I'm very humble having that experience, and I think of all of you as friends, and again, thank you very much. (cheering and clapping) ♪ God bless America ♪ Land that we love ♪ Stand beside her ♪ And guide her ♪ Through the night with the light from above ♪ ♪ From the mountains to the prairies ♪ ♪ To the oceans white with foam ♪ It's a small victory achieved by two small towns in the hinterland of Maine. But who can resist in countries where there is little democracy, and even less water? In Pakistan, or in Nigeria. Clean drinking water is becoming increasingly precious. Some can afford the luxury of bottled water, but the others... To whom does the water on our planet belong?
