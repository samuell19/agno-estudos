I need consultants to help them hide their consultants. Sounds to me like you're doin' PowerPoint. You still good? Kid was still workin' on it when I left. Said he'd turn it over as soon as he was done. We did a logarithmic progression, placing different weights in different customer groups, in order to remove any biases that existed in previous analysis... Yeah, Appendix. Well if you just look at the r-square... Appendix. Point eight-three. Yeah. That's Appendix. That's good. I actually ran 10 different... Appendix. You're pullin' the fuckin' ocean, kid.

I think she thinks some switch will flip and all of a sudden I'll be home by 5:45 every night. God, take-out food, DVDs, be in bed by 10:30. Some people don't know what they're missing. Thanks for the study break. Hey. So like, um, how much do directors make, anyway? I mean, if you make director. When you make director. Stop thinkin' about money. Eyes on the prize. I thought that was the prize. No, the prize is winning. Money's just a way of keeping score. I think we're lookin' really good. Team is good, deck is solid, we just need a date and a little bit of luck. You got me, Sean. We don't need luck. Neil, it's James. Will you please call me back? Look, man, I don't, I don't know how to get a hold of you. I've been trying to call you at work. I don't know how to say this. Dad, uh. Dad died. You gotta come home. Neil. You have a brother? We're not that close. Well look, man, I don't mean to be insensitive or anything, but the timing here isn't exactly great. Relax, Sean. Apparently he's already found a buyer. We just need to pack up our shit and sign a few papers, make sure the real estate agent isn't some sort of nut job. Well, that sounds like a lot of fun. Um, sorry to miss it. So, when was the last time you went back there, anyway? A while. Hi, this is James Mercer, please leave me a message after the beep. Hey man, I'm here. You're not. Call me. James. Hey. Neil, how you doin'? Good, man. Good to see ya. Neil, I want you to meet my fiancee, Rebecca. Rebecca, this is my brother Neil. Fiancee. Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Um, I'm sorry about your dad. Thank you. Who's hungry? Pamela made it sound like these buyers are pretty motivated. Yeah, of course she did, she's a real estate agent. Yeah, I, I mean, I think she's pretty involved. Is she the same one who actually told him to move out of the house before she had a potential buyer? Yeah, well, I mean, I think that was his call, but... How about the color in the front room, was that his choice? Oh, the puce? Ugh, God. You didn't like that? I kinda like white better. Drinks? Yeah, uh, I'm gonna have whiskey. You want a whiskey? Um. Oh, nice, they have that local wine I was telling you about. Can we get two of the St. Julian Rieslings? Whiskey and wine, coming right up. Thanks. Thanks. What are you, on the wagon? No, it's supposed to be pretty good. Isn't this the place you were telling me has the good milkshakes? No, that's Oink's, remember? This is the place with the really good burgers. Ah, Oink's, that's right. Oink's. Yeah. It's a great name. Yeah. It was, oh God, we used to drive our bikes there like three times a day. Neil would convince 'em to, like, shoot the Reddi-wip directly down our mouths. Remember? Anyway, um, so what are you gonna be doin' while we're out dealing with the house? Rebecca is a photographer. I take pictures. Well, you make photographs, you're a photographer. You mean like, uh, industrials, or fashion, like? Um, landscape. Ah, there's a good buck in that. Well, she's actually here on commission. I don't know if I would say that. I would, it's true. You should never sell yourself short. That's like one of your consultancy slogans, right? I could tell ya, but I'd have to bill ya. Ah. What do you think? That's a good one. Mm. Fruity? Is it, more savory? What did you say this was? This is St. Julian Riesling. Okay. It's from, you know, just down the road. What do you think? You guys want another round? Another? Thanks. No, it's all right, that's for you. Thank you, sir. Your girl seems all right. Yeah, we're doin' okay. Yeah, she keeps me in line. So how was he in the end? Hard-ass, you know, same as always. Yeah, some things never change, right? Yeah. Well, he asked about you, how you were. Yeah, what'd you say? Eh, you were workin'. Is there gonna be, like, a memorial or somethin'? In the spring. Figured more people would be able to come that way. Guess I should make an appearance. How about you, how you doin'? How's the jazz goin'? Yeah, slowly but surely. Good. What about you, man? What's it like bein' a big-time consultant? Ah, same old shit. She all right? Yeah, she's just, usin' the bathroom. How did you do that? We were standing right there. Magic. Are you smokin'? Honey, I don't want you smokin'. I know, you'd be lost without me. Ah, Jesus, man. I know, you'd be lost without me. Hey, is that place Oink's still open? No, I don't think so. You wanna go check it out? I gotta make some calls. No, man, let's go check out Oink's. Hey, what time's our meeting tomorrow? 9 a.m., bright and early. All right, I'm gonna get goin', it's too cold out here for me. You'll get used to it. It's two days, James. I won't have to. Well, we brought Monopoly. First one back gets the battleship. Mashed potatoes, so I'll give you a few minutes to look that over and I'll get your drinks. Okay, thanks. What's a guy gotta do to get some service around here? Oh my God, Neil Mercer, what are you doing here? I don't believe it. It's good to see you. Good to see you. Um, let me just put this in and uh, I'll, I'll be right back. It's weird having you here. Yeah, you're one to talk, how'd they manage to keep you here this whole time? Well, when you marry one of 'em. Yeah, it's five years this September. Doesn't seem so long when you say it out loud, but. Little Beth Wilson, all grown up. It was then or never. I'm surprised it took that long. Well, you know me, breakin' hearts from the day I was born. You were always breakin' hearts, you just never realized it. Thanks for tellin' me now. Better late than never. What about you? You're not gettin' any younger. Hmm. One of those California blondes snatch you up? They're not as dumb as you think. Man, we were all so in love with you in high school. We would spend all year with those thuggy jock assholes and then you'd come around in the summers wearin' your polos and your khakis, talkin' about Shakespeare and Mozart. Now, that kid was a charmer. No, that kid was an idiot. Aw, come on, you were a catch and you know it. We were all so jealous of Charlotte. How is that old girl, anyway? Why? You wanna look her up and see if the flame's still burning? No, I just wanna make sure she's gotten over me. Well, it was a long time ago. I bet she's moved on. Maybe I should come back here more often, try to, uh, you know, recapture some of my former glory. Yeah, definitely. Could use somebody around here who remembers how to drink. I'm not as fun as I used to be. I find that hard to believe. Sorry, I can't. You don't sound so convinced. Neil. I'm married. What does that matter? You're different from how I remember you. Yeah, well, I grew up. I gotta get back. Hello! Welcome to the New Buffalo Motel. Uh, do you have a reservation with us? Do I need one? Uh, busy place. What was that name, sir? Uh, it's Neil Mercer. Neil Mercer, what brings you to New Buffalo, sir? Uh, a little vacation. Good time of year for it. Snow's always beautiful, isn't it? It's cold. You guys have a bar here? Having fun out there, Boss? A blast. How we lookin'? Still waiting. Shouldn't be long now. The kid seem ready? I don't think he's been home since you left. He'll be ready. Good man. Listen, I know you know this. But this pitch is important, Neil. We need you here. Mm. There he is. We were startin' to get worried about you. How was Oink's? Eh, they were closed for the winter. But you did miss a really good game of Monopoly. Yeah, I ran into an old friend. Oh yeah? She everything you remember? Better. Hm. Um-hm. Sorry I missed the meeting. How was it? It was good. Pamela has a couple ideas about the house. Nothin' big, list is in the other room if you wanna take a look. So what did James have to do to convince you to come up here in the middle of February? Mm, promise me eternal happiness and undying love? Sounds like you got the short end of the stick. Mm, this is pretty good, when'd you learn how to cook? You didn't teach him? Must've learned on his own. Mm-hm, he's very good at cooking. Yeah, and a couple other things. Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm. Like what else? A couple more things. Like what? Stop, stop. Like what? Come on. What? Gimme some space. Excuse me. You don't think I'm good at things? What, of course I think you're good at things. Christ, you guys read this list? Hm? The list, all the shit on here. "Debris removal, including all leaves "and other tree-related items. "Busted pipe in bathroom. "Gutter cleaning. "Fence repair, laundry washer/dryer hookup repair. "Garage door opener repair." I thought you said the buyers were motivated. They are. Pamela just thinks it'll help. Probably shouldn't take more than a week. A week? Thought we could all do it together, be fun. You said two days, James, a week is seven days. Uh, well we might be able to finish earlier, between the three of us. I got an idea, why don't we just call Mom. Maybe Dad'll rally, you know? We could have a family reunion. Don't encourage him. It's not funny. Sorry. It's called a sense of humor, James. You got two days, okay? You wanna eat, Neil? Guess not. Get you another? Yeah, sure, please. You grow up around here? Born and raised, New Buffalo High. Class of 95, go Cougars. You wouldn't happen to know a girl named Charlotte Spier, she used to work here? Tall, brunette, kind of willowy, kinda pretty? Um, it doesn't ring a bell. Sorry. Hey. Creeper. No, I get it. It's just, you know, I wish... It'll only be a few days, I promise we'll... Okay. Hey, Dad coulda left the bed in my room. That air mattress is killin' my back. Sorry, I wasn't consulted. Look man, I got some bad news. I got a gig. A gig? And it starts tonight. Tonight? The band they had scheduled canceled, and we were next on the list, and it's something I have to take. We got work to do. I gotta take it, man, I'm sorry. My flight leaves tomorrow, James. I know, I'm sorry, it's shitty. But I have no option, okay? This is something I gotta take, these guys depend on me, it's a great opportunity. Well, how long is it for? Five days. Five days? I don't know what to say, like, what am I supposed to say, I can't do it 'cause my brother would be disappointed in me? It's just something I gotta do, I'm sorry. All you gotta say, that you got a responsibility, that's what you do when you're an adult. Look, man, you don't actually have to do anything, just call Pamela, arrange to get a good handyman over here, and they'll take it from there. Okay, so, I'm just gonna, you know, clean up everything myself? Just do me a favor, all right? I'll owe you one? You already owe me one, I came here to be with you and to take care of the house and now you're leaving? Man, like I've never done anything for you. I gotta make a call. What have you done for me? Well, I am the one who's been around for the past 15 years. That was your choice, man, don't pin that shit on me. If you need to leave, leave. All right? Wouldn't be anything new. You know, it's your mess, James, then you clean it up, okay? This is Pamela Ross, sorry I missed your call. Leave me a message and I'll call you back just as soon as I can. Have a wonderful day. Pam, hi, this is Neil Mercer. I'm James' brother. Listen, I'm here to help him out for a few days, and uh, get a handyman. Um, call me back, please. Got a Yellow Pages? This is Joe.

All right, well, you know anybody that might be open, that, you know, look, I'll make it worth your while. Fuck. Sorry, I was all out. What are you doin' here? Smoking all your cigarettes. Uh huh. I have shit to do. You have shit to do? I have work to do. That requires that I be here. So, I'm here working, like a real adult. I understand that you disapprove of James' priorities, but you know what, he's no longer here, so. His what? What are you talking about? He left, didn't he? Asshole. You havin' fun out there? You know, I hear there's some really nice hotels in the area. Oh yeah? I'll call you a cab. Coffee's on the house. Aah! Nice job. Your phone buzzed. Call me and we'll get this ball rolling ASAP. "Call me and we'll get this ball rolling ASAP." How we gonna do anything ASAP if she doesn't pick up her goddamn phone? I mean, we are paying her, right? The least she could do is pretend to give a shit. Do you find that's usually how it works? Actually, that's always how it works. Is it hard? Finding out the world cares as little as you do? All right. ♪ In the mornin' light ♪ ♪ She trades it for the claim ♪ Is, uh, Beth, uh, Beth working tonight? Can I help you with somethin'? Yeah, you could start by telling me where all the women are in this fucking town. No, I'm kidding. Uh, you got whiskey, right? Just a double. I think we should start a little slower... Oh, really, I think you should start by doing your fucking job. One for me, one for my pops for old times' sake. Think you oughta just keep movin', friend. Do I look like a guy who has friends around here? Look at this fucking place. Why don't you just keep drinking your beer? Oh, hello, I was just asking Tom Cruise here about you. What's goin' on? I'm tryin' to get you a drink, but he won't pour the fucking drinks, just pour the fucking drink. Okay, buddy, time to go. I am not talking to you. We're not talkin', I'm talkin' to my friend, not you. So stay out of it, you asshole. Just stay the fuck out of it. Gimme my drink, please. I think we're done here. Really? Neil, you gotta go. There's nothin' here for you. You know what, Beth, take a look around. There's nothin' here for anybody. Enjoy your life. Oh, shit. Fuck. Fuck it. Where is that number. Charlotte. Come on. The number you have reached is not in service at this time, and there is no new number. I think they heard you. How long was the horn going off? Five minutes. I thought you were leaving. Yeah well, I thought James was gonna be here to help, so. I have a proposition for you. Pass. I know you're never gonna finish this stuff on your own. I'm leaving, remember? I don't need to finish. If you were gonna leave, you would have already left. I'll help you with your little list if you help me with my commission. I don't really speak artist. I just need to know what around here is worth taking pictures of. And how are you gonna help me? You should've brought something warmer. I don't have anything warmer.

Yeah, yeah, he hired me to take pictures of what he said was the most beautiful place on God's green earth. If this is the most beautiful place on God's green earth, then why'd he wanna sell? Makes sense to me. James is always traveling, and you're in LA, he probably just thought there wasn't anyone there to use it. Huh, guess he was right about that. So, your dad died, and the office hired me to take the pictures anyway, and use it as kind of a memorial. Pretty impressive, huh? He's dead and he still has people working for him. What's your deal, anyway? It sounds like you haven't been home in forever. You know, your dad dies and you get on a plane, right? Yeah, you just don't seem all that excited to be here. I got a lot of stuff on my plate. Like big-shot consultancy stuff? Somethin' like that. James said you moved out here after college for a while? You need to get a hobby. Come on, tell me the story, I love stories. Story, there is no story. I'm sure James left some things out. I'll make you a deal, the next time we're up here I'll tell you everything. Great, I'll put it in my calendar. I think I used to play tennis with that guy's daughter. I think you mean that little girl's mom. Guess I'm older than I thought. Life happens, man, you gotta get with the program. Yeah, live alone, die alone, what's the difference? Lifetime of happiness in between? Pretty thought. Sounded better in my head. I'm starving. Wanna get outta here? So how long you been taking pictures? I don't know, a while. Yeah, you like it? Keeps me busy. So what's the draw? Everything ends, and a picture remains? That's not bad for a consultant. I have my moments. I guess for me, it's like a thing doesn't exist until you photograph it. It's just floating around in the ether, but the photograph makes it mean something. One picture makes it real. So this is what you and James normally do on Friday night? Mm-mm. We usually just fuck. Mm. Sorry to be so boring. Hm. At least the pizza's good. I'm gonna get a whiskey, you want one? Mm, sure. Hey, is everything okay? Oh yeah, fine, I'm just taking pictures. Better offer? Raincheck. How are things with you? I wonder where he could be, I'm getting worried. Are you, darling, what about? Charles, you've changed. Don't you think you'd better?

You want a refill or something? I'm just gonna throw it out otherwise. At this point, I don't think coffee's gonna cut it. Tell me about it. Doesn't seem like a very good business model, throwing away coffee at a coffee shop. Last chance. Nah, I'm good, thanks. You live around here? Not for long. My boyfriend and I moved here after school. He figured working construction for the summer would be a quick way of paying off some loans. That was six years ago. Hm, you know there's a train station right down the road. There's a actually a road right next to the train station. You could just. Maybe it just seemed easier, you know? Why not try and make the most of it? Gets exhausting always hoping to find something better. Yeah, but there always is something better. Sean. I have some good news, Neil. We have a date. This Friday, 11 a.m. About time, huh? Honestly, this deck is as crisp as I've ever seen. Amir's turning into our own little rockstar. You will be here, right? We need you in that room. I'll be there. I'll send a car. Gotta be kidding me. Hello Neil, tag, you're it. Little joke there. Listen, if you have a second, I've got one small job for you. Find us some plants, evergreens. I know it's not exactly the season, but I think it will really spruce up that garage. Okay, great. And let me know if you have any more trouble finding a handyman. I look forward to seeing you very soon. I think you were actually out. You don't say. Thanks for the sandwich. It's on the house. Chop-chop, LA. Time to get to work. See, it's better out here in the summer, but. Yep, you do keep saying that. I learned to play golf right over there. We used to plow through dinner to get in as many holes as we could. I didn't know James played golf. He didn't really play all that much. I think it was a little too slow for him. Mostly only Dad and I. Well, golf is the most boring sport of all time. How do you know, you ever play? No. Well don't knock it 'til you try it. James and I did have a good time out here, though. I used to come home from college and buy him beers. Wasn't he, like, 13 years old? Yeah. You must have been pretty popular. It didn't hurt. And then what? You moved out west? Yeah, I moved to LA and James moved to Chicago. You know, as you said, life just happens. I meant, you grow up and get old, not lose touch with your brother. Just couldn't take care of him anymore. I always had to take care of him. My dad was always working or drinking. At some point, it was just easier not to talk. Not to come back. James doesn't want you to take care of him. He just wants you to be his brother. It's not too late, you know. So you still play? Jesus. Okay, try again. Okay. All right. All right, now you're gonna hinge right there, more hinge right there, follow through. All right, come on LA, now's your chance. Let me see what you got. No, I can't, I play leftie. So, where are your clubs? I couldn't find 'em. So play rightie. I can't play rightie, it's a whole different, I don't wanna break anything. You mean like, your vagina? Like my vagina, just go ahead. On three, ready? One, two, Three. Not bad. You ready to go? Yeah. Well, if the handyman stuff doesn't work out, you could always go into landscaping. Come on, I'm starving. You sure you never played pool before? This isn't exactly my forte. Yeah, your forte, should we go home and get your camera back? That's not my forte, either. Oh yeah? It's what I do now. But... What was it? I danced. I know, I let myself go or whatever. No, I, I didn't mean that, I just, what kind of dance? Ballet. How long? 16 years. That's a long time. Yeah, it is. Another round? Uh, yes, actually no, I'm gonna switch to whiskey. Want a whiskey? Yeah, I will. Two, thanks. All right, so then what happened? Uh, I made it as far as Paris, and I danced there for about eight months, and then my mom got sick, so I went home to take care of her, and then I met a boy. And then I met another boy. Well, love conquers all. Yeah. I think I just pick guys I know will get bored with me. Yeah, I don't think James is that type. So, did you ever think about going back to dance? Yep, but at that level, a year away is a long time, and I don't know, once you, once you can't even do the thing you were built to do, it's sort of like... Yeah, what good are you? Well, past is past, right? You can't go back. Thank you. You know, I left Rome for a girl. I knew it, I knew you had a story. Eh, it's not much of a story. What were you doing in Rome? I was studying to be an opera singer. You fuckin' with me? No. You wanna hear my high G? Are you serious? The upper end of the baritone register. My top was always better than my bottom. That was a long time ago. Yes, it was. My shot? Your shot? Um, I think it's me. ♪ I lost myself in the jackknife daylight ♪ ♪ Well I got a woman ♪ ♪ We're a heaven-made match you see ♪ Oh Neil, I am so glad you're back. I am just meeting these guys, they're from here, too. You also grew up around here, can you believe it? I can't believe it. Did you know them? No, I do not know them. Before today? I think we should go, let's go. Be cool, man. I got shots comin'. You like shots? We're gonna have a good time. He loves them. I'm... Yeah. Ooh, yummy. Okay, here we go. Anything for you? No, I'm good. Okay. Cheers. Thank you. Ehh. All right, let's go. Want another? Want another one? I do want another one. Nah, I think we should get going. What about our game? Yeah, because I was thinking that you and me can play together on a team of our own, against these guys for pool. For like pool versus. The valet is waiting outside with our car so we should, come on. What? Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Watch the tree! Here we go. You gonna make it? I just need one more and I will be good. Of what? Wouldn't you like to know? All right, here we go. All right, you good? Mm, socks. You gotta be kidding. Please. I'm not Please, please. All right. Socks. All right. Here we go, your left sock, right sock. Over here. Good? Good night? Oh, pants! Pants. Come on. You're not serious. Just pull my pants off, asshole, I can't. Ah, jeez... Come on. You know, this is not me Please. Being an asshole, trust me. Just it's too tight. Yep. You good? Extremely. All right. Hey, I got an idea. How about, you buy James out, and we move in here, and start a home repair business together. Open year-round. I don't know how useful I would be. I'm sure you're good for something. Good night, Rebecca. Hey Sean, it's me. Listen man, uh, I've hit a little bit of a snag here. I need you to, uh, buy me a few more days, okay? Do whatever it takes. You boys out there somewhere? Right here, boss. Amir, are you there? Hey, yeah, Neil, sorry, I'm here. All right, are you ready to bring this deal home? Ready as we'll ever be. All right, grab a pen. Hey. Hey. Any more where that came from? So what happens when this runs out? I'll find out. When you were 15, where did you go to solve your 15 year-old problems? James' gig is ending. What time's he coming back? I don't know, soon. It's not that long a drive. That girl, the one you told me about, that you left Rome for? Whatever happened with her? She and I lived here together for a while. Then I got a job in LA, and she wanted to come with, and I talked her out of it. I told her I thought it was probably for the best. Love conquers all, huh? Hm. I know how this ends, you know. James, he just sees the good in me, but what if I'm not what he signed on for? What if I'm defective, and he hasn't realized it yet? It's not that he leaves. It's that he always comes back. I think there's a little bit of whiskey left. I think I'm just gonna go to bed. Will there be anything else? No, I think we're good, thanks. It's nice to see two pretty young faces. Gets so dreary here in the winter. We're not as young as you think. Oh, I'll bet you probably are. You make a nice couple. There's no rush. You hear that? That's the best compliment you're gonna get all day, you better enjoy it. Let's just think about how much better my eggs are than these. Maybe you could make them for me sometime. When we have our own home repair business. Open year-round. You think that story ends any differently? Gotta believe in something. I will add this to your tab. Ready? Well hello, hello, we finally meet. Pamela Ross. Hi, Neil Mercer. Ah, car trouble? Sorry for the delay. It's been the craziest winter, you wouldn't believe. This is Steve and Judy Bradley. Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Neil Mercer, the owner of this lovely house. This is Rebecca Brandt. Lovely to see you again. I didn't want any more time to slip by, so, here we all are. Shall we have a look around? Yeah, uh... I, I think I'm just gonna take a walk. You sure? We're only gonna be a few minutes. Yeah, yeah, this is, uh, what you came to do, so. Okay. Shall we? It's so lovely when the weather is nice. I can't imagine a more magical place for two boys to spend their summers. See the birch trees? Well, this couldn't be going any better. You did a nice job here. Let's hope they like it. I was sorry to hear about your father. Oh, thank you. So you're just in from Los Angeles, then? Yeah, just came in for this. You're a very hard person to get a hold of. Well, you know how it is, busy busy. So, you need me much longer? Tell 'em how thrilled you are. Flash a few more smiles, after that? At this point, you don't need to stay any longer than you want. Guys, look over there, past those hills, sledding hills, look down. The other car will be here in few hours. Hey, sorry, I was gone for a while. Hey, man. James, hey. Just got off the phone with Pamela. Sounds like we have a winner. Yeah, apparently they love what we've done with this place, so let's hope the offer sticks. Hope the gig went well. Yeah, oh yeah, it went great. Listen, we grabbed some food, let me cook you some dinner, man. Aw, thanks, I'm actually heading into town, and I got work to do. Welcome back. ♪ Sayin' these things to no one that matters ♪ Another? Yeah, sure. That girl you were asking about the other night, uh, Charlotte whatever? Guess my sister used to play volleyball with her. Said she left town years ago. Oh, your food will be up soon.

Yeah, I ran into an old friend. Yeah, saved you some food, there's a plate in the fridge. I gotta get goin' through some of those boxes. Honestly, man, I can take it over from here now, you've done more than your share. It's not a problem. Thanks for the food. Hey, man. Hey. Listen, I just wanna apologize. I didn't, I didn't mean to leave you hangin' like that. We got it all taken care of. You don't need to apologize. I owe you one. Let's call it even. So, I stopped at Dad's house in the city on the way. I think this is one of the few bottles left in the the cellar. Wow. Bet he wished he got into this. Yeah, bet he wished he got to a lot of things. You know, they say a good bottle of whiskey will outlive you just as long as you don't open it. That makes it kinda tough. Should we do it? Yeah. Cheers. Mm, yep. Yeah. That's good. Do you think we fucked up? Selling the house? You know I guess I just assumed it'd always just be here. Yeah, I kinda did, too. So the memorial's in Spring, huh? April. Think it'll be warmer by then? Hey. When are you leaving? Tomorrow morning. Well, they probably need you back at work since you've been gone so long. It's all right. It's been worth it. Um, James talked to the guys who own Oink's, and they're gonna open special for us, so I figured I'd stick around, see what happens. You should. It'll be good. I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you, too. Hey. Hey. I'd offer you some coffee, but we don't have any more. James went to go get some.
