This is for 40 hours. I had 20 hours of overtime, too. - You'll get it next week. TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT Let's go! Or we'll miss the last ferry. Are you taking your own car? - I'll pass this time. Let's dance. Well? Cute guys like you shouldn't sulk here by themselves. You! Come! - Not now... Maybe later. - It's a good tune. Come! Come on! As soon as the season ends, I'll be out of here. As far away as possible. I won't survive another shitty winter like this one. I can't be bothered to go farther. This will do. The fuck! They fuckin' went with them! Good evening, girls! So Finnish guys are not good enough anymore? You deaf or what? - We are. Completely deaf. Estonians have it as tiny as we do. Erik, don't. Don't start. - There he goes. Erik, don't mind. Let's go. You hear me? Fucking thieves. Who's athief here? Fucking dickhead! - Enough! Fuck! Come here! Let me go! Come here, you fuck! Hello. Hello, Moonika. Something happened? So what's going on? That child... It's yours. A girl. I've missed my periods before, too, but nothing has happened. And then it was too late. I didn't want to craw! back to you after that last fight. Liisu said you left for Finland. That was it. What do you mean, it? What do you want now? What do you want? - I don't know. Where were you when I called you 20 times a day to apologise? Fucking.. What do you want? Forget everything and play house with you, is that what you want? Fuck you! You sleeping or what? Pour it over there, too! I have to do this patch first. Okay, dear. Let's go next Saturday then, right? If you won't forget about it again. - Do you have to whine all the time? Why the fuck should I come home at all then? Call Kassu. - Kaspar, come, talk to dad. Hey, dad. - Hey, dude. How was your practice? Sol was thinking... That let's give it a try, then. I'll take some time off from Finland. Do you have some other guy? You can finish the school later. We have to try. I don't get it. Why did you invite me here, to babysit? I don't want this child. What? This reaction is perfectly normal. Hormones working overtime. Many people react like that. Expecting a child is one thing. But when you have the baby, everything seems to be wrong. It doesn't mean you should give up the baby. Most people get the depression from the feeling of failure. Childbirth went wrong, therefore I'm not good for a mother. Your midwife said you did very well. Like you were made for giving birth. It's even harder for fathers. Suddenly, you have this tiny bundle and...- Enough! I don't want it! Hello. Sit down on this chair. Don't be so frightened. Babies are little, but very tough. So.. Here, feed her yourself. Let her eat as much as she wants. Your dinner will come later. Stop it, Imbi. I don't want any coffee. I just don't get what's happening. How can she do this? I guess she's thinking. - What's there to think about? We can't give the child away like a kitten! You have to talk to Moonika. - She has never listened to me. Speak to her again. [ tried. She says that she doesn't want to raise it alone like I did. - Alone? What do you want from me, then? You have nerves of steel. Lucky guy. Wake up! The same drill. Feeding time. The baby is hungry. How was the night? We're making an exception for you. We'll keep the baby in the hospital for a week. Next Monday, there'll be 3 committee hearing. If you haven't decided by then, Child Welfare will take over. Wait... They'll take her to an orphanage or what? First, to a safe home. Then the adopting process will commence. We have a long queue for healthy newborns. Hi, Maybe you'll take off your jacket when you're in here. So, how are you doing? I had a baby. - What? I had a baby. With whom? - With Moonika, of course. But she doesn't want the baby. Wants to give it away or something. But she doesn't want the baby. Wants to give it away or something. I think I will have to take the baby. What do you mean, take it? Alone? The hospital said she has a depression. It pass. Someone has to be with the child until then. You can hardly take care of yourself. Do you realise what life is like with a baby? What will you live on? And where? If I may ask. Don't panic. It's just for a moment. - Foramoment? You are 30! And when you mess up, you still run to Mommy. Did you hear already? Your son has suddenly become afather. Good job. Really good job. Do you acknowledge paternity? Please sign on the dotted line. And the mother's signature... And what shall be the name? What name shall we give to the child? What are the options you are considering? We can help you choose. I wouldn't recommend too many names. It's not an Estonian custom. Mai. - Excuse me? Let's put Mai, like the month, May. And the father's last name, right? And the custody? What does it mean? It means, who will get the baby. Will you raise it together or the mother alone? Do we have to decide now? - Yes. Then write my name down, for now. Congratulations! Your room is ready. My God, you can't even fasten the seatbelt correctly! Let's have some coffee. Mom will manage. Let's have some coffee. Mom will manage. Here. I don't have any glasses. I don't know how you can stand the constant nagging. You'll see yourself soon enough. Father may be, but mother has to be. Moonika will calm down eventually, too. Maternal instinct will kick in and it'll be alright. So, good luck and hang in there. Daddy. I have to go out for a second. What? I can't go to the toilet? Are you actually sure? I mean... When you were together... How do you know it's yours? She looks exactly like me. Yeah... Right after the birth. What if Moonika will not come to her senses? She will. The hospital said it's the first shock. It'll pass. Mom promised to help until that. Thanks. How did mom take it? As usual. Yelled at first, then started to arrange things. At least she has her grandchild now. Gives me 3 break for abit. Go to the back seat. I'm not sure Liisu will like your big news. Hi. - Hello. Like two bundles of misery. Hey, what is it? Babies are born all the time. To everyone else. So.. Little cutie. Shall we take a bath? Check that it's not too hot. - Then give me a thermometer. You don't need a thermometer. Add some cold water. Take this bucket away. And close the door, the baby is cold. The mobile phone you called is either switched off or currently unavailable. He just doesn't get it... I told you, it's the gas. Give her tome. It'll pass in a minute... Have some more, tomorrow it all be spoilt. That's enough... So, boys, let's raise a glass to your mother. Without her, we are like soldiers without a general. Cheers. - Happy birthday. Here you go. Give her to me and take some cake. - I'll be okay. See, you are really good at this. Here you go. - Don't start. Why? Can't you see it? No coffee? Don't you think it's time you start making your own coffee? Or to learn making this. How long do we have to live and wait like this? Wait for what? Moonika, of course. How long do you think her depression will last? Something has to change. I can't go on like this. Something has to change. I can't go on like this. I'm exhausted. Do you think I'm not? Maybe Liisu can help sometimes. What are you arranging here? Sven and Liisu's cute family is good, but I'm not? - That's not what I meant. Alright then, I'll pack this diaper warehouse up. Here we go again. The drinking is making you angry. We want to help. - Find another way to help. Mai is my child. - Then behave accordingly. Go have a look! So you got what you wanted. - What did I get? I didn't get to say a word. Listen... Give us a call sometimes. - Yeah. I can't give it away for free. Running costs and everything else... It's Jaana's grandmother's inheritance. Previous tenants just split. Along with four month's rent and a kettle. No contract needed, just leave the rent in the mailbox every month on the 5th. If something breaks or leaks or co-op acts up, you'll have to deal with it. Okay, I'm off. Hi. - You ordered a pizza. Put it on a kitchen stool. Money and discount coupon are there, too. Why are you whining all the time? Shut up! Do you hear me? Shut up! Why are you whining all the time? Shut up! I'm fucking doing nothing but feeding and cleaning you! Shut up! We were wondering with the guys where'd you disappear. How much do I owe you? 1200. You'll get 700 right now. And the rest next week. My wife's friend wants something little to be done. I can't be bothered myself, everyone else is in Finland. I don't know what she wants done, but she promised 5â‚¬ an hour. I don't have any tools. - I'll lend you some stuff. You break it, you buy it. Look at you! Daddy's genes are clear to see! Tall as a super model. Get her dressed. Mai is doing very well, see, growing curve is perfectly normal. Good job. And how are you sleeping? I don't think she's sleeping at all. - Some 2.5-3 hours at atime? Then it's okay. Babies sleep like that. For how long? - The first year is tough. But it'll get better. May I ask a personal question? You are raising Mai alone, right? So what? Bringing up a child alone is a tough job. How are you doing? Normally. I think you can be proud of yourself. Hello. - Hello. Sorry, .. I couldn't find a babysitter so quickly. But she's quiet. We're going to measure today, anyway. - Iquess. Come in. Let me introduce you. This is Otto. And what's your name? - Erik. And the baby's? Mai. Good. I'm Katrin. I'd like some walls to be painted. It was planned all along, but... Still not painted. And I have chosen a wicked wallpaper for the nursery. And furniture is still packed up, and the baseboards.. And wall sockets. Get yourself a mug from there. Milk's in the fridge and sugar in front of your nose. I guess it's be better if someone else will do it. I have no place for Mai. Hold on. What? Can! help? Hey, careful! Why isn't Mai with her mother? Sorry if I'm prying. - She's abroad. Working? Well, we can wait a bit with our renovation. If it's ok with you, I'd like to finish it. - Ok with me. I mean, the more the merrier. Right? Who's leading at the Swinging Olympics? Our own champion Moppy! Very good. Alittle bit faster. Very good! Keep her in the water. And go! 3,2,1,and dive! 2,3. Quiet! Quiet! I don't want to go through putting them to sleep again. Well, 2 nursing mother. Drinking wine and sleeping around. - Hey! You're no better yourself. As soon as your wife's away... She's not really away. It's actually just Mai and me. Like... All the time? Thank you. Really. For what? Right, I'll pay for everything tomorrow, okay? I won't take any money from you. Listen, how about a decent job? I just got a good project. Somewhere near Hanko. Demolishing of a moldy school building. A goldmine. I need some men over there. Your wife'll take care of the baby, and you make good money. I'll think about it. Hey, can you lend me some money? Asking for an advance already? 100 will do. I need to pay some bills. Hello. I'm calling about your ad. Yeah... Interior finishing is 7 euros per hour. Yeah... Go fuck yourself, greedy bastard. Are you out of your mind? I was thinking... I need money. I can't live here at your expense. What's wrong with it? We can manage. I don't like it like this. Think it over. Do you think it's my dream to raise someone else's child? While you're working somewhere abroad. - It's just a couple of months. Mai is used to you. And she can stay at my mother's for some time. - Fuck you, really! So you were just looking for a babysitter, not a wife. Good deal for you? Desperate single mother never refuses a mercy fuck. I haven't gone anywhere yet! - I know how it goes. First, it's two months, then two years, then I won't see you at all! I'm sorry. Answer my calls. I miss y.. A friend recommended not to let it be thrown away. And now, I cut myself a slice every morning and evening. Then eat it while it's still frozen. Does it help? It's like cannibalism. Doesn't it make you sick? - No. It's just meat. But can you eat someone else's placenta? But can you eat someone else's placenta? No! Only your own will relieve depression. Bye then. - Bye. Well.. What is it? We should.. I hope you'll become a millionaire in your precious Finland. Do you have a girlfriend? Jaana found out somehow. She saw some stupid texts and now everything is fucked. Doesn't let me come near her. You're lucky. Strolling with Mai, chicks hitting on you like mad. They're not. Just look at those melons! Makes your mouth water, right? It's Friday night. Mails sleeping? Will she sleep long? Until five. So what's the problem? By the time she wakes up, you'll be back without anyone knowing. Let's go! You can't sulk here all the time. The ticket's on me. And taxi. No one will find out! Four shots of vodka. What'd you take? - Vodka. This is for lovel Taxi, please. I can't see any street names. One moment. What? Fucking hell. Where is she? Emergency Centre. What's the emergency? Where's Mai? Where were you? Where's Mai? Fucking... Were you thinking at all? Leaving a child home alone! Are you crazy? You want to go to jail? Shit! Just look at the mess you have here! - I just had to get out... Fucking hobo hole! I can't all the time... - You can't what? Give me a hug! Such a strong hug! Give Daddy 2 Kiss, too. And up! Now run, run! Lean your head back. What? What are you saying? We wash the fish after. - Yes, we'll wash the fish, too. We started to explain him, what water is. Pippa said it's the stuff you drink. I added that you can also swim in the water. And father mentioned that water is inevitable for brushing your teeth. Well, congratulations. How are you doing? Quite good. I'd offer you some coffee, but... But I'm a little busy right now. Let's talk some other time. Daddy, who's that auntie? Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Mai, happy birthday to you! Blow the candles out. This is a slide! - No, itisn't. Then what is it? Shall .. - Mai, let's go together! Who'll inflate it? Who'll inflate the crocodile? - Mel Whocando it? What's wrong? Nothing. 1,2,3.. And we score! Hello. Please be seated. Applicant Moonika Almgren. Please explain your application to the court. Why do you want to apply for shared custody now, when Mai Metsur is three years old. Do you have a reason to believe that her father can not do the job? No need to stand up, it's not an interrogation. Three years ago, when Mai was born... - Please speak louder. When Mai was born, I was all alone. Ididn't have a job and I hadn't graduated from school. I had to get my life in order. And it's in order now? Yes, I think so. Do I understand correctly that you currently live in Sweden. Yes. Near Stockholm. My husband has a house there. And his business is there, too. I'm helping him with bookkeeping. So you have a family business? - No, I... I'm an employee, but I receive official salary. I'm an employee, but I receive official salary. Does the person concerned, Erik Metsur, maintains his objections. Yes. - On what grounds do you object? Fm.. Mai has been... We have lived together with Mai. Three years. The two of us. I don't understand what I have to explain. - Let me elaborate. The father has every right to doubt the applicant's motive, as she has not once in three years visited her child. Have you hidden your place of living? Is your financial state stable enough? How do you respond to claims of alcohol abuse and domestic violence. What does Child Welfare say? - According to the law, the mother has a right and obligation to see her child. Allowing shared custody for the mother is premature. I would recommend setting fixed meeting times. At least until the end of the proceedings. So, it went well. I guess. They don't have any evidence. You're okay? What does the meeting arrangement mean? Moonika will get afixed schedule, when, for how long, where, and who has to be present during the meeting. That concerns both of you. She has to show up and you can not obstruct. Preliminary judgmentis due in, say, three weeks. Maybe a month. So let's take it easy, right. Oh, hi! Take it. - I don't want to. Why? - I don't want these ducks. But they are your favourites. Only this one is my favourite. These are clean. Eat. Is it too hot? It isn't. It's not hot. - I took some of that. You did? Eat. - Ill getit. Hello. Hello. Please turn the volume down. I think you better... - I'll go in a minute. Maybe we can reach another agreement? How on earth? You'll leave your Swede? Move back to this shitty Estonia and become a mother to your daughter? I thought so. I don't get how all of a sudden you miss her. Young woman, make some new babies and bring them up. Mai is not your child anymore. Don't you understand? It was just a bad dream. Don't cry anymore. Daddy's right here. Hello. - Morning. Can you talk? Alittle bit. We should meet. - Who's that? Can you come to my office? Like, right now. Statement of claim for contesting paternity Sorry for the direct question, but is she just bluffing? Okay. Right. I see. We can claim the paternity test request is expired. Can... Can I refuse to take it? - No. Unless the court will find the request overdue. Otherwise, DNA test is compulsory. What if it tums out that... That I'm not... Then we can't do anything. Estonian law gives no rights to a person who's not a biological parent. No obligations, either. Wait for me here. I'll be right back. Imbi. You must help me now. - You know I can't. You can. Yes, you can. You have to. You know, this whole thing... You do know what sort of a snake you have raised, right? - Don't! She's actually a good girl. It's all my fault. I was the one who told her to call you. So you found a bona fide fool, right? - Lthought... I thought you'd make up. Do you know how much Moonika has been mocked for that? That girl... The fatherless girl... Small town, you know how it is. But Mai has a father! - Mai has a mother, too. But Mai has a father! - Mai has a mother, too. Mai is so much like Moonika. And I thought she's like me. Wait, I'll take another one. Moppy, come. Let's see what the doctor says. Come on. It doesn't hurt. Just a bit ticklish. Open your mouth now. Good girl. Well, hello, wonder guy. Hey, man. What's up? Haven't heard from you for ages. Are you back in Finland? How are you doing? Doing well. Doing friggin' well, seriously. It's sunny every day. And food is cheap. And women are happy. So I'm beyond happy. Wait... But tell me about yourself. Listen... Would you find a job for me there? Urgently. You yourself? I think I can find something. What's going on there? The final is next week. Sven said he'll come, too. Hey dad.. What is it? Nothing. I'll tell you later. Do you want a shot? You know what? Don't take this Moonika business too seriously. We discussed it with Mom. No law is set in stone. You'll figure it out. We'll support you. - Grandpa! From Tallinn, Estonia to Sydney, Australia. One way. Grandpa! Catch! Moppy! Come on, let's go. We'll come back some other day. Well.. Daddy's going alone then. So feed her from time to time and... I'll call you in a couple of days. Bye! Take Rapunzel, too. Here, on the sofa. Oh, Hippo, too? Okay, let's go.
