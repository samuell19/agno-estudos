A DAIEI PRODUCTION December 1957, Mt. Amagi. The Wandering Princess Directed by: Kinuyo Tanaka Ryuko's not back yet? Not yet, m'lady. My call confirmed that the princess had already departed, ma'am. What's keeping her? She knows it's Kabuki tonight. Kazuko, is it ready? Yes. Something about Ryuko? Mother, did you tell Ryuko about tonight? Not I. But have you mentioned the betrothal? Her suitor is very eager. It's his invitation so we should attend. You must hear her feelings on the matter. -It's extremely important. -Yes. M'lady. The General is here to see you. General Asabuki? Ryuko? Ryuko? Here, Grandmother. Hello. I did knock. -The most wonderful thing, Mater! -Yes dear? I had a premonition. So I rushed to Professor Kinoshita's. He wants me to do oils! He's accepted me as a pupil. It's marvelous! It surely is. A perfect premonition. I bought a gown. All the artists wear them. I couldn't wait to get mine. What on earth is that? But it does suit you. He's absolutely the best artist. Such a wonderful gentleman. Don't forget, it was my introduction. And you're wonderful too! Thank you, dear. I shall be an artist. And I'll exhibit in the spring. And win! It's wonderful to have dreams when you're young. I'll have them for my whole life! Mother's always on about marriage. It's too soon. Your parents don't agree. And you, mater? Whatever makes you happy. You are wonderful. Oh, look at the time! Hurry, lest you be late. Mother! Sorry I kept you. Dear, something serious has arisen. We must talk. The General visited earlier. For what purpose? An issue of importance. In the matter of the betrothal of our Ryuko to the brother of the Emperor of Manchuria. Lt. General Furuya journeyed from Army HQ in Manchuria to set the schedule. -Whose betrothal? -Ryuko's. To whom? The younger brother of the Manchurian Emperor. Our Ryuko?! They're far too arrogant. It's ridiculous! But we'd better agree to a meeting. The military is very powerful. We're not cowed by the military. My granddaughter's not to be bandied about. Mother, I daresay it's cause to celebrate. That a Japanese be wed to the Manchurian throne, is a matter of joy to both empires, isn't it? General Asabuki was the military governor of Manchuria, and the army in Manchuria are pushing the marriage. They've become extremely powerful, and have influence over the entire military. Heaven forbid they're so dominant. But the recent coup attempt confirms it. I'd refuse to meet him. Pray, who's in command of the military? I'll go see the Minister of the Army! Mother. The Minister's not in charge. -Then whom? -The army. No individual? Exactly. That's where the power is. We're bloodline to Emperor Meiji, how could it come to this? I wish I were a commoner. Am I to be cast off, and you sent away to marry a Manchurian, under military orders? Couldn't wait, eh? -Be seated. -Yes. I usually travel by airplane. I'm not used to cramped Japanese trains. You should see the size of them in Manchuria! Exactly. I planned to meet you in Kyoto, but I had urgent orders. I see. You gained an assent from the Hosokawa girl? As expected, they refused. That's insolence! No, it's natural. The Emperor himself prefers his brother marries into the Ch'ing dynasty. That's why it's essential that the army take a leading role in making sure, that we form a bond between the two countries. What's wrong with General Aki's daughter? I've no wish to further inflame the power stuggle in the ranks. Think of the consequences of a military girl. It must be a girl from the court. Time is of the essence. And it's my decision. The military can purge you anytime. Military? Define military! Is it you fascist upstarts who are, trying to force my hand? You're simply impatient with my centrist views. I want what's best for Prince Futetsu. From among all the photographs, he himself chose Princess Ryuko. And you running off to Hosokawa in Kyoto, was an extremely stupid, impudent move. My duties are to oversee the Manchurian royal family, and this is one of my tasks. Allow me. His Imperial Highness, Prince Futetsu. General and Mrs. Asabuki, who need no introduction, serving as go-betweens. I am Lieutenant General Furuya. Today's meeting ranks as a state secret, hence the suddenness of it all. To avoid any counter reaction, I must ask you to keep it secret. Her grandmother. We're honored, your Majesty. The princess Ryuko. The thing is... I'd heard and dismissed reports of your opulence until I slipped on the marble in your entrance! It did no damage, but knocked me down a peg or two! Money as such means nothing to me, but the truly wealthy live like this, eh? The princess dables in painting and calligraphy. The Prince left Manchuria, and graduated from our Military Academy. He's currently training as an officer in Chiba, so he's fluent in Japanese. He tells a good joke, too. I'd like to say that, the Prince is agreeable to the match, and we await the Princess' response. In my own opinion, Ryuko should, have the perogative of making the decision. Please. He seems like a fine young man. He's as gentle as a spring breeze. Not much of a talker but gentlemanly enough to put us to shame. I've asked around his classmates, and he enjoys a good reputation. I thought so too, when I met him. He graduated in the top of his class, so he's intelligent, too. And very fair to the lower ranks. No matter he's not Japanese. I really think you couldn't make a better match, Ryuko. You needn't stand on ceremony. You're free to reject the proposal. Ryuko, forget all about the politics, and ask yourself if you want to become his bride. I bow to your wishes. Manchurian Prince Futetsu engaged to Princess Ryuko Army announces royal wedding on April 3rd Congratulations. Her Majesty awaits. Please. Ryuko Sugawara, Ma'am. I'm honored, Your Majesty. May your good health continue, Majesty. Enter. Approach. Be seated. Congratulations. You are beautiful. Not often do we see such youthful dress. Hence the stipulation of our invitation. The hair is not too heavy? No. Your family is well, we hope? Yes. They enjoy your blessings. How long has it been? The Marquis brought you, when you were but a little girl. You ran through the palace, fell down and wept bitterly. We picked you up but alas, you still cried. It was your father, wasn't it? When I heard of you going to Manchuria, I was so pleased. Faithfully serving their Emperor, is a form of service to our Emperor. Let not homesickness afflict you. Show them the virtue of Japanese maidens. As you say, Your Majesty, I shall strive to do my best. I received this as a gift from, the late Emperor Meiji's mother. It's fitting that it should pass to you. When you're lonely in distant Manchuria, remember us and gain strength from it. Approach. These seed of styrax obassia, I gathered them myself. Plant them in your new land. A gift from the Emperor. I have the honor of conveying it. It is beautiful. A magnificent dress. It's Chinese, isn't it? By custom, a Chinese bride wears red the first year. Wedding Invitation The Emperor gives congratulatory speech at Royal Wedding Beautiful bride off for honeymoon in Manchuria Your brother, Sire. Work hard at your marriage. Thank you, Sire. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, they finally installed a telephone. I'm so pleased. That's good. Something else is bound to arise. They said the residence was outstanding, but it's like a barracks! It's no place for a princess. It's unfinished and doesn't even have an automobile. How inconvenient. The Prime Minister asked the army for a vehicle. Not for a Manchurian sub-lieutenant, they said. He's the Emperor's brother! They must consider his rank. I heard that the Manchurian constitution, allows for no royalty other than the Emperor. -Is that true? -Yes. But they never complain. How trying. Come in. -It's time to depart, Sire. - Alright. And Ryuko? She's in the living room. The phone is connected. Come see. Let's call someone. Are you alright? Last night as I slept, I heard a far off train. The days are so quiet. It's so isolated. Homesick? Come here. When summer comes, we'll see wild rabbits frolicking here. It was a mongolian farm. And here is where we'll build the new capital. The palace will be right there. A total of 250 square kilometers. It will soon fill with people. With the palace just across the road. I did so enjoy my stay in Japan. I'd still be there if I hadn't graduated. I shouldn't. I'm just making you homesick. I couldn't bear it if you left. I'd never leave you. Thank you. Let's buy that land next door, and plant apricots. -Do you know the flower? -No. Similar to cherry blossoms. But not as exquisite. Closer to plum blossoms. There's a forest of them in Beijing. In spring they bloom a delicate pink. Yes, we'll plant apricots. Why do the Japanese try, to plot a dynastic clash twixt my brother and I? You exaggerate, Majesty. His wife is Japanese. Forget you're my Prime Minister, and tell me what you, yourself, think. My opinion doesn't matter. But China and Manchuria are one, and we're Chinese. What the Japanese army dictates, matters not a whit. I am merely the Prime Minister of Manchuria. And I'm the Emperor of Manchuria. A beautiful scent. Ryuko, have they sprouted yet? I hear that Her Majesty personally, gathered the seeds for you to plant here. My grandmother wrote me, that she's still tending the shoots. Have her send them as soon as they sprout. We'll raise them as we will our child. They have flowers like white clouds. Awake Eisei? It's Daddy. Say Daddy. You'll have to wait. Silly Daddy. Can you see? The apricots are beautiful. Just wait till next year! Ryuko. The Emperor wants to see her. He's tired of just seeing photographs. You should take her. Don't you want to go? From the first time that I met him, he's treated me as if I were a stranger. That's because he's shy. He's had a hard life. I'll take her. Madame. Madame. We're short again this month. I've asked him to cut down. He agrees, but then, he gives so much away. He has no conception of money. Aren't you the same, ma'am? But I'm a woman! Don't all wives suffer so? Since Furuya was promoted, he's done everything to thwart us. He never visits anymore. Yours? She's cute. She's Manchurian, like you. No, you're Japanese. You speak funny. Yes, I'm Japanese. But I married a Manchurian, so I am too. Is it true that, our Emperor is brother to the Japanese Emperor? Not at all. He was the Emperor of China, but the Ch'ing dynasty ended, and he became Manchuria's Emperor. He can't speak a word of Japanese. How do you know that? He's my baby's uncle. -Really? -Absolutely. Japs killed two Manchurians last night. You should be careful. My dad gets mad when Japanese eat, at our restaurant but don't pay. -Greetings, Futetsu. -Long may you reign. Don't be so formal. Haven't seen you for a while. Sit down. Your majesty is aware that, I've been absent for a year. Eisei has started talking. Talking already? It seems you've really fallen for the lass. Are you jealous of my baby? I've no conception of a family life. If it pleases Your Majesty, I shall bring them both occasionally. Have the Kempetai kept you away? I'm not afraid of them. The Japanese secret police have no right, to keep brother's apart. Why don't you lodge a complaint with the Japanese military? Futetsu, your wife is Japanese. Your standing with them is different to mine. In 1941, Japan struck at Pearl Harbor The Japanese Emperor's brother visited Manchuria What are you doing here? You're supposed to be with the lower ranks! Present arms! Our mother holds you in fond regard. You form a bridge between our two empires. Mummy! Yes, dear? What's that? I'm painting. Pretty, isn't it? Yes. My happiest days were studying art. I could forget my loneliness. Are you lonely? You have me. I'm not lonely any more. Show me your dance. One, two... Do you know what we're celebrating? Memorial Day. We have so many festivals. I know many. 10,000 Years and then New and Old Years, Dowager Empress' Day. Fifth Month Festival. You've done well. You're very good. Thank you, Majesty. Clever little girl. We bask in your praise, Your Majesty. -Sit down. -Thank you. I long thought you were a spy, with the mission of deposing me. A tool of the Japanese army. I, sir? I can't trust anyone. A spy? Here? Unfortunately so. Especially today, when all the clan is gathered. I'm so sad to hear it, Sire. I am Futetsu's wife, my heart and soul belong to China. I see how they have tormented you, too. Futetsu never mentioned it. I have wronged you, forgive me. Tell me if you need money. You have a child. The Empress is tormented by barrenness. You noted her conduct at the banquet. She's so beautiful, the Empress. A beautiful doll. Rumor has it that the Americans will soon invade. Panic reigns - schools are closed. It's rumored the Emperor is in the mountains, ready to fight to the death. The army's requisitioned all bottles, to use as fire-bombs against the invaders when they land. We're short of weapons. There's no food. This may be my last letter. I pray it gets through. Sorry, I didn't see you come in. My mother writes that Japan is having it hard. What are you doing? The Emperor has donated his treasures to the army. I shall do the same. These I got from the Empress. From my family. It's hard to part with them. But the country needs them. Japan and Manchuria are as one. Manchuria must do its utmost. Even my stiped is questioned. They are too much, the army. They're interfering in family matters. They forbade me to pay respects to my father. My brother put his foot down. They tried to stop him worshipping our ancestors. They have no respect for our religion nor customs. Be patient, dear. They say perseverance will bring victory. Their gestapo arrested a minister for suggesting, we'd be completely dominated should the Japanese win. They nearly killed him. No wonder so many flee to Beijing. They've plundered our coal, while the people freeze. Yes, we too suffered last winter. Because I'm not Japanese. How can I help? Tell me what I can do. All I hear makes me so sad. There's nothing I can do. I didn't mean to hurt you. Forgive me. There are good Japanese. Many came to build Manchuria, but left in disgust. I hear Japan's suffering shortages, too. Don't speak of Japan, it saddens me. Yes? Daddy! Daddy! Come and play. Daddy's busy. Go and play with Mummy. Mummy! -Mummy! -Yes, dear? We'll play with Lilly. Lilly! Lilly! Lilly! Lilly! Lilly, here girl. We'll go to the cellar. Tokyo, July 20. A fleet of carrier-borne bombers, made repeated attacks on Tokyo. Over 800 planes were counted. The golden sun sets slowly in the west The bell of an ancient temple chimes Let's join hands and return to our homes Like the crows themselves do Mummy! Still awake? I tucked you in earlier. Daddy woke me up! Really? Naughty Daddy. She was having a nightmare. I wasn't frightened! Not with Mummy and Daddy here. I'm truly happy. I'm a courier from Army HQ. The palace was not hit last night. The Emperor is unharmed. Good man. The Soviets declared war. I've just come from a cabinet meeting. The Emperor's transferring the capital. The entire government? They realize that by doing so, the people will lose faith in the government. The capital is extremely vulnerable. The Japanese Army have long held, that they can defend the new location. I see. The consul's wife told me earlier on the phone. Consul? He was at HQ today. She's the only wife still remaining. She asked me to fly to Tokyo with them. And? Dear? Will you go? Where to? I am of your family. I've nowhere to be but by your side. August 1945, Japanese Army retreats south I see you're not ready to evacuate, but the Russians are pouring across the border. They could be here tomorrow. The army's taken to the hills for a last stand, but I can't see them lasting two months. Two months? You said you had a million troops, and could last for 5-10 years! I don't know the details. We had a treaty with the Russians. Their move took us off guard. Most troops were transferred south, and we only have 300,000 left in Manchuria. Darling. Ryuko, go with the Emperor. I'll fight to the finish here. Your commission is invalid. The order came today. This is your work! I will not betray my people as you have! It was a direct order of the Emperor. I shall serve him to the end. It's easy to go to your death. But to abandon your Emperor! He needs you. You're the only one who can protect him. It's not a betrayal to evacuate! The Empress! Please forgive me. We know not what fate awaits us. August 14, 1945 The capital was transferred Manchurian Court ...marks the end of the Emperor's announcement. Let his words reside in 100 million hearts. He spoke to ease the suffering, and the chaos of his loyal subjects. There is but one road left to us. I know you weep for the country and myself. But this is all that remains to me. Our empire has faced much opposition, in the 13 years and 5 months of its existence. And now it has come to an end. I am abdicating. The Prime Minister and other cabinet members are released from their duties. Together we can overcome this anguish. The Japanese Emperor has endured worse. You've stood by me through all the hardships. You too, dear. Now we can live simply in Tokyo. It pains me to ask this of you. Would you take care of the Empress? I shall protect her with my life. Thank you. Take care, Sire. Be a good girl. Farewell, Daddy. After the Emperor abdicated, the remaining retinue fled to the mountains, to escape the guerrilla bands. We waited anxiously for orders, to follow you by airplane. But then we heard that the Emperor's plane, had been captured by the Soviets. The Empress fell ill and we were all at a loss. Remember how Eisei said farewell to you? I never dreamt it was to be so final. Any Japs here?! Get the Japs! It was their new year festival. The people were celebrating. But we, under house arrest, watched in a kind of desperation. Get up! Who's that? That's my mummy! That's daddy! And me! That's mine. -Have it. -Thank you. That night, gunfire heralded the start of a nightmare. Who are you? Japanese troops. The Empress is here. We're here to rescue you. Help! Help! Guard. Guard. Guard. Let me go to the Empress. Please, I can quieten her down. She's upsetting everyone. Pull yourself together. Help me! Help me! She needs opium. I'll sell my things for the money. Tell the warden. She'll die without it. Once you freed us. Why are we under arrest again? At least buy medicine. Bring me my jewels! Can't you see she's ill? Is my bath not ready?! Bring me my gown! Eat this. Thank you. Get ready to leave. Only bring necessities. What about the Empress? If she stays, I shall too. Don't worry about the Empress. Your Highness! Your Highness! Stop that! Let me stay with her. No, get over there. But she's ill. Forget about the Empress. Get back with the others. Your Highness! Your Highness! The Red Army took us along as they fled north, then suddenly released us at a small village. Penniless, malnourished, racked with dysentery, we trudged through what seemed the length of China. One year and five months after our farewell, we finally reached Japan. Look! Over there! Land! That's Japan! You can see land! It's true! It's true! Thank god! You can see it! Eisei. Wake up. Eisei. In spite of our hardships, Eisei flourished. Mater had passed away. The residence survived. Father and mother did their best to comfort us. Ah, the smell of violets. The violet is a pretty flower. Where, oh, where are they hiding? The violet is a pretty flower. Eisei has picked up the language well. She studies hard and has blossomed beautifully. We've shed memories of prisons and hardships. I wonder where you are. Are you still alive? I ask every refugee if they have seen you. But no one knows. Eisei boldly wrote to Chou En Lai about you. Ah, you're safe! Both you and the Emperor! I heard that you've been imprisoned. One thought dwells heavily on my mind. Why do Japan and China have to fight all the time? I know nothing of politics. But I don't doubt both peoples can live in friendship. Can we be a small bridge between them? To this I shall devote the rest of my life. I thought to bring Eisei up as a Japanese. But the Chinese has slowly seeped in. She has an interest in Chinese history and culture. I've tried to help her see with a Chinese heart, so that a war such as that shall never happen again. But I was careless. I made a dreadful mistake. Eisei is dead. No matter for what reason, she took her life. I was wrong for not perceiving her pain. Ah, the smell of violets The violet is a pretty flower Where, oh, where are they hiding? The violet is a pretty flower Eisei was the last of the Ch'ing dynasty. This weighed heavily on her young self. I augur she just wanted peace. We went through so much together. How could I not know how she felt? The seeds we planted grew with her. They are big now and in bloom. But Eisei is no more. Please forgive me, dear. Pity me who has gone from spring to a bitter winter. Don't blame yourself. Her death is a suffering we share. It's not your fault. Perhaps my absence was the reason. The greater sorrow that I bear is that, I cannot hold you in my arms and comfort you. High mountains and a deep sea stand between us. But I believe, one day we shall be together again. And I know, that you shall be a bridge between our two lands. All springs turn to winter. There is warmth in even the darkest winter. Press a flower for Eisei and send it to me. I shall treasure it. We couldn't be together as a family, but have faith that one day we shall be together again. As Eisei would wish us to. THE END
