So, we're really doing this, huh? Right now? - Yup. Okay, we got to present this properly. Where should I go? - Come to the right. To the right? - Come on. To the right? - Come on. Okay? Hi, my name is... Hi. My name is David Raskin... ...and I'm applying for the MIT Physics Fellowship. What I've developed is an intelligent propulsion experiment... ...which allows me to... I think I'm getting into that too early. I should talk about them more, right? I first became interested in the sciences... No, that was not the way to start. What if I walk at you like... - Can you just go? All right, watch. Hi. My name is David Raskin. Take it down, like, four notches, Seacrest. What? - Come on. I'd like to introduce you to my engineers, Adam Le and Quinn Goldberg, and it's my sister, Christina Raskin, behind the camera. Would you not... Hold on one second. I'll hold it so you can point... Dude, you're distracting him. What if it looks like you built it? - Close your eyes. No, it's not gonna look like I built it. All right. Like that? Let's put this up, Chris. Okay, the smartphone's connected to the Wi-Fi. Ready. Wait, wait, wait. Beginning to lift the craft. Take the controller. I want you to notice these marks on my fingers. All right, cutting off power now. Dude, you're getting into MIT. These marks on my hand are read... ...by the modified motion sensor on the computer. It allows my hands to manipulate this craft... ...with uncanny precision. That's nuts. The motion sensors are routed through my smart phone... ...with an 802.11g, 64 gigahertz wireless. Chris, watch out. Coming your way. Ta-da. - Yes. All right, let's take this thing to its max altitude. Come on, let's go. Oh, shit. - Grab the computer. Go, go, go. Okay, so, unlike other static systems, my algorithm tracks gestures while the operator is moving. Elevation, 140.151, David. 170. It should have a vertical reach of about 250 feet. What is that? Is that my phone? David, I think I lost signal. What do you mean you lost signal? The calls interrupting the Wi-Fi. Who could possibly be calling you right now? Everyone you know is standing right here. It's not connecting, David. Guys, it's not responding. It's not responding. I don't see it anymore. It's gone. It's dropping. Guys, run. - Which way do I go? Which way? - Go. Quinn, run. Oh, shit. The experiment was a complete success. Thank you for your consideration, MIT. Christina, I need you to put that laundry away. Yes. I will do it later, I promise. David's daily ritual. Checking for the letter, day 37. Quinn. Yeah, it came. No, I don't know if I got in yet, but it's really... It's big. All right, well, come over then. Come on. Go show her. David, go show her. Christina, I need you to put that laundry away. Yeah, I will. And I'm not gonna tell you again. Good. Can you see this stain here? - No, Mom... I got two job interviews today. Mom, look, look. It came. Oh, my God. Christina, give me that. It's a family moment. Wait for me, wait for me. I'm growing a beard, David. Open it. Shut up. - Christina, be more supportive. Okay, I want you to listen. I want you to know whatever happens... Oh, my God. David... - Shut up. You shut up. 'On behalf of the admissions committee, 'we're delighted to inform you... 'that you have been admitted to the MIT class of 2018.' Congratulations. - Yay. Yo, Adam, she didn't get into anything. We're celebrating, right? You know, your father would be so proud of you. Dude. David? What's the matter? 'We've reviewed your request... 'and we're pleased to award you $5,000 in financial aid.' What? Wait. What about the other $40,000? Mom, how are you gonna afford that? Look, dude, let me see that. - Please, turn that off. God, dude, look at those. Perfect little tree trunks. Those legs are like... Good job, David. Sorry to hear about MIT. - Yes, sir. I also didn't get a scholarship to MIT, Dr. Lou. Also didn't sprout wings and fly. Still a few scholarships left, David. I'll look into those, sir. Thank you. Yo, just pretend it's not me. If you could say one thing to MIT, what would it be? This is stupid. Wrong answer, dude. You know what? Maybe you don't want to go. - I do wanna go. Dude, I think these nuggets were frozen before Obama was elected. David, prove it. Prove that you wanna go. How am I gonna prove that I wanna go to MIT? How about for a free ride, every day, your mom shows up... ...and publicly hands you your fungal medication? Only if your mom does the application. You know what I mean? Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah. What if MIT was like, 'Go up to Sarah Nathan and just start making out with her.' Why would MIT want me to make out with people? Because MIT believes in bold risk takers. I take risks. I'm a risk taker. Yeah. Name one risk you took. Right now. - Exactly. That's not... That's too big. This is what I'm saying, dude, if I had your brain and bone structure, I would be unstoppable. I mean, aren't you sick of having sex with your hand? What? - I'm sorry. He sniffs Sharpies. You drug addict. You totally are stupid, dude. Hey, look. Hey, hey, dude, check this out. Bam. Hey, that's cool. - Right? Well, you see, that's my problem. I can't get the Uls to interact. You got to put the L2 cache in ad hoc mode. Obviously... What are you doing? Oh, my God, Jessie Pierce. Dude, I would literally give away all my earthly possessions... ...for one date with her. What, are you gonna give her your Xbox and a coupon at Chipotle? Will you please get in the car? Bye, guys, see you later. Chris, come on. - Coming. Look at the bright side, David, you're gonna have so much free time now. Hey, Jessie, what are you doing tonight? David wants to take you out. - You're such an idiot. Dude, I'm hooking you up. - Shut up, Quinn. Yo, keep it up, ladies. You know, you wouldn't... David, what the shit, man? Why do you drive this car? - So embarrassing. This is the best part of my day. One day, this car is going to kill us. Don't let them see me. Yo, relax. It's a classic. C'mon. Just move that piece of shit. I think it's my starter relay. Give me that Leatherman, please. Well, actually, I believe it's the fuselage valve, but what do I know? You're confusing my car with an airplane, but... David, you got this? Yeah, no, I got it. Please tell me you got it working. Come on, come on, come on. Dude, if you want a permanent fix, just let me know. I'll take a look at your car. Sure, you're gonna fix my car? What the hell is that? Oh, shit. Oh, my God. David? This doesn't make any sense. Mom, goddang. The house will pay for MIT, and Aunt Chloe says your sister and I can move into her apartment. I can't let you sell this house, Mom. There's got to be something that I can do. I can get a job. It's too late for that, David. You tried to get a scholarship. It didn't work. Well, none of this would have happened if... David. Come on. I'm sorry. I miss your father, too. But he would have wanted this. You're just as smart as him, you know. I'm not gonna let that go to waste. Okay. It is what it is, David. There's nothing you can do about it now. What are you, sulking? God. You scared the shit out of me. I'm not sulking. Dude, you should be happy. You're getting what you wanted. I'm the one who's getting screwed. This isn't what I wanted, Chris. I remember this thing. I'm trying to solve this, okay? How are you solving this in the creepy attic? It's dumb. You know, there's this one last scholarship... ...where I have to submit a proposal for an experiment... ...and I thought maybe if I got it, Mom wouldn't have to sell the house. Dad must have a million ideas lying around up here. I don't know, Chris. I mean, I thought there'd be something up here. I can't find anything I can use. Hey, what is this? When did we get a video camera? That's Dad's old camera, yeah. Remember that? Yeah. Hey, look, it still works. Really? - Wow. Yeah. Let me see. - Check it out. That's my seventh birthday. I guess it makes sense that's the last thing... ...he would have filmed, right. - Fuck. Quinn, I'm telling you, I'm looking at it right now. You were a chubby kid. Come here. No, I mean, it's weird to hear his voice... ...for the first time, like, after all these years. Are you getting this? - Light the last three. What was that? - Here we go. Hold on a sec. Nothing, I just saw something weird in the mirror. Are you getting this? - Light the last three. Holy shit. Quinn, I got to go. Chris. Chris, come down here. I don't... I don't understand. It just is. I got to show Quinn and Adam. There's this footage of me at my seventh birthday. I mean, I was at my seventh birthday. We were all at your seventh birthday. No shit. No, I know, I know. Here. Just... You don't understand. Just watch this. I still think it's just a glitch in the camera. So right... Wow. - Right as this lady walks by. Oh, my God, I remember this. - No, no, no. Right as this lady walks by, look in the mirror... Right there, right there. Did you guys just see that? Dude, I was so frickin' cute. Dude, I was cute. Adam fell off that frigging bike... ...and it was the funniest thing I'd ever seen. Am I... Do I exist in the world? Are you guys even seeing me right now? Please, look at this. Dude, you're crazy. Ready, go. Play. I'm ready, I'm ready. Right there. In the mirror. Look in the mirror. Holy shit. - Holy shit. Dude, is that... That can't be. That's me. David, you are just seeing what you want to see. Maybe, I don't know, someone could have photoshopped it. Nobody's messed with it. It's been in my attic for 10 years. Look, it's obviously like a relative or something, David. Family does tend to actually look alike. All right. Well, then explain this. We're wearing the same shirt. What's with the camera, Chris? Yeah, isn't it cool? It's my dad's. That bitch. What is Sarah Nathan's problem? She knows I like Justin. Chris, check this out. Lollapalooza was so sick. Lemme see? I am so jealous. God, why did I have to miss that? What is your brother doing? No offense, Christina, but that's kind of creepy. He's just watching a tape of kids. You don't know... Let me guess, you found aliens at your party, too. Okay, we're gonna be using some really big words... David, that's not you. Okay, no. This is definitely me. Maybe. - Look. That is my T-shirt, that is my backpack and that is my watch. That's me. Wait. What's the thing in your hand? The ballerina thing. What? A keychain, I think? Okay. Everybody, take out your keys. Maybe it's not you, man. Shit. Whose stuff is this in my bag? Wait, wait. This is Jessie Pierce's. What? - Are you serious? You have a hot chick bag. You're like a hot chick. This is what you need to do. Go over there... ...and pretend like you just don't care. Throw it at her and be like, 'Yo, here's your shit, Pierce.' I'm sorry. Have you seen David with girls? I'm still right here, Chris. Be nice. No. I will go give this back to her. No, no, no. I'm gonna go and take it back to her, okay. That's right. I'm not gonna let my sister do my bidding. Man. Man. Yo, let me smell your breath, though. What are you gonna say? Are you trying to communicate with me telepathically? Excuse me, I... I have... I think you have my bag. I think we switched bags. Possibly? Looks like. By the way, my name is... David? - Yeah. We've gone to school together for four years. Yeah. Did you go through my stuff? No. I might have reached in there a little bit to kinda feel around blindly, but... Is that why you're wearing my perfume? Well... I didn't spray that. That wasn't me. So other people went through my stuff, too. I'm really sorry, okay. I just came to switch bags with you. I would never have... I would never do that. David? Yeah. - Congrats on MIT. Thank you. Dude, David, you've lived here your whole life. Where are you gonna go? Quinn, come on, can you stop talking about it all the time? Guys, stop arguing for two seconds, okay. We need to figure out what I'm doing on this tape, right? So... So, I'm over here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're back there. Back there to the right. Yeah, that's good. Then somebody crosses frame. Quinn, go here. Actually, move the camera to the left a little. Okay. - And you, back to the right. That's perfect, that's perfect. Wait, wait. Split that difference. There. That's perfect. Don't move. Right here. So what am I doing? We're just standing here? You're doing mad backflips. Let me check. It looks like your right hand... ...is reaching for something. Like, maybe the wall? Okay. Wait, no, no, no. Behind the wall. Yeah. There's a light switch. What does that one turn on? The basement? Let's check. Down here. Quinn, turn the lights on. This all your dad's stuff? - Yeah. Whoa. Let's do this. Are you sure you should touch that? Help me out. We weren't allowed in here. We're going in today. Help me out. Spooky. - Quinn. Jeez. Someone's afraid of the dark. What are you, 10 years old? Did you hear that? Yeah, what was that? I don't hear it anymore. Was that the light? Quinn, keep clicking the lights on and off. I thought I heard a sound. There, there. Yeah, I hear it, too. It's like a fricking clicking noise or something. Yeah, check over there. I don't know where it's coming from. - Where's it coming from? Wait, I see something. Leave the lights on. Holy shit. No way. Goddang. Wait. Turn the lights back off. Why? - Try this. It's connected to the light switch. Oh, my God. That's the same thing your dad was holding on the tape. The case... Help me out. Come on. - Right here, right here. What the hell? Turn them on. What the hell is that? Open it. - No, you open it. You need to open it. It's your dad's. Whoa. Oh, my God. Chris, come get this. Chris, Chris, come here. I'm getting it. What? Whoa. You getting this, Chris? What's D-A-R-P-A? It's DARPA. It's a classified division of the military. They work on all kinds of crazy shit. They invented the Internet, tried teleportation. I thought your dad was in energy research. Yes, my dad worked for Eastern Power and Electric. I mean... - Is this it? Thermomagnetic accelerator navigation drive? I don't understand. This is some sort of a machine, guys. What, like a computer or something? No, not a machine. These schematics use equations like the theory of relativity. Engine pressure ratio. Course deviation indicator? Longitudinal static stability? Hydraulic interface module. Wait, here we go. Project Almanac. ID number 453-Delta-71? 'Temporal relocation prototype'? Temporal relocation? That's... That's impossible. Any time you guys want to speak English... ...so that I can follow. - Temporal relocation. What does that mean? It means time travel. I mean, that's what that means. What? Holy shit. So you're telling me Dad left a time machine in the basement? Well... I mean, I guess technically, he left blueprints, but... Still... Slow down for one second, okay. Let's just all take a beat here. DARPA designed this. So it could actually be real, right? It's possible. We should try to build it. You guys, my dad messed around with a bunch of junk down here. Why would he hide junk then? It's in a fricking case in the ground? Even if it wasn't junk... Dude, he must have left this for you. Okay, I know you'd like to think that... ...my dad left me a time machine, okay, but... I think this glass thing is, like, the heart of the machine. It runs everything. David. Just for a second think about it. You guys are... You guys are crazy. We can't build a time machine in my basement. I mean, did you see the tape at your seventh birthday? I mean, I think we already did build it. Shit. Hello. Sweetie, I got to go. I got to go. I'm sorry. Who were you talking to, Dad? He's just a friend, David. He's here to fix something. I won't be gone long. Promise? Of course, I promise. Here. Time me. It is February 18th, 2014. My brother has officially lost his mind. He genuinely believes he is building a time machine. Extension cords, fuses, relays, power cables. It's cool you hang out with us. You guys are my ride home, Adam. What happened to your pants? Sarah Nathan is a backstabbing bitch. Okay, so I've got five 1,000-volt DC couplers, four 70-ohm resistors, but I just can't find any capacitors. Did you check by the couplers? - What do I look like, an idiot? Well, you are trying to build a time machine, David. We're just trying to turn on this glass box, okay. Yeah, yeah, totally. Hey, excuse me, sir, but where is your time machine section? Sorry. Nobody likes her. We can all agree on something, right? I mean, you have to kill Hitler. That's like Time Travel 101. Naturally, but none of us even speak German, so... That's why God invented Google Translator, David. Exactly. - They didn't have Wi-Fi in 1939. These are all the batteries we could afford. Well, the guys who built the Hubble Telescope... ...started out building it in their garage with parts from Home Depot. What time was their curfew? - What are you doing here? Just getting a record of you burning down the house. What are you doing? I used to kind of watch Dad do a lot of this stuff. This is called stripping wire. Hey, Quinn, isn't your mom a stripper? Shut up, dude. Hey, put the camera down? I want to teach you. All right, I think we're all set. Christina, you may wanna stand back. We're pumping about 400 volts into this puppy. So, what, you plug those things together... ...and we're gonna go back to the Stone Age? No. If we can't turn the glass circuit on, there's no point in building the rest of the machine. I only have one. Sorry, guys. Let's hit it. What's happening? It's supposed to... I'm not seeing anything. Holy shit. - Crap. Are you okay? What does that even... - Give me the camera. Give me the camera. Look at yourself. Your hair. What is it? What? - Your hair. On your head. - Touch your head. Oh, my God. Wow. Guys, guys, guys. What the shit? What's going on? What's it doing? Is anybody else seeing this? It's creating electromagnetic energy. Whoa. Whoa. - Oh, shit. What the... It's in my mouth. Dude. Dude. All the batteries are fried. This battery flew up and almost hit me. Dude, it did hit me. - Film everything. From now on, film everything. I've literally never seen any inputs like this before. I mean, it must be a prototype. Let me see it. It's DARPA. They have access to more technology than we do. Intentional obsolescence. You've got to love it. Wow. This is... We need a graphics processor. Where the hell do we get one of those? You owe me a new Xbox, dude. Okay, you know what, guys? Just don't talk to me for a while. When you love something, Quinn, you have to set it free. This isn't a joke to me, Christina, okay? This is my life here. Right there, right there. Wow. What the hell is that? Some kind of navigation program. I think we can control the time machine with this. Okay, so, you're telling me that thing can run the whole machine? I thought it called for a boatload of computers. No, this was 12 years ago my dad made the schematics. They didn't have the technology. Trust me, welcome to 2014. This thing is strong enough to send a rocket to the moon. You enter the time here, and you just press the red button and boom. We're Doctor Who. - Who's Doctor Who? Dude, I am sorry for every mean thing I've ever said to you. Really? - Yeah. Mean thing today. What he said today. - Yeah, today. So, how much longer is this gonna take? Chris, it's not some high school textbook, okay. This is highly classified schematics. It could take a day, take weeks. We don't know. It goes back six weeks, but... ...we have to split the power for the return trip, so it's three weeks in the past, three weeks back. If we go further than that, we're basically stuck there. What? We're stuck in the past forever. Why? If we go more than three weeks... I'll tell you later. Goddang it. Shit, my Xbox is all tricked out. That looks good. That's insane. You finish with those couplers yet? Yeah, almost. Whoa, what the hell, man? Wait. Are you... These two wires right here? What do I do with this screwdriver? Here we go. There it is. That's it. I think I finally got this thing dialed in. This looks good, David. - You need this for something? I feel like you might need this. - No, I don't need that. Hey, guys, are we in position? Wait, let me get my helmet. Relax, the switch is cold. I thought you just said it was cold. - It's off. That is not cold. Do you know what 'cold' means? Do you feel the power? - Guys, guys, guys. What the... How is this happening? I don't know. Is it all the electromagnetic energy? Then explain this. Come here, Chris. Holy shit. Oh, my God. Look at that. - Oh, shit. What the... Guys. Holy shit, are you guys seeing this? Does it hurt? What's it like? What's my hand doing? David, the battery's overheating. Are you okay? Yeah. That was... That was awesome. These batteries are dead. It didn't work. Guys? Does this seem familiar to you? Oh, my God. Okay, so I was wrong. That's definitely you. I mean, you guys, we're... ...close. We still need hydrogen. Without it, we're done. What do you mean done? - Without hydrogen, no fusion. Without fusion, there's no time travel. Well, how much will it cost? It's not a matter of cost. I mean, you need a permit just to buy it, so... You guys, I got an idea. Cut the camera. I can't believe we're doing this. Wait, wait. There's a security guard. Hey, Argo, you realize we're not taking hostages, right? What, you didn't bring yours? - What? Can we get expelled for this? Obviously. - Shit. Let's go. Go, go, go. We're clear. Yo, what's the code? One, three, four, five. Come on, hurry. - Wait, is it... It's pi. Duh. Put it, put it, put it. Yes. Lights. - Go, go, go, go. Someone get the lights. Lights, lights. - Go, go, go. Guys, it's probably locked in one of these, okay? Wait up. David, David. David, too far, too far, come back. Yes. - Nice. God, I'm strong. Hey, get one of those crates. - Yeah. Yo, how much do we need? We'll take them all. Get the bag. We might not get another shot. Here, I got two crates. Yo, I can't carry all that. Careful, it's hydrogen. Got it. Let's get out of here. Whoa. - Come on. You frickin' idiot. - Shut up. Come on. You got the camera? - Yeah, got it. Come on, come on, come on. You first. Hey, does anyone want to take like... I don't know, like a five-minute break? It looks like Walker's having a party. Guys, it works. The hydrogen fits. Chris, get in position. What's with the watches? Okay, so if this works, when the red one comes back, it'll be 60 seconds behind the black one. Here you go. This is Project... Yeah. This is Project Almanac. Experiment one, trial one. Temporal distance, 60 seconds. In English, please? It means we're going to send your crappy toy... ...a minute back into the past. All right, you guys ready? Quinn. Are you going to set this? Shit. - One job, he has one job. GoPro, set. - Come on, come on, come on. All right, we're good. Three, two... Wait, let me put my goggles on. Chris, come on, be present, focus. One second. You good? - I'm good. Three, two, one. What the hell? - Just give it a second. Do it again, just do it again, man. Go on. Three, two, one. What the hell, Adam? Just give me a second. What did you do? - Nothing. Oh, shit. All right. - It's working. The power's holding. What's going on? Come on, come on. Oh, shit. Come on. What the hell? No, no, no, no. They're fried. - Really? You guys, we haven't had a night off in weeks. Why don't we just, you know, take it off and check out the party. Then how the hell are we supposed to do this? This thing just keeps eating through batteries, man. We need a really strong power source. Something that can recharge itself as it puts out power. It's nickel-metal hydride. Oh, my God, how did I not... For sure. What did he say? What the hell is he doing? Beats me. Why is he getting Jessie Pierce to park in our driveway? Right there's good. Whoa. Jessie Pierce drives? I assumed she just, like, appeared out of thin air, like most mythological creatures. You guys coming to the party? Yeah. We just gotta get changed. Stay out of my perfume. - Jessie, come on. I'm gonna need every jumper cable you can find. We're going to use her battery. I got them. Christina. - Here you go. What's so special about this hybrid battery? Its negative electrode uses a hydrogen-absorbing alloy... Okay, you know what? Forget I asked. Connecting now. - Wait. Dude. - That was awesome. Hey, what's the hell's taking you guys so long? Well, maybe, you know, if Adam wasn't... ...trying to kill me, then it might go a little faster. Stop laughing, it's not funny. Come on. We're good. - Let's go, let's go. Come on. Quick. Adam, clean off the table. How long do we have? I don't know. Chris, how long do girls stay at parties? Well, dude, hot girls don't stay at parties long. They go to multiple ones, like five or six a night. What do you know about that? - Is this gonna work? I don't know, there's a good chance we're gonna blow up her car. Chris, give me a hand. Here. - What? Look, I want you to make sure this connection is stable. So we just go, right, David? - Yeah. It's cool. GoPro set. Wait, let me get my helmet. Coordinates set, 60 seconds. - Come on, come on. Let me get my goggles. Shit, it doesn't reach. Guys, table, table, table. Okay, one, two, three, push. Again, again. One, two, three, push. Whoa. Everybody, back, back, back. Look at the camera. Look at the camera. Let me get my camera. I gotta get it. Let me get my camera. Hold on one second. Chris, come on. Chris, hurry up. Jeez, that was loud. Oh, my God. David, let me in. David, open the door. Shit, guys. It's Jessie. Do not let her in. She can't handle this, honestly. David, what the hell? Wh... What is going on? What are you doing? Jessie, get down. Why? What are you guys doing? Oh, my God. Project Almanac. Experiment one, trial two. Get that, get that, get that. What is all this? - Get this. Get this. Get down. Oh, my God, the lights went out. Are you guys okay? Yeah. Are you? You okay? - Yeah. That scared me. Good idea. Oh, God. Oh, God. What the hell? Wait, disconnecting. Grab the camera. Where's the... Guys, where's the Corvette? It was supposed to be here, one minute behind. What the hell did you guys do? I can't believe the Corvette's not there. This doesn't make any sense. Chris, are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Shit. Hey, guys, I found it. No way. - Oh, my God. What? It's fused to the fricking wall. No way. - Are you guys seeing this? Yo, stopwatch. My God. It went back two hours. David? Two hours? - That's what it says. What's on the GoPro? Clean off the table. - How long do we have? I don't know. It was there the whole time. Well, dude, hot girls don't stay at parties long. They go to multiple ones, like five or six a night. What do you know about that? I can't even comprehend this right now. It works. We sent something back in time. Chris... Hey. - Hey. You okay? Yeah. I just... I don't really understand what just happened. Well... We just built a time machine. We built a time machine. - We built a time machine. Smoke. Shit. The cables. Get the fire extinguisher. - Oh, my God. My car. So, what's with the backpack? I'm reducing the width of frame... ...so the machine can fit inside a 22-by-14-inch backpack. So we could just walk around with it? It'd only weigh 8 pounds. - The whole thing? Goldberg. It's time for your presentation. Did that guy just say 'presentation'? All right, everybody, settle down. Quinn, you didn't study? No, I didn't study. I've been building a time machine. Let's get this over with. You're up first. - Yeah, I know. Name the first 10 elements of the periodic table. All right, so, I was thinking we should start off small. I was making a list. Bacteria, to send through. - Yeah. I can grab something from Dr. Lou's class. He actually really likes me. Yesterday I was at Petco with my mom. And they have, like, dozens of those little white mice, and you could just send those back. Think about it. If you were a mouse, you'd be like, 'Damn, I'm time traveling right now.' Guys, I'm serious. We need to keep this quiet. Okay, Jessie saw me staring at her. That's real smooth... Real smooth, David, perfect. Guys, can you please not just all look at her? Guys, stop. Hey, guys. Smooth, guys. Nice. - Is she coming over? David, game face, put your game face on. I haven't got a game face. Somebody say something. Okay, thank you for letting us use your battery. Yeah, no problem. What are you going to do with it? Well, we're gonna test it. We're gonna... But I thought you already tested it. Yeah, yeah, but we haven't tested on a living organism. So now you're going to test it on people, right? No. Bacteria first. - Or puppies. We need to start... - Puppies? You've been to Petco, right? You've seen all the white mice? Quinn, enough with the Petco. We have to take this step by step. Be very conscious of what we're doing. Right, but shouldn't the next step be, like, testing it on us? It's not... You know, this is not a toy. We need to take it step by step... I'm not saying it's a toy, but like... I mean, there's a lot of things we have to think about... Hey, what is that? What is this? - What? My keys? Oh, my God. What's wrong with my keys? They're just really cool. You're kidding, right? Hello? - Sorry. I don't... This isn't fake, right? - No. No, it's real. It doesn't make any sense. You guys film everything, huh? I think, we have to go with... ...another inanimate object and then move our way to... No. You know, plants and... Come on. - Come on, what? You're watching this video and you're gonna send... ...another inanimate object through? It'll be very potentially dangerous. But you know that you can do this. What are you waiting for? If we increase the power to the glass circuit, the diameter of the warp could expand to 9 feet, which may fit all five of us. Graphics processor dialed in. Am I gonna get electrocuted? Setting the machine to 24 hours back. That's how far we'll push it. David, I'm getting scared. Running system diagnostic test. All systems check. Guys, turning machine to standby mode. We're ready to go. Dad, I'm not sure what you were doing down here... ...or why you were doing it, but this is for you. Full disclosure, guys. There's a slight chance that... ...oxygen and nitrogen naturally found in the air could catalyze. What does that mean? We could explode. Here. Set the GoPro up over there, so we can get a, you know, wide shot of the environment. Okay. We need to move away from the car, away from the trees, and everything, right. Get some clearance. Remember, the warp has a 10-foot diameter, so... Yeah. - Where should we go? I think, yeah, right here? Are you recording? No, the red light means something else entirely. Okay. To reiterate, because of the catalyzation of the oxygen in our lungs, do not hold your breath. You got that? Yeah. Because of the high level of impact, keep your body loose, right? - Yeah. And because of UV light, keep your eyes closed. Yeah. Okay, is anyone else, like, shitting their pants right now? Or is it... Guys, I'm not gonna lie. I'm completely terrified. But I'm the one who's on the tape. So if you guys... ...don't want to come, I understand. Okay? I'm in. If you're going, I am. I'm in, too. I'm with the group. I've done every boring thing with you since first grade. Of course I'm coming. All right. Let's step in. Wait, like right now? It's all right. It's okay. We're going to be okay. We're gonna be okay. Chris, come on, you need to get closer. Okay. All right, you guys ready for this? Yeah. - Yeah. Get in closer. Guys. Guys. Look. Holy shit. Get down. God, it's burning. David, your ears. Guys? Guys, I can't hear anything. Guys? I can't hear. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? You can? Okay. Holy shit. You okay? Where's Adam? - Yeah, where's Adam? Where's Adam? - Adam. What the hell? What the hell? My God, please tell me you got that. - Are you all right? Please tell me you got all that. You all right, buddy? I'm okay. We're okay. Did it work? Where's the car? Well, if it worked, it's not gonna be here... ...until we drive it here tomorrow. Look at this. Look. Holy shit. David, we need to see if this really worked. Wait, I got an idea. Yeah, I got a sick idea. Come on. My neighbor's dog is a beast. Why are we going in your house? - Just trust me. Seriously, this is what we're doing? My mom's asleep, just don't wake her. I want to see if this works. Have you guys ever seen the movie Looper? No. - God, I love that movie. What are we doing? What are we doing here? It's sick, right? Watch this, watch this. - No, no, no... Stop. You guys. Oh, my God. Get that. Get that. Oh, my God, this is cool. This is sick. Oh, my God, he's waking up. Guys, guys, guys... What? What? What? - What? What? What? - What? What? What? What? Oh, my God, what's happening? We've got to get him out of here. Quinn, stop looking. - Go. It was a crazy feedback loop. Look at me, are you okay? - I'm all right. Okay. Quinn, you disappeared for a second. I think we should get out of here. Yeah, we should get out of here. Let's go. We did it. We really did it. It's yesterday. It's yesterday. It's yesterday. Oh, shit. Run. - I'm trying. Run, run. Shit, it's coming. David, take us back. David, hit the button. David, get us back. Come on. Get close. Get close to me now. Oh, my God, we're alive. Adam. Oh, shit. Are you all right? Are you kidding? Holy shit. Holy shit. Guys? I don't think we're alone. Hey. Hey, puppy. Hey. He's drooling all over me. I know, he's drooling on me, too, man. Move him over there. He's on my side... Guys, why am I in the trunk? Quinn, stop pushing him on my side. Sit, sit, sit. Guys... Guys, check it out. These flyers definitely weren't here before we jumped. There's so many of them. That's weird. Do you think we changed things? What does it say? It says, 'Lost Dog.' Guys, we changed reality. Holy shit. David, come on. Well, I told you we wouldn't die. Yeah. I... No, I got my wallet. Never mind. I thought it was... Thought it was on my side of the car? No, I was just checking my backpack. Thank you for the ride. You're welcome, David. - I'll see you... See you at school. Dude, how have you never seen Timecop? Quit saying that like it's a bad thing. Look, you're missing the point. You can't go back and give yourself information about the future. Dude, wrong. That's the entire purpose of time traveling. Here, just look at Terminators one through four. My dad... He's a genius. He's an absolute genius. Dude, you could actually, like, go back and meet him now. We can do anything. - We can meet anyone. Literally. You guys, we invented freaking time travel. Why don't we sell this thing to Richard Branson for, like, a zillion dollars? We didn't invent anything, first of all. We just put it together with the directions that we had over there, so... You make it sound like we got it at IKEA. Okay, we can't sell it. No chance. We don't even know what it is. We don't even know what it can do yet. Okay, well, look, I mean, he's right, but we could beat the stock market, or win the Powerball. Stock market, Powerball. It's not about money. We could do whatever we want. Imagine the possibilities. It's like a second chance machine. We know. Okay, so we need to learn how to use it. How hard is it to learn how to time travel? Obviously, very, man. You almost short-circuited last night. Dude, you were disappearing. We gotta have rules. Okay. - Yeah? Yes. So what are they? - What are the rules then? First rule, no jumping alone. We always have to jump all together every time. That makes sense. - Yes? What else? Well, we could film all of our jumps, so that if we mess something up, we know what we did wrong. That's a good idea. - That's a great idea. And we have to keep it a secret. Right? So no Twitter, no Facebook, none of that stuff. Absolutely. We should have code names. Like safe words. You know, from now on, I want to be called Obsidian One. I'm definitely not taking part in any of that. Whatever. So what do you guys wanna do with the machine? I want to see Biggie and Tupac live. You know what? I wanna go to the original Star Wars premiere. That's not bad. Dude, that is so freaking awesome. Guys, guys, I wanna go back and meet Einstein, okay, but this machine only goes back three weeks. All right? So we have to take it slow. Keep testing it. But there's still things we can change. Well, I just failed my Chem report. And I don't really wanna repeat 12th grade, I'd probably go change that. I wouldn't mind being captain of the baseball team. No. What do you mean, no? It's not a magic wand, it's just kinda a time machine. Cool, thanks, man. Okay, right there, you guys. You're broke. You're getting bullied. I'm failing high school. You know, let's take this thing out for a spin. Cheers to that. Here's to taking it out for a spin. - Hell yeah. Let's take it for a spin. Baseball... There, that's it. I think we got it. Okay, David, so my Chem report was eight days ago. That's pretty secure. Here, let me fix your strap. Thanks. Looks good. Looks good. Experiment four, 'Bait and Switch.' Chris, are you already in class? I forgot my gym clothes. He's coming, he's coming. Okay, I see him. Chris, go stop him before he gets to Chemistry. Hey, Quinn, hey, what's up? Lou's sick, class is canceled. There's no sub? What are you, Sherlock Holmes? No, there's no sub. Sweet. - You're good, don't worry about it. We're good, we're good. Okay. Awesome job, Chris. Did it work? - Yeah. What a douche. Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, Beryllium, Boron, Carbon, Nitrogen. Then why are you texting him at 3:00 in the morning? You're overreacting. We're just friends. Quinny, listen. Relax, relax, relax. Quinn Goldberg. All right, everybody, settle down. Goldberg. Let's get this over with. Let's dance, Lou. Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, Beryllium, Boron, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Fluorine. Atomic weight of Fluorine? Atomic weight, what? Do you know it or not? You didn't ask that last time. So why would I know that? Last time? What the hell are you talking about? Goldberg, this is about comprehension, not memorization. See you after class. Okay, let that be a lesson. Comprehension. Who doesn't know the atomic weight of fluorine? Why did he ask him that? Okay, so fluorine is 15.2. Then why are you texting him at 3:00 in the morning? You're overreacting. Okay, 24.03. All right, you ready? All right, settle down, everybody. Goldberg. Let's get this over with. My thoughts exactly. Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, Beryllium, Boron, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Fluorine. Fluorine. - Yeah, Fluorine. Great, keep going. Neon, Sodium, Magnesium, Aluminum, Silicon. What's the classification of silicon? Silicon, are you kidding? Goldberg, this is about com... Comprehension, not memorization, I know. You're kidding. We have to do this again? This is hell. This is what hell is like. I made flashcards this time. I know everything backwards and forwards. Then why are you texting him at 3:00 in the morning? You're overreacting. He's just a friend. But she'll be screwing Ryan in a week. Trust me. Hey, guys, look out. Shit, it's us. Did you just check out my ass? Yeah. Yeah, I did. Quinn, even Chris knows it by now. This is ridiculous. Okay, okay. I'm gonna Groundhog Day this bitch. All right, everybody, settle down. Goldberg. Let's... Get this over with. Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, Beryllium, Boron, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Fluorine, Neon, Sodium. What's the atomic weight of... Sodium, 22.98. What's silicon's classification? Silicon's classification is semi-metallic. And its electron configuration is Ne, 3s23p2. And its atomic number is 14. Boom, Lou. That just happened. That's mine. Quinn Goldberg, pleasure. What was that? Finally. Finally. - Thank God. Perfect. - What's next? Anybody? Well, I'm being bullied in high school and I want to stand up for myself. Nice. Beat up Sarah Nathan. Got it. Let's do it. - Chick fight. I love it. Let's do it. Experiment 14, payback time. God, Christina. Walk much? Hi, Justin. You got this, Chris. You got this, Chris. I got this. I got this. But you were just... I'm everywhere, bitch. Chris, you're a beast. You're a frickin' beast. Experiment 15, saving our house. You think it's gonna work? I don't know. Youkilis with the 1-0 count. Line drive to right field. Cano scores. Yanks up, 6-2. ...down the right field line. Cano scores. Guys, what's taking so long? You think there's something wrong in there? I don't know. Do you think we can go to jail for cheating on the lottery? You guys know what we're doing isn't illegal, right? Hey, chill. I always wanted to be a getaway driver. Go, go, go, go. Jessie, start the engine. Start the engine. I got it, guys. I got it. Go. Go. - I'm going. This is gonna be so frigging awesome. We'll never have to worry about money ever again. We're gonna be so rich, I'm gonna hire Kim Kardashian to have my baby. 'Winner's Parking'. Oh, my God. Put it there. Put it right there. This is worth so much money. I respect you for that. After taxes, that's $53,876,522. Want to bet me $100,000 that you're right? I'll bet you $200,000 I'm exact. All right, wait here. I'll go check. She's checking? - She's checking. She's checking. Congratulations. You're winners. Me personally, I'm gonna take it easy at first. You know, I'm gonna get a yacht, a few Ferraris, you know, then see what happens, go from there. Okay, you guys do know that $1.8 million after taxes... ...isn't enough for what you want to do? You should save it, pay for college. I'm sorry, I thought you just said 1.8? It was 53 million, 876 thousand, and... After taxes. You guys only got five out of six numbers. Why did you put 44? - Are you kidding me? Because that's what you put down. That is not what I put down. I put a... That is a nine. That's 49, Adam. Are you blind? - How is that a nine? You have to go back and do it again. I am not winning the lottery twice. Smile, guys, come on. This is great. It's a million dollars, guys. Are you freaking kidding me? Wait, what? No, you have to use that for school. No, no. There was plenty more. Please. Oh, my God. Okay. Mom... Okay, bye. - Bye. I love you. Make yourself useful. - What the hell? Hey, welcome to Maserati. Can I help you? - Wassup, bro? What's a guy got to do to get a test drive around here? Well, I'd love to, but this is a big boy's car. You see, I was either going to buy one of these or 17 Toyota Corollas. Shoot, is that my xenon difluoride? Is that a sex doll? No, it's an insanely powerful battery. Oh, my God. Bet right now. Next person who scores, 10 grand. Get in there. - Damn it. Pay up. - This game is stupid. I wanna hear my money being counted. One hundred, 200, 300, 400... David, come on. Come hang out with us. Yeah. Look, I'll be there in one second. I just wanna tweak something with the auxiliary output, okay? David, you're allowed to take a break. Hi. So, what do you think of David? Chris, it's your brother. Don't worry, he can't hear us. He is pretty smart, huh? Experiment 16. Attempting to extend the time differential... ...between two and four years with minimal voltage input. David? You're still down here? Jess. Hey. - Hey. Sorry, I think I left my English folder. Yes, you did. It's right there. Thank you. Is there something wrong with the machine? No, I'm trying to figure out how to make it go back even further. You know what I mean? - Can you? I think so. I've been running some tests on a new battery source, xenon difluoride. You just made that up, right? No. How far back could we go if you got it to work? Ten years? Ten years. Seriously? Yeah. Ten years. Sorry. When you said 'time machine,' I thought dinosaurs, or at least Woodstock. Why do you always do that? The watch thing. I don't know. It's like a nervous habit or something. Yeah. Are you saying I make you nervous? No. I... So where did you get it? What? - The watch. My dad gave it to me before he died. I was like... On my seventh birthday. Your seventh birthday, right? - Yeah. You look just like him. Really? Handsome. - Thank you. So how did he... It was a car crash. He left my party. Had some kind of urgent call or something. I don't even really know. To be honest with you, I don't know the whole story. You think you'll go back to save him? That's what I'm trying to do. If I can just get the machine to go back that far. Maybe I'm the mastermind. Did you ever think about that? I mean, you're pretty smart. You're pretty smart. I'm just saying, like, you know, clearly something's missing. And now you have my keys and now you have me, so... Wait. What do you mean, I have you? Well, you know, I'm like... I'm part of the group now, right? What's outside? Oh, my God. I'd usually make a joke, but this is awesome. Dude, Quinn is insane. David. What up, dude? He's crazy. I got Mexican food. I got Cuban, fusion, Indian, all sorts of different flavors. Adam. Adam. Where's mine? Here, Chris. Way to go, Finn. Finn. Did she just call you Finn? Finn? All right. Finn, Finn, Finn. Finn. Finn. Finn. Finn. Finn. Finn. Finn. Finn. Finn. Finn. This is the best day of my life. Sixth period, under the bleachers, okay? Meet me there. Yeah, maybe if I'm done having sex with all these girls. And in his effort to avert the British... ...from recognizing the Confederacy, he subjugated what? He... He subjugated the what? The... Yeah, David? - Can I use the bathroom? Yeah. So... He subjugated the what? He subjugated the what of the... He subjugated... He just texted me, I swear. Hey. Yo, what's wrong with your face? What? - You're smiling, like huge. What are we doing here, David? Yeah. What are we doing here? It's a surprise. I like surprises. Shut up. - No one cares what you like. I should be in trig, David. I know, I know. Don't worry, we'll just be gone one minute. All right, guys. Who wants to push this thing back three months? How? The machine can't do that. Trust me. Just brace harder than before. This feels different. Are you sure this is okay? Guys, yo, yo, yo. I know it's not Woodstock or anything, but... It'll do. It'll do. - Yes. All right, sweet. Can I have your number? Dude, I'm supposed to be in gym right now. I'm never going home. Here. The schedule. We're not gonna see gangsta rap over Vampire Weekend. That's dumb. You guys, wait, you guys. Guys. We don't have to argue. This already happened. It's all on Instagram. I know what was sick and what wasn't. Dude, look. All right, let's go do it. Adam. Adam, hey, will you hold the camera? Oh, my God. I love time travel. Right here. - What? How did you get these? - Dude, are those VIP? Yeah, three months after the show, five bucks on eBay. - Oh, my God. Dude, David. What can we do with these? Anything. Oh, my God. - David, you're the man. We're backstage right now. We are backstage right now. I can't believe you did this. I got a surprise coming. I got a surprise for her. Listen, listen. This song goes out to Jessie Pierce. Dude, that was sick. Okay, okay. You guys, I've got an idea. Just do what I do, okay? Follow me. Hey, how are you? No way. - Bend your knees. Just bounce. Like this or something? Loosen up a little bit. Just, like do this, and you'll look like a cool guy. He's dancing. Is that good? Yeah. That's my boy. That's my boy. - I'm number one. That was so much fun. This is the best day ever. I can't believe it. Thank you so much for taking us. She's really cool, David. - Who? Jessie, the girl you've been freaking spying on for five minutes. What? Where'd you go? Hey. - Hi. This is awesome. - Yeah. Thank you very much. Best friends, man. My best friends. Oh, my God, he's actually gonna go for it. Hey. How's it going? - Hey. This is harder than it looks, huh? To write something. What would you do? 'Before the world ends, I want to dance the night away.' That's pretty dumb actually. Hey, I wrote that one. I mean, it's okay. It's not that dumb. I just... David, I'm messing with you. This is a good one. 'Before the world ends, I have to run naked through the streets.' Are you picturing me naked now? No. Really? Not even a little? Some. A whole lot. I don't know... What's the right answer? You'll never know. Sorry, dude. - No problem. Check it out.'Before the world ends, I have to time travel.' 'Before the world ends, I have to win the lottery.' Two for two. 'Before the world ends, I have to tell those bitches off'? Yeah, my sister probably wrote that. I think she did. - Don't mind her. She has a bad attitude. I think we've almost crossed everything off this list, huh? I think we're just getting started. 'Before the world ends, I have to fall in love.' Probably not the worst thing you could wish for, right? No. Probably better than owning your own monkey or something. Probably, yeah. 'Before the world ends, I wanna go skydiving.' Yeah, that's a good one, too. Totally. I heard it's really fun. I'm going to go grab a water. Okay. Yeah, all right. You know what, I'll be right here. I'll wait. Oh, my God. The world is ending. How'd it go? - What? With Jessie. What with Jessie? We were just talking. Seriously, David? She left the door wide open. No, no, she didn't. She never even... What are you guys talking about? It's okay. It's all right, man. Let's have fun. Let's just have fun. It's all right. I'm burning up. We gotta go. Okay? I mean, we gotta go. I'm gonna get some water. We gotta go soon. What happened to your shirt? We were there for nine hours. But we were only gone for 41 seconds. Dr. Lou still thinks I'm on my bathroom break. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That was the best. Best day of my life. That was the most fun I've ever had in my entire life. I love you. Yeah. David? - What? You're not gonna believe it. What are you talking about? Just go, come on. You'll see. Hey, Mom, so how was work today? It's been a long day, sweetheart. What? When did she get a job? Literally, check this out... ...4,000 likes. - Let me see. 4,000. Yeah, I have 18,000 Instagram followers. Texts from 20 different girls, half, like, 'Quinn, oh, my God, please call me.' Show me the texts. - Dude, I swear to God, I'll show you. What up? So I talked to you-know-who. Got one for you, one for Adam, one for me and one for Andre. You're down, right? Yeah, totally down. Good. Wear your black skirt. You look hot in that. You and Sarah Nathan are hanging out? What's that about? Dude, literally no idea, but since we got back, she's been acting batshit, like we're best friends or something. I don't know what happened. It's insane. Have you guys seen Jess? Yeah, but you know what? I think she just said that she's really busy or something. I wouldn't read too much into it. I'm kicking your butt. Three, two, one. You're kidding me. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Whatever, I quit. I'm inherently good at video games. All right, who's next? Hey, you don't want to play? No, I'm kind of tired. Really? - Yeah. Taking off? - Yep. Okay, cool, cool. Look... Hey, can I... Can I talk to you for just one second? Yeah, sure. Did we have some kind of, like a moment? Wasn't that a moment the other day at the wall, and... I don't know. I mean, it was a really fun day. It was cool, right? And when you said that one thing, and I kind of... I don't know, there were so many people around, I wasn't really thinking. I didn't expect you... I didn't expect someone like you... ...to really say that to me. What do you mean, someone like me? You're like, fun, and you go out to parties and, like, hang out... ...and all that kind of crazy stuff. That's it. I mean, you don't care about that important shit. You just have fun. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that. No, no, I know what you meant. It's fine. Whatever moment you thought, you know, happened, you should probably... ...just forget about it, I think. Okay. Some things just aren't meant to be, you know? You don't have to film everything, Chris. You wanna play some foosball? - No. That was so much fun. This is the best day ever. I can't believe it. '...I have to run naked through the streets.' Are you picturing me naked now? No. Sorry, dude. No problem. 'Before the world ends, I have to fall in love.' 'Before the world ends, I wanna go skydiving.' 'Before the world ends, I have to fall in love.' '...I have to fall in love.' '...love.' '...love. ' '...love. ' 'Before the world ends, I wanna go skydiving.' Yeah, that's a good one, too. Totally. I heard it's really fun. I'm gonna go grab a water. You know what, I'll be right here. I'll wait. Dude, I love this band. Look, there's David. Oh, my God, he's actually gonna go for it. A little more difficult than it looks, huh? Yeah. 'Before the world ends, I have to dance all night.' Pretty dumb. Hey, I wrote that. No, you didn't. No, I didn't. 'Before the world ends, I have to run naked through the streets.' You're trying to get me to think of you naked, aren't you? Nice catch. Check it out.'Before the world ends, I have to time travel.' 'Before the world ends, I have to win the lottery.' Two for two. I think we've almost crossed everything off this list, huh? I think we're just getting started. 'Before the world ends...' '...I have to fall in love.' Is that what you were gonna... Yes. Probably not the worst thing to wish for... All right, David, what did you change? What have you changed? Hi, Jessie. Hey, Jessie. What you up to? What's... What's poppin'? Just call her. Hello. What are you doing? What are you filming? Is everything okay? Are you poking me? By the way, I told my dad I was sleeping at Jennie's. Are you taking your towel off? Should I not take my towel off? You should. You absolutely should. What's wrong with you? Oh, my God, did we have sex? Yes. - Was it good? Was I good? Yes. Wow. So I saw you naked and... Are you kidding? - Well, I guess I did, 'cause we had sex. That's true. - Can I see? You wanna... Okay. - I want to see. Happy Friday. I have to sneak out soon. I only have Thursday's clothes. David, stop it. Whatcha doing? I'm waking up, thank you very much. You look amazing. - David, please. Stop it. David. Let me see this. Good morning, David. Stop. Camera shy, huh, David? You seem a little camera shy. You know what, let's get rid of this thing. Flight 437 has apparently crashed... Good morning, Raskin house. Chris, you look gorgeous. Christina, please put that laundry away. I don't wanna tell you again. Can you see the stain on here? 'Cause I got two job interviews today and I really need to look good. Interviews? - Yeah. Sweetie, you okay? Yeah. Mom, you look beautiful. Thanks. Bye. What's up with you? What's up with you? I can't believe how good I'm getting... ...at sneaking past your mom. - Yeah. By the way, my dad, who never loves anyone, loves you. Somehow. He thinks it's really, really adorable every time you talk about science... ...and all the projects that you used to do. It's kind of amazing. Enough, please. Chris. Please have mercy on me. What's up, Patrick? Dude, the other night was dope. Come on. God, what is up with you, David? Are we still on for tonight? Yeah. Yes, what time? Why are you acting so weird? Are you okay? - Yeah. David, are you okay? - Yeah... I forgot my... I forgot my notebook in class. Okay. I'll see you later. Okay. - Okay. Okay. - Bye. Hey, Dr. Lou. Where are you going? Don't be a wiseass, David. What? Hey, you okay. Sarah, what's up? Everyone just mind their own business. God, what the hell is up with him? 'Better luck next year'? But we won the division. Hey. You got to get over here right now. Quinn, hold on, slow down. Oh, my God. Are you seeing this? I just don't understand how this is even possible. How do we not remember this? But we could fix this, right? We could fix this. I mean, we have the means, right? This is what we should be doing in the first place, not partying. Hey. Guys, what's the emergency? David, look at this. There was a plane crash, David. Seventy-seven people on board a flight from London to Madrid. It happened five days ago. Jesus. So, why are you guys watching a plane crash? Because I think it's our fault. Why would a plane crash be our fault? Sarah Nathan's dad was the pilot. So what? Look, whatever we did at Lollapalooza had some crazy ripple effects. Wait, wait. Are you saying that Lollapalooza caused a plane crash? Because that sounds crazy, dude. Look, I'm not crazy, okay. It's cause and effect. Somehow we caused the basketball team to not make the playoffs. Our captain, Justin Kelly, broke his leg on March 1 st, right? We all know that never happened. Then the basketball team didn't make the playoffs, and that affected the players, their parents, hundreds of people who were supposed to be at the game. And it just kept spreading. Sarah Nathan's brother, he was on the team, right? Yeah. Her dad was supposed to be at the game. He wasn't supposed to be flying that night. David, look... Dude, there's other shit, too. Robberies. Fires. None of this happened before. At some point, we're not gonna be able to track this, David. If we don't stop this now, it could just keep going out of control. David, we have to fix this. Look, Lollapalooza was a mistake. We have to go back and make it so that... ...we never jumped there in the first place. Right. - No, no, no. We cannot go back. We cannot do that, okay? - That's the only way. We have to. - It's gonna undo everything... That's the point. We need to undo it. - We gotta fix this. I'm not even buying it. I don't even think... Dude, you were the one who set the rules. You're the one who said that we had to be all freaking careful. I did. We all followed them, and kept each other accountable on every single one. I'm not gonna go and play God with you guys... David, you know what? That is what we're doing. I'm gonna get Jessie, we're gonna come over tonight and we're gonna fix this. If you wanna vote on that 'cause that will make you feel better, then that's fine, but that's what we're doing. David, we get it, okay? None of us will remember Lollapalooza. Yeah. Hey, Justin, look out. I'm calling 911. Screw this. Oh, shit. Guys, I'm here. David, it's me. It's April 23rd, 2014. This is to keep a record. I know exactly what to do to fix this. Justin broke his leg at Walker's party. I'll fix that. Everything else will fall into place. Guys, I'm sorry. It's gonna be okay. Oh, shit. Shit. David, what are you doing here? What do you mean? This is where we're supposed to meet. You're 15 minutes late. No, we said we'd meet at your house first. We had to track the controller. Yeah, why didn't you call me? We all called you, David. Really? - The guys are right behind me. Really? - What did you do to the machine? You know, I'm just making some modifications. Modifications? Why? We did a full systems check yesterday. Can I talk to you for a second? What's on that? - Just... Oh, God, man. Can you just be my friend for a second? I have to ask you. Of course I'm your friend. You know, like, the plane crash in Spain... ...and the basketball team and the fires in Brazil. It's not your fault. We've been over this, okay. No, no, no, no. You're not listening to me. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. It's my fault. I went back alone. There... Alone? - Yeah. Why would you ever jump alone, David? David... It's not important. But where did you jump to? It doesn't matter. It's done. Stop it. Stop it. We don't have to undo everything, okay. We just have to make sure Justin doesn't break his leg at Walker's party. We can fix it, man. You gotta trust me. I can fix it. You can fix it? By yourself? Yeah, you broke the pact once and now you're gonna do it again? You're coming clean. - No. I can't. Why not? - Because... Why, David? Because I'll lose her, man. I'm sorry, David. But you have to come clean. Guys. Guys, let's go. Come on. No, no, no, no. David, don't go. I'm sorry, Adam. I would never do... ...anything to hurt you guys. - David. You won't even remember this happened. Hot girls don't stay at parties long. They go to, like, multiple ones. Table, table, table. Again, again. Hey. - Oh, shit. David. What the hell are you doing to my car? Three, two, one. The lights went out. Sorry, excuse me. Coming through. Excuse me. Justin, look out. Oh, shit. You saved me, bro. David, you're awesome. You're like a superhero. Excuse me. - That was so awesome. Right here, man. That was badass. - Excuse me. You have two new messages. Hey, babe, sorry I missed you. I'll see you later tonight. Miss you. David, are you coming? We gotta go. We have to be there by 5:00. Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming. One second. What the hell's she talking about? Are you gonna go in? Yeah. Quinn, thank God. Hey. You all right? You look like shit. I'm fine, I'm fine. Adam. We don't have much time. Visiting hours are almost up. Did he say anything? What are you talking about? He can't speak. He barely knows where he is. Yeah, I... I know that. Did they find anything else out? Nothing. Just that it happened after the basketball game. Oh, shit. So they don't know what happened. No, they don't know anything, but, I mean, look, it's fine. We'll just, you know, figure out when the last time he was safe was and just, you know, go back. He was fine in school this morning. What're you talking about? That was yesterday. He's been here since last night. David, why don't you know this? I do know, I'm just... My fucking head, man. Look, we gotta do something. Okay, I'll get Jessie, we'll come over tonight. No, no, I'll get Jessie, okay? Forget it, just come to my house. When? - I don't know, just tonight. What does that mean? - I'll call you... ...when I'm in touch with her, okay? Something is wrong here. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna... David. David. David, where are you going? Chris, just stay here. - I don't have a ride. I'm coming back. - Hey. Okay, Adam. When is the last time you were safe? Effects of Lollapalooza. That's Justin. That's a different day. Doesn't connect to anything at all. Plane crash had nothing to do with it. Adam. The basketball game. Robberies. Adam... Tuesday, 7:00 p.m. Everything should be all right. Oh, shit. Tuesday. David, what are you doing? No, Jessie. Don't come in here. Stay back. Please. - Where are you going? Don't come in the warp. No. David. Shit. David, when are we? It's Tuesday. Adam's still okay. I can make it so he never ends up in the hospital. What about everyone else? What happened to 'nobody jumps alone'? I know. I'm sorry for yelling at you. I just keep thinking I can go back and I can fix it myself. I don't have to worry about anybody else. You keep thinking? What do you mean? How many times have you done this before? David, how many times have you done this before? I'm sorry. Wait, where are you going? David. David. - Jess. You have to stop talking. You're being too loud. People are gonna hear you. I don't care if people can hear me. You have to tell me. What did you change? Lollapalooza. Wha... 'Before the world ends...' That's why you and I... - No, Jess. Listen. Listen to me. I didn't mean for this to happen. After everything, you're just a liar. Jess, I understand how this could feel... You have no idea how this feels. You played me. Like I was just some idiot... ...that would just fall for your trick or something. Stop it. There was no other way I could have got you. You didn't care that it was dangerous? That all of your friends could be hurt? We had this real connection. I knew it, and I just went back and I wanted another chance, and I... I was the person that I should have been. How do I know that you're telling me the truth? That's who I should have been. How do I know that this hasn't already happened before? Twice before? How do I know that? No. Jesus, David. I mean, did you ever stop to think that maybe I've liked you since the first time I met you? No, I didn't. Well, you know what I would have done? If I was as smart as you, if I could have built a time machine? What? I would have used it so I could go back and meet you sooner. Jess. David. Jessie. I love you. Guys, I'm here. David, it's me. Shit. You gotta let go. You gotta let go. David, it's me. David, it's me. David, it's me. David, it's me. David, it's me. Jess, no. Jessie. Oh, shit. No, no, no, no. Jess. Oh, God, please. No, no, no. Shit. Oh, my God, no. I can save you. Please, please. Come on. Come on. Jess, I got you. Shit. There's gotta be more hydrogen in here. David, it's Quinn. Open up. Yo, dude, Jessie's missing and no one can find her. Is she here? I screwed up. I screwed up. I wasn't trying to hurt Jessie, I swear. I was just trying to keep Adam from getting in this accident. Dude, Adam's fine. Adam's not in the hospital? Jesus. How many times have you jumped? It doesn't even matter anymore. The timelines, you know, they can, like, crisscross. I just need to get more hydrogen. I'm going back to the beginning. Why would you need to go back that far? Because that's the only way to stop all this from happening. I need to stop this machine from ever being built, Quinn. David, think about what you're saying. The machine has given us everything. We can't just get rid of it. It's bigger than just us. Don't you see that? I'm going. - You are not thinking clearly. We can't go back to the way things were before. Quinn, don't you get it? The only way to fix this is to destroy everything. Dude, people know who we are. I've never had that. Quinn, I need you to trust me, okay? This is the Atlanta Police Department. Open up, please. - Quinn. Okay. We're looking for David Raskin. Just be careful, dude. Open up, please. You guys go to the back. If anybody finds this, I want you to know I didn't mean to hurt anybody... ...and I didn't kidnap anyone. I was just... I just wanted a second chance. My name is David Raskin. And I built a time machine. Police Department. Break down the door. Oh, shit. Come on. Come on. There he is. Stop him. David Raskin, Atlanta PD. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I see him. David, stop. Get on the ground, David. The suspect was last seen headed towards the school. You guys take the front. Stevens, come with me around the back. Let's move. Take the other side. Let's go. Oh, shit. Suspect inside. Kick down the door. Kick down the door. Go. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. So you take my keys and you disappear forever. I need to go back to the beginning. The timelines crisscross... Ten years total. You look just like him. I won't be gone long. - Promise? You think you'll go back to save him? Save him? Guys, I'm so sorry. Christina. Sweetie, I have to go. I have to go. What are you doing in my house? David? Hi, Dad. You figured it out. Yeah. I don't... I've got so many questions. We can't. I can't. We were wrong. There are no second chances. Are you okay? I'm going to be okay. Hey, Dad. Dad, are you down there? I think it's time for you to say goodbye to your son. I'm proud of you. Who were you talking to, Dad? Just a friend. He's here to fix something. Where are you going? It's my birthday. You caught me, pal. You know I wouldn't be leaving... ...unless it was real important. I won't be gone long. Promise? Of course I promise. I'll tell you what. Why don't you... Time me. - Time me. You guys ready for this? What is this? Did you just check out my ass? Yeah. It's yesterday. This song goes out to Jessie Pierce. He is pretty smart, huh? Stay out of my perfume. I'd go back and meet you sooner. 'Before the world ends, I have to fall in love.' I love you. What are you, sulking? God. You scared the shit out of me. I'm not sulking. Why are you up here? It's dumb. You know, there's this one last scholarship where I have to... ...submit a proposal for an experiment and I thought... ...maybe if I got it, Mom wouldn't have to sell the house. Dad must have a million ideas lying around up here. I don't know, Chris. I mean, I thought there'd be something up here. I can't find anything I can use. Hey, what is this? When did we get a video camera? It's right here. This is Dad's old camera. Did Dad have two old cameras? I don't know. Yeah. I guess. They both say 'Property of Ben Raskin.' Yeah, let me see. Weird. Do they work? Yeah, it's playing. When did we get a video camera? That's Dad's old camera. Remember that? Yeah. Hey, look, it still works. I mean, what the hell is he supposed to say to her? He can't just walk up to her and be like... Would you just be quiet? Are you trying to communicate with me... Telepathically. How did you know I was gonna say that? This is gonna sound crazy, but I think we're about to change the world.
