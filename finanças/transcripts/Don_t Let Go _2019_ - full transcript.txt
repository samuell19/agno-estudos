About if anything unusual's been going on, like the thing with the white car. You know, new people. Conversation you overheard that seemed strange. Maybe... maybe something having to do with your mom? Maybe they had a big fight recently, or... maybe you noticed your dad seemed to have stopped taking his medications. I-I don't understand. Why are you even asking? JACK: The truth is, all this is about a case, but it's not an ordinary case. It's a case to do with your dad. ASHLEY: A case? Well, what kind of case?

He-he's dealing drugs again? JACK: It's possible, yes. ASHLEY: Well, I mean, if-if he's off his medications, he really doesn't seem like it. He seems good, and to answer your other question, him and my mom haven't been fighting at all, at least from what I've seen. They've actually been very sweet and cuddly (laughing): with each other lately. They seem really good. And if I really think about it, especially my dad. He's been in a good mood, and he's been getting back into his music. Actually, he's been writing this really beautiful new song. I don't think it's gonna be a hit or anything, but it's really pretty.

How in the heck do you know that? Uncle Jack, how do you know that?! 'Cause I was looking at your dad's credit report 'cause of the case. I saw a receipt for, uh... for paint. Right. Okay. I mean, yeah. He repainted it a few days ago. I guess as part of kissing my butt for screwing up the other night. He did the whole thing himself. Which was nice but slightly annoying, because you know how when painters paint and they do a sloppy job and they accidentally seal up the cracks? - JACK: Uh-huh. - Well, that's what happened, and now my window's stuck. Your window's stuck? Yeah, it's totally sealed shut. I don't think I can open it without a crowbar. But what are we doing talking about my window? Ugh. It's too bad I don't know his e-mail password so I could check and see if there's a Georgie... or... You know what? One thing I could maybe do... I could Google the bug-eyed car and try to figure out what kind it is. Or, I mean, if-if it comes back, I-I could go outside and see if there's plates on the rear.

My family. BOBBY: Jack. (dog barking in distance) What is it? What is it? What is it? Oh, no. They died on a Tuesday... instead of a Wednesday. BOBBY: Jack, what is wrong with you? Huh? Baseball mitt, what's-what's that about? (scoffs) Next stop is Little League. Howard got pissed because Cooper forgot his lucky glove.

What day of the week is it? - It's Tuesday! - Tuesday. Tuesday. - Shit. - You gonna tell me what's going on? What time is it? What time is it? Do you even know what's going on? The glass on her phone. When she died before, it was... it was cracked. BOBBY: When she died before? And now the newspaper says they died on a Tuesday instead of a Wednesday. What-what the fuck? The newspaper said they died on a Tuesday - instead of a Wednesday? - Yeah. The newspaper changed the date of their deaths? Boy, I hate to say it, but you sound insane, J. (train whistle blaring) (indistinct chatter nearby) Bobby... we got to go. We got to go. We got to go. We got to go. Hey. Did someone call 911 and report Garret for possession? Yeah, but it was a dud. How is it you don't remember that? JACK: Actually... actually, I do. I do re-remember. BOBBY: Jack, what is wrong with you? - Huh? - JACK: The pills. There were no pills on the bed. BOBBY: Pills on the bed? And her bike was out back. Her backpack. How'd her backpack get wet? BOBBY: That's a good question, Jack. But what I want to know is why you're asking all these questions right here, right now, just all of a sudden. (muttering) (train whistle blowing) It's this nightmare.

Why did I get you to paint the red "X"? What are we doing sticking things under the table? The fact is, believe it or not, I'm sitting right here, holding a dried-up, chewed-up piece of red gum you just stuck under the table. But for me, it's two weeks old.

(officers murmuring) You know what, everybody, just back the hell out of here! HOWARD: You heard the man. Get out. Get out! (footsteps departing) (door closes) All right. Circle of trust. Let's hear it. My niece's backpack. It's here in evidence. It was found on the scene. But I know for a fact that she lost it - the day that she was killed. - Wait, wait, wait. How in the world would you know that? BOBBY: Jack? I can't say. All right, well, what are you suggesting? The backpack... that somebody planted it on the scene? What reason in the world - would a perp have to do that? - I don't know. Okay? I don't... I don't... I don't know. BOBBY: I-I think I might. The plates you had me call in, the owner of that vehicle, is he the guy who did this to you? All I know is that car was parked in the lot of a building I went inside, and some guy comes out, guns blazing... - Building where? - (panting) And why were you entering it? HOWARD (scoffs): Okay. You know what, Jack? Forget it. Don't even bother to answer that. Your homeboy's finished. You grab his badge, his gun, his keys, and you escort him home. Shit. The plates he had me call in belonged to Lee! Sergeant Roger Lee of Internal Affairs. What? Roger Lee? The prick who interviewed me a couple days ago? It means that maybe Lee... is Georgie. I mean, if that's... if that's true, then we have got to go and brief Eaves. Now, I'll set it up, but he's gonna want to hear Jack's story straight from the horse's mouth.

Leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. - Thanks. Bye. - (beep) (door opens) (car door closes) So, this Georgie you've been chasing, we've both been telling half-truths, because we're under strict orders to keep it quiet. - By who? - I.A. and the D.A. HOWARD: Georgie's a group created by a bunch of dirty cops. That sketch I showed you, it's a fictitious character. Doesn't exist. So he can never be caught. It was driving us crazy for years until Eaves, who's running I.A.'s case on this, he told us we're chasing our own tails. The point is, you seem to have uncovered the fact that the number two guy in command of the good guys at I.A. is, in fact, one of the bad guys. Speaking of which, we ought to get going. And where exactly are we going? Well, unless you want to stop off at a hospital on the way, we've got to go and download Eaves. You're gonna tell him how you got so tangled up in all this. And who knows? Maybe he can help you find whatever the hell it is you think you're looking for. Okay? Let's go. Jack, come on, man. (horn honking) - What's up, Ash? - Hey, Bobby. All right, let me get this. I got this. ASHLEY: Thanks for getting here so fast. BOBBY: Of course. You call me, I'm there. BOBBY: So, exactly what's going on, huh? ASHLEY: Like I said on the phone, I-I... I just have a feeling it would be a good thing if you came over. BOBBY: Is-is it your dad? Is he drinking? Is he... is he doing drugs again? Is he... Y-You want to talk about it? - No. - No? No. It's just good that you-you came and picked me up. Yeah, well... well, you know I got you. Do you mind if I charge my phone? (chuckles): Hey. Help yourself. Sir, one thing you haven't said yet is how exactly my brother was involved in all of this. Do we know? Well, for a few years now... well, you probably know this already... your brother reverted back to his old ways to pay the bills. Unfortunately, it got him caught up in a transaction with an out-of-town associate of Georgie's... (chuckles) who had no idea he was selling evidence to the brother of a cop. Well, you can imagine, those beans get spilled, tightknit group of cops on the make, fragile trust, their cover blown by the ne'er-do-well brother of the oh-so-honest Jack Radcliff, people get uptight. They start thinking they've got to shoot their way out. JACK: So, where does this lead to? Into the Olympic Forest on the backside of Kenneth Hahn. You ever been there before?

Just keep passing right on by, homeboy. (laughs) (sighs) HOWARD: You know, it's amazing. This guy's habitually late. Ah, we wait around here anymore, we're all gonna get skin cancer.

Don't you even think about it, Jack. Point that fucking gun at the ground. And put it on the hood of the car right now. So, you sure you don't want to tell me... ...what we're here for before we go inside? Um... truth is, I think my parents are in some kind of serious trouble. I was hoping you could come in and you could talk to 'em, maybe? Make sure they're okay? Yes. I mean, sure. I figured you would have called your Uncle Jack to... help you deal with your folks, but... why didn't you? Um... I-I don't know. I guess I just didn't want to this time. (Bobby laughs) Okay. I'll give it a shot. Thanks again for doing this. Aw. - Absolutely. - (Ashley laughs) - (Bobby laughs) - (car door bell dings) (dog barking in distance) There you go. - Hey, hey.

Go inside, baby. - (Susan whimpers) - Get in there! - Go! - (Wilco barks, Ashley screams) - Control your dog. Control that damn dog. - Wilco! - Get in the kitchen, you understand me? - Wait. Go, go. - Go, go, go. - Take the dog and get in the kitchen. - (Ashley screaming) - Anybody else here? No. Nobody's here, man.

Put it on the hood of the car! (panting) Move. Over here. (Jack panting) Back the fuck up. You figure out why Howard is dead yet? Because he was clean. The backpack, Jack. How'd you do that? You don't have ESP, so how did you know that your niece lost it? Just tell me the truth, and we can figure out what's next. BOBBY: The box under the bed, Ashley. I need to know how you knew what was in it. - (Ashley whimpering) - You don't have X-ray vision, so how did you know? Huh? Just tell me the truth. We can figure out what's next. Who... did you learn about her backpack from? Who's your witness, Jack? (Jack panting) You want to know who told me about her backpack? You want to know who told me about her backpack? It was Ashley. Ashley? Told you about the backpack? That's right. Ashley's the one who called you on your phone? (panting): That's right. BOBBY: The box, - Ashley. - Hey, we... Look, look, why don't you sit with us, man, and we can.... we can sit here, and we can talk about things calmly, thinking, okay? - Okay. - (Wilco barking) Since you don't seem to be realizing the gravity of all this! - (Wilco yelps) - (Ashley screams) - GARRET: No! - Stupid motherfucker! - Get down! Stay down. - You stupid motherfucker! - (Bobby muttering) The irony of all this is I told your brother, Jack. I begged him! BOBBY: I said, "Get out of town!" But the motherfucker thinks he can talk his way out! Look, look, stop, please. Look, look. - Look, we can fix this, okay? - (Ashley sobbing) We can fix this. You're not a killer, man. You're not a killer, no more than me, okay? All right, you was just thinking down the line, right? You were thinking about your kids and-and your family. But please, man, we all make mistakes, right? We make mistakes. We can fix 'em, Bobby. - Bobby, listen to me, man! - ASHLEY: Please. Please! Please! Ashley, your Uncle Bobby tried to save you. Tried to save you all. I came to your daddy and told him what was coming. I told him to get you all out of town. And did he do it? No. BOBBY: He stays, which I promised wasn't gonna happen, and now they don't just want to kill him. They told me it has to be me. See what I'm made of. BOBBY: How could you do this, man? You had every chance in the world. Why didn't you get your family out of harm's way? - Bobby, man, I'm so sorry. - Why did you do it? I'm so sorry, man, but we can fix this, man. We're family, right? We're family, Bobby! BOBBY: Look, since nobody seems to want to tell me the truth, you leave me with no choice. I need... you to turn around and get down on your knees, Jack. I'm not giving you that.
