Vegas has definitely, always been a town that knows how to make things disappear. People, money, you name it. If it's in the way, it's gone. Growing up in Vegas, when the mob ran Vegas, you would see stuff like car bombings and people would just go missing. When they were gonna do a new construction site, or something like that. So, that's kind of the way it was out here growing up in the early 80s. If you ended up dead in a ditch in the desert, it was probably because you tried to get in the way of the money. And in Vegas, that's just something you don't do. - My name is Kate Barton, I'm an attorney in San Diego, California. October 1st, was a struggling point for me. In 2015, my mom passed away fairly suddenly, on October 1st. So, I was just kind of trying to put that out of my mind. So we got to the concert and we were just having a great time. There's something special going on. There were some swings and you could have a great view of the strip. Oh my God, we're flying now, oops yay - My friend and I were just having so much fun. Oh my God, there's the stage. - But after coming home from three combat tours, 10 years as a Marine, my first concert as an adult, it's like my third time to Vegas in my life. ♪ Sing God bless America ♪ - There was 22,000 of us singing God Bless America, just enjoying the last night of the festival. ♪ God Bless ♪ - Strangers for holding hand with strangers, we were all swaying back and forth. And we're just so thankful to be there, be part of that night and have this experience. ♪ Bless America ♪ - And I remember looking at my friend and saying, "I think this is the happiest "that I've been since my mom died" - The lady in front of me said, "Hey, is that gunfire?" I said, "Nah, I think I'd recognise that, you know, I'm a Marine." I was being a little cocky, to be honest with you. - Then I heard pop pop again, I said, "No, that gun fire, we need to start moving." - Then I knew what the sound was, but I didn't know where it was coming from. And then when he ran off the stage, that's when everyone realised something is really wrong. - The girl in front of me fell down. Oh my God. - The man behind me, just tackled me to the ground and yelled, "It's gunfire don't move." Hey, get down, down now. Oh my God. - There's in a little in a the rounds started ricocheting all around us. Behind the hotdog cart. Stay down. - I'm thinking terrorist attack, to be honest. That was my initial thought process. I knew people had to be helped. - I was going through this tunnel right here, turned on my cell phone and then the echo went like - The lights went off. - And I look back to the girl in front of me who had initially fallen and her eyes were completely blank. And I realised that we were both laying in a puddle of her blood. - It sounds like it's 20 or 30 feet away from me. That's when I called my husband and I told my husband, I'm not going to make it, I'm not going to make it, I love you. - Gun shots came, raining bullets all over us, stay on the ground. He's shooting from the Mandalay Bay. - Felt like I was never getting away from the bullets. Move, go. - I'm gonna die any second. Hey. Here, take that. He shot from the window of Mandalay Bay. Let's move, go. Move that way, now. Let's move that way, now. I need. It's coming from like eight levels up. - You can see the fire. You can see the blasts from Mandalay Bay coming through. - I didn't know when that bullet was going to come, but I almost felt like it was inevitable. - I'm down, I got shot. - Where, where, where, where? - My arm, my arm. - All right, move, move, we got a casualty. Go, go, move, move. Just a little nick big guy, just calm down. - I was running so fast, my foot got stuck on the food truck hitch and I flew onto my elbows. And my elbow popped up out of my arm. Picked up my arm and I kept running. - There, go, go, go, go, go. - A man, ran up next to me and said, "As soon as this stops, you have to run. "When the bullets stop, run." And I said, "I don't know where these bullets were coming from." As he turned to point in the Mandalay Bay direction, "They're coming from over-" And then I heard it ping and he fell backwards into my lap. And I looked down at his face and there was a bullet hole above his eye. And my hands had just sunk And it just felt like my hands were inside of a pumpkin. And I screamed and just kept running. - MGM Live Nation, had concrete barriers randomly behind our booths. So when the crowd started filtering in, I got pushed over the concrete barrier from the booth because the people started tearing down the big thick walls for us to get out. - There's 22,000 people and we're all trying to get out. But there not enough exits. And with the top of the fence, I just kind of rolled over. And when I hit the concrete, I lost consciousness. - He fired over 1100 pounds. So, after the final volley, he picked up the LMT, fired two additional rounds. One he fired into the tank area and then 10 seconds later, he fired another one. Picks up the revolver, walked towards the window and fired the last round. - I find another young lady that was shot and I put her in the car. I ended up running back in and at that point, a young lady was hit in the eye. - The next thing I remember was someone shaking me and things slowly starting to come back into focus. On your feet. - We finally got into Hooters. There were bloody footprints everywhere. - I get into Hooters and there was people in there and they're bleeding and they're screaming. And everybody, it's just complete chaos. My husband's texting me. He's following Instagram. He said, "Shooter headed towards Hooters." He says, "Get out." - At 10:45 about, we heard a noise, from directly outside the exit closest to us, that sounded like another volley of shots. At that point, we all panicked. The shots sounded very close. Too close to be from the same source as the shooting at the venue. So, that's when it really occurred to us, maybe there's more than one person involved. - I remember just following a big group into the Tropicana, then running into another room because somebody said, "They're coming, they're coming." And that's what I ended up in the MGM. It was like about midnight, and that's when people came right into the casino, screaming like saying there were shooters coming after them too. I sat there crying in tears and these gamblers just sat there and smoked their cigarettes and just looked at us like, what's going on here with these people, you know, gambling. - As soon as we got outside of Hooters, it was Vegas as normal. It was like stepping into a different world. I was completely covered in blood and all down the front of me and dripping down my legs. And no one seemed to notice or care. It was just, "Oh here's a customer, she needs a cab, let's get her into one." We drove to my hotel, a woman who was going up the escalator looked at me and just turned green and threw up because I literally looked like a zombie who had just come out of a horror movie, but it was real life. The one side of my face and my hair was completely soaked with blood from when the shooting first started. And I had laid next to the girl in front of me and the rest of my body was covered in blood. And what was essentially, the man who had tried to help me, his brains all over the front of me. I just broke down. I was hysterical. I was screaming, I was crying, I had lost control over all of my emotions. And a floor manager came up to me and he told me that I need to calm down, I was drunk and that I had spilled, it looked what he thought looked like spaghetti, all over myself, and that I should go up to my room and take a nap and change and everything was fine. - We ended up making it out to Henderson hospital. So waking up at 3:00 a.m. from surgery and my arm isn't the same. Couldn't move, Couldn't move for a week. And that's all that I did was lay around, for like two-and-a-half months. - Here I am in a wheelchair, because I couldn't walk properly. I had hematomas the size of baseballs, two on each side. - I had 10 breaks in seven different bones. Three bones in my right foot were broken and I had three pretty serious fractures in my pelvis. - Good evening, obviously I'm Sheriff Joe Lombardo from Clark County, and I'm here to talk to you about the tragic event that's taking place at the Mandalay Bay. We determined there was a shooter on the 32nd floor. Officers responded to that location and engaged the suspect at that location. He is dead, we are looking at an excess of 50 individuals dead and over 200 individuals injured, at this point. There has been multiple, multiple phone calls and accusations or conjecture coming through social media that there is multiple shooters at other resorts that has been proven to be false. - Within less than 12 hours, he had already dismissed the possibility of multiple shooters. He had already dismissed the possibility of it being terrorist related. - We believe it's a sole actor, a lone Wolf type actor, and we have the place under control. - This crime scene included the Mandalay Bay. It included a venue that was four times as long as a football field. It included the streets around the venue. It included what people had heard at the Tropicana. There were people that passed away as far away as the street in front of Hooters. So, I don't know how it could have been investigated within less than 12 hours. - My name is Mike Turber, I was former intelligence in the air force, I was a senior intelligence analyst. And over the time that I did that job, I acquired a certain skillset that becomes rather useful, in the type of situation that I found myself in, in Las Vegas. The very first task that I was given by the attorneys was to determine how safe or how secure their service elevators were. - In the aftermath of One October, MGM resorts in Mandalay Bay promised to increase security, especially around the guest and service elevators. - The service elevator is how the One October shooter got his weapons into his hotel room. Would be very closely monitored by the hotel, but perhaps not. - There's no key required. I was able to go up and down those service elevators at will, without anyone ever asking me a question. This is Mike Turber, making the same trip through the hallways and up the service elevator, something he said he's done 27 times since the One October shooting. Paddock used to transport his arsenal to his hotel room. - He actually had help, with the valet bringing up the weapons and into a cart and up to his room. - Metro police here in Las Vegas confirmed a bump stock was added to the weapons pictured in those exclusive photos that I obtained. - Several images of Stephen Paddock were leaked to the media. - What I can tell you is I'm very troubled by it. And we have an internal investigation occurring as we speak, on how those photographs were obtained by the public. The source of those leaked images. Your department has worked through the night to identify all the victims of Sunday evening's mass shooting at the route 91 Harvest Festival. We have identified all but three victims. We still have an active scene at the grounds near Mandalay Bay. - There's a wonderful guy, his name is Greg Zanis. He made all of these white crosses, 58 crosses and displays them at the Las Vegas welcome sign. - I'm planning to put every name on these crosses. I'm trying to get every single photograph on these crosses. And this just shows everybody, the severity of what happened here as you look down this row of crosses. And I'd like to just show everybody that we're sick and tired of murders here in America. - We talking about the largest mass shooting in the history of the United States. 58 deceased victims. Directly related to the One October shooting. - The fund that the sheriff and I set up yesterday, has now surpassed 53,000 individual donations. That's an excess of $3.7 million. - Vegas Strong was a GoFundMe fundraiser, that was started by Steve Sisolak and Joe Lombardo. Steve Sisolak running for governor and Joe Lombardo, who was running for reelection for sheriff of Clark County. - So at this point, I wanna thank the community, I wanna thank you for letting me be your sheriff and Vegas Strong. - It's popped up all over since the One October shooting. Billboards, posters, and of course on the internet as a hashtag, Vegas Strong. More than just the phrase now, a symbol of the city's unity. - We put the Vegas Strong up on the building just to kind of show, you know, unity with the community that we are part of the movement. Along with a lot of other local businesses, we put the Vegas strong up and we wanted to support the movement and help raise money for the victims. This is the Healing Garden. This is the garden dedicated to the victims of the October 1st shooting. The school that my kids go to, had a night where everybody got to paint a tile and they brought it here and they put them here in the Healing Garden. I'm trying to find my tile now. And here's one of them right here. - The healing garden is located in a nowhere of Las Vegas. The world Trade Centre, 9/11 Memorial, is that, you know, on a river somewhere? Or is it, you know, near Central Park? No, it's on the site where that occurred. It's is highly unusual to have a Memorial Site, seven miles from the site of the massacre. - My first initial reaction to that, I felt like it was overdue for Las Vegas only because, you know, after 9/11, when I was still a Motor Sergeant and a lot of reports came in that they might be trying to bring a tanker truck down the strip and crash it into something that would be an easy way to make a giant explosion, kill a lot of people, after 9/11. So the first time in my life I ever went down the strip and I didn't see any taxis, hardly any cars and no people. When it's a Saturday and it should have been packed. And that went on for weeks. So they're definitely aware that if people thought there was a terrorist attack being carried out in Las Vegas, fast and furious. - Las Vegas emergency incidents. We were the first people that report live from the route 91 concert through our members and through one of our page admins, they were live streaming and putting it on our page. So, when the shooting was happening and the first shots were fired, it was being streamed live on our page at the time. So, we actually became the first people to report it, you know, through our page members in the entire world. We have multiple reports of multiple shooters coming in from all over the place. - There is radio reports, but it's, you know, not like we haven't gotten false radio reports, and they turned out to be unfounded. And so you can't totally rely on a radio report. - I believe I heard a second shooter at Hooters, which may or may not be correct, but that's what I strongly believe that I had heard. And I know I wasn't the only one. So I called the Las Vegas police, and I told them exactly what my experience was, including the fact that I believe there was a second shooter at Hooters. They told me that my recollection must be incorrect. Perhaps I had been drinking too much that night and that they were not interested in pursuing any leads a lone Wolf attack. And I called the FBI, I told them the same information, and they told me, "You need to stop saying that there was a second shooter, that's not what happened." - I hear the shooting and then I pan up, and you can see that stroke. I thought that was the shooter right there on the 10th floor. So, here I am coming up here and this is where I stopped. And this is where I was hearing the shooting. And of course, right above is room 134 and 35. - Most of the shooting that you hear through your recording, it sounds fairly distant. - It seems like it's coming from up there. Oh. - There's one burst where it's really loud. There's lots of conspiracies related to that video. - Right, that's when I'm going underneath the portraiture. - Okay, so you think that was simply because of your proximity to where the shooting was happening. - The FBI came over and it was nine days later, and they said, "Oh, we're leaving no stone unturned, and we just wanna let you know that there was only one shooter and he's dead." And I thought, well, that's kind of weird. Why did you just tell me five minutes ago that you're leaving no stone unturned, and really, you know, looking things up, and now you're telling me there's only one shooter. I think the FBI saw that people had seen my video millions of times, and I had been in some interviews, and wanted to make sure that I was telling people that there was only one shooter and he's dead. So, you know what? Come on back to Vegas, spend your money. - The machines aren't working if you're not pulling the one arm band and they're not making no money. And I think that's what they're afraid of. I think they were afraid of a period of time where people say it's not safe to go to Vegas. - It's been a very, very difficult time for us. And as we look forward to continuing what our great city does. We offer a safe place, this is a crazed lunatic full of hate, we don't know much about his background. - The brother of the suspect is in town, we are in contact with him, along with the other family members. - My goal was to try to help the cops. I just tried to help them understand Steve's psyche better, and how people like us are, but we're not normal people. My dad was on the 10 most wanted FBI list for nine fucking years. - The older Paddock surfaced in Springfield, Oregon in the late 1970s, under the Erickson alias, after escaping from prison where he'd been serving a 20-year sentence for robbing a bank. - There was no trail. He's never done all the shit that your normal dumb fuck who goes out and shoot some people does. Steve was a very smart guy, I was in business with him I mean, we ended up with a bunch of million dollars. Oh, working our way up from a duplex in North Hollywood to 110-unit apartment building in Meskil, Texas. He was retired and then lived playing freaking video poker, when he was 40 years old. He started in Reno because he was a much bigger fish in a littler pond. He'd say "Here, here's a hundred thousand dollars, "I'm gonna play." "Here's a nice room for you, "and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." Whatever they call their fancy shit club. He wasn't doing it to get any richer, he was doing it 'cause you get to hang out in the hotel and it's nice. And the people bring you drinks, and they bring you a nice fat shrimps, and you get to eat in really good restaurants. The goal was to gamble effectively enough to pay for all that stuff, so it didn't cost him anything. At Atlanta's, we took over the whole top floor because he brought my whole extended family there for a week, 'cause he had a bazillion points, and he knew it was coming to an end there, 'cause they had started crunching him down a little bit, and they pushed him out of Reno by just cutting off his comps and stuff. - There was one place where the average person could come, and they were treated like Kings. ♪ Las Vegas, Las Vegas ♪ - The mob wanted people to fly to some shit hole in the desert to spend their hard earned money. John and Jane Q Citizen making $30,000 a year would come to Las Vegas, earn $3,000 and lose it. They got great rooms comped and they got free drinks. ♪ Las Vegas, no one does it better. ♪ - Las Vegas was the last resort, it was like tombstone territory where old Outlaws go to die. The mob was real generous with everything, they gave the rooms away, they gave the drinks away. Just making money on the gambling table. Everybody kinda knew which mobster ran which joint. - This is the Royal Resort, now it used to be called Joseline's Royal casino, this was my dad's joint. And we'd come here and hang out after school, we'd do our homework at the bar, unlimited Shirley Temples and grilled cheeses. I grew up in a casino in Las Vegas. - Food and rooms and all that was just seen as the service to keep the machines turning. And you always felt welcome, even if you were poor. 'Cause we were all poor when we walked out the door for the most part, right? - You could lose all the money that you had, and you'd be comped, dinners and breakfasts, and rooms, and everybody was a high roller, when they came to Vegas. You'd come back here the next year, and blow all your money again. - The main crime was skimming. And the mobsters protected their turf to the extent that they didn't wanna draw attention, and the street criminals, drew attention. So they stopped and got 'em out of town, they put them in a shallow grave over in San Bernardino County. The old mob didn't allow street crime. - When the mob ran that town, people didn't lock their doors at night, it was considered to be a safe town back then. - Mobsters were skimming money off the casinos, and not paying taxes on that money. But in the 1980s, they started getting caught. - So you're starting to see a transition from the old kind of mobsters with the bent noses to suits running the place. - This is a totally integrated balanced resort. - The man who turned up the wattage in Las Vegas, is casino mogul, Steve Wynn. He set off a building boom in the 1980s that turned a bunch of gambling joints into an international tourist spot. Steve Wynn was the reason why Vegas is the way it is, he's responsible for it. When he sold the Golden Nugget and he built the Mirage, he changed Las Vegas. - Tropical setting with lagoons an atrium, tall palms. And you can see the showroom where Siegfried and Roy are gonna perform. - Today is a great day, a dream come true, the Mirage. - It just exploded. That's where the template for the current Las Vegas casinos evolved from. Las Vegas started to change. - They're getting rid of the small, independent owned casinos, going more into the corporate world. Big money was starting to run the town as opposed to the people that lived there. That's when you started seeing the implosions, - All that old stuff had come down and all the new stuff was coming up. Monte Carlo, Bellagio, all these new mega resorts. In the mid 90s, Las Vegas was going through this family-friendly phase and MGM over here, they decided to build a theme park on the back of the property. - It was starting to become a place you could bring your kids to. And then they realised all these people here, spending time with their kids are not in the casinos. Tear down the theme park, build more hotels. MGM Resorts International owns over a dozen of these properties, and Caesars owns most of the rest of what's left. And then outside of that, you have like the Wynn, the Cosmo and the Venetian. Those are owned by other people, but for the bulk of it, you just have MGM Resorts International and Caesars basically own all of this. The corporations took over Vegas, and it went from having on 880,000 people in 1990 to around one-and-a-half million by the year 2000. - The population almost doubled, and the money did a lot more than double, it just blew up. MGM started taking over the town. They bought the Mirage in 2000 and Steve Wynn took some of that $4.4 billion the Mirage sold for and opened The Wynn. - I'm Steve Wynn, and this is my new hotel, the only one I've ever signed my name to. And that's where Stephen Paddock became a regular. Frequent visitor once or twice a month. He's been staying in Las Vegas since 06. So, you know, we're talking about 11 years. - I've got a picture of Steve holding a $250,000 check signed by Steve Wynn. - When Steve came in, they said, "Oh, we've got your room, Mr. Paddock." - Vegas is notorious for luring you in, they will give you the hottest chicks, they will give you front row tickets, they'll give you the meals, all of that stuff. - When Mandalay Bay opened up the second tower, which was called The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, 2004. That's when I started working there. Stephen Paddock was well known on Mandalay Bay property. Sometimes he was moody, never mean to any of us bell people, just man of very few words. He was a high limit gambler. And he would actually come down and shake our hand and he was very personable. And that's when Stephen Paddock was on a real good winning streak when Richardson owned the company. He would win. I've got texts from him where he goes, they're calling my name for the fourth time, I'm sending Mary Lou up to get the shit because he got like five of the six things in the drawing for a car. And he had three quarters of the tickets in the drum. When he needed to burn points, he'd go to their store and buy a bunch of crap, you know, $350 sunglasses and $450 watches and then I'd get a box of shit. - As long as you got cash, you get into jets, you get the dinners, you're getting the 82 Pertrus, that's 20,000 a bottle. - TV's would show up at my mom's house. He did kick their ass, he used to win plenty. He did very well gambling, he knew what he was doing. That all ended, once MGM bought Mandalay Bay. Changes came immediately. We got lights bulbs for a Christmas gift, but they taxed us $17 on our cheque for it, so it wasn't a gift. We bought a light bulb for our Christmas gift. MGM International tightened up a whole bunch of policies and procedures and they started pinching the high limit gambler a little more and stopped fulfilling comps. They didn't make any money on him. So, what would they do? They would say, "Oh, we're sorry, Steve, but there's gonna be three X points tonight from midnight to six, but you don't get the three X points." And then when they broke the deal, he was pissed. The deal's a deal. - They were jerking them around a lot. They were lying to him about his comps. I've seen this countless times with other gamblers, high limit gamblers, would lose 500,000 and leave pissed off. So, Mandalay Bay would have this recovery team. Man, they put their ChapStick on and start kissing a lot of ass. Smoothing things over for him, losing the amount of money he lost. And they would promise him all these comps. Free weekend stay at a nice suite. And then you got me, the bell guy goes in to go get his free room. And all of a sudden hotel tower's fully committed, which means there aren't any rooms available, but they can sell him a upgraded room. This high limit gambler's thinking, the casino host emails me two days ago, confirming my comps. I get here and I have nothing and I've already paid a hundred dollars for valet, I've have given the bell guy, 20 guys to escort me in. Now I gotta pay extra $500 for my room. That's supposed to be comped. Working as a bell person for over 13 years, I saw it continuously thinking And when they get there, nothing is comped. This deceptive practice comes from the very top. MGM and Mandalay Bay, they definitely wanna hide all these tricks they pull on gamblers. They're there to make a winner, a loser. - He wasn't as successful in gambling, as he had been in previous years. A substantial portion of his wealth had diminished and that could have been a contributing factor. When you blow your cash in Vegas, you go from Mr C, Mr. P, Mr. G, to get the fuck out. They don't want you to know more. You're cast aside. As soon as you blow your cash, you can't get a fricking French fry. - Steve gambled $1.6 million at the Mandalay in the week before he did this. And I've got the last four years of his W-2 Gs. I've got tax records that show that when he came in at the Mandalay and they wouldn't give him the room he wanted, he said he sat down and gambled a million dollars. So they'd give him the room he wanted. Violence behind gambling losses, is not something that doesn't happen. He was really, really angry with the gaming industry. - I think he wanted revenge for the money he lost at Mandalay Bay. To leave MGM international at full. - He's still got two houses. He's got all these guns and ammo. I mean, this is not some guy that lost a million dollars and decided to go home and pack up his guns. He planned this. For us to release a timeline and today, we have one. 10:05, the first shots fired by the suspect. 10:17 officers arrive on the 32nd floor. 10:18 security officer tells the LVN PD officers, he was shot and gives the exact location of this room. 11:20 officers entered the suspect's room. They observed the suspect down on the ground. - This just in, MGM says that Metro's timeline of the shooting is not correct. - I am very well aware of the MGM statement provided yesterday. I agree with their statement. It's the timeline associated with the original shot and Mr. Campos has changed. - Metro now says Campos was shot closer to 10:05, aligning with the MGM's timetable released yesterday, not the six minute gap given earlier this week by police. - Jesus Campus was given an amount somewhere in the neighbourhood of $300,000 for his silence. He was also gifted two condos and those come to the tune of about $2,500 a month each. So, that's $5,000 a month that is gifted to him in the form of a residence. And that came about the time that he was supposed to be on five different television shows, doing interviews. - Suddenly he cancelled shortly before the interviews were to occur. Instead, he just showed up on the Ellen Show, with a cane and a limp. - He shot through this door, right? - Yeah, from behind the door. I don't know how he was shooting. - Out of all the investigative reporters that we have that could ask hard questions. I mean, Ellen DeGeneres, who happens to have a whole line of slot machines that are sponsored by the MGM resorts. - Wow, so and I mean, it really, he saved your life and he saved also the woman that came out of the door and came to the hallway. - You stopped everything and MGM Resorts and Mandalay Bay did everything right. She just threw him soft balls and it's like, - There was a metal bracket holding the door in place. - Right, so what we're talking about here, Okay, so- - That's the only damn interview that he did was on a TV talk show. - You just want this to be over. So, you're talking about it now and then you're not gonna talk about it again. - And she had managed to keep him out of contact with any media. And they made sure that instead of hearing the facts from his mouth, we heard the facts from their mouths. - And tonight, we are getting a better idea of what may happen to the One October shooting site. - MGM resorts in Metro are reportedly talking about the construction of a SWAT building, on a portion of that site. - You would think it'd be a conflict of interest to give the police department that's investigating you such an enormous gift. - The area known as Las Vegas Village, is valued at about $38 million. - We know we're under investigation by you guys, but we're just gonna give you this humongous gift that's worth over $30 million. - This entire event and investigation happened in an election year where Joe Lombardo was campaigning to continue to be the sheriff. He raised over a million dollars. - You have Las Vegas Boulevard stand up and say, "This is where we're gonna put our money because this is who we want to have elected." - And then they go more than a million dollars into sheriff, Joe Lombardo. So nobody else is gonna win if they try to run behind them because there is a power machine behind them. And it's the gaming industry. All the hotels want him because he's gonna do what they tell him to do. That they're unsafe by staying at one of our hotels. - I stopped even watching the press conferences, because I felt like they were a farce. I felt like they weren't giving us any information. It was an election year and it was just camera time for Lombardo and his friends. - I wanna thank sheriff Lombardo for your leadership and leading us through this terrible, terrible day, thank you. - Thank you, appreciate that. Thank you sheriff, I wanna first off begin by thanking the sheriff. - Oh, they were fighting each other, man. The camera lens wasn't wide enough to get all these people in front of it. - Mainly were trying to stay out of the way because you don't want to turn a personal tragedy into a political event. - Almost every press conference, you saw one figure and that was Steve Sisolak. You didn't see Governor Sandoval there. You didn't see even Carolyn Goodman, the Mayor there. But you always saw Steve Sisolak in the background. He was on every national television set, getting face time, using this as a springboard for his political campaign. But Steve Sisolak, will fight for Nevadan women. - So, I support totally the women's right to choose. - And you had politicians grand standing on this Vegas Strong movement. Used it as an elevator to get elected. And then they weren't following through with it. - I'm a journalist with the Las Vegas Tribune. And I tried reaching out to the Vegas Strong Resiliency Centre. Couldn't get anybody on the phone. They wouldn't answer emails. I couldn't get any answers on where this money had gone, if the money had gone anywhere, - I was told I was gonna get back a certain amount of money. And I didn't, you know. My kids suffered, they didn't get a Christmas. My son's birthday followed up. He didn't get any birthday presents. And it was definitely a rough rest of the year for me. I felt helpless and there was nothing I could do to support my family. It's definitely taken a toll in changing my life as a mother. And I felt like I let my kids down. I do, I feel like I let them down, but they understand and they get it. And thankfully my kids are very, very great. They're amazing children and they get it and they're still there for me. There's a lot of broken people that haven't got the help that they needed. My manager's daughter was there. She was injured, she had to go back into a wheelchair after it happened. She couldn't stand up for work. She was a chef at the SLS and they fired her 'cause she couldn't work. She lost her home, she got a divorce. - You see, they got the Vegas Strong on the firetruck. Then you got medic West. The whole town was all in and we all got bamboozled. - But I went up to get coffee in the window of Dunkin' Donuts. And they were selling Vegas Strong t-shirts out of the window. - The people that were victimised continue to be victimised because they have not received the funds. I couldn't provide for my family anymore. We lost everything, you know. My kids didn't wanna be home. I had no cable, no money, and I had no Christmas, I had nothing. My daughter didn't wanna be home because I was self medicating. I was heavily drinking and I would never, ever allow myself to behave that way ever prior to October 1. I'm okay, one minute and the next thing you know, I'm not. It can be any little thing that can just trigger it. And I texted my sister, bye and she just told me to pray. And to just hang in there. It's not anything, you know, you'll never know what happened back there. And you will never know this feeling that I feel, you know, it's dark. And I said, "Bye." And I turned off my phone. Then 15 minutes later, and somebody was banging on my door. The cops came and they admitted me into the hospital. And I got put on this mid-level 2000 suicidal hold at St. Rose, just wanted to end my life. And it's just so hard, when I see pictures at home, they're not home. It's hard, there's been zero help at all. Nobody wants to do anything. I've reached out for help, many times. - Sisolak started a GoFundMe. You promised, to account for every penny. Millions donated from people all over the world. Money unaccounted for the Vegas victims shooting. There's never been any distribution lists for the Vegas shot funds and who's receiving what money. - Our media is pretty silent about the whole thing. They're letting people forget about it. And I don't think we're willing to let people forget about that. - There's always somewhere that a politician can blame. And Sisolak will say that while I was the fundraiser, but I'm not responsible for distributing. Well, the hell you're not. Because if you're not going to distribute the money to the victims, why collect it? I think the community saw October 1st as a tragedy, but Sisolak, he saw it as an opportunity. - Every time there was an event that involved Vegas Strong, he was there walking around, making certain that he got face time. That it never showed before. And I'm really proud, with Las Vegas. - I saw him jumping in front of cameras to show his support and to be real emotional about this horrific tragedy that happened. But I didn't see him dispersing any money. He collected a lot of money. - He raised over $10 million. And here it is on my building. It's over 10 feet long and it's up there on main street. I've been a business owner in downtown Las Vegas for over 10 years. And I just, I love my community. And I don't know where that money's at, but it's not getting to the people that need it. If the victims aren't getting it, the victims are missing their rent, they're missing their mortgage payments. - Eventually the funds were distributed, but they weren't distributed at the time that the people needed it. They needed those funds early on. That's when the bills are racking up, that's when the rent's due, the car payments due, the insurance is due. That is when they needed the help. They didn't get it. While the Campaign raised over $10 million, less than $20,000 were distributed to the victims in the first five months. And that's kind of when it became clear to me that it was just another campaign, it was just another slogan to make people see the city in the best light possible. MGM emailed me shortly after the shooting. And they said that they realised what happened that night was horrible. And they'd like to offer me a 10 % coupon on my next day at one of their properties, because obviously a 10 % discount in a hotel room is going to just make everything go away and make all the victims forget the hell that we suffered through that night. - Sheriff, when did he check into the hotel? And what date did he check into the hotel? - To the best of my recollection, we have information on the 25th. I had told you previously, the 28th, You got the timeline changing three times only because people were calling out things. - ...That have been obtained from the valet security system. - Ma'am, that's not how we conduct this service, okay? If I'm presented with a question. - Timeline change? Because the FBI... - That's not how I conduct press conferences, ma'am. - Well have the official timelines changed. - Please stop asking your question. - He got really angry, and that lady was never allowed in the room again. - And then shortly after they did change the timeline that matched the independent journalist's findings. - Sometime late October, I was here, and I noticed that there's a camera right here, mounted on the outside of this business. And I was wondering, if that actually caught any of the footage from people coming through here. So I asked if I could take a look at it, and see if I could access the information. And next thing you know, the video's on Fox news. - Two men drag would appears to be a fallen victim into the parking lot. The business owner who possesses this tape, or even asked to see it. - You would think that the LVMPD, and the FBI would want every piece of evidence, that they could possibly get their hands on. - We have hundreds of agents, covering every facet of this investigation. Nothing will be overlooked. Sheriff Lombardo promised a comprehensive investigation into leaked images of the Stephen Paddock crime scene. And we still haven't received the results of this comprehensive investigation. So I decided to call into a radio show in which, Sheriff Lombardo was answering questions. - You have a department with over a $600 million budget, yet they couldn't figure out who leaked images from a cell phone. Imagine that. In my opinion, sheriff Lombardo is lying. And it's certainly not the first lie, Or the first time he's deceived the public. - Is Las Vegas a safe community? Yes. Is it a safe tourist community? Yes. - During Sheriff Lombardo's reelection campaign, a violent crime rate report was released, which showed that the violent crime rate in Las Vegas had been reduced. When in fact it didn't take into account, the 58 that we lost during 1 October. And there was also two other homicides that it also didn't take into account. So you had 60 homicides that were not included in this report. So the crime rate actually was the highest, in Las Vegas history. If you include the 60 that they so conveniently left out. - My name's Doug Poppa, former police officer, Deputy Sheriff and Criminal Investigator. I spent about 20 years in the casino industry, as a director of security. And I'm also a journalist. SWAT officer Levi Hancock got on the radio and said, "We have an accidental discharge." But none of that was released publicly. Joe Lombardo didn't say anything about the accidental discharge. So I broke the story about a month later, in the Baltimore Post Examiner, then they later came out and said there was an accidental discharge. - It kind of exposed the fact that he hadn't been entirely truthful with the public. And that was when a lot of people started asking questions, about why we weren't being given the whole truth. Accidental discharge, excuse me? - Casinos tell him, you know, to jump, and he asks how high? - 'Cause he's a paid puppet. He's a liar. - There is no conspiracy between the FBI, between LVMPD, and the MGM. Nobody is attempting to hide anything. Yeah, can't trust this. - When you try to hide it, it breeds conspiracy theories, it breeds people saying, why is he lying? He's a liar, they're covering this up, covering that up. If there was a conspiracy, it was conspiracy to cover up negligence and incompetence. Even one of the stories even the title was, is Joe Lombardo a liar, incompetent, or both? The word incompetence has been brought forward, and I am absolutely offended with that characterization. Shut the public out of the information, and the story just started to go away. And then shortly after that, you get the radio encryption where the public's no longer allowed to listen, to the police scanners out here. - On January 23rd, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, blocked the public's ability to listen, to what's happening in the city. - They were getting called out on a daily basis for the inconsistencies, and they kept changing the stories. And I think probably all of that was based on, the fact that people could check up by listening to the radio. You can compare it to the stories, you could see for yourself that they weren't telling the truth. Decrypt the police scanners. Those are our public airwaves. - Major news outlets have filed lawsuits, asking law enforcement to turn over police records This is according to the LA Times, which is one of the plaintiffs. - Over a half a dozen media outlets got together, put a lawsuit together to sue the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, over them refusing to release these documents that the court ordered them to release. - The Supreme Court ruled that all information was supposed to be given out immediately. So Sheriff Lombardo decided to charge, nearly half a million dollars to get this information. Another legal manoeuvre on his part to delay the release of the information. - A Las Vegas judge has ruled that Las Vegas Metro Police can not charge the media high fees, to get records on the 1 October shooting. At the behest of the court system, we were mandated to provide body worn camera footage, and document footage as part of a public information request. - The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department started releasing data, but only bits at a time. Sheriff Lombardo cherry picked which information he wanted to have come out before the election, and which information was going to come out after the election. - And there's not the new sheriff in town. - I'm going to declare victory at this point, all right? Joe Lombardo was reelected as Las Vegas Metro PD's sheriff in June of 2018. It wasn't until after that, that he chose to release videos of his officers cowering in the hallway outside of Steven Paddock's room instead of immediately entering to stop the possible threat, of more people being shot out of that hotel room window. Newly released video shows Las Vegas police waiting in the hallway at the Mandalay Bay hotel, continues to murder people below. - Holy fuck. - He shot his gun. Oh my God. He got shot through the leg - People were getting killed, and this coward stayed on the 31st floor, and not one attempt was made to reach the 32nd floor. - Lives could have been saved if they had taken action. Absolutely. They had a team of armed individuals that did nothing but cower while the shots were going on. - 58 people died that night and the coward cop who could have done something, they fire him, but they don't tell anybody about it. I found out about it, and I did the story on it. There were about 30 police officers with shotguns and ARS, and all kinds of handguns, and they sit, for over an hour on the 32nd floor. - SWAT entered the room 11:20. - One of the SWAT officers discharged his weapon in the room. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. They went into the room, and they completely destroyed the crime scene, which is something you don't do. But they turned over Paddock's body, they ransack the room. That goes against any standard police protocol, anywhere in this country. - They handled the crime scene like a bunch of incompetent boobs. Because they compromised the biggest crime scene in American history at that point. - Lombardo never brought this out, until I broke the story, and was followed up by some news media after. - He would not have won the election, in my opinion, had this information been released, in the time frame it should have been released. - In the footage that the LVMPD was forced to release, you have these body cam videos, where you hear officers directly saying, turn your cameras off, make sure your cameras are off. - Why do you not want what's about to happen to be on video? It's one of the many crazy things I think there's something more to this shooting, than what's been disclosed. You've got police officers that say that they heard gunshots from different locations. - I'm telling you right now there's more than one shooter. Dude, we saw multiple muzzle flashes coming out that window. - Are you sure it wasn't just one? - No, because it was two distinctive sounds. - Hey, somebody said there could be as many as three. - We're getting about 10 shots per second, during that interval, which would be about twice as fast as my observation of what an individual could pull a trigger manually. So this would be consistent with a gun that has the bump stock. The gunshots themselves are all very similar in their amplitude. There seemed to be these volleys of many, many shots, and then a gap of some number of seconds before the shooting starts again. - There's gun shots right here. - Stephen Paddock fired 13, 14 volleys. - Why would there be instances during the volleys where it would stop shooting? If you have multiple shooters, there's no reason to stop shooting. - They would be firing simultaneously, and there would be overlapping volleys of these different shots. And so we would expect the recordings would have a barrage of overlapping gunfire, rather than these distinct individual shots. The fact that we've got the architectural features of Las Vegas with the different buildings nearby. Lots of concrete and sidewalks and so forth, that tends to lead to a lot of acoustical reflections. And so the recording of a gun, fired in that environment is going to have lots of this reverberation present. It's like a sound wave going across the venue, and then bouncing off of a building. So it sounds like it's coming from two directions. - That can sound like there's many more shooters, just because you're hearing one sound, echoed several times from these different surfaces. - I gotta go, there's more people. - Go, go, go, go, go. - People were saying there were shootings down the strip. What was really happening, was someone was in a hotel, and some person ran in with blood all over them, and someone asked him, what happened? And they said there was a shooting. Next thing you know, they're calling 911, there's a shooting at New York, New York. - And there's a shooting at Bellagio. - There's a shooting at Tropicana. - All because these people are interpreting what they're seeing as a shooting happening right then and there in front of them. When it's just a person running in the door, that's bloodied from running from this event. - The officers don't know what's happening. - They're trying to investigate and find out what's going on, and if somebody runs up to them and says, hey, you know, there's a shooting at the Tropicana, or there's something going on at New York, New York, they're not in a position to judge how valid that claim is. They're going to have to now report that back. - I've gone through the recordings and observed the characteristics of the wave forms, and from the examples I've looked at here, there is a single shooter involved in this incident. I have uncut footage from 7:00 a.m. that morning until 12:00 p.m. the next day, from six different camera angles. The attorneys asked me to analyse this footage for them. I can zoom in on any of these camera views that I want plus combine that with all the audio footage that I've gotten off of all of the cell phone cameras The shooting happened from one location right there, from that room right there. I'm 99 % sure, that Steve did this by himself, completely and totally. Accumulating the guns, getting the guns in the hotel. He tipped some kid a hundred bucks, and he took 'em up on a little gold trolley. - When you fire a weapon, what you're doing is you're causing a minor explosion inside of a barrel. So, that minor explosion inside the barrel creates transferred out into the barrel. Then you can see that the curtain just because of the ejected casings or possibly him leaning the rifle against it actually was burned. That's what's going to happen, when you put that many rounds through a barrel. A hundred rounds through a barrel is gonna heat it up enough to where you can't touch it. That's why he's wearing gloves. So the most efficient way to handle it, instead of changing out barrels, is to change out weapons. It's a lot more expensive, but he had the money, he spent over $100,000 in weapons alone. So Steven, when he fired the weapons, he would expend all the ammunition, drop the weapon into a makeshift pit that he had in the middle of the room. And then he would start firing again with a new weapon. - This is AR10, that Paddock used, shooting at the fuel tank. Fuel tanks are made to take abuse. We're shooting at 50 yards here, and you can't put a dent in that steel. So imagine a thousand yards, trying to penetrate a piece of steel. This is gonna be the AR15. All right, this is gonna be the one that he shot the people with. See how fast and accurate you can be. Really super easy to shoot. Doesn't take much skill. Having an outdoor open venue with that many people in one location, fences all around it. They're kind of corralled in there. Yeah, they're sitting ducks. I mean, it was like shooting fish in a barrel. - The FBI put out a three page comprehensive report, I've had in custody petty larceny reports that were over three pages. That was a misdemeanor offense, with one person being arrested. I can't tell you, the absurdity of that from, if you look at when Parkland had their shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 kids were murdered. They put out a 400 page comprehensive report. And they studied every aspect of that thing to prevent it from happening again, to find out what things were missed. - These are the things you could slam on the desk. You know what I mean? It caused an earthquake. But this is just a little pamphlet, you know, just a hey, this is it, we're done, goodbye, go away. - If they don't do a proper investigation, then it could happen again. And that's what makes people less safe. - When Sheriff Lombardo holds his final news conference, there are less than a handful of reporters who show up. Small crowd today. - The Vegas shooting went from being the biggest casualty event of the year to being a small news conference set, that even the local journalists didn't show up for. - Today, we will release our final criminal investigative report on the 1 October mass casualty shooting. I know and believe there was only one suspect, who killed 58 people and injured hundreds more. We have considered as investigation complete. I hope that the conclusion of this investigation provides some answers and some closure. What we have been able to answer are the questions of who, what, when, where, and how. What we have not been able to definitively answer is the why Stephen Paddock committed this act. - They have to say no motive Hey, you know, and because that's not really good for business, I don't think. And now it's part of this spin machine. - The actual cover up was their incompetence and their negligence in the handling of the investigation. The destruction of the crime scene, turning over his body, ransacking the room before the crime scene analysts went in there. - Then you have the accidental discharge in Paddock's room. Then they tried to cover that up. The fact that it took over 70 minutes to get into Paddock's room. And that the officer that could've stopped it all, basically chickened out. There's nothing justifiable about what he did. Stephen Paddock was a monster. But what do you call a company that sues the victims in a case like this, where 58 people died. - MGM resorts is suing the victims of last year's mass shooting in Las Vegas, claiming that it has no liability for the deadly attack. MGM is asking a judge to dismiss any lawsuits against it, stemming from the October 1st shooting. I was just, you know, I was like, why the fuck would they sue the victims, that were just there during a concert in their property? They were getting shot at from a hotel room, that's a part of their property. - Now they are being sued by one of the largest companies in America for getting shot. - Shameful, disgusting, outrageous. Those are some of the common words people used along with a as it was trending on Twitter. - In more than 30 years of practise, this is the most reprehensible conduct I've ever seen by a defendant. - MGM says in part quote, "Years of drawn out litigation and hearings the community, and those still healing." - That is the biggest, fattest lie I've ever heard. - If you make the public think that you're suing people or their families who are dead or seriously injured, to me, that's a PR disaster. - As an attorney, I tried to look than maybe a lot of victims do. The MGM legal strategy heavily relied upon a Federal Act that was passed shortly after 9/11. It's called the Safety Act. And the Safety Act states that that private company is not liable for what happened at the terrorist attack, as long as they have hired a security team that has been previously approved by the Department of Homeland Security. Many people have filed suit against MGM. Instead of having to fight each of these lawsuits individually, MGM decided to file one lawsuit against all the people that had sued MGM and all the people that MGM thought would sue MGM and make a statement that they were not liable. Who were at fault here. They not only named the estate of people who were killed that night and victims, but they also named the children of people who were killed that night. Some as young as age six. So, they sued six year olds, in an effort to clear their name. The brief literally stated that, we the victims who were affected by this who were injured by this, who were killed by this, remained in the line of fire. We were inside MGM's venue. The venue that didn't have enough exits. The venue where bottlenecks at those few exits were occurring. The venue in which they have shone a spotlight on us, so that he had a better view. The venue where I watched a woman die long before she knew that there even was a line of fire. She didn't even know that a shooting was going on. And now her parents are told, "Oh, your daughter's dead. Well, it was her own fault. She remained in the line of fire." MGM and Mandalay Bay claimed that they didn't know that this could happen. Yet years prior, Mandalay Bay had discovered A guest had brought many guns. He was aiming those guns down the strip. Thankfully he was stopped. And the fact that in their brief, they say they had no way of knowing, is a pure lie. Just goes to show how much disregard they have for the victims of what happened on October 1st. - On October 1st of 2018, the one year anniversary, MGM had said that they were going to darken the marquees. You could come out and have a candle if you want and memorialise the fallen, you know. It was a one year anniversary. So, I'm out there and I'm live on Facebook and from the Mandalay Bay and we're waiting and waiting and waiting. There's all these other people around me and they didn't do anything. Layering on the music, was this real upbeat song, happy and you know, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was like, "God, what kind of slap "in the face is this?" Day's after the city marked the somber second anniversary of the Route 91 Festival shooting, there's a settlement between victims and MGM resorts. - They were trying to hide behind the Safety Act. An Act in which the Federal Government, would have actually paid out all of these claims. And because it wasn't ruled a terrorist act by the FBI or Homeland Security, they couldn't use the Safety Act. This settlement will provide fair compensation for thousands of victims and their family. Las Vegas lawyer, Robert Eglet of Eglet Adams represents about 2,500 of the 4,400 victims in the case. - The total settlement amount is expected to be approximately $735 to $800 million. Now as stated and this needs to be made clear, MGM Resorts has insurance coverage for $751 million. - MGM is only on the hook for about $49 million. That's a slap on the wrist. - What MGM has done here through this process and through this mediation represents the highest standard of corporate citizenship I have ever seen. Last year, I was the loudest voice in the country saying negative things about MGM when they sued a number of the victims. In more than 30 years of practise, this is the most reprehensible conduct I have ever seen by a defendant. - Robert Eglet, attorney for over 2,500 claimants in this case, stated that the $800 million settlement would be good for everyone. But what he didn't say is that he stands to get over a hundred million dollars in this case, making him the true winner. - And as a lifelong Nevadan, I cannot tell you how proud I am that MGM is a Nevada company. They have made me the most loyal customer they'll ever have. - And now they're the most wonderful corporation he's ever seen. And he went from their largest critic to becoming their biggest ass kisser. Is he their lawyer or ours? Because he sure as hell wasn't acting like it. - Keeping this out of the courts by settling with the victims, allows MGM to hide the fact that their greed and incompetence may be part of why this happened. They were the ones with the terrible security, allowing him to take 20 plus weapons up into the room. Their inactions is what caused a lot of the deaths that we see in this case. The failure on the security, failure on surveillance... The former MGM director of surveillance told me over 200 cameras were off at the time in the Mandalay Bay shooting. October 1st, Mandalay Bay had over 200 cameras not working. - It's security negligence, cameras were out, they were untrained in some of the equipment and the protocols and how to do the different systems. And that came out in their reports to the police. And I did stories on that. So, there was no way this was gonna go to a courtroom. That's why they agreed to the settlement. I think that there was a clear intent that this would never go to trial. And I had a problem with that 'cause from day one, I said, "The truth needs to be told." - If we did go to trial, all of this would come out and that's exactly what they didn't want. They chose Jennifer Togliatti. This is a judge who stepped down a year early from her retirement to actually go work for a company called ARM. And when she goes to work there, what is their first case that she's handed? Oh, wow, look, it's an MGM case. And who is her father? MGM's Vice President, Head of Security, Safety and Surveillance. None other than George Togliatti. There is a conflict of interest there because her dad is the VP of Security. Instead of going that one more year for retirement. Judge Togliatti, I believe, was brought in to save MGM and her father's ass. How did they not say, "We should not do this." They didn't do it because they wanted the fix in. Period, the end. The fix has always been in in Vegas. That's what they do. It's ridiculous. It can only happen in Vegas. - Las Vegas is a big facade. The whole city is an illusion. And the person that's getting in the way of the illusion of selling this case to the American public, is Roger Kenis. This is a claimant who actually ran back in and tried to save the lives of others. And this is a slap in his face. And he pulled out of the settlement. He is the single person that we know of that opted out. We never even got the damn truth and that's all I wanted. That's why I opted out. Because no amount of money is gonna buy the truth. And somebody had to stand up to 'em. People need to be held accountable, so this can never happen again. - It's a twisted, twisted tale of corruption in Vegas. - It's an incestuous thing that happens in Vegas. They all protect each other like brothers and sisters. This case should have been in the billions. - You have a case of someone trying to put on the illusion that everyone is happy. Were the lawyers and MGM and that's it. The take was $800 million and divided up with around 4,500 people. And it's not a lot of money. Neither is the 49 million that MGM, a corporation who grosses over 10 billion a year has to actually pay out out of pocket. So MGM won. But the victims in this case lost. - I do love my town, but I'm starting to see the reality of things since October 1st on what Vegas really is. - After you lived there a little bit, you start seeing the dark side of Vegas, the sinister side of Vegas, and it has nothing to do with cocaine and hookers. It has to do with all the greed. - I had been at the City Hall, parked, and I saw a bunch of what looked like sticks behind a screen of a fence. So I went over there to look, and it was the crosses from the Las Vegas massacre. There were thrown in a giant pile in the sun, behind a dumpster. And that's where they sit all year. And then Greg Zanis comes into town and he displays them at the Las Vegas welcome sign. Today's the second year anniversary and I'm down here letting these families know that I remembered... This year, what happened was the County asked him to move all the crosses to be displayed for only two hours at the County Government Centre where no one would have ever seen them. And they only wanted them displayed for two hours. - It's the right thing to do to spend one full day out of my life, to remember what happened to here two years ago. - He didn't back down. He decided that he was going to display the crosses on the astro turf. And then the County came in and said that they thought it was a pedestrian safety issue. - And as you see, there goes one of the crosses, their families are taking them. And that's why I'm here. We're gonna try to give all of these out today. - And they want it to go away and it shouldn't. We should never let those crosses be forgotten. Nobody wanted the 1 October event to happen. But when it did, I think there's people who found a way to make it work for them. To turn a tragedy into an opportunity. 1 October was almost like a show, a Vegas show. And once the stars of that show got what they wanted, they didn't care anymore and neither did Vegas. Keep the money dropping off the tables, keep the slot machines going and keep the registers ringing. - $50 billion worth of tourism that comes into our community. The hotels are full, the occupancy rate is great, the prices are reasonable, nothing's better than Las Vegas. - It is hot here, is all I can tell you. We just are trying to keep having enough cranes out there. Labourers, carpenters, we're just booming. - Steel on the Raider stadium is like four months behind on construction, waiting for more steel to be forged in China. That's how crazy it is, you know. The world can't produce steel fast enough to get us our steel, to build the new Vegas. And they just keep building, and everything looks like this. This is what we see everywhere we go every day. - The gambling industry is bouncing back. So evidently they're doing it right. - Vegas took a hit, but it bounced back pretty damn quick. It's an endless supply of money. People still are getting on those planes coming to Vegas. - 50 million passengers travelled through Vegas in 2019, the most in a year ever. - March of 2020, the pandemic happens. Coronavirus shuts down the entire country. - Makeshift morgues are being built to handle the crush of bodies. The usually packed Vegas strip, now a ghost town. This, after several employees on the strip tested positive for COVID-19. It has been more than a month since Las Vegas was shut down by the coronavirus with the number of confirmed cases continuing to climb though in Nevada. - You've got over a million people who have been infected by this virus in the United States. The death toll in the United States, from coronavirus now stands at 57,000. - Today at the president's briefing, we were told again that the number of American deaths could reach as high as 200,000. - Las Vegas mayor, Carolyn Goodman, is calling the shutdown of the state total insanity. This shutdown has become one of total insanity. - She also compared COVID 19 to the flu and other viruses. Who died and made somebody, the consummate doctor? Open the city. - The most contagious contagion that we've seen in decades. And then you have a mayor who doesn't care. - 2.3 million people in Southern Nevada. And we've had 150 deaths. - Isn't that because of social distancing that you would have had far more without it? - How do you know until we have a control group? We offered to be a control group. So, here's Caroline Goodman offering the lives of the Vegas residents to be the control group. I offered to be a control group, and I was told by our statistician, you can't do that. And Anderson Cooper was sitting there in disbelief at the amount of crap that was spilling from this woman. - This is in China, this is Las Vegas Nevada. - Wow, okay, that's really ignorant. If you can't figure out how to do this safely. Why as mayor of a city that you are responsible for something that you have no plan for how it would be done safely? They'd better figure it out, that's their job. That's not the mayor's job. - Let me ask you, any social distancing? You don't believe that this is a... Of course, I believe there should be. Of course. How do you do that in a casino? That's up to them to figure out. You have people dropping dead all over Las Vegas and you have a mayor who doesn't care. All she cares about is cash, cash, cash, money, money, money. - We were not broken, and we need to get back to work. Just keep the registers ringing. Keep the slot machines dinging. Vegas is a money machine. It's a huge cash register about people's lives being lost. It was evidenced by what happened during the mass shooting where 58 people lost their lives, and it's evidenced by what Carolyn Goodman did on the CNN interview with Anderson Cooper. The deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history became one of the most forgotten. - Most of the American public barely remembers that it happened. That just shows you the power of money in Las Vegas. It's a town that was built by the mob, built on corruption, and with corporations in charge, it's just a different kind of corrupt. Vegas was a different town. I mean, don't get me wrong, the mob were no angels, these guys were savages. But when the town was less corporate, it was a much better town. - I think the challenge is now, what it should be and what it was. - Greed is what's ruining Las Vegas. Where else does that happen, where an entity would sue the victims because they dropped the ball? Only in Las Vegas. As far as I'm concerned.
