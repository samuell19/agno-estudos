The following is a presentation of HBO Sports. Here is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ! I remember, he walked out and he sat down in the chair, and you look at him, and you see this big smile on his face. After all he's been through, he's free. Here is the 7th annual All-American high school basketball team. 7-foot Lew Alcindor, New York's Power Memorial Academy. In three years, they have won three consecutives National Championships. The Milwaukee Bucks have won the most important draft pick in the history of the NBA. The prize, Lew Alcindor from UCLA. So it's Abdu al-Jabbar and Abdu al-Kareem, Kareem, sky hook. L.A. wins the title. There may be no athlete who was ever better suited for the game of basketball than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. There may be no man who's ever had a more complicated relationship with what it gave him. What is this all about ? You come up to me, you greet me, if you know who I am. When you ask for an autograph, that makes me something other than real. - We've got to split. - Don't split yet. You know, you can become bigger than what you really are. You know, I'm just a person just like any other person. KAREEM: MINORITY OF ONE He wanted to play football but he wasn't the football type. He was too tall and stringy, so we convinced him that he should try to play basketball. I didn't know anything about basketball at the time, I was a complete novice. The first time I dunked a basketball was in eighth grade. The ball hit the ground one time and I picked it up right in stride and took one step and dunked it. Everybody went nuts in the gym. The other team was unable to play for about two minutes. They couldn't get the ball over the half court. Everybody was stoked that they'd seen a school kid dunk a basketball. I was like, wow, that was neat. Still remember to this day, very vivid. He was this incredible young talent that we started hearing about when he was in eighth grade. There's this kid, there's this kid. And then this kid was Lew Alcindor. He was like the tallest eighth grader in the world and he was playing basketball in New York. By the time I got out of eighth grade, in the spring, I was 6-9. In May, I could walk through the house and not hit my head. In August, I was hitting the top of my head on the doorway. You're growing so quick. You're feeling a little awkward. You're feeling, how do you fit in ? What does it mean to be a misfit ? What does it mean to be pushed to the margins because you are towering ? He just couldn't get used to people walking up to him and commenting and making jokes about it. And I think that's when he started to get sort of standoffish. The tall kid who was the talk of the city lived in the upper Manhattan neighbourhood of Inwood. He'd been born Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr. in 1947. The only child of Cora, a seamstress, and Al, a police officer and part-time musician. My mom was from North Carolina, and had that southern graciousness and congeniality of the south. Being an only child really helped put her focus on me. My dad's background is from the West Indies, which is very Victorian, and kind of buttoned-up. My dad never displayed any emotion, he was always very wrapped up and hardly said anything. It affected me my whole life, I thought that was why people respected my dad. To Daddy. To Dad on Father's Day. My dad was a jazz musician. If he had had his way, he would have played in Count Basie's band, and he would have been the happiest guy in the world. The very first time I went to a jazz club, we went to see Art Blakely and the Jazz Messengers. My dad knew Art. Art was astounded, and he said, this is the kid you had in the stroller ? Because at that point, I was seven feet tall. While jazz clubs offered rare bonding opportunities with his father, among his peers, he found height wasn't the only thing that set him apart. You had an interesting thing in your book. When you first realized yourself that you were black. One of the kids had a Polaroid camera, they had some sort of party at class, and they took a picture of us all, and they passed it around, and I said, wait a minute, I'm the dark guy ! You didn't live in Harlem but that's where you went to hang out. Socialize... Socialize with the people. The kids that I knew real well, the kids that I went to school with, were Irish and Italian. And they didn't feel like socializing. They thought they were better than I was. So I socialized with Afro-Americans in my neighborhood and I'd go down to Harlem and play basketball. They told me being able to shoot the hook shot would really benefit me, as I was playing the center. So I started practicing hook shots all the time. The school custodian gave me the key to the gym. I would go in and work after-hours, I'd be the only one in the gym. When it came time for high school, every coach in the city dreamed of the seven-foot prodigy playing for them. Including Jack Donohue of Power Memorial, who offered him a scholarship and sold him on the Catholic school's strong academics, as well as its basketball program. When we went over to get uniforms for our very first game, they gave me a varsity uniform. And I didn't expect that. We played Erasmus Hall. They just whipped our ass, it was ridiculous. I'm 14 years old, but probably I was a lot closer to 12 than I was to 16. I'm in the locker room and I start crying. And I looked up and all the other guys on the team were looking at me like I had just stepped off of a spaceship. And I realized that I'm in the big world now, and I can't cry like a little boy. And from that point on, I always had my game face on, and I never gave away any emotional vulnerability to anybody. From that point on until I retired. High school basketball was as popular as college ball and as the Knicks were. You had sensational teams. And then Lew Alcindor comes on the scene. And we have a huge, literally, hero. Watching him play... He was a condor. His wingspan was so amazing. You read everything about him and heard everything about him and how teams were preparing for him using broomsticks and mops. If there was one high school basketball player in America that was known it was Lew Alcindor. Here is the seventh annual All-American high school basketball team. Seven foot, a quarter inch, Lew Alcindor. 15-year-old sophomore at New York's Power Memorial Academy, who reminds everybody of Wilt Chamberlain. It was 1963. At that point, every kid in America wanted to be on TV somehow, some way and I am on national TV. It was pretty amazing. My dad took pictures of the TV while I was on it and stuff like that. I was like a teenager whose dreams are coming true. His years at Power would be the start of a close relationship with his high school coach, but there was one night when even Jack Donohue would reveal an insensitivity that shook his impressionable star to the core. We were getting ready to go to play DeMatha. It was a big game, I wasn't really focused on the game, I was loafing. And Coach Donohue said that the way you're playing, lazy and not focused, someone would say that you were playing like the n-word. The stereotype for black people, that they were lazy and unmotivated. It affected me in that you never know who's going to call you that. He was the last person who I thought would ever call me that word. I was stunned by it. I didn't think that Jack had any kind of racist feelings. He did not say what he said because he was a racist, but because he was frustrated in not seeing me give my best effort, and wanted to shock me out of it, and he went too far. High school may not have shielded Alcindor from the realities of life, but uptown in Harlem, there was another court that offered a very different scene, and whole new kind of exposure. This is the original Rucker Park. People from all over Harlem would come to see the games on the weekends. There would be people totally choking the sidelines. I was lucky, being seven feet tall, I could see over everybody. He's tall as hell. That's not Kareem Abdul. I first met Wilt Chamberlain right here on the original Rucker court. I was in the eight grade. I was almost as tall as he was at that point. And it was finally my opportunity to meet my hero. At the time, Chamberlain played for the NBA's Philadelphia Warriors, but lived in New York. Soon, the towering presence was letting the seven-foot teenager tag alongside him around town. He kind of took me under his wing. Some of the things that Wilt did sometimes bothered me. I got on an elevator with Wilt, and as the elevator's going down, some guy gets on and says, oh wow ! How's the weather up there ? He said that to Wilt. Wilt spat on the dude and said it's raining. And I was like, oh my God, what is this about ? Wilt had some beautiful suits. I tried them on. They didn't fit, but they were beautiful and they were from Wilt. So I wanted to keep them, but he had partied in them and sweated through them and they didn't smell too good. So my mom said, we can't keep these, and we had to throw them out. Everywhere he went, he was interested in meeting new young ladies that were beautiful. He had one girlfriend from Denmark that I was like in love with. But I'm 15 years old, and I had zero chance. I didn't try to put any moves on her, but I was like, wishful thinking. Everybody said that as a center, I wasn't going to make it because I was not a big bruising type like Wilt. I wanted to see if I could do it, if I could challenge the success of Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. I wanted to go beyond all of them. 1964 threatens to be a very explosive year. Alcindor's basketball ambitions were growing at a tumultuous breaking point in history. And even as a teenager, he grasped it. He joined Power's debate team, and spent the summer of 1964 with a Harlem program to develop promising young black leaders. Mid summer brought to the negro areas a new phase of racial relations. In Harlem, the funeral of a teenager who had been shot by a policeman set off demonstrations against the police brutality. I was taking the train home, and I decided to stop off in Harlem to see what was happening. And just got out on 125th Street and it was like crazy. I stepped into this big whirlpool of violence. Bottles were being thrown. You could hear gunshots, glass breaking. When you see people being murdered and beaten, it makes you angry. Makes you want to affect change. When you think of the impact of the Harlem Riots on a 17-year-old, highly sensitive, highly reflective young black brother, I would think the first thing that hit him was, what are the roots of this rage, and how does it connect to me ? Lew is a seven foot one inch phenomenon. He leaded his team to its third consecutive New York high school title. Alcindor is almost unstoppable, as you can see. In four years at Power Memorial, Lew Alcindor's teams won 95 games and lost just six. He'd justified the massive expectations that had been growing since he was in junior high school. And that turned him into perhaps the most celebrated college recruit in basketball history. Any basketball coach that had not heard of Lewis Alcindor isn't doing much of a job coaching. Being the most sought-after high school player in the country was intense. It got to the point that year where Coach Donohue said that any school that has a basketball program, you can go there on a scholarship. But the south was out. I did not want to go to school in the south. I did not want to be the first black athlete to go to any program in the south. That would have been a whole lot more pressure. He was impacted by the civil right movement, he was impacted by race. He began to cultivate a real opinion about things at a lot younger age than I did. I was just playing basketball. I went out to UCLA. Palm trees and the grass was growing. It was like, wow ! I got a letter from Jackie Robinson. UCLA is the place to go, get a great education, the basketball program's first rate. Coach Wooden was very clear that he wanted me to stay at UCLA for four years and get my degree, and that's what I wanted to do. The best player in the country was heading to Los Angeles to join the two-time defending national champions. The announcement came at a press conference in the Power Memorial gym on May 4th, 1965. What was the big factor in choosing UCLA over St. John's ? Well, it wasn't that UCLA was better, it just had what I wanted. - Which is what ? - It has the big college atmosphere. It's just a nice place and I like the people. You're 18, and your dad's a cop, your mom is like on you all the time, coming out here was just a welcomed break. It was the first time I'd gone to school with females. Kareem was a ladies' man, yeah. He had skills. When you played basketball, everybody wanted to get to know who you are. Our social life on the weekend was us hopping in a car and Kareem with his knees up above his ears, and we would drive down Sunset Strip and whistle at the girls. The party would come to us. We'd smoke pot. It was fun. I started to see what southern California was all about. Life out on the coast agreed with the kid from New York. And on the court, there was an instant attraction to his new coach's approach. I was impressed with John Wooden because for someone as successful as he was, he was a very humble man. And very reserved. And having lived with my father my whole life, I was kind of used to authority figures having that kind of demeanor. Coach Wooden enabled us to understand that the most important aspect of the game was winning. It wasn't about what any one individual did. As a freshman, NCAA rules prohibited him from playing on the varsity. But in an exhibition game in the fall of 1965, he famously offered a hint of just how impressively he'd dominate the college game. His freshman team beat the UCLA varsity when the UCLA varsity was the defending national champions. We freshmen beat the varsity every day ! So when game time came around, we didn't worry about losing. They were worried about losing. Many a promising young man comes to Hollywood hoping to become a star. Very few make it. But here's one who at the age of 19 and barely a year out of high school has made it, and made it big. But then, everything about this young man is big. His name is Lew Alcindor. He's 7-feet-1 and 3/8 inches tall. Now in his first varsity season, he's the most photographed, most talked-about player in a decade. I realized how big a figure I was on campus when Sports Illustrated came out in December of '66, I'm on a fold-out cover. UCLA is expected to win the NCAA Championship. He got 56 in his debut against USC. That was the last man to man he saw in three years. He was unstoppable in college. There wasn't nothing in college like Lew Alcindor. Just to see this superhero come out and play basketball. Every game he ever played in, he was the focal point. In his first year on the varsity, UCLA went undefeated on their way to the National Championship. The sophomore center was a phenomenon. Even if he didn't always appear comfortable in the role. I doubt if ever a team in the history of intercollegiate athletics has been under such great pressure and I doubt if any individual has ever been under any more pressure than Lewis Alcindor. There was such an intense demand from the media to interview us. Of course Wooden told us not to talk to the press. So I developed some suspicion there, and kind of saw them as something that could go wrong. People quote me as saying one thing, and they feel that's all I have to say. And that's not necessarily how it is. I'm a young man out here trying to get my education. That's why I'm here. And so far everything is going well as far as that's concerned, and that's what's most important. It was just the start of a long and wary relationship with the press. But in the near-term, a very different controversy would emerge in the fall of 1967 when the NCAA announced it was banning the dunk. The organization cited injury concerns as the reason. But the overwhelming sense was otherwise. Given the glorification of the dunk in our age, it is hard for anyone under the age of 40 to imagine a period of time in which it was an evil act. The number one reason we all assumed was the dominance of one person. They're clearly trying to neutralize Lew Alcindor and UCLA. There wasn't a whole lot of white guys doing a whole lot of dunks. So I thought there might have been a racial element to it, I didn't know for sure, I still don't. Whatever the reasons behind the ban, it only forced Alcindor to hone the rest of his game. And by the halfway point of his junior season, the Bruins had stretched their winning streak to 47 games, which turned a January 20th matchup with the also undefeated Houston Cougars into a showdown of unprecedented proportions In the sport. They would call it the game of the century. You wanted to have that moment with Lew Alcindor. You wanted to be able to go against him. His star was shining bright in the heavens, and my goal is to take his star out, and put mine up there. But in the week before the game, a scratched cornea kept Alcindor off the court. The Houston game is very possible. It's just a question of time. If my eye heals in time, I'll be able to play. We're glad you're with us from the Astrodome, over 52,000 fans, the largest paid audience to ever see basketball anywhere at any level. Hayes, number 44, was battling head to head with UCLA's Lew Alcindor. Alcindor suffering from an injury to his left eye missed many shots he usually makes. He had had a patch over his eye. We were thinking that that was only a ploy. It's amazing that Lew Alcindor can even play tonight, after he spent four days in the hospital. Blocked by Hayes ! Elvin Hayes had just an awesome game. We could not guard him. And here is Hayes ! The game lived up to every expectation and a pair of free throws in the final minute from Hayes would determine the outcome. The Houston Cougars have snapped UCLA's 47 game winning streak ! When that horn sounded, wow, we had beaten the unbeatable. After losing the game and seeing the Sports Illustrated cover, it says "Big Eeee over Big Lew", I taped it in the back of my locker. And so every day I got to see that, I was determined that the next time, if we got to play the University of Houston again, I wouldn't have a bad game. The loss was stunning. But UCLA rebounded to close out the regular season with 12 straight wins. And in the NCAA Tournament, reached the final four easily, which gave Alcindor another shot at Hayes and now top-ranked Houston. The basketball giants prepare for their long-awaited rematch. The Bruins now to reverse their only loss in two years and prove that the honors received by Houston were premature. The Cougars realize that this is a different Lew Alcindor than the one they controlled in the Astrodome. They had no chance to win that game, it was over before the first half was over. The Bruins of UCLA put on perhaps one of the greatest performance ever seen in college basketball. One night later, UCLA routed North Carolina to capture their second straight national title. The 78 to 55 UCLA win is the most one-sided victory in NCAA title game history. But that's what happens when you play Alcindor and company. I'd like to thank everybody for all the support they gave us. It was lots of fun playing for you. Of course, you were having fun on Saturday night and we had to work. CLEVELAND UNIVERSAL NEWSREEL Nine top negro athletes meet with Cassius Clay to discuss his anti-draft stance. They include Bill Russell, Lew Alcindor and former pro footballer Jimmy Brown. In the spring of 1967, the so-called Ali Summit in Cleveland marked the public arrival of the 20-year old Alcindor as a black athlete set on making an impact beyond the sports arena. If you're in a racist society it's up to you to do something for yourself. And I've seen the promised land... When Martin Luther King was assassinated a year afterwards, Alcindor joined protests on the UCLA campus. We stood along Bruin walk, you know, there's about 40 or 50 activists. It was interesting, the reaction that a lot of people had to me participating. Because it was like, hey you're going to go play in the NBA and make a lot of money, what are you demonstrating about ? It was offensive that they would think that because I had the opportunity to play, possibly, in the NBA, that I shouldn't be concerned about the way black Americans are treated, and the denial of our basic human rights. Through all the turbulence of the times, Alcindor found in his coach a mentor he could confide in. But as "John Wooden confided" in a letter he wrote, the burden his young star was bearing was concerning. I have seen him hurt so much by the remarks of white people. I have heard remarks within his hearing such as "look at that big black freak." I am truly afraid that he will never find any peace of mind. 1969 marks the end of an era. In the three years that Wooden coached Alcindor, they won three consecutive national championships. No big man has ever dominated the sport in the Alcindor manner. Alcindor went an astounding 88-2 in his UCLA varsity career. And then, with a degree in history in hand, readied for the next chapter. Every year in basketball, or in football, or in hockey, good players come along. But a player the caliber of Lew Alcindor, he does not come along every year. He was certain to be the first overall selection in the 1969 NBA draft. And his destination would be determined by a coin flip. The Suns and the Milwaukee Bucks, last place finishers in the east, were the participants in the famous flip and here's the way it went. Phoenix, I call heads. The coin has come up tails. The Milwaukee Bucks won the most important draft pick in NBA's history. The prize is the sensational Lew Alcindor from UCLA. Whoever got him would have the makings of a championship team. The second pick ended up being Neil Walk, who was a nice player, but you know you're talking about Lew Alcindor at the time... c'mon. If you want to go to a place and have your goosebumps retread, Milwaukee in the wintertime would be a good place. For me to go to Milwaukee was really a step away from everything that I knew. I was thinking to myself, what is this going to do for this community, this city, this state, to have a player like Lew Alcindor come in here to a team that was really just a young, fledgling team. Hello and welcome to the Lew Alcindor NBA debut. This Is his first professional game and what the whole country has waited for. There he is, working one on one against Bellamy. His first shot. Alcindor and his first attempt from the field. The numbers do speak for themselves. We have gone from 27 to 56 wins. And now we had a lot of national following in terms of writers, TV and video crews. People were excited to see Lew Alcindor. Still, even with their new superstar, the team, in just its second year of existence, had undeniable holes in the backcourt. The point guard position really was a position that we needed to improve. After my rookie year, the people in the Bucks organization said we're going to try and get Oscar. And I said, well jeez, he's kind of old, isn't he ? In fact, at age 31, Oscar Robertson was arguably the best guard in the NBA, a former league MVP, and ten-time all-star. But when he was acquired by the Bucks, both sides had questions about how he'd fit in. Milwaukee was a beer town, hard workers. Not a lot of black people. When I got to Milwaukee, all I'd heard for many, many years was, yeah, you've done this, but you haven't won a championship. Oscar was one of the best guards in the game. But I didn't know if Oscar would be able rise to the occasion. You have to play with guys first and find out what they can do under pressure. It "would" take some time for the superstars to mesh. But soon enough, the Bucks were overwhelming the competition. Oscar Robertson and Lew Alcindor, how does it ever get any better than that ? We were the fastest team in the league. We could score points in bundles. We were just rockin' and killin' people. The team posted a 66-16 regular season record. And then continued their domination in the playoffs. sweeping the Baltimore Bullets in the finals to win the NBA title, with Alcindor earning MVP honors. It's over ! The Milwaukee Bucks are the champions of the world ! For me to win the world championship was what I'd always hoped for. Look who is here. Congratulations. Oscar just paid you a great compliment. You had a great series. With his big help. Without Kareem, I couldn't have gotten the championship. The fact that I got to play with Oscar, one of the great players in the game, who'd never won a world championship, and by partnering up with him, we were both able to be successful. Soon after the title came a revelation from the Bucks' center. He had converted from Catholicism to Islam. And as part of the transformation, he'd changed his name. He was no longer Lew Alcindor, but instead, Kareem Abdul Jabbar. So it's Abdu al-Jabbar and Abdu al-Kareem, meaning servant of the noble, servant of the irresistible. The Milwaukee Bucks signed Lew Alcindor, not Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. When you go from a Christian name to a Muslim name, basically, you're going to catch hell. We had to get used to it. We started calling him Kareem. He was a Muslim in Milwaukee. It didn't fit very well. There were a lot of questions from the press about Islam. This came out of nowhere, as far as they were concerned. But for Kareem, the change had been materializing for years. I started learning about Islam my freshman year at UCLA. I read the autobiography of Malcolm X and then I started to read other things. A couple of the other Muslim students gave me a Quran. I had taken on an Islamic identity, tried living the lifestyle, and it seemed to make sense to me, and by 1971 I wanted to do it formally. I think he felt that he had a platform at this particular point because the team had just won the championship and it might have a bigger impact and make it more welcomed, in response. It was more welcomed certainly than when Ali had declared he had become a black Muslim. Kareem talked about it a little more in terms of the reasons why and had not the kind of anger that was encapsulated in Ali's coming out, that this was a religion he believed in. I think that the religion is a beautiful religion, if that's what you want. He's still our son, he regards himself as such, and we have that relationship. Religion aside. I never ever wanted to insult my family, but I wanted to have an Islamic identity. I did not feel the name that I was born with would have been my name. It was the result of the experience of slavery. In fact, it was my dad that introduced me to a friend of his named Hamaas. He helped me to understand the difference between Orthodox Islam and what the Black Muslims were talking about. Hamaas Abdul Khaalis had been a leader in Elijah Muhammad's Militant Nation of Islam, or Black Muslims, before bitterly splitting from the group in the late 1950's and creating his own smaller, rival sect, the Hanafi movement. In Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hamaas had by far his most high-profile disciple. A follower who had the means to purchase a house in Washington, D.C. that would become the organization's headquarters. It was from there that Hamaas guided the lives of all his adherents. Including the wedding of Kareem and a young woman he'd met in Los Angeles, Janice Brown, who'd also taken on a new name, Habiba, after converting. If I were to live a moral life, I should be married and not be promiscuous. She was very attractive, very down to earth person. She thought that I had some appeal and we hit it off that way. Kareem wielded the power in his household. The ladies would have to ask permission before entering the room. Anything we would eat, would have to be tasted by the ladies first. He was following the rules of a great Muslim leader of the family. And that was what he wanted to be; he wanted to be that shining light. The marriage would produce three children, but it also would serve as the source of a massive rift between Kareem and his parents, who were banned from the wedding by Hamaas because they were non-Muslims. Hamaas tried to come between people and their families. That was the worst part of what he did, just the way he isolated everybody. Hamaas made us feel like it was us against the world. And it didn't have to be that way. Here in Washington, six persons reported killed in a wave of violence at a home owned by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the pro basketball star once named Lew Alcindor. In 1973, I was a reporter in Chicago. And the Hannafi thing broke in Washington. A house that Kareem had purchased for the Hannafi Muslims. Police ambulances taking away the bodies, seven in all. It's been the most heinous crime I've ever witnessed in my nineteen years of service. When the massacre happened, I was in Milwaukee. Basically, it had to do with the fact that Hamaas had provoked the Black Muslims. He said that Elijah Muhammad was a fraud and that the Black Muslim movement was not Islamic. And it obviously outraged these people, and they sent people to kill him. And when they attacked his house, he wasn't there, they tried to kill all the people that were there. It was a very horrible and ugly incident. The massacre, which counted five children among the victims, led to concerns about Kareem's own security. It was very, very distracting, for the team as well as for Jabbar. We had FBI people following and protecting the team. The Milwaukee Bucks had their own security. We feared for our lives and he feared for his life more than any of us. He was always used to a spotlight, but this was a friggin' laser. When you have an athletic career, and then you have all this turmoil on some religious tangent, it doesn't make for a very harmonious life. While his connection to Hamaas grew embroiled in more and more controversy, a measure of balance could be found in his long-time interest in martial arts. Particularly in the form of a friendship he'd made in Los Angeles with a rising film star named Bruce Lee. Bruce and I really were kindred spirits. I enjoyed competition. Bruce enjoyed competition. Bruce wanted to be the best at what he did. I wanted to be the best at what I did. It was a challenge for him to box me because my arms were so long. He always said it was like fighting an octopus. I made him duck and I made him do things that he didn't have to do when he worked out against other people. He always liked to challenge himself. I had trained with Bruce for four years, and he said, let's do a movie. Shooting a movie in Hong Kong was a great experience. In the martial arts movies the bad guys are supposed to be in character and be really bad, so I was just trying to absorb that presence because I knew it would work for the film that we were doing. In 1973, a year after filming his scenes for "Game of Death", Kareem spent his summer studying overseas. I was in Saudi Arabia and Libya, studying Arabic. And I decided to go home through Hong Kong, so maybe I'd get a chance to visit him. And on the day that I was getting ready to leave for Hong Kong, there were headlines in the papers that Bruce had died. I just went on home. It was a sad day. He was a wonderful human being. I had the fortune to be his friend, and the next thing you knew, he was gone. I really miss him. As personal losses and complications mounted in the early 1970's, even as he won two more MVP awards, his team failed to win another title, culminating in a heartbreaking seven-game loss in the finals to the Boston Celtics in 1974. The next season, with Robertson retired, the Bucks plunged to last place. It was the first time Abdul-Jabbar had ever played on a losing team. With his contract set to expire the following year, he used his leverage to demand a trade. Are we ready ? We've invited you here to share with us the most explosive sports announcement of our time. So join us, won't you, in welcoming the newest Laker... Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ! We are very happy to announce today that we have signed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to a new 5 year contract. Do you feel any particular great pressure as the man that's supposed to bring the championship ? No, not really, everybody involved knows it'll take more than one man. I'm going to be very instrumental in helping to achieve that goal, but it's going to take more than one man. - Do you feel you can do it ? - I know I can do my part of it. You had the hope diamond when you got him. Everybody thought they were going to win a championship. When I came back to Los Angeles I didn't have very many expectations, I was just happy to make it some place where I felt at home. Back in the city where he'd scaled his greatest heights, Kareem won his fourth and fifth MVP awards in his first two seasons with the Lakers. But while he instantly made Los Angeles contenders again, he failed to deliver a championship, as the team continually fell short in the playoffs to other deeper Western conference powers. In this league, it's about players. It's about players that fit together. They weren't good enough. I did take a lot of heat in the press and there was nothing I could do. I was making the All-Star team, leading the league in all kinds of categories and we didn't win and a number of the writers felt that it was me not getting it done, when basically we did not have the right personnel to get it done. Even though he was dominant, he was empty. I mean, you can be dominant and win scoring titles and be an MVP. But if you're not a champion, what the hell's it worth ? There were also continued difficulties in his personal life, including alienation from Hamaas and the Hanafis, and the collapse of his marriage to Habiba. I know one thing I've heard them, maybe the only thing they agree on. At the time they were young, they were somewhat impressionable. But you live and you hope you learn. Because I was doing it for ideological reasons, it didn't take the way it should have. My marriage broke up because of that. But it wasn't my wife's fault. It was my fault. I just didn't know what I was doing. At times, Kareem's frustration could boil over on the court. Never more dramatically than two minutes into opening night of the 1977-78 season, when he squared up with Bucks center Kent Benson. I don't want to say he deserved it, but he did. Everybody who's played knows that you're going to run into an elbow, you're going to get clipped by somebody's shoulder, or run into somebody's hip. Those things happen. It's intentional things you really tend to resent. He took a swing at me, and hit me with an elbow in my solar plexus, knocked all the wind out of me. It was a dirty play on Benson's part. All I wanted to do was retaliate... and I did. I didn't see it, I heard it. This loud crack. Kent paid the price for everyone else that roughed me up and gotten away with it. I was ready to fight everybody at that point. A broken hand from the punch would leave him sidelined for two months. The incident, meanwhile, perpetuated a frosty, at times even irritable aura, that had surrounded him dating back to his days at UCLA. I don't smile because they don't say anything funny. I mean, I just react to people the way they come off. If you come off like you don't know anything, that's how I'm going to react to you. He did not have a lot of patience with the public, with the fans. I think in the late 70's he became more distant. Kind of aloof, shy, he didn't feel comfortable in the environment that other players did. Unfriendly might have been correct at the time. But Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is one of the most misunderstood people ever in sports. People saw me as just a very serious person who didn't have any fun or enjoy anything. I'd already been typecast as the brooding black guy. I think it had a lot to do with the era that we were raised in. I had to toe a certain line and not be too controversial or too much my own man. I just seemed to be like Mr. Grump, so being able to poke fun at my image was fun and changed people's minds. Wait a minute, I know you ! You're Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers. You must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdoch. I'm the co-pilot. Our original idea for the role of the co-pilot in Airplane was Pete Rose. But I think we started shooting it in the summer, so he was active in baseball at the time, and gambling of course. And so kind of late in the game, we rewrote the part for Kareem because we were also huge fans. I think you're the greatest but my dad says you don't work hard enough on defense. And he says that lots of times you don't even run downcourt. And that you don't really try, except during the play-offs. Listen kid, I've been hearing that crap ever since I was at UCLA. I'm out there busting my buns every night. It was easy to write dialogue for Kareem because, back in those days, on a slow news day, if you wanted to take shots at Kareem, you would go to his defense and whether he works as hard during the regular season as he does during the playoffs. It was great for the film world, and I'm sure fun for Kareem. But I think for us, it said, Kareem's doing comedy. He's not mad ! We talk about how comedy heals, and how it cures so many ills, it was a public relations cure for Kareem's ill. Because after that movie, the world kind of exhaled and said, ah, it's all right to like him. While Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's personality may have long been hard to figure, through all the highs and lows of the 1970's his dominance as a player took on an almost mystical component. Thanks to the shot he'd been perfecting ever since he'd first walked onto a basketball court. The sky hook. This is my body, and this is where I want to go. This is what I'm going to do, and there's nothing you can do about it. We were all helpless. He's like a watch, one of the best watches in the world. The precision that he had. By using movement to a place where I can get the shot off at eight feet, I knew I could make those shots on a regular basis. He jumped so high and he's got his body in between the defensive player and the ball. There's no way for a defender to even get near him. It's the prettiest shot that I've ever seen in my life. I'll tell you one thing, you just couldn't guard it. The leap with grace and with style and then the aiming and throwing the ball down. And once he got up here, and had his eyeballs on the rim, forget it. The cruise missile, the most unstoppable weapon in the history of the NBA. And that ball just taking its time... That's nice, that's nice. There's a new sports magnate in Hollywood. Dr. Jerry Buss, a real estate mogul and former rocket scientist, is now the owner of pro basketball's Los Angeles Lakers and the Forum, the team's home arena in Inglewood, California. When Jerry Buss bought the Lakers in 1979, his unabashed focus was on increasing the star power at the Forum in every respect. He brought in live band, he brought in the Laker girls, he made it the place to be. - The Lakers are number one. - Fantastic. With Abdul-Jabbar, Buss had arguably the league's most talented player. And with his first draft pick, he instantly acquired its brightest new personality to boot, The Los Angeles Lakers select Earvin Magic Johnson from Michigan State. I was such a Kareem freak, I loved Kareem before I actually came to the Lakers. So when I got to the Lakers they said, oh, you're gonna be Kareem's rookie, I said, great ! I'm excited, what do I need to do ? So I went over to Kareem, what do you need ? I'm like this 2 year old you know, goin' up to him. He said, I'd like 2 Gatorades after every time-out, or break in practice, and I want you to get my newspaper, have it at my door every morning. I said, what else ? I was so excited to just be a part of his life, because I wanted to get up under him and learn a lot. The rookie's elation about playing alongside Kareem, and being a Laker, was on full display in his very first NBA game. Magic Johnson and Kareem. Ford sends it to Kareem. Sky hook... Lakers win. Magic Johnson is celebrating like they've won the NCAA championship. What the hell's he doing ? We played one game. We only have 81 more to play. Kareem immediately recognized the value that was there, but it was like, can you please turn it down ? Can you turn it off sometimes ? He didn't stop his enthusiasm, but he had so much respect for Kareem. He didn't come in and just take over the leadership role. So we figured out how we could help each other. He knew how to get me the ball, I knew how to help him on defense. Kareem sort of said, you lead the team, and you throw me the ball. All of a sudden, people had to focus on him to make sure that he wasn't a guy who was going to beat them, and that gave me opportunities. He was unstoppable. The bigger the moment, the more dominant he becomes. The world's best are prepared to go head to head for the National Basketball Association Championship title. Together that season, Magic and Kareem led the Lakers to the finals for the first time since 1973 where they'd face off against Julius Erving and the Philadelphia 76ers. The teams split the series' first four games, and then in a tight game 5, Abdul-Jabbar was dominating the offensive end. Kareem turns underneath and puts it up. But Kareem is hurt. He turned an ankle. If you're there, you're saying, this isn't going to continue without Kareem. I don't think Kareem is going to be able to go anymore. It was so unusual for him to be hurt. No matter how bad he was, he was always there. They brought him back out for the fourth quarter. He plays the last quarter on one foot. He goes head to head with Dr. J., and he really wins Game 5. After the game, I was just like, wow, what am I going to do now because I need like two weeks for this to heal. We've got to play Philadelphia in a couple of days. I wish I could do something but you feel very helpless. I don't think any of us knew how bad it was until we get to the airport and they say he can't play. So we have to figure out how we are going to replace not just his points, but his defensive skills. We didn't know how we were going to do that. And Kareem was really a guy who you can't replace. You are looking live at the sold out crowd at the Spectrum in Philadephia. Kareem remained back in Los Angeles when the team travelled to Philly. His Laker co-star, meanwhile, would take his place for the opening tip. A young man by the name of Magic Johnson is going to start at center. Magic's performance would be one for the NBA annals. Another assist for Magic. The Lakers won the game and the title. There it is, it's over, and the MVP is Magic Johnson. 42 points, 15 rebounds and 7 assists. He starts at center, plays forward and guard and leads the L.A. Lakers to world championship. 123-107 over Philadelphia without Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. I just tried to do my best and it has been beautiful. You are the MVP. You have some words to say to the big fella back in LA ? Yeah, Big Fella, we love you, we did it for you, and we want you to get up and dance a little bit tonight. I know that ankle hurts, but get up for us. So we fly home, they're all celebrating and we arrive back in LA. All of a sudden, Kareem bolts into the plane. He's just beaming. When they opened the door, instead of us going out, he came in. Didn't even wait for your boy ? They've got everything waiting for you. All the ladies... For us ! I'm the valet now. Kareem just dominated that series. He was averaging over 30 points in that series. He was actually the MVP. Magic offered to give me the trophy, and I was like, no, we're not going to let that become an issue between us. He helped me because I wanted to be a champion and a winner, and I helped him because he loosened up. I just want to thank you and tell you that you are beautiful. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has been almost as difficult to profile as to guard. He has spoken candidly on television only rarely, and he has shielded his private life jealously. But now Kareem is changing, and the story of his change is only incidentally a sports story. It is more of a love story. He'd first introduced himself to Cheryl Pistono on an escalator in Los Angeles. But she didn't reciprocate his interest until he took her to watch him play in a celebrity game at Dodger Stadium, and then climbed the upper deck to get her. I'm thinking to myself, he's not really doing this, because everyone stopped watching the game down there, and started to watch him, as he walked up to me, and took my hand and walked me out of the stadium. And at that moment I fell. I fell off the Grand Canyon. I never ever saw him as a basketball player. I fell in love with a man. Charming, enigmatic, gentle, kind. We would have these discussions about politics and religion and the economy and he was an amazing human being. Cheryl was a pretty outgoing person, and that was a wonderful thing for me. She was a Buddhist, I was a Muslim. We cared about each other and we appreciated each other. She also was instrumental in repairing a rupture in his life that had persisted for years. I'd been separated from my parents and a lot of my friends because Hamaas felt that anybody outside the community was suspicious. And Cheryl said that your parents are your parents, they love you whether you're Muslim or not. You need to have them back in your life. So I surprise him and flew them to LA. Eventually they moved to Los Angeles. He's very much a family person. And he was happy to have his parents in his life. In 1981, Cheryl gave birth to Kareem's fourth child, Amir. After Amir was born, held him up in his arms, and he named him at that moment. You saw a love that I've never seen. I gave birth to him, so I know he's mine, okay ? Beyond that, he's a mirror image of his father. One of the things I got from my father was a lot of Japanese Samurai movies. We used to watch those countless times. Music is another thing. I really enjoy jazz music and had it not been for my dad's influence, I definitely wouldn't have been introduce to it and have an appreciation for it. My brother's experience was different than mine, in terms of our father's presence. I spent more time with him when I was younger. He's my father, but he felt more like my uncle, just because, you know, seeing him sporadically. I remember he did an interview where he described himself as Uncle Dad. But at the same time, I always knew we had food on the table, we never had to worry about paying the bills or getting books for school. And I knew it was because he made a good living being an athlete. I didn't have nearly enough with them that I should have. That's something that you regret. But after I realized that pursuing Islam in the way that Hamaas had thought was ideal, that wasn't the right way to live, I did a much better job, and things went better for me. And as the 80's continued, things continued to get better and better for the Lakers as well. Eleven games into the 81-82 season, Pat Riley became LA's interim head coach, and immediately increased the team's offensive tempo. And with that, the showtime era took off. It was fresh and it was very intense defensively and offensively. All the different elements of that team, the joy of Magic, and Kareem, who was used so beautifully, and Byron and Worthy and Cooper and the coach in the Armani suits, it was phenomenal. The centerpiece was the scene. If you weren't in the Forum Club, you were a fucking nobody, okay ? The players would go, all the girls were there. We'd be all be going this way and down that long dark tunnel would be Kareem. He didn't want any part of it. Guys would be jumping around all over the place, and he'd be reading a book. He would never look up. Never. Kareem was just a different piece of toast, man. By January of 1983, he was 35 years old, but still an all-star averaging more than 20 points a game for a team defending another championship. Then came a harsh reminder of just how much else he had to lose. Fire today caused an estimated three million dollars damage to the Bel Air home of Los Angeles Lakers star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. I was in Boston. We had played the Celtics and I got a call like at five or six in the morning. From Cheryl, who I was living with at the time. She said that the house had burned down. I said, c'mon. She said nobody was hurt, but the house is burned down. And I couldn't believe that. I'll never forget as long as I live, he picked me up on the way in town to take me to see his house, and he was so calm, like he usually is. And we look at this devastated place. Just down to the ground, man. The rugs were burnt up. All of his trophies were melted. Everything. The losses also included his extensive jazz collection which he'd been accumulating for decades, all the way back to when his father had first introduced him to music. My first thought was, was Kareem there ? Is he okay ? And that jazz collection. If it had survived. And if it didn't, how devastating that would be. For him to endure this tremendous fire and have his house burn down, and so much of his jazz collection destroyed, I'm sure that tore at his heartstrings. He and his dad would just go in there and get lost in music. And when that burned, it's like someone put an arrow in his heart. It didn't take him long to realize that his son was alive. And that so far outweighed any thing that was lost in the fire. Kareem and Cheryl Pistono parted ways later in 1983, though they'd remain close as the years went on. Meanwhile a year after the fire came one of the biggest milestones of his career. Not to mention a chance to pass an old friend in the record book. Tonight fans, a possible history-making basketball moment. Kareem needs just 21 points to pass Wilt Chamberlain and become basketball's all-time leading scorer. I really felt a strong connection to Wilt, in that I had known him since I was in grade school. And here I was getting ready to break his record. I had a dream about it. We were running in the woods, and I'm trying to pass him, it's like a long, cross-country race. I remember talking to Ervin, and he said, I don't know what the situation's going to be, but there's no way that anyone else is going to pass him the ball but me when he breaks the record. Kareem, he did like a little ballet. He went back baseline and threw about a 15-foot hook shot. They love their captain. They love their leader. Ladies and gentlemen, the new king of scoring has ascended his throne. Two decades had passed since Wilt had taken the kid from New York under his wing. Over that time, Kareem had hardly followed in his one-time mentor's footsteps. Off or on the court. They were completely opposite. Chamberlain was more about force and strength. Kareem was more about finesse and "ballet-like." They were just completely opposite, but yet they were alike. They were 2 apples. And depending on which apple you like, you eat the best. That's who they were. Each of them had a different effect on how the game was played. Why aren't you guys closer ? Athletes are really tough people... they have a lot of pride. They're very competitive. And him and I are natural rivals. There was not a whole lot of love lost, and I think it was more from Kareem's side, as the competitor. He's the guy that I've got to take out, to surpass, to beat. Wilt Chamberlain was jealous of Kareem and never missed an opportunity to attack him in print. At one time, he said I named my dog Kareem but I spelled it with a C because he has a heart. I think that really hurt Kareem. Wilt had a big ego. And he started taking shots at me. And when that happened, I didn't like it. And I let him know about it, and I let anybody who asked me know about it, and that's when things more or less went south. Now the crowd is chanting beat L.A. Surpassing Wilt Chamberlain at least in one way brought his career full circle. But as Kareem remained an impact player deep into his 30's, he became part of another kind of rivalry that took over basketball's center stage. We don't often have a series which people anticipate that become reality. This is one that has. People have been talking about it for a long time. And today is going to happen. The 1984 Finals were a fierce a rivalry as I've ever seen. The Lakers are leading Game 4 against the Celtics, up two games to one. Next thing you know, Rambis is cruising in when he just got taken down by a really hard, hard foul. Instead of us just keeping our cool, we turn into a bunch of street fighters. Bird fights. Kareem swings the elbow and now he's yelling at Larry Bird. Jaw to jaw. He tried to take my head off. If he would have connected, I'd still be asleep. You know, it was so close. I could feel the wind off his elbow. And I wasn't too happy. And they better pull them apart. That whole thing was retaliation, trying to get back. And I should have tried to quell that more than I did. And so we ended up losing in '84. Final seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. The Boston Celtics are the NBA world champions. PRIDE I was feeling so bad, so down, I was crying, staying in my house all the time. Because I made some crucial mistakes to lose that series. He said, don't worry about it, we're going to play them again. And we were just hanging out, talking as guys, and that was the breakthrough. All of us looked at each other that summer, and looked at that loss as the turning point in the dynasty that came five years after that. The next season, the Lakers made it back to the finals for the rematch they wanted with the Celtics. But in the series opener, LA's center suddenly and unexpectedly looked his age. So now it's 1985, and the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers, it's Game 1 of the NBA Finals, and there we all are again, and Kareem had a horrible night. Parrish is beating Jabbar up the court every single time. Every newspaper was calling him an old man. You know, it's over, he's too old. I mean, he was brutally criticized by the press. And I felt for the guy. It was like I got to the game late and I was trying to catch everybody as they ran away from me on the court. I just, I wasn't there. The next day, we come in for a film session. He was the first guy sitting there, in the center seat, first row, right in front of the video. And he looked up at me, and he said, give it to me, and don't stop. I was hammering him, you've got more guts than that, Cap. We spend the next two hours rebounding and transition drills. and Magic finally comes up and says, Coach, save him, he'll be dead by Thursday night. Kareem overheard the conversation, and said, no, don't take me out, I'm doing it all, what everybody else does, I'm doing it. We all were just feeling bad, how bad Boston beat us. So we come down for the bus for Game 2. Pat Riley had a rule, can't nobody ride on the bus. And so I look out on the window, and he's running towards the bus, and his father is coming with him. And then Mr. Alcindor gets on. Okay, maybe they came in to just say hi to him. And then the next moment, the door closes, and the bus takes off. So here's the oldest guy on the team, why you riding with your dad ? I still to this day don't know what that meant, but it gave us something. You know having my dad there was someone familiar that I trusted, someone that wanted to see me succeed. Maybe the most important game that the Lakers and him ever played, that he needed the solace of his father's wisdom When he was backed into a corner, who he reached out to ? It wasn't one of us. It was his parents. And that says a lot to me about Kareem, and who he is as a man. "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar out to prove Game 1 sleepwalk a fluke." Kareem was very criticized after the most embarrassing loss in team history. He conjured up something from 1973. And he moved like a graceful gazelle, like a young kid. He is playing like a rookie, watch him come over on this shot. I can remember him taking Robert Parrish and Kevin McHale to school as if they were midgets. His position on the offensive play was harder, he was contesting shots, he was moving to help, he was just all over the court. There was nothing we could do. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has come back with a vengeance. 30 points and 16 rebounds, he indeed has been the spearhead for this Laker comeback. I just ratcheted everything up and said, I've got to get back to what I know I can do. If you watched him tonight, he played with tremendous passion and lead us, got every big rebound. Without him tonight, we're an average team. They had buried him, and he came up and stuck his hand up out of the grave, and said no. It feels good to know that you're not dead, they had people throwing dirt on my face. It's good to know that that was a little premature. LA took two of the next three at home, and then looked to close it out on enemy grounds. And welcome to the Boston Garden, which through the years, has been the home court advantage. It's Game 6, and the Lakers are one victory away from a world championship. and ending one of the longest jinxes in the history of professional sports. The tip controlled by Boston. Kareem tips it in. Kareem ! It's the Lakers showing their offensive class. Four on the shot clock, Kareem goes up and scores. We saw that he was animated, and ready to play... and it was great. Kareem hits again with a skyhook. What that was, that's who he was inside... he was a champion. Three in six years, LA comes to Boston and wins the world title ! Kareem never gloats, it's just not his personality, but for that one time, he's got this smile on his face, like, I gotcha and I'm still here, don't count me out. It's a great feeling to beat the Celtics and to beat them in Boston. We're the only team to ever win a world championship in Boston other than the Boston Celtics. The Lakers would win two more titles, back to back, in 1987 and '88. The championships made it six in all for Kareem, alongside six MVP awards, more than any other player in history, as well as a record 19 All-Star Game appearances. Now past 40, he was still playing a significant role for the league's best team. But at the dawn of the 1989 campaign, he announced he'd finally be retiring at season's end. And what ensued over the next several months was evidence of just how far a road he'd traveled. When Kareem retired, he had his farewell tour. And it was the last chance for everyone to give this guy his due. People that would boo him and call him the N-word his whole life. The tour went to every arena in the league. And at every stop, the response was the same. Even the Boston Garden. He didn't have any clue how well they were going to receive him. What he's done for the game is unparalleled. We don't want him to forget anything about this building. We've got to give him a piece of this floor. KAREEM, TWENTY BIG SEASONS I was proud of our fans. They respected the man, and they gave him a hell of an ovation. When you begin to characterize what truly the greatest player of all time was, would be, a dominant player and his longevity. Kareem played for 20 years. You've got to put him right there at the top with all of these guys. He's on my Mt. Rushmore, I always tell people. When you think about what he's meant to LA sports and what he's meant to the NBA, and what he's meant to young players like myself, it's off the charts. So I'm just happy I got a chance to play alongside of him. I'm just happy we can call each other friends. The retirement tour's official final goodbye came on the final Sunday of the season. With family and former teammates crowding the arena to bid farewell to a star who looked perhaps more at ease than ever before in the Forum's spotlight. He wanted his be steady in that whole thing. He wanted to be the guy that had the character that John Wooden talked to him about. And I thought to myself, oh my god, just as he started to say hello, he said goodbye. First of all, I gotta give thanks to these folks, my mom and my dad. When your dad is a cop, and your mom believes in what's right, they set exacting standards for you, and I tried to live up to them. And they did with a lot of love. Thank you mom, thank you dad. Thank you very much. I want to thank these four little people over here, because my relationship with them wasn't what it could have been because I had to come out here on this court, and they never responded with anything other than love and appreciation, and I love you guys, and it's wonderful to have you here at this moment. Thank you. As you go along the path of life, you meet people, people that have an influence on you, people that can turn you the right way. And I've been very fortunate to know a number of people like that. I'm thinking about one of my teachers in grade school, Sister Hannah, she was beautiful. My high school coach, Jack Donohue. Then I came out to a place called Los Angeles and hooked up with a very wonderful man named John Wooden. Finally, I got to come back out here and play here in this building, and that has been a wonderful experience, because I got an opportunity to share that with you people. We've grown together, and learned to appreciate each other, and appreciate this great game that we play. I could certainly not have had a professional life if I did not get to work with people of this caliber, who care and who are my friends. I've run out of words, I'm losing my voice, and I want to say I love you all. Thank you very much. What do you see for yourself 20 years from now ? Maybe I'll be sitting on the beach with you, sipping a cool drink. Let's make a date. So many years later, maybe what he has now is indeed all Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ever wanted. A life that's become about so much more than basketball. An identity as a writer, commentator and activist that's served as a significant epilogue to his athletic career. Looking back, he almost had no choice but to embrace all the game gave him. It just took some time for the man to get there. It's pretty amazing to have taken this journey. You don't really understand it as you're going through it. Many times I turned people off with my reticence about personal engagement. It has something to do with the fact that I've been shy all my life. But it had nothing to do with lack of appreciation of the fans. And when I've gone through some of the trails of middle age, and dealing with leukemia and heart troubles and stuff, and all the fans that sent their best wishes and their prayers, it's awesome and I really appreciate it, and I'm thankful for it. THE END
