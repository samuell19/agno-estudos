Abby really wanted one last look. No, wait, wait. But if you haven't got the balls... I can't even see you. You're not at the edge, Neil, Or we'd see you. I want to see you standing. Wait, wait! Ok, ok, I... I see you. Stand up, Neil. Abby: No... Get up. No. Neil, get up. Please, don't do this. [Abby crying] Be a real man for once in your life. Unh... I'm here. I'm...

[Tom grunts] Abby: No! Don't you touch her! Get in the car. [Abby weeping] Stay in here. Stay in there. [sobbing] Listen, it doesn't matter that you were late. I was going to have her anyway. Only she doesn't know that yet. Neil: Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this to me? Why? Why... Haven't you seen it yet? Huh, Neil? What are you talking about? The answer is up there. Ah, it's right there. Look around. Where? It's under your nose. Come on, you want to know why, don't you? Aah! What does it mean? Tom: I'll tell you what it means. It means stamping out a problem. Crushing it. So, now I've got your daughter and your wife. And you're just a tiny dot in the sky. Worth nothing. Please, no, I'm begging you, don't. And what exactly am I going to do? I'll leave that to your imagination, Neil. Don't you hang up! Don't you hang up! Sweet dreams. A-Abby! Abby! [Neil sobbing] [screams] [thunder] [sirens blaring] [indistinct chatter] Hey, whoa! I need help. Yeah, the line's back there, sir. No, this is an emergency. My... my wife and child have been kidnapped. There's a psycho out there, Ok, he... he's taken my wife and my little girl. You got my car, he's driving my car. He... it's a range rover, "r"-"u", uh, 83... 83 "a." And there... he's got a woman who's helping him. She's... Pretending to be a sitter? Randall, right? Your name is Neil Randall? Yeah. I just spoke to your wife. She was here. What? W-wait, when? About half an hour ago. You spoke... You spoke to my wife? Yeah. She's ok? She explained the whole thing. Ok. She said that you might show up. With this story. At the state you're in, You'll try anything to stop her. Stop her doing what? Leaving you. No, you don't understand. No, she's not leaving me. No, he made her say that. Ok? He's got the whole thing planned. He's smart. Oh, he... He's smart, all right. He, uh... he's got our daughter. And he's made us... Forced us to do. Everything he says. Look, I get it. I know how you feel. My wife left me a year ago I went a bit... [clicks] crazy myself. I'm not some jealous husband, all right? I'm the victim of a crime! Look, you've been drinking. I'm not drunk. He did this to me. Do yourself a favor. Go home, sober up. Try and accept it, all right? Nothing for me to do. Can't help you. All right? Let's go, I'll walk you out. [panting] [distant siren blaring] [sighs] [gasps] [grunts] It's all right. Oh! Oh, baby. It's ok! It's ok. Are you ok? He didn't touch me. You promise me? Yes, I promise. He made me lie to that cop. I thought you were going to fall off the building. I thought you were going to die. Oh, baby. Oh, baby I thought I'd lost you. I thought... [chokes] I thought I'd lost everything. It's ok. Remember that feeling! 'Cause the next time I tell you to do something. You're going to do it, right? [thunder] Right, Mr. Randall? Good, now we understand each other. Get in the back. Abby: Why don't we just do it? Whatever it is. Yeah. I love you, Abby. You know that, right? [whispers] look what it takes for us to get this close. You guess where you're going yet? Just tell us. We're going where you were going all along. We're going to meet the boss. The top man. Karl granger. [whispers] I knew it had something. To do with work. Maybe. Jesus. I don't know anything, anymore. Home sweet home. [gears shift] [keys click and engine shuts off] You first, now. Just ease the way. What do I tell him? Just tell him the truth. Get out. [whispers] just do it. [door opens] [frogs croaking] [door shuts] Hey, Neil. There something I forgot to ask you. What? How far would you go? What? To save the things most important to you. How far? I would do whatever it takes. To protect my family. Yeah, I can understand that. And that's a great thing. There's this one last thing I want you to do. Go on. I want you to kill, Neil. You wanted to know what this was all about. Well, this is it. No. You are crazy. I can't do that. You don't have to. But if you don't... You'll never see Sophie again. Because believe one thing, I don't give a damn what happens to me. I can't... I can't... Neil, there's no debate here, ok? There's one person in that house. And if they're not dead. In the next 10 minutes, Someone else will be. Have you forgotten that feeling already? [scoffs] 10 minutes. [exhales] [door creaks] [creaks and shuts] [indistinct thud] [footsteps] [gasps] Oh, Jesus. You scared the life out of me. Judy? I just took a shower. I was beginning to think you weren't going to make it. Mmm. God, Neil, you look awful. What happened? You were stuck with Abby when you called, Weren't you? Is she ok? Yeah. She's ok. Well, she bought all that stuff. About going to Karl's, didn't she? Yeah, she trusts me. Yeah. Anyways, let's get this jacket off. No, no. It's cold out there. [chuckles] Ok. Well, come in by the fire, then. The usual? Yeah... yeah, thanks. [bottle clinks] So, how did you find the place? I thought you were going to call. I know what's wrong. It's a long drive, Plenty of time to discover a conscience. [sighs] Look, Neil, don't you think I felt guilty, too? But we've had all these months. Of watching our backs. Going to our little french restaurant, In the afternoons. Now, finally, we can just relax. And enjoy each other. Right? I don't know. Neil. Neil? Look, have I done something wrong? No. [scoffs] Well, then, what is it? It's nothing. Well, it's got to be something. Who is that? That's my husband Tom. I guess now you can put a face. To the name. [sighs] Where is he right now? You know where he is. He's on that hunting trip. That's why we're here. God, anyway, what's with the sudden interest. In Tom? You've never given a damn before... What do you think he would do, If he found out? He's not going to find out. Answer me! Just what would Tom do? I don't know what he'd do. It would destroy him. Christ! Why are we even talking about this? He's got Sophie. What?! Your husband has my child! Why would Tom have Sophie? What... Because he knows about us! What? He knows everything, Judy. [panting] Tom knows. [sobs] baby. He's going to kill her. What? If I don't... If you... if you don't what? What? Baby, you're scaring me. He says, he's going to kill her... What are you... if I don't... Doing with a... [gasps] no! No! Neil, don't! Get off of me! No! No! [muffled screaming and weeping] I can't. I can't. [Judy weeping] Do it! [crying] Tom! Do it, Neil.

No. [Yelling] [clicks] [weeping] [groaning] Now you see? Huh? How much he really loves you. You piece of shit! Tom! You piece of shit! It was just... Just? That's a great word, isn't it? It was just one of those office things. Just fooling around. Just an affair. Just your cock in her mouth! [crying] The mouth that kisses me good-bye in the morning. But hey! It's no big deal. It's not a matter of life and death. But then, you tell me, What the fuck ever is? Get up. Well, hmm, you're not such a bad guy, Neil. I mean, you go to work, You go to the gym, you go home, You pat your kid on the head. You screw your wife. Then you screw mine. The end of a perfect day. [both grunting] It wasn't her you were screwing, Was it? No. It was me. Me you got inside. Huh? So, come on, Neil. Kiss me, huh? Come on, kiss me! [spits] Oh, you piece of shit! No! Tom! No! Please. Stop. [whispers] oh. [stammers] I will. I will. Please. [Grunts] [panting] [object thuds] Oh, god. [Judy crying] [panting] Where's my daughter? [sighs] She's at home, where she belongs. [footsteps] [Judy sobs] [door creaks and opens] [door shuts] What's going on? Huh, baby? Are you all right? We're getting out of here. Where is he? It's over. Please tell me what's going on, Neil. You were right. It was work. He had a grudge against Karl. So, what was Judy doing in there? What? I thought I saw Judy at the window! Look, I told you, didn't I? Ok, it was work. Yes, but what was Judy doing there? Look, it's complicated! This could cause a lot of trouble. For the company... The company... Karl... Are you kidding me? You've got to be... No, I'm not kidding! Just tell me what's going on, please. You really want to know the truth? Yes. You want to know why he did it? Yes! Just tell me! [gears shift] It was me he was after. Why? He's Judy's husband. And? She's been having an affair... With Karl. Only that maniac. Thought it was with me. Can you believe it? No, what matters right now is Sophie. He said she's at home. We just gotta get back. Uh-huh. Make sure she's ok. Ok. Yeah. Ok. What are you doing... What are you doing? I need a cigarette. I'll get it... I'll get it. [engine revs] [tires squeal] [lock clicks] [door shuts] Look down here, I'll check upstairs. [whispering] Sophie? Sophie? Sophie. Sophie. Oh, god, baby come here, come here. Oh, baby. [Crying] Are you ok? Daddy? Yeah? [normal voice] did she hurt you? What? The woman... Who took you. [whispering] did she hurt you? We played hide-and-go-seek. Oh, come here, baby. Mommy and daddy...

Look me in the eyes and lie to me again. Oh, no. Lying. I'm not lying... Tell me you love me. [whispers] I do love you, Abby. Listen to me, Abby. Ok? You and I, we... we can work this out together. We can get through this. And I'll make it up to you. But we... we almost lost our daughter today. And we have her back. They took Sophie. And we... did they? But you know... Well, you know they did. Woman on telephone: We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please check the number. And dial again. We know it's just a game, honey. Ok, just do whatever the lady says, all right? Oh, Neil. She never left the house. [bangs] She had a nice day... With a lovely sitter. I made sure that I got the best. Only the best. You set me up. You set me up from the start. Little old me. Can you believe it? And you... And you put me through all of that? How about this, Neil? How about weeks and months of knowing. You're not good enough? Try that! Abby! It didn't mean anything! You gotta believe me. I do believe you. I believe you. But it meant something to me. And it meant something to him. Enough that you would let him destroy. Every cent we've worked for? No, Neil. Not every cent. So, you just ruined my career. Did I? Yes, I saw you do that one, Abby. And what did you see, Neil? None of it happened. So you got it? Yeah. Quite a performance. I found you out, Neil. Just like I did in Denver. I have been in so much pain. Do you know how that feels? Watching you sleep at night, Watching you dream. And knowing that she watches you, too. [sighs] I'm done. I get you. I understand you. But I don't want you. Look, you still have everything. You still have your house, You still have your career, You'll always have Sophie. Everything's exactly as it was. Except for one thing. Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel? I do, Neil. I just wanted to share those feelings. With you, if only for a few hours. Despair, loss, Abandonment, Betrayal. Are they there, Neil? Are they, baby? Are they?
