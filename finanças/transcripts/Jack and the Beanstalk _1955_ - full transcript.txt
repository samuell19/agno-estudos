NARRATOR: This story happened long, long ago. ln the country lived a poor widow and her son Jack. Their only possession was a fine fat pig. And one day the widow decided that she must sell the pig. She told Jack to take the pig to market and to be sure to get the best price he could for it. So off went Jack and the pig to market. Suddenly the pig stopped, and Jack stopped. And they looked. And there, just on the edge of the forest, they saw a little old man with a long, grey beard. (LAUGHlNG) l've got it! l've got it! All the riches in the world! l got it by digging. lf you dig, you find. All the riches in the world! This was more than the pig could stand. He thought he'd have a try. He can dig! Will you sell him? l'll give you all the riches in the world! This was a bargain. He couldn't get it better. All the riches in the world for one fat pig. Proudly, Jack showed his mother what he had got, all the riches in the world. ''Beans? ''Our fine fat pig for beans!'' But the beans were not ordinary beans, and they grew and grew and grew and grew. And grew. Jack wanted to climb the beanstalks, but his mother was frightened. Jack stared in amazement at the wonderful castle in the sky. lt was really a giant's castle but how was Jack to know that? (HARP PLAYlNG) lt was the giant's daughter who was playing on a magic harp. lt is a lonely life, being a giant's daughter, and so she was delighted to see Jack. She'd never even seen a man before, let alone a handsome young man like Jack. ''A little drink to celebrate?'' (GlANT GROANlNG) That sounds like trouble. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHlNG) Look here, a magic hen. The eggs are of gold. (GlANT SNlFFlNG) l smell... l smell... Fee, fie, fo, fum, l smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive or be he dead, l'll grind his bones to make my bread! l smell him still! l know he's here! l smell him in my glass of beer. (EXCLAlMlNG) (GRUNTlNG) (EXCLAlMlNG) (GRUNTlNG) (GRUNTS ) (GRUNTlNG) Quietly, Jack snatched up the magic hen and fled. (GlANT EXCLAlMlNG) Stop, thief! Stop! Stop, Englishman! (GlANT EXCLAlMlNG) And the giant and the beanstalks crashed to the ground and they never rose again. ''Mother, look! lt's a magic hen! And the eggs are of gold!'' This was better than the bag of beans and even better than a fine fat pig. ln fact, if they worked fast and the hen didn't wear out, they might really get all the riches in the world.
