[INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Mary, bring us a couple of more beers. Mom, can we go play in the canyon? We'll be back before dinner, I promise. No. It's almost dinnertime now and it's really too dark for you guys to go wandering off. Oh, come on, Mom. It's not very far. Just over here in the rocks. Well you'll have to ask your father. Okay. Hey, wait a minute! Here. Take these to your father. And no sips! Well, thanks, boys. Hey. Dad, can me and Doug go play up in the canyon for a few minutes? Doug says he knows where there's a real live skeleton. A real live skeleton, huh? [LAUGHS] Okay. But you make sure you're back in time for dinner. We will. Thanks, Dad! Did you really see a skeleton? Uh-huh. And a real one too. From a man. Ah, you did not. I was here with you, remember? I didn't see anything. This was this morning before you got up. I got up early to catch some lizards and I climbed up this ledge, and it was just laying there. What ledge? Up there. Ah, there's nothing up there but rocks. I don't see any skeleton. You can't see it from down here. I told you. It's on a ledge. Okay. I'll bet you $5 there's nothing up there. And if you're wrong, you better pay off. Don't worry, you'll see. BOY: Come on, hurry up! It's getting dark fast They'll be mad if we're not back in time for dinner. Maybe we should wait until tomorrow. I don't like it out here in the dark. I figured you'd try to back out of it. Now, remember, we made a bet. Now, come on. Okay, I'm coming. BOY: Did you see anything else here besides a skeleton? DOUG: I didn't get a chance to see. Why not? DOUG: Because I was scared. BOY: Aw, there's nothing up here. You're just trying to keep me from winning the bet. Okay, then you go and look. Uh-uh. We're in this fifty-fifty. BOY: And besides, an old skeleton can't hurt you anyway. Now, come on. Help! Help! Help! Help! [BOTH SCREAMING] [BOTH CRYING AND SCREAMING] [BOTH SCREAMING] MAIN TITLE [CHURCH BELL TOLLING] Morning, Tom. Oh, good morning, dean. Good morning, Dr. Parkinson. Hi, Sue. Oh, Sue. I read your term paper last night. Very good. Thank you. [VOICE OVER THE PA] Attention, all Zoology 2 students. Professor Carey's Wednesday classes will meet in room 421. Oh, hi, Tom. Anything good today? Morning, Howard. I'm not sure. Got a letter here from Mohave County Sheriff's Department. Oh, what did you do? Murder somebody or forget to pay a parking ticket? [CHUCKLES] Oh, hell. Another one from the phone company. thought I had paid that thing. [CHUCKLES] I'll be damned. Oh, bad news? No, good. Need an authority on rattlesnakes and they're willing to pay me $200 to go out there and consult with them tomorrow. What would I do with my classes? Oh, to hell with your classes. Your teaching assistant. That's what they're there for. Besides, the university doesn't pay $200 for teaching three classes. That's for sure. Hey, um, what's the latest word on your federal grant? Been approved, but funds haven't come through. We've only got 10 days before the spring break. I'll be glad when you get a lab of your own and take all those snakes out of the bio lab. I get the willies walking through there at night. What are you worried about, Howard? Rattlesnakes give you warning before they strike. I think I'll stick to working with birds. They don't strike at all. I'll see you later. All right. [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] BIOLOGY LAB HOWARD: Good evening, Sam. Your cart always gives you away. This is no cart. This is my security blanket on wheels. You know something? I don't like working around Dr. Parkinson's snakes. I don't blame you. SAM: Another late night? I've gotta finish up some data on an experiment. Are you still working where the pigeons go through the maze? No. This one's a little bit different. Come on in. I'll show you. Over here, we have some pigeons living under normal conditions. This group over here has been subjected to variations in light and temperature. One day it's hot and dark, the next, it's cold and light. And this chaotic type of environment creates stress. So far, the results indicate that the birds under stress eat a lot more. In human terms, they get fat. I could have told you that 10 years ago. Oh? Yeah, I'm married to one of those fat pigeons. Hopefully these studies of pigeons will lead to a cure for obesity in humans. I hope it's before I end up with a 500-pound canary. [HOWARD LAUGHS] Has Dr. Parkinson been in yet? SAM: Not yet. Don't you ever go home? [SAM] Well, not when there's work to be done. HOWARD: Maybe eight hours a day behind a broom and a gold watch after 30 years isn't so bad. At least I get to go home. Of course I don't make so much money as you. Well, if you measure by per hour, I'm sure you make more than I. Don't let my wife hear you say that. Or she'll figure I'm actually rich and switch from French fries to imported chocolate. SAM: See you tomorrow, professor. Good night, Sam. That wasn't so bad, was it, huh? Hey, you know you're getting fat, huh? Hmm. Four more ounces, Mable. Hey. You're pleasingly pump, huh? Howard, are you still here? Howard, don't move. One of my cobras is out of its cage and he's behind you. Now, I want you to stand perfectly still. TOM: I'm gonna move in behind him, try and distract his attention. TOM: Just don't make any sudden moves. [PIGEON SQUAWKING] TOM: Howard, keep those birds still. HOWARD: I'm having trouble keeping myself still. [PIGEON COOING] TOM: Freeze, Howard. Do as I say. I said freeze. Tom, I think I'm gonna pass out. You do and you'll be dead in a matter of minutes, Howard. HOWARD: My knees are getting weak. Concentrate on something else. Concentrate on your pigeons. Hurry. Hold it, Howard. HOWARD: You got him? TOM: Almost. [BIRDS CHIRPING AND PIGEON COOING] TOM: Easy, baby. TOM: Easy. TOM: I got him. Howard? Howard. You can move now, Howard. Come on, Howard. Howard, are you all right? Yeah, I think so. But I'd feel a lot better if you'd get some locks on those snake cages. Or better yet, take them with you to the desert when you go. By the way, when are you going? TOM [CHUCKLES]: In the morning. Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee. HOWARD [CHUCKLES]: You'd better make that a drink. A double. SHERIFF Then they told me that you were the man to see about rattlesnakes. And since you were in L.A., thought you might be able to help. Well, I hope I can, sheriff. Frankly, I was expecting to see some dried up old desert rat with snakebite scars all over his body. Harry, open up the vault, will you? Well, I've been bitten twice. And believe me, sheriff, that's enough for me. It doesn't hurt to be overcautious when dealing with any kind of venomous snakes. After seeing these two kids we brought in, I sure agree. There was an old man we found in the desert last month I wish you could have seen. All swollen with the same type snakebites as these. At least we thought they were snakebites. Maybe you can tell better after you look. Strictly closed coffin stuff. We've been holding off releasing their bodies to their families for burial until you had a look at them. Mind if we get some air? Sure. Thanks, Harry. Sorry about the smell in that place. Yeah. It wasn't that so much as seeing those kids all disfigured like that. I'll tell you something. I've handled hundreds of snakebite cases, but nothing like this. Then it definitely was snakebite, huh? What was it, a rattler? Judging from the breadth and depth of the punctures, I'd say it was definitely a rattlesnake, but more likely a number of them. Isn't it kind of strange, those kids being bitten so many times? And what about that old man? Well, it's not at all uncommon for a dozen or a hundred rattlesnakes to gather in one place. But they usually only do it during hibernation. You have a map of where the bodies were found? Yeah, sure. Now, let's see. Yeah. We found the old man right about in here, and the kids around there. You didn't find anything unusual around where the old man was? Coffee? Thanks. Yeah, one thing did seem strange. He had a horse hair rope around his bedroll. You know, I didn't think a snake would cross that. That's just an old miner's tale, sheriff. We've tried that stuff in the lab and it doesn't bother them at all. But what is unusual is the fact that he was apparently attacked in his sleep. Which is highly unlike the behavior of a rattlesnake or any other reptile for that matter. Why is that? Well, reptiles just aren't naturally aggressive. Even a rattlesnake won't attack unless you get too close. You know how far away you can hear rattles. I'm surprised the old man didn't hear them. I've never heard of a rattlesnake making an unprovoked attack on a man before. Well, it sure looks that way. TOM: I'd like to take a look at that canyon where the kids were found. Think we might be able to get out there tonight? I'm gonna be tied up in a meeting in about half an hour, but one of my deputies will take you anywhere you wanna go. TOM: That would be great. Maybe we'll find more clues. I sure hope we get rid of those snakes, so we can have a little peace around here. You know, if it isn't the board of supervisors on my back, it's the newspapers hounding me for a story. TOM: I know what you mean. Well, I'll do my best. Think it's the right road, but hard to tell from the map. I thought you guys knew this area inside and out. Not me. I've just been on the force a year. Grew up in Alabama. What are you doing here in the middle of nowhere? I've never heard of a Mohave County officer being shot and the money's not bad. So here I am. I've got a good-looking wife, two kids, the car's paid off, and we just bought a boat. Sounds like you've got it made. Yeah. Well, it has its ups and downs. Hey, here's the canyon up here on the left. You think you can get in there with this car? Yeah, most of the way. Hey, what exactly are you looking for? Anything that looks out of the ordinary. Well, this whole thing looks out of the ordinary. Like some nightmare. The old lady screaming out of her mind and the old man just sitting there staring off into space. Anybody checked that ledge up there? No. But there weren't any snakes here that we could see. I'm gonna have a look up there. Why don't you check in all around here and see what you can find? [RATTLING] [RATTLING] [RATTLING] Whoa, man! [CHUCKLES] It's only me. Sorry. You ready to go? Yeah. Find anything? No, nothing. You? I found this piece of cloth up on that ledge. Now, it looks like it's got blood stain on it. So if the blood type matches those kids, then they must have been killed up there, rolled down to where the parents found them. Yeah, but you didn't find any snakes. I figure they must have run across a rattlesnake den. You know what, I always thought that dens were underground, you know, like snake pits. Usually, but like last summer, there was this water skier in Texas. Lost it going into a turn. By the time the boat came around to pick him up, he was laying face down, dead. Must have fallen into a nest full of Delta water moccasins. Because he had snakebites all over his body. Hundreds of them. Sure know how to ruin a guy's weekend. Why's that? What are you doing this weekend? Water skiing. Rick! Rick! Do you have to make so much noise? I'm sorry, Ma. A new muffler. Dad helped me put them on. Well, they don't sound too new to me. Will you try to keep it down a little? Okay. And wash up your hands. Supper's almost ready. Tell your father to wash up too. He's down feeding the horses. Well, run on down and hurry him along or you'll both be having cold supper. Okay. Come on, Duke, let's go get Dad. Come on, Duke! Come on, boy! Duke? Duke, wake up, boy. [RATTLING] Dad, are you in there? [RATTLING] [RATTLING] Dad, is that you? [RICK SCREAMS] [MAN ON THE TV] That's it for today's farm report. [BREAKING] And now back to more-- Rick. For the Lord's sake, be careful. Plenty enough we need without you always breaking what little we got. Did you wash your hands? Rick! [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [CRYING] [SCREAMS] [CRYING] [SCREAMING AND CRYING] Please. TOM: Now, in order to compensate for the lack of a cochlea, the tongue picks up acute auditory vibrations and sends them to the bottom of the mouth to the Jacobson organ. [PHONE RINGING] This is-- Oh. Here, we'll take a break and get back to the auditory system in a minute. Herpetology, Tom Parkinson. Yeah, Tom. Listen, this is Sheriff Gates. Oh, hi, sheriff. GATES [OVER THE PHONE]: Something's come up out at Frank Samuel's place. The barn's been burned, the whole family's been killed, even the livestock. Guess what? It looks like the snakes again. I've been talking to the board about hiring you to help us finish up this case if you're interested. Oh, I'm interested all right. What would I have to do? GATES: We're gonna have to get on top of this thing, find out where those snakes are so we can get rid of them. They're gonna want a written report on what you come up with and some photos for documentation. Well, that seems like a lot to do. I'm gonna be tied up with classes until Friday. I don't know whether I can handle it. I'm not very good with a camera. GATES: Say we got somebody to handle photography and help you with the paperwork? When do you think you could start? Hmm. Friday morning at the earliest. TOM: Classes are over Thursday, and then we've got 10 days off for spring break. Good. Okay, if there aren't any problems, I'll look for you in my office on Friday about, what, noon? Yeah, that's fine with me. Okay, thank you, sheriff. Bye-bye. TOM: All right, let's get back to that auditory system. Hi, Rogers. How are you? Hey, how it going? All right. Sheriff in? He should be here any minute now. If you've got an appointment, he usually runs consistently seven minutes late. Yeah, I used to have a watch like that. Hey, how was your water skiing? Great skiing, man, and no water moccasins. I'm glad to hear it. Hi. Is Sheriff Gates in? I'm Ann Bradley, photographer. Not my photographer? ANN: All I know is that it has something to do with research documentation in the desert. Oh, well, I see you two have met. Tom, Ann, come to my office and we'll go over everything. Sheriff, mayor called twice. Wants you to call him back and Mrs. Carmichael-- Okay, okay. I'll take care of it. You can see what it's been like around here. Ann, I told you we had a job for you in the desert. Now, you'll be working with Dr. Parkinson here. Now, he's with the University of California, helping us to investigate a series of accidents. Now, he's gonna be in complete charge of this phase of the investigation. He'll fill you in on all the details, okay? Now, I hope you don't mind roughing it. Do I have a choice? GATES: Not really. [CHUCKLES] Won't be any motels where you're going. Besides, we're very short on funds. We can't afford either one of you really. But Dr. Parkinson has agreed to work for a nominal fee and they tell me that he's the best in his field. What is his field? Herpetology. What's that? Reptiles. I specialize in rattlesnakes. How charming. That's what this thing is all about. Now, Tom has all the details, and he'll fill you in, okay? Look, good sheriff, can I talk to you for a minute? Outside? Look, Tom. If it's about-- It's important. Okay, I'll meet you in the hallway. Be right back, Ann. I can't take that girl out there. I've gotta have somebody that can take care of themselves. Look, Tom. Look, I know you feel. And I agree with you, but this is the only way I could swing it. Look, you know we're short on funds. Every damn women's lib group is on our backs about job equality. GATES: And this girl has worked for us before, and she's really strictly a pro. Look, she spent two years in Vietnam as a press photographer. And she'll be able to handle herself okay. Yeah, well, I hope you're right. Believe me. She's a better photographer than most of the men we've used and a hell of a lot prettier if I might add. Sheriff, this just came in. Uh-oh. More trouble. A glider pilot came down near Silver Lake last night. They have him at the hospital here in town. He, uh-- He says he was attacked. Attacked? By snakes. ANN: Then I realized that if I stayed with the press, I'd be doing the same thing 10 years from now. Because all the promotions and executive positions are held by men. TOM: Come on now. I can't believe they're all-- ANN: Sure there are office jobs for women like typing and taking shorthand. Or do you wanna work at a switchboard eight hours a day saying, "Hello Mr. Jones. Just a moment, Mr. Jones." TOM: Excuse me. Could you tell me where David Ellister's room is? Certainly. That's room 148. Just down the hall, sir. Thank you. [VOICE OVER THE PA] Dr. Couprah. Dr. Couprah. Now, those women seem very happy in their jobs. Sure. How many men can you find to change sheets or empty bedpans? Oh, come off it. Tell me, doctor, how many professors in your department are women? None. But that doesn't mean there couldn't be. See? You're just like the rest of them. The reason there aren't any women in good jobs is because the jobs don't exist. Well, I'm sorry. I can't agree with that. Of course you can't. Because it's men like you who make it that way. And boy, men make all the choices. Oh, is that right? Yes! Well, let me tell you something, young lady. If I had my choice in the matter, you'd be sitting on your liberated ass in that Sheriff's Department, instead of out here with me where you don't belong. Look, I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean to blow up at you like that. But what I meant was you have your job and you should be happy. Oh, I'm happy. [OVER THE PA] Dr. Levinson... Excuse me. Are you David Ellister? Sure am. I'm Tom Parkinson. Hi Tom. Ann Bradley. Hello. Well, hello. Are you two with the press or something? We're with the Sheriff's Department. We're investigating snakebite cases. And I understand you were attacked by snakes? You'd better believe it. There must have been 50 of them. Could you tell us what happened and Miss Bradley will take notes? That is if she doesn't mind. Well, I'd been airborne most of the afternoon. About 6:30, I radioed in for a tow because I didn't have enough lift to make it back to the field. So I set her down, opened the canopy, got out, walked back by the tail. And about that time, I heard some kind of buzzing noises. Like the-- Those mariachi. You know, those things they use in the Latin bands. Then I saw the snakes coming along the ground right towards me. There were dozens of them. Well, I turned and ran for the cockpit, but there was one coiled on the ground in front of me, and I had to jump over him to get in. And I felt a sharp pain in my leg, and I knew he got me. But I dove into the cockpit because by then, the rest of them were right on my tail. My leg felt heavy. And as I pulled it in, I could see he was still hanging on to me with his fangs buried in my calf. I grabbed ahold of him, but he hung on like a vice. Then he let go, he spun around and tried to bite me in the hand too. He was thrashing his body all over the cockpit. I finally got him outside, threw him as hard as I could. He hit the ground and I closed the canopy. What did you do then? Luckily the tow plane arrived a few minutes later. Brought me in. Boy, my leg felt like it was on fire. You were really lucky. You say there were 50 snakes? Oh. Well, maybe not 50. Twenty or 30 anyway. They were all over out there. Tell me, did they move in an S shape manner or kind of like a corkscrew? [LAUGHS] Hell, I don't know. What do you need that for? Tell us whether we're dealing with a diamondback or a sidewinder. Oh, yeah. Well, no. They seemed to come pretty much straight towards me. It's hard to tell. It was almost dark. I couldn't even describe the one on my leg, except that it was a rattlesnake and a mean one. that's all right. You've been a big help to us. Appreciate it. Oh, one last thing. I wonder if you could point out on this map where the glider landed. DAVID: Sure. Uh, it was right there. Boy, I tell you one thing. If I miss the field again after dark, I'm gonna stay in the cockpit until a tow plane arrives. TOM: I know what you mean. Well, thanks again. Appreciate it. DAVID: Glad to help. Say, if you'd like to gliding sometime, just let me know. We'll do that. Thank you. Good. I recorded the conversation. Want any pictures? No, I don't think so. Excuse me, sir. I have a form for you to sign. Well, we know where to get ahold of him if you do. Yeah. Providing he doesn't kill himself in that glider of his. Yeah, or get attacked by any more snakes. Did you believe those things he was saying? I believe he's telling the truth. It's the logic behind the attack that bothers me. I wanna check out that area where the glider landed if we can get there before it gets dark. [VOICE OVER THE PA] EKG technician. ANN: You know what? TOM: What's that? ANN: I don't think were gonna make it by dark. TOM: I think you're right. Not too much farther, though. TOM: See those big rocks ahead? ANN: Yeah. Is that where the glider came down? TOM: No. Thought we'd set up camp here tonight, check that first thing in the morning. ANN: Well, it's not exactly the Hilton, but at least there won't be any smog. Or anything else for that matter. [WESTERN MUSIC PLAYING OVER THE RADIO] BIG VALLEY PLUMBING Come on in. Finally. Do you know I called your office over four hours ago? I'm sorry, but my partner's been sick, and I've been going all day. What seems to be the problem? Well, there's absolutely no hot water. I can't even take a bath. Sounds like the pilot may have gone out. Which way is your water heater? I think it's in there. I don't know, really. I'm not very mechanical. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING OVER THE TV] My husband used to take care of these sort of things before we got divorced. Oh, I'm sorry. I mean, about the divorce and all. No need to feel sorry for me. We never got along anyway. Probably better-off without him. DAVID: Hey, don't turn that off! Just trying to earn enough money to get out of here and move back to San Diego. BROTHER: Mom will be mad at you if you don't turn it off. DAVID: I don't care. I wanna see it. David, I told you turn that TV off and get ready for bed. DAVID: Just a few more minutes. Excuse me a minute. DAVID: Mom! WOMAN: Do you got that fixed yet? PLUMBER: No. It looks like your regulator valve. Great. How much is that gonna cost? Oh, they're not too bad. About 7.50, plus labor. It'll probably be about $20 altogether. I'll have to get under the house to fix it, so is there an access someplace? There's some sort of thing out back if that's what you mean. It will take a while to fix this thing, so if you wanna get some hot water, you'd better heat some up on the stove. Okay. [RATTLING] [SCREAMS] [RATTLING] David! Is that you? [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Good morning. ANN: Good morning. Hey, you know, my things are still wet from last night? Well, don't worry. The sun will dry it out in no time at all. I believe it. Have you been up long? About an hour. I wanna get this stuff set up before it got too warm. You take coffee? Yes, thank you. You know, it's really beautiful out here. You should have seen these hills about two weeks ago. They were just covered with wildflowers for as far as you could see. Hey, I bet you're hungry. How'd you like some bacon and eggs? That is if you've brought any. Oh, I brought everything all right, but I wasn't so sure you could cook. I'm not so hot myself. Are you kidding? I was the oldest of seven kids. When my father died and my mother had to go to work, I learned to do all the cooking. Oh, I'm no Betty Crocker, but my bacon and eggs are good. Well, with that kind of a childhood, I'm sure you're better than I am. You know what I guess really bothered me was seeing my mother working in a factory for minimum wage. When I was little, I remember holding her hands, and they were so soft. ANN: But after a few years of working with those machines, they became calloused. And it seemed every night she came home, she aged another year. Well, I don't think you'll ever have to worry about that. I hope not. Well, I don't wanna be an old maid, but I don't wanna give up my career either. Maybe you won't have to. You really like freelancing, don't you? ANN [CHUCKLES]: I love it. Oh, you can starve in between jobs, though. Well, speaking of starving, we better eat and check out where that glider landed or we're gonna lose our jobs with the Sheriff's Department. Okay. TOM: This looks like the place. Why don't you check around over in there? Here's some tire tracks. There are a lot of footprints too. I think this is the place all right. I was hoping to find some snake tracks. What do they look like? Well, they're little swirly lines, kind of like a river bend. I sure don't see any. That's the trouble. First good rain or windstorm that comes along, they get washed out. What are you doing? I'm just noticing. Look here. Mm-hm. This is where we are. And the kids were found right about here. And the old man was over here. Farm house is up somewhere in here. Mm-hm. Now if you draw a connecting line between all these points, look where it winds up. Hmm. Fort Walton. But what's that? It's an old Army base that they don't use much any more. I doubt if we'll find anything out, but maybe we ought to check it out. Somebody might have seen something unusual. Okay, but how about a picture first, huh? And a smile? FORT WALTON RESTRICTED AREA Morning. We're working with the Sheriff's Department. I'd like to see the commanding officer if possible. Now, that would be Colonel Stroud. Could I see your identification, please? Yeah. [SOLDIERS CHANTING] Well, I'm sorry, but no one's allowed on the base without a security clearance. I could call his office and let him know you're here. I'd appreciate that. Yeah. There's a Dr. Parkinson and a Miss Bradley to see the colonel. MP: They're with the Sheriff's Department. Right. Okay. You'll find Colonel Stroud's office in building N up ahead. Uh, you can park up there in front. Be sure not to go beyond that fence. A restricted area. Okay. Thanks a lot. [DOOR KNOCKS] TOM: Morning. Colonel Stroud? ASSISTANT: Right this way. Aah. You must be Dr. Parkinson. Hi. My assistant's name is Bradley. How do you do? Hello, colonel. You're with the Sheriff's Department? Not exactly. We've been hired by the Sheriff's Department to investigate some cases of snakebite death. I see. Uh, you wanna know about Billings? About who? Billings. Corporal Billings. Uh, my men who died of snakebite. Isn't that why you're here? Well, frankly, colonel, the sheriff never told us anybody had been killed here. We normally don't report any deaths to the civilian authorities unless it involves a crime or civilian personnel. TOM: Your medical officer find more than one snakebite on a man's body? You didn't have to be a doctor to see that. He looked like a pincushion. Well, didn't that seem rather unusual to you? A lot of things that go on seem unusual to me. And I'm sure no commanding officer likes losing any of his men. But it does happen. I lost one of my officers two months ago. Took his own life with a shotgun. Not very nice either, but what can you do? How long ago was this man Billings killed? Two weeks ago, the 22nd. TOM: I guess his body has been shipped home? COLONEL STROUD: Of course. if there's anything you need to know, I'm sure you can find it in his 4211. 4211? Form 4211, certificate of death. Not much to represent a man's life, but that's what we have. You're sure he died of snakebite? Well, it sure as hell wasn't the flu. It was unusual the number of bites he had. Must have been nearly a dozen. You know exactly where the body was found? About half a mile from the base. Almost due east. Well, the time of death indicated here was just after midnight. What was he doing out there at that hour? Can I offer you a drink? Pure alcohol. Driest martinis in town. [CHUCKLES] No thanks. Uh, the colonel probably wouldn't want you to know this, but Billings had a girl in Barstone. Apparently had been going over the fence several nights a week. I still don't see how he got past the patrols. Or I'd go myself. Patrols? Security patrols. They patrol the perimeter to make sure no one gets into the base at night. Or out of it either. Last year, they caught two kids taking parts off a truck. Someone even tried to steal a helicopter. That reminds me, I was gonna ask Colonel Stroud about borrowing a helicopter. What do you think my chances will be? Not very good, really, but it depends on his mood. Well, there's the phone. See for yourself. Just dial 236. Colonel, this is Tom Parkinson again. Yeah. I'm in their office now. Did you find out anything? Seems to fit with the other cases. They're all multiple snakebites. Well, I hope you can get rid of those snakes. You could be a big help to us if you would, colonel. I always try to help civilian authorities when I can. What can I do? I need a helicopter and pilot for about an hour to check some spots. It'd save us days of climbing and driving. It's not a general practice to lend equipment to civilians, but I think we can make an exception in this case. TOM: Thank you. I appreciate that, colonel. Go down to the landing pad. I'll have the duty pilot sent out right away. I'll get right down there. And thank you very much again. Bye-bye. Well, it looks like I caught him in a good mood. How do I get down to that landing pad? Uh, just go out the door and to the right. You can't miss it. Okay. What about me? I'm not going? Well, why don't you stay here with Captain Delaney? That is if he doesn't mind. Mind? Listen, professor, any time you wanna leave me alone with a sexy-looking young thing like Miss Bradley here, fine with me. Well, maybe she could photograph the death certificate and the area where Billings was found. If you don't mind taking her out there. Well, I'd be glad to, but I can't desert the infirmary. That's okay. If you'll give me directions, I'll just take the jeep. TOM: You don't mind going alone? No, I don't mind. All right. See you later. Thank you very much. Okay, we'll need a map. Now, this is the base road here. You follow it out till you see a gully. Follow the gully out about half a mile. That's a hell of a sensation up here. [LAUGHS] You like that, huh? TOM: Yeah. I think if we head out in this direction, we'll pass over my campsite. And there's a road about 3 miles out. PILOT: That's 127. Let's follow it out to the end. There's a canyon out there. TOM: This thing really moves out. Oh, we have faster ones. [CHUCKLES] Of course, you've got the fastest pilot in the West. TOM [CHUCKLES]: I believe it. Okay, we're up on that canyon. You wanna land in it? No, let's just circle around slowly if you can. PILOT: You've got it. TOM: I don't think there's anything here. Why don't we just head on due east, okay? We'll check that out. I don't know what it is you're looking for. Man, there's nothing on here but sand and mesquite. PILOT: I've got seven more months to do, and then I never wanna see any sand again. Unless maybe at the beach. TOM: You're gonna give up flying too? Are you kidding? I'm just giving up the uniforms and the regulations. PILOT: Hell, man. I'm the best pilot they've got here. Like last month, they get this big emergency rush job to bury this container out here. They say, "George, we want you to treat this thing like it was an egg." Man, I feathered those blades, set that thing down so soft. Didn't even know it was moved. [RATTLING] Wait a minute. Did you say something about burying something out here? Yeah. But it was further west of here. Well, what was it you buried? [CHUCKLES] You've got me. Whatever it was, it's under about a ton of concrete now. What do you mean? There was this old mine shaft they put it in. I lowered it down in, and they covered it up with cement. Could you fly me over there? Well, I can try, but, uh, it won't do much good. It's all covered over by now, and we'd never find it. I'm sure Colonel Stroud could tell you where it is, though. TOM: Okay, well, I'll tell you I wanna check a farm out that's out by Hinkley, and then we can head back in, all right? PILOT: Right. [RATTLING] [ANN SCREAMS] There's a snake in my jeep. Let me take a look. Well, if there was a snake in there before, it's gone now. Are you sure it's gone? Positive. But if you want a ride, I'd be glad to take you anywhere you want. ANN: No, that's okay. Thanks anyway. Probably just my imagination. I'd like to see Colonel Stroud. Well, I'm sorry, sir, but he's busy right now. That's all right. I'll wait. He may be busy for several hours. He asked not to be disturbed. Could you call, tell him it's important? It'll just take a minute. Well, I can try. But he's not gonna like this. Sir, Dr. Parkinson is back and insists on seeing you. Says it's important. All right, sergeant, send him in. All right, you can go in. Now look here, Parkinson. I've gone out of my way to help you. But when you come barging in, insisting on seeing me, I think you're overstepping your bounds. After all, this is a government facility. Sheriff's Department has no jurisdiction here. It has when you're endangering the lives of civilians. Now, what are you talking about? Check the records. There's never been one civilian fatality or even an injury due to any of our aircraft or personnel. I'm talking about whatever it is you have buried in that mine shaft. Who told you about that? Well, it doesn't matter who told me or who's responsible. The point is I wanna know what's in that mine shaft because it might have something to do with these snakebite cases. Well, I don't see any connection. All we did was bury an old container in an uninhabited area. I think people would be glad to have that open mine shaft filled in before some kid fell into it. TOM: Exactly what was in that container? I'm sorry, that's classified information, but I can guarantee there's no danger to anyone. If it wasn't something dangerous, then why bury it in the first place? And why all the concrete? I don't have to answer your questions, Parkinson. And I see no evidence of anything we've done here that would cause you to ask it. Colonel, people have been killed, and I'm trying to find out why. Now, all I wanna know is where that mine shaft is located and what it is that's buried there. It's not as if I'm some kind of spy or something. Sergeant, Dr. Parkinson is leaving. Would you please escort him to the gate? All right, I'll go. Don't think you've heard the last of this. We're not gonna be far away. And believe me, I'm gonna find out what's going on around here. TOM: So when I mentioned the mine shaft, he clammed up right up as if he was scared or something. We ought to do a little probing around tomorrow if we can get back on that base. Captain Delaney might be able to help. He seemed pretty cooperative. I think he's cooperative because he likes you. Ha, ha, do I detect a note of jealousy? Well, aren't you going to ask what we were doing while you were gone? I hope you were taking some pictures or the sheriff's not gonna be too happy. No, actually we were having a torrid affair. He swept me right off my feet and we made wild, passionate love right there between the cotton swabs and the aspirin. But we did it in the name of science, so I didn't think you'd mind. I don't mind, as long as he's your type. ANN: He's actually not my type at all. Did you know that his specialty was biomedicine? Really? Mm-hm. Why would they put a biomed man way out here? Something strange about that base too. All that security, and for what? ANN: Well, I did manage to get some pictures of those buildings they kept us out of. When we get back to camp, I'll process the film. Can you do that out here? Sure. I have a portable dark room that works great in a tent. There's only one drawback. What's that? You have to wait until it gets dark. You wanted to see me, sir. Yes, Hawkins. You were the duty helicopter pilot this morning, is that right? Yes, sir. STROUD: And you took Dr. Parkinson up, is that right? Yes, sir. Well, what I wanna know is exactly where did Dr. Parkinson wanna go? PILOT: Well, let's see. First, he had me circle this canyon at the end of 127. Then we flew east for a while, and he looked around. Uh, then we sat down on that farm that burned over near Hinkley and came back. Do you know what he was looking for? No, sir. He didn't say, and I figured it was none of my business. Well, what about that old mine shaft? Did he ask about that? Yes, sir. I told him I didn't know where and he should ask you about it. You know, Hawkins, divulging classified information to civilians is a court marshal offense. I didn't divulge anything, sir. I just took him out and brought him back. Well, from now on, I think it would be a good idea if you refrained from talking to Dr. Parkinson at all. And to forget that there ever was a mine shaft. Now, I realize that you only have a few more months of active duty, and I'd hate to see you spend that time at a lesser rank. But it could happen. I'm sorry, sir, if I said anything wrong, but I won't let it happen again. I promise. Let's make sure of that, eh, Hawkins? PILOT: Yes, sir. That's all, Hawkins. You can go. PILOT: Yes, sir. [WOLF HOWLS] Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. I was just watching you work. Look, it's bad enough being here in the dark without having people sneak up behind you. Sorry, just wanted to see these shots. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell at you. I guess I'm just starting to see snakes everywhere. Yesterday, I was sure there was one behind me. Where was that? When I was getting pictures where that soldier was killed. I got this feeling like someone is staring at you, only there wasn't anyone there. Well, it was probably just a-- No, it was a snake. I'm sure of it. It was like something evil watching me. And then it was in the jeep. [CHUCKLES] Don't go getting all upset. Maybe you did see a snake. But you weren't hurt, were you? No. I'm all right. Look, I guess I'm acting silly, but I just can't help it. I don't think you're silly at all. Now, it's been a long day, tomorrow may be even longer, so I'm gonna zip you up in here and you'll be perfectly safe. Okay? Okay. See you in the morning. [LAUGHING] WOODLEY: What did she say? She said, "If you're so smart, what are you doing in the Army?" I wonder what the hell I'm doing here myself sometimes. Hell, I tell you, it sure beats combat duty. I'd like to get back to where there's some decent women. You wouldn't know a decent woman if one crawled up and bit you. At least I never saw you with one. Hey, you better take it easy on this stuff. After all, you are driving. Don't worry. We can always take a taxi home. WOODLEY: There's no one out here but us. Who's gonna tell? Well, if we did catch somebody stealing a cactus or something, all they've gotta do is tell the colonel his patrol was juiced. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Cactus juice. [LAUGHS] Well, we haven't caught anybody yet, have we? No. Besides that, if we did get caught, we'd get off the night patrol. Yeah, we might just get on-- [BLOWUP] What the hell was that? I don't know. There's something in the road. It felt like a tire blew. Damn. We need to watch it. Hey, Woodley. Hey, come here and look at this. Yeah, that's flat all right. Yeah, yeah, look. You see right here? Look at this little marks. We must have caught a board with nails or something in it. Yeah, I didn't see any board. You're gonna say I'm crazy, but you know all that talk about rattlesnakes around here, that looks just like a snakebite. Come on, no snake can bite through a tire. Man, they can bite through a boot. Oh, quit worrying and get the jack out. Here. PALMER: Hey, you know, maybe we ought to call in for assistance. Hell, no. It's only a flat tire. Come on, jack the damn thing up. I'll get the lugs. Friday the 13th too. [WOODLEY LAUGHS] Boy, you're really something else. I used to think you were bad about all your damned superstitions, but snakes biting through an eight-ply tire, that really beats them all. Wait, let's get this around. WOODLEY: Ah! Ah! Hey. Hey, Woodey. Hey, Woodey. Woodey? Ah-- Ah. [GRUNTING] Dr. Parkinson? Hmm? What? What is it? Could you come to the base right away? Captain Delaney sent me to get you. What, is he crazy? It's only 4:00. There's been an accident. Palmer and Woodley on security patrol. Like they've been killed by snakes. All right, just give me a minute. What is it? What's going on? There's been another attack. Two soldiers this time. Maybe Stroud will listen now. You'd better get your stuff. We've gotta get out of here. Okay. DELANEY: Aw, there you are. I'm sorry to wake you both up so early, I thought you'd wanna take a look at these men before I have to wake the colonel and tell him what happened. Just what happened? Do you know? DELANEY: Not for sure, but it looks like they had a flat tire, stopped to fix it and were hit before they could get away. You're not gonna get in trouble for letting us in here again? Look, don't worry about me. Let's just worry about finding whatever killed these men. Well, let's take a look at the bodies and get some pictures. Oh, my God, that poor man. I don't imagine he suffered much. The amount of venom in his blood, he probably died in a matter of seconds. Why is he so swollen? DELANEY: It's hematoma. Like the swelling from a bruise. Rattlesnake venom does that. It contains an enzyme that destroys the tissues and blood cells. How horrible. DELANEY: There are better ways to go, I suppose. The other man, Woodley, looks about the same. Captain, you know the approximate time of death? DELANEY: About 0200. Now, it's 4:30 now. Think you could have a man take us where the bodies were found? Sure. Excuse me a minute. Hines, I want you to take Dr. Parkinson and Miss Bradley to where you found Palmer and Woodley. TOM: Hoping to get out there before the tracks get covered up. Usually covered up by the wind, but maybe this time we'll be able to find the nest. I hope so. Let me know what happens. I will. And thanks for all your help. Right. HINES: And I was supposed to relieve Palmer at 0400, but they never showed up, so we went looking for them. I wish we hadn't found them now. It wasn't too pretty. Snakebite rarely is. You think snakes did that? I've seen people bit before, and they didn't look like that. Man, those guys were torn all to hell. We figure it was a number of them, not just one. I don't know. You can look for yourselves. Here's their jeep up ahead. Pull up alongside and we'll have a look. My God, there must have been 20 or 30 snakes here. Ann, get a picture of this. I didn't think snakes traveled in groups. They don't usually. Only time I've seen them do it is when they're trying to defend a nest. TOM: Wait a minute. Back up here a minute. TOM: Easy. Recently fired. It's probably from Palmer's gun. It was on the ground near his body. The whole clip had been fired. Do you want me to keep going? Yeah, let's see where these tracks lead. Let's hope they don't lead us to where it led those men. HINES: That makes two of us. Looks like those tracks lead into that mine shaft. Well, let's take a look. TOM: You coming with us? No thanks. I think I'll stay right here with the jeep. TOM: Let me borrow that flashlight, will you? HINES: Sure. I thought the mine you were looking for had been filled in. Well, we won't know till we get inside. They may use those vertical air shafts. You mean we're going in there now? Well, sure. Why not? Well, I don't know. I just thought, uh-- [CHUCKLES] I was beginning to think you were pretty competent. ANN: Tom? TOM: What? ANN: How much further do we have to go? TOM: I don't know. It depends on what we find up ahead. TOM: This way. Wow, this place is weird. ANN: Where does it lead to? Um, let's go down this way. Okay. Just a minute. Tom! Tom, wait. Tom, this isn't gonna cave in on us, is it? I doubt it, but some of these timbers look old, so don't get too near them. Now, watch this. Be careful. TOM: Well, it looks like it goes down a couple hundred feet. [CHUCKLES] I wouldn't want you to fall in there. TOM: Shh. [RATTLING] This way. Come on. [RATTLING] [SCREAMS] TOM: Get out of here! TOM: Get out of here! Get out! TOM: Oh! TOM: Hurry up. Straight through. TOM: Come on. ANN: Can't. ANN: We're trapped! TOM: Don't start now. Come on. We're almost there. ANN: I can't run any further. TOM: Keep running. [ANN SCREAMING] I never thought we could make it. I couldn't take another step. At least we found that den we were looking for. You know you're crazy? Absolutely crazy. Or maybe I'm the one that's crazy. You know I could be working in an office for normal hours and better pay. But no. I have to do everything the hard way. Well, I'll tell you what. I've gotta go over to the county reporter's office to check out this mine. Maybe we'll catch a show, have a big steak. How's that sound? That's the least I can do for you. Las Vegas? Really? Really. Okay. [RATTLING] Tom. Tom! What? Hi. I hear something. Huh? I hear something. It's probably just the wind. No, no. It's something else. All right, I'll go look. ANN: What is it? Snakes. And dozens of them all outside the tent. ANN: Ah! Tom, look! Behind. ANN: Another one. Get it! Oh. TOM: We've gotta get out of here and make a run for the jeep. Oh! Oh, I've been bitten! Tom! SOLDIER: Randall, Galiano, spread out. I'm gonna check inside. [ANN SCREAMS] [SOLDIERS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [ANN SCREAMING] [GUNSHOTS] SOLDIER: I think we've got them all. You all right? Get me that snakebite kit. Patrol 1, this is headquarters. This is patrol 1. I've never seen so many snakes. Colonel Stroud on the radio. He wants to talk to you. Hey, I'll be back in just a minute. You tell Stroud when I get her to the hospital, I'm coming over with a shovel and find out what's buried in that goddamn mine of his! All right, Ann. [LAUGHS] Doing your spring cleaning? What do you want Delaney? I just came to watch the burning of Rome. I don't have time for your drunken antics today. DELANEY: Looks like you don't have much time left at all. But I told you, didn't I? I mean, they're not gonna slap your hand this time. You violated the Geneva convention. My God, do you think the Russians or the Chinese care about the Geneva convention? Hell, they've got biological stockpiles that make this place look like a toy store. But we've got CT3, and they'll never get that. Nobody will. [LAUGHS] Oh, you're precious CT3? That was gonna win the war without firing a shot. [LAUGHS] Well, look what it did to those snakes. Now, you know that was an emergency as well as I do, Delaney. We had a leaking canister and no time for safe disposal. [LAUGHS] And that's another joke. Your safe disposal. They dumped that stuff into the ocean, but what happens when the containers rust through? [LAUGHS] You saw what happened to the snakes? Can you imagine what it will do to sharks and killer whales? You worry a lot for a lush. I only worry when I'm doing something wrong. [LAUGHS] And for the first time in four years I'm not worried. I still have Fletcher's records. You don't think I'm burning them. DELANEY: You don't scare me with that anymore. He died four years ago. So you can't prove I was even drunk. It's just your word against me. You're a lush. Everybody knows that. Now open the door. DELANEY: I'm sorry, Colonel, but I should have stopped you four years ago. I am ordering you to open the door, Delaney. I told you you can't threaten me anymore. I've made my choice. Sheriff, what's going on around here? Oh, come in, Tom. I want you to meet General Hinch. Tom Parkinson, the snake expert I told you about. How do you do? Hello. Where's Colonel Stroud? It looks like he shot and killed the medical officer and took off. Delaney? Guard said he saw him leaving a little while ago with several gas canisters in his jeep. We're trying to locate him now. I've flown in myself to suspend his command until we complete an investigation. Well, he's probably headed for that mine. We were heading out there ourselves. You wanna join us? Yeah. We've gotta get those canisters back. Exactly what was in those canisters, general? From what Sheriff Gates has told me, it looks like CT3. What's that? Colonel Stroud used to be a major figure in the logistics of biological warfare, and CT3 was experimental. Sort of his baby. The project was never completed, and the colonel was transferred to our storage depot here. Yeah, well, what is CT3? Well, it's a new form of nerve gas designed to be dropped behind enemy lines where breathing it caused a manic behavior. Within a few hours, the enemy troops would be fighting and killing amongst their own ranks. And then our forces could move in easily and take over without firing a shot. General Hinch believes that's what the colonel may have buried in the mine. It certainly would explain the behavior of the snakes. I still don't see how it could affect those snakes when it's buried underground. Well, general, a mine shaft houses all sorts of desert life. And in this case, it just happened to be a den of rattlesnakes. Ah, here's my car. Howie! He must be inside the mine up there. Let's cover the area. TOM: I'll head this way. TOM: He's got a gun! Colonel, this is Sergeant Gates! I want you to give it up! Forget it, sheriff! Give me that thing! Stroud, this is General Hinch from RCOM 35! I'm ordering you to come out of there! You're no colonel, you're no general from RCOM 36! I know you! You don't fool me! You commies and your cheap trick! Deceit and disguise! Damn it, he's got grenades! Pull back. EMERGENCY ENTRANCE How's that leg feeling? It feels a lot better. The pain's almost gone. At least it feels a lot better than my stomach. Why is it they always try to starve you in a hospital? I did get to lie on a nice comfortable bed, though. I'd almost forgotten what it was like. And you're not gonna miss that desert air and that sleeping bag? No. Actually, I can't wait to get back home and breathe in a big lungful of good old L.A. smog. Listen to the sounds of traffic and people. TOM: You know you're a hopeless case? ANN: I know. I guess the only thing I will miss will be you. I've gotten used to your crazy ways. Well, you know what they say about crazy people? Hang around them long enough, you get crazy yourself. [LAUGHS] I believe it. I'll tell you what. I know this fantastic Chinese restaurant in L.A. where they serve seven course dinners. Don't care whether you're crazy or not, just so long as you're hungry. Does that sound good? Sounds great. Just so long as there aren't any snakes. Hey, I promise. There won't be any more problems. The mine's gone, the gas is gone. So are the snakes. I hope. [RATTLING]
