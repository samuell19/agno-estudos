[thunder] [spooky music] [Kurt] Edmund Smuts did not rest in peace. He lay down in the dirt But he did not sleep. The sleep of the innocent is not conferred upon a soul so blackened So depraved, so cursed. He walks still between heaven and his awaiting hell. So wrote my ancestor Gladestone Michaels in his journal in 1830. I come from a long line of storytellers, it’s in my blood and this story started 200 years ago When Gladestone, travelling to Van Dieman’s Land in search of adventure and a story to write about found, in his words, a devil. [ music swells] Now, what he didn’t write was that he shot and killed Edmund, shot and killed him at a church altar and married the woman he was about to wed. Edmund was rich but Gladestone didn’t take a penny. He had his beloved Beatrice. End of story? No. Gladestone continues - “I do not sleep. Ever. Madness has my scent. He is coming for me. I think only one thought. I, too, am damned to the hellfire. My only hope of salvation is a blood redemption at the grave of Edmund Smuts. When the blood of Smuts flows one last time the Angel of Reckoning shall arrive. Only then will I be released from this covenant. I must act. Yet I falter. I cannot do it. I am doomed to burn. Gladestone never returned to the grave And this is where I come in. My ancestor started this story with a nib and a notebook. I’m going to finish it with my first feature film. [aircraft engines] [Brian] Not now man, put it away. [Kurt] Brian! Two minutes man. It’s going to go right over us. [Brian] We’ll do it later. Can we figure out where our ride is first? [Kurt] Yeah. Come at me. Holy shit! Come on. Come on, bring it! [Engines scream] Wow! Damn it, I keep getting his voicemail. [Kurt] C’mon just do one for the website, right. [Brian] We’ll do it later OK? Can I at least get us a ride out of here? My name is Kurt Michaels and this is Minute One, Day One, Hour One Of production of our upcoming indie horror flick Blood Redemption. Three weeks ago I’ve cashed in my college fund and have bought two tickets for myself – hang on - and Brian here To fly to this sunny place Sydney, Australia. To film the next big indie horror flick. It’s going to be a wild ride so strap yourselves in. - [horn beeps] - I’m coming. I gotta roll. Look at this. [Camo] How are ya mate? - [Kurt] Awesome. - [Camo] Yep. [BRIAN] Here we go. Welcome to Australia. [Camo] You guys don’t mind if I have a surf this arvo do ya? [Kurt]No dude, I‘d love to watch actually. Can I try? Aaah… [KURT] Do you mind if I take the car for a spin while you're surfing? You got a license? [Kurt] C’mon. I’m a good driver. A good driver. [Camo] I’m sure you’re a lot of things Kurt but… [Brian] I’m terrified by this left side of the road thing. I’ve freaked out like three times. [Camo] That’s right, You guys drive on the wrong side don’t ya [Brian] The right side. - [Camo] The wrong side. - [Brian] The right side. - [Kurt] Right side of the road. [Kurt] The best surfing beach in the world. No no, I’ve never seen an Aussie surf in Bondi. [Kurt] What! Who surfs there? Tourists mate. Like yourself. [Kurt] But you can surf there right? If you like waves probably not. [Kurt] I heard the dolphins actually surf there with you at Bondi. [mutters] yeah cool. You boys want to shoot a kangaroo while you’re down here? - [Kurt] No. - [Brian] No thanks. Why not? [Kurt] They’re so cute. Are you kidding?

Oh Brian. [laughter] Oh my God. Don’t stop. [laughter] [Camo] You guys planning to shoot a whole bloody film on an iPhone? - [Brian] No. - [Kurt] No this is just Part One of the documentary. [Kurt] People want something bigger. People want transmedia. Transmedia is what the people are hungry for. [Brian] They want to be able to download what they want when they want it. [Kurt] So that’s what we’re going to give them. We’re gonna give them what they want when they want so they can watch the movie and then they can watch us making the movie. Mate, I’m your guy. That’s what I do. I shoot real life, I chop out the boring bits. I’m your man. [Brian] You won’t have to too much chopping with this idiot around. [Camo] yeah why’s that? [Brian] Nothing’s boring with Kurt [laughter] [Camo] Oh man I’ve always loved horror eh, can’t get enough of it. [Brian] Yeah. Like Japanese horror And ghost stories and shit? [Kurt] But what about French horror man? [Camo] French horror? [Kurt] Yeah. That’s where it is now. What’s that? Like chicks with hairy vaginas? [Kurt] No it’s like arthouse gore dude. It’s like they totally see the beauty in death. [creepy music] [Kurt] Gladestone came this way. Following the rumours, the whispers. Looking for his big story. In the end he couldn’t even tell his story. All he was left with was a dark, horrible, unspeakable secret. That he took to the grave. [Camo] So you’re the director? [Brian] No, no, I’m just the producer. [Kurt] I’m the director. [Camo] Yeah right and you wrote the screenplay? [Kurt] Pretty much. It’s based on a story of an ancestor of mine so I just adapted that. [Camo] Yeah wait a minute. The next.. the next Blair Witch is based on a story of something that happened in your family. Pretty much, that’s exactly it, yeah. [Camo] You’re a sick puppy mate. Thank you. [Camo] OK let’s get this doco going. Alright um. Exit the car fellas. Australian soil. Feels good. [Brian] It was just an injury. That’s the only reason I can’t surf okay? Maybe … maybe if I heal or something.. What is was was a dolphin that he thought was a shark. No it wasn’t. [Camo] Boys, boys! [Kurt] ooh! [Brian] Hello… Is this stalking? Technically we’ve got a camera... [Kurt] No, no. It’s not stalking if they want to be followed. Right? [Brian] Erggh.. Want to be followed? [Kurt] Yeah, by the right guys. [Brian] That might be the creep - iest thing you’ve ever said. [Kurt] Go on. Go talk to them. [Brian] You talk to them.

You don’t know that. We haven’t seen her, she hasn’t talked to us, her agent hasn’t.. I’m nervous, man. This is a big gamble. On this one girl. That was a great opportunity. [Kurt] Yeah. [Brian] I know, I know. [Kurt] Shae will do it. [Brian] I trust you, it’ll be fine. Yeh I know but… just let me have a safety net. Can I? - [Kurt] OK - [Brian] OK. But Shae will do it. [Camo] Hey hey boys, sorry to interrupt but who’s Shae? Ah, he doesn’t know, why don’t you tell him? OK, Shae is the stunning female lead female lead to our film Blood Redemption. [Camo] Yeah right. But what, she won’t commit to the role or.. [Brian] Well it’s tough for her to commit when she doesn’t know it exists. [Kurt] Her agent’s blocking us, he doesn’t like the whole indie movie thing… Look at this view. They give it to the dead! Kurt’s had a hard-on for this chick that just won’t quit. - [Kurt] Fuck you. - [Brian] What, man? It’s true. You wrote a screenplay for her. You won’t see anyone else. Woah look at this. - [Kurt] Kurt Michael’s film. - [Brian] I call that obsessed. [Kurt] Died of... doubt and despair after lingering illness. - [Kurt] So sad. - [Brian] If we don’t have an actress we don’t have a film. Shae will do it. [Brian] I hope so Shae will do it. [ creepy music ] [Kurt] This is the Journal. [Camo] The famous Journal. [Camo] Holy shit. [Brian] Show me. Yeah. My favourite’s the next one. Turn the page. - [Camo] What? - [Brian] Look at the next one. [Camo] Dude, this shit is messed up. [Kurt] That’s the genocide man. [Camo] Wait. Where’s this set? [Kurt] Tasmania. [Camo] Yeah right. And you’re going to Tasmania? We’re going to Tasmania. [Kurt] Package deal. I’m not so sure... what this stuff means but it came with the Journal so… - [Camo] You’re a weird guy Kurt. - [Kurt laughs] [Camo] How the hell did you get this through Customs? [Kurt] There’s some ashes in here. I know, right? [Brian] I have my ways. [Camo] There you are mate. You can keep your weird shit to yourself. [Kurt] It’s cool right? [Camo] Mm-hmm. [Brian] Just don’t know what any of it’s used for. [Kurt] Yep. [Brian] How does it help? [Kurt] This looks like a tongue scraper to me. [calm music] [Camo] Did your parents tell you about this Gladestone guy? Kurt’s an orphan. [Camo] Shit! Sorry mate I didn’t mean to.. No, no, don’t.. don’t flip out man, it’s cool. It’s part of life’s rich tapestry you know. [Camo] Sorry. [Brian] Besides, my family’s basically adopted him by now anyway. [Camo] So you fellas are like brothers then? He’s basically Dad’s favourite kid. [Kurt] I reckon it’s more your mom that fancies me. Hey! Can we leave the mothers out of this? [Camo] You reckon I could meet you mum mate? No. We’re here on business. Alright? Business. [Kurt] Down here? [Brian] This one? [Camo] Yeah. [Kurt] Here? [Camo] Yeah. Just lift the latch. [Kurt] Really? Is there a light? [Camo] Oh yeah.

[Camo] There’s room to sleep upstairs this will have to be the office. [Brian coughs violently] - [Kurt] Alright. - [Brian] Oh God [Camo] Be careful mate, we found a dead rat in there the other day. - [Kurt] I’m really serious. - [Camo] We get next doors Wifi Are there spiders in here? [Camo] No. You sure? [Camo] No. Next question – where’s your mom? [Camo] Sorry but who’s Shae? [Kurt] In the middle there. Under the blood. The blonde. [Brian] So… there’s no bookings. [Kurt] whaddya mean, what does that mean? It’s just first come, first serve. Go get some tickets. Doors aren’t even open man, it’s alright. [Brian] Chill man. It’ll be OK. - [Brian] Just chill. - [Kurt] Don’t tell me to chill Brian, alright? I’m chilled. Ok? [Brian] Let’s get some beer. Yeah. Grab me a Fosters? Camo [in a girls voice]: “Don’t worry Kurt I’ll do your little film. And then I’ll do you”. When shall we three meet again? In thunder, lightning or in rain? When the Hurly-burly’s done, when the battle’s lost and won. Where be the place? Upon the heath. There to meet with… [All] Macbeth! [cheesy thunder effect] [crowd cheers raucously] All hail Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter. [3rd Witch] Good Sir, why do you start in fear for that which sounds so fair. Speak! No stay… fuck! Fuck! Stay [Crowd laughs] - A little later. - [Crowd laughter] [Crowd laughter] They must lie there. Go carry them and smear the sleepy grooms with blood. I’ll go no more… I’m… [Crowd laughter] [indistinct conversation] [knocking] [Katie] Sorry, this is a changeroom. - [Kurt] Shae.. - [Shae] (uncertainly) Hi. - [Kurt] Hi! - [Katie] You can’t be in here, we just done a show. [Kurt] I’m Kurt, Kurt Michaels. Um, we met at Aaron Levy’s party in LA. [Shae] Aaaah… - [Kurt] Aaron Levy. - [Shae] Aaron Levy’s! Of course! So what are you guys .. out from L.A.? [Kurt] Yes. We just… We just came in. Actually. -[Shae] Awesome. - [Kurt] From L.A. - [Shae] Cool. [Kurt] And I’m.. I’m.. Well I’m ready to do our film. [Shae] Sorry? [Kurt] Um. OK so you remember at the party how I told you that I was adapting an old family story to a script. Well I finished the script and.. And we’ve tried to contact your agent a bunch of times [Katie] Um babe. I’m gonna go get a drink - and say hello to a few people so.. [Kurt] .. we haven’t heard back.. [Shae] I’ll see you in the foyer. [Kurt] But it’s such a good project and I think you would just... well I think it would be great for you. [Shae] Have you got any other actors or anything? [Kurt] Oh you’d be starring opposite me. [Shae] really? You’re an actor? [Kurt] Yeah remember? Actor slash director slash writer. [Shae] Right... That’s a lot of slashes. Look guys, I am so flattered but I’m going to save you some time. I’ve done this kind of stuff before and .. [Kurt] Just, just get coffee with me. Right now. We’ll go grab a coffee and [Shae] I’m actually running late to meet a friend [Kurt] I’ll go through it with you [Shae] Aaa… Sorry… but I.. yeah. [Kurt] Tomorrow! Let’s do coffee tomorrow. - [Shae] Umm. - [Kurt] Or a drink? I’ll buy you a glass of wine and, and look, honestly, it’s not just for me, it’s for you. [Shae] Kurt, I’m actually very flat out at the moment, my... - [Kurt] Five minutes! - [Shae] I, I really I really appreciate it. [Kurt] Alright four I’ll settle for but three is out of the question. [Shae] Yeah. I.. I’m sorry... I can’t really. Thank you though. Can we.. maybe call a cut? [Camo] Don’t worry about it bro. You’ll get your film made. She couldn’t even remember my name man. [CAMO chuckles] She forgot it twice. [creepy atmospheric music] [ blowing wind rustles the leaves] [KURT mutters to himself inaudibly] [ambulance sirens in the distance] [BRIAN chatters about business on phone] [Camo] I reckon you’ve dodged a bullet here. You know what I mean. I mean think about it. Think about how many actors there are in the wings. I mean.. who are dying to be in a film like this. [ creepy music finishes ] [Kurt] I gotta story to tell you. [Camo] Awesome. [Kurt] Human ivory. [Camo] What? [Kurt] Yeah, in the 1820’s there was an illegal trade in human relics like carved skulls and... Careful... and aah, scrimshaw bones and that kind of thing. [Camo] Yeah, cool mate, but I don’t think that kind of shit really happened here, you know what I mean. Here. Gladestone knew that, right? OK but, but.. then he discovered something really weird. He traced the human cargo back to this European living in the backwoods of Tasmania. Edmund Smuts. [Camo] Ah right – the freak. Yes, freak.. but it’s not what you think alright, he’s not some mountain psycho walking around in, in human skin panties full of his own crap you know, he, he.. he was a mayor of a local mining town. He owned everything. And this human flesh trade was just a sideline hobby of his. [Camo] Seriously fucked up mate. [Kurt] Right? [Kurt] So... Edmund ruled with this bloodthirsty terror. Right. He would've had corpses hanging from these trees. He just slaughtered people. [Camo] That’s seriously fucked up but it’s still not a movie. [Brian] What’s not a movie? [Kurt] The Journal. So... Did you tell him about the Curse though? [Camo] Wait a minute.. There’s a curse? - [Kurt] Fucking.. - [Brian] Ow! [Kurt] Spoiler alert man. C'mon! Nice one! [Brian] You didn’t tell him? That’s the best part! [Kurt] No. Alright. Here, gimme that… [Kurt] Human bone. [Camo] One of Edmund’s victims. No this is Edmund. The uh, the locals as revenge put a curse on him. To say that when he was buried a demon would be summoned. [Camo] A demon. - [Kurt] Yeah. - [Camo] Yeah, good one. And Gladestone believed that? Aah, well all I know is that somehow he thought that this would save him from his own fate. [Brian] It all had to be buried together. [Camo] He thought that this box of shit would save his own arse. [Brian] Oh yeah. You better believe it. [Kurt] That’s right. Blood Redemption... One man’s attempt to atone for the sins of the past. [Camo] OK, I take it all back. You guys have a film. But.. don’t you think it’s a bit deep for horror? [Brian] Oh it’s alright. We’ll dumb it down. [Kurt] Speak for yourself. [Morning bird calls, distant traffic] [Brian] so what’s so good about this guy? [Kurt] Lots of th.. He’s got a really good eye. Some of his stuff like.. Freaked me out. [Camo] What’s he made, movies or something? Yeah, yeah, he’s done everything. But he was an old war photographer so.. He knows his stuff. - [Camo] Cool. [Brian] Does he have his own kit? - [Kurt] Yeah. - [Brian] OK. [Grant] Just a sec mate. [poker machine spins] [Kurt] Uh, so.. So Grant, I’ve seen all your work, um.. those pictures you took in the war were.. The guy in Mistrata, with the eyes full of despair I mean.. We’re shooting a horror so it’s all about suspense and fear. Got any kit? [Kurt] Nada. Budget for an assistant? [Brian] Um… [Grant] What about him? [Kurt] That’s.. no he’s filming the doco so.. [Brian] He’ll have his hands full. [Grant] In that case it’ll be you two then. I’ll need extra batteries.. You can fix me up for those. [Kurt] So, so .. shall we go and look at the script? Nah, not interested mate. I know that shot you’re in love with. - That fella in Misrata right? - [Kurt] Yeah. He died while I was filming that, you know. [quiet bar noises] [Kurt] C’mon Shae, just look, read the script. It’s that simple. Why not? [Shae] Seriously Kurt, there are like a thousand other girls that would jump to a film [Kurt] No I don’t want anyone.. I wrote it for you Shae. OK, you wanna be big right? You want what I want. You want success. [Shae] Of course. Who doesn’t? [Kurt] Yes exactly, everybody. Everybody wants success. But you can’t just, just knock on the door and wait for it to open, you gotta bash it down. [Shae] I get it Kurt, I was in L.A. for 2 years. I’ve did it there, a cattle call every other day. [Kurt] Fuck L.A. You don’t need L.A. [Shae] I got 2 ads and a walkon in a pilot the whole time. [Kurt] You’re, you’re something special, you just need to take a chance! It’s different for you Kurt. You can knock until it opens but I’ve got a clock on me and I can’t ignore it so.. [Kurt] Wait, so you just think your looks are just going to fade out before you get your big break, is that..? [Shae] Yeah. I booked a ticket. I’m going back to L.A. If I can’t make it in a year then that’s that. -[Kurt] What?! No! -[Shae] I just really not.. [Kurt] You repeat offender. [Shae] I’m really not in the same place. I’m sorry Kurt [Kurt] Look Shae, every morning, every morning I wake up and I feel like a fucking genius, like an inevitable force and… in here I, I... [SHAE laughs] Great. No, no it’s not some hippy affirmation bullshit, OK, this is the real deal and I want you to feel that way as well. I really do. Ok, what about that, that, that experience that your audience is craving huh? Is, is starving for? To, to, to kill your enemies and fuck your lovers and agonize in your heartache huh? How are you going to deny them? [Shae] You don’t understand at all. [Kurt] Shae, I think you can give that to them. I do. Alright. But you’re going to run away and hide in L.A. C’mon! [Shae] I wish that I could live in that world that you just described. It doesn’t happen like that. OK. I’m sorry. It's back to work for me... [Kurt] C’mon Shae I’m serious. Please. [Shae] Don’t come back again. OK, you have my answer, no means no. [Kurt] I.. [Kurt] Aaah… c’mon, let's go. [ Loud traffic noises] [Brian] All right. I love our job. I really do. - [Kurt] OK. - [Brian] OK. Number one! No. - [Brian] Right away? - [Kurt] Nope. [Brian] OK [Kurt] She looks like Nicolas Cage. [Brian] Yeah. No, no, alright, I gotcha. “Cagey”.

One eyebrow. - [Brian] OK. - [Kurt] Next. [Brian] You’re annoyed with Mifanwy No, I dated a Mifanwy, remember, no! Why did you ever do that? [hamming] That’s re-treading emotional territory. Oh calm down. [Kurt] [moans] Nope. Little older than you. Uh-uh. She’s nice. [ indistinct female chatter] Yeah. He’s a great guy. We did a film together.

Right? I, I don’t want to rush you but.. I mean how long? [ awkward laugh] I’m so sorry, I want to... [“Dane”] Are you scared or something, are you still on your v-plates, I mean.. [Katie and Shae chortle] No. [“Dane”] Is it to do with your dream? [“Chloe”] I can’t... I can’t talk about this, it has to stay inside my dreams. What has to stay inside your dreams? Just drop it please, if you care for me Dane. - [“Dane”] Look if you just tell - [“Chloe”] You can’t help me. You said my eyes were open… - [“Chloe”] before… - [“Dane”] Yeah.. I was awake. [soft creepy music] [“Dane”] No but… [“Chloe”] He visits me every night. Dane. I’m in that twilight moment just about to sleep and I feel him on me. I feel him breathing. I feel him in me. His smell. [music intensifies] [“Chloe”] He touches me Dane. He holds me down with his bodyweight his fingers, they … [“Dane”] There, there are .. Reasons you know, anxiety maybe some repressed memory. I try to struggle, I want to but my arms, they are like they are too heavy to move. It’s like I’m paralysed. I can’t… I can’t put my legs back together. But he doesn’t finish it off. He wants to delay his pleasure. [“Dane”] No Chloe come here. To enjoy the waiting. [“Dane”] You’re safe with me. Alright. I promise. I’m sorry. - I can’t keep going like this. - No, no. We’re in this together. Alright. I’m going to see you through this. I see his face. Good. Alright. That’s a start maybe. He looks like you. - [Kurt] Then we embrace… - [Katie] Make out! [Shae] Cool.

[Lauren] You can’t help me. [Brian] Trust me. [Lauren] I’m in that twilight moment and I’m just about to go to sleep and … and I can feel him … on me. [Brian] Took her three hours to get in the room.

No. No, I'm not going to apologize. What do you mean you’re not going to apologize At least be nice. Just be nice. [Kurt] Some weird number has been ringing me all day. I might do a VLOG. You know the expression “this film is the sum of all my compromises” [car door] well, I don’t know who said that but I feel like they knew me really well. [ car driving off ] But then again… [Shae] Kurt. Where the hell is your office? [Kurt] What are you doing here? [Shae] Umm.. I read your script. [Kurt] You liked it? [Shae] Aaah..

Thank you. [Kurt] Sorry. You just… you have no idea.. Aaagh [Shae giggles] [Kurt] You have no idea. [Shae] OK. Awesome. [Kurt] OK? Shae. Would you like to step into my office? [Shae] I would. [Kurt] Brian’s going to shit himself. [Kurt mouths silently] [silence] [Haunting ghostly music] [old motor boat hugging steadily] [morning bird calls] [music swells] [clunks of boat docking] [rope pull] [Brian] Sorry. Just in.. [Kurt] Sorry, do you want us to put it up here or down there? [ Loud, rumbling didgeridoo music ] [ birds calling in the bush] [ insects chatter] [inaudible comments by Kurt ] [Bronwyn] Nobody told me about filmin’ on the boat. [driving music continues on] [swamp creatures pass by ] [Shae] I’ll read a little bit, anyway. [Kurt] Right. [Shae] Alright. Ready? [Katie] Yes. [Shae] July 29th. “She had a distaste for the work. This man had..” This writing is so bad. Aaah.. something. [Katie] So Edmund came down this river? - [Kurt] No. - [Shae laughs] [Shae] Gladestone. - [Katie] What? - [Shae] OK This is Gladestone. He’s the good guy. This is Edmund. [Katie] Oh c’mon, they look the same! [Shae] No they don’t! And you’re related to Edmund? [Kurt] No I’m related, I’m related to Gladestone, the good guy. [Shae] OK. - This is Beatrice. - [whistles] She was… Gladestone’s beau but Edmund’s fiancée. [Kurt] Yeah but she was married to Gladestone. [Shae] No. That was after Gladestone pulled a total Mr Darcy on her. OK. Wait. Who’s Mr Darcy? [laughs] [Brian] It’s just someone else. OK so Beatrice … Beatrice is like this aristocratic debutante – listen - [Kurt] Sorry. [Shae] then her father married her off to this.. - [Katie] guy.. - [Shae] rich guy in Tassie. But, but … by the time she got here he’d died of pox so she was just left. [Kurt] Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So Edmund wanted to buy all of this guy’s land, that she was going to marry, and then he wanted her in the deal as well. [Brian] Buying a wife and a house. - [Kurt] Yeah. - [Katie] So he just bought her? - [Brian] Yeah. He tried to. - [Shae] Pretty much. How do you know so much? Because I’ve read the book. It’s called a Journal. [haunting ghostly music] [Kurt] She’s smart… sexy… insightful… brave… Incredibly courageous. - She's athletic. - [Shae] OK she’s just very perfect. [Kurt] She’s blond. - [Shae] Yeah? - [Kurt] Well she’s like the the Madonna of the piece you know. - [Shae] Yeah… yeah, yeah. - [Kurt] She’s the saviour. - [Kurt] The guardian angel. - [Shae] It’s a bit boring. How about I look for some problems to give her? Some kind of, I don’t know, something. - Something. - [Kurt] Yeah. Something.. kind of .. challenge. [Kurt] well look, we’ll look at the script together later I gotta check on.. [Shae] don’t run away. I’m talking to you about this later. [Kurt] Yes we will I promise. Later. [shrill bird calls] [Ghostly music] [Bronwyn] You Yanks. Don’t know shit about the world. Do ya? Do you know why there’s no blackfellas in Tassie? [Brian] Actually yeah. We do. [Bronwyn] They clean killed every last fucken one of them. Strung ‘em up from the trees. [Kurt] Yeah well we know that. [Bronwyn] You related to Gladestone Michaels eh? [Kurt] What do you know about him? [Bronwyn] I know enough to stay the fuck away from where you’re going. [Brian] Why.. why.. What does that mean? What you..? You know your fella killed the worst bastard that ever lived on this island? - Stole his woman? - [Kurt] Yeah. Be a smart fella. We can drop you here. You don’t have to go anywhere near there. [Kurt] No, no it has to be authentic. [ Boat engine stopped. Waves lapping ] [Inaudible chatter] [Bronwyn] Tide says we won’t get back in till sparrow’s fart Monday. [Grant] So still be dark then? [Bronwyn] We’ll set two flares. Don’t miss ‘em. We’re not coming back for you. You can swim out. [Katie] Can you pull it in a bit more? Ooh ooh I’m going to cry.. - [Brian] There you go. - [Shae] Yay! Chuck the rest of the bags over. - [Kurt] Yep. [Brian] And easy.. You got the rope? - [Shae] Woah woah.. - [Katie] Oh no. [Grant] I just had a heart attack. [Brian] Oh man don’t worry about it. [Ominous music] [Kurt] Grant, it’s up this way. Oh Grant! Grant. Can you um get a shot of the boat leaving? [Grant] Way ahead of you. [Boat chugging] [ominous music continues] [music fades out] [crows caw] [heavy breathing] [stumbling footsteps] [Camo] Fuck! [Grant] Whoah. Careful Camo. [Camo] Cheers mate.

[Kurt] If um, if Camo and Brian go up a little further and get out of the shot and you could go from behind and shoot the three of us walking up for a while? [Grant] Sure. Everyone take a break, take about 15 to set up. [Brian] We don’t really have 15 actually. We’re .. [Kurt] It’s just 15 minutes. [Brian] we’re on a tight schedule dude. [Kurt] No. I think we should do it. [Brian] We got a lot of ground to cover, look at this hill. [Camo] Well um, what if I do it, I’ m all set up, I can just drop back. - [Brian] Aaah.. - [Kurt] Oh yeah. - [Brian] I don’t know.. - [Kurt] For the film..? If we get split up.. Yeah. We could do it on that camera for a bit. If you get lost or something happens He’s looking at us through the lens, how’s he going to get lost? I don’t know, I’m just saying. [Camo] Mate, she’ll be sweet. I’ll be careful. He’ll be careful. He’ll be careful, come on. [bird calls] [Camo’s footsteps crackle on the undergrowth ] [Camo] Oh shit. Can’t believe this.

[ everyone laughs] [Brian] I don’t know. I just think this is a box of nothing. Just a bunch of old junk that he had. I’m not sure if there’s a curse in there. I think it’s just Beatrice’s stuff. [ campfire crackles] [ dry swishes] [ crackly undergrowth] Ugh! [ scrapes of bone dry branches] [Kurt] Oh wow! Oh my god. [laughs] Oh my god! Oh you guys look at this. Brian?

Steady. I’m not… It’s not authentic. Alright we’re not picking it up on the camera that you’re actually … We need to see what Grace is seeing alright? So.. so… what’s going on? I’m at the edge of a cliff. Are you scared? - Yeah! - Well USE that. Use the fear alright. Use that real fear. Um… - So… - [Brian] Kurt – safety please. [Camo] Eh Kurt mate… Come on.

[screams] [Kurt] Grace SCREAM! Really scream! [Katie] Stoooop [screams her head off] Oooooh [angry]. That’s SO much better OK? That’s what I’m talking about. [Brian] What the fuck are you doing man? [Kurt] Grant? What the hell? Did we not get that? Course we didn’t get that. There’s no way in hell - we could use that. - [Kurt] Are you serious? [Brian] If her agent saw that we are both fucked. Alright Katie. Katie … Another one? [Camo] Kurt, no. [Kurt] One more. C’mon. [Katie] No fucking way. [Shae] Come on. Fuck. - There’s no way we could use - We gotta move on anyway - could use any of that. - C’mon guys. C’mon. [Kurt] Yeah, look I’m sorry. I should have asked. I should have asked. I just, I want it to be the best performance it could be, you want that right? Well yeah! You should have asked me first. [Kurt] Yeah I know! I should have asked but I just didn’t want to fuck up your focus. OK maybe if we just set up some ground rules then maybe in the future we’ll be fine. [Kurt] I knew.. I knew you would say that. You’re meant to trust your director. [Katie] You have to earn our trust. [Shae] Exactly. Try to get along. [Katie] Try being a little more positive with your notes. - [Kurt] We’re making an awesome… - [Brian] Yes. [Kurt] What the fuck is the point of being here? [Brian] Totally. It has to be awesome. [Kurt] Yes OK. So you agree with me. [Brian] Yes I agree, Can we GO!? [ gentle music] [massive water whooshing] [ dry crackling footsteps] [ cockatoos screeching] [Brian] Oh… Fuck! [ gusty wind blows] [Kurt] Let’s roll man. [Brian] Shut up Kurt. [Kurt] We’re on a tight schedule remember. - C’mon man, - [Brian] Kurt, Kurt, Kurt. [Kurt let’s do it. [Brian] Kurt I don’t know how I’m going to do this. As you said man we’re on a schedule, we gotta roll so.. Could you just give me hand please? Where were you when I needed you man? You didn’t have my back. You.. you were being a dick. [Kurt] Just keep feeling the wall with that hand and edge along. You’re fine and I got you. Just keep feeling along like a crab. [ warm uplifting music] [Kurt] Like a crab. [Brian] Like that? Like.. [Kurt] Be the crab. [Kurt] Perfect. You’re doing really well. - [Brian] OK. - [Kurt] Really well. [ music swells with powerful didgeridoo] [ many gushing streams of water] [ faint unintelligible haunting indigenous chant ] [ uplifting music continues] [Grant] ( in distance) Hang on. Guys, the sound sucks! [ on headphones: Same haunting chant] Listen to this man. [ chant echoes surreally off cliff walls ] [ hissing waterfall ] [Shae] We have to film it here? In this place really? It’s freaking me out. [Kurt] Yeah well OK there’s something… here. We’re going to capture it in the camera and it’s going to be… exceptional. [Shae] You’re not helping me Kurt. [Kurt] Gladestone knew it. [Shae] I wonder what Gladestone knew. [Kurt] What do you mean? [Shae] I mean he only ever gave us half the story, what is he hiding? Nothing. He killed a guy. He had to be careful. [Shae] He was obsessed with that curse. He was scared to death. [Kurt] He wasn’t, wasn’t scared. [Shae] He never let it go. He thought that the ghost of Edmund had it in for him. You are Gladestone’s descendant. You should think about that. OK. [fire crackles] [crickets] [owl hoots] [ footsteps] Here we are. In the Styx valley. What a place. I… I can’t shake this feeling like I have been here before. It’s so weird, it’s like.. It’s like a psychic echo handed down from my relative. You know Gladestone went right through here on his way to Edmund. He had his Journal, I have my film. I guess we’re linked in that way. Except.. He never fulfilled his mission to reveal the horrors of Edmund to the world. Just think, when this film comes out that dream will be fulfilled. Nearly 200 years later I’m going to finish what he started. [ fire crackles] [ footsteps] [ flames roar] - It needs a love scene! - I know! I know. I agree. It does. But a sex scene however … No, it’s not a sex scene OK It’s completely tasteful. It will be filmed tastefully. Yeah. There’s usually a way to do this you know. You go.. you talk to my agent, - you sign a contract.. - Yeah. [Shae] you can’t just chuck it in when we’re about to do it. [Kurt] OK. Uh-huh. Yep. [Shae] I mean what nudity is it? How much? How’s it shot? I’m not hiding anything, it’s in the script. It’s not about the nudity. The nudity is just… [Shae] It’s a part of it. For me.. It’s a part of it.. [Shae] Yeah? Can that go? [rip] Were you even going to ask me? [Kurt] Yes of course. [Shae] When? OK. Well it’s fine then. - [Shae] OK. Bye. - [Kurt] I’m making changes. [Kurt] I’m making changes. [Shae] Good. - [Camo] Sound. - [Brian] Rolling. - [Camo] You right Kurt? - [Kurt] Yup. [Camo] Alright. 36A Take 3. [Grant] Mark it. [clap] -[Camo] Camera set. -[Grant] Camera set. [Camo] Action. You awake? I am now. I can’t sleep. You must have a guilty conscience. I have sinned. Confess sinner. My thoughts.. Have been impure. That sounds serious. Have you given over to these impure thoughts? Not yet. But um… I fear I might. It doesn’t look like you’re trying very hard. I’m … fighting with every fiber of my soul. [”] I’m not… ready. What’re you waiting for? You have no idea of boundaries K.. Kurt. [Kurt] (as Kurt) Oh.. Sorry. Dane. Let’s go again. I lost focus. No. I was going to cut anyway. What’s going on? What? You have some notes? Yeah I do. This scene is all about Chloe’s powerful attraction to Dane and the fact that she wants to give over her body to him as well as.. - [Shae] Kurt, you knew that.. - [Kurt] .. her soul. You knew that I saw her as still deciding at this point. OK, shes, shes deciding whether Dane is dependable. And safe. Why are both of you fighting me at every step of the way huh? You’re not seeing the bigger picture at all, OK, it’s .. You’re holding back and your priorities are all… [Exasperated snort] Roll again. Can I just have a moment? Roll again. You awake? I am now. Can’t sleep. [ distant thunder] You must have a guilty conscience. I have sinned. Confess sinner. My thoughts have been impure. Well that sounds serious. Have you given over to these impure thoughts? Not yet. But I fear I might. Doesn’t look like you’re trying very hard. I’m fighting with every fiber of my soul. Not ready. Relax You have no ideas of boundaries Dane. No. I don’t. Out here we make our own rules. [heavy thunder] [ horrific human-like howling] [Camo] What was that! [ frantic howling continues] [Camo] Oh shit! [ Camo pants in terror] [Camo] Grant! Get up! [ torch switch] [Grant] Oh shit Camo! [Camo] Grant, get up. [Grant] What - [Camo] There’s something out there. [Grant] What the fuck? [Camo] Something weird out here man. [Katie] Camo!

[insects buzzing] [Brian] Kurt where the hell are we going? [Shae] He said he saw this place in his… dream. [Brian] Dream? Do you have a map? I knew this log would be here. It’s like being on a conveyor belt. [ loud frog and insect noises] C’mon. Guys! Nearly there. Wooooh! Look at this! I told you look at this. I told you. This is it. I told you this is exactly it.

That’s Edmunds fucking mark and she’s not going to die for your movie. [Kurt] She’s going to finish the fucking film. [Brian] It’s a movie. [Katie] FUCK your movie! NO!

[Brian] OK.OK. [Shae] She doesn’t have a map or anything. [Camo] What about the creek? [Brian] Shae – go with Grant. Maybe you can find her around the falls. [Camo] You didn’t go all the way to the creek? What about … [Brian] And shout if you see anything. Kurt, come with me. We’ll go down here. [Camo] Am I.. Am I coming with you? [Brian] No, no Camo, stay here. Ah, holler if you hear anything alright man. She might come back to camp. [Camo] Yep. Right. Righto. OK. [Brian] Kurt, come on. [Camo] Oh, what’s that!

[Camo] Katie, I can’t understand what youre.. [water trickles heavily] [unseen creek gurgles loudly] [water splashes] [ Camo’s breathing trembles fearfully] [ eerie wind whistles] There’s not fucking way I’m going in there. [loud splash of Camo’s footsteps in river] [ghostly sigh echoes] [large waterdrops plop into stream] [ Katie’s distant wails echo through the cavern ] (whispers) Hold it together. Hold it together.

[ Shrill Devil howl gets closer] [crackling twigs in the tree canopy] Katie? Aaaargh! [Camo screams in agony] [ thrashing branches] [ choking sounds] [ creaking vines under strain] [ thud of head landing ] [ electrical zap] [silence] It… I was.. I was so stressed about finding an ending to my film. I was obsessed with finding a twist. People are always talking about the endings of films you know “Oh I didn’t see that coming” But the reason they like it is because… it’s so like life… You know. You never do. [ weird electronic static] [Brian] Oh, it was recording. [Grant] Hang on. - [Brian] Holy shit! - [Shae] What is that? [Sahe] See what that is. That’s the fucking mark. Oh my god, can we please leave? Can we please get back to camp now? [ rustling through undergrowth] [Shae inhales sharply] [screams] Katie.. Katie was calling his name. What’s happened to her? [sobs] [exhales] [ominous music] [Shae] The church at Tullochgorum. [Kurt] Edmund’s grave. Uh-huh. He isn’t going to just let us do this you know. [Kurt] What else are we going to do? He isn’t… going to just let us go home. [Kurt] You know with you there’s always been two films. - [Brian] Oh yeah? - [Kurt] Yeah. The one I want to make and the one I have to make with you. - [Brian] With me? - [Kurt] Yeah. [Brian] Gimme the camera. I know why you like this thing so much. Because when shit isn’t going your way, when you’re having a bad day, And you’re just out of luck you just look through your magic fucking camera And then ‘Hey!’ you come out on top. Oh, now you get the last word, now you get the girl. Now you… you’re the fucking film artist, the fucking primo artiste right? Yeah exactly. The artist. That’s what burns you the most isn’t it. Isn’t it huh? I don’t fucking care. Film’s over. We’re going home tomorrow. [Kurt] Maybe for you. I’m getting my ending. We can’t go until we deal with this. [Brian] You’re kidding right? She’s kidding. Are you serious? Do you see what is happening? [Brian] you actually believe in this fucking curse bullshit? It’s all shit. That’s it, show’s over, no more film. This is not the film where we all die. Thank you but no. - We’re leaving in the morning. - [Shae] Look around you Brian. [Kurt] C’mon Brian. You’re writing the script now. You’ve got the next line. [Brian] Shut up Kurt. [exhales] [Kurt] Which one? Which one Brian? [Brian] Get the fuck out of my way. [Shae] What’s the time? [Kurt] I don’t know. [ Katie calls eerily in the distance] [Shae] Katie… [ Katie moans] [Shae] What was that? Did you hear that? [ Katie calls] KATIE! KATIE! [ hundreds of frogs croak loudly in response ] [ Katie moans] Sounds like she is moving away KATIE… [Kurt] It’s not her. What? How do you know that? KATIE! [Shae] I have to know. [Kurt] Katie! [Brian] Katie! [Shae screams in terror] [confused yells] [Shae sobs loudly] [Shae] That’s Katie’s jacket. [ weird destructive noises in distance ] [Brian] Sssh. [Kurt] Keep going. Let’s go. [Grunts and panting] [tree trunks being struck violently in distance] [timber breaking in distance] [trees being felled] [Brian] Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s go. Oh shit go! Go1 [Tree branches swish and break] [ loud yelling and screaming] [Brian] Kurt! Gimme your hand! Gimme your hand! [loud explosion] Let's go, let's go. [Brian] Get up. [Kurt] Get the camera! The camera! Brian get it quick! [Brian] Use the light! Are you cut? - [Kurt] No! - [Brian] Are you cut? [Kurt] I’m cool, I’m cool, just give me the camera. Please! [Brian] Fuck! [Grant] it’s done. Let’s go. Go! Go! [Kurt] Where’s Shae? [Brian] Stop, stop, stop. Stay away from the trees. Shae? Shae? Where’d she go? Which way did she go? Fuck! Shhh. [Kurt] SHAE! [ They all yell for Shae] [ Shae screams in the distance] - [Brian] Let’s go. - [Kurt] Go. [ Shae’s screaming continues] [Brian] Oh my god. [Kurt] Shae! Wait there! [ Violent creaking and cracking of branches] [ Shae squeals and whimpers] [Kurt] Shae! [ knocking sounds in distance continue] [ wind blows gently] [Shae] You stopped it. [Kurt] Gotta go. C’mon. We should go. [ Scrambling on stony ground ] [Brian] That tree… [Shae] What… [Brian] Yeah… [Shae] What happened…? [ frustrated sigh] [Shae] I have no idea. Let’s just go this way. [ trudging footsteps] [Shae] Kurt. Just stop… stop… filming. [Kurt] I’m giving you what I promised you. [Shae] There isn’t a promise anymore. There’s no movie anymore. [Kurt] You want to be a star. You want to be someone. I am someone. I am someone! I’m Shae! [ angry exclamations] Put it down please! Put the camera DOWN! Please stop that. [trudging footsteps] [insects] [Brian] Is that a church? [ spooky music] [Shae] That’s it. [Kurt] Lets go. [Shae] Oh, shouldn’t we.. [Grant] We go. We bury the shit. We leave. [Shae] OK. [Brian] Whatever you say Indiana Jones, let’s do this. [ music swells] [ Shae sharply inhales ] [ loud penetrating digeridoo music] [Shae] Guys …? Who’s that? What is it? [Kurt] Look [Shae] Oh God… Look at them all… What do they want.. [Grant] They're his victims. Here’s your horror movie Kurt. [ music continues] [music fades] [Kurt] Yeah. He’s here now. He’s … I can feel him, he's … wants his Beatrice you know and he was going to walk down this aisle with her and… and … and he thought they were going to be together forever. [Shae] Maybe there’ll be some… records., Edmund’s grave or something. [ creaky footsteps] [Brian] He’s not in there. They don’t have anything. What’ll we do? [Kurt] Let’s find the grave. [eerie wind ] [footsteps in dry grass] [Shae] What are we going to do? We can’t just keep looking [Kurt] What else are we gonna do!? We have to… [Shae inhales sharply] [nervous panting] [Shae] Fuck! Guys… [Kurt] Got it? [Shae] Oh shit… [Kurt] Oh! [Brian] Oh wow. That’ll do. [Grant] Edmund Jan Smuts. [Kurt] Let’s get it open. [ stones clatter ] [Shae] Get the box! [Kurt] I got it. [Shae] Quick. [Brian] Do I get ‘em out? - [Kurt] Yeah get them out. - [Shae] Put the whole box in. [Brian] The whole thing? [ enormous cracking timber] [Shae] What the fuck? [Brian] Just dig! Let’s get these bits. [Kurt] Chuck it in Brian. [Brian] Do we aaah.. Say a prayer? - [Kurt] Just bury it Brian! - [Brian] OK, OK. [Kurt] Now! [ stones clunk] [Brian] OK. [Shae laughs relieved] [Brian] It’s done! That’s it. [Grant] Burn in hell, ya fucker. [ massive swish and thud ] [Brian] Shit! Grant! [Intense screaming and yelling] [ Massive earthquake rumbling ] [ screaming continues] [Brian] didn’t fucking work. It didn’t fucking work! [Shae] We must have done something wrong, I don’t understand. [Brian] No. We did everything right! We buried the fucking box. This curse is bullshit! [Kurt] No it’s not. Course it’s not! Gladestone knew what he was doing… Shut the fuck up about Gladestone, Kurt. You just stood there and watched Grant die like a fucking psycho. - [Kurt] Fuck you Brian you dont.. - [Brian] What! [Kurt] Wait. Wait. Gimme.. Oh Shit. [Shae] What? What? [Brian] Let go. [Shae] What? What? [screams] [Shae] Noooooo. [Kurt] Shae. No Shae don’t worry that. That’s too small, that’s not it. It is, it is… Ooooh my god Fuck off… [screams hysterically] [Kurt] Come here. Come here. Shae. Come here. Get the fucking box. Get the fucking box! [Brian] What? [Shae] Get the box! What the fuck? [Sharp inhale] [Shae] Kurt. Why are you the only one not cut? [Kurt] I don’t know. Gladestone maybe? He’s protecting me? [Brian] Shut up about Gladestone Kurt. [The ring around Kurt’s neck chimes] [Shae] Did you get this ring from the box? [Kurt] Yeah. It was Gladestone’s. So what? [Shae] OK help me. [Brian] What are you looking for? - [Shae] Give me your ring. - [Kurt] What? [Shae] Give me your ring. Now! Oh. Fuck. [Brian] They’re the same. [Shae] That.. That isn’t Gladestone’s ring. It’s Beatrice’s. She was married to Edmund. [Kurt] No… - [Shae] Yes! - [Kurt] No way! What do you mean it’s all about me? [Shae] You got it wrong OK? You thought you were the last descendant of Gladestone. - [Kurt] Yeah, I know I am. - [Shae] You’re not. [Kurt] Bullshit! Of course I am. All this stuff, all this stuff is Gladestone’s. [Shae] Yes it’s Gladestone’s but he isn’t the father of Beatrice’s child. What de didn’t want us to find out was that Beatrice was pregnant with Edmund’s child before he stole here away. [Brian] What about all the junk in the box then? What’s that for? He had to convince someone that… he’d killed the child. - [Brian] Killed his own kid?! - [Shae] Edmund’s child. [Kurt] That’s fucking crazy alright. That’s insane. Why would he do that? Edmund was cursed. [Kurt] EDMUND was cursed. “When the blood of Smuts flows for the last time” What do you think that means Kurt? [Kurt] I don’t know! I.. it doesn’t mean anything! [Shae] The blood of his children! His kids. His bloodline. His curse was to watch all his children die before he was dragged to hell. And then Gladestone shows up and takes away his unborn child. [Brian] No way. You’re Edmund’s descendant. The fuck… [Brian] You. You’re supposed to be in the grave. Not his stuff. [Shae] Kurt. You’re the only remaining descendant of Edmund Smuts. [Brian] That’s why you’re not cut. He doesn’t want you here. He wants you out there making as many little Edmunds as possible. [Kurt] It’s not true, alright! I’m his descendant. I’m Gladestone’s … You’re not his descendant Kurt. [Kurt] I’m his son. I’m finishing his story. [Brian] Your ancestor was a killer. [Kurt] No alright. - NO! [Brian] Give me the goddam fucking camera! [Kurt] Brian I’m finishing, I’m doing.. Give it back! [Brian] I carried you forever. I gave you everything! [Kurt] You.. Had everything! You had everything! I had nothing! I had nothing. I just wanted one thing! I wanted one thing. My FUCKING FILM! [Kurt pants heavily] Brian! Brian? Brian? Oh? Ffffuck! No. Hey? Oooh my God! Fuck! [ Kurt sobs] [Kurt] I’m a killer. I’M A KILLER, I’m Edmund! Fuck! [ Shae shrieks and sobs] [Kurt] God, a fucking killer. [Kurt sobs uncontrollably] [ heavy wind blows] [Shae] You’re not Edmund Kurt. Edmund wants us to go. Let’s go. [Kurt] He wins. [Shae] Let him rot in purgatory forever. Let’s go please. [Kurt] What about justice for his victims huh? These wandering souls… You’re going to be my guardian. OK. Take the film. [Shae] Ok. Rolling. Go. [Kurt] When I was young, a long time ago I… I grabbed hold of the tail of a tiger and I never let go. It spun around and around and it went this way And that way and it came after me and I grabbed hold even tighter. And it was hungry but I wouldn’t let go. [eerie music] But today I’m going to let go of that tail. Today she gets to eat me. [ music intensifies] [erupting fireballs] [Kurt groans in intense pain] [fires burn furiously] [ swish of wings] The horror. The horror.
