Once he's cold, bury him. Jesus! My beloved Daddy! - Oh, Christ! - Zbroya... - Give me back... - Madam... - Give me back my daddy! - Madam Zbroya! What? How dare you... speak to me like that! How dare you... even... look... at me! How dare you! Amen! MAGNESIUM We live off the border. We can't ignore what it requires of us. Father was a good leader. But old age made him blind to change. Can you count? Then multiply what we have by ten. Drugs? On the Soviet side, it's the hottest seller. We weren't supposed to deal in that shit. This is the future which cannot be stopped. - Not our future. - Lev will never have it. We won't need him any longer. If we won't do it, someone else will. And we'll all end up like the old man. They're here. The folks have had it. The woods are the devil's place. - Ain't it so? - Yes! We've paid our dues. With the master's death, we're done. What's your name? Dimitri, ma'am. Your new arrangement starts right now. Ten zloty per run. And fifty if anyone's caught. Screw it! It's over! We move at dusk. Heard the lady, gentlemen? Scram! Back to the sty! Come, men. In time, we'll take it all. I don't know. I'm afraid it won't work. Don't worry, just listen to me. Let's forget it. You're always right, but... What will we do with that bastard? What we did with the father. God, how I hate her! Why do I always have to wait for everything! Because God didn't grant you the gift of foresight. Why didn't you cry at the funeral? 'Cause he didn't like me. He didn't like anyone. It makes no difference. I've told you so many times, family comes first. Are they gone? I want to go with you. - Go where, honey? - To the Soviets. Oh, no, you're staying with auntie! - Let go! - Come here! My little man! Yes! He wants to go! - Auntie! - Give him to me! Give him to me! Auntie! Fucking cunts! Fire! The house is on fire! Our family appreciates your work. We are here for you. We're building our collective future with you. But times have changed and they require new sacrifices from you. Who doesn't understand that is of no use to us. I won't say this again. Let's move! Twenty-five here, another thirteen... plus five. In the name of the Father... If we enlarged the hole, we could save a few seconds. And fall into the hands of the guards. Right, why do anything at all? After all, our lives are wonderful. Clients are just flocking in! Too bad we haven't seen meat in a month. - Don't mock me, please. - I am mocking you? And who makes promises only to embarrass me in front of my fiancée? I never agreed to suicide! And what did you ever agree to? You nasty drunk! You keep following me around, and just turn your nose up at everything! Did you consider what will happen if this fails? I have. And I came to the conclusion that our only failure is you, brother! It's not that I don't believe in us. I'm just not sure I want this. - How do you want to do this? - Easy. - You rotten bastard! - Damn creeps! - Excuse us! - ...36, 37, 38... Albert, what are you doing? - Stop! - Shut up! SAVINGS BANK ...42, 43, 44, 45, 46! Numbers don't lie! How may I help? Never mind. Just look who paid us a visit. Our local mutant. I wonder what is this thing doing in my bank. It has no money. No credit rating either. Seems to me that this is about my daughter! Scram! Don't come back here, you louse! It's an embarrassment for the entire town that this thing lives here! After all, women and children have to look at it! A thing like this belongs in the circus, not among decent people! - To the circus, freaks! - To the circus! To the circus! I'm not done with you, mutant! To the circus! Come on! Get in here! Dump the goods, wait in the barn! Rose Levenfish! The new head of the family. Lev Alinchuk. Welcome. In a moment, you'll see how my son becomes a man. Felix caught a thief today. And in my kingdom there's a prize for that. The privilege of execution. But it seems that my crying Felix has moral scruples. Maybe in the presence of women, he'll feel a surge of courage. Go. Come on! - Stop it! - It's simple! Shoot! When I look at you, I start thinking that your mother screwed around after all. Great! And now, shoot! Shoot! I'm bored out of my mind! I just might become a communist! - Sugar instead of molasses. - Not bad! Although you and your rabble won't really appreciate it. But I like the feeling of a job well done. As the British say, professionalism. I like this word. You should use it sometimes. It would add some refinement to your primitive face. What? Don't you understand English? Or don't you have a concept of a job well done? Get out of here. Business is done. I decide when business is done. And for now... it seems this isn't the only shipment we haven't settled. You had a debt to my father. Upon his death you decided to forget it? Lev... Kill her. Kill her! What are you pulling? We're all friends here! We don't need such friends. For comrade Lenin's sake! Shame on both of you! Lev... I know about all your debts. But since this is a fresh start, I'll forgive them. Just remember. Without me, you don't exist. Payment for this and the previous run. Want to play with it, pretty thing? - Show us your tits! - She has none! Have you lost it? What do you want? And you? What do you want? Something you don't have. Are you sure? In three days, you will get a package. Give it to your red friends, and they will do anything for you. They'll get rid of Lev... and then we... Just imagine that, Felix. First, the goods. Why are you keeping us here so long? For disorderly conduct, mutant. I am a respected citizen of our town, and I won't put up with this! You know what? I'll keep you here until you starve to death. Then I'll bury you in the backyard. Relax, he'll let us go by tomorrow. So? Is this how you want to live? They could put us back in the circus. You forgot the circus? We feared they'd kill one to see what would happen with the other. Do you think it hurts? With the new anaesthesia, they could tear your arm off. What if it fails? It's the best doctor in the world. He's separated many brothers. But first, the baptism. Promise me. Go on, promise. Please! - Fine. I promise. - Really? If I had balls, I'd kill him! I tried once, but after all, he is my father. It's like having a brother. Come on. MUTANT GET OUT! What will he be like without you? Normal. The same. Will you miss him? And me? I don't know. I haven't thought about it. Father wants to marry me off to some Soviet guy. - What? - Just don't tell him! We're going away, so it doesn't matter. We can do it, right? Our community is indescribably grateful for what you're doing for us. We cannot even imagine how we would cope without you. Same here. Should anything important happen, I'll let you know. Let me through. Wake Zbroya up. Zbroya. Zbroya. I hate you, bastard! Could it be cash next time? God be with you. No. Tell me you did it. Come on! Scram! Tell me! Just get the stuff. - May I go with you? - I knew it! - May I go? - Some other time. Stop treating me like a child! A kiss for the road! Just remember, this was my idea! My idea! CLOSED - Albert! - Right there! Just don't break anything! What do you want? The moment we saw your automobile, we decided to rush up and help. My brother was a porter once. I have an artistic soul, I couldn't grasp the job. So, good day. Then again... It's not such a hard task. Especially for such a freak like you two. Don't break anything! Follow me! Miss Levenfish, we've been waiting eagerly. So says your fly. Follow me. Lipka, lead the way. This way, please. On behalf of all my employees, thank you for your continued trust, regardless of family turbulence. On my part, I assure you... that... I will guard your treasures like my daughter's chastity. Here, this is for you. It's a pleasure to help a lady. Take it, you've earned it. Wouldn't be right. You see, Lipka? You should learn from them how not to be greedy! And you should pick this place up! I'm all filthy with this dust. Do you wish to have this counted? No, I don't. For your sake, it better all be there. But of course, every single tiny ring. So... We should go, duty calls. Visit our lab sometime to have your picture taken. Silly! Me? A picture? You are innately photogenic. - Go! - Hudini brothers, at your service. Did you see all those riches? - Will all that be enough? - My fool of a brother! We can do it, Albin. Get it? We can! One, two, three, four... ...eleven, twelve... ...thirty-six, thirty-seven... ...forty-four! The vault is a metre and a half away. One day of digging tops. A small explosion and... I hope that God is with us. What matters is that we are with us, brother! Actually, I need an apprentice. I'm thinking that if the Soviets took some, they'll want more. And my resources are limited. What about Lambert? My sister will never have it. When will I meet her? What's this? A diamond. - Thank you. - Silly, it's for me. So you'd propose. Fuck! Let's have a smoke then. I've always dreamed of a wedding! We shouldn't have it here. Maybe at your palace! Whom will I invite? I don't have anyone. Maybe invite... her. I fucking love you, and you're screwing around? That's Marlene Dietrich! - An actress! - Actress? She's the spitting image of you! What? You never gave me your photo! What have I done? I'm so sorry. Will you marry me? Yes. Why do I always ruin everything? Why? She's an actress! A German! You idiot! Oh, fuck! Sorry, we're closed. I need a picture! Right now! I want to look beautiful! Like an angel! Or I'll rip off your legs! - She's going to kill us! - She's too stupid to notice anything. Let's get this over with. Just smile, please. One, two, three. Just sit still, please, or this isn't going to work! Sorry. Okay, we'll take another one. One, two... three. - How I will ever repay you? - Relax. Gratitude is included in the price. How about moonshine? Moonshine is on the house! How many toys you've got! We could use this someday! I know! PRAYER BOOK A nun! "Lord, the tunnel is now 45 Albert's steps long. Can bad people's money deliver good in the name of God?" Such nonsense. "Jesus, will my brother's deeds be your punishment... for the Levenfish?" You bandits! Hello? Miss Levenfish? Oh, fuck! You bandits! Holy Lord, we killed a man! A woman, Albert! She killed herself, moron! - It's all because of your damn tunnel! - Shut up! We should have gotten baptised! Who will baptise us now? Shut up! Let me think! You shut up! The town wakes up in an hour. Shut up! Oh, fuck! Albert, let's run! Where to, you moron? Grab her. Come on! Let's think this through. She was alone, no one saw her with us. We'll burn in hell! The Bible says, "What God joined together, let no man separate!" Should we bury or drown them? Drive to the lake! In the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me! Stop babbling! - Be not afraid! - You're going to kill us! - Be not afraid! - Stop it! I dreamt of crows. You know what that means. But she's fine. Probably just fornicating with that junkie. - We should send the men. - We should calm down. Stop! Stop! Stop! The road is closed! Stop! Back up, please! No passage today! Inspector Stanislawa Kochaj. Thank God. Junior inspector Maciej Abazur. What happened here? A horrible accident. They must have skidded and crashed into the tree. And then the gun went off. Or it went off first, then they skidded, and she got impaled on a screwdriver. I'm figuring it out. - You've been drinking? - No. Yes. I don't know. Who are the stiffs? This here, is our Chief Welna. - And the woman? - The oldest of the Levenfish sisters. Levenfish? - They were lovers and all that? - Oh, no. The chief was queer, and she... as you can see. Horrible tragedy. - Lauper, the photographer, still alive? - Oh, no. But he trained two successors. One is enough. Stay and don't touch anything. Think who could have wanted them dead. Wanted? Dead? The tiger! Albert, her stuff. Let me see! Holy Trinity! What's this? Levenfish drugs! Oh, fuck! - They'll be looking for this! - Nobody knows she was here. - You think they won't find out? - How? - Who's there? - Shut up! Hide it! We're closed. No work on the Sabbath. Will you let me in, sir? I mean, sirs, will you let me in or are going to hang here like this. Come in. Don't step on the new tiger, as... it's new. Inspector Kochaj, Internal Affairs. Albert Hudini, a photographer. Albin Hudini, junior sidekick. You have to come with me. Where to? To a crime scene. We need to inspect it, and without you, it's impossible. We'll do what we can, and you'll be free to go. Inspect it? Right, I get it. Inspect it. Usually, I catch criminals in three days. It would be better for this one if he was caught sooner. Why? Because one of the victims is Zbroya Levenfish. We're going to notify her family of her death. Stay away. Now you. Assume a stable position. Level the upper edge of the sight with the edge of the gunpoint. Do you feel the breeze? Move the aim to the left edge of the bottle. Take a deep breath. Exhale. Now, don't breathe. Flex your muscles... You're a bastard. I can't talk to you! Gun. That's against procedure and all that. If so, you have a minute to leave the property. They always this jumpy? Inspector Stanislawa Kochaj. Internal Affairs. - Is everything okay? - That we'll see. I regret that we meet in such sad circumstances, but your police chief, a one Welna, is dead. And you want to replace him? I'm not here to replace anyone. Then why are you wasting my time? That's not all. Your sister was with him. Gather the men! I get that you're acting under emotion, but leave the matter to the authorities. I'm the authority here. Not your father? One more word and you'll end up like your brother. Auntie Zbroya, where is she? Let me go! This is all your fault! - You're cursed! - Quiet! Lila, wait! Someone wants to destroy our family. Only you and I can stop this. Find out who did this. Retrieve what's ours. Then you'll take Zbroya's place. Go! Someone put in a lot of effort to make this it look like... an accident. She must have had something worth more than her life with her. The family will look for it, until they find it. Maybe they lost it on the way. - Maybe they didn't. - Maybe not. One marker, one shot. - You're going to ruin the photo! - And that's the point! Everything will be okay! I can take it back! I can solve this! I can figure all this out! I will solve this, I swear! I'm sure. For now, move the chief's body and notify the undertaker. Of course. I'll solve this thing. How did you even know about this accident? I didn't. I came here for an entirely different reason. Wait at the station. Be my guests. We're done here anyway. - Does she... - I don't know. - Albin... - Shut up! And forget what you have done. - Helena! - Let go! Albin, Albert, help me! - Shut up! - Help! Helena, stop! - Let her go! - Helena! On your knees, mutant! Right now! Let's go! - They're going to the Soviets! - What? First the tunnel, then Helena. You're too late. My father is dead. I'm not here for revenge. I just want to come to terms. With all this. Twelve years. Time really flies. - Thank you for taking care of him. - I owed him that. We both did. Will you stay? A lot is going on here. Maybe it's justice? Question is, by whose hand? Why do you care? Maybe I owe him this. Maybe we both do and all that. Get in. The master calls. Look how everything wonderfully falls apart. And you don't even know who killed your sister. - We'll find out. - You won't find out shit. - It doesn't concern you. - It does. My son works just for me now. And his goddamn business is my goddamn business. Rose made her choice, and you? When you got pregnant with Kochaj, your father nearly lost his mind. His beloved daughter betrayed the family with their biggest enemy. But your daddy loved you. And wanted to let you leave. But Rose, as always, knew better what to do. She killed Kochaj and took Lambert away from you. Your father knew that if you found out, nothing would save Rose. That's why he took it upon himself. He knew that only his word could keep the family together. I'll come to the funeral. We'll do it then. You'll get your son back and avenge his father. Constable? Coward and all that. Stasia? Kochaj? What can I say? How did you get here, for Christ's sake? Just passing through. I hoped you were still around. I'm still breathing, but if things go on like this... Everyone's days are well numbered here. We'll run out of trees for coffins soon. Seems like it. Look. Oh, my, that's... And who are you? What are you doing? Don't pour that out! It's expensive! Just go or I'll shoot you! You're that sister Zbroya was supposed to kill! She said something about some father and son. Zbroya is dead. What? How? Just like that. You killed her! You killed her! The business is finished. Leave this place. And forget you were ever here. Curiosity got the best of me, and I took a look at the stiff. I think it was a good call, as this is all wrong. Take a look. He's got multiple bruises and contusions, broken ribs, a crushed pelvis. Something must have smashed into him with great force. But this happened earlier. So, he wasn't driving. Neither was Zbroya. Now, check this out. Here. There's wool on his prick. Fresh sheep wool. Lots of it. Wool? Lila, stop! How long have you served our family? From the beginning. - And you? - Since my father before me. And you come here with nothing? - No leads in the villages. - Nor in town. Not a trace at the border. Someone steals my goods, murders my sister, and you know nothing? - If you had listened to us then... - Silence! Everyone be silent! You wanted to destroy me from the start. You let a rat into our midst! But you never thought that I'd find it. Maybe one of you is behind this? Who is it? - Clearly the Soviets! - Quiet, child! - I'm no child! - Yes, you are! Give me a few men, and I'll do what you can't! The chemist is gone. All the goods are lost. Ma'am, the moonshine shed's burned down! I'm going to the Soviets. And you, get out of my sight! To all our brothers' joy! In the name of the Revolution and for all time to come! I pronounce you man and wife! Now, kiss! Kiss! What are you afraid of? Don't you know you're in the Soviet Union? We share everything here. Like brothers. Let's share this. Put the popgun away and scram. See you later, beautiful. I don't know about you, but I'm out of here. - You could take me with you. - Well, you are my husband. We'll have a happy life. I definitely will. Listen. I know where to get money from. Serious money. If you help me, we can pretend a little, and then go our separate ways. You don't realise where you are. And you how much the Levenfish have. What? There's a tunnel to their vault. If we hurry, we'll get there first. Great. We'll pay a return visit to my father. He'll throw us a banquet. You enjoy a little drink! Now, slap me. Come on! - The soil is giving way. - I can see. Faster! - Albin! - Albert! There! A steel wall. Hush! You were right, brother. Numbers don't lie! Are you afraid? - A bit. And you? - Yeah. Me too. Thank you. What for? For everything. What would I do without you, my fool of a brother? - Want to blow it? - We should wait till dark. - All right, let's go. - Where? I promised you, didn't I? What is your name? What is your name? Albin? What is your name? Albin. What do you want from the church of God? Faith. What will faith give you? Life eternal. If you wish for eternal life, love thy brother as yourself. I christen you, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. I welcome you among the lambs of God, my brother. - I wonder what was there before us. - Before us? Other people came before us. We just need to find the marked out trail. And where we expected to see evil, we'll find goodness. And all this time I thought that our journey was outward. And it turns out, my brother, we're reaching the core of the sense of existence. What do I see there? That you and I are one. The sense of existence! Albin... My brother! Albin... Helena. Oh, fuck! Well, well, look who's here. I'm done drinking with you, Lipka. My dear friend, I'd like you to meet someone. This is our local mutant who entertains this crazy idea that I, Lipka, would give him my Helena in marriage. Run! Dear Lev, please accept this mutant as a gift. May he entertain you and serve you, and let this be a token of our eternal friendship. Grab them! - Gentlemen! - Come on! - Actually... - We're leaving! - Are we? - No. Not this time. Gentlemen! What is this? You can't do this! No one will call us a mutant! What a fantastic animal! Time to go! Change of plans. On the floor! Now! Albin! - Holy Mother, what's happened? - Helena! - The tunnel! - Got your beauty sleep? Let's go then. You've disappointed me and all that. You kick up rows with such things going on in town? What things? What things? If the Soviets forced your fiancée into marriage, you'd kick up rows as well. Helena Lipka? You and her? And why not? It's a scandal that I am being held here against my will. He started it, I was defending myself, witnesses will confirm. I can't be responsible for his drunken antics. If that's all, I'll be on my way. - Albin... - Albert! What am I to do with you? That's you're problem. - And if they come to get you? - Who? Those whose... bones you crushed. I can handle it, as you can see. Do you at least have those photos? Of course. What is there to say? What is there to say, God, when you summon yet another innocent lamb? A woman. As beautiful and noble, as the heart of your son... a human being. That fucker! Shut up and stay out of this. Hide inside the house, please. We need to talk. We do. You've lost control. Great that you came here to tell me that just now. You seem to have forgotten that we've survived this long because we've stuck to the rules. Which allow your son to deceive me? This is about him? That asymmetrical fool? You fell for him? This is beyond my understanding. But maybe it's simple? Maybe it's just one big hole in the sky! That's how I'll remember you. Beautiful, complicated, but still stupid. Cunt! What have you done? They killed our sister. You were next in line. I was supposed to do it. Together we'll survive. Wait. Let's play them. Put Lev in the car! And you, convey our best regards to your new master. They started the war. You must finish it. The time has come to purge the Soviet scum from our land! Gather the men! Come on, men! And you, bury her. She's your sister too. Oh, God! She never looked this good when she was alive! This is how we'll remember her. Who dressed her up? - She had this on. - That's how she died. At least on her deathbed she looked like an angel. Like Marlene. - Pack Lambert. - What? And take him to town. Jail, cops, drunkard brother! Here I am, such shame in my old age! Who's going to cover our costs? - Will you? - Yeah! Who will pay us back for... There. He fainted! Moonshine, hurry! - Someone's been in here! - Shut up! Drink! Your photos are in the darkroom. Everyone knows! So does she. Why are they so... Bandits! In the name of the law... The tunnel! Hurry! - Now what? - Pray it isn't true. - I love you, brother! - I love you too. Screw those racists! - Where's your God now? - Leave him out of this! - Why did he take our money? - It wasn't him! Understand, moron. God doesn't love you! - He does! - Neither me nor you! He loves me! Get it? Shut up! What are you doing, idiot? Helena. But they'll kill us, moron! She's all that we have left, my brother. Dump the gun! Police! My money... - Where's my money? - Where's the mutant? - What are you saying? - Your daughter... Where's your daughter? She came alone and won't talk to anyone but you. - Father's back? - In two hours. - Get out! Deal with this idiot! - Get the hell out of here! Why are you here? Go back to your place! I see marriage serves you well. What do you want? Only what's mine. There never was anything here that could belong to you. That's what I thought. Give my regards to your father. They're coming! - What was that? - Come on! Who's shooting? Where's the driver? Find the driver! - Where's Olin? - He's gone! - What's with Olin? - I don't know! - Close the gate! - You heard him! Grenade! Run! Come on, shoot! Help me! Help! Wait! You said they wouldn't know it was us. So, I was wrong. - They killed my father. - And so what? That's what you wanted! You wanted to be a man, and now you're pissing your pants? - Guys! - Helena! Come on! - Helena, come! - Help me! - You're alive! - Hurry! These are the treasures from the bank! Come on! We are saved! Lambert... You've killed her. I haven't killed anyone. You've destroyed my family. Everything I did, I did for you. So we could be together. I hate you! I hate you all! Lambert, no! She's your mother. My mother's dead. Sayonara, mutant. No! Albert! Albert, no! Albert. Albert, no. Finally, we'll know if one dies, will the other die too. - I'll be seeing you, brother. - No, Albert! No! Albert, no! Oh, God! Why have you forsaken me? Albert! Albert, come on, let's go. Albert, come on! Easy. I'll get help. Fucking hell and all that. BUTCHER Who will baptise me, who will forgive me, though it wasn't I who killed? Was it you, my Lord, who made Albert turn to sin, and sends me into sin? Holy Mother! One! Two! Faster! Move it! Go! Muso... Bela! Hudini! Give me that! PRAYER BOOK
