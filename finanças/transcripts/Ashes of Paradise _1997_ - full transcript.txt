ASHES FROM PARADISE ﻿A good start, Judge. ﻿We have multiple wounds ﻿with a knife. ﻿Time? -The engine was on, ﻿the trunk closed. ﻿Too much ﻿heat. ﻿From 7 ﻿to 11 hours ﻿From 7 ﻿to 11 hours. ﻿They came to notify ﻿Judge Macantasis' suicide. ﻿Nobody ﻿answered... but the garage's door ﻿was half open. ﻿Excuse me Would you like ﻿to talk to him now? ﻿No. ﻿Who lives ﻿in the house? ﻿At least two ﻿of the three brothers. ﻿Pablo the young man ﻿we saw downstairs... and Alejandro, ﻿his younger brother. ﻿We still haven't been able ﻿to locate him... ﻿or the oldest one, ﻿Nicolas Macantasis. ﻿During ﻿the day... there's a woman who does ﻿the housework for them. ﻿A certain Isabel Guemes. ﻿-Alright. ﻿You question the neighbors. ﻿I'll talk to the employee. ﻿Bring me what evidence ﻿you can find at 11:00. ﻿Were you able to identify ﻿the victim? I ﻿was saving that pearl ﻿for last. ﻿She was Ana Muro. Francisco ﻿Muro's only daughter. ﻿-Hi! - Good morning! ﻿With the city full of ﻿garbage and 86 degrees F? ﻿With the humidity index, ﻿it's 96 degrees. ﻿Good morning. ﻿Chief Mendez called. ﻿-Good morning. ﻿Good morning, Your Honor. ﻿The honor is mine... ﻿Go out, please. ﻿Well, I'm Judge Beatriz Teller. ﻿I won't question you now... and you needn't speak ﻿if you don't wish to. ﻿You have the right to name ﻿a lawyer. I killed her. ﻿Have a seat, ﻿please. ﻿-I killed her. ﻿-I heard you. Sit down, please. ﻿lf you decide ﻿not to choose one, I will... ﻿I killed her ﻿on my own. ﻿Would you like ﻿some water'? ﻿Can we get this over with? ﻿I killed her. ﻿-Take my statement ﻿and I'll sign it. Sign what? ﻿How many times must I say it? ﻿That I killed her! ﻿On your ﻿own? ﻿The victim ﻿was called...? ﻿Ana. ﻿She would have been 23 ﻿tomorrow. No... ﻿Today. You can write "22". ﻿What did you do ﻿with my father? ﻿You know ﻿the procedure. ﻿What about ﻿his murderers? ﻿Can't we do this ﻿more quickly? ﻿Can't we do this ﻿more quickly? ﻿You are a lawyer. ﻿You know we can't. I was. ﻿Your brother next door ﻿has just declared himself.. guilty ﻿of the' same murder. ﻿Alejandro, he's crazy! ﻿lf you let him talk...! ﻿Alejandro! Nico, ﻿what are you doing here? ﻿What have ﻿you done? ﻿Let go of him and leave, ﻿please. Sit down. ﻿We'll take the call. ﻿Yes, Judge Teller. ﻿Could you repeat ﻿that? ﻿Thank you. ﻿Alejandro Macantasis ﻿is your other brother? ﻿He's out of danger, but ﻿he tried to commit suicide... ﻿and, wrote a note saying he's ﻿guilty of the same murder. ﻿What kind of game ﻿do you think you're playing? I'm Judge ﻿Beatriz Teller. ﻿Mr Muro, you can't identify ﻿your daughter's body now. ﻿Ana? ﻿Ana? ﻿You should ﻿have killed me, Ana ﻿You should ﻿have killed me, child. ﻿Give me the lady's personal ﻿data and I... Excuse me. ﻿Judge, the Macantasis' ﻿employee is waiting. ﻿Let her ﻿wait. ﻿Hypothesis 1: ﻿the judge killed her. ﻿They're covering up ﻿for their father. ﻿We need the time ﻿of death. ﻿Judge Macantasis ﻿died at 9:30 PM. ﻿Then maybe ﻿he had time. ﻿Hypothesis 2: ﻿the three of them killed her. ﻿Hypothesis 3: One of them ﻿killed her... but the other two ﻿were involved in some way. ﻿Without ﻿coordination? ﻿Anything unpremeditated ﻿is chaotic, Yety. What does Muro mean by "you should've killed me"? ﻿Why does he feel responsible ﻿for her death? ﻿Let's pray Muro ﻿has nothing to do with it. ﻿The farther away from ﻿money and power, the better. ﻿One minute, ﻿five grand. ﻿-You can send him a message. ﻿-No. I must talk to him. ﻿Take your clothes off. ﻿After your bath... ﻿Now! ﻿Slow down. ﻿Slow down! ﻿Do you think you can ﻿order me around, big shot? ﻿I'm paying you 5 grand. ﻿And I never forget ﻿a favor. "Slug" Martini is on the judge's case. ﻿-Judge Martini. ﻿He caught me just as... ﻿Judge, could you ﻿give me a minute? ﻿Come in, ﻿Judge Martini. ﻿I'm on Macantasis' case, ﻿Judge. ﻿Could we talk alone, ﻿please? ﻿Of course ﻿we can. ﻿Judge, I'm afraid we have a ﻿little competence problem here. ﻿Muro's and Macantasis' cases ﻿are obviously connected... and I think I should ﻿handle them both. ﻿I haven't found any evidence ﻿they're connected. ﻿-Have you? ﻿-No, not yet. ﻿But there's something weird ﻿in our colleague's death. ﻿lt's obvious he killed himself ﻿to avoid a scandal. ﻿We should deal with this ﻿with extreme caution. ﻿Don't you ﻿think so? ﻿I don't understand ﻿a word you're saying. ﻿Could we speak more frankly, ﻿﻿please? ﻿We will, ﻿if it's necessary. ﻿Thank you for your time, ﻿Judge... Deller. ﻿Teller. ﻿He left ﻿squirming. ﻿Calling him "slug" ﻿is too generous. ﻿Some say his late colleague ﻿was into extortion. ﻿-Victims? -If they know it, ﻿they're not saying it. ﻿Do we know anyone ﻿in Macantasis' court? ﻿We know some, ﻿not too much. ﻿But we can ﻿get closer. ﻿Am I corrupting you, ﻿Yety? ﻿Sorry I'm late. ﻿-Good morning, Mendez. ﻿-Good morning. ﻿I'm going ﻿to the trench. ﻿-Let's see. -So we have ﻿three confessions. ﻿Nice case ﻿for Christmas! ﻿According to the neighbors' ﻿statements... the three Macantasis ﻿brothers... could have been together ﻿at the time of murder. ﻿Pablo Macantasis. ﻿25 years old. A lawyer. ﻿Pablo Macantasis. ﻿25 years old. A lawyer. ﻿He has his own office. ﻿No enemies. ﻿Very angry. "The police, ﻿like always, are mistaken." ﻿Plays football ﻿on Thursday. ﻿Assistant professor ﻿of "Philosophy of Law". ﻿He dated the two lawyers, ﻿the notary, the secretary. ﻿The guy used ﻿to be unstoppable. ﻿-What? -If they are so angry ﻿with the police... how did you make them ﻿tell you about his affairs? ﻿Nicolas ﻿Macantasis. ﻿He's a cardiologist. ﻿He works in a hospital ﻿and two clinics. ﻿They love him ﻿very much, too. He couldn't have killed a fly. He was unstoppable, too. ﻿He had a girlfriend, ﻿but went back to his parents'. ﻿-He never had any money. ﻿-Why? ﻿lt seems doctors ﻿don't earn much. ﻿Alejandro Macantasis. ﻿23 years old. ﻿A journalistic ﻿photographer. ﻿The only brother who has ﻿no reputation as a hot shot. ﻿But curiously enough, ﻿he was the victim's boyfriend. ﻿-Sit down, Isabel. ﻿Nicolas... ﻿-Sit down. ﻿-What happened? ﻿You shut up. ﻿Shut up. ﻿Don't push her, ﻿please! ﻿-Why is she here7 ﻿-Ask your lawyer. ﻿You have ﻿to take him back. ﻿The same ﻿way? ﻿lsabel, ﻿don't cry. Don't cry. ﻿They're doing it on purpose. ﻿Don't cry. Go home. ﻿Don't cry! ﻿ls that ﻿your style? ﻿To prove you can drag me ﻿around like a dog? ﻿Calm down ﻿or this won't work. ﻿With Isabel out there, ﻿crying? ﻿She didn't kill ﻿anyone. ﻿But ﻿of course... that doesn't matter, ﻿does it? ﻿Not even who killed Ana ﻿matters! ﻿That's not ﻿your job. ﻿Your Honor will use us ﻿to cover up... our dad's murder, ﻿right? ﻿-Right? -You're here because ﻿you confessed to a murder. ﻿You've covered it up ﻿already? ﻿He committed ﻿suicide? ﻿Nico! ﻿She didn't do it, ﻿Nico! ﻿Why, then, ﻿you son of a bitch! ﻿Why! ﻿Why, you son ﻿of a bitch! ﻿Why then! ﻿Why! ﻿-He's missing, the secretary... ﻿lriarte. ﻿Since yesterday. Macantasis ﻿had just been with the girl. ﻿Ten minutes. ﻿She came out... with the same folder ﻿she went in with. ﻿And Secretary Iriarte ﻿came out with Macantasis. ﻿Who was ﻿the girl? ﻿Don't you ﻿know? ﻿She was ﻿Ana Muro. ﻿Mr. Alejandro Macantasis, ﻿I'm Judge Beatriz Teller... and I'm in charge of the case ﻿of Ana Muro's death. ﻿Murder. ﻿I did it. ﻿We don't have ﻿to talk about this now. ﻿We don't have to talk at all ﻿if you don't want to. ﻿The doctors say ﻿you're out of danger ﻿Being dead ﻿would be out of danger. ﻿Did they give you ﻿my letter? ﻿Yes. ﻿Everything's there. ﻿The seal isn't clear. I can't ﻿do anything without the date. ﻿-Good evening. - ﻿Good evening. ﻿Secretary. ﻿What time did I ask to have ﻿Nicolas Macantasis brought? ﻿The warden didn't answer ﻿the phone, as usual. ﻿Yes, I told Patricia. ﻿Didn't they bring him? ﻿I needed the employee ﻿to see him and understand... it's a serious situation ﻿before committing perjury. ﻿Not shoving him around! ﻿lt shouldn't happen again. ﻿How did it go in the trenches? ﻿With Macantasis' ﻿people... ﻿you can't even mention ﻿the word "extortion". ﻿Total loyalty ﻿and devotion. ﻿Guess who took charge ﻿of that court... and its loyal ﻿crew? "Slug" Martini. ﻿Yesterday Macantasis ﻿left his office with Iriarte... 10 minutes before ﻿he jumped from the terrace. Secretary Iriarte ﻿hasn't been seen since. ﻿Who was the last person ﻿the judge saw in his office? ﻿Cut the suspense, ﻿Yety. ﻿Our victim ﻿Ana Muro. ﻿-Yes? ﻿-Excuse me, Judge. ﻿-Yes? - ﻿Excuse me, Judge. ﻿Someone wants ﻿to see you. ﻿I can't see ﻿anyone else today. ﻿This woman ﻿Dolores Martinez... ﻿she says she's a friend ﻿of Ana Muro. ﻿She would've ﻿never left. ﻿Francisco adored her ﻿and she adored him. ﻿Until Ana ﻿left. ﻿lt was ﻿my fault. ﻿She left what ﻿because of you? ﻿Her house. ﻿Her father's house. ﻿Why did they ﻿kill her? ﻿Francisco ﻿says... But that's ﻿impossible. ﻿Does he have an explanation ﻿you're not telling us? ﻿Yesterday... ﻿Ana... ﻿came to get ﻿some things. ﻿Clothes, ﻿books. ﻿And Francisco ﻿arrived... and tried ﻿to stop her. As Ana was leaving, he shouted: "They want to use you ﻿to destroy me." ﻿They must have ﻿followed her. ﻿They were always ﻿following her. ﻿Do you recognize ﻿the deceased? ﻿Yes. ﻿He's my father ﻿Costa Macantasis. ﻿On the left! That one ﻿dressed up as a kid! ﻿Three girls ﻿are after him. ﻿Not after him, ﻿after one of his cars! ﻿There's the heir ﻿behind! ﻿Such a great chick ﻿with such a jerk! ﻿Take the old guy ﻿there. ﻿That one with a belly ﻿over there. ﻿-He's famous. ﻿All of them are. ﻿We're socializing, ﻿remember? ﻿lsn't that Muro? ﻿That one's difficult ﻿to get. ﻿Do your best. I'll find out ﻿who the chick is. - ﻿Who are you taking, kid? - ﻿Don't touch the camera. ﻿-Easy. Give me the film. ﻿Don't touch the camera! ﻿Are you a jerk ﻿or what? ﻿Leave him alone, ﻿Toni. ﻿Where did you ﻿get it? ﻿The clock? ﻿My mom gave it to me. ﻿My dad gave it ﻿to me. ﻿The same ﻿one? ﻿I don't have any brothers ﻿What about you? ﻿I have ﻿two. ﻿Younger? ﻿Are you ﻿the youngest? ﻿No, just the last one ﻿to be born. ﻿Looking ﻿for a brother7 ﻿You're more than ﻿I could take in pictures. ﻿Everybody's more. ﻿Hardly anyone. ﻿-Some water? ﻿-I thought you were gone. ﻿I'm not leaving. ﻿Never. ﻿Ole! ﻿Lift me. ﻿Pablo knows something ﻿that made Nicolas crazy. What's the meaning of "she didn't do it" ﻿What do we know ﻿about Ana Muro? ﻿She's 22. Only child born ﻿to Francisco Muro... ﻿and Teresa Alvarez Corral, ﻿alias "Tiqui". -Alias? ﻿The police ﻿are incredible. ﻿Tiqui Alvarez Corral ﻿was a famous model. ﻿Suddenly ﻿she disappeared. ﻿When they divorced, ﻿she was 4 years old. ﻿She stayed ﻿with her father. ﻿She Was studying ﻿Anthropology. ﻿Everything ﻿normal. ﻿lsn't it ﻿fantastic? "﻿They were three brothers ﻿and she was a saint." The tango says "﻿five brothers", Yeti. ﻿Let's see. Ana had ﻿an argument with her father... and went to see ﻿the judge. ﻿There's something between ﻿the Muros and the Macantasis. Muro said: "They'll use you ﻿to destroy me." ﻿There's something there, ﻿Yeti. ﻿There's definitely ﻿something. ﻿Why are they ﻿in jail? ﻿Those kids ﻿didn't kill anyone! ﻿That people who ﻿threatened him on the phone... ﻿they are the ones ﻿who must have killed her. Who ﻿threatened ﻿him? ﻿-We never knew ﻿-Who did they threaten? ﻿The judge. He reported it ﻿to the police. Three times. ﻿Why don't you look ﻿for them? ﻿Why do you say the judge ﻿committed suicide? ﻿I can't answer that, ﻿Mrs Guemes. ﻿You don't want to. ﻿Some answers I don't know. ﻿Others, I can't give you. ﻿How did you meet ﻿Ana Muro? ﻿That first ﻿day. ﻿After the first night ﻿she stayed with Alejandro. ﻿Did girls usually stay ﻿the night with Alejandro...? ﻿Never. No one ever stayed, ﻿except her. ﻿She never ﻿left. ﻿Alejandro loved her so much ﻿I was afraid. ﻿One day I asked her ﻿if she would get married. ﻿lt was ﻿a silly question. ﻿But she said ﻿yes. ﻿She said: "I'm going to marry ﻿all of you, forever." ﻿All of you? Judge Macantasis too? ﻿How did the judge ﻿get along with Ana Muro? ﻿He wasn't ﻿always there. ﻿Sometimes he'd stay ﻿the whole weekend at home. ﻿But he usually ﻿stayed downtown. ﻿What was their ﻿relationship like? ﻿What could it be like? ﻿He was happy. Happy? ﻿Did he like Ana Muro ﻿a lot? ﻿Happy ﻿for Alejandro. ﻿Was Pablo happy for him? ﻿What about Nicolas? ﻿They're decent ﻿people. ﻿A decent ﻿family. ﻿There's a body. A body ﻿with fifteen stab wounds. ﻿The children ﻿didn't do it. ﻿They say ﻿they did. ﻿They say ﻿that? Why? ﻿That's the question, ﻿Mrs Guemes. ﻿-Why do they say they ﻿killed her? That's a lie! ﻿Why are they ﻿lying? ﻿To protect ﻿their father? ﻿What are you ﻿talking about? ﻿Costa is dead and you want ﻿to dirty his name. ﻿Ana Muro is dead, ﻿too ﻿Don't give me soap operas, ﻿Mrs Guemes. ﻿There are real ﻿corpses here. ﻿The rest ﻿are all lies. ﻿Hello? ﻿Drop dead, ﻿you bastard! ﻿Good morning, baby brother! ﻿-Morning, second one. ﻿I see you don't only live ﻿on kisses. ﻿You don't see ﻿anything. ﻿Leave her alone ﻿for once, jerk. ﻿Still locked up in there, ﻿little one? ﻿Lovers? ﻿Ana. ﻿-Before Ana. ﻿-There's no before. ﻿-You can't lie on that stool. ﻿-Don't ever think I lie. ﻿I don't know ﻿how to lie. Fears? ﻿Cockroaches, rats, ﻿reptiles... ﻿Ana. ﻿Real fears. ﻿My dad was beside my bed ﻿waiting for me to wake up. ﻿He said Mom ﻿was leaving... ﻿and that I had to choose ﻿who to live with. ﻿She was at the door with ﻿those mirror glasses I hated. ﻿She seemed ﻿to be in a hurry. ﻿I hugged my dad... to say goodbye to him, ﻿I think. ﻿And I saw her turn around ﻿and go out. ﻿I heard her until she closed ﻿the front door. And my dad told me: "﻿Alone at last, ﻿Ana." ﻿You're looking ﻿for me. A partner, for an interview. ﻿No the appointment ﻿is with me. ﻿I'm the photographer. ﻿Alejandro Macantasis. ﻿-My partner will be here ﻿in a minute. He's left. ﻿-Would you like a drink? ﻿-Water, please. ﻿Miss, please. Mineral water ﻿and a cup of coffee. ﻿lt's best taking the pictures ﻿during the interview... but you must be used ﻿to this. ﻿Do you like ﻿your job? ﻿-Yes. Do you like yours? ﻿-Some days. ﻿Are you a pictures freak? ﻿ls it your calling? ﻿-Always taking pictures? ﻿-No, I live, too. ﻿How do you ﻿live? I live well, thanks. ﻿Look here, please. ﻿That's alright. Enough. ﻿Sit down. - ﻿I have another interview. - ﻿Tomorrow, maybe. ﻿Today you have all the time ﻿of the world just for me. ﻿You could've told me ﻿you just wanted to know me. ﻿Everyone has ﻿their own style. ﻿Yours is showing power ﻿from the beginning. ﻿Yours is showing power ﻿from the beginning. ﻿lf you don't use it, ﻿you loose it. ﻿Tell me, how did you ﻿seduce my Ana? ﻿She's not ﻿easy. ﻿I didn't seduce ﻿your Ana. ﻿Do you think ﻿it'll last? ﻿Don't bet ﻿against it. ﻿You forgot all about it, ﻿you jerk! ﻿Forgot? -Dad's birthday ﻿We'll be down right away. ﻿Right away, asshole? ﻿He's been asking for you! ﻿And your girlfriend, ﻿of course. ﻿Don't you want us to meet? ﻿-Yes. You'll like him. ﻿Pablo! ﻿Poor Nicolas. It's not that ﻿he does bad. He gets a girl... but then Pablo comes ﻿and takes her from him. ﻿Not take them. ﻿They come to me. ﻿The ones ﻿I let go. ﻿The thing is you are colder, like Dad. ﻿I envy that, ﻿you know. ﻿But not ﻿so much. ﻿You can imagine none ﻿of that is true. ﻿They've always ﻿been shy. ﻿Come. ﻿Let go of me! ﻿Nicolas, help me here! ﻿They hardly knew ﻿their mother. ﻿-And they inherited my worst ﻿faults. For instance? ﻿For instance... they ask everything ﻿they want to know. ﻿You can ask, ﻿Mr. Judge. ﻿You're Francisco Muro's ﻿daughter, aren't you? ﻿Yes. ﻿Do you know him? ﻿Not personally. ﻿But who doesn't know him? ﻿Almost ﻿no one. ﻿The one in the magazines ﻿isn't my father. ﻿You've done miracles ﻿with Alejandro. ﻿-How's that? ﻿-We love each other. ﻿That's a good ﻿answer. ﻿A complete ﻿answer. ﻿Would you like some cake? ﻿lt's delicious! ﻿We really ﻿love each other. ﻿I've no doubt ﻿about it. ﻿Alejandro doesn't do ﻿things halfway. ﻿Ever. ﻿Hey! ﻿You're grown-ups! ﻿Pablo? Teach me Greek dancing. ﻿No, it's not ﻿for women. ﻿-Who said it wasn't? ﻿-You did, Dad! ﻿-They pretend to be primitive. ﻿-So it was a lie. ﻿No, Ana ﻿it's not for women. ﻿What do women do in Greece ﻿while men dance? ﻿-They admire them. ﻿-Exactly. ﻿That's Grandma's ﻿son! ﻿You shouldn't have broken ﻿that one, jerk! ﻿I'm happy! ﻿Time of death: Between 8 pm ﻿and 9 pm, December 16th. ﻿Fifteen injuries. ﻿One mortal... ﻿and 14 of different ﻿angles and intensities. ﻿Just one ﻿mortal injury. ﻿lt would have been ﻿enough. ﻿lt was ﻿the first one. ﻿You don't remember ﻿the number of stabs. I stabbed her ﻿without counting. ﻿You don't remember ﻿what you did with the weapon. No, but I remember very well ﻿that I did kill her. ﻿My clothes were analyzed. ﻿lt was her blood. ﻿You saw me there. What else ﻿do you need, Your Honor? ﻿Details. ﻿A motive. ﻿Ask Muro. ﻿Warden! ﻿-Get me out of here, please! ﻿-Son of a bitch! ﻿Are we all crazy ﻿here? - ﻿Tell me he cut me! - ﻿Two inches, please! ﻿Stop the bleeding! ﻿He's dying! ﻿You take care of him! ﻿lt's an emergency! ﻿That son of a bitch ﻿cut me deep! ﻿-Who's in charge here? ﻿-We're busy here! ﻿Son of a bitch! ﻿-Don't talk! ﻿Don't talk! ﻿lt's bad for you. Please! ﻿lt's my responsibility, ﻿dammit! ﻿Everybody out of here! ﻿Hurry! ﻿Clear off, ﻿please! - ﻿What happened? - It hurts! ﻿What's going on? ﻿-Here! Here! ﻿You're a surgeon. ﻿bastard! ﻿-Anesthetize him! - Don't! ﻿Calm down! ﻿Nobody's going to do that! ﻿Don't say anything, please. ﻿Leave it to me. ﻿Ale, ﻿it was my fault. ﻿Where are ﻿you going? ﻿lt was my fault, Ale. ﻿She loved you, I swear. - ﻿Come here! - ﻿lt was you she loved, Ale! ﻿Ale! It was you ﻿she loved, Ale! ﻿Ana loved ﻿you! ﻿Hey! You re not a thief, ﻿are you? ﻿I'm stealing ﻿water. ﻿My brother used to be ﻿kinder to women. ﻿He's ﻿sleeping. ﻿Well, he used to be ﻿more awake. ﻿Do you want ﻿some water? ﻿I thought ﻿you were gone. ﻿I'll never leave. ﻿Hello? ﻿Just a second. ﻿lt's ﻿for you. ﻿Hello? ﻿Where did you get ﻿this number? ﻿I wrote you ﻿I was alright. I'm not your little girl, ﻿Daddy. ﻿The one who sleeps ﻿with you is. ﻿I have to go. ﻿They're waiting for me. No! ﻿Dolores, my best friend ﻿she's studying in Paris. ﻿She came home to spend ﻿a month with me. ﻿She slept two nights ﻿in my room. Then in Dad's. It's not a very interesting story. ﻿Well, it depends. ﻿Does Alejandro know? ﻿What does Alejandro ﻿have to do with it? ﻿Don't you think ﻿this thing is a bit sick? ﻿Clinically, falling in love ﻿may be dangerous... ﻿but fucking ﻿is great. ﻿I'm serious! Besides ﻿you should take care of it. ﻿I don't live here. ﻿-I put rubbers everywhere! ﻿Don't put on that tie, Dad. ﻿-Why not? It's silk. I've had it ﻿for 20 years! That's why. ﻿lt's elegant ﻿and it's silk! ﻿What happened ﻿with your girlfriend? ﻿Did she send you away ﻿again? ﻿Something ﻿like that. ﻿Oh, God... Whenever ﻿will I be a grandpa? ﻿Take your ﻿time. ﻿Get dressed while Isabel ﻿and I do all the work. ﻿That kid has ﻿such a temper! Wait! ﻿Are you tying ﻿the knot, too? ﻿There's your ﻿son's temper. ﻿What about this girl? ﻿She isn't a nutcase, is she? No, ﻿not this one. ﻿Do you think it normal ﻿she staying here with you? ﻿Normal? Don't you think ﻿a 62-year-old boy... could bring his girlfriend ﻿to his birthday party... ﻿and introduce her ﻿to his children? ﻿Don't you ﻿mess with me! ﻿I'm your father, ﻿not your son! ﻿What's her name? ﻿She must have a surname. ﻿-Muro. - ﻿What? ﻿-Ana Muro. ﻿Francisco Muro's daughter? ﻿-How should I know? ﻿How? Anyone comes here...! ﻿I don't know her father. ﻿She doesn't like him much. ﻿But she didn't come, ﻿Alejandro brought her! ﻿Well, I suppose ﻿coincidences do exist. ﻿At least he's happy, ﻿isn't he? ﻿Repulsively ﻿happy. ﻿Can I help you? ﻿-Sure. ﻿Greek baptism! ﻿Roman ﻿challenge! ﻿A toast, ﻿but in peace. ﻿You give up too quickly ﻿or a Greek. ﻿Alejandro! ﻿What else ﻿can I do for you...? ﻿I don't know ﻿what to call you. ﻿I'm sorry. I've never ﻿had to deal with a judge. ﻿I'm not here officially. ﻿Thank you for letting me in. You're doing the right thing with those criminals. I'm glad ﻿to be able to help you. ﻿Did you know your daughter ﻿was A. Macantasis' girlfriend? ﻿She wasn't ﻿his girlfriend. ﻿They took her hostage. ﻿But how can you ﻿tell your daughter... that it's not true, ﻿that it's not love... ﻿that they're ﻿using you. ﻿I tried to tell her. ﻿But women... ﻿I had everything. ﻿Now I have nothing. ﻿Thank you, Angela. ﻿The three of them killed her, ﻿didn't they? ﻿I don't know ﻿yet. ﻿lt seems ﻿unlikely. ﻿Unlikely? ﻿That those three Greeks ﻿killed my Ana? ﻿Four. ﻿That corrupted judge ﻿is as guilty as they are. ﻿I meant it's unlikely ﻿the three of them did it. ﻿What do ﻿you mean? ﻿That just one of them ﻿stabbed her so many times? ﻿The forensic doctor is certain ﻿the first stab was mortal. ﻿You say that ﻿for me to believe... that she didn't ﻿suffer so much. ﻿Thank you. ﻿That's of no use to me. ﻿Nobody dies as quickly ﻿as you would like to believe. ﻿Life, especially ﻿when it's young... resists. ﻿lt resists. ﻿He'll like the flowers. ﻿You love him, ﻿don't you? ﻿Will you marry ﻿Alejandro? ﻿Alejandro, ﻿his father... his brothers ﻿and you. ﻿I'll marry the whole family, ﻿lsabel. ﻿Nico, Dad invites us ﻿to go hunting next weekend. ﻿What're you ﻿doing? ﻿Where are you going? ﻿Back with Florencia? ﻿What for? It's no use. ﻿Don't make her suffer. ﻿lf I tell her, ﻿she won't believe me. ﻿She will ﻿believe you. ﻿Don't be ﻿a jerk. ﻿Stop packing ﻿you fool. ﻿What do you care ﻿if I go or stay? ﻿What do you care ﻿if I go or stay? ﻿Do you miss me? ﻿-Sometimes I do. ﻿lt makes me sick to be alone ﻿with those two freaks. ﻿Are you leaving ﻿because of that? ﻿I know. I shouldn't have come. ﻿Nobody's asking you ﻿to leave. - ﻿Do you like hunting? - ﻿No. ﻿Certainly ﻿not. ﻿I'm here ﻿to... ﻿I'm here ﻿to see the place. ﻿Has Alejandro ﻿arrived? ﻿Nobody ﻿has. ﻿They'll be coming ﻿with Dad. ﻿Do you like ﻿riding? ﻿I used to like horses ﻿but one threw me once. ﻿Come. ﻿You get on and off a horse ﻿on the same side. ﻿-Did you leave ﻿because of me? No. ﻿When I die, I'm going ﻿to be buried with Oscuro. ﻿Why? ﻿lt has to be ﻿that way. ﻿There's something missing ﻿without him. ﻿We're joined ﻿by what can't be tamed. ﻿Horses are more impatient ﻿than man. They're ﻿more... ﻿More ﻿passionate. ﻿His heart beats so hard. ﻿lt's always galloping. ﻿No... ﻿No, I have to leave. ﻿I can't be here. ﻿I should leave.
