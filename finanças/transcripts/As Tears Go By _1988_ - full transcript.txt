Hello, Wah? It's your auntie. What's the matter? Are you still asleep? I'll call you back, then. Okay. Hello? Wah, It's your auntie again. Are you still asleep? I'll call you back, then. Oh, forget it. Just go ahead. Your cousin's not feeling well. She's going to see a doctor. To save on travel costs... she's gonna stay with you for a few days. Okay? I have a cousin? She's your second uncle's daughter, Ngor. Who is it? I was wondering if you were here. I'm Ngor. You're my cousin, right? Make yourself at home. Kitchen and bathroom's over there. Hey. Someone's about to call me. Tell him to call me back. Hello? Hi. Can I speak to Brother Wah? He's sleeping. Who's this? Heh, I guess you don't know me. You must be his new friend. I'm 烏蠅. Who are you? (ＦＬＹ) I'm his cousin. Cousin? Er, never mind... Tell him I'm dealing with Fat Karl. Ask him to call me when he wakes up. Okay. Hello? Hi, Wah's cousin. Is Wah awake yet? Still not up. Is it serious? Do you want me to wake him up? No, it's okay. When he wakes up, tell him that I'm still dealing with Fat Karl, and tell him to call me! Okay. Go to sleep if you're tired. I could sleep in the living room tonight... Why do you wear a mask? Because I'm sick. What do you have? The doctor says I have bronchitis. He told me to see a specialist. You won't die. Just eat more oranges. you'll be alright. Weird drink. （Ｌｕｃｏｚａｄｅ） Hey, someone named Fly called you a bunch of times earlier. Oh yeah? What did he say? Hello? Hi, Wah's cousin? Is Brother Wah out of bed yet? Hello? I'm still trying to get the money off of Fat Karl. Shit, you still haven't got the money? He's just fucking with you at this point. Stay there. I'm coming right now. I can't join you for dinner tonight. Here's a hundred bucks for dinner. Key's under the carpet. Would you take that thing off? It looks stupid. Some tea, sir. Karl, you know what? I've been doing you a favour, talking to you all evening. If you didn't know me before, it's not because I'm small-time. My dai lo always told me to be subtle. Do you know Airplane, from Chiwan? He owed us $1600. He was just two days late, and now he's not flying anywhere! He's in a wheelchair! I put him in that wheelchair. You trying to scare me? Airplane's a nobody compared to me! You listen to me. I'm Fat Karl, and I don't "pay debts." One of those Big Circle assholes paid me a visit once, and now Mr. Big Circle is Mr. Little Circle! Do you know why? Because he said I owed him money, so I beat him halfway to death! He's got one eye left! And you think you can come here with two days of experience and ask me for money? I've got more knife scars than you have leg hairs. Scars? My brother's got scars! I'll cut myself if you have any! Well, then, cut yourself! Are you done talking? We're just getting started. Just getting started, all day. Do you wanna fucking die? Don't move! Nobody move! Are you gonna pay up? Are you? Yes, yes! Why wouldn't I? Unbelievable. Just like that. I know just by his face that he's a sheep in tiger's skin. With that many guys around, they would have taken you down from the start, if they had the guts. You're right. That's for you. Thanks, dai lo. Wait-- Hi. Here for Mabel? Yeah. She's not at work yet. I'll wait for her downstairs. Okay! The boutique just got the spring collection. Really? I'll go there with you one of these days! Okay! Mabel! C'mere. I haven't eaten yet. Wanna join me for dinner? It's okay if you don't want to. Why were you late for work? I was at the hospital. The hospital? Why? I had an abortion. Are you fucking with me? Pretend I'm fucking with you if you want. No, I won't. Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant? Did you even give me a chance to tell you? I waited three days for you to call me. You could have called me. Call you? What could I tell you? Tell you I was getting an abortion? Ask you to marry me? We've been together for six years! And what did I get? I feel like I don't even know you! And you've never shared any money! I'm so poor I had to borrow my mother's money for that abortion! Call you? What's the point? Shut up! You knew from the start what kind of person you were dealing with. If all you're looking for is money and matrimony, don't stick around. Don't think that just because you had an abortion without telling me that I'd feel guilty for the rest of my life. I won't! Your mouth says you won't, but your heart says you will. Because you didn't care about me, I killed your unborn child, and I'm gonna tell everyone what I did, so you will feel guilty for the rest of your life! Go ahead. Go ahead. Biu go. Are you alright? Biu go? What's the matter, biu go? Are you heartbroken? What did you say? What did you say? Don't talk about heartbreak again. Or I'll throw you out. You see the doctor? I just got back from the hospital. What did the doctor say? I get my results tomorrow. Have you eaten yet? Let's go out. I've already made something. Fly called again this morning. What did that asshole say? Nothing in particular. Just chatting. Didn't he say anything about me? Like what? Like about last night? He did ask one thing. What did he ask? I'm not sure I should say. Just tell me. Are you sure you wanna know? He asked me if you were heartbroken. You've been here all day. Why don't you go out? Nowhere to go. I have no friends in Kowloon. Finish your food. We'll go out tonight. Biu je, are you in school, or are you working? I'm working. What do you do? I work at a friend's restaurant. Is he your boyfriend? Not quite. Everyone calls him Uncle Tang. Let's go to the movies later. We'll go if you can manage. You don't have to stay with me. Ready to call for help? Site. How much have you lost? Five hundred. I won't play for that kind of money. Let's play for a thousand. How abut that? A thousand? What do you think, Snooker King? You wanna see what I'm made of for a thousand? I'll play one-handed for two thousand. One-handed? Let's go! Site. One-handed... Another one in the pocket. How are you feeling? See, the snooker king's pretty good! Site, how much am I losing by? No need to add it up. He's beating you by 30 points. He'd have 5 more points than you, even if you sink the rest of your shots. Looks great on you. That means we need a more accurate stick. Site, give me my special stick. Back up, back up. This little piggy went to the market... Excuse me. This little piggy went home... Outta the way, outta the way. This little piggy had roast beef... Heh heh. Okay, we're done with the special stick, Site. That's too easy. Let's make it harder for him. I must warn you - you're gonna lose 7 points. Make your move. Take the shot! Do you think we're fucking stupid? Dai lo! You okay? Shut up! Go away, bastard! Get back here! Come back! Outta the way, assholes! Dai lo! Dai lo! Can we go now? Sure. Shut the fuck up! Are you okay? I'm okay. Why don't you go to sleep? It's late. Biu go, the test results say I'm going to be alright. I wanted to celebrate with you, but Auntie says the weather's getting nice, and the restaurant's getting busy, so Uncle Tang wanted me back early. I've called you twice, but I haven't heard back. You must be dead tired. Summer's coming. It's tourist season on Lantau Island. Do you get to take vacations in your line of work? There's food in the kitchen. Also, I bought you a set of drinking glasses. I know they'll all end up broken sooner or later. So I've hidden one of them. One day, when you need this glass, call me, And I'll tell you where it's hidden. Bye-bye. -Ngor. Everyone! Turn it down. Turn it down! Friends, family, today is the wedding day of my sai lo, Site. We've got some finger food for you! Would we all raise a toast? Yum bui! (Cheers!) I told you two hundred dollars was too big of a gift. How was I supposed to know he was gonna have a rooftop party? Help yourself! Don't be like this. Eat something. Cheese! One more! One more! Okay, enough! Thanks! Why don't you get a picture with your in-laws? Quick! Go! Baba, can I get a picture with you? No. Please, dad? No! Don't be like that. Get a picture with him! No. What for? This is embarrassing. Finish your dinner! I'm gonna pass out if we don't leave soon. Don't be like that. If you don't have the money, don't throw a party. A rooftop party is so cheap. I just don't know with you. You never learn. You've never put your money where your mouth is. It's your sai lo's wedding! Why did you cheap out? Dai lo, don't you think I wanted a fancy party? I don't have the money! What do you want me to do? Christ. What a whiner. Homo. What did you say? What did I say? I called you a faggot! I gave you shark-fin soup and seafood, didn't I? We don't need air conditioning, either! So why are you complaining? You don't even deserve this food! If your son-in-law didn't tell me you loved shark-fin soup, I wouldn't have given you shark-fin soup! If I knew you were such a pain in the ass, I'd feed you shit, not shark-fin soup! Do you wanna fucking die? Who do you think you are, throwing food at me? Stay out of the way, I'm gonna kill him! Wanna fight? Don't do it, dai lo! Wanna fight, huh? What do you want now? Fuck off! I'm telling you. Shut up. Why do you want me to shut up? Sit down! Get lost! (Good boy!) Sit down. Sit down! Did you see that? He really is a fucking asshole. Do you really want to get in a fight in front of your dai lo? Wouldn't you do the same? Say that again! Say it one more time! That was Site's new father-in-law. You're embarrassing your sai lo. Don't you realize that? Okay. My fault! I fucked up! Sai lo, I've brought shame upon you today. One day, I'll pay you back and make it up to you. I knew it was coming, But it happened so quickly. The cops arrested some of our men last night. They're just small fry. That's not a big deal. But Bigmouth Kay handles the money. I was told that the cops are trying to reach a deal with him. They want him to turn informant. This is serious business. So the boss wanted me to let you know - if you can help it, don't stir up trouble for the next little while. Lot of police activity outside! To those of you with drugs and guns, you'd better put 'em away! Wah, someone's waiting for you outside. Thanks. What do you want? This is serious. Your sai lo, Fly, owes us money. He's missed four payments, and he's not returning our calls. My dai lo sent me to let you know if he doesn't show up tomorrow - well, that was his last chance. Tell Tony I can look after my own man. And as for that debt, I'll ask Fly. If this is for real, I'll take him to Tony tomorrow. Hey, dai lo, here to see me? You need money, don't you? I always need money. I have big ideas. A fortune teller once told me I'll be free by the time I'l 30. Everything is fine. No need to stay here. Did your fortune teller say you're not going to make it to 30? Noooo. I heard you owe Tony money. What did you say? That was English. You know I don't speak English. Seriously, though. Do you owe Tony money? Noooo. No? Then why are they looking for you? They're just down the street. Want me to tell them you're here? Sure. What are you winking at me for? How much do you owe them? How much? Not a lot. Take it easy. "Not a lot" is still something. How much? A hundred bucks. It's not a big deal. Leave him alone. But they came to me. Tell me. Dinner for four and a pair of gold bracelets for the bride. Here's eight thousand. What? Eight thousand? Is one dollar worth two today? It's eight thousand if he says it's eight thousand. Eight thousand covers the principal. What about the rest? He's missed four payments. Even after this, he still owes us thirteen thousand, five hundred. And that's going easy on you because we know you. Why don't you just steal the money? Who do you think you are, talking to me? You're a chatty one. Kwong, go keep him company over there. Yes, sir. Fuck off, asshole! Shut up! Get out of here! Leave. Your brother's lucky he works under you. If he was with anyone else, he'd be dead already. That's enough. I don't wanna talk about him. We're gonna get you the principal. But we don't have enough to pay the interest, so we have to hold this up for another two days. You want me to wait for two days? Why don't you just give it to me when I'm dead? You need to trust me on this. Even if you don't trust him. This debt is my responsibility. But I don't have the money right now. I'll get it to you in two days. How can you be a dai lo if you don't have any money on you? You may as well work on a farm. I thought you had money and that's the reason I'm even talking to you. You're a terrible dai lo. Do you really want the money? What's the matter? What? Are you crazy? I'd be happy to take it from you if you have it right now. Okay, I'm gonna make a phone call. What are you doing just standing there? Your boss asked you to keep me company! Why aren't you saying anything? What's your dad's name?! What's your mom's name?! Shut up, Fly. Why aren't you saying anything?! Do you not have parents?! Are you in charge here? Don't come near us, assholes! I have a small problem. Would you loan us some money? Would you? Yes, yes! Really? Really! No problem! Fly. Now I'm gonna borrow some money from your boss here. Up to you if you wanna take it. But the debt between us is paid. If I end up rich someday, I'll pay you back. You made a mistake, letting outsiders into your house of worship. Isn't that right? Right! What are you waiting for? Give Tony his money. We're even! And a tip. You're a real piece of work, causing trouble here. You're pretty great, yourself. Just a sec. Go. Tony, I pay you to protect this place, not let people come in here to steal from us. What do you think that means? Boss, you're just losing your temper. We've got a situation here, and you two are still fighting with each other. Don't pretend I'm not here! He was in the wrong here, borrowing money from me, causing trouble at my place, and then stealing from my boss. He was completely in the wrong, boss. You already knew he was crazy, so you shouldn't have bothered him. And you're out of line, taking advantage of him like that. You should have known he was watching over that place! Boss, I'm just paying him back... He wanted us to pay up, so I paid up. It was a fair trade! Fair?! What are you doing? Until the day I die, I'm the one calling the shots here. Pain in my ass! You two are gonna pay him on a monthly basis. We're settling it that way. Shake on it. What are you doing? I told you two to shake on it. Shake on it. Shake! Kay sold us out. He's a police informant now. We can't let him live. We need to kill him before he goes to trial. What do you think? Easier said than done. Who should we send? I don't want an outsider dealing with this. Tell you what. You two, come back in two days and find some men who wanna get paid. He's the man for the job. He's brave enough. Send your sai lo If he wants. I'll let him go. And he won't have to pay the debt he owes me. His family can take on that debt if he dies. Got what it takes? Sorry? What? Trying to scare me? Shut up. Don't insult my men. You and me are the bravest ones here. One of us can do it. I'll do it if you won't. Say the word and I'll take it. You won't do it if you don't speak up. Say you won't do it and admit you're a coward. And I'll do it. Get real. Oh, now both of you are asking me to do it? Okay! I'll kill you two first, then I'll kill him! Enough! Stop fighting. I'll figure this out. Now get out of here. Thanks, boss. Yeah, thanks, boss. Not you, Wah. Come here. I know that you and your sai lo are like brothers, but he's a loose cannon. Get him under control, because he's a ticking time bomb, and someday, he's gonna get you in serious trouble. I know. I've been thinking about it. I want to find him a job. Good idea. Yu dan! Yu-- (ＦＩＳＨ ＢＡＬＬＳ) Guess that's all for today. Cool! Brother Fly, Brother Wah's here. Uh, you deal with him. Fish balls! Fish balls for sale! Hey, dai lo! Gimme one. What do you mean? Can a man not operate a small business? Who even am I? You'll be big business one day. Yeah. I sell fish balls here today - But tomorrow, I'm gonna sell rockets to the Middle East. Cops! Get back here! The cops are coming. Who cares? Does this cart belong to you, fish ball man? What is your name, fish ball man? Pardon me? If you're not selling fish balls, then why do you have scissors in your hand? Maybe you're the fish ball man? I'm just trimming my whiskers! So it's not your cart. Take the cart away. Go ahead! Take it! Hey! What are you doing? We paid for that cart! Money doesn't matter. But pride does. I'm not famous, but people know me. I don't wanna sell fish balls! I wanna enjoy my free time! Outta the way. Move. I want you to hold a job, Fly. I don't fucking like selling fish balls! What do you want to sell? You can't just do nothing and hang around all day! You don't have any motivation! Yeah, I don't have any motivation! I just sell fish balls! You asked me to! When I can't take it anymore, I'm gonna poison those fucking fish balls! This is for your own good. Why can't you see that? Hi. This is a coincidence... Yeah, it is a coincidence. How are you? Fine. I got married. That's good. Your husband treat you well? Pretty well. Heavy rain. Wonder when it's gonna stop. I'm waiting for my husband. Smoke? I don't smoke anymore. It's not yours. Gotta go. Bye-bye! Is Ngor there? She's not here. Who's this? Nevermind. Thank you. Ma'am? Can I help you? Is Ngor here? She went to Kowloon. She hasn't come back yet. -Kowloon? -Yes. Thanks. You're welcome. How long have you been here? I just got here. You've gained weight. A little bit. So have you. Thank him. My doctor. Can you stay the night? No, I was about to head home. Ngor. I wanted to let you know - I found the glass. Ms. Cheung just called. She said she was going to the pier at Silvermine Bay, and asked if you could wait for her. You can settle in. I'll check you in tomorrow. Okay. When do you work tomorrow? Pretty early. I'll make you breakfast. Cool. How long are you gonna stay? It depends. I'm gonna head back. I'll walk you home. That's okay. It's not far. Why don't you stay here? Why did you take so long to visit me? Because I know who I am. I can't promise you anything. I wouldn't be here if I didn't miss you. If you don't plan on seeing me more often, I'm probably gonna marry that doctor. Hi, Fish ball guy. I'm gonna get a dollar's worth of fish balls with extra sauce. Take it! Why won't you take it? You said you wanted extra sauce! Take it or I'm not gonna be very happy. "Fish ball guy." Fuck off. If it isn't Mr Fly! Why are you so poor? You don't have to sell fish balls, do you? Poor guy. Must've been your dai lo who put you up to it. You should ditch him and join us. Look at my crew, all dressed to kill. And we've got cellphones too. Want one? Ham ga chan! Your dai lo's got you selling fish balls from a cart! You're better off working for me! Run! Run from what? You're a gangster! Nothing to be afraid of! We're gangsters too! Get him! Don't worry! You'll be fine even if you end up in jail. And remember, at least try to put up a fight if someone tries to kill you in there! Don't embarrass us! You fucker! Take it easy. It's fine! You're not selling drugs - just fish balls! To the movies, boys! You fucking prick! Fuck you! Come here, asshole! Get over here! Fuck you! Bring him here! Done with that drink? How many chicken wings are in these boxes? About two or three hundred a box. Two or three hundred? Hey, tell your boss... not to send you out and carry such heavy weights on your own or he's gonna meet one of my fists for each of these wings. You're crazy. I'm crazy? Do you want me to help you or not? Who cares? I'm gonna quit this job. Quit! Why? I'd like to work in Kowloon. Cool, that works for me. You can stay at my place. Don't say that again. No take-backs if you say that again. I'm not kidding. I'll leave this place and I won't come back. Hey, what do you wanna eat? Tell him I'm gonna get the money on time. If anything happens to Fly, he's gonna pay for it. That's all. What's the matter? Nothing serious. Fly's got a small problem. I gotta go. Is it gonna be dangerous? No, it's fine. I'll be back tonight. Pretty busy here tonight, Uncle Kwan. Wah. Fly fucked up. But I don't want to make a big deal out of it, since we all know each other. The matter is settled if you tell Tony what he wants to hear. Tony, no matter what Fly's done this time, I'm gonna deal with him by my rules. Please give my sai lo back. Sai lo? Which sai lo are you talking about this time? You mean that sai lo? You've got no problem protecting your sai lo - Now you're protecting your sai lo! Are you kidding me? You should protect someone who deserves it. Right now, you're protecting a lump of shit. How can you call yourself a dai lo? Tony, quit while you're ahead. Don't take this too far. Save it, Uncle Kwan! I'm teaching him a lesson. His men think they can treat me like this. What's that gonna mean in the future? Sure I'll let him go. But you have to do something for me. I'm not asking for much. Just tell me the one thing I want to hear, and I'l let him go. Is this what you wanna hear? Do you wanna keep your sai lo? Wah! Dai lo. Are you okay? Can you walk? Yes I can. Tell your men to help him up. Help him up. No, I can stand on my own. I can stand on my own. Don't come near me! Dai lo! I'm telling you - we'll never settle this, even with God himself as the judge! Fly, we're not out of the clear yet. Take this money, go back to your hometown, and wait for the heat to die down. I'm not going. I made a vow. I won't go back to my mother until I've made something of myself. Okay. We'll go to Lantau Island, then. Why do you insist on driving me away? Why? Becaue I don't want you to be killed when you leave the fucking house tomorrow! You knew he was bad news. I told you not to start anything with him. He started it! I didn't start anything! And I'm gonna get him back. I can manage it. You think so, huh? If you could go toe-to-toe with him, you face wouldn't look like a fucking watermelon right now. Yeah! he fucked my face up. But if you think I'm dragging you down, you can leave me the fuck alone! Those are his words, not mine. Don't go there without a reason. If you can make it out here alive without me - I'll call you my dai lo. Tomorrow's a new day. Right? Let's get something to eat. Come on. Get him! This is a bit of a twisted situation, eh, Fly? Did you think you were gonna get away? Don't hurt my brother! Leave him alone! Take me instead! Haven't had enough? No, I'm done with you. I want you to see how I'm gonna fuck up your brother! Shit! Show me what you're made of! I'm a fair man; an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. Don't move! The trigger's sensitive. Dunno where that gun'll go off if you move. Great! You're lucky this time. Will you be so lucky next time? You look excited! Do you wanna party too? Okay, you can join us! I wouldn't move if I were you. Maybe I'll shoot your dai lo. Or his sai lo Be strong, Fly! If I can't get out of here today, leave, go home, and don't come back here. Tough guy! But are you tougher than this bat? It's very tough. Very tough! Tough, isn't it? Isn't it? Look out, bitch! Ooh, two points! Ai ya! He's pissing himself! You should put a diaper on him before you bring him out! What kind of brother are you? Yeah! Put your head down, so you can see your face in the piss, and realize why you're such a failure. Go back to your hometown and farm with your dai lo. The city's not for you. You hear me? It's okay. It's okay. Where are you going? I'm leaving you to deal with the shame. Just pretend you don't know me. From now on, I want nothing to do with you. Just leave me alone. Fly... Biu go? Biu go! Open the door! Open up! Open up! Hurry up! Open the door! What's wrong? My cousin fell and hurt himself. He's alright. Let him sleep it off. Where were you last night? With my cousin. Keep the door locked while I'm gone. Call me if anything happens. -Excuse me. -Hi, we're waiting for someone to join us. Pardon me. Talk to each other while you're waiting! A shooting at a police station won't get the death penalty. You'll spend a few years in prison, but you'll be a man when you get out! People call you a boy now, but they'll call you Sir tomorrow. It's your chance to make us proud. Understand? Boss, I'm afraid. What? Afraid? You offered to go and now you say you're afraid? Your friends would kill for this opportunity. Don't cry about it. Go! Boss, I'm afraid. Chickenshit. Boss. I've got something to ask you. -Here's $30. Keep the change. -Thank you! Site. Dai lo? You're a different person now that you're a father. I have no choice. I have a young family. Anything for a living. Take this. What is this? I promised you. I'm sorry for last time. Go eat somewhere nice this time. And the rest of that is for your son's first birthday. Remember. Don't bring shame upon your wife's family. Understand? Where did you get this money? Don't worry about it! I won't be around. Call Brother Wah if you get in trouble. We never got to enjoy our time together I feel ashamed of myself. Don't say that, dai lo-- Listen to me! You may have resented me for what I did. And I deserve it. But in two days, when you read the paper and watch the news, you'll know I was no coward. I'm your dai lo. Tell them I was your dai lo. Tell them. Do these clothes fit you? You didn't sleep at all last night. Get some rest. I can't sleep. Don't worry. It's just a scratch. It's alright. You were lucky this time, but what about next time? I've never thought about next time. Just focused on the moment. I want you to come with me when I go back to Hong Kong. I've said it twice now. I'm not taking it back. What do you think? Come. Sit with me. Brother Wah. Brother Fly gave me a bunch of money last night. He said he was making up for last time. And he said I would know he wasn't a coward when I read the news two days from now. Brother Wah, please come back as soon as you can. If you don't come back, I don't know what he's going to do. I'm on my way. Going out again? A friend wants to see me for a while. I'm going to Silvermine Bay to get you some medicine. Want me to buy anything for you? I'll be back soon. Eighty eight. Miss Cheung called you. She wanted to let you know she didn't need the medicine Take care. See you soon. I win again! Pay up. Count it later. Why didn't you tell me you changed your address, Tony? Come on. Get up, get up, get up. Don't you know the rules here? You're not gonna let me join you? Don't lose your fucking money to me. The guilt would drive me crazy. You're already crazy! You start feeling guilty too, and your son'll be born with no ass! What's your fucking problem? What? What? Let him be the boss for two minutes. He's never been the boss of anything. Let him risk his life over that two minutes. Come on. Let's go. Another round. Don't you know the rules? Get another tile. Eight. Sorry, sorry. Come on. Let's go. Stop fucking with us! Leave him alone! Let him be a two-minute hero. You're very patient. Fuck you! You think I wouldn't fuck you up? Come and get me. If you fuck me up, I'd be happy to disappear. And you'll have to deal with Kay and his big mouth. Come on. Come on! Come on. Fuck you! Don't move or I'll shoot. Shoot me if you dare. Are you threatening me? Shoot me! Pull the trigger and shoot me! Don't shoot! No! Scared, asshole? I'll blow your fucking head off! No! Don't shoot! I wanna shoot you. But you're not worth shooting. That's the money I owe you. Take it. Take it. One chance. Take it or I'll shoot you. Don't forget to say thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. You're nobodies, even with your suits and cellphones. You're better than this dai lo. Go to hell. We're here to make money. Shouldn't I take the money if he pays me back? Here. Go dancing. Hey! Don't treat a dai lo like that! I just went to the store, mom. Are you gonna come see me? What's going on? Nothing much. I know you can't stand the heat, so I bought you an air conditioner. Oh, you can keep that one. We've got one here now. I can't meet with you. Your father is here. He's your husband. Not my father. When will you calm down and stop disappearing? Why did you come out here to see me? Why don't you just leave me alone? Who's gonna keep you in check if I don't? Don't act like this is gonna make you famous. People are gonna call you brave that evening. But no one will remember you next week. What's gonna happen after? No one will even recognize you! I've done bad things for the boss. I was a paid killer by the time I was 14. Makes me a big man, right? Look at me. I'm just an ordinary man. You achieved something once! But what about me? What about me?! No one cares about me, and you turn a blind eye. People always look down upon me. They've even said I was a dog beneath your ass. Did you know that? I would rather be a hero for a day, than a fly for the rest of my life! Would you let me accomplish something noteworthy for once in my life? Just this once! Okay. Are you going? I'll go with you if you want. I'll avenge you if you're taken down. Don't do this to me! I can't repay you. I don't have much else to say. Say the word, and I'll go with you. We'll go to Lantau Island if you change your mind. I'll deal with the consequences. Okay. Okay. I'll go with you. Doggie, doggie. Don't be scared of him! He was once a big shot, sure, but those days are over! Don't be selfish. Give some to the dog.
