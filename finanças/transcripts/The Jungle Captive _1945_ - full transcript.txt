Ah, my dear Ann, so glad to see you again after all these minutes. 20 of them at least. 50 minutes, Johnny. = 50 minutes! 50 years away from you, Ann. You're not flattering me, Johnny. Now what have you been doing? Waiting for the specimen of Dr. Lee's. I could check with Dr. Lee's office nurse, you know. But I'll let it go at that. Aw gee, thanks, Ann. Dr. Lee would like to have the report as quickly as possible. =t don't think we can run another test this afternoon, Johnny. Oh, that's okay with me. But if the boss wouldn't spend so much time experimenting with those rabbits, he'd get done with... That's Mr. stendahl"s business, Johnny. And if you wouldn't spend so much time running errands. Deliver this to Dr. Jackson. Okay, Ann. Coagulation test for Dr. Lee. = sh. = another blood donor? Yes, the transfusion's just been completed. How is the experiment progressing this time? Mr. stendahl will know in just a minute. Well, Ann, there is a chance this time the electric needle accomplishing its purpose. Oh, I hope so, Mr. stendahl. But I can hardly believe that rabbit's been dead for 12 hours. I know, and yet the electric current, plus transfusions has revived the heart so that it is functioning. There's the proof. Now everything depends upon what happens when the heart is no longer stimulated by electricity. If the heart stops beating when the current is switched off, can you resume the process? = no. There's only one chance and this is it. All right, Don. Well, start putting the equipment away. = Ann! Mr. stendahl! Look! = it was dead. Now it lives! We've made a successful beginning at last. That's wonderful, Mr. stendahl. Did you say something about a coagulation test, Ann? Yes, Mr. stendahl, but I can run it. And I'll watch the rabbit, sir. Thank you, Don. Thank you, Ann. Maybe I would like to relax a little while. What do you want? I've come for the body. What body? Here. = oh. The ape woman, huh? City medical college wants her now instead of in the morning. City college. Fine time of the night to come for this one. But you're welcome to her. Glad to get rid of that animal. Wait a minute, I gotta check with the police first. - Police? - Yes, the law. What gets me is, why move that stiff at this hour? We're scheduled to be taken to the city medical college in the morning. Mm-hmm. But this is the time we generally move 'em, ain't it? Yeah, in, not out. Mm-hmm. Hey, anybody here? Are you kidding? I wonder where Fred is. = can't be far. Looks like he's just been eating. Keep your eyes straight ahead! Oh, yeah, what gives. Shut up, get over in that closet! Hey, let me out of here! - Let me out! - Let me out! Let me out of here! Come on, let us out! Open it up! Open the door, come on, let us out! Hey you! - Come on! Let us out of here! Let us out, come on, let us out! Let us out of here, let us out! Open it up! Fred! Hey, Fred! Hey, let us out of here! = let us out! Let us out! - Open it up! Open the door, come on, let us out. Well, what do you know. How did you two guys get in there? Where's Fred? = that's what we'd like to know. Some guy locked us in there. Hey, you better go outside and see if our wagon's still there. I don't get it. I went out to eat and Fred stayed here. Maybe you was lucky. = get down! So, you're afraid of her, huh? You say, you didn't see the man who held you up? Okay, you think you could recognize his voice? Oh, I think maybe I could. Huh, if I ever heard it again, I'd remember it. Get that, will ya? Right. Well, whoever the man was, he came here for something. There's only one thing you can take out of a morgue. It's for you, Harrigan. = thanks. Harrigan, homicide squad. Huh? Where? Oh, yeah, I get it. Yeah, thanks a lot. That oughta help. Your dead wagon crashed and burned on the Ridge fort highway, I always liked that old bus. Me too. Maybe this is the answer to what this is all about. Where are you keeping the ape woman? Over here, you want to see her? = yeah. Fred used to say I'd wind up in one of those things. But you can't figure about death, even when it's murder. Fred, it's Fred! What's he doing in there? Obvious, isn't it? Blood count, coagulation, sputum and acetone level. Four more. I won't get around to those tests til later. I've gotta finish these slides and deliver them to Dr. Jackson immediately. Dreaming again? Mm-hmm. Same old dream, 'bout when you finished medical school. It's only one more year. Plus two years internship. Sometimes those three years seem endless. = t know. It's really tough when a guy can't even afford to buy his best girl an engagement ring. If she wanted one. Darling, you know I do. Well, why didn't you say so? = did I have to? = look. Do you suppose you could make my fraternity pin do in place of a ring for a little while? Darling, it's a beautiful pin. Okay. Consider yourself engaged. Yes, sir. Anything else? Oh, yes. Gee, you think of everything, don't ya? Only the important things, darling. Is this strictly in the interest of science? I'm sorry to break this up. I'm Harrigan from headquarters. Oh, another one of those tests from the police department. We haven't had one here in a long while. No, just some information. Are you stendahl? No, I'm Don young, one of his assistants. And this is miss forrester, another. Glad to meet you. How do you do. I'm working on a case and I thought maybe you lab people could tell me what this is. It's a surgical smock. Oh, is that what you call it. Yes, surgical smock. Say, would you mind trying this on? I'd like to get an idea the size of the man who was wearing this. Certainly. A little bit chewed up, isn't it? Yes, it is. = not a bad fit. No, it could have been worn by a man about your size. You don't suspect me, do you? Oh no, if I did I'd ask you a lot of routine questions like, where were you last night? Well, I was here at the lab til about eight and then... Don and I were together all evening. Yes, we're engaged. Oh, I see. Well, if I suspected you, miss forrester, I'd ask you where you lived? Well, that's easy, 1021 east grove street. And you, Mr. young? = 381 beacon street. What's this all about? Not a thing. I just wanted to find out where to send the wedding present. Now, I'll take that smock if you don't mind. And thanks a lot for the information. You two can pick up where I so rudely interrupted. Well, I wonder what that was all about? = Don? You didn't do it, did you? Yes, I did. And I'm gonna do it again. Well, I better get those slides over to Dr. Jackson. I won't get back by closing time as it is. Grab them for me, will ya? Mm-hmm. I couldn't be sure of the fit, but the laundry marks checked. Here he comes now, get a good look at him. Tail him, George. Right. Yeah, hello, Ann. Hello, Mr. stendahl. = where's Don? He's out delivering slides to Dr. Jackson. Oh, well then you'll have to come with me. I have an emergency for Dr. kellogg. = Mr. stendahl? Mm-hmm? = t have some news. News? Don and I, we're engaged. Well, congratulations, Ann. Thank you. I was wondering when that was gonna happen. I'll be with you in a minute. Mr. stendahl, did you see this in the paper about that ape woman? Yes, strange isn't it? What would anybody want with it? And to commit murder for it. Well, we better be going. Mr. stendahl, I'd like to make a telephone call. I'll only be a minute. I'll wait for you in the car. Hello, mother? This is Ann. Listen carefully now. If the police ask you where Don and I were last night, tell them you were with us until after one o'clock. No, I can't explain now. But please, mother, be sure and tell them just what I said. Goodbye. I'm sorry I detained you. That's all right, Ann. It's a long drive out there. Started so late, be dark before we arrive. Will we be gone that long? Mm-hmm. Is there a phone there? Probably. Don? Well, I told him I'd wait. He has enough to worry him as it is. Don, worried? What about? Did you read about that clue to the murderer who stole the ape woman's corpse? = clue? Oh, the surgical smock you mean? Yes, just before you returned to the office a detective was there. = detective? Yes, he had that smock with him and he got Don to try it on. Nothing unusual about that. They probably checked a number of places using surgical smocks. I know, but he wanted to know what we were doing last night and where we lived. I think he suspects Don. Oh, don't be silly, Ann. How could Don possibly be implicated in a thing like that? Quiet! Get back! He seems to know you. My affection for dogs, they understand that. Hello, moloch. Ann, this is moloch, the caretaker. How do you do? This way. Oh, moloch? How's the patient? She's all right. She's in the other room. = good. Is Dr. kellogg here. Oh, no. Unfortunately, he's tied up in a meeting. Take off your coat, Ann. Come in, Ann. Come here, Ann. Quite harmless. Nothing to be afraid of. You. T can't believe it. Moloch, you clumsy fool, they found that surgical smock and traced it straight to my laboratory. Her body's been well preserved. They say she had the strength of a gorilla. = it isn't human. Precisely. This is a manmade creation, an experiment. That's why I had to have the body to prove or disprove my theory of restoring life. After all, I'm not experimenting with a human being. This is an animal, we should recognize it as such. But you committed a murder to get it. Oh, yes. You see, moloch is a true scientist. He understands the unimportance of a mere life when it might impede progress. = t can't understand how I could have been so wrong about you. All the time Don and I worked for you, we both looked up to you as a great man. I sincerely hope to vindicate that judgment. I want to take an experiment here that no one has ever dared to try before. Why did you bring me out here? I told you, to help me. Certainly you don't think I'm gonna have anything to do with that? Yes. Well, I'm not. Now, please let me out of here. Ann, I need you. What do you mean? I need your blood. Oh, no, no! Oh no! Oh no! Why? Her heart's beginning to feel the strain. You gonna take much more? About another pint, if her heart will stand it. Not worried about her, are you moloch? If you take out too much blood, she'll die. Oh, moloch, I believe you feel sorry for my pretty assistant. Don't be a fool! We're scientists, not sentimentalists. No offense, moloch, but with that face, you're not exactly a Casanova, you know. This is more in your line, moloch. If I can succeed in bringing her back to life. Stimulated by the electricity, the heart's been beating regularly for about two hours. It's now or never, moloch. All right, take off the oxygen tent. She's alive! = this is what I've dreamed of. Now let the doctors laugh at my theories. Here's the proof. Yes, we must let her rest and breathe and live. Ann. Ann, we did it, she's alive. Please let me go. You'll be all right, now, Ann. There's nothing to worry about. Here. It'll help you get your strength back. Ann will be all right, now. Well, moloch, all this only proves half the theory. What's half a theory. Well, so far we've brought life back to this hybrid. If she can be transformed into a woman, then I'd have brought back life to a human. Then why don't you do it? Isn't as simple as all that. The method for that transformation has taken years of research. And I don't have the records. If I could only get them. Of course, I know they're in Dr. Fletcher's office. But she didn't come home at all last night. She didn't even phone her mother. I'm sure she's all right, Don. = where could she be? She's never done anything like this before. Well, perhaps she stayed overnight with some friends. No, I checked with everybody we know. Didn't she say anything to you last night? Hope I'm not busting in on some vital experiment. No, come in. Thanks. He a friend of yours, Don? Oh, this is Mr. Harrigan from police headquarters. Oh, how do you do? You stendahl? Yes, I'm glad to meet you. = mutual. = miss forrester here? No, she isn't. We were just talking about her. She didn't come home last night. Her mother was... Yes, I know, her mother telephoned headquarters. That's why I'm here. Where were you last night? I was out looking for her. Her mother phoned me. She was very worried about Ann. Must have been out pretty late. I was, why? One of my men called on you. Oh, about the smock business? Oh, it's just routine checking. Surely you don't suspect my assistant of being involved in anything... Stealing a body from the morgue? You'd be amazed how suspicious we police get. By the way, young man, speaking of the morgue. Why would your fiancee ask her mother to lie for her. What do you mean, lie? Well, Mrs. forrester says that her daughter told her to tell the police that you were both with her until late the night of the morgue incident. Ann said that? Yeah, obviously preparing an alibi. Why should she want an alibi? That's what I'm going to find out. Does that boy sound like the one you heard in the morgue? I don't know, could have been, but I'm not sure. Are you talking about my voice? = yeah. How about it, Jim? No, I couldn't swear to it either. Okay, fellas, thanks a lot for coming over. Say, what's this all about? Do I look like a killer? = you don't have to look like one to kill. You're wasting your time, Harrigan. Don has been my assistant for several years and I assure you that his character is unimpeachable. Yeah, what about the disappearance of his fiancee? You any theory about that? Well, yes. Could possibly be amnesia. Amnesia, I don't believe it. Well, Don, Ann has been working awfully hard lately. I myself am to blame for that. It was very thoughtless of me. Well, you'd know more about that than I. I hope he's wrong, kid. Thanks for your cooperation. Goodbye, Mr. Harrigan. Oh, I'll be seeing you. I've got to find Ann, sir. Something must have happened to her. I'm sure she's all right, Don. But you said it might be amnesia. Oh, well, that was just a wild guess to appease our detective friend. If you don't need me, sir, I'd... I know, I know. You want to go out and look for Ann, huh? Go right ahead, Don. = thanks. Why do you always find it necessary to kill every time I send you for something? Well, he come in and switched on the lights. Oh, I see. You certainly turned that office into a shambles. I done it right, huh? You, yes, moloch, you did very well. All right, bring Ann in. You want the ape woman, too? Not yet, leave her upstairs for a while. There must be something wrong. She killed him! I need some more of your blood, Ann. Not much this time. Just enough to get from it the glandular secretions that Dr. Walters used in transforming the ape woman into Paula dupree. How is she? Weak, that's all. You don't have to worry about her, moloch. Stendahl, look! What is it? Her hand! The transformation is taking place. Dr. Walters' data is correct. I, myself, proved that I can restore life. But now I can change that life from one form into another. Take off the oxygen tank. So this is Dr. Walters' creation. Paula dupree. Paula? Paula dupree? Do you understand me? Paula! Her brain. The only brain she ever had was subnormal. In some ways subhuman. Come, Paula. You stay out here, moloch. She must have absolute quiet. The slightest shock might prove very harmful. Paula? What's your name? Paula? Are you hungry? What's your name? Paula? Moloch! What are you doing with that needle. Look at the meter, she's dying. And you thought you'd bring her back to life, you crazy fool. You'd have killed her. = then she's dead? She's all right now? You ain't gonna hurt her no more? No, moloch, we must make sure that nothing happens to her. I have a new problem now. Possibly I can solve it. I shall try. Ann will help me. Paula's brain is gone. Her reactions are those of an animal. = ain't that what Paula is? Practically. Dr. Walters succeeded in transferring the brain of his nurse into Paul dupree. You're gonna put in a new brain? Yes, don't worry about miss forrester. We're going to take good care of her. = just don't hurt her no more. Certainly not, moloch. We'll take very good care of her. I just can't understand it. Maybe Mr. stendahl is right. Maybe it is amnesia. Take it easy, kid. We'll find her. I can't believe that anything's really happened to her. That's right, don't let your imagination run away with you. This stendahl, you think a lot of him, don't you? Yeah, he's been wonderful to me and to Ann. He's a great man. You mentioned some experiments that he'd been working on. Just exactly what are they? Well, he's developed a theory of resuscitation and it works. = oh. How? By electrical impulse. You mean, restoring life to a dead body? Yes, he's been at it for years. It's quite a trick if he can do it. What does he experiment on? Oh, Guinea pigs, rabbits, monkeys. Just the other day he brought a rabbit back to life. No kidding! 1 see. Well, I've got to be going. I wish you'd let me know the minute you hear anything about Ann? I certainly will. See you later. Oh, hello Harrigan. How are you, stendahl? Very well, thank you. Any word about miss forrester? Not yet. But I think we'll find her before long. I certainly hope so. Been busy lately? Yes, yes, they keep us biochemists on the run. I guess they do. I'll be seeing you. Well, drop in anytime. Thank you, I will. Well, I had hoped we might have heard something by this time. Not even a lead to go on. = too bad. Oh, Don. Did you start that test for Dr. Allen? I'll get on it right away, sir. Thank you. Work is an excellent antidote for anxiety. Yes, I guess you're right, sir. Shut up, Jake! Quiet! Who are you? What do you want? Never mind that, where's stendahl? = he isn't here. Well, I gotta see him right away. If you care to leave your name, I'll... Never mind my name, I gotta see stendahl. Are you a friend of his? Ain't none of your business. Where is he? = t don't know. Why didn't you say so! Where have you been? I went in to get you. That ape woman's gone. = t know she is. Didn't I tell you to watch her? Yeah, but she got away. Where did you go? Your place in the city. Oh, you fool! Say, doc, I ain't sure, but I think somebody tailed me all the way out here. What makes you think so? I seen lights back of me all the way. Good evening, Don. Mr. stendahl! I hardly expected to see you here. = what is this? What are you doing here? Let go of me! Moloch is my assistant, Don. Yeah, well, tell him to take his hands off me. All right, moloch! What I want to know is where'd he get my fraternity pin? I gave it to Ann. Oh, I see. Well, gentlemen, shall we go inside. I'm performing a little experiment. As long as you're here, you might be interested in seeing it. I call this my country laboratory. = Ann! What are you doing to her? I told you, I'm performing an experiment. Ann has been most helpful. If you hurt her, I'll... Nobody ain't gonna hurt her. You seem to be jumping to conclusions. Why have you got her strapped... Moloch, tie him to that chair! We thought you were such a great man. Such a wonderful man. I regret that I must destroy that illusion. = t know. What do a couple of lives mean when it might impede scientific progress. Is that it, stendahl? I see that I've taught you well. Moloch, see if you can find Paula. Release the dog, it might help you. I'll be with you in a minute. Paula, that ape woman? Yes, I brought her back to life, Don. Now I'm going beyond that, beyond what Dr. Walters and Dr. Fletcher accomplished with her. Her brain was destroyed. I'm going to give her a new brain. You mean Ann? Yes, you can't operate, you're not a surgeon... Don, you always said that I was better than any surgeon alive. But, but, you can't experiment! You can't operate, not on Ann! This is, this is... = this is science! Operations are impersonal, Don. Ann, he must be insane. I. We're gonna get out of here, darling. Believe that and hang on! = Paula! Maybe the dog will find her. Perhaps, if she hasn't gotten too far away. Paula! = listen! There's the dog. Yes, come on. Get back, Jayden. Paula. = I'll hit her back... No, moloch! Any shock might undo everything I've accomplished. Paula, we're going back. Do you understand? Paula, we're going back to the house. You're all right, Ann. Oh, Don. Can you walk? I'll try. Get away! Take her into the house, moloch. Did you find anything interesting? = just the usual lab stuff. How do you figure stendahl in this? = just a hunch. What about this fella, Don young? = he's in the clear. I've just been using him to... Old orchard road. That's out off the Ridge fort highway, isn't it? I think so, why? Here's a light and power bill paid by stendahl. 413 old orchard road. That ambulance burned up out in that district. Yeah. I think we're about ready. What are you gonna do? Perform a very interesting experiment. He's gonna take out her brain, don't you understand? He'll kill her. = no. Our friend is a little hysterical. He's gonna kill her! You've gotta stop him. You ain't gonna do that. You told me. Shut up, moloch, and get out of here. = no! You ain't gonna hurt her. Keep away from here, moloch. Stay where you are, I tell you! Fool. = Ann! = no. Take it easy, kid. Who got stendahl? = she did. Good, that'll save the state a little money. Kind of rough going for a while, wasn't it? = yeah. Darling. This is really getting married in the rough. No engagement ring. No honeymoon. = t don't mind. Is he after us? = not at 15 miles an hour. Are you Don young? Yes, sir. What's this for? Don't know, Harrigan's orders.
