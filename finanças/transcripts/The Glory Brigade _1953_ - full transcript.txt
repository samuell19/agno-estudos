YOUR FEATURES ARE GREAT FOR YOUR HEALTH 1st COMPLEX OF THE 1ST ENGINE MACHINE - Stop, call the Command. - Indeed, "boss". - 1st Lodge, invites Praiar. - Nurse! The North Koreans do not mark so good today. They still do not succeed this bridge. Lieutenant Prairie is calling. Al, here Sam. The 5th Squadron, just retreated, passing the river according to the plan. Welcome. Was it easy? And suspicious. The Reds have everything in front of the bridge. I have the feeling they want to use it yourself. - What do you say we blow it up? - Have you installed the explosives? No, but I'll do it until you get it the approval of the Division. - Well, I'll call you again. - Okay. One day they want it, you blow up the next one. Do you know what steel is that? It's American steel. The way the Army wasting money ... You think we taxpayers we have to spend. Stepney, tell Booman to take a while dynamite and meet me on the bridge. - Have you called the Destroyer? The disaster specialist, Bowman. Hudson! ... Sam and Bounten are out there. - John, where's the lie? - I had other projectiles. Okay, we brought back work again. Yes Sir. Perfect synchronization, "boss". The Division says okay. - Ready for firing! - Ready for firing! Ready for firing! - Ready for firing! - Ready for firing! Ready for firing! A D E A N M E N TABLE OF CONTENTS The estimate is expressed in the Ministry of Defense in the GER and the Engineer, ... for their cooperation in the production of this film. Chuck, men eat and rest. -I'll get the information from Davis. - All right, "boss". Indeed, Lieutenant. Yes, sir, I understand. Exactly, sir. I have it ... I have it. Indeed, sir, this minefield was cleaned at 16:00. You can use the area whenever you want. Yes, sir, absolutely. Major Colonel ... Yes Sir. Yes sir. I understand you, Major Peterson. Yes, sir, we can rebuild the bridge in 6 hours, if necessary. Do you want more information? I will use 1st Logos. Head of Lord Davis, that's right, sir. Yes Sir. I realize its importance. Right, sir. I do not see why he wants to ... Fres, he kept all the phone calls. This your bridge, has created many issues, Lieutenant. The first is that it brought the 2nd Office here. - Captain, the Lieutenant Prairie. - Hello. No one saw what you understood, but the ones your information has complicated issues. We are planning a major attack in the area where the bridge was located. The Reds are trying to make us to think that they want it for them. Sounds so simple. But if they really mean it any way patrol we send from here ... ... they encounter no resistance until they arrive here ... ... and fall into a fire wall? Communists conceal something. And our Recognition he can not find it. Our attack will begin in 72 hours and we need to know what it is. Small patrols can not to do so, so ... ... the Division sends a Greek Lodge infantry for aggressive identification. And of course the Engineer will pass them across. Keep going, Hal. The second squad will depart at 19:00 and makes contact with the 1st Greek Brigade, - ... which just moved here. - You said, the 2nd squad? Yes why; Nothing, just ... I think my men will not be much if they learn that they will be with the Greeks. No one's waiting to highlight, Jörgensen. All you have to do is to cross the Greeks across, ... to wait for them and to bring them back. Leaders think it's just in front of their limb. They are trained in the guerrilla. You may learn something from them. I do not have anything against them, sir. Just, let's ... I can stay with you, Hal. Glad to change with Jörgensen. - I'm not asking anyone to change. - Calm down, calm down, I ask. Some of my best friends, they are Greeks, like my father. - You know that. - Of course I know, Sam, but ... ... we imagined we would be resting after all that you have passed today. We'll relax when we get back. Who knows; Maybe I'm with my cousins. Okay, Sam. Your mission is. - Something else, Major? - No. We're done. Oh, Prayor! Stay a little, please. Serve a cup of coffee and put me one. Someone scented it with a piece tire but it is awful. Sit down, Prayor. Where is sugar? Every time I rejoin it the hut, I can not find the sugar. I have come in and out so many times which I feel like yo-yo. Thanks. I asked you to stay, Poirot, because the attitude Jorgenson is worrying me. I'm afraid that many men they share it. Perhaps not so many, who you think, sir. Or more. Have you ever met soldiers, I do not care what nationality, ...that they like to co-operate with strangers? Especially under a foreign administration? If you talk about my men, sir, we are together too long. I know each one separately. And they know me. They still know that my name was Privolvo. All right, Pr. Giving personal advice to the Army it is the same ugly when you are a volunteer. We are both crazy. Good luck. Thanks. - How did it go; - Get the kids, please. 1st Squadron ... come here. Well... You cheated that he is a UN war. Where are our allies? Well, tonight you'll have the chance to see some. Sending a pass with the 1st Greek Brigade. Being in a posting, we will be under Greek administration. Some difference from the governor what do we have now, sir? Try to scare us, Lieutenant? Something else. I... I volunteered to you, guys. I thought you would like to know some genuine Greeks ... ... instead of a blaster like me. Too bad we'll get through them. I wanted to see them in action. Now... Does anyone want to stay behind? I get your vote of confidence with the spirit you gave it. Will there be trouble, boss? I will show them the horror of Texas. I think you will find them very tough. They have been guerrilla since then that Socrates was a baby. In fact, they are very awesome. All right, finish your food. We depart at 19:00. Terrible warriors! Good! Never born a soldier and be smart? Smile for the bird, Sam. The reception committee is coming. - Lieutenant Lecturer, Engineer. - Captain Haros. - Captain. - Lieutenant Lieutenant. - Lieutenant. - Lieutenant ... Dean Marakis. -To translate when necessary. - Decaune. Graduate of the American School in Athens. I welcome the Americans. They are my friends. Hold on, boss. I mean, Privolo. The Captain wants us to know that he and his men ... ... are eager to do night missions. Luz is lucky. We are looking forward just come back from a mission. And I never saw dancing ours before the action. The Greek poet Palamas says the people walks through history through dance. It is also said that sometimes he likes to fight. Mr. Cox believes that little cognac before the fight makes the blood boil. She's waiting to welcome you and your officers. - Cognac? - You said they were wonderful people. As he used to do my grandfather. And now... Good luck, gentlemen. Thank you, sir. I know we came here for crossing the river. When will they get to the point these "fruits"? Now, Sergeant, we'll see what they have to say the "fruit" for crossing the river. Sorry, sir. I forgot that you speak our language. In the present time, the whole world speaks your language. I've worked out the details. You will be in charge of the business in the river. When we get to a point somewhere on this bay ... ... you will choose the most likely shore for disembarkation ... clear? - I know the area very well, Captain. - Welcome. We spent a life there, Few days ago. As soon as we disembark, I will take over. We will keep absolute radio silence. Except to pass on any information we learn behind their fire dam. - It's clear; - Clear. I do not expect any difficulty. You will stay on the opposite, in close proximity. I will move towards my goal. I'll open a pass ... ... I will see with my eyes what it is hiding the enemy and I will return. - Then you'll be back to dawn. - Maybe earlier. Suppose they will meet problem opening the passage? What will happen to us? Captain said if he did not come back in the river at a reasonable time ... ... let some boats and leave. We will be ready in the river, Captain, in 45 minutes. Now, with your permission. You have to understand them. That's all. They have never been defeated. At least from a country of their size. The ancient Greek warriors were very great. Yes, and do not hesitate to remind you, is not it? My father is like that. Makes 2 continuous streaks ... ... and you think he invented the game. Hey, Taylor, take a look. My wife would fool me with it. How much do you want; Well, American money. He said he would give you. But it is bad luck if you do not give something. He only wants a pen. Thank you, "jerk". Shrapnel holes. When the truck touched that mine. - How many boats were in that truck? - Four. We mixed them with the others when we switched the dump truck. If they all have such holes they will not we have trouble picking them up. Hey, boss! One more. Recheck each boat. Leave them idle here ... ... and we will "get" it off with what we have. Make it fast. Translate subtitles to listening Nikodimos Sentinel Unhappiness, boss. All four boats are pieces. This leaves us with 14 boats to we pass almost 200 men across. Wonderful! Children! Finish, please! Let us pray to the Lord! To fight at our side. He smothered our enemies with the power of justice. Show mercy, my God! Let us pray to the Lord for the fertility of fruitful land. And for the time of the forthcoming peace. Show mercy, my God! Wait! Look, Sam ... We're already almost complete, without soldiers. OK then. Remove the machine guns and the mounds. We will get what we can to carry with our hands. Then we will almost unprotected. Take a light machine gun. Hide the rest. You do not have to worry, my friend. You are under Greek protection. You heard him say. At 1-2 guards for them ... let's get started. Take out the baskets, hammers and machine guns. - Where are you going with this? - Sam said what you can carry. - You heard him too. - He did not mean explosives, get rid of them. As Aunt Suzy says, it is a condoms to make sure something is wrong. If we do not have other formalities, boss, we're ready to leave. Okay. We will be fortified here. Put them on your men make trenches. Regional defense. Good luck. I wish we were with you. You will be behind us. It is not better. - Decaune, find a hole to get in. - Yes Sir. A nice way to fight. The Greeks armed up to the teeth between us and the Communists. You know, Smith ... I bet that these Greeks they know how to fight. I bet he's up there, making the lives of the Communists difficult. Chopto, Bowman. - You know, I used to work ... - Cut it! - Somebody's over there. - Get ready! Tell everyone. - How bad; - 1-2 injured, but it will be ok. - A dead man. - Who? Hendley. Smithy! Take somebody with you and Detect the forest. I want to know what's going on. A moment. You better get Marraki with you. Do you need an interpreter? Whatever you say, boss. - Crawl around. - Welcome. Marakis, detector patrol. I do not understand. Something is wrong. - Maybe we have to come back. - You read my mind. Taylor, you and he are returning. I'll see if I can find out what happened. - Yes but... - Go, you and Marrakesh, go. I am, Taylor. - What's up; - Looks like we're trapped. The only Greeks we saw they had their hands high. - Where's Smith? - He stayed there. Reinforced as teeth? It was from the beginning. These Greeks are awful. Okay then, we have allies. I will tell you what I will do. No one will die, absolutely no one. The Greeks took the war. All we have to do is to take them and bring them. Not bad at all. Everyone happy? Taylor, Marais, come here. - Where's Smith? - Still looking around. - How many Greeks did you see? - About a dozen. They had their hands high. - No corpses, no traces of battle? - Maybe there was someone in front of us. That's why Smithy stayed. But I do not think so. - The shootings were few. - Let 's get out of here. Captain Haros said we can to do at will. What do you think; I wish we had our heavy weapons here. But so, the only logic tells us to leave. You will definitely leave. But it will be a round trip. Johnson, you will pass across and you will carry heavy weapons quickly. If they have a problem, we will go and we will support them. Jack, you, Stanny and Bowman you will stay here with me. The rest of the squad and the wounded they will come with you. Just cross over, the wounded they can walk by walking. Get started! Maraki, stay here. Maybe I need you. Yes Sir. Okay, Sam. Once you want it, it will be. Stand up, we leave. Boomman, you and Stepney you will stay here. It will dawn soon. Our platoon must where to come back. They should have already returned. Go back to the river. The whole squad, Sam. The whole platoon! Captain Haros is with them? Only 23 in this group, sir. They were cut off and attacked by the enemy. They have not seen their Captain. It was bad, Lieutenant ... He had to fight hard to get through. We came here hoping to find them all. I am very sorry about this. Truth; This weapon has not thrown. What did you fight, Lieutenant? With slings? But she has no blood on her, my dear compatriots. Like this, for example. This is not the scarf of Johnson? He's the guy who gave it initially to Johnson. I do not think he knew from the outset that Johnny would be killed, to get it back. We arranged everything. This is the last one. The Communists took the rest. Ours did not know what hit them. They knew. And they fought. And I got involved in it. If we crossed the Americans into the river Sam and encountered problems. We wish our men to support them, is not it? Is not that so, Sam? If they were our men they would not have made a mistake. It should not to be here from the beginning. It's something now that will accompany you. Rather to make sure that no one survived us. Boss, I and Chuck can to arrange this chariot if you want. It would give me the biggest pleasure to accompany them. Right, we can easily arrange it for us. Why alone? Nobody saw me surrender. Of course, he is partly Greek. You do not have to see us if we are left unseen. If you fail to destroy it, Leader Leader ... ... will not fail to find the rest of us. All right, guys. Let's start. You can help remaining unseemly. Let's close them in. You certainly did not in the easy way. I rose from their blind spot. We could achieve them when they were going out of the window. And to waste so much ammunition? Where did you say? your men? - On boats, of course. - Call them back. We will not need the boats, not yet. We're going inside. Bring those ammunition that we left behind. They sent us here Lieutenant, to we find what the Communists are hiding. - And that's what we're gonna do. - That's the job of Captain Haru. Think, Lieutenant. From what I saw is 20: 1 ... ... how you see the dead or prisoners. You suggest a handful of us to do what a Lodge did not do. All right, Lieutenant. Row or swim. I hope you do not meet Communists as you return. What if? Read it. What does the band say? - Made in the Wilmington plant. - USA We will do it your way or we will not get enough ammunition. This is; As you would say, you have the ball and the bat. And the game, that's why never forget this. The men here in Korea are working 10 times more than the others. I congratulate you on how easy it is you have solved the problem of administration. Share things and go! Wait here. Chuck! Let's go see because they were so upset. Do you know? It is not the "hangout" of the 2nd Lodge. Of course, this is the bulldozer of Pete Olson. You see the Flag of the Confederation? The 2nd Lodge had a long time to trap them. Chuck ... Go get the platoon. Get the Greeks here and tell them to make peace. You do not have to worry anymore for ammunition, Lieutenant. These boxes are full. We go back to work. Machine gun. I think it's very risky. I thought you would. You're the head. I will make an effort. I can send 1-2 of my men to strike it from within. I will handle it. You and your men, stay here. When you hear a grenade explosion, come quickly, we will surprise them. They are New Zealanders, part of our lost patrols. Chuck ... Bring Stony and Bowman and collect and others ... I want to talk to them. When you assemble them all Sam wants to talk to us. Repeat children, clean them always so fast? Always, it is a national feature. - Especially out there, Sergeant. - And you use them equally well. Words can not say how happy we are. But you think that we are unworthy. Excellent translator Marrakis, right? He may still explain and what has not been said. It's even harder to explain because 2 of my men are dead. And they were badly injured. These boxes are full with ammunition. And we need them. But watch out for traps. If you have any doubt about something, call one of the Engineer. He translated that too. Chuck, watch them. Boomman, come with me to check the hut. - We'll leave in 2 hours. - And my wounded? We will hide them in the woods with the doctor. When we find what we are looking for we will get them. Lieutenant ... Lieutenant, it does not seem to understand that ... ... we are in the middle the communist sector. And you demand to move away even farther from security. In my book, Lieutenant, that's it a good explanation of our work. Heroism like yours is very inspiring. Eventually, maybe I have a lot to learn under your command. Maybe. - Did you find anything; - Nothing here. Be careful! You thought he could to be trapped? - Of course. - Okay. I will not leave something trapped to stop smoking, go back. - Let me do it, boss. - It does not matter, I can do it. I'm not addicted, my friend. If it is trapped, I can and without it. I can without many things. Better get back. You see; It was not a trap eventually. Deacon, leave us alone. You had to neutralize it, is not that right; - What did you say; - You had to act in front of Decaune. - As you generally act so far. - Yeah? Gripping a grenade in the chariot window. By neutralizing the machine gun yourself and then here. - Very risky risk, Pr. - But much needed risk, Lieutenant. You can not accept it what happened to your platoon. A tragic but inevitable one crash of war. What does it have to do my platoon with that? As a Greek-American accused us for her loss and your self ... ... because you believed in us. Now because of your Greek blood, you have to prove to everyone that you are the brightest man in the world. You might expect me to be excited with the Greek national anthem. I do not expect anything. The bottom line is that, in fact you did not believe in us. And if you do not trust men you do not have to manage. That's why, Lieutenant ... ... based on that you are 4 Americans vs 21 Greeks, ... I will take over the administration. Do not bet for that, Lieutenant. - All good; - Okay... Except I discovered something I have to tell you. The reason they are the bayonets were clean. These guys always they clean up after the battle. Immediately after the battle. We misunderstood them. Hey, boss. This guy it took us a bass, boss. After trapping his patrol, he and his friend got far enough ... to take a good look behind their fire dam. - They did not think they would. - Collar and infantry gathering, sir. Incredible concealment. Over there, about 4.5 km They are waiting to lure our attack and break our right edge. Maybe I'll take this place sometime finally, Lieutenant. But not what you intended. You understand the importance this information ... ... to reach the Headquarters before the attack? - Actually, Lieutenant. - Well ... take a man. Choose yours. I do not want to see each other again your face, if you fail. Yes, Lieutenant. We'll go to the boats. Sergeant ... You can build bogies for the injured? Of course, but carrying bogies we will not succeed. What about the bulldozer? It works. We will link the trailer back and we will put the wounded in the carriage. How about that, boss? It makes noise, but with so many vehicles in they may think they are theirs. A kind of Trojan Horse, right? Why not; Get a job right away. This is an order. I said, it's an order, Sergeant! You heard him. Lieutenant Lieutenant he's ready, sir. "Lieutenant Lieutenant is ready, sir. " - How did he suddenly take it? - Are you making a bunch, Stummer Stone? Listen, Sam knows what he's doing. Why do you care? about UN-law? Someone gave him this office? Yes, but who has named Nick? The Grace from the prison camp? Soldier. Nobody has appointed anyone or something. We're the same. Either you approve it or not. The regulations do not write who he must run such a unit. I approve the withdrawal by the Lieutenant. At least until it appears our Captain. - Are you ready, Sergeant? - Whenever you are, sir. - What it says; - He's sorry for us. He said he should not to be of concern to Nikia. Niki comes from a mountainous area where people are strong drinkers. He also says we do not care how does the rest of us feel about us? He knows the Americans they are wonderful men. Tell him to cut the plate. Sergeant ... - We have to go back up again. - We can not, Lie Lieutenant. The road is too narrow for to reverse this thing. We can set up a roadblock. Will not we have time to get the injured. They will alert soldiers from other regions, Lochia. The war will fall on us. Niki will tell us rather to throw stones at him. - Boomman. - Yes Boss. Do you see what I see? Around that turn. Perhaps, boss, maybe. - How many dynamite balls did you have? - Only 2 but worth trying. I have to borrow your "pillow". - What happens; - Fougas (paranaloma). Better than to cast stones. Bowman ... Tell the Lieutenant. All right, boss. - Wonderful idea, I would not think about it. - What do you say now. I never doubted that your Lieutenant is a military genius. Sergeant ... how did he call it? Fougas? Yes, crazy-gasoline, Lieutenant. We used to turn the perimeter on. We saw it from the French. It's a terrible bay, when it catches. It reaches the last turn. It will be here in less than 1 minute. Okay, enough. Are you ready, buddy? We will fire with a low impulse. Go ahead, go! They will see the smoke, Sergeant. Go for the bulldozer down there. We will not be secret for much more. Trying to get to it bulldozer in the river would be suicide. And I can not let go injured. I'm afraid we've arrived at the end of the trip. Soon it will be dark. Then I will ask Nikos ... ... to transport us on that slope. - We'll fight from there. - For how long; Until the morning this hill will be filled with communists. And how they will go back the information; I decided to send you and your men. Why us? ... Why do not you send? some of your own men? I find it prohibitive to deny them the privilege ... ... to stay with their comrades. I do not ask you to save yourself. It will not be easy to pass. First you have to escape the enemy. Then you have to cross the river. All this until 08:00, which starts our attack. But perhaps, you Engineer, you can do this ... ... that ordinary Greeks soldiers can not. Are you asking me to act, Lieutenant? How you will succeed, It depends on you. Thanks. Tell Nick to be careful the second speed, skits. What are they doing; Do they make a dam? - Undersea bridge. - They will have done enough at night. That's why the identifiers they have not found anything. Sam, the chariots that we were told by the New Zealanders. They will carry the chariots from the hill. They will carry them through the bridge right at Jango Hill. Someone has to notify them quickly. Maybe you brought a postal pigeon with bulletproof vest. We were boats. It looks like someone it should be wet. Of course, what you need someone to do is to ... ... swim in the river with them Communists throwing bullets. And if he does, he should to run before breakfast. Do you have a better idea, Sergeant? If you swim 4 ... One might overtake to arrive on time. Whatever you say, boss. Who says they can not send 4 medals at home? I'll take mine now. It's part of the team delivered. They say Captain Haros has asked volunteers to surrender. As long as the Communists they were employing them ... ... Captain Haros passed through with the main force. They had orders to show up here in case they escaped. That's what they say. Let's go swimming. With the wireless of course, certainly we will contact the Division. - It may appear in 1-2 weeks. - Okay, we went through the bulldozer, right? No one can go so late. Charm will reach wherever he is. It will dawn soon and we will not no luck ... we leave, go ahead. All right, let's get lost. We will wait. Hey, boss! Kids, looks like they are do not expect to see me again. - Not only you. - Where's the rest of the squad? Everyone is dead. - I said, where is the rest of the squad? - They're dead. - Captain Hare. - Chuck, Lieutenant. I wish I could do something. I'm so sorry. The Communists have torn our boats. I need to use your wireless. - Can you call the Division? - No, our frequency ... - ... is set for the Brigade. - This is enough. Until now, we were away even for them. Maybe from here. We've seen a lot, Lieutenant. Infantry, infantry, material, moving upward. I know how it is going to be to use it. Contact the Murray patrolman. Coordinates of this bridge. - Exactly there, sir. - Wonderful, Major. They will pass across and they will hit us right here. With our armor on the wrong side, they will catch us like the mice in the phaco. Only they forgot the bridge has two directions. Tell the General that he should to see him directly, is urgent. Call Airspace. Communicate with them, Major and ... ... tell them to find a tall one point and stay there. He called Sawyer. Tell him we're going to untie them. Welcome, sir. Now, better to leave. With what's left of us. I see we brought the enemy with us. But help is on the way. - The lieutenant arranged it. - But I thought you were going ... We were lucky on the bank. Captain Haros arrived with the radio. No, it did not to "actions", right? It depends how you mean it this, Lieutenant. The Regulation has not been written for such Kind of Unit. Sometimes, men like me, they must see everything printed. In great print. Hey, Sam! Sam, come! - Helicopters! - Helicopters! We brought almost all helicopters in Korea, for you. Last Departure! Quickly! - How many men do you have? - Ten! My capacity is eight. I'll get you all.
