PICK UP THE PHONE SU-JEONG HEY HEY HEY, CHEON SU-JEONG! Let's hear a toast from our core member, the essence of Visual Rising. Mr. Seo Gwan-su, everyone. THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE PLEASE PICK UP, ANSWER ME PLEASE As I've told you many times before, I hate being bossy like an old-fashioned jerk. Consider me as your buddy or brother, and let's fight for our goal together in a casual, relaxed working environment. Today! We'll make a three-step toast. - Oh god. - Didn't we do it last time? - One! - For confidence! Two! - For expertise! - For expertise! Three, step out to the street! - Step out to the street! - Step out to the street! - They're so noisy. - Go ahead, step out to the street. I am Cha Jung-won from the Video Design Team! It's a pleasure meeting you! Good evening! I am Shin Min-jae from the Video Design Team! I was born in 1999, - Born in 1999? - the year of the rabbit. - Ninety-nine? - Ninety-nine? I took the college entrance exam last year. Thank you! Good evening. I am Oh Seon-yeong, from the Planning Team. It's great to meet you and thank you for having me. So pretty! Do you have a boyfriend? No, I don't have one for now. Oh, "for now"? Then when was your last relationship? Come on. Tell us. We're curious! - We're curious... - Seon-yeong. Seon-yeong. I love you. Would you marry me? - Unbelievable. - No way! - Accept him! - Accept him! - Accept him. - Say yes. Such an adorable couple. She said they broke up this morning. She wasn't answering, so he went through all the bars around here. Should I say he's lucky? What? Are they praying? What the... They're getting back? What are they doing? They're kissing. Kiss... - Let go of me! - He's grabbing her leg. Why grab... The coat's coming off. - Let go! - It's coming off! - She's taking it off! - Oh, come on! And it's off. He pulled the coat off. SU-JEONG ARE YOU BUSY? OR ASLEEP? Jeez, what a show they're putting on. What? Here she comes again! Jeez, what a scene. Sure, you need your purse and coat back. Right. What a mess. - Seon-yeong! - Now that's just embarrassing. The moment I hear "Let's split up," I'd fall out of love right away. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU REALLY ASLEEP? DONG-HWA PLEASE PICK UP THE PHONE IT HAS TO BE YOU INCOMING CALL FROM DONG-HWA CALL BLOCKED YOU VITCH! BITCH! SORRY MORON Dude, I told you. I came home. You sure you didn't go to Su-jeong? You think I'm nuts? Are you sure? Yes, I am. What the hell? Who are you? - What? - What is it? A girl? - Hello? -A cat... You mean pussy? - Cut it off. I'm going now. - You dog, you... Damn it. You signed a two-year contract, but leaving only in four months, and now you can't let us show them around the house? I'm sorry. I'm in a bit of situation. You know, I brought you the floor plan anyway. Could you please cut me some slack? Gosh, this isn't the first time! Who signs a contract without seeing the house? I can't help you out at all like this, that's all I have to say. Jae-hun? Lee Jae-hun! It is you, right? Never thought I'd meet you here. What are the chances? Come on! I'm Jeong-su. From Nanumi, the charity club. Right, Park Jeong-su! It's Kim Jeong-su. Yeah, I remember. I'm sorry. You've changed a lot. I've put on some weight, right? You know how it is. Booze is my only pleasure in life. - It looks like you had some as well. - Yes. Well... It's tough, isn't it? Hey, want to see my kids? I've still got time, take a look. What do you think? These kids... They don't look like me, right? Well, they say a son resembles his mother. But she told me she's a natural beauty. - How many plastic surgeries... - Come on. What you saying? They're adorable and cute. They look just like you. Really? Which part? You're still in good shape, by the way. Your wife's taking good care of you. I heard you got married. I called it off. That's what happened. Nice move, dude. I'm so damn jealous! How did you do it? Staying single. Staying single is a trend! Well done. You can go live a comfortable life. You don't deserve the fuckload of stress that marriage brings. You don't have kids, right? No kids, then that's it! Game over! No worries. I won't tell anyone from school. Hold on. You should tell everyone. Tell them proudly. You go pick up all the chicks, who cares? - Thanks. - Hey, hold on. Just a sec, please. Let's grab drinks sometime. Call me! Almost here, sir. Give me a call! BABY ON BOARD I'll pick you up when you're done. I only got in to stop you from yelling. This is the last time this happens. Don't you ever come back again, got it? Hey! Are you really doing this to me? This is my first day at work. Do you know how much you embarrassed me last night? Okay. It's my fault. I won't do it again. You said you wanted to get married. Let's get married then. We'll run into this and that when living together, and if you react this way to such small stuff, how can I even trust you? When did I even say I want to marry you? And don't trust me. I've never trusted you. Do you think you can just end this as you please? You cheated on me as you pleased. Now I'll do as I please, too. You also cheated on me! That's what it means to be done, dumbass. You should learn to control that nasty temper of yours. That frustration is bound to give you hysteria, you know that? Hey! Good morning... - What's wrong with you? - Good morning! - Tell me. - What? Come on. Tell me more about the pussy you got. - It's an actual cat, I tell you. - Last night, did you... Mr. Kang, could you bring me that one from yesterday? - Okay, sir. - Mr. Lee! Hello, this is Visual Rising. Oh, it's you. Hi. I tried to introduce her last night, but both of you vanished halfway. Well, I don't really care about your private life, but don't tell me you already got something going on. Go on, have a seat. She's not my type. I was joking, of course. You got something to drink? Nice to meet you. Welcome aboard. Right on. Nice to meet you too, man. I was joking! It's a pleasure meeting you, boss. Why, isn't she full of fun surprises? These are our proposals from the last three months. Only four of them from the top were signed. Please finish the proposal by the end of the day. The review is in two days, so that's your deadline. Thanks. Could you do it? Yes. It must be way more boring compared to your former TV ad projects. Well... I'm just grateful that I got the job in this jobless era. You're not getting back with your ex-boyfriend? Well, he's obviously trying very hard. Perhaps there might be some misunderstanding. One night, he said he met his ex at his school reunion. Next thing I know, he wasn't responding until 3 p.m. the next day. He told me he was sleeping, but you never know if he was home or at a motel. You seem to have moved on to another guy right away. "Right away." Then how long do I need to wait before moving on? At least a month? Or a year? I don't know who decides stuff like that. Well, dating and breaking up is some serious stuff. Right. By the way, which year were you born? In 1985. Oh, me too. We're the same age. You can talk down to me. I really don't care. Actually... I'm older than you. I was born in January. Be honest with me. About what? You called her. I told you I didn't. You mark my words. Girls never come back once they leave, got it? When girls say they want to break up, it means they're all prepared to move on. Come on, man. Hey. She might be doing it too. She did revenge cheat on her boyfriend. See? If girls want to get married, then they start to clean up their past and never let you know that they're taken. Their strong willingness to move on anytime... What an asshole! You know that cheating is habitual, never a random mistake? Fuck. I thought she was talking to me. If you forgive him cause he's begging you, you're ruining your own life! He's one of those nutjobs who flip and pour acid or swing knives at their exes. It was all over the news for a while. You should be careful. He is so shameless. How can he come visit you and even beg you? Guys nowadays are the last generation where sons were more preferred. At least, old generations taught sons responsibility as the man of the family. But these boys, they're just spoiled. Most of them are just no better than a kid throwing a fit at Toys-R-Us. So, that's why some boys insist on equal contribution to buying house, but women being in charge of housework even if they're both working. Wait, which guys in our office are still not married? Mr. Lee and Mr. Kang from the CG team? They say Mr. Kang has a boyfriend. There's no decent man. Mr. Lee got his marriage canceled a month ago. He even sent out his invitations and tried to quit the job. Some say Mr. Seo stopped him so that he won't kill himself. They're from the same college. Connections. Dude, hurry up and decide. Are you in, or are you out? Come on, a friend of your girlfriend? Doesn't that mean she's like 20? I know, right? Could it get any better? You pervert. You look stinky now. So dull, you smell like balls. Just eat. Keep eating. Hey, sweetie. Daddy's working now, of course. Daddy misses you very much, too. No, no! Let your mother sleep... Hi, honey. There was money in the freezer? How much... Five hundred thousand won? Come on, no! How could I ever stash... No honey, listen. Honey, no! Damn it. I'm screwed when I got home. How could she sniff that out? Oh, you're still here? Yes. Well, if it's because of Mr. Seo, you don't have to. He doesn't really go home even after work is done. Rumor has it that his wife beats him. Do you think Mr. Lee went home? I think he's grabbing a drink. He's not answering, right? He drinks day and night these days. Don't take what he says while drunk seriously. That's his drinking habit. Go home already. I'm leaving, see you tomorrow. Sure. Take care. DONG-HWA: LOVE YOU SORRY, IT WASN'T FOR YOU Why the fuck should I apologize? I just checked the CCTV footage of the corridor. Look, I don't want to make a scene, so I won't report it. All I want from you is to admit it and apologize. Frankly speaking, I wasn't the only guy who used to come over. How many guys you've been going out so far, including me? You've lived there for ten years. What are you trying to say? I'm just saying you sure do have a lot of guys going in and out of your house. Fuck. I shouldn't have dated a slut like you. Right. As you said, I do have experience with a lot of guys. That's why I have to tell you, You have a tiny cock. Your big toe looked bigger. Hey! You bitch! Hey, you should have taken away my cell phone. Bullshit! You were going to kill me if I took it from you. - Don't you remember? -You should have just killed me. Dude, you only got your marriage canceled. It's not the end of your life, you know... Just hang up. Fuck! No, I mean, it's not my cat. Okay. It suddenly came into my home by accident. - On the 18th floor? - That's right. The 18th floor. Then why did you call me? It said on the Internet that I should call the district office. - Did you try calling Animal Farm? - Animal Farm, the TV show? Yes. Those guys are good with animals. Right. Come on... I mean... SU-JEONG, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ANSWER ME, SU-JEONG. ARE YOU ASLEEP? Mom, I really don't feel the need. Getting my house trashed was enough, why do you have to do this to me? Why would you come to Seoul? Mom, as for guys, I'm dating them when I want to. It's you who's ashamed of me, not myself. Mom, all the men here are married. Right, there are some. The one who likes men, and another whose marriage was canceled. I don't know, maybe he did something he shouldn't have. Something he should... He should be proud of himself. It's not his fault at all. Right? He should be... Oh, meals? - Mom, I'll call you later. - That's no fish, that must be a rock! No, man. It's a jackpot. There's a huge carp on that hook and I know it. Seriously, this big. No way. From the way it's fighting, it looks more like a whale than a carp. Come. Eat. - Hello. - What are these? What's with the corns? I don't know. I bought them when I was drunk and can't really remember. They'll make a perfect bait for carp fishing. You should've steamed them first. No, give me that. Are you sure you didn't steal them? Cut him some slack, man. I mean, how can he know what he's done? He doesn't remember a thing. We can't be sure he bought them. - Forget it. - Hey, calm down! - Give it back. - All right, we'll stop. You shut up. - Are you taking some? - I am. Let's divide it in half then. They're tasty. Share it with your wife. You know, you're not in your twenties anymore. It ended in anecdotes until now. But when you're old, things might end in a criminal case. Blackout is a serious thing, not some joke. I won't drink. I'll stop. I stopped. - Bullshit. - Quit, my ass. Stop taking them so much. Hey, what's wrong? The call was connected, but I don't remember it. Isn't it a wrong number? Fuck, I talked for two hours. - Is the meeting ready? - Yes, it is. Would you like a cup of coffee? - Isn't that Su-jeong? - No, it's not. She reads all of my drunk texts, but never responds. Who is it then? You said there were missed calls? Don't you recall any of that conversation? - This is driving me nuts. - How's this? Let's try linking the number to the messenger. Almost everyone's using it now. You can find out who it is with the messenger profile for this number. - What? What's that? - Dumbass. Give me your phone. Save the number. Then open the messenger... Oh, no. Why is it calling? Hang up, hang up! What the hell did you tap speakerphone for? - Hang up! - Hello? Hang up, quick! Hello? - Hello? - Yes? This is Lee Jae-hun. Who is this? Go on, please. Hello? Who is... I'm Lee Jae-hun. Who's this? Talk to me, please. Is this you, Su-jeong? It's you! Su-jeong. Jae-hun is suffering... So, what you're saying is when mom gathers up the laundry and says the line, we move on to the scene where a child is watching OkayBoy on the table? No. First, mom shakes out the laundry and what's the line again? "Thanks to OkayBoy, my son is really into learning!" and the camera moves backward. Then at the back, her son is reading a book, cut to next scene, where the book changes into OkayBoy. Isn't it better if the product shows up first? There seems to be no difference. No way, wait a minute. You think it seems to be made for study? It's a fat and ugly iPad after a failed plastic surgery. Look how fat it is! What's this? Who installed games on this thing? Who? Ms. Oh, what do you think? Well, I think including a scene to promote the image of an electronic book is essential in order to highlight its function as a learning aid. No parent would want to buy their child a game console. I like Mr. Lee's idea. See? She likes me. I mean, she likes my idea. Doesn't she? She likes my idea, right? So, what did you two talk about? Two hours is quite a long time. Are you sure you didn't say what you weren't supposed to? Like your history with Su-jeong? Stop. I mean, she looks too okay to say you did. Maybe she doesn't remember talking to you. No way. Forget it. Just ask her about it. Nowadays your reputation's already down the shitter... Seriously, way down the shitter. So you can just apologize for what you've done wrong. That's what I was trying to do... It's 420,500 won in total. Who's paying? Where is Ms. Oh? She went to Chuncheon for on-site registration. Something was wrong with printing, so she set off right after lunch. Alone? With Do-yun. So that she can learn. When is she coming back? I guess around the time we punch out. Chuncheon's pretty far away. Is there anything you need her to do? No, never mind. OH SEON-YEONG I'M LEE JAE-HUN. CAN WE TALK FOR A MINUTE? Seriously? - Hey. - I see you're still in. You went to Chuncheon? Why didn't you answer your phone? They told me not to answer your calls after working hours because you would be drunk. I called you in the daytime, too. They said you sometimes drink in the daytime too. I apologize. I'll see you tomorrow. - There's something... - Yes? Nothing. Right. I'll see you. I mean... Did we talk on the phone yesterday? In the morning? Goodness. You were drinking? What are you doing here? So good to see you! Let's go! Let's go for a second drink! - You drank a lot. - Second drink! - Turn it off. - Fine. - I'm leaving now, you two go ahead... - No, come with us. Forget her. Let her go have her affair. What are you saying? Gosh. He told me not to tell you. I heard you had an affair once. You prick! Me, in an affair? - My girlfriend - No, he did. - also had an affair. - I mean... My girlfriend cheated on me, too. With a high school senior. How could she cheat on me? With a minor, too. Seriously? I never told him you had an affair. I said you revenge cheated. I only moved on because we were done. How could you put it as revenge cheating? We weren't even married. If you do it before you both say it's over, doesn't it count? Come on. He didn't say he was cheating but it still counts. You don't have to say anything. It's all the same. Cheating doesn't work if you say you'll cheat. Where's my phone? Your phone for what? To report that high schooler? From what I see, you're the one who should be thrown in jail. The relationship is over once you meet someone else. What else does the partner have to say? What do you want them to say? Ah, wait, wait. Wait a minute. I mean, is that really important now? What's important is that I wasn't in an affair. Only lies come out of your mouth! - I'm not lying! - You're a liar. What's wrong with you girls? - That's what you call an affair. - He's way too drunk. Keep it down, will you? I'm sorry. It's smashed. - Smashed to pieces. - Want to know why? Because you threw it into the road, you idiot. I'm going to break up with her, so don't you dare stop me! - I won't! - Even if she begs me... - Where are you going? - Excuse me, where's the toilet? Outside, on the second floor. It's to your left. Second floor on the left? It's so embarrassing. I can't stand it. You vile, treacherous witch! - What's wrong with him? - You bitch. - What a prick! - I'm sorry. Such a perfect match. I'll get going too. I can't take it anymore. Wait, I need to say this before I go. Could you please stop talking behind my back when you don't even know me that well? You're right. Just like you did on the phone today. At the parking lot in front of the office. I was only talking about what really happened. But you told him what never happened. And as for me, I was talking to my mom. Isn't that different from telling your colleagues? So I've done something I shouldn't have? And I should be proud? If you say so, do you know you called me last night, drunk out of your mind? Is it also okay for you if I talk about it to the colleagues? Are you proud of that too? Hey. What? Are you really going to tell them? I'll go. I'll see you tomorrow. You're really telling them? You should be punished. You committed a crime! What did I do? What... Let go, this cardigan is expensive! Please call the police. Ma'am, what happened? Look, he came in when I was in the toilet, and he was listening to me go! - Pardon? - What? I was totally humiliated. I told you, I didn't even know. I came in mid-poo! You were listening, pervert! At first you were humming, but suddenly went silent when you heard me go! Hey, listen! Can you tell one's gender from their pooping sounds? Can anyone here do that? - Anyone? - Stop it already! How old are you? - Old enough to tell perverts apart! - You little... - Come on, don't. - Sir, ma'am... - Motherfucker! - I'm no slut you can spy on! - Stop it, dumbass. I'm sorry, ma'am. - I'll kick your ass, I tell you. He's a nice guy, I think you misunderstood him. He's too drunk now. Drink it, it'll ease you. We need to work tomorrow. Well, there are no cabs. I'm checking it but there's none. There are bars all around here. I'm sure it'll come along. Can't you remember anything about last night? I didn't know until I saw my phone this morning. I'm sorry I talked about your ex behind your back. I tried to apologize from the first, but this dumbass got in... We didn't really talk much. You just kept crying. For two hours? Why didn't you hang up? You said you're crying because nobody listens to you, so I felt bad. Get up. Let's go. Why are you sending me off? You guys are going to get naughty, aren't you? - Aren't you? - Whatever. Take this and drink it at home. My cab will be here in a minute, can you go by yourself? Want to grab a drink with me? Do you do this all the time? You're not a teenager, you know. You seem to be taking it too seriously, as if it were your first breakup ever. I've dated enough. I'm just getting more and more confused. The more you look at someone and the more you talk with them, the more you figure out about them. Maybe that's why they tell you to date and marry your date before you really know them. You've never loved someone with all your heart, have you? I just never fantasized about love. All the old sayings turned out to be true for me. "It's better to date as many boys as you can." "Men are all the same," things like that. Damn, sounds like you've only dated assholes. For me, they were just average guys. Well, it goes the same for the girls too, doesn't it? You didn't know that? Girls are all the same. Just like the boys. So, it means, there is nothing to anticipate, and nothing to be disappointed about. I don't mean to offend you but you're a bit pathetic. Then, you're saying you're different from them? Is that what you think? Isn't it obvious? You meet someone you truly love, date her, marry her, and grow old together for the rest of your life. Isn't that what the happiness of life is all about? Are you drunk? It's perfect, right now. Why don't you play a game with me? Next! - "Dick!" - "Sick!" - Wasn't it "Dick?" - You're wasted. It was "Dick!" Why do you deny it? All right, my turn. "Snack." How do you do that? Too easy. - See... - Hurry up! What? "Cock?" "Cock!" - "Lock!" It's "Lock!" - It was "Lock"? - Wasn't it "Cock"? - No, it's "Lock." - It was "Cock," right? - Try again. Wasn't it "Cock," Mr. Cock? Seriously? "Pussy"? "Pushy"! Wasn't it "Pussy"? - Knock it off. Stop. - It was "Pussy"! I drank it. Next round. Why am I so wasted? Can I get a soju, please? Sorry. - All right, then. - We're sorry. I'll give you another one. Guess what I'm saying here. Here, take a look. Too long. - It's too long. - So, take a good look. "I want to..." "Have tax with you?" Oh Seon-yeong! - Hey! - Hi. I'm her friend. Nice to meet you. Have a seat, please. If you came a bit later, I almost had sex with him! She usually doesn't get drunk like this... - Am I drunk? - Get up. - I shouldn't get drunk... - You can't even stand up. She says the darndest things when she's hammered like this. Many guys fell for it only to regret it. - So don't... - No. - You're wrong. - No more drinks for you. He said he wanted to have sex with me first. You pervert! All I said was I want to have "tax" with you. Did you say you want to have "tax"? And I won't sleep with you! - What's that? - Of course, you won't. I won't, I won't! You're not my type. But you're my type. Really? No. Like I said, she's drunk. Let's head out first. Oh Seon-yeong! Come here. - Don't. - Why not? No. Bad girl. Stop, I said. - Get her off me. - Careful. What the heck? My gosh, are you okay? What the hell? No. Don't do that! Good heavens! Somebody, please help me. What the hell... God damn it. I'm getting back together with her. Moron. SENT TO: OH SEON-YEONG "I'm really thankful to you, actually." "Even though I don't remember, LOL." "Thanks for answering my call and drinking with me, LOL." "You seem like a very nice person. Hope we get along well, LOL." I hate it when guys use LOL in texts. It sounds like they're mocking you. Aren't you too sensitive? Then what, does texting ROFL mean they're nicer? So? Is he really thankful or does he want to get laid? It's his drinking habit. He calls random people when he's hammered out of his mind, and regret it the next day, quite typical. Now I hate him even more. What about work? I'm struggling every morning to wake up. When I get home, I just want to lie down. Pretty different from last time, right? I'm cleaning all the time, but it always gets messy again in a minute. It's an endless fight. Hyeon-jin! Hyeon-jin, go buy yourself a treat. Say "I need more, Auntie." His dad doesn't help you? Are you kidding? At first, he didn't even lift a finger when I asked him for help. Then I asked him, "Throwing out food waste or vacuum cleaning?" He chose vacuum cleaning. Then I asked "Changing diapers or washing dishes?" He chose washing dishes. He only wants to do the easy stuff. Why bother asking him at all, right? Still, you look good. Are you teasing me? You haven't changed a bit. You think so? Psyche. I hate you. You were totally insane last night. You don't really remember a thing? - Last night, ma'am? - Yes. - Me, ma'am? - Yes, ma'am. I'll make sure to call you if I do. Hyeon-jin, Auntie's leaving. - Say "Bye Auntie!" - Bye Hyeon-jin! You lunatic. You were so messed up - last night... - What, dumbass? Come on out. Let's go for a smoke. I'm quitting. My girlfriend came back on the condition of my quitting. But she's the one who cheated on you. Why does she get to make you do stuff? You should quit smoking, too. Is that quitting? It's like having bread instead of rice. Good morning! Good morning, Seon-yeong! I'm getting back with my Byeol! Are you feeling better? What happened to us last night? Well, you two kind of got closer, didn't you? Drinking does that, it brings people closer. How dare you smoke here? You know the office is a non-smoking area! You smoke in here, too. You said as long as it's vape, it's fine! My company, my rules. - Now, get out. - Why? Where are we going? Jae-hun, you should have more tea. I need more coffee... - What? What? - Cut it out, you idiot! - What are you making that face for? - Hey, stop. That's embarrassing. By the way, did I... Did I make any mistakes last night? - What's that? - Well... I remember we sent him home in a taxi, and then we went to the tent bar. But after that... We drank a lot. I was also too drunk to remember. I think... I don't really get along with her. Who? Oh Seon-yeong? Why? Did something happen after I left? No, not at all. Right, she's not exactly the comfortable type. But she's not a bad person, though. Look who's judging. Hey, don't you remember last night? I do, you dumbass! We had some beers by Han River, and went to the karaoke, right? Forget it. And don't go out drinking in this area for the time being. Especially not at that Japanese bar. - What, why? - It's better not to know. Order, please! - Coming! - You're going to the studio today, right? Yes, the lookbook and a little bit of video footage. Right, let me do it for you today. I can take care of it. I know. I don't want to stay in the office today. Well, of course. I'd appreciate it. Excuse me! Hello? Yes, we'll be there in about ten minutes. Okay. They say the filming crew and models are already there. Yes, Seon-yeong's in charge now. Have a nice trip! This tiny company has got no system, I tell you. Making one person do this, do that... Maybe you should prepare for the state exam while you're still young. Be a good son and become a civil servant. I had spent three years on that, but no. Hey you, yellow fan. Get out. I said get out! Why are you... - Out! Out, come on. - God damn it. Camera right, fool. To your left! - I'm sorry. - Let's set up the light and go again. Why does he still not get camera angles? Time for camera roll change. They say we can't extend it right now. They're fully booked. Damn it. I told them not to take this job. Why are you barefoot? There were no slippers left. I'm fine, though. They're too small. My feet hurt. Crank up the dimmer switch a little. Okay, good. A little more. Just a bit more. Good. Okay, we're ready. Is it good to go now? Wait, hold on. Could you reduce the shadow a little? You, bring me the extra lights. But we didn't unload the 100W lights. Son of a bitch. Do-hyeon, go get it. If you could tell me what it looks like, I'll go get... It's hard to describe in words. It's... I'll just go get it. Careful, you're holding the camera right now! - You dumb... - I know what it is, I'll go get it. - Thank you for your work. - Thank you all. By the way, did you ever work as a staff on-set? I mean, you're quite good at installing the monitors and stuff. I made good friends with the lighting director from my previous job. Who is he? I bet I know him. I know everyone in this field. Come on, don't ask such questions. It's obvious that he was her boyfriend. Wasn't he? But he's not working in this field now. Why? He's dead. I see. An accident? Suicide. Well, someone I know also killed himself. - Could it be the same guy? - Is that so? Go outside and have a smoke. I don't smoke. Just go smoke. Start smoking! - Just start smoking today. It's easy. - Why are you beating my head? They've also got Byeong-cheol the Moron here. - You dumbass... - What? What did I do? - Can we get the bill, please? - Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee might be going for another booze. Where do you live? I'll give you a ride. It seems like we went over the budget. Is that okay? Oh, right. This one's on Mr. Lee. You know, we're always short on money in this field. People often talk it out and skip dinner to save money. But Mr. Lee's not like that. He buys dinner and drinks every time. He's such a nice guy even from men's point of view. I've no idea why he ended up with such a tragedy. You know, usually a man's man are not welcomed by girls at all. Maybe you're right. Thanks for the meal. LEE JAE-HUN: WHAT YOU DOING? YOU ASLEEP? DON'T DRINK TOO MUCH AND GET HOME SAFELY LEE JAE-HUN: I'M NOT DRINKING COFFEE? I GOT SOMETHING TO SAY I said I wasn't drinking, but I didn't say that I didn't drink. Do you ever sober up if you do it every day? I just can't stay sober. Get up, I'll get you a cab. Hey, do you like me? You want to go home, or stay the night here? Or not. I spent all my savings and even got the loan on that house. After I had sent out the invitations and our families met together, I came to think "Man, I need to work really hard." So, I voluntarily started overworking almost every day. I felt sorry for being tied up with my work. One day, I finished work early and came home without telling her. The TV was too loud. I can't really remember that well. What was it that she said again? "Girls are happier if they marry the one who loves them, not the one they love," or something like that. She thought I was that one. Hey, hold on. My arm! I broke my arm. So, what's the competition rate? It's 8:1, but actually more like 3:1. Isn't it cute? Then does it mean our ad may appear on TV? We'll post it as in-stream video ads, and make a series if people like it. And the best one out of the series will be on TV. Amazing. What a profitable condom this is. It'll be tough work but among Zebra, Leopard, and Tiger, we got Tiger, the strongest one! Since we got newcomers, and it's about time we had a little refreshment, I'd like to suggest a staff retreat on the 17th. - Seventeenth? - Yes. Remember, it's not mandatory. Let's see. The 17th is... - Saturday. - Right. Where are we going? Cheonggyesan. Nice, right? Let's get to the peak and roar like a tiger! We'll prey on the Zebra and Leopard! Is he out of his mind? Who goes hiking now? Autumn leaves viewing season is over. Let us shout out the slogan to cheer ourselves up. How about yo-ho, yo-ho? Yo-ho, my ass. We're fucked, that's what. Condoms? We're making an ad for condoms, the most unwanted item for ad companies! Planning Team, we're counting on you. What the heck are we going do with condoms? Peepee-wrapper. You nutjob. MR. SEO SENT YOU AN EMOTICON Let's go, Visual Rising! The group chat is so silent these days. I'm heading to a meeting now. Let's go! Go! Go! - Let's go! - Go! Go! Be careful. Didn't someone get the rooms mixed up before? That was scary. Gosh, I thought it was the same group chat. Let's go for lunch. What are you having today? A bowl of Seo Gwan-su, perhaps. What should I have today? By the way, Mr. Lee seemed to have had a lot to drink last night. Should I call him and wake him up? Did you drink with him last night? What happened? No, I didn't. Why? Did something happen? God knows where he tumbled down, but he broke his arm. He went to the emergency room late at night and everything. Are you coming with us for lunch? Yes. Hello. Are you okay? I've got some extra work to do. Is there anything I can help? I'm sorry about last night. It won't happen again. I think this incident has, you know, taught me a lesson. Now I'm going to stop and snap out of it. Leave it. Want to grab something to eat? Can I get a bottle of soju, please? - No, don't give us. - Yes, please. Yes, please. Everyone here is having soju with pork. - Here you are. - Thanks. Your clothes, they're all like that. Yes, you. What? They're pretty. Men stare at you, even though they don't look like it. I'm wearing this to look pretty. I'm not naked or something. Look, listen. Like from the movie 300, there's a muscular man... who's wearing a cloak. And there are tiger patterns all over the cloak, too. Like from the movie, he shouts out "Sparta!" and runs to kick him in the chest. Then, the man who fell down the pit suddenly bounces up in the air! The cloak and trampoline here represent the condom. And this man bounced up from the pit represents the semen. Then what is the pit? - It means the woman's fur burger... - Excuse me! - Doesn't it sound good? - One more soju, please. Work should be discussed in the workplace. - Thanks. - Thank you. I can't bend my arms. You pour it for yourself. Hey, why... Why aren't you getting married? It's not that I don't want to, I can't. Because I can't trust. Is that because you can't get over the ex who killed himself? That was a lie. Such a person never existed. I just say that because people don't ask me anymore. I've never told anyone what I told you last night. I didn't ask you to tell me. Unbelievable. You really are something. Do you think you're any better than me? Hey, don't you... Don't you take that tone with me. He's wasted again. Let go! Yes, you're right! Let's get the facts straight. Why did you do that to me? Do what? You threw out your drinks behind my back. I'm going to the restroom! Right? You never blacked out. That was on purpose, wasn't it? What was that? Since I'm technically your superior, were you somehow trying to suck up to me? I mean, you don't even have any feelings for me. What was that? I did it because you suck. You're acting like a douche for some lousy bitch of a woman who's an embarrassment to women, like a butcher's dog who wags his tail to his owner, who's about to kill him! You know, guys will all try to hook up with you if you get drunk and flirt with them like that. You should know better. You're just pitiful and pathetic. You're a pathetic, unmarried douche too. Look at you, a total old man. Am I the only one who gets old? No way! Men are not like women. They're the same. What did you learn from school? So dating's so easy for you. And so is breaking up. It's all so easy for you, isn't it? Even lying is easy! What? Do you think it was easy from the start? Well, what I've been called ever since I broke up with my first boyfriend was a "slut." Because for you men, We're all sluts except for the first-love bitches that you couldn't have sex with. Don't get cute with me, hand-cripple. 10 MISSED CALLS FROM LEE JAE-HUN LEE JAE-HUN: WHAT YOU DOING? YOU ASLEEP? ALREADY? WE NEED TO TALK. I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID... HEY OH SEON-YEONG What happened? - Are you okay? - Yes. You're acting weird these days. What do you mean? I mean, you don't mention Su-jeong anymore. Right? He never did, you always brought it up. You're not getting back together, are you? Man, why would I? Once you break up, you shouldn't get back together. When a relationship is not working, there's always a reason for that. It just shows your lack of willpower. What, love is all about timing? It's a big fat lie. So you... I mean you. Are you getting along well? I think we're really breaking up this time. She asked me if she had a big head, so I told her no. But she kept telling me to be honest. So I said "It's good enough," then she started suspecting me because it sounded like I don't think her head is small. So, I said "It's not that big," and she said, "Then it's not that small." I mean, we're not singing round songs. I got annoyed after doing it all day long, so I said, "Of course your skull is not like the size of a fist." And I never heard from her again. You're never getting married, I'm sure. Right, you're not. You can't. I've lost my appetite. Eat. If you breathe with your mouth, you'll get tired soon. Inhale through your nose, exhale through your mouth! Bring it on! What is this retreat for? I want to quit, seriously. It's not like we don't have work to do. He's the only one who's happy now. I'm so sick of it. If you're too tired, shall we shout out the slogan? How about yo-ho, yo-ho? Now we're sliding down, breathe with your mouth! One, two, three, four! Come forward, Mi-yeong. Tired people should take the lead. This is what you wear on a hiking trip. Byeong-cheol, don't you have anything better than that? Don't get me wrong. It's just because they might think weird if I blow you off. Do you know that? You're a terrible liar. What about you? I'm a professional. What's this? I'm pushing you forward. Should I walk in front of you? You want to hold hands with me? You're insane. So should I lean on you like this? Why are your hands shaking, by the way? They're not. Thanks for not telling them my story. I would have already told them if it wasn't your injured arm. Half of what I said was a lie, but the other half was real. There's someone that I want to believe to be dead. Who? The lighting director? He didn't even ask me to break up. I just lost contact with him, and that was it. I had such a hard time, drinking, begging him every day. He even called me a stalker. Then someone told me that if I stopped calling him, he'll call me within three months. Indeed, he called me after just one month, but I didn't answer. You were in pain, why not? I hoped he wouldn't call me. But I wonder now and then. About how he's doing, or if he got married. You climb up by yourself. Damn it. What you guys doing? Are you dating? Keep pace with us! No way, we're not. Here we go, one, two, three! - Hooray! - Hooray! In the name of love, by the golden ratio. Shoot that thing! Seo Gwan-su, you dipshit. Look at your stupid curly hair. Stop thinking about hanging out all the time. If you got money for this, raise their salary instead, you fucker! Yeah, you fucker! Saying shit like "Get-togethers are like voluntary overtimes." That's plain bullshit. Listen, once the minimum wage in Korea reaches 10,000 won, I'll quit this job and start working as a convenience store part-timer. You fucking bastard. He does have a point. - Want us to stop the game, sir? - No, no. - Keep going... - Psyche, you nitwit! You little shit, I'll beat you up. This is why your wife beats you. INCOMING CALL FROM MY ADORABLE LADY I wouldn't take that. You're wasted. Let go of me. I'm not drunk at all. Let go. Let go, I said. It's the other side. - Hello? - Flip it over. What do you want? Who the hell are you to make me report my daily life in detail and even ask for permission? It's your wife, man. Your wife! Even my mom couldn't make me! When I went to the military, she didn't even know I went until my 100th-day leave! My son suddenly came down with a cold. Here's my credit card, don't mind me and have fun. Hurry up, she keeps calling you. - Get home safely. - Bye, sir. Quick, quick! Is it really okay for us to hang around without him? It kind of got weird... ♪ Age is just a number ♪ My friend's in the restroom. Let me... Oh Seon-yeong. Sorry. Oh Seon-yeong? Hey! What are you doing here? Can I have a cigarette? I see your old demons are out. Are you okay? No, I already quit. Because my ex's parents hated smoking girls. Gosh, I feel sick. I think I drank too much, I'm wasted. Stay here, I'll get you some medicine. Stay! What? What's wrong? You okay? I'm not drunk... You're totally drunk, and I totally fell to the ground. I said I'm not drunk. Hey! Why you... You must be out of your mind! This way, we get to unexpectedly touch each other more. Doesn't it give you the butterflies? This is my favorite part of a relationship. But once it gets serious, it gets all boring and painful. - I'm leaving! - Look at me. You're not actually drunk now, are you? Frankly, I did wonder a little. I mean just a little bit, one tiny bit. About what? What would have happened if we kissed that day? You look so sober. Who's in there, drunk you or sober you? Wow, this feels good. I never thought it would be this good. I'm leaving. Oh Seon-yeong. You like me, don't you? No. You don't like me? No, I don't! - Yes, you do... - No, I don't. I don't! You don't? - Is it because you're drunk? - I told you, no. I really don't! For real or not? For real or not? I don't know. I don't like you either. I hate you. I can't sleep well with someone next to me. I've been living alone for too long. Once it gets uncomfortable, I don't sleep properly all night long. That must be hard on you. What kind of food do you like? Me? I visited my parents once and mother made me kimchi stew. It was tasty. So every once in a while, I visited some famous kimchi stew places in Seoul, but none of them had such good stew. I can't eat spicy food, you see. Are you asleep? Can I get some money for a taxi? And a pair of panties, too. I hate you so much. I left all of my belongings at the karaoke last night. My cell phone, purse, and everything. Mi-yeong sent me a message that she left them here. Well, fortunately, they're here. I haven't checked my phone all day long... LEE JAE-HUN: ASLEEP? CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE UP WHERE ARE YOU? YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING MY CALL 1 MISSED CALL FROM LEE JAE-HUN Hey, what happened last night... Who took me to the motel last night? Was it Byeong-cheol? Well, I drank too much to remember. I know, right? Same here. I woke up at my friend's house. Anyway, then I'll see you later. Okay. Take care. SU-JEONG: WHAT ARE YOU DOING? BIG TOE: HOW ARE YOU DOING? BLOCK LEE JAE-HUN It's me. Can we talk for a minute? It'd be better if we can meet up. Who's this? Isn't this Mr. Lee's number? That's right. Well, he's in the bathroom now. Who shall I say is calling? Well, I'm a colleague from Mr. Lee's company. I had something to tell him about work, but we can just talk tomorrow at work. Please tell him to never mind. RECENT CALLS OH SEON-YEONG, DELETE I didn't think the door lock password would be the same. You should clean your house once in a while. What are these, by the way? You have a cat now? I thought you stopped drinking these days, since you stopped calling me. I missed you. Let go. Are you seeing someone? Did you sleep with her? I guess we're better off this way. Now we're finally even. Listen. My parents still went to the wedding hall after you left. Your families never showed up. My parents were there to say sorry to the guests who came anyway. I didn't keep your stuff because I wasn't over you. I was just injured. I'll fix up and sell this house, too. I understand your disappointment. But I know you too well. You wouldn't do that, would you? Are you really sure you can break up with me? Right, I'll wrap it up and talk to the landlady later. Okay. Hey, Park Jeong-su! It's Kim Jeong-su. How are you doing? What? What is it? What happened? Nothing. Hey, your... It just won't come off. I mean, their blood type seemed a bit strange, so I ran a paternity test. The result came out two days ago. But I just can't believe it. They're both not mine. That must have been rough. Well... It took two days. It felt really shitty for two days. I could literally feel that I was about to blow a fuse. Then I wanted to kill them all and myself. And the next moment, come to think of it... I don't think I wasn't really unaware of it. Now that... Now that I made up my mind to live only for myself, it feels much better now. It's fine. It only feels like that just for now. You'll feel fucked up again soon. Even strangers will start giving you their so-called "advice," which of course don't mean shit. And deep down, they'll even look down on you. It's unfair, but you can't help it. You're right. You know, everyone thinks your suffering is a matter of mindset. So don't try so hard, dumbass. Damn it. You have to call me, okay? Yes, I'm almost here, sir. Damn. I don't have your number, man. Thanks to OkayBoy, my son is really into learning! Let's do the next scene. Mr. Lee, Mr. Seo called you for your idea on the Animal Condom project. What about it? By now you should have come up with a scenario... I'm filming now. What the fuck is his job then? Carp fishing? The little fucker should do something if he wants to develop the company. He assigns three people's work to one person like this... No one... I mean no wonder! No wonder employees can't stand the workload and quit in a month! END CALL Well, that was Mr. Lee's idea. Anyone else want to speak up? Oh Seon-yeong! I heard you're working with Mr. Lee on the Animal project. What were you doing while he was getting so fired up? - I'm sorry. - You all get yourself together. Okay? In two days, we'll finish the scenario and arrange the shooting schedule. - Understood? - Yes. He's just taking it out on you because he's doomed if Mr. Lee quits. Wasn't he the one who took us hiking when we had so much to do? Who does he think we are, Genie in a lamp? Don't let it get to you. Cheer up! I'M ALL RIGHT, DON'T... I told you, Mr. Lee's being exploited. Remember on the mountain that day, and at the karaoke where only two of them disappeared? You know those gold digger type of girls. They hit on their male boss to have their way in the office. They say Mr. Lee got back together. Is he two-timing then? I think this is the wrong group chat. I heard that Ms. Oh got fired from her previous job for hitting on her married superior. Her story got spread all over so she came to this small business. Look, here's a posting of it on the internet. It's not here, you idiot! Cut, cut! CRAZY BITCH SHE'S A DISGRACE TO ALL OTHER WOMEN BITCHES BE BITCHES, GOLD DIGGER How can you make her quit like that? Did you even check if it's true? Besides, it happened ages ago! She's the one who wanted to walk out. I tried to persuade her. You know I can't just fire people as I please. We can't hear anything. We're working hard. - Working hard... - You shitheads are the worst! You all like to pretend to be clean and noble people, right? But who here hasn't got skeletons in their closet? Want me to reveal you and see how things shake out? Whoop-de-fucking-doo. How about you go first, Byeong-cheol? Booze shaker? Assholes. Give it to me. Give you what? Give me Seon-yeong's address. Oh Seon-yeong, I know you're in there. Oh Seon-yeong. We need to talk. It's too late for that. I'll talk to you later. Hold on a minute. - Wait. - Leave me alone. Go away! Are you okay? You can't just sit here. You should do something. Shouldn't you? Seon-yeong. He was my superior, so I couldn't avoid him every time. We had a few meals together. When his wife and our colleagues found out, he told them that I hit on him first. And it was my boyfriend at the time, Hyeon-seong, who posted it on the Internet after I went off the grid and disappeared from his sight. I guess he thought he could make me happy by calling me. But when I didn't, he ended up thinking I got another boyfriend and got mad. I don't get what you like about that shit-posting asshole. And you, why? Why are you covering for this guy? Are you stupid? You haven't ever done wrong, you're no criminal. You go and curse them, or sue them! I tried to explain to every other person that I didn't do it and that it was unfair. But all of my personal data were flooding the Internet already. I searched and deleted them and even hired a company to help me out. But it was no use at all. They said things like "Think of it as a good experience," "There's nothing good for a woman to do this," or "Time heals all wounds." They all told me to bear with it. Drink it. So that was why, right? That's why you've been so aggressive to me from the start. Because I'm your superior. It's all over. You should just stay silent too. Why are you doing this? Why, you ask? I just can't stay still. I can't ignore it. Seeing you like this reminds me of myself a short time ago. Gosh, I'm starving. Let's go have dinner. Would you like to order? Yes, two kimchi stews. He can't eat spicy food, so make one less spicy, please. All right. I never told you I like kimchi stew. Or that I'm not good with spicy food. You did. You said you don't remember. Maybe it wasn't you who told me. Hey. I was confused. Yes, it's another guy. Hey! Yes? I like you. So much. I missed you to death. I want to hold you so badly. I want to have sex with you like last time. - You're too wasted now. - Not at all. You won't remember it at all by tomorrow. I do remember. I remember you kissed me first in that tent bar the other night, and that we kissed outside the karaoke. Lower your voice. So I kissed you back. You told me that you lived alone for so long that you can't sleep well next to someone, and you were snoring beside me. Right, and you farted too. Hey! Seongsu-dong Petit Motel, room 302! I got the panties that you left behind. The black one, Venus with laces, size 95! - Thank you. - Take care. ♪ I love you Venus ♪ Why are you running away? I'm not. You're the one who's following me. I've never liked you. You reminded me of myself from the past, so I pitied you. That's why I was nice to you. Out of maternal instinct, you know? It's not that you like me, either. What is it, then? Paternal instinct? An incest? You pretended to be so strong. And now you're busy running away, now that shit hit the fan. Come on, what are you afraid of? Could you please stop and have some guts? How could you be so sure of who I am this quickly? I'm not quite sure about you. What happened with her, by the way? Did you have guts to end that relationship? Go mind your own business. Don't try to boss me around to your advantage. What are you doing? Getting guts. Hello? It's me, Su-jeong. - Give it to me. - Hello? No. - I'll give it back, come on. - She hung up, I'll text her. You wouldn't have done this if you were sober. - Come on, give it to me. - No, I won't. - Are you crazy? - No, I won't... - Give it back. - No passcode? Seriously? - You're being childish. - Childish? Me? - Give me back my phone! - Quit it. - It's my phone. - Let go! It's mine. I just got the guts to text her. - Guts to... - You're so fucking annoying! What was that for? - We're sorry. - What the fuck? What did you do? Sorry. We threw a cell phone... Why would you throw a phone? And why the hell here? I apologize. Is that all you have to say? Look at this scratch. It's damn big. This is my mom's car! I just got it yesterday. It's freshly repainted and everything... DID YOU GET HOME SAFELY? - Good morning. - Good morning. Are you coming to dinner? What dinner? It's a farewell party for Seon-yeong. - Is she coming? - You think? Come by. THIS IS WHERE WE ARE. COME IF YOU WANT TO. Help yourself. Wow, that's a great color. Sorry I'm late. I've been told this is my farewell party? Well, I was drinking near here, and felt sorry to miss it. And I felt the need to talk about things that I couldn't when I was sober. That's what team dinners are like, right? Do you mind if I seat here? - I'll move Yun-ju's purse... - Gosh, sorry. I'm too drunk. This is fun, isn't it? - Pour me a drink, will you? - Pardon? - Did you have a lot to drink? - A little. Want to hear a funny story? When I was little, a boy in my class hit me on my head and ran off. I was so mad and chased him. Then, the teacher told me, "Are you hitting him because he hit you? That makes you the same person as him." All gone. Thanks, here. - Why did you do that? - What? Don't play dumb with me. I just did it because everyone was doing it, so... Gosh. Why are you doing this? I heard you dug around social media for my information, asking people from my last job. That married guy, I'm not the first girl he flirted with. But how come you missed it out when you told them about it? Well, that was because... Have I done anything wrong to you? Seon-yeong. I totally understand why you're doing this, but this is making you the same mean person. Right. But compared to being the victim and make-believing I'm different, becoming the same mean person doesn't seem so bad after all. What? Sorry, I'm too drunk, aren't I? I want to ask something, though. I heard you fell in love with Mr. Seo at first sight in college and kept chasing him around even though he had a girlfriend. And that's why you never got married. That's what I heard. Is it true? No way, isn't it? Of course not, who said that? Nonsense! Is it nonsense? Unbelievable. Byeong-cheol, you idiot! It wasn't me. I just exaggerated a little... No! That's not true at all! Well, that's strange. I mean, I heard stories about gay people or someone being beaten by his wife, or not marrying because of her boss. There's a half-sack here. Who was the half-sack again? Right. Also, there's Ankle Tag who dates a teenage girl who is 12 years younger than him. I mean, seriously, is it really fun to you? It's tough enough without that shit, can't you just cut it out already? By the way, we have a gay guy here? - It's okay, we all know. - What? Me? This is so awkward. What should I do? Seo Gwan-su, you asshole! - Hold on a second. - No! It wasn't me, Mi-yeong! Hold her back! You have no idea how much I like girls! I like girls, I'm not gay... THREE MONTHS LATER Excuse me, have you seen a cat here? A cat? No, I haven't. Thanks for packing my things. I thought you wouldn't call. Can I take her? As you wish. Don't call me, though. You think I will? Stop drinking, too. You think I will? Take care. You take care. So what, did he ask you to marry him? What did you say? Gosh, I dumped him a long time ago. How do I trust a guy who cheated on me? Come on, stop playing hard-to-get. You kids with your foolish love games. In this competitive world where everyone is labeled by their economic status and beating down on each other all the time, why would you want to do that with your lover? Don't try to beat him all the time. Let him win a game or two. These boys today, they give up so fast. - Mom, if they give up that fast... - This is Sparta! What's this? ANIMAL CONDOM I didn't get drunk at all... I just dated him once. - What about you? - Ages ago. How come you don't go home for these cute kids? I told you not to be out here. It's too dangerous at this hour, and the weather is too cold, too. Oh, my. Long time no see. I was wondering how you were doing. I'll buy everything you have left. You'll get sick doing this, then it'll be your children that suffer. Pack them all, please. SEON-YEONG: WHAT'S UP? ARE YOU ASLEEP? Ma'am. I need to... Could you... Here, take this money. Share the corn with your friends, and please go home quickly. You might catch a cold, okay? Don't skip your meals! - And stop drinking! - Okay! Are you drunk? Not too much. Just right. Good. Want to play a game with me? I missed you. I missed you, too.
