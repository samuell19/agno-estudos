You Tube - Video Running Time 02:39:46 You Tube search name - Mahabharata (1965) [French-English subtitles] The great poet VedVyas... be praised VedVyas penned... this epic poem MahaBharat It all happened a long, long time ago. Yet, the story is told again and again. Hastinapur was once a great city... of riches and splendour. The Dynasty of The Moon ruled Hastinapur. King Pandu was much loved by his subjects. This is a story about power. About the tussle for power. You will hear the story of the mighty Bhim and Arjun. And you will hear Draupadi's miseries. This is the story of the struggle for the throne of Bharat (India). That is what MahaBharat is about. The sons of Pandu were Pandav Dhritarashtra's sons were Kaurav Their subjects swore by one, and they hated another. Duryodhan took to the way of sin. And he was jealous of his cousins. Yudhisthir, the eldest Pandav was very righteous. He would never have brother pitted against brother. Lord Krishna's teachings are also enshrined in The MahaBharat. Lord Krishna's teaching are still revered in India. You will hear the story of the mighty Bhim and Arjun. And you will hear Draupadi's miseries. This is the story of the struggle for the throne of Bharat (India). This is the story of the heroes and the legends and land that is India. This is MahaBharat. Bhim, I'm going to smash your mace! Boast not, Duryodhan. Thunder clouds bring no rain. For mothering one as mighty as Duryodhan... your womb must have been blessed, Gandhari. Your son Bhim is no less than my Duryodhan, Kunti. They fight like elephants in musth. They have been trained well by the Lord Preceptor. Your test is done. Now pay your respects to your elders. Bhim! Duryodhan! Will you ignore the command of your Guru? Bhim! Duryodhan! Stop! Else you will burn to ashes in the fires of Guru Dron's anger! - Stop it, I say! - Disengage! Now you will witness Arjun's proficiency in archery. I am certain that no one... can equal Arjun in archery. Lord Preceptor, Dron... You speak in misplaced confidence. - Who are you? - I am Karn. He is Atirath's son. Atirath, the charioteer. I shall not compete with a charioteer's son. - Only a royal can compete. - This is unjust. If he cannot compete with Arjun just because he isn't a royal... then I shall give him the kingdom of Ang. - What says Emperor Dhritarashtra? - I concur. I am grateful to the Emperor and Prince Suyodhan. This favour I shall repay in time. I shall repay with my life. This I vow. May I now have the match? You may, but remember, this is a friendly contest. The sun is about to set. It will be difficult to decide which one of you is better. Glory to the brave Arjuna! Glory to the archer Karn! On this happy occasion, I would like to request Emperor Dhritarashtra... to declare the late Emperor Pandu's son Prince Yudhisthir... our Crown Prince. I respect the wishes of my uncle, Prince Bhishm. Sanjay, have Prince Yudhisthir pronounced Crown Prince. Not as long as Shakuni is alive. - Did you say something, Father? - Silence, you fool! I have told you never to speak during the day! On behalf of Emperor Dhritarashtra, The Lord Protector of Justice... I pronounce Yudhisthir, the Crown Prince of Hastinapur. - To Crown Prince Yudhisthir... - Glory be! - To Emperor Yudhisthir... - Glory be! Mama... (Mama: maternal uncle;mother's brother) Mama, Yudhisthir was proclaimed crown prince. And you spoke not a word? Do you want me and my 100 siblings... to be reduced to beggars? We have nowhere to turn to! Worry not! My ivory dice are loaded in your favour. - Mama! This is ruination! - What happened, Dushasan? My father the king, is having a palace built in Varanavratt! The Pandav brothers and their mother Kunti... are travelling to see the fair in Varanavratt. To cater to their comforts, a palace is being built there... - by the architect Purochan. - If Purochan is the architect... the palace is going to be built just as I want him to build it! Shellac, magnesium and spice oils will be used in the mortar. Sticks of sulfur, phosphorus will be concealed inside the structure. History will name it The Shellac Palace. This palace exudes a fragrance! Purochan, is it? This palace has been constructed for your pleasures, my Lords. - You are a good sculptor. - And wise too. Wisdom is a necessity for ones who deals with the Kaurav. Welcome! Your art is par excellence! A small reward recognition. You are magnanimous, Your Highness. Deign to rest, please. The dark clouds gather. A storm comes. Deign to rest, my Lord. Well, Purochan? A palace fit for The Gods? Mercy! Mercy Lord Bhim! - Forgive me, Bhim! - Be not afraid. You are about to succeed on your mission. You have lit a sacrificial fire. The sacrifice, I shall make. Pleasure be to Agni, The Lord of Fire! Rise! Run! - What gives? - Purochan set the palace on fire! Hurry! The inferno is raging all around. How are we going to escape this? Sahdev, use your knowledge of structures. Tell us, is there a tunnel secreted somewhere? Think hard! There should be a way... somewhere over there. Come on. Uncle Vidur... Thank God that you are alive. Were it not for Sahdev, we would be burnt alive. - Yudhisthir, I had hinted as much. - Sorry, I didn't pay attention. As far as Duryodhan is concerned, all of you are dead. Duryodhan...? Was Duryodhan responsible for this incident? Shakuni bribed Purochan to ensure that... Duryodhan becomes the Crown Prince. I am no warrior unless I have taken revenge for this low cunning. I will pound Hastinapur to rubble! This is no time to put up a display of strength. The enemy is still mighty, powered by wealth. The subjects and the armies still favor them. You and Arjun will have to wait for the opportune. Do we bow before the enemy? We'd rather be destroyed than bow our heads! I'd rather you used discretion. Venture forth in disguise. Make more friends, enlist their help. Vidur is right. Mama, have you heard the good news? The Shellac Palace was gutted. Nothing remains but the remains of the six dead, right? - Isn't it right? - Six Pandavs! But how do you know? What knows not your Mama? Purochan died too. That's just as well. The lone witness vanishes. After the Emperor is done with the last rites for his nephews... we will find reason to celebrate. - Did you not like my performance? - Who are you? Are you a sorceress? - Are you trying to bewitch me? - I'm Hidamba, the cannibal princess. Your masculinity entices me. I have taken you as my husband. What if I refuse? It's my brother Hidamb! He's a ferocious cannibal! He will eat you and your brothers and your mother alive! Are you trying to scare me into submission? Bhim isn't going to fall for any ploy. Run! Run away from here! Look, he's coming! I'm going to have a feast today! My brother is coming! Why don't you run away? Get up! Brother! The cannibal is dead. But you're hurt too. I warned him. My brother was very cruel! - But he wouldn't listen! - That's him. Your son has killed my brother. Now I'm orphaned. - I have no one in this world! - You have us. Then you must ask your son to marry me. What are you saying?! I have already accepted him as my husband. - She's a cannibal! - A woman, nevertheless. And she warned you about Hidamb. This obligation you ought to repay. - This I wish of you, Bhim. - Your wish is my command. Mother... brother... You talked me into this?! Who are you? Quintessentially none, yet all-pervasive. - What do you mean? - You cannot comprehend. - What is your name? - Ghatoth-Kach. - I am the prince of the forests. - Whose son are you? The mighty Bhim. Ghatoth-kach, the son of Bhim...? But Bhim perished in the inferno... Vidur must have helped the Pandav. - What are you thinking. - Nothing. - You happen to be my nephew. - What is your name? Lord Krishna! No wonder you were able to counterr-work my spell. My obeisances, Kaka. (Kaka: paternal uncle;father's brother) - Deign to give me your blessings. - Bless you. None but I may repel your magic. Kaka, where are you going? To attend Draupadi's Swayamvar. (Swayamvar: Contest for suitors) So you will get to eat all the goodies! How about getting some for me too, Kaka? The only thing I ever stole was butter. Nothing else. On behalf of my father, the King of Panchal... I proclaim this before the assembled royals. One who pierces the fish hanging above the rotating wheel... taking aim by the reflection cast upon this trough of oil... him, my sister Draupadi shall wed. Draupadi, here is Sisupal, the King of Chedi. The one who couldn't protect his fiancee Rukmani? You I shall! King Jarasandh. Him I have heard of... the one who colluded with the invaders. - He brought our motherland to shame. - That's what politics is all about. The Crown Prince of Hastinapur, the mighty Duryodhan. - Of the Shellac Palace fame? - And your Lord-to-be! Karn, who is famous for his magnanimity. He may not be allowed to contest. - Why? - Forgive me... but you were born a charioteer's son. I can't marry you. He is the King of Ang. A King by an act of charity? Him I do not consider a King. Had Karn been born of royalty... he would never have accepted your charity. Now I am certain that my daughter will stay a maiden for life! Forgive me, Your Majesty. Fathers are none to decide the fate their daughters beget. What are you waiting for? Step forward! No beggar will take a princess away while we royals look on! Mother! Mother, look what we have brought! You'll be surprised! As always, you will share whatever you have with your brothers. Without as much as a look?! How could you say that? A woman's voice...? Oh what have I said?! Mother, this is Draupadi, your daughter-in-law. Arjun won her hand in the Swayamvar. Oh no! How could I have said such a thing?! I am a woman too! I'd never do this to a woman! - I take my word back. - No, Mother. Words once spoken, cannot be taken back. My sons, in doing what I have said, you will be fulfilling your duty. - But I have committed a sin! - You need not atone. Destiny has spoken in your words. I do not understand what you mean... Simple. In her last life, Draupadi worshipped Lord Shiva. When Lord Shiva appeared before her she iterated her wish five times. Five times, she asked to be given a husband. Lord Shiva was pleased. He said: Your wish is granted In your next lifetime, you will be given five husbands These are the five. Fire consumes all that is unholy, yet fire is never desecrated. So also Draupadi, who was born by the grace of Agni, The Lord of Fire. Forever she shall remain pure. Understand? Now you must do the needful. What...? Rise and perform your duty as befits a soldier. Draupadi belongs not to a hut. Her place is in the palaces in Hastinapur. You must demand what is rightfully yours. Never did I imagine that the dead would rise for a honeymoon! You regret their escape, don't you? As if regretting wasn't enough... Bhishm Pitamah rubs salt into our wounds! (Pitamah: Grandfather) - How come? - He sends Vidur to welcome them! - Purpose being...? - To give Yudhisthir half the empire! Then I shall play my loaded dice! Have nothing to worry. I am thrilled to see you alive! - To Emperor Dhritrashtra... - Glory be! Your Majesty Emperor Dhritarashtra and my Lords, the courtiers... we all know that the Pandav brothers are brave, and they are proud too. Should they rise in arms to claim their share... of the kingdom of their deceased father... Emperor Dhritarashtra would be accused of being unjust. Peace preferable, and thus desirable... that they be given half the Kuru Empire. - Justice would deem so. - Justice I have always endorsed. - My father is justice personified! - Silence, you fool! I accede. The Pandav brothers be given half the Empire. To maintain harmony between the Kaurav and the Pandav... their respective capitals should be far apart. Mama is right. Distance breeds love. The Kauravs have Hastinapur. The Pandav capital should come up in a place where the air is clear... the water fair, the breeze cool and birds sing in sweet melodies. As far as I know, there is only one such place. Khandavprasth. Then to Khandavprasth we concede. Behold our capital, Khandavprasth! Where nature manifests herself in everyday surprises! Imagine a palace of caves! And crags for our thrones! - Granted. But what about courtiers? - We'll have a monkey for a minister. And a lion for our general; an elephant for our treasurer. And a fox for an ambassador! Utopia! - Are you losing heart? - I'm regretting this. This is what we get out of the bargain? I wouldn't dream of getting anything else but venom from the snake. So also from Shakuni Mama. Expect nothing but duplicity. But in the might of my brothers I bestow my faith. Toil and man may even create a heaven on earth. True. Lord Krishna...! You are conscientious, you are brave and you are truthful. By dint of hard work, you may yet create a heaven in Khandavprasth. Heaven is where you are. Here comes Vishwakarma, the architect of The Gods. Lord lndra, the King of The Gods sends me here to build for you... - your capital city and a palace. - The earlier the better. Exotic! Vishwakarma has been inspired by Lord lndra to build this city. Be then the Pandav capital named lndraprasth. - Noble idea, and noble choice of name. - Welcome to lndraprasth. Why, you look pale. Khandavprasth becomes lndraprasth! Jarasandh slain by the Pandav and ninety nine kings liberated! The Pandav assumes oligarchy! And now the Rajsuya Yagna! - Rajsuya Yagna, indeed? - Yes, Mama. They hold sway over all Aryavartya. (Aryavartya: land of the Aryans) They do whatever they wish to! They get whatever they wish for! - Fate favours them greatly. - Which was bound to happen. - They are honest and fair at heart. - Silence, fool! A thousand times... I have told you not to speak during the day! Not fate, Suyodhan. Intrigue is supreme. The intricacy of which lies lost in your games of the dice? Practice hones perfection! Will the Pandav enjoy the fruits of their Rajsuya Yagna? Who knows? Lord Krishna... of the Yadu dynasty cometh... accompanied by his brother Balram... the bearer of the plow. Deign to accept your seat, Lord. May peace reign forever! His Majesty Emperor Yudhisthir may now anoint... the master of ceremonies. Hold! The scum does not deserve to be anointed! Yudhisthir, your choice of master of ceremonies is worst ever! King Sisupal of Chedi, do not try to disrupt this holy ceremony. This is an insult. The insult is what you do to us, inviting us here... to denigrate us in public?! To rub our noses in dirt?! So Sisupal of Chedi is smeared! For this arrogance of yours, I shall teach you a lesson! And I will make sure that the Pandav repent for this mistake of theirs. We repent the mistake of inviting one as great as you are. Mistaken you are indeed! You discard personalities like... Bhishm, Dron, Karn, Dushasan... Duryodhan, Mama Shakuni, Balram... and you choose this cow-herd as your master of ceremonies! This scum! - Peace. - You clown! All you ever did was to sing and dance with milkmaids! Beasts cannot appreciate music. You lowly drover! Do not incite me! Do not invite your death! Do not try to disrupt this holy ritual. Or is it the promise of handsel? Is your mouth watering already? Sisupal speaks such flowery prose! Not flowery prose. It's fire, you coward! - A fire fueled by thoughts of sin. - To be sated only after... you are consumed in the fire! Come down if you dare! I cannot stoop to your levels. You impostor! How dare you talk back to me?! Sisupal has transgressed all limits of decency. - And you are still silent? - I swore to Sisupal's mother... that I would forgive him a hundred trespasses. He's hiding behind words! Coward! Fraud! What are you waiting for? - Five more trespasses. - You call me a trespasser?! You scoundrel! Bastard! Three left, Sisupal. Rascal! Cheat! Cad! Rogue! No more am I bound by my promise to your mother. How did you hurt yourself? Now you must let us leave for Hastinapur. What's the big hurry, Mama? Stay back for a few more days. - We haven't even dined together yet. - But we can't, can we? We cannot partake any foodstuff that contains salt. Silence fool! I've told you not to speak in the day! Say Shakuni Mama, did you like the Palace of lllusions? - Palace of lllusions? - One of the greatest pieces of art! Is that so? Then we must see it. Say what Duryodhan? Sure! Your son Ulup would love it. - Oh yes, father! - Silence! - Arjun, you will guide them. - As you please. Welcome. Goodness! Is this a palace of ghosts?! Silence! I told you not to speak! Why have you stopped? Come in. But it's raining here...? Look, I'm dry. Not a drop of water will fall on you. Step in. Strange! We walked through water! And we're as dry as the lotus. - But Arjun is dry! - Silence! Sure! I'm not talking. Beware! Fire! Is this an illusion too? Watch flowers blossom out of the fire as you step through it. - You expect us to jump into fire? - Do not be apprehensive. Follow me. Fire, in so many colors? Now watch, the fire will die down. And a floral pattern will emerge. This is what you call a twist of fate! Let us move. Father... wonderful! What is inside it? - I've never seen anything as magical! - We'll build ourselves one too. - But where'd we find girls like those? - Silence! Never speak in the day! Shall we...? Excuse me... Your wife is looking very beautiful today! Born of a blind father are blind sons! Wrong! And you will know for sure the day I pay you back for this insult! Did you mind it? I was just joking. - By rubbing salt into his wounds? - Let us leave, Mama. Suyodhan, do not go away. An invitation from Hastinapur. The Emperor wishes to bless us. Prepare for the journey. A grandelusion overcomes our cousins at The Palace of lllusions... - and Suyodhan leaves in anger. - Why? - He walked into the pool. - Draupadi laughed at him. - He thought he was being insulted. - How foolish. Reserve your comments till you know all. Words gouge deeper wounds than arrow or sword. Draupadi comes with us to Hastinapur. She must apologise to Duryodhan. Draupadi's laughter haunts me! Mama! When will you settle the score? Very soon. The ground has been laid. They should be here very soon. - Who...? - The Pandav. You have invited them to a game of dice. - Just let them sit down... - Goodness! Attention... Emperor Yudhisthir cometh... with his mother Kunti, his brothers and Her Majesty Draupadi. Let us welcome the foe. - My obeisances. - May you be happy. - Gandhari... - Kunti, my sister... Welcome. You left after the altercation with your sister-in-law. I regret it. The Princess of Panchal has come to make amends with you. It was just good-hearted sparring, I assure you. I have nothing against her. - At heart, Suyodhan is clean. - Now don't we know that, Mama? - Cousin Suyodhan is not... - What he seems to be! Welcome. - So what are you up to? - Honing my skills. Carrying on with tradition. Say what, Cousin Bhim? - Well-intentioned, I presume? - Only well-intentioned! - Waiting to don your father's mantle? - Only my father is taking too long. Silence, you fool! I told you not to open your mouth in the day! - How about a few rounds, Mama? - You have just arrived. - Take some rest. - Dice is all about leisure. - But it is an evil game. - Here we are to dabble in evil... - at your invitation. - Not mine. Duryodhan's invitation. Duryodhan is all praise about your game. I am incensed! So I thought, why not a few rounds between nephew and uncle? - Then why wait? - We're going to play in public. Accepted. Who plays me? Mama Shakuni. He plays for me. - One playing the other's game? - I wager my wealth. And my kingdom. Play, Mama. The dice favour me. You have lost your kingdom. And your wealth. Mama, ask the Pandav brothers to surrender their jewelry. This is not a game being played. This is ruination! Whatever is being done, is being done at Yudhisthir's instance. - What have you to wager now? - We have lost everything. What have we left? The Princess of Panchal! Mention her, and I will rip your tongue out! One wager with Draupadi... and Yudhisthir could win it all back. - Then I wager her too. - Brother! Cast the dice, Mama. Six! Victory to Shakuni Mama! You've won me this one too! - Enough for me, Mama. - One last game, nephew. The loser will be banished for 12 years. During the 13th year, the loser will live in anonymity. During this year of anonymity, should the loser be identified... the 12-year banishment will begin again. I accept. Cast the dice. We win again! Dushasan, drag that vain woman out! Leave me! Scoundrel! Leave me! See, Princess of Panchal? It is not only the blind who sire the blind. These men who can see, will turn a blind eye to you! No more the Pandav Queen! You are a slave. You belong to the Kaurav! Yudhisthir gambled himself, and his brothers, and he lost. - Then he staked you. - What right to wager... - has the man who has lost himself? - It works either way. When he lost himself he also lost his right over you as his wife. Now we own you. Dushasan, disrobe her. Stay calm! Pitamah, a woman of your family is being insulted in public! Yet you are silent! Lord Prelector Dron! Has loyalty to the Kaurav... destroyed your conscience? You are the men who have started bloodbaths for a woman's honor. Am I not a woman? Speak! Why do you not speak?! No one here to hear your woes. Dushasan, disrobe her, and make her sit on my lap! Duryodhan! I shall smash your hips! Someday I will! This I vow! And you hear me out too, Dushasan! You dragged Draupadi by the hair! Those hands you have used, I shall rip off! And in your blood, I shall rinse her hair! Only after I rinse my hair in his blood, will I plait my hair again! What are you waiting for Dushasan? Disrobe her! Lord! Protect me Lord! Yudhisthir! Bhim! Arjun! Nakul! Sahdev! Have you turned to stone?! Lord Krishna, should you too have fallen silent... then let the skies be rent apart! Then let the Universe collapse! Krishna! Where are you?! - Krishna! Protect a helpless woman! - Pancahali, the wife of five husbands... There she stands disrobed, in Kaurav court... In despereration she cries out to her brother Krishna. Yudhisthir the just emperor, gambles his wife away. The Pandav brothers watches dumbfounded. In lust, the Kaurav sinned. Thus the seed of an apocalypse was sown. He tries and he tires, yet wicked Dushasan... can never reach the end of her dress. Man he is who stands up for the sake of justice. Coward, the man who brings a woman to dishonor. Bring not a woman to dishonor for she is the mother of mankind. The Lord protects womankind. When all had laid down their arms when all had fallen silent... Lord Krishna protected Draupadi in her hour of misery... This is the legend of our land This is the epic of MahaBharat After happiness comes sorrow; and happiness follows again. But the Pandav lived... all their lives in sorrow. The writ of destiny cannot be changed And the best fought of wars are lost. When the Pandav family was banished... everyone was in tears. The righteous Emperor Yudhisthir... thus bereft of his riches Draupadi roams the forest now, Her home, her palaces now gone Not Arjun's bows and arrows... could save the day The mace spelt devastation once Now rests lazing on Bhim's shoulder. Blue sky, a roof for their home. The earth they have for beds Royals once, they now nestle... among the thorns in the wild They carry on, relentlessly When the Pandav family was banished... everyone was in tears. Happiness comes at last. Sorrows of yesteryears forgotten Bhim is bringing a golden lotus for Draupadi. Whom does he meet on his way? He resembles a monkey. But he is mighty. He is mighty Hanuman. What monkey-business is this? This is uncivilised! - Get out of my way. - I'm eating, don't you see? - Take your tail back! - Stay right where you are. - Let me finish stuffing myself first. - I'm going to beat you up! Why are getting angry? Are you hungry? Try some bananas. Sweet bananas. Get your tail out of my way. Else, I'll kill you! Why get worked up over my tail? Just step over my tail. Had stepping over living beings not been taboo... I would've stepped right over you, your tail and all. - Just like Hanuman did. - What's this Hanuman? You don't know the mighty Hanuman? When he went in search of Sita... he jumped over a hundred leagues of the sea. - A hundred leagues over the seas?! - Yes. I am his brother. Bhim. I have been born by his grace, of my mother Kunti. Well all right, now listen to me. I'm old, and I cannot move. You can lift my tail if you wish, and then you can go on your way. You should've said that before. Wipe your sweat, eat some bananas and then you can try again. Who are you? You aren't any ordinary monkey. Please tell me who you are. I am Hanuman. Lord Rama's servant. Forgive me, brother! And bless me. A man needs confidence in his might. But he must not be proud of it. I give you half my might for times... when you may wield your mace. Come war, I shall be Arjun's mascot. Arjun's standard will be named Kapidhwaj Who are you?! The Princess of Panchal! I'm lucky I found you here! - I'll make you my queen! - Let go! The Pandav are beggars! What can they give you? Soundrel! Leave me! Help! Come on, Draupadi, I'll make you my queen! Help! Leave me! That's Jaydrath! Duryodhan's brother-in-law! Enough! Spare him! A scoundrel he is, but you'd make a widow out of an innocent woman. Duryodhan's sister is your cousin! - Spare him, please! - If you say so. But I'll give him his flight of fantasy. Mama, it's time the Pandav family went to live a year in anonymity. We should try to find them. Father! A horse without chariots has fallen out of the sky! - What nonsense...? - I mean a chariot sans horses... - just fell out of the sky. - Where? - In the courtyard. - Come on. - Jaydrath, who did this to you? - Bhim. Bhim...? So where are they now? Let's see you roll out a two. Two? Here... two - Kank you are a pro! - Yet you win, Your Majesty. This is victory for us, Father! Mama Keechak has won the war! Then my son Uttar, you will go and tell your mother... - to give Keechak a rousing welcome! - Yes, father. Cyrindhri, what a lovely hairdo! I'm looking beautiful. - Glory to Queen Sudarshana! - Congratulations, Your Majesty! Mother! Your brother Keechak is the victor! - Really?! - Yes! Cyrindhri, you bring us luck! No sooner than... you step into our household, my brother Keechak wins a war! Your brother after all brave, he must be. Now go and tell Vallabh to lay out a feast. Eating is easier than cooking. Don't you agree? You're eyes are streaming. The smoke? And no smoke without fire. Have you come here to mock me? The Queen wants a 36-course feast laid out today. Why? Anyone dead? Her brother is back after winning a war. - So there's a feast on order. - Will be done. - Like some help with the spices? - Help the Queen with her hairdos. If you touch anything over here the food will reek of aromatic oils. Now begone, and let me do my work. By the way, here's the menu. Puris and Kachoris. Halwa and sweets. 5 kinds of Raita. 50 dishes with Shaak. And the dessert is condensed milk. - Greetings, Brother-in-law. - You have made me proud. Sister! Keechak, my brother! This country is indebted to you! - Who is she? - Cyrindhri. She is my handmaiden. Make sure you send her to me! The ecstasy of beauty! What holds this liquor for me? Why have you shut the door? That I may open my heart to you. Do you realise what you are? You are the elixir of the grape. The wine! And I... I seek your pleasures! Let me drink in your beauty! Come into my arms. You think of woman as an object of desire? Then you have not seen the fire in a woman! What am I doing?! There are only a few days to go... before we're done with life in anonymity. Discretion! When in anger... You look prettier! Like gold! Made pure in fire! You must not speak like this to a servant girl! Not a servant! You are the queen of Kichak's heart! Then tonight I shall come dressed like a queen. To the theater. The dance theater! Why are you crying? Keechak! He grabbed me! Keechak! And you spared him?! Despite the indignation...? Only a few days now, and we will have done our 13 years. Were I to have reacted, I would've been exposed. Discretion, the better part of life. But tonight...! Tonight, he waits for me in the music hall! He awaits his death! Waiting for me...? Yet you hide behind the veil? Cast aside the veil. And smile at me. Oh for that smile through lips parted... Oh for the desire in your eyes! Strange, you are hard-muscled. Possible? Maybe. The sliver of moon comes full circle. Why not the maiden harden? Son of a gun! What is this I hear? - How come your voice thickens? - I'm nervous. Don't be. We're just the two of us here. - Swine! - What did you say? - My dear... - My jasmine blossom! - Blind as a bat! - My eyes thirst for you, my love! Come, quench my thirst! No, do not be shy. No, don't hide that beauty! No, you mustn't put it off. Won't you massage my feet, dearest? Sure! Harder, please! Harder! How hard, my love? I'm in a sweat already. - My Venus! - Adonis! - You're the cook! - Yes. Vallabh. My general is dead. And my cattle robbed. By Duryodhan. Be not anxious, Your Majesty. Brihannala will protect your cattle. You are all praise for Brihannala. Is my son Uttar any less? The prince is still young. He might play with arms. - But he cannot wield a weapon. - You I feed! And you praise others? For this you shall pay! Forgive him! Father! Duryodhan's bandits fled like the deer before Arjun's arrows! What is this I behold?! Brihannala, alias Arjun...? Yes, father. And Kank is Emperor Yudhisthir in disguise. And Vallabh, our cook, is the mighty Bhim! The cowherd is Nakul. And Sahdev is the ostler! And Cyrindhri is Queen Draupadi. The brave may also forgive. Grant me that I do not have to live in fear. King Viraat, in times that bode ill... you were the one who gave us shelter. To you, we are grateful. You have embraced me as a friend. Now embrace me as your kin. - Kin? - Yes. I wish to give away my daughter Princess Uttara in marriage... to the brave Arjun. But the Princess is my disciple. To her, I am like a father. - You may have your wish, King Viraat. - What are you saying?! - Uttara is like a daughter to me. - Arjun's son Abhimanyu... will marry Uttara. Bhishm, Karan, Dron, Dushasan... you have the greatest of soldiers. And you come home after losing a battle? This is regrettable. That he has come back alive even after losing a battle... - is no mean achievement! - Silence! This loss benefits us more than victory. We have identified the Pandav brothers. Now they will have to put in another 13 years. We are mistaken. Sudama says that they have come out in the open... five months and 17 days, after the expiry of 13 years. If that be true, then the Pandav will come back to claim... half the kingdom from me. And when I refuse... they will elicit the support of their friends... - and they will make war on us. - To every attempt of which... - we shall reply in kind. - Before we do that... we must win Krishna over. Arjun... at this time? Is everything all right? - Say, what brings you here? - I was here before him. Prince Suyodhan. What may I do for you? Kaurav and Pandav are going to war. You must support the Kaurav. - Do you know the outcome of war? - Very well. That is why... - I have come to seek your support. - Arjun is younger to you. Being younger to you, he has the first right to ask for any favours. Arjun, I have two things to offer. One, my three legions. And the other, just me. Say, what do you desire? Armies I do not want. I shall not take up arms. What did you say? You won't take up arms? No. Then I will not make Arjun unhappy. You can go over to Arjun's side. - And let me have your armies. - Accepted. Thank you. - Duryodhan has taken everything. - Except you. But I will not join in battle, I have already told you. Then take the reins of my horses. Be my charioteer. So you want me to take the enemy's arrows? No archer can put an arrow in you. The great Himalayas cannot fall. Blind faith? What can the five Pandav brothers not achieve with the help of Krishna? Have you forgotten the sixth Pandav? - The sixth? - Abhimanyu. May the day never dawn upon our nights, Uttara. And tell the Moon.. To stay with us tonight. Lord Krishna cometh. My obeisances to Emperor Dhritrashtra. What comes this beggar asking for? In askance I come not. I am here to give. Yesterday, I gave you my 3 legions. Today I come to give sound sense. Time, let us not waste. Let us talk. I propose a treaty. Give unto the Pandav what is theirs. In their foolishness, they have forfeited what was theirs. And in other words, you cheated them out of it. The perpetrator, you are. Was it I who gambled? Am I to be accused of wagering Draupadi? And Duryodhan was ridiculed as the blind man's son! And I am at fault?! Who was it who built the Shellac Palace? Who was it who invited them to gamble? Who is to blame for disrobing Draupadi? No man will ever point a finger at himself. Go and tell the Pandav to stop dreaming about palaces. - Tell them they'd rather become monks. - Else, let arrows and swords... seal their fate on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Come, make war. War! Do you know the implications of war? Maybe you will cast new light? War destroys countries, war makes ruins of palaces. War makes widows. War breeds epidemics. I have heard enough. Have you anything else to say? Give to the Pandav what is rightfully theirs. Not without war. If not the kingdom, just give them five villages. Five for 5 brothers. Five villages is a lot of land. Not without war shall I cede... even as much land as the tip of a needle will hold. After the war, you might not even have as much left. You may not violate the protocol of the emissary. I came here, an ambassador of peace. But words you make me speak are the words of the archangel of destruction. Far is not the time when... there shall not burn a single lamp in all the palaces of Hastinapur. Ere such times come, your life will have been extinguished! Hold this conspirator! Duryodhan, I have sworn not to take to arms against the Kaurav. And Bhim is sworn to kill you and Dushasan. So I shall spare you this day. Else I would despatch you as I did Sisupal! Sanjay... Be seated here, Your Majesty. On the battlefield are arraigned the warring armies, ready for battle. Arjun rides his chariot... inspecting columns on either side. Lord Krishna, King of Dwarka, is Arjun's charioteer. Krishna...! - This war I shall not fight. - Why? See you not what I behold? Am I to make war on my elders, my kin? Am I to spill the blood of my cousins for lust of kingdom? My grand uncle, Bhishm Pitamah! On his knees I have played. To walk, he taught me! The Lord Prelector Dron! Taught me the art of warfare. Kripacharya, my father's cousin! Shalya, my mother's cousin! Duryodhan and his hundred brothers, my cousins! And these thousands... my kinsmen! Were they born immortals? Never to die? Die they may, but why be I, the cause of their deaths? Because they will it unto themselves to be the cause of your death. No reason of your refusal to take to arms, this war will stop! Will arrows shot, stop short of piercing Yuidhisthir's bosom? Will maces be willed to spare Bhim? And swords scythed to spare you? That done, will Kunti and Draupadi and Subhadra and Uttara... not have to take their lives to protect their honor? If Duryodhan could make passes at Draupadi... Subhadra and Uttara he might even disrobe! Yet vivid in my memory lies etched... your dire warnings to Duryodhan. Not the sin of war shall I allow my life to be tainted with! Nor I want coming generations to speak my name in hatred! You, you are the one who spoke of warmongers as cruel demons! And you... you incite me to make war?! This war is not your making. Duryodhan it is. Cruel he is. The demon is he. Not you. - What of killings at my hand? - To take to arms... to protect oneself, one's rights, to uphold justice and morality... is not being cruel. Courage is what it takes. Will you be rememebered a coward? The cowards and the courageous that is what the world is made up. But for the love of life why should I be committing sin? Death becomes us all. But cowards die a hundred deaths where the hero dies only one. Worthless that life of the worm, cringing, breathing, lived in fear. Live life in dignity. Live to be proud of yourself. Live this life and do your duty. Through these acts will you have lived a fulsome life. In every turn of life, act you will have to. In life and in death act you must. Act then, and you shall have the greatest victories among humans. Do what I command you. For I am cause of action and unto me floweth fruition. I am the Genesis, Apocalypse I am. Witness Witness that I am (The Bhagavad-gita is a chapter of the Mahabharata containing 700 verses.) (The Bhagavad-gita are the instructions given on the battlefield of Kurukshetra...) (by Lord Krishna to Arjuna.) (The text of the Bhagavad-gita are Lord Krishna's instructions.) (The Bhagavad-gita contains the essence of all philosophy.) (The Gita describes Karma, Dharma, and devotion to the Supreme Lord...) (explains the relationship between cause, action, intent and purpose...) (describes techniques of yoga and meditation...) (and devotional service.) (Lord Krishna also explains the significance or real renunciation and devotion.) "Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice," "O descendant of Bharata," "and a predominant rise of irreligion," - "-at that time I descend Myself." - Bhagavad-gita As It Is, 4.7 (For the soul there is never birth nor death.) (On the battlefield of Kurukshetra...) (Lord Krishna urged Arjun to perform his duty as a warrior.) Now nothing can stop my arrows from missing their mark. The world will reverberate to the sound of ricochets from my bow! My obeisances to my elders May victory be yours I cannot see through the maze of arrows! Pitamah Bhishm's arrows! We're going to annihilated! Deign to accept Bhishm's obeisances, Lord. Ones whom you protect, no one can bring to harm. But I would not like to see you recant your promise. My word is infallible. I hold the wheel of a chariot. - I have not taken up any weapon. - Your ways are inexplicable, Lord. In nine days, Pitamah Bhishm has massacred millions of our warriors. - Not any more. - How? Tomorrow Shikhandi leads the Pandav armies. Shikhandi? Shikhandi is a hermaphrodite! He will not touch a eunuch. And you will hide behind Shikhandi and you will use your arrows. - That would be immoral! - And what is moralilty? Your grand uncle casts his lot with the evil Kaurav. Is that moral? When Duryodhan was disrobing me, I begged of him! But justice he would give me not, nor he stood up for his morality! So long as your grand uncle lives, you Pandav can never win this war. For he is blessed with the death wish. But to put him out of action, Shikhandi will have to be used. Amba committed suicide because I would not marry her! In this lifetime, she is Shikhandi, born a hermaphrodite! Born to have her revenge on me... Arjun! Are there no men left in the Pandav army? A eunuch leads your armies? Must be Krishna's ploy! Begin battle! Anyone who can save you from this missile? Arjun, this is your chance. Win this battle... and you've won the war. Shoot. Shoot now. Will someone give me something to rest my head on? What are you waiting for? Go and get pillows. Hurry! Krishna... Would it not be better were this enmity between brethren... to end with my life? I have brought pillows for you, Pitamah. You would not know what kind of a pillow I want. - Arjun, where is he? - Command me, my Lord. My head is hanging. I want a head-rest. - What more do you wish for? - Only death. Until the summer solstice... this body I shall have to preserve. Water! Fetch water! Hurry! Water, Pitamah. Not just water... for the soldier... dying on the battlefield. Sacred waters... the water of the sacred Ganga. Arjun will give me my wish. Arjun, my son... As you wish, my Lord. With the fall of Bhishm... dark days have befallen the Kaurav. And Arjun happens to be the dearest disciple of The Lord Prelector. Him to protect, our Lord will take to arms. Not to kill him. Loyalties misplaced? Surely the preserve of the Lord Prelector solely? This collective insination tests the very limits of my patience! Keep your command of your armies. And here, take my bow and my arrows. Have you taken amiss our fervent prayers? You are the one who can steer us through. You are to us what a twig is to a drowning soul! Yet it is Arjun he loves. More than all of us? Say that not. Or will you accuse me of being partisan? To lay your accusations to rest, I swear that in battle today... one Pandav heavyweight shall surely fall. Arjun is holding his own against seven platoons. Lord Dron has drawn him into a vortex. None of the 4 of us here know the art of penetrating a vortex formation. I know, my Lord. Who taught you? I heard it when I was still in my mother's womb. Once, when my mother Subhadra was having a sleepless night... my father began telling her how to penetrate... the seven layers of the vortex. By the time he reached the 7th... my mother fell asleep. So I didn't get the entire lesson. Not to worry about it. I'll break through the 7th! - Then allow me to ride into battle! - You're still a child, Abhimanyu. Since he has the skill, I vote Abhimanyu our general for the day. And we will be his bodyguards. So be it as you wish. Uttara, I come with good news! First, my good news. I... Tell me. I feel shy! Say... My love, you are going to become a father! Am I glad to hear this! The mother of my son! Now, the ritual to bid me godspeed. Go, get it. This be the luckiest day of my life! This day I ride into battle as the general of the Pandav! What happened to you?! Speak! No! Do not go! I am so afraid! Wish me the best with all your heart. Hurry! Hear! The bugles play! Bid me godspeed! Mother! Bless me mother. Your son has vowed to break through Lord Dron's vortex. - Tears in your eyes, mother? - Tears of joy! Fortunes be mine, and have faith in your son. Your Abhimanyu carries a sword of slaughter... through the enemy ranks! Their shrieks you shall hear here! Fare me well, mother! The Kaurav have mounted... a vortex attack. Today young Abhimanyu... rides into this vortex. Jaydrath, the first rider into the vortex. He falls to Abhimanyu. On first thought, Abhimanyu wanted to kill him. But then he thought killing a fallen foe is immoral. The battle was fought by trickery. It was a sad day. This is the story of a little boy who put up a fight against... seven mighty warriors. This is the story of MahaBharat. There standing front of him was the proud Karn. One arrow from Abhimanyu... and Karn's bow was broken. Dushasan was unseated. He ran for his life. No one could face this volcano of fury. Then came forth... Mama Shakuni. But his art with the dice never paid off. Then there was Shalya, the archer. He too fell like a leaf. Not even Duryodhan would be spared. The boy wanted old scores settled. Then they realised... that the boy could not be tamed. Only a ploy could kill him, they decided. A lone boy, pitted against seven mighty warriors. Yet he fought to the last like a true warrior. Then Duryodhan sang praises of Abhimanyu... and he praised Abhimanyu for his skills. Then Duryodhan expressed his desire to embrace Abhimanyu. This was Duryodhan's ruse. He deceived his nephew on the pretext of embracing him. Abhimanyu was shot in the back. What is the matter? What is up? Why are you silent? What is it? Why do you not speak?! Your Abhimanyu... he died like a hero! Abhimanyu, dead? How? Who killed him?! Into the battle he rode like a lion to pierce the vortex. We tried our best... but we couldn't get to him in time. Jaydrath held us. Abhimanyu! He pierced the The Lord Prelector's cordons? Duryodhan and six of them! They were seven! They closed in for the kill. Jaydrath? So he stood at the mouth of the vortex? Then he is the cause of my son's death! Lord Krishna! Abhimanyu will be avenged! I swear it! Before sunset tomorrow, Jaydrath will be dead! - What if you do not succeed? - Then I shall immolate myself! This I swear too! Lord! Save me Lord! Arjun has sworn to avenge Abhimanyu's death! Before sunset tomorrow, he has vowed to kill me! Arjun is foolish. If he kills you... As soon as your lifeless head falls on the ground, your assasin will die. You have a boon. But that might not be enough to save Jaydrath. How do we save Jaydrath till sunset tomorrow? If he fails, Arjun will immolate himself tomorrow. Help me Lord! Rest assured, Jaydrath. I will hide you till sunset tomorrow. The sun has set. Come out now, Jaydrath. The sun took its time going down today. But I have been lucky. Now let's go and see how fortune favours Arjun. He's about to immolate himself. My son! You should be proud. I am going to keep my vow. And the sooner the better. You went into hiding the whole day like a rat! If the foe is foolish enough to kill himself, why fight? Right, Mama? Wait. Do not forsake your bow. That is the way of the warrior. Right Mama? So the cowherd knows too the ways of warriors? If you insult Lord Krishna, I shall break my word! No Arjun, you must do what you have vowed to. And what will you do? Will you play your flute while Arjun dies? Look... The sun is yet to set. Arjun, fulfill your vow. My obeisances, Lord. I apologize for requesting your presence. But my conscience is troubled... my spirit drained of all strength. - Why? - Had I not lied about... Ashwatthama's death, Dhrishtdyumn could never have beheaded Lord Dron. You said: Ashwatthama has fallen Then Lord Dron had asked you... Ashwatthama, my son? Or the elephant? You said: The elephant Clearly implying thereby that... it was the elephant named Ashwatthama who had fallen. - Not his son. - But just as I was about to speak... you blew on your conch, and you sounded the trumpets. - In the din, he couldn't hear me. - Why should you regret that? It was I who did it. For which, I shall suffer. Another one of those assassins who killed Abhimanyu... will be punished tomorrow. Karn, who was born of The Sun leads the Kaurav armies tomorrow. Glory to Karn, the magnanimous king! Gold I seek not. What is it you seek? Assurance. Today you lead the Kaurav armies. But let not your arrows find their mark on my sons. - My five sons. Assure me that. - Your sons? Who are they? Yudhisthir, Bhim... Arjun, Nakul, Sahdev. So, a beggar you aren't! You are Kunti! Yes, my son! Your mother comes begging to you! My mother you are not. Radha. She is my mother. I am Adhirath's son. They have fostered you. But you, I bore. Then I was a maiden and prospects of the scandal scared me. I gave you up to the Ganga. Adhirath found you. The Sun is your father. Have I lived to see this day?! Never had I imagined this! I was thrown into a river for fear of a scandal! Not even my mother's milk was given me! Now she knows her five sons live in the shadow of death... and here she is, my mother asking for a sacrifice! No! I want no sacrifices! I only seek kindness! Kindness! Kindness is a mother's gift! When her son is born, a mother gives to him... her waking hours, her sleepless nights... and her blood... her milk. The mother's gift. A mother I have failed to be! The biggest failing of a woman's life! Your mother has failed, my son. Should the son fail his mother too? My duty as a son, I will surely do. That'd change the course of the war! The land of the Aryans... will be cleansed of the scourge of the evil Duryodhan! Be he whatever, Duryodhan gives me respect. He has anointed me a monarch! The King of Ang! And you ask me to betray him? All I want is life for my five sons! Speak! Why do you not speak?! Speak Karn, speak! Sun! My Lord! Will I be turned away? No. You have my vow. Five sons you will have. Either I shall die at Arjun's hands. Or him, I shall kill. Five of your sons, you will always have. This day I have eagerly awaited! My arrows thirst for your blood! Then take aim. Bravo Karn! Not a word of praise for me? And all praise for Karn? Krishna sits on your chariot. And Hanuman protects you too. No mean achievement it is to push your chariot back. Remember Karn, you killed my son when he was unarmed! So it is that you shall be slain too! - Shoot Arjun, shoot. - No. It is not just to kill an unarmed man! Losing a war is not just. Victory is the virtue of war. Like Jaydrath, Karn too was involved in slaughtering Abhimanyu. Avenge Abhimanyu! Karn, I avenge Abhimanyu! He was magnanimous. With this very hand, you tried to disrobe Draupadi. Now I shall do what I am vowed to. You have made me so happy! Happy I shall be... the day when I have broken Duryodhan's hips! Are you here with another proposal for a truce... now that I am the only one alive? I have no time for you. I am going to see my mother. - To seek her permission? - No. I do not know why she has called me. - She wants to see me naked. - Naked? Will you go naked?! Now that would be indecent. Take my advice. Cover yourself in a banyan leaf at least. That way, you would have done your mother's bidding. And you will have kept within the limits of decency. After Mama Shakuni, you are the only one who has given me sound advise. - May I be of any other service? - You may leave. Mother, my obeisances. Is that you, Duryodhan? What have you done? Why did you disobey me? - Why have you covered yourself? - It'd be indecent otherwise. - And who gave you that idea? - Krishna. 99 sons of mine, he has already had. And now you! He will kill you. - I do not understand... - But Krishna did. After all these years, I have removed my blindfold. To give you the powers I hold in my eyes. - You would have become invincible! - I feel the surge in my arms! But the parts hidden from my sight will remain weak. Run away from here, my son! Run for your life! Go! - Am I to run like a coward?! - Yes! - No! That can never be! - Your mother begs of you! Your mother commands you! Go! Go away from here! - No! - Begone, I say! Yudhisthir, the just king and all his four brothers... come here to kill me! Five against one! Seven warriors surrounded Abhimanyu. But Bhim alone will fight you, Duryodhan. Come fight me, all five of you! And I will not be scathed! My mother has blessed me! I am invincible! Lord Krishna! To Emperor Yudhisthir - Glory be! For protecting the good... For the destruction of the evil For justice, I shall reincarnate myself in every age to come
