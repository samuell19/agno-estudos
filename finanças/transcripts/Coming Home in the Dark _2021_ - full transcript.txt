Are we going up there? Yeah, no, you are. We're gonna stay down the bottom and have lunch. Hey, don't touch the driver. Yes, there kind of is. No, there's not. OK, they don't hire the prostitutes. It's nothing that I listen to. Yeah. I listen to the old classics. "The old classics"? Playboi Carti is... It's political. It's political. Playboi Carti is not an old classic. I don't listen to him. I listen to the old... It's political. "I don't listen to him." "I don't listen to him." It's just so... You know, they have one song. They're, like, four min-no, It's, like, eight minutes, say. It's pretty. And it just goes... That's so vibe-y. And not in a good way. It's like if you just took... OK, if you look up on the right here, you will see the site that, uh... You passed a speed trap, Hoaggie. What? You passed a speed trap. Oh, shit. They just don't have any talent. Yeah, but if we're talking about lyrics, some people do have lots of talent. Yeah. But that's... In the way they deliver it. Well, they had some. No, but your music is just noise. It's just lots of noise. It's not arranged. It's not in order. It's the same sequence... Excuse me, sir. Do you realize how fast you were going? No, no, no. But to say that their music is bad is different than saying that you don't like their music. I don't like them, and they're just bad. OK, well, you don't know anything about the real world. I'm going to hit that phone out of your hand. No, you're not. Oh, real mature. Hey! Do you think I'm kidding? Hey, how do you, um... Tap to make a jump. All right, there you go. Hey, Hoaggie? No, you've already eaten. Yeah, but it's part of the road trip experience. "The road trip experience..." All right, sure, pass it here. No, no, no, you can just share this one. I'll tell you what, if you can communicate with me in a mature, adult level, I will concede. All right, suit yourself. They're two for $3. 15. A hundred bottles of beer on the wall, a hundred bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around. 99 bottles of beer on the wall. That's not in order. We'll do it in rounds. No, please, no. We'll do it in rounds. Please, no. No, you love that. I hate that. You love that. Let's do rounds. It fascinates me, you know? You get two eggs from the same basket, and one of them is this lovely, gentle, patient boy and the other one's... What? An egg? Yeah. Knock, knock. Who's there? Banana. Banana, who? Knock, knock. Who's there? Banana. Banana, who? Knock, knock. Who's there? Banana. Banana, who? Knock, knock. Who's there? Orange. Orange, who? Orange you glad I didn't say banana? That's just terrible. I don't suck. You do suck, bro. You suck. You suck more. I'm not "who's there." Knock, knock. Who's there? Doctor. Doctor, who? Ah! Hey, I don't want a photo of your bums. OK! OK. 'K, 'K, 'K, 'K, 'K. Go. What are you thinking about? Ah, just work. They just don't have any... You boys enjoying the view? Yeah, it's great. I'm talking about... Jenny's still giving me the third degree. Oh, the Coromandel thing, the shared batch thing. I want the boys to have a place to spend their summers with a sense of community. We're OK with not having that. Yeah, I'm personally not craving a sense of community. And what about the obligatory committee meetings the politics, the passive aggression? Alan. No, I'm serious. I had to organize a fundraiser with Jenny and it was impossible. I got so angry... Alan. Well, I almost said something. Can we help you? This is nice. Very nice. Is this a family picnic, man? I should probably introduce myself, shouldn't I? I'm Mandrake. And you are...? Oh, I'm... I'm Alan and this is my wife Jill. G'day, Alan. G'day, Jill. Who you got there? Thompson and Thompson? Um, this is Jordan, and Maika. Hey, boys. Oof. Far out, eh? Got the whole place to yourselves. Privacy is a strange thing, isn't it, eh? I mean, here we are a world apart, yet even as we speak, we got internet, radio waves running right through us. Nah, I can't hear anything out this way. Mom... It's OK, Maika. They can't hear us. And we can't hear them. They got no idea we're even alive. See you're curious about the gun. Do you boys want to take a look at it? You stay away from... Tut-tut-tut-tut, dad. No need to get jumpy there, mate. Just trying to make conversation. Why don't you sit down, dad? Mom... Maika, look at me. It's OK. You just stay there. You're all right. Good on you, mum. As long as everyone does as they're told, this will all be over in no time, eh? What do you want? Well, thank you so much for asking me, Jill. I take it that fine family vehicle I saw just over the bridge there belongs to you lot. GPS, three tiered seating, those fancy little cup holders. Here, just take it. Just please... Well, thank you so much. Would you mind turning out your pockets while you're at it? Beautiful. Yeah, I'm no mathematician but, um... We made him leave his phone at home. He's still grounded, technically. That's probably very wise, dad. You gotta teach 'em to respect you before they can respect themselves. All right, if you could just all pop yourselves down on the blanket over there, heads facing that way, that'd be much appreciated. In your own time. Boys, just come here. Do exactly what he says, OK? Come on. Let's just do what you're told, OK? OK, we're gonna head off. Don't turn around now. It's OK. Come on. Hoaggie. What was that? What'd you say? It's just... What? No, just... Hey, what'd you say? They call me... It's just a nickname. What's the nickname? Hoaggie. Hoaggenraad. Am I pronouncing it correctly, Hoaggenraad? Yeah, that's-that's right. Can't be too many of those around. It's Dutch. Interesting name. Yeah, as interesting as Mandrake? I'm a magician. I make things disappear. Let me look at you. Hey? Hoaggenraad. Hoaggie! I like it. I like Hoaggie. It's friendly. And, um, yeah, actually I know a Hoaggie. Where do I know the name Hoaggie from? Oh, I don't know. Yeah, come on, you must know, man. I really don't. Come on. I usually have such a good memory for this stuff, too. Jill, where do I know Hoaggie from? I'm not sure. Hey, Tubs, mate, where have I heard the name Hoaggie from before? I know it's... Ah, come on, Hoaggie. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Hey. Got company. All right, everybody up. Everybody up. Come on. Up, up, up, up, up, up. No, no, no, no, no! Sh, sh, sh. Up, up, up. Up, up. Get up. Good boy. All right, everybody. Play at happy campers, there. Happy campers. Mom. Eyes on them, mate. Okay, let's not be rude. Everybody give 'em a wave. Give 'em a wave. Don't be rude. You know, later on, when you're looking back at this occasion... I think that right there is going to be the moment you wish you had done something. What the fuck have you done?! What the fuck have you done?! When the sun goes down, we'll make a move. Getting cold. Yes, but tonight we don't have to be out in it, do we? Which makes a nice change. Tell you what, why don't you go, um, take those kids, put 'em somewhere. Food's not going anywhere. Don't suppose you've got any booze, do you, old son? Ah. No? Jill? What a pity. Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you all! Fuck you... You just never, never, never, never, never know where the day is gonna take you, eh? Hoaggie? You see, I didn't wake up this morning thinking, "Oh, this is where I'll be by this evening," and yet here we are. What've we got here... "Jill Marama Booth ." Fascinating. Kept her name. Bit bloody modern, don't you reckon? You better kill me really quickly because I'm gonna fucking kill you. Yeah, I reckon I might drive for a little bit, eh? Why don't you, uh, sit in the back with Hoaggie? Just thought of a change of plans. A quick detour. Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. Shh. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Yeah, I can live with this. All right. Let's buckle up, everyone. Where are you taking us? Home. It's a damn shame. It is amazing how just a little bit of music can lighten the mood. How's the philosophy, old son? I'm guessing you probably wouldn't know it to look at me, but I'm actually a bit of a sort of sucker when it comes to reading. Reckon I would have done all right at university, too, if things had been different. You know, not to knock your profession, but... I just think that every lesson you can be taught will occur in the course of your life anyway, you know? Something I've been sitting on for a while. I want to get your take on it. Not safe to leave a driver alone to his thoughts, Hoaggie. "Not to knock my profession ." Is that a question? I didn't tell you I was a teacher. You are a teacher though, right? Pretty certain you told me at some point. But you're probably having a bit of trouble remembering, you know? The shock of it all. Dirt. No. Dark. No. Dust. Same as dirt. Desert. No. No, come on. Um, ta, ta. Um, driver? Me? No. No? I give up. Distance. Eh? Distance. Yeah, no, I heard you the first time, Tubs. I don't think that's... That's a bit bloody abstract, mate. I don't think it's allowed, if I'm being honest. You wouldn't be saying that if you'd figured it out. Where are the boys? I'll get us through this. I promise, I'll... Oh no. I'll get us... I'll get us through this, I promise. Ah! Come on, Jill, it's better this way. Yeah, shh. You know how boys can be. They'd have gotten in the way. And at least they didn't have to suffer, you know? Not really, not like some. Shh. Look at it like this, Jill. The worst has happened. You're a fucking murderer! Shh. As opposed to what now? A fucking accountant? Shh. Shh. Who's next? Who is next? Who's got one, eh? Come on. Jill, what about you? Come on, I Spy. No, this isn't happening. I hate to disappoint you, love. I spy with my little eye... Leave her alone! Something beginning with... F, F. I'll play. Just just... I spy... For fuck's sake! With my little eye something beginning... I spy with my little eye something beginning with F. Fence. Fence. Yes. Shh. Well, that was easy. Shh. Shh. Good on ya, mate. Hmm? No, mate. Absolutely not. Tubs and I recently had an unfortunate experience with a Mercedes. Don't think we had time to get used to it, did we? So, the owner of the Merc? Surprisingly narrow taste in music. Can you believe that he had one CD in his whole glove box? One. You always do what you're told? You know what, Jill? I feel a bit bloody rotten about this, but I haven't actually asked you what you do for a living. You know? We covered real ground here with Hoaggie. So what is it that you do? She's a teacher. I was asking Jill. She doesn't want to talk to you so I'm talking to you. Same school? Different school? Same school. Hoaggie, could you please just give your wife a chance to respond, thank you? That's a noble profession, Jill. Nurturing the minds of the nation's youth together. A teaching couple. Well, is it primary? Secondary? Secondary. Oh, same age as your boys. How long have you been working there... Where did you say you worked? We didn't. Wellington College. How long you been there? She's been there five years. I've been there six. And where were you before that? I was at Scots College. And how long were you at Scots for? Fuck, I don't know... But it wasn't the first place that you worked, was it? No, it wasn't the first place I worked at. OK, so where were you before that? I was at Horowhenua College. And where were you before that? Before that I was at teacher's college. Before that? Before that... I was fucking nobody. And before that? All right. Ok, then. What's that, man? When were you there? When was I where? Hakawai Point. Hakawai Point... Oh, that's the, um... That's that boy's home that's... Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, a bit rough some of those places though, ain't they? So I hear. Oh, but you were there? No, it was just a training stint, you know, in the schoolhouse. I was in and out. Oh, yeah, in and out. Yeah, I didn't see anything. What would you have seen if you were? Well, it doesn't bear mentioning, does it? Hey, Tubs, you spent a bit of time at Hakawai Point, didn't you, mate? Did you enjoy your time there, Tubs? Eh? I was there in 1988. It was before his time. Actually, you know what? Uh, yeah, Hakawai Point was, um... Tubs, was-It's the place where what's-his-face come from, um... Rudy Bocock, you know? He knocked over that RSA. You know, he beat a bunch of senior citizens to death with a cricket bat or something. It was around Foxton ways, eh? Glen Lecky was a right asshole, too, and he was from there. And Mark Sitko. No, wait, Mark Sitko was at Epuni. Any of these names ring a bell for you, Hoaggie? Like I said, it was a long time ago. Yeah, most of these guys have been on the national news at one time or another. And believe it or not, not everyone who went there turned into a fucking psychopath. We were actually helping kids. How'd you get the help that you needed while you were there, Tubs? What wing were you in? Uh, what's it? You know, at the home. Well, what makes you think that I... Oh, just cut the shit. No, do I look familiar to you? People do say I have one of those faces. It was a long time ago. I was... What are you fucking talking about? This is fucking pointless. Yes, practically, yes. "Practically." What, you think he was one of those thugs that abused kids? So all of this is some kind of fucking grudge? I hope you got raped. I need to go to the... Can't hear. Open up. What's that, Hoaggie? I need to go to the toilet. You go on the side of the road. There's no paper. We'll get you paper. I'll shit myself. So shit yourself. Well, I guess if you're happy living with the stench... Go on, then. You going far? Oh, never far enough, mate. Those homes were no kind of a place for kids. No one deserves... No one deserves that. Where did you leave them? My boys. Where did you leave them? You shouldn't have left them out there alone. Bit of a rough one. Safe travels. You're, uh, out of toilet paper in there. Thanks. You been in the war since this morning? I was a bit too keen to get off the track and I tripped on a bloody root. It's not-not so bad. No. Try again. That's not what happened, Hoaggie. Tell him what happened. Go on. Go on. I, uh... I got a fright. I was frightened by... By a goat. Fell down the bank. Bit embarrassed, really. What's going on? I just hit my arm. Get in the fucking car, Hoaggie. Smokes. What's he... Ahh! Oh, God. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Go! Go! You little cunt! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Ah! Help! Ahh! No! No! No! Ah! Would you be so kind as to pass that to Hoaggie? Go on and pin it to your shirt, Hoaggie. My husband didn't do those things. My husband wasn't one of them. One of who? What? One of those... One of the bad men? Yeah. Oh, yes, he's a good man. Yeah. You married a good man. Yes, I did. Good father you've chosen. Yes. Jill, he's just trying to... Yes, yes, you sick fuck! OK, clearly, clearly you've got an issue with me, yeah? You've got some idea about me. And that's fine. You can do whatever you want to me. But just-please just let her go. She hasn't done anything to you, right? We're in the middle of nowhere. You can let her go. You can tie her up and leave her on the side of the road. And I will play along. I will be whatever you want me to be. But just please let her go. Alan. No, no, no, no, no, look. You've got me. Right? You found me. She hasn't done anything. Didn't find you. Weren't looking for you. No, I mean, this is business as usual. It's the next meal. It's the next car, isn't it, Tubs, you know? It's just a happy coincidence. And there's a whole other scenario where a couple of backpackers go missing and Tubs and I and I get to go to bed early. Hey, hey, hey. Get the fuck out. Get out! Jill! You son of... Fuck off! No! Fuck off! Jill! Jill! Jill! Ahh! Now, don't get me wrong. I'll talk all night. But I suspect Tubs is keen-as to get to a pub. Oh, that's fair enough. You don't ask for much, do you, Tubs? No, please. "No, please." I... Fuck you! Fuck you! Ah, ah, ah, ah. Language, please, Jill. "No, please," what, Hoaggie? I don't know what... Hoaggie, you've gotta stop stuttering here, mate. Sooner or later you gotta make a clear, concise point. I don't know what you want me to say! This is the funny thing, eh? You can't just teach people what they need. No, no, no, you gotta lead people to that realization. Would you agree there, Jill? Please don't hurt her. Don't hurt her? Just don't hurt her. I don't want you to... All right. All right. I saw things. Is that-Is that what you want? I was at the home. I saw things. Alan, don't! No, no, no, Jill. No, Jill, you need to listen to Hoaggie right now. He's opening up to us. I don't know what you want me to say! Well, you said you saw things, mate. That's all a bit vague for me. Locker treatments! Locker treatments! The housemasters called them "locker treatments." They would hold the kid's head in the locker and they would beat them with a leather belt. Tell Jill that. And then they would put the kids in the cells and lock them in there for days sometimes. And, and there was a bloke who would make the boys fight each other. And there was a nightwatchman, Ben Creely, he got fired for... For going into the boys beds. I don't want to talk about a kid-fucker! Why did you bring him up? Did you fuck kids? No, no, no. Well, then why'd you bring him up?! Just tell me what you want. I want you to talk about you. They hit kids. You know, I saw guys hitting kids with clipboards when they were on-line. What's on-line, Hoaggie? What's on-line? It's a... It was a... It was a procedure. It was-it was a roll call. You know, they'd line the kids up on the-on the four-square court, you know, the three lines. Did you ever take the kids on-line? No, I never. Are you sure about that? I was an assistant teacher. Are you absolutely sure about that, Hoaggie? Yeah, there was one. There was one time. Yeah, I wouldn't usually... I wouldn't usually, but they were understaffed. And that they got me to help with the roll call. Shit. Shit. There was... There was a boy. He would have been about eight... Eight or nine years old and he'd given himself a tattoo of a swastika on his arm. You know, on the underside of his forearm. He'd-he'd done it himself in his room with a needle and some pen ink. And one of the housemasters, um... Freiberg. His name... His name was Tim Freiberg. He had the kids on-line and the kid with the tattoo was... He was small so he was at the front of the line. And Freiberg saw the tattoo and he got the kid to step forward. And he-he got one of the other housemasters to go and get a wire brush. You know, like the ones you use to scrub the grills in the kitchen. And he handed the wire brush to the kid he said, "Scrub that off." You know, "I want you to scrub off that swastika tattoo." And the kid didn't want to do it. He refused. And so-so-so Freiberg got one of the young housemasters to hold the boy, and he did it himself. He grabbed him by the arm and he started... He started scrubbing at the skin. And the-the boy was... The boy was screaming and the other boys were crying. And Freiberg, he was scrubbing and scrubbing him. And I-I just stood there and watched. Hey. I just stood there... I mean, what could I do? It wasn't my place. It wasn't my place. It just wasn't my place. What could I have done? What could I have done? What could you have done? It was 30 fucking years ago. It's in the past. Let's just leave it in the past. Jill... Good story. Visceral. You know, lots of details. That is the most important thing about a story. It's the details. Except it wasn't a wire brush. It was nylon. Still did the trick, just took three times longer. See, you know what? It's the capacity to get to the core things, Hoaggie, you know? Just strip away that old self-deceit. It's what's important. All right. Look, you got what you want. Just let her go, please. Please just... just let her go. Let-Let her go. Let her go. Oh, look at those stars. I remember... Ah, years ago now... I spent a few weeks out at Hokianga. Some nights after we'd had a few, we'd take this little thingie out into the water, sit there, talk, watch the lights of Rawene down the harbor, just smoking it up, you know? Lie back, rocked by the swell. Always seems to me like the sky is so much closer when you're out on the water. Mom... Mom... Jill... What do you think, Jill? Does it look any different out there to you? From when you were coming up? I always knew there was something. I could see it in your eyes. I could see you go back there. There is a difference between doing something and letting it happen. There has to be. They live on the same street though. Just wish you had told me. Satisfied? I'm getting there. Why don't you go fuck yourself? Jill! Jill, Jill, Jill. Get up. Jill, just get up! Ahh! Jill, just get up! Get up. Get up. Jill? Don't, don't, don't don't, don't! Well, she had spirit. I'll give her that. I see why you married her. I mean, a... Even a good audiobook wouldn't go amiss. Eh? Shit. "I ought to be like him, but I am rather the fallen angel ." You ever read "Frankenstein," Hoaggie? Let me guess. You identified with the Monster. Yeah, of course you did. You misunderstood the story, you fucking idiot. I didn't make you. Oh, there we go. Aw, come on. Aw, shit... Open the boot, mate. Maybe you should call the AA. Ugh... Oh! Ahh! Is everything all right? Good. You all right? Ah, yeah. Everything is fine, mate. Went a bit tits-up, eh? Yeah, we got a spare. Yeah, so good to go. Yeah, well, thanks for stopping, eh? Jesus! Fuck! Jesus Christ... Ahh! Tubs! Fucking fix it. Fix it! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! There's two men. They've got a gun. They... They killed... They killed people. We gotta get out of here straight away. We need to get out of here. Do I look like I'm fucking having a laugh? Fuck off! I don't have time... I don't have time for your posturing bullshit, OK? You're a tough guy, I get it. You've made your point. Now let me in the fucking car. Walk away. What the... Oi, you! What the fuck? Get out of the car! Fucking get off... Oi! Shit... Get in the car. Get in the car! Come on. Get in. Fuck. Evening. Oh, shit! Drive, just drive. Just drive. Shut it off! That's one option. Go. Shut the fuck up. Go. Go. Just drive. Shut up! Drive. Or you can hear me out. Hear me out. How many you got in there, mate? What do you want? Just drive. Just drive. Just dispensing a bit of local justice, man. Don't listen to him. What's your name? No. Kynan. No, no, don't talk to him, mate. Just don't talk to him. OK, Kynan. I mean, I don't have time to spin you the whole yarn, but that's a bad, bad man you got in the backseat of your car there. No, that's bullshit, man. That's bullshit. You don't want to know the kind of shit that happens to kids when this guy is around. I didn't do any of that. I didn't do any of that! Don't try and split hairs, man. Me being in the car with you here now is the only thing keeping you alive. Oh, you don't give a shit about these kids. Jesus fucking Christ. Hey, you don't know this man and you don't know what he's done. Just go. Just-just-just... just go. Just drive, you stupid fucking cunt. What's the best thing to do here, Kynan? Stay in the car. Stay in the car. Boy, all you gotta do is walk away. Shit... No, no, no, don't do this. Don't do this. Don't do this. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Don't do this. Don't do this. Oh, no! Don't do this. No. Thank you for your understanding. No! Boom. Yeah, that's right. Good boy. I know you. Boy's home, halfway house, prison. You feel at home in a cage. Oh, you think you're a free man, eh? Still on a leash, eh? One more stop. Then pub. I spy with my little eye... Come on, old son. Tubs will help you. What you doin'? Eh? Fuck me. Suit yourself. All right, Hoaggie. Let's get you on-line. Ah, my head. What are the chances, you think, of us meeting like we did? Well, it's a small country, mate. You took us in, you spit us out at seventeen. Where do you think we go? Up until tonight, I'd always... Always ask myself why I didn't do something, why I was such a coward. It's not right, you know, blaming it on cowardice. Because the truth of the matter is I just... I just thought you deserved it. I should have helped. I should have helped you. What do you mean, you should have helped me? Well, you... You-you... You were the... You. If it wasn't me, it was some other kid. We're all the same to you. You're all the same to us. Come on, now. No need to drag this out any longer, you know? Ahh! Where are you going, Hoaggie? You got me. None of you cunts have got me, eh? None of yous, none of yous have got me. Because I reckon it's... Ugh... Fuck off. Nearly done. Cheeky little bastard. Cheeky old bastard, old fuck. Stuff... That's the stuff... Didn't you reckon... I hate this place.
