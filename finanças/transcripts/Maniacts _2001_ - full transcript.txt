(opera music) (singing in foreign language) (knocking on door) - Got a complaint sir, about that odor. You got a rat problem, maybe? - No, only one left. - We need to speak to your mother. - Your landlady asked us to check. - Oh, maybe I better catch that last rat, then everything will be okay. - We have to make everything right tonight, sir. Right now. - No! (furniture clattering) (opera music) (singing in foreign language) (door buzzing) (inmates shouting) - I'm the attorney for the suspect's mother, Henry Barton. - District Attorney Ben Rogers, and he's no suspect, Counsellor, he's it. - Joseph has never needed an attorney. Without his mother, he's just a helpless child. Hello Joseph, it's me, Henry. Remember? I'm so sorry to hear about your mother. (Joe grunting) (Henry groaning) - The last rat. I got it. (upbeat music) - [Announcer] Inmates are reminded they must provide urine samples twice a day. Inmates not providing urine samples will be manually dosed. - Halt! - We remind you-- - Stand right there. - It is not pleasant to be manually dosed. - Hey, hey, Rick Morris here man, everybody calls me Jumpy. Nice to meet you. If you keep looking at my sister, I will kill you, man. You hear me? - Is your sister here? - He wasted his sister, along with his entire family. Now, pay attention! You're now residents of Ward 7 Block 16 of the Edgemare Asylum for the Criminally Insane. Edgemare is a private, State and Federally authorized facility for the incarceration of violent felons deemed too helpless to be housed with the general prisoners. Let's cut to the chase here, okay? You're both so fucked up, we're the only people who would take you, got it? - Right. That makes sense, right? - Shut up! Now, let me direct your attention to your electronic restraint devices on your left ankles. Please note the yellow lines and signs throughout the facility. Remain in these yellow areas or these devices will go into incapacitation mode. I will now demonstrate incapacitation mode. (electronic buzzing) (Joe groaning) Tampering of any sort will also initiate incapacitation. (laughs) That's a warning. (Jumpy groans) Let's go. - Did you put this thing on my leg? - I didn't do it. - Okay. I'm keeping my eye on you. - I said shut up. Move it. Right there, stop. Okay, so there are six basic types of therapy here at Edgemare. Group, electro, chemical, hydro, isolation, and guard. This is group therapy, where you will meet with counselors four times a week to lie about what you did and why you did it. You don't want to experience the other ones, you won't survive. Okay? Next on our little tour, right this way. (electricity buzzing) - Incapacitation mode is not pleasant and may result in-- - Well. - Permanent disability or death. - You learn quick, for an idiot. Okay, this is your personal welcome from our founder and director, Doctor Denton Speck, DPM. Keep your mouth shut. And smile, freak. Have a seat. One at a time. You're first, whoopee. - I-- - Shut up and walk. (door buzzing) - [Jumpy] You gotta see the man. - [Announcer] Inmates are reminded that any tampering with restraint devices will initiate incapacitation mode. We remind you that incapacitation mode is not pleasant and may result in permanent disability or death. - Hey, psst, psst, psst! You see this? Barcodes every 18 inches. Transponders ever 36. Every inch that goes out, I know about it. Every inch that's used, I know where it is. Why? Because it's mine, man, it's mine! (laughs) Eh! I invented it. Five bucks per hundred feet, five cents of every dollar goes right here. Now, do you know how many crime scenes there are in the world? Whoo whoo, cha-ching! - [Estelle] When did this happen, Carr? - [Carr] I don't know Matron, um, last night? - When was she fed last? - I don't know Matron, this morning? - If she was dead and eating this morning, I would like to meet the miracle worker on my staff who fed her. You! What are you gaping at? Get out of my sight, scum bag, and keep your mouth shut. Wait a minute. This is the new one, right Carr? The one who killed nice, important people. - Yeah, he's the one. The Blueblood Killer, they called him. - Well, what's her name was a nice, important person, wasn't she? (ominous music) - [Announcer] Inmates are reminded that all areas outside of Edgemare Institute are red zones and will cause your restraint devices to initiate incapacitation mode. We remind you that incapacitation mode is not pleasant and may result in permanent disability or death. (punch thudding) (Joe grunting) - I will now demonstrate guard therapy. (Joe groaning) Let's go freak. The doctor is waiting. - You know, you really shouldn't wander around here on your first day, Joseph. Or any day, actually. It's not good for your state of mind. Not good, wandering about. Okay? - Maybe I should just leave. - Huh, humor, how refreshing. Six homicide convictions, some of your state's most outstanding citizens. Of course if you had been around here, I might be one of your victims. I plan to be Governor one day soon. Do you know what the state does to people who do things as wrong as this, Joseph? - No, sir. - Well, let's just say people turn up dead here all the time. Make the best of your stay. Questions? - This concludes your orientation. (eerie music) - How long have you had this feeling? - Always. Forever. (sobs) - Oh God. - Even after you killed 'em? - Especially then. - We encourage participation here, Joseph, but we do ask that it be positive and productive. - I think we can positively be productive by cutting down on all the bullshit. It was Mommy's fault, it was Daddy's fault, it was the Devil's fault, it was society's fault, it was the CIA, it was the FBI, it was the IRA-- (many talking at once) I'm here because I'm crazy. You're crazy, he's crazy, she's crazy. Everybody is crazy, we're all crazy. - No! Quiet down, quiet everybody! We have enough sedative to go around for everyone. (all murmuring) Now, Joseph, Joseph, Joseph. (Joe groaning) We don't allow that word here. (ominous music) (door buzzing) (Joe grunts) - [Mason] Watch the fucking language next time. - What did I say? - You used the word crazy. That's a no no. Insane, nuts, retard, psycho, maniac, you get the idea? - [Joe] Yeah. - Find another way to express yourself. - That sounds like a good idea. - [Announcer] Inmates are reminded they must provide urine samples twice a day. Inmates not providing urine samples will be manually dosed. We remind you, it is not pleasant to be manually dosed. (somber music) - Now, isn't this nice? I thought we'd take advantage of this lovely weather and have our session outside today. Now, I thought we'd get started by... I thought we'd get started... What is the matter with you all? If being outside... (screams) (ethereal music) - Oh! (counselor screams) (gasps) (lively music) (people shouting) - [Joe] I'm just hanging around! (door buzzing) (door thunking) - Jesus man. What is wrong with you? (Joe chuckles) Put your fucking scrubs on. - [Joe] Yeah. - [Mason] Hey, let's you and me call a truce. - Truce? - A truce. You stop doing what you've been doing. They'll stop doing what they've been doing, for now. How's that? - I like doing what I'm doing. It stops me from going crazy. - How about not going to the grave yard, man? Listen, all you have to do is to concentrate on something else for a while. That's all. - You mean, like reading a book or something? - Or something. - Hey, hey, hey. Hey, what are you doing? - No, no, we got rules. - This is my room! Spinelli! - I live here. - We have a truce, a truce. (serene music) - Hey. (chuckles) Mason says you don't get any visitors, you needed some, so I volunteered. I'm Elizabeth. I was named after the Queen of England, Queen Elizabeth. You can call me Beth. Right. Huh. Moody type, huh? (whistles) In that case, you can call me later. - Cat Daddy. Mister Suave. Mister Sophistication. (somber music) - [Announcer] The residents-- (Announcer echoing) (Joe humming) - Hairy Kitty. No. Harry Carey. No. Shut up. - [Beth] Harry Carey was an actor. It's called Hari Kari. - Yeah. That's the way to have a good death, no matter how bad you were in your life. - I get it, very useful around here. - Yeah, exactly. - So, next? - I will now demonstrate. (popping) (all shouting) (patients screaming) (Beth laughing) (Joe farting) - Oh, oh, excellent. Let's see, hot water bottle, uh huh. And, hold on, Heinz 57, Kraft Italian, and ah, 7 Up? - No, it's Schweppes. That fizzes more. - Schweppes, right. (laughs) Come on back here you crack pots, and show your appreciation. We have an artist at work here. (laughs) - Uh oh, time to go. - Oh, hey. Hey. (Joe grunts) - Did you really like it? - Yeah. Hey. - Bye. - [Beth] Bravo! Bravo! Hah, bravo! (Joe groaning) (electricity buzzing) - Oh my. You better keep him inside until these heal. All I need is for one of those federal investigators to see this and my future's in the goddamned toilet. Joseph, Joseph, Joseph, do you have one good thing to say for yourself? - I feel fully charged, sir. (lively music) - These people will kill you, Joe. Believe me. You've got to control these, creative impulses for a while, at least until you recover. All right? - Till I get over the shock? - I'll call you back. Who's the victim this time? - Spinelli. - Murderer of six, probably more. - It was up to a judge and jury to put him to death, not us. - Is he dead? - No, but-- - Is he dying? - I think so. - I'm a little vague on your medical qualifications, Mason? - I ain't no doctor, you know that. - But, breaking, entering, and narcotics, those you know, correct? - That was a long time ago. - But negligent homicide, that's much more recent, isn't it? - Yeah, I let it happen, that was my first mistake, and I didn't file any paperwork when I saw it coming. That was my second. Now I know better. - Get him to stop these outbursts until after our next inspection, or he's mulch for my cactus garden. - You are all heart, ma'am. (ominous music) - Oh Queen Elizabeth. Hitch hiker. It's that girl. (romantic music) I'm not saying you don't believe me, I'm just saying that I'm pretty strong, and I never broke anybody's neck. - Yeah. So, what are you worried about? You're gonna learn something here. - I don't wanna do this. - Excuse us a second. Sit down. Come on. Good. - I don't wanna do this. - Go. (Beth groans) - See? I'm pretty strong. - All right. This is gonna be great. (laughs) Okay, ready? Okay now, hit me. - What? - Would you hit me, slap me or something? - No, I don't want to. - Would you hit me? - Why? - (sighs) To learn something. Come on tough guy, pretty please? - I don't want to. - What's the matter, Blueblood Killer, huh? - Why did you do that? - What's the matter, sissy? You scared of me? (patients gasping) (patients laughing) (ominous music) You feel that? Adrenalin they call it. Piss me off, and it's like a dam breaks inside. It's interesting, huh? I can beat God arm wrestling when I'm like this. (Beth growls) (Joe screams) (patients gasping) (lively music) (Beth laughing) Whoo! We have something they will never have! They'll never understand! (Beth groans) (doctor grunts) (Beth breathing heavily) - I'll see you later. - Here. - All right. - Yeah? - Yeah. Hey, and (mumbles) off the floor. (patient shouting) (serene music) - Go ahead, man. - Hey. - Hi. - Oh, gee, how's your arm? - It's okay. I'll be able to arm wrestle again. - All right, it's a date. (chuckles) Take a load off. - Oh, they gave you the treatment. - I love the smell of electricity in the morning, smells like, breakfast. It's "Apocalypse Now", the movie. - Oh. How come you're not mad? - What for? You're here, got my health, three squares a day. Things are pretty good, actually. - They burnt you, and they got you all tied up. - Ah, it's just a temporary condition. You and me, we can't afford to be pissed off all the time. You've seen what I'm like. (Joe grunts) I bet you're no baby either. (Joe groans) Yeah. (Beth laughs) You and me, we need to have perspective on things. - Perspective? - Like, this one damn near breaks your arm off for no good reason. Instead of getting pissed off at them, you visit them in the hospital. It takes perspective. - I like the feel of a broken arm in the morning. (both laughing) - Shush! - Joe, I have to ask you something, okay? You're the Blueblood Killer, right? - Yeah, but I don't know why they say that. - Oh, 'cause you only killed upper-class people. You see, back in the old days, only the wealthiest people could stay out of the sun, so it was stylish to be as pale as possible. - Like you? - Yeah, yeah like me. And when you're this pale, what do you see? - Um, I see veins and stuff. - Uh huh. - Oh, they're blue. - Yeah. - Blueblood. - See, royal blood, it's the palest of all. Blueblood, see? - Yeah. - Anyway, that's what I have to ask you about. - What? - You never killed anybody of royal blood, did you? - I don't know. Why? - Why? Royal blood is the blood of kings and queens passed down from generation to generation from the very first kings who were appointed by God. Royal blood is touched by God. - God? - Sometimes I think it's the only thing left on this Earth that's touched by God. We can't waste it. - No. - Did you? - I, I, I hurt liars and, and those government people, and those politicians and a lawyer and one doctor. - There are so few of us left, you probably didn't. But, I'll need the names later so I can check, okay? - Okay. - Anyway, that's why my mom named me after the Queen when she adopted me. She was sure I had royal blood. - Mmm. Can I ask you something? - Yeah. - When do you go to the bathroom? - Any time I want. (urine tinkling) - Oh no. - Yeah. - No. - Yeah! (both laughing) - Alright, that's it. We're outta here! - Aw, Mason! - Come on, you can laugh tomorrow, when she's outta here. (serene music) (lively music) (Beth squeals) (Beth laughs) - You can tell me. - You know, my mom kept getting sicker. She kept getting sicker and sicker and the doctor kept saying that he needed something from the city and the city said it needed something from the state and the state said they needed something, lost her leg and then she died, and he said that we had a really big lawsuit. The lawyer told me that, and he showed me a list of people, and so I killed everybody on the list and then I killed him. Mom liked her hair a lot, and she was embarrassed when it fell out, so I just wanted them to know what it felt like. - Were they still-- - Alive? - Yeah. - Yeah. They were alive when I cut their legs off, too. - That's gross. - Yeah. (ominous music) (people chattering) - Hi. - Something wrong, Matron? (Estelle gasps) - Oh! They're trouble, the both of them. Inspection is day after tomorrow, and any bloody mess around here now puts our grant status in the toilet. Maybe even certain political futures. Can we afford that, Denton? - Certainly no, absolutely not, but I am sure that you will find the proper solution to it, just as you always do. - Are you saying that I can handle this situation, the way I see fit? - Within limits, Estelle. This is still the United States of America. - It is not. This is a nut house. - Language. - My great, great, great, great grandmother Sforza, by her husband. - Oh, you had to be Italian. Up until about 150 years ago, there were like 10 royal families in Italy, 'cause it was 10 countries made up Italy. Messy. - Mmhmm. (Beth chuckles) It wasn't my fault. - Yeah. (Beth sighs) (serene music) We had to make a mistake. Maybe it's gotta be okay to kill people. I mean, car makers do it, doctors do it, governments do it all the time. See I figure, there's a right kinda person to kill and a wrong kind. (ominous music) (gate beeping) When I snapped my step dad's neck, my mom dragged him outta my bed, outta my room, and into the middle of the street. (whistling) When those guys who tried to jump me when I was hitching, I'm a little girl, all by myself. Nobody complained much when I twisted their heads off. - What about running them over, like with a truck? - Are you gonna clean it up? - And my boyfriend, I caught him dirty in a single's bar. I tore his face clean off. All anybody did was stand there and gape. - A fall, from one of the guard towers? - Are you gonna clean it up? (shovel scraping) - But then, I went after her. That was a mistake. I mean, what the hell did she know? One minute, some cute guy is trying to get into her pants, the next minute his looks are on the floor and I've crushed her windpipe like a soda straw. It was wrong. You get it? - We sneak into his cell before dawn, whack him on the head, and bury him like always. - Good thinking. - Yeah. - Now keep digging. (ominous music) - Do you think I killed the right kind or the wrong kind, because I just wanted to do something right? - You did. I know you did. (serene music) Here's an idea. From now on, no more killing folks, 'til we decide it's right first. - How about if I don't do anything until you tell me it's right or wrong? - Okay. - [Joe] Okay. (Beth chuckles) (ominous music) - [Bull] Shit. - Move it, go! (door beeps) - What about Beth? - It's you they're gonna kill Joe, not her. She'll be fine. - We gotta get Beth outta here! - We can't Joe, we can't! Now she will be as fine as she could be if you stayed and got killed, right? Move! - Well then wake the fuck up, get on the computer, and get me a 20 on this guy, now! - What is it? - He's gone. Spinelli's not in his cell. - How did this happen, Mr. Carr? - Oh, I don't know, Matron. (door beeps) - Hold it, and go, go! - I need to talk to Beth first. - You can't talk to her, move! Wait, you're going this way. - I know now about this Mason. What am I gonna do out there? - You're gonna live, you're gonna live, Joe! You go out there and you live! Now, I'm not gonna be a part of this, this insanity any more. You go out there and you live, and you're gonna be a good boy, Joe, right? You're gonna be a good boy from now on, right? - Right. - Well, we're all up bright and early, ready for inspection? - [Estelle, Bull, and Carr] No! (door beeping) (door buzzing) (ominous music) (electricity buzzing) - We got a perimeter warning. It's him, Westgate. - Who? What's going on? - Spanelli is escaping. - Well, sound the alarm, you idiots. (gate beeping) (gate buzzing) - We got a Condition Red. Repeat Condition Red, dogs and handlers. (phone ringing) - What? - It's the front gate, sir. I sent your car through with the inspector. - Shit. Shit, shit. Shit. Shit, shit. (alarm blaring) What did you just do? - Sounded the alarm. - Are you nuts? The inspector is here now! No alarms, no nothing. - What? - No nothing! Nothing, nothing. - Rescind the last order, Condition Yellow, repeat, Condition Yellow. (clears throat) Green, go to Condition Green. - Thank you. There's nothing out there for miles, not even water. We'll have a nice clean, calm inspection, wait a few days, then send the dogs out to find the body, and you can bury what's left of it. (lively music) (serene music) (driver groaning) (lively music) - Oh. (gasps) (sighs) Is he the right kind or the wrong kind? He's the wrong kind, he's the wrong kind. (suspenseful music) (somber music) Yeah. - Time for another chat, Miss Windsor. Are you up for it? I must tell you, you don't look well, Miss Windsor. You don't look well at all. - I have been drugged, beaten, and electrocuted. What's your excuse? - No. Do you need me to demonstrate proper discipline procedure? (Beth groans) (Estelle and Bull laughing) - What's going on here? - [Estelle] Just standard interrogation procedure, doctor. - Really? I don't think so. I don't think so at all. (Estelle scoffs) This is torture Estelle, torture bordering on murder. You are taking this one too personally. - I take them all personally, Doctor. It's what makes me good at my job. Speaking of which, Bull. Mr. Carr. Thank you. Let's review, Miss Windsor. How did he get out? Were you involved? Was someone else involved? Where does he think he's going? How-- (Beth snoring) (Estelle screams) Mr. Carr, what's the pressure? - 200 PSI. - You wanna kill her? - No, just to soft her up real good. You said maybe you were gonna hand her over to us after you were done with her. - Hand her over? To them? Now, Estelle, as a woman-- - As a woman, I know what works. You think it's your frowny faces, doctor? Your little yellow lines? It's fear, Denton, that's what keeps everyone in line. - I really must put my foot down here. - And you have a lot to fear from me, Denton, so put that foot back in your mouth, close it, and let me do my job. - You're on your own. - Gee Doc, I think you wet your pants there. (chuckles) (Beth groaning) (somber music) - I fixed everything up Mom, just the way it used to be. (man laughing) (singing in foreign language) (record skipping) (record scratching) (somber music) - Oh, I've been watching you. You look like a man looking for a date. - A date? You mean, like with a girl? - Like with me, honey. Wanna go out? - You wanna go on a date with me? - Ooh, course I do, baby. I been looking for someone like you all my life. Hey honey, you wanna go out? (laughs) - Make an appointment. (scoffs) (blows raspberry) - You lied. - What? - You lied to me. - About what? - [Joe] You said you wanted to go on a date. - Huh, for 40 bucks honey, you could go in and out with me. Get it? No? Oh, business baby, it's only business. I provide a service, just like a lawyer or a doctor, see? Doreen girl, keep things warm for me, okay? Alright, girl. (ominous music) - [Beth] You know what I mean? We can't afford to be pissed off all the time. You and me, we need to have perspective on things. You and me... (suspenseful music) - Okay, okay, each leg strapped, each hand strapped, hips strapped, forehead strapped, huh, no knees to the groin, huh. No ball grabbing, huh, no head butts, right. And a double dose of medication. Does that cover everything? - You're date rape for dummies? (door creaking) - Yeah, and no blabbing. Believe me honey, you'll be begging for it after this. (suspenseful music) (Carr gurgling) (Beth sighs) - Where have you been? What took you so long? How did you get in here? - Bull's pass card. - I used it to stab that motherfucker. - Well, I figured the best way to handle all this right and wrong stuff is just to leave all the decisions up to you, that way we just won't make any mistakes, alright? - That is so sweet. Okay. Bull, Knull, Speck are all alright. Alright? - Yeah. They're the right ones. - Yeah. - But not Mason? - Not Mason. - And nobody else. - Nobody else. - Okay. - Unless you have to. - Alright, alright. (suspenseful music) - [Announcer] Inmates are reminded their sedadone levels must remain three parts per thousand or they will be manually dosed. We remind you, it is not pleasant to be manually dosed. (distorted recording) - Carr. Mr. Carr, what is that noise? - I don't know, Matron. - [Jumpy] Attention Ward 7 shoppers, there will be a special on any wandering guards in Block 16 in five minutes. Cha-ching! A blue plate special. No, this is a blue light special. No, no. A black and blue special. - This way, ladies. - Believe me Mason, this is for your own good. Can I get you a book or something? - Joe, I thought you were gonna be a good boy. - Did you know that being good and doing what's right, that they're not always the same thing? And right now, I gotta do what's right, and maybe later you can make good out of this whole thing. Now, I gotta go. (door clanging) - [Mason] A book. (Estelle groaning) - Welcome, I will now demonstrate payback is a bitch procedure. - No, no, oh no, you wouldn't-- (water hissing) (Estelle shouting) Fuck you! (screaming) Not the face, not the face! (Estelle groaning) - Bitch. (lively music) (Estelle groaning) (Beth gasps) - And they call me a split personality. (laughs) But it looks good on you though. - Yes, it does! Cha-ching (laughs) (sirens) - Shit, shit shit shit. Shit, shit. Joseph. How the hell did you get in here? Bull's. Oh, that moron, I'll deal with him. I would guess that you and I have things to negotiate, general amnesty, your case, you did what? - There's a technicality. - Like what? - You're no longer in charge. (Denton chuckles) (Bull and Joe groaning) - Just get up, freak. (Joe groaning) (Bull groaning) - Beth! (Joe groaning) (all groaning) (dramatic music) (glass shatters) - Cha-ching! (laughs wildly) (bones crunching) (distant rumbling) - Let's go. (suspenseful music) - Goodbye. (thumping) - See you guys! - Bye. (all gasping) (upbeat music) - [All] Bye! (ethereal music) - First thing we gotta do is we gotta get rid of this big car. So we gotta go into the city and then, then after that, maybe we'll head out to farm country. Find a place where we can pick some apples and oranges, maybe. - (laughs) Yeah. Settle down, get a house, raise a family. - Yeah. (ethereal melancholy music) Where do we find the man in charge? - Charge of what, Holmes? - Buying and selling. - Anything you need. - Got a limo? - Shit, I ain't got no fucking limo, man. - Would you like one? (suspenseful blues music) (ominous music) - Before I perforate you with double ought buck, if you've got something to say, now's the time to say it. - We're here to help. - That's right. That is exactly right. Good God damned Lord almighty, thank you very much. - Royal blood, touched by God. - Oh, about time you've come. I'm exhausted. (chuckles) You come into my dreams, right after Ma died, 30 years ago. You walked up in a dream and said just exactly what you said today. But, she wasn't really my Ma, I came here, same as you, wanderers. They took me in and they gave me a life. He's a tough old son of a bitch. He fought the railroads and the department of water, he fought the bankers. His daddy fought the Indians, the ranchers, and the bankers. And I've been fighting the realtors, the gangs, and the bankers. And you, I don't know, who would you like to fight? - I'll fight the, the bankers, probably. - Yeah, now they got these new dot commers. Watch your ass, it's just more bankers. What the hell was I talking about? - [Both] Dreams. - Oh yeah. I see death itself. Out there in the field, waving a scythe, wearing this God damned hood. I know, there's a picture of a nice lady that belongs to one of you, and it goes on that wall, right there. (suspenseful music) (snaps fingers) That's her. (Boley laughs) I put that nail up a dozen or so years ago. I put another one next to it at the same time. I can't remember why. (car horn bugling) Hey, get out of sight. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Mister Boley. Sir it's me, do not shoot. - I'd shoot because it's you, Burke. What the hell do you want? - You know, I love that sense of humor, I do. Look, I got another offer for you here, Mister Boley, and it is a beaut, trust me. - You're a realtor, Burke, you can't be trusted. Now, what part of "not for sale" needs translation in pig? - You know, my daddy told me that everything is for sale, people just don't know the price yet. It's your job to go out and find it. Oh, good Lord, have you got company? Not another realtor, I hope. - Joe, come on out here. This is Simon Burke. He's a realtor, he's been after my place for 10 years. He doesn't seem to learn. This is my nephew, Joe. He's gonna be taking over the place soon. - Well, nice to meet you, Joe. I hope he ain't as crazy as you? - Oh, he's not crazy. Now me, I'm the one that's certifiable. (both laughing) - Yeah, I love that sense of humor. Look, you check out that offer, Mr. Boley, it's a doozy, I'm sure you'll like it. Alright, nice meeting you. And maybe I'll see you again some time? - Aw, that'd be nice, that'd be real nice. (Boley laughing) - I moved the double bed in here a while back. I didn't need it, and I figured you would. So, this is your room. (Beth gasps) - It's our room, Joe, it's our room! Oh. - Yeah, well uh, I didn't know when the hell you were going to arrive, so I only get to clean it once a month or so. I'll see you in the morning, early. (Beth giggles) - Oh, yeah, damaged, not broken. Come on. Let's try this thing out. What? What is it? Why don't you come over here, sit down, and we'll talk about it. You've done this before, right? - Of course I have, I'm a guy. - You're a virgin, aren't you? - No, I, I, I've done this before. - Alone, by yourself. - Yeah. I was, I was saving myself for the right person. - Oh. - I was. - That was so romantic. (intense music) I, I may get a little excited. When I get excited-- - You mean like, arm wrestling excited? - Well, yeah. - Oh, oh, oh, okay. (Beth moans) (Beth screams) (Joe moans) (body thudding) Oh, ow! - [Boley] I admire your enthusiasm, Joe, but I'm not sure you or the house can survive it. - You okay? - Yeah. (Beth coos) - Good, then you can work. - Breakfast in an hour? - That'll be fine. Let's go. (blues music) It ain't all glory, son. (Boley laughs hysterically) I see you found the garlic. - Oh, too much? - Eh, not unless you have a date, and I don't. - I do. (suspenseful music) (Beth screaming) (furniture crashing) (Joe groans) (rooster crows) - Mmm, mmm, mmm. Oh yeah. Now, life on the farm wouldn't be so bad if I had that in my stable, not bad at all, not bad at all. - They got machines to do this, you know. They got machines to do everything. They'll even think for you, if you let them. Sometimes you just got to give it up to get what you really want. - Give it up? - Yeah, sacrifice. - For what? - For what's important to you. - Well, what's important to you? - I've seen a painting once, from a place called Middle Ages, long time ago, before they had machines, and you know what was in it? Us, doing what we're doing now. Thousands of years of men doing what we're doing now. Well that, that makes you connected, and it makes me feel right. - Yeah, yeah. - Joe? - Yeah? - Coming to bed? - He'll be right in, Beth. (screen door bangs) No disrespect Joe, but you're gonna wear out your backside, things keep going on like this. - Well, she can't help that. - Well, I don't doubt that, but you're a farmer now, Joe. And on a farm, every problem has a solution, now you find it. (Beth screams) (Beth screams) (suspenseful music) - How was that, was that alright? Hmm? - Definitely. (bed slams) (both groaning) - [Joe] Ow! - [Reporter] Following up on a whistler blowers allegations, authorities have discovered a makeshift graveyard on the grounds. Five bodies have been discovered so far with a dozen more yet to be recovered if the informant is correct. Authorities have posted a $10,000 reward for each missing inmate. But now, more than just recapturing them, they want to question them about alleged torture and executions which took place by the administrators here. - Esai. Esai. (phone beeping) Come on, come on, come on. Hey, get me Esai, por favor. Esai, compadre. It's me Simon Burke, you remember me? - [Esai] Yeah, you're the one who shot me in the foot. - No, no, jefe, I'm the one that paid you $1000 to hassle him. Boley is the one that shot you in the foot. - [Esai] Yeah but what can you say to me to keep me from shooting you in the foot the next time I see you? - How would you like to make $10,000 cash, all legal this time? - I'm listening. (suspenseful music) Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down. Put your fucking hands down. - Hey, everything alright? Alright, take it easy. Take it easy. Okay, alright. Now very simple, nobody has to get hurt here, alright? Okay. Here's the deal. The girl comes back with us to where she escaped from, so the Diablos here can get the community brownie points, and $10,000 reward. You, Mr. Boley, are gonna sign the property over to me. If you don't sign, then I turn you in for harboring a wanted fugitive. And you can spend whatever little time you got left on this planet behind bars. - Beth? - I think these folks are all alright. (dramatic music) (scythe rings) (Burke whimpering) - Oh my hand, ugh! (gun firing) (shotgun firing) (all groaning) - Arghh, my hand! Ahh, my hand! (shotgun firing) (Burke whimpering) - I want to hear you scream. - Ouch. (gun firing) - Son of a bitch. (head thunks) (scythe thunks) (gun firing) (Burke groans) - Happy now? You finally bought the farm. (Beth sighs) (melancholy music) You all right? - Look, he's finally come for me. - Oh no. That's just Joe. - No, it's another dream come true. Under the sink, Beth, behind the pipes, there's a box, get it. You've gotten pretty damned good with that thing. - Oh I-- - Lots of things, actually. - I had a real good teacher. - You're gonna have to clean this up. The leader's gone. You put that with the one I blasted. - Why? - 'Cause, he's the one that got me. - Beth. Beth! Beth, we gotta get an ambulance. - I don't want an ambulance. What I want you to do is listen. Are you listening? - Yeah, yeah, we're listening. - In the box, there's papers. To make you new people with a new life, and, and a new home. When my lawyer gets here, he'll take care of everything. - Okay. - And put some disinfectant on that hand, it looks bad. - Not as bad as yours. - Ah, this is nothing. I'm just, I'm just wore out. I'm so glad that you came home when you did. I can rest in peace now. Oh, I'll thank the Lord when I, when I see him. And I'll ask what the second nail was for. It real-, it really bothers me. (melancholy music) - I got you fresh eggs. Here we go. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. (Beth coos) (blues music) (Beth laughs) - Oh! (tractor rumbling) It ain't all glory, honey. (Joe laughing) (scythe scraping) (Joe breathing heavy) (melancholy music) - I know he taught me real good, but there's just one thing I don't think I'll ever understand that's those chickens. I wonder if they-- (Beth sniffles) What's wrong, Beth? - She's coming. - The Queen's coming to the United States? - Here. - Here? Here, here? (Beth gulps) - London Bridge, some kinda anniversary. - Oh. Beth, Beth. (melancholy music) Beth, we're, we're different now, we, we can't let these, these things control us. We got everything now, we got, we got each other and we got a house and we got everything just the way it's supposed to be. What? - The year she disappeared, the year I was born. - There's kids born everywhere. Millions and millions of kids all over the world, born everywhere. And she's, she's old enough to be your grandmother. - Five years ago, a 63 year old woman gave birth to twins. - Beth. I thought, I thought we were gonna stay here forever. - I have to know. - Well, how will you know? - She'll know, it's in the blood. - You can't talk to the Queen. She's got all those people around her, bodyguards and security, and there's police everywhere, Beth. - I have to try. - No. (Beth whimpers) (somber music) - Joe? I'm so sorry, you're absolutely... What are you doing? - You gotta see the Queen, and I gotta protect you. - Oh Joe! (plaster shatters) (Joe groans) - [Beth] (gasps) Oh! - [Joe] It's okay. (Joe groans) (upbeat music) - [Woman] Over this way. - [Man] Are we there? (Beth sighs) - Oh Beth. I sure like the way things are. - You know, royal blood is no gravy. When God touches you, responsibility comes with it. - What if she doesn't like me? - Joseph Spinelli Sporza XIII, how could she not love you? (people cheering) (marching band music) - [FBI Agent] On your toes everybody, she's at a hundred yards. 50 yards from the turn, everybody stay wired. (bagpipe music) - [FBI Agent] On your six, Evan. Somebody stepped out. - [Beth] Joe! What did you do? - Come on. - [Beth] Oh God. Joe, she looked right at me. - So did the police. - What? - We gotta get out of here. - Joe, it was the... - [Joe] Uh oh. - What? (siren chirping) - Joe, she has a-- - Let's move. - Where are we-- - Just go. - Joe. I wanna run after the guy, Joe. What's-- (Beth gasps) (classical music) Joe, cake! Look Joe, it's a London Bridge cake. Champagne. - They had two chairs, right over there, over there. - Hi. Wow, look at this towel. Hey. Hi. This your first time meeting the Queen? - Beth. - [Beth] No, we go way back. Nice br-- (gun firing) (people screaming) - Get down! (plates shattering) - Hey, Rocco! (gun firing) (Joe groans) (plates shattering) - [Man] Hurry! (both breathing heavy) - Oh, Joe. I'm so sorry, this is all my fault. God, I was this close. Give me the gun. - No, wait a second, wait a second. (classical music) - How bad is it? - I seen worse. Did she really recognize you? - Joe, I swear, she sat right up and held out her hand for me to take it. - Then it was all worth it, right? - I don't know, kinda depends on how this all works out. - [Woman] We have a positive ID on one of them, Zebra Two, it's the Edgemar escapee wanted for multiple homicides. You're clear to take the shot. - Tack two, tack two, listen up everybody. If you get a clean shot, take it. - You really are a princess. - Yeah, I guess I am. - Royal blood, touched by God, passed down through the ages, generation to generation, thousands and thousands of years. You really are a princess. - Yeah. (Beth sighs) (punch thuds) (Beth groans) (ominous music) - I got a hostage here! And I'll kill her! I got a hostage! I got a hostage and I'll kill her! (suspenseful music) Don't anybody move. I'll kill her, I'm dangerous! - Central, Zebra two, we have a situation change here. - I killed everybody up at that Edgemar place, the administrator and all those orderlies, I killed everybody, and I'll kill her! She's my hostage and I don't need her anymore, I'll kill her. - Take it easy fella. We're willing to talk about it. What do you want? - What? - What do you want? - I want, I want a car, and I wanna get outta here. I want, I want that car to take me to a helicopter, and then I want the helicopter to take me to an airport. And I want a plane to take me to another country, and I want money. - How much money? - What? Well, how much you got? (sirens wailing) Shh, shh. - You hit me. - Yeah. - Well, why did you do that? - Hit me. - What? - Hit me Beth, hit me. - No, I don't wanna hit you. - I said hit me. - No. - Hit me. - What's the, ow. ("Amazing Grace") (guns firing) (people chattering) - [Man] Is she okay? - [Man] Maybe a minor concussion, from this incident. - What's that mean? - [Man] She's got more wounds of every kind than I've ever seen. You see those marks, that's burns, electrical I'd say, bruises, contusions, probably displaced vertebrae. Her left has a laceration that nearly cut it in half. And this girl's been tortured, a lot, over a long period of time. - [Man] But they've been loose only two months. - [Man] Yeah, it couldn't have just been him, could it? (sirens blaring) (ethereal music) - Everything going okay? - Fine. Great, actually. It's like a hotel, everybody is so nice. - Not that often we have a real heroine staying with us. - [Beth] Oh. - [Therapist] With this, the ordeal you went through, and time served, you should be looking forward to that psychiatric review board. They set the date, four months from today. They wanted to wait, until after. - Yeah, it's great news. - If the next four months go like the past six, I'd say it is great news. It all depends on you, Beth. - Then it'll be great news. - [Therapist] Have you picked out a name yet? - Oh, Prince. - As in "The Artist formerly known as"? - No, as in what a King is formerly known as. Prince Joseph Windsor. He'll have a name he can live up to. - Hmm, royalty is an awfully high standard to live up to, Beth. - Ah, not for him. In the blood, you know. It's all in the blood.
