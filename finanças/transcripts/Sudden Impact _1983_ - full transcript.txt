- Twenty-two, 11. - Twenty-two, 11. Twenty-two, 11. Officer down, corner of Centre and Hardy. Twenty-two, 11. En route. All rise, please. The Court of California is now in session. The Honourable Judge Lundstrom, presiding. Please be seated. Mr D'Ambrosia, this case is a travesty. You have no evidence whatsoever linking the accused to the murder. The gun found in his car was obtained as the result of an illegal search. In the eyes of the court, it does not exist. The search was illegal because Inspector Callahan... And this is an old story. Did not have sufficient probable cause for detaining Mr Hawkins. The gun is inadmissible and the charges against the defendant... are dismissed. Mr D'Ambrosia... be assured that I will discuss your case-preparation techniques... with the district attorney. Bailiff, next. How many times, Callahan? Sixth sense doesn't count any more. You can't bust them because you think they're dirty. Psychic don't cut it. Hey, Callahan. Don't look so puked-out. Better luck next time, fool. Listen, punk. To me, you're nothing but dog shit, you understand? And a lot of things can happen to dog shit. It can be scraped up with a shovel off the ground. It can dry up and blow away in the wind, or it can be stepped on and squashed. So take my advice: Be careful where the dog shits you. You're a class act, Callahan. A real class act. Loretta. All right, folks. You did real good with that cop. Now, I want everything. Money, watches, rings, everything. Oh, my God. Quick. Move. You're coming with me, mama. We'll have us a little party, huh? What you doing, you pig-head sucker? Every day for the last 10 years... Loretta there has been giving me a large black coffee. Today she gives me a large black coffee, only it's got sugar in it. A lot of sugar. I just came back to complain. Now, you boys put those guns down. Say what? Well, we're not just gonna let you walk out of here. Who is "we," sucker? Smith & Wesson... and me. Go ahead... make my day. Call D'Ambrosia in the D.A.'s office, ask him if coffee is psychic. Now forward. 10-4. - Hey, Ernie. - What? Look at that, going up the steps into the hotel. Is that who I think it is, huh? Oh, shit. Why me? A nothing detail, a lousy goddamn peeper tour. Well, so, what do we do now? We call Captain Briggs, let him decide. Yeah. May I have your invitation, sir? Oh, I don't understand, Inspector Callahan. Do you know the emergency phone number for San Francisco General? Yes, I do. Well, why don't you call them right now and have them send an ambulance? Tell them there's two sorry-looking assholes... with multiple contusions and various abrasions and broken bones. - Inspector Callahan. - I wanna talk to Threlkis. At his granddaughter's Wedding? On what business? I wanna help him catch the bouquet. They have harassment laws, Inspector. Sit down. Please. Champagne? It's imported. You know, men, like wine, should grow finer, more civilised. They should mellow, become more worldly. But not Callahan. Callahan is the one constant in an ever-changing universe. Linda Doker? She was fished out of the bay a month ago... with her breasts slashed, her feet burned... her face smashed to a pulp. I read about it. A hooker, wasn't she? A very expensive one. In fact, her speciality was making old scumbags mellow and worldly. I think she had a special customer who told her a lot of things. You are a fool, Callahan. She might have been clever enough to write these things down. Maybe she made a copy of it. Maybe she didn't even tell about it when she was being tortured and beaten. I wonder what that old scumbag's bosses are gonna say when they find out about it. Or maybe his family. - Maybe his ass is in a wringer. - You... You fuck... Fucking bas... - What is it? - You... You fucking... - We need a doctor. - What happened? Would someone help us? Something's wrong here. - Call an ambulance. - Grandpa. - Oh, what is it? - What happened? - Sorry, Inspector, but Captain... - What happened? Somebody grabbed their chest. They must've seen the bill. Oh, my God. Stand back, please. Stand back. Hey, Harry, wait till you see what we got here. Some stiff's got himself a .38-calibre vasectomy. Ha-ha. Harry, you don't look so hot. Bad night? All nookied out? Who do you think? Gang hit, screwed-up drug score, unlucky John? Or an unhappy love affair? Hey, don't tell me this shit's getting to you. Not Harry Callahan. Say it ain't so. No, this stuff isn't getting to me. The shootings, the knifings, the beatings. Old ladies being bashed in the head for their Social Security checks. Teachers being thrown out of a window because they don't give A's. - That doesn't bother me a bit. - Come on, Harry, take it easy. Or this job either, having to wade through the scum of this city. Being swept away by bigger and bigger waves of corruption, apathy and red tape. No, that doesn't bother me. But you know what does bother me? You know what makes me sick to my stomach? What? Watching you stuff your face with those hot dogs. Nobody, I mean nobody, puts ketchup on a hot dog. What the hell are you talking about? Talking about having our fingers in the holes... and the whole dike's crumbling around us. Inspector Callahan? Yeah, Lieutenant Donnelly says to get your... self... to the commissioner's office. On the double. Swell. Leah, can I speak with you? Jennifer, what marvellous timing. Look, I'm giving your work the favourite positions. That's very nice of you, but I'm afraid you'll be wasting good selling spots. Nonsense, child. They're the jewels of the exhibit. Don't be discouraged if they don't sell immediately. They're so intense, people take time to get used to them. To tell the truth, I'm just getting used to them myself. How can such a howl of anguish come from such a sweet girl as you? I'm leaving town. - No. When? - Today. But you'll miss the exhibit, you'll miss the opening. Well, I'm much better at the painting than I am the receptions. Can I give you an address to send the paintings? Of course. But think positive. It's money we'll be sending from the sales. - Where will you go? - North, to visit someone. - Hey. - What's happening? Whoo. Look at the blond baby. Mama, check it out. - How you doing? - Hey. How you doing, huh? She wants to play. - Need a lift? - Sure, baby. Then shove a jack up your ass. Puta. - Yo, man. - Move. Shut up. In more than 30 years of police work, this is the single most outrageous... transgression of authority I ever heard about. What did you think you were doing? My job. Is it your job to harass and incite an old man into a heart attack? My job is to investigate homicide. That old man happens to be one of the biggest crime lords on the West Coast. How the hell did I know he was gonna vapour-lock? But you hoped he would. The Doker case is mine. It was at a standstill. I was trying to break it loose. Sure, with threats and intimidation. Any way possible. Are you aware... that you have destroyed months of surveillance and intelligence work? We're talking here thousands of dollars, hundreds of man-hours. Special Investigations has been busting its ass preparing a case against Threlkis. He would've just snaked his way out of it. Maybe we saved the taxpayers a little money. I ought to bust your ass down to Traffic. Or better yet, kick it off the force. You're a dinosaur, Callahan. Your ideas don't fit today. Just what ideas are these? That murder's a crime, that it shouldn't be punished? Hey. Don't you lecture me, you son of a bitch. You know who you're talking to? You know my record? Yeah. You're a legend in your own mind. - Goddamn you, Callahan. - Gentlemen, that's enough. Inspector, your methods are unconventional, to say the least. Oh, you get results. But often your successes are more costly to the city and this department... in terms of publicity and physical destruction than most other mens' failures. - Commissioner... - Please. The press'll have a field day with this escapade. There may be further civil and legal repercussions. As a matter of fact, there may be attempts at retaliation. I think it would be wise if the Inspector took some time off. Are you suspending me, sir? No, I'm suggesting you take a vacation until this cools off. Well, I'm not up for a vacation. Callahan, I'm not gonna fence with you. Take a few days off. Harry, a couple of days. Think things over, Callahan. Get with it. It's a whole new ballgame these days. Funny, I never thought of it as a game. I examined your sister Elizabeth, and I tested her again yesterday. There haven't been any changes. The computerised tomogram doesn't show any evidence... of chronic subdural haematoma. Physically, she's in good condition. But she remains in this vegetative state that we've been unable to penetrate. We can't even get a primitive startle response out of her. Now, we're gonna keep trying. We're always hopeful. You should be too. Dr Blooming, call your office, please. Dr Blooming, Dr Mockleter. Dr Richard Mockleter, please call Line 5. Dr Mockleter, Line 5. Hi, baby. It's me. Jen. I missed you. Dr Blooming, call your office, please. Dr Blooming. Beth? I saw one of them. He just appeared on the street in front of me. At first I thought I was having some horrible vision. But no. He was there. Older, uglier. I followed him. For days I watched him. Then I bought a gun. I followed him to a bar. Let him pick me up. Let him drive me to a deserted spot. Let him think... It was like I was outside myself. Above me, looking down. Then he touched me. And I killed him. Beth? I love you. Hell of a way to spend the night off, Harry. You joining the act too? No, for christ sakes. Back off a little. I'm worried about your ass. You're gonna get it shot off or kicked out of here. - So, what else is new? - Harry. These bastards are not a bunch of junkies. To their minds, you killed Threlkis, same as if you pulled the trigger. They won't stop. They'll keep coming after you. Good, that way we'll know where they are. You're incredible, Callahan. You're also on vacation as of right now. I'm not up for a vacation. You are, damn it, I just put you up. Now, go grab yourself some R and R and stay out of trouble. You hear me, Callahan? Peace and quiet. Good morning, Horace. Sweet Sister Sadie, where the hell did you get that? I've had it a while. I just thought I'd get used to it. I heard about the car. Fabulous, coming after you in tanks. Yeah, they're making those these days, for sheiks and business executives, hoods. Impregnable to about anything but artillery. Well, you got that covered. Not bad. Not bad, my ass. You gotta strain the remains for the fingerprints. Well, this is the .44 Magnum Auto-Mag. It holds a 300-grain cartridge... and if properly used, it can remove the fingerprints. Hey, I heard you got a vacation, man. And I got just the place for you to go. - You've got that wrong. - You ain't got no choice. I think maybe I do. Hey. What, you thinking about quitting? I might just do that. Look at the field, man. Look at what you did up there. Well, it's not quite good enough. Hey. You can't quit, that's where we're at. Okay, jamf? What's the brass gonna do, huh? What'll they do about their ulcers? Who are they gonna complain to? Okay, the PR guy's kissing ass, kissing ass that you kicked. You ain't nothing but a cop. Now, that's all you've been and that's all you ever gonna be, jamf. Thank you, doctor. Now, listen, when you get cut, you'll bleed P.D. blue, jamf. What the hell's a "jamf"? That means you're a jive-ass mother... Forget I asked. Mm. Almost there. I hope the house is suitable. It's a wee bit deserted out there in West Cliff. But I thought you might appreciate the solitude as you seek inspiration. The house is lovely. Well, I've left the fridge and the cupboard stocked. And there's firewood for a fire. And let's see, here are the keys... for the carousel house. Everything you need should be here. But if you have any additional wants, we have an account in Dunstan's. Thank you. Oh, Miss Spencer, I can't tell you how really happy we are... that you're taking over this work for the Historical Society. Because your work is so impressive and so impeccably authentic. I do my research. Well, it must give you a great feeling of satisfaction... to make old, ugly things right again. Yes, sometimes it does. It don't look like you the type. - I like this one. - Oh, that's gorgeous. Come on, you guys, don't look so down. This is a party. Come on. You like what I brought you, baby? Come here, baby. I like you, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Come on, baby. Come on, give me something. Come on, you guys, give me some. No. That's right, come with me. Not yet. Come on, baby. Tell him that you like it. Don't forget, I get my shot at the other one. Hey, Alby. What are you, queer? - There he is. There he is. - Okay. We'll show you what dog shit is. Come on. Let's go kick some ass. Whoo. There he is. We've got him. We got him. We got him. So that's your idea of rest and recreation? What the hell's wrong with you? Briggs is gone berserk and the commissioner's climbing up my ass. I'm sorry to hear about that. Damn it, can't you do anything the easy way? - Look, am I on the job or not? - Yes, you are. Good. Then I'll get to it. - It's not what you think. - Oh? Remember that cock-shot stiff out by the Cliff House? Yeah. He's been in the city a few years... mostly clean, but definitely out in the shade. He looks strictly small-time, but who knows? Maybe he just never got caught. And? He came from San Paulo, born and raised. I want you to get down there and pick up whatever background you can on him. - What is this crap? - It's a murder case, Harry. And you're shipping me out? Goddamn it, I'm doing you a favour. You're a walking freaking combat zone. People have a nasty habit of getting dead around you. I don't want any civilians taking the fall. You wanna work? Fine, work. Now, you got your assignment. Get the hell out of here and get on with it. Take all the time you need. You don't have to hurry back. Maybe the salt air'll agree with you. Inspector, any comment? Swell. Freeze, mother... What? That way. Around the corner. Hey, what...? Hey, what's the matter with you? You trying to kill someone? My bike. - Excuse me. - Is it time to go on the bus now? Where's he going? Police Officer in pursuit of a robbery suspect. Hang on. - Shag his ass. - Yeah, get that sucker. You gotta nail that son of a bitch. Good God, is he all right? I guess I'd better read you your rights. The best damn day trip I had since they dropped me in that damn home. Holy mackerel. So you're the famous Harry Callahan. Harry, I'm gonna make this short and sweet. I'm only gonna say it once. We don't need any big-city hotshot... to come here and show us dumb yokels how to do our business. We know how to do our business, so you keep your nose out of it. You read me, Harry? Aye, aye, sir. Easy, boy. Horace, you son of a bitch. Swell. Damn, Meathead. What did you call me? Oh, I was talking to the dog. - Is that your dog? - Yeah. Why? Do you want him? Listen, buster, if you can't control him, get a leash. There are laws. Quiet. Well, you seem to be all right. I'm fine, but you'd better get it together. Quiet. - This way, Inspector. - He's the one from San Francisco. This is it, Inspector. The coffee room's down the hall. The john's on the other side of it. And if that's all, I think I'll get back to work. Nice work yesterday, Inspector. It was me. You saved my life. Thanks. Right. If there's anything... - There you go. - Great. - Can I help you? - Draft. Come on. It's my game, my game. Ha. You son of a bitch. Come on, dickhead, fork over the bucks before I kick your nuts up into your nose. I ain't got any bucks, Ray. I pissed it away. Come on. What about you? Pull something out of your pants besides that wet string. I ain't got much, man. We've been here all day. Eddie won't run us no more tab. Give me what you got, twat-lips, before I give your face its first period. Here, man. That's it. Hey, yo, Kruger. Wanna go a couple of chugalugs for some scratch? What about us? Suck my ass with a straw. How about it, Kruger? What do you say? I'm out of here. Shit, Kruger. You're good for shit any more. You know that? I don't know what's happened to you. Hi, Cutie. Wanna buy me a drink? Not today. Come on, sailor. I know there's some question you wanna ask me. Go ahead. You might get lucky. Only with humans. You s... Hey. You... Hey. Oh, shit. - Shit. - Looking for trouble, pal? I'm looking for friends of George Wilburn's. - Are you a cop? - What did he do? He lost his balls. He got killed. - Turn it off. - What? You don't remember, do you? Remember what? My sister and I will never forget. One night... long ago? Under the boardwalk? Remember? Well, it looks like I owe you one, Meathead. - Inspector, what are you...? - Where's Jannings? He's out at Buckman Cove. Some fisherman discovered a body there. Jannings personally checks on every corpse that turns up? No, sir. But this was pretty clearly a murder. Off the record, sir, the victim was shot twice. Once in the head, once in the genitals. We should go in the outer office. Chief gets... You know anybody in this picture here? Not really. I think they're just friends of the Chief's son, I guess. What about this girl right here? The dyke? Yeah. Everybody knows Ray Parkins. She's nothing. She's just a local. Why? She looked familiar. I thought maybe I'd brushed across her somewhere. Yeah, well, it's pretty hard not to brush across her in San Paulo. All right. Back up. You folks just stay right where you are. No, stay away. Please stand back. All right, Sergeant. Why didn't you call me? Just who are you that I should call you? What went on at your hotel this morning? What do you make of this? Well, you tell me, Mr Big-City Inspector. Everywhere you go, something gets smashed or somebody gets killed... and I don't like it. And I don't like you. So you just finish your research and get out of my town. It's more than research now. Either you're too stupid or too pigheaded to realise that. - Get out of here. - The M.O.'s the same. Ballistics will ID the bullet as coming from the same gun. I can... You're not gonna do one goddamn thing but get your ass out of here. I mean now. I mean, right this goddamn minute. Or I swear to Jesus I'll lock you up. I thought I told you I don't want you in my store. I gotta talk to you, you stuck-up asshole. We've got nothing to say to each other. Oh, yeah? You hear the radio? Leave my store. Kruger's dead. They found him this morning. He had his balls splattered all over the front of his pants. - I don't care, Ray. - Yeah? Same thing happened to Wilburn up in San Francisco. - Wilburn? - Yeah. Remember him? He's dead. Well, that's twice I don't care. Well, you better care, prick. - I think she's come back. - Who? Oh, don't try and pretend with me, you hypocritical shit. You dipped your wick just like the rest of them. Will you shut your mouth? You evil witch. What's the matter, afraid somebody's gonna hear? Afraid you'll lose some of your customers if they find out? There's nothing to find out. You make me wanna puke. I'm gonna call Mick. Look, you do what you want, but keep that psycho bastard away from me. I'll tell him you said that. Watch them real good. And be prepared... boy scout. Now, see. Just like I told you. You hurt me this time, and it's gonna be your last, you bastard. Hurt you, babe? What do you take me for? - Let me up. - Sure, babe, sure. In a minute. Say it first. Say it. - Mickey. - Yeah. - Baby... - Mm. - You're so beautiful. - Yeah. I want you, Mickey. - How bad do you want me, baby? - I want you bad. - Yeah? - You're so strong. Huh. Yeah. You're everything a man should be. - Oh, yeah, baby, that's right. - You're... Keep talking, baby. Come on. - Don't stop now, bitch. - I can't. The phone. Who the fuck is this? Well... how do? Getting near my time to call you. I like it like this. Yeah. Maybe we'll just keep it this way since you know how to find me. That so? Well, we'll just have to do something about that, won't we? Yeah? Horace, I'd like you to do me a favour. Could you get me the ballistics on the Wilburn killing? The what? Oh, yeah, I got him. Almost as ugly as you are. He does have his good points, though. Could you wire out that report in the morning? Listen, you just keep your ass covered until I can get this arranged, okay? Thanks. Kruger. Okay- But, Jesus, if Chief Jannings finds out... He won't. Just get me the information any way you can. The names, where they are, where they work. It's not gonna be easy, Inspector. I don't dare risk taking that photo off his wall. One other thing. Could you get me Kruger's sheet? Anything else? Just the address. Mrs Kruger? Can I have a word with you? You from the insurance company, pal? No. Then if you don't wanna buy some of these fish, get your ass out of here. Mrs Kruger, my name's Callahan. You got shit in your ears, buddy? I'd like to ask you a few questions about your late husband. That lousy son of a bitch? He leaves me nothing. I'm up to my ass in bills. He let the insurance run out. Then he gets killed looking at dirty pictures... when he ain't even touched me in months, the bastard. Say, can't you see our sister's in mourning? Why don't you get the hell out of here? Why don't you boys go suck some fish heads, huh? Don't even think about it. Well, I'll come back... when you're less bereaved. Well, you've come a long way. Well, somebody told us to get it together. I have a feeling you've heard that before. Sorry if I was a little gruff... but you and your friend did take me by surprise. Well, buy me a beer, and we'll call it even. All right. Stay, Meathead. Waiter, a beer for Mr? Callahan. And another for me, please. I'll have that right here for you. I'm Jennifer Spencer. So how's police business? What makes you think I'm a cop? I saw the commotion here the other day. You're either a cop or public enemy number one. Some people might say both. Really? Who? Oh, bozos with big brass nameplates on their desks... and asses the shape of the seat of their chairs. Why? It's a question of methods. Everybody wants results... but nobody wants to do what they have to do to get them done. And you do? I do what I have to do. I'm glad, Callahan. But, you know, you're an endangered species. This is the age of lapsed responsibilities and defeated justice. Today, "an eye for an eye" means "only if you're caught." Even then it's an indefinite postponement and "let's settle out of court." Does that sound profound or just boring? Sorry, I'm sure you get that sort of thing all the time. No, I don't hear it enough. Well, I promise to adjourn Philosophy 101. - What do you do for a living? - I paint. Paint? Houses, cars, what? Horses. - Horses? - Hobbyhorses. I'm restoring the carousel here. Somehow, you don't seem like the typical San Paulo policeman. I'm not. - Typical? - San Paulo. San Francisco P.D., Homicide. Don't tell me this is your idea of a vacation. No, I'm down here on a case. Just gathering information in general. Anything interesting? It's coming around. Got any theories? Somebody's doing some killing, and I have a hunch it's gonna go on. - A psycho? - Probably. Of course, it could be somebody just collecting on a debt. Revenge? The oldest motivation known to mankind. And you don't approve? Until it breaks the law. You gonna want another one of these? No, I work early. 41lgetthat - No, no. A deal's a deal. - Good night. - Good night. - Hey, mister, that your dog? - Why, you want him? Swell. My turn, clown. The witch was right. It is you. Put down the gun. Now, look, I mean, you gotta understand something. That was a long time ago. It was 10 years ago. I was just a... A kid. I didn't mean anything by it. I know it was wrong... but I was drunk. I didn't even know what I was doing. Well, I'm a businessman now. I'm making money. I can give you some of it. You need money, right? Please. It wasn't my fault. The others made me do it. Don't make me beg. It wasn't that bad, was it? Not bad enough to kill me for. People sell it every day. They give it away for... Christ, don't. Please. Don't shoot me. Come in. Close the door. Sit down. It's for you. Yeah? Harry, what the hell's going on down there? Jannings is bending the commissioner's ear. He's a good guy. Go easy with him, will you? Harry, you don't have a hell of a lot of friends upstairs. Don't screw yourself, okay? Understand? No, I don't understand... at all. Here's the ballistic reports for the Kruger and Wilburn killing. I think you'll find they match up perfectly. So that's the story, kid. So our little college honey is collecting dues, huh? Yeah, you got it. Heads up. - So, what are we gonna do? - We snuff her. This town's got thousands of people. Maybe she's not even staying here. How do we find her? We don't. - What do you mean? - We wait. She's coming after you too sometime, right? - I suppose. - Well, we'll be here. Make her feel real welcome. Yeah, what about Tyrone and Alby? I don't give a fuck about Tyrone. Alby's covered. How? The guy's a zombie. He doesn't even know if he's pissing himself. He's covered. Okay. - You never give up, do you? - It's my job, remember? What do you want from me, Callahan? I wanna know why you're dragging your ass in this investigation. Every available man is on the street. We're logging more overtime than the township can afford to pay. Now, we're gonna get that maniac. Do you believe these killings are random? I reject no theory at this time. But in case you haven't noticed, there's been no truce declared on the muggings... the shoplifting, the burglaries, the drunken driving. All these less-headline-grabbing crimes that we face here every day. Now, we're doing the best we can. Maybe that's not good enough. Callahan, this is not, repeat, not, your jurisdiction, so you stay out of it. I'm warning you. Aren't you curious as to why I was here? So... you coming to the party I told you about? Oh, I can't. My sister's visiting. Yeah? She a college girl too? No, she's a junior in high school. Bring her. The more, the merrier. I don't think so. What's the matter? Us locals not good enough for you? It's not that. You don't understand. Oh, all right, we'll come, but we have to leave early. Leave whenever you'd like. Who knows? You may have a nice time. This is Callahan. Can I talk to Bennett? I'll patch you through. Bennett here. Bennett, would you run a plate for me? 1-Adam-Queen-Ida-1-7-5. - All right, Inspector. - Thanks. What the fuck are you doing? - You fucking pig. - Just give me a little bit. - Get your hands off me. - Jesus Christ. All I wanted was... - I'll bust every bone in your... - Come on, man. Come on. Wait. What the hell is this? Police officer. I'd like to ask you a few questions. My ass. You? Goddamn it. Son of a bitch. You bastard. Knock it off. Stop it. Now, boy, you're gonna come downtown and we're gonna answer some questions. You don't have to answer nothing, Mick. You son of a bitch, I'll get a lawyer. He'll be out tomorrow, you fucking bastard. God. So... the bitch is here. So tell me. How's your slut sister? Book him. A little late for Wave-watching, isn't it? I couldn't sleep. - Want a beer? - Thanks. It's not safe to be out alone after dark. Life's full of risks, isn't it? I better go home. Thanks for the beer. - Did you bicycle down here? - No, I walked. It relaxes me. Well, I'll give you a ride home. Oh, that's all right. It's okay, it relaxes me. This is it. Well, thanks for the lift. Would you like something stronger to drink than beer? Come on in. I don't mind if I do. I'll get some brandy. Unusual. Yeah. I have a rule. Never drink with a critic. You wanna be alone tonight, Callahan? Neither do I. Okay, Harry, wake up, sucker. The heat's off and we're gonna celebrate. Well, well, well. Kiss your ass goodbye, Sambo. Bennett. Bennett, I think you better send somebody out to Ray Parkins' place. She's getting ripe. Have that punk brought down to the interrogation room. I've gotta ask him some questions. Oh, sorry, Inspector, he's been released. Who sprung him? Kruger's brother-in-law picked him up less than an hour ago. Swell. Inspector, I'll get that licence plate number you wanted. No. No, no, forget about that. That turned out to be nothing. Thanks. I don't know where they are. I don't wanna answer your questions. Just leave me alone. Hotshot cop. Your ass is mine. Mick, the gun. Cocksucker. Drop the gun. He couldn't live with it. The other vermin didn't care. But the guilt ate at his gut... like an acid. He actually wanted you to come back. He used to sit at night, waiting, praying that you'd come back. One night he couldn't wait any longer. He just got in his car, he drove off, smashed himself into a retaining wall. And now you're here and he doesn't even know it. It's my fault. I should have let him be punished then... along with the other filth. But he's my only child. His mother died giving birth to him. We're all each other have. I was afraid for him. I was afraid for me. You see, I was a public figure. So... I did things. I fixed it. And now I want you to just go. Let it end. There's one left. And I've got him... in my jail. And you just leave him to me. He preyed on Alby, preyed on me ever since. That too is gonna end. Oh, is that so, Lester boy? Ah ah. Put down the piece, Lester. Or I'll splatter what's left of the retard's brains... all over the floor. Hi, babe. Is this what you had in mind for me? You almost fucked up here, Lester. But don't worry, I'm gonna take care of everything. And you won't have to do a damn thing but sit on your fat ass. But first, me and the little babe gonna relive us some old times. Damn, Mick. You didn't say nothing about doing the Chief. Don't sweat it. It's a freebie. We just signed our little honey's name to it. Horace? Shit, man. Hey, you remember this place, baby? Huh? Aw, sure. You remember. I wonder if it's any better after all these years. If there's anything left, you boys can have a piece. Okay, you prickless scum. You wanna try it again? You think you can get it up this time? Think you can make it work this time? If you want me, you filthy maggot... you take me. Because this time you'll have to rape my dead body. No. The bitch is mine. All right. You lousy cunt. - You all right, Mick? - Get her. Get the bitch. Come on, come on. Where is she? Oh, there she is. That way, Eddie. You ain't getting out of here, baby. Over here. Go around the other way. Close in on her. She got away. Where is she? The door. No, you don't, sweetie. Holy shit. Come on, cop. Come up and enjoy the party. We got a class reunion happening up here. Let the girl go, punk. Let my baby go? I can't do that. This is my baby. This is my prize. Come on, cop, you know I can't do that. I can't just let her go. Then it would be just you and me. Come on, make my day. That's not a bad idea, is it? What happens now? - Well, I guess now I've got to... - Read me my rights? Well, what exactly are my rights? And where was all this concern for my rights when I was being beaten and mauled? And what about my sister's rights when she was being brutalised? There is a thing called justice. And was it justice that they should all just walk away? You'll never understand, Callahan. Inspector, we found a .38 snub in his belt. Run it through ballistics. I think you'll find his gun there was used in all the killings. Then it's over? Yeah, it's over.
