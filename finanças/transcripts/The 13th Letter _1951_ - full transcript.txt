POISON CARDS �Hola, George! �De viaje, Dr. Laurent? Yes, I come from a congress in Montreal. Oh thanks. Is it all? - Yes, that's all for today. I have heard fifteen speeches, ...but I've only learned one thing. There is nothing a man loves more than the sound of his own voice. That's true. Of course. These congresses serve other purposes. They give the doctors, with the women at home, the possibility of an affair. Well, not you, doctor. You have the most wonderful woman in town. �Cora? �Cora? - Good afternoon, sister. - Good afternoon. Thank you. - Nurse. - Yes? The Gauthier boy just called you. �Nuestro h�roe! Oh, there's a letter for Dr. Pearson. Oh, it's you, Marie. Are you here again? Is that a way to greet a sister? Just because we're sisters doesn't necessarily mean we're friends. Is Paul back from Montreal? You have to come back today. Then he can wait for you at home. After six years of marriage, ...I don't need anyone to remind me of my duties as a wife. Well, Cora, we're sisters. I am going to speak to you frankly. You married a good man. Paul is respected here as a person and as a doctor. I think you have to be careful not to do anything that could harm him. Are you trying to tell me something? What is it? You can't chase youngsters in a town like this without raising gossip. Especially when that man is as well known as Dr. Pearson. I won't reply to that. I hope you can answer your confessor. Don't be so hypocritical. You've never forgiven me for Paul. It wasn't my fault that he preferred to marry me. You may still like it, for all I know. Don't judge me for...! - Good afternoon, Miss Cora. - Good afternoon doctor. - What can I do for you? - You had a call, doctor. I would like to tell you about our club. We meet at my house every two weeks, on Tuesday nights. We are studying the life of birds on the Gaspee Peninsula. The little birds. And she was asking me if you would like to join us. It's very kind of you, Mrs. Laurent, but I'm not very interested in birds. Ni peque. Os ni grandes. This is very urgent, doctor. I called twice. Oh, it's mainly a way to make friends. I thought maybe you... are new here, ...and you might feel lonely, ...sometimes. I appreciate your invitation, but my work keeps me very busy. I really don't have time for myself. Do you understand? Of course. I forgot that you are seeing people all day, ...as a doctor, I mean. I hope you didn't mind my offer. - Absolutely. - Good morning, doctor. - Good morning. You must come soon, Marie, and see Paul. S�, Cora. Stubborn patients! Always in a hurry. And Denise, her landlord's daughter, called too. It has a cold. I'll see her later, when I get home. Doctor. There is a letter for you. Are you having fun, Michelle? What's wrong with your sister? You are the doctor, doctor. Between. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Don't open the window. I have a cold. I can't stand this perfume. What is the problem? My whole body aches and I feel tired. Come on, be more specific. Where does it hurt? It's my back. The left side. Si�ntese. Aqu�. Take off your jacket. Just the jacket. �Aqu�? S�. �Y aqu�? S�, ah� tambi�n. Say 33. - 33. - Don't yell. 33. 33. 33. It's fine. Lie down, please. Are you a pa�uelo? Isn't my nightgown enough? Why is he holding his breath? Sorry. Take a deep breath, please. Breathe normally. What do you want? Mrs. Laurent is here to see Dr. Pearson. In a moment. S�, doctor. Wait outside. S�. - Is that all? - Yes. - And what happens to me? - You know better than me. - I don't know what you mean. - I think so. Please don't be mysterious. Okay, I'll tell him. You are not sick and you do not need a doctor. Oh come on, Denise. Don't pretend. If you want men to visit you, why don't you call one of your friends? Some doctors are men too. That is true, but they are fools if they mix work and pleasure. He will send his father the bill at the end of the month. He has no heart. I'm sure you have a heart for both of them. Dr. Pearson. Please forgive me, but I need to talk to you. Of course. I know they are stupid before in the hospital, ...but I couldn't really tell him what he wanted. For his sister? S�, by Marie. Si�ntese, Sra. Lawrence. None of this has ever happened to me before. I don't know what to do. Do about what? About the letter I received. It's so disgusting. I didn't know whether to show it to him. I think it concerns you. L�ala. Do you also have one? I think they have the same letter. The same writing. "Sra. Laurent: I'm watching you and Dr. Pearson. Stop before it's too late." Unsigned. Some people still use these old pens. "Dr. Pearson: Before I tell Dr. Laurent about you and Cora, ...I give you a chance to leave the city." Why us? Why have they chosen us? I don't know. Dr. Pearson. You haven't told anyone about me, have you? I mean, in a personal sense, that could have been misunderstood. I do not understand you. What does it mean? It's hard to explain. I hope I don't sound modest, ...but you know that people gossip in small towns, ...just to have something to talk about. So when I got the letter, ...I thought you might have said something about me, ...innocently, of course, and... ...someone might have heard it. You are a very beautiful woman, Mrs. Laurent. That is obvious to anyone who sees her. But I'm sure I haven't had occasion to mention it. Sorry. I'm taking you home. Very kind of you. But I don't think it's for the best, given the circumstances. Maybe you're right. You shouldn't worry too much, Mrs. Laurent. It's probably a joke, and the best we can do is forget it. Thank you Doctor. I think he is right. I have abused your time too much, forgive me. Is well. What did he say before, that I was pretty? It's one of the nicest things I've ever been told in my life. Do you need something? We don't like to complain ...but the coffee at breakfast this morning was cold. I'm sorry, ma'am, but I didn't make the coffee. Do you realize what Jean Louis and the other boys have endured for you? Fight for us, sacrifice for us. I'll talk to the cook, Mrs. Gauthier. Please do it, or I'll talk to Dr. Pearson. However you want. I'll talk to Dr. Pearson. No, I'll talk to the director of the hospital. What gratitude! Serve cold coffee to war heroes. Hi Michelle. - Good morning, doctor. - A threepence stamp, please. Do you want to know how my sister is feeling today? - No. - Good morning, Pearson. Paul, I didn't know you were back. An old husband should not leave his wife for a long time. Remember all the problems that Pen�lope had, ...fighting with all those men, when her husband went to war. I think ten years is a very long time to leave a woman. Sometimes it can all happen in ten days. Did your wife tell you about the letter you received? Yes, we have a habit of telling each other everything. Adem�s, ...I received a similar letter. With more details. Someone took advantage of my absence. This is no longer a joke. Frankly, I never thought it was. Don't think for a moment that we take the accusation seriously. But at the same time, we cannot forget it. Look, when I was young, ...spent part of my internship... ...in a hospital for the mentally ill, and, ...although I'm not an expert, ...I know quite a bit about psychopathic behaviors like... ...to know that a person who spreads poison in this way... ...she's sick, and she's dangerous. - Can you drive me to the hospital? - Of course. And if my diagnosis is correct, ...it would be possible that it was almost everyone in this city, ...including you, doctor. Why would I get in trouble myself? Does he not know that it is a symptom of psychopathology... ...act against oneself? It could even be Chevalier. - Good morning, Dr. Pearson. - Good morning. Have you sent anonymous letters lately? �Qu�? �Qu� dice? Oh, the good Dr. Laurent is kidding. According to your own theory, it is possible that it was you. It's true. I never thought about it. It could easily be me. I think we should just get rid of the cards. Whoever sent them will stop when they see that there is no response. Maybe. But from my experience in these things, ...usually get worse before they get better. "Yes no ends on relaci�n with Cora Laurent ... ...and leave the city, you will have to face the consequences." Dr. Pearson. Jean Louis Gauthier wants to see you today. In agreement. I'm going now. What's the problem, Jean Louis? They took my things. Who did it? - He thinks it was me. - I'll take care of it. What have they taken from you? I don't know. You are imagining things. The operation was a success. You are improving. I don't get enough rest. �Por qu� no? Last night, when I had just fallen asleep, she woke me up. It was time for his medicine. If you are asleep, forget your medicine. - But he said every four hours. - Also not to disturb his sleep. I didn't remember. Please remember it in the future. You'll sleep well tonight, and you'll feel better tomorrow. �S�, Pearson? I think you and Dr. Laurent need to take a look at Gauthier. The boy is starting to show signs of paranoia. Pearson. Jean Louis is the hero of this city. What will people think if the doctors say he's crazy? I didn't say I was crazy. I said to keep an eye on him. I'll talk to Laurent, but I think it's nonsense. If you believe that... Higgins, we have to do something about our friend Pearson. Did you get one of those letters in scarlet letter? - How do you know that? - Oh, everyone knows. This letter is very disturbing. "Dr. Helier, ...if you don't want the hospital to be involved in a scandal, ...I'll have to fire Dr. Pearson." - See? - I see nothing. Just a wacko. I hope you stand up for Pearson, being one of his few friends. Besides, it also mentions you. "Respecto a Higgins, ...ask him about the Hospital contract cuts last January." Go ahead, ask me. Oh, I don't accuse you of anything, ...but here there is a lot of smoke and little fire. Yes, now let me read this to you. - Do you have one too? - Yes. The first paragraph is about such topics as Pearson's morality, but the second paragraph is about you. "And the head doctor, who keeps as a member of the staff, ...is indiscreet in other respects. He shouldn't see his daughter alone in the office. She is underage." I hope you don't believe that. Say those things about me! A married man with five children! But as you say, where there is a lot of smoke... Higgins, you're right. Let us not pay attention to these letters. Let's just break them. The two? - Yes, both. - Okay. - �Doctor? - �S�? - Denise is very sick. - That's too bad. If you don't believe it, see for yourself. I was helping him cure the infection, ...but I think he prefers that you do it. �Ignorantes! Do you have something better to offer me? Do you want to spend your whole life in bed? I have a headache. Why didn't he tell Michelle to put the pots on his head? It would have been even more fun. You are an idiot. I think he managed to get a cold in the end. I must congratulate her. If I were his father, I would slap him. You have no respect. I don't understand how he could have become a doctor. In the same way as you to patient. With effort. I'll write you a prescription and give it to Michelle to go get. Unless you want to keep your headache. I hope whoever writes those letters keeps going until they run him out of town. How do you know about the letters? My sister works at the post office, remember? Oh. As for kicking me out of town, ...don't get your hopes up. Hello Doctor. I hope you don't mind. Michelle let me in. He told me he was treating his sister. And I did not want to interrupt such a pleasant task. Do you want to sit down? Wonderful collection. But why this concern about time? Isn't life short enough? Also, this must be very expensive to collect. Yes of course it is This one, for example. If you do not mind. It is an old Dutch model, and very delicate. Oh, s�. And this is my mission today. The hospital authorities want me to investigate, ...formally, of course, ...the matter of anonymous letters, ...which, unfortunately, is a very serious situation. So start by investigating the main victim. �Es il�gico? If I were assassinated ...certainly the first examination would be of his body. As the attack is direct to his person, ...it is my duty to invade your privacy. Sending those letters is a crime, so why not notify the police. Two good reasons. First, the hospital does not want this kind of publicity. And second, if the police know, ...I'm sure they make more mistakes than me. - Well, what have you learned so far? - About you? About the cards. That most people suspect my sister-in-law, ...Marie, ...because it is known that she disapproves of my wife, ...and he doesn't like you. Do you think he is guilty? Once she and I were engaged, ...so I know him well. I think he's innocent ...but that doesn't help. What does it mean? My friend, in times of uncertainty, ...any accusation is enough to establish a culprit. And now about you ...some idiots, ...don't try to guess who, there are many, ...have decided to ask some questions about you in London. The information says that you are... ...a good gynecologist, practicing successfully. And two years ago I left everything. Suddenly, it disappeared. Is it true? Yes, it is true. Well, since it's kind of an unusual circumstance,... Could you explain it? For these idiots I only mention it. No, I won't. I don't want to pressure you, doctor, ...but we will find explanations that you might want to deny. I'm not interested anyway. Well, it takes a long time to establish yourself as a doctor and practice. exercise successfully, ...and then walk away and leave it all behind. But I'm sure he must have had a good reason. I hope you don't mind that I came. Absolutely. I guess I should thank you. No, no, don't overdo it. - Good evening, doctor. - Goodnight. I have given you the recipe. ...give it to Michelle so she can go into town to buy it. Why is it up? Why don't you go back to bed? She won't be satisfied until she catches pneumonia. Maybe it's just one of his tricks. Come on, listen to me and go back to bed. Don't just stand there looking at me. You are a doctor and you have seen many lame people before. No, I have not seen her. When I wear my shoes, no one notices. What is the difference? Other men find me attractive ...even if you don't. With his hateful coldness, ...his air of superiority, ...and always judging. I'm sorry, Denise. I am so sorry. - So it's you? - Let me go. Djjeme is. - I was suspicious. - Let me go, please. I'll call the police first. - What are you talking about? - You know very well what I'm talking about. Do not be silly. I found the letter below. �D�nde? In the mailbox, where will it be. I was just trying to give it to you without waking you up. This letter has no stamp. Someone must have left it in the mailbox last night. Did you see someone? Do you think I'm up all night watching? I don't know what time you go to bed. Good... ...I went to bed last night after I went to see Denise, ...the second time. Adi�s, doctor. "If you want to meet me, come to church this afternoon at 8." �Est� busc�ndome? I have one just like it. - I'm scared. I must see him alone. - It is not a good idea. Please stay. I'm sure it's Marie. - His sister. - Yes. That day I went to his office, ...she told me there was something between us, ...as in the cards. That doesn't prove anything. Please Be Careful. Don't tell him what I've told you. In agreement. Pearson. Goodnight. Somehow I never would have suspected he went to church. Unless, of course, he was going to meet someone. Not his wife, if that's what you mean. I should have known he was our friend. He wants to divide us and turn us against each other. And I feel like we're falling into their trap. As if you had chosen this place to stay, ...especially when my wife knows... ...that I always pick her up here after choir rehearsals. Perd�neme, doctor. I don't blame him. Thank you. I guess there's no need to ask him if we found enough clues. Everyone is starting to look guilty. Everyone or no one. �Cora? You have come early. Yes, honey. But I wonder if not early enough. Dr. Pearson, Dr. Pearson... I wanted to ask you a favor. �S�? I hope you don't tell anyone you saw me at church tonight. I left the hospital without permission. It's my night watch. �Por qu� sali�? I wanted to confess. Are you sure that was all you wanted to tell me, Marie? S�, ...that was all. Between. I just wanted to say goodnight. Goodnight. �Solo? No. I do not believe you. You have watches for the same reason that... ...other people alone have cats. He winds them up and takes care of them. They don't want you. None of them. Are you trying to prove something? I know you better than yourself. If you like to say that. He didn't talk to me like that last night. Wouldn't it be better if we forget about last night? I saw you and Cora after church. Is that why we should forget it? Don't be ridiculous. It's not so ridiculous. After all there has to be some truth in those letters. In agreement. If you want to believe that maniac. What needs to be created? Something has changed him. Please tell me. I have not changed. But I have my own reasons for not wanting to be involved in this. With you or with anyone. I guess I should be thankful for your little favor. Perhaps he had a moment of humanity. Quiz� solo l�stima. Maybe he didn't feel anything. maybe, ...have no feelings. Maybe... Dr. Pearson speaking. �Qu�? When did it happen? Yes, I'll go right away. Jean Louis Gauthier, one of the hospital patients, ...has received one of those letters. He said he had an incurable cancer. The boy has cut his throat with a knife. citizens, ...we are here... ...to show our condolences to a young man, ...whose courage and bravery, ...have been an example to all. Our hearts are... ...with the mother of Jean Louis, ...in these times of pain. We will not forget the cause of your sorrow, ...the destruction of his son's honor, ...and now, his murder. I killed this poor woman's son, ...and acted like I injected him with poison... ...in his heart. I will hold the authorities responsible... ...of the administration of this city or of the hospital, ...if I find that they have been negligent, ...or have omitted their obligations, ...to safeguard our community... ...of this monstrous lunatic. as mayor, ...I am aware of my great duty. I promise... ...publicly investigate anyone... ...to protect this person in this city. Warning, ...it doesn't matter who you bother, ...will get to the bottom of the matter. First, I'll look into the death certificate. Why this young man... ...appeared on a temporary list of deranged? Was he really crazy? Or was it just to silence everything, ...and that the church participate in the funeral. And you, my clever friend, ...where was he hiding? That was his responsibility, right? I wanted to investigate, but, but... But, but, but... What? Why didn't you? What were you waiting for? The hospital authorities refused to cooperate. I deny the accusations about my son. We were advancing on our way. And what road is that? We put the investigation in the hands of Dr. Laurent. Since when is Dr. Laurent in the police department? Well, Mr. Mayor, I can assure you that I didn't want to get involved. At my age, a man tries to value his privacy, ...as I remember, said Cicero. Dr. Laurent, at the moment I am not interested in what Cicero said, ...but what you have to say about the cards. I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint you, ...I have very little to say. So all this time researching and you have nothing? I have developed a theory. Studying the cards ...detected a small variation in tone, ...which leads me to suspect... ...which may have more than one author. We now have a multitude of poison card writers. Quiz. There's a kind of madness ...known to students of abnormal behavior... ...como "Follie à deux", ...which means madness of two. Together, a disturbed person, ...somehow imposes his ideas... ...someone else. Someone close to her. Do you mean it's contagious? It can be. An idea can be contagious. But in this case, ...the second person, ...which is usually the weaker of the two, ...identifies with the first, and they act as one. Sir, in my opinion, that is a lot of nonsense. We all know that there is a person that we all suspect. The sister of Dr. Laurent's wife, Marie Corbin. The hospital authorities have not yet done anything about it. I protest the insinuations that I am hiding something in my son's case. The reasons are clear. She was related to three of the main victims. First, with his own sister. Second, with Dr. Pearson. Tercero, with Jean Louis Gauthier. Nothing had been done until I took matters into my own hands. Sir, Marie Corbin is being held outside on my orders. I ask your permission to enter the room. - Sir... - All right, let it happen. Ms. Corbin, sit here, please. Miss Corbin, ...you said you had... ...many differences with the deceased, ...Jean Louis Gauthier. It's true, isn't it? He was a difficult patient. The fact is that they argued. But surely they won't think I did such a horrible thing... ...because I had some differences with him. Please just answer my questions. Sorry. On the night of tragic death, ...you were supposed to be on duty... ...as a nurse in Jean Louis's room. S�. You knew he was depressed. I also knew he had a knife. But he left his post without permission, ...and came out at the exact time of the suicide. It was my mistake to leave my position without permission. I admit it. where was it? I told him. I went to confession. Why was it at that time exactly? I could have done it the next day. Why did you choose that night, being on watch? It was because I received this letter. "Marie Corbin, ...if you go to church tonight at 8, ...I'll find Dr. Pearson with his sister." Dr. Pearson. What do you have to tell us about this note? Any. Was he at church at 8 the night of the suicide? Yes, I was. Was Ms. Corbin in at that time? Yes, I saw her leaving the confessional. This is an embarrassing question, doctor. �Qued� with Sra. Laurent? Yes, there you go. It seems to me, sir, that is enough for today. I was also in church that night. I found Dr. Pearson and we chatted a bit. I can assure you that he did not go there to meet my wife. Naturally, Dr.Laurent, we are very confident... ...on Dr. Pearson and his wife. But her sister-in-law is something else. I'm afraid I'll have to order her stopped. But I didn't write those letters. You must believe me. I did not do it. I have nothing to do with it. You will be charged with criminal mischief. Yes, Mr. Mayor. - Mr. Mayor. - Yes? I don't know anything about laws, ...but I don't understand how Ms. Corbin can be charged... - ...no evidence. - No evidence? You have heard the convincing evidence. - They don't convince me. - I think the same. What about the letter Marie received? She wrote a letter to herself to avoid suspicion. That seems hard to believe and quite unlikely. I do not think so. Caballero, exc�seme, ...but I'm not interested in debating the questions anymore. I have made a decision. Sergeant, please arrest Ms. Corbin. She will be taken to prison, without bail. Y... ...will have no access to pencil or paper. It will only be a few minutes. I do not mind waiting. It's what it takes to travel with a doctor. Hello Mrs. Bredet. Dr. Pearson. How is Juliette? Oh, you're much better, doctor. In fact, he was out to see some friends. Yesterday I had quite a fever. But you know how children are. Bad one day and good the next. - I tried to call you... - Can you come in for a moment...? Pearson. �C�mo est�? I'm sorry, Dr. Pearson. Juliette is very pleased with you, and... ...we know he is a very good doctor. But understand, - ...all this stuff... - Good morning, Mrs. Bredet. Do you have fire? Are you worried about Mrs. Bredet? Not for Mrs. Bredet, especially. If this continues, I'll have to go. I will not continue. People like you. They know you are a good doctor. If the lie is repeated, in the end it becomes the truth. No one is sure, but... ...a doctor is much more vulnerable. Once the scandal invades his private life, he's done. Do you mind if I ask you a question? Ahead. Why did you change your job in London... ...for coming to a place like this? �Ves? You heard the rumors too. But I didn't believe them. It was for my marriage. My wife is dead. We got married very young, without knowing each other very well. She probably didn't know how to be a doctor's wife. Especially that of a very busy doctor who was never home. She was lonely, I guess. In any case, he fell in love. Or I thought she did. She left me and went to live with him for a while. And when they broke up ...he asked me to come back. I couldn't forget what he did to me. What I really couldn't do was forgive her. And I told him no. He left and shortly after he called me on the phone. He asked me to come back again. The colleague. I apologize to myself no more than I apologize to her. The following week he was admitted to the hospital, ...with an overdose of sleeping pills. It was too late to save her. That was a long time ago. I was shattered. I couldn't continue working and couldn't do anything. He just went from one side to the other. Then slowly I found that I wanted to work again. This seemed far enough. I was starting to think it was the perfect place... ...when these letters began. Y Denise. Y Denise. No one gets letters anymore since Marie was taken away. Everyone but you seems to appreciate it. - Here, honey. - Thanks. Brothers and Sisters, ...we are here this morning... ...with the special feeling of gratitude... ...for having freed us from that demon, ...which spread over us, ...like a plague from ancient times. Covering with its shadow all of us, ...separating parents from children, ...neighbors of neighbors. With God's help, ...we stop, ...and we examine our own hearts, ...searching for our sins, ...hidden from God, ...and of ourselves. So, God, ...in his infinite goodness will purify us. And at the same time, ...will set us all free ...of the miserable author of the letters. Now our hearts ...freed from fear, ...should go to him, grateful. "Marie Corbin and I are different people. I will continue cleaning the city, ...until I finally free her from Pearson." And the same signature. He doesn't even respect the church. Apparently we made a mistake with Marie Corbin. A mistake, really. I had no right to arrest her at first. What is done, is done. I will be released right away. Oh I see. Put that poor woman in jail, ...and now he lets her go. - That's very generous of you. - Well, I... In any case, we are back to where we started. Only now we have something to start with. This piece of paper... ...fell from the choir. It couldn't have come from anywhere else. And only 18 people were there. The same 18 people that are in front of me. You can't accuse us like that. It's nonsense. One of us would have seen it. S�, ...some of you must have seen it. Then we would tell him, right? Yeah, unless they're protecting the culprit. Why should we want to protect the guilty? That's what I'm going to find out. You'll hear from me later. Mr. Mayor, can I speak with you? And so, to determine which of the 18 people... ...of this table is the author of the letters, ...we have decided to do a test. Before you start it, ...will give the guilty one last chance to confess. Okay, Dr. Laurent, ...expl�quelo. The test is very simple. I will dictate... ...some of these anonymous letters, ...they will copy them... ...on the sheets in front of you. In capital letters. Of course, we know that the culprit... ...I'll try to hide his handwriting. It is difficult to do without having practiced. As they say. Now, ...I join the sergeant... ...by asking the culprit to say who he is, ...save us all this time needed to do the test, ...and confess. �S�? I protested before, ...and I do it now, ...against this humiliation. - Me too. - Me too. Okay, okay. I'm sorry, but the innocent will have to put up with it... ...to help us find the culprit. Please pick up your pen. Card # 1: "Sra. Laurent: I'm watching you and Pearson. ...and Pearson. Stop before it's too late." I'm done, doctor. I didn't know you were working here, Mrs. Gauthier. The doctor put me here. Now that my son's pension is over, ...I have to find my life. Also, I think... ...that my son's killer is not far from the hospital. �No? Why do you think that? Jean Louis was all I had, and now I've lost it. When you lose something you love, it makes you think. I've thought a lot ...and I have my suspicions. What do you suspect? I won't say anything until I'm sure. But you will know soon enough. Here is the letter, ...that they sent my son. "Jean-Louis Gauthier, ...Dr. Pearson, who is treating you, ...lies to you... ...as he does to his friend's wife. He has not told you the truth. The truth is... ...that you have cancer. But it's already too late." That's the razor my son used. Rest in peace. Sra. Gauthier, Can I save it for you? Don't worry, doctor. I don't suspect you. Good evening, Dr. Pearson. Goodnight. "...The dar... ...an opportunity... ...to leave the city." That's all for tonight. Thanks a lot. Thank you for your cooperation. Can I go back to my office? I prefer to study them first. - We'll see you tomorrow. - I'll call you in the morning. Goodnight. Oh, Dr. Laurent. �S�? I know who wrote those letters. Good. Do you promise to protect me? Okay, give it to me. Es Robert Elliot. What...? But... �Michelle! - You better go home. - No, I'll wait for you. Go home. I'll be with you in a few minutes, honey. I want to talk to Dr. Pearson. - Oh, tell him I'll wait for him. - Of course. Denise. I wanted to talk to you a long time ago. But I was delaying it... ...because it's not very nice. �S�? If I tell you this, it is for your own good. I know how silly that sounds. It concerns a man and two women. What man? What are you trying to tell me? I'm afraid I did it wrong. And that you are going to be angry. Please, Ms. Laurent, d�gamelo... ...and I will decide whether to get angry or not. It's about Dr. Pearson. I can't take it anymore. Watching you get wrapped up more and more and there is no hope... I don't know what to say. Finish what you have started. He will never marry you. Never. That doesn't concern you. But I thought you'd know about us. yours? You and Pearson. Good. With all these cards, it's not exactly a secret. I can not believe it. You must be so in love with him... ...to be so blind. you are lying It's all an invention. Everything. I thought so ...and decided it would be better to say it to your face. And what about your husband? I suppose it would be better if he knew it too. As far as he knows, I am a good wife. And so I am, ...as much as he needs it. The first is the anonymous letter, ...the second was written by Denise tonight. Although different pens were used in the test, ...the similarities are unmistakable. This is absurd. - It can't be Denise. - You can see it with your own eyes. The papers could be misplaced. Look, it's her name, Denise Turner. I was very careful examining them. Well, I'll have to talk to her. Pearson, I'm an old... ...and the only thing I want is to be healthy. I thought that if you were going to get married, ...you should know this information, ...before giving it to the idiot, ...Robert Helier. But I have no intention of getting married. Denise is not a vicious person. Even if he did, ...there has to be some explanation, ...something on his mind... In that case, everything can be excused. No one can be blamed for anything. Excuse me, doctor, but you are a bit rigid, ...judging quickly. Believe that people are good or bad. A�n as�, ...the good and the bad can change places, ...like light and shadows. How can we be sure... ...where does one end and another begin? Or which side we are on at any given moment. It's very simple. Let's stop the light. �Lo and? Come on, doctor. Denise couldn't wait for him. He asked me to tell you, doctor. - Thanks. - Do you see, doctor? The advantages of having a wife. It's all much firmer. What are you writing? - Nothing you care about. - Give me the letter. - No, I won't give it to you. - Oh, yes you will. - Get out of my room. - Not before seeing what you've written. Come on, Denise. Demela. No. Do not touch me. �We thank you too! �We thank you too! again! What does this mean? What has Mrs. Laurent told you? As if you didn't know. Please go away and leave me alone. I don't know, Denise. I have no idea what this letter means. Are you going to deny that you have an affair with her? That you met her when he turned his back? Did he tell you that? It's something you didn't count on. - When did he tell you? - Tonight. Denise, you must believe me. Is not true. Why did you tell me that? She must be crazy. No idea, unless... ...that she's crazy. I'm going out. - At this time of night? - I have to talk to Dr. Laurent. For the rest, ...you were right to bite me. This time I deserved it. Oh, entre, doctor. I want to be with you for a few minutes. - I know it's late. - Absolutely. Cora and I are nocturnal animals. Cora saw you from the window. He is preparing coffee. If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to you alone. Oh very well. We can talk in my office. Please sit down. Good. I just talked to Denise, ...and he has sworn to me that he has not written the letters. Surely he wouldn't expect her to admit it. I know you are not lying. Then you must know her very well. I must say I wouldn't be so sure about my wife. Since you said it, I agree with you, ...as far as his wife is concerned. It's starting to get hard to follow. This afternoon, Mrs. Laurent gave a speech to Denise... ...without the slightest basis in truth. If I had, I wouldn't be here telling you this. His wife said, ...que ten�amos a business. - Cora said that? - Yes. I know what you're thinking. If I could tell you how many nights I've spent... ...waiting for this moment. Sooner or later it had to arrive. People who are mentally unstable, ...no matter how well you hide it, ...in the end she does things like this, which in the end give her away. So it's your wife? In the beginning, ...when the letters began, ...I thought of almost everyone. Even in you, remember? But my own wife. If you don't want to talk now. Nerd. It is better to tell him everything. Sometimes it seemed so unbelievable, that... ...I almost doubted my head. A d�a, ...when he returned early from the hospital, ...I caught him writing those letters. He asked me not to say it. He promised me he wouldn't do it again. I created her Perhaps because I wanted to believe him. She seemed to realize... ...how horrible it was what he had done. For a few days, if you remember, ...the letters stopped, ...and started again. I was really worried. And I didn't know what to do. She couldn't let them find out. Y... ...s�, ...I started to protect him. Even to the point of allowing his sister to go to jail? Yes, even that. And tonight you swapped your wife's letter for Denise's, right? It would have been cleared up later, ... like with Marie. Do you think it was okay to do that? Here we are again, Pearson. Good or bad. All that said, it doesn't matter if the person you love... ...more than anything in the world... ...can be taken from you. A man of my age has little left to live for, ...when he's lucky to have a wife, ...a beautiful young woman, ...and betrays him. More than a young man can understand. But, as a doctor, you know you need treatment. Yes... but in whose hands... ...is there the best chance to be cured? In unknown doctors and institutions, ...or a husband who loves and understands you? It should be obvious that he is not improving under your care. It's true. I was giving him time. Time for... ...to find the key to open your mind, ...freeing him from those terrible thoughts... ...that controlled her. What I'm going to tell you now... ...you can't reveal it even to your close friends. So I trust you will keep it under medical secrecy, ...keeping it that way, secret. Of course. The first year, ...after we got married, ...was the happiest of my life. Then gradually ...age differences began to appear. Cora was young, ...Y... ...recovering my own youth was impossible. So it wasn't surprising... ...when I caught him... ...looking at other men. Yes, there were others before you, doctor, ...but when he arrived, ...she was not able to control her actions. Wait a moment. If that's true, the cards were working against their purposes. His intentions were to run me out of town. He knows, ...for a long time that intrigued me too. I soon found out. The letters had the function of putting you in contact. At the same time, she wasn't being unfaithful to me. You were the object of his love, but also... ...the memory of his own feelings of guilt. She had to prove herself... ...two contrary things: that could attract him, ...and who could be without you. I don't have to tell you, as a doctor, ...that conflict can destroy any mind. My wife was the victim of circumstances... ...that he couldn't control. I failed her as a husband, ...and now as a doctor. I don't know how to change it. All I ask of you is... ...to do what's best for her. Naturally, it has to be treated. I suggest you bring her in immediately. I can not. I can't put my name on the admission papers. Otherwise, I'll go to prison, like Marie. I can not do it. Could you do it for me? I know it is a great favor that I ask of you. In agreement. I go to the hospital and tell them to send a car. You can bring your things later. We'll put you in a temporary room for observation... ...and then we'll decide what to do. Pearson, you're talking to an old... ...which at this time does not have enough words of thanks. Are not necessary. Between. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon doctor. Can you wait outside, nurse? I have to talk to Mrs. Laurent. M�reme, Cora. I am his friend. I want you to trust me. Your husband told me all about the letters. What did he tell you? That's not important, Cora. I didn't believe almost anything he said. He made me write the letters. At least, at first. That's what I thought. But why did he do it? I don't know. He told me that you never looked at me, ...and that the young boys didn't like it. He told me that I was pretty, but that I had ice in my veins. He always said that I was lucky to have married him, ...because no one else would have. When we were going to dance, ...he told me that men only asked me to dance because I was his wife. How long has she been married? Almost six years. Ten�a 19. How did you meet him? It was promised to my sister. They left him, and he started calling me. But Marie was furious. I think he married me out of spite. Was she in love with him? How could I be? If it could be my father. After a while, I couldn't bear to have him touch me. He started saying that I was cold. I kept repeating it over and over again. I used to cry before sleeping. I was afraid that he was right and that it was my fault and not his. I really didn't mean to do any harm. No escrib� esa carta a Jean Louis Gauthier. I don't know anything about that letter. Please believe me. How did it all start? When you came to town, ...I wanted him to notice me, ...but he didn't pay attention to me. I was afraid to think too much about you, ...because he was a doctor and could read my thoughts. That was what he said. Where did that come from? I don't know. From Marie, perhaps. I don't know. He told me that letters were the only way to get him out of my mind. If I wrote about it, ...putting my thoughts on paper, ...it would be like perjuring myself. I was foolish. It gave me the excuse to see him. I shouldn't have done what I did. If I'm going to help you, you'll have to tell me everything. - Do you want to help me? - Yes. Then I wrote some letters without his knowledge. At first, they were about you. The time we met in the choir, remember, ...was next to me in the dark of the church. He touched my hand, as he read the letter. I knew it by heart, ...but I read it again, when he gave it to me. Then he came. He knew that I had written it, and he told me not to do it again. I only had to write what he dictated to me. And it destroyed my wonderful afternoon. - But you sent the letters. - Yes. He couldn't stop me. I sent them to everyone. I wanted everyone to know about us. You didn't care, did you? Don't think I'm a bad person. I think she is sick and needs someone to take care of her. But I can't stay here. will find me No. You won't be able to get in. I promise you. Once free of it, you can heal yourself. Now try to sleep. Come to meet me. Yes, Cora. I will come as often as I can. �No me olvidar�? No, I won't be able to forget him. Excuse me, nurse. Nurse. I don't want anyone to enter Mrs. Laurent's room, ...unless it is in the presence of a doctor. Absolutely nobody. - Is that clear? - Yes, doctor. Sister, can you call Robert Helier, the prosecutor? Call until I pick you up. I'll be in my office. I will, doctor. �Dr. Laurent? �Laurent? Let's take a look at your office. - Is he dead? - Yes. With the police station, please. I should have been writing this when it happened. "To the people of this town. Anonymous letters are over. This is the last letter that..." You have nothing to worry about, Mrs. Bredet. I'll tell Rochelle to buy the medicine for you and send it to you quickly. Thank you, doctor, thank you. It's wonderful that he came back and forgave us, ...after how we behave. - It's fine. Just keep Juliette in bed for a few days. I will be back again on Monday. Goodbye. Thank you Doctor. Thank you. How is the patient? Good. �C�mo est�s t�? Fine, thanks.
