"You don't look right"? "You see nothing!" -It was fucking clear. - I was downstairs. It is not right! It is too hot. Too hot! Too hot! Timo! Timo! You were there! Why didn't you warn me? He told me not to... Timo, cut the power! Mohamed, the engine's gonna blow! Mary, Mother of God! Come in. We must speak with the Canadians, tell them about the mess going on here. Timo... You heard what they said? We'll only get paid once the ship is released. Exactly! For once, we've got them by the balls. They pay or we give everything to the authorities. They don't give a damn. You've been here how long? Ten years? I just got here. I'll be the one to get sacked. Why? You've got nothing to fear. You did your job? I didn't do my second round that night. A second round to check what? Listen, maybe you're right. This time, we won't let it go. We must raise a stink. Thanks. Shepherd's pie, hot dog? The same thing. Shepherd's pie, hot dog? Shepherd's pie, hot dog? Seriously, I'm starting to wonder if they're even gonna call me. What'd they tell you? Two, three weeks? I'm getting sick of always waiting like this. I'd look for something more stable real fast. Seems they're looking for places to put up the sailors. Don't you have an extra room at your place? Yeah, but you know how my place is. And with the little one there... Does it pay well? Not too bad. Don't you want a nice big Russian to keep you company? No thanks. Everything OK? I ran out of the little jars. I couldn't feed him supper. What's wrong, my angel? Oh yes, come here... What made you so late? There was some big emergency at the shipyard today. It was crazy. Fifty guys came in at the last minute. Yes, my love... Know what, Fanny? I have a life too. You can't just show up at any hour. It's not that bad. I'm meeting Brigitte at 6:00h. What am I gonna do? Take a taxi again? Let's face it, it's not that stressful. You've got lots of time. The bars stay open till 3:00. Fanny Ouellette, that's none of your business. I don't judge how you live. Oh no? You gotta take responsibility. That's what having a child means. What you gonna do when he's in daycare, huh? Tell me. Stop bugging me about that. I've barely finished wiping your ass and now I've gotta wipe your son's ass! Yeah, well, you've got nothing else to do! Anyway, thanks, mother, for taking care of my son today. Don't worry about next week. I'll figure it out. What you looking at, the light? Here is your cheque. And they explained the conditions and payments? They explained everything. I've got all the papers here. If there's any problem, call us, OK? Well, you're all set! OK, see you at the shipyard. - Yeah, thanks. - OK, bye. Good luck! You can come in. Well, I'm Fanny. I'm Traoré. Take off your boots. I'll show you around. Follow me. Well then, this is your room. You can move the boxes if you want. There's nothing valuable. This is the bathroom. Listen, it's pretty simple. You do your own dishes and laundry. If you've got to call long distance, you can buy calling cards at the store on the corner. My son goes to bed pretty early, so be careful to keep the noise down at night. For the food, I know the company pays you something, so you can eat here. But mostly, you'll eat at the shipyard's cafeteria. Well, I'm gonna go change my guy. Get yourself settled. Excuse me, mister, can you come over here? For you. We're off. It's for you. I'm going to work and taking the little one to his sitter. OK, I'm just going to put my things away and then I have to get back to the shipyard. OK. You know the way? I think so. It's not hard. When you go out, turn left. Go to the end of the street and you'll see the cranes. If it's too cold, there's the bus. The 21. But it doesn't go by often. I think I'll follow the cranes. In the name of the Father who separated water from sky and the Son who tramples and calms the storm and of the Holy Spirit who soars over the oceans. Virgin Mary, Queen of the Seas, in whom sailors keep faith, see at your feet your sons who wish to rise up to you. Amen. Albert Mabri Taoré... Traoré. What exactly is your position on board? I'm the second engineer. For how long? Eight years. I was a regular sailor for the 10 years before that. - And then... - Right! You were there when the accident happened, right? You were on watch. Yes. Can you tell me, in your own words, what happened? The question is: what did they tell you happened on the ship? OK. The chief engineer maintains that the incident is, without a doubt, due to human error... and not the fault of maintenance. It's a bit vague. Were you present during these repairs? We didn't have access to the shipyard. I think they just gave it a new coat of paint. We know this ship owner. We already have a file this thick on these guys. As soon as there's an incident on a ship and the Coast Guard has to intervene, there's an investigation. We'll inspect the engine the whole ship, account books, logbook, everything. So help us. Help yourself. Tell me what you know. Repeatedly, I pointed out to the chief engineer, Petoukh, that the valves were worn down. And if he claims that it was a human error, well, it wasn't made by me or my team. So... You can't make something new out of something old. They needed to buy the parts and they didn't do it. It's been eight weeks since we were last paid. Not a cent. What you're saying is very serious. Serious enough for us to not allow the Diego Star to set sail for the time being. You just need to give him some milk with the pureed carrots. Yes, he likes it. Mrs. Bourgeois, I don't have a choice. No, 50 guys are coming in tomorrow morning. I really can't leave. Yes, I understand. What about your show? Well, can't you tape it? Yes. Anyway, I should be back by 9:00 at the latest. Yes. No, I don't think I'll be late. OK. Yes, 9:00. Thank you. Have a good evening. I'm gonna go do the prep. He orders this thing called Carnivore's Delight. He thought it was gonna be some kind of steak. So it comes and, Christ, it's huge. Check it out. This big. It's, like, raw ground meat with an uncooked egg in it. Yeah, that's steak tartare. I wouldn't eat it. Neither would he. He left it all there. Christ, 55 bucks. Hamburger disease! - You won't get that here anyway. - Good thing! I've tried it. It was made with game meat. Where are the damn buns? And if the meat is fresh, no worries. You eat that raw meat stuff? Well, if you made it, maybe I'd eat it. Here, for you! What you doing after your shift? Welcome home. Hey. You have to sleep. Albert Mabri Traoré. Why does this bullshit with the engine always happen in some shitty country? Why doesn't the engine ever break down in Brazil or in the Caribbean? For the cabin. Does it still work? Well, they're selling it. Listen, I'm $30 short. Can you lend it to me? It's a good deal, I swear. Think of all the movies we could watch, for $30. It's nothing! Listen, as soon as we get paid, I'll pay you back. Here. I'll lend it to you, but watch yourself. Hi. To thank you for welcoming me into your lovely home. You know, the company pays for you. Seriously, it's really not necessary. How you doing? You like it? What's this? Why are you looking at me like that? The Turk wants to know if it's our fault, being stuck here. What's going on? I don't know. They've really got something against our black asses. Now you're black? They're just scared. We all know this old hull is falling apart, but when we go up top, inshallah, we've got to work. Yes, but why is the Turk blaming us? Because we were below when the engine busted. Because after you spoke with the inspector, he didn't question anyone else. The Turk and the others find this strange. Why not speak to the captain? You ever speak to the captain alone, without Petoukh? The captain doesn't want all this to fall on his head! Exactly! Petoukh spoke with the Turk. He said that we'll get paid by Thursday if we tell Petoukh's version to the Canadians. Mohamed? Mohamed! Mohamed! What did you say to the Canadians? The truth. Isn't that what you wanted? We'll get paid if we keep our mouths shut! Keep our mouths shut? And let them say it was all our fault? Timo, never in my life! Never! Here you go. Goodbye. Hello! They told me to come here when we put up sailors. - You're here for your cheque? - Yes. Do you have your paper? - This? - Yes, that's it. Here you go. Sign right here. Yes. Thanks. That's all? That's all. See you next week! - Thanks. - Goodbye. Hello, my dear. I've got some shopping to do. Hello, Mom. I was wondering how Jérémie is. I haven't seen him in a while. So how's it going? With that big ship, there must be lots of action in the shipyard. Yeah, I guess. This is Traoré. Hello, madame. Grandma Lise is here. My mother. Pleased to meet you. Want some tea or coffee? He's one of the guys from the boat? Of course. He pays to be here. You leave him alone with the baby? He's not alone. I'm here. You don't know him. You don't know what he might do. Yeah... Why is he a bad guy? Why is everyone always bad in your books? Give it here. I'll help you. Thanks. Where's the little one? Wow! How'd you do that? Maybe I put a spell on him. I made kedjenou, a celebratory dish. It just has to cook for one more hour and we're ready. Smells great. What are we celebrating? Nothing. Actually... the birthday of my oldest son, Gabriel. He turns 17 today. Did you call him to wish him a happy birthday? No. I don't know how to reach him. He doesn't live at home anymore. A sailor's life is like that. We don't see our sons grow up. When we come back on land, we find a woman who's remade, rearranged her life in her own way and sons who've become men. Yeah. Maybe you'll see them soon. No, that's not for sure. It's complicated. Why? The work's not progressing? Yes, but it's returning to sea that worries me. Must be hard work. I didn't really choose this work, but I can help my family live with dignity. I have a house in Abidjan. My sons go to school. It's the snowblower. Petoukh paid everyone, yes. I lent you $30. It's all I've got left. I sent it all back home. Oh yeah? Your folks are well, and what am I supposed to do? You should've shut up. - What? - That's right. No one asked you to do anything. You shut up, keep your head down and wait for the storm to pass. Right, no one asked me anything, did they? That's right! You were all happy that I defended you, weren't you? Keep your head down, shut up. That's all you know how to do! You bastards. And you! You agreed that we shouldn't let it go. And now you're playing their game. - You shouldn't be so proud. - You son of a bitch! Get away from me! If I could do something for you, I would! Get out of here! Can't sleep, little man? Just can't sleep? Come on... Come now. Hush. You shouldn't wake up your mom. Wait a minute. Your pass isn't working. How can it not work? It worked fine yesterday. You're in the system, but... Hold on. You can go. Hello. Give me your pass again. Won't be long. Wait for me. Again! What you doing? Come on! Come on! Don't you have mittens? - What? - Mittens. Gloves, for your hands. I forgot them. I guess they're not that useful in Africa! You all right? I'm fine. Maybe the snow makes me look off. All right if I drop you here? I've got to drop off the little one. See you in the cafeteria at lunch? OK. Yeah, maybe. We'll see, if there's not too much work. Traoré? Yes? Coming! - How's it going? - Fine, thanks. And you? Fine. You wanna take the little one? Hi, big guy. Listen, Traoré... It's my friend Sylvie's birthday tonight. Maybe you've seen her. She works with me, short brown hair. Yes. Well, she'd like to go grab a beer tonight. So I was just wondering if maybe you could watch Jérémie. Be happy to, Fanny. Cool. OK then, I got you a meat pie and coleslaw. Just 15 minutes in the oven, like it says. I got some baby food for the little one. Meat, then fruit for dessert. Thanks. Shit, shit, shit! - Learn what? - Learn to lose, it's important. Whose turn is it? Sylvie? No, I just played, so it's you! Me? OK. Sorry, my bad. Oh, wait, maybe I've got a chance to do something. - There? - I think so. - Did you play? - Yep. And nothing happened. My turn! You put her in a tight spot. Look. Bye, I'm taking off. - You're leaving? - Yeah. - Happy birthday, sweetie. - Thanks. Good night. Hey, you're not so cool. You're hot. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. You're not gonna leave me like this, are you? What you want me to do? Don't know. Looks like it's gonna be takeout. Come here. - No, stop it. - It's OK. He just shut his door. No, stop. Let go. - What you doing? - Stop. Please go. Come on, open your mouth wide. Come on, Jérémie. Mama got home a bit late last night. You know, sometimes mama needs to have some fun. Come on, open your mouth. Jérémie, open your mouth. Want a ride? I'm leaving in five minutes. No thanks. I'm gonna walk a bit and get some air. Have a nice day. There's no cheque for you. How can that be? Says here your boarder's been suspended by his company. It happened last wWednesday. We can't pay you for his board for the moment. That can't be. Since Wednesday... He was at home this morning. We need to wait and see if they'll keep him or fire him. Come on! I can't do anything today. Until the company decides what they'll do with the guy... we can't pay you. What the hell am I supposed to do in the meantime? He lives at my house and eats at my house! We could send you another sailor. There's one waiting for a place. That's all right. When you finish with the vegetables, can you come help me? OK. So? Not too hungover this morning? Bonehead... Francis told me. Your sailor shouldn't be giving you attitude. - You go out with who you want. - It's none of your business! Why do you all want to get involved in my life? I feel sick and tired. I'm going home. Jérémie, stop it! Leave it. Leave it! Open your mouth. I think you've had enough, big boy. Come play with me. No, it's fine. I'll handle it. So how's work? Making progress? Yes, it's going OK. I haven't seen you in the cafeteria at lunch. No, there's been too much work. Put him to bed. I'll clean up. Yes? When were you thinking of telling me you lost your job? You thought I wouldn't notice? The shipyard's stopped paying for you. What were you thinking? No problem, don't say a word to the girl. Just live off of her then take off to Africa! I'm not gonna let any more assholes screw me over! You come under my roof and lie to my face! You think I need this shit? You think I need you? Fanny, you're wrong to think you can do all this all alone. You're one to talk. You think I didn't notice you making phone calls on the sly? Your friends don't want to hear from you. The company believes it's my fault. It's probably true if they kicked you out. If this is about money, how much does the company pay you per week for me? $100? $200? Here, be my guest! Sir... Sir! I tell you the truth, and you help me. Tell me what? We haven't entered the Mediterranean for at least five years. The work in Malta was never done. All the payslips were falsified. Petoukh is about to... Listen... I've just had a long meeting with the Captain All the other sailors have given the same version, except you. It's just you making these allegations. But you know full well that it's the truth. What's going to happen to me? Well, I don't know, sir. I'm not a union. My job is to know what happened on the ship. So you think you know what happened! Or maybe you've stepped in a pile of shit? I'm not sure you're aware of all that's at stake. I have to go. Come by my office tomorrow. But I can't go into the shipyard anymore! I can't! We'll talk tomorrow. Go home! That's right! It would suit you well if this ship left as soon as possible! Who gives a damn what happens as long as it's somewhere else? Shit! Shit! Fanny? Fanny? Thank you. WORK AND CONSTRUCTION Son of a bitch! Ham? Sausages? Can you take over for two minutes? Excuse me... Excuse me! Do you know where he is? I don't know. I haven't seen him in a few days. What happened? It's not his fault. He had nothing to do with it. Give this to him. I owe him. I have brought shame upon myself. May Allah forgive me. What happened? Hey, where is he? I must get on that ship. Let me pass. You can't pass, sir. Company orders. I must get on my ship! The Diego Star! OK, let the others pass, please. You can go, guys. I must get on that ship! What don't you understand? It's not your ship anymore. They kicked you off. You can't pass! I must get on that ship! You can't do this, sir. You're not allowed, sir. What the hell's your problem? He's heading into the woods. I'm sorry, but your boarder has been arrested. They took him to Montreal. What'll they do with him? He'll be tried, then, most likely, deported from Canada. In the end, the company changed their mind. They'll pay you for your sailor for the last two weeks and... for the inconvenience.
