VALDERA SURVIVORS LAND IN NEW ORLEANS Philip Calvin, Batavian oil operator and wife lost in tragedy; Leslie Calvin their daughter, among those rescued Did you ever go to a funeral where the minister forgot the sermon? Did you? And the man next to you died as they threw him overboard? And all that you thought was there will be more water to drink. And you didn't care if he was dead. And a sailor got up and said Oh, God, we consign this soul to your keeping and the body to thee. And he couldn't remember any more. And then one beside you says 'deep'???????? Actually you're almost well now. Have you ever thought about what you're going to do after you leave the hospital? Do you have any friends or relatives to go to? An uncle and aunt; my mother's sister. Live in New York. Would you know their address? My mother told me to write her if anything happened. Then do it. Right away. But I don't know them. I haven't seen them. I don't even know what they look like. What difference does that make? They'll certainly be anxious to hear from you. Oh, but Dr. Winter, there's so much to be said. I... Tell you what I'll do all the explaining. You just write a note to enclose. Now What is the name? Mrs. Norbert Lamont 1059 Freemont Building New York City Good morning. Have you eaten everything? I'm not hungry. Maybe this will give you an appetite. Who is it from? Probably from your aunt and uncle. But it's not postmarked from New York. Belleville, Louisiana. Why don't you open it and find out? It is. It's from Aunt Emily. It must have been forwarded from New York. They're in Belleville; an estate called Rosignol. What do you know? Belleville's only about 90 miles away. Go on. Read it. What does it say? They want me. They want me to come! Of course they do. Go on. Are you surprised to find us here? Norbert's grandfather left him an estate years ago. But of course we never lived here. And now with the children away we decided to come down and look it over. And we are just camping out but I'm going to have your room ready for you. And you must be sure and let us know. Is that all one sentence? My darling sister would want us to take care of you, I know. But you must stay in the hospital until you're quite well, of course. The doctor tells us how ill you've been. Alright, miss, this is Belleville. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, darling. All aboard! - Looking for someone, young lady? - Yes. Mr. and Mrs. Lamont. I thought they'd be here to meet me. Lamont? - Lamont. - Mr. and Mrs. Norbert Lamont. Never heard of them. But they live here. They have a place called Rosignol Plantation. Rosignol? Oh, that's over on Bayou Brantere. But I never heard of Mr. and Mrs. Lamont. She got off the 248 from New Orleans. Seemed kind of surprised no one was here to meet her. Well, hello. Hey, not so fast, young lady. Lie still and take deep breaths. This is a doctor; Dr. Grover. That's right. - Have I fainted? - All in a heap. Too much sun. But you'll be alright as soon as I get you out of this slab-sided oven. That's enough, Lee. There you are. Now you lie quiet for a while then I'll take you over to my office where it's cool. No. And then off to Rosignol No. No, I've got to go back. There's no train till late this afternoon, miss. 7:14 And it's usually late. I have to go back. Don't tell me you came all this way just to turn around? I must. But aren't the Lamonts expecting you? I don't know. They don't know me. They don't want me. I'm choosing to go back. Well, if you want to go back, alright. But you can wait in my office till time for the next train. Can't I stay here? That would be a pretty long wait. You better come along, Miss Calvin. Drink this. Slowly and in small sips. People who just came out of the hospital should take everything that way. How do you know I'd been in the hospital? Oh, I know quite a bit about you. You know the Lamonts, you're just out of the hospital, and you're on your way to Rosignol. - You know my aunt and uncle? - Only by name. Finish your medicine. I picked up the things that fell out of your purse when you fainted. There was a letter addressed to you at the Courtland Hospital in New Orleans Feel better? - Yes, thanks. - I thought you would. You shouldn't feel so upset about fainting on the platform. The heat was enough to flatten anybody. It wasn't only the heat or that I'd been ill. It was... It was the fear of being all alone. Of having no one to turn to. Not anyone. You see, my aunt and uncle are my only relatives. And they're perfect strangers. I haven't even seen them. Then they weren't at the station, I thought they'd gone back to New York. They'd hardly do that if they thought you were coming. You ought to like Rosignol. It's a perfect place to convalesce after After whatever it was you were in the hospital for. I was on the Valdera. I read about the Valdera. Only four of us survived. I woke up in a hospital in New Orleans. I'm constantly tormented by the nightmare of the open boat. I thought it would drive me insane. I was afraid someday it would be the same whether I was awake or not. I wanted to give in. But they forced me back. Dr. Winter wrote to my aunt and they said they wanted me. But they weren't at the station. Why don't we take my car and drive out to see what happened? I've got a call to make out that way. If they're not there, I'll get you back in time for the train. You're very kind. You won't be able to see the water from Rosignol; too many trees between. Trees and sunlight... It's so quiet, you can almost hear it. Dr. Winter said all I needed was some rest and quiet. You'll have plenty of that. It's about all we get around here. Sometimes I think we overdo it. The only excitement is when a visitor comes to town. I think I'll drop by Rosignol every day or so. But I wouldn't think of troubling you so. Trouble? It's the kind of trouble everybody's looking for. But don't forget I saw you first. Here we are. There's Rosignol How do you do? Are you Mr. Lamont? No, my name is Sydney. I'm staying here. I'm Dr. Grover. I brought you a visitor. - Indeed - Yes. This is Miss Leslie Calvin. Mrs. Lamont's niece. What a surprise! What a delightful surprise for your aunt and uncle! - Oh, but I sent them a telegram. - A telegram? I don't recall them mentioning it. Here, let me get your bag. Then they're not expecting me? Forgive me for keeping you standing. Come in, come in. There was no one to meet me at the station. And I tried to telephone but the name wasn't listed. So Dr. Grover brought me out. Oh, how nice. How very nice of you. You must stay for dinner. Emily will be delighted. Emily!? Emily! Did you come a long way Miss Calvin? Yes. From Batavia. Batavia, Emily! Here's Leslie, all the way from Batavia. Leslie! My dear child! Darling we've been so worried about you. If we'd only known when you were coming. - Norbert? Norbert? - But I did send... - Oh, excuse me. Dr. Grover, this is Aunt Emily. - How do you do? How very kind of you to drive her out. Won't you come in and sit down? - Thank you, but I... - Did you get the telegram? No. But don't worry about it, darling. I'm sure it will turn up someday. There you are, Norbert. This is your uncle, dear. - How do you do? - Poor child; nobody met her. You really should have let us know, dear. And Dr. Grover, so kind. How do you do? Hello. I tried to telephone you and you're not in the book. That's odd. Of course, it's not in our name. It's listed under Cleeve because naturally Mr. Cleeve was the only one living here at the time. So you see, dear, you should have looked for Cleeve. But Aunt Emily, you didn't say anything about him in your letter. Two fish! Oh dear, oh dear. I don't know why they do those things. They promise you and then... There's a chicken. I'll just speak with Florella You make me nervous! I'm quite sure Florella can produce something. I told Dr. Grover you'd want him to stay for dinner. - Provided... - We'd love to have you stay, doctor. Of course, a simple meal, under the circumstances. No thanks. I'm afraid I have to get back. Oh. That's too bad. Some other time, then. So glad to have you with us, Leslie. Make yourself at home. - Emily, I'm right in the middle of this. - Yes, I know. You go ahead. I'll be with you in a moment. - I'll show you to you room, dear. - I'll say goodbye now. I'll be out to see you soon. Very soon. - Thank you. - Behave yourself. - Goodbye. - 'Bye. I know you must be tired. Of course, if I'd only known you were coming. I wonder if I could see Mr. Lamont a moment. He seems to have disappeared. He's so engrossed in the book he's writing. He's hardly aware of what's going on around him. In that case, maybe I better tell you what's on my mind. I don't want to alarm you but Leslie's been through a terrible time. I know. The doctor at the hospital wrote us all about it. I just want to explain that she's in a very nervous, unsettled condition. Exhausted. Physically and emotionally. She has nightmares. She's afraid she's turning into a mental case. That's ridiculous, of course. But she shouldn't sit around and brood about it. We know. We'll do everything we can to help her. Just tell Mr. and Mrs. Lamont not to question her too much. Try to make her forget. They would anyway, I'm sure. But I thought I'd better mention it. Very kind of you, doctor, thank you. We'll do everything we can for her. - Goodbye, Mr. Sydney. - Goodbye, Doctor. Heavens! It's stuffy This room hasn't been used since... Darling, you shouldn't have carried your bag up. Norbert would. But he's so absent-minded. All wrapped up in his work. Scientifics A book he's doing for the government. I help him with the typing but really I don't understand a word. Sit down and rest and let... No, no no, I want to help you unpack. My only niece arrives and this is the reception she gets. No one to meet her at the station. And now this room that needs dusting and sweeping so badly. That Florella. Aunt Emily, really I don't mind. - And you mustn't... - And no flowers. Oh well, tomorrow is another day. Perhaps we'll do better tomorrow. I don't want to be any trouble to you. Imagine you being any trouble. You don't know what this means to me. In the hospital I thought I was all alone. Now I have a home and Uncle Norbert and you. My own people who love me. I've never had any children of my own. That's why your coming means so much to me. I hope you'll be happy here, Leslie. I know I will. Sit down, darling. I have to see about dinner. Mr. Sydney is s so particular, he's so awfully particular. And there's no salmon. You'll hear a gong just before dinner, dear I thought perhaps you might like to have this. It was painted of your mother just before she was married. Lovely, isn't it? Yes, lovely. We weren't much alike. She's so pretty, isn't she? Christine always was the pretty one but I didn't mind. I think you're pretty, Aunt Emily. You'll hear a gong for dinner, dear. I'll try to be back before. Florella! Look at this dust and look at these flowers. The room is a pigsty! Sorry, sir. I'll get a dust cloth. Do. Look at that basket. You know I don't like that sort of thing. It's disgusting. ARRIVING BELLEVILE 2:45 WEDNESDAY WITH LOVE, LESLIE CALVIN Oh, there's a good girl. Ah, there you are. This is Mr. Cleeve, Leslie. He runs the plantation for us. How do you do, Miss Calvin? How do you do? This is Florella. How do you do? I hope you'll forgive our (?????????????????) We're just camping out down here. All of our things are still up in New York, you know. It's a pity how some of these houses are let go. Mirrors need resilvering. Draperies needs cleaning. Look at this chair. Crying for attention. Yes, of course. I'll have Florella put some furniture polish on it. Furniture polish. Emily, have they any conception of what this beautiful wood really needs? Why, you're quite right. It needs refinishing. I'll have it done right away. Aunt Emily, have you decided whether to stay here or not? Oh, uh... No, dear, we haven't. You see, your uncle and I have been discussing. - But there are so many problems. - Emily, Would you pass the salt, please? Oh, yes, yes. Why don't you sell Rosignol, Uncle Norbert? What? I only meant that sugar is so scarce... You'd probably get a good price for it. Of course he would. That's what I've been telling him. Besides the price of sugar won't be so high after the war when we can import again. Antiques, business, sugar He knows all about everything. Who's that talking in the kitchen, Emily? Ring the bell. When did you arrive in America, Miss Calvin? Florella? Who's that in the kitchen? It's just Pearson. He just came to help me with the dishes. Pearson's not allowed here anymore. No company during working hours, Florella. Yes, sir. Florella must learn. Pearson must learn too. Florella is such a... I mean... She's very young. You understand. - I suppose you've had... - Perhaps, Emily There may not be any servant problems in the East Indies. When did you leave Batavia? Over a year ago. A year? Why, where have you been? In any bombings? Yes. Did you get away ahead of the japs? Yes. Nip and tuck, huh? How did you manage it? On a trading boat. Darling, you're not eating a bit. I think you should have a hot biscuit. Would you tell us more about it, Miss Calvin? We're so removed from the scene of action in this peaceful backwater. We went to Diego Suarez in Madagascar. - And I had fever. - Poor child. Leslie dear, you've no butter. I don't want any, thank you, Aunt Emily. Go on. What happened? It was Vichy French. They wouldn't give us a visa. And we ran out of our money and we cabled to America. And it took a long time to come. Exasperating delays in war time. I guess you took passage to New Orleans from there. Yes. And then the boat sank. Dear, we should have realized. Do you want me to come with you, Leslie? Leslie, wait! You mustn't... Jittery, isn't she? Very trying on nerves. Very. Fried chicken again. Oh, good morning - Good morning. - Good morning, Miss Leslie. - Hope you rested well, my dear. - Yes, thank you. After a good night's sleep, one feels like a different person. Sorry about the little unpleasantness last evening. Poor Emily was so upset. - If we'd only realized. - Please don't apologize, Mr. Sydney. It was very silly of me. Let's not talk about it anymore, shall we? Of course not. How would you like to go for a stroll? Perhaps we can show you some of the plantation. Are you sure you've nothing more important to do? Certainly not. If Mr. Sydney's too busy, I'd be delighted. I believe you're trying to deprive me of the pleasure of Miss Calvin's company That's very kind of both of you. It's our pleasure, my dear. There's the old sugar house over there. They made their own sugar right here on the place in the old days. The bayou was part of the river. Shallow enough to wade in some places. Very deep in others. Quite dangerous. Only last year a woman went under the quicksand. We heard her holler but by the time we got there, she was gone. She had been carrying a wash basket. And there it was; right where she went down. Marking the spot. It's dangerous ground altogether unless you know it very well. You shouldn't go off alone for the first few weeks. Cleeve or I will join you. That's right. You can't be too careful. Must be awful - drowning in quicksand. Much worse than water. Water's cleaner at least and faster. William, please. Think of Leslie. It's alright. Please don't worry about me. You're a brave girl But I know what Cleeve's words are reminding you of. How about a ride in the boat? Mr. Sydney? Here I am. New Orleans wants you on the telephone. I'm coming. Now that we've finally got rid of that walking phonograph, I'll show you around. Oh, no thank you. But you haven't seen the place and I'm a much better guide than Mr. Sydney. I'd rather not. I know. Tumble down buildings bore me too. But then we're both still young enough to have other interests, aren't we? For instance? I thought we could have some fun, laughs together How would you like to go to town some night and see a picture show? That would be very nice some night. I'll show you around the bayou. Come on. Get in the boat. No thank you. I'd rather not. I don't like boats. Oh yes you do. That's the only way to really see the place. We have birds and flowers out there that you've never even seen. I'd rather not. You can't go on being a coward. She's not a coward. - Oh, hello George. - Hello, Leslie You see, she's following my orders. I told her to stay away from boats for a while. Your orders? Just who are you? He's my doctor. Dr. Grover, this is Mr. Cleeve. - Oh. how do you do? - How do you do? I didn't know you'd given her orders to stay ashore. I just thought a boat ride might be good for her. I'm sure it would. Later on. Look, I've got a few calls to make in my car. - Want to come along? - I'd love to. That's alright with you, Cleeve, isn't it? Sure. Let's go, Leslie. I'll admit the bayou country has it's drawbacks. Too many mosquitoes. Not enough ice skating. The scenary's improving. Take it easy. Just a pig in the road. I almost hit him. It's all your fault too. My fault? I used to be able to keep my eyes on the road when I was driving alone. You hear that? Those are Boudreauxs. What kind of animals are those? You'll see. Bon jour! Mama Boudreaux, this is Leslie Calvin. How do you do? How do you do, mademoiselle? Very very pleased. And this is Jeanette. FRENCH NAME, Cecille, and FRENCH NAME and FRENCH NAME And Yvette. - Bon jour. - Bon jour. Oh, what a big girl! She's a little shy at first. But when she gets to know you, she'll talk your ear off. - Like all my women. - Papa! Yvette, put your dirty hands down. Hey wait a minute. They're all here. Yes, doctor, we are all here. Well, where's the patient? What patient? Someone told me a Boudreaux had fallen out of a tree. That's me. But you weren't hurt. It wasn't a very high tree. It knocked out his wind. I knocked out myself. Well, let's have a look. Is he hurt, doctor? I'm afraid I'll have to prescribe something for him. What is this? An epidemic? Merci. Me too! You will stay for lunch, huh? I still have a couple of calls to make. Oh, sure they will stay. ??????????????? - Doctor, we have shrimp. - Shrimp I caught this morning. Shrimp a la Mama Boudreaux? Shrimp that I like. You never tasted shrimp the way Mama Boudreaux fixes them. I've been fixing them so long I don't know but maybe I can show you. Children, entertain our guests while I fix some shrimp for lunch. How do you like the bayou, Mademoiselle? - Will you bring her to the fais-do-do? - I'd love to bring her. What is a fais-do-do? Well, it means go to sleep. Everyone gets together to dance. And there's music. And fiddles. It's no good. What isn't? I think the fais-do-do is no good ?????????? Children, come and wash your hands and face. Lunch is ready. Quick. Well, now you know what a Boudreaux is. How do you like them? I love them. All of them. I'd like to steal Yvette. Mama Boudreaux's the one to kidnap. She's a great cook Even in a country that considers cooking more important than... Well, than politics. Do they take it that seriously? Do they? The bayou boys don't propose to the pretty girls. They marry the good cooks. I guess I'll be an old maid. All I can do is boil an egg. Wait a minute. I like boiled eggs. Where are your manners? Madame, Messieur. I had fun. I'm sorry it's over. It needn't be. We could have dinner. Good evening, Leslie. Hello, doctor. You've arrived just in time. Dinner's on the table. Oh, I hope I'm not late. Not late. We're having it early. We're all going to the movies. Oh. Well, goodbye. I'll see you tomorrow night. 8 o'clock. 8 o'clock. Good night, doctor. Very nice chap. Did you have a good time? - Wonderful. - Fine. Shall I open it for you? I'm sorry Norbert had to work this evening. Emily's terribly disappointed. These confiscated films made by enemy cameramen and taken from a captured german submarine in the North Atlantic show the ruthless submarine warfare as carried on by our enemies on the high seas. They are their own record of wanton and indecriminate slaugther. The submarine cruises over the north atlantic seeking victims day and night. Suddenly a ship is sighted. The alarm is given. The men run to their battle stations. Slowly the submarine maneuvers into position for the kill. Perhaps it is an unarmed merchantman. Perhaps due to some breakdown it has had to drop out of the convoy. Maybe it carries refugees. Helpless men, women and children rescued from tyranny and oppression and now at last on their way to peace and a new life. The submarine reaches the chosen position. Orders are shouted. And without warning a torpedo is fired. To make sure of the kill, a second torpedo. Death streaks through the waves. Care for another candy? With a crash, the ship is broken and bursts into flames. There is no chance to launch the lifeboats. Helpless victims leap into the water clutching onto anything that can help them to keep afloat. The boat burns fiercely and then - it's back is broken... - Cleeve! You should have found out what was showing. How would I know this would upset her so much? I'm sorry, my dear. I'll take you home right away. Aunt Emily! Aunt Emily! Aunt Emily! Leslie? Well, what is it? In the dark. the lamp. The lamp went out? But it's on. see? I heard a noise. Then it went out and came on again by itself. But it couldn't. I mean... It never has. I suppose not. But I heard a noise. It's the screen door. Yes, it's not fastened. That ought to fix it. It won't do it again. You musn't be frightened, dear. Shall I turn the lamp out for you? No. no thanks, Aunt Emily. I'm alright. Good. Be sure and call me if you need anything. I'm right here. Good night, dear. Try and get some sleep. Don't be frightened. I'll leave the door open. What was it, Emily? She thought the lights went out. - That's strange. - That poor child. Excuse me, mum. - Are you Miss Leslie? - Who are you? I'm Pearson Jackson, Miss Leslie. And I'd like to talk with you. Oh, Pearson Jackson. You frightened me. What is it you want to talk to me about? Florella told me you were nice and kind, Miss Leslie. She said if I told you and you knew that I had been treated wrong, that you'd most likely help me to find out. I've worked here twelve years. Twelve years. Just three or four days after your aunt and uncle came down here from New York, Mr. Cleeve ups and gives me my pay and told me to go. Without any reason? Yes, ma'am. No reason at all, Miss Leslie. And that's what I'd like to find out about. Because I belong here. A man gets a pride for a place after twelve years. I think I understand how you feel, Pearson. And I'm sure Aunt Emily will if you just tell her. But that's what I can't get a chance to do, Miss Leslie. The day that I was let go I asked to speak to Mr. and Mrs. Lamont and Mr. Cleeve told me they were feeling poorly. He told me to go and stay gone. And I came back three or four times to see Mr. Cleeve. And he ran me off. Ran me off. Pearson jackson off Rosignol. I'll try to find out, Pearson. I'll talk to Aunt Emily for you. Thank you, Miss Leslie. And I'll be much obliged. But don't you run yourself no risk of getting yourself into trouble just for me. It won't be any trouble, Pearson. I hope not, Miss Leslie. Things around here have changed. This place ain't like it used to be. Why, I remember... That's Mr. Cleeve's car. Good day, Miss Leslie. I came up to see how you were. Feeling better? Emily's busy with Norbert so I came to see what you want for dinner. I don't care about eating dinner. I was afraid you wouldn't want to go down so I brought you an egg and sherry. Did you get any sleep at all? Maybe after a little egg and sherry you'll try again. You must not get discouraged. You're really making progress, you know. After the shock such as you've had, one doesn't recover all at once. Don't you give up You had a little setback last night but you're not a bit worse. Your uncle mentioned getting a psychiatrist but that isn't necessary. You just get all the sleep you can and have patience. Oh, Miss Leslie They all started without you. I brought something upstairs. Did staying in bed cure your headache? Better thank you, Florella. I'll have this in the kitchen. I'd rather anyway Yes, ma'am. Ain't you relish your dinner, Miss Leslie? Oh, I'm just not hungry, Florella. I don't even think I'll go to the fais-do-do. Fais-do-do? Oh, but Miss Leslie, you better go. It'll help to raise your spirits. I'm afraid it will take a lot more than that. Have you had your dinner, Dr. Grover? Yes, thanks. Well, a cup of coffee. Maybe a glass of iced tea. Emily, maybe Dr. Grover would like something a little more stimulating. Thank you, really, I don't want anything. I just came to take Leslie to the fais-do-do. Hello, Leslie. Are you ready for the festivity? - I don't know, George. - I really don't think you should. You haven't been at all well. Exactly. Leslie's been under the weather Been in bed all day. What's the matter? Don't you feel well? I don't feel ill, George but... Don't you think it might do you some good? I promise not to keep her out too late, Mrs. Lamont. Dr. Grover, she hasn't had a bit of rest all last night. This is really out of the question, doctor. Let's hear what Leslie has to say. Would you like to go? I think I would. This is most ill advised. - After all - I'll prescribe for Leslie. We won't be late, Aunt Emily. I'll go up and change. I'll be down in a moment. I'm sorry if I sounded abrupt. But as I told you, she needs to be cheered up. - Here's our ticket. - Good evening, doctor What did you say? I said I was going to have a good time. Of course you are. Pardon, Ms. Doctor. - Having fun? - Having a wonderful time. Yvette, (other child's name????) Yvette, (?????) Come on! Come out! You bad little things. I've been looking for you all night. - May I have the next dance? - Oh, Papa - Thank you. - She doesn't want to dance with you all night. This is wonderful. How often do they have these affairs? Every couple of weeks or so. Here's to the next one? Here's to the next one. And the one after that. You certainly took to square dancing as if you've lived here all your life. Thank you. Mama Boudreaux said you must have been born dancing. Oh no. Not until I was three. I used to dance for my mother. She taught you? No. Mother never danced. She was an invalid. She never walked from the time she was a child. My father always carried her. She used to say that my feet would have to do all the dancing for the two of us. She couldn't have made a better choice. Don't touch that. Why not? If you touch that, the door opens. If the door opens, you might get out. If you get out, I wouldn't be able to... Leslie Being a country doctor's wife isn't much of a life for a woman. But if she would overlook the bad part. - George - I'd try awfully hard to make it worth the trouble. Darling, I love you. You mustn't say that. But Leslie, I'm asking you to marry me. Leslie, what's wrong? I can't tell you. I can't ever tell you. I mustn't see you alone. I mustn't ever see you again. Leslie Did you have a good time? I had a wonderful time. Why, Leslie, you're crying. Oh, dear. We shouldn't have let you go. You're all tired out. I'll only blame myself. Blame me. Don't talk like that. What happened to upset you? Tell me. He asked me to marry him. Dr. Grover? And you don't want to? But I do. I do. Why? I don't understand. I can't ever marry him or anyone else. But why? If you knew you were going out of your mind. You musn't say or think such things. You're much better. But I'm not. I'm not. All the time I see and hear things that aren't there. Last night I heard the radio and it wasn't even connected. People in their right minds don't have hallucinations. Poor child. Did you tell Dr. Grover about this? No, I'm never going to see him again. Why did they pull me out of the water? That's where I belong. Under the water with Mother and Father. Leslie Leslie Leslie Aunt Emily Did you call? Did you call? Why, no, dear. That's funny. I thought I heard you. I'm sorry. - Good night, dear. - Good night. Leslie Leslie Leslie Leslie Calvin Leslie Pearson. It's you. Miss Leslie, did you hear your name being called? What? what did you say? Yes, ma'am. What do you mean? Did you hear voices calling my name? Yes, ma'am. I sure did. You heard them. You heard them. Then they're really there. Yes, Miss Leslie. They say this place is haunted. But you shouldn't be rambling around in the dark like this, Miss Leslie. Well, what are you doing here? I gotta find out. And when I do, I'll let you know. I'll let you know tomorrow maybe. I'll go up to the house and then I'll know. There's one thing I do know, Miss Leslie They're after you because they're calling your name. And you better get back into the house right this minute. Alright, Pearson. I'll go but... That's the path there, Miss Leslie. I'll watch you from here until you're safe back in the house. Leslie Hello. Dr. George Grover, please. I don't know the telephone number. Hello, George? Oh, I'm sorry. Would you please give him a message? Would you ask him to call Leslie Calvin? It's very important. Thank you. Leslie, dear, come in. What are you doing up at this hour? It's dreadfully late. I want to talk to you, Aunt Emily. Lonely are you, poor darling? Did anything special happen tonight to upset you? Aunt Emily, Tell me about Mr. Sydney. What do you want to know about him? - How long have you known him? - Oh a very long time. He and your uncle have been friends since school days. He was best man at our wedding. Does he have much to do with Uncle Norbert's affairs? Oh yes. He handles everything. He's so practical in money matters. Norbert hasn't a practical bone in his body. And you completely trust Mr. Sydney? Why, yes, darling. I'm astonished you should ask. What made you? What about Mr. Cleeve? What is it, dear? How much do you know about Mr. Cleeve? Only that he's a very good overseer. Mr. Sydney says he's done wonders with the plantation. He's prudent, see? It's got to be them. or one of them. What has to be who, dear? Aunt Emily, I told you I thought I heard voices calling me. I thought they weren't real voices. They were I wasn't having hallucinations. Somebody else heard them too. Pearson heard them. But he couldn't have. Or if he did, he was just imagining. That would be silly too, wouldn't it? I don't believe in ghosts, do you? It was somebody who was trying to make me think I was losing my mind. But why? For what earthly reason? I don't know. I can't imagine that anyone out of sheer meanness would. It's not Mr. Sydney. That's out of the question. I'll tell Norbert. He'll get to the bottom of it. Aunt Emily, you don't know how relieved I am. About the voices, I mean. Well, of course, dear. I thought I'd never dare fall in love, ever. He seems a very nice young man. When he asked me to marry him I said no because I thought... Well, don't fret, darling. He'll ask you again, I'm sure. You'll be married. Your mother's wedding veil is in the attic. I think we'll look tomorrow. She was lovely. Her happiness made her radiant. No one wept at that wedding. Your grandmother said, "I'm not losing a daughter I'm gaining a son." Aunt Emily, You and Mother were very close, weren't you? We were inseperable from childhood. Tell me about the things you used to do together. Oh, we did all of the usual things that little girls do. We played with dolls. Mother said that grandfather used to be very strict with you. He was. Even for those days. But we managed to have a little fun as we were growing. He used to tell me about all the beauxs you used to have. - And all the parties that you used to - Oh, but she was the popular one. She never missed a dance. Her dance program was always filled first. In those days we had a pencil with a tassle on it. - Did mother like to dance? - Oh, she adored it. Of course, we didn't do the modern dances. We waltzed and two-stepped and polka. Was she a good dancer? If I didn't love her so much, I'd be jealous. Maybe I was. But just a might jealous anyway. She was as light as a feather; the best of all the girls. There's Norbert with the tea. We drink a cup of tea before retiring. Oh, Leslie, forgive me. Come, darling. Have a cup of tea with us. It'll make you sleep. Norbert makes much better tea than I do. Because I always warm the pot before I put in the leaves. I hope you like it a little strong. A spoon for each cup and one for the pot. That's the way your grandmother used to make it. You want milk? Yes, please. Norbert, Leslie's told me the most extraordinary thing. She wants your advice. - Yes? - Will you give her a cookie, please? - Oh, yes No, thank you. Oh, but they're whole wheat. Norbert, Leslie thinks that Cleeve and Sydney... Did you get your milk? No. But Leslie thinks... Drink your tea, darling. He isn't there yet? No ma'am. He's out on call. I don't know where. And he didn't say when he'd be back. Would you please tell him that Leslie Calvin called? Yes, thank you. You're sure anxious to get hold of that guy. I wish some girl would call me up three times. Do you? Leslie Here's your medicine. Did you forget it? I thought you might have so I brought it down to you. Or would you rather take it upstairs? Pearson? Yes, Miss Leslie. Keep out of sight. Keep out of sight. Sydney's watching me. You're in danger, Miss Leslie. I saw them this morning. Careful. He's looking at us. They're not your real aunt and uncle. They're trying to fool you. I know. Go away, Pearson. He's coming towards us. I'll stay by here if you want me to. No, no. Not now. I'm not afraid, Miss Leslie. Meet me tonight at the bayou. Go, Pearson. hide! Hi Taking a walk? Hot, isn't it? Times like this were made for sleeping anyway. You might've got hurt walking around the woods alone. When is your doctor friend coming around again? You go for him, don't you? You know, you and I could have a lot of fun together. If you'd just be yourself for a minute. Is that you, Leslie? - I was thirsty. I thought I'd go down.. - I've water here But I know I've disturbed you. - Come in, Leslie. - Yes, come in. It's too hot to sleep. Think I'll have a cigarette. - Didn't I bring up my cigarettes? - Here you are, dear. Yes, I think so. Here on the table. Oh yes. here they are. Can't sleep? Good night. Good night. Good morning, Miss Leslie. Good morning. Leslie, sit down. I'll get your breakfast. I'll tell Florella. She didn't come this morning. She simply didn't come. You can't depend on her. Emily? Good morning. Good morning. What have you done with the chicken livers? Dear, I only cooked them and you simply... Sit down. I'll get my breakfast. Oh no, no. You stay right here. I'll get you something right away. People who cook like Emily should stick to simple things. Look at these chicken livers. Ruined beyond repair. George? Oh George, I've been trying to get you. When are you coming out? Correct me if I'm wrong but I remember you said you didn't want to see me again A girl can change her mind, can't she? Yeah, I suppose so. Look, Leslie, I've been up all night on a case. And I'm still kind of tied up but I'll catch up on my sleep this afternoon and drop by this evening. Good. Then I'll expect you at one. Leslie, what is this? You say in an hour? - I'll be waiting for you. - Well, I don't get it. If it's got you doing double-talk, I'll come out as soon as I can. Thank you. Goodbye. Here's you coffee, Leslie. Was that George, dear? Yes. That's a nice young man. Is he coming to see you? Yes. In a little while. I'm going to the field office. Anything else you want me to get done? No, that's all. Your young doctor has been quite attentive. There's not much competition around. I don't think the doctor would see anyone else if there were. I think you're partial, Aunt Emily. Leslie, I believe you're blushing. Well, I shall take my constitutional. I'll leave you the porch free of inconvenient dullards. You shouldn't walk so much when you're sick. I'm always telling him but he won't listen. I'll leave you too, dear. I'm going up to my room to lie down. I wish your uncle would stop this typing and take a rest. Good afternoon, George. Good afternoon, Mrs. Lamont. Hello, Leslie. Hello, George. I... I know you children will excuse me. And perhaps some lemonade will cool you off Leslie, what's the matter? Oh, George, thank God you've come. I thought I was going mad, really mad. I wasn't before. Mad, I mean. I did hear voices. They weren't just in my mind. Pearson heard them too. He did. - They killed him. - Now wait a minute, Leslie. Let me get this straight. I found him down by the bayou. They killed him. Because he told my real aunt and uncle before they came. They aren't. They're impostors. They wanted me to think I heard things. They made the lights go on and off. Oh, George! George, thank God you've come! Darling, what are you talking about? This is why I said I couldn't marry you. It was because I thought I was losing my mind. But I'm not really. It was something they were doing. Darling, you're much too excited. Try to be calm. George, I'm a prisoner. They stood guard so I didn't dare. You must take me away right now. I will. I will take you away, darling, but... But what? Leslie, please listen to me. What you need most is a few hours sleep. George, you don't know what you're saying. I'm in terrible danger. If we don't hide they'll kill me like they killed Pearson You don't believe me. You think I'm imagining. Imagination is a very powerful force. We can all see and hear things that aren't really there. And it doesn't mean that anything's wrong with the mind. It's nerves with you, darling. I'll be back some time tomorrow afternoon. Tomorrow will be too late. I want you to take this prescription. The directions are here. And please, go to bed. Will you, darling? George, please. Darling, please do as I say. Oh, hello Mr. Sydney I was looking for Mr. Lamont. He's very busy, Dr. Grover, finishing up his report. But I'm at your service if there's anything I can do. I'm worried about Leslie. Very worried. She's been telling me some very fantastic things. She seems to think she's a prisoner here. I'm afraid she's getting a persecution complex. She talks about murders, impostors. Sounds pretty wild. Good gracious, she's getting worse. That's not all. She told me Mr. and Mrs. Lamont BELIEVE YOU S. LISTENING INSIDE. TOO DANGEROUS TO GO NOW... STAY IN YOUR ROOM... BE BACK WITH HELP RIGHT AWAY. I LOVE YOU You really think it's very serious, Dr. Grover? Yes, as a matter of fact, she mustn't stay here any longer. No telling what she might do to herself in her condition. The best thing we can do is get hold of a good psychiatrist. Yeah. I'll take care of that. Why don't you let me do that? I know a good man in new orleans. I'll make all the arrangements and come back for her as soon as I can. Can you spare the time? Yes of course I can. I want to do everything possible for Leslie. Then I suppose the only thing we can do is wait. Yes, I've given her some pills. Maybe she can rest. Better not disturb her for a while. Oh, we'll do everything we can. I'm sure you will. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, doctor. oh ah... By the way, doctor, could you drop me off at the field office? Sure. I'd be glad to. Hop in. Thanks. Sydney I'm getting tired of playing Uncle Norbert. Of talking and eating with my chin stuck out. I think I've stuck my chin out a little too far as it is. I'm not making any bones about it. I'm mighty worried. That young doctor may be here any minute. He said he'd be back in two days. He might change his mind. I think that's none of our business. But it does affect Pinky and me. What I'd like to know is What do you have in your mind to do? Get the girl, May. You're not going to harm her, are you? If anything bad, I mean really bad should happen to Leslie, I don't know what I'd do. I've grown terribly fond of her. I don't want her hurt. I'm afraid all sentimental considerations must be put aside for the time being. We uh... We didn't bargain for anything like murder, Sydney. If either of you have anything constructive to propose - We refuse to have any part of it. - We didn't bargain for anything like this. So you might just as well count us out. And as far as our share of the proceeds are concerned, well, you can keep it. Not that we haven't earned it. We've done everything we've agreed to and more. As far as the money is concerned. -I'll tell you the truth. We need it. We need it badly. - I'll pack our things, Pinky. - Sit down, May. - I won't sit down. We're getting out of here as soon as we can. Stop her, Pinky. - Wait a minute, May. - I won't wait for anything. I'm your husband and you're going to do as I say. Let's try to be reasonable for a moment. Nothing you can say will make me change my mind. My mind is made up. Oh, shut your mouth, May. Don't you be rude to me. My instinct is to clear out too. I'm just as anxious to be rid of this whole thing as you are. It's messy and I don't like messes. Unfortunately we can't pick and choose. Now suppose we were to pull up our traces and light out. How far do you think we'd get? The state line? Would you stop using "we" as though Pinky and I had any part of it? You're in this up to your necks. Whether you like it or not. When we accepted your offer to come up here and be the Lamonts Surely you've guessed by now what happened to the Lamonts? Less said the better about such things but a fact is a fact. You mean they're dead? Did you uh... please. You should have told us when you made us the offer. - It wasn't fair not to tell us. - Of course it wasn't. may's right. That was done before we got here. We had nothing to do with it. True. But I think you'd find it very difficult to make a jury believe that. Bring the girl down, May. Pretty little romance she's having with that doctor, isn't it? Well, There's no use dwelling on the unpleasant side of things. What are we gonig to tell the doctor? You should thank your stars, Pinky, one member of this concern has a little foresight. You awake? No more tricks. You behave yourself unless you like being hit over the head. Are the mosquitoes bothering you? Well, it won't be long now. You mean I won't have to worry about scratching the bites. Want a drink? Yeah. Coke? Yeah. Rum? Sure. Now take me. If I was in your fix I'd want to get cockeyed too. Thanks. Ok, sport. How long have I been out? Oh, two or three hours. The first time. Oh, now look. You ain't going to cause any more fuss, I hope. Because if you do, you're just going to get slugged again. As per Mr. Sydney's instructions. You do everything Sydney says? I have a mind of my own. What happened to Leslie? I reckon I can guess. But I won't. The same that happened to the real Lamonts? Maybe. They're out in the bayou under the water hyacinths. How'd you know? I didn't. That's right, sport That's where they are. Out in the bayou alright. Why are you afraid of Sydney? Who me? afraid? I ain't afraid of nobody. You notice you do all the dirty work, don't you? What dirty work? I can't see Sydney pulling a trigger or sticking a knife. With you to do it for him, why should he spoil his lily white hands? George. George, darling. Leslie, don't worry. You're hurt. Start the boat up. He came to and started raising a fuss so I banged him over the head again. Cleeve, you've been drinking. Says you. You got no right to do that, Mr. Sydney. No impudence from you. Look I don't like being ordered around like dirt under somebody's feet. Be polite. Ask please to do something. Maybe I will maybe I won't. But I don't like being ordered around. Do you? Two different boys. Cleeve drunk. Cleeve sober. Tell me, Sydney, what's so important that it's worth the lives of five people? Leslie Leslie Calvin Home recorded. We set it for a certain time. And the lamp? That was you too? Cleeve. I know nothing about electricity Simple devices. Too bad they failed to serve their purpose. Too bad I mean, doctor, for Leslie. You see, we've done everything we could for Leslie. But you didn't answer my question. What in your mind is worth the lives of five people? Why, money, doctor. What else? Hurry, Cleeve. I've only got two hands. How much money will these particular murders bring? Three hundred thousand dollars minus agents fees, of course. We could get a good deal more with plantations skyrocketing in value. But considering we have no time to dicker, it's a fairish price. It must have been an awful nuisance arriving when I did, by the way. George is pretty well known around here. What are you going to say when people come asking after him? We'll tell them you eloped. They'd believe it long enough for us to finish our business and be off. What do you mean "us"? You aren't telling me, are you that you intend to cut Aunty and Uncle and Cleeve in? I beg your pardon? You will have committed five murders for money. Well, why not eight for more money? Take Cleeve, now. What's going to keep you from disposing of Cleeve after you've disposed of us? That would only be good business according to your likes. Then after Cleeve comes aunty's turn. Then uncle. Boat's ready. Good boy, Cleeve Untie him. Don't turn your back on him. Keep your gun off safety. Shut up, you. I'm only telling you for your own good. I don't want any more blood on this floor. I've told you about blood stains. They're a giveaway. Untie him. Come. Get up and no tricks. Alright come on. Let's get going. I'm so afraid. I know. Alright, Cleeve. This place is as good as any. I won't do it. What's that? - I won't do it unless. - Unless what? I'm not taking any chances on you pulling a fast one, Sydney. - A fast one? - You know what I mean. My dear boy, you're not going to take what this fellow says seriously. There's only going to be one gun in this boat, Sydney. Mine. - That's telling him, Cleeve. - Shut up, you. Put your revolver over the side and let go of it. Dr. Grover, you've poisoned this boy's mind. I'm tempted to do this job on you myself. Are you going to do like I say, Sydney? Leslie, get out of this boat! Jump! - Give it to me. - You idiot. We've got to move. They know where we went in. You're so good, go on, hit something. Shut up. Don't move, darling. Keep still. Start the boat. Are you hurt, badly? Bring the flashlight. Come out of there! Come out of there! I'll find them. Where are you? You might as well show yourselves. You haven't got a chance. I'll find you. Come out of there. Come out of there. Come out of there. Come out of there. I'll find them. Where are you? You haven't got a chance. Where are you? Hey, I'm stuck! Give me a hand, will you? Sydney! The quicksand! Don't struggle. You can get out by yourself. Don't shoot them, Mr. Sydney! Help me! Help me! I can't get out! Help me, Mr. Sydney! Mr. Sydney, help me! Help, Mr. Sydney! Sydney, please! I'm stuck! Please! I can't get out, Mr. Sydney! Please! Throw the gun over here, Sydney. And I'll come and get him out. Don't shoot! Please help me! Help me! You'll get them later! Well, that does it, Sydney. Now you've lost your guide. You'll never get out of here unless I lead you. Go ahead. Try to get out if you don't believe me Not that way. That looks like solid ground but it isn't. One step that way and you'll go down just as Cleeve did. No use looking, Sydney. Start walking and take your chances. But remember, you only get one wrong guess because I won't pull you out. Come on. Make up your mind. What are you going to do? You better throw me that gun. You've only got one bullet left and if you shoot me you'll stay here forever You're wise. It's hard on the nerves in the swamp at night. In fact it would have been quite safe for you to walk back to the boat. There isn't any quicksand here. Only back there. But of course you couldn't tell that. This way. Go on. Get in. I guess you better take the wheel, darling. Sit down, Sydney. The starter button's on the dash. Go ahead, darling. There's nothing to be afraid of now. Are you alright? Yes, I'm alright. I'm alright.
