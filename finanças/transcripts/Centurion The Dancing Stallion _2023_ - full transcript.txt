- What time does he get here? - I don't know. Send me a photo. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning, sunshine. So, uh, I have great news for you. - Hm? - Jorge just called about a white Andalusian stallion. He's been kicked around a bit but comes from a great bloodline. So I put in a silent bid. - And guess what? - Hm? - We won. - Really? - Mm-hm. - Have you seen him? Not yet. My accountant reminds me I used to have money in cows. Now I got horses. And us! I love when you do that together. Daddy, you know that I need a quality horse so I can compete with the best. Mmm. Persuasive argument, counselor. Jeff, honey, be careful. She'll be working in your firm soon. Quit badgering the witness. See that? Now I got badgers. - That's... - Dad joke. I know. Love you. Adios. - Love you, too. - Love you. Charlie? What? Careful when you load the horse. I always am. Anything else? Yeah. Come straight back here. No stopping. Why am I gonna stop, huh? Not on your time, boss. Call me when the horse is in the trailer. Yeah. Whatever. Keep his head up. That's it. Use your legs to turn him. Remember, ten points for a clean rotation. 'Bout that time. I'm pulling in. Hey, boss. I just loaded up the horse. I am headed back. Mm-hm. Right. No. See you then. See you later. Hey, what are y'all doing, huh? - Excited? - Let's see what we got. Yeah, let's see. - You do? - Mm-hm. Charlie? What's this? What? Where's the horse? I don't know. He was there. We loaded him up. You reek of booze. I only stopped for one. Honest. Someone must have took him at the tavern. Or somebody didn't double-check the gate. - I thought I did. - You're done. You're through. Go get your things. Pack up. Come on, George. You're fired. I'll retrace his route. See if I can find the horse. Sorry, honey. It's okay. Yes, Mr. Hall. I'll find him. Believe me. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hey! It's okay. It's okay. Easy, boy. Easy. Centurion, huh? Nice name, buddy. What's going on here? Where's this horse come from? Name's Centurion. Hall Ranch? There's a Hall Ranch three or four miles up the main road. You want me to take him there? Yeah! Go! Just get him out of here. Okay. Come on. Hello? Hello? Whoa. Que paso? Is this your horse? Saw your name on his tag. Thank you for bringing him. Sure. He's real scared. He's been badly mistreated. Yeah. I noticed. Not by us. We don't treat animals like that. He got lost transporting him here. Where'd you find him? He was in a vineyard a few miles down the road. Do you mind bringing him into the stables? No. Come on, boy. I'm Jorge Rodriguez, the ranch manager. They also call me George. Danny Sanchez. Where'd you learn about horses, Danny? I grew up on a ranch in Arizona. My father was the foreman. Yeah, I'll take him from here. Whoa, whoa! Easy. Easy, boy. - It's okay. - I'm not gonna hurt you. - It's okay. - Okay. Huh. Okay. Danny, maybe you should put him in the stall. - Sure. - Number two. Come on, boy. Come on. Thanks. You're welcome. You're owed a reward for finding him. No, that's-- that's okay, sir. Are you sure? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. - Got some nice stalls. - Yeah. We breed and sell Andalusian and Friesian horses. - Spanish and Danish breeding. - Mm-hm. That's impressive. You know your horses. Yeah, it was my father's passion. We also train dancing horses. You know, my father used to dance in competitions. Oh, horses are the heartbeat of our Mexican culture. Well, I... I better get back to work. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Rodriguez. Good to meet you, young man. I'll drive you back. I owe you at least that. I'll take it. You know, I fired the idiot responsible for letting Centurion get loose. And not just for that, he was a general screw-up. That leaves me short a stablehand. Someone to clean the stalls. Exercise the horses. Maintain the manure pile for pickup every Thursday. Know anyone like that? When do I start? I have a trailer in the back of my place I can let you have for cheap. I'll take it. Good. You can start by giving Centurion a good shower. - Braiding his mane. - Sure. - And his tail. - Cool. Appreciate it. - Welcome. - Thank you. I'll get started. Think you brought me good luck, boy. Oh, my God, Mom. Who would do that to a horse? Here. Oh, not yet. He's got spirit. Spirit? You must be the new ranch hand. I'm Ellissia. I'm Danny. Danny, this is Ms. Hall. She runs things around here. - Not really. Welcome to Hall Ranch son. - Hi. He's not too bad, huh? He's amazing. Danny, that's enough for today. Come on. Grab your bag. Welcome to the Rodriguez hacienda. It's nice. This is it right here. My wife, Florencia, just cleaned it. Been fixing it up to travel when my wife and I retire. Electricity, hot water, TV, toilet, shower. This is all mine? It's all yours. This is great. I've never even had my own place before. You're welcome to take your meals with me and my wife... or whatever. If you guys don't mind. I'm not much of a cook. Okay. See you at seven. - Thank you, George. - You're welcome. So we found him. He's not dead. He's not wounded, but he's not in too good of shape. Is that it? Yeah, something like that. Poor thing. How about the horse? What? Your father's talking about Danny. The new stable guy. Oh, he's in great shape. What? Oh, really? You know, there was something in his eyes that I really liked. I'm sorry. Are we talking about the horse or are we talking about Davy? - Danny. - Danny. The horse, silly. Oh, well, that's encouraging. Your turn. Oh... Uno, dos, tres, cuatro. Oh, you're out. This chicken is delicious. Thanks, Danny. I hear you're from Arizona. Do you have family there? I did. Uh, both my parents passed away. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. My father like last year. My mom when I was young. I have some family in Mexico, too, but I don't see them too often. - We have family there, too. - Oh, yeah. Jorge tells me you know a lot about horses. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, my dad, he was, uh, he was a proud vaquero. He always told me that the Mexicans taught the gringos how to ride. And how to cook. - More rice? - Please. - It's really good. - Please. Thank you. Dad! So, that is our prize Andalusian? Mm-hm. Not much is he? Hold your head high. Show them you're somebody. Come on. There you go. Good boy. Good boy. That's it, Ellissia. Slow down the transition. Yeah. That was wonderful. Whoo! So, honey, you think you're ready for Uva Blanka, hm? We'll see. So the top three qualify for the Solano. I mean, imagine that. - It will put this ranch on the map. - Mm. That'll be you one day, boy. Welcome to the Uva Blanka. In the Spanish horse dancing, the rider with the most points for the dancing skills wins. Our first competitor, Julio Sanchez! And remember, stepping off the platform gets you disqualified. ...David Rodriguez, from Dumbo Ranch. That handsome young guy on the black Friesian is Francisco Gomez. He's the next big star. Wait a minute, now. I thought Ellissia was. Yeah. She will be. Trust me. There you go. And now please welcome from American Canyon, Francisco Gomez. And for our final rider of the day, from the Hall Ranch in Napa Valley, we welcome Ellissia Hall. Whoo! Whoo! Hey, how'd I do? Your rhythm was perfect. Amazing. Yeah, thanks, guys. Hey. Thank you to all of our amazing performers at this year's Uva Blanka! The top three ranches qualify for the prestigious Festival Del Caballo Solano finals. This is the most important event of the year. Our third place winner... Ellissia Hall from Hall Ranch, riding Principe. Oh, my God! You made it! In second place... ...David Rodriguez from Dumbo Ranch, riding Coronel. Our first place winner, riding Zapata, Francisco Gomez! Congratulations to all the winners. Take a photo. Cheese. - Did you get it? - Yeah. I think I got it. Cheese. You know, I thought you deserved second, Ellissia. I thought I deserved first. - Congratulations, Francisco. - Thank you. Very nice seeing you again, Mrs. Hall, Mr. Hall. You too. Pleasure. Good to see you, man. Nicely done. How are you, son? Hey. Miguel. Nice to meet you. How exciting. You're both in the Solano now. I can't wait. Ellissia's quite formidable. I'll have to dance my best. It was a great performance. Both of you. Thanks, Danny. That means a lot. Well, uh, we're off to celebrate. Welcome to join us if you like. You know, I'm not feeling too good, but maybe another time. Maybe I can drop by your ranch to say hello. Thursday's good. Excellent. I'll see you then. Very nice seeing you both. Thank you. Fine young man. Ah, you got his trust. Excellent. Maybe we can get him to dance soon. Hey, Francisco. Whoa! Whoa! Easy, easy, easy, Centurion. Calm down. Andalusians can be testy. Yeah. I don't know what's spooking him. I got him. Go show your friends around. Usually, he's a lot calmer. - Easy, boy. Easy. - You know, we just got rid of a white Andalusian like a few months ago. Remember it, Francisco? Dumb as mud but, you know, - I can't remember the name. - It doesn't matter. I'll meet you back at the truck later. So, Ellissia, show me around. Okay, sure. Hall Ranch... This one is Alicia. That girl is so hot. I remember the name of the Andalusian we got rid of. Centurion. Isn't that Ellissia's horse? Don't say a word. I raked that plow horse pretty good. Ellissia won't like that. Okay. It's our secret. It better be. Ellissia? Ellissia, are you okay? Yeah. You're dizzy. What's the matter? What happened? I just-- I'm feeling-- I'm just-- I'm tired. I just-- I don't feel well. Mom, I think maybe I've been, uh, working too hard. Okay, that's enough for today. We'll work tomorrow. Okay, yeah. Something's not right. - We should probably see a doctor. A doctor just because I'm feeling a little bit weak, Mom? Mom, hey, please. No, no, no, don't please me. Okay? Let's get you in the house. Thanks, Jorge. That was delicious, Isabella. I'm glad you liked it. Regardless of what your daughter doesn't eat. What's wrong? Why are you...? I'm just not very hungry. She's been eating like a little bird. You don't know this, but she became so tired that she had to stop training today. - Really? Really? - That's... that's dramatic. Dramatic. Okay, that's it. I'm making an appointment with the doctor. - What? - Yeah. - Dad! - Dad? Mom. Do what your mom says. She's gonna make an appointment with the doctor. Go see the doctor. I'm sure it's fine. - Thank you. - Sure. Uh, now, while we have not been eating for the last three-quarters of the Rams-49ers games, may we please be excused so we can do the wave in the lounge room? - Wave. - Yeah. Mom, don't you wanna do the wave? Yeah, no, no. No waves, okay. Hey. Hey. You feeling better? Yeah, thanks. Mm. Hi, buddy. Hey, big guy. Do you want to go for a ride? - Water? - Thank you. Yeah. Don't stand too close. You might catch what I have. I'll take my chances. I just never had anything that made me feel like this. You think you should maybe take it easy for the day? I can make sure Centurion gets his workout. It's not a big deal. Yeah, if you don't mind. Thank you, Danny. - Hey, help! - Oh, my God. Hey! Someone help! Jorge! Pack more gauze in her mouth. Set up chest X-rays and blood work immediately. Right away. Hi. Is Ellissia all right? - What have you heard? - I'm not sure. Hi. Uh, we're here to see our daughter, Ellissia Hall. She has been admitted to the ER. We've stabilized Ellissia for now. - Why? - Stabilized? What are you talking about? Your daughter is very anemic, and also has low white blood cells and extremely low platelets. I am concerned this is a blood disorder. Disorder? I've called in a blood specialist, Dr. White, who will give us a better idea of what this is. Okay. Where-where-where is she? I'd like to see my daughter. Of course. Of course. Hello, everyone. This is Dr. White, the hematologist. - Doctor. Jeffrey Hall. - Mr. Hall, Mrs. Hall. And you must be Ellissia. Well, um, based on the preliminary blood work, it appears that we are looking at leukemia. Leukemia as in cancer? Well, there are different kinds of leukemia, and that's what we'll be looking at. I know this is a very scary time for you all right now, but there are some immediate procedural things that we can do, and the first thing is a bone marrow biopsy. That'll tell us the type of leukemia that Ellissia has. - So we don't know yet? - No. We'll schedule that. I'll have that scheduled for tomorrow morning. But until then, uh, we're going to be boosting your platelets to help stop the bleeding along with other medicines to help stabilize you. Now, the most important thing is to stay positive. Okay? I'm gonna say that a lot, so you're gonna get tired of that. All right? I'll talk to you a little bit later. - You're welcome. - Thank you so much. What did he say? You'll be okay. Okay. We'll get through this, honey. Okay? Mm-hm? Isabella called. They think it's leukemia. Help! Well, we just got our first lucky break. The biopsy results came back and the type of leukemia that Ellissia has is treatable and curable. Thank you, Jesus. It's called acute promyelocytic leukemia or APL, and for some unknown reason, this leukemia occurs slightly more often in Hispanics. We-we don't understand why. So what's our next move? We need to start Ellissia on chemo treatments as soon as possible. - Chemo? - Yes. The treatment is very aggressive. And you're gonna go through some very, very tough times. It will not be easy. Please wear a mask if you go outside and around other people or animals. We don't want to risk you getting sick with your immune system so compromised. And remember, it's critical that you do not injure yourself. We cannot have you bleeding. Centurion. Hey, honey, your mask. Centurion. Hey, look who's here. Jorge. Honey, doctor's orders. Your mask. I know. He won't recognize me with my mask. - Oh, come on. - Hi. Hi, buddy. - It's nice to see you back. - Thanks. - Put your mask on. - Mom. Right now. Please. - Did you miss me? - Jeffrey, come on. Elli, listen to your mother. It's just for the weekend, Mom. I'm going back on Monday. And Jorge, don't you dare let her get on that horse until she's done with her chemo treatments. You hear me? - Yes, señora. Sí, señora. - Come on! - Am I being clear? - Sí, señora. Honey, I'm going to take a shower. - You need anything? - I'm okay. Hey. My champion's back. I'd hug you but you could die. No one's gonna die. So you figured out that I'm not competing in Solano this year. So? Compete next year. Yeah, but... Just because I can't compete doesn't mean that somebody can't. It's Hall Ranch that qualified. Danny? Centurion knows him and he knows the routines. How about it, Danny? Think you can do the Solano? That's my father. It's not me. Your father is not here. Maybe it's time to step up. What do you have to lose? We start tomorrow, and no fooling around. One of the judges is a top charrería rider from Mexico. Very serious business. Very serious business. Danny is gonna ride in Solano. Really? How did that come about? I asked him. He said he didn't want to but he needs this. But Hall Ranch has a competitor at this year's Solano. Isn't that great? Yeah, yeah, it is. That is, honey. That is great. Morning. Good morning. What are you doing? I need your help. What? I need you to saddle Centurion. Saddle him? I'm going for a ride. You know you're not supposed to be riding. Yeah, I know. Ellissia, don't-- Don't make me do this. Okay. The last time that I was on a horse, I had no idea that it might be the last time. I'm going into the hospital tomorrow, and there are no guarantees that I'm going to come out ever. So, please, help me ride my horse. I could lose my job. Okay. Then don't help me. You gonna wait for me? You're a sweet person, Danny. Ellissia! You know, I forget all my problems when I'm on a horse. It's beautiful here. It's my favorite place in the whole world. Hola, papá. It's my father. Your father? Yeah, he passed... a few months ago. Danny, I'm sorry. I'd like to think he's been reincarnated as an eagle. It must be nice to have somebody watching over you. I'm so scared I'm gonna die that I can hardly breathe. My mother got sick when I was ten. It was really scary. She was the one who gave me this. She had it blessed by her priest to protect me. I want you to have it. I can't take this. Your mom gave it to you. It's yours. Serious. It'll protect you now. Thank you. Well, that's totally unacceptable. What were you thinking? Young lady. Is it-- and you! Please, don't-don't blame Danny. - It's not his fault. - Really? Yeah, I made him do it. Really. - And where's your mask? - I took it off. But, honey, what if you had fallen off that horse? - Come on. We gotta go. We gotta go. - Mom? No. You're fired. Get off the property. You heard the boss. Finish the day, pack your things. We'll score up before... before you leave. George... George, I'm sorry. Hello, boss? I found Centurion on his side. He doesn't look good. I called Dr. Vanessa. All right, uh, let's see what she says. Listen, I want you to get Danny back, okay? Find him and, uh, and as of now, he's rehired. Oh. Good, good. That's-that's great news. Keep me updated on the horse. Let's get this contained. Okay? Yes, sir. What you been up to, boy? Danny... Mr. Hall called. You're rehired. He really said that? Yeah. Yeah. And you can stay. George... this job... the ranch... Ellissia... it's the best thing that's happened to me... in a long time. I already lost one family, I can't lose another. Listen, son, we need you, too. Centurion's not feeling well. He needs our help. There is a major impaction in his intestine. I found larkspur in his-- in his mane. Larkspur flower is toxic. It could have caused it. Now, unless you can get him on his feet and get him walking, he's going to require surgery. I tried. It's too painful for him. I have to run this by Mr. Hall. This is your God box. So if you ever feel afraid, I want you to write down all your fears and put them in here and hand them to God. - Mom? - Yeah? I don't think God is here for me anymore. Yeah. Hey. Look at me. God never left you. Hm? God's right there. Don't forget that you're a child of God. You have nothing to fear, honey. Hm. Never seen this cross before. Danny gave it to me. Danny. That boy. I'm still not over what he did. So irresponsible. Mom... what is that thing that you always tell me about... forgiveness? You are so smart, missy. He's got a good heart. He's been through a lot. I talked to Mr. Hall. No surgery for Centurion. What's wrong? - Hm? - Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing, honey. Mom, I know you. What's wrong? Listen, I don't want you to worry about anything, and I want you to focus and get better, please. Please, okay? Is it Centurion? Is he okay? He got colic. Dr. Vanessa is looking after him so I don't want you to worry about it. Okay? He'll be all right? We don't know yet. But I don't want you to worry about anything, okay? Hey, Doc. Centurion has taken a turn for the worse. Mr. Hall doesn't want to go through with the surgery. I'll see you here. Where is it? Dad. - Hi, sweetie. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, honey. Mm... Uh, Mom told me that Centurion is sick. What? I'm sorry. What'd you say? She told me that Centurion is sick. How's he doing? Angel, he's, um, sick. You can tell me the truth. - I am. He's sick. - How sick? Very, but the, um, the vet said that... that we might-- we might have to euthanize-- - What? - Really? - I said that, too. - You can't do that. No, no. We gotta find something to do, - there's no way-- - Jeffrey, a word outside. - Sure. - Now. - Right. - We'll be right back, honey. Exactly-- that's exactly what I want to do. Really? What are you thinking, huh? Your daughter is in so much pain. - Oh, sweetie, come on. - No, no, no. What are you gonna do about this? Come on, George. Come on. Pick up. Thank you for coming. You're okay to do this, right? Yeah. I'm sorry it has to be this way. Yeah. Me too. Wait! Am I too late? We're just about to administer the euthanizing. Don't do that, 'cause Ellissia needs him. She can't fight without him. There you go, boy. Attaboy. But you need to keep him walking, or he's still gonna need surgery. All right. Oh, we'll keep him walking, all right. If it takes all night. Mr. Hall? I'm good. I'm good, Jorge. Have a seat. Thanks, man. He says he's good. You're good. You must be exhausted after spending all night with Centurion. I'm all right. Life is precious. The way I figure, we're all here for a reason. Sometimes destiny can surprise us all. What-- What is it? What is it? What is it? Honey, what is it? Nurse?! Honey, what is it? Nurse! Nurse! Someone, please help! Hey, George. George! - Mrs. Hall... - Dr. White. The CAT scan results show that she has bleeding on both sides of her brain so, um... What is it? She has pressure on her brain due to the bleeding. Now, due to her low platelet count, that procedure, we would have to go in and drill. - No. No. - It's the standard-- Normally, it is a standard procedure but with her low platelet count, it is a dangerous procedure. No, no. Is she-- is she not gonna make it? - No, no, no, no. - What is he talking about? Ellissia's... Ellissia's condition is critical, but we are doing absolutely everything we can and we have a tremendous team of surgeons. They are assembled. They're standing by. This is one of those very tough times. So, uh, you might wanna get some rest. It's gonna be a long night. No. We're not moving from here. - Can I talk to you? - Yeah. We'll be right back. I'm not sure he's gonna make it. Daddy, I can't do it. Can you take me home? I just wanna die. There you go, boy. Good boy. Hey. Hey, peanut. How are you feeling? - Mom? - Mm-hm. Am I gonna die? No, you are not going to die. The swelling in your brain has gone down, honey. You're gonna be just fine. Now, you made it through the hardest part, so you get to rest now, okay? I'll leave you with your family. - Thank you, Doctor. - Yeah. And Jorge called. He said Centurion's gonna pull through, too. - Really? - Yeah. "May the Lord answer you in the day of trouble; May the name of the God of Jacob--" Sorry. Hi, Danny. Hi, Mrs. Hall. Okay. I'm going to grab a tea. Can I get you anything? No. Thank you. Okay. I miss you. I miss you, too. How've you been feeling? You know, I've been better. Well, I hope to see you at the Solano. Ow! I'm kidding. I'll be at Solano... to watch you ride Centurion. - Centurion? - Mm-hm. I know that he's not where Principe was, but if you work with George, he'll get there. Ellissia, I-I don't know. Why? It's your dad. Look, if there was a time to overcome fear, it's now. He would be so proud of you... And also, I might be a little impressed. This is KVYN 99.3 in the beautiful Napa Valley. Up next it's "Family" by Drew Holcomb and the Neighbors. Unbelievable. Ladies and gentlemen, Maribel Guardia. Our next rider, representing American Canyon... Francisco Gomez! You don't deserve to be here. Riding Cardo! Whoo! I hope Danny knows what he's up against. Now, representing Hall Ranch, Danny Sanchez! riding Centurion! Whoo! They look good together. Whoo! Oye, Ellissia. Would you like to dance with me? Let's get this, boy. Number 19 has stepped off of the platform and is disqualified from placing. Honey... Yes! What is he doing? - This is serious competition, honey. - I know. I know. Whoo! Whoo! After Danny and Centurion's amazing performance, they would be given the Audience Award. George and Danny would continue their special bond. Miguel's conscience got the best of him, and he turned in videos of Francisco... abusing horses. Centurion went on to become the darling of the horse dancing community. Mom and Dad fell even more in love with each other. I became a spokesperson for APL, and after finishing my two-year treatment protocol... I am leukemia free. Danny and I became more than just friends, and Rancho Centurion became the center of our lives. Oh, Ellissia, would you like to dance with me?
