Somewhere in La Mancha, in a place whose name I do not care to remember... For this blow, superb Caraculiambro, and you giants and fools! I have to remove this bad seed from the face of the earth! All against me! In your collapse and imprisonment, I must find a way to become famous and known for the valor of my arm and swings of my sword, discovered by all in the world! Come, I say! Come to me, gigantic and enormous people, who, because of my evil sins, or my good fortune, I shall unseat, or cut your body in half, or, in short, conquer and defeat you, and thus have someone to send who might enter and fall to his knees before my sweet lady, and say in the humble voice of surrender: "I, lady, am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island Malindrania, defeated in single combat by the never sufficiently praised knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who commanded me to appear before your mercy so that your greatness disposes of me at will!" Again those soulless books. Two days and two nights he's been reading. And from too little sleep and too much reading, his brain dried up. Advise the priest and Master Nicolás, the barber, of the bad state of the lord. - At this hour? It will be a fine hour if they manage to calm him down. What happened, uncle? What was that noise? You should know, my niece, that in this very place I killed four giants as big as four towers! It must have been a hard day. You're sweating. It's not sweat, but blood from the wounds I have received in battle! Niece, give me that precious drink that the wise Alquife brought, the great enchanter and friend of mine. So that you are healthy and calm. What do you think, Your Grace, of our misfortune? - Is he still slashing? - It's over. Here I go with this cold water that he imagines is divine balm. - How are you feeling? - Bring, bring! This precious liquor, the work of a charming friend of mine, leaves no trace of injury or sign of combat fatigue. Great fortune for a gentleman! Yes it will be, because it seems convenient and necessary, for the increase of my honor and the service of my republic, to become a knight errant. It's an idea worthy of Cid Ruy Díaz himself. He was a good knight. But he doesn't compare to the Blazing Sword, who with a single backstroke cut two fierce and colossal giants in half! Was that traitor Guenelon among them? Silence! For the chance to strike a blow at him, I would trade my housekeeper and even my niece! Well deserved. But now perhaps it would be wise to rest. Not so! For I shall take my armor and my horse to seek adventures righting all manner of wrongs! And, by seizing opportunity and placing myself in danger winning eternal renown and everlasting fame! Glory to Don Alonso Quixano the Great! No! From now on I shall be called Don Quixote of la Mancha! A name which, to my mind, clearly states my lineage and country! - And your horse? - Rocinante! A noble name, sonorous and reflective of what it had been when it was a nag! I see that you are very steadfast in your intentions. The only thing left to do is find a lady to love! For the knight errant without a lady-love is a tree without leaves or fruit a body without a soul! - And have you found her? Yes, beloved to whom I gave the title of lady of my thoughts! Don't you know her? Don't you suspect it? Her highness, the singular, the sweet Dulcinea of Toboso! Dulcinea of Toboso... I think she is a very good-looking farm wench with whom he once became enamored. -Aldonza Lorenzo? -Ah, so you know her? I believe that our neighbor will go ahead with his nonsensical dreams. God will dawn tomorrow, and provide an opportunity to prevent it. - He must have fallen asleep already. - So it seems. God, bring us a good morning. Fortunate the time and blessed the age when my famous deeds will come to light worthy of being carved in bronze, scuplted in marble, and painted on tablets as a remembrance in the future! O thou, wise enchanter, whoever thou mayest be, whose task it will be to chronicle this wondrous history! I implore thee not to overlook my good Rocinante, my eternal companion on all my travels and peregrinations. Jesus! Flee not, dear ladies, fear no villainous act from me! What's happening? Moderation is becoming in beauteous ladies, and laughter for no reason is foolishness. If, Señor, your grace seeks lodging, except for a bed, because there is none in this inn, a great abundance of everything else will be found here. For me, good castellan, anything will do, for my trappings are my weapons, and combat is my rest. This being true, you can surely dismount, certain of finding in this poor hovel reasons not to sleep in an entire year, let alone a single night. - Take care of my horse because it is the best mount that ever walked this earth. I never saw another that was even half as good... Come here, sir knight! Let us remove your armor! Never was a knight so well-served by ladies as was Don Quixote when he first sallied forth: fair damsels tended to him; princesses cared for his horse. or Rocinante, for this is the name, noble ladies, of my steed, and Don Quixote of la Mancha is mine. - I can't get this helmet off! -If we cut these cords... - I absolutely refuse to consent to that. The helmet is fine and there is no need to remove it. - Do you want to eat something? - I would consume any fare, because as I understand it, that would be most beneficial. Will your grace eat salt cod? Today is Friday and we have no other fish. - I am pleased with salt cod! Impossible. Give me a drink! Give me a drink! - There is a remedy for everything. - Help me! Help me! Ah, it's you! Never shall I rise up from this place, valiant knight, until thy courtesy grants me a boon I wish to ask of thee. Arise, good knight, that I will bestow upon you all I have to offer for your outstanding services. I expected no less of thy great magnificence, my lord. And so I shall tell thee the boon that I would ask of thee and thy generosity has granted me, and it is that on the morrow thou wilt dub me a knight. Knight? Tonight, in your chapel, I shall keep vigil over my armor and on the morrow, what I fervently desire will be accomplished. The truth is that in this castle there is no chapel to stand vigil over your arms, for it has been demolished in order to rebuild it. What a disappointment. Of course, if you need, you can stand vigil wherever you want. Tonight you can stand vigil in a courtyard of the castle, and in the morning, God willing, the necessary ceremonies will be performed so that you are dubbed a knight, and so much of a knight there could be no greater in all the world. - Show me the courtyard. - Let's go. You can put your weapons here. By the way, do you have any money? Money? I don't have a copper blanca. I never read in the histories of knights-errant - that any of them ever carried money. - Your grace is deceived. If this was not written, it was because it had not seemed necessary to the authors to write down something as obvious and necessary as carrying money and clean shirts. I promise to do as you advise with great alacrity. - Go with God. - May he protect us well. A new breed of madness! Arm yourself knight! Castilian Lord! How many wrongs have you committed? -How many widows have you bedded? -Look at him! Look at him! O thou, whosoever thou art, rash knight, who cometh to touch the armor of the most valiant knight who e’er girded on a sword! Lookest thou to what thou dost and toucheth it not, if thou wanteth not to leave thy life in payment for thy audacity. Help me, Señora, in this the first affront aimed at this thy servant’s bosom! - He's lost it! -Come on, he's crazy! - Halt! Perfidious traitors! - Let's get him! Halt, you bastards! And you, lord of the castle, discourteous knight! You allow knights errant to be so badly treated? Leave him! If he goes crazy he may kill us all! Fine, we will leave him, but let's get rid of him. Sir Knight, leave these wounded men. I promise to give you the order of chivalry before another misfortune occurs. - And those brutes? Pardon me for the impudence these lowborn knaves have shown, which I knew nothing about, but they have been rightfully punished for their audacity. Let them take this carrion! I am ready to obey you. And for the record, if I am attacked again after I have been dubbed a knight, I do not intend to leave a single person alive in this castle! Except for those that you order me to spare, out of respect for you. Kneel down. You two, come here. Diego Bargas' Account: 2 arrobas of barley - 10 rs, 1 peck of straw - 3 maravedís, 1 bale of hay - half escudo 2 days for a donkey - 3 reales Rise. Gird his sword. May God make your grace a very fortunate knight. - What is your name, madam? - Tolosa. I am the daughter of a cobbler from Toledo, and no matter where I am I will serve you and consider you my master. For the sake of my love, have the kindness to henceforth ennoble yourself and call yourself Doña Tolosa. - I will do so. Tie up his spurs. And you, my lady, what is your name? Molinera, I am the daughter of an honorable miller from Antequera. I impolore you to ennoble yourself and call yourself Doña Molinera. For this gift, I offer you more services and good turns. I am the one who owes you, madam, for the good you've done me. Fortune offers you adventures worthy of your strong arm. Boy, bring his horse. I have to return to my house to follow your advice about the money and the clean shirts, and to look for a squire. - Go in good time! Halt, all of you, unless all of you confess that in the entire world there is no damsel more beauteous than the empress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea of Toboso. - Be calm. - Can't you see he's crazy? Señor Knight, we do not know this good lady you have mentioned. Show us her portrait, even if it is no larger than a grain of wheat, even if it shows that she is blind in one eye with blood flowing from the other. Nothing flows from her, vile rabble, but amber and delicate musk! But you will pay for how you have blasphemed against beauty as extraordinary as that of my lady! Flee not, cowards! Wretches! Let's go! Confess everything I've demanded of you! Take heed, for it is no fault of mine but of my mount that I lie here! Take that! Knight errant! Succor me, my lady! Where art thou, my lady, that thou weepest not for my ills? Dost thou not know of them, lady, or art thou truly false? Señor Quixano! Señor Quixano! Who has done this to your grace? Are you injured? O noble Marquis of Mantua, mine uncle and natural lord! Look, your grace, poor sinner that I am I am not the Marquis of Mantua, but Pedro Alonso, your neighbor. Come with me to town. Your graces, open to Señor Marquis of Mantua who is badly wounded! - What's going on? - What happened to you, sir? - Where did you find him? - Are you injured? Stop, all of you, for I have been sorely wounded on account of my horse. Take me to my bed and call, if such is possible, Urganda the Wise, that she may heal my wounds. Look what is wrong with my master. Take this, lord priest, and sprinkle this room with holy water. Don't leave any enchanter of the many in these books. Hand me them one by one, for I might find a few that do not deserve to be punished in flames. Why pardon any of them? - Let's at least read the titles. - Bring them. - "The Four Books of Amadís of Gaul." - We’ll spare its life... for now. - "The Exploits of Esplandián." - Take it, Señora. Open that window, throw it into the corral, and start the pile that will fuel the fire we shall set. - Here, here, valiant knights! - My god, not again! Each must show the might of his valiant arm for the courtiers are winning the tourney! Be still, my friend, for it is God’s will that fortune changes, and that what is lost today is won tomorrow. In truth, Señor Archbishop Turpín, it is a great discredit to those of us called the Twelve Peers! Your grace should tend to your health now. Your grace must be fatigued, if not badly wounded. Not wounded, but bruised and broken, there is no doubt. For now bring me food, since that is what I need most at present, and leave my revenge to me! The housekeeper is preparing a stew with more beef than lamb and a squab as a treat. Eat this, your grace, and then there's eggs and sausage. Let's let him gain strength, he will need it for the tourney. We're having a tourney? This door will open when I'm in Babia. Antonia! Madame! Open for the knight Don Quixote of la Mancha, of whom the world awaits great astonishment! - Just another day for Don Alonso. - God knows why. Wise Alquife, great charmer and friend of mine, free me while I'm deprived of liberty! Careful, Sancho! Oh, my loins! I already knew, powerful enchanter, that you would not leave your friend in such a grave prison. - Me, an enchanter? Unfortunately not. Rather, your grace, I am Sancho Panza, of the Panzas lineage. Ay! And I rent this house. Although you don't know it, Sancho, a great enchanter has sent you to do a great service and get me out of this prison. I understand that my friend the wise Alquife has designated you as the squire that I need and that my good fortune has allowed. And what would the lady say if she ever found out? Are you so afraid? So much so that, to avoid an argument, I would pay rent with incense. Keep in mind that I offer you, in faith as a knight errant, a position of sugh high dignity unlike any other in the world. How much can knights errant earn? It might happen that one day I would have an adventure that would gain me, in the blink of an eye, an ínsula, and I would make you its governor. - In that case... With such good fortune at stake and your grace promising so much... - Are you determined to follow me? - I'm determined. I will go with your grace and serve as your squire. Get ready to leave tonight and help me off the balcony. Bring along saddlebags. I will bring money and clean shirts. I will also take my donkey, which is very good, because I'm not one for walking. I don't remember any knight errant who had with him a squire riding on a donkey... - Well... - Bring it! And I will acquire the horse of the first discourteous knight I happen to meet! My lord, don't forget about the ínsula you promised me. I’ll know how to govern it no matter how big it is. You must know, my friend Sancho Panza, that if you live and I live, it well might be that before six days have passed I shall win a kingdom that would be perfect for my crowning you king. If I became king, Teresa, my missus, would be queen, and my children would be princes. - Who can doubt it? - I doubt it. Even if God rained kingdoms down on earth, none of them would sit well on the head of Teresa Panza. You should know, Señor, she's not worth two maravedís as a queen. She’d do better as a countess, and even then she'd need God’s help. Good fortune is guiding our affairs better than we could have desired! See there, my friend Sancho Panza, thirty or more enormous giants? With them I intend to do battle and take all of their lives! - What giants? - Those ones with the long arms almost two leagues long! - Look, your grace, those things over there aren’t giants, they're windmills! And what looks like their arms are their sails. It's clear to me thou art not well-versed in adventures. These are giants! And if thou art afraid, move aside and start to pray whilst I enter with them in fierce and unequal combat! Stop, your grace! They are not giants! Flee not, cowards and base creatures, for it is a single knight who attacks you! Even if you move more arms than the giant Briareus, you will answer to me! O, Dulcinea of Toboso, aid me! God save me! Sancho! Didn’t I tell your grace to watch what you were doing? Only someone with windmills on the brain could have failed to see this! Be quiet. I believe the wise Frestón has turned these giants into windmills in order to deprive me of the glory of their defeat. But his evil arts will not prevail against the power of my virtuous sword! - God's will be done. Be advised that even if you see me in the greatest danger in the world, you are not to put a hand to your sword to defend me if you see that my attackers are knights. Then that’s just what I’ll do, as faithfully as I keep the Sabbath on Sunday. Either I am deceived, or this will be the most famous adventure ever seen. because those black shapes are without a doubt enchanters who have captured some princess in that carriage. This will be worse than the windmills! Look, Señor, those are friars of St. Benedict, and the carriage must belong to some travelers. I've already told you that you know little of adventures. You'll see it's true! You wicked and monstrous creatures, unhand the noble princesses you hold captive in that carriage, or else prepare to receive a swift death, as just punishment for your evil deeds. Señor, we are neither wicked nor monstrous, we are two friars traveling on our way, and we do not know of any princesses in that carriage. No soft words with me! I know who you are, perfidious rabble! Ave María! My noble ladies, the arrogance of thy captors here lieth on the ground, vanquished by this my mighty arm. Go on, mister, you go wrong; by God who make me, if don’t let carriage go, as I be Basque I kill you. If you were a gentleman, as you are not, I would already have punished your foolishness and audacity. Unhappy creature! Not gentleman me? As Christian I make vow to God you lie. Throw away lance and pull out sword and soon see which one make horse drink. Now you shall see. Take this, you can use it as a shield. O, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to the aid of this thy knight. Surrender, or by God I'll cut off your head! We implore you, do us the favor of sparing the life of our squire. I am very happy to do as you ask, but this knight must go to Toboso and present himself to the peerless Dulcinea, so that she may do with him as she pleases. - We promise he will. - With confidence in that promise, I shall do him no more harm. Sancho, I have won! Thank you, my God! Sancho, brother! May it please your grace to give me the governorship of the ínsula that you have won in this fierce combat? - Brother Sancho, have patience. For now, what I beg of your grace is that we treat your wounds. A lot of blood is coming out of that ear, and I have lint and a little salve in the saddlebags. None of that would be needed if I remembered to prepare a flask of the balm of Fierabrás. What flask and what balm is that? It is a balm, with which one need have no fear of death, or dread dying of any wound. I take a vow, to the Creator of all things, to eat no bread at the table until such time that I take by force another helmet just as good as this one from some other knight or the very helmet of Mambrino. Look, your grace, on these roads, there are no armed men, only mules and wagondrivers, and they don’t have helmets, and maybe never heard of them in all their days. But this is the day that the valor of my arm will be proved. Do you see that cloud of dust rising there? Well, it conceals a vast army which is marching toward us. - If that’s the case, there must be two, because over in the opposite direction there's another cloud of dust. That is the truth, and rejoice because these two armies will attack and fight each other in the middle of that broad plain. Señor, then what should we do? Defend and protect the needy and helpless. You must know, Sancho, that the army in front of us is led and directed by the great Emperor Alifanfarón, lord of the great Ínsula Trapobane. the other, marching behind us, belongs to his enemy, the king of the Garamantes, Pentapolín of the Tucked-up Sleeve, so-called because he always enters into battle with a bare right arm. Why do these gentlemen hate each other so much? They hate each other because this Alifanfarón, a fierce pagan, is in love with Pentapolín’s daughter, a beauteous Christian, whose father does not wish to surrender her unless he first renounces the law of his false prophet Mohammed. By my beard, Pentapolín is right! And I’m bound to help him any way I can! You would be doing as you should, Sancho, because to enter into battles such as these it is not required to be dubbed a knight. Señor, I entrust to the devil what your grace says. - At least I don't see it. - What are you saying? Do you not hear the neighing of the horses, the call of the clarions, the sound of the drums? I don’t hear anything except the bleating of lots of sheep. It is your fear, Sancho, that keeps you from seeing or hearing properly. Your grace, come back, it is rams and sheep you are charging! Knights of the valiant Emperor Pentapolín of the Tucked-up Sleeve, follow me, all of you! And you will see how easily I give you revenge upon your enemy Alifanfarón of Trapobane! Where art thou, haughty Alifanfarón? Come here to me, for I am only one knight. Be calm! This is madness! No, not that! Oh! No, not that! Didn’t I tell you, your grace, that it wasn’t armies you were attacking but flocks of sheep? This is how that thieving wise man, my enemy, can make things disappear and seem to be what they are not. You should know, Sancho, that it is very easy for those like him to make us see whatever they wish, and this villain has turned the contending armies into flocks of sheep. I have need of your help and assistance. See how many molars and teeth I have lost. How many molars did your grace have on this side? Four. All of them sound and healthy. Think carefully, your grace, about what you're saying. I say four, or perhaps five. Well, in this lower part your grace has no more than two and a half molars, and in the upper part, none at all, not even a half, it’s all as smooth as the palm of your hand. The wounds received in battles bestow honor, they do not take it away. So Panza, my friend, stand the best you can and put me any way you choose on the back of your donkey, and let us leave before night falls upon us in this deserted place. Let's go, Señor. - Thanks be to God! An inn! - It is not an inn, but a castle. If that's a castle, I wouldn't know my own mother. It's an inn, and badly in need of repair. A castle, I tell you! And an important castle from what I can see. Be that as it may, let's go in without further debate. What happened to this knight? It's nothing, he fell off a crag and bruised his ribs slightly. Poor señor. Come, daughter, and you Maritornes. We'll show them to bed so they can heal. - What bed, mother? - Above, with the muledriver. Blessed Virgin, what bruises! It looks more like a beating than a fall. It wasn’t a beating, it’s just that the rock had lots of sharp points and edges and each one left its bruise. - What’s this gentleman’s name? Don Quixote of la Mancha, and he is an adventuring knight What’s an adventuring knight? Are you so new to the world that you don’t know? Well, let me tell you, in just a few words he is someone who’s beaten and then finds himself emperor. Believe me, beauteous lady, thou canst call thyself fortunate for having welcomed into this thy castle my person. My squire wilt tell thee who I am I say only that I shall carry eternally written in my memory the service that thou hast rendered me. And if love didn't hold me captive to its laws, this beautiful maiden's eyes would surely be the masters of my liberty. Thank you, Señor Knight. And goodbye, you are already cured. What was he saying, mother? I understood no more than if he had been speaking Greek. - Already off to bed? - Yes, will you come? Wait for me after midnight. I lie so bruised and broken, O beauteous and exalted lady, that even if I deeply desired to satisfy thine own desires, it would be impossible. - What are you saying? Further, I have sworn faithfulness to the incomparable Dulcinea of Toboso. If this great obstacle did not loom between us, I would not turn away from so gladsome an opportunity as this that thy great kindness affords me. Who do you think you are? Let go of me! Miserable wretch! Villain! Scoundrel! Traitor! Villain and a thousand times villain! Must be about Maritornes... Stop in the name of the law! And of the Holy Brotherhood! Maritornes, where are you? Where are you? Lock the door of the inn! Nobody leaves! A man's been killed here! Stop in the name of the Holy Brotherhood! Stop in the name of the Holy Brotherhood! - Sancho, my friend, are you sleeping? - How could I sleep? It seems that all the devils in hell had their way with me tonight. You should know that a short while ago, the daughter of the lord of this castle came to me. And what can I say of the other hidden things which, in order to keep the faith I owe to my lady Dulcinea of Toboso, I shall keep inviolate and pass over in silence? Yes, she is one of the most elegant and beauteous damsels to be found anywhere on earth. But without my seeing or knowing whence it came a hand attached to the arm of some giant came down and struck me so hard a blow on the jaws that they were bathed in blood. And from this I conjecture that the treasure of this maiden’s beauty must be guarded by some enchanted Moor and is not intended for me. Not for me either, because more than four hundred Moors gave me such a beating that the attack by the staffs was like cakes and icing. Do not be distressed, for I shall prepare the precious balm that you know about. Señor, can this be the enchanted Moor checking the inkwell? How goes it, my good man? I would speak with more courtesy. Is it the custom in this land to speak in that manner to knights errant, you dolt? He is doubtlessly alive and well. No doubt this man is the enchanted Moor, who is guarding the treasure for others, but for us he only has fists and blows with lamps. That is true. Get up, Sancho, if you can. Summon the warder of this fortress, and persuade him to give me some oil, wine, salt, and rosemary so that I may prepare the health-giving balm. Oil. Rosemary. Salt. - And wine. - Now we have to cook it. For a while. My lord says it is a divine balm. But it will need a prayer. Because I don't know that these things work miracles. Pater noster qui es in caelis. Now give me the can of balm. In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. It's marvelous! Sancho. Sancho. Sancho! What do you want, your grace? The balm has worked its wonders, and I feel cured and healthy, and want to leave immediately to seek adventures. I... can't move... For me the balm was poisonous. I believe that you are ill because you have not been dubbed a knight, for I am of the opinion that this potion is not suitable for those who are not knights. Curse me and all my kin! If your grace knew that, why did you let me taste it? - Stay there. I'll saddle Rocinante myself and put the saddle on your dapple. Many and great are the kindnesses, Señor Warder, which I have received in this thy castle, and I am obligated to show thee my gratitude for all time. All I need from your grace is that you pay for the night you spent in the inn: straw and feed for your two animals, and your supper and your beds. - Then, this is an inn? - And a very honorable one - Then I have been deceived all along! for in truth I thought this was a castle, and not a bad one. What you can do now is await the payment, for I cannot contravene the order of knights errant, about whom I know it is true, that they never paid for their lodging! That has nothing to do with me! Pay me what you owe me, and leave off your stories and chivalries! You are a fool and a bad innkeeper! - Then you'll pay for the both of you! - Since my master did not want to pay, - I won't pay either. - Why not? Because as the squire of a knight errant, the same rule and law applies to me in not paying anything in hostelries and inns. -No? - No! - You insist on not paying? - I insist! - Is that so? - That is so. Oh my! Sir! - I can't hear you! - Oh my! I don't even have a maravedí! - And a one! And a two! And a one! And a two! - And a one! And a two! - Stop! You swine! If I was not enchanted, I would make you respect my squire! And a one! And a two! Go! And a one! And a two! Go! Let's pack it in! Have this. Sancho, my son! Don't drink the water, it will kill you! - Here I have the blessed balm. - Have you forgotten I'm not a knight? Or do you want me to finish throwing up whatever's left in my guts from last night? It couldn't have been wine? The better and smarter thing, to the best of my poor understanding, would be for us to go back home now that it’s harvesttime. How little you know, Sancho, about chivalry! The pleasure of conquering in battle and defeating one’s enemy! That must be true, only we haven't won a single battle except for the one with the Basque. It seems to me, Sancho, that one door closes and another opens. Unless I am mistaken, coming toward us is a man who wears on his head the helmet of Mambrino, to which I have made a vow. - Your grace, be careful what you say Do you not see that knight mounted on a dappled gray and wearing on his head a helmet of gold? What I see is a man riding a donkey that's gray like mine, and wearing something shiny on his head. Well that is the helmet of Mambrino! Move aside! And you will see that the helmet I have long desired will be mine! - May God make it oregano! - Defend yourself, base creature! Hand over to me of your own free will what is so rightly mine! The heathen behaved with discretion. Pick up the helmet. By God, this is a good basin, worth eight reales if it’s worth a maravedí. - Why are you laughing, Sancho? - I'm laughing considering this helmet looks exactly like a barber's basin. Be that as it may, I recognize it, and its transmutation does not matter to me, for I shall repair it in the first village with a blacksmith, to protect me from any more stones thrown. It will if they’re not using a slingshot, like in the battle of the two armies, when they signed the cross over your grace’s molars. Who are they? It's a chain of galley slaves, people forced by the king to go to the galleys. - What do you mean, forced? Is it possible that the king forces anyone? I’m not saying that, but these are people condemned for crimes to serve in the king's galleys by force. In short, these people are not going of their own free will. That’s right. I deduce that although you are being punished for your faults, the penalties you are about to suffer are not to your liking, and I want to ask these gentlemen, the guards and the commissary, to be so good as to unchain you and let you go in peace, for to me it seems harsh to make slaves of those whom God and nature made free. There is a God in heaven who does not fail to punish the wicked or reward the good, and it is not right for honorable men To persecute other men. Be on your way, your grace, Señor! Straighten that basin on your head and stop looking for a three-legged cat. You are the cat, the rat, and the scoundrel! Get out of here now. The road is wide. Don't even think of looking back. There's good rocks there to break the chains. Let's flee. The Holy Brotherhood will look for the lawbreakers. Let's go hide in the nearby mountains. That is all very well and good, but I know what must be done now. Señores, it is customary for wellborn people to give thanks for the benefits they receive. I say this because it is my will that you set out on the path to Toboso, and there appear before the lady Dulcinea, and say that her knight, he of the Sorrowful Face, commends himself to her. I have always heard, Sancho, that doing good to the lowborn is throwing water into the sea. But what's done is done. Patience... and let it be a lesson for the future. Your grace will learn the lesson the same way I’m a Turk. Let's go to the mountains. The Holy Brotherhood wouldn’t give two maravedís for all the knights errant in the world. You are naturally a coward, Sancho. But this time I will take your advice and withdraw from the ferocity that frightens you so. - But it must be on one condition! - What is it? That never are you to say that I retreated from this danger out of fear but only to satisfy your pleas. Señor, withdrawing is not running away. This is the place I choose, O heavens, to weep for my misfortune! What will your grace do in this lonely place? Sancho, have I not told you that I wish to imitate Amadis, playing the victim of despair, the madman, the maniac. I don't believe so, but why does your grace have to go crazy? Has my lady Dulcinea done anything foolish with Moor or Christian? The thing is to show my lady that if I do all this when dry, what would I not do when wet? Mad I am and mad I shall remain... ...until you return with the reply to a letter which I intend to send with you to my lady Dulcinea. - I will go willingly. - In three days hence you will leave here, because in that time I want you to see what I do and say for her sake. What else do I have to see that I haven't already? Now I have to tear my clothes, toss aside my armor, and hit my head against these rocks. Your grace should be careful about hitting your head, because on a hard boulder, with your first blow you'll end your penance. Let's have the letter. I’ll say goodbye and be on my way. My good squire, Sancho, will recount the entire tale to thee, O ungrateful beauty! My beloved enemy! the state I am reduced to for thy sake: if it be thy desire to succor me, I am thine; if not, by ending my life I shall have satisfied both thy cruelty and mine own desire. Thine until death, The Knight of the Sorrowful Face. By my father’s life, that’s the highest thing I’ve ever heard. Take it. And now, your grace, give me your blessing. At least, Sancho, I want you to see me naked and performing one or two dozen mad acts. For the love of God, Señor, don’t let me see your grace naked, for that will make me feel so bad I won’t be able to stop crying. Goodbye. Take care of yourself, your grace. I say, Señor, so that I can swear that I saw you do crazy things, it's a good idea that I see at least one. Wait, Sancho, and I shall do them before you can say a Credo. I believe I can swear that he is crazy. God save you, Mary, you are full of grace, the Lord is with you ... The fact is that we have lost his trail and God knows where he's going. - What can we do? - Wait for God's will. Tell me, Señor Priest, isn't that Sancho Panza? - It is. - Sancho! Sancho! My friend Sancho Panza, where is your master? He is busy somewhere with something very important. Sancho, if you don't tell us where he is, we'll think that you killed and robbed him. I’m not the kind of man that robs or kills. My master is doing penance in those mountains. And why did you leave him? Because I'm carrying a letter to the lady Dulcinea of Toboso, who he is head over heels in love with. Show us the letter and we'll see if it's true. Damn me! I've lost Dulcinea's letter! Tell it to us, Sancho, and we'll transcribe it. The beginning said... "High and sullied lady..." and then something about sending her health and sickness, and then it just went along until it ended with "Thine until death, - the Knight of the Sorrowful Face." - Good memory! Come in. And calmly tell us anything else there is to say. The important thing is to get Don Quixote out of the mountains and put you on the path to being king or emperor... And he can thank his squire with the ínsula he promised me. That's it, but you'll need to go find him wherever he is. - You will guide us. - What if he asks if I delivered the letter to Señora Dulcinea? - You tell him yes., and that she demands, this instant, that he come to Toboso to see her for something very important. - Rest assured I'll say just that. If we go in disguise, don't be surprised by our outfits or say that you know us. It is all important, so Don Quixote can win the empire he deserves. For me... We will find my lord very close. Bring him the response we gave on behalf of Dulcinea. And if he still won't come out, let us know. We'll wait for you here. He is sure to come out. - Who are you? - What are you doing here? If you have any food to give me, then give it to me in the name of God. Take this until you are full. Tell me, how did you come to this end? If you wish me to tell you the immensity of my misfortunes, you must promise not to interrupt the thread of my sad history because the moment you interrupt, is when it ends. - I promise on both our behalf. My name is Cardenio, my home, one of the finest cities in Andalucía. my family, noble; my parents, wealthy. In these same lands there lived a heaven. Luscinda. A maiden as noble and as wealthy as I. I loved her and she loved me. Our parents knew of our intentions and were not troubled by them. It happened that I was the best friend of the duke's youngest son, named Fernando. He loved a peasant girl, one of his father’s vassals, and promised to be her husband. I praised Luscinda's beauty in such a way that my praise awakened in him a desire to see her. He saw her, and he fell so in love with my beloved that he asked his father for a wife and she agreed to commit the blackest betrayal. I went crazy and ran away not knowing what I was doing. One dawn I found myself in these lands I walk through. My abode is in the hollow of a cork tree, and in this way, I spend my miserable life. - Didn't you wait to see if Fernando and Luscinda's wedding took place? I never knew more of my misfortune. Who, then, will improve my fate? Death. And who in love claims victory? Perfidy. And who can make its ills grow less? Madness And therefore, it’s no act of reason to attempt to cure this passion when the remedies, in truth, are madness, perfidy, and death. Who makes all my joy to wane? Disdain. And who prolongs this misery? Jealousy. And who assails and tears my patience? Absence. And therefore, in my deep-felt sorrow, I see no cure on the morrow, for I am killed by... Stop, señora, those you see here only intend to serve you. What your clothes, Señora, deny, your hair reveals. It would be useless for me to pretend So that you will have no doubts about my honor, I shall tell you what I should prefer to keep quiet, I, señores, spent my modest life in my parents' house, where I could not see more than the ground where I placed my feet. yet the eyes of love saw me in Don Fernando, the younger son of the duke and lord of my village. Don Fernando, to declare his desire to me, bribed our household servants. One night I was in my bedroom, my sole companion a lady’s maid, I found him standing before me. "Dorotea," he told me... - Your name is Dorotea? - That's right. And Don Fernando picked up a holy image that was in the room and called on it to witness our betrothal. And with this, my maid then left the room, I ceased to be one, and he became a traitor and a liar. And then? Some days later, the talk in the village was that he married a maiden named Luscinda. But during the wedding, a letter was found, which declared that she could not be Don Fernando's wife because she was Cardenio's, a distinguished gentleman of the same city. Are you Dorotea, the daughter of Clenardo? Yes. To flee my shame, I put on these clothes and entered these mountains, having no other thought than to hide and run away from my father. But, who are you that you know my father’s name? That luckless man Luscinda declared to be her husband. I am Cardenio. I also fled without knowing the end of my misfortune. And if Luscinda did not marry Don Fernando, we can hope that heaven will restore what is ours. Señor Priest! - Master Nicolás! - Sancho! - Did you find your lord? - Yes, where I left him. Thin, yellow, famished, and sighing for his lady Dulcinea. - And you didn't give him the message? - Yes I did. He is resolved not come before her beauteousness until he has performed feats deserving of her grace Notice... This young man, who is a beautiful lady, is the heir by direct male line of the great kingdom of Micomicón, and she has come looking for your master to beg of him to right a wrong done to her by an evil giant. - Right, Master Nicolás? - That's right, as you say. A lucky finding, but I want to beg of your grace, to advise my master to marry this princess right away, and then he'll come into his empire, and I the government of my ínsula. As for your master marrying, I’ll do everything in my power. Fortune no doubt favors us, since she has begun to open the door to your remedy, and has provided us with what we needed. - What do you mean? - Hidden in this mountain, performing mad acts, is a gentleman friend of ours. Poor Don Quixote, who ran away from home because of books of chivalry. Our purpose was to bring him back to his house by making him believe that Master Nicolás, this damsel in distress, needed the strength of his arm. I see. Dorotea could play the afflicted damsel better than your friend. And I'll do it gladly. What's more, I have the clothes to play the part naturally. Then, Master Nicolás, wear the squire costume I have in my pack. There he is. I shall not rise up from this place, O valiant and brave knight, until thy goodness and courtesy grant me a boon. I shall not utter a word, beauteous lady until thou is raised from the ground. I shall not raise myself if thy courtesy doth not grant me the boon. I grant and bestow it, as long as it doth not harm nor diminish my king, my country, and she who holds the key to my heart and liberty. Then the gift I ask is that thy magnanimous person maketh a vow not to engage in any other adventure until thou hast taken revenge upon a traitor who hath usurped my kingdom. - I do grant it! And with the help of God and this my arm thou wilt see thyself restored to thy kingdom in spite of and despite the base cowards who wisheth to deny it to thee. Arm me, and let us leave here, in the name of God, to succor this great lady. Well met, O paragon of chivalry, Don Quixote of La Mancha, quintessence of knight errantry. - Welcome to my home. - How is my lord Don Quixote arriving? Very broken. Prepare a better bed for me than last time. If you pay better than last time, I'll provide a prince's bed. Have you recovered from the blanket toss? Shall we wake him to eat? For the moment, he needs sleep more than food. Certainly, he was out of breath. Come, Señores, and help my master! He's in the fiercest battle I've ever seen! What's going on? My God, what a thrust he gave to the giant, the enemy of Princess Micomicona when he cut his head off just like a turnip! Thief! Scoundrel! I have you now! Die! - I'm not dying! - Look at my vintage! My leathers! My wine! Drop the sword, damn knight...! This has a remedy. Damn knight! By the bones of my father, he'll pay me what he owes or my name isn’t what it is! You want to water down my wine? Great battle, heaven knows! - Did you see it, Sancho? - Calm down. And the blood flowed like a fountain. What blood are you talking about, enemy of God and all his saints! Don't you see that the blood is nothing but the red wine flooding this room? I know if I don't find that head, my countship will dissolve away like salt in water. May your grace be calmed, my lord. Yes, calm down. It would do you well to sleep. Lie down. Now your highness, your noble and illustrious ladyship, may live in the certainty that this lowborn creature can do you no harm. - Fathert! - What do you want? A beautiful collection of guests is coming! - Come, come. Welcome, noble gentlemen. Notice that in this inn, we welcome you all. Prepare something to eat. Your graces will be well served. What troubles you, Señora? I am happy to offer my services to you. Do not waste your time offering anything to her, and do not encourage a response, unless you wish to hear a lie. I have never told one, and of this you are a witness. Luscinda! Cardenio! Let me go, Don Fernando! Since heaven has brought my true husband before me... Perhaps with my death, he will be convinced that I kept faith with him until the very end. Luscinda! What do you intend to do? Can't you see that you are my sole refuge? Arise, Señora; It is not right for the woman to whom I once swore my love to kneel at my feet Your illustrious lineage is well proven. Then you didn't get married? - I went to a convent. - I forcibly removed her, to stop at this inn where all this damage will be repaired. Turn your eyes, Cardenio, to Luscinda, and I shall pray that heaven grant me my Dorotea. Your grace can sleep all you want to now, it’s all over and done with. - I believe that. because with that giant I have had the most furious battle I think I shall ever have in all my days. Know, your grace, that the dead giant is a slashed wineskin, his blood, six arrobas of red wine. Have you lost your mind? Get up and you'll see the queen transformed into a lady named Dorotea. - I shall not marvel at any of it. If you remember, all the things that occurred in this place were works of enchantment. Give me my clothes. In short, if we are to save the poor knight, Luscinda can act the part played by Dorotea, until he is brought home. - By no means. I want Dorotea to go on with the fiction. His village is probably not far from here. It's two days' travel. - Even if it were more... - Quiet. They're coming down. I have been informed, O beauteous lady, that you have turned into an ordinary damsel. Whoever told you, O valiant knight, that I had changed my being did not tell you the truth. - Enough! Since the princess wants to set out tomorrow, let it be so, and we can spend tonight in pleasant conversation. I offer to guard the castle, because we are not going to be attacked by any giant or any other wicked mess. - As you please. Truly, Señores, if one considers it carefully, great and wonderful are the things seen by those who profess the order of knight errantry, whose purpose and objective is peace, which is the greatest good that men can desire in this life. And so, the first good news that the world and men received was brought by angels on the night that was our day, when they sang in the air: "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men." The reply of my arms is that peace cannot be sustained without arms, because with arms nations are defended, kingdoms maintained, cities defended, seas are cleared, roads made secure. For who in this world, coming through the door of this castle does not see the Knight of the Sorrowful Face whose name is on the lips of fame watching over the dream of the great queen we all know she is. It's an inn! Knights! You have no reason to call at the gates of this castle! Withdraw until we see if it is proper for them to open to you or not. What the devil kind of castle is this? If you’re the innkeeper, then open for us. - Do I look like an innkeeper? - I don't know what you look like, but I know you're a fool when you call this inn a castle. Step aside! Come in, come in, welcome. Ah, Don Thief, I have you now! Give me back my basin and my saddle and the harness you stole from me! Help, in the name of the king and of justice! This thief, this highway robber, is trying to kill me! You lie! My master, Don Quixote, won these spoils in righteous combat! This saddle is as much mine as the death I owe to God, and there’s my donkey, and he won’t let me lie. And on the same day they took a brand-new brass basin from me! False! Your graces may see the error of this good squire, for he calls a basin what was and always will be the helmet of Mambrino! I shall not negotiate the packsaddle. Bring me the helmet! I swear by the order of chivalry which I profess that this helmet is the same one I took from him, and nothing has been added to it or taken away. There’s no doubt about that. What do your graces think of what they’re saying? They still insist that this isn’t a basin but a helmet. And whoever says it is not, if he is a gentleman, I shall show him that he lies, and if he is a squire, that he lies a thousand times over! You should know, Señor Barber, that I too follow your trade. I know very well all the tools of barbering, and I say that this piece is not a basin. I also say that this helmet is not a complete helmet. No, of course not, for half of it, the visor, is missing. That is true. Lord save me! Is it possible that so many honorable people are saying that this is not a basin but a helmet? Then this packsaddle must also be a horse’s harness! It looks like a saddle to me, but I've already said I shall not negotiate that. Señor Don Quixote has spoken well, and it's up to us to decide. I shall take the votes of these gentlemen in secret and give a report on the outcome. The fact is, my good man, no one does not say this is not a packsaddle, but a horse's harness, even a thoroughbred's. All that can be done now is for each man to take what is his, and may St. Peter bless what God has given us. It's a saddle as sure as I know my father, and whoever says otherwise must be bleary-eyed with drink. Thou liest like the base villain thou art! Help for the Holy Brotherhood! Hold, all of you! Sheathe your swords! Stop fighting! Listen to me, if you wish to live! One of you take the part of King Agramante and the other that of King Sobrino and make peace - I don't have to listen to you. We have a warrant from the Holy Brotherhood for the arrest of this highway robber. - Listen up. - Give us our prisoner! You should not take him. As I see it, he will not allow himself to be taken. And if he is caught, he'll be released for insanity. It's true. I will pay the unhappy barber 8 reales for the basin plus whatever is fair for the saddle., and we'll speak no more of it. We should prevent the knight from causing more craziness! Don't worry, we'll take him back home by enchantment, and tonight, while he's asleep... O, Knight of the Sorrowful Face! Grieve not at thy imprisonment, for it is needful in order to more quickly conclude the adventure to which thy great courage hath brought thee. O thou, whoever thou mayest be, who hath foretold such bliss for me, I implore thee that thou asketh the wise enchanter who controlleth my affairs, not to allow me to perish in this prison until the promises hath been fulfilled! I have read many histories of knights errant, but never have the enchanted been carried in this fashion, at the pace of sluggish animals. - I don’t know what I think. But these phantoms wandering around here are not entirely Catholic. Catholic? By my sainted father! How can they be Catholic if they are demons? Weepeth not, good ladies. Forgive me if I hath offended you. Implore God that He taketh me from this prison, where an evil enchanter hath placed me! Miss! Señora Noelia! -Your uncle is coming in a cage! - What are you saying? How did you say my lord is coming? -On an oxcart! - Oh my God! - You hate to see it. - Ay, uncle! In these bad times they should burn those who wrote cavalry books! - May God bless him. - And free him from all evil. He knows by now how long it took to find him and bring him back to his house. - And you think he's cured? Look at those piercing eyes. As if he can't quite understand where he is. Take care of him. Give him good food. Me, gentlemen! That the knights errant shall write my feats in gold letters! And the strength of my courage and my arm have an appointment with the most prodigious adventures that the centuries have ever seen! I am a knight errant! Not one of those whose names were never remembered by Fame or eternalized in her memory, but one who in spite of envy herself, and in defiance of all the magi of Persia, will have his name inscribed in the temple of immortality so that it may serve as an example and standard to future times, when knights errant can see the path they must follow if they wish to reach the honorable zenith and pinnacle of the practice of arms! The words of Don Quixote, amplified by the tongues of Fame, spread throughout the world. And it so happened that a wise Arab historian, aware of his exploits, gave them to the printing press. Children looked at them, youths read them, men understood them, and the old celebrated them. In short, it was the most popular, widely read, and well-known story by every kind of person. Thus arriving from Salamanca, luminary of knowledge and light of the world, comes the bachelor Sansón Carrasco, graduated in instruction and very sly, whose hands carry the first book of The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha which made known to all the great folly of their neighbor. Last night Bartolomé Carrasco’s son, returned from Salamanca with a bachelor's degree, and he told me that the history of your grace is in books and it’s called The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha; and he says that in it they mention me, Sancho Panza, by name, and my lady Dulcinea of Toboso. I assure you, Sancho, that the author of our history must be some wise enchanter, According to Sansón Carrasco, for that is the bachelor's name, the author of the history is Cide Hamete Berenjena. - That is a Moorish name. - That may be. And if your grace would like me to bring the bachelor... Have him come. Your magnificence, Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, give me your hands. Your grace is one of the most famous knights errant there ever was, anywhere on this round earth. Blessings on Cide Hamete Benengeli, who wrote the history of your great deeds. Sit down. So then, is it true that my history exists, and it was composed by a wise Moor? It is so true, Señor, that there are more than 12,000 copies of this history in print. And which deeds of mine are praised the most? On that, there are different opinions. Some prefer the adventure of the windmills, some say that the adventure of the galley slaves is superior to all the rest, another, that none equals that of the two gigantic Benedictines and the dispute with the valiant Basque. Tell me, Señor Bachelor, are the adventures at the inn mentioned? The wise man left nothing in the inkwell. He said everything, even the capering that our good Sancho did in the blanket. And by any chance, does the author promise a second part? Yes, he does, but he says he hasn’t found it and doesn’t know who has it. - Who should have it but me, who writes these feats on the face of the earth! Do you hear Rocinante? This is a very good omen, and I am determined to undertake a sally in 3 or 4 days. And I would like your advice as to the direction I should take on my journey after leaving for Toboso to entrust myself and pay homage to my lady Dulcinea. In my opinion, your grace ought to go to the kingdom of Aragón and the city of Zaragoza, where at the Festival of San Jorge you can win fame vanquishing all the Aragonese knights, which would mean winning it all over the world. That is the plan. But keep it a secret from my housekeeper and niece. O flower of errant chivalry! Let it be today rather than tomorrow that your grace sets out on your way! And if it proves necessary to serve your magnificence as squire, I would consider it a great fortune! Did I not tell you, Sancho, that I would have more than enough squires? And I offer to serve your grace again, as well as and better than all the squires who have ever served knights errant. I will not consent, Sancho my friend, for evil spells to separate us. May God protect your grace. So, three days from now at dusk. You will take the road to Toboso, and keep me informed of your good or bad luck. I promise you. I'll rejoice the former or grieve the latter, in compliance with the laws of friendship. Goodbye, bachelor. God be with you. You're back already? Master and servant are on the way to Toboso. May heaven forgive you for inciting them to this madness again. Listen here. If you were able to devise a story to get Don Quixote out of Sierra Morena, I have thought of something similar to make him return home and never leave again. My proposition is... Night is coming on hurriedly, but lead the way to the palace of Dulcinea. - Perhaps we may find her awake. - What palace am I supposed to lead to, when the place I saw her was only a small house? She must have withdrawn, at that time, to a small apartment in her castle, finding solace alone with her damsels. There? - We have come to the church, Sancho. - I can see that. And may it please God that we don’t come to our graves. Why? It would be better for us to leave the city, and then your grace can wait in some nearby woods, and I'll come back in daylight and search for the house, castle, or palace of my lady. I accept your advice. Now, Sancho my brother, where is your grace going? Are you going to look for some donkey that’s been lost? - No, of course not. - Well, what are you looking for? I’m going to look for a princess - like that was an easy thing to do - who is the sun of beauty and the rest of heaven, too. And where do you think you’ll find all that? Where? In the great city of Toboso. Have you, by chance, ever seen her? Neither I nor my master has ever seen her, but I’ve seen a thousand signs in this master of mine that he’s fit to be tied. It won’t be hard to make him believe that a peasant girl, the first one I run into here, is the lady Dulcinea of Toboso. - If he doesn't believe it? - I'll swear it's true! And if he swears it isn't? I'll insist more, and so no matter what... No matter what...! Señor. Sancho, my friend. Do you bring good news? So good that all your grace has to do is spur Rocinante, and ride into the open to see the lady Dulcinea of Toboso, who is coming to see your grace with two of her damsels. Holy God! What are you saying, Sancho my friend? Do not deceive me! What good would it do me to deceive your grace? Come with me, and you’ll see the princess with her two damsels. They are all shining gold! - Where is she? - You don’t see them riding toward us shining like the sun at midday? I do not see anything except 3 peasants on 3 donkeys. At least it seems that way to me. Don’t speak, Señor and do reverence to the lady of your thoughts, who is almost here. Queen and princess and duchess of beauty, may your high mightiness be pleased to receive into your good graces the knight Don Quixote of La Mancha. I am Sancho Panza, his squire. Out of the way and let us pass; we’re in a hurry! O, sole remedy for this afflicted heart that adoreth thee! The wicked enchanter who pursueth me hath placed clouds over my eyes and for them alone he hath transformed thy peerless beauty and countenance into the figure of a poor peasant, ceaseth not to regard me kindly and lovingly. You can tell that to my grandpa! I just love listening to crackpated things! Step aside and let us pass! Sancho, what do you think of how the enchanters despise me? When I came to help Dulcinea onto her palfrey I smelled an odor of raw garlic that made my head reel and poisoned my soul. Oh, you dogs! Oh, you miserable, evil enchanters, if only I could see you all strung by the gills like sardines. Now I say it again, and shall say it 1,000 more times: I am the most unfortunate of men. My friend, unbridle the horses. I shall do as your grace orders. This spot abounds, it seems to me, with the silence and solitude that I require for my amorous thoughts. Brother Sancho, we have an adventure. - And where is it - Where, Sancho? Turn around and look, and there you will see a knight errant. O most ungrateful and beautiful woman in the world! Casildea of Vandalia. Is it not enough they confessed you to be the most beautiful woman in the world? All the knights of Navarra, all of the Castilians, the Leóneses, and, finally, all the knights of La Mancha? Not so! For I am from La Mancha, and I have never confessed anything so prejudicial to the beauty of my lady - Who is it? Who are you? Do you count yourself among the contented or the afflicted? The afflicted. By any chance, Knight, are you in love? - Unfortunately I am. - It is true, that too much disdain does not confound our reason and understanding. I never was disdained by my lady. If you already know me, afflicted knight, I do not think you need to go into the history of why my destiny led me to fall in love with the peerless Casildea of Vandalia, who has ordered me to have all the knights errant confess that she alone is the greatest beauty of all living, and by whose demand I have conquered many knights. But what gratifies me most and makes me proudest is having conquered in single combat that most famous knight, Don Quixote of La Mancha. and forced him to confess that my Casildea is more beautiful than his Dulcinea! With regard to your grace, Señor Knight, having vanquished knights errant around the world, I say nothing, but your having conquered Don Quixote of La Mancha: that I doubt. - What do you mean? By the heaven above us, I fought with Don Quixote, and I conquered and defeated him. Be calm and listen to me. You should know that Don Quixote has many enchanters who are his enemies. One may have taken on his appearance and allowed himself to be vanquished. Here is Don Quixote of La Mancha himself, who will sustain it with arms, on foot or on horseback! The man who could vanquish you transformed can certainly hope to defeat you in your own person. Let us wait for day. And a condition of our combat must be that the vanquished submits to the will of the victor. I am more than happy with this condition. That’s all right. God’s day will dawn and we’ll be fine. Come quickly, Sancho, and see what magic can do. What wizards and enchanters can do! To be on the safe side, run your sword through who seems to be Sansón Carrasco. Maybe you’ll kill one of your enemies inside him. - That is not bad advice - Stop, señor! Think about what you're doing, Don Quixote, that man lying at your feet is your friend Bachelor Sansón Carrasco - What happened to your nose? - I have it here, in my pocket. Mother of God! Can this be Tomé Cecial, my neighbor and compadre? Of course it is! Come here! Knight, thou art dead if thou dost not confess that the peerless Dulcinea of Toboso is more beauteous than thy Casildea of Vandalia. I confess. Thou must also confess and believe that the knight whom thou hast vanquished was not, nor could he be, Don Quixote of La Mancha I confess everything. Let me get up. If my fall will allow that. Get up. And we, Sancho, will continue on our route to Zaragoza. It seems, Señor Sansón Carrasco, we’ve gotten what we deserved. Who’s crazier? The man who’s crazy because he can’t help it, or the man who chooses to be crazy? He who can’t help it will always be mad. He who chooses can stop whenever he wants to. I chose to be crazy when I decided to become your grace’s squire, and by the same token I want to stop now and go back home. That works for you, but if you think I’ll go back to mine before I’ve given Don Quixote a good beating, then you are sadly mistaken. Run, Sancho my friend, and tell the lady that I, the Knight of the Sorrowful Face, kiss the hands of her great beauty. This isn’t the first time I’ve carried messages to high and mighty ladies! Beautiful lady, That knight over there, called The Knight of the Sorrowful Face, is my master, and I’m his squire, called Sancho Panza. This master of yours, isn’t he the one who has a history published called "The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha?" The very one, Señora. Go and tell your master that he is most welcome at the estates of the duke, my husband. I said I sniffed out a duchess half a league away. I'll go tell my master. Call him. What does he want, señora? Don't you know who just paid me respects through the mouth of his squire? Don Quixote of la Mancha himself, who is coming to kiss my hands. And to amuse us. Wait and see the mockery that we will prepare for them. no later than tonight. Lift the knight up. It grieves me, Señor Knight of the Sorrowful Face, that the first step your grace has taken on my land has turned out so badly. Even if my fall had been to the bottom of the abyss, the glory of having seen you would raise me from it. But fallen or upright, I shall always be in your service and in that of my lady the duchess. Come, Señor Knight, to a castle of mine that is nearby, and there you will be received as so distinguished a personage deserves. By order of our lord the duke! Adorn the castle in all its splendor to receive Don Quixote of La Mancha, who comes with him. He of the Sorrowful Face? The same, who today arrived at our lord's estates. Provide servants. Musicians and jesters. Maidens with flowers. Tell the duke that the knight will not miss out on any of his fantasies. Doña Rodríguez de Grijalba is my name. How can I help you, brother? I would like your grace to go out of the castle gate, where you’ll find a donkey of mine, and be so kind as to take him to the stable. The duennas in this house are not accustomed to duties of that nature. Well I've heard my master say of Lancelot, when he from Britanny came, ladies tended to him, and duennas cared for his steed. Brother, keep your jokes for people who like them. Give us the pleasure of removing your clothing. - For what reason? - To put on a shirt. No! Modesty is as becoming in knights errant as valor. Give the shirt to Sancho, and I will put it on. Honor us, Señor Knight, by taking the head of the table. Dignity would not allow it before so noble a lord. That is not what the language of Fame says. Now tell me, what news do you have of the lady Dulcinea? Señora, my misfortunes, although they had a beginning, will never have an end. Dulcinea has been enchanted, and transformed into the ugliest peasant imaginable. To me she looks like the most beautiful creature in the world. - Have you seen her enchanted, Sancho? - Of course I've seen her! Who the devil else but me first caught on to the enchantment? She’s as enchanted as my father! By any chance are you the Sancho Panza to whom, they say, your master has promised an ínsula? I am. Long life to him and to me. There’ll be no lack of empires for him to rule or ínsulas for me to govern. No, certainly not, Sancho my friend. For I, in the name of Señor Don Quixote, promise you the governorship of a spare one that I own, which is of no small quality. Down on your knees, Sancho, and kiss the feet of His Excellency for the great favor he has done you. Now let's eat. And later we'll stay on the hunt through nightfall. I think I should take my gray to the ínsula, for I've seen more than two jackasses in governorships, and if I take mine, it won’t be anything new. You may well bring the donkey and be a great governor provided that your intentions are honest. Because saying and doing are... That may be, but debts don't distress a good payer, and it’s better to have God’s help than to get up early, and your belly leads your feet, not the other way around. Just put a finger in my mouth and see if I bite or not! God and all his saints curse you, wretched Sancho! Will the day ever come when I see you speak an ordinary coherent sentence without any proverbs? Who are you? Where are you going? And what soldiers are these who seem to be crossing this forest? I am the devil, and I am looking for Don Quixote of La Mancha. If you were the devil, as you say, you would have known Don Quixote of La Mancha, for he is here before you. To you, Knight of the Sorrowful Face, I am sent by the wise Merlin, who brings with him the one they call Dulcinea of Toboso, and he will instruct you on what is needed to disenchant her. Let's get out, my lord Don Quixote, so we can know what the devil commands. I am the wise Lirgandeo! I am the wise Alquife, the great friend of Urganda the Unknown. I am the enchanter Arcalaus, the mortal enemy of Amadís of Gaul and all his kin. I am Merlin, who, the histories say, was sired and fathered by the devil himself. I say to you, wise Don Quixote, that for the peerless lady Dulcinea to regain and recover her first state, your squire, Sancho, needs to give himself 3,000 and 300 blows upon both of his broad buttocks, robust and large. By my soul! What does my backside have to do with enchantments? I shall take you, Don Peasant, you garlic stuffed churl, and I shall give you not 3,000 and 300, but 6,000 and 600, and they will go so deep, they won't come off even if you pull them 3,000 and 300 times! That cannot be, because the lashes must be by his own will and not by force. - Whip myself? I renunce thee! O ill-fated squire, to take notice of 3,000 and 300 lashes, when every boy in catechism, no matter how puny, gets that many every month, horrifies all the natures of those who hear this! - What do you say to that, Sancho? - I renunce the lashes. Well, the truth is, Sancho my friend, if you don’t soften up, you won’t lay hands on the governorship of the ínsula. Since everybody’s telling me to do it, though I can’t see it, I'm happy to give myself 3,000 and 300 lashes on the condition that I can give them whenever I like. Sancho my friend, good Sancho, kind Sancho, sincere Sancho! I must proclaim you the best among all the squires of knights errant! Have you thought about when to start flogging yourself? Leave my good friend Sancho free of care tonight. Leaving the hunt, I gave myself 5 lashes. How did you administer them? With my hand. That is more like slapping than flogging. In spite of this, would Sancho leave his master? If I were a clever man, I would have left days ago, but this is my fate and this is my misfortune. I can’t help it. I have to follow him. We’re from the same village. I’ve eaten his bread. I love him dearly, he’s a grateful man, and more than anything, I’m faithful. And so it’s impossible for anything to separate us, except the man with the pick and shovel. Most high and powerful lord, I am called Trifaldín of the White Beard. I am squire to the Countess Trifaldi, also known as the Dolorous Duenna, who wishes to know if the valiant and never vanquished knight Don Quixote of La Mancha is in your castle, for she has come looking for him. You may tell your lady to come in. The valiant knight you are looking for is here, and from his generous nature she can surely expect every protection. I wouldn’t want this Señora Duenna to put any obstacles in the way of my promised governorship. Dolorous Duenna, arise and speak your piece. Princess Antonomasia is heir to the famous kingdom of Candaya. She was brought up and reared under my teaching. At the age of 14, her beauty caused an impoverished knight at court to fall in love with her. My great ignorance and small foresight opened the way for Don Clavijo, for that is the name of the aforementioned knight and so, I acted as intermediary, and he found himself, not once but often, in the chamber of Antonomasia, who claimed to be her true husband. Señora Trifaldi, your grace should hurry it’s late, and I’m dying to know how this long history ends. Finally the princess decided in favor of Don Clavijo and gave her to him as his legitimate wife, which so troubled Queen Doña Maguncia, that in three days’ time we buried her. - No doubt she must have died. - Of course! As soon as we had covered her with earth when, seated on a wooden horse, there appeared the giant Malambruno, who, to punish Don Clavijo and Anotonomasia, left them all enchanted there on the grave. She was turned into a bronze monkey, and he into a fearsome crocodile of an unknown metal. How awful! "These two daring lovers will not recover their original form," said Malambruno, "until the valiant Manchegan comes to do battle with me in single combat." I see, madam, what I must do, for my spirit is ready to serve you. There's more. He had all the duennas in the palace brought before him, and left us in the condition you will see now. Where can a bearded duenna go? I would pluck mine out if I could not relieve you of yours. Malambruno told me that when fate furnished me with a knight to be our liberator, he would send me a wooden horse, controlled by a peg on its forehead which acts as a harness as he flies through the air. Clavileño the Fleet, he is called. My master can go alone, and good luck to him. Even so, you’ll have to accompany him. Sancho will do what I tell him to do, whether Clavileño comes or whether I face Malambruno. O giant Malambruno, send us the peerless Clavileño, so that our misfortune may end. Let whoever is brave enough climb onto this machine. I won’t, I’m not brave enough and I’m not a knight. Let his squire, if he has one, sit on the hindquarters and trust in the valiant Malambruno. Valiant knight, the horse is here, our beards are growing. Climb on top with your squire and give a joyful beginning to your journey. That I shall do, Señora Countess Trifaldi, willingly. No! That I will not do in any way! What will my insulanos say if their governor goes traveling on the wind? Whenever you return you will find your ínsula where you left it, and your insulanos with the same desire to welcome you. No more, Señor. Let my master climb on, have them cover my eyes, and commend me to God. - May God be your guide, valiant knight! - God go with you, intrepid squire! Now, now you are in the air, moving through it faster than an arrow! Señor, how can they say we’re going so high if they seem to be talking right beside us? Pay no attention to that, Sancho, for since these flights are outside the ordinary course of events, at 1,000 leagues you will see and hear whatever you wish. The matter is proceeding as it should, and we have the wind at our backs. That is true. On this side the wind’s so strong it feels like 100 bellows blowing on me. If we continue to rise in this fashion, we shall soon come to the region of fire, and I do not know how to adjust the peg to keep us from going so high that we are burned. By my soul, we must be in that place of fire already, because I feel like a good part of my beard has been singed! The illustrious knight Don Quixote of La Mancha has concluded the adventure of the Countess Trifaldi, also called the Dolorous Duenna, by simply attempting it. Malambruno considers himself satisfied and content and the chins of the duennas are now smooth and clean, and the sovereigns Don Clavijo and Antonomasia are in their pristine state. My good lord, take heart, for it is all nothing! The adventure is concluded, as the writing on that document demonstrates. Where is the Dolorous Duenna? She is gone - hairless and free of stubble. And how was your long journey? The adventure is finished triumphantly, and it will be good to rest, so that Sancho can march off to his ínsula tomorrow. Sancho, if you govern badly, the fault will be yours and mine the shame. but it consoles me that I did what I had to do and advised you with all the truth and wisdom of which I am capable. Señor, if your grace believes I’m not worthy of this governorship, I’ll let it go. My son, in your governorship, you must fear God, because in fearing Him lies wisdom, and if you are wise, you cannot err in anything. Give me, señor, your blessing, and listen to my doubts. I bless you and I listen. Either the devil will carry me away, or the face of the duke’s steward is the same as the Dolorous One’s. The face of the Dolorous Duenna may be that of the steward, but that does not mean the steward is the Dolorous One. We must pray to Our Lord very sincerely to save ourselves from such wizards. - So it shall be. Goodbye, my son. Keep me informed of everything you discover in this matter, and everything that happens to you in your governorship. Long live the great Governor Sancho Panza, lord of the ínsula Barataria! Why are you sad? Because of Sancho's absence? - It is true, Señora, - That must not be. You will be served by four of my maidens who are as beautiful as flowers, and let Sancho gain fame in his governorship. All that fatness is nothing but a sack of wickedness. God guides him not to turn the whole island upside down. I, Sancho Panza, Governor by graceful appointment of the most serene Lord Duke, owner of the Estates, make it known: It is my will to begin the administration of justice among my governed, who may reach my Authority to exhibit their grievances. So ordained on ínsula Barataria September 15, year of our Lord MDCI. Bring in the next one! Señor Governor, I am a tailor, and this man came to my shop yesterday, and placed a piece of cloth in my hand, and asked: "Is there enough cloth here to make me a pointed cap?" - And he told me there was. - But he thought that I wanted to steal a part of the cloth, and he told me to see if there was enough for two. - And he told me yes. - He kept adding caps, and I kept adding yesses, until we reached five caps. - And now he refuses to pay me. - Is all this true, brother? Yes, Señor, but your grace should have him show you the five caps he made. Gladly. My verdict is the tailor should pay for his labor, and the peasant for his cloth, and the caps should be taken to the prisoners in jail. Bring in the next one! Señor, I’m a poor herder of swine, and yesterday I was selling, you’ll forgive my saying so, four pigs. On the way, I met this... woman, and the devil, who is always cooking up trouble, made us cavort together. I paid her enough, but she caught hold of me and didn’t let go until she brought me here. Lies! The truth, Señor Governor, is that he took me by force! Woe is me, poor orphan! I swear that what I say is the whole truth, down to the last crumb! Let's see, good man. Are you carrying any silver coins? Here I have about twenty ducados in a purse. Give the purse, just as it is, to the plaintiff. God save the life of the governor for watching over unfortunate maidens! Leave. And you. Come closer. Go after that woman, take the purse from her, even if she won't give it and bring it back here. Justice! Thief, let me go! No, no, justice! Justice, God’s justice and the world’s! In the middle of town and in the middle of your court, he tried to take the purse your grace ordered him to give me! - And did he take it from you? - What do you mean, take? I’d let them take my life before the purse. Not this girl! She's right. I confess I don't have the strength to take it from her. My sister, if you had shown the same strength and courage in defending your body as you showed in defending that purse, the strength of Hercules could not have forced you. Go with bad luck, you charlatan and brazen liar! And you take your money, and hold off your desire to cavort with anybody. Send a copy of this sentence and all the others to my lord Don Quixote. Bring in the next one! Listen, your grace, how am I supposed to eat this food? It is customary of other ínsulas where there are governors. - What's with the rod? - I'm a physician and I am chiefly to be present at his suppers and dinners, and allow him to eat what seems appropriate. Why did you remove the dish of fruit? - Because it was too damp. - And the other dish? Because it was too hot and had a good number of spices. That dish of roast partridges won’t do me any harm. The governor will not try them as long as I am alive. - But why? - [In Latin] "A full stomach is bad but full of partridges is very bad." If that’s true, which of the dishes on this table will do me the most good? - Some very thin slices of quince, will settle his stomach and help his digestion. - What is your name? - Doctor Pedro Recio de Agüero, graduate of Osuna. - Well, Señor Pedro Recio de Mal Agüero get out of my sight, and if you don’t, I swear by the sun I’ll take a cudgel, and beat every doctor until there's none left on the ínsula! A courier from the duke, my lord. - Who here is my secretary? - I am, Señor, because I read and write, and because I’m Basque. With that addition you could be secretary to the emperor himself. See what it says! It has come to my attention, Señor Don Sancho Panza, that certain enemies of mine and of the ínsula will launch a furious attack some night; keep watch and stay on guard to not be caught unprepared. I shall come to your aid if you find yourself in difficulty. The Duke. What has to be done now is to put Dr. Recio in jail, because if anyone will kill me, it's him. Give me a piece of bread and 4 lbs of grapes, because they really can’t be poisoned. I'm going to bed! To arms, to arms, Señor Governor! To arms! Infinite enemies have entered the ínsula! We are lost if your valor doesn't aid us! Arm yourself, your lordship, or you and the ínsula will be lost! What do I know about arms or aid? Arm yourself, we have offensive and defensive weapons! Then arm me, and may it be for the best. Wretch that I am, how can I walk when I can't move with these boards sewed up so tight against my body? Now off to the fight! - Over here, men! - Close that gate! - Guard that opening! Oh, if only Our Lord would put an end to the loss of this ínsula! Señor Governor, come enjoy the conquest! The enemy that I’ve conquered I want you to nail to my forehead. Give me a drink of wine and wipe away and dry this sweat, because I’m turning into water. - The joke went too far. - He's practically dead. Come to me, my companion and friend, comrade in all my sufferings and woes. Are you abandoning us, Señor Governor? Señores. I was not born to be a governor, or to defend ínsulas or cities. I know more about plowing and digging. - Now let me leave, it’s getting late. - Do you want something for yourself? A little barley for the donkey and half a loaf of bread and half a cheese for me. Naked I leave. There is no need for another sign to imply that I have governed like an angel. Because your highness wanted it, I governed your ínsula Barataria, which I came into naked, and I’m naked now. I haven’t lost or gained a thing. It weighs on my soul that you've so quickly left the governorship. In that time I learned the burdens that came with it, and the obligations to govern. I kiss the feet of your graces, and return to the service of my lord Don Quixote. Now it seems that it would be good to abandon the extreme idleness which I've had in this castle, and so, I ask permission from your highnesses to leave for Barcelona, since I know that a false historian tells of a Don Quixote who took part in a tourney in Zaragoza. And so the people will see that I am not the Don Quixote he says I am. Count on it, although it weighs on me to see you go. - Steward. - Señor? Give Sancho 200 gold escudos for expenses on the road. - So much water! - Sancho, my friend, this is the ocean. It's larger than the Lakes of Ruidera that I've seen in La Mancha. Such is the prerogative of knight errantry. Even the people of this city know me without ever having seen me. The emissary of the viceroy! His lordship the viceroy, who at this moment is visiting the galleys, aware of the arrival of the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, invites you to accompany him, and to give you a reward. Tell his grace, the viceroy, that I would have it no other way. Halt! Renowned knight Don Quixote of La Mancha! I am the Knight of the White Moon, whose extraordinary deeds have come to your attention! I am here to do battle with you, obliging you to confess that my lady, whoever she may be, is incomparably more beautiful than your Dulcinea of Toboso! - Knight of the White Moon! I should dare to swear that you have never seen the illustrious Dulcinea! If you had, the sight of her would cause you to accept this truth. There has never and can never be a beauty that compares to hers! If I conquer you, I want no other satisfaction than that you abandon your arms and retire to your home for a period of one year, where you must live without laying a hand on your sword. I shall do as you request, but do it quickly! Whomever God favors, may St. Peter bless my master. You are vanquished, knight. And dead, if you do not confess the conditions of our challenge. Dulcinea of Toboso... is the most beautiful woman in the world! And I am the most unfortunate knight on earth. Wield your lance, knight, and take my life, for you have already taken my honor. Let the fame of Señora Dulcinea of Toboso’s beauty live! For the satisfaction I ask is that the great Don Quixote retire to his village for a year, as we agreed before entering into this battle. As long as you ask nothing to the detriment of Dulcinea, I will comply with all the rest like a true and honorable knight. Your word is enough for me. You really don't know who the White Moon is? - It's the first time I've seen him. - Follow him into town, find out who he is and the significance of this stupendous battle. Señor, my name is Bachelor Sansón Carrasco. I am a compatriot of Don Quixote, and because I love him well and pity his madness, I believe his health depends on rest. Some three months ago I took to the road as a knight errant, calling myself the Knight of the Mirrors, I intended to do combat with and defeat him. I planned to ask him to return to his village. - And you fought? - Yes, but he defeated me. Even this couldn't diminish my desire to find and defeat him, to put my intentions into effect. I imagine that all the good bachelor’s efforts will not suffice to restore sanity to a man so hopelessly mad. A year of peace in the village will be a miracle. Since he is so punctilious in complying with the rules of knighthood, he will comply with the one I have given and keep his word. Walk, Sancho, and let us go home to spend the year of our novitiate, after which we shall return to the practice of arms. Señor, traveling on foot is not so pleasant a thing that it moves me to travel a great distance each day. I should like for us to become shepherds, at least for the time I must be retired. I shall buy some sheep, and my name will be Shepherd Quixotiz, and yours Shepherd Pancino, and we shall roam the mountains, singing and lamenting. By God, that sort of life squares so well with me. And Sanchica, my daughter, will bring food up to our flocks. Though there are wicked shepherds, and I wouldn’t want her to go for wool and come back shorn. - My sir, Don Alonso! - What good news, señor Don Quixote! The village rejoices at its most illustrious son, the greatest of all knights errant. - Stop your flattery, I've been defeated in my body and my soul. Now we shall become enamored shepherds. What a discouragement... As per my conditions, I must fulfill One year without grasping my arms. Let's go home, where I can tell you about my misadventures. And in short, the White Moon brought me down, and forced me into a year of retirement at home. - And you intend to obey it? - To the letter. - Is that right? - That's right. I have thought of becoming a shepherd, spending my time in the solitude of the countryside with my amorous thoughts. That seems pleasant. I even volunteer to be a companion in your occupations. I will buy enough sheep and livestock. As for our names, I have thought of some that will fit like a glove. I will be called Shepherd Quixotiz. - And me? - Shepherd Carrascón. And Shepherd Curiambro, your grace. - Sancho will be Shepherd Pancino. - What is this, Uncle? Now you want to go into new labyrinths and become a shepherd? In the countryside will your grace be able to endure the heat of summer, the night air of winter, the howling of the wolves? Be quiet, my dears, for I know what I must do. Take me to my bed, because I think I am not well. Tell Sancho to get a doctor. From thoughts of being defeated or because God wills it, he has a fever. There is no doubt. Attend to the health of his soul, because the health of his body is in peril. Console yourselves and leave me alone, because I want to sleep for a while. By the grace of God, those were not giants, but windmills. And the armies were flocks. The enchanted castle - a solitary inn on the road. The haunted cage was a trick full of good intentions, the same as the Knight of the Mirrors, borne out of the goodness of the Bachelor. Then, it was hired subjects, disguised as the enchanters and the duennas of the procession of The Dolorous One. And Clavileño never flew outside of a dream. Through all of that misfortune, the pain of my defeat remains. Sancho... Good and loyal Sancho. And Dulcinea. An ideal that remains even now that the follies of hopeless madness are removed. Dulcinea... God save you, Mary... The Lord is with you, blessed art thou amongst women. It seems that he remains in a dream. Santa María, Mother of God... Blessed be Almighty God who has done such great good for me! His mercies have no limit. What is your grace saying? - Which mercies are these? - The mercies... are those that God has shown to me. My judgment is restored, free and clear. I recognize the absurdities of the books of chivalry. Blessed be the Lord! I feel, Niece, in the trance of death. I should like to go in a manner that doesn't leave behind a reputation of a madman. Good news... good Señores. I am not Don Quixote of la Mancha, but Alonso Quixano, once called "the Good" because of my virtuous life. Señor don Quixote, when we have news of the disenchantment of Dulcinea, now you say this? Señores... I feel that I am dying... very rapidly. Let us put all jokes aside, and bring me a confessor to hear my confession. For at moments like these, a man cannot play games with his soul. Señor Priest... - Hail Mary, full of grace. - Conceived without sin. He is truly dying. And Alonso Quixano the Good has truly recovered his reason. Sancho... Forgive me, my friend, for the opportunity I gave you to seem as mad as I, making you fall into the error into which I fell. Don’t die, your grace. My Señor, you should take my advice and live for many years, because the greatest madness a man can commit is to let himself die, just like that. That’s right, and our good Sancho Panza knows the truth of these cases. Señores, let us go slowly, for there are no birds today in yesterday’s nests. I was mad... and now I am sane. Your graces, I can, with my repentance and my sincerity, return myself to the esteem you once had for me. Jesus... Jesus... The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha ...And this was not the end, but the beginning. Subtitles by: Flutobias (Karagarga) Based on the translation by Edith Grossman
