NARRATOR: When it comes to competing at the top of the food chain, not all champions are created equal. Sharks have existed for over 400 million years giving them plenty of time to adapt, react and compete. With more than 500 species, all of these apex predators have evolved to win. Welcome to The Game of Sharks. (theme music playing). NARRATOR: We've gathered contenders from around the globe to face off against one another in a ten category competition to crown once and for all our All-Star ocean predator. Whether it's for speed, distance or bite force, the top winners in each category earn points. And when it's all over, the highest score takes all. Will it be the fan favorite the Great White? Or will a unlikely Cinderella story slip in and steal all of the thunder? Now, let the shark games begin! First up, the Ultra Marathon. Or in the watery world, it's the Ultra Migration. Like many animals, shark migrations are often triggered by seasonal change. For some, it's a signal to go in search of a mate and reproduce. For others, it's all about chasing prey. They'll follow an all you can eat buffet just about anywhere. The Salmon Shark prefers to hunt the Northwest Pacific, feasting its way through the Sea of Japan, hooking around to Alaska and down to Baja California, Mexico. Their wide, double keeled tails act as a powerful propellor. With a migration of as many as 11,700 miles, the Salmon Shark is nipping at the heels of this guy. They may look alike, but make no mistake. The Great White is a much bigger shark. And with all that heft, comes a mighty appetite. They are known to swim amazing distances around their territories. Following currents or food sources, like seals and large schools of fish, it's basically the sushi conveyor belt of the sea. In 2004, a shark nicknamed Nicole was tagged off the coast of South Africa. She made her way to Australia and back again in just nine months. An epic trip that lands her species a spot on the score board. Food, while a great motivator, wasn't the reason Nicole competed in this Ultra Marathon. She undertook this race in search of a mate. With an overall mileage count of around 12,400 miles, the Great White takes the lead. For now. Meet the Whale Shark. This whopper of a fish may look slow moving, but don't be fooled. What Whale Sharks lack in speed, they make up for in endurance. Survival depends entirely on filtering tiny dishes like Zooplankton. These floating organisms drift with the currents. And since the currents never stop, neither does the Whale Shark. In 2011, researchers tagged a shark near Coiba Island, then she swam 12,516 miles across the Pacific, from the Galápagos Islands to the Philippines. This grazer may be a lot slower than her competitors, but when it comes to the underwater Ultra Marathon, distance trumps. She gulps her way into the lead by about 100 miles. But there's still another waiting in the wings. The Tiger Shark easily swims its way into the competition. As a predominantly coastal species, Tiger Sharks in the Atlantic usually stick to a loop from the warm Caribbean reefs up to the North Atlantic and back again. In 2012, scientists tracked a male as he left the waters of Bermuda to set out on an incredible 27,000 mile trek. Easily lapping the competition with miles to spare. That dominant performance puts the Tiger in the lead with three points. The Whale Shark floats into second and the Great White scores only one measly point. After all that long distance swimming, it's no surprise sharks can work up a huge appetite. They eat up to 10% of their body weight each week, usually in only one or two meals. Not known for their particularly discerning pallet, sharks often confuse human garbage for exotic delicacies. Once a full suit of armor was found in the gut of a Tiger Shark. While others have been caught with a license plate and even a fur coat in their stomachs. And in 1942, a French fishing crew found a bottle of Madeira wine in a six foot long Blue Shark with particularly refined taste. But this isn't the Iron Stomach Category. It's all about gluttony. And here comes our heavy weight with dinner in sight. Great Whites expend a ton of energy chasing prey, and to keep up their speed and acrobatics, they need to consume the equivalent of a seal pup every three days. Bloody consumption on this scale puts the Great White in position to take the lead in this eating competition. But it's not over yet. Tiger Sharks are equally efficient scavengers making it their business to eat just about everything that crosses their path. Starting when they're young, little Tigers feast on small animals including young birds. Eventually moving on to larger prey like sea turtles and bigger birds, or easy meals like a whale carcass. In the end, it all adds up to an impressive effort. But can they beat this thick fish? What Whale Sharks lack in variety, they more than make up for it with sheer volume. Spending over seven hours a day feeding, Whale Sharks eat up 46 pounds of plankton and shrimp a day. The gentle giant knocks two of the ocean's most feared hunters into second and third place. The Great White will need to come up with a better strategy to recover from back to back losses. In the oceans, it's either eat, or be eaten. So the better your sight, the more likely you are to succeed. The Sharpshooter Competition pits the precision of each sharks senses against another. Because, you never know what could be hot on your tail especially in the murky gloom. Sharks can see ten times better than humans in dark water. They're also stacked with two more senses, a lateral line system and electroreception. Seven total senses, all the better to hunt their prey with. A shark's lateral line system covers its entire body, under the skin, allowing it to feel pressure changes. This helps them sense the movement of prey in the water. And as if that's not enough, sharks also have an organ called the ampullae of Lorenzini. These allow them to sense the electric field produced by their prey: A technique called electroreception. It works especially well when they're up close or trying to find something buried in the sand. While all sharks have a killer arsenal at their disposal, only one can win the title of sharpshooter. ♪ ♪ NARRATOR: Vying for a win, the Blacktip Shark enters the ring. They can be found patrolling tropical waters all around the world. Like their competitors, Blacktips are armed with highly adapted vision, a strong lateral line system, and powerful electroreception. But they have a unique advantage. Their nose. It is so strong that it can smell one part fish flesh diluted in ten billion parts of seawater. Nothing to sniff at. But that alone doesn't guarantee them a win. The Blacktip's sense of smell may be up to snuff, but evolution has given the Great White an edge. 18% of their brain is dedicated to smell. When out hunting, that helps them pick up their prey from a distance. As it moves in on its target it hears it, then it sees it. Then when it is on top of it, it uses electroreception to strike. That superpower could finally give the Great White a win. Or maybe not. Here come the Hammerheads. There are ten species of Hammerhead Sharks around the coasts. Each one guided by eyes spaced so far apart, they have a 360 degree radius. And their overlapping fields of vision gives them a 3D advantage. And that's not all the hammer shape is good for. It supersizes their electroreception bandwidth. Handy when it comes to hunting their favorite food, rays. So when it comes to the super senses needed to win at sharpshooting, the Hammerhead takes all. ♪ ♪ Even apex predators sometimes have to lean on their team mates to get the job done. Some, like the Lemon Shark, have evolved to perfect the art of the relay. When they're pups, they form their own little leagues in the shallow, coastal waters they're born in. As they grow and mature, they stay social and start to hunt in packs. Together, they drive schools of fish, like sardines, into shallow waters where they can feast on them, or go sand fishing by making the water murky so the fish can't see them hunting. This ambush technique works. But it's not good enough to beat team Sand Tiger. Swimming in large packs that can number 100 or more, Sand Tiger's hunt schools of fish, that can't escape. Earning them a point towards a win. But that isn't enough against the Whitetips coordinated offensive effort. They rummage and dig, forcing their prey out and into their open jaws. A technique worthy of two points. But pretty soon, their teamwork falls apart and along with it goes their defense. An opportunistic Grey Reef Shark sees the opening and swoops in to get a taste. ♪ ♪ Other Grey Reef Sharks circle in anticipation. Making their move, they score a hefty catch. It's a clever technique that pushes them into the top spot for winning relay team. With four events down, an unlikely leader has emerged. Closing in on halftime, the Whale and Tiger Shark hold a narrow lead over the fan favorite, the Great White. But, things are about to speed up. Blue Sharks are found in temperate and tropical waters around the world. Up to 13 feet long and weighing in at over 450 pounds. In the cool, deep waters of the ocean, this predator spends its time chasing after prey. Their sleek blue bodies give them a powerful propulsion through the ocean's waters. They've been documented reaching speeds of 43 miles per hour. But the Blue Shark can't take a victory lap yet, there's a challenger coming up on their tail, looking to score its first win. ♪ ♪ NARRATOR: The Great White cruises into position for the speed category. This phenom has a reputation as one of the best in the game for a reason. They've spent more than four million years chasing their prey. Dining on everything from sea birds to fellow sharks, to larger sea mammals motivated to make a quick getaway. Some at up to 25 miles per hour. Catching dinner on the run like that may finally give the Great White a much-needed win. ♪ ♪ But there are no guarantees in this game. Next up, is the Shortfin Mako Shark. Makos look remarkably similar to the Great White. They spend their lives circling the globe in tropical and temperate waters, growing to nearly 15 feet long and weighing more than 1,000 pounds. Named for the Maori word for, "Shark," Shortfin Makos are evolved for speed. Their short fins don't cause drag along their sleek bodies, allowing them to catch the fast food of the sea: Tuna, mackerel, swordfish. ♪ ♪ Reaching speeds up to 45 miles per hour, the Shortfin Mako edges out the Blue Shark. Leaving the Great White, with a good showing of up to 35 miles per hour, still in a disappointing third place. But the Mako's victory may be fleeting as things are about to get rough in the second half. While some sharks aren't built for the great game, they're so cool we had to have a half time show. The Epaulette Shark is the reigning, "Speed walking," champion. These tiny sharks walk through tidal pools and on reef beds to find lunch, by moving their paddle-like pelvic and pectoral fins. Is this the same type of movement the first vertebrates to walk on land used? It's old-school, but it just might be the case. Walking is only half the fight, these incredible competitors put the competition to shame by actually walking on land! Epaulette Sharks can survive for short periods of time out of the sea by selectively routing their blood flow to the places that need it most. A dazzling technique that takes center stage. Whereas these sneaky predators prefer to swim under the radar. If the category is best in camouflage the Wobbegong Sharks are top contenders for the prize. These nine types of, "Carpet Shark," with blotchy coloring blend into the ocean floor, making them the ultimate ambush predator. They can park and wait until just the right moment, and bam! It's game over for you, little fishy. From the tasseled Wobbegong to the ornate Wobbegong, this family of sharks are true showstoppers. And then, there's this strange little shark. The Cookiecutter Shark is so elusive, it's almost never seen alive. But it's circular bite marks can be found on all sorts of creatures. At less than two feet long, these cigar shaped predators take a bite out of life, literally. They lure in prey with glowing photophores on their bellies then attach themselves to their meals with their teeth, cutting out a perfect, "Cookie-cutter," circle of flesh to gnaw on. The Cookiecutter Shark gives a whole new meaning to "Take-out." And now back to the competition! Meant to be lethal, the jaws of a shark are intimidating. Predatory sharks, unlike their filter feeding cousins, can have up to 300 teeth in their mouths. If there was a tooth fairy for fish, they'd be bankrupt by these behemoths. Their triangle shaped daggers have evolved over hundreds of millions of years into feeding tools. Designed to grip and cut, these razor sharp pinnacles pack some serious punch behind them. To stay in the game, you need the gear to match. Great Whites meanwhile have a formidable crushing force of up to 1.8 tons. Going after their prey, they use their jaws to crush and quickly immobilize. A twist on the dine and dash... The slash and dash. This predator needs to quickly stop their prey from swimming away before they eat 'em. The Bull Shark takes a different strategy to put points on the board. Smaller than most Great Whites, Bull Sharks take a gripping bite and hold on. Feeding on smaller fish and smaller sharks, the Bull Shark needs that strong grip to snag their prey. Another repeat contender, the Shortfin Mako. We already know they have the speed, but that's just one part of their prize-winning attack. Their, "Best Bite," game plan? Get in quickly, incapacitate by removing the prey's tail, then ferociously defend their meal. Three different tactic and three different challengers who could take home the win. The average Bull Shark comes in third, with their dogged grip. Our Great White gains two points with their crushing tactics. And the Shortfin Mako claims the category with incapacitation. With four rounds remaining, the challengers must hold on. And the competition is fierce. ♪ ♪ NARRATOR: 20 million years ago the Megalodon ruled the Earth's oceans. Growing to over 50 feet, with a mouth filled with seven inch razor sharp teeth, this OG would crush our next category if they were still around. The Megalodon's smaller cousins now dominate the oceans. And it's time for a competition of the biggest. Great Whites can grow up to a massive 20 feet long, but the average size for this predator is just 15 feet. Way off the Megalodon's 50 feet. Being at the top of the food chain, does helps the Great White measure up against the competition. But that doesn't mean it can stretch to a win. Even Jaws knows when he is out matched. Passive giants in their underwater territories, Basking Sharks have less of a reputation than Great Whites. But what the Basking Shark lacks in fear factor, it makes up for in sheer size. Weighing in at over five tons and mind boggling lengths of up to 40 feet. This filter feeder is unique among sharks in that it doesn't actively suck in water to feed, but instead creates a constant flow, straining up to 2,000 tons of water an hour. Impressive, but there's still a third contender. The Whale Shark. Not only can they grow 50% longer, he's in a weight class all of his own. Once again, it's the grazer who comes in from behind to win biggest shark. Weighing in at 15 tons, the weight of two elephants. This big 'ol filter feeder is fast becoming the darling of warm waters around the world. ♪ ♪ Now, the high jump. Whipping out of the water, sharks can launch themselves into the air for brief flights of fancy. Defying their watery worlds and gravity. Trim and sleek sharks that reach for a high vertical clearance all have a burst of speed and are shaped like torpedos. Well almost all. The Basking Shark, the second largest shark in the oceans, has been recorded launching itself out of the water with a less graceful form than some. Understandable, given that they can weigh up to 10,000 pounds. Some scientists speculate that they do it to rid themselves of external parasites. But as you can imagine getting nearly four feet out of the water does not land them in the top three. ♪ ♪ NARRATOR: To win the high jump our competitors must have maximum vertical effort. Spinner Sharks propel themselves through bait balls of fish, like sardines or herring, spinning as they launch themselves out of the water biting away at their food. And reaching heights of up to 20 feet. These migratory sharks live in subtropical waters around the world, chasing schools of fish up and down coast lines. This jumper is a Shortfin Mako. They may not spin, but when it's time to get some air, boy do they ever. They'll do it to clear themselves of being hooked on fishing lines and to ambush prey. Either way, these fish know how to put on a show, whipping their bodies from side to side, the highest jump recorded for a Mako is more than double its length at 30 feet. But not to be shown up, the Thresher Shark thrashes its way into the competition. These sharks grow up to 20 feet long, and almost half of that can be their unique tail fin. They use it to smack and stun their prey. ♪ ♪ It's been said that they can jump up to 20 feet and when they do, the Thresher's technique is flawless. And yet, when it comes to style their sleek outline has nothing on this camera darling. Once again, the Great White Shark makes a splash. The Great White's go to maneuver is all about stealth. They detect surface prey from the safety of the depth. And then, they kick it into gear. Rocketing upwards at up to 40 miles per hour. Bulls eye. Current world record? An estimated 15 feet. But again, it isn't enough. So when it comes to the high jump, here's how it stacks up. Vaulting themselves up to 30 feet out of the water, the Shortfin Mako jumps fins and tails to their third victory. In this category, sharks compete on the senior tour, where it pays to be old. Recently crowned largest fish, the Whale Shark is easily identifiable by the unique patterns across their back. In Madagascar, Whale Sharks are called Marokintana, which means, "Many stars." Scientists have used radiocarbon dating to estimate just how old some of them are. Then there's this prehistoric looking shark which hails from a species as ancient as it looks. One way to tell a Greenland Shark's age is by examining the isotopes in their eyes. A Greenland Shark tagged and measured back in 1936, was measured again in 1952. Its slow growth suggested that they only grow less than half an inch a year. Impressive for a shark that can grow more than 13 feet long, which can add up to over 300 years. That's ten feet longer than their other spotted competitor, the Spiny Dogfish. Named for the way they hunt in packs, and the venomous, defensive spines on their dorsal fins. The Pacific Spiny Dogfish can live more than 80 years. These tiny but mighty sharks need all the help and longevity they can get to land a win against the Great White. ♪ ♪ NARRATOR: All right, so we're this deep into the competition and the Great White has yet to secure the number one spot on the leaderboard. Born after a 14 month gestation period, they grow up to nine inches a year. Their age is known by counting rings on their vertebrae. Great Whites have nearly human lifespans. The infamous Deep Blue is estimated to be 50 years old. Some Great White Sharks have been dated to being 73 years old, making them among the oldest living fish. But that still isn't old enough to land a spot in the top three. It's estimated Whale Sharks live to around 100 years. And radiocarbon dating of Greenland Sharks place the oldest of the species at more than 500 years old, making it the oldest known competitor in the game. Take that, Tom Brady. Just one category remains and the Great White is swimming in third. It will need true brawn to muscle out a win against the Whale Shark and Shortfin Mako. And now, it's time for the final round, where sharks face off once again in a category measuring their appetite. Only this time, they're scored on their frenzied technique. In order to sneak up on their prey, sharks rely on strong senses, adaptive coloring and predatory instincts. Sharks that trigger feeding frenzies, A.K.A. all you can eat buffets, often consume their food in a trance like state. The frenzies of Whitetip Sharks are seen as opportunistic. Sometimes following fishing boats, these sharks can get aggressive with one another as they compete for the trapped fish and an easy meal. But these feedings are nothing compared the Copper Sharks off the coast of South Africa. In June and July, millions of sardines move up around the eastern coast towards a seasonal cold spot. These shimmery schools are targets for deep sea predators, including the Copper Shark. Also known as Bronze Whalers, these sharks can grow up to about nine and a half feet in length. A cousin to our high jumper, the Spinner Shark, the Copper Shark is named for its coloring. As they bob and weave through the silver balls of sardines, they voraciously feed, consuming as much of the fish as possible before moving on. As the Copper and Whitetips work for their small prey, others scout out the occasional binge worthy bounty. When whales die, they become large feeding opportunities for shrewd sharks. And Great Whites are especially shrewd. Just like the old saying goes, one whale's carcass is another shark's treasure. Tracking whale carcasses, scientists are able to observe as the same sharks come back again and again and gorge themselves on the fatty whale flesh, often eating themselves into a seemingly intoxicated state. It's those big bites and never ending appetites that finally pushes the Great White over the top. Snatching a win from the jaws of defeat at the buzzer, the Great White swims ahead of the Whale Shark and the Shortfin Mako to a definitive victory. These sharks came to compete. There can only be one top shark! And the Great White showed the competition why it deserves to be ranked number one. ♪ ♪
