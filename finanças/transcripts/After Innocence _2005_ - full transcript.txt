Hallelujah! Praise God! [ Applause ] [ Man ] The exonerees-- they're the greatest human resource... our criminal justice system has had ever, because what we can learn from them and their cases... can help us create a more just society... and fix the system and move it forward in a way... that it hasn't been within memory. It, like, breaks your soul down. It breaks everything down about you. It takes your manhood. It takes your pride. It takes your decency, your respect, because you're actually nothin'. All you are is something locked in a cage back and forth every day. Being a police officer, I cooperated... because I thought the state police investigators... would handle the investigation the way I would've. When I used to read people their rights, one of the first things I would say to them... after they waived their rights and they agreed to speak was, "If you didn't do this crime, I don't want you to admit to it." It's finally over. It's been 19 years. What now? Go home. [ Man ] 99.99% of defendants never say anything. And he stood up, and his words as I best remember them: "Judge, I just wanna tell you, the administration of justice in Massachusetts... is a crock of shit." Those are the words I remember him saying. [ Man ] It was the most emotional moment I've ever had in my career. I told Mr. Maher how sorry I was... that I had been involved in his prosecution, and I asked him to forgive me. [ Woman ] All right! [ Applause ] [ Man ] It's breathtaking to be sittin' up here today, 'cause I came out of Michigan. That was one of the 12 states that doesn't have the death penalty. And, uh, I think all those years, I was just sittin' there thinkin' of what it would've been like... had Michigan had the death penalty. And I'm thoroughly convinced that I would've been executed about 1995 or 1996, okay? I'm really honored to be here today with all these gentlemen here... who were wrongfully incarcerated. I know it looks like a lot of people here, but really it's not, because in actuality, all our family... should be up here with us because they all suffered. For every one of us up here, there is hundreds more in prison that don't belong there. There's so many of them... that aren't gonna see the streets again. They're not gonna be with their friends and family... because the DNA evidence was lost or destroyed, or because there's no DNA evidence to test. [ Scheck ] The one thing that is so unique about all of you... is that you all come with the determination... that all that pain must've had a purpose. There is a reason that you made it, and you're gonna find... that it doesn't matter who you are-- whether you were a police officer or a United States marine... or a Sears Roebuck salesman. It can happen to anybody, and it did. [ Neufeld ] You folks were responsible for literally transforming... criminal justice in this country. I can look around the room and know what reform occurred in that state... as a result of your false confession or your misidentification... or the junk science that was used to convict you. But after those 30 minutes of fame, the press walked away, and you guys were left holding the bag. We didn't think about what happens to you after you're exonerated. To the extent that you can see another comrade who hasn't faired quite as well as you, please reach out to them and communicate. It's probably the best thing that we can do this weekend. Everyone who's doing computer training, we're going into the big conference room to start off there. Uh, Jim Bromgard. I got an e-mail. I get on the Internet three, four times a week and play around in there. So I got a little bit of experience. [ Laughter ] Okay, everybody say "freedom." [ All ] Freedom! [ Bongos ] Let me play with you. [ Indistinct ] [ Vincent ] Every time I go for a job, it says, "In the last 10 years, have you ever been convicted of a crime?" It doesn't say, "Have you ever been wrongfully accused of a crime?" So my record not being expunged, yes, that damages me... for trying to get my life back in order and gettin' a good job. Hey! [ Laughs ] Where you comin' from? Huh? [ Woman ] Vincent's a very good father. And now he has his baby daughter, and so he's trying to put everything he has... or everything he lost into that child, and he's doing his best. [ Giggling ] That's right. [ Vincent ] You can't be a father in prison. You can be what is called a "dad." My definition of a dad... is one that brags and boasts about his kids. But a father is one that's there and supports and gives. What could I give? I had nothin'. How could I support 'em? I'm never there. I'm not home. [ Jackie ] People didn't know that he's out because he's innocent. People just know he's out. And as far as they know, he could be a rapist. It's 10 years later. Mom and Dad wanted to move to another state. He refused. And he went on his own personal campaign to prove, "Here I am. I'm innocent." And that's when I could tell that psychologically, something had happened to him. He needed a place to live. My parents gave him the home that he's in now, and they moved to North Carolina. Everybody brings their laundry here. My sisters, my cousins, my nieces. "Oh, you got a washer and dryer. That's a nice one." That's what they say. So-- The only thing I require from them... is they bring their own soap powder. Later on I tell 'em I'll pay for the electric, the water and the washing machine, but you gotta bring your own soap powder. It was hard for my father to explain to me, "I got convicted of raping somebody, but Daddy didn't do it." So I was, like, "How you not do it if you've been here all these years now?" "This is, um, no disrespect to you, but my friend, she said that you raped her." And I said, "Well, who's your friend?" And he said, "The girl standin' right there on the corner." So I turn around and look. I said, "Well, she just spoke to me." And he says, "Well, um, she's goin' to get the cops, because she said you raped her." So I told him, "Well, look, I'll wait here with you... until she comes back with the cops so we can straighten this out now." And all I could do was try to convince this person that-- "Miss, look at me real good. You're makin' a mistake. You got the wrong guy. I don't even know you." And I know when they told me rape, robbery, possession of instrument at crime, a gun, conspiracy, and all these-- I'm, like, my God! You know, this is almost like... a hundred years in jail for somethin' you didn't do, and I'm really scared. You went to the best schools, lived in a really nice neighborhood. Your father worked to pay for five kids to go through Catholic school. Every Sunday, you had pancakes, and everything in life is wonderful. And then one day, somebody comes up and tells a lie on you, and you end up in jail. What's different is he knows fear doesn't exist. [ Chattering, Indistinct ] It is good. [ Child ] I want lasagna. You want lasagna. For the children. And that's it. Yeah? Have a seat. We'll be right with you, okay? Okay. Dear Lord, please bless this food to nourish our bodies and keep us in good health. Please bless those who are not fortunate enough to have a meal quite as this. Amen. [ All ] Amen. When he told me that he was wrongfully incarcerated... for ten and a half years, I was in shock. And all that time he lost from his family, and-- We kept gettin' closer and closer together. Yeah. He wasn't sleepin'. He'd be up all night playin' sad music. Beautiful music, but it was always sad. It wasn't, like, happy music. And then it seemed like every turn I made, it was like a wall there. The woman sayin' that I raped her-- Like, in my mind-- in my mind, I couldn't trust women anymore. It got to the point where-- "Leave me alone. Go sleep in the other room." And stuff like that. And you can't do certain things. It's like not bein' able to be a man, you know, when you're not financially stable. So much is goin' wrong, you're not established career-wise. You took the prime years of my life. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25-- These are the years where you actually establish yourself in your career. I said, "You took those years from me." They didn't compensate me or anything. They didn't give me anything. They told him, "Okay, you know what? We made a mistake. See you later." "We made a mistake. You can go home." That's it. "We made a mistake. See you later. Have a good life." Heard you just got off of death row. Congratulations, buddy. Yeah, 'cause your case, uh-- Was your case the first case in the history of Pennsylvania to get off of death row? Right. And my case was the first case in the history of Pennsylvania... to be the first one to use DNA. They never expunged my record. They told me they wanted $6,000 to expunge my record. All kinds of crazy things, you know? Okay, great. All right, buddy. All right. [ Clears Throat ] That was Nick Yarris. Yeah. He told me he did 26 years... [ Sighs ] on death row. He's on his way here. When I first requested DNA in 1987, who would've thought right now that, you know, everyone is usin' it now freely, man? 'Cause I fought hard to get that. Ten and a half years. If it had not came back-- They found four different sperms in this woman... who was supposed to be a married, you know, upstanding citizen. And they found four different sperms in her, and none of 'em were mine. That's incredible. I was in prison, down in the music department. And a guy called down. He was, like, "Turn the Phil Donahue Show on! Turn the Phil Donahue Show on! They're talkin' about DNA." How come they're out? How come these men are free? Because DNA testing proved that they didn't do it. They didn't do it. And are you here to say that these young men are the tip of the iceberg? Now, through DNA, we have hard evidence... that there is a lot more mistakes being made than we ever expected. That means that there are thousands of people in jail today... who can prove their innocence with DNA tests just as these gentlemen did. After having featured Barry Scheck on our program, the mail started. [ Vincent ] I wrote him a five-page letter, and I said, "I was watching your show. I'm sittin' in prison, and I didn't commit this crime I was accused of, of rape." [ Donahue ] We were very conscientious about reviewing-- vetting these letters. I recall the audience being very, very shocked to learn... that the system didn't work. It's not possible to overstate how much confidence we have. By God, when they go to jail, they deserve to go to jail. [ Vincent ] He told me that he had forwarded my letter... to Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, and that they would take my case. Vincent? Yes. Nick. Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you, sir. Congratulations. Congratulations to you. How are you? I'm fine. On the third, I'm gonna go and enact legislation... called the Nick Yarris bill... for compensation. Right. Now that a death penalty case was shown through DNA testing, they're gonna be a little bit more receptive. Right. Hopefully. Yeah, hopefully. Come on. I was convicted and sentenced to die... for murder and rape in 1982, and I spent 23 years on death row in solitary confinement. And I was just released 32 days ago. I grew up in that house right there for the first seven years of my life. Some of my fondest childhood memories... are right underneath that green awning. And now I walk by, and I'm, uh, Ebenezer, walking around a ghost in my own life. No, man. Could you imagine being accused... of the worst thing you could imagine, be sent to a prison up in Huntington, Pennsylvania... that was condemned by the United Nations... for its practices of torture, and then be told, "You're not allowed to speak"? That's true. For the first two years, I wasn't allowed to talk. I remember when I first got out of prison... how loud the world was. I mean, oh, my God! I would hear the tires on the cars in the street-- I wouldn't hear the engines and the horn. I would hear the tires, it would be so loud. And I was amazed by the smell of what the world was, because I had been breathing refiltered air for twenty-some years. That was-- It's strange. I suffered-- My sinuses and my face was killing me, because I was allergic to fresh air. It was hurting me to breathe. Strange. You know when someone says something to you, and they say, "You know, you're wrong," and you know the truth, and then it gives you that incredible sense of peace? Because whatever they said, it doesn't matter. That was my greatest strength. They could do whatever they wanted to me. I'm one of the strongest human beings ever created. I know that now. And I say that without an ounce of ego, because I've paid for it. The one vehicle that you can dive where you're actually outside, because I don't think I wanna be on the inside a whole lot for a while. I was inside for a really long time. So I think I'll just enjoy being outside. [ Man ] Jeffery! [ Chattering ] Friends amongst you. Oh, God. Don't start. Youngster. How you doing, Luke? [ Nick ] Everybody on death row knows that there's a limited number of groups... that try to use their voices on the outside... to bring dignity or hope to these men who are in hopeless situations. Jeff is well hated and well loved in most of the prisons. An equal value to each, I'm glad to say. And most of the hate is from the administration... who can't stand him because he's such a pain in the ass, which is one of the reasons I like him. It's always good to go from writing letters to somebody inside prison... to having them in your office, even when they're harassing you. I'm gonna break the death penalty. I decided to do that out of spite. I can't live in peace. I can't walk away, because I looked in people's eyes and promised them I would come back and fight for 'em. Everyone here like Jeff, they chose to do this. That's why they have my respect. This isn't something that was dropped on them. They decided to step up for it because it's the right thing to do. I don't have a choice. I'm no hero at all. I was kind of angry. I told the judge to go to hell. I looked him right in the face and I said, "You and I both know I didn't kill anyone." And he couldn't look me in the eye. It was like it was his humiliation... that he kept putting his head down. So I said, "Look at me. You can't even look me in the eye, and you're about to sentence me to die." And he said, "Are you finished?" I said, "No. You can go to hell." I wasn't gonna go in there with my head hung in shame. I hadn't done anything. I had to fight despite lawyers, despite prosecutors who tried to destroy evidence. I had to fight despite things in prison... you could never wanna know. If I was guilty and was released on parole, I would be entitled to health care, job training, placement in society, housing, health care-- all those things that people on parole are entitled to... as part of the program services that enable them... to get back on their feet and get their lives together. I was given $5.37 by the state of Pennsylvania and let loose. The day I got out, we all went home. There was everyone there that I missed, and I said simply, "There are two things that I know-- family is everything, and family is everything." And that's it. [ Man ] "October 17, 1994. "Dear Mr. Neufeld, My name is Wilton Dedge, "and I am very interested in the organization the Innocence Project. "I don't know where else to turn. "I've tried everything I could to prove my innocence when all this first started. "When I found out that the police were looking for me, "I turned myself in knowing that it was all a mistake and that it would be straightened out. "I could write a number of pages telling you... "how outlandish the case is, but I know that you are very busy, "so I'll close for now. "I thank you in advance for your time and any help you can give. Sincerely, Wilton Dedge." I was locked up when I was 20 years old-- just turned 20 years old. And I'm 42 now, so I've been in a little over 22 years. Convicted for rape and sentenced to two life sentences. I really don't understand how I was even brought to court, much less convicted. [ Man ] According to the description the girl gave, her assailant was over six-foot tall, 180 to 200 pounds, long blond hair and a receding hairline, which the only thing that matches him is long blond hair. Anyone that's had children, you've got a gut feelin' whether they're tellin' you the truth or tellin' you a lie. And whichever way it is, it usually comes out... the way your gut feelin' was. And my gut feeling has always been... that Wilton was tellin' me the truth about this. There's just no way I can believe he's guilty of what he's been accused of. [ Man ] About six and a half years ago, Barry Scheck called... and he said that they had three cases in Florida, and would I be willing to do them. And he would positively guarantee that I would never get paid... and, in fact, that it would cost me money to do this, but that if I did a good job, he would send me more cases where I wouldn't get paid and it would cost me money to do it. So how do you turn down an offer like that? [ Wilton ] They had two hairs and a semen sample from the scene. The first test-- the semen sample-- was inconclusive. So we had the two hairs found that they used against me in trial... and had the DNA testing done on it. And it proved beyond a doubt that it wasn't mine. Judge Silvernail granted the admittance of DNA testing... and said that had I had it, I probably would've been acquitted. And the district attorney filed an appeal... trying to get the judge's decision overturned, saying that even though it proves it's not mine, that I didn't file properly. The presiding judge of that court... asked the assistant attorney general, "I wanna make sure I understand your position. "If this man is entirely innocent, is it still your position that he's entitled to no relief at all?" And she said, "Yes, that's our position." And his jaw fell open. Basically, I proved my innocence-- innocence too soon is what they're sayin'. Wilton Dedge is the case that poses the question, "Does innocence matter in Florida?" You have to go back to the days of Jim Crow... to find an instance where the state of Florida... has been as cruel... as it has been in the case of a man... who has been demonstrably innocent for three years-- never mind incarcerated for 22, demonstrably innocent for three-- and is still behind bars. [ Scheck ] They wouldn't give us access to the evidence. They wouldn't permit the DNA testing. Even when we got DNA testing that was exculpatory of Dedge, they didn't want the judges to look at it. They didn't care whether he was innocent. They were more interested in covering themselves... against the possibility they made a grievous mistake. The so-called "finality of the system"... was more important than getting an innocent person out of jail... and finding the person who really committed the crime. [ Wilton ] The Innocence Project wrote me back asking for a little more information. Once they read through the records, they couldn't believe I was convicted. And they've been supportive the whole time. [ Neufeld ] Welcome. It's really great that you're all here. We started out as a small clinic at a law school... trying to free people who made a claim of actual innocence. And we started with a trickle of clients. Now, we see it's snowballed into something... where we now have a couple thousand people moving through the system here, more than a hundred active cases, a network of 30 Innocence Projects around the country, and as much concern with policy and reforming criminal justice... to make it more scientific, more reliable, more about the truth-seeking function. In most of our cases, the critical biological evidence... has either been lost or destroyed. But, more importantly, 90% of the cases don't even involve biological evidence. And what it tells us is that there are obviously... tens of thousands of innocent people... currently languishing in prison in the United States. And so, the Innocence Project is in a race against time... trying to help these people, and a lot of what you're gonna be doing is running that race. I'm going through letters, opening them up, reading through to make sure they're not death row... so we can put the death row ones at the top of the pile. And I do them into the computer-- their names, their addresses. Then we give 'em to the bosses, and they look through them and keep going through the piles... and sending out letters and deciding what to do with the cases. So we do pro bono legal work. There's only a few staff attorneys and regular workers... that are paid and do this full time. So to get through all the letters, we have to have people like me-- undergrads-- doing intake. [ Woman ] All of these drawers... which are just literally... full of cases, letters that haven't been opened. Hundreds and thousands of letters. [ Male Electronic Voice ] I have a collect call from-- [ Wilton ] Inmate Dedge. an inmate at Cross City Correctional Institute. To accept, dial or say "five." [ Presses Button ] Your call is being connected. [ Wilton ] Nina Morrison's been real great. She's been callin' me here about once a week. Basically, keepin' my spirits up. Hey, Wilton, how you doin'? Warm. Warm. Yes, I can imagine. Has the mercury hit 90 yet? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's been that for a few days now. Oh. You hangin' in all right? Yeah. You know, it's true, and I think it's hard, 'cause those of us who are on the outside forget. You know, this to us feels like the time when things are really moving. But I know that the days seem a lot slower and longer in there. [ Wilton ] The same district attorney that convicted me in '84, he seems to be tryin' everything he can to keep me from goin' back to court. That's the composite that the victim did, and she explains what she saw of the defendant, how he looked, etcetera, and-- "Yeah, that's it. That's the hairline. That's the way the hair was. You know, that's the nose and the eyes, etcetera." And that is the way the defendant looked at the time. I mean, you ask the victim to do an identification, and that's about as good as it gets. [ Man ] Through the evolution of DNA technology, we can reveal a genetic signature... that is unique in the human population... based upon demonstrable proof. Having revealed that somebody is falsely convicted... and frequently having to fight a battle... to even do the investigations... is not a sign that the system is working properly. That's a sign that the system's not working. [ Man ] The only thing that's occurred up to this point in time is... the gate has been opened so that this may be considered... in an evidence hearing, the defendant has the burden of proof. [ Silvernail ] It's not your intent to challenge DNA... in terms of the scientific predicate, per se. [ Holmes ] My challenge is as to all the DNA testing that's been done... and what significance it should play in the court's decision. I'm wondering if the state would mind providing us... with the names and titles of the possible witnesses you may need to call. [ Holmes ] It's a little late to be playing the discovery game. [ Hirsch ] Your Honor, I don't quite know... what Mr. Holmes means by "playing the discovery game." We're gonna produce the DNA evidence and what we have to do to get it before the court. That's our case. It just turns out that Dennis, our 127th exoneree from Massachusetts, was coming into town today-- For her birthday. For my birthday. So we thought, wow, what a better lunchtime treat... than to have-- to hear a real exoneree tell his story. And he is doing way, way better than a lot of our other guys. And he'll tell you the rest. Dennis. In November of 1983, I was arrested and charged with attempted rape, rape, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and assorted other charges. I was sentenced to 20 to 30 years and second degree life. And so I expected to never get out of prison. And then in 1993, I saw on Phil Donahue Barry Scheck... had just started the Innocence Project in New York. So I wrote Barry a letter and asked him for help. Now, I went, like, 16 years without a lawyer. I did all of this work by myself. And then, I had a lawyer. So as you can imagine, it was a very emotional time. [ Man ] Is there anything else that I have to do... other than sign the motion to vacate-- to have him released from the courtroom? [ Woman ] No, Your Honor. Well, I've allowed the motion. I'm signing it. And it shall be filed. Is there anything else? [ Woman ] Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. The defendant is expulsed. [ Applause ] [ Dennis ] She's my hero. Without her, I'd still be in prison. She fought for my case. She fought for me. She believed in me. You know, how can you say thank you for what she did? There is no way. [ Man ] Come forward. Come forward. Come forward. Come forward. Dennis is just gonna make maybe one statement here. And then, as you all know, there's a larger press conference at 12:00. [ Man ] Dennis, how are you? How are you feeling, Dennis? I have no comments right now. [ Laughter ] It's all a little overwhelming. [ Chattering ] J. Carney wanted to talk to you. Yeah, I'll talk to him. [ Dennis ] As I was leaving, the senior court officer says, "J.W. Carney--" the D.A. who prosecuted me-- "he would like to talk to you." And he apologized. And it was, um, a true apology. You know, it was really heartfelt. So I got my apology. That felt good. Comin' out. Back up. Watch out. [ Camera Shutters Clicking ] We were all happy. We all had tears in our eyes, 'cause we knew now that he was comin' home. And when he come home-- Oh, my goodness. [ Chuckling ] That was a cryin' day. Makes me feel like a new man, like when he was a kid. That's what it makes me feel like. [ Dennis ] My parents were livin' alone. I moved back in with 'em. This used to be their entertainment room. Well, now I live in here. And they say, "When you go away, it's quiet. We like it when you're here. 'Cause even if you're not talkin' to us, you're still makin' noise." So it had a good effect on them. [ Man On P.A., Indistinct ] Come on, Sarah. Get out there. Come on, Sarah! [ Laughing ] [ Man On P.A. Continues ] He came in last. He came in last. Right there. No good. Now I'm just about even. [ Dennis ] You won last week. I won two bucks. Better than nothin'. When he was in jail, I lost interest in everything... just on account of that. 'Cause when he got arrested, I almost got arrested myself with him. I was ready to start fightin' with the cops. Last race, then we go home. [ Dennis ] Today's my birthday. It's my first birthday out of prison. So I can do what I want. If I don't wanna do nothin', I don't have to do nothin'. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Dennis Happy birthday to you Blow out the candles. Make a wish. [ Cheering ] Yea! This is the sweatshirt and the jacket I had on when I got arrested. I planned on doin' 20 years in the military, and then startin' a second career as a mechanic. You know, that was when my hopes in a day got shattered. I bought a six-pack in the Lowell Package Store. Walked down here and got arrested right in front of the soap-washed windows. And I had a half an ounce of marijuana in my pocket, and he arrested me for possession. And that's where it started from. He seen me in a red-hooded sweatshirt from across the-- two streets. And I was the one, and he was gonna take me down. I thought I was arrested for possession of marijuana. Then they told me about rape. So I says, "Well, I didn't do 'em, and I think I need a lawyer." They were week-long trials. Most of it was just the victim sayin', "He did it." It felt bad because... I could see the pain that the women were in. And... I know I didn't do it, and they were sayin' I did. I had never seen these women before. My lawyer was the worst lawyer on the planet. The only time I saw him was at court. He never visited the scene of the crime. He was horrifying. I wanted to get rid of him, but I didn't know how to. I'd never been to court. I was in shock, because I got found guilty. And then he sentenced me to all that time, and I didn't know what to expect in prison. You know, I expected bein' beaten, bein' raped. I expected to die in prison. [ Woman ] I met Dennis at the treatment center at Bridgewater. He was committed there after he was found too dangerous. Everybody there is doing therapy. It's not your, um-- I guess your typical prison environment. Usually, in the beginning of treatment, the men will come in claiming they're innocent. But over time, they work through that denial. [ Dennis ] I became one of the prizes in the treatment center. If you could get Dennis to admit to his crimes, you were accomplishing something. Um, I used to tell the therapists-- I said, "Listen, I didn't do the crimes. "I know it's your job to get me to admit to it. It'll never happen. "I'll do what therapy I can do, but it'll be nothing on the crimes." I was a pretty angry person in prison. I would go to work in the mornings, and the guys would say, "Uh-oh. Who pissed him off?" And I'd tell 'em, "You do 18 or 19 years in prison when you're innocent, and see if you don't have a lot of bad days." [ Dizio ] Whether it be an anger management or a stress management class, I think having those therapeutic outlets... really helped both maintain him and also continue his drive. [ Dennis ] It helped me not to become institutionalized. If I was institutionalized, I couldn't do anything when I got out. I have a job now, I have my driver's license, and I function as close to normal as I can. [ Man ] He must've felt everybody was against him in prison. [ Chattering ] I mean, everybody else is lookin' at you like, "You did it. You did it." Then finally, you get redeemed. That must've been nice. Or were you angry? I don't know. He ain't got no grudge against nothin'. That's why I know he's that way-- an innocent man and a good man. I'm, like, "You gotta be shittin' me. After that long?" Oh! It shocked me. Really, it did. How can you be in jail that long and not be angry or not be upset, you know? He just said he wasn't, so he's a better man than I am for that. My name's Jeffery Scott Hornoff, and I'm a police officer. I was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Every step of the judicial system failed me and my family. And if not for the guilt and remorse of the true killer, I'd still be in prison. [ Man ] This guy, Scott Hornoff, was in jail. [ Continues, Indistinct ] [ Scott ] My oldest son was about six and a half. I always saw myself gettin' down on bended knee... and him jumpin' in my arms when I was freed. Now he's 14. He's six-foot tall, 245 pounds. He was in the courtroom when I was freed, and he picked me up. [ Applause ] He's free. Free. Oh, honey. Now you can live again. I love you. I doubt if even Shakespeare could find the words... to express adequately how I'm feelin' right now. I thank God and I thank my family... and my friends, both old and new, for supporting me and fighting for me... and never giving up on me, even in the darkest times when I thought of giving up myself. My thoughts go out to the thousands of other innocent people... still wrongfully imprisoned across the United States, and the thousands more facing unjust and unfair prison sentences. And I hope to help change that. This was my first beat right here. This is considered post seven in Warwick. Being a police officer and being questioned for a murder... was, uh, an undescribable feeling. I had decided to become a police officer at the age of 12, and I pretty much devoted my life to it. And to have the whole judicial system turn around and target me... was really hard to take. I was unfaithful to my ex-wife. Vicki and I were intimate twice. I feared I would be questioned because of my brief relationship with her, but I never realized I would be questioned as a suspect. It was just ridiculous how the Warwick police... handled the investigation from the very beginning. They trampled underneath where Todd Barry climbed up. They walked all over there, where they could've gotten some footprints. And there were scuff marks goin' up, and they didn't do anything with those. There was no apology from the judge, the prosecutor, the attorney general. Actually, I think they were upset at me for being innocent. This is the Warwick Police Department. It's where I was welcomed into detectives, and then questioned about Vicki's murder. [ Man ] I don't think you ever enjoyed the presumption of innocence. The only thing that you did wrong was have this affair with the girl. And suddenly, the spotlight's on you. There is still the idea that if you've been arrested, you did somethin'. But here, he must've done somethin' really bad, because he's a policeman and the police arrested him. Okay? And that-- that was somethin' you were never, ever going to get over. Did you ever go down and get your badge and I.D. after you got reinstated? That's part of tomorrow's discussion. Oh. So what my attorney is sayin' is, "Okay, fine. "You tell us what 10 years of back pay... "and six and a half years of wrongful imprisonment... "and the loss of Scott's home and the loss of his mom's home... and everything that goes along with it is worth." So they haven't come up with a figure, and it appears that they have no intention of doin' so. We'll see. He'll just kind of be slumped over and he'll just say, "I never thought I'd say this, but in a lot of ways, it was easier in prison." And that is heartbreaking. This was my city, and a lot of times, I feel like a foreigner. I feel out of place. But it's, like, God, I miss those days, and I miss, you know, bein' a part of that. And even though I've been ordered reinstated, I haven't been back to work yet. I purchased quite a few books... and read books on drawing while I was in there. It was one of the things I did to pass time. It represented very well the distance... between me and my son Jacob. He was born three months after I went to prison. My hand tossin' the ball to him, and then with him with his hand out. Or this one here of Tina's hand, and I drew her hand reaching out to mine. We're at least gonna ask that Scott be placed on the payroll. Because as of now, he's still not receiving any income. So we've been relying solely on my income, and his mom has been wonderful in giving him some pocket change. And my parents have been letting us stretch out the rent. If we took a right down here, it would take us down to high security, where I was for the last year. Thank you. Welcome to the inner sanctum, Tina. Ah! [ Man ] I've worked with thousands of offenders, and I know it's not so easy to get on with your life. I could see it in Scott. This was a guy that never belonged here in the first place, and I felt some obligation to try to help him out. And that's when the friendship took route. I do think that in the month since I've known you, the stare has faded. This place, you know, does change people. You were our test case. Because the question had always been-- when somebody has difficulty adjusting to life after prison, is it because of the problems that they had before they came to prison, or is it the experience of imprisonment itself? And your case suggests that the experience itself takes a toll. And that's sobering. Innocent or guilty, people are people. And I've definitely learned a lot from being on that side. [ Scott ] I was told, in the facility I was at for five and a half years, their job was to break everybody, to break their spirit. It wasn't rehabilitation. There weren't really any opportunities for people to turn themselves around... or to prepare themselves for reintegration. Hi, Jacob. Are you going to Zachary's game? Well, maybe I can pick you up before the game and we can go get a burger or something. All right, buddy. I love you. Bye. [ Phone Clicks ] I know when I was in prison, I said I'd give my right arm... just to spend a couple hours with him... without them being forced to go through metal detectors and razor wire fences. I really miss my mom. I miss the woman that she was. This really did a number on her more than anybody. I have an edge to me, but what this has done to her, it's-- it breaks my heart. He has to reconcile the police officer, the ex-husband, the dad, the son, the brother, the wrongfully convicted person, the incarcerated person, the exoneree all into one, and then figure out where he can move from here, and who he wants to be from here. [ Man ] My grandfather planted that tree before I went to prison. That tree was just a little stick, you know, that he had put in the ground. Look at it now. There it is 22 years later, full grown. Hello. How you doin'? All right? Good to see ya. See, all of this-- this street here? All this street here. All this old neighborhood been changed now. [ Woman ] When an exoneree is released, the first thing that the Life After Exoneration Program does... is work with the family and the community... to find out what resources are available... in terms of affordable housing, job placement programs, training programs, vocational programs, compensation legislation. That money really should come back to these folks... and try to help them resettle their lives. Feels wonderful. It's wonderful. I waited a long time. They assume that when they get out, not only should they have their life back, but their life should be easier. And yet what they find is not what they expect. In the ordinary world no one is dealing... with something as profound as what happened to them. And yet, they have something profound to say. And they have something profound that they've experienced. Calvin, if we were to ask your neighbors if they remember the crime, and do they know that you're out, would you mind that? What you gonna benefit from it? Tell me that. It's the same thing with going to talk to the prosecutor's office. To understand what he's thinking makes me better understand... what's going on with the people... that we're trying to get involved in helping you. [ Man ] Is it tragic that he spent 20 years behind bars, when, if we had the evidence 20 years ago, we wouldn't have prosecuted him? Of course, yeah. It's tragic. But that doesn't mean he was wrongly convicted. Because he wasn't. The system worked exactly like it was supposed to. So, you know, the government doesn't owe an apology to anybody about that. This is just one of those horrible, horrible things. When you left, did they give you anything to take with you? Any money? A-Anything? Yeah, they turned their back, you know? Nobody shook my hand. Nobody told me they're sorry. And that's where Mrs. Vollen comes in. How did you feel that you do have somebody on your side, people willing to help you? Well, I consider her a close friend. Uh, and it's sad to say that someone in another state... has to come to your state, you know, to get you support. Because they don't have a compensation bill here in Louisiana. And it don't seem like they want to get one. [ Calvin ] I was sent to prison for a mistake that I didn't make. It was a mistake that other people made. And it took them 22 years to correct their mistake. [ Vollen ] His plan is to get a barber's license, and eventually open up one of his own shops. But in order to do that, he has to get his G.E.D. So he's enrolled in a G.E.D. program. And since you're in the business community, you probably know what the opportunities are. I think you are the group that offers the greatest promise... to really make a difference. [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Calvin ] I want what everybody else want. I want the right to be free. I want the right to live free. I want the right to be able to-- to support a family. I want my own home. I want my own car. I want, you know, all the things that-- where I can live co-- I want to be financially secure. [ Woman ] Mr. Willis? [ Calvin ] I'm not just trying to get compensation for me. I'm trying to get compensation for the guys that come out before me, for the guys that's gonna come out after me. You see, this is my reason. You know, I could easily just come out and say, "I'm free." [ Woman ] Right. You know? And not do anything. And not do anything. Right. Okay. What it is that we can do in the city of Shreveport... to come on board to assist Calvin-- And you can't do it without a willingness from the community... to accept you back in a meaningful way. [ Woman ] And anyone out there-- They need to do what if they would like to participate? [ Vollen ] They need to join tonight at the Temple of Vision. And I hope to see as many of you listening right now as possible in about five minutes. After being gone for 22 years, and coming home... and staying with my grandmother-- I'm 45 years old. [ Laughing ] You know? "We know after 22 years that you've been locked up in Angola. Could you tell us, are you angry?" [ Laughing ] I mean, you know, would you be angry? Yeah. I said, "Anger stagnates a person's growth." [ Woman ] Yeah, all right! [ Applauding ] I can't allow myself to be angry. [ Man ] All right. He said, "Well, do you plan to find employment?" I said, "Yeah. Do you have any suggestions?" [ Laughing ] I worked for four cents an hour in Angola. That's a great big old plantation. You know. So, if I can't come out here, you know, and work, then that's sad. All right. All right. Thank y'all. [ Man ] My father, highway patrolman-- He used to always tell us, "Look, America has the best justice system." He used to always tell us that. When I got tried and found guilty, my whole faith, my whole belief was shattered... about the justice system. Being trained as a law enforcement officer, there are certain things that you can't overlook. That's probably something that I'm gonna have to live with... for the rest of my life, because there was some doubt there. I-- I really did doubt Herman. But it was just based on the training that I've gotten over the years... to go with the evidence. And I should have gone with the love for the child... rather than the evidence. To have somebody in the family labeled as a rapist-- not only are you frowned upon, but it became a serious issue where the matter was swept under the rug. [ Elmer ] I did not visit him in prison. I've always felt that my job is to put people in jail, not to visit folks in jail. And that's what I told Herman. [ Herman ] I'm gonna always be a step behind. I shouldn't have to be a step behind. [ Herman ] Thank you. [ Man ] Thank you very much. Have a great day, my friend. You happy, right? Huh? You happy. Yes. Most definitely. Thank you, man. [ Chattering ] [ Herman ] My grandmother-- Her thing is, "Herman, I know you didn't do it. The truth will come to light." She has this saying that, "A lie dies, but the truth lives on." She's a big advocate for education. And for me to obtain an education. "Congratulations. Enjoy the gift... "before the next phase in your life begins. "Whatever your endeavor, I know you will succeed. "You are, and will remain, an inspiration to us all, Herman. All best. Justin Brooks and the entire California Innocent Project." I'm gonna be getting drunk in a minute, huh, mom? Yep. It's all that imported beer. [ Herman ] When I was incarcerated, my thought was, not only did I want an education, but I want a doctor's degree in psychology. After I was released, and fightin' one battle, we immediately went into another battle. My mother had cancer and died about a year after I was released. So she wasn't here to see me reach this milestone. So, I'm gonna go and let her know that... today is one of them days. There's not a time that I don't go there... and-- and not walk away in tears. Because every time I do go there, and what have you, I-- I just feel like I'm cheated out of life. When I look at Herman and see what he has gone through, uh, it's just amazing to me. There's a lot of strength there. A lot of inner strength. [ Chattering ] [ Band: "Pomp and Circumstance" ] [ Man On P.A. ] Herman Atkins. [ Cheering ] [ Man On P.A. ] Football scholarship. [ Wilton ] From my understanding, it's an evidentiary hearing... for a new trial and possible release, depending on what the judge decides. I'm hoping that he will dismiss the charges... and allow me to go home finally. [ Man On Intercom, Indistinct ] [ Woman On Intercom, Indistinct ] [ Man ] Just have a seat. Pull up a chair. Hey, how you doin'? Hello. All right. Nice to see you. Well, how's everything going? Pretty good. Yeah? You know, we've been talking for a long time about, "It could be now. It could be now." Um, I think the judge is ready to do the right thing. I think he needs to hear from the scientist. He may find himself a little confused by the numbers tomorrow... and need some time to think it over. But we're feeling good. And so, you know, it could be tomorrow. It could be next week. I wish I had a crystal ball and could tell you. I can't imagine what it must feel like at this point. Kind of stuck. I'm not sure on this-- Yeah. Have you talked to your folks? Were you able to call them from here? Yes, ma'am. Talked to 'em last night. Good. They already said they won't let you wear street clothes. But we'll bring 'em... just in case we need 'em later. Okay. Otherwise, I'll see you tomorrow afternoon. Okay. Okay? All right. Try to get some rest. Yeah. I'll try. Yeah, it's a little loud here, huh? [ Door Buzzes ] See you back here tomorrow. Okay. See you tomorrow. Good luck. Hello. How are you? How are you? Good, thanks. Good to see ya. Yeah. Hello. How are you? [ Nina ] I did. I did. It was getting a little late. [ Mary ] See, this is bigger than what you can even buy in the grocery store. And that little one right there ended up having three tops to it. First time I ever had one of those to happen. Really? [ Nina ] Some kind of mutant DNA in there. [ Laughing ] Maybe we'll take the pineapple to court. "Judge, those statistics are as reliable as this three-topped pineapple." How are you guys doin'? I'm, like-- kind of like Wilton. I'm not tryin' to-- Tryin' not to build up too high. Yeah. Well, that's probably smart. You guys have been through so much. And, you know, you've waited so long. You know, and you've had your hopes up. When you first got the results back, I'm sure-- [ Mary ] We thought it was gonna be quick. Most prosecutors are inclined to do the right thing, and, at least give the guy a new trial, because they know the evidence is so different. I wish I could say what was going on in their heads now. For a prosecutor to say, though, that eyewitness is better than DNA, I-- I don't understand it. Yeah. - And that was one of his statements. - Twenty-two years ago... there was no way to measure that. You know, there's a new study that just came out... of all the people who've been exonerated in the U.S. over the last 15 years. And they found that eyewitness misidentification... was the single leading cause of all of the wrongful convictions. And in rape cases, 88% of them involve mistaken I.D. We've got a place for Wilton when he gets here. If he needs to make changes, we'll make changes, or try to fix it up so he can be here as long as he needs to. But we're ready for our boy to come home. How are ya? [ Vincent ] Things can never be the same. The state must give something back. My mom-- all she thinks of is, "Thank God that you're home. Thank God that you're home." I don't have anything to offer my family but love. I said to them, "My son couldn't have done this... "because he was sitting down with us watching television that evening. So it's no way possible." They say parents say anything for their children. And I'm just praying... that there will be something that's able to be done. If we can't get compensated, my God, it'll help someone else. And thank God for that. Thank you very much. [ Vincent ] I tried to get a compensation bill... for people who are wrongfully incarcerated. Nothing's never happened yet. I mean, I've been doing this for years and years. How long have you been home? I've been home going on seven years now. The jobs I get-- [ Scoffs ] Temporary work. It's hard trying to support my children... on a little basic job, or what public assistance gives me. My mom and dad spent over $150,000 on lawyer fees. That was their retirement money. Now they struggle and got to work again at 68. They should be retiring in the Bahamas somewhere, relaxing, all them years they worked all their life. No, they're struggling, trying to pay bills, and do this and do that. Me? I can't help 'em. I ain't able to help myself. Their struggling, but you're their son. Right. And if your son was in the situation, you would struggle to help him. How do I feel when you got a history of parents being there... for me and my brothers and sisters, but I can't even be there for my own children? I'm not really coming down on myself, but it leads to that depression, because I don't want to come down on nobody else. [ Piano: Soft ] [ Man Humming ] The verse starts here. [ Vincent ] It was music that I think kept part of my sanity... while I was incarcerated, because it soothes my soul, it keeps me calm, keeps me focused, relaxes me-- it takes me to another world, puts me in another place. [ Continues ] [ Man ] He was wrongfully incarcerated... for about 10 years. [ Congregation Murmurs ] And we thank God that the Lord seen fit... to make a way to release him. [ Man ] Oh, yeah. [ Man #2 ] Amen. [ Man On P.A. ] Now, that's something to thank God about. You know, sometimes when you're in a position like he was in, sometimes it's hard for people to accept you. [ Man ] Oh, yes. Yes. Sometimes it's hard to even get employment. [ Congregants Affirm ] So, we want to pray for him, [ Congregants Affirm ] and that the Lord will open doors for him. That he will move forward in the name of the Lord. Amen. Back to me right now Oh, right now I thank the Lord Yes, that's His name Right now Oh, right now [ Continues, Indistinct ] [ Donat ] Yep. Okay. Yeah. Bye. Bye. [ Dennis ] I'm a P.M. mechanic-- that's for "preventive maintenance." I work from 10:00 at night till 6:30 in the morning. The day he came in here, he told me what happened. I told him I didn't care what happened to him... as long as you can fix trucks, 'cause that's what we do here. He's actually a good worker. He's from the old school. There are not too many guys like that left anymore. It's amazing how quick he's picked up, because with the computers-- and he's kind of back from the old-school days... when it's all carburetors and manual pumps and stuff. He's pickin' right up on it. And I'm really surprised he's not so sour. Knowing what happened to him, I'd be pretty sour. He's got a good attitude. [ Dennis ] Other exonerees hold onto the anger and bitterness about what happened to 'em. I got lucky in that I was able to do therapy... and deal with it that way. I don't blame the victims or anything like that. I put the blame where I think the blame belongs, and that's with the police. I look at it as, if I'm angry and bitter towards everybody, then I won't be a productive person in life, and then I won't get the things that I want or the things that I can get. So-- Sure, I still have my days. Get married and have children-- pretty much my hope for the future. Buy a house. You know, settle down. Get back to society. Now most women are afraid of me. You know, I explain to them I've been exonerated. And they get all freaked out. And this is Cupid Junction. Under dating services, my name's "DNA Dennis." You know, I'm number 127. [ Man ] Here-- Here, here. [ Man #2 ] What? This is new evidence. It's exculpatory evidence. Wilton Dedge is entitled to a new trial. [ Nina ] Right. I don't care what they do. They want to try to argue some esoteric thing from Venus-- Get it in front of the jury with a new and fairer trial... where we can present this evidence and then see what they say. That's the bottom line. They pounded on the hair at trial. We now know the hair is not his. All go home. End of discussion. There is no other issue. It is only a commentary on the State of Florida... that you have to assemble this much talent in the room... in order to get one guy out of jail that should have been released-- Three years ago. More than three years ago. [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] Presence of the defendant. We are all here on this matter. The State of Florida v. Wilton Dedge. [ Nina ] We are here today, Your Honor, to close the circle... in what we hope will be the final chapter... in Wilton Dedge's 22-year-long ordeal. When Mr. Dedge was first tried, the prosecutor told the jury... that the hair found on the victim's bedsheet... was identical to Wilton Dedge. Three years ago, we got the results stating... that the two pubic hairs found in that bedsheet... did not come from Wilton Dedge to a scientific certainty. We intend to show that the DNA evidence you're gonna receive... is not only admissible, but that his acquittal... would be a virtual certainty. [ White ] Is a hair actually proof of innocence? The problem is, that hair does not have to be from the perpetrator. The semen that was left does. The two pubic hairs came from two different people, and could not have come from Wilton Dedge. - Is that correct? - That's correct. Now, your lab, as I understand it, is working with some cutting edge DNA. You now have a test that could be used on the "Y" chromosome... to either include or exclude Wilton Dedge... as the contributor of the sperm cell fraction-- [ Expert ] Yes. The State's belief is that we need to back up, and the court direct that this evidence be tested. [ Scheck ] Would anything that you do with the Y-DNA-- would that change your conclusions about the hair? [ Expert ] No. Hair evidence is definite. Those two hairs are not from Mr. Dedge. Frankly, it was that simple then, and it's that simple now. If it was his hair, he's guilty. If it's not his hair, no jury would convict him beyond a reasonable doubt. [ White ] They got a hair that could have come from God knows where. And it's not Wilton Dedge's. And we oughta just say, "Let that man walk." Let the citizens of Brevard County find out if he really is a rapist. Let's find out the hard way is what she tells you. There deserves to be some finality... for victims, for the community. But these people don't have to be fair. They aren't fair. They don't want to be fair. This is Project Innocence. After all of this to-do about whether or not... the State of Florida had the courage to allow a man... to try to prove his innocence. When they fought for three years to keep from having this hearing, and fought to not let the evidence be looked at. This is not supposed to be another trial. This is supposed to be about whether or not... we have submitted evidence to Your Honor... that Mr. Dedge... would in all probability have been acquitted. [ Judge ] Because it is such a serious case, has such serious implications for everyone-- I feel like I've been thrown a curveball on this. I'm gonna have to take some time with it and-- and I have to be comfortable with the level of satisfaction... in regard to all other aspects of this case, but for the Y-DNA. So, we're gonna be in recess on this regard... and, of course, we're gonna consider that issue. Yes, Your Honor. Thank you. [ No Audible Dialogue ] We're supposed to be about ethics. There's supposed to be something called legal ethics. I-I-I-I'm just-- I'm horrified by this. Wilton Dedge was, uh, very, very small, and the perpetrator was described as being very, very big. So this was an extremely weak eyewitness identification case. And 78% of the time in our DNA exonerations, it's been a mistaken eyewitness identification. The single greatest cause of the conviction of the innocent. [ Woman ] Around 3:00 in the morning, I heard a noise. A man jumped on my bed, put a knife to my throat... and covered my mouth as I screamed. It was at that moment that I knew he was gonna rape me. The next thing I knew, there were police officers there. They said, "Did you think you got a good look at him? "Do you think you could recognize him? Do you think you can give us a good description of the man who raped you?" And I said, "Yes, I do. I looked in his face. Yeah, I can identify this man." So I sat down, and I began to piece together... what my rapist looked like. And it went into the newspapers. And sure enough, we had a phone call... from a woman who said the composite sketch looks so much like a man, and his name happens to be Ronald Cotton. Ronald Cotton was found guilty of first-degree rape, first-degree sexual offense, and sentenced to life in prison. June of '95, I get a phone call. And they said, "Jennifer, you were wrong. Ronald Cotton was not your rapist." And there's the picture of Bobby Poole, my rapist, and Ronald Cotton. Ronald's face had become so ingrained in my memory... that I didn't even recognize Bobby Poole. Y'all didn't get lost, did ya? No. But I thought, "I've passed it. I know I passed it." No, you didn't though. I know you didn't. Good seeing you. Good to see you. It's been forever. It's been a long time. It has. I was trying to remember when the last time you and I saw each other. But I thought I'd obviously seen you the night of my rape. It was the physical lineup. I can remember standing there, looking at you, goin', "Oh, God." Of course not knowing how you were feeling. You were probably feeling the same way. Yeah, it just tore me all up. You know, I said, "Why are they doing this to me?" Right. You know, "What did I do to deserve something like this?" Right. That's what I'm asking myself. I had already saw the drawing of the suspect. I said, "That's not me." The guy's ears stuck out at the top. Mm-hmm. You were the closest likeness of the drawing. You had become my rapist. I just couldn't believe it, you know? Tilt my head, looked around the court, looked at all the jurors and-- So, I decided to write my letter... requesting to have a DNA done. They found out that the evidence had been saved. It could have been easily, you know, destroyed. So, I knew that I needed to somehow apologize, but I didn't know, of course, what you were gonna say to me. Right. It took you, like, two seconds. Two-- Two seconds to forgive me. I had debated over that issue... while I was incarcerated. I thought about you. I know I can't make up for lost time. I wouldn't even attempt to. You know, I just have to live, forgive and keep moving on. To say we're friends, it's just-- it's not enough. Ronald and I have a relationship that is so unique. Change one person's life and you've changed the world. So, when you walk out of here... when you graduate, change the world. Don't be afraid to change it. [ Man ] How you doin', Governor? Aaron, how are you? How you doin'? Good to see you. All right. How you been? Hangin' in there, man. I'm loaded up here. I see that. What do you got in here? Good to see you. My little girl. Just had her on the 29th. - Got a real one in there. - Yeah, I ain't waste no time. [ Ryan ] Aaron Patterson was one of four men that I had pardoned... that had been tortured to confess for crimes they didn't commit, and had been sentenced to death row. So, what are you doing with all your time? Tryin' to get guys jobs, just come out of the penitentiary. What do they do with a guy when they turn him loose? Nothin'. They give him a bus ticket. They take him to the bus station. They make sure they get on the bus, or get on the train. And then they-- That's it. [ Ryan ] I believed that the death penalty was an important part of the system... till I became governor and found out how faulted and flawed it was. I was concerned that I may have to look over my shoulder... after I left office to find that an innocent person had been executed, and I had an opportunity to do something about it and hadn't. And I didn't want to live with that. Our capital system is haunted by the demon of error. Error in determining guilt. Error in determining who among the guilty deserves to die. Because of all of these reasons today, I'm commuting the sentence of all death-row inmates... [ Cheering ] to life without the possibility of parole. The United States is the only democracy on this planet... that executes its prisoners. When we talk about human rights and civil rights and liberties for people, we should lead the way in those kinds of attempts... instead of leading the way in the administration of the death penalty. He made it possible for me to have a life, you know. He took matters in his own hands, and that was a blessing, for me as well as this city, this state, and the world. You know, it inspires others to take that bold step to do these things. When you see an injustice, you must step up and do something about it. And that's what we're trying to do out here now. [ Microphone Feeding Back ] [ Nick ] Good afternoon. My name is Nicholas James Yarris. I spent 23 years on death row for a murder I didn't commit. I spent every single day of that in solitary confinement. I was released in January of this year after DNA evidence proved me innocent. I come out here every week and hand out flyers, hoping to get the Delaware County District Attorney... to enter the DNA from a murderer into the FBI's data bank. Why is this case not solved? All I want is the DNA from my murder case... entered into the DNA data bank. The day that they catch the actual killer... I can go on about my life. All of the men who were exonerated by DNA on death row, the DNA is not in the data bank. Delaware County is just denying that they were wrong. They tried to murder me. So what? It's over with. I'm getting on with my life. I apologize. I hope you enjoy your lunch. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. He's a good man. Thank you, brother. Innocent too. And you can quote me. And the D.A. should be-- The whole thing should be brought out in the open, like he's trying to do. He's right. [ Scott ] I still feel like everybody needs to hear about wrongful imprisonment, because everyone's a potential juror. When I first got out, I sent out brochures to police academies, but I don't think they really want their recruits hearing... that they might be arresting somebody innocent. The judicial system is its own little world, and people don't want to change it. People are afraid of change. They're afraid of accountability. [ Woman ] One thing I found when I went through the letters-- Basic problem is too much power concentrated... in the hands of prison staff with no accountability. You're only seeing a portion of the letters that were mailed to you. According to some of these guys, the mail room officers... were shredding quite a few of the letters before they ever went out the door. [ Man ] Is that a fact? That's what they're alleging. We are running into some barriers. I'm hoping-- and I think that we're gonna be working towards... breaking down some of those barriers. [ Scott ] I know that the prison representative here... is going to disagree with everything I'm saying. But we went through the letters, and we were appalled at some of the medical conditions there. I saw firsthand filing grievances, and the indifference-- We really feel like action needs to be taken. [ Sighs ] [ Woman ] Dennis, hi. Of course, I did. How you doin'? Good to see you again. How you doin'? Good to see you. [ Woman ] The State has taken part of their lives, and there should be no question that they deserve compensation. There is no amount that is enough. But the enactment of this legislation which will take place... later today and tomorrow... is to make a step towards discharging that moral obligation... toward these men. My name's Dennis Maher. I did 19 years, two months and 29 days. This bill goes a long way... to, um, straightening out things in our lives, like, we still have records even though we've been exonerated. This bill expunges our records. I went for an apartment. The only way I got the apartment... was I brought my exoneration papers. For the security check, they would have denied me... because I had 16 charges still standing against me, even though I was exonerated for all of 'em. I want to thank all the politicians... for the work they've done. And it's been a long road. Thank you. [ Applause ] [ Scheck ] They want the system changed. They want it changed in a way that will benefit everyone-- future victims of crimes, people that might be picked up falsely, get them exonerated now. They want change. Their sacrifice must mean something. And it's an important motivator for me and my colleagues... to make sure we vindicate the faith they've shown in us. What started out as this small, you know, mom-and-pop operation... has now mushroomed into a kind of, you know, new civil rights movement in this country. It's not just about exonerating the innocent. It's also about reforming all of criminal justice. 'Cause once you implement all these reforms, you've actually shifted the paradigm. The paradigm that we've lived with now for 40 years... is one based on the presumption of guilt. It returns it to one based on innocence, at least until-- unless proven guilty. And also one that understands... just how vulnerable our criminal justice system is, just how easy it is for truly innocent people to be wrongly convicted. - Wilton? - Yeah? Hey, it's Nina. Listen, my dear, I have some really good news for you. Oh, yeah? We got the report from ReliaGene, and you were excluded. All right! They got a result, Wilton. They got four markers, and you were excluded at three of them. Then there's none-- I mean, there's no question whatsoever. None at all. All we needed was one marker to prove scientifically... that you didn't contribute that semen, and we got three. All right! I'm feelin' good. I'm feelin'-- feelin' a lot better. Listen, Wilton, you don't need me to tell you this, but you have done a lot, not just for yourself, but for so many other guys in Florida. You were the first, and you won't be the last. [ Indistinct ] We're the Dedges, to pick up Wilton. [ Sighs ] [ Woman Speaking, Indistinct ] Okay. [ Applauding ] [ Shutter Clicks ] [ Man ] Congratulations. Thank you. It don't look the same. We don't look much-- You don't look the same either. Things have changed. I've been locked up And the key's been thrown away Taken so far away From my family No more Sunday dinners No more midnight snacks Please don't cry, my lady I'll be back one day Let them into your room Your wrist gettin' shackled in cuffs There's nothin' to get you stuffed in the back of a truck And to you this is some new shit 'Cause you lookin' at time from the State and you ain't even do shit Get a sentence for rape is on some clue shit They end up pinning your cases from a few chicks Really can't afford to fall But whatever you say or do Get you accused in a court of law Prison life is so vivid and trite Restricted to the distance from your kids and your wife Can't slip when you're driven to fight And you stressin' 'cause you hopin' they visit or write The day's long and the time's hard Been an innocent man stuck in a cage And finally your mind's scarred You face it and you try hard But you ain't got to serve a drink to be behind bars I've been locked up And the key's been thrown away Taken so far away From my family No more Sunday dinners No more midnight snacks Please don't cry, my lady I'll be back one day This some cruel shit to face Prison and lifting gates People from a different race liftin' weights and gettin' raped Prisoners from different states Till you got no choice but to keep your mind focused and get in shape Criminals here and they watch you close Plottin' a knuckle or brawl or choppin' your throat Can't wait to shuffle the cards and cop 'em a smoke Worry about duckin' the guards and droppin' the soap And it's makin' you a nervous wreck You ain't deserve the stress But you know you're gonna have to rumble to earn respect You can't sleep It ain't sweet Good morning. So, what's new today? I'm walkin' above the ground. Ahh. Now, you have been so wonderful. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you. How you doin'? How you doin'? Great. Ohh. [ Sighs ] Finally. Finally! Great. I know. I know. No more Sunday dinners No more midnight snacks Please don't cry, my lady I'll be back one day This is my little thing. DNA-- deoxyribonucleic acid-- That's God's signature, okay? God's signature is never a forgery, and his checks don't bounce, all right? [ Applauding ] So we all tight. Now it's back to the street startin' from scratch To get back on your feet and on track with the peeps The young full of love and are missin' their father 'Cause Mommy got 'em used to a different provider It's a whole lot to take in 'Cause you ain't got to be guilty for you to do time in the state pen I've been locked up And the key's been thrown away Taken so far away From my family No more Sunday dinners No more midnight snacks Please don't cry, my lady I'll be back one day Knowin' that I'm innocent Hopin' to make a route Thrown in a prison just hopin' to make it out Out of my patience Making schemes of breakin' out But face it Make it clean or weeded out
