This is creepy, Daddy. Where is everybody? I'm sure they're all hard at work, darling. Come on. This is so unbelievably low rent. Good afternoon. We're here to see Miss Fritton. You're not from Inland Revenue? No. I'm er... Camilla's younger brother. Ooh You'll have to forgive me. My brain doesn't kick in till Wednesday when I've been caning it all weekend. You know what I mean. Miss Fritton, your brother's here to see you. I can't understand a word you're saying I said your brother's here to see you Carnaby Fritton No no listen to me very carefully Why would I buy a picture from someone of your dubious reputation? That's what you do, isn't it, Carnaby? I'll get back to you. Hello, Camilla. Mr Darcy, stop that at once. Go to your happy place. Carnaby Fritton. Oh, I haven't heard a word from you in over 15 years. I sent flowers. A wreath... for Mummy's funeral. Oh, you must be my lully, lully niece Annabelle. You're all clear. Oh. So...?your father's PA tells me you're joining us from Cheltenham Ladies' College. For the life of me, I can't understand why he sent you there. Yes, I was an utter fool to be taken in by the excellent teaching standards and their consistently high performance in league tables. In my experience, the teachers are insufferable snobs, and the girls are all shits. Not to worry, my dear. Here, pupil and teacher live in blissful harmony. Daddy. Daddy you can't expect me to stay here It's like Hogwarts for pikeys. It's a little rough around the edges, darling. But that's part of the fun of the place. Here is a breakdown of the school fees. Whisky? There seems to be some kind of mistake. The Bursar never makes mistakes about money, unless it's for tax purposes. But what about...?a family discount? Family discount! You discounted the family years ago, Carnaby Fritton, when you ruined Great Aunt Millicent with your hair-brained schemes. I've done nothing to feel guilty about. Your father has a short memory masquerading as a clear conscience. The fees are 4,000. 1,500. 3,000, take it or leave it. Let's call it 2,000, cash. 2,500. - Two and a quarter. - Two-three. Two-three, done. Daddy, you can't leave me here. Don't be silly, darling. It'll be half term before you know it. - Bonne chance! - Daddy! Daddy! Your old man's Roller looks like it's seen better days. No. It's a classic. Daddy's an expert on the finer things. He has an art gallery in Mayfair. I'm Annabelle... Miss Fritton's niece. I'll have someone come fetch your bags. I'm sorry, I didn't get your name. Kelly Jones. I'm head girl. Really? Welcome to St Trinian's. What are you bogging at... Ugly Betty? Know where my bed is? You saying I nicked your bed? Is that what you're saying? I'll give you a slap. Back off, Taylor. Go paint your nails. She who angers you conquers you. Whatever. Weirdo. The Chavs are a bit touchy at the moment. Oi, are you calling me a chav? So, I told him... They run a chatline and all claim to have slept with a member of the Royal Family. When you've dropped that many US bonds in the market, begin trading... Refused credit? Talk to the Geeks What about this lot? Are they asleep? Goths. We're not Goths, we're Emos. What are Emos? Emotionally unstable. First years. Fulchester's answer to The Sopranos This is you. What are they betting on? How long you'll last. All right, girls. We're live on YouTube. Hm. Now we'll see what she's made of. New girl. - Daddy? - Hello? - Sorry, Daddy, did I wake you? - What is it darling? I want you to come and pick me up from this hell hole right now. I've been broadcast on the Internet. It's like a schoolgirl prank that's all Naked, Daddy! I want you to get me now. - Who's that? Nobody darling I'm tucked up in bed watching Desperate Housewives Daddy, are you coming or not? I'm losing you, darling. Cc-hhh! Hello? Hello? Cc-hhh! Ohh! Annabelle Fritton! Uh...?er... I can't believe what you just did. I'm sorry, miss. I don't know what came over me. I've been looking for someone with a shot like that. I'm drafting you into the hockey team as of today. He's here. Bonsoir, nitwits. Evening. Make it silver. Well, I um... Love the new packaging, girls. But what about the problems we had with the last batch? Problems, Flash? Yeah, the slightly bitter aftertaste, people going blind after the second glass... that lady what died... She was old. She could have gone at any time. She was 38. Yeah? Anoushka. Come here, girl. - Na zdorovye! - Abramovich. Are you all right? - No problem, Flash. - We got ourselves a deal, then. Excellent. If that's permanent... I'll see you in court. Just be aware of that. Ta-da! Nice. Wow. What have we here? It looks lovely, anyway. Like Christmas. What's this, then? Like, sweets, is it? A cigar? Hey, look at me. - They're tampons, Flash. - What... Oh! - Designer tampons. - Why? Why do you do that? A woman doesn't only want to look beautiful on the outside. I can't sell a product I don't believe in. Come on. You wanted a word, Flash? Ooh, yeah. All right, girls. Yeah, well, carry on. Keep at it Yes. Um... I was wondering if you could have a word with the Maths Department. What's the problem? They're very keen to place a bet and that, but they're not so forthcoming when it comes to squaring it with the bookie, if you get my drift. Teachers. Keeping them in line is a full-time occupation. Kell, um... A new Chinese opened in the high street. Apparently it's handsome. I wondered if you weren't too busy, maybe one night this week. Shoot me down in flames if it's not a good idea, but I thought we could pop along, the two of us. - I don't think so, Flash. - No. Stupid idea. I don't mix business with pleasure. And I've got a lot on. Very busy. Busy with all my...?gear here, so... - Nice work on the paint job. - Night, Flash. - Auf Wiedersehen, girls. - See you soon. Incoming 10 degrees south possible hostile Intruder located First years, into position. Morning Miss Oh! But we still need to pay the staff. Otherwise they'll go out on strike. Not now, Bursar. Miss Fritton, if we don't take a firm grasp of this situation, then St Trinian's will have to... Not now. Some dosser's just pitched up. She claims she's our new English teacher She doesn't look like it She looks like she hasn't got a pot to piss in. - Beverly - Sorry, Miss Fritton. She doesn't look like she's got a pot in which to piss. That's better Ah, Miss Fritton, my references and qualifications. Oh, my dear, how lovely. That you made it down the drive is qualification enough. I daresay you'll do very well. The agency tells me you've lost four English teachers in six months. Very careless of us. I expect they'll turn up. Moorcroft! Tuck that shirt in! Sorry, Miss. Muy bien chicas How do you feel, girls? - Much better, Miss. - Anger management. Carry on. No. No, no, no. You will get paid. I promise. Everyone... I'd like to introduce you to our new English teacher. Miss Dickinson. Hello. Welcome. You must try my latest concoction. It's a real beauty. - I call it The Gerald. - The Gerald. After my first husband. Cheap, bitter and completely alcoholic. - Have you been drinking again? - No. no. Just a little breathless. Go on. I'm dying to know what you think. -?I'm teetotal, I'm afraid. But I do like having fun as much as the next person. In fact, I'd love it if we could all get involved in School Challenge. TV quiz show. Popular at my last school and tremendous fun for both pupils and teachers. - Good morning, everyone. - Morning, Mr Thwaites. Please, sit. Now, as you know all too well, our nation's schools have been blighted by the false kindness of namby-pamby, touchy-feely policies for far too long. Badly behaved children don't need an arm around the shoulder. They need a good kick up the arse. May we say "shot in the arm" sir? For the tabloids? Say what you need to say. The important thing is what we do. I intend to start with the worst schools in the country. But that would mean St Trinian's, sir. - What's the matter with him? - Five years ago he went to... that place undercover. He's suffered severe and recurrent trauma ever since. Really? From a bunch of naughty schoolgirls? You wouldn't know, man. You weren't there. When I overhauled the prison service I began by tackling the most fractious, lawless and feared institutions around. Once I'd dealt with those, the others simply fell into place. We'll take the same approach with St Trinian's. Be afraid, sir. Be very afraid. Right. On my command, unleash hell. - Daddy! - Hello, darling. Daddy, look! They're bloody animals. Animals! I'm going to kill them! Try to remember what your behavioural therapist said. Run along. We've entered Bedlam. The very gates of hell. I don't understand why you didn't close this place years ago. Because, Miss Bagstock, they can change. And they will. Not this lot. You'd understand if you met their headmistress. Between you and I, she's worse than the children. A Miss Fritton. Camilla. That's right Completely barking mad Have you heard of her? Ah, Miss Bagstock. Your girlish laughter hit me like the lash of a hunting crop. Miss Fritton, I don't expect you've met our new Minister of Education. - Geoffrey. - Miss Fritton. - So you have met? - University. We were the toast of the dramatic society. Oh, Geoffrey. Another time... Another Country. To what do I owe the pleasure? I've heard that your school is a hotbed of anarchy, ill-discipline... Oh. And your academic results are a disaster. - So I'm here to help. - How lovely. I've got some shelves that need putting up and the kitchens need a good scrub. Unsanitary catering facilities. I'll add that to the list. You know, I think you'll find you and I both want the same things. We just happen to be sitting on different sides of the table. Table? Mortuary slab, I'd say, Geoffrey. You want to straitjacket us with your limited curriculum, which has become nothing more than state-circulated Chinese whispers and you call it education. You've changed, Geoffrey. You haven't. I think Mr Darcy likes you. Let it dry, and then a good stiff brush. Oh, my God. It's Verity Thwaites. She's a total psycho. Come on Cheltenham Ladies Show them what you're made of The important thing is not to provoke her. Who let the dogs out? Who? Who? Who-who? Who let the dogs out? Who? Who? Who-who? Who let the dogs out? Who? Who? Who-who? So, what do you think of my girls? - Hawes! - I beg your pardon? Jemma Hawes, pull your socks up. You're a Cheltenham Lady. I'm sure your girls will try their very best. But It's not the winning that matters. It's the taking part that counts. Snooty cow. Sorry? Emily Snooty-Cow, do remember to stretch. Jolly good. Jolly good. Girls! Look who it is. It's Annabelle the Cannibal. What's that all about? I used to eat people. What? I used to have braces and bits of food got stuck in them. Nice. OK, girls, let's play clean. No biting, scratching, kicking. No gouging. No head butting no punching No slapping, spitting. No um... No gouging. And um...?no non-regulation equipment. Janey, I'm talking to you. OK, into position. Come on, girls, let's take them down. Ooh! On you go, Matron. Right you are. You do know the rules, don't you? Nope. Oh. - Good shot! - Yes! Yes! - Barbed wire? - Check. - Crowbar? - Check. - Wheel clamp. - Check. - Follow the tools girls - Wait for me. Hurry up slow coach - He didn't? - He did! It was just so disgusting. It was still quite funny. But then I said to him, "You didn't?" And he said, "I did." - He didn't? - He did. Just imagine! Posh Totty. Hello, big boy. Shoo, shoo, shoo. Shoo. I'm wearing my school uniform, silly. Although, I'm about to get changed into my gym kit. I did really well in my last oral Although I did find it a bit of a mouthful at first But Miss says if I practise as often as I can I could become Head Girl. We're onto you, so watch your backs! Feel the fear. We're maniacs! St Trinian's! M- A-N-I-A-C. St Trinian's! Look out. Don't Give Up Does anybody have any smelling salts? No, but I've got poppers. Go, girlie! Go, girlie! Fair play. Girlie, girlie, girlie! Ha-ha! I know it's very hard Charles and most of the girls hate it but I really like Greek Charles? Charles? Are you there? What's that? Is that yours? You wouldn't know the way to the hockey pitch, would you? Wargh! Short corner to St Trinian's. Go! You're dead. Yes! Geoffrey, where on earth have you been? You're running quite an exotic establishment here, Miss Fritton. - What a lovely thing to say. - What have they done to you? I quite agree. The best team did win. I suppose the lesson is, don't mess with St Trinian's. We do play a little rough. We can all play rough, Camilla. Maybe we'll be seeing a little more of one another. I'll make sure of it. Ah! Beverly. Beverly. Ow! Beverly, would you like to offer this gentleman something to drink? Sorry, how rude of me. I'm...?I'm afraid after last night we've only got Smirnoff. - Tea, Beverly. - Or tea. Yeah, sorry. Tea, tea, tea... We're not here to drink tea, Miss Fritton. You owe the bank over ?500,000. Aren't you lucky? Christmas bonuses all round, I expect. Because of your decision to ignore our six previous final demands, I am forced to serve you with this foreclosure notice. Final demand? How can there be more than one final demand? Which is the final, final demand? I can't believe you haven't told me about this. Well, actually, I did try to tell you. Not now, Bursar. Beverly, where's that tea? You can't just pull the plug on us, like some underperforming hairdressing salon. This is an institution of learning, sir, and I have a duty of care. I don't answer to you, I answer to my girls. Girls who find shelter in no other schools. A bunch of delinquents and playground terrorists. One man's terrorist is another woman's freedom fighter, Mr... Bank Manager. You have four weeks to repay the outstanding balance... or this school... is declared officially bankrupt. Tea. Houston, we have a problem. Quiet, everyone! St Trinian's is closing down. We're facing the biggest crisis of our lives and you're behaving like bloody children. If this place closes down, we have to go to other schools, and by that I mean normal schools. Thank you, Matron. Mm... Oh... A dark cloud hangs over the school, Beverly. I know all about that one, Miss Fritton. Sits on top of me every Monday when I'm on a comedown. Do you know what you've got to do? You gotta get your serotonin levels back in whack. Red ones bring you up and blue ones bring you down. I believe in a healthy balance. I'll have one of each. Thank you. Mm. Delicious. - Oh, darling! - Daddy! I'll get my stuff and we'll go. - What? - That's why you're here, isn't it? No, we'll...?talk later, darling. Milla. Oi. You might wanna see this. A boutique hotel? But this is my school, Carnaby. The bank's school, Camilla. And when they shut you down, you will have lost everything... and more importantly, so will I. The good news is I've a pal property Oh Milla do listen I think I've come up with a solution that could benefit us both If we move fast, sell the place now, we can repay the debt and er... split the profits. Looks like your old man's selling us down the river. No. Daddy wouldn't do anything like that. What about the girls? What would happen to my dear girls? You can stop the Miss Jean Brodie act, now, Milla. It's me you're talking to. - What about Annabelle? - I don't know what to make of that girl A bit of a drip if you ask me I sometimes wonder if she's actually mine Still a daddy's girl, eh? You're wrong about her Carnaby In there there's a Fritton She's got the true family stripe which is more than I can say about you - You snake in the grass - Let's face it little sister This dump is history - Oh It's no use relying on the grown-ups. We need to sort this out ourselves. Now, the subject of today's lesson is crime. Yeah? All right? You're liking me now. So for every need there is a misdeed And what our need is, in this particular instance, girls, is to get our hands on half a bar. That's half a million pounds for you little ladies Any ideas? Who's got an idea? Anyone? Yes? Shut up! You! - What about extortion? - Excellent. Well done. Yes. Brilliant Extortion Now, I know a lot of people think the old, "Give me your money or else," is a bit old hat, but it's a classic, it's perennial, possible. Good work. Now who else has got any ideas? - Go on, Celia. - Confidence trickery. Confidence trickery. Excellent! - Credit card fraud. - Credit card fraud - Kidnapping, Flash. - Kidnapping! That is more like it. Kid...?napping! So, we take a rich man's wife... - Excellent. Cut off her ear... and then send it to him special delivery. And then...?we just keep chopping... bits of her off... until he pays the ransom. You shouldn't be laughing at that. That is too much evil. You should see a counsellor. Don't leave her on her own. Come in, don't loiter in the doorway. I didn't know you painted, Auntie. Miss. Just having a little bit of "me"? time. Once upon a time I used to think of it as a career. It's jolly good. Did you sell many paintings? Not under my own name. I took it up when I was recovering from a broken heart. We Fritton women are made of sturdy stuff but we do need an emotional outlet, don't we, dear? Hit me. Come on, girlie, hit me! Come on, come on. - Come on, girlie, girlie! - I can't! You can. Let out your frustrations. Inhale your anger and let it all out with a good right hook. Go on. I see. Turn your mind to something or someone who really makes your blood boil. Hm? A snake in the grass who betrays his family ties as easily as he betrays his word. An unconscionable shit. A complete and utter... Oh... Welcome to the fold, girlie. Help your old auntie up. Rah! Oh, poor girl. Let's have a whisky. Come on, ladies, we need to think big. Open your minds real wide. You gotta search for the criminal inside yourself. Yes! Theft. Theft. Finally. Now you're talking. Excellent Theft - Good work. - Bank of England? Bank of England too big. - Woolworths. - Too small. Just sweets. Come on, think about it. I'm telling you... If you don't use your noggins, we ain't gonna get this dough together. I see erm... Yes... Kelly. What about that? Oh, my God! You want to steal Scarlett Johansson? You are so blonde, Chelsea. That is one of the most valuable paintings in the world. And it is here now. We steal it and then we fence it. You'd be able to flog it for us, Flash, wouldn't you? Well, erm... It's probably a bit out of my league, Kel. Number 7. The Heist. Girls, it's time we organised a school trip. Girls, please. Remember we have the school's reputation to uphold. Oi. Bingo. Wow. You can so see why Colin Firth wanted to shag her. Yeah, but you could spruce it up with a dash of colour and some accessories. I'm thinking, lose the earrings and go for some big gold hoops. Ciao-ciao. - So? - OK. They've got 28 CCTV cameras on separate circuits. Four shifts of 12 armed guards patrol the galleries 24 hours a day. Pressure alarms, invisible random lasers, and hydraulically-operated reinforced steel shutters. Golly! - So? - We're talking Mission: Impossible. - That's a no? - lf Tom Cruise can do it, so can we. Yeah, yeah, but the real problem is, how do we get into the building? We need some kind of cover Any bright ideas? So, are we good? It's such a pity none of you want to give School Challenge a shot. It would be so much fun. I only mention it because the final takes place right here. What did you say? - The final will be televised here. In the Grand Hall. The location: Trafalgar Square. The target: National Gallery. This is where our trailer base is. - And the distance? - 114 metres. OK, let's get animated. So here we are... one of the world's busiest squares And Big Brother will definitely be watching us with a surveillance camera on every wall and security guards at every turn So we use the trailer as cover and take the sewers - Nasty. - Who's that? - Ha-ha! Taylor. - What? Why me? I don't know what you're looking so pleased about, Andrea. - You're coming as well. - Shut up! Me and the Corpse Bride? I don't think so. Drop the attitude, Taylor. - Polly - Now... When you get in the sewers, you have to get through these iron gates. Eugh! We have double chemistry tomorrow. We'll start on the explosives. - Good work. Once inside, you'll make your way through to the balcony, which overlooks the Grand Hall. Then you take the zip wire over the audience, while the show is being recorded. It's like 10 metres high. 11,3 actually So after we've got through the rank sewers, iron gates, security guards... And then we've done a live wire act over the audience, I suppose you want us to swim the Channel, and then... climb a mountain... as well! No. You just have to get through these. Invisible random lasers with pressure alarms that trigger hydraulically-operated steel shutters. All sounds frightfully exciting, doesn't it? As for the explosives, girls, I'd go for RD X rather than Trinitrotoluene. There's nothing worse than rogue C-4. Yes, Miss. But all this will be a complete waste of time unless we get to the Final Oh, God, yeah. So, girls...?how do you plan to get us there? That's not a problem. Get yourself on camera and the world can be your oyster One day you're on School Challenge, the next it's Love Island. Soon you've married a footballer and bought the Bahamas. But easy, now, girls, because if you don't take that moment, blink...?and it's back to obscurity. Oi, girls. Jog on. - So who... - J J French. Our last Head Girl, now turned PR guru. People want soap opera. They want to know how to get your look. What diet you're on. They want to know all about your broken hearts and your fashion disasters. But keep them talking, that's the game. That's genius. Then why isn't everybody famous? Because they don't have me. You need to play an angle. Look at Liz Hurley. She wore that dress and what happened? An acting career, her own clothing line and a 15-page wedding in Hello! magazine. Now that's genius. OK, so here's a little tip I learned from Paris. - Hilton? - France. Put on a pair of YSL's and the whole world will think you're a total brainiac. You are welcome to join us on our quizzical quest to find the brightest of sparks, the smartest of alecks, the very pluperfect of pupils in this year's battle to find the champions of School Challenge. On my right in the red corner we have Ampleforth College And on my left in the blue corner it's Peaches Chelsea and Chloe from St Trinian's! What term is applied to a restraint on the expansion of an economy as a result of governmental taxation policy whereby a rise in inflation causes a larger proportion of wage earners' income to be paid in tax? Chelsea, St Trinian's. Fiscal drag. Fiscal drag is the right answer. Well done. Five points. Which Roman poet... Peaches, St Trinian's. Ovid. Ovid is the answer I have on the card. Who wrote... Charles Dickens. Is the right answer. Well, I'm sorry, Ampleforth, you're up against a team at the very top of their form. Quickly. Which Tchaikovsky overture 1812. Is the correct answer. There goes the school bell with the scores standing at which means, I'm sorry to say, Ampleforth College, we have to bid farewell to you. Loser! Loser! Loser! So... how are we going to beat Bedales? Magic The kind you get in mushrooms. - Hi - Hi. Anyone for camomile tea? - Yes. - Thanks. In which Shakespeare play would you find the following stage directions: - Exit, pursued by a bear... ?? Yes. Chas. Bedales. Was it Winnie the Pooh? Caspar... - Are you buzzing, Caspar? - Oh, yeah. You've had your chance You've buzzed... What are you doing? What are you doing? Chas! I'm being touched. Derek, I'm being touched. Derek! Sure, just sign the deal and I'll make sure she says the brand live on air. - Apple - Apple is the right answer Know-it ... all nymphets from St Trinian's Oh, come on, Eton. I'm going to have to hurry you. No, it's gone. And so has the bell! And er...?on that note, I'm afraid we leave Eton... and congratulate our glorious and glamorous victresses, who will go on next week to the grand final to meet Cheltenham Ladies' College It is of course St Trinian's Are we going to close down St Trinian's? No they're more use to us alive You see, as things stand, they're the perfect symbol of misguided youth. They're a beacon of ill-discipline in need of correction. I'm going to make an example of them. I'll break their spirit. They will conform. It's time the world saw what we've been dealing with. Show them the problem...then fix it. The press pack is panting, Peter. It's time we let them loose. Hang on. You want me, a man of my calibre... just to...?bowl into some gallery in London, waltz up to your old man and offer to flog him a Vermeer for half a bar? It won't be you. It will be this guy. Gerhard Von Strubel, the most elusive art dealer in the world. You want me to pretend to be some... art bloke? They've never met, but my father would do anything to do business with him. No, I'm sorry, I don't fancy it. No. What's wrong? Not up to it, Flash? I told you, Annabelle. Hold on, hold on. I didn't say I wouldn't do it. Come on, give us a look at it. I'll give anything a try once. So, erm... What's he like, then, this von Strubel mug? - He's a count. - He sounds like one! No, he's posh. I can do posh, look. Oh, la-di-dah! Shall we go hunting? But can you do German? Yeah, of course I can. Ah, mon freuer... Strindberg Wiederkind J?rgen Klinsmann It'll be all right on the night. Just give me a little bit of time. What's he erm... What's he look like? Well, all I've heard is that he's successful... erudite and handsome. Oh, I almost forgot. He's also very, very gay. Scramble! Black Eagle, one o'clock! Ready to make the front pages, Minister? Peter, the only things the public wants to read about are mayhem, misery and disaster. So we'll be fine. Thank you for coming, gentlemen, ladies. What you're about to witness is the disgraceful result of 15 years of political indifference. Schools like this one are weeds. Long neglected, they've been allowed to grow wild and unruly. - And you're the weedkiller, Minister? - I like it, Denise. Code Red! Code Red! People have often criticised my methods. They say I'm too aggressive, hard-line, whatever. But what I'm about to show you... is the appalling alternative. It looks rather pleasant, if you ask me. You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off. Minister! Minister? Code Red! Morning. ...?are you lot from Inland Revenue? No. Phew! Quickly, quickly. Ready? When the sixth hour was come, there was a darkness over... How can I help you? And some of them stood by when they heard the saint They're bound to slip up sooner or later. Christ! He's coming this way! We're never gonna make it! Who are you? I know your daughter. You're friends with Verity? I was at Cheltenham with her. She was the school bully and I was one of her favourite victims. Really? So Minister your daughter was the school bully And what's it like being at St Trinian's? Oh, it's like... one big, happy... if slightly dysfunctional... family. A bastard profanes the English throne The generous Britons are cheated by a juggler. Geoffrey What a surprise! What's going on, Miss Fritton? The girls are hard at work, and their headmistress is rehearsing the role of a lifetime. Don't you think I make a remarkable queen? You're up to something, and I will get to the bottom of it. I will expose you. Well, you'll have to at least buy me dinner first. Oh, Geoffrey. Oh, not again. Aar-rooo! Not quite the headline we had in mind, Minister. You've had this coming since the day you arrived, Fritton. What are you going to do to me? Give you a makeover, silly. 3 Spoons Of Suga Like a St Trinian. Ah, Lavinia. Are you tempted by our caped crusader? Gah! Why is it that the first face I see is not only the handsomest face in this room but also the very face I came here to talk to? It must be fate. You are? German. Whereabouts in Germany? Bayern Munich. That's a football team. Yes...?and I am their number one fan. Please, don't go. I didn't mean to offend you. It's just...?I get very lonely being German. And a bigwig in the art world. - I imagine. - And gay. - Would you... - Ohh! Whoopsie-daisy! Gerhard, Gerhard, Gerhard! Oh, my God. You're not Count Gerhard von... Sshh, please! I'm trying to keep a low profile. One of the great masterpieces has just become available on the black market. Which masterpiece are you talking about? Well, it's actually rather a big deal. A little out of your league, perhaps. Perhaps it's something you'd er... prefer to discuss over dinner. What? Well, you said how... Lonely you are. We could er...?spend some time together. A nice candlelit dinner, a stroll along the beach... just the two of us... barefoot in the surf. And then... back to my place. Or I could just...?tell you now. - Oh, yes, OK. - Good, it's better. The masterpiece is the... The Girl With The Pearl Earring. Really? The ultimate price was paid by one... who laid down his life... for his sisters and his school.
