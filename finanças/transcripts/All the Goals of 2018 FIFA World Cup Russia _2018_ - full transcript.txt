(dramatic music) - [Narrator] The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. The world's largest nation staging the biggest event in football for the first time. 12 stadiums in 11 host cities. From Yekaterinburg to Kaliningrad. From Saint Petersburg to Sochi. Everybody's striving to make it to Moscow where the final will be held in the Luzhniki stadium. Some of the biggest names in the history of the game were hoping to win the World Cup for the first time. The 2014 winners, Germany, would be hoping to win it again. 32 teams cheered on by passionate supporters from every corner of the globe. And this was the first World Cup to make use of the Video Assisted Referee or VAR. The 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four. The top two from each would go for glory in the knockout rounds. We'll start with Group A which consisted of Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Uruguay. The opening match took place at the largest venue in the tournament, the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow. It was an occasion for Russia's supporters to enjoy seven and a half years after it was announced they'd be hosting the biggest event in world football. Their opponents were Saudi Arabia, who were back in the World Cup for the first time since 2006. The Russian team could count on noisy and passionate support and it would prove to be an opening match to remember. - [Commentator] Near post, good defensive header. That time from Salman. Back in again, free header. And Russia score the opening goal of the World Cup, it's Gazinsky who rises highest. And a better start, the host nation couldn't have wished for. 11 minutes gone in the Luzhniki stadium. Yuri Gazinsky gets his first international goal. Here's Golovin. On his own at the moment. Now he's got support. Here is Cheryshev again, the pass was a little short, Cheryshev, brilliant finish. Cleverly played on to Cheryshev, the chance seemed to have gone but he's had a little bit of good fortune and you can't fault that finish into the top corner. Here's Golovin, great ball across. And surely now Russia can celebrate three points in the opening match of the World Cup. They've allowed Artem Dzyuba far too much space in the penalty area and rising high, no challenge coming in at all from the Saudi Arabian captain. It's another great, what a goal that is. Stunning strike from Cheryshev. And the opening match has been lit up by a goal worthy of winning the final itself. It's his second goal of the game for Denis Cheryshev. In comes the free kick, Golovin, they have got a fifth. Direct from the free kick. Aleksandr Golovin, perfectly executed free kick. This opening day has got better and better and better. - [Narrator] The president of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, was certainly impressed. Egypt supporters were singing the name of one man before they played Uruguay in the next Group A match. But Mohamed Salah was just a substitute in this game where the only goal came in the last minute. - [Commentator] Finally a goal for Uruguay. They lead one nil in stoppage time. Gimenez is the man. He's so good there, he gets in the way of his own teammate, the great Godin, he made it his, he made it happen for Uruguay. - [Commentator] Russia remember wearing the red shirts. Change of outfit for Egypt today. Too near the goalkeeper, elected to punch it, Zobnin plays it back in again, it deflects into an own goal. Oh my goodness me, Al Fathi. And Russia have the lead. Ahmed Fathi turning it into his own goal. Well, it's a calamity really for the captain of Egypt. Dzyuba. Now Samedov. Mario Fernandes, back of the net, that's two nil. And it's him again. Three goals in the tournament now, that's as many as Cristiano Ronaldo. The fairytale continues for the Russian number six, Denis Cheryshev. Dzyuba brought that down beautifully, he's got a chance, and he's scored. Russia running riot, three, on their way for sure now, you'd think, to the knockout stages. His second of the tournament and Russia now with eight goals already. Who on earth could have predicted that given their pre-tournament form? Salah, that's a nice ball, that. Looks for the return, goes down. Now then, what's the referee gonna give? He's gonna give a penalty. Well, it's inside, there's no doubt about that. And Salah scores. Marks his return with a goal, his first goal ever in the World Cup and Egypt's first since 1990. - [Commentator] Always so threatening here, Uruguay. And again, and they've gone in front, Luis Suarez tucks it in. 100th cap and his first of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The young goalkeeper missed it and my they have paid a heavy price, Saudi Arabia. - [Narrator] That win for Uruguay confirmed their qualification before their final game against Russia who also knew they were going through. At the same time as Uruguay played Russia, Saudi Arabia faced Egypt who's 45 year old goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary became the oldest ever player in a World Cup match. - [Commentator] Here's Salah, got a great touch and Mo Salah does what Mo Salah does best. A stellar season for Liverpool and he's got his second goal of this World Cup to put Egypt in front. Only needs half a chance and that half a chance has been taken. His 37th international goal. Big appeals for handball and given. Saudi Arabia have a penalty, it was Yasser's cross that struck the arm of Fathi. Egyptian fans trying to do their best to put Fahad off. Here comes Fahad. Brilliantly saved. El-Hadary pushes it onto the woodwork and sinks to his knees and the story you've heard has just been written by the oldest man in history to play in a World Cup. Fahad struck it well but El-Hadary got across to push the ball onto the woodwork. And another challenge in the penalty area and another penalty. It's a clumsy challenge by Ali Gabr who just put his arm across the back. Or there's a tug of the arm. Here comes Salman. Sends the keeper the wrong way and Saudi Arabia have their first goal of these World Cup finals. And finally they have a goal to celebrate. Trying to pull it back, first time cross in now. It'll touch, took a drive across and in off the post, the flag stays down. And Saudi Arabia have surely now snatched victory through Salem. And that patient build up deep into added time has paid dividends for Saudi Arabia. - [Commentator] It is Luis Suarez and it's in. He's done it again, he found a way past the wall. One of the world's great goalscorers, Luis Suarez strikes again. Deflected effort and in. Uruguay go into a two goal lead. That'll go down as an own goal against Denis Cheryshev. He's got three at the right end and now one at the wrong. Here comes the corner kick. And they've got a third. And this time Cavani has scored and he scored in a Uruguay World Cup win for the first time as well. - [Narrator] Victory for Uruguay meant they finished as the winners of Group A with Russia also qualifying for the round of 16. Coming next the reigning European champions Portugal join the action. On to Group B where the four teams were Portugal, Spain, Morocco, and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The first match in this group was played in Saint Petersburg between Morocco and the Islamic Republic of Iran who had never made it beyond the group stage. The winning goal in this match came in injury time. - [Commentator] Two minutes of the stoppage time remaining. Iran to play it in, it's an own goal. Would you believe it? What a finish to this game. Aziz Bouhaddouz who went to intercept that and planted a perfect header into his own net. - [Narrator] The next match in Group B was between two European neighbors, Portugal and Spain in Sochi. Spain had won the only previous World Cup meeting between these two but Portugal were the reigning European champions. - [Commentator] Ronaldo. Is that a penalty? It is. Inside the opening three minutes Cristiano Ronaldo fouled in the penalty area. Cristiano Ronaldo against David de Gea. It's one nil Portugal and was there ever any doubt? What a start for Portugal. De Gea goes one way, Ronaldo goes the other. It's his 82nd goal for Portugal. Long ball forward, looking for Diego Costa, up against Pepe. Pepe gets the header and goes down, play continues, it's Diego Costa, can he get the shot away? Costa scores. What brilliant skill by Diego Costa. Guedes onside, Ronaldo wasn't initially. Ronaldo with a shot, oh it's gone in. An error from David de Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo gets Portugal's second goal of the night, his second goal of the night. Silva with a little chip. Back across goal, turned in. Diego Costa strikes again. And for the second time tonight in Sochi, Spain have equalized. Now he might drop for the shot here, oh what a shot that is. Nacho, the man who gave away the penalty early on in this match. It's a lovely strike. Curling, bending, in off the post. As so often, Portugal's hopes rest on Cristiano Ronaldo's shoulders. Ronaldo. Oh genius, absolute genius. Would you believe it? Up over the wall, down under the crossbar. It's an exquisite free kick. - [Commentator] In by Moutinho and in by Ronaldo. He is a sensation. The greatest European goalscorer in the history of international football. 85 goals in 152 games for Portugal. - [Commentator] Iniesta the aggressor stabs it forward. Looks to take a return, does so, thinks about getting a shot in here, a turn, and it's into the net. Diego Costa, Spain have made the breakthrough. And this will change the entire complexion of the day. - [Narrator] Going into the final round of matches in Group B, Spain and Portugal were level on points, goal difference, goals scored, and head to head record. The final two matches in each group were played simultaneously. Spain needed a draw or better in this match against Morocco to guarantee qualification. - [Commentator] Ball given away and Boutaib has a clear run here. And he finishes superbly. Spain stunned and in real trouble. Boutaib took it on and was not found wanting. Iniesta dances away, beautifully done, Isco. Order swiftly restored. Iniesta absolutely magical and an emphatic finish from Isco. Fajr's corner's a good one. Oh yes, bullet header by En-Nesyri. The first corner they have mustered and haven't they made it count? Aspas goal. Or is it offside? The goal is given. Iago Aspas off the bench has scored a goal. Beautifully stuck away. - [Narrator] So Spain were going through to the round of 16 but who would join them? The Islamic Republic of Iran or Portugal? A draw would be good enough for Portugal. - [Commentator] Brilliant from Ricardo Quaresma on his return for Portugal. Simply sensational. And it might be enough to take them through. Two years ago, on this day, he scored against Croatia at Euro 2016 and he's done it again for his country here in Russia. Here goes Cristiano Ronaldo. He goes over. And the referee on review, gives Portugal a penalty. This will give Portugal breathing space. Ronaldo is denied. The boyhood dream moment for a young goalkeeper on the streets of Tehran and it comes true tonight. And the game and the group are still very much alive. Rezaeian well forward. Is this Iran's moment? Azmoun gets it down but Pepe waiting for it. Here we go again. Iran still have not scored in open play in this tournament but if they can get a penalty they'll take that. He's given it and Iran jump for joy but is it too soon? There was little doubt about that. And there's little doubt that Iran still have hope. Surely one of the most topsy turvy dramatic nights with two group games going on simultaneously with two heavily favored teams being asked so many questions. It's all over. And Iran's players sink to the floor. It's finished here in Saransk. Iran one, Portugal one and Iran fall agonizingly short as mighty Portugal breathe a sigh of relief. - [Narrator] Spain's two all draw with Morocco meant they had now scored more goals than Portugal which meant Spain finished top of the group with Portugal in second place. On to the goals from Group C next where the four teams were Peru, Denmark, France, and Australia. The first match in this group was between France and Australia in Kazan. Australia had never actually had their hands on the trophy but they were at their fourth World Cup in a row. - [Commentator] Kante manages to allude Mooy and it'll open up here for Pogba, plays it through, big chance for France here, this time, the referee will look at this and will shake his head, it is no penalty kick. The referee might have something to think about there. And the focus is very much on Josh Risdon and it is a review and a potential penalty kick for France. All eyes on him. The decision is a penalty for France. Well, there's some booing around the stadium. Griezmann's never scored in a World Cup finals. He has now. It's France one, Australia nil. And the VAR played its role. The Australians are shouting for a handball here. Gonna have another penalty. The referee thought about that for a long, long time. Umtiti, what a moment for this referee from Uruguay. It's Jedinak versus Lloris. Jedinak keeps his cool. They're back in it. And Jedinak has got his 19th international goal. Pogba. Needs something special from the big fella Giroud. Pogba and it's over the line is it? Well, that could be one for the, yes it is over the line. That may be the winning goal from Paul Pogba. There's nothing a goalkeeper even like Ryan can do about that one, no question. The whole of the ball was over the line. Paul Pogba's 10th international goal may have won the day for France and may have broken Australian hearts after all. - [Narrator] The second match in the group was between Peru and Denmark in Saransk and it was a big occasion for Peru making their first World Cup appearance since 1982. Thousands of their supporters had made the journey. Group C would prove to be the lowest scoring group at this World Cup. - [Commentator] Now some space for Christian Eriksen, the emptying midfield momentarily. Peru. Onside is Poulsen. Yussuf Yurary Poulsen makes the breakthrough for Denmark. World class rears its head in Saransk. Peru guilty of giving him far too much space. - [Commentator] It's Jorgensen to Eriksen. And Denmark take the lead and it's the star man who delivers yet again. Kept it down well, got his body weight over that and thumped it into the back of the net. That's great technique. Four corners for Australia and no goals. That's what they need, Leckie with another header blocked on the way through, now they're claiming there might have been a hand involved. There is a check and there's a possible handball. Mr. Lahoz wants to go and have a look at the screen here. Penalty is what he's going to give. Big moment, this, for Australia. Can they draw level? Jedinak looked absolutely certain before he took it and sure enough he dispatches yet another penalty. - [Commentator] Guerrero. Pogba steals the ball off Guerrero. Here's Giroud. A deflection and Mbappe gives France the lead. The youngest ever goalscorer at a World Cup for France, 19 year old Kylian Mbappe. And France lead here in Yekaterinburg. Through Kylian Mbappe. - [Narrator] France had secured qualification before their final group game against Denmark. Australia had a chance of qualifying but only if they could beat Peru in Sochi. - [Commentator] Yoshimar Yotun. Ball over the top towards Guerrero and Guerrero might be on the end of it here. Sainsbury in his way. Guerrero's ball across, it's Carrillo. Andre Carrillo for Peru. And a South American nation in Sochi collectively finds its feet and finds its voice. Their first goal of the 2018 World Cup. A lovely ball, Flores, released by Trauco. Flores. Guerrero scores. Paulo Guerrero. Keep your eye on Guerrero just by the penalty spot there as it drops to him, just getting there ahead of the defender and Peru double their lead. - [Narrator] Australia and Peru were both heading out, meanwhile, France and Denmark knew a draw would be enough for them both to qualify. - [Commentator] And set for Eriksen. Ball from around the fringes of the penalty area. It is as a potent a weapon as anyone anywhere. Nzonzi. Lemar. Fekir. Rippled the netting but from the outside. Well he means business. Perhaps he's the guy to lift the whole piece, Nabil Fekir. With an afternoon which served a purpose. A mutually beneficial draw, it ends in the Luzhniki, Denmark nil, France nil. - [Narrator] That was the only goalless match in the group stage, both France and Denmark had qualified with a total of just nine goals scored in the six Group C matches. Coming up South America's most successful teams, Argentina and Brazil. The four teams competing in Group D were Argentina, Iceland, Croatia, and Nigeria. The first match in the group was held at the Spartak stadium in Moscow between Argentina and Iceland. It was a new experience for Iceland supporters, their first ever FIFA World Cup match. - [Commentator] Rojo. Aguero, one nil. Argentina off and running and it's cool Aguero. With the sharpest of strikes, his first World Cup goal, Argentina's launch. Sigurdsson. Finnbogason. Magnusson lashes it across the face. Sigurdsson. Bjarnason. Finnbogason one one. They're never down for long. Alfred Finnbogason with Iceland's maiden World Cup goal. Messi. Magnusson in at the back, it's a penalty. Szymon Marciniak did not hesitate. Magnusson's challenge was a clumsy one. Only one man behind this. Messi is denied. Banega. Well, whatever next. Lionel Messi, Lionel Messi denied from the spot by Hannes Halldorsson. - [Narrator] Onto Croatia against Nigeria. Croatia hadn't made it to the knockout stages for 20 years. Some Nigeria fans were feeling very confident. - [Commentator] What do they have up their sleeve at this set piece? Plenty of fun and games towards the back post. Rebic got the flick, it's in. Kramaric takes the credit. But it may well have gone in off Etebo. Indeed. Luka Modric's corner. Balogun got something on it. Has he given a penalty? He has. Well, it seems that Ekong was the guilty man. Mandzukic finding his way to the deck. Modric surely seals it for Croatia. Well, Messi, the master, may have failed earlier on, but Modric makes no mistake. - [Commentator] The need is greater for Argentina after their faltering start but the reward is greater for Croatia. Win tonight, difficult as that may be, and they are in the last 16. That's a gift for Rebic who finishes it absolutely magnificently. They fell apart at the back but they were punished in stunning fashion. Well, it's a nail biter for Diego. Brozovic. Modric. Now he'll unleash one, sensational goal from Luka Modric. And surely now Croatia's golden generation are on their way to the last 16 but where are they headed? Rakitic goes on. Kovacic. Rakitic. They're gonna walk it in. Argentina bedraggled, ragged, desperate, and with real, real work to do. - [Commentator] Moses. Nigeria are looking much more promising. Great ball, Musa, and Iceland caught on the break. Ahmed Musa, the man from CSKA Moscow with the opening goal of the game. A lovely touch by Musa to take it away from Sigurdsson and the finish, well, speaks for itself. Musa again trying to get round the back of Arnason. He's in, it's Musa, across goal, Musa surely. It's the Ahmed Musa show. Just minutes after he hit the crossbar he's put in a second goal and Iceland caught flat footed at the back once again. And Musa makes it four goals in two World Cup matches. And has he secured Nigeria's first three points at this tournament? - [Narrator] Croatia had qualified with a match to spare. But Argentina were in serious danger of first round elimination. They needed to beat Nigeria in Saint Petersburg and hope the simultaneous match between Iceland and Croatia also went their way. A draw in this game would be enough for Nigeria to go through. - [Commentator] Banega, brilliant ball from Banega. Is this the opener? Yes it is. That's what they came to see. And he's provided the touch. His arms are reached up to the gods. Argentina have got what they wanted, it was a fabulous ball from Banega and a stylish finish which Maradona himself would have been proud of. And the crowd certainly would be stunned along with the Argentine players if Nigeria could find an equalizer. Oh, a yellow card given and Mascherano cannot believe this and Nigeria will have the opportunity from the penalty spot. Moses scores for Nigeria. They're level, the Africans hit back and the whole of Argentina is stunned here. Mascherano conceded the spot kick. Moses has scored for Nigeria. - [Narrator] Argentina still had a chance to qualify if they could find a winning goal. They would be going out anyway if Iceland, playing in white, could beat already qualified Croatia in Rostov-on-Don. - [Commentator] Kramaric doing well. This could open up for Croatia. Milan Badelj makes the breakthrough and Iceland now feel Croatia's imprint across their face here in Rostov. Appeals for handball. Referee says a penalty. Yes, there was movement of the arm towards the ball. Now then, Gylfi Sigurdsson needs to score here. Keeps his nerve, hope remains, albeit slim. - [Narrator] With five minutes left in both matches, Nigeria were on course to qualify unless Argentina could score a late goal. - [Commentator] They need a brilliant ball from somebody. They've got their goal. Argentina lives on. What a moment here, Argentina have taken the lead for the second time on the night and this is what it means of all players to score the goal, Marcos Rojo is the man who may just have rescued Argentina. - [Narrator] Meanwhile in Rostov-on-Don, Iceland were still hoping to score a winning goal that would send them through to the round of 16. - [Commentator] It's Croatia who can finish it now. In style. Ivan Perisic. Genuine quality about that finish. For the man from Internazionale Milan. - [Narrator] So, Iceland were out and Croatia finished on top of Group D with the maximum nine points. Argentina made it through in second place but Nigeria were knocked out by Marcos Rojo's late winner. The five times World Cup winners Brazil were playing in Group E along with Switzerland, Costa Rica, and Serbia. And the first match in the group was between Costa Rica and Serbia in Samara. Serbia had only lost one of their 10 matches in qualifying. Costa Rica had enjoyed a run to the quarterfinals in 2014. - [Commentator] It's gonna be Aleksandar Kolarov to hit this and he really can hit tracer bullets of free kicks, this fella. It's a good hit, it's a goal. From the skipper, Aleksandar Kolarov. Fantastic free kick, one nil Serbia. - [Narrator] The second match in the group was between Brazil and Switzerland in Rostov-on-Don. Both sets of fans were showing their affection for their teams. Some also showed their affection for each other. - [Commentator] Brazil making plenty of headway now. Marcelo. What a way to start for Brazil. What a hit from miles out. Coutinho. Brazil lead at the World Cup and that's what the world has wanted to see from Brazil. What a way to celebrate his birthday this week and maybe only the start for him and Brazil at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Shaqiri with the corner for Switzerland who level. Turned in and a celebration led by the goalscorer Zuber. An unlikely goalscorer with a header Steven Zuber. It's not the samba beat, it's the cowbells here for Switzerland in Rostov-on-Don. - [Commentator] And here now Neymar again, checks inside, oh down he goes and the referee this time will point to the penalty spot. Brazil have got what they wanted. The referee has been urged to consult the Video Assistant Referee and to go and have a look at the screen. Was Neymar play acting or will the referee reverse his decision here? He's checked. And has changed his mind and awarded a free kick to Costa Rica. Hope still springs eternal for the Brazilians. It's in there for Jesus. They've got it, they've got it, it didn't matter that it's the 90th minute. Brazil have found their goal and it's Philippe Coutinho who has sniffed it out. Brazil have come up with the goods as they do so often. Can Brazil really put icing on the cake with a second goal here? There is a big chance, it's two, it's two. Brazil are on their way now and Neymar gets his first World Cup goal of 2018. His 56th for Brazil and his fifth in World Cup finals. - [Commentator] Tadic. Very promising stuff for Serbia. Into the middle again and this time turned in. Mitrovic with the opening goal for Serbia and it's a dream start for Serbia. Tadic the provider and what a header that is getting away from Fabian Schaer. Rodriguez going on the overlap. It falls here to Shaqiri. Terrific block. And it's fired in. Granit Xhaka with the equalizer. What a strike that is. Hit with pace, power, and precision. And forward to Shaqiri. It's Xherdan Shaqiri now for Switzerland. Can he win it? Shaqiri scores. What a turn around from Switzerland. One goal down at the break, they have now scored twice in this second half. What a run that is from Shaqiri. He still had plenty to do. Didn't he do it superbly? They will move ahead of Serbia on points. - [Narrator] With two matches left in Group E, only Costa Rica were out of contention. The rest could all still finish in first place. Switzerland were up against Costa Rica. - [Commentator] Shaqiri. Lichtsteiner. That's a useful looking cross, Emobolo's up there, must be, buried beautifully. Blerim Dzemaili puts the Swiss in charge. There was only gonna be one outcome with Dzemaili afforded that kind of room inside the penalty area. Waston. Kendall Waston. The man who got the goal that guided Costa Rica to these finals gets their first goal here in Russia. This is Zakaria. Behind Emobolo, Drmic. A very tidy finish indeed from Josip Drmic. It's a beautifully constructed goal. Keylor Navas left with precious little he could do. Campbell away from Lang who committed himself. And away maybe from Zakaria, that's a penalty. And there's no debate here. Zakaria the guilty man. Bryan Ruiz here can move level with Costa Rica's all time record goalscorer at the World Cup finals. And he does just about. And a terrific performance from Costa Rica. - [Narrator] That was credited as an own goal by Switzerland's goalkeeper Yann Sommer and the draw meant Serbia could only qualify by beating Brazil. Any other result would send Brazil through. - [Commentator] Coutinho, lovely running again by Paulinho. He gets there before the keeper and Brazil take the lead. Paulinho the man bursting forward from midfield and the goalkeeper just a little bit slow off the starting Stojkovic. Neymar's corner, brilliant header Thiago Silva. And Brazil now could well be marching through to the round of 16. The five time winners have got a two goal cushion. It's a free header for Thiago Silva and Brazil now lead here at Spartak by two goals to nil. - [Narrator] That two nil win meant Brazil finished on top of Group E and qualified along with Switzerland. The 2014 quarter finalists Costa Rica finished fourth. Coming next the 2014 champions Germany find things difficult. On to Group F where the 2014 World Cup winners Germany were playing along with Mexico, Sweden, and Korea Republic. The first match in the group was between Germany and Mexico at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow. The previous two World Cup winners Italy and Spain had both been knocked out in the group stage when they were defending the title. If Mexico could win this game, Germany would be in danger of facing the same fate. - [Commentator] Here goes Hernandez taking on Boateng. He's got support here from Lozano. Cutting back inside it's Lozano. It's one nil Mexico. And the man who's shown through the qualifiers has lit up the opening game in Group F. It's Hirving Lozano. Scored against Russia here in Russia in the Confed Cup and now he has a World Cup final goal to his name as well. And if you're looking for young talent to step on a world stage, Hirving Lozano has done just that. - [Narrator] With Mexico beating Germany, Group F was now wide open. Sweden and Korea Republic met in the next game in Nizhny Novgorod. Sweden were back at World Cup for the first time since 2006. Korea Republic were playing in their ninth tournament in a row. - [Commentator] Oh, now that's an interesting one. Referee not heeding the Swedish appeals. Well they are going to check it back in Moscow. This is the challenge. After another look he has decided to award Sweden a spot kick. Andreas Granqvist. The captain keeps cool. Sweden lead. And it really is becoming the World Cup of penalties. Nothing less than perfection itself from the spot. - [Commentator] Hernandez. Guardado made the run. Penalty. Jang Hyun-soo. The referee absolutely, perfectly positioned to make a judgment here. What is to be Carlos Vela's fate here against Jo Hyeon-woo? And Vela scores here in Rostov-on-Don and Mexico are in front at this World Cup again. He was the coolest man in Rostov-on-Don on a steamy evening here, Carlos Vela. Ki is robbed. Lozano goes again and nobody can stop him at the moment in this breakout. Three on two in Mexico's favor, it's Hernandez who scores. Javier Hernandez, his 50th for Mexico. It's two nil and they look set to win again at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. That's well struck, oh what a hit that is. Korea Republic with one of the goals of the tournament out of nothing. Son has tried everything all through this steamy evening in Rostov-on-Don and finally his labors are rewarded. - [Commentator] Claesson, Toivonen. Can he get it down? He's done it. Ola Toivonen has put Germany on the brink of a humiliating exit. And the Swedes on the brink of the last 16. Who would have thought that Germany would, as it stood, be heading for the exit door. Werner's cross, dangerous, in. There's the response, Marco Reus. And the wounded giant has woken up and they are back alive. If Germany don't get something in the next couple of minutes then they really are up against it still. Kroos will go for it and score. An inspirational moment from Toni Kroos. Well, when they're down, when they are tested, they find a way to win. But Toni Kroos has thrown this group right back into the melting pot. - [Narrator] Germany were in second place in Group F, their chances of qualifying were also dependent on what's happened in the match between Mexico and Sweden in Yekaterinburg. - [Commentator] Berg to Larsson, good strike of the ball from distance, he goes back to Berg. Augustinsson has scored for Sweden. They lead and their World Cup hopes are truly alive. Ochoa got down to it but he couldn't keep it out. Berg. There's no doubt for the referee Nestor Pitana, penalty for Sweden. This one's going to present Granqvist with the chance to do it again from the spot for Sweden. And he's done it again. Sweden lead two nil. That is unstoppable. On by Thelin, it's ended up in the net as an own goal. Sweden lead by three, it's Alvarez who's knocked it past Ochoa and now Mexico's heads really are down. Mexico have cracked under the pressure. Those are the consequences. - [Narrator] As things stood, Sweden were heading through and Mexico were hoping Germany would fail to beat Korea Republic. Germany now had to win this match or they were going out. - [Commentator] Ozil to play one in. And they can't make it count. Can you believe it? What a chance for Germany. Well, that's a sliding doors moment, I think for any footballer in this situation. Flicked towards the near post, bouncing around dangerously, South Korea have scored. Can you believe it? Germany are going out of this World Cup, Kim Young-gwon. But a flag's up, the flag's up, it's not gonna count. There will be a review to check that the offside has been correctly given. Oh, it touches the defender doesn't it, on the way through, touches Suele. Has that played him onside? The goal counts. Germany are going home from this World Cup. Neuer now is playing as a midfield player. There's gonna be another goal here. This will be it. Son Heung-min. Two nil, that is it, all over. Amid wild and incredible scenes in Kazan. Neuer playing up there, you do wonder about the wisdom of that sort of thing really. It looks dramatic but that kind of thing can happen and it seals the fate. It feels like the end of the world. It's certainly the end of the World Cup for Germany. Their World Cup is over, they are bottom of the group, they've lost two group games for the first time in history. The curse of the champions strikes again. Two nil to South Korea, incredible. - [Narrator] Although Korea Republic managed to beat Germany, it wasn't enough for them to qualify. Instead both Sweden and Mexico were celebrating qualification in Yekaterinburg. Sweden finished on top of the group ahead of Mexico on goal difference and Germany, the reigning champions, finished in fourth place. Coming next Group G featuring free scoring Belgium. On to Group G next where the four teams were Tunisia, England, Belgium, and Panama. The first match in this group was between Belgium and Panama. Panama were making their first ever appearance at a World Cup and there was a carnival atmosphere at the Fisht stadium in Sochi. - [Commentator] Just away by Torres, the captain stretching and turned back in, what a strike that is. The volley was sheer perfection. Look at that. Kevin De Bruyne. Outfield pass and headed in from Lukaku. Romelu Lukaku with the second goal for Belgium. De Bruyne outside of the right boot, curling it in to Lukaku. Hazard, head down, charging forward, options left and right. Lukaku timed his run beautifully, Romelu Lukaku. Three nil. Beautiful breakaway goal from Belgium. And how about that for a finish. - [Narrator] The second match in Group G was between Tunisia and England in Volgograd. Tunisia were back in the World Cup for the first time since 2006 and this was the highest scoring group in the competition. - [Commentator] There's Ashley Young over the England set piece. Floated in by Young, Hassen got across but it's turned in from close quarters by Harry Kane, captain's goal for England. The three lions have flown out of the. You just knew it would be him. In by Bronn. Penalty. Foul by Walker on Fakhreddine Ben Youssef. Walker threw back his left arm, Ben Youssef collapsed beneath it. Ferjani Sassi steps forward. And he scores. And he gives thanks. And Tunisia are level. Trippier, Maguire, Kane, has stolen it at the death. Trippier's corner, Maguire's flick, Kane's finish, England's points. - [Commentator] Meunier. Hazard's gone over. And the challenge from Ben Youssef and the referee has pointed at the spot. Eden Hazard, this mercurial Belgian talent. Scores with certainty. It's not taken them long, this team of so many talents, hits the front again. Meriah, that's a poor touch from Maaloul. And Mertens' pounced and Lukaku's ahead of him. It is Romelu Lukaku, it's two. He has fizzed that in. Right on top of his game, Romelu Lukaku. And Belgium are looking fearless and formidable. In by Khazri, it's a good header, they found something. Right back in it. Dylan Bronn got across the Belgian defense and steered it home and Tunisia are in business again. Kept it in, he might wish he hadn't. Meunier. De Bruyne. Meunier. Lukaku. That is another delightful finish from Romelu Lukaku. My goodness me that was deft. Hazard is onside here and beyond the keeper and had to score. First touch with his chest, second a feather like touch to settle the ball down, the third, thereafter a formality. Tielemans. Batshuayi has his goal and Belgium have five. Goodness me, he'd had a few go's, Michy Batshuayi. If at first you don't succeed, keep plugging away. Ben Youssef. Nagguez, Khazri. Well, he'll have the last one, if not the most meaningful. And right at the end of stoppage time, Wahbi Khazri converts the seventh goal of a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon. - [Commentator] Maguire and Stones both forward. Trippier will take. And what a goal that is, John Stones with it. England make the breakthrough and Stones with the header. It flies past Jaime Penedo. Trippier in towards Lingard. It's Jesse Lingard now for England, down in the penalty area and that is a penalty to England. Escobar with the challenge, Torres coming in as well. Harry Kane, England's captain, up against Jaime Penedo, the second most capped Panama player in history. That's two nil, it's emphatic from Harry Kane. Struck firmly and sweetly and England double their lead. Lingard. Young. Lingard latches onto it after Cooper can't keep hold of it. Jesse Lingard, three nil. Super strike from Lingard. Lingard the creator and then the executor of the goal. Trippier stands behind it. Flicked forward by Henderson. Back in across goal and almost a fourth and now it is. John Stones again. England are having the time of their lives. Sterling denied by the goalkeeper. Stones with the final header. Maguire's header. It's a penalty, foul in the area on Harry Kane, to the floor and off the ball incident. That's the foul by Godoy. Kane against Penedo. It's the same way, it's the same result. It's a virtual repeat of the first spot kick. Loftus-Cheek. Unleashes one with a left foot and it takes a deflection and in off Harry Kane. Harry Kane creates a little bit of history. Only the third England player to score a hat trick at a World Cup. Can Avila provide the opportunity from this free kick? He can indeed, it's turned in by the substitute Felipe Baloy. It's their first ever goal at a World Cup finals. - [Narrator] England and Belgium were both guaranteed to qualify with a game to spare. They would play each other to decide who would finish first. Meanwhile, Panama and Tunisia were playing for pride in Saransk. - [Commentator] Rodriguez, deflection and in. Panama take the lead. 20 year old Jose Luis Rodriguez will be claiming it but it took a big deflection that wrong footed the goalkeeper Mathlouthi. This could open up now for Tunisia. It's Wahbi Khazri. Beautiful. That's just fabulous football from Tunisia. They equalize through Fakhreddine Ben Youssef. But they cut a swathe through that Panama defense. North African side come forward again, they're in, two one. Beautifully crafted again, Wahbi Khazri. And from one nil down at half time, Tunisia lead two one. - [Commentator] Januzaj. Tielemans. Thought about a shot there for a moment. Januzaj does go for goal and finds it superbly. Adnan Januzaj gets his first goal for Belgium. Just beyond the outstretched hand of Jordan Pickford. Michy Batshuayi getting one firmly in the face off the post. - [Narrator] So Belgium finished as the outright winners of Group G and they were the highest scorers in the group stage with nine goals. Panama's first World Cup appearance had ended with three defeats. Coming up Group H where qualification went right to the wire. The final group to get started was Group H where the four teams were Colombia, Japan, Poland, and Senegal. The first match was between Colombia and Japan in Saransk. Colombia had made it to the quarterfinals in 2014 while Japan had been knocked out in the group stage. - [Commentator] Osako. Sanchez has just lost his man here and Osako is in. Big save and then a block. They're appealing for a penalty, Japan, penalty the referee says. High drama and a red card. Deliberate handball says our Slovenian referee, Damir Skomina. Shinji Kagawa will be entrusted with the Japan penalty. And Japan take the lead. Coolness personified, Shinji Kagawa. Quintero. Can he deliver? Under the wall and in. Colombia are level. Japan arguing that the ball had not crossed the line but it had. Oshima stays it home and it's in. Yuya Osako. Perfect header to the perfectly flighted corner. - [Narrator] And the last two teams to play their first match of the World Cup were Poland and Senegal. Poland were back at the World Cup after missing the two previous tournaments. Senegal had reached the quarterfinals in 2002. This was their first appearance since. - [Commentator] M'Baye Niang was slightly stronger than Piszczek. Mane just inside it. Diouf there as well. Here's Gueye. Takes a deflection and Senegal take the lead. Gueye found the space. Not sure that was going on target so it could well go down as an own goal for Cionek. Niang back on the field and he's round the goalkeeper and he'll get there first. Szczesny furious with Krychowiak. What was Krychowiak thinking trying to help the ball back in his own direction? And once he got that first touch, Niang, to take him away from Bednarek there was only one outcome. Grosicki. Good ball, great header. Krychowiak pulled away at the back post, found the space, and headed it back across N'Diaye, no chance for the goalkeeper. - [Commentator] Stuns one up to the far post. Poor header. Could be punished and it's gone in. Senegal take the lead. That's a really poor header. Mane was on the spot to punish Japan. Here's Nagatomo, can he get on to this, he can. He's got the pace to trouble Senegal, and Inui scores. What an excellent finish from Takashi Inui. The goalkeeper knows exactly what he's intending and still Khadim N'Diaye couldn't anywhere close to it. Now, it's Senegal's turn to turn the screw and it could be a goal, it is. Moussa Wague, 19 years old, what a moment. Osako teases one in. Goalkeeper doesn't get there. A real chance, two two. Keisuke Honda levels for Japan. Unbridled joy for the Japanese. - [Commentator] Clever ball back for James. Great ball in, great goal Colombia. They take the lead. Yerry Mina, all he had to nod his head there. It was beautifully set up, it was easily finished. They're looking for what would be a big second goal here. Quintero, brilliant ball in. Colombia are on their way. Super goal. Super reaction. Radamel Falcao stroked it beautifully into the net. Cuadrado can really put the icing on the cake, it's three. It's Bedlam in Kazan. Juan Cuadrado scores for the second World Cup finals running. Cuadrado timed the run, timed the shot, and again, Szczesny, not a hope in the world of stopping this one. - [Narrator] With the final two games to come in the group, Poland's chances of qualifying were over but the other three teams were fighting for two round of 16 places. While Colombia played Senegal in Samara, Japan were playing Poland in Volgograd. - [Commentator] In by Kurzawa and thumped home by Jan Bednarek. And Poland have reason to smile and Japan have reason to frown profoundly. Jan Bednarek timing his near unnoticed arrival impeccably. - [Narrator] With Poland winning, Japan were at the mercy of the results between Senegal and Colombia. - [Commentator] Here's a header, Colombia lead. The stadium absolutely erupts here and the ball bounces down and up into the net beyond N'Diaye. - [Narrator] With that win, Colombia won the group while Japan and Senegal were tied on points, goal difference, and goals scored. Japan became the first team ever to advance because of a better fair play record. These were the 16 teams that made it to the knockout stages with six former World Cup winners left. Uruguay, France, Argentina, Brazil, Spain, and England. Two of those met in the first round of 16 match in Kazan, France and Argentina. - [Commentator] Mbappe. Really has got a turn of pace. It's showing here, look at this, from Mbappe's. Hang on a minute, it's a penalty. It's a penalty for France. Maybe the first contact is outside but it carries on inside doesn't it? Antoine Griezmann. First blood France, one nil, Griezmann strikes again and it's the early breakthrough they were looking for. Ever Banega. Di Maria. Oh what a goal, what a strike. Argentina level. It's Angel Di Maria with the sweetest of strikes. It almost left a vapor trail. Banega takes it, goes a long way, comes out to Messi. On that famous left foot, deflected in. And Argentina lead. Messi hits it and it just got another flick on the way through from Mercado. Pavard. How about that? Glorious Pavard puts France level. Pick that out. Hernandez. On the turn there was Matuidi. And Mbappe. Yes, France in this seesaw game, three two up. Matuidi, good ball, Giroud. Helped on here, Mbappe's got another one. Four two and now France really are in control. Messi again. And Argentina have another one. Sergio Aguero, four three. An epic game between two of the biggest names in world football and France are in to the quarterfinals. - [Commentator] Cavani. Suarez over on that far side and it's pinpoint. A dangerous cross, Cavani. It's them again. That fearsome front two combines to give Uruguay a stunning start here in Sochi. Pepe has done it. Pepe pouncing for his sixth international goal. Pepe's header fell kindly for Nandez. Four on three for a moment here. Cavani, brilliant. That is pure gold. A moment of classic Cavani. That is simply stunning. - [Commentator] In by Asensio and in. Spain snatch the lead. Ignashevich may well be credited with the final touch. Samedov takes, Dzyuba is up, Pique was climbing, too, it's a penalty. Gerard Pique penalized. What a kick of the football for Artem Dzyuba. Has he the heart. Can he lift his nation? And Dzyuba scores. And the hosts are happy again. Russia roars as one. Penalties will decide. Now Denis Cheryshev. Cheryshev. Match point, match point. If Spain miss the next one, Russia win. Akinfeev saves. It is Russia's party and the party goes on. This nation is going to dance all night. - [Commentator] Knudsen and he's got a long throw on him. Kjaer almost got there. And the shot is put towards goal and turned in. The goalkeeper, Subasic, half gets hold of it but that's not enough. Rebic. Blazed across goal by Vrsaljko. And turned back in for the equalizer. Mario Mandzukic, what a start for both of these sides. The perfect response from Croatia. From despair to jubilation for those Croatian supporters. Both teams have taken four penalties in this shootout. Both have only scored twice. Denmark must score. And it's saved by Subasic. Jorgensen denied. Now this is it for Croatia. Ivan Rakitic. To put Croatia into the quarterfinals and a tie against the hosts Russia. And he's done it. Croatian celebrations, Danish despair. Croatia are through to the quarterfinals of the World Cup. - [Commentator] Neymar one on one. Let's see if the superstar can produce something special here. It is Neymar. Clever back heel, to Willian, into the area, Willian. Brazil score. Neymar has his second World Cup goal in 2018. Fernandinho plays it into the path of Neymar. Neymar, got to be two. Brazil are on their way into the last eight. This time it's Neymar the provider. Thank you very much from Roberto Firmino. - [Commentator] It's missed by Vertonghen. It's a great chance for Haraguchi. He scores. Are we on the way to yet another huge upset? Put forwards towards Osako. Here's Kagawa. Trying to find room for the shot. It'll eventually come in, two nil Takashi Inui. What a strike. Dreamland here for Takashi Inui and Japan and Belgium in real trouble. Not the most convincing from Kawashima. Back in, what a header. It's a tremendous goal from Vertonghen. Remarkable that he gets that over the goalkeeper into the far corner of the net. Hazard. Found room for the cross, Fellaini. Against all the odds it would seem, Japan had a two nil lead. It has now been extinguished. Courtois safely grabbed. And there's just time for De Bruyne to lead this attack. Japan desperate to cover the spaces, they can't do so for the moment. Lukaku and here's the winner. Can you believe it? Nacer Chadli strokes Belgium into a quarterfinal against Brazil. It was a brilliant counterattack from Belgium on a dramatic, enthralling night in Rostov. - [Commentator] Toivonen now. Forsberg, big opportunity here. And in. Took a little deflection on the way. Emil Forsberg arrives at this World Cup alright. Little flick off Akanji on the way but Sweden have liftoff here in Saint Petersburg. - [Commentator] Trippier takes, referee's seen a push and given a penalty. Carlos Sanchez would not set Harry Kane free. Harry Kane is England's priceless gem. And England strike first. This is time being added to time. Cuadrado takes and Mina scores. Colombia save themselves at the last. Penalties, penalties, penalties. Bacca, Pickford stops it. And England now reach out and touch it. Eric Dier. And England win on penalties. England are World Cup quarter finalists. - [Narrator] Coming up, five times winners Brazil, the entire host nation gets behind Russia, and England are among the goals in the quarterfinals. The quarterfinal lineup was complete, Uruguay versus France, Brazil against Belgium, Russia versus Croatia, and Sweden against England. The first of those four games was between Uruguay and France in Nizhny Novgorod. - [Commentator] Antoine Griezmann stands behind this free kick. Benjamin Pavard is there as well. Griezmann. And hugs it toward goal and in by Raphael Varane. The defender strikes for France. It's there first attempt on target in this match and it is the opening goal of this match. Pogba. Griezmann setting off on one side, Mbappe on the other. Tolisso. Here it is, Antoine Griezmann. Griezmann to shoot, and it's gone in, an error from Fernando Muslera. Antoine Griezmann with a second goal for France. Fernando Muslera, a huge mistake from the highly experienced Uruguayan goalkeeper and France are through to the semifinals at the 2018 World Cup. - [Commentator] They've got nine six footers in this team. Brazil have only got three. Flicked onto the near post and they have the lead. And Brazil concede first. It comes off him, doesn't it, last? Kompany attacks the near post and then the two Brazilians mess it up and it's off Fernandinho. Well that's an absolute nightmare. It's Neymar with the corner kick. Miranda was looking for the near post flick on. I tell you what, Marouane Fellaini does really well there to win that. They needed winning, here's Lukaku now. Like a tank, he's done well. De Bruyne. De Bruyne, two nil. Belgium what is going on here? Brazil in deep, deep trouble now. His 15th goal for his country and I would say the most special. Think one Brazil goal changes things totally. The dynamic will be so different. And now they do get a goal. Renato Augusto and he's given Brazil a lifeline. There's always something sad from a neutral point of view when Brazil go out of a World Cup. But that is exactly what's gonna happen, they are knocked out, the favorites have gone. Belgium have pulled off one of the biggest, if not the biggest, win in their history. They make the semifinals for only the second time ever. - [Commentator] England have scored from set pieces at these World Cup finals. Who's on the end of it? England are on the end of it and it is Maguire, Harry Maguire's first international goal. It's another set piece which comes off for Gareth Southgate's team. A player growing with maturity with every match who rises to the occasion. Lingard, room for a shot, deflected into the path of Trippier. Again Sweden have everybody back there defending. It's in to a useful area here. It's into a very good area. It was on to the head of Dele Alli. The ball is into the Sweden net. Dele Alli who gets his third international goal on the end of a delightful chip from Lingard. Gareth Southgate is jubilant. England are through to the semifinals of the World Cup. - [Commentator] Cheryshev. Dzyuba. Cheryshev's not stopped. Denis Cheryshev. That is quite something. What glorious, glorious goal on one glorious Russian night. Here's Mandzukic. It's in. It's Kramaric, it's one one. Andrej Kramaric claws Croatia level again. At 90 minutes it's one each and extra time follows. Modric with the corner. And Vida with the header. And Croatia glimpse the semifinal and Russia have it to retrieve. Russia's hour of need. Dzagoev takes Fernandes. Russia will not retreat. Astonishing. Russia are not finished yet. Penalties again. Mario Fernandes made this possible for Russia. Fernandes has dragged it horribly wide. The man who saved them now imperils them with a ragged penalty. Ivan Rakitic with the opportunity to strike the telling blow. Rakitic and Russia dissolved into tears as Croatia's cream rises closer to the top. But Russia's long summer love in is painfully over. Croatia four three on penalties. - [Narrator] With four teams left, France, Belgium, Croatia, and England, the semifinals are coming next. (slow triumphant music) (lively music) - [Voiceover] The semifinals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup were between France and Belgium, Croatia and England. The first of those was France against Belgium in Saint Petersburg. The third time in 20 years France had reached the semifinals, and Belgium's first appearance in the last four since 1986. It was a tense game. (crowd cheering) - [Announcer] Chadli's at play, Giroud didn't really hold of it! Oh, and it's a splendid sight to deny Alderweireld by Llorris. How important might that be? Griezmann with the corner kicking Umtiti arriving on the near post, there's the breakthrough. It's Samuel Umtiti for France. And France now can sniff the World Cup Final. Tremendous piece of play. The World Cup Final looms for France against Croatia or England. They've beaten Belgium by a goal to nill, here in St. Petersburg. (lively music) - [Voiceover] The second semi-final took place at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. This was England's third appearance in the semi-finals. Croatia had only reached the last four once before, in 1998. - [Announcer] Little corridor of white through which Trippier might considering striking. It is Kieran Trippier! It is delicious! (crowd cheering) Glorious, glorious, England goal! And England in their immaculate whites have made an immaculate start. (crowd cheering) A lack of teh-ch for Vrsaljko, aimed and beyond. Mandžukić and fired home by Perišić. (crowd cheering) Croatia's cravings are satisfied, at least for now. And the semi-final is back where it began. As we head into extra time, could be anyone's. Co-co-kah there. It's over to Perišić, Mandžukić hits! Croatia hit the fronts! Mario Mandžukić pounced and England are hurt, England are hurting. Croatia against France for the rights to be champions of the world. - [Voiceover] The finalists had been decided but before France would face Croatia, the beaten semi-finalists, Belgium and England met in the playoff for 3rd place. - [Announcer] There's Lukaku and a bit of space as well, Chadli. Here's crosshair Meuneir, one meal to Belgium already. (crowd cheering) And Belgium has got their 15th goal of this World Cup already. Deh-bry-ner, lovely ball Hazard can certainly goal here and does! Eden Hazard for Belgium, two - nothing. Belgium in 3rd place then, at this World Cup, having beaten England, two - nill here in St. Petersburg. (lively music) - [Voiceover] And that left only one match to be played at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. The ultimate prize in world football was at stake as France met Croatia in the final of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. (crowd cheering) - [Announcer] Flicked in by Griezmann and flicked on! And France take the lead in the World Cup final. (crowd cheering) Deft delivery from Antoine Griezmann with assistance from Mario Mandžukić. He faded it in, Vrsaljko appeared round the back. Mandžukić can compete with Pogba, came down for Vida and then Perišić won one! He has screened that in! Croatia are never behind for long. Ivan Perišić again. (crowd cheering) In by Griezmann. Antoine repealed at the near post by Perišić. The French are screaming, "hand ball." And the referee is choosing to look himself. Truly this is a matter of opinion. What a call to have to make. (crowd cheering) He's given a penalty. A penalty for France in the World Cup Final. Antoine Griezmann... France have their lead back! They lost their lead for ten minutes, barely that. Mbappé taking on Strinić. Mbappé, Griezmann, Pogba! Pogba! (crowd cheering) For France, and possibly now the world! An iconic French goal for Paul Pogba who has come to the party and just might, just might have won it. Hernández twisting away from Mandžukić, lining up Vrsaljko. Here's Mbappé, oh my word! Teenage kicks, the ultimate teenage kick. The boy with the world at his feet, Kylian Mbappé. There ain't no stoppin' him now. Aw, Lloris was caught on it by Mandžukić. And Croatia have a little sniff. Lloris offered it him and this crazy, crazy game twists once more. It is France, allez le bleu! It will be some can-can on the Champs-Élysées tonight. From Bah-loy to Biarritz, Calais to Cannes, Sure-pull to Sha-mo-knee. The trophy is returning to the Land of Jools-Remay. The final score at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. France, four, Croatia, two. - [Voiceover] 169 goals were scores in 64 matches in Russia. The winners, France, scored 14 of them.
