(CHORAL SINGING) (INSECTS CHIRPING) WOMAN: Are you hungry? Your father will be home shortly. I'll change my clothes, then keep me company in the kitchen. (DOG BARKING OUTDOORS) (OMINOUS MUSIC CREEPING IN) Good morning. MAN: Water... Water. Mom! In a minute. (GASPS) Shh. Be quiet and don't move! Ma! I told you to shut up. MOTHER: Don't hurt us. - Search the house. - MOTHER: Take what you want, go. (GRUNTING, SCREAMING) (GUNSHOTS) Run, Matias! Run...! MAN: Isabel! (GLASS SMASHING) - WOMAN: Zeca! - (GUNSHOTS) Help me! (GUNSHOTS) (OMINOUS MUSIC FADING OUT) (DISTANT SIREN) (HOSPITAL MACHINES BEEPING, INDISTINCT CHATTER) Please God, help us. (BEEPING CONTINUES) MAN: Mrs. Santana, you're fully dilated. We have to deliver the baby. (BEATING PULSE) (INDISTINCT CLAMORING) We have to deliver the baby... push! You're going to give birth now, push! (BEEPING CONTINUES) Mama, it's okay... (BABY CRYING) - (DEEP EXHALING) - (MONITOR FLATLINING, GROWS LOUDER) (BABY'S CRIES INTENSIFY) ("BOTO BOTO" BY BONGA PLAYING) - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, General. Is my brother inside? Open the gate. Yes, sir, but the commander asked not to be disturbed. You have ten seconds to open before this gets ugly, understood? I'm sorry, General. (GATES OPEN) (FLIES BUZZING) Dias. (MAN COUGHING) Take him out of here. (MAN VOMITS) (COUGHING) (PHONE LINE RINGING) - Have you got them? - MAN: I'm looking at them, boss. Nobody steals from me. Understand, boss. Kill him. (GUNSHOT) You speak English? Good. You're next. Unless you can think of something to make me and my friends there, happy. (GENTLE CHANTING PLAYS) You understand what I'm saying? Whatever they want, whenever they want it. And then maybe we can forget you and your boyfriend's stupidity. (SOBBING) Go to work. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BROTHER! MAN: Dias, where are you? We have a location, we're ready to move in. You're needed here. Call me. GENERAL BERNARDO: Matias, I see you and Dias as my sons because I was very good friends with your father. But... as commander of the police, it's my duty to act and say your brother's recent behavior is unacceptable. I'm disappointed. Has he lost his mind? Dias' heavy drinking, not reporting in for days, relaxing at home, not getting his ass to work. All our attempts to help him and it seems our efforts have no results. But, this kind of behavior cannot continue, not on my watch. MATIAS: I understand, Commander and, I apologize on his behalf. The anniversary of my parents' murder is the same day my brother was born. Birthdays are never easy for him. But there is no excuse. I was going to give you one month's leave as requested. I have given this a lot of thought. I'm assigning you as the DNIC Commander. So you can keep him an eye on him. You will be my eyes and ears on this operation. You and your brother will get this done. Understood? (MOTORBIKE ENGINE REVS) (PHONES RINGING) Get out. (CLAPPING) Hey, Commander Dias Santana is here. About time. Less we have to deal with that nappy wearin' lieutenant, the better. - (CHUCKLING) - Hey. I don't think that guy's ever fired a shot in his life. The only shots he fires... are at his wife's ass. (LAUGHING) Hey, have some respect. What's up, boys? What are we talking about, football again? Sergeant Marco. Pull that tongue back. Might swallow a fly. No, I was just... staring. I know you all missed me, so save your niceties for someone who needs it. I hope your minds are still fixed on our mission, because it's happening. Sergeant Qeto, the details. - Good morning, men. - ALL: Good morning, Sergeant. Okay, our mission today is this warehouse in Mutamba. We have information that this complex houses one of the biggest drug operations in the city. I'm going to pass this over to Agent Orlando who worked with Sinse Investigations. ORLANDO: Obi Chukwu. Nigerian. The ringleader's right hand. And the big boss? We don't know his name or who he is. We call him Mr. X for now. Maybe his mama never gave him one. (ALL LAUGHING) Okay, settle down. Okay. General Matias will be leading the operation with Commander Dias. - You got that? - ALL: Yes, sir! Commander... I'd like to be on this mission. All right, but don't screw up. (ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT YELL) (DARK, BROODING MUSIC PLAYING) (BLUESY MUSIC PLAYING) What's your name, agent? On the streets, Shefor, dirty man. But it's Roland, my name's Roland. Well, Shefor... as of now, you're off the street. Your mission's over. Finito. You can go back to the UK. What's the lowdown inside? There's thirteen men and eight women, a few of them top ranking. They've got assault rifles, some battle rifles, AK-47s and Jerichos. The women are basically slaves, they never leave. And X? I don't know, it could be anyone. I know they're moving a lot of cash today, so he's got to be here. Good job, agent. Take a nice long vacation. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) DIAS: Listen up, Mr. X is most likely here. No description... but... we have Mac 10s, AK47s. Bring the heavy fire power and let's be smooth about it. - Understood? - ALL: Yes, sir! I want to thank you for what you did at your house with the chief... and the motorcycle... but I can take it from here. From now on, I turn around. I don't need your brotherly concern or help anymore. Four years and nothing has changed. Commander, as your superior I suggest you get with the program if you want to stay a cop. Okay, guys, let's lock and load. (INDISTINCT CHANTING) (INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING) General, we've got garbage that needs removing. MATIAS: Already on it. Marco, De Costa. Greenlight, entrance. Sir, already got them in our cross hairs. Injured, or in a body bag? MATIAS: Gentleman, people are going to die and it's not going to be one of us. Bag them. (GUNSHOTS) (HARD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Shit... Got one heading your way. Reis, deal with that. Okay, perimeter secure. Breach, breach, breach! Fuck me, look at this place. Fuckin' mess. Hey! It's a fuckin' mess! Everybody, radio in. Blanco, all good. Clean room quiet. Beanie, roof secure. OBI: Tito... Tito! Tito. You better not be asleep, huh? Clear out the front, boss. Okay, now listen, stay alert. We have a lot of drugs and money to move today, stay alert! Copy that. Hey, Ze Maria, don't get cocky about it. You want to radio him something better? It worked. I hope so, let's move. (GRUNTING) Deal with this. (GRUNTING AND PANTING CONTINUES) Quiet! Not a word. I'm going to take my hand off your mouth. Please... don't scream. You understand? Obi! You'll never get off the shot. Your call. (GUNSHOTS) (SCREAMING) Everybody get down! And shut the fuck up! (GUNSHOTS) Cover me! You'll live. (CRASH) (BROODING MUSIC PLAYS) (GUNFIRE) Friendlies down here! General Matias, there's a runner on the east wing, and he's carrying a briefcase. Could be our boy. - MATIAS: Have you got a shot? - No. Have you got him? Negative. Throw it down. (ENGINE STARTS) I need your car. Everyone, get out! Everybody, out! Everyone, shut up or bang bang, understand? OBI: Boss, we got nailed. DNIC and military at Mutamba. What about my fucking drugs, and my fucking money? It's gone, all of it. The drugs and money. Get to the port near the Marginal. I'll organize your pick up. (TIRES SCREECHING) (CLAMORING) (THUD) (BRAKES SQUEAL) (GASPS) (PROPULSIVE MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHS) Go ahead. Run, asshole. (PROPULSIVE MUSIC CONTINUES) (BRAKES SQUEALING) (MAN GROANS) We are flying out today. Get the bag ready. You've got fifteen minutes. Sweet talk him, lie to him, I don't care. Just get the name of his boss. You want to be a field agent? Here's your shot. - What the hell is this? - Change of tactics. If I go in I'm just going to kick his ass, so let the kid have a crack at it. Perp's in there. (DOOR CLOSES) I hope you know what you're doing. Good afternoon. I'm agent Orlando, I'll be asking some answers. No. I'm asking questions, you giving answers. Just for the record, I'm showing the prisoner pictures of wanted criminals. What can you tell me about this one? Are you crazy? You're lucky I don't beat your ass. How many times... have you guys tried to kill Commander Dias? And failed. We are the police. You know... if the boss had wanted to kill the Santanas, he would have done it when he killed your mother and your father. Or any time since. You see... the boss is still upset with the General for putting that scar on his face. You're still alive because he wants you to be. He should have killed me in my mother's womb. Where is your boss? You will put in the report that the prisoner tried to reach for your weapon. On the count of ten. Shoot this asshole. I swear by my mother and my father's grave that I will kill you now. Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... - Tell them now, Mr. Chukwu. - Five... four... three... talk... Okay, okay... Okay. He's probably in South Africa by now. That is where he does most of his operations. He has people everywhere. In the police, DNIC, the military. I'm probably a dead man now. (SOBBING) (LAUGHS) What? What? You think you got me? No, you never got me. I got you. His name is... Makimba Ferreira. And he sent me here with a message for you. He's coming. And you won't even know it. We're going to get him. I promise. - DIAS: Yeah? - How you doing? I'm alright. We're all getting together, remember? Not really interested in a noisy club. We have a meeting with the NP Commander tomorrow. We'll get Ferreira. You should come tonight. It'll be good. Dias... I don't know what happened between us, but maybe it's happening for a reason. Okay, if you don't come for me, do it for your men. Anything else? No. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Glad you made it. Happy birthday. Happy birthday! (PEOPLE CHEER) MAN: Happy days. Cheers! ALL: To a happy birthday! MATIAS: Turn down the music! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Today is my brother's birthday, well, not today, a few days ago. MAN: Woo! I want to wish him a happy birthday with a special song by... Marco and Ze Maria. ("INSTAGRAM" BY DJ DIAS RODRIGUES PLAYING) (RAPPING IN PORTUGUESE) (CHEERING) - Happy birthday, brother. - Yeah, thanks. Now enjoy your ass and let me get this place jumping! (POP MUSIC IN PORTUGUESE PLAYING) Excuse me... dance? Not tonight. (GRUNTING) (FAINT MOANING) General Matias, your appointment has arrived. Appointment? Damn, I need to get to DNIC this morning. Remind me? Zentex from South Africa, the expiring arms contracts. Right, send them in. General Santana. - Good morning. - Morning. You enjoy your birthday? I don't really do birthdays, but yes, it was a good gesture. So, what do you do? I'm a cleaner, I clean the rubbish from the street. You're getting ready to leave. Okay, will I see you again? No. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done this. I have to go. Hello, Mum. - How are you? - Good. You look well. - Who's that? - CHILD: That's you. With that big head? Oh, I don't know about that. - CHILD: It's not really big. - (PHONE RINGING) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) WOMAN: Oh, great. I'm gonna have to take this... excuse me. You back in Cape Town? Good, let's meet. What bullshit! Do they actually want to clean up the crime or they just want to talk about it? That sounded like all talk and no action. How are we going to get Ferreira in South Africa if we can't go there? I don't know what just happened. I'll find out. This was supposed to be a strategy meeting to bring Ferreira back. Then someone got to them. And what does that tell you about them, the ones you want to be like? I'm done. From now on, I'll do things my own way if I have to. Walk with me. I find walking keeps the energy moving. It's less awkward. I assume this is an awkward moment, you having lost two million dollars of my money? It's not like we are in the furniture business. We have risks. Which is your area of expertise, what you're paid to mitigate. Can I presume the police were involved in the loss of my two million? I'll deal with it. A cop, we go back many years. - He may be coming here. - No, he won't. And don't deal with it. I can live with the two million. But dealing with an officer of the law, it could cause greater losses I won't be so willing to walk away from. It's central Africa. It's practically synonymous with corruption. Now find a way and ensure that my operations aren't put in jeopardy in the future. Does that make sense? Yes? Yes. Good. Beautiful day. Enjoy it. ("SE APODEROU" BY EDDY TUSSA PLAYING) (LAUGHING AND SHOUTING) I'm sorry I'm late. No, the dedicated general keeping people safe. No need to apologize. Thank you. Sorry about the other night. Sorry for what? Unless you're here to arrest me, or need me professionally, Commander... I'm going for a swim. (LAUGHING) I've enjoyed this more than I have in a long time. Me too. You know I'm afraid of the ocean, ever since I was a boy. And here you are in the middle of the ocean. Should I be impressed? Are you? I'm hanging out with the boys in The Borough tonight. That's our spot. You should come down and join us. - Pretty please, sir? - Maybe. Maybe? Okay. Come, I want to show you something. (ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING) My father lived here with my grandparents before they moved to the city. I was six, but I still remember visiting during the war. My father said, "I need to protect the family", when he was gone. After they were killed... I was taken to live with a family in Cunene. Dias was not so fortunate. We've never been close. Fuck it, why not? (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (BIKE ENGINE REVVING) Evening, gents. Relax. Cold beer, please. Good to see you're out. Any word on Ferreira? I know where he lives. ORLANDO: He's not exactly keeping a low profile. I also found about the tragedy he brought to your family. No need to get into that. Keep me informed. I will. Have fun tonight, okay? That's an order. Okay. ("MEDO" BY LEOKENY PLAYING) That is my father and my mother. I was six then. Thank you. Teach me how to kizomba, I've always wanted to learn. ("BETINHO" BY ARY PLAYING) Is this how you live a little? Sitting alone? - I'm not good with people. - At least that was honest. If you go after Ferreira in South Africa, I'd like to be in on it. Orlando's not the only one who knows how to get information. I'm sorry about your mother and father. It's not hard to figure out you're going after him. I could be an asset. A man and woman traveling together as a couple attracts less attention. Think about it. Mh? ("MANEIRA LEVE" BY LEOKENY PLAYING) Kizomba is personal. You must surrender... ...to everything. And let the man... guide you. I'll see you all Monday. If you find anything else, let me know. All right, take care. (SOFT MOANING) (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) (SILENCED GUNSHOTS) (SILENCED GUNSHOTS) (DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE) (GUNSHOTS) (DRIVING ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYS) (GUNSHOTS) (DEVICE WHISTLES) (EXPLOSION) (MAN SCREAMING) Open it! - You know how to use a gun? - I've never tried. You sell weapons and you don't know how to use one? If anyone comes through this door, you just point and pull the trigger. - And if it's you? - You don't shoot. (WHIRRING SOUNDS) (ETHEREAL STRINGS GROWING LOUDER) (GUNSHOT) (SOFT BEEPING) Where is he? (ENGINE REVVING) - (FAST BEEPING) - Shit!

Take the kill when you can! (GUNSHOT) Second lesson. Shut up and shoot. - Are you alone? - Give me a gun. (SOBS) - Excuse me one moment. - Of course. - What are you two doing here? - We need to talk, minister. Right now. He's the main guy, the head of it all. Cut off the head and we stop the biggest drug operation in Angola and Central Africa. And the murders that go with it. He killed three of my men tonight, men with families. And three of mine. They spoke English, they're not even from here. We know where he is in South Africa. Send us and a group of undercover agents. Ask the Deputy Minister and Commissioner Martins to come in. As much as I'd like to think so, I'm not the only voice. What you're asking can only be done if he can be captured or eliminated discreetly. I can't allow the two of you to cause problems between South Africa and Angola. You are my best men... but the country's reputation comes first. Gentlemen... We have a sensitive issue, which I know I can rely upon you to assist with. We need diplomatic visas to South Africa. And I assume untraceable weapons? Sir, do you know what you're asking? I do. I'm doing it for the defense of the country. Consider it done. Shouldn't be a problem. I don't need to tell you not to speak to anyone. Unfortunately, confidential information in the NP seems to get bought and sold like milk. They definitely have someone inside. We can't trust anyone. I assume my actions have met with your satisfaction? BOTH: Yes, sir. He's checking you for a wire. I'm curious... Was it something in my words... my tone... my demeanor... that perhaps suggested to you that I speak simply to hear the sound of my own voice? I know people cursed with that malady. They open their mouths but what comes out are just... empty words. Devoid of thought or meaning. I don't expect an answer as... I had assumed I had made it perfectly clear regarding the policemen that I specifically asked you not to touch. I do business in several countries and employ many people who perform the same responsibilities as yours. If you feel the need again to put me, my business and my family at risk, I will not hesitate to make an example of you to others in my employ. In the most horrendous way possible. Does that make sense? Does it? Yeah, walk away, asshole, go stick your fucking head in a hole and maybe it'll all go away. God damn it! Are you insane? He's from the President's office. So what? Let him fire me. Hell, I'll hand in my resignation if this is the best we can do. - I'm sorry, General. - Thandi, what are you doing here? I was there last night and it wasn't just the two of you he tried to kill. You owe it to her. Tell her we don't actually arrest criminals in Africa. - I have contacts in South Africa. - No. I live there. So how difficult do you think it will be for him to figure out who I am, where I live? - I can help you get him. - Can you get weapons? - And more. - You're both crazy! You want to spend the rest of your life in prison? Do you want to spend your life looking over your shoulders? Because he's not going to stop until we're all dead. You know that, Matias. Wake up, Matias. You're living in a fucking fairy tale if you think the law will protect us. (THUNDER RUMBLES) ("SOUND BOY KILLA" BY THE RUDIMENTALS PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND) (SIGHS) (SNIFFING) (GROANS) Dias fucking Santana, boof! And his brother, boof! And maybe a Scot next! Get me a light. I don't smoke. You don't smoke. (GROANS) Who fucking asked you if you smoke! Fuck! My guys can't even kill two simple Angolan cops from Cunene, Endivja! Where the great king, Mandume... laid with his balls! In the bush! Turn the fucking music off! (MUSIC STOPS) MAN: This is the other witch, boss. FERREIRA: This is the witch? Ha! Are you guys crazy? Are you just playing with me? This... is the witch that was chased away from Angola? She doesn't look like a witch. (SNIFFS) She doesn't even smell like a witch. (RUMBLING) You're good... very good. I want Dias Santana dead! (WITCH) Dias Santana has a very strong spirit. You must put this necklace on him. And then you need to cut off his head and eat his heart. I will bring him the demon of the deep forest and the evil Brusharia, the dark spirit of Kabinda. With this, he won't be able to stop it, or you. There's just one thing... What? I want my money first. (LAUGHS) Okay. You will get your money. And I get Santana. Hello. Thank you for taking my call. - That matter we discussed? - MAN: Yes? Our mutual friend has decided on an early retirement. (INDISTINCT VOICE ON PHONE) I agree. Life is about choices. Thank you for your understanding. (SIREN BLARING) Evening, gentlemen. I know I'm the last person you wanted to see. I know you don't have much time. I'm not here to stop you. The man you're after is hosting a party tomorrow night. Apparently intended to celebrate... your demise. I hear you've been put on the invitation list. The Angolan government will denounce any non-sanctioned actions. You're on your own. So we get this guy, right? - (LOUD WHIRRING NOISE) - Yeah, we get him. And we get our lives back. You all right? What's the matter? I'll be fine. (MAN LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) Pelele! Ah! I have just had the best news I've heard all week! Some of my old acquaintances from Angola are coming to my party tomorrow night. I feel like celebrating. Who should I celebrate with? Ah! You, you and ah... you. Don't worry, they are with me. Any more surprises? (WIND WHOOSHING) Thank you. Thank you for what? Letting me help. And for coming here. I should have my head examined. At least, with me I know you are safe. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Eh, you look like Elvis! - Thank you. - You're late. Yeah, uh, traffic. - Sorry. - Right. Something else? Yeah. No. Uh... WOMAN: R5 assault rifles. - 5.56 caliber. - (COCKS GUN) Standard issue police assault rifle. Very reliable, based on the Israeli Galil. Fourth gen Glock 17. Not my favorite, nine-mil polyp, eighteen round mag. - Pass me the sniper, Thandi. - Here. If you look for something to cover some distance, we have this custom Enfield sniper. Re-chambered to a 308. Built in silencer, high powered scope... extremely compact. With all of this, can't say I wish I was going with you. THANDI: Thank you, Amanda. Good luck. We take Ferreira dead or alive. Any objections? Alive if possible. How likely is that with an army of gangsters around him? If capturing him is on the agenda, then yes... we'll kill him if we have to, but we're not here as assassins. (LOUD NOISE) Are you okay? Yeah, just... just tired, I guess. I'm going to get some air. I'll keep an eye on him. Something is not right here. It started back in Angola. Okay, let's do this! (INDISTINCT DEMONIC VOICE) What's happened? He started shouting, then passed out. That's it, we need to abort. We need to get him a doctor. No, no doctor can help me. It's black magic. Dias, what are you talking about? I heard Ferreira uses witches to take down his enemies. Black magic... It's over. I'm in command here, you are not fit to carry on. You can't tell me what to do. You lost that right a long time ago. I knew this would happen, you'd blame me. I was six years old, goddamn it! I blame you for a lot of things... your rich family in Cunene, while I went from one shitty orphanage to the next. When you came to Luanda, where were you? I lived on the streets and had to fight to survive. I got into trouble with the people I ran with, but they were more family to me than you ever were! I kept coming back for you, but you were always so difficult. And that family took care of me like I was their own. You never wanted to listen, you still don't! Stuck in the past where you've always been. You might as well have been buried with your parents. At least you'd feel right at home. You hear, you idiot! - You arrogant son of a bitch! - Hey! (GRUNTING) Fuck...! (GUNSHOTS) Sorry, guys! We ain't got time for this shit. Landlord's not going to like that. Does it rain in Cape Town? I didn't know you felt like that, brother. It doesn't matter. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, me too. Are we going to do this? Huh? (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Let's split up. Thandi. Orlando, where are you? I'm out back, on my way. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Orlando, we need to hurry. Ferreira may arrive any moment. ORLANDO: I'm coming... Nearly there. (BANG) DIAS: Matias, we're coming out, Orlando has your weapon. - Wait here. - Okay. MATIAS: I'll cover the entrance. Get to the main floor. Thandi, it's time for you to go. MATIAS: Take the car... (AUDIO CRACKLES) Thandi, look at the guard. (AUDIO CRACKLES) (INAUDIBLE) What are you two doing here? We were enjoying a little privacy. Lift up your arms. (DETECTOR BEEPS INTERMITTENTLY) (CONTINUOUS BEEPING) - I can explain. - You better. (DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES) Hello, everybody! (CHEERING) Welcome to my party! Look! All I want is for you guys to have some real good fun! (CHEERING) But if things start getting interesting, please, come get me! (CHEERING) Mr. DJ, hit it! (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) I have eyes on Ferreira. MATIAS: Do you have a clear shot? There's too many people. (YELLS) DIAS: If he comes this way he's mine. Orlando, blend in. Oh, yes, sir. Breach, breach, there's been a breach, woman in a black dress, man in a white jacket! We've been found out. Time for plan B, things just got crazy out here. MATIAS: Orlando, get us a ride out of here. MAN: Hold it there. What is the problem? Yeah, we've got a suspicious male... ORLANDO: I've got wheels. Hold tight. (GUNSHOTS) We have to get out. Get to Orlando. Set up to give us cover, we're going to need it. Watch your back. - Are they here? - Yeah, and we have to take them out now. This game you're playing... They've taken down three of our guys. (GUNSHOT) Four. They don't leave here. This party is a celebration for our good Commander's untimely demise. So it shall be. So it shall be! (LAUGHS) Where's Celia? I sent her to the car, she should have passed you. MATIAS: We have to abort, she didn't pass here. DIAS: I can't leave her here. You go. I'll finish this myself. I'll find her... and get Ferreira. (DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES) - (GUNSHOT) - (SCREAMING) Orlando, any word on Celia? Dias. Matias, you go, I'll handle this. Let her go. I'm Dias Santana. - The one your boss wants. - Drop your weapon. Really? You should have gone. Put down your gun. Or they're both dead in three seconds. Okay, okay. Drop your weapons. Turn around and put your hands on your heads. MATIAS: Orlando, get out of here. Get to Thandi and go. (WATER DRIPPING AND ECHOING) (GROANING) Where are we? I'll tell you... when I find out. Hold on, brother. Hold on. Where's Celia? Celia... I don't know. We have to find a way out of here. Gentlemen... So you actually thought you could just prance in here and, what... arrest me? Very heroic. Now both of you are going to die like dogs. That's no way for heroes to die. Tell me... What's it like... to finally meet the man that killed your mother... and father? But, of course... we've met before, you and I. Shit! (GRUNT) Why don't you let my brother and Celia go? (LAUGHS) Funny you should mention... Agent Celia. MATIAS: Celia... I tried to warn Dias, but he couldn't leave it alone. You bitch! (LOUD WHIRRING) Why did you do this, money? Money? Ferreira is my uncle... and I've worked for him since day one, and when you and your brother disappear, I'll go back and I'll keep working for him and maybe one day head up DNIC. They will discover and then nail your ass. - CELIA: I hope you enjoy this, uncle. - The demon spirits have got him. Very powerful. No! (MYSTERIOUS SOUNDS) - (GUNSHOTS) - (SCREECHING) You're lucky I didn't put a bullet in your head all those years ago. Now you can pay for my scar. Cut both their heads off and send them to DNIC. Bring his heart to me. No one fucks with me. No one! I waited 35 years for this. To be honest, I'm not satisfied. Time to leave. I'm tired, I'm bored. MATIAS: Cut me loose and I won't let him kill you. - You're a real funny bloke. - MATIAS: Dias. Let's see how funny it is when I skin your brother alive. Dias, wake up, brother. Dias... (THUNDER RUMBLES) (PROPULSIVE MUSIC PLAYING) Dias... Dias... Dias... Motherfucker! Get my car. (GUNSHOTS) Get us out of here. Drive, drive! (GUN CLICKS) Take care of my brother, get him to a hospital. I'll get Ferreira and Celia, she's the mole. Give me the car keys. Celia? Damn, she was so hot. MATIAS: No hospital. Don't lose sight of Dias. (FRANTIC MUSIC PLAYING) Orlando, stop here. Get Dias. - (GLASS SHATTERS) - (TIRES SCREECHING) (WHIRRING) (FERREIRA SCREAMS) I should shoot you dead, here and now... but I'm not you. You're just going to have to rot in prison. (CALM ACOUSTIC MUSIC PLAYING) (GUNSHOT) (IMPACTFUL MUSIC PLAYING) You should have killed me when you had the chance. (GUNSHOT) (ELEGIAC MARCH PLAYS) Dias. Mr. Mackie, sir. The visitors are here, from Ghana. Thanks, Robert. - What's Ghana, Daddy? - The land of milk and honey, sweetheart. Land of milk and honey. ("VOU FICAR FININHO" BY EDDY TUSSA PLAYING) You okay? (PHONE RINGS) Santana. MAN: Did you kill him? You're going to die, Dias Santana. Who is this? You killed my brother, Ferreira, and now I'm going to kill you.
