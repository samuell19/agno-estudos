Okay to clean it up? We've got a couple more races. Western tracks. Charley here? Not yet. It's not like him. He is always here by now. Yeah. Then why isn't he? You know what? Maybe he went fishing. Kyng is the best fisherman you ever saw. Sleep good, Ed? Okay. - Want to eat something? Eggs maybe? Sausages? What time is it? 14 minutes and 32 seconds to six. Saturday March the 9th. But it don't tell the weather. That is Mr Kyng now. Hello Sleigh. Who did you expect? - We thought it would be Mr Kyng. No. It ain't Mr Kyng. Pete. Ed. Sticky out? - Yeah. Looks like rain. Lucky for some people when it rains. How's the wife? - Same as ever. You know what I found her doing today? Washing dollar bills in the sink. You don't say. - Yeah, with soap and water. I hope she doesn't iron them with a hot iron. Your missus. She is a real lady. Yeah, she is a lady alright but she sure is crazy. That tycoon. Next to Mr Kyng he is about the best husband ever. Yeah. Yeah. Helen. How you feeling, baby? That's good. Look, honey. I left the windows in the living room open. If it starts to rain .. You had better close them. Uhuh. No. I won't work too hard. Yep. Yes, I will be careful of bums and robbers. Yes. I will. Yes, baby. Goodnight. Then why didn't he phone? If nothing is wrong why didn't he phone? Maybe he's home. - No I phoned. He wasn't there. You shouldn't have called Charley's house. Mr Kyng will kill you if you've scared Mrs Kyng. She said he was here. He'll sure fire if you have scared Mrs Kyng. I haven't seen him all day. Why does he have to report to us? We are working for him, remember. He went fishing. That is what he did. Something is wrong. I know it. Wait until he brings back those big son-of-a-guns. We'll eat fish tomorrow. It is kinda funny. Charley ain't been out of town or missed a day since .. Since we opened this place 15 years ago. Or in the before either. You want to get my shoes? Brown ones? Look in his office. Maybe he came up the back way. Check. Mr Kyng? You there, Mr Kyng? Mr Kyng. Evening, Mr Kyng. - How is it, kid? Well, I am getting in shape for my comeback. That's good. - Yeah. Good evening, Mr Kyng. - Good Evening. Good evening, Mr Kyng. Inside. The boys have been looking for you. Those Easter lobsters, sir. We have .. Charley. Hello, Jim. I think tonight is my night, my boy. About time, isn't it. Time and a half. You know Joe Josephs from my barbers. - Yeah. Glad to see you, Joe. - He thinks I'll be lucky for him. Yeah, I've been telling Joe. To break Charley Kyng you need three things. Lots of luck. Lots of money. And lots of guts. Well, at least you got the money. Evening, Mr Kyng. I am sure glad to see you. Sure glad. I'm expecting somebody name of Palmer. - Palmer? When he arrives, steer him right to me. Okay? Yes, sir. Hit me. I said hit me. Sorry. It was over at Tim's place. The fifth in this poker game is Ben Snelerr. Heads. - Tails. Snelerr? I thought he was dead. - Tails. Who is Ben Snelerr? He wants to know who Ben Snelerr is. You playing? I got some business with Charley. - He sent for you? No. I thought .. If he sends for you you'll have business with him. Ben Snelerr once owned three limousines filled with dames. So, are you playing? I got a better chance for my two bits with the slot machines. Remember that night in '34? With Ben and Charley? It became a draw. Charley stood pat. Ben draws one card. Up to that time there was almost 15 grand in the pot. Ben draws a Queen to give him a full house and pushes in $20,000. Charley sees and raises. Five raises there were. Ben finally calls him. Charley lays down a straight flush. Seven to the Jack. All spades. There's a photo of the hand in the office if you want a look. It must have been a big night? - Yeah. The next day he bought this place. It must have been a fixed deck. You mean Charley dealt him a cold hand? It figures. Come here. Huh? Come here. What? You're fired. Shush. Eighteen. Mr Kyng. Do you want me, Mr Kyng? - No. [ Telephone ] It's all very exciting, but why the mystery? The way I walked in hiding all this stuff in my pockets. I'm sure they thought I was a gangster or something. I'm sorry Doc, but I didn't want anybody to know. Here or at home. That is why I phoned from outside. And that is why I went to that specialist out of town. You didn't even tell Lon? Why throw a scare into her? There is nothing the matter with me. What did this specialist say? Oh, he had a fancy Latin name for it. But he is wrong. He has got to be wrong. Why did you go to him in the first place? Well, just a few pains. Where? Here. This way? Or this way? This way. How'd it feel? Like a hand grabbed me. Couldn't breathe? That's right. - Uhuh. Ed, it's just that I am out of shape. Too much of this and that. You know. Unbutton your shirt. By the way. What was this Latin name he mentioned? Angina pecto .. Pectoris. Well. Maybe it doesn't sound like a Swiss movement. No. It is no Swiss movement. Button your shirt. I got a cabinet full of liquor too. A short one? Thanks. Give. What is this angina pectoris? It is a cardiac condition. Induced by too much tension. Break that down. A bad heart. Caused by a disturbance of the circulation. Lots of people have it, Charley. Football players, boxers, businessmen. Women who nag and holler too much. But why me? Too much tension. Most people have one or two crises a year. You have them 20-30 times a night. How long have I got? Stop feeling sorry for yourself. I've got patients with worse pumps than yours who are 90 years old. Odds are 4-1 you'll lick the government for another 20 years of old age pension. If? What is the "if"? If you give all this up and take it easy. Suppose I don't? - Why not? You've got enough money. Quit. Go away. Change your pace for the first time in your life. Be a spectator. - But if I don't? You had better get that prescription filled. Nitroglycerin tablets. One 200th of a grain. When you get one of those pains put one of them under your tongue. Nitro ..? Too much of anything will kill. The right amount will help. Moderation, my boy. That is the secret of a long life. Doc. It took me twenty years to get here. They said I'd never do it alone. But I did. I am here. On top. - That's the time to quit. It only needs one bad night. Somebody gets lucky, starts to break you. You fight him. You have got to. All it takes is one night like that. I guess you know all the things you are not supposed to do. I expect you and Lon and Paul to go away. Not later. Tonight. Don't ever come back here. Well? What you are saying is that if I give up living .. I'll live. That's right. If not for yourself at least do it for Lon and Paul. Goodnight. And be a good boy. So long, Doc. Hello. Why? Unless I hire people I don't like them working here. You understand? Sure. Goodnight. Charley. Want to okay this? Who is he? - Some business in Ohio. Who recommended him? - He came in with 14 carat on him. I don't want that hustler in business. We had to fire Smitty. We did? - Yeah. He talks too much. A very dangerous disease. How is it going, Danny? - Evening, Mr Kyng. Just the same. We had more than we could handle on Yellow Jacket Fairground. We laid off. - Did he win? He ran out. Say, Mr Kyng. That woman down there. She's got me worried. She's been sitting just like that ever since the last track closed. How's it going, Miss? Some days, a fellow can't pick a winner all year. Some days. It is getting late, Miss. You ought to be going home. I can't. I lost all my money. And when my husband finds out .. I can't go home. He doesn't know I come to places like this and if he did .. He wouldn't understand. Even I don't. My ring. I pawned it. I had a hunch today. Miracle Lad. Listen, mister. I got to have ninety dollars. To get my wedding ring back. I have got to. I'll do anything. Please. Please, mister. Money across the board. Suppose Miracle Lad won instead of Dingbat? How much would it come to? A hundred and ten. - Let me have it. He's a nut when it comes to human dignity. They made a mistake. Miracle Lad won. From now on, I'd keep that wedding ring on my finger. How could they make a mistake like that? It might happen to anybody. You know what, mister? I'm going to take my business someplace else and I advise you to do the same. That is a good idea. And I am going to check every result in the morning paper too. You do that. Goodnight, Mr Kyng. Goodnight, Danny. There's something I had to tell you but .. I have forgotten it. That's okay. You ain't mad at me? What for? - I thought you was mad at me. You want to be careful. You got this sick look. You get some rest. Go fishing maybe. Up north like you said. We'll catch those big son-of-a-guns. I won't rock the boat. I'll watch out. Yeah. You got to watch out. Fine fishing weather alright. Yeah. Fine. Oh, I remember. Mrs Kyng phoned. You was upstairs so I didn't call you. She is worried about you. Never mind that now. - Okay. Here. You ain't mad at me? No. I ain't mad at you. Hello? Lon? Yes. Hello, darling. No, no. There is nothing wrong here. It's you I was worried about. One of the boys called and wanted to know where you were so .. Oh, I see. Uhuh. You are sure you are alright? Sure now? No. Paul is going to the Freshman Prom. Me? Of course not. He is taking a nice young girl he can neck with after the dance. For sure, he necks. Charley. You sure everything is alright? Me? What am I going to do? The same as I always do. Wait for you. See you in the morning. Night. [ Radio: ] "Yes, sir." "Maid and butler service for one full year."

Thanks. - Alright. Alice. - Yep? How is Robbie feeling? - He'll live. Charley says he doesn't have to work if he doesn't feel better. Robbie? He doesn't have any feelings. Where did you go? Out in the rain with my secret lover. Funny. Very funny. The phone rang. Who was on the phone? Maybe it was for me. - Who'd call you? Some people know I am alive. - I'll page you. I don't feel good. I am sick, I tell you. - Then stay home. Charley says if you don't feel good stay home. Charley says .. Charley says! Who cares what Charley says? - Then quit working for him. Just like that? What about the money? Then don't quit. Funny. Very funny. Standing on my feet all night working the crap tables. All night. What do I get out of it? Peanuts. He gets all the gravy. I am sick I tell you. A lot you care. Alice. Did you ask Lon? About the money, I mean. No. She'll give it to you. Charley will never even know about it. I won't ask her. Why not? She is your sister. That is why not. Because she is my sister. Make sense will you. Because she is my sister, Charley gave you a job. Let's you live in this house. Let's you eat at his table. Let's you pretend you are a man. When you are not. Whose feelings are you afraid to hurt? Lon's or Charley's? I've got have that $2,000. I tell you I've got to have it. Please, honey. Just this once, huh? [ Doorbell ] Somebody is at the door. Somebody is here. [ Doorbell ] Mrs Elcott? No. I am Mrs Kyng. Sorry to bother you. Robbie .. Mr Elcott. He is expecting us. Well, he doesn't feel well. That's too bad. Robbie don't feel good. - Then he is home, huh? You see, we are his friends. From way back. - Yeah. That's right. From way back. I am Lew Debretti. This is Frank Sistina. How do you do. - Pleased to meet you. If it's not too much trouble Mrs Kyng, I wonder of you'd tell Robbie we're here. You see, he wants to see us. Awful bad. Yeah. That is right. He says for you to come up. You got a nice place here, Mrs Kyng. Mrs Elcott? First door to the left. - Thanks. Thanks a lot. Nice. - Yeah. Class. - Yeah. Hiya, Robbie. How is the boy? Not so good. I am sick. Very sick. - Sorry to hear it. Have you got it? You shouldn't have come here. Since you lost the money we never hear from you. Not even a jingle. So we have to come here. We ain't got any pride. Have you got it? The cash? No. I tried everywhere. Everywhere. $2,000 is a lot of dough. You got to give me more time. You got to. Baby, I'd like to but .. - We can't. We got bills too. You said tonight. Tomorrow. Give me until tomorrow. That's what you said yesterday. And the day before. And the day before that. Right! Mint? A fellow like you. The friends you got. The racket you are in. What is a few thousand dollars? It is no use. Go ahead, do what you want. It's no use. You got the wrong idea, baby. Things aren't that bad. The fact is, we got a way for you to square things. Surprised you didn't think of it yourself. Yeah. That's right. I'm surprised you didn't think of it yourself. You work the crap table at Charley Kyng's don't you? Where are you, on the mop? Work for the rate twenty minutes, steal twenty minutes. We shift around. It is four on a table. Work an hour and rest 20 minutes. - Uhuh. When you are on the stick, you handle the dice. Yeah. - Well? Well? Winning dice? I can't. They'd spot me. Got another way? Charley would kill me if he found out. It will be all over before anybody finds out. We win $4,000 in one roll and King's walk out. Four? Three for us and one for you. You don't owe us any more money. Nobody is the wiser and nobody gets hurt. Except Charley Kyng. Yes. Except Charley. Then your credit at our place is good again. Yeah, that is right. We'll be there at nine. I said I wouldn't be in tonight on account of I don't feel so good. But now you feel better, don't you. Sure he does. So, it is tonight. Okay? Here. Here. That will get you in. - Uhuh. Your wife. She is nice. Is she? You got to get yourself a day job, baby. Here. Take 'em. It is good for your breath. What's the use of kidding myself, Ma? She stood me up. That's all. But if she has a cold? Goodnight, Mrs Kyng. - Yeah. Goodnight. Goodnight. You mustn't believe that, Paul. You can't expect her to go out in this weather. She found out who I am. That is the end of it. What do you mean, who you are? Ah, we are famous alright. Everybody talks about the notorious Kyng family. Only in whispers. I don't blame her for breaking the date. Not when we entertain friends like those two men. They were here to see Robbie. Uncle Robbie. I am real proud of him. You can't go to the Prom alone. Don't worry, mom. I found just the girl for me. Nobody else would ask her out. So, chances are she won't ask me who my father is. I am going in. I feel a lot better now. What did your friends do, operate? [ Door knocks ] Hi. - Hi. Hi, Sis. What are you doing home? I saw a light in the window and figured it was for me. Here. Robbie. Anybody ever tell you to get yourself a day job? Want me to call Lon? - No. Not yet. Are you staying home tonight? Is that so unusual? - No, no. Well, it is. - That's right It is. I mean I think it's swell. You've been working too hard lately. A night off now and then .. Well. Goodnight. Terrific, huh? - What's it for? Stream trout. I haven't seen a trout around here for days. Tent, ax, angling outfit. Boy scout knife. The whole works. We're going fishing. Goodnight. Lon, me and the kid. How about a little drink to celebrate? - Not for me, thanks. Just one for the road? No thank you, You go ahead. How about a cigarette then? - No thanks. No more drinking, no more smoking? What are you going to give up next? I need the flies. I had a whole box full of them. You seen them? Flies. Flies. Hooks with feathers on them. Unwrap those, will you. Yeah. What's all this? What you been dreaming about? Here. Drink this. It will give your eyes an extra-special droopy look. He is down in the basement looking for flies. It has something to do with fishing. [ Crashing noise! ] There goes our athlete. Did the closet attack you? Yeah. Right to my face. Maybe it thought you were a stranger. Don't you ever throw anything away? - Never. The same old shoes, old hats. Old ideas. Old husbands. What you said to Alice. Is it true? We're going to the mountains? - Sure it's true. You know you have been working too hard. That's why you need a vacation? - Okay. Tomorrow morning we leave. On the level? If .. we can find those flies. Charley. What is this? A memory room. One box of flies bought for a fishing trip in 1932. We never went. Hmm. World series. That's where we spent your honeymoon. Watching Pepper Martin steal bases. Who won? I don't know who won the series but you won a lot of money. Mine? When you were a bartender. [ Music ] From 321 Beecher Street? Uhuh. Third floor rear. I went back and got it. The same spring. But why? I don't know. It's the only room in the house where I .. I don't know. Sometimes, I .. I come here and make believe. Make believe what? That we are back at 321 Beecher Street. Angry? You like fishing? I don't know. - Like me? I don't remember. Now I remember. So what do you do when I am not around? Get all dolled up and go out and do a little flirting. Any success? Enough. Who would go out with an old married woman? It happens every day. Don't you read the papers? Nice. When you are here it is. Any regrets because we are still not on Beecher Street? You mean, do I wish we were broke? Behind on the rent. And did our own laundry. And had to have my baby at home instead of a hospital. It sounds very romantic. It was. As a memory, I mean. No complaints, huh? Plenty of them. Name a hundred. The hundred nights you weren't here when I wanted you. Oh, sharp. Want to use my shirt studs? - No thanks. How about one of these home-made steaks? You know why the best cooks are skinny? Neither do I. The same reason that good barbers are bald, I guess. Sure you won't change your mind about one of these? I'm eating out. Mum tell you about the fishing party? Kinda sudden, isn't it? No. Not exactly. Been wanting to do it for twenty years. We'll go up in them Rockies. Stay for a week. Maybe a month. Then what? Back here to the same thing? Alright, kid. Let's have it. What's your beef? Nothing. It's sticking out all over you. Bring it out into the open. What is it this time? - Nothing new. The gambling, huh? It doesn't fit with your idea of an old man, does sit. But it buys you clothes and gets you the things you want. At least you don't have to get out and scratch for it like a lot of kids do. Since when is money so indecent? It is how you get it. I see. What do you know about money? Any kind? Except how to spend it. Alright. I don't know much. But a lot of people agree with me. Paul, grow up. You're a big boy now. Something is wrong between us. If it's not the gambling, what is it? Let me tell you something about gambling. Do you know how many decks of cards were bought last year? Over sixty million. And more than five million pair of dice. I didn't use all of them. Believe me. More than half the people gamble. And I didn't force one, not one, to come to my place. Over six billion was bet on the horses last year. Seventy million collected in taxes from racetracks. Legally. You can buy horse-racing shares of stock legally. People gamble on .. Bridge, football, fights. Poker, the lottery. The weather. There's pinball machines, punch-board, bingo. In this town gambling is open. If you don't gamble you might say you are not supporting your city government. In some places you can even place a bet as to how long you are going to live. Wrong? Maybe it is. But I am not smart enough to judge over half the population. Honest, kid. I don't think you are old enough to judge your father. I'll make the check out to cash. But you should have phone before you came. Every nickel we got in the world. 1,200 dollars. Now, what are we going to do? What? I don't know anything about it, Mrs Lorgan. I swear it. On my father's grave, I swear it. Tell her, Larry. Tell her. Tell her what? This is my husband, Mrs Lorgan. Tell her what, Larry? I didn't know you were home, mister. - I'm sure you didn't. But you took all our money. You had no right. We can't afford it. Mrs Lorgan, you shouldn't have come here. You are making it impossible for him and .. For everybody. Give the money back, mister. You cheated him. Now give it back. Get out! Take her and get out! I'll go to the police. I'll tell them what kind of a place you run. I can tell them plenty, but plenty. Go to the police. Go any place you want. But you shouldn't have come here. Just as I wouldn't come crying to you if my husband lost his money. Oh sure. You are rich. Why should you cry? - You had better go. Cheat! You live in a fancy neighborhood in a fine big house. But you're a disgrace. That's what you are. A disgrace. Thanks. You said the right thing. Did I? That doesn't stop it from happening, does it. It won't ever happen again. Because. When we go away in the morning maybe we will .. When you leave tomorrow don't wait for me. Paul. Paul. Lon, listen. Maybe by the time we get back .. - I can't go. Not now. Not with him feeling this way. You have got to. I can't. I can't. Come on. Come on, come on. What are you going to do? Go back to the place. - Do you want to? Why not? Paul. He is just a kid. He doesn't know any better. Everything is going to turn out alright. Want a bet? Don't you trust me? Yes, certainly. But you set the limit yourself. I'm good for it. You ought to know that. - Take it easy, Mr Kulik. Well, don't treat me like I was a little boy or something. I felt better so I came in. What's the matter? Can't you can hello? Hello. Hello, Ada. You've been away. I read you got a divorce. How come I attract nothing but lemons? Good evening, Mr Robbie. - Oh, shut up. Good evening, Mr Kurstyn. Yeah. Just going to wash little bad luck off my hands. Yes, sir. Aren't you Charley's brother-in-law? - That's right, Mr Kurstyn. Where is Charley? - He went home. Ah, that's too bad. I wanted him to watch me break the bank. Let us hope so. I mean, why not? If anybody can do it you can do it. Yeah. - Good luck. Yes. Oh .. Charley. Hello Charley. It's me. Ben Snelerr. Well? I get to know all the back entrances. How is it Ben? - Fine, fine. Just fine. You? So, so. Do you want to see me? Well, it will just take a minute. Why not wait in the joint? I telephoned and they said you were home. So I said, when would you be back and they said not tonight. I said to myself: Charley not coming in on a Saturday night? You couldn't keep him away. Not Charley. Not with real action. So I .. just waited. Help yourself, Ben. You know where it is. Thanks. Thanks, Charley. Still selling insurance? Oh no, no. I haven't got enough relatives to make a go of that. Besides, that took so much of my time. How much do you need this time, Ben? Now look. I don't want you to think every time I come around here that I .. You know. There's no-one else I'd rather be with. How much? - Well .. No handout this time. I've got collateral. Here is a little .. Something that was .. Left over from the old days. From Imogene. Yeah. She was my wife. Remember? It's a beauty alright. 500 enough? Oh, that is fine. That is just fine. I knew this was my day when I got up this morning. I knew it. You did, Ben? How? How did you know? I guess I just felt it. That is it. I felt it. How does it feel? How? Well, like .. You know. Like you couldn't lose? - Yeah. That's it. Like I couldn't lose. When I saw your car pull up tonight I said to myself, I said Ben .. They can't stop you. Here is where you make your comeback. Not so big at first but .. Big enough. When old lady luck starts to turn they can't stop you. You will understand if I say I don't want your business tonight, Ben. Oh, I am not going to play this against the house. Oh, you .. You don't think I'd buck you with your own money? Poker. You know, I .. I got a strange feeling about poker tonight just like you used to have. You Know. You and me, we are a lot alike. Yeah. I guess so, Ben. Thanks. Here is to your health. Thanks. [ Door knocks ] Hello. Excuse me. - That's alright, Miss. I was just leaving. See you. Thanks. Charley, what's the matter? I'll call somebody. You sure you are alright now? Sure. You were kidding me, weren't you? That's right. Gee honey, you had me scared. Real scared. Is that all? I couldn't get any wrong ideas out of that either. You've been faithful twenty years. That's a long rap. Suppose I asked you to go away with me. Tonight. Right now. No questions asked. Would you go? Are you asking me? No. Suppose I were to ask you to go away with me tonight? Right now. No questions asked. Would you go? Gee honey, I've been waiting for this a long time. A long time. Is that why you got married three times? Four. But it never worked out. You should have seen them. They all kind-of looked a little bit like you. But. Gee, don't take it so hard. I know how I rate. All I ask is for you to let me love you. Any contributions will be gratefully accepted. Okay. So you love your wife. I want my kid to like me. Why is it I can get along with everybody except my own kid? It's true, at first I didn't want a kid but he was too young to know that. Sometimes kids don't have to understand things to feel them. I was ashamed to wheel him in his carriage. You know how it is: a big guy like me behind a buggy. It wouldn't look right. Now she shies away from me like .. - Maybe now he is ashamed of you. Gee, I didn't mean anything. Lots of kids are ashamed of their folks. Either because they are too poor or they don't speak good English or .. Because they are gamblers. Like me? But why? If I had disgraced him or hurt him .. I take a few bucks, see. Me, a nobody. And run it into a battle in the roughest, toughest race of them all .. Where you don't get any second guesses. I build a legit business. A reputation. Nobody can point a finger at Charley Kyng and say he didn't pay off. Nobody can say they didn't get a fair shake. Me, who couldn't spit in the same ocean with some people. Now they are proud to know me. I've built a place where I am as good as anybody. Better. - Please, Charley. Please. What is a good father supposed to do? I never forgot the kid's birthday or Christmas presents. He went to the best summer camps, the best schools. Got him an automobile. I don't know. Anything he wanted. Except. Except maybe yourself. Don't get mad, Charley. Maybe he wants something you didn't learn how to give. Gee, Charley. You sure you are alright now? Sure. What was the matter? Too much tension. It's like always coming to bat with the bases loaded. Oh. You have the wrong address, gentlemen. - Have we George? Have we George? - Sorry, gentlemen. How is business, George? Well, sir. Business ain't my business. My name ain't George. - Huh? What is it, George? It's "Sleigh". Like you use in the snow. Sleigh. You slay me, George. Yeah. You going to take us for a sleigh-ride, George? Here is your two bits, George. No tipping allowed, gentlemen. That's the trouble. You take a porter off a train and right away he don't like the name George. Yeah. That is the trouble. Here. Make a bet. I have never bet like this in my life. Well, it is about time you got started. Go ahead. The ball is rolling. 23. Red. What did I tell you? Everybody wins their first bet. That's the rule. Right, Pete? I guess so. Cash them please. I couldn't stand it again. Charley, if I were you I'd close up right now. The luck is on the side of the angels tonight. Joe just bet a 50-cent check and took you for 17 and a half. Is it alright if I quit? That makes you the smartest gambler in the place. Yes, Mr Kyng? - You know. Come on, come on. I thought you were staying home tonight. - I am home. Your lawyer called about the income tax. I told him you'd check with him later. I got hold of that forty tons of coal and sent it out like you said. Oh, two checks bounced. The two sportsmen from Philly. Call Manzetti in South Philly. The same percentage if he collects. - Right. We bought a hundred tickets for the policeman's ball. Ten bucks a throw. Say, do those guys really dance? How do I know? In all the years of buying tickets I never yet saw a ticket. Call it. Call. Ace high flush. Thanks. How is the dice tonight? Hot or cold? I never touch them Mrs Calbern. Charley. Sarah. How is my lover? You are looking younger all the time. Well the point is, am I young enough? Hello. I'm speaking to the Country Club? Put Mr Reardon on. Hello. Hello, Charley. Fine, fine. How is yourself? Your kid? I guess so. Well, the place is jumping with education tonight. Make something special for him? Yep. I understand. Yep. Just leave it to me, Charley. Anything for a friend. Goodbye. So I told him, listen coach. You get ten thousand a year and I get fifty bucks a week. I make the touchdowns and you sit on the bench and pray. Hold it, Sleigh. What is that? Drinking stuff? It ain't ketchup. Who is it going to? - The Ra-Ra named Paul Kyng. Compliments of his old man. Some old man. Okay, half-back. You'll get penalised for holding. Paul Kyng? - Yes. Compliments of your father. I am going to like him. Want me to serve it? - No thanks. Education. That was very thoughtful. - Yeah. It took a lot of effort to pick up a phone and order it. My father never did it. Let's dance. What you said before. Don't you like your father? Of course. Everybody likes his father. I don't. That's an awful thing to say. You don't understand. I love him but I don't like him. What is that supposed to mean? Well, some things he does are just swell. But some things are .. Well, you see no matter what you try to do he can do it better. I mean, well .. When I was very little we were great friends. Until one day. I was about 7 or 8. A kid on the block punched me. I ran home balling. My father asked if I'd hit the kid back. I said no. Pa said I had to hit him back. I said I couldn't. Pa got down on his knees. That made him littler than me. Hit me, he said. I couldn't. Hit me! But I couldn't. And then he slapped me. Not hard. Just hard enough so that I would hit back. Then both of us were crying and he was saying hit me, hit me, but I couldn't. Anyway, we were never really friends after that. Hi. The name is Mike. - Glad to meet you. My name is .. Everybody knows Charley Kyng's son. Meet Tommy Smith. Beta epsilon. The is Helen .. - Look, Paul. This dance might be alright but .. I said, this is Helen Mitchell. Glad to meet you. - Miss Mitchell. Look. This kind of stuff is okay for kids but .. We got other ideas. Right, Tommy? We thought we might go somewhere more .. Interesting. - Like your old man's joint. We understand we must be known to get in. How about it, huh? Maybe shoot a little dice, have some fun? No. If it's because you didn't called to the Frat .. I won't take you. What's the matter? Aren't we good enough for your old man's clip-joint? Sit down! I'm talking to you so answer. Hit him, Paul. Hit him. Yeah, hit me, Paul. Hit me. Let him alone. - Let him alone. Hey, cut it out! Kids. I am the manager. 34 red. 34 red. Here you are, young man. Thank you. He is not the old Ben. - What's the matter, Ben? Chuck Robinson just bluffed him out of a big pot. Would you believe it? On a night like this Ellen leaves the hotel. You'd better go find her. I'll take the book. Where would I look? Maybe she went to a movie. Come on, baby. Come on baby. Little Joe, Little Joe. Talk to me baby. Four. The winner. Pay him off on the line. Coming up for a new point. Who is the Sharpie? Better get on the phone, and find Ellen. Four. The point is four. Mark it, dealer. Time for a little come back. 7-1. 7-1 on the hard way. Say Charley, you had better stick around and watch yourself go broke. This fellow has made six passes. No use talking now. Come on, baby. Little Joe. Little Joe. Talk to me baby. Four. The winner. Sorry. You are pretty lucky. Yeah. Well, take a little, leave a little. - Maybe you're right. How .. Long have you known Robbie? Robbie? Who is that? The first time I ever saw a winner quit before his roll was over. Say Charley, you know what? What? - I got a hunch. Tonight, I'm going to take you for every nickel you've got. You are, Jim? - Yes. And you know what? - What? I am going to be glad when you are broke. I know that, Jim. And you are going to break down just like everybody else does. Like the time you did? And you know another thing? When you come begging for a break. I'm not going to give it to you. That is no more than I would expect from you, Jim. Do you mind if I raise the limit? To what? Say, five hundred? Or are you playing it safe? Ed. Raise Mr Kurstyn's limit to five hundred. Right. Thanks. It's only money. Yeah. Gentlemen, what are you drinking? - We have ordered. Say. They tell me this fellow Kurstyn owns half the cars and oil in the west. Is that on the level? - It could be. What's your line of business? - Why .. Why? Hey, help! Somebody. Somebody. A man trying to kill himself. Ben. Charley. It's alright, gentlemen. Nothing at all. It's perfectly alright. I had the winning hand. But I didn't have the guts. And then when they laughed at me .. I didn't even have what it takes to kill myself. What's happened to me, Charley? What's Happened to me? You lost a hand at poker. That's all. Take him to a hotel. Stay with him. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir? Yes, sir. I got that part fine but .. Yes, sir. But what was it about? Hello? Hello? Mr Kyng. Get rid of Ben's gun. - I thought you had it. Take a look in there. Yes? Mr Kyng, the phone was calling you. It seemed like everything was going along fine. Dancing. Music playing. A nice time. Then wham. A riot. Cops. Millions of them. Everybody lands in the jug. What are you talking about? - That's what he told me. Who? - I don't know. So what I wanted to ask you was, do you want me to go and get him out of jail? Who? - Your kid. Paul? In jail? - That's what he told me. Kensington prison. A nice jail alright. What did he do? What happened? - A fight. The man said, on account of you. Get my coat. Guess what? My kid Paul is in jail. Slugged a guy on account of me. A real fight, eh? - A regular riot. That's what he told him. Hello, Sarge. Hello. What is it all about? How many kids you got in there? - You know as much about it as I do. Anybody important? No matter who is in jail. He is important. Alright, Joe. Keeping them in after school, Sarge? Hey Sarge, can I go home and get dressed formally too? Alright, fellahs. You are going to have to stay with us for a short while. In the meantime, if there is somebody you want me to notify .. Your parents or .. Maybe some friend. Just give me their names and phone numbers. I'd like you call my old man. Switzer 6200. How long are we going to be in here? - Well, that I couldn't tell you. Just call my old man. Switzer 6200. But doctor, how do you think I ought to handle him? You know him better than I do. Get him out of that place and keep him out. Thanks. [ Telephone ] Forget it. Goodnight, Alice. - Goodnight. Hello? Yes. This is Mrs Kyng. Police? Who? Paul? I see. Yes, Sergeant I understand. Thank you. Yes. Right away and thank you. You'd better stay here in case the phone rings. I'm going out. Where I go every night. Three Martinis and little Alice is in wonderland. Why? It makes me forget I am married to Robbie. Did you know he has been stealing from Charley for years? I know. Not much. Just a few dollars a night. Robbie is a small-time gambler. He is a small-time cheat and a small-time man. He never does anything good enough for me to love him and .. Nothing bad enough for me to leave him. You are going to Paul aren't you? Yes. He is jealous of Charley. So is Robbie. Want a laugh? I am jealous of you. I know that too. Do you know how much he needs somebody? Somebody with no ifs, ands, or buts. Somebody who is not afraid to stand up and admit she is .. I am that somebody. Charley and me had a lucky accident. No marriage that lasts as long as ours happens just by luck. I know my husband better than anybody else. We've made mistakes, sure. Who hasn't? It's easy to get married. It takes know-how to make it stick. And I know how. And I intend to do what it takes. And it is not by crying in my beer either. Why don't the colleges teach respect? Let me say if I don't get damages they will learn respect in the penitentiary. Where they will have plenty of time .. Hello Charley. Did you get my call? I tried to keep your kid out of it. The police have no respect. I got a boy here, Sergeant. Paul Kyng. Could you release him please? I am afraid with the kind of charges brought by Mr Reardon here the .. Not against you, Charley. I swear his kid didn't do a thing. Nothing. I swear it. I know it's a little out of order, sir but if I took care of the damages .. I swear I had no intention of .. - How much? Well, counting one chandelier, one saxophone. And glasses. You know how hard it is to get glasses these days. How much? Say, 800 dollars? This will release all the kids, won't it? Unless there are charges by some of the boys. Thanks, Charley. Now I repeat, I had no intention .. - Could I get my boy now please? Mr Kyng, is this the first time you .. - Not now, please. Just a minute, Mr Reardon. Sign this release first. Mr Kyng. Yep? About your boy. What is it? What is the matter? He thought you might be along so .. He said .. He said that he didn't want to see you or for you to take him home. He said that .. Excuse me. Yes, Captain? No, no. The only report we have is .. And I can easily send it right along to you. I could check the State record. Alright. Yes, I will put it on the Teletype for you. I'm sorry, Charley. Nothing personal, you understand. But after all .. The fight. What was it about? I swear your kid didn't start anything. - What happened? It was something about you. Some smart-aleck called you names. I don't know. Your kid .. - Hit him? Paul hit him, didn't he? Didn't he? - No, I swear he didn't. I saw everything myself. This other kid knocked him down but your boy, he's a gentleman. He .. he has got respect. Respect for other people. He is a real gentleman. Kettering, okay. Timpson, okay. Eubank, okay. Is this why I sent you to college? Hiya, Ma. - "Hiya Ma", you. I couldn't help it. Somebody hit me. Stewart, okay. Henley, okay. Leveson, okay. Kyng, okay. Addison, okay. Which one of them is Charley Kyng's kid? - He's just leaving. Sorry. Excuse me. Are you Mrs Charley Kyng? No. Yes. I am Mrs Charley Kyng. What about it? Nothing. Just that I never knew there was a Mrs Kyng. I mean .. - Now you know it. Would you say the boy was a chip off the old block? I hope so. Is it true you tried to bribe a football player? - No, sir. Is it true you and your father tried ..? - Stop reaching, mister. It'll make a good story anyway. No it won't. Because it's not true. I never meant to let you in for anything like this. I'm glad it happened. How does it feel being blamed for a thing you didn't do? It wouldn't have happened .. - It's always happening. If you wear overalls you are supposed to be stupid. If you own a bank they say you are a thief. For everybody who is different there is a dirty name. You don't stop it by hiding in a memory room or by running away either. You fight it. Cab! Where are we going? First to get you cleaned up and then to get acquainted with your father. Eleven is the winner. Can't lose. Not tonight. Kiss them, sweetheart. - You bet. Come along Papa, Come to me eleven. Seven, winner. Hey, Charley. Where is Charley somebody? Five. Five is the point. Five! Little baby from the south. Come on, baby. Five, the winner. - Five! That's it! Once more. - Two! Nine is the point. - Nine. I'll make it the hard way. We're running out of chips. Do you know how much he is ahead, Kurstyn? Mr Kyng ain't here right now. You might look in his office though. Hello, Lon. - Hello. How is Ellen? - Fine. Still a little crazy but fine. You remember Paul? The last time I saw you, you were this big. Remember the Christmas dinner out at your house? Yeah, I guess so. - So you are Charley's kid. Mr Kyng's kid? - Yep. Really? Sure. You even look like him. Mr Kyng, he says you're going to be the best lawyer ever. Sure, the one thing we need. A mouthpiece. Sleigh. Why don't you show Paul around? Sure. Come along. Surprised? - A little. So you are Mr Kyng's kid? Well, well. Mr Kyng said you and him are going fishing. And catch those big son-of-a-guns. You fish as good as him? - No. Well, he'll teach you. Well, well. So you are Mr Kyng's kid. Miss Sarah, look who is here. Mr Kyng's kid. Young man. Come here. You are going to look as good. But the point is. Will you be as good? Can't you talk yet? Yes. - Good. Play poker? - No, ma'am. Don't you know how? - I don't believe in it. You don't believe? What do you winners believe in? I'm not sure. In that case, perhaps there is still hope for you. Go away now. My next question is more embarrassing. I don't know. He left here to pick up Paul. What does he usually do around this time? Fancy a bite in the restaurant? Thanks. That silly old woman. Who is she? Her father practically founded this town. She's number two in the hit parade of the 400. She plays poker like a fiend and always wins. Where is .. Pa? Say it: where is Pa? Where is Pa? And don't ever forget it. Mr Kyng, you are late tonight. And what have we got? The best lobster all season. Just some coffee. They are looking for you inside. They said if you come to .. Your card tricks are better. Lon. The trick where you throw a playing card over a 4-storey building. A tycoon told me about it. That got me the rep as being the strongest man in town. With the help of a narrow alley and a terrific updraft .. Between 1 and 2 in the afternoon anybody can do it. But I found out about it first. You and Columbus. Drink your coffee. Paul alright? He is in there. What did you do, stick a gun in his back? What you said before. About going away. Let's go. Tonight if you like. What changed your mind? I found out how much I love you. What else did you find out? It's not as bad as you think. I am a very selfish woman, darling. If anything happened to you. I would be the big loser. And Paul? I was a wife before I was a mother. Fortunately. Let's walk out that door and never come back. We've got enough money to take it easy for a long time, haven't we. Only if we live lavishly. Good evening. - Hi. You'd better come in right away. Them two Sharpies? - Jim Kurstyn. Bad? Either you close the game now or you and Ben Snelerr can play duets. Coming? In a minute. Don't go, Charley. Whatever they win, let them have it. Close the game. It was never closed when I was winning. Why close it when I am losing? This is a fine time to think about ethics. It is easy to have ethics when you are ahead of the game. A funny thing. All my life I've tried to play it smart. Keep the percentages working for me. Do you know why most people lose in a gambling house? They play too long. Even the house can lose I guess, if it plays too long. Want me to come with you? Half the money riding in there is yours, you know. Let it ride. Well. If we lose I can always go back to being the strongest man in town. See you. How much is he ahead? That much? Can we cover it? - Maybe. Checked the dice? - Ten times. I saw Robbie bring in some bad dice. He's working with the Sharpies. The dice are okay now. - Maybe. But the bad ones started the run. Charley! Hey Charley. Come on in. The water is fine. Want some advice? No. - Close the game. Get out with half a skin. Nobody will blame you. Gentlemen. Will you get us some cigarettes? - What kind? Any kind. Just cigarettes. Okay, George. How much longer we got to wait? Shush. He's back. Charley. He is back! So? You got your money. Why don't you go? What you hanging around for? It's not a free country anymore. I want my end of the take. You promised me. Don't worry. You'll get yours. Now take a walk. Yeah. Sure. Funny about that guy Kurstyn winning on the level, isn't it. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Pa. Hello, kid. Better close that door. When you came for me at the jail. The reason I didn't want to see you was .. Something happened at the dance. Forget it, You are out. That is all that matters. That man, Mr Kurstyn. He says he is going to break you. He might. I watched him play. Him and the others. Nice people. But they hate you. And each other. Everyone has got a little hate in them. This is one way to get rid of it. Stop the game. Give them back their money. Do you want to change the world? Okay, change it. Make it over your way. That is your privilege. And if I am still around when you have got it. Give me the rules and I will try to live by them. Right now I am living in this world and these rules I know. You play for keeps and you play to win. And if you lose, you start over again. Charley! Here is my pal, Charley! Hiya, Charley. How is it, Jim? - It's Christmas. Paying off and closing the game? No. Just using cash. Sometimes a fellow plays so long he forgets the chips count for real money. But .. what if I quit? That would make you a smarter gambler than I think you are. Changing the dice? Why? They treating you bad? No, no. Stick man. Ed is the best we've got. Place your bets Coming out for a new number. Seven. The winner. Winner on the line. Two hundred and one dollars. Coming out for a new number. Where have you been all night? You're my lucky piece. I've been telling you that for years. - That's right. He has. Too bad I got to take it away from you in dribbles. Well, make it easy on me. The limit is off. Anything? Anything I can cover. Can't you make him quit, Mrs Kyng? He'll lose everything. How does five thousand make you feel? Roll 'em. Read them and weep. Nine is the point. Can I back it up? Sure. - How much? Whatever you've got on the line. The bet. Roll 'em. Six. The big six. Your point is nine. Eight. The big eight. Your point is nine. Crap. Your point is nine. Four. Nine is the point. You had better get all the cash you've got, honey. He is going to need it. Winner nine. - It's my night, Charley. May I use your phone? - Sure. Telephone book, young man? - Yes, ma'am. I don't have my glasses with me. Look up Sam Webson, my lawyer. - Yes, ma'am. Some place on South Briar Avenue. Don't you know that coffee makes you nervous? Unless it has brandy in it. Pardon me. Pardon me. Bring everybody a drink. Well, ready to quit? That would make Willy very unhappy. Still tough, huh? No. But you won't quit. No. You think you are better at this than I am. I didn't say that. No, but you think it. How does it feel playing against your own money? Does it scare you .. just a little bit? You thought about being broke? You are not far from it now. That is the big difference between us. I've been broke before. You haven't. Finished eating? You are costing Willy money. Coming out for a number. Roll 'em. Come on, seven. Four. Easy four. Four is the number. Four is the number. Mark the four. Six. The big six. Six. The big six. The point is four. Come on, little Joe. Eight. The point is four. You tell Sam Webson this will not wait until tomorrow. Go on, wake him up. No amount of sleep will make him beautiful anyhow. What's your name again? - Paul. Can you drive a car? - Yes, ma'am. Well, that's about all the atomic age can do. I want you to go and get some money for your father. Are you Charley's kid? We haven't made up our minds yet. Hello, Sam? This is Sarah. What are you doing in bed at this ridiculous hour? How much money have you got in the house? I know the banks are closed. I need more than that. Much more. I am not kidnapped. And I have never been drunk in my life. I happen to be in a high-class crap game. It's a four! That was a nice gesture, Miss Sarah. He needs cash, not gestures. Would you mind telling me why you want to help people? You probably won't understand. Because you never had one. But I consider myself your father's friend. If I were only fifteen years younger. Why does Jim Kurstyn like to gamble with your father? Because he knows Charley Kyng is the toughest competition he can find. What do they prove with dice? Maybe themselves. Coming out. Let 'em roll. Craps. Ace deuce. A loser. Craps two sixes. A loser. Feel it coming, Jim? Change the dice. They're cold. Put them down. I said put them down. How much have I got here? Ed. Tycoon. Size it up. That's all your money. And these dice are cold. Ice cold. Maybe. They are through passing for me. And that's what you have been waiting for. My luck to turn. Quitting? Just switching. I'm betting all this .. Against the dice. On the 'Don't Pass'. That makes you root for a seven and I am through making seven. Taking the bet? Or are you quitting? Charley. Charley. What's the matter? What happened? See .. see if I can cover it. This covers all but 400. Your credit is good. Roll 'em. You alright? You are betting against the dice. Against. Willie. I got enough. Roll 'em. Ace deuce. Seven. The winner. You lose. Which just shows you. Never bet against yourself. Hot or cold. Get away from that table! Move! Over there! You! I said move! Come on, keep it going. Back over there. Get back. If nobody moves nobody gets hurt. Get away from that door. You'll never pull it off. Kill him. You figured I wouldn't holler "cop" because of them. You are not touching their money so that leaves them out. You didn't come here to stick up the joint. That's Ben Snelerr's gun. You didn't move before because you figured if Kurstyn won .. You'd roll him on the way home. You are cheap chisellers. Not gunmen. There is a difference in personality. You are bluffing. That's right. That's right. Keep talking. If you want to die, okay. After I shoot once, the next time is easy. They know that. Nobody is sticking their neck out for you. Maybe you are right. Who cares about a gambler? Certainly not those who lost money to him. Friends? Up to now I never needed one. Maybe that's why I had so many. Even if you are a good shot it's going take at least two bullets. Four. It will take two slugs to stop me. Edith, please. Get back. Get back! Get back. - Shoot. You might kill some of us but what about the rest? That's no use. Once you shoot you're finished. Put it down and you can walk out of here. Your frame with Robbie worked. You should have stopped then. No, no! I didn't. I didn't! When somebody loses in my place they always get car-fare home. Throw 'em out. Charley. How did you know they were bluffing? I didn't but I had to call it. Goodnight, George. About what happened. Those two chisellers, I mean. You know about it, don't you? I didn't want to do it. - Then why did you? I don't know. Scared, I guess. Alice? Is Lon there? Alright. Thank you. Suppose they are waiting for me? Outside. Right now. - Maybe they are. What will I do? What you always do. Start running. Charley. Goodnight, lover. - Goodnight. Keep an eye on this, will you. Charley. We might as well be partners all the way. That's a lot of anniversaries. Well, don't you need it? Never again. Except. 0nce more. How much money can you raise among you? Can you scrounge up five thousand? Yeah, I guess so. Sure. Why? - More if you need it. Your five grand against the whole joint. High card wins. Are you crazy? Pick a card. You mean the place will belong to us? If you win. The trappings alone are worth fifty thousand. Not good enough? Pick a card. No, sir. Not me. Pete. Go ahead. No. I can't. You do it. Let Charley's kid pick a card for us. Against his old man. That beats me. You are in business. See you. Goodnight. - Night. Night. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Are we fishing tomorrow? - Yep. Paul. Jack of Clubs? - Uhuh. You cheated. Well, there's always a first time. -(-s-d--)-
