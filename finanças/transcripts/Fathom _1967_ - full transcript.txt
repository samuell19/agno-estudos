Now jumping in the individual accuracy competition, Miss Fathom Harvill of the United States team. Señorita, a smile would make it perfect. - They never make a fuss of me when I land. - Let your hair grow longer. Señorita, how did you ever get a name like Fathom? A fathom is six feet. Papa was hoping for a tall son. Papa was disappointed. Think the US team will beat the French next week? - That's the idea, isn't it? - Miss Harvill? Miss Harvill, I'm supposed to drive you back to town. - Thank you. - How come we have to take the bus? I keep telling you, George, let your hair grow longer. I'll be with you as soon as I change. The one thing I'll never understand: How do you get the nerve to take the firstjump? It's easy. You learn parachute-packing, study up on meteorology, wind currents, aerodynamics, and then when the big day comes, you get someone to give you a big push. Say, didn't we pass the road to Málaga? We're taking a slight detour. Nothing to worry about. Colonel Campbell wants to see you. - Colonel Campbell? - He'll explain everything. - But I don't know any Colonel Campbell. - You will. Good day to you, Miss Harvill. A very good day. I've been looking forward to our meeting. Come inside, won't you? In you go, love. Do sit down. Oh, excuse me. I'm not a very good housekeeper. Now, I'm going to be very calm about this whole thing. If you take me back to my hotel room, I'll forget all about it. If you don't, I'll holler murder to the embassy. A very normal reaction, Miss Harvill. I'll tell you what. If my credentials don't entirely satisfy you, I'll holler with you. Hades? Headquarters Allied Defences Espionage and Security. Impressive signatures - or you're a mad autograph collector. Very good. But not mad. Colonel Douglas Campbell, late of the Scots Guards, presently in charge of this very powerful and very secret organisation. Do sit down. Get that, Tim. Let me introduce you. Lieutenant Timothy Webb, Royal Air Force, on leave of absence. Leave of senses is more like it, volunteering for this outfit. I apologise, Miss Harvill, for having brought you here in this unorthodox way, but you'll see it's a matter of the utmost urgency. - I don't believe a word of this. - I assure you, it's desperately real. Please. It's Washington, sir. NSA frequency code 12. I'll put it through the scrambler. Oh, I'm squeaking again. The sea air disagrees with the lubricant in my titanium knee joint. Hades One to NSA liaison. Over. No negative information, eh? Thank you kindly. Hades One out. No worries there. That message was about you, Miss Harvill. You've been cleared by Washington at the highest level. - Cleared? For what? - Whitehall code check A-OK, sir. Good. Excuse me. Take a message, will you? To US navy force FD via liaison Gibraltar. Tell them Hades won't be needing any assistance at the moment - assuming that Miss Fathom Harvill, dental assistant, La Jolla, California, on a three-week tour with the US jumping team, is half what I think she is. Well, half of her is fascinated. But the other half tells me to get out of here. The first half is the one I like - the brave and bonnie one who's going to help us find the fire dragon. - Fire dragon? - The name of this game, lassie. And Lord have mercy on this poor sad world if we should fail. Amen. Some time ago there was a calamity in the air. One of our hydrogen bombs was lost in the Mediterranean Sea. - A fantastic search was made. - I remember. It was found, finally. Aye, the bomb was found. That's history. The bomb they found, but not the fire dragon. Code name for the contents of this wee box - fire dragon. Well named. It's a fail-safe device which triggers the hydrogen bomb by electronic signal. Need I say what it would mean if this fire dragon fell into hostile hands? For a year, not a trace, though we scoured the earth and veritably sieved the sea. Then a week past Tuesday, newsreel pictures. A corrida, Málaga. Routine. We look over everything from the south of Spain. Watch now. One Peter Merriwether. Next to him, his great good friend Miss Jo-May Soon. They're from Hong Kong. Popped up the day before these were taken. Devoted aficionados. Really, Red Chinese agents. Pure and simple, lassie, with this box in their hands they'd have the power to turn the world into a mushroom. Merriwether's current headquarters, this villa above the sea near Málaga. They're passing as innocent tourists. Valid passports, papers quite in order. The place is walled and guarded, impregnable from land. They didn't exactly appreciate our flyover. You'll see what I mean. - Major Jo-May Soon. - Major? That was the rank she held in the Mongolian KGB. Tasty fortune cookie, that one. Enter the boss, Peter Merriwether. Closely attended by underlings, the Trivers family. Mr T is the boss's second-in-command. Not having bullet-proof trousers on, exit hastily, yours truly. Only one reason for them being in this area - the fire dragon. The infernal thing's known to be their number-one objective. - You think they have it? - They'd be halfway across the world by now. But they're on its trail. We're quite certain the fire dragon's been found by some person unknown and Merriwether intends to get it from him. Problem: Who's that person? - Milk? - Please. A problem we tried to solve by dropping a radio-transmitting bug from that helicopter. Unfortunately, the device malfunctioned. And that, lassie, is where you come in. - Don't tell me. I can see it perfectly. - Do you? I was sitting there thinking while you were showing me those movies. "Why me?" I said to myself. "Why Fathom Harvill?" Couldn't be cos she's fun at a party. Couldn't be cos someone needs their teeth cleaned. Has to be some special knack. Has to be her skydiving. Right? Obviously. Plus the fact that you're a girl - and a very pretty one too, if I may say so. Gets nicer and nicer. I skydive into a pad full of mad Mongolian butchers and seduce the boss into telling all. - My dear lassie, you don't have to do a thing. - Just land there, that's all. A bonnie girl skydiver swept helplessly off course by treacherous winds. The secret will be under your hat, you see. A skydiver's helmet with a slight modification - a small radio transmitter. A bee in your bonnet. A bee to sting life into the wee bug we dropped on the roof. It needs the stimulation of another radio signal very close and very powerful. - Your entry into the villa will do the trick. - Why not send for your own paratroopers? The nearest parachute battalion's in Aden, a day away. We can't risk the time. But I've spent all year cooped up in an office staring at molars. I've been looking forward to this trip. The team leaves for Perpignan tonight. And you'll be with them tomorrow with first-class transportation and our grateful thanks. How long does one jump take? Good luck, love. The radio. The bee in your bonnet. Start it operating. Act perfectly natural. - Tell them you've turned an ankle. - They won't hurt you, love. The last thing they want is to give themselves away. See the beauty of it? Good luck, Fathom Harvill. Very good luck. Hello? Anybody home? Is someone there? Hello. Listen, I think you moved a bit. Hold itjust the way you are, will you? - What are you talking about? - Hold it right there. Could be ajournalistic first. Killer caught in act. Run through it once more, holding your blunt instrument. Now, waitjust a minute. You can't think that I... Murder unknown stranger? Oh, yes, I can think most easily. I can't imagine what else one could think. You and your chum obviously broke in here while Miss Soon and I were out driving our friends to the beach. You had a wild party. Then, under the combined influence of my best champagne and your undoubted charms, the poor fellow must have lost his head, so you bopped him. - Just one small mistake. - Really? What's that? I don't murder people I haven't been introduced to. I found him dead in your living room - no doubt where you just left him. - The impudence of this creature! - And so lovely, too. I hate disbelieving lovely girls. Merriwether's my name. P for Peter. What's yours? Harvill. Fathom. F for fathead. I dropped in by mistake at the end of a parachute. A parachute? I was making a practice skydive and I drifted off course into your terrace. Well, what do you know? There is parachute on the terrace. What an extraordinary way for a girl to drop in. - Isn't it? - No. Happens to parachutists every day. I'm sure of that. If you're just an accidental dropper-inner, you can't have anything to hide, can you, poppet? Arms extended, please. No, no, not folded. Extended. Good girl. - Will suffice, Peter. - No, not quite, I'm afraid. We do have to be completely thorough, leave no fair stone unturned. - Enjoying the view? - It's highly gratifying. You've nothing concealed. Correction. A lightning right hand. - What did you expect to find? - Come on. Campbell didn't tell you? Campbell? Tall man. He has a false leg. I once knew a Camberry. Nice guy. Tall enough. Red hair. But it couldn't be him. He was a pole-vaulter. You're either the coolest cookie I've ever met or as you said, a skydiver. With the nuttiest sense of direction. For the time being, we'll give you the benefit of the doubt. - Very handsome of you, Mr Merriwether. - Believe me, it's a pleasure. For the time being. Anywhere special you'd like to be taken? - The nearest town will do. - Fine. Saddle up two horses, Jo. You ride, don't you? I'm better in cars. So am I. But on this trip you'll see that horses have a definite advantage. Get her some clothes so she doesn't look conspicuous. - But Peter, don't you think? - No questions. I know what I'm doing. Yes, Peter. - You're splashy with women, Mr Merriwether. - My friends call me Peter. What do your enemies call you? Enemies? Me? No, I live in a world of love. Fathom. I've never met a Fathom. Where did you ever get a kinky name like that? First initials for uncles - Freddie, Arthur, Tom, Harry, Oscar, Milton. They were all rich and Papa wasn't taking any chances. Unlike me. Chance is what life is made of, poppet. Who would have thought an hour ago you and I would be transporting an unlucky stranger to his last resting place? - Necessity has made us allies. - Speak for yourself, Merriwether. Do you wanna whistle for the police? Where I come from, that's what we do when we find dead bodies. But when they arrived we'd have to show them some rather embarrassing pictures. - You want that? - Well, maybe reluctant allies. What say we drop the "reluctant" and make it a full-time partnership? You and me, a partnership? - In what? - Getting what we're after. I have no idea what you're after. All right. Let's stop playing games, shall we? I know you're working for Douglas Campbell. Campbell? You're obsessed with that name. Campbell's a loser. Don't you understand that? A loser in what? I never heard of the man. You know, I like you. You jump well, you ride well, you lie well. I hope you lose well. There's a nice blind curve on the highway below. Lend a hand. - What's the matter? - Sort of goes against the grain somehow. So will ten years in a Spanish poky. Just? A truck hits a hiker around a curve. That happens every day. The town is full of lousy drivers. I'm sorry about this, chum, more than you'll ever know. You're next, poppet. Why the panic? You did say the nearest town, didn't you? Here's where you get off. - Thanks, Merriwether. It's been gruesome. - Do yourself a favour, poppet. Throw away that parachute and fly back to wherever you came from. Mike, I ordered champagne for everybody. Didn't you hear me? I heard you, angel. I didn't hear your money. Trustless beast. Kurt will be here any minute with more money than you've ever seen. I don't doubt it, but I'm waiting till he comes back. Hello. Hi. - I think you have a reservation for me. - I hope so. - The name's Fathom Harvill. - How'd you get a name like Fathom? - It's short for Elizabeth. - You've got a room. Some fellow brought your bags in an hour ago. He didn't say you were a parachutist. - You have something against parachutists? - No. Your stuff's in number five. Help yourself to a key. Hey! Is everyone here camera crazy? You should be used to having your picture taken. Mike takes photos of everyone who stays here. It's the custom of the house. - But for you, angel, I'll find a good spot. - If I were you, I'd lock my door at night. No, that's no use. The proprietor always has a passkey. Thanks. I'll remember that. By the way, didn't your group take off for Perpignan last night? That's right. I was just getting in some last-minute practising. Greetings, love. I took the short cut. Up the trellis and through the window. - Take the same way out again. I'm blown. - Blown? - Isn't that the expression you agents use? - Oh, yes. Look, they only let me out to lead them to Campbell. - How do you know? - Merriwether thinks I work for him. - They have me half-framed for murder. - Whose murder? Young fellow I found in the villa, his head bashed in. - They have a picture of me bending over him. - Fathom, did they search you? Put it this way - my nextjumpsuit won't have a zipper. - It fits. It fits perfectly. - What fits? What I heard ten minutes ago. Listen to this. Tape recording via bug from Merriwether's villa. - The bee in your bonnet worked perfectly. - I'm glad something did. First you'll hear Jo-May Soon and the Trivers family. - What was that? - The Trivers kids with severe sunburn. They must have come back from the beach just after you left. Listen. Hello? Yes? - Never mind. - Take shrieking children elsewhere, please. Come on, sweeties, come on. Auntie Jo-May has to talk on the blower. Come on. Up we go. Come on. - Up we go. There we are. - Repeat, please. - Doesn't sound like much. - Wait. - Something up, deary? - Yes. Stunning development. Cable is intercepted in London. Cable addressed to Dr Vlak. He is invited to come here at once. Object: To authenticate fire dragon. This is something we didn't count on. Who sent for him? Is surprise. And yet not surprise. Of course, you don't know about him. Dr Vlak is a nuclear scientist. Don't you see how it all adds up? - In words of one syllable, uh-uh. - You will. Listen to the rest. I'll take it back a bit. This is something we didn't count on. Who sent for him? Is surprise. And yet not surprise. - Sergei Serapkin. - Then it wasn't the girl. Serapkin lured us away when the man was due to arrive with the fire dragon. He killed the young man, not the girl with parachute. - They thought you'd killed him and taken it. - But it was this Serapkin fellow. And his credentials fit. One-time street pedlar, now a pedlar in the unobtainable. Millionaire middleman for anything in short supply. In the '40s, penicillin. In the '50s, gold. - In the '60s, atomic devices. - He has the button, and they know it. He's aboard his yachtjust down the coast. We'd better move fast. - I'm moving fast - to Perpignan. - We have one piece of equipment they lack. Oh, no. I wouldn't set foot on board that yacht if I had the US marines as escort. We have something much more effective. This should display it well. Oh, I forgot to add. Sergei Serapkin - also world's champion bird chaser. Jo-May to headquarters. Most urgent. Do you read me? Jo-May to headquarters. Answer, please. Do you read me? Jo-May to headquarters. Answer, please. - Headquarters here. I read you. - Parachute girl and man depart in boat. Is curious, no? So soon after we received word of intercepted cable. Relax, Jo-May. I'll handle it. Right. Here's where we part company. The boat is round the next point. - You think he'll take the bait? - You're too modest. He'll bite on you. Now, let's run over it again. I vamp my way aboard, start fire and drive rat from the ship, hoping he takes the fire dragon with him. You can bet on it, love. He's planning to sell it for millions. Here's your fire starter. The left one's the bang-bang, right? Correct. It's triggered automatically when you take it off. - Drop it in any ventilator. 30 seconds later... - Yes, yes, I know. 30 seconds later, pow. Hop aboard your pleasure barge. Mind your step. Fathom, love, you're a real killer. I wish you hadn't said that, Timothy. So is he. Strange. A pirate ship? - You address its captain. - It's beautiful. In the presence of real beauty, it must take second place. How charming. - May I come aboard? - But obviously. You are expected. - I must have overlooked my invitation. - Serapkin's secret. He expects the unexpected. Mehmed. Yes, master? We will not be disturbed for 20 minutes. Wait. Perhaps... half an hour. Shall we leave this chill and go to to my cabin? Lovely hothouse you have here, Mr Serapkin. If I were an orchid, I'd be blooming. - You find the heat too great? - Hardly regulation for tropic waters. I suffer from an unfortunate malady. My body temperature is ten degrees below normal. In the presence of beauty it drops even further. Thank you. But how does a guy breathe in here? Please. I am very sensitive to draughts. I wish I'd known. I'd have brought my own oxygen tanks. Serapkin provides oxygen. Warm oxygen, purified and inducted from the engine room at a rate of three cubic metres a second. No companion of Serapkin's ever caught pneumonia. We will commence. Why, Mr Serapkin, I'll bet you could run a mile in three minutes. There is nothing more precious than time. My family comes from Circassia. We have an ancient saying. "Each hour is a wound, the last one fatal." Where I come from, we have an ancient saying too: "Men on the make can go jump in the lake." This coyness bores me. My companions are not selected for their skill at chess. Companions? You were not sent here by the concierge of the Hotel Solymar? I see what you mean. I am sorry, but I'm not one of your playmates. It is Sergei Serapkin who must apologise. Please, sit down, Miss? Harvill. Fathom Harvill. Please don't ask me how I got the name Fathom. Let me guess. Your father wanted a very tall son. Or you were named after wealthy relatives. Or as a child, you were very deep. Two out of three. That's not bad. I am appalled at my crudeness and bad manners. Serapkin will make amends. Now, let me see. Ah, yes. Earrings. Just the thing. Black pearls for plastic. - A fair exchange? - I couldn't. But I insist. Serapkin is quite aware enchanting women do not find him Apollo. Really, I'm just a mariner who lost her way. Intriguing. A lost mariner for whom black pearls are not sufficient. Does she sail for richer treasure? What have you got to offer? You are a pirate. Then, so am I. Come. We will go ashore. Ashore? Now? Yes. I must meet a gentleman from London. The result of our meeting may recompense me for the more gentle plunder you have denied me here. Sergei... Dove chick. Dove chick. You're so cool. Fire! Fire! Fire, master! Fire! Fire! Don't you ever knock? Sorry, sir. There is fire in the engine. Quick. Go quickly, before the fuel tanks explode. Hurry, mistress. Hurry! You will fetch my flask of brandy. Don't worry. We will wait. OK. Somebody has to fight the fire. - Friends of the bride? - The bride's not that sporty. I'd say friends of the groom. The wedding will be interesting - particularly the exchange of gifts. Look out! No! No! No! On the left! On the left, imbecile! On the right. On the right. Behind you, fool! It's amazing the fish you can pull from the sea if you're patient. - This fish feels a bit shaky. - Any fish would with what you were carrying. - We'll cut it open back at the trailer. - All right. Merriwether. He never gives up, even when he's lost. Keep following, chum. Campbell's got a nice reception committee waiting for you. Look out! - Leaving so soon, dear? - Get out of my way. That's not polite. Nice girls always stay for breakfast. - Please, get away from the door. - But then, you're not a nice girl, are you? - Hold it, poppet. Hold it. - She's killed my missus. She's killed my missus! You're getting a bad reputation. Every time you come here, somebody dies. I gave you the benefit of the doubt yesterday. There's none today. Jo. I hate bad jokes. What did you do with the fire dragon? Did you give it to Campbell? - I don't know what you're talking about. - There's no one here to help you. Don't underrate us. We let you go to Serapkin. We wanted you to do our dirty work. Then you and your boyfriend pulled a switch. Last time. Where is it? I said, where is it? I said... It's all right. Jo, Trivers, take that door. Where's Campbell? Poppet, over here. - Now, the fire dragon. Where is it? - I don't know! Try to remember. Who's going to get tired first? You or the bull? You owe me something, ducks, for my missus. You'd better answer those questions. Take it easy on yourself, poppet. You're young. Life can be fun. It's a beautiful world. Then why do you want to blow it up? Isn't that a bit melodramatic? What are H-bombs? Light comedy? H-bombs? How the devil did H-bombs creep into this cosy chat? H-bombs, fail-safe devices, what's the difference? We're all after the same thing. I'll die before I help you get it. Trivers, give her a hand. - Thank you. - Any time. Drink your coffee and listen to a strange story. It begins quite a time ago, during the Korean War. See, there was an officer with the UN forces who was listed missing in action. He wasn't missing. He walked across the lines one night and gave himself up to the Chinese. He had a crazy scheme. His name was Douglas Campbell. Interested? Pass the sugar, please. His objective was to get to Peking, but he stepped on a mine and was nearly killed. - Next three years, hospital in Xinjiang. - Accounting neatly for his tin leg. Scepticism duly noted. He'd convinced them of his reliability by then and was sent to Hankow University. - He was still a long way from Peking. - But I have a feeling you'll get him there. It took him quite a while, but he got there. One rainy day he took a stroll to the virtually unguarded Imperial Museum. He walked inside carrying a large guidebook. Five minutes later he walked out again. In the hollowed-out interior of that guidebook was his glittering prize. Prize? The needle in our haystack, poppet. The fire dragon. The most important piece from the ancient treasure of the Ming dynasty. But if Campbell's ajewel thief, who are you? A creature of circumstance. Well, look at the spot the Chinese were in. They could hardly call up Interpol and say, "One of our national treasures is missing." Unthinkable loss of face. So they did the only thing they could do. They came to us. Peter Merriwether and Co, enquiry agents. 21 Marlborough Street, Hong Kong. In our lingo, a private eye. He fooled us too, poppet, more than once. He gave us the slip in Hong Kong and again in Manila. Next stop, San Francisco. There he devised a master stroke. Bribed some sap of an air-force type to smuggle it halfway across the world to Ankara, where it was to be broken up. It might have worked except for a fantastic mischance. The atom bomber that blew up. Right. Like Campbell, we thought the fire dragon was irretrievably lost - until a young scuba diver, Kurt Wolff, fished it right out of the Mediterranean. We were about to make a deal with Kurt when... Well, you know what happened. Mr Serapkin got there first. - What's the matter? - A black Fiat. Been following us since Málaga. - Serapkin? - Or Campbell. What do you think brought him to Spain? Robber follows cops. Hold tight. - Is this death grip necessary? - I'm protecting you. Like the way you incited that bull to make hamburger meat out of me? I assumed you were on Campbell's side. I never dreamed we'd be forming our partnership, partner. Hold the phone. What makes you think I buy your story? Because of my devastating sincerity. It shines like a candle in this naughty world. I'm sorry, but all you've shown me so far is a slightly-used calling card. I'm notjumping from one traffic jam to another. I'm afraid ajam is exactly what you're in. That cabbage head of Serapkin's, that's a pointless joke, unless he knew we expected to find the fire dragon. Either way, he knows where it is. Go ask him. OK? I'd rather go back into the bullring. I'm suggesting it as penance, poppet. Penance for the eighth deadly sin - gullibility. How much are you getting for this job, anyway? $100,000. Goodbye, Mr Merriwether. Here's another reason why you'll help me. If you don't, I'll turn you over to the cops. Mrs Trivers, remember? Crawl back under your rock. You're making a nice fat target. That mysterious black Fiat - it never was following us, was it? But I rather doubted you'd fall for the running out of gas bit. And I did want to get close to you. Poppet, I don't enjoy throwing you back to the lions. But you get a kick out of sending me to jail. On the other hand, it's the only way you'll discover I'm the good guy in this story. Suddenly I can't think of anything more important. You've got to be out of your mind. Don't touch it. Miss Harvill, I must have heat, but I dislike firecrackers. Please, take off your earrings and your bracelet. Put them down there. Helicopters... mysterious speedboats... ingenious explosives. Serapkin is exhilarated by competition, but only when he knows who his competitors are. Your employers? Their names? Who are they? I'll make you a deal. I'll give you the answers, you give me the fire dragon. I admire you, Miss Harvill. Oh, I admire you greatly. You're cool. From Serapkin there is no greater compliment. Your offer is generous, but quite impossible. I do not have the fire dragon. Then why did you send to London to have someone authenticate it? You're well informed. Amazingly. I did send to London, but all I had to show was a picture taken by the man who proposes to sell it to me. The fire dragon, Miss Harvill. The grail for which we all thirst. - A bit cross-eyed, isn't he? - A defect in the camera's eye, not the dragon's. - Then you really don't have it? - No. But I know who does. That's good enough. Tell me where he is. I'll get it from him. Very well. You go to Málaga. You go to the market. You go to the third stall on the left. The man is there. He's a cabbage salesman. Your coolness exceeds even my own, Miss Harvill. Why, apart from your amply evident charms, should I give you the one piece of the puzzle which only I possess? You're a distinguished man, Mr Serapkin. You wouldn't want to clutter up your house with a lot of stolen objects. My dear girl, half the objects in the Louvre are stolen. All right, then here's a better reason. You might wanna live a little longer, and the man you're dealing with is a murderer. What makes you think so? The fire dragon was found by a skin diver named Kurt. Kurt took his last dive yesterday. What a delightful bit of news. You see, Miss Harvill, I am a collector. I am not interested in the past history of a work of art, only its acquisition. Your information has merely dealt me a stronger hand. Unlike yours, which I fear has entirely run out of cards. Beauty is a fragile thing, Miss Harvill. It can be so easily destroyed. Now, who are you working for? That's a good question. I wish I knew that myself. Serapkin always gets what he wants. Who are these people? Who are my enemies? Pencil me in as number one. Let her go. I have a funny house rule. I like my customers in shape to pay their bill. Do you know to whom you speak, señor? I don't care if you're king of the Eskimos. Out. You will hear from Serapkin, señor. Oh, yes. You will hear very, very soon. Good day, dove chick. The travel agents did say that Spain wouldn't be boring. Thank you. Oh, bed, breakfast and bouncing, all for £3 a day. If you like, we can talk about it over coffee. I wouldn't say I was in trouble - aside from a little treason, arson, murder, and a parking ticket four days ago in Seville, I'm having a picnic. I've a funny feeling you're kidding on the square. Señor Mike, the langosta for the lunch. - Miss Harvill and I are going to get them now. - Where are we going? We've got lobster on the menu and I have to pull them in. - The boat's a good place to talk. - Sounds lovely. I'll get my gear. I won't be a second. If you want to put some cognac in your coffee, I wouldn't blame you. Someone you know? - We were never introduced. - That's funny. Kurt was run over before you came into town. How did you meet him? Well... Ulla was telling me about him. He was a good boy. Wish I had a better picture of him. It's that damn camera of mine. - Your camera? - Yes. It has a scratch on the lens. I'll have to get myself a new one sometime. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Why are you so interested in my pictures? Well, I like looking at pictures. That's what they're here for, isn't it? You know, you're right. Come on. Careful, angel. Those things are dangerous. - What luck in Lobsterville? - Let's see, shall we? Well, what do you know? - Funny-Iooking lobster. - Yeah. Looks more like a fire dragon. Don't you want to touch it? After all the trouble it's given you? That was a mistake. I've been making quite a few of those lately. This one's fatal. When you showed so much interest in my pictures, I had a feeling you knew about me. And now I'm sure. You know I murdered Kurt. He found this thing when he was diving and he showed it to me. I took a picture of it and showed it to my friend Serapkin. He made me a big offer. So when Kurt told me he was doing a deal with your friends up there at the villa, I got 'em out of the house and... It would've been much easier if you hadn't turned up. Itjust ain't fair. Murderers get such lousy breaks. See you in jail! Welcome home, lassie. - Stay away from me. - You're among friends. Stop it. I'm 100 years older than the day we met. - I'm afraid Merriwether's been talking to her. - And very convincing, no doubt. The tale of a rogue who deserted in Korea long years ago. Was that not it? The tale was true, lassie, every word of it - with one wee exception. That rogue who deserted was not myself, but one Peter Merriwether. We're the cops. They're the robbers. My card. Campbell and Associates, enquiry agents. No. 7, Prince of Wales Street, Hong Kong. Some little man in a cellar must be making a lot of money printing up these. If true, why the story about the H-bomb? Oh, that. A hoax, old girl. Rather brilliantly engineered. You see, there's a bloody great fee for bagging the fire dragon and that Merriwether chap. Haven't you lost something, Campbell? Whither the rolling Highland burr? Corroborative detail, old girl, to lend verisimilitude to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative. I thought it might make me sound more official. - And we needed a skydiver. - Needed one desperately. Had I told you the truth, would you ever have made thatjump? Unlikely. You'd scarcely have risked your neck for a mere bauble stolen from the Red Chinese. You haven't popped into the dear thing in your recent adventures? I wondered when you'd get around to that. It could even explain how you so conveniently popped into me just now. Come again, old girl? There's a funny kind of guardian angel watching over me. He just saved my life. Of course, he's not all angel. - He ran off with the fire dragon. - What? - You saw it? - Yes. But not my unknown angel. I was in the boat with Mike when he fished it out of the sea. - He won't be fishing any more. - Merriwether. - Or Serapkin. - Or you, Colonel Campbell, or Mr Campbell, or whatever you're calling yourself this season. You've been through a hellish lot, but I hope for your own sake you can still recognise the truth. All I believe is what I see with my own eyes. Like Mrs Trivers... who I shot this morning. Spain, land of passion and romance... and resurrection. Behold the dead Mrs Trivers. The rascals rigged it. Planted a gun loaded with blanks. - They wanted a strong hold on you. - Well, it's broken now. If I were you, old girl, I'd get out of Spain with a minimum of delay. I can't believe it. Is someone inviting me out of this party? With my blessings, Fathom Harvill, and my profound apologies for having placed you in such danger. This will see you back to your merry troupe of skydivers. - Come on, love. I'll drive you back to town. - Don't bother, love. I can find my own way. You're leaving so soon, Fathom? Mike will be surprised. - Don't count on that. - Will you ever come back here? Maybe - if I'm in a plane over Málaga and the pilot says, "I have to make a forced landing." Even then I'll think twice about it. That's funny. It never did that before. And I'm late. Will you do me a favour and pay the bill? Sure. - Can I help you? I'll take the little one. - There's someone else waiting to do that. - I see no one waiting. - You wouldn't, but believe me, he's waiting. - Where? - That's a good question. Don't worry about it. I'll know him when I see him - if he doesn't see me first, that is. Get what I mean? - Absolutely not. - Lucky girl. Poppet! Hey, hey, where are you going? I've been looking for you everywhere. - Sorry. I was hoping you wouldn't be. - What does that mean? Why don't you ask Mrs Trivers? Maybe she can explain. Excuse me, please. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, poppet! I've been expecting you, dove chick. - Join me. - Think fast, Serapkin. - You're safe now. - Timothy. Campbell was sure you'd be followed. - Which one do you suppose it is? - How did Campbell know? Only one reason you got out of that boat. Someone wanted you to run. - Why? - One possibility. I think someone's cast you as a pigeon. Carrier type. Allow me. - Where are you going? - Why are you running away from me? - I can explain about Mrs Trivers. - I could do with comic relief. Well, at last. The face that launched a thousand "wanted" posters. The notorious Korean deserter has a sense of humour. - Where are the rest of your things? - What are you doing on this train? - You don't believe this criminal stooge? - Dove chick. Why, Mr Serapkin. Oh. I was so rude to you a moment ago. Won't you join us? Delighted. - Love, are you crazy? - I love to be surrounded by men. Lots of men. It makes me feel so secure. I feel quite a different sensation. Normally Serapkin is chilled, but this gathering warms his blood. I feel on fire - dragon fire. Excuse me, sir. I would like to thank you, dove chick, for arranging this meeting of my congenial competitors. Yes. Isn't it a coincidence? One cosy little family, all with a sudden irresistible urge to travel. No coincidence. I saw that menace on your trail and I hopped aboard to protect you. Isn't it sad? Everybody wants the other fellow's job. How sweet. Three gallant protectors. Do not include me, dove chick. I do not wish you any harm, but my presence here is motivated by man's purest emotion - greed. Thank heaven for an honest man. Gentlemen, I am going to win. Now, how do you propose we play the game? I'm a detective, Serapkin. I'm playing hide and seek. Somebody hid it and I seek it. A child's game. I trust, Mr Merriwether, you can offer something a little more formidable? I play all games. Golf, tennis, poker... I even toss the caber. The only game I ever lost was spin the bottle, and that was on purpose. How sad. I am a Ione professional in a field of amateurs. Well, then, let me tell you what kind of a game I'm playing. - Gesundheit. - Thank you. Could one of you hand me my bag, please? Thank you. The name of the game, gentlemen, is "Little Bo Peep comes out of her sleep". Excuse me. When this train gets to Madrid, I'm taking a cab ride straight to the American Embassy. I'll tell them a story about three fascinating gentlemen I met in the south of Spain. About a Mr Merriwether, a might-be detective or a may-be Korean defector. And about a phoney colonel and lieutenant who could be public enemies number one and two. And then there's that furry hothouse flower. No doubt about him. A man with a treacherous timepiece who always has time for something treacherous. I'm going to spill every last bean in the can. Anyone wanna take that cab ride with me? Well? Well, what's wrong? Is my slip showing? - What's going on? - I just found out who the bad guys are. - I don't get it. - I do. The fire dragon. It was in her case. Game's over. I'm suddenly frozen again. I don't feel so hot myself. From my Circassian ancestors I've inherited an admirable trait - the gift of losing gracefully. Well, I shall feel better after a cup of warm brandy. - A pleasure to have met you, sir. - Thank you, sir. Don't mention it, sir. You drive a speedboat very carelessly, sir. It's just not my day. - What are you doing? - Telling Campbell to look for Merriwether. You've got it twisted, love. Tell him Merriwether is looking for us. Fathom, love, you're brilliant. Brilliant indeed. It dazzles me. I'll take it. Come on, now. You don't expect me to be afraid of a silly little watch again? Don't ever underestimate me, dove chick. This way out, love. Why'd you do that? There's a fine, you know. Conductor, I've got him. - I saw him myself. - Yes, and he's got a watch with a knife in it. - Wait. I forgot my suitcase. - Forget it, love. - I'll buy you a whole new wardrobe in Paris. - Paris? Campbell's waiting at an airstrip. Let's leave Spain before Merriwether picks up the scent. Gracias, old man. Come on, love. - You called the tune, sir. She had it. - Let me see it. I hope I never do again. Fantastic. One of the great glories of Chinese culture. - No wonder they want it back. - I'll fire up the plane, sir. Good. Come along, old girl. I've got some flying togs for you. Thank you. I know it sounds inadequate, but I am most grateful. Thank you. - How nice, sitting in a parachute again. - Always insist on them. You too, sir. Not likely. I'm not taking any chances at this stage. If the engine conks out we can draw straws who takes the fire dragon. Close the door. Right. Verily it is said, "Great shall be the rejoicing for that which was lost and has been found." - Better check the weather, Timmy. - Right, sir. Calling Barcelona weather. Cessna Golf Alpha Tango Sierra Lima. Over. We read you, Golf Alpha Tango Sierra Lima. What's the weather northeast of Barcelona? A trough of depression 100 miles northeast. Suggest alter heading to 068. Over. Thank you. Out. - We couldn't have it better. - That's good news. - Then it's three for Ankara. - Did I hear you say Ankara? - That's right. - What happened to Paris? A rather risky place to dispose of stolen gems, Paris. You see, your friend Mr Merriwether spoke the truth. He is the detective. I'm the thief. I don't suppose you'd land this crate and let me off? I'd like to very much indeed. Unfortunately, you're just the sort of girl who'd go running straight to the police. - How about trying to corrupt me a little? - What do you think, guv'nor? A delightful idea, but I'm afraid it's just not on, old lad. What a shame. It could've been fun trying. Well, in that case... Geronimo! Go ahead. You've rigged it. It won't open! How did you guess, love? I guess you're right. There will be three for Ankara. Exactly. Three. Timothy, yours truly and the fire dragon. You were heading in the right direction before. "Girl Skydiver Victim of Tragic Carelessness." Get out of that door. - Get out. - No! Reckless maniac! Hello, Campbell. Do you want to land now or do I follow you to Ankara? He's been tuning in on our transmissions! What the devil is he doing? Watch closely, Merriwether. Here comes a flying lesson. Keep your head down, poppet. Let him come round. Now throttle back. Hold her steady. - Not quite close enough. - I'll push that cocky devil right into the cliff. Where did he go? Don't look now, Timmy boy, but that propeller on your tail, that's me. Silly creature. You're laughing at me. It's not funny. Sorry about that, guv'nor. Come on, poppet, don't panic. Get into that seat. I can get you out of this. One hand on wheel, the other on throttle. Feet on rudder pedals. Wheel, hard left. Push it forward. Back on throttle. Come on, poppet. Back on throttle. Wheel forward. Don't be afraid of diving. You've gotta dive before... Poppet, watch out. Watch out! Pull up! Pull up, poppet! Poppet! You can fly! Well, here we are, just you, me and the fire dragon. Yeah, I guess that's right. - To get it, you stopped Mike from killing me. - Right. You hid the devil in my handbag so you wouldn't have to share it with Jo-May. I did? Then you were going to catch up, split it with me. Right? Oh, right, right. Absolutely right. Well, where shall it be? Tahiti? Zanzibar? The golden trail to Samarkand? An igloo in Baffin Land would be heaven with you to warm it, poppet. - We've got the whole rainbow. - Right. The sun in the morning and the moon at night. Right. - We'll stand this whole planet on its head. - Right. It's ours. AII... Poppet, what are you doing? What are you doing? I wish... I wish... Oh, no. No. I... Don't do that, poppet. Poppet, please, I beg you. I'll do anything. Please. Please, don't. Don't! Bye-bye, dragon baby. Have a nice trip home to China. How could you? How could you do such a thing? I'm sorry. I guess I'm not cut out for a life of crime. Excuse me for sounding nervous, but what happens to me now? You have no problem. You've returned the fire dragon. Your friends don't even have to know the truth. You may even wind up a hero. I may at that. Oh, that's very nice of you, poppet. Just call it a farewell gift to a friend who saved my life. Toodle-oo, Merriwether. Where do you think you're going? Back to my merry group of skydivers. Oh, that's funny. I had a feeling we'd meet at Pedro's Bar at 7:30. I'm heading for Perpignan. Pedro's is in Torremolinos, not Perpignan. Remember, now. 7:30. You may have a long wait. I don't think so. I have a hunch you're going to be very prompt. You seem very sure of yourself. Tell me something, poppet. Does Z443771 mean anything to you? Z44... - Why, that's my passport number. - Your picture doesn't do you any justice. You see, poppet, I don't intend to be a loser twice in one day. - Where did you say we'd meet? - Pedro's. 7:30. And don't be late. Visiontext Subtitles: Margaret Burke ENGLISH
