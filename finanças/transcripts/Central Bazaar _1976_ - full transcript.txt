Once upon a time... there were three little pigs who all lived together in a forest. Now, those three little pigs had nowhere to live and they really wanted somewhere to live because they didn't like sleeping under trees and in bushes and it got very cold when it rained. One day, their old aunt left them some money so that they could build themselves a house. She left them enough money that they could build themselves a house each. "I know what I'm going to do," said the first little pig. "I'm going to build myself a house of straw. That way I can get it done in a day and go off and spend the rest of the money and have a good time." So he went off to the farmer and he bought some straw and he quickly made himself a straw house shaped like that. Once he'd done that, he went off and played. "Ha!" said the third little pig, "that's no good! What'll you do if the Big Bad Wolf comes along?" "I don't care," said the first little pig, "I'm gonna go off and have a good time." And he went off down the road, dancing and singing, "Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf! The Big Bad Wolf! The Big Bad Wolf! Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf! Not me, me, me, me, me." Second little pig said, "I'm going to build my house of wood, that way it'll be safe but it'll also be cheap then I can spend lots of money on good food." So, he went to the woodsman and he bought lots of wood and he built himself a little shack that was one floor and shaped like that. That only took him a couple of days to build and then he went off to market and he bought himself lots of good things to eat. "Ha!" said the third little pig, "You are a lazy bunch, aren't you? I'm going to build a proper house with bricks and mortar and a roof and a chimney and windows with shutters and a big strong door. So that if the Big Bad Wolf comes, he won't be able to get into my house." And he set to work. First of all he went to the brick makers and he bought lots of bricks and lots of mortar and then he spent the next month building his big brick house. It was a beautiful house. The bricks were red and blue and the roof was green and he had a lovely chimney and he painted the shutters red and the door green to match the roof and he put flower pots outside the windows and it was a beautiful house although it took him a long time to finish it. First little pig and the second little pig thought he was very stupid, very stupid indeed because he took so long and he was so careful. "Ha!" said the first little pig, "I don't know what you're bothering with, doing all that and taking all that time. Here you are still sleeping out in the rain having a... "Ha!" said the second little pig, "I think you're very very silly!" "Why?" said the third little pig. "I think you're silly because I'm perfectly safe and all right in my wooden hut and nobody will be able to get into it and I've brought all that money left over from great heart and I've been able to go to the market three times this week and buy lots of lovely food." But the third little pig wasn't bothered one way or the other and just went on very quietly building his house and having a lovely time doing it. It hadn't been long when he'd finished it when the Big Bad Wolf arrived. He sniffed, "I smell a little pig!" And he strolled along very quietly indeed until he saw the three little pigs sitting together talking to each other. "Aha!" said the Big Bad Wolf, "If I creep up very quietly indeed I'll be able to catch them." So he crept up very quietly indeed but just before he got up to the three little pigs, third little pig said "Shhh! I hear something!" And they all stopped and they all listened. And then first little pig said, "It's the Big Bad Wolf! Run everybody! Run!" So they all ran to their homes as quickly as possible. First little pig ran to his straw house and shut the door. Second little pig ran to his wood house and closed the door. The third little pig ran to his brick house, slammed the door, pushed the bolt shut and felt safe. The wolf very slowly walked up to the first little pig's house and he knocked on the door. "Let me in, little pig!" he said. "No, no! Go away! I don't want anything to do with you!" said the first little pig. "Let me in little pig or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down." The first little pig said, "No, you're can't! I've got my own home now, I'm perfectly safe!" "Aha!" said the Big Bad Wolf, "I'll blow your house down in no time at all!" And he took a big breath and he went... The straw house shook and it trembled and it blew away, far far away, leaving the first little pig shaking in his shoes and he looked at the wolf and he went "Oh! Oh! Oh!" And he ran as fast as he could to the second little pig's wooden house and he knocked on the door and said "Let me in! Let me in, as quickly as you can!" And the second little pig opened the door, let him in and slammed it shut. "Ha!" said the first little pig. "I'll be all right here." Then the wolf walked up to the second little pig's door. "Let me in, or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!" "Oh no, you won't" said the second little pig. "No you won't. This is a wood house, I'm perfectly safe." "Oh, yes?" said the Big Bad Wolf and he took a deep breath and he... Blew as hard as he could but because it was a wooden house the house just shook very very hard but it didn't go down. "Aha!" said the second little pig, "I told you!" "Ha!" said the wolf, "Just you wait and see!" And he took another big breath... and this time the wood house fell in pieces. Clunk! Leaving the first and the second little pig hanging onto each other absolutely terrified. "Quick! Quick!" said the second little pig, "Let's run as quickly to the third little pig's house and maybe we'll be all right there." So they ran and they ran as quickly and they knocked on the door and said "Let us in! Let us in! We're being chased by the Big Bad Wolf." "Hmm!" said the third little pig, "All right!" And he opened the door "but didn't I tell you so! I told you those houses weren't safe!" And then he slammed the door shut and shut the bolt... Isn't that more... I mean... wouldn't you think that would be more exciting than staying in the same place all the time doing the same thing. I mean, that - to me that would be a safe situation... always in the same... Oh sure I couldn't get into that. I mean that's really like terrible. Yeah, yeah. Um I think because - I mean in a way I... see it's... I mean it's not that I objecti - In a way I do objectify. I mean I'm more happy when I am with people than I am with myself. Well, I find concentration pretty hard. Like if you're a kid and you're given homework you um that develops - I mean that may not be a very good thing but it nevertheless... Because I think people really turn me on. I mean I really like people. People are so highly conditioned... to uh behave - you know, to... be told what to do. At least in public you're told where to walk and you know. It was a bit like that, yeah. It was like showing off, you know. It was - I liked that aspect to it... and uh... and butterflies in the stomach, you know. I mean I would have applied to be a samurai maybe, a bit like that you know. That, sort of, shadowboxing where in a way you sort of access one another and you sort of in a way you kind of get it out of the way. I mean, the problem with that really is that it - it's gotta be a person who's quite in tune with me. I mean I really got sort of hung up about my parents you know. But that's the sort of the street thing, isn't it? - Uh-huh. - You know? Like going to the fun fair you sort of go - I mean I could never make my mind up what to go on if I only had a small amount of money to spend and you just end up... looking uptight - I can't go on that because maybe that's better you know. So you're shooting all around. Daydream and fantasise you know. Which you're gay, I mean, that could bring us back to what's happening here. I just told some things... I don't know what I did enjoy but... I think it's the kind of thing that... it's nice to have behind you, you know. I think I've done a lot of things like that, that I've never really enjoyed but I sort of thought well get this one behind me. I don't know, I just can't work in a vacuum. I'll do another one. Umm... I'll do - uh... Greensleeves... Alas, my - that's wrong again... Alas, my love, you do me wrong To cast me off discourteously No, that's wrong. Alas, my love, you do me wrong To cast me off discourteously When I have loved you so long Delighting in your company Greensleeves was all my - I can't do it. Greensleeves was all my joys And greensleeves my heart of gold Greensleeves was my delight And who but my lady greensleeves Another one now... How should I my true love know From another one? No, wait. I started it wrong. Fuck! Well, that was right. How should I my true love know From another one? By his cockle hat and staff and his sandal shoon I can't do it, it's wrong! Wait! He is dead - I gotta start again. Alright - um - He is dead and gone, lady He is dead and gone At his head a grass-green turf At his heels a stone How should I my true love know From another one? By his cockle hat and staff And his sandal shoon He is dead and gone, lady He is dead and gone At his heels a grass-green turf At his head a stone White his shroud like the mountain snow Larded with green flowers Which bewept to the grave did go With true love showers I can't do that one anymore. Um, I'll sing... Should I sing one of my brother's songs? He'll kill me for this. And if you want me You'll know where I'll be Right here in the kitchen where you left me I haven't stirred since I heard your last word "Goodbye" And I want you ever before me... I can't sing that... It's too hard.
