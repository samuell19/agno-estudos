Hey, I was thinking about taking the horses for a run on the ridge. Perfect. And would you mind getting Toby, too? I think he really needs it. Yeah, sounds good. Cupid! Cupid! ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la... ♪ - Katie! - Hey, Donna. Do you have the stuff for me? Yep, I got it right here with me in the truck. Do you have to meet with a contractor? Yes, meeting with a contractor about the train depot. Oh, I love you, Katie. Thank you. All right. I'll see you soon. Well, well, well. If it isn't the lovely Miss Valentine here to spread some holiday cheer. Hi, Veronica. Can I have a hot cocoa please? So, what brings you in today? Well, I've got some salvage from the bank restoration for Donna, and then I'm meeting with a contractor about moving the old depot. -Wow, moving? -Yeah. The railroads need to widen the tracks eventually, and the station's just too close. Well, it sure would be a shame to lose it. Sure would. It's been in use for-- -For 80 years. -And it was built in-- - 1885. - I've mentioned it. A few times. How much does it cost to move a building that big? Ugh, it's gonna be a lot. The bad news is, I'm talking crazy money. The good news is, we've got time, and with grants and fundraisings, we should just about make it. Well, you could always ask Santa for help. Veronica. Be serious. What? You don't believe in Santa? Well... it's worth a shot. Sure is. I just sent him a letter earlier this week asking for a man, so... - Wait! - We'll see... But what about the actor? Well, don't you technically need to be paid to be an actor? Listen, the only acting this guy did was convincing me that he'd split the rent. Yeah, but you're still doing better than me. I can't imagine sitting through another Christmas dinner with my mom asking why I don't have a boyfriend. Aw. Oh, well. Oh, look at the time. Hey, I gotta run. -What do I owe you? -Don't worry about it. Put it towards the train station. You're the best. -Hi, Donna. -Katie! Do you have some good stuff for me? Yeah, I do. They're made from repurposed wood from the old bank, just north of town. Oh, yes, I drive by that all the time. Yeah, they're in the middle of a renovation right now, and can you believe they were just gonna toss out all this old great stuff? I can't. You're incredible. You bring me the greatest and coolest. Wait till you see what we did with the old... cast iron cures you brought last week. -I can't wait to see 'em. -I can't wait to show you. Do you have to meet with a contractor today? Oh, yes. The contractor down at the train depot. - Mm-hm? - Besides, I better get outta here before I buy up the whole store. Well, I love to hear that. I just can't wait for you to come back. -Thanks, Donna. -Oh, good luck to you today. Thanks. Bye! So, as you can see, despite being vacant a number of years, the structure is still in really good shape. You said 1885? Yes, 1885. The property's owned by the railroad, but the depot is owned and maintained by the village. Wow, for being as old as this is, it's in really good shape. But, I'm sorry, but I-- I can't move it. I can't do the job. Wha-- what do you mean? It's just, uh, it's just too big for me. I don't have the manpower or the equipment, you know, to handle somethin' like this. But I can give you the number of a firm in town. Shouldn't be a problem for them. They've moved a number of historic buildings. All right, excellent. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Hey, Mom, what's up? Hey, can you do your mom a solid? Olivia's down at the station giving Billy and the chief trouble again. You mean she's not out educating people on their first amendment rights again? I just don't have time. Go sort out what's going on with my favorite granddaughter. Sure. She is your only granddaughter. Yes, I know she's my only granddaughter, -but you could change that. -Mom, don't start. ♪ December twenty-fourth he works his favorite shift ♪ ♪ He goes from house to house all across the land ♪ ♪ Dropping off the presents with his reindeer band ♪ ♪ I asked him how do you do it said tell me the truth ♪ ♪ He said Santa keeps a bottle of bourbon in his boot ♪ ♪ Well I thought to myself now it all makes sense ♪ ♪ He's drinking top shelf with all the cookies and milk ♪ ♪ He had to find a way to fight off the cold ♪ ♪ It's a crazy Christmas story no one's ever been told ♪ ♪ Yeah his favorite part about the big red suit ♪ ♪ Is that Santa keeps a bottle of bourbon in his boot ♪ Hi. I'm Chief Murphy. And who might you be? I'm Nicholas Claus. Nick. Nick, you've been brought in today because you were trespassing on somebody's property... dressed like Santa Claus. Can you... Well, I was out lookin' for my lost reindeer. Oh. What's its name? -Cupid. His name is Cupid. -Cupid? Like the baby? With the tiny bow. No, no, no. Cupid is part of my team that makes my sleigh fly. You know, like, to bring toys to the boys and girls around the world? You know, milk and cookies? Is this a joke? Is this guy joking right now? Because I have no idea what's going on. But I do know I have better things that I could be doing. I'm pretty sure we all have better-- Wait, what? You arrested Santa? You're going to ruin Christmas. I'm telling everybody. Sit tight, Santa. Olivia, oh-- hold up now. Hold up. -We didn't arrest anyone. -This is so wrong. You need to let him go. Right away. Give it a second, okay? Can someone please explain to me what's going on here? Police Chief Murphy arrested Santa Claus and is going to ruin Christmas for people all over the world. Olivia. Thank you. We got a phone call this morning from Ron Montgomery. Someone was trespassing on his property, so I sent Billy out to investigate, and he comes back with this gentleman for questioning. He thinks he's Santa Claus. He is Santa Claus! Ho-ho-ho! It's all right, young lady. I'm just fine. I promise. I was just looking for one of my reindeer. Cupid, he ran off this morning. We need to help find him, Aunt Katie, or Santa won't be able to deliver presents all over the world. Okay, okay. Hey, Santa! When was the last time you saw him? Just this morning. He ran off into town. And has he run off before? Oh, yes. Cupid does this from time to time. - Okay. - Do you know why I call him Cupid? No. Why, Santa? Well, he's drawn to love. To bringing people together. Every time he runs off like this, he always seems to turn up right where love is blossoming. Okay, okay. I'm sure Chief Murphy will keep an eye out for Cupid. Isn't that right? - We will. - Mm-hm. Okay, Chief, I'm sorry, but with all due respect, you really want us spending our time running around town trying to catch a mythical, magical creature for Santa Claus? Don't you spend every weekend out looking for the Abominable Snowman? No, Katie, because that would be ridiculous. I spend every weekend trying to find Sasquatch. And for your information, I almost got a picture of him last weekend, but it was too dark. Well then, clearly, we have the right man for the job. I don't got time for this. I have some actual police work to do. I assure you, we are going to do everything within our power to find Cupid. Okay? Thank you. Okay... Nick. Santa. The homeowner isn't gonna be pressin' any charges, so you're gonna be free to go. However... I think it would be a great idea if you had a conversation with a mental health professional. Hey, it's me, Holly, and there goes Alan Turner and the Steel Horse Band, featuring Jackie Daniels. And we just got a phone call from Linda over at Battle Alley Coffee. Now get this, she's saying that there is a reindeer on the loose. She has seen it with her own eyes. Definitely not Rudolph, there's no red nose. But there is a little black nose, so be on the lookout for maybe Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen? Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen? We're not sure, but when you see it, give the radio station a call. Right now, it's KayLyn Pace. Thank you, councilmen and women. This depot is more than just a pile of bricks. It's our history. Its walls chronicle the story of Holly itself. It's windows and floors saw the narratives of our forefathers, as the accounts of how we started as a community began. Its very track served as a conduit to almost every family tree on this council board. We don't want to merely archive it away, like a painting in a museum's back room. We want to save it. And most importantly, we want to use it. First, by relocating it from its original place, then restoring it to its former glory. And finally, encouraging the residents of Holly to engage in it. Just imagine using that space for things like weddings and banquets. Classrooms and town hall meetings. The village treasury just can't handle this kind of monetary expense at this time. Our community is moving towards a new and exciting future, and we need to embrace that change. Listen, Katie, most of city council agrees with you. But our hands are simply tied. We just don't have the money. Well, there has to be something that we can do. I'm afraid it can't be done. The original five-year plan was ambitious in and of itself. We can't just let them tear it down. I, personally stand with Katie. Katie represents the future of Holly, Michigan. We have to find a way to support and fund the restoration of the depot. I believe we should make it a workable time frame -to make it happen. -Exactly. We cannot build a future without preserving and respecting our past. If they are not inspired by the past of our city, where will they find the strength to fight for our future. Julius. We appreciate your passion. But this meeting is adjourned. Terrible. You know how old this bible is? So, this bible is probably from the 1870s. Oh, hey, Katie. Come on in. The council president's waiting for you over there. Thanks, Nicole. Hi, Julius. Thank you so much for coming. -I think you know the senator. -Oh, again. Good to see you, Katie. Have a seat. So, Julius, uh, did you see the quote that I sent over? I did. And I've got some bad news. Senator, do you want to share with her what we learned? Yeah. Unfortunately, we were told we had five years. And now they say we have less than one year. What happened? I don't know. Something about expanding the tracks ahead of schedule. But I spoke to the firm that the village contractor gave us. They can still do it. Unfortunately, they want 50% down on the job before they'll start by the end of this year. The end of this year? That's in three weeks. -I'm so sorry. -It won't be easy. But Katie, I think because you have such enthusiasm, you have the perfect personality for this. You'll get people inspired. I can help get some of my elected officials involved, and I think we can get people to come and we can have a big fundraiser. A fundraiser? That's a great idea. -Thank you, Senator. -Thank you, Katie. I'm gonna start my morning tomorrow with a nice hot cup of coffee from Battle Alley. Battle Alley! Yes! Caramel macchiato, or a-- or a-- or a buttered rum. I can just smell it right now. I miss that smell walkin' in there every morning. I know. It's been way too long. You know what I miss? My bed. I just can't wait to get outta these boots. You take care, brother, okay? You too. -All right, see you later. -Stay safe. You too. -Hey, Tony. -Hey, Luke. How's civilian life treating you? Honestly, I'm not too sure yet. I just got back home in Holly and this is my first Christmas back here in a decade. Okay, well I'm not gonna take up too much of your time. We have an opening at the Chicago firm. Sales exec. And I think you would be great for it. Thanks, Tony, that's... really nice of you. Okay, well, we lookin' at flying you out for a tour next week. I just don't know if I could do it, though. Look, it's the same thing as when you were in the service, man. Persuading people and just talking to 'em. You know, I just got home, and... took a job with the fire department here in town. Can you really see me doing sales? Uh, okay, how about this, sleep on it. I'm going to be in Detroit for, like, three days next week. We'll sit down and have lunch, and pop in on you then. Okay? And Luke, I hope you're ready to make some serious cash. -Sure thing, Tony. -All right. - Hah-hah! - Hey, Jeff! No, no, no, bring it in here, man. Ah, you got it, baby. You didn't think we forgot about you, did you? Yeah, actually, for a minute there I didn't think anyone was coming to get me. Come on. You're Holly's hero. We pull out all the stops for you. I even got the heater fixed. I didn't want you to get a cold and everybody blames me. Well, don't spoil me now. I did figure my old man would come and get me, though. You know, he's the one that asked me to pick you up. You know, as chief of police, he's-- -he's a real busy man. -Yeah. And then we got all these last-minute preparations for the Christmas parade. -Kinda hard. -Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. In fact, speaking of your old man... did you tell him that you accepted a position with me at the fire department? Uh... You didn't tell him. Ah, he's the chief of police. If I told him I took a job at the fire department he'd probably disown me. You know, you're probably right. But I'll tell you this, better you than me, 'cause you're the one that's gonna tell him. Not me. All right. Let's get you home, guy. All right. I'll take it. Thank you. Oh, shoes! Okay. Hey, what's this I hear about you breaking into a holding cell in the police station and giving Billy and the chief trouble? They locked up Santa Claus. Put yourselves in my shoes, Judy. What would you have done? Okay, uh, first of all, that is grandma to you. And second, um, I'd let them do their jobs? Fine, but don't look at me when no one gets presents on Christmas. It was a nice old man dressed as Santa. So, did they let him out? Yes, they did. Well then, great. Christmas is saved. Not quite. We still have to find Cupid. With the bow and the arrow and the wings? I thought we were talking about Christmas. Santa's reindeer, Cupid! I know Szott's dealership were looking for real reindeer this year, so... probably has to do with that. Val! Luke's here! - Luke! - Welcome home, Luke. Hi, Valerie. Good to have you home, son. It's good to be home, Dad. Got dinner all ready for you. Oh, great. I'm starving. It's great, Valerie. Thank you. And... I ran into, uh, Katie, today. Have you had a chance to call her since you've been back? No, I have not. I mean, I would like to, but I don't think she'd wanna talk to me. Why wouldn't she wanna hear from you? I'm sure she'd love to see you. It's just complicated. I left to join the army. I was young and... it was right after my mom passed away. I probably could've handled things better. Well, if I was her, I'd for sure want to see you. Especially during Christmas. Thanks, Valerie. So, have you thought about work? Any idea what you wanna do? You know, I could always use another officer at the station. Uh... yeah, I, uh, I actually did find some work. Really? Fantastic. Whatcha doing? Well, you see, uh, Jeff... he reached out a couple weeks back and I, um... I sort of... accepted a position at the... -fire department. -You what? Chief Deckman told me a long time ago. -Congratulations. -You already knew? Of course. This is Holly. I have been stressing about this all week long. Cheers. Welcome home. Did you believe that Santa was real today? I honestly don't know, V. Could be. I'm gonna find Cupid. I have no doubt you are. Come on, let's get you tucked in. Can you sing me a song? Oh, I don't know. Maybe not-- Please! I'll go right to sleep and I won't get up and bug you. All right.

Katie... Valentine? Luke Murphy. Fireman. Oh... yeah. I'm sure your dad is thrilled. He's comin' around. Well, you always were good at putting out fires. Some of which being yours. Fair. Well, it looks like it's gonna be a while. You wanna grab a seat? Might as well. Great. So, how've you been, Luke? It's been a while. Just trying to get used to civilian life, really. Excited to be back home though. I'm at the fire station, workin' with Jeff and Jack. And I am the gofer today. -How about you? -Can't complain. I've been running the Holly Historical Society. Figures. What do you mean by that? Come on. Who did you used to drag with you to break into all those old buildings? It's true. I remember. I actually think that's pretty cool you're doing that. Well, thank you. You still singing? Me? Singing? No. Are you kidding? Why not? Luke, I don't do that anymore. It's been over eight years since I've last sung. Why? You were always talking about it when we were kids. You won Holly Idol. I always figured that I'd run into you on tour somewhere. Stop. I'm serious, Katie. You were really great. Why did you stop? I don't know. Life, I guess. Besides, it's not like I could just run off and start a life somewhere else. I'm joking. It's okay. I probably deserve that, anyway. But hey, if you still like singing, -you should do it. -I don't know. I haven't done it in so long, I don't know if I'd even like it anymore. Hey, you say that now. But I seem to remember a certain bar... that does a karaoke night. Not gonna happen. Besides, I gotta run. I gotta meet someone down at the train depot. You wouldn't wanna tag along, would you? Well, it's just around the corner. Come on. You might learn somethin'. I have not been in this place for years. It's a great, historic building. You know, Holly organically grew around this depot. If it weren't for that and the railroad, Holly might not even exist. Well, what do you think, Walter? It's a beautiful building. I-- it's in great shape. You know, I-- I left some things out in my car. Uh, let me go grab those, I'll be right back. Thanks, Walter. I can tell this place means a lot to you. I just love it here. All the old brickwork. And if you close your eyes, you can imagine it full of all sorts of people. All coming home to see their families on Christmas. - Ready? - Yeah. Well, I have to admit it... that was actually pretty interesting. Well, Holly is a pretty interesting place, believe it or not. It's just so awful that they're gonna tear down this train depot before the end of the month. Says who? Luke, I told you. The village. They just don't have enough money to relocate it right now. Well, I get that, but... who says you can't raise the money on your own? What do you expect me to do? Rob some banks? I don't know. Maybe you could throw a big Christmas fundraiser or something. Have a big party? Some bands? Good food? Dancing? There's enough people around who I'm sure would love to chip in. It's not a horrible idea. It's just that I don't know when I'd go about planning all that. It's not like I have much time. Maybe I could help. You? Yeah. Why not? I did some operations planning in the army. And I used to throw a pretty good party back in high school, didn't I? You did... but I think it's gonna have to be a little classier than that. Yeah, well, you'll have to help me with that part, but... I honestly think this could work. Hm. It's worth a shot, don't you think? And maybe you'll get a Christmas miracle or something. Yeah. It's worth a try. All right, I'll look into it, see what all needs to be done, and where we could hold it at. The Christmas parade is in a couple days, so it's gonna have to be after that. Well, think about it, let me know. Yeah. I will. Well, I better get headin' out. Told the fire chief that I'd pick him up some coffee before headin' over. I'll see you around though?

Well, you guys take care of this. Handle this. We got it, chief. Couple of things, rookie. First off, E.P.A. test. Gotta get done today.

Hey, by the way, meant to ask you, what are you doing Saturday? That's the day of the Christmas parade, so I was planning on being there-- No, no, no, no, no, I don't care what you were planning, I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna do. Okay? You see, the engine is gonna be in the parade. I'm gonna be on the top of the engine in the parade. You understand me? I need lights. Green, red. I need you to make it look like a moving Christmas tree. You know? And then I sit on it, I wave at the crowd-- - But I--- - No, no, no, no, no, no, you don't nothing. No, no. You don't-- you make it Christmasy. I sit on it. People applaud and yell and shout and I wave. - You won't be there. - Okay. Unless you wanna be in the crowd. But not on the engine. So you-- you make sure that you fix that up. Don't forget. A moving Christmas tree. - Sure thing. - You got that? All righty. - Absolutely. - Good. Don't let me down. Hey,. I told you I wanted hot chocolate. What is this? -Ah, just drink it. -Gosh. Oh, hey, Luke. How's it going? - Jack. - Hey, what's up, man? Hey. Fellas. -Hey, Chief. -Captain, how you doing? What brings you here? Well, I saw Luke's car out in the parking lot, and I thought, "You know, I would stop by and watch my only son betray me by signing up with the fire department." Sorry, Dad. Ah, it's all right. You guys do know why God created police officers, right? No. So firefighters could have heroes. That's fair. That's fair. Well, if firefighting was so easy, then they'd have cops do it. - Oh. - Right chief? Oh, you're kidding. Aw, right through the heart. You're woundin' me. Hey, Luke, do me a favor, would you? Run these by Judy Valentine and have her sign these permits. I mean, I would do it, but I'm a cop, and I actually have work to do. Oh, God. See you, Chief. -Got some work to do. -See you later. Didn't you fail the police academy? That's messed up. Hey, it's me, Holly Hutton, and I am here with Katie Valentine. President of the Holly Historical Society, also head of the DDA. And you're here today because I heard there's a huge problem. -Can you tell us about that? -Yes. Holly, thank you so much for helping us spread the word. We are currently in dire need of a contractor to help us relocate and renovate our beloved Holly Train Depot. If anyone out there knows of anyone reputable that we can use for this project, we are currently accepting bids, and we'd like to speak with them as soon as possible. Okay, so, you can call the radio station if you know of anyone, if you can help. And if that person happens to be attractive and-- and single, uh, Katie, I heard you're-- you're available. Your mom called. Uh, Holly, we can talk about this later. Okay, well, we'll be back with more music with Paulina Jayne after this. Carousel Acres, this is Mady. Yeah, hi, Mady, this is officer Billy Mortimer with the Holly Police Department. Listen, I just wanted to reach out and see if, uh, you guys happen to be missing any of your animals? Because we've been gettin' some weird sightings. Calls about reindeer. And I wanted to make sure it wasn't one of yours. Yeah, no, I'm positive we have ours. We actually had three triplet goats born today. Well, they sound very cute. Yeah, all of the horses, ducks, goats, sheep. Um, the foxes and the emu, and the kangaroo. We have everything.

It was nice to see him and all, but I don't know. It was just a strange feeling. Well, he was always such a sweet boy. And he's become quite a fine young man. Did you guys talk about going out? Mom! Do I need to remind you that I was dating him, and then he up and left town ten years ago? It was strange. Has he changed? No. That's the thing. He's the same sweet, funny guy that he was before he left. Sweetheart, someone that important to you doesn't just show back up in your life for no reason. -You can't ignore that. -Well, I don't know. There's just... there's a lot of history there. Coming from the girl obsessed with history. That's true. But I don't know, there's so much going on right now.

No, it's not like that. I'm here to get the permits signed for the parade. I'm just messin'. Come on in. -Luke! -Mrs. Valentine. So good to see you. -How are you? -Good. Call me Judy. My dad asked me to come by and bring you these. Perfect. Will we see you at the parade? -I wouldn't miss it. -Awesome. It is going to be the best one ever. Yeah, that's what everyone keeps telling me. Katie tells me she ran into you earlier today. Yeah. She even gave me a VIP tour of the train depot. -I bet she did. -Yeah. Speaking of which, Katie, I reached out to the banquet hall in town and I'm pretty sure I can get us a spot reserved for Friday before Christmas. -You did? -Banquet hall? What's this? Oh, we might be holding a fundraiser to save the Holly Depot. Well, not "maybe." We're definitely doing it. And not "fundraiser." "Christmas gala." Ooh, Christmas gala. I like the sound of that. Luke, you didn't have to do all that. I know, I know, but I wanted to. I was wondering if maybe you wanted to get together tomorrow, we can go over it? -Sure. -Okay, great. I just have to figure out a few things first, then I can text you? Sure, I'll take your phone. -Here's my number. -Thank you. Well, I will talk to you tomorrow, and it is very nice to see you Mrs. V. Judy. And why don't you stay and help us finish decorating the tree? Oh, I don't wanna intrude. I'm sure you're really busy. No, it's no bother. And we could use the help. Might as well. Well then, it's settled. Make yourself comfortable. Hey, what are you working on? - Missing posters for Cupid. - Who's Cupid? Santa's reindeer, Cupid! Haven't you heard of him? All right, I know all about Cupid. I didn't know he was missing though. Santa says he goes missing sometimes but shows up whenever there's true love. Hm, well, I'll keep a lookout for him. -I'm Luke, by the way. -I'm Olivia. It's very nice to meet you, Olivia. How do you know Aunt Katie? We're just old friends from a long time ago. Are you two in true love or what? Olivia! What? - Hey, Katie. - Hey, Francesco. I think I'm gonna need something strong today. Well, we have your favorites. We have Gianna Loren Rye and Luca Mariano Bourbon. I think I'm gonna go with my girl, Gianna Loren. Hey, hey. Gianna. You said it just like the Italians do. Parli Italiano? -Sì. Un poco. -Un poco, okay. Well, I'm gonna drink with you today. - Thank you. - I mean, it seems like there's something weighin' on your heart. Well, I ran into an old friend. Do you remember Luke? The, uh, police chief's son? Didn't he leave, like, ten years ago? I think he's here to stay. Does he know about your niece, Olivia, and what happened? Yeah. I think he's heard. He was always like a child, and you became a single mother overnight. Yeah. And I just-- I don't know if he's ready for all that. Take it one day at a time. Yes, I''m gonna take it one day at a time. Hey, buddy. Hey, Cupid. Shoot. No, no, no, no, no. Stay. Hey, chief, I got him. Uh, Cupid, the reindeer. He's right here in front of me. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do, do I cuff him?

Oh, maybe that's why the bill's so high. So, I don't wanna pat ourselves too hard on the back yet, but I'm pretty sure we're gonna be able to pull this off and save this old place. Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I'm serious. - That's great. Hey. Listen, Luke. I can't thank you enough. Everything you''ve been doing, it's amazing. -Thank you. -Yeah. I'm just happy I could help. So-- do you hang out here often? - Yeah. - Uh, it's. It's kinda my place. I just-- I love it here. It's quiet, it's peaceful. No one's bothering me. Yeah. It's my place. Hm. Am I being weirder? No. Not at all. You know, some girls, you know, when they get stressed, they like to-- buy fancy clothes or watch bad romance movies, but you-- you like to squat in old, abandoned buildings. It's totally normal. Okay, I'm guilty. I love that. Really? Yeah, really. You have a real passion. I love that. Hmm, well, it doesn't sound like you love it. It sounds weird. No. You know, really. I think that's something that everybody needs. Well, thank you. What about you? What's yours? My what? - Your passion. - Hm. I'm not sure. Come on. You can't always play Mr. International Man of Mystery. I don't know. I've held so many jobs over the years in the service, and... nothin' ever really clicked for me. There's gotta be somethin'. Well, you know... ten years ago, when my mom passed, uh... I was so lost and scared. I really wanted to help her, but I couldn't. I just-- I never felt so powerless. Guess I couldn't handle it, so I-- I left. Joined the army, I just... tried not to give a second thought to anyone that I was leavin' behind. But I did, I-- I thought about everyone. I thought about them all the time, my Dad. I thought about you. And I always wanted to reach out, but... what was I gonna say? I had so much guilt, and I just felt like it was something that I had to do. The only time that I ever really... truly-- felt happy. Truly passionate with what I was doing... was when I was helping people. Hm. But we had done natural disaster cleanup for a while, and-- those people... they had lost everything. And just being able to offer something to them. Rescue a pet, or even just... find an old picture album to return to them. Anything to make them feel a little bit more normal. You know? They wouldn''t always even say anything, but... you know, you-- you-- you could see it in their eyes that... that it made a difference to them. Even just a-- a little bit. And that, that always made me feel really good. I'm sorry, I'm rambling. I guess what I'm trying to say... is that maybe I'm passionate about helping people. I don't even know if any of that made sense. That made perfect sense. -Yeah? -Yeah. Luke-- you've helped me so much this week. -Yeah. -And I''m so thankful for that. Listen, I gotta go help my mom pack up the car with the Christmas decorations. Need a hand? I'm starting to feel like your boss or something. Uh, no, no. You should take the night off. Whatever. But are you gonna go to the Christmas parade tomorrow? Yeah, of course. All right. Maybe I'll see you there. Absolutely.

He's so sketchy. -Is it Rudolph? -What if it's Vixen? -But you guys believe in Santa? -Who still believe in Santa? Seriously, nobody does at this age. -I do. -You do?

It's been a while. What? You afraid? No. I'm not. You're all smiles today. Thanks, Veronica. Okay, so, you're not gonna tell me about how the other night went? Oh. I didn't think you cared. Why wouldn't I wanna hear about your hot date with the handsome hometown hero? I'm kidding. Veronica, it went great. Yes! What did you do? Oh, we just walked around town. We went antiquing. We went skiing. Um, he's not that great at it, but that's okay. And then we ended up at Blackthorn for dinner. Oh, that sounds amazing. Oh, did I tell you I have a date to the Christmas gala? You did not. Who are you going with? Remember the parade yesterday? The handsome firefighter. Not yours, but the other one. Are you talking about Jack Ryan? Yeah. Oh! He is such a sweetheart. Sounds like Santa brought you everything you asked for this year. He's a triple threat. He has a car, a job, and he's cute. I guess I was really good this year. I would say. So, what do I owe you? Don't worry about it. I'm assuming the other drink is for Luke? Hm. Are you sure? You do give me a lot of free coffee. I mean, it's probably not the best for business, but you pay me in gossip. Well, thank you. You have a good one. Thanks. -Ah. -Hi, Katie. -How are you today? -Hi, Mr. Murphy. I'm doing great. Um, is Luke in? He told me to meet him here. Uh, no, yeah, he is. He's just-- he ran to the print shop. He's gonna be right back. Come on into the office, have a seat. Um, it's a new office, it's kinda blah. Maybe you can help me decorate it? So-- just a few more days until the big Christmas gala. Yep. Friday. Ah, I just hope enough people show up. I'm a little nervous. It's gonna be just fine. In fact, listenin' to Luke talk, he thinks you're gonna be-- Hi. Can I help you? Yes, uh, you wouldn't happen to be Luke Murphy's father, -would you? -I am. Okay, um, is he around anywhere? Uh, he's not. Oh, man. Sorry, hey, my name's Tony. I was stationed with Luke in Riverside. Hi, Tony. Chief Richard Murphy. -Nice to meet you. -Very nice to meet you. And I'm Katie, I'm his-- His, uh, girlfriend, actually. Oh. Lucky guy. Well, Luke told me so much about you, so I figure I would stop up here and surprise him. Well, you know what, I'm glad you did. He's not here right now, but he's on his way back. And, uh, what is it you wanted to see Luke about? Uh, are you staying for Christmas? No, no, no, I'm just here on business. Oh, what kind of business you in? I'm with Bluth Consulting in Chicago. I just came to finalize some paperwork, and hopefully we can get it all sorted out before Christmas. F-finalize for what? Oh, we're bringing him on board as a sales exec. Yeah, oh, he''s gonna be a natural at it, man. I mean, such a way with words this guy has. Luke, in sales? Oh, he didn't tell you? Oh, this is a sweet gig. I mean, we're talkin' six figures. Money is no issue. He'll have to relocate to Chicago. I'm sorry. Moving to Chicago? He hasn't told you-- Um, yeah, don't worry, I looked at a bunch of properties for him and everything, and I mean-- all luxury places. Nice digs. Uh-- I-- I'm sorry, I gotta go. Katie. Oh. Is it somethin' I said? Uh, no, it's not you. Hey, sorry I'm late! I was getting some more flyers printed out for the big event. Katie! Is everything all right? Luke. I can't talk to you right now. Katie! Katie. Look, I am really sorry to keep calling you, but this is all just a big misunderstanding. I can explain it all, I promise. Please. Call me back. Hey. Hey. Thought I might find you here. Can I have a seat? Luke, what do you want? Just to explain things. Like, explain how you're moving to Chicago? Well, I don't even know if I'm gonna be doing that. Look... Tony is an old friend, and he hit me up about a really good job opportunity. But I never told him I was gonna be taking it. He just-- came in town, tried to get me to sign on. Well, are you gonna take it? I don't know. I don't think so. I just told him I would hear him out. -But that was before. -Before what? I've been getting to spend all this time with you. I'm really sorry. No. No, it's my fault. I should've known better, and I should've learned. Luke... I loved you when we were kids. And I was heartbroken when you left. But I knew it was important... and I was happy for you. And now that you're back in my life, and all those feelings. Like-- it's like something awoke in me, and I feel like I'm 17 again. I just-- I felt like there was so much potential there. Katie. I feel the same way. I really do. Luke, you don't even know what you want. I need something dependable. I need someone that's gonna be around tomorrow and ten years from now. You can depend on me, I swear. I gotta go. Katie, wait. You know, I brag about you all the time. -What? -I do. To all my friends. Have I ever told you that? No. It's because I'm so proud of the man that you have grown into be. Thanks, Dad. Luke, you have been all around the world. You have seen things and done things I can't imagine. And now you're back home again. Small town. And maybe this isn't where you thought you would end up. Maybe it is, I don't know. But I do know this. Just down the road, there is a woman that loves you. -I don''t think she wants-- -Let me finish. Now, you might think that this kind of thing happens all the time. Love. Listen to me. It doesn't. And while you're sittin' here thinkin' that love is gonna pass you by, and I really hope that doesn't happen. Because... I''ll tell you this, you're not gonna get a third chance. I gotta go. Hey, Dad. I think I will go to the gala. There he is. If you're gonna win her back-- do not dress like that. Well, you sure as fate can't go dressed like that. ♪ Working, playing ♪ ♪ Dancing, swaying ♪ ♪ Rocking and rolling ♪ ♪ That's why they make beer ♪ Mom, I don't need a new car.

Oh, look, Santa got me a gift! Wow, where do you think that came from? -I don't know. -Hi, Katie! Hi, Santa. Been staying out of trouble I hope? Oh, gosh, yes. I just come here today, I've got my new set of wheels. -Zero money down. -Wow. I still like my sleigh. Well, I know Olivia's very happy to see you. That reminds me, there is this young man, and he was, like, really eager that I give you this letter. Oh. Hm. Ten years ago, I told you that I'd be with you forever, and I left. You deserve someone that's gonna be there for you. I want this whole town. I want Christmas. I want all of it. And I want us. Thank you, Santa. I've got somewhere to be. -And someone to see? -Yes. Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! Are you ready? I'm just nervous. I hope everyone shows up. They will. Oh, Olivia! Katie, you look so pretty. -So do you. -Thank you. I would like to introduce-- Chaplain Silvers, to come and lead us in an invocation for the evening. Thank you very much. Would you please bow in prayer together with me tonight. Our gracious, heavenly Father. You are so good to us. We thank you that you are the one that provides joy in our souls, the pep in our step, and the song in our hearts. And so, we gather tonight, as we strive to raise the resources necessary for a relocation project for the historic Holly Union Depot. Amen. -Hi, Katie. -Thank you, Richard. You're welcome. Hey, mom, if you''re out there, could you come up here? I wanna share this with you. First off, thank you all for coming. Anyone that knows me knows that I am such a fan of history. It's so important to me, and I am humbled to look out there and see so many that feel the same. We did it! We raised the money! Thank you all so much.
