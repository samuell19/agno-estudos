So Cedrick, are you gonna contribute to the conspiracy by the white man to bring down the black man by serving this shit the blue-eyed-devil call pork? - Yeah, well actually I was just in charge of inviting the peoples.

There was enough shit in that house to make a dookie pot pie. I got my shit and I left. So ever since I left Shea's house that day, I never looked at her with a romantic eye again. I mean being the gentleman I am I never brought the shit up. No pun intended. Since then she been jocking. Bringing me cookies, cupcakes, calling me every hour on the hour, paging me 24/7, the whole nine. - That's deep Ced. I mean I heard some fine females have some stank pussy, but I ain't never heard nothing like this. - Man, please let me tell you something.

Did you cum? - Did I cum? - Did you climax? I mean, it's not a trick question, Latoya. - This is a barbecue Delron. I don't think this is the time or place to be talking about our sex life. - Oh, come on Latoya. I just wanna confirm what I already know. - What is that? - That I'm the greatest of all time! - You wanna know the truth? - Yeah, I'm a man. You know, give it to me raw. Don't sugar coat the shit for me. - Well no, I did not have an orgasm. - You didn't? - Did I stutter? - That's cool, you know? I mean, men can't get off all the time. You know what I'm saying?

You know I don't like them damn Star Wars creatures don't you son? - [Cedrick] Wait wait wait I'll get it, I'll get, I'll get it pops. Y'all been driving all day, you're tired. Sit down. (slow romantic melody) (muffled scream) D! What the fuck? - Get on up there. - Homie, Shea broke me off a little bit. She didn't even care if I had a petite dick. Man she saw me crying and she said she need a man that was sensitive. - Nigga get your naked asses up outta here! My parents is downstairs. (high tempo hip hop beat) (collective arguing) - [Cedrick] All you do is nag nag nag nag nag! - Yeah if you start doing what you're supposed to do I wouldn't have to nag your ass. - If I had $5 for every time you nagged me I'd be a rich motherfucker! What you doing boy? - Oh, I was just giving y'all a turn down. Check, check it. Skittles. Okay, I'm gonna get outta here so y'all can take a nap, but first I want you to see what I did to the bathroom to welcome you home. ♪ Doo Doo Brown ♪ Twice twice ♪ Doo Doo brown Look to the left of the toilet. It's two ply! ♪ Twice twice ♪ Doo Doo brown (chuckles) - I don't know what you're up to but at least you did clean the bathroom while we was gone. - [Robin] The whole house gone crazy! (loud smash) - What was that noise Cedrick? - Oh, I'm sure it was probably nothing. You kids get some rest and I'll go check it out. (hip hop beat) - Robin didn't I tell you about eating in this bed. There are crumbs everywhere. - I told you, I don't be eating in the bed. - Well, I haven't been eating in the bed and you're the only other person sleeping in it. You had to do it. - Denise, I haven't had nothing in this bed since 1976. What I ate your ass! What the hell? - Who the hell are those? Cause they sho' ain't mine! - We know they ain't yours, shit. You can't get a finger in these much less your big ass. Whoever it is, they need to wipe their ass. - [Both] Cedrick! ♪ I like the way you shake that ass ♪ ♪ I like the way you shake, shake, shake that ass ♪ ♪ I like the way you shake it ♪ I like the way you shake it ♪ I like the way I like the way ♪ ♪ I like the way I like the way ♪ ♪ I like the way you shake that ass ♪ ♪ Freak nasty ♪ Wouldn't be caught with the booty getting past me ♪ ♪ 2000 zero zero ♪ Just add me ♪ Shake that ass ♪ Shake that ass for daddy ♪ Hot male top down ♪ Creeping up real slow ♪ Another ass in the cut ♪ All good to go ♪ See that body ♪ Got my eyes open ♪ Please stop ♪ Shake that ass over here on my block ♪ ♪ Having fantasies with a playa ♪ ♪ See you shaking that ass in the Q ♪ ♪ Like you don't care ♪ I'm addicted to your attitude ♪ ♪ I ain't trying to be rude ♪ But that booty got me in the mood ♪ ♪ I guess it only take a little time ♪ ♪ Between the weed and the wine ♪ ♪ Something bout that ass got me blind ♪ ♪ So come and stand right in ♪ Front of me ♪ Turn around, shake, shake, shake ♪ ♪ That ass till a nigga leave ♪ I like the way you shake that ass ♪ ♪ I like the way you shake, ♪ Shake shake that ass ♪ I like the way you shake it ♪ I like the way you shake it. ♪ I like the way ♪ I like the way ♪ I like the way ♪ I like the way ♪ I like the way you shake that ass ♪ ♪ Freak nasty ♪ Wouldn't be caught with the booty getting past me ♪ ♪ 2000 zero zero ♪ Just add me ♪ Shake that ass ♪ Shake that ass for daddy ♪ I carry heart break ♪ My baby mama tore it up ♪ My mans watching ♪ I love the way she throw it up ♪ ♪ Tear dropped ♪ I used to cry heavily ♪ Now I'm at the Q with a thick ass ♪ ♪ Ahead of me ♪ H-dub hit me with a six pack ♪ She got ass ♪ I love the way the tits stack ♪ ♪ I got pain but the way she keeps bouncing ♪ ♪ Move's mountains next girl I'm denouncing ♪ ♪ Pop the butt I love the way her butt swang ♪ ♪ She got more body than a 99' Mustang ♪ ♪ Tasting her game by the cat ♪ Can't sweat her fire ♪ Cheat and then telling you lies like a leprechaun ♪ ♪ I like the way you shake that ass ♪ ♪ I like the way you shake ♪ Shake shake that ass ♪ I like the way you shake it ♪ I like the way you shake it ♪ I like the way ♪ I like the way ♪ I like the way ♪ I like the way ♪ I like the way you shake that ass ♪ ♪ Freak nasty ♪ Wouldn't be caught with the booty getting past me ♪ ♪ 2000 zero zero just add me ♪ Shake that ass ♪ Shake that ass for daddy ♪ Shake that ass ♪ Shake that ass shake it ♪ It's big can you take it for real ♪ ♪ Don't fake it ♪ Bounce bounce ♪ As we roll in my house ♪ About to blaze into ♪ A whole ounce ♪ Big booty ♪ Come sit down on my couch ♪ Do it to me screw me truly ♪ Barbecue on the grill ♪ Busting season on my chest ♪ One two mic check ♪ Got all this here ♪ Between your blue jeans ♪ Peep the scene ♪ Lost in your sauce ♪ Stuck to your butt, ♪ Up in your guts ♪ How y'all feeling out there. ♪ It's versatile Red eye ♪ Jedi getting busy ♪ I'm in the studio you know what I mean ♪ ♪ RSVP production getting biz for nine eight ♪ ♪ How you feeling ♪ Snake brought your finger Aye ♪ ♪ Jump off the cliff. ♪ Bungee with the gift ♪ Swift facts ♪ Not a myth ♪ Well equipped the Jedi ♪ East the nine admire ♪ I'm focused on the vision ♪ Reflected in the prism ♪ Effectively alism off of clues ♪ ♪ Who's the figure ♪ Take a picture ♪ Remember ever clever verbal ♪ On the curve puffing herbal ♪ Smoke flesh and finesse ♪ From the chest no rest ♪ I relax when stress is ♪ Less sacrifessed ♪ Yes yes y'all ♪ Kick the ball over the moon ♪ Supernova ♪ Quay Zar maneuvers ♪ Let's move ♪ A lyrical literal display ♪ In 3D degree we check ♪ 1, 2, 3, 4 affinity ♪ Propel in history ♪ Futuristic and majestic ♪ Publicly elected cassettes on sale for retail ♪ ♪ With email from my crib in Brazil ♪ ♪ How it feel ♪ Stick a butter finger ♪ Ooh Hershey's ♪ Mercy mercy ♪ And never thirsty ♪ Satisfied from inside ♪ Like candy in the wrapper ♪ Yeah, I peep you over there in your platinum tie ho ♪ ♪ You know ♪ Ghetto fabulous got you all curious baby ♪ ♪ But you ain't gotta have a lot of money to be a black cat ♪ ♪ You know what I'm saying?
