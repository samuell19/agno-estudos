- What man? - I came the other way. - Don't worry. - What's going on? - You ask too many questions. - Come on. Come on! Hey, calm down. - What's up? - Hey, what's up? Enough with you. It's always you. - What's up? Let him go. - No! Let me give dad a kiss. How are you, son? What about me? Is that a new cellphone? It's awesome. It's yours, if you want. - Yeah? - Here. Why? What's wrong with you? It's legit. - Yeah, just like you. - Dad. - Slim, come on. - Slim! You're not finished eating. He acts tough now. But who pays for stuff? Yeah, I know. He's worried. That's why he talks that way. Yeah. - How's school? - Nothing new. It's like I'm from another planet. That's right, bro! From planet Mars. You can't shake it off. It's for life. And what about your exams? - Yeah. - Yeah? I'll pass. But it's weird sometimes. I don't know. I feel I don't belong. You've been there three years! Yeah, I know. Stop worrying. Get your degree, that's all. - What about you? - I'm OK. Stop touching all my stuff. I'm no longer manager. I'm with Rachid. Oh, all right! I get it now. - Huh? - They wanted you. That shooting was only Farouk's way of impressing us. What Farouk? That other guy. Who owns the turf in Sensba? Yes. That lunatic. - What will you do? - Stay out of it. Move over. Remember our promise before you went to Lyon? Then do as we said. I get the money. You get the degree. And we'll launch our own business. - Show me your reflexes. - Idiot. - Reflex! - Idiot. Show me your arms. Show me Wanderlei Silva. Here, take this. Show them your pain. - Guys! Sofiane and Slim are here. - Hey, Sofiane! - Hi. - It's been a while. - What's up? - Hey. - Hey. - Hey, bro. What's up, bro? Look at that. Things are tense here. Don't linger. Hey, So! Back to the hood? Just for a couple of weeks. How are you, bro? What's up? I saw your snack bar on TV... Motherfucker. Let's go, now. Put the ladder away. - Sure. - Where are you going? - Watch the TMAX. - Can I come? No. You look like a fucking peasant. Looking good! You look hot. Where'd you get your clothes? Who is it? - Hey! What's up? - My brother! What's up? What's new with you? - I'm happy to see you. - Same. Still on the corner? Yeah! What can you do? - How are you? - I'm fine. You've changed. What's with the look? - You peasant. - You smell like pony, cuz. Where have you been? You already fucked up Slim's TMAX? Want a ride? I have things to do. Just give me a lift. Let's go. Hey! Don't come back with those clothes! 300 tons of cannabis a month. 300 tons! Fuck! Hey, kiddo! - Hey, Sofiane! - What's up? - Hey, man! When did you get here? - Yesterday. - Got a TMAX? - Slim's. - I can get you one. - No. - So? - What's going on? Take a look at my palace. - I'm happy to see you. - It's been a while. Where's your wife? - My wife? - Yes. I never saw her. In BÃ©ziers. You got pictures? - No pictures. - Right there. That's my wife. - You ladies' man. - Yeah. You womanizer. - And school? - Good. - Good? - Yes. Is it hard? Is it going well? - What's so funny? - I don't know. You want a favor. - How do you know? - I know you. Your brain works funny. - I'm on something big. - Yeah? Something with a guy. From Aix. Heavy stuff, cars. - What car? - BMW. - What BMW? - Last model. The 7 Series? So? - Does it pay? - Yes. 4,000. Two grands each. Zero risk. No cops. So? Do it with me. Ask Coyote. He's afraid of cops. You're the best, Sofiane. Do it. I can't. What? - Why? - I'm done with that. Done with what? - This. - Why? Because. You look like a bum. Brand names! And I have a TMAX. It's your brother's. So what? Is the trailer yours? - It is. - You gypsy. - Stop it! - Or what? Want to see how this gypsy lives? - Go on, make me hard. - Go fuck yourself. Look at this. Look. Don't forget this. Wallah, Sofiane. Take it. Here. Take it. - I don't want it. - You don't? You're weird. I quit. Hey! What are you doing? Testing the material. That's some firepower. Let me try. - No. - Just a couple. You're too little. Hey, want to try? - No. - Let me try. - Come on, blow the place up. - You bet. There are children here! What are you doing? I can't talk with you. This is our territory. You get it? Oh! What about your promise? Leila! Hey! The shoes for the kid! - More. - Stop it. - What? - She's big. Leila, stop it. - Slimane, come here. - No time, mom. I'm talking to you. - Come here, I said. - Leave me alone. You take his money! - Chill out. - Chill out? Aren't you ashamed? So, you're playing golf now? - Did you see his clothes? - His polo? And you and your makeup? Going to a rally? - She's not going out. - She stays home. He gets all the meat? Sure. He's her favorite. He's my son. We can starve to death. You're not there yet. You're all puffed up. What did you say? Do you want a smack in your face? Hello? Be right down. Back in 2 minutes. - What now? - I won't be long. Cover up his plate, please. Did you see that? Trust him. We're soon going to start a fully legit business. Really! A healthy halal snack bar. Healthy and halal. Is that compatible? - Sure. - How? That's precisely the power of our concept. What concept? What's that? Concept, scams, schemes... I don't want zigzags. The road... Is straight. Yes! It's straight. What's the name? It's a restaurant chain. "So Slim." - Can I work too? - Yes. But first you'll graduate, go to college, and then you'll work with us. Did you hear what Sofiane said? School first. OK? Sofiane, your train! Hurry up! So. You know, Slim, he'd never have gone down. - He knew them. - Stop it. - Of course he did. - Stop it. Fuck, it... it hurts. It hurts so fucking much. They knew Slim. They even might have been at his funeral. They came over. Your brother knew what he was doing. What does that mean? Huh? I'm talking to you. - Seriously? - What does that mean? My brother deserved to die? I'm sorry, forgive me. No news for a year. You come over, we fuck, and here we go again? You didn't like it? Wasn't it good? - Why are you in Marseille? - Stop it! You're stubborn. I told you. I need some time. - I don't get it. - What? Time for what? To know what happened. - What will that do? - I'll be able to grieve. You understand that? I'm sorry. OK. I'll go back to Lyon. On one condition. What? That you come with me. My studies mean nothing? I never said that. It's you, Sofiane! How are you? Is it for Marteau? Good luck waking him. - Hurry up, kids. - You have everything? What's up? Why aren't you in Lyon? There are some things I need to understand. What's the beef with Farouk? Don't worry about that, you know we're on it. Stick to your studies. You don't like me being around. Don't get involved. Knuckle under. Don't say what I didn't say. Just don't get involved. What would you do? If it were your brother? Nothing? Who's this Farouk? Slim told you. Farouk wanted to tax you. - That's the story. - Just like that? Look, So. I can't make things up just to please you. We'll get the motherfucker. Slim will get his revenge. Do you know what they call Reda? The roaster. Why do you think that is? Don't worry, bro. - What, now? - I'm coming. No, don't come with me. Why not? - Just don't. - Why not? Hey, man. Feeling better? I thought you were going back to Lyon. No. I'm taking a break. What's this about Slim and Farouk? Are you looking for trouble? - I told you, it's business. - Yeah, he told me. That's what it was. But then, what happened? - We just told you. - Business, I know. Just like when he blew up your snack bar? - What? - What's with you? My brother died last week. And he's grilling sausages. Are you talking to me? Come on, let's talk. Come on. Settle down, Rach. - Thanks. - Why'd you bring him? - He lives here. - Fuck. I'll kill you both. I have a right to know what happened. What happened? Slim was my brother too. - He'll get his revenge. - When? When the time is right. I'll be here. - What? - I'll wait here. What about your mom? Huh? What will you tell her? You're dropping out of school to stay here? You want to kill her twice? Is that it, Sofiane? Huh? Get off my back. Latifa, can you help me out? You know I'm bad at maths. Nassim, can you help me? Are you stuck? Show me. Look. Take 7 kilos out of 370. That makes 363. OK? Divide that by how many? By 605 boxes. There. Do the maths. Shoes on the furniture. What is this, Nassim? You didn't give me any money for the cafeteria. The electricity bill has been lying here for weeks. Thanks. Latifa, when you're done, come help me in the kitchen. I got it. Write it down. After me. A-Z-H, A-Q-L, B-H-D. You hear, Leo? - Gato! - Yeah? - What's up? - Teaching him license plates. How'd you get him? Swapped him for a pitbull. Fire! Fire! You don't run? No. It's Rudolph and the Armenian, corrupt cops. Arrah! Arrah, Bamboula! Each week, those whores tax our biz. You're the whores. - They're the pimps. - What's with you? Customs? Those motherfuckers took everything. How much did you make? Beat it. Rachid is going to show up. - You're scared of Rachid? - Fuck off, I said. And you, warn me first! - I said they were coming. - I don't care, warn me. Let's work together. Blow everything away. We'll see. I'm fingering her deep. What do I find? A pierced condom. It turned me down. What d'you know? Farouk is nothing compared to Reda. I have to think it through. Think what through? - What about Farouk? - I'm on it. I'll see you tomorrow anyway. - Yeah. - All right. Bye. You think this is IKEA? Get to work! All right, So? Not too bored? I need some money. I get it, bro. - Here. - Make me work. - Work where? - On the corner. Who d'you take me for? Are you kidding? You don't belong. Trust me, be patient. What's Reda waiting for, with Farouk? Are you serious? He's on it. If he doesn't, I will. This shit makes you feel strong. - I'll tear them apart. - Settle down! - I'll tear them apart. - Stop it, Marteau! Picture his face. Stop it, Marteau! Stop! - What's up, Gato? - Hey. - Is it crowded on the corner? - As usual. - Let me in. - I can't. - Come on. - Give it up. Still staying at Marteau's? Why do you ask that? I see your mom go by, she's looking for you. Don't worry, I'm on it. Slim was a brother to me. Like blood. He always helped me, treated me good. So. I know where Farouk is. How do you know? My cousin works near the opera, he sees him in a bar. Don't tell me what you'll do. - Don't worry. - Please. It's between us. Or else, I'm a dead man. Reda, can we talk? I'm busy. What's up? I know where you can get that son of a bitch. Really? I swear on my mom's life. Now the time is right, Reda. Sofiane. Do you really think I need you to get to Farouk? Huh? I can get him when I want, where I want. I told you, didn't I? If I get him now, I'm dead. Is that what you want? I'll tell you one last time, Sofiane. I'm in charge of this. Understood? Fuck, I didn't know you were afraid. Fuck! - What did you say? - You won't do anything. - What, now? - Yes, now. It's an opportunity! Now is when you can kill him. - Sofiane. - On a silver platter. Be patient! Be patient! Don't worry. One day you'll hear the son of a bitch is dead. Hey, bro! Now, go. Go! You shut up! Shut it! When I tell you to give ass, you do as I say. OK? Shut up! You shut up! I own this place. Don't forget it, bitch. Farouk! Why did you kill him? - Who are you? - Why? - Huh? - Why'd you kill him? Who are you talking about? Who are you? Help! Help! Help! Help! One question remains. Why did this shootout go down in the center of Marseille, usually spared by these gunfights between rival drug gangs? Are you sure it was him? Farouk was in the parking lot. He was involved in a lot of stuff. What do we do? Whose turn is it? You OK, Marteau? Yeah, I'm OK. - Be right back. - We just started. I'm going to the bathroom. - You heard of anything? - Nothing. I hope I'm not bothering you. I was like you, before I went to jail. Couldn't take a leak in public. Just couldn't. But 5 years, 5 years of shitting every day in front of 2 guys. It changes a man. Come on! Let it out. I can't. Stay here. Let it out, I said. Go on! Try harder. Come on! Let it flow. Come on, talk. It's not me. So took my gun. Run, run! Let me go, motherfuckers. Get down! What did I do? Fuck off! - Not so tight. - Shut up! Let me go! Let me go! Shut up! Let me go! Come on, your ID. - Don't have it. - Give it. - Come on! - Let's go! Take your hands away. Here. Don't play smart. Take the dog away. This is our territory. Motherfuckers, fuck off! Sons of bitches! - What's up? - A new prefect. He want to stop the biz? He's just showing off. New prefect, new strategy, new policies. Zero tolerance. Naturally, you're on the list. Your little war... - I'm not at war with anyone. - Really? How stupid was it to try and get Farouk downtown? Don't look at me like that. If it was me, would I have missed? - It's why we're warning you. - Of what? Maybe you should be doing some roasting around you. Until things settle down a bit. - Get it? - Absolutely. - That's good. - Fuck off. - So? - I didn't see him. I called, he didn't answer. You have nothing to say? Now what do we do, Sofiane? You want to play it on your own? I don't know. You don't? - What about my gun? - I threw it away. What? - I threw it away. - My gun? OK, drive. Get out. Get out. I said, get out. Marteau, tell me, please. Marteau! Move it. This is all because of you. - Settle down, Rachid! - No. He'll learn to make amends. - Right, So? - Son of a bitch! - What's going on? - He disgusts me. You wanted him. Kill him, if you can. Now's the time. I'll do it. No, no. He needs to learn. Here, Sofiane. - Go on! - Kill that motherfucker. There's no time, come on! You think he hesitated with Slim? Come on, he's yours. Sofiane, take a deep breath. Come on, kill him. For your brother. Come on, kill him. So, he made your mother cry. Think of Slim, zebi. Shoot! Come on! Fuck it, I can't! I can't! - I can't! - You can't? Give it. Give it. Chouf. Here, So. You do the honors. Don't worry. The first is always the hardest. You get used to it. Come on, let's go. What are you doing here? I told you not to come at work, Sofiane. And you're high. - Najette. - OK. - Who is it? - He's leaving. - He's leaving now. - Yes. What's wrong? Hold on, So. I'm at work. I'm at work. I didn't want this. - What? - Get him out. - I'm handling it. - Now. - He's distracting us. - OK. Stop. - I'll tell him. - Tell him what? I don't get it, Sofiane. Wait for me at the cafe. I'll be off in an hour. - Wait for me downstairs. - This way. Watch out. You can't just barge in here. Come on! - Hey! Where were you? - What? At a friend's. What did you do? - Come on. - Get in. - Stop. - Get in, I said. I said get in. Get in! What did you tell him? What did you say? Nothing, I swear. What did you say? What did you say? - Tell us. - What? Hey! Let me go! Reda, Reda. - Who's your friend? - Talk! - He's a friend. - Talk! A friend from downtown. - Did you talk? - I swear I didn't. Stop swearing. On my mother's life! Let me go! If you talk, you're dead. Get it? Motherfucker. All right, go. He scared you, huh? I'm done, I'm done. Let me tell you, I'm done. - Done with what? - Everything. OK? Did I risk my head for you, or what? Huh? Did I do what you couldn't? - Did I? - I know. You don't know squat, Sofiane. Nothing. Because of you, we've got every cop in Marseille on our tails. There's no proof. There's nothing! You think Farouk's brothers need proof? Huh? Think they need proof to kill you? I'm talking to you. Fuck! If you'd listened to me, we wouldn't be here. Look at me when I'm talking. Look at me when I'm talking. I know how you feel. Don't worry, So. You can't fall apart now. Farouk wasn't alone when he killed Slim. Now that we've started, we can't back down. Marteau! You're going to work. It's what you wanted, right? Take him. Come on. Stop crying. Do you have rolling paper, So? What's that? Come on, who's the strongest? Huh? Who's the boss? Who's the boss? Huh, kiddo? What's up? Wake up, serve the customers. - What is it? - A 20. A 20? Here. - You'll be back. - Thanks. Farouk got hit. It's been on the news non-stop for hours. Hey, shut up. Blondie, sit down. A burnt body was discovered today. When I arrived, I saw a dark lump. I went to look. I thought some friends had cooked a barbecue. I realized it was a body. It was horrible. I called the police. Upon their arrival, the police found a 9 mm cartridge case currently being analyzed. - Where are you going? - For a ride. Better not wander off. Can't I go for a stroll? Stay with us. It's best, I tell you. - Why? - Ask Reda. - Why? - Ask Reda. Fuck! Hello, Najette? I can't make it. No, I can't. I can't. Who is it? Sofiane, some girl for you. What are you doing? - What's up? - Don't come here. Let me go. You're in deep trouble. Najette, I can't explain. Go home. Who are you scared of? Don't make this hard. Let me go. Let me go. You're the one who came to get me. I almost got fired because of you. Now you want me to go? - Quiet down. - What? I'll quiet down when I want to. - Who is it? - No one. Let me go. You think I'm your whore? - What's with the lunatic? - Who are you talking to? You let him talk this way? She's going. - You coward. - I'll call you. Don't call me. You're batshit crazy. - Did you disrespect me? - She's got your balls. She's making both of us crazy. You lunatic. I swear. - Marteau! - What? Open up. - What was she doing here? - Looking for So. Think this is a whorehouse? No one comes here. I don't want to see anyone. Dickhead. Here. I want bags of 30 with this. Bags of 10 with the rest. That's 100 dollars! It's awesome, bro. - From the Lebanese? - Yes. - OK. - Here are the bags. This too. - They're too big. - Shut up, it's all they had. Fuck, I forgot. Here. That's all? What do you mean? It's already too much. Djamal, come. We're going shopping. OK, Marteau. - When it's over, bring back the bag. - I'll send So. What are you still doing here? Move it! So, I'm going. - What about me? - Stay. - And do what? - Watch him. - Hey! - In the kitchen. You're part of the family now. - OK? - OK, you can go. 2,500 euros total, OK? No. - You're tough in business. - You bet. OK. 3,000 euros total? OK, Marteau. I'm done. One second. I'm almost done too. I just finished the last one, bro. OK, cover it up. You know, they don't search old people. Just talk to them, casually. You know? All right, go. Rach, hand me 3,000, please. - Thanks, Reda. - Sure, uncle. Say hi to the family back home. Who's taking them? Blondie. I have the tickets and passports. Great. Did you call home? My cousin will pick them up. Perfect, guys. So! So! Come on, let's go. It's too hot, I'm done. - So? - "So" what? That's how he launders the dough. The two "R"s send it back home. - The 2 what? - 2 Rs, Reda and Rachid. The 2 Rs. R and R. It's like Rolls-Royce. Rhinoceros. - It's an archaic system. - Huh? It's an archaic system. It's archaic. Be serious, man. It's anachronistic, obsolete. When a method is no longer used. Not contemporary. It's old-school, bro. It's flelleh. - Flelleh? - Yeah. You think you can do better than them? You're batshit crazy. This isn't business school. Exactly. I'm telling you, it's not school. So it's censorship! A reprobation. I'm joking. - Marteau. - Shut up! I'm joking. Hey, Reda! Guess what? So thinks our business is flelleh. Think we sell pastries? Go back to pastry school. The guy's crazy. He thinks it's a pastry school. So you think we suck? It wouldn't take much to increase your turnover. Yeah, like what? Actually, it's nothing new. It's like a McDonald's drive-thru. - "McDonald's"? - Yeah. All the cars should drive by here. Place the corner boy here to take orders, another boy to cash in there, and another to deliver. What do I get out of it? It increases productivity, enhances your brand image, customer safety, and blows away the competition. Gato! Hello. Here, this is for you. You're really beautiful. Your eyes, your lips. - I'll eat you up. - Seriously? Come on! There's a line! - How about an ice cream? - It depends where. Wherever. Come pick me up. You're here to work, not pick up girls. Chill! Did you see that? It's a women's drive-thru. - Let's make a gesture. - Huh? A commercial gesture. It's his idea. For customer loyalty. Hello. - Isn't the hash enough? - Something else. - Like what? - A lighter, paper. Why not give dollars too? In the room, two topless girls. - Licking them like a lunatic. - Bullshit. I'm not listening. It was too much. I went far, guys. I went far. Where's Gato? I'll kill him. - Why? - He stole from a customer. Everyone come look for him. Come on! Are you happy? - She didn't pay. - I don't care. You're in for it. You think I enjoy this? Huh, Gato? Think I don't have better to do? We have rules. We respect them. 1st rule: don't shit where you eat. Don't rob clients. Stay here. Hold this. Come here. Come here. Hold still. You hold him. Or I'll fuck you too. Shut up, hold him. Be still. Marteau, do your job. He's just a kid. Hey! Are you in charge here? It's family. It's Gato. Fuck up his leg. He's family. Fuck up his leg. - Marteau! - OK. - Sofiane, move. - No. Sofiane, move. Sofiane, customer safety, our brand image, huh? I know, it's important. But he gets it now. Right? Huh? - It's over? - She didn't pay. Shut the fuck up. Hey! You won't do it again? All right. He gets it now. If this goes on, how can we do business? I know. Hand the gun. Reda. The head or the leg? - Reda, please. - Keep still! Shut up! - Head? - All right. I'll do it. So. So. Make up your mind, Sofiane. So. So. So, stop! All right. Come on. Let's go. Hey, nigger! Next time won't be your leg. You bitch. Marteau! Call an ambulance. See what a bum you are? See what this leads to? Slow down. Am I going to be your prisoner long? You're not my prisoner. I'm not your prisoner? OK. Why's Marteau always tailing me? - For your safety. - My "safety"? I'm safer outside. You're out, you die. I told you to slow down. We need a business plan. What's that? It's how to have money and make more. What do we do? Here. Listen closely. There's two consumer criteria. 1st is budget. Act like you're in a supermarket. Take the cheapest. 2nd is belonging to a social group. Bohos have money. Bohos are the ones who buy our best merchandize. What do we do? Diversify our products. We adapt to their finances. And then we just keep on cashing in. The bastard's playing tough. - Drive. - What did he say? Did you know that dwarf? No. Why did he stare at you? I don't know. I don't know him. Was he the Lebanese? - You got a hard-on for him? - He's our supplier. He's the Lebanese. Reda! Which one did you pick? Come on, come on! Fuck! - We both got fucked. - Can we talk now? What is it? Did you hear about Youness? No. What is it? He took Farouk's turf. - What do I care? - Really? The guy was ready to fuck you over. We can give you their conversations. - How much? - The usual. Listen to this. Tell Marteau to have our cash ready. We're off. Staying for the next? A tip for you, Reda. Number 3. So Farouk was with Youness. Is that it? Now you see why we must finish the job? How do you know those two crooks won't talk to Youness? I don't. - Where's my son? - How do I know? Where is my son, Rachid? I don't know. Don't lie to me. Talk to me. I know you. Tell me where he is. I don't know. He's a big boy. He's an adult, isn't he? No one will take him from me. We'll find him. No one will take him. Think I'm scared of you? I don't give a shit about you. Look at this place. - Here he is. - Where were you? Stop it, enough! Where were you? Slim's killers are still out. They'll find me if I come home. That's why I'm safer with him. The women here are sick of this. Enough. Look, trust me, mom. I'll be home soon. Come home. Calm down, now. Please come home. Mom. Hey! Look at all the girlies. Aren't they pretty? I've been waiting for an hour. Where's Reda? What's he doing? - Doesn't he trust us? - Ask him. The weed has made you all paranoid. - Reda doesn't smoke. - Whatever. Anyway. What do you want? How much is it? How much is what? For the last caller's identity. I can't guarantee it. How much? 5,000. Half now, half later. "Later" when? The new security measures have become a problem. But don't worry, I'll find a way. - Keep it quiet. - As long as you pay. - Here. - Are you crazy? - What? - In the bag, discreetly. - All right? - OK. Thanks. - Bye, then. - Yeah, bye! What a lunatic. He's wacko! I don't think you understand. You'll lower the hash by 20 % and the commercial by 50 %. - Non negotiable. - Non negotiable? I don't understand that expression. Do you want me to explain? You make business thanks to me. You're getting richer, I'm happy for you. But like they say: SahtÃ¨ne a albak. Now listen. Here's my offer. I drop the supply by 50 %. The price stays the same. For commercial and special. What? You want to punish me? No! Why? It's business, Reda. I'm not so bold. And you said it was non negotiable. Reda, don't make the mistake of thinking you can do without me. Sir! Sir! I'm coming. I'm coming. Gentlemen. That's what I call class. Sucker! "It's non negotiable. "But like they say: 'hascblek sasbleck.'" I've been calling you. You don't answer. What do you want? Is it Marteau? Didn't you see he was high? - Don't do this. - Do what? You do what you want, and tell me not to do this? - Najette. Hey! Najette! - What? I asked you to give me some time, and you're taking it like... We're together. What are you saying? "Time"? You don't need time. - Stop it. - You're just like them. Like your brother. Don't talk that way. It hurts me. You think you never hurt me? Huh? I want to be with you. I don't want your shitty life, Sofiane. I don't want you to call me or to come by. I don't want to hear from you. You get it? You and I are through. - Stop it. - Leave me alone. Why are you clenching my arm? Youness, you're done. There's still one to go. Tonight is shrimp night, courtesy of Youness! Come on, Reda. Into my ear. He won't put it in. Forget it, Reda. I'm too strong. Nothing for you tonight. Come on, show us. - This one's going in. - Ready? My partner isn't in good shape today. Come on, show us what you've got. - What do you say now? - Pay! - That's luck for you. - What "luck"? How much? 200? Hand it over. So? How about a game at 500? - Get the balls ready. - It's done. - We're fucking for free tonight. - You're staying with me. What do you want? What's he doing here? Hey! You stick to the theory. I do the practical work. OK? I know what I'm doing. What's up? The Lebanese is smuggling stuff in. - My friend is on it. - Who is this friend? He works for the Lebanese. It's a sure thing. That dwarf we saw? The one you swore you didn't know? Him? - What do you want? - Why are you staring at me? - You want to fuck the Lebanese? - Yeah. You want to fuck him? Why should we blow him forever? Now's the time, Reda. We have everything. It's now or never. All right. We'll see. Still think business school sucks? Looking for trouble? I'll tell you, man. You're huge. Just huge. It's just too much. I feel so good right now. Just blow him. You know he's huge. Shut up, go work. You're jealous. He's huge! I'll show you "jealous"! - It's a non-stop service. - What? I mean there's halla customers. Where are you going? Marteau! Are you OK? Are you hurt? Blondie. Blondie! Blondie! Blondie! Blondie! Hey, Blondie! Get an ambulance. Did someone call an ambulance? Blondie? Blondie? - Hey! - Is he breathing? Hey, cuz! Sofiane. You know Youness wasn't trying to kill Blondie. What's going on? Sofiane. It's now or never. Later will be too late. Come on. You steer the job. No, no. He won't steer shit. You're doing the job. You know why? Because you're next on Youness's list. You know that? Do whatever you like. I don't give a shit. Either you act like a bitch all your life, or you get revenge for your brother. Hey! What are you doing? Climb on. I knew you didn't have the balls to do it. This stays between the two of us. Reda, are you sure about the Lebanese? Why? Aren't you? It'll be hard if we hit him. - He won't back down. - Don't worry. We're going at war. I'm ready for war. Shut up! You're still high! How about you, So? Ready? He's a soldier. Man, if we do this job, we need someone to supply us straight away. It's all planned out. We'll sell through the three corners. We're going to make a lot of dough. Selling is fine. But we have to be ready: have weapons, soldiers. Actually, I made a decision. Sofiane will handle the three corners. Don't worry, Marteau. Nothing against you. Are you kidding, Reda? Does it look like I'm kidding? Why? What did I do wrong? Nothing at all. We're like a ball team. Every player has a position. It's how we win. What ball team? You'll have your position. What position? What's his position? - What is it? - I didn't know. I get why you were blowing him. Sofiane! Sofiane, sit down. - Got nothing to say? - I didn't know about it. - I trust Reda. - Want me to tear you up? Go fuck yourself! Eat shit! You bitch! You don't have any balls. - Bitch! - Come on. Hey! - Is something unclear? - It's clear. It's all about you, here. - You're disrespectful. - Oh? So what? - You'll get rid of me? - Get out now. I'm going. Mr.-Know-it-all here went to school. You don't know shit. - Think about it. - Marteau, stop. What's your game, Reda? What's wrong with you? I won't let him handle shit. He never fucked with you. You don't get it. He only likes action. The guy's a loose canon. Don't worry. I need more guys like you. The serious, business type. Reda, Marteau's a savage, I know. But he's family. I won't do anything to him. What would you do, in Marteau's shoes? Huh? I'd leave Marseille. It's the only place he knows. He never left the hood. Do you know what I would do? I'd go and see the Lebanese. Tell him everything, to fuck us over. Yes. But Marteau isn't you. You know what? Call him. Tell him we're at war and you want out. No. He knows you, Reda. You think he's stupid? He'll be suspicious. Tell him you know how to leave Marseille. He'll follow. Where? In a cafe? A McDonald's? Downtown? Wherever. Someplace that's your own. And then? "And then"? Then, if you care for him, make sure he stays away, while we take care of the Lebanese. What is it? Don't you trust me? Do you think I'm behind Reda? Do you think I control him? No, Marteau! I didn't know anything about it. I'd never have done that, you know. With your temper, you didn't even let me explain. Fuck! We haven't come here for at least ten years! What's your plan? My mom's cousin is in Paris. Stay there. Just for a week, maybe two, the time we find a solution, and things settle down. It's not looking good for you, Marteau. All right? So. I have to tell you. What did you want? Huh? For him to go tell the Lebanese? Come on, move it! Move it, I said! Where are you? Come on, drive. Drive. What did I say? Mom, Sofiane is here. Hey! Where are you going? Huh? What is this? Enough! Listen, it's enough! You stay here, now. Chouf. Look at me. Sofiane, stay! Listen to me. What are you doing here? Answer me. What are you doing here? Listen, So. If something happens to dad, you're dead to me. Leila! Wait for me. Right. As you can imagine, the call was located a hundred meters from your home. I found the number of the SIM card on the last call. It was bought in a bar on the Vieux-Port. I have some pictures, but you won't go far. Here. The quality sucks, I know. It was nice doing business with you. - Hello. - Hey. - Is Gato home? - Yes. - In his room. - Here? What's up? - Hey, what's up? - Hey. - What? - Nothing to say? - Nothing to say? - What? - Get up! - So! Fuck! Put that away. You gave the go-ahead to kill my brother? - It wasn't me. - Did you do it? - It wasn't me. - It's you. Look. It's you. - Who's on those pictures? - It's me. Who were the cards for? Who were they for? - For the business. - Gato! Who were the cards for? For the guys. - Who gave the go-ahead? - It wasn't me. I'm going to kill you. Talk to me. I'm going to fuck you up. Tell me. Why did you do it, Gato? Who were they for? For the business. For Slim, Marteau. And Reda. - Which one? - I forgot, So. Which one? Which one? I forgot. If you talk you're dead. Get it? Get it? Stop it, So. Back off. Go back to your room. An alleged new scandal in the Marseille police. Members of the prestigious BAC, the anti-crime squad, are suspected of receiving bribes and reselling stolen drugs. Isabelle Sasquet, Christophe Laroca. - Who is it? - Me, So. - Who is it? - It's Sofiane. - Are you alone? - Yes! - All right. - Come in. - Huh? - Come. - What is it? - Look. They are in daily contact with dealers selling drugs, or cigarettes. While on the job they extorted money and narcotics from the dealers: a long-standing practice in the police department. Some are known to take a share of the spoils. - Did you see how I fucked them? - Impressive. Hey, bro. How do you do it? It's all in the rumors, Sofiane. The rumors! I saw my friend. The job is off. What did I tell you? Huh? I knew Marteau would talk. It's not him. Who is it, then? The Lebanese couldn't find transportation. So? Turns out now he found someone. Listen here. Several tons of bamboo, 150 kilos of coke, who knows how many tabs hidden in the truck. A dream come true! - What do we do? - When is it? Tomorrow night. Are you interested? Reda, you can't let an opportunity like that pass you by. Bring you friend to the snack bar. The drivers? No. No one knows what's in the truck. - You know when and where? - What's the deal? - How do you know all this? - It's my job. What's your friend's name, Sofiane? - His name is Kevin. - Kevin. Who wants ice cream? - Ice cream, Kevin? - No. Let's talk. Come on, let's talk. What is it? - Sofiane! Sofiane! - Rachid! - No! - Lie down! Lie down! - What's going on? - Lie down. What's going on? How do you think he'll last, at minus 30 degrees? Hey! What do you want, Reda? What about the plan? - Are you scared for him? - Whatever. How does he know this? - Why? - Answer me! Through a dancer at the Lebanese's cabaret. She's hot on him. She told him. The dwarf's fucking his whore? - The dwarf is fucking her. - Do I look dumb? She heard him on the phone, went through his stuff. And then she just told him? You believe this? I don't know. Three tons of bamboo, 150 kilos of coke, thousands of tabs. A dwarf. - Can't make it up. - Open up! Reda, the Lebanese is hot on her. She knows everything. - You're scared for him. - I'm not. Kill him, for all I care. Go ahead, let him die. Without him, the plan's dead. Sofiane, Sofiane. Try to understand. I want to know what I'm getting into. Reda, what do I see? 4 million dollars waiting in a truck. And we're here. Open up! Didn't you say we wouldn't stick to weed like all the other bums? That we were climbing straight to the top? You decide. See what you prefer. OK, Rach. Let him go. - Sofiane. - Get up. - Don't speak. - OK. It's not right, what you did to him. Why did you do that? Yeah? Perfect. Drive. He's coming. Stop, stop! Stop! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door, I said! Look ahead. Drive. Hands behind your back. Don't move! Get down! Get down, I said. Shut up. - What's wrong with you? - Shut up. - Hands! - Seriously? Come here, you. Move it. - Behind your back. - Are you serious? - What's up, So? - Shut up! What's wrong with you? OK, go on. Keep your eyes on him. Show me your hands. I told you not to move. Take that off. Shut up. Easier than I thought. What do you want? - Guess. - Want to eat alone? It's money, bro. For the dough? What about Slim? He was your associate until Reda was released. He was a brother to me. - What did you say? - He was a brother to me. Shut up! Shut it, motherfucker! - Why did you kill him? - I didn't. - Why did you? - It wasn't me. Who was it? Who was it? - Who? - Farouk. Farouk? Sure! Bastard. Rachid, you have one last chance. Don't blow it. Who was it? Rachid! Marteau was driving when you killed Slim. It's why you killed him. You know I had to. Shut your mouth. You disgust me. Go on, shoot. Kill me. Don't delude yourself. We're both alike. What do you know? Come on! Let's go. Where are you going? Sofiane. Where are you going? Yeah! You don't have the balls. Hey! Hey! Shut up. What's up, Kevin? They're inside. Girls, are you ready? Come on. Let's go. - Here. - What? - Cookies for the trip. - Thanks. Thanks. Let's go. - See you. - Wait. - Where are you going? - With you. - Come on, Ines. - She's not coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. - Let's go. - Bye, mom. - Don't worry. - Bye, baby. Mom, I'm not going to America. It's my son. - Careful. - Yes. Bye, darling. Have a good trip. - The good life. - "The good life?" Wait till you see what it's like. And what about school? We'll make it work. Wait, there's Gato. Let me say goodbye. Go ahead. Gato. Bye. See you next year. Yeah, sure thing. Subtitles: ECLAIR
