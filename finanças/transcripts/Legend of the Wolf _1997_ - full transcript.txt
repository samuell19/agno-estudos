It was built when my grand father was still the General Isn't it the Seven Saint Temple? Yes, it's because of war A statue was put here People came to get the gold on its body, so it's broken Many people came here to worship The Great General Li Lin-Ying... No, Li was an eunuch! Anyways, whatever Li You know in time of war, it's all a mess Not even a utensil for burning incense Hero, why do you come here? Don't go! Run! It's shit if you are caught Kid, how dare you steal?

I haven't know a friend who lost memory, it's great! Do you remember how you lost your memory? I remember I was a soldier, I was shot Damn Japanese! I almost lost my memory by Japanese's bullet too! I don't mind telling you I am a orphan But I am lucky to be loved by the villagers Of course, I did many things that win their hearts Now, I have finally grown up... Damn Japanese! You lost your memory, but I don't I remember I haven't eaten enough I remember that I want to wait for a woman Woman? What is she? You don't remember her name, do you? It's difficult to help! What characteristics does she have? She is so nice! These mosquitoes must be reincarnated by Japanese! My blood is almost dried out Well... So dark and wet! What kind of temple is it? It's hot in day time, and there are so many mosquitoes at night! But I can't go back to the village! And I was attacked by different gangs in a day! Even small kids wanted to kill me What an ill-fated day! If you come in without noise again, I Will kill you I thought you belong to the gang in the forest I am sorry to scare you! In fact, this is not your fault I sneaked in, people would afraid of course Especially after the great war this afternoon They are not bandits, better be careful I think so, it's impossible for so many bandits to come for me Most probably, they came for you Your sword is so great, you won't give it a damn, right? If you think you wronged me Why don't you teach me sword stance? Not only for me I can help in time of emergency Won't you say no? What do you want to learn? Sword! It'll be quicker to learn playing sword People said, the training takes a hundred days only It'll be quick And, you just need to sharpen one side But, do you have any... Any shorter course? Do you know the use of sword? For chopping, for cutting... For killing too I know all these A sword is used to separate things I just want to learn simple but powerful sword stance Don't just stare at me, speak up now Simple? How can sword stance be powerful but simple? Well, you can teach me some simple but powerful stance Have you heard of 3 open, 3 secret & 3 cunning stances of sword? Among three cunning stances, they are divided into true and fake And there are three covered stances, among it... That's too complicated for me, any less complicated stance? Well, better be quick stance Hold the sword Your sword is so sharp, you can't fool me It cut the wood instead, you didn't use it at all It's just warm up Now, you did chop it But you didn't chop with your heart I used my heart I used my lungs too If you don't want to teach me, just forget it You'd better save that crap Why don't you say "I am the sword, the sword is me"? That's the point I want to learn sword stance from you It is just for chopping wood What kind of sword you were using in the forest? That's the sword for killing I just want that A killing sword is not just using it for killing It depends on the will to kill When you have a mind to kill It's not necessary for you to have a sword in hand or not Killing doesn't depend on the sword It's the man! Take the sword You can say in this way, it depends on your heart It doesn't mind if you have a sword or not If you have a heart to chop wood... Whatever you are, whatever sword you are using Be frank, do you have any inner stance? If yes, pass some to me, then I won't bother you Numerous illusions, learning truth from fakes Learning truth from fake? I don't buy such theory It's out-dated When you use sword, make sure it's sharp, quick and tough Fastest speed Toughest heart Aim the target, and hit once This is same as life According to this idea, plus an aggressive heart Whether you can be on top of others or not, you'll decide it Not from God Fake or true, win or lose It's very simple Many people can't see it, but they don't want to face it So they just explain it with lousy explanations Just believe those most complicated and difficult theories In fact, fake or true, win or lose There is no difference either you gain or not The airport is going to be moved I remember I had nothing when I came here People lived very happily Now, there are new airport and new bridge They gain everything they want People do not live happily instead Things get old, then they will be replaced If there is nothing new, how can they have progress? New things will get old soon What can I help you, Ben? I want to kill one person Will you get what you want after his death? Yes Which way do you want to kill? My way? Use my WEN- Well, I will tell you a story as reference Although this is nothing to do with you Pay attention please I believe that it would solve your problem his sword, if you take it, you will think it useless at all But, if he gets it, it will be so useful... Shut up! I gave him half chicken to flatter him! What's up? By the way, once he gets is, he can kill anything This is an invincible sword You won't understand Shut up! You are useless! You just shut up when you face problem When troubles are over you become big mouth again! Don't you know we are going to starve soon? You are inhumane! How can you ask the old to go? We go together No! If you don't go... I can't go, do you understand? Why not? You are seeking excuse He is invincible, do you understand? If you don't go Just share the money among us Right, share the money! He is so powerful! Alright, we will go ourselves, you, stay behind We are not afraid of him Even four of you are no match for him It'll be a piece of cake for him to beat you down With so many of us, you think we can't beat him? I won't believe such shit! Let's go, don't give it a damn! Are you 90mg? Of course! There are so many people, we need not give it a damn! I've said, I would beat him to death! What a fast match?

You have grown up together, I think you fall deeply for each other Yes, Man-hin loves me very much His family treated me nice too I was poor When his grandma sewed new clothes, he'd ask her to make me one At that time, we always wore same clothes We were always teased to be little couple His grandma died Man-hin then made clothes for us And he came to my house to do domestic work for me After the death of my dad He came to do the farming for me My mom treated him as her son-in-law since then I heard that Brother Fung was once a soldier Can a soldier make big money? Of course A soldier's life is so hard, he has to clean and to cook Is that right? Auntie San, a soldier has to kill many people Big mouth, they only kill bastards, is that right? Brother Fung killed many Japanese You are young and pretty, the Japanese would rape you if they saw you 10 years ago Damn you big mouth! It's not necessary to make big money But, we should learn from Man-hin, he is heroic In these years, he always sends me money and letters And than asked me to help the villagers He said, after the war, good days will not far That's why you are that single minded to wait for his return It's useless, he is back now, but he remembers nothing What's wrong with you? Just cut the crap Eat your rice! I wanna beat you to death! Stop eating! Shut up! Just come back Don't push me Thank you Tell me, what was I like? When the war started, you were recruited to the army We agreed that After the war, no matter what, provided that we were not dead We have to wait for each other in the temple Until we meet again!
