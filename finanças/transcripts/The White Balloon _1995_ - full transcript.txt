C.M.I Present: White Balloon Writing credits Abbas Kiarostami Directed by Jafar Panahi Produced by Kurosh Mazkouri Dear audience! I hope you have a good day! Time is seven passed five, After another one hour 20 minutes... ... and 30 seconds the New Year will be arrived. This mister must made a mistake. That's right, he is talking nonsense. -Can I ask a question? -Certainly. Can I pull those stings out from his body? He doesn't has any sting, my friend. He is neither a vespid nor a scorpion. Doesn't snake has any stings? No, he only got fangs. Right, fangs. Now they all understand... ... that Snake's teeth are poisonous. Plus understood all snakes are poisonous. Thus, please allow me... ... to recite a poem to everybody. When I caught a snake with horns, I can show every one its horns, come on. However, a snake's horns are distinct from the rest animals' horns. Distinct from deers'. Distinct from goats'. Like two grains of rice, located on each side of the head, Those are the snake's horns. Mama, let me go to buy it, I will be right back. I've said, no! Don't close... ... it's too late now. Where are you going? Get papa some soaps. Please! Let me go to buy it. I've said, No! You see within the pond... where to get it? It's always about they bought for us, but not this year. Looks exactly the same as those fish sold in the market. I will be right back. I promise I will not lose myself. I have seen that, too. Not the same. Our fish are thinner. What did you say? There is no more shampoo left. I am not talking to you. Alright, they are different. Our fish are way thinner. Thin? Don't you make a mistake here? Their gills look like are dancing when they are swinging. Their gills are so long, there are four of them. OK, I still have many things need to do. Keep this basket well, and bring me a basin. But there are only three left. And if isn't because I have some emergency, none of them will be left. We have got none left during the New Year's day. And during grandma's visit. Can't we celebrate the new year without fish? Don't you just sitting there, come and grab a fish. Bring that red over here. And the fish bowl, too. Hurry, go. Mama, just let me go, please! I can trade in all of my gifts for this. You haven't received any gifts yet. Grandma will send me gifts. I give all of them to you. And you already put on new clothes before the new Year's arrival. Pledged hand those gifts out even before you have received them. What's the matter? Nothing. Kids are headstrong, you gotta hurry. If your late are caused by mum... then that will be my fault. Don't cry in New Year's eve. Can't shed tears to catch fish in New Year's day, either. Bring that red one. Wash it up, hurry. Daddy, daddy! What's the matter, I have brought it. Good. Put into the basket. And those fruits beside the tap. The bag is broken. Crying again. Crying again. She doesn't want to pay for the fish. You don't like our own's? You didn't see the others. When their gills were swinging, they were like dancing. They've got so many gills, how much? -100. -100? You are willing to spend 100 Tomans to buy a fish!? Those are couple of movies' money! Out of your mind. I need shampoo, and you bring me soap. You're never paying much attention. Once again, you... ... make her upset. Go to do whatever you want to do. You think I need you to... You gave me soup, not shampoo! His voice was resounding... ... and lost since then. Pick the soap out of the water, and dry it. Sarah. You want egg shampoo? Yeah, egg shampoo. All right, hurry. Uh... bring you the shampoo, right. You are still carrying on... Are you going to complain? -How are you, Lisa? -Very well, thanks. Is your mum doing OK? She let me bought a fish. for decoration. Let's see if Rice knows.

I will pass on this hat, hope you all can act generously. Let god watch the rest. We will witness how do you lead a hand... ... to these Devil Snakes. This is... ... the first one. and inside the box, there is another one weights 4 kilogramme. Perhaps gentlemen believe we aren't going to display it.

Come and get it, little angel. -My dear Devil Snake kings... -What? What should we do with this little girl? What's wrong? Doesn't let us find a chance to hand her... back her money. If we don't act quickly... snake will be awaken. ... and no longer able to return the money. Have you heard what Devil Snake king just said? I wasn't said to you. this snake. a quite shameless.

Allow me to pick up and give her back. -Are you sure? -Positive. -You won't regret? -No regrets. You are so stubborn. Don't move. Hurry baby, come to see the snake. She brought it out. You want to put from a top? Who dare to approach? All back off. It will bite. Don't you persist. Gentlemen, pay your attention... Come to check whether... the snake let anyone take away the money. Do I look like a liar? A weather-beaten old man like me? You people hold on for a second. Come and check whether I am the one lying. -What are you going to do now? -Refund! You people always refuse to listen to me. What about our supper? Where is the money for the food? That explains the way of your pockets are always remain empty. Do you want to keep her money? Can't you see she is crying? It's not her money, it's her mum's. You got small child here. Snake likes your money. You see, it won't let it go. Unless it couldn't see the money. I am not lying to you. Little angel, tell me the truth. Are you afraid of snake? It doesn't has teeth. For take care of my family... ... I will only let you see. Not even has one tooth.

I give you back the money. Very good. Here is your money. Now you go. May God bless you. Hi. Looks like you need something. A goldfish. -Which one? -Among these. A white one. With lots of gills. -Want a big one? -Yeah. 200. It was said 100 before. Not all with that price. Those small ones, 100. The big ones, 200. But just give me this handsome small one. Only 100. Welcome, Ma'am. What are you look for? Come in please. Just like at your own home. OK, did you bring any money? Let me take a look. Can you sell me the big one for 100 Tomans? I can't, big one costs 200 Tomans. How many do you need? Let me see. Here are yours. Come on, pick it up. What have you done to it? In your pocket, check where did you put it into? I lost my 500 Tomans. Where? I stuffed it into the fish bowl. -Then who took it? -I am clueless. What's wrong? What do you need? I carried 10 Tomans here before, now here is 5 Tomans, together are 15. -How much did i give you? -200. -How much do you need? -250 Hold it tight, kid. Yours. Now, you let it go. Not only struggling on work, and now... ... this little girl is weeping. -How much you got? -500 Tomans. A one 500 Tomans' note, right? -Yes. -What do you want to buy? A fish. What kind of fish? Like those in the fish bowl. But they aren't worth 500 Tomans. Maybe you should get a big one. No. But not those. Extremely costly. -You sure? -Yeah. -Can you recognise a 500 Tomans bill? -I can. -What colour? -Red. Like this one? No. Not this one. It's not this one. Not this one. No, it is a red one. Red. -You sure? -Yes. Just like this? -Yeah, that's it. -No, it's mine. This is my money. You never gave me one bill that worth 500 Tomans. My god, they passed you a bill worth 500 Tomans to come get some fish. Look at the load of troubles you stuck into. You make me forgot the time. Don't cry. Go all the way back where you came and search from there. Ma'am, what do you need? Go back to search. Stop crying now! There is no way she can find back her money. She has done it. Nobody would pay much attention on the floor... ... even golds are spread of everywhere. Come, Wipe off those tears. Go back to places you came from, it might can be found. What's wrong, darling? Why are you weeping? I was going to buy a fish, but then I lost the money. -I will buy you one. -No. Where did you lost it? Where did come from? Track down those original roads, it will be found. No more crying. Let's go. You still here. Still haven't found your money? Nothing. Poor child. What a pity. Where do you live? -Go straight from here. -I will go with you. Can you pick up the memory and try to remember the place you lost the money? Did you pass here? Passed through that snake-master? Where is your fish bowl? Why don't you bring it with you? -I left it in the store. -What for? Until I get that fish... I don't want that fish bowl. I have to stop at here. Here? Why do you come to here? You are not suppose to be at here. This is not a place you ought to come. Have you seen... ... a little girl like yourself? Me. ... Or some woman like me stick here alone. Haven't your parents ever told you should never come to here? Every time when we were passing here... ... I told my parents I wanted to watch for a little while. but they just won't allowed. One time, before school... ... I saw a man was watching... ... and holding his daughter onto his shoulders. I wanted my daddy do the exactly same thing... ... but he said this is not a place small children suppose to come. Turned a half circle. He kept telling me passed by here today. I saw my mum was walking in front, then I quit to pay much attention after then. I told you this is not a place you ought to be in. Must realise this is doing no good to you. Never ever let me notice. Now you know why this is doing no good to you? I think so. And will you come back again? No, but there are always those snake-masters. Really? You forgot your words. When was the last time you saw that money? When I passed it to Devil Snake king. You gave him the money. You firmly sure that he gave it back to you afterwards. Yeah, but then he left. then there was another one, that one with silver hairs gave me back. When was the last time you saw him? in Bakery. The one at the street's corner. I stopped by, staring at the shop window. I was checking on those cream bread. I put my eyes on my fish bowl before I left. Here is the bakery I am talking about. Where did you stopped by? Come. I will show you. It's here. No money at here. I am positive this is the site. You come, we carefully go through here together now. What if it couldn't be found? I will go tell your mother. It's not your fault. Then whose fault is it going to be? It is your fault. But order to not ignite her fury... I will describe the whole thing as this way. My money. Baby, I am exhausted. Let's sit down for a while. -Let's go find Mr.Ali. -My money. You just found it. Let's find the shopkeeper. Before she comes back home... for the New Year's Day. We have told you your money will come back. Now you can go buy those fish. Let's go. Go. Say hello to your father. -Hello, Mr. Ali. -Good morning. Nice to meet you. Do us a favour? This little girl's money dropped into the sewer. Could you help to go and get it? it dropped through the sideline. Very well. Come, you don't need to cry. You have already found your money. Now you can go and buy your fish. OK, I have to go now. Good-bye. Happy New Year! Same to you. Good-bye. -Have you finished that shirt? -I am still working on one sleeve. Use this first, clients are on their ways. They are coming soon. Will complain again. Pick this up, too. Hurry up. What's the matter? Collar is too wide. Then this is it. Every styles are the same. I don't want it. Here is another customer's requirements, I wrote them down. I am strictly based on the requirements to do the work. Collar is certainly too wide. I never do this. But it is not my fault. It is what you asked for. Don't you be angry, I just want it be modified a tiny bit. You see, my face is small. Even the the shirt I am wearing... ... is the one with a small collar. I can't modify this collar, you should just wear it the way it is. Don't waste anymore times. Today is New Year's day. Plus I got tons of things to do. Why must you... ... been so harsh? -Not suppose to be so stubborn like this. -No, I am not. I finished my works. If you don't like to wear this shirt on, that's your own business. Son, what do you want? What do you want? My money dropped down there! And the store is closed, too. Stay aside. Originally, I wanted to buy a fish. My mum, handed me money for the fish. If you can't help me get it now. Then next week. Dear friend. Haven't you understand? It' impossible to do so. Your collar, your face or your head, all have got nothing to do with me. Just quit telling me whether your head size is too big or too small... Why don't you clean a bit? This is not my job, and I don't take care of heads. Not my problem. I am just doing my work. Grab the remaining materials. Not interesting, either. It's not my fault, the real problem is on... ... your own body. It's almost been half an hour. Here, saw this wood stick to smaller pieces. Can't do the same to fix the collar. No need further explanations. -How much for the fish? -100 Tomans. I will find my money. Oh, you are back. I just said you can find it. No worry. Where is it? I didn't bring any money, it dropped into a sewer. I will try to grab it out. But the shopkeeper is quarrelling... ... with another man. All I can do now is come and check whether my fish is still here or not. I go back to get money. My fish won't be sold, right? Relax. You must guarantee that you will come back to here buy the one you selected, though. That one, the white one. With his girlfriend now. He is indeed a handsome one. I want that one. But this handsome is going to cost 200 Tomans. My mama told me, it only worth 100 Tomans. Alright, that's OK. Take it. Just remember come back and pay. As 100 Tomans. -Deal? -No, I don't want it now. Just take it. No, it's OK as long as you promise me that it won't be sold I promise to you. I will put it into the guard until you come back. Where is your fish bowl? Hand it to me. By the time you are talking to that lady, I leave it at here. -I can't see it. -Of course it can be seen. -You sure? -Sure. Muhammad. This little girl said she left a fish bowl in the store. Get one. Fill it up. At here. -Where are you going? -To get some water. Be right back. This is your fish. Quite pretty, rounded one. But this one is so thin. I want a larger one. You check out from a top. It would be always looks thin from there. Now it's better. You see how big it is? You should observe this way all the time. Little chubby. Precious little thing. Hold it tight. Let me get money first. You can pay the money later. I refuse. I will be right back. Where have you gone? What's with your face? Not your business. Where are the fish bowl or money? I lost the money. You lost the money. -Yes. -Be more specific. I lost it at the beginning, then found it again. Now where is the money? You fool, there is no way we can get that money out. What are we going to do? Must try. How so? Whose store is over there? Owner is the one beside the tree. Which one? The one who is leaning on it. He is the one just quarrelled. I couldn't stand with a teenager. He keeps telling me how small his head is. How big his collar is and how unsuitable that is. What am I got to do with that? Calm down. Have some water. Here. Have a cigarette. He has a similar age with your son. Rather not to do so... Maybe you should help him fix a bit. Not my fault to let him has a small head. He can adjust by himself. He asked for all of these. Two years ago, I made an exactly same one, too. Last year he was with the army... he could have stayed there... no white but not very tidy, either. Please, you have to make the shirt like this! Please, you have to make the shirt like this! Needless to remember who you were. Where were you from. It's unnecessary. Something that shouldn't occurred from the first place occurred. I dumped my anxiety. but I didn't feel proud for myself, either. Mister, my money. You are still here? We should go now. Mr.Ali I feel really sorry for this trouble. Good-bye. Where are you going? Don't you leave here yet. -You have done with the blue T-shirt? -Yes. -The store next to this one is yours, too? -No, others. Can I go now? All solved. -You have finished everything? -Yes. -Where are you going? -Go back to my hometown. Don't forget bring me back gifts. Can I have my money back? Here you have some candies and two T-shirts. Happy New Year. Come back within a week, don't you forget that. If there is no other things I want to go out. I will be back until one. OK, but don't go too long. We still have plenty of workload. I will come back on time. -Bye Now. -See you. -What can get you? -My money. This is not my store. Shopkeeper went for a trip. Come get your money after the New Year. It's the next door. The girl marked it. -She is my sister. -What do you want me to do? -Can't you get the money out? -I am not the shopkeeper. -Is Hussein in Teheran? -No way. The one you know. he left this city. His wife always obeys him. I am pretty sure he has left. But don't you worry. Your money. Now you go home. Come back pick up the money in next week. You have to understand... Forget it, what am I going to do? -What do you crave most? -My money. I don't have keys for the store. Come back in next week. Mr. Ali... I have to go serve customers now. You will recognise in somewhere, something is not right. All right, if you still insist on. Thanks for your help. See you later. -What do we ought to do? -No idea. How am I suppose to know? Store is closed. Shopkeeper went for a trip. You people come back in the next week. You people just leave. Technically, only got 42 minutes... ... 20 seconds... ... New Year will be arrived. Surfs are getting stronger, brother. Such powerful waves! How am I going to take it out? Kid, what do you need? -My money is inside there! -I can't help you. -Can it be left here? -What? This is for dredge the lock. But why? Just a minute. OK, but better hurry up, I have to go. Try from the fence. What are you doing? I don't even know. You will never reach there like this! Give it to me, let me try. There is no way. This is for dredge the lock, not for stuff like this. Only if we can twist it like that... -Can it be done like that? -Impossible. It surely can't. Not suited for this. You come back within a week. The money will always be there. Couple of more days will be his decease's one year anniversary, isn't it? Right. But I still can't go yet I will go after tomorrow. -Isn't it too late? -No, time is just right. Let's go, children. You people don't stick around here anymore. It will cause attention. I will get busy once the holiday is over. I will go to find the shopkeeper. Money won't be lost. No one can take it out. Your parents will be anxious. We ought to ask for an address. What kind of address? Shopkeeper's. You just wait, I will be right back. What's the matter? It's one of his relative who doesn't know he has gone. Wait up. I want to ask you something. M um knows. Something happened? Quiet! You keep talking to me will drive me forget the address. I am going. I didn't see any notes at all. the 500 Tomans' one. that's just what I worried. Here, take some melon seeds. Let's see whether I can give you a hand. Grab some. Don't want any. If you dislike eating seeds, I got candies, too. I opened the box. Looks like you don't want eat candies, either. Why are you so worried? I am not going to eat you alive. I am not going to eat your alive, either. Why need to be so scared? I saw you stopped. I thought you might need some helps. Don't be afraid, I am a nice man. If you decide not to reply on my words, then I got nothing else to say. But... I know where is the shopkeeper. He is living on the street that your brother is going to. But he isn't going to not visit that shopkeeper, you know why? Because the shopkeeper is not at home. My wife's sister invited him to go there and have fun. Your wife's sister? If he wasn't there yet, then he must be on his way now. Hard to say, because... My wife's sister lives 800 miles away from here. You know... My own sister is similar as your age now. You almost turned 5, right? Where did you get that? I am 7 already! My sister is five. Similar as you, but haven't been to school yet. You were wrong again, I am 7, already prepared to go to school I just started... My grades are remarkable. Now what are you going to talk to me? My another sister has entered grade 3. She has remarkable grades, too. Although hasn't joined school yet, looks like you are elder than most of those 5s. What? What do you want to say? My two sisters... One is younger than you: another is elder than you. I... really miss them. If you miss them this much, why don't just go back? They live far far away. Where? In?????? You are?????? One of my dad's friends is from there, too. But he rarely speaks. Just like you. Left too long. will lose that accent. If I can stay here little bit of longer... Me too. -How long have been in Teheran? -A year. When will you leave? When I am retiring from the army... or during the vacation. Don't you have holiday during New Year's period? Even schools are closed. My dad is not working, either. Everybody is resting. Nobody go to work. We have holiday, too. However, I've decided to stay. I will stay. You are lying to me about those of your sister's things No, I don't... You get angry again. I am not lying to you. I want to see them. You want to go back home to see them? Of course. Then go back home now, if that is what you want. I got dilemma. Are you on holiday? Equals to... you skip classes. I mean, you... I am working in a barrack. Then, why no holiday? Tell me, how many those days are... ... still remaining... Like your father, we have a whole week. Seriously, what does your father do? I don't know. You don't know or you just don't want to let me know? It should the don't want to let you know one. It's up to you, but if I answered your questions, then you need to confess since you are missing them so much... ... why not to go back home and take a look? If you are currently on holiday... Why don't you just leave? -You want to know why? -Yeah... And then you will tell me what is your dad's occupation. He got two jobs. I tell you one, and keep another to myself. My mama used to tell me do not chat these with other people. His first job is in a water supply company. went to work by riding a motorcycle. and read those materials. Now you heard... ... the job's description. But I don't want to tell you his second job. Likewise. I have two reasons. I will only tell you the first one, just like you. First of all it's because I got insufficient money... ... to take a bus. and then there is... I got to purchase some gifts... ... for my two sisters. ... and my parents. I love bring gifts to them. Therefore, I can't leave. I want to find a job after retired from the army... ... before go back to home. Do you know... ... How much to take the bus? Will be a discount price for soldiers. 300 Tomans... What kind of gifts do you want to buy for your sisters? I don't know what did you get. Good ideas? You could bring them a pack of gum. or several chocolate bars. No, chocolates aren't good. Wait a minute, let me see if there are other better ideas... Just try these. Girls are mostly shy. Each sold for 7 Tomans. If you buy double, that will be 14 Tomans. Go a head. 400 Tomans. enough? Yeah, 400 Tomans is fine. Let me give you more. No. This money is for my mum's New Year time's use. The New Year, I almost forgot. This money is for buying gifts, too. Now you have provided brilliant ideas. Get these candies, I help you get cash. Why don't take them? Family members used to tell you don't accept anything from any strangers. that's right. Neither allow you talk to strangers. Correct. that's why you were reluctant to chat with me at the very beginning, am I right? Right. I really don't know you. But I am not a bad person. If you don't know men, then you are. I am serving the army at here. Don't know anyone. Others don't know me. that's why I am a stranger. But the truth is not like that. What do you mean? By the first time I saw you... ... I felt we already known each other. that's why I approached and tried to start a conversation with you. I feel I am like you big brother. For you, I am not a stranger at all. But you are not belong to my sister's age group, For me, that makes you become to a stranger again. Family members used to tell me don't accept anything from any strangers. Neither allow me talk to them. Should I say the same things to my sister? You never said those. nope... We lived in a small hamlet. People know each other. There were no strangers over there. But in here, people don't know each other that well. and they don't contact at all. Just act like bunch of strangers. You come here. Who are you talking to? We are talking about his sister. You ought to know you shouldn't talk to strangers. But he is not a stranger. What did you say? He has a sister similar as my age. Could be a little elder, or a little younger... I didn't do any bad things. Wait until back home. Listen to me... Your sister didn't talk to me. Of course I did. Wait until we back home! Stop fighting! Here, grab some seeds. OK, I must head back to the barrack now. Don't be sad, kid. Later. Not bad. What? Your shoes. So what, they are not brand new. I know, but not long ago, they just been waxed. -Have you founded his home? -Yes. -Was he at home? -Yeah, but was showering. What if he wouldn't come? Beats me. What do we do now? Beats me. I left the message. Told him to come for a second once done the shower. Like your dad. Always having a bad mood before step into the shower. then just go to back directly. He probably won't come. Then what are we going to do next? I don't know. If the store is still opening, it should be got already. then so does the money. What? Could find some sticky stuff and stick that money up. Thief. I am not a thief. -You stole my Balloons. -Nonsense! You have to pay me back. Leave my brother alone. Let him go. -I am not for those money. -Let him go. -He comes for collect the money. -What money? -The goldfish money. -Look. So... Get up. Brother. I didn't see any money. If you aren't blind, drag you face close to the fence enough and look again. You will see it. Look. Loosen up. Let me go! It's useless. It can be reached if something sticky can be found at here. What? Like Chewing gums. Do you have gum? Where to get it? Do you think it can be sold in anywhere? You do it. -Got change? -I don't have any on me. Search carefully. -What do you need them for? -Do as what I said. My pockets never contain any changes. they are not heavy... Here. I always put tiny amount of changes into my pockets.
