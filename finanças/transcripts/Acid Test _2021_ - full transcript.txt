Where do I begin? My father would say, "Start with history." But do you start at the beginning of time or just current events? Anywhere in the world, or just at home? Our nation is the enduring dream of every immigrant who ever set foot on these shores and the millions still struggling to be free. This is a great contest between hope and fear. This is a contest between unity and division. A contest between the courage to change and the comfort of the status quo. We are looking on the edge of a revolution of young people who are starting to realize that we, our generation, put them four trillion in debt and they don't like it and they shouldn't. My name is Anita F. Hill. I was scared and I was alone. Can we all just get along? Can we get along? Maybe I should start with my story. So... Why Harvard? When I was nine years old, I visited Harvard with my dad. I remember standing in the Harvard Yard and seeing all the fall colors. It was like something out of the movies. I remember everybody there seemed so important, so serious, and that my dad was one of them. It was like the best of the best. And that's when I realized that I wanted to be one, too. - Hey, girl. - Hey. Let me see this. Uh, what asshole put AP chem first period? - I know, I'm gonna die. - Oh my God. How was your summer? It was fun. I hung out with Drea. Oh, good. Hola, chica. What is on the menu for today? I actually have AP chem first period. Oh my gosh. Same! We can be study buddies. Owen, I've known you since freshman year. We both know you don't study. Oh. You hurt me. Kelly Norman, what's up? Owen Riley, color me surprised. Well, enjoy your ridiculous science. I'll see you in English. Ready for chemistry? Good morning, and welcome to the wonderful world that I like to call AP chemistry. The wonderful world of AP chem. So what are you looking forward to this school year? What I'm really looking forward to is this year's election. And why is that? Because I'll be 18 in time. Have you been following the coverage? Oh yeah. When Ross Perot dropped out in July, I couldn't believe it. Was he the candidate you were going to vote for? Oh, no. But it made everything so much more interesting with his third party run. Let's sort of do a quick summary of what we discussed before in terms of where we are, then we'll go to the solution. I've offered a comprehensive plan. And my agenda for American renewal, an integrated, comprehensive set of answers. We're going to ask the rich to pay their fair share so the rest of America can finally get a break. I wish it were that easy, but it is not. And it will take new solutions, comprehensive solutions... Since we're dealing with voodoo economics, a great young lady from Louisiana sent me this voodoo stick and I will use it as my pointer tonight. Why is this an important year in US history? It's the year of the election. Why is this an important election? Because it's the President. This is the first presidential election since the fall of the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold War, followed by a brief but controversial Gulf War in the Middle East. Last year, a man was pulled from his truck and beaten by cops. This spring, the officers were acquitted, sparking riots that lasted for days. We're in an economic downturn. What is the temperature of the country right now? This year is touted as the year of the woman. There are how many female candidates on the ballot in November? How many of you will be old enough to vote? Congratulations, it is an honor and a right. This is one of the foremost pieces of literature in the world, quoted and analyzed to death, and you will do the same. I need four volunteers to read act one. Mr. Riley, how lovely to have you in my class, again. Always a pleasure. Mm-hm. All right. Okay, you three young ladies, please open your books. Ms. Johnson, how was your summer? It was fun. Thank you, how about yours? Short. Yeah. I'm applying early decision to Harvard and I would appreciate some help on my essay. Well, when you have a draft, we'll schedule some time. Tell me something I can't read in your application. Who are you? What are the things that make you, you? Movies, books, television, music. Everyone who applies for Harvard has an excellent GPA, is overloaded with extracurriculars, and some are legacies like yourself. What makes you stand out? So tell us about your interview. It was okay. You tell him about your 4.0, your literary magazine, all your classes? Oh mom, the mole is so good. Mm-hm. Delicious. It's pretty good. I think you should sign up for the SAT again. But I did so well. Statistics show that students score at least 100 points better the second time around. But I got a 1460. Then a 1560 would get you closer to a perfect score, won't it? So, how was your day, Jack? Upper management... Came up with some new nonsense and everybody nods their head and says, "Yes please, I want some more." Like lambs to a slaughter. Maybe you should do something fun this weekend. You know, go see a movie. Go for a bike ride. Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? You have no idea! Jack! Who am I?

Your father doesn't believe so he did not want you to be raised in the faith. But, I baptized you myself when you were babies. Who cares about what dad says? You are so lucky. My father didn't like for me to go to school. Even my own mother thought I should simply learn cooking and taking care of the house, but I wanted to go. I wanted to learn. I wanted to be a doctor. - Really? - Mm-hm. But my grades weren't good enough. And without the support of my family... Eh. But your father, he works very hard to give you the best.

Did you take every pamphlet we have out? Oh dear, what happened to Harvard early decision? That's still the plan. Just wanted to see what else was out there. What are you planning on majoring in? My dad says to keep my options open, excel in every subject and decide in college. Is that what you think? Well, see, I'm good at every subject so that's not really that big of a deal, but the only subject that I really love is English. Well, brown-nosing me isn't going to get you anywhere. I'm serious, I do. I love the words, the imagination, the impact but, like what career do you make out of this? Like a writer? Teacher? Tell me about the haircut. It's just a haircut. Not many people would make such a radical change. Well, I'm still me. Just wanted to try something new, something different. Is that important to you? Trying something new, different? Hm, we have big universities, small liberal arts colleges, Midwest, East Coast, California, Reed College. I like the nontraditional structure. Do you now? I don't know. I just... I don't know. It just feels like any and everything is interesting. Ah. Well, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Doesn't really matter where you go to college. What matters is what you do when you get there and what you do when you leave. Who you become in the process. How's the essay coming along? How am I even supposed to know what to write about if I can't even figure out where to apply to? Oh, that's the easy part. It's called a personal statement for a reason, because it's personal and it's a statement. Kinda like that haircut. Oh, when did this happen? Just needed something different. It's soft. You don't think I look like a dyke? You're still gorgeous, if that's what you're asking. Are you telling me you like girls? What do you do when everything just seems to be too much? Any and all mood enhancing substances. Not the biggest fan of alcohol, but it'll do in a pinch. How do you function at this school?

And I feel like an asshole because I know how much she sacrificed but, sometimes I just want a mom, you know? Someone to make me waffles and tell me to go to bed. Someone to wake me up if I've overslept and drive me to school. She's a survivor. She's like the fucking toughest person I know. But as soon as my brother and I were able to do some things by ourselves, she needed us to take some of that pressure off. Now it just feels like we're all just surviving together. Damn. Both my parents are role models in different ways. I appreciate my father's work ethic and my mom's devotion to the family. In my family, the man has all the power. If our bodies are a battleground, then what are our minds? Are they separate or the same? If you control my body, do you control my mind? There are no laws for thought, only for action. But people believe that if you control one, you control the other. Miss Johnson. This is a mess. "They're calling this the year of the woman and movements like Riot Grrrl that don't ask for equality but take it without apology. In my family, the man has all of the power, so how am I supposed to find my own?" Dissecting how society's patriarchal dynamics play out in your own family as you explore your independence as a woman is a good start, but this is an emotional torrent of victim hood. You're not showcasing how this will fuel your further studies or your contributions to society. This whole women in punk music is always talking about accepting your anger and standing up and fighting for your rights. It's all so inspiring but I just, I don't, I don't know. I don't know how to put it out there without sounding like a huge mess. Well you edit it. Use that critical mind you've honed here. Carving out sense from something emotional is difficult. Yes, especially when you're so biased, but not impossible. You think I'm biased? Well, let me ask you this, your mother chose your father and every time he acts like a patriarch, she chooses him again, why? So you're saying that she wants that? And that's not okay? You want your parents to respect your choices an adult. Can you accept theirs? Do you believe that your father, in his mind, is doing what he thinks is right? I mean, he could do it in a better way. Well, are you always doing everything to the best of your abilities? I was just, I'm just... I hate how I can't change anything. I mean he never listens. I have no power, my mom has no power. There is no perfect choice. Just a choice, which leads to another and another. But thinking and planning and stressing doesn't give you any more control over the outcome. Your father is still fighting that lesson. You have a chance to learn it now. Oh. This is so exhausting. Go back over your paper as if you were an admissions person. Use emotion where it's effective, but make sure the reasoning is sound. I just want to thank the three panelists and thank the three candidates for participating, President Bush, Governor Clinton and Mr. Perot.

I work so hard to make sure that you have anything you need and I'm some sort of monster? Your mother and I, we are partners. She is not a victim. You treat her like dirt. You never let her speak and you never let her speak Spanish to us, which probably makes you racist, which I don't even want to know what you think of me. And you think, you think that Mom agrees with you, because it's impossible for anybody to have another opinion other than yours. And you may not beat us, but you definitely control us. Hey, Jennifer.

For your reports on the election, I want you to watch the TV coverage tonight and write a summary of the event and its results. What if our parents won't let us stay up late? Get up early in the morning and read the newspaper. Mr. Riley. Can we do it as a group project? I suppose. Excited? What if I punch the wrong one and vote for Bush? You're not supposed to say who you're voting for. I said who I'm not voting for. Where is everyone? At some election night thing. They didn't make you go with them? They try and give me space.

Oh, are we breaking up all ready? I'm kidding. I voted with my dad. - Jesus, Mom. - Where were you? I was watching the election for my assignment. The election doesn't go this late. - I fell asleep on the couch. - What's going on? Aye Mija, I was not born yesterday. I will always worry about you. Hello. Hey asshole, you should get a life and stop calling teenage girls just to breathe heavily and not say anything, all right? Fuck off, don't call again. Are you kidding me? Drea, it's... It's Jenny. So, what happened? Um, Clinton won. Why does having sex mean you're now a woman? Why does it mean we have to be together? But not in Texas. I don't even know what I'm thinking or feeling. Although for a minute, I forgot about everything. We now have six women in the Senate and 47 in the House. Six out of 100 in the Senate and 47 out of 400 in the House isn't exactly a lot. Well it's more than before. We've had so many election cycles when we said this is the year when women are going to win and then, you know, something happens. That horizon of gender equity is limitless for us. And what we see today is simply a dress rehearsal for the day and time we meet in convention to nominate Madam President. So, is this change, or is this progress? Making me out to be the bad guy. You're driving a wedge between us. No, all I wanted- No, you read that essay. God damn it. Jack. Jenny. Hey.

Uh, do you go to Harvard? I graduated last year, now I oversee bonds in the city. So you're a legacy? Yeah. Lucky you. Well, it was great to see you again. And it was so good to meet you. Yeah, all right. Bye. Hey, dad. - Excuse me. - All right. Can we go? I'm kinda tired. We just got here. Some of these people may be your future. Hola, Johnson's residence. Hi, Mom. Could you come pick me up? I'm bored and Dad doesn't want to leave. Mija, give it a try. Not just for your future but for your father, too. Okay. Bye. Hey, where were you? Your father called. He is worried sick. He's on his way home. Why? He wanted to stay, I wanted to go, so I called a taxi. What's gotten into you? What's wrong? Everything is wrong, Dad. I don't want to go to Harvard and you're just not listening to me. Everybody gets nervous. It's perfectly normal. You're gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be fine. Is that the best hug you can come up with? Happy Friday. Owen. No way, J, what are you doing? Oh my gosh, thank you. Party at mine? Maybe. There's actually this concert coming up, yeah. Oh cool, scary chicks screaming. I can dig it. Hey, they're proving a point, you know, okay? They're angry, women are angry and they have every right to be angry about so many different things and you wouldn't know about this, okay? Okay, okay, you're right. You know what? You don't get it, whatever. Sorry, just stressed.

So, you want to go see a movie? No, I don't want to see a movie. Mikey, you wanna go see a movie? Harvard costs a lot of money and I'm not sending you halfway across the country if that's how you're gonna behave. I already told you I don't want to go to Harvard. All schools cost a lot of money. Then I'll apply for financial aid. - It won't be enough. - I'll get a job. Then I'll take a gap year, and I'll figure this out. Where are you gonna live? How are you gonna support yourself? You can't choose my path for me. So you expect me to pay for all of your choices, like the choice you made last night? You could have been severely injured. And you put your mother and me through hell. It won't happen again. I love you. I love you, too. Could you pass me the syrup? Can't believe I did something that crazy. Maybe you should just stick to other forms of escape. I just don't know what to do. My parents have spent a lot of money trying to help me, give me the best. In middle school I even spent some time in an institution. What, why? I'm better now. Functional, the doctors say. I pass my classes, I ace my standardized tests, haven't gotten arrested, play nice with others. So I made a deal with my parents, as long as I'm not slitting my wrists or jumping off bridges, they let me be. How can you be that honest? I'm a terrible Riot Grrrl. What?

Will you still be my best friend when we're real adults? Always. Congratulations. Early decision, Harvard. It's not binding, so I can still apply and decide in April. It's frowned upon. It's the best I can do right now. Nice work on the literary magazine. They're a little unpolished. I thought that was the point. "If it be now, 'tis not to come. If it be not to come, it will be now.
