What? There are 5 minutes left. LEE HEE-MIN EXORCIST SUCCESSOR UNWARE OF ABILITIES I'll accept the next 10! YEONDOO HIGH SCHOOL BUDDHIST SCHOOL BUILT ON OMINOUS GROUNDS Damn! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight! Aren't you... YOO JI-MIN UNSKILLED WOULD-BE EXORCIST Hey! YOO Ji-min! You live the closest. The ones who live close by tend to be late, sir. What? Nonsense. Just run along now. You! Over there. But she butted in! Come here. - But... - Name and class? I transferred to this school today, sir. So? I don't know anything and have to meet my homeroom teacher. Grade 11, class 5! LEE Hee-min. How'd you know that? I'm your homeroom teacher. Go there. Don't worry. He's not really a scary teacher. It's because he's the head teacher now. Really? Since when? Not sure. He's been that since I started. Thanks for the tip. We must be in the same class. SUL Ji-hyun? I'm LEE Hee-min. SUL JI-HYUN BRIGHT, ODD GIRL Meet LEE Hee-min, the new student. Introduce yourself. Hi, I'm LEE Hee-min. Pleased to meet you. He's a Taekwondo player who got hurt and rested a year. In Buddha's time, it's like a speck of dust. But to you students, it means something. He's a year older than you. It's his first time at a Buddhist school, so be nice. - Understood? - Yes, sir. HAN SO-YOUNG SUFFERS FROM A RECENT INCIDENT What are you doing? Matter is void. All is vanity. Stop staring at So-young's face and take your seat! Go on. Why you! Did you lose your mind while you were sick? What are you doing? Sorry, but the window... So-young? Be understanding. You know the saying, 'Being pretty is a sin'. It doesn't apply to the rest of you. Open your books! Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Wait. What was that? Thanks! It's my favorite. Give it back. Who are you? He is new in our class, but a year older, sir. Stop it, Hee-min. It's okay. If you want it, buy it yourself. Really? Happy now? Let go. Wanna get clobbered? 70 cents. What? The price of the pizza bread. Crazy son of a bitch! Let it go, Dae-young. You haven't changed a bit. How could you? What the hell are you saying? Fooling around like this when your girlfriend is hospitalized. Why pick on your juniors? - That's got nothing to do with this! - Yes, it does! How can you not visit my sister once? Are you really her boyfriend? But... Stop staring, bitches! The bell rang! Go to your damn classes! How much is this? Are you a shaman? It's my daughter's favorite. Didn't you hear me ask if you're a shaman? You are being rude. Look, shaman! Can't you see that there? See the cross? I don't sell to shamans. Scram! You're no better than me. You make a living shedding animals' blood too! Don't be rude! Crazy bitch! Get lost before I chuck salt at you! I wouldn't eat that if I were you. How can you stomach that? Goddammit! What the hell did you say, bitch! There's something here. SCIENCE LAB I knew it. I recognized you at the gate. You're the one who cut in! You're Mu-young's successor. What? I'm YOO Ji-min. My aunt told me about you. She's the principal here. How can you snoop around here alone like that? - Isn't that cruel to the spirits? - Sorry. You got the wrong guy. You saw something, didn't you? No, I didn't. Liar! You did! Think whatever you want. I can't see them. But I can sense them. Especially, here. I'm sorry. I have no idea what you're talking about. And it sounds creepy. I'm just an ordinary, new student here. I just got lost. Can I go now? Sure. Go outside to get to the grade 11 classes from here. The dean is guarding the overpass during class hours. Go down and out the back doors. Okay. Thanks. UNDER CONSTRUCTION OFF LIMITS I always cut to the chase. I'm not asking you to get married or to date me. I just asked if you're busy tonight. Are you mad? No. I'll see you later. Let's get to know each other. Okay? I guess. See you later. I'll wait till you come! Dang Heart Sutra. Why's it so hard! She probably left already. What now? Thank you, sir. Sorry! I gotta run! KIM SUNG-A JI-HYUN'S FRIEND WHO KNOWS A SCHOOL SECRET What did she say? Stupid bitch. I told her to do whatever she wants. Idiot! You always get dumped. Whatever! She's not my style anyway. She's not feisty like this one. Look here. Where's Na-young! You look good on camera! Shithead! I told you to erase that. - Shit! - Bitch! Hey! How dare you call her a bitch? Fuck! Stupid bastards. Why don't you train for the Olympics instead? Done training? Yup. It was brutal. You must be easy on them while I'm away. No way. How else would Jun-mo act up like that? HAN Na-young isn't dead yet. It's for protection. - Not a bad idea. - Fuck. Why keep it? Jun-mo! Be good when we're nice. See? It's a new flag. She must be back. - So it was her at the market? - Yup. Shaman? Are you home? May I help you? You're back! Where is your daughter? It was frustrating not being able to ask you stuff. I don't do readings anymore. I'm no longer a shaman. Go! Don't ever come back! We didn't come to see you. Did your daughter become a shaman now? I heard new shamans can do readings better. What the? Scram! I think I found it. MU-YOUNG TOP SHAMAN WHO LEADS SOULS TO THE AFTERLIFE Going somewhere? Mu-young called to say he found the shrine. It's a full moon tonight. We must get rid of it and set a trap. If we don't do it tonight, we may never catch it. SU-YEON MYSTERIOUS PRINCIPAL OF YEONDOO HIGH But is Mu-young really that good? He's the best shaman and exorcist in the country. I see. I met his successor today. But you think Mu-young made the wrong choice? No. I sensed a potent force. Though he said stupid things and made me mad. Can hereditary shamans see spirits? That kid can see spirits? Yes, but he claims he can't. He's a hereditary shaman and spiritualistic? He really is potent. He needs to be even more careful. Minor evil spirts will run away from him. But a great shaman like him can be possessed by evil gods. Make sure he doesn't break the traps and turn to the dark side. Watch and help him. Why'd you try to kill yourself? Tell me. What really happened that night? I'm not giving up on you, sis. So don't give up either. The diary! Come out! The booze is here. KIM Jin-gon! YOO Dae-young! Stop messing around. Come out. I got the booze. Where are you? Scared chicken, huh? What the fuck! Did he shit his pants? Du-shik, strip him. Yes, sir! You son of a bitch! Think I'm a loser? Huh? No, sir. Hey! Stop it. Du-sik was just playing. It's because of you two that this shithead acts up to me! I'm sorry, sir. Don't be a fuckin' loser! Forget it, man. Drink up. I'm outta here. Hey! What about SUL Ji-hyun? Why'd the bitch want to meet at the school? Let's wait a bit longer. Sung-a? I said to meet here like you said, but it's kinda creepy. Should we just go? If you don't show, they'll bully you at school forever. Should I text him and say something came up? Think they'll believe you? Just wait a bit longer. There's over an hour left till 10 o'clock. Should we go get what you left in the etiquette ed room? No. If we get caught by them now, you'll be in trouble. The security guard will start his rounds at 10 o'clock. Being here after hours can get you suspended. Since they'll be drinking, they'll be more than suspended. Let's keep waiting till then. I'm sorry, Sung-a. I know you're trying to help, but I'm scared. It's okay. That's what friends are for. Thank you, Sung-a. It's damn strong. What the hell? He's drunk already? Can't you hear that? Stupid! It's your girlfriend! So fuckin' hilarious! Good thing you didn't erase it. Look at the bitch's face! How much is this heart box? YEONDOO HIGH SCHOOL There's a strong sense of death in the air. This is the girl? As expected, she was killed. Yes. She died in a fire at school recently. Her mother is a shaman. The police couldn't determine the cause of the fire at the time. That's why she must've summoned her daughter's ghost. A fire? Did it happen when the fire trap was broken? Yes. I still don't know why the trap spell was broken. When your grandfather, an exorcist Buddhist, built a school there instead of a temple, he did it to change the evil forces to the pure spirit of the youths. You mean the traps fell apart because of the kids these days? Well... The world may talk badly about kids these days, but they've never changed. In any time and age, they always come to the world with the purest souls. Then the adults must be to blame. We show them things we shouldn't and let them hear what they shouldn't. We teach them hatred and root anger in them. Evil ghosts feed and grow on such human thoughts. We must find and destroy the shrine before dawn. We must find the ghost and set the trap. 2 out of 5 element traps are broken already. We must hurry. I'm 5 minutes late. SCHOOL GROUNDS OPEN TILL 22:00 YEONDOO HIGH SCHOOL Aunt Su-yeon! The earth trap is broken. What? I'm checking the CCTV files. I sense something. Someone is at the school. A human? I don't know if it was a human or a ghost yet. Listen carefully. Don't do anything. Ji-min! We must hurry. Looks like she summoned more than her daughter's ghost. FEBRUARY 14th, FRIDAY Why is she here now? Jeez! I'm sorry, sir. I had to come for something. Hey! SUL Ji-hyun didn't come. Call the bitch. I said call her! Fuck it. What? Are you out of your mind? Why can't I make calls? Hey! Get up. Fuck! Get up, guys! What's wrong? We didn't drink here, did we? This is where that bitch died! I must've dropped it here. Where is it? Did someone take it? Did I leave it in class? The main building must be locked. Maybe the new building is open. Who are you? A possessor ghost? Where is your host servant? Are you okay? Yes, sir. What was that? The ghost that the shaman must've been serving. That woman ran off with the car. Where would she go? Probably the shrine. Problem is... She broke off from the ghost she serves. So she means to take her daughter's ghost? I'm not sure yet. Let's go. We must find that shaman first. Mu-young! Look! Shitheads! Don't just watch and help! Your hand is bleeding. What if we're stuck here until the morning? Sorry. But this is hilarious. You acted like you can beat up ghosts. But look at you now! Are you fuckin' crazy! Son of a bitch! Stop! He's out of his mind! Crazy bastard! Where the ghost was summoned, did you find any peculiar objects? No, not really. Just a half-burnt doll. Did it look like those? Yes. It wasn't a summoning ritual. It's to kill for reincarnation. To bring back her daughter, she'll kill other children? What a vulgar idea from a third-rate shaman! The school! The ghost must be there. Go and save them! Hey! Guys? I don't feel good. Your nose is bleeding! Are you okay? Jin-gon! Get some tissue! Here. You okay? The bleeding won't stop. It's because you beat him too hard! He should go to the hospital. But what if we're stuck till morning? Why'd you hit him so hard! He shouldn't have acted up! Guys... Help! Help us! Help! Sung-a. What did you leave at the etiquette ed room? Let's go home now. I'll let you borrow whatever you need. Really? Yes. What is it? Your body! Come on, Hee-min. Let's get out of this labyrinth. Candy! I want it! Ji-hyun! Hee-min? Sorry. I didn't know you two were here. You're... He's new to our class. It's good to see you. I saw you earlier. You called for So-young and ran off. Kind of desperately, right? Ah, well... By the way, why are you here at this hour? Well... I'm glad you're here. Can you help me? So you want me to go through the vent, go to the next room, and open the door for you? Yup. Step on that to go up. But what did you leave behind? I'll go up and bring my bag. Okay. See you later. I can just bring it out for you. It's okay. I'll have to find it. It's something special. What is it that you're here for it so late at night? It's locked here too. Shit! We're fucked! Let's look for another way out. The main building! It could still be open! What? We can't go back there! We have no other choice, asshole! Or do you wanna all die here? Hey! What? Sorry, but I gotta go pee. Go. Can't you come with me? It's over there. Why the fuck do I have to hear you pee? I'll go with her. Du-shik! Stay right here, okay? Of course. Sorry about earlier. I lost it. Is your arm okay? Forget it. This is fuckin' nuts. Hey, Du-shik! Come here! Shit. Coming! Hey! Du-shik! Don't fool around. KANG Du-shik! Kyung-min! Check here. Back off! Are you in here? This sucks! ETIQUETTE ED ROOM Where did she go? Run! Why'd you run away? If the security guard catches us, we'll be suspended. That's the only reason? What do you mean? I saw the security guard earlier. His eyes looked strange. Don't scare me. What am I doing here? Why would my sister be here instead of the hospital? The diary! I can't unlock it! Move! Shit! Dae-young... Look. Dae-young. Help me! Help! I fell asleep? HAN NA-YOUNG We can't stay here like this. Let's go. No. I'm staying here. You can go. What are you talking about? You're going to stay here till morning? Let's go! Forget me and go! Want me to stay here with you? No, it's okay. Sung-a will come here. Go out the gym in the new building. But she's been long gone. Just go. Fine. I'll go. Come out carefully. It was you? What? You're the one who broke the traps? What do you mean? Whatever! Just get out! Don't tell me what to do. This is my class. You met someone here, didn't you? The security guard. And? Ji-hyun. There's someone else here besides HAN So-young? So-young is at school? Never mind. Anyone else? And Ji-hyun's friend, Sung-a. I went to the etiquette ed room for her. Who? What's with that look? That girl... She's not human. Sung-a died last year in a fire in science lab. What about Ji-hyun? She could be human or maybe not. No way! Don't doubt someone without even seeing them. Here's a word of advice. Fools believe only what they see. It's easy for ghosts to fool your eyes. What's that? It's the Om. Evil ghosts can't cross that. That's why the entire school was built with it. First, let's find So-young. Right. So-young... If we can't find her here, she must've left and we should go too. You start looking here. I'll search over there. HAN So-young! Hey! Wait up! No! Where's So-young? So-young... She suddenly vanished. I told you they'll trick you! Does that mean So-young is still alive? Not sure. But she must be here in the school. What's that? It's the gym. The pool! The water trap is still standing! Wait! What happened? Didn't you go home? I know who you are. Really? I know you too. Mu-young's successor. I'm not Mu-young's successor! What did you do with So-young? Where's Ji-hyun? Amusing. Ji-hyun was with you. Where is the real Ji-hyun! I wonder where. But So-young is over there! She got curious to know what she shouldn't. So I got curious too. If she learns her sister's evil truth, what would she do? Amusing, huh? So-young! No! She wants you to break the last trap! You can't come back! Sorry. No! An exorcist blinded by love? Interesting. Everything that exists has its own purpose. You'll be the helper to the kid I found. So what happened? Aunt, tell me the truth. I'm not fit to become an exorcist, am I? Get it now? Living is a disaster. Disappointments after disappointments, then you die old! Ji-min! No! Ji-min! Ji-min! Ji-min... Hee-min... Protect the world... Ji-min! Wake up! Focus! Aunt Su-yeon... Mu-young saved you from the ghost. What? Then where's So-young? What? And Hee-min? Then why isn't Hee-min back? How dare you! Do you think you can avoid your fate? Foolish woman! Mom? Where are we? Let's go home, please? Please save my daughter! How'd you know I live here? So it's true your mom really is a shaman? That's sick. I'll get you at school. Why are you a shaman? Can't you stop it? I lost all my friends because of you! I hate this! When this school was built, the best Buddhist monk set spell traps here. It'll hide you well and you won't have nightmares. Really? If we move here, I'll make a shrine in a condo. You want me wear this to school? It's ugly. Forget it. Okay, fine. You found a new school for me. I'll wear it. No big deal. I'd do anything for my daughter. I love you, Mom! Me too. LEE Hee-min! LEE Hee-min! HAN So-young! Where is she? Sung-a. Dae-young asked me out. Your spell must've worked! Really? You're the best! I'm so glad. Congrats! Hey! Did you break up with Dae-young? I heard he's dating HAN Na-young. No. Who says I did? How dare she act up and flirt with my boyfriend! Makes me so mad. Then she needs to be punished. Fuck. Sounds fun! Why can't I go to Dae-young's birthday party? I can't tell you that. Sung-a, just tell me the truth. You don't want me to date Dae-young? Do you like him? What? No way! Then what's with you? Why keep trying to stop me from meeting Dae-young? Because I spend time with him? SCIENCE LAB Where's HAN Na-young? Na-young! I'm here! You're a shaman, huh? You told HAN Na-young not to hang out with us, bitch? Where's Na-young? You said she's hurt! How touching! This fuckin' turns me on. I've never seen two girls at it! - What? - Hey. Can you read me? Can you tell what I'm thinking? Fuck. I can tell what you're thinking. Bitch! Where's Na-young? Tell me! Where is she? Du-shik! You're on camera. Hold still! Let go! Stay still! Smile! Stop! Where is she! Hold still, bitch! Stop! Sexy lips! You bastards! Say cheese! Na-young? It's Na-young! Get her! Get that bitch! That woman! Her curse is not complete yet. What do you mean? The first girl! HAN Na-young is still alive. We can still stop it. - We can stop her! - Huh? May I help you? Time flies... HAN Na-young. Pardon? The last of the six who must die! HAN Na-young... Please stay back! No! No... No! This can't be! Sung-a... No... It's your fault. It's all your fault! It's because of you! It's all your fault! It's because of you! How could you... So-young... LEE Hee-min? Why are you here like this? Let's go back to where we're supposed to be. Where we're supposed to be? Yes. Everyone's waiting. No. I wish I didn't know. I don't think I can look at my sister anymore. It's not your sister's fault. You know that. No, it is her fault. The kids told me that she was close with you. I don't know anything. Kids avoided her because she's a shaman's daughter. I just hung out with her because I pitied her. Maybe she went to make a spell. Her friend died while trying to save her. I didn't know she could lie so easily like that. That's not it. Na-young felt terrible. So she wrote everything here and tried to tell the truth. What do you mean? Why didn't she tell me before? To protect you. Dae-young and his gang gave that picture to Na-young. They threatened to do what they did to Sung-a to you. PLEASE GIVE THIS TO THE POLICE. I'M GOING TO SEEK SUNG-A'S FORGIVENESS. I'M SORRY I COULDN'T BE WITH YOU. YOUR SIS, NA-YOUNG She wanted you to read that, then tried to go to Sung-a. Let's go and deliver her diary. POOL EXIT LEE Hee-min! LEE Hee-min! Let's go. Hee-min! HAN Na-young! Where is she? Hurry! HAN So-young! Wake up! So-young! Are you okay? Where's Hee-min? I missed you. I missed you so much. Don't go soft on me. It could collapse. Let's leave. I can't go with you. What do you mean? Because you're not Ji-hoon. Don't you recognize your friend who died because of you? When I'm... wandering in this hell because of you? That's exactly why. Ji-hoon would never be here. That's because you don't know anything. What do you mean? You knew about Mu-young. Your grandfather. Your dad, you've never met, didn't die in an accident. It's because he ran from his fate over a woman. Then his fate fell on you, his son. Mu-young knew that. But he got scared. That you'd run away like your dad. He took me, an orphan, as his godson, so you won't awaken until an adult. I was adopted to be a charm against evil for you! What do you mean? Why should only Sung-a die? Why should only Sung-a die? It's not fair! Why Sung-a… Still, you're not Ji-hoon. Of course, you're not Sung-a, either. I know the real Sung-a. Mom! Sung-a told me everything. When you went to Na-young, the real Sung-a was the one who saved her. And she asked me... To save her mom from you. Mom... Damn evil ghost! No! Look! She's your daughter. What you summoned was a demon! Mom... No! It can't be! Mom. We had it really hard in life, huh? Living felt like a disaster for me, Mom. You must've felt the same, right? I said I'd never be born your daughter again. I'm so sorry I said that. Then you said you'll have to see my face a lot in this life. I was so mad when you said that. But I want to be born as your daughter in my next life too. Can I do that? Mom. Hee-min, you were not just my successor. You're my only family. Hee-min! Wake up! Stop yelling. My ears hurt. Jeez. Stupid! Why'd you go in there? What if you couldn't come back! Why are you so worked up? I'm glad you're back. Hee-min? Are you okay? Yes, So-young. How about you? I'm fine. Thanks for saving me back then. No worries. It was nothing. Stop! Stupid. It was nothing? Hee-min! Must I lock you up in hell for you to come to your senses? I could hear your voice even in there. You heard my voice? You called me so loudly! What are you, my girlfriend? Whatever. I'm leaving. Thanks Ji-min. I'm back thanks to you. Are you two dating? - No! - No way! Hello? She is? Really? My sister woke up! See you later. Why? Disappointed? Thought she'd kiss you if you saved her? Running away again? I'm not running away ever. What's this? What do you think? It's Valentine's Day. Look. Hey! LEE Hee-min!
