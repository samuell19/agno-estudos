POLICE SIREN - What happened ? - The bandit, lady! - Ignazio the Press, huh? - Always him ! - He took revenge on a spy last night. We can't take it anymore! - Here we go. - Good morning. - Health, Donna Teresa. - Hello Mom. - Good morning, Valeria. (TERESA) Rosina! Lady, stay here! I was worried with all these soldiers around. They are not military, they are the police. What does that have to do with anything ? They also pinch, they are young men! - Madam, will they take them this time? - Let's hope ! But who knows how much more we will have to suffer. Is it true that brigands, when they take someone, torture them? But what tortures! They just want the money. Here it is. I've been stocking up all week. It is best to buy everything in bulk so you can save money. This is the cake for Sunday, keep everything and lock it. Now I'll give you something else. These are the beans for tonight. There are 97, last time we did 100, but they hurt us and I took away 3. What are you doing? I was making coffee for Mr. Antonio. Mr. Antonio wakes up at this time! Hey! How much do you put? You want him badly! Now I'll show you how much Don Antonio must drink. Here it is. That's okay, close everything and keep. I'll bring it to him, he's very happy if I bring it to him. Rosina! Is this coffee coming or not? How many times do I have to say that I want to be obeyed? - I'm in charge of this house, right? - No ! Exactly, not me, the one who commands is you. You are the mistress, you have the scepter. There are people who get angry when they don't have coffee in bed. But I say, is it worth getting angry? No ! Coffee, either they give it to you before or they give it to you later, it's always coffee. It's the same. - Teresa ... - What is it? - This is half a cup. - It's too much for a sleeper like you. I'm a sleeper and would have to ingest a lot of coffee to be awake - A lot of coffee is bad for you. - It hurts me ! - Too much coffee is bad! What's up ? - It's a ciofeca! - It's bitter. - Unsweetened ! Have you forgotten about diabetes? - Diabetes? - Yes. - Are you crazy? - So I have it? - I've never had diabetes. Oh yes ! My father was affected. Then you are affected too, the diseases are hereditary. I look like my mother, I am maternal. - My mother was healthy as a fish. - I understand, you are maternal. - Rosina. - (ROSINA) Madam. - Bring the sugar bowl. - (ROSINA) Right away! - We need a little more sugar. - Teresina! - What's up ? - You went out ? - Yes. - Do you dare to go out alone, without me? - Do I have to go out with you? - Are you crazy? - Because ? - The countryside is overrun with bandits. - They don't do anything to me. - They don't hurt you? You are the tastiest morsel in the country. - Because ? - Because ? Because we are rich! We are ? I am rich. - You are rich and I am poor, we are the rich and the poor. - I'm rich. You have the goods, I love you ... It's all a family kindness. But what family benevolence? I don't like this commonality. Teresa, listen and CONVENE ME. If the bandits, we make the horns, kidnap you, - who should pay the ransom? - You with my money. Here's the sugar bowl, lady. Give me, here, a moment. I have to see something. - What's up ? - There is no more. What ? There are thieves in the house, they stole the sugar. - But who would steal the sugar? - I put the mark. - The sign ? - Yes. - What did you wear? - I put a fly in the sugar. - Aaahh! - When the lid is lifted, the fly flies. - Fly. Now what has flown? Nothing ! The fly has already flown before. - It is allowed ? - Who is it ? What's up ? - The electricity bill. Uuuhh! Even the electricity bill! Here, I come. Dammela. - I paid for it the other day. - No, he paid for it the other month. (TERESA) Wait, let me see. 3,000 lire? - Moscow, huh? But not the one that flew. - (TERESA) But that's a lot! &gt; Madam, there is the TV, the water heater ... My 3,000 lira ... Since there is a television in this house, there is an incredible consumption of electricity . Damn when they gave us that device! I'm going to get the money, with permission. Wait a moment. (TERESA) Mamma mia, 3,000 lire! Aaahh! To us! Poor dreamer ! The money is here. But what an illusion! I leaned near the drawer, slipped with my hand - and I went into the trap. - Who goes to these seas ... These traps takes. Can you take it off me, please? Now I'd leave it to you until lunchtime. The Chinese cut off the stealing hand. - Ah! - Dai. - Aaahh! You are worse than the Chinese. Here. - Sir, come out. - Yes, ma'am. How hot ! Rosina, do you want to stake 50 lire? - Lord, you always win. - What does that have to do with anything ? - It depends on how the wheel turns. - The wheel always turns on your side. This month you have already won me 650 lire. What do you want them to be? Tricks! Come on, 50 lire. Right away, on your feet. - Have you seen? - Yes. - Get it right. I shuffle the cards. No makeup, huh? - This ! - Yes, I knew it. So it's 700 ... Why are you hanging around in the kitchen? I came to the kitchen to smell the smells. - There are no smells here. - I know. Rosina, take the plate of appetizers. - Appetizers ? - Yes. - Then it will rain today. No, I made the appetizer because I didn't make the second dish. - Ah! It seemed strange. - It seemed odd. It seems to me that it is enough, right? Either one or the other. Either the appetizer or the main course. Teresa, do you think this would be the appetizer? - Isn't that an appetizer? - Three olives. - Three olives. How many people are we at the table? Three people, one olive each. Yes, then the olive is heavy, it hurts. - Mmmm ! - What have you got there? - The wisdom tooth. - The wisdom tooth? - The wisdom tooth. - Are you growing up now? - What pain! - What pain! - Let me see. Come here, I want to see you. I was choking! - It passed me. - Has it passed you? - The pain is gone. - Suddenly ? - Yes. - It's not possible. Do you want to know better than me that I am the master of pain? - The master of pain. - Don't tell heresies! - The master of pain ... - Stop ! Nobody comes out! - What happened ? - An olive is missing. - It is not possible. - There were three, now there are two. - Take out the olive. - But who took it? - I do not know. - Where is the third olive? - Aren't they three? No, there are two. - You do not see ? There is not. - Did you get the olive? - Who took it? - It will have fallen. - Fell ? What a combination! Your own fell. - Here we go. - Are you sure it was mine? - Antonio! - Immediately ! - Aren't you dressed? - I can't do this, I need an undergarment. - What undergarment? - You see ? You are already angry. - I'm not angry, what should I give you? - I need a clean shirt. - I just gave you a clean shirt. - 15 days ago! Do you want to wear a shirt for less than 15 days? - How long do I have to wear it? - At least for a month! - A month ? - The laundry is damaged if it is washed too much. - Yeah, it spoils. - Sure. - Mine got too dirty and I need to change it. - All right. I take the shirt. - Here's the new shirt. - Thanks. I do not understand, 15 days, a shirt! A clean person wears it for at least 2 months. - I'm clean, so I'll wear it for 6 months. - Humorous ! If a person takes a bath in the morning , the shirt does not get dirty. But at my age I can go around ... Do you think it's a shirt? - Don't you like the cut? - Cutting ? It's all cut up. If I feel bad and they take off my jacket, what do I look like? - Do you think this is a shirt? - What you see is a shirt. What you do not see is useless to do, it is wasted cloth. - Hey! - Who is it ? - Good morning. - What he wants ? Who are you looking for? - Excuse me if I drove in here , but ... - What car? - It's not a Mercedes, but ... - You can also see it with the naked eye. - What does he want ? - Well ... It's a little delicate. Go ahead, but hurry up because I'm busy . - Law ? - No. - So what are you doing? - Study. - Are you a journalist? - It shows ? Damn ! I was hoping to look like a hunter ... In short, quite another thing! All the reporters who come here want to look like something else, - that's why they recognize each other immediately. - Dog fate! - You too came to interview Ignazio il Torchio. - Yup. - Nobody has done it yet. - I have to do it. - Because ? - My manager told me: - '' Alberto ... '' Alberto is me. Alberto Lavia. - Pleasure. He told me: `` Alberto, if you don't bring me the interview, I'll throw you in the middle of the street. '' - How old is he ? - 57. - He wears them well! - But I'm talking about her. - Ah! 26. - Wife? Sons ? - No. - Fortunately! - Because ? At least it will remain alone on the road. - Thanks for the good wishes. - Please, what can I do for you? Tracking these bandits, you know the area. Do you think it's easy? Even the police can't. They hide from the police, but what can they fear from me? If I could get close to their hiding place! If she succeeds, they will certainly not show themselves to her. But I have a plan, look. TOWARDS OF THE NIGHTINGONE FROM THE WHISTLE - The nightingale. It's cool, huh? - But what does it have to do with the bandits? - What month is it ? - We are in October. The bandits know that nightingales don't sing in October . Then they'll think: '' It's someone making a signal. Let's go see who this idiot is. '' - They go out and find her. - Exactly. Excuse me, but you are the most candid man I have ever met. - I look a bit stupid, right? - No. - Certain ingenuity is almost tenderness. - Then he'll help me. Before arriving at the stream there is a path that no one knows. The entrance is hidden by an old oak, I discovered it as a child. I went up to the woods to pick mushrooms. Try there, maybe it's the right way. Thanks, I'll go there today. Go now, so he'll let me study. - See you later. - Good luck. And don't be imprudent. Sit ... If I find something important, can I come and tell him tonight? Yes, but provided that it is indeed something very important. Sure, goodbye. See you later. Professor, is that okay? Unfortunate, what have you done? You ruined me! - Don Peppino, come here. - Say, professor. - Look at what a masterpiece! - What did he do ? - Watch. - He told me '' all'Umberto ''. - So ? - Umberto takes them like this. - Which Umberto? - The washerwoman's son who came out of reform school. Imbecile! This you misunderstood, professor. Take a seat, I'll make them longer. I put in some grease ... But don't worry, they look good on you. He has brought out your features, you have the delicate features. - And then the head stays cool. - Yes and winter is coming. Exactly ... it's fresh. - I have a cool head. - This guy... He knows how to do Umberto hair well , but as soon as the subscription ends, I won't come in here anymore! - The subscription has already ended. - Since when ? - For a month. That's why I didn't want to go there! Come here, you idiot, so you ruin my clientele. So you ruin my clientele. Do you want to be a hairdresser? Ours is a mission, remember! We are missionaries. It is a mission of civilization. I don't want to see you, go away! Did you understand ? Go away ! Don't look me in the face. Ignorant! Imbecile, he doesn't even know who Umberto is. That's the best customer and he has the motorcycle too, you fool! - Bad barber, is there a lot to wait? - But there is none. As always. - Then why are you asking? - These are words that are said. When you go to the barber shop you say: 'Is there a long time to wait?' Questions to waste time. Boy ! - Give it to me. - No. - Give it to me, I'll keep it. I see you a little nervous. - No, but with that ... - Nice that calendar! Look. - Look over there. - What am I looking at? - The calendar, is it new? - Yes, it's new. - It's very beautiful. You also put in the new card! - Forget the card, I need it. - I need it too. What do you have to do? Sometimes I'm away from home, I have to pack a few, something ... New purchases, huh? - New purchases! - It's good stuff, it defies the ages. - Where did you buy it ? - A salesman brought it to me ... - Defy the centuries? They screwed you. - But ... - They screwed you. - This is better. - It's more resistant. - It's more resistant. It's rhino bone. That's what the ... - You can smell the forest. - This is tough. - Then you do it on purpose. - He gave you the stuff you don't need. - But you have iron hands. - (ANTONIO) Iron hands! How sad this shop is! How sad! - Now I'll put the ballet on. - Oh yes ? Will you put the ballet in there? - It is the country that is sad. - It's true, it's different in Rome. In any barber shop you will find modern comfort. - Sure. - Radio, magazines, newspapers ... Manicure ! - That's Rome. - Not only in Rome, in all of Romagna! Other people, other history, other lineage, other way of thinking ... - The Romagna empire ... is what it was. - Roma the master of the world ! We from Romagna have commanded the world . - Were you born in Rome? Are you ROMANESE? - No. - You said ... - Okay, but we're Italians. - I know. - Would you like to go to Rome? - Yup. - Why don't you go there? - It's not easy. - Do you have the money? - No. - So ... - You give them to me. - How can I do ? My wife doesn't even leave a penny in my pocket. By the way, you owe me 10 beards, 2 haircuts and a shampoo. - This is a detail! - It's an important detail. - I know, but it's a detail. - Take a seat. Peppino, we 've known each other for a long time, give me the tu. - I don't dare, for heaven's sake! - Come on, give me some tu. Dai! Dai! Okay ... sit down. - I can't, but ... sit down. - Peppino, you told me '' sit down ''. - Sit down. - To me ? Are you calling me you? - How dare you ? - You said: '' Let's talk about you ''. - When ? - Now. - Now ? - I wouldn't have allowed myself. - If I told you ... - Yes! - But don't take advantage of it. - There is nobody. - All right. Accomodatevi. I knew it ! I knew it ! I knew it ! Blessed God! - But it's your fault. - '' The place is sad ''. And it's always in here. The fault is yours, but don't be angry. - Take this into account too. - But I'm jealous of my stuff. Another mistake. In Rome, barbers are not jealous. - If I could go to Rome to have fun ... - Maybe! - Seven, eight days of vacation ... A week-UENDS. - That ? A weekend. I have half an idea. I have half an idea, but you should COOPERATE ME. - That ? - You should COAD ME. - What is it? - You should help me! - All right. - You should become my accomplice, I run. - Is that honest? - Very honest. - So ? - My wife doesn't get a penny. But if the prospect of making a deal is presented to her, she opens the bag. (ANTONIO) Tonight you'll come to my house for lunch , then I'll explain. With you I would like to settle everything. I'd like to settle that beard business. - Those are ... - No, now I'll take care of it. - I marked it ... - I'll take care of it. - Now we play them. - I lose with this game. When you lose, you have to insist because then the right time comes. - This is your turn. - I don't like this game, that's how you lose! It depends on how the wheel turns, it's your turn. Choose your card. - Choose the card. - I play. - And play! - All ! - All. - All ! - Here. - Look at her well. - Stop! - I will not move. - Did you see her ? Do you remember her? Put it in the deck. - Melee. - Immediately ! - Now, here! Don't be afraid, I have nothing. So ... It's this one. You lost. I didn't want to play, I knew it. I have one more thing to tell you. You're coming to lunch tonight, right? Do you know what system my wife came up with when she got a guest? - No. - I'll explain everything, you need to know ... - Good evening, Don Peppino. - Who is it ? - It's me. Teresa, the '' Figaro '' has arrived! - Our welcome guest. - (PEPPINO) Thank you. Oh ! Accomodatevi ! I'm glad you came. The water is on the fire, everything is ready, now we sit at the table. - What did you bring? - 200 grams of spaghetti, two sausages, - and the apple. - That's all ... - Everything. - That's all ... - Yes. Sorry, I have to tell my husband something. - Didn't you tell him anything? - I told him. - He brought food just for him. - He misunderstood. So what do I do? I lose the water, the fire, the seasoning, the appetizer, the manufacture for its beautiful face? - He misunderstood. - You didn't explain it well. Peppino, you do certain things to me ... - Because ? I do not understand. - You do not understand anything. - What did I do wrong ? - One invites you to lunch and you bring only the food for you. What are we doing ? The games? We put in the water, the fire, the seasoning, the manufacturing and the famous appetizers that my wife makes. - But you said: '' Bring the food. '' - Food, generic! Ah, '' eat '' ... Don't '' eat '' ... Eating is eating, it is feed. My wife has a custom, when a guest comes, it is done in the Roman style. We put hot water and the guest brings ... - Now how do you do it? - Everything is fixed. - Only for death there is no remedy. - For charity ! - It is the habit of the house - You came with your bicycle, right? - Yes. - Take your bike and go to town, but you have to take a run. - Buy two kilos of sausages, two kilos are enough? - Yup. - Do you want a side dish? - Yes, the fries. Buy half a kilo of potatoes. Half a kilo of potatoes, two kilos of sausages and two kilos of pasta. Whether they are bucatini, my wife likes '' bucatina ''. - How do we do it? - With butter. - Do you like butter? - No. - We do. - We like it. - Buy half a kilo of butter. - Fruit ? - Yes. - Assorted. Fresh or dry? - Fresh. - My wife likes bananas, buy half a kilo of bananas. - Grapes! Bananas, grapes for us. You have the apple, you don't need it. - Wine? - There is not. - Buy two bottles of wine. - It is not too much ? - No, we save it for tomorrow. - Yup. - Do you have the money in your pocket? - Yes. - Go, my son. I buy ... Yeah! - So ... here. The sausages ... - Hurry up. - The Apple... - The apple, keep it for him. - Roman style. - Roman style. Go, hurry. Peppino, hurry up because the water is boiling. I have served you. - At the table ! - You never get old at the table . - Here it is. - I made little pasta because I don't eat any in the evening . - Enjoy your meal. In the evening it is heavy for me. Lady, they made a joke on me, they chained my cutlery. - No, it's my wife's custom when there is a guest. - I'm silver. - Thanks for the thought. - You're welcome. So, Teresa ... - It's the chain, it's chained. - I know. - But I have to eat. - I lend him my fork. - No, I can't lend it to you. - I make do. - Arrange. Teresa, our friend Peppino, present here, as you can see, - he accepted our invitation to lunch ... - And I am grateful to you. Peppino, please! He would like to offer you a deal, - a big deal! - To me ? - Yes, to you. - Be... As you well know, he ... - Who is it ? - He who? - He what? - Who is he? - He you! - Ah, me! - I said him, he. - I heard "he". - I was speaking in the second person. Ah ! - You know that ... - We are first. - Exactly. You know he - is an experienced hairdresser. - What an expert! - No, you're good. Don't make me angry, you are expert. I tell you that I have traveled the world. He is an experienced hairdresser. He would like to open a large shop in Rome , a spectacular thing, a palace! - No ! Three ... - Three buildings! - Three buildings? - Not three buildings, one. - A three building ... - One! - A shop with three buildings. - I'd like to talk. - You make me confused. - Let me do the talking. - A three-door shop. - A palazzo against the door? - A "hairdresser for ladies". - Here, a coffee for Dante, three doors, though. - '' Pour dames ''! - When ... - Dante comes ... - No, when the ladies ... - Dante's ladies, - They come to the door ... - In the shop. - You're making me "drunk". - A hairdresser. - A beauty institute ! Good idea ! - Eh! - Mom, think what comfort for us! We could get massages every day , hands, head ... - Your mother should just get her head. - Yes, some styling. Lady, I would put my modest work, and as you said before, it is what it is. You would put the capital and divide the profits by 50%. - It's a great idea, I really like it. - We could all move to Rome. - Good ! - There is the Colosseum. - How long would it take to do this? - 5 million. - 5 million. - 5 million? - You are crazy ? - Even more ! - Exactly, are you crazy? Even more ! If you want to do something elegant, you need at least 10. It's a soup, the longer you put in, the more you find it. - We need armchairs, mirrors, machinery ... - Helmets, too. - No. - Yes, helmets. - not me. - The helmets! - Ah! The helmets! - The helmets on your head. - Yes, those are ... They are used to dry the hair. What would you call this place? - '' Da Peppino. '' - It's a good idea. In Rome all the hairdressing shops ... '' Da Peppino '', '' Da coso '' ... It is a very good idea, I would put the capital because it is secured money. - It's safe, sure. - What did I tell you? - But I would if Peppino weren't you. - Here. You are the antithesis of the hairdresser. Two years ago you had my daughter and me permed. - After ten minutes we had hair like that. - It was a wet day. - How disgusting ! I remember. - And the pharmacist's wife made the tincture. - Green hair! - That chemical was not good. But be patient! The chemical preparation! And you dare to offer me the company? You made me nervous. We don't eat anymore. Don Peppino, do me the favor! You know where you need to go ... You presented the deal badly. Mah ! What an invitation to lunch! Without a cup of coffee, a glass of fresh water ... Deluded! Did you want coffee? - My wife makes coffee in the morning with chicory. - What a mentality! SHOTS - Your wife shot herself ! If only she had shot herself! It is Ignazio the Press. - Ah! - Maybe he's doing some kidnapping. There is war in this country. Every now and then ... Pim! Pam! These bandits! Why don't you tell Ignazio il Torchio to kidnap your wife? - So you get rid of her. - Wanted heaven! But who takes it? Who takes it? PEPPINO CANTICCHIA I have an idea. Nobody can take eight days of revelry in Rome! - But you must be my accomplice. - Yes, so we end up as before. - Let's make another good impression. - Don't raise your voice! (SUBHEADING) - I don't. - Pull over. - Ah! - What happened ? - The finger ! - You hold your hands like this! But are they holding their hands like this? I would like to know where to keep them. Ah! The other ! - Bimano! - Come on, talk. Hands are held like this. Yes, speak. Can you write a threatening letter? Ssshh! I can write, but I've never written to the miner. What does the miner have to do with it? Minatory, that is, a blackmail letter. No, for heaven's sake, you can recognize the handwriting. - It's true. - Why don't you write it? You are crazy ? So they recognize my handwriting and I go to jail. - And do I have to go to jail? - You're a barber. - Do barbers go to jail? - They can go to jail. - Nobody forbids them to go to jail. - I don't want to go there. - I understand, this is it. - So ? - Listen... - Yup ! - Ah! - I leave. - Wait up. - Take your foot off! I'm a genius. We take some newspapers, with a scissor, zac, zac, zac ... And that's it! Come with me. But you are bulky, why don't you pay attention? - I leave. - You're bulky and loud. - Shut up ! - No, I'm going away, I don't! TOWARDS OF THE NIGHTINGONE FROM THE WHISTLE - Good evening. - Ah, it's her! Good evening. Can you come down for a moment? Come closer. There is a ladder under there. Thanks. So ? - I wanted to give you this. - What is that ? - Mushrooms! - Mushrooms? You are crazy. I had authorized her to call me only for important news. - I have something very important to tell you. - OK then. Let's go there. (PEPPINO) Called the Press. (PEPPINO) Now you need an '' O '', a letter '' O ''. (ANTONIO) '' O '' like '' Turin ''. - But there is not ? - There is not ? - There is not. - I cut out ten! I know... There it is. - It was stuck. - The glue. - It's already there. - Sorry. - You always keep your head forward. - Done. - '' Press ''. - The attack. Wait, more glue. Not much ... here. So ... As a threatening letter, this is fine. - Madam ... - Where is she? - Who ? - My wife. - Where is it ? - The Lady. Hide. We do not know each other. Peppino, is she gone? - It's passed ? - My wife ? - Your wife ? Zitto! - Antonio! - Shut up ! - Where did you see her? - I didn't see her, I said '' lady ''. Now I'll blind you one eye. - Let's do it soon. - You said: '' Madam ... '' '' Madam, you are almost a widow and you really will be if you don't bring it tonight, to the Toad's Well ... '' - Gods? - Of the Toads. - Cretin, ignorant. - '' Toads '' with a '' P ''. - We need one. No, '' toads '' is plural, two '' P '', '' ROSPPI ''. - '' Toad '' is a lonely toad. - You are right. But they are banished, they are ignorant. I take responsibility. - '' 5 million ... '' - Do you think I am worth 5 million? - Never mind. - Am I not worth more? - Never mind. - No, let's say this, it's important. - What do you want to know? - Am I worth less than 5 million? - It doesn't suit you. He goes to look for the bandits and starts picking mushrooms. He promises me sensational news and says nothing. It happens to me often. I am a shy one. Lately I was commissioned to interview a Polish baroness, an adventurer, one of those women for whom men shoot themselves. I managed to approach her, I was triumphant. But he made me tell about my life from First Communion onwards and from her I learned nothing. I don't expect you to tell me about your life. - Tell me this important thing, otherwise ... Good night. - All right. (SUBHEAD) Courage. Today, while I was in the mountains, in the middle of those woods, I've always thought of her. Picking the mushrooms? - But if you hardly know me! - It's not true. Sometimes a minute is enough to ... I know everything about her. For a shy person, that's not bad. So she knows everything about me. So let's see ... How am I with the young men? It is not very '' flirt '', then, however, he cannot understand why they behave badly towards her. This is true. But why does it happen to me so often? Because ... he's shortsighted. - And what's that got to do with it? - She is... She is beautiful. Like all short-sighted people, bring your face close to the person you are talking to. He gets too close and ... I did not understand this, you are very observant. Damn when I told him! Do not get angry, if you want, I can approach him on purpose. You're very kind. I will be very jealous. - It's late tonight to introduce yourself to Mom. - You'll do it tomorrow. Here, this is the place. This is the place, you hide back there. I pass and as soon as I get here, you say: '' Hands up! '' - I raise my hands and you catch me. - Why do I have to do this? To get us a testimony, someone to see us and say: '' Yes, I saw it! Mr. Antonio was kidnapped by bandits. - Poor Signor Antonio! '' - I understand. - There are people. - Shall we make the scene? - This is the moment. I come casually. - Are you ready ? - I'm ready. - Hands up ! - Here I am ! - Hands up ! - Here I am, I ... Gee, those are carabinieri. This is the right time, there are people. - Hands up ! - Who is it ? - Hands up ! - The revolver. - I kill you ! - Cretin, the revolver! - Barber, the revolver! - Hands up ! - Here I am. - They saw us, right? - Walk. - Here we go. Walk! Don't do that. Mamma Mia ! ROSINA CRIES Stop crying! What a fear, lady! I still see that brigand in front of me. - What direction did they go? - Towards the mountain, all three. All three ? Who were they? The master, the brigand and the donkey. Mom, something needs to be done. Yes, do something ... You have to shut up. My dog ​​is destiny! I have news first and I can't send it to the newspaper. Do you want them to kill my father right away ? Exactly, I can't do it. We cannot speak, remember the fact of Baron Cosimo who was kidnapped last year? The grandchildren leaked something to the police and the next day they were heirs of 200 million. The poor fellow had been killed, you understand? Those poor things were left without their uncle. Unfortunates! - Unfortunate, but not too bad. 200 million ... - But ... - Alberto!

It's been 3 days since the ransom was paid - and your father still doesn't come back. - What are you going to do ? You have to get in touch with the bandit - and offer him an interview with my newspaper. - '' My newspaper! '' I thought you wanted to do something for my sake instead think of the newspaper. And isn't it for your sake? If they kick me out of the newspaper, how do we get married? I would like to say to this Ignatius: '' In exchange for the publicity, you immediately release the prisoner free - because he has to become my father-in-law. '' - Wait. - What's up ? Look here. - Now I understand everything. - What is this stuff? Bravo, dad! Nice Shot ! - But no ! - Yup ! - Then nothing is true. - Yeah! Poor dad! Prisoner in here all my life. Mum is not easy-going and now he's taken his vacation. Now I understand the beauty institute in Rome. - Luckily ! Fortunately, I didn't send the news to the paper. - Alberto, do you know what we do? - Thing ? Let's go to Rome to '' fish out '' the parent. He's like a child, I wouldn't want any big trouble to happen to him. In Rome alone? Me and you ? Yes, isn't that enough? If you look at another woman, I ... I meant that you and I, alone in Rome ... - Seems a little ... - Are you afraid of me? - No, but people ... - The important thing is to have a clear conscience. If we are to have a clear conscience , it is useless to go there. - Go make that four-wheeled grinder . - Yes, sir ! I tell Mom that I'm going to Aunt Clementina in San Biagio.

You always say: '' barber, barber ''. You think it's a profession ... Let me continue! Believe it is a profession to be neglected. - And no ! - It's a job! No, we are missionaries. It is a mission of civilization, of cleansing. But which missionaries? But what cleaning? And then do me a courtesy, don't call me tu, it bothers me. How should I talk to you? With you, with you, with her? When we are alone you can call me you, but in front of people ... - But now we're alone. - But someone can pass. - Ah!

Why do you tell me so many lies? - Why have you been to that place of perdition? - To help dad! Nice way to help! The good girl, the scholar! The one who sleeps with the history books under her pillow. - There comes a time when one wakes up. - Ah, did you wake up? Now I'll fall asleep again!

I can't see you because my vision is blurred. During my sufferings, I always had you in front of my eyes. Otherwise it would not have been suffering! - Meanwhile I have been anxious. - Really ? Brava! - Why did you go to Anzio? - Anzio? - You said you went to Anzio. - I said I've been anxious. - Ah, anxiety. - Yes. - Here, sir. - The water ! - Drink. - Where is it ? - Stay here. - Where are you ? - Here she is. - Where are you ? - Stay there! - Where did you put it? - Stay here. - Don't play these tricks on me! - Do not take advantage that I do not see. - Don't take advantage! - Where is it ? - Don't take advantage, drink! - Blessed water! - Benedetta. - Give drink to the thirsty. - Yes. The first thing. - Where's the mouth? I can not find it. - Stay here! Drink. - Yes, yes ! - My mouth is dry. - Really ? - My mouth is dry. - Teresa, I'm annoyed. - You should see me. - The mouth. Rosina, here. - Go. Why did they leave you? - I fled. - Ah, you ran away. - I finally got away. - Look how they made me. - I see it, a sorry state. Petty that I am! They kept me locked up in a cave. In a dark and fasting cave. - On bread and water. - Sparkling water ! - No, what are you saying? - The one who sends corks up in the air. - No, it was well water. - What stinks well water! - Stink. It was soft water and hard bread. A sometimes hard water and soak the bread. - What is hard water? - I don't know, it's water they have. - It's bandit water. - Ah, I understand. And sometimes they even gave me a few leaves to eat. - You ate the leaves. - Sunday. - Ah, like the dessert. - Hard water, soft bread and leaves. - Yup. - We ate these leaves and then we danced. - Dance the tarantella. - I was a guest, could I say that I didn't want to dance? - Sure ! - With hot irons behind them they said to me : '' Dance! '' - And you danced. - And you were dancing! - I used to do ballet. - I get it. - I do not understand you ! - What's up ? The bandit said to me: '' I don't understand you! '' Because sometimes in delirium, in the tortures they did me, - I spoke French. - But you never spoke French. One in delirium, even speaks dead tongues. - But what are these signs? - What signs? The bandit chief said it because when he didn't understand dead languages, I made the signs with my '' live '' hands to make myself understood. And then I passed out. Don't ask me anything anymore, I don't remember anything anymore. - The unconscious is amoeba. - Of course. - You don't want to talk, you don't remember anything. - Aren't you going to tell me anything? I've been through all these troubles, this ODYSSEE of mine, and you ... Hug me, tell me something, encourage me, lift me up! - Pick me up, do you see I'm down? - I hug you, I kiss you. - I finally see you here safe and sound , my husband! - Oh! - My husband! - Oh! - You are a villain! You are a thief! - Teresa! - A thief ! For 25 years you sat at my table and ate a lot! I am rich and you are poor, I married you and you didn't have a penny! You didn't have a shirt on! - And now I have it? - No, you have the shirts I made for you! - The front piece! - Every 15 days a shirt. And this wretch gave you a clean shirt every 15 days. I gave you all the whims! You got all the things you wanted. Mamma Mia ! I would give myself so many slaps! So many slaps I would give myself! Ah ! Holy shit! This slaps in the third person! - Pope ! - Tell me. - Mom knows everything. - No ! - Yes. - Why didn't you tell me earlier? I have been trying to make you understand it for half an hour without succeeding. - But what happened to you? - I don't know, I don't understand anything anymore. I said a lot of nonsense to your mother. It must be stopped. - That comes here to kidnap. - Who ? - The barber ! - The barber again? - Peppino. - Dad, I don't understand anything anymore! I don't understand anything anymore either, but we have to stop him. - I'll give him a telegram. - Yes. - Come here. - See if your mother is coming. - Yes, dad. Notify me. I make the telegram, I stop it. - You're watching ? - It's all quiet. - Everything quiet? - Did you sign me? - Dad, nothing happens! We are discovered. Second operation impossible. - Is there anyone ? - No. - Kisses, Antonio. Kisses ... Kisses? No ! I kissed him! - Hands up ! - Ah, it's you. I was going to give you the telegram. My witch wife found out everything. - Don't come home anymore. - Hands up or I'll kill you like a dog! Peppino, let's not mess with dogs, put this gun down. Take off ... - Excuse me so much! We don't know each other, do we? - No. - I am not a physiognomist. Goodbye. - Where are you going ? - I heard about the kidnapping you did in my name. - Really ? - Yup. Look how things are known, the world is so small. What's strange? Maybe you have a monopoly on kidnappings? Everyone kidnaps as he wants, we are in a democracy. You wanted 5 million for the ransom. Those 5 million were due to me, to Ignazio the Press! - Walk or I'll kill you! - Hey! At this time ? But she is tenacious! - When you put something on your head, '' it goes to the bottom ''! - Walk! - Okay, but get this thing out of my back! - Walk! There is the boss! - Shall we blind fly? What jokes are these? - Unbend it. Good morning gentlemen. Disorder perhaps? - Who are these? - My men. - Well done! All brigands. - Be careful how you talk! - I didn't mean to offend. They are all volunteer brigands . - Bring me to eat, Little One! - Here's the pasta, boss. - It's 3pm, can I wash the dishes tomorrow? - What is it? - A half-duty brigand? - Shut up ! Go ahead. Okay, you don't have to get mad. Eat, enjoy your meal. Health ! This environment is very nice, it's a bit existentialist. It is intimate. Boss, is it tightly blocked? Yup ! Are you scared of being here among us? - No, I'm used to my wife. - About your wife. - Do you know why we kidnapped you? - I believe out of sympathy. - But I don't know if there are any hidden purposes . - There is a purpose. - There is ? We now weigh you, and your wife, to get you back, you will have to pay us your weight in gold. - I'm worth as much gold as weight. - Yup. '' This time it's serious! '' '' You will pay your husband in gold. '' '' Wait for our news. Ignazio the Press. '' - Do not you believe it ? - No. He enjoys doing it now. But if he thinks I believe it again, he's wrong. - He's not that naive. - I know your father well, unfortunately. - So this time you won't do anything? - No, what can I do? But I will do something. I can not handle it anymore ! I can not handle it anymore ! You made me eat two kilos of spaghetti, three steaks, a chicken, two lovebirds, cheese and now I have to start again? - But what am I a '' sarcophagus ''? - But it's good stuff. - I know. - But I can't do it! - This bean soup with pork gravy - you have to eat it. - Pork is heavy. - Enough of these stories. - Either eat or I'll shoot! - This always shoots! - Let's change tactics, let's use good manners. - Maybe you're right. - Don't you even eat a spoonful? - No. - Come on, be good. - Look ! For your Ignazuccio. - No ! - Look. Look at the airplane, see how it flies! - Fly, fly, fly! - (TOGETHER) Ahm! - Good boy ! Now one for Guercio. - If you don't eat it, the Guercio cries. - What do we care? - What do you say ? - He's one-eyed! He cries with one eye. - No ! We play a game. - My mouth, your mouth. Which is more beautiful, mine or yours? - Mine! - (TOGETHER) Ahm! - Good boy ! Forward ! Hey! What have you got into your head? I can not handle it anymore ! Do you want me to pop? - Now I'll need at least half a kilo of baking soda. - No, it's digestive. - Exactly! - You must not digest, you must assimilate, you must gain weight. - Yeah. I forgot it. - The more kilos we weigh, the more millions we take. If my wife does not want to pay this ransom, what will you do? - Nothing ! - I say so too. Done done! If the ransom does not come on the fifth day , we cut your ear off and ship it home. Then we wait another five days and the ransom doesn't come? - We ... - The other ear. - And so ... - Piece by piece, you send me home. The idea is brilliant. Why don't you go to "First Applause"? Holy shit! - What do you need all these weapons for? - They are for killing. Already. By the way, how are you killing time in this BUGALOW? - Where is it ? - In this GOTTAGE. - So, waiting. Waiting. But you kill it badly. Do we want to kill him while having fun? - As ? - Shall we play a game of cards? - What game? - A game where you always win. All right ? - Yup. - 50 read? - 50 lire. - Dammi the mano. Where is a place ... Here it is. Sedetevi. I have food on my stomach. - Choose a card. - Yes. - Take a good look at her. - I looked at it. Put it in the deck. - Do you remember her? - Yes sure ? - Yup. - It's this one ? - Yup. Did you see her. - Now let's use my cards. - Better. Choose a card. Have you looked at it? Put it where you want. - Do you remember her? - Yup. - It's this one. - No. - How can you know if you don't look at it? - It can not be. - It's this one ? - No. - I'll tell you no. - Is that there? - No. - 200 lire. - All right. For heaven's sake, modern dances, but no! Don't you remember our dances of the past ? The tango! - The black bottom! - The hesitation! - The hi-hat! &lt;You are extraordinary! &lt;Enchanting! &lt;Looks like you're 20! &lt;(TERESA) I don't feel the years! &lt;(TERESA) Let's drink! &lt;Let's drink! &lt;(TERESA) Take a seat. &lt;(TERESA) Mr. Mayor, pour the sparkling wine. Drink, eat! &lt;How much abundance! &lt;(TERESA) Yes, there is a lot of stuff. Who is there ? - It's me ! - You ? How dare you ? What do you want ? You have to listen to me, I swear to you that ... Don't swear anything, I don't believe you anymore! Go away ! Well... If you cry, it means you need a friend. Valeria, it was all the fault of that wretched baroness. She jumped on me. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Hurray! - Hurray! - Donna Teresa, a cigarette? - Yes, I want to smoke. Yes, I smoke. - Why isn't your husband here? - My husband has fun. - And I enjoy it too. - That's right. - Rosina, put on a record. - Right away, lady. - Yes, the music. For me, music is everything. - Then why don't you swear to me? - I swore it to you thirty times! - But now let's think about your father. - Are you sure ? - Absolutely sure. And the Press is not joking. Do you want to help me? - Yes. What should we do? - Do you trust my mischief? - Not me. - Ah! - But I trust your heart. Choose a card, look at it carefully and put it in the deck. - It's this one ? - No. - Now I'll try. - It's this one ? - No. - It's this one ? - No. - Give it to me. Choose a card. Look at it well. Put it in the deck. It's this one ? RINGS OF THE PHONE Lame, is that you? Have you established contact? Well, give me the line. (IN COUNTERFEIT VOICE) Hello? Do I speak to Villa Teresa? I'd like the lady on the phone, personally. And she ? Wait a moment, sorry. Capo ! - The wife is on the phone. - My wife ! To the parlor! Where is it ? - You know what you have to say. - Yes, sir. Hello? Teresa, is that you? I am me ! Who am I ? I am your spouse! - Ah! - Do you know I weigh 70 kilos? 70 kilos of gold! They calculated 1, 000 lire per gram. Do the math. 70 kilos, 70 million for now! If you delay, fatten. They fattened me. Does the air of Rome make you fat? I too have gained weight since you left. But I don't want to get fat, so I do gymnastics in the morning. Then in the evening I play music, do some ballet, I invite someone, I do a samba, a rock and roll. But what a '' rocco and rocco ''! Teresa, here is Ignazio and he is serious! - Did you get the redemption ticket ? - Yes, I got it. I tore it up, it's in the wastepaper basket. Teresina, let me speak! If you don't hurry, one of these days you'll get an ear! - That ear is me, myself ! - Only one ear? - Why do n't you send the other one to me ? - This time it's serious. - These want the money! - Let me go now. There's the call from there, there's samba, there's rock and roll! I'm all a thrill!
