TOHO CO., LTD. DESTROY ALL MONSTERS U.N. SClENCE COMMlTTEE SPACE PORT 2 As the 20th century draws to a close, the UNSC has established a base for exploring the moon. Rockets bound for the lunar base take off daily from lwo Jima. Moonlight SY-3... ready for liftoff. Ten, nine, eight... seven, six, five, four... three, two, one, zero! Produced by TOMOYUKl TANAKA Screenplay by KAORU MABUCHl and lSHlRO HONDA Cinematography by TAllCHl KANKURA Production Design by TAKEO KlTA Music by AKlRA lFUKUBE Edited by RYOHEl FUJll Starring AKlRA KUBO YUKlKO KOBAYASHl, KYOKO Al JUN TAZAKl, YOSHlO TSUCHlYA KENJl SAHARA SUSUMU KUROBE, HlSAYA lTO YOSHlBUMl TAJlMA, NADAO KlRlNO CHOTARO TOGlN HARUO NAKAJlMA HlROSHl SEKlTA TERUO ARAGAKl SUSUMU UTSUMl KOBlTO NO MACHAN ANDREW HUGHES Special Effects Supervisor ElJl TSUBURAYA Director of Special Effects SADAMASA ARlKAWA Directed by lSHlRO HONDA The UNSC has also commenced a massive aquaculture project near the Bonin lslands. Here all manner of fish are raised. And on a nearby island lies Monsterland, a research outpost for studying the world's monsters. Godzilla... Rodan... and Anguirus can all be found here. Mothra and Gorosaurus peacefully coexist here as well. lf any of them attempts to leave, a containment system is activated. Barriers tailored to each monster's instincts and behaviors are automatically triggered. Rodan can only fly within a fixed perimeter due to a magnetic shield. Furthermore... plenty of food is produced offshore, ensuring that the monsters never go hungry. Monsterland and the aquaculture project are supervised from a command center deep underground. Yes, CHX should work fine. Everything looked good from the air. Don't the monsters look cute from up there? - They really do. - l'm relieved to hear that. l was afraid they'd scare you off. - Not at all. We need your help with an in-depth study of them. Off-planet call for Kyoko Manabe. Please proceed to booth 4. Katsuo! Where are you calling from? The moon base. This call costs a fortune! l got worried when l heard you were there. As you can see, l'm just fine. lt's not you l worried about. lt's how you'll treat Godzilla. Very funny! lt seems there's a monster here on the moon too. Really? l'm joking. Well, half joking. We're a bit concerned. l was hoping Dr. Yoshida could come. The director's in Tokyo for a conference. When he gets back - Hello? Hello? What's wrong? Hello! Power station! This is the systems operator. Power station, what's your status? What is it? We have no idea. Look! Every control system is down! This is crazy! Perform a complete systems check. - The failure analysis circuit? - lt stopped functioning! - What happened? - We don't know. - Doctor! - Gas! This way! Following the sudden loss of contact with Monsterland, the UNSC immediately launched a satellite-based investigation headed by Dr. Yoshida in Tokyo. Number 6 is now over the Bonin lslands. Good. Switch to the main screen. lt's no use. We're still being jammed. Keep trying. Don't give up. This is deliberate sabotage. Deliberate sabotage? But by whom? And why? Doctor, we got through. That's Monsterland... but l hardly recognize it. ls it a volcanic eruption? l doubt it. Zoom in closer. What's happening? This was definitely a planned attack. l doubt any of our staff survived. This is the Moscow Broadcasting System. This is an emergency broadcast. Rodan has attacked Moscow. - Rodan? At 1 1 :25 a.m. the creature appeared over the city, unleashing a torrent of destruction. lt's believed to be the same Rodan from Monsterland in the Bonin lslands. Rodan is in Moscow? What's going on? This report is coming to you from Paris. A monster has just surfaced near the Arc de Triomphe. The pride of Paris, one of the world's great treasures, is about to be destroyed. The arch is collapsing! The monster from the depths is destroying Paris. Major cities around the world are being annihilated by giant monsters. Rodan is in Moscow, Mothra is in Beijing, Manda is in London, and Baragon is in Paris. This just in: Godzilla has appeared in New York. Godzilla has turned up in New York. Doctor, how do you explain this? How did the monsters escape? Did you fail to grasp the situation in time? Gentlemen, these accusations are most unfortunate. We would never conceal information about these attacks. Dr. Yoshida? The best l can give you is a vague prediction: The monsters will continue their rampage, so we must remain prepared. Silence, please! l know nothing more at this point. l have the same questions as you... but l have no answers right now. Why hasn't Tokyo been attacked? lt's the closest city to Monsterland. l'd like to know that myself. lf anyone can explain that... please speak up. Moonlight SY-3. Moonlight SY-3! This is Moonlight SY-3, over. - Return to base. - ls something wrong? Return immediately. We'll update you then. Follow it! lt won't get away this time. But we have to get back. This is more important. That's a UFO out there. We can't risk getting any closer. What could it be? Moonlight SY-3! Moonlight SY-3, what's wrong? Damn it! We'd better get back. This seems completely backwards. What's happening on Earth? And why would they need our help? - They didn't ask for our help. - What then? You've been ordered back to Earth. We'll guide you once you enter Earth's atmosphere. You're to land at Monsterland in the Bonin lslands. Proceed directly underground. You and your ship are our only hope. And make sure you're armed. - Armed? - That's right. Proceed with caution. Roger. - Trajectory good. - Guidance beam locked on. Roger that. Stand by for reentry! Reverse thrusters, check. Commencing reentry! This is Moonlight SY-3. We've arrived at the control center's entrance. Excellent. Someone may have commandeered the center. You're to ascertain their identity and objective. Proceed with caution. They may resist. - Roger. No sign of radioactivity or sulfur dioxide. Let's go. Be careful. Look there! - Systems are up. - What's going on? Welcome back to Earth. Kyoko! Doctor! Hello again. Why are you still - l didn't expect to see you here. What's all this about, Doctor? Let's talk this over calmly. We want you, our young scientists and engineers, to understand and cooperate. Cooperate? To hell with that! You freed all the monsters while Dr. Yoshida was away. They're not actually free. We have them under remote control. Remote control? Take a look. Mothra is currently near Beijing. Godzilla is in the Pacific. Rodan is over the Urals. We can call them back here at any time. Now l'll introduce you to the creator of that control system. This way. Welcome, gentlemen. l imagine you have lots of questions. l am not your enemy. With your help... we wish to forge a new technology-based civilization on Earth. You're destroying our cities! Katsuo, why don't you hear her out? Kyoko! Before our new civilization can come to pass, certain sacrifices must be made. - What? - Where are you from? Kilaak. lt's not on Earth. There are countless asteroids between Mars and Jupiter. She's from one of them. - You believe that? - What l believe isn't important. l admire their scientific knowledge and creativity. The monster remote-control system is one example. Their technology is far superior to ours. Okada, get back! Now do you see? That shield is impenetrable. - What are you doing? - Getting you out of here. Where's everyone else? They're all well, happily at work. Call them. Don't you see? lt's no use resisting. Then we'll just take you two with us for now. We'll carry you out if we have to. Get going! lt's some kind of gas! Hurry! Stop! What are you doing? Hurry! lt's closing! Quick! Move it! Captain! Hurry! We have gas masks! Get her! Take him to the ship! Kyoko! Captain! Fall back! Captain! Let's get out of here. Did they brainwash you? ls that it? You haven't answered a single question. Listen, Otani. We can only help you if you answer us. You understand? "l don't know" won't cut it. Major cities are still being destroyed! We sent in UN troops, but the island was already deserted. Where's their new base? Please tell us. We can't continue to hide you from the UN's secret police. They don't care that we're friends. What should we do? Doctor! Don't touch him. Kyoko? So you're on the Kilaaks' side now? We've come to get you. You'll understand soon enough. Now move! - He shouldn't be moved in his condition! - You keep still. Put these handcuffs on him. The secret police! Fall back. Let's go! Stop! Scalpel. Was he hard of hearing? No. Then this isn't a hearing aid. l'm not sure what it is. Some metal l've never seen before. lt appears to have a radio receiver built in. But why would such a device be implanted in his body? Doctor... this might be how they're controlling the monsters. l agree. Dr. Otani was being controlled the same way. That's right. They tried to recover his body for fear we'd find this. They must be transmitting a signal from somewhere. lf we could intercept it, we could jam it. We'll contact the communications lab, and l'll search from the air. We're picking up an odd signal. ldentify its source! Yes, sir. lt's coming from Japan's central mountain region. Look, l'm busy. lt's an unusual rock, but l don't have time to look into it. - Yeah, but - - Officer! - There's something in the sky. - Up there! - Where? - There! - There it is! - What is it? Rodan! lt can't be. Let me see. Up there! That's the moon rocket SY-3. My son is on the moon too. Oh, that's right. How's he doing? - Fine. - Can l help you? - We're tracking down a radio signal. - Go right ahead. - Excuse us. - What's that? - Radar. Ladies and gentlemen, this may appear to be a stone, but the UNSC has confirmed that it's a monster-control device used by the Kilaaks to wreak havoc upon our world. Others like it have been discovered in the most unexpected places. The cliffs of Dover. The steeple of a church in Spain. One appeared to be a chunk of ice in an Alpine gorge. Another was discovered in a coconut on Guam. Dr. Yoshida will now explain its capabilities. This is a transceiver with a very sophisticated computer. lts estimated broadcast range is around 2,000 kilometers. The monsters are probably being controlled by similar devices in each area. As for the prisoners taken in Monsterland, they're likely in their home countries working with the Kilaaks to further the aliens' plans. We ask for your cooperation in finding them quickly. Monsterland technical team members Minoru Kudo, age 35... Tetsuo lse, age 30... Shin Kuroiwa, age 28... and Kyoko Manabe, age 23, all Japanese citizens. Michael Dawson, age 32, a British citizen, Elmer Ηughes, age 29 - Thank you, miss. Just a moment, please. - Sorry for the inconvenience. - You may go. Excuse us, miss. Thanks. You can go. Everyone take shelter! Rodan is currently circling over Sectors 7 and 8. Now it's Tokyo's turn. Evacuation is going smoothly. Yes, it is. - New target sighted. - Godzilla is in Sector 1 . What? - Manda! - Manda is attacking. Prepare to attack. All right. Open fire! l didn't expect Tokyo to remain unscathed, but Rodan, Godzilla, and Manda all at once? lndeed. New York, London, Moscow - so far it's been one monster per city. Emergency update! Mothra has appeared in Sector 5. JOlNT DEFENSE COMMAND LlAlSON CENTER We really got hit hard. Tokyo is in ruins. There were four monsters. But the Kilaaks are more interested in the lzu peninsula. lzu? All the hot springs there have stopped flowing. Just like the disturbance at Monsterland. Any proof the Kilaaks are behind this? A monster emerged from underground in Amagi. Baragon? Why were other major cities attacked first and Tokyo left for last? They were diverting our attention from Japan while they set up base under lzu. l see. And now they're using a new control system. That's right. We must determine their exact location. l want you to use the SY-3's ground-penetrating radar to probe underground. Find a breach we can use to launch an attack. Good to see you again. Thank you, Doctor. Good to see you. lt's Kyoko Manabe! - Why are you here? - Let's speak in private. No, l want to speak to all of you right here. l know what you have to say. l've heard it all before! lt may not interest you, but the others must hear this... especially the press. Where have you come from? The base in lzu. What base is that? A base the Kilaaks established to gain a foothold on Earth. And you're here as their messenger? Yes. lf you allow them to remain here and negotiate for peace and prosperity for both our peoples, they'll return the monsters to Monsterland. And if we don't, they'll have the monsters destroy us? That's not negotiation. lt's blackmail! l'm speaking to the others. You be quiet. Come here. What are you doing? Hold still! You're under their control! Hold still! Doctor! She was being controlled with these. They killed Dr. Otani and controlled the monsters and Monsterland's team with similar devices. lt's a different transceiver model. We'll look into this immediately. Kyoko, wake up! You've come to. lt's me. Let's get you to a doctor. lt's all right. Miss Manabe, this is urgent. You must tell us about the Kilaaks' base. The Kilaaks? That's right. We know it's in lzu, but where? l... The poison gas! She doesn't remember being under their control. Let's proceed. Entering target zone 1 ! Ground troops in position! Okay. Prepare to attack. Here we go, men! - SY-3 has begun its descent! - Good. Godzilla's in our landing zone! Halt descent! Emergency ascent! Steady, men... Open fire! - What's going on? - We're being jammed! lt's Anguirus! What? Damn it! Halt all operations! Damn it! Back to base. Damn Kilaaks! They outwitted us again. - Should we follow it? - Yeah. - lt's descending near Mount Fuji. - Might be a Kilaak ship. Pinpoint its landing zone. Rodan at seven o'clock! Captain, let's fight. To hell with evasive tactics. lt's not time yet. lt won't enter the airless void of space. Prepare for escape velocity! Main engine, maximum thrust! l could have done without a Rodan escort. Damn monster made us lose that ship. But we have a rough idea now. l bet we'll find the entrance to the Kilaaks' base on Mount Fuji's western slope. - Advance! - Continue advancing! Third platoon, continue advancing! Godzilla! Spread out! Fan out! First platoon, take the left road! Second platoon, head right! Third platoon, follow second platoon! This way! What's wrong? Get up! You guys all right? We're okay. Let's go. - Looks pretty deep. - Let's take a look. Damn it! lt won't budge. Must be a Kilaak cave. We have only one choice now. All right. - Get back. l'm gonna shoot. - lt's no use. Greetings. Nice to see you again, Mr. Yamabe. Welcome, Major Tada... of Defense Command. We summoned you here today on important business. Summoned us? l knew it! They've been busy, all right. That's it! Yes, that was our spaceship you saw on the moon. Now do you believe we're aliens? What's the important business you mentioned? - A declaration. - A declaration? Please listen carefully. Especially you, Major Tada. Earth does not belong to humans alone. This area beneath the Mount Fuji volcanic chain now belongs to the Kilaaks. Any attempt to retake it will be met by force of arms. What? Damn them! - Let's get out of here. - Okay. Meanwhile, on Monsterland in the Bonin lslands, the control center was back online. The team there was busy analyzing the monster-control devices gathered from around the world. So it's the moon after all! That's the true source of the signal! We'll send SY-3 to the moon. Don't land! And don't take off your spacesuits until you deal with the Kilaaks. Proceed to target. Roger that. Check your map. Target coordinates are as follows. 41 degrees north, 4 degrees west. The Cassini crater, south of the Vallis Alpes. Watch out for UFOs, and approach from a low altitude. We're on our way. Our approach vector is 45 degrees to port... from Mare Tranquillitatis to Mare Vaporum. Then down the west side of Montes Apenninus and north from Palus Putredinis will bring us to the Cassini crater. Roger. UFO at five o'clock! - They're onto us? - l'd be surprised if they weren't. What now? Do we do this or turn around? As they say, it's now or never. Okay, let's do this. We'll either be heroes or in body bags within the hour. One minute to target! Cut the thrust. Prepare to descend. Here we go. Descend! Descending! Cut the engines. Prepare the rover. Close fuel valves! Activate cooling system! Temperature still climbing! Quick! - Coolant pressure? - At max! - At max? - Yes, sir! What's going on? lt's no use. Fuel temperature is near critical! Do we abort? - No time. We'll attack from the rover! Halt! Prepare to fire maser cannon! Maser cannon, ready to fire! Fire! Commander. SY-3 is engaging the enemy. Flashes have been detected in Cassini. l want a full report from the moon base. l hope they can pull it off. Outcome is still unknown! l'll report again when they return alive. - Moon base, over. - lgnore it! lf they fail, we'll be the next to die. We and this entire base may be vaporized before long. Let's relax and have some coffee. Everyone out. Okada, Yoshikawa, Arima, come with me. Fujita and Tani, stand by. Come on. Arima and Yoshikawa, inspect the equipment. Remove and disable critical components. - Yes, sir. l didn't expect the maser cannon to be this effective. Even the most advanced technology has a vulnerable spot. Look! Those are the Kilaaks. They can only survive in high temperatures. Once we destroyed their shield, the temperature dropped. - Are they dead? - l'm not sure. Captain! Let's take them with us. The control system core. Damn thing's still running. We'll dismantle it and take it back to Earth. Moon base? - No answer? - Nothing. No answer, and the control signal is still online. So the mission failed? Do you think they failed? No good. We have one more option. Detach the maser drill! What's going on? Detach the maser drill. Get a high-voltage cable! Okay. Let's open it. Screwdriver. Okay. Let's go! Hurry! Given how long it's been since those flashes were observed on the moon... we can only assume they failed. Switch it on! - What happened? - The power source overheated! Turn it back on! And boost the voltage! We're stuck here if it blows! Forget about that! Do it! Yes, sir! They did it! The Kilaaks' signal went dead. Quick! We must regain control of the monsters. Hurry! The Kilaaks on Earth won't take this sitting down! ls it still alive? Yes, it is. But it needs a temperature in the thousands to become active again. - So it's a kind of living metal? - Yes. That explains why they were after the Mount Fuji volcanic chain. Their technology far surpasses ours, but they're very few in number. lt must take thousands of years for each one to develop this far. Thousands of years? They live that long? Yes. At constant high temperatures, they can probably live forever. - Forever? - That's right. But at low temperatures, they revert to this state. Now we know how to attack them. Massive use of cryogenic beams. Major Tada, draw up a plan. - Godzilla! - Again? So that's where you went. Excellent work. Sir, there's no time for that now! Godzilla's back! Are you sure? Godzilla's there in Tokyo? Yes. l see. We already tested our new control system on him. So he's back in Japan? So you mean...? The monsters are on our side now. They'll obey our commands. We'll direct them to Mount Fuji to destroy the Kilaaks' base! There isn't a cloud over Mount Fuji today. The mountain and surrounding Aokigahara forest are silent. But the monsters will soon launch an all-out assault on the Kilaaks' base. This is the calm before the storm. Defense forces are in position. Still no sign of the monsters. Who will arrive first? Godzilla? Rodan? Anguirus? No sign of any of them. Wait, there's something! ls that Godzilla off in the distance? No, it's Minilla. Minilla's the first to arrive. Just behind him is Godzilla, the king of monsters. And there's Mothra... right on Godzilla's heels. Next to arrive is Anguirus. Approaching from the west, he's quite a sight to see. Following Anguirus are Manda, Baragon... and Gorosaurus. Kumonga's here too. They're all advancing toward the Kilaaks' base. And there's Rodan... flying over Lake Motosu. Ηe's now over Lake Kawaguchi. He's landing near Godzilla and Mothra. Will Godzilla lead the opening charge? lt seems he's deciding where to attack. Still no sign of movement from the Kilaaks' underground lair. This monster force with Godzilla at its head is a sight to see! UFO approaching. What? lt's King Ghidorah! He's no Earth monster. The Kilaaks summoned him. We can't control him. What do we do? We'll have Godzilla and the other Earth monsters fight him together. King Ghidorah is a monster from outer space. Earth's monsters are no match for him. We await further word when you're prepared to talk. Damn them! lt's King Ghidorah, the space monster. Ηe's taking aim at the Earth monsters. The monsters are ready. King Ghidorah is swooping down! lt's a battle to the death! Hear for yourselves the cries of these terrible monsters! A flaming monster is flying south toward lzu. A flaming monster? l've never heard of such a thing! How can anything burn like that and still be alive? lt's heading straight for us! Evacuate! The Kilaaks are signaling us! Fire Dragon destroyed Dr. Yoshida's control system. Further resistance will only result in greater losses on your part. What now? Do we attack? Fire Dragon can reduce Tokyo to ashes in just a few hours. lt's Godzilla! Godzilla found the Kilaaks' underground lair. The monsters are storming the enemy. They're still fighting, even without the control system. They instinctively know their true enemy. The Kilaaks didn't see that coming! Leave here... now! Godzilla saved the day! lt's too soon to celebrate. Fire Dragon's heading back our way. We'll intercept him in the SY-3! Katsuo! Fire Dragon at eleven o'clock! Prepare to fire cryogenic missile! Fire! The targeting system's down! lt's being jammed. Switch to manual targeting. Blast it when you have a clear shot! Ready to fire! Firing! We'll shake it off! Look! A Kilaak ship! l get it now! Fire Dragon was just a drone! We're not being jammed anymore. Do we fire? Yes. Fire! - We did it! - Captain! THE END
