Okay, everybody. It's 6:00. Let's close it up. Come on. Come on, you guys. That's it for the day. You can play tomorrow, okay? - Last shot, Claude. - Come on! Hey, what do you think you're doing? - Bobby. Come on. - Just taking a beer break, man. - I'm working up an appetite for dinner. - Put the records away. - I don't want a happy hour here. - Hey, I paid a buck for that! - I wonder how far you got. - Well, he... - So, what happened? - Anyways, his mom walks in. - You were still loaded? - We were both stoned out of our minds. Anyways, his mom walks in, and she's giving me the evil eye, you know. And I realize my shirt's unbuttoned down to here. - Down to where? - Sex pervert! I just wanted a little closer look. He does that so people won't know he's queer. Yeah, believe it. Carl, my brother can get us some tickets... ...to that KISS concert. - Really? Where? - Middleton, man. - KISS? - Come on. - Eat it, man. KISS... Simmons, man. I like to see him barf up that blood. You think that stuff is real, man? No, but it ain't costing me nothing, anyway. My brother's paying for the tickets. - I see. Check you later. - See you later. Hey, I think Alan has a crush on Lisa. - Is that why she's so flat? - Every chick in there is flat. Hey, what about that chick Shelly, man? - She's sleazy-looking. - Gee, whatever you say, man. Hey, there goes Cory. Now, that is what I call a fox. She's too stuck-up. She thinks she's so bad. Why doesn't she ever hang around the rec, huh? - Maybe she has better things to do, okay? - Like get stoned 24 hours a day. Now, that sounds good to me. I heard she ran off with a rock group last year. Oh, yeah. I heard she was going with one of those guys. What? I heard she was going with all them guys. How do you know, man? You never even talk to the girl. She's too stoned to talk to, man. You can't talk to that girl. Hey, I'll see you guys later. Stuffed peppers tonight. We don't wanna miss that, do we, Johnny? Did I ever tell you about the time I broke into a bike shop? - About 10 times. - They told my mother to sign this thing... ...saying I was "incorrectable." - Incorrigible. That's right. Cops! Cops, man! You better get in the bushes! What are we doing here, man? Hell, it's Doberman. When you two get through making out in there, I'd like to talk to you. Go ahead. You two got any special reason to be hiding there? Yeah. We heard you were horny, man. I lost a contact lens in there. Oh. Come here. Let me see. You don't wear contacts. - I lost both of them. - Yeah. All right, let's go. Assume the position. Get your hands up there. What the hell you looking at? Spread them out. - How big is this blade, White? - Three inches. Almost as big as your dick. Watch your mouth, kid. If this blade was any longer, you'd do time. If it was any smaller, you wouldn't have found it. All right, let's go. - Told you he was horny. - Get in there, Carl. - Let's go. - We didn't do nothing, man. Get off of me. - Jerry, what's the good word? - Would you believe "Houston"? - They're coming? - Day after tomorrow. Mr. Sloan himself. - That's great. That's great. - It's hot in here. Let's step outside. The damn air conditioning's broke. Jerry, can I sell you a new Cadillac... ...just to celebrate? - No way, Freddy. They're gonna have to bury me in that old heap of mine. Boy, I wish I had 10 of these. You sure take care of that car, Jerry, I'll tell you. You two got enough cards on you to play solitaire. "Breaking and entering." That's pretty. I didn't take nothing, and you know it. Lighten up. If I wanna know anything on you... ...all I gotta do is look in the record. - If you can't find it, you can make it up. Where'd you get that belt buckle? - A friend gave it to me. - What is it? - It's a leaf. - What kind? Poison ivy, I guess. Your record's not that bad, Carl. I'd like to see you keep it that way. - Claude Zachary. - Who's that? The one who gave it to me. He gave me the belt buckle. - Those two boys you saw running... - Do we look like cops? - You look like jerks. Shut up. - How about it, Carl? Well, I only saw one of them. He was carrying a gun or something. A BB gun. The one that knocked me down. I don't know his name. - Call his father. - I think I saw him once at Sweetwater. Right. I'll be with you in a minute. I got some business. Yes. What did he do? A switchblade? I'll be right down. No, officer, thank you. Right. Bye-bye. Wanna go for a ride in it sometime? - Fred, everything all right? - Just some things about parking tickets. I told my wife, putting them in the glove compartment's... ...not the same as paying them. Cindy, will you please close up? I'll see you later, Jerry. Well, how about it, kid? You know, you could really use a break. Why don't you give me a name? You guys got a lot of laws, right? Well, let me tell you something. I only got one law. A kid who tells on another kid... ...is a dead kid. Well, that's a good rule, kid. - It'll serve you well in jail someday. - Damn straight. Richie, I'm writing you up for illegal weapons concealment. - You do that, wimp. - Come on, tough guy, let's go. Get your hands off me, you pinhead. I don't know about you, Carl. You live in a good place. Your dad's got a good business with the Caddies there. You're getting to be more of a punk every day, you know that? Let me ask you, you got some need to louse things up for yourself? I've got a driving need to be left alone, okay? Maybe you could use a weekend on the hill. You know, away from your friends. You're almost 15, right? The fun only lasts for another year, kid. When you're 16, you start playing for real. Well, did they at least read you your rights? What rights? You kidding me? I'd like to see them go after some real criminals sometime. Yeah. Me too. - So, what was it? - Nothing. Nothing, Ma. Come on, honey. They told me something about a knife. You must mean the nail file. Oh, yeah. We didn't do anything. God. Except that your friend had a switchblade knife on him. It was only a pocketknife. If Sergeant Doberman didn't find it... ...we wouldn't be having this discussion right now. Maybe. Look, no one's blaming you... ...but you gotta understand that Richie White is nothing but trouble, period. I heard he had to leave the last town he lived in. And living here is his punishment. Carl, I'm sick and tired of you complaining about New Granada. Now, let's just cool it. I don't wanna make your mother more upset than she is. - Did you get arrested? - Yeah. Wow. Hey, Mom, Richie got arrested. Yeah, I know. I busted their skulls, those pigs. Carl. Hi. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Come on, what's wrong? Honey, we just came from the police station. Carl was with that kid, Richie White. Richie had a knife on him. They got arrested. I went to the station and rescued him. - You should have called me. - I was there at the agency. Jerry Cole was right next to me. I had to make up some excuse about parking tickets you're supposed to have. You weren't too hard on Carl, were you, dear? I broke his legs. Didn't you see him crawl? Come on. Same old dumb thing. They wanted Perry and this other chump... ...and they thought it was us. - We should've stayed on the sidewalk. Doberman would've grabbed us anyway. Man, this town's one big bust. You could get sent to the hill for just walking down the street. Won't send me to the hill no more. I'm an outlaw, Jack. Them cops want to deal with me, they'd best do it on the street. - Hey, man, you ready for this test? - I'm better than ready, man. - I just did some speed at breakfast. - All right. Okay, you guys. Now, instead of the identification test I told you all about... ...l'm going to do something different. I'm going to put one slide on the screen of one painting. I want you all to write a short essay about it and tell me what you see. Okay, cool it. Marcy? Marcy? Marcy. Marcy? Marcy! If I can interrupt you and Lisa for a moment and have you turn the lights off, please. What? That stuff I took. It was supposed to be speed, but I think it was acid. - I'm flashing. - Really? Oh, my God. Good morning. I want to talk to you all this morning about a shocking incident... ...which occurred yesterday when some students... ...who might possibly even go to this school... ...caused a major traffic accident on the freeway. Because of this, the school board has decided on the following steps... ...to stop this kind of thing from going any further. Smoking on or near school grounds will result in immediate suspension. Mr. White, you're late. Why are you late, Richard? I had to take a piss. What? - I mean, I had to urinate. - Sit down. Now, there will be a 9:30 curfew starting tonight... ...and it will be strictly enforced by the police department. I hope that's clear. We have a film that we would like you to see, and then Mr. Cole... ...who is president of the homeowner's association... ...has a few announcements. Vandalism is one of our country's biggest problems today. Estimates for destruction to school facilities alone... ... is over $ 100 million per year. And counting all acts of vandalism to public and private property... ... some experts push the figure to over $ 1 billion every year. A "vandal" is defined as one who willfully... ... wantonly, and ignorantly damages... ... and destroys valuable or beautiful things. Oh, no. So destructive. Look. Maybe you're mad at the school, but busting something doesn't help. I just think it's childish. I don't know. Sometimes I think they're really like a herd of baboons. It's all right. It's okay. - What time will they be here? - We meet at the Four Winds at 1:30. About noon, then, here for drinks? Yeah, 12:00 is fine. Jerry's stopping by tonight to check over the plans... ...so make some hors d'oeuvres and crap. We've gotta give these guys a feeling for what it's like to live here. Dad, are the guys from Texas coming to buy the land across from the rec? - They're coming to look at it. - What for? It's an industrial park. They'll lease out parts of the land to various companies. I thought they were building a drive-in and a bowling alley. Carl, things didn't turn out the way we thought, okay? And the city's gotta make money on that property. Besides, we need more of a reason for people to move here than the bowling alley. See you about 9, Carl? Okay, Mom. The park's for wimps. And there's so much to do around here, man. At the park we can watch Carl try to pick up Cory. Will you lay off? At least I have a chance with her. She wouldn't even look at you. That girl was so ripped today it was ridiculous. Don't talk to me about being ripped. - Hey, anybody getting off? - Hey, Richie. It's all right, man. - Hey, Tip. - Hey, Claude. - How's it going? - Pretty good. Just getting mellow. - Got some hash. - Excellent. How much? - Twelve bucks a gram. - That's pretty steep, don't you think? It's good stuff. All right. I'll take it. I know where I can score on some good acid too. No, thanks. No more acid for me. Okay. So they asked my mother to sign this thing... ...saying I was "incorridable" or whatever. - Incorrigible. Yeah, whatever. She wouldn't do it. You know, she won't sign that bunk shit. Hi. You know, Cory could be here, and you might not even know it. - Shut up, man. - Hey. Just circulate around. Just, you know... Just circulate around. You might find her. - I did not, Jeff. - Jenny, did you see Cory around? - We each did about two ludes. - They were rainbows. Rainbows are ludes. Get me some beer, man. We need some beer, man. We need beer. - Carl, what's going on? You want a hit? - No. You couldn't find Cory? She's a waste of time. She is. Hey, boys. Just heard me about a party. - Where? - Over at old town. - Come on. - Come on, let's go. - Come on, where you guys going? - Party. Come on. - Richie? - Richie! - Come on in! - You got a light on you? - Come on. - Hey. Hey, man, what's going on? How's it going? All right. Hey, Carl, my man. - How'd you hear about my party? - Word just got around. Yeah, word just gets around. I mean, is this a party or not? - Go get yourself a beer. - Hey, where are your parents, anyway? Reno. Hey, what's going on, Carl? Having a good time? Yeah. How about a hit, man? Thanks for getting me busted. That's okay. Long as you didn't mention my name to the cops. No, I don't think your name popped up. Because if I ever found out you mentioned my name to a cop... ...you'd be eating lunch through a tube. Yeah. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. You. And? You could do a lot better. - Here, man, knock yourself out. - Thanks a lot, man. Where you going, man? I'm leaving, man. There's nothing happening here. Not for you? Yeah. What could I do? - What's wrong? - Nothing, man. Did I ever tell you about the time I broke into a bike shop? Don't worry about it. They can't... They can't... Okay, party's over. It's 9: 15, and anybody who's not in their own home in 15 minutes... ... is in violation of curfew. Wait a minute, you can't come in here! This is private property. My father's a lawyer. I know my rights. I don't care who your father is. Fifteen minutes. See if he's got any money. You just remember to keep your mouth shut, faggot. Now, you take your boy. I mean, he's intelligent. He's a good kid. Now, where does that come from? I mean, he's not born decent. Nobody's born... Hey, Carl. - We're just talking about you... - Carl, come back here. - My God. - Carl. Son, are you all right? - I got in a fight. - You got in a fight? - Who did this? - Don't touch it. - Who did this? - I don't know. - It was dark. I didn't see them. - Fred, I will handle it. Fred! Freddy, come on. Let Sandra take care of it. - That's what mothers are for. - He's bloodied up. - He's all beat to hell. - Don't get in an uproar. Come on, come on. Sit down. I don't know what the hell's gotten into him this past year. He's into that recreation center gang over his head. I've talked to him about those kids. "Stay away from them." - He wants to be part of the gang. - It's peer pressure. Peer pressure. It's powerful stuff, even when we were kids. - Well, maybe you're right. - I know I'm right. We ought to make sure that none of those kids are hanging around... ...when Sloan and his people arrive tomorrow. Maybe we ought to just shut the rec center down for the day. Who did you fight with? Two guys jumped me. - Do you know who they were? - No. - I'm okay. - Hey, come on, honey. - Does it hurt? - Yeah. Do you want to see the doctor in the morning? No. He'll pour a bottle of peroxide on my head. I'm not gonna be scarred for life, Mom. Sandy! Did they take any money? Four bucks. Here's five. It's combat pay. Thanks. Carl... ...go a little easier on your father, will you, honey? He's under a lot of pressure lately. Okay. Good. - Good night. - Good night. I guess they thought it was his girl... Oh, boy, he got me... I'll tell you one thing, Jerry. I sure do appreciate the use of this here buggy. Just a little New Granada hospitality. Fred Willat owns the local dealership here, Mr. Sloan... Now, Jerry, you just call me Roy. Jerry Cole takes care of that. I've got enough trouble... ...taking care of the Cadillac agency, you know? But like I said, it is a little slow right now. We're in what we refer to as hiatus. - The hiatus. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. Hey, Carl. - Carl, come on. - I like it. I like it. Who does your face these days? - Jesus, Carl, what happened to you? - I got jumped. - Are you okay? - I'm all right. Who beat you up? He did a great job. - Never mind. - Was it the disgusting people... ...from Planet Pork? He's a fox. Who nailed you, man? Mark Perry and that gorilla he hangs out with. Yeah? Your parents blow up on you? No, not really. Hang in there, man. Thanks. - Man, are you all right? - I'm all right. What are you, into brass knuckles and baseball bats? - I didn't volunteer for this, man. - It's okay, man. You look like a fighter. It's open. - Anything wrong, officer? - Not with me. Why are you hanging around? Just wanna make the kids paranoid? Spoke to Jerry Cole. Said he'd talk to you... ...about shutting down today? - I told him, and I'm telling you now: The rec stays open. It's the only place these kids can go. - That's a little more important... - Heard there was hash being sold here. - No chance that would happen here? - No chance. Look, you know these kids can't bring drugs to the rec. All the old familiar faces. You are violating a city ordinance coming in here. Whose permission do I need? Ours, faggot. You don't belong here. Now, let's just make him feel at home. Okay, let's just all mellow out, okay? How you doing, flower child? - Hit it. - Hey, what do you think you're doing? - Where's your warrant, pig? - You need a warrant to search us. - We got rights. - Just because we're kids... ...you can't push us around. - Why don't you go to hell too? Lincoln, I made a narcotics seizure. Request assistance. I could search every one of you if I wanted to. Search me, then. Come on. Search me! Okay, Carl. Would you like to see my pockets, officer, sir? Dangerous weapon, huh? Rec's closed for the rest of the day. Everybody out! Tell them. Get off that car! White! Off that car! - What's going on over there? - Looks like the kids... The kids must be having some kind of fun over there. It's a fun day. You see, Sergeant Doberman... That's our local police officer. He's involved in youth work. Snap out of it, man. Come on. Claude's just another lost cause. Hey, ain't that your old man up there? That's him. I'll bet he had that dog bust the rec on purpose... ...so we wouldn't be here when those turkeys showed up. Who the hell are they? Texas millionaires, man. They're gonna build an industrial park. Texas? All they got in Texas is steers and queers. Hey, Johnny, come on. Take a walk with me and Carl. Come on, Johnny, man, don't worry about it. It's just as well you couldn't tell that pig what you thought of him. He would have busted your ass too. - You know that kid Stuart Hatner? - Yeah. What about him? - His father got him a brand-new car. - No kidding. What kind? - Dodge Charger. - Does he let him drive it, or what? Yeah, but his father has to come along with him when he drives. - Big deal. Who cares, man. - It's still his car. Must have a great time on dates with his father along. What the hell is this sh... - Happy Fourth of July, man. - What am I gonna do with firecrackers? Give them to Claude. Let him smoke them. If I got a job, I bet you I'd get me one of them nice Kawasaki 350s. - All I want me is one of those big BMWs. - What would you do, ride under it? Hey, there's your wench, man. Let's go. - May I see your driver's license, please? - Jesus. Hi. You know, that breaking-and-entering stuff is against the law. Get lost, retard. Too bad your friends weren't home. - What friends? - Your friends there. Yeah, they could've at least left the front door open for you. - Hey, what happened to you? - Nothing. I thought maybe Mark messed you up after the party. - I didn't get hurt. - Didn't get helped, either. See you, Cory. I'm going home. - Hey, what are you doing? - Give it back, damn it. - Not bad. - Wow. Why don't you wave it around on the streets so everybody can see it. - Give it back, Richie. It's ours. - I just want to check it out. - Yeah, we'll walk you home. - I'm not walking home. She's surfing. Hey, Richie. Who was that guy you told me about for guns and stuff? - What are you talking about? - Oh, yeah. Listen, I got this friend. You get this guy on the right day... ...he might give you 150 bucks for one of these things. - Maybe throw in a couple of Thai sticks. - Oh, yeah? Think we could sell it? Maybe. Hey, you know, me and Richie have our own condo over there. Yeah, I'll bet you just got married. - Check this place out. - Hey, this is neat. I don't think they're gonna finish it. I haven't seen anybody around here in a long time. My father says they're out of money. Yeah. Who'd want to live here, anyways? Have a seat. Hey, where'd you get this box? It was some robbery scheme I planned up. Worked out pretty decent. Was that before or after you broke into a bike shop? Shut up. Anybody wanna get high? I knew it, out pops a number. Whose house is this where you got this gun? We don't know. - You just found it, huh? - Yeah. - Lucky you. - Yeah. Hey, you really think we can get 150 for it? - Easy. - I want to shoot it first. - We got some shells with it. - They had some grass too... ...but we didn't take that. - No. We dumped it all over the rug. - Get lost. - Come on, you little prude. Hey, what does "European Living" mean? It means it's always gonna look bombed out like this. How'd you like to go on a date sometime? I don't go out on dates. Well, what do you do, then? Just see my friends. I just mean I like you. I like you too. You have pretty eyelashes. Yo... ...what say we go to the fields tomorrow, for target practice? - Have a Sunday picnic. - All right. A picnic with a gun. You alive? Carl, I'm really sorry, man. When we looked, there weren't any bullets in it. Come on. I'm late enough. My mom's gonna have a cow. - What about the gun? - Don't worry about it, baby. - It's in good hands. - Yeah, sure. - Bye, Carl. - Bye. See you later. I bet you love her now that she almost blew your brains out. Okay, okay. Damn! I admit, we've got a little juvenile trouble here, but you can't... Let me tell you something, Mr. Cole. You got more than juvenile trouble. Seems to me you all were in such a hopped-up hurry to leave the city... ...that you turned your kids into exactly what you were trying to get away from. Let's go. - That was very well-put, Roy. - I thought so. Doberman didn't even write me up. He just held me for a few hours while my mom was freaking out. He tried to scare me, you know. He thinks he's a big deal. Give him a gun, and you'd think he owned the world. Yeah, Deputy Dog makes me sick. My mom, she was busy doing some group thing, group therapy. She's weird. You wanna play basketball? No. Me, Cory, Richie and Abby, we're going out to the fields. Wanna come? Really? Cory, man, she's a waste of time. Why don't you shut up, man. I'm not trying to pick her up, okay? Listen, I'll meet you, all right? Yeah, there's so much else to do around here. Yeah, what can you do. Take it easy, huh? Yeah, I'll see you. Well, that's the old ballgame. First the kids put on that sideshow in front of Sloan, and now this. I told you we should've sent those punks out of town for the week. If I ever get my hands on the little creeps that did this... - I wanna know what the cops are doing. - What happened? They ruined your Cadillac, that's what happened. Sloan went to get in the car, whole damn thing blew up right in his face. How'd you like to live up here? It would be all right, I guess. Someday I'd like to live in a real old city, though. Yeah, I lived in Chicago for three years before we came here. I lived in New York. Cooperstown. Baseball Hall of Fame's there. There's a lot of country there too. Me and my father used to go backpacking all the time. That was before he got the dealership here. How come you moved here? Skiing. We went once, about three years ago. Shut up. Shut up! - Jerk. - Check out Dirty Harry. You couldn't hit an elephant if it came up and kissed you. Watch this, baby. Come on, it's my turn to shoot, Richie. Come on. - Hey, it's my turn. - Hey, wait. Claude didn't shoot yet. - My turn. - No, it's my turn. I only shot twice. - I haven't shot yet. - Well, God. Abby! Wait, wait. Let me give you a target. Don't get in front of Cory when she's got the gun. - Funny. - Hit this. Get out of there, man. I can't hear anything. When the cops practice, they wear those ear things. - Here, let me try it... - Wait, wait. - I haven't shot it. - Claude's gotta use it. I don't wanna use it. I told you. Just let him use it. I don't care. It's our last bullet, man. Make it count. - All right. - Great shot, man. I wouldn't wanna have you for an enemy, man. That's it for the ammo. Let's split. Hey, Claude, Abby told me you got busted yesterday. - Yeah, I did. - Doberman went right for him. - Like I had see-through pockets. - What'd you have? A little hash. - Didn't know there was any hash around. - Yeah. Tip sold me some down at the park Friday night. - That's funny. - What's funny? Well, I heard Tipper got busted. Well, he was doing business the other night. You think Tip made a deal with Doberman? Yeah, I can get a couple of keys... ...but with inflation and the dollar dropping, it could get pretty heavy. Well, if you're talking a couple of ounces, we're looking at 75 bucks a drop. Hey, if you wanna play the game, you gotta pay the price. I don't make the market. I'm on the street like everybody else. - Hey, Tip. How's it going, Tip? - Hey. I gotta go. - Hey, Tip, how's it going? - How's it going, Tip? Let's go for a walk, Tip. - I don't really think I wanna see this. - Me, either. All right, I'm hungry! I'm hungry! Where's the junk, man? How come Doberman knew you sold to Claude? - How do I know? - You're lying! Hey, my mom's over there. I'm gonna scream. I'm gonna blow you away, Tip. Hey, that's not real. You may never see anything so real. You told Doberman who you sold that hash to, didn't you? I had to. I got busted last month. I never had a chance. A kid who tells on another kid is a dead kid. Jesus Christ! For God's sake, man, put the gun away. Don't do that! Goodbye, narc. Oh, my God. What are you doing?! - Let's get out of here, man. - First let's dump this chump. - Hey, I can't swim! - Grow fins, turkey! - I'll see you in jail! - Up yours, lady! Mom! Mom! I'm drowning! I'm drowning! I'm drowning! - Hey, we get the whiskey. - No, you don't. It's ours. - Come on. - We got it. We got it first. Carl, give it back. Come on. I can see it there. Give it back. - Come on. It's all of ours, not just yours. - I gotta go, man. My mom has group tonight, and we don't wanna upset her. - See you later. - Take it easy. Come on, let's get out of here. Bye-bye. Come on. She ain't the only girl in the world. One thing led to another in front of the cop. The cop has as much brains as a damn ant. I asserted myself, and I said... ...as a salesman, I have good instincts as a salesman. I said, "Jerry, I don't think these guys from out of town... ...care about the property. They're not interested. They're in Las Vegas writing it off." You know what he says? He says, "How are the Caddies selling?" You think that I enjoyed being humiliated like that? No. Goddamn it, if he had done such a good job on those guys from Houston... ...they wouldn't have got scared. Two kids, three... I don't know how many kids, scared them out of town. I know it sounds wrong, but I'm sure Jerry knows... Jerry Cole doesn't know anything. He doesn't know a damn thing. - He's an idiot. - Carl, where have you been? I was just out. Carl. Come over here. I want to talk to you. It's okay, honey. It's okay. Sit down. What is it? I had a talk with Sergeant Doberman. I had to sit while he warned me about keeping you in line... ...or I'd find myself in juvenile court. - What? Doberman said what? - I'm not finished! I saw you at that rec yesterday when that boy was arrested. Oh, I know you did. I'll bet you and Jerry Cole... ...had Doberman bust the rec on purpose, huh? Is that what you think? Do you also think that I put that ounce of hash in Claude Zachary's pocket? - Do you? You think that too? - It wasn't an ounce, Dad. - How do you know so much about it? - Did I get busted? Oh, shit! Fred, let's just discuss this quietly. It's not necessarily Carl's fault that Claude... It's never his fault. It's always his friends' fault, right? His friends with the knives, the drugs. But those friends of yours are going to reform school, and you're not gonna follow! Who's going to reform school? Jesus Christ. Carl, we don't want you to see your friend Richie White for a while. Or Claude Zachary, either. The teen center is gonna be closed for a while... ...at least until they can find a new counselor. What's wrong with Julia? I know you like her, but it's obvious she can't control the wilder kids. Bullshit. Don't you ever talk to your mother like that again, young man, you hear me? You're crazy. - Don't leave... - Get off of me! I said, don't leave when we're talking to you! - Fred, stop that! - Goddamn it. Listen, honey... And the fern needs a lot of water... ...yet they can live together in the same environment. - Sometimes... - Stop talking! - Alan, what are you doing? - Nothing. If tomorrow were the last day of the rest of your life, would you do nothing? - I don't wanna think about that. - What do you want to think about? I don't know. Maybe just having a good time. Carl, go to the botany box. Show us an example of a succulent plant. That's right. And a fern. That's right too. Thank you, Carl. You guys may not realize it... - The boy with the gun was Richie White. - But Richie's not in this class. - That's what Tip said. - Okay, Richie had... But now, look. Anyone? Anyone at all? - Tip tell you any other names? - Claude someone. - Richie. Richie, come on. - What do you want? Come on! Richie, wait! I wanna come. Now, you go home. Be a good boy. Take care of Mommy. Okay? That's my man. Richie, why aren't you in school? I forgot my homework. I'm going right back. Don't worry. - Did you get it? - Yeah, I got these too. You're stealing your mom's car? Yeah, she only made three payments on it. The goddamn bank owns it. Okay, listen. We make it to Sweetwater... ...stash the car, we sell the gun, then we can move out. Anywhere. My mother won't rat. She won't tell the pigs. The pigs won't find out. - We're running away? - No. - Bye-bye, New Granola. - Bye. Put on some of that bad rock 'n' roll, boy! All you got is this old crap, though. It's better than nothing. Just put it on, man. All right! - Check the ashtray, man. - Why? Check it, man. My mom's secret stash. That'll last us a couple of days, boy! - Oh, it's Doberman. - Oh, no. - The gun. Ditch it. - No, I ain't... - Get rid of it! - No. - Will you get rid of the gun? - We're burning him. Just shut up. Jesus Christ! Watch it! Look out! You're veering right! Watch it! Split up, man! He can't follow both of us! Hold it! I order you to stop! - Hold it right there. - You son-of-a-bitching pig. Johnny, is that you? Do one tap for yes, two for no. Did you hear anything about Richie? What happened? He's not dead, is he? Listen, Johnny... ...you still there? Tell Claude I'm all right. I'll tell him where I am later. Listen, Johnny... ...it's gonna be all right. Maybe I'll see you soon, okay? - You made it. - Yeah. I'm sorry I'm so late. My dad was acting real suspicious. I thought he overheard when you called. I was waiting for him to fall asleep, and I fell asleep. When I heard about it, I thought about you right away. I mean, I only knew him with you. He still had the gun with him, didn't he? Yeah. I think finding that gun was an omen. So does Abby. What do you mean? Just that it's weird, us finding it... ...then running into you guys. I know. What were you gonna do? I don't remember. I told him to get rid of the gun when Doberman started chasing us... ...but he wouldn't do it. I knew it was gonna happen. The first day I ever met him he said: "Hi, I'm Richie White. I'm on probation." What are you gonna do? I don't know. I'm scared. I'll go home, I guess. But not right away. I'm glad you came. Me too. It's kind of cold in here. The sleeping bag's warm. You wanna get in? You know, someday I'm gonna be a gypsy. - A what? - Gypsy of the road. - You know, a truck driver. - Oh. You don't believe me? It was in the paper about this lady. She's only 95 pounds. She's already driven over 100,000 miles. I cut out the article. She's standing next to this giant truck and "Gypsy of the Road" is painted on it. You know, my uncle says I can be a truck driver any time I want. He's got a trucking company in Arvada. This sleeping bag's pretty big, huh? I always used to like to play in it when I was little. You know, I think you're really beautiful. You are. No, I'm not. Carl. Wake up, Carl. Are you going? Yeah. I gotta go home before my dad wakes up. It's barely even light out yet. He gets up at 6. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna go home and get some money when my mom's out. Oh, you can keep the sleeping bag. Will you call me? Yeah. Come on. - Bye. - Bye. Okay, you guys. You are to take these home to your parents. It's to let them know about a special emergency meeting. It will be here tonight in the cafetorium at 8:00... ...and it's to discuss the problems about you people. Has anyone seen Carl Willat? This is a really serious matter and his parents really are worried. If you've seen him, you've gotta be straight with me. We're only concerned about his safety. Nothing bad is going to happen to him. You little asshole! Come any closer and I'm gonna blow your eyes out. That evens it up, huh? Good shot, man. What were you aiming for, my nose? Man, you sure get your money's worth. - You live here, huh? - Practically. They suspended me. At least until my hearing, which I don't even know when it's gonna be. - Are you suspended? - No. Just ditching, huh? It's okay. Don't worry. I used to do it all the time. I heard about Richie White getting it. Doberman's out of hand. What did you get suspended for? Oh, some stupid things. Stolen goods. I bet they reduce it. Doberman wanted to put me away anyway. It's a joke, man. If I was you, I'd go home. What are they gonna do with a kiddie like you? You never did nothing. They gotta catch me first. Forget it. You won't get past Sweetwater. They'll pick you up. Believe me, I know. You don't know. All you've ever done is gone around shooting things... ...with this stupid air rifle. Don't make me mad. We'll have to start this stupid thing all over again. It ain't like that at all. Here. Hey, I think you're all right, man. Any time you want to come say hello, just leave a message with my secretary. All right? - Hello? - Has he shown up yet? No, not yet. Well, he's run away, then. That's it. He's got to come home. Where's he gonna get any money? That damn cop! He should be out looking for him... ... instead of going to that PTA meeting. Thank God we kept Carl's name out of the paper, I'll tell you. I'm losing my mind over this. I'm sorry Richie White got killed... ...but God help me, now maybe Carl will understand how serious this is. I got a chilly phone call from Mrs. Rupert this morning. They're getting that telephone tree working... ...in order to get parents to the meeting tonight. Right down to the wire for the last two days... ... of our carnival of values price-slasher sale. At Willat, we say come down with your checkbook and your good credit... ... and let's talk leases... - Anyone talk to the friends? What about...? - I bet you wish I got shot, too, huh? - Carl? - Carl! - Stay right... Sandy, you keep him there! - Carl! Carl, we're your parent... Honey, we're your parents. All we're trying to do is to protect you. Carl! Sandy! Carl, let me in here immediately! Carl! Carl, we're sorry. We all lost our heads the other night. What's Carl doing here? - Look. - That's Carl. Oh, my God. It's Carl. - Hey, Carl, what's going down? - Hey, what happened? Hi. Lincoln, the gun. I don't know what's wrong with him. Sure, Ed. The gun, Ed. The public relations, Ed. How you doing, soldier? Tonight we're here to talk about a problem that has been with New Granada... ...since its incorporation. Youth crime. That is to say, youth discipline. I think it would be a mistake for us to tell ourselves... ...that yesterday's tragic event was an isolated incident. All of us who are parents know what it's like... ...to wait up for a child who's out late, to wait for the phone to ring... ...and then when it does, to be a little afraid to answer it. - Hey, it's Claude. - Claude! Good to meet you, Claude. - Hey, man, are you all right? - Yeah. - Your parents get mad at you? - Ah, the usual. Same old thing, you know. You think Doberman will get fired? Ah, hell, fire him. They'll give him a medal. Yeah, he's gonna make a big speech tonight... ...and tell how he shot Richie in self-defense. - Yeah! - It's all a bunch of crap! - Right! - Yeah! - And all our parents are there to hear it. - And there ain't nothing we can do about it. We should go down there and tell them all to go to hell. Everybody who's ever messed with me in one room. That'd be just about everybody in town. Thank you. First of all... ...I certainly expected to see a few more people here tonight. As a matter of fact, this turnout is really pathetic. I wonder where all those parents are. What are they doing that's so important? If the death of a 14-year-old boy won't get them away from their television sets... ...for a meeting like this, I don't think anything will. It's that kind of apathy that got us into this mess in the first place... ...as I think we all know. At least, those of us who did bother to show up at this meeting tonight. Well, I guess we all realize... ...it's time for some tough talk about the kids in this city. Man, one stick of dynamite would do it. I don't know how many of us are willing to admit... ...just how deep in trouble some of the kids in this city are. I don't know how many of you know it, but right here in New Granada... ...we've got one of the highest rates of vandalism in the state. In a few moments, Sergeant Doberman is going to tell us... ...some of the recommendations of the police department... ...a few measures for dealing with the problem and preventing future tragedies. As we all know, New Granada is a... A unique place. That's why we've all chosen to live here. People don't move into a planned community... ...to be pushed around and scared to go out at night. They come here to get away from that sort of thing. And if we're asking them to move here, then we owe them that security. Now, this isn't just a New Granada problem. I've talked to city managers and councilmen and mayors all over the country... ...and heard that same stuff about the kids over and over again. So it isn't as if New Granada is some kind of a freak... ...but we are right on the firing line... ...and we've gotta meet this problem head-on. We aren't anywhere near our growth factor in our master plan this year... ...and if we don't grow, we don't succeed. Now, you think about it. Just the other day, I passed by the Supreme. I can remember when that was our finest apartment house. Three hundred units. Spacious, decorated, electric kitchens... Where you going? You leaving? What? I deeply regret what happened yesterday. No one wants to shoot a kid. This is the last thing that any police officer wants to happen to him in the line of duty. I did not come here to apologize. I am sorry. Sorry that he was carrying a handgun. Sorry that he was on drugs. Any other kids in there? There's no way for a kid on drugs to learn anything. A kid in the classroom on drugs, that classroom does not exist for him. There is no way for a kid on drugs to grow up. So I'm sorry about Richie White and his friends pushing pills and pot and angel dust. The first thing we've got to do is have an early curfew... ...and the second thing we have to do is close down the places... ...where they've been selling these drugs. And we took an important step in that direction yesterday... ...when we closed down the teen center. Sergeant, is it true that Richie White's gun wasn't loaded? - When somebody points a gun at you... - Answer the question! Was the gun loaded? Well, how the hell was I supposed to know?! I don't even think he knew! That kid was violent, wild! You never knew what he was gonna do next! - Come on. - All he did was hang around that rec center! And I think you've got some things to answer for yourself! You have contributed to the problem of these teenagers! All I have done to these teenagers is listen to them! Somebody's got a handgun... If I see a person carrying a handgun, he better have a goddamn good reason! Yeah, like you do, right? Miss Vogel, please. Now, please. Just... Everybody needs to calm down here for a minute. I know you've been under a strain, Ed. I appreciate your concern. We're all concerned here. But I think we've gotten away from the main point... ...which is that a community with a juvenile crime problem... ...is not a community with a high property value. I am interested in the health of this community. Ed, it's okay. It's okay. You can have the finest housing in the world, and we do... ...but nobody's gonna pay 80, $ 100,000 to live in a decorator-colored slum. Jerry, can I ask you a question? What the hell are you talking about? What do you mean? I'm talking about the problem. Yeah, but which problem? The problem with the kids... ...or the problem with resale values? What makes you think if you shut the rec down or you put a curfew on kids... ...the problem's gonna fly away? - Now, I know you've been upset lately. - That's right. I'm goddamn upset! My son ran away, and I don't know where he is tonight! I'm upset! Your son and some of his friends are part of this problem. Goddamn it, Jerry, my son and his friends are part of this goddamn town! And you people talk about these kids like they're animals running in the street! Have you sat down and talked to your kids? - Has anyone talked to these kids? - I talk to them! I talk to them six hours a day until I'm blue in the face! I spend more time with your kids than you people do. You think those kids are interested in learning? Come in and see what goes on in a classroom. But no, when we have open school week, nobody comes. And that includes you, Mr. Willat! Why is everybody pointing fingers at these kids? What, are they all rotten, and we're good? What is it, what's going on? - I don't think Jerry meant we don't care... - The problem is Jerry does not care! I think it's highly inappropriate for us... Eat it, you stinking pig. We've got a situation out here. Keep these people calm. People! People! People! We seem to have a situation here! Please be quiet... Get on the door. We've got a situation... Sergeant Doberman will be right back! That's your goddamn kid out there, Mr. Willat. I know the door's locked! We got a minor situation out here! All the doors are locked! Your kids have locked us in! All right, please. I know how we can handle it. You people got me acting crazy! Now, relax! It's your kids out there. They got us surrounded. We're gonna handle it. It's your fault. I don't know what the hell we were in here for. Carl! Carl! Carl! I know you're out there! Carl! Carl! You have to answer me, son! Extra, extra! Read all about it! Extra, extra! Read all about it! Kids trash the school! They've got guns! They've got guns! Sergeant! Do something! They've got guns! Hysteria isn't gonna get us out. Please be quiet! Will you please be quiet? Goddamn it, be quiet! Mother, dear, go to your bedroom. - Go. You better go. - Stop hanging out in the bathroom. Practice your piano. - You need practice on it! - Go to hell! Keep cool! Keep cool! Everybody bear with me. The situation's under control. Mr. Cole. Mr. Cole, bear with me. Everything is under control. I can assure you, everything is under control. I don't believe it, man. It's a wreck. We got them swimming in pain! Hey! Wait! Carl? Hey! Relax! Hold it. Hold it. Please relax. Bear with me! Everything's all right. Be cool, everything's all right, we'll get out of here. Johnny? Johnny! Hi. Would you do me a favor? Would you get me that phone in there? Would you dial zero? Thanks. Carl! Hey, Carl! Come grab yourself some tapes, man! I've had enough. Claude! Claude! - Hey, what happened to you? - Oh, I almost got blown up. Have you seen Carl? Not since he was with you. God, I wish I could find him. I just wanna go home. Come on. I'll take you home. You'll be okay. - Abby! - What? - Have you seen Cory? - No, I haven't seen her. I think she left. Holy Christ! I'm taking your car! I want your men to pick up every little punk on the street! Round them up and get them out! I don't care if they're 6! Ed! Ed! Damn it! Wait up, Ed! Under the circumstances, don't you think you ought to let these men handle it? Ed! Listen, in light of yesterday's tragedy, I think your presence might... You are in no fit shape to take... I see you, Carl Willat! Hold it right there! Don't be a fool like Richie. Don't make a move, don't be a fool, don't run like Richie did. Hold it right there! Don't make a move or I'll nail you. They're gonna send you up to the hill for a couple of weeks. And then you're gonna come home... ...and then it's up to you, and I hope you make the right decision. I hope you make the right choices. I really do.
