Who are you? You should know now. So, Eagle... I've spent a lot of time looking for you and then last here you are. You are lucky you didn't die last time. But now... - Go get him. - Yes, sir. What are you people want here? Sir, he... Eagle, your back. What's happening to Jade? General Long has her. Oh, come on. Hey everybody! Listen here, listen here to me! I'll give you 10 times your money. Yes, 10 times your money to anybody we just done here. You see, I'll give you 10 times your money for anyone who can... All right. I'll do it, no problem. And I'll buy you all a drink when I win. Okay friend, let's see your money and you start. And take it. Come on, hurry up get him. - Come on. - Come on. - Let's see some action. - Come on get him. Stop! He stole my money! I want to try him. Alright friend, how much money do you have? Hey, that guy must be out of his mind. Really, he's gonna lose every cent. Oh, here's your money. Here, you take it. But I can't do that. Just take it. After all, I only did it for you. Come on, have your fortune told, sir. Your fortune, sir. Oh no, thanks. Hey, fortune sir. - Welcome, sir. - Welcome. Soothsayer, tell me one thing. Do want palm reading or something else? I can do anything. Nothing like that, tell me if you've been living here a long time. Well, of course I have. Well anyone here can tell you that. I know everyone in the entire region. So, I see. You're a stranger here. That's right. I'm here to look for one particular person. Well then, tell me who is that person? General Long. General Long? He was a Manchurian warrior and then a General. Where is he now then? Well. It's a long way from here, are you sure you wanna go? Just tell me. General Long lives behind that mountain there. But the road is very treacherous and I don't think it's a good idea for you to go there. Thank you. Sure. Hey, excuse me sir. Boy, you walk real fast. I had a tough time catching you up. Oh, thank you for what you did for me. My name is Annie. I'm Eagle. Where are you going now? Over across that mountain? Oh what a coincidence, I'll walk with you. My house is right past the woods. I guess you know why I'm here. It was your challenge and it was I who won. You're so stupid. What are you doing, hey? What are you doing? He really hit your head. It was nothing. I'm sorry. I've caused you all this trouble haven't I? Believe me, it was nothing. You're not from this part of the country, are you? I'm from the south. Well, you came a long way then. May I ask you what you're doing here? It's personal. Eat something, it's the least we can do. I can't stay though. I must find someone. Really? Who is it to make you come all this way? I have come from my enemy killed my parents. So... Say, do you know where this person is? No. But I don't care where he is. I will find him and make him pay. I just don't understand this. You know, sometimes a person will do things that he really doesn't mean to do at all and then regrets it. Not him though. This man is a killer. He loves blood. You know something? You too smell of blood. That's the blood of revenge. Not murder. I'm not saying you're wrong. But did you think what if he has a child who loves him? When is this going to end? Hey, now father dinner is getting cold here. Of course, come on let's eat then. Thank you, sir. Don't be so polite. It's getting dark outside so stay here tonight. Thank you. No, I don't know where my father went. Well, please thank him for me when he does come back. When you finish with your business, remember to come back and look for me. Well, definitely sure I do. Alright, I almost forgot. I prepared something for you. Please wait. It's not necessary. Oh, no, no, just wait. I won't be long. I promise you, just wait. It's you. Forgive me, I'm doing this all because of my daughter, Annie, you know. I remember you. Don't do it! Oh Daddy, are you alright? My child, it's my fault. Maybe it's better after all that it ends up this way. You're saying that you know Eagle? Annie, my child don't do it. Please, please. I beg of you don't kill her. She has nothing to do with what happened at all. It was all my fault. Oh my god! Daddy! Annie, don't be childish now. You must go on living for me, please. Oh Daddy, you just can't die. No, you can't. I'm sorry, forgive me. I'm sorry about what happened, Eagle. I beg you. Annie, please. My daughter Annie, please... Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Did you think... What if he has a child who loves him? When is this going to end? I'll kill you. Please, don't do this to me. Please let me get down, please. Let you go? Of course. Stop that now. What do you think you're doing? What is it to you? You're in Boris' territory. You're a dead man now. I don't know Boris. How dare you! Who is Boris? Oh. My leg. Help me. No. I'm sorry, General. It won't happen again, I promise you. It better not. That eagle is still alive. I want him dead. Yes, General. Excuse me, boss. Hey, what would you like? I want some buns to go. Very well, sir. Who is your leader? Very well since you're also brave. I'll count to three and after that don't be sorry. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. Please don't kill me. So who is your leader? General. General. General Long. General Long. Yes, yes, yes. All right, you're free to go now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Does he have a woman named Jade with him? I've never seen her but I'm quite sure she's there. Never seen her? Yes, we were never allowed to go inside his private palace at all. All right, your friends are not dead, I didn't kill them. They'll soon wake up. I see that you don't want to live after all. Oh, please do it again. Please don't kill me. Oh please don't kill me. Oh no, please don't kill me. You don't live very well either. Now say goodbye. You're lucky I was in a good mood today. Oh, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Sir. You forgot to take your food, look here. Thank you. There were more people in the world like you, it'd be a much more peaceful. Thanks again. Thank you. Thank you. Sleep well, my child. You don't know how ugly the world is. You're so very lucky. Here. That's the girl. - I appreciate this. - Thank you. Why don't you kill me? You're gonna regret it. Because I'll kill you. You can count on. You won't get rid of me unless you can kill me. Come on, just go ahead. Kill me. - You come back here and kill me now. - Hey lady, wait a minute. Lady, wait! I don't know what you're up to. But if you let me fix your foot, then we can talk. Let's get out of it guys come on. Hey, you can't just go like this. Where do you think you're going? Come back here and pay. What are you doing? Hey, you can't go... You come here right now. What do you think you're doing? Stop it, cowards. Oh, what are you doing? Oh my god! Who the hell are you? Let's just say I dislike men who beat up on women. Hey, he's a real good boy. Or maybe this woman's lover, how about that? You're really gonna regret saying that, Jr. What are you gonna do about it lover boy? We might let you go if you kneel down and apologize to all of us. Sorry, if I offended you asshole, no way. Son of a bitch. Why don't you fight like a man? I don't want to hurt you children. Oh yeah. Hold it. Oh mister, oh mister. Thank you so much. I don't know how I could ever thank you. Well, no need. Oh wait. Now mister, you can't go. My life was saved by you. I should pay you otherwise I won't feel right. I don't need you to pay me. You misunderstand me. I wasn't talking about money. I see. So what is it that you want me to do? Good, let me just get you a little food and something to drink. Hold it, that's quite enough. Oh you must drink more now, not just one cup. All right, I'll drink this. Oh by the way, where are you going in such a rush? I'm just looking for someone. Oh may I ask who he is? General Long. Ah, you and him? What is it? Are you friends with him then? He went out to go hunting. He will not return until tomorrow. Really. Don't worry. I'll take you to see him tomorrow. Let go of me. I'm here to see Uncle Long. Let go of me. Shut up. Bring her inside. Let's go, come on. What's all the noise? She sneaked in here. Uncle Long, it's me. My little Annie, it's really you. You men better let her go. Yes, sir. I'm sorry about your father. I heard about it. Looks like you've come a very long way. Why don't we go inside and rest first, all right? Thank you, Uncle. Hey, you guys. Don't worry, I put drugs in his drink. I did tell you I take you to General Long. I didn't lie, did I? You woman are no good at all. So, you're here. Oh, General Long, how are you? You did well. Oh, it's nothing General. It's the least I can do. Yeah. Thank you so much. You really shouldn't have done it. It's yours. Oh, thank you again. I must be going now so goodbye. Goodbye. So tell me what you want from me right now. I'm gonna kill you for all the lives you are destroyed. You will pay for everything. Bastard. Even if I die, I'll take you with me. You don't scare me. Hold it. Everybody. After her! Don't let her get away. So how did he get away? I don't know how he did it. What's that? You bunch of idiots. I know I'll get him back. Go and get him then. He can't be very far from here. Yes, I'll go now. You men, spread out, follow me. Come on. Dear God, please help Eagle. Dear God. - Let's go. - Yes, sir. Please help. Get down, men. Thank you, God. Come on. But there's no sign of his footprints now. Well, we'll look around. - We'll find him. - Yeah. Thank you, God. Thank you. Eagle, get up. Get up, Eagle. Eagle, get up now. You must get up! Eagle! Eagle, get up. How could you let him go? When you know he's the one who killed your father. So who was it that murdered his parents, took away his wife and made him into a murderer then? It's us. When he killed my father, I had the same pain. I understand everything now when it's not his fault. How can you say such a thing? Have you forgotten how difficult all our lives were? Of course, I haven't forgotten. Although we weren't rich, we were at least still human beings. Yet you murdered everyone, killed everyone so you could be rich. Are you happy now? No, I don't think so. You're a murderer! You won't get away with this, you know? Damn you, be quiet! God dammit, you don't know what you're talking about. You men, must bring him back. - Sir. - Yes. I don't care how you do it, you get him back to me. - Yes, General. - Yes, General. Go down. - Sir. - Sir. What are you doing? I'm only following orders. Make sure you have her followed. There he is, come on let's get him. You can't get away. You'd better come with this quietly now, Eagle. You're pathetic, go get him. Continue, don't stop. Please, young men. He's already hurt badly. You should just dismiss now and let him go. It's none of your business. Go back to your temple. But it's not right to kill and that even you must know. Don't give me that bullshit. How dare you say that? Bastard. Yes, now go and help that man. Yes, master. Good of you to come. Sorry, I'm so weak. Evil forces have combined in this country very recently, so you must combine your force with Eagle and only then will ever be destroyed once and for all. Yes. I can give you some pointers in fighting. I will teach you all that I can. So that justice can be done. And you're here... to destroy him or so I'm told that, that is your destiny. Oh no. What do you want from me? You can't get away from me. What do you want? Tell me now! I'm only following orders. - Oh no, no don't! - Come on. Don't, put me down! Let go of me! Let go! No! Get off me! No! No! No! I'll show you. Oh, no! Help me, somebody! Help! No! Help! Help me! Get off! What are you doing? You better leave now. I'll kill you, you god damn monk. Right, you asked for it. Thank you. Thank you. Hopefully, Leon will be able to destroy Boris with the skills that I taught him. And once I have got rid of Long, they will finally be peace throughout this land. Come on miss, this way. Yes. - No! - Don't do it! Oh, no. Get up, Annie. I'm glad you're safe now. I am sorry. What do you say? Sorry won't do anything, will it? Tell me, Annie. Can you ever forgive me? I'm glad you didn't do anything unwise. Buddha is looking after you, no doubt. All this killing must end. It is against the natural order of things. You must remember that, always. Yes, I will. It's all over now. What? So you're telling me, five guys couldn't handle one lousy monk. You're useless! Get more men together and go to the temple now. I want them back. Yes, sir. Be careful, Eagle is dangerous. My darling Eagle, you're still alive. Jade! - Oh my God! Eagle! - Eagle! - Come on, move it! - Go men! Eagle! Oh my God! All right, bring Eagle and the monk back to me. And no mistakes this time. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Master. Master. What it is my child? It seems that Eagle has disappeared. What? Do you think that he could be... How good of you to come. I don't want to fight you. Just give me Jade back. You can forget that. I don't like the idea. I'm gonna send you to hell. Let her go. That'll be the end of it. You must let her go. She's mine now. Eagle! Eagle! Noooo! Jade! Jade! Daddy. Oh, Daddy. Get away! It's dangerous. Get away from here. Oh. Oh. Please, Mr. Jung. Don’t kill my Daddy. I, I love him please. I beg you. If you must to punish him, you can punish me too. I love, I love my Daddy. Oh, please! Please don’t kill my Daddy. I love him so. Oh, please! Oh, Daddy. Stop it! Oh, Daddy. Daddy, oh. Don't you ever try and kill again, Long. This is over. Let it be.
