(DISTANT SIRENS WAILING) Let me tell you somethin'. New York is the greatest fuckin' city in the world. My city. I was a kid in these streets, I started in the fuckin' gutter, and I made it to the top. This life ends one of two ways, dead or in jail. I did both. (CELL DOOR UNLOCKING) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) (DOOR LOCK BUZZING) (CUFFS CLICKING) (DOOR LOCK BUZZING) JOHN: I made my bones doin' a piece of work for Don Carlo Gambino. I don't need to tell you what happened. You know. But the commission is moving. The families will not allow this type of crime to go unchecked. I mean, Carlo, he paid the kidnappers. He complied with their every demand. And how did they respond? By leaving the kid in a fuckin' Dumpster. Now, each of the families is organizing a team to head the hunt for the kidnappers. But as far as I'm concerned, this is a Gambino matter. And we will not fuckin' stand down. This is our responsibility. So John, I want you to head the Gambino team. We're not only doing this for Carlo, we're doing this for the whole family. I understand. I want you to take care of this for me. It would be an honor. Consider it done. Ah, Jesus Christ, you look at these fuckin' bums? Missy, hit me again, will ya? Whisky neat, coming right up. James McBratney? You're under arrest. I guess somebody better call the cops then, huh? (GRUNTS) (WOMAN SCREAMS) Let's go. (TV: BELL DINGS) Motherfucker! Hey! Down. (HANGS UP PHONE) Not a word. JOHN: After I had a successful hit under my belt, Carlo Gambino opened up the books for the first time since 1957. And like that, I became a made man. Can you believe the way they bring me in here? Like I'm Hannibal the fucking Cannibal or something. I got the trifecta. I got jaw, neck and throat. They took my tit and they put it on my face. I only do one-armed pushups 'cause they took the whole chest muscle out. - Those fucking butchers. - Yeah. My body betrayed me, John, but not my mind, and not my heart. That'll never happen. I'm still here, John. I'm still motherfuckin' these guys at every turn. (EXHALES) So... what's up? They ordered me a visit. I thought at least I'd maybe get a phone call, but the judge insisted I get the visit. John, they didn't do this out of the kindness of their hearts. So I'm gonna ask you again. What's up? I'm thinking about taking a plea. A plea? And what are their expectations of you in this plea? Five and a half to seven years. Five and a half or seven? Which is it? Look, I don't want you should stay in prison one motherfucking more day. I would rather have this cancer than you have a cold. But, I'm tellin' you, if I robbed a church and I had the steeple sticking out of my ass, - I would deny it. - I know, Dad. I know... Okay, so I'm telling you, as a father... not as a boss, but as a father... if you say that you're innocent, I believe you. So why would you stand up in front of these motherfuckers and say that you're guilty? - Why would you do that? - Because if I take this plea, it's over. They're not gonna keep coming after me with more charges. I get closure. Closure. Let me make sure I heard that straight. "Closure." What kind of a mealy-mouth word is that? This is a... this is a word for over-educated, under-intelligent motherfuckers. This is not a word that's in my vocabulary. My boys are still young kids, Dad. If I take this plea, I'm back with them before they're teenagers. If I lose at trial, I'm doing 20 years. Like they never had a father. WOMAN: She's a nice woman. She's a nice woman now 'cause she's dying of cancer. Two weeks ago everybody hated her. Now she's Miss Popularity. I'm just... I'm just sayin'. - When's Halloween? - Next week. Next week, this week, what do I know? Every day is Halloween in this place. What are you gonna be? Officer Mike down the block's gonna let me use his policeman's hat. I'm going as a cop. - What's the matter with you? - With me? What are you doing to my son? Oh, so now he's your son alone? 'Cause of you, I'm alone with them. Let me tell you somethin'. No kid of mine is gonna be a cop for Halloween, and that's it. - It's not gonna happen. - Johnny, he's just a kid. Today he wants to be a cop, tomorrow an astronaut. If I ever hear that you let my son or any of my kids... or you for that matter... talk to that cop or any cop, I'll kill you. Relax, he's just being nice to your son. Don't make me repeat myself, Victoria. And you... you don't dress like a cop, you don't act like a cop, and you don't talk like a cop. You understand me? - What the matter with you? - Me? What's the matter with you? Don't start, Victoria, okay? I'm not in the mood. Don't talk to me like that. You think you're such a tough guy. Do you know what you're doing to this family? And you're gonna kill me? - I'd like to see you try. - Don't get smart with me. Now, look, what do you wanna... What do you want to be? Why don't you ask him what he wants to be instead? - What do you wanna be? - Um, a baseball player? No, no. You don't wanna be a baseball player. Why don't you be Casper the Ghost? You put a... You put a sheet over and make the holes... - Casper's for five-year-olds. - What was you? What was you last year? You were a princess last year, right? - And what was you? You was a... - GUARD: Time's up, Gotti. Ah! Gotta go. - I love youse. - I love you, too. JOHN: After being ID'd by the barmaid, they sent me to Green Haven Penitentiary... Give me a kiss. ...where I served two years out of a four-year sentence. With the guards in my back pocket, I was able to get medical furloughs to see the family dentist. Not a cavity in sight, Mr. Gotti. - We'll see you next time. - Thanks. JOHN: And while I was at it, I was able to clean up some unfinished McBratney business. (WOMAN SCREAMING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Remember what I used to tell youse guys? It was me, Angelo and Frankie, we'd say we was goin' out of town and that we were at a construction job. We was gonna build this big wall, and it was gonna take three years. Remember? Yeah. John, I want what's best for you and your family. I know that, Dad, I know. And the idea of just one day you being in prison makes me sick. But I don't know what makes me sicker, you being in prison, or you bowing to these pieces of shit. What bowing? There's no bowing, it's a compromise. They get their pound of flesh, I get my peace of mind. The peace of mind that one day I'll be there for my family when I am needed. - Oh, John. John! - That's what this is. How could you be so naive? Once they get you in, you will never be free again. Do you understand that? They say you win this time, but next time, they'll make sure that you don't. There won't be a next time. I've always felt in my heart that the day would come when my family and I'd get separated by prison. I'm just thankful it isn't for life. And this plea will ensure that. JOHN: I had high hopes for Johnny Boy. Me? I was born with four fuckin' cents to my name. (CHUCKLES) And now I got a kid going to the New York Military Academy. Johnny Boy, come on! (CLAPS) Let's go! We ain't got all day. What's the matter? You guys look like your brother's going to the electric chair. Cheer up. Why don't you go, uh, go get some ice cream. - Pizza or something. - I don't like ice cream. Get Fudge Sticks. You love Fudge Sticks, get them. - I don't like pizza, either. - How 'bout the movies? You like... What's that movie you like so much? About spaghetti. Meatballs or something. Go see that. Come on. We ain't got all day! All right, guys. Come here. All right, you guys better not get into any trouble while I'm gone. Look out for your brother, all right? - Give me a hug. - JOHN: All right, enough, enough. - Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. - I'll see ya. - Wait, wait. Hey, hey. - Ma! Ma, I gotta go. - Butch, please! - Ma, I gotta go. I made youse a tuna sandwich for the road. Okay, you know what? You're gonna see him this weekend. (DOG BARKING) JOHN: At my house, more often than not, - was Angelo Ruggiero. - Hey, Pete. My best friend since we was kids. - Hey, Ange. - Hey, Vic. - He up yet? - You talk to him. I've tried. - (ANGELO CHUCKLES) - Hey, Uncle Ange. Hey. Whoa. You know what's good for you, don't let your dad see that cop car. Come on, you fucking prick. Come on, co... Look at this. Come on. Ah, co... Oh, motherfucker! You know what fuckin' time it is? Did you see that? Did you see that? I got six dimes on Buffalo. They're killin' us, ten to nothin'. I put six dimes on New England, they're killin' us. I put six dimes on Chicago, they're losin'. And now I put three dimes on Kansas City. They're winning, but they'll fucking blow it. - Motherfuckers! - Maybe you should hang yourself. - Leave your troubles behind. - Smart ass. Listen, you wouldn't believe how much I lost last week. Don't wanna believe. Don't wanna know. Just once, you know, I'd give my fuckin' life, just that to have the Redskins win once. I got a Redskin named Willie Boy in the car. I gotta clean up. Motherfuckers! (YELLS) - Uncle Ange, look. - Whatcha got there, Frankie? Oh! No, you didn't. Straight A's? I've never seen anything like this. Hey, Frankie Boy, you show Uncle Ange your report card? Can you believe it? My son's a goddamn genius. My Frankie's gonna be a rocket scientist. - What do you think about that, Ange? - Let's go. We won't be home for dinner. What are you talking about? It's Sunday night. I gotta repeat myself? I'm not comin' home for dinner! - Johnny, it's family night! - I'll make it up to youse. FEMALE REPORTER: Manhattan's Garment District has long been central to the Mafia's portfolio of lucrative rackets, and a hugely profitable adjunct to the Mob's historic stranglehold on trucking and labor unions. Authorities believe that this man, John Gotti, a feared captain in the Gambino family, is the mobster primarily in control of extortion, corruption, and robbery within the multimillion-dollar New York fashion industry. Gotti is perceived as an up and comer in the Mafia organized crime family... JOHN: Johnny Boy was tough. He knew how to handle himself. I told him tell anybody who had the balls to ask what his father did for a living that I was a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week street guy. JOHN: Who's this fucking guy think he is, huh? He's Greek. He doesn't have his head screwed up straight. What, he just got off the boat yesterday? Who gave him permission to run book in Howard Beach? - Who? - I... I told him. - I read him the riot act. - Why did you tell him? This motherfucker's on the phone talking about me! My name! He says he's with the Greek mafia. This mook is so full of shit it ain't funny. Ms. Luzio, hold up, hold up. Lou. Louie, go help her. I'll take care of it, Mr. Gotti. Get that shit off your face. He looks like a beatnik. Why don't you grab 50 percent of this asshole's business? I want this shut down yesterday. You understand? This guy's a nobody, and even if he was a somebody, I don't give a fuck. - You understand me? - Yeah. - Hey, hey, hey! - Mr. Gotti, how are you? You're still in the fight? Yeah, you still working out? Not that much anymore. No? What's the matter? You was the great white hope. Well, they just fucking closed down Tully's. Tully's an institution. How long's Tully been around? MAN: I've been walking by Tully's for 40 years. What happened? What the fuck happened? I don't know. Rent's goin' up. They got cited for some code violation or something. Yeah. Well, don't you worry. They're back in business. All right. How's your father? How's his liver? He's... He's still here. He's still here. All right, man. Well, you tell him hello from me, all right? - Gotti, thank you. Thank you. - (CHUCKLES) All right. All right. Come back to the center. I don't give a fuck who this guy is. He's using my name on the phone. So you tell this cocksucker that if he ever deals another card in Queens, or ever even whispers my name again, I, me, John Gotti, will sever his motherfucking head off! - VICTORIA: Put a little ice on it. - Ma, I'm... Ma! Okay. I'll fix you something to eat. - (DOOR SHUTS) - JOHN: Get your feet off the couch. Get up. You got suspended, huh? What do you think you're doing? These local kids jumped a couple of our guys. We're just handling our business. You're handling your business? - Yeah. I guess. - You guess. You show up? Yeah. I'd say so. (EXHALES) Attaboy. You stood your ground. You didn't back off. Never back off. You always stand up. You fight till you can't fight no more. Never take a backwards step, ever. Dad, I'm thinking maybe I don't wanna try for West Point anymore. Maybe take a year off. Take a year off? Drop out of school? Not go to college? Become a bum on the street? Is that what you want? Huh? What are you thinking? (CHUCKLING) You wanna hang out with me? Is that what you're thinking? Jesus Christ. Ah! Butch! I'm hungry! JOHN: If they get it, they're good. It's just like if they're good, they get what they get paid. - A lot of 'em are bums. - That's for sure. - Ah. - The Luccheses are here. - I don't like that guy. - Which one? His name is Gaspipe. Oh, yeah. I heard of him. He's trouble. He's up in Angelo's face about them apartments on 59th Street. I hear he's a real sicko. Look at him. Look at him. He's making sure all the families know his name. The prick. - Relax. He's not our business. - (SIGHS) Sweetheart? Can we get another round here, please? You got it. - Let me ask you something. - Hm. What do you think the Genovese capos think of the boss? What are you talking about? I mean, I understand the whole insanity plea, but come on, running around town in the fucking pajamas, give me a fucking break. JOHN: Vincent "The Chin" Gigante. According to the government, the powerful boss of the Genovese crime family. To me, he was a rival. Chin is a very smart guy. He runs his family as he sees fit. I can tell you this: You would never see Chin and his crew in a place like this, that's for fucking sure. Well, talking about bosses who hide... Don't start. I'm just telling you, he's not here. He's never here. How can you run a family if you're not on the ground with them? Johnny, you have got to shut the fuck up. Paul is your boss. End of fuckin' story. Who's this? Who is that guy with Frankie? What's his name again? - That's Sammy Bull. - That's Sammy. Why Bull? Bulls Head, Staten Island. I know about him. You don't like anybody here tonight. I just don't like what I hear about him, okay? That's all I'm saying. He's a good earner and he's Frankie's guy. He ain't never done time. And I don't trust anybody who's never done time. Well, he's our friend now. And listen, you trust Frankie, don't you? Frankie would vouch to the fucking moon for this kid. - We gotta give him a chance. - Here they come. Hi boys. How you doing tonight? Hey, Johnnie. - How you doing, Neil? - How are you, Sammy? - Frank. - Frankie. Sammy, I'd like you to meet a good friend of ours and a dear friend of mine, John Gotti. How you doing, John? Heard a lot about you from Frankie. - Glad to finally meet. - All good, I hope. Of course it's good. How am I gonna talk about my brother? Let me tell you somethin'. Time in Lewisburg will make a man out of you. Am I right, Frankie? You come out of there thicker than thieves. - Right? - My fuckin' brother, Johnny. Let's raise a glass to our new friend. - Salute, guys. - Salute. - Neil. - Frankie. You trust this kid? Thank you. John... we walk together and we fall together. This is the life. I chose my side over 40 years ago. The hardest thing in this world for me to do would be to have to say goodbye to my kids. - I can't do it. - I don't want you to. I don't want you have to lie to your kids and you telling 'em you are on some construction job. You and me, John, we never had to lie to each other. But it's the lies you tell yourself, these are the lies you gotta live with. And missing your kids? You think that's bad? Do I really have to say it? Do I? Frankie. No, leave the light on. VICTORIA: Frankie, we're just down the hall. Let him leave the light on. Kids are scared of the dark. Just till John gets back? - Till John gets back. - Okay. G'night, Frankie. Love you. See you tomorrow. VICTORIA: Love you.

She's gonna be all right. He's a stupid fucking asshole, John. He never fixed the dent in their car. He leaves it there in the driveway, day after day, for Vicky to see. John. We can't know why God lets these things happen, but there has to be a reason. A reason? For these things? He was 12 years old. He didn't have a hair on his prick. There ain't no fuckin' reason. There ain't no fuckin' God. Don't say another word. I'm gonna take Vicky down to Florida, see her family. I think it'd be good for us. Clear her head. On March 12, 1980, 12-year-old Frank Gotti was riding his mini-bike on this street, 157th Avenue, just three blocks from his home. John Favara's car hit 12-year-old Frank Gotti and killed him. People who know the Gottis say they never came to terms with young Frank's death. Police, however, believe someone did come to terms with John Favara. On July 28th, Favara left his job and walked to his car, which was parked next door at the Capitol Diner. The diner's owner told police he saw three men club Favara and shove him into a van. The best witness police had in the abduction of John Favara was Leon Papon, the man who owned the diner. He had seen the whole thing. He told that to Nassau County Police. But then the assailants returned to the diner several days later. They reportedly ordered coffee. And as they sipped it, they stared at Papon. Right after that, Papon stopped cooperating with Nassau County detectives. His memory of the incident faded. He sold the diner and moved away. (SIGHS) Okay, that's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Vicky. Enough. I love you, but we got four other kids. We will never let go of Frankie, you understand me? Never. He's in our hearts forever. Forever. Till the day we die. We're gonna always live like we're seven. I'm gonna make you some coffee. (UP-TEMPO JAZZ PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHTER) No problem. Merry Christmas. Look at him.

Let's do it. JOHN: Sammy Gravano told me something. What did Sammy Gravano say? That you was over at Paul's house just now. Yeah, I was at Paul's house just now. Did you see Sammy there? I just stopped by for two minutes. Well, he tells Paul, he says, "I wanna go see Neil to wish him a Merry Christmas." Why do I give a shit about all this? 'Cause Paul said "What the hell you wanna do that for? You're on our side." And what did Sammy say to that? He said "We're all a family, ain't we?" And Neil's the underboss." Sammy told you that? Sammy told me. Hey! What's happening? (CONTINUING, INDISTINCT) (INAUDIBLE) (LAUGHTER, CHATTER) MAN: ♪ I've got it good That's what they say ♪ Paul!

He's the boss! End of fuckin' story. Time magazine says you're the boss. Shows you what a disreputable fucking profession that is. You know why? Let me tell you why. I'll tell you why. Because we've never been under this kind of scrutiny before. No. They can see you, Neil. Yeah, too fuckin' much, evidently. No, no, no, no. You can sit, you can talk man-to-man with you. You know what I'm saying? I mean what's Paul's contribution to society, fuckin' his Portuguese maid? As long as it keeps him off of my back. But, 35 years in the same house as his wife, I mean, that ain't right. - That ain't right. - (CHUCKLES, COUGHS) (COUGHS) Course, you gotta give him credit. Credit for what, his penile implant? - (SNICKERING) - You got his house bugged, do you? Yeah, I defeated that $50,000 security system with my good looks. That Portuguese maid was crazy about me. She's Guatemalan, you know so fucking much. Did you ever see her? Whatever country she's from, they probably made her leave. I wouldn't fuck her with your dick. - (LAUGHING) - (LAUGHING) Listen, Paul's got diabetes. What're you gonna do? Huh?

And that man's gonna pay to protect you! I didn't kill the guy! I'll answer for it. Anything! We didn't kill anybody. I know that. But it doesn't fuckin' matter. You two stupid motherfuckers. You brought a lot of fuckin' heat down on this family. JOHN: Actually, it was Angelo who brought the heat down on the family when the government released what would become known as "the Angelo Ruggiero tapes." They picked up Ange on a wiretap, talking about various activities that neither Paul or the government would've sanctioned. Fucking Ange. This is ridiculous! You got popped, Ange. Let me just ask you one question. Are you badmouthing Paul on them tapes? - Are you? - I don't know. - Come on! Come on! - That's hundreds of hours, John! What? You don't remember nothing? They bugged my daughter's phone! What were you sayin' on the tapes? I said a lotta things that could get a lotta people in a lotta trouble is what I said. My friends are on those tapes. Our friends are on those tapes. Neil, okay. If... If Angelo decides that he doesn't want to turn these tapes over to Paul, what happens? Is that it? No. That is most definitely not fucking it. (SIGHS) If Paul wants the tapes, we gotta get him the tapes. He's the boss. Boss is the boss is the boss, that's "La Cosa Nostra." Don't tell me that I don't know it's about La Cosa Nostra. Please. If it was just some fuckin' asshole gettin' called out, or some Joe, you know, I would authorize the handover in a second. - But this... is our friends. - NEIL: Now, look. If the government has a case, Paul will find out when it comes to trial because it'll be a matter of public record. - You're fucked either way. - We're fucked. Okay. We're fucked either way. No, no. That's not gonna happen. Get it out of your head right now. John. Hey, John. Listen. You know that Paul doesn't give two fucks about me or you. He's shitting bricks over his own fuckin' case. You don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about. Ange, just shut the fuck up, will ya? You got us into this mess. - Please. - Get the fuck outta here, Ange. Go on. (NEIL SIGHING) Christ almighty. I ain't sayin' you're wrong, but what do you want me to tell Paul? I mean... Ange sayin' to a boss, "Fuck you, I" don't wanna hand over those fuckin' tapes." I've been trying to make this thing go away, but... (EXHALES) Paul keeps bringing it up. Unless I say to him, "Fuck you, go fuck yourself." And then, you know what we gotta do then, huh? We roll 'em up and we go to war. That's right, we gotta do what we gotta do. We strike him before he gets us. Yeah. - (GROANS) - What? - (GROANING) - What's the matter? You okay? - Yeah, no... - What do you need? It's just... it'll pass. (LAUGHS) It's funny. All this fuckin' tapes and trials, and we spend all this time tryin' to stay one step ahead of the game, but this fuckin' cancer, I mean... That is the ultimate "fuck you." (CAR STARTS) (SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE) If I didn't have bad luck, I'd have no luck at all. Ah, beautiful! You got somethin' for me? See this kid here? I used to give him five dollars to go to the candy store. Now look at him, he's a fuckin' earner. Here. Buy yourself a new sports jacket, 'cause we are going to Regine's tonight. Tonight. Tonight. (LAUGHING) Let me tell you something about your old man. When he was sent up to Green Haven on the McBratney thing, as you probably know about, Carlo Gambino was so grateful to your father for his service to him... (WHISPERING) ...he got him Roy Cohn to defend him. Roy Cohn, biggest fuckin' lawyer in the country. (LAUGHS) Your dad wasn't even a made man at the time. Cohn, he makes a deal on a plea, gets it reduced to involuntary manslaughter. Your dad's out in four. What a lot of people don't know about is, uh... how your dad came to be arrested in the first place. Your dad was lyin' low, he's in the wind, and he hears I have this problem with the Genovese family. He showed up, interceded on my behalf at a sit-down in Maspeth. And the FBI picked him up on a tip-off as he was leaving. Loyalty cuts both ways with him. PROSECUTOR: Your Honor, the prosecution contends that Mr. Gotti is a clear and continuing danger to the community, and in lieu of a potential life sentence in this case, it would be imprudent to grant him bail. Thank you, Miss Giacalone, but you have not convinced me that Mr. Gotti is a flight risk. The court grants bail in the amount of one million dollars. ATTORNEY: Your Honor, as the court has granted bail for Mr. Gotti, we also request that bail be set at a reasonable amount for Mr. Johnson. PROSECUTOR: Your Honor, we have strong reason to believe that this defendant's life will be in serious jeopardy if he is granted bail. And why would that be? Because Wilfred Johnson has been a confidential informant for the FBI for the past 19 years. - That is a lie! - JUDGE: Order! Order! Gotti! They're lyin'! She's lyin'! - I'll fuckin' kill you! - Order! - Lie! Lyin'! - Order! - Gonna get me killed! - We will have order! Counsel, restrain your client. In light of that information, if confirmed, bail is denied on Johnson. If I stand strong... if I refuse to testify, and we win... ...can I get a pass? I'm begging you. Swear it. Swear it on your kid's grave you won't kill me. How am I gonna kill a ghost? JUDGE: May I have the verdict, please? JOHN: Me and Willie Boy Johnson beat a massive RICO case due to the lack of credibility of the government's witness. JURY FOREMAN: ...find the defendants, John Joseph Gotti and Wilfred Johnson, not guilty. (CROWD MURMURING) JOHN: As for Willie Boy, that's another story. JOHN: Dominic's been doing fireworks for years. BOBBY: Dominic ain't got two fingers. It's my gift to them. They can do the fireworks the way I like it. (CONTINUES, INDISTINCT) - Look at this. - Oh, this fuckin' thing. All right, you wanna have some fun? - Let's go have some fun. - (CHUCKLES) Is there a problem here? We're shutting you down, guys. This is an unpermitted street gathering, and there are illegal fireworks on these premises. What are you talkin' about? We been doin' this for 20 years. Let me ask you something. You're gonna put these good people in jail because they're proud of their country? Is that right? You got my lawyer on the phone? - Standing by. - You got bail money? - With interest. - Send 'em up! (CROWD CHEERING) Next time, Gotti. Next time. (CROWD CHANTING) Gotti! Gotti! Gotti! This is your town, John. (CHANTING CONTINUES) Gotti! Gotti! Gotti! Gotti! Gotti! Gotti! Gotti! Look at this one. How good am I to you? Go ahead, taste. (LAUGHS) - Huh? - It's not bad. I know. Hey. Excuse me. I don't normally do this, but I saw you walkin' over. I'd hate myself the rest of my life if I didn't come and talk to you. Stop it, John. You're not funny. Wait. Do we know each other? What, you lose your memory at the military academy or something? (LAUGHS) It's me, Kim. Come on, John. Joey Rug's daughter. I'm sorry. It's just... you look different. Guess I grew up. Yeah, I guess you did. You wanna get a beer or something? John, I'm 16. (LAUGHS) Oh! Uh, you wanna get a soda? - Yeah, that sounds nice. - All right. Let's go. See ya both. Joey Rugs. Paul wants to see you. And I held him back as long as I can. Not the fuckin' Angelo tapes again. It's got nothing to do with Angelo. Paul has decided to break up your crew. - He's gonna break up the crew. - Mm. The fuck does that mean? If Paul goes to prison, he wants to make sure that everybody knows he's still the boss. It's like Carlo fuckin' Gambino all over again. Everybody knows that it should have been you. All right, well, what you want and what you get are two different things. - If he wants reassurance, forget about it. - No, no, no, he will get it. And you'd better fuckin' agree with him or at least look like you do. He doesn't deserve it, Neil. Look... look, you gotta earn your merits like we did. What world are you livin' in? All fuckin' Paul is about is money. Okay? That's his get-off. That's it. Comin' from a fuckin' degenerate gambler. You're goddamn right. You can't take it with you. Hm. Yeah. (SIGHS) - If Paul makes a move on Angelo... - You will live with it. - If he gives you that choice. - There is no choice. - There's only what you do. - Listen to me. You kill the boss of bosses... - I will defend my position. - ...you will bring down hellfire. - I'll do what I gotta do. - Not as long as I'm alive. Jesus. I can't... I ju... I can't get over Willie Boy. - Well. - (DRY LAUGH) Shows you life is full of surprises. He's been with you since Fulton-Rockaway Boys, huh? Bunch of punk kids who had the balls to stick up one of my poker games. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, you never know. I know. He broke my fuckin' heart. NEIL: You give him a pass? Yeah. Attack from the outside you can deal with. But attack from the inside? You're history. Once you take that first step, there's no turning back. You either succeed, or you're lost in enemy territory. And if you miss, you die. And all your friends will die. So you'll need DeCicco. If he's onboard, then Joe Piney will join you, he'll take care of the old-timers. And Gallo will go along. (WOMAN SOBS) PASTOR: The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff... (CLEARS THROAT) (PASTOR CONTINUES, INDISTINCT) In the name of the Father, and the Son... Obviously, Paul couldn't make it, but he sends his prayers. (EXHALES) Let me tell you somethin'. Neil could have taken the family from Paul any time he wanted. Everybody knows that. Paul. Up on that hill. You gotta kiss his ring like he was the Pope. Fuck Paul. I hear you. I'm with you. NEIL: You'll need DeCicco. If he's onboard, then Joe Piney will join you. He'll take care of the old-timers. And Gallo will go along. D.B. is important because he will smooth out all the rough edges and make sure that everybody knows it's only business, but you're gonna need the approval of the other families. Frank and Sammy Bull will pay homage to Brooklyn. The Luccheses won't be a problem. You got Pescucci on your side, so the Bonnanos we're not worried about. Leave the Colombos to Angelo. He'll feel the pulse with Freddy DeVico and Benny Cans. And that leaves the Chin. NEIL: Chin. You think I'm a stickler for the rules? Chin will not be happy no matter what. But he'll be outnumbered, so... for the sake of a peaceful transition, - he'll just have to accept. - I don't know. I don't know. Paul and the Chin are pretty tight. They got a lotta money on the street. Yeah, well, you'll take care of that after. And use D.B. for that. Listen, nobody's cutting in on Chin's action. On the contrary, with Paul out of the way, what's Chin's is Chin's, free and clear. I have no doubt the other families will back you, but only if you have the support of all five boroughs, Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island, The Bronx. Eh? - (CARS STARTING) - And that's a fist. (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE) JOHN: So what it comes down to is what do you wanna be. And I'm askin' you. You wanna be consigliere? You wanna be underboss? Because we're gonna do this thing, we're gonna do it right. It's gonna be La Cosa Nostra. La Cosa Nostra till I die. Underboss, John. Paul's set up a dinner next Thursday. Friends only. To discuss the reorganization of the family. (JOHN SIGHS) We're on a piece of work. It's a big job, but there's no two ways about it... it's gotta be done. Give 'em the coats and hats. The hats is all anyone's gonna remember seeing. We're around the corner from the United Nations. They'll think the fuckin' Russians are comin'. Listen up. Pay attention. We're hittin' Paul. And anyone else who's in the car with him. (ENGINE STARTING) JOHN: It's gonna take place at Sparks Steak House. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) That's up at 46th, between 2nd and 3rd. He's got a six o'clock reservation. There's gonna be a lot of last minute Christmas shoppers, but that's perfect for us. We're gonna get in and out... Bzang. Like the Pittsburgh Steelers. So it's kill or be killed. Let's go. - Jimmy. - How you doin? Good. Good. Can I have a bourbon and ice, please? So, Frank... This business with the Gotti crew... is very troublesome to Paul. I know you like John. Hell, I like John. But now that Neil's out of the picture, Paul just wants to... shake up the whole administration. And he wants you to be comfortable with it. Eh, Paul's running a little late. Paul's here. He's not gonna make dinner. - (CAR STARTS) - We gotta go. (SIRENS APPROACHING) (NEWS FANFARE PLAYING) The assassination of Paul Castellano has local and federal officials looking for the men who did it and for a motive. Finding either or both extremely difficult, given the secrecy of organized crime, we may never know why Castellano was killed. Louis Young is standing by in Staten Island at the Castellano home to tell us more. FEMALE NEWSCASTER: Mafia kingpin Paul "Big Paul" Castellano was gunned down gangland-style in midtown Manhattan. The 70-year-old reputed head of the largest and most powerful crime family in the country, the Gambino family... - Uncle Ange. - Mm? - Where's my father? - He'll be here soon. - Is everything okay? - He's okay. Because I heard Paul... RUDOLPH GIULIANI: It would be a terrible mistake to think that, uh, that this is a good time to go around, uh, shooting up people. He's on a jet. He's over Iceland, and the stewardess comes up and she says, "My name is Pussy Galore." (LAUGHTER) He says, "I must be dreaming." (ALL LAUGHING) (CLINKS GLASS) Fellas... We don't know who killed Paul and Tommy. But we're gonna find out. Conduct our own investigation, get to the bottom of this. That being said... our job now is to maintain continuity of leadership. Make sure nobody thinks this family's fallin' apart here. So... I nominate... John Gotti. I second the motion. (APPLAUSE) MAN: To the new boss! - John! - (ALL) Salute! (MEN CHATTERING) Whoa. Hey. (CHUCKLING) Congratulations, John. (SIGHS) How's it feel? Feels like times have changed, and, uh, it's good. I mean how does it feel to be here? This was Neil's joint. It feels right. It feels like it's what he would have wanted. It feels, uh... - Wherever he is, he's watching us. - (HORN HONKS) SAMMY: Yeah. And he ain't the only one. JOHN: I want to talk to you about that. Now, Nick Vilante's widow lives upstairs. We can't kick her out on the street, but... if we have a serious conversation, or it's raining, or it's snowing, we give her a little something, she vacates the premises for 20 minutes and, uh... we take care of her. Yeah, I wish some of these guys would take a walk. Ah... Let 'em know. Let everybody know. Now everybody comes to me. They come to me. - (HIP-HOP PLAYING) - (PEOPLE CLAMORING) MAN: ♪ There's a new boss in town ♪ ♪ Kiss the ring, motherfucker It's my turn now ♪ - John Gotti. - John Gotti. - John Gotti. - John Gotti.

You delivered an envelope to Dominick's wife yesterday. Yeah. I did just like you told me. No, not just like I told you. - I dropped it off. - Who'd you bring with you? - Well, I was gonna bring my niece, but... - But you didn't. You didn't. One simple rule. Don't you ever go to a guy's house while he's away and see his wife alone. And if you ever do this again, I'll park a bus up your ass fuckin' sideways! - You understand that? - Yeah, John.

(KEYS JINGLE) (YELLING) Frankie! Frank! (YELLING) Frank! Frankie! (YELLS) (SIREN WAILING) (HORN BLARING) It was meant for you. - What are you talkin' about? - I am tellin' you, it was... you-know-who did it. I heard it on good authority. He and Gaspipe Casso are like two peas in a fuckin' pod. JOHN: You heard, you heard. Your ears are bigger than your mouth. Okay, first of all, I am friends with Chin. Second, Sam and Pipe go way back. Am I right, Sammy? Oh, and they're all grieving about Paul? Why would they grieve about Paul? Look, whoever... killed Paul did everybody a fuckin' favor. Maybe it was the cops. Uh, you know, they pit us against each other. That's what they want us to believe, am I right? Let's take care of business. JOHN: Angelo tried to take matters into his own hands, with an unsanctioned hit on Gaspipe Casso. That didn't work out too well for nobody. - Gaspipe! - Who the fuck are you? Ahh! (GRUNTS) (PANTING) (ALL CHATTERING) (PANTING) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) JOHN: Good guys, bad guys come in many different colors. New York's finest, serving two masters. (GROANING) (PANTING) (HEAVY DOOR OPENS, SHUTS) I got all day. I got all week. (PANTING) I mean, it's just me and you who are just hanging out in the basement. Just give me a name.

(WHIMPERING) Angelo Ruggiero. Angelo Ruggiero. Thank you. Thank you very much. (SHELL CLATTERS) VINCENT: You handle it. Angelo tried to whack another made guy without permission. JOHN: You got no proof of that. VINCENT: The shooter needed a little encouragement, but he told Gaspipe. He named Angelo. And there's no good reason to disbelieve it. JOHN: Okay, but do I believe everything I hear? No. So I'm gonna do my own investigation on this. VINCENT: Oh, yeah? How's the other investigation goin? Heard anything about Sparks Steak House? (CHUCKLING) Yeah. The Caesar salad is to die for. Angelo's been askin' for this a long time. There's no dispute about that. Let me tell you somethin', Chin. Nobody touches Angelo. Nobody. If it's true that he acted without my approval, I'll put him on the fuckin' shelf like that. (SNAPS FINGERS) I know Angelo's more than a brother to you. But Angelo went off the record. - This was unsanctioned. - Okay, but let me tell you somethin'. The life means more than anything to Angelo. Okay? He's a war horse. It means more than it does to you or to me. (SCOFFS) He wakes up thinking about it, he goes to bed thinkin' about it. If I put him on the shelf for life, it's worse than puttin' a fuckin' bullet through his heart. Then I vote to close this matter. JOHN: The matter's closed. (DOOR LOCK BUZZING) The last time they moved me, John, do you know the only thing I took with me? - Hm? - No. Your indictment. That was it. And do you know why I brought it? Because I don't give a fuck about my cancer. I don't care what they do to me in here. What'll be will be. - My concerns are you. - I know that. I must have read it 50 times, and I tell you, I don't see it. I don't see it. I told you once I'd follow you over a cliff. And I meant it. But I'm thinking about our family now. Your family? What family are you talkin' about? You're talkin' about your 400 brothers, cousins and uncles? Being a man is not being some guy who's looking for closure, John. My freedom and my life take a back seat to my duty and manhood. These are my standards, John. JOHN: Okay, now, listen up. This is important. Never do anyone a small injury. You wanna hurt someone? Hurt him so bad he'll never come back at you. Neil used to say to me, "The boss is the boss is the boss." It ain't titles that honor men. It's men that honor titles. (LOW CHATTER) (DOOR SHUTS) (CHATTER CEASES) (DOOR SHUTS) (SIGHS) Oh, Ange, Ange. What did you do? Ah... I did what I thought was best for you. I saved your life, Ange. That's all I can do. The son of a bitch killed Frank! I'm not goin' to war with the Chin for the sake of Gaspipe fuckin' Casso. I ain't doin' it. Now, listen here. There's ten kinds of shitstorms comin' down on us. And you know what I had to do? We had to have a meetin' with the commission. Why? Because of you. Because of you. Every boss wanted you dead. Every one. You're on the shelf for life. That's it. Go. Go. Go. (DOORBELL RINGS) - Get out of here! - Uncle Ange! He needs you. - He made a big fucking mistake. - Don't say another word. Don't you say one word against your father. You hear me? (VOICE BREAKING) You hear me? (SIGHS) I had to. I can't be treatin' you any differently than I treat everybody else. Now, if I let you violate my rules, the very principles that we live by... it weakens me and it weakens you. Now, one day, you may be the shot caller, you may be the one that's making the rules, and then you would be responsible for enforcing those rules. You know what I'm saying? You gave me the middle name Angelo. How do you expect me to turn my back on him? You pray that I don't know about it. I love him, too. Go to bed. Who cares if he goes to see Angelo? It's not like John's a part of that life. Victoria, please. Don't start. Okay? JUDGE: Will the defendant please rise? Has the jury reached a verdict? JURY FOREMAN: We, the jurors in the above case, find the defendant, John Joseph Gotti, not guilty. - (SCATTERED APPLAUSE) - JOHN: I won this trial fair and square, thanks to a little down payment to one of the jurors. With my third victory over the government, the media nicknamed me "The Teflon Don." I guess it stuck. Mr. Gotti, are you the head of the Gambino crime family? I'm the head of my family. Mrs. Gotti, do you know what your husband does for a living? He provides. (DOOR OPENING) You know why you're here? No. You know everybody in this room? Yes. This is a society of brothers. La Cosa Nostra. You're now about to be inducted as a member of the Gambino family. Honor this oath. If you divulge any secrets of this family, your soul will burn like this saint. You never raise your hands to a made man. If you ever get caught with a made men's wife, you'll be killed. We don't fuck with bombs. We don't endanger civilians. The use of drugs, prohibited. Lastly, and most importantly, we don't like rats. We kill rats. You're questioned by law enforcement? You tell them to go fuck themselves. You are now reborn. This is your baptism. And we're your family. Come here. I'd like you to meet your new soldier. This is your boss, your chief. This is the proudest moment of my life. I'm so fuckin' proud of you. (SIGHS) (LAUGHING) Look at us. Look at us! (SPEAKING SOFTLY IN ITALIAN) (ITALIAN CONTINUES) Ah, Elisa. Now, Johnny. It's like I said, it's gettin' tougher, it's not gettin' easier. You look around you, you got a few good soldiers, am I right? Yeah, Dad, I think you're right. Okay, well, this is not the time to make 20 guys. You know what kind of guys I need? I need guys that do more than just kill. I need guys whose hearts beat the same, otherwise it won't work. And the law is coming down hard on us. You know that. If worse comes to worst we can find you a safe house, get you out of the country. No. I don't run. And I don't hide in shadows, either. You know what I do need? I need one year on the street, uninterrupted. And I will build something that nobody can destroy. A hundred years from now, when we're both dead, it'll still be and continue to be a good thing. It'd be one hell of a legacy to leave. A legacy. Be it an hour from now, be it tonight, be it 100 years from now, when we're gone, it'll be La Cosa Nostra. And I'm not talkin' about gangs, I'm not talkin' about clans, I'm talkin' about New York, Florida, the fuckin' West Coast and back. It's gonna be the way I say it's gonna be. JOHN: About a year after I put him on the shelf, Angelo Ruggiero died of cancer. Ange, I know I hurt you. But you fucked up, and I had to do what was best for the family. Frankly, I think he died of a broken heart. JOHN: By the way, I almost forgot. Sammy thinks that you should be running your own crew now. SAMMY: You paid your dues. You're a credit to your father. Normally I don't show you no favoritism, but this time I'm gonna help you out. I'm gonna handpick your crew. I'm gonna give you Bobby, because I trust him with my life. And I trust him with your life. Is that okay with Bobby? Well, ask him. What? Being under a little punk like you? Madonna mia. My life, huh? You're the skipper now, Bo. You say the word, I'll go over a cliff for you. JOHN: You already are. You're gettin' married. Yeah. Where's Victoria? - Hey, John! - Hey. Good to see ya. - Good to see ya. - Congratulations. Congratulations. Nice work, John. Nice work. Beautiful. Vic! Gotti. How are you? Good to see you. Good to see you.

(NEWS FANFARE PLAYING) "...if you can get away with it." The man some people consider to be organized crime's boss of all bosses, John Gotti, was indicted today for the fourth time in five years. REPORTER: Gotti's charged with the 1985 murder of mob boss Paul Castellano. Prosecutors hope their best testimony this time will come from Gotti's own mouth. JOHN: (ON TAPE) You look at me like I don't know who I am. I am the new boss. I do whatever the fuck I want without steppin' over bounds. Now, I'm tellin' ya, if somethin' happens to me, and I end up in the can, I want Sammy to be the acting boss, is that clear? - Clear. - These are my wishes. (CONTINUING ON TAPE) I'd be a billionaire if I was lookin' to be poor. All I want is this sandwich here. See this sandwich? (OVERLAPPING) Every time I fucking turn around there's a new company. And every time we got a partner... (OVERLAPPING) The boss will fuck with us. We kill him. (OVERLAPPING) That piece of shit. That cocksucker. He's a yellow dog. (OVERLAPPING) I took your word for it, Sam. I allowed it to be done. (EXHALES) (MUTTERING) Son of a fucking... Yeah, your pal, Gravano? He's not gonna be here for breakfast. They took him away late last the night. PROSECUTOR: Please give your name. SAMMY: Salvatore Gravano. PROSECUTOR: Do they call you Salvatore? Sammy. Mr. Gravano, can you please speak into the microphone? Sure. JOHN: I didn't follow my own advice. (PROSECUTOR CONTINUES, INDISTINCT) Never trust anyone who hasn't done time. That's where men are made. Sammy the Bull became Sammy the Rat. The government cut him a deal after admitting to his part in 19 murderers and testifying against me. JUDGE: John Joseph Gotti, you have been convicted on all counts of criminal racketeering, murder and conspiracy. You are hereby remanded to serve a term of no less than five life sentences. You will also be assessed a $50 court fee. Do you have anything to say? (CHUCKLING) Yeah, Your Honor. The five lifetime bits, that's okay, but the $50 surcharge... You really know how to stick it to a guy. (CHUCKLES) MAN ON TV: Today another milestone in the fight against organized crime. The Teflon is gone, the Don is covered with Velcro. And every charge in the indictment stuck. (PEOPLE SHOUTING, CLAMORING) MALE REPORTER: Mayhem outside Brooklyn's Federal Courthouse as John Gotti gets life, and his supporters cry foul. There'll be an appeal and he'll get off 'cause it was very unfair. REPORTER: Demanding a retrial, they rush police lines. They pulled a lot of dirty tricks. And I don't believe their witness. REPORTER: Then try to break into the court to free the Mafia boss. He's a good guy. He does a lot for the community, you know. Put him away for nothin'. REPORTER: After today's arrest, his supporters smashed and overturned cars. The verdict on John Gotti is less likely to be overturned. Law enforcement officials fear that a violent power struggle may happen within Gotti's family. And, ironically, the only one who may be able to keep the peace is John Gotti. JOHN: My loyal crewmember, Eddie Lino, was the first to go down. Bobby Boriello, my closest friend... (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) ...and my son's goombata, was next. That's the life. They understood that. So, what's goin' on? There's a contract out on me. And the rest of Sammy's crew. Who's behind it? Jimmy Brown and Joey Fanatti. Jimmy Brown and Joey Fanatti. Hm. They're out for you too, Johnny. - Why're you so pissed off? - (SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) Tell me! Tell me! I had to read about it! It is on the cover of the paper! - What papers? - That our son is a target. On the Daily News? The fuckin' Post? Since when do they tell the truth? I already buried a son! You want me to bury another, then you will bury me, too. You swore to me, in our own bed, you promised that you would not bring him into that world. What world? What world were you talking about? Tell me the world you're talkin' about. I brought him into this world. You brought him into the life. Aw, come on, shut the fuck up. You don't know what you... Where are you goin? Get back here! Fuck! Look, I'm not gonna beat around the bush. I'm gonna ask you a question, and regarding the answer, one of us is gonna stand down. The chief order this? No, don't play dumb with me! This fuckin' nonsense about Sammy and his crew, is he telling me it came from my father? No. Then I suggest you stand down, my friend. You're prepared to defend these guys? No, I'm prepared to defend my father. Whatever he says goes. Period. Let's get the fuck outta here. MAN ON TV: Five organized crime families, uh, are in a state of flux at this point. New people are moving up to take up the place of the older ones who are now in prison or who have been killed. We've locked up or have under indictment virtually every boss of every family in New York City and throughout the United States. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) You've got to be fuckin' kidding me! What the hell's goin' on? "What's the hell's goin' on?" What do you think's goin' on? Oh, Jesus. Kids, come to Daddy. Come here. I'm gonna be gone for a little while, all right? Don't worry about nothin'. Come here. (SIRENS APPROACHING) (MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) FBI, front door! (SHOUTING) (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Don't worry about Daddy. I'll be back in a little while. WOMAN: We have today unsealed four federal indictments, charging a total of 40 defendants with a widespread pattern of racketeering and other crimes, including multiple extortions, murder conspiracy, - telecommunications fraud... - (TAPPING ON BARS) ...illegal gambling, money laundry and obstruction of justice. The defendants charged include John A. Gotti, uh, also known as Junior, who was alleged to have exercised supervisory control over the Gambino crime family since his father, John J. Gotti, was convicted of federal racketeering charges in 1992. JOHN, JR: These are just bullshit charges. (SLAPS FOLDER ON TABLE) John, there's no way that they can tie you to any of those specific crimes. They don't have to. It's the RICO conspiracy. That's the problem. They just have to prove I'm a member of the enterprise. - We can beat them. - And then what? They just throw more charges at me like they did with my father? I've had enough. I've been pulling back. I'm ready to move on with my life. Are you saying what I think you're saying? All right. John, if that's what you want to do... If you're ready to walk away from this life, I'm happy for you. Just understand there are potential consequences to that decision. And that there are gonna be people out there who are gonna be very unhappy with the decision you make. That's why, Charlie. You need to arrange for me a meeting with my father. It needs to come from me directly. He's dying. He was my cause. Now it's time to move on. I want closure. John, I got no cancer in my brain and I got no cancer in my heart. But what I wouldn't do to have one more time to go into that courtroom and show 'em what a man is, break their holes. You show 'em what a man is. You show 'em what it takes to have this. Now, we only got five minutes left. I don't know when or if I'll ever see you again. And I don't know if I got through to you or not, but I know you got a lot of thinking to do. I know. I miss seeing you, John. You have no idea how much I miss seeing you. You know, this meeting today was worth 55 years hanging upside down. Because now you know how I feel. I love you and adore you. (SIGHS) I know. So... You do what you have to do. And don't worry about me. It doesn't make sense. What'll be will be. You stand up strong, with your head up. Don't cry. Don't let them have the satisfaction. Come on. (SIGHS) - MAN: Scissors. - Yes, sir. What are you looking at me for? You're gonna be here one day too. - Yeah. - (GROANS) - You are beautiful. - That's good. You ever met my wife, Butch? She's beautiful. Why are you fighting this so hard? If you beat this, they're just gonna send you back to solitary. Every day I'm alive is a "fuck you" to the government. You understand? JOHN: My son Peter was at my bedside till the very end. I didn't want Vicky or the girls to see me like that. I made Vicky promise, and she respected my wishes. He's in a lot of pain. I know the morphine's no longer working. Now, we can give him Ativan. Right? It'll induce a coma. He'll be alive, but he won't feel the pain. (GROANS) (SIGHS) I mean... Think about this, Peter. It's your call. - (WEAK, MUFFLED) Peter... - Love you too, Pa. You keep your head up. You be strong. Okay? Promise. I promise. All right. (MAN, DISTANT) Hey, yo, check it out! MALE REPORTER: One of the most high profile mobsters of recent times, John Gotti, died today in a prison hospital in Missouri after a battle with throat cancer. Gotti was known as The Teflon Don or the Dapper Don, a moniker given as a result of his penchant for wearing fancy double-breasted suits. Gotti was acquitted a number of times prior to being sentenced to five consecutive life terms in 1992. John Gotti, dead today at age 61. (♪ WHITTON: "HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN" ♪) ♪ There is a house in New Orleans ♪ ♪ They call the Rising Sun ♪ Everybody here knows that he was a great man.

They say you win this time, but next time they will make sure that you don't. This is bullshit! A hundred more fuckin' years? - John... - You gotta be fuckin' kidding me! - Calm down. - No! My father told me they would never let me go. He told me that! They wanna fight the legacy of John Gotti? Then let them fight John Gotti! We'd like to believe that a trial in its purest form is a search for the truth. But a search for the truth requires a willingness to see the truth. Yesterday, the prosecutor spoke to you about what he perceived to be the courage of his witnesses. Well, the truth is, sneaking up behind someone and shooting them in the head is not an act of courage. It's an act of deception, it's a display of treachery, and it's a demonstration of a cold-blooded willingness to put their own interests above that of anyone else, regardless of the consequences. Contrast that with the courage required of John, who, admittedly, was in that life... but who paid for his crimes with many years in prison. But John had the courage to walk away from that life. The courage to tell his dying father, to whom the life was everything, that his obligations were to his family, not to a crime family. The reality is John left the life on his terms. Cooperation in return for a reduced sentence? No, thanks. He said "I'll do my own time for my own crimes." In 11 years since then, the government has spent millions of taxpayer dollars - in five prosecutions. - (CHAINS CLANKING) They shipped John all across the country, under the most horrible conditions, in what they jokingly refer to as "diesel therapy." But in the end, they could not provide even a single credible allegation of any contact between John and the enterprise. Once again, the government just refuses to see the truth. When the government goes off the rails, driven by ego and obsession, it's incumbent upon its citizens to guide the government back on course. In this system, in this courtroom, you, the jury, are the conscience of the government. It's time to do the right thing. Send him home. Send him home to his wife and his kids. Send him home to live the life he chose to live. He's earned it. JOHN: The government tried hard to break Johnny Boy, but my son took 'em to task. Five trials in 37 months, and the government walked away with nothin'. (DOOR SLAMS) Listen to me, and listen to me good. You're never gonna see another guy like me, if you live to be 5,000.
