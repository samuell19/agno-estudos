-Just like I said, huh? Green and white truck parked under the bridge. Nobody around, right? -Yeah, just like you said. -Gee, I'm glad I did such a good job. Take a look. Well, we'll have to have a date to-- maybe you'll give me the $1,000 like you said you would, huh? -Roger wants $1,000. -Let him have it. -Hey, this is only $50. -We took out the withholding tax. -Wait a minute. -Wait for what? -Hey, maybe I could have one of them color sets? -Sure, why not? -More than $50. [GLASS SHATTERS] -Gee, that one sounds broken. You gotta take better care of your stuff, Roger. [MUSIC PLAYING] [FRIDGE DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] -Colette? Colette? Colette? Collette! [WHISTLES] -Hi, sweetie. [WHISTLES] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] -Who is it? ROGER: Come on, Sergeant, it's me. I gotta talk to you about something [INAUDIBLE]. -What the hell are you doing here? -Surprised, huh? -How'd you find out where I live? -Hey, I can't give away my sources. Listen, Brogan, it's all set for 8:30, OK? -OK, I'll see you. -Where's the money? -Wait there. There. $250. [DOG BARKING] -And don't come back here anymore. It's a respectable neighborhood. --[INAUDIBLE] because I found out you live as crummy as I do. -Roger, nobody lives as crummy as you. [MUSIC PLAYING] WATCH SELLER: Hey, Brogan, you like my watch? ALEX BROGAN: You call that a watch? WATCH SELLER: A beautiful watch. -That's a piece of junk. Now, here's a watch. Remember, every watch has got a long story behind it. This is a [INAUDIBLE] watch. This comes with a guarantee not to wear, tear, wrinkle, or shrink. Your money back in 30 days. WATCH SELLER: Is that so? ALEX BROGAN: That's right. You'll never get stuck with this, you know, no matter what happens. [INAUDIBLE]. -You trying to make a fool out of me in front of everyone? -[INAUDIBLE]! -Hey, lay off me [INAUDIBLE]! -Stop! [PEOPLE CONTINUE SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER] -Hey! Hey, Marco. Que pasa? -Hey, nada, man, nada. Do you want some candy? -Oh, no, no, thank you. Thank you just the same. What's happening? -There's some very big things coming out, you know? -Oh, yeah? Like what? -Listen, this one going to make all the newspapers. -Well, I hope they spelled your name right. -Ain't no names, man. What are you, crazy? You can't use names. -Oh, oh, I was just kidding. -You can't kid in this business. -You're right, you're right. -I have a very big deal coming, you know? -A big what? -A big deal coming down. -Uh-huh. -And I can use an extra guy. -Uh-huh. -So I can cut you in for a piece of the action. -A what? -For a piece of the action. -Oh, that's good. Thank you. Thank you very much. -Yeah. We are friends, eh? -Sure. --[INAUDIBLE], I'm going to see you later, huh? -Uh-huh. OK, Marco. Whatever you do, watch yourself now. Don't take no chances. -You know me, man. I am very careful. -You what? Who? Well, you know where to find me. -Take your lousy hands out of my butts, you little rat. -Oh, shove it, Sylvia, I don't need your stupid cigarettes or you either. -Ah, go on, get lost. -Oh, go to hell. -These kids nowadays. So Marco, where have you been? -Oh, I've been very busy at the office. -Oh, yeah. Too busy to see an old girlfriend. [MEN TALKING AND LAUGHING IN BACKGROUND] -Oh! [INAUDIBLE]. -Well, you got it? -What I ain't got is your money. -Oh, yeah. Here it is. Comes to $250, right? POOL HALL OWNER: Hey, Sylvi! Come here! -Watch your bum. -Show Roger here-- -10 bags, pure gold. -You're pure, now. POOL HALL OWNER: Like Sylvi's heart. -Hope it don't kill nobody. -One thing I can't stand is a pusher. I run a respectable pool hall. -Well, the thing about you, I always know when the conversation is over. -Get out of here. ALEX BROGAN: Freeze, it's the cops! Everybody! [PEOPLE GASP] --[INAUDIBLE] or I'll blow your brains out. -Brogan, you better have a warrant is all I gotta say. Ain't no violation here, man. -Don't talk to me about violations. You're in this up to your neck. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Bah! -Take it easy. It's only me. -Oh, man, you know I can't take that, man. -Who does? But it sure beats shoveling [INAUDIBLE]. MARCO: I guess so. -Where's the stuff? -I show you. Do you know, I never done nothing like this before, huh? And I swear to you, I ain't going to do it again. But all this, man. -Mm-hm. Hey, that's great. -Listen, you don't mind I kept, you know, one ring for myself. I mean, it's not for myself, but it's for this girl, Maria. You know, she's from Asbury Park. -It's OK, it's OK. You worked hard. You deserve it. -All right. That's real, huh? What do you think? -Hey, she's a lucky girl. -OK, Marco, now hold it right there. Marco! [GUNSHOTS] ALEX BROGAN: Marco! Marco! -I tried to stop. He just ran out. -All you wanted was that stinking bag. What did you shoot for? -I didn't shoot him. I shot the ceiling. -But you scared him. -He was born scared. -The brakes is good on this truck. I just had them checked. ALEX BROGAN: Well, don't worry about it. He's a small-time creep. He's nothing. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You sure he's there now? -Come on, give me the money. I don't need anymore aggravation from you. Suddenly, you don't trust me? -Suddenly, I never did. Here. This is $7,500 of police department money. You screw me on this-- -I know, I know, you'll break my spine. I won't be able to walk again. You know how many years you've been telling me that? -Someday you're going to be no more good to me, and it's going to happen. -Just like Marco, huh? -Go on, get going with the money. Set up Lattimore. -Stick with me, I'll make you a hero. -Just set him up. I'll make me a hero. -Don't worry. Lattimore's one of my best friends. -Like Marco, huh? Come on, get going. -Mr. Lattimore? -Roger, nice of you to get here so promptly. ROGER: I got the money. But there's something I want to tell you, Mr. Lattimore. ALEX BROGAN: Well, what happened? -I gave him the money. I him in a few minutes, my friend will be up. That's you. -I know that's me. What floor is he on? -In the back on the third floor. -All right. You wait here. -Hey, I want my $100! -When I bring him back in handcuffs. -How about half of it now. -What's a matter? Suddenly you don't trust me? [LIVELY JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] [SMOOTH JAZZ PLAYING] PLANE CAPTAIN: Captain [INAUDIBLE], ladies and gentlemen. This is your pilot, Captain [INAUDIBLE]. I'd like to welcome you to [INAUDIBLE] Flight 6 to Miami. We're cruising at an altitude of 24,000 feet. Latest weather advisory for Miami-- [INAUDIBLE] very pleasant [INAUDIBLE]. We're to arrive on schedule at 8:30 PM local time. Please sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] -May I help you? -I'd like to have a red convertible. -Oh, we don't rent convertibles anymore. I could give you a red Mustang. -That's what I said, a red Mustang. -Very good. Could I have your driver's license and credit cards? -Oh, driver-- oh, how do you like that? I changed my suit today, and I put on another jacket, so I-- -I'm afraid that without a valid driver's license, we can't rent you a car. -I thought you would. You must have a license. Why don't you drive me around? I'll show you a fantastic evening, and I'll pay for the car. -I'm sorry, sir. We really can't help you. Why don't you try number two? -Why don't you try me? -[SCOFFS] Why don't you give up? -Are you for hire? CAB DRIVER: This is Miami. Everything's for hire. ROGER: So what's the closest hotel you've got around here? -Well, welcome to Miami. So, eh, you're meeting your husband down here, huh? -No. ROGER: Oh, you're engaged. -No. -Don't get the wrong idea. These are just the clothes I work in. I'm from Texas. The oil business, you know. Filthy down there. Dirt, grime, mud, yuck. What kind of work do you do? You believe in fate? Me, I believe in fate. Would you believe I've got nothing to do tonight? -I believe it. [MUSIC PLAYING] [TRIUMPHAL TRUMPETS PLAYING] -Yes? -Roger, uh, Smith. North New Jersey. -He hasn't checked in yet. -Wait a minute. Eh, I'm Roger Smith. So that's the ocean. That's right. That's the ocean. [TRANQUIL MUSIC PLAYING] --[SIGHS DEEPLY] Brogan, eat your heart out. HARRY: So don't tell me about any trips to Miami. Alex, without authorization, you let some [INAUDIBLE] take off with $7,500 of the department's money, not to mention your own car. -I found my car, Harry. I told you. [INAUDIBLE] airlines parking lot. That's how I figured him for Miami. The clerks remembered the face. -I don't think I can even keep your job for you now. -20 years I put in. 20 years, never let anything like this happen to me. What do you mean, my job? -Look at it this way, with one stroke, you wiped out the department's entire contingency fund for this year's budget. There's no money left for fancy manhunts! -That's grand larceny, Harry. It's grand larceny. -It's grand stupidity, Brogan, and it ain't his. It ain't his! I'm going to fight for you, Alex. -Oh, I'll fight for me. Just give me the leave, no expenses. I don't get to have time. It's no egg on your face. If I don't bring the money back, you can keep the badge. -The report has to be in to the commissioner by next Friday. -All right. A week's leave. I'll see you next Friday. HARRY: Brogan! How are you going to find him in a big town like Miami? -Harry, you ever smell Roger Pitman? -[LAUGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hello, honey, what's happening? -[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Say, uh, you look like you could use some help. -Oh, thanks. -You're lucky, because I just took a course this morning in suntan oiling. As a matter of fact, right now, I happen to be an expert on the subject. -Hey, that's nice. Hey, would you undo the strap? -Certainly. -Mmm. That feels good. -Oh, I haven't even started yet. You know, usually, I start on the front. You know, I'm a real expert in rubbing people's fronts. -Maybe you'd like to rub mine, huh? GAS STATION ATTENDANT: How long did it take you to drive down here from New Jersey? -Oh, about 12 to 13 hours. -No kidding. Boy, them new highways sure smooth it out, don't they? -Yeah, I was surprised. -[LAUGHS] Must have a good car. Keep it up. You got a good [INAUDIBLE] back there? -[INAUDIBLE]. You know, it stops running, I'll get another one. -Well, that's one way to do it. Ride it like an Apache rides a horse just to stop. [LAUGHS] -[LAUGHS] -You know, my cousin Junior's got one like this. He's had a little trouble with his wiring. Want me to check your oil? -No, I'm, uh-- no, maybe you better. Go ahead. -Trying to remember what it was that caused Junior's trouble. I remember, we was in here all of one Fourth of July working on the damn thing. She running all right just now? -Why? Did she need some oil? -Try and start it up for me, will you? [CAR ENGINE DOESN'T TURN OVER] -You know, I think you're damn lucky to get as far as you did. I think your distributor just plain burned out. You smell anything out there? -No. I mean, it's always smelled. -No wonder, then. -Hey, look, I gotta get back on the road. How long to fix this thing? -Well, not long. About 15 minutes. -Good. -Course, I gotta get that part. I bet ol' Charlie's done gone home. He's down in Leonard about 15 miles. -Well, would you call him, please? -OK. -Well, I got some good news for you. It's coming on the Greyhound in the morning. That's the last one Charlie had, too. You're damn lucky. -What the hell do I do now? -Well, you could stay here overnight or hitch-hike. I'm sure sorry about that. Hey, listen, I got some nice rooms in the back, real reasonable. It's off season. -Where can I get a drink? -Oh, there's Floyd's place down the road a piece. -I'll be back. How far? ALEX BROGAN: Oh, about 23 miles down the road in Palmer County. [INAUDIBLE]. WOMAN SINGER: [SINGING "BESAME MUCHO"] Dearest one, if you should leave me, this little dream would take wing, and my life would be through. Besame. Besame mucho. Love me forever. Make all my dreams come true. -Yeah? -What does "besame mucho" mean? -Beat it, creep, or I'll call my boyfriend. -Everybody's got a boyfriend. -Hey, Mr. Smith. Seeing how the other half lives, right? -I know how the other half lives. -Striking out with the ladies? -Some women got rotten personalities, that's all. -Sometimes you run into the wrong elements. It's nobody's fault. Look, let me give you an address. This is a nice place. They got a good show. There's a nice room in there, give you a lot of laughs, make you feel at home, OK? -And I've got a message for you. (SINGING) You've got your own life to live, your own mistake to make. Right or wrong, you're my friend. That's a chance you've gotta take. You've gotta do it yourself, where there's something to do, because nobody, nobody's gonna do-- you're doing for you. You've gotta get out and swing. Now, you, you must do your own thing, because you've got your own life to live. Now let me tell you something. Did you ever say to yourself, I wish I had my life to live over again? Did you? Well, honey, all you have to do is get up tomorrow morning and start living your life, start living your life like you want to live it, like-- not like anybody tells you how to live it. Do your own thing, do it for yourself, and be happy about it. As long as you don't hurt anybody, don't let anybody stop you. You can accomplish anything in this world if you live your life the way you should. Right on! (SINGING) You've got your own life to live, c'mon, your own mistake you make. Shake it up. Right or wrong, my friend. And that's a chance you've gotta take. You've gotta do it yourself when there's something to do, because nobody-- everybody, clap your hands. Come on now, let's hear it. [TRANQUIL MUSIC PLAYING] -You thinking about jumping? -I was just going to ask you the same thing. -Looks too cold. -I can't swim. -I wonder if they brought in some decorator from New York to paint that sunrise. It can't be real. Nothing else here is. -Are you here on vacation, too? -Some vacation. ROGER: Every guy you meet is just a creep who wants to go to bed with you, right? -Wrong. -Wrong? -Not one person's asked me. I mean, not that I'm looking for it, you know, but it would be nice if somebody tried. I mean, a girl likes to know she's desired. -Would you like to go to bed with me? [CHUCKLES] I thought so. -Oh, hey, listen, I mean, it's nothing personal. I just don't jump into the sack with the first guy that comes along. You know what I mean? And listen, I don't even know your name. -Oh, Roger Pitman. From Weehawken, New Jersey. -Sheila Morrison, Hempstead, Long Island. -Nice to know you. -I'm sorry if I insulted you, Roger. -Oh, no, no, you didn't insult me. I've been insulted by experts. -It's just that, you know, I saved up for this whole year. And I guess, I don't know, I thought somebody like Cary Grant or somebody was going to come along and sweep me off of my feet. [SIGHS] -Hey, I'll tell you what. I happen to have a whole free day today. Why don't we get together? There must be something more to do in this town than just lay around like a dead horse and roast like a turkey. -[LAUGHS] There is. There are lots of beautiful places. I've been to them. -Well, maybe you could show me around. -OK. You got a date. -It's about time. -What do I owe you? -Well, let's see. Now, that's-- for the room and for the repairs, that's-- yeah, and there's breakfast, so that's-- well, let's just call it $28 even. Hey, how'd you like that bacon? Wasn't that good? We got our own pigs out there in the back. -Great. That's great. -Say, you never did tell me what line of work you're in. -I'm a police officer. -Isn't that a coincidence? -I'm coming through here after a guy who stole some money. -Oh, that's bad. I hope you catch them. If there's anything I can't stand, it's a thief. Way worse than an egg-eating dog. -See ya. [MUSIC PLAYING] ROGER: It's funny. I-- I really don't even know what to say to you. SHEILA: Say anything. Just be yourself. ROGER: I wish I knew what myself is. I feel like I'm so happy about all this, but somehow, at the same time, I-- I feel like I want to run away. SHEILA: Do I make you want to run away? ROGER: Oh, it's not you. It's me. I don't know. For some reason, nothing-- nothing seems to work out for me. I'm afraid to get excited about anything, because somehow, nothing comes of it. Everything I touch, I ruin. SHEILA: Yeah. I've been feeling the same way lately. ROGER: You too? How come? SHEILA: Well, I-- I just went through one of those futile relationships, and I got hurt. ROGER: Wow. No kidding. What happened? Tell me about it. SHEILA: Well, there's really nothing to tell you. It's over. ROGER: Oh. Do you miss him? SHEILA: No. I don't miss him. I-- I miss that feeling of being in love with somebody. ROGER: Hm. I know what you mean. Life can be pretty empty without that kind of feeling. SHEILA: Tell me something about yourself, Roger. ROGER: Oh, there's nothing in my life that's really worth talking about. SHEILA: Come on, you're just being modest. ROGER: [CHUCKLES] Listen, I don't want to tell you too much about myself. I'd hate to lose you so early in this relationship. SHEILA: Hey, wait a minute. I thought girls were supposed to play games like that. You talk like you're a shady criminal or something. ROGER: It's not a very different person than you think. SHEILA: You put on a false front, but I don't think that's the real you. ROGER: You mean I'm a phony? SHEILA: No, I don't mean that. I mean, you hide behind the front. Everybody does that. -You think everybody does? -Yeah, I do. -I never thought of that. -Actually, I think you're a very sincere person. -But what if the phony layer on the outside is really real, and down inside is the phony part? [LAUGHS] [COP CAR SIREN BLARES] [THUNDER] -Officer, I'm in a very big hurry. I-- -Papers. -Yeah. I'm a-- I'm a police officer myself. I'm traveling through here in the line of duty. -Yeah, you're traveling in a damn big hurry through Clinton County. -Oh, I'm sorry about that. I'm down here after a fugitive from justice. -See your badge. -Yeah. Oh, I, uh, I left that back in my office. See, this is a confidential case. -It's so confidential, people might not see you for about 10 years. [INAUDIBLE]. -No trouble at all, you hillbilly jackass. Now, get your chief on that radio. I want to talk to somebody in authority. -You're talking to the chief. That's 80 miles an hour in a 50-mile zone, [INAUDIBLE], impersonating a police officer. One year, two maybe. Six months off with good behavior. But you ain't showing too much of it up to now. -What about a trial? -Sure, you can have a trial tonight, tomorrow maybe, maybe next week, you know how it goes. The judge, he's off fishing. -Can I call my office? -There ain't no phone out here, boy. -Look, suppose I give you the fine that I'd owe the court. Say $60, and maybe you could give it to the judge for me, OK? -You better make that about $75. That judge an ornery man. -$75. -Well, seeings you's a police officer, I won't be holding you up. [THUNDERS] -OK, Roger, that's it. RACETRACK ANNOUNCER: And they're off. And the winner is number two. SHEILA: How much is that? -A little over $1,000. -Roger, where does all this money come from? -I stole it. Oh, well, that explains it. [HONKY TONK MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] SHEILA: I admire your honesty, Roger, but you're really being too hard on yourself. -Sheila, you don't understand. I really am a hustler. I'm trying to be straight with you like I've never been straight with anybody before. -Excuse me. -I'm telling you the truth. -Look, if you think you're making yourself more glamorous to me or something by hinting that you're some underworld figure, you don't have to. What's glamorous to me is that you're very warm and giving. -Sheila, God probably is-- -Excuse me. -Probably what? [BOTH LAUGH] -Excuse me. -Is that all we get? -No, you're supposed to taste that. -Oh. Hey, that is very good. What is that? -That's beef stroganoff. -It looks like stewed noodles. That is very good stewed noodles. -[LAUGHS] Probably what? -You're probably the most beautiful girl in Miami Beach, that's all. -Do you wanna come in? -Sure. -That always happens. -Would you like me to help you? So, uh, this is your room. I never thought I'd get a chance to see it. -Well, this is it. -Nice, uh, to be here. I feel that you have a nice body. -I do. -Mm-hm. -Nobody ever told me that before. -I mean it. -I'm glad. -You do love me, don't you, Roger? -Of course I do. And I never loved anybody else. Not even me. That's the truth. -I believe you. What's going to happen, Roger? -Nothing but good things, honey. Nothing but good. -Looks like kind of a cross between a Jew and a Puerto Rican. -Yeah, I see what you mean. -Well, why don't you let me make a couple of dozen copies of this mug shot, circulate it around to various hotels. -Yeah, anything that'll help. -Understand, we wouldn't want to get in the way of an officer from one of those big Northern police departments. This is your show. But I was wondering, maybe you could teach some of my boys a thing or two. -I'd be happy to, chief. Any time. -Oh, good. You know, like, how you could talk your department into letting you give $7,500 to a guy with a face like that. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] ROGER: Say, how did you find this place? SHEILA: I read about it in a guide book. ROGER: Oh, you read those things? SHEILA: Yeah, when you're a legal secretary, you learn to do research on everything. ROGER: You did a good job. This is some place. Say, who is that? She looks a lot like you. -That's Venus. She's my patron saint, except she keeps passing me by. ROGER: What do you mean, she passes you by? I love you. SHEILA: Oh, Roger. ROGER: What do you mean, oh, Roger? -Look, I'm a big girl. I mean, I understand. -What the hell are you talking about? -I mean, we had a wonderful time last night and everything, but I don't have any illusions. -Don't you understand what it is when something happens between two people? What do you think happened last night? Was it just an accident? Just because you're too shy to admit it, don't think I don't know what it meant to you. I know what it meant to you. And I know what it means to me. I wanna marry you. -You wanna marry me? -I said that? I guess I do. -Well, you know something? I accept. -[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] [SIGHS] ROGER: How did I get involved? [ROGER HAPPILY SINGING] -[GASPS] -Surprise. -Look, Alex, I could explain the whole-- Ah! -Don't be giving me that Alex crap. Just give me the money. [ROGER GROANS] -That's $200. [COUNTS UNDER HIS BREATH] 500, 28. OK. Where's the rest? Where is it? Where is it! -It's gone. -You didn't? You didn't. -Ah. ALEX BROGAN: My money, my pension, my career on fancy hotel rooms and a bunch of dogs. My whole life down the toilet. I'm going to kill you! [INSISTENT KNOCKING AT DOOR] -Roger! -Who are you? -Roger! -I'm a police officer! Who are you? -I'm a friend of his. -No! Roger! [CRYING] No! Roger! What happened to you? --[INAUDIBLE] what happened, schmuck. Come on, you pig! Tell me what's been going on! -No! Leave him alone. No. -This man's a fugitive from the Weehawken police. He's a known criminal with a long record. On Monday last, he stole $7,500 from an officer and police force, namely me, me! Do you get it now, miss? Do you get it? I know this must be a shock to you. -No, it isn't. He told me. I just didn't want to hear it. -So help me. --[GROANING IN PAIN AND PANTING] This is for you. ALEX BROGAN: I'll take that ring. -That's hers. I paid $1,800 for it. -You paid $1,800? You paid, huh? You paid? -Good morning. May I, uh-- oh, nice to see you again, Mr. Smith. -It's Pitman, and he's a thief. I just picked him up. Now, uh, he bought this ring here, uh, yesterday, Roger? -Yeah. -I am deeply shocked. Is this true, Mr., uh-- -Guess so. -Well, anyway, the money belongs to the people. He stole it from a public agency. And he'll return the ring and get the money back. -I beg your pardon, but are you with the Miami Beach police force? -No, I'm not, but I am a police officer, and I just want the money back for the ring. -Well, may I see your badge? -Well, uh, when we travel, we, uh, we leave them at headquarters, so they won't get stolen. -Then? -I do have my ID card. -Weehawken, New Jersey. This man is from New Jersey as well? ALEX BROGAN: That's correct. -Then the alleged theft wasn't even committed in Florida. -Sure in hell spent the money here. -We have a firm policy on such matters. ALEX BROGAN: That's hot money. -We dealt in good faith, Sergeant, uh, Brogan. -Look, you, I'll get a court order. -Fine. You do that. Then we'll talk some more. Of course, there is one alternative. I could, uh, out of my own pocket, really, give you, oh, say, $600 for the ring. -All right. I'll take it for now. I'm coming back with a court order. -No, you'll sign a release for the $600 first. -Could you make it $1,000? -Not a chance. ALEX BROGAN: Conned out of $1,200. The bum in here is a thief. SHEILA: So why don't you arrest him? -Ralphie! -What? -My cousin Ralphie. We used to go swimming together when we were kids. -Oh? -He moved out here years ago, opened up a whole [INAUDIBLE] of fried chicken joints and [INAUDIBLE]. He's got nothing but money. -Well, why didn't you say so? Let's go. Where can we drop you off, miss? -What do you mean, miss? -Oh, come on, for old time's sake. Don't you know where we used to go swimming together? -The only swimming I remember is when you pushed me in the Harlem River. I got pneumonia and damn near died! -Oh, Ralphie. -Don't call me Ralphie! I detest that name. -Gee, I'm sorry. Listen, Ralph, gee, I always thought of you as Ralphie all these years. -Do I look like a Ralphie to you? -Oh, no, you look terrific. Listen, please, what would it mean to you, a lousy $7,000? After all, you got this big house. -And I didn't get it from listening to bums like you! -Gee, Ralphie-- uh, Ralph, my Aunt Gladys, your mother, she would turn over in her grave if she heard this. -My mother wrote you off when you were arrested the first time. How old were you then, Roger? 15? -Gee, Ralph, please. Please, Ralph. -Here. See yourself out. -Jesus, Roger, you couldn't get laid at an orgy. Look at the gas we used up. -Oh, he tried, Brogan, didn't he? What do you want from him? -Turned down by his own flesh and blood. Gee. SHEILA: It all sounds very reasonable. I'll go and tell my friend. MRS. BUTLER: Thank you. SHEILA: Thank you. -How much? -$5 a night. -Good. -Beggars can be choosers. -Get the bags. SHEILA: Mrs. Butler, this is Mr. Brogan. MRS. BUTLER: Very please to meet you, I'm sure. ALEX BROGAN: Me too, ma'am. MRS. BUTLER: These are the two front rooms. I think they're very nice. Is there another gentleman? -Yeah, but he's bringing up the bags. -Is this your first trip to Miami? -Uh-huh, yes, it is. -That's nice. These rooms connect. You'll find it very clean. -Oh, my god, let me help you. -It's OK, honey, I got it. I'm fine. Thanks, however. [BREATHING HEAVILY] -Oh, Mrs. Butler, this is Mr. Pitman. -How do you do? -Oh, how do you do, ma'am? -You all have a nice time now. -Thank you very much. -Ah, that's more like it, huh? Give me my bag. Excuse me, miss. -That's it! -What's it? -What do you got? -Hey, this is none of your business. I'll do this alone. -Get me the money, pal. -Give me my $100. -Your $100? -Come on, I've got work to do. -Now what are you up to? -Give me my jacket. -Listen, don't you get into more trouble because of him? -We can't get into any more trouble than we are now. -I don't know about that. -Look, just lock yourself in this room, and don't go anyplace till I get back. -Hey, she stays here with me. -What? -To be sure you'll come back, that's why. -Now, listen here, Brogan. -No, you listen, Pitman. Now, I told you once before. -Hey, wait a minute. -Well, it's about time you [INAUDIBLE]. [INTERPOSING VOICES] -She stays here with me! -By 6 o' clock. -What? -I said I'll make dinner, and it will be ready at 6 o'clock, OK? -Oh, you cook, too? -Oh, it's all off if I can? -Good god. -OK, I like this one. I'll take it. How much? -Run you $75 plus tax. You want some shells? -Shells? -Ammunition. Bullets for the gun. -Oh, bullets. That's important. Yes. -Box? -Please. How do you work this thing? -You push that button there, and the clip flies out, you see? Then you take your shell and kind of torque her in there. Then you just ram her home. ROGER: Is that all? -Well, you don't know much about guns, do you? -Well, it depends. I know a lot about the-- -Uh-huh. Yeah, it all depends. Just pull the slide back. Now she's cocked and ready. ROGER: Right now? GUN SHOP OWNER: Right now. -I hate to do this, but I got a problem. -Boy, I'd hate for you to do it, because you've got a bigger problem than you think. -Now, put your hands up and give me the money. -Go ahead. Shoot. Do it. Do it, do it! -Don't think I won't. Give me the money. -Give you the money? I got the money. [LAUGHS] Give it to you? I got it. $100, including tax a ammunition. Boy, you picked up the wrong gun. That one's not loaded. -I know this is the right gun. Give me the money. GUN SHOP OWNER: All right. Prove it, shoot me. Shoot! See, you picked up the wrong gun, boy. This is the loaded one. You picked up the wrong one. Now, put your hands up and put it down. Come on, boy, before I get angry. Come on! Now, you hang right there, boy, while I make me a little phone call. -Hey, I told you, boy. [GUN CLICKS] -Oh, my god. [SHEILA SINGING] -Come on, you pig. Where is it? My money, where is it? I'm going to kill you! SHEILA: Come on, stop it. -I need that money now. ROGER: I don't know what to do here. I don't know anybody. ALEX BROGAN: Poke around. Worm the woodwork. Dig out the garbage. Check in the gutters. You do what you always do. You find the action. -I can't stand it anymore. Is it always going to be one more rotten deal? Doesn't it ever stop? Listen, he told you he's sorry. He's given you back the money, and you keep going and going at him. What's the matter with you? Don't you have any compassion? ALEX BROGAN: Listen, miss, don't tell me about compassion. Where's your compassion for my $7,500? This is going to be his neck, not mine. ROGER: Hey, wait a minute. I've got a fantastic idea. I've got the answer to the whole problem. BANKER: Well, now, let me get this straight. You're self-employed with no regular income. -Right. BANKER: You are not a resident of Miami. -Right. -You have no credit references. -Right. -And you want to borrow $7,000? -Right. -I'm sorry. I just can't believe the bank would approve a loan like that. -But I'll pay it back. -Look, I'm sure you will. But unfortunately, we have had experiences from time to time. -I promise you. -Now, if you only had some collateral or a co-signer. -What's a collateral? -Well, collateral is some piece of property or a security, stocks, a car. -But if I had all that, why would I need the money? -I don't know. -What's that other thing you mentioned? -A co-signer? That's someone who will sign the loan with you. Then if you don't pay, they will. It should be a person with a steady income, a good credit rating, a solid member of the community. -I have just the right person for that. -Oh, good. -Co-sign for a bank loan with you, you, Roger Pitman? -I'll pay you back. -Jesus. Talk about chutzpah. Well, you don't give up, do you? You want to screw me out of the same money twice, huh? I'll tell you one thing. My estimation of you has gone up 1,000 to 10. Jesus. What an imagination. What is it with you? Are you crazy? -What do you mean I'm crazy? You're crazy. -Hey, stop it, guys. Come on, stop it! Don't start now. Let's have a nice meal in peace, huh? You gotta admit he's trying, Brogan. -He's trying. -How 'bout some iced tea? -Hey, that's great. You're a nice girl, Sheila. -Hey, Roger, how come a nice girl like that falls for an armpit like you? -To tell you the truth, I'm afraid to ask her. Hey, these are some great steaks. -I'll tell you something, Roger, you get out of this mess, you marry that girl, you're going to wind up a fat man. -Just let me, that's all. -Up to you. -OK. Go away. I gotta cook. -Brogan, how would you get that much money if you had to? -Honestly? Well, I don't know any honest ways, not that kind of money. -And how do you expect Roger to cough it up? -Sheila, please. -What? -Don't make an issue. -Well, I, uh, I thank you for a nice dinner. I have to get some rest. See you in the morning. Oh. Don't go anywhere without telling me, huh? -Don't worry, we won't. -Good night. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Don't be so depressed. -What do you mean, don't be so depressed? Did you see him walking up and down here like a tiger. The man is going to tear me apart. Listen, honey, let's face it. I'll have to go to jail. There's no other way out. -Well, for how long? -Maybe 10, 15 years. -Nope. Nope. I waited too long for you to come along, and I can't spare you now. They're just going to have to get used to it. So don't worry. -Don't worry. [MUSIC PLAYING] ROGER: Maybe we'll have one of those, uh, one of those boat places where people will come to us-- fishing and sailing. [LAUGHTER] SHEILA: How can we have a boat place? You don't even like to go out into the sun. ROGER: Yeah. Well, maybe we'll just have an awning on the boat, that's all. [LAUGHTER] SHEILA: Did you ever drive a boat? ROGER: No, I never did, but it has to be a lot easier than driving a car. [LAUGHS] After all, in the ocean, there's no traffic light. SHEILA: You're nuts, Roger. ROGER: That would be so great for the kids, too. They'll play on the boats, and they'll all have a beautiful tan. -What kid? -Our kids. -Roger, you're so crazy. And you're so sweet. I love you so much. -You really do, don't you? -Listen to this. "The illegal drug traffic continues to grow despite recent raids by the local police and cooperation with the Bureau of Narcotics. Spokesmen for the Bureau indicate that an internal struggle within the syndicate is taking place on the docks. Rival gangs are flooding the market with heroin in an attempt to drive the street prices down." That should interest you, Roger. -What's he talking about? -Listen, honey, this problem is not going to just go away. I've got to get the money someplace. -You know what the syndicate is? They make Roger here look like Saint Jude. Stealing from them isn't even like stealing. -Stealing is stealing. -Come on. Let's go. [UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] -What are you doing? -I want to get a pack of butts. -Hey, Roger, look at this. -What? ALEX BROGAN: Right there. I think we got something. -What are you talking about? ALEX BROGAN: Watch. There's the pick-up. That's the money. Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Let's go. -Shouldn't we get some help, like the Miami police? -It's a reward out. Who wants to split a thing like this? Listen, this can help your boyfriend. -Oh, don't give me that. If you really wanted to help him, you could just let him go. -That's not a bad idea. -Hey, [INAUDIBLE] for $7,500, so wake up. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] SHEILA: Brogan, I'm scared. ALEX BROGAN: Welcome to the club. -Hey, Brogan. (WHISPERING) Don't hurt nobody. -Shut up. ALEX BROGAN: [INAUDIBLE]. Put the bag down. There. Put your hands behind your head. Now turn around. [STRUGGLING NOISES] -Where's the guy? Brogan, why didn't you arrest him? What did you do back there? -Look, he said he was putting on weight, so I took his groceries. Shut up. Ooh. $2,000. SHEILA: You took his money. -It's not his money. It's anybody's money. -You stole it! -Oh-ho-oh. Oh, my god. Get the tape in the glove compartment. Give me the tape. -What are you doing? -We can sell this back in Weehawken for 15 big ones. ROGER: You're supposed to be a cop. Doesn't that badge mean anything to you? ALEX BROGAN: My badge is back in Weehawken. -What, that cuts your obligation, huh? -Will you stop that holy, holy crap? I'm not the first cop with a load of horse in his car. -What the hell is happening to you? -I don't know, but I'm not going along with this. ALEX BROGAN: Well, to hell with you. I'll sell it myself. Come on, Mr. and Mrs. Pure Heart. [TRANQUIL MUSIC PLAYING] -I'm going to drop you two off. And he's off the hook. I'll sell this stuff back in Jersey and put in for retirement. Now listen, let me give you and Sheila something. Here's $100. -I don't want it. -Go ahead. Take it, it's a wedding present. -I don't want it. -Hey Roger! Roger, will you come here? For god sakes, here. It's cab fare. Go ahead. SHEILA: Hey Brogan? -Yeah? -Good luck to you. -Thanks. My luck is in the back of this car. [TRANQUIL MUSIC PLAYING]
