But IDF officials don't expect the celebration to last. ﻿Hezbollah troops are mobilizing along the bord ﻿and soon, our allies of the South Lebanon Arm who have decided to leave Lebanon ﻿fearing Hezbollah retribution, will be coming to Israel with the IDF troops. ﻿Excuse me, how does it feel to come home? ﻿Like a million bucks. ﻿Hey, Nishri! ﻿Go, Nishri! -Nishri, you're the man! ﻿After 18 years there are no more Israeli soldiers ﻿left on Lebanese soil. ﻿He's the man! ﻿The Last Band in Lebanon ﻿Shlomi... ﻿Shlomi... ﻿Shlomi... ﻿Shlomi... ﻿MAY 25th 2000 ORR BASE, LEBANON, TWO HOURS AFTER THE IDF PULLOUT ﻿Shlomi! -Fuck! ﻿You have to check out this view... -You ok? ﻿Since when are you up at 7 a.m.? -Come here, you don't want to miss this. ﻿Well, what do you think? ﻿Amazing... that nobody shot us yet ﻿One gold record, and I'm building a mansion on that hill. ﻿Before we begin, you should know that this stoner ﻿tells everyone that he's working on an album for Sony Records, but the truth is, ﻿he's a clown's assistant at birthday parties. ﻿Are you trying to go back to the military prison band? ﻿Do you know where the mess hall is? -I don't remember. Let's ask someone. ﻿Anybody here? ﻿Hello? ﻿Hey, someone forgot a shampoo. -maybe they're out drilling? ﻿How long does a drill take? ﻿How long does it take to make an egg I'm dying to smoke already. ﻿Will you stop shouting about how much you want to smoke? ﻿Cigarettes!

Let's go fellas! ﻿I found it first, leave it! ﻿You mind sharing with us next time you start sprinting? ﻿Did they see us? ﻿See that forest? ﻿I took a chick there once. You can't see it from the base. -What? No, let's stay here. ﻿Fine. Say hi to Nasrallah for me. -Wait, I just want to... ﻿run after you. ﻿Why's he running all the time? ﻿It's mine. ﻿Hey! Stop! ﻿They saw us. I can feel it -If they didn't, then they will now, so shut up! ﻿They're chasing us, who cares if they can hear us? ﻿They aren't chasing us. They're yelling something about a jeep. ﻿A jeep? -Shut up so I can listen. -Shut up so he can listen! ﻿The jeep is mine!! ﻿-CALL FROM MlRI- ﻿Sa'id... ﻿Shlomi... ﻿Leave the mattress. -But it's mine! ﻿They're gonna kill us and wrap us in a mattress. ﻿The forest isn't that far. -What's he whispering about? ﻿Ready? -If he wants to run again, it's probably his PTSD. ﻿If they see you running they'll shoot us all. ﻿Ok, stay here with this numbnuts and help him find his guitar. ﻿Who knows why they left him behind? -On my count? ﻿Get ready. -I don't like this, Shiomi. I have a bad feeling about this. ﻿Two... -You're supposed to start with three! ﻿One! ﻿Here you go. All yours. ﻿Oh, yeah?

Calm down! ﻿You'll give us away! ﻿You... Okay, never mind... ﻿Just think of all the money well get, ﻿think of all the money well get. ﻿and all the respect we'll get when the two of us bring back three Israeli soldiers! ﻿You don't want to split it with the others, do you? ﻿What do you say? ﻿Get this pole out of my foot! ﻿Your camouflage needs a little work. ﻿Did they see you? ﻿You could say that. -What are we gonna do, Shiomi? ﻿Okay, listen up. We'll run to... How far is the border? ﻿Twenty kilometers. ﻿Don't worry, someone back in Israel must be looking for us. ﻿Or in other words: "May we rest in peace." ﻿And the reason I'm being so dramatic so early in our story is Alon Nishri. ﻿- ISRAEL, NORTHERN COMMAND - Ethan, the IDF will never return to Lebanon... ﻿You promise? ﻿After 18 years? Are you crazy? What do you think they'll call the war? ﻿The Second Lebanon War? What is this, a Superman sequel? ﻿- LT. COL. ALON NISHRI - The king of smuggling stuff from Lebanon ﻿You name it, he smuggled it, ﻿everybody had to work with him, and whoever didn't... ﻿is no longer with us. ﻿Come out. ﻿Come on out, one coffee, ﻿two sugars, three minutes and you're good, I promise. Come on. Come on, come on. ﻿"But he didn't take one thing into consideration... ﻿No, it wasn't Dana, it was Prime Minister Ehud Barak ﻿who shut the party down by ordering a pullout, and that was the end of his "import" business. ﻿I'm glad you got home safely. ﻿Why? ﻿You missed me. ﻿I have a warrant from the head of he criminal department, to search your trucks. ﻿If that's what turns you on, go for it. ﻿Listen, if the IDF invades Lebanon again ey gotta come up with a killer name for the ﻿Like "Operation Protective Rock," or "Operation Tzuk.".. ﻿Ethan! He's just kidding. What are you so edgy about? ﻿Why aren't they looking for us? ﻿I dunno, maybe we should send Assaf to ask them. ﻿Assaf, what are you doing? -We have to defend ourselves somehow. ﻿Got a plan to take over the base, Rambo? Or are the rocks just for self-defense? ﻿That's it... That's it... ﻿We're all going to die. ﻿Where are they going ﻿Think they gave up? ﻿I think they realized nobody will pay a dime to get you home. ﻿Come on, here's our chance. -Our chance for what? ﻿To get home. Let's go. -What? ﻿Crossing Lebanon in our underwear, that's your plan? ﻿My plan was to raise a family one day. But right now, not dying is good enough. ﻿Get up, Assaf. I don't think it's a good idea. ﻿ou thought it was a good idea to get fucked u after the show. You lost your right to think! ﻿Excuse me, Mr. Navigator, do you know how many hostile villages there are on the way? ﻿Three? four? I didn't ask how many men you've had sex with ﻿Well? -55. ﻿Those Arabs sure can lay bricks. -It's better than sitting here waiting. ﻿Good luck. By the way, that's the way to Syria. -Shiomi! Wait a minute! ﻿Someone's gotta come and rescue us. We should just stay here. ﻿I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with numbnuts. ﻿We should stay here. -See? He's a combat soldier, he knows. ﻿We'll make sure they all left the base and go back there. ﻿Shiomi, we're out of here. ﻿What are you talking about? -Nobody knows we're here. Nishri made sure of that. ﻿Nishri, the motherfucker from before? -Shiomi, you're talking instead of walking. Let's go. ﻿There's a phone in the base. -And you know what else is there? ﻿Men with guns. -Who won't think we're stupid enough to go back there. ﻿My plan was very simple: Go back to the base, find a phone, get back to Israel ﻿and bury Kobi in the orchard behind my house for convincing me to come here. ﻿But why go back to the base? ﻿Got a better idea? ﻿Yeah. ﻿To stay alive? ﻿I don't know who this Nishri guy is, but my dad has connections in the army too. ﻿He'll come looking for us for sure. ﻿hasn't spoken to you since you ruined his care so excuse me for not counting on it. ﻿Bro... ﻿I know you're mad at me, but let's put that aside. ﻿We're pencil-pushers, we've never been in Lebanon. ﻿Funny, that's just what I told your dad before he transferred me here. ﻿I'm not coming with you. ﻿Just so you know, if you go now I'm leaving the band. ﻿Don't move, we'll be right back. ﻿Shiomi... What if there's an ambush waiting? ﻿Then shh... ﻿Shlomi... ﻿You asshole, you said a little diversion and we're out of here. ﻿Nishri screwed me. -Didn't you say he was your friend? ﻿He flipped on me last night, I swear on Miri's life! ﻿Quiet, I don't need Assaf losing it on me. -Yeah, cause he's been perfect so far. ﻿Worse comes to worst well get him some Ritalin from the infirmary. ﻿Okay, at this point you're probably thinking I'm a shitty friend to Assaf, ﻿but you see, Kobi had a plan to pay off the debt his dead father left him ﻿- A WEEK BEFORE - All we need is a one-hour gig, just me and you, ﻿while Lt. Col. Nishri's men load the cigarette packets ﻿into the truck panels and smuggle them into Israel. ﻿We won't even get our hands dirty. -Is that right? -That's right. ﻿Shiomi, I'll owe you big-time. -What do you mean by "big-time"? ﻿And all I needed was for him ﻿to owe me big-time.. - A FEW HOURS BEFORE... ﻿Baby, doesn't the ring mean anything to you? ﻿The only reason you proposed ﻿is so Kobi would think we're engaged and you're not just screwing his sister. ﻿That's crazy! ﻿Kobi would rather lose a testicle than play with Assaf again. ﻿What's that got to do with it? -You'll never get the band back together. ﻿Hey, Miri, when do we have to pay the lawyer back? ﻿May 25th. -Fuck, that's the day I get the grant. ﻿Take this. -What is it? ﻿What's that? -I found it in the street. It might be worth 2,000 shekels. ﻿Although I doubt it, it doesn't even have a diamond. ﻿You can always give it to one of your girlfriends. ﻿Miri, listen... ﻿We're through, until you grow some balls. ﻿Come on, Miri... ﻿Miri... Miri... Miri... Miri.. ﻿And why is Assaf here? Because since the band broke up five years ago ﻿his greatest achievement was moving out of his parents' house ﻿into the guesthouse in their backyard. ﻿- FIVE DAYS BEFORE... - What kind of opportunity? ﻿I mean, that's wonderful, but what kind of opportunity? ﻿There's a big-shot from a record company doing army reserve in Lebanon ﻿and I thought if I perform there, maybe... ﻿I wrote a song... -Listen, I don't think I have time to play a gig with you... ﻿No, no, no, I just need your dad to get me a permit, just me. ﻿Oh... ﻿Sure. ﻿That's a bit of a problem. -Really? ﻿I can ask him to get a permit for me, ﻿and for a friend, but just for you... ﻿You know my dad, he... ﻿He hates your guts. ﻿What?! Since when? ﻿Never mind. When do we leave? ﻿What did I tell you? now I'm gonna get that motherfucker Nishri. ﻿(Arabic) Put down the telephone. ﻿What'd he say about the telephone? -Put it down. ﻿.Thought so ﻿(Arabic) A little far from home, aren't you? ﻿(Arabic) We just came in to see what those stinking Zionists left. ﻿(Hebrew)'Tm coming home... ﻿Me and my guitar..." ﻿Shlomi? ﻿(Arabic) Get moving. -What? ﻿I don't know, the joint, the underwear, the guitar, take your pick. ﻿You're the ones who wanted to go back. -Shut up! ﻿Where are they taking us? ﻿(Arabic) Where are you taking us? -Uscut (shut up)! ﻿Where's Uscut? -,I'll give you a hint ﻿it's near Ron Arad's house (Israeli POW). ﻿And so, after a five-year separation, I finally got the band back together, ﻿only to be kidnapped in Lebanon... ﻿Did you search the panels? -Yup. -Then search again. ﻿Pretty and stubborn! You're every man's wet dream. ﻿Got scared, huh? -Excuse me? ﻿You found out we were waiting at the border so you left the drugs behind? ﻿Who'd believe that you'd throw away... how much? Three or four million shekels? ﻿I told you, I have no idea what you're talking about. ﻿I just want you to know that I really admire you. -Really? ﻿o that's why you've been snooping around me for the last two years? ﻿Are you kidding? I'm a big fan. ﻿You're so good I couldn't even plant one of my guys into your unit. ﻿Honey, When you'll grow up you'll understand ﻿that that's what makes a good officer. His nfidential operations stay just that. Confident! ﻿But if you have two minutes I can show you. ﻿You don't say. ﻿Tell me, why do you always do that? -Do what? ﻿Why does every balding officer with a size complex ﻿who hasn't picked his fat ass out of the chair for years ﻿think he can get into my pants? ﻿Honey, if I wanted to get into your pants, believe me, you'd feel it. ﻿Of course, of course. ﻿Just between you and me, do me a favor, ﻿if you haven't found anything, don't try to plant anything on me... ﻿It's beneath you. ﻿Nishri, ﻿call Assaf Malka to your office, I want to ask him a few questions. ﻿Assaf Malka? -That's right, ﻿he played at your base last night. With an army band, a reserves soldier. ﻿I'll see if we have anyone by that name. ﻿Trust me. You do. ﻿Make one coffee, two sugars. Three minutes and I'm with you. ﻿Motherfucker. ﻿Those old rifles only have one bullet. ﻿If we run at the same time and split up we can get away. ﻿Worse comes to worst, one of us gets hit. ﻿Are you with me? On three. ﻿Three, two... one! ﻿Pussies. ﻿I didn't see you sprinting. ﻿Well? Everything taken care of? ﻿We stashed the goods in the abandoned mosque by the base. -Very good. ﻿One more week, that dyke is off our back, ﻿we go into Lebanon, grab the goods and build a road... To bypass the MPs! ﻿What about the band? -We shut them up like you told us to. ﻿Then bring Assaf to the office, the dyke wants to question him. ﻿"Bring him"? We shut them up. ﻿And? ﻿And what? They're quiet. ﻿Awesome, so bring Assaf to my office. ﻿What do you mean "my office"? We left them in Lebanon. ﻿What? -You said "shut them up." ﻿I told you to shut them up. Bribe them, threaten them. ﻿I never told you to leave them in Lebanon. ﻿Really? -Really? ﻿"Really?!" ﻿At what point did you think I'm capable of ordering you to kill three of our own men? ﻿I dunno, maybe when you decided to smuggle out dope? -Don't answer me! ﻿Eliyahu, what do you think will happen when Hezbollah comes up with a photo ﻿of three kidnapped soldiers who were last seen on my base? ﻿That they wouldn't blame us for it? -Now that you put it that way, ﻿it makes a lot of sense. ﻿Listen up, you morons. ﻿You have one hour ﻿to go back and bring those three pencil-pushers here ﻿and pray... ﻿pray... ﻿pray that Hezbollah hasn't captured them because if they have, ﻿don't bother coming back! ﻿And so, after two hours of modelling underwear all over Lebanon, ﻿at least we agreed on one thing: Our goal... ﻿...was to find out whatever we could about our abductors. ﻿He says put the sacks down. ﻿Are they gonna kill us now or torture us for information? ﻿What info are you gonna give them, guitar lessons? ﻿(Arabic) Stand in a line! ﻿What'd he say? -To stand in a line. -Move it! ﻿No, not in a line, in a row! ﻿He says not in a line, in a row. ﻿Does he want us to dance the Hora too? ﻿(Hebrew) No, please, please, I don't want to die, ﻿I'm a musician, I've never held a gun. ﻿Shiomi, have you ever seen me with a gun? ﻿Do you know Ci Himan? (Israeli singer) -What are you doing? ﻿Give me the guitar a sec. -Assaf! -Okay, I can do it without... ﻿Assaf? ﻿Wars ﻿Don't happen in the winter anymore... ﻿You're really trying to make him shoot us, ah? ﻿It's too cold to hate, even for us ﻿Hey, you ﻿Big hero ﻿Come show me you can do it ﻿It's not so hard to be strong... ﻿George? ﻿You know that terrorist? ﻿(Arabic) You motherfucker! ﻿Well, at least we found out that our abductors aren't big Ci Himan fans... ﻿Motherfucker... ﻿In war... Go on! ﻿Show me a little love... ﻿(Arabic) Bon appetit. Want some of this? ﻿No thanks. Delicious. ﻿(Hebrew) Eat. ﻿No thanks, I don't like cake with grinded glass in it. ﻿Didn't you say he was with the South Lebanon Army? -The best tracker on our base. ﻿So he's on our side, right? -I've never met an Arab who was on our side, but enjoy. ﻿I can't eat. ﻿Shiomi, tell him I want my guitar back. ﻿Be polite, this is their house. -Polite? ﻿You're lucky I don't bash your head on the table. ﻿Polite enough for you? -What did he say? ﻿Don't piss him off, he might be our only chance of going home. ﻿I warned you, these are the bastards from yesterday. -Calm down, George. ﻿Let me speak to them alone. ﻿Go fuck yourselves! ﻿(Arabic) Could you take us to the border? -No problem, ﻿but I'd be grateful if you'd explain a few things. ﻿You want to know why we were in our underwear? ﻿I just want to know where you were last night. ﻿We had a gig at the base, why? ﻿Because last night three Israeli soldiers stole goods from us ﻿that we were going to give to Hezbollah as protection money ﻿so they wouldn't kill us and our families... ﻿and they'd let us stay here after the IDF pulled out. ﻿George! ﻿George, I brought you a... ﻿Surprise. ﻿The footprints led us to the Orr Base. ﻿Which means...? -Which means...? ﻿What's the matter? -He won't give us back the guitar? ﻿I should've listened to your sister. -What does that mean? ﻿What do you know about this? -You don't really think we... ﻿You're the only three Israelis here. ﻿This is our first time in Lebanon, we have no idea what happened, we're just a rock band. ﻿Are you sure? -Want him to do an impression of Farid Al-Atrash? (Famous Arabic singer) ﻿Do you really think this is the time to get smart with me? ﻿Because my brother-in-law is just waiting for a chance... ﻿No... No, no, no. ﻿Start talking! ﻿All I know is the base commander Alon Nishri and his men left us behind... ﻿There may be a connection, but we have nothing to do with it. ﻿Nishri? You think so? -Makes much more sense than the band. ﻿He'd never do that to me. ﻿the only one who knew we were planning to s ere and that we raised the protection money... ﻿Yes, and he agreed to turn a blind eye... ﻿Believe me, if he wanted to he could've arrested us and confiscated everything. ﻿But as the regional commander he would've had to report it, no? ﻿Either way, Nishri isn't here, our stash isn't here, ﻿but those bastards are here! -I'm not blaming you, ﻿I'm just reminding you that I gave you permission to talk to Nishri. ﻿That dwarf Kobi is a big hustler. It's gotta be them! ﻿Nobody touches them. That's an order. -An order? There are no more orders. ﻿Since the those fucking Zionists left us to defend ourselves, there is no South Army! ﻿No more orders! ﻿Either we pay Hezbollah the protection money ﻿or we end up like all the cowards kissing the IDF's ass ﻿and moving to Tel Aviv. ﻿You didn't find the goods at the base, did you? ﻿No. ﻿Tell the men to collect all their valuables. We'll pay off Hezbollah with whatever we've got ﻿For God's sake... For God's sake, Fadi! ﻿You're putting all of us in danger. ﻿Shiomi, that kid is getting too attached to my guitar. ﻿Don't worry, we'll thank them, ask for the guitar and get outta here. ﻿They give me a dress but no shoes? ﻿Honey, do you have matching high-heels? -Cut it out already! ﻿What's your problem? ﻿You know, that guitar? ﻿It's mine. ﻿Yes. ﻿It sure is... ﻿Assaf. ﻿Don't touch the guitar. Getting out of here is more important than a string, right? ﻿All right. ﻿I'll jump him, you grab the guitar, and we run for it, got it? -Assaf. ﻿Assaf, look at me. ﻿Look at me! ﻿I'll rip out your spleen with a spoon if you go near that guitar. ﻿Here... ﻿Here are some blankets and pillows. Hide in the barn, ﻿tonight I'll wake you up and take you to the border. ﻿Thank you very much. ﻿What did he say? ﻿That you're going to get even with Nishri tonight. ﻿How does he know Nishri? ﻿And for numbnuts here, he means we're going back to Israel ﻿where I'm going to find Nishri and nail his balls to a tree. ﻿Really? -Yes. ﻿I can't believe it. ﻿Shukran (Thank you in Arabic) ﻿Thank you. ﻿Shukran to you. ﻿Shlomi, I got him. Grab the guitar. ﻿Thank you. Thank you. Don't ruin this. ﻿Excuse him. Thank you. ﻿The barn is behind the house. ﻿Thank you. ﻿How could you do that to them? ﻿Do what? ﻿You said they smuggle cigarettes. -Did you know about this? ﻿I'm sorry. But I didn't know Kobi brought me here to smuggle drugs. ﻿What drugs? What are you talking about? -You said you and Nishri were friends. ﻿Not exactly. -Not exactly? Then what? ﻿That was the moment I realized that whether or not we were going home, ﻿if we leave it to Kobi... - TWO WEEKS BEFORE - someone would kill us today for sure. ﻿The base logistics officer has a lot of power, eh, Kobi? ﻿Really? What kind of power? -To give out comfy boots and jackets... ﻿and, just once in awhile, ﻿to smuggle cigarettes out in soldiers' bags. ﻿Doing good business, huh? ﻿I don't know what you're talking about. -Really? ﻿That's not what we heard. -Yeah, that's not what we heard. We? I told him about this. ﻿Kobi, my guys here keep track of everything that's going on in this base, and... ﻿how should I put it? ﻿You hit the jackpot. -We even have photos. ﻿You put them in an album? ﻿I thought it would be nicer. ﻿As I see it, you have two choices. Either the MPs get these photos ﻿or you do us a little favor. ﻿You help us and well help you. ﻿And maybe you'll even make ten grand while you're at it. ﻿Five grand while you're at it. ﻿Do I have a choice? ﻿Mashiach tells me you used to play music in an army band. ﻿Yes. -I saw you play once, I had a really good time. ﻿Will you get him out of here? -What? it was a great gig. ﻿Rottman, all you have to do is get your band ﻿to play here the night of the pullout hile we load a few packets onto the trucks and ﻿The photos will disappear. ﻿I'll do it for 30 grand. -What? ﻿Why are you talking to me like I'm a street vendor? ﻿Want me and Mashiach to arrange a little work related accident for him? ﻿Only without the work... ﻿Get it? ﻿Just the accident, no work. ﻿Too bad, if you rat me out to the MP I'll have to tell them about your plan. ﻿You know what happened to the last person who threatened me? ﻿Yeah, you know what happened? He was hit by friendly fire. ﻿Only without the friendly ﻿Get it? Just the fire. ﻿Without the friendly ﻿I got it. ﻿Of course I'm not threatening you, but we're all gonna lose our business here, ﻿so we might as well go out with a bang, right? ﻿Do you have permits to bring these pencil-pushers? ﻿Hold on, hold on ﻿You told him to bring me here just so you could get the permits? ﻿No, you butted in with your guitar as usual. -Assaf, I'm sorry, it was one big mistake. Wow, wow... I don't believe it. -Assaf... ﻿You dragged me here and lied about the record company exec, just for money? ﻿Of course not! ﻿I did it because I didn't know how to tell him I'm dating his sister. ﻿You have a record deal anyway! ﻿What was that? ﻿He already has a recording contract, I don't know why he's so upset. ﻿No, the other thing. ﻿What other thing? ﻿That thing about my sister? ﻿Kobi, you can't do this! I'm the one who's pissed at you! ﻿After I stab your ass, you can be as pissed as you like! ﻿Come on, Kobi... ﻿We shouldn't be wandering around the village. -Don't worry, ﻿I'll catch you before Hezbollah does. ﻿kay, should have thought about these guys to ﻿(Arabic) Grab them. ﻿If there's gonna be a killing today, it will be me killing you! ﻿(Arabic) We should kill them! ﻿Hezbollah will be here any minute, ﻿let's give them the Israelis instead of the protection money! ﻿Why are they so quiet? But they're Israeli soldiers, we fought together. ﻿(Arabic) He's right! ﻿They're the Israelis who stole the money that we were supposed to pay Hezbollah. ﻿What do you think Hezbollah will do to us when they find out we don't have the money? ﻿He's right. ﻿But we should kill them... -Kill who?! ﻿ e have to kill the Israelis. ﻿(Hebrew) Get the rifle from the house. ﻿What? -Get the rifle from the house. ﻿I can't hear you! ﻿Get the rifle from the house! ﻿(Hebrew) What are you looking at? You don't speak Hebrew! ﻿(Arabic) Let's kill them! ﻿Wait a minute... ﻿Quiet! ﻿What's with you, George? Are you crazy, shooting at the house? ﻿Why are you hiding Israelis? ﻿I warned you they wouldn't just stand there. ﻿(hebrew) Don't you get it? Give it to me or I'll kill you! ﻿Nice going. Now we're really in trouble. ﻿Because of those Israelis, the Hezbollah will kill us all! ﻿If I brought you two goats and a sheep you'd say they stole our money. ﻿(Hebrew) Don't move! ﻿Now what, motherfuckers? ﻿Assaf! ﻿I got the guitar! Run! ﻿One step! ﻿Take one step and I'll waste you! ﻿Translate! ﻿(Arabic) One step... ﻿He'll waste you. -What did he say? ﻿He's gonna shoot. ﻿(Hebrew) Didn't you say these guns have only one bullet? - (Arabic) Guys, this gun has only one bullet! ﻿(Hebrew) Don't move! ﻿We'll all jump them at once, ﻿Worse comes to worst, only one of us will get hurt. ﻿Three... ﻿Two... ﻿I can't believe we're related! ﻿You're done! ﻿Grab them! ﻿(Arabic) Nobody move! ﻿Back off! ﻿Translate! ﻿To the donkey! -Where's Assaf? -I don't care, we can't go back now! ﻿No way... -Get on! -Assaf! ﻿Shiomi? -Can we get the hell out of here? ﻿What is this? It's a turtle! ﻿I told you we should have killed them. ﻿Hey, someone left his shampoo. ﻿He hasn't stopped yelling for the last ten minutes. ﻿Listen up, morons, ﻿pick up the dope, ﻿and when the South Lebanon Army guys bring them here ﻿we'll plant 5-6 kilos in Kobi's gear and frame him and his two clowns ﻿for attempting to smuggle drugs and desertion. ﻿And I swear, if you screw this one up too ﻿I will get you and eat your livers, is that clear? ﻿Nishri! ﻿Those 5-6 kilos, we all split the losses evenly, yeah? ﻿Was he hurt? -Who? ﻿Your male ego. ﻿I was just wondering how it feels to turn from being the smuggling king of Lebanon into... ﻿a clerk. ﻿guess you haven't heard about my retirement, ah? ﻿Where's Assaf? -Where's Assaf? ﻿Where's Assaf... ﻿Where is Assaf? ﻿Moshe? What are you doing here? ﻿Nishri and I were talking and he told me about your little misunderstanding ﻿so we decided to close the case. ﻿Moshe, you can't do this to me. I have a lead and a witness... -Dana, ﻿you bypassed me and got your chance to catch Nishri and look what happened? ﻿Not a gram of hashish. -I still have... ﻿You're done. Go back to the base. I want a report first thing tomorrow. ﻿Want some coffee? -Are you crazy? I haven't seen you in years. ﻿Help us out here, you know how I like it. And you? ﻿She knows. One coffee, two sugars. -Three minutes I'm with you. ﻿Sorry, Nishri, ﻿I only heard about her little operation last night. ﻿Fuck you, motherfucker... ﻿Excuse me, do you happen to know a soldier named Kobi Rottman? ﻿Sorry, no. I'm not from this base. ﻿Okay. Thanks anyway. -Sorry. ﻿Did you say Kobi Rottman? -Yeah. ﻿Have you been waiting long? We were supposed to meet here two hours ago. ﻿Did you try his phone? -He isn't answering. Why? ﻿What? Nothing. I just... I'm looking for Assaf Malka ﻿and I think they were in Lebanon together. -Kobi and Assaf, in Lebanon together? ﻿No way. My brother hates his guts. ﻿Wait a sec. ﻿Yes, that's what it says here. ﻿Assaf went with Shiomi Hazan to the base where Kobi is posted. ﻿Shiomi Hazan went to Lebanon?! ﻿Alon Nishri's official position is not to release information ﻿on any of his men. ﻿Nishri? ﻿Yeah, why? Do you know him, too? ﻿No. ﻿Not really. ﻿Are you sure? ﻿Sure I'm sure. What do I know about the army? I did community service... ﻿Before I stopped being religious. ﻿I see. ﻿Well... ﻿If you hear from him. ﻿You'll excuse me, I have to make coffee. ﻿I bet you didn't do that in Community service. ﻿Bye. ﻿Maybe we should stop. -Why? ﻿Want to sing a song for a Hezbollah Records exec? ﻿Maybe you want to fuck his sister? ﻿I thought you'd like to know what that sign said, but never mind. ﻿This old donkey is sick, he'll stop eventually. ﻿We're going the right way, aren't we? -Yeah. ﻿To Sidon. ﻿Anyone know how to stop a donkey? -It's like stopping a horse, stupid. ﻿Giddy-up! -That means go, "whoa" means stop. Whoa, whoa! ﻿Well done. -Try the reins. ﻿I am, it's not working. -Didn't I say we should go back to the base? ﻿We tried that brilliant idea. -Why don't we just go back to the South Lebanon Army guys. ﻿Let's just abandon them, maybe Hezbollah will pay us 30,000. ﻿I told you I didn't know. -Keep doing what you're best at doing, ﻿running away when the going gets tough. -What did you say? ﻿You guys... -Ask your sister, she wakes up screaming every night since the accident ﻿while you wheel and deal in Lebanon. ﻿You screwed my sister once, and you think you know what we've been through? ﻿When you weren't there with her, I was. -Don't these trucks look familiar? ﻿Poor donkey. Probably looking for a quiet place to die. ﻿When we get to the next base, we'll sneak away and look for them. ﻿I think I found their footprints. ﻿I don't know... They'll find out. ﻿We'lI tell them we're going back to the Orr base to join Muammar's unit. ﻿They'll be glad to have two less men to share with. ﻿The villa youll build will help you forget the mattress you wanted. ﻿Villa! -Villa? -Villa! ﻿Villa? -Villa! ﻿Nabil! ﻿Said! ﻿Come on! We have some South Lebanon Army men to get even with today. ﻿Mind my foot! ﻿Grab the stuff! ﻿What did they say? ﻿Where are you going ﻿To find a cave to hide in until nightfall, and then try to get to the border. ﻿Why not go back to the base? -Because the Hezbollah Band is still playing there. ﻿Tell me, do you think the SLA guys would take us to the border ﻿if they knew where the drugs Nishri robbed from them were? ﻿They'd probably rather hang out together than get hung together. ﻿I know Nishri, that dope is already in every school in Israel. -I wouldn't bet on it. ﻿Nishri left it all in Lebanon ﻿when he found out the MPs were onto him. ﻿What do you mean, the MPs? ﻿Fuck! I'm such a lousy storyteller. ﻿For an hour I've been telling you about that ass Nishri, the diversion, ﻿about Assaf and his guitar, but I still haven't told you ﻿why we were left behind. -- ISRAEL - EDUCATION COMMAND, THE DAY BEFORE -- ﻿Sorry, if you want these permits you have to unbutton your shirt. ﻿Dad, you can't do this to me. -What did we say? ﻿Yaakov, you can't do this to me. It's my only chance, I can't be a... ﻿fucking clown's assistant all my life. ﻿I didn't want to have the same rank for the rest my life, either, ﻿but because of that stunt you three pulled five years ago, I'm still here. ﻿I thought you got even when you broke up my band and sent Kobi to serve in Lebanon. ﻿No. We haven't even started yet. ﻿And it's about time you gave up your stupid dream of being a rock star. ﻿Now, if you want these, unbutton your shirt. ﻿So you'll do anything to get me naked, huh? ﻿And don't forget to plant this in Nishri's office. ﻿I have to link him to the smuggled drugs. ﻿Are you sure about the shipment? ﻿That's what the dealer told the police. ﻿Do the math. 200 kilos of hashish on the day of the pullout ﻿and suddenly Nishri's base requests a special gig? ﻿Maybe he wants to keep up morale. -And maybe he wants a diversion. ﻿Well be waiting at the border. Your drugs charge will be erased. ﻿And then you can find a decent job. -I don't want a decent job. -Excuse me? ﻿I said I'm dying to find a decent job. -You... ﻿You may not realize it now, ﻿but it's important to you, to me and to our country! ﻿Everything we do. ﻿Don't forget to mention me when you bust them It'll help me finally get that promotion. ﻿Tell me, ﻿after all this... ﻿will be over... ﻿I thought we might... ﻿Fill out a complaint form? ﻿And after that? ﻿For sexual harassment. ﻿I wish I could tell you he's adopted. ﻿Just you wait. ﻿Once I score that record deal you'll be screaming: ﻿"I want Assaf Malka!" ﻿Like that. "I want Assaf Malka!" ﻿"Where is he?" Assaf Malka... ﻿The apple fell miles from the tree. ﻿Dana, It's Assaf. - LEBANON, NISHRI'S OFFICE, THAT NIGHT - ﻿The mouse is trapped. -What? ﻿The shark is in the pool. ﻿What was the code word? -The line is busy. ﻿Yeah, right. I just did it. ﻿Nice work. ﻿Thanks. ﻿So now that my work here is done, I was thinking... ﻿If you'd like to talk, ﻿you know, we've never had any quality time together. ﻿You never give up, do you? ﻿Hold on, don't tell me you're calling from Nishi's office. ﻿You think?! ﻿You stupid idiot! Nishri's working with the MPs, ﻿his men track every call that comes out of the base! ﻿I didn't know you were involved. ﻿Didn't I tell you he'd ruin everything? He always does. ﻿He ruined the band, he ruined my life. ﻿I ruined the band?! -You ruined the band! ﻿I ruined the band?! -And now we're gonna die! -Shlomi! ﻿Tell him who really ruined the band. ﻿Come on, Shlomi, tell him! ﻿Are you with him on that? ﻿Yeah, he's with me, you shit! you spoiled little asshole.. ﻿Cut it out. -Cry baby... ﻿Stop it! ﻿What the hell's wrong with you?! ﻿Your stupid fights broke up the band. ﻿So stop pretending, we're all responsible for this situation. ﻿At least now we have a chance to make things right, ﻿to go home, to save those poor South Lebanon Army families, ﻿and maybe prove to ourselves that we aren't just three pencil-pushers ﻿who just keep screwing each other over all the time. ﻿I don't give a damn if we can't play together any more. ﻿As far as I'm concerned the band is dead. ﻿I just want to get the dope back to the South Lebanon Army guys ﻿so they can help us get home in one piece. ﻿Now... ﻿Is anyone man enough to come with me? ﻿Besides the donkey? ﻿Asshole! ﻿Where did Nishri stash the dope? ﻿With our luck he didn't even press record. ﻿They haven't picked up the phone in hours, Yaakov. ﻿Something fishy's going on. ﻿Go home, I'll make a few calls and call you back. ﻿Don't worry, an hour or two and it'll be alright. ﻿Tell me, is every soldier getting a pullout grant? ﻿Only if the IDF wants to go bankrupt. ﻿Because Kobi said he's getting a 30,000 shekel grant when he comes back. ﻿That's ridiculous. ﻿Who'd authorize that kind of money? ﻿Hold on. ﻿Have a seat. I think I know where that grant is coming from. ﻿Get me Dana Cohen. ﻿Are you sure it's here? ﻿No, I thought we'd just take a walk and check out the architecture. ﻿What do you think? There's the abandoned mosque. ﻿The room on the west side, Just like the asshole said on the tape. ﻿Stay put. ﻿When you hear my whistle, bring the donkey. ﻿Shiomi, I don't think it's a good idea to leave me here alone with him. ﻿Sit down, big guy. ﻿Well catch up on old times. ﻿FIVE YEARS AGO... ﻿Don't you worry, I am careful out there ﻿I always wear a sweater ﻿No need to worry, there's no need I'm doing great out there ﻿Don't you worry, it's a lovely spot ﻿We're dropping bombs like candies ﻿We all have everything we need ﻿Don't you worry, it's a summer camp ﻿It's all games and parties ﻿Even yesterday I found the time to take a shower ﻿Fuck, not again. ﻿Don't you worry, I just dream of you Every night in bed here ﻿Please, you guys, not on the first song. ﻿When I'm back in town well get married ﻿Just send me underwear and undershirts So we won't feel like animals ﻿Fighting like lions, but morale is very high ﻿The company could use a break, ﻿Honey, please don't send me another cake... ﻿Son of a bitch! ﻿Son of a bitch... Do you want to die? ﻿I'll kill you! You're a dead man! ﻿Thank you, we were The Hebrews. ﻿I'm the lead singer. Get it!? Get it?! ﻿No, Kobi, a lead singer can actually sing... ﻿At least I didn't need connections to get here. -Oh, so I did? ﻿Get your asses back on stage, now! ﻿One more complaint 'cause of your stupid fights and we're in deep shit. ﻿I'm done playing with that asshole. -Really? I thought we'd do a duet next time. ﻿Idiot. -Just get on stage, I'll deal with him. ﻿Come on, Kobi. ﻿Think of all the ass you get from these shows! ﻿"Ass..." ﻿What's going on? ﻿Sorry, the show is over. -What? ﻿Why? ﻿Because we couldn't decide which one of us you're checking out ﻿So we decided to stop until we find out. ﻿Who do you think? -Me, I hope. ﻿What's that? What are you smoking? ﻿Oh come on, everybody is getting high in the army. Want a hit? ﻿Oh, yeah? -Yeah. -"Everybody"? ﻿- MILITARY POLICE ACADEMY GRADUATION - ﻿Okay, I got him to... -Come on, let's get this shit over with. ﻿Why didn't I get a psych discharge? ﻿Do you think I'm spoiled? ﻿You said I'm spoiled and selfish and I ruined the band. ﻿Do you see a couch, a clock and tissues? ﻿No. -Then why do you think I'm your shrink? ﻿Kobi, maybe I didn't lose my parents when I was 20 or had to support my sister, ﻿but l ve had a tough life too. ﻿My dad has hardly spoken to me since it happened. L﻿ucky for you, he set you up with all that money before that happened, and got you a car. ﻿They bought you the guitar, too, right? -Kobi, you can say what you want, ﻿but I earned that guitar with my own sweat and blood. ﻿- TO ASSAF OUR SUPERSTAR FROM MOM DAD - ﻿One more question. ﻿Did your daddy get you the record deal, or was it mommy this time? ﻿Sorry I didn't come to the wake. -Did you come to the funeral? ﻿Yes. ﻿I see. ﻿Kobi, I couldn't look you in the eye knowing that... ﻿it's my fault you went to Lebanon. ﻿It's my fault you didn't see them before the accident. ﻿What I'm trying to say is... ﻿Assaf, I don't need your fucking apologies. ﻿It's not like you anyway, so don't bother. ﻿Didn't you say the mosque was abandoned? -It was abandoned when the army was here. ﻿Maybe it's just the preacher. ﻿Assaf, let Shiomi handle him. You'll just get into trouble. ﻿Slaughter the Jews! ﻿Slaughter the Jews! -Shlomi will handle them... ﻿Come on, Kobi, we have to help him. ﻿Slaughter the Jews! ﻿Kobi. ﻿Slaughter the Jews! ﻿Slaughter the Jews! ﻿Slaughter the... ﻿Slaughter the Jews! ﻿Slaughter the Jews! ﻿Slaughter the Jews! ﻿Slaughter the Jews... ﻿How stupid can one guy be... ﻿Slaughter the Jews! ﻿Moshe, I'm telling you something here's not right ﻿Assaf has disappeared. ﻿Yes! ﻿No, I don't have proof, but the other two are missing too. ﻿Just let me interrogate Nishri... ﻿What? ﻿Moshe, you can't kick me out of the unit! ﻿Moshe! ﻿Piece of shit! ﻿So that's it? ﻿I can... ﻿try to tape it back together. ﻿I meant my son. -Yes. ﻿I mean, I don't know. He says they are being detained. ﻿No way. Kobi would have called me. ﻿Im sorry. ﻿What do you mean, you're sorry? You're Military Police, ﻿can't you track him or something? -I need a permit and a car. ﻿That's a little hard to get when your commander throws you out. ﻿Hard to, my ass. ﻿My Peugeot 306 may be small, but its a badass car. ﻿Peugeot... ﻿306! ﻿I'll bet you... ﻿if I had a dick that trash would be talking to me differently. ﻿But now he finally found an excuse to lose the only female on his staff. ﻿Move! -I'll give you the permit. ﻿Actually it's an order ﻿Just bring back my son. ﻿You know, if anyone finds out you're behind this... -I know, ﻿but it beats telling my wife that her son is missing ﻿because of his genius father ﻿who suddenly decided to teach him a lesson at the age of 26. ﻿Genius! ﻿We're outta here. ﻿Slaughter the Jews. ﻿Nabil... ﻿Are you sure the footprints lead here? ﻿They vanished 500 meters away, by the hill. ﻿More bread? ﻿Thank you, it's delicious. ﻿Enjoy. You know, volunteering to renovate all the mosques around here is God's work. ﻿Sorry about what happened, but nobody gave me a key and I thought it was locked. ﻿Don't worry about it. ﻿After prayers we'll clear the place out and you can start fixing it up. ﻿Now if you'll excuse me, I have to give today's sermon. ﻿I'll come with you. ﻿What are you doing? -Rescuing you. ﻿Why?! Why?! ﻿Because I'm a moron, that's why. -You're Jews? ﻿Pass out already, motherfucker! Pass out! ﻿But... ﻿he was about to go pray, we could've taken it all out. ﻿So blame your stupid friend. ﻿Let's get to work. ﻿Fuck! ﻿Ever seen 3 million shekels worth of dope? ﻿No. ﻿But I've never been in a mosque full of Hezbollah supporters, either. ﻿Is Assaf outside? ﻿Yes. Sort of. No, he went in, and then... ﻿What? ﻿They showed up. ﻿(Arabic) How dare you barge in like this? ﻿forgive me Imam, we're searching for South Lebanon Army agents... ﻿We thought they might be hiding here. ﻿There's nobody here but my sick brother and his wife. ﻿Oh, dear... Oh, dear... ﻿You'll excuse me. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Sit down, sit down. ﻿A little young, isn't he? ﻿He looks young. ﻿Alone... ﻿Alone! ﻿"En route to nowhere ﻿"Alone! (translating an Israeli hit song) ﻿"On the path to nothingness ﻿"Alone ﻿"With the fleeting time ﻿"And time forgets not to set the boundaries..." ﻿He may be young but he's amazing. ﻿Courageous! ﻿"Alone I shall walk ﻿"Not a prayer in my heart ﻿"Alone I shall walk, without ﻿"A future! ﻿"Without hope ﻿"Without ﻿"Without a dream. ﻿"Alone!" ﻿Allahu Akbar! (God is great) ﻿Allahu Akbar! ﻿You've been a great audience! ﻿Allahu Akbar! ﻿Allahu Akbar! ﻿Now that the Zionist foe has abandoned us ﻿we have nothing left but a prayer and a dream. ﻿But! ﻿People are entering the House of Allah armed, desecrating Allah's name! ﻿My fellow believers! ﻿Throw down your weapons, you are among brothers! ﻿No weapons allowed! ﻿thought I'd lost you. ﻿Thanks for coming to rescue me, just don't do it again, okay? ﻿Where's Kobi? ﻿Son of a bitch! -Son of a bitch! ﻿Kobi, what are you doing?! -Setting myself up for life! ﻿Kobi! ﻿Kobi, you can't do this to us! ﻿You betrayed me, and you've made a career of ruining my life! ﻿You asshole! ﻿Wait up, you prick! -So why can't I save my dad's club ﻿so I can have a place to perform? ﻿From now on, Kobi Rottman looks out, only for Kobi Ro... ﻿Kobi... -Fuck! ﻿Fuck... ﻿What? ﻿I had to try. ﻿I can't believe you would just dump us like that. ﻿Shut up! It's your fault we're here. ﻿Do you have to scream in Hebrew in the middle of Lebanon? ﻿Cut the crap, it's your fault too. ﻿I expected Assaf to stab me in the back but not you. -At least with me he expected it. ﻿Is that your thing? Taking advantage of 20-year-olds? ﻿She's 22. -And she's never gone out with a guy. ﻿She had three ex-boyfriends, one of them you put in the hospital. -Twice. ﻿So now you're nitpicking? -Don't worry, she just dumped me ﻿because I was afraid to tell you about us. -What? ﻿What do you mean, she dumped you? ﻿How long has this been going on? ﻿Since you became an officer. -Three years? ﻿Five, if you count the time I went with her to physiotherapy ﻿and the time I spent counseling her about that idiot you put in the hospital. -Twice. ﻿You've been hiding this from me for five years? ﻿Is that why you were willing to come here? ﻿I asked her to marry me. ﻿I didn't know how to tell you. ﻿Hold on... -What? ﻿So the ring she gave me? ﻿Technically you and me are engaged. ﻿I didn't want to say anything until... -Here, give it to her when we get home. ﻿If we get home. -Well get home. ﻿One loser in the family is enough. ﻿I don't know why I didn't tell you before. -Because I would've murdered you. ﻿A ring is a different story. ﻿Now pick it up. Don't get too cozy. ﻿How sweet. ﻿So now it's only me that everyone's mad at? ﻿Lucky me. ﻿Start pushing. -Shut it. ﻿For the first time that day I was filled with hope... ﻿I'm going to marry Miri, Kobi is going to be my brother-in-law... ﻿Where's the donkey? We thought you'd get here sooner. ﻿And this is what my whole life will probably look like... ﻿We're here to take you home. We won't hurt you. ﻿Freeze! ﻿Will you please stop trying to help me? ﻿Threats don't impress us anymore. ﻿Is that so? -Yeah. ﻿Then maybe this will impress you. Here's how it works, ﻿we take you and the dope home, ﻿nobody says a word, and everyone gets his cut, got it? ﻿It's no big deal. ﻿We can get away clean and still make 250,000 shekels. ﻿How about it? ﻿Are you serious? ﻿250,000 shekels? -That's only 2.5 percent. ﻿2.5 percent? Who taught you math? ﻿250,000 is enough to pay for an album. -Now you got him all excited. ﻿You guys, it's not a done deal yet... It could change, so don't... ﻿It comes out of your cut. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Assaf, what are you doing? -I'm not really a successful musician. ﻿I don't have a contract with Sony. ﻿I'm a clown's assistant at birthday parties. -You said a record deal, Assaf. ﻿He's full of shit. re we trying to change the world or something ﻿They say they'll take us home and pay us, too. ﻿Right? ﻿That's good enough for me. -Assaf, they'll kill that whole village! ﻿Who are we trying to kid? We aren't combat soldiers. ﻿Let's go home and... ﻿you can play on my album. ﻿Listen to your buddy. ﻿At least one of you has brains. -You got that one right. ﻿And here's an encore for you! ﻿What? ﻿"Here's an encore for you"? ﻿No way! ﻿We're on their trail, I can just smell those Israelis. ﻿Get out and carry on alone. One wound is enough for me, ﻿I don't want to lose my job too. I want to join the others. ﻿Go to hell, Sa'id! ﻿What are you looking at? ﻿You said re-enlisting was a good idea. ﻿Take out your cell phone. ﻿I can't. ﻿That's an order. ﻿Okay, just get me another pair of arms that aren't tied to a tree. ﻿Fuck! ﻿A little more... ﻿Easy there... ﻿There you go... ﻿Thats good... Excellent... ﻿Excellent. Is it out? ﻿I curse the day I met you. ﻿Hello? ﻿Nishri. Yes. We found them. ﻿Yes, the dope too. ﻿He's glad. -Glad is good. ﻿That might be a problem. ﻿Because we're... ﻿tied to a tree. -An olive tree. ﻿An olive tree. ﻿Yes, they're heading for the border. ﻿With our dope. ﻿He's not so glad. -Not so glad is not so good. ﻿Okay. ﻿Okay, we'll meet you at the border. ﻿We'll meet you at the border. ﻿What did he say? -To meet him at the border. ﻿How will we meet him at the border? ﻿How will meet him at the border? ﻿How? ﻿There's a jackknife in my pocket. ﻿Let me rest my head on a sand dune ﻿Let the muse roar ﻿Let me rest at every step ﻿Give the Israeli Army due respect ﻿So let me rest my head on a sand dune ﻿Let the muse roar ﻿Let me rest at every step ﻿Give the Israeli Army due respect ﻿Take your time and take it easy ﻿We're in no hurry here ﻿Only in movies made by Disney ﻿Does the desert burn in a flare ﻿- FIRING RANGE - KEEP OUT - ﻿There's no lack of wars ﻿And no lack of troubles ﻿So between rockets and missiles ﻿I'll relax in the shade ﻿So let me rest my head on a sand dune ﻿Let the muse roar ﻿Let me rest at every step ﻿Give the Israeli Army due respect ﻿What's going on? ﻿Get moving ﻿Get over here... ﻿Is this what you're paying me with to protect you? ﻿Leave them alone, they only did what I said. ﻿If that's so, ﻿you get to choose who we shoot today and who we shoot tomorrow. We had the protection money. ﻿Did somebody say something? ﻿We had the protection money but the Israelis stole it. -George! ﻿Now that we've all calmed down, what were you about to say? ﻿We had the protection money but the Israelis stole it. ﻿And I had a villa in Damascus but the earth swallowed it up. ﻿It's true, ﻿the Israelis are still in Lebanon. -No! No! ﻿Sorry, but these people insist on seeing your brains splattered on the ground. ﻿I swear, I can show you where they went! ﻿Are you sure that's the story you want to tell me? ﻿(Arabic) It's all here! ﻿And who are you, if I may ask? ﻿Me? ﻿Yes, you. ﻿I'm... ﻿You're... ﻿A cousin. ﻿A cousin? Then go join your family. ﻿I came to pay my cousins' protection money. ﻿With what? Your pretty eyes? ﻿I have 200 kilos of hashish here. ﻿What? ﻿You got lucky this time. ﻿Until next time. ﻿Send them home! -Go home you guys! ﻿Let's pack it up. Hurry up, I don't have all day. ﻿Just a minute... ﻿Who are these two? -Cut it out. They'll find out about our little trip. ﻿Shut up, Sa'id! ﻿They're just friends. ﻿Is that all? We have to get going. ﻿Who are you? ﻿Get out of the car! ﻿Nabil, Said! Why aren't you helping? ﻿I just... ﻿I think I know them. ﻿From where? ﻿Cut it out, Nabil! ﻿I don't know... ﻿Maybe they're... -A band! ﻿What? ﻿My cousin has a band... Maybe you've seen them perform. ﻿A famous band. ﻿Actually, we're on the way to a gig in Sidon, so if you'll excuse us... ﻿A band? ﻿A band. ﻿What's your band called? ﻿The Hebrews. ﻿The Hebrews... ﻿Brilliant name! ﻿Let's go, we don't have all day. ﻿There's a map and a gun inside just in case. ﻿Thank you. ﻿(Hebrew) You dropped your cigarettes. ﻿(Hebrew) Go, go! ﻿Sa'id! Sa'id! ﻿They're the Hebrews! -Yeah, I know. ﻿You know? -The Hebrews, I know. ﻿They're from the Israeli army, Israeli soldiers! ﻿Jews... ﻿people with big noses... ﻿and lots of money! ﻿Get in the truck, Sa'id. ﻿Where do you think you're going? ﻿Get them, they stole the hashish! ﻿See anything? -No, I think we lost them. -Don't say that! ﻿That's what you always hear just before they show up in front of you. ﻿Then they must be behind us! Is that better? ﻿Shiomi, step on it. Step on it! ﻿Get out of the car. ﻿Where's my merchandise? -in a safe place you'll get it when we cross the border. ﻿You think I have time for this shit? -You'd better decide quick. ﻿I think it's you who needs to decide. Decide if you want to stay here, ﻿Cause nobody'll find your bodies once I'm done with you....or... ﻿you turn around, take these two morons with you, bring my dope back here ﻿and you keep your mouths shut about all of it, got it? ﻿Now that I have your attention you have 20 seconds to decide. ﻿Give us a minute. ﻿We're coming with you. -Relax, Rambo. ﻿How long before the Hezbollah gets here? ﻿What? -What? -I don't have all day. ﻿Just a minute. ﻿How long? -A few seconds. ﻿We need 20 seconds. -What? -Don't you want to go home? ﻿'ve had enough with this shit. Count to 20. ﻿Out loud. ﻿16,15,14... ﻿13,12,11... ﻿Kobi, I'm not sure this is a good idea... ﻿6, 5... ﻿Nishri, what's that? ﻿4, 3... -Fucking hell... ﻿Drop your weapons! ﻿Freeze! -Move it! ﻿Drop your weapons! ﻿Freeze! ﻿Drop your weapons! ﻿Lower your weapons! ﻿Drop your weapons! ﻿Stay away! Don't move! ﻿Now what, genius? -I don't know, I didn't plan any further than this... -Great. ﻿Hold on. Everyone calm down Calm down... ﻿Everyone calm down! ﻿(Arabic) Quiet! ﻿(Hebrew) Enough is enough! ﻿Assaf, what are you doing? ﻿Let the sun rise and shine ﻿Let the daylight come in ﻿The purest of prayers ﻿Cannot bring us back... ﻿Have you totally lost it? -It's the only thing that's saved us so far. ﻿You could be right. ﻿He whose candle was snuffed out... ﻿What are they doing? -I don't know. ﻿How stupid can they be? ﻿Bitter tears will not awaken him ﻿Nor bring him back ﻿Nobody will bring us back ﻿From this forsaken, dark pit ﻿Neither the joyous victory cheer ﻿Nor songs of praise so dear ﻿So let us sing a song for peace ﻿Don't just whisper a prayer ﻿Rather sing out a song for peace ﻿And shout it out loud... ﻿All I wanted was Assaf Malka. ﻿Assaf Malka. ﻿Assaf Malka? ﻿Do you hear that? ﻿Hear what? ﻿Didn't I tell you it would work? ﻿I'm shocked. -It makes sense. ﻿It really does. ﻿Deep inside we're all human beings. Deep inside ﻿we all want peace! Right? ﻿Right? ﻿(Arabic) Drop your weapons or well shoot! ﻿Drop your weapons or we'll shoot! ﻿You sang so they'd hear us? ﻿Of course. What'd you think? -I knew that, too. ﻿Yeah, sure. Deep inside. ﻿Men... ﻿Nabil, what are you doing? ﻿Let's go. ﻿You grab the little one, I'll cover you, ﻿we kidnap him and take off. ﻿I'll shake Nasrallah's hand! ﻿My picture will be all over Lebanon, ﻿now do as I tell you, that's an order! ﻿It's all right... I'll take care of this! ﻿I'll take care of this! ﻿Go to hell, you stupid ass! -Grab them! -All I wanted was a mattress! ﻿I'm your brother... -A mattress! A mattress! ﻿A mattress! ﻿Good thing you showed up... ﻿From over by the fence we spotted those three hikers ﻿who had lost their way so we came to pick them up... ﻿Bullshit. ﻿You left them in Lebanon. -They'd be in trouble if not for us. ﻿Right, Kobi? -Assaf, all you have to do to get your charges dropped ﻿is to give me the tape, testify he left you here because of his smuggling operation ﻿and he goes straight to jail. ﻿See? Just like I said. ﻿Dana, over the past three years I smuggled cigarettes out of Lebanon ﻿in order to pay off my late father's debts. ﻿Okay. ﻿Now that I've said that, Assaf has something for you. ﻿That's the tape with all the details of Nishri and his lackeys smuggling operation. ﻿Assaf recorded them. ﻿And he left us in Lebanon. -Son of a bitch, I'll kill you... ﻿That's what makes a good officer. ﻿He conducts confidential operations that stay confidential. ﻿But don't worry, ﻿when you'll grow up you'll understand. ﻿Round 'em up, boys. No, no, no... ﻿Run, Eliyahu! Run! ﻿Take your hand off me... Wait for me... ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿For everything. ﻿So... ﻿So I don't need to look for a decent profession? ﻿I think being a musician is a decent profession, right? ﻿You're lucky to have such an amazing sister. -What do you mean? ﻿Hi. ﻿Hi.-Hi. ﻿Hi. ﻿Shiomi and I are together. ﻿You don't say. ﻿For three years now. ﻿And we're getting married. ﻿Really? -I'm shocked... ﻿That you think I didn't know all along. ﻿I told him. ﻿Okay. ﻿We're gonna have to set a few rules about that. ﻿Okay, starting tomorrow. ﻿What about me, Dana? ﻿I was talking about my drug charges, but this is also... ﻿Oh, please... ﻿Can we go home before I throw up? ﻿All I wanted was a mattress! ﻿A mattress... ﻿And so it ends. After 18 years ﻿there are no more IDF soldiers on Lebanese soil... ﻿I hope... ﻿But at least for us it's over. It's even a happy ending, ﻿for everyone! ﻿Nishri found true love in jail. ﻿Or... so his cellmate Momo forces him to tell everyone. ﻿Nabil nearly shook Nasrallah's hand after he joined the Mossad and tried to assassinate him ﻿Later it turned out that his brother Sa'id, had enough of the bad rep ﻿he caused the family, so he ratted him out. ﻿And Yaakov? ﻿He resigned from the IDF and used his pension to cover Kobi's father's debts, ﻿saved the Bar Banel from foreclosure and became the band's manager. ﻿Get in! -Assaf! ﻿Shlomi... ﻿Can we get out of here already? ﻿Move it! ﻿Cut. ﻿What the... Come on! ﻿Cut! ﻿Giddy-up! Chicken! ﻿Glad you got home safely. ﻿Let me remem.. ﻿When you say your name over and over it totally loses its meaning. ﻿I can't do this... ﻿What's your problem? ﻿We're family. ﻿Making love with the earth... ﻿Don't move! ﻿Malfunction! ﻿I also want Assaf Malka... ﻿Again. ﻿I want Assaf Malka! ﻿Guys, guys... -Let's fuck them up... ﻿Ofer, say like... "Idiot." Action. ﻿We're both named Ofer. ﻿Oh... ﻿Hey, it doesn't bother you that he drags out his solo every time? ﻿To the loving memory of Nimrod and Yohai Kricheli
