That's it, comrade. You're doing well. That's it, comrade. Very good, very good Good! Check it out! He's coming! That's it, push, that's it. Here he is! You did great. What are you planning to do now? Get it out of me. That's the best thing to do, fight? Did you tell Mauricio already? Neiber, please come here. Neiber, ?Don't you understand that I am talking to you? Talk to you later. See you. He was telling me about some guns, they are asking me. You stay with me No Don't you want more comrade? Can I have it? That's enough for a necklace or a bracelet. Can I ask you something? Yes What do you think about Diana having children, when the others can't? That's none of your business... or mine. Hey, I didn't tell you this morning how pretty you are. I forgot to tell you. The contraceptive is sacred. You must keep track of it in a calendar. If you have any questions, ask comrade Carmen. But please be careful. We're not going to fill this jungle with babies. No, relax Doctor. Okay. Go ahead, then. Carmen, a shot and a general examination. Who's next? Comrade, how are you? I hadn't seen you before. No, doctor. - What is your name? - Maritza. What can I do for you, Maritza? I haven't had my period in three months. Roll up your shirt. Put it on. Carmen, get everything ready. We're taking it out. Go back to your duties, we'll take twenty minutes. Come on, Maria, you too. We're breaking camp! You heard the man, the grunts are here. Go! Mauricio, Byron! Comrade, I'm sure the army is about ten kilometers south. Confirmed? Confirmed, comrade. Radio! Call Commander Words squad. Tell them we're running away from the enemy and going towards them. The kid that wants to join us is the middle one. Recruit him then. Come on! Paola, don't lower your guard. Come on, quick, they took us by surprise. And when do I get my boots? Later. You have four days to get delivery done and get back to us Stay away from these roads and the small villages I heard there are paramilitar and army forces around area. Besides, last night I saw paramilitary's flares to the north. I know the area, comrade. Don't worry. Follow the orders I'm giving you, dont't get too confident. Avoid any unnecessary risk. The rest of us will continue m Commander Yards camp, he 42th mm. We'll wait for you there, but only for four days. If you don't come back, we'll have to move on and you're fucked. Understood? - Yes sir! Absolutely, comrade. Turn on that thing at 5 a.m. and 5 p.m.. to report any news. The man waiting for you in town is a collaborator. But I need yourself to understand how's the situation there. Tell him that comrade Diana and I will go visit him as soon as we can. Any questions? Not at all, comrade. Permission to include comrade Yuldor in the mission. I'd prefer someone with more experience, comrade. The kid is ready. He is prepared. I agree. Take him with you. You leave in one hour. Go get everything ready to leave. I dont't have to tell you how important is this mission to me. Nobody outside this place can know about this. No matter who you run into. Nobody can find out I had a child. Can I trust you? Completely, comrade. Don't leave anything behind. Bury any left overs. Here you have everything you need, diapers, some clothes, powder milk. Are you listening to me? After you feed him tap his back so he can burp and won't cry. If he cries too much, bring him to your chest, That soothes them. Maria He's going to be alright. Maria? Are you listening to me? - Yes. This is very important. You know who you're carrying, right? This is for you to carry him. When you deliver him, ask them what they need. Have them make a list and send it to me. Tell them I'll go stay there a couple of months when things get better. Do you understand? Answer me then. - Yes, ma'am. Open this completely. Hold his head here. Slowly, slowly. Take care of him, please. Hurry up, you brat. 'Wait for me! Stop. Let me help you. Let's see... Maybe you'll become a man. Asshole. Let's stop here. What's wrong with the baby? I don't know, he must be hungry. Yuldor, get Maria the feeding bottle! Shut that baby up, he's giving us away. Can't you see we're trying? Secure the perimeter and stop being a pain in the ass instead. Yuldor! Come, we have to stand guard. - So? - He won't take it. Sing to him like you sing to me. Sure you'll make him happy. Reporting, Commander. Any news? Nothing to report. 5-5, comrade. Delivery status, NR. All in order, Commander. What is that? A compass, kid. And how does that thing work? This line and this stripe have to always be aligned with this little string. Let's see it through the magnifying glass. It always points north. Which is behind us. The south is in front. East and west. Got it? It's easy. Where is east? East? Over there. Don't be stupid, kid. It's that way, take this seriously. L know you'll learn a lot from me. But you have to behave. Here. It's the other way around. You can't leave them around. I won't. Okay. I'm going. Don't fall asleep. Of course not. All right then. He still hasn't fall asleep? No. Did you have anything to eat? I'm not hungry. Are you feeling okay? You're looking hot. No! Be careful with the baby. What about him? I don't wanna do it in front of him. - That's fine... - I said no! Go to sleep. How long have you been sleeping, faggot. I'm gonna get you executed, little brat. Go get the binoculars. Turn it around. That's upside down! Let me do this. Hold that there. That fucking brat fell asleep. Pick everything up, we're leaving. Comrade to patrol. Comrade to patrol! That fucker fell asleep. I just spoke to the Commander. Whatever happens from now on, it's your fault. We're under fire. They're coming straight to us! Shoot, you son of a bitch Â¡shoot! Come on, do something! Maria, go to the meeting point on my signal! Run, Maria, run! To the left, Byron, to the left! Move, man! Fuck, I got hit! Maria, Maria! Come over here. Quick! Hold on. Get down, get down! Wait, wait. Get up, come on. Maria, help him. It's okay. Don't worry, kid. Everything will be all right. Come on, I'll help you. Do you have something to drink? And where am I going to get anything? Get them some lemonade, so they can leave, woman. Let me help you. Where did you learn to change diapers? I took a course. Really? No, I helped my mom with my four brothers. So, you had to be the woman. Well, yes. Maria. Watch the old lady. Call me if you need to change this baby's diaper. Or whatever you need. Good to know. We had to deviate from course because of the enemy, comrade. No further news. Over. How's the package? Over. In perfect conditions. Over. I'll wait for your report tomorrow at 17. Over and out. This is no place for a child. Did you hear me? This is not a place for a child. Eat, kid. So you can get better. What does Mauricio say? Nothing. Shut up and eat. The thing was that... my gun got stuck, and I couldn't do anything. You saw that, right? Don't worry, kid. You were wounded in action. I saw it. But you need to learn how to use it once and for all. Who doesn't with all that slapping? Come on, kid. Eat. Stop carrying that child all the time, that's why he's always crying. Come take care of him then. Go give him to the elders. No, you take care of him. No, I don't know how to take care of children. Come, I'll show you I said no. No, I'm going to drop him. - He's so small. - Hold his head... It suits you. Comrade! Comrade Yuldor is dying. What can we do? Let's take him to Raul. It's four hours away. Four? More like six. Our only choice is to leave the baby with the old folks and come back later. That way we can go quicker. Go get Yuldor ready. Aren't you going to do it? Go give the baby to the old folks. No! They don't know how to take care of him. What? No! Are you going against my orders? I won't! Go give the baby to the old folks now! Let go of me! We can't leave him here. How are they going to take care of a child, if they can't even take care of themselves? Don't you think? Ready? Yes. I'll go get the boy. Maria, go get the baby and the bag to the old folks. We are leaving now. Ma'am. Ma'am! Ma'am. What do you want? Here. Maria, are you okay? Yes. We're about 500 meters away from the doctor's. Wait on my signal to go there. Don't go near the town and keep guard. Sixth: the national anthem of the Republic of Colombia. I'm going to see what's that. I'll be right back. Oh, unfading glory, Oh, immortal joy In furrows of pain... Give me water. In furrows of pain, goodness germinates now, goodness germinates now. Oh, unfading glory. Oh, immortal joy... Maria! What are you doing there? Hurry up, we're leaving! Goodness germinates now. Come on, hurry! Help him, man. Hey, don't fight. Don't fight. Second door to the fight. Go! Juliana! Go to your room! Maria! Is everything okay? Yes. What's wrong? Nothing. Did you stop loving me? No. Why didn't you tell me? What? How many months pregnant are you? How many? Three or four. Why didn't the doctor take it out? I was going to do it... But... I couldn't and we had to leave. Let me see. It's still small. Don't worry about it. I'll talk to the doctor and we'll take care of it. Don't give me that face. Let me tell you something, comrades. We are taking unnecessary risks here. Five kilometers from here there's a village... where people can look after us. Nothing will happen there. Turn that shit off. We'll leave when we feel like it. And I need that kid walking now. My commitment is to heal him and I did. There's nothing else I can do. I did what I had to do. There's something else I need you to do. Besides, we're all taking risks here. Yes, but once you leave we're the ones paying for it. I told you I would take care of it. We're always the ones who end up fucked. Stay out of it, Rosa. If I say anything it's because you're a coward. Stop it! Look, comrade. We agreed to let the house out of it. That was the agreement. There's now use for half-assed people. You're either with us or against us. I've done my share. I'm involved with the cause. Haven't I? What's the problem, then? I'm not bothering you I'm just saying that... If this bitch is on her period, you need to calm her down already. Comrade. Turn that shit on. Aren't you going to eat? No. Byron, eat Maria's meal. If you're not going to eat, then go take a shower, the doctor is going to take the baby out. Didn't you hear me? I don't want to. I'm not asking if you want to or not. Don't do this to me. What's up? I don't want to! I don't give a fuck about what you want. Go take a shower. Don't you have to go get your shit ready? How cool, huh? I'll be out in a minute. Do you need some shampoo? No. A towel'? Take me with you. Shut up! Take me with you! Look at your condition. I'm fine. No, if they catch us, they'll kill us. If you don't take me, I'll sell you out. Let's go then! Hurry UP! Get me one of those pants. That's the only one? It's for girls. Just put it on. Shut up or I'll kill you, you bitch! Open the door. What's up? There are fishermen around. Come on. Maria, get up. Let's go. Byron's gonna get us. Let's go. Help me! Let's go. Let's go. Help me! Maria... Let's go. Help me! Maria... Wait for me! Maria! Maria! Maria! Help me! Don't leave me alone. No, I'll go down... get the bus tickets, and then I'll come back for you. Don't leave me... Take me with you! GUERRILLA OUT OF HERE! RIGHT WING MILITIA. See? That's coming off now. Hey, darling. Where have you been, pretty girl? A cold soda to my girlfriend, please. Come on, have some aguardiente. Aren't you going to the checkpoint? Drink up, babe, it's on the house. You know what, Gringo? Why don't you sing one of your songs to my girlfriend? Of course, man. But she seems to be a bit scared, don't you think? Don't worry, babe, relax. This song will relax and cheer you up. Sing along with me, guys. Yeah, sure. Of course. Lime chicks say "peep, peep, peep" when they are hungry and co!d. The hen seeks... Come here. Corn and wheat to prepare the food and gives them warmth. The hen seeks... Hey, gentlemen, let's go! I'm coming back for you, my love. Let's get out of here! What were you thinking? We'll see how we work this out, after we finish. If you squeak, I'll kill you myself. Hey! This town is full of enemy militia. There's at least ten of them, and five pick up trucks filled with those bastards are heading north. Get them ready, we're leaving. Help me. Get up, kid! Get up! I said get up! Get up. I can't. Come on. It hurts. Get up, faggot. Help me! Come on... get up. Help me! I'm the one who talks to the commander. Got it? I'll talk to the commander. You stay here. I want to go, too. Later. Come in. What's the news? We lost comrade Yuldor. He couldn't fight the infection. And the mission? Fine, comrade. The baby is fine. Can I stop worrying then? Of course, comrade, you know that we... Where did you leave the baby, you son of a bitch! The paramilitaries took over that area. They took it over, you asshole! Where the fuck did you leave him? You son of a bitch! Where the fuck did you leave the baby? Where? Where, motherfucker? Where did you leave him? That's all I can do. The area is full of paramilitaries, and surrounded by grunts. We can't go anywhere near there. We have been ordered to draw back to a safe area. I can't risk any more men. But don't worry, babe. I'm sure the baby is going to be alright. No one is going to mess with him. The old folks are going to look after and protect him. They promised they would. As soon as things cool down a little, and everything returns to normal We'll go get him together. I promise you. He's your son, too. Where is my baby? Take me with him. No! To you mom, and to all courageous women...
