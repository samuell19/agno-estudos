Why are Delvers' maps always so vague? They say it's to prevent unauthorized excavation. Details of locations are spread by word of mouth, but in my case... You get your info from Lyza and Ozen's sealed letter. Don't worry, Nanachi. Leave it to Riko and let's keep moving. Sure thing. We have to respect our team leader's will. We made it. The Garden of the Flowers of Fortitude. These are all Eternal Fortunes... Don't go up to the top of the hill. You'll get hit with the curse. It's the same place... that I saw back then... Reg! Something wrong? Ah, it's nothing! Nanachi? I heard it too. Must be several of 'em. Riko! At the foot of the hill... Delvers! Some of them have collapsed! I should-- I mean, can I go check on them? Don't get caught. And also... My word is... Absolute! All right. Go ahead. Riko! If you see anything strange, you tell me. I'll watch over the force field. The consciousnesses over there are in total disarray. Are they confused or something? Huh? What's up? The thing that person's carrying... could that be...? Reg, stop! Why...? Why is he here? What's wrong, Nanachi? That guy is an Umbra Hand. An underling of Bondrewd, the Lord of Dawn! Bondrewd... Your and Mitty's enemy! Footsteps! 2 o'clock! That scream a moment ago... Was that your doing? Why don't you say something, huh? Be quiet. You'll wake them. Indeed, I did cause it. That said, these grounds have been declared as forbidden for over 60 days. ...What? So you entered without knowing, then. Well, that's understandable. Could it be... So it is Blaze Reap! Don't drop it again. ...But why? I'll say it again. This place is forbidden. Tell your furry friend and the other one, too. H-how did... Reg, don't say anything you don't have to! That bastard! Was he spying on us? How long have we been watched? Nanachi, if it's alright... I'll try to figure out what he knows about us. Hey... wait, that's...! Leave it to me. Nanachi's enemies are my enemies too! Hey! We'll decide what we're going to do only after I see what you're up to! Follow me. Is this... an insect? It looks just like a leaf. Huh...? Isn't this a... Riko, what are you...? Here it is! Nanachi, look at this! Take care in the flower fields of the Sixth Layer. If you spot one of these guys among the leaves, you've found their nest. They disguise themselves as Flowers of Fortitude, and will attack and lay their larvae inside organisms that come near them. Who? Who? Who? We discovered them only a short time ago. The larvae enter the head, and turn it into a convenient living food source. An astounding amount of native creatures are being eaten alive as well. So that's why this place is off-limits? They have already made a massive nest inside that hill. The insect's predatory adult form is spread throughout this garden, sleeping, waiting for the signal. The signal? Who? Who? Hey... it went in his mouth! They feed themselves to their food sources to make them last longer. I've already collected a specimen from his abdomen. That's when he let out a scream-- nay, a reflexive utterance. That must've been what you heard. These creatures are called "Amaranthine Deceptors." They come from the Sixth Layer. They are not supposed to be here. The sheer number of them has proved unmanageable. Your team's boss... what is he doing? That person is currently unavailable. Crossing layers is prone to difficulties. Who? That's the signal. I must hurry. W-what are you talking about? Burning agents have been dispersed in key positions in the area. Wh-what are you doing? Aren't there still delvers out there? The adult insects are entering their active stage. Either way, there's no way to save them. That can't be... Then I'll... I can-- Reg! What are you going to do about it? Don't say anything stupid. I can't defend Riko on my own. Get back here. Never mind. I can't do anything about it. Return to your friends. The Sovereign of Dawn eagerly awaits your arrival. Whatever happens to those people, or upholding my pride as a delver... I can't afford to be think about that now! I can't lose sight of what I must protect! No matter what! Damn it! They're going for any orifice they can! Ouch! even though got out of their territory! What a persistent bunch! Reg's back! Are you two alright? You're drenched in bug juice! It may be killing the bugs, but the inferno's consuming all the air too. Let's get out of here. Nanachi, forgive me. I couldn't figure out how we were being watched... Don't worry about it. No way you could have seen this coming. This is terrible. The field of flowers that mom loved... The Sovereign of Dawn eagerly awaits your arrival. That bastard... It's not just me-- Reg and Riko are in his sights too! What lies at the end of this journey? That is still yet to be known. Does something await them on the road ahead? That is still yet to be known. There is only one thing for certain: That someone awaits them at the bottom of this abyss and whoever that may be, they must keep advancing, for one must overcome the darkest night before dawn can arrive. Made in Abyss: Dawn of the Deep Soul The Fifth Layer, The Crossing Sea I came from the bottom of the fifth layer. That's where you'll find the Idofront the final point you can return from whilst remaining human Bondrewd's miniature garden. Inside is where you can begin "The Last Dive," the only way to get to the Sixth Layer. However, I don't think Bondrewd will let us just pass through. An encounter is inevitable... Keep that in mind. As I thought, the place where the insect bit you is swollen. I told you, it's fine- What? A water support collapsed. Stay alert... We're going for it. Hey, won't these collapse? Don't be scared, if it's just us on these we won't break them. Nothing will happen. Although, there are no signs of living things at all. Are there creatures around here that are good to eat? Umm... Ah, Hamashirama! "Hamashirama" Is this thing edible? Yeah, its not poisonous. "Salt made from dried algae" "Thoroughly rub body" The slime's spreading out... "Thoroughly rub body" The slime's spreading out... It gets tough if you go overboard, It's best raw apparently. Honestly, I don't think I have the courage for this... Don't make that sort of voice! ...It's sweet. This really hits the spot! You wouldn't be able to guess the taste by appearance. Riko, look at that wonderful sight over there... Nanachi, should we make another one into a hotpot? Can we? Riko, teach me how to make it too. Ok! Let's make it together! You sure are enthusiastic about this. I'm diligent, after all. I can't be satisfied with just being at the same level as you. You know, Mitty... In all her time in the Abyss, she never had the chance to eat anything good. That's why... That's why I need to be able to make good food. Because the next time I get to meet Mitty... I might need to cook her something. We never got to eat good food, like this, together. NANACHI! You're such a good person... Don't take advantage of this to touch me! Let go of me! Seriously... I'm not actually expecting to meet her... It's just my heart talking right now... Don't say that! That's right! It's too early to give up! This is the Abyss after all! We will find a way to meet Mitty once more, and find out why the curse of the Abyss exists, and learn the secrets of the Narehate and the relics. The answer lies at the bottom of the Abyss! Certainly! No one has ever seen the bottom, so there is no telling what kind of place it is. You sure are confident... Of course! I mean, that's Reg's original home. It's definitely a wonderful place! Now you two, Let's go! Damn it... This is the adventure to the bottom... that I have always wanted. Damn it... I'm actually having fun... Damn it... "The bottom of the Fifth Layer" "Idofront" That building... It's slowly spinning! How does it do that? Huh? Nanachi, are you okay? Yeah... I'm just observing the force field. Look, at the front, there's a part that doesn't spin. If you don't use a ship, that's the only entrance there is. They already know we are coming... Let's keep going while staying alert... You know, a thousand years ago, that building used to be the ruins of a ritual site. There's a tower right in the center of it, see? That's the device that takes you to the sixth layer. Wow... so that is.... Oh... A ritual site is a place where people pray, right? I wonder if it's a special place for the ancient people. No way... All those people are around my age... This is no good... So, what should we do once we get inside? I've got no clue what that guy has planned for us. You shouldn't tell them what we've being doing Let's get them to speak first Information is power Don't get scared, no matter what they say. Be on your guard. Got it. Do you know that person? No... Are you guests of Papa? Quite small, aren't you. Papa? Let's go. Well, for kids you did well to come all the way here Eh... Hey! How did you get here? The frozen road... No way! The crystallized water support? Information is power... Even if you lie, I'll know, I've seen it after all. How did you actually come here? Hey don't just stay quiet... If you lie I'll get mad you know. Is that no good? Ah! Do you want to touch my hat? What's up with this girl... Hey, you two! Save me! Please talk with me... I'm sad... Names! My name! I'm Prushka! Yours are? R... Reg. I'm Riko! Aahh! Ha ha! And this one? You're really fluffy and cute. Are those ears real? Can you speak? Aah! Papa! Papa! Hello there, everyone. You did well, making it here. Nanachi, you seem to be healthier than ever. That hat, it fits you well. By the way. The other day, that child's flesh lamp faded away. Congratulations. Nanachi. You've finally released her. Hey. It was you wasn't it... You were the one that did that to them! Bondrewd... Right now... I'm not in the mood to say anything... We're going further ahead. Won't you let us pass? Sure, I don't mind. However... However, the Altar used to start a last dive is activated by a white whistle from within. Do you know? A white whistle can only be used by the original owner. Whistles like these are made from a relic known as a Life-Reverberating Stone. Even if you are the child of an owner, if you have a different life pattern, the right tone won't be produced. Riko... is that true? That's what Habo-san said... and Ozen-san too... It won't work if you use somebody else's whistle. That white whistle is the key. Well, you can't do anything about it though. I thought that if I came here, things would work out somehow... We did a lot... I thought we could go.... Hey Papa. Is she a child of a white whistle too? That's right, Prushka. Can you get along with her? Yeah! There, there. You're such a good child. I have prepared a room for you all. How about you rest and think about it for a little? Prushka, can you guide them? Yeah! Come! I've already cleaned it for you! Let's go, Riko. Here's the toilet. You'll die if you fall inside, so be careful. Don't climb those stairs. You'll catch the burden if you do. This is the room. This spinny thing rotates to the left. Come in! These are energy rations type-4! These are those food items from before aren't they... Made specifically for delvers deeper than the fourth layer. A nutritionally complete diet! Is it fine to eat these!? Of course! I'm not having any. These taste like wall... Hey. Riko... wasn't it? What does Riko mean? The names meaning? I wonder.... I don't know... My name, Prushka, means the flower of dawn. Papa gave it to me. Hey have you ever seen a dawn? Prushka? Have you never been to the surface? I haven't. I was born here. Ah... but, I do know what a dawn is. Umm... It's when the light turns on! When he did the experiment, without a single care... He already had a daughter! What is he planning, making her get close to us? The sea is huge though? It's simply large, isn't it? Compared to that, the fifth layer is greater. Then what about the Inverted Forest in the Second Layer? The trees grow upside down and the waterfalls flow upward! Really? She's telling her everything... Well, I guess there's nothing we can do. Unlike outside, this place is safe, so have a good rest. Thanks... Good night! Good night, Prushka! I'm going to sleep... Good night. There no telling whats going to happen. I'm going to rest, while being ready. That pattern... Ah, the pattern on my helmet, I wonder if it's some kind of writing? Huh? It's different than from before. I thought so, but... That has the same pattern? This is a relic that produces air. The pattern changes every time it's used... I've seen several relics like this. The pattern signifies the number of uses left until it stops working. No exceptions. Bu- But, even though its decreasing, I've stayed healthy so far! Probably, the energy you use to move is insignificant in regards to the number of uses. There's only one thing that comes to mind... The incinerator. In a sense, it has the power to rewrite the rules of the Abyss. Looking at it it looks like there are 3 uses left... While here, please don't fire the incinerator again. But! I told you didn't I? I can't protect Riko. If you return to being scrap iron, that's the end of this adventure. Such a thing... If the time comes, is fighting him even possible? Think about what you can do with your arms... Is there some way... Is there any way to let these guys go ahead? It's alright you know! You truly are... ...you are all marvels of the abyss's fearsome power. I am truly pleased that you have returned. Bondrewd... I have something I want to ask... As do I... Come, we have many things to discuss... Pee... Huh? Where is everyone? That's right, definitely, They must have gone to the toilet... Where... I wonder where this goes to? Reg!? Nanachi? Reg? Where have you gone? The door where we came from and the one in the back won't open... All that remains is... Don't climb those stairs, if you do, you'll get the burden... Bondrewd is a bastard to the core. Be careful around him. I have a bad feeling about this... It'll be fine. Slowly... I'll squat down as soon as it's dangerous. No burden yet... I'm scared... Even though I'm scared, the fear of being too late is even scarier... What? It doesn't hurt...? What... is happening...? That's right, I have to squat down. But... Where is the ground? I can't hear my voice... I can't touch myself... My body... What's happening to it? Was my face supposed to be further inside...? The inside... Where... where is it? Riko! Aah! Thank goodness! Prushka... It hurts! So the pain's returning... Let's see those wounds... Huh, those are deep... These sharp things cut me out of nowhere... Actually, you fell head-first down the stairs. That's the Curse for you... ... It immediately takes away all of your senses. Open wide... ...Ah, some molars broke off... Usually you'd know your body's own limits, but while your senses were gone, you clenched your teeth so hard they broke. Oh... ...The ones that broke off were baby teeth. That's good, you can still grow them back. There! Thanks... Prushka, where were you? I was in my room. I woke up when I heard you scream. But... All the doors were locked... What do you mean? Even I lock my bedroom door at night. I have some stuff going on... I'm at that age, after all... Oh, right... ...still... How is it? It's strange... Everywhere's locked. This hasn't happened before... Then... The only choice left is the stairs. Reg... Nanachi... Right! Let's go together! But... It's okay. Meinya, wake up! This is Meinya! Papa gave it to me on my tenth birthday. Hey, Meinya. Show Riko the way! Yeah! Off you go! Will it be okay? Meinya's eyes and legs, they can sense things differently than our own. Did you know? For some reason the Curse... it doesn't affect the senses of non-human creatures! Leave it to me! There are tricks to this. I've been on plenty of adventures, secret from Papa! Hey, Prushka... ...what kind of person is your father? Papa's the best! I'm really lucky... He's taught me so much! Sure didn't expect you to have a daughter. There is no blood relation, but she is indeed my daughter. Cute, isn't she? So, she's not your actual daughter. Not like you could ever make a family, anyway. Nanachi. You say that as though families can only exist through blood. I do not believe that is the case. Dedication, and a compassionate heart, is what truly makes people a family. Even complete strangers coming together can make one. Blood only plays a minor role. Love. It's love, Nanachi. Love!? How dare you spout such crap... ...out of that narrow gap of yours! Even your curses are uniquely cute. Smell the scent of flowers? Riko, because this is your first time, focus with your eyes closed Even if you lose all your senses, you will be able to see Meinya's path. Yes... I can see it. Aim for that slowly. Slowly, slowly move forward... Riko, I'll assist you. Nanachi. The research has entered its final stage. Please, return to my side and work for me again. There is so much that I would love to show you. Bondrewd... I... I'm... ...Sure. I'll work for you again. That is truly delightful, Nanachi! You really are a special one. There are conditions. What? Those two... ...don't do anything to them. And then... ...let them go to the Sixth Layer! Whoa there. That is something I must apologize for. That boy is a rare and unprecedented individual. He's... already... It wakes... ...it wakes... What... It's Meridians are similar Similar. Sleep. Vitals. What are they talking about...? Similar. Sleep. Vitals. Similar. Sleep. Vitals. ...I can't move...! ...My voice... isn't...! Inside. Want to see... Want to see the inside... Want to see... No good, it wont work on metal. The light. Let's use the light. Damn...! What... ...What's going on!? Cut off. Cut off. H... My hand..! The urine is similar. What is the composition? Unknown Sufficient fluid from the opening has been collected. The sense of pain is excessively reproduced. The reason is unknown. Want to see the stomach next. Want to see. Desire a leg. REG! REG! Damn... What is this!? ...blessed one... ...blessed... ...blessed... ...blessed... blessed... ...blessed... blessed... blessed... STOP! DON'T TOUCH ME!! What are you doing!? Stop this, right now!! You were told already! These children are Papa's guests!! ...Reg! Nanachi!! Riko-- hurry, we're leaving! Reg...? ...Reg?? REG!!? Ri.... ko... REG! How horrible! What is the meaning of this!? I... I'm going to tell Papa!! That is a dangerous relic. If we hadn't lowered its guard, we could not have captured it. Could it be... ...Papa ordered this? But, Papa would never do something so horrible... You should not be here. Has the lord not told you so? Now, come... Come here... Now, come here... Now, come here... Now... Riko!? Reg!! ... Reg!!! Nanachi, Reg is...! He passed out, huh... Riko, we should escape for now. They've been planning this from the very start. But ... Reg's arm is still in that room... We will definitely get it back. Definitely... Is it really fine? It'll be fine. I'll tell Papa about the boat later. Sorry... That this happened to your friend... Prushka... You... There's no telling what might happen to you if you go back. They're acting so strange today... But Papa will understand. I'll ask him to return Reg's arm. I'm really sorry... You know... It might be improper to say this now, but if Reg is properly fixed... If everything gets put right... ...then ... ...nothing. Sorry for keeping you. Go. RIKO! I... ...want to go on an adventure, together! Papa... ...Papa!! Listen, about Riko-- Prushka. Soon, you will be ready to become an adult. Please, come with me and confirm the situation with your own eyes and ears. This Umbra Hand is one that you can trust. He will keep you safe, once we're outside. I can't stand this any longer. First, Mitty... ...I can't accept that Reg now has to suffer too. I don't know if we can stop him... ...but it's the only way forward. Re... Reg... Reg is... Riko... There, there... You did well to endure it... ...Riko... Nanachi... Reg!! It smells like the Abyss Stew... ...the burnt parts... ...What are you talking about? The smell? Here by the sandstone... Maybe... Nanachi. Please, don't look so upset. Prushka told me everything. A very important treasure, isn't he? I cannot return him to how he was, but I shall fix him well. Now, let's all head back, together. That's impossible. You aren't returning at all. That's... The Lord of Annihilation's... This is dangerous, Nanachi. Let's evacuate, immediately! You know... You've clearly not been paying attention. Try watching your step once in a while. Here, In the sandstone dunes of the Sea of Corpses... ...near their nest, the smell gets distinctive. Anyone who enters, without lighting a vomit beacon, will die. These ferocious insects... The best predators of the Fifth Layer. The colony of the Kasshou-Gashira. Reg! Nanachi! Riko! Are you safe!? Yeah! Are you both okay? I'm pretty used to the Fifth Layer's Curse now... If you can see the force-field, you don't lose consciousness. Reg, how's your arm? It actually doesn't hurt anymore... What's up? The pain... ...I can feel it on the missing fingers... Phantom pain, huh? In any case, we need to get your hand back. We can't afford any time to relax. Both of you, let's prepare our next move. Wait, Nanachi! They're... Already... That monster... What, how is he...? Sparagmos... the origin-guiding light. It cut your arm off, and burned through Mitty's eye when she was immortal. That's his weapon. What are you doing? Hiding over there? Feel free to show your faces. Damn, he can read the flow of consciousnesses! Probably not... I think he is hijacking my vision, that's probably how he's being spying on us. Papa... Riko... ...what should I do... My, my. Because you were right on top of the nest I was going to tell you not to provoke them but... ...to think you would show me that you "knew". Wonderful. Wonderful. So you knew it... I wonder if you can handle... ...what's next! Pa.. Papa! A light-stone bomb... suicide bombing. You truly are a boy. We're not done yet! I'm surprised. You aimed at the gaps in my armor, didn't you? This is... Those are Amaranthine Deceptor larvae. There is not a signle good thought in your head, so just let it get devoured. How... ...how wonderful... He shouldn't have been able to hear our conversations He has only being spying through my eyes Surprise him with the items that we have prepared. Shower him with things he doesn't know about Right now he doesn't have his cartridges... Cartridges? A device that protects him from the curse of the abyss. We don't have much time, we need to beat him before he gets reinforcements. Such a formidable power. I'm envious. Not yet... I'm not done yet! We don't know how many Sparagmos there are. We have to make sure he doesn't fire it. He can't fire underwater without creating a massive steam explosion. I see... How surprising. Did you all think of this? Wonderful! Wonderful! Now! Reg! Just below the water is the sixth layer, so give him a taste of it! How dare you do that to Mitty and Nanachi! If you love experiments that much! You can... Experience it yourself! Wonder... ...ful... Won..der..ful... Wonder... Wonder...ful... Take your final breath... Blow that whistle... We'll go... beyond... here... Damn... why...! Sorry Reg... that you had to do something like this... Papa... Prushka! Papa! Papa! Are you alright? Papa... Please! Papa! Cruel... How cruel! Damn... So what... so what! Papa... Please don't leave me... Ah...! Papa! Papa's here, Prushka Papa! Papa! I'm glad! I won't go anywhere. As long as I have your love, I am immortal. Don't mess around! What the hell are you!? That reminds me. I haven't introduced myself. I am Bondrewd. Delver of the Abyss. Known by many as the Lord of Dawn. You truly are wonderful. You've brought tribulation which we could not, and paved the way for Prushka's completion. Challenges deepen love. Wouldn't you agree, Nanachi? Wait! Ah... Courageous and cute. I certainly desire every one of you. Those are Shaker Needles. Please do not be alarmed, they will only slightly turn your viscera. Bastard! What's going on? Why are there two of you? Two? Every single one of the Umbra Hands is but myself. Now, Nanachi. Let us go together. Why... why me...? The Abyss does not merely grant curses. There exists an effect that is rarely observed, I've called this phenomenon a blessing. You are deeply, spiritually tied to Mitty. When partnered, only you received the blessing. You are the only successful case. Love. That is Love, Nanachi. You lowlife fiend! Woah there... Prushka almost woke up. I apologize, but I must take my leave. Feel free to come anytime. I shall welcome you. Ah... Please discard of everything marked in red. Papa... Papa... I want to see the dawn... Yes. Let us witness the dawn together. Together would be nice... Together... On an adventure... Indeed. We shall be together You can do it! Hang in their Riko! Riko, you'd be Lord of the Children! I'd prefer something a little cooler... Then, the Lord of Forehead Glasses! Hey Riko, what do you want to do once you become a White Whistle? You know, I thought that I wanted to meet my mother after becoming a white whistle, but now I wonder if that's actually the case...? It could be that my mom is not the one waiting at the bottom. I know that, but that just makes me more excited... Who exactly wrote the letter...? Why does the curse of the Abyss exist? Who made Reg, and for what purpose? I mean, even his penis can grow, you know? What's a penis? Usually, it looks like this... And then if Reg sees boobs or rubs Nanachi... Ah! You mean like Papa's rod! That aside... my wish to meet my mother, somehow... feels like it's just become an excuse... And a white whistle, now I just want to have one so that we can go down to the sixth layer... But, you know... there's one thing that hasn't changed... I want to go on an adventure together with them. It's a secret to them... I mean, this just sounds like I have no goal in mind. Riko, you are amazing. Riko, you're not going just because you want to meet your mother. You want to become like your mother, and to go on an adventure together. Your true intentions have overtaken your excuse! True, its not for me. Then let's go! Thanks, Prushka! You've cheered up! I want to talk with them both as soon as possible! You know Riko... That Reg kid is far more amazing than Papa's special grade artifact, right? You'll definitely be the first white whistle armed with a treasure of the Abyss. Advance Riko... Slowly, slowly... Don't look back. No matter how dark it becomes, you'll be fine. You're very bright after all. A flower of dawn withers when noon comes. However, you'll keep moving forward... Hey Riko... I have always wanted a friend like you... Riko... I want to go on an adventure together... Prushka... No... no! DON'T GO, PRUSHKA! Don't move! You're hurt internally! From here... What should we do...? Nanachi is in no state to think... What was that, that monster? His movements after he transferred bodies was too much to handle... Not yet... Riko... We can't give up yet. In the artifact catalog... But what? Hey... What going on? Riko has memorized almost the entire artifact catalog Something from there might be involved... Look at that, his remains. The head is all bunched up there... Only the mask was taken. The head wasn't replaced...!? Zoaholic? What? Zoaholic! It lets you plant yourself within another person... Allowing you to increase your own self...! But the users who mixed and increased their consciousnesses went insane. In the records it was treated as lost for the last fifteen years. White whistles aren't supposed to have it but I remember that Prushka brought it up. So that's the true nature of the mask...! Zoaholic is shaped like a bottom that's at least the size of room... Am I wrong..? Do you guys remember what that Umbra hand said in the Garden of the Flowers of Fortitude? "That person is currently unavailable" "Crossing layers is prone to difficulties." Is it that... He can transfer his consciousness without his mask, but it will go awry if he jumps over the force field, right? It's probable that the mask is merely a symbol of the Lord of Dawn, Bondrewd the Novel... It would serve to imprint the presence of a father to that sheltered girl, Prushka... Anyway... Zoaholic is it? That thing's suspicious. It's certainly something that fiend would like. That's Nanachi for you! The brains of our team! But we might be wrong. But it's worth checking out! Yeah! That's right... Yeah, that's right. If I give up before you guys... I wouldn't be able to face Mitty... Right! Let's go blow up that huge ass-like thing! Something like that can only be in one place. Let's do it, you two. It's time to end this and take back our adventure! Reg's energy source is electricity! There was that time in Orth When the power went down. However... That might have caused Reg's memory loss... If it makes you forget about us... Riko. The incinerator is absolutely necessary against him. After the first shot, those 10 minutes before I pass out will decide who is victorious. Anyway, don't worry. I won't ever forget about you. REG! Ah.. Listen, the Idofront generates its own power. It probably generates less than that town on the surface... Recovering some power should be possible though. Reg, you take care of the power plant by yourself Riko and I will buy some time. Because the whirlpool is inside the Idofront, you don't have to worry about getting caught in it. Sun Sphere...! That's right, this way... This way... This guy, how many of them are there? What should I do? Hey Nanachi... The Lord of Dawn's White Whistle... Why could he use it...? Only the original owner should be able to... Reg... Have you done it? Here... Where is this...? Who did that? Where? Where? Where? Nnaa... His vision hijacking won't work in the dark. Nanachi, Reg isn't responding... What's the commotion? It must be Reg! The communication device isn't working, so he's shaking it so we know! You sure are optimistic... Anyway, lets get to Prushka quickly! It was with Prushka... Meinya! You came! You smell like Prushka... Meinya! Hey! Meinya! Riko! I think Meinya wants us to follow it! What do you... Over there... I'm done... I wonder what... This is...? This is the processing room. Here? People, you know... The ones who are chosen... The ones who are easy to carry and transport. The inside of the head, from there up to the middle of the spine. Next, for a period of days before the expiration of the necessary guts... That's it... Other than that, everything else gets scraped off while you're alive. All sensory organs that hinder the curse are removed... Completely scraped off, compact and small... Wrapped up as just flesh and skin... You're packed inside one of these... ...filled with drugs to manipulate your ecstasy and fear... ...suffering as curse-repellent until the day you die. The product of the experiments that Mitty and I suffered... This is what he calls a cartridge... Nanachi... I... He was frightening to the very core... ...I lost to that fear... ...and helped to make these things. The day prior... ...they would be saying how cute and fluffy I was as I led them by the hand... ...their eyes were full of wonder towards the Abyss... "It hurts! It hurts!" They would cry out... ...as I diligently removed parts of them to be thrown away! Pretending not to see... how many... ...with these hands, how many! How many! Damn it... What have I been doing this whole time!? Hey, Bondrewd! Wonderful. Even under extreme circumstances, your sensitivity and capacity to learn did not wane. You are truly worthy of the blessing. Now, Nanachi... There are plenty of fun things waiting for you... Please come and help. Why should it be like that... ...you insane fiend. Bastard, are you planning to pack Prushka, just so you can attain the blessing? Please! Let Prushka go! Please do not worry. Right now, Prushka is sleeping. I shall properly let her go. That aside... I thought you came here to create the raw material for a Life-Reverberating Stone. Life-Reverberating Stone? If I'm not mistaken, that's what the white whistles are cut out from... Since I heard you mention the Immovable Lord, I thought she would have told you a bit. Ah, but she's not very good at handling people. The raw material for the Life-Reverberating Stone... ...is human beings. You're lying, right...? This base used to be the ruins of a ritual site... The part of the Abyss that allows no return, the sixth layer and beyond... Challenging that means yielding yourself to it. This was a place to prepare... ...and to collect sacrifices. Not just anyone can be the offering. If you don't have the will to give everything for the intended user... The life-pattern won't be compatible. The sound made by a white whistle has the power to pull out the true, hidden purposes in artifacts. Not bad, don't you think? I think I get it... You. You've used yourself as a sacrifice for the whistle. Well, well... It's clear you understand. And the experiments related to the cartridges... You discovered them while trying to make a Life-Reverberating Stone, didn't you... You might be closer to our side, than I've ever thought. I understand the aspiration. But for you to go to such an extent is just unforgivable. If you can turn yourself into an artifact... why don't you just make yourself into a cartridge! This is the first me, when I was a human. There-after, we were judged as not living, mindless. Useful for nothing. Unthinkable. Then... then, Prushka...! This has been great for buying time, but he has arrived. Reg... you... My my My my my my. So you're the source of the commotion I've been wondering about. It seems that you've been rather slippery while I wasn't looking. Be careful! He's fully equipped with his cartridges! Well, well. You seem rather excited. What...? That Reg... What's happened to him? Incredible... Meinya!? Nanachi, wait here! Prushka...! I'll... Be there soon...! You sure are bizarre, aren't you? You've even sucked up the power reserves. Instead of electrical power, it might be more appropriate to say that you've taken in strength. I want to see your true power. Gangway. He deflected it! Sparagmos. Ah... ...how wonderful. I very much regret... ...having removed one of your arms. That body... I... ...Desire it... Reg... What's happened to you? Instead of losing your memories... You've become something else entirely...! But... but...! You're able to keep up with Bondrewd! I would love to see more of your tricks, however... it will be problematic if more of my equipment gets broken. Far Caress. Close. Reg! Shit... His cartridges are scattering consciousnesses... I can't predict his movements...! Nanachi! What are you doing at a time like this!? I found it! Zoaholic! I haven't found Prushka though... Also, near it... Seriously...! Listen Riko, Don't show it to me. In the unlikely event- Nanachi? The incinerator...? The force field is calming down...? The incinerator...? The force field is calming down...? No, so much destruction... It's tensing in preparation...! This... What is this enveloping light? What is he...? Riko! Run! Away from us! You must not, Nanachi! Are you stupid!? Don't you dare forget about what you treasure! STOP! What... Was that? Nanachi! I... What have I... ...done? Give me a break... You've made quite the show Nanachi! Riko, are you safe? I'm fine! Is that so. Come back here. It's safe you know. What happened to you? I can remember up until I took the power; however... I felt that there were a number of people inside me... and then, one of them took control of my body... Thank you, Nanachi! I came back thanks to you! So my words reached you... No, uh... Your fluffiness... Give me a break... Here, put this in your ear. A communication device? Even though the previous one was on your helmet, it's gone now. Also... What happened to him...? I don't know... I wonder if he got caught up in it... Please, accompany me down here. R... Reg...! Damn, where... is this...? Did I fall from all the way up there...? What are these...!? Shako. Ethan. Sumiko. Pueru... They all have names, you know. You're unhurt...! Well, is it not you that made the decision to do so? Huh? What are you talking about? Oh my? So you weren't conscious... The destruction of the scaffolding is certainly unwelcome. Your light... is rather too dangerous... Now. In this place, both your light and my masterpieces... Can be put to the test. Show me more. Then entrust me with it. These Narehate... ...used to be...! More... This is surprising. You're even more agile then when you were being slippery. I'm surprised myself... Someone made me remember... How to use this body... If I fail to stop him now, our adventure will end here. So it has begun. Reg... Reg! Nanachi... You've already fired your incinerator so I'll tell you our last strategy. I see... What a crap-shoot. Oh my. Even though I was hoping you'd co-operate. How cold of you. His cartridges allow him to overcome the curse of the sixth layer. They aren't unlimited. Focus on avoiding him. Don't think of beating him. As long as Zoaholic exists, he's immortal. Right now that Bon has free reign You won't be able to him him with the incinerator due to its wind up. No matter what, return before you hit your time limit. My my... So it's the end for Renshma. She was such a kind-hearted person. She dreamed of becoming a princess, you know. Cute, isn't she. The base's water bastion is caving in! Be careful! Reg! Reg! Ahh... This is... ...truly the blessing of the Abyss. Takiri. Treitia. Nopero... Aah... It has truly been a wonderful adventure, hasn't it? Prushka... What... ...are you saying? That's...? But... Prushka... Prushka... When she thought about you... She cried! My, my, my... A strange thing to say towards the person whom you wish to kill... Come. Preparations have been made so that we may step into the next 2000 years. Let us witness the dawn, together. Who cares... about the dawn! As if there is any reason... to force your own daughter into becoming something like that! Let's go Nanachi! Yeah! Continue the plan! Riko... can you hear me? Riko... please respond! Riko! Uh... Prushka... Prushka... It hurts... ...it hurts... It hurts... How is she, Gueira? This is a difficult one, sir. She's so affected by the curse, even her ego is affected. Here, look. Do you know who you are? She may be a daughter of an Umbra hand... The survival of a miscarriage... Making use of her would be too much trouble. Shouldn't we just kill this one? A prayer cannot be born out of those who know nothing but joy. Oh child of suffering, cursing life itself... Certainly there is something that only you can do. Prushka shall be your name. A word that means the flower of dawn. Papa. I'm Papa. Prushka. Come on, Prushka! It's medicine time. Come out. Gueira, how is she? She's been like this the whole time. Prushka, today I've brought a friend with me. Meina Stoirim... A child of change, we call it. Meinya... Oh my! Does it interest you? Don't put it in your mouth, okay? Oh, she's coming out! Prushka... You've found something that you like. From now on, your world shall begin to change. You, who have cursed the entirety of life, have finally found your first joy. Today is the beginning of your adventure. ...Is that good? ...It's edible? What a waste, right? Even though there is plenty of good food in the Abyss. Good food? Can it be eaten? ...Right. What's good food like? I wonder if it tastes like Meinya? You're smelly. Meinya! Wait up Meinya! Don't go there! Alright! Every fingernail... Her left upper arm... Her teeth are all broken too, it looks like... Her spinal cord didn't get crushed but... I don't know if her mind can be brought back... It's alright. Prushka's mind came from a far deeper place. I am certain she will be as she was. Let us warmly watch over her. My hair... It's all twirly now... Why is Meinya just fine? I have to look into it! It's incredible! If you sniff Meinya's smell, you can see more where you couldn't before! Aren't you tenacious. I wonder if sir is alright with this amount of free reign. It's fine! This is a secret from Papa! ...Oh dear... Meinya! With your all seeing eye, take a good look at my adventures! Now, some very special guests are about to come visit us... they have come to help me. Prushka... I would like you to go accompany them. Right, right. One of them is a daughter of a white whistle too. It will be fine, I am certain you will be friends with them in no time. Come on, Papa... Even though you have me already... Hey Meinya... Those guys... came here all the way form the surface, right...? I wonder, the real dawn... what does it feel like? I'm better at cleaning then they are! It's really amazing! The waterfalls fall upwards! Really! I haven't seen anything like that though... Hey, you know.... I listened I listened to scenes I'd never heard of. About creatures I'd never heard of. Precious comrades... Fun... ...fun! Expressions I'd never made... Words I'd never used... More... ...more! More... together... My arm... My leg... My... ...I wonder what...? It hurts... It hurts... The pain... is increasing... Papa's pain... ...his feelings... ...are flowing into me... My pain is... becoming Papa's strength! Papa... ...I'm going with you. No matter how hard it gets... No matter how dark the night becomes. We'll overcome them, together! So these claws... can pierce through at thin spots. Your body is still too sturdy... but it's helpful your vitals are in the same place as a humans. You said... ...my pain... ...is fake... ...didn't you...!? Indeed, you truly are well made. Even your insides feel warm. If my pain... is fake, then... I can still move...! I'll have you know... that this intent... is not a fake one...! That's why, Papa... Just one thing. I wonder if it's alright to wish for just one thing. Reg! Riko! NOW! I... I... ...want to make up with them. So, don't fight with each other... Because I want us to go on an adventure together... Together... On an adventure... Reg! Reg...! Damn! Don't die! ...Nanachi... Don't talk...! I'm going to heal you... Nanachi... Your hand... I've... calmed down a bit... Sorry... I'm at my limit... Take care... of Riko... I'm surprised... Being able to activate the detached arm... and decisively unleash all of its power... Well done... Truly moving... Enough of your needless talk. I know, just how much effort you spent on attaining that body of yours. And you have no Umbra hands left that can stop us. We'll destroy the rest of your equipment and the Zoaholic as well. You've multiplied so much, you won't truly die even if we kill you... But... Your ambition ends here. Serves you right. I do not mind. Your prayers... your wishes have chosen your own path, to move towards. One that is superior compared to how mine is. Indeed, it is a shame that this body has been destroyed. However, meeting you... crossing paths with you... has brought me an irreplaceable joy... For you to be able to push further beyond here... That is my new aspiration. It's useless saying anything to you, huh. Damn you... There is no way I'd pity you... I've always been dreaming of the day where I'd bring you down with me.... Ah... I am glad... That it didn't turn out like that... Truly... Now... Nanachi... Raise your face... May... May your journey... Be overflowing with curses and blessings... Shut up... Ah, you truly are... ...cute, aren't you. It's ironic... that I have to fall for your sugar-coated words. You know, I... You finally woke up... I'm really glad... Nanachi... I checked inside but it looks like your organs aren't hurt. From the looks of things, you'll probably be fine. We... really did it... Yeah. There are still some Umbra Hands left, but they don't have the strength to bother us anymore. That's go... Huh? No...! Reg! Your navel! I'm just fine and also... Prushka, you know! Even though she's this warm... Look! Even though her heart still beats... Huh...? Her heartbeat...? It hurts to be upright? NO! Prushka is spilling...! What...? Prushka... Is that... really...? Is that... I feel it... I wonder why...? Strange... Hey, what is it? My belly's hot... what is this...? A Life-Reverberating Stone. For real... But, as long as the packed subject doesn't desire you... This means... For her to be able to think of another person... while receiving the curse... Also... it was such a short period too... Prushka... Riko... Lend it to me for a moment. Here. Well, it's not good.. if we leave it uncovered... Na... Nanachi... This might feel rather complicated... but without a doubt... being entrusted to Riko is Prushka's will. No one but you can use it. It's terribly misshapen, but... it is your white whistle. Nanachiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii....! I'm guessing you have about ten shots left? Oh yeah, I didn't eat anything... Sorry, I ate my fill. The base still doesn't have any power. Both of you, ready? You... eating, crying, what a busy person... Hey, Nanachi... That bastard. The mask... we should have destroyed it. Is it fine? We talked about it. After that... I'm respecting our captains will. Come on, hurry! Our adventure, is about to begin! To those who devote themselves to challenge the Abyss, all shall return. Life, death... Curses and blessings, the entirety of it all. Prushka, shall we go? At the end of your journey what ending shall you find? The ones who shall decide... ...are those who dare to challenge it. Finally... The last dive! Yes, finally. It's the beginning of the final journey. Let's go! No matter how dark it gets, don't worry! You're very bright after all. Riko, keep moving forward!
