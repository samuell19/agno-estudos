Come. My lecture isn’t finished. You’ll have plenty of time to finish. Bring the blanket. Why do you want to visit the orchard in the dark? I want to see your naked skin glow in the moonlight. I suppose Guido da Montefeltro can wait. Have you ever made love in an orchard before? Then I’m glad I’m your first. You’re my last, Gabriel. My only. What if someone sees us? These woods are private. You’re very good at that. There’s no one here but us. "To the Nuptial Bowre I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav’n, And happie Constellations on that houre." Paradise Lost. But in this place, I can only think of Paradise found. This is where I discovered true beauty. I have something for you. It’s beautiful. I’d like to have a child with you. What? So soon? Dante lost Beatrice when she was 24. Losing you would be devastating. No morbid talk. Not here, after we’ve celebrated life and love. It’s too soon for a baby, Gabriel. We’ve only been married six months and I want to finish my PhD. Agreed. But when we get back from Europe, I would like to speak to my doctor. It’s been so long since my vasectomy, a reversal might not be possible. There’s more than one way to make a family. We could adopt. When the time is right. We can do all those things. When you’re ready, we’ll start trying. We should probably practice a lot in preparation. Mmm, absolutely. There you are. What’s wrong? I woke up early. I need to make up the bedrooms and clean the bathrooms. Then I need to go shopping and plan the meals, and... I’m not even dressed. You don’t need to do anything. I’ll find somebody who can clean the house and I will go to the grocery store after my run. You go back to bed. You need to work on your lecture. But sleep first. A tired mind doesn’t work very well. Thank you. Well, hello there. What are you reading? "The Way of a Pilgrim." - Is it good? - Very. It’s about a Russian Orthodox man who tries to learn what it means to pray without ceasing. Are you praying for something? For a good many things. To become a good man, a good husband, and, someday, a good father. I suppose we’re all on our own spiritual journeys. Some of us are further along than others. I don’t think of it like that. Hmm? I think we chase God until He catches us. One of the things I admire most about you is your compassion for human frailty. I have my own vices, Gabriel. They’re just hidden. The house looks great. Thank you. I was able to get a lot of work done today. And thanks for making dinner. You weren’t hungry when I brought it up to you. I ran into a problem with my paper. - Can I help? - No. If I present a paper that sounds like you wrote it, people will notice. Christa has already been spreading rumors about us. Christa is just jealous. She’s going backwards in her career. You haven’t let me read your paper. Although we’ve discussed Guido so much I’m sure I know what you’ll say. Has my book been helpful? Yes. But I’m taking a different tack. I’ll let you read it tomorrow. I’m worried about what you’ll think. I’ll be honest, but supportive. I promise. - Now... - Hm? I need you to take me to bed and cheer me up. Hmm... What would cheering you up entail? Taking my mind off my troubles by tantalizing me with your body. What if I’m not ready for bed? I guess I’ll have to go to bed by myself. And maybe cheer myself up. You can’t present this! Why not? You’re wrong. St. Francis comes for the soul of Guido after he dies. You agreed with me. I changed my mind. I sent you an illustration of the scene while we were separated. Now you’re going to stand in front of a room full of people and say that it never happened? If you read my footnotes, you’d... None of your sources go as far as you. You’re merely speculating. Merely? Professor Marinelli liked my paper. She’s too easy on you. Too easy? And I suppose you think Professor Picton invited me to the conference merely out of charity? Of course not. But I don’t want you to get up in front of senior professors and offer a naïve interpretation. - If you’d read my book, you’d... - I read your book, Professor. You only mention the text I’m analyzing in passing. And you naïvely adopt the standard interpretation. I never naïvely adopt anything. Don’t you want me to have my own ideas? Or do I have to repeat what everyone else has already said? I never said that. But you could benefit from my experience. Oh, here we go. What do you mean, here we go? What do you mean, here we go? You’re just upset that I’m going to disagree with you in public. - Bullshit. - Bullshit? Then why are you telling me to change my paper so I fall in line with your book? I’m trying to help so you won’t make a... What was that? If you start now, you should be able to rewrite your paper in time for the conference. I can’t change my thesis. They’ve already published the abstract on the conference website. This isn’t the time to be stubborn. Oh, yes, it is. It’s my paper! Julianne, listen. Julianne, listen to me, please. Stop. We can talk about this. I’m not your student anymore. - Damn it. Stop! - Don’t yell at me! I’m sorry. Let’s sit down and talk. I can’t talk to you right now without saying something I’m going to regret. I’m going to avoid you for the rest of the day. Rachel, Aaron, and Richard are arriving soon. What will I tell them? Tell them I’m an idiot. Obviously. Julianne, listen to me. Please. Fine! Our first fight and you lock yourself in the God damned bathroom. My first public lecture and you tell me it’s shit! - Hey, everyone. - Hey! - Hi. - Hi. Where’s Julia? Working on her paper. Jules! Get your ass down here! Rachel, please. Dad, you’re welcome to stay in your old room. I’ll be fine in the guest room. You and Julia fighting? You can say hello when you go upstairs. I’m barbecuing ribs for dinner. Ribs? Fantastic. They’re fighting. What could they be fighting about? I don’t know, maybe Julia rearranged his collection of bow ties without asking him. - Hey. - Rach! Hi! So what’s up with you and Gabriel? There’s like a tension in the house. And I don’t need to be a psychic to pick up on it. Do you want me to go beat him up for you? No. I made the mistake of letting him read the lecture I’ve been working on. He told me it’s terrible. What is wrong with him? I would have thrown something at his head. I thought about it, but I didn’t want to have to clean up the blood. He said he was trying to help. I don’t want him too lie. If the paper needs work, I need to know that. He should know how to help you without telling you that your paper is terrible. Exactly. He says he wants to start a family with me. Then he turns around and acts like a condescending ass. Wait a minute! He wants kids? Yes. I’m so happy for you! When are you going to start trying? We agreed to wait until I graduate. It would be too difficult to work on a PhD and have a baby. We’d like to have a baby. - What, now? - Maybe. If I learned anything from losing my mother, it’s that life is uncertain. I don’t want to wait to start a family and then lose my chance. What if I get cancer? Having kids is one way to rid Gabriel of his condescending attitude. Why’s that? Are you kidding? He will be begging for help when a baby empties a dirty diaper on him! Hmm... He’s come a long way... Married and talking about starting a family? When my parents first brought Gabriel home, he’d hide food in his room. He didn’t unpack his bags, either. He kept expecting them to send him away. I didn’t know that. It’s remarkable. My advice is to talk to him. But, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to let him sweat just a little bit. Make him sleep on the couch. Lord, please bless this food to our use and we to thy service and let us ever be mindful of the needs of others. Amen. - Begin. - Thanks, Dad. Excuse me. Coffee? Yes, thanks. Man, suck it up and tell her you’re sorry. Why are you assuming I’m at fault? Statistically speaking... Apologize. Et tu, Brute? I didn’t say anything. But, there’s a reason that older married couples will tell young ones not to let the sun go down on their anger. I’m not the one who shut down rational communication. She’s not irrational. She’s hurt. And when someone hurts you, it’s rational to withdraw. Especially given her history. I didn’t mean to hurt her. I’m sure that’s true. But I’m also confident that you don’t fight fairly. My advice is to be gentle with your wife. I’m sorry. Forgive me. Please, let me in. Hi. I’m sorry, Julianne. You hurt me. I know. I’m sorry. I reread your paper. You forgot something important. Can I come in? I said some things yesterday I shouldn’t have. Thank you. I have some suggestions on how to improve your paper. I know it’s important that you stand on your own two feet. But I’m happy to help, if you need me. I’d welcome your advice, as long as you don’t tell me what to think. Your ideas are one of the many things that I love about you. The story of Francis risking Hell to save Guido’s soul represents what I was trying to do when I made my confession to the disciplinary committee back in Toronto. I was reacting to what I took to be your dismissal of the story. Our story. I never meant to dismiss something so important. If the situation had been reversed, I would have descended to Hell to rescue you. I was a bastard. Then and now. May I? I didn’t mean to hurt you. I know. I’m sorry, too. I don’t like fighting with you. I don’t like it either. I didn’t set out to disagree with you in my paper. It just... sort of happened. Come here. I promise not to be a selfish bastard, if you promise not to lock yourself in the bathroom to get away from me. I promise not to lock myself in the bathroom, if you can give me space. We can take a break during an argument, but if we promise to talk later on. Agreed. Your paper changed my mind. It’s good. What? You heard me. Although I have some suggestions on how you can strengthen the last part. You didn’t quite convince me there. I could use a few pointers. I’ll give you credit in the footnotes. I’d be honored to appear in one of your footnotes. Thank you. It’s hard for me to be a student in the same field as you. We aren’t in competition. I’m proud of you for having the courage of your convictions. When you defend your paper at Oxford, I’ll be sitting in the front row thinking, "That’s my girl." It’s a dream come true, to hear you say that. Then I’ll keep saying it. Oh! Something’s cooking but it ain’t the apple pie. The coffee is ready and the pie is cooling. What’s the hold up? We were just making coffee. Oh, I bet you were. I’ll leave you ladies to it. So what was cooking? And please tell me you didn’t use the counters. Too cold. How’s married life, Tammy? I never thought it would happen. Why not? Before Scott, I was living with someone. And we talked about getting married, then I got pregnant and he decided he wasn’t ready. - Asshole. - I’m so sorry. I’ll never forgive Eric for signing away his parental rights. Because Quinn will never know his father. Sperm donors are not fathers. I mean, Richard didn’t contribute genetic material to Gabriel, but he’s his father. Gabriel is so nice. Even when Quinn ruined his suit. You should have seen him before he met Julia. He would have handed Quinn the dry cleaning bill. I can’t imagine that. He’s so wonderful with Quinn. Hi. I think it’s bedtime. - Hey, sweetie! - I know. Say goodnight. Bye-bye. Aw... I guess I’d better take the men their dessert. Can we talk for a minute, honey? Of course. So, I’ve been spending a lot of time with your father. I love him and he loves me. And we’ve been talking about the future. About making things permanent. That’s great! If you and Dad get married, I’ll be there. You’ll more than just be there. You’ll be one of my bridesmaids. What’s all this? Diane was just telling me how much she loves you. Is that so? Not that you’ve asked, but you have my blessing. Is that so? Well... My girls. Richard... I thought we’d agreed that you’d call me Dad. Of course, Dad. Does it bother you that we’ve changed things? Inside the house? Grace would like what you’ve done in the kitchen. You know, something when I’m inside the house... I swear I can hear her voice. I don’t feel her when I’m in Philadelphia. Oh... Here. Thank you. Do you like living in Philadelphia? My research position hasn’t gone as expected. I’m thinking about retiring. Move back. Live here. Oh, no. This is your home now. We’re only here during vacations. We could switch bedrooms immediately. It’s very kind of you to offer, but I sold the house to Gabriel. It would be a mitzvah for us. And we need the blessing. What sort of blessing do you need? I have an unanswered prayer. All prayers are answered. Sometimes the answer is no. I can’t pretend that the thought of moving back here doesn’t tempt me. As long as the house is in the family, it doesn’t matter who owns it. Gabriel would never part with the orchard. It would relieve him to know it’s in capable hands. You’d be helping us out. Care to join me? I prefer to watch. Then I’ll be sure to put on a show. Oh, I left my bubble bath in the guest bathroom. Would you mind getting it for me? Not at all. Goddess. What’s the matter? Is Rachel pregnant? Not that I know of. I found an empty box for a pregnancy test in the bathroom. It was probably her. I wish it were you. Our time will come. You look as if you want to lick me. All over. I do. Mmm. Confide in me. You tend to take bubble baths when you’re stressed. And you’ve been taking them daily. I’m worried about grad school and flunking out. I’m worried about my lecture. We’ve spoken about your lecture. It’s good. You have to take grad school one semester at a time. You don’t have to entertain our relatives. They will entertain themselves. You work on your paper, I’ll make dinner. Thank you. My dad and Diane are talking about getting married. How do you feel about that? I’d like him to have someone to grow old with. You’ll have your birthday when we get to Italy. How would you like to celebrate it? With you. In bed. For a couple of days. Would you like to invite people to the exhibition in Florence? No. I want you all to myself. We can invite them to Cambridge for your birthday. I don’t like making a big deal about my birthday. 25 is a milestone birthday. So is 35. My milestones are important only because of you. Without you, they’d be empty days. Do you have to be so sweet? Since I’ve been eaten sour most of my life, yes. I believe this is a room we haven’t christened yet. I’ve missed this. Holding you in the dark. Hearing your voice. I’ve been healed. And it was more wonderful than you can imagine. I’m sorry I didn’t realize you were sick. I should have noticed. It was my time. Oh... there’s so much I want to show you. But not yet. Rest, my love. I am moving back here. I’ll arrange the movers. We’ll make sure to get our furniture out of the master bedroom. No. The guest room is mine now. Grace will be with me wherever I sleep. Lovely. What the hell are those? I think they are beds. We’re checking into a hotel. You promised. Nigel promised me a room with a double bed and an en-suite. Where’s the double bed? Where’s the en-suite? We’ll have to share the bathroom... We’ll be at the conference most of the time. C.S. Lewis was inspired by those statues when he wrote "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe." That’s what they say. Do you think his ghost ever wanders around here? I doubt he’d haunt a place like this. He’s probably at the pub. Sex is almost impossible. There isn’t enough space. That isn’t how I remember it. Is that a challenge, Mrs. Emerson? Are you worried about your paper? Do you think if I asked C.S. Lewis to intercede on my behalf, he’d pray for me? Lewis was a Protestant. He didn’t believe in petitioning the saints. What if people ask why you left Toronto? We’ll say I wanted to be in Boston because you were going to Harvard and we were getting married. Christa Peterson’s been telling a different story. Forget about her. We don’t have to worry about her at this conference. But academics get bored and like to talk. Nothing is more exciting than a sex scandal. I beg to differ, Mrs. Emerson. Sex with you is more exciting than a scandal. I wondered where you went. I read the Narnia books. They were special to me. I read them, too. There was a closet in my mother’s apartment that I was convinced would open Narnia if I was a good boy. Clearly, I wasn’t. I know what it’s like to be willing to do anything to make the stories real. I said to you once that you were not my equal, but my better. I’m afraid you didn’t believe me. It’s difficult to believe you think that, sometimes. I need to do a better job showing you. But I’m not sure how. There is The Eagle and Child pub. This is a dream come true. You’ve worked very hard. This is your reward. I wonder what kind of trouble we can get into in that museum. Fuck. I’m settling this once and for all. You can’t. Not here. Trouble in Paradise? I guess the honeymoon didn’t last very long. Not that I’m surprised. I’d like a word, Miss Peterson. Not after what happened in Toronto. If you want to say something, you’ll have to say it in front of witnesses. I learned a few things after you resigned. BDSM. I didn’t know Professor Singer was your Domme. Let’s go. Please. I’m looking forward to your paper, Julianne. It’s unusual for a first-year student to be included. However did you manage it? Professor Picton invited me. Wouldn’t it be better to invite Gabriel to speak? Or maybe he simply wrote your paper for you. I do my own research. Your "research" won’t help you write a lecture. Not unless you plan on telling us about all the Harvard professors you slept with. That’s enough. You don’t speak to my wife. Do you understand? Temper, temper, Gabriel. It’s Professor Emerson. Let’s go. For me. What is the meaning of this? Who are you? I’m Christa Peterson, from Columbia. I’m familiar with the faculty from Columbia. You’re not one of them. I’m a graduate student. Ah. Then you’re not from Columbia. You attend Columbia. Why are you here? Professor Picton, excuse me. The young lady is a friend. You need to teach her some manners. I’m aware of the havoc you wreaked in Toronto. You’ll follow the rules of decorum here, or I’ll have you thrown out. Do you understand? If your guest is unpleasant in any way, I will hold you personally responsible. I have an unforgiving memory. Capisce? Certo, Professor. I’m the injured party here. When I was in Toronto, Gabriel... Codswallop! I’m old, not senile. I recognize a woman scorned when I see one. Everyone else here should, too. This is not a fraternity party. Dear friends, it is good to see you. I shall buy you a drink this evening. You and I shall have a little chat. Why don’t you join us for dinner? Thank you, but I’ll speak with Julianne first. We should have walked away. You stood up for yourself. I’m not going to stand there and let her call you a whore. I asked you to stop. Let’s not fight because of that bitch. That’s what she wants. She was spoiling for a fight, and you gave it to her. If I’d done nothing, then it would look like I agreed with her. I asked you to stop, and you brushed me off. I’m your wife. Not a speed bump. In this paper, I shall catalogue Dante’s use of the number three throughout the Divine Comedy. I shall argue that Il Poeta is identifying the number of completion in nature, animality and humanity, as well as in the structure and organization of the afterlife. This repetition should be seen as Dante’s assertion that completion and perfection underlie all of God’s creation, including that of the underworld. The first most significant use of the number three occurs in Dante’s division of the Comedy into three books: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. I don’t want to fight. I’m sorry. Thank you for defending me. I’m sorry she mentioned Professor Payne. only to be replaced by the third... Emerson was an ass. But he hopes you forgive him. Indeed, just as three beasts threaten Dante’s progress, so the three Guides ensure and defend it. The three Theological virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity appear in Dante’s Paradiso. The poet himself must pass three examinations on the virtues, administered by the three apostles St. Peter, St. James, and St. John. I’m sorry I embarrassed you. I promise I’ll do better. You’re not a speed bump. You’re my Beatrice. Two Caledonian ales, please. Enjoy. Did Gabriel ever explain to you how I came to be in his debt? He mentioned something about doing you a favor, but he wasn’t specific. Six years ago, I received an e-mail from an old friend at Oxford. He told me our former professor, John Hutton, was in hospice, dying. He was one of the sources for my paper. Well, when I received the news, I approached Jeremy Martin and asked to take a week off. Jeremy Martin was an ally to both of you. He tried very hard to help. I wondered why he helped Christa transfer to his alma mater. There were rumors they were involved. I expect better from you than to listen to gossip. I’m so sorry. You’re right. Christa Peterson couldn’t attract Jeremy’s eye if she were standing naked, holding an original manuscript of The Decameron and a case of beer. Well, when I explained my situation to Gabriel, he volunteered to take over for me while I was away. It turned out, I was away for four months. I didn’t know that. I never explained to Gabriel why it was so important for me to see John before he died. I don’t see a reason to keep this a secret anymore. I don’t expect you to hide things from your husband, but I would ask that you be discreet. Of course, Professor. Old Hut, who was married, and I were involved while I was his student. No one found out about us, but there were rumors and they followed me for ten years. Someone wrote to the University of Cambridge, claiming that the only reason Old Hut wrote me a letter of recommendation for me was simply because I was sleeping with him. I’m so sorry. That isn’t funny. Of course it’s funny. You should have seen the letter of recommendation he wrote. "Miss Picton is competent in the study of Dante." I was his lover, for God’s sake. You think he could trouble himself to write more than one sentence? When you have your faculty position, all these rumors will be forgotten. That’s six years away, Professor. Considering all that I’ve shared with you, I think you could call me Katherine. Thank you, Katherine. You need to be more assertive, academically. Don’t let yourself be ravaged by wolves like some diseased moose. You mustn’t let your husband defend you. It makes you look helpless. Chivalry in academia is dead. Dessert? Excuse me. Ladies’ Room. She needs rest. The poor girl is worn out. Yes. You cannot be Julianne’s champion at academic conferences. Let her brightness shine. That’s all I want. Good. Now, I hope when I give my lecture in January at Harvard I’ll be invited to your home for dinner. Greg Matthews always takes me to these appalling molecular gastronomy restaurants that serve deconstructed entrées cooked in liquid nitrogen. I never know whether I’m having dinner or sitting for an exam in organic chemistry. I need the room tomorrow night. I’ll be entertaining. You’d take someone to your bed so soon? The sheets will still be warm. Don’t judge me. You’re married. Who I fuck is none of your business. Such a dirty mouth, Cristina. I wondered why you insisted I bring you. You’re here for revenge. We’re both getting what we wanted. Be careful, Cristina. You don’t want Professor Picton as an enemy. I don’t care. Fuck! Don’t you understand the patronage system? Departments around the world are filled with her admirers. Your chair at Columbia was her student. Too late. I’ve already pissed her off. I’m responsible for you, so you will stop. I’m trying to get a position in America. I don’t need Professor Picton making trouble. Fine, but I need the room tomorrow. So, who is the man you fuck tomorrow? A priest? A professor? Who said it was a man? Then I expect you to share. Wake up, darling. You need to get ready. You kept me up late. Mmm. You smell of sex... And me. You can’t deliver a lecture at Oxford smelling of sex. Watch me. You look lovely. And you’re going to be fine. I’m going to get a coffee. What would you like? Water. See you in there. Hello, Professor. What do you want? You wanted to talk. So... Talk. I want the slander to stop or I’ll sue you. For what? Telling the truth? There’s no truth to your character assassinations. You’re forgetting the part where you fucked one of your students and were placed on administrative leave. Not to mention Professor Singer had quite a bit to say about you. You’re playing with fire. Oh, I hope so, Professor. You keep your mouth shut. Or I’ll make your life a living hell. The power to end this is in your hands. Actually, it’s a bit lower. For fuck’s sake. Come to my hotel and tomorrow, you won’t have to worry about my talented mouth anymore. I know you. I know what you like and I know what you want. No. Then what happens next is on your conscience. You stay away from my wife, do you hear me? I’m at the Malmaison. I brought handcuffs... Come before midnight. Give my best to your wife. It’s so good to see you. Angelfucker. Professor Emerson. Paul. Shake hands, gentlemen. I didn’t know you were coming. I wasn’t. One of the presenters backed down, so Professor Picton invited me. I’m giving the paper just before Julia’s. That’s great. Congratulations. Can I take you to lunch? I’m afraid she already has plans. I’d love to go to lunch with you. Thank you. Hello, Mr. Norris. Mr. Norris and I are having dinner this evening. I’d like for you and Julianne to join us. We’d be delighted. Since we’ll be dining with you this evening, I’ll claim my wife for lunch. Very well. I want to go to lunch with him. Over my dead body. He wants you. Paul is not someone who would make a pass at a married woman. This conference is like a tour through the various levels of Hell. It’s just lunch. Good afternoon. Why Ugolino’s feast will never end. The bestial nature of Ugolino is dramatically depicted in Auguste Rodin’s sculpture, "Ugolino and His Children." This piece forms piece of Rodin’s larger work, The Gates of Hell and has a prominent position in that commission. Rodin sculpts Ugolino as he crawls over the figures of his dying children. His form both animalistic and grotesque. But Rodin has captured Ugolino just before... How’s your dad? He’s better. Thanks for the flowers. I heard about Julia’s wedding. Your mom told my mom. She’s clearly a fool. Uh... She isn’t, but thanks. Do you want to go to a movie? I mean, sometime. Not right now. It’s too early to go to a movie right now. I don’t know. I don’t want things to be weird between us. We always promised each other we’d be friends. Things are just... difficult right now. Look, I’m not trying to rope you into something. I really want to be friends. Hey. Relax. We have a history, Allison. And it’s a good one. But I don’t want to jump back into something with you right now. You deserve to be with someone who’s serious and not half in it. So, are we on for that movie sometime? I might even take you to dinner, now that I’m pulling in the big bucks as a teacher. Only if I can take you to breakfast right now. Should we wait here? Excuse me, I have to use the bathroom. I can’t wait to hear your paper. I’m sure I’ll have a few questions. Your vendetta is ridiculous. I never did anything to you. You have something I want and I always get what I want. I don’t understand what he sees in you. Gabriel is beautiful. He’s a legend. All the women at Lobby knew him and wanted to fuck him. He needs to be with a woman whose appetite is as voracious as his. He is. Hardly. I’m sure he enjoyed the conquest, but now his eyes will wander. He’s probably cheated already. Love. What? What Gabriel sees in me. The answer is love. I know about the other women. They aren’t a threat. You’re delusional. Why would he want a vanilla little mouse when he could have a tiger in his bed? Better a loving mouse than an indifferent tiger. Those women didn’t see who he truly is. They didn’t care that he was miserable. They would have used him until there was nothing left and then thrown him away. I have loved him since I was seventeen. I love all of him, the light and the dark. That is why he’s with me. So do your worst, Christa. But if you’re planning to seduce my husband, you will fail. You’re right about one thing, though. My husband is an exceptional lover. Absolutely mind-blowing. And tonight and every night, the woman enjoying his adventurous nature will be me. Not bad for a mouse. You look good. Much better than the last time I saw you. Married life agrees with me. You all right? I’ve just noticed the Rabbit’s gone. About time, don’t you think? I’ll miss her. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. Sorry. Table for two by the window? Maybe we could trade tables with the little girl? She might like to look out the window. Thank you. Maia, we can sit by the window. Isn’t that nice? We can look at the pumps. Come on. Thank you. Are you planning on having a Maia of your own anytime soon? No. Um, not yet, I mean... Do you want to share? Sure, the lunch special and appetizer platter look good. Tired? A little. My eyes bother me sometimes. You should get your eyes checked. Lots of grad students end up with eyestrain. Do you wear glasses? No, I drank a lot of milk growing up. It helps vision. I thought carrots did that. Milk helps everything. Are you seeing anyone? Ali and I go out occasionally, but it’s casual. She’s nice. She cares about you. I want you to be happy. How are things going in your program? The professors are tough. I’m working all the time, but I love it. Do you go out at all? Rarely. It’s awkward because the other students invite their partners and Gabriel doesn’t think it’s a good idea for him to socialize with grad students. He wants to have a baby. And you don’t? I want to finish my program. I’m worried if we have a baby, I’ll never graduate. Have you told him? Yes. He said he understood. But once you express that kind of desire, it can’t be taken back. Jules, if you aren’t ready for a family, say so. Otherwise, you’re gonna end up miserable. I don’t think having a baby with my husband would make me miserable. Dropping out of Harvard would. If your husband loves you, then he needs to wake the fuck up and drop the whole barefoot-and-pregnant bullshit. He doesn’t want that. I’m not the only person whose dreams count. It’s hard for me to see you with him. When is he going to realize he married an incredible woman and that he needs to care for her? He does care for me. He’d give me the world if he could fit it in his pocket. I’m the one who’s struggling. It’s hard to withhold something from someone you love, knowing it would make him happy. And I’m happy, Paul. Truly. Bon apetit. She is a rising star at Harvard. Please welcome Julianne Emerson. Thank you, Professor Patel. The title of my presentation is "The Silence of St. Francis: A Witness to Fraud." In canto 27 of Dante’s Inferno, Guido da Montefeltro tells the story of what happened after he died. "Francis came afterward, when I was dead, for me; "but one of the black Cherubim said to him: "’Take him not; do me no wrong; "he must come down among my servitors, Because he gave the fraudulent advice." Guido sought absolution for the sin of fraudulent counsel before he committed the sin. He believed absolution would free him from the consequences of his sin. Francis could have called him a liar for presenting a false account of his appearance. Instead of fighting to preserve his good name, Francis is quiet so the evil can be heard for exactly what it is. Guido would have us believe that Francis confronted a demon but lost, because he wasn’t smart enough to best the demon in a match of logic. In my view, he comes to the grave of Guido da Montefeltro to mourn him and his life of fraud, not to rescue him. In conclusion, Francis appeared at the death of Guido, but not to steal his soul. If anything, Dante uses Guido as a foil to praise the piety of St. Francis by providing a stark contrast between the two men. Thank you. Thank you. Are there any questions? I have a question. There are so many holes in your paper, I don’t even know where to begin. But let’s start with your research. The majority of papers accept that Francis came for Guido. A few deny that Francis appeared. But no one, no one, believes that Francis appeared but not for Guido’s soul. Either Guido’s lying or he isn’t. It can’t be half and half, like cream. You didn’t even mention Canto 27, where Guido explains to Dante that he’s telling the truth. If you had bothered to read Professor Hutton’s seminal work on the organization of the Inferno, you’d know he thought the demon’s speech was reliable because his words were historically accurate. So Hutton thought that Francis appeared for Guido’s soul, too. Guido says he’s willing to tell the truth because he believes Dante is one of the damned and thus won’t be able to repeat the story. But Guido’s tale is self-serving. He simply doesn’t want to tip his hand by saying so, which is why he gives the speech. You’re forgetting this line: "Ora chi se, "ti priego che ne conte; "non esser duro più ch’altri sia stato, se ’l nome tuo nel mondo tegna fronte." Dante tells Guido he intends to repeat his tale in the world. It’s only after Dante says this that Guido recounts his life story. Also, we know that Dante doesn’t resemble the other shades physically. So it is likely that Guido recognized that Dante wasn’t dead. I think... As for your point about Professor Hutton’s work, your characterization of his position is incorrect. In a footnote he states that he believed Francis appeared because he thinks the words of the demon were directed at someone other than Guido himself. Professor Hutton says he has doubts as to whether Francis appeared for Guido’s soul or for some other reason. - But... - Can we move on? You’ve asked your question and the speaker answered it. Adequately, I might add. I tend to agree with much of what you’ve said, and although I can’t speak for him, I surmise Old Hut would too, if he were here. Thank you, Professor Wodehouse. However, you rather glossed over the agreement that existed between Boniface and Guido. My thesis was on the interpretation of Francis’s appearance, not Guido’s sin. Nevertheless, I’m happy to expand on that part of the paper. When Guido encountered Pope Boniface VIII... Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Emerson. We’ll pause now for tea and coffee. That’s my smart girl. Please join us. - Thank you. - Excuse me. Is there a problem? Fuck it. Professor Picton would like you to be an external reader on my dissertation. Is that something you’d consider? I’ll consider it. I was at UCLA and people were talking about how Julia boinked you in order to graduate and get into Harvard. Those rumors are the fruits of Miss Peterson’s poisonous tree. She will be dealt with, I assure you. You don’t deserve her. You think I don’t know that?! Every night when I fall asleep with her in my arms, I thank God she’s mine. And every morning when I wake up, my first thought is that I’m grateful she married me. I will never be worthy of her. But I will spend every day trying my damnedest. I know you want her. But I’m telling you, you can’t have her. I don’t just want her. I love her. She’s the one. She can’t be the one. She’s my wife! I know. I met a pretty, sweet, Catholic girl. The kind of girl I’ve been looking for my whole life. When I finally asked her to choose me, she couldn’t because she was in love with the asshole that broke her heart and will probably break it again and again. I’ll admit I was an asshole. I’m not that man anymore and I’m sure as hell not going to break her heart again. Then let her finish her program. Let her? Julia feels guilty about making her grad program such a high priority. She told you this? She also said she doesn’t have any friends. How convenient. Are you interested in continuing to be her friend? My friendship with her has to end. She’ll be hurt. Perhaps I should persuade you to change your mind. You can’t. I’ve misjudged you, Paul. And for that, I’m... I’m sorry. It’s time to move on. When I get back to Vermont I’ll write to her. And I’ll tell Katherine I spoke to you and you declined. Mr. Norris! I always intended to be an external reader. Your research stands on its own merits. If I learn that you’ve broken her heart again, we’re going to have a problem. If I break Julianne’s heart, I’ll deserve it. Can we stop touching each other now? Do you feel differently about grad school now? Or are you still enthusiastic about your program? It was an intimidating experience. But I’m glad I did it. I’d like to do it again. Good. You’re gifted, Julianne and I want to do everything in my power to help you succeed. Thank you. That means a lot. In recognition of a job well done. To my beloved with admiration and pride. Gabriel. I’ll be back soon. You were wonderful. Darling? Why are you shy? Sometimes I worry that I’m not adventurous enough for you. That’s a remarkable worry after the past few hours. Christa cornered me just before lunch and said you deserved someone adventurous. Don’t listen to her poisonous bullshit. I told her you deserved love and that’s what I gave you. And that’s certainly true. So why worry? Because I want to keep you. We’re in a competition, then, darling, because I want to do my damnedest to keep you. Good. Our bed is for pleasure. My utmost concern is to please you... and to find my pleasure with you. There are some adventures I’d be willing to explore, if you felt the same way. But you don’t have to worry that I’ll abandon you if you say no. You can always say no. Understand? Yes. Good. Do you still feel shy? No. But I’m wondering... what kind of sexual adventures do you have in mind? I’ll show you. Ah! No, no! - Stop! - Come here. Stop! I’ll teach you something. Come here! Your sister sent me an e-mail. Shh. Quiet, I’m trying to kiss you. This is important. Rachel and Aaron want us to light a candle in Assisi. They want us to pray that they’ll have a baby. I can’t bear to be the one standing between you and your dreams. Darling, nothing could be further from my mind. We can talk about the future and make plans without changing our time line. Ahem. I’ve asked John Green to send Christa a cease and desist letter. The conference went better than expected. Perhaps the slander isn’t as worrisome as we thought. Slander is always worrisome. Oh, damn it. Miss Peterson. I hate to trouble you, Professor Barini, but I need to speak to you about Professor Pacciani.
