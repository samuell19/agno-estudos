(somber music) (birds chirping) (child giggling) (child giggling) (police radio chattering) - Hello, sir? We're ready for you. - Okay. Miller, right? - Yes, sir. - You don't have to call me sir. (dramatic music) (faint police radio chattering) Hey. Is there any coffee here? - I-- - Uh-huh, forget it. So, who called this in? - A jogger ran by this morning. Saw the front door open and floodlights on. - What time was that? - 7:30, 8 A.M. - Is this the first time anybody's been out here? - No, Officer Arteca got called in to investigate a noise disturbance three weeks ago. - Is he around here? - Yeah, he's around here somewhere. - Okay. Oh, may I have some? - Yeah. - Thank you. All right. Let's do it. Another day, another dollar. (ominous music) I guess we should follow the trail. God, it's hot in here. - Sir, you're stepping on the evidence. - What evidence? - All the papers. - No. Just evidence that assholes lived here. - I'm sorry? - Take a look. This is so typical. They just wanna make the bank have to pay somebody to clean this place up. - Is this normal? - [Frank] It happens. - Why would somebody go through all the trouble? - I don't know. - Seems like a lot-- - You know you get pushed into a corner mentally and... (Frank sighing) Anything can seem like a victory. It's about control. People are capable of anything. Leaving the house a mess, putting the kids in the car and fleeing. What else could they do? - He. - Who's he? - The home owner, a Mr. Taylor. A neighbor stated that the wife passed away several years ago, now it's just him and his two daughters. - How old? - 13, 16. - Ah. So he took them and fled. - They didn't have to leave until the 27th. Sir. - Yeah, yeah, I know. - [Man] Okay. Not one, huh? (ominous music) Are you sure? And the payments have been persistent? He hasn't missed one payment? Right. Okay, okay, thank you. - Officer Arteca? - Yes? - What's going on? - Officer Sanders, you have to come down and see this. - [Frank] A glitch? - Not likely. These are pretty foolproof. But sometimes when the power goes out, which it did, it has a backup battery rigged to the system. - Well, his bills are all probably passed due. - I called the alarm company. They said all of his bills are up-to-date. The alarm was set at ll:15 P.M. last night. And he paid all his payments on time. He even paid three months in advance. - Well, that's weird. - Yeah. And he ungraded his service last week. - [Frank] To what? - [Arteca] Their latest package. (siren alarming) - All right, how do you turn this thing off? - I got it. Here, there's a... There's a thing. - I got it, I got it. (phone buzzing) - Is that your phone? - [Miller] Hmmm. - Hello? Yes. I know. I know, I'm at work. (muffled woman speaking on phone) Yeah, sure, I'll be there. No, I did not forget. Okay. Okay, okay. I gotta go. (Frank sighing) I think we're done here. - [Miller] What about the rest of the rooms upstairs? - I gotta go. I've got enough to write up my report. - You didn't even see the rest of the house. So, what do you think? - About what? - What do you think happened to them? - They fled. - They still had 24 days left before they had to leave their house. - They're running from the bank, bills, embarrassment. Their house is in foreclosure. - Isn't it unusual to flee and leave everything behind? All your belongings. I mean, they left even the bare essentials. It really doesn't feel right. - Officer Miller, (phone buzzing) you can read all about it when I submit my report. One in five families were losing their homes. Do you have children? - No. - Okay, then don't try to analyze Mr. Taylor's actions. The man had his reasons. You just have to find them. Oh boy. Hey, Miller. Double check and see if they put out APB yet and do another lap around the neighborhood. See if people know if he has any family in the area. - Right, right, okay. - And you can call my cell any time if something comes up. I'm not gonna be at home the next couple days. - Taking some R and R, sir? - If my daughter will let me. Miller, stop calling me sir. We're equals. (engine rumbling) Hey, I'm here. - [Woman] In the kitchen. - So you'll be back on Monday, right? - Four days. I have missed he last two conferences and I'm starting to get behind at work. You know how that is. - Mmm, yeah. - Here are the keys. There's food in the fridge but you'll probably want to stock up on stuff that you like. Make sure Chelsea eats. She's been skipping most meals. And she has a psychologist appointment tomorrow. - Right. - The trash doesn't need to go out until Thursday, so you don't need to worry about that. - Yeah, I know, I used to live here, remember? - Yeah. - So how's she doing? - She's... She's all right, I think. - What do you mean, you think? - She doesn't really talk to me. - Well, what did the doctor say? - I don't know. - What do you mean, you don't know? - I don't know the details of what they discuss. I take her to the appointment and they speak in private. I respect her privacy. - You're the parent. You should know what's going on in those sessions. - I'm not going to smother her. - [Frank] So what do you know? - Why is it always on me? You're perfectly free to call the doctors yourself. - You were the one who said that you should be the one to handle it. But maybe I should've been involved. - So now you're listening to me. - You don't tell me anything. I can't let you handle it and then be involved when I don't know, I'm not a mind reader, Laurie. - You're never around. - I'm here now. - God, you are so difficult. - [Frank] Tell me something, anything. - Don't act all of a sudden like you care. - My availability is not a measure of how much I care about my daughter. - Our daughter. - [Frank] Jesus Christ. Our daughter. Look, just tell me what you think is really going on. - [Laurie] The doctors say she has PTSD and that once she comes to terms with what really happened she could open up. I still think that Rob kid has something to do with it. - Has she said anything to you? - No. - Are you sure this trip is a good idea? - We can't force her to talk. - There's gotta be something you can do. - We, something we can do. (horn honking) Look, I've gotta go. Listen, just... (dramatic music) Maybe you spending time with her, maybe she'll come back to us. (gentle piano music) (footsteps thumping) (door knocking) - Hey, dinner. Chels. - Yeah? - Dinner. - I'm not hungry. - I cooked, you'll eat. - I'll have it in here. - You can have it at the table. - Mom let's me eat in my room. - In case you haven't noticed, I am not your mother. (fork scratching) Would you stop that, please? Are you really not gonna eat? I never was much of a cook. Your room looks nice. I remember having a lot of pink. Did you decorate it yourself? - Mom helped a little. - That's good. She's good at that kind of stuff. Was it your idea to change it up? - Not really. - Well, change is good. Sometimes. So, I hear you're seeing a guy named Rob. Is he nice to you? - I don't wanna talk about it. - How's school? - I haven't been. - Do you wanna go back? - Yeah, maybe. - I remember you used to always draw a lot of cats. Why didn't we ever get you one? - Mom's allergic. - Oh yeah. I think allergies is your body's way of... Has the doctor prescribed something for that? - For what? - That thing behind your ear. Might be contagious. You don't wanna give it to somebody else. You're really not gonna eat? - No. You can have it. What? - [Girl] Rude! Come on. We are going out tonight. - Out, where? - [Girl] A party, come on. - What party? - [Girl] It's gonna be small. - I don't think I'm coming. - No, you're coming. We haven't seen you. - Anne, I don't want to. - [Anne] No! No. No! Not taking that as an answer. 10 minutes. (phone beeping) - I honestly don't know what to say to her. I don't wanna fight. I'm trying as hard as I can. Well, did he give you any advice? I mean, what is this damn doctor doing anyway? Yeah, yeah, I'm sure it takes time. I don't know to get her to talk. All right. Okay. I've never been good at this stuff, you know that. Look, she won't even talk to me. There's gotta be some way to reach her. God, I just wish she was normal. Yeah, I'm sure. No. All right, all right, bye. (Frank groaning) (gentle piano music) (muffled beat music) (muffled people chattering) (Chelsea sighing) (people laughing) (camera snapping) - Where have you been? - Around. - We've missed you. - Yeah, well. - Rob's looking for you. Oh, I got a gift for you. - What is it? - A bunch of old Polaroids. - Of what? - Of you and Rob. - Oh, don't worry about it, you don't have to-- - No, it's totally cool, I'll just go get them. - You can give it to me later. - No, they're awesome. Let me go get them-- - No, really, it's fine. - [Guy] Shannon! - Wait, one second, I'll be right back. (muffled beat music) - Boo! You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Where have you been? Hello? - Sick. - Yeah. Kinda been asking about you. - You could've texted. - I wanted to but I heard you were, you know, going through something, so, I just figured I'd, you know, give you some space. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, Shannon actually wanted me to give you these. (Rob chuckling) I'm so sorry for almost dropping you there. You know, I'm afraid of spiders and that was a pretty big one on my shoe. And that one is my favorite. Now, whatever you're going through, I'll be here. - Right here? - Yes, right here. In this house, which I actually don't even know whose house this is but it's mine now. (Chelsea laughing) So I don't really care what anybody says. Yeah. (Rob sighing) I miss this. - Miss what? - This. You know, just having fun, hanging out, seeing you. Your smile. Just, I really miss you. (electric fizzling) - Rob? (eerie music) (creatures snarling) (Chelsea screaming) (electrical fizzling) Stop! (dramatic music) - You okay? What happened? (somber music) (papers rustling) (dramatic piano music) (ominous music) (eerie whispering) (ominous music) (creature clicking) (creature hissing) (electrical fizzling) (foreboding music) (metal clattering) (eerie music) - Dad? (object scraping) (creature clicking) (creature snarling) (electrical fizzling) (eerie music) (atmosphere whooshing) (Chelsea gasping) (faint video game music) - What're you doing up? Don't you have a television in your bedroom? - No. Mom won't let me. - That's what your mother chooses to end on in her parenting? Why are you awake? Hey. - [Chelsea] I can't sleep. - [Frank] Are you gonna be awake enough for your appointment tomorrow? - [Chelsea] Yeah. - Well, let me get in on this. How do I join? (Chelsea chuckling) Come on, I'll kick your ass. - Oh no you won't. This is accelerate. - Got it. - Move right and left. - I think I got it. - Okay. - I warn you, I've been trained in police chasing. - [Chelsea] Move over. - At least you didn't say, move over, old man. (Chelsea chuckling) This is actually fun. - Yeah. - Oh, what is that? What am I? Am I a fox? - Um, actually, that would be a bandicoot. Why are you sleeping on the couch? - Because. - That wasn't really an answer. - I don't know. It doesn't feel right making myself comfortable. You know, coming home, here, used to be the highlight of my day. You'd be running all over the house and I would find you by following the sound of your laughter. You were... I guess everything changes. Maybe it was your mother and I drifting apart or you growing up. Maybe... Maybe I changed. I don't know what's really going on with you. I think it's something you're gonna have to work out on your own. But... Just don't lose yourself. Who you are. It's important, believe me. Just stay where I can see you, you know? (faint television chattering) (ominous music) Chelsea! Chelsea, we gotta go! Chelsea! Chelsea. Chelsea! Chelsea! Chelsea! Chelsea, we've gotta go! - What? - You have an appointment at two o'clock, let's go. - What, what are you? (lawnmower buzzing) - What're you doing out here? - I don't know. - Come on, we gotta go. We gotta go, come on, let's go. Your mother would kill me if we miss this appointment. We're here. - Yep. (traffic whooshing) - Looks expensive. I'm glad you're going. What do you talk about in there? Oh, right, I shouldn't ask. Are you staying off that glutton stuff? People are doing that now, right? Do you think these sessions are helping? - I don't hurt myself. - Look, I know it to be rough. Hold on. You know what, I've got a good idea. (engine rumbling) (gentle piano music) Let's go, it's gonna start. - [Chelsea] Do we have to? - [Frank] Trust me, it'll be really good today. - [Chelsea] I don't wanna be here right now. - [Frank] Come on. - [Chelsea] Dad, can we please just go home? - [Frank] Come on, come on. (pleasant music) - I don't get it. - What's not to get? - I feel like that movie used to be so different. - Yeah, when you're a little kid, movies seem a lot better. You're more sophisticated now. - I guess. I just don't see why she had to choose either one of them. - Well she was in love with two people. You can't date two people. - She could've chosen to be single. That would've given her more time to focus on defeating the council. - [Frank] That would not have been much of a movie. - Well then, she could've dated both of them. - Okay, I am not having that conversation with you. I am not talking about that. - Oh, crap. - What? Hey. (ominous music) That's bleeding. - [Chelsea] It's nothing. - That could get infected. - Dad, it's not gonna get infected. Don't worry about it. - No. - It's fine. - I've never seen anything like this. (ominous music) Does it hurt? - No. - We have to keep our eyes on this. You know, I worry about you. - I know. - Your mother and I just want you to get better. - You guys don't exactly get along. - Yeah. But when it comes to you, we're in complete agreement. When you were a little kid, do you remember how often you used to fall down and skin your knee? Your mother would run and get the first aid kit, it was my job to clean you up. We were a good team. - When you two weren't fighting. - No, I mean the three of us. You know the best part of my job? You never cried. You were so strong. You would bounce right back up and go out and play. You were taking on the world. Lately though-- - I'm doing all right. - You've become distant. - I'm trying my best. You haven't been around. It's just stuff going on. - Well, it's no reason to act out. You know, you'd make a pretty good profiler. I'm serious. You have a great attention to detail. I've seen your drawings. That kind of stuff makes you focus. Keeps you busy, you don't have time to-- - What? - [Frank] You know, I see a lot of cases at the precinct-- - I can finish it. - No, I can do it. - No! I got it. (Frank sighing) (door knocking) - Chels? Are you okay? So this probably seems like odd timing but I got you a gift a couple weeks ago. I was gonna give it to you earlier today but I'm gonna give it to you now. (gentle piano music) It's an iPod. It actually came with some music on it. Believe it or not, I listened to it myself. I kinda liked it. It was... It was kinda jumpy. My dad would've hated it. Um... Well, I hope you like it. Um... Look, I'm sorry. I'm trying. (dramatic piano music) - [Miller] You didn't even see the rest of the house. (dramatic piano music) (engine rumbling) (ominous music) - Police, coming down. (metal clanking) (Frank gasping) Mr. Taylor? (blood squelching) I'm gonna get you some help. (eerie music) (dial tone buzzing) This is officer Frank Sanders. I need an ambulance at 2460 Chicago Avenue. - [Man] Cause of dispatch? - Knife wound to the neck. Possible attempted suicide. - [Man] 115 priority one, to 59 bravo 141. (muffled man speaking on phone) (creature squealing) (Frank groaning) (electrical fizzling) (child laughing) (birds chirping) (somber music) - Sir! Frank. What's going on? - I'm not sure. - Sir, are you okay? - I don't know. - [Miller] Do you want am EMT to check you out? - That thing. - [Miller] What thing? - In the house. - Mr. Taylor? We're getting them help. - No. - It's covered. - [Frank] On the floor. - What are you talking about? (eerie music) Frank, stay with me, what did you see? - I have to get back. - Where? Where are you going? Frank! - Gotta go home! Come on, sweetheart. Answer the phone. Chelsea! Chelsea! (Frank huffing) (girls faintly speaking) (gentle piano music) - Fell on Shannon's feet. - Oh! - Yeah. Oh God, she ended up having to pass it off as like an impressionist imitation. - [Anne] Oh my God, she would. - Rob totally covered for me though. - He would. (Chelsea sighing) What's it like living with your dad again? Is he mean? - No. He... He just gave me this gift. It's... So, he thought it was an iPod but it's, I don't even know what it is, it's just not an iPod. - Like an off brand? - Like, like a Zune or something. (Anne laughing) - Chelsea, take it back. (Anne laughing) Everyone's been asking about you at school. They just wanna know where you are. (gentle piano music) So what's been going on? I know it's not Rob. I'm sorry, you don't have to tell me. - No, I want to. - Chelsea, we all have demons. - You don't. - I'm no saint. You know that better than anyone. - You're right. - Stuff happens to everyone. You know, depression comes out of this fear. There's gotta be a way to sift through all the hate and anger and... Isolation. Sometimes we need each other to get through. Maybe. Paint all over it. (Chelsea laughing) Maybe don't fall into it but... Paint. (Anne and Chelsea laughing) I don't know. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Who was that? - That was Anne. - I was worried about you, are you okay? - Yeah. - Hold on, I need to see something. - What? - Let me look at your neck. - No! (phone buzzing) No. - You need to trust me. - Stop it! - I'm trying to take care of you. - [Chelsea] What is your problem? - Just let me look at this! - Fuck off! (phone buzzing) - [Miller] Hi Frank, it's Officer Miller. I just got back from the hospital. Mr. Taylor is suffering from a lot of trauma. Doctors can't seem to get him to talk even though he's completely conscious. But the thing is, he's showing signs of sexual assault which we didn't know before. So please call me back when you can and, oh yes, and they did find the object on the floor that you mentioned. I'll have more information on that from the lab tomorrow. Call me back when you can. Thank you, bye. (crickets chirping) (somber music) (Frank snoring) (door creaking) (gun cranking) (birds chirping) (phone dial clicking) (dial tone buzzing) - Hello. My name's Frank Sanders. My daughter, Chelsea, is patient of Dr. Reardon's. I was wondering if I could speak with Dr. Reardon. No, I don't know if I'm on the HIPPA form. I'm her father, does that help? Could I make an appointment for myself? - [Woman] But it would be as a new patient, is that okay? - Sure, a new patient evaluation would be fine. - [Woman] So, let me see. I have an opening at 4:45. - Today? - [Woman] Would you like to schedule an appointment? - Yeah, that would be good. Okay. All right. Thank you. (gentle piano music) (car door thudding) (car engine rumbling) I don't know what to believe. I'm really at a loss. I'm a police officer. We believe in evidence and facts. Science. I mean, how can something exist if no one can see it? I have seen some very strange things. This is so far out of normal experience. Chelsea's not the only one. I hear stories like this from... crazy people. (dramatic piano music) I believe she believes it. But I feel like I owe it to her to believe it too. But it's my duty as a cop to find the truth. - [Doctor] What about your duty as a father? - Chelsea? You hungry? Chels. - [Chelsea] No. - Me neither. What comes at night? (door clicking) - You won't believe me. - What do they look like? - Tall. Big eyes. - And that's what you're afraid of. Okay. I'll be here. I'll stay up. (door creaking) (Chelsea screaming) It's okay. (Chelsea crying) Chelsea. Just me, Chelsea. - [Chelsea] Don't let them touch me. - There's no one here. (Chelsea crying) No one's here. I'm here. (Chelsea crying) It's gonna be okay. Oh, Chelsea. (Chelsea sobbing) It's almost three o'clock. - I know. They'll come. You don't believe me. - [Frank] I didn't say anything. - You don't have to. - [Frank] I'm here. - No you're not. What's this? - [Frank] See for yourself. - So you do believe me. - Honestly, I don't know what I believe. - Where did you get this? - It's from an open case I'm working on. - So you know. - I don't know what I know. - You've seen what they can do. - No. - Why won't you believe me? - I'm trying. - Try harder. Is this why you left? - When? - Before, when you ran out of the house. - [Frank] I didn't know you were up. - What did you find? - Nothing. - Tell me. - I found a sick man. - What did they do to him? - We took him to the hospital, we got him help. - No! What did they do to him? - He hurt himself. - How do you know that? - I was the one who found him. He mutilated himself. He needed help and I got him help. - You can't help him. I didn't do this to myself. Dad, I'm not crazy, okay? - Chelsea, we can get you help. - I'm not crazy. I don't need that kind of help! - Please. - Stop it, Dad, stop it! - You can't keep doing this to yourself. - Stop it! - Just make it through tonight-- - Shut up! - And we'll get you some help tomorrow. - Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! - Please. - I'm scared! You don't know what it's like. I was happy, I had friends, I was normal and now all I can think about is waking up in that place, feeling their hands holding me down. Screaming. But knowing there's no one there to help me. It's like I'm not me anymore and I just want it to stop. And you sit here and you tell me that you're gonna help me, you're gonna, you're gonna help, you're gonna get me help? That's not enough. I need you to believe me. Then I'll prove it. (ominous tempo music) - Chelsea! Chelsea! (door thudding) Don't do anything stupid! (door thudding) Chelsea, open the door! I believe you! Chelsea! Chelsea! (door thudding) (ominous music) Chelsea! Chelsea! (eerie music) Don't do anything stupid! (Chelsea groaning) (Chelsea whimpering) I believe you, Chelsea, come out! Open the door! (door thudding) Goddamn it! Open the door! - No! No! - Chelsea! Chelsea, I love you, open the door! Open the door. What did you do? - I got it. I got it. - You're going to the hospital. - No! No! - My job is to keep you safe! - It's over! I'm okay. - This is not okay! - I found proof. - Where? - I lost it. - You are going to the hospital. - No, I'm not going back there! - Don't you understand? No one is coming for you, you need medication! This is all a figment of your imagination! - Fuck you! (atmosphere rumbling) Dad? Dad? Don't look in their eyes. Come on! (atmosphere rumbling) Dad! (ominous music) - What the fuck was that? What do we do? - What do we do? What do we do, Dad? What do we do? I don't know what to do. Dad, what do we do? - Focus, we need to focus. - We can set off the alarm. - That is not a bad idea. I'm gonna open the door and swing as hard as I can. You ready? - Yeah. - Okay, I'll be right back. - [Chelsea] Okay. - I'll be right here, I promise. - I'm not scared. - I know. I know. (dramatic piano music) (creature buzzing) (faint whispering) - What do you want? (electronic beeping) What do you want from me? (faint whispering) Leave me alone! (dramatic piano music) You can't have me. You can't have me! (faint whispering) (atmosphere rumbling) (eerie music) (creature growling) - [Frank] Stand back! (door thudding) (electronic fizzling) (creature rattling) (dramatic music) (gunshot booming) (creature hissing) (gunshot booming) (creature hissing) (dramatic music) (creature hissing) - Dad! (pleasant music) - [Frank] Chelsea. - [Girl] Daddy! - Dad, stop! Dad! Dad, stop, you have to fight it! Dad, wake up! (dramatic music) (atmosphere rumbling) Dad, I'm right here. Daddy, I'm right here! (Chelsea crying) It's gonna be okay. - I'll never leave you again. - I'm right here. I'm right here.
