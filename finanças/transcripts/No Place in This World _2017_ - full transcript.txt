- Lucas, you shot and killed three students, and wounded eight others in your class. What do you have to say about that? - They deserved it. Hey, Tyler. - Hey has a gun. - Jesus, no. - Parents send their kids to school trusting that they will be safe, but in one of those schools, a high school in Palm Beach county, today, the worst happened. Police say a student opened fire on classmates, leaving four dead, and 11 others injured. Two of them are in critical condition. The alleged shooter is a teenage boy, who is said to be in custody tonight. We have late word from our law enforcement sources that the young shooter told police he was bullied and teased in school and that the shooting was in retaliation to that. What about the families of the children that you murdered? You don't have any remorse for them? - What about me? They raised those monsters everyday who tormented me. Laughed at me, made fun of me. - In Washington, an 11 year old boy appeared in court today, charged with bringing two knives, a gun, and 400 rounds of ammunition to school. - Good evening. I'm sitting in the home of Brenley Tompkins. Many of you may remember her from the incident at Twin Lakes Middle School. - New details are beginning to emerge as we learn more about the Kennedy Cross Middle School shooting that left four kids dead, seven wounded, and of those, two are in critical condition. - I feel scared and uncomfortable. I just don't feel safe here anymore. - We were all running for our lives. I could hear kids screaming behind me, as the shots were being fired, so I just ran into one of the rooms, hid under the desk and prayed. - It was a day like any other day at Crystal Creek High School. Classes were beginning to start, and children were clearing the halls as the sound of the school bell rang. - This incident comes after a week of gun violence at schools across the country, as the city of Melrose Park mourns the loss of 11 students who attended Philmore Middle School. - Everybody wants to know why. That's the real question. The answer is we don't know right now. - I told them that I was gonna do this if they didn't stop. Do you want someone to blame? Blame them. Don't give me this crap about remorse. I'd do it again because they had what was coming to them. God, what are we becoming? What is happening to the world today? It's senseless. It's so senseless. Can you please send the police out here? There's a kid with a gun in school. Two units to clear for a 911 in progress. - We're gonna be late for school, gonna get going. Do you have all your school books? - I think so. - I think so is not the answer I wanna hear, Lauren. - Yes, I have all my school books. - I got you an apple, and here, take this. - But this is your birthday money from Aunt Clair? - Okay, Lauren, you have to eat something. Okay, Addie. - Hey, Addie, get your Mom up. She can't be late for work again. - Should get going else you're gonna miss the school bus. - All right, Addie. - Have a good day in school. - You, too. Mom, it's time to get up. Did you hear me? It's time to get up. - Great. What time is it? It's going on 7:30. You're gonna be late if you don't get going. Okay, just a minute. - You need to go grocery shopping. There's nothing to eat in this house. - Addison, don't start with me this morning. I already told you, your daddy hasn't gotten paid yet. - How is it that he can afford to bring home a case of beer and cigarettes every single night, yet he can't afford to bring home food? Does that make any sense to you? - How dare you disrespect your daddy like that? I mean, who do you think you are? You don't know the first clue about raising kids, Addison. Look, your daddy works every day... - Stop calling him my daddy. - You listen here, young lady. I will not allow you to disrespect your father in this house. - Wayne isn't our father. Okay, our father died four years ago. If Wayne gave a crap about us, he would make sure that we have food on the table every day, instead, Lauren and I go to school hungry every morning. Do you even care anymore, Mom? I mean, ever since you hooked up with Wayne, everything has changed. You have changed so much since Dad died. Do you even know what's going on with us anymore? Do you even know that Lauren is getting picked on every day by kids in her school? - Addie, they're just kids playing around. That's what you think this is? - We all did that when we were young. Lauren needs to lighten up and play along. - Kids playing around. They are hurting her emotionally. They are completely demoralizing her in front of everyone. - Addison, what? - Why don't you just act like our mother for once? - How dare you? - Middle Fair isn't working for us. We wanna go back with Aunt Clair. - No, we've been over this before. My sister will not be raising my kids. We are gonna be a family again. - A family, do you even hear yourself? We can never be a family if you would wait, all you do is just drink and then pass out on the couch every night. We should have never left Aunt Clair's house. Addison, that's enough. - Whatever, I can't... - Addison. I am still your mother and you have, you don't have the right to talk to me that way. Addison, I'm still your mother whether you like it or not. Don't come back here until you're ready to apologize. I mean it. I don't have to put up with this crap from you. - Yeah, it's the new issue. My mom got it for me yesterday. My gosh, I wouldn't be caught dead wearing something like that. Who would even buy that outfit? - I don't know. Look at this one, where would you even wear something like that? - I know, right? I mean, it's just ridiculous. - Look who's coming. Well, well, well. If it isn't Lauren the loser. - Wasn't she wearing those same clothes yesterday? - Yeah. I think you're right. She was. What's wrong, Lauren? Are you too good to say hello to us? - I don't want any trouble, Casey. - Why would there be any trouble, Lauren? - Yeah, Lauren, are you looking for trouble? - It would appear that you wore the same clothes yesterday. - Are you some kind of slob or something? - Ooh, Amber, that's a little harsh. Girls, you're gonna make her cry again. Poor, Lauren, it's really not your fault, is it? She can't help it. Can you, Lauren? White trash will always be just that. White trash. - Do us all a favor and clean yourself up, Lauren. You're making me sick. - Yeah. This place stinks. - The bus is coming. - Pathetic. What are you looking at? - Good morning, Madeline. - Good morning, Janet. - This is the folder that Principal Reeves needs for his board meeting. - All right, I'll make sure that he gets it. - Great, thank you, and also, I'm expecting an appoint with Mr. Perkins today. - Okay, absolutely, and I'll let you know when he arrives. - Great, thank you. - You're welcome. - Good morning, Ms. Clark. I'm Principal Reeves. - Please, call me Christina. - Christina, nice to meet you. How may I help you today? - With this seemingly epidemic rise of bullying in our schools across the nation, I would like to run a news story on how your school is dealing with the situation. - Well, Christina, people must stop defending bullying behavior as a part of growing up with the attitude kids will be kids. Parents have to start taking more responsibility for their children's behavior. - This is the kind of approach I'm looking to run my news story with. I wanna focus on how this school, in particular, has taken a strong stance against bullying. What are some of the core elements that you've implemented here to make this a success in the fight against that kind of behavior? - It all starts with a positive school climate, easily understood rules of conduct, smaller classroom sizes, and a fair discipline practice, among all the students. I expect my faculty to be visible, vigilant, common areas such as hallways, cafeterias, locker rooms, and playgrounds. The children can trust that we will help them if they are being bullied. - Good morning, Ms. Carson. - Good morning, Lauren, how wonderful to see you today. Go ahead and take your seat. Class is gonna start soon, okay? Okay. - Good morning, Ms. Carson. Such a good student. What are you looking at, Bexley? - Good morning, boys. - Hi, Ms. Carson. - Good morning, Ms. Carson. - Signed up for this... - Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning, Ms. Carson. - Good morning. - Good morning, Ms. Carson. - Good morning. Amber, you know the rules, no cell phones in class. - Yes, Ms. Carson. - Amber, put it away or I'll take it away. - Sorry, Ms. Carson. Hey, Lauren. - Wow, she really is ugly. - Pathetic. Okay, class, let's settle down. Let's get started. - Did you run your facts on what the numbers are for school violence that's been related to bullying? - Not nationally, only for the schools of this county. - It's a staggering number. Bullying is the most common form of violence in our society, between 15 and 30% of students are either bullies or victims. The pattern of bullying can begin as early as age two, children that are spanked too harshly or too often learn that physical aggression is okay. Consistent alternatives such as the removal of privileges or additional chores, serves as a much more effective consequence to inappropriate behavior, but there are a lot of other factors to take into consideration. - What are some of those other factors you're referring to? - Those other factors have to do with political correctness in our society and how it's slowly affecting our nation. Unfortunately, I will not be able to express my opinion on that without losing my job. These are some nationwide statistics, 3.7 million youths engage in more than 3.2 million, are victims of moderate to serious bullying each year in the school system. Virtually every school shooting bullying has played a significant factor, the level of severity of bullying is directly related to the amount of adult supervision, that children receive. - I think what is so inspiring about this school is what you've implemented here, not only for the children, but your faculty and staff as well. - School should be a safe place for children to learn and play, however, I'd be naive to think that some sort of bullying isn't happening in the school right now. A few weeks ago, I was cleaning out my desk, and I came across this letter. It was written by one of our students here at the school, the author of the letter is unknown. I've shared the letter with all the staff and faculty in the hopes that we can identify the student and offer our help and assistance. This what bothers me the most. We can't be everywhere to prevent it. Go, pick it up, pick it up, let's go, let's go, finish strong, let's go. - Hey, Lauren. Hi, Timothy. - What you working on? - Nothing. Nothing really that important. - Well, I want to thank you for helping me out in Mr. Sprig's class this morning. Science isn't really my favorite subject. - It's fine, it's really no big deal. - Yeah, it was. You helped me from failing another pop quiz. So... Do you have a partner for the science project yet? - What? - The science project for Mr. Sprig's class. Do you have a partner yet? - No, Timothy, is this some sort of joke? Please just stop. - No, Lauren. I really wanna work on the science project with you. - You wanna work with me? On the science project? - Yeah, it'll be fun. I have no idea what we'll do but it'll be fun to work with you on it. My gosh, we could actually do several different projects. - That is definitely Timothy. Why would he be talking to her? Lauren's testing you, Casey. She knows you like Timothy, and she's sitting there talking to him right in front of us. - We'll see about that. - Let's go girls, you got two laps to go. We're not socializing, we're jogging out here. Get a move on. - Then the potential energy is released into kinetic energy, which causes the colored sticks to fly into the air. - That's so cool. - Yeah, it is, you should see it. Addie, Addie, something amazing happened at school today. Yeah, what happened? - Our science teacher, Mr. Sprig, gave us a science project, and we have to work on it with another classmate, and Timothy Dutsin asked me to be his partner on it. - That's great, Lauren. - And he's letting me what we're going to do. I have so many ideas in my head. We need to do something amazing. - Well, I'm sure you'll figure it out. - Do you think I can ask Mom for $10? I wanna make something really cool. - I don't know, Lauren. Everything's kind of tight right now. But you can ask her and see what she says. - Okay. - Speaking of Mom, she's gonna bring home some chicken strips. Why don't you put your backpack away? We'll be eating soon. - All right. - And Lauren. - Yeah? - I'm really happy for you about the science project. - Thanks, Addie. - So I'm getting ready to pull out the drive way, she comes running out the house screaming about why is the grout line so big. What are you talking about? It's a quarter inch grout line. She said you wanted a quarter inch. Like, well, that's not what I meant. I'm like, I don't know what you meant, I know what you said. Now how is it my fault, she has no idea what a quarter inch is? - Of course not. Of course it's not your fault. - Whatever, that's a new job if she wants it done. Not my fault. So right. - So Mom. - How's the chicken? - Mom. Mom. - Little dry. - Mom. Lauren came home with some good news today. Didn't you, Lauren? - I did. - What is it? - Mom. - What? Well, spit it out, what's the good news? - We have to do a science project for class, and Timothy Denson asked me to be his partner. - That's the good news? - That is good news, Mom. It's great news. Now Lauren gets to do something she likes, and she has a partner to do it with. - I have several ideas on the project but, I was just wondering if you could help me with it. - Help you with it? I don't know the first thing about science or school stuff for that matter. - Mom, she needs money for the project, not your help. - I see. I thought you needed my help to do the project. Great. - Imagine that. That'd be some project. Well, it certainly would. - You know, what, let's all work on the project, we'll make it a family fun night. - That's a good one. That'd be really funny. Gosh. Well, how much do you need? - I think I can get the whole project done for around $10. - $10? That's a lot of money. How'd you think we were gonna get it. - Come on, it's ridiculous. When's it gonna end with these damn schools? Last month, you needed $25. - That was for a field trip that her whole class went on. This is part of her project that counts for her final grade. There's a difference. I don't care what it was for, and I'm sorry, was I talking to you? - I swear. - You didn't get it last time. You're not gonna get it this time. You go to school to learn, not to ride around play all day. Lauren, you have to understand, we just don't have the money for these things right now. - Why? Why are you just so mean? Can I please be excused? - Absolutely. And don't come begging us for money for any of these ridiculous projects again. - Lauren. - No, let her go. - These damn schools. - Honey... - They are always trying to get money out of us for something, you know, and I am sick and tired of it. I pay my taxes. - I know. It really is ridiculous. I think the chicken's pretty good. - Whatever. What? - It's ridiculous, seriously. - Pass me her chicken. She's not gonna eat it. - Sure, hon. Eat up. - Don't let it go to waste. You had a hard day. - Hey, kiddo. Thought you could use a little company. - I hate it here. I hate my school. I just, I hate living with Mom and Wayne. I just, I can't find my place here, Addie. I feel like I don't belong here. - I know. Moving back in with mom hasn't been easy on either of us. - I just wanna move back with Aunt Clair. She actually cared about us. - You know we can't do that. Mom won't let us. It's not like Aunt Clair hasn't tried. - I mean, why can't Mom just understand for once? - I don't know. I don't think we'll ever really understand Mom. - It's like she doesn't even care anymore. - I don't think Mom really ever got over losing Dad. She's here but she doesn't really hear anymore. - Yeah. - But that doesn't matter. We have each other. I have something for you. - What is it? - Open it up. - Where did you get all these Addie? - Every time Wayne and Mom come home and leave change lying around, I pick it up and put it away. They don't even know that it's missing. - Wow, how much is in here? - Last time I checked, over $18. I was gonna give it to you last month for your field trip but it wasn't enough money. - This is awesome. And brilliant. But I can't take the money that you've been saving. - You can and you will. It's for your science project. - I don't know what to say, Addie. - Say nothing, Lauren. You're gonna create an amazing science project, I just know it. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome, Lauren. I love you. - I love you too. - Ms. Carson, many children in today's society come to school dealing with stressful, sometimes traumatic issues, whether it be from home or societal pressure, and it undoubtedly affects their performance at school. What have you done to understand that, and to address each students individual needs? - I think it's important to really get to know the students in my class, children who deal with traumatic issues, their minds just aren't on school work, and unfortunately, the conventional methods of dealing with them are often not applicable. As educators, we need to address the emotional, the social, the physical and the intellectual parts of children. - It would appear that teachers have had to adapt to being not only teachers, but also counselors to the children in their classrooms. - It was never our intent to turn teachers into counselors or into social workers, but we did have to create a climate and a culture here in the school that benefited the children's ability to learn. The safety of our children is everybody's responsibility. These children are our legacy and they need to be taken care of and understood. - My gosh, there she is. - It is her, it's Lauren the loser. - Quick, somebody call security. Tell 'em to remove this trash from school. You should watch where you're going, Bexley. Serves her right. - Just leave them, I can do it myself. - It's fine, Bexley. I don't mind helping you. - Just leave them. What are you, stupid or something? Just leave me alone. You're only gonna make things worse. - Dude, I just didn't expect the whole thing just blow up like that. - But that was the best part. Yeah, now I have to wait until next season to find out who's even in the helicopter. - Yeah. But I had a feeling it was Captain Smithmore and Hunter. - Well, I know one thing for sure, I hate cliffhangers. - Yeah. - Hey, Timothy. - Hey, Casey. Hey, Lauren. - Hi, Timothy. - So what time do you want to start working on the science project tomorrow? - Well, I guess it would have to be sometime in the afternoon. My sister and I, we're going to the craft store in the morning to get what we need. - Would it be okay if I went with you and your sister? - You wanna go with us? I mean, that would be great. I'm just still not sure what project to do yet. We could go over them and you could help me choose you. - I want you to pick the one that you wanna do. I'm sure whatever you decide will be perfect. - What does he see in her? and my mom gave me $5 to pitch in for supplies. - That's great. - So what time are you guys heading to the craft store? - I would say around 10. - Awesome, I'll be at your house at 10. - Mr. Denson, did you forget where your assigned seat is? - No, Ms. Carson. - Okay, class, we're gonna pick up where we left off with yesterday's discussion on the revolutionary war. Turn to page 42 in your textbook. - Text you later. Make sure you find out if Noah has anymore... - Casey, is there something you'd like to share with the class? - No, Ms. Carson. - Then I suggest that you remain quiet and pay attention to today's lesson. - Okay, Timothy, what's going on? - Whoa, Casey. What do you mean? - Don't play dumb with me, Timothy. Lauren, that stupid, ugly girl. - Casey. What about her? - You two are doing the science project together? - What is your infatuation with her? - What? Lauren's actually a cool girl. - A cool girl? Wow, Timothy, that's really lame, even for you. - Whatever, Casey. - Timothy, you have to get going. Ms. Roberts is waiting in the car for us. - I still have to get my skateboard from Ms. Claremont's. Come on, Timothy. We don't have time for this. - Really? You're just gonna walk away from me like that? - I'm sorry, Casey, I can't deal with this right now. - You guys sure didn't make an easy science project. - Don't blame me. It's Lauren's fault. - What? It's not my fault. It's easy. It just takes time. Well, I best, I bet I get going. - Okay. - I'll be at your house after I finish helping my mom clean out the garage. - All right. - So that'll be like a few hours. - All right. - Bye, Timothy. - Bye, girls. - Bye. - He seems like a nice boy. - Yeah. But he's my only friend that I have at my new school. - I'm sure you'll make more. Starting a new school's always hard. - Yeah. The cupcake shop is open. - Can we get a cupcake, Addie? - I don't know. - Please. We haven't done it in so long. - Sure, why not? - Thank you. - Hey, there, welcome to Nicole's House of Cakes. How can I help you girls? - Hi. Whoa, these cupcakes look amazing. - Do you know which one you're gonna get? - I don't know. They all look so good. They even have your favorite one here, Addie, red velvet. Well, I'll go with the chocolate vanilla one. - One chocolate vanilla coming up. - Are you getting one, Addie? - I don't know yet. - Here you go, sweetie. - Thank you. You're welcome. - How 'bout you go take a seat? I'll be right there. - All right. - How much are the cupcakes? - They're 4.75 each. - Okay. That's... That's $2. 4.75. - Okay, and what can I get you, sweetie? - I'm not gonna be getting one today. Thank you. - Where's your cupcake, Addie? - Here it is, one red velvet cupcake, just for you. I hope you enjoy it, honey, and if you need anything else, just let me know, okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I knew you were gonna get that one. - It sure is my favorite. It tastes good. - I'm sure it does. Do you remember when we did this with Dad when he was alive? - Yeah, he was one to always make time for us. - Yeah. - Hey, do you remember that one time that Aunt Marie and Uncle Bob came down for Aunt Linda's wedding? Yeah, that's right. - And how Aunt Marie had to go to the fast food place before the wedding so she could have her... Milkshake. - Yeah. - And then Uncle Bob got a chocolate one, and he spills it on her seat, and then she sat in it. - And then Dad said that she pooped her pants again. That was funny. - Those were good times. - How's your cupcake. Good, how's yours? It's amazing. - The trick is to line up a bunch of them to make one clean cut. - Like this? - Yeah, that's perfect. - Thanks. - I think I shall let you girls do the road cutting. - Well, it's definitely different. - You should probably use the ruler so it's a little bit more straight. - But not a road. - Yeah. If you squint it kind of does, but... - Addie, Aunt Clair's here. Aunt Clair. My gosh, I missed you girls so much. - I've missed you, too. - Hey, Addie. - Hi, Aunt Clair, did you get our messages? - Yes, I did, that's actually one of the reasons why I'm here. - When will we be able to spend a weekend with you? We hardly see you anymore. - That's something I'm trying to work on, sweetie. Hopefully soon. - Right, okay. - You should probably go help Timothy with the roads. - Okay. - Go help your friend. - All right. - Addie, what's really going on here? - It's Mom. She's living in this delusional world where we're all gonna be a happy family again, yet, every night she comes home and drinks and smokes until she passes out on the couch with Wayne. She's completely neglecting our needs. I don't care about me, but it's Lauren that I'm worried about. She's having such a hard time adjusting and the kids at school are being so mean. I don't know what to do. It's having a really big effect on her. - Has your mother talked to anyone about this? - No, she doesn't care. Gosh. I don't know what's wrong with her, Addie. I'll go to Lauren's school sometime this week and talk to the principal. - No, no, if Mom finds out you're involved, she'll only make things worse. I'll figure it out. - I'm so sorry you girls are having to go through all this. I love you so much. - You out here trying to brainwash my kids again, Clair? - Why don't you let your mother and I talk for a few minutes, okay, sweetheart? - Yeah, Addie, let us grown up discuss how I'm not gonna let my sister take my kids away from me. Mom, don't fight with her. - Fine, Addie. I won't fight with my sister. So, what is it now, Clair? What do you want? - Julie, why do we have to fight over this? We both want what's best for Addie and Lauren. I just wanna spend more time with them. Why can we be civil and work out on our own? - Be civil. You did not just say that to me. You're the one trying to steal my kids and turn them against me, and you wanna talk about being civil. Grief. You know, you always thought that you were so much better than me with your high paying jobs and fancy clothes and nice cars, you can buy whatever you want, Clair, but you cannot buy my kids. - Julie, it's never been about any of that. It's about what's best for the kids right now. Why can't you understand that? I'm not trying to hurt you, I'm trying to help you. I understand all too well. - Once we get all the roads cut, we can finally glue them down. - Mom will never let us go back. - What? - I said Mom will never let us go back with Aunt Clair. We're stuck here, Addie. - You don't know that, Lauren. They just have to get past their anger and find some common ground. - All I know is that we're the ones being punished for Mom being mad at Aunt Clair. - I know all too well about your health. Get off my property before I call the cops. You okay, Aunt Clair? - I'm fine. Addie. I just, I want you to take this. - What for? - Anything you need it for. I want you to have it in case of an emergency, okay? Just put it somewhere safe so your mom and Wayne don't take it from you. Okay. - Addie, you have to promise me you'll keep me better informed about what's going on around here? - I just don't want you to worry. - I always worry about you and Lauren. Promise me, you'll call me on a regular basis? Promise. - I love you so much, Addie. I love you, too. - Are you leaving already, Aunt Clair? - Yes, sweetie, I have to go now. I know this is hard, but we have to be strong for each other, okay. - Okay. - It's gonna be okay. I promise. I love you girls so much. I love you, too, Aunt Clair. - I know. - And the road is complete. - That's good. - You're gonna have to be really careful bringing this to school. - I know, I will. I can't wait to see what everybody else in class has done. - You and Timothy did a great job on this, Lauren. I'm really proud of you. - Thank you, Addie, for helping us. - Of course. You should probably get the rest of your stuff ready so you're not running late. I'm gonna go make your lunch. - All right, I'm ready to go. I think I'm gonna see if Aunt Clair emailed me back. I sent her a picture of the science project. - Yeah, I'm sure she's gonna love it. - I hope so. What a complete loser. I don't even know how you can look at yourself in the mirror every morning. If I looked like that, I would just kill myself. You're not wanted here. You should just go back to your old school. You make me sick, Lauren. Hopefully she'll just kill herself so we don't have to waste a good bucket of water. - Lauren, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Lauren, hold up a second, you forgot your lunch. You okay? - I'm fine. - You don't look fine. - I'll be fine. - Do you wanna talk about it? - I'm fine. - I'm here. - Fine. - Did something happen? I'm gonna be late for school if I don't get going. - I love you. - I love you, too, Addie. - Have a good day at school. Okay. - What a complete loser. I don't even know how you could look at yourself in the mirror every morning. Hopefully she'll just kill herself. You make me sick, Lauren. - Amber, look, it's Lauren, and she has her science project. Lauren, hold up. - What do you have there, Lauren? - If I'm not mistaken, I think it's her science project. Come on, we just wanna see what you... - Stop pulling on it. You're going to break it. - Fine, that's why you don't have any friends, Lauren. You don't know how to be nice to people. - Do you want me to hold that for you? It looks extremely fragile. I wouldn't want you to trip or anything. - Wow, you really are pathetic, Lauren. - She's such a klutz. I hope she didn't break it. - Lauren, what happened? - I'm sorry. - What do you think, Timothy? She's a clumsy fool and you know what clumsy fools do? They fall. - Lauren. - Is she gonna cry? She's running home to mommy. Looks like you picked the wrong person to do your science project with. - No, Casey, I picked the right person. - Addie, look, I know you're upset but you can't just go barging in there yelling and screaming. - Victoria, this is my baby sister you're talking about. I'm the only one she has protecting her right now. - I know that, but the school administers probably don't even know this is going on, and you have to explain to them rationally or else they won't even hear you out. I think you should let me do the talking, at least at first. Just until you can cool down. - I got this, Vic. Okay, it just, some of the things they said about her, it's so mean. - Okay. Lauren. - Mom. What, why aren't you at school? - I ruined it, Mom. - Ruined what, what is ruined? - My science project. Casey and her friends ruined it. God. Why didn't you just tell your teachers what happened? - You don't understand. That would just make everything worse. That would give them something else to come after me with. - No, I understand... - It never ends. I understand exactly what's going on. - No, you don't. Please, just let me go back to my old school and live with Aunt Clair. - No, Lauren. God, I'm so sick of this. I just can't take this any more. - Please, Mom. This isn't my fault. I've tried to fit in, I've tried to avoid them. But it's just the same every day. They find a way to taunt me, make fun of me. It's humiliating. - You are allowing this to happen. - I'm not. - Lauren, yes, you are. Why can't you understand this? I'm not allowing this to happen. - Yes, you are. This is so embarrassing for me. Lauren, I can't take this anymore. I'm so sick of this childish behavior. Why can't you just be more like your older sister? She doesn't bring home this crap to me every day. She doesn't cause me all these problems. You're going to have to grow up. I'm gonna be late for work, Lauren. You're gonna have to deal with your own problems. You know, I have been stuck raising you and Addie on my own since your father died, and now I finally met someone that I can spend my time with and be happy again. And I'm not gonna let you or your sister ruin what I have with Wayne. There's gonna be some big changes around here, so you might as well get used to them. You know, you gotta lot of issues, Lauren. If you can't let a few kids play around with you at school, just stop acting like a stupid crybaby and go back to school. So sick of this. - It's having a really damaging effect on her, and I'm extremely concerned about Lauren. I just, I think it's important that no one else knows that I was here today. - What Addie is trying to say is she just wants this whole matter to be resolved. - I agree. I'd just like to get a better understanding of what happened from your sister's perspective. - Excuse me, Principal Reeves. - Yes, Ms. Clairmont, please come in. - Actually, if you don't mind, I'd like to speak with you privately. - Certainly, very sorry. Would you excuse me for a moment? - John, Lauren Wright wasn't in class today. Ms. Carson was talking about an incident that involved Lauren and some of the girls earlier. - What happened? - Ms. Carson was vague on the details. She's just finding out about this herself. John, I think this is bad. She said that a young boy came up to her about this information. - What's the young man's name? Timothy Denson. - Have Timothy come down to my office. Ms. Clairmont, do it quietly. I don't want the other students to know what's going on. - Okay. Is everything okay? - Actually, I just learned there was an incident this morning involving your sister. - What kind of incident? - Is Lauren okay? - Lauren's not on the school campus right now. We're looking into the details of what happened? - I just can't take this any more. This is so embarrassing for me. You are allowing this to happen. - I'm not, I'm not. - Yes, you are. Why can't you understand this? Why can't you just be more like your older sister? What a complete loser. I don't even know how you can look at yourself in the mirror every morning. Hopefully she'll just kill herself. You're not wanted here. - I am nothing but a loser. There is no place for me here. I just want it to stop. I'm so sorry. So sorry. - You're not in trouble, Timothy. We're just trying to find out what happened earlier today. We'll get you back to... - Timothy. What happened to Lauren? - Young lady. - Ms. Clairmont, please. I have a very bad feeling about this. What happened, Timothy? - Addie, she was so upset. I didn't see the whole thing but I heard that Casey Abrams, she already pushed Lauren in the hallway on the science project. Everything was ruined. I felt bad, Addie. When I saw the science project under Lauren, I was... - Timothy, no it's okay, Timothy. You didn't mean to hurt Lauren. I know that. - Hurt Lauren, that's the last thing I ever wanted to do. - Vic, check out back for the swing set. - Okay. - Lauren. Lauren, are you here? - Lauren, Lauren, Lauren. I was over 10 minutes late to work today because of Lauren. - Mom, I don't care if you were late. Do you know where Lauren is? I don't know. I guess she went back to school. - No, she's not at school. I just came from there, okay. You know, I'm getting really sick and tired of this. There's gonna be some big changes around here. - Nevermind. - Addie. - Did you find her? - She's not there. She must be at the bridge, come on. - This morning, we will talk about joy. Jesus wants you to have true joy. The presence of Christ from the very beginning of his birth till now was meant to bring joy. The truth is the church and the world suffer from a saddening lack of old fashioned simple hearted, overflowing Christian joy. Paul said to the church... - Lauren! Rejoice in the lord always. - Vic, she's in the water. She's in the water. She's in the water. - Can you say that with me? Rejoice in the lord always. - Lauren, no. - There's someone in the water. My god. - Look at me, look at me. You have to get out the water. Help. - It is a pity that joy is not as easy to find as trouble. Some people look for trouble, like it is a buried treasure, so glad that they have found it. The joy of Jesus Christ is real joy. It's lasting joy. It is joy that is unspeakable and full of glory. It is joy that is unshakeable because it is not fragile. - Lauren. Help! Please! - It is a joy. - Help us! That will endure the storms of life. - Help, help. It is real joy that will heal the sobbing soul and turn it into a new psalm. It is joy that heals a broken heart, and gives it new life. - Do something. - CPR, please, anything. - Do... - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, she's gone. It is a joy that turns a bitter frown into a radiant smile. - Please. - It is a joy... - Why? Turns the deepest despair into the greatest delight. - Why? - It is the joy that is found in Jesus Christ, for he alone is the source of joy. - Addie, she's not here. - No, no. - Addie, I'm so sorry. - No, no. Somebody call 911. Please. Lauren. - She's unconscious, send help, please, now, Vincent Park. - I want to tell you something. Jesus Christ is greater than any problem you may have. And Jesus is the answer for any problem you may possess. If we will cling to him, he will deliver you and give you the answer. Have you ever noticed the people searching for joy are those who most desperately need it? The joy of Jesus is within us. But it doesn't get there by itself. It comes the day you acknowledge Jesus Christ as lord. Father, in the precious name of Jesus, I ask that you speak to the hearts of those who need you more now than ever before. Help guide them to the answers that they seek. Provide them with the warmth of the holy spirit, in the name of Jesus we pray, amen. - If God is so good and holy then why would he allow my sister to suffer and die? Can you even answer that? Why would he take her from me? She was good, she didn't deserve to die. - Young lady, I am so very sorry for your loss. - That doesn't answer my question. Why would God allow my sister to suffer and die? What kind of loving God would do such a thing? - God does not cause the painful experiences in our lives. However, he allows them. I believe he does this to test our faith, to mature us and bring us into a closer relationship with him. - A relationship. Why would I want a relationship with a god who does nothing to protect those who need him the most, and leaves them suffering in pain? - Young lady, please. There are times in life when all hope seems lost. Times when no amount of religious activity, of Bible reading, prayer, self examination provides any consolation. Times when it is impossible to look at the brighter side because no brighter side seems to exist. The lord saves those who are broken hearted. When you think your faith has failed you, all your hopes and dreams are gone, listen for the angel's voice. She will come to you. Talk to Him. Talk to God. He will listen to you. God, please help that broken hearted soul. - Were there signs of any unusual behavior that you were aware of? - No, there weren't any unusual signs of behavior. She was a good girl. - This is the number we can reach you at at the house. - Yep, that's the house number. - Okay, well, I have all the information I need. We'll have someone call you in the morning. - Okay. Addie, god. Are you okay? - I'm fine. - Where have you been, I've been worried sick? - Just went for a walk. I had to clear my head. I can't believe Lauren's gone. - I know, Addie. I know. It'll be okay. - I'm gonna go inside. - Addie, are you okay? - No. No, I'm not okay. Going to lay down. - Addison. Just let her go. - I would like to open by speaking to the students of Cambridge Middle School. We're living in some hard times. Perhaps harder than they've ever been. With all the pressure you face, it may sometimes seem that life is bleak and not worth living, especially if you're having trouble at home or at school or if you feel that no one understands you. If this is how you feel, talk to someone. If that someone you choose will not or cannot listen, talk to someone else. Your parents, teachers, and friends, may think they know what's going on, but they can't really know unless you tell them. Now, I'd like to introduce Ms. Carson. - Cambridge faculty, staff, and students. I'm Ms. Carson, and Lauren Wright was my student. The death of a loved one can shake us to our very foundation, when the person is so young, so full of hope, and so full of potential, the feelings of grief and loss can be even more overwhelming. During times such as this, we turn to our friends, our family, for support, for a shoulder to cry on, and for someone to walk the road of pain and anguish with us. I'd like to share the words of a hymn written by a dying grandmother to her grandchildren, I believe these words speak of Lauren Wright and to us. As hard as I try, I just didn't fit in. I was never good enough. There is no place in this world for me. I'm so sorry, Addie. I couldn't take the pain anymore. - An hour ends as our beginning, an our time, infinity, an our doubt, there is believing, in our life, eternity. In our death, a resurrection, at the last, a victory, unrevealed until its season. Something God alone can see. - Hi, Mr. Anderson, I'm Dr. Conrad. Hi. - I reviewed Casey's file. I'd like to talk about your daughter. - She has been up most of the nights crying, she's not eating at all. How am I supposed to send her back to school? I'm afraid for her safety and well being. - I understand you're frustration, Mr. Anderson, but you really need to remain calm. Your daughter is sensing all of this negative energy. - How am I supposed to remain calm? We have the news media following us around everywhere we go. They're camped out on our front lawn for the past three days. How am I supposed to remain calm? I don't know what to do anymore. - I understand under the situation, maybe you and your family can temporarily relocate somewhere, your daughter really needs time to get away and reflect and heal from what's happened. Do you have any family, someone you can stay with, just to get away from this and all the media attention. - I don't know. Not really, maybe my sister can take us in for a while? I just don't know. - Mr. Anderson, in order to understand the complexity of what your daughter is going through, I'm going to ask what may be some very difficult questions. Where is Mrs. Anderson during all this? - She... She's been absent from our lives for a long time now. It's been really hard on us. I've been doing the best I can to make up for her mother walking out on her. - Can I ask how often she sees her mother? - She hasn't heard from her mother in more than two years. She just one day packed up her stuff and walked out, no explanation. It's been really, really hard on my daughter. She misses her mother. - I understand. I think it's best that I talk to your daughter alone. I think she'd be more inclined to open up if you're not in the room with her. - Okay. I'll just stay here. God, please help us. - Hi, I'm Dr. Conrad. It's nice to meet you. I know that this is going to be extremely difficult for you to talk about, but one of the ways that we begin to heal is by opening a line of communication. You think you can do that? - Heal? There will never be any healing from this. The damage is done. I am going to have to live the rest of my life knowing what I have done to Lauren. I am so sorry, Lauren, for what I have done. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me, I didn't mean it. Please, Lauren, forgive me. I'm so, I'm so sorry. - Why? God. Why? Why would you take my baby sister from me? I miss her so much. I love you so much, Lauren. I just don't know what I'm gonna do without you. God, please. I beg of you when my sister comes to your door, let her. Let her in. Let my baby sister in. And give her the love that she deserves. - It sure is a beautiful sunrise this morning. - Excuse me? - The sunrise. It's so beautiful. - I'm sorry, I didn't know you were there. - Tears are how our heart speaks when our lips just can't describe how much we've been hurt. It's okay, honey. It's okay to cry. - I'm sorry. I just lost my baby sister. I don't know what I'm gonna do now. - The one thing I've learned in life is the most beautiful people are the ones that have known despair, known struggle and known suffering, and have known the loss of a loved one, and found their way out of the depths of despair. It's this kind of person that has an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life. It fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep, loving concern. Beautiful people don't just happen. It's something you grow into, Addie. This. This is the beauty that this life has to offer. Just close your eyes. Make today a day worth remembering. You're gonna be okay, Addie, because you have the strength to overcome with each step that you take in life. Know that Lauren is taking them with you. She will always be with you, because you will carry her in your heart forever. - I will always love you, Addie, you know that, right? - I'm just gonna miss you so much. - You're gonna be okay, I promise. - Addie. Addie. Where did that woman go? - What woman? - The old woman I was just talking to, where did she go? - Addie, I've been standing here for a couple minutes and I didn't see anyone. - A couple of minutes? - I didn't want to interrupt you while you were praying. - Praying. Listen for the angel's voice. She will come to you. - Addie are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, just a little confused, that's all. - Well, I brought some flowers for Lauren. - They're beautiful, Timothy. Why don't we go with them to her now? Many of you didn't know my sister, Lauren. She was new at school and really didn't have time to make any friends. Lauren had a loving soul, and cared for others, and she tried very hard to cope with a bad situation at home and here at school. - When we talk to our children about bullying, we need to make sure that they know that their actions do have consequences. - I wish she could be here today so I could hold her in my arms and let her know that everything is gonna be all right, but I can't. She's not here, and the reality of the situation is overwhelming.
