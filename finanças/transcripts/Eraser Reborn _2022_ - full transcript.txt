Isn't that your schtick, bruh? - Oltcheck. - Mason. You believe this shit? Since we started this program, never been anything but happily ever after... until now. NSA swept up some chatter yesterday. Encrypted calls between the Syndicate Council. They know your witness isn't dead, Mason. I covered every base. Every move. This is your car. If it makes you feel any better, mine may have exposure, too. Is she okay? I think so. I mean, even Marshal Rhodes doesn't know where I stashed her. I heard she's a handful. Maybe she broke cover, dropped a clue. Who knows? You trust her? You taught me better than that, Paul. Our orders are to move everyone in the program. Re-erase them. I need time to figure this out. Your witness, your call. Mine, I'm extracting out. We could use a shooter and looter like you, Mason. Unless you're going straight for your witness. I got your backs. It's good to see you, bro. Now, this gonna be live. intense music playing car doors closing - Felicia, how are you, gorgeous? - Hey, Paul. - Mason, welcome back. - Thanks. Deputy Oltcheck, meet Felicia. Galloway. Strategic Surveillance Unit. Our local badge in case things get hot. She's got great assets. - Don't be a pig, Whitlock. - All right. We're plucking out one of your witnesses, huh? I can't tell you who she is or what she did, but I'd give my left nut to protect her. Let's roll. Interesting choice, Paul. Planting your witness in this shithole. This shithole is directly tied to the history of apartheid. scoffing A fancy word for what happens when people get scared. Scared enough to mobilize whole governments and laws to push black and brown people out of cities. Deprive them of access to the best jobs, electricity and running water and worse... pit them against each other. Yeah, so why don't they just go? Or buy the land, like everyone else? The game's rigged. Why buy into a system that's intent on destroying you? The rules are set up for you to fail, you do what? Change the rules of engagement, my brother. You got me shouting in this bitch. Must've been a trip, Mason, serving with this legend. More like an honor. So you dropped your witness here because you knew no one would find her? cell phone ringing Paul? She's not answering. - Nobody comes or goes. - Galloway Got it. dog barking thrilling music playing That's not cupcakes. Never said she was a saint.

Go, Felicia. Go. Patricia breathing raggedly both grunting Mason Paul. We lost her. Why send five men to kill her? Her or us? Whitlock They weren't dealers, Mace. These men were pros. It was a setup, a trap. Oltcheck Hey, Pollard. Isn't she one of yours? Call Rina Kimura, Pollard, now. I have to live-contact her. That's our arrangement. Where is she? Downtown. Okay. Let's go grab her. What you doing? Just informing Marshal Rhodes we're extracting my witness. phone vibrating metal clangs Okay. 27 Gratz Road. That's good work back there. You okay? Yeah, you? I'm tripping. Something I've to talk to you about. It's important. Come on. Yeah. You forgot the one most important thing I taught you, Mace. Never lie to me. You just texted your witness Rina Kimura 911 to bug out. I didn't forget. Why, Paul? scoffs Let's see. The public gave up on guys like us, Mace. So I gave up on them. laughing You say it enough, it starts to sound like the truth. It's the money, isn't it? Now you may not want to admit it, Mace. But there is a game here. - You make a play or you get played. - Mason grunts A common man with uncommon desire to succeed. Now you sit your save-a-hoe fixated ass court-side, and you watch me play. He was on to us. Go ahead. Aww! Don't look so heartbroken, sweetheart. I'll make it better. You burned down the whole program just to flush out one witness? That bitch stole something on her way out of her gilded cage. Something the Syndicate will pay a shit ton of money to get back. After, of course, we bury her for real. And the only way Rina Kimura gets back into the U.S. is in a body bag. You son of a bitch. You told the Syndicate she's still alive. Come on. She was never going to testify. You must have had a hunch. Why protect someone who's using you? Huh? Ah! You like her. - laughing He caught feelings. - Shut the f... No, you shut the fuck up, Mace. You see, that scares you. You don't know what to do with that. There's something I can never teach you. - What's that? - Not to care so damn much. About the job, your witnesses. When you erase someone, you start a relationship. laughing And you're okay as long as you get to play God. In control. But making a real relationship work, an equal one... You see, that never was your jam, was it, Mace? You ever had one? - Other than with me, and your abs? - Mason grunts coughs Tell me where she is. We part ways... and you can go back to playing a hero for escorts and criminals. Too late, Paul. You crossed the line. Mason grunts There is no line anymore. I erased it! Now you tell me where the fuck she is. He deleted the 911 he sent to Kimura. - I set a trap and trace. - Atta boy, Mikey. You know what? I think I'm going to call him "Mason 2.0." - Location? - NSA is locked on her cell, tracking it for us in real-time. Inform our contact. How much are they paying you? Take note, Oltcheck. He's just trying to distract us as he figures out a way to escape. Noted. Finder's fee. One for the girl, one for the wallet. Get them both. Beats babysitting scum for peanuts. You wouldn't be telling me this unless you planned on killing me. Ding! Ding! That is the plan. But only once I get the girl, and I'm sure I'm getting paid. Paul... you made a deal with the Syndicate. Make one with me. laughs Come on, you can do better than that. What can you offer me, hmm? Your life. This guy... Oltcheck, I'll make things right with the locals. Smooth the situation. You take this one to our vehicle, if you think you can handle that. Copy. - Move. - Paul. Move. thrilling music playing Rina! grunts upbeat music playing panting breathing heavily I need to know exactly what happened here, Paul. What are you talking about? The evidence is on the floor. Your plan to flush out my witness, pretty risky, Oltcheck. Shut up. What's your cut? Can't think Paul's gonna let you live to see it. He chose me for a reason, Pollard. - You really are stupid, aren't you? - I said shut the fuck up! You know, you're right about Paul. He is a legend. The first thing he taught me, improvisation... Is the art of field work. rumbling - gunshots - people screaming Sounds like some bullshit. I better go. You do that. dog barking suspenseful music playing crashing door opens gasping gunshots Move!

My price just went up. I want the wallet, too. Payment for the girl. - That wasn't our deal. - I'm changing it. This is getting complicated, expensive. Stupid. I need to talk to my people. You do that. How do we find them? Pollard blocked Rina Kimura's face, her biometrics and his own from the CCTV network that covers this entire city, like steam on shit. But... You unblocked them, so they could be tracked. - Yes, sir. - They don't realize it? Pollard will fetch Kimura, who'll be in a safe house.

He's here in Cape Town to kill you for the Syndicate. He sold out. And I never saw it coming. That's how Marco found me. Marco? An enforcer for the Syndicate. My old friend. He tried to kill me right after you sent the 911. Whitlock gave Marco your cell phone location and tracked it, with the help of Uncle Sam, and me. Our old friends are new friends. Agent Galloway has updates. Go. We caught a break off the CCTV network. A man on foot matching Pollard's description. We're Sat tracking him now and I've issued a warrant for his arrest. En route now, Marshal Rhodes. With some local backup. The Mason Pollard I know would never do this. Something we missed? Program means everything to him. That's all he's got.

I thought it'd be an insurance policy. - Keep them from killing me. - Till after they torture you, Rina. How could someone access this money? I need a secure network, very secure. The 24 words, where are they now? Jesus. The seedcode, the words, write them down, now. I need that money to start over. Then try earning it, Rina. Really? Get fucking real. It is all about the money. Kosta, Marco, Paul Whitlock. You wanna be like those people? Everybody is like them. Okay, this world is one big lying, corrupt nightmare. - Not the whole world. - Most people. And most of you. Nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop. Nobody. But you don't see that, do you?
