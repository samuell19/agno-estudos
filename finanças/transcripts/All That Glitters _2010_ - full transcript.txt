My father drives big cars. Yeah, fake ones. Where do you live? - Puteaux. - Neuilly. We live in Neuilly. Why bother lying? He doesn't care. You never know. A kid with those 2 women seems weird. He scares me with his big eyes. He's like E.T. with hair. What about your dad? He's not working today. Come on. That never stops him from coming. He won't come if he doesn't work. What's up? Why isn't he here? He's not working, that's all! The day we're worn out, he doesn't come? It's weird. You don't find it weird? Excuse me, but that's pretty weird. You're pissing me off.

Alright? It's not nice what you're doing to Eric. What? He's a nice guy, I don't understand you. There's no comparison. You know, Maxx, he's... It's strange, but it's as if he knows me by heart. Can you hear yourself? Does he know the Lila from Puteaux? The bench is for parents. - You think I give a damn? - Let's go, come on. - Hi. - Hi. I bumped into Sandy earlier. Mehdi's woman. He's the tall Arab who sold cell phones. Sandy's mother is a nurse's aide. She must have seen Auntie. Sandy said, "Yes, my mother..." And so? So I have to go see Auntie. Why tell me all this? - You asked! - I said "Hi"! And I answered. Bye. Are you picking us up tonight? Your father will. No, he can't! Come! Shut it! Pick us up at the corner! A gift! You stole it? They have everything, who cares? So? Awesome, isn't it? You like it? You're going too far. Give it back then. Give it back! Really, it's too much. Fine, take it off if it is. Can I sit down? - You have nothing else to do? - Crazy. Even when you get angry, it's not the same. There's a peacock nearby who just bought a ring. Stop! Do you realize I was her mother-in-law? What a mess. My father even told me about their sex life. He couldn't get hard! True, he couldn't. I told him he wasn't hot enough for a ménage à trois. She wanted to give him Viagra. Can you imagine? - Yeah! - Yeah... You're still eating? Stop or you'll get fat. Fatty! Don't listen to her, my love. Eat, eat. Stop. - He's adopted you. - Really. - He really looks like you. - Really? That's strange, Joan's his mother. - OK! - OK! It's the eyes. Try the moshi moshi, It's delicious. Good, isn't it?

She's funny. - Yeah. - There's no one else like her. - Don't eat that. - She's super good. Because every sport, in fact... Isn't it good? It's moshi moshi. OK. It's super good. It was amazing. Thanks a lot. Ciao, drive safely. - Bye. - We'll give you a call, Carole. No problem. - Bye! - Bye! Let's get together soon for moshi moshi! That was so stressful! They liked Carole. They like you, Carole! Remember when she shouted? Good thing she didn't talk about Mrs. Houbloup! I was freaking out. Carole? - That was great, thanks. - Really? Fuck off! - It wasn't so bad. - "Wasn't so bad"? "It wasn't so bad"? I'm no damn chick you've known for 15 min! - Are you ashamed of me? - No. Drop me off at Neuilly, please. Drop dead! - You're going to Neuilly? - To see Maxx. - Are you serious? - Yes. - No. - Yes, I am. - Carole! - No. I've had enough of these situations. Don't be a ball and chain. - Asking me to drop her off? - Carole! I swear on Auntie's head, I'm not taking you. I'm a ball and chain? - Two balls. Are you serious? - I swear. - You swear? - I swear. - Bravo. - Bravo to you! - Some friends you are! - You too! - You make me sick. - I'm a ball and chain? - Do I give her a lift? - I'm a ball and chain? - Do I give her a lift? - She's too funny. - What? - The heels! Here you go. I swore, so do I give her lift? Here, stick them up your ass. As if I would swear and still give her a lift. - I screwed you, it's Saturday. - Loser! I swear I won't give her a lift. She's gone. Let's go! I swear I'm not dropping her off. I swear! - Are you serious? - I'm not dropping her off! She's gone! You scared me. - What's your code? - Ely's sleeping. I don't care. What's your code? What floor? Fourth. Isn't it better here? Hi, I'd like some popcorn. Why are you here? I wanted some popcorn. - Small, medium or large? - Large, please. Anything else? That's it, thanks. How are you paying for that? With this. Is that OK? Isn't it what you wanted? Yes, it is. It's just that... My manager's here. I'll call you. - You never call. - I'll call you later. - Tell me what's wrong! - Nothing, I'll call you! Lila... How many times have I told you? The logo faces the front. Redo all of them, please. If you don't like it, there's the exit. There you go. Fuck off! I don't need you! - Is there a problem, Sandra? - No, no. I won't be back this weekend. It's crazy how much you're like your father! It's nice, you're 10 min away from Paris. It's quiet, there's no pollution. It's nice! You're 10 minutes from everything. Your father went to great lengths to get this apartment, because building X wasn't cheap. It's nice, isn't it, Maurice? I haven't seen the bathroom. - Stop or I'll spit on you. - Mom! Enough, Ely! And you stop it. It's her! Well? Do you like it? Don't you want something better for me? Better? - You're 10 min from everything. - I don't give a shit! It's been the same all our lives. I want more! Don't you understand? Madam spits on the view that all of Puteaux wants! - We'll think about it. - That's all you can say! I told you it would piss her off. You never say anything! The Flintstones! Hi, Ely! You're not in bed? Thanks, you're a savior. I ordered some sushi for you. Ciao. Hi. Come on, let's go play. Come on, we'll have fun. We'll have fun? It's really nice!

It's always the same. - Fine, let's go. - Well, yes. - Got your keys? - Yes, yes. - I won't take mine. - Well, no. Hello, Uncle! We thought you'd changed your minds. - Mom's here? - She got here a while ago. Hey, mannequin! - When's Ely moving? - Not right away. - There's too much work? - She wants to be in Paris. What will she do there? You can't afford it! She's young, she wants to go. Ely! Helicopter! Maurice, you never imposed, that's your mistake. You need to set down rules! If you don't, she'll take advantage. She doesn't want a crap life like yours! Calm down! Do I get involved in your children's education? He worked all night, he's tired. We're just talking. He's so sensitive! Mom, stop adding salt. - Chocolate roll? Eclair? - No. - Macaroon? - No. - What, then? - Candy. That's no snack. Hey there. He was scared. I'll put him to bed. No, it's fine. I'll do it. How's Lila doing? Fine. I saw Maxx earlier. I think he made the right decision. - You didn't know? - Yeah, I did. She knew he had a girlfriend. Yeah. - Taxi! - Yeah, shit. - Go on, it's paid. Thanks. - Thanks. Yeah, Ely. How are you? No, I couldn't call. I'll explain. We should get together. I have so much to tell you. Were you invited to Agathe and Joan's party tonight? I'll come with you, then! Come get me, then? OK, kisses. I missed you a lot. Bye. Lila! I know you're there! Damn! Remember this dress? It didn't fit me before. I'm so happy it does now. Why did it take you so long to call me? They told me you didn't work at the cinema anymore. That bitch said that? She gets a kick out of causing trouble. You don't realize? She's jealous! She does it to screw things up! Shit! Are you going like that? Why not? - That jacket! - Really? You're going to an interview? Mom! - No. - Damn! Stop with this stupid music! - Are they cool or what? - Seriously! Aren't they awesome? A gift from Maxx. - But you're not with Maxx. - What? Are you sick? Things are going pretty good. But we prefer to keep it a secret to protect ourselves. As you can see, people talk. Have you spoken to Eric? We've settled things. He calls me all the time... I told you it's settled. You like it? It looks really good on you. Let's go. But tighten it. - Cinch the waist. - Like that? Stop wearing black. Lighter colors are better. Hi, how are you, my love? - Glad to see me? - Yes. Me too. Left knee up to your right shoulder. Lift your head up. Feel yourself getting taller. And relax. That's all for today. Hello! - Hello! - Hello. We need to talk after I shower. I'll come with you. Thanks, Carole. See you next week. Sounds good. - Bye. - Bye. "I'll come with you"? They shower together. - How are you? - Hear that? Not ashamed to say hi to me here? Calm down! You got work thanks to us. Shit, listen to you! You make me sick. - Wait, Carole! - Forget it! She's lost it! She thinks she's God's gift! - Honestly... - See how she's talking? They shower together. Imagine the two of us. You're good? - Yeah. - Yeah. Elvis really likes you. Thanks. I like him too. My favorite ring disappeared. No, did you look everywhere? - Yes. I wonder... It was Carole. - Carole? - Yes. Wait, it can't be... Is this it? Yes! I don't understand, I looked everywhere, I couldn't find it. Get ready, there are people waiting for you. Side-step. You've done dance. Side-step. No! Left! Once again. - It's stupid. - You're pushy. - Listen! - Yes! We hop, and back. Hello? Yeah, I'll get her. Who is it? Hello? I didn't hear it. It was in my bag. What? Where downstairs? I'm coming up. It's OK, I'll come down. I said, I'm coming down! Shit! Shit! - I'll be back in 5. - No! You can practice! Why are you avoiding me? Think I'm an idiot? People talk about you. Whose house is this? - Don't shout. Come on. - Let's go up! Introduce me... - Your new man's upstairs? - That's nonsense. What are you scared of? Don't want to show off now? Introduce your buddies! Get in now! Want a lift? Here. Let's go. I don't live here. Thanks. What were you doing? - Nothing, he gave me a lift. - To Puteaux? Stop this... Screw up your life, not mine. Don't bring him here. But no one gives a damn... Stay in your shitty ghetto. It suits you. Who do you think you are? Think you're better with your expensive heels? - You're so jealous. - Me? Since forever because people like me. I'm Maxx's girlfriend. Nobody looks at you. Stop with your lies. You know you're not his girlfriend. - You wish. - You look like an idiot! Really? Why? - Because a rich guy notices me? - Stop it! He doesn't give a damn, you're one out of a billion! Really? He said he loves me. He said he loves me! Look at you, you're crazy. Just like your mother. Know what your life will be like? How you'll end up? You'll rot here like your loser parents, because you're a big loser. You're really a piece of shit. Don't ever talk to me again. Listen to me good. I prefer to die than talk to you again. Look at me. Taken your shoes off? Maxx, it's Lila, it's not what you think. Please call me, I have to talk to you. Shit, call me back. Call me back, shit! Maxx, it's me again. Shit, call me back! We have to talk. Call me back! I didn't want to lie. I wanted to tell you everything, but I couldn't. It doesn't matter. I'll explain it all. I promise you, I didn't want to lie. I know it's hard for you right now, but we love each other. We've experienced so much... give us a chance. Let me prove it to you. Here, take a taxi. Get some rest and forget about me, please. Forget about me. - Agathe. - No. Button up your coat. It's not cold, doesn't matter. - Your hair looks very nice. - Think so? I go to Ramirez. Did you get it colored? No, just a blow-dry. - Your roots needed doing. - No! Mom, please! She told me 10 min, OK? I waited half an hour in the car. Here you go. Anna, can you help me? She didn't even apologize. - Yeah. - Who is it? - Press 9, 7, 4. - Who is it? See you. - Who is it? - Agathe and Joan. Are you serious? - Relax, they brought you a gift. - Yes? Come up! - No! - It's the 3rd floor. You let them in and you don't know them? I thought they'd come for lunch. Oh, shit... Go get dressed. - But, we are dressed. - Better. OK. I didn't understand. Where are the candles? In the sideboard. The paper chicks! Let's go, come on! Hello. - Hello. - Hello. My love, you're so heavy, too heavy. - What's this? A gift? - A thank you for babysitting him. Thanks, that's very nice. Thanks, darling. - Hello. - Hello. Come in! That's very nice, but we must go. - Are you busy this weekend? - No. Can you keep Elvis? We're going away. OK. That's great. Thanks. Thanks. It's OK if he misses school on Monday. - Ciao! - Ciao. Bye. Glad to be here? - Your mink coat! - He's so cute! - And your Bar Mitzvah dress! - It's a carnival. - Shush! Don't shout! - Why, what's wrong? Why did you wear your mink coat? And you... You told us to dress up. - They're dressed up. - How embarrassing. - You're not listening to me. - Yes, I am. - You're not listening. - I am. You said it'll be crappy if you don't pass your exam... You don't want to go and play? Jordan, stop that! Your mother's a cashier. Hello? Yes, Agathe told me about you. I have a spot... Tuesday from 6-8 PM. OK, your address? OK, got that: abs and butt. Tuesday, then. Bye. If you hit him again, I'll hit you. - He says my mother's a cashier. Why did you say that? Because it's true! - It's true? - Yes. So what? - Heard from her? - Who? Heard from Lila? Leave her be, she'll be back. I don't care, anyway. Is there something else? Everything's screwed up. - You want to live in Paris? - That's not it. - It's... - Your father doesn't get you? You'll sort things out. Talk to him calmly, but firmly. I don't have the answer... Jordan, if I catch you, you'll get it good! Calmly, but firmly. You always hear about the rabbits that are there. There are loads, I park here. The convention centre is here, the rabbits there. I've never seen them. Sonia, can I have 2 veggies? Thanks. See you tomorrow! Why 2? - I always take 2. - You're only allowed 1. You're kidding me? No. - So you're just stirring shit up. - That's it, exactly! Give this to your whore girlfriend. Know what? Go fuck yourself with your crappy sandwiches! There are sockets all over. - That one's for the TV? - Yes. Ely! Ely-popotamus! - Ely-xir! - What? Nothing. I'm at Momo's. - How are you? - Fine. Just trying to make conversation... That's what we're doing. You'll be living here? No, I'm swapping with Carole. It's Carole? A pity. No, seriously... You're cute, that's why... - Thanks. - It's true. When you wake up, you have this beautiful view. - The Eiffel Tower... - Yeah. - It's nice. - I think she likes it. I like it. Don't worry, just put them in. I got the results. - You didn't pass? - No. You know what? It's not that big a deal. You don't really need this diploma. - Yes, but well... - What? Hurry up, I have to return the truck in 2 hrs. Pascal said, "Bring it back in 2 hrs or..." It's fine. - But... - Let's go! - Move it! - I'm not your slave! Here, it's enough to fill up the fridge. It's full, and heavy too! - I'll call when I get there. - Don't forget. - Or I'll call you? - No, I'll call you. Kisses. Someone take the suitcase. It's heavy, Slim, move it! Here, take it. You're moving, then? Wait, I need to talk to you. - You'll just talk rubbish. - No, I swear. I'll explain. I know I screwed up. But let me explain. I need to talk to you, Ely, please. Come on! Come on, it's the last. - What did she say? - Just another lie. Come on, we're ready to go! You're the one not moving your ass. You're useless, like a dummy. Let's go, Carole! Why does it take you 3 hrs, Slim? - I'm trying. - Don't you have a date? You're just like my cousin. I love it, I'm so happy. Why is this bag here? - It was with the boxes. - Yeah. It's Lila's! - How would we know? - We didn't know. Give it to her, I don't want her shitty bag. We worked our asses off to help you and you order us around? I'm not taking it. - Anna... - For how much? - You're serious? - Yes. Seriously? Slim, would you mind? If you want... Well, maybe another time. Are you a cop or what? What's it to you? You're pissing me off. I have to return Pascal's van. He said, "If you're not back in 2 hrs..." - Fine. - He won't lend it to me again. You're all leaving? - We don't even get a thank you. - Not even. Alone to do all of this. I can stay, if you want. - No, it's fine. - Slim! Gotta go. Thank you! I'm glad you're here. They were pretty good tonight. How long are you going to do this? - You know your father... - Stop, he's not coming. - Lila... - He said he isn't coming back! You need to stop all this. Do something else. He's started a new life! He's never coming back. Come on, let's go. Let's go, Mom. Key master! He actually has lots of keys. You're such a pain. You're the kind of girl you can't say anything to. You're too sensitive. You don't even know what that means. Yes, I do. Stop talking to me about Ely or I won't talk to you. I'm serious. Gotta run. I'll call you later? Yeah. This situation is all messed up. It's you who's messed up. Come on, faster, last lap! Hello. I'm here to see Jill. - Do you have an appointment? - Obviously. - What's your name? - Lila Belaifa. - One moment. - Thank you. I love this. - We have an appointment? - Yes. I never make appointments. Yes, we met a month ago. I was in Tokyo a month ago. - Do you have a sister? - No. A brother? Follow me. The ring... Maybe a cousin? Hey, Parisian! You OK? Yeah! We don't see you anymore. Call me, then! - Really? - Well, yes. That's awesome. Wait, do I have your number? Yeah, I have it. Yes? Everything OK, Ely? Lila? No, she's not here. Yes, I gave her all your messages. No, you can't come up, I'm in a meeting. Yes, you can drop it off another time, OK? Bye, dear. Kisses. Thanks. So? - Would you wear them? - Honestly? I have them and I wear them every day. They hurt too much to walk. Wear them but don't walk too much in them. Yeah. - Who cares? My man's paying. - Then take them! Darling? - Do you like them? - Great, I love them. I'll take them. - You look great in them. - Thanks. This way. 650, please. Thanks. I owe you 50, no? Have a good day. Thank you. I'm going... The chick said to me, "I'm going away this weekend. "Can you come at 3 PM instead?" Is that crazy or what? Isn't that crazy? - What? - Isn't it crazy? She only moved her appointment. She's going away this weekend. So what? It's normal to leave for the weekend on a Wednesday? Does Lila sleep here? I'm in a rush, I have to be in Paris in 20 min. - Tell me if she sleeps here. - She doesn't sleep here. - She doesn't sleep here? - No. What's this, then? - I don't know, she forgot it. - Forgot it? - Yes. - She forgot it? OK, she sleeps here sometimes. I've had enough of you two! I don't tell on you, so don't expect me to tell on others. Don't be a pain, tell me where she is. Stop! Can't you see it's finished? Forget it. Let's go. - You're dropping me off? - At Saint-Germain. It's too far from mine. - Take the subway. - I'm sick of it. - Get your license! - I don't want to! Piss off then! Shit. Enough of this shit. - Move it! I'm running late! - Two minutes! Damn it! Wait, Carole! I'll be right there. You're a pain! - Mrs. Houbloup! - Hi, Ely. Sophie! She's so beautiful. I love dogs. Not like Lila, she hates dogs. Really? She's like my hairdresser. She says she can't stand their smell. I actually don't like the way she smells. She has a rank smell. Like Lila, in fact. She smells too? No, not at all. Do you have news about Lila? I was told not to say anything, especially to you. I understand, it's normal. But did you hear about the Peverilis? - Their youngest got an abortion. - No. Everyone knows that. No, their eldest son is in pris... He's in prison? For what? - They told me... I can't. - I won't tell anyone. If you tell me, I'll tell you. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. You OK? Yes. - And you? - I'm OK. - You're OK? - I'm OK. I worked on a new one. Good. What's that? The peacock that stuffed himself but is still hungry. I have one. What's that? The peacock that stuffed himself but his stomach hurts. - That wasn't good. - It was pretty good. I have to go. - Now? - Yeah, it's for work. Well... bye. - Want a lift? - No, it's OK. - It's fine, come on! - No, thanks. - Don't be a pain! - You're a pain! Shut up! - Good evening. - Good evening. The Avenue de l'Opéra. You're sisters? I can tell you're siblings. You're lucky. I don't have siblings. But I have a dog. They say a dog is a man's best friend. - Let's do it? - Let's do it! What's that? What are you doing? You're lucky I'm wearing my cowboy boots! Hey! Shit! Subtitles: Eclair Media
