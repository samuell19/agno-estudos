Well that's, that's, that's a very beautiful name. Uh, “mira,” to see, right? The one who saw? [radio reporter] The promising campaign of Richard Alvarez for Maverick County Sheriff. Federal tax officials launched an investigation into allegedly fraudulent tax return filed by three of Alvarez's six South Texas car dealerships. Mr. Alvarez released a statement denying the affair with the housekeeper, and reassuring the community that he would be absolved of all wrong-doing in the investigation by the Internal Revenue Service. Nevertheless, Maverick County supervisors quickly withdrew their endorsement of Mr. Alvarez in the race for sheriff, suddenly leaving incumbent Sheriff Grant Johnson in excellent position to reclaim the seat that he and his family have controlled for over 30 years. Johnson has been struggling to overcome his waning popularity in the face of increasing violence in the county highlighted by last weekend's bloodshed at Eagle Pass. You remember Sheriff Johnson, don't you, Billy? I sure do. How you doing, Sheriff? Good, Billy. I'm doing good. Have you ever been out to the old McKinley Ranch? McKinley Ranch? Um, I don't know. Well, we found some tire tracks out there, right where we found those bodies. -Is that right? -Yeah, that's right. Looks like a Bronco might've passed through. Well, Sheriff, you got it all wrong. I mean, I... Billy, Billy, it's all right. Sheriff's not accusing you of nothin'. I mean now we's not the only Bronco passin' through that area. Sheriff knows that. Our boys are out there all the time. Just not last night. Of course, we been working out that Eagle Pass bust for quite a while, you know. [Grant] Let me ask you something, Billy. You see anything strange last night? Well, yeah. I seen something real strange. I never seen nothing like that before in my whole life, all that shooting and all, but... It's like I told you, Sheriff. None of my boys seen nothing. But, uh, be happy to keep checking into it for you. [screen door slams] Good luck in the election, Sheriff. [door closes] What the hell's the matter with you? Can't you keep your goddamn mouth shut? I’m, I’m sorry, Walt. I was just trying to answer his questions the best I could. Oh, Mr. Harmon. I fell asleep... a few minutes before you come. Miranda, why didn't you tell me you had no place to stay? I have a place. I just tired. Don't lie to me, Miranda. I can't have my employees with no place to sleep. Where are you gonna take a shower and all? -Do I smell bad, Mr. Harmon? -No, no, no. You know what I mean. Mr. Harmon, I gonna find a place. I promise. I just need my first money. All right. I'll give you an advance today. But I want an address from you right away. You understand? Yes, sir. Right away. What about that new kid? What's his name? Billy Mercer. Yeah, Billy. Well, he's doing all right I guess. I mean, uh... all things considered. You sure? Oh, I don't know. I don't know. He gets this funny look in his eyes sometime like he's thinking too much. I think it was a mistake to take him up to Eagle Pass. Ty, boy's riding in my truck. We was gonna have to clue him in sooner or later. Well, is he with us or not? I don't think the boy's made up his mind yet. Well that, by God, is not gonna flush.
