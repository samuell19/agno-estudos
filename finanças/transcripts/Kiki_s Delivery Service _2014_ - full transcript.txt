Subtitle from Viu Resync by amin20thapril This is the tale of a town in Asia that believes in witches. One winter, in a village in the mountains... a girl named Kiki was born. Over here, see? That's scary! You hate that sound, don't you. Come on! There, there! Did he scare you? Kiki had a little secret. Yep. There's lots of fish in there. Who are you talking to, Kiki? Jiji. Her father Okino was a scholar, a normal human being. But her mother Kokiri was a witch! Ow! She had two kinds of magic. One was making medicinal potions from herbs she grew. Thank you. And thank you There was no hospital near the village... and everyone depended on Kokiri. Then there was her other kind... I'll just go deliver these. OK. Hey, where's Kiki? Isn't she with you? Kokiri could fly on a broom. Kiki learned very quickly to fly, as well. You be careful, Kiki. Pay attention. I know! But sometimes... You're still too young to help. Right, Jiji? You're still too young. You're neither witch nor woman. Neither? You're in between witches and human beings. You have until you're 13 to decide which you want to be. I want to be a witch! Then I can ride on a broom. You like flying? Yeah! When a witch turns 13... she must set out on a journey when the moon is full. All alone, she must leave home... find a town that has no witches, and live there for a year. While in training, she cannot return to her parents' home. When she has lived a year on her own magic... she is finally a full-fledged witch. This important rule is there so the world will know... that witches still exist. Goodbye! Thanks! She's grown so big! You take care of yourself, all right? Thank you. She's going off alone! Hey! You're embarrassing me! If it doesn't work out, come home. You spoil her! Too bad! That's not going to happen. Thanks. Good luck. Jiji! Take care, now! Good luck! Go for it! Good luck! Take care. Jiji, look after her. Dad, Mom... ...stay well. I'll see you! Off you go! Good luck! Bye-bye! KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE Planning Tomiko Ogawa Kiyoshi Matsue Producer Haruo Umekawa Based on the novel by Eiko Kadono Screenplay Satoko Okudera & Takashi Shimizu Music Taro Iwashiro Directed by Takashi Shimizu Jiji, are you cold? Yes. If you don't mind... Look. Is that the sea? It's the sea! Could it be that big? It's just a big puddle, right? Wow! It's warming up! Hey, wait... Careful! That's cold! It feels so good! Yahoo! Be careful, will you! Look, I can see a town. Let's try there. Look at those fish, Jiji! Yummy! We could never eat them all. Good morning! Look at all those people! Look! Up there! They look a little surprised. Maybe there hasn't been a witch here for a while. Tombo! Tombo! Look! Someone's flying! Should we stay here? 'Think carefully.' That's what your mom told you. It's pretty. It looks OK. It suits you. No, it doesn't. It suits you. Not you, too! Mom, make it a bit shorter. No. You should look prim and proper. I'm the one who's leaving. How about this? Witches dress in pure black. Ever since the old days. Stand there. 'The old days'... that's so out of date! You come from an old line of witches. But all I can do is fly. That's all the magic you bothered to learn. What about you? Grandma had lots of powers. That's true. She could keep fish and meat fresh, and make cows give more milk. You're right. You say to look prim and proper, and to be restrained. But doesn't that kill magic? Sometimes you need to hold back. Witches have survived this long... by helping where they can and changing how people think. I'm different from witches of your age. I don't want to worry about what people think. I want to do what I want. Look, Kiki... you can't become a witch without doing a year of training. Even if it doesn't go well... you have to keep smiling. I know. You've told me a million times. Good morning, everybody in Koriko. Good morning. That was a heavy rain last night. We at Koriko News apologize for our forecast being wrong. Did you get wet because you didn't have an umbrella? Thanks for letting me stay. I needed somewhere. Huh? What are you doing here?! Sorry! A runaway! No! I'll call the police. Let go! Atchi! Morio! Someone's in here! I didn't run away! Help me! I'm a witch. A witch?! I'm still in training. A witch! They exist! I'm sorry. Thanks. What did you do to these animals?! Nothing. I just slept here. Go away and don't come back! Nazuru, cut it out! What are you doing?! Go away! Stop it! Was that such a bad thing to do? He must be afraid of witches. Look. Something sure smells good! It's a bakery! That smells good! I'm starving! Yep. Breakfast first. I'll see you! Hey! We serve food here. Leave the broom outside! I'm sorry! Sorry. Mom's potions. I said I didn't want them. You can't eat them. 'Keep smiling' ...yeah, I know! Hey! Yes. Your skirt's torn at the back. I thought you were a cleaner. Every witch carries her own broom. So you're a witch? Can you do magic? Just one kind. I can fly. That's really something! Show me how to fly. I'm afraid you can't. It's in the blood. So that's how it is? I have to live alone on my magic in another town for a year. There. Look! Thank you! That's great! But what are you going to do, living alone at your age? I was thinking of starting a delivery service. Really? Yes. I've always helped my mother doing that. I take things and carry them far, far away. That makes people happy, so I thought it could be my work. It's a good idea. 'Kiki's Delivery Service'. You think so? With all these islands... even if you're in a hurry you have to wait for a boat. But with you... I could just fly over! That's settled, then. Come on. It's a windmill! That's my husband Fukuo. Keep your head in! There's a well right outside. We'll get this place cleaned up. You can find a better room later. I'm saying you can stay here. That would really help. It showed in your face. Ma'am... Call me Osono. I like you. It'll be fun with a witch here. Thank you, Osono! Come on. Town of Koriko We're in business! Great! Kiki's Delivery Service Who was I with? That's a secret. But it's the prettiest spot in all of Koriko. I recommend you go there. And with that we bid you good night. 'From Koriko Harbor'... We've come a long way, Jiji. Whether you had a good day or a bad one... today was today, and tomorrow is tomorrow. May it be a fine day for everyone. And now, to say good night, here is Kara Takami, with 'Voice'. "Dreaming yesterday's dreams" "Searching for the road ahead" "Who cares if you don't know" "what tomorrow will bring?" "So close your eyes" "to those little things" It's quiet when you're alone. "Sing it, non-no hey" "Sing it with me every day" "Laugh it off and start to run" "Let's move forward" "And start to sing, non-no hey" "Be together every day" "Even if we're fleeing sadness" Kiki's Delivery Service Anything taken anywhere, faster! Kiki's... Buy Bye Bakery... Oh, yes. Thank you for calling. The usual? All right. Kiki's Delivery Service! Will you ever get a call? Be quiet. It took our bakery three years to build up enough customers. Three years?! My training will be over before anyone calls. Things don't just go well right from the start. Try doing some advertising. Hello. Here. A delivery? Kiki! Take this. Sure! Uh, where? Cape Yomena School. As fast as you can. Sure! 'Cape Yomena'... Actually, this is my first job. You're my first customer... Here it is! Cape Yomena! What's your name... Who should I give it to? Go to Cape whatever and see. He said he's in a hurry. That Way. Thank you. On delivery Here she comes! Wow! Wow! Here's your delivery. Wow! How does she fly? Your delivery... Let's open this up... Tombo! You're fast! I couldn't keep up. Real fast! Did you film her? Yeah! Good. Two kilometers as the crow flies. Time? 2 minutes 41.08 seconds. What?! Impossible! How do you fly? Look. look at this On the broom. What's the trick? The trick? To flying. We know a bit about aeronautics. We're studying how to fly with human power. Does it use batteries? Look! Hey! You just wanted to see someone fly on a broom? Is that all? This wasn't a delivery? Oh, thanks. I'll pay you. No, thank you. She's angry, Tombo. Don't bother me at work. Not that you have any. Be quiet! Wow! Cool! What's wrong with those kids?! How rude! I thought at last I had a job! Ms Witch! Kiki! Don't look so mad! A delivery? Can you come with me? I'm in a hurry! This way! Hurry! Sumire Cleaning In here! Quick! Hurry! Quick! Here. Fix this. Deliver a washing machine? No! It's broken. Fix it. Fix it. You need an electrician. They're closed till Monday. I need it sooner. I can't fix it. Aren't you a witch? I deliver things. Can't you fix things? Not with my magic. It's different magic? Yes. Really? Come with me. I'm in a hurry. Higher! Go higher! Higher! It's not that easy! They're dragging! Fly right! It's too windy! Hang in there! OK? Keep going! The wind... It's stopped... Right! Hey, what's that? Kiki? Is that work? Watch! Here I go! Are you having fun? I am, too! I'd never have made it without you. Sorry it's late. What a great way to dry clothes! I saw my blouse flapping up there. So witches really exist! Is she working here? She doesn't do magic, she does... what? Deliveries. I need something delivered. Me, too! Wait... Give them to me. I'll deliver them all! Here you go. It's from Grandma! Thanks! What could it be? Look, Mom! It's Maruko! Isn't that nice! Do witches really turn bad children into toads? I'll turn you into a toad! Delivery! From your son. Oh, yes! These. Good! Congratulations! A present for you! It's going great! The year will be over before we know it. What are you talking about? You've only just started. Can't you say something nice? Like 'Kiki, you're wonderful!' Hmph! Kiki, you're wonderful! You're doing great! 'Laugh it off and start to run 'Until our hearts burst 'Let's sing, non-no hey 'Be together every day 'Laugh it off, start to run 'Until our hearts burst' Fukuo! What song is that? 'Kara Takami'... That was one of her songs? That record again? He's been a Kara Takami fan for years. The first time we met was at one of her concerts. That's so cool! It's a great song. I went to sleep to it the first night I stayed here. Play it for her. But she hasn't sung for the last two or three years. Did she retire? What, did she quit? She's shut herself away... in her strange house. She has a beautiful voice. It's a shame. Let's send her something. I'll deliver it! Hey, is that your broom?! She's coming! Kiki! Here. What's wrong? I'll follow them! Kiki! Can't you ride a bike?! Hey! She's after us! Sorry! Hey! Hey! What are you doing?! Quick! Natsume! Catch! Hey! Stay out of my house! Sorry! Look out! Hey! What's wrong? Are you OK? Why did you steal my broom?! What do you think you're doing? Tombo... We just wanted to borrow it. OK, here. There's nothing here. It's just a broom. OK? You want to sweep up? Do you really fly by magic? There's no such thing. Look... I fly because I'm a witch and I can use magic. If you're not a witch, you can't fly. Tough luck. So you want to fly? No! Why not? Stay away! Ow! You want to fly by magic? Stop saying that! I should go. This isn't a game to me. Cool! I wish I was a witch. Wow! Tombo... you'd be cooler in your plane then she is on her broom. Yeah! That looks like Kara's house. Is this really the place? Osono said it was a strange place. Hello? Is anyone here? It feels like it's haunted. Uh...hello? Wait! Forgive me for barging in! Sorry. I'm sorry. Are you Kara Takami? You're a witch? Yes. What do you want here? Um... Um... A big fan of yours asked me to deliver these. Here you are. Oh? Thanks. Um... could I ask you to sign something? Sure. A receipt? No. This. I'm sorry. I'm not a singer any more. Are you a witch? Yes. I'm still in training. My mom was a witch. Sari! Look. Sari... My sister. This girl's mother. She flew better than anyone. But one day she was caught in a wind shear and fell... into the sea. After she died, I lost my voice. I love your singing. You heard this record, right? I can't sing like that now. When I sing, I don't enjoy it. You can't sing on an empty heart. Your heart's empty? The music's gone from inside me. Why? It wasn't necessary any more. That's not true! You wouldn't understand yet. This is from Fukuo the baker and his wife. They met at one of your concerts. They're expecting a baby. Oh. One night when I couldn't sleep I heard a song of yours. I was worried. I didn't know how things would go. But when I heard you, that worry vanished like magic! Then magic me back my voice! If there's nothing else, go away. I will. But one day I want to hear you sing. She loves to sing but she can't? Why not? Kiki... where's the record? I forgot it! Oh, no! Is this you? You look happy! There's the witch. When I grow up, can I fly, too? I'm swelling right up. What month are you? The eighth. I was cleaning house until the day before. That's amazing! There you go. Thank you. Thank you. I'll see you, Kiki. Take care. Here is the Koriko News. Maruko the hippo, whose tail was bitten by the lion cub... ...is still feeling poorly. Is Maruko that baby hippo? We now go live to Kajika at the Zoo. Kajika, are you there? Kajika here... reporting live from Koriko Zoo. A large crowd is here for Maruko the hippo... who was injured last week. Mr Zookeeper, will Maruko be all right? We at the Zoo here are very concerned. We are trying to find Dr Ishi, the veterinarian. Has he gone again? Dr Ishi! Where are you?! Nazuru! Could you tell us... how Maruko's tail came to be bitten? Kaito the lion is teething now, and her teeth itch. She saw Maruko's tail wagging in front of her... That's not true! Kaito would never do that! It's that witch's fault! That witch brought a curse! A curse, huh? A curse? How rude! Her tail got bit? That must hurt. Will she be OK? Shall we go see her? They'll just ask why that witch came back. Hello. A delivery. Kiki, a customer. Hello. Hi. Could you take this? Ok. It's to a friend. A girl named Taka. She'll be in Acacia Street Park. All right. Just a moment. Are you really a witch? Yes. I'm in training. There was a witch here about a hundred years ago. Really? My great-grandmother said so. Lots of people depended on her, but some didn't like that. Why not? Magic is weird. Only witches use it. If you're bad, Great-grandma said... they touch you and you turn into a mouse! Witches don't do that. So that's a lie? I've always believed in witches. I'm glad I met you. What's your name? My name's Saki, 'S A K I'. 'Saki'. So you'll deliver it? Sure! That Saki thinks she's so cute! She was just in the washroom gazing in the mirror! Is Taka here? Are you Taka? Yes. Saki asked me to deliver this to you. A witch? From Saki? That means... Here. Wait! Take this letter. It's for you. She's brought a curse! Run! A curse? No! It's a letter! Look! There she is! She'll curse you! She'll curse you! Why don't we go home, Kiki? It's no use fighting it. Saki! Thanks for taking that. This is... for you. No. I can't take this. Um... I couldn't deliver it. I'm sorry. Ta-da! Those girls talk about me behind my back. They say I act different around boys. This was to get back at them. She'll bring a curse, I said. Those idiots were scared of you! Now I feel better! They won't like you for getting back at them. I don't care! I don't want to be friends with them anyway. And me. I don't have any friends here. People ask me to deliver things, so I'm not lonely... but I wish I had a friend to laugh or eat ice cream with. I was happy when you said you were glad to meet me. Just put up a sign that says 'no curses carried'. What's my real job here, anyway? It's a job you chose. A curse?! There's been a mistake. She delivers things. She doesn't bring evil! Maruko! No! Why? What about Maruko? We'll buy you another one. Why?! No! No! Take this! You can have it. Grandma gave it to me! Oh, Mia! Stop crying! Everything I've delivered... Take them back. Tell everyone that flying is the only magic you have. Kiki? Kiki! Kiki... they're saying bad things about witches. I just wanted to be... someone who brings good things. All I want to bring... is good feelings from whoever sends me. Sorry...Temporarily Closed Kiki? Kiki? Kiki! Take this for me. I'm all swollen up and I have to lie down. This is no time to be off work. Get going! Huh? Hey! Are you OK? Fly right! What's going on?! Be careful! Concentrate! My broom's weird! It's you, not your broom. It's the broom! It's not me! It's you. Just be quiet, will you! Whoops! Suit yourself, then! Jiji! Jiji! Where are you? Jiji... Answer me, will you! Jiji, please! Jiji... You stupid broom! Do you want to end up sweeping floors?! Fly! Fly! What's wrong? What's wrong with me? Where's my magic? Here you are. Here's your delivery. I'm sorry it took so long. Stop! Stop! Is this OK? Sure! Watch. One, two, three! Let go! No! You can't fly now! The wind's wrong! Hey! Open your eyes! Tombo! Hey! Tombo! Here he is! Over here! Hurry! Tombo! Jiji... Mom... my magic's gone away. It's strange. If I don't put my heart in it, my potions don't work. I love making them more than anything. They help people, after all. But your heart has to be full. Maybe I can't be a witch any more. Whatever happens, keep smiling. Jiji! Jiji! I'm back. Welcome home. I'm sorry about what happened. I'm giving up being a witch. Yeah? OK. Why are you quitting? Don't you have to finish your training to be a witch? Yes. And if you don't? Do you vanish like foam? No. I live my life as a normal human being. That's fine, then. It's not that bad, you know. I've never been bored, anyway. I wonder if my parents will be disappointed... Don't let that worry you. I'll be happy as long as this child is safe and healthy. That's what parents think. Hello. I'm sorry, we're closed today. You forgot this. You fixed it? You need it, right? Thank you. Are you OK? What, this? See? What did you put on it? It stopped hurting right away. Even the doctor asked what kind of medicine it was. It's a potion my mom made. Don't worry. There's no curse in it. But it must be valuable. Why did you waste it on me? I couldn't leave you in pain. I'm Kiki. You're Tombo, right? Yeah. I'll see you. Tombo! Do you want to have lunch with me? So your plane got wrecked... I'll make another one. Last year I managed to fly once. Really? Flying time, eight seconds. But it felt longer. Everything looked different from in the air. The sea, the mountains, the town, they were all shining. It was beautiful. The first planes I made were toy ones for my brothers. Then I started making them bigger. I got a library book on aeronautics and started thinking how I could fly. That's all I thought about. Oh, right... You can fly. Why can't I? I can't fly, either. What? I can't fly any more. Is it a technical problem? No. They say that what a witch feels her broom feels, too. I know that. But... if I can't fly, I'm not a witch. So then what? If I can't go on with my training, I'll have to leave. Leave everyone behind. And I used to be good at flying. What's up with that? There's nothing else I can do. I can't sing. I can't ride a bike, I can't bake decent bread. I can't build an airplane. To me... all of that looks like magic. Come on. What? Get on. It's OK. Sit on it. I can't ride, I said! Don't hold so tight. And when you fly, read the wind, and go... Look ahead. Ready? Hold the handlebars straight. I can't! Yes, you can. You OK? Again. Don't let go! OK. Here goes. Take it slow. Keep your feet up. Keep it straight. OK? Good. OK? Yeah. Now pedal. Don't let go! Make sure you hang on! Kiki! Brake! Liar! Great! You rode it! There! You see? Wow! I'm riding a bike! Now you'll never forget how. Yeah? You'll fly again. So... don't quit. Here is the weather. Powerful winds known as the 'sea monster' could strike Koriko. Be very careful, everybody. Kiki? Kiki? The Zookeeper needs something delivered right away. I can't do that, Osono. If you can't fly, you can still walk, can't you? Are you really going to quit? I won't stop you... if you've made up your mind. But at least stick it out until the very end. People are depending on you. This is from my husband. Magic to make you feel better. Away you go. The Zookeeper is frantic. It's good. I'll see you later, Jiji. Fly! You know you can! Fly! Fly! What are you doing? Flying! A curse! There's a curse coming! Go get Tombo! OK! Kiki! Get on! No! She needs to get to Dr Ishi! Yes, I know that! Someone's got to go! Yes, of course. But still... I'll take Maruko to the vet. But you can't sail to Iina Island in this storm. They found the vet. Do you want her to die? No! That's why I've called the delivery service. They want me to deliver Maruko? There you are! I need something delivered. What do you want? Go away! Hey! I called her here. Don't talk like that! Is Maruko that bad? Yes! What about your medicine? Medicine doesn't work! She won't eat! Nothing works! Why? You cursed her! That's a lie! Kiki's not a bad witch, and her only magic is flying! She's got you in her power? Let's ask her. You can take anything anywhere faster than anyone, right? We have to hurry before Dr Ishi goes off again! But she can't fly. What? Hey, Witch! People are saying you can't fly. You can't? But... So send me to Iina Island. No! I can't let you do that in wind like this! Aw, man! Nazuru! I'll take her! I'll take her. What? You can't fly. And your broom's not powerful enough. The power's not in my broom, it's in me! Right! Take Maruko to Iina Island for us. Mr Zookeeper... Get ready. Get her ready! Atchi! Morio! Leave this to me. Here, Maruko! I'll take you. She won't come to a witch. Quiet! Why not? You saw her. Stop it! Maruko! Are you going to stay there with your mom forever? There you go. Thank you. Secure the bottom. Don't worry, Maruko. I'll get you there. Tie that. So fly, then! Fly! Nazuru! Kiki! You did it! I'm flying! Get him to Dr Ishi! Iina Island? Yes! Iina... Which way is that? You go straight east from here. Here, Kiki! Is this the right way? Open your eyes, Tombo. You have to guide me to the island! I'm feeling... kind of seasick! Oh, come on! The 'Sea Monster' storm, accompanied by heavy rain... is now passing Riri Island. It is expected to reach Koriko at about 1 p.m. Be careful, everybody. Because of the storm, all boats have been cancelled. We have a phone call with a message from Koriko Zoo. This is the Koriko Zookeeper. Dr Ishi! Kiki the Witch is heading for Iina Island. That's her! Save Maruko the hippo! Hey, Witch! Don't drop her... or I'll break your broom! Nazuru! Excuse that. Go, Kiki! You'll be fine, Maruko. I know you will! Will you all stop it! Don't drop Maruko! We're counting on you, Witch! Kiki! We're too low! I know! Any higher and it sways! Come up! Tombo! We're OK, Maruko. In hopes that Maruko the hippo arrives safely at Dr Ishi's... we will now play this song of encouragement. We dedicate this song to Kiki the Witch... who is now flying Maruko through this storm. Kiki the Witch, this song is for you. Kara Takami's hit single, 'Voice'. Go, Kiki! Go! Go! Go! Kiki the Witch! Go! Kiki! That was too close! Watch out! There'll be more rocks! Kiki! Kara? What a witch feels, her broom feels too. If I can feel strong... If I can be strong... Kiki! Kiki! Tombo! Look! Well, well, well! There's hippos out here? Dr Ishi? You know who I am? What happened to her tail? A lion bit it. That wouldn't taste good. There, there... Hang on. This should work. Let's see... Or maybe this. And then... this. That should do it. It's cute. There, there... There! Now walk. Is she better? It's a kind of prosthesis. Like false teeth. So what did she have? A kind of disorientation. 'Disorientation'? It's serious. You lose the center between your body and soul. In extreme cases, you don't know who you are any more. Just from a bite on the tail? Don't sell tails short. A tail can be proof you're alive. 'Proof you're alive'... She has her center back. Traveling with you, she found herself again. She'll be fine now. Good hippo. Kiki, do you remember the first time you flew? Of course. That's when I decided to become a witch. Is that her? It's Kiki! Kiki! Kiki! Welcome home! We're back, everyone! Welcome home! Welcome back! We're back! I'm so glad I came here!
