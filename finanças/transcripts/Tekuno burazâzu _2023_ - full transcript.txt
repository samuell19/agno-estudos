Foolish Piggies Films Executive Producers Hirobumi Watanabe Yuji Watanabe A Hirobumi Watanabe Film How do you like it, Boss? The boss says it stinks. Stinks...? Yes, it stinks. According to the boss. Excuse me, Boss Riko. Can you tell me why you think the Techno Brothers stink? The boss says, Figure it out for yourself! I'm sorry, ma'am. They would like your advice. The boss says, Since you insist... First off, it's not fit for the modern age, and the public won't understand it. Learn to read the times. Think about what the public wants. But that music won't fly here. Wait, please! The boss says, Maybe you can make it in Tokyo. Tokyo? She says, Yes. Tokyo. Go to the city. Get a contract with a big record company. Promote your sound globally, make a name for yourself. And make a lot of money. That's what she says. Boss, it's time to go. The greatest musicians of our time, yes. Geniuses on a par with Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, the Beatles, Miles Davis, Bob Dylan! And they're brothers! The band name? It's Techno Brothers! Boss Riko, They say we have to audition in Tokyo if we want a contract. The boss says, Great! Off you go, then. Hey! The boss says, Are you going on foot? Actually, I have to admit we don't have enough money for tickets. Could you possibly spot us some cash? The boss says, No way. You're musicians. Make your own money. Try busking or the internet. I'll give you a lift to town, but then you're on your own. Thank you very much. The boss says, Good luck. Break a leg. Why do you people make so little money? Have you tried to help me in any way? If you feel any sympathy for me, you would try to earn a few yen! We're really in trouble. We've gotta scrimp 'til we get to Tokyo. Hello. What would you like to order? - One Italian seafood tomato stew. - OK. - And one meta e meta pizza. - Right. - One quiche. - Uh huh. - One arancini. - Yes. - One margherita pizza. - Yes. - That's it for now. - What would you like to drink? - Orange juice, please. - Yes. - Any drinks for your companions? - They'll just have tap water. Got it. Coming right up. What's with the long faces? If you have something to say, say it. Come on. Why are you so crass? You're bugging me. Get out. Wake up. - I hired a driver. - I'm Takano. Nice to meet you. He'll drive us to Tokyo. - Let's go. - Yessir. - I filled it up. - Thank you. - Where to? - I just found good news inside. Let's go. - Thank you. - Thank you. What're you doing? Move your butts. Let's go. The prize is 30,000 yen?! What a great start! Winning a contest in the boonies is a cinch for the Techno Brothers. After we win, let's all have a feast tonight. What do you guys wanna eat? Sushi, yakiniku, ramen, Chinese, French, Italian Whatever you like. Oh, I can't wait! We can binge out. Hello, everyone. This marks our 60th anniversary.

And above all, for underwriting the costs, including the prize money, thanks goes to me. Please show us the fruits of your efforts since last year, and good luck winning the 30,000 yen prize!

Mr. Haruhito Akabane. Congratulations!! Here's your prize money, 30,000 yen. - Congratulations. - Thank you very much. Haruhito, how will you spend your prize money? I'll buy a fridge full of ice cream. That's a lot of ice cream. That concludes the music festival. Thank you all very much! Thank you very much. Thank you very much. D'ya have any good excuses? Brace yourselves. You're in worse shape than ever. If man does not work, he shall not eat. Heard that before? If you don't work and you're hungry, you can find your own food! What are they doing? What d'you want? Hmm... Not bad, for you guys. Hey - What? You're the musicians from yesterday! You spent the night here? We're used to staying in places like this. Hey, your music was pretty good. But a little weird. Thank you, I think. - So where are you guys heading? - Tokyo. Tokyo? That's a long way to go. To promote the Techno Brothers' music to the world. Ah, I see. In that case, I'll give you this. - What is it? - It's a good luck charm, of course. - It's creepy. Yuck. We don't need it. - What? Don't be that way. We met yesterday, so it's not like we're strangers. Just take it, don't be afraid. Good luck! What's that? Freaky, isn't it? But I can't throw it away. I don't want it to bring bad luck. I have to take the car in for repairs. That's a pain. Anyhow we've gotta get to town... Wake up. Your turn. It can't be fixed right away. We need to order some parts. - How soon can you fix it? - I'll try to have it in the morning. We're counting on you. You can stay at the inn in town for the night. - Welcome to our hotel. - Three rooms, please. - Do you have a reservation? - Not yet. I see. What type of rooms would you like? A royal suite for me and two single rooms for them. I see, ma'am. Please fill out this form. You guys do whatever you want. - Good morning. - Hi, I fixed it as soon as I could. - I knew I could trust you. - Come by anytime you need me. Thank you. By the way, that guy doesn't look so good. Is he OK? He's fine. Don't worry. Mr. Takano. I need you to make a stop. It's not far from here. What's that noise? Are you hungry? Be a man. You're so pathetic. I guess I'll get you something to eat. Here's your food. Here. Here. Here. Your food. Eat it. Here. What's with him? Is he dead? What're you doing in front of my office? - You're so noisy. Can you wait over there? - Wait a sec! - No I won't wait. C'mon! - No! Lemme go! The patient's heart has stopped beating. I pronounce 18:26 as the time of death. The cause of death is extreme starvation and stress. I'm sorry for your loss. Take care. There's no time for sentimentality. A human being is just a collection of cells. Remember that. We're head to Tokyo as soon as this is done. We don't have a second to dally. Thank you for waiting. Here are the funeral plans. - Excuse me. - Huh... - How can you charge this much? - I believe our pricing is quite standard. Standard? This price level? It's not worth discussing. - Can I have a word? - What is it? - I'd like you to burn some garbage. - Garbage? It's a pretty big piece of garbage. I don't think so. Take it to the waste center. I'll make it a little easier for you. That'll do. Hey, guys. - It's pretty big. - We had a deal. Death is not an eternal end. Death is not an eternal separation. This is not a sad parting, but rather a blessing. His body will become earth, wind, water, river and will be with us forever. He will live on! Our brother, who loved music and loved techno, be as thou wilt be forever, be the flow of this river. As a flower in a storm. Life is only goodbyes. Mr. Kurosaki... Mr. Kurosaki! It's crazy - there's a woman with a huge dog. What's with that brute? It's enormous! Like 3 meters long. Look at this! That can't be safe. Whoa. You're still working on that? Please write more quickly, Mr. Kurosaki. It'll be dark soon. I'm always the one who gets blamed. Please keep writing. Move quickly! You're always so slow. I mean, you don't work at all. What's your hourly pay? - 900 yen. - 900 yen? That's much more than me. You're joking, right? What's going on here?! I'm gonna sue the owner! - Hi, how are you? - Hi... We'd like to play tonight. - Are you a musician? - No, I'm Himuro, the manager. - Who would play? - Them. Weird. Do they have a name? - The Techno Brothers. - Techno Brothers? Never heard of them. - What kind of music do they play? - Techno. What's techno? You work here but you don't know what techno is? - Is techno cool? - Give it a listen and you'll see. - Mr. Kurosaki, do you know what techno is? - I don't. Mr. Kurosaki!! You don't know and they're paying you? How can you drag your feet like that? It's a big venue! It's a little bit shabby, but we can get about 500 people in here. - How many people usually come? - Customers? - Well, I haven't seen a customer in years. - That's pathetic. Why don't you make a little effort? Effort? Hahaha... I haven't heard that word in a while. My middle school teacher used to tell me that. People who don't make an effort will fail. They'll waste their lives and never realize how stupid they are. - I just remembered that. - That's you to a tee. Huh? Enough of this. Talking to you will drive me crazy. Huh?! What d'you mean by that? Ms. Himuro, Ms. Himuro? Mr. Kurosaki, is it done yet? You have 'til the end of the day. Do it fast, but do it right! Ms. Himuro, here's your fee for today. So, where are you guys headed next? Tokyo, to sign with a record company. Wow, Tokyo. Impressive! So it's not just a dream to be on Friday Night Live! No interest in that. Huh? Then the Record Awards? Or maybe the Kohaku Uta Gassen? You're kidding. Oh! Are you going for the Grammys? I'm sorry, but that's not my goal. What? Got it! The Japan Amateur Singing Contest. Or... Lemme see... The King of Singers on TV Tochigi? But you'd have to sing for that one. So it must be the Japan Record Awards... Oh, Kohaku Uta Gassen, after all, eh? - I never get bored talking with you. - Huh? - Welcome. - Welcome! Welcome. Are you ready to order? One Roasted Pork Wonton Noodle, extra large. That's all. - And for you? - Just tap water is fine. Thank you. Coming right up. What's with that look? You got a problem with me? Hello? Hi. Yes... Yes. I understand... OK... See you tonight. We just got a gig for tonight. Get ready. Techno Brothers. - It's a great orchid farm. - Isn't it? - This is cymbidium, isn't it? - How'd you know that? - My sister used to love these flowers. - Your sister? - So how can we help you? - I'd like you to play music for them. - For the flowers? - Yeah. - Techno? - That's right. I'm trying to see how orchids respond to music. So I'm running some experiments. That's an interesting idea. I like your spirit of exploration. OK. Well, give it your best shot. I'll pay you well. Thank you. Great music. That's more than we expected. Take it. I got to hear some interesting music. Besides, I like crazy people like you. You know... Those sensible, decent people... I don't trust them. - That's a good point. - Sure is. I hope the crazy flowers bloom. Good luck! Welcome. Welcome. What can I get for you? One orange juice, with strawberry shortcake, cheesecake, chocolate cake, - and one Mont Blanc, please. - Certainly, ma'am. Hello, it's me. Yes... Did you find my sister? I see... She's like a kite with no string. We need to find my sister. Keep looking for her. I'll be in touch. Thank you for waiting. Here's your juice. Thank you. - Who has the strawberry shortcake? - That's me. - And the cheesecake? - That's me. - And chocolate cake? - That's me. They're all me. - Is that all? - Hang on. I'll have one of the cream puffs, and the special tart with pears and Cheyenne muscat. - Oh. And some tap water for these two. - Yes, ma'am. Why are you looking at me like that? You act like it's my fault that your friend died. They're like pimply teen rebels. I'll have to give them proper training. Are you OK? Have some if you want. Thank you very much. - Hello. - Hi, welcome. - We'd like to play today. - Are you musicians? I'm Himuro, the manager. The musicians are the Techno Brothers. Techno Brothers? Never heard of them. They're right there. They look kind of odd. They can play tonight. Thank you. Here's your share. - Thank you. - Sure. - Can I ask one question? - Sure. Why do you manage the Techno Brothers? Aren't there more bankable musicians out there? - Because I believe in their potential. - Potential? I know they're going to be successful. Some day, the whole world will know them. - Is that a joke? - I never joke. Well, that's quite a feat for such a young person. Where's the washroom? Go that way. It's at the end of the hall on the right. Thanks. Excuse me. - Huh? Where are the Techno Brothers? - They just left. They grabbed the envelope right there. What the feck... Damn you! Aww... Shit! I'm screwed. So screwed... I can't fecking believe it. Where the hell did they go? Idiots, assholes, brainless- So annoying. Such a pain.. Yes, hello? This is Himuro... Hi, sir! We're on the way to Tokyo, but we ran into some trouble... Of course I'm totally motivated! By the end of the day? Well, I'll try, but it might be difficult... Yes... Hmm. It is... Yes... Oh, no! Please don't say that! Please, just this once, give us a chance! We'll do anything you ask. One last chance! Be merciful! Sir? Hello? Sir? Mr. President? Oh, no... Bastards! Thank you for waiting. Roasted pork wonton noodles. Enjoy. It's totally fine for you to stay. Is 5,000 yen a night OK? Do you know those guys? You've gotta be kidding. They ate and ran! You need to pay for their ramen, gyoza and beer. All of it. Now! Nice place. Ah, finally dumped. It's been 3 days. Ah... So constipated... What a relief. Huh? - Weren't you at the riverbank the other day? - What are you doing here? Well, this is my backyard, and that's my latrine. Disgusting! What a coincidence to run into each other again. Maybe we're destined to be together. Don't be creepy. You make my skin crawl. By the way, what happened to the other three guys? - I'm trying to track them down. One's dead. - Dead? You're kidding. So you killed him, huh? Nothing good's happened since I met you. You're like a bad-luck charm. That's funny, I gave you a good luck charm. It should've worked. Drop it, I'm busy. Hey, wait. You know... I found this in the trash the other day. Here, you can have it. Gross... Looks like your shit's smeared on it. You guys are musicians, why don't you try out? I heard they're holding auditions. I need to find the Techno Brothers first. Well, I don't know about that, but good luck. I hope our paths cross again sometime. See you. Bye. Guys. I finally found you. You blew our contract. You get it, right? Don't even dream about escaping. You ungrateful bastards. It's like being bit by a trusted dog. Are you listening? You're gonna regret what you did. I've got you on a short leash until you die. Hello. I'm calling about the Halloween party entertainers. I have the perfect entertainers. Kids just love them. Yes, I understand. We'll come tomorrow. And about the fee... Thank you for playing. We'll talk it over and let you know later. Please wait outside for a bit. Thank you very much. What do you think? I don't understand this music. I don't get it at all. They're the Techno Brothers. So they're brothers? They don't look like brothers. With the sunglasses, I can't tell. Should we say yes? Well, we don't understand them. But there's no reason they can't be in the festival. - I agree with you. - Me too. Well, then. ...reflecting on the new world of the future... ...reflecting on the new world of the future... Just to go there... I wanted to hear the happy bells, at least... You, you're the best... It's heartrending to sing this song... I'll sing with all my heart... Ta... ta... ta... ta... ta... Otawara, Otawara, Otawara, Otawara... Hello, Himuro here. We ran into a bit of trouble. So we'll be late getting to Tokyo. That's right. Oh, good job... - Here you are... Enjoy! - Thank you. - If you take this... - Yes. OK... - Is it OK to come later? - Please drop by then. - Here... Thanks... - Thank you! Welcome. Welcome! - We have popcorn! - Try your luck! Come and look... The greatest musicians of our time. Genius comparable to Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Miles Davis and the Beatles! Brothers, yes. Their name? The Techno Brothers! I see, you lost one of the Brothers. We won't punish you for that right now. Some sacrifices are unavoidable to achieve our goals. As you know, the situation is more serious than we foresaw. By the way, we almost caught your sister in Kyushu. But she dropped out of sight again. I think it's time you give up on her. Understood. We'll be in touch. Take care of the Techno Brothers. ©Foolish Piggies Films English Subtitles by KiSMet Productions
