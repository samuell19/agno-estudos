Subtitles by explosiveskull If you have my money, I have your Judas. His name is Oleg. Yes, my friend, the CIA. Good job. You should've told me you were running a secondary op. The risk was worth it. Besides, I knew you could handle it. Like I know you can handle a follow-up action. I thought ExSo was cutting me loose. They are, but FullSpec have agreed to bond you out. Come on. We just received actionable intel that a tier-one target is in London. We want him off the table. Leigh said this flight would be full of fucking reprobates and degenerates, but I didn't believe her until I saw your sorry ass. - How the fuck are you, Jackie? - Jesus. Mike. What the hell are you doing here? I thought you retired. Retire? Shit. I can't retire. I've got three ex-wives. Anyway. You look like shit, but you know that. Still freebasing go-pills? If you guys are done bonding, we're on a clock. Intel says we have exactly twelve hours to hit the target. I work alone. You know that. - No offense, old man. - Yeah, okay. Look. This is not some third-rate Haji we're going after, OK? This is a bad guy. Top of the President's kill list. Brennan will be point, but it's my op. Collins, I worked my ass off to get you cleared. Why's that? EXSo afraid they got another nut-job on their hands? You know. Just... This is a FullSpec op. Oh... That other morally considerate employer. I hear they got their plausible deniability sewn up tighter than a camel's asshole. If you don't want to go home, London is what I got. I need you. Prepare to take off. Be a team player. I got your back, Mike. Always. Yo! Are you people deaf? Pilot said sit down, strap in already. I'm trying to scalp this motherfucker by tonight. Jackie Collins, Pete Samuelson. Pete, Jackie. Pete and I did Libya together. He was a prick then. He's a prick now. But he's a damn fine operator. Well, the old man's wrong. I'm even better than that. I'm fact, I'm the best. Are you fucking kidding me? What the hell is Collins doing here? What are you talking about? What am I talking about? Jesus Christ, Leigh. I'm talking about a messed-up war junkie who won't go home, because you people won't let him. I need Collins in this fight. And so do you, Brennan. I thought you were friends. No, we are friends, and as his friend, I'm asking you. Do the guy a solid. Cut him loose. Send him home. His wife just gave birth to a kid he hasn't even laid eyes on, for Christ's sake. We've all made sacrifices. He can handle it. Sure, 'til he blows up in your face, and then, that shit's on you, honey. Uh-oh. Where's the first half of my money? Check it again. A million fucking bucks, just like that. I love Terror Tuesdays. No more Terror Tuesdays. Now it's terror all day, every day. But screw up, and you get nothing but a Title Fifty disavow. Oh, I haven't missed a shot my whole life. And landing in some prison cell is not in my game plan. So, then, who's the lucky son of a bitch who tops the President's kill list? Terry McKnight. He was a deep cover operative, based in Pakistan. He became a Muslim to better understand his enemy. Or so he claimed. Then the ISI dug their claws into him. Turned him. For three years, he fed them our intel. They gave that intel to the Taliban. Got a lot of our guys killed. Haji hunter by day, personal crusader by night, shit. We're never gonna win this war. What about the man's due process? He gave up his rights as an American when he became a terrorist. Fuck his due process. Oh, um, I'm sorry, did I just... interrupt? It's a good story, spook. It is. But I heard something different. I heard you guys fucked him when his cover was blown. Straight up disavow. Are you done? McKnight's there to do a deal with a group of Russian ex-FSB officers. What the deal's for, we don't know, but we know he's working with this man, Farooq Hassan. Hassan's a Syrian national. He moves intel, guns, people, but he's not ideological. He's strictly about the money. He's not the only one. Private sector intelligence provides him legitimate cover. These are his known associates. This is where you start. Wait. Go back one. There. Tony Deighton. So, kill the suspense, already. Saved his ass in Afghanistan a couple of years ago. - That was good of you. - Yeah, he thought so, too. IED almost blew him in half. Look, this guy's a buddy of yours, and it turns out he's a bad guy, maybe you should sit this one out there, Jackie boy. We were tight back then. He's my brother. Like you, Mike. He's a good operator. No way he's involved in this shit. But greed. Greed is bad for business. Mr. McKnight... You should've taken the CIA's advice and used encryption. Please. I never meet... CIA, I just... - do it through phone... - Don't you beg. Now, give me a name. Before 20 men enter your house and... violate your children. While your wife drowns in their semen. Leigh. Leigh. Please! It's clean. Deighton, how you doing, man? It's Jack Collins. Yeah, me too, brother. Me too. Look, I need to meet. I'm on the clock and I need a favor. I appreciate it. All right, I'll see you there. So, Jackie, how's the family? When's the last time you were Stateside? Hey, Mike, go fuck yourself, OK? Look, You're gonna pledge your allegiance to that girl? To the CIA, to a system that doesn't give a rat's dick about you? Fuck loyalty. Go home, Jack. Meet your kid. Huh? Be a father. You're father of the year now, Mike? Hell no. I'm a three-time loser who should've been home for his kids. Instead, I've gotta keep taking out bad guys, so I don't drown in goddamn alimony. Fucking witches. There's my favorite fucking cowboy! Deighton, you son of a bitch. - How you doing, man? - You're fucking looking at it, mate. Never better. You? Good, man. I'm good. Yeah. This is Mike Brennan and Pete Samuelson. Tony Deighton. - Nice to meet you, man. - Nice to meet you. I thought you said this guy was the shit. He don't look like much. You don't look like much. This prick Delta? Come on, grab a seat. Alan. So... the CIA still reckons it can win the war on terror by outsourcing it to fucking cowboys? I call that desperation. It's pretty fucking tragic. But you look like you do OK for yourself. I do all right. War machine provides. That's the beauty of our capitalist system. That and we're all brothers together. Right? Well, it's not like we can quit. We miss the action too much, that's our trouble. How's the family? Ah, you know. Working on it. Jesus. Yours? Joanne sacked me off for some fucking hairdresser, if you can believe that shit. Lisa's shagging anything that moves just to spite her old man. She's 16 fucking years old. All good, really. Poor bastard. Fuck, it's good to see you, man. You too, man. You too. It's like old times, huh? Just glad to see you're still in the fight. To bounty hunters. Who's a bounty hunter? I'm a shadow warrior. You're a fucking what? Jesus. Right, what do you need? Our intel says he worked with you guys in Syria back, uh, back when "6" ran him. Yeah, sure. Farooq Hassan. He's a good bloke. You guys tight? I helped him set up here. So, question is, what do you lot want with him? He running some international terrorist organization I don't know about? You're funny. It is so in your interest to cooperate with us. Deighton. We just wanna talk to the guy, no big deal. Come on, D, it's for me. Yeah, sure, and I'd say "no problem, mate," if it was just you asking and not three bounty hunters. 'Scuse me, shadow warriors. Know what I mean? Farooq's my brother. Like you. Look, we're not here to scalp the guy, all right? And I don't wanna get into details, but our action does not conflict with your interests. You have my word. And we can also pay you for any information he provides. All right. Langley wants an update. Fucking asshole O'Neil's on the warpath. Said you'd better not fuck this up. - Here's that intel you wanted. - Thanks. Shoot a specter gunship at night when we have the chance... Nah, Syria's fun, but nothing like the good times you and me had in Afghanistan, mate. Yeah, you never did thank me for saving your ass. You fucking prick. You ran over a fucking IED. Yeah, whatever, man. You were crying like a little bitch when I pulled you out of that thing. I miss it, though, you know? Fighting the Tali, getting in close and fucking doing the bloke. Sticking that knife in deep, twisting it, seeing the poor Haji's lights go out. Tali were some fierce fucking hombres, man. Yeah, we took a giant shit in their backyard, What d'you expect? Almost there, mate. All right, just round this next bend. Hassan's gonna meet us there. Argh! What the fuck? Samuelson, quit fucking around. Grab the M4s. Don't fucking shoot him. We need him alive. We gotta catch the prick first. Slow down. It's a fucking ambush. Take the shot. Terry McKnight says hello. Collins! He's dead! What are you doing? Move! Move! Move! Move! What's done is done. Brennan's death changes nothing. We still have a job to do. You need to cut Samuelson loose before he gets killed. Are you fucking kidding me? I need to go at this alone. It was me who saved you, dumbass. He's baggage I don't need. And he's a fucking liability. You took one too many go-pills. Brennan's death is on you. Oh, you want to go, motherfucker? All right, knock it off. Find a way to work together or you're done. Both of you. And you're on the next flight home. I need you to draw Deighton out, extract him and bring him here. Keith and Dave will assist. Look, Leigh. If we track Deighton, we've got a better chance at locating McKnight than ambushing. What, you want to drive around all night? We need to fight smart. Collins, no one doubts your commitment, OK? We're all upset about Brennan. Just take a minute. And then tell me your head is still in the game. You'll take command on the ground. Roger that. What happens to Brennan's share? What the fuck is wrong with you? Fucking cocksucker! Goddammit, enough! If either one of you jeopardizes my operation, it'll be the last thing you ever do. Now, go! - Deighton, let me explain... - Shut the fuck up. Now I gotta throw bodies at this. You ever fuck up an ambush again, I will fucking shoot you. You understand? This ends before it begins. I'm fucking on it, boss. All right. Hassan. You're blown, mate. Take off. Roger that. D, are we really gonna go to war with the fucking CIA? Just concentrate on protecting our investment. I'll take care of the rest. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're on the move. You were right, the CIA sent a bunch of county hunters to take you out. We clipped the team leader. One of them is an old friend of yours, I believe. Saved your life in, uh, Afghanistan or something like that? Yeah, Collins. Ex-SEAL. Almost on my level. Almost. Those SEALs are as good as it gets, Deighton. Terry. Your security is paramount to me. I'm taking you to the boat. Ivan here'll take care of you now. Is that really how you wanna run your opsec? I keep you moving, Terry. I keep you alive. Besides we're done here, right? There's no more chatter. You stay where you are. Listen, Anthony... Bloke who gave me this, he got introduced to the way of the knife. Him and his whole fucking family. You're fine. Just don't get sentimental on me, Deighton. Not with the money I'm paying you. Oh, I'll put Collins down, don't you worry about that. Let's just not give him the opportunity to put you down, Terry. Not before the account's been settled. So this friend of yours, Collins, he say anything about his handler? No. Something I should know? Terry? This is where you learn to trust me. You know what the Russians say about trust? "Trust in God, and mind your own fucking business." Her name is Leigh Allen and she's a true believer. You could say I'm her special project. Blames me for killing her father when he and I were stationed in South Waziristan together. Did you? She believes it. The reality is... more complicated. Like Waziristan itself, you... know less when you leave, than you do when you arrive. So? So, she's a very confused and angry young woman. And angry and confused young women do stupid things. Not stupid. Dangerous. And she's got an endless black budget to do them with. Jackie, you're upset about Brennan. I understand. It's tough losing a bloke like that. And, you know, I'd be a liar if I said I didn't enjoy it. But it's not personal. Right? It's not personal, it's just business. What part of murdering my friend isn't personal? You know how this is gonna end, right? Yeah, I reckon I do. I've gotta put you down, D. Listen, do you really want your kid to grow up without his dad, Jackie? I'm offering you an out, mate. Go home, go home now. You've given enough to the cause. You're over-reaching. Fine, this time, I'm not going to save you. I'm gonna bury you. Why'd you turn, man? It can't just be about the money. Can't it? You think you're not expendable? Tell you what, you try telling the Afghan story to your handler. See how she reacts. Because when the ends justify the means, the CIA will dump you in a fucking heartbeat to get what it wants. One, two, tree. Let's hope Leigh disabled the alarm. It's multi-locked. Step aside. D, the Yanks just broke into our office. All right. Let's go earn some money. Take a go-pill. Let's go. Right, we're almost there. I don't want any fireworks outside my office, understood? What the hell are you doing? Fun's not done yet, fucknuts. Fucksake! What the fuck? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Fucking Yanks. Always got to blow shit up. Paul? You and Janusz wait here for the police, fire service, to show up. Handle it. Roger that. Let's go. Jackie, Jackie, Jackie. Should of taken the out, my friend. All right, I've got their phone. They're headed East. Your boyfriend took the bait. You're welcome. Deighton's on his way. Where's the kill zone? A disused factory. My guys will rendezvous with you there. Sending location now. There are two ways into the factory. Here and here. Once Deighton's inside, Leigh will paint the target and we'll pull him into the ambush, here for the extract. Better hope her guys are up to the task. We have to separate Deighton to extract him. He's going to be throwing bodies at this. They're leading us to a disused factory, D. Oh, how lovely. Got to love a CIA kill site. Guess they're serious about dying. So, call in the reinforcements. Night vision coming online. What the hell? We're not going to need tracking devices. So, what's the plan? The plan? The plan is for you to shut the fuck up and listen. That's the fucking plan. So keep your shit wired tight. We're expecting multiple hostiles. On three. One, two, three. Keep your spacing. Kill anything that moves. I'm seeing seven tangos. Be advised, target is painted. Heading North. Shit. No. Come on. - Draw them to the ambush. - Roger that. Remember, we have to separate Deighton. Target is 50 meters to the ambush. You two guys keep your shit together. Don't engage Deighton until he's out of the kill zone. We need him separated from his men. - Fuck! Be advised I have lost visual. - Fuck, do it! I have lost visual. The fuck are you doing? Go. You son of a bitch. On me. Move! Extract! Move! Move, motherfucker! Move! Come on, let's go! Why the fuck did you let Deighton get away? We had him. You had a job to do. You should've done it. You should have left me. Trust me, I thought about it. Fuck! On me. Where the fuck is the car? Come on, let's go. You're lucky your vest took that shot. Yeah, I feel fucking lucky. Yeah, wait, wait, wait. There's no sign of them, D. All right, get back to McKnight. Roger that. Keith. Talk to me. Give me a sitrep. Oh, Keith can't come to the phone right now on account of him being dead. KIA. This other fella here, too. Collins and Samuelson are next, Leigh. You know who this is? You're compromised, Deighton. Oh, is that right? But maybe there's an opportunity in your compromise. Do you get what I'm saying? Why don't you enlighten me, sweetheart? Men can be replaced. Opportunities cannot. This opportunity, is it mutually beneficial? Why don't we find out. The fuck is wrong with you? Let's get the fuck out of here. You all right, man? Yeah, I'm alright. I don't look alright to you? Not the first bullet I've taken. Anyway, thanks. Come on, don't leave me hanging. Come on. I lost focus back there. That's not like me. Two million ain't enough for this bullshit. I'll tell you that right now. Fuck it. Two cars are stationary. And one is moving towards the river. Son of a bitch. McKnight's holed up on a goddamn boat. Call Leigh again. We need a re-up ASAP. Hm. You were expecting someone older. Most men do. I'm not most men. Where the fuck is she? What do you think? We have a shot, if we jack the boat before Deighton shows up. Let's get on it then. Collins is finished. We both know it. If you want McKnight as much as I think you do, I'm your only option. You know... aiding a tier-one terrorist automatically puts you on the list right beside them. But, be that as it may, you were smart to call me, because I can keep you off that list. So why don't you help me decide if we can work together. What is McKnight buying from the Russians? What's the bounty on him? Let's start with a million dollars. Warhead for a tactical nuke. But that's not why you're here. You had this all planned out. Right from the start. My God... You figured you could make money from both sides, be a hero for killing McKnight, and be in line for future CIA contracts. Who's to say if you're actually helping him. You want revenge for daddy? Then I am it, sweetheart, because... I understand. I understand, it's-it's fucking, it's cold-blooded what he did. Hmm? I can imagine what that's like. McKnight beheaded my father and emailed me the video. You cannot even begin to imagine what that's like. And the CIA sanctioned this? Get me McKnight and the warhead and I'll triple whatever he's paying you. Call off your attack dogs, you've got a deal. Collins and Samuelson... are your problem. Then where are they? You gotta figure there's three guys from Deighton's group inside. At least three. Plus two or three of McKnight's bodyguards. Dude, this is gonna be brutal. A lot of ground to cover. Where the fuck is Leigh? Weapons check. I got four for the Shorty. Five for the Glock. Could be worse. I have five for the Shorty and five for the Glock. Sure you wanna do this? It's gonna be a righteous kill. Amen. Don't. Hey. Don't. Don't mock God. She doesn't like that. Let's go shoot this fucking guy. Argh! How many others on the boat? It's just us. Where's McKnight? Where is McKnight? Deighton knows you're here. How? I don't know. Please, I swear to God I don't... Let's get the fuck out of here, right now. Contact! Move! Move! We gotta get the fuck outta here. Extract. The car! The car! Mag change. Move! Move! Mag change! Move! The container. Move! The car! The car! Take the fucking car! Samuelson, move! Whoo-hoo! Come on, you fucking Delta pussy! Stop hiding, you fucking coward! Come on! Fuck it. Samuelson, what the fuck are you doing? You should've counted your rounds. Never did rate you Delta twats. I got this, Logan! Right, drop the pistol. Drop the pistol. Drop the long. Drop the fucking pistol. Drop it. Drop the long. Good. Now... Let's say we settle this the old-fashioned way. Huh? Come on. You hold that knife like a bitch. Send Brennan my regards. Samuelson's dead. Lights out. Collins? Hear me, mate? He's dead. Just you now. Just you. Deighton! He's here! Deighton, he's over here! How about you tell me what the fuck is going on, Deighton? They got lucky. It won't happen again. You got nothing to worry about. They got fucking lucky? Is that what I'm gonna tell the Russians? "They got fucking lucky!" I warned you those SEALs were good! One left, Terry. One left and he's a fucking... The exchange is blown, and so is my out! The Russians will not tolerate last minute changes. Neither will my buyers. How the fuck did they find me? Calm down. I'll get you a new exchange and an out, right. Your jihadis still get their warhead. You know why you'll always remain second-tier, Deighton? - Prejudice. - Oh. Small-minded prejudice. My buyers are not jihadis. Empires are destroyed from within. I am merely accelerating the process. All right. Don't make you any less dangerous to be around, but, like I said, you've got nothing to worry about. All right? I'll handle it. I will handle it, Terry. Yeah, you do that. This is Janusz and Paul. They'll take care of you. Janusz and Paul? Fuck. TJD Security. The best protection money can buy. Deighton. Once you've dealt with Collins, take out Leigh. Maybe... I'll double what I'm paying you. Tell you what. As a gesture of good faith, I'll do it for free. Let me know when you guys are ready. Samuelson's dead. What happened? We tracked McKnight to the river. He was holed up on a boat. It was an ambush. Somehow Deighton knew we were coming. McKnight was long gone. What happened to you? My guy, Keith, despite that cluster-fuck at the factory, somehow managed to survive. He was alive long enough for Deighton to extract everything he needed. Then Deighton breached the safe house. I had to ditch all our coms. Can you finish? Yeah, I can finish, and then I'm done. Look. If you quit, this war, it won't just end. OK? You have an obligation. I thought you were committed. Who'll protect the homeland? Are we protecting the homeland? Or are we just making more enemies? McKnight is a bad guy. And that bad guy is buying a warhead for a tactical nuke. This comes straight from Langley. After that McKnight is gone, and his threat becomes a reality. Are we gonna take him out? Most people... they don't realize the level of violence that we're capable of. Excuse me? I once slit the throats of four Afghans. There was fierce fighting in this mountain region. We found them in a cave. Three old men and one young kid. They were unarmed. Farmers... who'd got caught up in the fighting. Pretty sure they were taking turns fucking this kid. Collins... I told them if they cooperated, we'd treat them humanely. So they did. They were scared. We were cut-off from our unit, so they agreed to lead us out. Neither of us had a choice. We needed out. They didn't want the Taliban to see them helping us. For obvious reasons. But they were afraid that we'd kill them once they'd led us to safety. We promised we wouldn't. Once we'd cleared the danger, I slit their throats. I did the kid first. He looks at me. He can't believe it. I promised him. Now I'm betraying him. And all I can say is, "Sorry, kid. It's my nature." You had no way to verify if they were Taliban. You saved lives. You did what you were supposed to do. It's not a betrayal if there's a greater objective. Deighton was right. - I have given enough to the cause... - Look. The President gave us the green light. Now either we execute, or a lot of people are gonna get killed who don't need to get killed. Then let's finish this. OK. What do you guys need? I want you to hack TJD Security's servers. OK, so... all of their registered domains are down. I'm not gonna get anything here. What about Deighton's wife, his kids, his dog? We're not touching the guy's family. They're civilians. You wanna go home to your family? Find me Deighton's. If we do this, we do it my way. Understood? Search Lisa Deighton. Lisa Deighton. Take me to the hotel. All right. She's got a phone, and that phone's got a location. She's at a pub on Longcroft Road. The George and Dragon. Gear? There's a car outside. All right. This is what I want you to do. Fuck. Right, we've got him. Let's go get paid. Get set. Roger that. How we doing? All quiet on the Western front, boss. That's what they said the night before 9/11. It ain't over till it's over. Stay alert. Take five. I got this. Take him down. Fuck. Take me to the warehouse. - Let's go! - Just fucking shoot me! You got a family. - Deighton? - Collins is being put down as we speak. I'm on my way to the warehouse to kill McKnight and get your warhead. Get my money ready. I'll see you there. Bastard. Fucking bastard. So... How much is Leigh paying Deighton? How much? If I knew that, I'd be running the fucking show. Deighton's gonna fuckin' tear you apart. Man, all I wanna do is go home. We're inside. What happened? Collins? Did you get him? Hello, Leigh. Long time no speak. I want Deighton to hear this, too. You're gonna die tired, you son of a bitch. Deighton? Yeah, I'm here, Terry. You two are gonna make a beautiful couple. You made the wrong play, my friend. You got greedy. What do you think is gonna happen when Leigh goes before her bosses and explains how she failed to eliminate me after they foolishly sanctioned her personal vendetta? She'll throw you under a bus before she pays you, so why don't you do what you so kindly offered to do before and pop the bitch. It's the only way you're gonna get out of this. So long, Deighton. Think it through before you make a move. We can still take him. There's still time. Get me McKnight's exfil. Right now. Uh-huh. Understood. I'll call you back. Now you are going to tell me how McKnight is going to exfil. - Understood? - I don't know what you're talking about. Then you find yourself in a very unfortunate position, my friend. Wait... Wait, wait! I can find him! I can find him, OK? So find him. - Deighton, listen to me. We can still... - Shut up. Talk to me. All right. Good work. Ethan. Drop the gun. Do it now! That's it. Drop the gun. Good boy. See, that is why you never trust a woman. It's all right, sweetheart. I have twice the motivation to drop McKnight. He's headed for Gridstone Airfield. Let's go. Deighton, I'm sorry. - Drop your fucking weapon. - You fucking drop it! Drop your fucking weapon! Drop it! Deighton, wait, no... Lights out. Jack. - Collins. - Don't... say a fucking word. Where's the plane? It's coming. 20 minutes. Best I could do for short notice. Goddammit. Can wait in there. All right. Let's go. Come on. We're taking McKnight's plane home. Let your people know. The money, I... I don't want your fucking money. Do you know why I'm doing this? - McKnight... - Wait for my call. He's here! Jesus Christ. Go! Go! Go! Cover me! The fuck you waiting for? Go! - Can you see him? - He's out there, keep looking. Where the fuck is he, huh? Son of a bitch. Argh! McKnight! Jack. Did you get him? All right, let's go. Subtitles by explosiveskull
