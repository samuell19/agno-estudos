There you go. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Let's go to the next house. - Let's go to the next block. - Major bummer. - Told you they never do, not even gum. - Shut up. - I hate to bother you, Dr. Rainer. But we have a situation, Doctor, if you could just come with me. - Right. - Sheriff Rivers, Mitch, says to say that you owe him one. - Heat's a killer, huh, Doc? My grandmother, she hated Indian summer. Her tribe believed that a man's shadow would come alive and wrestle with his soul. She used to say that no one was safe until the first snow. Pretty weird, huh? - Mitch finally made sheriff, huh? - Yep. - Hot enough for you, Jake? I just want you to take a look at something. Meet the Wardens. Fred Warden, president, Warden Properties Group, 500 thou a year. Darla Warden, bought things for a living. Many many things. Somebody had quite a ball in here. - So? I'm not interested. - Not yet you're not. They have an 18-year-old daughter, Sylvie, or had. No sign of her yet. And a nine-year-old son by the name of Tim. He's why you're here. - That a boy, that's good. Just relax there, Tim, no one's gonna hurt you. I just want you to give me that knife. I'm gonna come over there real slow. I just want you to give me the knife, all right, Tim. Okay. - Well that's not gonna work, he' autistic. - Mm-hmm. - I'm retired. - Quit, you mean. Restraints, huh? I know, but he's armed. - Hey, hey! Hey. All right, hey, Tim. You are the next contestant on I Want That Knife. Now, let's just see if you understand the rules, okay? Excuse me, is Sheriff Rivers in here? - Shh. - Tattoo, you wanna tell him the rules? The rules, Boss, the rules, what rules? Tattoo, remember the rack. Oh, yes, yes, the rules. All right, it's too late for the rules. It's time to introduce our new challenger, Bruce. Why don't you tell us something about yourself, Bruce? - Well, uh, I love underwater ballet, and I love voging and tennis and old Ethel Merman records. - What is this bullshit? - Sh, sh. - And I love my great big rottweiler, Rodney. And I love the movie Spartacus. Bruce, would you like to meet Tim? Tim, Bruce. Bruce, Tim. Oh ho ho. That's a hell of a knife you got there. We've got a drawer full of playing cards somewhere around here, find them. That's a very cunning outfit, if I may so so. - Go look for some cards. - Now, would you like to start playing the game? Tim, why don't you go first? Okay, ladies and gentlemen, the fabulous, the wonderful, the beautiful, Tim. All right, he's a little shy. Let's give him a round of applause, come on. Let's give him a round of applause, there you go. There you go, okay. Do we have an attitude problem? Come on, dude, come here, come here. Gag me with a spoon, come on, let's go, let's go. Mm-mm. - Jake? - Yo. Okay. Now, this is the story of this queen and these four jacks. Now, she would hide her jacks all throughout the kingdom. And the king went away. Campaigning, pillaging, plundering. And then the queen would call her jacks up to her bed chamber. Now. You give me that knife, and I'll give you this deck of cards. That's all you gotta do to win. It's okay, kid. You're safe now. - Timmy, Tim, Timmy. Timmy. Oh Timmy. - Hey, babe, look what I got. - Awwwwwww. Awwwwww. - He likes the spinning. Thank you. I'd been at the mall. When I got back, Tim was standing in front of my parents' door. The way he was rocking, I shoulda known something was wrong. I ran in, there was blood everywhere. He just kept stabbing them. - Who, Sylvie? - I don't know. He was turned away from me, leaning over the bed. I didn't think, I just jumped on his back. I remember the knife coming out of his hands. The way it fell, so slow. And then he slammed me against the wall. That's all I remember. - Did you see his face? - No. - Did you recognize him? Do you have any idea who he was? - I got a dress. - Beg your pardon. - At the mall. I got a new dress. - It's the maid's day off. Gardener's in town buying plants. Coroner says it's not the boy, he's too short, too weak, the angle of the blade's all wrong. Besides, he's doing one hell of an imitation of a garden salad inside, just about now, huh? Wouldn't give up my day job. - Yeah. Hey, maybe it was the sister. She whacks herself on the head, drags herself in the closet, passes out from loss of blood, hmm? I saw Rain Man, Jake. That little boy has got a picture of the guy all locked up in his tiny little brain. I have an eyewitness, the only problem is, he's not talking. - Got any threes? - Go fish. - Got any sixes? Hmm. I wouldn't count too much on that kid. - It's not the kid I'm counting on, Jake. Okay. I'll take a look at him, but you call in Harlinger. - Hi. Hmm. Come on, kid, you're hurting my feelings. What are you seeing in there? - Clearly catatonic. Probably a result of the extreme shock. Primitive attempts to force or cajole him out may lead to disaster. Any of Dr. Rainer's shenanigans will simply send him deeper into withdrawal. - Shenanigans? Perhaps permanently. - What shenanigans? This should draw him out, quite effectively. - I'll be going now. - We'll find out what you have hiding in there. - Hey! I'll send you the bill. - What about the girl, Jake? She's young, they need help. - Well I think Rene Harlinger knows exactly-- - Screw Harlinger, they need you. - So, so what do you think, Counselor? You think I should just walk up to this kid and say, who hacked up your parents? Hmm? This kid doesn't speak on a good day. And he's just been through a real, a real trauma, you know. And the memory of it is gonna be buried very deep. You push this kid too much and he'll shatter. - All right, you won't take the case, fine. But don't bullshit yourself, Rainer. It's not the boy you're protecting. So what do you think, Chief, robbery gone wrong? - Cash left in the house, jewels. Guy comes in, takes out the parents, lets the boy and girl live? Nah. Something else. Aw, man. Old Apache proverb, watched pots never boil. - Ha ha. Take care of the kids? - Yeah, mother was an orphan, father had an uncle in Madrid and a sister in Memphis. Both were pretty jumpy about the boy's condition. I set up some temporary accommodations. - White magic. Hmm? Oh God, those cuts are deep. Whoever did this was strong, Bear, had passion, you know. Real strong. - Okay, got your napkins in your lap, there you go. No go on, honey, eat up, it's good. Well, I'm glad you got some sleep, you look a lot better. - I really wanna thank you for everything, Carol. It's very kind of you. - It's nothing, Sylvie, really. - It's okay, kiddo, take it easy. Oh, he doesn't eat anything round. - I'm sorry. I can make something square. - That's okay. - How come we have to eat peas if he doesn't. - Well, today nobody has to eat peas, how about that? - What's wrong with him anyway? - Timmy! It's all right, Timmy. Sh, sh, shhhh! Sh, Timmy, sh, it's okay. Shhhh. - Isn't there some place else you'd rather go, Miss Warden? - No. - Timmy? Tim? Timmy? Tim? - So I said to him, Harry, I'm leaving you. I'm a desirable woman in the prime of my life. I'm gonna find a man who appreciates me. So, I packed up all my stuff, and I moved into the pool house. I'm thinking of putting an ad in the personals. Maybe get my hair done. If you were me, would you have sex on the first date? Dr. Rainer? - Hmm? - Play this note for me, Marcus. That's right, that one right there. That's right. Can you play it one more time for me? - Here we are, Timmy. Timmy, look, there's a Dell. Come and sit by me, Timmy. Look who's back. Come here, buddy. - How you doing, honey? You having a good day? There you go. There you go. Pick up this one here, pick it up. There you go. - Here's something for you. Autistic child drowns in Rainer Group Home. - Martha's gone. I'm done. - You cure her yet? - Sure, I told her she'd be crazy not to be crazy. Can I charge her for that? - You know, he wants to use some drug called lorazepam to make Tim talk. I checked the library this morning. It's got all these side effects like massive respiratory failure and inhibition. I mean, what the hell is inhibition? - Disinhibition, it's like a massive breakdown of someone's psychological defenses. - Yeah, but that's my point, don't people need their defenses? I mean, it could make him psychotic, crazy. - Dr. Harlinger knows exactly what he's doing. I'm absolutely sure that he could administer this drug. - But you worked without drugs. You had a group home right here. The Times called you a wizard. - I don't work with children anymore. I've been out of the field a long time. I'm sorry. - You know, I figured out something about death. It's contagious. I know that sounds crazy, but it's like when people you love die, you feel like you should have died too. And you don't want anybody to know that you survived. No one. - He can keep the toy, I have a patient coming. - Jake? Jake? Telephone. Hurry. - I'm sorry, I can't allow visitors right now. The boy must learn that acting out-- - I'm not a visitor, I'm his doctor. - The girl agitated him before the needle came near his skin. She provides for him. If he gets better, she has no purpose. - Open the door, Rene. - This is what brought on tragedy the last time. You mean well, Jake, but you go too far. - Tim, Tim, shh, shh. Tim, it's okay, it's okay. It's all right, see, your sister's here, Tim. - Timmy. - We'll get you out of this right now. Tim, relax. Tim, be careful. - There we go, there we go. No, Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim. Tim, Tim. - Tim, stop. - Shhh, shhh, shhhhh. Shhhhh. - Hi, Jake. Miss Warden, hi, how are you? So? Couldn't just take it when I asked you? - I'm taking it now. - Okay. But I need some answers. I'm hitting the wall on physical evidence. There's no usable prints on the knife, not even a measly tire track. So get me a murderer, Jake, or I'm gonna have to use Harlinger's magic potion on that boy. - Come on. Here we go. Here we go. There we go. - Welcome home, Dorothy. He's very high functioning. - Yeah, but he doesn't show emotion like normal people. I mean he hardly even laughs or cries. He'll never get things for you, unless he knows you really well. He basically just does what he wants. - What about sounds? - He is a great mimic of music and words. But he only copies things, it's like it's never really him. - Sylvie? - I don't understand why I can't stay. - Sylvie. What do you know about autism? - Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder, usually from birth, a perceptual cocoon forms around the child, trapping him in his own private world. - That's very good. Nobody knows what autism is, nobody. 2,000 years ago, autistics were worshiped as gods. And 300 years ago, they were burned at the stake as witches. Now we treat them with drugs, and therapy. I knew an autistic girl once who could create the most unbelievable sculptures. She couldn't button her own shirt. There are autistics who can play entire sonatas after hearing them only once. Nobody knows, nobody knows what autism is, okay? - Okay. - Okay, now that we all know what it is, I'll tell you how it works. Tim? Bring me the cards. - See, he won't do it, he doesn't know you. Tim, honey, bring me the cards. Thank you. Go play, go sit down. - Many autistics like cards. They like numbers, they like music. Anything in sequence. Okay now. Let's say that this 10 is your memory of what happened that night at your house. You have 100 different ways of getting to that memory. The smell of pumpkins, or the creak of a floorboard. But not Tim. For Tim, the only way to get to that 10, that memory, is through the nine, and the only way for him to get to the nine is through the eight, and so on and so on and so on. That's what Tim remembers, the ace, the beginning of the chain. Now, what is Tim's ace? It could be a sound, it could be an image. I don't know, but that's my job. - Yeah, but he doesn't like strangers. He hardly even notices them. - That's why you can't stay. Tim and I have to figure out a way for us to relate, to become friends. Now I'm gonna give you some fenneril. I want you to take it twice a day. It'll help you with the panic. - I'm fine. - And the nightmares. - How did you know? - It's what I do. - Shhhh. Tim, Tim. - How you doing? Is something wrong? - No. I had a dress like that once. - The piece de resistance. Did you know that every great relationship begins over food? Did you know that? Something is missing, ah. Hey, Jolene, your mother called. - Excuse me. Great spot. You know the owner, or do you have to have reservations? - What in the hell are these? - These are therapy bills. Is this a quiz, do I win something? - Why didn't you tell me Darla Warden was a patient of yours? - Well, because, therapy is confidential, even if they happen to be dead, I thought you knew that. - So she won't give a shit who you tell. - It's not relevant. It happened over a year ago, and I only saw her a couple of times. It was just a cursory-- - Goddammit, Jake! - Okay. She was having an affair. - You didn't think that was relevant? - Well, I hate to bust your bubble, pal, but half the women in this town are having affairs. - Did she tell you who the guy was? No. - Look, Jake, let's just cut the self-pity. From now on in this case, what you know, I know, you got it? - Dr Rainer? I'm sorry, Dr. Rainer, it's Harry. He says he wants a divorce. And I love him. - Poor Harry. Dr. Rainer? - I'll get rid of her. I'm sorry, Dr. Rainer. Martha, you don't have a session today. I know, I just really needed to talk to you. He said he wants me to move out. Martha, you see, I do have a patient that I'm seeing right now. I just need a few minutes of your time. I never, ever expecting him to take this seriously. He wants me to leave, he's very serious. You should talk about it. I felt like I had to talk to you. I felt like you would know what to do, what I should do. Hi, where's Tim? He's in the barn. I moved into the pool house, you know, that doesn't say I want a divorce. Where is Harry? - Timmy, oh my God. Timmy! Oh, baby. Baby, are you okay? Are you outta your mind? What the hell is going on here? You're supposed to be helping him, Jake. - I wasn't sure you were coming. - Yeah, well, I had to take him home to change after his class. - I do need your help. - Well, for starters, it's not the cards. It's the voices. - What voices? - Graham family, please proceed to Table 11. Manager to the floor. Hi. - We'd like a table for two please. Mizelle, M-I-Z-E-L-L-E. - Okay. - Sylvie? What exactly are we doing here? - Just wait a minute, Jake. - Jones, party of three, please proceed to Table Nine. Table Two needs a setup, busboy to Table Two please. I'm taking a vacation, and I want you to come with me. - Where you going? - Oh nowhere really. Martin, party of four, Table 10. - Martin, party of four, please proceed to Table 10. - Did you get to any of the game? - Oh yeah. - You all are at the wrong table. - We're just finishing right now. - They just called our name. - Table 17, you're at the wrong table. - Table 17, you're at the wrong table. Please move to Table Six. - We've been here for 20 minutes, and we're at the wrong table? - This is ridiculous. - Today only, free hardshell crabs for all of our guests. - What the hell is going on? - I don't know. - Special, free pitcher of beer for each table, right on the spot. - Well, if we could find some help here. - Why don't you push off? - We'll just stand here while you eat. - Main cashier, please report to the manager. Come on, Timmy, come on. You know, I sometimes wonder if Tim really has a voice of his own. He's got a voice all right. - How come he never uses it? - Well, most folks only see the biology of autism. They see it as a problem with the brain wiring. - Well, what do you see? - I think autism is a kind of great, overpowering fear, of the whole world. There's a boy in here. I just think he's trapped behind a wall. And I think the fact that he's trapped makes him terrified. Take his not fetching things. That's just his fear of surrendering his will. And not using his voice. For Tim, it's safer to be other people rather than himself because when you use your own voice, it's an expression of who you truly are, you know, inside. - Well, you never really know what's gonna set him off. Except for this one thing. - TV shows. - Mm-hmm. - It's called echolalia. Look, up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane. - He'll never do it with a stranger. - Steve Austin, a man barely alive. We can rebuild him, we have the technology. What? - What, you never heard of the Six Million Dollar Man? - No. - It's before your time. Huh, there's a signpost up ahead. Next stop, the Twilight Zone. Space, the final frontier. - Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. - Can I help with something? - It's under control. - I'll help make the salad. - You and Jake seem to be working well together all of a sudden. - I don't know. He runs so hot and cold. I really don't get him at all. - Coulda fooled me. God, I'm sorry, Syl. - I know what you think, but I'm really not interested in Jake. It's just that I feel like he's the only one that can help Tim. And if he can't, they might take him away from me. Come on, harder, try harder, keep it up. That's no help. I'm not gonna play. Come on. - Good to see you, Jake. - Everything okay? - I'm fine, Jake, go on. - Almost got it, watch out. Try to get it now. Try to get it. - Not one single suspect. - What about the lover? - Dead end. - Well for what it's worth, I don't think two sessions is a hell of a lot to base a psychological autopsy on. - What have we got to lose? Why don't you give it a shot anyway? - Okay. Darla Warden was extremely well groomed. She was very sexy. - Yeah, I knew you guys thought about that kinda stuff. She was suffering from a chronic, low-level depression. - Yeah. - She didn't have any close friends. She didn't have any extended family. She talked a lot about her children. She also talked a lot about her total dependence on her husband. - Freddy. Owned his own company, secretary of the PTA, that's all I got, want a beer? - Darla Warden presented her husband as ideal, you know. As near perfect. - Yeah, but nobody's that perfect, Jake. - No, I'm just saying that she presented him as perfect. - Yeah, so, what does that mean? - Well, someone goes to therapy, they give you a picture and oftentimes that picture is made up of the same lies that they tell themselves. I mean, the real question is, if Darla thought he was so perfect, why was she having an affair? - So what you're saying is, she didn't love him? - Do you love your wife? - Of course I love my wife. - So what's upsetting her? - What the hell has that got to do with anything? Could it be you? - Jake, that's personal, all right. - That's my point, all families have secrets. - The smell of ghosts. You're gonna have to tell me what went on in here, kid. Where's Mommy? Come on. Come on. Come on, show me where your mother is. Good. Now. Where's Daddy? Where's Daddy, Tim? - Where's Daddy, on Nick at Night, tonight at nine. - Tim, you've gotta show me something, come on. - Come on, Tim, I've had about enough of this from you. Goddam, you stop this rocking this instant. - Tim? Tim? Tim! Tim. - I'm gonna tell Mitch that I regressed the kid back to that night and he didn't see anything. You know, that he covered his eyes. - You're quitting again, Jake. Everything else is just words. - Karen, listen. - Don't. - You're the one hiding from the world, Jake, not Tim, you. - You are overidentifying with the problems of this child. - Don't you dare psychoanalyze me, you bastard. Oh God. God, Jake, what happened to you? - I pushed too hard. I pushed too hard, with Billy. - Billy's suicide was a tragedy, but you didn't kill Billy. The truth didn't kill Billy. - I lost him. - You have to push. I think I can, isn't that what you used to say? It's not that simple, Karen, okay? - Go on then. You act like you died in the goddam lake with Billy. Well, take the final step. I'm sorry. You have to commit, Jake. That's all Tim needs, all I need. - I want you to talk to me, Tim. What happened that night, what did they say? Please don't hurt me, I'll give you anything you want. Oh my God, he's got a knife. Please don't hurt me. Oh God, I'm bleeding. Don't let me die. Please, don't kill my wife. Leave my children alone. Tim, somebody must have said something. I'm gonna cut you. I want all your money, I'm gonna kill you both. Ow, shit, Karen! Ow. God. Karen? All right, honey, this might sting just a little bit. There we go, there we go. All right, just be still, we've almost got it. I'm sorry, I just thought I'd warm up on the swings before my run, I didn't even think. - Christ, Jake, we shoulda had those swings fixed. - Yeah, yeah. I'm such an idiot, I didn't even look to see if they were like that. - Oh, goddammit. - Goddammit. Goddam, you fuck, oh Jesus. Oh no, oh my God, stop please. I'll kill you, you bastard. I'll kill you. Oh God, let me die now, sweet God, let me die. Let go, let go! Who is that? That's my father. - Who's he talking to? What's he angry about? - I don't know. - Okay. - Oh no, oh my God, stop, please! - Is that you talking? - Mm-mm, no. Then who? - That's my mother. She's frightened. Maybe she sees someone coming in, the man with the knife. - I'll kill you, you bastard, I'll kill you. - My mother again. Maybe she's trying to save my father. Maybe she's trying to stop him. - Oh God, let me die now. Sweet God, let me die. - Sylvie. - My mother. - My dad was dead, she wanted to die. - Let go, let go! - That's me. I guess that's when I came in, tried to get the knife from him. - Okay, then what about Tim? Was Tim in the hallway the whole time? Did he come inside the room with you? Did he run away? Sylvie, he got the knife after you went down. Why wasn't he hurt? - Stop, please stop, I'm really tired, I don't wanna do this anymore, please. - At the very beginning, your father was raging at someone. Who was he angry at? Who did you ever hear him be angry at? When did you ever hear him behave like that? - Who was he ever angry-- - I don't know, I don't know. - Goddam, you fuck, oh Jesus. - Come on, Sylvie. - I can't do this anymore. - Goddam, goddam, you fuck, oh Jesus. - Please? - Syl, help me out here. I don't know. - Goddam, goddam, you fuck, oh Jesus. - Stop! Please, just stop! My father wasn't raging, he didn't rage! - Listen to his voice. Of course he was. What else could he be feeling? - I think someone killed my parents while they were having sex, okay? - What happened in there? What happened in there, kid? Why didn't you get hurt? - It's just too awful to imagine. I had a criminal procedures guy who used to say, put yourself in the place of the victim. Laying there, touching, warming up to each other. And then. I mean, that can't be coincidence. Somebody must have wanted to find them in bed. Must have waited. A lover? - You should wear orange, a man in the woods without orange is liable to get himself shot. What's up, doc? - You tell me. - Nothing. Decided to come out here and clear my head, get a little practice. - What were you thinking, Mitch? You think I was gonna just keep quiet, that I was gonna cover for you? - Okay, Jake. We were on an off for about a year. Women in town, they see a cop, man in charge, they wanna be rescued something. Over the years, I've done my share of rescuing. Usually, once or twice, that's it, you move on, but Darla was different, she was something else. Good is not the word, Jake. It just got outta control. In fact, we were together that same day. Later on, the call came in to the station. I drove out to the house, and I, uh. I didn't kill her, Jake. I was sleeping with her. - Okay. Then what else? - What do you mean what else? - What else are you hiding? - I'm not hiding anything else. I have been thoroughly professional about this. - No, this is not just professional, Mitch. This is personal. This is murder. You know more about her than anybody else. You heard her say things that nobody else heard her say. You know things. That's where your answers are gonna be. - Jesus, Chief, you scared me. Thought everyone was gone for the night. - No, I thought I'd look at the effects again, in case forensics missed anything. - Need some help? - Nah, go home, get some sleep. They'll still be dead tomorrow. All righty. - This one, is your sister. This one's your mom. This one's your dad. - It's late, I made up the spare. - Wanna play some more tomorrow. - Timmy, please stop it. - What's this? - That's Alvin. When, uh, when there were children around here, I used to train the staff with him. People will tell a stuffed animal a hell of a lot more than they'll ever share with another human being. Sit down, talk to him. - No, uh-uh. - Why not? It's good therapy. Come on, he's only a bear. - Hi, Alvin, I'm Sylvie. This is too hard. You know your friend Jake? Well, I can see he's in pain and that he wants to help us. - Sylvie, Alvin knows all about me. - And I wanna help him too, but I feel like we're the same, like the only way we're okay is taking care of someone. I wanna take care of him. I wanna help him. - No. No. No. - I better have won something. Jake, look, it's Mitch. I need you down at the hospital right now, and I mean now. - All right, calm down. Relax, what's going on? I'll tell you when you get down here. And bring the boy. - Okay, I'll be right down. Bring Tim. - Yeah, I'll bring him. I love you too. - Sheriff. - Doctor. - That was a slight. We're supposed to be hurt. I can take your name and number. Yeah, I'll have him call you when he gets in. Sit down, young man. Tell him to sit. He doesn't follow commands, Rene. - Right over here, Tim. Many autistics have unique and fascinating abilities. I'd like to demonstrate one which I think you'll find revelational. - Revelational, I don't think that's a word. Is that a word, I don't think so. - You said no drugs, Doctor. - Oh come on. You know that autistics like this can't be hypnotized into remembering anything. The most you can hope for sometimes is changing their mood. What are you gonna do, hypnotize him into being happy? - Not precisely. As we all know, one of the keys to absolving the boy was insufficient strength. - I'm not gonna allow this. - I spoke to the judge last night. - Don't do this, just tell him, for God sake. - The judge gave me a court order. I don't believe that you're in charge here. - In rare circumstances, autisistics can show remarkable-- - Jake, Jake! I need to see this. - Now I'm gonna count backwards from five, Tim. And when I get to zero, you will be perfectly asleep. You understand? Five, four, three, two, one, zero. Can you hear me, Tim? Can you open your eyes? Sheriff, would you check the door and confirm that it's securely locked? Tim, the lights are going very dim. It is getting very dark in here. Wouldn't it be nice to get out of here? Out into the light? It's so dark in here. It's getting darker, Tim, the light is almost gone. You've got to get out of here, Tim. The darkness is closing in. Hurry, there's no time. The light is almost gone. Get out, now. Stop. When I snap my fingers, you'll wake up. - I'm really impressed, Rene, really impressed. You deserve the Marquis de Sade Award. - Well we know the boy's strong enough, Jake. - Okay, I'll give it to you. Under certain extreme circumstances, autistics can demonstrate, can I remind you that Houdini over here had to hypnotize him into hysterics in order to get him to do it? The boy had no motive at all to kill his parents. - We found semen stains on the sheets. - Aw, so what? So the Wardens had an active sex life. As a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, I think the Wardens were just about to get into it when the killer showed up. I got that already. - I said semen, Jake, but only semen. There was no sign of a woman, no sign of the wife in the bed at all. And, we found these. I found the negatives for these in the back of a picture frame. Now I think that's motive enough for the boy, don't you? - It seems Fred Warden wasn't using his wife for recreation, he was using his son. - You glib, cavalier son of a bitch. - I'm gonna need to keep the boy here for a couple of days, run the medication in a controlled setting. Rainer, you're welcome to stay and observe. You might learn something. - I'm gonna go arrest the boy. - What about the angle of the blade? I can't figure that one, either, but we'll give him Harlinger's drug, and if he didn't do it, we'll know. - Mitch. Mitch. I'm close, and I can do this safely without the drugs. Just give me the day. Come on. - Lake's pretty well iced up. Maybe it'll finally snow. - There never was a man with a knife, was there, Sylvie? - No. - Did you really think that you could protect him? - Right here. Touching Tim, making him pose. Tim must have hidden the knife under the bed. My mother, maybe she came in in the middle, I don't know. I tried to stop him, I tried to get the knife away. Are you gonna tell the police? I'll kill you, you bastard, I'll kill you. Oh God, let me die now, sweet God, let me die. - Well. I guess maybe you can plead insanity, huh? I'm sorry, son. I'm so sorry. - Sylvie, it's time to go. - I cooked. A toast. Drink to us. We're gonna need all the luck we can get from here on in. And to you. For being unpredictable. You know something funny? When you were first gonna take the case, I went and read up on you. Here's to me, girl genius. Bonzai. - Sylvie, enough now. - I mean, Harlinger, all his medications, bet he woulda had Tim talking in no time, huh? But not you. I read about it in the papers. You're old-fashioned. You're a failure, quitter. To Jake, the quitter. That's why I picked you, Jake. I studied your credentials. You were supposed to give it a couple of tries and then just give up. That's all you had to do! - Sylvie, Sylvie, Sylvie. - What will happen to him? No one's ever gonna need you as much as I do. As we do. Stay with me. - Sylvie, listen to yourself. You're not making any sense. - I knew you'd say no. I'm sorry, Jake. You know that medication you prescribed for me, fenneril? Well, I read about in your Physician's Desk Reference. Doesn't have any side effects unless it's mixed with alcohol. And then it causes temporary paralysis. For 30 minutes, you're gonna be a statue. What else can I do? I can just tell them that you tried to seduce me. So, I ran out on the ice. Because I didn't think you'd chase me there. You fell in. You gotta save the people you love. Hello. Sylvie, Sheriff Rivers. - Hi, Sheriff, what's up? I need to talk to you, can I come over? - No, no, I have to run to the store to pick something up for myself. Maybe I could come down there. Come down here, uh. - Okay? - Okay, goodbye Sylvie. - Bye. Tim? Tim? Timmy, Tim? Tim? Tim? - Tim. Tim. Tim. Come in. - Hi, Sheriff. - Miss Warden, what can I do for you? - You called, you said it was important. - Not me, young lady. - You didn't call? - No. - Sorry, Chief, Miss Warden, I'm short on the night shift. Could you take a look at the board a second? - Yeah. Uh, can you wait just a minute, I'll be right back. - Yeah, I'll wait. Okay, talk to me. 911 emergency. 911 emergency. Please state your business. Emergency 911. - Surprise. Now, drowning, that's pretty original. A gun, it's gonna be harder to construct a story about that one. - I think I'll manage. - I have no doubt that you will, like you manage everything else. You were always distracting me, leading me to the voices, cutting your hands. King of Hearts, that's your dad. Queen of Hearts, that's your mother. The jack, that's Tim. And this one, the one that's always standing, that's you. Goddam. - Goddam, you fuck, oh Jesus. - That's the king, your father. Just like we thought. And he's right here, on the bed, touching Tim. - Oh no, oh my God, stop, please. - That's your mom. You can actually hear the fear in her voice. I don't think she's seeing the killer. I think that she's here. Accidentally walking in on your father and Tim. - I'll kill you, you bastard, I'll kill you. - This is where I really blew it. What did we say, that this was your mother attacking the killer, attacking her son? Calling her own son a bastard. I don't think so. I don't think it's your mother's voice at all. Is it, Syl? I think it's a voice just like your mother's. I think that you burst in here and you went straight for that knife. It was him that you wanted. Wasn't it, Syl? Her being here was just some terrible, coincidence. But all those years of turning a blind eye, of her knowing. And keeping quiet. So you stabbed her too. - Let go, let go! - Now that is you. That's you, and you are struggling for that knife. But it's not you trying to take the knife away from Tim. It's Tim trying to take the knife away from you. It wasn't just Tim, was it, Syl? Tim came later. He raped you first. Over and over. For years. I should have seen it. The symptoms were right in front of me all the time. The obsession with your appearance, the exercising, the way that you took on the perfect role for each of us. You were an ingenue for Mitch and a daughter for Karen, and a nymphette for me. You know, abuse victims are always the best actors. They have to be. They live their whole lives with pain, and shame. Pretending that there's nothing wrong. It's the greatest performance of all. - Baby. I'm so sorry. I just couldn't let him touch you like that anymore. You can't know what it's like. You can feel it on your skin. You can feel it running inside of you. The dirt and awfulness. - Sylvie, let me help you. - Don't you understand? No one can know. They'd put me in jail and take him to an institution. There would be no one left to protect him anymore. Step away, Tim, move. - Sylvie, please don't. - Come on! If we're gonna do this thing, let's do this thing. Wanna do this thing? - All right. I think we are too old for this. How does it look for us tomorrow? - The precedents are pretty strong. I think I have a good chance of getting her transferred to a minimum security hospital. Assuming I can get her therapist to show up for the hearing. - I think that can be arranged. - Where's the midget? I feel ridiculous. - You look ridiculous. - You look ridiculous. - Tim, use your own voice. - You look ridiculous. - Oh, you think so, my little pretty? Well, let's do some trick-or-treating, boys. How come he'll only talk with you, Jake? For a mimic, right, change takes time. Right, Timmy?
