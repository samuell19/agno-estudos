"ASHES TO ASHES" "ASHES TO ASHES" Oh, it's on. Who are you? Who are you? What the hell? You look like a panda with that eye. Well, you have a retro-style TV as a head. Wha... What the hell are we doing here? I don't know. I don't remember anything at all. Aren't you cold? I want some clothes. Really? I'm hungry too. I... {\an8\i1}Criminals have appeared. {\an8\i1}Criminals have appeared. {\an8\i1}The police will arrive in one minute. {\an8\i1}Do not interfere with the suspects. We need a car. I got it covered. Hey! This is the police! Slow that vehicle down! They're here, Pandy! Speed up! I'll cause a distraction! P-Pandy! Eat this! Look at us go! We musta been assassins before our memories were erased! Retro, look. What, Pandy? Is that the moon? It looks all chewed up. It feels so good to fuck shit up... In order to protect the public peace, we charge you with trespassing, theft, violence, assault, possession of illegal firearms and much more. Therefore, you will be sent to the Dead Leaves prison facility on the surface of the moon. Imprisoned in Dead Leaves for life. {\fad(0,8000)}Hey! What are you doing? There once was a field with one tall tree. There were many leaves on that tree. A lot of caterpillars made their meals there. In the morning, to the sun... In the evening, to the moon... The tree was so tall, it seemed to reach those heights. "You're always looking at that," the working ants said to the caterpillars. "Hey, you!" "If you're always looking up, won't your necks get tired?" "That's why your bodies are so stretched out, because you're always looking up." What the hell? I can't move! I can't move! Let me out, assholes! Does it really matter? This sucks! Let me go! It's time to eat! Wow. There's so many people here. C-Come back! You too! Ow! What is this place? Even if you don't want to eat, you should. You won't get any more after this. Your TV is nice. So is your dick! It's time to shit! Shit? Shit. I really don't want to right now. It'll come out anyway. Huh? This music won't make it come out. It'll come out. It won't. It'll come out. It won't come out! Something is sucking... It's sucking it out! Relax. What a weird feeling. It was gross, but it felt good. Will you let me put it in too? Dammit! Hey! Prisoner number 9-3-1! 9-3-1! You! You shat too much! Look! Your tube is all backed up! It really stinks! Your head is useless! Your personality is disgusting! I sentence you to death! Three-Seven! Do the honors. Holy crap... You're all just damaged clones! You ain't worth shit! Shit! Understand? Now slide out like the shit you are! Shit, I'm done. Dammit... Here we go again... It's best not to piss off Three-Six and Three-Seven. Their bodies are built differently from ours. Don't misunderstand anything they say. We're all genetic mistakes, and they treat us like guinea pigs. I see. I'm a clone. There's nobody here who isn't a clone. It's okay. If we die today, tomorrow there will be another batch of clones just like us. It's okay to die anytime. Are you okay? Heh! I'm a doctor! A lot of people died on my operating table, so they sent me here. How about you? Me? I lost my memory, so I have no idea. I woke up naked outside on a street. You can't remember anything at all? Well, I do remember one thing. It's probably from a child's book. It's a story about caterpillars looking up at tree leaves. Then some working ants said to the caterpillars: "Hey, you! If you're always looking up, won't your necks get tired?" {\t(0,2540,\1c&HBEA5E9&\3c&H0F116C&)}Your bodies are so stretched out because you're always looking up. If you stretch too much, you'll break. I'll sew you back together. We won't need anesthesia... Wow! If you don't quit daydreaming, you'll be next! They're really messed up. I won't let that happen to me. It's called the "mutation gene," which is pretty easy to say. They illegally tamper with the body's appearance genes so that we become ugly mutants. They can do what they want because nobody in the sky cares what happens. If we had a fight, who'd be stronger? Shit! Shit! What's wrong with you? Warden, today we took eight samples, had fifteen deaths, three copies and five breakdowns. Nothing else to report. I'm getting bored. Quit it. What are you doing? There's nothing we can do in this position. We have those holes for shitting, remember? Idiot! Not there! S-Sorry! Thanks for the meal. Thanks for the meal! How did we know how to do that? Dunno. Whatever. That was incredible! That was amazing sex! H-How did you know how to get out of your shackles? I don't know. Please take us with you! Oh, sure. Bro! Master! Mother! General! Mistress! Boss! It was you who gave us our freedom. We would be honored to dedicate our lives to you. Now give us your instructions. What are you talking about? You don't want a master with no memory. No! That sex you had was amazing! You snapped our shackles with such ease! You were born to be our leader! Your capabilities as a leader are as big as my dick! Oh, yeah! We must have been yakuza before we lost our memories! Uh, you really think so? That's definitely it! We did a lot of bad things, so they eventually caught us! We are pretty villainous. All right! We've solved the mystery! But I don't think that's totally right... Listen up! Since I'm the boss, you will do anything I want you to! It's up to me whether you live or die! I'll do anything I want, as much as I want! That's it? Okay, first we have go to the port and get a ship. Prison break! Prison break! What the hell? Here you go! Warden! Well, Mistress, the show has begun. Now for chapter one... Boss! Is this really the right way? Uh... I'm sure it's somewhere over this way. Probably. Our boss always knows! Huh? What the hell is this? Get the fuck out of the way, assholes! Huh? Won't you let us pass, oh mighty elite clone overseer? Am I getting through to you?!{real fake keyframe} Ow! They're coming out like machine gun bullets. It never ends! We have to get out of here, now! Okay, everyone! Let's run! Hold on to the back of this bike! Aw! The Boss is the only one who gets to ride! Ow! Ah! Geh! Boss, my face is burning! Boss, it's too narrow! Deal with it! Where are we? It's a cargo passage. Okay. If we take this passageway straight, we'll go right to the port! You needed to pick up the pace, fellas! Your next opponent is waiting. What's going on? It's huge! And so smooth... Wow, Boss! It's a robot! A robot! Run! Run!! It's here! Run! It's going to eat us! They're gaining! It's not working! What do we do now? That's it! Dick! Yeah? Give me your dick! Coming!

Damn! It's narrower than before, Boss! I can't take it! It feels good to be squeezed! Idiot. This is it! It's incredible that we went straight to the armory! How did you know it was there, Boss? I don't know! I'm all set with this. They're pretty good. They're very energetic for being in cold sleep for that long. But now it gets serious. Let's see you take us down now! Sergeant, are you okay? A train! A train! A train! This will definitely take us to the port! Get on! Get on! Hurry up! Departure! Pandy! Pandy! Scumbag, eat this! How's it going? Boss! Can we really reach the port this way? Absolutely! Yeah, definitely. Why? Why do we know so many things? Like where the armory was. We must have been to this prison before. Before we lost our memories. Well, we were Yakuza, after all! We must have been put away here. Oh, Heaven, please forgive us for our violent words and actions. It's a bit late for that now. Well, let's kill them all! Mistress, it's Chapter 3. Get ready to stand by. I'm ready. Cheers! What the hell? Next to the armory was a liquor storage room! Hey! Is there a doctor here? I'm a doctor. She said she felt bad and suddenly started puking. Her belly is so big! She's pregnant! T-This is so sudden... When did this happen? Well, if you think back a little... Huh? Me? That was just a little while ago! So he came inside her? I envy him! It could be a very good thing! Your child carries the mutation gene! The mutation gene is very powerful. What's that? You don't know? Nope. You really don't remember anything at all? Nope. Let me explain then. Our past! In fact... I'm a secret agent? A spy? I don't know for sure, but that's what it seems like. You were both here years ago, and for some reason the warden made you do secret work for the prison. That all ended one day years ago. That day, I... A secret agent! Hey, I wasn't finished... What's wrong? Your red eye is throbbing, isn't it? Something is nearby... You're having a reaction... It's those two for sure. The children of the mutation gene, the last of the living weapon experiments: Three-Six and Three-Seven. The Grim Reaper is hot on the tail of you two. What the... This isn't the way to the port! What? We're heading in the opposite direction! Stop the train! Can't you put on the brakes? Do something! Pandy! It's them. "Them"? Band together! Now you will all die! Avenge the Sergeant! Fire! You'll never hit me! That's impossible! You don't listen. I told you I'd kill you all! Your shitty bullets can't touch me! Don't run your mouth until you've faced the real deal! Boss is a spy! A spy! We seem to have some things in common. But it doesn't look like you two wanna chat. Someone's going to die, and it won't be us. Your panties are next! I love your panties. Boss! Dick, are you all right? Now do a line dance! Dick, I think we're screwed on this one. Take this! Where are we? The factory. What the... This is the prison's secret work... To use genetic engineering to illegally create living weapons through the mutation gene. The warden made a living selling them on the black market and to the Army. But eight years ago, there was a terrible incident in the factory involving the mutation gene. You happened to be there when the accident happened, and the gene was lodged in your eye. I remember now. I was reading a book to someone after her father was gone. The sad caterpillars in the children's book. When they grow up they can fly up to the leaves. They have to eat a lot until their green skin is broken open. She thinks I killed her father. She's revised history. She wants revenge. So I want you to kill that trouble-making creature! That filthy whore! Wait! I can't do that for you! You're still alive, Doctor Quack? Die! Is that all of them? Boss! So strong! That's power! I can't beat him... Shit! With my dick's size and rigidity, I will not be beaten! No... The robot got hacked? But we can't keep our honored guest waiting. Eh? Still? Again? Now pray to God! My God is drilling into your head! Now you pray! Wait, what? Your blessings are gone, clone scum! It exploded? That's it! Die! Don't kill her! Don't kill her... Don't kill her! You're too late. It takes you a long time to remember, doesn't it? Hey, have you ever believed something for years... ...and found out that you completely had the wrong impression and totally misunderstood? Never! You're completely wrong. I've never made that mistake. You got your stubbornness from your father. It's been eight long years. Am I in time? What's up? It looks like we were in cold sleep for awhile. Huh? Really? So that's why we can't remember anything. Eight years ago there was a accident at this factory. We escaped, but the capsule malfunctioned and made an emergency landing on Earth. I don't get it. Well, no point in explaining it to you then. But it is funny. You and I were fighting over your father. Huh? So she's your ex-boyfriend's daughter? That means you're a slut! That was years ago, but I remember it like it was yesterday. It was yesterday to me. Doesn't matter. I don't care. Give me the mutation genes in your right eye. They're really Papa's, after all. If I get them I can complete his plan. No way. No. You want a fight? This body I got from Papa will help me kill you and take that eye. I should tell you this first... I couldn't care less about that perverted old freak. And I don't care what you did until now, either. You're being selfish as usual. Some bitch like you can't get me. Sorry! You're not worth my time. I really just want to sleep. See ya. Hey! She looks really pissed. You sure about this? I can't see out of my right eye. My belly hurts really bad, too. You should get out of here. Huh? Hey! Wait... Here's something for you. You don't have a reason for us to fight, right? Fine, then. I'll give you a reason! It's reacting! This power is far beyond our expectations! I really want it now! Having to work for it makes me happy! How's this? Things have changed over the years! Not bad. What is it? Are you hungry? Is it the grippe? Her belly? A baby? I see. It's the child of a mutation gene carrier. That's the best material! You don't need that right eye anymore. All of the genes are being pulled into that baby in your belly. This is the completion of the plan that Papa created and I have kept alive. Goodbye, sis. Wha? What? Huh? What the hell? I don't have a body! Madam... Madam... What's up with you? You survived? No, what's up with you? You're just a head now. What was that? Oh, look! It's glowing! Pandy? Madam... Mother... Retro, you survived? Yeah, but we need to hurry and reattach my body... Isn't there something you can use for the time being? Eaten... Nothing I see shocks me anymore. Papa! What the hell is that? She wants to live out the children's book. "The huge caterpillar grew into an even larger butterfly." What does that mean? Well, it's not great, but this will do for my body. It fits you. Hey, I can't do anything with this! What in the hell? That thing is bigger now! Hey! Well, usually I wouldn't feel much responsibility for it... Hurry up and let's get the hell out of here! Mother! Mama! I think the only way to destroy it is to jump into its mouth and set off an explosion. Won't that get us killed, too? Mama... Are you okay, Pandy? It's no good. I'm too weak. Hey! Hey! Don't let your shield down! There's no atmosphere around us! Wait! I don't really understand any of this, but we can't let our son go alone! Papa... It's really sad. We just had a baby and all. He went from conception to birth to old age to death in one day. I don't really feel anything. Look. Now the Moon is even more chewed up. I wonder what we really are. I know what happened eight years ago, but I still can't remember any of it. Were we really spies or just bad guys or clones or what? Does it really matter? I guess it doesn't. We're away from the surface of the Moon. Hull integrity has been compromised! We've entered Earth's atmosphere! Wah! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Where's the escape pod? Emergency procedures initiated. Emergency procedures initiated. Automatic cold-sleep system engaged.
