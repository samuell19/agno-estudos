THE CALLAMPAS (The Shantytowns) [literal: The Mushrooms] All characters and events in this movie are real and were filmed in authentic places. This is the capital of Chile Skyscrapers rise to the sky proud and defiant as a symbol of achievement. However, just five blocks from the downtown on the bank of the Mapocho River a dire picture sadly overlooked by us is presented in the truthful scenes of this film. Shacks made of cardboard, tin, and old boards rise on the bank, in places that no one would dare to build a house on apart from the men, women, elders and children that are part of the helpless crowd of this shantytown made up of 160 shacks. The first segment of a large array of villages that follow the course of the river's waters. This is the life center of a village Main line of circulation between stinking puddles mud, and semi-destroyed shacks. Here lies the market the square opens and the entertainment center is established. This is where the social life of the callampa is made. The water jet from the tap becomes the most valuable object Clean water, not from the river. Rising early is necessary to get some. Long queues of people stay put in open air during the day. Buckets acquire an important value. And it doesn't matter all the sacrifice nor the troubles people have to go through because here, water is vital as a medicine. But the spirit never wanes in the callampa. A stretch between to shacks a bunch of thatch as bedding and the spirit to keep living and working are good enough for a 70 year old to install his house and shoe repair shop here. In this environment, children don't lose their smiles. They laugh and dream. A little car is a luxurious toy even if it was picked up from a dump like this one, that barely advances but serves as an actual car. Some toys entertain until from them a destructive force emerges This may not be the time to hang up clothes. The river waters are good for having fun or as bath or as washing place and although always cold and dirty they are indispensable. Inside the city more than 15 blocks form the stretch of this community of human beings that live pushed to the unsafe lands eroded by the waters. Night of October the 26th of 1957 At the other end of the city there is widespread fear. In a village of 53 blocks with more than 30 thousands inhabitants for the tenth time, there is a fire. Many thousands of people are left helpless by the side of the stinky course of the old Zanjón de la Aguada During ten days they move puzzled above the debris and ashes searching... 130 shacks have burned down in a few hours Is it worth to try to rebuild everything? And they spend weeks without shelter, without hope. Is it worth to try to rebuild everything? While the parents try to solve the shelter issue for their children. Kids have their own problems. They've stop laughing they don't have any toys left just...hunger. A pacifier may silence a cry and deceive the stomach but not for long. Some are awaiting surrounded by loneliness and fear What may happen next? Hunger is cruel exasperating. A dialogue of kid's glances in a timeless suspense. Where can there be a pacifier? What a pity, it was broken. Is it worth to try to rebuild everything again? Public authorities are alarmed by the disaster What to do for these people that lack everything. It is worthy to raise everything up again? Beside the stinking course of the Zanjón de la Aguada? No! It's not possible. Seeking a solution by their own means thousands of men, women, elders and children walk two kilometers into the city. It's 2:00 AM of October 30th, 1957. They're going the La Victoria site, promised for many years. They're the first that are willing to stop the advance. Every single one of them. started advancing towards La Victoria. A 2 km dusty and sunny road turned into a human trail during many days. They couldn't expect better transportation means Thereupon they loaded themselves and walked. DREAM OF THE CALLAMPERO But is everyone's duty to be united destroy the old callampa to start a stable and permanent life in La Victoria. The idea entrenched in them and united and almost joyfully indulged in destroying the callampa. Nothing should be left. Everything should be destroyed in order to start anew. Without distinction of creed or political affiliation a group of men form a task force. They work day and night towards an equitable distribution of lands that considers the needs of each family. Because people now start thinking about the family. They must start over but something is encouraging the land is now their own. For the first time in history the nation witnesses a peaceful movement in which everybody works in conjunction towards a minimum standard of well being. The burning sun of the day and the ruthless cold of the night spread dismay in the rustic streets of La Victoria. But... the human heart is restless. In those difficult times where failure and disorganization could've destroyed all this effort someone arrived dressed like a callampero secure, enthusiastic it was Father Del Corro. He erected his tent here moving incessantly from that day on from one place to another. Looking for materials for emergency housing construction he rapidly advances through La Victoria whose extension is equivalent to 60 blocks in Santiago and whose population is equivalent to half the city of San Bernardo. Very close to the city center the Hogar de Cristo's panels factory is located to where many times a day comes Father Del Corro searching for building materials made by the hands of young students. Each new load of panels brings hype to La Victoria Because it means, walls shadow, shelter, home. Specialized personnel from the Hogar de Cristo erects each emergency home in three hours. Stimulation, teaching, and example fuel interest among the villagers those aren't just emergency housing anymore now that man that seemed crushed in the middle of a messy and unhygienic callampa village embarks enthusiastically to erect his new home on a land that he acknowledges as his own and with the help of those who ask nothing of him, except his own self-improvement. On many points across the city outskirts the Hogar de Cristo builds stronger houses college youngsters, work voluntarily to help a working class family to get a new home. In a house like this children are better and we can talk about love because love emerges from peace. 800 well-built houses like this form the cooperative villages spread across Santiago Two months of work and sacrifice have passed in La Victoria Who could recognize now that wasteland where the first flags were raised? Today, there are 4300 homes in which 22000 human beings sleep that 60 days ago had been left in abandonment and misery Now even the gooses are owned and are not confused with the neighbor's ones. This allows people to visit each other and comment without much trouble. This is a true story, without an ending because 400 thousand people almost a third of the city of Santiago still lives in callampa villages. Here's La Victoria Symbol of human struggle and solidarity. This is the true story of a friend of yours that is truly in need.
