MAJDANEK Europe's Cemetary Directed by Aleksander Ford 25th July 1944 Lublin, center of the first people's government in 1918 again celebrates the rebirth of the Polish democratic statehood. Lublin saluted freedom! Victorious Polish and Soviet armies brought it with its bayonets. Lublin saluted sovereignty, which was announced to the exhausted country in the first Manifesto of the Polish Committee of National Liberation. Lublin saluted red and white flag that flaunted across the city for the first time after many years of captivity. Lublin said farewell to those who have fought for freedom but didn't live to see it. The clamor of battle was already approaching the city, when in Lublin's prisons, while preparing themselves for escape, German executioners killed the best sons of our nation. What we found in the Lublin castle were victims of Hitler's last crime. Peasants, workers, intellectuals, men and women, boys and girls... There was blood up to the ankles. It flowed from the third floor to the ground, through the ceiling and walls. Every drop of blood from Hitler's new Katyn is mourned by someone. Every drop calls for revenge. Majdanek! "Stop. Keep away." "No photography allowed." "Whoever comes near will be shot without warning." This is... Vernichtungslager Majdanek. Barbed wires, guard towers, machine guns, high voltage electricity and reflectors, the SS Men and police dogs. No escape from the German death camp. Every day thousands sent to annihilation. Every day thousands of incoming new victims. Devastated by the powerful strike of the Red Army, fleeing Germans attempted to cover these crimes but didn't have enough time for everything. We found here a fantastic scene. Ashes are still settling. Snippets of some photographs. Mountains of stacked boots. Wide fields of lush cabbage. And people with burnt numbers on their chests. Human remains, half-dead... half-crazy from terror... Executioners who didn't manage to escape, SS-Obersturmf?hrer Anton Thernes, and SS-Rottenf?hrer Theodor Sch?llen stood before the Polish-Soviet Commission for the investigation of German crimes at Majdanek. Chairmen of the Commission: Witos and Kudryavtsev, members: priest Dr. Bialkowski, president of the Polish Red Cross Society Dr. Christians. Foreign journalists were also there. Obersturmf?hrer Thernes, one of those who didn't manage to escape from Lublin. Today he appears as a witness, tomorrow he will be held responsible for all the villainy of the camp's torturers. Military rank: First lieutenant and Obersturmf?hrer Obersturmf?hrer will tell us about the murders on the territory of the camp. About 21 March... no, October, a transport came from Warsaw... and by this transport the first camp physician Lanke... he sorted out the people according to ability and inability to work... and that day he pulled out about 500 people... and afterwards they were all gassed. Among them were many women and children. He tells that in October 1943 a carriage of prisoners arrived to Majdanek. From that group the doctor singled out 500 persons as incapable for work. They were all gassed and burned, among them a huge number of women and children. Such events happened in Majdanek every day. It's unclear why Thernes brings out an incident of no great importance. He could rather talk about 3rd November 1943 when 18 400 people were shot in Majdanek. I'm not a sadist. I haven't beaten anyone, never. Never. I am not a sadist, no. Never. Never been a sadist. I don't know these things. I am too much fine. Thernes claims he's a very subtle man. Are you familiar with principles of international law? Yes, in Geneva, this... that no one may be shot, a prisoner, that the addresses are exchanged, that the Red Cross, their planes and their ships, may not be fired upon, that's the Geneva Convention, isn't it? Witness speaks that in accordance with the Geneva Convention it's forbidden to treat prisoners badly. Here we have another war criminal. SS-Rottenf?hrer Sch?llen. This man pulled out gold teeth from the victims with pincers. Today he assures us he wouldn?t harm a fly. He curses at Hitler and the SS to demonstrate his moral level. He tells shocking stories about life in the camp. Let's hear one of them. I've been told about... By the prisoners. In the gas chamber accounted... about 150 children...all exterminated. Sch?llen says he witnessed the killing of 150 children. I have seen after two days a still living group selected from the mass. I've seen several dozen such cases. I observed from afar. Germans, members of the SS, walked with rods, and finished off those people with rods. After they've pulled them out from the ditch. I saw among others a badly wounded woman who got out from under a corpse and crawled maybe ten meters more when the SS man, not even with his rod but with his boot, kicked her in the head a few times, and she died... They were burning corpses at Majdanek after this execution for maybe 12 to 14 days. They were burning on average 1500 bodies every day. There was a need to hurry up. So, for that purpose special gas chambers were built. There were 6 gas chambers, but only 2 were working. One with an old technology, and the other with a new one. Here, German wickedness crossed every imaginable line. The gas chambers were connected to the baths. Everyone who was going there never knew where they were going. To take a bath... or to take the final journey. From that bath they were all moved and squeezed in, so that they were standing naked very close to each other, to a chamber where they were killed. The commission of technical experts, after they got to know the materials from the investigation, and based on the material evidence, established that at Majdanek German executioners killed about 2 million innocent people. Among them died many important people from all of Europe. The digging has started. Every strike of shovel brings new victims. Every hour of the search brings to the surface new rows of corpses. Those who were killing, German ?bermensch. It was enough to take them their guns to reveal the real faces of these cowardly degenerates. Only yesterday, accompanied by the sounds of the waltz by Strauss, they killed women and children. Today they want to buy themselves out and obediently show the known places where lay hidden traces of their most terrible crime. The sad cemetary of Majdanek grows. New piles of bones and skulls. New layers of ash from the human bones and the human dust. Look. Here's Majdanek. Long rows of colored little houses, Curtains on the windows, streets sprinkled with gravel. Water supplies and gardens with flowers. Everything for service. SS pubs, SS canteens, SS brothels, even SS toilets! "SS only" Deutschland ?ber alles triumphs. But prisoners are not forgotten. SS cares about hygiene in the camp. Here's bath-house number one. Badeanstalt Nummer eins. Prisoners are taking baths. On the opposite side is Badeanstalt Nummer zwei. The bloodiest baths known to humanity. Prisoners have to take their clothes off. Clothes have to be put on hangers punctually. Then they enter the baths. They must squeeze, fill the whole Badeanstalt so there's no free space at all. Iron doors are sealed hermetically. Nothing can be seen, darkness. The hand of the executioner opens the can of zyklon. Aquamarines crystals of gas, death in horrifying pain. Through the barred little window the SS executioner observes the agony of the victims. He needs to hurry, new victims are waiting. The death factory is outstandingly organized. Gassed victims are sent to the crematoria. They are made from hardened bricks, five furnaces, fire-resistant grates, hermetical iron doors. If the victim has too long legs or hands, they can be chopped off. Everything's calculated. Special transporters for the corpses. Loading blocks, electric bore evacuators, guaranteeing high temperature and, above all, no waste of time. Cremation takes 25 minutes, the capacity of one furnace is 6 bodies. The chimney is a few dozen meters in height. This is contemporary German architecture. An indestructible monument to the contemptuous times. The Rechkemmer firm advertises its work. It was they who delivered all these technical devices. How much is left of a man... But Majdanek wasn't only a camp of destruction. It was also a plant where man became the factory product. There is ash, but there are also by-products of death. Nothing falls out from German hands. They'll supply millions of Germans with items for daily use. Transports with stolen goods were leaving Majdanek daily. To this day, German women are walking around in stockings from Majdanek, Treblinka, Auschwitz. German "Gretas" wear gloves from the chopped off hands. German children play with bloodied dolls. Germans live off someone else's blood and sweat. In this barracks 800 000 pairs of boots were found. Men's, women's, children's. Every pair carries the fate and the torment of man. Better boots were sent directly to Germany. Worse were repaired here in the shoemaker's workshop. The worst were made back to raw material. Trembling hands of a half-dead slave can do a miracle. The old shoes were turned into handbags and buttons, cases for powder, elegant trinkets for women. 800 000 pairs of boots, 800 000 killed. But this is not all. Mothers search in vain the traces of their children at Majdanek cemetary. How many of those are there after whom no shoe or document was left or anything except a handful of ash in the crematory? Even the human dust feeds the German cannibals. On the fields that were fertilized with the bones of the murdered German cabbage now grows luxuriously. There's one more way of exploiting the ashes. German state sells urns with remains of the murdered to their families. 1000 zlotys for 150 grams of ash. There are no limits to German perfidy. Ex-prisoner at Majdanek, French I want to thank Polish and Russian soldiers for liberating me from the extermination camp. We suffered here from unspeakable torment. I and my comrades in misery, people of all nations. Frenchmen, Belgians, Dutchmen, Poles... The real International of the German slaves. Candidates as much as you want... Ex-prisoner at Majdanek, Dutch They killed my 4 brothers. My mother and father died during the war. I suffered a lot. They tortured me. Destroyed... These are the luckiest ones, the ones who managed to be saved. Human ruins... Ex-prisoner at Majdanek, Belgian I spent two years behind the wire. I was in a lot of camps during that time, but what happened in Majdanek was monstrous beyond anything I had seen. Millons of people starved and beaten. Germans were fair. Behind the wire of Majdanek people of all races and nations were dying. Ex-prisoner at Majdanek, Austrian Through that chimney thousands flew away in smoke. They were destroyed because they represented a worldview opposite to the principles of the national socialism. Free Lublin, its people and their army salute the memory of the heroes. To the west follow the retreating enemy. Words of a song that has become a prayer and an oath of the fighting Poland. THE END
