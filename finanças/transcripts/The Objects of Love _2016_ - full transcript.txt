THE OBJECTS OF LOVE - Hi. - Hi Ricardo! How are you? This is Luz. Ciao, Giulia. How are you? Did you have a good trip? Yes. Did you understand? She didn't get anything. Come. I´ll show you. Come on. I'll show you your room. Do you need some help? This is your room, this is your bed. This is Aurora's, a Peruvian girl. She's cool. You'll see that you'll become friends in no time. And here? And here? Two people. Boys or girls? Boys, but don't worry, they're serious guys. I only want serious, hard working people here… Don't you worry. Speaking of serious; Have you told her about the rent? It has to… Yes, that it has to be paid on time. Oh, yes, of course. Please make sure to always pay before the fifth of the month. You can store your things in those cabinets. There's a bit of everything here. How many people live here in total? Four people. No, I mean in the whole house. It depends. Now we're ten, sometimes six, seven, eight, it comes and goes... Four here. I mentioned it because there's only one bathroom... Yes, it's true. But it depends because some people leave very early… Sure... Do you want to think about it? Think about it! We meet later. Honestly, I had something else in mind. How much can you pay? Would 450, 500 euros be alright? Monthly? No. I could pay 150, but… Luz, 150? There are worse things than that. Rome is expensive, difficult… I've been here 25 years. There are worse things; I know from experience. But if you're not convinced,... I gave 50 euros to the lady… Yes, I know. I've brought my dollars… They don't accept dollars here. It's euro here, I know. But nobody... No, you have to exchange them. I have to exchange them. And where? - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Luz. - Aurora, pleased to meet you. - You come from Peru, don't you? - Yes, I do. - The landlady told me. - And you? - I'm from Colombia. Just got here. - From Colombia? - Yes, got here in the morning. Oh wow, so you're freshly baked. What does that mean? We call "freshly baked" the people who just got here. I'm freshly baked then. So how long have you been living here? - Some time. - Here in this room? - Yes. - Do you like it? - So-so. - It's hardly a nice place, isn't it? - Yes. Was he supposed to return last night? - Yesterday. - Yesterday. But he hasn't come... No, he hasn't. I called him in the morning, but didn't answer. - Maybe he had some sort of problem… - You think so? I am worried because he's not answering and I don't know… But you know him, right? Is he your friend? No, I wouldn't say so. He's a friend of my cousin. I met him in Bogotá once and he told me he would help me here. But I thought he was your friend... He's not my friend. Ricardo has slept here like you and others. But long ago. He brings me people from time to time. I thought he was your friend Because giving your money, all your dollars to a person you don't know… Yes, I gave "tutti" to him. - No. - Nothing? What a scoundrel… What happened? What did he do to you? Why are you like this? Because he's a man I met yesterday... Well, I knew him from before, but… I met him yesterday. And he told me that he would exchange my dough, since I only had dollars. So he went to exchange my dough and he hasn't returned. Hasn't he returned? You cannot trust anyone around here. How could you give him your money? Because I couldn't pay with dollars and didn't know where to go… I understand you. He seemed like a good man. Do you know him, perhaps? - His name is Ricardo. - No, I don't know him. - He knows the landlady. - Did you ask her? - Yes, but she didn´t... I don't know what I'd do if I don't find him. - Is this one? - Yes, it is. Hey Luz, don't mention where we live. Why? Because the place where we live is very ugly and is better if others don't know. - Is better that way just to avoid trouble. - Alright. You should know that during the training period… you will not get paid. "Tirocinio" means training. You will not get paid until you learn. Yes, I know. She explained it to me. The learning period, but afterwards… How long is the learning period? It depends on you. If you're fast and get things quickly. It depends how fast you learn things. A week… As soon as you have learned your job well, you'll get paid. - I am a quick learner. - Good. - Do I sign here? - Yes, please. Take this. Take the paper. Put a little bit in here... and wipe. - Can I move things around? - Yes, here. This too? Yes, on top of that. Perfect. - Are you from Lima? - Yes, I am. - Is it different from here? - Totally. This city is very old. But that's what makes it beautiful. It's beautiful for a visit, but not to stay. I personally don't like it. Everything moves so slowly here and I am very active. People here are just... fed up with their life. In my opinion... It´s very nice. I like its churches and castles… but it's very filthy, right? - Lot of tourists... - Abandoned. It's not abandoned. It's the tourism, the people. Just think about it… Or they smoke… I´m so shocked when I go to the park here. I see mothers with their babies in their strollers... and they're holding a cigarette in the hand. Even at the hospital entrances... they have smoker zones. - Ok. - Well? We place this here. This we leave on the pillow. - On? - Yes. Ok. Done. - Tired? - Yes, it's tough, huh? It´s hard. You have been doing this long, huh? You get used to it. After all it´s easy. Doing all the beds is ok with another person, but alone… Yes. It's important that the beds are really neatly made. Things are slowly falling into place and it makes me very happy. I'm sure your son will be happy too. How's he doing without me? I show him your pictures as you ask me, and he misses you of course when he sees them. Now with the internet he can see you more often. It will be good for him. But he's doing great. He's very smart. He's now sleeping in my room. - Yes, I imagine. - I don't want to wake him. That's why I'm speaking from here. Luz, get up! Let's go have breakfast. How did you get here? My sister came to me, when I used to be a student in Peru. One day, my sister told me, Would you move to Italy? Italy? Sure, I'd go. But I did not know where it was. Didn´t you have a good life there? Why did you decide to leave? I was a student. But we are many siblings... and my mother worked at a restaurant. She worked very hard, still does, but not as much as before. She wanted us all to study, but the age difference between us is very small… - How many siblings are you? - Seven. When I finished high school, about to study at a university... it was too expensive. - And I felt sorry. - Are you the youngest one? No, I´m the fifth. My older brother was at the university. So I was next to study, as well as my other brother after me... my poor mom. She had to work too hard. So I gathered the courage, quit my studies and left. How did you do it? Did anyone help you? Yes. My sister found a contact person... through a Bolivian man. I was sent to Bolivia... and they changed my documents there. What do you mean? They changed my passport... everything to stay as a legal Bolivian immigrant. And why? Back then Bolivia had free entrance, you only needed a passport to be admitted. There was no need for visa. That was possible in Bolivia back then. You only showed your passport and were let in. But that wasn't possible in Peru. Did you have to pay for that? Yes, I did. I paid 8,000 dollars. - That's a lot of money! - Yes, a lot. Did you have those savings? My sister lent me the money. Did you have to pay her back? Yes, of course. All of it. - Working here? - Working. I paid off my debt in a year. - Very well. - Yes, in a year. I had no money left, but I paid it all off. How come you had no money left? I only had five euros left… Can you believe it? I don't know how I managed… Five euros a day? - A month! - Five euros a month! - And did you live off it? - Yes, I did. How could you manage with that? I found a job where I could have breakfast, lunch and dinner. Really? And how did you pay your transport? Transport is for free here. I mean, we normally had to pay, but we don´t... - We just get in, we always do it… - Exactly. - Did you ever get caught? - Of course. What happens when you get caught? - You have to pay a fine of 50 euros. - I see... So did you leave Bolivia with anyone else? No, I left alone. - And how old were you? - 19. - You were very young! - Yes, I was. If someone told me to do it again today, I wouldn't do it. - You wouldn't? - No. - Because my trip has been an odyssey. - What do you mean? From Bolivia I was sent to Chile. We travelled by land. It is very far. Why to Chile? If I flew from Bolivia to Madrid and then to Italy, The Bolivians would notice that I am not Bolivian. - I see... - And I had a Bolivian passport. They would've made me return. I couldn't take the risk. 8,000 dollars... - You would've lost them. - Of course. I had to pay them back... So, how did you arrive in Chile? I travelled by land. I travelled by bus during three days. So far. - You must've been very nervous... - It´s very far. What happened when you arrive to the airport in Chile? The man who changed my passport... gave me a couple of tips that I memorized quickly. He told me to take the bus from Bolivia to Chile… and to buy the flight ticket once in Chile. He told me to make a hotel reservation, for they'd ask for a voucher. To enter the country as a tourist, right? Yes, because they call the hotel to confirm. - Sure, they call to confirm. - To confirm who you are. And no one told you anything in Chile? - Yes, they did. They made me suffer. - How so? - They asked me all possible questions. - What did they ask you? Who was the Bolivian president, who was the national hero… - Did you know the answers? - No, nothing. - So, what did you do? - Nothing, nothing… I gave random answers. What do you mean? I made up names. Really, I made up names. Didn't they notice? I think they did, for they made me stay, but they must have felt sorry for me... so they let me through in the end. - So lucky, right? - Because I was also ironic in my answers. I wasn't nervous. I answered smiling and made them laugh too. I think thats why they let me through. It was embarrassing… So what happened in Madrid? They didn't control me in Madrid. I was lucky. We normally get spotted from far when we get through security. Spotted as what? As Latino. They think we’re carrying drugs. But that's not true. - You weren't carrying anything. - No, I wasn't. I remember I had to go to the toilet… and I passed several security control points, but they let me through. - Perfect! - Yes, that's how I arrived in Torino. - Were you more relaxed there? - No. Because the trip was not over yet. Are you crazy? I asked myself how many more security control points I had to go through. So was it better in Turín? Do you call Torino Turín? Yes, we do. Torino is in Italian, right? In Spanish is Turín, here you say Torino. - Was it easier there for you? - Yes, it was. - Were you controlled there? - Yes, they did. They searched for drugs in my bag. But I didn't have any, so I was relaxed. They could search all they wanted. But they found old clothes. I brought all my old clothes with me. And aren't you supposed to do that? No, tourists don't travel with old clothes. I see... I also brought some winter clothes. It was July, summer, and it was super hot. And they laughed! Of course, you brought winter clothes. Yes, I brought thick coats and pants... And the budget travel was also very important. I had 2.000 dollars and they asked me to show them. And they counted it. I had everything in one dollar notes, so it looked like I had lots of money. - You wanted them to think... - That I had lots of money to spend, But they didn't know that I had to return that money. They let me pass in the end and as I walked off, they said in Italian: "You´d better take care of the "nonos"!" - But I didn't understand. - So what did they mean? Take care of old people. They didn't believe that I was a tourist. They knew that I came here to work. And they let you pass! - Yes, they did. I was lucky. - So lucky. Let me tell you this: If you want to find an Italian, you have to learn tango with Italians. - Is it really so? - They want to have fun. I love dancing. You can go to bachata or salsa lessons… There's a lot of them. - Lot of Italians? - Yes, and they usually go alone. But are they looking for something? Of course they are! Do you really think they care for salsa? They are looking for someone available, dear. How did you get your daughter here? She came with me and later on her father took care of her papers. - Since her father is a Spanish citizen. - Great! And how does one do if one's father doesn't have the citizenship? You have to first arrange your own papers. Sure. That's why I didn't bring my son. But I'm regretting it. Because I don't know when I'm going to see him again. Once you have your papers in order, and have paid taxes for minimum three years, then… - Three years? - Yes, then you can apply for family reunification. - Will I have to wait three years to bring him? - Exactly. You can´t go back to your country neither until you have the papers. But what was your idea when you came here? Did you plan on staying long? I was planing on staying for good. I wanted to come alone and bring him later on. But he will be five by the time he comes… What would happen if you brought him now? Two illegals is not a good idea. One you have your documents and have paid taxes, you can apply for family reunification. You will be able to bring him then, but you need to be stable. Sardinia is the island next to Italy. This is Italy, Sicily, and here are Sardinia and Corsica. - Its beautiful! - Yes, it is. With the beach... It´s bigger. Is the beach bigger? No, Sardinia. So... - Guys. - Thanks. The coffee? It´s for me, thanks. You're welcome. This is for you. And here is the tea. Thank you. So... How long have you been living in Rome? Five years. - Five years? - Yes. Have you had a lot of relationships? Girlfriends? Lots of women? No, I haven´t. I´ve just had two. Two? Sure. One after the other. Exactly. - But there's no one now. - Sure. They were just two, but they lasted long. - Your relationships lasted long? - Yes, they did. That's good. Because I am a little shy. - Are you? - Yes, a little. I'm shy with the girls. But you're not being very shy with me. Right? A little bit. I have had one relationship. And I have a child. I have a son. I am a mother. Oh, are you a mother? Yes, I have a son. Do you want to see a picture? Look. - Very handsome. - Yes, he is. Do you like babies? Do you want to have kids? No, I don't have kids. You don't? But do you want to be a father? I don't know, I have never thought of that. - You haven't. - Nope. Having a baby is really beautiful. Luz? Is it you? - Hi. - Hi, how are you? - Pleased to meet you. - Giacomo... - May I sit down? - Sure. - I'm a little nervous. - Are you? It shows, right? Despite my age, I'm excited. How are you? - Very well. - I´m happy to see you. - And how are you? - I´m good. Did you come here for work? I got here over a week ago. Then I'll have to take you out for a tour in Rome. Rome is pretty, very pretty. So... how is your son? - My son? - What can you tell me about him? Felipe is now in Bogotá with my sister. - Does that mean sister? - Yes, sister. He will stay there until I get a job and can bring him here. How old is he? He's two. Have you said two? - Two. - Twelve? Oh, excuse me… Is he two or twelve? He is one, two. Oh, you have two children! I didn't understand. I'm so sorry, My baby is two years old. One, two years old. He's a baby. - What's his name? - Felipe. Does he look like you? His face… Do you look alike? Felipe and I? Yes, we look alike. And what about his temperament? - Temperament too... - Is he as sweet as you are? He's always laughing. I'm glad to hear that. What would you like to drink? Tea? Coffee? - Tea, please. And you? - A coffee for me. Excuse me. A tea and a coffee, please. Thank you! What do you do for a living? I do different things. In fact I am… maybe you'll find it awkward… I'm a masseur. - What is that? - I do manual lymphatic drainage... for the treatment of cellulite. Masseur… Have you ever tried massage? - No, I haven't. - You haven't? There's always a first time. You can try my magic hands. - Alright... - So I can give you a good massage. I also work as an insurance agent. We do cars and motorbikes. Insurance. Oh, very well. Work is scarce these days. You have to be active. Have you ever flirted with Italians? No, I don't like it. I mean, not only Italians. I like men. That's it. I don't need to flirt because I have my husband with me. On the contrary, they flirt with her. Is it true? I'm fifty years old. Imagine! I don't think I'm up for it. And between Italian or Latino…? Which ones I prefer? Latin Americans here are… - I prefer Italians. - Do you? - What do you say? - I don't. I prefer "my product" so to say. I don't like imported goods. We should try everything. Not eating bread just because is Italian... But anyway... When we are with someone of our country, we enjoy more eating... our rise, our Peruvian stirfry... But Italians would probably ask us what is so special about our food… That's what we are here for. You and I have think differently. I find it good when you get to show your culture to others. Let me ask you something. How do you find that guy? Very handsome. - Show her. - Look. He's hot! Can I borrow him? Ciao bella, how was your day? You tell me later, ok? I'm almost done. Funny! I don't know you and I already miss you. - Hi. - Hi. What's up? All good. Do you speak Spanish? - Yes, I do. - Where are you from? From Chile. From Chile! - What is it? - I'm actually waiting for a Chilean. - Are you? - Yes. Is this a Chilean bar? I hope not. Why? Don't you like Chileans? No, I don't. I do. - Really? - Yes. This one I'm waiting for looks good. He's making me wait, but I'll wait a little longer. - What's your Chilean's name? - Fran. My name is Fran. Is your name Fran? I´m Fran. My Fran? Your Fran. Look at your face. Do you think that what you're doing is alright? I do. Don't you think so? No, I don't like lies. I haven't lied to you. Of course you have. You made think me that you were a man. I didn't tell you that. You thought I was a man. You sent me a picture that wasn't yours. Sure it's mine. I made it. Hi girls. What are you drinking? A beer, please. You? - I don't want anything, thanks. - Don't you like beer? - Yes, I do, but not now… - Two. And…What are you waiting for? Now? The beers. No, I mean, what do you think would happen? Is the first time that this happens to me and I´m feeling a little ackward. I don't know… Drink the beers, have a talk, have a good time… Like before right? Wasn't it alright? Honestly I don't know because I don't know what's true and what's not. I told you I haven't lied to you. Is it true that you lived in Spain? Yes, it is. Is it true you've been in Rome for two weeks? Nearly two weeks. But you know I was expecting a man, right? Sometimes things are not as we expect them. Have you been able to talk to your son? Not yet. Why? When I can call him, he's already asleep. Why don't you call him earlier? It's difficult with the work schedule. I call him from work… I call him in the morning because that's when I can connect to internet. And he's sleeping at that time. Well, here in Rome you can connect from everywhere. For instance, I do it at the library. I would love to talk to him. I haven't been able to do it since I got here. You'll do it, don't worry. I'd love to, but I can't… Don't worry. He's doing fine. He's with your sister, right? Look, I assure you, you'll talk to Felipe. To Felipe! Cheers! Don´t worry. Thanks. Rudi, I forgot my rucksack here the other day. There it is. - What? - I'll take it today. - Is it yours? - Yes. - You are crazy. - Thanks! - What an asshole... - Yes. And you're a little naïve. Well... But do you know something? You'll see that guy again. Do you think so? - I´m totally sure. - I wish... It always happens. It´s a karma thing. What is that? Look, let's sit down here. Here? Yes. Its good, isn't it? - Don't you know what karma is? - Nope. It´s like "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth", If someone does something to you, it goes doubly around to that person. So sooner or later you'll be face to face... and he'll have to pay you back. - It's always like that. - It would be fair. I hope so, I'd love that. - Look what I have... - What is that? Drink. What do you have in there? Everything I need is here. You've drank enough. I'm almost done. I can't do it. Besides, You'll see that guy again because Rome is a village. Rome is a village? Is a village to me. Don't laugh! Is a village full of scum. I don't like it because of it. Don´t you? I´m going to leave as soon as I get the chance. Where do you want to go? I´m going to Thailand. Thailand? Why? What is there in Thailand? Its exactly the opposite of this place. Everything flows there, you know? Everything is more spiritual... Its a different thing. Have you been to Thailand before? No, I haven't, but... I know what's in there. - Of course! - It´s different. Besides, people there don't live just to work. That´s what I hate from here. You're like a slave. So you are going to Thailand because you don't want to work... It´s not like that. I just don't want to work like a slave. But you'll have to work, won't you? Ok. But I´ll work in whatever is necessary to live. - Do you know what I mean? - Like what? If I want to eat, for instance, I can fish. There're thousands of beaches. But why are you laughing? Have you a rod in your bag? Don't you know there are places where you can have that life? You need to see the world. - Do you think so? - Definitely. How are you going back? What do you mean? How are you getting home? I think I'll take the bus. I don't know where to take it. Do you? It's close by. Wait! What are you doing? Do you want to see the sunrise? I know a place… I can't. I have to work tomorrow. Silence! - Which one is your bed? - This one. It's really small, like a nun's bed… Where do you live Fran? I live with some friends. So you don't live in a shared dorm. No, I don´t. It's not good to say we live in one. Ours is really ugly. - I know it, I don't live in a dorm. - Alright. - Is this the train? - Yes, this one. - Over there. Good. Once you've finished, you spray some air freshener. Some perfume. No, this is air freshener. Perfect. Very well. Okay After this you need to change the garbage bin downstairs. Good. See you later. They take advantage because she's illegal. But the training period should be paid because you're working normally. It´s not like she's just looking and learning. - Hi! - Hi! That doesn't worry me now because I'm learning fast, so I'll get paid soon. What worries me are the papers. Talk to the director. - Should I? - Of course! Talk to her. She's already seen how you work. I think the girls that trained me have talked well about me to her. Yes, don't lose that contact. You have to talk to her as soon as the contract comes. She should give it to you. I didn't know anything, they really had to teach me. Anyway, we all have learnt... You may not smoke in here. Not because of us, it's the law. You may not smoke in closed spaces. Whatever. So, how did it go with the practice? Did you like it? Didn't you like it? Well... Cleaning... What did you have to clean? An office and a lounge. Did you do it well? Cleaning? Sure. Where did you use to work? Where? Before, in your country. I worked with friends of mine. - You´ve never worked as a cleaner before. - No. You have to get used to it here. You have no choice. You have to. You have to pay attention. Your side looks longer. Ok, it's better now. Now we do this side again. Like this, otherwise… Now it´s done. Right? What are you doing here? How long until we finish? I don't know… a couple of hours. What happened? What did you do? Everything. I haven't stopped. That's exploitation. Well, It's my job. Besides, they can give me my papers. I don't care about that. I'm moving to Thailand. I have to finish. So, Luz... This is your pay. The days you were learning are not included. - Thank you. - Thank you. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. - Everything ok? - Ok. Do you need anything? You are going to pay me, right? - What do you mean? - Today´s money. Luz, maybe I haven't been totally clear… Are you going to pay me for what I´ve worked today? - There´s a period that we usually... - What? Translate for her. A period in which we teach you... Teach? I learned by the time I made my first bed… The rest is work. You have to pay me that. I don't understand you… How many beds do I have to do to learn? 500? Fran, I'm talking to you. Look at me. You're not going to get paid because the first day isn't paid. You´re not paying me then? - No. - No, she won´t. Alright. Luz, I think there was a misunderstanding. No, there wasn't. I explained it to her… What are you doing? Please stop! Give it to me. We're not coming back here. Otherwise I cannot go back to work. - Who cares? - I care! This is shit. You're worth much more than this. But I don't have anything else. Why do you get the first thing you find? Do you like it? Do you want to buy it? How much? 20? - How much? - 20? It´s cheap! I'm going to sell it. You're not. I bet you I will. I bet you won't. But it works fine. It even has the wire. But it doesn't have the box… You can use my slippers if you want. No, don´t worry. Luz, can we talk for a moment? - Hi Giulia. - Hi. She? She's my friend Fran. Fran, come over here! Hi. This is Giulia, she's the owner. Is she the same from yesterday? What? Is she person who was with you here? Last night? Yes, actually she came with me this morning. We stayed one hour and left again. I see, but you didn't let me know and you know the rules… Everybody complained. You have caused a big problem. I haven't caused any problem. We're staying for a bit and we go. She's not staying. Yes, but you've made a lot of noise last night. I don't want to kick you out. I want you to stay, ok? But you know you cannot bring anyone here. You cannot have visitors. Visitors have to pay. You haven't even paid me yet. I want to pay you. You have to pay me by Monday. But I don't have my money. I've called Ricardo all week; he doesn't pick up the phone. No one knows where Ricardo is. If I don't find Ricardo, I won't have my money. Without the money, I can't pay you. That is not my responsibility. You gave him your money... - Yes, it is your responsibility! - What? Because you run this place... and if someone steals her money, who is in charge then? Look, I don't understand you. Perhaps you don't know she gave her money... to a total stranger. Is it my problem? You haven't been willing to help me. I asked you to call Ricardo, so I can get my money back. Give her back her money, it's simple. Calm down. There's no screaming in here. Other people live here. So now this is a very decent house? It´s a very decent house for everybody. People who stay here and pay have the right to be undisturbed. You've made a big fuss. I want to pay, but I don´t have my money... Beacuse you both have stolen her. I have nothing! - Give her back her money. - Calm down. Why is she speaking for you? I don't understand you. - Ah, "non capito", now "non capito"… I don't have her money. And you haven't paid me yet. - Who is that? - I don't know. - This one has messaged to me. - Really? I didn't answer. Disgusting. This one must be bald, poor thing! - This one is great! Write him! - Really? Please, message to him. - Seriously? - Yes. Who is it? Pino? Yes. It´s me, Luz. Yes, last door at the back, first floor. What? - Hi. - Hi. Hi, Pino. - Luz? - Yes. - You bring company... - She´s my sister. - Oh, your sister. Hi. - Hi. - Can she stay with us? - Of course! Come in. So, you're from Colombia… Yes, we both are from Colombia. They just speak Spanish there, right? Yes, only Spanish. I only speak Italian. I don't speak Italian. Nothing? Nothing... and good morning, hello, thanks... It's something! I watched a documentary about Peru on TV the other day. - On TV? You watched Peru on TV? - Yes, I did. It was about Peru. I think it´s close to you. - Close to Colombia... - Yes, it is. Peru, Colombia, Ecuador… I see... - Do you live here by yourself? - Yes, I do. You have a beautiful house. I don't live bad here. I haven't offered you anything. Do you want a coffee? - Coffee? - Yes, please! - I'll go get it. - Thank you. Here is the coffee. Thanks. So, you're sisters... - Yes. - You look very alike. - What? - You are very similar. How much sugar? One... I do! Do you have internet? Sure, I have internet. I´m going to show you something. Go ahead. Here is your coffee. How much sugar? Nothing. I'll also take one. You're both very pretty. Pretty. Let's see… Here. It´s so fun. Why? Honestly, I don´t get it. Thanks. I want to go. Let´s go. Is it possible? Cheers! Cheers! I'm "raja". What's that? I'm tired. Me too. What are you doing? Nothing. Do you have internet? No... Don't you want to sleep a little longer? I can't. Come! - Do you want? - What? - Do you want, Luz? - No, I don´t. - Do you, Fran? - Yes. - Why don't you do it? - What? - Why don't you do it? - What? Cocaine. No, no cocaine for me. Alright? This one! Come on... I´m in charge. What's that? Fran? Taxi! This one, this one... So? What's wrong with you? Sorry? - Are you ok? - Yes, all good. - Do you smoke? - Of course. How are you feeling? - You are drunk. - What? A little. Aren´t you? - What? - A little drunk. And you? Why are you mad? You don't speak… - What? - You don't speak, don't follow.. Why are you so negative? Why is she mad? How's that? - What? - Aren't you having fun? Yes... Definitely... Why don't you smile? I'm talking to you. Why doesn´t she speak? Does she understand me? Smile! You're being very uptight. Smile! Do you get it? - Do you want me to laugh? - Yes, I do. - Do you? - Yes! You're in a bad mood. Like this? She's crazy. Completely. This is for me. Shall we go? Are you tired? Do you want to sleep? What do we do? What are you doing there? Come here! He's calling me. What should I do? You decide. Come here, Luz. I don't know… you tell me. Should I go? Do what you have to do. Come with me, Luz. Of course. No, this doesn't work like this. Because you twist things to your convenience. Don´t you? You've been working with me for five years. I'm listening. Let it come. Why? Who is it? No, I don't like this. Wait a second. Girls, I have to leave. - Are you there? - Yes. You can have a shower and eat something… but you need to leave when you're done. - Ok? - Yes. - Ok? - Yes, we will. Ciao, see you. I wasn't talking to you. In fact, I'm angry with you. Look! How wonderful! We walked up there yesterday. I don't remember… I don't think this is the right way. I think we have to go back. Yes… I don't know. I think so. Shall we? - Relax! What's the hurry? - Nothing. Why? I don´t know. I'm just saying... don't we have to pick up our stuff? Our stuff won't run away. Do you have a date? What is it? You're stupid… I don´t. So? What do you want to do? What are you thinking about? Nothing. Nothing? I don´t know. What are you thinking about? I was thinking… that I never had a friend like you before. Are we friends? I don´t know. What do you think? We're more than friends. But this is going to end... when you leave, won't it? You're also leaving. Where to? Thailand? - Yes. - Really? What makes you think I'm coming with you? Why do you think we ended up here together? This is not a coincidence. But I have Felipe. We´ll take him. Would you like that? The three of us in Thailand? I don´t know. - Do you think he would like that? - Of course! Just imagine… the beaches, the animals… He loves animals. What if that guy comes back? What? He cannot find us here. Why not? Because this is his house. When he's back we go. Do you care what he thinks? Not at all. Screw him! He invited us here. When he comes, we go. Where are we going first? We need to get to Bangkok first. Is that the capital? There is where everything happens. I've got a couple of contacts there. And after that... we move to an island. Isn't Bangkok nice? Is not convenient to spend too much time there. We better go to a beach. We need to buy the tickets, right? Of course. With what money? We'll have to save some. Are they expensive? It depends. But we'll see when the time comes. And what do we do when we get there? Don't you worry about that. I've learned that you shouldn't worry so much in life. You have to do instead. So we're not going to waste time worrying about future problems. We´ll see. Do you trust me or not? Alright. I'm just curious because I don't know how it is there. - Hi! - Hi! How are you? - I'm well. Can you hear me? - Yes. perfectly. Ok. How are you, Luz? I'm very well. What are you doing? I'm on the way out. Felipe is sleeping. And I'm in a bit of a hurry. You? I don't bother you then. I just wanted to say hi... and tell you that I'm happy. How good to hear. - You're looking good. - Am I? Truth is, I've met someone. That explains it! Yes. And? I'll give you all the details when you have more time. It's me! Are you alright? Fuck... Good morning. Hi. This is for you. Thanks. Don't you want it? I'm not hungry. Later I'll eat it. You haven't slept very well. Yes, I did. You scared me when I came into the room. How so? You started screaming madly. - Really? - Yes. I might have been dreaming. What were you dreaming? I don't remember. Your eyes were open. Really? Yes. You scared me. I don't remember. Are you alright, though? Yes, I am. Hello? Hello? Luz? Hello, sister. Hello? Luz? Can you hear me? Sister? Sister! Luz? Can you hear me? Mushrooms? Yes. To drink? I want... beer. No... Five. Tell me what you´ve done to my sister. What do you mean? Tell me what you did. I don't even know your sister! You answered her call. It was for me. You let her speak to the phone and didn't respond. What are you laughing about? Was she your sister? It was a joke! It's not funny. Don't you pick on her. Why are you taking everything so personal? Because It's my family. Oh yes, the family… Fran, family is sacred to me. Family is shit to me. Well, not to me. Who is talking about you? What are we talking about? I'm talking about my family. What's wrong with your family now? They are shit. They turned the back to me. I don't want to know anything about them. You shouldn't be so resentful. You have to relax… Why the hell do you tell me how I should feel towards them? You won't get anywhere with that hatred inside of you. You've got to learn how to interact... I was sent to jail! And they just disappeared on me. Have you been to jail? Sure. Really? Don't you believe me? Will you forgive me? There´s nothing to forgive. I didn't know it. Otherwise I wouldn't have talked like that. That's because we only talk about you. You're exaggerating. You have to tell me everything. Deal? I love you, Fran. [The Objects of Love] Can you hear me? - Yes, I can. - Hi, how are you? Good, how have you been? Good. What's Felipe doing? He's playing. He's really grown! Can you put him on? You're breaking up… (faltering voice) What? Hello! Hi my darling boy. Would you send me a kiss? Hello! (faltering voice) Is he ok? Is he eating well? He's eating very well... Does he ask about me? Of course. He asks all the time… I can't hear you very well. He asks at night. I show him your pictures every day. - Perfect. - Don't be sad. He's doing well. - Ok. - Look! Come here! Tell her "I love you". He's not looking at me. Don't worry... Hello! He's distracted, playing with his toys. - You know how kids are. - Yes. But he asks about you all the time. Thanks a lot. Is he sleeping well? Very well. He hasn't forgotten about you. Can you hear me? (faltering voice) Can you hear me or not? We have to go. Why? What happened? It makes no sense to stay here anymore. We're not doing anything. We're better in here than out there. No, I'm not well. I want to go out. Let's do something. Let's look for a job. Alright. Where do we go? Where do you want to go? Do you want to go to the dorm? Do you want to be stolen again? You know we can´t... Ok, then let's go to the hotel to clean shit. Do you want to go there again? We can´t go back there. If we're ok in here, then why should we leave? Because we're not doing anything. We'll have to leave anyway. The plan was to leave when this guy comes back. He hasn't returned, so we stay a little longer. I'm telling you I'm not doing well! I've got to do something! I´ve got to find a job! What are you getting to hysterical about? Relax! You're not listening to me! I've got to go, Fran. Ok, then go! I can't stop you. If you want to go, then go. Do you want me to go? - Good morning. - Good morning. Who else is in the house? Tell me! Don't you shout at me. I am in my house and I shout if I want. Look at the mess... - Keep your voice down. - Get out of my house! - Don't you touch me! - Get out! Now! Out! Both of you! Out! Come on! Yes, do you have our luggage? Yes. We had a problem and we couldn't come earlier. I'll give them to you... Thanks. Search everywhere. Ok. Hi guys! I'm selling my art. Hi gentlemen! I'm doing some portraits… Hi guys! Can I draw your face? No, thanks. I have other things; still life, landscapes… No, thanks. A souvenir from Rome with the three of you? No. thanks. Bye! Hi gentlemen! Do you want your portrait done? Hi guys! I'm selling my art... my drawings... No, thanks. Do you speak Spanish? Yes, a little. We only need five euros to pay a hostel tonight. If you have anything… They´re asking for money. Are you eating that? No. - May I? - Sure. Excuse me. Excuse me! You cannot stay here. I'm sorry. It´s ok. I don´t know... How long are you going to pull that face? Which face? That face you're pulling… it doesn't help me. I've done everything so far. What have you done? Everything. So far. Can you see where we are? That's what I mean. You need to change your attitude to get ahead. I knew it. What? What did you say? I knew we were going to end up like this. You're so wise, right? You smartass… Do you know what's going to happen now? Tell me! You know what? What? I missed my period. What? I should've gotten it last week. What are you going to do? I don't know. We have to talk. We? I have nothing to do with this! Of course you have! This happened to you. No, we're together in this, so it's happened to you as well. And I want to know what you think. What can I think? I have nothing to say. I can go with you to the hospital tomorrow. For what? For what? What do you think? Do you want to have another child? - I don't know. - Don´t you? I think it'd be a good thing for us. Good? Good for what? For us. I think it could be an opportunity. Your head is not well... I know you can´t see it now, but… I think this happened for a reason. Of course it has. Look! The same one from last time. Get up! You cannot stay here. You have to leave right now. Hurry up! Come on! - Me. - Come in. Yes. - Get ready, you're next. - Thanks. Are you sure? Have you taken a test? Yes, I have. One from the pharmacy. Does it work? More or less. It's not very reliable. It's better to do a blood test. Ok. You want to have a abortion during your second week… so we can do it without surgery. It´s not invasive. It won't harm you. Just taking pills. Just with pills? Yes, you have to take some pills. You take first three pills at once. And after that another three. And where do we get them? Here. We give them to you. How much? It´s free. They're provided by the national health system. So you don't need to worry. If you agree, here´s the form... you have to fill in it... and sign it. You have to come back in seven days... to take the blood test. To make sure that you… She's sure. She doesn't need to think about it. Yes, but the law... requires me to hand out this form to her. She has to come back in seven days. - How long? - Seven days. By law. There's lots of people. We can make some money. Why don´t we go to sell some drawings? I'm not going. Well. You stay here and I'll try. If you want, I can draw your face. Your portrait. No, thanks. Do you like art? I can draw your face. Bye. Ok. Do you have some money? Then became a party... Do you want your portrait? This is Belcebu. Not like Belcebu. I can draw it more handsome. Like you. - Me handsome? I'm ugly… - For some money. You're much more beautiful. - It´s ok... - Can I draw you? Look, let's talk to them. They were owners of a large state... Now listen, look. Owners of a large state... We´re talking about Rigo Berlinguero, here in Italy... Serious and competent... Can I draw you? I cut my hair like that two years ago. What a surprise! - How are you? - What are you doing here? I came not long ago. What do you mean not long ago? I'm fine! But... What a surprise! It's been ages! I'm very happy to see you. Why are you crying? What happened? I have so much to tell you... You are in such a delicate situation. I don't know… You could stay at my place for some days. Most important is that you have a place to stay, right? Where do you live? I don't live here. I live next to Naples. Where is Naples? Naples is two hours from Rome. I guess you could come over for some days. I live there with my husband and his parents. I wouldn't like to intrude. No, that´s not a big deal. The house is big, my family is easy-going… - Really? - Yes, because... you cannot stay like this... and neither can you. From here to there. Especially you… No. The more time passes, the worse. Whatever you do is your decision. I can offer you this for now. Are you hungry? No. I'm sure that Diana has bought lots of yummy stuff. She loves cooking. I think we're going to be alright. Don't you? What is it? Are you ok? Yes. Do you need much longer? I think we should go. Let's go. I´m not going. What do you mean? I´m not going. I´m going. I´m not going to stay here. Go. Fran, let's go. We have to leave now. Go.
