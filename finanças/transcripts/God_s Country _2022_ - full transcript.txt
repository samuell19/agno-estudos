Hey. Here you go. Here ya go. Sometimes it feels like things never change. But I promise you. They do. They have to. And I'm not saying it's easy. Change comes with feelings of loss. And... We might feel resistance. Like there's so much in the world that needs changing. Where am I supposed to start? Right? When you feel that way, that is the moment to begin work. On whatever fires you up, you just start chipping away. And if you look around this room, you'll see that you're not alone. Don't ever feel like there's nothing you can do. Please. That's my wish for you. And now you've taken this class I know you won't be afraid to use your words. All right. That's all I've got. You have 90 minutes. Make me proud. Well done. Uh, Professor Guidry, I just wanted to say thank you for dealing with my crazy schedule. Gretchen, that is so sweet of you, but you're the one who made it work. I wish you had another class I could take. I like teaching the basics. As the popular aphorism goes, "Those who can't do teach," and those-- those who can't teach become deans, 'nother conversation. George has played a critical role in building the culture of this department over the years and we have all benefited from his wisdom and we have had our spirits lifted by his good humor. And man, on a-- on a more personal note, I am just humbled and grateful to call you a colleague, a mentor and a fishing buddy. Seriously, folks, this guy can cast a fly. I have seen him get a rise out of a brown trout in one foot of stillwater, I am not kidding you. Anyway, I've embarrassed the man enough. To George. Thanks, man. It's gonna be hard to fill your shoes, George. Tell ya that much. Hey, Arthur. Sandra, how ya holdin' up? You doin' okay? - I'm good, I'm good. - Yeah. I didn't want to put you on the spot in the meeting, but my sincere condolences. I'm just glad that she's not suffering anymore. Yeah. Yeah. She's in a better place now. I-- I-- I did have a quick question. Yeah. Okay, well, walk with me, 'cause I got to get home. Hey, Gretchen, can you find a tote bag for some of this stuff? Did you see a red truck this morning? I see a red truck every time I open my eyes, it's practically the state car. - Hey, Todd. - Nice holiday. See ya, merry Christmas. I mean, in the canyon. It was parked in my driveway. Probably hunters, right? I don't know. Um... You know, Susan lost her mom a few years back. It-- it brings up all of the unresolved shit. Takes time. Just go easy on yourself. Okay? Yeah, you're probably right. And I expect to see you at the Christmas party! There's gonna be eggnog! Come on! C'mon, baby. - Morning, ma'am. - Good morning to you. It's a prime spot you got here. Hey, we just figured we'd walk up into the woods. We won't be any trouble for ya. We'll stay out of your hair. You must have got my note, though. I put it on your truck yesterday. That's the first I heard of any note. What-- What did it say? It said I'd prefer you not park here. Uh-huh. It's just there's not a lot of good jumping off points around here. You could always come in from the other side. The other side? How far is that? About 15 miles. Fifteen miles. Ma'am, we're not gonna put a bullet in anyone's house or shoot anybody's cow. I didn't think you were. Yeah, but you're telling me you want us to walk 15 miles in the snow. That's not what I said and I'm not telling you to do anything. All I'm saying is before you park on someone's property, you have to ask. I heard about you. Just didn't know it was this canyon. - All right. - Forget about her. Get in the truck. Too much. Look, obviously, nobody objects to the basic concept. I just think, first and foremost, we need to look at cold, hard qualifications. So, like we said, in the beginning, our job is to present the three best candidates to the dean. Period. Well, I guess I'm just confused about what we mean by best. I don't think we should be trying to fill some kind of quota. Oh, course not. No one is forcing our hand. These are just factors we should consider among many others. Um, did anyone else want to chime in? Yes. Faith, you have a comment? To me, learning is about asking questions and challenging yourself. Over the years, some of my very best students have been Indians from the reservation because they bring this whole other experience into class. I think we could all stand to listen more and learn more from people who don't have the same perspective as us. You can call it diversity. I don't know. It just seems like the right thing to do to bring in different sorts of people when we can, rather than doing the same old thing we've been doing. I think your point's very well taken, Faith. Let's make it a priority. Um... all right. Ma'am, would you mind spelling your last name for me? G-U-I-D-R-Y. Cassandra Guidry. That's a name. Where you from originally? New Orleans. New Orleans. What do they call that, uh... -Uh-- -The Big Easy. The Big Easy. That's right. I was getting there. There's a lot of history down there, you know? You work in town? I teach at the university. Is that right? What subject you teach? I'm sorry. Is this relevant? Yeah. Sorry. Um, you said your first direct contact-- your only direct contact with them was in the driveway when they're trying to park? Two days ago. That's correct. Okay. And, uh, did they threaten you at all that time? Not overtly, but I have definitely been made to feel threatened. Okay. Um... Ms. Guidry. City environment, you catch somebody on your property, that's a bad thing, so you contact law enforcement, right? Out here, things are a little different. And people, generally, they tend to handle this sort of thing amongst themselves. You know, you let the small things go to avoid a bigger problem down the road-- Officer, they shot an arrow into my door. I understand that, but you did tow their truck. Perhaps I should not have done that, but I was well within my rights. Oh, of course you were. Of course. But you can see how that sort of thing, you know, might upset a person. And I've got to warn you, that these two gentlemen, they are likely to see you're involving the local sheriff's department as yet another escalation. Why do you keep calling them gentlemen? Did you happen to catch their license plate? 2-3-8-3-9-5. And why did you collect all of this, exactly? I mean, most folks, they wouldn't think to keep all of this stuff. I guess I'm not most folks. Yeah. So... Well, thank you for your time. So, what happens now? Well, I've got a pretty good idea who these boys are, so I work with them, see if I can't straighten this out. Great. I'll get my coat. Ma'am, there's really no need for you to come along. Hello. How's it going in here, today? What is she doing here, Gus? -Lady, what is your problem-- -Hey, hey, hey Let's just relax here, okay? There's no need for you to talk to her. You just talk to me. Keep it civil. We're gonna do this right now, Gus? This is honest work I'm doing here. You're gonna get me fired. I'm not gonna get you fired. I promise. Okay? It seems you boys put an arrow in her door last night. Is that right? No, I don't know anything about that. Did she tell you that she damn near broke my fucking axle? Hey, let's just relax. Okay? She's pretty up front with you. She doesn't want you on her property. You got to respect that, all right? That's pretty funny. You talking about respect, Sheriff. I'm not the sheriff and you know that. I'm the acting sheriff. All right, shit, man. -Can we wrap this up? -Yeah, we can wrap it up. You stay off her goddamn property. You find someplace else to hunt. Is that clear? No, you gotta say it. -Yep. -Yeah, what? -Yeah, we're clear. -Great. Cool. Now, where can I find your brother? ♪ Dashing through the snow ♪ ♪ In a one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ O'er the fields we go ♪ ♪ Laughing all the way ♪ ♪ What fun it is to ride and sing ♪ ♪ A sleighing song tonight ♪ ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way ♪ Not what I was expecting. Look, I can't stop you from tagging along, but I'm not here to chit chat, okay? Should we call for backup? What backup? We've got two officers to cover 300 square miles and one of them's currently on administrative leave. So that leaves me. What happened to the other one? What'd I say about chit chat? What? How we doin'? Do me a favor. Take your mask down, I like to see who I'm talking to. Do you hear me, son? Behind you. Afternoon, gentlemen. Now, I'm not here to arrest anybody. Just need to have a word with one of you boys. What's the deal, guys? I know you can hear me. Okay. Everybody step forward! You put your saws down, you take your masks off! Or what? You're gonna shoot us, Wolf? Nobody's shooting anybody. Yeah. Why don't you tell that to my cousin. I didn't shoot your cousin-- Your piece of shit boss did. Now he's collecting hazard pay with his feet kicked up. My cousin got a hole in his back-- All right, I'm done talking! Take your masks off right now! Why the fuck would we do that? Because I told you to, that's why-- - Fuck you, Wolf. - Fuck you. Everybody better calm down! Yo, why you open your holster? I'm not gonna ask you again. Why did you open your fucking holster? Dougie, goddamn it, I know you. I know your family. -I don't wanna hurt-- -You wanna kill us too, pig? -Fuck you-- -Back the fuck up and put-- Hey, hey! Who the fuck are you? You're angry about your cousin. I'd be angry, too. And whoever did it should be brought to justice. How is that gonna happen if it was the fuckin' sheriff who pulled the trigger? Especially if it was the fuckin' sheriff... right? We all gotta play by the same rules if this is gonna work. Where is the sheriff, right now? Probably Florida or something, tanning his pasty ass. Right. But he's not here. No one here was involved with your cousin's shooting. Correct? Okay. Now, we'll get out of your way. There's no harm done. And I'm sorry for your family. Well, that was a big success. Really glad you came along today. I told you that around here, contacting authorities only makes things worse. Then what is the point of you? What exactly do you do? Yeah, why don't you tell me how to do my job? That'd be great. I don't feel safe in my own house. I should be able to call the police and have the confidence that my concerns will be addressed. Ma'am, there isn't enough law in this whole state to make you feel safe. Now, you want to live out in the middle of a canyon, you're on your own. And if you can't handle that, I hear they're putting up some nice condos over by the college. Or you could go back to The Big Easy. Hello? Arthur. It's Sandra. Sandra, it's 6:00 in the morning. You've got two guys in your yard trying to get on my property. Oh. What? What-- What guys, what are you talking about? The hunters. I wouldn't let them into the canyon, so they climbed your fence. So, what do you want me to do about it? There's guys with guns walking by your back door without permission. Oh, good. Okay, look, I'll talk to them when I see them. I-- Im sure they're harmless. We get hunters up here all the time. I've never had an issue. It's not about the hunting. These guys keep coming back. Why do you think that is? I don't-- I don't know, Sandra. Why do you care so much? Go back to sleep. Smells like a deer, shit's like a deer, - it's a fucking deer. - Shut up. Up there for a couple hours, she'll walk right past us. The fuck are you doing here? Are you following me around? You trying to make some kind of point? Is that your mother? Yes. Yeah, what of it? My mother was an organist. In our church back in New Orleans. She used to play this. She did? "Beautiful Savior." Please, be seated. God is good. All the time. God is good. Brothers and sisters, let us open to Matthew, Chapter six, verse 25. "Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink or about your body. What you will wear. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothes?" You believe in this stuff? I did, once. Yeah. Come here for her. Make her happy. Yeah. I know all about that. She put up with a lot of shit in her life. She got used to being unhappy. Yeah. Yeah. My mother had that. She never forgave me for bringing her up here. She hated the cold. Everyone hates the cold. I wish she could hear you say that. My mother was never content. She'd hold onto stuff that happened 20 years ago, like it happened yesterday. Everything was a battle. I wonder sometimes. Why do you choose to be the person you are? Like, you're just Whatever happened before you. Maybe it takes some kind of sacrifice to break the cycle. - Amen. - Amen.

Oh hey, Gretchen. You okay? Come in, come in. So, um... - I wanted to ask you something. - Mm-hm. You know how you mentioned the T.A. thing? Well, um... I'd like to take you up on that. I mean, if it's still available. Yeah, of course. As long as it's alright with Arthur. Oh, I'm sure he has plenty of other people. Did something change? If I tell you, you have to promise you won't say anything. Tell me what? Last night after the party, he-- ...uh... He came into the study. I was grading papers. He said he'd pulled a muscle carrying firewood. He was sore and he couldn't sleep. He had some lotion and he wanted me to put it on for him, so-- so I did. Did he touch you? I put the lotion on the shoulders for him and that was it. Gretchen, you do not have to accept this. I mean, I agreed to do it. It wasn't a big deal. We don't have to talk about this anymore, I just, uh... I'd just rather T.A. for you now. Yeah. Uh, all those in favor? Okay. Opposed? Professor Guidry, again. Well, folks. Looks like we have our top three. Congratulations. Well done. I don't mean to be difficult but we all agreed it was important for the future of our department to try to be more inclusive. Uh, I think we did try. And now that we have our list, it's important that we all rally behind it. I've seen the Dean use the budget to stall appointments if he senses discord. And we have three fine candidates here who could really grow with our department. So, let's... let's not blow this opportunity. And on that note, Merry Christmas, everyone. God bless. And, um, hey, see you all next year. Yeah. Well, once we-- Once-- I think it's up to the... Excuse me for one second. I thought we said that we would try to recommend at least one person of color to the dean. On the contrary, we explicitly said that this was not about filling a quota. That's not what I'm saying. You literally just said that-- No, no, you're not listening to me. No, I'm pretty sure you understand the concept of-- I said that we should try to recommend. Not hire, recommend. That's all. One name on a list of three, and we can't do that? So, a quota. We had options, Arthur. And we agreed it was important. -You said that. Right? -Yes. I don't know where you're going with this, Sandra. I'm trying to remind you-- I'm 100% confident that we considered everyone-- I'm trying to express what we agreed-- Sandra, this is not about you. Oh, I know this is not about me. This is about hiring the best person for the job. Period. But if everyone on the list is white, -then how are we supposed to-- -Sandra. It's over. The process was fair! Now it's over and we are moving on. I will not allow the dean to cut this department to ribbons because we got distracted by identity politics. -Identity politics? -Yeah. Not on my watch. And quite frankly, I take great offense that you're reading -some kind of bias into this. -This is how it happens. Right here is how it all breaks down-- You know what, spare me-- It's this whole big song and dance about the process-- And now you're mad that you didn't get what you wanted. We say we care about right and wrong-- -How dare you? -But in the end, it's really just about winning, isn't it? You're here. We hired you, didn't we? Huh? How's your back, Arthur? I hear you pulled a muscle. Think you need to take some time to yourself, maybe take the next term off! Go see a shrink! She's having a hard time, you know? She just-- she lost her mom recently, so... Gretchen. Come on. We're going to the Dean. We have to go right now. What? What are you talking... We cannot let them get away with this. Not anymore. We have to fight back every time. All the time or this is going to go on forever. Did you say something? What did you say? I didn't say your name. I thought you understood how hard I worked to get here. Gretchen. I-- Believe me, I do. But you have a right to be angry. And you shouldn't punish yourself for something that's not your fault. Is that what you think I'm doing? Ladies, everything all right? I'm so... Sorry. I need to apologize for my behavior. What I said was completely out of line. And you're right. I should probably take some time off. Hey, fellas! How'd you do? Look at this man, you fuckin' tell me! Jesus fucking Christ. What do you think you're doing? Sandra? Unbelievable. This is my property. Sandra, come on. Sandra. Jesus. Hey! Sandra! Yeah,you feel big now? You massacre at tiny baby deer and you're such a big man. Just mind your own goddamn business. Yeah, I'd kinda like to do the mama, too. 'Kay, you know what, Sandra? I really need you -to walk away right now-- -Oh, shut the fuck up! Yeah, shut the fuck up, huh? I'm tired. I'm so tired of you. You know, she came to my house the other day, too. Did I tell you that? Come back anytime, baby. You come back here again, I'll fucking kill you. I swear to God, I'll fucking kill you.
