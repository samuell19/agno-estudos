Directed by Isshin Inudo Screenplay by Hiroshi Saito & Isshin Inudo An abandoned dog. A slightly timid boy. This story begins with their encounter. The title is "HAW." What does "HAW" mean? Watch and you'll understand. This may come as a shock after all this time... but I long had a bigger crush on Yoshida than on you. Okay... But then he went and married Keiko. But lucky for me... he just got divorced. So can we end this? Wait, what? What about our wedding? Let's both look forward. Wait! Marina! That's Tamio Akanishi, age 34. This was his worst day ever. He couldn't utter a word, despite overflowing with things to say. So all of those words just slowly sunk to the bottom of Tamio's heart. "You're canceling the wedding hall?" Yes, please. I will deposit the cancellation fee. "Good gracious, Tamio." "You took out a mortgage for how long?" 40 years. Please stop sighing, Mom. Even on the hardest mornings, one still must go to work. That is being an adult. Ms. Suzuki, good morning. Morning. Isn't she your staff? Just a little more. Miss Adachi? Are you feverish? No. I just fell off the bench. Show's over. Oh, good morning. It's Adachi. "Kita Ward City Hall" "Really? Not again." You stopped again to help a homeless, I mean "housing distressed," person? I'm not blaming you for it, but this is becoming a habit. Okay, I won't mark you as late. Thank you. Chief, may I speak to you? What a sour face. But that's how he always looks. Seriously? You've been abandoned? I wasn't exactly "abandoned." She broke up with me. When did that happen? Yesterday. Nope. It'll kill me to keep that secret. Listen up, everyone within earshot. Akanishi's wedding has been called off. So don't congratulate him, okay? There. Is there a problem? No, it's fine. Next in line, please. Excuse me. We'd like to register our marriage. Here's the form. Congratulations. Please wait while I check the contents. Do you have any identification with you? Thank you. Thanks for coming at my request. Not at all. You have a beautiful garden. Reiko's father is a local landlord. Come. Come. Here you are. Congratulations on getting a new papa. Oh, she runs a dog and cat shelter. He's a very well-behaved dog. I trained him. Down! The poor thing has had it rough. In short, he was abandoned. Oh, I mean "left behind." I guess it's the same thing. I got him from the city, and put him up for adoption many times. Everyone finds him adorable at first sight. Until they hear the rest. The rest? His former owner had his vocal chords removed... rather than training him not to bark. How cruel. No, I didn't mean... You'd be perfect. I know your character. And you're a homeowner. We couldn't ask for better. And I'll offer any support you need. You're a lock to pass the test. I don't know. I don't know. Wait. Get back here. Stay still. Hey, be careful! Wait up. "Know your dog. Know its feelings." "Take me for a walk!" Easy easy! And so Tamio and the dog met... whether by pure chance or by destiny. Either way, Tamio gave it his all. Be gentle but thorough in washing. You want to scrub hard enough to wash out dirt and any smell. If only you could play shogi. I was ranked at 2-dan. Only as an amateur, of course. I once dreamed of turning pro and doing nothing but playing it... until the first time I was outmatched. So I settled for ordinary. And that's what led me to now. What? Are you trying to cheer me up? "New message from Reiko Nabeshima." "Have you named your dog yet?" "I've decided to name him 'Haw'." "Yes, please bring a photo I.D." Yes, we're open at noon. Feel free to come by anytime. Excuse me. Miss Adachi, it's 5 o'clock. You may go. Thanks for waiting. What, you again? How've you been? Look how oddly cheerful he's become. He replaced a wife with a dog. But it's a male dog. A male, huh? Haw, I'm back! "No trespassing" Wait, let me open it. Here you go. Not so fast. I can't keep up. Ready? Fetch! Nice! Bring it back. Haw, fetch this one. "Okay, hurry back." Nice catch, Haw. Let's give it another go. "I'm tossing this one far." On social media, Tamio took the user name of "Haw Papa." "Autumn leaves and Haw" "Snow pup and Haw" His followers were in the 200s, but never increased. But Tamio didn't care about that. "Haw and Cherry Blossoms" Being with Haw became a given for Tamio, and he was grateful. Good one, Haw! Way to go, Haw. Come here. Come here, Haw. Sit. Sit, sit. Let's play ball! Haw? Haw! "Sunny Side Dog & Cat Shelter" These are all the shelter friends I could gather today. I'm so sorry for the trouble. Don't be. Haw is our dog, too. That's a given. Thank you. Okay. Here. Please take these. Over there. Let's do Block 3 next. "Have you seen this dog?" "Help me find Haw!" I'm looking for my dog, Haw. What kind is he? How big is he? Your size. Large dogs stand out. I'm sure someone is caring for him. "We always find them. Don't worry." We're looking of a dog named Haw. There's a camera. Let's ask. This is the oldest you have? Your total is 8,900 yen. "Mitsuzawa Animal Protection Center" A week passed with no leads whatsoever. Dark clouds began to gather inside Tamio's heart. Mr. Akanishi? Let me pass those out. There's no time. Okay, thank you. "I hope you find Haw soon." "I'm praying for your reunion." "I hope you find him." "I'll keep my eyes peeled." "Don't worry, you'll find him!" Thank you. "Is this your dog?" They only got the color. Hello? "It's me. Do you have a minute?" What is it? "Is Akanishi nearby?" "Put him on." Akanishi... it's Reiko. Akanishi here. I sent a volunteer to a waste incineration plant. Yes? "I had him ask" "if they'd cremated any animals." "I just got a call." "3 days ago, a dog was hit" "by a truck on Tsunashima Highway." A large white dog... resembling Haw. Can I go see him? "The body has been cremated." How about the microchip? "It was broken." There aren't many missing large white dogs. "I'm pretty confident it was Haw." "I have an update for everyone." "Haw died in a traffic accident." "Rest in peace, Haw." "I'll always remember his photos." "I'm so sorry for your loss." "Hang in there. Hang tough." "I can't imagine even a hundredth of your sadness, Haw Papa." Tamio's new worst day ever... likely became this day. But incredibly, Haw was still alive. "Two weeks earlier" "Tsunashima Shipping Co." You've got to be kidding me? You've been in there since Yokohama? What're you doing? Whose dog is that? I don't know. He came with you? No, he was just wandering around. Go. Scram. Scram! "Haw, Haw!" "Fetch this one! Ready?" The sound of Tamio's voice in his head... was enough to ease Haw's spirit when feeling anxious. "Nice catch, Haw!" To be swaddled in that scent again. That's all Haw could think about. "Shiriyazaki Lighthouse, Aomori Prefecture" Morning. What floor? Seven, please. I heard from Mr. Nabeshima you're not doing so well. It's not good for you to cling to the loss of a pet. I know! Why not buy a new one? The same kind. Is it expensive? "Third floor." Excuse me. What? What was that? A lot of people say to buy a new one. I suppose that's normal. Got a second, Akanishi? I heard from Ms. Suzuki. But I calmed her down so don't worry. I'm so sorry for your trouble. I was... irritated. No, it's my bad. I shouldn't have told her. I'm sorry. - Good night, Chief. - Good night. - Good night. - Thanks. I'm having trouble... believing that Haw is really dead. When I'm working, I often feel his lead in my hands. It's hard to take. I just regret... not holding it firmly then. Akanishi. I realize it's painful... but do you want that feeling to disappear? Sorry, that sounds a little insensitive. But I was thinking that you really wish to feel that. I'll never tire of looking at Mt. Iwate. Right, Pochi? Junpei. Junpei! Give me that. Stop sitting around smoking and lend me a hand! Knock it off, come on! Okay, okay! You made your point! Junpei. You ruined my cigarettes. I got yelled at again, Pochi. Pochi! Hang in there! I hear you hit the girl's bar again. You'll go broke. Here, want this? Look, he ate it! "Are you all ready to embark on "Hannya's big gourmet tour!" "We were born ready! Let's go!" "Woo-hoo!" "Hold on a second!" "This is live television." "I haven't even said the title yet!" - "Do I know you, Lady?" - "Excuse me?" - "You're famous!" - "You caught me." "Aren't you Oniyakko?" "No, she's Kaori Momoi." "Your skin will never betray you." "Who's next to you?" "Sorry, this is my friend, Keiko." "But not a close friend." "That's harsh!" "Our age gap is simply too big." It can't be him, but... It can't be him, but... "Katase Enoshima Station" Try an energy drink! Our unique energy blend will zap you with power! Energy Plant! Zap you with power? So that's what brought you all the way out here? A case of mistaken identity. No, I mean... Thanks for this. This outfit looks terrible on me, don't you think? You can see my belly button. No, no, no. I'm thankful it stops at just the belly button. Right now, I desperately need to earn some extra money. Do you know the pay of a non-regular worker? Yeah, sorta... Sorry. You're kind of bad at a lot of things, aren't you? Bad at life. But I'm not one to talk. "Haw, I'm back!" "Contaminated soil removal" "Suddenly, I was taken from Fukushima" "and moved to an unfamiliar town." "I was told that children under 15 couldn't even visit." "This year, I turned 15." "I was now 'qualified' to enter the evacuation zone." "So stupid." "I was just going home." "It was my first return home since the tsunami." What the...? Ew! You're filthy! What? Stop it. It wasn't suicide. I was just fooling around. Don't follow me. That's enough. Go away. What's with the dog? Mai, will you come today? A thought flashed through Haw's mind. He remembered seeing a girl with a sad face like this before. That's what Haw thought. "Danger: Radioactive" Why does he just sit there? He's still here? This morning, too. He was? I wonder why he's here. I'm going home. No, don't follow me. No! Mai. Come back to school. If anyone hurts your feelings again, I'll take care of them. It's not only me. I'm sure others feel the same. Come back. "Haw, go fetch! Ready?" "Get it!" "one!" "Way to go, Haw! Atta boy!" I found a photo of my dead grandmother. "Nanjo Middle School" Morning, morning. Don't be late. Hurry to class now. Morning. Get moving or you'll be tardy. Are you just going to wait here? Yes, you will. Good morning. Hurry up now. Don't be late. Morning, Miss Asakura. Good morning. Morning. Good morning. Hurry or you'll be marked late. That's 450 yen. Thank you. Thanks for waiting. Can I help you? This certificate of registration... where my wife's name should be. I'm sorry. You don't have to be. It's not your fault. I guess it just has to be done this way. Sorry to disturb you. What was the deal with that old man? His wife's name had been removed and replaced with "Deceased." I think seeing it must have been a heavy shock to him. Even death is just paperwork for government offices. You're right. I'd never really thought about it until now. Can he eat this? He just did. He can have this, too. His fur is all dirty. Is that good? For Haw, this was an extremely curious place. "Benten Shopping Arcade" Everywhere was nothing but closed steel shutters. "We do umbrella repairs" I hear the Saitos... are closing at the end of the year. It seems so. With all it sells, a handicraft shop is very useful. But there are so few customers. It seems so. You know, I've been needing to buy a new umbrella. Thank you. Give my best regards to your husband. I will. "Benten Handicrafts" My my. How dirty you are. Have you lost your voice? My Jiro had throat cancer. He lost his voice, too. Where have you been walking? Care to tell me your name? Haw felt safe and secure with Shizu. It felt like he had always lived here. Jiro did all of the umbrella repair work before. A long time ago. Welcome. I might as well buy a good one seeing as this is an umbrella store. Thank you. Be my guest. You know what Jiro always said? You can always count on the rain. And that's important. Jiro. I know. You can always count on the rain. Right? Be careful. Come on. We're going. You're getting used to this. That one's been with us a long time. Always had a weak kidney, but we recently learned its hereditary. Is that right? Yes, yes. If you're ready, we can discuss the proper timing. Everyone arrives with troubled pasts. But you never see any resentment in their eyes. No, you don't. It was heartbreaking at first. Could you scroll back? The French Bulldog. Remove his photo. You got an okay? Congratulations. Haw was becoming quite exhausted. He could no longer often hear Tamio's voice in his head. "St. Clara Convent, Gunma Takahara" "St. Francis Pray for us" Where did you come from? You're pretty filthy. Sister Cecilia. Yes. What is it? Please don't let that dog inside. He has a badly wounded leg. Is that so? Then be sure to wash him first. Where shall we bathe him? Have you washed a dog before? Never one this big. Where are you going? Wait! Stop! I don't think this dog can bark. He seems very attracted to you. He's so soft and white when clean. Awful injury, poor thing. How long have you been traveling? Even with a divorce... you can get visa to stay if you win custody of Risa. Her father would never allow it. But you wish to remain in Japan... and live with Risa, right? Pardon me, Father. Come kneel. So Miss Megumi, have you grown used to life in the shelter? Yes. Time seems to pass differently when away from his abuse. Walking in the forest reminds me of my hometown in Hokkaido. I feel protected and relieved. Father, I have a confession to make. Please speak freely. Today, a stray dog wandered into the compound. Yes, I heard from Mother Superior. She's very uncomfortable with dogs. That was my dog a long time ago. What do you mean? I did something... very awful to that dog. He's so cute! Come, come! You can pay in installments. Care to hold him? "Special Price! 400,000 yen reduced to 210,000 yen!" He's so warm. He's yours, then. We'll raise him together. - Really? - Sure. Yay! What should we name him? Lucky Why? So he'll bring you a lot of good luck, Megumi. "But then Toshi's work didn't go well." He became... impatient with me because I'm slow. He would suddenly hit me... in the stomach or on the arm. When Lucky barked at him for it, Toshi would explode. "Remove his vocal cords," he demanded. I protested but... he beat me when I did. And so I... did what he ordered. I took Lucky to the veterinarian. That must've been painful for you. But a dog you had in Kanagawa couldn't come all the way here. It's simply too far. Toshi told me to take Lucky to an animal shelter. I did so even though I had no idea what would happen to him. I can see this incident fills you with genuine remorse. You have God's forgiveness. I'm so sorry, Lucky. "I noticed that it's been nearly a year since Haw died." "How are you holding up? Are you good?" "Actually, my cat doesn't have much longer to live." "That's what the vet has told me." "My cat and I have been together for 20 years." "I am so scared." Tamio had vowed never to return to that place. But one day, he found his legs naturally taking him there. There are days lately when I don't think of you, Haw. I'm sorry. "The grace of God be with you always." "And with you." Let us exchange greetings of peace. Peace be with you. Peace be with you. Blessed are those called to the supper of the lamb. Lord Jesus Christ, son of God. Only say the word and my soul shall be healed. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. May the Lord bless and keep you, and give you peace. Haw clearly remembered... how kind she had been. And how sad her face always looked. I thought he'd wear it at the Easter bazaar. It certainly suits him. Yes, it certainly does. We should give him a name. I'm sure you had one. It sounded like he said, "Francesco." I heard that, too. We can't give that name to a dog. Then we shall name him "Francesco." They're done! - Looks delicious. - Thanks. I've brought the next batch. They look great. "Francesco Dog Biscuits" Thank you. Please leave it here. Many thanks. "Lord, grant that I may seek rather to love than be loved." "Easter Bazaar" "Testing, testing, mike check." Hello, how have you been? Good day, everyone. How is the sound over there? Can you hear me okay? Great, thank you. "Sister Helena." Excuse me. I'd like my smartphone. "I need to confirm something." "I tried to delete the photos but found I couldn't." "I felt that the gentle Toshi" "I once knew still existed somewhere." "The man who delivered the flour yesterday..." "was a school friend of Toshi's." "I believe he recognized me." The car will be here in 5 minutes. I'm so glad you found another place. Thank you. Mother Superior! He started yelling when we said we didn't know her. Move aside! Take it easy. I'm Megumi's husband! My wife was kidnapped! What right do you have? We just want a normal life. We truly do not know the person. This is kidnapping! I have a right to see her! I'm going inside. Wait. Let us discuss this. I will listen to your story. Take it easy! Megumi! I'm here! Let's be calm about this! Quiet, everyone! Please understand where you are. I beg you. Mother Superior! Screw you, old lady. Stand back! Take refuge inside! Control yourself! There's a violent man here. Gunma Takahara St. Clara Convent. Please hurry. This place is a sham! Go back. Leave us! Go back, you mustn't go. It's a mistake! Go home! Why would you come here and ruin everyone's happiness? Stay away! Because I love you. I love you. All you have to do is listen to me, Megumi! Stop Francesco! Lucky! This is Lucky! The dog we abandoned. She just called him Francesco. It's Lucky! That dog would've been put down long ago. Well, it's a miracle. Shut up! Francesco! "Let us pray." "Almighty God..." "Strengthen us with your miraculous power of salvation." Grant us the power with your grace to overcome sin. "In the name of Jesus Christ our Lord..." "Amen." Okay, you win! Get up! Francesco! Are you okay? Can you stand? Let's go. Lucky, did you... just save my life? Let me help. Oh, thank you. Miss Adachi, do you know the "Braille Block Song?" Let's see... "Look down at your feet The yellow road guides" "They illuminate your steps Love connecting points to lines" "Like a line of light Connecting eye to eye" "A compass of happiness Opening a door to freedom" Whenever the curtain moves... I feel like my cat Mi is there, and so I start talking to her. Even though she died a month ago. I found Mi when I was four and we'd been together ever since. Even when I moved out on my own. I see. When Mi got sick and started to lose weight... I told the vet... "I don't care how much it costs. You have to cure her!" Of course, I had no money. So I started taking part-time jobs that didn't even suit me... exposing my belly button. Sorry to pour this on you. No, it's totally fine. Tell me, Mr. Akanishi... do you find it painful sometimes to remember Haw? Of course. I thought so. It is painful. How long am I going to feel this way? Grief is... something that doesn't need to go away. That's what I've thought recently. The only thing to do... is to skillfully... set it aside in the cupboard. Miss Adachi, drink some water. What's wrong? I don't know. Living is just... so hard. I take the subway. You drank a lot. Are you okay? Yeah. I can hold my liquor. Okay, then. See ya. What is it? Wow, Mi is really cute. She is a tortoiseshell! That's right. Tamio decided to make a new start and moved in spring... to a one-bedroom riverside condo. More suited to his size, he slept peacefully. It was a holiday. Tamio became Momoko Adachi's neighbor so he promised to have lunch with her. The weather was nice and he felt good. So he decided to stroll the riverbank to the appointed restaurant. "New message from Momoko Adachi" "I arrived early and am inside." Haw? Haw! "Haw, Haw, Haw!" "Where the Hell have you been?" "What happened to you? Haw." Boom! Boom! Boom, stop! I'm so sorry. Come on, Boom! Boom, sit! Good dog! Your dog's named Boom? He wags his tail so hard, it goes "Boom boom." My mom came up with it. I'm so sorry. He just took off running. He's never done that. Boon arrived in place of Dad. Kento. Top boxes in the living room, bottom by the counter. "We moved here after my husband died in an accident." "Boom appeared before us on that day." That also goes in the living room. Living room, too. I see. You need to grip the lead tightly. Okay. Haw, I guess this means goodbye. It'll be all right. Take care, Boom. Sorry. Forgive me. Sorry to pour this on you. I'm glad you were reunited with Haw. Yeah. I wonder what he went through this whole time. "I'm guessing that to find me again..." "he ran with all his might." I think he was looking for me. "He saw many places..." "and met many people." "I wonder who they were." I just pictured him wandering through unfamiliar towns. "I'm sure..." Haw... brought happiness to everyone. "Haw is..." "that kind of pooch." The story of Haw and a lonely boy is coming to an end. But the story of Haw and a boy continues. But that's for another time.
