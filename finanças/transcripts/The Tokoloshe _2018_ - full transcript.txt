He is as old as mankind. Long before he came into our cities he waited in dark forests and deep rivers for the lost, the weak. Cursed by the Great Father, he is as hateful as he is foul. He is the Tokoloshe, one that feeds on children and those left alone. No, I agree with you. This influx of immigrants into Johannesburg has been unprecedented. Neighborhoods like Hillbrow changed virtually overnight. I mean, the issue is they're still coming from all over. There's no more place for them. They're sleeping rough, sardines packed into condemned buildings with no water, no electricity. It's a health hazard. Busi Zondi, welcome to the night shift. Thank you for the opportunity. Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't thank me. If it had been my choice you wouldn't be here. Can I ask why, sir? You're all just trouble. The last girl that was in here left after two months. It's a constantly revolving door. It makes my job difficult. No, not me, sir. I'm more than committed to the work. Are you, now? Your shift starts at 9 p.m. You arrive late, they'll deduct pay. If you leave early they'll deduct pay. Make sure that you clock in. And wear your regulation uniform otherwise... I must pay. Mm. Take it. Hello? It's very quiet for a hospital. Budget cuts, care is rent-free. What's that? Budget cuts. This is where it all comes. Do I have to use that? No, whatever you do, don't ever go near that. Sometimes cats stay in there. Make sure it's not you. Get those bags and give it to this beauty. Is she the new one? Mm-hmm. You need to get a receipt for all those. Wouldn't want this stuff ending up in a landfill where kids can find it. Now, do we? What is it? Human waste. Can you tell me about Mr. Ruatonim? Honey, if I can give you some advice, keep your tits tucked in and legs crossed and everything will be fine. Get in, it's wet. My stop's around the corner, sir. I wanted to apologize for earlier. It's been difficult with the layoffs and people not coming to work. Um... Can I ask why the other girl left, sir? Ah, she, um, she said she couldn't handle the graveyard shift anymore. It's challenging work. I'm not afraid of hard work, sir. That's good to know. Let me drive you home. We can have a proper introduction. Um, honestly, sir, my stop's around the corner. Okay. Suit yourself. Bitch. Look what I brought for you. It's a sheet. Don't shout at me because I did not buy it. Do you like it? Soon I will have money to bring you here! I promise you my sister we will be together again. Lindi? Hello? Can you hear me? Lindi? Shit. My God. My God. Hello? Hello? Is there somebody there? Hey. You're not supposed to be down here. What do you want here? You're not supposed to be here! What's going on? New here? I was following the boy down the stairs. Oh, Thabang. He's always sneaking off, but we're far too few to keep an eye on them all. They are sick? Some are, but most are AIDS orphans booked in for monitoring and just forgotten. There we go. Okay, come, let's get into bed. You are really good with them. You learn. Have any of your own? Every night it's something else. I'm Rosie, by the way. Busi. The new cleaner, right! Have you heard the old stories? About the Tokoloshe that tricks children into trusting him before drowning them? That's why the bricks are here, but, um, let's just say he isn't small. They don't know what I mean. I really must get back to work. Ruatonim. Geez, babe, if there ever was a Tokoloshe, it's Ruatonim. I must get back to work. It was nice to meet you. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! What were you doing? There are rules and I'm here to make sure people follow them. I must get back... No. Yes, sir. Why the sudden rush? Do you have a boyfriend, Busi Zondi? No! Please, sir, let me go! How much do you need this job? Let me hear it again! Let me go! Shut up! Shut up! Run! Run! Busi Zondi? Hiding isn't going to help. Thank you. Please give me a moment, sir. If you don't have the correct fare, you don't ride. I'm sorry. Come on, come on, you're holding up the rest of my passengers, please. Take this money and pay the driver. I can't accept it. Take this money If you don't want me to hit you with this stick. Thank you. Thank you. It's going to be okay. What are you doing? I'm sorry my child... ...If it seems like I'm prying... ...but my spirit senses that... ...your soul is troubled. There is a way... I have to get off here. Are you coming with me? Why? My daughter once said to me... ...If you want to be strong... ...you have to wake up, ...and do something. Are you coming? I'm sorry... ...I don't even know you! Abel. My name is Abel. Have a nice day then. The police where here again... ...threatening to evict people... ...all they wanted was a bribe... ...you know how they are. I'll get my boys and we'll deal with them. Jesus. My boys don't have hearts you know. This whole thing is just a mess. There you go, madame. Ta-da! So Busi tell me... ...this place is too big... ...It's way too big for you to be alone. Sleeps at least 20. We come a long way, you and I... Not once did I ask you for money. ...I always knew you'd pay. But now, I need to ask peeps. Where is the money? The money is needed. But, I don't get that money, they break my legs, Busi, they come for you. Come on Busi make a plan... ...you know that you and me... ...since way back I knew you wanted me! I'll pay you, Jakes. But then Busi, when? Okay girl, next week. I never get my way with this one. Tonight we'll be talking about the shocking levels of child abuse in South Africa. One in three children is sexually abused. Feels good my child? Virtually murdered his own daughter, I don't want this! It feels nice! believing she was a Tokoloshe. I don't want this! But you love it! I know you have to leave that place. I have a plan... ...I promise you my sister. Sir? Sir? It's me, the girl from the bus. Ah, my stubborn little daughter. My name is Busi. I'm sorry for yesterday. I should not have been rude. Don't worry about it. Wait! The offer still stands. Tea, talk, or both. Both. Sometimes... ...a week can go by with no one coming in... ...because... ...I forget to switch the lights on. There we go. Let me put the kettle on. You make these masks? Every one of them. How? My child... ...spiritual healers don't need eyes... ...to see the spiritual world. Even the hands... ...they get used to the work. They are... Ugly? Scary? They are supposed to be scary... ...because the evil spirits... ...will be scared away by them. They are beautiful. Tea? Tell me my child... ...what has brought you to this Godforsaken place? I came here because of work. You shouldn't be smoking. That's like my little Dina used to say. Don't smoke. You see my daughter... ...these masks... ...you see on the wall of my place... ...they have great powers within them. What? Secrets. What's troubling you so much my child? I left my sister alone... ...and I don't know how I'm going to get her here. Where is your sister right now? I must go. Forgive me. I did not mean to offend you. No... ...you didn't. Take one. No sir. I can't. Take one, my child! It's my way of apologizing. Lumukhanda, the cannibal chief. This is a very powerful weapon with great strength. There are many folktales about Lumukhanda... ...battling against evil forces. He's wise as he is mischievous. I will make a trade with you. You take the mask and take this lighter. No, Sir. Lighter must be worth... Take the mask... ...and help me to stop smoking. I'm old... ...don't argue with me. At the tone, record your message. To end press hash. I've been leaving you voicemails... ...I'm worried. Anyway, I got you a present. I hope you love it. Call me! What will I do? What will I do? You're back. I need the job. You do. You need a cleaner. Why should I take you back? Do I have the job or not? That depends. Come here. I said, come here. I'm keeping half of this week's wages to replace the uniform you tore. They're expensive. And where have you been? Hmm? Sick. Oh. So. That didn't take you long at all. Wipe that look off your pretty little face. Did I not tell you to stay away from him? I don't want to! I don't want to! But we are going to have fun. We'll be together. No, I don't want that. I told you, I don't want to! Hey. You should not be down here. Don't come closer! Why? He forbids it. Who? The tokoloshe!
