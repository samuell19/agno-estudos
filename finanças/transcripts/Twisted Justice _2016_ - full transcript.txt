Don't tell me... Isn't it your doing? Don't make people so bad. Ordinary people will not aim at junior school girls. It isn't because he was so smug. It's because he is a fool.

I told the office of the Kawato group last night, but you need to hand over the person who shot. Can't you just spare us? Because you can say something,... We have the guts to choose to assist you. We also prepared a gun. What did you say you prepared a gun? Even if I caught this idiot,... This can't be done. Aren't you afraid of disputes? If it causes a dispute,.. Hokkaido police are going to be serious. Is it OK to come here and search for you? Don't talk nonsense. I said it was my shot. I will kill you. This little idiot is pulling my hair. Moroboshi Please Believe me. I can kill you here. Moroboshi, please. We have tried our best. Really. Bring the bag Hold this Listen, I will only say it once, remember it. Give your hands. After being chased by the police from Minami Street 4 to Nishizumi Street,... You surrendered a gun and are arrested on the spot. Do you remember what I told? OK stand up Stand up. You come too Put the gun away Yes Wait What's up? I heard Moroboshi would come in person. We just ordered takeaway. Sorry, I made you wait. Who are you? Say hello to others. I know.. My name is Taro. What's wrong with this guy? He was just released from a drug offense. Still on probation. He has a relationship in the Yakuza. Can you help me take care of him? Please. This is not a job agency. Drug addicts like this will definitely not work. No no no, I don't take drugs. I was just arrested when I was forced to deliver drugs. Really. What have you been eating since just now? This is a sleeping pill. Hey It doesn't matter how it looks. Two cups of coffee He can speak Russian. Both guns and drugs come from Russia. He is useful. Russian This is what the sister really looks like. Is it here? Let's go Where is it? Don't talk nonsense. Know how to be an informer. It's faster to see it for yourself. Yes Granny, I heard that you recently changed the seller. Now, people in Tokyo are selling drugs. For me, as long as I am getting.. I don't care who it is. Do you know which group of people? If you really want to know,... Just bring me something else. Moroboshi, is this Granny also an informant? It's best to know who sells drugs. But she really takes drugs. Maybe she is getting relief. Granny, we will come again. Live long. Moroboshi hasn't come lately. Did he go to another store? Why can't you drink? I'm not in good health. Then you quit the medicine. But I am really touched. What? The work of the police is really not easy. Moroboshi, you are amazing. Maintaining law and order is not a simple matter. If you give me valuable information,.. I will take good care of you. OK Taro, what are you doing? I am a DJ what? Playing disco in the ballroom. So cool. Why do you a DJ to help people transport drugs? How do I say, I just want to be famous. No matter what I can make big money. I haven't heard of anyone who is famous for delivering drugs. I feel like I can do great things with you. I am in the Otaru family. Of a second-hand car shop called Dachi. It has many Russian guests. I will continue to provide you with useful information. You guys are quite interesting. Thank you. How dangerous are these kids? Boss Oh Taro Rashid, here. Let me introduce you. Rashid Hello, I am Rashid Is this a stolen car? Yes, it is a stolen car. Don't say that. Do you want to sell it to Russia? Yes Rashid's network is very profitable. Why did you call me to Otaru? He got a gun. Gun? Pistol. You This is real. Yes, real. The Russian who came to buy a car yesterday, ... Left the gun when I said, "not enough cash". I told him, and he would help us. Moroboshi, I also want to be an informant. Please This will not work. Why? It's OK, it's your merit. Things are not that simple. Did you say you got a gun after selling a stolen car? Can it be the trouble? The gun whose owner is unknown is called headless. If you can't catch the criminal together, It doesn't work at all. You can't wear shoes. Sorry Should I treat my cousin as a criminal? Can we really trust that guy? It's OK. He is a good person. He will never betray us. He doesn't have a back door. What do you mean "doesn't have no back door"? Rashid was in prison until the year before. If he is caught again, he will be sent back to Pakistan. He will just be deported back to China. He will be killed. This is delicious. Two years passed quickly. When you come out, go back to Pakistan. Use that money to build a house. Then, we will go. Please. Let's go How did you forget this? Boss, you forgot to take the gun. Sorry sorry I forgot about this. Don't point at me, it's dangerous. Don't you have a camera? Yes Help us take a picture. OK Stand here stand here. Then, ready. OK Smile, smile. Yes, cheese. Don't worry Amazing. So hot. Russians gave it to you. Yes, Russian. Anyway, this is sneak fishing. Yes, sneak fishing. But having said that. The words of our group may beat the world. Go get the beer or something. They can't drink, so don't. Why can you not drink? I am Pakistani. Stop, don't do that. I am Pakistani. OK Pakistan It's Pakistan. Pakistan Hey, what's going on? Hey, bro. Actually, I plan to leave the organization. Local Yakuza... Have been annexed by local organizations. My boss said about what to do... But I didn't want to succumb to the people from the mainland. But leaving the organization requires money. How much? Bro, I beg you. I have no one to rely on except you. I get it You also help me a lot. Don't worry, just leave the money to me. I'll remember your kindness. It's OK Even if I leave the organization I will still be your informant. I will work hard to return the money to you. Sorry Hey brother, raise your head. Really, don't be like this. What the hell are you doing? What's going on? This is my gun. How many do you have? Not deliberately hiding, Come on. I am killing you. It hurts Give me a try. There are bullets in the gun. It's dangerous. Wait It is dangerous. It has bullets. If you fail,.. Impossible Look at it and shoot. The mayor of Nagasaki was hit by someone. Murders with gunshot wounds across the country. There have been 8 shootings this month. The National Police Department has established a gun offense section. Increasing number of shootings involving ordinary citizens. Hokkaido urgently needs to establish a gun offense section. Yes There is information that there are still a lot of guns. No hesitation, no need to worry. Quickly find the gunman. Yes Hokkaido Police Headquarters Gun Offense Section appointed Moroboshi as the second team leader. Are you Moroboshi? Who are you? There is no one who does not know you. You are the ace. What ace? Gun Offense Section has just been established. I know. Moroboshi Will be ace. Ace, your mouth is open. Don't make me happy. People who are productive are good. No no no Say... How many guns did you seize before? About 10 Amazing Can I talk for a while? Chief has been saying... Now that a section has been set up for guns... You can't let other sections take the lead. Can you seize one this week? This week? For you, there must be a way... Yeah, but.. Is headless OK? I'm looking forward to it. Even if one or two are seized, Taro, you need to work harder. I'm burning. Really wasteful. By the way, do the police have funds? I am, temporarily. So, whether it is headless or cottage,... Anything, help me get something.. Brother, can you prepare the gun? How many do you need? As much as you can prepare. I'm sorry to disturb you. Is it the police station? I am a member of a gang. I want to leave the organization. So I put the gun in the lockers at Odori Station, Toho line. Please check. OK, bye. On Sunday,... I'm going to eat in a special place. You are so good, brother. Exceeding the limit, withdrawal failed. Are there three Tokareva? Yes What to do next? Next month seems to be a gun control month, right? Yes Let's hand them in together. Hey, check which day is auspicious. OK Guys Yes Can you learn some from Moroboshi? Where children live, some people wander outside with guns. If it is neglected, it will end in a catastrophe. Yes Hope you found the guns. 20,000 a day, I will give you 60,000. Remember the receipt. OK As I said. Ace You are pretty Ace Emergency news Kurimatsu Takashi police chief was shot. According to news, this morning around 8:30 When Chief Kurimatsu walked out of the house,.. He was shot with a suspected gun. What happened? It seems that the chief was shot. What are you saying? You became so big. Look at the gun. Miss you again. The police department is in chaos now. Pressed above and said that in this case, even the water gun could get a merit point. The criminal is telling that the next target is also the top-level police. Really? Really a trouble. You can only come up with some results. The deputy chief also said that the budget could be increased. Not everything, though. It depends on how many you can bring. Moroboshi Yes Can you bring in ten at once? Ten pieces? It should be difficult. Yes In this case, please search the gang from the mainland. Let them bring a few. Is it possible outside the city? Yes A Tokyo gangster had hosted in Susukino before. If you look for him, you should be able to buy it at a conscience price. Isn't this good? Yeah Sorry, do you want to buy a gun? Yes Deputy chief It's just that a regular search can't seize a gun. Or buy directly from Russia. Russia? Let my informer go buy. Over there, it should be 20,000 to 30,000. This is fine. Yes. No, no, wait. Does it cost us to go to Russia? Just don't declare as the travel expenses. Why did you go to Russia on a business trip? Even the chief was shot. Is it time to follow the rules? Even one gun is collected. It can reassure Hokkaido citizens. Yeah Anyway, in the end, it will still be in our hands. It was also a way to buy before then. Why don't you go to the store today? Anyway, it's OK not to go after getting the money. What do you eat? I'm hungry Give me some food. Hello, what does it mean? I'm sorry. Like an idiot. Why is this always the case? Ah? When I came back, I realized that I was just a cash machine. Anyway, do you have other women? What are you dreaming, idiot? Who is an idiot? Who is the idiot? So happy with Yakuza Did you forget what happened to your senior? You will lose the value and be abandoned. Shut up Annoying I tell you our deal is... Not as simple as yours. If you break your teeth, swallow it. Exhaust all available. To reach a deal. If you don't do this, the world will not be good. Don't be so dreadful. I still want to teach you, idiot. What is there? Already onboard the ship so can get here next week. Souvenirs It is not souvenirs! I asked if I went to Russia and bought one. Quotes are more expensive than imagined. This one is also easy to buy. And they know that I am Japanese. That's why I took Rashid. This guy got a woman. It's not me, it's Taro it's not me. It's you You guys have it all. Sorry Where did you go? I went to find my informant. Did you get the gun from Tokyo? Eh? I got it. Then, bring it quickly. I'm Kuniyoshi from the Metropolitan Police Department. Hello We received call from the courier company. From the delivered goods,.. We found three guns. The delivery address is Hokkaido Police Headquarters. For Moroboshi. The ordinary person will deliver it by courier. Think it's faster. No wonder you have such a high collection rate. Speechless Aren't you ashamed to do such a thing? This is not the first time we have done. Wait a minute You are also in the gun offense section, right? It's the same if the chief is shot. What is shameful to seize guns? Don't interrupt us in Hokkaido if you come from Tokyo. Never mind that my colleague was caught. I won't pursue this matter. But in exchange I will take the three guns. Hey, wait. Stop stop How can you just give them credit? Sorry I only got one in Russia. How to explain it to finance. You guys Don't be held up just because you are called ace. I have also done my best. I will have gone to Tokyo if I get a business trip. There are as many excuses as you want afterwards. I am not giving excuses. I borrowed money to get a gun. I did everything I could. If this is not enough, you should give more budget. I secretly collected so many merits points. Let me write a receipt. Only a 10,000 or 20,000 will be given to a gun. This is not a part-time job in a beef restaurant, right? We are also difficult. How can all the funds be spent? It's almost like being passionate. How did it go, brother? Not good. The other party knew that the police needed a gun recently. Damn, the price will be raised. I had to force them to take the gun out. May be a bit precautionary to us. How can you still make no money when you work so hard what did you say? Don't say it, Rashid. You also said that it's better to sell the gun to make money. What do you mean? What do you mean, do you have an opinion on my approach? We do not mean that. Then, what does that mean? I don't earn money? Hello, you mean i didn't work hard? Calm down Fuck it. I'm working hard to support you. Sorry Don't say sorry now, you fuckers. It's so cool to spend my money. Hey, it's me who complains now. I'm supporting you with debts. You guys still complain to me. If it wasn't for me, you would all be unemployed. You have been exiled back to China. Sorry Oh shit Sorry, not your fault. You fucking shut up. Sorry But brother, you should understand them too. If you really want to hand over the gun we still have bullets. The police will give a good fee. Those can't be used. I can do that kind of thing long ago. Then sell drugs. What? If you do this, you can get money and use that money to get a gun. What are you talking about? All for the gun. We will sell drugs, even if we don't sell them,... It will circulate in the market anyways. It's fine if we participate a little bit. But that is a crime. Let's do it. As long as we have money, we can still fight. You can also go to Russia again. Brother, it is worth a try. Just do it Of course not If you do this business, you will definitely get drugs. I don't want you to touch that kind of thing. Thanks, thanks. This is my first time getting this feeling. Great, granny. I'm awesome, love me. Fuck off Kuroiwa Can i get some drugs? Here. May I? In exchange, if there is a gun, immediately notify me. Chinese guns don't work. No, this is not good. How about this? Hey, be careful. Dangerous - Sorry, sorry You have a bullet it's okay Drugs make money Yes I want to use this money to buy a lot of large refrigerators. On April 25, 2011,... Moroboshi arrested private gunmen and got merits and special bonuses. Amazing It's amazing A good woman wants to live in a good place and eat. Wants good things. Hey Hey Marriage? Taro, isn't it great? Thanks to you Then I discussed with Rashid The economy is relatively stable, and I plan to open a curry restaurant together I have already found a place Not bad, Rashid’s personal curry? Do it! You always need money. No no no want I don't want it No need. I don't really want. You are so nice We are a family. Look, our boss is good. Such a rare opportunity Let the boss decide the name of the store. Don't do that. Welcome guests from Pakistan. Congratulations on your marriage. I wish you to last a century. Boss, please make a speech. No way No matter what, I hope you can finish it. No please No, no. Please, please. What are you talking about? Please. You are like his half-father. Ace of the Gun Offense Section please Moroboshi Annoying When I first saw this guy He was introduced to me by a brother. That guy was taking sleeping pills. Such a little rogue,.. Married such a beautiful wife. Opened such a good shop. If I say now, I have the important task of maintaining the safety of Hokkaido. Some of that. Part of that is Taro's credit. Look at this kid is cute too. For me, Taro is... Just like my little brother. Taro, I will also.. Work harder to be good police. Taro, from now on too, you.... Will continue to help me. And I wish you a happy wedding. May you stay together forever. Thanks. And later... I still have to ask you to get a gun. Congratulations What's your expression? You two are really troublesome. I should have made it, but they have caught it early. I'm really looking forward to it as being able to participate in the sneak search is rare. The problem is, how did the police station know? Don't be so nervous. Anyone who reads it will think you are Yakuza. Yes. I heard that we are cooperating with Hokkaido police. I didn't expect it to be you. It's really honourable to work with you again. What do you mean? Everyone in the Metropolitan Police is responsible for monitoring for the time being. In the final analysis, let's direct this operation. But I have been following this smuggling route for a long time. All say that sneaking into the investigation is the strength of the police. What the hell are you talking about? OK OK Here, three million. So much budget. But you should be worthy of Chief Kunimatsu. Eight guns were prepared as you said. It's true. If you want the same, You can prepare twenty to thirty a year. Got it. Anyway, I'll take these first. But your import line is quite good. Philippines? Let's talk about it after the formal transaction. That's true. It looks like we can be a long-term trading partner. -Yeah Let's go You Have you practiced judo? No! Of course, you practised, look at your ears. What are you talking about? Have you ever practised judo? - I haven't, I already told you. This guy definitely has a problem. Where is the problem? How can a gangster have such ears? Really. What are you doing? Stop, you bastard What a joke. What the fuck. Are you kidding me? What are you doing bastard?

Don't you want to be human? Idiot Sorry What did you do, you idiot? Sorry forgive me forgive me Sorry Sorry Why do you touch that stuff? Because I want to respond to you. Idiot Sorry You idiot Sorry You idiot Is it really okay? You can't quit if you take drugs. Take her away. Come on Here Come over here It's okay come slower Oh shit Hello Brother, can you come out now? I have something to discuss with you. It is not a good time now. Anyway, hurry up I'm waiting for you in the old place 200 pieces? Too loud Will you grab 200 next time? Let them smuggle in from Hong Kong. Then steal it quietly. It's a big sum. Do it or not? Of course I also want to make such a big bet. This is Sakuraba, who just transferred. I am Sakuraba, please take care of me. I am Shimada. I am Oiwa. Let's start, Moroboshi. Yes. First of all 20 kg of drugs were smuggled from Hong Kong. 20 kg of drugs This batch of smuggled drugs First of all we hope to get assistance .. From customs and bring them in. Bring in? Yes This way, we can gain the trust of Hong Kong drug dealers. By letting go of this first drug smuggling. Next time,.. We will make them Smuggle 200 guns. Then, they will let their designated Chinese merchants smuggle. Finally, we arrest these Chinese and these guns... All at once. Longline for big fish Yes In this case What to do with smuggled drugs in the beginning? We can only let go. But if successful, 200 guns can be seized at once. Whether for Hokkaido police or customs, It's a new national record. We are going to be number one in Japan. Yes I have a question Please speak. Where will the drug that will be released go to? Actually, it was Kanto's Yakuza that originally made this plan. So, it will flow to the Yakuza. Is it going to the market in Kanto? Forget it. Right? Please wait. 20 kg of drugs. If one gram is 30,000 yen. It's.... 600 million. 600 million. It's too chaotic to say anything. You can deliver 200 guns in one breath. Deputy Chief! Which is more important, guns or drugs? Even if you ask me Customs side Does that part of the market go okay? In that case, if Hokkaido police is fine, Newcomers.... How many kg of drugs did we seize last year? Eh... Is it about 30 kg? 30 kg? In other words, 20 kg is still less than last year. Yes Then, such a thing makes sense, too. What to do? I... This one Then, why don't we do it? OK Why is it called a monkey? Monkey Trading Company Because of the person in charge of this company.. Is the chief Saruwatari. It doesn't matter what the name is. Anyway, it's not a real company. You guys answer the phone here starting today. Work hard. Okay? What are you doing? Shut up and come over to me. I heard you left the organization. Seems to make a lot of money with the drugs. What are you saying? Don't pretend to be dumb. Who made you sell drugs? What do you want to do? Or you can stab me with this. Is this really okay? It's said that the police are assisting in smuggling. What do you say? Sorry I understand but... It's my first time participating in such a large-scale fishing law enforcement. What are you doing as police? Yes? I asked you why you want to be the police. Just that's because to maintain the safety of the society. Protect people from crime. Did I say anything strange? Forget it This one is okay. Okay Let's go Drive, you.. Yes What will come out? Are you idiot? Boss Ah? How does this look more than 20 kg? The Chinese have a bad brain. Is it wrong? Chinese people are so funny. So funny brother One box is not enough I brought the spare. You are great. Well prepared. Brother, sorry what Help me follow Your superior says Don't say stupid words. There are 200 guns already. Where is the police? I still want to thank you. I will contact you again after delivery. Brother what You have to drive carefully. I can't help if you get caught at speeding. Why? 1g will not be found. I don't want drugs. As a memory. Memory? As a memory. Beware on the road. Hello Chief Drug Finally shipped out Hey What? How many kg are there actually? What? Customs said it's more than 20 kg. About 130 kg. 130? In other words, the total value.. 4 billion 4 billion Just forget the extra. Kanto Yakuza is beaten. Stop talking, idiot. You guys So much drugs. It's completely different from what you said. Yeah Moroboshi I used to say that 20kg is less than last year. Please wait It's that but... The real target... The real target is the gun behind, isn't it? It doesn't matter how much drugs are there. This is a big deal. This must bear the cross. What does the cross mean? You probably don't understand. I don't understand. But illegal searches and illegal acts. I've done it several times. But every time I report to the chief, right? The financial side is also clear. Don't say anything. How does that work? What are you guys? You all bully me together. What does it mean? Is it that you didn't do anything bad? Hey Is it only me who colluded with the Yakuza to conduct an illegal search? Chief, answer me. How did I do until now? Don't you all know? Moroboshi Don't touch me you, jerk. Why? Just at this time.. The cross? Hey what? Really? Understood understood Yes. What happened? Sorry, please call the police immediately. Kuroiwa ran away with drugs. Sit down. How does Mr Police prepare to compensate me? How can drugs disappear like this? I paid to Hong Kong. Or Mr Police, will you pay the debt? Say something We can't hear you, jerk! Don't move, bastard. But It's Kuroiwa. You can't blame the police. I'm only responsible for drug delivery. It's also risky. It seems you don't understand. What's with this dumpling ear? Don't move, bastard. How does it hurt? You I made a lot of money by imitating Yakuza. Do you think you can step back with the wrong step? Who will keep me quiet? Stop it. Stop it. I know The drugs. I will hand over the drugs. You said Bring the drugs. How about it? One ton we collected before. I will bring all to you. As expected from the ace of Hokkaido Police. Well, you can still talk.. Same as before. Will you continue to smuggle 200 guns? Don't make bargains with me! Gun smuggling is terminated. Please don't. That one. In this case.. Hokkaido police and customs can't explain. I don't care about you. Give me a gun. Gun smuggling is terminated. Do you understand? Did you violate the agreement? I know. But we are also in big trouble. No way. We assisted you to expose the smuggling of guns. Make them smuggle the guns over. That can't be done. The guns are gone. Then, take it from your police warehouse. Whether you are caught or not has nothing to do with us. What do you mean it doesn't matter? It doesn't matter. Moroboshi You should also consider their position. Please I beg you Really, just this time. Please What are you doing? Hurry up. Here too. Get it done by tomorrow. And put it inside. Hey Put in. Boss. Put it here. Boss Help me. No way. It's okay.

OK, don't worry I will solve it well Do you want to refresh after a long time today? Not bad Let's go, Rashid. This shop will not work. What? Russian customers... No one came.

Yes Behind your crime... Is there pressure from the police? Pressure Yes You are the victim of a crime organized by the police. The police blame all on you and intend to conceal the fact that the entire police committed a crime. Why is it the police crime? What? I got drugged. This is unjustifiable. But the police's search policy... To gain a deeper understanding of crime is needed. This is really amazing. Then Moroboshi You still think.. The police followed the correct search policy? Of course I who judo and fight is selected. And got other contemporaries and unmatched opportunities. To repay this kindness,.. I worked hard. This effort.. Police officers.. Must see it in their heart. I want to seriously atone and .. Return to the workplace as soon as possible. And also I have a man named Taro Yamabe... In the detention center. He is my partner. Partner... Actually like my family. After his Defense over there.. And release,... Can I trouble you to help him? Taro Yamabe. Please and also Sir If you meet the chief police officers// Please tell them Ace Moroboshi is.. With full of energy. Kenjiro Yes Oda Yes Watanabe Yes Ryuji Maeda Yes But after receiving the news of the death of Taro, Kishitani admitted to the organized crime of the police. Youichi Moroboshi supports Hokkaido police in the initial statement. Moroboshi is being interrogated. Disclosed the name of the chief. But there is nothing related to the police organization in the verdict. None of the police officers except Moroboshi were arrested.
