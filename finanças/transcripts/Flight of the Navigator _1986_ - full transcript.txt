(WHIRRING) (UPBEAT MUSIC) (CROWD CHEERING) ANNOUNCER: As you can see, Lynn never breaks her dog's rhythm. She uses rapid-fire multiple discs, throwing them high to display Muffy's wonderful coordination and agility. A terrific exhibition by last year's runners up. Next up Judith Lynman and Rocky. Watch how Rocky doesn't take off until... Watch this one. Wow! Let's try it. Come on, Bruzer, give it to me. Drop it. Let it go, Bruzer. Let it go. Let it go. Strong toss...and he catches it. Go on, Bruzer, get it! Get it! Easy, even toss and he grabs it! Go on, get it, Bruzer. Get it! Look! Look! Jump, Bruzer! Oh, man! Winner of the 1978 South Florida Frisbee Dog Championship is Judith Lynman and Rocky! I'm gonna teach you real hard. All right, boys, let's go. What d'you say? That dumb dog will never learn to catch a frisbee. He will so, and don't call him dumb. How about retarded? Some day he's going to win that championship. - Don't make me laugh. - Hey! What! Hey... (WHOOSHING) (EERIE MUSIC) All right, guys. I guess... You know, Bill, I don't really feel like cooking tonight. You don't have to cook. We'll get in the boat and get some hamburgers. Guess what! David's got the hots for Jennifer Bradley. Shut up! - Dad! He's knuckling me! - Dehydrated pizza face! David, just stop provoking your little brother, please. But Dad... No, really. That's the last I want to hear from both of you. Now give us a break. I can't believe this. JEFF: Dad, can I play at Billy's? DAD: Yeah, I guess so. Just look out for the fireworks. MUM: Make sure you be back before dark. Give me that. - Weasel! - Dork! - Buttface! - Scuzbucket! You'll never see your ninth birthday, I promise. (CAR STEREO: "You're the One That I Want" from Grease) MUM: I wish you two would try to get along. He's a jerk. Oh, come on. It's just a phase. He'll grow out of it. If he lives that long. Is that any way to talk about your little brother? No, I guess not. Just try and remember you're the oldest, all right? All right, all right. - Hi, David. - (BICYCLE BELL RINGS) Hi, Jennifer. - Oh, there she is. Hey there! - Hi, Jennifer! Hey! Think fast! Oh! Honey, stay out of the refrigerator. We're going out to dinner soon. Don't worry. I'll be hungry. Come on, boy! You know how to open these? - Yes, I do, dear. - Thank you. RADIO: On 4th July 1978, an American top 40 extra. - David? - Dad! Aren't you gonna watch the game? I was just... watching the boats. Oh, yeah? Oh! So you do have a crush on Jennifer Bradley. No, not really. I barely even know her. You ever tried talking to her? How are you supposed to talk to girls? It's impossible. Well, you just have to try to strike up a conversation. "Hi! How you doin'? That's a nice bike!" If you're going to learn to swim you just gotta jump in the water. I guess. David? Don't forget to feed Bruzer. I won't. Come on, Bruzer. Good boy. That'll make you big and strong so you can win that championship. David? David? Oh, would you go and meet Jeff? The Johnsons said he left about five minutes ago. He's eight years old, Mum. I know but I don't like him going through the woods alone. I think he can make it a half mile on his own. Now, you hurry up. And we're gonna get some burgers and we're going to set off those fireworks of yours. OK? OK. Come on, Bruzer! (TRAIN RATTLING) (WIND WHISTLES) (BRUZER WHINES) What is it, macho man? Not afraid of a little wind, are ya? (BRUZER WHINES) See, Bruzer? What you gotta do is be a "take charge" guy. That's what girls like. (EERIE MUSIC) Come on, boy. Come on! Wanna know my real problem? I don't know what I want out of life any more. As a young dog, you might find that hard to understand but... (TWIG SNAPS) Jeff? Jeff? (RUSTLING) (BRUZER BARKS) Get back, Jack. I've got a gun. - (TWIG CRACKS) - Phew! - Agh! - (DAVID SCREAMS) - Ugh! - Gotcha! Gotcha! - I'll kill you! - (BRUZER BARKS) (TRAIN HOOTS) - Bruzer? - (BRUZER BARKS) What is it, Bruzer? (BRUZER BARKS) Come on, boy. We'd better get home. Agh! Uh! - (BRUZER BARKS) - (TRAIN HOOTING) - (CRICKETS CHIRPING) - (HE GROANS) Bruzer! Here, Bruzer! Bruzer! Here, Bruzer! Open up, you little punk! You hear me? I said open up! Who are you? Who are you? I...I'm David. I live here. Think you have the wrong house, dear. Where's my mum? I have no idea. Are you lost? Hey! Where do you think you're going? Now, just a minute. You've made a mistake. Mum? Dad? Oh! Oh! Mum! Larry! (MUSIC PLAYING) What's the problem, son? Now, calm down, son. Nobody is going to hurt you. What's your name? Where do you live? Please... Where's my mum and dad? Janet, call the police. It's chaos here. You're gonna have to process this. Yeah, what city? What address, do you know? Which park? - Oakwood Park, OK. - Are you in the city? - We're having some problems... - Yes, ma'am. (CONVERSATIONS MINGLE) TV: Reporters are investigating what has caused power blackouts in sections of two counties. Emergency generators are in operation in Lauderdale General Hospital. Not hungry, huh? Is my dad coming yet? Phil... We ran his name and the computer came up with this. Oh good, a missing person report. David Scott Freeman, hair brown, eyes brown. Last seen wearing blue clothes, shirt red and white stripes, blue jeans and white sneakers. Carrying a blue knapsack. - Have we located the parents? - Yes, but Phil, look at the date. What about it? Must be a typo. I ran it through the computer three times. That's no mistake. He was declared legally dead. Who's dead? No-one's dead, David. Come on. Let's start putting this puzzle together. Now, David, just a few more questions for our paperwork, OK? How old are you? - I already told you. Twelve. - Right. And what is the date today? It's the fourth of July. What year? Nineteen seventy-eight. David, who's the President of the United States? Duh! You wanna know that for your paperwork? Mm-hm. Well? It's Jimmy Carter. Why are we stopping? You'll see. - (SHIP'S HORN BLARES) - Be right back. Who lives here? We're not sure yet. (KNOCKS) (DOG BARKS) Quiet! Quiet down! Look, I'm sorry to disturb you folks. But are you the same William Freeman who reported missing a son? David Scott Freeman on July 4, 1978? Yes. Dad! David? David, wait a second. Well, I'm Detective Banks, juvenile division. It seems that we... (WHISPERS) David? But... Oh my God! Thank God! (MEN CALLING OUT) (HELICOPTER WHIRS) (BANGING) Dr Faraday. Any signs of life? Not outside, but we haven't been able to determine what's inside. Well, something must have flown it. This could be our first contact. She's beautiful! Sir, this is the night watchman who found it - Ellis Brayton. Says he hasn't told anyone except the local authorities so what we have here is a controlled situation. Mind your step. Mr Brayton... - Hi. - Hi. Lewis Faraday, NASA. Sure is a pretty piece of spacelab. It was flying along and it just smacked right into the tower and dragged it about 100 yards. Then it stopped and it's floating here. Say, I don't suppose you gentlemen could tell me how you do that? No, Mr Brayton, it's a matter of national security. - Any idea how we're gonna move it? - You kidding? Watch this. - No. - (DOG BARKS) (ECHOING VOICES) Who are you? What's happening? Just rest, David. I don't wanna rest. Where's my mum and dad? We're right here, sweetheart. What's happening, Mum? I'm scared. Don't be scared, honey. I won't let anybody hurt you. What happened to you, Mum? - You too, Dad? - One, two, three... Why were those people in our house? Why? David, we don't know all the answers to all this yet but the main thing is... You're alive! David, where have you been all this time? All this time? I just went to get Jeff at the Johnsons a few hours ago. Get Jeff. He'll tell you. David? Who's that? That's your brother. Jeffrey. What? Mr and Mrs Freeman? Could I see you outside for a few minutes please? Sure. Honey? We'll be right back. You look just like I remember you. This is totally rad. I mean... You're my big little brother. You're not my brother. Listen... I'm sorry for scaring you like that, jumping out of the tree. I felt rotten about it. Anybody could know that. Hey, d'you think it's easy for me to believe that you're David? I mean you should be like 20 years old now. I'm not really sure why I kept this. I guess I thought maybe I'd be able to use it. And it would kind of save the day. Mum and Dad went nuts when we couldn't find you. They made me put those things up on every telephone pole and tree for years. Every Saturday. You should have seen Mum. She kept all the stuff in your room. She refused to believe that you were dead. It's 1986, man, eight years since that night. Little weasel. Dork. Buttface. - Scuz... - BOTH:...bucket. Jeff... I'm scared. We'll figure something out. - Dad! I wanna go home. - Yeah, I know, David. We want you to come home too but the doctor wants you to stay in the hospital a couple of days. No, Dad. Please don't make me stay. We have to find out where you've been. He wants to run a couple of tests to help you remember and we thought that was important, Davey, so we said OK. Mum? Oh, honey, one of us will be with you around the clock. Nothing bad's going to happen to you, I promise. Now... You two guys, you go get some sleep. I'll stay with our guy tonight. OK, right. Well, we'll see you in a couple of hours. Bye. Be cool, dude. Mum... Have I really been gone eight years? Yeah. It's like a bad dream. (DISTORTED VOICES) ...thyroid hormones suggest a great many factors could influence, one of... He's hurt! He's calling me. What is it? - Nothing. Forget it. - No. What? Well... This voice keeps calling, saying something over and over and over but I can't understand very much. Well, what is it saying? Something... I can't explain it. I knew you wouldn't believe me. No. I believe you. You don't think I'm going crazy, do you? Are you kidding? They've run a million tests on you. In fact, you're probably the only sane person in this place. Don't worry about it. Just a bad dream. Thanks. Have you tried everything? Everything, sir. It's completely impregnable. I must get inside. For all we know, something may be living or perhaps even dying inside this. It appears to be seamless. No way in, no way out. David, what time did you enter the woods? Around eight o'clock. Then you met your brother? Yeah, the jerk jumped out of the tree and scared me. He's lucky he's still alive. Then what happened? Well... I chased him for a while. Then I reached this cliff. Jesus! He's transmitting in alpha waves with complex frequency patterns in them. - What's going on? - I don't know. I kn... I know I fell. The alpha waves are coming in at 12.78 cycles per second. He's communicating directly with the computer in binary code. How the hell is he doing that? I have no idea. But then after you fell... you went somewhere. How did you get there? MUM: What is that? Is that coming from David? I believe it is. Well, what is it? How did I get out of the ravine? I crawled out. Let's see the gas checks now. CO2 sensors... Dr Faraday, I think you should take a look at this. Where did this come from? From the mind of a 12-year-old boy. David, what do you think? No way. I'm not going. I don't think you understand the importance of this situation. I don't care if it's a matter of national security. If David says no then that's it. But David would get treatment from the best specialists in the country, not to mention technical capabilities this hospital is not prepared to offer. - Am I correct, Doctor? - It's true. We've done everything we can for him here. Excuse me. I know that all sounds great but the fact is that David has to go on living and he can't do that in an institution so until you can tell me something that makes one ounce of sense, then we're all going home and that's all there is to it. - Right on, Dad. - Yeah! I'm sorry you don't want to know the truth. What? The truth about where David's been for the last eight years. Why he can't remember. What all this unusual brain activity means. And most of all... Why he hasn't aged. David...I can offer you the truth. All I need is 48 hours, just two days, at the base with me and my staff, alone. No confusion, no distraction, and then, David, you can go home and put all this behind you. It's what you want, isn't it? Yes. (DISTORTED VOICES) Who said that? Who said what? Never mind. (DISTORTED VOICES) Well, David, this'll be your room for a while. What d'you think? Is this stuff for me? Yes, it is. There's no phone in here. I thought I was supposed to be able to call my parents. We'll make that call together first thing tomorrow from my office, OK? Now look, if you want to watch TV, this is a remote control wand. We'll get you something to eat right away, OK? Now, here's a special gift, just for you. Tomorrow's going to be very exciting so you enjoy yourself and... we'll see you in the morning. Hey! TV:...Americans out there who need and want to lose weight and what we'll try and do is help them here. Now let's restrain ourselves. Let's get back to the basic subject. What can your diet do for Americans? - ♪ And if it is don't mind me saying... ♪ - (CRASH) Pardon me. Coming through. Get away. Hi! I'm Carolyn McAdams. You gotta be real hungry after your trip, right? - What is this thing? - That's RALF. - RALF? - Mm-hm. Robotic Assistant Labour Facilitator. Actually what he does here is he delivers mail and supplies and he messes up a little bit every now and then. So... Who did you murder to get put here in maximum security? No-one. I'm a national security secret. Oh! Well, in that case, I shouldn't be talking to you at all. Wait a sec. Um... How come Starsky and Hutch isn't on? That show was cancelled a long time ago. That was my favourite show, and what's this stuff? You've never seen a music video before? Uh-uh. I've been gone for eight years. Gone where? Outer space? Could be. You know something? You're a weird kid. Me? I'm not the one with the purple hair. Oh, yeah. I went to a concert with some friends last night. Really? My mum took me to see the Bee Gees a couple of months ago. Who d'you see? Twisted Sister. Never heard of her. It's a him. - Oh. - Actually, it's a them. You're serious about being away, aren't you? What was it? Like a coma or something? I can't remember. All right, listen. Um... I gotta go. Is there anything else you want when I come back? How about a Big Mac, large fries and a Coke? They're still around, I hope. Well, now, that all depends. Do you want new Coke, classic Coke, Cherry Coke, Diet Coke or caffeine-free Coke? Huh? Nothing. Forget it. If they're still around then I'll do my best, all right? - OK. Bye. - See ya! Come on, RALF! Come on, Ralfy baby! You'll make it, come on! - ♪ No, no, no, no, no, no - ♪ I don't want you to go ♪ I don't want... ♪ (DOG BARKS) All right! Pretty good! Jeff! David's on the phone. They gave me a NASA cap and there are robots here they call RALF. And there's a nice lady that brings me my food. Oh, and another thing. They locked me in my room. The locks are there for David's protection. - Don't take any shit, David. - Hey! Now, don't forget your promise, doctor. David has to be back in 48 hours. FARADAY: Don't worry, Mrs Freeman. Hi, David. It's Dad again. Hi, Dad. We're just... We're just here fixing up your room, waiting for you for when you get back and we'll see you soon. That's great. Thanks. We sure do miss you, son. I miss you too, Dad. I miss all you guys a whole lot. - Bye. - Bye. Bye-bye. Bye, David. OK, now, David. If you can... I'd like you to try and remember what happened when you fell in the ravine. Well... I tried to stop myself - but the... - (INTERFERENCE) Everybody remain calm. Try to bring it back up to speed. What's going on? It's all right, David. Everything's fine. We're ready, sir. OK. Bring the computers up to synchronisation slowly. Let's see if we can latch the data at a higher rate. What is your name? We're in sync. Wait a sec! How'd that happen? I didn't say a thing. Next question. David, where have you been for the last eight years? I've already told you, I don't know. What powered the craft that you were travelling in? (JUMBLED VOICES) Oh my God! This kid's head's full. What language is that? Who knows what's in this boy's head? What are you talking about? We could spend years trying to decipher it. Who's putting that stuff on the screen? You are, David. But that's impossible. How far is it from Earth to Phaelon? I've never heard of the place. How long did it take you to get there? Light speed theory. That's the only possible explanation. What's that? Listen, David. You were travelling beyond the speed of light. You could have been gone only 4.4 hours and the rest of us here on Earth would have aged eight years. Well, what does that mean? Time slows down as you approach the speed of light. Speed of light? David... ...where is Phaelon? How am I supposed to know? (JUMBLED VOICES) He's searching through star charts. (SPEECH INAUDIBLE) Sir, I think he's downloading. DAVID: Wait! My God! These are uncharted systems. Our computers don't contain this information. David, is this Phaelon? I don't know! Let me outta here! David! David! 48 hours is not going to be enough time. (FAINT DISTORTED VOICE) ROBOTIC VOICE: Pardon me. Coming through. Hi there! Hi, Carolyn. So, how's the testing going? Terrible. But at least I get to go home tomorrow. They told you that you're going home tomorrow? That's right. Why? Nothing. Carolyn. It's just I've seen the meal sheet for the coming week and they've got you on it. Until when? All week. But that's impossible! They promised it would only be 48 hours. You guys hear me in there? I want outta here right now. You think I don't watch television? Wake up. Hey. Come on, it's not as bad as it seems. How would you know? You've never been locked away from your family and been put in some awful place you hate. Yes, every time my father got new orders I had to go and I had to start all over again. (HE SIGHS) Maybe you're right. (WHISPERS) Carolyn, I've got to get outta here. David! Contact my parents, tell them what's going on, they're in Information. Hey, what's he doin'? Go see them for me. Please! Well, I gotta get back to work, OK? You know? You're cute. Did a girl ever tell you that before? Nobody but my mum but I don't think she counts. (DISTORTED VOICE) (DISTORTED) David? (DISTORTED) David? (WHISPERS) Yes. I'm here. (DISTORTED) Help me! Help you? How? (DISTORTED) Are you coming? Yes, I'm coming. Pardon me. Coming through. (DISTORTED) Get in the RALF unit. (LAUGHS) Full house! Got you again. God! I can't believe you. (UPBEAT MUSIC) (DOG BARKS) Hey, come on! We'll get you your own breakfast. Phew! (UPBEAT MUSIC STOPS) (WHOOSHING) Agh! ("SIT" IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES) - Who's that? - Sit down, navigator. Are you the one that's been calling me? Affirmative. You have the information I require to complete my mission. Sit down. I think there's been some sort of mistake. I do not make mistakes. Awaiting final vectors. Vectors? I don't have any vectors. I'm just a kid. That is obvious but your brain has been programmed with all appropriate star charts. You mean that's why my brain has been coming up with all that stuff? Yes. You are...the navigator. Holy... Campbell! Oh my God! Seal all doors, activate penetration recording. Activate all radiation surveillance consoles one through twenty. Switch control monitors to automatic. (SHOUTING) - Dr Faraday... - Troy? Somebody has penetrated security, sir. - They're in the hangar now? - Yes, sir. - How did this happen? - We don't know yet, sir. (SIRENS BLARE) - Can you tell what it is? - No, I can't see a thing. - Do you have radiation? - Negative. We show a cold room. All right. Get the goddamn door open. Now! We still have containment. Right, I want security doubled immediately. - Yes, sir. - You got that? Navigator, I detect alien life forms approaching. Aliens? Where? Observe. Those aren't aliens. They're human beings. Run! Uh-oh! I'm gonna get it for this. Oh shit! It's an alien. - No, you idiot. It's the kid. - David? Oh, great! They've got guns. Protective hover is advised. - Will that shut the door? - Affirmative. OK, let's do that, but if anybody asks, you're the one that did it, OK? Compliance. Now just...get out of the ship, son. (WHOOSHING) (WHOOSHING) (CREAKING) Request initial manoeuvres. I don't have any manoeuvres. I just wanna get out of here. You wish to depart hostile alien environment? - Yes. - Compliance. (SHOUTING) Wow! Did you do that? Elementary manoeuvre. I must complete my mission and return to Phaelon. I don't wanna go to Phaelon. I wanna go home. Navigator, I am awaiting your command. We must act now. Look I gotta think. Just take us 20 miles from here. Compliance. What are you doing? Let's get over to tracking. Stop! (THUD) Yah! Oh! You requested this distance. I didn't mean straight up. I meant along the ground. Oh. Sir, it just shot straight up at over mach 10 and stopped 20 miles up. Take me back! Compliance. Oh no! It's heading back. (CHATTING) - Here it comes! - Where? There he is. Wow! How did you do that? That was a third-class manoeuvre, navigator. Well, if that was a third-class manoeuvre, what's a first-class? Observe. - Look at that! - Oh! Uh-oh! This first-class manoeuvre allows me to slide through your planet's thick atmosphere. I can move at any speed, I can speak thousands of languages. I can analyse species from civilisations light years beyond your own. - Yeah, but can you fix the seat? - Compliance. That's great. Now could you slow down a little? Compliance. Cool! Would you like me to adjust the temperature? No. (COWS MOOING) We are precisely 20 miles from point of origin as you requested. You are wasting time. Give me the star charts now. Not now. I gotta go. - Go? Where? - To the bathroom. Do not know bathroom. Then open the door. Request explanation. Just do it or you'll be sorry. I'll be right back, I promise. Do not know promise. Damn! How did that kid get outside? We had security everywhere. Gonna get control of the situation. Sir, over here. There they are, about 20 miles west of here. Get some choppers out there immediately. (COWS MOOING) What are you doing? Can I have a little privacy? Do not know privacy. - (COWS MOO) - (IMITATES COW) What are you doing here anyway? I have been sent from Phaelon to borrow samples of life from different galaxies for study. On this planet I chose you. Why me? Why not? Back on Phaelon we discovered that your inferior species uses only 10% of your brain so we filled it all the way up with star charts to see what would happen. What happened? It leaked. - Navigator... - I am not a navigator! Yes you are. I crashed into electrical towers and my star charts were erased. I need the ones in your head to complete my mission. So you need me and my inferior brain to fly that thing? Correction. I need the superior information in your inferior brain to fly this "thing". Well, if I'm so inferior, how come you took eight years to bring me back? Normally I take my specimens back in time to the exact moment and place I collected them. Come on! You took me away from my family and when you returned me it was eight years later. Everything's changed except me. Unfortunately we discovered it was too dangerous for your fragile human body to travel back in time. OK, if I can't go back in time, at least take me back to my family. Come aboard quickly, navigator. Not until you promise to take me home. We spotted him. - The boy's outside the ship. - Can you keep him on the ground? Very well. You give me the star charts and I'll take you home. Come on, let's get outta here. He's gone back into the ship. Don't let them take off. - Request instructions. - I don't know. - Just get us outta here. - Compliance. My God! It changed shape. Can you follow it? Follow it? I can't even see it. Hey! This is fun! Fun, navigator? My name's David. - David? - Yeah. So what do I call you anyway? - I am a trimaxion drone ship from... - Trimaxion? - Affirmative. - OK, I'll call you Max. It's easier. - Max? - Right. Just take me somewhere where they can't find us. Compliance. What are you doing? Agh! I didn't say take us under the ocean. All I asked for was a place they couldn't find us. This was the first place suggested by my data banks. Will this thing leak? Navigator, I do not leak. You leak, remember? Hm... I must programme my circuitry for the mind transfer. - (VARIOUS ANIMAL SOUNDS) - Wow! What are these? Those are the other specimens we studied on Phaelon. Where do they come from? Don't touch! That is a Gar-puntle from South Petraulis. - Oh. - Once he bites, he never lets go. What's this? That is a Feena-Starus from the Pixar Elliptic. Weird. What are they doing here? After I drop you off, I will travel back in time and take them to their homes just as if they never left. (CROAKING AND SQUELCHING) What's that? A very unpleasant little creature. What's his problem? He's got a cold. Eugh! Gross! (SQUELCHING) Don't get too close, David. They're hungry. Ugh! That could have been your head, David. (IT BELCHES) (ECHOES) What's in here? Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai! Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai! What's this one? That is a puckmarin from Binpuka Minor. He's not dangerous. (MUTTERS NONSENSE) Can I hold him? Just keep him quiet. I'm concentrating. Hey, little puckmarin. How long have you been here? (MUTTERS NONSENSE) What's he saying? He is angry because I won't take him back to his home planet. He does not know it was destroyed by a comet. - That makes him an orphan. - (CROAKING) I wish I could take you home with me. Jeff would really flip out. (CROAKY LAUGHING) - Listen. He's laughing. - What is the purpose of laughing? The purpose? I guess it makes you feel happy. You should try it. (MAX LAUGHS) Nothing. No sign of them at all. That's wonderful. Just lost two of the most important discoveries of the 20th century. - (PHONE RINGS) - What else could possibly go wrong? Sir, it's the kid's father. Hm. Faraday. Dr Faraday, how's David? Well, actually, Bill, it's been kind of a rough day for all of us here. Ah. Well, is he there now? Can I talk to him? Um... Well, he just seemed to want to have some time to himself, you know what I mean? Well, just tell him to call me as soon as possible. Will you do that? Sure! I will be glad to have him call you as soon as I see him, OK? OK, bye-bye now. Who was the last person to see David? Carolyn McAdams. She's an intern on the base. Well, get her here. I want to talk to her right away. - Her shift ended about an hour ago. - Just find her! Yes. Got to keep a lid on this somehow. I am ready to perform the mind transfer. Sit here, navigator. - Will this hurt? - You will feel nothing. - Will I remember everything? - You will retain all data. How many times have you done this thing? Zero. Zero? You mean never? I'm not gonna let you try this out on me. What if you fry my brain? - I will not fry your brain. - How do you know? I have been programmed with superior intelligence. - Lie down. - OK. That's it? That's it, Davey! Davey? If you wanna learn to swim, you gotta jump in the water. Don't forget to feed Bruzer. Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun. Whoa! This can't be happening. I got some stuff out of your head that has nothing to do with navigating the ship. You sound just like a human. No! That dumb dog will never learn to catch a frisbee. You are an inferior species, you dumb dork. - Buttface! - Scuzbucket! Hey! Well, if you're so perfect what are you still doing here? I told you. I blew a fuse when I totalled out that electrical tower. I was checking out some daisies. - You crashed while looking at flowers? - Ha! - Sounds like you're the inferior species. - I'll show you who's inferior. Heads up. Hey! Take it easy! - Well, excuse me! - (STRANGLED SOUND) You OK? Why are we going way up here, you geek? Geek? I swear to God, if I was flying this thing we'd be home by now. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. OK, turkey. You fly it. OK, quit fooling around. Come on! This isn't funny. Do something. - I take it back. We're equal, OK? - Equal! You called me a geek. You're not a geek. Max, I want you to turn on all engines now - that's an order from your navigator. Oh, now you're a navigator, so navigate already. Looks like it's out of control and falling. - Somebody shoot him down? - I have no idea. Better do something, big shot. You weren't even trying. Come on, one of these has to start it. (IN SCOTTISH ACCENT) Scottie to bridge. She can't take much more of this, captain. 20,000 feet and falling. You're getting warmer. Boiling, scalding, red hot. Uh-oh, cooling down, Arctic, - sub-zero, freezing. - (SQUELCH AND GROAN) Oh, real coordinated. You'd better hurry. Pull up. Impact in less than 15 seconds. You hockey puck, it's right under your nose. Wow! Yeah! He's pulled up. Now, if I can only steer it. No way, Jose. - Wow! - Lucky guess. You nearly killed me. You are the one who almost crashed. I just shut down to teach you to fly. You liar! Am not. You did it to get even with me for what I said. Did not. You'll get yours. Oh, a threat. Oh, I'm really scared. Look! I'm shaking. You know... It's not real hard to fly this thing. Duh! The slightest little move of my hand and we go that way. OK, which way to Fort Lauderdale? I only know what's in your head and you don't know the way from your house to a 7-Eleven. I say we go right. You also don't know your left from your right. - We go left. - OK. Dr Faraday? We've located the McAdams girl. She's inside the boy's house with his parents. Keep them in that house. So right now he's up there somewhere flying around inside it. Inside a spaceship? - Oh, my God! - Wow! Faraday had the ship inside a hangar at the base and all I know is that it took off with David inside it. Oh, Bill, what are we gonna do? Faraday, that bastard! He's gonna wish he never met us. Dad, there are some guys coming toward the house. - Do you have a back door? - Yes, back there. It was nice meeting you all and I'll call you if I hear anything. - Hey, let go of me. - Sorry, Miss McAdams. I have to take you back to the base. Mr Freeman. Yes? Dr Faraday has requested that you remain confined to your house. DAVID: It's getting dark. That's not right. MAX: No, it's left! See, there's Miami. Come on. Let's go lower. I told you so. I told you so. That isn't Miami. It's Tokyo. How did we get here? - Oops! - OK, take us back up. Yeah, I knew that. I knew this was Tokyo. DAVID: You are such a liar. I am taking over. Japanese air command reports visual contact over Tokyo, sir. Tokyo? Sir, the target has left Japanese air space. Where's it going now? DAVID: Now we'll get home. First we'll hit California, then we'll go... Yeah, Mr Know It All, who got a D in Geography. - How d'you know that? - Ha-ha! I've told you that I don't know anything. I was just trying to be a friend to David. I really hope you're not hiding any information. I'm not hiding anything. Carolyn, we're just trying to bring him back. They're approaching the west coast. FARADAY: Already? Where are they? Heading for San Francisco. DAVID: Look! That's the Golden Gate Bridge. (MAX SINGS) Rice-A-Roni, the San Francisco treat. Don't get too close to those cables. Agh! Be more careful. I'm a precise machine. Relax, Max! (UPBEAT MUSIC) (MUSIC FADES) MAX: Are we there yet? Where are we anyway? Jeez, I have no idea where we are. Gotta get directions. - (MUSIC BLARING FROM CAR) - Mmm! (♪ DAVID KITAY: "Trapped in my Mind") I wonder if that's that Twisted Sister stuff Carolyn was talking about. - Come on! - Hi! You wouldn't happen to know the way to Fort Lauderdale, would you? Try to make your directions clear - because we get lost easy. - Floor it! Hey! Thanks for nothing! - Were those geeks, David? - Yes, Max. Those were geeks. That looked kinda like Texas. (IN TEXAS ACCENT) Well, partner, reckon we'd better head this wagon east. - David, what were those strange sounds? - Strange sounds? From the geeks' car. (PLAYS SAME MUSIC) Wow! That's called music. I wanna hear more music. Can you pick up radio waves? I'm equipped to receive over two million forms of radio waves. - I can monitor all frequencies... - OK, OK. See if you can pick up some signals that sound like what we heard. - (OPERATIC MUSIC) - How's this? No! That's not music. Try another station. - (SONG: "Blame it on the Bossa Nova") - Agh! Change it quick. (♪ BEACH BOYS: "I Get Around") Hold it!

Oink-oink! Too many Twinkies. Ha-ha! Excuse me, pal. Would you mind if my wife used the little girl's room? Dad, can we look at the flying saucer? Sure. Go ahead. - Jackie, isn't it weird? - Yeah! Your Indian village won't win any awards but that flying saucer's first rate. - How is it staying up? - I don't know. How long did it take to put something like that together? It's OK. We'll just take a look around ourselves. Look at this. I can push on the step and it doesn't move. Kids, get out from under there. They don't have insurance on places like this. Hello. Do you accept a collect call from David Freeman? Yes. It's David. We gotta talk fast. There's NASA guys all over the place. Jeff, keep the line free. David may call. Where are you? In Florida somewhere. I wanna come home but I don't know where the new house is. Can you please give me directions? Um... Do you know the drawbridge on 7th Street? No, I don't. Just give me a signal that I can see from the air. And don't let the NASA guys know I'm coming and remember, it's going to be dark soon. All right, if I have to set fire to the house... You'll find it. - Jeff, I... - (DIALLING TONE) TOURIST: OK, that's nice. All right. Jackie, move just a little bit... Good. Ryan, give me some smile. Come on, we're having a good time. I wanna get the ship in here. This is a nice shot. Honey, smile. Here we go. Excuse me. See you later, alligator. Ha! - Whoa! - Wow! Son of a gun! He just said he wanted to phone home. Wow! Look at this. (HE CROAKS) Highway 95. OK. We'll take that straight to Fort Lauderdale. 95? I think we should take the turnpike. I'm the navigator. Whoa! Take it easy, man. MAX: I'm the navigator. I'm the navigator! Well, Mr Smarty Pants, I thought Highway 95 would take us straight there. There it is! Now all we have to do is follow this and I'm home. The turnpike would have been faster. Come on down! Barbara Taylor! Come on down! (URGENT MUSIC) That's Miami Beach down there. We're almost home. Ha-ha! All right! Where do you go next, Max? Back in time to when I picked up my creatures. By now they're so hungry they could eat a zigzog. What's a Zigzog? Kind of like a hippo but with feathers. It's gotta be here somewhere. Aha! There you go. (TV STILL ON) (SIRENS WAILING) Sir, tracking says they're on their way up the Florida coastline. - All right. Step on it, OK? - OK. Faraday here. Can you pinpoint the location a little more precisely? It's rather general, you know? MAX: Is this Fort Lauderdale? Yes, but look at this! How are we ever going to find them? And now you're probably saying, "What do they have in store for me?" - An exciting trip to Canada! - (CHEERING) Damn! I don't believe this! (MUSIC BUILDS) Where are they? Come on, Jeff. Where's that signal? Oh! It's them! I knew you'd come through, Jeff. Ooh! Pretty! Can you see him yet? Not yet. We made it! MAX: We made it! Thanks for the great ride, Max. It was lots of fun. It was fun for me too, David. My friends are never going to believe this. Oh yeah. My friends are all 20 years old and I'm only 12. I'd like to take you back to your own time but it's just too dangerous. At least now you'll be safe and sound with your family. (SIRENS BLARING) JEFF: Look! Oh no! What are all those trucks doing here? Why can't they just leave me alone? I know what you're thinking. You're afraid they're going to take you away again, aren't you? Yeah. I'm sorry I got you into this mess. Attention all personnel. Keep your distance from the object. There may be radiation leakage. (CHATTING) - David! - Wait! - JEFF: Mum. - FARADAY: Keep her back. He may be in danger. Don't make any sudden moves. - Unit one, circle around behind the boy. - Roger. Wait until he's clear before you move in. I think we can isolate him. David, come away from the ship. - Come on! - Come on, David, please. Goodbye, Davey. - Come on, David, hurry. - Come away from the ship. I'm sorry. I don't belong here now. I love you. Take me with you, Max. You know I can't take you. It's much too dangerous. - David! - Please, David! You must stay with your family. That is my family but it's not my home. My home is back in 1978. If I stay, those scientists will treat me like a guinea pig for the rest of my life. If you go back in time with me you could be vaporised. I have to take that chance. - It's very risky. Are you sure, David? - Yes. Let's do it. All right, if that's your decision. Max? Will I ever see you again? I don't know. We must start the journey. Hold on tight, Davey. I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. Thanks. No big deal, really. Come on. Let's get outta here. Compliance. Navigator. Good luck. (WHOOSHING) (BUBBLING) (CRACKLING) (CREATURES CALLING) (TRAIN HOOTING AND RATTLING) Hey! David! Come on, let's go! Come on! Now watch, I'll write your name, J, E, F, F. Pretty tricky, huh? Don't get Bruzer. - Oh, Bruzer! - Here, wanna try that? - He looks OK to me. - Honey, be careful with the dog. Hi there! Oh! Where have you been, young man? Come on. - Give me that line there too, would you? - All righty. Mum? I love you. Why, thank you, sweetheart. What brought that on? (BRUZER BARKS) Bruzer. You mad at me? No, Jeff. I love you too. OK. - So which way are we heading? - I made reservations at the Sea View. - (PARENTS CHATTING) - (PUCKMARIN CROAKING) All right, gang. Let's go. Sh! (HE CROAKS) MAX: Ha! Ha-ha-ha! (VARIOUS ANIMAL NOISES) MAX: See you later, navigator. Ha-ha!
