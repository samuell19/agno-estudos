"Shadows of Love" Paris... Will you really come back? If it goes on like this, I'm afraid I won't stay faithful to you This is a breaking news report: An avalanche hit eastern Korea this morning The number of casualties is still unknown This is Korea's worst avalanche in 30 years Since the ski resort Dragon Gate is nearby, tourists might be buried in the snow A rescue operation is underway Mr Kwon, any news about Paris? We're all so worried! I called her many times but no one's answered yet I'm Kwon Jung-hoon Today is the worst day of my life Come back as soon as possible The office is a mess Everyone's discussing the avalanche I can't I booked her the hotel hit by the avalanche Don't tell me... What should we do? Book me a flight to Daegu. I must find her What? The road is snow-blocked I heard it's 8m deep Go book me the flight right away Sure, I'll book you the flight right now I'm already on my way to the airport Tell me right now Do you support Dong or me? Why must I choose? I just don't want the company to split up Come with me to Korea, or we break up Be more mature! Don't be so stubborn Listen up! It's either Dong or me! Either him or me! That's not good for the company OK then. You stay here I'm off to Korea to pitch other shareholders Don't come with me Regarding my trip to Korea, I dare to you tell Dong! Paris... Let go! Paris... Paris... Hello Beautiful! Qin Xin You brought me flowers again! Please sit Oh, and you bought so many things Are you on leave today? This is Granny She and Grandpa had a legendary romance Granny is very fond of me She says I'm very like her Come It's clean Have some tea What program are you watching? Japanese drama That's a hit! It's fabulous. I watch it every day Paris What's with you? Aren't you in Korea? Why didn't you answer my calls? You got the wrong person, sir What's the matter with him? Is he a looney? But he's quite cute for a looney I don't mind you playing with me You know there's an avalanche in Korea today? I was worried you had an accident! I don't even know you. Why should I care? The probability of 2 people looking identical is 49 out of 1 million Who said that? Ridiculous! Sorry, you look exactly like my friend I'm so eager to find her I mistook you for her This is my name card I'm lucky I resemble someone you're tracking If I resembled someone you want to beat up, I could be doomed! Hello What should we do, Mr Kwon? Mr Dong is looking for Paris You haven't boarded yet? Ask Derek to greet him as if nothing happened I'm off to Korea now Don't go. The company needs you Or Mr Dong will do whatever he pleases OK, I'll come back right away I like east meets west This is Dong An old fox Since he founded KNC with Paris's father, he's been plotting to buy it out with foreign capital so he can become the major shareholder Only Paris can overpower him Mr Kwon, any news about Paris yet? Mr Kwon Mr Kwon Excuse me He's a pain in the ass, you take care of him How's Paris? The Korean HQ has deferred the board meeting I wasn't told Many matters in the office are being deferred How can the takeover be deferred? I heard you proposed the deferment I better discuss this with Paris in person She's in the US. Not sure when she'll be back Takeover and restructuring are big issues It's good to think it out a bit more Think it out? Do you have second thoughts? Don't be silly You're so competent. I'm always your fan Let's wait for Paris's return for further discussion After restructuring, KNC will be quite different Let me remind you, don't ever... join the wrong team If Paris still doesn't show up, according to the bylaws, the Board shall be chaired by me Anyhow, let's decide at the end of the month OK! Only you and I are familiar with Korea here Do me a favor If you have any news, contact me immediately You better take off immediately Yes, Mr Kwon. I got it So pretty! How are you today? Happy? Wait... Let me take a close-up first I'm Qin Xin. I help my cousin sell flowers This is my other cousin He's inherited the "Romantic DNA" in the family Basically, his IQ is zero Only when his girlfriend needed chemo for her cancer did he know it's hard to earn money for the wedding Top 50 Any discount? Look at this one It came in yesterday. Only $7,888 Yes, discount for you My cousin is also a sentimental soul After her husband died in a car accident, she decided never to marry again Hurry UP! What time is it? Still moving one pot at a time Deliver the flowers before they've wilted! You're not in top form today Sorry, no pictures So pretty! How are you today? Guess what I heard, Sis? This cousin is even more moonstruck His IQ is less than zero His girlfriend often maxes out his credit card I'll buy you a limited edition bag next month He once gave his girlfriend a pot of flowers She thought there's a wedding ring inside They almost broke up On my way here, I heard a Korean company would develop our area We've hit a jackpot! Is it KNC? I got a letter early in the morning today YEAH! Why are you so happy? If I'm really lucky, Julian could become an international florist, with branches in Hong Kong, Beijing, Seoul...! And I... ...have inherited Granny's DNA, namely a hunch for bad things, especially about people I love No... You think you can act willfully because you're rich? I've been living here for more than ten years What are you building? A science research center? I won't leave even if you're building a nuclear plant Even if I die, I must die here You can't do anything about me! Money isn't everything! When I saw the way Xin looked, I knew it's over Sorry! It's not your fault It's just me being unlucky Mr Kwon, Mr Ke is getting much worse He's worried about KNC and his daughter If you find Miss Ke, please ask her to see him immediately We've done all we could medically If Paris still doesn't show up, according to the bylaws, the Board shall be chaired by me "Julian Florist" Let's have breakfast! Why are you so skinny? Eat more It's my turn Good morning Welcome Good morning Are you kidding? He came to the florist for me? Feel free to browse around It's the looney! You think I want another lecture? For the sake of KNC and Paris, I'll be the looney! Let me Who are you looking for? Excuse me, can I talk to her? You can talk to me Call the police Please don't Hear me out... A friend of mine is a spitting image of her I'm Kwun Jong-hoon of KNC. My name card I have her pictures in my phone Look Look I'm far-sighted I'm short-sighted I'm astigmatic Let me see Her father is dying in sick bed Maybe I shouldn't go. Let's go back Take this as an audition If your disguise is discovered in the company, you won't need to see your dad in the hospital Paris' dad My dad is very healthy! Welcome back! Thank you! Lovely! The heels are so high. I must hang in there I cannot sprain my ankle in front of them What do you think? I was thinking about my acting just now Very good! Give me five! Yeah! Yes! Thanks. We'll visit your dad later... Paris' dad! Oh yes! Can you play Paris for one more week? Why? To stabilize the morale in the company so I have time to find Paris Forget it! It's already too nerve-racking I can't handle it. Let's forget it I'm serious. Just give me your terms OK, I have one condition But no bargaining No matter what buildings KNC will erect, you must spare our florist OK, I promise! Daddy, I'm OK Don't worry about me You'll be fine also Brother! Mr Dong Paris? Paris... Uncle Dong is here Hello! Oh my God! I miss you so much! Paris was ill in the States She hasn't completely recovered She'll pay you a visit in a couple of days Let me see him He's still not feeling well If anything bad happens, KNC will be seriously affected, right? Paris, what's the matter? Paris... Nurse How is she? What's the matter? Mr Dong, please go back first Is she all right? Mr Dong, please go back first I'll take care of her. Thanks! Paris... Please wait here. I'll fetch the doctor Paris! Yeah! Daddy, you'll be OK... Fortunately, your dad is OK Paris' dad! Yes, you're right Hurry! Baby, not that I don't want to buy it for you, but my credit card is maxed out this month Next month I'll buy a limited edition bag for you What frigging bag is it? How can you cling to such a bimbo? You crazy? You don't get it. When a man loves a woman, even if she wants you to buy her 100 bags, you won't think she wants too much; you'll only blame yourself for being useless No wonder I won't have a man in my life I'd rather stay a woman in my next life I'll bring you there You can help me I got nothing you want? Let's work hard together! You know why I do that? Why? I want the Woman I love to keep telling me "I want!" Whatever I'm really worried about her She's simply too nice to people That's true I'm taking off! Let me help you I'll help you Come You're really following him against my advice? There're all sorts of people in the world I tell you, CEOs are not that uncommon! He gave you his name card and you follow him? Don't worry Just let me help her father Her father is quite miserable I'll tell you a secret Whoever lies to me shall come to misfortune! OK, bye Bye See you Bye! Write me a letter no matter what, or how would I know you can save our florist? To be honest, I think... Paris is worth much more than a florist She finally spoke. Good! Very direct I understand Besides the florist, I'll give you $1 million in cash No bargaining I'll take you to buy some clothes You better not take your suitcase into the house I'll fetch it for you later All right? Just a random comment is worth $1 million? I won't earn as much if I sold flowers for ten years! Mr Kwon Hello, Uncle Zhou No suitcase, Uncle Zhou Uncle Zhou has seen Paris grow up Hello, Uncle Zhou! Miss, you're back? Be indifferent It's my home. Where else would I go? Mr Kwon says if you can fool Uncle Zhou, you're halfway there So Uncle Zhou is worth half a million. So where's your luggage? We left the luggage at KNC before coming here This way, please! You're such a liar You need to be slicker Or you won't be able to fool the butler I'll succeed under the tutelage of King of Lies What a huge mansion! Can you give me a map? I'm afraid I might lose my way Miss, afternoon tea is ready Uncle Zhou... Mr Kwon, an invitation card When was it delivered? This morning Hello, Mr Dong Jong-hoon, is Paris all right? She's much better. Thank you It's great she's OK She agreed to host the Charity Ball next week I got the invite, but Paris might not be well enough to attend She didn't come to see me, Meaning she agrees to the takeover She only needs to show up at the ball and everyone at KNC will be happy Besides, we all know Paris loves to dance She must come! I understand. I'll tell her Why should there be a ball? Paris, come here Now you know how shrewd Dong is? He's been suspicious all along If he's as shrewd as you say, shouldn't I skip the ball altogether? No way You promised to play Paris You must show up wherever she does Dong has seen Paris grow up He must be thinking of testing and exposing you at the ball So what should we do? I don't know Paris' history? Can you dance? Come on! Come on... I barely learned how to wear high heels, and now I have to dance? Sit down, Uncle Zhou Pardon? Sit down I sit down? Sit down please Paris, come here Uncle Zhou, Paris is going to publish a memoir She must've had so many childhood anecdotes Why don't you refresh her memory? Yes, tell us as much as you can... Tell us as much as you can remember All right! I'm not as old as I look. I'm only approaching 70 My memory is still great When should I start? Start from the very beginning? Her eyes were big and round at birth Her eyeballs rolled around. So smart! As if she was already several months old She got off the bed and checked out of the hospital. How amazing! This is Johnny. I asked him to fly over to help out Who knows he did fly over here! This is Xu Yuan She and Johnny met for the first time like this I only found out later Where's Ke's Mansion on Golden Peak Road? I know Take the road behind me all the way till the end Thanks May I have your name? Johnny said he had set a record He could find out the name and phone number of any new girl he met within 5 sentences How about this time? Just call me Goddess Nice to meet you, Goddess You had a French boyfriend when you studied in the UK Didn't you say I studied in the US? Now the UK? So did I study in the US or the UK? Right, it's different That's not bad already He has Alzheimer's! I'm almost 80, but I still have a good memory What else? We need to change the lighting. Please take a break Janet, inform Mr Kwon and other managers to attend a meeting at the office at 3 pm Put all the documents in the car I'll read them in the car. Go! She's not only a princess but obviously a queen! Memorize Paris' activities in recent years Paris! Paris! Quick, hide it! Don't let anybody know Go! Paris! It's your cousin Xu Yuan! Paris Hi Hi! Take a seat Paris, I heard that you're back So I rushed here to see you You miss her? Paris! What's the matter? Nothing? She cannot be Paris Paris never not wears perfume My God! I can help you as I know everything about Paris But I'll be very strict, as you don't look like her at all right now Mr Kwon, there's someone for you Shit, who's that? You're Paris Paris, you are Paris, okay? There he is "'8 you! Hi! You're way too late! I met a goddess who showed me the wrong way Come Paris, he's here to teach you dancing How are you? I'm Johnny Hi She cannot be Paris! You just came from abroad. How do you know? Come on! Paris is a great dancer. She doesn't need lesson You better do some homework! OK, listen up Everyone here must keep this secret for me OK? It hasn't been so lively here for a while! Uncle Zhou... Uncle Zhou, OK? OK! Sorry One more spin Two steps back. One, two One more spin Left or right? Right Remember it No, you're way too off Paris could dance better than you at 8 OK, you tell that Mr Dong I sprained my ankle and can't dance No, if I say that... Dong will pretend to be concerned and ask the best specialist to check on you You know what? Paris' forte is her unwavering determination to do whatever she wants to do In fact, I quite pity Paris So what if you own everything? Since the first day I played her, I've never felt she's happy Paris and I share the same forte Are you ill? I'm sure you can dance as well as Paris You just let her steal your limelight Who says so? I do I don't know how to dance Xu Yuan, you're such a great dancer! Remember, Paris never gives compliments Good dancers like you can only be a Libra or a Gemini These signs suit best for Sagittarius like me I'm a Capricorn, the nemesis for Sagittarius Have some water Yes, I tell you what, Paris never offers water to anyone I know, Paris never offers anything to anyone She won't offer help to anyone She's the Queen Can I secretly be Qin Xin here? OK Thanks Any news from Paris? The people I sent to Korea haven't found her The only consolation is that her name is not on the casualty list It would be ideal If Paris could come back before the ball That would be perfect Do you have a plan B? To have Qin Xin continue to play Paris, so Dong cannot be her proxy in the takeover case But Qin Xin would have to sign in the meeting That will be trouble We can only focus on the ball then Xu Yuan will go to the ball, right? Tell me more about Xu Yuan Tell me, please Tell me! OK, I'll tell you Xu Yuan's favorite is the dolphin. Go figure Qin Xin, remember Paris knows how to dress and she loves to dance She also pays attention to social etiquettes She even wears heels at home She can tell if vegetables are organic by taste But few people have seen her eat Paris needs coffee in every meal, with neither sugar nor milk Also, Paris doesn't like flowers as they remind her of funerals She only trusts one person in the company, and that person is Kwon Jong-hoon Dear Paris, Who knows how to translate Korean love letters? Paris I know Paris won't eat like me But I've danced for 8 hours and watched videos for 4 I also learnt to drink red and white wines Even 10 of Paris' diet meals won't fill me up Aren't you hungry? I don't eat much in the evening You're suddenly swamped with work Several shrimps are not enough Fill your stomach and go to sleep early I'll taste one too Don't put so much wasabi next time If Paris comes back, all hell will break loose I really want to see how alike they look Actually, not at all That's good then That is to say, we finally have a consensus What? The fake isn't that bad Frivolous! I know you're actually an Aries, the perfect match for Sagittarius How do you know? Kwon must have told you Dolphins! Real dolphins! It's really beautiful here But I think my flowers are more beautiful Look how beautiful my flowers are! I designed that It's me, not you It's mine, mine, mine! Mr Kwon Come, I've something to show you Smell the flower Isn't it aromatic and soothing? Paris will be happy when she comes back Paris is mysophobic She doesn't like to put flowers in her rooms Sorry Before Paris comes back, I'll restore the room to how it was That's true! If my room is messed up without my consent, I would be unhappy too I didn't mean that Anyway, before Paris comes back, can you let these flowers keep me company? I'm afraid of loneliness OK If you can let the flowers keep me company, can I have another request? Can I be myself again once in a while? Because if I stay in my role all the time, I will go crazy! Can I? So how much time do you need? Besides your sleep, OK, when there's nobody around, I can grant you 2 hours to be yourself again OK OK! Yes, yes! Sorry That's the best I can do OK Yes! I was only gone for a few days What is it? Who dared to put stuff in my room? What right do you have? Throw them all out! Every single shred! You dared to sleep in my bedroom and mess with my stuff? Who do you think you are? You really think you deserve to be Paris? Tell her that her dream is over Nothing here ever belonged to her From this minute on, I have 2 hours to be myself, to be Qin Xin again 2 hours of my own time, Qin Xin's time! Hello, is that Paris? You think he's still around? Sometimes, there are things you really cannot believe It happened to us before When you think of someone, that someone will really appear! Had it not been for your Grandpa, I would have died in the war In those days, almost all men were conscripted Grandpa escaped He wandered all alone in the war, surviving on tree barks and river water Most men could not hold up, dying of illness or hunger, or being eaten by wolves Grandpa was lucky Wake up! Wake up! Thanks Thank you My father is a doctor This herb is very good for you Are you Japanese? No, I'm Chinese After my parents died, a Japanese doctor adopted me This girl is quite pretty It's a shame she can't speak It's OK as long as that man accepts her We're out of firewood. I'll go chop some How is she? Let's go find out Bi Da, be careful of mines! She's not a mute. She's Japanese Bi Da, be careful! She only pretended to be a mute. She's Japanese! Go! What are you laughing at? What are you laughing at? He walked very fast. I was always behind him I liked to look at his back, his shadow I felt safe walking behind him I had a hunch I would see him again But why do I always have the hunch that everything will vanish? You cherish them, so you're scared of losing them In fact, there's still a lot in your life to be experienced gradually Miss Ke, the order you made last week has arrived There are still a few items on the way from the US I'm sorry Thanks I've chosen an evening gown for you It will be ready soon Miss Ke you're keeping your figure so well That's it, thanks Thanks Thank you When Paris wears her evening gown, she likes to put her hair up Sorry... Sorry Let me Paris, will you really come back? If it goes on like this... I'm afraid... I won't stay faithful to you! Where did you spend summer 2 years ago? Brisbane With whom? You, Daddy, and also Dong Remember, you always call him Uncle Dong Yes, Uncle Dong Who else? Who else? Kwon Jong-hoon Yes, right Does Paris have to remember everybody's name? But wherever she is, Paris needs to know first thing where Kwon is and with whom 24/7 surveillance. Must be hard to date like that! How does Kwon take it? He... Whatever you want to know, just ask me Speak of the devil! Here he is now! Sorry, but Dong won't ask such questions No need to apologize, Guardian Angel Guardian Angel! (Korean) You think it's fun to pry? Pry? How did I pry? You asked me to read Paris' materials You asked me to play Paris seriously so no one will know I'm a fake You made me stay in Paris' room You made me think I'm Paris So when I see things in the room, that's called prying? They are two different matters OK, please explain to me What can I see? What can't I see? What should I know? What shouldn't I know? What should I say? What shouldn't I say? So is what happens between you and Paris absolutely off limits to me? You know this has nothing to do with your mission Understand? Thanks, Boss I almost forgot True, after the ball, everything here is no longer mine I don't know what you mean by that? I'm rehearsing my dance and you're distracting me At least I'm Paris now Out of my room! Now! Par... Qin Xin! Please go. I don't want to rehearse. Thanks Hey! Stop the car! Be careful! Sorry! Don't say sorry Let's not fight any more Anymore? I'll split after the ball Don't say that again I'm not the real Paris you love How's Kwon in the last couple of days? I've convinced the Korean shareholders not to support the takeover You haven't answered me yet Paris, I really don't know how to tell you The less you say, the more I suspect Thanks for that Hi! I-li! Welcome to Julian Is there a Miss Qin here? I saw the pictures she posted on the web They are flowers. So beautiful! I want to learn more She's on vacation abroad I'm her cousin Hello How can I help you? We have a delivery for you Sis! What are you here for? We have a delivery from Miss Qin Where should I put it? Put them all here Put this one over there. Yes So many? All brand names! You know when a man feels most like a man? When he can satisfy the woman he loves Tian Fang will look pretty in this wedding gown Too bad she cannot wear it and stand up to take a picture with us! Silly boy! Your Miss Qin really knows how to shop I wish she were here I could ask her to pick some flowers for me Flowers, go This is her favorite flower It looks like a collection of hearts Qin Xin is very kind-hearted Look how much she's given us What happened? I... I was about to give you your wages when I discovered a new deposit of... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 zeros... One million bucks! This is for you Thank you They are so pretty, don't you think? Paris called and said... she's coming back She asked me not to tell anyone But after much deliberation, I feel obliged to tell you Does Kwon know? I think, in comparison, you deserve to know more Thanks I'll leave here tomorrow Don't worry I've promised you I'd take you back to the florist to care for you I have a present for you Why are you giving me a present? These earrings look beautiful on you They're specially designed for you 1,2,3,1,2,3 I thought you really bought me a present Paris! OK, let me try how fun these earrings are Paris... Paris... We don't have much time left After the ball, I'll take a trip to Korea Aren't you supposed to go anyway? And I will go back to the florist During the days at KNC and in Ke's mansion, I know... it's been hard for you It's not really that hard Qin Xin, thank you I will never forget you I hope you'll remember Kwon Jong-hoon too Yes... Had you not reminded me, I almost forgot What's your name? I really can't remember It's like when you have a dream and can't remember a thing when you wake up It's like nothing has ever happened Qin Xin, I love you I think I've fallen in love with you Qin Xin, why did you come see me so late at night? Look! Your eyes are swollen with tears What made you so sad? After tomorrow, my mission for him will be accomplished As for my 3 cousins, I've helped them But... you have your rewards too If you call these my rewards, I'd rather not have them From the get-go. We're from two different Worlds Say, how can a bird end up together with a fish? Grandpa and I spoke different languages but we managed to stay together, no? I know you still miss him, right? I'm absolutely sure he'll be missing me too Bi Da! Don't speak! Don't speak! Stop talking! Sorry I need to join the war I feel that my life is without regret, having met a man worthy my love Isn't that the same for you? It's OK if your heart is overstuffed, as long as it's filled with things you like Having loved and lost is better than not having loved at all This way, please Thanks Thanks Cheers! Can you hear me? Loud and clear This is Xu Yuan. Clear for me too Good. Have you got off the car yet? Miss Ke... Heard you were caught in the avalanche in Korea Thanks for your concern So what was that all about? This is your first appearance. A few words, please Wonderful evening! Thank you. Thank you, everyone Paris, you're back? You OK? Annie, thank you. I'm good. Don't worry You really OK? Paris is standing right in front of you! Excuse me. I need to bring Paris to see Mr Dong Paris wasn't in Korea... Paris actually was in the US She wanted a break. She was back last week You look gorgeous tonight Are you praising me or Paris? I can't even tell the difference You've surpassed my expectations Paris Uncle Dong Thanks for inviting me to the Charity Ball I'm so happy to see you You know I was so worried about you! You must promise me the first dance I have so much to tell you Of course You are as pretty as you are competent All 5,000 of the staff at KNC worship you KNC already has a staff of 8,400 KNC has developed rapidly We have a staff of 8,400 already Oh that's right Seeing how ill your dad is reminds me of the days when he and I would share a bowl of noodles They met when they studied in Japan Dad told me you were studying in Japan then They both launched their careers in Tokyo Time flies Paris left Japan at the age of 6 I was 5 or 6 years old then And now, I'm dancing with Uncle Dong You look more and more like your mom Hurry! Give her the cue! I never met Auntie It's a shame I was so little when Mom had a plane crash I simply don't recall how she looked Sorry I shouldn't have brought that up. Sorry Bravo! Bravo! It's OK. Thanks for your concern, Uncle Dong I'm going back to the US the day after tomorrow Want to come with me? Let me think about it You are wonderful! I'm actually enjoying it Now everyone believes Paris is back Dong can do nothing about it What's wrong? Paris! Paris... What's wrong? What's wrong? Let me go check So you are Qin Xin? You can go now Let me remind you, you have nothing to do with KNC or the Ke's any more I understand Actually, I really have to leave right now You're not needed here any more, not even as my shadow Ladies and gentlemen We have received a total donation of at the Charity Ball this evening $ 20 million We've arranged a big cheque for the signature of our Chairman, Paris Miss Ke, this way please This way, Miss Ke Thank you Over here, thank you A picture of you together OK This way, to the left. Thank you Please stand closer Yes, thank you Thanks This way, thank you Another one, another one The chairman of KNC Thank you, Uncle Dong Paris bumped into Qin Xin at the entrance Where's Qin Xin? She left Qin Xin, where are you? Qin Xin May we have the CEO of KNC, Mr Kwon Jong-hoon Paris Paris Uncle Zhou, throw everything away that doesn't belong to me Yes, Miss Restore my room to its original condition Paris We'll pack and return them to her Are you returning them... or are you? She came here to help us She's a good person Miss, that lady... I better shut up Paris, we actually didn't mean to offend you OK, no need to pack I'm never coming back Paris... Paris! Get in back to my villa What? I'm not going with you She's in such a rush. Something must have happened Get into the car Paris You can't ask everyone to listen to you 24/7 I'm not asking This is an order Can't you be nicer to others? You should change a bit Nicer to others? Who's ever nice to me? I'm Paris I've been running KNC since I was little After my dad has fallen ill, I still have to support the Ke family Who can I rely on? OK, you want me to be nicer? I'd have been killed a long time ago! The fact that Dong cannot prevail today is because I've been relentless I can win I can lose But I cannot tolerate a draw I'm giving you 2 choices: 1) you leave with me now; 2) you go back to her I'm telling you I won't mistreat someone who loves me But I'll never forgive a man who betrays me Today, you've chosen to leave me I'll strip you of everything you have Paris, I'm sorry It's my fault to find a substitute for you Let me apologize to you Sorry! (Korean) You always told me you had a hunch you'd see him again I believe you're already with him happily You spent your whole life waiting for him You've finally made it! I asked you why my hunches had to do with losses You told me because I cherished what I liked so much I was scared of losing them I've fallen in love with a man I'm scared of losing him Now that we've split up, I still cherish him I finally understand Qin Xin I'm clear about my choice You are irreplaceable Even if I have to sacrifice everything, I'd still rather be with you and never come apart! I hope you know in the depth of my heart, you were never someone else's shadow! How beautiful! I, Yang Lin, take thee, Tian Fang, as my wife, my lifetime companion and my only love I, Yang Lin, take thee, Tian Fang, as my wife, my lifetime companion and my only love I, Tian Fang, take thee, Yang Lin, as my husband, my lifetime companion and my only love I vow never to leave you but will always follow you because wherever you go, I will go too Don't cast it yet... Her! Give it to her! Xu Yuan! Xu Yuan! Marry me! Marry me! So this is our story Some might find it unrealistic Some might find it ordinary But I think Granny was right I am really like her
