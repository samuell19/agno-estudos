[ Electrical Screeching] [ Man On Radio] Mother to Control. 15,000 feet, climbing steadily, Check. 15,000 feet. [ Man] Radar scanning correctly, sir. Mother to Control. Y-12 pilot transferring now. - [ Electrical Beeping] - Y-12 to Control. Are you reading me? Testing. Over. [Man On Radio] Reading you loud and clear. Switch on your instrument transmitters now. Over. Control, Control, I'm switching on now. Over. Check your recorders. Are you receiving signals correctly? [Electrical Humming] Motor recorder okay. Beam director checking okay, sir. - Pilot's heartbeat steady, sir. - Air friction recorder working correctly, sir. Electronic brain and gyros recording correctly, sir. Preparing to drop 7-72, 45,000 feet. Check. Ready and awaiting your countdown. [ Man] Ten, nine... eight, seven, six, five.» four, three, two... one, drop! Y-12 detached and airborne. Firing rocket motors. [ Man Speaking, indistinct] He's passing the previous highest. 10,000 feet. There's still the heat barrier. Will you speak with him, Commander? He's near the controllability barrier. It will be difficult for him. Control to 7-72, Control to 7-72, Do you read me? Y-12 to Control. Reading you loud and clear. Over. You are approaching controllability barrier. Steady as you go, and hold on tight,. [ Man ] Through controllability barrier Gyro stabilizers holding steady, - He's made it. - Good. - A big achievement. - It's great. Pilot's heartbeat steady, sir. Pilot's pulse checking okay. Control to 7-72, Control to 7-72, Do you read me? Over. Y-12 to Control. All sign of“G“ pressure gone. We have you at 230,000 feet. Check? - Check. - Now, hold on, boy. You're reaching the ionosphere. Your motor will burn out in exactly... five seconds. Check. [ Man] Four, three, two - That's the burnout. He's okay. Take it easy, Dan. We're reaching maximum test height of 300,000 feet. You're in modified atmosphere. She's riding steady. Feel as though I could go on. Test your controls and prepare to turn. Let her go, Chuck. See what she'll do. Think he's all right, Doctor? Heartbeat is almost normal. But with release of pressures, judgment may be unsound for some seconds. - Shall I take over on remote control? - No. Give him a few more seconds. Dan, do you hear me? I repeat, do you read me? Cannot direct hands toward stabilizers. Steady me. Steady me. Electronic controls, take all stabilizers. - I'm trying, sir, but I can't get equalization. - Keep at it. Listen, Dan, this is Dr. von Essen speaking. You are weightless. Without concentration, you cannot coordinate your senses, - Listen to me, - Tell me what to do, Doc. Tell me what to do. First, control yourself. Now, forget everything else, and watch your left hand. Without taking your eyes off it, put it down». until it is resting on something. No matter what. Take your time, Be quick, Doctor. lf he hits atmosphere at this speed, he'll burn up. [ Dr. von Essen] When you have hold with your left hand». do the same with your right, Bring it slowly forward until you can grasp the stabilizer, Watch carefully until you are steady, Now concentrate and you will regain control of Y-12. You're moving outside the preset radar position. We're going to lose you. Can't help it! Can't help it! I've got control, but I can't reduce speed! Radar control, Y-12 gliding outside preset orbit. - Track five degrees west. - Tracking five degrees west, sir. You'll never hold him. He's going! His only chance is to bounce the atmosphere until he loses enough speed. - Radar Control, keep tracking west! - Yes, sir Track west. Keep going! Keep going! Keep tracking! Well, if we don't hear soon, we never will. Why didn't he obey orders, stick to the test plan? He should have! You cannot blame your brother for this tragedy, Commander Prescott. - For a few vital seconds, he was not himself. - I wish I could agree with you, Doctor. We do not yet understand the physiological conditions... a man may have to endure at such heights. My brother's always been unpredictable. He's a heck of a good pilot, the best we ever had. Well, he knew the limits. Why did he disobey orders? It was a physiological condition clouding his judgment. Chuck, we've progressed a long way in the development of aviation medicine. But the conditions we simulate in the high-altitude test chamber». just aren't the real thing, - [ Phone Ringing] - It's like- Captain Richards's office. Commander Prescott speaking. What? ls the pilot all right? [Sighs] Now, where? Say that again slowly. Puerco. Yes, yes. I know the place - between Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Listen, don't let anyone near it. We'll be right over. We found 7-72, sir. Badly damaged, but in one piece. And Lieutenant Prescott? Is he safe? Yes, he's all right, - [ Man On Intercom ] Yes, sir? - Have Hyatt bring around my car on the double. - [ Man #2 On Intercom ] Salvage officer speaking. - Captain Richards. Team up the Y-12 crew. Get 'em loaded and have a salvage crane follow me to Puerco. I 'll radio directions, but get gain'. Well, Commander, looks like you're losing me another night's sleep. Afraid so, sir. Commander Prescott, U.S. Navy. Where's the plane? Just off the road over there. We're sure glad to see you. We're mighty cold and hungry. Should have been off duty a couple hours ago. Well, thanks for stickin' around. Where's the pilot? Oh, he's around here some place. The plane's just over here. Right. Thanks. [Train Whistle Blowing] Take it easy, Clancy. It's me, Witney, I brought the navy, - Huh. What in, a land yacht? - [Chuckles] - You see it come down? - Yeah, right down the valley. We took a quick look and radioed in to headquarters. - Where's the pilot? - The relief patrol took him into town. Into town? But he's okay. Sure. He looked like a man from Mars in that getup. [ Clancy] Talked sense, but he acted kinda loony, [ Dr. von Essen] What do you mean? [ Clancy] I don't know, Kind of high, I guess, But I'll tell you one thing - [ Continues indistinct] - I'll send in a report to you in the morning, sir. - Fine. Well, she's badly beaten up, but with any luck, the instruments might be okay. Let's hope so. Good evening, sir. Boy, that pilots the zaniest guy I ever saw, - How come? - He had me take him into town for a change of clothes. Said he had some dame to see. [Chuckles] - Couldn't even wait for coffee. - Well, I guess I know where that'll be. - Mind if I borrow the car, skipper? - Sure. We'll ride back with the salvage crew. - Thank you, sir. - Take it easy. [Engine Starts] Oh, Dan, I wish you were not a test pilot. It is so dangerous. Honey, it's my future. It's our future. Who's gonna forget the first man in space? They don't forget Lindbergh, or the Wright brothers. - You talk too much. - You can always shut me up. I will. [ Doorbell Buzzing] [Speaking Italian] Oh, don't talk with the macaroni. Answer the door. - Is Lieutenant Prescott here? - Yes. In there. But - Hiya, brother. Have a drink. What the heck's the matter with you? You just wrecked $10 million worth of aircraft, and I find you lollygagging around here. Why aren't you back at the base making out your report? As a matter of fact, I was just on my way. Okay, wise guy. Taylor. Escort Lieutenant Prescott back to the base... and inform the duty officer that he's confined to quarters until further notice, [ Taylor] Yes, sir. Now get HP! You can see how it is, honey. I'll phone you soon as I can. You can pull all the rank you want. You're very good at doing that. But just remember this: You couldn't pilot a kiddy car to cross the other side of the street. If it weren't for guys like me, you'd be dead! Nothin'! [ Door Slams Shut] Why did you treat him that way? Right now he has no business playing house with you. He's got a job to do and that comes first. Not always, Commander. Dan knows what he's doing. Does he? I'm not so sure. [ Door Shuts ] [Hammering] [Alarm Blares] - Why don't you quit ridin' the boy, Chuck. - He disobeyed orders. Y-12's a wreck and we were darn lucky to salvage the instruments. All right. But you got to look at it both ways. just think of the progress we made. Come in. - Yes, sir? - Simmons, take this to Commander Barrett. - Tell him I'll be there in five minutes. - Yes, sir. I got something else here you can worry about. We're putting Y-13 on a four-week countdown as of tonight. - Four weeks? - Yeah, the Pentagon just came through. - We're priority go-ahead. - Mmm. We'll be really sweating blood to get this on time. All right, then sweat blood and read your orders. I have an Apex to fire in 30 minutes. [ Rocket Engine Roaring] Look at that baby go. Isn't she beautiful? You're, uh, released on Captain Richards's orders. - It's about time. - That's not all. It seems the Pentagon is so impressed with your fame... that you're to pilot 7-73, That's great! But you're not so very happy about it, are you? I just want to be sure of one thing, that there are no mistakes - that you obey every instruction given to you. - Your reactions are slow up there. - That's not the answer I want! - What do you want me to say? - I want you to say that you understand... that you're the pilot, but I give the orders. Unfortunately, I think you'd do anything for this. - Get off my back, will you! - I'll get off your back... as soon as you realize that we're developing a piloted space plane... and not a record-breaking hero! All right. As I said before, your reaction is slow up there. Well, we'll see to it that you get plenty of time for a checkout... before the next flight. Dr. von Essen will give you a thorough indoctrination... so that your reactions are automatic. Now get your things together and get over to Aviation Medicine. Yes, sir. - Miss Francesca? - Yes? - What are you doing here? - I'm sorry, Commander, but I'm in a hurry. Wait- Chief, what is Miss Francesca doing here? Checkin' in some material with Dr. von Essen, sir. I don't understand you, chief. What sort of material? She's on Dr. von Essen's staff, sir. Aviation Medicine Department. I wish she was working here. I'm all for scientists in skirts. Hmm. You and the rest of the navy. Come in. Commander Prescott. Congratulations. - Y-13 should be a fine project. - Oh, thank you, Doctor. - Sit down. Cigarette? - Uh, no. No, thanks. Say, uh, Doctor, do you, um - Do you have a Miss Francesca on your staff? You do not visit us often enough at the university. - How long has she been working for you? - Some months. She has charge of the cardiographs... and probably knows more about your brother's heart than he does himself. Yes. From what I've seen, I wouldn't be surprised. She's good for him. He's quieter, calmer... and in love. In love? Are you kidding? You're too close to your projects, Commander. You do not notice people enough. - Are you sure of this? - I should not say it otherwise. Well, what do you know? [Chuckling] What sort of an idiot does that make me? Why in the heck didn't Dan say something? You don't seem to have your brother's entire confidence. No, uh, Doctor, I'm afraid I don't. You wish it were any other man than Dan who should pilot 3473? Well, he's not the man I'd personally pick for the job. - Why not? - I just don't think it's in his nature... to stay inside any organized pattern. It's not an unnatural characteristic to find in a man who risks his life for a new achievement. Maybe so. But on a project such as this, I'd prefer to have someone more reliable. Well, he will be in my care until you are ready for the flight. I'll pay some attention to his psychology. Yes, would you let the psychiatrists work on him, Doctor? Make him understand that even though he's up there in space, alone... he still has to obey orders. [ Man On RA. System] Attention all personnel». stand by for Y-13 rocket motor res ting. Y-1 3 tied down, Fueling completed. - Stand clear for test, Stand clear for test, - [Alarm Blares] [Engine Roaring] - Like to go over the flight plan again? - What, again? - I know it blindfolded. - I know. Let's go over it again, huh? Okay. Okay. We blast off at 45,000 feet, crash the heat barrier... out into the stratosphere in six seconds. Fifty seconds later, I break through the chemosphere. - And you switch off your refrigeration plant. - Check. But keep tracking me. Buffeting in Y-12 was so severe I couldn't read my instruments. - Oh, that and the controllability barrier. - Mmm,yeah, that's really tough. It's as much as you can do to hold on. You sure you can take over when you reach ionosphere? If you want to, we can take you past rocket burnout. No, no. That won't be necessary. Now that I know what to expect, I'll be ready. [Man On RA, ] Y-1 3 countdown, Zero minus 54 minutes. Repeat, zero minus 54 minutes. Well, von Essen did a good job. You look pretty good. Never felt better. I wish he was comin' today, though. I like to have him around. The air force has priority today. Y-13 countdown. AH personnel assemble,. AH personnel assemble for takeoff Well, good luck. And you take it easy. [Chuckling] Thanks, Chuck. But don't worry. I'll bring you back all the dope you need for 7-74, and then some. Come on. Let's go, huh? Right. [ Man On P.A.] Six, five, four, three, two, one, drop. Y-13 to Control. Y-13 to Control. “G“ pressure gone. I'm weightless. - But gyros holding steady - Okay, Dan, we're with you. Now check controls for atmosphere bite. I'm checking now. - Steady her up. That's enough! - Take it easy, Chuck. Approaching 500,000 feet. Check? [ Dan] Check,. You're doing fine, boy. Now, commence your turn in 15 seconds. Chuck, she feels like she'd go on forever! Stop talking! Concentrate! 580,000. 590,000. - 600,000. - [ Man #2 ] Your altitude is 600,000 feet Prepare to turn, Dan? Y-13. Y-13. Commence your turn immediately. No, sir, I'm going straight up. First man into space! Commence your turn! Commence your turn! - [Man] Sir, we Te losing contact. - Switch to remote control! Over to remote control, sir. - Dan, are you reading me? - So long. See you in space! - [Alarm Sounding] - Dan! Dan, are you reading me? Are you reading me? Remote control won't respond, sir. - He'll be out of atmosphere any second now. - He's still climbing. - The fool's fired his emergency boost! - [Alarm Continues Sounding] This is an emergency. Keep all radio beams open. Instruct all radar to keep scanning constantly. Bring in everyone. Warn all spotters. This is an intercontinental priority. [ Man On Radio] Yes, sir. [ Emergency Sirens Blaring] Well, he's on his own now. The first man into space. He'll either hit the moon or orbit the Earth the rest of his life. Control! Control! I've done it! 250 miles! I'm going to turn now. This is Y-13. Y-13 calling from over 250 miles in space. My rocket motors are burned out, and my gyro stabilizers cannot turn me at this height,. I'm going to use release mechanism to catapult myself and the nose away from the plane. Control! Control! Are you reading me? This is Y-13. Control! Control! Are you reading me? This is Y-13. Y-13 calling Control! I'm running into some meteorite dust! Pressing ejector button now! Wish me luck. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Si. Si. Kalinsky! Yeah. Yeah, sure. We'll take care of it right away. - Yes, sir? - Some Mexican farmer called Sanchez. He says he caught sight of a parachute floating down. It landed just outside his farm. I don't know, he says there's something like a front half of a plane... or something attached to the chute. - Where's he located, sir? -just off Route 17. About 10 miles south of Alvarado. You better get the nearest patrol car out there right away. - Yes, sir. - Meantime, I'll call the navy base. Might have something to do with their rocket firing. Hello. Get me the duty officer at the navy base. [ Man On Radio] Smash-up on the south highway,. Bus full of people and two trucks,. No report on deaths. Should have word from car 51 any minute now. - [ Man] Yeah. - [ Man On Radio] We got two witnesses,. - They're definite about the way it happened. - Uh-huh. Krupke's getting their reports now, and he'd like you to follow up, Yeah. Okay. Have him call me back. - Morning, Commander. Glad you could make it. - Morning. I'm Wilson, Assistant Chief of State Police. Well, thanks for phoning in, Chief. Uh, whereabouts is it? Oh,just up there a ways in the bushes. - Any - Anyone hurt? Any damage? - No. Dropped about a half a mile from the nearest farm. Came down like a dame in a feather bed. No sign of the pilot though, huh? Well, uh, you better come and look for yourself. Well, what do you make of it, Commander? I don't know. It's, uh, too early to say. Uh, I've never seen anything like this before. It'll have to go into the test lab. Well, the pilot's had it. That's for certain. - Smashed the canopy in. - Yeah, he couldn't live up there in space. - You got a minute, sir? - Why? Could you come up and take a look at what we've got up here? There's a farm. - You okay? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Salvage crew's right behind me. Oh, uh, look, will you have one of your men stand guard? I've got to go in to Albuquerque and make a call. - Oh, sure. I'll be here myself. - Well, thanks for your help. Always glad to help the navy. What's the trouble? Oh, it's this Mexican farmer. He's had a lot of cattle slaughtered for no reason I can see. - Well, let's go and see. - Okay. I knew this would happen. I didn't want him to go. Yes, I understand. How could you understand? - To you, Dan was just a piece of machinery. - Now, that's not true. You wanted him to risk his life. I had to put Y-13 into space and Dan as a pilot because those are my orders. - Orders! Dan couldn't exist unless he were risking his life. If he weren't piloting Y-13, he'd find his own brand of danger somewhere else. He had to prove he was the best. If you knew all this, why didn't you try and stop him? I did. I don't believe you. I've been trying to stop him ever since we were kids. He was always climbing the highest tree... or swimming further than anyone else. With Dan it was all the way or nothing. - He wanted to be the first man into space. - And he was. Before we lost track of him, he was higher than any man had ever been. Higher than any man. That's all you can think of. I wanted him to give up flying, to settle down. If he had, do you think he'd have ever been happy? No, you're right. I just can't believe he's gone. I've got to get back to the base. Will you be all right here alone? Alone - Yes, I'll be all right. Well - Chuck». I didn't mean to blame you,. Look, I'll, um, stop by the Aviation Medicine Department tomorrow... and see you if you'd like, Thank you. I'd like that. Good-bye, Tia. [Tools Whirring] [Hammering] We're, uh, running some metallurgical tests. It seems as if the skin was subjected to some sort of incrustation we've never heard of. Any idea how high he went? In weakened gravity pull, he could go a long way. Could be anything - 250, 350 miles. Chutes seem okay. The usual signs of scorching. Yeah. The, uh, automatic escape mechanism operated perfectly too. And this breaking chute opened just right, as soon as it hit full atmosphere density. But it was too late to save Dan. Nobody could live once the canopy burst. You'd be dead in a second. Have a look over here. This incrustation has some remarkable qualities. You see? Nothing. Nothing at all. X-rays will not pass through it. - No luck here either, sir. - Thank you. [Clears Throat] This is the infrared photograph. [Scoffs] But the rays do not penetrate to show us what is below the surface. And here under the ultraviolet lamp - I can't understand it. It's resistant to any identification or penetration test we can do here. We'll take a photograph anyway. There may be some reflection we cannot observe, though I doubt it. Hmm. So far, then, your tests are negative. Well, let's hope the metallurgical report will give us a line. - Let's hope. - Let me know as soon as you have it. Well, good night, Doctor. Good night, Chuck. - Good night. - Good night, sir. You know, you better get some sleep. I will, skipper. Thanks. What is this stuff, Doctor? Do you think a chemical breakdown could tell us anything? We do not even know the primary reactor. I'll send a sample to my own laboratory. We may find the answer more quickly. Yeah, I, uh -l can't get him out of my mind, Doctor. I can just see him up there now in the cockpit. He, uh, wanted you there today. Maybe if you had been - - lf only l had - - You mustn't blame yourself, Chuck. Maybe you're right. Look, I'll check with you first thing in the morning. [ Labored Breathing, Wheezing] [ Slamming, Banging On Door] - [ Gasps ] - [Bottles flattering On Hoof] [ Crashing, Glass Shattering] [Crashing Stops] [ Slurping] - [ Woman Screaming] - [ Creature Gasping, Grunting] Yes, I'll do that. Thank you, sir, and good-bye. Come in. Hi, Chuck. Glad you came by. I want to talk to you. Have you seen this, skipper? Uh, not the headline. Read further down. “In the past 24 hours... “death has struck in mysterious and terrifying ways. Type of wound inflicted is fearful and inhuman.“ Read the middle part, sir. It talks about the slaughtered cattle. That farm is right next door to where Y-13 fell. I've got a call in now to Chief Wilson. - I don't get the tie-up. - [ Intercom Buzzes] - Yeah? - Call for Commander Prescott, sir. Thank you, sir. Commander Prescott. Yes, Wilson. Where are you? Alameda? What? Yes, well, I'll be there as soon as I can. It's like I said, Commander, about the wounds on the Mexican's cattle. Look, this one's the same. It's like a tearing jag there across the throat. See? Mmm. Who or what could cause this wanton destruction? Well, I don't know, but it seems to like the taste of blood. See, it- it looks like it's been scooped up or something. And look here. Look. Takes more than human strength to do this. Unless he had an ax. - Chief. - Yeah? - Give me your flashlight, would you? - Sure. Look there. See on the edge of the wound there? What? Those little shiny specks. Oh, yeah, yeah. I see. That's funny. I never noticed those before. What do you suppose they are? When you do an autopsy, will you send a sample of that... to a Dr. von Essen in Aviation Medicine? Sure. Think they mean something? I don't know. But I'd like to take a look at that Mexican's cattle. Okay. We'll go over as soon as we're through here. [Cow Moos] Mmm. Well, there you are, Commander. Take a look. There's a dozen more like it in the lower pasture. Esta' muerta. Qué cosa terrible! Who want kill Clara? She win many prizes at feria. See what l mean? It's the same thing. The throat ripped right open. Mmm. Looks like it kills whatever it comes near. Yeah. You have any idea what sort of a weapon could cause such a gash? - No, not yet, but we're working on it. - Wait a minute. Shine your light. - Oh, yeah. Those shiny specks again. - Mm-hmm,. Would you send a sample of this also over to Aviation Medicine? Why, sure. What are you trying to say, Commander? That something from outer space came out of that missile? I don't know, but I'd like to have them compared... with the sample we took from the nurse at the blood bank. Okay. - You think it's gonna help us find the killer? - Well, I can't say. But let's hope we catch it before it does any more killing. Well, it can't escape my roadblocks forever. But if you've got any ideas, Commander, you've got to let me in on 'em. [Cow Mooing] Here. Lift that head. Yeah. What is it? Looks like a high-altitude oxygen lead. I've got to get back to the base. I've got a lot of work to do. - But don't worry. I'll keep in touch. - Yeah, sure. Pero, Señores, quieren pagar mi ganado? - I got to go now. - Okay. - I'll be back this way next Thursday. - Okay. [ Grow/mg] - [ Door Shuts ] - [ Truck Engine Starts ] - Don't forget to keep my side warm, - Don't worry. I won't let it get cold. [ Creature Grunting] - [ Driver Groans ] - [Blow Lands] Uh, hello, I'm Commander Prescott. I'd like to see a Miss Francesca. I'll see if she's free. They're just finishing an altitude test. Commander Prescott to see Miss Francesca. I'll bring him down. - Come with me, Commander. - Thank you. - [ Turbines Revving] - [ Beeping] Watch out for sphere density and final reactions carefully. Only 10 seconds to normal. [ Turbines Winding Down] Right. Open the chamber. [ Chamber Depressurizing] [ Man] Careful with his helmet, - Hello, Tia. - Hello, Commander. - Good to see you. - How are you feeling? All right. I've got plenty to do. It keeps my mind off of it. Yes, it does help, doesn't it? I was on the way over... to see about some blood tests the police sent over this morning... and I thought I'd stick my head in and say hello. That's very nice. Do you want me to see if they are ready? I'd appreciate it. Thanks. Pathological. Hello? Are those blood tests ready for Commander Prescott? They are? Could you please send them down? He's waiting for them. Thank you. Well, that's fast work. We try our best. - Do you want some coffee? - Yes, I would. Thank you. - Black? - Please. - Sugar? - No, thanks. I'm fine. You look tired. Yeah. Well, maybe this'll help. How did you ever end up in Albuquerque? I came with my father two years ago. He and Dr. von Essen were very good friends. They were at school together. And when my father died, Dr. von Essen asked me to stay on and help him. What part of ltaly are you from? Turin, from the north of ltaly. - Ever get homesick? - Not anymore. It's strange - The first time I met you, I thought - Well, it just goes to show you how wrong a person can be. - Do you want some more coffee? - No, thanks. That's fine. Thank you. “Embedded in both samples are innumerable particles of meteorite dust... “that show no sign of structural damage... “such as would be expected from passage through atmosphere. “Detailed analysis will be needed before a confirmed opinion can be given. A full report is requested on the origin of the dust.“ Has this got anything to do with Dan? I don't know. Look, Tia, I've got to get back to the base. I'll see you again as soon as I can. - Thanks for the coffee. - Good-bye, Chuck. We have the results of the metallurgical tests. Hang on a second, Doctor. I'd like you to take a look at this. Later, later. Come over here. I want to show you something. Well, uh- This is a sample of our new secret alloy... of which the fuselage of Y-13 is made. You know the terrific heat and pressure it will stand. This is a piece from the fuselage which was coated with this strange substance. Notice the metal underneath has not been affected. Now, this is a piece we removed from the stabilizer... that has escaped being encrusted. Look. It has undergone a complete transformation. It does not even retain a resemblance to metal. It's like, uh, crumbling carbon. And if I grind it... there's nothing left but powder. What could cause this transformation, Doctor? Difficult to say. Possibly cosmic rays we do not yet know or understand. And where it is coated, this transformation hasn't occurred. Right? Exactly. So then it could be that this is some sort of cosmic protection. Could be. [Man On P.A.] Commander Prescott, report to Captain Richards's office, please. Commander Prescott, report to Captain Richards's office, please, I'll, uh, be right back, Doctor. Although I accept your explanation, Señor capitan... there is no doubt that it was providence that His Excellency was not killed. But the place where the tail section of Y-13 fell... is 10 miles from your town. What is 10 miles, Señor; when you do not know where your missiles go? - What's he getting at? - He's referring to the rocket that almost hit Juérez. But that was a captured German V-2. It happened nearly 10 years ago. What is 10 years, Señor? You still do not know where your missiles go. He has the whole story, sir. The low-flying projectile you lost over Argentina last year... and the Apex missile that disappeared last week. That is so, Señor capitan, Where are they, eh? As if I knew. lf they're not up there, they must be down here. Glad you're here, Commander. Meet Sr. Ramon De Gareara, consul for Mexico at Santa Fe. Mr. Harold Atkins, State Department. Commander Prescott. Mr. Atkins. It seems that His Excellency, the minister for social services... was opening a new bull ring in San Pedro- Señores, it was the moment of truth. A great silence descend upon the crowd - 5,000 people. 10,000 eyes, Señor comandante, fixed on the blade. When suddenly there is a roar from space. It was greater than the roar of the "oles” that would greet the final triumph. All of the eyes look up. And when they looked down - - He missed the kill. - [Scoof] Of course! Suddenly there is a tremendous - [ imitates Loud Noise] The crowd scatter The bull is scared,jump over the barrera, nearly into the lap of His Excellency. Then the bull escaped». and wrecked the market. They found what was left of Y-13 tail section later on in the day. Y-13 How soon can we get a salvage crew down there? I'm afraid it's not quite as simple as that. There are formalities and compensations. Si, Señores. Here is a list, Señor capitan, but, uh, it's not complete. 20,000 pesos! Must have been the bull of the century. Señor capitan, it was a bull... worthy of Manolete himself. Señor Consul, I hope you will cooperate by allowing us to salvage the tail section. - I will use my personal influence. - Thank you. And the United States government will see about adequate compensation. Please impress upon His Excellency that both our countries will benefit... from permission to send a salvage crew onto the crash site... at the earliest possible moment. Of course, Señor capitan, Well, uh, buenos dias, Señores, Buenos dias. Buenos 072?; Oh, and, uh, capitan I hope the next time you lose a missile... you shoot it in some other direction. Boy! We fire a dozen missiles every week. Because something goes wrong once in a while, this kind of thing has to happen. Now, look, Chuck. Wilson's just called. Things are getting pretty serious. There have been three more killings. - Three? - Yeah. - Did he give any details? - Mm-hmm. A truck driver at a roadside diner just outside Los Alamos... and an elderly couple out by Green Valley. Green Valley? Why, that's - How is it traveling those distances in such a short space of time? It can drive. Wilson found a truck with a steering column and foot controls bent so far out of shape... it can't be driven another yard. Ah. I'm beginning to get a picture. We know it has great strength... it's clumsy, smashes everything it touches... and it has mechanical knowledge. What makes you think this has anything to do with Y-13? - I'd like to have you look at something in the lab. - [intercom Buzzes] Excuse me. - Captain Richards. - Commander Larsen, sir. The 5-21 rocket motor is ready on test bed number two. - We fire in 30 minutes. - Hold it. - How long you gonna need me? - I'll make it as fast as I can. Delay your test by one hour. Fire at 1730. But, sir, we're all set! Look, it's about time you boys realized there's more than one baby in this nursery. Delay your test till 1730. I can give you 30 minutes. Let's go. Assuming that there is life in outer space... it would have to create a protective coating... in order to survive those destructive elements up there. You mean, like the primeval creatures that crawled out of the sea... and grew skin to protect themselves against the sun? Yes. Y-13 has penetrated a new world. So this coating was formed on Y-13... to protect it from those destructive forces in space. [Chuckles] It's an interesting theory, but I don't - But suppose the same thing happened in the cockpit. Let me show you something. This. If you notice, this is flexible and... harmless to touch. Let me demonstrate on this piece of sponge rubber here. I'll wrap this around my hand. Now watch this. Holy cow! If this were a human throat, that's how it could be slashed. Look closely into these gashes. Meteorite dust. The same as in the wounds of all the victims - meteorite dust. So, there's only one interpretation I can put on all this. This... monster... kills... but only because, for some reason or other, it needs this blood. No one has seen it and lived. What are you getting at, Chuck? I'm afraid this monster is Dan. - Say, that guy's off course. - Yeah, he's loaded, okay. - [ Engine Starts] - Here we go. [Siren Wailing] Hold on. I'm gonna take him! Okay. I'll handle it. [Policeman Screams] [Gun Hammer Clicking] Dan's metabolism must have changed. But what form has it taken? Without knowing the kind of cosmic rays to which Dan was subjected... and their effect on the physical basis of life... I couldn't say. Perhaps it caused a blood change. Boy! It's incredible to think of your brother as a blood-drinking m - Tia, would you get Dan's metabolism charts and cardiograms? We're gonna need your help. Yes, l-l-l have them all here. Suppose when the canopy burst... his blood absorbed a high content of nitrogen. Then he would die. The human body cannot survive a rarified atmosphere... without the protection of space suits and pressurized cabins. But you're forgetting about that protective coating on 7-73, - And if it formed quickly enough on Dan - - Yes, it might have kept him alive. And if, instead of death, a new metabolism was created... which starved his body and his brain of blood... what then? We know very little. Only that by some mysterious means the cells controlling growth and reproduction... are changed by exposure to some cosmic rays. Beyond that, I could only guess. Yes, I'm only guessing too, Doctor. But I think Dan would be more at home in space... than on Earth. What has been going on hasn't been wanton killing... but only his need to replace this blood that has been changed. He would need some proper transfusions. It would be useless to drink it. Yes, unless he was obeying some animalistic instinct. [Siren Wailing] Your hunch was right, Commander. - Look at this. - [Richards ] It's Dan's space helmet - Where'd you find it? - [ Wilson] Not too far from here, In a car with his latest victim,. And now we know what he looks like - a great big, lumbering, deformed monster. It seems you can't kill him. The bullets bounce off. It's the coating. It's a perfect protection, like armor plate. I've assigned a platoon of marines to help Wilson. Look, I -I know he's got to be stopped, but... remember, he's still Lieutenant Prescott, and - and if he can drive a car, he still retains some intelligence,. He's not all monster. [Groaning, Wheezing] Well, what do you suggest? We just let him roam the state, killing at random? No, Chief, that's not what I meant! Well, look, we've got the works on him. Next time we fight him, we'll try tear gas first. lf that doesn't work, let the marines blast him. Stands to reason, Chuck. If we can't stop him, we got to destroy him. I know, I know. In the meantime, I got to talk to Washington. Doctor, can you take me to your office? I wanna get a long-distance conference line open. Of course, Captain. Come with me. I'd like you along, Chief. Chuck, why did this have to happen? Tia, we're conquering a new world. The dangers have to be faced. Someone has to start. - But why Dan? - Who could stop him? I couldn't, even though I tried. You couldn't either. No, I couldn't. No, though you were right about one thing. It was a piece of machinery that I wanted in the cockpit of 7-73, not Dan. It is hard to remember sometime that people matter more than machines. It is- [Screams] [Growling, Wheezing] - Well, he can't breathe! - [Wheezing Continues] In there! [Crashing] Stop firing! Leave him alone! Get out of here and warn the others to stay away from him! We've got to get to von Essen, tell him to open up a high-altitude chamber. Come on. - Where's your nearest P.A. system? - Reception hall. You'd better get to von Essen. I'll stick with Dan. Go on. [Continues Wheezing] [Grunting] [Screams] Dan! Dan, listen to me! It's Chuck! Listen, I tried to - Attention, everyone! [ Prescott On RA. System] Do not leave your offices! Don't go into the corridor! Your life is in danger if you go into the corridor! [ Prescott On RA. System] Dr. von Essen, he's going the wrong way, Try and direct him on the RA. system. I 'II follow him,. Captain, why don't you let me call my men and blast him? Forget it. I'll take full responsibility. Dan, listen to me! [On P.A. System] You are in the wrong corridor. Remember the building. From the reception hall you should turn right. Do not go straight on. Turn right! Dan, you have come a long way to find me.» and I am very near, If you are following my directions correctly.». you will be approaching a staircase». leading to the high-altitude chamber... where I am waiting for you. Remember, you must turn left onto the staircase. ll' you are on the staircase». you are almost there. Dan, try ham' to remember The chamber is at the end of the corridor"... leading straight from the bottom of the staircase, Take your time, Dan, I'm here in the high-altitude chamber». waiting to help you. Come straight into the chamber. He's coming this way. Captain, open the door to the chamber. - Larsen? - Yes, Doctor? Take Mr. Wilson over to the atmosphere controls. Get as many recorders in operation as you can. [ Prescott] Look out, skipper! [ Roaring, Grunting] [Continues Wheezing] With those hands he'll never be able to connect the inside controls. - I'm going in. - Chuck, you can't! - I've got to. - Chuck! - Dr. von Essen, can you hear me? - Yes, Chuck. Start altering atmosphere immediately. - Take it up as high and as fast as you can. - All right, Chuck. Proceed, Larsen. Open inlet valve. Allow for rise to 30, 000 fleet in 60 seconds, [ Turbines Whining] It's being done, Chuck. Dan. Dan, it's Chuck. Your brother. Don't you know me? Chuck. We want to - [Crash] We want to help you. We want to help you, Dan. Dan. Dan, don't you know me? Chuck! It's Chuck! - Don't you know me? - [Wheezes] Ch - Ch-Chuck? [ Dan Continues Wheezing] Dan, we're trying to help you. Sit down in the pilot's seat. Sit down! That's right, Back up, Easy. Sit down in the pilot's seat. [Gasping] Back up. Back up down at - That's right. Dr. von Essen, get me some oxygen, quick. All right, Chuck. [Hissing] - Dan. - [ Dan Groans] Listen. Dr. von Essen is here. He wants to help you. Dan, I'm here at the window. - Dr. von Essen. - [ Dan] Doctor? I've been searching for you. Everything seems strange and dark. I c-couldn't find you! Tell me about it, Dan. If I know what's happened, I can help you. [Groaning] Under this stuff... I feel like I'm suffering from some terrible disease... like I've got no blood in my veins,. But the rarified atmosphere we are giving you, it helps? Like clean, fresh air. 1 can breathe and think again,. We're up to 30,000 feet. Can Chuck take any more? Be still, Chuck. Don't exert yourself. Take it very steadily up to 38,000 feet, but no more. Go on, Dan. There's not much to tell. I have no memory. Only an instinct to stay alive... until I found you. I've been groping my way,» through a maze of fear and doubt. We're steady at 38,000. Hold it there. Dan, to find out what's wrong with you... I must make metabolism and blood pressure tests. [ Dan] All right, Doctor. Dan, can you tell us what happened up there in space? [Dan Gasps] It was like running into the tail end of a hurricane... only it was a stream of meteorite dust we hit. [ Dan Shudders] At first it was like 50,000 machine guns». all hammering at once, First the canopy... and then my- my visor melted. 1 thought my blood was starting to boil, Then this coating started to form - fast, cooling and protective,. But it was too late, The last thing I remember was... pressing the button of the nose ejector. Then I -I thought l died. How high did you go, Dan? About 250 miles. Maybe 300. I don't know, Chuck, did you hear that? Yeah, Dan. I'm listening. You thought 1 was kidding»... when I said I'd bring back all the dope you wanted, Well, I've got it all. With a covering of this stuff... Y-14 will be able to go through that meteorite dust... straight up- [Wheezing, Gasping] I -It will be able to». go on - forever Rest, Dan. Rest. [Gasping, Panting] He can't breathe. Take it higher. Chuck, I-it's no good. [ Dan] I'm finished, We shall take him higher. But if we do, we'll kill Chuck. [Groaning] - Tia. - Yes, Dan? I-I'm sorry things had to happen this way, But, you see, I - I just... had to be... the first man... into space. Neutralize atmosphere! [ Turbines Whining] [ Dr. von Essen] Right, Captain, Open the door. [ Turbines Winding Down] No, Tia. - Take care of Dan, will you? - Sure, sure. [ Dr. von Essen] There's nothing we can do. You know, Doctor... this is the part of my job I dread. Y-13 cost Dan his life. And we go ahead with Y-14 soon. I wonder if we've learned enough. The conquest of new worlds always makes demands on human life. And there will always be men who will accept the risks.
