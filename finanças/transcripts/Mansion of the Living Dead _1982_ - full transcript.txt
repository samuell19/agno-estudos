MANSION OF THE LIVING DEAD - We're here, girls. - Wonderful! - This is great! - Come on, grab your bags. - Here. - My suitcase. Wake up! - It's so heavy. - This place is beautiful. - Look, look! - Oh, my God! What did I tell you, huh? This is a real tropical paradise. Exotic flora and fauna. Especially the first-class masculine fauna! And this colonial style! - You sound like a travel agent. - It's wonderful, isn't it? Hey, girls. We need to find the front desk. I think it's over there. Come on. - Yeah, let's go. - Let's go! Wow, this place looks deserted. Go figure! Everyone's probably at the beach. - Are you sure it's this way? - Of course. You didn't see the main entrance and the big square sign, huh? I was looking at the road. I was driving. She takes everything so seriously! That's natural. She just got her license a month ago. Go to hell! - You're liable to kill yourself here. - Careful, don't fall. - Which way? - Straight ahead. This is so complicated. Look, here's the front desk Didn't I tell you? - It's so stylish! - But nobody's here. - They're all probably at the beach. - Of course! - Let's call the receptionist. Hello? - Let's go see the garden. - Hello? - Let's go. Hello? Hey, there's no one here either. - They're all probably at the beach. - That's gotta be it. Hey, Mabel! Lea! Come here! We're coming. Come on. Look how pretty it is. - It's so pretty. - You guys are gonna love this. - Look at our pool. - It's great! Awesome! - How am I going to pick up guys here? - We'll all try our best. Oh, yeah. Looks like the place is empty. Yeah. I'm sure they're all at the beach. - Hey, ladies. - Look. Someone is here after all. How did you get in? Can I help you, ladies? - This one is mine. - Forget it. - Since there was nobody here- - I've always been here. - He doesn't look that old. - I don't kid around with strangers. Perhaps you would like some rooms? Yes! Did you make a reservation? Of course. Through a German travel agency. - From Munich. - We reserved two rooms. - Studios. - You wish to see them? - Yes. - Of course. Here's one key. And here's the other. - 609 and 3. - And where are they? One is there. And the other is across the garden. Can't we be together? I'm sorry. All the others are taken. Really? - And where is everyone? - Like I said, at the beach. - Follow me, please. - With pleasure! Same< here! Where's- Give me your key. Please. This one is that way. - Give me the other one. - This sucks. And this one's across from the park I'll see you later, ladies. And he leaves us in the lurch. How do we split up? - I have an idea. Let's toss a coin. - All right! Let me see if I have any change. - Let's see. - Here. - Who wants to go first? - Me. Wait. - Let's see. - Come on. - Seven. - Six. - Nine. - Five! Let's I'm out. - Who's going to call it? - You. - Me? - Yes. - Come on, call it. - Well, eight. - Four. - Five. I won! We're roommates. - Wonderful! - Great. We're going to have a blast. - Come on. Let's go, girls. - Let's go. - How on earth could the hotel be full? - They're all at the beach. - How else can I say it? - You're starting to get annoying, Katy. This is the last stunt she pulls on me. Candy's always meddling in everything. She thinks she's really smart and then she gets taken for a ride. - To be so far apart in a foreign hotel. - Look, I'd rather be separated. You're right, Katy. We'll be more independent. I hope we can pick up some guys and enjoy ourselves. That's right! The hotel's full of tourists. Let's see if they turn up. They have to be somewhere. - On the beach. - Here's our room. You think it's this way? He said it was across the garden. Yeah, I know. But how can we trust that weirdo? Thank God. - It's beautiful. - Amazing. Alone at last. I was afraid... I'd be stuck with one of those prudes. Hey, you don't think that they- No way! They're a pair of sanctimonious nuns. This is beautiful! We're alone at last, my love. I was afraid you'd end up with one of those pious bitches. Gotta pee! Hey, you think those two hooked up? Don't you think? No. They're totally old-fashioned. They'd be scandalized. We're going to have a blast. We're totally set. If we meet a man, we'll do him and that's that. And if we don't meet one, you and I... are gonna have a great time. We're gonna have a lot of fun. We've got that advantage. If we pick up a guy, we'll screw him. If we don't pick up any guys, we'll have a ball all by ourselves. And those two idiots bored out of their minds. Come here. I don't have a dress for dinner. We'll go naked. Oh, yeah! I'll wear- I don't have an iron. - Let's go borrow one from those prudes. - All right. Candy! Lea! Where are you? - What do those two want? - No idea. I'm coming! I'm coming! How do you get to your apartment? Through the other side. Next to the pool! This is crazy! - Look at that ass! - You're silly! Leave me alone! - They're on their way. - I don't care. - Hi. - Hi. Sorry to bother you. No, no. Come in. It's no bother. We came to ask if we can borrow your iron. The iron? Oh. Go get it. How's your apartment? - It sucks. - This one's much better. Tough luck! So they were all at the beach, huh? What a funeral! I've never seen a more deserted place in my life. It's got its points. We'll be able to relax much better and feel more rested. - Hello! - Hello! There they are. - This is so beautiful. - Yeah, it's really lively. - Where is everyone? - I don't know. Everyone probably went on a day trip, I guess. You know what? I'm going to sunbathe naked. There you go! Come on, girls! Let's all sunbathe naked! - Come on, Katy. You too. Let's go! - Well, of course! Come on! - No, I've got ugly boobs! - Come here! - You're really hot. - Don't be so disgusting! You know what? This place is weird. Oh, go to hell! Don't start with your ghost stories. You're so dumb. This is awesome. So peaceful- That was so scary. Don't you realize? They tried to kill us! They tried to murder us. - Don't you realize? - Yes. But who? Who would want to murder four hotties like us? Well, I don't know, but someone tried to murder us. I know. It was a jealous woman who found her husband spying on us. - But the hotel is empty. - That's because they're on their yachts. I think we need to leave right now. Are you crazy? Saving up all year for this, and we leave now? - I'm staying. - It could have been an accident. Or a little kid playing cops and robbers. Stay here. Beautiful! - What are you doing here? - Who, me? - What do you think? - Spying on us? Me? I was here just like I could've been anywhere else. You don't know me. I'm the hotel gardener. I'm here, I'm there- I tend to my plants, I tend to my flowers. - Stop jabbering. - I can't spy on you. Can't you hear the wind? Yes. 80 what? I don't like it at all. It's really sinister. We're two real heroines. - Hey. - What? - You don't mind sleeping alone? - No. It bothers me. A lot! I love having a hot body next to me. Little tits like these. And a little bush like this one. You know, I've always been a tree-hugger. - You're so silly! - Silly? You wait and see. It's delicious, my love. Are you serious? This vacation is gonna be unbelievable! - You're leaving? - I'm going out for a walk. Did you pick up some guy? No. I'm going to take some pictures in a scenic spot nearby. - The gardener told me about it. - Really? I swear. All right. Don't take too long. See you later. Sweet dreams. What are you doing here? Why did you come in? What do you want? Don't be afraid. It's me. The hotel manager. Carlos Savonarola. What are you doing out here so late? Are you sleepwalking, or do you suffer from insomnia? Anything can happen to you here. Aren't you ashamed of yourself, walking around the hotel like that, naked? - Does it bother you? - Have you thought about the other guests? I don't care about the other guests. Does it bother you? No, it doesn't. But what are you looking for? - Looking for? - Yes. Why are you out so late? Well, I thought I heard a woman moaning. Impossible. The hotel is completely silent. I assure you I heard a woman. I heard her moaning. I couldn't sleep. That's absurd. Be reasonable and go to bed. Don't you feel like sleeping? Yes. But not when I'm alone. - You've got your roommate. - Don't be an idiot. - Don't you understand me? - I believe I do. May I? Make yourself at home. My gosh! It's 4:00. But where are you going? I've got to feed a sick woman. Can I see you tomorrow? Yes, of course. Whenever you want. - Yes. It's better that way. - But where? I'll wait for you in my car, in the parking lot. When? At 10:00. Bye! I'm worried about Lea. She said she was going out to take some pictures and she'd be right back. She probably met someone. - Well, whenever I meet someone, I call - I totally space out. You lose your mind every time you get near a man. And sometimes when I don't! I'm going to find that waiter. Waiter! He's probably asleep. Waiter! Where is he? Let's check in there. Hey, you! Don't hide! Hey! - Hi. Good morning. - Oh, hi. How are you? You look great this morning. Well, us good-looking babes would love to have some coffee. - Yes, some breakfast. - Coffee? Where do you think you are? - You think this is New York or something? - Are you kidding? This is a whatchamacallit- a democracy. And in a democracy no one drinks coffee We all drink whiskey! - We just want to have some breakfast. - This guy's a total fruitcake. - You don't have any coffee? - Of course not! You know what I do personally when I want coffee? - I've got foresight and I'm a modern man. - Stop jabbering. - I make it myself. No more slavery. - Don't be mean. We're just three poor starving little girls. - And coffee will end your hunger? - And some bread rolls. - Tell him to go fuck himself. - Unbelievable. Go fuck yourself! What we Spaniards have to put up with! Having to deal with broads like these. - You heard it. - Yeah. Nope. No breakfast for us. It's not the end of the world. At the travel agency in Munich they said this was almost like heaven on earth. - And look! - Of course it is. Or do you think they serve coffee in heaven? They also don't throw knives at your head. You know what we need to do? Let's go to the grocery store and we'll cook up something ourselves, huh? I'm dying for some barbecue. Or a hamburger with tomato. Well, you'll have to excuse me. You're leaving? Where are you going? I've got a date with a guy. Hey, wait! Don't bail out on us too! Wait, please. At last. - What are you doing hiding there? - Let's see if you can guess. It's a gift. - Food. - All you think about is eating. - Another pair of stockings. - No. A chamber pot. You're more like an animal every day. You eat, you shit. - Don't you know what day it is today? - No. It's the Day of the Dead. Your birthday. Here. I brought you a little something. Oh, Carlo. They're beautiful. You're turning into a double-crossing bitch. The other day you reached for the tray with your foot and ate the bread. And now the flowers too! You don't love me. You've fallen for one of those whores! Don't start with your jealousy again. Didn't I prove that they don't interest me by throwing the knife at them? What more do you want? You didn't even cut them. I want you. You should have realized that a long time ago. I gave you the best room in the hotel. I look after you every day. You make me suffer a lot. In pain... Just as in love, there are no bounds. Slut. Tramp. Exhibitionist. I'll leave you that way. With a burning desire. Trembling, like a cat in heat. You disgust me. Please, don't go. You can't leave me this way! Your hands are free, aren't they? Why did you bring me here? Hey, what's wrong with you? Are you afraid of me? I don't feel well. Wait for me here. Carlo? Where did you go? Is anyone here? Anybody here? Come closer. Don't be afraid. Who are you? What do you want? Let go of me. Silence. - Another lost sheep? - Let go! - Let go of me! - Silence, young woman. Our brother Savonarola brought us a new sinner. Kneel down. Obey, slut. Kneel down before me. Kneel down! No! Let go of me! You are kneeling before the Holy Court of the Cathar... that of the saintly men with a white habit and a black soul. Let go of me! Zarzuelo, one of our most beloved brothers... brought you here to be tried for your many sins. She's a whore, Father. As the presiding judge of this court, I propose she be put to death... while she enjoys carnal sin... so that her desirable body may join the ranks of Satan's sewers! - Aye! - Aye! The sentence shall be carried out immediately with the proper ritual. - Take her away! - No! Damn you and bless you. Bless you and damn you. May your sins... never be forgiven. - Enjoy... - Please! The mortal sin. Sanctus Luciferibus avernum Protect these servants so that they may not draw any pleasure... while carrying out this sinner's sentence. May our sins of kindness be forgiven... so that we may follow your path of perversion... offering you new victims... with which to satisfy your infinite lust. Have mercy on us. Father of the underworld... have mercy on us. Sinner. Whore. Your body quivers with desire. But the sentence must be carried out. Amen. Oh, Father, forgive me... for having felt pleasure. Please! Receive her soul... Prince of Darkness. Receive her soul... Prince of Darkness. Our Father, who art in hell... your black-souled sons... continue to carry out your will... and bring you this new offering... as a token of their total submission... to you and your accursed Decalogue... which came into our hands thanks to our founder's ploys. Beautiful little flower With golden petals With little bird teeth - What are you doing here? - What? I'm singing to the flowers. Don't you know you need to sing to flowers to make them bloom? Just like with you. You are a flower and I need to sing to you... so that you may look as beautiful as possible. Don't you want me to sing to you? - No. - Why? Poppy. Beautiful poppy. Leave me alone. - No. - Don't go away. You won't look beautiful, you'll age quickly and you'll rot. And your skin will be as wrinkled as a prune! Katy? Open up! What's wrong? What's wrong with you? Lea still isn't back. Neither is Mabel. - Can I sleep here? - Yes, of course. It's just that I'm so worried, and I don't like being alone. - Come on in. - Thanks. You know what we should do if they don't show up? Of course. Sleep. That's impossible for me. I can't sleep if I don't make love. And what have you been doing the last couple of days? Lea and I have managed. And Mabel thought you two were a couple of prudes. - I'm a wild animal! - Bite me, you wild animal. Clothes always get in the way. A little hair! Well, make a wish and blow. My God. Who are you? What are you doing here? Please! The tray. Pass it to me. Please! Please! Please! Yes. Thanks. I can't stand it any more. I haven't eaten in four days. He brings me a new tray every day. But I can't reach it! It's the worst torture of all. “He?" Who is he? Who else? My husband. The receptionist. He's a sadist. Don't trust him. “Him?“ Who is he? But there's no one else. - Who else? Carlo, that bastard. - Carlo? I came here on vacation a long time ago. He's very attractive, of course. We became lovers. He locked me in here. That's horrible. And you haven't asked for help? You didn't shout to draw the attention of the other guests or the hotel manager? He's also the hotel manager. He put- He put this collar on me as a joke. To turn him on, he said. After we made love, he left it on me. - For a long time? - He never took it off again. I don't understand you. What that man is doing is crazy. What about the other guests? Haven't you asked them to help you? This hotel doesn't have any guests. It doesn't even have a manager. Or an owner. Carlo is the only one here. Just him. That bastard. And that other asshole. That despicable Marlene His servant. But Carlo is the evil one. That's impossible. He seems like such a polite man. - But what about the hotel? - It's been closed for years. We came here through a travel agency. We live in a town near Munich. They recommended this place. Those bastards. They really take advantage of women. We work at a topless joint. It's in right now. - We're waitresses showing off our boobs. - You poor things. We took a couple of days vacation. It's our first vacation in many years. They showed us some pictures of the hotel. It was so cheap. It was like a dream. Do you think they made an error sending us here? Not at all. It's a racket. They do it intentionally. And they pretend to be pious people. Carlo claims to have been a deacon. But I don't believe him for a second. He's a jealous bastard. A torturer. He's killing me slowly. He only feeds me once a week. But what about the police? Haven't you called them? They never make it out here? They came once. Carlos told me about it. This hotel closed- It closed after the first killings. Some women tourists turned up dead. Their bodies mutilated! They cut them into little pieces after murdering them. This place is cursed. Up until about two centuries ago... this was the inquisition's headquarters on the islands. They say that the tortured spirits of those men... are the only inhabitants of this place. When the wind is blowing... at night, you can hear... the old abbey's bells... and the funeral chants. That's horrible. How could they allow something like this? They're all selfish. Starting with that damn Carlo and his supposed holiness. He says I'm dissolute. A lustful slut. When he can't stand it any more... he takes me violently. It's the only time I'm in a state of total bliss. That and when he takes me outside to relieve myself. He takes me out with the chain, to the field. Sometimes I go to the bathroom like dogs do. He laughs a lot. And he calls me his little bitch. But he locks me up again in no time. I love him and I hate him. Go away, dear. Maybe he's waiting for me to die so that you can take my place, chained here. You would like that, right? Out! Get out of here! Beat it, whore. Go! Go! Hey, listen. Wait. Before you go... pass me my lipstick and my compact. He doesn't like it when I wear makeup. Thanks. Is anyone here? Hey, my friend is dead in the pool. In the pool you say? Can't you see nobody's in the pool? It's in the bungalow pool. The bungalow pool? Good Lord! I thought I had heard it all These foreigners are nuts. Bungalows with a pool. My God! Katy, it's horrible. Lea is dead in the pool. Come with me. - Please. - Our friend is dead in the pool. This is the excursions desk. Please go to the front desk. Receptionist? Is anyone here? Receptionist? - What can I do for you? - Please help us. It's horrible. it's our friend Lea. She's dead right next to the bungalows. In the pool. - In the pool? - Yes. I walked by the pool and didn't see a body. - The bungalow pool? - Let's go take a look. All right, ladies. As I imagined, you were mistaken. - There's no dead body here. - But I saw her. Candy. Are you sure it wasn't a figment of your imagination? She was here. I'm sure! You'll have to excuse me, but I'm very busy with the day trips today. She was here minutes ago. Well, you can see for yourself. Maybe it was a dream. Sometimes we confuse dreams with reality. Why are you shouting? Are you afraid of me? Oh, it's you. I was asleep and this murmuring woke me up. I pray every night with a Latin Bible. Then it's true. You used to be a monk. You've been talking to the crazy one. - She's not crazy. - Raving mad. You have her locked up. Why? If I didn't take care of her, she'd be committed. She's incurable. Isn't she doing better? Schizophrenia. I don't want to talk about it. Thanks for telling me. The first time I've confessed my misfortune. You're a... a strange man. Absurd. Like from another world. From another time. That's true. I am from another time. But you're real. You're almost too strange to be real. Too wonderful to be real. Imaginary. Fictional. A ghost. But what I see before me is a real person. If I wasn't real, could you love me? No. Only if I belonged to your world. Maybe you do. I recognized your soul, your body, when I first saw you. You're Irina, returning from the past to liberate me from my curse. You must do it today. Today? Come with me to the place where Irina cursed our community... before burning at the stake. You are Princess Irina... who's come back to earth.-. To liberate me with her love. This is so strange. I feel like I've been here before. You have been here before. I'm sure of it. Come. - Will you save me? - Yes. From this point on, it will be too late. You can still go back to the hotel. Then you're going to help me? Yes, I will. The past begins anew. Wait for me here. Next to the place where Irina cursed us while burning at the stake. Turning us into lost souls in Satan's service. Close your eyes, my love. Where are you? Come closer, sister. Come, don't be afraid. I know it's you. And that that is your real face. Yes. And my real... personality. A face rotten by many centuries. Come. Kneel down. My child... your sins will be forgiven. I haven't done anything! You are the sacrificial lamb of this community... and you must and will be punished. Please! No! You will die in a terrible manner. And in mortal sin! Please. What do you want, my son? Don't kill her. How dare you ask me that? I love her. Accept her as a servant. Mercy! I will save you. I swear it. Your baptism must commence. Take her away. She will receive the mark of the accursed semen... that will turn her into one of our own. Lord of Darkness. Lord, receive your servant with hate. Lord, receive your new sister. I take you as my wife. As my wife! Oh, it's you, Candy. You scared me. What's wrong? Where were you? What's wrong with you? You're very pale. Get off me! I've got a delicious little stew for you. It's a little bland. Hold on. A little insecticide. There. And the best rat poison. - Yes. Now it'll taste much better. I don't understand you. Now you don't want to eat? I cooked it myself. With my own hands. For you. You want to kill me. Get rid of me. It's not that. You know how many sacrifices I've made for you? I've taken care of you as if you were my wife, my daughter. It's not that. But I'll admit that I'm in love. It would be best for the community... if the dirty lust I feel for you were to disappear. No, please. Tell me it's not true. Don't leave me. No. Along... long time ago... we executed a foreign woman. Irina Desound. We impaled her. We burned her at the stake and she cursed us. We would never attain eternal rest... until we felt love. Real... pure and holy love. Until then... we were to be lost souls. Now that witch has returned. I've fallen in love with her. I recognized her as soon as I saw her. It's without doubt my last chance. And I feel that I love her I love her like a kid. Like a saint. Like a superior being. Only your existence tarnishes that feeling! It prevents me from being liberated! Bye, Olivia. Enjoy your meal. You have been received into our midst... accursed sister of the community. Our brother Savonarola... sees in you the root of all our ills... and the possible liberating vehicle... that will grant us eternal rest. If that is true, you have... our own death in your hands. Father... allow me... to fulfill our destiny. If the ritual kiss brings love to your lips... this convent will be set free. Thank you. And may your old servants... Lord of Good... return to your bosom... and leave the monstrous embrace... that separated us from you. May the curse forever end... and may the Lord of Heaven... have mercy on you too, my child. Go, then, and fulfill your destiny. Before the accursed cross... I offer you my soul! Now. You are... Carlo. Just Carlo. THE END
