José Martí: The Eye of the Canary Certainty, reason, dignity, bees humiliation. So you want to help your fellow man... How nice. Here he is. The Great Benefactor! Who was the beneficiary? Or was it more than one? Give me your hand. Show it. Show it! Fine. If the cheat doesn't turn up, his punishment will be double. I was here first. I'm not moving. Ma'am, please just move your carriage. Nothing's in its way. I don't have to give way. And tell that man he's very stubborn. And you, exert your authority. That's my house, and neither the road roadworks nor that man have the right to block my way Sorry, ma'am, but my area is San Felipe. Their office is around the corner and down the way. -Palanqueta went for them! -Run, Palanqueta! "Stubborn old man!" Now that we're alone, You can tell me who you were helping. No one will know. Nobody. You're afraid. You won't talk because you're afraid. On your knees, On your knees! José Julian Martí, you're a chicken. Gentlemen, this is over... Black Mouth! Black Mouth is coming! Let me go! Let me go! I was here first. I'm not moving. This lady thinks she owns the place. The roadworks annoy her and she's bawling out those poor men. I've been here for 40 minutes. First a city policeman, then a local policeman came But they did nothing I've got a right to get past. Tell that man to let me past Let's see, let's see. With all due respect, from what I've heard, he was here first so he should go first so please move your carriage back. Give way? I'm to give way? -Yes, ma'am -You're making a mistake with me! Sebastian, get that horse moving! I'll teach you what your duty is! I said to move back. Have you got that? When I say back, I mean it! But...good gracious! Stop that man! Stop him! The horse! Don't hit it! Stop that man! Back! Back! Move on! Move on, I say! Let's get this straight, ma'am... Nobody needs to tell me what my duty is when it comes to justice. You got me wrong. It's all over! Everybody get to work! Being a policeman is not for you, Mariano. you're not cut out for it. Here, a little more. Why not work as a tailor again? You'd be at home more. Chata and Anita are big now. They can help and I can sew. How was Pepe when he came back from school? Dirty, without his books, very withdrawn. You have to take him to school tomorrow. They forced the cabinet open. Spelling and handwriting tests are kept here, they opened it yesterday afternoon. Because I closed it at four, as I do every day. And it so happens your son ran away from school yesterday. Isn't that a coincidence? Why did you do it? Is this what I taught you? He hasn't spoken since yesterday. He's a hardworking boy. but he has to learn what his duties are. I'm sorry, Don Mariano, but until we find the culprit, your son cannot attend school. -Teacher... -What is it, Fermín? I opened the cabinet. No, I did it I didn't open it either, but they're not expelling me. My father's very big in the church. That's why they never tell him anything. I don't want you to get expelled. Who opened the cabinet then? The twins. Everyone knows it. They couldn't finish copying because you were caught, so they broke the cabinet and cheated on the exam. Everyone says she thinks she owns the place... Everyone is tired of her... Her name is Doña Adelaida de Villalonga. She doesn't talk, she barks like her dog. The Chief of Police wants to see me tomorrow. He's another one. Mariano,stop. You're angry because you want to be, That's not true, Leonor! Besides, I did what I had to do. If they want a fight, they've got one. You'll do it again on Thursday, stupid. -What? -The teacher found me out. Don't turn into a snitch, you pansy. You're our slave and you have to do it. Pret! Allez! Bien! Bien. I'm younger than you, but I'll give you some advice Don't be so uncouth. Some lady wants your head. I only dealt out justice. Justice isn't a personal thing for you or for me. You seem to know her well Justice or the lady? The former, to be honest, I just don't know. But the lady I do. She was here all morning. And I'll see her tonight at the dance in the Palace. Doña Adelaida is a good friend of the Captain General. 12 years, 7 months and 22 days serving His Majesty! What good did it do me? What good? That snobby Adelaida and the Captain General. And our brave chief too. But it didn't crush my spirit. I didn't bow my head. I'll never let them humiliate me. It's not fair! It isn't! What is fair, Mariano? To be like you are now? Tired, sick, unemployed? Is that fair? What I did was fair, Leonor! I wasn't going to let a wretched old man be abused. Do me a favor. Do me a favor. Give me a cigar. It'll relax me ...or kill me. Oh, Mariano, good heavens! We're the wretched and we'll starve to death. And to top it off I'm 7 months gone. I'll find something, Leonor. And Pepe is old enough to start working. Pepe, why the long face? What's the matter with you? What is it, my boy? You're cold... and wet. You're not going to school today. Don't worry. I'll treat that pallor with Vuchu extract and chicken fat. -What do we do with this? -Sell it to Emiliana -What Emiliana? -Zambrano's sister. If I may...Master Femin is here to see Master Pepe Everyone's asking why you are not at school. You have to go, Pepe. Even if you're dying. You and I promised to look out for each other. I'll help you tell the twins the answers. Do it for me. They said I'd be the first one thrown into the ditch. Open your mouth wide. Good! Now your eyes. Open them. Leonor, I'm leaving. I'll be back to get you. Chata! I'll leave him in your hands, doctor. -Chata! -Coming! Come on, I said! Sorry, doctor, all I can offer you is a little horchata. How is he? Carry on with the chicken fat, and don't worry. What Pepe needs is a good "school bath." Be careful.... don't let them out. Fractions... ...are the basis of Arithmetic. Those of you who do not master them today, will fail the test. José Julian will sit next to me. Just in case. I want total silence, alright? Let's begin. Perez Villalba, to the blackboard. Write. Seven times four, minus eight. divided by five is... is equal to... begin, Perez Villalba. Time's running out, Perez Villalba. Just a second. I'm thinking. -It bit me! It bit me! -What happened? Teacher, they're right there! Calm Down! Calm Down! Two of them! Two spiders! Watch out! Don't go near. Move back. Back! Watch out! Everyone to the back! Back up! I told you to get back! Teacher! Teacher! I've finished. See? These are their caves. My brother taught me how to hunt them. We're the brotherhood of spiders now. What if they bite us? I'll teach you how to hunt them. You pee and they come out. Know what my brother taught me? If you touch your thing softly, It gets bigger and hard. And it gives you a nice tickle. Like this, look. Try it. Come on. Look at this dumb kid! Come in. Chata, get me some cloth. Don't let your father see. Do you want to kill yourself? You were sick yesterday and today you're soaked. You have to be stronger than ever, Pepe. Do you know why? Because your father found a job. A bit far away, but it's a job. He'll be the local judge in Hanabana. He wants you to go there on your next holidays. to help him write the reports... because your writing's better than his. -Bring me brown sugar candy. -A hen with its chicks! -Me too. -Bye, Pepe. Have a nice trip. Master Fermín! Master Fermín! Oh god! Master! Pepe, the twins didn't pass! Their father took them to some barracks in Matanzas! A penny, sir! A penny! Tomas! Master, please, bless us! You see, this isn't like in town. Here they behave like little animals. Hey look! The largest slave consignments have been in these swamps Have you heard of Zulueta, the landowner? In one go he sold... 1200 unbroken black slaves at 26 ounces each Just add it up... That's why all the landholders avoid the ban. Slave traders here are more important than you are. Lard-ass! Look sir. I'll tell you something. I was sent here to put and end to traffic in slaves. I want it to be clear that's what I'm here for. Your predecessor said that too, but reality persuaded him. If you really came for that, count on my help. The canary has a pretty song but prefers to live in a cage. I'll take you to the woods to see the free birds singing A tile lean-to shed, with two rooms one for sleeping.. and the other a pantry. Write every piece of furniture on a new line. A mahogany wardrobe with its lock. A small desk with its lock. A desk drawer with its lock. What is that? - I said "lock ", not "id". -It's Latin. It means "the same." But in Spanish you wrote "lock." In documents you write "idem" not to repeat the words, Father. Well... Then, An American chest with second-hand clothes. A wooden item with... idem clothes Is that right? Wake up, lazybones! the cock is crowing! Come on! Well My scribe doesn't want to do the rounds today. But I need you to go through two reports and a procedure order I left on the table. Understood? I'll be back at four. (faint whistle) (Whistle repeats) (Whistle repeats) The silk-cotton tree is sacred and wise and will take care of you One day I'll fetch you And you'll learn the secrets of the night forest Take this You earned it The fireflies light the night. Now put your head on the earth and listen... You'll hear it... What were you doing with my son, you witch doctor? And you, get in. Inside! I'll tell you! I'll tell you! Master, I'll tell you. You'll tell the walls in jail. I'm taking you there now. -Don't touch me! -Mercy, Master! Don't you dare touch me! Mercy, Master. -I said not to touch me! -Please, Master, I did nothing! I swear I did nothing. Old Tomas did nothing. Stand up and come along! Don't touch me! I told you not to, damn it! Let go of me! Stop it, Tomas. Stand up! Go Inside! Inside I said! Bloody hell! Good boy did nothing! Blame Old Tomas! -Out! -Blame Old Tomas! Get Out! Blame Old Tomas... Good boy did nothing! Blame Old Tomas! Good boy did nothing! Blame Old Tomas! Good boy did nothing! Blame Old Tomas! This is yours. You earned it. Our population is scant But you've won their respect. The peasants told me themselves. And the reports. Especially the reports. The best I've received. Such good handwriting and wording. Where did you study? No, No. My son writes the reports. He's my scribe. Then send him here. His handwriting is like a king's. Our most illustrious neighbors have come to see me about you. The Gamboas, The Aguirres... They're kind of ...anxious You know all the landholders... have deals with slave traders. and it seems that you... Well... I'm just doing my job. I'm not asking for anything else, but work has its limits. Take care of the peasant. I'll take care of the Gamboas, The Aguirres, and the slave traders. When in Rome, do as the Romans do! We'll do what we've always done. No newcomer is changing that. Wait for me in the yard. I have something to tell you. Now you'll gallop... Free, free, free! That bastard was one of the Gamboas. They are the largest slave traders in this area, and in Cuba. They've bought the Lieutenant Governor. and they think they have me too. If you really want to do your job, go to Playa Hermosa right now. But don't say I told you. Master pepe! Master pepe! Master pepe! Move. slave! Walk, slave! Move it! Halt! Stop in the name of the law! Don Mariano, we're doing what we've always done! One of them is missing! This bitch had a pup! A pup ran away! Damn them all! Brown whores! Halt! Stop it, dammit! Stop it right now, damn it all! Stop this! Stop it, dammit all! Arias It is the hour... when they Who love us are accustomed to descend... Through the deep clouds o'er rocky Ararat: But the stars are hidden. I tremble. ...So do I But not with fear... It is already eight, Pepe. What are you still doing here? Ah, you were translating Lord Byron... There are books you shouldn't read too soon Or too late either. Perhaps I discovered the mystery of Lord Byron too late. Tomorrow, I'll help you with the translation. Now go home. It's a little late for us both. Chata, your syrup. Recoil, recoil! Cod liver oil! Go on singing. You'll take some too. Chata and Ana will have it when they finish with me. You won't avoid it. Yesterday you got lucky, but not today. Pepe! Odd, odd, you'll have cod. No, Pepe has to eat first. Pepe stays here. He has to hear me out. Look at your sisters. They've been sitting there since two o'clock. Sewing, helping me. And they went to school today. They're about to go to sleep. You're home at last. So... I'd like to know: What is it that you learn at Mendive's school? As far as I know, you can already add, subtract... your handwriting is good.... This should be enough... for you to start working. Because we all work in this house. But I have to study, Father. Pepe's the top of his class. To take him out now would cut short his studies. It's settled, Leonor. I want no contradictions. On Monday We'll go to Salustiano's store. He needs a helper. Nobody will keep me down. Especially not some corrupt rulers. Oh, Mariano, the corrupt rulers will go on corrupting themselves. and bringing slaves in Cuba. They got you out of Hanabana. Your dignity is worth nothing because we have no education. Pepe is our only hope. We can't make him sacrifice that. Per aspera ad astra. Hard is the road by which we reach the stars. We'll now study the declensions to which populus populi belong, masculine. laurus Lauri.. Allow me, Mr. Rosales. A great man has been assassinated President Lincoln has fallen, victim of the enemies of freedom. and when freedom suffers, all men of good will suffer too. I will personally represent San Pablo school in mourning for a week ...as will all those who feel this pain Long live Spain with honor! Don Fernando Long live Spain with honor! -Good morning, Don Salustiano. -Oh, my! At long last. Do you know what my grandfather used to say? That you cannot tie up dogs with pork sausage. You can see, soldiers come in every day and have to be fed. Taxes are sky-high. Your father brought you at last. There's a lot of work you have to catch up on I didn't notice there had been a loss in the family. I'm sorry. No, sir. It's for Abraham Lincoln, an American patriot. Pay no heed, Salustiano Instead of training them for work, schools now put smoke into their heads. If he stays there, he'll be turned into a disloyal Cuban. I'm sorry, Don Mariano. But for that Lincoln, I'd be disloyal too. Know something, José Julian I have a feeling you and I will get along very well, very well. No more talk: tomorrow you start working with me here. He may be a teacher and all you say, but he's got a mouth on him. Don't close your mind. He's a good man and tries to help us. He doesn't have to come here to play down my authority. telling me what I have to do with my own family Mariano, please. If you don't do it for him, do it for me. -I'd leave with your teacher. -Stop it, Chata. What are you doing there? So I've been thinking... everything you say is right, but with all due respect: study is vocation, work is obligation José Julian is the best student we have in school. I told you, Don Salustiano agrees. Pepe can go on working in the mornings and come to school in the afternoons, half time. and with the same salary. Pepe Have you come for Pepe to go to school? Yes, Don Salustiano I'll tell him. Pepe, your friends are here to go to school. Now a doughnut each. Just one. Come on, Pepe. Take yours. Thank you, Don Salustiano. -Say hello to Mendive -Yes, Don Salustiano. I'm sure Bermudez, the hairdresser, is queer. He's not queer. If he were, my uncle wouldn't work with him. -You jumped like a hairdresser. -Pepe, coward! There's theater fever in Havana. Or rather, heat! An Italian company is coming in November, with Adelina Patti. Carlos, you must talk to your uncle. I can't cope with everything. And the errand boy left for Puerto Principe. Do you like that music? Yes. I could be your errand boy. Conscientiousness is paid with quality. Two and a half ounces. You may be proud: your first salary, boy. -You've worked very well. -Thank you. Salustiano! the bags you ordered are here Coming, coming! Come on, Pepe. One of the bags is for you. -For me? -Of course. For school. Come on! That is also for your good work. Come on! Pepe, take the other bags to the storage room. Yes, Don Salustiano. Don Salustiano, tell your son I'll see him tonight in Escauriza. Less dancing and more study. -Dancing doesn't buy food. -Don't worry, old man. Professors will be there. Take care! You piece of shit! Look what you've done! Apologize. -I am free and Cuban, sir. -Cuban? Kneel and apologize! Spain is the one who should apologize. Who are you? Who the hell do you think you are? Another birdie. The university is full of them. We have to teach them respect for national integrity. -I've known him since he was a child. -A conspirator! Bah! Leave him alone. Long live Spain! Shout "Long live Spain"! Cuba does not have to apologize to Spain. Cuba is Spanish and is honored to be Spanish. They'll have to populate it again to turn it Spanish! Long live Cuba! -Shout "long live Spain." -Stop it. Shout it or I'll cut out your tongue! Stop it, shit! I'm from Galicia, I'm Spanish, and I love Spain balls deep. but in this store there are no birdies and no sparrows and the only integrity we defend here is mine. Shit! -Spain was offended here and... -Put that gun down, Captain. Put it down, I say, dammit! I'm not going to leave things like this. Spain was offended and treason should be punished. This is a nest of thieves and schemers. Remember, Salustiano. You'll pay for this dearly. Salustiano, traitor! Vicente, bring some of the best wine we have in stock. We'll toast to Spain and Cuba. Yes, let's sing and toast. And if her ills do not vanish when she dances... Father, my first salary. Leonor, congratulate your son. My little man... Father I'd like to... if possible... give my sisters some coins. Very well. Chata! Come, girls! Pepe has a surprise for you. Look at Chata... Where'd you get the piggy bank? -Pepe made the promise a long time ago -He's going to buy me a dress. -You don't say! -He won't buy me anything. Well I think Pepe is promising too much for what he earns. How much are you giving each one? Five pennies each is all right, so they learn to save from now on. I want some soursop for a milkshake. All right, Pilar. We'll do all that tomorrow morning before school. And you'll go with me to buy two shirts and some trousers. You're a man now, you can't dress like a hick. Look, some good fruit. For your sister. -Look, Daddy, soursops! How are you, teacher? Let's go, Pepe. She's singing for peace but her people want war. It's Adelina Patti. she's singing tonight -May I stay for the rehearsals? -Yes, and the performance too. But, always hidden in the wings. Oh, my God! I swear I've never had to punish her and I forgot. If something happens to her, I swear to God I'll kill you. BIRTHDAY Forgive me, mother", for leaving you to go to the battlefield. These tears are witness of my terrible anxiety and the storm roaring in my insides..." Sleep, Pepito. If you go on like that... "at six they'll put you in a shroud." At six they baptized me. there's a leak! The furniture is getting wet. I'll find a blanket to cover it Brother... -I'm in love. -But Chata... Stop it. You're not Mother or Father. Write a poem to give to him as if it were mine. Mother is coming! Pepe, you're killing yourself! I'll give you some coffee and milk. You have to eat. -Is Father coming home tomorrow? -I don't know. He doesn't have a day off this month, poor thing. Mother, why not make stew for lunch? We haven't had it for days. Today I'm making crinkled potatoes. And cassava with oil sauce. Father's armchair is being eaten by termites. Oh Love, there are termites all over the house. He who wants to defend his land does not mind blood or obstacles. Tyrannus democratia. What are the essential features of democracy? Please, Ignacio. I believe that for there to be democracy... there must be... freedom. That's why there's no democracy in Cuba. I want to make a paper with "The Lame Devil"for a title. But they won't let me publish it. It isn't in their interest. The idea I will pose is that Cuba lacks freedom of the press, freedom of expression and others... Fermín, it's all right. But we have limits Gentlemen, please, let's not stray from our topic. Fermín, Fermín.... Do you know what a democratic country with freedom of press and expression would be? It's be chaos, Fermín. You don't know what you're saying. As a citizen I have the right to express my ideas. Professor, please. Continue with your Greek class. Democratia means "people's power"in Greek. in Cuba there is anything but people's power. Please, think: how good is freedom without democracy? Cuba may make use of democratic forces. and be represented in the Spanish courts. That's Reformist and it's garbage! -What do you mean, garbage? -Why can't I... Boys, boys, please... Excuse me. Why can I not say what I think? I don't feel represented by this government. It's useless. You? You? Don't mess with me... Please, please... Let's go back to Ancient Greece, alright? Isn't democracy people's power? We're ruled by those who have to rule and will go on ruling. Don't turn this place into a brouhaha. Professor, I actually believe there is democracy in Cuba. That's an opinion. Let me, Fermín. Look, democracy is in Yara. And also in Carlos Manuel de Céspedes forces. which are right now fighting for the liberty of Cubans. Come on, man! Nice! And now what we always have A narrow path takes us to the flourishing woods. and there people disband and the mountain try to climb tamarind branches tangle up in the trunks of every palm and on the hills doves coo on top of a cashew tree and this rocky place for me... ...is the mound of Caisimu! Bravo! Bravo! That's how I like it. Punctual like a Brit on Saturdays. There are two more stanzas. Call Pepe! Go! Pepe! Pepe! Come! But you have no sense of shame, Either good, so-so, or bad, if you don't say with me: long live the cane-producing land! -Long live Cuba! -Long live free Cuba! Come on, man! Hit it, Creole! The play goes on... The guards are coming... -What is happening here? -The play is good. Go see it! This is a day of glory for the Cuban theater. This was only the rehearsal! In two days things will be hot! We'll ask Cuban women to let their hair down. Go straight home now. They say there'll be freedom of press but we'll never have freedom of speech. Go now! Have you forgotten who I am? Where I was born? Answer me! What am I? Spanish. Spanish... And I fathered a Cuban. I won't let a seditious teacher turn you into a dissident. I am a policeman. And I will not lose my job for foolishness like this This is over and done with. Father, this is a play. And I'll publish it in my paper, Free Homeland. In your WHAT? Homeland... This family is your homeland, dammit! It is not Cuba or Spain. Only the blood I gave you! Leonor, from now on he's not going out at night. Is that clear? And I myself will put an end to Mendive's petty lessons. Four o'clock and calm skies... Four o'clock and calm skies... Your father will work again as a guard in Guanabacoa. Batabano is killing him, son. Think about us a little. Your rebelliousness is only harming your father. Mother, what my father has always done is try to take away everything that Mendive has given me. I will keep on staying there and from time to time come back here. Pepe, be sure to come this weekend. -He's brutish. Stay with Mendive. -Chata, stop it! Look at the circus acrobat! Pepe, don't look! Micaela, these are the books Mendive told me to bring. Put them on the table, little by little. and mind the candle chimney! Rafael told me he'd work on them tonight. But I didn't think there were so many. Now, Mr. Acrobat, take them to our room little by little. Pepe, give me a kiss. Amanda, let me finish tidying your hoopskirt. I doubly congratulate you. First, for being a good Cuban, and second, for being a good poet. although you still need a little to reach Lord Byron's unfathomable mystery. Your father came to see me today. Calm down, Pepe. You'll continue to stay here. But Mariano is concerned, Pepe... and he's right. I'm speaking to you as a teacher. Don't abandon your principles, but I'm asking you to be more cautious, Pepe. There is a lot of repression. The volunteers are more recalcitrant than the army itself; they're watching the school. Now I want to tell you a secret, as a friend. The man you saw two days ago in my rooms is Francisco Leon, a contact with Céspedes' insurrectionists. He'll be hiding here a few days until we can... Don Rafael! Don Rafael, General Dulce declared freedom of the press! "The Chamarreta". the Cuban newspaper that tastes like a machete and smells like a weed. Let everyone enter the theater with their weeding hoes. Hoe in hand everyone! The performance today will be dedicated to some insol... vent... No, no, no... to the insu... Come in..."Tricks for an Old Dog..." Fermín and Pepe are coming here from the printer's. They should be here by now. Look at those over there, in the bar... I'm sure they are camouflaged volunteers. Some in the audience are whistling like possessed. -Whistling is all right. -Whistling? Better to shout. But there are audiences that should be whistled at. This is a promising night... Pepe, there's almost no time. Fermín, you go first. When I fix it up and get the galley proof, I'll catch up. Ladies and gentlemen, now we have: "No New Tricks for an Old Dog" I like to see the Cuban girl... There's a group of volunteers armed to the teeth. You'll see the theater on a war footing! Bravo, gentlemen! Wonderful! As punctual as a Brit on Saturday! That's how I like it. But he has no shame... But many of us here do have a sense of shame. Yes! Wait a moment...there are some who don't, either good so-so, or bad. Those who do not say with me: Long live the land that grows sugar cane! -Long live Céspedes! -Viva! Viva! Long live free Cuba! Long live free Cuba! Please leave! Quickly! Run! Come in quick! Volunteers almost burnt down Villanueva! They've take over the streets. You know they're watching us. And they'll stop at nothing. Help me with the back doors! I closed all the windows in the upper floor. National integrity! National integrity! Havana's streets are ours! Long live Spain with honor! Death to the schemers! Down with the traitors! I'll kill the first one who tries to come in. Come out of there! National Integrity! I'll go with Micaela and the child. Sons of bitches! National Integrity! Come on! We're moving on! Everyone to the Spanish Club! -Calm down. I'll go out. -They are here again. Those are volunteers knocking. Calm down...Hide. Hide! Bastards! Shit! I'll go see what's going on. I'm here to find my son. -Leonor, what is this madness? -Where is he? Where is he? It's much more dangerous in the streets than here, volunteers... -I won't have him killed. -Volunteers are everywhere! Come, Pepe. The girls are alone. -Long live Spain, with honor! -Long live Spain, with honor! Long live Spain, with honor! Shout 'long live Spain with honor!' I am Spanish sir, a Canarian. We honor Spain. Really? Tonight everyone shouts it. Those who don't, offend Spain. Yes...yes... And what about him? Is he dumb? We honor Spain. His father is in the army. Mariano Martí. He did nothing. He is my son. Madam, I can read in his face that he was in the theater. We honor Spain. Don't do anything to him. He's my son. Are you afraid of something? Come on, shout it! Long live Spain with honor! Shout it, shout! You won't? Look what happens to schemers like you! Look! Death to insurrection! No, no, no! Pepe, shout it! Shout, Pepe! See? I'll blow your brains out right here. You are afraid, aren't you? Do you want to be the next one? Pepe, shout! Shout! Shout! Long live Spain, Pepe! Do it for me, Pepe! Do it for me, Pepe! Long live Spain! Do it for me! Very well, shout it. Once more! José Julian? José Julian Martí? Let him go. He was a pupil of min in school. His father is loyal to Spain. Forgive me, son. Forgive me! Nothing happened, Mariano. It was madness on my part. I thought... Go to your room! To your room, I said! You too, Leonor. So I break my back...sweating, killing myself in the streets, and you can't even think of your own family. I very clearly said that you were to be home early, don't mess about with disloyalty leave aside all that patriotic nonsense they've put into your head and don't screw up my job because it feeds you too. Look... You almost killed your mother! And for what? To please Mendive? Because you do fulfill your duties with him. And your duty here, Pepe? The duty you have here? I know my duties. Kneel down and apologize to your mother and your family. Kneel down! Kneel, I say, damn it! -Stop hitting him! -Stop it, please! Mariano, please. He already apologized to me. Don't hit him. We better talk outside. I can't go to school anymore. My father doesn't want to see me with "Mendive's rebels." -Then what are you? -This can't go on, Fermín. They'll kill us. My father knows repression will increase. -What about your word? -This will get increasingly... What about your word, Carlos? From the beginning you were aware that there'd be repression. You said you'd get part of the money for the newspaper. Not after Villanueva. Don't count on me. I'm out. Let's go, Fermín. We'll have Free Homeland without Carlos. -They took Rafael to jail. -What did they say? There's no charge, just because of his ideas. And a cockade rosette I had in my writing desk. They hit him, Pepe, in front of the girls. They'll close down our school. This cannot be, Micaela. How can they close it down? They will, because they want to finish us. They will. No, Micaela. It can't be. Better take your things and go back home, Pepe. There's nothing to be done. Your sisters were waiting all night for you. Come in. -Look. All this is for you. -What's this? You're sixteen today, Pepe. We wanted to celebrate. I'll make you some coffee and milk. One o'clock and calm skies! BARS Mr. Mendive: I'm working from 6 in the morning to 8 at night. I earn 4 and a half ounces, which I give to my father. He makes me suffer more every day. He has hurt me so much that I admit to you, with all my blunt frankness you well know, that only the hope of seeing you again has kept me from killing myself. Your letter has saved me... Here are my wages, father. Perfect. Leonor, we're moving on Saturday. Pepe, look at this ground plan. These are lands that can be exploited as quarries. it could be here... with what is left of this and something I can borrow I think we will get ahead. Pepe...come. Wait. -Pepe...Come on. -Wait. -Good morning, Don Felipe. -Good morning, Don Beltran. What can I do for you? I wanted to know how you were, how business was... Very well. The way things are going... Don Felipe, I need to take my coffee break. Go. Don't worry. When you're back bring me the papers in Azcarate's office. Thank you. They're on death row. The execution is tomorrow at 11. The rallying cry will fill the square. You must be there, Pepe. Repent, Pancho. Repent. Do it for me: Repent. Repent, Pancho. Repent. Give a clean soul to God. That's all we have now. Repent. I ask permission to commend my soul to God. I only want to beg forgiveness and say a prayer for my soul. I apologize for all I have been guilty of. And before God I repent all my sins and hand my soul in total contrition But I die convinced that... the insurrection will triumph! -Long live Céspedes! -Viva! -Long live Free Cuba! -Viva! -Death to Céspedes! -Death Long live insurrection! Chameleon! Coward! I should have thrown him in the ditch. when he denied me money for Free Homeland Read this letter. What will he say? He can't answer. He's a scoundrel Fermín, Carlos has turned traitor. He has to answer this letter. Look, Pepe. I'll disembowel him all the same I won't sign this letter. Damned rain! Oh, Master Martí. Master Fermín was taken to jail with his brother and others. I swear my brother was just clowning with our neighbor. -Sofia... -No. Mercedita. The one with the hair like Céspedes. My brother was at the window and called her "insurrectionist" and she replied with something that made them laugh. Volunteers just happened to pass just then They were drunk and thought they were being laughed at One can't even laugh these days, Pepe. Your father wasn't there? Father arrived in the afternoon, a little before I did. We were having dinner when they came with an arrest warrant and turned the house upside down. -Did they find anything? -No. I have everything hidden with Salustiano, as you told me to. And the letter for Carlos? Did you hide it? It was in my room. But, Pepe, there was nothing compromising in it, was there? - Let's go, get going! - Wait a moment! What's the meaning of this? José Martí is my employee and he's under my protection. Now he's under ours. Find yourself a new employee. -Where are you taking him? -Where all dissidents go. I am a Spanish military man and you can't enter my home. Let's go! Upstairs! Leonor! Upstairs! Run, Amelia, run! Search the rooms. All of them! Stay still! Stay Still! Shame on you all! -An Outrage! A thousand times over! -Stay back! Why did you come all alone, Mother? I don't want the girls seeing you like that. They'd suffer. -Mother, Anita could've come. -I'll bring her on Thursday. She can't stop crying. Are you sleeping well, son? -Your eyes are... -I slept seven hours, Mother. Yes, but on the floor... And it's very cold. I will ask them to give you another sailcloth. You father is petitioning his bosses and Portillo. But we must wait. Son... Was it Carlos de Castro who went to Batabano with you? -I want to see his father. -No, Mother, how will you... That letter will condemn you. They're executing people for anything. Why this martyrdom? Why this useless sacrifice? Don't you see you could be home now helping your Father, who's about ready to drop? You're talking like Father. No, Pepe. I'm talking like your mother. Deep down, Mariano and you are alike. That's been our damnation. I wasn't born to be a shopkeeper. Don't be unfair, Pepe. Don't. Your father always fought for justice... although today we don't know what justice is. In the end, we've resigned ourselves to having nothing. Do you want to do the same? Look at me... I’ve been crying for three days. I can't eat a thing. I can't sleep. I feel like I'm dying. Is this the price of your justice? Why must WE pay? Why don't you think a bit more about your family, your kind, and less about yourself? Repent, Pepe, please. Tell them you repent. Do it for me. -Tell them you did nothing. -Stop, Mother. -Do it for me. -Stop. -Enough, enough. -Do it for me. Remember the night you came to school for me and took me home? I forgave you that day, Mother. Forgive me now. I brought you some custard. But they said I had to leave it in the mess hall. I've seen so many in front of the garrote. And you are boys just starting your lives. You should weigh all the years you have before you on the scales. Nothing is more precious The prosecutor is asking for the death penalty It's serious. a retraction... Soldier, take Fermín to his cell. José Julian Mari Perez. I am a friend of your father's. from Bocanegra... He's a great friend, yes, and a great man. especially for his rectitude and sense of justice. You should have known him in his youth in Valencia. always defending his brothers. Have you thought about how hard losing his son would hit him? You don't have to tell me my father's virtues. All I know about justice, I owe it to him. Pepe, I'm Federico The twins from school, remember? The Attorney wants a culprit, whether there's evidence or not. Either you or Fermín. -How's your brother? -He lost a leg in Oriente, fighting the insurrectionists. He's starting work in a cigar factory. Insolent laughs were hurled. And each guffaw was and insult to Spain. To offend the volunteers is a criminal act. It is a sacrilegious act polluting the sanctuary of the Motherland Mockery was not enough and here, in this letter, the most disgraceful and coarse offenses are hurled against an honorable defender of our country's bastion, a healthy and honest youngster. Just reading it is enough. Comrade: Have you dreamed with the glory of apostates? Do you know how apostasy was punished in ancient times? We expect that a disciple of Rafael Maria de Mendive will not fail to answer this letter. signed, José Julian Martí Perez Mendive has already been removed from this land so that our scions do not grow up crooked but underhanded apostates, spurious children of Spain, still exist. Mr. President, Magistrates. for all the aforementioned I accuse José Julian Martí Perez of the serious offense of apostasy and sedition as the author of the letter and Fermín Valdes Dominguez of an act of complicity. The state rests. That letter was written in my room. That is true. My signature is not there, but I am also responsible for it. -I am also it's author... -No, No, Fermín, you know I am the one who wrote that letter and the Attorney is right when he says that... you have no right to talk until you're given the floor What right to talk do you mean? My right to speak has never existed. I've spent my entire life seeing how because of you all my family has to survive in poverty, seeing the people I love humiliated, alienated from me because I have ideas that are not in your interest. And I have had to keep this in here without any of you ever giving me the right to speak, to express what I feel. Since I feel and think, I am not a spurious son because I was born in Cuba. I am a son of Cuba. Like most Cubans all I want is the freedom of my land and of those who think as I do. I wrote that letter. It was not him. It was I. And my principle, my ideas, are in it. I think Cubans who bare arms against Cuba are just traitors. And you can condemn me for it. Condemn me... But you're the ones who are condemned. Reason is not imposed by force. Long live Cuba! Long live Free Cuba! I declare the trial closed, pending sentence! Fermín Valdez Dominguez, six months imprisonment. José Julian Martí Perez, six years with hard labor. Because of this, Your Excellency, I see my son today with the worst criminals and dragging a shackle. Unable to resist such a misfortune and trusting your merciful heart, I dare to beg your Excellency to please pardon my unfortunate son from this harsh punishment... Madam, the Captain General cannot see you today. We are very sorry. We'll notify you again. But the stars are hidden. So do I. But not with fear José Julian Martí! Visit! The Captain General may receive you. But be quick. And my Mother and sisters? They're well. Chata...is pregnant. Your mother... wrote a letter to the Captain General to intercede and... Please read this My daughters and I beg of you, kneeling, mercy for my child. Rise up, please. I know your son's case. Martí... But I don't think I can do much, Madam. It was a court martial and sentences are irrevocable. But because he is so young... perhaps... Severino, let us look into that possibility OK? But it does not fall into my jurisdiction, Madam I am very sorry. I can't promise anything. He's a child, sir. Have pity on him. Your mother made you these little pillows. Let me put them on. But, how can they do this? -How can they keep you like this? -Stand up, Father. Stand up. It's nothing. Let's go! Visit is over! Back to work! I have to go. Take the pillows with you. Get up, let's go... José Martí was pardoned from jail and deported to Madrid months later. His devotion for Cuba's independence led to his death in battle on May 10, 1895 His poetic work is among the most profound in Latin American poetry. In his Simple Verses he wrote: I sleep in my rocky bed My sweet and deep dreams: A bee brushes my mouth And the world grows on my chest. To Beatrix Maggi
