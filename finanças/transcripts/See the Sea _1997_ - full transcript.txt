SEE THE SEA May I speak to Mr. Noyer? Thank you. Hello. Paul Noyer, please. His wife. Do you know where I can reach him? I've been trying for several days now... Yes, I know. Ask him to call me when you speak to him. He has the number. Thank you. Anyone home? I'm looking for a place to crash on the island. Sorry, this isn't a hotel. Yeah, but you have a big yard... Excuse me, my baby's in the bath. It's yours? Why yes! My daughter, Siofra. So I was saying, you've got a big yard. Maybe I could pitch my tent. It's my husband's property. He's away. I'd have to ask him. When is he back? I'm not sure, he's stuck at work in Paris. The camp site is full, you have lots of land, you two are alone here... I won't bother you. Do you breast-feed? She's on the bottle now. How old is she? 10 months. Go ahead and pitch your tent over there. Thanks, I'll keep out of your way. How long will you stay? 2 or 3 days. Good evening. My fridge is full. It's silly for you to eat out here. Would you like to come in for dinner? Sure. Great. I'll go fix something. Would you like more wine? Don't be so formal. Okay. Where did you come from? I was working as a nanny on the coast. I got fed up and wanted a change, so I came here. It's quiet, not many people. - You travel a lot? - That's all I do. I can't stay put more than 4 days. Alone? I hate group tours. Don't you get scared? I do the scaring. It's funny. I was like you. When I was an au pair in Paris, I got bored and took off hitchhiking with a crazy friend. Once, we were in Tunisia, walking along a country road. Suddenly, night fell. It got completely dark. We started getting cold. We heard wolves howling in the woods. We were really scared, lost, no one around, nothing. Suddenly we heard bells. Something brushed against our legs. It was sheep. And a shepherd. So we asked him if he knew where we could sleep. He invited us to his place. We got to his house. It was totally dark. He led us into a big room. There were cushions everywhere. It was so dark in there. He locked us in and left. We thought, he's gone to get his friends. They're going to come back and rape us! So then... we heard footsteps... we didn't dare say a word... we were holding hands, barely breathing. He opened the door. He was alone. He motioned for us to follow him. We followed in silence. Suddenly, we see before us a room filled with candles. And there on the table... a feast fit for a king! Sheep's heads boiling in a giant pot. His two wives and all his children were there. So we sat down with them and ate until dawn. It seems so long ago now. You don't travel anymore? Yes, but... with a husband and child it's not the same. You miss it? I'm happy. Want some herb tea? I prefer coffee. Good morning! I made breakfast. Hello. Sleep well? Nah, the ground was hard. Coffee? - Orange juice? - No thanks. You can use the bathroom if you want. I'll be right back. - Did you have a bath? - Yeah. I need to go out. Would you mind watching Siofra? Great. I'll go get ready. I won't be long. Once there was a little ship that had never taken a trip. Hey ho hey ho sailor... Sailor sail across the water. What do you see? Some guys fucking. I can't see them. They're in the woods. Put on your suit, I've got sunblock. Anyway, I'm bored. I'm leaving. - Already? - Yeah. Later. Okay, see you later. We're back from the beach! Are you there? So you're back? How was the beach? Oh, it was... good. Can you pass me the towel? Can you take her? How was it giving birth? Great. Didn't it hurt? Of course. Did you have an epidural? No. Why not? It was my first. I wanted to really experience the pain... know how it felt. Did you like it? I think I did. Did you have an episiotomy? Why do you ask? No reason. Curiosity. I didn't need it. I tore naturally. From where to where? A bit everywhere. To the anus? Some shit out the pussy after. I've never heard that. Sure, if the wall between the vagina and the rectum tears. It can get infected. They sew you up? Did you shit during delivery? If you keep asking these questions, you'll never want a baby. I already had one. You? Where is it? It is dead. I'm sorry, I... That's okay. I had it aborted. Ah, it's you! Yes... How are you? Very well. Siofra's fine. Tomorrow? I miss you too. I love you too. Your husband? Yes. He'll be here tomorrow. What time? On the 10 o'clock boat. I'll leave before then. There's no need. You'll see, he's nice. You can sleep inside if you like. Okay. This way. - This all right? - Yeah. - Well, goodnight then. - Goodnight. 5 francs. - Thanks. Enjoy your stay. - Thank you. Honey! It's me! Anyone in there?
