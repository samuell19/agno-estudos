The Guilloux affair: Jeanne Dufour talks. He couldn't leave the Paris region. Dropped by the underworld, without money... ...his arrest shouldn't be far away. We found his car in the Yvellnes. Bourrier, do what's necessary. Right away, Chief. BEYOND FEAR In the house, Varda. Anywhere, Varda. You'll appreciate the quality of Varda electric cable. Despite the police prefect's announcement... ...Rene Guilloux is still on the run. After the arrest of his mistress... ...Inspector Bourrier and his men... ...are convinced that, without money and abandoned by the underworld... ...he couldn't leave the Paris region. His arrest could therefore happen within 24 hours. La Case... Foulon... Gombo. Georgeaud vouches for you... So for me, no problem. It'll be for tomorrow, at 12.30. For the reasons you know, I won't move from here. Legoff will lead in my place. There'll be 7 of you... You 3... ...the 3 of them... and an electronics specialist. A friend sent him to me from Toulouse. I don't know him, but my friend vouches for him. As soon as he gets here, I'll give all the details to you. When will he get here? This evening. As soon as he's in Paris, he'll call. Yes? Morisi here. Where are you? Austerlitz station. I'm sending you a car. No, I don't want to wait, it's too watched here. So where are you going? Chez Larrieu, in Ponthieu. You know? Franklin Roosevelt Ave? Yes that's it. I'll send you a white Ford Capri... ...rego 88480 BW 92. "BW 92." Good. See you soon. Good evening. A martini. Another martini, please. Thanks. - What do I owe you? - 4.40. Keep the change. The local phone. Downstairs. I'll give you the line. 975 23 32. Quick, please. I'm in a hurry. - It's still engaged. - Try it again. Okay, yes. I'll be there tomorrow night. [ARREST IMMINENT] All right. Have a good trip? Excellent. - Malot is well? - He's fine. Now that we're all here, I'll give you details. Like I've told you, I won't be able to participate. I need you. I'm staking my life on it. It's sort of my last chance. There, there are 700 million. On the ground floor. Just opposite... ...Le Printemps and the Galeries Lafayette. You, at 12.30... ...will detonate a charge in the Galeries basement. And you... ...will do the same in the Printemps basement. The explosions will keep the cops busy for at least an hour. At 1 o'clock, Legoff and the others... ...will do the bank. There should be no problem, everything has been settled. Answer it. Hello, yes? Hold on, I'll give you to him. Hello? Don't move, I'll send another car. Who are you? "Claude Balard, real estate agent." "Chemin de la Cote, Villennes." What does it mean? Claude Balard, real estate agent. Chemin de la CÃ´te, Villennes. A customer's driver was supposed to pick me up at 9pm... ...and take me to a hotel. I didn't know the driver, nor the hotel, only my client. I confused your car. That's all that happened. Are you kidding me? All my papers are in my briefcase. My licence, my identity card, my voter card, everything. My office address. Everything. The name of your client? Fellcian. My client's name is Fellcian. Check. The file is in the briefcase. With the name, description of the property, pictures, everything. There. There. You seem to have told the truth. You'd understand, with what you know... ...we can't let you go. Let's say... From tomorrow afternoon, you'll be free. If you do anything stupid... ...you're dead. You'll be quiet and go with these gentlemen. - The police! - This is a station. On the phone. On the phone. Get me the police. - There is no phone. - What's that? It's not a phone. What is it? This is a phone reserved to the sole needs of the service. I don't care. I'm using it. It's a question of life or death! - It had to be said. - The number of the gendarmerie? I don't know. I'll look in the directory. Hello, Grandma? Is that you, Claude? You should come. No! No! Balard, did you call the cops? No. We're waiting for you. If you're not here in 1 hour, we'll kill your wife and your son. I said in 1 hour. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! I want a doctor! I want a doctor! I want to call a doctor! I want a doctor! A doctor's ruled out. You'll keep quiet, or your son's dead. Get that into your head until her father get's here. Go make us some coffee. Come on. Hello yes? Hold on... Georgeaud? He just called. We'll be there in an hour and a half. Thanks. Go on, answer! Hello? Hello, Nicole? You're there? Yes. She's here and she's waiting for you. You've got 5 minutes to show up. I won't say anything, not a word. Give me back my wife and my son! At the time of the hold-up, I demand that... Give them back to me and I say nothing. I will talk to my wife every half hour, otherwise I call the police. I give you 5 minutes to turn up. Out of the question! I have my gun on your wife's head. Here, I'll give her to you. It's true, Claude. What's true? He has his revolver... ...pressed on my temple. He just killed Mummy. Another man is upstairs with Alain. Do what he tells you. I beg you! That's right. Do what you're told. You'll kill the 3 of us. If my wife doesn't answer in 30 minutes, I'll call the police. I'll take care of the kid. Don't be stupid. Do we wait for the cops? No... As long as we hold his wife and his kid, he won't talk. Legoff! Don't move. You accepted the job. I said we're staying... So you stay. Give me your gun. Guilloux was there until last night. - How many victims? - Professor Taille and his wife. Clues? We're questioning a kitchen hand... ...and there's information given by the Verneull station-master. A major development in the manhunt. We'll cross to Georges LaTour, at police headquarters. Georges LaTour, live from the police headquarters. An event, of a savagery that revolts public consciousness has just happened. 2 people were murdered in the Dalat Inn... Professor Taille, Nobel Prizewinner in Medicine... ...world famous for his work on cancer... ...and his wife... The owner of the inn, Raoul Georgeaud, having fled... ....it was possible to find a member of staff. This man just spoke. He admitted that Rene Guilloux was at the inn that night. The professor and his wife were the victims... ...of a settlement of accounts which did not concern them. In the act of shooting someone else... ...Rene Guilloux shot down the teacher and his wife. There's no clue as to the identity of the other individual... ...who was seen by the Verneul stationmaster. He gave an inconclusive description. We're waiting on reports of new developments... ...which we'll pass on to you in the next bulletins. A car's waiting. Who is it? He's the father of a friend of Alain. He drives him to school. Tell him what you want, but have him go away. Alain is sick. I'm keeping him at home. Thanks. Alright, thanks. Bye. - What's the matter? - Nothing. You seem tired. Yes, I didn't have time to shave. Anything happening? Mr Fellcian telephoned. He was surprised... Yes I know. It's nothing much. Go get me some cigarettes. I don't want these! You usually smoke them, don't you? I want to change today. Go get me... Go get me some Campanellas. - Campanellas? - Yes, the little cigars. Cigars? Yes, go get them for me. I'll finish my specification sheet, and then I'll go. Stop arguing. You told me it had to be ready by 10 o'clock. Its almost finished. Do as I tell you. Come on! Good grief! Hello? Nicole? Are you still there? And Alain, where is he? What are they doing at the moment? Where are you? At my office. How do I know you haven't talked? The life of my wife and son depends on my silence. Good. What are you going to do now? Keep silent... ...and call every half hour. Give me your word that you'll release them. Why would you believe that I'd keep my word? I don't have a choice. All right. Are you playing ball with us? Yes, I consider myself an accomplice. I don't have much sympathy for banks. Wreck the place. And then, I don't like the police. When I was a student... Enough! You talk too much. Maybe yes... Just to explain... I don't need an explanation. Now listen carefully. In short... You shut your mouth and you don't move from your desk. You check your wife every half hour. You change nothing in your habits. If you do nothing stupid, and everything goes well... ...I'll give you back your family this afternoon at 2pm. Understood? All right. Thanks. Can I speak to my wife? I can't take it anymore! I can't take it any more! It's too hard! Calm down, Nicole. Everything's settled. I assure you everything's settled. Stay calm, darling. In a few hours, it will all be over. In the meantime, obey them. Tell Alain that I'm here... ...that I'm not quitting on him. It's a matter of hours. No more. We must hang on. Nicole... I know you'll hang on. Yes. Now I'm going to hang up. I'll call back in half an hour. I love you, darling. See you soon. Yes, Claude. Give me his wallet. No, not that! No! Let him be! We know where he is. Send La Case, Gombo and Foulon, right away... ...to 53, Franklin-Roosevelt Ave... A real estate agency. He's there. As soon as it's done, call me. We'll finish off here and we'll join you. Thank you, Genevieve. I'm going to get a shave. I'll be back in half an hour. I bought your cigars when you knew you were going out? Are you making a fool of me, Sir? No I wasn't. I hadn't thought of going out, then. I'm sorry. - Hello, who do you want? - Mr Balard. He went out. What's it about? It's personal. If you want to wait for him, he'll be back in half an hour. He's at the hairdresser's. Thanks. We'll come back. Good. All right. What's wrong? I have to call. What is it? Don't talk! I beg you, don't talk. - What's the matter? - You mustn't speak. Hello? Nicole, it's me. Claude... Where are you? Your men missed me. I'm calling you from a cafe. Nothing's changed, I'll not speak to anyone. I understand you, you know. I don't judge anyone... If it was me... Stop your bullshit. We're at the same point... You always run... ...and I have your wife and your kid. Hope everything goes well. Call me back in half an hour. I need an explanation. Talk. Who was that? Rene Guilloux. Rene Guilloux... He killed your mother. He's threatening to kill Alain and Nicole. He killed Mum?! Why? Whatever for? It's a story that's impossible to believe. An insane story! Rene Guilloux mistook me for for someone else. Last night, yes. He took me for a certain... Borisi, Forisi... A man from his gang. Forisi should have gone up in the car I took. We had a date... in an inn. - You understand? - Not very well. Because it's inexplicable! Rene Guilloux took me for Forisi. I learned that his gang were to rob a bank around 1pm. Guilloux explained everything to me. When he realised that I wasn't Forisi... He wanted to kill me. I escaped him... ...but he had my papers... my address. With his killers, he took Nicole and Alain as hostages. But Mum...? Why did they kill my mother? I don't know. It was Nicole who told me that they'd killed her. And now? What now? Aren't you doing something? You have to go to the police. If I talk, he'll kill them. He'll kill them whether you talk or not. Like my mother. She's my sister... It concerns me as much as you. What are you doing? - I'm calling the police. - No, you have no right. I have as many rights as you. I won't let them kill the family. Francesco, I beg you... He's a maniac! Our only chance is to obey him. We don't argue. We have to notify the police. You're going to kill Nicole and Alain! You're the one who's going to kill them! No! I didn't want that you get involved. This story is only about me! This is my son. My wife and my son. Their lives depend on me. If it wasn't for my brother-in-law, you wouldn't have known anything. Guilloux would have kept his word. Oh yes...! He would've returned my wife and son. He would've kept them alive for me. So let me decide this situation myself. We understand you, Mr Balard. But what you ask... Let me take care of it. That's all I ask. - Mr Balard... - This case is mine! Sorry, Mr Balard... this matter is up to us. Firstly because your wife is also the sister of Mr Grimaldi. Then and above all... ...because Rene Guilloux is preparing a hold-up. They will kill a lot of people, if we don't intervene. If you intervene, there will be deaths on both sides. - But you care about your Wild West. - That's enough, Mr Balard. You're going too far. I've already been too indulgent. Don't you think properly? It was you who told me they intend blowing up Galeries Lafayette. Do you believe that these fireworks will be of no consequence? And you don't know Guilloux. He'll never give you back your wife and son. He'll kill them without hesitation I assure you. The crooks gave their word. He just tried to kill you. That's not the same... He never promised that he wouldn't shoot me. I worry about my wife and my son. Our role is to protect them. Yours is to trust us. Trust you? Do you think that's easy? In this kind of business, it always ends in disaster. Listen, Mr Balard... We have no reason to indulge men like you. The non-denunciation of a criminal is an act punishable by law. You've made yourself the accomplice of a criminal. Your duty was to warn us. Ours is to prevent it from doing harm. And that's what we'll do, with or without you. And that, in defiance of the life of two innocent people?! I am free to decide alone about the fate of my family. You don't have the right to deny it. You're free within the framework of a society subject to laws. We are here to enforce the law, and to follow it. It's an attack on my freedom as a citizen. I have the right to decide for myself! Yes, to decide alone about the fate of my family... ...of the fate of my wife, of the fate of my son... ...of what is dearest to me. We are in a democracy. I will warn the press. I have political and business connections... And even in your arena. Yes, in your arena... I'll go to court! There's sufficient reason... I'll accuse you of murder, by abuse of authority, ...of a woman, of a child! Murderer! You will understand justice! Justice... Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! That's calmed him down. But above all, take care of it. Goodbye, Chief Inspector. If he doesn't call, they'll panic. Mr Balard... ...you need to call your wife. If you don't call, they'll get angry. You know what I'm saying to you. Hello? It's me, Nicole. What's happening? Right now, everything's calm. They are waiting. It's going to be over soon, darling. Give him to me. Where are you? In a cafe. Why didn't you call sooner? I was looking for an isolated phone booth. We're not going to stay here. It's too dangerous. You could crack at any moment. We'll take your wife and your kid with us. Give me a number... I'll call you. Where are you taking my wife and son? Otherwise, I'll never be sure. You'll get to have your wife on the line. So what's this number? Apart from my office, I don't know where to go. Go back to your office. No, that's out of the question. Once was enough. Find something else. Call me back in half an hour. Half an hour, no more. You understood? You won't know anymore where they are. But we'll act with the utmost precaution. It's our job. We'll do everything to save them. That okay with you? They're leaving. Establish a cordon around the villa. We've got barely half an hour. Impossible to organize anything serious. We have to put all sorts of vehicles together. Anything we could try would be dangerous. You have to stall for time. You see? You can't do it. You tell me not to panic... ...while your orders are a disaster. Mr Balard! There's nothing to add. I don't trust you. I've never trusted you. Don't count on me any more. It's over. If disaster happens, you are responsible. Mr Balard, you need to rest. It's essential. Chauvaud, I entrust him to you. Take him to Preteux. Bourrier, get surveillance organised immediately. We can't set up a regular action plan. He might slip away in the meantime. We must duplicate the system, with prompt intervention. Explain yourself. We use a GDF-EDF truck and half a dozen uniforms. The Lannion method, yes. Yes. 5 men would be enough. A half hour to get ready and reach the villa. The truck is equipped with a radio. In the event of an exit, they'd act right away. What you're forgetting, Bourrier... ...Guilloux doesn't let himself be outmaneuvered. And EDF-GDF... an amateur would be wary. We don't have a choice. There's not time for surveillance to be ready. It's the only way to win time and to cover us. And the wife and child? Well I think the most important thing is that he doesn't escape, with them. Otherwise, it's all over for them. I am partial to letting Mrs Balard know... ...that we've been warned. How? Grimaldi and Argoux, in work gear, just have to ring the doorbell... ...to inform Mrs Balard that the crew is ready... ...to start work in the garden. That should warn her. It's too risky. You're playing with fire. When you're working with dynamite, you're obligated. I am convinced that it's necessary to go all out, right away. Your opinion, Mr Grimaldi? I agree with the commissioner. I'm not sure I like it, but as you say... ...we don't have much choice. Off you go. Follow me, Mr Grimadi. As soon as the team is on site... ...I want immediate radio contact. I'll choose the time to go ahead. Get dressed. Get dressed! Hurry up! Take me to the Chief Inspector. Do what I say. Mr Balard asks to see you. Get him here. Right away, Sir. Come with me. How do you feel, Mr Balard? Have you recovered? You're preparing something. Everything will be fine. Sorry, Chief Inspector but I think we need to tell him the truth. We've sent a team to the villa. Your brother-in-law is with them. You promised me that you'd be acting with caution. We're acting to save your wife and son. It's possible, provided we move as quickly as possible. Oh no... For you, what matters, is to arrest Rene Guilloux. You don't care, for the life of my wife and my son. A mere detail. As for me, I'm just a nuisance. In the way. To be silenced with needles. That's enough, Balard. We're engaged in a very difficult operation. If you refuse to cooperate... ...we'll be obliged to secure you. So be reasonable. Rene...! A van. There are 2 coming in. You're going to see them. You have to get them to go away. We'll be upstairs with your kid. There are problems with the electricity main. We have to replace the line. We need to get into your garden. I just wanted to warn you. It's impossible, I have to leave. Your absence doesn't bother us. It's impossible. - Come back another day. - Sorry, Ma'am... ...the crew is already here. It does not change anything. My husband is adamant... "No one in our garden during our absence." Alright. Well... In that case, we'll do what we can outside. Your husband is a total bastard. He's grassed on us. With us, talking to the cops is never forgivable. You're wrong. He didn't talk. I was actually expecting workers. And then our law is not yours. We don't have the same convictions, nor the same morality. If my husband had talked... I think he would've done the right thing. Shut your mouth! Because I know that whatever happens, you'll end up killing us For fun, as you'd say. You're wrong. I've always been steady. Hey, Rene! What are we going to do? We'll soon be fixed. Don't panic. Hello? Hello? Yes, I just saw her. She was on edge. I couldn't get into the house. I saw nothing. We have started the work. In case of exit... ...we'll call you back... ...and will only act on orders from the Chief Inspector. Out. Officer-in-charge Servange here... Area control is set up. Surveillance is in place. We can move immediately. Thank you, Servange. Now you have to call, Mr Balard. Mr Balard... you know what to say. Not a word more. Hello? I want my wife. You haven't kept your mouth shut, you bastard. What's got into you? There are 5 cops disguised as guys from the EDF in the garden, you shit. Your wrong. I haven't talked. I guarantee. It's me, last week... I asked them to come. Stop taking me for a schmuck! Stop, yourself! If you don't trust me, send one of your men.. ...to check out my so-called cops. You'll be reassured. The lives of my wife and my son depend on it. You've nothing to risk. Alright. Don't move. Go to the car and drive away. If nothing goes wrong, we scram. You're crazy, Rene. I don't like fairies. You want to kill me? Send Arnaud instead. Not me, Rene! Rene! Rene! Hello? One of them just came out. He's coming down the stairs. He looks terrified. He starting the car. He's reversing. He's stopped in front of the house. Balard, You seem to have spoken the truth. Not my style. I'm telling the truth. It's normal. Now we're going to split. At 2.30 you'll have your wife and your kid. Where can I call you back? At my office. At your office? Yes. I'll have my wife on the phone while you're at the bank? Alright... I'll call you back at noon. Put my wife on. It'll be over. It's going to be over, darling. It'll all be over. Yes, I know. Restore contact. Watch out, they're coming out. I formally order you... ...not to make a move, no matter what. Go get dressed. - Arnaud! - Yes? - Get the kid ready. We're leaving. - OK. Georgeaud? We're coming. They just came out. The car is heading towards the Groux road. Everything is set up at the intersection. Tardieu here. They just passed me. Bypassing Villennes. Heading towards Poissy. They're on the road to Poissy. I passed the baton to Daran. This is Police Officer Daran. I just took over. We're on the road to Poissy. We're passing the swimming pool. We'll hit Church Square. I'll pass the baton to Calfan. Perrier her. I'm coming to take over from Calfan. We're driving through Saint Germain forest. We crossing Saint-Germain. We're Place du Chateau. I pass the baton to Muller. We're still in Saint Germain. We're moving towards the Pecq roundabout. We're at the Pecq roundabout. They just stopped at 53 rue de Paris, in Pecq. They're entering a corridor, next to a grocery store. Out. It's me. Rene. They've joined the rest of the gang. Seal off the neighbourhood. Make sure they don't notice anything. Mr Balard... It's time to get yourself to your office. He can call at any moment. These officers will accompany you. Bourrier, Chief Inspector. They're just underway. Everything's ready for interception within a radius of 3 km. As instructed we'll intervene... as soon as they've reached this radius, in a few minutes. As far as possible from the department store. Think of the hostages. As agreed. As far as possible. Nicole? I'll put her on. In 1 hour, everything will be over. You'll be in clover. Don't be afraid, it's the end. I mean, it's ending. 1 hour, no more. Nicole? Hear me? Yes. Nicole, talk to me. I beg you, say anything, but talk to me. I'm just tired, Claude. Very tired. And I don't know what to tell you. And then... Anyway... ...since you say that in barely 1 hour... ...everything will be as before... ...might as well keep calm. We still have an hour. Yes, an hour is a long time. And I'm so tired. I beg you... ...let's not talk anymore. Okay darling... I don't want to tire you. I don't want to tire you. All right. The interception is over... There are no survivors. Over. The interception is over, Chief Inspector... No survivors. I'm joining you. - Can I get a milk? - Yes. Don't move. Police! Exit normally. - Where is he? - First door on the right. - Over there? - Yes. Clear the street! Get out immediately. Clear the street! Clear the street. Rene, you don't have a chance. Give yourself up. Rene, answer me. You hear me? I know you're up there. Answer! Rene, are you listening? First floor. The window with curtains. Rene, I'm asking you to come down. You're going to come down. Respond! You broke your word. You're going to pay. Nicole! 2 shots... The first for your wife. The second for your kid. Nicole! Answer me! Rene! Rene, it's me. It's Bourrier. The whole area's sealed off. Don't be an idiot. Rene, you have no choice. You hear me? Rene! Rene, you have no choice. Drive me there. Drive me there! I'm waiting for your answer. Speak, Rene. Rene, don't be a schmuck! Rene! Rene, don't be stupid! You have no chance. We know you have hostages, we can't shoot. Shut up! You'll do what I'm going to tell you! Bring me a car... ...and leave the engine running! You will clear the street! I'll come out with the woman and the kid! Their lives depend on you motherfuckers! I am waiting for your answer. Rene... Freinet here. We are waiting for the prosecutor. Without Him, we can't decide anything. We won't move. You have my word. Mum... - Where are we at? - He asked for a car. Your opinion? You have to do everything to save the hostages. That's my opinion too. Rene, can you hear me? We'll do what you asked. We'll give you a car and clear the street. Clear the streets! Get off the streets! Evacuate the street. But you stay calm, Rene. If you stay calm, everything will be fine. Stop your bullshitting and bring the car! No! Do you know how to drive? You'll go down first and you'll get behind the wheel. Get going! Where is he? He's coming out with your wife and son. Let me go there. Let him go. Behind the wheel. Quickly. Go on! Claude! Claude, no! Dad! We must act quickly. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
