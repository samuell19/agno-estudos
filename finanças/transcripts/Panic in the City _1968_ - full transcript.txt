(Dramatic Music) (Sirens) possible skull fracture alterations what do we have on him nurse? I've known identity doctor no papers or credentials you can come up to x-ray then run the pathology check let's call x-ray doctor I'll be right with you getting ready will you dick right move them over onto the table one We're ready Doctor Sounds like we've got a radiation leak doctor check the whole lab yesterday 150 ranges the highest emanations ever recorded in a human body worth 500 and that was Hiroshima wonder he's covered with radiation burn get these men into total isolation as quick as you can skip doctor a doctor his condition nullify his x-ray what about decontamination he's too far gone for that get him out of here and put the guard on his door make sure no one gets near him without the proper authorization so the moment we knew what it was we placed him in isolation and called the Atomic Energy Commission they in turn called you people and well it's funny as he come through at any time now he's been comatose ever since they brought him in by every indication he is going to remain that way until the end dr. Stevens meet Special Agent Pomeroy of the National Bureau of Investigation NBI you don't look like an NB I men to me mr. Pomeroy well you don't look like a doctor doctor oh but I am I have my diploma hanging on my office wall would you like to see it you're not being investigated doctor that's a relief mr. Pomeroy is here to find out who our friend in isolation is and when and how we got those burns dr. Stevens is our radiation specialist and I vouch for the validity of her diploma well should we go see our man you understand doctors kept confidential until we get more facts of course I'll alert the staff dr. Wilcox this is mrs. Pryor the police told her about the unidentified man who was brought in this morning from their description she thinks that my beer has been fried he's in there mrs. Baier you can seem for the window that your husband is from yeah I'm sorry I'll have to have his prints and a couple of pictures document prints years the pictures are out the high degree of radiation coming from his body would lock out the negative completely I see what you mean and I'll need his clothes for a lab check in Washington too well they are sealed in a lead-lined container and you can see Pam anywhere without salute safety anything else no that'll do it the time thing you better put this on Santa can be dangerous and when you come out you have to go through the contamination stainless we all have to do it right laughter noon I'm looking for a particular Van de Velde a marine see no we have quite a few do you know the catalogue number ten twenty to ten twenty to little chick huh yeah we have a request for that order can you deliver this evening 1022 right Oh standby you name Johnson that's right you got a phone call for supervisor said surgeon what's that guy got from ezel something like that three eight four three one did they leave the name supervisor just said it was urgent you want a phone I'll stand by for you this is how Johnson called you just never know all I had to go through to finally track you down there at the hospital so who is this the corner of $6 at 7:30 good night okay yeah thanks for spelling me sure well the fingerprints is negative so far that rules out him working in an atomic installation maybe the lab in Washington turned up something when they check his clothes I'll stick by the hospital you might come to and start talking dr. Stevens is on the line hello Doctor I'll be right over our man won't be talking he died last night he was dead when we checked him for treatment this morning I didn't think he'd go so fast it's hard to understand well how long does it usually take to bring a man on Oh ends on the amount of exposure he a degree of burn although this man had more than his share no atomic installation could possibly give off that kind of radiation there too well protected well where do you think he could have picked it up I wouldn't begin to know he was exposed to the raw metal uranium plutonium any of the heavier elements have been around the stuff without any protection whatsoever and you're of the opinion that he died of causes other than radiation I didn't say that I know but I'm asking for an autopsy anyway how soon can you do it we'll have to do it in isolation where he died wearing insulated suits I don't know what happened the autopsy shows the man you are guarding was murdered I told you I don't know what happened and you didn't leave his door even for a minute you're in trouble son all right all right I left for a while one of the orderlies hands me a piece of paper with a phone number on it the message says urgent you offer to take my place while I made the call you got the paper yeah how are we you're gone for five minutes maybe did you talk to some girl I don't remember at all only she remembers me we made a date but you didn't show up this orderly who relieved you you know I never saw him before did you describe him I think I could good I want you to give his discretion to one of our artists anything to help see what you can get no take your time how tall with him I don't know my size maybe a little taller numbers of payphones the Plaza Hotel thanks Jim fits right to look like I'll call the lab in Washington they should ever report in close man drop by my office when you get through here yes sir this is long I think and and straight okay what is mouth mouth kind of turns down run photostats passed them around the boys and get some to the police department when Joel tell them we don't want him arrested just locate it yes sir well the clothes paid off Washington identified the dead man as a Carl Sinden he came in from Paris little over a month ago he was a scientist working around European atomic installations I'm on a report for the Atomic Energy Commission at least they'll be happy to know this fella sind ins contamination was not of local origin yeah but there's still a murder to consider that's for police our job is to find out how and where he got this radiation he could have gotten it before he entered this country well if that's true he could have contaminate to the other passengers on the plane that brought him in they could be in a bad way I know what's wrong with him right I'm gonna check it out went Dave it's a technical job better try to get that dr. Stephens to help good idea sure it is on Dave take her to dinner put it on your expense account will do hi alright if you're looking for someone I hope it's me I wait for dr. Stephen she's over there the one with the figure the brains and the crazy baby into Thanks dr. Stevens I presume hey what a delightful surprise I phoned the hospital they told me I'd find you here I always come here to my baseball nice to be with healthy yeah they don't look like they're suffering from malnutrition it's my night off how about some Dunning you sure know how to please the girl would you sit here and relax what I change I won't be a minute right come in go I hope you understand the delay but I had to be sure there is Elle Ryan's mind if I count it I'd be disappointed if you didn't tell me how does it feel to kill a man how does it feel to pay to have it done the same I suppose you know the man I hired you to kill was my friend but it didn't bother me so the other should be easy others thousand I wouldn't think you'd have that many friends if you're ready my man will take you to the airport you know that friend of yours was dying anyway what you need me for I didn't want him to talk that's the chart in his bed said he was radioactive all right take mr. Gupta the airport have a nice trip and thank you have you ever seen a more enchanting side many times Kariya most beautiful sight in the world is the bank of a flat top you're returning from a mission you wouldn't pilot still an Coast Guard Reserve I fly those choppers once or twice a month don't like fun it is what do you say we take a look at a even better view than this what instant that shadow Breann we ordered I thought you'd never mention it I'm starved salud oh we find out the man with the radiation was a foreign scientists who arrived in this country a month ago is it possible that he was already contaminated when landed oh no it could not have happened more than one day before he was found carpenter come on yes where right over at least find a body of a man who might be our hospital burger you mind coming along I wasn't hungry anyway what are we waiting for loop in it the NBI wants to check him out what is there to check out look at Freddie dr. Steven how do you do I need oh we're pretty sure it's your man Dave he's down there according to our ambulance doctor he is stabbed and then dumped in the water a couple of teenagers fooling around all their spotlights found him otherwise he might have been washed out with the tide any identification none whatever any ideas I'm not trying to hold out on you with Sanders at the moment I really don't know who he is anything a little fire engine he was exposed that's for sure could he have picked it up at the hospital possible I'll have a man who can give a positive identification down to the morgue in the morning I realize the element of murder makes this your case lieutenant but our emphasis national security so I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it as quiet as you can let us know every move you make we certainly will thanks I'm Pomeroy I have an appointment with dr. Becker yes sir dr. Becker is expecting this thank you I'd like to see dr. Paul Sybil I'm sorry dr. servos in seminar he can't be disturbed I'll wait Carlos Indian physicist graduated further in university 1946 received fellowship to Charles University in Prague 1948 was assigned to experimental physics at the University Oh record of his working in this country of young one here who might have been a child's university 48 the only name that comes to mind right off is dr. Paul servo I'd like to talk to him I'll get him ask dr. servo to come to my office please thank you you uh you say Carl sinden is dead murdered I see and you think dr. Sara Bell can help you find the mayor well we might be able to give us some information a lead it's worth a try Oh dr. servo yes there's a gentleman here who's been waiting to see you I can't see him now I was told to give you this when now is dr. Becker and you will kick dr. servo for me well did he say when he was coming back I can't understand going out you've gone far dr. servo I've been following your career with considerable interest in that case you should know a lot about me Oh everything for instance I know that you're an obscure scientist in Prague more than 10 years ago you were investigated and found to have the background the desirable attributes of the Patriot you were brought to this country given the finest of education the way was paved for you you were placed in the proper spots allowed to meet the right people and through these machinations you worked on some very important project this learning for yourself the name of being one of the foremost scientists in the United States I'm in an enviable position at the Institute I have free access to matters pertaining to as yet secret formulas that it well then it's sabotage as much at the Institute that can be destroyed no no doctor said Oh is there something much bigger something that will stagger your imagination it was to have been Carlson's project cinder yes I remember him it was an associate in Frank Alf Landen is dead contaminated with radioactivity how is that possible Sinan was a brilliant scientist he was also a brilliant drunk an alcoholic whose weakness was costly both to him and because the decision was made to have you complete the project dr. servo you are to assemble an atomic bomb in charge sir no please wait here he won't be with you in a moment hello Dave I don't we're all the reporters during here I don't know sir well crawled up the district a while back said he had a real important announcement late now what's the NBI his interest in this it's a long story coming ladies and gentlemen he's fine I want to thank you ladies and gentlemen for accepting my invitation I've just mailed my resignation to the Institute I want my reason to be known by everyone and I don't want to be misquoted what are your reasons doctor for years I've lived in the hope that nuclear reaction can be used only for its wonderful benefit but that is not to be each year we devise bigger and more terrible bomb I want no further part of a scientific body who are intelligent enough to harness the atom yet stupid enough to bring on world destruction this but isn't it true doctor that you were the one who advocated the larger h-bomb my interest in the h-bomb was solely an interest in its useful application that are nothing more today more nations have acquired the secret any one of them is capable of triggering world destruction I want no further part of that what are your future plans doctor are you giving up science altogether oh I take a rest a vacation perhaps then I might devote my time to some papers and the atoms usefulness its own to mankind that is if mankind is still with us you mean it's possible he might not be the next walk would answer that you expect the public to react favorably to your decision oh I'm sure that the opinions will be divided but the decision will be mine alone are there any other questions doctor I understand that you worked at Charles University in Prague around 1948 yes I did I wonder if you were acquainted with a dr. Karl Sinden there Sinden I know I don't seem to recall the name doctor sir though you mentioned the next war in your opinion when will it happen who knows one year 1020 but it will come it's inevitable unless we put a stop to this nuclear cancer but who would want to start it what nations would want to invite self-destruction any nation even the smallest you cannot give a child a gun even though he knows he will respect we will do it just the same and ladies and gentlemen we all are children solution doctor there is a solution for everything even there even this all we have to do is seek it but we are too busy ignoring it you have won the solution thank you very much doctor added girth all right except for one thing one of the reporters brought up the name of Karl Sinden well what about it well before I realized it I have denied knowing him it's on my record that he worked with me in Prague I checked further the circumstances I cannot be senior again not gonna contact you by telephone might be tapped that means a communication would be established the meanwhile just wait let's not leave the house if dr. Paul servo civilizations is on the way out unless the a bond be abolished completely thoroughly disgusted with the nuclear armament race dr. servo quit his job today at an interview dr. servo stated I was at that interview servo denied knowing Carl syndrome well it doesn't prove anything there's something else remember the woman who was at the hospital looking for a husband yeah what about it she was there too at the interview now in another room so so the killer had to know on what floor and what room Sinan was yeah you're right Dave it could be a connection let's put a 24-hour watch on servers house it's day and he hasn't left the house once about the woman she never came back no one else is going in neither the idea what he's doing it the best and whatever yeah take a look for

green olives eat in a certain savoir faire in the preparation if you ever decide to leave your x-ray machines try a restaurant can't miss oh I'm sorry about that but you know that if you pay your bills they won't disconnected hello yes he's here just a minute I should have told you gave your number fine thing my phone number in the NBI is little black book it's alright I told them we're

getting married all that well you just can't go around getting out a lady's phone number so I told them we're engaged you're not gonna make a wire around of course not whatever the cost we mustn't keep you honest exciting isn't it very we could have the lights on I could read yeah go ahead Pablo I suppose the garage you hello yes I'll go solo it just occurred to me that we forgot the wine you have to go back to the market yes sir I'll go right away it's a carburetor you're sure it's a long time mister now I know what carburetor when I see one this photo is of a crafter made carburetor what more cannot take I'm convinced thanks for your help there's one thing though it's a new model a new model yes that's right a new model I'll show you the old ones didn't have these things on where'd you get these photographs Dave I'd rather not say I'm afraid you'll have to if not to me then to the Atomic Energy Commission these are photographs of component W of the thermonuclear bomb I see this is a photograph of a sketch you had your office yesterday I want the sketch of the parts of me can't do it the man who brought in the job came back minutes later said he had some changes to make to the sketch you never returned any idea where he took it nothing you know who he is I never saw him before yesterday sorry I wish I could help I wish you could sue from he picked up the sketch after I photograph I guess the more men start from here fan out check every machine shop you can find there about a dozen photographs of the thing in here yeah three four to connect me with em one one moment 342 yes as the police pick up the Sunbeam sports car red California license wmo eight nine to have a date right also get a John Doe warrant posted to take over the observation post number one John Doe warrant observation post number one got it all right have it days chapter one yes sir what's he doing it's Benji's desk all morning let's pick him up I'll try on the back stay here where'd he come from the house how'd you get in the place was covered every minute are you sure that was servo that came back last night yes positive Freeman get up get it now you try upstairs you down here right where's dr. servo I have nothing to say what's your name I have nothing to say you're gonna have to talk sooner or later you may have a fractured skull call an ambulance right don't know stairs and then just what I'm gonna find out that's right an ambulance it best three five three Linden plate all right you're gonna answer some questions dare me in the basement were you followed not this time any more trouble how does it look we'll see in a minute your work here is finished you and Albert will now go to Chicago same operation you'll rent the house he'll set up the business front here are your tickets your luggage will be forwarded you've just time enough to make the plan what about the car leave it at the airport good job of machining see this orifice checks exactly right the others that is good we can proceed will it be difficult so far my thing has been difficult except the time I spent as an American citizen listen to this dr. servo you will be remembered as a great American your fears of world chaos express my own if only the other scientists took this stand it might convince the world of the terrible consequences of a nuclear war it's signed an American what's that all of that letters he got when his resignation at the news favors what you want to do with him well they probably don't mean anything but running through decoding anyway I'll trace a servo huh and somebody inside I'll show you where he is look at the machine gun I found the place where the carburetor was made but I got there five minutes after was picked up one through seven right Dave please pick up the trail of course car we're moving west on Jefferson you sadly on their way to the airport to catch a plane tickets to Chicago were found in their possession any identification lots of it probably all fictitious the boys are checking it out now that means only servo oh don't forget the carburetor it was picked up 55 minutes before the car wreck so we can assume that it was delivered and their assignment here is at an end does the same apply to civil oh I think he now has the carburetor and his assignment is just beginning possibly what does it add up to well it adds up to a scientist who has in his possession parts of what dr. Becker told me made up component W Koren W component W itself it's not important it's only important as part of a master assembly and assembly that gives off terrific radiation such as send and receive I know it sounds fantastic but I'm of the opinion that an atom bomb is being assembled in the city how could they possibly get everything necessary to assemble such a bomb must have taken a long time but they're shrewd and patient when they were ready they sent the scientists in to put it all together but something must have gone wrong if you'll recall we proved definitely that Senden was not radioactive when he came into this country come in excuse me we just decoded one of the letters we found in servos house or I just leave it you'd better read it sir project must be completed and ready to set off within 48 hours on delivery of CW we'll have you out of the house tonight follow plan 5c signed ap killing the civil defense authority that is our complete file beginning from the time we were called into this case by the AEC now it seems inconceivable that such an undertaking could go undetected much less be carried out to its conclusion yet all the facts point to this possibility well let's not be hasty with our decisions gentlemen maybe we're playing into their hands suppose there is no bomb suppose they just want us to believe there is one so they can create the st. terror panic it's the way they operate I for one do not believe they're going to set anything off here within 48 hours or 48 months but the facts definitely what Thanks guesses theories premises one missing scientist and a fancy carburetor do not add up to an atomic bomb there is no guess on my part I am certain the photograph I was shown was of component w a functional part of the nuclear thermal bomb does that prove that what is being assembled mr. mayor yes mr. Elliot well I can only speak for myself we at the AEC feel that the situation is a great one and recommend that the city be evacuated well if the governor agrees and declares of the state of emergency exists how long would it take to evacuate the city my calculations 24 hours but it would take 15 to 20 hours to prepare for it the mayor suggested during that time the Bureau be allowed to make an all-out effort to look at the bond you have a plan mr. Pomeroy yes sir I have now we know that the carburetor was picked up at the machine shop here at 12:55 the man who picked it up was spotted driving in a car with a woman passenger about 150 here at the corner of Jefferson and Vermont I've computed the distance between these two points it's four miles the machinist said the man was alone when he picked up the carburetor allowing for the time it took for him to deliver it and pick up his woman passenger I figured it was impossible for him to have gone beyond the radius of this area but how could you check out such a large area by going from door to door wouldn't that arouse public suspicion with the cooperation of the telephone company we intend to go in as company troubleshooter Oh trust you requested the assistance of a scientist we sent you calendar within a few weeks the man is dead now you take it upon yourself without permission to remove servo from a most strategic position is my loyalty being questioned that will only be answered when you explained your request for this meeting now you know the code forbids direct contact between agents and a member of headquarters but this was too big to put in a report I wanted to see you besides I thought you might leader the project you're opposed to the rather vague about this project what would you say mr. Steadman if I told you that I have achieved the impossible that I have assembled a nuclear bomb right here in this city I'd say were insane a man is insane when his work is based on delusion but when his work is based on an actual fact come here I'll show you Hey in the basement of a house on this street is the bomb the basement is insulated it could stay there indefinitely until we need it Chicago New York Washington we plant a bomb in every big city and when the day comes while they radar scanning the skies raaah ballistic missiles we trigger these to go off simultaneously the element of surprise is complete and will once oh we can emanate all opposition tell me tell me you ordered to do this no no one knew about it I wasn't even sure it would succeed the first one took a long time now the organization must take over and since I'm the only one that knows how this can be accomplished you must put me in charge of the entire project please consider yourself under arrest you will be returned it will be decided what has to be done with you I was a fool I thought that you will agree no now I see that you're jealous you knew that I would get a claim an approbation and you don't want me to have that with that gun you cannot stop me nobody can stop me I like to check your phone man it's probably on the line Oh you we're Steadman Denis come oh you see I'm to call him when it's ready it's ready now can it be set off before this is attached what is it part of the trigger attach it it should only be done at the time when Stefan wants to see it completed ready to be triggered it's too dangerous what doctor should I tell him that you refused to continue must we bring someone else to finish all right right in a few minutes finish it's ready to go off yes when this firing pin is inserted to trigger it let me have it let me I'll give it to no one but Stedman she's responsibility very well you can column is at my place the number is Crestview four two eight three nine buddy knits a lot why did it go up my trigger this why did he go up I said I wanted to go up well the fishness begun wait higher writer it will it will go off I tell you you have to name that nobody can prevent Institute of Technology dr. Becker specialize in Pomeroy please hurry this is emergency yes I found it it's been triggered but it hasn't gone off is that possible to not happen yes it can but it's only a postponement the delayed explosion well how about a demolition squad can they do anything not a chance things like this happen in the Pacific a few years ago even then it exploded an hour later well we're lucky because Dave your party is hanging up dr. Becker well try and trace the call in the meantime get me the NBI all right dr. fector you keep on trying hold on this may be him now hello yesterday dr. Becker told me where are you I'm in the basement of a house in the middle of the 2700 block on Sycamore I'll send the demolition squad no no no no that that won't help I listen to me I've got a plan had the Coast Guard set a helicopter down in the middle of the block have the pilot leave I'll fly it I haven't got time to explain stay by the shortwave I'll contact I want you to ring every house on the 2700 block on Sycamore and let me know the results we keep bringing those numbers attention attention this is your Police Department please remain in your home we're going to land a helicopter down here please remain in your home I repeat we're going to land a helicopter down here please remain in your home hey Dave shall we come down there no stay back and don't let anybody through please repaid dr. Smith hello hello Paula you are two hours late how about a registration count of 700 Rangers is there a chance did you did you find another body this one's alive not for long without radiation count he's as good as dead babe are you there they buy your name so long doc you why don't we hear are you sure that thing is working one this is Coast Guard one four zero zero come in this come in Dave over m1 should be safe three countless mm one calling Coast Guard one four zero zero come in Dave over m 1 calling Coast Guard one four zero zero come in Dave come in Dave Dave come in Dave and this is Coast Guard. One four zero zero. yes sir it's all over a state of emergency no sir that won't be necessary (Dramatic Music)
