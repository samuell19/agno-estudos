Oh, that one. That's my grandfather. - Your grandfather? - Yeah. - That's not your grandfather. - It is, you know. But I've seen your grandfather. He lives in your house. Oh, that's my other grandfather, but he's my grandfather as well. How do you reckon that one out? Well, everyone's entitled to two, aren't they? And this is my other one. We know that, but what's he doing here? Well, my mother thought the trip would do him good. - How's that? - He's nursing a broken heart. Ah, poor old thing. Hey, mister, are you nursing a broken heart? He's a nice old man, isn't he? He's very clean. - Hello, grandfather. - Hello. He can talk then, can he? Of course he can talk. He's a human being, isn't he? Well, if he's your grandfather, who knows? Ha ha ha. And we're looking after him, are we? - I look after myself. - Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. He's got you worried, then? Him, he's a villain, a real mixer... and he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. - Get on. - No, straight up. Hiya. - Hello, Shake. - Hello, Shake. - You got on all right, then? - No. Oh? Well, we're here. Norm'll be along in a minute with the tickets. Hey, who's the little old man? It's Paul's grandfather. - Oh, aye, but I thought... - No, that's his other one. Oh, that's all right, then. Clean, though, isn't he? Oh, aye. He's very clean. - Morning, lads. - Hi, Norm. Thank God you've all got here. Look, I've had a marvellous idea. Just for once, let's all try to behave... like ordinary respectable citizens. Let's not cause any trouble, pull any strokes... or do anything I'm gonna be sorry for... especially tomorrow in that television theatre, because... Are you listening to me, Lennon? You're a swine. Isn't he, George? Yeah, a swine. Thanks. Hey. Who's that little old man? - Well, who is he? - He belongs to Paul. Oh, well. I'm going down for a cup of coffee. - Anyone coming? - We'll follow you down. I want me coffee. You can come with Shake and me, if you like. Look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him. Don't be cheeky. I'll bind him to me with promises. Very clean, isn't he? Come out, grandad. Make up your mind, will you? Hello. Morning. All right? Whoa. Do you mind if we have it open? Yes, I do. Well, there are four of us, and we'd like it open... not if it's all the same to you, that is. It isn't. I travel on this train regularly... twice a week, so I suppose I have some rights. So have we. And we'll have that thing off as well. Thank you. But... An elementary knowledge of the Railway Acts... would tell you that I am perfectly within my rights. Yeah, but we want to hear it. There's more of us than you. We're a community, a majority vote. Up the workers and all that stuff. Then I suggest you take that damn thing... into the corridor, or some other part of the train... where you obviously belong. Give us a kiss. Look, mister, we paid for our seats, too, you know. I travel on this train regularly, twice a week. Knock it off, Paul. You can't win with his sort. After all, it's his train, isn't it, mister? And don't take that tone with me, young man. I fought the war for your sort. I bet you're sorry you won. - I shall call the guard. - Ah, but what? They don't take kindly to insults, you know. Let's go have some coffee and leave the kennel to Lassie. Hey, mister, can we have our ball back? Look, mister. Mister. Can we have our ball back? - Hey. - Please, mister. - You want to watch it. - Well, it's not my fault. You stick to that story, son. I can't help it. I'm just taller than you are. They always say that. Well, I've got me eye on ya. I'm sorry, Norm. I can't help being taller than you. Well, don't rub it in. I've a good mind to thump you, Shake. If you're gonna have a barney, can I hold your coat? - He started it. - I did not. You did. Well, what happened? The old fella said that... could he have these pictures, and Norm said, "No." And all I said was, "Well, why not be big about it?" - And? - Your grandfather pointed out... that Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me. I knew it. He started it. - I should've known. - You what? You two have never had an argument in your life... and in two minutes flat, he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. He hates group unity, so he gets everyone at it. Well, I suggest you just give him the photos... and have done with it. Oh, all right, you old devil. Here you are. Hey, Pauly, would you ever sign one of them for us? Ah, come out, Shake. - Hey, look at the talent. - Let's give them a pull. - Should I? - Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff. - What's that supposed to mean? - I don't know. I thought it just sounded distinguished-like. George Harrison, the scouse of distinction. Excuse me, madame. Excuse me, but these young men I'm sitting with... wondered if two of us could come over and join you. I'd ask you myself, only I'm shy. I'm sorry, miss. You mustn't fraternise with me prisoners. - Prisoners? - Convicts in transit. Typical old lags, the lot of them. You what? Get out, ladies. Get out while you can. He's been gone a long time. - Who? - Paul's grandfather. Oh, I didn't notice. Where'd he go? - Down the... - Oh, down the... Yeah, down the... Oh, well, give him a couple of minutes, then. Hey, have you seen Paul's grandfather? Of course. He's concealed about me person. Now, he must've slipped off somewhere. - Have you lost him? - Now, don't exaggerate. You've lost him. Look, put it this way, Pauly... he's mislaid him. Honest, you can't trust you with anything, Norm. If you've lost him, I'll cripple ya. - He can't have got far. - Let's look up the sharp end. What's the matter with you, then? It's his grandfather. I can tell he doesn't like me. It's because I'm little. You've got an inferiority complex, you have. Yeah, I know. That's why I play the drums. It's me active compensatory factor. Going in, then? No, she'll only reject me in the end... and I'll be frustrated. You never know. You may be lucky this time. No, I know the psychological pattern. It plays havoc with me drum skins. Excuse me. Have you seen that little old man we were with? We've broken out... the blessed freedom of it all. Have you got a nail file? These handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I'm innocent. I don't want to go. Sorry for disturbing you, girls. I bet you can't guess what I was in for. Should we go in here? No, it's probably a honeymoon couple... or a company director or something. Well, I don't care. I'm gonna broaden my outlook. Congratulate me, boys. I'm engaged. Oh, no, you're not. Not this time. And to think me own grandson... would've let them put me behind bars. Don't dramatise. Let's face it, you're lucky to be here. If they'd have had their own way... you would have been dropped off already. Well, you've got to admit you upset a lot of people. At least I can keep my eye on you... while you're stuck in here. Shove up. - Odds or evens? - Odds. Don't worry, son. We'll get you the best lawyer green stamps can buy. Oh. It's a laugh a line with Lennon. Anyway, it's your fault. - Why me? - Why not you? God, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny. They usually reckon dogs more than people in England. You'd expect something more palatial. - Let's do something, then. - Like what? Ok. Cor, there's the girls. I'll deal them. Aye aye, the Liverpool shuffle. Two for you, two for me, three for them.

He's right, you know. There you go. Hey... Hey, what's all this? Oh, him. He's been lurking. He looks a right lurker, doesn't he? You're undressed. Where are your clothes? The old gentleman. He borrowed them to go gambling at Le Cirque. He's gone to my club, has he? - Yeah. It's all your fault. - What? Getting invites to gambling clubs and all that.

Do you mean Lord McCartney? Oh, he's at it again. Look, I'm his grandfather. I mean... Oh, it must be the dolly floor show. Put me down. Who are these ruffians? I never saw them before. Before you go, gentlemen... there's a little matter of the bill. I'll take care of that. A hundred and eighty pounds? I beg your pardon... guineas. Your winnings, my lord... £190. Ha. - What about me change? - Cloak room charge. Ah, well, easy come, easy go. Well? Guten morgen, mein Herr. [Speaking German] Ah, ze filthy Englander. Guten morgen. Keep Britain tidy. - Aw, go on, George. - Don't be ridiculous. But you said I could. Honestly, me mind boggles at the very idea. A grown man, and you haven't shaved with a safety razor. It's not my fault. I come from a long line of electricians. Well, you're not practising on me. All right, then. But show us. Oh, come on, then. Hee hee ho. Ooh. ♪ Rule, Britannia, Britannia rules the ♪ Put your tongue away. It looks disgusting... hanging there all pink and naked. - One slip of the razor, and... - Ooh. Help. Ich. Headphones. Help me.

John? John? John? What are you messing around with that boat for? There's a car waiting. Come on. Ready, John? As soon as we draw up... open that door and straight in. We can't keep them waiting much longer. - I knew they'd be late. - Oh, here they are. - Boys, come on. - Where have you been? It's your press conference we're arranging. All right. Give us a couple of shakes... to get our breath, will you? Hey, I've got a suit just like him, you know. Ringo. Yeah. I don't like the handkerchief. I always have the handkerchief in me trouser pocket. You can't blow your nose on it up there, can you, mister? No, you can't. How about highbrow music? I've always liked that question. I never noted his nose till about six months ago. And me mother asked me before we left for America... if we wanted any sandwiches. And when I plugged her in, she just blew up. Tell me... how did you find America? Turn left at Greenland. - Has success changed your life? - Yes. I'd like to keep Britain tidy. - Are you a mod or a rocker? - No, I'm a mocker. Oh. Have you any hobbies? No. Actually, we're just good friends. Do you think these haircuts have come to stay? Well, this one has, you know. It's stuck on good and proper now. Frightfully nice. What would you call that hairstyle you're wearing? Arthur. No. Actually, we're just good friends. No, they're brown, aren't they? What do you call that collar? - Oh. A collar. - Oh. Do you often see your father? No. Actually, we're just good friends. How do you like your girlfriends to dress? Ha ha. - What a drag that was. - I'm starving. Didn't even get a jam butty, did you? Anything left? We've just finished, Pauly. Hey, George, give us your John Henry on that picture. Hey, look at that. Is that our set down there? - Shall we go down, have a go? - Yeah. - Trees and everything. - A lot of fellas for one set. Look, it's a bird. Just passing through, like. - Where are they? - On the stage, down here. Leave them drums alone. Oh, surely I could just have a little touch. You so much as breathe heavy on them... and I'm out on strike. Aren't you being rather arbitrary? There you go, hiding behind a smoke screen... of bourgeois cliches. I don't go messing about with your earphones, do I? - Spoilsport. - Well? He's very fussy about his drums, you know. They loom large in his legend. - What's up? - Oh, he's sulking again. Ha ha ha.

Let's hear no more about it. You're probably right. Now, look... if you think I'm unsuitable, let's have it out in the open. I can't stand these backstage politics. Aren't you tending to black and white the situation somewhat? Well, quite honestly, I wasn't expecting a musical arranger... to question my ability picture-wise. I could listen to him for hours. What's all this about a musical arranger? Mr McCartney Senior. Hey, Paulie, they're trying to fob you off... with this musical charlatan, but I gave him the test. I'm quite happy to be replaced. He's a typical buck-passer. - I won an award. - A likely story. It's on the wall in my office. Hello, our lot. Everybody happy? All right, all right. If you don't need them... I'll lock them up in the dressing room. Please do. I'll not need them for half an hour. Thank you. Get me a bottle of milk and some tranquillisers. I see it all now. It's a plot... a plot. Tranquillisers. Come back, you lot. I've got the key. Come back, Ringo. - Hello. - Come on. Leslie Jackson? I saw your father... in the old empire in nineteen hundred and nine. Ah, if you're as good as him, son, you're all right. Gear costume. - Swap? - Cheeky. Come, lads. First door, and no messing about. Lennon, put them girls down, or I'll tell your mother of you. And stop messing about. Stay in here until that rehearsal. I'm going to keep you in, even if I have to put... the lock in the key and turn it. We're out.

Sorry we hurt your field, mister. Not here. Hello, Dicky. Probably gone to the canteen... cup of tea, like. No, that's too easy for Lennon. He's out there somewhere... causing trouble just to upset me. You're imagining it, Norm. You're letting it prey on your mind. No. This is a battle of nerves between John and me. But John hasn't got any. - What? - Nerves. No. That's just the trouble. I've toyed with the idea of a ball and chain... but he'd just rattle them at me... and in public, too. Sometimes I think he enjoys seeing me suffer. - Hello. - Hello. - Wait a minute. Don't tell me... - No, I'm not. - Oh, you are. - I'm not. - Oh, you are. I know you are. - I'm not. No. - You look just like him. - Do I? You're the first one that's said that ever. Yes, you do. Look. - No. Me eyes are lighter. - Excuse me. All right, noddy. - Oh, yes. Your nose is, very. - Me nose. - Is it? - Well, I would've said so. Oh, you know him better, though. I do not. He's only a casual acquaintance. - That's what you say. - What have you heard? - It's all over the place. - Is it? Is it really? But I wouldn't have it. I stuck up for you. - I knew I could rely on you. - Thanks. You don't look like him at all. She looks more like him than I do. There will be a full rehearsal... in ten minutes time. Ten minutes from now, a full rehearsal. Oh, there you are. Oh, sorry. Must've made a mistake. No, you haven't. You're just late. I am? Actually, I think he'll be very pleased with you. Will he? Yes. You're quite a feather in the cap. Hello? I've got one. Oh, I think so. Yes, he can talk. Well, I think you ought to see him. Yes. All right. Come on. Sorry. You don't see many of these nowadays, do you? Come on. Simon, will this do? Oh, not bad, Dolly... not really bad. Turn around, chickie baby. Oh, yes, he's a definite poss. He'll look good alongside Susan. All right, Sonny Jim, this is all going to be quite painless. Don't breathe on me, Adrian. I'm terribly sorry... but there seems to be some sort of misunderstanding. Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop... and carry on for our benefit. I'm afraid I don't understand. Oh, my God. He's a natural. Well, I did tell them not to send us real ones. They ought to know the phonies are much easier to handle. Still, he's a good type. We'd like you to give us your opinion... on some clothes for teenagers. Oh, by all means. I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality. Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out, and you'll learn it. - Can he read? - Of course I can. I mean lines, ducky. Can you handle lines? - Well, I'll have a bash. - Good. Give him whatever it is they drink. A coke-a-Rama? Ta. Well, at least he's polite. Show him the shirts, Adrian. Now, you'll like these. You'll really dig them. They're fab and all the other pimply hyperboles. I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty. - Grotty? - Yeah, grotesque. Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. It's rather touching, really. Here's this kid... trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion... when I know for a fact that within a month... he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex... and loss of status... because he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit. That's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want. I won't. You can be replaced, chickie baby. I don't care. And that pose is out, too, Sonny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately and be right wing. Anyway, if you don't cooperate, you won't meet Susan. And who's this Susan when she's at home? Only Susan Campy our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol. Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong? I beg your pardon. Oh, yeah, the lads frequently sit round the television... and watch her for a giggle. In fact, once we all sat down and wrote these letters... saying how gear she was and all that rubbish. She's a trendsetter. It's her profession. She's a drag... a well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things. - Get him out of here. - Have I said something amiss? Get him out. He's knocking the program's image. - Sorry about the shirts. - Get him out. You don't think he's a new phenomenon, do you? You mean an early clue to the new direction? Where's the calendar? Oh, no, no, no. It's all right. He's just a troublemaker. The change isn't due for three weeks yet. All the same, make a note not to extend Susan's contract. And let's not take any unnecessary chances? [Singing in German] So I explained to my mother that he was a very clean man. She was quite pleased. [Chorus singing in German] - There's no one here. - No one here? Well, where have they gone? That's wrong, isn't it? Surely, that's wrong. No, not you. Get him out. There's someone coming. Quick, hide. Stop being taller than me. It's not my fault... Ha ha ha ha. - What are you doing here? - Hiding. You must be soft or something. Well, we weren't hiding. We were resting. I thought I told you lot to stop here. Well? When I say stay put, I mean stay put. Don't cane me, sir. I was led astray. Oh, shut up, John. They're waiting for you in the studio. Gear. I'm dying to do a bit of work. Well, God bless you, Ringo. - Oh, listen to teacher's pet. - Crawler. - Betrayed the class? - Aw, lay off. - Temper, temper. - Well? Will you get a move on? They're waiting for you. Sorry. I now declare this bridge open. Where are they? Where are they? Where are they? They're coming. They're coming, I promise you. Ah, yes, well... if they aren't on this floor in thirty seconds... there'll be trouble, understand me? Trouble. Standing about? Some people have it dead easy. Once you're over thirty, you're past it. It's a young man's medium. I just can't stand the pace. - Oh, you're as young as that? - I was. Ah, there he goes. Look at him. I bet his wife doesn't know about her. He hasn't even got a wife. Look at his sweater. You never know. She might've knitted it. She's knitted him. Right. Standby. Run through a number... and try not to jiggle out of position. Hello, three? Coming to you. Three. Three, coming to you. Three. - We're on three. - What? - We're on three. - Oh, yes.

Very nice. Make-up? No, not really. They don't need any. They'll just powder them off for the shine. Oh, well, yes. Norm, would you take them down to make-up... and powder them off... the shine. Sure. You blinked. - Come on. Come in. - Hello, lads. Hey, your grandfather's not talking to me. I think he's got a sulk on. It must be catching on. He's given it to Ringo here. Stop picking on him, George. I don't need you to protect me, you know, Norm. Got a touch of the swine fever, haven't you? - No. Come on, lads. Sit down. - This is impossible. - We'll never get them all done. - Then do us first. It doesn't matter to them whether they're made up or not. By the way, what's that? My name's Betty. Do you want a punch up your frogged tunic? No. John, behave yourself, or I'll murder you. Shake, take that wig off. It suits you. - Ringo, what are you up to? - Page five. You always fancied yourself as a guardsman, didn't you? Oh, that this too, too solid flesh would melt. Zap. Hey, you won't interfere with the basic rugged concept... of me personality, will you, madam? Hey, he's reading the Queen. That's an in-joke, you know. Shazam. It's my considered opinion that you're a bunch of sissies. - You're just jealous. - Leave him alone, Lennon... or I'll tell them all the truth about you. - You wouldn't. - Oh, I would, though. I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery... and so far, I've been in a train and a room... and a car and a room and a room and a room. Well, maybe that's all right... for a bunch of powdered geegaws like you lot... but I'm feeling decidedly straight-jacketed. What a clean old man. Ah, don't press your luck. He's sex obsessed. The older generation are leading this country... to galloping ruin. What's a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this? They're nearly ready for you. Just finishing the band call. I say, did you go to Harrods? I was there in '58, you know. - I can get you on the stage. - Oh, how? You turn right here at the corridor... and go past the fireplace. Ah, I don't like yours. Hey, kids, I got an idea. Well, why don't we do the show right here? Yeah.

Very good, that, George. - Oh. - Oh. Well, we're trying. Yeah, keep trying. Let's go. Come on. That was great, lads. Now, you've got about an hour, but don't leave the theatre. Where are you going, John? She's going to show me her stamp collection. So's mine. John, I'm talking to you. This final run-through is important, understand? Important. - I want a cup of tea. - Shake? I've got to adjust the decibels on the inbalance, Norm. Clever. George? Ringo, look after him, will you? - Oh, hey, Norm. - Do I have to raise my voice? All right. Come on, grandad. I'm a drummer, not a wet nurse, you know. Would you look at him... sitting there with his hooter scraping away at that book. Well, what's the matter with that? Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that? - You can learn from books. - You can, can you? Sheeps' heads. You could learn more by getting out there and living. - Out where? - Any old where. But not our little Richard. Oh, no. When you're not thumping them pagan skins... you're tormenting your eyes with that rubbish. - Books are good. - Parading's better. Parading? Parading the streets... trailing your coat, bowling along... living. - Well, I am living. - You? Living? When was the last time you gave a girl... a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a Sheila... with your cool appraising stare? You're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you? Well, at least I've got a backlog of memories. All you've got is that book. Ah, stop picking on me. You're as bad as the rest of them. Ah, so you are a man after all. What's that mean? Do you think I haven't noticed? Do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? You poor, unfortunate scruff. They've driven you into books... with their cruel, unnatural treatment... exploiting your good nature. I don't know. Ah, that lot's never happier unless they're jeering you. And where would they be... without the steady support of your drum beat? That's what I'd like to know. Yeah. That's right. And what's it all come to in the end? Yeah. What's in it for me? A book. Yeah, a blooming book. When you could be out there... betraying a rich American widow... or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. Yeah, funny, really, because I never thought... but being middle-aged and old... takes up most of your time, doesn't it? You're only right. Where are you going? I'm going parading before it's too late. Hey, Ringo, you know what just happened to me? No, I don't. You ought to stop looking so scornful. It's twisting your face. Tell him of the story about... Hello, here he is, the middle-aged boy wonder. I thought you were looking after the old man. We've only got half an hour to the final run-through. He can't walk out on us now. Can't he? He's done it, son. - Hey, you know what happened? - We know. Your grandfather. He's stirred him up. He hasn't. Yeah, he... he filled his head with notions seemingly. The old mixer. Come on, we'll have to put him right. Coming up, all dancers onstage for rehearsal, please. Split up and look for him. We've become a limited company. I'll look in here again. - Hello there. - Get out of it, shorty. Hey, you should have more sense... than to go around chucking bricks about. Southerner. Here, mate. That's my hoop. Stop playing with it. Hoop? That isn't a hoop. It's a lethal weapon. - Have you got a licence for it? - Oh, don't be so stroppy. Well, a boy your age rolling hoops at people. - How old are you, anyway? - Eleven. - I bet you're only 10 1/2. - 10 2/3. There you are, then, and don't be rolling at people. Oh, you can have it. I'm packing it in. It depresses me. - You what? - You heard. It gets on my wick. That's lovely talk, that is. And why aren't you at school? - I'm a deserter. - Are you now? - Yeah, I've blown school out. - Just you? No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon, and Ding Dong. - Oh, Ding Dong bell? - Yeah, that's right. They was supposed to come with us, but they chickened. Yeah? And they're your mates, are they? Yeah. Not much cop without them, is it? - Oh, it's all right. - Yeah? What are they like? Ginger's mad. He says things all the time. And Eddy's good at spitting and punching. Yeah? How about Ding Dong? Oh, he's a big head. He fancies himself, you know. He's all right, though, because he's one of the gang. - Why aren't you at work? - I'm a deserter, too. - Oh. - Hey, Charlie. See ya. Come in, number seven. Your time's up. I'm sorry, boys. I didn't mean it, honest. If he says that again, I'll strike him. Oh, don't worry. They're good lads. They'll be back. Well, we've only twenty minutes to the final run-through. I meant no harm. I was only trying to encourage little Ringo to enjoy himself. God knows what you've unleashed on the unsuspecting south. It'll be wine, women, and song all the way with Ringo... when he gets the taste for it. That was fresh this morning. Two and nine. - Right. On your way. - You what? You heard. On your way. Troublemaker. Hey, watch it. - Shake. - What? Worry, will you? Well, that's it. Two minutes to the final run-through. - They're bound to miss it now. - I'll murder that Lennon. We could survive a missed run-through as long as they... As long as they end up for the show? Oh, you're right there. I mean, it wouldn't do... to miss the show, like, would it? Shut up, cheerful. You don't think... Oh, oh, oh no. - Now, look, don't worry. - They can't do this to me, no. It's all your fault. Oh, yes, it is. If they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes... For all the tea in China. Oh, you're right there. Neither would it. - You dirty traitor. - Well, of course. Yes, of course. ♪ I have been working like a dog ♪ - Hello. - Hi, John. John. - Did you want something? - I could eat the lot of you. You'd look great with an apple in your gob. Do you realise you could have missed the final run-through? Oh, we're sorry about that. Norm? There's only three of them. Oh, we were looking for Ringo... but we realised he must've come back here. Well, do you realise that we are on the air live... in front of an audience in forty-five minutes... and you're one short? Control yourself, or you'll spurt. He must be here somewhere. Aye, well, we'll look in the dressing room. - Shake. - Yes, the dressing room. Hey, where's my grandfather? Don't worry about him, Paul. He can look after himself. I suppose so. Personally signed and handwritten... by your own sweet boys. The chance of a lifetime. Be the envy of your less fortunate sisters. Oh, me bones. All right, break it up. Break it up. Move on. Hey, what's going on here? Right, move over. Move over. - Come on, move along. - Here you are. Why don't you go back home? You're making a disturbance. Will you just move along now? Come on, ya. Yeah. Thank you. Gotcha. You nasty little person, you. Come on. Ooh, yeah. I'm Ringo Starr. I've got a show to do. I'm on in a few minutes. You've got to let me go. I'm Ringo. Yeah, that's what they all say these days. Look, I don't care who you are. You can save that for the stipendiary. - Here you are, sarge. - All right. What is he? Yeah, I got a little list here. Wandering abroad, malicious intent... acting in a suspicious manner... conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it. Oh, a little savage, is he? Yeah, a proper little aborigine. - I demand to see my solicitor. - What's his name? Well, if you're gonna get technical about it. Dragging me through the streets... Hello, it's gonna be one of those nights, is it? Sit Charlie Peace down over there, will you? Well, you got me here, so do your worst... but, by God, I'll take one of you with me. - Ow. - I know your game. Get me into that tiled room and then out come the rubber hoses. Oh, there's a fire, is there? You ugly great brute. You have sadism... stamped all over your bloated British kisser. I'll go on hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle tap. What's he on about? I'm a soldier of the republic. You'll need the mahogany truncheon on this boyo. ♪ A nation once again ♪ ♪ A nation once again ♪ Get Lloyd George over there... next to the mechanic in the cloth cap... while I sort this lot out, will you? Come on, dad. Sit down over here. Ringo, me old scout. So they grabbed your leg for the iron, too, have they? I'm not exactly a voluntary patient. Have they roughed you up yet? What? Oh, they're a desperate crew of drippings... and they've fists like matured hams... for pounding poor defenceless lads like you. Right, that's it, then. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. - Hold on. I'll be back for you. - For me? If they get you on the floor, watch out for your brisket. They seem all right to me. Ah, sure, that's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains. Would you two like a cup of tea? See? Sly villains. No, thank you, Mr Sergeant, sir. No, not for me. Please don't. So you just brought the old chap... out of the crowd for his own good? Well, he was getting a bit nasty, you see... so we had to bring him in. Well, he can't stop here. This is the stuff he's been hawking around? - Yes, sergeant... photographs. - Photographs. Well, son, it's now or never. All right, you paid assassins. Johnny McCartney... will give you a run for your thruppence halfpenny. Hey, you forgot your photographs. Only half an hour, and you're on. - Can I say something? - Yes. Anything. It seems highly unlikely we'll be on. I mean, the law of averages are against it. I think if you could get the juggler on... with a couple more clubs... that would fill in a bit of time. Come on, let's go. I'll have the hides off you lot. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go home. I must see Pauly. Go home, then, and see him on the telly. - Can you fix him for me? - Yeah. Sixpence. - Each. - In advance. Mercenaries. It's all right. Leave him alone. What's up, Richard? Paul? Where are you? I'm... Grandad. Where's Ringo? The police have the poor lad in the Bridewell. - The police station. - He'll be pulp by now. - Go get him. - We'll get him out. We'll fix it, Norm.

If you hadn't come back, it would have meant... the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life. Hey, aren't you supposed to be in that box? - Yeah, where's the old mixer? - Here, Pauly. Got a few words to say to you, two-faced John McCartney. Aw, leave him alone. He's back, isn't he? - It's not his fault he's old. - What's old got to do with it? He's a troublemaker and a mixer. That's good enough for me. You're right. He's only asking for attention, aren't you? You see, you know your trouble. You should've gone west to America. You would've been a senior citizen of Boston.
