I'm home. Hello? Did you have a good day? No. - You did grocery shopping? - No. So, there's no... No! Call in and let us know. Maybe you're a fascist pig or a tree hugger. I don't care. I just want to hear... ...reports are now flooding in from all over the country, as well as from all over the world. A lot of false information has been spread on social media. So we urge you to check the official channels for the latest updated information. Come on, it's just some big pharmaceutical company trying to cash in. They probably created the virus in order to push their vaccine on us. Do you reckon? The rate it's spreading is alarming and health officials are now urging the public to stay at home until further official news... Anyway. Look, I've got loads of papers to mark. Then, I should go to bed. Hey, I... I want to... You want to...? Never mind, we'll talk about it tomorrow when you get home. Okey-dokey. - What the fuck did you do?! - Wait here! Hey, I want to... I want to... ...get a divorce. I guess it was just a matter of time. I'm sorry, what? Hello? Ever heard about 9/11? Run! They're... ...biting! What do you mean, biting?! Oh, my God! The BBC is now reporting that those infected are extremely dangerous and should be avoided at all costs. Until further notice, food rationing is advised. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has just tweeted that... One, two, three, four... cans of chopped tomatoes, two baked beans and some Tabasco. That's it? Oh, and... and some ketchup. I can't do this. Oh, God... Are you okay? That list is not gonna last us more than a couple of days, tops! I have an idea. I really don't want to do this. You said so yourself. Our supplies won't last us more than a couple of days. And if the door to the building is locked, then you should probably be okay out in the hallway. "Probably?" You do realize that looting our neighbours' homes... is kind of illegal? Honestly, I really don't think they'll give a shit anymore. You saw what happened out there. Jesus! Their faces were all gone! Look, we'll take it in turns. Okay? And you didn't hear anyone? - No. The door to the Andersons' was open. Put Xs in your windows, and wait for help... Oh... Okay. You should check their place out too. Oddjob. Okay. There are some... moving boxes in the wardrobe. You should get those out so that... we can store our stuff in them. See you later. You should see her clothes. Were you planning on leaving me? I was just wondering, just because of the... Well, the moving boxes were... Or perhaps you got them for that stuff we put in storage? Yeah. - Okay. - Your turn. I really don't wanna do this. I couldn't help noticing the Andersons have a... They have a bigger TV than us. Forty-inch, I think. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - Oh, good... ...North European refugees. This is our last broadcast for now. We'll be back as soon as the situation has stabilized. Until then, you are all urged to stay indoors, and avoid physical contact with others. Rescue teams are out evacuating people. Put an X in your windows so these rescue workers can find you. Tune in to radio FM 1.03.2 at 3 PM for the latest updates. We repeat, put an X in your windows so that rescue teams can find you. - Good morning. - What the fuck?! I couldn't sleep, so I went out to get some stuff. - You went to get some stuff?! - And we don't know how long we're gonna be cooped up here, do we, so... Might as well stock up, just in case. I mean, hopefully we'll be rescued soon. But better safe than sorry, right? At which point we'll return the things we've taken, right? Of course. Oh... You're kidding? I know! It's crazy. But she looks fatter, right? We could go to St Paul's. I bet people are seeking refuge there. You're joking, right? You heard what they said. Stay indoors, wait for help. Seems pretty clear to me. Yeah, but what if they... the... the infected people... what if they try to get in? We'll defend ourselves. We still don't know the cause behind the epidemic, why only certain parts of the world are affected, or why those who are infected act the way they do. All we can do is urge everyone to please stay indoors. We know there are a lot of you out there, and we're doing everything in our power to keep water and electricity going as best we can. In return, all I'm asking of you is that you keep yourselves busy while you wait for help, because help is on the way. Thank you. That was the Department of Health's chief scientific... "Keep busy." What the fuck's that supposed to mean? Kill time while we wait for help? How? Doing what? It's going to be okay. Soon all of this will be over and... everything will return back to normal. Normal... Some of our neighbours are lying... half-eaten, by my bike out there. And there's a bunch of infected fuckers running around trying to bite our faces off. What "normal" are you talking about?! if we look at history, what it teaches us is that at every, shall we say, momentous event, people have shown a remarkable ability to recover and... if we take the... the Black Death and even world wars and... Is this what you teach your students? That everything will probably be okay? - Where are you going? - Wine. Oh, hang on, hang on. Please, just... Really? This early? I've been drinking wine every single day for a year almost. Ever since she... What do you think my "magazine expense" is? Haven't you noticed I've been reading the same goddamn magazines over and over again?! That was when we died, wasn't it? The thing I wanted more than anything else in this life, I can't have anymore. I didn't see myself in her. But I did see you. So looking at you every day... it hurts. People throw pity parties for us to make themselves feel better about their own relationships. "Hey, as long as we haven't got it as bad as them." I know. We're the sad couple. I don't give a shit what they think. I just... I just wanted to see her grow. My baby girl. - Me too. And pretty soon, we'll be gone too. No. No. We're gonna get through this. - Do you actually believe that? - I know it. I actually know it. And if... one of them tries to break in, we'll be fucking ready. Yeah. Come on, practice makes perfect. Come on! Shh! Someone's at the door. You reckon it's the rescue team? Fuck off! Fuck! Fuck's sake! - Tea. - Coffee. Professor Olpes says it should be relatively easy to isolate the virus and find a vaccine. We'll be back with more news at 12 o'clock. I can really kill for a smoke right now. Seriously. Thank you. What else have you got under there? Go in there and sit on the couch. Why? Get the fuck out of here! This is not even funny. It had its perks, working in the evidence locker, um? Seriously. What the fuck are you doing?! Cocaine. What? What do you mean, "what?" What do you mean, "what do you mean, what?" How much it is worth, then? Thirty, thirty-five grand. Are you... are you fucking shitting me right now? No. Not right now. Usually, yes, but not right now. Don't be such a fucking wuss. - Oh, so now you're just full-on bully? Oh, little sissy! You know what this is, right? I know perfectly well what it is. Little bitch. - This is highly addictive. - Yeah, whatever. Fine. And not because I need it, actually, but because I want to, and maybe also I need it. I never thought I'd say this, but... I'm proud of you. - For doing drugs? - For having the guts to try it. Thirty-five grand? Thirty, thirty-five. Thereabouts. - How do you... - That's just for the coke. What the fuck else have you got under that sink?! Cocaine. Cannabis. LSD. Valium. Amphetamines. Roofies. Sobril. Heroin. Ecstasy! - Oh! Hello. - And... Glock 17. - Because, why? Oh, no! So what were you planning on doing with all this stuff? I don't know... And it was just collecting dust in the evidence locker room. No one even noticed when I switched a few things out. But they did, though, didn't they? They couldn't really prove anything. Or afford a huge public scandal? So, I mean... was it... was any of this worth it? Sometimes. Yeah? In what way? Ever notice something... the few times we have sex nowadays? Um... No, I... no. There's this... thing we always eat. - Eat? - Yeah. - The muffins?! - Ecstasy muffins! - Oh, that's smart. - Thanks. I'm not getting much of a buzz. Do you, um... I don't know, should we do another small one? This is a public service announcement... Do you wanna watch a movie? I mean, there's fuck all on TV. - Sure. - Could get an old VHS out? They told us to keep busy, right? Use your water only for... What the... shit?! Sorry. My mother gave me that. But you... you hate your mother. So? That's not the point. - Sorry. - I heard you the first time. Sor... - I'm gonna take a bath. - I'm gonna make breakfast. So, yesterday was... Eye-opening. Maybe we need to face the fact that we're gonna be here for a while. So I think we should prepare ourselves for the long haul. I've got a few things in mind. Three... two... one! Okay, okay, okay. Go! Go! Go! At least Mom's china wasn't a total waste. Oh, hey! Not the Stoli. Shit, isn't it time? Oh, goddammit! Goddammit is right. - That's good shit. - Awesome shit. It's three o'clock, right? - Um, yeah. Weren't they supposed to air now? Yeah. What the hell?! What the hell?! Yeah, what the hell?! Is there anybody? - Oh, hi. - Hello. Hi. Hi. How are you? Oh, fine. How... how do you do? Well, yeah. Doing rather well. Would you mind if we come in? If we don't bother, we'd really appreciate it if we could. Yeah. If it's... if it's convenient. - Sure. - Sure. Sure thing. Shush. Hi. Come in, come in. So we got stuck in the laundry room after the crash, and once we got out, we realized there were infected people in our apartment. And then, we passed by and saw this broken glass outside your door. And I instantly got what it was. Yeah, smart. Thank you. And have you heard anything at all? Our phones died last night, so... Um, no, we haven't. Not even on the radio. It's, um... it's just... Dead. Lots of people fleeing, it seems. Yeah. You wouldn't happen to have anything to eat? Maybe just a little... snack? We kind of haven't eaten in two days now. - Yeah. It's true. - Yeah. - Of course. - So kind of you. What the fuck are we gonna do now?! I don't know. Uh, wait... What do you mean? Are we supposed to feed these two now as well? I mean, you know what happened to them, right? Uh, no. What? You know, she was pregnant, and then, apparently, she had a stillborn child. - Oh. - And I think now, she can't get pregnant. And apparently, after that, she just went a bit, uh... Yeah, bananas, totally. - Oh... how awful. I mean... still, it's no excuse for taking down my reminders in the laundry room. We can't just throw them out just because she wrote some angry notes in the laundry room. But how long, though? This cuts our food supplies in half. Okay, let's just take this one step at a time. She was doing her laundry right after me and I just put a reminder up. And when I went back to get my detergent, the note was gone. I mean, some people, just... Maybe they've come out here to regroup, get their strength back up. And then, they'll... head back out and look for help? Sure. Maybe we can help them to arrive at that decision. What's your plan? Turn all Nazi on them? No! Just... give them a little nudge... before they eat all our food. - Take all our jobs, change our culture, fuck our women? That kind of thing? Excuse me. What? Cocaine. It totally stifles hunger! Thank you so much. I feel so much better now. Yeah, me too. Thank you! It's really... super. Thank you. Oh, I love your dress. I have the exact same one. I love it. And we've got that same telly! - Oh. - Yes. I... I think there's quite a few things we've got in common. Sorry to be blunt, um... What are your plans... now? I mean, you're obviously welcome to stay here, but it's just... our food supplies are limited. And we really don't know when or if the rescue teams are coming. Oh, yes, of course, we get it. Uh, sorry. We'd probably feel the same way if the shoe was on the other foot. No, no, no, no. You want us to leave, say the word. - Yeah. - Yeah, sure. No, of course not. You can... you can stay here. How kind of you, thank you. Obviously, we appreciate what you're doing to help us, so... If there's anything we can do to contribute, just let us know. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You're our guests. That's very nice. Would you like a drink? Well, yes, I never say no to a drink. Of course you wouldn't. Yeah. Thank you. - No, don't mention it. No, but... Really, if there's anything that we can do to help, just... just say the word. Anything at all. - Thank you. Sure. What are you good at? What's that? What are you... good at? Oh, uh... Emily is the best at cleaning. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, aren't you? It's like walking around a china shop where we live, yeah! Can't even move, is it? Yeah, well, Leo is good at um... I was gonna say "nothing." Uh, organizing, right? Is that a thing? Organizing. What do you mean, organizing? Hello! Your toolbox? So how about, uh... you spruce the place up a little bit later. And... How about you put some order in here? - Yes, sure. - Yeah. Great. - Oh! - You like red? Yeah! Yeah, yeah... It's not all about processing power, John. Mac's OS is just superior, everyone knows that. That's bullshit. No, no, no, no... All that Mac crap are just... they're just Windows rip-offs. Even my students know that. - No! Now, you really need to understand that... What? Sorry, what do I need to understand? That you're probably right. Yeah... About? About PC being better than Mac. Yeah! Exactly. Hey. I knew you'd come around. So, we should probably try and get some sleep, huh? Yeah, yeah. Is there anywhere we could have a little sleep, maybe? Um... You could sleep on the floor down there. You want us to sleep on the floor!? Uh, yeah, I mean, you can have the sofa cushions and I can get you some more pillows. I just assumed the couch pulled out. You know what, it does, it does pull out, but it's really hard to pull back in, so... yeah. Uh... okay, okay. Oh! Do you think you could loan us a spare toothbrush? Loan? What, are you gonna return it? No, no, sorry, I mean, we would buy you a new one, of course. Just... I'm kidding! Of course you can loan a toothbrush. Oh, oh... Not everyone gets her sense of humour. They think they're so much better than us just because they've got four bedrooms. It's 120 square feet more. Then, why don't we just tell them to go? For fuck's sake, think! How will that make us look? The whole neighbourhood would find out that we hadn't helped them. Yeah, I didn't think of that. I know what we could do. Something really annoying. What the fuck? - What are you doing? - Ah! - Slap it. - What? Slap my fucking ass. Slap it harder! So they can hear it! Put your back into it! Ah! Ah! Another one? Just a minute. Should I come back later? All done. After you. - Thank you. I was thinking, after breakfast, you could get started on that thing we talked about? I'm sorry, um... What thing? You know, you could clear the table, do the dishes. General cleaning up. And you, Leo, you could do some organizing. Right? Yeah. And what do you want me to organize? Our socks, they're all jumbled up. If you could pair them up, that would be great. Sure. Sound good? - Sounds good. - Great. It's a deal. Deal. Honey, um, I fell asleep during that karate video. Can we continue watching it? Yeah, sure. I'm sorry. God! Can you believe this shit? Yeah, it's pretty weird. Pretty weird?! We don't have to put up with this shit. Maybe write an angry note about it. What? I said, what are we gonna do about it? Pretty soon, we're gonna have to act. Act? You realize that this is gonna come down to them or us? You think I'd look good with a stache like Lee Van Cleef? Who? That guy. I've finished the dishes. Oh, great. Uh... you can help your husband do the socks now, if you want to. Sure. Only if you really want to, though. Yeah, no, I'd... I'd love to. Fuck me, you're evil. They won't last the day. I know hate is a strong word, but I hate their fucking guts! Just play along. Their home, their rules. What?! They're sitting there watching a movie and we're out here sorting their socks. Yeah. And what, you don't think that's degrading? No. I mean, I do, but... We need to do something. We could just get the fuck out of here. No one's making us stay. What, are you on their side now? - No, no, no, no but... - The gloves are coming off. It's us or them. And what do you have in mind? Mutiny. We rise up. We take power. And how do you propose we do that? I don't know. Not yet. Not yet... We play along with their game for now, and find their weaknesses. And... Overpower them in their sleep. Yeah. We'll do it tonight! - Yeah. And I'd really like her to put up a good fight, because... Oh, I love it when you get all evil. We're all done with the socks. Should we do it now? Do what?! Um... I thought I'd bake you some cookies. To say thank you for having us stay. She's awesome at baking cookies. Yeah. Great. Yeah. But let me make them, though. After all, you're our guests. - Oh, that's nice. - That is nice. - You're really super nice. - Mm. Sit down, watch a movie. Kick back. Escape reality for a... little bit. Yeah, that's a very good idea. Thank you. What have you got? I'll pick a good one for you. Enjoy! And what did you pick? Out of Africa. Oh... Thank you, that's a... a classic. Excuse me. Do this. Be prepared. This film is a tactical move. - A tactical move?! - Yeah. Out of Africa? It's probably the most boring film of all time. She is trying to put us to sleep. I think we've underestimated our dear opponents. You think? When they thought I was asleep, I heard them say, "Should we do it now?" Okay? "Should we kill them now?" What? No, no, no, no. That's a little bit extreme. I'm telling you, Curler Bitch and Country Club Asshole know they wouldn't stand a chance out there. But if... if they're out to kill us, what do you want to do about it? I've got a plan. You can't tame me. I'm a lioness. - Oat cookies. - Mm... Fresh from the oven. Help yourselves. Uh... what's in them? Oh, um... the usual. Plus a secret ingredient. I'll put some coffee on, too. Honey, could you help me with the cups? - Course. - Plenty more where they came from. These are really good. Mm. Well? What's the secret ingredient? Amphetamines! Are you... Are you serious?! I thought you were gonna say... Valium or something. How much? - All of it. All of it?! Here are the coffees. Oh, coffee, coffee! Oh, yes! Coffee, coffee, coffee! Oh, I like coffee. I can't live without coffee, actually. It's like, living... you can't live without breathing! You know what's strange, or crazy? That fish, they can breathe in the water. Yeah, what's also very, very weird that water can be a solid or a gas. So strange! Did you see that YouTube clip? - Oh, with the sneaky cat? The sneaky cat. Yes, of course, the sneaky cat! It was a bit horrible, but funny at the same time. Oh, so strange. What... what's the matter? Keep on breathing. Calm down. Your throat? Do you have... something? You're... argh... You're so... so super nice. Thank you. Maybe I overdid it. How much was... "all of it"? Two tablespoons. Probably overdid it then. They're just passed out, right? No, I think we, um... we murdered them. - Fuck! - Hmm. Fuck indeed. I don't think this qualifies as murder though. Oh, no? We offered them the cookies. We didn't make them eat them. I don't think that's gonna stand up in a court of law. - Probably not. - Probably not! Oh... Son-of-a-fucking-bitch. What should we do with the bodies? Maybe we could... just drag them to their apartment. Let's do that. Okey-dokey. - Hey. - Yeah? You did good. Uh... Yeah. Yeah, in the space of 48 hours, we started taking drugs and murdering people. Not sure I... ..."did good" here. It was either us or them. Maybe you're right. What the hell was that?! Wait here. What the actual... fuck...? They must've been infected. Maybe we all are. Shit! Goddammit! Son-of-a-goddamn-shit-bitch. This is serious shit. Dead serious. We should probably get some sleep. It's the Valium. Do not come to us, we will come to you. Do not come out! I repeat, do not come out. Turn on a light in your windows so we can see you. Do not come to us, we will come to you. I repeat, do not come out. Do not come out! If you're in, turn on a light in your windows so we can see you. Do not come to us. We will come to you. Hi. What's going on? Every day could be our last. So why not be who you want to be? If I'm gonna go out, I'm... ...gonna go out being myself. Sit down. I'll... I'll make you some breakfast. What's this? Ecstasy. Oh... I see... I've been thinking. Okay. If we make it out of here alive, I want to adopt a child. Sure. Let's do it. I have a lot of love to give. And when there's no outlet for it, it turns into this... negative, destructive thing that I keep bottled up. And all these... raging emotions... ...fighting to get out. I know. But that's over now. I want to start living again. I've never stopped loving you. I guess I never stopped loving you, either. Maybe... a part of that love... died when... Well. I suppose I'll have to make you fall in love with me all over again. - Yeah? - Yeah. How are you gonna do that? Let's get reacquainted. I'd like that. Would you like to go on a date with me? You know, I'm very happy you said yes. Thank you. So, tell me about you. Who is John? Gonna powder my nose. - Okay. Uh, well... I... I guess I'm a guy who... who lost his way in life. I met this great, amazing, beautiful girl. We fell madly in love with one another. All we wanted to do was multiply that love. Things in life don't work out how you want them to. For various reasons. See, our thing was that we... we... we couldn't get pregnant. Oh... But... That was a huge... a huge disappointment in life for both of us. The thing about life is you have all these... ideas about how you want it to turn out, and then, it doesn't turn out that way. So... I withdrew. I hid within myself and behind my job. But then, something happened. What? The end of the world. And then what? Then, it kind of... Yeah, it kind of gave me a perspective on things. You know, that happiness, my happiness can be determined by... can be determined by what I've got, and not necessarily... by what I can't have. So... all I'm... really wanting is, uh... is... is another chance. I think we both kind of lost our way there. Mm-hmm. But the thing about losing your way is that there's... there's always a chance of finding it again. We lost our way pretty badly, though. True. Sure. So, maybe the way back is a little longer. So what? If we're both... willing to try. And you know, maybe it's true what they say, that the main thing is the journey. Who are "they"? I've always wondered. Christ, me too. Well, if we find them, I'll just bake them some oat cookies. Oh, yes. Definitely. What are we watching? Notting Hill. Okay. You're still the most beautiful thing I know. Maybe that's them. They must have seen the X's! - Who is it? - Rescue team, ma'am. We're here to bring you out. - It's the rescue team! No, no, don't open the door! No, no! Sit! Shh... Shut up! I'm not sure if they're still following us. No, I don't think so. Oh... Look what we have here. A couple people that hasn't run away yet. - What do you want? - What do you think? We seen that your light is still on. Everyone else is gone. So what do you have to hide? Nothing. We're not hiding anything. There's nothing of value here. Really? It's okay. It's okay. - So what's she worth to you? - Everything. You have five minutes... to go in and collect your money, your jewelry, your valuables or whatever, or I smash her beautiful, little face in. Hmm? She's the only thing worth any value to me. Then, maybe we should take her. What do you think? Yeah, maybe we should. Take this little whiny twat in there. Get up. And you... You are coming with me. Don't you fucking try anything! - No! Don't touch her! What are you gonna do about it? Please. Please...? Please, what? Please, fuck me? Huh? What? Am I ugly or something? - Yeah, okay... - Yeah, okay. Okay, what? I'm ugly? Or yeah, okay, fuck me? Yeah, whatever. You guys alright? Yeah, they got a lot of crap! Oh, fuck! Say please. Don't touch it. What the fuck did you do!? Come on, wake up. It was her. Don't you fucking touch her! Please, please. Wait. You're alright? They're not fucking worthy. Fuck them. It's so quiet. It's like we're the only two people left in the world. That'd be nice. Do not come out. I repeat, do not come out. Come to your windows so we can see you. - We're in here! - Hey! Stop! - Help! - Come back! Wait! They're not seeing us. What the fuck are we gonna do now? Make a run for it? Oh, fuck, they're gone. We're almost out of food. There's a shitload of infected fuckers out there and they know we're in here. We don't stand a chance. Hey, hey. We just... Let's rest up. We need to sleep. Okay? And then... Then, we plan our escape. Morning. Or evening. I've... I've laid some clothes out for you on the sofa. The knives are sharpened. Gun's loaded. And there's fresh batteries in the torch. Are you ready for this? I won't be any more ready tomorrow. We're gonna be alright. We just chop through. We don't stop and fight. We just chop and keep going. I just want to say... You won my love back. I love you now more than ever. I want you to know that. Oh, fuck. Fuck! We should go regroup. Okay? We should go think. For a moment. For a moment... We can't be the only ones left, right? Thanks. What is it? When we were... ...running out of the warehouse... ...one of them bit me... before I could get away. If... well, if you are infected, maybe it won't break out whilst you're still alive. So we just keep you alive. We just keep you alive. I mean, there's probably a vaccine out there by now. There's probably been one all along. I... I guarantee, I think there's... ...some pharmaceutical company that's just waiting to cash in on their vaccine. So it's gonna be okay. Yeah. Wow! Thank you. Where are you going? I had a nightmare. So you're just gonna take off? There's something growing inside me. There's this... hunger. A hunger that just keeps... growing. I have an idea. What the fuck are you doing?! Shh... Here. Now, you drink that. I'm not a fucking vampire! Drink it! Let's just see if this makes a difference to... to whether... Well? It isn't working? No, it is. It is working. Okay. But you can't... keep doing this. Look. We'll just keep you afloat until help arrives. They'll have a vaccine. They will have a vaccine, yes. This is just some... - Some what? Some fucking pharmaceutical company trying to cash in? Exactly. Let's just see if this keeps your hunger at bay. It's no use. This is what we're doing! It's my choice! Alright? It's my choice. It's my fucking choice. Oh fuck, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can smell your wound. Go. Now, go clean it. Cover it up. Go, go now! Today, we try it your way. Tomorrow, I get to decide what I do. Nothing? Nothing at all. Like the whole world's come to a halt. Are you... hungry? - Stop it. - But... Rest assured, I'll let you know when I'm... hungry, okay? But, if... today is gonna be my day, I want the day to be perfect. - So do I. - That's good. Come this way. Over here. We're gonna sit down. Because there's something I want to talk to you about. Okay... What do you want to talk to me about? Our future. Because this is how I see everything playing out now. Now... tomorrow... we're gonna wake up to the sound of a knocking at the door. It's the rescue team. Obviously, I'm right. There is a vaccine. But... But? The vaccine has a side-effect that we don't... we don't really notice it at first. But then, you... you start to get a little sick. In the mornings. And... around nine months later... she arrives. Our first-born child. First-born? Yeah. Because a year later, we'll have Luke. Little Luke. We'll need a bigger house. That's fine because... I would've been promoted to head teacher by then, so we can finally get that big old house in the country. And we'll have a greenhouse. Where we... - Grow our weed. Yeah. And our tomatoes. - Really? - Mm. Both our kids, they'll want to go to uni. We'll be proud parents. But no matter how much we love them... we'll be pleased to see them leave. Why is that? Because we can fuck like rabbits. And we'll have loads of grandchildren. And the thing... the thing we'll look forward to the most every year will be spending Christmas, together, with the whole family. A crazy big family. Ginormous. Yeah. That's right. But the thing I'll look forward to more than anything... is that I get to grow old with you. True. I want that more than anything in this world. It'll be alright. I think I'm gonna take a bath. Hi. There you go. - But honey... - It's fine. No muffins? No muffins needed today. "My darling, honey, there's only one word that sums you up: perfect. I had gotten myself into a dark place, but you pulled me back into the light. You were my lighthouse, guiding me safely to shore. I'm not lost anymore. I'm so happy that I met you, and that you chose me. Our children love you, and I loved growing old with you. When I look back on it, my life has been perfect. And it's all thanks to you." Thank you. "That's my reality. It's what I'm taking with me. In my nightmare, however, the hunger took over. In the end, I couldn't fight it, and I couldn't let it take you. Unfortunately I don't know how to end it, so I'm asking you for one last thing. End my nightmare. You'll find it in the nursery. I love you, always. Karen." You died first. But the funeral's... beautiful. People thought I was nuts to put a vine of tomatoes in your coffin. But you know why I did. I kept having Christmases at our house. The kids would come. The grandkids would come. And we'd drink to you. Every single year. You know, I've never met anyone new. You gave me all the love that I ever needed. I continued to live for a while. Then, I quietly pass away. Although, I... I don't really know what happened after that point. I like to think that we... we continue to create magical adventures together. For the rest of eternity. Forgive me. This one was marked with an X, too. Is anybody here? Check every room. There's no one here. I heard something. Over there. Be careful. There's something in there. - Ready? - On three. 1, 2... Go! Watch it. What the fuck? What the hell is this? Why are their arms taped together? The fuck are we looking at here? Love. Johansson.
