Okay. -I went shopping. -Was there a sale? -I didn’t go. -I bought quite a few things. -There was so much on sale. -I stayed home. -Your dress is pretty. -You think so? I bought it yesterday for the birthday party. -Did you go somewhere today? -I got things ready for your visit. Bring this to your father and tell him to come home early. -In those clothes? -No! What’s the problem with these? I’ve told you. Don’t argue in front of everybody. Now button it. Go on, all the buttons. Happy birthday, Papa! My daughter. Sweets! Wonderful. These are very delicious. Very sweet. He’s going to have the white guy taste. This should be fun. Here, Nisha. Thank you, Papa! I love you! Thank you! -1000 kroner? -You’re lucky. -Now you can party. -You bet! -She’s saving for her license. -lt’s very expensive. She can become a doctor, engineer, lawyer... -Yes, she has very good grades. -That’s great. Where did you get that? -Did you steal it? -No, it’s from Dad. Let me see. Is it real? You can take this one. We almost got caught. -I can’t believe it. -lt’s such an adrenaline rush! -3.5 million? -Yes, he bought it for 3.5 million. ln Oslo you’d have to pay twice that. Go eat some real food! Nisha? My daughter. Where have you been? Come greet everyone. -He||o. -Hi. You look good. -How are you? -Fine, thank you. There’s keema naan in the kitchen. She sure has grown.

Come, Asif! -MEET TONIGHT? -CAN’T, SORRY Take a selfie. That’s enough for me. Najma is so shy. I am exhausted! I’m too old for this. Nisha, come here. Mirza would dance to this song every day, if allowed. Your father made us all dance. Now everyone will talk about how vulgar we are. Is it vulgar for a family to dance together? Dancing is bad. People don’t like it. It isn’t proper to dance in the presence of other men. I’m sure they’re talking about us. Ridiculous! Don’t just sit down, Nisha. Come and help me! I’m too tired. I’m also tired. If all the receipts aren’t here, we’ll be ﬁned. I’ll check in the drawer. Let’s send some money to my mother and sister. You sent some a week ago. It’s my birthday. Let them enjoy it too. You only care about them. My family is also in Pakistan. You could think about them too. Nisha, come and help me. ltold you, I’m too exhausted. Fine, we’ll just leave it. Why should I have to do it? That was Emily. She sent me a math problem. 4.5 times 17.6. Do you know the answer? Hurry! It’s a competition. -70.2. -Thank you. I’m going to bed. -Good night. -Good night. ljust lost count. -You wrote 11 for 200? -|’|| correct it. Have you asked my parents if you can marry me? -No way! -No? You haven’t? Then what are you doing here? I wanted to see you, I guess. Turn it off! lcan’t ﬁnd it. You bastard! Papa, no! Papa, no! Shut your mouth! I’ll kill you! How dare you bring him into my house to do such things? You shut up! Shut up! Do you want to talk about what happened? No? Don’t feel guilty. You haven’t done anything wrong. Yes. What do you mean? -lt’s all my fault. -What? -lt’s my fault. -No, it isn’t your fault. Your father is not allowed to hit. It’s good your neighbor called the police. Who knows what might have happened to you and Daniel? But... lshouldn’t have done that. You haven’t done anything wrong. Once you and your father have a chance to talk, everything will be ﬁne. You haven’t done anything wrong. You should try to sleep. That usually helps. I’ll be right next door. In case you need someone to talk to. I’ll be at work until at least 7:00 am. tomorrow. Come by anytime. Nisha? Shit. How are you? lhate him. |f hetouches me again... I’ll kill him. lcan’t do this anymore. Hello, Papa. Have a seat. I hope you both feel rested and are motivated to solve this conﬂict. Papa. We... We are all fond ofNisha. But if she wants to return home, we have some demands. He says that they love me, but that they have some demands. This is an agreement. It says that Nisha has to marry her boyfriend. They want you to sign this. Have you read... this agreement? What do you think about the demands? Daniel and |broke up. What? ldon’t love him. You what? How can that be? You slept with him. I haven’t slept with him. Don’t lieto me. -You’re lying! -No, I’m not. You had sex! -I don’t want such a daughter! -No! How can you refuse to marry him when you have had sex? -I haven’t had sex, Papa. -Yes, you have! I can’t live with you! I don’t want a daughter like you! But I haven’t done anything wrong! lhaven’t done anything wrong! You know how easily children are inﬂuenced at a young age. They do what other children do. We have to think about the future. About other Pakistani children, and how this might inﬂuence them. If one child does this, then a second, third and fourth will do the same. We won’t be able to stop it. Therefore we must nip such behavior in the bud. Orwe can’t show our face to anyone. I understand you don’t want to be strict. She’s your daughter and you love her. Every father loves his daughter. I also view my daughter with love. But... I am also worried about my other children. If it were me, I’d punish her in such away that no one would ever consider doing the same thing. -Nisha ? -Hi . How are you? I miss you so much. I miss you too. Why don’t you come home, so we can solve this together? Yes, of course. Great. I’ll talk to your father and have him fetch you. Thank you, Mama. Just come home to me. -Hi! -Hi. I’m going to see my parents. Can’t you wait ﬁll our next meeting? We’ve talked. Everything is okay. You should wait till after the meeting. -But we talked. -And? -Everything is okay. -Are you sure? -When will you be back? -Soon. Hello. Did it ever cross your mind what the effect of your actions would be on the rest of us? On your dignity? On ourdignity? Everyone is laughing at us. Did you even think about that? Huh? Our relatives and friends have stopped coming to our shop. What were you thinking? Nisha, honey? Do you have any idea how much your mother is suffering? She has to lie to make people think better of you. What were you thinking? You have no idea the things we have done for you. We left our country. Went all over Europe. Went to jail in Germany. I did work Norwegians won’t do. Worked in a factory. We had to work and earn money so that our children, you, could get a better life. So that you could get a better education. And you do this to us? Do you think about anyone but yourself? If you live like those Western idiots, you’ll go mad. The loneliness will kill you. Do you understand? Where are we going? Papa, where are we going? Asif, where are we going? Asif? Where are you taking us? Papa, where are we going? Where are we going, Papa? For a short drive. I don’t want to! Asif, help me! Answer me, Asiﬂ Answer me! -I don’t want to go. -Shut up! Shut up! You shut up! Keep your mouth shut! Asif, where are we going? Can’t you answer me? Why won’t you answer me? -Can’t you just enjoy the trip? -What kind of a trip? -The city looks beautiful from here. -It sure does. -Look at the moon. -It sure looks lovely. See that car? I want one ofthose. That one? lt’s outstanding. What is that? A BMVW That’s a BMW 730 diesel. You like it? Yes, it’s very nice. You know how much it costs? 1.6 million kroner. -That’s too much.

To study, or to contact Child Welfare? I didn’t contact Child Welfare. You didn’t? Then why did they send this letter? They’ve summoned us to a meeting. Do you plan to lie?

Is it true that you went to Pakistan of your own free will? I wanted to learn about my parents’ culture. It was wonderful. You sent a Facebook message to Emily. That isn’t what you wrote there. Nisha sent a message to Emily from Pakistan. I think we should have a word with Nisha in private. Would you mind waiting outside? No problem. Why do they want to talk to her in private? Listen. It’s very important that you tell the truth now. Yes, when I wrote that message l was very angry. I didn’t mean what I wrote. I liked it there. The tone in this message was different. Are you sure you’re telling us everything? Yes. It’s quite brutal. You wrote that you had been kidnapped. That you were locked up and beaten. Isn’t that true? You sound utterly desperate. It wasn’t like that. l exaggerated. l was just very angry. There can be grave consequences when you send a message like that. Especially when we know what has happened. I didn’t think... I wasn’t thinking. l was just very angry. Everything was so new and different. Are you the type to send messages full oflies? That isn’t how I see you. I don’t remember. It was a long time ago. But I enjoyed being there once I got used to it. You know we’re here for you, right? We care about you. Contact us if you need anything. Our intent is not to hurt your family in any way. Or your parents. Can I leave now? Yes. How dare you send an e-mail to Child Services? I didn’t send an e-mail to them. You’ve put us in a position where we can’t face anyone anymore. Hello.

This marriage will be very good for both families. Adnan, you have completed medical school? -Yes, lhave completed it. -Asif also wants to be a doctor. And Nisha may study over there. Then she can work as well. No, there is no need for studies or work. Adnan earns plenty of money. She’ll be busy enough with children and the house.
