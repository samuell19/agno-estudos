What's his name? Taro, if I remember correctly. Just one name? We call him Taro, or the "blue tent philosopher." Philosopher? He always read difficult books. They'll be here in 5 minutes. Philosopher they call him. We'd better keep asking. He's dead? Poor devil managed to survive the scorching summer. He was fine the day before yesterday. Did you get unemployment? I thought he'd last longer. Is quite sad. There wasn't much for him to live for anyway, was there? Les have a drink. To the memory of Taro. Good man. Taro asked me for a favor. He said he could trust me. Apparently, many years ago... he hid something in a house at Noto. Treasure, right? He told you? That's his raving. Is that right? Is he okay? Sorry to keep you. Did you get your severance? No, I didn't. The president disappeared. You have a family though? A mortgage? I did, but we had to sell the house. For half its value. Is not easy looking for a job... after being laid off, especially at your age. I don't mind getting a lower salary. I really need the job. Thanks for coming. We'll be in touch. - Good luck. - Thank you. Hello. Hello? Is me. Did you get unemployment? Can you wire it right away? I've got a lot of bills to meet this month. Yes, sure. How is Kyohei? He's fine. Did you find a new job? No luck yet. I had three interviews last week. Get one before your insurance runs out. Otherwise we'll never get back to Tokyo. I know. I'll do my best. That's a joke. When have you ever done your best? I'm sorry. Don't grovel. Act like a man. Be sure to wire the money. Look, I... Head towards the river... and just before the inlet, you'll find a red bridge. There's a house beside it. Is covered with trumpet flowers. They're lovely, you'll soon spot them. Upstairs there's a window overlooking the red bridge. From the other side, the Japan Sea and the Tateyama Range. You hid it in there? I didn't hide it. I just forgot to take it with me. Look, he got my gear wet! Poor fishermen, they have a schedule and a quota to keep. I stole a gold Buddhist statue from a Kyoto temple. I hid it in a pot. Why were you down there? It was just after the war, all my family had died in the air raids. I was in shock. I roamed around, stealing to get by. Then I hightailed it out of Kyoto. I went down to the end of the Noto Peninsula. I stayed at that house for a month. You never went back for it? One thing led to another and I never did go back. I can't stay in one place for too long. I didn't think the house you live survived. But a friend was down there five years ago, and he said he saw it. It sounds like a novel. Why don't you go claim it in my place? You can keep it. Ill easily sell for over a million yen. All I want is to know how it was. Please do it for me. Good. We've got a deal. WARM WATER UNDER A RED BRIDGE Starring: KOJI YAKUSHO MISA SHI MIZU KAZUO KITAMURA MITSUKO BAISHO Executive Producer MASAYA NAKAMURA Original Story by YO HENMI Screenplay by MOTOFUMI TOGAWA DAISUKE TENGAN, SHOHEl I MAMURA General Producer NAOTO SARUKAWA Music by SHI NICHI RO I KEBE Editing by HAJI ME OKAYASU Production Design by HISAO I NAGAKI Photography by SHIGERU KOMATSUBARA Lighting by HI DEAKI YAMAKAWA Recording by KENICHI BENITANI Produced by HISA II NO Directed by SHOHEl I MAMURA Excuse me, is there a red bridge around here? Go down that way, you'll see it over the river. I see. Thank you. Excuse me. Perhaps you can help me. Excuse me? I'm looking for a red bridge near here. This way? Thank you very much. The red bridge! Taro... Is still here! I'm going shopping. Wait! You haven't paid for that. The boxed lunch. I don't want it. Excuse me. "Suisen Steamed Buns" Anyone here? Anybody home? Sorry. I tried the bell... May I help you? Grandma. You really shouldn't smoke in here. Is too dangerous in here. I think this is yours. I found it at the supermarket, but you drove off. I saw the car outside, so I thought maybe you lived here. She gave me this fortune prophecy, "Luck cometh!" Thank you. Would you like some cheese? Come on up. The upstairs windows. One of them overlooks the red bridge. From the other side of the house you can see the Tateyama Range across the Japan Sea. I'm here from Tokyo. I'm on vacation. Kind of a delayed summer vacation. Utensils for making Japanese cakes. You would?ve seen more downstairs. The shop was quite prosperous. Until Grandma became senile. A few kind tea masters still order from us. Somehow we get by. European peppered cheese. This is the cheese. The one you saw. They mix cream and pepper into goat milk... then some pine nuts and paprika. I think these little crimson spots are red peppers. Do you do that all the time? I think it would go very well with ice. You saw me shoplift the cheese. Then you saw the puddle of water. Wait... You must never tell anyone... about the water. Is so embarrassing. The water? Is cold, hot, and it feels so good. Water! Is welling up. The water! Water? Grandma is downstairs... I'm so ashamed. No, no! Forgive me. Is never felt so good. Here it comes. I can't hold it anymore. "Excellent luck" They'll soon dry out. Is not like is urine. Honestly, I've never vented so much before. A first for me too. I bet it was a shock. It was so unexpected. The supermarket? Same thing? Yes. It wells up inside me. Until I become full. I can feel it. All the way up to here. When you fill up like that, then you shoplift? Yes, I can't stop myself. I have to do something wicked. All of them? You shoplifted all this? There's more. But I've eaten all the cheese. These foibles of mine... do they disgust you? Not at all. Really? How can I put it? More surprised, I suppose. That's good. But still, I'm a perfect stranger. What if I were a crook? I know you're not. How can you be so sure? Grandma never gives bad people her fortune predictions. You just said she was senile. She still thinks the local shrine is paying her to write them. She writes until she drops from exhaustion. She's amazingly accurate. Mine said, "Good will come." I've been "unlucky" for ages... but now I'm "for the better." Your pants are dry. I got another one. Is got some pull. He's scaring the fish away. Who is he, anyway? An athlete at that punk college. I knew that! The training shows. See how well he casts. No need to be so impressed. He should know the rules here. You go tell him. Why me? You're the oldest. You're always bragging about going to America. But at the moment, the enemy is not American, he's African. That's a good haul. Some big ones. Hey, you! How many times you gotta be told? You can't use a net here. I don't understand Japanese. Fuck off! You gotta pay to use a net here. Cheapskate college! They give you Africans athletic scholarships. But they don't feed you properly! How are you going to win? Better go back to Africa. He came all the way from Africa, let him have a few fish. What's that? I'll pay for him, if is not too expensive. And how much do you reckon? Shintaro, don't. No fighting with outsiders. You listen up! We got rules around here. We stock this river with fingerlings. It costs money!! Leave him be. Women should shut up! What are you doing here? I just thought this was a good place to stay. Looking for work? A job? You've got a good build. But no cash. One of our pals is in the hospital, is his liver. Picked it up from some slut. You know, hepatitis C or B. I don't know what. He went all yellow, like a banana. That's 'cause she was a student. They're the most dangerous. Anyway, we're short a man. You want to try? I've never done it before. We use fixed nets. Is like factory work. We urgently need a man. Is for two or three weeks at the most. You've got 30 seconds. We're going to karaoke. I'll give it a shot. Good. I'll talk to the boss. He's my old man. No place to stay? There's one place, a dump, the food sucks, no one stays there. The Badger Inn? But it sure is cheap! C'mon. Tomorrow at 3 a.m. Don't be late. Thank you! Wait! Why did you hire him? You didn't notice? He showed sympathy for that African. So? People like that tend to be serious workers. Are you serious? But he sure is handsome. You ever cheat on me again, and you're dead! Watch the road! What? Are you hungry already? That man who came today? He won't come back. He's from Tokyo. Is coming. Is venting. I'm so embarrassed. Is never been like this before. Is coming. Dinner's ready. Are you coming? Yes! Are you a friend of Aizawa's? Who's Aizawa? By the red bridge. The place with that monster bird. They used to be confectioners. Sak?? They made good sweets. I'm not a friend, I just dropped by. After she went senile, that youngster moved in. Are they related? I don't know. Is none of our business. The old lady lived alone there for a long time. All done. Is not hot enough. No taste, is gone all yellow. Hang on. Wasabi. Where did it get to? Wasabi powder...? Swill, isn't it? I've put up with her cooking for 35 years. Is been hell. What was that? Here you are. Is freezing out. Is started snowing, no wonder is cold. Thank you. The factory next door made another offer for the house. Don't worry. We won't sell it. What are you doing? Aren't you eating? God, can she give her revelations after dinner? You've made such a mess. "First winter snow. Trumpet flowers bloom unseasonably. Third of November." The food sucks, doesn't it? I got it down. Feeling seasick? I'm fine. Just go easy. You'll get used to it. - Take a rest. - No, I'm okay. He's the spitting image. I told you, didn't I? But don't tell him. Id invite bad luck. "Net fishing strictly prohibited" Don't stop! Good work there, Ramin. We'll get you in the Biwako Marathon! You can run all the way there! Thad give you an appetite, wouldn't it? Nothing spurs you on like an empty belly. Better you don't. Don't take it. Everyone will see you do it. I only came to look. Okay, sure. I vented so much. I'll be fine for a while. Why are you here? I'm helping the fisherman. I started today. I'll be staying around for a while. I see. That's good. Wait. Would you mind having lunch with me? I have to run an errand before noon. But I've got time for tea at my place first. I won't be long. Can you wait? There are so many kinds of sweets... but is the water that makes them special. Good water is a must. But I ended up with more than my fair share. As long as you don't steal. Only the stealing? If you don't do wicked things, I prefer more water to less. I don't know how to explain it, but that's what I like. If you weren't a good man, I'd stab you to death. See the mullet! This is where the river meets the sea. That mixture attracts the fish. Mullet, sea bass, parrot fish. Maybe is just good water. I'm home. Come in. Have you had it looked at? Looked at what? The water thing. I did see a doctor once. He didn't believe me. I can see why. No one knows how much I suffer when it happens. Promise me you'll stop stealing. If it does happen again... I could help out. Look at the time! I'll go make sweets for your work mates. - You don't have to. - Those fishermen love sweets! There's a closet off the room with a view of the red bridge. I put it inside a cheap pot and stuffed it up the back. What's wrong? I'm looking for the toilet. Use the one downstairs. Hello. Is that you? Did you wire the money? Sorry, I've been busy. We need it as soon as possible. I'm not in Tokyo now. Where are you? In Toyama. I'm at a friends funeral. That's all well and good, but still... I'll wire you half right away. I'll send the rest from Tokyo. I don't have much choice. But don't let me down. Mr. Sasano. Here's your change from the wire transfer. Thank you very much. Come to Africa. There are no loans and no lay offs. You can fish the rivers. As a runner, I burn a lot of sugar. Thanks for the sweets. Our crazy coach allows only water when training. Japanese are not scientific. Why did you come to Japan? I have three wives. Then I have... 11 children. No, 13 children. I couldn't afford to feed them. I'm going to run in the next Olympics. I'll go home with a medal. In 10 years I'll be president. I'll appoint you as a minister. I'll hold you to it. Then I'll slaughter all the other tribes. Chop off their heads, freeze 'em, then have 'em for breakfast. Is just a joke. An African joke. Ramin! What the hell's going on? See you, Minister. Is a rare medical text. Compiled from Chinese originals 1000 years ago. The originals are all gone, scattered all over China. That volume is a sex manual. Ever heard of the Indian Kama Sutra? Yes, I have. The one about sex. What's the blue tent philosopher up to now? Is also instructional. This was written by the ancient Roman poet, Ovid. "Amores" or "Loves." Man's been a lecher all through history. The ruling class never had to worry about survival. They could devote all their energies to food and sex. You know why? They had nothing else to do? No. Because that's been the ideal life from ancient times. Squeeze what they could from the peasants. Then enjoy a degenerate life. Does it make you envious? I can't even imagine it. People today are all sick. Too learned to honestly admit to their desires. You must like sex too? Forget all the trivialities and throw yourself into lasciviousness. Easy to say, but I don't have the energy. What about you? What about me? I couldn't devote myself to lechery. Too late for me. I can't get a hard... on. Look, everything else aside, enjoy life... while you can still get a hard... on. Is no laughing matter. Be serious about it. Dirty old man. Getting used to it? Yes. Is my 6th day today. You learn fast. What did you do? Before your company went bankrupt. A firm of architects. Architects, eh? That's classy. So you graduated college? You must be an intellectual. I was in sales, I had to bow and scrape to everyone. That's why you're so humble. Am I? You haven't said "no" once. I doubt that. Your type ends up regretting. You have no criminal record. Criminal record? That worries my dad. We had a murder after a drifter like you appeared. A murder? Here? A long time ago, before I was born. He's getting old. Tells the same stories over and over. Is for you. They're upside down. Good morning. 'Morning. I'm full. Now, please. Just a minute. Again, thank you ever so much. Call me anytime. I'll come right away. To you I must appear like a slut. You certainly do. But I can't stop thinking about you. Strange, this time I filled up very quickly. Going straight home? Yes. Then after I eat, I'll take a nap. I want to show you something. Like what? Grandma says is okay. "As calm as the ocean appears, a wind is slowly rising. A small boat pitches and rolls on the waves." That's "bad luck." No, is "good luck." "A different atmosphere and place, will bring ease of mind. After trials, a man you'll find. Your wishes come true." When? In the end, it says. See? In this new research facility... we observe neutrinos which are generated... by the collision of cosmic rays and air... through 50,000 tons of super pure water. Neutrinos have poor reciprocal qualities... so they penetrate most known substances. They are unchanged when they reach earth from deep space... and the center of the sun. Something from the ends of the universe. We're linked to the far ends of the universe. At any given time... up to 100 neutrinos per cubic centimeter... are sharing the same space as we humans. Through studies of these neutrinos, we know... how the universe was born. We can also learn how our sun will change. Isn't this great? Is so 21 st century. When neutrinos collide with this body of water... a whitish blue, "Cherenkov Light" is generated. We must use super pure water... in order to prevent the light... from degrading. Question. Is this water drinkable? Yes, but it would taste terrible. Why is that? Because it contains no calcium nor magnesium. Don't drink it all at once. Ever hear of "Ouch Ouch Syndrome?" Yes. It was caused by cadmium... polluted discharge. The plant which discharged the cadmium was here. So, neutrinos are a new form of "Ouch Ouch Syndrome?" Many things are all somehow connected. My mother, she died in this river. Great god of our forefathers who watches over us. We beseech you to render assistance to your devotee. Great god of our forefathers who watches over us. We beseech you to render assistance to your devotee. Great god of our forefathers who watches over us. We beseech you to render assistance to your devotee. May your holy spirit be calmed by this plea. We shall always look to you. Remove from her the pain. Restore her to her former self. Stop this nonsense! How many times must I tell you? Is evil to work on her superstitions. - Back to hospital! - Never. No doctor can heal her. It is caused by the god's wrath. Stupid superstition! Is a medical condition! Is caused by man! Is cadmium poisoning. Stupid, ignorant superstition! What are you doing? That is sacrilege! Great god of Konsei! Mommy! Saeko! Mommy! Mommy! Saeko, no! Don't follow me! She has to puke! She's stopped breathing! Resuscitation. Call an ambulance! Start breathing, kid! - She hasn't puked. - Make her breathe. Bigger stones will comfort her spirit. You know... I'm a married man. Are you? There was nothing dramatic in my life. I never expected more than boring predictability. Then my company went bankrupt. I thought my career, my family, and everything was guaranteed. That was a big mistake. I had to sell my house, move away from my wife... and join the unemployment line. Sorry, you don't want to hear this. I expected the 21 st century to be different. But nothing's changed. - Hello. - I'm back. There's a tramp been waiting for you since lunch. The man stinks. - Gen? - You know him? Well, yes... Right on the ocean, is freezing here. I'm starving. Inside. Is warm here. Excuse me. Is got no taste at all. It was a trial getting here. I'm glad I found you. Otherwise, I'd have no way to get back. Did you find the pot? I found nothing. You don't want to share it. Ma'am. - Any tea? - Right away. - Sak?. - One more? There was nothing here. It was just Taro's delusion. So why didn't you come back? I lucked into a job. Helping out on a fishing boat. Lucked into...? Fishing is an interesting line of work. Half your luck, that is. I'll be staying for a while. No, you can't... Why not? You've got work. I've got a family. I can't afford you too. I'll look for the pot too. See you tomorrow. Good work. Where's he rushing off to? To see the monster. What do you mean? The monster who sucks out his vital essence. Gimme a break! It makes me horny. Les go to a hotel. So early in the day? My vital essence is overflowing. You pervert! Slacking off again! I'll run your ass off! Good morning. They're biting! Is a big bun. Look at that. Flounder! I don't believe it. That's impossible. See the eyes on the left side? That's a flounder, no mistake. I've got an eel! A saltwater eel! I'll need a net to land it. Grab it for me. I'll go down there. He don't know the difference 'tween a flounder and a turbot Thank you. Hungry? I'll go fix something. I'll feed you, too, parrot. What the hell am I doing? Hello. Is that you? I'm still not back in Tokyo. Is that right? Can you wait a little longer? Is not about the money. I think we'd better get a divorce. I'm sick of living like this. Hey, wait up. This is all so sudden. Then you'll be free. That's not the issue! I've thought it through. My parents agree. The sooner the better. Because I can't provide? Is not that. I just don't want to drag it out. So what is it? Have you found another man? You never change. You get confrontational when you're challenged. A perpetual loser. What about Kyohei? What about our son? He's made new friends here. He doesn't want to go back. I've sent you the divorce papers. Please sign them. Good bye. You should think more. Keep on thinking until your brain cells start to rot. My boss always said I was too hesitant, I thought too much. That only proves you don't think enough. The corporate culture... you see, they don't want the workers to think. They want fools who'll work all their lives without complaining. Just like jail. Feeling any better? My gift is past its "consume by" date, but it should be okay. I appreciate it. This layoff gives you a good chance to sit and think. The real meaning of freedom... is to think for yourself and reach your own conclusion. One that will make you happy. What if I blow my brain without reaching a conclusion? Then is in the hands of the gods. Why not go with it? That's not right. Don't let others make your decisions. You have to do it yourself. Lose your free will, and you lose your humanity. But in the end, is all in the hands of the gods. - What the hell? - Sorry. - Thinking again, are you? - Not really. I think you think too much. About that woman, right? No offense, but be careful. What do you mean? For a while she was hooked up with a fisherman. He went crazy and killed himself. He went and drowned himself. Fishermen don't drown easily. He meant to. There were other men. One man wasn't enough for a monster... who sucked out a man's vital essence and killed him. That's ridiculous. Just idle gossip. You're starting to dry up. Finished for the day? I'll be by at four. What for? To meet my father. I guess I'll have to join you. No you won't. Can I get 1000 yen? A loan? Women earn him money. In here. Here he is. So you want to be a fisherman, eh? I'm Sasano. Pleased to meet you. They are alike. He is Koji's double. Just like I told you. Is like Koji's come back. Who am I like? Koji, a fisherman. Remember I told you? Shorter hair, but he looked like you. When I first saw you, my heart stopped. You're in love with that girl from the sweetshop. Sort of. That's not why I brought him here. We're one man short. Can you afford him? I'll vouch for him. He's a good worker. We're leaving. Just a minute. Be more damn careful! You're absolutely hopeless. I'm sorry. Take care. Old Grandma is still waiting, is she? Waiting? For what? She's always there at the end of the bridge. Waiting for someone? Didn't I tell you? She's waiting for that drifter to return. The murderer? That was years ago. She was a fine looking woman back then. She used to have men fighting over her. How is it? Everything's fixed, we're ready to fish. So the drifter killed the fisherman? Right. There was a carpet of fish that day. What's a "carpet of fish?" It was as if every fish in the Sea of Japan... had gathered here, forming a carpet of fish. I've never seen that. The drifter was up on a number of charges. He got 13 years. She waited for him all that time. But he never came back. He was incapable of understanding a woman's self... esteem. Self... esteem? What's that mean? You're too young to know. When her mind went she began waiting for him again. Enough of these old stories. Does he get the job or not? Because of that woman you'll give up everything? You've got a family, obligations. Not any more, I don't. You haven't decided yet. Come see me again when you're certain. Well, that was a waste of time. That's checkmate. In one move. And a very commonplace move, I must say. What's wrong with it? Is got no pizzazz. I once had a friend who died on top of a woman. He had his hand up between her legs. Now that was rare. Ghosts, non... commonplace ones, tend to be fat. What's wrong with being commonplace? Isn't life like that? Who can say what's rare and what's common? Is it common to vent as much water as she does? How do you know? You love that warm fluid. That's not your concern. Fulfill your desires, that's the way! You side with the commonplace. Imagine being a rook, a knight, or a pawn. Now there's a life for you! Is a good life if it ends well, that's all. But the battle ends when your dick goes limp! Grandma? Come on inside. What's up? Running short of vital essence? I'm okay. Keep a sharp eye out or you'll get hurt. Now heave! Hey, Minister! I'm in the Biwako Marathon. Congratulations! The road to my presidency starts at Biwako. A good coach helps. There's not as much as there was. About half of what it was. Will it continue to lessen? Is all because of you. You're curing me. I've decided to stay for a while. There's no work in Tokyo. I'm so glad! I'm no burglar! A man asked me to get something he left behind. A golden Buddha or something. Anyway, he hid it in a pot he left here. You know about it? What's the matter, Granny? Stop laughing! Is my Taro... in good health? No. He died a while ago. He didn't suffer though. You were Taro's lover, weren't you? He always regretted it. When he was drunk he'd say he wished he had returned. But he couldn't face you. Him being an ex... con and all. So there's no pot of treasure? There is. But is been empty for years. No treasure to be found in this old dump. What's that? Noto silk. Is cool in summer. Is his, you take it. Expensive, isn't it? Are you sure? Is a reward for telling me what became of Taro. May I ask a question? Is that girl upstairs Taro's granddaughter? What's up? I've had enough. I'm heading back to Tokyo. No treasure here and the food's lousy. You be careful. You too. We won't be seeing you back at the camp. I envy old Taro. No woman's going to cry when I die. That was sudden. I'll miss the old bum. Good time, Ramin. You run best when you're hungry. Haven't seen Granny around for a couple of days. Probably given up hope. Did you say something? Is a sad thing to wait all those years. Especially in vain. You always had a thing for her, didn't you? Not just me. You too. She was beautiful. More beautiful than any of the movie stars back then. She was really something. That hurts. Sorry, I can't. Is okay. Don't worry about it. You're probably just tired. But you're a good doctor. You've cured me. So from now on... I'll let you do it whenever you want to. I'll take these. That'll be 1,280 yen. - Do you want a cover? - Please. - Can I borrow your scooter? - Sure. - The key? - Is in there. How come? Damn! Good day! - Cold, isn't it? - Yes, it is. Koji? What's with you and her? You look so much like him! You gave me a fright. What's with you and her? I'm just out of jail, I came to see Koji's old girlfriend. She was wasted on Koji. She's not Koji's any more. She's yours, is she? Yeah. Okay. Then let me be frank with you. She's quite different, isn't she? Her body, I mean. She gushes like a fountain. So Koji told me. Is that true? I know a man who pays well for oddities like that. How's 50,000 yen a night sound? Okay, 80,000. Plus some coke. Before I take her to him, I'll test her out first. - What...? - Stay away from her! You know who you're talking to? This Koji, he owed me money! His woman has to pay me back. I'm taking her anyway. You aren't married to her. Anyway, you'll dump her when you tire of it. I'll kill you first! Stop it! You're too good for him. - Hey, Shin! - Long time no see. You and your drugs are what killed Koji! - Cool it, will ya?! - Fuck off! In trouble again, kid? You're a damn nuisance! Dad... He's got it wrong. I can explain. Let me explain it to you. Is a misunderstanding. Leave that be! You uppity little bastard! Motherfucker! Listen to me! The fishermen you cheated are waiting at the wharf. Shintaro, I've gotta go. He's crazy about her, ain't he? I saw you drive past. You don't trust me. You're all the same. When the water decreases, they accuse me of being unfaithful. That's fucking obvious! What happened to you? Nothing. Divine punishment for doubting you. Okay, I'll tell you. Grandma never sold the shop because she was waiting for a man. He asked me to come here. He hid some treasure here long ago. He wanted me to get it in his place. So that's why you first approached me? Well, I saw you stealing, so I thought... I've heard enough! At first it was true, but once we had a relationship... I didn't care about the treasure any more. Honestly! For you it was just exotic sex... but do you realize how much I suffer? I tried to kill myself many times. It wasn't just sex! Only Grandma understands my agony. She had the water too? That treasure... was in her pot. What a fool! You came all the way here for that? Now you've found it. What do you say? Are you satisfied? Hey! Where are you? Down here. Is all over now. You can go back to your wife. I'm staying here. I've decided. I'm staying. Do what you want. Was Koji so much like me? He was kind to me. You chose me because I look like him? To atone for your sin? That's vicious! Did you bring him here? Don't! Don't come in here. Am I just his substitute? Yes, you are. This place is a womb for you. Koji was a real fisherman. He was nothing like you. You're just a salaried office worker. Can't a salary man love you? You only love the water, my shame! Take a look at the real me! The me without the water. Which is the real you? You're real as you are! No! I can't take it! I love you so much it makes me sick! I love you! Vent my water! Now! I will. I sure will. I'll empty you. You'll run dry. You know yourself is an impossible tale. A funeral at New Year's is hard to pull off. Imagine dying after choking on a rice cake. That's so like Grandma.
