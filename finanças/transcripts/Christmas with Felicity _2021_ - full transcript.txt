-Ugh, after two years. I'm so sorry, Felicity. -Unemployed and bankrupt at Christmas. I feel sick. -You gave it your best. Chicago's a big, hard city. -A failed artist, a failed wedding, and now a failed baker. It's so sad I could laugh, but I just end up crying. -Hang in there, Felicity. We all believe in you up here in Wisconsin. -You all are way too happy. -Mm, well, only room for one moody artist in this family. -How's she doing? -I think she misses her aunt. -That's nice of you to say. I can't eat this. Here, Ginger. And I just maxed out another credit card on comfort food. -Do not get another credit card. -Well, what am I gonna do, Grace? -Mom and Dad would love to have you. -No way. -I mean, I do admit their empty-nest honeymoon phase has gotten worse. -Much worse. -You wouldn't have to pay rent. Aspen Grove at Christmas? I don't think I could stomach it. -What are you saying? There is no better place to be this time of year. -I honestly don't even think I like Christmas anymore. -Okay, now you've crossed a line. You have always loved Christmas. -Well, things change. These last years have been tough. I'm now a Grinch. -Don! Don! You could work at Don's office. The front-desk assistant girl, uh... -Lily. -Lily is going to Prague for a month with her school. I think. -Grace, I cannot work at your husband's office like a teenager. -Lily is not a teenager, and you'd be doing Don a big favor. -She's 19, so technically she's a teenage... Huge. Big deal. Very helpful. -Maybe... -Never mind. -Maybe what? -Maybe I should call Brian. -Are you hearing yourself? You called off the wedding. I went with you when you tried to get a refund on your wedding dress. I sat with you while you cried when they said no. -He was my best friend. I mean, you are, too, but you know what I mean. -You're spiraling. Come home. Work at Don's office for a month. Make some money. Get back to Chicago after Christmas. -Bah, humbug. -Speak for yourself, honey. What choice do you have? -One-month office job? That's it? -One month. For Christmas! -For Christmas. -Mm-hmm. -What are we doing here? -Huh. Come on, Ginger Snap. -Sweetie! -Welcome home! -Oh! -Okay. I can't breathe. -How was the drive? Are you hungry? Thirsty? -Let's get you some eggnog. -No. Mom, Dad, let's get one thing straight. I just want to work and make plans to start over. I appreciate you letting me stay, and I love you. But I want as little Christmas as humanly possible. -Oh, sweetheart, you've got... -Oh. Mm. -Well, I'll just have to help you. I wish you would. -Felicity! Oh! -I'm glad you're back. -I'm not so sure I am. -It's a good thing. Just in time for a Christmas miracle. I know. I'm kidding. No holiday magic allowed. -Aunt Felicity! -Maddie, look at you! You're so grown-up now. -Really? -We are heading to the farmers' market. Do you want to come? Or are we still in a mood? -I can be in a mood and still go to the farmers' market. -That's the most she's talked to anyone in weeks. -I feel like I get along well with sullen teenagers. I can't imagine why. -Ha, ha, ha, ha! -So, Maddie's all grown-up. When did that happen? -Ugh, overnight. She is just like you. -Well, isn't she lucky? I remember when I wanted to move to Chicago and paint. Take on the world. -Well, didn't you? -This has been a blast. I'm gonna go grab a coffee and sit in the car. -Absolutely not. You need fresh air and small-town festivities. And Maddie loves Christmas in Aspen Grove. Don't you? Yeah, she tries to play it cool. -I like Christmas... cookies. -That is exactly what we need. -Yeah, but why do they have to be Christmas cookies? Couldn't they just be cookies or cookies you eat during the winter season? -Let's go and leave Lady Scrooge ... or was it Lady Grinch? -Both. -To figure out Christmas on her own. -Hi, you! Oh! Who put this monstrosity on you? We're done with Christmas. -Done with Christmas? We're just getting started. -Excuse me, that was a private conversation. -With Pumpkin? He's being oppressed by Christmas. -Oppressed? It's the best time of year. Come on, have some cocoa. It's on the house. Well, it's on the farm. -Excuse me. What are you doing with my Pumpkin? -Oh, nothing. Sorry. -Pumpkin, come here. -Tried to tell her. -I couldn't be mad at you, though, could I, James? -Right. Well, sorry again. -Don't you want your cocoa? It's the season and all that. -Yeah, it's not really my season. Not this year, anyways. -I don't believe it. -Don't believe what? -You're Felicity Olson. -Caitlin Rogers? -So you're back in town? -Um, just visiting. I don't think I've seen you since you and Grace graduated high school. Uh, how have you been? -Fantastic. I'm town chairwoman, which means that I'm responsible for making sure that all of this runs smoothly. Grace told me about the wedding. What a shame. -Caitlin, you would know. Where is Mrs. Rockwell's cookie stand? -Oh, you haven't heard. Mrs. Rockwell retired. She lives in Florida now. -Seriously? -Oh! -She fell in love with Arnold Hollingsworth. One day, he started sitting in the window seat at the coffee shop. -Which was Mrs. Rockwell's seat. So she started sitting with him, and they fell in love. -Oh, that is so romantic. -So lame. -It's true. -Boca Raton is lucky. No more Mrs. Rockwell's Christmas cookies for us. -Sound the alarm. Just a bit of holiday humor, -Felicity, I understand that this may not be important to someone like you, but in a small town, tradition matters. Now if you'll excuse me, I see a pair of wooden angels that are about to go up in flames next to that candle display. -Caitlin saves the day. -James, talk soon about the Snow Ball. -Christmas cookies. -No. No. I'm in mourning. -My sister's a baker. -Was a baker. -You could save Christmas. -People can bake their own cookies. -Yes, but what about all the town events and the hardworking folks who don't have time to bake and ... and who want something to bring to parties, to school, to ... to church? Maddie! -Um, cinnamon rolls. Bûche de Noel? -It's a golden opportunity here. -Okay, I've decided I'm leaving. Goodbye. It was nice to meet you. -Please excuse my sister. She is not in the Christmas spirit yet. -Ooh, it is a quick transition after Thanksgiving. -Yeah, maybe that's it. -Felicity, this is James. James was varsity quarterback. He was a bit of a star. -I don't think I knew what a football was back then. -Oh, it's a brown ball, sort of spheroid. -Oh, I thought that was the baseball. -Uh, two cocoas. None for Felicity. -Felicity, your name means happiness, right? -Oh, also joy, cheer, delight. Everything my sister embodies. -Ha. -Well, lots of felicity around the holiday could be a good thing. -Oh, can I get a quart of milk and three pounds of butter? -Three pounds? -It's Christmas. Time to bake cookies to eat during the "winter season." -I see what you did there, Grace. -All right. Later, Maddie. Nice to meet you, Felicity. -What is wrong with this town? It's like everyone's under a spell. -You'll be under it, too, soon enough. -I'll be back in Chicago soon enough. -Wanna bet? -So, after we log in, we have to access the patient-records library. To do this, we click... ...the PDF and... drag it over... to the patient's name. And let's see, where is it? -I've got it. -I tend to do all of my inputs after lunch. Oh, did you put your name on your lunch? -No, I didn't. I guess I assumed that sandwich in the fridge was just named Susan. Sorry, that was a bad joke. I'll just go write my name on my food. That is too funny. A sandwich named Susan. -Yeah, I thought it was weird, you guys all naming your food like that, but you know, every office has its quirks. -If you knew Susan, you'd know why what you said is so funny. -Can't wait to meet her. -Oh! Oh, a salad... A salad named Jamal. A soup named Benjamin. -Okay, so that PDF that you were talking about ... -A smoothie named Ken. -You laugh, but that joke went on for eight hours. -Hey, beggars can't be choosers. -Okay, I am grateful for the job. I can just see myself going insane. -Did Felicity tell you what a smashing success she was today? A burrito named Don. Oh, a new classic. Ready for movie night? -Yep. See you in there. -We're watching "It's a Wonderful Life." You're baking. -Mom's shortbread recipe. Whoops. -That's the best whoops I've ever heard. Does this mean ... -Hey, hey. What's the hold-up? Oh, Christmas cookies. Nice. May I? -Mmm! -Oh, my. They just melt in our ... -Salty but buttery. -Yet sweet. This is the best... -Christmas cookie I've ever had. -I mean, I knew you were good, but these are insane. Who are you? -She's the new Mrs. Rockwell. -What does that mean? -It means, Don... I quit. -And I have the perfect gig for you to get started. We're talking high-profile. -Cocoa delivery. Am I late? Hey, Maddie. -Made it just in time. Sugarplum fairies are about to wrap it up. -Good. Had to finish up a few things at the farm. -Oh, I forgot, everyone here is on Aspen Grove Time. -Sure looks like you found your holiday spirit. -Well, there is an opening in the marketplace. I'm making money. I'm thrilled. Ho, ho, ho, et cetera. -That's very Christmassy of you. -What's more Christmassy than rampant consumerism wrapped in a warm blanket of butter and sugar? -So there is no room for Christmas magic. You are just all business. -You say that like it's a bad thing. -I mean, it's a little... Never mind. -It's what? -It's a little... cynical. And maybe that's a strong word, but it's ... -It's realistic. If that's being cynical, then so be it. But I plan to do very well this season. I have to. -So, how'd the butter work out for you? -Fine. -Best butter in the state. Looks like it inspired you. -I inspire myself. -Then you won't mind if I try one? -Those are for sale. Besides, I thought you were Mr. Humble Christmas-Loving Farmer Man. -Okay, what is wrong with loving Christmas? -Nothing. It's very innocent and small-town. It's sweet. -It's innocent because nobody in Chicago loves Christmas. Everybody's too busy being... chic. -Are you calling me chic? Chic and cynical? Wow, I sound very French. Thank goodness I left Aspen Grove. -Hey, this is my town, and it's your town, too. -Please. I wouldn't live here again if somebody paid me to. -Isn't that exactly what's happening here? -So, how did everybody do? -Sold out. -Oh, that's too bad. I would have loved to taste-test. -She's even better than she used to be. -What? Used to be? -Must be James' butter. -It's definitely not the butter. It's all technique. What do you mean, "used to be"? -Not in a bad way. -Well, we all grow and change over the years. -Especially when we get back to our innocent, small-town butter. -I still remember how you were in middle school. Braces, glasses. You hardly said a word back then. Grace's awkward little sister, the artsy one. How things change. Let me be a shining example of how middle school does not define you. -You're gonna do great, Maddie. -It does plant seeds for the future. After all, I was class president. -Yeah, you got the school to buy those extra vending machines. -With no help from anyone, I might add. If I had a campaign slogan, it would have been, "Never mind, I'll do it myself." -Always impressive, Caitlin. And you didn't get any hot cocoa this evening. Don't worry. I'll wear you down. Evening, artsy ladies. Felicity, good luck. -Thanks. -Let me help you with that. -Thank you kindly. -You're my hero. You know that? Being 13 is the worst. -Tell me about it. -You really think my baking's gotten better? -I-I didn't mean to ... -No, that's okay. It's good feedback. Not everyone will give you an honest opinion. I do think James' butter had something to do with it. But if you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it. -Got it. -And disown you. -My lips are sealed. -So, how busy are 13-year-olds these days? -I don't know. What? What?! -Okay, hold it straight up and down. Perfect. Look at that. You're a natural. -Everybody ready? Look at you two little elves. -Look what Aunt Felicity showed me. -That's pretty cool, Mad. -Ready to get a tree? -I got plenty of rope to tie it up and a Thermos full of Carol's delicious eggnog. -Don's out front. He actually likes that stuff. -Let's wrap this up, Maddie. -Okay. -There's a happy kid. -What did you put in those cookies? -Christmas magic. -All right, let's go. -I know. -How come we don't get to go to the Schumachers'? I've never been here. -They retired. -Hey, guys, wait up. Christmas trees. Smells like childhood. -You guys are slow! -Hold your horses! -Oh, you're kidding. -Hey, folks, -What's he doing here? -Anderson Family Farm. -He sells the trees, too? Ugh! -Right, ugh. A kind, good-looking farmer milks the cows, makes the cocoa, sells the trees. He's the worst. -I was kind of a crab last night. -Oh, I'm shocked. -Well, he, like, loves Christmas way more than most guys. It's weird. -Only you would make that a bad thing. -Caitlin Rogers seems pretty interested. -Aw! Can you blame her? -I don't remember him from school. -You were too... -Moody? -...preoccupied with your future as an artist. -This one's nice. -And he was too focused on going pro. -Really? -It's like a... -Do you like him? -I mean, I don't like like him. I'm moving back to Chicago as soon as possible, and happy-go-lucky farmers can stay in Wisconsin. -Okay. Look at these trees! -Ooh, this one's perfect. -Fraser fir ... that is my favorite. -That's a tall one, Mad. I think I'll need to put the angel up. -No way! You can still lift me. -Somebody get lost? -Did you make these? -I did. -They're beautiful, actually. -That is the first compliment you've given me, so... I'll take it. -Well, I have guilt over being a Cookie Monster last night. I'm sorry about that. -I am sorry, too. I can get defensive about my butter. It's my life's work you're talking about. -Well, your life's work seems to be just the ticket to getting my life's work off the ground. -So the lady wants more? -The lady requires about 30 pounds of butter. -Well, you have come to the right place. -Anyway, I, um... I need to bake my head off if I'm gonna get out of Aspen Grove in January. -Sure. Let's get you and your humbug attitude out of here. -Exactly. Whoa. -Uh... It's a ... It's a weed. Uh, mistletoe. -Oh. -Figured I would...sell it. -That's ... That's a good side business. -It's not just a side business, it's ... it's also fun. -I'm gonna get out ... I'm gonna go. -Get you that butter! -Okay, we've got a permit for the farmers' market. Now comes the fun part. -Candy? -Candy. -Wait. Look. -Well, we're not sampling. We're doing quality control. -Mmm. -Excuse me. What are you doing? -Quality control? -There are no samples. -My aunt is an amazing baker, and she's gonna have a booth at the farmers' market. We're looking for candy to use in the recipes. -Wait. Are you Felicity Olson? -Yes. Why? Did we go to high school together, too? -No. You baked cookies for the dance recital the other night. They were amazing. -Thank you. -Which ones were your favorite? Market research. -This girl's gonna run the world someday. -Well, I'm old-fashioned, so definitely the sugar cookies. Are you planning to open a storefront? -No. -Not yet. Right. She's just visiting. -Do you bake bread? -Sourdough, country loaf, pumpkin, you name it. -What about croissants? -Chocolate, pistachio, or butter? -Cakes? -If it can be baked, I can bake it. -We've been in need of a good bakery ever since Mrs. Rockwell left. -So I've heard. -Look, Aspen Grove is a good market... if you can figure it out. Mrs. Rockwell was my biggest customer, and I sent a lot of folks her way. It's one of the best parts of small-town life. We help each other. But lately, things have... slowed down. -That's too bad. -You're never alone in a town like Aspen Grove. That's what my parents taught me. This was their store. It would break my heart to close. -Maybe if you allowed samples, you'd have better word-of-mouth. -Madison! -No, you're right. It's probably time to update that policy. -I am interested in getting a sense of what you have. Maybe there's a way we can work together. -Well, we don't do samples. But we can do, uh, what was it? Quality control? Look, if I'm being honest, I do quality control every day. -Okay, I'll take them. -Which ones? -All of them. -Oh! -Wonderful. Really? -Yes. Oh, I also need some bulk chocolate nibs ... 60 percent. -What's the name of your business? For the order form. -Oh, I don't know if I have one anymore. My bakery in Chicago was called Ginger Snaps, but... -What about Aspen Grove Bakery? -Too generic. Felicity's Cookies? -But you bake more than just cookies. -Right. Felicity's Christmas Treats? -Christmas Treats by Felicity? -Too many words. -What about Christmas with Felicity? -Christmas with Felicity. -Thank you. Merry Christmas. -Thank you so much. Here you go. -Thank you so much. Enjoy! -Awesome. Hey there, Pumpkin. Should I introduce you to my ginger? -Did you just ask that dog a question? -Yes. -Bless you. -Thank you. Oh, glad to see you and your niece have gotten into the Christmas spirit. -Well, 'tis the season. Cookie? -Can I try one? -Oh, this is Brenda. She is a Snow Ball volunteer. -And her cousin. -Mmm! These are really good. -We added lemon zest and cardamom. -Wonderful. But we don't have time. -Stressed? -Well, we have the Snow Ball ... that's the yearly town party ... in less than two weeks. We need decorations that aren't ready yet, a DJ who, for no reason, won't return my calls, and a catering company that isn't e-mailing me in a timely manner. What do you think? -Sounds like a big deal. It is. Everybody's getting dressed up. -And desserts. -Really? -And now this. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the board didn't receive your permit to sell at the Christmas fair. -Oh, well, I definitely submitted my permit. -That was for the farmers' market. This is the Christmas fair. -They look the same to me. When did that happen? -This morning? Today. Today is the first day of the Christmas fair. -Oh. Can I get a permit? -Sure. -Great. -For next year. This year is full up, and it's too late. -But I'm here. I have a stand. -These are really good. -Felicity, this is a carefully constructed fair. Now, I know you've been enjoying making money off the holidays and baking your little cookies, but you're not authorized to be here. You'll have to leave. -But ... -It gives me no pleasure. But that's the final word on the matter. -What do we do now? -I hate this town. I hate making my favorite thing into a business. I hate Christmas. -Looks like Brian is spending Christmas with his parents in Evanston. That makes sense. -It's strange, not having him around this year. You talk to him much lately? Aww! You used to love this one. -Oh, yeah, the angel with the trumpet. -I recall you and Grace almost breaking that one during a fight. -Sweetie, how are you? -I'm tired, Mom. -I'm sure you are. -I tried so hard in Chicago, and it didn't work. And now it's like I'm just repeating myself here. It's like I'm on a failure loop. And I lost Brian. -Now, you broke up with him, isn't that right? He wasn't supportive? -He was when we started. But I pushed him away. I don't know, I just ... I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it. -It's hard to start a business. -Yeah, but at least I had someone. Now I'm all alone. All I have is Ginger. -Sorry, Ginger Snap. -You know, a lot of businesses fail in the first year. The fact that you made it two is impressive. -Thanks, Dad. -Hello, my dears. -As a person who mopes, I can say this. You're moping. -I'm not moping. -You are moping. It's annoying. -Don't ruin Christmas for everybody. -Okay, harsh. Do you feel this way, too? Wow, okay, not only did I ruin my relationship and my business, but my incessant moping is ruining Christmas for everyone. I should have just stayed in Chicago and moped in peace. You've got to stop. Try something new. Look what Maddie did. -Social media... and a website, too. -This looks really good. -There's an order form and everything. You don't need the stand at the Christmas fair. -You don't need a permit from anyone. -I've tried this online-business thing. I couldn't keep up with it while running the actual business. There's just too much. -You just need some help. -I know you feel alone, darling, but you do have more than just Ginger. -You have us. -Oh, I don't know how to accept this. -It's done! Accept. -And hire me as your PR and social-media manager. -Yeah, you need someone on your level. -Okay. Let's do it. -Good... because I already got you another gig. -Already? -Question. How do you feel about good-looking farmers? -My tree is set up in my room with my favorite ornaments. It's magical. Thank you. -I'm so glad. I'll see you in there. You're a lifesaver. -Saving lives with cookies. What was that about? -We had some spare branches from the farm, so we put Charlie Brown Christmas trees in all the rooms. -Are you a real person? -What? -Nothing. It's just really nice. -Anyway, I guess Mrs. Rockwell used to supply desserts to tonight's party every year. Looks like they didn't get the memo she left town. -I appreciate the work. -Oh, you're glad to see me, too. -No. I mean... -Money, money, money. I-I know. I know. Do you need to take that? -Uh, no. Let's set up. -Okay. -Oh, no, don't please. You're too nice. -Oh, yeah, here. Just kidding. Maybe I am too nice. -That's an awful lot to choose from. My wife used to make these. Pretzels for antlers. -Did she really? Sounds like a fun lady. -It's a hard time of year to miss someone. -It is. Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas to you. -I never know if I'm saying the right thing. -You're doing pretty good. Can I introduce you to someone? -James, you've thrown another wonderful party. -Grandma, this is Felicity. -Pleased to meet you. I'm Nora. -Lovely to meet you. -James told me you baked these cookies. They're remarkable. -She should know. She gave Mrs Rockwell her first job as a baker. -Of course, she wasn't Mrs. Rockwell then. She was just Bonnie. -That is an honor, then. Thank you. -Did you go to culinary school? -Actually, I went to art school. -Really? -Really. But after I graduated, I got a job at a bakery to pay the rent, and I fell in love with it. -Art for the taste buds. -That's right. -Do you have a new bakery here in town? I'm sure you're successful. -No, I live in Chicago now. Uh, my bakery... Well, we had to close. -So, uh, what are you doing here now? -Well, I guess this is the part where I'm getting back on my feet. -Sometimes, trying again is even harder than just starting out. -Yeah, I think you're right. -You're polite with me, but I can tell you're a fighter. Takes one to know one. And James knows something about hard times. -She doesn't want to hear about that. -But he has put such dedicated work into the farm. He's made us proud. -Yeah, I can see that. -Hey, thanks again. You made her week. I didn't realize you've been going through all that. -Oh, it's okay. -With that and the wedding, it must be... I'm sorry. Grace mentioned. -Grace always mentions it. It's no big deal. Hey, thanks again. It was really nice to bake for people who actually appreciate it. -So you're gonna have a booth at the Christmas fair tomorrow night, right? -Nope. Caitlin wouldn't give me a permit. No permit, no booth. -Caitlin is a stickler for the rules. -You think? -But... I have a booth. Who's to say I can't sell dessert? -No, I can't let you do that. -We've been a success twice. We should team up again. -Okay. Okay, in the spirit of letting people help me, which I'm trying to be better at... count me in. -Great! Business partners. -Kiss! Kiss. -Uh... I hung that. Sorry. -It's a weed, right? -Uh, yeah. Yeah, it's a ... it's a weed. -It's tradition! -You can do better than that. -Uh... -Okay, I'm gonna ... I'll see you later. -See you later, Felicity. -Hey, sweetie. -Hey, Mom, Dad. -You're in a good mood this morning. -Yeah, I guess I am. Something about a fresh snowfall. I see you two playing footsie, by the way. Reminds me of Christmas morning. -Oh, every year, a tangerine at the bottom of your stocking. Your grandmother did it, too. -I'm gonna borrow these to make something ... gingerbread with tangerine essence and peel. Dipped in chocolate? -Mm, shaped like stockings. -Love it. Do not love it. -What is it? -Look at how many orders I have. -Oh, my. That's a good problem. -And I'm doing the cookies for the Christmas fair tonight. I'm gonna faint. -No, you're not. We're here for you. -We are. -Wow! -That's a lot of orders. -You just tell us what to do, kiddo. -Okay, everybody, smile! -Hello. -Felicity? -Brian. How are you? -Good. I'm, uh... It's good to hear your voice. -You, too. Sorry about that. -Having a good time? -Actually, I am. You? -Well, I was on a break at work, just wasting some time online, and I saw some amazing cookies come up in my feed. Beautiful photos, a great, great website. -Business is booming. -It looks like it, yeah. I'm proud of you. -I'm proud of me, too. Oh, that was corny. -No, no, no, no. It's good to hear you laugh again. I know it's been hard. -Well, your name was on the wedding invites, too, remember? -Oh, I remember. -I can't tell what you're thinking. -I'm thinking, I miss you. -I miss you, too. But we shouldn't ... -I miss you cooking dinner. I miss that spot of flour on your cheek at the end of the day. I wonder, uh, maybe... -Felicity! How do you want to display the snickerdoodles? -I should go. Um... We have so many orders, it's ridiculous. But wonderful. -Yeah. Okay. Uh... can we talk again soon? -Yeah. Okay. Um, I got to go. -Okay. Uh, bye. -Bye. -Almost finished. I'm gonna need coffee. -Just wait. Look. New orders. -Good news travels fast. -Thank you so much. I'm not used to this. It's been really... -We're glad you're back, too. -So, Brian called. Twice. -Why? -Don't be mad. -I'm not mad, I'm just... I'm protective. -Brian is a good man. -Brian wants to be a good man. -Well, his intentions are good. He's made a few mistakes in the execution. -I still love him. I think I always will. -Of course you will. -But how did you know that Don was the one for you? -It was not in the big gesture, the way you see in the movies. It was really.. ordinary. I had just gone back to work, and I was new at the office. And he was this cute, nerdy doctor. I was rushing because I was nervous, and I was carrying all these forms and a coffee. And I ran right into him, and I dropped my coffee ... splat, on the floor. It was a mess. But as I was cleaning it up, I just remember him bending down and saying, "Can I get you a new coffee? How do you like it?" And I knew. -Well, that's a completely boring story. -Well, not to me. 'Cause I remember his face. And I remember thinking, "That's the man you're gonna spend the rest of your life with." I was shocked. I did not see it coming. You know, Felicity, you've always wanted things in the extreme ... big city, the painting studio... a bakery, perhaps before you were ready. -Hey! -It's not a bad thing. But there is so much to be found in the simple things. There is magic everywhere, even in Aspen Grove. You just have to open your eyes to it. -Evening, folks. Ready to warm up? -Two cocoas, please. -And two vanilla shortbread cookies. -Absolutely. -We've been trying to figure it out, but what do you put in your cocoa? -Definitely cinnamon. -Definitely. But what else? -Don't look at me. I still haven't tried it. -It's Christmas cheer. -Fine. Keep your secrets. -Merry Christmas. -Well, this is all gorgeous. You two should take a walk and check it out. -Grace, your sister has never had my cocoa. -Have you had any of my cookies? -You hit me the last time I tried. Oh-ho, I am not falling for that again. -What? You can't sell if you don't know what the goods taste like. So do a taste test and take a walk. Go! -After you. -And that, dear, is how it's done. -Let's get some cookies. -Just one. -Oh, hey, Caitlin. Have you been able to enjoy the fair? -Yes, Daniel was willing to put up with his mom for an evening, and I'll take whatever I can get. -I understand. Maddie's gotten into working with her aunt, so I have been lucky to see more of her lately. -You decorated these? -Some of them. -Cool. -Speaking of which, is Felicity...? -Oh, she's just on break. Get her mind off that ex-fiancé of hers. And James is so sweet, right? -He is. -I do feel bad, though, about the whole permit thing. -Yeah. Cait, you got to loosen up. I know you're overwhelmed, but it's the holidays. -Right? Right. I shouldn't have been so hard on Felicity. Is she, um... still mourning about the wedding, you think? -She thinks she is. Keeps talking about Brian. She's had a hard year. But I say, rock bottom is a blessing. In with the new. -Brian ... rock bottom. Got it. -So, which cookie's got your eye? -I'll take a snowman. -And I'll do a brownie. Wow, that's good! Peppermint? -Genius, right? -Okay. Sorry I waited. This is the best hot cocoa I've ever had. -Cayenne. -Really? -Yeah, just a pinch. -That's not very Wisconsin of you. -No, no. Something I got from my teammate's aunt. -Hmm, you're changing my whole perspective on football players. -But these cookies ... I could get fat on these. -All that innocent butter. -No, I can just tell you know what you're doing 'cause I have never had anything like this around here. -That's big-city French bakery training for you. Layers of unsalted butter, room-temperature eggs, creaming the butter and sugar just right so the sugar crystals perfectly aerate the butter. It's scientific, but also an art. -You miss your bakery, huh? -I used to wake up at 4:00 a.m. every morning just to roll out cookie dough and bread loaves. Take the rolls out of the oven for the die-hard early customers. I was so proud of it. For a while. -What happened, if you don't mind? -Well, it wasn't the baking. Never was. I just didn't know what I needed to know as a new business owner, if ... if that makes sense. -It does. -It was so expensive. At the same time, my relationship was falling apart. I couldn't pay rent. Brian had just made partner, and he would come by the bakery after work, and he'd be in a suit, and I'd be on the kitchen floor covered in flour, crying. When did it get so complicated? When I was younger, I used to think that you would just fall in love, and that would be enough. So stupid. Real life isn't romantic at all. -I'm not buying that. -Not buying what? -I think you do believe that life is romantic. You might even believe in Christmas cheer and all that other corny stuff. But you're telling yourself you don't, that you're above it. -Why would I do that? -Maybe because sometimes second chances hurt. They can be even harder than starting out for the first time. -Wait a minute, did you just quote your grandma? -No. -You so did! -I'd be more embarrassed if she wasn't right all the time. -Why do you love Christmas so much? -Oh, you think it's funny, a guy would like Christmas this much? -No. I mean, a little. -Well, we did miss each other in high school. -You would have never liked me, by the way. -Oh, I don't know about that. I think you would have intimidated me. You may not know this, but after graduation, I went right into college ball and was slated to go pro, get snatched up pretty quickly. -What happened? -That's where my luck ran out. I got knocked down, like everybody does, but I hit my head too many times. Got a few concussions. And the last one I had was the final practice before Christmas. I got knocked out cold. It was terrifying. My mom tells me it was terrifying, I mean. Uh, all I remember is waking up on Christmas morning. My family had slept at the hospital. My parents, grandma, brother and sister. The room was just decorated. There were lights and a tree in the corner. Mom was crying. My grandma, she was crying. My dad, he was trying not to cry. Every Christmas since then... I just feel really grateful to celebrate the holiday. To try and make the world just a little bit happier. -You're... -What? -You're different than I thought you were. -So are you. -I think I'm starting to see why you like Christmas so much. -I like Christmas so much. -What are you doing? -Listening to it. -What's it telling you? -That it's done. -You're awfully chipper. Did you have a nice walk last night? Enjoy some Christmas carols? Sample some hot chocolate? -So what if I did? -Look at little miss "I hate Christmas." All star-eyed. -Can I help? -You want to remove that cake from its round? -Sure thing. -Ow! Oh! Ow, ow, ow, ow! I'm sorry. -Not so graceful, are we, Grace? -How rude. -Don't worry about it. I'll just bake another one. This is cute. -Yeah, I like that. -For your mom? -I think she has that one already. -What is one more reindeer? -Oh, Aunt Felicity? Can you pick up something and pose? I want to show you being normal and shopping. -Being normal? -You know what I mean. For the socials. We need to populate the pages. Smile! And who's that for? -No one. I just picked it up 'cause you told me to. -But we have to tell a story. Right. Um... -People will respond more if there's an emotional connection. They want to know why you're buying it. Like, is it for someone special? -Someone special? -I mean, we can make it up or whatever, but we don't want to lie, so it's a balance. -Let's just say it's for your grandpa. That's someone special, right? -Not James? -That's a can of worms I can't deal with yet. -But you are gonna get him something, right? -Maybe. But don't post that. -Why? -I can't put my feelings out into the world. It's too soon, and what if somebody sees it? -Like James? -Or Brian. I don't want to blindside him at Christmas. I'll let him know in my own time. -Okay, so it's for Grandpa. Aunt Felicity... how do you know if a boy likes you? -You're asking me? -Well, you do have two boys that like you right now. Okay, fair enough. Well, the first question I would ask is, do you like this boy? -I don't know. -But maybe, right? -Yeah, but I don't want to like him if he doesn't like me. -Yeah, that's the hard part, because you got to put yourself out there, and that might mean you could get hurt. But if you don't, you might miss out on the chance at being really happy. -Okay. -There are ways that you can tell, though, like... does he listen to you? Do you feel like you can be yourself around him? -This is stressful. -Tell me about it. But it's like you were saying ... it's a balancing act between protecting yourself and putting yourself out there. -Thanks. Sometimes it's hard to talk to my mom about this stuff. -Sure. I mean, what are aunts for? -Are you actually gonna buy that for grandpa? -Well, I don't want to be a liar on the social. -Sharon, I don't care if your daughter has the plague. I need those cupcakes in two days. Don't bother me until they're done. -Peppermint mocha for Felicity. -Caitlin, hi. -Festive drink order. -I feel like I'm getting into the holiday season, finally. Oh, your cousin Brenda ordered cookies. If you see her, tell her they'll be ready tomorrow. -Well, you'll have to tell her yourself. She quit. -Oh, I'm sorry. Like I said, never mind, I'll do it myself. -But the Snow Ball's coming together? -Amazingly. Couldn't be better. -Great. Well, my family and I are planning on being there. So good luck with everything. Really. -Bless you. -Triple-shot gingerbread latte. -Hi, baby. Making friends out here? What's gotten into...? You. -Felicity. -Good morning. I did not mean to startle you. -Let me get that. -Thank you. -Can I get you a new coffee? -How do you like it? -Hello? -Um, Brian, what are you doing here? -Brian? -James, this is Brian. Brian, this is James. -Nice to meet you. -I'm sorry, who are you? -Um, James sells the incredible butter I use in my cookies. -Fantastic. The local supplier. -Brian, listen ... -I know. I know it's a surprise, but let me take you to lunch. -I-I-I have so much to do. -Oh, come on. You've got to eat. It's so good to see you. -James, I-I'm sorry. I need to... I'll see you later? -Of course, yeah. -It was nice to meet you, man. -James. -Right. Come on, Ginger. She missed me. -So, now you've met the fiancé. -Ex-fiancé. -Well, not quite. Last night, Grace was telling me that Felicity has been talking about him the whole time she's been back. Well, I mean, of course, I'm sure you can tell that Grace has been trying to push Felicity on you. -You don't... They're not... back together? -Oh, yeah, she's stuck on him. And who can blame her? Successful lawyer. But I'm sure you gave her a huge confidence boost when she needed it most? Nice guy like you. -Bless you. -Thank you. See? Nice. -I almost forgot how this town goes all out for the holiday. I think I saw a snowman-building contest. -Isn't it great? -I guess you got to find something to do in a town this small. -Well, I kind of like it. -Well, let's cut to the chase. -Always a lawyer. -Well, I'm ... I'm nervous. -No, don't be. -It's just me. -Yeah, it's just you. I miss you. You miss me. Chicago misses you. -I doubt that. -It's so good to see you. -You, too. I've been thinking about you. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. Now you're here, and I have to say, it's kind of strange. -I get that. But hear me out. I was wrong not to believe in you when I had the chance. -Thank you. -I mean, you're blowing up. -Yeah, I am. -I always knew you could do more when you put your mind to it. -I seem to remember you making that point clear. -Right, uh ... -Before work. After work. After that party at the Shadducks'. -I had a huge case I was dealing with at that time. -And you were embarrassed by me at that dinner. -No, that's not accurate. -You had just made partner, and you laughed at my sales figures in front of everyone. -It was some gentle mocking. I wanted you to be better. I-Isn't that what loving someone is? Seeing the best in them? -But it wasn't for a lack of trying. I needed help. If I could start over and go back, I would do things the way I'm doing it now, from the ground up, but with you, it always felt like I was chasing your approval. -It kills me because I never, ever meant for it to come off like that. You argue a lot more than you used to. -I learned from the best. -Listen, I have it on pretty good authority that there's a storefront in Lincoln Park near the office that would be perfect for a bakery. -I can't afford that yet. -I can help you. Pay for professional marketing, whatever you need. -So what? I set up shop in a place that you like in a neighborhood that you approve of, now that I have this online following, now that I'm a success? -Exactly. -What about you and me? -We can give it another go. I mean, you've ... you've grown so much. -Now that you're proud of me? -You were floundering. It was so hard before. You were unhappy. -That's when you fight for the other person. I helped you pay your bills during law school by baking. -I know that. You don't have to bring it up. -I loved you when you were struggling, and when the tables were turned, you laughed at me. -And I said I was sorry. -What am I even doing here? This is why we broke up. -Felicity. You're making a scene. -I have to go. -Felic... -Lost your number. James. -Hey. -Hey. I wanted to explain to you about earlier. -That was your fiancé, wasn't it? -Brian is not ... -How sweet of him to drive in from the city to see you. -Yeah, well, I wanted to explain to you about ... -There's no need to explain. I just... I don't want to hear any more about this guy. -Okay. -I thought something was happening here or... I'm not interested in ... in this. -Okay, got it. -I'm glad you're feeling better and you're all set to get out of Aspen Grove. I think you're just... -You think I'm what? -Doesn't matter. Look, I'm a nice guy. Sure, but there's a line. You called off your wedding six months ago. You're not ready to move on yet. -Okay, got it. I thought you were being nice to me. I thought you liked me, but you're actually just nice to everybody. James ... everybody's best friend. But it's just a cover because you're afraid to commit. -I'm nice. I am a nice guy. But I'm not a fool. -Okay, no. Thank you, but please stop. -What? -Where's Maddie? She's so much better at this. -I miss the Christmas Felicity, back when you lived up to your name. -Look, you want to help? Order forms, boxes, cookies. You know the drill. Thank you! -This really is impressive. Do you think you've made enough to move back to Chicago? -I think so. I mean, I don't have a future here. -You mean you don't have a future with James. I haven't seen you so happy in years. You should talk to him. -He's right. I wasn't fair to him. Six months after calling off a wedding? I blew it. I wish I could blame Brian, but it's me. It's always been me, standing in my own way. -Well, at least you've come to your senses. -Enlightenment is a blast. It's not too late, you know? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve. There's time for a last-minute miracle. -Grace, please. I'm so tired of Christmas. I just wanted to survive the holidays without falling apart, and here I am again. -Mom! Aunt Felicity! -Hey, who's this? -Oh, this is Daniel. -Where Madison has been instead of cookie decorating. -Mom! Thanks for ratting me out. -See? Everyone gets their priorities confused between romance and work. -You have to come. My mom ... -She's losing it. Sorry. -Maddie! -What? That's what's happening. -Who's your mom? -You're not gonna like the answer to that one. -Mom, I brought back-up. -No, I don't want your help. -Uh, too late. What's going on? -All of the volunteers have given up, and everyone who said they were gonna bake cookies have... have quit. I guess I'm not very good with people. -Oh, no. -Who would say that? -Please. I'm just trying to make everything beautiful and perfect. And I'm so tired. -Listen, Caitlin! That Christmas you see in magazines or... -Social media. -It doesn't exist. Christmas is just a bunch of imperfect people getting together and doing their best to celebrate life. -It's just, ever since Daniel's dad and I got divorced, I've been pushing so hard. -You're doing great. -Why are you being so nice to me? -Because I've been where you are, and when I needed help, people stepped in. -What is it? -I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have told James that you were getting back together with your ex. -You what? -Please don't hate me. -No. I don't hate you. I just... It makes sense. -I mean, you just show up here, lost and broke, all, "Oh, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'll just bake cookies, I guess. And I'm so pretty and angry and interesting because I live in Chicago." -Okay, that's one take on the situation. -Nobody helps me do anything. And then you come here and you push people away, and then they help you, and you don't even have to ask. I mean, how do you do that? -Honestly, I have no idea, but you're totally right. -And you were rude to James, and he just liked you more. -How can we help you? -Can you say that part about James again? -I just get lonely sometimes. I'm so sorry that I've been so... -Caitlin, how can we help? -Are you serious? -You have to let people in sometimes. I had to learn that, too. -And what better time than at Christmas? -Well. I guess James has the pine-bough decorations, but the lights aren't up, the stage isn't set, and I have no drinks ready and no desserts. -Okay. We're in emergency mode. Operation Snow Ball. Don't roll your eyes at me. This is big, people. Let's get to work. -Mmm! Whoo! Carol, you have really outdone yourself with this eggnog! The belle of the ball! -Oh, stop. -Oh! Think you can make room on your dance card for me? -Always. -All right, you two lovebirds. Let's go. -Oh sweetheart, you look lovely. -Oh, thanks, Mom. But look at you. -You're both beautiful! Look at me, I'm all hopped up on Christmas cheer. -What did you put in his nog, mom? -Come here. We have loved having you home, darling. -Aww, thanks, Dad. And I was wondering, if it's not too big of a pain, if Ginger and I stayed through New Year's? -Not at all. We'd love to have you. -Does this mean you're staying in Aspen Grove? -Yeah, I guess it does. -Oh, our family all together in the same town. We couldn't be happier. -Well, I promise I won't stay too long. I know you two like your privacy. -Mm, that's true, we do. -Little bit. Yeah, we do. -All right, I get it. You're in love. Knock it off. Let's go. -I feel like I got my sister back. The one who loved Christmas so much and believed anything was possible. I missed her. -Well, who knew that having your heart broken and losing everything and then baking and baking... -And baking. -...could do that to you? Merry Christmas, Grace. -Merry Christmas, Felicity. -Doors open in five. Where's Caitlin? -Poor thing. -She's got a lot of expectations to sleep off, I guess. -It's a shame we do that to ourselves. -Doesn't really fit in with the holiday season, does it? You end up missing out on the best time of year. -Oh, can I get you and Maddie in the photo booth before there's a line? -Absolutely. Wait just one minute, though. -Just one? -One minute is literally all this should take. -Grace. Grace. -James, Felicity is obsessed with you. I haven't seen my sister so happy in years. -But Brian... -Forget Brian. She has, I have, we all have. He's back in Chicago. She sent him away. -You did? -Yeah. -Kids, get it together. Talk. Merry Christmas. -Ooh, look at you! -Hey. -Hey! -Did it work? -Yes. -I thought you guys were getting back together. -I thought you didn't want somebody so lost and confused. -I don't. But that's not you, is it? -No. I know what I want. I want to stay in Aspen Grove. I want to bake. And I want to do things my way in my business. -No kidding. -But I also want to do it with a little help from my friends. -That's good news. -Why is that? -'Cause you're gonna need the best butter in the state of Wisconsin, and I just so happen to know a nice guy who can help you out. -Oh, do you? -Yeah. Felicity, whose name means delight and joy. -I am not always delightful. -Yes, you are. -Look. -Well, that weed just won't quit, will it? 'Cause that's where I wanna be - Want - Want
