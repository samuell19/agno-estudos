Can? Can I tell you something Pete? What is it Ed? I knew those police investigators weren't going to find a trace of Mary. Why not? 'Cause she ain’t missing. She's not? No sir, she's not. Well where is she, if she's not missing? After everybody went home that night.... I went and got her in the 'ol truck... ...and brought her back to the farm. She's hanging out there right now! Damn Ed! I swear you got the strangest sense of humor! (chuckling) (some more chuckling) (chuckling some more) (chuckling more and more chuckling) (even more chuckling after all that chuckling!) (just a few more chuckles) So I said to him.... Pete, Mary ain’t missing. He said, what? She's not? Well, where the heck is she? I said, I went, ..and got her that night and brought her back to the farm. And she's been staying there. With me. At my place ever since! (manic laughter) (laughing together now) That, is funny Ed!

It is time for you. To do the Lords work. Are you ready Edward? I'm ready mama. I love you so much mom. I'm so glad you came home. I love you too son.

Well you've got Georgann and.. ..those two boys who need you at home. now don't go getting yourself shot. I won't, I promise ..and if you get yourself shot, then I'm gonna have to find a new manager and you know... ...good help is hard to find. Will you stop? ...worrying? Oh.....you.

I hope you bag a big one. Yeah, me too. Okay! Next time I see him stare at you like that, I'm going to knock his block off! Brian, You have got to watch your temper. Now Ed and his family have been loyal customers for years... ...and we can't afford to lose business just because somebody's a bit of a... ...Oddball He's more than just an oddball! I'm sorry misses Marshall but the guy's a creep. And he can't act that way towards you. Well I can handle myself around the likes of Ed Gein. Don't worry. But, thank you for being so protective. (crowd cheering with Hitler speaking) Edward? Edward? You're not still asleep are you? No mama. Rise and shine boy. You've got a big day today. (crow cawing) Good morning Ed. - Hi Colette Ed honey, you didn't shut the door. Brian out hunting? Yes he is. You want antifreeze right? Yes ma'am, you read my mind. uh, say Ed, why aren't you out there trying to get yourself a deer? Oh, I don't like hunting deer. All that blood and guts. Makes me want to vomit. Yeah, I went hunting once but... I didn't much like it either. Now fishing... That's my sport. But I do like a nice venison steak though. They're real tender. Ain’t that the truth. They're a real delicacy you know, I wish we'd had it more when I was coming up Pa didn't like to hunt much. -Really? Oh. My dad went hunting every spare moment. With Ernie? No ed. Ernie didn't, uh... ..Care for hunting too much. Oh, what did he like to do?. Did he have any hobbies? Ed, that is none of your business. Well I just think a man ought to have hobbies to occupy his time with. Ninety nine cents. Please. Thank you Ed. You have a wonderful morning Colette. Oh. Congratulations on. Being elected Plainfield's... Citizen of the week. I saw your picture in the paper Ed, what are you talking about? It wasn't elected citizen of the week. And my picture has never been in the paper. It wasn't? No, I think if it... ..was, I would have known about it. Oh yeah. It must have been. Somebody else. Somebody that looked like you. Bye Colette Bye Ed. Where do you think you're going? I'm going home. No you're not. You will march right back in there and get what you really came for. And thine ears.... Shall hear a voice behind thee. See This is the way. Walk ye in it. Maybe then, I, I should what 'til later when... ..when there's less people. People around. She's all alone in there. Go on boy. Well, was there something else Ed? Yeah...uh I wondered... I had to... I forgot why I came back in here. I been forgetting a lot lately. Well, it's called old age and it just happens to the best of us. Oh yeah. Now I remember.. I'm thinking of trading in my Marlin rifle for new one. Okay, sure. You see that one. This one? There you go. Now that's one of our biggest sellers. (humming) Oh look. There's Georgann's and new Kaiser. Now I told Brian that I don't really fancy those type of cars but... He went ahead and bought it for her anyway. How you liking that gun Ed? Oh. Oh. Oh..Oh.. Colette? Colette, are you in there? Colette? Georgann? Oh....Oh...(Colette in agony) Are you in there? Georgann? Oh....Oh...(Colette in agony) (phone ringing) Oh....Oh...(Colette in agony still) Hello? (mothers voice). Go get something to wrap her in. You can't carry her outside like that. I'm so nervous mama. I didn't mean to shoot her, it was an accident. Who you kidding'? -This was no accident. it was an execution. It was not an execution! She's still alive. I'm gonna take her back home and nurse her back to health. To help if you're going to do that... You better get moving boy. It's okay, it's okay It's okay, it's okay Oh...oh...(Colette in agony) Mama? What am I gonna do? How am I gonna go get out here mama? My truck is parked out front and uh.. ...folks are gonna see me. Take the delivery truck parked out back in the garage. I don't have the keys! -They're on the key chain.. she used to unlock the gun cabinet. You don't have all day. Hurry boy! (Colette still moaning in pain) I'm gonna take real good care of you Colette Hey Dino? No luck? No, no luck, not today. Did Colette go hunting too? Nah, she's trying to the store. All I seen a delivery guy drive away in your truck early this morning. ..and the store's been closed ever since. no.. Sheriff Stillwell. Jim it's Brian. You uh, gotta get over here to the store real quick now because, uh, uh, There's blood on the floor. Goddamn.....cash register's missing. This is, this is just like we found Mary Hogan's place. Eddy, Eddy Gein must have took her the same way that he, that he, that he, took misses Mary Hogan. Wait a minute Brian, wait. You don't know that. he was staring at Mary and acting really weird. around her, before she disappeared. Well he was doing the exact same thing to misses Marshall and now she's gone too. Alright, alright. I know you're upset but think about what you're saying. Eddy Gein?? He used to babysit my kids. He asked her to go roller skating with him. And to the movies the other day. And he come in yesterday asking about antifreeze. And if I was going hunting. Today. That doesn't mean that kidnapped her. Go on and take a look at this. Jim, if you could have seen the way he was staring at. This doesn't prove anything Sheriff, if Ed is not at home he's probably over at the Andersons house having dinner. Want me to go get him? -No We're going to do this by the book. I'll be right back. Brian? -I'll be right back. Brian? Brian, come back here! Brian! Eddy, open up! Gein, open this door! Misses Marshall, can you hear me! Son of a bitch! Oh God! No! Oh Jesus! This venison you butchered today cooked up real nice and juicy Ed. Thank you for the present. Phil is going to be in heaven when he sees what's for dinner. Well, it was my pleasure. I know how much and your hubby like to eat. Eddy's truck isn't here. What the hell you gonna do with that gun? What's wrong with you? So Ed, you gonna tell me why you put the old tires back on your truck or not? Pete I, I told you, I didn't change my tires. Hello? Oh, hi Bill. Oh my God, wonder what for? Well I hope it's nothing serious. Maybe something's happened to Colette or Brian. I... ...I guess we'll soon find out. Alright, we'll talk to you then. Bye. Bill said something's happened down at the Marshall's store. State crime lab is supposed to be coming in to check it out. Is that right? I was just in there this morning buying antifreeze. Boy, somebody must have really been bloodthirsty. Ed, why is that you're always around when someone goes missing? I don't know Judy just luck I guess. I'd say we go downtown check out all the excitement. Hey Judy. Howdy Brian. Brian, what are you doing? This animal killed misses Marshall! ...and I'm gonna kill him! You think, Ed, killed Colette? She's hanging in his cellar! Butchered like a deer! He told us he was at the store this morning. Buying antifreeze. And then he put the old tires back on his truck and tried to lie about! I did no such thing Pete! This is all crazy..I Somebody must be trying to frame me, Brian! Brian? Better quit while you're ahead. I'm gonna blow your brains all over these walls! Don't be stupid! Jim, I don't even know what he's talking about. -Shut up! Brian. Gimme the damn gun! No! Holy sh.... What the fuck.. -I'm about the kill Ed, Phil! Okay, turn your heads everybody. Or watch if you want. Brian, don't make me do it. Brian, please let Jim handle it. For Colette, please! I don't need any more trouble now. Stand up. Turn around. Put your hands behind your back. Move. Pick your feet up. Jim, you gotta believe me. Shut up, you sick son of a bitch! I ought to fill you full of lead! This is ridiculous. I don't know nothing about nobody hanging in my cellar! You don't huh? Then how did she get there? Don't say a word, boy. You've done nothing wrong! How could you do it, Eddy? huh? Colette was such a nice lady! That evil witch got exactly what she deserved! You have done God's. Work. I tell you what. I hope you fry for it! Move. And upon her forehead... Was written a name. Mystery. Babylon The great... The mother of harlots. And abominations of the earth. To this day, I don't have any memory of... Either Mary or Colette being killed. I guess... Some people are just calm on the surface and... Hotheads underneath. Please God. Stop this evil spirit. From invading my body and my mind. Please God. Stop this evil spirit. I'm sorry I, I disturbed you, it was wrong. My mom was very strong minded, she believed the... Sinful modern women with.. Short skirts, lipstick, and powder. Should be shunned.. as much as possible. It's a good place. Good hospital. People treat me nice. Some folks are... Pretty disturbed though, you know. My mother was a saint. [Captions by Ed]
