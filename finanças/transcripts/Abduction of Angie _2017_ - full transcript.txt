'Is there a birthday girl in there?' Good morning, birthday girl! Happy birthday. You made pancakes, my favorite. - Of course. - With little eyeballs. I know. And a smiley face? So after breakfast we're gonna go to the park. You get to play with your friends. Does that sound good?- '-' Yeah? Okay. Cool. - I love you. - Love you too. Am I getting a princess castle? Not telling. What about a bike? Not telling! What about a...puppy? Definitely not. I promise, you're gonna have the best birthday even so. - Let's go see your friends. - Okay. 'What if we go get your nails painted later?' - 'Yeah.' - 'Would that be fun?' 'Yeah.' There's Linda! - Hey, birthday girl. - Hey. Thank you so much for watching my little munchkin. Of course. She's a treat. Don't even worry about it. Yes, she is. Alright, I have to go. Have a good day, okay? I love you. Okay. Love you more. Who is this that you brought with you? This is Princess. Hello, Princess. Nice to meet you. You wanna go find the other kids? - Yeah. - Okay. Step aside please. Thank God you're here. He just fell! We were walking.. We're out one for our morning walk and he just fell! Your husband's in good hands with this paramedic team, ma'am. Okay. Clear. Come on. And it's magic time. Magic time. Hi, everybody. Magic time. Magic time. Come on, guys. Here we are. Let the show begin. - Now, who likes magic? - Me! I know. You know, I can tell. I have a magic meter. And I can see it coming out of your ear. Thatis what I call magic. You better hold on to that. Now, magic is everywhere 'and all we need to do is' think very hard, and we can make anything.. You know.. It's.. My allergies are kinda pickin' up today. Does anyone have a handkerchief? No? You don't have a handkerchief? Maybe I can find a handkerchief. I, I, I have a handkerchief. I have one. Heh heh. - Okay. Anybody want it? - No. No, because it's really disgusting. So let's put that away and let's really make it go away. So what's the magic word? Abracadabra! And it's gone. Absolutely gone. - Can I help you, sir? - Hi. You must be Linda? I am Mason Smith. Professional entertainer. Miranda Masters hired me for her daughter Angie's birthday. She didn't tell me. Welcome. May I surprise the birthday girl herself? Of course. Go ahead. But, first.. ...how about this? Bubbles! - Bubble guns. - My goodness. Come on. There it is. Clear. Clear. Come on. Clear. - Check his pulse. - Baby! Are you feeling okay? It's gonna be alright, sir. Good job. I'll see you later at Angie's party, alright? She's so excited. Let's go. Well, well. What's your name? I'm not supposed to tell. Excuse me, miss, I was speaking to the puppy there. That's Princess. Hello, Princess. And how are you today? I'm fine, thank you. She can't talk. Of course, she can. You just have to listen. What's that, Princess? Today is Angie's birthday? And this is Angie? Well, well, well. How about that? Princess, how about you and me do something very special for Angie's birthday? - You like magic? - Yeah. Say the magic word. Abracadabra! Wow! Angie? Angie? Angie! Angie! Good going back there. You earned that coffee. Thank you. Ooh! Hot, hot, hot. Hey, Linda. How's Angie? What? I didn't even see a vehicle. - He just sort of vanished. - 'June!' June! June! - It's okay. - I am so sorry. - Linda! - Okay.. Why weren't you watching her? - How did you let this happen? - Hey, hey. Whoa-whoa-whoa. Slow down, slow down, slow down. Alright? Slow down. It's okay. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - It's okay. My God. - Angie! - Listen, listen, listen. Focus right here, okay? We're all here. We're gonna try and find Angie. It's gonna be okay. Now, we got a photo, and I need you to tell me if you recognize the suspect. - You got a photo? - I took it. It's okay. Do you recognize him? - My God. - Miranda? His name is Luke Masters. He's my father. - Your what? - He's my father. - My God. - Okay. Yeah. Hey, there. We got a name. It's okay. Hey. I'm so sorry this is happening. Why didn't you tell me about your father? I just didn't want him to matter anymore. After my mom died.. ...he just wouldn't butt out of my life. He hated my boyfriend. James was a good guy. But my dad took the first chance he got at arresting him.. ...for having a fake ID. Can you imagine? Something so stupid. That night James spent in county.. ...he got murdered by some.. ...biker guy. I never forgave my father for putting him there. After that I just, I left home as soon as I could. Do you know what your father would want with Angie? He wasn't even supposed to know that Angie exists. He's been in prison. Corruption charges, bribery. That kinda thing. I don't even know how he found us. What if I never see Angie again? That's not going to happen. I'm standing here outside the Masters residence. An AMBER Alert has been issued for seven-year-old Angela Masters who was abducted from a playground earlier today. The suspected kidnapper.. her own grandfather, Luke Masters. Shut up! 'Hey, Missy. Well, we missed you at the park this morning.' 'Don't worry. Now everything's gonna be fine.' 'See you soon. Love you.' Today is Princess' birthday. Princess! Make a wish. What do you think she wished for? Probably for another pink ribbon. - 'Another pink ribbon?' - 'Another pink ribbon!' 'My gosh. She loves pink.' 'We've got to give her a pink..' I think it's time for Princess to eat her veggies. Ho. The only dog that likes veggies, I tell ya. - Princess is special. - Yes, she is. Angie. '...it's her birthday.' 'What do you think Princess wants next, a carrot?' 'Yeah. Here.' Hey. I brought food. 'You love Princess?' - 'Yes.' - 'You love Princess. Aw.' Miranda, are you okay? Hey. Hey, June. He left a message. What? Let me hear. 'Hey, Missy. Well, we missed you at the park this morning.' 'Don't worry. Now everything's gonna be fine.' 'See you soon. Love you.' How the hell did he find out where we were? He was a cop. Yeah, a crooked cop. I just wish I could remember something. Anything...to help. Just with the way he was.. ...it's like I suppressed it all. Of course, you did. Hello, Princess. How are you doing today? You would like some tea? Okay. There you go. 'Miranda! Dinner!' Coming, mom. Come on, Princess, dinnertime. 'Elaine, please, don't leave.' 'I don't wanna lose my family.' 'Luke..' 'Be right there, honey.' Would you like any tea? You liked it. I knew you would! Mom, why aren't you drinking your tea? I can't take it anymore. Mom? Mommy, are you okay? Lies. Everything he ever said.. ...was always a lie. Hey, Missy.. How about we go on a little vacation somewhere? 'Really?' We're gonna go some place nice and sunny. No one can ever take you away. No. Please. No one can ever take you away. No, please. Miranda. Hey, hey, Miranda. Wake up. Hey. Miranda, you're okay. You're okay. You're okay. I can't do this. I can't. Yes, you can. Honey, I'm a cop. And let me tell you, I've seen a lot. And for all the years we've known each other.. ...I've never met anyone tougher. You got away from your father. You lost your husband and you were raising Angie on your own. Honey, your day job is saving people's lives. If I'd had things as hard as you I don't know what I would have done. But you can do this. You're strong. And I'm here for you. I am always here for you. What if he's doing this to get back at me.. ...for leaving him? We're gonna get Angie back. There was a duck pond. I remember going there as a kid. Well, that's something. - Where is it? If I find it.. - Don't you touch me! Miranda! Get out of here! You let me go right now. Yeah, but the call can't be that hard to trace. Yeah, I know it's not magic, but-- Yeah, alright. Alright. Hey, Miranda. Miranda, are you up there? Hey, I just got off the phone with my guy. 'Miranda.' Hey, Miranda. Miranda. 'Miranda, where are you?' I'm just on a drive. I'll be back. On a drive going where? There's just something I have to do. If you're thinking of going after Luke you better turn your ass around, because he is dangerous. I can handle this, June. Miranda.. Miranda? Damn it. 'Police are still looking for Luke Masters' 'on suspicion of kidnapping' 'his seven-year-old granddaughter, Angela.' 'A former member of the Acorn Valley Police Department' 'Masters, was recently released from prison.' 'Masters' former partner, Officer Leonard Henderson' 'refused to comment on the current case.' 'Friends of the family believe Masters' downward spiral' 'predated his wife's apparent suicide years ago.' - Hi. Can I help you? - Hi. We're not officially open for business yet. I'm sorry to bother you. Um, I used to live here. In Acorn Valley? Yeah, but I mean, in this house. Miranda? - Miranda Masters? - Yeah. - Kieran? My God. - Come in, please. My God. It's been ages. I never thought we'd see you back in Acorn Valley again. You got out of here pretty much as fast as you could. What brings you back? Family business. That's the way it goes. Well, come on. Let me show you what we've done with the place. Wow. So many memories here. I bet. I hope our renovations aren't too upsetting. No, no. You guys have done a great job with the house. Thank you. That means a lot. 'Are you staying in town for the night, or..' Um, yeah. Maybe several days. Stay here. You could be our first guest. You know, this could actually be your room. Wow. This literally is my old room. The stars align. It's so crazy, I never thought I would run into anyone from the old group. I know. - It's good to see you again. - You too. Do you have any bags? Do you want me to go grab 'em? - Yeah. Thank you. - Of course. Make yourself at home. 'It has now been confirmed' 'by the Acorn Valley police department that' 'the search for seven-year-old Angela Masters continues.' 'It's widely believed that the girl was kidnapped' 'by her strange grandfather, Luke Masters.' 'Angela's family has declined comment at this time.' 'But we will continue to report on Angela's disappearance' 'as more developments are brought to light.' - Hey. - Hey. Thought you might be hungry. - Thank you. - Of course. So, I've been super busy with the business recently. I haven't really paid attention to what's actually going on. So, sorry for being late on the uptake. I just saw the news. 'You know, like I said earlier' if there's anything else that I can do.. Miranda, please, let me know. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. Of course. Alright, get some rest. I'll see you in the morning. Hello. - Mrs. Henderson? - Yes. It's Miranda Masters. Leonard! Gracious! Come in, dear. Come in. Leonard! Look who's here. It's Miranda. 'Can I get you some tea or coffee?' 'No, thank you.' 'Well, we've been watching the news all day.' Heaven knows what you've been going through. - Thanks. - Have they heard anything? No, not yet. Actually, I was wondering if you could help me. 'I know things got rough, but you didn't keep in contact' 'with my father much, did you?' Um, Luke and I were close until his fraud charges. I couldn't defend him that time. "That time?" I-I mean, the evidence. I mean, all the evidence was there. There was no contradicting testimony. Well, your father would call us occasionally. Not for very long, though. It was very awkward. Um, he had no one else. Do you know where he's living? Or if he has any other local property? 'He got into hunting a little while ago.' He kept asking me if I wanted to go with. I always declined. He didn't get that associating with a convict on a personal level, might not be too good for a cop. Is that how he found out where I was, from a cop? Now, just what are you suggesting? I'm just trying to make sense of the worst 48 hours of my life. Honey, I-I-I know. I know, I'm sorry. Opal, my mother adored you. Your mother was such a sweetheart. Did she mention where she wanted to go? On vacation? Or where she would set up her dream home? Your mother always told me that she loved taking you to "A place where the forests sing." But she also said she felt at home when she was with you. I remember. I wish there was more we could tell you. I-I do hope things turns out alright. Yeah. Thank you for your time. Well, I'll-I'll show you out. Don't look at me like that, Opal. I was waiting to see what you were gonna do. This was all supposed to be left behind us. Things like this don't stay where you want 'em to. I'm going to the store. Let me know if you need anything. - Hey. - Hey. What's goin' on? Question. I'm trying to remember if there's a duck pond around here somewhere really popular with families in the summer. - Do you know how to get there? - Yeah. Of course. What are you up to? Um, just visiting some places from my childhood. Sure. Well, do you mind if I tag along? I'm just better with showing directions than telling them. Um, yeah. Yeah. Sure. - You sure? Okay. - Yeah. - I'm gonna go lock up. - Okay. Hey there, partner. What are you doin' here? Mind if I borrow some gas? I've gone a long way today. This is it. It's nice, isn't it? Yeah. Um, do you mind staying here for a minute? I just need a minute to myself here. Yeah, do your thing. I'll hold down the fort. Thanks. You know, sometimes, when they're too tired to swim the mother duck will carry the ducklings on her back? Won't she sink? Of course not. Nature designed them that way. You know, I'm like a mother duck too. I'll always carry you, okay? Even when you're too big to carry, like now. Look, there's more ducks over there. Come on. Whoa. Throw it gently. That way we won't scare 'em away. Like this? This is like junk food for ducks. They love it, but it's best in small doses. Why are some ducks' heads green and some are brown? Well, the green ones are the daddy ducks. They're pretty. How come you never came here for my birthday before? Sweetheart, grandpa was living very far away. And I missed mommy, and I wanted to meet you so I came back. Now we can all be together. Did your mommy never bring you here before? No. We used to come here all the time. 'Really?' - Hello? - 'Angie!' Mommy. Mommy! Mom, we had so much fun. It's been the best birthday ever. Grandpa and Angie have been having a great time. - Show mommy our magic trick? - Yeah. Yeah, hey, I need you to run a trace on a phone call I'm getting on my personal phone. I need you to do it now. Abracadabra! Yeah! - That's cool. - Hey, sweetheart.. why don't you go play for a little bit? And mommy and grandpa have a grownup talk. Okay. Glad you showed up. Thought you'd remember this place. We always had so much fun here. Mom and I had fun here. Why didn't you ever call me? Why didn't you ever come see me? I missed you, Miranda. You've had your fun. Please just give her back to me. Hey, you heard Angie. A little surprise visit from grandpa was the best birthday ever. She doesn't know any better. She's not yours. Maybe now you know how it feels wondering where your daughter's gone and disappeared to. Wondering if she's missing you, wondering if she's okay. Please, Miranda. I just want a chance to be...a grandfather. We'll be a family again. You, her-- Go to hell, and try again in the next life. After all this time, you still don't know what I went through for you and your mother. Tell me what happened the night mom died. Now, why would you be thinking about that? I remember it. I couldn't sleep that night. - I could hear you two arguing-- - We argued. Parents argue. Mostly about you. So what? She was gonna take me and leave you, wasn't she? I tried to stop her. You don't know how she hurt me, Missy. - I saw the blood. - Miranda.. Did she find out you were a dirty cop? That's enough. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. 'Miranda.' Miranda! Run, Angie! Faster, Angie! I'm almost beating you. I'll beat you to the car. Run! Go, Angie! What do you think you're doing? Hey! If you wanna be a family again, you come find me. You knew to find me here, you'll figure out where we're headed. I know you're mad now, but just remember, Missy I am your father, and I love you. Miranda? Damn it. Hold on. Angie! Angie! Sweetheart! We're leaving! But I don't see mommy's car. We'll take grandpa's van instead. - You can be my co-pilot. - Okay. Hop in there, sweet pea. Buckle up now. Stop! June! He has Angie. They're in the van. What the hell? Pilot to co-pilot. You ready to blast off, pumpkin? - Yes, sir. - Here we go. - June! Are you okay? - I'm fine. I'm fine. Okay, it's just a graze. Miranda! Miranda! What the hell's going on? He has Angie. Get in the car. Miranda, we should let the cops do this kind of thing. Yeah, that was a cop he just shot back there. Damn it! This is all my fault. Why didn't I just grab her when I had the chance? 'I shouldn't have let him get her to begin with.' Miranda, it isn't your fault. 'Your dad is literally a psy..' Whoa! Holy crap. What the hell just happened? Just relax. Relax. I'll take care of it. Are you kidding me? I just had these stupid things put on! Hey, just relax, relax, relax, relax, it's okay. Do you have a spare? Yeah? This isn't happening. This is not happening. 'Tell me about Angie.' What? Do we have to have this conversation right now? Please. I just think, we shouldn't treat her like she's already gone. She loves animals. Every year she always asks me for a puppy and I always thought I didn't have time for a dog. Never had time. I have a cousin who breeds like Jack Russell-Chi something. Like Jack Russell terriers mixed with Chihuahuas, I think. Anyway, I can hook you up.. ...once we get Angie back. - Thank you. - Of course. It's the least I can do. Hey, Kieran, when.. 'Back when everything happened with my mom' do you, do you remember anything about it? Nobody really liked talking about it. I-I think my mom and I were, were going to leave him. And he got mad. Wait, so.. Do you think he, like.. You know.. - Yeah. - My God. And there's no way to prove it, is there? Is-is there anybody else that knows about it? Miranda, come on, think. Your dad was a dirty cop. Cops have partners, right? Yeah, I already talked to his partner. - And? - I don't know. I mean, he seemed like he wanted nothing to do with any of this. Of course he didn't. I wouldn't either, if my past was coming back to haunt me. What am I supposed to do, hold him at gunpoint? Maybe someone else can. Miranda, what's happening? Hey, Leonard Henderson. My dad's old partner. I need you to go talk to him. What? Why? I think he has something to do with this. What happened in the past. How my dad even found me now. He might know where he's taking Angie. Listen, I-I-I tried to talk to him 'and his wife earlier, but he wouldn't talk to me.' So, maybe you can apply the right kind of pressure. - Miranda, where are you? - 'Please, June.' - 'This could be the key.' - Miranda, I.. Miranda? Miran.. You know you don't have to do this. What, change the tire? You know what I mean. Yeah. But, I want to. - I wish I could remember. - Remember what? We were supposed to go somewhere before my mom died. Have some big family vacation. I just wish I could remember where. I think that's where he's taking Angie. - 'Where's mom?' - She's on her way, pumpkin. Where are we going? To a very special place I used to take your mom. We're all gonna be there together. A little vacation. Hey, what kinda songs do you like to sing? - I don't know. - You don't know? Come on, must have some kind of song that you like. Hey, did you know grandpa can play guitar? - Really? - Yes. And when we get where we're goin' I'm gonna play you some songs. Now what song can we sing? ♪ We'll all have Angie's birthday when she comes ♪ ♪ When she comes ♪ And we'll all have Angie's birthday when she comes ♪ ♪ When she comes Mrs. Henderson? I'm Detective Harmon. My apologies. Leonard isn't here right now. That's okay. I was wondering if I may speak with you? Of course. What-what can I help you with, detective? Well, I understand that your family's familiar with the Masters family. Yes. - Would you like to come in? - Yeah, thanks. I-I was just having some tea, would you like some? No. Thank you. So, I take it you've been following the story. Yes. I know all about what's been going on with the Masters girls. I understand that your husband used to work with Luke Masters. Used to, yes. So, what's their relationship like now? Please, if there's anything. This is not about accusing your husband. This is about saving a little girl. Things were different back then. "Back then?" Leonard has always been more of a follower than a leader. Luke, his partner at the time, was a very charismatic man. My husband is a good man, but he needs direction. So, what direction did Luke give your husband? He's not helping Luke now, if that's what you're asking. Everything stopped after that young boy. "Young boy?" The young boy Miranda was dating? James, I think his name was. He was arrested for using a fake ID. He was murdered in his cell that night. A few nights later I found copies of that fake ID in Leonard's car. I know he didn't mean for that boy to be killed. He made those fake IDs because Luke told him to. Does your husband always do what Luke asks him to? After that boy was murdered, he was scared away from Luke for good. He's been nothing but a community hero since then. I see. So, um, where is your husband now? Working. Yeah. - Detective.. - Yeah. Leonard is no threat. He has suffered enough all these years and he's all I have. I just don't wanna die alone. Is that too much to ask? No, of course not. But I hope you understand I'm gonna do everything I can to save that little girl. I understand. Now, I've told you a lot of things today. Things I've never told anyone. Maybe it's because you're a cop, just like Leonard. And maybe it's because I know what can happen when the wrong people apply the right kind of pressure. Well, thank you very much for your time, Mrs. Henderson. I'll see myself out. - Hey. - Hey. I don't even know what to do with myself. I have to get her back. Some things are just out of our control. 'Maybe you just need a distraction.' 'Clear your mind.' Bad stuff happens to good people. Hey, listen, I'm gonna go finish up some gardening outside. Will you be okay here? - Can I help? - Sure. You're right, I just need a distraction, I guess. Of course. I'll meet you out back. Alright, alright. Here you go. What? Too colorful? You don't actually wear that, do you? What? Me? No, I bought it in case a guest wants to do a little gardening. - Really? - I think that's you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Yeah. - So? - Hey, I like it. Alright, what's the plan? How do you want these? There's no plan. Just do your thing. Gardening is therapeutic. Yeah, I think so. Angie would really like these flowers. I'm sure she would. Hello? I just received a visit from a detective, Leonard. What? Why? Be careful on your way home tonight, dear. Pumpkin.. Do you mind if I join you? Please. - You look nice. - Thank you. - Get you a glass of wine or? - Yes, please. - I hope white's okay? - Yeah. It's great. It's all we have left. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hey, can I ask you something personal? Sure. I guess. Ha-ha. Depending. Is there a Mr. Miranda Masters? He passed away right before Angie was born. My God. I'm sorry. Thank you. What happened? He had a heart condition. Had a valve replaced but he got an infection, and just.. ...just like that. It was pretty devastating. It's just been me and her ever since. I hope Angie knows she has a supermom. By the way, you got mail. - What? - No address. I'll be right back. "Dear Mommy.. I had so much fun with grandpa today." He said he's going to get me a puppy. And we're gonna go on vacation. I'm so glad I have a grandpa. You should come too. Love, Angie. - Can I help you? - Excuse me. 'June, how's your arm?' Okay. Thought I might find you here. Um, I need to speak to Miranda alone. Sure. So, um.. Leonard was out, and I spoke to Opal Henderson. And? And Leonard was a dirty cop. That's for sure. He was helping your dad back in the day and he still might be now. But there's something else, and, um.. I'm not sure if you wanna know. What? So, when James was arrested for the fake ID Leonard's the one who made the ID. And your dad planted it. He was framed? Wow. Just to get him out of my life. I'm sorry. Where was Leonard? Opal said he was out working. - We need to find him. - "We?" Okay, Miranda, you need to stop putting yourself in danger. Maybe if we confront Leonard you offer him a lighter sentence if he tells us where Luke went. Okay, it doesn't exactly work like that. Okay? I am not saying that Opal lied to me but her word is not proof. Besides, we can't go barging in there without a warrant. Then what? What do we do? Youdon't do anything. Is it theoretically possible for you to know where Leonard's dispatched, when he's dispatched? Theoretically...yes. I do have a connection at the local department. - Okay, I have a plan. - No. No, all you have to do is tell me when and where Leonard ends up tomorrow. Preferably somewhere in public. Okay, you realize this is all kinds of illegal. Just trust me, okay? My God. Yeah? - Hey. - Hey. Just wanted to check in on you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - You're doing okay? - I'm okay. Okay. Well, get some rest. Long day. I completely forgot. I, um, saved some stuff from the attic. Think you might be interested in it. - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. I can't believe you kept all this stuff. Wow. Angie would love these! Princess! My God. I would bury myself in my stuffed animals whenever my parents would fight. It was my safe place. What made you decide to turn this place into a B&B anyway? It's a long story. Longer than the stories I've been springing on you? Fair enough. Alright, um.. I guess I just always wanted to open a hotel chain. It's crazy, right? I just remember being a kid going on vacation. Going to this huge resort. I barely remember anything else from the vacation other than how cool the hotel was. You know, ice cream machine in the hallways, five pools.. But.. Yeah, we didn't go on many vacations after that. Dad started gambling. Mom started drinking. I'm sorry. No, it's.. It's okay. It was tough. Money went kind of quickly. I didn't get the full university experience, but, um.. Today, maybe I can capture a sliver of the feeling I had as a kid, here in Acorn Valley. Clearly not on the same scale, but.. You know, a place that people will remember. Well, I think you've done a great job. Thanks. 'I'm glad you're the one who got this place.' 'I'm sorry about what happened.' 'With your mom and everything.' Is it hard to come back here after all this time? It was a little creepy going up those stairs again. But it's nice. Despite everything, I loved this house. I'm glad it's in good hands. - Thanks for that. - You too. Is this you? My.. Yup. I'm telling you, when I found all this stuff I knew there was a reason not to throw it out. You knocked on that door, proved me right. - June? - 'Hey.' 'Henderson just got called to a possible DUI. I got this.' June's got a lead. I need your help. You got that look. - We gotta go. - Fine. I'm driving. Alright, guys, he's all yours. What're you doing here? I need to ask you something. Go ahead. Does Opal know you're a dirty cop? Or did you just keep that to yourself? - Excuse me? - You were my dad's partner. He must've found out about me and Angie some way. And this photo was left for me last night. How did he get to me? How did they get away so easily? I've heard enough of this. If you don't help me, I might never see my daughter again. Listen.. I didn't know what he was up to. 'I thought he just really wanted to see you again.' I thought maybe prison had changed him for the better. You're his daughter. Look, I did some things that I regret. That's where it ends. Luke is on his own now. Just go home. Let the police do their work. You are the police. What're you doing to stop this? It's out of my jurisdiction. If you wanna make up for what you did tell me where this photo was taken. Looks like that old cabin up north. You went there a couple of times when you were a kid. Where is it? I think it's part of that Whispering Willows resort. Just try talking to him. He's still your family. Your blood. You know.. ...it doesn't matter if you weren't the one who did it. James, my mother.. You helped them die when you could've saved them. But you were only interested in saving face. Maybe that's the only thing you could save. Miranda. 'How'd it go?' Well...he recognized it as the Whispering Willows. Well, did he say which cabin? It's a big place. Just take me back to the house. Leonard! I didn't expect you home so early. 'Dear, what's the matter?' I can't keep this up, Opal. What do you mean? I can't. I.. They need to know how this really happened. 'None of this is your fault.' It's the Masters family that has done all of this. Everything that has gone wrong has been down on them. You are a fine man. A fine cop. They're not gonna drag you down into this. It's too late. I need to make this right. What do you mean? Where are you going, Leonard? - What? - Something's come up. We need to talk. But it's gotta be in person. - You know where. - Yeah. You better have something good. That's enough, Luke. You've gone too far. - What? - Jesus. You kidnapped a little girl. - Where is she? - Wait, wait, wait, wait. I am spending time with my granddaughter. - You need to turn yourself in. - Excuse me? If you love your family you have to do the right thing. Like you would know the right thing? I hope so. The boys are probably out lookin' for me even as we speak. What did you do? The right thing. There's still time for you to do the same for yourself. You never had any guts, did you? That wasn't a suggestion. It's been a long rough ride, Luke. But this has to end. Shh. You know...even way back then you only ever held me down. Luke.. ...please. Adios,partner. No. Hello. 'So, a little birdie told me that' 'Leonard Henderson confessed to some pretty big things.' You wouldn't have anything to do with that, would you? Where are you? Where's Angie? She's with me, of course. And you know where I am. 'Why is this a game to you?' Game of life, sweet pea. The life I want. You, me, and Angie makes three. I'm tired of begging. It's time to end this. Be a good girl and come home. 'Hello? Hello?' - Hey, you okay? - I'm alright. Hold it, slow down. What happened? - I need to go. - Where? - It's not important. - No, it is important, Miranda. Please, don't put yourself in danger. People care about you. I care about you. I care about you too, but I have to do this on my own. Just hold on, let me go with you. No! Not this time. Miranda. Miranda! - Hey, Miranda. - 'She took off.' What, what do you mean she took off? Where'd she go? I don't know. She wouldn't tell me. Of course she told you. Where is she? Bottom line is, we got Henderson to confess. He recognized the place from some photos Luke sent Miranda. It's a cabin up in Whispering Willows. I guess he used to take her there when she was young. What, the Whispering Willows resort? Yeah, campground, canoeing all that stuff. I guess there's cabin's up there too. 'Miranda, what are you doing?' I'm doing what I have to do, June. Okay, well, stop it, 'cause your father's nuts. 'We can get the cops there ASAP. You don't need to do this.' This is my family. I have to take care of this. You would do the same thing. - Great. - What do we do? You don't do anything, alright? There's been enough vigilantism. No, no, no, I can't just do nothing. - We gotta go help her. - You wanna help her? Be here for her when she gets back, alright? - No, June. I'm gonna go. - I got this. ♪ And we'll open lot of presents when she comes ♪ Whoo-hoo! ♪ We'll open lot of presents when she comes ♪ Whoo-hoo! ♪ We'll have a big ol' party ♪ And we're havin' a big ol' party invite everybody ♪ ♪ We're havin' a big ol' party Hello. What? Okay. Okay. Damn. The service road's faster. Hey, beansprout. What you want for dinner? Hot dogs. I can do that. What you drawing? Us. That's a good drawing. I'll go make dinner. Mrs. Henderson. I'm so sorry to have to inform you that your husband was shot 'and killed today.' But I promise you, we're doing everything we can to find the person responsible. Twelve. Twelve, twelve, twelve. - Talk. - 'Hey, I found it.' - The Whispering Willows? - The resort cabins, number 12. - Wait until I get there. - June, she's in there. Leonard Henderson's dead. Okay, your father has lost it. Do not put yourself in that situation. Please, wait until I get there. Hurry. 'Grandpa!' Just a minute, sweetheart. Grandpa's very busy. With what? Where's mommy? You're gonna have to be a big girl now, Angie. - Mommy isn't coming. - 'Why not?' Well, she doesn't want us anymore. She's probably just saving people. You need to be more patient, grandpa. Maybe you're right. It's just you and me, sweetheart. Dinner will be ready soon. Okay. Hey. You made it. - Why are you doing this? - I told you, Missy. I want a family again. I don't think you ever had one. Really? All that time in prison.. ...thinking of having you in my life again is what got me through every damn day in that hole. Everything I've ever done has been for you. Then let Angie go. Please, Missy. You're still taking after your mother. Blaming everybody except yourself. Excuse me? You should've been there for Angie. Not dumping her on some playground on her birthday, so you can go off to save everyone else in the world. How do you think that makes her feel? Just stop. Admit it, Miranda. You've needed me, you've always needed me. Where's Angie? Shh. Shh. It doesn't have to be like this, you know. We can still be a family. A family, a real one. Miranda, it's what you've always wanted all these years. I know it. We could've had one. You framed my boyfriend, and got him killed. He wanted to take you away from me. Just like your mother did. Let go! You let me go! Miranda! Aah! It wasn't an accident, was it? She made me do it, Missy. She thought she could... spit in my face and leave me after everything I had done for her. She was selfish and ungrateful. Please, don't be like her. Angie.. She's perfect. She does as she's told. She doesn't ask questions. She knows her place. It's not too late for us. 'You bring a friend?' You should know better. Four's a crowd. If you change your mind, Missy, you're always welcome home. No, please, no. Shh. I'll be waiting for your decision, Missy. Angie will be waiting for you. Don't let your daughter down again. Please, please! Miranda! Angie? 'Kieran.' My god. Miranda, are you okay? - My God. - He's here. Where is he? Angie. He has Angie! Look, hey, hey. Look at me. It's gonna be okay. Just hold on, you stay right here. I'm goin' to find her. I'm gonna find her. 'Kieran, wait!' Kieran! Angie? 'Angie?' Sure you think you're a real big man. Scaring a little girl and her mother. 'Hurting your own daughter.' - Wait! - Angie. No. Kieran. Go, get Angie. He's hurt. 'Angie.' I'll do whatever you want. As long as I get to stay with Angie. It was only ever gonna be a vacation, Miranda. A vacation. All this, the cops, the panic.. ...it could've been avoided. You know what else is your fault? Your mother wouldn't have died if it weren't for you. 'Yeah, she was always trying to protect you and defend you.' You and all the little games you would play. This wouldn't have happened if you had just done what you were told like a good girl. So, what now? Well, haven't decided between Canada or Mexico yet. Sunshine's nice, but I love that real maple syrup. Either way, we'll get ourselves a nice place on the beach. Get Angie that puppy she always wanted. Maybe I get back in the dating game. Find a woman. Someone who'd be a really good example for Angie. You can join us. Maybe we can be that perfect family. Just like in all those old sitcoms. What about Kieran? Are you just gonna leave him out there? The cops'll be by soon enough, right? We'll be long gone by then. So, that's all I gotta do? Yeah. I think you get the picture. Okay. Okay, dad. You do this to me, in my own house! What does it take to teach you some respect? Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Opal. You don't think you're to blame for this too? Opal, what are you doing? You brought us back into all of this. You made him turn himself in. I'm never gonna see my husband again and it's all your fault! Angie. Angie! - Mommy! - Angie. Sweetheart. Are you okay? Are you okay? I'm fine. I was right! You were gonna come. Of course I was. Grandpa lied about that, didn't he? Sweetheart.. ...grandpa lied about a lotta things. Guess I'm not getting a puppy either, am I? Not from him. Let's go. - Surprise! - Surprise! My God! You didn't have to! Happy birthday! - Thank you. - You're welcome. Birthday girl. Are those all my presents? All of them, and I got something in particular for you that I think, you're gonna like. - Yes. - Are you ready? Maybe, may.. Aw, thank you so much. - You're welcome. - I love her! Here. Come here, buddy. Come here, bud. You finally got a puppy! - I've always wanted a puppy. - I know. 'It's about time. It's about time.' You like her? - I love her. - My God. I can't believe you did that. - I told you. - I think she likes you. She's a sweet kid. Though I can see where she gets it from. Please. You know what, maybe I'll stick around a few extra days. It's nice getting out of Acorn Valley. I mean, you're gonna need some help training this puppy, right? - Right? - Yes. - Right, you're a dog mom now. - That would be nice. - That would be nice. - You're a dog mom. Ice cream! Who wants ice cream? My. Yes. Please, yes. 'Ice cream, puppy. What do you want, Angie?' 'What more can you ask for?'
