- In times past, alien visitations were apparently very common. Tribes in North and South America documented such visits with cave and rock drawings, legends passed down through the generations, and sculptures. These legends speak of people coming from the stars to help mankind. Almost all Native American tribes have such legends and all appear to be true. Throughout antiquity, legends speak of travelers from the stars who helped mankind on Earth. American tribes say these travelers were benevolent beings and tales of their existence are still told today. The Hopi believe their ancestors came from the Pleiades, the place or people they call Chuhukon or those who cling together, a reference it seems to that tightly grouped starry cluster, as it appears to the naked eye. Likewise, early Dakota legends speak of the Pleiades as the abode of the ancestors. Other native oral histories or legends speak of an origin, if not in the Pleiades, then in the stars generally or other constellations. The Cree for example arrived on earth from the stars as spirits and then became human beings. Other native legends including those of the Lakota speak not necessarily of Star People, but of mysterious beings coming from above as spheres of light that in turn abduct children, a reference to popular folklore about alien abduction and breeding programs that are not for the faint hearted. The Zuni Indians offer one of many belief systems if not actual experiences related to ancestors who came from the sky, a phrasing that has since morphed into the more new age Star People reference as opposed to Sky People. A Lakota legend speaks of seven maidens being chased by a bear. On their knees, they prayed for divine intervention. The result being that the ground beneath them erupted high into the air, lifting them out of harm's way as the bear clawed at the risen ground. The result was Devil's Tower, Wyoming. The bear's claws having carved vertical geological features into the rock and the seven maidens have been installed above as the Pleiades. Clifford Mahooty, a Zuni elder and member of the Kachina Society, tells us that his grandfathers taught him about a very direct connection his people have had with beings from space. Mahooty at the same time explains that the language of his grandfathers, his elders, was not, of course, English, and that he has interpreted their words and concepts into modern phrasings that nonetheless accurately represent the old beliefs. A concept that has gained a foothold in some quarters of modern Native American thought, that the ancestors were extraterrestrial aliens and that they continue to visit and interact with people to this day. The modern unidentified flying object or UFO craze began in the late 1940s when a wave of people reported seeing strange objects in the skies above America. Indeed, it was in 1947, the term flying saucer entered the popular consciousness after Pilot Kenneth Arnold witnessed several brightly-lit saucer-like objects waving in and out of distant mountain peaks while he was flying in Washington State. This was the first wave of UFO sightings. However, an earlier wave occurred in Britain in 1909 when hundreds of people described flying objects shaped like dirigibles and emitting beams of light carrying out extremely advanced maneuvers overhead. A decade later, throughout 1896 and 97, there was a rash of similar sightings in the United States, but these weren't the first accounts of alien spacecraft on record. Legends of godlike beings coming from the heavens exist in many cultures. Throughout North America, there are numerous caves that date back thousands of years. These paintings, figures, and objects much like the modern imagery of alien and flying saucers. One intriguing legends comes from the First Nations people of central Ontario. Their Sky Man tale may in fact be one of the earliest alien encounters on record. According to the story recorded in 1917 by Colonel G.E. Laidlaw, 500 years ago there was a large village, about 550 native people living somewhere in that region. One day a pair of them stumbled upon a stranger sitting on the grass in a field. This figure, a male, was notably clean and shining bright. The natives approached the stranger and asked who he was and how he came to be in the field. "I am not one of you, I do not belong to this land. "I drop down from above," the stranger explained. Showing unusual hospitality, the Ojibwa invited him back to their village. The stranger agreed but on one condition. "Go home and clean the place where I will stay "and when you come back for me, "I will go with you for a few days." Agreeing, the Ojibwa men went back to their community, told their fellow villagers about their experience, and cleaned the hut where they would house the Sky Man. The stranger did in fact accompany them to their village, but he was clearly restless. He watched the skies often and told people that in two days something would come and get him to take him back to the sky. One afternoon, Sky Man looked up and said, "It is coming." The villagers craned their necks and turned their eyes above and saw something that looked like a bright shining star streaking down from the heavens and hover near the ground. This was the most beautiful thing any of them had ever seen. Sky Man entered the shining star and disappeared from view. The shining star then shot back into the sky and faded away. This tale seems to be a description of an encounter with an ancient astronaut as seen in many cultures and popularized by Swiss theorist Erich von Daniken of Chariots of the Gods fame. Many modern UFO theorists believe Sky Man was a marooned extraterrestrial astronaut whose own craft was somehow damaged or destroyed. They point to the fact Sky Man clearly entered the glowing star as proof the object was a spacecraft of some sort. Was he clean and shining bright because he wore a silvery pressure suit? Did he request his hosts clean his quarters out of fear of contracting human viruses against which he had no immunity? Many researchers believe Sky Man was no mythological tale, but rather an actual encounter of the first kind between an ancient alien and an entire tribal community. Of all the native North American tribes, one appears to have a direct connection to the stars and aliens, that is the Hopi tribes. Hopis call themselves Hopitu, the peaceful people. Hopis meaning good, peaceful, or wise live in the northeastern Arizona area at the southern end of the Black Mesa. A mesa is the name given to a small isolated flattop hill with three steep sides called the first mesa, the second mesa, and the third mesa. On the mesa tops are the Hopi villages called pueblos. Pueblo of Oraibi or the third mesa starting in 1050 and is the oldest in North America that has lived in continuity. Evidence suggests that the Hopi consist of the descendants of various groups that entered the country from the north, the east, and the south, and that a series of movements covered a period of probably three centuries and perhaps considerably longer. Related to people of the various pueblos in the east, the Hopis never actually had a single group identity. They were independent villages sharing with the Zuni and the pueblos a basic culture and view of the sacred while sharing among themselves their own language base. Native Americans believed in constellations. In many cases, they believed in the same formations for stars that we do. Their constellations seemed to be marked by the same knowledge that western civilization on the other part of the globe was aware of. They called them by different names, but the star arrangements are very similar. They believed in maps that have been drawn that they existed at the center of the earth or Turtle Island, that beyond them was the sky, and that beyond the sky were dimensional portals or sky holes as they called them. Beyond the dimensional portals was an area that they call the ocean of pitch where the beauty of the night sky and the galaxies spun out towards them. Beyond that were the boundaries of the universe and that set along the rim at the boundaries of the universe were four different extraterrestrial groups. They believed in Achivas, the sacred ceremonial places to honor the earth. These are the places that Shaman would go into the earth to do their most sacred work. The reason that Achivas are built into the earth for sacred work is because according to legend, at the destruction at each of the ages of mankind, the people that were pure of heart went down into the buxom of the earth and remained there protected. According to them they dwelt in the center of the earth with a group of beings that they call the ant people. Drawings of the ant people are remarkable similar to the gray aliens of today, large heads, little stocky bodies, long spindly fingers, in some cases, four, five, or six digits. Some of these drawings have the indication of telepathic thought waves coming from the beings' heads themselves. The Native Americans believed that the home of the Kachinas was on top of a mountain where there were great cloud formations. Today, some believe that UFO's often hide in what we call lenticular clouds which are cloud formations that seem to be produced to conceal the ships from the visible eye spectrum. Real lenticular clouds move with the rest of the clouds whereas the UFO clouds do not, often sitting five hours in one place. Hopi Indian legends tell of a sure certainty in the future that the tribe's faithful will be lifted to other planets on the day of purification and they watch and wait for the UFOs that will take them there. Is this reminiscent of the Christian version of the rapture? The legend is borne of an ancient rock carving in Arizona depicting a dome-shaped saucer object and maiden that has become a core part of the tribe's religious beliefs. Elders in the Hopi community have said they perceive UFOs as having a direct connection with the old petroglyph drawing and the foretelling of visitors from space who arrive for the Day of Purification. On that day, "All wicked people and wrongdoers will be punished or destroyed," said Chief Dan Katchongva. He said that we believe other planets are inhabited and that our prayers are heard there. The arrow on which the dome-shaped object rests stands for travel through space. The Hopi maiden on the dome-shaped drawing represents purity. Those Hopi who survive purification day will travel to other planets. "We, the faithful Hopi have seen the ships "and know they are true." He said the first division occurred in 1906 when Chief Yukiuma was driven from the old town of Oraibi to Hoteville. "The second division," said the chief, "happened in 1969 when contact was made with a flying saucer "that whispered a message to the tribe." The third division is said to be the precursor of the purification day, and until it arrives, the chief said, "Many Hopi men wear their bang haircuts "that represents a window from which they continue to look "for the true white brother who will arrive "with matching pieces of the stone petroglyph." But the chief won't see the day come or perhaps he will, he's been missing since 1972. Lost to the tribe while walking to a valley where a UFO had been seen. Kachinas are also used in Hopi tribes. They are connected to powerful ancestor spirits called to bring rain to help the crops grow. There are over 300 different Kachinas. There is a prophecy about the return of the Blue Kachina to herald in the fifth age of man. Hopi prophecies are very famous, but as with all prophecies, their timeline became invalid after 1939 when space-time altered. The concepts are fundamentally correct, but the timeline for them to play out is undetermined. The Hopi Indians are the record keepers of the Native Americans. The people of the southwest along with the southeast had full-time religious leaders with shrines or temple buildings. Most Native Americans believe that in the universe there exists an almighty, a spiritual force that is the source of all life. The almighty belief is not pictured as a man in the sky, but is believed to be formless and exist in the universe. The sun is viewed as the power of the almighty. They are not worshiping the sun, but praying to the almighty and the sun is a sign and symbol for that. Native Americans show less interest in an afterlife unlike the Christians. They assume the souls of the dead go to another part of the universe where they have a new existence carrying on everyday activities like they were still alive, they are just in a different world. The religious and ceremonial life of the Hopi centers in the kiva, which is simply a room, wholly or partly subterranean and entered by way of ladder through an opening in the flat roof. While the membership of the kiva consists principally of men and boys from certain clan or clans, there is no case in which all the members of a kiva belong to one clan, a condition inseparable from the provision that a man may change his kiva membership and in fact made necessary by the existence of more clans than kivas. It is probable, nevertheless, that originally the kivas were clan institutions. Further south in Central America, there are mysteries that have befuddled modern man for centuries. Around the year 900 BC, something new had appeared in the jungles and wilderness of what is now Guatemala and Southern Mexico, civilization. For about the next 2,000 years that civilization flourished. The Maya built cities, invested in farming and in trade, and created a calendar. The population soared with some estimates suggesting that there were, at one time, as many as 22 million Mayans. There were farmers, merchants, performers, students, artists, musicians and then at some point it seemed as if the whole Mayan civilization simply vanished. Mayan cities were abandoned, the people's traditions forgotten, and their languages lost forever. What made them leave and where did they go? Some experts think the Maya were victims of a natural disaster, perhaps a massive earthquake or a volcanic eruption, but the cities left behind by the Maya were intact, none of the temples or stone buildings had any mark of damage. Other historians blame drought and famine. The Maya were good farmers, but as their population grew, it became harder to feed everyone and so, the theory goes, they left their cities behind in search of food. Other researchers suggest that the Maya destroyed themselves, perhaps through a civil war, but there are no records of such a conflict in the records they left behind. In 2012, the Mexican government released some never-seen-before Mayan artifacts, statue, masks, plaques, and documents found in the inner spaces of a temple in Mexico. They claimed, rather startlingly, that the Maya had apparently had contact with extraterrestrials. "We believe for certain that aliens worked with the Mayans," said Luis Augusto Garcia Rosado, the minister of tourism for the Mexican state of Campeche. Was it possible that the Maya were themselves space travelers and that when they disappeared, they quite simply gone back to their home planet? Throughout Mayan history, its rulers often claimed to be descended from the stars and the planets. One such king, Pakal of Palenque came to the throne when he was 12 and ruled for the next 68 years until his death at the age of 80. In a time without modern medicines, the very fact he lived to such an age is surprising in itself, in humans, at least, But even more surprising is the ruler's tomb. When Pakal was buried, a unique design was carved into the lid of his sarcophagus. It appears to show the king sitting in a type of cockpit. Could that be an oxygen mask on his face, levers in his hands and pedals at his feet? Outside the cockpit is a flame shooting from an exhaust, Was this very detailed illustration meant to depict the king returning to the mother planet? What's perhaps most startling is that this is a tomb that was carved over a thousand years ago. How could Mayan people have created images of space travel if they hadn't seen it? Others believe that the Mayans' huge temples aligned with solar and lunar activity, they were in fact some sort of ancient landing pads for spaceships or a way of communicating with beings on other planets. For believers, this explains how the Mayans had such advanced knowledge for their time. Was extraterrestrial intelligence the reason for their advanced farming techniques? And why did they appear to have such in-depth understanding of the solar system including planets yet to be discovered? Astrophysicist Carl Sagan argues that while many legends, artifacts, and purported out-of-place artifacts were cited in support of this ancient astronauts idea, very few require more than a passing mention and can easily be explained more conventionally. Still, there has yet to be a definitive. Using the Mayan calendar, doomsday theorists predicted the end of the world was scheduled for 21st of December 2012. Those who believed that the calendar gave the date of the end of the world had theories as to how we would meet our doom such as a mysterious planets on a collision course with Earth or a reverse in the Earth's rotation. Some gathered at ancient Mayan sites to await the end, others stocked up on water and canned goods hoping to survive. The day passed without incident and it seems we're still here. The modern notion that humankind may have been influenced in ancient times by an intelligence far exceeding our own is not only popular, it's almost enigmatic to western culture. Among the faithful believers in paleo-contact as Carl Sagan termed it, mankind's earliest innovations were the result of an alien intervention, either by beings who showed us techniques that could lead to the formation of a civilized society or by direct manipulation of our genetic substructure for purposes of speeding along the natural evolutionary process. The paleo-contact approach is most often invoked by those who seek to find common ground between UFO reports, abduction encounters, and the mythologies of ancient Indians. However, a recent book on the subject, Encounters With Star People, looks at the phenomenon from both an historic perspective as well as from the standpoint that modern day encounters with what many Natives call Star People are still occurring today. Ancient astronaut theorists maintain that Star People have been visiting Earth since the beginning of time. To support their claims, they often portray the legends of American Indian tribes as proof of human interaction with the Star People. There are also many Modern stories of UFO encounters, crashes, and extraterrestrials by adventurers, cowboys, military men, and miners in the Northern Plains. One of the stories described in the book details the story of Chauncey, an aging Native, whose story is a strange encounter with a spaceman who kindly attempted to take Blue Son, his faithful family dog. The story goes that a small exploration craft, some variety of small UFO, had apparently landed behind a butte near Chauncey's home and subsequently a thin, ghostly pale man appeared who apparently conversed with him. After their visit, Chauncey and Blue Son walked the visitor back to his vessel. At which time the alien being was said to have taken interest in the fact that the dog obeyed when Chauncey commanded it to heel. At this point, the spaceman gestured in such a way as to suggest that the creature board his vessel and join him. At which point Chauncey had laid his gun across his arm, merely as a measure of intimidation, expressing that the visitor be along his way and without Chauncey's dog. The more modern reports of alien interaction and UFO sightings detailed in the book are all very unique in this regard, especially since they often seem to express an ongoing interaction between Natives and the Star People to the point that almost becoming commonplace in their culture and society. A number of reports also appear in the book that cover aspects of ufology that have more conventional parallels including UFOs hovering over weapons sites, underground bases, alien abduction, and popular myths associated with space-faring alien beings working as liberators of humankind in some capacity. If you have seen the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, then you're familiar with Devils Tower in Wyoming. It's the first national monument declared in 1906 by President Theodore Roosevelt. The name Devils Tower came from an 1875 mistranslation of a Native American name for the site. It was mistakenly said that the name in English meant Bad God's Tower which was twisted into Devils Tower. Native American tribes had many different names for the site which included Aloft on a Rock, Grizzly Bear's Lodge, Bear's Teepee, and the Tree Rock among others. Devils Tower has been a sacred site for Native Americans since they happened open it centuries ago. Different tribes have different stories, but they're all very similar. The Lakota and the Kiowa tell a tale of two young girls who while out playing were spotted by several enormous bears who began to give chase. The girls, in an attempt to escape, climbed to the top of Devils Tower, and then fell to their knees and prayed to the Great Spirit to save them as the bears began to scale the rocks behind them. The Great Spirit raised the rock to the heavens and as the cliff grew steeper, the bears fell backwards, their claw marks as they tried to hang on being the ridges on the side of the tower. Once the rock reached the sky, the girls were turned into stars, the constellation we know today as the Pleiades. There are dozens of stories, legends, and myths surrounding Mount Shasta in northern California, adding to its mystery and allure. The Native Americans have always felt that the mountain was the sacred center of the universe. They even have stories that talk about it being the home of the creator. Mount Shasta straddles the territories of the Shasta, Wintu, Achumawi, Atsugewi and Modoc tribes. Not surprisingly, the imposing mountain shows up in a lot of tribal myths and stories. It's especially important to the Wintu tribe who trace their people's origin back to a sacred spring on the mountain. They have always done their sacred ceremonies there and they continue to do them to this day. Every August they do their ceremonies for just the tribe and their invited guests. Finally, there's the legend of Telos. According to researchers, Telos is a crystal city inside the mountain inhabited by higher-dimensional beings called Lemurians from the ancient continent of Lemuria that was in the north Pacific Ocean many thousands of years ago. As the story goes, Lemuria and Atlantis got into a thermonuclear war and sank their continents. The Lemurians fled into Mount Shasta and that's where they've remained ever since. Stories from the 1940s say the Lemurians were actually seen walking into town. They were seven feet tall, dressed in long white robes and sandals. They went to the general store to buy supplies and paid for their purchases with chunks of gold. The shopkeeper would take the gold, turn around and try to give them change, and the Lemurians would be gone. Today, no one reports eyewitness accounts of Lemurians in the flesh, but some locals believe the smooth, saucer-shaped lenticular clouds that often gather at the summit of Mount Shasta are engineered by the Lemurians to camouflage alien cargo ships docking at Telos. From seven foot tall Lemurians, we visit the smaller ant people. The Hopi Indians have been living in the high desert of Arizona for thousands of years. They are the direct descendants of the mysterious Anasazi, the Ancient Ones, a civilization that flourished between the 5th and 13th century AD before suddenly disappearing. According to legend, they were led to their current home by a curiously shaped cloud during the day and a moving star by night. During the third cycle, the Hopi describe a period during which the earth ruled by an advanced civilization that had technology far superior to our own. A key element in these legends is represented by the flying shields, the patuwvotas. The advanced flying shields had the ability to travel quickly between distant places and they also carried fearsome weapons that could level entire cities. They are strikingly similar to what we call today unidentified flying objects. In Hopi legend, the world has gone through several phases or cycles already and we are in this time living in the fourth world. In the original world which was according to legend destroyed by fire, the benevolent alien ant people sequestered everyone underground with them and shared what they had. The people were safe from the fire and destruction above. It is said that the ant people even sacrificed their own food to aid the people. As the sky god Sotuknang systematically destroyed the world above, the people waited patiently for the fires to burn and the earth to cool before they came up. When the earth was completed, the sky god gave them blessings and told them to love and nurture the earth, so that destruction was not warranted again. The ant people took their place as ants and new life began in the second world. Humanity being what it is, there have been two worlds destroyed since then and this, the fourth world, is set for the appearance of the fifth and final world. This can be compared to the Christians awaiting the rapture where the creator comes back and the ultimate world begins. This was prophesied to happen near the Blue Kachina or the blue star appeared. This was to signify the end of the fourth world and would be foretold by the kachinas removing their masks and becoming one with the powerful beings they are said to represent. In another part of the world, drawings and carvings support the theory of a race of beings that were here to teach humanity about the land in ancient Sumeria. This race was believed to be superior and was thought to originate from the skies. It was through their teachings that the Sumerians were able to learn how to live in the world and take care of it until the gods of creation returned. Just like the Ant People of the Hopi, they were there to teach mankind about their planet and how to use its resources. An interesting note is that the Hopi word for ant is Anu. The word for friends is Naki. There is also the similar pronunciation of the Hopi ancestors, the Anasazi. Again, we see this phrase in another belief in another part of the world. The depictions of the ant people closely resembled the grays in modern ufology. Whether there is an actual connection between the Hopi of the Southwest and the ancient Sumerians and Egyptians or not, it certainly gives one pause that creation stories were very similar. It also makes the point that celestial communication has been a curiosity of mankind for much longer than UFO sightings in the 20th century. UFO skeptics and believers are locked in a fierce debate over the existence of aliens once again following three apparent sightings recently. Sightings have been caught on camera in Chile, Bolivia, and Brazil and it's fair to say a lot of people are losing their minds over them. The latest of these sightings was filmed in the Chilean capital of Santiago with four glowing orbs seen hovering above skyscrapers in the city. It has been viewed over 100,000 times and has split the online community on whether it's actually genuine. Commentators on YouTube were quick to give their opinion with many believing that an alien invasion is in the cards. While others thought it was either military planes or helicopters, neither seemed entirely convincing. This came after more eerie footage emerged earlier in the month in a rural neighborhood in Bolivia where a giant flying saucer was captured on film above mountains in El Alto, a city in the northwest Bolivian region of La Paz. The clip shows an unusually shaped object flying through the sky before disappearing and then reappearing in the clouds. It was uploaded to a UFO spotting website dedicated to gathering evidence of alien sightings and has now been shared worldwide. Cynics believe that the footage is a hoax to increase online traffic for the filmmaker's website and has simply been created using a digital editing program. Believers were getting yet another chance of hope in southern Brazil, too, when a very similar looking UFO appeared in their skies. The Express reports a woman named Marmel posted a picture online showing another blurred disc-shape in the sky which she didn't even notice while taking a scenic photo. Could this be evidence that the Kachinas are returning? South America has some of the most amazing UFO encounters on record. Especially remarkable is the sheer variety of the sightings which range from straightforward accounts of flying objects to abductions, landings, cattle mutilation, as well as contactee accounts and strange beings that emerge from oddly-shaped craft. In addition, there are particularities to these sightings that are uniquely South American twists to the tales that are to be found on no other continent. Undoubtedly, the best one of the South American encounters occurred in 1957. A Brazilian farmer by the name of Villas Boas was working his fields with a tractor when he claims he was abducted by aliens and taken aboard a spacecraft. There he claims to have had intercourse with a beautiful fair-skinned girl with high cheekbones, a very pointed chin, and vivid blue Chinese-type slant eyes who stood about 4 feet 8 inches high without helmet. The case was thoroughly investigated and researchers admitted feeling impressed at the clarity of Boas evidence. In the ensuing months and years, the details were checked and rechecked by dozens of separate people without revealing any contradiction into the nature of the farmer's story. As such it merits its notoriety as one of the most riveting abduction accounts on record. Significantly the Villas Boas incident is far from being the only reported case of abduction within that same providence of Minas Gerais. In fact, this is a region which according to Jerry Randles has one of the highest concentrations of claimed abduction anywhere in the world In August 1962 for example, there was an incident that made even the Boas case look tame. Unfortunately on this occasion, the victim did not survive to tell the tale. Briefly the facts are these. On the 19th of that month, two glowing red spheres the size of footballs are reported to have flown over the hut of a poor diamond prospector named Rivalino Mafra da Silva. Later two aliens approximately 1.5 feet in height entered the hut and peered at the family as they lay in bed. The next day one of the man's sons was surprised to discover two strange balls beside the hut. One was entirely black and the other black and white. When the father came out to look at them, they apparently rose up at him and enveloped him in a cloud of yellow smoke. He was never seen again. Shortly afterwards, the son was reported to have been taken into custody by the Brazilian army, some say as a means of silencing him. Another astonishing encounter occurred in 1973 near the town of Catanduva, Brazil. The 70s were to prove the heyday of South American encounters and this is perhaps one of the most sensational. A traveling salesman returning home in a torrential downpour suddenly found his car radio cut out on him, followed shortly afterwards by the engine of his car. Almost immediately a blinding beam of blue light then shone down from above, and overwhelmed by a great sense of heat, the driver panicked and fled from the car. The salesman was later to testify that his vehicle became transparent and his skin began to burn as he lapsed into unconsciousness. Hours later he was discovered spread-eagled in the road by people in a passing car who called the police. Taken to hospital he was quickly discharged, but later strange blotches developed on his abdomen. The examining doctors opinion was that they were caused by strange rays. The amazing corollary to this story is that a year later the same man disappeared for six days before being found over 500 miles away sitting on a hill completely soaked. He later claimed to have been abducted by aliens and medically examined aboard a UFO. Then as before doctors were impressed by his lucidity and were happy to pronounce him fully compos mentis. In 1965, around 50 Indians of the Toba tribe were astonished to see three tall beings emerge from two saucer-like craft that came down close to the Argentinian town of Formosa, near the border with Paraguay. The beings appeared to have luminous haloes around their bodies and the Indians knelt down and worshiped them. Witnesses speak of verbal contact being established with the aliens who informed the Indians that the Space People would eventually come in greater numbers. An Indian who made a close approach to the craft was warned off and eventually the beings returned to the craft which took off in a dazzling burst of light. Police who hurried to the scene are believed to have taken numerous photographs which are reputed to show at least three landed saucers and five aliens. Beings that emerged from an egg-shaped craft assured a local hunter that before long the whole world would come to know them. The hunter named Felipe Martinez claims to have met the aliens on no fewer than three occasions. The first time in 1949, he ran toward a hovering object revolving above the trees only to be paralyzed by a mysterious burst of energy. From a door in the object, a small being then descended down a ladder. Standing no more than a meter in height, the being was described as wearing a helmet and clothes like a diver's costume. In an interview, Martinez claims to have been taken aboard one of the alien vessels which oddly was piloted by a crew of four beings around a meter in height and another blonde haired being just over six feet tall. He claims to have been placed in a space suit, but this had an alarming effect on his heart-rate and the suit was quickly removed. Conversation with the aliens was slow and difficult, but according to Martinez the alien's name for their craft was a sil. In 1963 in Parana State, Brazil, a crowd of onlookers was amazed to see a bright zinc-colored object descend into the flames of a major forest fire. Even more astonishing was that after quarter of an hour several tall beings were seen to emerge from the craft and strode around in the flames completely untouched by the furnace-like heat that surrounded them. Even more perplexing was the fact that the beings seemed intent on collecting charred rocks and other material from the fire which they then took back to the waiting space ship. This done, the craft then departed as silently as it came. Witnesses described it as a basin shaped craft, 35 meters in diameter and around eight meters in height, In 1954, near the Venezuelan capital Caracas, two men claimed to have wrestled with a hairy creature that was seen to emerge from a luminous craft. One of the men Gustav Gonzalez says he was thrown 15 feet through the air by a tiny dwarf-like creature who despite its size possessed incredible strength. It also proved impervious to a knife blade thrust. Gonzalez who lunged at the creature with a sharp knife saw to his astonishment that the blade just glanced off the body as though made of steel. Apparently angered the creature's eyes literally glowed in the dark, sending out a blinding flash of light that left both men dazzled and disoriented. Before the craft took off, Gonzalez's friend noticed that two other creatures of similar description were gathering earth and rocks and loading them aboard the hovering sphere. The craft was reportedly 10 feet in width and throughout the incident remained hovering just several feet from the ground. When later examined in hospital, Gonzalez was found to have several deep red scratch marks down his side. For several days afterwards he remained under heavy sedation as both men struggled to come to terms with their terrifying ordeal. Barely two weeks later, a similar incident occurred in the same locality. On this occasion, two young hunters came across a luminous machine around 10 feet wide hovering just two feet from the ground. Four or five beings were seen to emerge from the craft and then attempted to drag both youths inside. Fighting them off as best they could, one of the young men lashed out with his rifle butt bringing it down on the head of one of the aliens. Incredibly the weapon broke into fragments as if it had been struck on a rock. Finally managing to break free of the aliens, both youths ran off to summon police who later reported signs of a struggle. As in the previous incident, both youths required hospital treatment and remained in a highly agitated state for some time afterwards. In Argentina, the year 1965 brought a series of abortive abduction attempts where aliens attempted to take people by force. The national press published numerous reports of these incidents which bear evidence of a widespread trend of which relatively few cases were adequately investigated. Of those that were, an incident in the province of Corrientes tells of five luminous craft observed flying low overhead. One vessel proceeded to land near a farm house and five beings around two meters tall were then seen to emerge. On their heads were instruments giving off flashes of light. The focus of the beings attention was immediately directed at the farmhouse. Forcing their way inside, they attempted to overpower the owner and drag him away. Fighting the aliens as best he could, the farmer eventually broke free of his attackers who fled when other villagers rushed to his assistance. Several days later, the aliens returned and attempted to abduct another man. Once again villagers turned out in force, firing rifles which although not able to injure the aliens was sufficient to drive them away again. The association of Latin America with sky visitors who arrive from the stars goes back thousands of years. To native Indian cultures these beings brought with them the rudiments of civilization, initiating major developments in science, agriculture, astronomy, and masonry. By the shores of Lake Titicaca, the ancient ruins of Tiahuanaco bear a mysterious reflection of these ancient beliefs. Here the imposing Gate of the Sun contains enigmatic hieroglyphs that some have interpreted as advanced astronomical data. The best selling author Erich Von Daniken found the place highly indicative of alien influence. He wrote, What does legend say "about the mysterious city of Tiahuanaco? "It tells of a golden ship "that came from the stars," he continues. "What titantic forces where at work here and to what end? Von Daniken concludes, "What secret does this city conceal? "What message from other worlds awaits its solution "on the Bolivian plateau?" Equally evocative of mysterious influence are the Nasca lines etched in the Peruvian desert close to the town of Ica. Here dead straight lines traverse the desert for dozens of miles. Other shapes include depiction's of monkeys, whales, and decorative birds. At ground level, the patterns are barely perceptible and only really become apparent when viewed from the air. Since the antiquity of the lines goes back thousands of years, the question has been asked and re-asked, why would an ancient people go to such immense effort to construct a line system only visible from the air? Who was meant to see it? Inevitably Von Daniken saw the answer in terms of aliens. He interpreted the lines as markers or landing strips for alien spacecraft. While this may appear a farfetched explanation, the Indians of that area have other ideas. Their traditions frequently make mention of strange visitors who descend from the sky aboard fiery craft. Visitations which they insist have carried on down to this present day. There has always been a connection between Native Americans and beings from other parts of the universe, referred to as star people or visitors from space. In Utah's nine mile canyon lies the heaviest concentration of rock art in the world. These depict beings that appear to be not quite completely human. They can be seen next to a disc-shaped object. Other beings of a more human form are raising their hands to these beings near the object Near Christina Lake, British Columbia, Canada, there is a picture of a white disc with black wings hovering over four human figures on their knees. There are lines coming from the top of the disc which could be rays of light. Longer, more irregular lines come down from the bottom of the object. A rock painting at Cayuse Creek, Idaho depicts what appears to be a cone-shaped rocket with smoke or flames trailing behind it. In the cone is a humanoid figure apparently holding on to the inner walls. A pictograph near Kootenay Lake in British Columbia also shows an enclosed vehicle holding a single humanoid figure. It depicts what appear to be sections of the vehicle and two objects closely resembling retractable legs for landing. Numerous depictions of egg-shaped objects with wavy lines emanating from them have been found. These could be an effort to show the object in motion or some sort of light or heat. If this were to depict the sun, lines would typically be found all around the circumference of the circle. In these cases, they come only from the bottom side. In certain Cherokee legends said that their people originated in the Pleiades long, long ago. They claim to have come to this world as star seeds to bring light and knowledge. If the stories are true, then modern day Cherokee as well as other Native Americans and many of us with Native American blood contain Pleiadian genes. Many native legends place either their origins or visitation from the Pleiades, it's possible that within this star cluster, there are planets where life could exist. Scientists say it's very plausible. Analyzing deep infrared images obtained by the Spitzer Space Telescope and Gemini North telescope, astronomers discovered that one of the cluster's stars, HD 23514, which has a mass and luminosity a bit greater than that of the Sun is surrounded by an extraordinary number of hot dust particles and this could be evidence for planet formation around the star. Other stars with the cluster also have sunlight characteristics. The cluster is only about 118 parsecs away from Earth. Is it possible that aliens from another star system came to Earth ages ago and helped the tribal people of our planet? Evidence around the world seems to suggest it is not only possible, but that it indeed happened. Ancient astronaut theorists point to many artifacts and structures that early man could not have created. Wall paintings depict the arrival and association of the star people all across the Southwest, having visited in circular vehicles and bringing man safety and even technology. Many tribes believe that they are either star people or are descended from them. Native people are often shy about talking about extraterrestrials. Their race has endured much over the years and they do not want to share many of their sacred beliefs. Many of their believes have been lost as well over time or only a few elders know the legends of their people. Suffice it to say, there is an abundance of evidence that early tribes of natives did indeed have contact with one or more races from the stars. Almost all of them say that one day when the world is ready, these star people will return. Perhaps then all who inhabit this planet, the natives of our Earth will be ready, physically, mentally, and spiritually, to greet these ancient travelers from the stars.
