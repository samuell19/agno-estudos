Kang Si Year 50, 4th Prince Wan Zing Who later became Emperor Yung Cheng... just had one daughter. But the princes kept fighting for succession They used every resort to achieve their aims. Kang Si Wanted the croWn prince to be smart. Also, there Was the question of his grandsons Deciding the croWn-prince Was a long term issue. If the croWn prince Was dead... the grandson Would become the emperor. By a fortunate coincidence... Chen Sai Gun had a son that night. Pretending to have a look, Yung Cheng asked... for the baby and made a sWap. When the maid took the baby out... the son had become a daughter! The son of Chen Would later... go on to become the Emperor Chien Lung When this story unfolded... Chien Lung had been on the throne for 1 8 years One night... Hung Hua Society Chief, Yu Wan-ting along With No. 4 Chief Wen Tai-lai sneaked into the palace and Wanted to discuss With Chien Lung. After they left, for no apparent reason Chien Lung issued out a decree... ordering Chang Chao-chung to kill them. Yu Wan-ting died from illness on the Way Which left Wen T ai-lai... to flee alone. When he reached On T ong lnn... Wu T ang's sWordsman Lu Fei-Ching and his felloW student Li Yuan-tzu passed by accompanied his Dad to Work... in Hai Ning. Moreover, Hung Hua Society's No. 14 incharge... Yu Yu-tong folloWed. With the help of Lu... and Li... Wen fought With Chang and Was saved.

The other group Will be led by 3rd brother Mrs Wen, 7th brother 8th and 1 0th Brother, Mr Chou and daughter... Will start off from northeast for HangchoW Why our ex-Chief suddenly told Chief to come back and 4th Brother Was caught? Didn't the ex-Chief tell 2nd, 5th and... Last time the ex-chief Wanted 2nd, 5th and... 6th Brothers to go to Beijing With him? Suddenly one night... he told me secretly... that he and 4th Brother... got things to discuss With Chien Lung. This is about anti-Ching campaign. They Were prepared to go to the frontier But Chief became critically ill on the Way He then ordered Priest Wu Chan to take 5th and 6th Brothers... and bring back Chief. On the other hand he ordered 4th Brother that... he must tell the secret of Chien Lung... to Chief in person. It is crucial to restore Han's regime. No one except Chief should knoW. Therefore 4th Brother didn't tell me. No Wonder Chien Lung caught 4th Brother He got scared that the secret Will be revealed But because of this... 4th Brother is safe noW. HoW are your injuries? It's nothing. Don't fuss over a minor injury Chi Erh, you... Oh yeah? HoW about letting me stab you then? You dare to? I don't think so. Stop. We are noW a family. Let bygones be bygones.

Someone has entered 7th brother's room Father is here Did you see it yourself? Yes, I did Go in at once then What is it, Mr Chou? Brothers They said someone Went into 7th Brother's room. Right. Go in and see SWordsman Hsu What is it? Someone Went into your room? No I really saw someone going there. It smelt like rouge poWder Oh yeah Did you apply some rouge? No, I haven't applied it for half a year It's good that no one has come here If there is a lady caught hiding in your bed... she'll remain unmarried... if people knoW of it. What are you saying? He already said no. He'd knoW... if someone's hiding, right? You guys leave! Wait Why do you have three feet? You... Father What is going on? It is very simple. Miss Chou is too shy... to convey her love. T onight she came in secretly... to propose to him She Wanted 7th Brother to marry her. Mr Chou, We... They Were both naked in bed. You are a man With conscience. Though she is bad-tempered and ugly... I... hoW can this ugly Woman... find a husband after tonight? You... 3rd Brother, please do something People Will say... Hung Hua Society has a rapist. Well, Mr Chou Let me be the matchmaker. On behalf of 7th let me speak for her marriage. What do you say? What're you doing? Who says I'd Want to marry that kid?

I am a scholar, Without a stable home. I don't Want to be an official. Most officials are good for nothing. They only knoW hoW to bully people. You share most of the scholars' vieW.

I'm here specially to visit her. Your surname is not Lu. You are Chen Sai Gun's son. Yes. And you? Why did you come to my parent's grave? T o tell you frankly I am a court official. Your father did favors to Ching court. They sent me to HangchoW to his grave. Well You're a premier's descendant Why didn't you Work for Ching court? Why be a Wanderer? Is there any reason? We met twice today. I believe it is fate. But you are an official. I am a Wanderer. People have different vieWs. Forget it. But I feel you have something unsolved. I have Worked at the court for a long time. Just tell me. Maybe I can help you. You have hawk-eyes. Good! HoWever, this unsolved matter... can only be solved... by the Emperor Is it true? Okay then. I have a jade pendant. If you have any problem... just take it to see the Emperor. He Will help you. Although I knoW nothing about jade... I believe this is a treasure. I am humble Without anything precious... Okay I Will give you this folding fan. The fan contains The Gold-Thread Song. Better not listen to the slander. Let your mind rest. The poet Was rather a bit arrogant So he had a short life. Life is like a dream. No matter What your achievement is. People die When the time comes. Why bother to care? It's getting cold.

Go ahead and say it. After the Chief left the palace, did he tell you What he planned to tell me? Regarding? About my life. No Did he say... Why he Wanted to see me? He only said Hung Hua Society is lacking funds. He Wanted 3 million silver ingots from you. Is that it? Right. But I couldn't imagine that... I Would be detained by you... Without lending the money. If this is only a misunderstanding... I Will release you after investigation. Your Highness. T ake him back. Why are there no guards?

We must Wait for Chien Lung... to leave the palace. He'll be accompanied by top fighters. We should be prepared first. Ask Ma Sin-kWan to dig a tunnel Which... Ieads to the fountain in yamen garden. We'd also ask 3rd Bro and Mr Lu to... prepare explosives... on the Way to Y amen. On the day of our assault... Ma Will take his men, disguised... as Wine hawkers in front of Y amen. Mr Chou and 9th... brother Will Walk from South Gate disguised as cigarette hawkers. They Will meet in front of yamen. When you get there, Don't let others pass... and start fighting You pour oil on the Wood and burn it. Sir, two groups of vendors had a fight outside The gate is on fire. Go and put it out.
