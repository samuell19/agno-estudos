This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. Ah. Good morning. Ooh. Ah ah ah ah ah. Don't touch. Oh, Jen, come on. It's okay. I don't mind if they're not iced yet. There are 24 people in my office, Carla. If everyone has two, and Neil in Accounting will totally have three, there won't be enough. To thank my boss Tony for recommending me for the Head Game Creator position. Or you could tell Tony that you got up at 4 AM, showered, got dressed, nailed your grandmother's sugar cookie recipe, all before 7 AM. I mean, they should give it to you for just organizational prowess alone. Except my friend Jennifer Holloway doesn't exactly speak up at work. I speak up. When? Today. Shannon! In the kitchen. Hi. Thank goodness. Oh no! You look so nice. It's okay, okay. You must have somewhere important that you're supposed to be. It's fine, it's fine. Sorry, I just couldn't afford to call a plumber for the 10th time. That's not a problem, Shannon. Just gimme the thing. What am I gonna do with a hammer? Haven't had a coffee yet today or a shower because the house decided it was more important for it to have a shower than me. And the water heater is making weird noises again so that's probably gonna- Okay it's done. Done? Really? Yeah, it's okay. I got ya. Let's go get you one of Dad's shirts. I won't keep calling. Stop. Call any time, seriously. You have a job. And you have a full-time business and a child. Speaking of that child... Uncle Aidan. Emma, you were supposed to be dressed 10 minutes ago. We're gonna be late. Why are you here, Uncle Aidan? Did something else break down? No. Your house is perfect and beautiful just like you. Why? You wanna go break something? Okay, that's enough. Let's go. Come on, missy. Have fun, you little tiny human. But you're coming back to do the wreaths tonight. And whatever else needs doing, yeah. Hey, wait. You're not the only big deal in this family. I'm also a big deal. I have a very important meeting today. Wish me luck. Good luck. You didn't get my email? What email? The one I sent this morning to everybody announcing that Tony quit. What? That company in Minneapolis called on Friday and offered him the job. Alastair was so ticked that he paid Tony's severance and let him go on the spot. Do I smell cookies? Grandma Sue's sugar cookies. My favorite. Tony's too. They were supposed to be his thank you for putting in a good word with Alastair. But, you know, you should talk to him yourself. And say what? Since you've started, you've worked really hard. I mean, you're detailed, people love you and your scavenger hunts, and, I mean, you would be the perfect person for that Game Creator position. Oh, Anne, can you just talk to him? I mean, say exactly what you just said. Hey, there is nothing wrong with standing up for yourself and asking for what you want. See, that rolled perfectly off your tongue. Jennifer, you're a people person. I mean, you're so good in front of people until they're in charge of you. You've told me over and over how much you want this job and Alastair is gonna make his decision before Christmas so it's speak now or forever hold your peace time. You're right. I don't need Tony. I'm going in there right now. That a girl. Oh, I will hold onto those. Okay. I'll just send an email. Big Bill, are you ready to go? No, honey. Just try to stay comfortable. And hey, if anything changes, just text me, okay? I love you too. Goodbye. Everything okay? Heather's due any day. She's having Braxton Hicks contractions so I don't even know if she's in labor. Should I go home? No, presentation's important. And she's not actually in labor. Right? I don't know anything about what you just said. But do you wanna go to this meeting? Yeah. Can't believe I'm gonna be a dad. None of us can. What? I'm kidding. You're gonna be an incredible father. Can't think of a better Christmas gift. You good? Yeah, absolutely. Good. Do I look okay? Yeah, you're a superstar, just a little bit distracted. No, no, I'm 100% focused. Hold on. It's Heather. What are you doing? Are you up for this or not? Yeah, I'm good, don't worry. Diapers are my specialty. What? Huh? Diapers are your specialty? No, clients. Clients are my specialty. Aidan, Bill. Good morning, Alastair. Good morning. Great. Wanda Simler, VP of marketing for Devonshire Hotels. Pleasure to meet you, Wanda. You too. Bill and I are very excited to hear about the event. I look forward to hearing what you got. Absolutely. Oh, I'm sorry. Gotta get this. Ah. Well, shall we get started then? Please. You're better than this. Come on. I'm writing because I would like you to consider me for the Head Game Creator position. The reason I should be Head Game Creator is... I should just go talk to him, right? So the way an online scavenger hunt works is the participants download an app that we create on their phone. On the day of the hunt- On the day of the hunt, they receive an alert the game is going live and a clue pops up. I've been down this road. The head of the Devonshire has also been down this road. She fired our last game company on Friday and our event goes live this Saturday. Yeah, why don't you guys walk Wanda through some of our biggest campaigns so she can get a feel of what kinda hunt she's after and then we can dive right in. Great, we're gonna run you a demo of one of our recent successes. If you just open up the app on that... phone. Do you need to go? Oh, my wife! Uh, Bill, how 'bout you step outside. Aidan, perhaps you could- Walk Wanda through the rest of the app? Absolutely. Here, why don't you take mine? Hardly ever pings at all. What? You sure? Oh, God, okay, I'll be right there. Don't worry. If you'll excuse me. Aidan, you got the room. Yeah, I'm coming, yeah. I gotta go. Bill, Bill, stop. She's having contractions at two minutes apart. It's gonna be fine. I gotta go. Go! Thank you. Excuse me. Jennifer. So the woman in my office is the marketing director of the newly restored Devonshire Hotel downtown. They've already spent 18 months restoring every inch to preserve its history and now they wanna open with a big splash. They've already fired two companies for not meeting their standards and now she has the impossible deadline of a Christmas scavenger hunt to promote the opening this Saturday. Jennifer, this is our shot to finally attract luxury brands. If we rescue this campaign for Wanda, we get a chance at the entire chain. That's 86 hotels across the country. Any reason you can't step in? Me? Uh... Personal commitments? No. Going on a trip? No. Ghost in the house? No. What? Any reason at all you can't work with Aidan this week and help make this happen? No, I mean, yes. No and yes. Bingo, you're in. Let's go. So Bill's gone home. Meet Jennifer. What? Since our brand already appeals to tourists, our goal is to focus on locals and broaden our clientele. Staycations. Let Chicagoans enjoy their time off in the comforts of the city they know best. That's great. Or introduce those who think they know the city to places they didn't know before. What's that? Who, me? Well, it's just that Chicago is filled with incredible neighborhoods that not everyone's had a chance to explore, each with its own history and holiday traditions. Little Italy, Greektown, Andersonville. We could design the clues so that people get to know the city better with the last clue bringing them to the Devonshire. Unless you all had a different idea. It's terrific. It is terrific. The last clue can bring everyone to the soft opening where they can join our Christmas party. Where the winner gets a prize which you can wrap as a present under your giant Christmas tree. Great idea. Maybe we give away a weekend stay at the coming year. A real staycation. They get the prize that you want them to want. Great. Is there a theme for this party? I thought we'd tie it in to the scavenger hunt. So- A winter wonderland. White snowflakes and fur trees covered in snow. We've seen that before. Jennifer? Uh... could it be "The Twelve Days of Christmas"? Each clue could correspond with a line in the song. Five golden rings, a partridge in a pear tree. Well, partridges aren't really native to the Midwest but- The riddles don't have to be literal. A bird in a tree- Or it could be a hawk, the Chicago Black Hawks hockey team. Which isn't named after a bird. Are you even from here? I'm from Iowa. Oh. Do you have a counterproposal? Do I have a... Yeah, I have a counterproposal. Um... since the song is about gifts from a true love, we choose romantic locations in each of those neighborhoods. The 12 dates of Christmas. There it is! The 12 dates of Christmas. I like her, Alastair. Good call. I'll need 24 Christmas clues for the 12 dates of Christmas in my email by end of day Wednesday. 24 clues? They won't all be winners. We wanna have plenty to choose from. You got it. Here, let me walk you out. Jennifer, walk me out. Of course. Jennifer. Okay. That is a win. You can't take Bill off this project, not with this kind of turnaround. Bill is on paternity leave as of 30 minutes ago. And you need to learn to partner with other people. Don't like other people. Like Bill. Listen, Bill might be your work husband but he's actually Heather's real husband and probably somebody's father right now. And if I was you, I would take this opportunity to get comfortable with other people. You know I work better alone. Let me just, I'm gonna handle this myself. I got it. Don't worry. No, you will team up with Jennifer and not leave her side until you guys come up with at least 36 good ideas. 36? They won't all be winners. All right. Hey. So that was a surprise. Yes it was. But I'm really glad to have this opportunity. Listen, Iowa- Jennifer. What'd I say? Look, I know we haven't worked together before but I assure you I've come up with some great stuff. Uh huh. Jerome's Hardware. I did their team-building hunt and they had so much fun- Right. They wrote me a thank you card and all the employees signed it. Is this your thing, you blurt things out? Oh, well, to tell you truth, sometimes I just get really nervous and I can't help it. But Wanda seemed to like the idea. Jerome's Hardware was an in-person hunt, yes? Yes, around the bean. For what, like 20 people? This one's online for, I don't know, hopefully a few thousand. You know, why don't we just meet in my office to brainstorm. I can put on the song for inspiration and we can- As lovely as that sounds, and it does sound lovely, Bill and I usually work at our own desks and we come up with our ideas. Usually I like to just work in, what's the word, quiet. So maybe we just reconvene tomorrow and we compare notes. Is that okay? Um, fine. Okay. Okay, great. I'm looking forward to it. Hey, Mr. Romano. You need some help? Okay then. Tell me everything. I'm gonna go make tea. So there's one bow. Yeah? Then there's two bows. Two bows. Three bows. Slow down. Four bows. Four, quadruple bows? It's way too many bows. You excited to come to the craft fair? I'm so excited. We're gonna sell so many wreaths. We're gonna be so rich. It's a fundraiser. That's right, that's right. Dad says we need to promote it more this year. Last year we almost didn't make enough money to keep the music program going. You know your dad would be here if he could, right kiddo? Yeah. He was deployed at Christmas three years ago too. Remember that? I do, did you know your mother was your age when we spent Christmas in Okinawa? That's where our dad was stationed. Actually, when I was her age, we were in Belgium. Okinawa was later. Oh yeah, that's right. Your mother's smarter than me. Remember that. Is it true this house is going to be condemned soon? I take it back. What are you doing? She heard me and Dave talking on Skype. I was joking. Do you remember when I said I was joking? It is falling apart. It has its challenges. But your Great Grandpa Jack bought this house long before you or I were even born and he restored it with his own hands. He would never let anything happen to it. All right, Emma, it's time for bed. Say good night to Uncle Aidan. Good night, Uncle Aidan. Jinx. Make a silly face. Yes, there it is. Okay, perfect. These wreaths are amazing. Your fair's gonna be a huge success and we're gonna make so much money. I mean, be generous. Better be. They chose a super lame theme this year. Winter wonderland. I think my work partner hates me. Who could hate you? This guy, Aidan. He's all like, don't bother me. I'm so busy. Look how grumpy I am. Uh, maybe Aidan just doesn't enjoy this time of year. Who doesn't enjoy this time of year? Look, maybe you should bake him something like... oh I see that plan is already in action. Meltaways. Now, that'll warm him up. This is the shot that I've been waiting for. So if I blow it and I don't get promoted to Head Game Creator, my family's for sure gonna say it's time to go back to being an Iowa Hawkeye, which is also not a bird. Really? Grandma Sue. I'm making your Meltaways right now. Hi, Grandma Sue. Muah! And I just finished your ornament. Will you be back home for me to give it to you? Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss Christmas at the farm for anything. You know, I just happened to have a batch of Meltaways dough waiting in the fridge. Roll 'em out together? I'd love that. The sink today, tomorrow who knows. Who would have guessed that Grandpa Jack was an architecture professor. The house is 120 years old. Happy birthday to the house. I know I probably shouldn't say this out loud but are we gonna have to sell? We're not selling the house. I know I don't want to. I'm just worried we might have to. Can't afford to keep fixing it and the foundation issues. Maybe the historical society is interested. Shan. No. Or one of his students. Remember how he used to have them over for Sunday salons? They worshiped him. Stop. We could call Dad. We are not calling Dad. All right, I'm not gonna stress him out. He's got enough to worry about as it is. We are just going to fix the house. He's going to retire here just like we talked about. I know. And I'm gonna keep doing everything that I can until I get the promotion to Head Game Creator, which should be any day. Then I should be able to make everything right, okay? Okay. Okay, I gotta run. I gotta come up with 18 clues for a scavenger hunt from "The Twelve Days of Christmas". Great. That sounds like six clues too many. Exactly right. And I got a new partner to micromanage. A talker. Oh, I know how much you love those. Didn't Alastair say you need to be more open to working with others, you know, so you can actually be considered for the Head Game Creator job? Be more of a people person? You don't have to remember everything I tell you. Actually, as your sister I do. What happened to Bill? Bill's wife had a baby. That's nice. An early Christmas present. It's nice for him but I'm stuck with a green partner. What's the new guy's name? Jennifer. Don't make that face. What? This is just my face. Right. Give her a shot. You never know. She might surprise you. Yeah. Okay. Good night. You said you were loving that job. I do. It's just hard to stand out. Well, you never had trouble with that before or at your old job. It's different in Chicago. Then come home. Grandma. Plus your ornament is waiting. Jenny, there's nothing in Chicago you can't have here. I have a big day tomorrow, Grandma. Can I call you back? You can call me any time. Love you. Good morning. I brought you coffee. Wow, that's really nice. Come on in. Wow, you really go for the minimalist vibe, huh? Yeah. Although that wreath is cute. Did you make it? No, it's my niece's. She made it for a fundraiser for her school. You can take a seat. Yeah. Hey, Aidan. I've got Wanda from the Devonshire Hotel on line one. Are you ready? I mean, I did some work but I thought we had until- Tomorrow. She's probably just checking in. Wanda, hi. Hey, you two. How's it going. Great. It's going good yeah. Really good. We've got a great list of possible places and clues to get us started. Perfect. Why don't you two come down to the hotel, get a feel for the place, and pitch me your ideas over lunch. Lunch? Right. Um... we were actually hoping that we could have more time to combine our lists. We thought we had a day or two. Uh, restaurant's not open yet but I'll let the chef know we wanna do a late lunch. See you at two. No, no, not00. Aidan was saying... We have five hours. Yeah. Better get to work. I think you'll find a lot more inspiration working from my office. Where is your office? Here. Wow, it's like Santa's workshop. I know. Fun, right? Very fun. What's that? Mulling spices. In a few minutes it's gonna smell like apple pie in here. Uh, let me take the board. Sure. You want a cookie? No thank you. Excuse me, pal. So is it like this all the time or just in December? It wouldn't be special if I left it up all year. So how do you wanna do this? Uh, well did you wanna start? Sure. Well, for starters, I thought the app could have a fun Christmas tree design with 12 ornaments representing each hidden clue. So the players open the clue and once they've solved it, they take a picture and post it online. If it's correct, they get sent the next clue. And everyone can monitor the game on our social media page. Yeah, it's very good. It's good. Thanks. So did you come up with any clues? Uh, sure, yeah. 18 clues. Should I... I can read them out loud. No, no. Oh that's fine. Why don't I just take a look? Oh, okay. Right. I can see you put a lot of thought into it. It's just that some of them are impossible. For instance, 11 pipers piping, you suggest people take a photo of Piper's Restaurant. Best pecan pie ever. Closed about a month ago. Owner retired. Oh. Just cross that off. What else? Nine ladies dancing. Yes, so the Radio City Rockettes do nine shows a week at the Chicago Theater till Christmas Eve. Sold out. Since September, yeah, every year. Look, I know you don't really live here- I live here. What do you mean? Oh, for the last few months or whatever- A year and a half. I was close. You're a native so you know the city better. I just thought I might have a good outsider perspective, that's all. Did you like any of them? Yeah. Egg nog milkshakes for eight maids a-milking. That's clever. Yes, yes, so we send them to Old Granor Farm because egg nog originated from farms when farmers had overages. And that little farming community off 94 is one that not many people ever get a chance- Yep, that's okay, I got it, I got it. You can... Anything else? Uh, should we read yours? Yeah, no, I'm just gonna take the white board back to my office. But we're supposed to work together. Yep, you did your part. Thanks for that. No, those were just early pitches. I can actually do this job. Not saying you can't. Just saying I might wanna go back to my office and maybe I have more experience. All right. So let's read yours so I can learn. Yeah, I'm sorry, sure. That's it. Go ahead. Oh, you've got some pretty good ones here too. Five golden rings, the onion rings at Portillo's. Yeah, that's one of Chicago's great treasures. It's not exactly a date though, is it? Eating onion rings together. Onion breath. Yeah, sure. And none of the Portillo's locations are in out-of-the-way or historic neighborhoods like we promised Wanda so... Aidan, you don't have to- Let's just regroup in an hour or two or at the hotel. But shouldn't we be working together? There's just so much decorations and music and cinnamon. Who doesn't like cinnamon? An office shouldn't smell like pie. Look, I've been doing this for a long time, okay, and I just, I know that I work better alone. You know, I've actually done some really great things here. Jerome's Hardware, I know. And the Nurses Association and Sprinter Scooters. Sprinter Scooters? That was you? I've heard good things. So one good thing I did. I'll see you at30. At least take a cookie. Thank you. Hey. Wow. Luxury brand. Alastair was not kidding. This place is incredible. Yeah. These gingerbread houses are real made from pastry chefs from all over the city. Who wants a staycation now? Oh. Wanda's meeting is running over. Wanda's texting you. Yeah. Is she rescheduling? 20 minutes. Walk the property, meet you in the restaurant. Chef's testing the party menu. Hope you're hungry. Okay. Hope there's no cinnamon. It's only cold when I start biking. With the ice and the snow. It is Chicago and it's supposed to be in the teens all week. Ah, I avoid traffic. Never have to dig my car out. Okay. And it's quiet, especially in the morning when no one's around. Ah. There it is. What? You like it best when no one's around. "I prefer to work alone. Bill and I go back to our own desks. You do your thing..." Should I go on? No, you've made your point plenty. Well, I don't mind people who bake cookies. In general or... Yours are very good. I ate 'em. Thank you. I think that's the first nice thing you've said to me. Is that true? I'm sorry. That's terrible. Okay. That is one beautiful blue spruce. Wait. You know trees? Every Christmas, my Grandpa Jack would take us to a tree farm up in Lake County. We got pretty close with the owners and I would always pick the tallest tree I could find and we would chop it down together. He would always pick the blue spruce because his house was made from it. He put his heart and soul into that place. Sounds like a special home. Yep, over a hundred years old. Acts like it too. We used to always put the tree right in the front window so everyone could see in the early mornings. I'm sorry. I'm rambling. I just miss the guy sometimes. Well, count on me getting a blue spruce from now on. That's nice. Hey, speaking of ornaments... Yeah? Did Wanda say what kind of entertainment they were having at the party? I don't think so no. That 12th clue, the one that's meant to bring them here... 12 drummers drumming. I bet there's a school in Chicago with an amazing drum line. Maybe one with some kids that need an extra boost around the holidays? Could make some calls. Get some little drummer boys. And girls. And girls. And their last clue cannot just bring them to the hotel... But bring them to the room where the party is at. That's a good idea. I know. I'm full of them. Can I ask you something? Why is it the ideas that you came up with on your own were- So lousy? Not quite as good as the ones you came up with with Wanda or say here now with me? I work better when I collaborate. Hm. I can't believe I've done it. I found the one thing you don't have in your office. A giant lantern filled with ornaments. You're right. Now you know what to get me for Christmas. Oh, this is more your speed. A quiet little nook. Away from any other human being. Yeah, you know what, you're right, it's nice. It's quiet. It's intimate. Can actually sit, focus on the person sitting across from... You. You know, whoever that is. You can hear what they're saying. You know, I've been here before with my dad. He took me to the roof. It's beautiful. It was before they restored it. Can see the city. I was maybe 14 or 15. But I remember thinking that um... one day I wanna bring my girlfriend here. You should get Wanda to set you up. Yeah, I would if I had someone to bring. I don't have a girlfriend. Okay. It's about that time. You wanna head to the restaurant? Yeah, let's do that. Wow. Oh, you don't have to do- Wanda wanted me to give the two of you the full Devonshire experience. What do you make of the ambience? Romantic, yes? Very. But also great for a business lunch, like this one. Little work, little play. May I bring you the wine list? No, I think we're okay for drinks. Just work today. Exactly, he usually works with Bill but Bill had a baby so here I am. No baby, just two coworkers meeting the client. How much longer will Wanda be? Soon. I'll be out with the food. So do you wanna... Do you wanna go... Sorry. You first. Do you wanna tell me what... You first. Look, believe it or not, the very first turtle race in the United States was right here in Chicago. Seriously? Deadly serious. 1902, Chinatown. The "Chicago Tribune" called it "the strangest race ever run." There's a mural on Wentworth Avenue on the side of a Chinese candy store depicting those two turtles in that fine race. Two turtle doves. Amazing. Plus dove rhymes with love for when we're making the clues so that's brilliant. Why are you here? Excuse me. I'm sorry, I mean in Chicago instead of Iowa. Well, if I said pizza or sports teams. Very good answer but... You really wanna know? I do. Well, they don't have much of this in Clear Lake, Iowa. I mean I love it there. I love my family, all 80 bazillion of them, practically all on the same street. But... They don't understand what I'm doing here in the big city and why I'd leave everything behind to play games. That it makes people happy or helps them grow as a workforce. Tony had faith in me. He said I'd advance within a year. He was even gonna put me up for the Head Game Creator job but he didn't do it before he left so... Head Game Creator? You want that position. Yeah. Well, you know, even if you don't get that specific promotion, there'll be other ones that'll come up, you know. I suppose but if I don't make a show of progress and soon, my family's just gonna keep asking what the point was of leaving home, my grandmother especially. Her whole purpose in life is keeping her family close. Maybe if I don't get the job she's right. I mean, I love the energy here. And the creative work? I love it. But sometimes I do miss home. And sometimes I feel like I don't completely belong here. Right. Cranberry brie tartlets. Roasted Brussels sprouts. We have candied walnut. Beef Wellington. And toasted lobster ravioli. Thank you. This all looks amazing. Enjoy it. I mean, I wanna dive in and eat every last thing. But shouldn't we wait for Wanda? What? Wanda. We only talked about turtles. We didn't compare notes on any of the other clues. It's okay. You've got the drummer corps and the eight maids a-milkin'. Yeah, and you nailed the turtle doves so that leaves us with- Nine, nine more and, Wanda, hi. Here I am. Doesn't this look amazing? Been looking forward to this all day. Oh good. Us too. Ready? Let's dive in and hear what you got. I think the nine ladies dancing turning into couples dance class- With samba or tango or folk. Or belly dancing is my new favorite. All right, I think we'll just flesh out the final four. Does that sound good? Sounds good. Okay. I'm gonna go get the coats. Okay. You're good at this. Well, Aidan and I have gotten in a rhythm of working together and it's been- No, you. You're good at this. Thank you. So why don't you speak up more? What? Can I tell you a secret? When I started in this business, there weren't too many women at the top of my field. I didn't speak up, not because I didn't have confidence in my ideas. I did. But because I was intimidated into staying silent. But you know what? That was on me. You don't lack confidence in your ideas. No, I, I know I'm good at this. Then why aren't you claiming that? All right, so the ones we have left are three French hens, five golden rings, 11 pipers piping... Not doing that again. Well, why don't we get a jump on it, head back to the office? I can work late. Tonight is actually Skype night at my sister's. Skype night? Yeah, my brother-in-law's deployed. It's his one time on the computer. It's time difference. It's a whole thing. Oh, that's fine. Of course. Thanks. We can regroup later, maybe tonight? Why don't we do it first thing tomorrow? Does that work? Okay. Sure. Well, have a safe ride. Okay. Safe drive. Thanks. Hi. Alastair. Oh. You caught me. Your cookies are here. I made those for Aidan. Next time make enough for the rest of the class, will ya? You bet. Alastair? Yeah. I just wanted to let you know that I'm interested in the Head Game Creator position. Jennifer, I already have four candidates. Why should I throw you in the mix? Well, in addition to coming up with fun scavenger hunts, I connect easily with people. All kinds of people. It's important when you're managing teams. Yeah, uh... Okay, I'll put you on the list. Thanks, Jennifer. Wait. I also love this job. I love everything about the way we inspire people to connect with others and have fun. And I know that fun isn't a big metric in the corporate world, but you know what it's worth just by the titles you've given everyone. Wizard of this and lord of that. Because fun allows people to relax and be fully themselves which makes them productive and more engaged and that affects the bottom line. Look, I know that I'm from a small town and I know that some might consider that a disadvantage, but, you know what? Actually, that's just the opposite. Because I know the value of a tight-knit community. That feeling of being a part of something special no matter how big or small. Something personal, inspiring, fun. Good night, Jennifer. See, the tree looks good, right, Dad? Well, it looks great, Em. I put the star on myself. I wish I could see it in person. Me too. We got you presents. We're gonna ship 'em out this week. Aw, thanks, Em. I can't wait to open them. You ready for the next chapter of "A Christmas Carol"? Yes! "Merry Christmas, Bob." He is a good dad. He is. "On the back. I'm merrier." Just like our dad used to read to us. I talked to Dad today. He's been walking the halls of the hospital every day getting his strength back. I think he's really excited about coming back here in the new year. Yeah, of course he is. That's really good news. I wish we could've gotten all the repairs done around here before his return though. It'll work out, Shan. Maybe not by New Years but it'll- Mom! There's something wrong with the Wi-Fi. I'll check the router. I'll do it. I've done it before. No, stay, stay, stay. Just holler when it works again. Everyone remain calm. I'm gonna fix everything. I've got French fries, best in the city, French bulldogs, French language lessons. Though one doesn't really seem effective. Could romantic though. I got French bread, French pastry, French wine, French cheese. There is far too much eating in French. None of these are the one. Well, we could try it from the hen side. Chickens, poultry, clucking. Fried, breaded, fricasseed. What is fricasseed? I don't know. You're the cook. Baker. Very different. Also it's more eating. Maybe we're just hungry. I know I didn't eat breakfast. Oh, hello, Anne. Hey. We just got this great gift basket from our happy clients at the opera. Ah, I remember them. Yeah, artisanal Christmas cider from that new distillery up in Lincoln Square. Vogelhaus. Got cinnamon apple cider. Pear cider. Pear cider? Yeah, supposed to be delicious. And they make it there too. They actually just opened a new tasting room. What kinda bird would you say that is? Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Only if it involves partridges in pear trees. Well, Lincoln Square's in that old German neighborhood, right? That's exactly where it is. What are you guys talking about? Talking about an early lunch. Don't tell Alastair. It's really nice. Good atmosphere. Hi, can I help you? Hi. A colleague told us about your pear cider. We thought we'd come check it out. Yes, you are in luck. For Christmas, we offer it mulled with our signature spices. Let me give you a little sample. She does enjoy herself a good mulled spice. My sister and I, we actually make it ourselves. Our last name is Vogel which means bird in German. Bird. Partridge. What's that over there? Ah, that is our cider and brush class. It just started. Let's do it. What's that? Paint? Yeah. I don't paint. Well, me neither. That's actually a great date. For the 12 dates. You know, paint a canvas, have a nice glass of pear cider. You know, it's totally okay for beginners. You'll have so much fun. Come on. Well, I guess we're leaving. Do you mind if we... By all means. Thank you. So you being from Chicago, you must have family here. Your sister and your niece. Oh, my sister's here, yeah. Mother passed many years ago and my dad's been stationed overseas most of our life. My sister, Shannon, and I were army brats. Grew up all over the world. So how'd you wind up settling here? All of our best memories are in Chicago. The one thing that was consistent in our childhood was spending every Christmas at my Grandpa Jack's big old house on the South Side. He was a professor at Chicago University. So that was home. Oh, but that's not the house has- Falling apart, yep, that's the one. Shannon moved in after my grandfather died and the upkeep has been brutal. Hey, great work on your tree. Mine? Yeah, well, both of you. I think she meant yours. She did mean mine, she did. Who woulda known. I wasn't even paying attention. Well, that's the secret from now on. Okay. Hey, we should take a selfie. If we have pictures of all the locations, we can put it in the presentation for Wanda to help her visualize what our participants will do. Yeah. Okay and we should probably... get close, make it look an actual date. Sure, lean in, of course. Should probably get the art in here, huh? Oh, yeah. No, yours. Mine? Yours, yeah. My Picasso, hey, thank you. Oh wait, the partridge cider. Pear cider. Pear cider. What did I say? I don't know. Okay. Smile. Lunch? Yeah. Starving. So just up this block, there should be a bunch of places we can grab a quick bite. Thinkin' maybe steaks? What do you think, steaks? How you feelin'? Aidan. Dominique's Cafe, the home of- Chicago's famous coq au vin. Which is chicken. Which is hen. French hens. You're a genius. That is the greatest lunch I've ever had. That was really good. They offer cooking classes at both their locations. That's romantic. Learn to make coq au vin together. Coq au vin might be a bit complicated. What about a chicken leg to go? You wanna pitch Wanda a chicken leg to go? Three chicken legs then, three French legs. I hope everything is to your liking. Oh, it was delicious. We loved every bite. It was excellent, Dominique, thank you so much. Glad to hear it. Actually, we were just wondering about your cooking classes. Actually, they just started, but they haven't been as successful as I'd hoped. People are intimidated by French cooking like you have to be some sort of master chef. Well, we're creating a scavenger hunt which will take people to cultural and romantic places around the city and we would love to include your restaurant. It would be great promotion for you guys. Yes, that sounds interesting. Question, for your cooking classes, do you have anything a bit simpler than coq au vin? Something that a couple could make together on a date. Maybe a French Christmas cookie, something- Well, there's always La Buche de Noel. It's quick and doesn't have many ingredients. Oh wow. That's fun. Are we sure that's not harder than chicken? We can't overfill. If we do the buttercream squirts out the sides. Listen to your girlfriend. She knows what she's talking about. No, no, no, we- We're not uh- We just work together. We're colleagues. I like to cook so. Well, it shows. Bon. Ready to roll? It works better with two pairs of hands. Come on. It's the perfect experience for a couple. We have to show that. Mm-hm. Okay. So we just go? Yeah. Just roll it? Yes, have fun. Okay. All right, hold on. Go for it. Don't break it. Feel like I'm breaking it. It's okay. We cover it with icing. It's fine. Okay, not bad. Not bad at all. Bravo. There. Either that was quick or I'm very good at this. Hey, is it bad if the clues are around the corner from each other? We don't wanna bring people back to the same neighborhood. Dominique, where's your other location? Pine Street, Ukrainian Village. All right. Now we just have to turn French hens into a Buche de Noel clue. What rhymes with Noel? Cell, tell, bell. Bell could work. Smell. Does smell really good in here. It smells really, really good in here. They could take the I to where the swell hens dwell. Roll up their sleeves for a spell. And make a Buche de Noel. That's good. Well. I think we got it. Excellent. Thank you. Are we ready to taste? Yes. Oh, hold on, wait. Let's take a photo, right? A selfie. Yeah, okay. How do we do this? All right, well... Do I do this with... Can we just have her do it? Yeah, that's okay. Yeah, okay. Do you mind? Of course. No, I don't mind. Thank you so much. All right. Great. How do you say fromage in French? Fromage. There you go. One more. Sure. Excellent. Thank you so much. Let me see. Hey, Mr. Romano. Did you go for a hike? Okay, bye. What do you think? Looks pretty darn good for a Chicago cake. Ha. I thought you had to be at work all day. This was my work today. I will never understand your job. We're putting together a scavenger hunt. It'll take people all over the city. You should follow it on Saturday when we launch. See a little more of Chicago. Sounds like things are going well. Uh, Grandma, the things I ate today, the new parts of the city I saw. I think you'd really love it here. Like this guy I'm working with, Aidan. I thought he was one thing but he's actually something else. It's just different here. And Chicago is amazing but sometimes I just... I feel a little lost with people. You just follow your heart, kiddo. That is the only compass you will need. Thank you. Yes. Thanks. Big fundraising. Hey. Oh wow. Fun. Which one is he? That one. Like a top. Boom. Now we're both silly. You did not tell me he was so cute. It's, no, it's not like that. He's my coworker. It's not? Then why am I here at his niece's middle school trying to check him out? Because you're musical and this is a fundraiser for the music department. Jennifer, I write jingles for an ad agency. That's musical. So what, is he taken? No. He told me he didn't have a girlfriend. Lemme just get this straight. So you know how the other day you told me that you two had a great time eating and drinking and painting and baking and you've been getting along tremendously at work lately, and he went out of his way to tell you that he doesn't have a girlfriend? No, it- Yeah. No. No, you're taking this the wrong way. I think you No, you come with me, let's go. No, what? Come on. Also the electrician came by. He thinks it'll be about 10 grand. He also found wood rot, which is usually caused by plumbing problems. Lovely. Mm-hm. Excuse me, sir, how much is this wreath? What are you doing here? Just thought I'd come show my support. Thank you. I'm Carla. Hi, Carla. I'm here because I'm a big supporter of music and for no other reason whatsoever. Yep. Okay. Oh, I'm going to go and find musical inspiration among the children. Don't bother introduce me. Hi, I'm Shannon. Sorry, yes, of course. I'm Aidan's sister. I'm Jennifer, Aidan's coworker. Oh. Nice to meet you. Look, Mom. It's styrofoam pipe cleaner snowmen. Oh, nice score! Well, this must be the young artist herself. Yes, this is the tiny, talented Emma. Hi, Emma. I'm Jennifer. Hi. Do you like the wreaths? I do. They're beautiful. How much are they? They're $5. Sold. Wow. Thanks. Do you wanna come see my friend Riley's reindeer ornaments? I'd love to. He made 'em with real tools. Wow. Okay. Follow me. Have fun. Come on. So that's the new Bill. All right, stop. I'm gonna go raid the snack table while Emma upsells Jennifer. Okay, I'll be here doing all the fundraising. Yeah, you will. Enjoy yourself. Emma's uncle, right? That's right. I'd recognize Emma's designs anywhere. I'm her art teacher Miss Taylor. Miss Taylor, you've done an excellent job. Emma has been gluing and sticking things all over the house for a long time now. She told me about her house. Sounds like you guys have your hands full. She told you about the house? Yeah, a little bit. You know, your grandfather taught my older sister. She still talks about those Sunday dinners at Jack's place. Yeah, I remember those. What was your sister's name? Cori Taylor. She now runs a contracting business. Taylor Custom Remodeling. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Shannon. Yeah. Grandpa used to have those salons at his house with all his students, right? So... So, they were architecture majors. One runs a contracting business that I just found out and the others must be architects or designers or at least in construction and they all loved Grandpa and his hundred-year-old house. They might be able to help us out. I mean, it's worth a shot, right? I have a call into Grandpa's old student Cori Taylor. Hopefully she can connect us with some of her classmates. Yeah, thanks, Shannon. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Are you an ice skater? My Grandma Sue's farm has a pond. I couldn't wait till it froze up every year. I got good enough to do an axel. Oh, I would pay a lot of money to see that. 11 pipers piping? That couldn't be halfpipe bobsledding, could it and the five golden rings could be the Olympics and we'd be done. That's actually kinda brilliant but nothing to do with Chicago. Yeah, you're right. So what are we doing here? Well it's a Christmas market. There's inspiration on every corner. Do you hear that? Come with me. Thank you, very kind of you. Thank you. That was great. Thank you. We're in front of the church every afternoon. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thank you for that. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Thank you so much. Come on, I'll buy you a treat. Ooh, I like treats. This is for you. Ah, thank you very much. And this is for you. Thank you very much. That's for you. Thank you, Jennifer, very kind. The best hot cocoa I've found in the city. This is the best hot chocolate I've had in my life. Hey, there's a tree lot somewhere in this area, right? Wait, you don't have a tree? Your office is the North Pole. I've been working so hard. I haven't had the chance- Aidan! What? Where at? What, is it the church? The bell? Speak. A golden bell. That's not actually golden. It's steel and they painted it No, no, Aidan, what does the bell do at00? to protect it. Rings. Five rings, five golden rings. It's perfect. It's perfect. Yeah, but wait, what's the task? People just go and listen to the carolers? Where they could sing along, take a walk through the square, have a hot chocolate, take a selfie with the bell. It's a good date, right? That's a good date. I think we have our clue number five. We might have our number five. Oh. And we have a reprieve. Wanda's too tied up to meet with us today. She'll see us tomorrow. Wanda texted you again. Yeah. So we have the rest of the day and only 11 pipers piping left and that shouldn't be too hard. You wanna go back to the office, be in your own space? No, we're on a roll. And I got just the place. Come on. What? Yeah, this is it. Put it in park and let's go. You said you didn't have a tree. Yeah, but... And you were gonna go to a tree lot in the city. Really? An Iowa girl? Well, I didn't know about this place. What better place to get inspiration for our final clue? Come on! All right. So what size are we looking for? Well, it's for my apartment so not too tall. Okay, well how are these? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Well, find your tree. Well, I have to get a blue spruce, right? That one. That's the one? Yep. Positive? Mm-hm. All right, cut it down. Wait, I'm doing it? They don't have trees in Iowa? Well, sure but... Where I come from, if you don't cut down your own tree, you get a good old fashioned Illinois shaming. Well, we wouldn't want that, would we? I'm just messin' around. I can do it. No, no, you sit back. I got this. Hold my purse. Holding the purse. What was that? Notched a hinge at the base. Wouldn't want this old spruce to fall in your direction, now would we? Wow. Very nice, Iowa. Take it to go, Chicago. And one for you too 'cause that one shouldn't be left out. Mr. Romano? Well, hey, neighbor. Are you here buying a tree too? No, no, this is my tree farm. Oh, so Triple R is for- Robert and Rachel Romano. Rachel was my wife's name. She passed a year ago. That's when I moved into the apartment next to yours. You know, I was gonna stop by and thank you for that wreath you left. I think you probably knocked but I take my hearing aid out as soon as I get home. I don't really have anyone to talk with. That's okay, Mr. Romano. Robert. Aidan. Wait, so you two know each other? Yeah, my grandfather and I used to come here every year. I told you that. Oh. How do you two know each other? Well, Mr. Romano's my neighbor. Well, your lumberjack neighbor here cut down one of your best today. Well, that's good. How's business? Oh, busy as ever. Here. My cell number is on the card. Oh. If you ever need anything, you just gimme a call. Thank you. Merry Christmas, Jennifer, Aidan. Give your sister my best. Will do. Merry Christmas. What? You're different than I thought. You actually like people. Not everybody is who you think they are. That's a good thing. Hey, would you wanna decorate this tree with me? Well, it'd be me and my roommate, but... Will there be mulled cinnamon? No, but if you're polite, you might get egg nog with nutmeg. Nutmeg? No, that's even worse. Okay, so we do have a few more holes left and I can't believe I'm saying this, but is it possible that you do not have any more ornaments? Those are the spots for the most important ornaments. Ah. The Grandma Sue specials. What is a Grandma Sue special? Every year, my grandmother makes salt dough ornaments for each of her grandkids. Salt dough? What is that? They're all specially designed. And the only thing is you have to go pick them up from her house. Blackmail. Grandma Sue. She's crafty. And territorial. Think here's a spot. So I have to go to my Christmas party in an hour or so I have to get dressed. But it was really nice seeing you again, Aidan. Merry Christmas. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Yeah. See ya around. Thank you. That's for me? All right. Oh yeah. So take a look at our handiwork. What do you think? Ah, it's great. I think we make a pretty good team. Okay, let's put the skate right there. Oh, I've actually gotta run to go see Shannon and Emma. We're gonna go skating at the pier tonight. Great. Okay. Um, thank you for your help. Was wondering if you wanted to come. Oh. If you have plans, that's okay, you can- No, no, no, I can come. For inspiration, right? Right. You having fun? Yeah. Let me be free. So when we gonna see it? What? Oh, you know what. Rhymes with shmaxel. I got a pain in my baxel. Okay, you asked for it. Oh, let's see it. Look out, I'm coming for you. Oh. Get ready. She's gonna do something really cool. So you watchin'? Oh oh! Wow! How do you do that? Well, the first thing you need to learn is the bunny hop. Bunny hop? Can you lift your knee really high like this? There you go. First level achieved. Now let's try it with a hop. You got it. She's a sweetheart. Is she always looking out for everyone? Hm? Up. Oh! Oh! I'm good. She's down. Are you okay? She's all right. She's getting up. Hey. Yeah! You did it. You're great. You were so good. You're a great teacher. Oh thank you. We're gonna go get some hot chocolate. All right. Get outta here. Okay. You realize, you just fully just dethroned me as the funcle. I really did, didn't I? I am no longer the fun uncle. No. Are you proud of yourself? You wanna go get some hot chocolate? Yeah. Okay. I'll race ya. Bye. Oh. Gingerbread? Why, how are you making all of these cookies? I like baking for others. Hey, what if the 11th clue is doing something nice for someone else? The song is about gift giving. But what's a nice task for pipers piping? Bagpipes? I said nice not punishment. Well, you pipe icing on cookies. We could get them to make cookies. I know you like cookies but we already have the Buche de Noel. Is that not similar? Yeah. What if... they buy a piping hot coffee for a stranger in any of the historic districts that we list? I love it. Really? Yeah. Yeah, I guess it's pretty good. Are we finished? I mean, if you like it, yeah. I like it. Hey, we're gonna head out. Thank you again for teaching Emma how to do the bunny hop. Of course. Yeah. She's so excited. She can't wait to go tell Pop Pop. That rhymed. Good luck with him. Bye. Okay. Ready to go? Yeah. And I'll take your cookies. They're great. Yeah, they're the best. They liked you a lot too. So is Pop Pop your dad? Yes, Pop Pop is my dad. Where is he now? He is overseas in Germany recovering. He has hypertensive heart disease. He had a heart scare a couple months ago and had surgery. Oh. Is he okay? Yeah, yeah, he'll be fine. And they should be releasing him from the hospital just after New Years and retiring him. He has lived all over the world with the idea of being that eventually he would come back here and live with Emma and Shannon in Grandpa Jack's old house. The one with all the trouble? Yes, yes, that's the one. It's falling apart to be honest. I'm really sorry to hear that. Yeah, me too. Dad grew up in that house and my grandpa left it to me and Shannon because he knew that we would love and take care of it and I'm just trying to figure out how to do all that. Trying to give my dad his wish. Which reminds me, Jennifer, um... There's something I've been trying to figure out how to tell you. I also put in for the Head Game Creator promotion. Oh. Maybe I shoulda told you sooner. I just didn't want you to think that I presume that I would be getting the... I know how much the promotion means to you. And to be honest, at this point, I can't think of someone who deserves it more. Oh, thank you. That's very kind. I just, of course, you know, I wanted to... My dad coming back and the house being the way that it is, the raise for the promotion was kind of a solution for all of us. I hope that's okay. I hope you understand. Of course. You should fight for the job. I understand. But, hey, I should get you back. Our presentation's first thing. () Knock, knock. Hey, Anne. Just came to wish you luck. Thanks. I know you'll do great. Morning, morning. Morning. Hi. Hi. Okay, so break a leg, you guys. Thanks. I got you a coffee. Black, two sugar, right? Yeah, that's right. Look, Jennifer... Aidan, look, I... Uh... All right, can I? Yeah. Just wanna say how good it's been working with you. I just hope whatever happens doesn't get in the way of us doing that again. Course not. Good. All right, are you ready? Yeah. Let's do it. Okay, we are very excited to show you guys what we got. Jennifer. When the game goes live, it'll look like this on people's phones. The first ornament will open, bringing us to our very first clue. Wanda, if you would be so very kind. "'Tis the season when pears overrun, so head to the square of Illinois' favorite son. Lincoln Square. You can paint a Christmas scene in a bird house of red and green and sip a festive cider with someone you admire." Haus, not H-O-U-S-E. Vogelhaus in Lincoln Square? Yes! After solving the clue and completing the activity, players will upload a photo that looks something like this. Fun. And then they get sent the next clue. Which we already decided is the two turtle doves at the Chinese candy store. Right, I loved how the rhyme for hunker down leads you to Chinatown. Yeah, it's a good one. That one was all Jennifer. All right, next. Three French hens. "Head to Ukrainian Village where a heavenly smell leads you to a Christmas named street where famous French hens dwell. The class offered there has you bake for a spell as you finish your date full of Buche de Noel." Much be a French restaurant. A street with a Christmas name. Pine Street? What's on Pine Street that has famous hens? French chicken? Famous coq au vin. At Dominique's. Would you let the lady play the game? I love it. It's jun, interactive, cultural, Christmasy, with a strong social media component. You two have really knocked this one out of the park. Thanks. The CEO for the Devonshire Chain will be at the gala Saturday night. I'd love to introduce you both. Uh, yes! They will be there. I see potential for international tie-ins with this thing. She's gonna love it. All right. Next, we just need to nail down those specs for IT to upload the hunt. What do you think? Over lunch? Yeah, well, there's a new Greek place around the corner. Sounds good. I'll see you at your office in 15. Okay. Aidan. Yeah. So Wanda just left. Well done! She's very happy and that makes me very happy. Okay. Can you meet me upstairs in my office in 15 minutes? I wanna talk to you about that promotion. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah sure, um... Hey, sorry. Slight change of plans. I won't be able to make lunch. Alastair has asked to meet with me. Just you? Yeah. Did he say it was about the job? I, I don't know what to say. Uh, you don't have to say anything. You're great at what you do. You've been here longer and if Alastair chose you, it's because he knows you'll do a good job. I know you will too. Thank you, that's very nice to say. I uh... Maybe I shouldn't have told you. I just didn't want you to think we're meeting behind your back. I appreciate it really. How about I put together the material for IT? I'll send for your final approval. No, no, I can still do that, don't- It's fine, I got it. Congrats. Thanks. Aidan, come on in, please. So I wanted to- Before you say anything, um... I want you to know that Jennifer worked really hard on this account. Yeah, I know she did. To be honest, she came up with most of the clues. Really? Yeah. I mean obviously, we worked together and that was great but if you were to look at who did the heavy lifting, it was, it was without a doubt her. I'm really surprised to hear you say that, Aidan. Yeah, me too frankly. I don't mean to overstep but if it's between us for Head Game Creator, I think it should be her. Good, good. Then I made the right choice. What? I've decided to give the position to Jennifer. So then this meeting is... To find out if you'd be interested in Tony's old position Wizard of Operations. I mean you won't be creating games anymore but you'll have more involvement with growing the business, increasing efficiency. It does come with the same salary increase as Head Game Creator. It's just better suited for you. Did I not speak? Yes, the obvious answer is yes, it's perfect. Okay, great. I'll announce the promotions at the next staff meeting in January so can you please keep it to yourself till then? Yeah, of course, of course. Can I ask when you plan on telling Jennifer? I know it would mean a lot to her. Yeah, I'll tell her at the hotel party tomorrow night. Tomorrow. Yeah, after her big success. I thought it would be a nice moment for her. Sure you don't wanna just go tell her now? I mean, her office is very far but we can just psst. You and I. Totally yeah. Yeah, let's go. I mean 'cause your the boss, right? Okay. That's, that's, no, no, no that's me? That's you, yeah. Oh. You're the one. Yeah. Congratulations, Aidan. Thanks, buddy. I appreciate it. Okay. She went home for the day. She's doing the IT work from there but said you can call her if you need. Thanks, Anne. Yeah, I'll do that. Okay. Hello. Hi, is this Aidan Walsh. Yeah, that's me. This is Cori Taylor from Taylor Custom Remodeling. Thank you so much for getting back to me so soon. Your grandfather was the best teacher I ever had. Yeah. Yeah, he was the greatest. I'm glad you enjoyed his class. Would you be able to come to my office this afternoon? Today? Oh, this afternoon, yeah. Okay, I can do that. So did you take an Uber or did you take a Lyft? I just came by taxi. Hello, sweetheart. Grandma Sue? I just happened to be in the neighborhood. Oh. Oh. I don't understand. What are you doing here? Honey, last we spoke, it sounded to me like you could use some family right about now, in-person family. So I thought I would bring you this to hang on your tree. You brought my ornament to me? Don't look so surprised. It's a puzzle piece to reflect your work and your decisions. I just thought it would be fun for you. It's perfect. I love it. Well, I am just dying to try this big city kitchen of yours out. Egg nog shortbread? Pecan butter creams. You're on. Your granddad was a great mentor to me. He's the reason I got into construction. Really? And you said his house is falling apart? Is that how I put it? Yeah. And that place means a lot to me. I'd like to help you out if that's okay. Yes, yes, that is okay. Thank you. I'd be happy to devote resources from our offices. And I contract out for plumbing and electrical but Jim Edwards from West Electric, he was one of your granddad's students. I bet there are plenty more who would help out if they knew about it. Well, you think? What if we posted about it on our alumni website? If you're willing, I'm in. Oh, I just love this oven. Please tell me we get to eat some of these. And by some of these I mean all of these. She's always giving them away. As long as we leave some for Mr. Romano. That's what I mean. Who's that? Our neighbor. He's actually quite lovely once you get to know him. Here, take this one. Really? Matches your shirt. Mm. Mm, it's so good. You bet it is. Oh George, George. Oh, Mary, oh. Well, I have never been much of a city girl myself. I have a few acres in the country at my farm. You have a farm? And you live here? It's a Christmas tree farm. Jennifer. Did you know that Robert has a Christmas tree farm? Yeah, you're looking at one of his trees right now. Oh, that is a beauty. She cut it down herself. I just have to send off this last set of specs and I'll be all yours. Okay, sweetie. Oh, I love this part. Hi. Hi. Yeah, you can go and submit. I'm sure it's fine. If you feel good, just go for it. Thanks again for doing that. Yeah, okay, I will. Hey, did you still wanna monitor the hunt together when it goes live tomorrow? Actually, believe it or not, my grandmother came to town so I don't think I can. I'll have to do it remotely. Grandma Sue. That's exciting. You guys must be happy to see each other. Yeah. It was a big surprise. A big surprise. You're still planning on coming to the party tomorrow night, right? I mean, Grandma Sue's not whisking you away back to Iowa tomorrow, is she? No, of course I'll be there. Good night, Aidan. You need to try one of her cookies. Oh, you know, I don't think I could one- I don't think it's an option. Aidan Walsh. Yeah, this is Jack Walsh's grandson. What's that? Yes, I would love a plumber to come by and take a look. Tomorrow? Sure, yes, you just let me know what time works best. That sounds great. Thank you so much. We'll talk soon. All right. It's another one of Grandpa's students. He saw the alumni post. He wants to do the work pro bono. Are you serious? I am serious. Hold on. Aidan Walsh. Yes, I am Jack Walsh's grandson. The electrician can start on Monday. He says it'll take a week to get done. Which should take us to the 27th. Cori is gonna be here this afternoon with her crew to prep the walls. So plumbing can start Tuesday. Which should take us to the 31st which means we may actually be able to get all this done by the time Dad gets here. It's happening. Okay, look, I gotta run and track this scavenger hunt which went live four minutes ago. I wanna play. Can I play too? Mom? I can coordinate repairs if you take her. Run, before she changes her mind. Thank you. Good luck. Okay. You ready? All right, come here. Thank you. Make your face. Jenny. Look what I found. Isn't it just so cute? Oh I love it. Excuse me. I'm doing an online scavenger hunt. Could I buy you two a coffee and maybe take a selfie? Come on, let's get a coffee to go. We have a party to get to. Oh yeah, we gotta go. Excuse me, miss. Wow. Can I offer you an egg nog cocktail? With nutmeg? No nutmeg, some cinnamon. I saw you and Emma did the hunt. And you and Grandma Sue. Mm-hm. Believe we beat you. I think that's debatable. Ladies and gentlemen, if you're here, you've solved the last clue of our Christmas scavenger hunt. Please welcome, from Lincoln Junior High, 12 drummers drumming. All right. Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the new Devonshire. We're so glad to have you. When you woke up this morning, you had no idea you'd be at Chicago's greatest Christmas party, did you? Christmas is a time to reflect on things that matter most. And the Devonshire wants the people of Chicago to know you matter to us. We're not here only for out-of-town guests but for the residents and local businesses as well. And speaking of local businesses, we do not do this alone. Big City Quest organized our amazing scavenger hunt for us and I'd like to call out the two people who made it happen. Jennifer, Aidan. Please show yourselves around the hotel and enjoy your evening. Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas. Congratulations. You guys wanna go raid the candy bar? Okay, have fun. Congrats. Yeah, you too. We did it. I know. It's done. I can't believe it. Me neither. Okay, I'm gonna go have a chat with this handsome gentleman. I'll see you soon. Okay. So that was Aidan? Jennifer, look at you. Honey, just days ago you said you didn't know if you belonged here or if you would ever catch your dreams. Look how beautiful this all is. It is magical! Honey, I am so proud of you, no matter what you decide or where you feel you belong. Grandma, I wanted to tell you that I actually didn't- Ah, Jennifer. Congratulations. May I introduce my grandmother, Sue Holloway. This is Alastair Kelly, my boss. Nice to meet you. Pleasure's all mine. My granddaughter just loves working for your firm. It's given me a great excuse to get to know your city. And we love having her. In fact, do you mind if I steal her away from you? Oh, no, go ahead. Shall we? I mean, wow! What a whirlwind, huh? Amazing. This has been such a great week. Listen, I wanted to speak to you about the Head Game Creator job. Oh, it's fine. Aidan already told me. He did? I asked him not to. Oh, it's fine, honestly. He deserves it and he'll do a great job. What exactly did he tell you? That you were giving him the promotion. I did to Tony's old position. Tony's? So the Head Game Creator job is- It's yours if you still want it. Yes! I mean, yes, I want it! Great, well, we'll make the announcement in the new year so keep it under your hat till then. In the meantime, I need to find the Devonshire CEO. I have a feeling she's gonna keep us a lot busier in the new year. Congrats, Jennifer. Thank you. You deserve it. Oh, Aidan asked me to give this to you. Okay. "Where calling birds share our city view and the memory of mine is your best clue. Let's raise a glass and celebrate. If you would join me on the 13th... Date. You knew. Promised I wouldn't tell. Sneaky. Believe me, it was not easy. You happy? Very. I know I got a reputation of being a bit of a people person, but believe it or not I don't know quite what to say here so I'm just gonna say it. I like you a lot. I'm sorry if I didn't make that clear at times. I'm also sorry because I'm happy that Grandma Sue doesn't get to take you back to Iowa. I've had a lot of good Christmases, Jennifer. But this has been the best five days of Christmas I've ever had. Me too. Good. We made one French log cake, one very bad, bad painting, two hot chocolates, all those cookies you made that I ate, and something else that rhymes with partridge in a pear tree- Would you please just stop talking? Okay. Merry Christmas.
