Some boys found her. Did she leave a note? Good morning. Sorry. Sorry, uh, sorry, you gave me a fright. You're not Melanie. Oh, no, I'm her sister. Is she around? No, she died a few days ago. Oh, when's the funeral. Sorry, who are you? I got her a job. It's funny. She never mentioned she has a sister to me. It's funny, 'cause she never mentioned she had a job to me. I didn't catch your name. It's Lisa. You're looking for a job, Lisa? No, thank you. We'd best get going, then. Oh, don't worry yourself, telling us about the funeral. I'll find out. Melanie always wanted to see the world. She always wanted to experience life to the fullest. Sometimes that love of life was almost too much to bear. She tried to experience too much and too quickly, but now she's free to be all the things she ever wanted to be, to be the person she really wanted to be. I'm sorry Me... I'm sorry, Melanie. That we weren't able to be of help to you when you needed it most. That you felt there was no other place to turn to. But you're safe now. With your mom and dad. God bless you, Melanie. We won't forget you. Just wanna have a quick word with Lisa. Lisa, hi. Hi, Joe. How have you been? Will my answer wind up in front of the paper. If it's good it might. Seriously though. I'm sorry, Melanie was a good person. What happened to her, Joe? I mean, what was she involved in? Did you hear anything? I know you want answers, but there really aren't any to be found. I have to go, I'm sorry. Well, maybe I'll pop out the Herald one day and we can just talk about it. Just let it go. I am sorry. Okay. Are you sure you're up to this tonight? It's been five years, but I bet nothing's changed unless they've moved the mops. That's not what I mean. I know what you mean. I'm ready. We need to discuss where we're going to scatter the ashes. Well not in Newpoint. She wouldn't have wanted it. Hello. Where's Adrian? Didn't he work nights? He rang to see if I could cover. He forgot his girlfriend's birthday. Oh, he still does that. Yes, every year. Used to work here, didn't you? Yeah, I did. Lisa Hill Yeah, I was tour guide and now I'm a cleaner, how's that for career development. Museums need cleaners as much as tour guides. Well, I'm glad you feel that way because you're the man with the keys. So you're coming with me, I'm afraid. Aren't you going to make that, "You've missed a spot" joke everyone always makes? You ever missed a spot? Ah, there's nothing to miss. Everything's spotless. People have other things to do now. Like what? I don't know. Other things. It's a shame. What's it say on your name tag? Rich VDE? What's that stand for? Reichard van der Euer What is that, Dutch? Belgian. I nearly went to Brussels once. Everyone's nearly been to Brussels. Someone told me it was really nice. Really, uh, um... That's why I have Rich VDE on my badge. Saves people struggling to come up with anything to say about Belgium. Audrey Hepburn, Rene Magritte, Poirot, Jacques Brel, that guy that did Tintin, the ones that did the Eurovision Song Contest with that song, "Ding-a-Dong," Dr. Evil, Jean Claude va... What was that? It's probably the entrance sign. It's loose. You know, you don't sound very Belgian. What's a Belgian sound like? I don't know. Well, I grew up in a lot of different places. And you ended up here? This is too late to leave. I love this room. I wish I knew more about the people that own these things. Innit? Your history, it's good at recording dates of bustles and birthdays and all that stuff, but never really record any of the human things. Once they've gone its just hard to remember those personal touches. These people, they, they changed history. They did things. They were revolutionizing and being significant. Do you think everybody has to change the world then? Hmm, would be nice to have an effect on something. If we all invented something or started a war, no-one would ever get anything else done. Putting right what feels wrong for you, that's how to change the world. Than and getting a good night's sleep and five portions of fruit and veg a day. Well, scratch the other stuff, sleep and eating fruit and veg are all that is needed, just not at the same time. Was that a joke? I think you might just made a joke. I think I tried. It was my sister's funeral today. I'm sorry. She committed suicide. Some boys found her in the woods. I wonder if they saw him too. Saw who? Nothing. Wait a minute. Do you know something about it? What, someone, who should they have seen? Where Mel died? Rich, if you know something about it, just tell me, wait, Rich, Rich, wait a minute. If it's bout Mel, you really need to tell me. Rich? It's not funny, you know. Adrian. Lisa, why are you creeping around in the dark? We just got your text. "Running late, girlfriend's birthday, buying flowers, smiley face." I told you. I can't believe Rich just left. Who? The guy you swapped with. No Rich works here. Belgian, Van der Something? Van der Euer? He passed away. He died? Yeah, 'bout six months ago. He got knocked off his bike, nasty business. He's a nice guy, nice, weird, but nice. Lisa, hi. Can I check a story with you? Richa... Reichard van der Euer, it's Belgian. Drowned in the canal, crushed his bike and must have ended up in the water unconscious under Norris bridge. Six months ago. So what's this about really? I think it's about Mel. Have you seen the hospital report about the cause of death? Lisa, enough. You need to stop this. But what about the police report? And there's always an inquest, isn't there? I'm not going to have this conversation with you. I just want to know if there's anything suspicious. Suspicious? Last year your sister tried to kill herself with an overdose of antidepressants. Then last week, some kids on their bikes found her hanging from a tree. I heard from the doctors that there was so much heroin in her blood that they're amazed she wasn't dead before the rope went tight. Is that what you think is suspicious? Go home. Get some sleep. Forget about it. Maybe there's nothing to it. But you're journalist. How often do you get suicides that don't leave a note?? Hello! Adrian? Okay, what the hell is going on? I want to know why you faked your death. I didn't? But you're dead. This some big joke? You're dead. Really? What? Like a real life dead person? No, wait, just give me, give me a second. Wait there, wait there. I'm not dangerous, I can't even touch anything. Give me a minute, stop! I'm sorry if I upset you... I'm sorry. Do you believe me? There's no heartbeat. Rich, the other night you said you saw some guy... I saw someone in the woods. You want to know all about them, don't you? Just want to know what happened to my sister. I was walking, trying to work out how far I could get. Seems I can only go where I've been when I was alive. That's when I saw her, up there. And I looked over there and there was a man in a green blazer. What did he look like? Tall, I couldn't see his face. He watched her for about five minutes and walked off in that direction. So you can't move beyond this point? Okay. Lisa Hill. That's right. Sorry about your sister. I hear you found a hairband? And a microphone, a plastic clip-on one. I see, found at the scene? Not no, not really, about half mile away. I see. And, ah, why were you looking there? - Just a hunch. - Just a hunch? I see. Did you find any fingerprints? From the, uh, from the popular brand of hair band or from the little piece of plastic? It's a microphone. Either way, no, we didn't. And apparently there was a man in a green blazer seen nearby. Oh yes. Receptions said you were saying something about a man and a green blazer. We checked with the two boys who found your sister. They saw no-one. When did you arrive back in town, Ms. Hill? A couple of days ago. I see. So that would be after Melanie was found. Yeah, that's right. So who told you about this man? - Just someone I met. - Name? I, I can't remember. You can't remember. I see. I appreciate this is a difficult time for you, but there really is nothing untoward about what happened. Nothing untoward about suicide. I'm sorry, but this evidence, well, it's not evidence. It's guesswork. When you lose a loved one, people, they look to things that aren't there. Sometimes you see things you want to see. - Do you see? - I see. Yes. Hey, um, you're needed up on three. Okay, I'll be there in a minute. DCI Hendricks, he's heading the inquiry. Well, why am I not speaking to him then? Because it doesn't work that way. I tell him if we find anything suspicious, he looks into it. So far we've not found anything suspicious. If we do, I'll let you know. Oh, well they didn't even take me seriously. I couldn't even speak to the guy in charge. You didn't tell them about me, did you? The ghost witness? No, I did not, they'll lock me up. Do you want me to make shit? I think it's best to leave it to the professionals. Hang on, it sounds like you don't even care. Ooh, hang on! Don't you want to know why you ended up in the canal? Even if I did, it wouldn't change anything, I'd still be dead. Well, what about justice? What about justice? I'm still dead, and so is your sister. I'm sorry, but that's the truth. I thought you ghosts had unfinished businesses, and this, yours? What difference will it make? Don't you want to rest in peace? 'Cause I want Melanie to. Nice day. Been different. Seems to be keeping you busy. I've barely seen you. I'm sorry. I've just been trying to put some things right. Nothing to worry about. That sounds like something Melanie would say. I'm fine. That sounds like her too. So when you've put these things right, what next? I have no idea. You know, if you ever wanted to borrow some money to, I don't know, go to university or go traveling. I could always lend you some. I don't think this Island has much of a future for you. What about you? I can't leave you, not now. That's very kind, but I'm settled here. My friends are here, my life is here, yours isn't and we both know that. You say you're worried about upsetting me, but do you know what would upset me more than anything? Losing another niece to this Island. I'm going to turn in, but my offer still holds for as long as you want. Maybe you just need to get a good night's sleep, hey? Then perhaps in the morning, you'll think of something. Good night. Good night. Hi, Lisa. Hi Joe. It's not too late to call, is it? No, I've got a new-born daughter. She doesn't sleep. I don't sleep. Do you have any recent photos of Melanie? No, why? It's just, I haven't seen her in such a long time. I'm forgetting all those tiny details. What she looked like, what she sounded like, who she became. I just want to see her again. Yeah, me too. I can't help you, I'm afraid. Do you think she was in trouble, Joe? This is unhealthy. I know what you're doing. Just let it go. Do you know what? Everyone keeps saying that. I know she was in trouble and I can't sleep until I found out what happened. She was my sister. I owe that to her, Joe. Joanne's crying, I have to go. I'll call you tomorrow, okay? She wanted to make an appointment with me. I'm a drug rehabilitation counselor. She was asking my advice about getting clean. She had plans to leave the Island for a fresh start. I hear that a lot. She asked for my help. Help with what? I don't know. She left a message when I was out having dinner. I thought I'd phone her when I got back. Next thing I heard she'd taken her own life. Ignoring someone when they ask for help is not something I'm particularly proud of, especially in my job. It's okay. You couldn't have known. Would it be possible to listen to the message? I'd just really like to hear her voice again. So sorry. It's been deleted. All it said was that she needed help and it left a contact number. Did you keep the number? New Point racecourse. Oh hi, yeah. Can I have your address please? Oh! You work here? You boys got permission to be here? Does she? I'm not asking her. We're just looking for the exit. Do you want me to show you? Nah, I'm sure we'll manage. Off you go, then. There you go. Thank you. Biscuit? Looks like you needed that. Thanks. I saw your sister last week. The day before she, well.. She and Toby used to keep that in the admin office for a few days. Toby, who's that? Toby Matthews, her boyfriend. Yeah, well they asked me not to say anything, and turn a blind eye, which I did. I'll figure they're a young couple. They want their privacy, you know, it's all about the privacy, innit? So where's Toby now? Dunno, he hasn't shown for the last few days. It's a shame, really? He's a lovely lad. He, um, he left bag of his stuff here. I thought I might take it to a charity shop or something, so. I can take you if you want. I thought you'd say that. Are you okay? I saw some guys following you. What sort of ghost are you, not embarrassed? Not protective. Just wanted to make sure you're okay. I thought you weren't interested in being involved? Well I sort of changed me mind. Well, why have you sort of being changing your mind? I found a clue. Looks like dirty underwear to me. Sorry, force of habit. That's okay. Check out what I found. Clues, not fashion comments? All right. Look at this! It's Melanie's handwriting. Did she have a laptop? No. Are you okay? Lisa? No, I'm fine, I just fell on my chips. Oh, there's no numbers in the address book. But wait a minute, there's a video. Tony, you haven't given me what I need. We... Tony, you haven't given me what I need. We're out of... College is now closing, Miss. Tony, you haven't give me what I... It could be anyone. Don't be ridiculous, that'll take forever. Well, this is the wrong street anyways, so let's move on. I think I found it. What do you recon? Hello, I was wondering if this was you. It's natural, no chemicals. Keeps you healthy. I keep myself healthy. So what do you want? I'm looking for Toby Matthews. I haven't seen the little runt. So you know him then? Let me see some identification now. Now! You're Melanie's sister, aren't you? I liked her. I feel your loss. Thank you. Why are you looking for Toby? He was seeing my sister? I just wanted to ask him some questions. And you want my help? Why, are you willing to help me? I don't speak with people I don't know. You knew my sister... and Toby. Tony, you haven't given me what I need. We're out of... Tony, you haven't given me what I need. I don't allow cameras in here. It protects my clients and my business. What business? I make things. Some people need to vanish at short notice and sometimes documents need amending. Do you mean forging? I mean amending Are these all fake? They look amazing. I don't know where Toby is right now. He hasn't picked up what he's ordered and I'm very busy. What did he order? Identification for him and for your sister. Fake ID? Can I see it? I never finished Melanie's, she was supposed to get me some passport photos. They had arranged a rendezvous tomorrow at 5:00 AM, but I don't know where. They never told me. Jennifer said Toby's disappeared. So what are you going to do? Go back to the drawing board I suppose. I might try speaking to those boys that found Melanie. Before you do, can you get something for me? It's that one. You know what you're looking for? Yeah. Yes? Hello? I believe Reichard van der Euer is one of your tenants? Who? Rich VDE? Oh, the Belgian. Yeah, yeah. Who are you? You his girlfriend. No, I'm just a friend. I've come to pick up some of his personal belongings. The box you want is over in the far corner, I think. I didn't have a forwarding address in Belgium. So, so all his stuff came to me when he died. Yeah. I'll give you some privacy, I think. Thank you. Did you find the letter? Yeah. I also found this. My other work-pass. Where did you work? INCIN. It's an incinerator plant. What's in there? They destroy all sorts of paper, medical waste, everything. Anything suspicious? I don't know. I was never allowed past the front gate. That sounds pretty suspicious. Well, it was more health and safety. I was a temp. So you never saw anything unusual happen? Unusual things don't happen to temps. Most people didn't even know my name. You know, there's one time I had this guy shout at me. He must have thought I was someone else. Who shouted you? It just some guy, a visitor wanted to get past the gate. He insisted I let him inside before, he must have thought I was Carl or someone. I mean, the guy kept asking me whether... What? Let me see your sister's note again? Crabot, that's what he kept saying. What does it mean? I dunno, he started shouting it at me. I didn't know what he was on about. He then got angry and tried to offer me some money to let him pass. I said no, and he sped off in his car. Okay, well that sounds suspicious. I'm going to take a look to see what I can find, but I need your help getting me in. I know Carl. Good morning, can I help you? Hi there, I have a meeting inside. Okay. What's your name please? - My name. - They're all men. - Um... - Mr. Lloyd, Deloitte, Hopkins, uh, Nick Gibson. Nick Gibson. Nick Gibson? Yes, well, Nicola Gibson, but my friends would call me Nick for short. I see, Nick? Yes. Did the boss tell you I was coming today, Mr... - Mr. Hooper. - Mr. Hooper, did he tell you? He doesn't tell me much. Ugh, he's so bad for that, isn't he, Big H? Mister Hooper isn't in yet. And shouldn't really be wondering around alone. Oh, well, now don't worry, 'cause I know my way around. Well, I'm not sure... Carl, you can trust me. And that's a Nicola Gibson-guarantee. Just to confirm, large pepperoni pizza, with extra mushroom, side order of wedges. Morning, Mr. Hooper. - Morning, uh... - Carl. - Carl, yes. - Nick Gibson is waiting for you inside. Well thanks, he's early? He? I think we have an intruder. Can you get here as soon as you can? How can I calm down? You said you'd fix this! What happened? Didn't he tell you we have an intruder? Well what if they find something? This can't come back to me. Harding's on his way now. He said he'd be here soon. I'm going to my office now. There's no one here. The desk is how I left it. Check the printer. What? I said check the printer. Yes, the printer has been used. I've just arrived. The shipment seems fine. Crates just sitting here and waiting. I want them on board, now. It's not clear yet. Maybe she's been talking me to someone, I'll handle it. But these distractions though, they're your responsibility. You understand? The shipment goes ahead as planned. No, I'm going to Hooper's office now. See where he is mucking about. Ya, there's someone by the crate. Tell main gate she's running! Stop! Hey! Stop it, stop there! Well, that was a waste of time. Spreadsheets and telephone bills. Are you going to investigate the numbers? There's 20 pages of telephone numbers here. I'm going to have to call everybody up and be like, "Hello, are you involved in some suspicious activity that I don't even know exists and it may not even be real?" "Oh, you're not?" "Okay, thanks, bye." So what are you going to do? What can I do? Oh yeah, I forgot I had this. Could you post it for me? There's no address. I need you to write it for me. MNF. Mother and Father? They know you that you're... They do, don't worry. It's not my will or anything. Couple of years back, we had an argument and I said some things I couldn't take back. We stopped talking, and six years went by. I wrote that letter, to say I was sorry and wanted to see them again. I mean, I was going to send it, but well, this happened. And you know what? I can't even remember what the argument is about. Now I can't really even remember their faces anymore. Those tiny details. Stupid, really. No, not really. Oh, God, this was such a long time ago. Melanie was always filming something. Hey, you look lovely! Gaz. Rockstar. He joined a band and cheated on her with a groupie. Merry Christmas, everyone! I completely forgot she had blue streaks in her hair. You look ridiculous! Not now, put if off! Wait a minute, isn't that you? I didn't know you were at the pub? What were you going to say to me? Nothing. Didn't look like nothing. I can't remember. Yes, you can. I wanted to show you this room upstairs. I went up there by accident, looking for the gent's. There was a ceiling with angels painted on it, you know, sort of like 18th century, one of them looked like you. Really? Yeah. I think it was the nose, but then I sort of, it sounded a bit creepy. "Oh, hello, you don't know me, but how about coming and looking at the ceiling in the room upstairs?" I was trying to work out a way to tell you when, well, you saw the rest. You think I'm creepy, don't you? No. I'm just wondering what the angel looks like. Why don't you show me? Listen, maybe we should head back. Why, are you scared it's going to be haunted? Happened on the Islemore island... Can I order a black coffee, please? The worst accident in Newpoint that anyone can remember. The fire broke out several hours ago, fire services working hard but there's still no sign of extinguishing the blaze. Hello? Hi, how are you? I'm fine. Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm okay, thanks. Where have you been? I've been worried. Ya, I'm really sorry. I'm just, I'm just in the middle of something right now. That doesn't sound good. No, you don't need to worry. I'll be home soon in. Police are looking for this woman in connection with the incident and are appealing... to the public for any information they may have. The manager, Mr. Clark Hooper was found dead - from asphyxiation... - I'm gonna have to call you back. When emergency services arrived. ...point Infirmary by air ambulance but was pronounced dead on arrival. A sad day, for INCEN-staff staff and a tragedy that burns more deeply than the building behind me. Martin Taylor Garland Share Tonight, Newpoint. Destroy the evidence! What? INCEN's burned down, Hooper and security guard are dead, there's been a fire... We need to call the police! No, because there's pictures of me on the news, breaking in! Then we need to find more evidence then. When I was in there that all these crates and there was this there's this invoices that said there was defective pills and they were all signed off as destroyed. Defective pills? Yeah, look at this. They were making regular cash withdrawals from the company, large amounts. Rent or bills? No, that's cannot compare. Not a bad day's work. Yeah, but with no sign of where it went. Payola? That's just still no connection to Mel, though. It's just phone numbers, hundreds of phone numbers. It doesn't connect. Just rings out. Rings out. Doesn't connect. Hello? Oh, hello? Yeah, hi. I'm interested in talking to you about INCEN. Oh, they hung up. Yeah, no-one's talking. Just keep trying. You're through to Alpha-Med Pharmaceutical... Ah, no, answerphone. Please phone back between the hours. of 8:30 A.M. to %:30 P.M. Monday to Friday. It's ringing! I know. No, it's ringing here! Your bag! It's Mel's phone. She must have been working for them. Maybe she found out more than she should. We have to go! You know Crabot? He's Head of Police. C.R. Abbott? Crabot! - Somethings not right... - Where're we going? I need to keep phoning those numbers. Someone must know something. You are through to... We're not home, so please leave a... I need to get some concrete proof. What are you doing? No! Lisa! What... I killed a policeman. What did you find? It was sent to Africa. It had Harding on it. Mr. Harding Gray. You can't give up now. Lisa! How are you enjoying my old office? Harding Gray? You look like you're ready to give up? Such a shame, you're so close. No, no, no I'm not out there. Where are you? I'm about to disappear. I'd just like to say goodbye before I do. Selling defective drugs in third-world countries? If the police don't find you, the press will. Well, you gave Abbott quite a headache, but he's going to be fine. But he is now going to make you pay. You've assaulted a police officer, burnt down an incinerator plant, you won't get away with it. What happened to my sister? You think I'd tell you? For the evidence I found, you might. At Jennifer's. Documents linking you, Abbott, that boat, the Damfino, or Port Said in Africa? You haven't been covering your tracks that well, believe me, Documents? You have them on you? Show me. In person. Take the stairs to the basement in 10 minutes. If anything happens to me, copies will be sent to the press. You are brave. Your sister's dead. Is it worth it? Bring your evidence. And I'll tell you what you want to know about your sister. Otherwise I'll be gone and you'll never find out. Hm, seems we've woken too soon? Nice to meet you finally. I'm Harding Gray. Your sister's diary is quite a page-turner, isn't it? Shame no-one else is going to get the chance to read it. 16:13 Why aren't you wearing your green jacket? My friend saw you wearing it. No. Yes, you did. Why did you kill her? I don't take kindly to employees walking out on me, bad business. Your sister vanished, suddenly wanting to meet us here. You and Crabot? Abbott didn't understand my business. Didn't have my vision. He just took the money and looked away. It's my business. My business. And I sweated blood building from the ground up, and your sister she thought she could come along and ruin me, with a pink camcorder, hidden in her jacket, recording our conversations. One junkie employee with a crisis of conscience. Threatening to ruin my empire? She was clean. Hm, she was. All good pharmacists keep heroin for emergencies. Just one prick and a piece of rope to make the problem go away. No one cares! Don't you see, people start sticking their noses into my business I'll make them disappear. Like an accident. I even ran someone down in my car one time. Rich, you killed Rich! Or a suicide by hanging. For another eyewitness. Sticking your nose into my affairs. You're worse than your sister! It's my business! You're worse than your sister! Makes the hunt, begging for your life. Joe. How have you been? Why, are you going to tell Abbott? Abbott? He's being arrested. I found enough dirt on him to put him away for a very long time. Well I saw you two working together. You saw me trying to get to the bottom of things. The first rule of small town journalism, keep your friends close and a potential news story, even closer. Once again, I have you to thank for my illustrious career. If you hadn't encouraged me to start looking into it, if I hadn't followed your breadcrumbs, I never would've gotten this far. Glad I can help. You staying in Newpoint? No, think it's time I left. Your parents would have been proud of you, Lisa. Melanie too. Thanks, Joe. Your aunt just arrived.
