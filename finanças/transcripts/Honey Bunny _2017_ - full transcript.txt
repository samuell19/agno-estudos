- Show me your little one! - How is that "small"? - I'm sorry! Great! - Yeah, that sounds better. Give me a kiss! Push your wurst into my pretzel. I have enough Alsatian games... - You used to like them. - Think of something else. Maybe they are too limited. I have! Now it's gut, gut, I... I have an idea! I'll take you to Gulag! Oh yes, Vladimir! - Do you like Russian? - I prefer a Belgian mechanic. Oh, it's impossible! Daddy will change soon candles in mommy's two-stroke engine! - What? Daddy and mommy? - Well, how? - Where did they come from? - I missed it so much. Verbal slip as if. Wait. Only without such noises. You are imitating the squeal of tires! Do not do this! - I don't make any sounds! - You do. With mouth. No! Nonsense! Listen to. - Yeah. - I don't have hallucinations. This is a washing machine. Sometimes it does. To stop it, - you have to bang her sideways. - I don't do the laundry. Are you back? What is it? There was no party? What happened, bunny? Come on - You won't understand anyway. - We will understand. Tell. It will help you. Elina... Elina and I.... It's over. She dumped me. I will die! - No, you won't die. - Come on, it's just a girl. - You will also throw away many things. - I don't want to throw anything. - I only want to be with her! - We're with you, bunny. - It calmed him down when he was a baby. - I do not understand. It's easy. You loved her, she too, you still love her, she you not so, or maybe not at all... It was your first love. First. So there will be next. It's nothing important such a draft, such shit. Make you hot chocolate? Elina... she loved chocolate. She definitely loved to breathe too, but it does not mean, - that you have to stop. - I will stop. What happened? Did bunny have a bad dream? Was he hung up? Not now, Eloise. Go back to bed. Brush your teeth and sleep. Tomorrow will be better. Mommy's right. Good night, bunny. I can't say "mummy"? Well now. Don't worry, bunny. Even when all girls stop loving you, Mommy will love you forever. . We did it when you were little. YOU CAN'T DO IT TO ME! I die! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? REPLY! HONEY BUNNY Why? Your turn. I understand. Hi. . Finally! - We have a new fragrance from Jouvency. - Target group? Luxury cougars. You need to find the name and slogan. - There is also a bottle design competition. - Oh, fuck... - Stinks of a morgue. - How is that? - What is this shit? - Just shit. It's some kind of art. Maybe like a good wine, it must be left... It will be shitty work. - How's Vincent? Still down? - Yes. It vegetates like a plant. So what are we doing? You have to wait. He is a teenager. No. I am talking about this "something". You may need to feel how it smells on the skin. Maybe it won't be the same. Sure! But we are jerk-offs. You see... Son of a bitch. You were right. This is not the same. - It's even worse! - I smell of shit! - Enough already! Thanks. - Get out of my office. - I'm worried about him. - Me too. - He often cries. - Yes. Often. Can you measure the temperature like this? Yes. Yes you can. 38.2. You see? Nothing special. All you need is some paracetamol. For sure? It looks like something hurts him. I assure you not at all. Ah yes. Indeed. Small children, small problems... Tasty. Jeremie, after breaking up with the girl he lay on the couch for days. Ours too. Like sewn up. One day we will wash him with upholstery. - It's funny. - Great! - Thanks. - Don't laugh. This is one of the main reasons - of teenage suicide. - Fact. You think you know your own child and one day, suddenly... bam. - Bam... and what? - Well... bam. Vincent is sensitive but he would never do that. He has a steel mind. - Of course. - Let's hope so. What about you? Play! Wake up! There is so much violence here... Yeah. I'm with you. If this comforts you... Franck and Charlotte returned to each other. Seriously? How did they do it Franck went to the Alps with boys from Base Jumping. They filmed him as he jumped, shouting her name. - He put it on the net. She gave him a like. - And they came together? - I'm telling you. She gave him a like. It's typical for walking sticks. He throws you to check what craze you do for her The bigger the craze, the more fun. This is the basis. - I don't understand women. - Eleven o'clock. I'm flying. Mother will kill me. Wait. Are you leaving me too? - What should I do? - Well, I say... Tattoo her name on the forehead, go naked on the street, jump into the Seine. - Will I buy her a dog? - Yes, do something extreme. Extreme... Okay. You must keep an eye on him. Discreet observation up close. But don't let him go. Jeremie just then began to skip school. And smoke. - He came home unexpectedly. - We took him out. He repeated the class and left for rehab, but... - Now it's good. - Yes. - Not like Jules... - He ran away from home for a year and a half. Interpol found him in Belgium. His parents didn't recognize him. Not the same boy. He lost 10 kilos. Do you remember? He was very ugly. - He lost two teeth. - Maybe we can change the subject... Of course. I would breast feed him To comfort him. Elina... honey... Invalid bottle. It is the intoxication that counts. - They didn't want to scare us. - They wanted to help. - You know Paul. - That's it. - I'm listening? - Mrs. Pelletier? Yes, it's me. - Shit! - What? Missis! - You can't enter here. - I'm a doctor, don't get tired. - Rinsing the stomach? - We only took a sample. - And? - He's in the lab. - We've found that... - What? Where's Vincent? Where's my son Mom! - Bunny! - Everything okay... Why did you do that? What did you take? Sedatives? What else? Nothing... Nothing. Only perfume. Eloise called an ambulance. But I feel good. I didn't want to kill myself. I swear. I just wanted to smell her. And so somehow I came... - I swear it! - It's worse than we thought. I'm still looking after strangers and I don't see my son suffer! - Relax... - We're with you. Daddy is with you... Do not worry. - Don't worry, bunny. - No, well... "bunny"! - Mom, I'm big already. - But... For us you will always be a bunny! KISS ME We have to do something about it. I'll talk to Elina. - She'll be back on her knees! - Come on! What does she think? That sissy can't do it alone handle your business. What do you suggest? We have to get rid of Elina. It means? Looking at all this he will never forget her. I tell him to take it off. He won't do it. If we start sharply, it will close in on itself. We must be subtler. Manipulation is the key. I think you forgot about the skirt. Now better? Plant doesn't want to kill itself anymore? Plant goes to school? - Why are you taking a computer? - We must be credible. - Thieves wouldn't steal Elina's photo. - We're morons! Well... you have to take care of the salon! - What have you done? - Well... credibility! - But not the vase from my mother! - Quiet! Plunder! - You broke my mother's vase! - I didn't want to beat anything. - My cup! - We don't destroy anything! School championship 1988! You got that vase somewhere! You never put flowers in there! - Because you don't give me any! - You're allergic! - This paper provides us with maintenance. - Not just it. And your vase It has been stinging our eyes for 10 years! - What are you doing! Not Magma 71! - You never listen to it. People divorce for such reasons. Put down this diploma. - And you put that disc away. - You first. - No. You first. - You first. Together. - You're pissing me off. - same to you. - Until the evening! - Yes. - Maybe... - same to you! It is impossible! Impossible! I have read your message. How are you - Nothing happened to you? - Harold, come see! - I do not believe! In the XXI century! - They enter the house as if their home. Sorry to all of you! Hello, sorry! You don't think Is this a bit weird burglary? - They didn't even break the lock. - Yeah. It's my fault. He left... an open window in the bathroom. - Exactly! - They had to be stuntmen. And in addition very small. Third floor, narrow window... - Maybe they were... - Circus performers! - Yes! - Circus in town. - With midgets. - With dwarfs acrobats! Some stupid dwarfs. - They stole only from my room. - They took my cups too! - And they took the vase from grandma. - Oh no! - Yes. - What bastards! And why did they make my bed for me? - I'll call the police. - No! - We're worried about you. - When your dog dies, do not push it with straw. It won't help you. I can not understand... Everything was going fine we wanted to rent a flat, we were thinking about a child. You won't get it anyway. You can't erase two years of life. - He'll definitely come back to me. - No! When a woman wants something, - it doesn't matter if it's a purse, new shoes... - Spa weekend. Or the breakup, she fights for it to the end. Believe me. You didn't like her, did you? You are my son. You deserve better. I have something better somewhere. It's about her! Well. We know it too. It seems to us that she is the only one and then we meet better and then even better. Seriously? How do you know? You told us with my mother - that you were the first to each other. - This is not the same. - How is that? - help me. Keep talking. - I will listen to you. - Well. I met my mother when I was 15 years old. But later we had other adventures. When we met again we were experienced, more mature... - For example, this Italian was... - You had other women before mother? Not "before" but "after". - Alright. "Before". - At the same time. - Let's not get into it. - But we can come in. - No. - And why not? I wanted to say that I too, after Giovanna, I thought I would die. It seemed wonderful to me and in fact... Although... How she said my name! Haroldo, Haroldo! Well now. Understandable. Come to the point. Together with my mother we have developed plan for you. - What plan? - A plan to forget about Elina. We do it for you. You must want it. This is the basis. What should I do? Stage one: Elina is a whore. - What? - Repeat: Elina is a whore. - You must be kidding! - Fuck, slut, bitch, minx... - It is not so much the term that is important as... - Definition is important. Miserable my son she knocked him down! Nobody else but slut! Slut slut slut! Stop it, she's not a whore. Naming her like that won't change anything. You are idealizing her. This is one of the stages. - You need to take her off a pedestal. - Baseball bat over your knees! - It's a metaphor. - Elina is a whore. Repeat. - You can do it. - Yes. - Elina is a whore. - What? I didn't hear. Dad can't hear. Speak more clearly. - Slut. - Good, bunny. Further... - Slut. - You don't regret her. Well. - Slut. - Don't stop, it's good. - What a whore! - It's almost... Yeah slut! Fuck over the whore! - Okay, I don't want to know... - See? - Relief, no? - Please. Now eat it. We forgot about this photo. If you heal yourself you will throw this picture away. And now let it remind you what do you have to do - Forget about her. We will forget together. - About this whore. It went well, didn't it? We'll see. What are you doing? I'm learning. It is even interesting. That's vulgar. I like such vulgarity. A pig. Discontinue. Well... - Torn up! - No, it's on... I know. - Oh, there it is. - What is it? I do not know. And this? "I would like to be your tear, to be born in your eyes, - live on your cheek... - and die on your lips. " - It's old-fashioned. - Yes, but sweet. Beginnings of love, butterflies in the stomach... - Do you remember? - I don't remember writing you - such kitsch bullshit. - Read you your letters? We were smarter. Especially me. So what again? - My son! What happened to you - I hit a school door. - Why did you tell me to come? - To "stop and think", - as the saying goes in the industry. - What? "Stop and think". Don't make fools, stop. And think about it. - Is this a Nobel prize winner? - You are 18 and I am your father. It's time for me to teach you a few important things about life. Advertising is an art of lies. We sell shit but the customer has the impression that he buys gold. With a marriage and it's the same with love. That is why we pretend a little bit all the time. - Not at all. - Yes. I will show you. - What again? - Experience. Quietly. Love starts with an explosion. We stop seeing reality. Our vision is distorted. Love takes control over our body, over our heart we feel like in a fairy tale! But love is like a roller coaster. There is a rise, and then, without warning... Love is a game in which he reigns law of the stronger. And you are not always stronger! Simpleton! That's why you have to have a hard ass! You wore glasses of love and unwittingly you lived in a lie. You are now opening your eyes. And you see she is wearing shoes, size 45, and in the morning her breath smells. Now you see reality. Dad, you must have been good to work but... - But? - But... That you would be at this age... and not understand what love is? It's a little scary. We feel sorry. You know what? Elina is like this smell. It is difficult to get rid of it. You have to scrub. Stop it! What are you doing? It smells! It is Elina that smells so bad. Tonight in the shower, use a gel. - And rub strongly. Goodbye, Elina! - Stop it! - And how did it go? - Perfect. Cool. I'm happy. - It was strong. Very. - But how did it really go? - You were right. It won't be easy. - Leave the rest to the professional. I'd love to. Good luck, professional. You think you are suffering. I see suffering every day. Real suffering is here. Good morning. Why are you here? I have hemorrhoids removed. It seems harmless but it hurts a lot. - It's nothing serious... - If you feel pain, you'll see! - This is just pain in the ass! - Really? Courage. Chlamidophylia pneumoniae. It won't come out so easily. Do you smell the morgue? - I smell so bad. - No! Do you see this man? He has necrotizing fasciitis. The bacterium rolls all his internal organs. It looks good on the outside but in two days he will go to the cold store. What are you talking about? I had a birthmark removed. Of course: hallucinations, memory loss, hallucinations. Who are you And what does it smell like? Please don't worry everything will be fine. Good day! - Was it a small slip-up, Mr. Janvier? - No! - No! Not her! - Here basically... Benign tumor. Only he is dying, no necessity to cut it. Minx! - Don't you feel funny now? - This is not the same! Same. It's like breaking your arm. Two weeks in a cast and after the case. Think of you from room 112. In 24 hours his brain will flow out of his ears. You're exaggerating a bit, no? HOW ARE YOU, PROFESSIONAL? Of course. - Three to zero. Changing the server. - Vincent! Play. - And tell me what you liked about her. - Everything. Her smell, her smile... The way she bit her lip when she was touched. And when you kissed, a rainbow appeared above you? - And rose petals fell on you? - You're weird. 15:0! - He's right, you're weird. - You don't know what love is. And your romantic weekends? The first was in Strasbourg. There I understood that it was the only one. You went with pate to the land of sauerkraut? Very funny. I will beat you. Is everything okay? - Are you lost? - Excuse me. 30:0. We can do something together without these love dramas? - And why should I play too? - I remind you that we have begotten you - among other things to play doubles. - It is true. - Okay. Well, I don't play anymore. - Eloise! We have begotten you not only because! She lost her sense of humor. I'll tell you, why it wasn't the only one. She did you a lot of bad things. Made you feel guilty she just wanted to be with you all the time! She cut you off from your friends. Do you remember the scene she made Lest you go to Antoine's birthday? How do you know that I listened a little bit how did you talk on the phone. - What? - You never tell us anything. - We're trying to get involved. - Are you listening in on our conversations? Relax, not yours. - And her laugh! It was impossible. - It was worst during sex. - Sorry, but the walls are quite thin. - Oh no! Damn! Why don't you spy on me? No, wait... - It's her laugh, not her, you know... - Her laugh is very sensual. No, it was like that... - Is that supposed to be sensual? - Don't you know I'm pregnant? You think I'll let go because you don't like her laugh? With the caretaker, Mr. Lopez. Your emotional state distorts everything. We had an affair in a trash can. You said that Strasbourg was brilliant. And the Grand Canyon? So so... We'll call our son Jason Kevin. - I love double names. - Look at the world through the eyes. - And not the balls. - Or I'll commit suicide... Pick up the balls, daughter. - Crack is shit. - Casino is shit. - Cocaine is shit. - Sex is shit. - Alcohol is shit. - Hash is shit. Candy Crush is shit. - Talk, bunny. - Elina is shit... - My case is different... - Yes, of course. Everyone says so at the beginning. - It's normal. - You are in the repression phase. - No. Let's go from here. - You know what? We will help him. Let's touch each other. Let's take our hands. We will say it together. It's shit! - Again. - It's shit! Elina is... - shit. - And now. YOU ARE NO FRIENDS WITH ELINA. - You think that... - No! Why? Nice gravels of you. It wasn't easy, but I found it what are you looking for When my friends found her, she was emaciated. Motherfuckers left her in the woods. I'm sorry lady. They dragged her for four kilometers. It's all right now. Even an abandoned dog can do it. And regain form. A beautiful lesson. - Are we going? - Where to? It's hot. Excuse me! I don't see the relationship! - It's for your own good. - Elina! Take him! Take him! Take him, Elina! Massacre him! He has a strong jaw! It's great! She won the fights. What do you want? My balls! I owe you balls! - Let go! - Let go, who? - Let go, Elina! - I can't hear you. - Let go, Elina! - Well! - Cute. - Elina! Come back! End! - I'll be sterile. - Come back! - I don't want to stay with one testicle! - Let him go! - And what? - Easy to predict. - What is it? - Wait... What is this? Elina, honey... Invalid bottle. It is the intoxication that counts. Ah yes, bottom... He planned it. It is not the end. - Elina, honey! - What will he do? - This 360 flip is for you. - What is this? Skate acrobatics. He lied to us that it was a school door. - He hit himself. - I'm bleeding! Brilliantly! Bleeding! - Elina, I love you. - He won't do it. It blew him away! Where's the bread? Spicy! FOR YOU, LOVE! - Elina! I love you! - It's not funny anymore. - Completely crazy! - Look! No handgrip! Madman! - Profile picture! - Click on enter history. - I don't think that's necessary. - There are interesting things. Click. Oh no! - Stop it, it's normal. Biology. - Biology? Canceling. Come on! - I think I vomit. - Not a word to your brother! - Are you leaving? - We're leaving. Everybody. To Strasbourg. Draining off key stages. To do this, you have to go back there and mark your positions. We will not mean anything. - I'm better now. - We're not asking you for your opinion. - Are you coming with us? - I don't want to ruin his life. I prefer to do my own thing. I don't have to do everything with you. - I need some independence. - You are not independent. - You live here... - We don't do it for ourselves. It's the "family spirit". Your brother is a human wreck. - I'm here! - Maybe one day you have to do it the same for you when you are thrown away like an old sock. - I'm still here. - Get ready. Relax, brother. You will eat some cabbage. Further! Remember your quarrels. Stick them together and play such a movie. - We never argued. - You must have argued. Couples sometimes argue, without realizing it. - Seriously? - Yes. It is good if they later agree in bed. It's an animal reflex. Voltage discharge. Often... you know. - Stop it! - Have you used wacek often? You know how much it is will I spend some time on psychoanalysis? - I need figures. - I do not know. What shall I tell you? Normally. Three or four times. - Weekly? - No. Daily. In the beginning, when we knew each other poorly. Later we dared so we loved each other more often. It was just like I said. You've been arguing all the time and you didn't even know it. So now tell us what was so unusual about it? What did you do here We talked here for hours... about who we are, what we love. And there we had sex. Yeah. Nothing special. Here we told each other That we never felt anything like that, That we will spend the rest of our lives together. And we made love... here. And there too. They give here a map of places good to have sex? - Are you lost? - It's part of the program. In a place related to Elina, you will get in the face. - A proven method. - Where? In Guantanamo? - Let's go for chocolate and strudel. - Do you know how it hurts? Together here... Wait! Yes also. And here These. - Ah yes. - I didn't think about her! - I've never been here! - Preventively. Stop it's hurting! - What are you doing? - Nothing. Sure, send her text messages! He will despise you even more. - I'll help you. - Give it back! Dad! What are you doing? STRASBOURG WITHOUT YOU, IS LIKE A ROSE WITHOUT FLAKES. - You sent it? You are ugly! - You were to cut yourself off! You piss me off! You said, It's the best cabbage you've ever eaten. - I'm not hungry. - See, bunny... Elina's idealized image it's just like this cabbage. You thought it was delicious and it's not that tasty. It is not so tasty at all! - Fact. It's hideous. - Let's not compare Elina to cabbage. To be honest Elina wasn't pretty either. - I'm listening? - She has different - characteristic features. - What? Well... this one... For example, teeth. What was wrong with her teeth? She had a very horse jaw. And smile like a race winner. And a slight squint. - It was coquetry. - The coquette was good! Look. Memory portrait. - Don't forget mustache. - Yes! It had such a mohair can. - Okay, stop it. - You saw her through the love filter. - And we - as it is. - What she is really like. Look in the eye. You know what? You are annoying. I have to forget about Elina, and you talk about her all day. - In addition, you make fun of her. - We're kidding. No matter how many times and in what positions we made love. It is important that... I felt strong when I hugged her. When she looked at me I felt beautiful it made me happy. And now I should forget about it? I have to forget the most beautiful moments in life? You're pissing me off! - We're not exaggerating? - No why. - We're putting him on a good trauma. - We open his eyes, and it hurts. - We discourage him from everything. - She is playing with him. You saw it yourself. She snapped her fingers and he was already crawling. I am serious. - It's about our son's life. - For now, death does not threaten him. There is no point in talking to you. You have the answer to everything. - What did bite you? - I want to talk honestly, and you treat everything so lightly. Still jokes, still these jokes. Will you give me a massage? Excuse me. It's the cabbage. Or maybe... will we watch porn? Vincent is right You understand nothing. PARIS WITHOUT YOU... Thanks, dad. Thanks dad! You are a genius! Okay... Who is this? I MISS YOU ¥. Oh shit! Thanks, dad! Elina, I love you! Oh shit! Room-service? Champagne, please. Clea! I have to tell you something. I'm a jerk. You're right. I do not understand. We'll start again. We'll oil Vincent, we'll take care of ourselves! I organized everything. Harold... And what is this accent? Giovanna, I thought I was going to die! She seemed so wonderful to me! The first love is shit! You got that vase somewhere! You never put flowers in there. Sometimes couples quarrel unconsciously. I didn't write you kitschy bullshit. People divorce for such reasons. We'll have fun like the first of the day honey. I wonder, shouldn't we change something? - You too? - Yes. We are running out of ideas. He doesn't sleep anymore! I don't know what to do. I don't know either. Oh, that's a nice smell. They explained what went wrong at the first batch? Some ingredient broke down. Even at the best base A nice smell may suddenly come off. And we stand in place... The mathematician has a facebook account. - My father has her in friends. - And what? I logged in with him and I looked at her photos... Are you listening to me Hi! That's a nice pig! - Are you listening to me? - A mathematician is a scoundrel... I don't care. What is going on? - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - It's okay. And with you? Somehow it goes... Excuse me. Hello? I can't talk. I'm with... - My name is Elina. - What are you doing with her? I'll call you later. Excuse me. What did you say - Nothing. - Yeah... ELINA IS BACK! Excuse me. - Should I go? - No. Lets go. Of course. All effort for nothing. I did not delete your messages. I said that to piss you off. Nice. My parents kicked out all our souvenirs. - Seriously? - Yes. - They got into a fighting mood. - They hate me. From where! They saw me despair so they got a little hit. I had to think about it. I wanted to be sure. I have it now. I missed you. I follow you - not at all. Nice coquette! All good? - You look strange. - Yes... I would like us to they returned to each other. Simpleton! Yes, me too, but... She's got a jawbone... And smile like a race winner! Vincent? In the morning her breath smells... I think we have to... tame, get used to. Lets talk. Maybe it's not that simple. I understand. I have no talent for talking. - I wrote a song for you. - Cool... This is how it goes: So many days have passed My heart sleeps without you I want to turn this road today Somewhere deep in my soul Roses of tears were born And I have to apologize to you today Vincent, I love you I know that it will work now Vincent, I love you I want to come back Vincent, I love you I'm going back from the wrong path Vincent, I love you Hear me out She wants to rob you again You have known how much you have suffered And she is just playing Oh fuck... Don't listen to her because you will die soon This is a very bad woman And I'm lying to achieve the goal Vincent, don't believe her! And don't turn back this path Vincent, don't believe her! It's all a bluff Wait. It is not necessary... - I didn't think that... - It's unnecessary, because... I love you, Elina. I love you. Although the words of your song they are moron. I love you because... I missed you. Oh fuck how I missed you! Because it pissed me off That you dumped me. And I don't give a fuck... yes I do not care... of your squint somewhere and your horse teeth and your stinking breath. - What is this? - Flowers. - Where from? - From the florist. I wanted flowers. Part. Hello everyone! Kisses! Ah, these teens! But crazy weather! what! Make you toasts? I think he overdid it with drugs yesterday. - You have nothing to tell us? - About what? About Elina. You interacted with her. - Did you tell her what you think about her? - Yes! And even more! I looked into her eyes and I said: Elina, first, change your name. And secondly: our parting that's the best thing what could have happened to me. And boom! I'm glad she's gone from my life. You! You are hearing? That's the end. I don't want to see you anymore! Ugly! Pate! And now! And finished! In the trash! What is? I am happy as never before. Michael, that's it! Be good. Come on a vaccine. - No! - watch out! I count to 10. One... Two... - Three... - No! Michael! Be careful! Four... Five... It will end badly. Nine... And ten! Please leave me with him. We'll talk calmly. Okay, doctor. Are you Zorro? I'm Sergeant Garcia. The red spot it's a post-vaccination reaction. Will pass quickly. Right, baby? Goodbye. Hi! You have nothing to tell me? - Hi. - Hi. But I am talking about Elina. I see ghosts? or her twin gives you artificial respiration lessons? Vincent! I know what you will say. That it's not what you think... That's right! It's exactly what you think. But you tried so hard That I would forget about her... I didn't want to upset you. I love her. She loves me too. It's stronger than us. We just wanted to help you. Yes I know. And I'm sorry. I know that those in love behave stupidly. But that's also what love is about. That she is somewhere, what it looks like. You and dad went through it too. Yes. You don't look stupid at all. - Really? - Not at all. So you are not angry? I would be angry because my son is happy? I would be a very bad mother. My bunny My big bunny. I don't know how to hug you. You're so big already. Thanks mum. - Forgive me. - Stop it. Everything is alright. It's okay, mother. I don't want to push you but we're a bit stuck - with this perfume. - I know. - What are you doing here? - Your son - and Elina returned to each other. - What? Why did you want so much to break their relationship? The association? It was flirt. You invented the plan. Plan... I'm ashamed. - We gave him a good lesson of love. - You know we were afraid... That he will be happy? They spent two beautiful years together. That's a lot. What does that mean? That everything is doomed? That everything has an expiration date? We're struggling to save him, he falls again and you support him. Of course! You could also dream with him. Let him land in Belgium? Stoned, homeless? No! That he would feel alive. He lived life! Let him not regret! - What are you looking at? - For nothing. Think about how many beautiful years we had? Answer me. How many? - You can't answer. - Clea! - Don't bring everything to us. - Why not? We also just flirted at first. And what? Are we out of it? That's why you tell your son now That it would end badly for him? - What's the matter with you? - I do not know. I'm lost. I need... a break. - What? - I need to understand what's going on. - I need time. No words to children. - Moment... I need to know why we are still together. Why are we annoying why we are so bored. Yes. We are bored! You are also bored. Why are we not telling each other? silly things? Why am I not a tear which runs down from your forehead down to sneakers? Because we are not fifteen! No. I think it's because That we don't love each other anymore. Okay... I will sleep in the office today. One two three... You didn't hang up! Yes... well... I first. Give me a kiss. The other one. Yes of that. I love you so. I can't hang up. This is nothing difficult. There is only one button! Fuck! I was thinking about what you told me. I calculated my fifteen-year debt. 112 876 euros. - It will take a while, but I'll pay it back. - What debt? This is important. You're right, independence has its price. Only four euros for a meal? You think we've here a kitchen for the poor? You know how much costs a square meter in Paris? Because you only counted your room. And what about using the living room, the kitchen, the toilet? - Don't be a scumbag! - No, daughter. If you want to pay back, pay back. I don't like making presents. - That's what I thought. - Eloise! Have you added our love? How will you measure it? How do you pay it back? You know how we love you. I love you, daughter. I love you very much. Yes. It's okay, dad. Me too. What's happening? Where's mum? - She's left. - I didn't see her leave. - She didn't come back. - Where from? I do not understand. From the bakery. - I went for a baguette. - For a baguette, in slippers? - Yes. - Where is it? - Who? What? - Baguette. I left it somewhere. And children? Don't they guess? No. She sleeps in the office, comes back every morning. The kids are not stupid. - They feel everything. - You better tell them? - Smile! - I'll fall! - What is this comedy? - There is no comedy. We wanted to spend nice afternoon with the children. Spit it out. We are adults. Carousel, cotton candy... Where's the bitter pill? There is no pill. We wanted to celebrate Elina's return. It's nice that you treat it that way. By the way, I wanted to say... Elina and I decided... to find a flat. - I will move out. - Me too. - What? - What are these ideas? Moment. Mom and I want to take a break. - Give yourself time to think. - That `s nothing. This is life. - We still love you the same. - A break? Seriously? - Say you are getting divorced! - Take it easy. It's just a break. - You have somebody, right? - Where from! Do I look like an unfaithful wife? It can't be Dad. - Why not me? - Why not him? Nobody is there. Besides, it's not your business. - Is it not related to Elina and me? - No. But if this whore didn't go away... I'm sorry. That's not what I wanted to say, bunny. The bunny is gone. - How is it not? - Where are you going? - Where are you going? - To the orphanage. Let a real family adopt me. - Well done. - Take it. You have. Wait! I can't believe this is happening. With us, damn it! I thought parents have it arranged in their heads. Don't joke. They have a brothel in their heads. But they are old, so it is pathetic. - Yes. - why? This is some hell. I'll go crazy as it goes on. Let's do something. You have to teach them a lesson. - Seriously? - When I think how they tortured you... Well. You're right. - Now we will develop the program. - What? They think they don't love each other anymore? Well, we'll show them how much. Until they feel like it. I have! - I found it. - It's a good fact. - Nice one? Fucking great! - Stop it. Come on? - Why are you looking at me like that? - I do not know. You look weird. - Why did we come here? - You won't rot in the office. You changed the style so you are counting on changes in your life. - This is not the stage yet. - You made a decision - be consistent. You have two options. Option A: you are a cougar. You are bonding with a 25-year-old playing with friends on the console. Or option B: you don't change the category, and you're bound to a 40-year-old who is arguing over the phone with his ex. I can't watch him today! This is your week! Mathis, come down! Get off the couch. You will have to adjust the furniture. There is a third option. - One night stands. - I'm for it! You do what you want, you don't get involved you don't lose your illusions. You are calm, independent... and lonely. Eloise! Do you want to kill yourself? Drink a glass of this liquid. My friend's mother drank. It works. Okay. For something completely different. Together with Elina, we are celebrating a new month. We'll make a party at home. You don't have to go to the hotel because we invite you too. Cool, yeah? Are you happy no? Yes! Excuse me. Elina's parents will also be here. You will not be the only old man. Dad! Listen... You helped me. I will help you too. You stopped and you think but it gives you nothing. Move up! That's enough? - Are you lost? - It's part of the plan. You don't have much choice so shoot yourself in the head or shoot a cane but you have to shoot. She dumped you. Do you recognize her? It wasn't easy, but I found it. - The rest is up to you. - Are you crazy? I will never do this to your mother. He makes balls of you and you have remorse? What is? Did I say something wrong? Giovanna... Next Please. It's me. Excellent. Come in. - I'm listening to you. - My groin hurts. It's been difficult since the morning. I will check your insurance. Of course. Thank you. Well. Please undress. Of course. Already? Well... You're quick. The upper body would've been enough. But what. I'm coming now. Please lie down. - I may have a little cold hands. - You're welcome. Where does it hurt you? - Here? - Lower. - Here? - Even lower. Even lower? - Even lower. - Here? - Yes. - I can hurt you below. You're doing it when you take your hands off. - I beg you pardon? - I live opposite. - I've been watching you for some time. - So what? Please keep investigating. What do you think It is a Thai massage? Please get dressed. Tomorrow at 21.00. Venus Garden. - What Venus Garden? - It's an invitation to dinner. Are you inviting me to dinner? Just like that? Yes. No... Actually, everything is possible. Precisely. It's a little inflammation of the... pain. See you tomorrow. And so? - Clever of her. - You're talking about my mother. - Didn't you sit too long? - You know me. Yes. Is that him? - How's Giovanna? - I didn't find her. - But I have someone better. - What? You will see. Patience! - There's yesterday's pizza in the oven! - Cool! I will succeed! Giovanna! Haroldo! You haven't changed! Unbelievable! You also haven't... You can see that it's you. Do you pick up general or specialists? I do not really understand... It was such an art. I am a general practitioner. That's why I'm asking you if you pick up general or specialists. Art. Add some wine to me. Be right back. I have not forgotten about our flirt. It's like a bubble of champagne in my emotional wasteland. - You and the wasteland? No... - But yes. For five years I have had no affair. - For five years? - And you? Do you have a wife and children? I have a wife, very much even. And children. Lots of children. I have a beautiful life. You definitely have problems in your marriage. Otherwise you wouldn't call. Or not? - I'm sorry, I'll go wash my hands. - Say hello to my old friend. Friend? Ah yes. - What an inflatable doll! - What a stupid fool. Say hello to an old friend. An old friend. Help! - How are you? - Great. - What happened? - Nothing. - We're leaving soon? - I haven't eaten any appetizers yet. - They're not tasty. - I'll try it though. OK, try. Thank you. Tell about yourself. Where do you work? - In the advertisment. - And you? I? You know... - As before. - Are you still a model? Yes. But now they are only posing my hair. And I took care of the lines so much! - What are you doing? - I create... an intimate mood. You are so sweet. Champagne is cooled in the office. In the office? - Did I say something wrong? - No, where from! I have something between my teeth. - Did he tell you that? - Who? Madness! We will do something funny. Lust increases appetite, no? Yes! Let's go. We're leaving here. Enough of it. Let's go. Thank you, it was nice. Watch your fingers! Come on... - Because there... - Yes, Haroldo! You can't do this to me! I have to. She is on the hospital board! I will lose my job and return to Cleveland. She has no right! Yes, it does. It was sorry to look. He was sad. - He didn't even want to massage. - Take it easy. All is well. If you need to I also imitate the Norwegian accent. "I'm Bjorgfrid and I live in Oslo". - Great, but it's probably enough. - We'll go now. Thank you. Thanks. I also know fluent Japanese! Bravo! But thanks. Watch out, it's my father's computer! - How are you? - Nice. Run out of Guacamole? - Good evening! - All the best! Are you having fun? What a party! - Vincent, where's the vase? - In the trash bin. This is my father, Harold. Pierre-Ange. It's nice to meet you. - Hi. - Champagne? Oriane, nice to meet you. Someone probably called? It's nice that you came. If you talked a little more... Are you drunk? Dad! We love Elina. But when she dumped Vincent, we were very sad. Hi! What a party! Clea, Vincent's mother. - And I - Elina's dad. - You didn't say you invited your mother. I don't want discrimination here. I invite you and her. - Traitor. - Will we dance, honey? Let's love each other. - A little champagne? - I'd love to. - Champagne is over. Sorry. - That's nothing. I was preparing for the long evening. I came with spare bottle. - Why not with a student? - I hesitated. But I found That your seal will be too tight for us. Your husband said how happy you are that Vincent and Elina came together. Yes. It opened our eyes. An interesting hairstyle. Your idea Very cute. Original. Sometimes you have to dare. - She already did it. - I use it because I have hair. Yet. And you? Have you patented the style of a cloche? My style and I have you somewhere. Do you know what you need? Shower. - Forgive me. Small disgrace. - We understand. We'll go now, honey. Excuse me. We will leave you with your disagreements. Say goodbye to us, children. It gets hot in the kitchen, look! - Cool! - Do not worry. You are taking a break! You play a cougar! You weren't alone either in the restaurant. - Giovanna doesn't count. - Giovanna! I do not believe. At the first opportunity you are calling your ex! - I'm sentimental. - Right. Gorilla with amnesia, like everyone else. What I was wearing first date? It does not make sense! Such details mean nothing. - You took your clothes off quickly. - I'm not surprised at all. - I love you more. - What are you talking about? I have not forgotten anything!
