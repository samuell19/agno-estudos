I love you. I love you, too. - Good night. - Night. So, when are we going to see each other? I'll update you. Don't you miss me? I'll call you tomorrow. So you don't miss me? So? - Love? - Yes? Why are you still up? I'm still checking on the deliveries. What deliveries? For the restaurant. We have items for delivery tomorrow. I thought you already settled it. I encountered some problems. Love? Yes? Just stay there, okay? Yeah... Here, love. Thank you. That's a lot of effort. Just a few adjustments left. But you're at it everyday. Because I want my wedding gown to be perfect. I hope you don't feel exhausted. - Love? - Yes? Aren't you going to our family reunion? It's always busy at the restaurant. I need to be hands-on. Besides, your family never liked me. That's not true, love. They're asking me if you're coming. Love, we're getting married soon. We'll be one happy family. And they'll have no choice but to be nice to you. Unless... You want to postpone it? What? Maybe you can't stand me anymore. Love. Love, listen to me. I will never get tired of you. I don't want to hear that again, okay? Love, I know I have a lot of shortcomings, and you have needs that I cannot fulfill. Enough of that. Love, we're okay. I love you. - Bye, Love. - See you in a few days. - Love you! - Love you! Bye! Hi, babe. April? What are you doing here? I just want to see you. Surprised? How'd you find my address? Of course I know your address. Why? Don't you want to see me? What happened to you? I got caught up in the rain. Do you want to change? Sure. This is gorgeous. Who owns this? One of Nikki's clients. I see. If I get married, I want this kind of wedding gown. Oh, sorry. I'm still soaked. Can I use your shower? April. April... - Why? - Not here. Don't you love me anymore? Hi, love. How are you? I'm good, love. How about you? We just had dinner courtesy of my dad. Was it good? Honestly, no. I miss your cooking. Have you eaten? Not yet. I'm about to cook right now. Okay, love. What are you going to cook? It's already late. Please take care of yourself. Yes, I will. Love, why are you shirtless? It's hot in here. Love, is it okay if I call you back? I can't cook and talk to you at the same time. Sure, love. Go ahead. Or we can talk while I'm cooking. I’ll just put the phone here. Okay. Love, I miss you. Miss you too. April? Surprised? Obviously. You look terrified. Let's go. Where? Come on. Get up. I'll drive you home. Don't you want to have dinner first? Let's eat outside. When is Nikki coming home? On Monday. So you're alone for two days? Are you tired? - Good morning. - April... Don't move. - Don't move. - Where's my cellphone? Aren't you forgetting something? What? It's my birthday today. Happy birthday. How could you forget my birthday? Come on. Tell me. - Where's my cellphone? - I told you don't forget it! Hi, love. I'm here at the office. Okay. Anyway, how's Dad? Not yet. Yes, love. Love you. Bye. What happened? - Sorry. I broke a plate. - I'll clean it up. - No, let me clean it up. - You might cut yourself. Babe... Can I just stay here while Nikki is away? April, I'll just visit you at your place. Let me stay. It's my birthday. Please, babe. I'll leave before Nikki comes home. I'll behave after this. I promise. And besides... I have a surprise for you tonight. Wow. Surprise. Take a seat. How did you prepare all of these? Secret. Try the steak. It's good. Where's my birthday gift? Oh, yeah. Happy birthday. Why? Nothing. It's gorgeous. I have a plan. Let's travel. Even just for three days. Where? In Batanes. Why Batanes? It's my dream destination. I saw some photos and it looks like a different world. Going there will make me forget all my problems. It will happen. I am manifesting it. Seriously? Of course. Manifesting works. I have a question... But you need to be honest... If you tell the truth, I will remove my hand... But if you lie, I won't remove it. Game? Remember when I told you that I'll wait for you? Yes. Are you getting sick of me? No. Do I make you happy? Yes. Am I really waiting for something? Yes. Are you happy with Nikki? Babe. You have the right to be happy. Choosing yourself is not selfish. I love you, Miguel. I love you, April. I cannot afford to lose you, Miguel. I love you so much. I will wait until you choose me. I will never leave your side no matter what. Look at me. Look me in the eyes. I love you so much. I will never leave you. I hope you do the same. Good morning. Really? So you're going back later? How about Faye? Are you going to eat here? Babe? Babe, are you okay? Yes. Nikki will be home early. Okay. Let me drive you home. It's okay. You don't have to. Babe... Babe... - Babe... - Okay. Bye. Babe, next time, just wait for my call. You cannot just show up here. Hi, love! Surprise! - Did you miss me? - Of course. I missed you. - I'll get your wheelchair. - Okay. Thank you. Slowly. Sorry, my trip was cut short. Yeah. Thank you. Isn't it gorgeous? I made this for myself. I will wear this on my wedding day. Isn't that bad luck? What do you mean? For the groom to see the bride's wedding dress? They say that if that happens, the wedding will not push through. I don't believe that. Oh, love. This is April. April, this is Miguel. My fiance. Hi, Miguel. She lost her dog, Whitey. Do you remember what happened to our dog, Lola? Yes. She lost her dog in our area. That's why I told her I understand how she feels. It's hard when you're so used to him being there, and then suddenly, he disappeared. Here. Did you see her dog? Oh, sorry. That was my ex-boyfriend. I crossed out his face because he's a liar. I haven't seen any dog in our area. Anyway, we'll let you know if we see your dog. Can I get your number? Sure. 0917... 616-1341... 1341... April. Don't give up, April. You will find him soon. I hope so. It's so hard to get cheated on, and then lose your dog. I'll go ahead now. Thank you, Nikki. Let me walk you out. No, it's okay. Just let me keep the photo. Okay, sorry. Thank you. Take care. What's bothering you, love? Nothing. Just thinking about the restaurant. Don't be pressured with dad. Okay, love. I'll go ahead. Love you. I love you. April. Babe! What's your problem? Why? Don't act dumb. Why did you go to my place and talk to Nikki? Because you're not answering my calls. Even my text messages. - I have no idea where you are. - What do you want? Tell me! I want a place in your life. Is that what you really want? I know you're not happy with Nikki. I know that you can't leave her because you feel sorry for her. But you have the right to be happy, Miguel! Let's leave and go somewhere else. Didn't you tell me you only wanted a small eatery? A simple life. You don't need her family's wealth. I know— I love Nikki. Stop it, April! Stop it! I will never leave Nikki! Please don't leave me, Miguel. April... April... April, we're done. Miguel! You can't do this to me! You'll see! What? You'll barge into our house, and mess with us again? Do that, and you're dead! Are you okay, love? Who’s that? Nobody was answering. A wrong caller, I guess. - So what if there's an age difference... - Whatever. I'm so hungry. I ordered pizza an hour ago. - Anyways, I have to- - Hey, wait. Love? My love. What are you doing here? Watching the moon. There's a supermoon tonight. Look! Isn't it beautiful? Love... I don't know if I say it enough, but, thank you. For what? For always taking care of me. Love... Of course. Love. Wake up, it’s 2 PM. You've been lying here all day. You want to go outside? It's so dark here. Let me open the curtains. The subscriber cannot be reached. Please try again later. Everyone, please give way. Let us pass through. Get out of the way! - Excuse us. - Sir, what happened? Someone committed suicide. Who? The lady who occupies the corner unit. What's her name, Sir? April. April Esteves. Do you know the victim, Sir? Chief, it looks like he knows the victim. Do you know the victim, Sir? Wait... How are you related? Sir, can you come with us? Sir! Sir! Love... Love... Love? Love? Love! Love! Love! Love? Love? Love? Love? Love? Love? - There's a demon, love. - No, it's just a nightmare. Love, it's just a bad dream. Love... Love? Love, the demon's over there. Love... Hey. What are you doing here? I'm Miguel. April's friend. Yes. I know you. What are you doing here? My condolences. Trying to be the good guy, huh? Do you know why there are chicks on top of April's casket? No. Because every peck that the chick makes... is a knock on her killer's conscience. But I thought she killed herself? Do you really believe in that? I will go ahead. My condolences. Hey. I know what you did, Miguel! Find me. Liar! - Liar! - April! You're the one who killed me! - April! - You! You killed me! You! Love, you're having a nightmare. Hush. I'm just here. It's okay. What did you dream about? The demon? I'm just here. It’s okay. Love? Love? Where is the wedding gown? You're an asshole! Clara? I know you killed April. You killed my sister. Clara, I did not kill her. You killed my sister. I know what happened between the two of you. You think I didn't know you were sleeping with my sister? Clara, she took her own life. You were scared that Nikki would discover the truth, that's why you killed my sister. - You're in denial about April's death. - Liar! Asshole! You just used my sister and when you got tired of her, you just threw her away! I did hurt April, but I did not kill her. I wonder what Nikki would do, if she finds out. - Please spare Nikki. - Nikki! - Don't drag Nikki into this mess. - Nikki! Let me go! She needs to know the truth. This wouldn't have happened, if you weren't a cheater. Spare Nikki. She has nothing to do with this. Go away. Are you going to kill me as well? Love? Don't mind her, love. Go back inside. You need to know the truth. Love, don't listen to her. - Just go back inside. - This asshole has been cheating on you! - Love... - He had an affair with my sister. - No! Shut up! - When he found out that— He killed my sister! Love, is that true? Love... Love, you know me well. You know that I will never do that. Right? Get inside. Please explain it to me because I'm confused. What? She's just blackmailing me because she was laid off from the restaurant. Fuck you! Liar! - Miss, he's a liar. Trust me. - What's your name? Clara. Clara... If Miguel is at fault, I apologize for what Miguel did to you. But I know him. He's not capable of killing someone. He won't hurt me. You don't know this asshole! Please don't be so naive! Please. Just go home. We have nothing to talk about. You'll pay for what you have done, Miguel. Screw you, Miguel! I'm sorry, love. I didn't mean to drag you into this. Love? Love? Love? Love? Love? Love. Love? Love? Love? Love? Love? Love, enough! Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love? Love? Love? Love. Love. Love. Don't move. Don't get up. Love? Should we go to the hospital? Maybe next time. We need to know what is happening to you. I can finally walk. Let me enjoy it. I'm happy. Can I just have my moment? It's not a dream, is it? This is really happening, right? I can't believe it. I manifested to the universe that soon, I'll be able to walk again. What did you say? Manifest? Manifest to the universe, babe. It's true. Are you sure you're fine? Of course. I'm perfectly fine. I have something for you over here. Surprise! Love, what's this? Dinner. Steak and wine. Isn’t steak your favorite? Taste it. Does it taste good? I realized it's been a while since we last traveled. Let's go to Batanes! Batanes? Didn't we talk about it before? Let's go and leave everything behind. Let's forget all our problems. Love. I have a question. You need to be honest. Do you love me? Of course, I love you. Babe! Love... What's going on with you? You're not your usual self. Love, something bad is happening. It all started when April killed herself. Love, I need to tell you something. April and I had an affair. Everything that her sister told you was true. But I ended it because I don't want to ruin our relationship. April took her own life and suddenly, all of these are happening. Love, I'm sorry. Love. - Love. - Hush. Love. Love, do you still love me? Yes. So much. I don't intend to— Then we don't have to talk about it right now. Okay? Screw you! Why? Are you tired of me? Don't you love me anymore? No, love. Listen to me. You're being possessed by April. Liar! Cheater! I knew that you were cheating on me! I know everything! You made me believe that it's me! You promised me that you were going to choose me! I put up with all your bullshit because you made me feel that I deserve it. Right from the start, Miguel. I knew that you will just use me! Is it because I am crippled? Because you're taking care of me? You don't love me! Love, please, don't... Love, please! Miguel! Miguel! Miguel! Open the door! Miguel! Miguel! Miguel! Miguel! Babe... Why? Does it look good on me? You know, the first time I saw it, I told myself... Oh, this is perfect for me. Right? Babe, don't be afraid of me. I'm not mad at you. Remember when you went to my place and told me that you don't love me anymore? I knew that it was not true. Because I knew that you love me... and I felt that everything you said was true. April? Babe! Leave Nikki out of this! She has nothing to do with this. You just felt sorry for Nikki. You just feel guilty for hurting her. Don't worry. Nikki is still here. She is still here. Nikki is still here. It's me, love. It's Nikki. You don't need to choose. You can love us both. - That's what you want, right? - Stop it, April. Nikki is the only one I love. She's my only love. You love her? Do you love Nikki? Even if she wants to kill you? She wanted to do this for a long time. She never had the guts to do it. But now she does! Please... Love! Love, please. Go away. I know you've always wanted to leave. That's not true, love. You think I have no idea about your affair with April? I knew it all along. Long before you brought her into our house. She's here, Miguel. She's now inside of me. Stop it! I killed April! Do you want that? Love. Love. Love. I love you. I love you so much. I will take you to the hospital. Okay?
