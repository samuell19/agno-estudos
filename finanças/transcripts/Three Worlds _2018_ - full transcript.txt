- Well, I can tell you a funny story. I was in, uh, I was with some family friends and we were doing one of those obstacle courses that you like go on and you have to harness yourself to everything and they were older than me, so they, um, they wanted to go on the black course, so I was just like, okay, I'm gonna hold my own, and it was like a three-hour thing and we're like, holding on for dear life like on logs and going zip-lining into nets and like this whole crazy thing, and, finally, we're getting to the last stretch where you just have to zip-line into a net and then, like, harness yourself on and then slowly go down, so I went, landed perfectly, um, and there I harnessed myself a little bit, then I, I go down and then I un-harness myself so that I can just, you know, walk down, and all of a sudden I see my friend, he was a big guy, come zip-lining into the net and I'm still in the net, and so he crashes, I go flying in the air, land flat on my face in the gravel. Oh, it was just so funny now, but at the time, it was really painful. - Who are you? - I'm a person. - That's all? - I don't know. I was born in London. Who are you? - It's my turn to ask questions. - Fine, so what's the question? - The question is who are you? - It's a dumb question. - Okay. Do you think you're attractive? - Yes. - Are you smart? - Yes. - Are you sexual? - Yes. - Are you scared of dying? - I'm not sure. - What's your favorite color? - Yellow? - Why was who are you such a dumb question? - Because it doesn't mean anything. Who am I? I'm Ashley, I'm a frog, I was born in London, so what? - Okay. - You're weird. - And so are you. - Yeah. - Saam, you need to start taking your meds. - I don't wanna do drugs. I mean, I feel like I'm already on drugs, what's the point? - I mean, listen, what can I say? You know, I'm not a proponent of taking drugs for the sake of themselves. I just feel like in conjunction with what we're trying to do here, it would really work. I think you're being stubborn, and that your ego is putting up all these walls. Let me put it this way, if you keep repeating the same behaviors that got you into this, how do you expect to have any progress? - You're gonna quote Einstein now? - Einstein didn't say that. Actually Einstein said, how can we solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them? - It's the same shit. It's exactly the same meaning. All right, okay, I'm being an asshole, all right. I don't, um, I don't feel like myself. I don't feel comfortable these days. I have a hard time breathing. I keep thinking about breathing when I sleep. I mean, how long have we been doing this? - Therapy? My friend, we're not doing therapy. We are listening to our expression, and I think it's important to not get hung up on time. - Get hung up on time, money is coming out of my pocket into your pocket, all right, there's a transaction here. Would you be here for me for free? - If it was something that was absolutely necessary, yes, I would. Okay, you know what? I, uh, I gotta get going because I have a three o'clock. You know, I didn't talk about this, but I think that this might help you. I don't know, just read it and see what you think. - I wanna have five kids. - Who's the lucky guy? 'Cause that's not gonna be me. Are you mad? If I spin this and it goes to you, it means you're mad, okay? If it goes to me, it means that I can certainly draw better than you. - You cheated somehow. - I've been having way too many pills. - Really? - People have stopped bending towards me. And then so they get thrown out. - Come here. - Stop. - Come here! - No, stop, ow, you're hurting me! - I'm not, what? - Yeah you are, you're pinching my back. - Oh my god. - Oh my gosh! - Come here. - Stop, Saam! - Come here. - Stop, seriously, I'm trying to watch. Okay? - Take the fucking job, man. - Why am I getting the same bullshit gigs over and over again with you? - 'Cause that's what it is. - Mm-hm. - All this shit's just to roll the dice, man! Nobody's more talented than anybody else. I live in fucking reality! - What's reality, Tom? - Listen, Saam, I'm not going to get into some psychological debate on the nature of reality. I want what you want. I wanna fuck. I want money. I wanna eat goddamn sushi whenever I want. This isn't about Fukushima or ISIS, saving the whales, goddamn two-state solution. I wanna eat pussy whenever I want. You think that's vulgar or that I don't have morals? Nah, man, that's life, that's reality. - Bravo, that's what you think I want? - It is what you want, you just don't know it yet. - You're an asshole, Tom, I got in with the wrong partner. You are the wrong person for me. - See, that's what you think, that's what you tell yourself. Look where you're at, this is Holly-fucking-wood, bro! You think they built that on some Godard bullshit? Some Kurosawa fuckery? Mm-mm, look, this is you, this is it, this is you getting over it. This is you, this is you, this is you getting over you. - I can kick your head in, all right? Always keep that in the back of your fucking mind, all right? - Yeah, yeah, no, I know, you're real buff, man. God, I hate this shit, took a fucking bullshit meeting like this, fucking ad company dick sucks, fucking client, fucking talent! Let me tell ya, had to do this over again, I'd go into tech, design apps, make real fucking money. - What is this, some reverse psychology? - Stop being a baby and take the job, the money, this isn't gonna last forever, man, small windows close real quick. Take the job, Saam. - I'll think about it. - I beg you. - I'll think about it, all right? I have to go. - So, a week from today. - Take a nice swim, ah, Jesus Christ. - Always a pleasure, Saam! Take the fucking job! - Quiet on the set! Quiet please! Sound speed. - Opening up. You can hear that a lot. - There a signal? - Yeah, still going. - Ready now? - Yes. Okay, action. - Guys. Stand one, pull it back for her. - Yup, all right, we got something at least. - Yeah, let's get her, let's get her feet. Just like walking shots. - Let me just get focus. Tuck all the way in, tuck all the way in! Action! - Shit. - Hi, is Danica home? Hello. - Saam, this is Zorana. Zorana, this is Saam. - Nice to meet you, Zorana. - Sorry. - No, it's okay. You, uh, just paying tribute, having some fun? - What do you mean? - I don't mean anything. It was nice meeting you. - Yes. - She's only here for a month or so. - Isn't she gonna mess with your business? - No, it won't be any trouble. You want? - She seems nice, though. Same business? - Happy Birthday, To Me! - And all my friends, I got And it's a good time to be here. And everybody wins. - I would really get into watching like pro-wrestling. That was my shit. Saturday comes around, I'm waking up seven o'clock sharp. I got my Saturday morning cartoons on. I got my punch, my lemonade. I'm chilling. And then 12 o'clock my freakin' wrestling show would come in and once Soul Train goes on that means then Saturday morning is finished. First of all, wrestling was a really bad influence. Let me just get that out of the way. It was, um, 'cause, 'cause, 'cause, me and my brother would really like try and do that stuff. We would, actually, like I'm not kidding. I remember one time my brother freakin' power-dropped me in the freakin' marble floor. We made home videos of us wrestling. And, looking back at it now, it could have been worse than how it ended. Actually, we were lucky that nothing happened because like a lot of that stuff we were doing, we were really doing. Like, but since I was really young, you know, like I was really punching them or whatever, but it wasn't really hurting them that much because the people I was wrestling with were like freakin' 10 years older than me. You know, I was like freakin' 10. They were like 16, 17. I was freakin' wrestling with high school kids, okay. Let's be honest here. And a lot it, we would script out the punches. We'd make the punches look fake on purpose 'cause we wanted to make it look like a real professional wrestling match. We'd like to slam, jump off the bed, and my brother would really like double knee-drop me. It was like a freakin' psycho. I didn't know what the freak was going on. Like he would really jump off the freakin' bed and he would come down on me with both knees and he wouldn't even block, he wouldn't do anything. He would just, knees. And then we're putting it on film. I remember my brother and my dad saw that. He saw that stuff, dude. And I was still like the same age, like at the same time, not like recently, but like at that time. He actually saw that tape and I just remember him yelling at my brother, like in Farsi too. Like every single bad word you could imagine. He would just be, and my brother and my mom would be like, is no big deal, they're just playing. They're just playing. And then my brother and my dad would like rewind the tape. He'd be like, is this playing? Is this playing? He's freakin', he's slamming his head against the ground. Is that playing? But, no, my dad was upset. Like he was pissed. First of all, he was mad that we did it. Then he was more mad that we showed him it. So, we showed him it. We were like, dad, look what we did! You think WWF is cool, check this out. We put in the tape, freakin' dad was like wigging out. He was like, are you guys crazy? You could break his neck. He's like, but now, now that I'm older, now, I'm looking at it now, I'm thinking about it now, at this age, and I'm thinking, damn, he was freakin' right. What the freak were we doing? Like that was just high-risk. And there was no springboard mat. Like we were doing it all on the floor and, yeah, that was pretty bad. Basically, it all started when we started videotaping us wrestling. That's where it all started, to do our own home movies 'cause we were old enough to actually take control of the camera because my dad had like this big camera with a VCR camera. It was like over the head. You had to like put it over your shoulder to hold it steady. So, we were old enough to handle it at this point. I was like 10. I was also into horror movies. And so, my brother actually came up with the idea to let's make our own little fun movie and watch it and have a good laugh. And so, we did, we're like let's do one about Halloween. But, at this time, like how we're gonna do Halloween? We don't have Michael Myers' masks. We had to go with the supplies we had. So, we're like, well, what about Friday the 13th? I have a mask for that. Oh yeah, that's the thing! The funny thing is we were making a movie, Friday the 13th, and they had me playing the role of Jason. Like a short, four-foot guy who's like a 10-year-old kid. But the thing is, though, we kinda, we were thinking outside of the box. This was Jason in the beginning. Like, you know, when he got drowned as a kid? So, this was supposed to be like the young Jason, I guess because we also made a sequel which we ended up losing that tape. But that's when Jason got bigger or whatever. So, anyway, so I was playing the Jason. He put a little shirt over my head to make it look like I'm bald because you know Jason didn't have hair or whatever. It's like all skin. So they had to put the mask on me and made me do this Jason thing. It was like my brother was directing the whole thing. He was like you're gonna be laying here. Oh, I even conducted the music! I was on the piano and started to play like some dark intro thing for this movie and we just kind of did it like ourselves and my brother was like narrating it. He was like Jason and Irvine. It was like what the freakin', Jason takes over Irvine. 'Cause, at the time, there was a movie called Jason takes Manhattan came out. So, we kinda parodied that. At the time, we weren't thinking it was a parody. But now, looking back at it, it was a parody. You know, Jason takes Manhattan. Jason terrorizes Irvine, you know? It was kinda like that. - Anybody home? - That's Johnson. - You killed Johnson? - I'll be back. - What's reality, Tom? - Listen, Saam, I'm not going to get into some psychological debates on the nature of reality. I want what you want. You just don't know it yet. I want what you want. You just don't know it yet. - Okay, that's the part we're gonna cut. I think this will work. Ah, this is lagging a little bit. Avid's so much easier to use. The orchestra would hit like that. Zoom! Some filmmakers have this idea that, if you rely too much on music, you're not doing your job as a filmmaker 'cause you're trying to manipulate the audience. And, you know, that's certainly a fair point and it depends on what kind of movie you're making and, sometimes, you don't want that. But music is one of your tools, like as a filmmaker you're manipulating the audience. That just kinda goes without saying. Even if you're trying to make like a hard-edged, you know, verite, just filming life, you're still manipulating the audience by what you're showing them. - Why would you say something so crass? - Say what? - About sucking me off. - I like dick, it's something I enjoy. - Yeah, but that's not the only reason I came over here, okay? - You don't have to say something to mean something. - You ever seen Hedgehog in the Fog? - No, what's that? - It's an animated movie. - No. - I thought all you Russians had seen it. - I'm Serbian, asshole. - Same difference. Hold on. We're just friends hanging out. - This is friends. - This is not friends. No. - I'm sorry. - This is not friends, right. - Okay. What do you want me to do, tell your fortune? - Yeah, actually, that sounds good. - Okay. This is your lifeline. - Mm-hm. - So, here. You're going to die. - Okay. - Today. The cross here, explosion. It's an explosion. - Mm-hm. - You'd like to have a blow job. - Okay, all right. - You'd like to have a blow job. - Yeah. Hold on, hold on. Do you understand, hold on, do you understand the concept of friendship? - Yeah, this is friends. - No, this is not friends, okay? I don't go and grab my friends fucking tits out of nowhere, right? I don't say, hey Kevin, I want to suck your fat cock. That's not friends here, all right? You understand? - I'm sorry. - There's nothing to be sorry about. - What, what do you want? Okay. - Listen, come here. - No! No! - Come here! - Why? - Come here, I wanna hang out with you. ♪ Some saw the color of my eyes ♪ ♪ In this kaleidoscope of faces ♪ - Oh, you fucking asshole, stop it! ♪ And the beauty of my name ♪ ♪ And the music resonates ♪ - Hello! - Aye, you guys remember Dianna from high school? - I always wanted to fuck her. - Oh, you know what?

Stupid fool. - Okay, drunkie. - Why you such a fool, man? - I'm down with whiskey, son. - All right, cheers to the ghost. - The ghost! - You talking to me? Huh? You know who I am? You know who I am? You know what I can do? You talking to me? You must be talking to me 'cause there's nobody else here. - Hey! Oh no, something's gone wrong!

Oh no, something's gone wrong! What's going on here? Not bad. I'm having a good time. - You know what this is about? - Yes. - This is your last time. This is your last time to backdown. - I understand. - You sure? - Yes. - Things will never be the same. - I understand. - Okay then. Congratulation yourself, welcome to the team. Go ahead and lie down, please. - I wanna grab a drink tonight. - You wanna go grab drinks every night. - I don't drink every night. I wanna have fun. Take me out then. - No. - Fine, I'll go with my friends. - Fuck your friends. - Go fuck yourself. - Listen, I don't want you going out with all your drugged out bitches, okay. Or all your fucking fag-hags from around town. - Oh, are you jealous? - Yeah. Yeah. I'm really jealous of your main gay, Neil. Fucking twinkle toes Neil. - Oh. I get it. You think that he wants to fuck me. - No, I think he already did fuck you. - Oh yeah. So good. He was so big. And so long. - Why you being so fucking ridiculous right now? - I'm not being ridiculous. - All right, at least somebody's getting fucked. Go do whatever the fuck you want. Get out of here. - I will. - What the fuck! Who's there? - Hey man. Hey man, why that dumb look on your face? You never seen a Bojangle before? Me either, man. I just made that shit up. What's that smell, man? You smoking some skunk or what? What you not going to offer some? Come on. Pass me the fucking weed, man, come on. Hurry up. All right, shit, now we're getting somewhere. Right, homeboy? Listen man, I know what you planning on doing and you know what? Whatever floats your boat, but you think things get easier on the other side? I'm sure that's what you think, but are you so sure? - Are you a spirit? A ghost? - Boo! Come on, man. Do I look like a fucking ghost to you? All I'm saying is that if you blow your brains out are you 100% certain that all your worries are going to go away? Whatever the fuck is going on with you. - Yes. Well, I won't exist. - But how do you know that? No, really, how the fuck do you know that? - Well, I can't be a hundred percent for sure. Look, you know what? You got this all wrong. I'm not trying to do what you think I'm trying to do. - Shit, I've been scoping you out and I'm no dummy. But if you want to fool yourself, go ahead and do it. I'm just saying you don't know that life's gonna be easier on the other side. That's all. - Maybe not, but it's probably better than this. - Maybe you're right, buddy? Maybe you're right. Hey, you got any of that whiskey left, champ? It's been a hell of a day. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Really? - It doesn't matter. - Yeah, it does. - No, it doesn't. - What is your problem? Why you acting like such a bitch? - You! You, you fuckhead! You fucking dick, you're smothering me! - There's the door. You wanna leave, get the fuck out. I've already seen... Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Stop. Stop. Hey. - Mm-hm. - Come here. Come here. - Stop! - Come here. - Seriously, stop. - What are you doing? - I'm not in the mood. - You're not in the fucking mood, bullshit! What was that? You're not in the fucking mood! What the fuck! - Do you love me? - What do you mean? - Exactly what I said. - I mean, you mean metaphysically or what? Like emotionally? - This isn’t Buddhism, you asshole. Don't you know what love is? - I mean the metaphysical part is not Buddhism. But, I don't know. - Well, I love you. - No, you don't. - You're a big baby. A child. A big, dumb child. - Okay. - I was getting picked up at the airport. And I was going through all the crowds and stuff trying to find my mom. And I knocked into someone and I looked down and I saw like a pair of shoes and, for some reason, I just like, I thought it was my dad. So, I like hugged this guy without looking up. And then I got really, really afraid because it could have been a random person. I didn't know who it was. And as I like stepped back and looked up to see who it was I just hugged, um, it was my dad. And I was relieved. - When I was 14 years old, I was walking with my friend Arthur. It was possibly in the fall or the winter. What I know for sure was that it was a dry day. One of those Santa Ana winds days. It's funny what details you remember. We were hanging out at my house playing video games and it was a Wednesday which was part of our routine because we would get out early from school. I believe we were playing Shinobi or possibly Strider. But it was on the Sega Genesis because I was one of the first kids to get one. We were having a great time. So, the sun was starting to go down and Arthur had to go home. And I would walk him halfway home. As we started walking, we stumbled upon a park. I remember he was walking a little ahead of me and I looked at him and, at that moment, I had this weird, controlled rage come over me. So, I started to push Arthur unprovoked. Arthur was confused. He didn't know what was going on. So, he said, hey, what are you doing, man? But I persisted. I kept provoking him until he started to fight back. And, because he started to fight back, I went into full dominance because I knew I had speed over him. Arthur was kind of a heavy set kid. So, I pinned him down. I picked him up and I slammed him. Arthur struggled. You know, he fought back with all his might. But he was outmatched and, after a while, he just gave up. With tears in his eyes, he looked at me, totally confused. Arthur turned around and started walking away. I had no idea what came over me. It came from a place of darkness, one that I'm still not in control of. I don't think any of us are. And sometimes I think, without those darkest nights, the light of day can't exist.
