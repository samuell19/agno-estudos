Beyond space and time, lies a dimension where life has evolved into machines, and the most dangerous weapon in the universe is a force called love. We've detected an unidentified spacecraft approaching the citadel. They are not responding to our transmissions. They're going to smash into the energy field if they don't slow down. Something's wrong. The energy shields are dropping. Impossible. Red alert. Energy shield has been deactivated. All units stand by. Situation critical, Situation critical. All units proceed to the citadel. Ah, what you got there, a karaoke machine? I don't know what it is, but it's gonna bury us in gold-coated plastic for years to come. Better find a good place to hide it, in case we get boarded by the interplanetary goon squad. Yeah, I'll just tuck it away in one of these junkers over here. Gonna have to talk to Krogarr about using our ship as a storage unit. You think if we sold this for scrap, he would notice? Ah, if you know Krogarr, he's got inventory on everything. Yeah, I hear ya. For thousands of years, the Arculon Destroyer has protected our planet from the intergalactic hoards that would seek to strip of its resources. We must activate the Destructivas. Only their primitive warlike ways can save us. The Destructivas are too unpredictable. They may elect to destroys us themselves. We have no choice. Once word gets out that the Arculon is gone, our world will be picked apart from all sides. Are you sure you want to do this? Once they're out, there's no turning back. Do it. You have reached the doors of enlightenment. To open the gates and advance to the next level, you must choose. The all-seeing heart of love, or the chainsaw of destruction. One will take you into a world of joy and happiness. Hmm. Ugh. The other will take you to a place of death and destruction. Ah, yes! Hey. Take it easy. I'm just an employee! Who dares awaken us from our slumber? Please. We mean you no harm. What year is this? The year is 8675309. Our world is in desperate need of your capabilities. I was having the strangest dream. Everything was green and I was made of water. For thousands of years while you slept, our world has evolved into a utopia, free from war and strife. Our utopia's come to rely on a super weapon called the Arculon Destroyer. It has been stolen from us. We are now defenseless against the thousands of worlds that hunger for our resources. This weapon is so important to you, yet you lose it so easily. Why do you call on us? We need your help to hunt down the Arculon and return it to us so we may defend our world. Clean up your own messes. I was one step away from enlightenment, you droogs. Retrieve the Arculon Destroyer and you will be returned to the dream existence with which you were extracted. Never to be bothered again. You have our word. They have proven to be honorable custodians of our hyper sleep. Mytra? I'm on board with whatever you want to do. I dunno. Ugh. All right then. We accept your terms. We've located the Arculon heading 38 degrees towards the outer rim of the galaxy. Most likely to be delivered to one of the many pirates that reside in that sector. We have your coordinates locked in. We will bring back your weapon. May the eternal drums of the night guide your way. Okay, get on with it. This is cargo transport vessel Egulon Nepsis, reporting heavy damage. Reactor core has ruptured. Engines are inoperative. Our weapons have been disabled. Please send repair crew at the earliest possible convenience. This is cargo transport vessel Egulon Nepsis, reporting heavy damage. Reactor has ruptured. Engine- So what are you gonna do with all the tokens you're about to make? Trog not think so much about future. Trog always in present. Trog enjoy journey. Not so much destination. Hey, it's a Kro mission! Hello my friends. How was your mission? Let me tell you, it's been quite the adventure. And a successful one I might add. That's what I like to hear. Uh, you will all be rewarded mightily. May the solar winds guide you to your salvation. Or whatever. What'd I tell you guys? Crime pays and pay is good. Ha! Yeah, but just think what we can do if we had the right tools. What are you getting at, Strobo? Time travel. Balderdash! No! It's the opposite of balderdash! Look, we find some time crystals, recalibrate a hyperspace drive to fold space time, go back before the beginning of all of this, and I don't know, go on "Wheel of Non-Fungibility". We'd be a big hit. Balderdash! We are representatives sent by the Planet Radia to retrieve the Arculon Destroyer. Stand down now and prepare to be boarded. Balderdash! I think our ship just exploded. It matters not. We will take theirs. Come on, they just landed the boarding craft. Haunted. Ghosts. Come on, we'll squeeze through the service tube! All right, everybody just settle down now. Where is the Arculon? Gone. We delivered it yesterday. Wrong! We traced the signal. You'll never find it on this ship. I hid it good. Ha! Found it. Everybody freeze! Like I said, free- Ah! Don't make another move or I'll push the button. Young lady, you have no idea what you're messing with. I don't suppose it's too late to work out a deal? All right, into the escape pod. Don't make me push this button. Get in there. We have 600 tokens coming our way. We don't mind splitting it with you. Move it. You know what, you can take it all. Just take me with you. I'm good in a fight. These guys are cramping my style anyway. Well you are. We leave you with your lives. Others have not been so lucky. Pull that lever on your right. This is cargo transport vessel Egulon Nepsis reporting heavy damage. Reactor core has ruptured. Engines are inoperative. Our weapons have been disabled. Please send a repair crew at the earliest possible convenience. Egulon Nepsis reporting heavy damage. Reactor core has- This transmission makes no sense. Our weapons... Why reveal you have no weapons? Foolish mechanoids. Or it's a trap. But if it's not... I feel we must know for sure. You know how good deeds go. Weapons have been disabled. Please send repair crew at earliest possible convenience. This is cargo transport vessel Egulon Nepsis. It could be us in another life. We'll see. Our weapons... Mytra. Prepare a boarding craft. Roger. Prepping the boarding craft. If it's a trap, we'll make them pay. That we will, sister. That we will. "Mytra do this, Mytra do that." I wanna be in charge! Mytra. Your radio's still on. Oh. This is cargo transport vessel Egulon Nepsis reporting heavy damage... We've got a heavy cruiser closing in, sir. Sensors indicate the pirate ship Corsair. Excellent. Our plan is coming to fruition. Prepare to activate the troopers. Yes sir. Ready yourselves, vermin. Prepared to be rescued. Well, have we seen enough? It seems your instincts are not without merit. Come on out, we're here to help. See that? What'd I tell you. My faith in your skepticism has been restored. We better find an exit. Mytra! They have defeated our troopers. Activate the weapon! Weapon activated. So cold. Tell my holo-cats I love them. Oh, stop it, you got a tiny scratch. Now get up so we can get outta here. I am peacekeeper. Prototype Exoria One. I have been tasked with your apprehension. Yeah sister, that's just not gonna work out for you. Deactivate yourselves immediately and you will not be harmed. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Whoa! Is that all you've got? You wait till I get my- I have a red cat, a blue cat, a purple one. I've got a silver one too, and a gray one. Will the defendants please step forward. Blow it out your gasket, lead head. We are not who you think we are. This has all been a case of mistaken identity. Where are we? We, the representatives of the Third Robot Empire's justice division, hereby find you guilty of deep space piracy and resistance of apprehension. Wait, don't we get a lawyer? I am certain their decision has been made. We hereby sentence you to a minimum of 1,000 years of hard labor in the mining colonies of Arborus Seven. You can hereby kiss my shiny metal- Aah... We've got a transmission coming in from the lead ship. Put it through. Lower your defenses, people of Radia. You no longer possess the Arculon Destroyer and cannot withstand our attack. We don't fear you, vultures. Turn back now before we pulverize you. I guess you scared them off. Where are you, Destructivas? Step off the pad and proceed toward the assimulation facility for orientation. I've got a better idea. Why don't you give me that staff, so I can shove it up your... Aah! We are not here to make trouble. Krogarr, we've got a coded transmission coming in from one of our spies on Arborus Seven. Put it through. Captain Krogarr, this is Agent Worlow. Three inmates just arrived at Arborus Seven. They fit the description of the three warriors who hijacked the Corsair several days ago. Over. Good work Worlow. Prepare to receive extraction details. You will each be issued plasma blasters to break down metal ore infused within the asteroid walls. A truck and crane unit will be by periodically to pick up the products of your labor. You must meet a daily quota of four tons or you will be taken to the furnace, melted down, and recycled into patio furniture. This is our last chance. No one expects us to attack. Agreed. We act now. Wait, what? Trust me, now is not the time. What's it to you? I've got a line on something. You might be interested. Better turn around. What? Not now. Remember. You break the rules, you pay the price. The Centuries are shielded against the plasma blasters, if you're wondering. You like being a prisoner, that's your business. I'm gonna escape or kill myself trying. In about 30 seconds, my time as a prisoner will come to an end. Keep your head down and so will yours. Here we go. Let's move. Where's Azalla? Return to your work stations immediately! Or be destroyed! I've got you, boss. Initiate self destruct sequence. Mission accomplished. Reel us back in. We're all on board. Hit the gas. Get off of me you dolt! Wilhelm scream! Oh! What a world, what a world, what a world. Ah, these must be the great warriors I've heard so much about. We've seen better days. What do you want with us? Straight to the point. I like that. Several days ago I sent a group of my best warriors, or so I thought, to obtain the device called the Arculon Destroyer. We lost all contact with our comrades and we can only assume they've either been lost or destroyed. What is this, how do you say, Arculon Destroyer? Yeah, what's an Arculon Destroyer? That's not important right now. We've tracked its location to an impound unit on Taurus Five. An interplanetary justice location. We need a skilled band of raiders, such as yourselves, to break into it. You want us to raid an outpost? We raid an outpost. I can't believe our luck. What are the chances? He's delivering the Arculon Destroyer right into our hands. Better play it cool. Yeah, this is all very interesting. What's in it for us? I can't believe they're falling for this. I really am a criminal mastermind. Better play it cool. You get an autographed picture of me and I let you live. And I'll pay you 600 credits. If you want us to do heavy lifting, we will need weapons. Hey! An unidentified ship has just entered the outpost perimeter. Activate sentries. We're approaching the drop zone. Are you ready for launch? Just get on with it. Hello, Worlow. Have we provided the distraction you've been looking for? I'm all clear. Moving towards the impound as we speak. This isn't the impound. Sorry to do this to you, but the impound was too heavily guarded and I needed someone to distract the patrols. You have performed your roles with the greatest enthusiasm. Please feel free to keep the docking ship and as many tokens as you can carry. Krogarr out. Is trap? We were decoys the whole time. Please enter the correct ignition code. I did enter the correct code. Mothership has departed. Ugh, we've been had! I am peacekeeper prototype Exoria Two. I have been tasked with your apprehension. Deactivate yourselves immediately and you will not be harmed. Ugh. Here we go again! We need some sort of magnetic vacuum cleaner. This is peacekeeper prototype Exoria Two requesting back uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh... Help me! Help me! Help me! Let's get out of here. Engine requires maintenance. Come on, Don't cut out now. The Corsair has been located and retrieved, Krogarr. En route to docking as we speak. It's a teleportation platform. Yes. But to where? Let's find out. Oh, no. Will the defendants please step forward? How about I step forward, remove your head, and shove it up your- You have been accused of prison escape, illegal recycling, breaking and entering, piracy, and destruction of private property. You forgot the murder of three public officials. Good one. Don't help them. You have been sentenced to serve out the remainder of your existence on the inter-dimensional prison planetoid of Interprison. May the great programmer have mercy on your circuits. Someone should have mercy on your ugly- Aah... Surrender now, people of Radia. And we promise to only torture three-thirds of the left sides of your bodies and four-quarters of your right side. The force field generators can't withstand this bombardment for much longer. We may need to contemplate surrender. Where are you, Destructivas? What is this place? We appear to be inside an artificial planetoid in a pocket dimension. If so, the skies would be impenetrable. It appears we are not alone. Get in quick! This place is gonna be swarming with berzerkers any second now! All aboard! They made it back. Lower the drawbridge. Uh oh. Ah. You answered that distress signal, didn't ya? Any way off this rock? Unfortunately this planet has been placed in a pocket dimension. There's no conventional way of escape. Lucky for us, Strobo built that time machine over there. Thank you, Max. While you're at it, why don't you just give 'em the launch codes so they can steal it and leave us here stranded. Look. We'd take you with us, but we only have enough time crystals for the four of us. We'll leave you the karaoke machine in case you get bored. ♪ Ahoo hey-eh-eh-eh ♪ This, this is unfortunate. The fate of the universe is at stake and we are trapped here. The poor Radians. Left defenseless against the scourges of the galaxy. While that mad man Krogarr roams the galaxy with a doomsday weapon. Yeah, Strobo! Have some compassion, man. Strobo mean. Yeah, Strobo. You're just mean. Mean, man. Selfish. All right, already! I'll do what I can. Who wants to go out there with me and find some more time crystals? All right, you guys hold down the fort and you all don't even think about using your feminine wiles to extract the codes from these bumpkins. They've got years of... No they don't. Trog ticklish. Now Trog tickle you. Try not to be distracted by my sensuous movements, Auto. I know what you're trying to do, Luna. I am like the Alturian devil snake, no? It's not gonna work. My mind's like a box of concrete. Nothing's getting in or out. Oh yeah, a little to the right. No offense, but Trog better at this than you. Yeah, less talk more drumming, pal. "Whoa, whoa, what are we gonna do?" It's me, Max, here to save your butts again. The protector of the universe. "Oh, Max, you saved us again!" I know. It's what I do. "Oh, how are you so awesome?" I don't know. I just am. "I love you, Max!" I know. "Wait, don't leave us!" I'm back! I'm back again. To protect the universe. "Oh, we love you, Max." I know, but I can't stay here for long. Sorry. I gotta save the universe again! "We love you Max!" "I wish you could stay!" Hello, Max. What are you doing? Playing with my toys. Ooh. Can I play too? Sure. Hey, look at me. I'm an innocent little robot girl, trapped on a planet with no way to escape. If we only had the launch codes to the time machine! Mmm. Tell me the launch codes, Max. What's that? You ate all of the donuts? This relationship is over. Save your tears for someone else. Oh, I can't stay mad at you. Mmm. Hmm. That looks familiar. Bunch of bull slag. 1 8 9 7 3 2 4 8. Well that wasn't too hard. Everybody buckled up? They are a curious lot. I detect a small pang. Is this guilt? Sure, a little bit. Maybe we wait till Strobo returns. We all leave together like big happy family. Nah, let's just go. Yeah, let's go. Yes, they will understand. Alright. It was a harrowing adventure, but I managed to find some more time crystal... All right. Who gave away the launch codes? Ha ha! Hey, where'd they go? Max! I should have known. Et tu, Auto. Seems like Trog and I are the only ones pulling our weight in this glorious operation. Trog ready to leave dopey friends behind with great enthusiasm. Where the girls at? Well at least we got the karaoke machine. Well, nevermind. That's gone too. Hmm. Uh. Where are we? We've gone back to the time of the initial raid. They've just stolen the Arculon Destroyer. We can strike now and return the Arculon before any of this happens. It won't work. How would we exist right now? They would have no reason to wake us up. You're thinking about this too much. In gold-coated plastic for years to come. Better find a good place to hide it, in case we get boarded by the interplanetary goon squad. Yeah, I'll just tuck it away in one of these junkers over here. Gonna have to talk to Krogarr about using our ship... Hide! You think if we sold this for scrap, he would notice? If you know Krogarr, he's got inventory on everything. Yeah, I hear ya. Trog, I'm starting to believe this ship is haunted. That or we're gonna have to start overhauling the wiring on this jalopy. Hmm. Must have picked up some space ghosts. Whoa! Yeah! Finally making some gains! Whoa! Ah! I think there's something wrong with the artificial gravity. Oh, I'm think I'm gonna be sore tomorrow. Haunted. Ghosts. Come on, we'll squeeze through the service tube! All right, everybody just settle down now. Where is the Arculon? Gone. We delivered it yesterday. Wrong! We traced the signal. You'll never find it on this ship. I hid it good. Ha! Found it. This is cargo transport vessel Egulon Nepsis reporting heavy damage. Reactor core has ruptured. Engines are inoperative. Our weapons have been disabled. Please send repair crew at the earliest possible convenience. Ah. How young we were. And naive. Many lessons we have learned. The ship appears to empty. Make sure you check the cargo bay. Whoa, easy. The gravity is all wonky. Place is haunted. Looks like we've got some time to kill. Any suggestions? We might as well help our past selves in their futile escape. Engine requires maintenance. Come on, don't cut out now. This is peacekeeper prototype Exoria Two requesting back uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh... Help me! Help me! Help me! Let's get outta here. Help me! We've safely entered hyperspace, Krogarr. There are no ships in pursuit. Excellent. I'll be down in the docking bay. Hold my calls. We've got a transmission coming in from Mohana. Should we ignore it? Put him through. Krogarr! It's been a long time, my old friend. I've heard chatter amongst the stars that you've raided a certain little outpost? Well, yes. And would you believe it? We've managed to carry away all 6 billion tokens that we owe you. Krogarr. I never doubted you for more than a few millennia. I'll have my minions transmit the coordinates for our rendezvous. May the solar winds guide your way, et cetera, et cetera. Whatever. Just bring me my stuff. Well there it is. The infamous Arculon Destroyer. You know how to work this thing? If it's galactic domination you desire, then by pushing the big red button, you will acquire. I'm not picking up anything on the sensors. Are you sure they're coming? They'll be here. I owe that goon a lot of money. I knew they wouldn't disappoint. Prepare the Arculon Destroyer. Open up a channel. Krogarr. For once in my many lives, I'm happy to see you! Now, Mohana. I confess, I may have exaggerated a little bit on the 6 billion tokens. You dare to hoodwink the great and powerful Mohana! Give me one reason not to blast you into radioactive space dust. You deceitful charlatan! Now Mohana, I know we've had our differences. I've defaulted on a few loans, yes, I may or may not have destroyed some of your space stations, and I assure you, had I known they were your space stations... Captain Krogarr, the Arculon Destroyer is ready. You know what Mohana, I've had it up to here with your ranting and raving and complaining. You knuckle dragging moron. You primitive sub-humanoid being with your paid escorts and your sycophantic followers. I think it's about time you learned who's really the boss around here. Krogarr! There will be no forgiveness. Activate the Arculon Destroyer. The Arculon Destroyer?! How can this be? ♪ Ahoo hey-eh-eh-eh ♪ Oh boy. Destroy that ship! Have a nice life, Krogarr. Whoa, what happened back there? Ah, who cares? We've got nothing but the future ahead of us. Yes. The boundless freedoms of our dreams awaits us. I'll get you, Destructivas. Somehow, someway, I'll get you. It appears we may be too late. Better late than never, let's get this thing hooked up. It's time for distraction, no? Help me! I am peacekeeper prototype Exoria Two. I have not been tasked with your apprehension. Deactivate yourselves immediately and you will not be harmed. Do yourself a favor and run, little girl. Events are about to get apocalyptic. Distraction achieved. Let's go! Mercy. There will be no mercy this day. Without your precious Arculon Destroyer, you're nothing but fodder for my hoards of barbarous warriors. Who dares interrupt my poetic pontifications. Um, I give up. I was just leaving. Thank you. Uh, I have an announcement to make! They have the Arculon Destroyer. Run for your lives! You have done well, Destructivas. But your story is not over yet. You got your weapon back, now return us to our dream world. All right, what's going on? I'm gonna go look for a broom. You're not the only ones with a time machine. We traveled back in time 10,000 years, introduced the Arculon Destroyer, and brought peace in this once war-torn world. Just to see the looks on your faces. And to be honest, I'm a little disappointed. 10,000 years! Poker faces. Now, if you don't mind. We can get 600 coupons for delivering this bad boy to Krogarr. So step aside. Well, you better go back in time to about 10 hours ago. 'Cause Krogarr is now a dead-garr. Surprise! I'm back, baby. Thought you could pull one over on me, did ya? Back away from that Arculon Destroyer or I'll fry your circuits. Bite me, Krogarr. To enter the gates of enlightenment, you must choose. The all-seeing heart of love, or the chainsaw of destruction. What are you doing in my dream? We're here to help you choose. This is an important decision. Hmm. I built my whole life around this moment. Now that I have the Arculon Destroyer, I can destroy my enemies and anyone else who gets in my way. Wait. Are we still getting paid? Are you kidding me? You idiots are the worst bunch of criminals I've ever had the displeasure of working with. I'll buy you a slice of pizza, but nothing more. That's fair. I like pizza. - That's fair. - I like pizza. - I love pizza! Foolish mortals. You cannot stop the architects of annihilation. The executors of extinction. Bow down before your destroyers. Or be destroyed. Not so fast, Mohana. Take one more step and I push this button. Your threats mean nothing to me, Krogarr. Now put down that toy. And eliminate yourself, so I may refrain from lifting my arms. Easy, Krogarr, you have no idea the power you're about to unleash. Yeah, man. That thing's hotter than a supernova. Don't push it. Push it! No, don't push it. Push it! Yeah! Trust has led to much chaos. Maybe chainsaw would be best. Trust isn't such a bad thing. I trust you. Sometimes it works out. You guys aren't helping much. I can't believe I'm saying this, but can everyone just relax for a second? She's right. Everyone relax. Nah! Look, a few minutes ago, I'd be the first person to split a head open or chop an arm off. But I think right now we need to use our heads. I can't help but think we've been drawn here together for a reason. That we're meant for something bigger. We have to figure this out. And not with our fists, but with our brains. Our computers, our hearts. Our hearts.
