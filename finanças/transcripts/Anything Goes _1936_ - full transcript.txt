- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes # In olden days a glimpse of stocking # # Was looked on as something shocking # # Now heaven knows # # Anything goes # - Where's Billy? - He hasn't shown up yet. Fine pal, I'm sailing tonight he doesn't even show. Oh, he'll be here. Keep your shirt on. You fool, so you finally got here! I'm sorry to be late but I had big business. - Hello, all. - Hello, Billy. Oh, gee, Billy I wish you were sailing with us. - So do I. - Why don't you? A vacation will do you good. - We'll have a lot of fun together in London. - I know, but what's the use of talking? The boss is going away and he's leaving me in full charge. Now, if I make good, he's going to promote me from general manager to junior partner. - And what does that mean? - What does it mean? Well, uh... what does it mean? Well, maybe $10 more a week or something. - Success! - And that's not all. Next year I'm going away and I'll leave the boss in charge. Now, if the kid makes good, I'm going to make him junior partner... ...and that makes me the senior partner, get it? Yeah, I get it. I get everything. Except what I want. # My story is much too sad to be told # # But practically everything # # Leaves me totally cold # # The only exception I know is the case # # When I'm out on a quiet spree # # Fighting vainly the old ennuie # # And I suddenly turn and see # # Your fabulous face # # I get no kick from champagne # # Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all # # So tell me why should it be true # # That I get a kick out of you # # Some like that perfume from Spain # # I'm sure that if I took even one sniff # # That would bore me # # Terrifically too # # Yet I get a kick out of you # # I get a kick every time I see # # You standing there before me # # I get a kick though it's clear to me # # You obviously don't adore me # # I get no kick in a plane # # Flying to high with some guy # # In the sky # # Is my idea of nothing to do # # Yet I get a kick out of you # I beg your pardon, but... I couldn't help but noticing you seem to be in some trouble or something. Could I... could I help you? Oh, thanks. You're Miss Hope Harcourt, ain't you? Yes. I got a message for you, will you come outside? Don't go, miss, they're... Got a watch? Sit where you are. And don't move for five minutes. Now be a good little boy. Well, what's the idea? Uh... go... go away. What are you doing over here? Nothing... I'll be with you in a minute. In about two minutes and thirty-six seconds. - Say what is this, a gag or something? - No. Get your fares here for the Steamship Americana. - Here she comes! - Who? Reno and her widows! Hello, Reno, how about a picture? Hello, Billy! Here, come on, this way, kids. Watch the kid get off, folks, are you ready, girls? One, two, three, four. And one, two, three, straight. And one, two, three, straight. And one, two, three, hold it! Oh... hello, boss, I've been looking all over the boat for you. Hello, Billy, I hardly expected you to... You didn't think I was going to let you leave without saying goodbye, did you? - It'll only be a minute. Where'll you be? - If I'm not at the chapel, I'll be in the bar. Come on, kids! Right here, please, Bishop, thank you very much indeed. - Snuff your shutter, Rembrandt. - Who do you got there? A missionary and a couple of celestials. Take the missionary for a walk and I'll get you a real pitcher. - Okay, kid. - Oh, Bishop... Uh, would you give me a little dope about yourself? But my photograph, I thought... But we want to get a picture of you walking up the stairs. - Oh, I see. - What is the purpose of this trip, Bishop? Oh, I'm on my way to attend the West Minister Conference. Confidentially, do you wish to cable your English correspondent? The entire conference will be at the Southampton docks to welcome me. And our Chinese body will be there also to do honor to my boys. That's all very interesting. It'll make a swell story for our Chinese edition. - What are those guys doing down here? - Who are they? - They're G-men. - G-men? Yeah, they're here for a pinch. Hello, Mr. Whiskers. - Wise guy. - Yeah! Oh, you're not down here for the ride. Give me the story. Maybe there won't be any story. We're looking for a couple of mugs, that's all. - They're trying to make a getaway. - Well, who are they? - Maybe I can help you out. - One of them's dressed up like a preacher. All ashore that's going ashore! All ashore that's going ashore! I beg your pardon. All ashore that's going ashore! You oughta look where you're going. Hey, fix the violin, fix the violin! Bonnie, it scares me to death, I'll never get used to this thing. Well, anyway you got on alright. Yeah, but I'm going to get into trouble in this getup. I don't know how to act like a minister. I don't see why I couldn't have been a cowboy or an Indian squaw or something. Now, you look great in that preacher suit, Mooney. I'd hardly know you myself. Now just keep your head and we'll make a clean getaway. I'll go find Snake Eyes. Hey, Bonnie, Bonnie! Charlie! Wayne! Oh, Charlie! Oh, Wayne! Oh, Ch... Doctor, I beg your pardon. May I present myself? The name is Bishop Henry T. Dobson. Yeah, hello, hello, Bish. Are you... are you on your way to the conference? Uh... no, no, no, I think I'll go to bed early tonight. No, no, I mean the West Minister Conference. Well, you see, I'm not exactly a West Minister. I'm more in the East. I see. Well Doctor, may I ask, what is your field? Well, I'm a kind of a sort of uh... Uh... missionary. - Missionary! - Yeah. - Where? - Oh, way out in China. - China? - Yeah... way out in China. Why! Singular thing! I've served in China for years. - Oh, yes? - Yes! Well, uh... You see, I wasn't exactly in China, - I was more in uh... - Oh, I see, you, you were in Indochina. Yeah, yeah, yeah... I was in Indochina and you was in... ...Outdoorchina. Well, we shall see lots of each other, I hope, and... I'll see you later. Yeah, well, make it as late as possible, won't you? Oh, pai-ong-lei, long long lei! Well, I don't know, maybe the captain will tell you about that, I... A hundred and nineteen and three quarters. Settled. I got you, Mr. Whitney. That's fine, William. I think that's everything. Remember, William, I'm depending on you. And I won't let you down, sir. Pleasant voyage. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Moon, come here. - What's the matter? There's a couple of dicks on board and they're looking for you and Snake Eyes. - Wha-h-h-h-how do you know? - I've been trailing them. Y-y-y-you better take the harmonica. Where can I hide? Stay away from your cabin, they're watching that. - Get into a group. - But... get into a what? Get into a group of passengers. I'll find you later. - Hey Billy! - Billy, here we are! Glad you weren't in the chapel. Well, I just got time for one short bonus, then I gotta go. You know the boat's gonna sail in a minute. Oh, Billy, come on along. - Sure, stay with the group. - You know I can't, Reno. But Billy, I can't have any fun in London without you. What do you mean, you'll be a riot in London. You'll have those monocles dropping in your lap like flowers. - Is that so? - I want you there too. - I'll be there. - Say, Doctor, would you mind converting somebody else, I'm beyond help, I think. Well, that's me. Time to get off. That's him. There he is. Let's go. Now Billy, this is your last chance. Are you sailing with me or aren't you? You know I'd love to, but I've got to work. Listen, listen, why can't we be grouping? - Holy tomatoes! - Oh, that man is in again! Hey, widows, hey! Listen, will you sort of kick this fellow around till he gets lost? Wayne! Charlie! Whe... I beg your pardon, have you seen anything of two Chinese gentlemen? No, sir, no, sir. The clergy's imposing on me, honey. - Good evening, Bishop. - Oh, how do you do? - You are the Bishop? - Oh, yes, my name's Henry T. Dobson. - D-D-L-L-V-D-A. - Okay, this way. - I know, but gentlemen... - Hold it a second, Bishop. All ashore that's going ashore. All ashore that's going ashore. Listen, I'll tell you what you do. You grab yourself a place up there on the upper deck and I'll be waving for you. Make that last until you get back. - Bye, kids! - Bye! Well, are you coming down or are you going up? Make up your mind, sir. Are you coming aboard or going ashore? Gangway! # The sailor's life is supposed to be # # A heck of a lot of fun # # Yeah, but when you're a sailor # # Take it from me # # You're working like a son of a gun # # They give us jobs of every kind # # And chores of every sort # # But sweat away, sailor, you don't mind # # Cause you know when we hit port # # There will always be a lady fair # # A Jenny fair or a Sadie fair # # There'll always be a lady fair # # Who's waiting there for you # # There will always be a lady fair # # To smooth your troubles # # And to muss your hair # # There'll always be a lady fair # # Who's waiting there for you # # There will always be a woman's charms # # To kill your worries and to fill your arms # # There'll always be a lady fair # # Who's waiting there for you # Hello! Billy! So you're sailing with me after all. Oh, I'm so happy! What happened? Well... you see, there's a girl on this boat. - A girl. - The most beautiful face I've ever seen. - So! - Well, she's in danger. Well, who is she, what kind of danger? - I... I don't know. - You don't know who she is? - No. - Or what kind of danger she's in? Uh-uh. When I asked you to sail with me you couldn't, you had big business! - Well... I had. - Yeah, and you stayed aboard on her account! So your heart was full of deceit and it was just a runaround you were giving me! Well, Reno, I never made a play for you. Never had a man make a stronger play. You made me think you wanted to marry me! Oh, now, how could you think that, I... I only treated you with respect. That's just it! If you weren't on the level then why did you treat me with respect? Did you ever try to get me drunk? No! Did you ever ask me up to your apartment to look at your etchings? No! We've been in taxis dozens of times. Did you ever try to kiss me? No, not a try! Billy, you shouldn't have let me on like that if you didn't mean it! Why, Reno, I didn't try to mislead you. Yes you did! You never even laid your hand on me. And I'm not used to men treating me like that! We... well... we're on our way. That's a nice piece of guessing, Doc. I want to thank you for what you did for me, it was a great favor. Well, I don't know what it was but whatever it was, you're welcome to it. Yeah... yeah... You mind if I park the frame? - No, put it... - I mean... sit down? Go ahead. You see, when you surrounded me with all those girls you... ...you hid me from some people I didn't want to see. Yes, I know. I can't say goodbyes either, that's why I'm on this boat. I couldn't say goodbye to a girl. Now I'm in a devil of a fix. - Uh... pardon me, Reverend. - The devil with that. Well, anyway, you did me a favor, maybe I could do you one. You look awful sad, you must have something on your mind. Well, it's nothing you can help. It's money. I know you Ministers haven't got much of that. Oh, if it's money you want, I can get some of that. - Can you? - Why, sure! The fellow that's sailing with me has got about fifty grand. Uh... fifty thousand dollars with him. I'll just go get him. Mooney! - Bonnie, Bonnie, where's Mr. Hill? I was just going to tell you, he didn't make the boat. He di... why, did the cops get him? I mean... was he forcibly detained? I don't know about that, he just never showed. Oh me, oh my, oh moo. Uh-oh... wait a minute, wait a minute. Do you suppose we could get the money back on his ticket? Is that a ticket? Oh, that's just as good as money! Well, if it's a ticket you want, you can have that one. Of course we may have to share the same bedroom but I... - I guess there's two bunks in it. - Why, that's all right. Thanks awfully, Reverend. Yes, what is it you wanted? - Fix me up. Oh, excuse me, mister... uh... This is the little lady that goes with Mr. Hill. How... You don't mean that she goes with the ticket. Yeah... well, I thought perhaps maybe she might... Oh no, Reverend, you'll have to assume responsibility for her. Thank you. Oh, I was afraid of this. - Uh... Mister... mister... - Crocker, Billy Crocker. - Oh, it's a pleasure to know you. - Glad to see you. Say... do you suppose you could use his passport? No, I don't think I'll have to land. Still, it might come in handy. Heaven help me if they ever look at this picture. Oh, well, we could fix that up alright. Pardon me, Reverend, may I take a picture of you and your party? Oh, no, no... not me! Uh, no, not with me, but I'd like a picture of my friend here. Oh, no, hey, I don't... - Be sure you get a good close picture. - I see. Here, can I come in? What's the matter, ain't he got a number? Mooney! - Number? - Oh, skip it, I thought I was somewhere else. Ready? Done! We expected the girl'd make trouble, holler for the cops or something. But she fooled us. She came along quiet as a lamb. Probably didn't want to make trouble for her family's sake. Important Britishers, aren't they? Must be. When she fell in love with this guy they run him right out of England. - But she ups and follows him. - What was he like? Good-looking. Smooth and as crooked as a snake. Made a business of trimming rich dames. Then her old man got busy on the transatlantic telephone... ...and before her boat docked in New York, everything was set for her. She hadn't a chance. Oh, be fair, Hope. As an old friend of the family I couldn't refuse your father's request. Yes, but you needn't have been so melodramatic about it. - Hiring gunmen. - Private detectives, Miss. Well, it's the same thing, you carry guns, don't you? Why didn't you come for me yourself, Evie? I was taking no chances. My job was to get you quietly and safely on board ship and take you home. So I arranged... I arranged a snitch. - Snatch. - Snatch. - Uh, that'll be all, my man. - Yes, sir. You had a... Excuse me... I gotta see a fellow. We'll uh... we'll wander around the boat and wait for you. They'd better hurry. Better hurry up, the pilot's ready to shove off. Oh, so you thought you were going to lose me, huh? Listen, I wanna know what you did to that girl? The girl that came on the ship... Better investigate this guy. He tried to interfere with us once before. Come on. Where... where are they? Stop them, they... - They kidnapped that girl. - Who are you? - What's your name? - I... I... My name is Hill. - Got your passport with you? - Why... no. - Where is it? - It's in my cabin. Go and get it and bring it up to the purser's office. The captain will want to talk to you. Come on. - Give me a light, Evie. - Oh, I beg your pardon. Oh, Evie, be careful! Oh, it's down on the ledge, I'll get it. I say, do be careful, darling, you know you'll go overboard. Now look, hold on to my ankles, I won't... - I'll give you a hoist. - All right. There we go. Well, what are you doing, counting the stars? It's... Hm, pretty girl, huh? - That fellow tried to murder her. - He did? I'm going up there see what's the matter. Wait a minute, wait a minute, maybe he packs a gat. - Huh? - Before you talk to him you wanna fan him. - Fan him, fan him, what's that? - Oh, like this. Slap his hip pockets to make sure he doesn't carry a gun. And this is to make sure he doesn't carry a shoulder holster. - That's right. - Okay. If you need any help, call me. Lovely night, isn't it? You like that suit as well as the, uh... stuff they're wearing this year? - I beg your pardon? - No offense, man, but uh... - Could you give me the name of your tailor? - My tailor is in London! - Is he happy there? - You will excuse us now, won't you? I say, I hope we have a calm voyage. The slightest movement makes me seasick. It's a bit of a swell, isn't it? I simply loathe being bounced about. It happens to be one of the roughest places on the coast. My dear, it's getting worse. All this is nothing to what it will be in a few minutes. I wonder if the good old dining room is open. I could use a light snack. Maybe a little liver and an ice cream with uh... chocolate sauce or... - Oh, my dear fellow, please. - Maybe a good old Yarmouth bloater... ...stuffed with p?t?. Or some watermelon and peanut butter, I think that would be nice. - Oh, no, I ask you, no. - Oh, there's a big one! I say, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go down and prepare for death. - Now was that fair? - Fair? Say, I didn't shoot him, I didn't push him overboard or anything. I think it was more than fair. - Listen, I want to help you. - Help me? I don't need any help. You're very brave but you're not fooling me because I know you're in danger. - I just want to be your friend. - I don't know what you're talking about. All right, all right, don't tell me anything. But I just want you to know from now on you're safe. No matter what they try to do I'm going to be here to protect you. There's nothing going to separate us, nothing! I don't care if there's a whole army... I'll see you a little later. I'll find him if it takes all night to do it. The swell must be over. When I got down the ship was steady as a... Say, there's that eccentric fellow again. Has he been talking to you? Yes, he has. Now, my dear, you don't know who or what he may be. I don't like the look of him myself. Why, I think he's rather nice looking. Oh, uh... the purser's still waiting for you, Mr. Hill. My, he certainly keeps late hours, doesn't he? In an emergency, yes. You have your passport, Mr. Hill? Why, uh... why, yes. Well, then let's not keep him waiting any longer. # Oh, steer by the North Star # # Look out for the moon # # Sailor, beware, beware # # Beware of your heart # # One night of moonlight # # Can start a typhoon # # Sailor, beware, beware # # Beware of your heart # # Unfold that emotion # # Whatever you do # # Somebody lies over the ocean # # And lies in wait for you # # Love can't be found # # With a compass or chart # # So be smart, sailor beware # # Be careful and watch your heart # # See the world across that old Pacific # # Where the gals are # # All terrific if you like some Oriental # # See the world across that old Atlantic # # Where the gals are # # So romantic if you likes them Continental # # Go East, young man # # Go West, young man # # But don't go sentimental # # Oh, steer by the North Star # # Look out for the moon # # Oh, sailor, beware, beware # # Beware of your heart # # You know that one night of moonlight # # Can start a typhoon # # Oh, sailor, beware, beware # # Beware of your heart # # Control that emotion # # Whatever you do # # Somebody lies over the ocean # # And she lies right there in wait for you # # Love can't be found # # With a compass or chart # # So be smart, you got to be careful # # So beware and watch your heart # # Steer by the North Star # # Look out for the moon # # Sailor, beware, beware # # Beware of your heart # # One night of moonlight # # Can start a typhoon # # Sailor, beware, beware # # Beware of your heart # # Control that emotion # # Whatever you do # # Somebody lies over the ocean # # Yes she lies in wait for you # # Love can't be found # # With a compass or chart # # So be smart, sailor beware # # Be careful and watch your heart # # Steer by the North Star # # Look out for the moon # # You got to look out, sailor # # Beware, beware, beware of your heart # # You know that one night of moonlight # # Can start a typhoon # # You got to look out, sailor # # Beware, beware, beware of your heart # # Control that emotion # # Whatever you do # # Somebody lies over the ocean # # And she lies in wait for you # # Love can't be found # # With a compass or chart # # So be smart, sailor beware # # Be careful and watch your heart # Uh, it's open. - Ah, food, eh? - Where shall I put it, governor? Uh, wh-where do you usually put it? Most of them have breakfast in bed, governor. Oh, yeah? Well, I guess that's alright too. You don't have to undress, governor. - Oh... oh, no? - No. Oh, well thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. I nearly fell out of this thing last night when we was going around a curve. - Everything alright, governor? - Y... uh... I guess so. How do I look? Boy what a night this has been! What a dawn! What a sunrise! Wha... what are you doing up there? This is where you eat breakfast on the boat. What are you doing, going to bed? No, Doctor, I'm never going to bed on this trip. - Listen, you gotta help me out. - Say, I've got everything all fixed for you. - Is that right? - Here, take this load of crap for me, will you? With pleasure. Wait till you see, wait till you see this. Here you go. Take a look at that. Well, Doc, if a had some clothes and a pair of shoes, I'd be all set. Shoes? Oh, that's easy. You know, a lot of people have been throwing away their shoes. - Throwing away their shoes? - Yeah, the alley out there's full of them. - I'll get you a pair in a minute. - W-wait... That Doc's all right. Here you are, here's a pair. Try these. Won't do, Doc, they're too small. Oh, yeah? Well, then I'll get you some others. Steward! Steward! - What's the matter with you? - Oh, don't mind me, Doc. Well, here you are. You ought to get a pair out of here somewhere. Oh, that's swell. Now, the next thing I gotta do is to think how I'm gonna get you some clothes. Yes, and another thing, we've got to change our cabin. Why, why, I think this is kind of cozy. Yeah, I like that top shelf over there. Well, for one thing, there's a guy on this boat I don't want to run in to. - Who's that? - He's in the opposite cabin. - Who's that? - My boss. You don't say! Is he a sourpuss guy with gray hair and wears nose glasses? That's him. He mustn't see me on this boat. Oh, well look. Uh, maybe if I swipe his glasses, he couldn't see you. Doctor, I don't know what church you belong to, but brother... You's a Christian. Yeah, we men of the cloth have our frivolous moments. Steward! Steward! Take it easy, take it easy. - Uh, go get the glasses. - Yeah, right. Steward! Steward! Oh... was you calling for a steward? I thought I made that clear to everyone on this boat. I, uh... I sent him down to the corner, he'll be back in a minute. Oh, this is a nice little place you got here. If I don't get up on deck for a minute, it won't do me a bit of good. The motion of this boat is beginning to get me. Oh, seasick, huh? Maybe you ought to take off your glasses. I ought to do nothing of the kind. I want to get up and get some air. Oh, you want some air, I'll give you some air. I'll... I'll... Oh... oh, ain't they cute? Parson, I'm in no mood for anything cute. I may need you later, but now I'd rather suffer alone. Well, that's alright. Of course if there's anything you want... why, just let me know, I'm always glad to... What's in this room a flying fish? I don't know, maybe it's a seagull, I... I do all-around Minister work, you know. If there's anything comes up like, uh... a christening, or wedding, or maybe a funeral... Will you get out of here! - Look... well, I got his glasses. - Nice going. - Did you ring, governor? - Certainly I rang! I left some shoes in the corridor and they weren't returned. - I'll look them up, governor. - I want to go up on deck... ...and I can't find my glasses! I'll take you to your deck chair, and when I find your glasses, I'll bring them up to you. Well, Doctor, if you'll excuse me for a jiff, I'll get me some clothes. I hope he brought his gray suit. Oh, that was the easiest thing that ever happened to me. - Hello, Mooney! - Oh, hello, Bonnie! Er... come in, come in! Sorry to disturb you, Doctor, but does James Hill occupy this cabin? Uh... well... not very much. Why, is there something wrong with his tick? Well, I think I'd better warn you, Doctor. We've had a radiogram from Washington. He's Snake Eyes Johnson, public enemy number 1. - No! - Yes. If he comes back, please detain him and uh... ...send the little lady up and let me know that he's here. What a break, they'll grab this guy for Snake Eyes and he'll take the rap. - Yeah, but we mustn't let them, Bonnie. - Why not? I don't know. I... I... I kinda like that fellow. Besides, I think he's got a racket. He stayed out all night. Oh, Mooney, don't be a softy. Here I am, oh... Yeah, and I'm glad you are, look! All set for the trip. You, uh... you remember Bonnie. - Hello, Bonnie - Hello. Yeah, listen, mister... I'm afraid we're in sort of a jam. Tsk-tsk-tsk. My gosh, you'll have to tell your Bishop. Oh, no, no, nothing like that. - Wise him up, Mooney, tell him who we are. Well... look, look... I'm not a clergyman. I'm "Moonface" Martin. I'm a... I'm a crook. I'm wanted an America. What would they want with another crook in America? You don't realize who he is. Moonface is public enemy number 13. Please, Bonnie, we don't have to mention numbers. Now, now, Mooney, you're gonna work up, you got me to help you. When the new list comes out you may be six or seven. Yeah, Washington didn't treat me very fair in that last list. Putting "Rat Nose" Steuben ahead of me. Anyway I don't see why they don't skip thirteen like they do in office buildings. Looks like he must have clipped this off a portiere. - Will you listen to me, please! - Doctor, some other time, not now. Make him listen, Mooney, make him listen. Now, you listen to me or I'll blow the top of your head off. Hey, hey, what have you got there? That's me old pal, put put put. Put put put, well, put put put it away, will you? Stop playing with that thing. I'm your pal. I'm not going to give you away. - But I have to get up on that deck. - That's just what I'm leading up to. That ticket I gave you belonged to public enemy number 1. Public enemy number 1? You mean that punchy-looking fellow on the passport picture? Say, don't you go running down Snake Eyes Johnson. - Snake Eyes Johnson? - Yeah, Snake Eyes Johnson. So you see? We gotta hide you someplace. But I can't hide, I gotta find that girl. She might be in danger right now. Yeah, but the purser is looking for you. - Of course I could kill the purser. - Yeah... no, no, you can't do that! Well, what could they do to me? Well, there has been rumors that they're going to electrocute Snake Eyes. They'll go all through the passengers till they find you. Oh, that'll be a cinch. Wait a minute, Mooney, not so fast.

But may I ask, are you crazy? Yes, a little. About you. Why? Well, you... you pop up in such unexpected places. - Yes, don't I? - And in such strange attire. Why, I think it fits me rather well. Didn't you know it insp... If you're doing it for me, you needn't. Is that nice? You seem to think I'm in danger of some sort. You don't have to tell me unless you feel it's... - Really, I'm perfectly all right, I... - Oh, now, look here, just for saying hello to you tonight I get stuck up with a gun I ask about you on the boat, I get slugged silly. - You can't expect me to believe that... - It's perfectly simple. I ran away from home. You ran away? Yes, and Lord Oakleigh, a friend of the family, is bringing me back. Oh, you mean the long guy with the schnoz. - Schnoz? - Nose. Incredible as it may seem, that's the whole story. - Honest? - On a bride. Well, even if a made a first-class sap out of myself, I'm glad to hear it. Very glad. Look, suppose you drop that disguise and get into some clothes... ...and then we'll do something. - I can't! - Well, why not? - Among other things my boss is on board. - Well, would he mind? - Would he mind? Listen, I'm supposed to be back in New York holding up Wall Street for him. Instead of that, I let everything drop and... followed you. Oh, I am sorry. You have made rather a mess of things, haven't you? Yes, but it's been worth it. Meeting you. Oh. Uh-oh. Oh, there you are. It's jolly facing this morning, isn't it? I've been on the sun deck since nine o'clock. Awfully silly woman up there watching the seagulls fly around. Can you tell, she said, where the seagulls go at night? Seagulls, I said, go to the gallery at night. Do you know, my dear, she... she... ...went off like a flash of lightning in search of the gallery. Very amusing, don't you think? Very amusing. - What? - Yes. - Good morning, Miss Harcourt. - Good morning, Captain. - Lord Oakleigh. - Morning, morning! - Bit of a gale blowing isn't there? - Nothing to speak of, sir. I hope it isn't making you uncomfortable. Oh, we Oakleighs are such bad sailors I hope we have pleasant weather ahead. Yes, indeed, sir. I look forward to a very smooth crossing. Oh, let's hope you're right. Anything I can do to make you comfortable, let me know. # You'll get a moonburn too # # And its mellow... # Hey what are you doing with a bucket, brushing the crowner? - I'm painting the ship. - Well, it seems all right to me. Well, it won't when I get through with it. Oh, that outfit is great. Nobody would ever know you. A little thing I... Well, if you aren't the funniest looking sailor I ever saw. Yes, you're right, it's the perfect disguise. What are you doing, working your way across? Well, you wouldn't help me so my good friend the Doc here offered to... The Doc? Say, wait a minute! Come out from behind that collar, I know you, Moonface. Well, that makes both our disguises perfect. That's Moonface Martin, the slickest conman in the world. No more, no, no more. I ain't a conman no more, I got out of it when the mortgage companies took it over. Say, Billy, how are you getting along with your new girlfriend? Oh, not so hot. There's an Englishman hangs around all the time and watches her. - Can I help you? - You mean you would? Can't stay mad at you. And to prove it I'll take that English accent off your hands. - I think we'd better bump him off. - No, no, no, Doc, no rough stuff. Uh, why yes, madam, you go down three decks, turn to your right and ask for Curly John. - Have you seen him yet, Doctor? - Uh... er... who's that? Why, Snake Eyes Johnson. - Uhhh... Personally, I think he got off the boat. Why, that's impossible. Do you realize how far he'd have to swim? Yeah, that's right, yeah... Ah, but aren't you overlooking the possibility of water winds? Water winds. He may have slipped down to the second or third class. - I'll have them look for him there. - Yeah, he may have slipped down there. Say, what is this Englishman to Billy's girl? - I think they're engaged. - Do you know them? I know him when I hear him. He's got a monocle in his throat. I wonder if that guy's suitable for framing. Just how do you mean? Uh... couldn't you date him up and get him running a temperature? Oh, those Englishmen have awfully high boiling points. You see if, uh... If you could wear something that kinda falls off easy, I could, uh... I could bust in and accuse him of tearing your clothes off, see? Oh, I get it, so that when his girlfriend shows up she'll give him the air, huh? That was the idea. You know, if you weren't a friend of Billy's, I'd unfrock you. Uh... uh... Please, Reno, there's a time and place for everything. Let's go find them. Uh, give me a glass of milk, would you? - What'll you have, daughter? - I'll have the same, please. Hello, Padre. No, I guess you're mistaken. Moon is my moniker. - Moniker? - That's my name. Oh, moniker, yes, moniker. Are you taking your sabbatical abroad? She's not my sabbatical. - No, she's Reno Sweeney. - Oh, the chanteuse. Uh, well, she never went as far as that. Er, Reno... Miss Sweeney, I want you to meet this guy. - How do you do? - Evelyn Oakleigh is my uh... moniker. I'm delighted to meet you, Miss Sweeney. I spent an evening at your nightclub once. It was quite eventful. You affected me so much I turned to the friend I was with and said, look here, why don't we get married in a year or two? You... you certainly... you certainly work fast, don't you? - That's milk! - Yes, yes... I say, can't we get together for cocktails in my cabin before lunch? - Oh, this is too easy. - I beg your pardon? I say, it's too easy to succumb to temptation, I never touch intoxicating liquors myself uh... much. - Well, I'll be glad to come. - Right, then I'll see you at one. Come in. - Did you ring, sir? - Oh, there you are. Bring me a dozen martini cocktails, will you? And, steward, make it snappy. - Yes... make it snappy. - Yes, sir. Come in. Just put it on the bed, will you? - Leave it there. - I beg your pardon? Hello! I say, I thought it was the steward with my cocktails. I'm awfully glad it is you. We've got oodles of time before lunch. Do sit down, will you? I do so want to have a chat with you. Well, I'm glad you feel that way about me because I'm certainly that way about you. - What way? - Oh, that way. Oh, you know I love your American expressions. I'm making a collection of them. Just a minute, will you? To feel that way about a person means to rub his neck. I say, do tell me some others, will you? But you don't understand. I mean you do things to me. - I do things to you? - Evie, that means I like you. Oh, it means you like me, how devastating! Racy language, the American. "You do things to me". - Oh, I give up. - "You do things to me". What's going on here? So, so this is what I find! You beast! You despoiler of innocent girlhood! Look at this poor child! Her clothes torn off by your fiendish attack! Standing there in all her nakedness. - Uh... must be something wrong here. - There's nothing wrong here. Er... well, maybe I'm wrong, wait a minute. What's going on here? Sitting there in your nakedness! Your clothes torn off in a fiendish attack by this innocent girl. - Hey, wait a minute, Moonface! - No, stand back! I will not permit this British lion to twist... er... I will not permit American womanhood to twist the British lion by the tail. And don't think Miss Harcourt won't know about this because I'm going to tell her. Yes, do tell her, and make it thicker, will you? She's always complaining I lack fervor. No... wait a minute, you don't get the idea. And be sure and call me a beast. I rather like that one. - You don't mind, Miss Sweeney, do you? - Now wait a minute! Uh... yeah... wait a minute. You ain't taking the right attitude. You're supposed to get scared. Go on, get scared. This is a serious business! I'm a dangerous man! Oh, come, come, Padre, you're an old dear and you know it. I'll prove to you I'm a desperate character. You mind waiting a minute? Don't go away. I say, do you know what's wrong with the little fellow? Listen, Evie, I really like you. And I'll give you the lowdown. Even if I have to take the rap myself. He was set to bust in here and catch us in a clinch. And you didn't clinch, that's all. You mean he thought I'd make love to you? Well, that was my idea when I came in here. How exciting! Now I guess you realize how serious this is. Hey, what are you trying to pull? Give me that gun! - No. - Give me that... It's all right, Padre. You thought I'd take advantage of Miss Sweeney and you came to her rescue. And I admire you for it. I can't tell you how much I admire you, Padre. You do things to me. Keep away from me or I'll shoot. - Miss Harcourt? - Yes. Thank you. What... - Did you wish anything, miss? - No, I didn't ring. The sailor said your bell was out of order and you called for a steward. - There must be some mistake. - Sorry, Miss. The bathroom tap reported out of order, miss. All right, come in. # My heart and I # # Were discussing your charms # # We decided that you # # Should be in my arms # # My arms and I # # Felt a thrill at the start # # We decided that you # # Should be in my heart # # We're so in love with you # # Both my heart and I # # Love me do # # Then as years go by # # Both my heart and I # # Will forever be true # # For all that I want is your heart # # And you # Could we hear it again?

Yeah, we don... - Billy! - Shh! - That's no good, that outfit won't do. - You're telling me. Listen, Doc, you gotta go down to the cabin and get me a suit of clothes. I can't, there's guards hanging all over the doorknob. I gotta get a suit of clothes somewhere. Hey, there's a suit of clothes. - Only there's a man in it. - I'll investigate. He's asleep. He's got a suit on. And he don't need the suit. Let's take it off! - You watch the stairs, Reno. - Yeah, that's a man's job. Hey, here comes someone. Hey, hey, hey, go on play somewhere else, scat! My aunt says I can play anywhere on this boat I want. Well, you go get your aunt and play with her. Here, tell her that you won this. Come on, come on, let's get busy, see? Let's get busy... Ahhh! Hey, hey, sonny. Wait just a minute. - Do you like to do that? - Sure. I like to stick them and see them jump. You do, huh? Would you like to do it again? - No, no, no more, I can't take it. - Not you... come here. Well, we got it. Really, Mr. Whitney, you can't go around like this. What? I beg your pardon. Well, how do you like that? Of all the people on this boat and we gotta steal my boss's pants. You should have gotten his coat too. Yeah, but even if he had a coat, he'd still need a beard. - What goes on here? - We're looking for a beard. Yeah. There's a beard. Bonnie, go down to the barber shop and borrow a pair of clippers. Doc, I admire how your mind works, but you can't get away with that. Billy, the kid's got a cute thought. Let's dwell on it. Here's your hat and coat. - Oh, he fell down! - It's okay, boys. Yeah, it's alright. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute! Thanks. Hey... wait till he lights. Oh! A-boo! I got it. Pick a fight, you know. Oh, hello. You can't say that to me and get away with that! You take off your coat and we'll fight it out right here. - What's the matter with him? - Oh, go ahead, knock his block off. I wouldn't take that from anybody. I'll hold your coat. - You wanna fight? - Yeah! All right, I apologize. - I guess it won't work now. - Who said I won't work? My wife told you to say that. It's a lie. - You can't say that to me! - Ahhh! # I get a kick out of this # # Ohh # Well, here's a pair of pants and a tie. Yes, ma'am, a coat and a hat. - Well, I guess this fixes me up. - Hm-hmm. Yeah, but you still... Look, you still gotta have something to cover that face. - Gee wiz, if I only had a beard. - Yeah, if you only had a beard. If he only had a beard. - That's all the man has. - Very nice too. Look, look, listen. # We'll get a clip out of you # Oh, how do you do, sister? - How do you do? - Could we have a little conversation together? - Yes, indeed, Doctor. - Won't you sit down? Thank you. You know, I've seen you aboard. And I seemed so eager to make your acquaintance. - Is that so, well. - Yes, indeed. - We've a lot to talk about. - You don't say! Well, what about? You see, I'm honorary president of the Texas ??? League. Well, I prefer the Nationals myself... uh... you don't say? Yes, I'm an ardent fighter for reform in the schools. Oh, then I'm your man. We forget only too quickly what we learned at reform schools. Why, Doctor, are you interested in prison reform? Oh, yes ind... of course... Yes indeed! Surely you don't approve of capital punishment. What was good enough for my father is good enough for me. Uh... uh... I'll never forget what a judge once said to me. He sa... we'll skip that sentence. What do you think of the Detroit Tigers? The Detroit Tigers? I knew a family in Detroit by the name of Lions. Lions? Well, I know Max Baer, but he was from San Francisco. I don't think I understood just what you said. That's alright... you wasn't listening. Doctor, I've enjoyed this little chat very much. - I'm glad somebody has. - I hope I'll see you again sometime. - I'm afraid so. - I'm sure I do. Goodbye... good... Now that's what I call "Puttin' on the Dogz". Well, to tell the truth, I feel like a dog. - What do you mean? - Reno, you're really a pet. You asked me to sail with you and I say no. I fall for another girl and you still help me.

Oh, Dr. Moon, we were just beginning a search for you. I'm afraid we have some bad news for you. Well... I was afraid we wouldn't get away with it. - It's about your pupils. - Why, what's the matter with my pupils? I mean, your Chinese pupils. My Ch... my... oh, ohh... Oh, them. We don't allow gambling in the third class. You must make them understand or we'll have to lock them up. I've sent for them and I'm going to turn them over to you. Now look here, now, I've got enough troubles as it is... ...without your ringing in a couple of Chinese on me. But you must talk to them, Doctor. After all, you're responsible for them. Everytime we speak to them they tell us to see the Bishop. Oh... Oh... the Bishop, huh? Here they are, sir. Come on, get in here. Maybe I said something. Uh, do you mind? I think I'd better talk to these boys alone. All right, I'll leave them here with you for a while, Doctor. Shut the door. Er... what can I do for you boys? Where's the Bishop? The Bishop ain't here right now. Is there anything I can do? - Shipman take away cards. - Oh, you've been gambling, huh? Well, don't you know good Christians never gamble? Not only is it sinful but if you don't know how to deal from the bottom, you lose all your money. Oh, we no lose, we win. - Three hundred dollars. - Yes, three hundred dollars. Uh... you got three hundred dollars! Uh... There's a little game I'd like to show you. Get down there on the floor. Now look. I've got fifty dollars, see? I put up my 50 and you put up your 300. I throw a number and if I throw the same number before I throw a seven, I win. If I don't, you win, you understand it? Oh, money from home. Here it is. Beat me! Get your... Here, here, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute! - Boxcar! - Craps, you lose! Well, I didn't say anything about that. - Oh, we know about that. - Yeah, I can see that you do. Well, we'll try it again. Look, you put your money on the floor... ...and I'll put mine on the cuff, see? And we'll... And make them better men. Although they're pretty good already. - I think they'll be alright now. - Thank you, Doctor, for your help. That's alright, just part of the daily routine. - Take them along. - Yes, sir. Oh, dinner, huh? No, that's the trap-shooting contest on the upper deck. Now look here, if there's going to be any more crap shooting on this boat, I won't play unless you bar those Chinese. Oh, no, Doctor. Trap-shooting contest. You know, you shoot at clay pigeons with guns. - What do you shoot for? - Well, the first prize is fifty dollars. Oh... can I use my own gun? Why, certainly, Doctor. It starts in fifteen minutes. You'll excuse me? Hm... even-steven. Pull! - Thank you, steward. - Excellent score, sir. Yes, of course! Here you are, sir. Pull! I say, twenty-four out of twenty-five, not bad, what? Splendid, Evie, and you ought to win. # My heart and I # # Will forever be true # # For all that I want # # Is your heart and you # Well, for my goodness alive sake! - Is this not Miss Haircut? - Harcourt. Hope Harcourt. This is Sir Evelyn Oakleigh. Se?or Arturo del Arte?o d'El Greco. - How do you do, won't you sit down? - Gracias! I was told I should introduce myself to you... ...by my dear, dear cousin the Duke Vintfrancs et Dix. The Duke of Vingtfrancs et Dix. Oh, I must have met him in Paris. Oh, the French. They have been so kind to my poor family since the revolution. Yes, you have to take your hat off to the French. You must have to take your shirt off to the French. I say! Gun, sir? - What's the matter with you? - I say, old boy, are you ill? There's something wrong with this man, Evie, I know. Yes, nervous or something, I think, I don't know. Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the trap-shooting contest is the Reverend Dr. Moon! Excuse me, no? You see, I'm a little shell-shocked. When the revolution she is coming to my beloved country... - You see? - I'm so sorry you aren't feeling well. I'd love to hear that delightful tune you just sang. Oh, to sing for mademoiselle I would gladly leave a very sick bed, is it not? - No it isn't! - Oh... Gracias. # My heart and I # # Were discussing your charms # # We decided that you # # Should be in my arms # # My arms and I # # Felt such a thrill at the start # # We decided that you # # Should be in my heart # # We're so in love with you # # Both my heart and I # # Love me... me do # # And then as years go... # I say, dogs do take to you, don't they? # Both my heart and I # # Will forever be true # # For all that I want # # Is your heart and you # This big fellow, he thinks he's lap dog. - Hello! - How are you, Mr. Johnson? Captain, here's our man. - Who do you think I am? - I know who you are You're Snake Eyes Johnson, public enemy number 1. Hands up! One false move and I'll shoot. Disarm that man. Bonnie, grab the fiddle. - There, don't get tough now! - Let me have that gun! - Dr. Moon, what's the meaning of this? - I'm no Doctor, I'm... He's Moonface Martin, public enemy number 13. Bonnie, how many times have I asked you not to mention numbers? - And who are you? - I'm Mrs. Snake Eyes Johnson. - Come on, Evie, let's go. - Wait a minute, I'm no public enemy. My name is Crocker, William Crocker. - Never talk, never talk! - Take them away. Wait a minute, Captain, You're making a big mistake. I can prove who I am. Here's Mr. Whitney. Mr. Whitney's my boss. He'll tell you who I am. Do you know that man? I never saw him before! They're over there in the Royal Suite. - Hello, Reno. - Are you going to spring us? Well, I've been to the Captain, I told them all who you are but they won't believe me. - Have you seen her? - She's hiding in her cabin. - She won't see anybody. - Well, you've got to see her and explain. Gee, Reno, you don't know what this means to me. I've worked on your boss too, but no luck. He's sore, he says this will teach you a lesson. He would. I've tried to reason with Sir Oakleigh but he thinks I'm your gun moll. Yeah, well now, don't worry, we'll beat the rap somehow. We probably will, but by that time she'll be married or... or something. Well, you still got me. She may be prettier than I am but she can't like you any more. So, with Reno and me... # You're the top # # You're the Swanee River # # You're the top # # You're a goose's liver # # By a girly side # # You're the envy of every man # # You're a Russian ballet # # You're Rudy Vallee # # You're celophane # She must be disgusted with me. # You're much more # # You're a field of clover # # I'm the floor # # When the ball is over # Don't worry, Billy, you'll see her all right. Yeah, yeah, but when? Whe she's somebody else's wife. Alright, miss, your time is up. Your landing card, what? - Thanks. - No more Americans, what? - No more Americans. - Mrs. Ronald McFeil, what? Quite. That's right. Pick you up in about ten minutes. He... Hello. Not a very warm reception, Evie. My dear Reno, if you still persist... I say, what are you doing with all those things on your head? Oh, never mind about that, I've just seen the captain and it's no use. You're the only one left who can help Billy. He's so much in love with Miss Harcourt. So you see, even if I didn't believe... ...Billy was a public enemy, it's too late now, anyway. - Not if we work fast. - Oh, I'm no sap! I know who he is, I know who you are too, you're a gunman's moll, that's who you are. Why, the very first time you met me... ...you tried to play the badger game on me, you said so yourself. But that was only to give Billy a chance. Oh, and who is this Billy? The American government says he's a public enemy... ...and you say he's not. Who am I to believe, you or your uncle? - Uncle? - Samuel or whatever the fellow's name is. He's run for the government, the whole thing, you know the fellow I mean. Oh, I can't get to Miss Harcourt, the captain won't believe me and you won't believe me. - I guess I'd better give up. - Why don't you reform? If you'd only change your ways, I could go for you. Dash it all, I'm that way about you! - You mean you're in love with me? - Terrifically! Well, I get a kick out of you too. It's no use, I can't be expected to marry a gunman's moll. Why, the honor of the family comes into it. We all have our honor, haven't we? You certainly can ask the most embarrassing questions. 48, 49, 50, 51... Oh... Merry old England. Imagine five days in this joint, it's a wonder I haven't gone nuts. Well, this ain't so bad. Was you ever in jail in Cicero? I don't mean the new one, I mean the old one. Listen, Doc, will you lay off those travel lectures, I'm sick of them. You know, I've been in a lot of tough hoosegows in my life. But in Splitlip, Nevada, they got the cutest little chair you ever saw. You wanna do me a favor, Doc, just keep quiet. Alright, I was just trying to keep your mind on something cheerful. I know you were thinking about her. I know, Doc, you've really been pretty swell. Will you stop worrying? Do me a favor, you'll hear from her. She's landing today, I'll never see her again.
