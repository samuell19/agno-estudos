My name is Ramya Gowarikar Assistant commissioner of police! I spent my life catching criminals. I am not the one to let go people who commit a crime, go scot-free. I have mercilessly killed many criminals. But there was a person who made me hesitant about shooting him. I knew that he was a criminal. But I didn't feel like killing him. My police brain kept telling me to kill him. But my heart said no. I didn't feel like pressing the trigger. I came across a criminal in Goa. He was kid. He is almost around 25 year old. I want to tell about his love story. There is a story behind this bloodshed. It is a story of love. And he was afraid of love. But he loves that girl. He loves her so much that he was even willing to die for her! His name is Vasco De Gama. This is the third case. Do you know what happens when it gets to the third case? They are going to open career criminal charges against you. Your father was such a well-respected man. And you turned out this way? Put an end to smuggling and other illegal activities, and live a respectable life. If not, I am going to proceed with career criminal charges against you! What is it? Should I proceed or not? File career criminal charges against me. Are you going to be a thug now? That is how I grew up and I keep hanging out with thugs too. You! I am going to break your teeth! I will help you become a police constable. Get your act together and be assiduous. Sir, a constable earns a meagre 20,000 rupees a month. How is that enough? Taking care of mother, father, wife and children, and their education costs... Why don't you tell me? The monthly fuel allowance for vehicles at each of the police stations doesn't even last a week. So, what do you do? You take it out on the people. Don't you need to squeeze the public for money to fund your meals and refreshments? Sir, the police department itself gives its employees an excuse for wrong-doing. Instead of pilfering here, I would rather go out there and plunder. What are you going to do? I don't know what I'm going to do... ...but I do know that it will be big. I have great respect for your father. That is the only reason that you are being spared. Sir, the respect you have for my father doesn't concern me. If you want to do me a favor now, file those career criminal charges against me. At least that way, I will get some notoriety. You there! Get me the board! You've been warned. Beyond that, it's your decision. Take the photo! Take it! Sir, all my life, this is what I worked hard for. My career is just beginning to take off. Please give me a hug. Sir, I am being sincere. Please give me a hug. Get lost! Hey! Take him away! Get moving! I shall take my leave, sir. When I see you again, tell me that you've changed. Annie! Hey, Vasco! I got cycle. Let's go. Looking at her, people assume that she is his girlfriend. But, that's not the case. She is his close friend. Her name is Annie. Did they let you go now? -Yes. Grandma... I am back! Are you angry? What did the police say? What can they say? They apologized and said that they would never arrest me again. The police department signed a very lengthy apology letter and stamped it. Really? Yes. Show me the letter. Show it. Give it. Here, take it. -Why is it so small? That's a xerox, grandma. That's how it is. Grandson, you must live well. You must earn well. And share that money amongst all of our dear ones. That is all. Next Sunday.... Next Sunday, you are going to distribute the money. That's for sure. That's all. Really? -You are super! Super! Did you speak to Jesus? Yes. Come, let's go and meet Jesus. There are a lot of gangs and illegal businesses operating in Goa. Not just Indians. There are British, French, Italian, Israelis and Russian mafia in Goa. Kaya and Samsung, they are bothers. They operate from Anjuna, Vagator and Chapora coastline. This is the stuff we've been planning for, past two years. This is my dream. I am investing my entire life on this. When it comes here, cooperate with me. I will give you whatever you want. When the stuff arrives, the ground here must be cleared. We mustn't have any enemies. Especially that Rodriguez... Watch it! Watch it! Hey! Get up! Hey, get lost. Hey, remove the bike. Vasco! If you show me that, I will show you something else. What is your name? What is your name? What do you do? What do you do? I do anything for money. I am the same. Do you want work? Are you offering? I will give you ten percent for delivery... ...ten percent. Let's go. Get in the car. I'll take my bike. His name is Rodriguez. He picks up teen boys such as Vasco and employ them in his business. He has Calangute, Baga, Arpora areas in his control. They've tied up our boy there because he sold our stuff in their area. Go and get him. What's his name? Chiko. Chiko? Could that be Chiko? It must be him. Let's change the attitude. Chiko! After many days, found you at last! What is it? How dare you sell stuff in our area? You scoundrel! Vasco! Stop! Stop it, Vasco! Hey! Who the hell are you?! How many times do I have to tell you not to come to our neighborhood? Somebody, please tell him to stop. This is our area, Idiot! Who the hell are you?! -Gun! Gun! Gun! Gun! Give me something. I am going to kill this scumbag! You! Who the hell are you? I am your mother's husband! Your father! Super! You were brilliant! What's your name, bro? Vasco De Gama. Welcome to our new gang member. This is our gang and he is Marco. Hi. Santa, our engineer. Rosario, our PRO. And boys, finally we have a girl in our gang. Annie De Cruz. Hi. Fully organic and eco-friendly. She is not eco-friendly. She is as dangerous as a north Korean missile. I like her. Even then, I will not let you do anything. Girls who claim that they will not let you do anything to them... ...tempt you into doing something to them. This weighs 50 kgs. You must deliver it to South Goa. Don't take your bike. The scrutiny is intense at the check post. I will take care of it. It will be done. I am letting you handle 50 kgs of product. If something goes wrong, I will kill you. I am not the kind to get things wrong. Why should I trust you? You already trust me, brother. That's why you gave me such a big deal. Well, forget about these 50 kgs and 100 kgs. Look for something bigger. I need a lot of money. What for? For Mary Foundation. Where is that? It isn't established yet. If you give me money, I will register. Do you know who Mary is? She is my grandmother. My grandmother and I wish to build a lot of houses. I am having fun. You freaked me. Hi! Hello! John? Bye. I need to go. My fans are waiting, you know? Yeah, right! Your fans?! Excuse me, Mr. John. Do you even realize, that your wife is a celebrity? Just open my FaceBook page. You will see of guys proposing marriage to me. Tell those idiots to get married to you. They are going to be ruined. Never mind, tell me when you are going to be done with your program. I will come and pick you up. Probably another three hours. Are they really going to watch for three hours? It's too little, right? Alright, fine. Finish your program fast. I need to go all the way to South Goa... with you for company. It's Mr. John's family. They are from South Goa. -Monica! Come, darling. Hi, ma'am. Hi. I am a big fan of you. Really? -Yes, ma'am. Thank you. -I just love your songs. Thank you so much. What's your favorite song? All the songs, ma'am. Oh, thank you, dear. Thank you so much. So sweet of you. Nice curls, by the way. One second, huh? Monica? Monica, come here. She is Monica. Hi. -She is Annie.

But, one request. What? -You must wear a dazzling dress. Remember, the last time you wore a red dress? It was awesome. Do the fans really notice such details? Yes. I am going to be frank and ask you a question... You must answer me honestly. Tell me. The young men...are they more interested in me or in Monica? You.... If Cathy is in front of us, who will pay attention to Katrina or Kareena? For fans such as me, besides you, we don't notice anyone else. Hey! Call me at times. It feels nice to talk to you. It feels so good. For sure. See you tonight. See you tonight. Thank you. Bye. To transport these forty kilos of product, we need to organize a show every night.

Here? What are you doing here? I am trying to get her. She said she would be back. Trying to get her? Vasco, with regards this girl, you are getting yourself worked up a lot. I never saw you like this. If you provoke a woman, you are going to be ruined, buddy. I am going to explain something clearly. Listen. An animal came to meet another animal. The both of these animals are getting seduced by each other. That's all. There is nothing more to it. If that's the case, fine. I am worried that those animals might fall in love. Foolish girl! Only people fall in love. Why would animals fall in love?! John? Come here, dear. -What is it? What? Right there in the shadows... two people sitting in the bushes... I feel like there are two people sitting in the bushes. What is your opinion on it? Hey! Who is there? Who is there?! Let's go! Let's go! They must be burglars, john. Not burglars. They must be your fans. You don't even know who you are blowing kisses to. They must have come to get kisses from you in person. Is that so? Hello? Customs office? Yes. Sir, I have a secret information for you. There is a cargo ship that's arriving from Germany. Please check all the containers. You will find some precious product in it. When will that ship arrive? Today evening. Samsung and Kaya are going to be finished. You are merely focusing on messing with them. Why don't you think of stealing that precious cargo? What? If we plan well, we can steal that container for ourselves. How are we going to steal the container? I've already called the police and informed them. Ship is on the way and the police are waiting at the port. What can we do now? If you give me ten percent of the cargo, I will tell you the plan. You work for me. Tell me the idea. Will you give me ten percent? How much did you think that the cargo was worth? It's huge. That is why I asked for ten percent. I picked you up from the streets and gave you work. You demand money from me? Twenty percent! Now, it's thirty percent! Tell me the idea! Tell me the idea! I don't have a plan, brother. I was just kidding. It was in jest. I know that you have an idea. Tell me. Brother, that's not true. I was just joking. It was meant to be fun. It's true, brother. Please believe me. Get out! Give me back my gun. Get up! Here, take it. You both are out of my gang. Get out. Come on, let's go. Gang we thought we would work together but that's not possible now. See you all. Miss you. Peace out. Why did you get into a fight with him? When was I in a fight with him? I was trying to make a deal. He was the one who picked the fight. They threw us out of their gang. What are we going to do now? Let's establish a company. Assume, we already did. You are the CEO. Me? -Yeah. -CEO? -Yeah. Take care. I miss you. Where is she going? Let's go. Bye, Cathy. -See you. Cathy! Cathy! Hey! Hi, sweetheart. How are you? Where is Monica going? Mumbai, my dear. Why is she going to Mumbai? For higher studies. When is she coming back? She isn't. She isn't coming back. She won't come. -What do you mean she won't come back?! I mean, she isn't going to be back for a year. From now on, I am solo. There is no competition. Call me when you are free. I mean for the, you know, programs. Bye. Bye. What's this? She left without meeting me. Let's go! Brother! Stop the vehicle! Stop it! Get down! There she is! I heard you're leaving. You can catch the next bus. Come. What now? You can leave after an hour. Hey, there! Are you getting on the bus or are you taking the girl with you? One minute. Excuse me. If you don't mind, go back, please. What do you want? Let's do this. I will come with you to Mumbai. I will spend the night there and come back in the morning. What do you say? What for? Do you have something to say to me?! This isn't about talking I am going to stay the night there and... I will come back in the morning. You seem like a pervert. First, get down from the bus! First, get down from the bus! Get down, please. Get down, please. Get down. Get down, first. -I don't think you understand. Right... Right. Damn! Come... Come. Stupid fellow! The ship is going to be here in two hours. My brain isn't working. Tell me what's your idea. I established a company of my own. You are now talking to a boss. I will tell you the idea. Let's split the cargo equally amongst both of us. If not, the entire cargo is going to be taken away by the police. Okay. Tell me. Do you have a man on the ship? Just one. How many boxes are there in the container? There are a lot of them. Call your man. Tell him to open the container and take four boxes out of the said container and place them in another container. Now, find out the number of that container from him. CRSU 147670 Hello? Sir, Listen. There is a ship coming from Germany. One of its containers has narcotics. Write down the number of that container. Tell me. Who are you? Well-wisher. To check all the containers on that ship, it would take them four days. Now, I gave them the container's number. The officers at the customs are going to open those four boxes. and list them as recovered narcotics. They won't check the others. If we nab the actual container... ...it will be checkmate. On the basis of information provided by an unidentified man, the customs officers have raided a cargo ship arriving from Germany. The custom officers have found four boxes in a container... that contains a lot of smuggled narcotics... They said there were only four boxes, brother! What about the rest of the goods? The police must have stolen them. No doubt! Even though I'm living in India, if I close my eyes for a moment or even turn my head or by mistake if I bend.... There are idiots here who would stuff an Impala car in every little space they can find. We are ruined! Money! Money! Money! Brother! A vehicle has arrived from Mary foundation. If you get up, I will take half of it. Shall I tell you something honestly? I never expected it to be worth this much. I knew how you would have reacted if I asked for 50 percent. I don't want 50%. Let's go with what we discussed before. Give me ten percent. I'll take it and leave. Ten percent is way too much for such a small idea. Are you sad, brother? You can't find it in your heart to share? Even though I gave you a discount, you are still dissatisfied? When everyone told me that you were an idiot, I didn't believe them. Yes, I am an idiot. All this is mine. Rodriguez, you are going back on your word. Even if I was a man of my word, do you think I would give you ten percent? You! Does anyone else want a share? No! We don't want it. From today onwards, I am your boss Alright? Okay, you are my boss. Does anyone else want a share? You killed him? Are you going to kill us all? I am telling you this right now. Half of this is mine. The other half is yours. Stop! Consciously or otherwise, we've gotten lucky by hitting such a huge jackpot. If Samsung gets to know about this, he is going to kill all of us. So, prepare for that and take your share with you. Okay? Okay. Our boss Rodriguez took a huge load with him and ran away somewhere. Everyone must stick to this story. Okay? We will repeat the same story. We will all say the same thing. Amen. Rodriguez has been absconding since yesterday...since yesterday! Where? Where is the product? Tell me. I don't know, Mr. Samsung. Let me go, please. The three of you must have done something. You gave him the product. Didn't you? Where did he go?! Who the hell are you? I am asking you. Who the hell are you? Sit down, sir. Let's sit down and talk. Who the hell are you? I am asking you. My name is Vasco De Gama. Vasco De Gama alberto Inspector Badani Sir... Twelve years ago, an incident happened here. There was a sincere police officer in the department. You were the head constable then. Do you remember? Looks like I am going to be late coming home today as well. You head off... Alright, fine. Have your meal. Badani. -Sir. Go and check the truck. Sir, they said they wanted to speak to you. What is it about? Namaste, sir. -What's in the vehicle? Come, sir. Let us sit and talk. -What's in the vehicle?! How much do you want, sir? You dare offer me a bribe?! Sir, let's talk about it. What do you think of me? Sir...sir...sir... Don't do anything to him. I will talk to him. Sir, these people are offering us some stuff. Let's just let the vehicle go. We will take care of it later, sir. Let's end this, sir. Dear! Alexander. I am Alexander's son. She was the daughter of a homeguard who died in the incident. Annie! To nurture me, my grandma went through a lot of hardships. We didn't have food to eat... ...and sheltered ourselves in a house with crumbling walls. No one helped us. No department looked after us. That is why we have joined the crime department. Our boss Rodriguez is absconding. Right now, I am the one who is maintaining the gang. It would be better if we come to an understanding. I am not an outsider, sir. We are all from the same department. Mary Foundation this is our foundation. If you turn a blind eye to our vehicles, that's enough. You will be happy and so will I.

As soon as it gets dark, I get scared. It's already late. -Leave me. Leave me. Cathy! -Cathy? Cathy! Up until then, everything was fine. But one of the members of Vasco's gang drank way too much and blabbered the truth. Vasco encountered new problems that needed to be dealt with. It wasn't Rodriguez? What are you saying? These little kids have stolen all of our stuff. The entire container worth of product. Imagine the money they would have earned?! Just imagining it....imagining it is .... grating on my nerves! Our stuff is still with them? Did they sell it? If it still exists, where did they put it? Catch someone from that gang and get him here. Drag that Idiot! -Who the hell are you?! Who are you? Why did you go alone? To have intercourse? What if they killed you there? No. I love you! I love you! How many girls are you going to confess your love to? Will you forget that girl or not? -I will forget about her. Will you forget her or not?! -I will forget about her. Hey, I like Monica a lot. I am very serious about Monica. I am not saying no to the girl. I am just saying no to loving her. Forget about girls and forget about love! Forget about the entire species of women! How is that possible? We do have certain weaknesses. All you men are just rogues! Yes, we are rogues. And, we are rouges for women. If you closely examine the percentage of rouges, men and women make up equal percentages. Tell me! -I don't know. What did you guys do with my product? Tell me. -I don't know, fool! Is that so? Spill it! You don't know? You don't, huh? He is a very good guy. He always had a smile on his face. He's always liked you a lot. You should have called me and told me that you needed money. Why did you call Samsung? What? What do you mean I called Samsung? Who told you that? What are you talking about? You are suspecting me?! Do you think I have no spine? I am not the one who is greedy for money. Sir... Neither am I Buddha, nor are you Jesus Christ. We are all scoundrels. Perhaps, you are. Not me. -Your constable told us that you made the call. Samsung... Vasco's man took the load and left. I will tell you the vehicle number. How much will you give me? Who is that? You mean to say you believed this nonsense from someone? Am I important, or is he? What are you thinking? I was thinking if I should kill a policeman or not. What? You are going to kill me? You are going to kill me? That's not it, sir. Some people in the department support us and some don't. Mary Foundation is right in the middle of things. At this point in time, I was wondering if killing a policeman is the right thing to do or not. I made a mistake. I am begging you. If someone catches me by my throat, I might believe them. But, I never believe anyone who begs me on their knees. Don't be like that. I know that you are sad. I will fix a drink for myself and be back. Vasco was right. Doesn't matter if the police man was corrupt. Either ways, if a policeman is killed, the Police department doesn't stay quiet. That is the reason why I was posted in Goa. My name is Ramya Gowarikar. Assistant Commissioner of Police. Since I joined the duty, I fired 482 bullets just on the body. Two of those bullets were used to fire two policemen. One to the chest. One at the back. If they commit a crime, I don't spare a policeman either. ACP Ramya Gowarikar. Special officer. I looked into her. I found out that she is really crazy. Apparently, she was intensely scouted just to deal with us. From now on, the police department isn't going to support us. That ACP has even changed the staff at the Check Post. We must plan something new that does away with the need to go through Check Post. Engineer, let's go. Taking an inspiration from a small mice, The idea of a tunnel came to Vasco's mind. This isn't a new idea. Many years ago, Chicago's Al Capone and Mexico's El Chapo dug tunnels such as this. It was a great blessing to the police department that such a tunnel came into existence in Goa. It's not so easy to dig a tunnel that is 6 ft tall and that runs for a kilometer. Electrical wiring, Oxygen Supply are very necessary. Vasco De Gama! Vasco De Gama is the issue. He killed Badani. I want him. Where are his records? There are no records of him, madam. We never saw him. You do know his name, right? Go and catch him. Vasco De Gama is a common name, madam. In each street, one can find someone or another with that name. Well, even the Goa's railway station is named after â€˜Vasco De Gama'. I mean... just like Sreenu is a common name, so is Vasco De Gama. What can the heart do when it falls in love with someone else. (Singing Song) Don't know when someone... (Singing Song) Why did you stop singing, dear? Sing... On the heights of.... This....there is a movie called Satte Pe Satta starring Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini. What's that song in that movie? I can't recall. Hold on! Hold on! Yes! I remember it now. My dear sweetheart, until when will you... (singing) Hey! What do you want?! There is a secret cave at the beach, right? Let's go there. Friday. I can't wait until Friday. -Friday! Monica! There was song sung by Ranbir Kapoor in the movie Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. What is it? You are my journey... Yes, you are my destination. Everyday that goes by without you... Oh, this difficult heart! You are my divinity...Again. You are my divinity.. Everyday that goes by without you.. Oh, this difficult heart! Oh, this difficult heart!.. Don't leave any vehicle out. Check each of them thoroughly. What is your name? Alberto. Remove your Helmet. Idiot, if he gets caught... License? Ma'am, do you recall me? I came to your office. My father is a sub-inspector. Which station? Candolim Station. Can you give me an autograph? I am a fan. I am not a film star. You can go. License? That scoundrel Vasco slipped out of our fingers, brother. He escaped from the Check Post. The fortune is not in favor of us right now. Even the parrot says the same thing. Oh god! Why do you keep harping on that parrot?! I don't believe in all these things. But, all of its predictions thus far have been correct. I am telling you this. So, listen! I am going to kill him today. And then, return home. The parrot says no! Come back. Kaya! Someone is calling you. Check who it is. He! He is the one! Why is there are gunshot sound? You said that Vasco De Game is a common name. You said you didn't see him ever. Are you the one who took this photo? Yes, madam. Even after taking the photo, why didn't you start career criminal charges against him? His father's name is Alexander. He was from our Police Department. He was a very sincere officer. A pity, he was killed. At first, when he started to go astray, I changed the charges. I was worried that his life might be ruined. That is why I didn't record career criminal charges against him. Now, he works as an event manager. And he is behaving himself. He is very close to my family. At times, he calls my wife and talks to her. Yesterday, at the Check Post, he gave me a false name. He showed me a wrong ID. He spoke as if his father was still alive. How do I believe him? Where is your wife? This stupid string! Namaste, Madam. I've heard a lot about you. My husband constantly talks about you. Call Vasco. -What, madam? Call Vasco and find out where he is. Why, madam? Are you planning an event? Yes. A recording dance. Recording dance? Very interesting. I'll call him. He isn't picking up, ma'am. Where is Monica? Oh? I mean, you are mistaken.

But, we don't know if he really loves her or not. Let's see. Today's shootout at Arambol Beach left many causalities. Police are in prey to catch those gangsters behind it. I cannot believe that he is such a big gangster. By the time we went there, he escaped. -Not that, John... what I don't know is... Without my knowledge, when did these two meet? What's with all these arrangements? Where is Monica? Madam is interrogating her. I'll call you back. So, you don't know that he is a gangster? No, I don't. Do you know where he lives? No, I don't. Are you in love with him? I don't know. Are you a kid? Anything I ask, your answer is always no! Did you go with him without knowing anything? Tell me. How long has this affair been going on? We haven't started an affair yet. Today is the first day. What have you been doing all these days? He used to hold me here and there. That's all. Nothing beyond that. Where did he hold you? Once at the beach. After that, he came home and held me twice. And today, he held me. Can you please explain what you mean by â€˜holding you'? Does it mean kissing, hugging or holding your hand and pulling you towards him? All of these together mean â€˜holding'. What did you do after that? We spoke. What did he tell you? I am the one spoke many things. What did you tell him? I spoke to him about longing, lust and deep friendship. So, you are the one who spoke? Yes. What was he doing when you were speaking to him? He continued to fondle me. Listen, tell me something. Are you trying to flirt with him or is he trying flirt with you? He started it first. After that, I initiated it. Madam? -Come in! What is it? Madam. If you are done, I will take Monica home. I am not sending her. She is innocent, madam. What? She is innocent? Talking to her, I am unable to figure out if she is innocent or I am! She is my sister, madam. Your sister has been going around with him! Your sister is his sweetheart. And all of you together with him are up to some ridiculous nonsense! First, you should be put in jail. Get out of here! Get out! Vasco! Where is Monica? Monica, listen to me! Stop! Monica! Why didn't you tell me?! Did you tell me where you live and what you do in Mumbai? Since I didn't ask about this, you didn't tell me. And you didn't ask about things, so I didn't tell you either. Where are you taking me? I am going to drop you. After that? After that, I am going to go. Where are you going to go? Just going to go. Are you going to meet me again? I know that you wouldn't want to see my face. Why wouldn't I want to see your face again? I liked you because of your face. I came with you because I like your face. Why would I care if you are some gangster or a rouge? If you want to meet me again, meet me. I am not the girl who gets scared. Just as you, even I can jump over the wall. You are wanted by the Police Department and even by me. Now, go away from here. Monica? Come here. Monica? Monica? Monica! Stop! Monica! Stop! What were you guys doing?! You should have shot that Idiot! Monica! When he came here and took her with him, what were you guys doing?! He came and took me. But that wasn't my plan. I returned because I thought you might misunderstand me. Even he doesn't know why he took me away from here and brought me here. I thought he would make me elope with him. He dropped me home and went away. John, take your sister home. Did he get this angry just 'cause Monica was remanded in the station for a night?

My business is to kill you! Brother, lift my boss Rodriguez's photo up. Remove the photo frame. With a click of a single button, I can get rid of you. But I wouldn't do that. Please take me seriously. Don't get on my nerves. Do you want me to press the button? Hey, run! Catch him! Hey! Why are you tearing up the posters? Run, fellas! Run! Come here. Now, tell me. Why did you tear the posters? We are very well acquainted with his grandmother. She is the one who built our house and school for us. What's her name? Mary. Where does this good Samaritan Mary live? Mary Foundation. Is this Mary Foundation or Mary Printing press? Foundation, madam. How did you get all this? -Crowd Funding, madam. Mary madam gave it to us. Where is Mary? Ever since you put up posters of Mary's grandson, they haven't been living for long at any place. They've been wandering. Seize everything. No, madam. Please, madam. If you take all this way, the construction on our houses will be stopped. Please, madam. No, don't. What do you mean houses? What do you mean houses? Tell me! I wasn't in the right mind, madam. I just spoke some nonsense. Please let it go. Up until now, we've changed fifteen houses. How long are we going to wander about without a proper home, dear? First, get married immediately. The entire police department is already on it. Ramya....she is someone who is seriously working on it. One fine day, she is going to get me married. Anyways, why are these police interfering in our personal lives? I am quite irritated. Hello? Stop the construction that's been going on for Mary Foudation. From tomorrow onwards, you are no longer to work here. John! - Madam? Send all these laborers away. We are not laborers, madam. These houses belong to us. We are working hard to build these houses for ourselves. Whenever it rains, we are scared that the roof might fall on us and some of us are sure to die. We are constantly living in this fear. We don't have mansions and bungalows like you do. We are poor people who live in huts. All of a sudden, how did such poor people get such a lot of money? Where is Vasco De Gama? Do you or do you not know who Vasco De Gama is? Do you or do you not know who Vasco De Gama is?! We know who he is, madam. We do. He is Alexander's son. Ten years ago, when there was a cyclone and my house collapsed, my husband died. I was left with two...two young children. I didn't give birth to Vasco De Gama. And at that time, he couldn't have been more than ten years old. I was in utter despair because my house collapsed, when he told me this: â€œMother, someday we will build houses of our own.â€ Why do I care where he gets the money from? All we care about is that he supported us. He is our child. We don't know what crimes he committed. But, he has been helping us construct our houses. His name is Vasco De Gama. This is the side of him that we know. We know nothing about the kind of person you think he is. I know a different version of him. Where is he?! Did the hit you at home? Yeah. John hit me once. But Catherine hit me four times. If they hit me more, I would have liked it. Why? Whenever they hit me, I felt like I was becoming even more crazy about you. What do you like about me? Madness. Yes, I am mad. If you are mad, I am your dad. Then, show me your madness. We are in a bus. There are people around us. I don't see anyone around. If you look, you will see people around you. If you don't look, you cannot see anyone around you. ♪I wonder what magic spell you cast upon me. ♪ ♪I don't know what I've become. ♪ ♪And suddenly♪ ♪In a flash, ♪ ♪I fell under your spell. ♪ ♪My heart stopped when I heard the sound of your eyelashes snapping, ♪ ♪I have become desperate. ♪ ♪I wonder what magic spell you cast on me. ♪ ♪I don't know what I've become. ♪ ♪If you are mad, ♪ ♪I am your dad. ♪ ♪Oh, if you are mad, ♪ ♪I am your dad. ♪ ♪The nectar of your lips. ♪ ♪The deliciousness of your kisses, ♪ ♪Your strong desire, ♪ ♪I can see it in the way you hug me. ♪ ♪It can stall it for a day. ♪ ♪Or perhaps even two days. ♪ ♪If my age keeps asking me for this warmth, ♪ ♪What can anyone do? ♪ ♪If you are mad, ♪ ♪I am your dad. ♪ ♪Oh, if you are mad, ♪ ♪I am your dad. ♪ ♪This love is my chariot of flowers. ♪ ♪♪You are the name that I call often. ♪ ♪Who I am and who you are, ♪ ♪We are nothing but♪ ♪signatures of each another. ♪ ♪This blazing hot fire between us♪ ♪Doesn't give us a moment's respite. ♪ ♪It's in the nature of wind to fuel this fire. ♪ ♪It isn't the one to show any mercy. ♪♪ ♪If you are mad, ♪ ♪I am your dad. ♪ ♪If you are mad, ♪♪ ♪I am your dad. ♪ I read it in the papers. I was thrilled to find that Ramya Gowarikar has shaken up the Mumbai underworld, and caught and arrested all the gangsters there. But, when that very same Ramya is pointing her gun at me, I feel a bit tensed. Madam, I like sincere police officers like you. But I hate gangsters like you. Guns down! Guns down! None of you will be spared. Neither will you escape this. If you want to crossfire, we are ready. Think about it for a bit, madam. What do you take a police officer for?! Duty is my religion. Ma'am people like you should stay alive. They shouldn't get killed in a silly shootout such as this. Scoundrel! Madam, I beg you. Please don't shoot. We will all be killed in crossfire. Please, madam. Monica! Come here. Monica! How many times did I warn you, you idiot?! You never changed. and you dragged Monica into this. Madam? Madam? Monica, come here. -John! Come here! -Brother! John! I beg you, madam. Please, madam. Please, madam. Please, madam. Please, madam. Please don't go for a shootout. Come, madam. Monica! Let's go! Please, madam. Please, madam. Idiot! Quite soon, the police are going to shoot at him. What do you want to do with a guy like him? What can we do if he is shot? We can only do something if he isn't shot at. Are you going to live with him? Or do you want to get married? I just don't understand this. Tell me, what do you expect of him? Nothing. I don't have any sort of future plans. I just like him. See, baby. When I was in college, I met someone like him. He left me breathless. I was living in a constant state of excitement. That was at a time when the mobile phones were just in. Incoming and outgoing calls costed Rs. 16 per minute. I would spend my entire nights talking to that idiot. All nonsense. We didn't do anything at all. At the end of the month, when we got a huge bill, my father took a belt and beat me black and blue. The belt was provided by my neighbours' kid. Do you know who that neighbor's kid is? Your brother. That is when I understood... ...that your brother was sincerely in love with me. And that the one I was chatting with was a total fraud. So, what I'm trying to tell you is that At your age, it is difficult to differentiate between love and lust. See.... Your father hit you because of the mobile phone bill. Now...incoming and outgoing are almost free. Our neighbors don't even have a son who can fall in love with me. The only option that I have... is him. So, let me make this mistake. Only if I make a mistake, I'll have something to tell my children. Monica, that's not... Shut up! Shut up! What do you know about our pain? Only if you face the situation we are in, you will understand our pain. From tomorrow onwards, you are not allowed to go out. You are not allowed to speak to him. There will be round the clock police security around you. Idiot! Lord, please grant this wandering family a secured home. We are vexed with wandering about. Amen. Ask god. Ask god to make your grandson forget that girl. He is obsessed with her. Bring the girl to meet me once. I will take a look at her. I will bring her, grandma. If you bring her, she is going to be followed by the police And they are going to shoot your grandson. What nonsense are you talking? Why will they shoot my grandson and kill him? Granny, do you really not know anything? Or is it because you simply like to pretend that you are innocent? Do you have any idea as to what your grandson does or what we do?! Come here. Tell her what we do. Tell her. You tell her what we do. Tell me. Annie! We are all gangsters. -Hey! We kill people for money. And this is our business. Annie! Tell your grandson to stop obsessing over that girl. If he goes around with her, he will surely die! Your grandson hit Chiko with a belt in the exact same circumstances. What he does it right and if someone else does the same thing, it's wrong, huh? We are all wrong and he is right?! Chiko, I hit you that day because I was worried about what might happen to you. If you have the same concern for me today, hit me. Hit me. No, buddy. Are you going to hit me or not? I won't. -Hit me! I will hit you. -Hit me. Annie! Hit me! Annie, no! Don't hit him! Hold grandma! Idiot! Say it! Say it! Will you let her go or not?! Say you will forget her! Hit me! Will you forget that that girl or not? Tell me. That day, when I hit him, he didn't say anything.

He wants to meet with you somehow. Go to this address and meet him. What about the police? I will deal with the police... You run away from church backside. Where is Vasco? I miss you. Happy birthday. Today is not my birthday. That kid said that it was. Who was that? In the church. Then, it's a police trap. Ramya! If you are close to me, they wouldn't shoot me. Hold the gun. Fire! When there was a lot of shooting going on, why did you hold that girl? When I saw you, I finally understood. I don't know when I'll be able to get out. That is why I hugged her. Do you really like her that much? I never thought someone like you would be in love. That's what you understood? I haven't gone that far enough as to love her. Why? Because it is a weakness, madam. Love means pain. If something goes wrong, women merely cry. But in the case of men, they wail and completely break down. I don't like to cry. Don't scare me with this love business. Are you scared of love? You've worked hard to uplift that slum. Isn't that love? Madam, loving one's country is different from loving a woman. I love India. That doesn't cost me even a penny to say it. I love you. That will the end of it.. Please, let me see Vasco once. Why must you see him? He says that he doesn't love you. -I know that. Even I don't love him. If it isn't love, what have you guys been doing all along? We'll do whatever we want. Please leave us. I will stay right here. John! Both of you go home. Let her stay here the whole night here. That's when she'll realize it. Cathy! -John... A lot of people name their lust as love. But even though the both of them were in love, they still think that it's lust. Both of them share the same feelings. Their thoughts are similar too. Both are mad... madly in love. What have you done? She sat outside the whole night because she was adamant that she wanted to meet you. You've made a mockery of such a decent family! Disgusting! Madam, Vasco says that he wants to meet Monica. If not, he is threatening to kill the constable. I will come. Alright, madam. Oh gosh! Come, madam. They've really beaten me up. These days, the police have become very romantic, madam. It's because I told them to, they stopped with this treatment. If not, they would have thrown you in a solitary cell. Where is Monica? -What are you going to talk to Monica about? You created such a mess to speak to her. Madam, I will tell you honestly what's in my heart. I like her. This is our last meeting. Please call her once. Monica! Did you cry the whole night? They said that you will be sentenced to death by hanging. Is this true? No. At the most, they will give me a life sentence. Do you think you are a judge? Is that why you are forecasting the sentence? This month, they are going to take me to the court. If it pleases the judge and he gives me a sentence of two or three years, I am going to behave good and stay right here. If they sentence me for life, within 24 hours, I am going to be by your side. How is that possible? I'll jump on to the jail wall. Whatever we do, we do it right now. We can never experience this age and this madness ever again. If it's two or three years, you will tolerate it. But if it's fourteen years, you will lose interest in me and vice versa. Read the newspaper. We'll decide soon. Whatever we do, we do it right now. We can never experience this age and this madness ever again. Monica happily went back to performing at programs with her sister-in-law. Vasco, who is in jail, is happy too. Every Sunday, Vasco's grandmother distributed money at the church. No one seems stressed... ...except me. After a month, the court gave out its judgement. Vasco was given a life sentence. But there was a small doubt that he might try to escape from the jail. Stop! Stop! Madam, when he tried to escape, we caught him and placed him in solitary cell. Good. If they give me a life sentence, within 24 hours of the judgement, I will be by your side. Where is the solitary cell? Madam! There is a big hole here. Go and look. Check what's down there! Madam, there is a big tunnel here. This is the only tunnel he dug in his entire life. It's a long one-kilometer tunnel. From Aguada central jail to a cattle shed. He dug this a long time ago. Every time he was arrested, he was put in central jail. He dug the tunnel to the solitary cell. Whenever he wishes, he created a ruckus and he would be sent to solitary cell. Idiot! What a mastermind! The entire gang was dressed in police uniforms and was moving about in police vehicles. They confused the whole department. Tunnel? To the jail? The police cannot catch him. If he is to be caught, it should be by us. Only he knows the places where he hid the money and how much money each place has. Establish check points and roadblocks across Goa. Inform all the check posts. These people are not policemen. Brother? Without our knowledge, they hid the money right under our ship. They are transferring the money in the boxes onto vehicles. And all of them are dressed as policemen. And all the vehicles they are using are police vehicles. John! -Yes, madam. Vasco escaped from jail. -What?! Where is your sister? She is right in front of me, madam. Make sure she stays there. I am coming right away. -Sure, madam. Monica! Monica! Monica! She is escaping, madam. Follow her! Seize both those cars and hide all the money in the houses. The construction of those houses mustn't stop. Where is Vasco? Check the vehicle. Check if the money is at the back. Check if the money is at the back. No, there is no money. Where are you going? John. -Yes, madam. Track Monica's mobile immediately and find her location. Your friend and your girlfriend are with me. Tell me, who do I kill first? Your friend? Or your girlfriend? Friend... ...Or girlfriend? Friend? I think girlfriend is the better choice. Annie! Vasco! Annie... Annie... Annie! Vasco! -Annie! Annie! Annie! Annie! Annie! Annie! Vasco! Let him go! Let him go! Vasco, let him go! Surrender, Vasco! Thank you, madam. -Vasco! Vasco! Stop there! Vasco! Vasco, stop! Vasco! Grab the rod. Vasco! Vasco! Listen to me! Vasco! Vasco! Gun down! Otherwise, I'll shoot you. Vasco! Stop it! -Remove Monica, listen to me. Surrender. -Monica? Listen to me! Vasco, listen to me! -Open it Vasco! Gun down! Gun down! -Open it Vasco, gun down! Listen to me! Vasco, gun down! Listen to me! Otherwise, I will shoot you. Vasco, stop it! -Madam, this is my last request. Let both of us go, please. Vasco, you have no other option than to surrender. Madam, I cannot live without her. Please try to understand, madam. We are going to go somewhere else and live. Please let us go. You must to live your life out in prison. I don't like that option. If I go to the prison once again, I will never come out, madam. I know that. I beg you. Please let us go. Idiot! Listen to me. If you surrender, you can live in jail. Madam, I cannot live without her. I am unable to live without her! I will give you whatever the amount of money you want. Please try to understand. I am repeatedly begging you. Imagine that you have never seen me and go away! Vasco, it's over! -No, it's not over! Yes, it's over, Vasco! No, it's not over! If you stand in my way, I will even shoot you and take her away with me. Fool! You... Monica, stop it! Why don't you tell him? Please let us go, madam. Are you mad?! He is already a criminal! Let him go and come here. There is no future with him. Come here, Monica! Listen to him! Come here! -No! Open... open... Open... Get back! Get back! Monica! Listen to me. Get back! Monica! Get back! No, madam. Please don't shoot Vasco! If anyone comes close, I will kill you all. Open the gate. What happened? -It's locked. It's locked. Monica... I think I am in love with you. I am in love with you, Vasco. Madam, this is my last warning. Are you letting me go or are we going to shoot each other? Let's go ahead and shoot each other. -Madam, I believe in this principle. Do or die. Shall we shoot at each other? -Go ahead and shoot! One... Two... Three... Vasco... Why didn't you shoot? Why the hell didn't you fire? My dad used to tell me this. Son, Duty is my Religion. What do you take the police for? Duty is my religion. I could see my father in you. I can't kill a sincere cop. Grandson! Grandma! Don't come. Can you handle seeing your grandson's death? No, I cannot. I cannot watch it. Then, don't come close. No, I cannot bear it. Don't come close. I cannot see this. Vasco, are you dying? Just go home. Vasco, are you dying? You go home. Vasco... Monica... Monica! Monica! Monica! Vasco! Vasco! At that moment, I cried as much as his grandmother. That's because... That girl died for him. And he died for a police officer. I lamented over the fact that someone like him wasn't there in our police department. I saw a lot of criminals in my life. But I've never seen an intense guy like him. No doubt he is ruthless. But he has integrity. In the newspapers tomorrow, it will be written â€œThe end of a gangsterâ€ But I believe it's an end of a great love story. ♪No, I cannot. ♪ ♪If you go away from me, my breathe will stop♪ ♪No, I absolutely cannot make it. ♪ ♪If you go away from me, my heart will simply stop♪ ♪No, I absolutely cannot make it. ♪ ♪I cannot live without you. ♪ ♪When I saw you with my heart, ♪ ♪That is when, I wove you into my heart. ♪ ♪When you are running down my eyes like water, ♪ ♪It's as if the ground beneath my feet is slipping away. ♪ ♪No, I cannot make it. ♪ ♪I cannot make it. ♪ ♪I cannot make it. ♪
