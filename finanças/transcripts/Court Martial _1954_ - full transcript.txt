Thank you,I don't think I will Good night,Sir Good night,Capt.Graham "Race from the Royal Artillery Gold Cup "for which there were 22 runners some like Fairy Glade and Phantom" "with a number of victories to their credit" "and some like actual winner Peter Pan ridden by Maj. Copper Carrington" "who confounded the experts that you will see for yourself" "for now for the film" "They are coming into line very well indeed" "Peter Pan taken his break from the outside and they are off" "Its a very good start and Foron comes to the front now with.." War Hero V.C. charged with fraud Well,it makes fine reading,doesn't it? You know,Copper I still think you ought to plug with legal rights business Listen to this Chapter 6 paragraph 26 Oh,no,Jim,that's not our line if wanted a legal privilege we should hire a lawyer And I still think we should have Why? I'm the only person who knows what really happened why pay somebody else to tell them That'll be for us Yes? Major Carrington please,court's opening,Sir Thank you,Sgt. So you got stuck with court orderly Sgt.Crane I'm afraid that's a rotten charge That's all right,Sir I only wish there was something I could do to help,Sir Look here,Jim you're quite naked without a belt Jim,got your gun? Why? You'd be a pretty foolish looking escort if I decided to run for it Come on,Copper,we can't keep them waiting I don't know why not,nothing certainly can't start without me Hold it please Major One minute Orders by Lt General Sir Wilford Nicholas Blunt Dated 25th April London The details of offices as mentioned below will assemble at the Royal Artillery Barracks,Crayshott on the 12th Day of May for the purpose of trying by General Court Martial the accused person named in the margin Brigadier A S Meadmore, Commander of the British Empire Distinguished Service Order, is appointed President Members Sir Here,Sir Here,Sir Maj.EPM Broke-Smith of the 11th Hussars Here,Sir Mr A T Terry,that is myself, is appointed Judge advocate Major Carrington,do you object to be tried by me as President? Or by any of the officers whose names you heard read over? No,Sir Can you tell me where they are holding this Court Martial? Yes,that building over there with the pillars in front Thanks The witnesses will now withdraw Major Carrington have your rights under the Rules of Procedure been fully explained to you? Yes,Sir I understand that you've chosen to conduct your own defense you realize you may be putting yourself in a disadvantage by not engaging Counsel I'd rather have it this way,Sir I simply want to tell the court what happened and leave the rest to them That seems quite a sensible thing to do Are you Major Charles ON Paul Carrington Victoria Cross,Distinguished Service Order,Royal Artillery an officer of the regular forces? Yes,Sir You are charged with First charge Under Section 17 of the Army Act when concerned in the care of the public property fraudulently misapplying the same Hello cookie Jay,they've started you can't go in yet The Globe can go in anywhere Are you guilty or not guilty of the first charge against you which you have heard read? Not guilty,Sir Second Charge under Section 15 1 of the Army Act absenting yourself without leave? You got Carrington,Walter? Yes I've got Carrington and the President You've got the girl yet Which girl? Captain Graham the little numbering khaki they found in his bedroom Third and last charge Under Section 40 of the Army Act conduit to the prejudice of good order and military discipline in that you at Crayshott on the 7th of April improperly entertained an officer of the Women's Royal Army Corps to which Capt. AL Graham in your bedroom in the military barracks are you guilty or not guilty of the third charge against you, of which you have heard read? Not guilty,Sir Maj. Carrington you may be seated Thank you,Sir Does the prosecutor propose to make an opening address? Yes,Sir May it please record it will not be necessary for me detain you long Of the three charges the first is the only one on which I shall dwell Up till April 7th this year the accused was in command of the 24th heavy antiaircraft battery You will hear the evidence of the pay Sgt of the battery that shortly before noon on April the sixth the sum of 140£ lot was drawn from the bank for payment of a draft due to leave for abroad that afternoon You'll hear the evidence of Mr DA Ashwell of Lloyd's Bank Crayshott that on the morning of April the fifth the accused,whose bank account was overdrawn paid in,in person a sum of 100 £ in one pound notes And asked that this amount should be transferred immediately to the account of his wife in a London Bank There is,as so often,where fraud is alleged no direct evidence,no one saw the accused take this money from the battery safe but it will,I think be quite clear to you when you've heard the evidence that these 125£ notes were the same notes which were drawn for the payment of the draft of the previous pay and lodged in the battery's safe I turn now to the other two charges In the second charge that with absence without leave you will hear the evidence of the accused commanding officer who expressly refused Maj. Carrington leave of absence to ride in the Royal Artillery meeting and you'll hear that the accused did so absent himself for that very purpose Touching the third charge Col.Henniker had issued a regimental order which you may think was a very legitimate and reasonable order that officers were not to entertain members of the Woman's Royal Army Corps in their single quarter in barracks Evidence will show that the accused disregarded this order That's all I propose to say at this stage with the court's permission I will now proceed to call evidence Call Sgt. Owen Sir Take the book in your right hand and repeat the oath after me -I swear by Almighty God -I swear by Almighty God The evidence before this court should be the truth,the whole truth and nothing but the truth You are number 962473 Sgt.Owen of 24th Heavy Antiaircraft Battery Royal Artillery? No,Sir -I beg you pardon? -Bombardier I am,Sir His down on my list as a Sgt.,Sir You are down on the list of witnesses as Sgt.,Owen Yes,Sir Oh I see when this summary was taken you were Sgt., and now you're bombardier -Is that correct? -Yes,that's quite correct,Sir You are pay Sgt. or pay Bombardier of the 24th Heavy Antiaircraft Battery? -No,Sir -No? Bombardier Owen will you take this in stages On the 6th April this year were you pay Sgt. of 24th Heavy Antiaircraft Battery? -Yes,Sir -Thank you Yes,Sir Yes,Sir On the afternoon on the 6th of April what the draft you to leave the battery for overseas? Yes,Sir -Was the draft paid that day? -No,Sir -No,Sir -Why not? Their move was postponed,Sir What happened to the money which should have been drawn? Put it back in the battery safe,Sir So,there was,for the moment, more money than usual in the battery safe? Yes,Sir -Who had the key? -I did,Sir Do you always keep the keep the key of the battery safe? Yes,Sir -Is that usual? -Couldn't say,Sir Highly unusual and strictly against regulations Well,Sir,the Maj always said he was more likely to lose the key than I was to pinch the cash,Sir Was the key continuously in your possession from noon on 6th April until say noon on the 7th? No,Sir What happened to it? Don't look around with the accused, please,just answer my question The Maj borrowed it,Sir To the court please,not to me The major,you mean the accused? Borrowed the key of the safe from you? Yes,Sir When did he borrow it? Just after dinner,Sir, that afternoon the 6th -Did he give it back to you? -Yes,Sir What time was that? At 930 the following morning,Sir, just before he left for Sandown Now we pass on to sudden two hours later Did Capt. Graham of the Woman's Royal Army Corps come to the Battery office to speak to you? She came to the battery office,Sir -And spoke to you? -Yes,Sir In consequence of what she said did you open the office safe and checked the money in it? Yes,Sir I won't ask you any more about that matter at the moment but did shortly after that,did the adjutant come to the office? Yes,Sir -Did he ask you for key of the safe? -Yes,Sir One moment,please,I don't know your name I was speaking to your escort,Maj Carrington -Mitchell,Sir -Major Mitchell You are Maj Carrington's escort your duty are to restrain him for flight and to suppress any attempted violence in his part you're not there to assist in his defense Sorry,Sir You say the adjutant asked you for your key of the safe? Yes,Sir -Did you give it to him? -No,Sir-Why not? I was responsible to my Battery Commander for the contents of the safe,Sir Did the Adjutant tell you that he had Col.Henniker's authority to open the safe? Yes,Sir,but I was responsible to my Battery Commander not to the Col.,Sir Yes,what happened then? When,Sir? When you refused to give the key to the adjutant Well,Sir,there was a few words passed and I found myself under arrest That explains the missing stripe on you,Owen It's right,Sir Did the adjutant eventually opened the safe? -Yes,Sir -How With the duplicate key which in our Regiment is kept in the Regimental Office to fed all the Battery sites, which was news to me May I interrupt,Sir? Certainly Are we going to hear more about this regimental key to the battery safe? -May I say something on that,Sir? -Certainly I can assure the court that key is not important I'm not going to deny that this money was missing and I'm certainly not going to suggest that the Adjutant took it With respect,Sir,that is not the point at issue whatever the accused may choose to admit the prosecution must still show that the money was in the safe at one time and then found to be missing and for that we need the evidence about the key I quite agree We can't rely on a casual admission by the accused to establish the prosecution's case We'll take that evidence If you please,Sir -Now bombardier Owen -One moment please Mr Tester Terry I have some news on this point Yes,Sir I like to discuss them with you more privately,Court Orderly Clear the court One moment,Bombardier Owen Sir Please remember that you're giving evidence you must not discuss this case with anyone during the adjournment Very good,Sir It seems that I must remind you,Mr Terry That there is only one president of this Court Martial Your decision to hear the evidence about the key is taken without reference to me But surely the Judge advocate's responsible for guiding the court on purely legal points Responsible to the President,Mr Terry And he takes no decisions Now shall we both glance through the summary and see where all this evidence about this key is really necessary -May we smoke,Sir? -Certainly Pretty careless trusting a pay Sgt. with a key of the safe I suppose we all have done it sometimes depends on the pay Sgt. May I borrow one of you? Oh the worst lightning a pipe Thanks so much I was pay Sgt. once,no one trusted me with the key of the safe He just said it depends on the pay Sgt.,old boy Alison,you can't come in here I'm in You mustn't be,you're supposed to be on the other side If they find you in here they'll shoot the lot of us No one saw me coming in Look,Alison they'll only think we're cooking up something So I am I've come to ask Copper what he wants me to say That's wonderful for the prosecution witness Just stick to facts don't think up helpful answers That should be easy for her she's very unconvincing liar, haven't you noticed? No,so either I've never heard her tell a lie or she's not so unconvincing.Which? BTW did you warn the other witnesses what time they were wanted Yes,Sir,yes I did,hello Winston,hello BTW I told Col Henniker we would not want him now until after lunch -Seems a bit disappointed -Oh,why? He can't wait until get into that witness box Queer bloke What makes you say that? Nothing just I can't stand him Look at that third charge Just because the poor girl got into a flap and went to Carrington's room Henniker ought to have known there was nothing in there not on Carrington side,every one else does Have you been gossiping about this case in the mess? Who,me? Good Lord no,I'm a blooming oyster,you know I am? But I don't stop them talking to me Winston,stop it By them I suppose you mean that blonde you sat next to her at dinner last night Yes,what do you think of her? Just your thought I thought How swell,what a shape even in uniform, this regiment can pick them Yes I served her a glass of port -You know what she told me? -No Carrington and the Colonel had the best of six rounds in Carrington's room that night but Henniker had a beautiful black eye next morning A real shiner You do get hold of some wonderful stories Yes I somebody think in intelligence might be my real line Are we going to see this CO who keeps keys to fit all the battery safes Certainly Is that a common habit in the Royal Regiment of Artillery,Col.? Never heard of it in my life before This chap like that commands all the batteries in the regimental office Oh you know him,do you? What is he like? Henniker,a proper bastard in my opinion -Col.Reeve -Sir? -You're making an improper remark -Yes,Sir,it was,Sir I'm sorry I don't agree anyway I was at staff college with Henniker We thought he was quite outstanding Stop,gentlemen I really must ask you not to allow your personal opinion of a witness to influence your judgment of his evidence Do you men,Sir that even if you'd known a man for 20 years you should assess his evidence only what you've seen of him in the witness box? Most certainly That's the official view,Panton, so I refrain from comment Do I gather that you don't agree I want the right answer,that's all Carrington's whole future depends upon the decision of this court A true verdict,that's all that matters Wish all the help we can get, not calling any witnesses at our end What do you mean? -Isn't Valerie giving evidence? -No Why not? A wife can give evidence,can't she? She's not up to it Is she ill again? Not again,still But let's ask for an adjournment until she's well,they have to grant it Look I don't want Val brought down here Just don't want to her let in for all this By God what good could she do it? She'll only quote facts and figures tell them about our fatal gap between our income and expenses I can do that Show them your bankbook I suppose It's all down there Do you really think that a lot of figures in a bank book mean anything compared to seeing your wife in court? You know they don't -Jim -I said what I think Copper it's not a lot to ask her? Just to come down and tell them herself what hell these last two years have been for her For both of you Why is that come out better than my telling them that she practically had a nervous breakdown as a result of it Because inside two minutes if she puts her mind to it,she have that court eating out of her hand Now look the aim is to acquit me because they believe that I didn't steal this money not because they'd fallen for my wife Anyway she's not giving evidence because she's not up to it She can stand on her two feet, she ought to come So she would if I insisted you can't drag a woman into court Can't you? I'm being dragged I was ordered to attend I know I'm terribly sorry about that but that's the prosecution They can't order Val to attend No but you can Look this is very nice of you and all that but do you really think it's quite your business? -Do you? -Yes Yes I do,does that surprise you? You can't expect your friends not to care how this goes Anyway I'm in it now it's much too late to tell me to keep out Once this is over I'll stand down I know my place But just for the moment what at one thing and another I think this is my business So do I,I am sorry Are you going to tell them that Valerie phoned that morning and demanded the money by return of post? Yes,of course And that she threatened to commit suicide if she didn't get it? No Two minutes ago you were asking me to tell them everything -Not that side of it -But that That's the side to tell them You needn't blame her,Copper, no one wants you to do that She got some bills she couldn't pay and she was desperate Anyone can get desperate All right,don't Don't lift a finger,don't even try Stand up in court and a nice military man and answer their questions in a nice military way and then start looking for a nice civilian job because that's what you're going to need Major Carrington,Major Mitchell, Sir,court reassembling Thank you,Sgt. -You must get out of here -Now wait We have to go in first,let's kill a couple of minutes and the hall will be clear All right Copper I'm sorry I spoke like this -Ready -Yes Now Bombardier Owen you've told the court that on the morning April 7th the accused borrowed the key of the safe from you Except that one occasion was the key of the safe ever out of your possession My key wasn't so but the duplicate key was in the Regimental Office all that time At least I suppose it was Set your mind at rest,Bombardier Owen,it was,under lock and key Now cast your mind back to the evening of that day did Capt. Graham returned to the office bringing with her some money? -I don't know,Sir -What do you mean,don't know? Did she or didn't she? Capt. Graham returned to the office bringing with her an envelope which she asked me to put in the safe,Sir Didn't she tell you what was in the envelope? No,Sir -What did she tell you? -I beg you pardon,Sir I am supposed to say what Capt. Graham said to me? I don't think he should answer that question,Major Monson Bombardier Owen evidently remembers what the girl said to the soldier isn't evidence I'll put it in another way then -Did Capt. Graham give you the envelope? -Well,no Sir Come on Bombardier I don't want to extract this by tooth by tooth,what did she do with it? Nothing,because I told her that balloon had gone up and it was too late You told Capt. Graham it was too late meaning that the money had already been missed? Yes,Sir Please,speak up so that the court can hear you answer Is that what you meant to tell Capt. Graham? -That the money had already been missed? -Yes,Sir Thank you,that is all Do you wish to cross examine the witness,Major Carrington? Yes,please -Bombardier Owen -Yes,Sir Can you say when I first joined 24th Battery? Yes,Sir,June 10th 1952,Sir I can produce posting orders but I assure you Bombardier Owen is quite infallible -We take the Bombardier's word for it -Thank you,Sir In the course of your duty did you help me to press various claims for money -due me from the Paymaster? -Yes,Sir Sgt.,close that window Now Bombardier Owen Can you quote then total amount which I claimed? Yes,Sir,207£ 3 4p Can you say what's the money was due for? Just the main headings Yes,Sir, disturbance allowances for three moves in 11 months between July 1951 and June 52 Command pay in Hong Kong for just over 5 months in 1952 Compensation for loss of kitchen ware on HM Vanessa sunk in Aug 1950 and seven minor items,Sir Can you say how many letters we wrote between us about all this? Yes,Sir,there was 33 proper letters, Sir,not counting the 14 reminders I'm afraid you put in a lot of overtime on my private affairs,Bombardier Owen I never minded that,Sir I like to produce them so they are copies from the battery Exhibit H 1,Exhibit H 1 to 33 These will be signed by the President and the text of the proceedings Go on,please Did the paymaster ever admit liability of any part of our claim? Yes,Sir,one of those letters dated February 12 for missing claims for 190 £ and 4 p,Sir Did the pay on that date? No,Sir,the letter said that they had yet not verified the Part 2 order posting in Hong Kong 1950, Sir,so they send them along One more question,Bombardier Owen On the 7th of April when you and Capt. Graham found that this money was missing you did your best to cover up the loss -Well,Sir -That was very friendly of you both Would you please tell the court had I asked you to do that? No,Sir,you hadn't you weren't even there We did it on our own,Sir -Thank you Bombardier Owen,that's all -Thank you Sir Do you wish to reexamine,Maj Monson? No thank you,Sir -Have you any questions,Sir? -No,thank you-Any questions from the court? No Very well,Bombardier Owen you may stand down Call Capt. Graham please Sgt. Sir -What is your name? Sgt. Crane,Sir Well,Sgt. Crane could you please refrain from making quite such a clatter in the court of your duties? Yes,Sir Very sorry,Sir Quite possible to be smart without stamping A barbaric habit introduced quite in recent times by Her Majesty Foot guards One small point,Major Monson Do you think your overworked assistant could arrange a supply of drinking water for me? Certainly,Sir,would you mind? Take the book in your right hand and repeat the oath after me -Oh,Sgt. -Sir Our President is thirsty,can you get him something to drink? -Pardon? -Oh,just water Yes,Sir,right away,Sir Earlier that day you had a telephone call from Mrs Carrington,who was in London? Yes,Sir As a result of that telephone conversation what did you do? I went to Major Carrington's battery office One moment please This telephone call I realize of course that we can't get from Capt. Graham what Mrs Carrington said but I presume we should her more later That is not for the Prosecutor to say so I'm not calling my wife for she is not well enough to give evidence Can I help you? I was looking for the Court Martial room? I'll show you I'm just going in their myself Are you member of the court? Nothing so grand I'm afraid I'm just Prosecutor's assistant Are you friend of Major Carrington? I'm his wife You were saying Capt. Graham -One moment please,Sgt. Crane -Sir Settle the glass with the left hand Thank you Capt. Graham you say you went to Major Carrington's office,what did you do there? I saw the pay Sgt. and asked him to check the cash in the safe Did he find the cash correct? No,Sir There were 125£ missing What did you do then? I went away and got 125 £ -I was going to -Please You went away and got 125£ Where from? From my Battery commander Major Holt He was holding some money for Major Carrington I see,so you got this money from Major Holt and then? I took it back to the 24th Battery meaning to put it in the safe But the money had already been missed It had Oh,Capt. Graham later that same evening the accused The accused came out of hospital and returned to the mess Did you see him on his return? Yes Where did you see him? In his room The accused was then occupying single court in the mess? Yes,Sir Capt. Graham you know the regimental order against officers entertaining members of the Women's Royal Army Corps in their single quarters? Major Carrington wasn't entertaining me He didn't ask me to go to see him I went I had to talk to him Did he ask you to leave? Yes,at once He told me that I had no right to be there and he begged me to go away But he made no effort to compel you to leave? Compel me? Didn't shout for help if that what you mean One moment,please,Major Carrington You told me just now that you won't asking your wife to give evidence because she was ill? That's right,Sir I got the impression apart from that you would have called her? Yes,Sir Is that your wife who just come into court? Yes,Sir If you do mean to call her as witness she shouldn't be in court My husband doesn't mean to call me as a witness Can I take that as quite definite Major Carrington? Well if there's any doubt why not discuss it with your wife during the next adjournment? Very well,Sir In that case,Mrs Carrington, I must ask you to withdraw Sgt. Crane show Mrs Carrington where she can wait Go on,please, Major Monson Capt. Graham you say you went to the accused's room to talk to him But what did you want to say? I wanted to tell him what had happened and what I had done about the money And I wanted to tell him that Col Henniker was out to get him -Capt. Graham -I'm sorry,Sir The prosecutor asked me what I said to Major Carrington and I told him -Here you are,Ma'am -Thank you Major shouldn't be long Shall I light the fire,Ma'am? Oh,no,no but I wonder if you could get me some cigarettes, I know I've run out Take these,Ma'am,just to go along with But what about you? Will be all right until lunchtime You're not allowed to smoke in there anyway You must let me pay for this Oh no please there’s only one or two in it,you know I'd rather not Very well,thank you Sgt. How long were you in the accused's court room that night? About half an hour I think Till Col Henniker came in And what happened then Well,he came in,he burst in,he didn't even knock I think he hoped to he might surprise us in bed or something Capt. Graham by now you'd know better than to make remark like that Col Henniker was very rude to me,Sir he said some quite outrageous things I think you must regard that as one of the risk of your profession,Capt. Graham -Just tell the court what happened -I can't,Sir He and Major Carrington started an argument and I left the room As a matter of fact I was sent out of the room Thank you,Capt. Graham That is all Capt. Graham on 7th of April when you found that I'd taken 125 £ from my battery safe you went to lot of trouble to put it back -Yes -Please don't think I'm not grateful but Had I asked you to do that? No you hadn't You didn't know anything of what I was doing Thank you Now you say that when you came to my room that night I told you that I'd taken this money Yes Have you ever heard me saying I might do that? Yes,but I haven't believed you Will you please tell the court about that conversation It was the day before in the morning about at 11 o'clock I met you coming out of Col Henniker's office You said that you had another row with him about the money the government owed you Go on You said he wasn't doing a thing to back up your claim and you were sick of waiting You said you told him that and you told him that you were going to take the money out of the battery safe Are you quite sure? I mean that I told Col Henniker I was going to take that money Perfectly sure Thank you,oh,there was one more question The court has heard that I was riding in the Royal Artillery meetings Can you say whether I was riding my own horses? I know you weren't You don't own any horses nowadays I'm sorry,Sir,I was just correct the impression I was careering around Sandown Park on my own expensive animals We take your point,Mr Carrington Thank you Capt. that was all Major Monson No thank you,Sir -Any questions,Sir -No thank you Capt. Graham,you may go Will you take Major Holt now Sir? I think we might -If that suits you,Sir? -Just as you like,Mr Terry We could take Major Holt or -We could take luncheon -As you please,Sir Luncheon I think The court is adjourned we resume at 2 15 Hello,hello love Hello You are a surprise I didn't know that you were up and about Darling,you haven't even keeping me in touch I crawled out of bed the day before yesterday How are you? Where are the handcuffs? They trust Jim to look after me Nice to you both How goes it Jim? In court? We've just finished Alison evidence and adjourned for lunch -Is Alison doing her stuff? -Well,she's pretty good Sorry,I wouldn't let you stop and see the show you really ought not to have come at all Every one else thought I ought to Everyone meaning your father? Well,you did say you didn't want me to come,darling,I told him that I said that nobody forced you to come Nobody forced me Just said ,he thought it looked better I thought you might be pleased to see me Of course I am Just wished the circumstances were different So do I Now you are here how do you feel about giving evidence? But you said that you didn't want me to -I didn't think you were fit -I'm not If you like I produce a doctor's certificate That won't be necessary What sort of evidence do you mean anyway? What about? Nothing personal a difficult gesture Given them the facts of life about the army tell them about the gap between what they paid us and what we they forced us to spend But you can tell them that? He's not so well on the economic subject as you are,I've heard you Good Heavens,you don't need eloquence,just give them the figures Tell them what 6 months in a furnished flat in Singapore did to our war savings The year in a hotel in Hong Kong with a wife and two children cost just twice as much as they paid us Tell them the whole thing half killed me That's your stuff,that's what we want you to say But why can't Copper say it? But I don't look right,I don't look that anything half killed me I'm sorry Copper but I can't I know it's futile and wicked of me I can't Valerie,it wouldn't take ten minutes,it wouldn't take five -You've seen the court -Leave it Jim -Look now let me explain -Leave it All right,I'll expect you can do without me I'm going to see what they are doing about our food Oh,BTW I saw Nora Holt that came out of court she said will you lunch with them Valerie if you haven't fixed anything else -I couldn't face anyone -Why not? What have you done? I suppose you think I ought to have rung around and telling everyone not hide all this No,that'll be overdoing it Jim,all right Tell Nora I'd love to come say I'll be over in ten minutes -Right -And honestly You couldn't think less than I do I think the whole thing has been very hard on you I'm sorry about that Val Copper -What's the matter with me? -It's that you're not well yet,that's all Well,anyone else had taken it pull themselves together somehow,why can't I? Oh,I'll give evidence if I could,of course I would But I know when the moment came I just run out on you You wouldn't want that to happen No How're the boys? I think you ought to write to them I do not what to say It's very unfair isn't it? They shouldn't made of your responsible especially for a stepfather Val,look,I know I promised I keep you out of this thing as far as possible You must realize I shall have to tell the court why I took the money and I shall have to refer to your telephone call and and the letter Do you mean you're going to put the whole blame on me? No,no,my whole case is that the paymaster owned us money which she wouldn't pay in the end there was no fault of our own we go to a point where we couldn't wait any longer Can't you just say you've being pressed for money for the boy's school bill? Press so hard I had to take the money that same day? So you are going to say that it was what I said that made you do it I will put it that way Would it be so unfair if I did? Yes,of course it would I was frantic when I made that phone call I'd no other to say of course I'd never kill myself, how could I leave the boys I told that in my letter But your letter didn't arrive until afterward and I didn't feel inclined to take the risk if I see you won't go into the box I shall have to refer to the letter But that letter was private any letter is private, you've no right to read it all in public Read it all out in public You really think I'll do that? You remember the sort of things you said in this letter? Tear it up,please if that letter gets read out in court I'll think I'll die Promise you won't let them see it Look all I'm going to do is this I'm going to them that you rung me and said you had to had the money within 24 hours I shall explain you're ill and made some dire threat If they insist on confirmation then I read it through sentences,that's all I can't stand it I can't stand private affairs being read out in court for everyone to hear Isn't it a little late to be so sensitive? at the moment I don't have any private affairs I'm not allowed to have But I do,I'm not in the dock I didn't take any money I'm sorry I shouldn't have said that Look,there's one thing you have to understand I haven't done anything I'm ashamed of And I haven't got quite a case you know What's going to happen? -Tell me honestly -I'm going to get off,of course They can't make this charge stick I took the money openly I told Henniker I'm going to take it and then I took it whatever that was,it wasn't fraudulent Suppose you do get off what will we do? There's only one thing to do pick ourselves up and start again -In the army? -Yes,of course Copper give up the army Val,the only thing I know, is the only thing I want to do But why? Look at the army nowadays, look at the things they do to you? I know Go on tell me what's the attraction? Or left turn,right turn and the barracks square Oh no,there's more to it than that it's something I can do and people like Henniker can never do no matter of dizzy heights they reach We also certainly never reach any dizzy heights after this Won't you always be the man who pinched cash and got away with it? And wasn't it something about another woman Nobody taken that third charge seriously not even prosecution That's lucky for you that I am not,isn't it? Alison That would be the last straw Oh,well more of the wondering what's happened to me Val When this is over,what about us? They go on as they are I suppose No,no not as they are,another path I'm sure they are bound to move me and somehow get married quarters and quarters we could live No Copper we shouldn't stand a chance not in the army What you're saying is that you are prepared to live with me when things are easy but you're not prepared to make an effort when they are not I suppose so I dare say that's it Perhaps if you wanted it,postwar army career you married the wrong woman I'm sorry I shouldn't have said that You will come back,won't you? I mean this afternoon? Just think it over and just to be around,you know All right,I'll come back -Sugar,Sir? -No thank you -May we smoke,Sir? -Certainly May I? Sorry old boy,I really will buy some tomorrow If we are here tomorrow which I sincerely hope not That doesn't depend on us,I'm afraid I'd like to get away today if I can I'm quite ready to sit late in this setting Thank you What's your hurry,Broke-Smith? Don't tell me they make the cavalry work at this time of the year Oh,Lord no we finished the point-to-pointing feeding we've got nothing on until Ascot How do you like this idea of paying yourself out of impress when the paymaster is slow in dealing with your claims Well,it's original anyway Can you call it fraudulent misapplication,Sir if you've given a fair warning what you are going to do Quite possibly not But we don't know yet that he did give warning He told the Graham girl that he warned the Colonel So she says,he doesn't seem been telling anyone else We don't know that either Well,it will be in character anyway Carrington wouldn't sneak the money out of the safe,never Flying off for handling,taking it for gesture of defiance that's something different Am I wrong,Mr Terry are you looking a little cynical? It's possible I've never served on the jury until I joined the Judge Advocates branch I've never heard of a case discussed in closed court And you find it a painful experience In a way,yes As an advocate one labored long hours over one's brief Marshaled the evidence presented did this way or that and ended with an impassioned address Why? To what purpose I know now that any juror man in any court is moved solely by his personal prejudices Modified by whether or not he likes the look of the witness in the box Gentlemen,we seem to have destroyed Mr Terry's faith in the law Oh,not at all I believe that despite of their methods almost every court specially perhaps the court martial reach a just and proper verdict in the end That's help,we shan't be the court that disappoint you I feel quite sure you won't Major Monson I've been looking for you I was just on my way across -May I walk with you? -Please What can I do for you? I was wandering if I might be allowed to leave the barracks this afternoon Going to Crayshott I'm sorry the moment I let you go some new point would come up And the president wants to recall you? Is it very urgent? Your reason for wanting to go To be quite honest just wanted to get away I find this harrowing Yes,I'm sure you do No one is enjoying it Don't let them throw him out You know very well that doesn't rest with me Not in theory no Not in any way it's for the court to decide When they've heard the evidence But you can't want to see him chucked out? I don't,my duty as a Prosecutor is simply to behave impartially and to bring the whole transaction before the court -You know of the whole transaction? -Not yet I've only heard one side of it Not even that just the bare bone of one small bit of one sided Oh I know he behaved like an idiot,so does he But he's not like that way Do you want to know where he really worked for? Stop anyone of those men of those men and ask them Capt. Graham,you're wasting your talent it's the court you should attack not me -You're coming in? -No As I can't do anything with you I'll go back to my office and try and get some useful work done Anyway thanks for rejecting my advances so nicely Very unusual experience for you I am sure -If,if there's anything else -No thank you Right -Oh yes -Yes I’m supposed to set an example in barracks When you're asking our commanding officer what happened to Major Carrington in his room that night would you let it make it clear that the accused and I were not cuddled up in bed together? That's a reasonable request,all right I'll do that Thank you Oh Capt. Graham Yes -One question -Yes You said this morning that Major Carrington told you he was warned Col Henniker he was going to take the money, did Major Carrington say that? Yes Are you quite sure of that? Perfectly sure What started the trouble between Major Carrington and his Col.? Jealousy You? Good Heavens no,not a woman Nothing so reasonable What was Col Henniker doing during the war? Yes that's more like it Antiaircraft command for a whole company He never got overseas No,Woolwich,Chatham and all the bases to Dover Never out of touch with Southern Railways Well,you don't blame him for that,do you? Me? I blame him for everything Hello,Col.,have you been waiting for me? I just came to find out at what time I'll be wanted Well,Sir,you'll be the last my witnesses I'll say three o'clock or ten to might be safer I'll be outside the court room a quarter to three -All going smoothly? -Yes I think so Oh, one point came out this morning What then? A witness gave evidence that Carrington told you beforehand he meant to take the money from the battery safe This point is of importance Is it? Why? He still took the money Yes,but if he gave you prior warning it alters the whole character of the defense Really? If a bank clerk helps himself out of the till and says"Oh,I told my manager" -Ah,if the bank owed him money -You mean he'll get away with it? No I don't say that But obviously,still thinking of your bank clerk It's one thing to take money surreptitiously but quite another if he takes it openly After a dispute with the manager over the bank's debt to him Which witness said this? Or shouldn't I ask? Capt. Graham I see,did she hear Carrington tell me? No,she heard it from him -Isn't that hearsay? -No,it came from the accused Well,I suppose it's a line of defense You know,Col,this case worries me I find the whole defense out of character In an officer with Carrington's background Background? What background? You're not dazzled by his V.C. are you? I wouldn't say so That's the real trouble the blaze of adulation,that surrounds the V.C. and the rest of his service I don't say that it's his fault, Carrington spoiled Anything he wants he feels he has the right to If he wants leave he takes it but he wants to ask a woman up to is quarters he ignores all orders against it Background or no background he was short of money so he helped himself As simple as that? He just throws away his career pension for 125£ No,if he'd won at Sandown he meant to slip the money back He lost,well he'll get away with a summons Something will turn up, someone rallied around and help He's got plenty of friends Look here,Carrington's whole reputation was made up,so I had to book in 10 minutes He took over the gun layer hid on 25 pounds from a wounded Lance bombardier and knocked out five German tanks Well,that's more than most of us could do Very few of us get the chance Well,I don't underweight what he did But I didn't want a gun layer again I didn't even want a war hero I wanted a battery commander for a highly technical unit And they gave me Carrington Still he's not been tried for inefficiency,is he? No Your entitled to impute efficiency as a reason for refusing his leave That was my reason,of course And my only one -A quarter to three then -Yes,please You'll be prepared to answer that question if it's put to you? Which question? Oh,about whether he confided his intentions with me or not Certainly Cause Henniker hated my guts since the moment I joined You'll be honest you never wasted much tact on him That's why we are here Come in Excuse me Sir,I thought you'd better have this -But the accused doesn't wear a belt -I know,Sir,for afterward Hallam,you're an incurable optimist Fine piece of leather this Belonged to my father Is it time for Val back? Yes,if she wants to be here when the court reopens There's Henniker now Strutting across the square and he is on his way to torment the regimental office Good Lord,he's showing Sgt. Connolly how to salute In front of the recruit squad he's supposed to be instructing I can't look You ought to do be able to do better than that Don't you know how to keep your wrist straight? Like this,see Now let's see you do it And again That's better,now get on with it -Good bye Larry,thank you so much -Good bye Val Excuse me is Capt. Graham here? -Hello there -Alison,what if you could help me I can try I told Copper I'd come back this afternoon -but I can't face it just hanging around -I can understand that How can I help? Would you tell him,you can say it so he'll understand -You see if I go now I could catch the 2 50 -Have you called a taxi? No,I thought perhaps that you might traveling to the station They won't let me leave the barracks Before six o'clock somehow I'm just going over to transport Ah,Mrs Carrington just the person I'm looking for Oh I'm so sorry,who are you? My name is Evans,Morning Globe What do you want Mr Evans? Just a word with Mrs Carrington nothing to worry her,we shan't publishing anything you don't like We don't want you to publish anything at all But your husband is a public figure They are taken in great deal of interest in this case You can hear the whole story in court I never covered a case yet,Capt. Graham in which the court heard half of the story Take your own evidence for instance the moment you began to interest me you stopped Now this fight this fight in Major Carrington's bedroom of the night he was arrested, I want to hear more about that What fight? The fight between your husband and colonel Henniker what is it about?Who is it about? I'm afraid you've been misinformed,Mr Evans There was no fight Capt. Graham you try to tell me that Col.Henniker got his black eye of a swing door and Major Carrington bathed his knuckles and shut his window -I'm not trying to tell you anything -All right perhaps it happened that way I don't think so,and nor does the mess waiter nor does Col. Henniker's butler -Your train,Valerie,you'll be late -Why haven't I heard about this fight You haven’t heard about it? You haven't heard about it because there wasn't one Mr Evans you have no right go around All right maybe I was wrong maybe it wasn't a fight,I'm sorry Mrs Carrington I must got it wrong Yes,yes perhaps,perhaps you must have I'll phone you in London the moment we hear anything -Oh,yes,please do -You have to hurry now -All right -Good bye,Alison -Bye -And thank you I'm sorry,I'm sorry if I asked the right question the wrong time What did you do then? Then I went up to Major Carrington's quarters Where I found Capt. Graham -And the accused? -Yes The accused was in bed Was he still suffering from the effects of his fall at Sandown? I suppose so When you entered the room what was Capt. Graham doing? She was sitting in a chair In a chair by the bed? No by the window Was she in uniform? Yes Was she fully dressed? Yes Was there anything in their attitude or demeanor that suggested that they've behaving improperly in any way? No What happened then? I pointed out to the accused in having Capt. Graham in his room he was directly disobeying my order And I asked for an explanation Did he give any explanation? No Go on,please Well,he seemed to resent my presence in his quarters Became rather truculent In the end I ordered Capt. Graham to leave the room and I put Mr Carrington under arrest Thank you Col. Henniker,that is all Do you wish to cross examine Major Carrington? Yes,Sir One moment Major Carrington,Sgt. Crane Sir It's a dog,Sir I'm glad we agree -Please silence it -Very good,Sir Sgt. Crane is improving Now then Major Carrington Col.Henniker,let's start with a simple question Can you explain why you dislike me so much? You mean personally or as a battery commander? Personally I don't admit that I do dislike you personally But I've never given that matter much thought No,I think we'll admit we never get on very well Certainly, we have very different views about our army duties for instance Yes we have indeed,let's see how and why We agree that on the 28th of March you told me that you proposed holding a training exercise of my battery staff on the 7th of April I did,your battery staff needed training So badly they couldn't waited one more day? Haven't you known for at least six weeks I was riding at Sandown on the 7th of April? Isn't that a rather an odd way of putting it? Had you applied for leave? No rather stupid perhaps I haven't Do you know how many officers out of your regiment attended that race meting? I have no idea I tell you 18,18 out of 34 you know as well as I do it's a regimental custom You know how many applied for leave officially? I'll tell you not one of them my two fellow battery commander Holt and Mitchell both went Did they ask for leave? I knew they were going My question was did they ask for leave? My answer was not officially but I knew they were going You didn't know I was is t hat what you mean? Yes Do you remember a guest night towards the end of February when we dined the new garrison commander? Yes We sat one on either side of him,didn't we? Yes And discussed at some length my chances of winning the Gold Cup on Peter Pan I don't remember You should,you joined in I can call the garrison commander,you know I don't remember discussing it it is not likely that I would remember it, it's not a subject that would interest me much Let's try another line As a bachelor do you dine in the mess fairly often? Yes,more often than not Were you dining in regularly in the weeks before Royal artillery meeting? Probably I can prove it that you were I can also call four officers who repeat conversation they had with you during that time about my chances in the Gold Cup I don't want waste the time of the court but if you forced me to call them I'll call them Now you still say as late as the 28th March you hadn't heard that I was riding in the Royal Artillery meeting? I may have heard,I probably did but I still say it made no impression on me The moment you told me officially that you meant to ride I told you that you couldn't And I told you why A training exercise for my battery staff arranged 10 days before the meeting for one purpose stopping me riding No,for the better legitimate purpose, increasing the efficiency of your battery I shall ask the court to accept my explanations Mine doesn't suit your case I admit Mine doesn't twist the facts -Gentlemen -I'm sorry,Sir Col. Henniker you started that your remark was provocative I'm sorry,Sir Major Carrington the court will protect you from innuendo You can put away your gun Thank you,Sir Let us go on to the third charge,the one about Capt. Graham's visit to my quarters She's told us herself why she came into room that night can you say why you came? Why I came to your room? At 10 pm,yes please You didn't report your return from hospital that evening I only heard more or less by chance that you were back What time did you hear that? At about nine o'clock in the mess But you didn't come into my room until ten,why? I didn't intend to come at all that night I had plenty to say to you but I decided it was better left till the morning What made you change your mind? I had reason to believe that Capt. Graham had gone to your room What made you think that? I saw her going upstairs for the officer's quarters Why not say so,what time was that? About quarter past nine I should say Quarter past nine so you wired forty five minutes before you followed her? Why? I was hoping she'd come down again and I could have overlooked the matter You hoping that you could overlook a breach of discipline by me, I must square that one Let's take the remaining charge the one about the money Here I admit I behaved very foolishly I gave you a magnificent opening and you took full advantage of it Is that remark in order,Sir? No Major Carrington I don't want to hamper your cross examination but if you can't I'm sorry,Sir Col. Henniker this charge of fraudulent misapplication Let's go back to the 6th of April last about 11 o'clock did I come to your office and talked to you about my finances? Yes Did I tell you that I was unable to meet my debts? Yes Did we discuss the money the government owed me? Yes a subject we'd often discussed before Yes we certainly had When I asked you the paymaster had acknowledge my last letter did you tell me that you hadn't sent it on? Yes,I thought it was a bad letter,rude and exaggerated You didn't say it when I showed it to you? No I only read it later I see Did you refuse that morning once more to take urgent action? I refused to ring up the War Office or to send a series of personal telegrams which was your other suggestion I pointed out that all reasonable steps had already been taken by my staff Did I tell you I was desperate that morning that things had come to a head? You told me at some length about your stepsons school bills and your wife's breakdown in health You appeared to blame me for all that Certainly not as my commanding officer it was your job to help me I had to press my claim through you And I was doing what I could The paymaster was slow but that's nothing new I pointed out that you should have known there would be a delay,manage reserves accordingly Manage my affairs accordingly? Col. Henniker for the last four years I've been kicked around the world never more than six months in anyone station never given government married quarters paying through the nose for furnished rooms and hotels never mind Major Carrington I don't want to keep interrupting you but you have an opportunity to give your evidence later I'm sorry,Sir Let's say we had one more row about the money Now I come to a vital point To me the one point in this whole case that really matters When you told me that you were unwilling or unable to take any further steps on my behalf I told you to that I intended to help myself out of funds do you remember my saying that? No Or anything like that? Nothing at all I vet When I read your evidence of the summary I noticed that you hadn't mention that and thought perhaps you'd overlooked it or didn't think it was important I didn't think that you've might have forgotten it all together I still don't think so You never said any such thing I repeat my very words I said: If they won't pay me I'll pay myself out of funds and see what they'll say to that You don't remember that? No And you won't remember your answer? I actually don't I'll remind you You said: then I shall have great pleasure in seeing you court martial Now,did I make that up? Did I? No Those your exact words weren't they? Yes as far as I can remember,yes Then how is that you don't remember what I said? You're quoting me in the wrong context What do you mean by that? You told me you were going to Sandown the next day with or without my permission And if you did I have you court martialed That speech of yours is the answer to my threat to take the money do you deny that? I do Let's start again The draft which was originally supposed to leave that day didn't come from my battery,did it? No,it was made up equally from the three batteries Exactly but on the morning of the 7th you send the adjutant to my battery office to check to see that the money to pay that draft was still there? I did Did you send the note to the 47th Battery? No Did you send them to the 21st battery? No Then why to the 24th? If you deny I told you I was going to take the money why then my battery and my battery only? Was it my criminal record? No Or my criminal appearance? No Then can you tell the court what made you pick on my battery and my battery only? Certainly Because only in the morning before you told me that you had no money at all And yet at the same evening in the mess I heard you were placing a sizable bet on yourself to win at Sandown I was rather anxious to find out where you got the money to bet with I still want to know what made you think the money came out of my battery safe? That is a difficult question to answer,isn't it? Can I help you? You weren't afraid the money wasn't there but if I told you I was going to take it and you knew damned well it wasn't there But you were afraid that made you to do something quickly I might win at Sandown and put the money back Is that a question? No but this is? Do you still say I didn't tell you that I was going to take the money? I do Then I have only one more question How do like knowing that I know that you are lying? You don't have to answer that Thank you that's all Do you wish to reexamine Major Monson? No thank you,Sir Any questions,Sir? No thank you No Thank you Col.Henniker That concludes the case for the prosecution,Sir Thank you,Major Monson Major Carrington the time has come to you to make your defense you've heard what the prosecution say and you may make your reply in one or several ways you may if you wish but only if you wish give evidence upon oath That's what I want,Sir One moment please or you may make a statement not on oath but I'm bound to warn you that it does not carry the same weight Lastly bearing in mind that it is for the prosecution to prove your guilt and not for you to prove your innocence you may remain silent -Are you sure you understand -Yes,Sir I want to give evidence on oath And do you intend to call any other witnesses? Only one,Sir I intend to call my wife That train is gone the stationmaster swears she wasn't on it She must have missed it, you said she was late starting out Well,why isn't she at the station now, there is another one in twenty minutes I can't understand it just going off without saying a word -But she told Alison -What do we do now? Demand a further adjournment until we find her Shall I remind them in London and leave a message in case she's gone some other way Would you? Kensington 4591 I settle with you later With my girls on the switchboard, the government will stand you that Thank heavens you've come back We're going to be all right What on earth,Val what happens I changed my mind on the way to the station You've heard about the adjournment Oh,yes I went to the court room first Will you give evidence? You did promise you wouldn’t call me I know but things have changed You see Henniker came out with a fat lie gave us an opening which we can't afford to lose -What do you want me to say? -Just tell the court the truth What about? Tell them what I said when I rung you up and told you that I've sent you the hindered pounds But you've taken them from the battery safe? Yes and I told Henniker that I was going to take it and he's threatened to have me court martialed if I did that's all I want from you Valerie,we got to convince the court that Henniker is lying Copper Did you and Henniker had a fight that night? Of a sort,yes So you did What about? Well among other he said some things about Alison that I didn't very much like so I called him a liar a dirty minded snooper and he didn't very much like that Go on,tell me what happened Well,he sort of slapped at me and I lost my temper and knocked him down It wasn't much of a fight really wouldn't have filled the Albert Hall And you where there? Yes People have all the luck I wish I'd seen it What was he said about you? You know the sort of things he'd say He thought he'd ventured into an amorous scene Oh,no even Henniker couldn't have thought that He started up again about the time he got stranded on our way back from Manover Did I hear about that? Yes,you heard about that In February,remember? On our way back from Command Conference when we got snowbound and spend the night in the pub Oh,yes I remember I don't see the connections You wouldn't but Henniker thought that he did Copper,we'd better get back, we're holding things up Yes do you want to go the mess and have tea I haven't given my evidence yet Oh no I'll wait here with Alison I take down to my quarters you'll be more comfortable there That's a good idea,thank you for coming back Your hands are like ice are you sure that you're all right? I'm fine Don't worry about won't take more than two and three minutes Even if they cross examined Force of habit BTW don't talk to me talk to the old boy in the wig Coming dear? Yes I took this money but I took it openly, I was saying I was going to take it I took it to advertise a grievance Openly to advertise a grievance? Well,Major Carrington,let's see if you did After your interview with Col. Henniker that morning you went back to your office borrowed the key of the safe from Bombardier Owen -and took out 125£ -Yes -Did anyone see you take it? -No If you tell Bombardier Owen you've taken it? No -Not even when you gave him back the key? -Not even then Did you tell any of your fellow officers that you've taken it? I didn't tell Bombardier Owen or anyone else having a row with my commanding officer because I didn't want to stir up feeling against him That would seem to me to be rather cheap Surely does your credit Major Carrington but to someone who wanted to advertise grievance don't you think you were going remarkably reticent? Even secretive? I told Col. Henniker that I was going to take the money The Court has heard Col. Henniker deny that I also told Capt.Graham she doesn't deny it You told her you had a row with him Wasn't that cheap? Yes I think it was This advertising when was it going to start? When were you're going to tell anyone you've taken this money? As soon as the order to pay the draft came through I was going to ring up the regimental office and tell Col. Henniker that the cupboard was bare I was rather looking forward to that Meanwhile you said nothing to anyone Except my wife Sorry I've been so long now I've organized tea it'll be here in a moment Giving evidence is nothing,Valerie, certainly won't be for you They know you've been ill they're be telling themselves no matter what they do they mustn't upset you Come in Thank you so much Tell me how did you and Copper happen to go to Manover? We were ordered to go,it was a conference Just you two? No five us went it was Copper, Mary and I,Doc Mc Kenzie and Col. Henniker Did you all get stranded? -No,sugar? -No thank you We were on our way back it was snowing The other three were hid in the Col.'s car and and Copper and I was in his And the driver of course Yes go on Well,going up on a weird Welsh slope, the car started to cough It stopped nothing let it ever start again So we had to go backward hill to the bottom Fortunately there was a village or at least a pub Fortunately Well,when it got dark it was still snowing the driver was still tinkering with the car So we all stayed the night Where was this? A little place called,Polgethnig, "Tremarthern Arms" Don't ever go there,the landlord doesn't like visitors I said my bed was damped so in revenge they put me in room with a bat in it bat came to life when I went to bed between us we knocked over parasol-lamp and moved the furniture Copper had to come and rescue me Did he get rid of the bat? Yes,I left him he had to get rid of the landlord too And then his way back to bed Yes To his own bed? Val,what's wrong with you? Did you not think I wouldn't know the moment I saw you together? There's nothing to know You are all on edge I'll tell you what happened that night and save you the trouble of lying about it -Val,let's stop this -I'll stop it when I get the truth Until then I refuse to go into that court room You can't do that to him Tell Copper I've gone back to London and tell him why All right We did spend that night together But only that night and that's all that was to it You tell who was to blame and end of that and it did It led nowhere,never could have led anywhere Copper loves you He always has And I suppose he always will He certainly doesn't love me Nor you him I suppose Oh,yes I love him But that needn't worry you You would never had known if you hadn't left him So it's all my fault It's no one's fault It's the way things are Heaven know I've change them if I could Come in Excuse me,Ma'am,they are asking for Mrs Carrington Thank you Val You won't hold it against him will you? And don't stay away from him again he'll so lonely and miserable, he doesn’t care what happens you won't do that,will you? Val -I swear by Almighty God -I swear by Almighty God that the evidence which I shall give before this court that the evidence which I shall give before this court shall be the truth,the whole truth and nothing but the truth shall be the truth,the whole truth and nothing but the truth -Sgt. Crane -Sir Get Mrs Carrington a chair By the table -All right -Yes I won't keep you long.. One moment Major Carrington we have to establish the identity of the witness Oh yes I'm sorry You are Mrs Valerie Diana Carrington and my wife,aren't you? I am On the 6th April last where were you? In London To the court,Val In London Did you get a telephone call from me that afternoon? About 3 o'clock Yes Can you remember what is was all about? Yes I think so Can you tell the court quite shortly what we said to each other? About the money you mean? Yes,start with the money You said you just told your bank to send me 100£ Yes I think I asked you were you got it,didn't I? Yes,you did You said you've taken it from the battery safe Go on I didn't believe you I think I told you were mad Yes,but what did I say? I don't remember I know I told you to go and put it back at once I begged you to Yes -You said you wouldn’t -Yes Yes,Val,and then what did I say? Did I mention Col. Henniker? We talked for sometime Yes Do you remember what I said about Col. Henniker? Try to think,this is important Didn't I tell you that I had differences of opinion with Col. Henniker? No,really we can't have that You mustn't lead the witness Major Carrington Did we talk about Col.Henniker No I don't think we mentioned him What's this Val? I don't think so,I can't remember You can't remember what? I can't remember what it is you wanted me to say I simply want you to tell the truth what I said,is that so difficult? I am telling the truth Are you telling this court on oath you don't remember one word I said about my row with Col. Henniker? No I don't You know what you are doing? Yes and I still don't remember It's all,Sir,no more questions -Do you wish to cross examine Major Monson? -No,Sir Mrs Carrington Your husband has told this court upon oath that he warned Col. Henniker that he meant to take the money from his battery safe and he called you with apparent confidence to support that statement please put right out of your mind any discussion you may have had with him about your evidence but are you sure he did not tell you on the telephone that he had said that to Col.Henniker? Quite sure Any questions? May I reexamine,Sir? On the question of what you told your wife? -Yes,Sir -Certainly That same day presumably a short time after we spoke together on the telephone you sat down and you wrote me a letter Yes In this letter among other things you refer to the money I sent you Yes I acknowledge it You also referred to a row I had with Col. Henniker What row? The row I had with Col.Henniker when I told him I was going to take the money out of the safe I didn't mention Col. Henniker or your row with him How could I when I didn't know anything about it Major Carrington are you producing that letter? I'm just going to quote parts of it If you're going to quote from the letter it must be produced for the inspection of the court I doubt my wife would think that fair Major Carrington is that all? Yes,Sir,that's all Any questions? Tank you Mrs Carrington that's all Val Hold it please,thank you And finally,gentlemen I remind you that I am your adviser of matters of procedure and the Law But you and you alone are judges of the facts and now,Sir I leave it to your deliberations Court orderly,clear the court Well,gentlemen If we find Carrington guilty of a charge involving fraud,Sir he'll have to be dismissed or cashiered won't he? Or sent to prison That is for us to decide if and when we find him guilty At the moment we're considering the verdict And the question of what sentence may follow should not effect our decision in any way Shouldn't be difficult for them to decide who to believe Mr Deaf,Dumb and Blind and Stupid Henniker may get away with murder in the witness box but he's not going to get away trying to teach me how to salute in the middle of the barracks square That's right,Sgt.,you sort him out, and then you'd left your stripes like us They wanted to send someone tomorrow but I said Friday would be better Or next week I suggested Monday subject to your approval What did you say? I firmly believe that Carrington did warn Henniker that he was going to take the money Col.Henniker swears he didn't -Will you believe him? -Yes why should he lie Why on earth should he? What's he get out of it? -May I? -I should that have thought was obvious The old story of the backroom boy versus a regimental officer Anyone who had fighting in the late contest starts off on the wrong foot with Henniker Carrington V.C. would make him see red His popularity with the troops would make him see redder Are you serious? I think he goes so far to perjury himself? No need to call it perjury by this time his version is probably the only one he believes Well,I don't mind calling it perjury Look we found Carrington guilty of absence without leave and improperly entertaining the girl at least you all found him guilty I didn't but I still say that no sane and balanced commanding officer would have put up a man like Carrington for court martial on emotive charges that's why I don't believe one word he said about this one In other words you're saying I don't care what he did but I don't like his commanding officer You beastly about (?)I'll vote not guilty You could put it that way if it amuses you That's nonsense the Colonel had to put him up for court martial he couldn't do anything else Look, Carrington said he had good reasons to take the money Who hasn't? Who hasn't been swindled and sat down by the blasted treasurer ever since he joined the service,I know I have but I haven't paid myself back out of the safe not yet Carrington's story doesn't hold water anywhere Look at that 125£ he says he took 100 £ and sent to his wife and 25£ to bet with That was an afterthought spit in the eye for the paymaster An afterthought? 25 £ was just about what he needed to let him put the whole lot back if he'd won Does sounds like an afterthought? You're going on talking as if he sat down weeks before and worked it all out but he didn't he was in trouble over money he was in trouble over his wife He had a flaming row with Henniker he went up in smoke I don't say he wasn't a fool but I'm certain he isn't a thief Hear,hear,hear Gentlemen,gentlemen,gentlemen The more you talk the more you wonder Major Carrington had admitted taking the money Prosecution claims he took it secretly and dishonestly if you believe that then he's guilty of fraudulent misapplication as charged Carrington says he took it openly but chose to advertise his wrongs if you believe that the he is not guilty It is simple as that Now I shall review the testimony of the wife -Can I come in? -Do Anything happened yet? No nothing Copper I must talk to you? Do you mind,Jim? Well,don't run away,Copper,I'll be outside She found out about us,didn't she? Yes I did my best but she knew, there was no way to warn you Copper,what if it goes against you? I don't know What about Valerie? Val and I are through How can you say that when you were willing to chuck away your whole career just to save her face? That wasn't to save her face Then why? Why did you do it? You know I'm no good at saying why or why not In this whole business tearing up that letter is one thing I do wish I'm quite sure I'll never regret It was like paying off a debt something I owed -To Val? -Yes Not being the man the newspaper told her I was when we married The gallant V.C. with a brilliant career ahead of him in the army That's not being someone who could take the place of the man she ever really did love The one who was killed before he had time to disappoint her -Copper -I'm not blaming Val She never pretended,she even warned me So now all I had to do stop thinking I can't live without her and proof to myself that I can After all I had plenty of practice lately Copper I'm not forgetting that I made most of the running But would you have spent that night with me if you would still be in love her? I am not as innocent as that sounds, lots would I know But not you At least I never thought so I must go I'm on duty Copper Down there in Polgethnig you said there was was no future in it for us No I said an affair wasn't good enough for you That's not the same thing That's what I thought you said I I'll be late But he could have proved his wife was lying by producing the letter But he didn't produce it -He tore it up -Yes Because he didn't want to show her up for what she is -A liar and... -No romantic nonsense chaps you're making it up people don't behave like that nowadays Not enough of them I grant you When they stop all together it'll be a bad day for the world We can all start running for the nearest sugar Your guess maybe right It's quite possible that Carrington's decision reflect great credit on him But I don't think he can escape its consequences Listen to this from the manual A member of court martial must remember that their findings must be based upon the evidence given before them The word evidence is in italics Now a letter that is not produced is not evidence And I am sure that any court of law and court martial is a court of law which decided that the accused could have proved his case but didn't and yet acquitted him is on very dangerous ground we've sworn to try Carrington without partiality favor or affection Let's be sure with that And now remembering that in a court martial a majority verdict is sufficient I'll take your votes Guilty or not guilty of the charge of fraudulent misapplication Major Broke-Smith Not guilty,Sir Major Panton Guilty,Sir Guilty,Sir Not guilty,Sir A verdict depending on my word Major Charles R Porter Carrington V.C.,DSO,Royal Artillery The court found that you were guilty of the first charge guilty of the second charge and guilty of the third charge These findings are subject to confirmation You'd better have this Jim instead of that tin of yours You're still wanted What for? Fancy dress? Nonsense,sentence has to be confirmed How did it go? What happened to him? What did he get? Reprimand or what? What did he get? Dismiss of service Dismissed? They should have some of us up there as witnesses Well,I'd never thought I lived to see the day when I felt sorry for an officer Of course he didn't stand a chance not after that bee of is wife told them he never mentioned Henniker's name on the phone that morning Couldn't they tell she was lying? Court can't tell anything, they have to be told Your London call Cap.Fischer I've could have told them "clayshott barracks one moment please" Told them what? I put that call through to Major Carrington I heard him Heard him what? That he told Col. Henniker that he was going to take that money Michie Well,I wasn't listening I was just taking the line Do you realize what you are saying? I just come along to see you is there anything I could do? I don't think so but thank you for coming Copper you're going to fight this aren't you? -Fight it? -Appeal against their verdict and sentence Oh that's a waste of time from what I heard in that court they are bound to find me guilty and kick me out If you appeal they will have another look at the evidence Yes and the appeal court might have more sense than this one I can't think of one reason why they should Let's forget about the whole thing No Copper that's not good enough Why not? When these things started you said you were glad because you thought the case might do some good -Did I? -Yes,it was to advertise grievance Just as you said in court I can play the advertising didn't I? It so happened one of those times that advertising didn't pay That's to be the end of it Honestly I don't know Copper,please,all I want you to do is to say that you won't give up Even if they do confirm the sentence you'll go on fighting Let's talk about it some other time Capt Graham Excuse me Ma'am -What is it Greta? -Could I have a word with you a moment? -Now? -It's important,Ma'am I think you should hear what Patti Smith just told me Beg you pardon,Sir I know you don't want me just now,but some of the battery asked me to have a word with you,Sir That's all right,Owen Well,Sir Take lucky to know that there is not one last joined recruit that don't know better than that court martial as a matter of fact there's a movement to let the Col.. know what we think of him as a start of it For heavens sake stop that I know,Sir,Sgt. made a shot on that But there's nothing to prevent me to telling you what I think Of all the damned idiotic mess I had come across in 12 year army service that's plenty,that verdict and that sentence is just about tops the lot Well,that's they think,Sir,and we would like you to know That's all,Sir -Thank you Sgt Owen,Bombardier Owen -Gunner Owen,Sir -What -Well,that's what it will be I met the Adjutant on the way over and we had a word or so on the line I just told about Owen I know Sir,I'm under open arrest again but don't you worry I'll be monies worth this time Good luck,Sir The Major All right I'll lodge my appeal Subtitles by Nostromo
