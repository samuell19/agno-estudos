(applause) (slow music) (squeals) - [Narelle] We can't go back to bed now. - [Billy] (kisses) Okay. - [Narelle] Honey, I just got the job, they'll sack me if I'm late. - [Billy] They love it. Bet I can make you stay. - [Narelle] Bet you can't. (laughing) (blows raspberry) - I'll call your boss and tell her you're sick and I'll do all your typing for you. - You liar. - I don't tell lies. Not big ones. - Shower. (kisses) Now! - Wait, just one more. (laughing) No? (kissing) - Billy, I love you. - Well, of course you do. Because I can do this. (kissing) (slow music) - You want another coffee? - No thanks. - Pancake? Juice? I could get you some juice. - No, thank you. What are you doing today? - Oh, same old. Gotta go to the store. My mom wants me to send her more of those koala purse things. - Nice. - What? They're cute. What time will you be home? - Eight. - Eight? Hayden! - Brittney, I can't do anything about it. Got to get this report out by Friday. - Great, so I don't get to see you all week! You know I can't eat late, it upsets my stomach. (slow music) - You're looking spiffy. Sweetie, you'll have to stand up straight otherwise you'll get creases by the first commercial break, okay? - We done? - Yes. Beautiful. Oh my god! (laughs) Beautiful. (kisses) You are so naughty. - Why? - I thought you'd forgotten! - I'm not gonna forget after last year's anniversary. Come on. - Yeah, but you got up this morning and you didn't say anything. - Because I was asleep like most normal people. - Oh. They're beautiful. So are we going out tonight? - Standby. - Oh yes! - Okay, here we go in 10, nine-- (mumbles) - Why? - Conrad doesn't like any of his jackets. And he doesn't fit into his shirt. He's putting on the weight again. But I got my own back. - How? - The tie. - [Announcer] Good morning and welcome to the Today Show. It certainly is a chilly one out there, so I hope you've got your thermals on, Carla. - [Carla] Yes, I have and... (slow music) - After school tomorrow, can I go to Amy's house? - [Vicky] I'll have to speak with Amy's mum. I wouldn't be able to pick you up until after dinner, I've got to work late. - Again? - Should be done by five, I could pick her up. Can you grab my shirts from the dry cleaner's? - [Claire] Yeah, Daddy, can we go shopping? - No, I've got a conference call at seven and then we're in court at 10. Can your mum do it? - I don't know, give her a call. - Please don't put your fingers in that, Claire. - Claire, come on. That's not very ladylike, is it? - [Vicky] She's engaged. - Aren't you taking her to school? - No. - Okay, Claire, Daddy's taking you to school this morning. - [Vicky] Don't forget your lunch, sweetheart. - Where's my lunch? - Here. - See you, love. - (kisses) Bye, darling. (slow music) - What the hell? Jesus, Julie. You've gotta be more bloody careful! - I was trying to make you eggs. Isn't that what I'm supposed to do, cook your fucking meals? - Why don't you get Jacinta to give you a hand? - Oh, yeah, right. Like that little cow would help me with anything. - Jacinta! - Spoiled little bitch! - [Bob] Oh, shut up, Julie. Jacinta! - Shut up, Bob. You know, you don't know anything as usual. Just piss off to work. You don't know what it's like being here with her day in and day out. - Hey, will you just calm down? - Let me go! - Just calm down and go-- (muffled arguing) - [Julie] Let go of me! - [Bob] Alright, just settle down! You're hysterical. Go have a lay down. - Looks like I'm coming over to your place, doesn't it? - It does. - Okay. (kisses) I gotta go. - Wait, just one more, just one more. (kisses) Bye. - I'll go in. - Ben. - I know, later. - Okay. I love you! - Look, I don't know what's going on and I don't bloody care. Just fix it, and fix it now! And pull your bloody finger out. We can't afford to lose these guys. Jesus. - Well, no wonder, it's not even the right draft! Silly old fart. (phone rings) Yes? - That bad, mate? Think you should just chuck it in and go straight to the pub. - Can't, mate, sorry. - So what gives? It's been ages. We thought you'd have been at the reunion. - I know, sorry. Britts wasn't feeling up to it and I've been flat out at work. - Well, we wanted to invite you both over for dinner on Thursday night. Can you make it? - That should be fine. Actually, can we make it Friday? - [Anthony] Yeah, probably. - That'd be great, please. Because Brittney has booked us in to have this colonic irrigation. - Oh my god, colonic irrigation. What do they do exactly, shove a-- - Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know. And I've gotta get out of it. To tell you the truth, I could do with a night off on my own as well. - Yeah, whatever, mate. But you know she's most welcome. I just have to talk to Vick, otherwise I have to cook and that would not be good for anyone's colon. - (laughs) It's been too long. I'll check with Britts. I'll see you Friday. - Yeah, take care, mate. See you then. - I hope you don't mind me butting in but I noticed that you don't eat. So tomato, salad, cheese. No meat. - You brought me lunch. Trying to impress me on the first week? - No, no, I just thought that while I was out-- - I'm teasing, it's great. Thank you. - I finished typing your letters, so I'll email them after lunch. - Narelle, is that a trashy mag you've got hidden between those folders? - Yeah. - For god's sake, give it to me. (laughs) Sit down. - Do you ever go out? - I'm on this blood type diet. To be healthy, not to lose weight. - I'm always on a diet! But I've never heard of that one though. - Narelle, you're not really on a diet, are you? You're like size six. - You know, never happy with the way you look. - Please, you look fabulous. What's your secret? - Oh, it's boring for everyone else, I'm sure. - I've been working on the same contract for six hours. Please. - Okay. I'm in love! His name is Billy and we met at the gin palace four weeks ago! - They all want me, I'm just giving them what they want. You should watch and learn. - I'd love to watch a master at work, but I'm too busy making money. - So you want to go to the footie Friday night? - Yeah, (mumbles). I hope you are ready for some serious pain. Hey, I know a guy who can get us box seats. - No, the outer's better. Be back in a tick. That thing is a complete bastard, only holds about 30 sheets at a time. Can I give you a hand? - Thanks. I've gotta get these back quickly. - We just couldn't keep our hands off each other from that first night. Been either his place or mine ever since. - God, I feel old. I wouldn't be able to get up in the morning. In fact, I probably wouldn't be able to move at all. - He wants to do things I've never even heard of! Well, actually... There's more food involved in our lovemaking than any diet I've ever been on. (laughs) Sorry! - No, you go for it. Sounds great. No wonder you're not eating. - I should get to work. - Me too. - Thanks for letting me gush. I'm just really excited. - Don't worry, it's fine. I do remember what it's like, you know. - Of course. Thanks. - So be involved, be amused, before you even get in the car. - Join us for the Today Show, tomorrow morning and every morning at 7:00 a.m. - Stupid bitch. (knocking) - [Shane] Hello, anyone home? - Hey, gorgeous. It's about time you dropped over. - Hey. (kisses) You look as stunning as ever. - I love how much of a liar you are, Shane. I look like shit. Where have you been? Haven't seen you this week. - You know, Bob and his new training hours. The application's got me up to my ears in paperwork. - As if he'd tell me. I'm only his wife. - Yeah, well, whose fault's that? - Want a drink? - [Shane] Sure. - Hey, why don't you come for dinner tomorrow night? Do a roast. What do you say? - [Shane] Hey Jas, how's school? - What are you doing here? - It's Tuesday. - Beer and pool. - Yeah, Dad's never home till six and you're always early. Wonder why. - Jacinta, why don't you try showing Shane a bit of respect? You've known him all your life, huh? - It's okay, Jules. I remember when we were that age. - Trouble is, you still both behave like you're 15. - It's okay. - No, you apologize to Shane or go to your room. - Fine, I will go to my room. - Hello everyone. You ready? - Yeah. I'll see you in the car, mate. - Oh, bugger off then. - I'll see you later. - [Anthony] Is that new? - No, you gave it to me for our third anniversary. - Oh yeah. (kissing) So does this mean no more Teletubbies nightie? - (laughs) It's in the wash. Claire's still wearing hers. (kissing) - Vick. Vick. I'm so sorry. I'm just tired and stressed and the last thing I feel is... - Well, why don't you relax and maybe I can try to. - No, don't. I love holding you and kissing you. I love you. You know it's not your fault, right? - Yes. - Please don't think you have to please me. It's not your fault, it's me. - This isn't just about you. Have you thought about the fact that I'm feeling horny? Doesn't matter. - I'm sorry. - Don't say sorry, you don't mean to. - I feel like-- I feel-- This is terrible. It's bloody pathetic. - Well, do you want to talk to someone about it? It helped after we talked last time. - No, it's nothing like that. If I got a decent assistant and stopped taking on so much, I know I'd be fine. - [Vicky] I don't believe you. You said that last time. - Talking about it's not gonna help! - So how's everything going? - It's gotten to the stage now where I can't even face going home. And Julie's just... I mean, I don't know what to do anymore. And Jacinta, she's gonna leave home as soon as she can. - Why do you say that? - Do you blame her? - Your shot. Cheers. - Listen, mate, I want to ask you something. I know we've touched on this before, but nothing's ever panned out. But I reckon the time is right now. How do you feel about becoming a partner in the business? - Shit. - Mate, your store's doing well. You know the business, your figures prove that. And you'd be helping me out big time. - That's certainly been a long time coming, mate. - Yeah, I know. But this time we're actually gonna draw up the papers. Mate, I know you're more than capable. But if you don't wanna commit yourself, I understand. - No. - Don't you have any pressure on. If you want to sleep on it? - Yeah, right. - Well, go ahead. Your shot. Partner. (upbeat music) - No, I'm really tired. - Oh, come on, just one more dance, come on. - I have to be at work at five. And you've gotta work too. - I wanna stay. - Surprise surprise. - Come on, we talked about this. - I know. Have fun. (kisses) Don't do anyone I wouldn't do. ♫ You're getting nearer ♫ I can hear your heartbeat ♫ Move a little bit closer ♫ Come a little bit closer to me ♫ I can feel you ♫ I'm running, you're running ♫ We don't know where ♫ We're dancing, we're moving as close as we can ♫ I'm falling, you're falling into the stars above ♫ This is such a crazy feeling ♫ Could this be love? - Excuse me. This drink is compliments of Mr. West and he would like you to join him in the den. (laughs) - Conrad. What a surprise. What are you doing here? - Oh, I just came for a drink. And a watch. - Cheers. - You're here alone, Mitchell. Where's your hubby? Does he know you're out on a school night, dancing your little ass off? - Oh yeah, he knows. He's just gone home, that's all. - [Conrad] Oh, how boring. - He's not boring. He's professional. He's gone home to bed so he can get up early to make you look good. - But the point is you're not at home in bed with him, are you? You're here with me. - [Mitchell] That's because you bought me a drink, you cheeky bastard. - (laughs) Well, I would have bought your friend one, but didn't know his name. - Neither do I. I'm not into prepubescent. - Oh, I thought you were into Danny. - Oh, I am. Very. - What are you doing here then? - I don't know. You tell me. (kissing) - Well? (kissing) (screams) - Narelle, honey, you scared me. What the-- Look, maybe you should go. - Yeah, right. Dickhead. - What are you doing here? - Who's she? - [Billy] How did you get in? - You gave me a spare key. - I didn't give you a spare key. I did not give you a spare key. - You told me that it was under the pot plant and I could use it anytime. Who was she? - She's nobody. She's just somebody I met at work. - I thought you loved me. - I never lied about that. - Well, what was that? - What is this? What the fuck are you thinking? Why'd you have to go and fuck this up? - Do you know how disgusting I feel right now? Another girl has seen me like this. - No, she doesn't mean anything to me. I do love you. I just don't know if I'm in love with you. That's just who I am. It's how I am. - Well, you're an asshole. - Look great in the underwear. (Narelle crying) - [Conrad] No, no. - What the hell's going on? - No. - Oh, for god's sake. Here. - That smells. Why do you always have to give me shirts that smell? I thought washing was genetic for you. - It's a brand new shirt, store sent it over especially. I really don't understand what's wrong-- You know I don't have to wash personals, Mr. West. - Oh, for god's sake, just do it. Not like you got anything more important to do. I, on the other hand, have got to go to an appointment. - Oh yeah? Who's the unlucky guy? (laughs) - Mr. West, the driver's waiting to take you to your lawyer. - Oh, everything peachy, Conrad? - Oh, shut up. (laughs) Oh yeah, we'll see who's laughing last, o Danny boy. - Okay, so basically a flower is a sexual organ. Yeah, very funny, get your laughing out. - Sir? - [Mitchell] Yes, Danny? - Is that a man or a woman? - Oh, well, actually it's both, Danny. Little bit like you. No, they're actually called hermaphrodites. - Hey Jacinta, Scott says you're frigid. I reckon I could sort you out. - [Mitchell] Quiet please. - How bout it, Cin? Want to suck my dick? - Shut up. - Oh, what's the matter? You never seen one before? Got a better idea. How about I just let you sit on my face-- (shouts) - Jacinta! Daniel, go to Mr. Pittard's office right now. - I didn't do nothing to her, she just hit me. - Yeah, well, you're as innocent as Mother Teresa. Move it. Jacinta, can you go and wait in my office, please? Right, do you think we can get this done before someone ends up in sickbay? - Narelle, what's going on? You look like shit, you haven't been at your desk all morning, I've been answering phones. Now, if you're sick, you should just take the day off. It's bad for clients to see you like this. Narelle? What's the matter? What's happened? - It's Billy. It's over. - Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that. - I went to his house to surprise him in the new underwear that he sent me. And he came home with some chick from work. And he says that he can't stop having affairs but that it shouldn't affect our relationship. - Narelle, this guy is fuckwit. You know that, don't you? - But I love him! - Okay. I think you should just go home and have a good cry. - No, I'll be alright. I'll just-- - Narelle, you're no good to me here and this client's case is a little delicate, so I think it would be better for everyone if you just went home and got yourself together and came into work first thing tomorrow. - I just really needed to talk to someone. And I've been trying to get the courage to talk to you all day. - Just go home. - Oh, I'm sorry. I feel like such an idiot. - You're not an idiot. - Could I come over to your house and talk? - No. I mean, yes. I'm cooking dinner tomorrow night. Why don't you come round early and we'll have a chat then. - Thanks. That'd be great. - Sorry to make you wait, my PA isn't feeling well. I've had to send her home. - Can we get on with it? - Of course. ♫ A quiet tomorrow ♫ I dwell upon a memory of love - Smartie? All your teachers are worried about you. You don't talk to anyone, you don't do any work, you don't like anything except boxing maybe. Jacinta, you can't go around beating up fellow students. - Danny Lewis is a disgusting pervert and deserves everything he gets. - Yes, he's quite disgusting and probably incurably stupid, but I never thought you were. You wanna talk about it? Come on, we used to be friends, you and I. You're one of my best students. Don't you think punching him is rather immature? - Yeah, could have used a bat. - Oh dear. It's all part of being in high school, you know. Being picked on. Losing your childhood innocence can be really hard. Believe me, I know. But being an adult means knowing when to rise above it all. - What about when it's not your fault? What happens then, sir? - Well, Jacinta, I don't know. But it doesn't sound good. Is it something at home? Jacinta. Anytime you want to talk about this, doesn't have to be now, but when you're ready, I'd really like to help you, okay? Okay? Okay. No, no, no, I didn't mean-- No, no, no, no, no, come back and sit down. Jacinta-- - So things are looking good for your extended trading application. Just waiting on hearing from the department-- - [Bob] That's great, Anthony. I'm sure you're doing everything you can. I actually came here to talk about something else I want you to do for me. - Sure, fire away. - I wanted to rearrange my assets. - [Anthony] What did you have in mind? - I want to leave my shares to my business partner Shane and my daughter Jacinta. And I want to remove Julie as a beneficiary from the family trust. - But that would leave her with nothing. - Well, she'd still have the house if anything were to happen to me. - Yes, but no shares in the business or income, how would she live? - Well, Shane would look after her. - [Anthony] What do you mean? - Well, Shane can only take over my share of the business if he looks after Julie. - But we could just set it up so the money goes straight to her. - You don't understand, Anthony. Look, my wife, she can't be alone. She's terrible with money. She needs someone to look after her. - Listen, mate, I'm not sure where this is coming from, but you do know it sounds like you're saying you want to leave your wife to your best friend? I think this has some potential problems. - Anthony, I just want you to make sure that Jacinta has as much money as she needs. Anything she wants. - Sure, we can set up a trust fund, whatever you want. And you can always change your mind. I don't think you're going anywhere just yet, Bob. - I can't believe you're doing this. Do you know how hard it was to get the appointment in the first place? - Baby, you can still go. I just promised these people I'd go to dinner. - What, so you'd rather have me go all by myself just so you can have dinner with your friends? - Would I rather see people I haven't seen in six months or have a high-pressure hose inserted into my rectum? Hmm, let me think. - This is for your health, Hayden! I'm not just doing this for myself! God. Why don't you want to spend any time with me anymore? Did they even invite me to dinner? - Yes. - Oh, so it's you who doesn't want me there. Can't wait to get away from me. You're probably having an affair for all I know and you're off with your friends to laugh about how stupid I am not to know about it! - Brittney! How can you say that? I really don't want to have my colon irrigated. I'm sorry, I know it's important to you and I think you should still go. I just want to see these people that are important to me. I'm going now. Won't be late. - I knew guys like that at uni. And believe me, Narelle, it's better to find out now because they never change. You've done the right thing and don't let him try and talk you out of it. - What time is it? - Like a quarter to. Maybe you should give them a call. And can you just check that Brittney isn't coming? I haven't set a place for her. That's probably enough to send her into therapy for a month. - He'll be here. And he definitely said he was coming alone. (doorbell rings) - So who's Hayden? - We all went to uni together. But we haven't seen much of him the last couple of years. I think Brittney has-- Hi. - Hi gorgeous. Something smells good. Sorry I'm so late. Peace offering. - Oh, they're beautiful. Thank you. See, Anthony, Hayden knows how to give a girl flowers. - I've no idea why flowers make everything alright. You just got them down the road. - Well, I did have a nice bottle of red for you but you can get stuffed, I'll give it to your wife instead. - Yeah, that'd be right. Oh, Hayden, this is Narelle. - Hi. - Hello. Sorry to hold up dinner. Had no idea there'd be real people here. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - [Mitchell] She completely covered her desk in black (mumbles). She punched another student in the head. - [Danny] Charming. - It's like she can't communicate properly, so she expresses herself physically. She even did it with me. - What, she punched you? - No, she kissed me. - She kissed you? Really? - Yeah, I don't know what it was about. - Did you like it? - No. - You did, didn't you? - No, Danny, I'm serious! - You're turning straight on me. You're every schoolgirl's fantasy. - I'm really worried about her. Do you think I should visit the mum? - No, I wouldn't talk to her. If she's this crazy, imagine what her mum's like. - Danny, she's just a kid. I used to talk to her all the time. (phone rings) (pats) - It's your turn. Such a brute. - [Mitchell] Hello? - I was counting on you answering the phone. I've missed you. You miss me? - Conrad, how are you? - What have you gone and done that for? Now Danny knows it's me, you've spoiled all my fun. - Do you want to talk to him? - (laughs) You know it's you I want. - No, he's in the bathroom. - Meet me at the club tonight. I've got something for you. - Look, do you want to leave a message or you'll just see him at work tomorrow? - Are you going to meet me tonight? - I'll just tell him you called, nothing important. - Are you going to meet me tonight? - No, that's okay. That's fine. Bye. - What the hell's he calling us at home for? - Don't know. Just wanted to talk to you. - That's weird. - (laughs) It was the last stop at the pub crawl and Anthony hadn't quite made it yet because he now had the grass skirt wrapped around his head and was doing the conga up and down Smith Street. Vicky, meanwhile, was passed out in front of a DJ booth and had lost both her shoes. - You tell that to anyone at work, you're fired. - Please tell someone at work. I'll hire you. I was on the dance floor, doing my best Peter Garrett impersonation-- - Which is bloody terrible. - Slipped and broke my leg. - Oh my god! - Yeah, well, luckily my friend Nick was still conscious seeing as both of my housemates at the time couldn't do a thing. Oh my god, that reminds me, I didn't tell you. Did you hear Sarah has left Nick and run off with one of the guys she works with? - I knew it! You hear that, Vick? Everyone always treated Nick like he was the biggest asshole in the world, but she's the one who did the dirty. It's unbelievable. - What, asshole. He's been cheating on her for years. Since uni. And you know that as well as I do. Good on her, I say. - Yeah, good on her, she's just walked out on her family. - Well, at least she's being honest about telling him that she's met someone else and leaving. It's not the same. - An affair is an affair no matter how it's wrapped up. She's as bad as him. Right, Hayden? - [Hayden] No, I think if it's got to the point where your partner wants to be with someone else and you don't know about it, it's got to be over, right? - How could you not know? - Sometimes you don't want to see the bad in a person. Then even when you do start to see the signs, you beg excuses because you love them. - Well, I admire Sarah's strength. Sometimes it's harder to leave than it is to stay. - So when a woman has an affair, she's strong. But when a man has an affair, he's an asshole. - Oh god, the world is so black and white for you, isn't it? - We all know what the rules are, how the lines are drawn. - [Vicky] Not everyone draws lines in the same places. - What do you mean? - Well, for some people, being unfaithful is looking longingly at someone across a crowded room and for others everything is okay, even having sex with someone else as long as you didn't say "I love you." - Yeah, like who? People on this planet? - So how do you know who draws what where? - Well, that's the trick, to find a partner whose parameters are the same as yours. - And finding friends that won't judge you if their relationship is working under different guidelines. - Excuse me, the point is that Nick and Sarah's relationship isn't working. It's much simpler if we're all reading the same book. - Shut up and wash up. - [Claire] Mommy, what's an affair? - [Vicky] What are you doing out of bed? - I can't sleep. - Well, hardly surprising, seeing as Uncle Hayden and Daddy are very noisy. - Hey, kiddo. Didn't wake you up, did I? Ow. Oh, you got me. Maybe it's time I was in bed too. I should get back to Brittney. - I should get going too. I'll call a cab. - Oh, where are you off to? - Elwood. - I'll give you a lift. - Oh, really? Oh, no, thanks. - It's fine. - [Vicky] Yeah, let him drive you. - Okay, thanks. That would be great. - When I was safe, sane, and single as they say. - [Narelle] Oh, you look pretty safe to me. - Damn, here I was trying to be cool and impress you. (phone beeps) Your phone has been going off all night. It's a persistent one. - That's my boyfriend. Or my ex. Whatever. But I had a much better night with you guys! - Glad to hear it. - Yeah. Yes, well, thank you very much for the lift. - You're welcome. - I appreciate it. - I hope to see you again at another Vicky and Anthony function? - Yes, me too. Bye. - Bye bye. - (kisses) Was a beautiful dinner, darling. Kiss for Daddy? (kisses) - Come on. (crying) (door closes) - Hey. You're okay. - I just feel so alone. I miss my mum. - I know you do. You should go visit her. - No, I don't want to go unless you come with me. - You know we can't afford for the two of us to go. Wish I could make it better. Sorry about tonight. - It's okay. I was able to change the appointment. We're going next month. - Okay. (slow music) (water running) (moans) (crying) - Mrs. Hobson? - Yeah, I am. It's not every day a spunky-looking young man comes knocking on my door. - I don't feel either, I assure you. - I think you should let me be the judge of that, Mr... - I'm Mitchell Gray, Jacinta's science teacher. - We're getting along so well. What's the little cow done now? - She hasn't done anything. Just wanted to talk to you, if that's alright. - Come in. - I hardly ever talk to her. She comes home straight from school and goes to her room, and so whatever's she's done it's news to me. - Oh no, it's nothing like that. It's just that I'm worried about her. Her schoolwork's gone right down in the last year and she's only just passing. - She's just being a teenager, that's all. It's natural to lose interest in schoolwork at her age. She's probably got hundreds of boyfriends I don't even know about. - No, no, I don't think so. No one at school anyway. Is there someone outside of school that could be influencing her or? - No. No one ever calls. Unless she's managed to smuggle a whole football team in there, I'd say no. Maybe she's fantasizing about her science teacher. She's a weird kid, okay? It's her father's fault. She just runs a mile every time he walks in the room. - So he's not here much then. - Well, he's here but he's not really here, if you know what I mean. - But he lives here, right? - Yeah, he lives here. Doesn't mean he participates. - [Mitchell] So he doesn't talk to her much either? - How would I know? Usually passed out with boredom by 4:30. - Look, I don't mean to interfere, but maybe you should try and talk to her. Because I think she's going through a pretty rough time at the moment or-- - How dare you. How old are you? - Excuse me? - You don't even know what a rough time is, alright? Why don't you stop feeling sorry for yourself that you've lost a good pupil. What about me, huh? She treats me like shit. First I lose my son and now my daughter. So why don't you just get the fuck out of my house? - Look, I didn't mean to-- - Get out. - Hey, hi. - Narelle, how are you? - Good. Just trying to find a table. - Yeah. - You well? - I'm great. No, that's a lie. Work's really busy at the moment, otherwise I'd join you. - Do you come in here all the time? - Pretty much. Yourself? - Yeah. Probably lined up behind you about a hundred times. - I'm sure I would have noticed. - Besides, it's the only place on this side of town. - God, I know. What about afterward, drinks? - [Both] Sea Pub. - Gotta get going. - Sure. - Got a meeting in 10 minutes. - It's great to see you. - Yeah, you too. See ya. - Bye. (elevator music) (rattling) - Actually. (laughs) When are you going to the pub next? - Tomorrow night. - Okay, cool. Well, I might see you then. - Oh, that'd be great! - Great, okay. - See ya. - [Julie] Jacinta, can you come here please? - What do you want? - Is that the way you talk to me? - Good on you. Is that all? - I had a visitor today. - What, the men in white coats finally came, did they? - No. Mitchell Gray. Seems he's worried about your emotional state. Thinks something bad might be going on. What have you been saying? - Nothing. - Well, your favorite teacher's certainly worried. Says you're barely passing and that I should talk to you. Somebody at home must be being a bad influence on you. What do you reckon he means by that? - I didn't say anything. He's making it up. - He's making it up or you're making it up? Is there something you want to talk to me about? - I'm not making anything up. - What's going on? What did you do? - So it's my fault? You wouldn't know anything about my life! - You don't know anything about my life either, girl. You don't know how hard it is to look after you and your dad. - What a joke! Look after us? You can't even look after yourself! What's this and this, huh? I've been looking after me since I was 10! You're nothing but a pathetic drunk! - It's your fault that I'm like this! - Yeah? It's your fault I hate you! I hate you! (cheering) (upbeat music) (kisses) - You look as lost as I feel. (laughs) I take it (mumbles) been at work. - Damn, and here I was thinking I could pass myself off as a game show hostess. - No, I never would have fallen for it. You're in the wrong crowd. - Oh? - All the models are in the line for the toilets, purging the buffet. - (laughs) Charming. - Besides, you're far too natural and beautiful to be on television. - Oh please. - No, it's true. Those women are scary. All they talk about is themselves, their stylists, who they've slept with. You, on the other hand, are intelligent, sophisticated, look like you would never kiss and tell. Far more beautiful than any of these painted dolls. - I'm Vicky, I work as a lawyer for the network. - In house? - No, for Nielson and Bateman. - Ah, big boys. In fact, I saw-- - Vicky. Didn't expect to see you here. - Invitation (mumbles). But if you've got a moment, I've got an update. Sorry... - William. It was a pleasure to meet you. I'll look out for you later by the booth. (laughs) - Shall we? - And so I just told Billy that I didn't ever want to see him again. You know, I think he was genuinely surprised. I think that he thought that I would go for this open relationship thing. - What a wanker. - I know. He thinks he's god's gift. Just because he's good-looking, successful, and can have any woman he wants, doesn't mean he can treat people like that. - Actually, that's probably why he's gotten away with it for so long. - But I just realized that he wasn't who I thought he was. I mean, I didn't fall in love with him, I fell in love with who I thought he was. Which he wasn't. So I guess I can't really be upset about losing someone that wasn't really real. Right? - Right. You definitely deserve someone who shows you who they really are. I mean, I know exactly who Brittney is and what her faults are, and she lets me know exactly what mine are. A lot. - Sounds much better. - No, it's terrible. - Why? - I think the thing she loves about me the most is how much she hates me. I make her really, really unhappy and she lets me know all the time. - Does she make you happy? - To tell you the truth, I can't remember the last time either of us were happy. - So why do you stay together? - We met when I was traveling. She was vibrant and outspoken, the way Americans are, you know. - What, annoying? - No, I liked her. She was exciting, fun, I loved her. And I really wanted to make it work. - Is she as committed to making it work as much as you are? - Yeah, she gave up everything to be with me. She left her family, her friends, her home, and she hates me for it. - Why doesn't she travel? Or go up north and see the country? - Exactly. I've suggested that, offered to pay, but she won't leave the home without me. Thinks I'm trying to get rid of her or something. - I don't know what to say. You're a fantastic guy and I admire that you're hanging in there. I'm sure that if you both want to make it work, you will. - Thank you. - On the other hand, how long can you keep having the same conversation before you realize she's a bit fucked up in the head and nothing's ever going to change? (laughs) - Narelle, you are a breath of fresh air. Most of my friends are far too polite to bring that up. Cheers. Well, I really shouldn't be driving. Want to share a cab? - Yeah. - This calls for a celebratory drink. Do you mind if we go over the details some other time? - No problem. Give the office a call. - Thank you. - He seemed appallingly rude. You and I should stick together. It's us versus them tonight. - He's just a bit prickly. Nothing I can't handle. And my work here is done. - Oh, no, no, you can't leave. I only just found you and besides, you should drink all the free booze first. (glasses clink) (water running) - You haven't returned any of my calls. - Don't know how you got my work number. - I have access to all staff files and you're down as Danny's next of kin. You know, the number you call in case of an emergency. And it was an emergency that I see you. - Tell me, do you often stalk people or am I just special? - (laughs) Special? Haven't I told you that? Is that why you won't see me? Where's Danny? Come home with me tonight. - You see, this is why you're just annoying. You just keep pushing and pushing until you get your own way. - Secret to my success. - Conrad, let me spell it out for you. There is no chance in hell of us ever being together. So why don't you just back off? - Did I imagine us fucking? Oh, I wonder what Danny would say about that. - Danny is my partner. We love each other. We also have an open relationship. The rule is only once, and then we move on. So we don't get attached. To make sure that doesn't happen, I usually sleep with people I don't like. That way it's always just sex. - So if I told Danny you took me like the dirty little bitch you are, he wouldn't bat an eyelid? - What makes you think he doesn't already know? - Oh, he doesn't know. - So what are you gonna tell him? - Has it ever occurred to you what having an open relationship actually means? It means you're not satisfied with the relationship you've got. Oh, look at you. Aren't you pretty when you ain't got nothing to say? (kisses) - Fuck you. - Do you want some money for the-- - God no. I had a really good time. - Yeah, me too. It was great. - It was great just being able to talk. Thank you. You're a really wonderful girl, Narelle. - You're not so bad yourself. Well, suppose I should get home, eh? - Yeah, Brittney will be worried, frantic, suicidal. I wish I didn't have to go. - But you do, right? Well, thank you for the ride home. See ya. - Wait. (laughs) - Thank god, I thought I was gonna suffocate from all the bullshit. - Wow. - Great, isn't it? - You come here often, do you? - Once or twice. They have their parties up here in summer. - The air even seems clearer up here. - Just because it's colder. You smell like banana. - Yeah, it's the shampoo. I had to borrow my daughter's. - So what do you like to do to get away from it all, Vicky? - You mean besides trespassing on rooftops? - Yeah, normally. - What makes you think I need to get away? - Everyone needs to get away sometimes. (kissing) I'm sorry, Vicky. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable. I meant what I said earlier. You really are the most beautiful woman here tonight. Sure is good to have you alone. - William. I'm married. - Not asking for anything from you, Vicky. We're not doing anything wrong. We're just two people sharing a wonderful moment and then we'll go back to our lives, it'll just become a beautiful memory. I don't want to hurt you or disrupt your life. This isn't something bad. This is not an affair. I just met this amazing woman tonight. She's blown me away. And even though I know I can't have her, I just want to share a special moment with her while I can. You are amazing. And sexy as hell. (slow music) - Hi. - Hey. (kisses) What's going on? - I just wanted to welcome you home. Look, I've got something to say so please don't say anything. I know that I have been a real bitch lately and I'm sorry. But it's just that I'm so afraid of losing you. So I decided tonight that I wasn't going to ask you where you'd been or why you didn't call or anything. Just want you to know that I love you. (kisses) Good night, darling. - Hey. Good night? - Yeah. Go to sleep. (water running) - [Shane] Jacinta. Jas! (breathing heavily) - Oh, a knight in shining armor, are you? I knew you'd come. - What are you up to, old girl? Taking a little nap, are you? - Jacinta! (mumbles) Yeah. Yeah, she's spying, she's spying. She's spying, collecting information. She's gonna write it all down and she's gonna tell the world what a bad mother I am. - No, come on, come on. - I'm a terrible mother. - Come on. - She even told that teacher what a bad mother I am. - What are you talking about? - He came to spy. - What teacher? What are you talking about? - He said something bad is going on, said that I should talk to her. - What'd you say? - Nothing. He said everything's my fault. And it is, it's all my fault. - No, it's not. You did everything for her when she was little. Come on. - No. - Come on. - After David died... - Come on, let's get you to bed. Come on. - (crying) It's my fault that David died. He was asking and asking... I yelled at him "Get your own bloody dinner!" I didn't see him, and he went in the kitchen and pulled a pot, the pot with the boiling water. It poured all over him. It went all over him. It went all on his face and hands and then he breathed it in and it went inside of him. (crying) He wasn't my boy, he looked horrible. I didn't ring the ambulance for 10 minutes. And he died. It was fault that he died. I'm sorry. Please don't blame me. - My god, you're out of the office. - Yes, I'm developing defamation-itis. - Vicky. How is Hayden doing? - Hayden? I don't know really. I haven't seen him since the dinner. But that's not unusual. We only get to catch up every six months or so these days. - But you all used to be best friends. - Sure, but having children can have a huge effect on your social life. I don't remember the last time I went out and met new people. - I don't think he's that happy. And I don't think their relationship has much longer to live either. - Excuse me? - Yeah, I ran into him a couple of times. - Really? Where? - Oh, just in the city. You know, getting lunch and that. And we had a drink at the pub last week. Had a chat. About Brittney. - Hayden was talking to you about Brittney. - Yeah! I mean, I was telling him about my problems with Billy and how I'm over him, and he was telling me about his problems with Brittney. - And you went out together? To the pub? - I wouldn't say together. We happened to be at the pub at the same time. You know how it is, always running into the same people. Fucking great. - What's wrong with you? - That guy? - He's just someone I met at a work function last week, William someone. - Vicky, that's Billy. - Billy. Billy? Not your Billy? - Vicky, nice to see you again. Narelle, I have to-- - Go away, Billy, I don't want to talk to you. - Bit awkward. Well, I should get back to work. Bye. Vicky, I know I shouldn't ask this given the situation, but would you please ask Narelle to give me a call? I really miss her. (door closing) - Hey, you're home. Not shooting today? - No. - Huh? - No, and I'm not shooting tomorrow either. - Is everything alright? - What do you mean, Mitchell? Why wouldn't everything be alright? - I don't know. - You don't know. I think you do. - No, I don't, Danny. What's going on? - What, you think I wouldn't find out? Oh, come on. You can tell the truth now. Conrad. - Look, I was off my head, okay? He was just there and-- - [Danny] And you fucked him! - And I, yes. - How could you? - Danny, it was just a once-off, okay? - No, no, no, don't touch me. It wasn't just a one-off. You lied to me. He phoned here! In our house, you lied. - I didn't mean to, okay? He was just on the phone, I didn't know what to say. - How could you do this to us? - Now, Danny, hang on. We agreed on this, okay? - No, no, no, no, we didn't. - We did too! - No, this is different. This is with someone that you know I hate. Don't you know how this affects our lives? - Yeah, I know, I know. - You know? - Look, Danny, I'm sorry, okay? - Why did you do it? Did you do this to piss me off? - No, I didn't just do this to fucking piss you off! I don't know, it just fucking happened, okay? - It just fucking happened, did it? Well, then you can just go and fuck whoever you want then, okay? Because really, I don't care. - Danny, Danny! - Hey. How are you? - Fine. How was your day? - Okay. What's wrong? - Where have you been? - What do you mean, work? - Well, I just cooked your dinner. I'm not doing it anymore. - Fine. - What? - Fine, you don't have to cook me dinner anymore. - Oh, come on! Hayden, I cook for you because I want to! You don't even thank me. You don't even appreciate it. God, and I am so fucking sick of it! - Oh, you're sick of it? You want to know what I'm sick of, Brittney? I'm sick of walking in night after night, not knowing what mood you're going to be in. I can't make you happy-- - I don't know what I want! - No, you don't know what you want. You know what you want, Brittney? You want to be the victim. That's what you want. - I do not want to be the victim! - [Hayden] Yes, you do, you set yourself up for it morning after morning, night after night. - Don't call me that, I'm not that person! - [Hayden] Don't walk away. You are! - Excuse me? All I've ever wanted from you was for you to make me feel good. - Jesus, I try, Brittney. I don't know what to give you anymore! I can't give you enough and I don't know what you want. - I just want to make you happy, Hayden! I used to make you happy. Now when I do stuff for you, all you do is complain about how it pisses you off. - I don't! I don't know how to make you happy, Brittney! I don't. - Hayden. Hayden, do you love me? What? - I don't love you anymore. (crying) - Don't. So I guess I'm going home? ♫ Take this moment ♫ Make it an only ♫ So happy is my thought ♫ That I can't hardly stand ♫ But I don't have the answer that I planned ♫ I know I got some baggage ♫ But I lost the tags ♫ So I don't know the content of these bags ♫ I got to take this moment (moaning) - I love you. Did you hear me? Well? - Well what? - Do you love me? - Yeah. Shane? - Yeah? - When can we go away? - Soon. I just have to organize a few more things at work and then we can go wherever you like. - I want to go to Africa. - Africa? What do you want to go there for? - I don't know. Somewhere different. Where no one I know is ever likely to go. - Yeah, sure. - Have you got enough money? - Don't you worry about that. Everything will be fine, just no more talking to teachers, otherwise we won't be able to go anywhere. - I didn't say anything. He's just nice, that's all. - Nice, is he? You haven't got a crush on him, have you? - No. - No, really? What about the other boys at school? - Stop it. - You got a boyfriend? Have you? - Yes. You. (kisses) - Fuck. (knocking) - Vicky? Vicky, are you in here? - Yeah, just a sec. (toilet flushing) Sorry, I'm not feeling well. I'm sorry I disappeared from the office. You must be upset about Billy. I had no idea that was Billy. - No, Vicky, believe me, I'm over him. It's done. - Sorry, I'm just not myself. Don't normally behave like this. - Vicky, Claire's school just called. She's okay, but she's had an accident and she's broken her arm. - Where is she? - She's on her way to the hospital. - Which one? - The Melbourne Hospital. I've cleared your schedule for the day! - Hey. - Hey. - What's wrong? - Claire's had an accident at school, I have to go. - Oh, is she alright? - I don't know, she'll want me. Can you get Narelle to call ahead? - Sure, sure, I'll call you. Good luck, bye. - [Narelle] Hi. - Hi. - You've just missed Vicky. - Yeah, I saw her. Poor Claire. She asked if you could call ahead. - Yeah, I've left a message. I've rung the school and she's gonna be fine. - Good. Actually it's you I came to see. - Oh? - Narelle, would you like to go out with me? - And your girlfriend would think what, exactly, about this? - Not girlfriend anymore. We broke up. She's packed her clothes, bit of my clothes, borrowed my money. (laughs) She's going back to America. - Call yourself a fast mover then? - No. I just feel like I've wasted enough time already and if you feel like you're up to it, I'd love to take you out to dinner. Or to Europe, whichever you prefer. - Are you sure about this? It's not some rebound thing? - I have never been so sure of anything in my life. Say yes. Say yes. - Yes. - Very happy. - I'm a little excited myself. Better go now. People are staring. - Oh. Well, I gotta go back to work. Back to my job, not that I think I have one because I just walked out on my boss. (kissing) ♫ Darling, I want to see you now - I'll pick you up at seven. ♫ Darling ♫ I missed you ♫ Do you keep a secret smile, a secret smile for me? - You're the only one I can talk to, Shane. Just wish Dad would listen and then everything-- - Hey. Thing you gotta realize about your father is that he doesn't give a fuck about anyone else. Took him 10 years to make me a partner and it was like getting blood out of a stone. Don't you worry about it. I'll look after you now. (kisses) No more talking about your father.

I can help you with this, alright? But you've got to promise me, not a word until I get there. Mr. Gray? Hi, I'm Anthony Connor, family's lawyer. Listen, it's a bit of a hard situation, I'm afraid. Jacinta won't talk to the police. She asked to see you. I thought maybe you could talk to her. - My god, what's happened? - Well, we're gonna need a doctor to examine her if she's willing. - Julie. Julie. - [Jacinta] Mum? Mum? - Hey. What are you doing here? - You asked me to come and pick her up. - What are you talking about? - I left you messages. - [Claire] Daddy! - Oh my god, what happened? - I fell off the monkey bars at school. - And you broke your arm? Tell me exactly what happened. - I was hanging upside down and then I slipped. And then they went to go get a teacher and they took me inside and called Mum. - [Anthony] I'm so sorry, my darling. You're more important to Mummy and Daddy than anything else in the world. You know that, don't you? We're family and we'll always be there and I promise this will never happen again. ♫ Is there sanctuary in you? - Are you on the flight to Sydney? - None of your business. - American? An international flight, perhaps? By the way, you're far too beautiful to-- - Excuse me! Why don't you just fuck off? As if I would ever have anything to do with you. If there's one thing I've learned from being here, it's that Australian men think about nothing but themselves. You're probably only talking to me because I have breasts! Hey. Don't you walk away from me while I'm talking to you! Hey, asshole! I'm not finished! Oh, okay. You can just keep on walking, mister. Keep on walking, because I am a strong American woman and nobody gets away from me because I've been burned before! Hey! Shit. Okay, no, I'm fine. Nobody help me. I'm okay! Assholes! Hey, you.
