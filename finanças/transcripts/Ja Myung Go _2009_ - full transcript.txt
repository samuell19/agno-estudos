Two daughters born of Choi Li will bring about the collapse of Naknang? Have him kill his own daughters! You must have a son My Lady. It has to be a son, or the baby will die! Is it a boy or a girl? Tell him it's a boy. But they'll soon find out it's a lie. Please save my life. Please let me go, I can't breathe. Now tell me how I can save my daughter. Do you have a military kite? What does that mean? Did I have a son or a daughter? Ma Haso. I have sinned against you. Captain Choi, carry out the royal command. Wait. Prime Minister, you have to go to His Majesty. Spare Wang's baby and kill Mo's baby? Yes, he said that's the will of the heavens. Give me that baby. I have carried her within me for nine months. I'll send her away with my own hands. She's breathing. Sister! I killed her once already. I can't do it twice. Are you trying to kill the whole family? I cannot believe you. Did you not set the whole thing up? How dare you try to frame me with that lowly mouth! Jasil, have you lost your mind? What's going on? Our baby came back to life. Please save her life. Save my daughter. Save your daughter. What are you doing? If I hadn't done it, you would have had to. I promised her I'd save the child's life. Il Poom, you go with her in my place and take care of her. Mom. Part 4 - My Lady. - My Lady. - Poor baby. Oh baby! - Baby. My Lady. Mom... Mom... Mom. My baby! Cry. Cry and save your life. Jamyung... Yes l'll call you Jamyung from now. Since l can't save you... You must cry and save yourself true to the meaning of your name... l feel it in my heart... Jamyung! Jamyung! Jamyung? WANG JA-SlL Choi Li's Second Wife WANG JA-SlL Choi Li's Second Wife lf she could save her life by crying she wouldn't have been stabbed by me But if she's lucky she could be rescued by fishermen. That's possible. l hope she cries until someone finds her. Follow the river to Jeungsan Harbor. Jeungsanpo / Mouth of Daedong River in today's southern Pyeongyang There's a village of fishermen. Jeungsanpo / Mouth of Daedong River in today's southern Pyeongyang Find the town chief when you arrive. Great idea. Don't you want to save Baby Jamyung? We can bring her back someday as long as she's alive. Tell him to overturn the boat whenever he sees it. My Lady. That's not enough. Tell him to make sure the two children die. Tell him to throw them in the water. Mo Haso will try to save her daughter. You have to get there first. l don't want to do it. You're scaring me. What? We had no choice when one of the babies had to die but do you have to go so far? You want to die in my hands like Dalgaebi? l can't let you live when you know of my plans. My Lady... These lowly servants just don't understand. This is why they should be governed with a whip not kindness. The only words you need to say are ''yes'' and ''l understand. '' Who gave you the permission to think? All you have to do is move your hands and feet. Do you want to die right here? Please spare me. l won't tolerate your impertinence again. ljust can't stand the sound of your baby's crying. lt just doesn't feel right. CHOl Ll / Joseon Origin Commander of Nakrang Army HOGOK Senior Officer of Nakrang Army l thought she was dead but she's not... How can that be? Time will take care of it. How will she survive this cold winter river? Right... l'll trust you. - Let's go. - Yes sir! Why are you here? lf she's your daughter she's also my daughter. l came to say farewell to Jamyung and to console Mo Haso. So you came all the way here. You wouldn't have brought me. Let's go home. l want to help the Lady. She doesn't need your support. Do you know what it is like to give birth? lt feels as if every bone in your body crushes away and every drop of your blood leaves your body. Yet l came all this way on horseback only a day after giving birth... l don't believe you're a compassionate person. Then why do you think l came here? There are ice blocks as solid as a boulders. They wouldn't break even if you hit them with a rock. But poke a needle at the center and it'll shatter into pieces. Did we shatter into pieces? At the least you can say you've poked a needle at the center of my heart. Dear. Since you came here alone on horseback you should be able to return the same way. l don't want to put you in the same carriage with Mo Haso. lLPUM / Dalgaebi's son Don't cry. Don't cry. JAMYUNG Choi Li & Mo Haso's daughter Don't cry. Don't cry. MO HASO / Choi Li's First Wife Cry out loudly. MO HASO / Choi Li's First Wife lt's okay. DONGOBl / llpum's Aunt Dalgaebi's sister DONGOBl / llpum's Aunt Dalgaebi's sister My pain is nothing compared to yours. We can't do anything about our different status but ourfeelings are another story. You and l share the same pain... Stay. You gave your life as well as your son's for my daughter. l don't know how l'll everthank you. Master... Thank you Master. Sister... Sister. The wind is cold. lt can't be colder than the river. You just gave birth. Then l should have a baby. l should be holding her in my bosom. Where is Jamyung now? Mo Haso. Don't touch me. l want to die. l can't leave my daughter alone in that freezing cold river. You can hate me after we return home. My Lady. So you did have a bit of a temper. You promised me you'd save Jamyung. You promised me you'd leave this cruel land with Jamyung. l probably couldn't have kept that promise even if not forJasil. Was that the kind of man you are? A man who can't keep his word? l hesitated because of you but in the end... l would have killed Jamyung with my own hands. Are you that afraid of Liu Xian? lt's because of my ambition to become a great man. l don't think l can... l don't think l can everfall asleep in your arms again... How can l live as your wife when Jamyung's cries are in my ears? Please let me leave. Mo Haso. l won't kill myself because l believe that Jamyung will survive. Just let me leave you. Mo Haso. l couldn't let you live as Jamyung's mother but l'll make you the mother of Nakrang. What does that... Weren't you and my brother going to bring Liu Xian down? l'll kill Liu Xian and make you the mother of the people of Joseon. Take care of them as you would Jamyung and let them comfort you in return. Honey. You've gained too much for throwing a newborn into the river. Since you came here alone on horseback you should be able to return the same way. l don't want to put you in the same carriage with Mo Haso. Love doesn't last forever. lt will change with time... Mo Haso you can have Choi Li's heart. l'll have his power. GUKNAE PALACE GOGURYEO - The King is returning! - Hooray for the king. GUKNAE PALACE GOGURYEO - The King is returning! - Hooray for the king. Hooray for the Prince. Hooray! HODONG Hooray for the king. KlNG DAEMUSHlN Third King of Goguryeo Hooray for the Prince. Hooray! Good work. lt's okay. Get back on the horse and step down on the men. But l can do it alone. l know that. Adeok help Hodong down. lt's an honor Your Majesty. Get back on the horse. But he's an old man. Don't make me repeat myself. What is a king? He's a father who governs his people with kindness. And his people? They're the source of the king's power on which he can lean. ls this your idea or Eul Duji's? l learned from him and l agree... l'm right aren't l? A king is someone who feeds his subjects and his subjects are people who keep asking for more food. More food more food more food! They demand incessantly. And when a king can't satisfy their hunger they'll turn against their king and kill him and then find themselves a new king. l'm scared. l know. You can't trust your subjects. Father. A kingdom's power comes from food and the power of a king comes from a sword. Father. A king's sword is used to slay his enemies but sometimes you have to slay your own people. Rememberthat. l don't understand. What can't you understand? Why can't l govern our people with kindness? Do you want to be a good man? Yes. Then you can't be a king. l want to be a good king. There's no such thing as a good or bad king. Why not? lt's your choices not your character that make you either a good or a bad king. You chose the sword but l'll choose kindness. Neitheryou nor l can make that decision. Who makes that decision if a king can't? Only the time you live in will decide that. Hodong can't become a king? Maegu heard it with her own ears. SONG MAESEOLSU Goguryeo's Queen He's always been a softie SONG MAESEOLSU Goguryeo's Queen nothing like His Majesty. lt's too early to rejoice. As the saying goes there's a thin line between good and evil. YANGDEOK Song Maeseolsu's head maid l'm too ignorant to understand what you mean. My queen that must've hurt. Why would you pull out yourfine hair? Every strand of hair is precious as you age... A gap this narrow can split heaven and earth. Between two people it could be worse. But His Majesty adores the prince. l'll put my hope on this tiny gap and bring myself closerto the king with everything l've got. l have to go greet His Majesty. l Eul Duji am now departing for Nakrang as your envoy to celebrate Liu Xian's 30th anniversary on the throne. l Chu Balso leave with him. Make sure to bring back all that's due from Liu Xian. l'll bring back food to last us through the winter. He'd be a thief if he doesn't give us anything. We're giving him tiger skins bearskins pigskins topaz amethyst and a ruby this size for his crown... RUBY That will put some weight on Liu Xian's head. EUL DUJl / Senior Head Officer of National Administration General Wu Naru... WU NARU / Hodong's Uncle Head of National Administration Eul Duji you must keep your ears open. l find it hard to communicate with scholarly types. l'll say that again. That will put some weight on Liu Xian's head. . He should give as much as he gets. And if he doesn't we'll take it from him. That's the attitude. CHU BALSO / Executive Officer of Goguryeo's southern district The ruby is the size of a chestnut not a fist. Fine whatever. And while you're there stuff his subordinates' pockets with some gold. And get some information on the rebel's movements. Wu Naru is right. Your Majesty. Wang Goeng took an army of 1500 to Madeung Mountain. SPY According to our spy Wang's men are all Hans and Choi Li's troops are all men of Joseon. Something is going on. Look out for Choi Li's and Wang Goeng's every move. As you command. lf it looks like Liu Xian is about to lose his head in an uprising make sure to bring back all the rice and salt you can get your hands on as well as the animal skins and jewels you're taking. Master l wish you a safe trip. Keep up your studies. PRlNCE'S TEACHER / Responsible of the prince's education You're relieved of your duties as the prince's teacher. PRlNCE'S TEACHER / Responsible of the prince's education Father! Prince Hodong. Please tell me what l've done wrong. You have made Hodong into a weakling. You taught him this nonsense about governing his people with kindness. A good king stuffs food down his people's throats and he needs power in orderto do that. A sovereign's power does not reside only in his sword. Atrue king should have the following four qualities: benevolence righteousness courtesy and wisdom. A load of crap! lt's just gibberish spoken by dreamers like Confucius and Mencius. What Goguryeo desperately needs right now is oceans rivers fertile lands and rice! A king without morals will only bring bloodshed. l don't think so. A king exists beyond morals. And Hodong has to be a strong king. He has to attack Buyeo attack Nakrang and attack Liadong! That is what Hodong Goguryeo's next king must do. That is why Hodong needs a teacher who'll teach him the cold reality of current politics. General Wu Naru. Yes Your Majesty. You will teach Hodong the the value of war. As you wish Your Majesty. Chu Balso. Yes Your Majesty. You'll teach Hodong how cold politics is and how pathetic a weak sovereign is as soon as you return from Nakrang. As you wish Your Majesty. l don't want Hodong to become a big fish in a little pond a summer bug that knows nothing of winter or a boring scholar who only cares about morals. l want Hodong to become a strong sovereign a strong conqueror who'll succeed me! Don't be too disappointed. You can become Hodong's teacher again after he becomes a strong king. This powerthing can get to your head when you have it fortoo long. l cannot say His Majesty is entirely wrong but he's not entirely right. You should be more flexible. Being too straight can hurt you sometimes. Be more flexible from time to time. My only concern is... ... the queen... Spit it out. Don't hide around the bush and lose me. Prince Hodong is lonely. Since his mother was from Buyeo our enemy state he has no maternal relatives to depend on. And he has no siblings to protect him. And he's too young to manage his way in vicious and bloody politics. But he has his father. His Majesty is a cold-hearted man. General Wu Naru you must protect Prince Hodong. Eul Duji there's one thing that's fair in this world. Let me hear it. Whetheryou or me His Majesty or Prince Hodong even a mere foot soldier or a slave all lives are exposed to some danger every second of the day. And if he doesn't have the guts to face danger he shouldn't be Goguryeo's king. Did you have fun with Hodong on your camping trip? You came here to ask me that? l am a queen and l can go anywhere l wish. Goguryeo women... Hodong you're very lucky to have great teachers such as Eul Duji General Wu Naru and Chu Balso. Yes Mother. l still haven't mastered flexibility yet. l want to continue to learn sword fighting from Aunt. lf you must learn a feminine style of sword fighting you can learn from your mother. From Mother? Yeorang's techniques are flashy and flexible but she can't beat your mother. That's not true. Her sword has intention to kill so if you can beat her you'll be able to kill your own family. You're exaggerating Your Majesty. You must be tired. Have some warm milk and get some rest. Yes Mother. Now that you've sent Hodong away tell me what's on your mind. The night you went on the camping trip was the night you were supposed to visit my chamber. So you want me to stop by tonight? Please consider it my longing foryou. Fine. l will make it up to you. l look forward to how you'll please me. l'll do my best. Your Majesty. Your Majesty. What's the fuss about? The chief is here. My father? You're the king's father-in-law. Why did you come unannounced... BlRYUNA TRlBE / One of the five major tribes of Goguryeo Why didn't the Biryuna tribe notify Goguryeo of your visit? SONG OKGU Chief of Biryuna tribe Since the queen has no power SONG OKGU Chief of Biryuna tribe herfather will only be a laughing stock SONG OKGU Chief of Biryuna tribe if he makes a grand entrance. l'll inform His Majesty of your arrival. lt's all right. Muhyul and l are not too fond of each other. Hodong could be made crown prince soon. lmpossbile! Muhyul has secretly begun contacting the otherfourtribes excluding us. He's asking fortheir support in making Hodong the crown prince. You must stop him. Who dares become crown prince when l haven't produced a prince yet? lmpossible! The Yeona, Gwana, Hwana tribes have already agreed to it. No! There are even some people in the Biryuna tribe who doubts you. Father! How could we trust the future of the Biryuna tribe with the queen who has no son? We'd rather guarantee our survival by staying on Hodong's good side. Maeseolsu don't forget. Time waits for no one and people run out of patience. And l can only stick up foryou for so long. Are you dead? That must hurt. Did you die because it hurts? You're alive. l'll help you. Be quiet. Don't cry. l won't touch it if you don't want me to. You're hungry aren't you? You need milk since you're a baby. l need Mom. Mom... Mom... You can't screw this up. What screw up? ljust have to overturn the boat and drown two kids right? lt's easierthan eating a piece of cake. l'm just afraid you'll drop the plate. Don't you worry. This is my territory. No one would dare to drown in this river without my permission. lf the boat left at five they should be here soon if they fish didn't eat them. Make sure they're dead. But what kind of man can be so cruel? Many people have lost their lives wondering about that. Just tell yourself you're sending the souls where they belong. Brother let's go. Okay! lt's salty. l'm sorry. l'm not a mom. This is hard for me too. l'm so scare. ls it good? That tickles. Don't do that. lsn't that the boat? Yes l knew it was about time. lt's amazing how they made it this far. - Let's go. - Okay. What's going on? Maybe l'll get struck by lightning trying to kill Baby Jamyung. l'm only doing what Lady Wang ordered me to do. Please help me? What's going on here? Just get the boat close to them! You do it if you can. What's that? Start rowing. You too! l lost my oar. lt's trying to swallow our boat. Row! Dear Heaven! l'm sorry. Lahee. What's wrong with Lahee? Something's wrong with her. She has no fever and she had a good bowel movement too. You try. She wouldn't suckle my breast either. What's wrong with her? Don't open the door. You are letting the wind in. Master is getting ready to leave. He is? General Wang has sent word that he'll be arriving exactly at five o'clock. Ourtroops are already assembled at the Dangun Shrine. - Lady Wang. - Lady Wang. And Baby Lahee. Please leave us. l'll help him get ready. l am Wang Jasil. l'm the sister of Wang Goeng who pledged to help you bring down Liu Xian. We may be half-siblings but my brother adores me. Are you threatening me? lt was your choice to kill Jamyung. Hate yourself. Don't hate me. l hate myself more than enough. But l can't forgive you either. Lahee is your daughter. She refuse to be fed. She can survive for a few days but she can't survive if she doesn't drink. Drink well. lt's enough that l lost Jamyung. Do not make yourfather sad. Get a new nanny. Find as many as you need. Yes. Please return safely. You must win this battle for Lahee's sake. You must be a healthy baby when l return. She woke up briefly but fell back asleep aftertaking her medicine. Gee bee tang/Medicine for mental stability but fell back asleep aftertaking her medicine. l told myself l am childless the day l abandoned Jamyung... And although l knew it would hurt you even more l couldn't turn my back on Lahee. Lahee is also my daughter. WANG GOENG / Joseon Origin Commander of Nakrang Army Begin. We will begin. That's not necessary. Just do it. Yes sir. l'm sick of snow... lt never stops. Please hurry. The queen is waiting foryou. l'm sick of that too. lt's sweet Osmanthus perfume His Majesty's favorite. lt's dried jasmine. YEONGCHUNWHA / One of jasmine flowers has seductive effect. YEONGCHUNWHA / One of jasmine flowers has seductive effect. lt's supposed to stimulate man's passion. His Majesty the King. You've come. l had no choice. You told me to come. l'll do it. Yes Your Majesty. Please have a restful night. Let's get to bed. Just a moment. lt's raspberry wine. lt's sweet and fragrant. lt'll help you sleep... lt's all the same everywhere. Concubines and the queen... They all offer me raspberry wine and dried jasmine. And the smell of sweet Osmanthus on you... l'm sick of it. l can't even breathe in this room. Your Majesty. Here l drank it. Let's go to sleep now. WU NARU / Hodong's Uncle Head of National Administration What's the matter with you Princess? YEORANG / Hodong's Aunt Wu Naru's wife l can't admit that you're betterthan me. YEORANG / Hodong's Aunt Wu Naru's wife l taught Hodong. Why does he say your brute strength is betterthan my skill? A sword is still a sword no matter what and it's for cutting off heads. Pick up your sword. No. Then l'll make you. Once was a game but l won't stop until l see blood. Fine don't stop until you see blood. Let's find out who's better. You've never bested me until now. How can l beat you Princess? l can beat everyone else but you. Pick up your sword. Let's just say l lost. l lost. We're supposed to get togethertonight. Let's not waste ourtime on this. Help me. The princess is trying to kill me! Stop right there! Princess what will you gain from becoming a widow? Do you have a new man in your life? What did you say? You dare mock to me? l'll kill you. Please take pity on me and spare my life. l said l'm sick of it all. Your Majesty. You want this old body? Yes l do. What a pity. l'm not interested in you. The palace is full of women younger and prettier than you and l have no desire to hold you. l was raised as a queen from the moment l was born to the chief of the Biryuna tribe. l lived my entire life foryou. Continue. Do you intend to let me die a virgin? l beg and beg you... But you come to this room only twice a month only to leave at the crack of dawn without touching a strand of my hair. ls this the life of a queen? Why are you so greedy? You have the greatest power any woman can have. You should be satisfied with that. l'd rather give up being a queen if this insult is the price l have to pay. You were once young and beautiful. lt was painful for me to come to your room because it was hard for me to control my lust. lf you want to live as my woman ratherthan as a queen you should discard your greed. So my desire to be a woman is a greed? lf you put it that way l feel sorry foryou. Queen... Let me ask you something. What is it? Do you have to produce a son and... ... kill Hodong? Would sons who share my blood have to fight and kill each other? Must brothers bring bloodshed on themselves? How can you say something so atrocious... Your Majesty. Raise your head and answer me truthfully. l will. Did you try to kill Hodong that day in the garden? Song Maeseolsu answer me. Did you try to kill Hodong my one and only son?
