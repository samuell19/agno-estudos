(laughs) * Happy birthday to you * Happy birthday to you - [Lara] Your singing makes me want to cut off my ears and feed them to that ugly dog our neighbors just bought. - Come on, their puppy's cute and I wouldn't vouch for your voice either. - [Lara] Well, we'll let the Grammy's decide that. Okay, baby cakes? - Okay, deal. Anyway, I'm on the Omolara, and I'll send Charles with a boat to come and get you, yep? - [Lara] Have them prepare the strongest drink possible before I get there, Abeg. - Okay, love you too. * If you wanna have fun get your hustle right, do it * * Shout out to the gidi life * If you wanna get it, girls, get the money right do it * * Welcome to the city * I don't mean the Instagram * Baby baby baby, oh my baby * pay me what you owe - Oh my God! * Baby baby baby, baby baby baby, pay me what you owe * - I can see it now, Lara Giwa featuring Drake. * Pay me what you owe It makes sense. * Pay me what you owe, pay me, pay me what you owe * * Gimme my dough, gimme my dough, pay me * * Pay me what you owe * Do I look like Rhianna, nada * Do I look like Beyonce, hey * Do I look like your mama, nada * - [Trish] Wait, that was it? - Yeah. - That's like the final version? - Yes, Trish. Forget you, what do you guys think? Do you like it? - So, (laughs) so. What'd you think? - So I think that your vocal dexterity is improving, but the thing is-- - Get out! - See what I mean? (traffic honking) - Okay, I hope all my money's there. - Yes, it is. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - See you next time. - All right, cheers. - And you actually have some birthday gifts with me. I have them in the car. Do you want me to bring them? - Birthday gifts? Oh, you know what? Just take everything that looks shiny and expensive and foreign, put it to one side, and then throw everything else away or give it to Trish. (laughing) * If you wanna get it, girls, get your money right do it * * To ba lowo, better slide to the side * * Slide, slide to the side * No, I ain't got time - Welcome to our boat. Come on, come on, come on. Hey, baby sis, mwah, mwah. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Everyone say hi to my baby sister, Dara. - Hi! - Hi. - Girls, can you go on the deck please? 'Cause I wanna have a chat with my baby sister. Chop chop, Ngozi, stop staring at me. Jeez, what's happening for my birthday? - Well-- - Why isn't Tina handling it? - Because she's still traumatized from doing it last year so I decided to help her this year. You were too harsh on her. - Harsh? - Yes. - I wasn't harsh enough. Anyway, whatever. She's a bloody servant. - No, she's your personal assistant. - Same thing. - No. - Whatever. Oh, look at my Instagram. Let's make a video. - Can we not share this moment with-- - Hello, everybody. My name is Oprah. This is my sister and she doesn't believe in happiness, music, life, nothing. - That is not funny. - But it's true. - No it's not. - Tell that to my 3 million Instagram followers. - Great. - I'm sorry they gone. - So about Jide? - Yes. I think he's gonna propose this weekend on my birthday. Yeah, yeah, I really think so. - Why? - He took me to the jewelers the other day and he was like, "Anything you like? "Anything you see that you like?" And I was like, "Yeah." - Are you serious? - Yes! - I'm so excited! Maybe he'll do it at the party. - That's the idea. That's what I think too, so it's gonna be amazing. - Anyway, about our company. I just thought that we should take a more active role, because I've been attending our board meetings and I just wanna get involved, you know, more involved before I go for my master's in the fall, you know, like just oversee what Uncle Tunde's doing. - Why don't you just let Uncle Tunde handle it? By the way, that man hasn't even called to wish me a happy birthday. What could be more important than wishing your niece a happy birthday? - No, but think about it. To be honest, I feel like we're falling behind digitally with digital content in the company. I really feel like that's the next angle, we should take it. There's a movie I'm doing and this time around I'm gonna make it about mom and dad. - Why don't you just leave them out of this? Those are your dark, no sound, no color, no anything movies. They just scare the living daylights out of me. Like horror films or something. - They are not all like that, come on. - Jeez, yes they are. - Okay, fine. I'm sorry. It's your birthday, I shouldn't talk about this. - Exactly. Let's talk about me and my birthday. How about that? (mellow music) - Sal, what are you doing? - Guy. I'm trying to cook something. - You are not serious. Which beat is this one again? - You know, it's for the grown and sexy, we don't play. - I pity you, I pity you. If Big Chi catches you. - Where's he? - Ah, he will soon be here. - Oh man. - Good day sir, good day sir. - Mr. Man. - Yes sir. - What's with all this? You haven't finished with the cleaning. - Go ahead. - Oh yeah, I was just... - This boy. - Checking some-- - This boy. - There's something here. - I am just tired. Tired of you. (whistling) (Pidgin) Please Please Run to Kilimanjaro and buy me a bucket of chicken with french fries. Add small Jollof rice. Quick, go go, go. Lest I forget, please buy me rice and beans. What did I say? - Rice and beans. - Again. - Rice and beans. - And add one more bucket of fried chicken. You know I like my chicken? - Cripsy fried. - That's whats up, baddest boy. - Yes sir. Be going, be going. - Yay. Let me check my. (lively music) (mellow music) (engines roaring) * Nanananana, ooh (singing in foreign language) * It's been a long time, long time * * It's been a long, long time * She wanna come around, come around now * * Said she wanna comearound - I got you your favorite. - Yes. - One more. I got this for you Dara, enjoy. - Thank you. - Thank you. * It's been a long, long time * But she wanna come around now * * Come around, come around * Said she wanna come around now * * It's been a long long time * But she wanna come around now * * Come around, come around, say she wanna come around * (women whooping) (Angélique Kidjo "Wombo Lombo" on radio) (singing angélique kidjo wombo lombo) * Ilé onindjo wa lègb odo * * Inou gbèrko oman tou oko akpèdja * * Have you ever seen, this man moving * * Do you think anyone else can do it * * Really this dance has got something * * Something, no way you can't beat it * - One, two, three! Hey, hey, hey, hey! * Wombo lombo * Wombo lombo * Wombo lombo - Oh my god! (singing in foreign language) - Oh, hey Patience. - Hi Patience. - Happy birthday Ms. Lara. I made you this. - Cake, woo! Put it on the side, cut a big fat chunky cake. - Sure. - You know. - I will. - Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy. Ooh, is that for me? - Yes. - Give it here. - It's so beautiful. Thank you Patience. - You're welcome. - Photo album, please. - There you go. Well, I figured because it's just been five years and I'll just make a photo album of your mom and give it to you as a way of appreciation. - What did you put inside this cake? What are we, in like 2008? That sounds like freaking down, dirty Tamar Braxton from like Bend Down Select. - It's an old recipe from my aunt. - Patience. I told you, I've started my vegan diet, I can't be eating eggs, eugh! - Oh, well, I'm so sorry. I thought it was your usual cheat day. So don't worry. I'll make you another one, a vegan one. Okay? - Better. - Lara. - What? I mean look, I have to be in good shape for Jide's big announcement and I can't be having no lung cancer. Do you get me? - You just had fish and it's not even plant based. Thank you, Patience. - It's all right. - Sorry. - Look, RIP to your auntie and everything. Don't take any offense to it. It's just, can't eat it. - It's nothing, okay. I can make another one. All right? - All right now. - It's a birthday cake and she should enjoy her birthday cake on her birthday. - See, she understands. So chill. - Excuse me ladies. - You're just too much. - You don't even like cake. (mellow music) - Patience. Gosh, you know every last Thursday of the month I'm supposed to be dressed in Indian attire. This komono is not gonna work. It is not gonna work. It looks ridiculous. I look ridiculous. - I'm sorry Ms. Lara. John at the laundry burnt your sari and there was not enough time to order another one. - I don't care. Do I look like I care? Of course not. Are my friends here? - Yes, at the pool. - Come on then. (people chattering) - So yeah, I'm supposed to pay my fees within the week, but I'm really excited about the masters program. - Oh Dara. - The princess finally awakes. - Trish, why don't you ask the beautician to give you something for all of that envy that you have all over your face. It's starting to spread. (girls laughing) Hey girls. - Hello Lara. Tell them about Jide. - Oh yes. Jide, ladies, today is the day. Jide's gonna propose. - You know how all these Yoruba Demons are? There are levels to their commitment, so I suggest that you wait and see what level he's on, before you decide to say I do. - With all of that optimism, it's shocking that you're still single. - Anyway, as I was saying, Jide's mother called to wish me a happy birthday and guess how she addressed me? - How? (Yoruba language) Good Morning our Wife (all laughing) - It's definitely happening. * I been fall for dis fine boy * E tell sey e go marry me, fine face but him pocket ugly * - Ok ladies. I've got to go for a board meeting, so I will be seeing you much later at the party. Love you. * Brake dey fail no control * Shebi you see mumu today * Baby na me and you today - Good morning Sal. - Good morning. * I no be mumu, no be mumu * Ma shemileshe * Ma shemileshe * I no be mumu, mumu * Abeg somebody rescue me * This boy go killi me, 911 I need a rescue * * Daybreak you run away, night come you chop and go * * Dis your love na roller coaster * * Food wey sweet na mama cook am * * But this boy na devil cook am * * I no know wetting i see - Oh, thank you, bye bye. - But why? - Don't you know her? She owns this place. * I no be mumu, no be mumu * Ma shemileshe * Ma shemileshe * Ma shemileshe * I no be mumu, mumu - Tina, what about my invites? - Yes, they've all been sent out and all the bloggers are looking for their invite. - No, no, no, please. I only want Uche of BellaNaija and Linda there, but Uche is out of the country so that leaves Linda. - She canceled. - What? No way. Oh my God, I'm gonna call her right now. - Oh, and Stella would like an invitation. - (laughing) Fat chance. - So I told her that they'd be delivered by a special messager, Scheduled to arrive soon. - Oh, you learning baby cakes. Give me five. Psyche. Give me my phone. - Happy birthday Lara Giwa, welcome. - Hi, how are you? - I'm good. - Cool. So as you know, today's my birthday, but we're gonna be celebrating for the whole month. - Okay. I've heard about a party tonight. So how are we dressing this sexy body of yours? - Well, I was thinking something along the lines of... - You got it, let's go. - Good afternoon everyone. How's it? - I thought this meeting wasn't supposed to start until about 30 minutes from now. - Maybe you overslept. - Maybe your Knock off Rolex didn't tell you the correct time. - What did you say? - I said next time I'll try and be early. - Exactly. - Hello everyone. Was anybody able to review my proposal and the beta site I sent? I think really we should go digital. - Good, that's adorable. We have an issue here we are trying to settle, you can see? - Yeah, this is a real issue as well. I'm trying to reiterate that media is going digital. We can't be dinosaurs. We will get extinct. - Okay, we don't understand. (Yoruba) You're dumb but they say you write well We don't understand. Can't you see, are you blind? - As a result of the refusal of Giwa Media Group to perform their civic responsibility, we have obtained a warrant of distrain on this building and everything inside it. By the Lagos States Internal Revenue Service. - Sir, we'll advise that everybody vacate this building with immediate effect and please leave every document exactly where they are. - Sorry, sorry, hold on, hold on. Tax fraud? How long has this been going on? - An estimated five years now. - Excuse me? Five what? - Shortly after your parents. - Your father was renowned for his honesty. We suspect someone has been exploiting the tax system. - Somebody from this company and apparently absent at this meeting. - Uncle Tunde. - You focus on Tunde and your sister Lara. (Yoruba) The crazy compulsive Shopaholic (tense music) - Who else knows about this? - Did you send it? I didn't get it. (panicked muttering) - This cannot be happening. Who is spreading this vicious rumors? You need to find out who's spreading these lies. - It looks like Stella. In fact, it has her written all over it. - Oh my goodness, It's everywhere. - Or maybe even this, Trish. - If I slap you. You too you're talking. Everybody knows that you secretly hate your boss, so maybe it was you. - I hate you actually. - And right there. There is your motive. Right there. - It's not true. I don't know why you like spreading these vicious rumors - Tina, why are you speaking? - and you've got such an evil mouth. Why, why? - Shut up. Just shut up. My life is a mess and you are arguing? I need to call Tunde and then he's going to sort everything out. It's just a mistake. It's a misunderstanding. Oh my God, Dara. - More on the prices rocking the embattled Giwa Media. Reports have it that the company owes approximately 75,000,000,000 Naira. There are many questions and speculations as to how such a vast quantity could have been so grossly mismanaged. (man speaking foreign language) (people talking over one another) - Hello? No, it's not us, it's our fathers friend. We're okay, thank you. - Thank you - You're welcome. - Look, I can't answer any questions right now, so please don't ask me anything confidential, I have no comment. - It's okay, I don't expect you to know. Maybe your father never really spoke about me, but I am an old family friend. - Oh, okay. That's nice but I'm sorry I don't remember. - It's all right. I might be able to help you with your crisis. - Oh sorry, I have to take this. - Dara. - Lara, just breathe. Okay. Don't worry, your birthday party's still happening. I'll sort it out. - They all want to see me go under and it's not gonna happen. Yes, Kemi, what's up? Why'd you keep calling me? I know, I saw it. Don't worry. Everything is being sorted out. My sister is on it. Can someone go park that car? My shoe. Yes Kemi. It's a rumor. It's a rumor. It's not true. These shoes, think I'm gonna have to give them to one of these servants. Hi, Kemi please, stop overreacting. What's wrong with your shirt? Why is the collar like that? Fix it or you're fired. Thank you. Come on ladies, the drinks are inside. Don't worry, I'm coming, I'm right behind you. Can somebody get us some rosé and some dragon fruit? Quickly. Oh, and if anything in this house is missing, you're all fired. Do you hear me? Thanks. - I have a proposal to help you save your company. - Do you mind if we push this to later? I have to speak to my uncle about it first. - But of course. Take your time, but don't leave it too long, okay? Here's my card. When you make up your mind, my number is in there. Give me a call. - Thank you. You can drop me off at this junction. - Okay. - Thank you. - Say hello to Tunde for me. - I will. - Tell him Fadekemi said hi. - (laughing) Yeah babe. Oh no, that has nothing to do with us. It's all a misunderstanding. Seriously. Yeah, of course we're fine. Don't be silly now, we're wealthy. We're rich. We're richer than, than, we're rich. Yeah, of course the party is still happening. Are you crazy? My party. (horn honking) - Uncle Tunde. (machine whirring) Uncle Tunde, what's going on? - Dara, my favorite Giwa. - Are you going somewhere? - Yes, unfortunately I have to go and take care of some business. - Please tell me it is about this tax fraud allegations we're getting. - No, well, yes, exactly. I'm gonna have to sort this out, but I have to leave the country on business for a while. You know, just a few days. - Okay, are any of these documents from our company? - Omodara. Sorry honey. I don't mean to be rude, but these are my personal records and they need to be, I've been advised legally to destroy them. I mean, these things happen, yeah? Look, well, it's okay. I promise. I was hoping to reach you before you saw it all in the news and got worried, but I couldn't get to you. You know these networks, blah blah, blah. Terrible, terrible. In fact, I was just about to drive to your house. Can you imagine, huh? - Really? Because you know that the board of directors are accusing you? - Of course they are (Yoruba) Hopeless and useless fools That's exactly what they want everyone to think. Look sweetheart, don't worry . Okay, it's just our competitors trying to sabotage the good name of the Giwa Media Empire. Looking for every opportunity to interrupt, but don't worry. In fact, you know what I would do? I would call Ayo and Tunde (Yoruba) The tax bosses and i went to the same college. (Yoruba) I graduated ahead of them. I mean what's the big deal? Okay, now look honey, I have to rush now. I have to go see why these banks are using themselves as pawns to discredit my, our great name. I mean, it doesn't makes sense, right? (laughing) - Okay. - All right, look, don't worry. Everything will be resolved and restored in a couple of weeks, I promise. - Okay, fine. But let me know when the banks are sorted so that I can get Lara's party back on track. - Of course I will. - Don't forget to call her, you know it's her birthday. - She will be the first to know. Okay, listen, don't worry, I will call Lara. - Have a safe trip. - Okay, be good. Chao, chao, uncle loves you. - Bye. - And it's already trending. - #Giwagate. (laughing) - Oh my God, oh my God, #Giwadoubletrouble. - #Giwasfallapart. (laughing) - Honey, don't laugh, it's not funny. - Nobody is creative in this world anymore. Nobody. Like there aren't even any good hashtags anymore. - Not at all. - Oh my God, Linda has already blogged it and it is not good. - Trish. - Please don't break our nails. - How is it that everybody knows about this so quickly? (girls talking over one another) - I'm so sorry to interrupt. - What is it Patience? - The bank sent their men. They're giving us just an hour to vacate. - What? - Yes. - Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Come back here, where do you think you're going? Excuse me, excuse you. You can't just come into my house and start taking all my furniture. (screaming) (glass shattering) (screaming) Beyonce! Beyonce! Patience! (screaming) - Oh my God, it's already happening. That's fine Sal. Stop, stop. (people screaming) Sorry, what's going on? - Will you stop pushing us out of our own house? Dara. - Lara what's going on? - Dara, oh my God. They're kicking us out of the house. Where is Tunde? - He said he will handle this. We just need to lay low for a little while. - Lay low for a little while? Like how long for? - I don't know, like a couple of weeks. - Couple of weeks? - Yes, the photo album. - Okay. - Sorry. Please, you can take everything, but can we please just have our photo album? I beg you. - Have you lost the mind? Photo album? When I have over a thousand pairs of shoes and bags inside the house? My Hermès, my Capucine. (Pidgin) Shoes and Bags? (Pidgin) That's what worries you in your current situation? (laughing) - Please, please, please. If I-- - It's okay, it's okay. - Stop. - It's okay, you're going to injure yourself. - Please, for the sake of our parents, I beg you, please. - Please. - Because of you, because of you. - It's okay. (Pidgin) But you have to hook me up with a little something - No problem. - Yeah, okay. - Sorry Patience, can you please help me get it and keep it at yours until all of this is over? - Okay. - Thank you so much. - It's ok. - Patience, do not forget my Celine bag and my Hermès bag and my Louis V. and the Capucine, the deep red one. Deep red, don't forget. Make sure, hurry up, quickly, quickly. Right, whose house are we staying at now? Oh, Trish, you live closest. - Exactly. - I would love to but my cousins are staying over so there's just no space for you, sweetie, sorry. - All right. Well then, Jide's house it is. Thanks a lot friends. - Yeah, sounds good, tata. Come on guys. - Bye guys. We love you. Are we still having the party? - I'll call the vendors in the morning, Dara. Okay, we love you guys. - We love you too. - It's gonna be okay. - Well Sal is still here. - Who's Sal? - Sal, the car hire that's been driving us for years before his father passed away. - And I'm supposed to know him because? - We're homeless in case you don't know. - So Tunde has assured us that this whole thing will blow over within a week. - Yeah. - Yes. - Yeah, I said so that it is not possible. All that money, just finish like that. (laughing) You will sort it out very soon. I said so. Come and give her. You don't want juice? Go and put that back. It's all confusion, but he's not home. I haven't seen him since he came from... (Yoruba) where did he say he traveled to again? Gambia. I can't see him. I don't know where he is. Squash, squash, squash. (Yoruba) That's all he's concerned about these days. I don't understand. - Squash? When did he become your age? 20 year olds playing squash? So Ma, I was wondering if it was okay if we stayed for a few hours. Or a day? - Oh, ah, and you're fine, fine girls. I would take you if it's up to me, I would take you. - This will all blow over very, very soon. It's just that right now we just don't have anywhere to go. (Yoruba) How unfortunate. - But you people, you have relatives right? - No. - Not really. I mean the ones we know are in the village and... - There's no wifi, Ma, that's what that means. - Mommy. - Why you late? You left me here with your two ladies. - Mommy, ladies. How are you? - So you're alive? You're alive Jide? Sorry, I haven't called you. (laughing) - Yeah, have you literally been squashed for the past six hours? - Ah, he's not aware. He's been going out all night, every time. - Mommy, mommy why? - Jide, you really have no idea? - He doesn't know. - Anyway babe, I wanted to talk to him about something. - I hope it's about my-- Remember that university that we've been waiting for? The Cambridge. The letter. Is inside the house. They have accepted him. - Jide. - See, I don't know what's going on here. - We have nowhere to go. - Sorry, you have where? - We have nowhere to stay. We've lost all our money and we just need to stay somewhere. - Wait, wait, wait, mommy wait, wait, wait. What about the house in Admiralty? - It's gone. - It's gone? - Yes. - Queens's drive? Banana Island? (Lara crying) - Yes Baby. (Yoruba) Do you understand what is going on now? - Wait, oh Jesus Christ. - I just need someone to stay for a bit. - (Yoruba) Are you following what I am trying to tell you? - You don't have a hotel? (Yoruba) Listen, let me give you some advice. You know Orchid on the Island here. - Which Orchid - The one your father used to stay. (Yoruba) Boy get out of my way! Orchid. Orchid Hotel, there's one hotel there You'll be on the Island, right on the Island. No dismissing anything. It's cheaper then Intercontinental. You have your credit card right? - Thank you Mommy. - No problem. - Wait. (Yoruba) They are going to... - Thank you Ma. - Bye bye. (Yoruba) Get back here! - Sit down my friend. (Yoruba) Where are you going? (Yoruba) They are broke!!! - Keep your house, we don't need it, bye. - It's okay. Well, I don't know. We've been just... We're hoping that you could possibly like let us know. (tense music) - You know, I have never seen Jide play squash before in my life. The guy is such a liar. - Obviously. (Yoruba) Incompetent fool. Not that I know what that means, but you know. - Uncle Tunde has left town and I don't think he's coming back. (solemn music) (distant Afro Juju music) - Lara. - Is there anything else you want? - We'll be fine. Dara. Are you sure she didn't give you the address to hell? - I'm here just in case you guys need any-- - We'll be fine. - Hell would be sleeping under a bridge Lara. - Or on this street. Please, can we go inside? Ow, my heel. (pained yelping) Oh, hi, Patience. How are you? Can we go inside, please? (sighing) - Not to your liking? Perhaps we can arrange to get you some caviar and champagne? - No, no, the food is fine. It's just that she was meant to have her birthday party today and with everything that's been happening, she's just upset. - Yeah, the whole of Lagos knows of the VVIP party that was only for the entitled and-- - Tonye, stop it. - So Patience, are you going to teach me how to cook? - How old are you child? - I just turned 27, why? - 27. Good, very good. Hmmm, you see Tonye here. She's our youngest child and she's just a few months younger than you are, and what that means is that you will not come into my house and call my wife by her given name. Hmm? - That's what we've always called her. - Yes, in your house as an employee. In our house, she is Mrs. Minimah. - No, Patience is. Aunty Patience is fine. - And you can call me Mr. Minimah or Uncle Richard. Okay, okay? - Okay sir. - Good, and no need for the sir. - What now? - I don't know. Sleep and hope to wake up in our beds. - Where are you going? - We can't all sleep here can we? - So Where are you going to sleep? - Outside? - Maybe your bedroom. Oh wait, you're homeless. I'm going to sleep on the couch and I'm sure I'm going to get better sleep than both of you and don't worry, we have wifi. We're not from the village. - Sweet, what's the password? - #Giwagate. (Hiss) (Lara laughing sarcastically) - Interesting girl. - Yeah, some piece of work. - She's not afraid of you. - Not yet. You know, at least she has good taste, ish. (Lara sobbing) - Lara, I'm trying to sleep. - I can't sleep like this. There's no AC. Why is this happening to us? Do we deserve this? - I don't know but I have a plan, okay? - Does the plan include tying Jide to my car and dragging him through the streets of Lagos? Because that's my plan. - That'll be our backup plan. - Good. I miss her so much. I miss her so much. (solemn music) - It's okay. It's okay. (mellow music) * Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go * * While my feet are on the ground * * Set me free while I can still hear a sound * * 'Cause I didn't know before * that it could turn out * This way and I feel like it's all my fault * * It's all my fault * When everything you're feeling in your heart is pain * * It gets harder for you to believe in anything * * I have never been here before * * I'm still a stranger to this * Misery has walked through the doors * * And I'm still a stranger to this * * When everything you're feeling in your heart is pain * * It gets harder for you to believe in anything * * Whoa * When everything you're feeling in your heart is pain * * It get harder for you to believe in anything * - You will shout at the top of your voice - You will declare forth, - Dara, - In the superior - What is that awful noise? - Magnificently! - I don't know. - And prodigiously. Magnanimously powerful name. Amen, and you, you will open your mouth and tell the lord, every diseases. - Diseases, who has diseases in this house? - Inhabiting this home. - My voice! - [Richard! Fall, die! - Die, die, die, die, now, die, yes, die! Die, die, die, by fire, die, die, die, die, die! (Pilot light Ignition) (food sizzling) - Wow, if I didn't know better I would say you know how to cook. - I always snuck into the kitchen and begged the chef to teach me. He was so afraid of my father finding out. What? - It's obvious you have a question. (water splashing) - Okay. It's about my sister. Could you just make a small effort to be nice to her? I know she can be a bit difficult, but things have been very hard for her the past few years. - Are you serious? A hard life? Abeg. - No, I mean it, she doesn't like to admit it, but the death of our parents really shook her hard. And it's been very difficult for her, especially this year. - Look, I know that can be painful, but your sister doesn't look like someone who can be affected by anything. - You'd be surprised. She just doesn't like to talk about it. - So how do you know? - Because she talks about everything. I mean everything and last night she cried. She finally admitted that she missed our mom and that's the first time since the funeral. - Okay, I'll try to be nice. For you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. But mehn, it's funny. I mean to think that you're the youngest sister, that you grew up in the same house as her. - I defy both the nature and nurture argument, don't I? (chuckling) Nevermind. It's a joke my father used to make. - Okay. (children shouting) (Lara Screaming) - What's that? - Oh, look at my stuff. Aunty Patience. Thank you Sal. Thank you so much. Oh my God, Dara come and see this. - Is this? How did you get them? - Mrs. Minimah had asked if I could help bring some of your things over. - No, but you are the one who made it possible by getting permission for us to enter the property, so Sal is to thank for this. - Thank you. - Well okay. If I must say, well I've done a favor for one of the LIRS guys and he owes me one. - Oh, that's amazing. Thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. At least I won't look like a pauper for the next three days. Anyway, I hope you packed my Hermès. Very well, thank you very much. I'll take this. Goodbye everybody. Thank you, thank you, thank you. - I have to get back to work now. Say hi to her. - Thanks Sal. - Your welcome. - Bye. Grab a bag, grab a bag. (somber music) - What, what is it? Why are you following me? - (Pidgin) Madam, did you request an Uber. - I didn't ask for this kind of car. I wanted a 2018 car. (Pidgin) The car on my profile is my brother's car I used to collect my Uber license. But this one is good as well. Can't you feel the nice cool AC? It even has a radio - And you can use my cell phone to listen to music - Oh my God, oh my God, look. Just let's go. Abeg, abeg abeg. Let's go quickly. If anybody sees me. (people chattering) Come with me right now, come. Well sit down. - What the hell Lara? - Trish. - And what's with the disguise? - Trish, there're vultures everywhere. Vultures, vultures. They can smell my blood. They're all calling, texting. They all want me to comment. - Okay, so why don't you just expose your uncle? - Expose my uncle? That would mean that it's true, that we're broke. - So? - We're not. - You are broke. - No. The rumors, they're rumors, you know. - Look, that is what everyone is saying and everyone knows it. So you sitting here denying it, is not gonna to make it any less true. - Look, I came here for a favor. I need a favor. I need you to borrow me, I need you to borrow me some money. (Trish choking) - Wait, I'm sorry, what? - Just to tide me over and pay for some studio sessions. - (laughing) Lara Giwa, asking for money. This should be interesting. How much? - Hundred K. - (laughing) I'm sorry. - I'm glad you find this funny. - How much do you think a hundred K is gonna last you for? You probably have absolutely no idea how much anything costs. - I mean... - How about I make you a deal? Say I give you, I don't know, half a mil? - Ah, babe. You know what? I knew you were the true friend. Thank you so much Trish. - For the bag. - Eh? Are you... (Pidgin) Crazy? Like really? - You're not ready My what? This bag is limited edition and it costs over $15,000. I love this bag Trish. - This bag is over $15,000. Take it to the market and go and use it to buy cassava flour since it's so expensive. It's a deal, right? You pay back your loan and you get your bag back. You don't pay back. Well, it's a very nice bag. - I hate you. How could you do this to me? - A million. One million and it's a deal. - Throw in the sunglasses and we have a deal. - Are you trying to strip me naked? - Please be careful abeg, and waiter, please can we have a bag so she can carry her things? (laughing) Okay, so I'm gonna M-cash you the money. How much was it? No, what's your M-cash code again? - 402. - 402. - 0000. - Okay, slow down. 00. Okay, it's done. - Wow, I just got the alert. - You're still talking. I really hope that your album blows, because poverty is not interesting at all. Waiter. Please can I have a bottle of champagne? Your best bottle of champagne. - Yeah, you can drink it yourself and choke on it. - I was going to drink it myself. - Yeah, choke on it. - Be going, be going. - I hate you. - You can go get your taxi outside. (laughing) (hip hop music) (singer singing in foreign language) - Ibrahim, how far now? - Aunty Sussie. Good afternoon (Pidgin) Aunty Sussie. I'm sorry but I can't open the gate the boss is not in the office. - I know, I know, I saw him yesterday before he left. I just want to pick up something he left for me. I'll be quick. - Aunty Sussie, I apologize, but you can't enter today abeg. - C'mon now Ibrahim. It's important. I'm sure you've heard what's happening to us. - Aunty Sussie, you know I like you but... Please call my boss - Ibro please, I'll be quick. - Aunty Sussie Sussie! (Pidgin) You are the best. You are simply the best. Aunty Sussie. Aunt Sussie, (Pidgin) you know has you've hooked me up, I will open the gate for you. Quickly go inside, just five minutes is all you have. Only you. I don't know this other lady. (tense music) * My rich friends all fly overseas, for the weekend * * Rich friends, rich friends, I have rich friends * * Rich friends drive new benz, my rich friends * * Are all into business * My rich friends all fly oversea for the weekend * * Call my rich friends ole barawo * * Say their lifestyle is not straight and narrow * (speaking foreign language) (coughing) - Are you lost? - Do I look like I'm lost? No, I'm here for my... - Hey honey, you got the invite? (laughing) - What the bloody hell. - Of course. Yeah, yeah, it's strictly by IV but I got you one of course. - Excuse me. - Do you have an appointment? - I don't need one. Big Chi knows exactly who I am. - So you don't have an appointment then, miss? - Are you like the only person on this planet that does not know who I am? (Hiss) - No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay. I'll actually get someone to send clothes to you. - Oh-oh, no she did not. - It's okay. It's not a big, what the hell? Give me back my phone! - Not today. - Give me back my phone. - Tell him that Lara Giwa is here. - Give me back my phone. - Tell him. And put the AC on while you are at it. - Who do you think you are? Give me back my phone! - Do your job. - Beautiful ladies, beautiful ladies! No need to fight. There's plenty of me for both of you. - I told little miss Rihanna wannabe that you will not be seeing her without an appointment. - Oh Sade love. You and I know that in some cases. Of course, exceptions can be made, like her. (both laughing) - Hey, Mr. Ofili, how are you? - I'm good, I'm good. - Nice to meet you! I was meant to come earlier, but you know what the social circuit is like, right? Very demanding for people like me. - I know sweetheart. Of course you're Lara? - Lara Giwa, yes, nice to meet you - So wonderful lady - Yes. - Oh, do you have something for us? - Yes, me, myself and my talents. - I'm anxious to see them. You know what? Why don't you discuss it over dinner? My room? - Your room? - Or suite. I mean, just tell me wherever you feel comfortable performing. - Actually, I came for a record deal. - Yeah, right. - You need to shut up. - Of course. After performing, you can-- (smacks Bottom) (slaps striking) - Don't touch me, don't you ever touch me. - Who slapped me? - She's gone. - Lara, wait. - No. - Lara, wait. - No. - Come on, Lara wait. - What? - You're fast What is it? Are you stalking me? Because everywhere I turn I see you. - Stalk you, wow. - I thought you were the driver, my sister's driver. - I'm not stalking you. Wait, breathe. - What is this? What is this? - Breathe, breathe, - Why are you at the studio? - Lara chill, Lara chill. Yes I drive because that helps with the bills in the house. You know how Lagos is now? Okay, maybe you do know how Lagos is but that's a side hustle plus I also produce with Big Chi over here. - Mmhmm. - I'm serious. I made a mix tape and he liked it and we're here. - So what, you're one of these new artists or something? - I think so. - Sure, so what's your artist name? - What do you mean what is my artist name? - Nice bike. What is your artist name? You can't keep Salome can you? - First of all it's not Salome, it's Salome. That's number one. - Salami. - Salome and second of all, no, I'm not using that name. I shall go by Mr. Beats. (Lara laughing) (Salome beatboxing) Yeah, funny, funny. That's actually a street name I got, because I've been known to do stuff in the streets. - Really, okay. - Yes and you probably don't know because I just took a detour. I took another path after secondary school. - Right. - But you know we've met at a party before, right? - You and who? - You know what, nevermind. - Oh I hate that little guy, jeez. - But you know I would've punched him in the face if you hadn't attacked him though. I know that was a really messed up thing to do. - Yeah, I got to go. - Wait, wait, hold that thought. How about you go, but with me anywhere. Hello! Anywhere you want to go, home. Let me clean this for you. - Why were you carrying a trash bag earlier on because you know I don't trust you now, right? - Oh nah, they were just having a party for another artist. That's nothing, let's go. Trust me? - Trust you? - Yeah, let me clean this again for you. (soft music) All right, so hop on. (engine humming) * I just wanna show you, I just wanna show you love * - Did he say anything about the papers he was shredding? - He said they were personal, but I can't help but think that the timing is a little bit suspect. - It could be notices from the LIRS which explains why your company was blindsided. - Still don't understand why he would do this though. And this Arewa Media, do you know anything about them? - Yeah, they're a media company and most of their clients are foreign start up companies and independent film companies. Why do you ask? Do you think they involved somehow? - I don't know, maybe but I'm just not eliminating anything. That's all. - True. - All right, let me go get a drink. - Okay. This is getting rather interesting. Fadekemi West, she founded a media firm that used to handle live events. She used to do small events for Lagos state government. Then she started working with the federal government and within a few months she had hammered big time. - No, that name sounds familiar. Fadekemi... I've met her before. Coincidentally, it was the day that we were kicked out of the office by LIRS. - Are you sure? - Yes, she said that she was going to help us fix this. She had some sort of solution and that she was a friend of the family, but funny thing is I don't remember her, but she gave me her card that day. Yep, it's her. - This woman used to work for your father before she started her own company. - Then it makes sense, maybe she can actually help. You know what? I'll send her a text now. - Maybe not, maybe not. Hold on. - Why, what? - It's possible her offer is to buy you out. - Why would you say that? - From the look of things she stands to gain a lot from taking over your company. - What am I going to do? - You know what? We need to find a bank or an investor to float part of the company for a while whilst you raise funds to pay back those back taxes. - Do you know how much you're talking about? - Look, there's a guy. There's a guy we can call, one guy who works at LIRS. He's been scoping me. I'll call him tomorrow. I'm sure he can help us. Dara, Dara come. Look, you can't give up now. The war just begun. - War, thanks. * I just wanna hold you, I just wanna hold you * - Thanks, thanks for the ride. - You're welcome Whoa. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm good, I'm fine. - You sure? - Mmhmm. - All right, there's a session tomorrow afternoon in the studio. - Oh really? - Yeah. How about you come by, i play some tracks, you listen, we see what comes of that? - Yeah, okay, why not? - Okay, so do you want me to pick you up? - I'll let you know. * I just wanna be there to - Okay, so I'll just quickly dial my number here. - Okay, so thanks for the ride again. - Yeah, you're welcome. - See you tomorrow. - Yes, all right. - All right. - Bye. (engine roaring) * You love - I remember when this was taken. It was right after my first piano recital. - You look so cute. (girls laughing) Your smile there, like you side are... - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - Where have you been? - I went to the studio and then I kind of went for a ride. - What happened? - Only the end of my music career. - There's some leftover food if you're hungry. I can even come and serve it to you. - No, no, no. I'm not hungry. I think I'm just gonna get some sleep. - Well, Tonye and I made some progress today. We're gonna go talk to an FIRS agent and also some investors. - Oh, good for you. I sold my Hermes bag to that greedy cow, Trish. - How much? - Really? - I'm just being curious. - Anyway, I think I'm gonna just go and get some sleep so toodles. - At least she has her music. I lost my spot at my master's program, so my dreams of having a digital department are irrelevant. - You still have your camera. Do something with it. - Like organize a show or something? - Yeah. - I still have my computer and all I need to do is finish the edit. Well, thank you for today. - You're welcome. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night Aunty Patience. - See mom, I was actually helpful today. Dara, we'll go see that guy tomorrow, yeah? - Right. - Okay, good night. (energetic music) * Dance with me - Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die! * You look so sweet, paint my name * * On the wall of your heart (screaming) - Pay me, pay me, what you owe, Do I look like Rihanna! (screaming) * Time no dey, to dey think of your problems * * The more you think the more you feel inside * * Get your dancing shoes, let's make this moment count * * Oya, follow me (singing in foreign language) * Follow me (singing in foreign language) * Follow me Die, die, die, die, die, die Trish, die Trish, die, die Trish, die! (singing in foreign language) * Follow me (singing in foreign language) * Follow me (singing in foreign language) - I have to record my album. It's just you know, like there's just so much to do. Yeah, I can hear you. - Hey. - No comments, no nothing, move on. - Relax, I am not a reporter. - Okay, so? - Neither am I a blogger. I'm actually here to help you. - How? - I have money and you need money to get back to the fabulous lifestyle that you're used to. And of course, save your company. - Okay. I mean, okay and? - Hop in, let's take a ride. (tense music) - Okay, so what are you offering? - In two weeks the banks will be foreclosing, do you know what will happen? Everyone will call you and they will start devaluing Giwa Media. They will price it for peanuts. - What do you mean two weeks? I know we have longer than that. - No, you don't and I've had this information over, for a while now, but I still, wanted to be fair. - What's your price? What do you want? - Look at the figure. - What the... Okay, so I need to talk to my sister about this. - She already knows and your Uncle Tunde signed off on it too. - Where is that man? Like, we've been looking for him. - Irrelevant. We both agree this is the best thing for both parties. See, forget what Tunde said to me or even your sister's acceptance. You are the eldest. I think this should be your decision. It's a matter of respect for me, I said to myself, Lara, you should have the final say. (tense music) (chime ringing) - Abeg patience, abeg, patience, correct. - Right, sorry about that Jean. So like I said on the phone, I was hoping that you would be willing to host the premiere for my film. - Nah, it's a film right? - Well it's post-colonial critique on Nigeria socioeconomic landscape, you know? - Too much grammar. Too much grammar, grammar, grammar. So it's one of those depressing films about our country, right? - No. - Depressing. Yeah, you want to scare my customers away, right? Now listen, my customers are very, very, important to me. Okay, I want them jubilant. I want them inspired by la vida loca. Hey, hey, hey, la vida loca. See that way, they buy more drinks and more food. - Yes and I understand that. That's why I feel like my project is going to do that. - It's a tribute. It's a tribute highlighting the positive things that the Giwas have done. It reminds the people of the positive things that the Giwas have done and money from this project will be used to fund an Institute that will inspire the L'amour, the L'amour in local filmmakers. - Exactly. - And we need it for just one weekend, one weekend, a couple of hours. That's it. - That's it. - What's the value of your time? - Yeah. (laughing) Now you are speaking the language I understand. You see, you should have started with that. (energetic music) (singer vocalizing) - These pictures were taken just yesterday, so that means Uncle Tunde is still in town? - Yes, but he could still be leaving and you're right, they are definitely together and it looks like they've been for a while. And there's more. - What else? Just tell me. - Baby, I told you that I will follow you to that Seyi Shay concert-- (agent laughing) - How much? - I mean it's not about that. I mean that's part of it, but do you really want to know everything? - Yes. - All right. Now, I can't tell you my sources, but I know for a fact that her plan on stalling the investigation into the Giwa media tax fraud case as well as speeding things up with the bank to make you guys a bit desperate is not a recent ploy. - I wonder how long they've been planning this for. - Your guess is as good as mine. She's a patient woman and Tunde is a smart guy with all the access. - Do the FIRS, and bank about this. - I doubt it but even if they did, I don't think they would have enough evidence to make anything stick to Tunde and Fadekemi. Right now it just looks like the Giwa's have been avoiding paying tax for years. I'm sorry, but it's your family name on the line not theirs. By the way, have you guys tried the wraps here? These things are so good. (soft music) * Take it slow - Take it easy. This whole place gives me perspective, you know? - Really? - Yeah, university days, audience, pedestals, this, yes Give them bars. Like rap and there's an audience like you're giving them... but then after that whole high, you just jump right back into reality of how messed up things really are. It was actually crazy, hostel life, back and forth. Real life. You know the past doesn't always have to haunt us, right? It's also capable of inspiring us. - Are you saying I should be singing about my dead parents or something? - Oh no, I'm not saying that. - I know, I know. I know what you were saying. I know what you meant. I'm just saying that with everything that is going on, I don't even know who I am anymore. I don't even know if I ever knew who I was. - Maybe it's just about finding you. Where are you? - Where am I? I'm sitting here next to you and Mr. Beats. - That's Mr. Salome Beats to you. * She wasn't ready * But you reached out in me. Good intentions * * But you found it hard to wait * * And now she's gone - Are you sure we should give this guy 65% of our day's intake? I mean how am I supposed to raise any money? - Look, it's a very good location and you have a lot of traffic on the weekends. (engine humming) You rode a motorbike? - Yep, I did and I loved it. - Lara, I have some stuff I want to update you on. - Cool, yeah, I have stuff to update you on too, so I will see you inside. - Okay. All right, bye Sal. - Bye, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - So? - Yeah You want to relax maybe? - Sal, do I call you Sal or Mr. Beats? - Sal, Sal is just fine. - Okay, so Sal did you see the real me today? - A glimpse maybe. Okay, okay. Yeah, I saw something. I think we're on the right track. - Good. - Yeah, I think we're on the right track. (Phone chime) Oh, yeah, I have to go now. I need to hit up G-Diddy in the studio and yeah, because he's hooked me up with a gig this weekend, Gidi vibes. You should come through. - Come through? - Yeah. - Yeah. I don't think I'm ready to be found just yet, if you know what I mean. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Okay, I understand. Same time tomorrow, right? - Yeah. So, here's your helmet, you want it? - Nah, keep it. You'll need it next time. Bye. - Bye. (engine rumbling) - You did what? - She said you agreed now. - Of course she did. You got played. Since this whole thing started, all I wanted to do was make sure that we don't lose all that was left of our parents, but of course as usual you're too selfish to see it. - Calm down. Haven't you realized that your family of four has now shrunk to two? And out of the two, at least one of us is tired of living in this dump. - So your only solution was to sell our parents' legacy to an enemy of the family. A freaking corporate shark. - Shush, jeez. What is it with you? What are you trying to salvage anyway? There's nothing left, finito, it's done. Dad would have wanted us to be more comfortable than this. - You mean your comfort, because it's always been about you. - Oh, all right. Look, just because you run around playing CEO or corporate madam, whatever it is, you think you know something about running a corporate company? - Okay, please teach me miss liberal arts major. - Oh God Dara, look, you're the one that's always saying that we need to play a more active role in the business. - I wanted to do that, but you didn't care about anything but your stupid parties and your social media followers! - For gods sakes, you never cared before. It's not my fault that you have no friends, Dara. - No friends? I'm your only friend. - Oh god. - Your friends hate you. They complain to me all the time about how selfish and cruel you are but stupid me, I keep defending you even though I know that they are right and you know what? On that note, your music career is shit. (Lara laughing) I'm sorry. - You know what? It doesn't even matter. I've made the decision. I'm the oldest, so get that into your big head. Feel me? My decision is final. I'm the oldest. - Where are you going? - You know what? You think you're so perfect. You think you're so perfect. running around with your degrees and your stupid ass films that nobody understands, nobody, begging for mommy and daddy's approval. You're just as selfish as I am. Only, I'm more real about it. Toodles baby cakes. (hip hop) * Grap music * Because of your body no be small ting * * And my something no be small ting * * I fit to give you Buju Banton o * * I could you fuji some... Hi. - What are you doing here? (Lara sighing) - I need you to take me on a ride. On your bike. What kind of girl do you think I am anyway? - I think you are confident, strong, and hmm, and a beautiful woman. - Better, much better. (Sal laughing) (soft music) - I'm sorry you had to hear any of that. - Dara, you have to stop apologizing for your sister. She's a woman now and has to understand that while mistakes are free, there will be consequences. I have something to show you. come - Is this my-- - Yes, when your mother got you the grand piano she gave it to me so that Tonye could practice on it. She never took to it though. - (laughing) Wow. I used to love playing with the different sounds on this thing. - It drove your piano teacher crazy. - It drove everyone crazy. And I was so attached to it for some strange reason. Why do you care about us so much, Aunty Patience? - I have been blessed with 23 incredible years of watching you blossom into the incredible woman you are today, Omodara. (dramatic music) Your father considered you a rebel, but he was very proud of you. He was proud of your resilience and your ability to not give a challenge the last say over you. - It's just, there's so much happening so fast. - I know. - At least I had them to back me up. - Your parents believed in something different and I wanted to be a part of that. They believed in family. They believed in honor. They believed you and your sister could accomplish whatever you set your heart on as long as you had each other. I believe that too. (hip hop music) (singer vocalizing) (singer singing in foreign language) * These girls are wayward * just because I'm famous * They say butter entertain us * Cause that's what happens in Lagos * * These girls are wayward * Just because I'm famous * They say butter entertain us * Cause that's what happens in Lagos * * Bring rose, champagne, 10 bottles of Jameson * * I'm the last one standing * Go to Quilox, Escape, Rumors, velvet * * I'm the last one standing * Wonu Shrine, Won de fun Ms. Gucci * * I'm the last one standing * O de wonu Bedroom to check performance * * She say I'm outstanding * Alo ooh * Standard * Alo ooh * These boys, AKA Panty dropper Butter * * Always a show stopper, always gonna be a bottle popper * * Hands up, mi o ni o kpe olopa * * Don't have time for any motherfucker * * Small boys take notes in your jotter * * Get love from Lekki to Ojota * Don't believe when I say I love her * * These girls are wayward * Just because I'm famous * They say butter entertain us * Cause that's what happens in Lagos * - Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, what's up?

Like I let myself get played. By an enemy of my family All for the sake of my ego and this silly music. And Dara was right, I'm selfish and everybody hates me. But last night... - Last night was beautiful. You let yourself get found and even you were surprised. - Yeah, something like that. But you know, I only know how to be a bratty rich girl. (laughing) Like that's all I'm good at. - Yes, you were. You were very good at it. But on a serious note, it's easy for anyone to get caught up in that life, because it could happen to anybody. - Dara didn't get caught up. - You want some? Okay. - Like I used to hate how everybody would think that she was the oldest, and like she has always been more mature and the sophisticated Giwa. The one with all the potential. Thank you. - You're welcome. I guess all you have left is each other, and you can't let this break you. Plus I'm here and I have a high threshold for bratty rich girls. - Shut up. I'm sure you do. (laughing) - I got you. So, American breakfast. - Yeah, so I'm kind of on a diet. (both laughing) - Okay. Yes, what's that? - Okay, I need a baseball bat. - What? - I need a baseball bat. - Wait, first of all, we're in Nigeria, we don't play baseball. What's going on? - I need a baseball bat. - There's no baseball bat.

I'm just calling to say hi, find out if you're okay. Well, I'll call again. She's not picking up. She's not answering her calls. She's ignoring me. - I think you should invite her over tonight. - I've called and called. She's not answering. I'm not going to beg her. - Okay, then we should stop by her house. - I'm not gonna stop by the house either. I'm not ready for that. I'm gonna stay at your place until this album is finished and this whole thing blows over. - Yes madam. - Yes. (laughing) - But it's cool. You can stay for as long as you want. - Thank you. So look, tell me, what is it about you? Because I thought you were my sister's driver. Right? However you have like all these cars, your motorbike, your apartment's nice. So what's going on? Like is there something I'm missing? Driver? Are you a 419? (both laughing) - Technically, well yes I am a driver. Amidst many other things because when my dad passed, he left a lot of companies behind. And one of them is a luxury car service. - Oh wow. - - Hence... - Hence you being my sister's driver? - Yeah, but I'll be honest with you, I've just really wanted to be in the core of music. It's like it's just life. But then we also have to feed people and there are quite a number of mouths to feed. - Your family. Yeah, I get it. - Yeah. So it's a must, but it also can be very lonely. - Lonely? - Yeah. - So what? You drive people around so you can have company? - Really? (laughing) Yeah, yeah. (both laughing) No. But I drive you around because I want your company. - That's smooth. - But it's true. And if you let me. * This art, this art, this art * Art of love, This art, this art, this art * * Art of love, This art, this art, this art * * Art of love, This art, this art, this art * * Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready * (audience applauding) * Tonight with me...

(dramatic music) - You will love what we have done here. So you start up with us for our Midweek segment. Of course, that's the entertainment news. Like an Associate producer, you can call it a learning curve and... - Revised your script. Jonathan made some changes. - Better be good, for his sake. - What's going on? Miss West, I got your message but that's not why I'm here. - Why, you don't like entertainment news? - It's not that. I mean there's nothing wrong with it but... - Reverse, good. We want to tone it down a bit more and focus on the future plans for... What is she doing here? - That's a good question, Dara. What are you doing here? - I have an offer for you. - Interesting. - May we go somewhere private where we can talk? - I'll be in makeup. - All right ma. - Stop, it's not a fashion show. I can do this myself. - You manipulated my sister. - Simply liberated her from your shadow. Now she can shine on her own. - No, all you did was weaken our company so that you could buy it for cheap. (laughing) - You have no idea how these games are played, young girl. - But my uncle does and my guess is, that you got played too. Because he's right now with his family in Seychelles. Now, if you know where the money is, you and I can work together and hit him hard where it hurts. - I have no idea what you're talking about. What money? I have everything I need. - But you have no empire. - I have yours. And in 10 minutes I will announce that on a live television broadcast. What is this about? - I want all visual media departments. Television, film and streamed content. You can have prints and whatever else is left. - What is wrong with you entitled Giwas? You want? Take me. Why will I work all those years, this hard only to hand over content to you? - Because you were involved in the demise of our parents. - Excuse me? You know I'd never do anything like that. And if I were you, little girl, I'd be very careful walking around here throwing accusations with no shred of evidence. - See, what I've learned about being an heir to a media company is that you don't need facts. All you need are delicious breadcrumbs, just like this. I have the originals. (dramatic music) You have been sleeping with Uncle Tunde, who is now a criminal and a fugitive. Imagine the headlines. You and Tunde plotted the death of the Giwas. You see, after our parents died, you started your company, which in the matter of five years has swallowed ours with the help of your married lover who also happens to be the trustee to our estate. So all I have to do is feed the audience with all of these breadcrumbs. You see Lara? My sister? She has tons of followers. Fans, clients, artists, you name them. They are hungry and I will feed them these breadcrumbs and they will vomit toxic publicity all over you. Hashtag. - It's time to get on stage. (dramatic music) - Hashtag Fadekemi has fallen. This is about that media empire, isn't it? You're going to need our help. You either be a colonizer or an actual liberator. Your choice. You've got less than 10 minutes. (Fadekemi sniffling) My sister, she has tons of followers, fans, clients, artists, you name them. They are hungry and I will feed them these breadcrumbs and they will vomit toxic publicity all over you. Hashtag Fadekemi has fallen. (rain pattering) (hip hop) * Grap music * Because of your body, no be small ting * * And my something no be small ting * - Sal, Sal! I told you, I told you, I told you. - What's the meaning of this? Oh. Oh, you think you can come to my studio and slap me again? Because your father owns Lagos, right? - Sal, what is this? - And you. You think you can use my studio to be moonlighting as a producer? Abeg, give me my food. - Yes sir. - I don't blame you. - Sal. You need to talk to me now. Sal, what is going on? - Oh, both of you think you're smart? - I'm sorry. - If I count one to 10 and you are still here and you don't disappear, (Pidgin) I will cut you into bits and use you as Barbecue. Diddy, search his bag. - Sal, please can you explain what's going on 'cause I'm confused. - Oh, oh, he lied to you too. (laughing) Let me have them. They now belong to me. - We made those stuff, I recorded them at-- - You cannot do that. - But Boss, we made those beats. I didn't even use any of your studio equipment because-- - Lies. You created lies and disrespected me in my own studio with my own equipment. (Pidgin) Can your father afford a synthesizer? (Pidgin) You must be crazy. My friend just scarraway. (Lara yelling) (hip hop) * Grap music * Because of your body You know what? Any beats created in my studio belongs to me. Do you hear this hot track? Wow wow wow wow wow! * Give you Buju Banton o * I can give you Fuji something * * Take my love - Lara, wait! Wait! - Hello, is this the cab? What! After everything you put me through! You humiliated me! After everything I've lost. (thunder rolling) Who the hell are you? Nothing is real, nothing is real with you. No, get off me. - Lara, we are real, we are real. The music is real. (Lara sobbing) I mean you show me a new side to me in the studio everytime. We are real, this is real. This is real. (thunder rolling) (horn honking) * You may call me crazy (knocking) - You know what I shouldn't have come, I... This is a bad idea, I'm gonna go and call my sister. - Lara, wait. I'm sorry. - I know I can be obnoxious. Like I know I can be rude and... (Trish chuckling) - You really can. Well, I was having some wine, and I ordered a pizza. Would you like to come in? - Thank you. I'm so soaked, thank you. - Thank you so much. Ew, you're wet girl. - I know, it's raining outside. Who's this dress by? - I don't know, I've had it for like 10 years. (both laughing) - Where is that wine? * Oh my god I've been in this way too deep * * All these fantasies might be the end of me * * Come close, baby, let me tell you something * * Omoge no dey put me on a long ting * * When you know I got everything you wanting * * Bad Bridge got the money in abundance * * All this misery has got a nigga wondering * * So good you gotta sew it on a bun ting * * When you know I got the money in abundance * * Money in abundance * Everything you're wanting, I been missing * - Man I'm glad you called. You know, I saw that your video, Gidi Vibes. - Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah. - And your YouTube video? - Yeah. - At that nightclub. - At the nightclub, yeah. - Dope. - Thanks. - So listen, tell me about your beats. - Oh that. So my homeboy G Diddy, hooked me up with Big Chi's Studio to be able to work with Lara Giwa. Long story cut short we got busted, and Big Chi kind of like took everything. - Just like that? * Down for, down for man like * See she always stay down for man * Anyway, you know I manage Cashflow right? - (chuckling) Wow, I do now. - The Cashflow. - To think one would see you as maybe like a lawyer or? - Baba Walo, Baba Walo! - Cashflow. (Cashflow chuckling) This is my guy Sal. - Hey. - He rescued me from some thugs, some bikers that were harassing me one day like this. (Pidgin) Baba Walo, Bikers were harassing you? Here in Lagos? (Pidgin) You should have told me. I would have taken a golf club to their heads. Are they crazy? * Down for man like, down for man * (Pidgin) Isn't this the guy who had that viral video? (Pidgin) Dude you've got some talent there. (Pidgin) Baba Wale C'mon give me this beat. Guy let me sing the hook? - Exactly? - I said earlier that Big Chi kind of like, took everything. - Listen, I want you and Lara to come and be part of the team. - Really? So I and Lara kind of like had a fight. - Woman. - You work on getting Lara back, alright? We'll get the beats. (chuckling) - Welcome to the family. - Have a drink my G, great guy. (Yoruba) Eat some plantain - Olisa, I told you. Big Chi is the Don Dada of Naija music. My dear, just do this song and the world would go crazy. - Yeah.

Like, really? - Trust me this time, it's not a lie. - This time. What about all the other times that you've lied? And all the other times that you're gonna lie? It's like you just don't know when to stop. - Lara, listen-- - I'm sick and tired of this illusion of reality. What is wrong with you, you're a prolific liar? - Okay yes I did lie, hoping that we'd get like a record deal from Big Chi. - Really? - I swear to you this time I'm not lying, Lara. I've gotten our album back. * Do you know - What did you have to do to get that back? - Let's just say (Yoruba) Big Chi had a visit from Karma. - What does that, what does that even mean? - I beg your pardon. Let's just say he had a change of heart. A quite rapid up and down type change of heart.
