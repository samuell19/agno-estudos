(speaking in foreign language) I can now say to you that the American people today realize that these stories are untrue and without foundation. (speaking in foreign language) Oh yes, I am old visitor of Germany, and I have come here so as to talk over the radio from Germany to America that the true facts may be given to the American people so that they will have the story of today and what's going on here.

And for better than two and a half days they've been speeding through the skies over miles and miles of water here to America. Now they're coming in to make a landing of the Zeppelin. I'm going to step out here. As I move out, we'll just stand by a second. Well here it comes, ladies and gentlemen, to us now and what a great sight it is, a thrilling one. Just a marvelous sight coming down out of the sky. It's pointed directly towards us and toward the mooring mast. The might diesel motors just roared, the propellors biting into the air and throwing it back into a gale-like whirlpool. The ship is no doubt bustling with activity, as we can see. Orders are shouted to the crew, the passengers are probably lining the windows, looking down at the field before them. - Here's the mooring now. - [Radio Announcer] Getting their glimpse of the mooring mast. The back motors of the ship are just holding it, just enough to keep it from-- (fire roaring) Get this, Charlie, get this, Charlie! It's burning and it's crashing. It's crashing, terrible. Oh my, get out of the way, please. It is burning, bursting into flames and it's falling on the mooring mast. (Hindenburg crashing drowns out speech) Oh, it's a terrific crash, ladies and gentlemen. The smoke and the flames now and the frame is crashing into the ground, not quite to the mooring mast. Oh the humanity, and all those passengers screaming around it. I told you, (flames roaring) I can't even talk to people whose friends were on there. (roaring flames drown out speech) I can't talk, ladies and gentlemen. Honest, just can make no sense of the smoking wreckage. (groans) I'm gonna have to stop for a minute because I've lost my voice. This is the worst thing I've ever witnessed. (crowd chattering) (crowd shouting) (dramatic drum music) - Pledge undivided allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. Go after him. (crowd shouting) Attention. Attention. (crowd shouting) (ominous orchestral music) (crowd applauds) - The technical problem of securing and maintaining peace, but also face the important task of education and enlightenment. Without such freedom there would have been no Shakespeare, no Goethe, no Newton, no Faraday, no Pasteur, and no Lister. (crowd applauds) (wind howls) (speaking in foreign language) (motor rumbling) (speaking in foreign language) (Goering laughs) - [Radio Announcer] Today's news of the international situation is entirely dominated by this announcement with which Mr. Chamberlain ended his speech in Parliament this afternoon after a special message had been handed to him. Herr Hitler has agreed to withhold (speaking in foreign language) mobilization for 24 hours. And on his invitation, Mr. Chamberlain, (speaking in foreign language) Senor Mussolini, and Monsieur Daladier are meeting him at Munich tomorrow. (speaking in foreign language) At this point, the whole House rose, cheering and waving order papers. (speaking in foreign language) When the cheering had subsided, Mr. Chamberlain told the House, "I hope the House "will release me now (speaking in foreign language) "to go and see what I can make "of this last effort that we have. "Perhaps we may meet (speaking in foreign language) "in happier circumstances." (speaking in foreign language) The House is adjourned until Monday amid scenes, perhaps an example for enthusiasm and emotion. (speaking in foreign language) When Mr. Chamberlain acknowledged the applause that greeted him later in Downing Street, he cried to the crowds, "It's all right this time." (crowd shouting) - This morning I had another talk with the German Chancellor, Herr Hitler. And here is the paper which bares his name upon it as well as mine. (crowd cheers) Some of you perhaps have already heard what it contains, but I would just like to read it to you. We regard the agreement signed last night and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again. - [Spectator] Three cheers for Chamberlain! - [Man] Hip, hip! - [Crowd] Hooray! - [Man] Hip, hip!

You will now hear a statement by the Prime Minister. - [Neville] This morning, the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock, that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us. (avalanche roaring) I have to tell you now, that no such undertaking has been received and that consequently this country is at war with Germany. Now may God bless you all and may He defend the right, for it is evil things that we shall be fighting against, brute force, bad faith, injustice, oppression, and persecution.
