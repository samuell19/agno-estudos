Boys, it's Saturday. It looks like nothing's happening tonight. There's nothing to do but stay on the lookout This guy's not afraid of the river or the doorstep. Very funny. I'm definitely not going to die of laughter. Or from work, like your old man says. What's the point of working? What does your old man think? What's he going to think... he's like everyone else in the neighborhood. He wants me to get my degree and forget everything else. I'll work for him at the firm and who knows, maybe someday I'll be a judge. If you don't fall dead on the doorstep first. Hey... Let's go to the cafe. You're just like everyone else in the neighborhood. Everybody says it, man, that chick... Enough. Don't be an idiot. I'm leaving... Sit down. Don't get all bent out of shape. A Martini. Coffee. What are you drinking? Another Martini. I'm sorry. Really. Stop fooling around, kiddies. Are you going to fight over some chick? Those rumors were probably started by some old resentful hag. There's always one of those. What do you think about the two guys that died? What do you want me to think? It's one thing for one boyfriend to die on a girl, but two? One on her doorstep and the other jumping into the river. Anyone would say you think she killed them. There are many ways to kill someone. Keep talking until you knock yourselves out. She and I really don't care. There's really nothing that strange about it. You have to understand that, Delia. Everyone says the same thing. What they don't say is what it means to understand. Delia, how is it your fault that Rolo had a bad heart? I don't know. You were too good to accept him as a boyfriend. I didn't accept anything He came by and I was lonely... Delia... it's not your fault what happened with Rolo or Hector. You worry yourself sick. You heard what your old man said today. It could happen to anyone. I had a friend, Suarez, that... I already told you, didn't I? The one whose fianc√©e died the night before the wedding... I liked that rabbit. If you had brought it today we would have it in the patio and we wouldn't be arguing... You ask for miracles, Delia. What do you want me to do? They sold it this morning... There was another one but it didn't have the red eyes like you like. I liked the white one. They promised me they would find one just like it in the next few days. You know I do everything you want. That may be, but every time I feel more alone... How long are you going to blame yourself for something you didn't do? The blame, the blame, you're always to blame. I know you haven't said it so many times, but it seems to me that I always hear you say it. It's not that it's my fault, Mario. Sorry, but look at the way you hold your hands. I don't know, this house, even your parents... It seems that they want you to be right. You know these things happened. There are times when I'm with you, mostly when I'm with you, when it feels like a weight, a burden. We don't have to call it blame, but it is in this house in my parents, it clings to my clothing. You see? You yourself know it, even though you're still in black and you continue remembering all the time what happened. Tell me, why do you still dress in black? Delia, did you hear me? Why, Delia? What time is it? Almost eleven. Man, let's not waste time. She's not coming to mass. She wouldn't dare. The old women would rip her apart. Look at that. The little neighborhood saint. You mean the little widow. Go. Talk to her. What are you waiting for? Your funeral? It's you. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you... Delia. Apparently, you also know my name. Why "also"? Well, because you seem to know a lot of things... Names, how to swim... you swim well. I was watching you this morning. A friend of mine is a member of the Regatta Club and sometimes we go. It's good to know how to swim, of course. Do you know how to swim? You should learn... What for? I don't like the water. I've wanted to meet you for some time. I mean, to talk with you, because I already know you... We've seen each other before. Yes, we have. What are you always doing on the corner? What are you always looking at on the corner? Delia... You have all the time in the world... Like me... You're always behind the curtains. Yes, all my time behind the curtains... and the people go by. The neighborhood is like that. It's wonderful to have extra time. But you say it so sadly. Perhaps we're talking about different times. Or the same one. But on both sides of my curtains... Don't take me too seriously... Why shouldn't I take you seriously? I like when you talk like that, not as if you were speaking from far away. It's incredible that we live only a block apart and this is the first time we are speaking. What's incredible is that we meet here, so far from Buenos Aires. Perhaps because there are no curtains on the beach... Perhaps. You... are you comfortable speaking familiarly? Almost immediately. With many people? No. Now I don't. If you don't want to explain, you have your reasons. You are too beautiful for someone to try to understand you, too... What do you really think of me, Mario? Doesn't it occur to you that I also think of you in a very special way? You don't seem to care about that. I could also see you like something distant. Something unreal. This doesn't matter to you, of course. If you want I can be very real. Both of us could. At times I think that's what you want. But each time I try to hold you... What would happen? What would happen? You are so silly! So pretty and so silly! Everything is in the past for you. Or it's far away or it will pass. You never speak of now. Of what is happening now. What are you afraid of? Nothing. On the contrary. It's more like... It's cold. It's late. I can be gone, but you must always be here. Do you like them? They're beautiful. The ugly thing is that they are closed in. My parents like them that way. They like everything that can't escape. Some glass here, some glass there. Me, on the other hand, I like to touch things. Feel things. Even though they say it brings bad luck. They die soon, you know. Do you believe in bad luck? Sometimes. Once Rolo gave me an adorable little rabbit. It died a few days later. Did Rolo give you many gifts? Yes... until Mother forbade it. And then... well... he gave me gifts in secret. And Hector? No, Hector didn't. He only spoke. He gave me words. But you went into mourning for Hector. Instead for Rolo... So? What does it matter now? I don't know. It would seem that you felt more for Hector... This one is going to die soon. Why don't you answer me? I already did... I don't care about that stupid fish. I don't care if it dies or not. I want to talk about us. But you spend all your time talking about others... about Rolo, about Hector. You don't talk about anything else. That's the only way we ever talk about us... Delia... Kids, it's very late. Yes, ma'am. I was going. See you later, Mario. See you later, ma'am. Come. I'll walk you. Why not, Delia? Not here. Why not here, Delia? Why not here, Delia? Stop. I said, let go. Don't you understand that you're harming yourself? You're not a child who... Was it you? Tell me if you did it. Are you crazy? Why would I send you a thing like that? Just as a joke. If Julio told he didn't do it, then he didn't. Why would he lie? So who sent this to me? The holy ghost? Lighten up, Mario. I don't make those kinds of jokes. I'm sorry. Really. Try one at least. I made them just for you. Honestly, Delia, I don't feel like it. The doctor said... Sorry, I swore I wouldn't talk to you about the doctor again. You're going to think I'm some poor old sick man. They're mint. The kind you like. Okay then. Give me the smallest one. I find it all the work you put into these amusing. All the time you spend on the liqueurs... Would you prefer that I knit you bed jackets? You know that I love your candies No, you smell of mint. People would say that you prefer the dead... Go on. Say everything you want. Make me suffer. Be like them. They also made me suffer like you are doing now. You're driving me crazy. Why would I care about them? If we at least could speak... But, no. Just telling me "Rolo likes orange Liqueur"... Don't you realize that you are making me suffer? I don't care about what happened to Rolo. What about what happened to Hector? You don't care about Hector's death either? Stop exaggerating. You women see the drama in everything. It's just that Hector committed suicide, Vicente, and no one could ever explain it. What do you want me to explain? That Hector and Rolo died? You already knew that. I don't want you to explain anything to me. I want you to be real, like me. I don't want you to give me words, like him. Is that you, Mario? Yes. Did you eat already? Yes... no, I didn't... but I'm not hungry. Come into the living room for a minute. Your father and I would like to talk to you. Not tonight, Mom. I'm very tired. I'm going to bed. Are you going out again? I'll be right back. I'm going to buy cigarettes. He can't stand himself either. What can we do? Once you get an idea in your head... Look, Vicente, I thought of something... I hope that our dropping by doesn't seem strange. But since Mario often comes to your house, and you know how kids are nowadays... No need to explain, Madam. So among the four of us, it's better that we don't say anything to them. Nowadays, young people care little about family. In the past Delia used to like to sew. She used to make lampshades. She's changed a lot. Now the only thing that interests her is the piano. And candies... they say she makes delicious candies. They say? You know, at our age, chocolate... She plays piano wonderfully. But it's just a way of wasting time, you know. Nobody knows how to waste time like women. Yes... raising children requires a life of sacrifice. This was my mother-in-law's house... Those are some fish Delia received as a gift. Imagine living so close to someone and not knowing them. Of course it is better not to say anything to them. Retirees, you know... You have a cat, too? They get themselves sick licking their fur. I give that one castor oil. It's the only thing that makes him better. I don't understand why we went. We ended up not saying anything to them. There must have been twenty times that I wanted to start a conversation. I think they did it on purpose. A lot of talk about flowers and cats, but we don't know anything about Delia. We didn't go about it the right way. Maybe if they visit us... Hello, Mario. What are you doing here? How's it going? You'll see. They gave you a day off? Do you know her? Raquel, Mario... How do you do? Come, let's dance. Hello. - Susana. - What? So that's Mario? What's the matter with him? Julio says he is in love with some girl who already sent two boyfriends to the cemetery. The two together? They say she's a jinx, not a bigamist. Excuse me. Do you always enter like that? Really, I'm sorry. Take me to dance. I don't have to forgive you. I never lock the door. I'm a typical woman, you know. I'm tired. You're going already? Yes. Can I give you a ride? Now what? Tell me. What? What's the matter. You're the one who doesn't seem normal. What's normal? Normal is open a door and leave it open. Not close it immediately like you did. Call it a lack of time. Call it what you want. What about him? Wasn't he the one who was so in love? Why do you ask? Don't play dumb. You know why I ask. Mario... why did you come up? We can't be so quiet now... Let me be. I guess you don't call everything whatever you want. What did you do all day? Did you go out with Julio? Yes. On his yacht? Yes. Just the two of you? Don't tell me you're jealous. Just the two of you? Delia, what are these questions about? What all questions are about. I like to know. Hector and Rolo told me everything they did I'm alive. I'm not Hector or Rolo. No? What are you? Mario. That is "who'' you are. I asked you "what" you are. Delia... please don't use that tone. Or do you want me to think you prefer the dead? At times I do prefer them. When I think that they don't ride on yachts anymore. They are more mine than you. More yours than I am. That's why you don't want to stop mourning. Even though time moves on if I saw myself in a mirror with a white dress on, I would feel dirty. But your mourning is almost offensive to me, please understand. Just like not knowing what I did today offended you. It's been three months since we met that we've been seeing each other almost every day. You say it with such pity. It's funny to me that you're so sentimental. You're as sentimental as I am. You've taken shelter in this way of living... I don't know how to explain it. Delia, in spite of your mourning you are white but you've closed yourself in silence and mourning and in not wanting to understand anything. That's how you see me. But you're the only one in the world who sees me that way. Isn't that enough? What do we care about the rumors? What rumors? Those lies which people sometimes believe are true. Do you think the weather will be nice tomorrow? Why are you changing the subject? Silly, I was thinking about going out on the yacht. I've never been on a yacht. It's one of those things that you only see in the movies. Is the river very deep? I don't know. But this is the life. Breathe the air. Pure Sunday air, better than nothing. You've become quite the philosopher. Do you always have to tolerate him like that? You must have a lot of fun together. They aren't like us. Some people have fun with their heads and some with their hands. It seems like you've made your choice. We'll flip for the cabin? No. You go ahead. You don't have to convince me. Really, go ahead, buddy. What about you? I'm one of those people who has fun with my head. Don't think their happiness comes easily. Susana works at "La Mondiale" and he runs around like madman trying to save for the wedding. With her? And why not? Well... he is very nice. But I'm not convinced he's that serious about her. "How serious he is." What are you talking about? I love you, I would marry you, but not for that... Susana is Susana. Me... take a look. It's something else. You always like to make me suffer. It's late, Hector, leave. Mother is listening nearby. As always. As always. The two of them spying on us from behind the door. I'm not free, Mario. I'm tied to something. To myself. For once, listen to me. You aren't tied to anything. It's your damned house, your parents, this atmosphere, your black dress, always the same, the piano, the cat... If you married me, you would free yourself from... I'm talking seriously, so listen to me. If you loved me just a little, nothing more than a little bit... You know that Uncle Horacio's house will be mine. Won't it be fabulous? It will be difficult the first few months but with love, it'll be bearable. Aren't you going to say something? Then give me a kiss. Enough, Rolo, you bore me with the same thing all the time. I really don't understand you, Delia. And then you say you are sick of it. Of your house, your parents. I say it, but sometimes we say things that mean other things, other things that I don't even understand... A pure misunderstanding! The wind will destroy the house if we're not more careful. It will rain at any minute now. Why did you put the chairs out? To paint them. Look at this one, it's half broken. Now it's late but tomorrow we'll ask the old man next door for a hammer and between the two of us... Oh. It's you. You came later than usual today, Hector. I couldn't wait for you to get here. What's the matter? You don't look so good. Do you feel sick? I don't know. I didn't sleep last night. Why? Some bad news? I don't get any news. Neither good nor bad. Nobody writes to me. Did your parents do something? Lately we barely speak. I don't know. They are very nice... but sometimes... Promise not to get mad if I tell you something? Sometimes I think they're spying on us. Who knows? It's like there's always someone else around, other than us. Always someone spying... of course, one can understand... Your parents, even if they trust me completely... Delia, what's the matter? Delia. Now you are starting with your foolishness... Don't pay it any mind, Mario. She's so nervous today. I should go. No. Why are you going to leave? My husband was just thinking of having some vermouth with you. Have some while we wait. He went to ask the neighbor for a hammer. Have some. Delia... I think what you said about my parents was funny. Do you think I believe that's what you found funny? That wasn't why you laughed. And you weren't really laughing, deep down you were crying. Why? Because we're never alone the way you want? What do you mean like I want? You should want it, too. And you do want it, I am sure. You are always sure of things. Not always. I like that you think everything is like knowing how to swim and knowing the names of people. You're wrong. There are a lot of things that I don't understand because of you. When I was talking about your parents, that wasn't what I wanted to say. They aren't the only ones spying on us. Why don't you help me to free you? Say their names. Shout them out until they leave you alone. Rolo! Hector! Rolo, Rolo, Rolo! They are the ones who are spying on us, and you know it. Mario! Mario! Come. Come with me. Please. Delia, dear Delia, let's not wait anymore. No, Mario. No, not now. Not yet. You said it. When they aren't spying on us anymore. When they are really dead. All of them. All of them? What do you mean "all"? What's the matter with you two? With us, nothing, but with you... Please, stop going over and over the same thing. Nothing is the matter with me, Mom. What are you afraid of? That house. But what's so strange about that house? Sure, from the outside nothing... How long are you going to believe those awful rumors? Nothing that happens to me has anything to do with Delia. I'm just not feeling well, that's all there is to it. If you only knew her... We aren't at all interested in knowing her. In any case, I'm the one who... You can't understand. Forgive me, you just can't. One day when she accepts me I'll bring her by. You'll see, Mom, she's a good person, she's not capable of all those things that everyone says... What are you doing, Delia? Making a gift for Mario. Candy? No, Dad. Vicente, come here for a second. Delia... How long are you are going to keep playing around? Cowards! What's your game, Delia? Why won't you talk to me? Delia, what's the matter? I'm tired, Mario. Really. - But... - No, don't protest. If I could only be born again. Live in another city. Even just another neighborhood. This neighborhood suffocates me. Listen to me just one time. Both of us could be born again... Cowards. Now you skulk in the corners and are too afraid to do anything. Delia... Why didn't you hide in the corners before? Delia! Everything is born again, but only for a while. Then everything becomes disgusting, like always. And everything seems clear... on the outside. Why do you say that? What... what do you mean by that? Because things went badly for you with those boys? Because you receive anonymous letters and you don't understand why the neighbors make faces at you? I'm afraid. If you loved me like I love you. You have to be mine first to end this disgusting thing. Delia... Delia, please, don't go like that. Delia... Murderer! They're making our lives impossible with these anonymous letters. I'm beginning to be afraid. It's like an oil stain that keeps getting bigger and bigger. We have to talk with her. Is she here? Where is she? Here, Father. The little blue fish died, you know. That's why you... We need to talk, Delia. I don't know what you plan to do because that boy really loves you, and you... That's over with. It's time you understood. We're worried. What can I tell you? There are things that... Of course, I marry him end leave here and you two... Everything is so easy, isn't it? You've played around enough, Delia. You're disgusting... Don't start with the name calling! Cowards, now you skulk in the corners and are too afraid to do anything. Why weren't you skulking in the corners before? Delia, don't make us lose our patience. So what? Isn't it fair? You talk about fairness? If you were just a bit fairer, just a bit... Go... get out, I said! Mario is coming today. I don't want us to speak about this again. I told him we will get married next month. Tonight he's bringing... the rings. We'll get married and that's it! It doesn't matter that I didn't have you first! You don't know how I love you. Tonight we'll tell your parents. Yes... who is calling? Raquel? One moment. Mario, Raquel is calling. I just told them that you were coming. For me it's okay to wait a bit, but things have gotten complicated. What's the matter, Delia? What's the truth? It's not easy to understand. Why bother to explain it? What do you want me to bring? Flowers? If we are getting engaged I want to get you something. No. Don't bring anything. Leave it to me. What do you mean nothing, Delia? I have to. What are they going to say in your house? Dad, don't you hear me? Go. Can I borrow your gray tie, Dad? All of your wishes for me will be met, even if you don't believe it. You'll see... Delia, aren't you going to open the door? Do you want me to open it? Are you there, Delia? Are you going to open up or are you deaf? No, Mom, I'm not deaf. I was waiting for the candies to cool off. It's a lot like the night that Rolo came over, and Hector, too. Delia, please. How much longer? How much longer? But it's always the same time, Mom. So then what? Leave me alone. Did you turn all the lights on? Did you? You'll have to come for dinner sometime... What do you think? When San Lorenzo wins the championship we'll celebrate here. Do you like soccer? Do you think San Lorenzo can win? Let's go, it's already late. Sorry, I didn't notice the time. Don't leave. You are such a sleepyhead... It isn't even eleven. We finally start a conversation, and you insist on going to sleep early. Let's go. She hates San Lorenzo. That's why she wants me to go to sleep early. It's not early, it's late. Let's go. Forgive him, he doesn't usually drink and... There's nothing to forgive. He's very nice... Mario, what's the matter? Actually, it's the first time that... but, today everything is so different. Yes. There's too much light. Unless you are also tired and want to go. Delia, please. No, Mario, don't. Let's go somewhere else. I know... Delia. Mario. It's not that, Mario. I don't care about them. So then what, Delia? Leave me alone... I love you, Delia... I love you... I love you, too. So, what are we waiting for? Waiting... Soon you'll be mine, Delia. Delia. It will be so beautiful, Delia. Just one minute, Mario. Stay here. I'll be right back. Delia. Wait. Murderer! "It's one thing for one boyfriend to die on a girl, but two?" "One on her doorstop and the other jumping into the river." Anyone would say you think she killed them. There are many ways to kill someone. Keep talking until you knock yourselves out. She and I really don't care. Delia, what kind of candy is this? What is this made of? What kind of candy is this? Yes? Oh, yes, Raquel. Yes, I'm sorry, I wasn't home... yes, of course, yes... THE END
