'Right over this way, sir.' 'Right this way. You can't afford to miss him.' He lives. He breathes. He's as rigid as a totem pole. Yes, siree, folks. He is absolutely petrified. Stiff! Stiff as the mummy of an Egyptian potentate. 'And all we ask is one tenth part of a dollar.' One ten dime to scrutinize this thrilling freak of nature. 'She will amaze you. She will astound you.' 'Marva, the headless woman.' Why, she baffles all the medical doctors. Marva, the headless beauty from continental Europe. 'Kept alive by a famous surgeon's secret.' - Here you are, sir. - Two please. Two, sir? My good man, if he goes in, I go in too. Oh. The two of you. Come along, my friend. And now, You see before your very eyes... Marva. The first woman in history to lose her head and never know the difference. Well, can you imagine? Doctors are sure clever nowadays. My. My. Your attention is now directed, ladies and gentlemen to this machine. 'By means of a secret process' 'chemical blood is manufactured here' and pumped through these coils to the great jugular artery. Thus, keeping Marva physically fit and in radiant health. You can see for yourself, her abounding vitality. 'Now, you may ask, what would she say if she could speak?' What strange secrets of her headless world would she impart? But she cannot speak. Marva cannot speak or hear or see. 'To the end of her days' Marva will be held in her prison of silence. Ladies and gen.. Oh! What's the idea? - Somethin' was crawlin' on me. - You dumb dame! Ladies and gentlemen, please. I see you have detected our harmless little deception but I beg of you, don't be unreasonable. Your money will be cheerfully refunded by our cashier now, please file out. Well, I'll tell a Judge about this. Oh, it was you, wise guy. I've to knock your ears off for this. I couldn't help it. It's that fish guy in the monkey suit. 'Let me get my hands on him.' Oh-h! The best yap act in the outfit. Two bits are taken. Turning 'em away. Aw, gee, boss. I'm awful sorry. Get your stuff and get outta here. Go on. Get out. Oh! Merry Christmas. # Jingle bells jingle bells Jingle all the day # # Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse... # Hey, you. Well, if it isn't the headless beauty. It isn't anymore, fancy pants. Thanks to you and your sense of humor. That joke cost me my job. My child, those who scoff at science are destined to fail. Oh, yeah? Climb down, boys. Let me at him. Aww. Weep for poor Donald. He shall not look upon his like again. Boiled as an owl, I might've known. Only a drunk would pull the kind of a trick you did. Don't worry, boys. A poke in the butt wouldn't do him any good. He needs a double breasted straight jacket. No, no. Come on now. Let's make up and let bygones be bygones. Maybe life's a jolly fourth of July picnic to you, brother but it certainly isn't to me. You cancelled my meal ticket, it's the middle of the night there aren't trains or buses till morning I got two dimes and 45 miles between me and New York. Well, what are you gonna do about it? I'll take you. How? Piggyback? No, no, no, no. In my car. We'll have a little drink here with Curley and shove off. - What do you say? - In a word, no. Don't need to see the newspaper picture of the accident to know how I'd look sprinkled all over the highway. Well, what's the next idea? I know. You take my car. Is that offer on the level? Why? Certainly. Here. Here, there's your ticket. And there's the bus. Waiting right over there at the terminal. Ooh, is that a break for you, girlie? What do I do with it after I reach the city? Just drive to the Waldorf Garage. The Waldorf Astoria? Bet you can't say that thrice fast without a mistake. Look, I've had enough of you. Gotta watch my blood pressure. - So long. - Oh, now wait a minute. Kiss me goodbye, my sweet for we'll never see each other again. Oh, yes, we will, honey. I've got a bad habit of looking at the dummies in store windows. Ha ha ha. Evening officer. Kinda new to this neighborhood, aren't you? Brand new. It's my first visit and I'm on my way out. You're from Brooklyn, aren't you? You picked it. South Brooklyn. Friend of the Rawlstons? Rawlston? Never heard of them. What street do they live on? Pull over. Look, officer, I'm in kind of a hurry. If you're lonesome and wanna talk couldn't we ride like this? Pull over. Well, okay. Let me see your driver's license. Say, what's the idea? I was only doing 25. Hand over the driver's license. - Well, I would if I had one. - Then an Owner's Certificate? Look, officer, what've I done? You started off kinda friendly. You got something against people from South Brooklyn? Where did you get this car? I borrowed it. Is that a crime? Oh, so you borrowed it. Who from? From the fellow who owns it. Or at least he said it was his. What's his name? Well, I don't know. We weren't formally introduced. What's your name, sister? I go by Maisie Ravier. But my right name is Mary Anastasia O'Connor. Oh, an alias. Car thieves are getting better looking every day. And you didn't pick yourself a cheap one either. 'But one that cost plenty of dough.' 'One of the Rawlston's cars.' 'That's where you made your mistake.' Every cop on the pipe from here to Montauk Point knows the Rawlstons cars. Come along with me. Look, officer, You got this all wrong. Let me explain how it happened... Tell it to the Judge in the morning. Now, come on. Am I to understand I'm under arrest? Yes. There was a pinhead that worked at the carnival with me. Funny, he never said anything about having a son on the police force. But I guess he had his pride, same as anybody else. It seems to me I deserve some consideration around here on accounts of my Uncle Denny. A good cop with a wonderful record. He never made any false arrests. Oh, this is an all time low. What kind of stars could've been over Brooklyn when I was born? According to the car's owner he has no recollection of lending the vehicle. Well, according to me, I don't care what he says. Remain silent until the court questions you. Is this a free country where a girl's got rights to ask questions? Or has everything taken a turn for the worse since last night? 'This is a free country.' Then I'd like to know, between me standing here and telling you I never stole so much as a hairpin in my life and the guy's busy nursing a hangover he don't know whether it's Thursday or raining. Whose words are you gonna take? Mine or his? Mr. Rawlston, however, stated he did not care to bring charges. Well, I call that big of Mr. Rawlston. As to these charges, driving without a license resisting an officer, using abusive language and vagrancy. Oh, who's using abusive language now? There's limits to what a girl can take. That's not fair. Isn't it true that you're without funds an address or definite employment? Listen, Judge, I had a job at the Marlo Brothers Carnival. It was to last for two months at $25 a week. I lost that job through no fault of mine. If you make me pay more than I've already paid for what was Rawlston's fault, every bit of it you won't be handin' out justice. I'm not afraid to face the music for anything I did wrong. Maybe I made a mistake when I called him an ape. And maybe I didn't. I beg your pardon. Judge Thatcher, when they first questioned me about the car things were, well, frankly, quite hazy in my mind. In fact, I remembered almost nothing of last night. But since listening to Miss, uh.. - Ravier. - Thank you. ...to Miss Ravier and all the evidence I can remember enough to feel sure that what she says is probably true. I'm terribly sorry if I was responsible and I hope you'll accept my apologies. Hmph! Apologies? You'll have to do better than that. It's high time that you realize that your adolescent behavior 'is a source of annoyance to every self-respecting citizen' 'in this community.' This last escapade has had very serious consequences. You're not on trial here, but I hold you directly responsible for this young woman's predicament. 'Therefore..' ...this court orders that you attempt to make amends by reimbursing her immediately with a sum she would've earned in gainful employment. Oh no, not me. Thanks all the same, but I don't take money from anybody, unless I earn it. Very well, then you will employ Miss Ravier at $25 a week for two months in a job that's congenial to her. Oh, but, Judge Thatcher, you know I haven't any employment to offer. I haven't any business. You will make it your business to give her employment is the court orders. All charges dismissed. Case closed. Oh, gee, Judge, you turned out to be human after all. 'Thanks a million.' Not at all. If he doesn't supply that job, you just let me know. Okay, Judgie. Oh, here, allow me. Well, thanks. The Judge didn't say you had to wait on me. I, uh.. Oh, that's alright, I'll just climb over it. - Well, where we going? - I'm taking you home. Maybe this whole thing wasn't such a hot idea. - He said you'd give me a job. - I know and I'm going to. You heard me tell Judge Thatcher that I wasn't in business of any kind. So, the only thing I can do is find something at the house. What for instance? Well, to be perfectly frank with you, I don't know. But don't worry, we'll work something out. Well, if you really mean that, tell me what ideas you got and I'll tell you how they hit me. Well... we have quite a few books. Oh, come on, now. Do I look like a librarian? Maybe you're right. Look, uh, you and your folks eat home, don't you? Yes? Couldn't you use someone to put it on the table and wash up? I'd be okay at that. I'm clean and I'm quick. Of course, if you don't mind doing some kind of housework I... I just didn't like to suggest it. If you ask me, it's good as being a headless woman any day. Okay, mister, you got a new maid. Fine, I'll turn you over to Walpole at home. Walpole? Why, Walpole was sort of taking care of things for us since... before I was born. Will I be staying on the place or do I get a room somewhere? Well, I, uh, think you better stay at the house. We're quite away from the village. Okay, I'm not fussy as long as you got a spare room I can hang my hat. Cigarette? Thanks! Let's have some music, shall we? Yeah, lets. 'Light?' Thanks. Gee, I can't believe it. Believe what? The change in you since last night. Are you really this nice or are you afraid of the Judge? Well, I'm not afraid of the Judge. Say, what were you celebrating last night? Christmas eve. Uh-oh. When you start playing Santa Clause at the end of June you're in a bad way. Hmm. I guess you are, at that. Here we are. Say, you're sure lucky living so close to a park. It's not a park. - This is part of the grounds. - Grounds? Gee. There's the house, over there. Say, it certainly is a picture. And here I was worrying if you'd have enough room. Why, it's the size of a hotel. As a matter of fact, that about describes it. Allow me, Mr. Robert. Good morning.. Al Walpole, this is Miss Ravier. Oh, you're him. Well I'm glad to meet you, Walpole. How do you do, Miss.. Uh, Ravier, but you can just call me Maisie. Frankly, I'd feel more at home if you both did. What do you call yourself? Bob? Sure, that's right. Oh, Walpole, Miss, uh, that is Maisie is stopping with us for two months. Yes, Mr. Robert. At a salary of $25 a week. Y-yes, Mr. Robert. Maybe you better tell him I'm the new maid. - Oh, that's right. - M-maid? Yes and find something decent for her. No, no scrubbing floors nothing like that. No, sir, I-I'll do my best. Oh, anything you got open will do fine. I played a maid in a show, I know how to act. 'Even if the routine will be kinda new.' You're a theatrical personage, Maisie. I was the cause of her losing her job with the carnival. Although, this isn't much of a substitute... Oh, will you quit. I told you, being the headless woman is no bed of roses. That's right you did. Oh, there's her bag, Walpole. Yes, sir. I-I-I'll get it. Walpole will handle everything so I'll leave you with him. - Now, if you'll excuse me... - Sure, Bob. Go ahead. - I'll see you around later. - That's right. - Follow me, miss. - Oh, you bet. Come along. Say, the lobby of Radio City's got nothing on this. And he calls this a house. Does Bob live here all alone? Oh, Miss. Maisie, not Bob. Oh, you mean he's married. Mercy me no, Mr. Robert lives here with his father and Miss Abigail, his sister. Oh, where's his mother? Isn't she... Mrs. Rawlston is no longer living. Oh. Gee, she must've kinda hated to leave all these beautiful things. She was a very great lady, her presence is badly missed. Only three people and all this space. How do they find their way around? Drop pebbles? Reporting for duty. How do I look in the outfit, Walpole? Say, you look kinda pale, is anything the matter? Everything. Those earrings and all that jewelry. They're just not worn when one's in uniform. Well, if that's the case I'll peel 'em off but I must say, I'm gonna look kinda undressed. And your shoes. 'Your toes, your toes are protruding.' Good gracious! Haven't you a more conservative pair? Well, If you mean have I got any ground grippers? No. These or my wedges and they got the toes in and the heels out. - Wedges? - Uh-huh. None of those by all means. Oh, please don't misinterpret my criticism. But we must, you must be most discrete, now of all the times. Why now? Is anything goin' on? A great deal. We have a house full of guests. Oh, I didn't see any company. No, they're being served breakfast by the swimming pool. We have a lot more guests coming tomorrow for the engagement dinner. Oh. Bob's engaged? Mr. Robert. No, It's not Mr. Robert, it's Miss Abigail whose engagement will be announced. Oh, that's nice. Excuse me. Ah, yes. That's Miss Abigail summoning me, I must go. What about me? I'm supposed to be working here. Oh, yes-yes, well, take that bowl of flowers upstairs put it on the console table in the west corridor of the south wing. Got a map? Yes. Well, use the back stairs. Are you quite sure you understand? Don't you worry your cute little head about me. She said cute. Come in. - Good morning, Miss Abby. - Good morning, Walpole. Isn't this the most beautiful day? Indeed it is, Miss Abby. Walpole, I rang for you because I was wondering I haven't heard from father and I thought perhaps there might be a telegram that was overlooked in all the excitement? No, no telegram has come, Miss Abby. But I feel certain he'll be coming after all, a dinner party for the announcement of his daughter's engagement. It's an important occasion. Oh, be sure of it, he'll be here tomorrow night. Oh, it's silly of me to worry, isn't it? Oh, no special request today, Walpole. See that our guests are well taken care of and tell cook to give us something very nice for dinner. But you always do that anyway. Thank you, Miss Abby. Walpole, are you sure the decorators are coming today? Mr. Wichely assured me he'd be here at 11 to arrange the table. Oh, wonderful! Have you seen Mr. Phillips yet? Mr. Phillips breakfasted in his room. He wished to wait till you were ready before going down to the pool. Oh, I didn't know he was waiting for me. Thank you, Walpole. Oh, uh, say, mister, could you tell me which is the camisole table? The camisole table? Well, now, I'll tell you the console table is right there. Thanks. Don't know your way around, do you, Peggy? I know my way all around and the name isn't Peggy... Charlie. The name is not Charlie. It's Phillips, Link Phillips. Wait a minute. What are you made up for? You're no maid. What's this? A rib of some kind? One of the gangs staging a practical joke. Yeah, County Judge down at Bell Harbor he's very comical, keep you in stitches. A Judge? I don't get it. Pardon my frankness, but I don't care whether you get it or not. Just as cute as you're fresh, aren't you? You know, we had a saying on our block once "I'd rather be fresh than stale." We girls used to say it to dirty little boys. It's a corny old crack, but it's still good enough. - Well, I'll be.. - 'Link, oh, Link?' Coming, darling. We'll spar a couple of more rounds later. Link, it was sweet of you to wait for me. I never mind waiting... if it's for you. Well, "Everybody to his taste" said the old lady as she kissed the cow. Oh, pardon the thing, answer that somebody. Hello? Please bring a dozen more of the breakfast plates to the pool. The breakfast plates? The blue and white ones, second shelf by the window, hurry up. Okay, coming right up. - Your breakfast, miss. - Oh, thank you. - Good morning, Miss Abby. - Good morning. Oh, Abby darling, bless you. - Good morning, all. - Good morning, everybody. Have you everything you want, everyone? Now, that you're here, everything, honey child. Abby, my pet, you are such a divine hostess. You're spoiling us hopelessly. Really, I'm already dreading the day I have to leave. Speaking as the oldest guest in this charming resort, so am I. Why, John. Don't be so naive. What's your bid? Oh, good morning, Bob. I didn't see you. Oh, I'm trying my best to be inconspicuous. He is being very mysterious, Abby. Won't tell us a thing about where he disappeared to after dinner last night. Yeah, that's me. Man of mystery. Uh-oh. 'I could've made a Grand Slam with half of what you had.' I'd like to see you bid a Grand Slam. Let's see you make a grand splash. Ooh. Oh. Hello, Bob. Somebody sent for these plates. What do I do with them? Why don't you take them one by one and throw at the guests? Oh, Bob. No, on the level, somebody did... - Come here. - Hey, let go. Say, what is the idea? What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? - When were you engaged? - This morning, do ya mind? Get back in the house. What is it that's so funny? You name it, I can't. - You kidding me. This is a gag. - It's marvelous. - Who's idea was it? - I don't know. Judge Thatcher's. Maisie is my award for two months. Two long happy months. Oh, Bob, what is it this time? Well, it's the stupefying challenge the intellect. The headless woman from the Marlo Brothers Carnival. Oh. Maisie, Maisie. Maisie, you've not yet removed the, those things. I must ask you to take them off at once. You said you would. For two cents I'd take off the whole outfit and sit out the summer in Central Park. How long you've been serving time here, Walpole? Maisie, I must ask you to try to be a little.. Oh, I've been the Rawlston Butler for 30 years. Thirty years on the 17th of April. Thirty years? Boy, have you taken your beating like a man. Say, who are those assorted nuts out at the pool anyway? Maisie, I must rebuke you. These young people are Miss Abby's guests. Her friends. You mustn't speak so disrespectfully of them. Listen, Walpole, I've spent my last 20 years learning how to spot phonies. When the label reads imitation why not say so out loud? - You don't like them, do you? - My dear, show mercy me. I don't know. I need that paycheck bad. I'm thinking it's one of those times when money is too expensive. Yes, Maisie. Ah, very good. You wish to see me, Miss Abby? Ah, yes, I do. Your name is, Maisie, isn't it? That's right... ma'am. This is Miss Rawlston, Miss Abigail. Oh, you are the sister... ma'am. Yes, my brother told me how you happened to be here. - Yes, ma'am. - No. Not ma'am, Miss Abigail. That isn't necessary, Walpole. Bob had to employ you for two months at $25 a week. Right? I had it coming after what he put me through. That was the Judge's idea too. That's the front door bell, will you excuse me, Miss Abby? I think Judge Thatcher was perfectly right. I can't expect you to do this sort of thing. It isn't fair to you or to my guests. So, perhaps we can solve everything by paying you now in advance. You can find something more suitable. Why don't you say you want me outta here? Oh, that's not why... I told your brother it was a job or no dice. That happens to be the way I operate, lady. Strange as it sounds. And when I put on this outfit all I expected was $25 a week and half-way decent treatment in return for doing my best. If that isn't good enough for you, just say so. I'll go. With exactly what I bought here. Two dimes, a suitcase and a talent for picking the jinxes. Oh, please, I only suggested that-the money because I thought you'd be happier with it that way. Uh-huh. I'll bet. You came up here from the pool all worked up about making me happy. You came up here to pay off nature's mistake so your guests wouldn't be embarrassed looking at her. Oh, please don't feel that way. Listen, maybe I don't know the ins and outs of being a maid but that crowd of yours wouldn't be held over for a second week in some spots I've played. If they were rude to you.. - If we were rude, I'm sorry. - Oh, skip it. Looking back on it, I didn't behave so hot myself there or just now to you. But your brother lost me a job yesterday. Today he's very swell and very sorry I thought the job would be okay. Now it's curdle on me, you can't blame me for being burned up. No, Maisie. I don't blame you a bit. I'd be burned up myself. But don't go. I know how you feel about not wanting to take the money without working for it, really I do. Yeah, well, maybe you do at that. But in eight weeks I'd be a cinch to tangle with those comics down by the pool sure as fate. They give me that.. "Well, darling, she is too, too laughable, I mean really." And I'd give them a right cross. Oh, Maisie, I'm sure that won't happen again. Here is an idea. Nora has been taking care of me, she's my personal maid. But she is very busy with the house so full. Would you try that job? Well, being your personal dresser you mean? Yes. I'm sure you'd find it pleasant. I might give it a trial. If I do anything outta line you call me on it I'll do it right the next time. - I know you will. - Okay, Miss Abigail, deal. Maisie, I'm veryhappy. Tell me, I want to rejoice too. Oh, Link dear, I want you to meet Maisie. She's going to be my personal dresser. This is Mr. Phillips my fiance, Maisie. It's a pleasure, Maisie. How do you do? Miss Abby, the decorators have arrived. - Where are they, Walpole? - In the dining room. Come on, it's about the decorations for tomorrow night and I want your advice. So, your name's Maisie. Now, why didn't I guess it? I wouldn't know. But I had you tagged the minute I saw you. Yeah, the missing link. What do you say we all go to bed? - That's a good idea. - Aw, not so early. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Let's make a night of it. Why go to bed so early? No back talk. Tomorrow's the big night. Up you go. Alright. But today is already tomorrow. - Oh, come on, Georgie-porgie. - It's a woman's world. What's happened to Bob tonight? I haven't seen him around. Maybe he's on the trail of another headless woman. - Well, goodnight now. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Walpole. - Goodnight, Miss Abby. - Goodnight, Louis. - 'Goodnight, Miss Abby.' - Goodnight. - Goodnight, sir. Tired, my pet. No, I'm so excited, I don't feel sleepy. If I do go to sleep, maybe it'll be morning sooner. That's right. Oh, Link, do you really think father will come? I'm beginning to feel a bit jealous of Cap. After all he's your pop but I don't want anyone on your mind, but me.' 'In fact, I protest my girl.' 'You are my girl, aren't you, Miss Rawlston?' 'Oh, Link, forever.' Goodnight, darling. Sleep well. Goodnight, dearest. Oh, Maisie, I didn't except you to wait up for me. Oh, it's okay. It's part of the job. I've made up my mind not to miss a cue. That's very sweet of you. Only just call me Miss Abby, will you? Sure, Miss Abby. I've hated the sound of my name. - Ever since my boarding school. - Yeah? The girls used to have a rhyme they'd tease me with. "Pigtail Abigail got no sense, but lots of kale." Can you imagine a silly rhyme like that making me hate my name? I remember one the South Brooklyn punks used to pull on me when I was a kid. "Big slat, brickbat Mary O'Conner is a polecat." That's my real name, Mary Anastasia O'Connor after my mother's favorite sister. I see. Did the rhyme hurt your feelings, Maisie? Ho ho, not mine. I was a pretty good amateur rock thrower in those days. I had to be. 'Speaking of rocks.' Don't tell me that's all the real stuff. Why, yes. Gee, I've never been this close to genuine rocks in my whole life. - Is it alright to look? - Of course, Maisie. Diamonds, emeralds. Look at that ruby broach. See you should've worn that and those bracelets tonight. Sure would have dressed up that outfit. Well, I don't usually wear any jewelry, Maisie. Only this little pin that belonged to my mother. I don't care much for the other. Except of course, my engagement ring. You don't? Pardon the personal questions. Why'd you buy it if you don't like it? I didn't buy any of it. - They are presents from father. - Oh! You see he's had to be away so much. He's always sorry when he isn't here for special occasions. If it is your birthday or something he can't make it, he sends you those? That's right. Boy, I'd certainly have a lot of birthdays and special occasions. From the looks of it, he must have missed a lot of them. What does he do? He can't be a salesman. 'Oh-oh no.' What kind of business is he in that keeps him on the go? 'He isn't in any business, Maisie.' Father is very popular. He plays a wonderful game of golf. He loves to hunt and sail. Oh, Cap leads a very exciting, busy life. Yeah, it sounds busy. Would you like to take another bath? I'll just splash some cold water on my face and hop in to bed. Goodnight and thanks for waiting up for me. Goodnight, Miss Abby. See you in the A.M. 'You know something? I have been reviewing our talks together.' 'Yes. I have been running over a long series of fireside chats.' It's finally been born in on me that you never say anything. Might as well be talking to myself. That goes for you too, General. Now, look here sir. This face was given to me and if you don't like it, I'm sorry. But from him. Might as well face it boys, he is a bust. But you definitely disappoint me. Oh, well. I shall have a drink. This one, flint-heart is on you. Oh! What's that? Mice? Oh. Bob, it's you. Well, with all the people I could have met. The only one I wanted to meet. I met. Well, well, what are you celebrating tonight? Groundhog Day? Oh, no, no, no. Christmas eve. I'm loyal to Christmas eve. One good Christmas eve deserves another. Say, it isn't always Christmas eve with you, is it? - Oh, no, no. - Good. Just almost always. Oh, Maisie, would you forgive my presuming on our brief acquaintance? Well I don't know. That depends on what one's presuming around here. Well, I would like to say something. I would really. I'd like to venture the remark that you strike me like as an ideal companion for a Christmas eve. That is my recent conclusion and I stand by it. Yes, a good company that would be you. Fun. Hmm, gee, thanks. I wish you'd said that sober, pal. But thanks all the same. And let me take it just a step further. You would also be a charming companion at a roller derby. A Midget Auto Race, Flower Show, Varnishing Day or a Michaelmas. And it would cause no end consternation. Oh, limousines would rear and lunette would crash to the floor. You would grace my aunt in the diamond horse shoe at the opening at the opera. They would say, "Bob, how dare you?" And I will say, "this is my lady." Boy, oh boy, oh boy wouldn't we have fun. I get it. That man's here again. In the words of, George and old Gordon Lord Byron "There'd be none of Beauty's daughters with a magic like thee." In the words of Maisie Lady Ravier, "get yourself a new stooge." I'm going to bed. Oh, no, no, please no the night is young. Though we might stick on here. Oh, come on, Maisie. Now, sit down and chat with me. Maybe I better then. Maybe I better sit down and take a good long look. Once I really memorize somethin', I don't forget it. That's what I want to hear. I've listed your good qualities. What do you like about me? Well. There was a guy who spoke up in court once when he didn't have too. I liked him fine. And when that guy made a mistake and hurt somebody. He was man enough to own up to it. 'I liked that fine too.' Certainly. And he was so polite. Treated me like a lady. You set a lot of store by nice man as when you've been over the bumps like I have. Simple case of Noblesse oblige. Yeah. Looking back on it he was a great guy. But brother, that wasn't you. Lady Vier deRavier, I am one and the same. Your stratosphere prince, Flash Gordon. I don't know, maybe, I'm losing my grip. Out of my way, funny man, I'm going. Take my advice, travel by air. It's the modern way. Safe, quick and quick. Thanks, all the same. But I just found out, I can take a nose dive standing right here on the ground. Let me reassure you, this plane is absolutely bulletproof. Here, wait, wait. Let me show you. See, it can climb 600ft in forty. Why can't you see me settle down. Here she comes with a roar from space all set for a three point landing on a dime. - 'Woo-ho!' - Look out. Oh. I guess, I must have forgot to retract the landing gear. 'I'm dreadfully sorry. Hold me tight.' 'Oh, get away from me, you!' Maisie. Bob? Go away, wrestling match is no place for a woman. - It's too brutal. - Oh, Bob! - Maisie, I-I'm sorry. - It wasn't your fault. Haven't you caused her enough trouble and unhappiness already? Of course, I'm trying to assume. Make her happier or happy are reasonable facts are simply there. So why not her's. The democratic way. Santa Claus? Cap. It might be Cap. Come on. Hurry up! Cap. Hey, Cap. Is that you, Cap? - Abby, darling! - Oh, Diana. Of all people! The plot thickens. Isn't it foul, my barging in like this? Oh, no, it's a wonderful surprise. - Quite a surprise. - Bobby, dear. Pardon, my claws, how are yours? Same old adorable, Bobby. 'On my bill, please.' 'Yes, Ms. Rawlston.' Weren't you in San Francisco? Darling, I was until I read about your engagement. My dear! It's in the newspapers already? Of course. Isn't it the most exciting news? How did you take it? Standing up or sitting down? Silly, I was thrilled speechless. I had to be here for your announcement dinner. 'Oh, I'm very happy.' What a shame, everyone's in bed. - I'll wake 'em up. - Oh, no, no, please. I'm much too exhausted from my plane to see anyone. Not even Link? Oh, Walpole. - How nice to see you. - Thank you, Miss Diana. - The Venetian? - Heavenly. You're sure I'm not... If isn't always your favorite room waiting for you. Walpole, Mr. Bob will take that case. You and Maisie go to bed. - Very good, Ms. Abby? - What's good about it? - Traveling kind of light. - Come along, let's go upstairs. 'I just dropped everything late' 'and rushed to the airport.' 'Di, if I had only known..' Goodnight, Maisie. Merry Christmas. Walpole, one for you too. Well, that's the end of the day, I hope. Yes, I think it's safe to retire now. What a place! Boarders drop in at any odd time. If you ask me that one seemed anxious to get here. Yeah? I fear, Mr. Robert was not quite himself, this evening. Yes, he was. It was this morning he wasn't quite himself. Well, him being nice and sober make him sense as a character apart. That's the real Rawlston that speech makin' drunk. Oh, Maisie, no. Oh, Walpole, yes! Mr. Robert has a fine scientific mind. Preserved in alcohol. Are you sure? You're quite wrong. You want to see my scar? I've known him since his birth. Oh, yeah, I know. But then all babies are cute. Oh, dear, dear. Yes, I, I realize it's quite late but won't you step into my sitting room just for a moment? Oh, Walpole. Not you too. I beg your pardon? I beg yours. A day here is done, thanks to me. I've kept a scrapbook of Mr. Robert's activities. He showed fine promise. Believe me, you're misjudging him. Now, won't you step in, just for a moment and see for yourself. - Well, okay. - Yeah. Mr. Robert in 1920. So he was on the wagon only 20 years ago. Excuse me. Ah! 'Here, he is, with his first cup.' He should have bought a man size stein to begin on. No, no, that's a trophy! He won that in competition with 5000 boys of his age. Doing what? Cutting out paper doll? No, no. Building the best model airplane in the country. Maisie, he won that trophy for five straight years. No. In 1930, he went to the Massachusetts Institute of technology. One of the finest scientific schools in the country. And there he had a brilliant record. Would've been one of the leading airplane designers in America. Had he remained to graduate. I guess, he just didn't have time. Too busy leaping from jag to jag. As a junior, he won the McBride scholarship. Very great honor, I assure you. It was then, that he left. He came home at Christmas.. ...and never returned to college. Christmas? Yes, I was opening the Florida house. Mr. Rawlston was visiting friends in Rio. 'Ms. Abby was at school.' 'In Switzerland.' And Master Robert was all alone. He got lit up like a Christmas tree and has stayed that way ever since. How did the chair shake? - Nighty-night, Walpole. - Nighty.. Uh, oh! Goodnight, Maisie. Thanks for showing it to me. Knowing him when he was little must make looking at him today even tougher. Everything he was, he is. You'll realize that Maisie if you knew him as well as I do. Oh, yeah, I couldn't be fonder of him if he were my own son. Well, if you ask me. It's too bad, you couldn't have been his father. He's just going through a phase. That's all. - Just a phase. - Yup. The phase in the bar room floor. Well, what have we here? Hello darling, how are you this morning? - Oh, you, sweet thing? - Orange juice? Yes, rather. That's a start. How about a little tennis after you gorged yourself, Mr. Phillips? Oh, brilliant idea from one so young? Well. Anything I can do for you, Maisie? You can tell me where's Ms. Abby. Oh, anyone seen Abby? 'She dashed out a few minutes ago to her room.' - There you are. - Thanks. Hello, everybody. Well, isn't anybody going to say hello? Well, well, well. Hello, Link. Hello yourself, beautiful. What a good morning surprise. And what about your surprise, you rogue? 'Aren't you the one?' I'm thrilled, I can hardly speak. Yes, thanks. Have you seen Abby? Isn't he cute? Acting like a husband already. Come on, sit down. Tell me all about it. Just think five short weeks since I went to the coast. But so much has happened. - May I get you breakfast? - Just a little, thanks. I'm much too excited to eat. Sit down and have your breakfast, Link... darling. Because afterwards I'm gonna snatch you right from under Abby's nose. 'For a good old gab' This is so divine, children. I'm sorry. I promised to play polo with the Sedricks, today. I can't let them down. Terribly sorry. I've to go like mad to make it. Excuse me. Oh, polo. I'll ride over with you. I should be gone most of the day, terribly sorry to rush off. See you, later. Well, so long, everybody. Dear, Link. He always have such a time remembering his social engagements. Mr. Rawlston left when? Last night? Then he's probably on his way here. No, no message. This is his daughter. Thank you. - Yes, Maisie? - A package for you, Ms. Abby. Thank you. Cartiers. Here, I'll open it. 'Holy smoke.' 'Boy!' From your dad? Isn't he gonna be here, tonight, Ms. Abby? No. Gee, I'm sure sorry. Link. Oh, Link. Abby, my dear, what is it? Cap. Oh. - He isn't gonna be here? - No. Too bad. You leave us alone, please. Seems to me more than the silver could stand a little cleanin' up around here. I don't think I quite understand. Well, that makes two of us. Talk about your jigsaw puzzle. Are you fond of puzzles too? I'm rather an expert if I may say so. Well, maybe you can explain this one. How does that Diana fit into the picture? Ms. Diana? - What picture? - No, no, never mind. But take a stab at this one. What kind a half baked father is it that won't come home for his daughter's engagement dinner? - Isn't Ms. Rawlston coming? - No. He sent a million dollars worth of cracked ice instead. - Cracked ice? - Yeah, you know, jewelry. Maisie, you must not. Well, I feel sure that he bent every effort to get here. Yeah, well, somebody ought to bend him around around his neck. Oh, what's the difference. I should worry. Now, I'm gonna catch up on a cup of coffee. The buzzer, Maisie. That's Ms. Abby. - The backstairs please, Maisie. - The backstairs please, Maisie. Okay, cutie pie. Oh, Maisie. Gee, what happened? A couple of minutes ago you were in tears. I know. Now, I'm the happiest girl alive. You must help me so I must tell you. Promise me, you won't tell a soul. Are you going away some place? To be married. We're eloping. Oh. You and Mr. Phillips are gonna get married today? I can hardly believe it, myself but it's true. - But Ms. Abby... - Isn't it romantic? It was all Mr. Link's idea. Everyone will be here, tonight, to celebrate our engagement. And we'll send 'em a telegram telling them to celebrate our wedding. - We'll be on our honeymoon! - Oh, but you think you should? I mean, isn't it all of a sudden? Too sudden? That's what's so romantic about it. Now, listen carefully, Maisie. Here's the key to the DeSoto. Get it out. Park it and leave the motor running. If anybody asks, make some excuse. When no one's around come back here and call us. We'll be ready in a few minutes. If I'm not here, I'll be in his room, packing. - Will you do that? - Sure, Ms. Abby. I only wish it could be more. Thank you, Maisie. Now, hurry and remember not to tell anyone. I wish I wasn't always getting hunches. Hunches, Maisie? About what? Nothing. Rather dressy for polo, aren't you? Yes, if I were playing polo but I had an unexpected call and have to run into the city. How important. The very day you're engagement's to be announced. With a fanfare of gold plated trumpets. Alright, Diana. - Let's get down the cases. - Let's. I had every intention of seeing you and talking things over when you got back from the coast. But I didn't expect what happened this morning. Your remarks and the way you looked at me. - 'Wasn't like you at all.' - Really? Were your delicate sensibilities revolted? Diana, be fair. I tried to be. I wrote and told you all about it. 'I felt sure you'd see it my way.' 'You never answered my letter.' I couldn't hope to compete in writing with that masterpiece of simple direct English prose. So, I'm replying in person, Mr. Phillips. Look, Di. Maybe, I took too much for granted. I guess, I felt too sure about how you'd feel. Why should my marriage to have be spoil anything between you and me? Hurt me? It would be easy if it were only that. You couldn't hurt me, Mr. Phillips. Now, that I see you as you really are. 'You've made me sick with shame and disgust' 'for the fool I have been' I can't even look in a mirror without getting nauseated. If I lived 10 centuries, I'll never get over loathing myself for having spent one moment with you. Well, that's the way you feel. I guess, that's it. But I'm sorry, it had to end this way. Oh, no. This isn't the end. But don't you wish it were. What do you think you can do? Oh, several things. One in particular. Telling Abby a few of the sordid details. And it just occurs to me it might save her some scars. 'Not that my motto's are altruistic' 'A good deed might help restore some of my self respect.' Careful, Missy. Don't get too brave. It may explode in your face. Take your filthy hands off me. Di! Link! What is it? Nothing, Abby. Come on, let's get out of here. Oh, Link, but you and Di were arguing. - What's the trouble? - So, that's it! You're eloping. What a miserable excuse for a human being you are... Diana, how dare you speak to Link like that? Come on, Link. Answer that one, protect yourself. Don't forget the trip I made to the coast. Five horrible weeks, sweating Uncle Alex consent to my marrying you, got cutting of my allowance. Marrying Link? 'That insignificant allowance that kept us both for months' and the things our various hostesses didn't provide. You gonna stand and listen to this rot? No, I'm not, Diana, I don't know why you're saying such horrible things. - But I'm not interested. - That's right, Abby. You're running true to form. You always were as pathetically dumb as they come. Say what you've to say about me leave Abby out. Bravo! For the love of heaven and you're own sake. Wake up! Stop being deaf and blind! 'All your so called friends laughs at your stupidity.' You're buying something that will make you hate yourself. 'You realize if it weren't for your money 'he'll be laughing at you, take it from me, Abby.' 'I know.' Mr. Phillips has just jolted me for the rots of millions. Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear anymore, they're lies! Yes, I'll admit, I did tell one small lie. I lied when I said I read about your engagement in the paper. I didn't. I read it in a letter. From Link. Here, let me share it with you. "My, darling. I'm engaged to marry Abby Rawlston. "I know, you'll understand the reason. "It's an opportunity that you least of anyone "would want me to refuse. '"Money was the only thing that stood between us' '"and complete happiness.' '"And we are both realists.' "Perhaps, instead of the end... this is only the beginning. Your, Link." But, Abby, that was written before.. Au revoir, worse luck next time. Nice goin', pal. Well, what are you looking at? Nothing. I'm near sighted. I can't see that far down. Well, that's over and done with. Oh, honey, I know what hurts right now like you have been scolded but.. ...honest, you're gonna be glad of it, for rest of your life. Ms. Abby, let's you a little wide of your father huh? Everyone knew. Everyone's been laughing. They've always laughed. Deaf... blind... Oh, don't let any of that stuff throw you. I can see now. I can see... myself. There's never been anyone. Nobody used to like me. I always thought there was something wrong with me because no one liked me. 'At school.' Anyplace. And then when Link.. It all began with Link. All of a sudden everything was so wonderful. Link loved me and I had all the friends in the world. Everything was different. But it wasn't. Link didn't love me. Those people... they were pretending because of the money. Just like him. They've all been pretending, right from the start. And I haven't changed one bit. Pink tail Abigail, got no sense but lots.. Oh, don't honey. You just sit tight.. ...I'll be right back. Hi, Maisie. Sorry for what you did last night? Look, Trip. Your sister's in trouble. Trouble, trouble, Doyle and Drupal. Keep quiet and listen if you're not too far gone. She found out about Phillips. He was after her money. Doesn't love her and never did. - Ah, sure. - Sure? You know, what I'm trying... I know, I know, I know, I knew it all the time. You knew it all the time? For crying out loud, I had a hunch myself but it wasn't up to me to say anything. And you say you knew. You've been here right along. You're her brother! That's right, brother, sister. Oh, if I could only shake some sense into you. She's gone all to pieces, Bob. She looks bad and she acts awful funny, I wish... Oh, never mind, you wouldn't be any help, anyway. Oh, Walpole maybe you can help? I'm going to Mr. Robert's room. When your through, will you come to Ms. Abby's room. I'm kinda worried about her. Worried? Oh, dear, dear, dear. Yes, yes of course. 'Ms. Abby.' Abby! Abby! Oh! Walpole! Walpole, come quick, Abby's taken poison. - Come on. - Oh, my goodness! Poisoned. Oh, my poor little Abby. Take her head. - What happened? - Is it Abby? Get out of here you trash. Get out. Whose their doctor? Dr. Fredericks. Stephen W. Fredericks. Well, get him on the phone. No, no, never mind. Tell me the number. You try to round up her father. - What's the number? - Bell port 610. Bell port 610. Operator, Bell port 610. Oh, you! Hello, Dr. Fredericks. The doctor's gotta come out to the Rawlstons right away. - How is she? - Still unconscious. They're both working over her. Dr. Fredericks and Dr. Bryant. They're giving her oxygen now. Your old man sure is taking long enough to get here. A car just turned in. Must be, Mr. Rawlston. Oh! Walpole. - Hello, Bobby. - Hi, Cap. It's terrible, how is she? Just the same, still unconscious. - In her room? - Yes. Cap. I'm glad you got here. She'll pull through won't she, Steve? I can't let you go in, Cap. I can't go in? - But, I.. - 'I'm sorry.' - Is she that bad? - There's no use lying to you. She's very low. You got to do something, that's all. We're doing everything we possibly can. I got Dr. Bryant. He's the best man in the country. She should respond to the treatment. But if she doesn't. I-I can't understand it. You wait downstairs, Cap. I'll call you if there's any change. They wouldn't let me in. Bobby, why did she do a thing like this? Walpole told you on the telephone. - She and Link broke up... - I know, I know but to try to.. Young Phillip's behaving like that. I don't understand it. Seen him around, ever since he was a kid. Always seemed, alright. Very likeable boy. That Josh Phillips was a class mate of mine. Got a cigarette? When Abby wrote me about this engagement I.. ...I thought it was fine. Thought it was alright. He's a sweet kid, she's not terribly attractive. You know, plain and quiet. I was delighted. Gal ought to get married and someone like Phillips. Look here, Bobby you were here right along. Didn't you see how things were going? I suppose I did in a way, but.. Well, I never thought much of Phillips frankly. Bobby, why didn't you call me up or write me? Or talk to Abby? That's what you should've done, boy. Talked the whole thing out with Abby. I couldn't do that. Link struck me as being a bit of a heel. I don't know why particularly, just something about him. He over did the business of being crazy about Abby. It seemed to me but I had nothing definite to go on and Abby thought he was great. I couldn't just go barging into her and say.. ' "I don't like this guy."' Now, how could I do that. Abby thought the world in all of him. Besides, I might've been wrong, might've worked out fine. Can't go around telling people what they should do. They've to work things out for themselves. Yes, of course. I can see that. Yes, your quite right. I swear to heaven, I never heard anything to beat this. Cap, this is Maisie. She found Abby lying on the floor. Say, what kind of people are you, anyway? That girl's lying upstairs with her throat burnt out with acid. They keep saying, she doesn't respond to treatment. Doesn't respond, my foot. She doesn't want to live. She got mixed up with the heel. Bob knew he was a heel but Bob couldn't knock his block off. No, Bob, couldn't even go bargin' into his sister and say, "I don't like this guy." He didn't know her well enough. She was only his sister. 'He was so busy feeling sorry for himself.' He didn't have time to think about Abby. "People got to work things out for themselves!" And you, you didn't know what Phillips was like. For all of you, he might have been Dracula but his father, was in your class so that makes him okay. And if he's kinda plain. Girls always get married. This guy uses the right fork so fine. Only, doesn't bother you. - Now, look here. - Shut up. I've only started. Sure girls have been crossed up by men before. It's happened to me but I've always bounced back. But why couldn't, Abby roll with it? Cry her eyes out for a while then say, "that's that." Because, he was everything to her. Sun, Moon, stars. The friends she never had. The family, everything. She's been starvin' and freezin' in this Grand Central Station of a house for eighteen years. What are you talking about? I'm talking about a little kid, that never had any love. Her mother's dead. She's got a father to speak of. Oh, the guy named Cap who she sees when every place else is closed. She knows he isn't dead cause he sends her jewelry. Well, it happens she don't like jewelry and don't wear it. But you wouldn't know about that or care either. When Phillips scrammed he left her with nothin'. When your no gem, you got to have a shoulder to cry on. A million bucks hasn't got a shoulder! Oh sure, her brother was here. 'He was here right along. He's drunk mostly.' - Bobby, have you been... - Yeah, he has. And how? But I guess, maybe he was lonesome as same as her. It was Link Phillips for her and the bottle for him. Somethin' hit him six years back when he came home for Christmas with a big prize under his arm and nobody to show it to. Not even, Walpole. What's she talking about? It's the McBrides scholarship, I won in my junior year. Yes... yes I remember something... You remember somethin', huh! Yeah! Him and the second man got stiffed that night. The second man sobered up. Master Robert stayed that way. Honest. I thought I'd seen bad fathers and families that had nothing but grief. Compared to this outfit, they were sitting pretty. In my neighborhood when a man beat his kids he knew he was beating 'em and the next day he was sorry. For my money, givin' 'em the flat of your hand is better than givin' 'em nothing.' And that's what you've given Abby. Nothin'. And there she is upstairs wanting to die.. ...'cause she's got nothin'. # 'Day dum day daum day' # # Sweet youth is for pleasure # Good morning, Walpole. Oh! I've forgotten you was counting stairs, again. That's alright, Maisie. That's quite alright. Everything's alright today. Oh yes, isn't it? How is she now? Wonderful! Dr. Fredericks couldn't believe his own eyes. Ms. Abby saw Mr. Cap on one side, Mr. Robert on the other both so deeply concerned and affectionate. Oh, yeah. They certainly turned back to tie the both of them. A new day for this house, Maisie. Hurry up, they're waiting for you. # Hey Dam Day Daum Day # # Sweet youth is for pleasure # Good morning, Nursie. Good morning, Maisie. Go right in. Oh, thanks. - 'Maisie.' - Good morning. Gee, honey, you sure gave us a scare. Cap told me something about last night. Oh, listen, last night's forgotten. You got tomorrow to think about. Everything's going to break right for you from now on. All I want is for to keep on being like this. Oh, it's going to get better. There's some grand guy walkin' around lookin' for you now. When he does, he'll follow you to the north pole if he has to. He won't have to. Attagirl. I look back, I guess I laid it on pretty thick last night. That's me, I get sown with pride. If an apology is in order, I'm making it right now. Come on, Maisie. You'd say the same and call me the same names tomorrow if you thought I had them coming to me. Now, wouldn't you? Yes, I guess, I would. Sit down, my dear. Please, sit down. Well, thanks. Maisie, we're going to Honolulu in about a week's time. 'Oh, Gee, that's wonderful.' Just from the pictures, that's always been my ideal of a place. You wouldn't be needing a maid, would you? Uh, no, I don't need a maid. I was only kidding. But I do need a companion. I don't get you. 'Not a person or dresser. A personal friend.' We're trying to say, we want you to go with us to Honolulu. 'And when we return, to live with us, here.' Hey, wait a minute. Not so fast. Oh please, say yes. Well, don't worry, just as soon as I get my breath. Gee. Fine, that's settled. We'll have a little business conference, later. And Maisie, no more uniforms. You're to be near me. Okay, Ms. Abby. Whatever you say. And no more Ms. Abby. Okay, Abby. The Mahler Brothers carnival to Honolulu inside of a month. 'The land of all opportunity is right?' Bob, I guess neither one of us thought it would turn out like this, did we? You're the only one who hasn't said anything about it. Do you.. Do you think it's kinda gotten out of hand? No, Maisie, I think it's wonderful. And if I have my way, this is only the beginning. Oh, Gee, well.. Well, I gotta go now if you'll excuse me. I want to pinch myself a few times. If I wake up, will I be mad! Are there many of these carnivals around? Ouch. Ouch! # Sweet youth is for pleasure so dogs why hear me # # Sweet youth is for pleas... # Hi Wally! Ah, Ms. Maisie. May I congratulate you? Hey, not so fast. That's not for a while. Oh, Ms. Abby told me you were to be her companion starting from today. Oh. Yeah! Isn't that swell? So much good luck. It has got me winging. Yes, things are moving rapidly. It leaves one quite breathless but most happy. Mm-hmm. You're tellin' me? I shall have some more clippings for my scrap book. Maybe even some pictures of a wedding, huh? Oh yes, of course. Oh yes! Mr. Robert will marry some day. What kind of a girl you think he'd pick, Wally? I really don't know. I don't know at all. 'She'd be beautiful. That I'm quite sure.' Charming, intelligent and well bred. 'Someone who will fit perfectly into this house.' 'Whose fine background, sound education' 'and good taste will enable her to make it a home for him.' 'And it's permissible to hope, for their children.' She'll be a lady in the finest sense of the word. I got a couple of things to do, so I... Oh, yes, of course. You're moving upstairs. Would you like Lois to help you? Oh, no thanks, Walpole. I'm used to being on my own. Well, if you prefer it. I got no choice. But thanks, Walpole. Thanks for everything. Oh, no, no. You're very welcome. Well, lady Maisie. You can't say it wasn't wonderful while it lasted. Oh, boy. We only do six shows a day. Pipes and the dogs say 16. Few laughs would fix that up. I've been after you, Maisie. What do you say? We step out tonight? Well, thanks. I wouldn't want to be the one to brake up an ideal couple like you two. Attaboy, Sonny. Maisie, do you wanna go out tonight? No, Gloria. Thanks though. Oh, be a sport for once. He's a swell fella. Not interested in fellas, honey. Hello. Bob. Seeing right here, making me comb in the city for six solid weeks trying to find you. What made you think you could get away from me? Oh, Bob. What did you have to do this for? Just when I was getting so I didn't think of you. Sometimes for as long as an hour. Just go away and leave me alone? You get your things together. I'll tell the manager you're through. - No. - Oh, yes. I know what I'm talking about. Oh, you just think you know. I can guess what went on in your head that made you run away from me. But it's all bunk, Maisie. Just bunk. Would you get it out of your mind for good? No. I was dreaming for a while but I came to and get that pink cloud out of my eyes. No, sweetie. The old cracks still goes. "East is east and..." Would you take that thing off and get your clothes on and stop quoting Kipling? Look, I'll quote you. "When a guy finds his girl he'll follow into the North Pole." Well, if this isn't the North Pole, it will do. Now, please hurry. Chasing you has lost me plenty of sleep and the factory opens at eight in the morning. - Factory? - Sure, we make airplanes. Here, this shouldn't take you long. Bob, I've been over all this. There's only one answer for us. Oh, you're right, my darling. You're so right. No! Then add it all up again because you've made a mistake. Do you get out of that rig so I can take you home or, uh.. Or do I have to help? You've no right to get me upset. I don't know if I'm sitting, standing or what? Just when I got myself so straightened out and so good. - I don't know what I'm doing. - You're doing what I tell you. - And you can't give me orders. - Oh, yes, I can. From now on. Now, what are you going to do about it? Oh, honey. What do you think?
