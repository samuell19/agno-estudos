- Oh, no. Let me have a beer, huh? What do you call that, man? Hi, Connery. Give me some peanuts, Joe. - This ought to get his attention. - Caught him with his pants down. - Yeah, you got to keep reminding these spades you don't want him using your John. - I think he got the message. - Hey, man, I didn't waste him. - Hey, man, like, cool it. The man's with me. - Yeah. - Hey, smiley, you groove when you heard my voice? - Yeah, right. - Good to see you, man. - Hey, remember those broads from riverside? - Yeah. Oh, smiley. What's the action in Bakersfield? - It's all right, man. - Is it all on, man? - Hey, old smiley took care of everything. You dig? - I dig. - We heard about this cat when we first got here, man. He ran the whole scene. It was his bag, right? - That cat's in for some witty surprise. - Oh, I'm with you, baby. Hey, give me a few minutes to get to club before you, right? - Right. - I'll get all our old boys together. Speed, nutty, tiny Tim. - Balls? - Balls. - Yeah, right. - You know where to go? - Yeah. - Just show up kind of casual like, right? Old George will never know what hit him. - Oh, get it on! - Yeah, baby! Yeah! Whoo! Yee-haw! - This is unit 408 reporting to captain bingham. The new boy just pulled out, heading north on union. - Hey. - Hey. - How you doing? - Buddy. - Hey. - I don't believe in him. - Nutty Norman, my own true love. - Hey, old mother, what are you doing around these parts? - I just came back to visit my brothers. Got out of the service, and found out everybody split out on me. The place is like a morgue back there. - Oh, baby, we didn't have any choice. The man ran US out of town. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I heard. I sort of had to split in a hurry myself. - Good old Mike. - The last we heard about you, they were, like, putting a medal on you for something or other. - Yeah. - Yeah, you were like some kind of a big gold-plated hero back home. - Oh, they give you a metal if you get out of Saigon without catching anything. - A hero. - Hey, Mike, I want you to meet some people in here. Mike, this is big George, president of our club. George, this is Mike. He used to head up our old gang at riverside. - You should have seen this guy, George. He drove the police chief crazy. - Yeah, baby, they had to fire the old one and hire a new one. - Yeah, every time we took to the road on one of our runs, he'd set the whole damn county on its ear. - Man, we were a tough bunch in those days, huh? - I'm thinking of starting up my old club, maybe even getting the old colors. How about it? Any of you guys got any eyes to trip with me? - Damn right we got eyes, right, boys? - Yeah. - Just lead the way, baby. We'll follow you to the ends of the earth. - Hey, man, let's split. It's getting to noisy in here. Connery, I'd like to talk to you outside. - Hey, let's have a party at gingers. - Hey, let's do it. Hey, Mike, wait until you see ginger's pad. You'll blow your mind, man. - Hey, baby, you'll really blow your mind when I stock it up with about 400 things. - I knew I could count on you characters. Blood is thicker than grease, huh? - Amen. - Hey, Mike, wait until you see our new pad, man. It's really... - The leader's back, man. Hey, our leader's back, man. - Hey, Connery, what kind of plans you got? Like, what are you cooking up? - Outside of going to a party, nothing. Why? - Well, I was just thinking instead of starting your own club, why don't you join ours, man? We got kind of an arrangement with the law. They don't bug US, and we don't bug them. - That's chummy, but you got your boys, and I'd like a gang of my own. - Well, you haven't run into captain bingham yet, Connery. Just try riding around this town without your colors on, and you'll find out how wrong you really are. - Hey, understand, George. You don't have to press me. You got your little thing going with the captain, okay, fine. You dig brown-nosing the law, that's your business. Go right ahead. I'll just take my boys and split. - Wait a minute, Connery. You're pushing things. - Pushing what, George? - Riding in here like some lousy scavenger, stealing off half the members of my club. - Stealing? You don't see me twisting any of their arms to ride out with me, do you? I mean, you do your little thing with the sheriff, and I'll do mine. - No! No! No! - God! - Oh, wow! - That'll break his wallet. - Give me his jacket. - Put them on, man. You're our temporary pres until we officially elect you at the party. Dig? Hey, hey, hey. Bingham. Bingham. - May I see your driver's license, please? Give me a hand, Dennis. I'll see to it that he gets to the hospital. - You got no problem, pres, as long as you keep it in the family. - Come on. - Let's go. - Hey, man. - Mike, who is gonna be the new pres? - Wait, wait. Cool it, cool it. Settle. Settle. Everyone sit down. Come on. Everybody go to the peanut gallery. Down you go. - Sit down. - Listen. Now, I know all you guys know it was a shame about George's accident, but your new board of directors have elected US a new president. - Hey, man, we don't even know the cat. - It's all right, man, 'cause he's gonna give US a little speech. - Hey, now. - 'Cause I want to hear him talk and so do you. - Hey! - Come on, man. No, you got to talk. We want to hear the new pres talk. - Yeah! Lay it on US, pres! Lay it on US! - Well, I suppose your other leaders made you a lot of nutty promises. Yeah, like a beer in every hand... Or some pot for every pot. Well, I'm not gonna make you any promises. I am gonna lay some jazz on your mind, boy. I'm gonna put some things down about the wild things I have in store for this club. - Yeah? What do you see in that sweet skull, baby? - Yeah, well, first of all, I think this farm should grow its own weed. - Hey, man, we already do that. - Yeah, but subsidized by the federal government in case of loss of crops by heat spells. - Hey, man, is something bugging you? - Yeah. Him. - Dig it! Dig it! - I hear you guys haven't had many runs that will blow your minds. How about our first run to the Rose parade in Pasadena? We'll have a chopper float, and we'll all ride next to it with beautiful broads and beautiful flowers. - Yeah, what kind of flowers? Poppies and hemp? - Yeah, poppies and hemp. - I can't dig the way he suckered George. - Hey, suckered George, man? You were there, man. You saw him pick the beef with him, right? - How about a trip to Vegas where we all have our private rooms and private baths? And for you guys that don't have your broads, private broads. - Hey... - Wow! - What kind of broad do you see me with? - Oh, I see you with a broad that is tall with long, lean legs that you just would love to climb up. - Why don't you try climbing up these, baby. - You can climb onward and upward. - But what about the vote? I thought the whole club had-- - hey, man, they voted, man. You heard it. - Sure, after your little group had already decided it in the alley. - And for my last big run, I'd like to see US take a run, a cross-country run where we organize all the clubs together, and we have 400 or 500 bikes riding through. Man, the police won't hassle US then, will they? Stick with me, and I'll make you famous. - Hey, man, you're gonna love the cat. You'll see. - Come on. And I hear that being here was forced-- - hey, man, Dennis, you're a worrier, man! This is a party! Let's relax and enjoy it. Hey, loosen up, will you? Whoa. Whoa. - We're gonna be famous! - Go with any lovers these days? - Oh, yeah! - He is the lover of the century. Nobody's safe around him. - Hey, Mike, you know what we ought to do first? We ought to all trip together, and get ready for that big winner run this weekend. - Yeah, I was thinking about it. You know, I thought I'd take you all down to meet a real live movie star. - Who's that, man? - Dude Marshall. That's who. - Hey, who's dude Marshall? - Who's dude Marshall? What's the matter? Don't you go to the drive-ins anymore. Dude Marshall's the biggest thing that hit Hollywood since Elvis. - Elvis who? - Man, what's that got to do with US? - Hey, what's the matter? Don't you want to see your old buddy? - Old buddy who? What are you talking about? - That's who. - You mean that dude is dude-- - yeah, Danny manheimer. - With short sideburns, man. - Yeah, they're one in the same. I thought we'd take our scooters and ride down there and pay old Danny a visit. He'll flip out when he sees his friends. Besides, didn't you say it was this weekend, the run? - Right. - Right? Well, we'll get Danny to run with US. - Hey. - Do you think a movie star would run with US? - Well, of course. I mean, he'll be honored that we even asked him. - Yeah! - Hey, who's that, speed? - That's ginger. She owns the whole joint, man. - Who does she swing with? - She hangs loose. She don't want anybody's colors. - I'd sure give my left thing to have her fly my colors. - Yeah. Why don't you introduce me, man? - Hey, ginger, baby. I want you to meet our new club pres, Mike Connery. - Hi. - That was quite a speech. - Yeah, well, I was practicing for when I run for congress. - Congressmen don't go around breaking people's legs. - Oh, you mean poor George? Yeah, well, damn! I'm sure sorry about that. - For someone you hardly know, how do you treat people you're really tight with? - Well, it depends. Hey, I understand you own this funny farm. - That's right. Why? - Well, it kind of sort of looks like a home for all the homeless cycling trash. - Well, I have you people here to amuse me. I like to be amused. - You haven't seen me do all my tricks yet. - Well, maybe I'll have a chance to catch your act later on. - Yeah. Maybe. - Hey, Mike. Hey, Mike, you got to see this new muffler on my bike. It's really out of sight. - No, man, I'll see it later. - What? Malik, you're gonna love my new muffler. It's a reverse cone Meg, and it's really out of sight. I mean, like, it's got more suction then a head taking his first smoke off a joint in the morning. Really. There's enough grass in there to seed a golf course. Afternoon, your flyship. - Hello, tiny. What's shaking? - Ain't nothing but the bees in the trees, captain. - Do me a favor, tiny. Go in and tell the new pres I'd like to see him. - Yes, sir, captain, sir. Right away. - I don't know where it's at. I had her number, though. - Greetings, captain. - Hello, pres. Understand you're taking over this little group. - Yeah, well, since George's untimely accident, I feel very flattered they should make me number one. - Well, that's very sporting of you to take the time off from your other activities to do this. Well, I'll make my speech as brief as I can. Now, this town's been very peaceful the past few years, and I want it to stay that way. I've laid out a few simple little rules. Any of your boys can fill you in on it. Now, there's certain sections of this town, mainly the residential areas, no bikes. You got that? - Yeah, I got it. Your town is my town. - Oh, that's good. And as their ex-leader tried to tell you, I hold the president personally responsible for the actions of the members. Now, they screw up, your neck gets chopped. Dig? - Yeah, yeah, I dig. - And you understand that you're to keep your bad habits confined strictly to this farm? - Keep the faith, captain. - Hey, come on, you guys. Let's go on a run, huh? Come on. Let's get it on! Hey, ginger, why don't you ride with the new pres, honey? - Whoo-hoo-hoo! - Hey, man, what is this? What is this? - Aw, you must be fragile. Are you fragile? Do you break? Huh? - Hey, lover, do you mind if I take him off into the bushes for a little while? - Oh, no. - Get it on, baby. Just don't take all day. - Okay! Sounds not that bad to me. - There he goes. - Yeah! We got him. There he goes. - Whoo-hoo! - Close the gate! Go on! - We got him up there now. What are we gonna do now, boys? - Hey, Mike, let's go back to ginger's. - ♪ Shake off the chain from all that ism ♪ ♪ no, you're not that E.R. gun ♪ some day no more war ♪ some day no more greed ♪ some day no more big bombs ♪ some day, well, we might not be busted ♪ ♪ some day no more taxes ♪ there's only one ♪ shake off those labels, children ♪ ♪ shake off those labels, children ♪ ♪ shake off those chains, children ♪ ♪ be free, be free, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ yeah ♪ yeah - yahoo! - Thank you, brothers.

As Peter was the Fisher of men, I am a Shepherd of men. And I'm before you, and i'm gonna tell you about the word of the lord. Now you all, I've gathered with you, I've run with you, I've partied with you, and what have I seen? I've seen you with the marijuana cigarette. I've seen you drinking wine. I've seen you with the brother booze. I've seen you take the demon into your soul. Wait a minute, brothers. We're gonna do a number. Mm. And when you've done this, brothers, the lord, god, he made US all in one likeness. He made US. All right, brothers, I'm telling you, cast out the demon! Cast out the wine! Cast out that sinner booze! Take into hearts the Jesus Christ. I say put that demon on this side, force him out of your life. Throw down your colors. I say go to church. Take Jesus Christ! Take the words of the book. Take the words of a man... - You think you can relax here? - Yeah, I think so. Where'd you get the money for this place? - I'm a lady of independent means. Can't you tell? What about you? You planning on taking a job at the packing house next? - Packing house? That's for slobs. When I get settled, I'm gonna re-open my law practice. - You're kidding. You're a lawyer? - Yeah, and a brain surgeon. Me work in a packing house? I can get a job anyplace. - What's this movie star business I've been hearing about? - Well, you mean dude Marshall. Yeah, I'm gonna take all the boys to Beverly Hills tomorrow. He's an old friend of mine. - I never did see a real movie star in the flesh before. - Well, ginger, baby, if you play your cards right, I might just let you pack with me. - What do you have in mind? - I'll think of something. - It looks like you've thought of spending the night. I have a standing rule in my house. Anybody who wants to sleep over uses the shed. - Sheds are for animals. - Not my shed. Your friends use it. Suits them fine. - Ginger, you talk too much, but you got groovy eyes. - My mouth's not talking. - Right. - I want you to understand you're my guest tonight... If you promise not to break my leg. - Break your leg? No. - That's right. Dude Marshall. Sure, you heard about him. Yeah, for that science fiction picture in Japan. Sure, I think he'd be great. Sure he would. You know he can do it. That's right. $150,000. And don't take too long to make up your mind. Well, I don't know. I'll have to ask him. Okay, call me in the morning. Right. Goodbye. Hey-- - hey. - Hey! - Hey, dude! What's up? - Dude! - Hey! - It's okay. He knows them. - Hey! - What is it? They're not friends of yours, are they? - Yes, it's a long story, baby. - No, I told you we can't make that picture for $13,000,000. That's right. Can't get Liz and dick to work for anything less than. I would take $16,000,000 and not one damn cent less. Yeah, that's right. - Groovy pad, dude. - Not bad. - Yeah. - Danny manheimer. - I've got somebody I want you fellas to meet. Sol? - Got an idea. Call you back. - I'd like to introduce you to my producer. This is my producer, sol Joseph. These are some buddies of mine from my youth days. - How about a drink? - Help yourself. It's the best, man. It's from the middle east or wherever this stuff comes from. - What about the man? - The man? - He means the police. - Oh, forget it. They work for US, right, dude? - It's cool. - You know, this gives me an idea. It's a great idea. Why don't I make one of those motorcycle gang pictures? - Well, you've sure come to the right people, sol. Jennifer, why don't you take the girls and show them around, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah. - You want to make a picture? - 8x10 or a 5x7, man? - I'd like to make a cowboy movie, huh? I'd have to really ride a horse. - I want to be an actor! - Come on with that movie shit. - Hey, Danny, I mean, dude, don't be uptight, man. We're not gonna hassle you. - It's just really a surprise, man. You know, that's not my bag. - Yeah, no, we won't bother you. - Hey, how'd you guys find me anyway? I mean, I thought you guys had forgotten all about me. - How could we forget you with your beautiful face smiling down on US? - Hey, you don't mind if I keep this for a souvenir, do you? - Mr. Joseph, give me a break. I want to do an acting job. I can do... - All right. Oh, okay. Cool it! Cool it! Louise, baby, take one of these boys inside the house where there's a tape recorder. Find out what these motorcycle gangs are all about, you know. The sex and the orgies, all that stuff. - That's where it's at, baby. - Yeah! - Yeah! - Give US a chance to capture some of this dialogue that I hear here. - Yes, sir. Come with me. - Ooh, it'd be my pleasure, lady. - Yeah! - Hey, speed, go easy on her, man. I mean, like don't bruise the chick. - Hey, speed, think of nutty, will you? And see if she wants to trip with US. Tell her we'll make her a mama. - Yeah, turn around. - Relax. - Let's go for a ride on my bike. I love my chopper. Oh, no way. No way, baby. - You smell beautiful. Relax. - I love my chopper. - What pictures have you been in? I go to a lot of movies. Maybe I've seen you in something. - Well, actually, dude's picture will be my first real acting role. Before that, I only-- - don't you miss the bugs in your teeth, tripping down the highway with the wind blowing in your face? - You know, I was telling the boys if I was only 30 years younger, I'd give all of this up, and I'd get myself a chopper and a mama, and I'd ride off in the sunset with bugs in my teeth. - He wants to know where his friends are. - They're out front. - Well, sol, baby-- oh, I mean, Mr. Joseph says it's sort of a femme fatale role. That means I drive men out of their minds. Oh, I'll bet you just do. - Hey, baby, why don't you show them out front? - With pleasure. - Hey, Mike, hold on a minute, will you? I know how hard it is for you guys to get this good stuff, so why don't you take this with you? - Thanks a lot, man. It's always appreciated. Sorry you can't make it with is on the weekend. - Well, you know how it is, man. You have to make a buck. - And I want all of you guys to be sure and keep in touch with dude and me. Do you hear? - Yeah, baby. - And I want you definitely in my next picture. - Oh, really, Mr. Joseph? Hey, is there anything you want me to do to get into shape for this movie? - Nutty, baby, sweetheart, I want you to stay just as beautiful as you are. - Oh, hey, I'm gonna be a star. - You ever change your mind, dude. Thank for the-- later. Let's move it, baby. - It's about time. - Take good care of my boys, officer. - And this bitch keeps telling me what a big important actress she is. So I asked her, "what'd you have to do to get your role?" And she says, "do? "Oh, I didn't have to do anything. "Sol, baby-- "oh, Mr. Joseph recognizes this super star quality in me." Hey, Millie, tell them what you thought of her. Get this. - She was just the lowest. - Oh, man, this Jennifer broad was gorgeous. I mean, you should have seen her bod. She was out of sight. - You've got go be joking. They were flat enough to land a plane on. - Well, captain motorcycle. Back from Hollywood? I thought you were gonna stay and become a star. - Well, I thought about it, but I decided to bring you a goody, shake up your bones. You dig? - I'd love to, but I've only got two hours. - That's all we really need. Let's get it on. - Groovy. - This your bike? - That? No, man. It's inside. - Tell me about the secretary again, man. - Well, man, she had the-- you know, the... - Any of you guys own the bikes outside? - What? - Any of you guys own the bikes outside? - I'm a helicopter pilot myself. - And I'm a brain surgeon. - And I'm a professional basketball player. You want to see me dribble? - Hey, man, listen. I'm a flamenco danger. - Yes, and I'm her silly little partner. - Yes, and I'm a seamstress. - All right, while you guys are deciding what you do for a living, I'll be outside writing tickets. - Oh, wait a minute. Oh, wait a minute. - He's a new boy. He takes his job very seriously. - Oh, yeah. - The boy scouts. - What do you expect from a rookie? All they ever teach them at cop school is how to write tickets. - Hey, man, while you write up that phony ticket, do you mind if I take a ride on that garbage scooter of yours? - Hey, do it, speed baby. - Hey, that's a good little scooter, man. - Hey! Oh! - All you pigs, man. How can you ride a bike with all the garbage on it? - Hey, man, I get this cop can't do better than 75 tops. - Oh, yeah, man. Hey, baby, you should have learned on a three-Wheeler, right? - Oh, yeah! - Why don't we save the little baby? - Now, you made me save the little baby. - Yes, save this-- save the baby. - You got to go to a boy scout meeting tonight. - The poor baby. Yeah. - Hold it right there, boy. This is officer Reynolds down at the go-go club on union street. Send down immediate assistance. - No, we're putting you on, man. - Hey, man. - Come on, man. - Up against the wall. - We're just having a little fun, you uptight cop. - Up against the wall! You hear me? Now, girls, inside! Let's go! Now! You! - Hey, man, you a nut? You flip out or something? - Back with anybody in the club? - My mother won't let me go out. I have to go straight home after work. What's that? - Oh, that's nothing. Don't worry about it. It's cool. How do you feel? - I feel beautiful. - You look beautiful. I got something very groovy for you. - Oh, yeah? - You slut! You dirty little bitch! - It wasn't like that at all. - Don't give me any of that crap, bitch! Get your clothes on. Let's get out of here! - I just wish you'd let me try and explain. - Get up and move! Move! Man, I can't trust you for a minute, can I? Come on. Out. - Now, look. - Man, if you were only a guy, I could bust you right in the mouth. Come on. Out. - Mike? Get a couch, man. Put him on the couch! I know it, man. Hey, get some water, girls. Mike! - I'll go make him some chicken soup. - Those stinking cops. - What happened, speed, baby? - Oh, my-- - who did it? - The heat. - The heat? Why? - A bum rap, Mike. A lousy bum rap. - Ah, speed chained this rookie to his bike and turned the siren on. - Hey, it was only a gag, man. He let him go in less than a minute. - And these two cops came in a squad car and hauled him off. - Yeah, we thought they were taking him down. We went out to get him. - Hey, they never got him to the station, man. This all happened in the squad car. - What are their names? - I don't know. - Damn it! I want those bastards' names. - All right, listen here, Sonny. I told you this is the first I've heard of it. Now, you cool it, and I'll look into it. - Cool it? Is that what your storm troopers did with speed? - All right, shut up! Now, I can hear you. I don't need all that noise. I've heard about all the screaming I need the night. - In case you should forget, captain, the law is for US just as much as it is for your righteous citizens. And there is a procedure for arrest, which I believe does not include working someone over in a the back seat of a patrol car before you've even booked him! - I'm fully aware that there are certain members of this police department that aren't exactly in love with your boys. - That's your hang-up, bingham. - Well, we haven't had a serious beef with your club in the last two or three years. - Well, of course you haven't had a beef. Your goons have been leaning on my boys so much they're afraid to open up their mouth 'cause you'll bust them for spreading germs! - Well, here's the way I see it, pres. Big George knew how to keep those guys in line. Now, that's something you just don't quite know how to do. - We are not talking about my club. We are talking about your cops. Now, if that's the way you want to play the game, okay. - Now, listen, Connery, you weren't even there. Now, if you give me a chance, I'll investigate this thing. - Investigate it. Oh, yeah. Well, you'll investigate it! - Sergeant, who were those two officers that answered that call over on union street at the go-go club? Well, you tell them to get their butts up here! Oh, and you better have that rookie Reynolds. Take him off the beat for about three days. Yeah. Those dummies are just stupid enough to try something. - Excuse me, officer, do you have the time? - Yeah, it's 3:00. - Thank you. - Kind of late. Would you like to sit down? - No, thank you. Just waiting for my mother. You know how it is with a young girl alone at night. - Well, you're perfectly safe here. - Well, you have to be careful with all the motorcycle gangs riding around. You know what I mean. - Yeah, I ran into a couple of them earlier this evening. - You must be terribly brave to be out here all alone at night with no one with you. - Well, it's-- - oh, there's my mother now. Thank you for the talk, officer. It's been nice. Goodbye. - Hey! - Ah, captain, big man, that was a terrible story, but I don't know why you bothered to come up here at the crack of dawn to tell it to US. It's got nothing to do it with US. We've been here all evening, haven't we, fellas? - Yeah, that's right, sheriff, big man, we've been here all night working on our bikes and playing checkers. We've been drinking milk and having little cookies. - Officer, do we look like the kind of people who would do something crazy like that? - Let me tell you something, Mr. Pres. Now, you guys are just cutting your own throats. I could have suspended those two officers. It's too late now. Every man on my force is gonna be looking for your colors. And there's not a whole lot I can do about it, I'm afraid. So do yourselves a favor and try to stay off the street. Stupid bastards. - Officer! Officer! It's okay! I'm still a virgin! - Hey, hey, you guys! Hey, I don't need hassle with the heat. So if you're going into town, don't be holding. - Hey, man, they'll probably forget about it in two days. - Yeah, that may be, but cool it anyway. - Hey, baby, let me tell you something. Your full-on super scooter trash, man. - Hey, that was the most beautiful night we ever had, man. And besides, you got to meet buff the dike. - Oh, yeah, man! Buffy! - Yeah, I think ginger introduced US. - Man, that's not like our Mike. An eye for an eye and a took for a tooth. And even the score for old speed here. Oh, yeah! - Hey, Dennis, you'd think the difference man, old George would let that mother lean on US, but not Mike, right? - Right! - Hey, ginger, baby, I never thanked you for siccing that bull dike on me. How do you like it? With or without water? Ah, leave the water on. - Hey, Dennis. - Yeah. - You got the 7/16th out here? - Yeah, baby, but I'm using it. - How come you're working on moldy's bike? - Get a new goody for my scooter. - Oh, he gave it to you, huh? - No. - Then why you taking it? - None of your business, punk! - Shh! What's all the noise about, man? - Nothing. - You're full of crap! He was burning this from moldy's bike. - Man, you call that nothing? - You dirty fink! Let's get it on! Let's get it all on! Come on! Come on! - Hold it! Hold it! What's going on? - Oh, man, he was burning from the bike. - You're a liar. - Don't burn from your own people, Dennis. Only punks do that, and we don't have any punks in this gang. So get on your scooter and fade, man. And leave your colors. - Hey, man, you can't do that to me. - I just did it. - Mike! - He's mine. I'll waste him myself. Nice blade, Dennis. Didn't your mother ever tell you never let go of it in a fight? Here. Try again. - That's your first big mistake, Connery. - Come on, Dennis. Come on. Come on. I guess he doesn't want the knife. Split, baby. - What's your problem? - Tell Norman not to hit me anymore. - Hey, man, she won't believe me. Now, tell her it's the truth, huh? - Why don't you just give up, Norman? That producer of dude's is a phony, and he's not gonna put you into any movies, nutty, baby, chicky, sweetie. Don't you hit me! - What do you mean hit you? Hey, did I ever hit any girl in my life? - Oh, yeah? Well, what do you call this? - I never hit her, man. - Oh, you didn't, Norman? - Hey, just tell her I never hit girls, huh? - You're a frickin' liar! - Nutty! Darn, nutty. - Hey, speed just went into town, and he's bringing me back some movie magazines. - Movie magazines? - Hi, speed. - What kind of magazine is that? - It's a movie magazine. It's for nutty. - Captain bingham wants to see you down at the station. - Well, for what? - It's a shame about that officer's bike being chained up last night, wasn't it? - Hey, man, I don't know what you're talking about! Let me tell you something. My pres told me you guys can't bust me unless I've done anything. You need a warrant. - You've been busted on possession before, haven't you? - Yeah, but what's that got to do with right now? - Are you shooting speed, speed? - No, I put it down, man. - What's this? - Where'd you get that? - Found it right by your bike. - Oh, man, you put it there! - What condition's he in? What do you mean you don't know his condition? Well, how did it happen? What do you mean you don't know how it happened? - Hey, where the hell is he going? - All right, what happened? - We stopped him for routine questioning. He went berserk. He tried to take a swing at derkins here. - He tried to take crawly's gun, then jumped on his chopper. - We told him to stop. - Connery. Connery! Now, I need time to investigate this thing. Look, I know you're going on your winter run tomorrow. Now, when your boys get back, I'd appreciate it if you'd keep them out on the farm, give this thing a chance to cool off. All right, now, what the hell happened? - Look, I told you he tried to get crawly's gun. - All right. Now, I've got something I want you all to understand. Now, I don't care what your personal feelings are about these kids. Just don't are about it. But let's get one thing straight. They got the same rights as anybody else. And when it becomes a crime to ride a motor bike down the street, by god, that's a sad day for all of US. Now, you get out to that farm now and watch. Stay off of their property, and you keep me informed. - Well, how bad, man? - Snuffed out. - Well, man, not speed. Not our speed! Man, what are we gonna do without him? We loved him. Everybody loved him. What are we gonna do without him, man? - Oh, wow. Why, man? Why? - They said that they pulled him over for routine questioning. Then they said that he attacked one of the officers, panicked, and ran. - That's a bunch of jazz. He was so busted up he couldn't attack anybody. - Questioning about what? - Not speed. He was too cool for that. - Yeah, unless they set him up. - That's probably what happened. They probably tried to plant something on him. - Hey, man, what about the run tomorrow, man? Is it still on? - Hell, yes, the run's on. Old speed would have wanted it. - I'm want to talk to Mike, all right? - Bye, baby. - Bye. - Bye-bye, sarge. - Unit 408 to captain bingham. - Bingham. Go ahead. - All of them just rode out heading north on 178. - You're beautiful. How long did it take you to get that way? - About a year, man. - Wow! Hey, he sure is beautiful, man. Well, it's a gas getting away from sick city. Man, we can't even walk down the sidewalks without getting hassled over our hair or our rags. - Squares don't like anything different. - Yeah, it's like we want to hurt them or something, you know? I mean, like all we want to do is be left alone to do our thing. You know, I'd like to take my people and split this whole scene. - Then why don't you? - To where, man? It's the same sick bag no matter where you go in this country. Hey, everyone's uptight over property rights. Whatever happened to civil rights? - Hip, man, that's 'cause the squares run the scene. The trick is you got to show them that you got the same kind of rights they do. You don't want them to love US. Just leave US alone. - Hey, you're beautiful too, baby. Why don't you and your people join US? - ♪ Who's gonna cry, baby? ♪ Who's gonna cry when I'm gone? ♪ ♪ Who's gonna cry 'cause of misery? ♪ ♪ Oh, you know, baby ♪ it ain't gonna be me - Hi. - Hi yourself. You want some? - No, my mom said I can't smoke any grass until I'm older. - Oh, yeah? What a bummer. - She says kids have their own high going. - Yeah, well, she's right. - You know, I love you. - Oh, yeah? How come? - 'Cause you don't take baths either. - Oh, what a put-on you are. - So beautiful. - Yeah, it looks like a cigarette commercial. - You know something? As hard as I try, I just can't picture you in the marines taking orders. - The first time they had me snowed. Of course, I was young. What the hell did I know? - Oh, is that when you got that medal the guys were talking about? - No. That was my second hitch. That's when I learned to make them think they were giving me the orders. - What did you get it for? - Get what? - The medal. - Oh. We were holding down a hill, and Charlie charged US. The lieutenant panicked. Luckily for all of US, he got snuffed out by mortar shell, and I took charge. Old Charlie was sure in for a surprise when he came over that hill. - Don't you ever make mistakes? - Yeah, I made one once. I let some stupid sheriff con me into reenlistment instead of taking a stretch. Boy, if I had known my rights then like I know them now, it'd have been a different answer. I'd probably gotten about 90 days. Then the club wouldn't have been hassled and run out of town just because I was away. I was gone four years, you know. Boy, the whole trick in life is knowing your rights. Wow. - God! - Yeah, god! She kept yelling about god over and over. That's all she kept talking about was god and love. Well, I showed her about love, and she kept screaming for god. So I told her if she wants god to help her, she's got to get in the right position to see god. - Well, we've got to get out of here fast. Hey, take nutty and go find balls. Tell him to round up everybody. Tell him we're splitting. Now, you go with smiley, nutty. Do what he says. - He's insane. He ought to be put away. - Nobody's gonna put anyone away. - Oh, no, you're not gonna get away with this this time! - Shut your yap! When we get up to the prophets, you go to the bike. You didn't see anything! Nothing! You hear? - You know, they're good people. - Everyone here, smiley? - Yeah, man, they're here, but they want to know what's happening. - Speed's funeral. That's what's happening. Have you forgotten speed? - No, man, but i-- well, I was thinking about something else. - Yeah? Like what, for instance? - Like nutty. - Oh, man, don't worry. - Hey, well, you were there, Mike. You saw the scene. - Oh, forget it. The heat doesn't like them any more than they like US. - I don't know. I sure get some bad vibes when I think about it. - Yeah, well, stop thinking about it! Start thinking about speed's funeral. Every club in the state's coming down here. I got between 400 and 500 bikes coming. - You got to be kidding. - The hell I am. Wait until you see what I've got planned. It'll bend your mind. We got to move fast. Speed's body isn't gonna be on ice forever, you know. - Yeah, but do you really think the law will come, man? - Of course they'll come. They jumped at the opportunity when I told them that dude and that sweetie baby producer friend were gonna use the whole procession in the next movie. I got it all figured. - Oh, man, I don't think it'll work. - It'll work. Just take my word for it. - Yeah, but, Mike, man, how are you gonna control it? 500 bikes? It'll be a disaster. - Disaster? It'll be beautiful. And besides, don't you think we owe speed something? - Yeah, man, but this is the same kind of scene that's got US burned before. - Hey, listen, buddy. The only reason you got burned was because I wasn't there. If I had been there, it'd been a different story. - Yeah, yeah, I know, man, but hey. We barely got out of that scene today at the park, if we got out of it. Well, I'm tired of getting kicked out of places, you know? I'm kind of getting used to this town, and I like it. And I'd like to stay around, so count me out. - Nobody splits on me! - Hey, man, it's me, smiley! - How come everyone's hanging around? - Man, why don't you keep the boys entertained. Tell them what we figured out, huh? Okay? - Yeah. - What the hell was that all about? Nutty? - No, we were just discussing the funeral. - What about the funeral? Well? - Well, I was just telling him about our plans to bring in all the other clubs for the procession. And how it's gonna get television and radio coverage. That's all. - You mean to tell me that you're planning on bringing all those bike rats into this town for the funeral? - Yeah. - Oh, god, you'd have a riot. I mean, any one of those characters is liable to flip out. - No, not anyone. Nutty. - Nutty. That poor creep ought to be put away. I mean, you can't let him walk around without a leash. - He's no problem. I can handle him. - You can't handle nothing. You've been in this town less than one week, and already it's not safe for any of those poor slobs to ride their bike through town without getting run down by the heat. - Well, I think there'll be a change. - Oh, sure, there'll be a change. You'll all end up in prison. - He won't get more than 30 days. - Oh, yeah? If I know bingham, that'll be the end of this club. - Are you stupid? Are you stupid? Have you lost all your brains? Do you know how many poor slobs are out there that have no place to belong to? Wow! Dig. Television, radio, newspapers. Why, when they see that in the headlines, man, they'll come here by the thousands! They'll be knocking down our doors to get in! Why, we'll take this chapter, and we'll make 15, 20 clubs! We won't have 500 bikes. We'll have 1000! I'll have a mother loving army, a whole army! - You know something? It's not nutty who should be put away. It's you. You're insane. - I'm brilliant. - Look, I want you to get out of here right now. - Hey, what's the matter, ginger, baby? I don't amuse you anymore? - Not anymore! Just get on your bike and get the hell out of here! - All right, outside. Move! - You better have a warrant. - I said outside. - Sieg heil. - Oh, look at the pretty boy with the gun, man. - Here comes the man. - Hello, captain. - Hey, man. Hands up, right? - What's the score, baby? You gonna turn our backs to the wall? You want our hands up or what, baby? Tell US. - Come on. - Oh, look at the pretty boy with the gun. - Here comes the man. - What the hell is going on, bingham? - All right, gentlemen. Take off your colors. - Hey, captain, you got to be kidding! - Oh, no. - Come on, man. - You'll survive. - I want to see your search warrant, bingham. This is a private property! You can't do this to US! - Yeah! - Hey, bingham! What the hell? You gonna let him get away with that? - I said take off your colors. - Now, hold that jazz! Stay where you are! - Come on, Norman. Let's take a walk. All right, this is it. Now, I want you to pack up and get out of here. And I mean out of the county. Now, if I catch one of you guys hanging around after the noon hour tomorrow, then you're going to jail, and you're going for a long, long time, because you guys have had it. There's no place left for you. No place. I don't even think the zoos would want you. - Hey, just what the hell are you putting down? You can't do this to US. What'd we do? What's the charge? You know, we're citizens. We have rights. You know, the law wasn't just designed to protect the squares. It was designed to protect US too. All right, damn it! It's no kick, is it? Is that the way you want to play the game? Okay, we'll play it that way because I've taken all the crap from you I can swallow, bingham! Now, we're splitting. You dig? - Yeah. So why don't you leave? Nobody's gonna stop you. Now hear me! Put them down. He's free to leave. And that goes for your friends too. - Yeah, this is a free country. You can't tell US what to do. - You're free to go, Connery. Don't you think you ought to button up your shirt first? - You're damn right we're free to leave. Smiley, get my bike. We're splitting. Smiley, get the bike! We're splitting! - Get his bike. - I got a big surprise for you, bingo. One of your gestapos killed an innocent citizen, speed. And when we come back to the funeral, I'm gonna bring 500 choppers in through your town, and there's nothing you're gonna do about it! The whole world's gonna know, bingo! The TV and the movie people! They'll all be at the funeral! Eye for an eye! I hope there's something left of your city! You hear me?
