MAN [ON RADIO]: As his sweep of the United States comes to a close, President Jonathan Hayes completes his fundraising efforts tonight at the Beverly Hills home of close friend and Academy Award-winning director, Michael Zebel. K.F.S. traffic reporter Danny Jackson suggests alternate routes around Benedict Canyon due to congestion resulting from the president's visit. I.D., please. [INDISTINCT DIALOGUE] [BAND PLAYING JAZZ] [FLY BUZZING] Why don't you just shoot it? Believe me, I'm ready to. McGregor, we're moving to the next event in five. The president's with his daughter in the study. Motorcade's out front. Don't get lost. We're moving out in five. [♪♪♪] You do this every time that we're in L.A. and you two get together. Dad, it's just a couple of Cassie's friends going to a club, I'll go incognito. I have no problem with you going, but it hasn't been checked out. Well, that's just it. If you did, there'd be 50,000 photographers, a secured area and zero chance of me having any fun. It'd be a total fishbowl. Honey, you're not going, so please stop asking. Come on, it's not fair. I'm sorry. Unfortunately, it comes with the territory. Yeah, yours. And just for the record, this sucks. [KNOCKING] Excuse me. Ready when you are, Mr. President. Thanks, Alex. I want to go back to the hotel. We need a transport to take Jess back to the hotel. MAN [ON RADIO]: Roger that. When we lost Janet, I-I-I knew it was gonna be hard, but, boy, I don't know how single parents manage it. She is really going through something. Sixteen wasn't my best year either. Heh, heh, heh. Maybe. But I don't think being the president's daughter is helping any. Uh-oh, Jess isn't gonna be happy about leaving this behind. Smash Mouth? Don't look at me. I grew up on KISS. I'll make sure she gets this. I feel bad. She's right, you know. The poor kid never gets to do anything normal. Hasn't even got her license yet. I keep promising to teach her to drive. I just haven't had the time. Well, maybe you could surprise her with something that would feel less presidential. Thank you. Thank you. [♪♪♪] I'm counting on your support. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Thank you for joining us. Thanks for coming. It's very nice to have had you here. I appreciate it very much. Thank you. All right. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot for coming. [GRUNTS] [WOMAN SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] Get down! Where's the shooter?! I don't know! We don't have a visual. [YELLING INDISTINCTLY] Alex, come on, get the president to the limo, quick! Go, go, go, go! Stay down. We got a code nine, I repeat, code nine. We need air and ground support. Infiltration point, south sector. On the floor. Are you okay, sir? I-- Yeah, I think so. I gotta get us out of here. Take him out, down the driveway. The shooter's about to launch something. Take him out. Alex, Alex? ALEX: He's okay. We're in trouble here. He's reloading. Doesn't anybody see him? He's on the right side of the driveway, behind the tree. Take him out! We gotta move! DALEY: No, you're safer in the car. No, we gotta move! I said stay with the car! It can't handle another hit! We gotta move. Come on. Alex, you got two of them after you. They're coming up behind. Post, where's my backup? Coming up, Benedict, now, sir. E.T.A. is less than a minute. We may not have a minute. Come on. ALEX: Go, go, go! Stay down! Stay down! [GRUNTS] They've got us trapped in the pool house. [YELLS] MAN: All clear, all clear! Where is he? Get the president. Sir. Sir, are you all right? Yes, yes, I'm all right. Let's get the president to the chopper. Move, move, move! You wait inside. I'll deal with you later. Move, move! [SIRENS SOUNDING] [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] What the hell is wrong with you, McGregor? You rewrite procedure. You know how lucky we were? I did what I thought was best. You ignored a direct command! I had to get us out of there, sir. I-I couldn't identify what was being launched. For your information, in case you missed it in basic training, that limousine is designed to withstand heavy artillery. I don't believe it could have taken a second hit. The first one nearly ripped us apart. You took a hell of a chance on a gut feeling. Around here, we do things by the book. Your willingness to take risks with the president ends here and now. You are off my detail, and if I have my way, out of the Secret Service permanently. [♪♪♪] [BEEPING] We got company. Damn it. We tripped something out there. [FLOOR CREAKS] Walters. Sir. [GRUNTS] Tunnel heading east. We're on it! Check it out. [BEEPING] Watch your butt, Walters. Let's go! There's something moving fast, and it's not a gopher. Drop your weapons. Drop your weapons. Figures the man responsible for trying to kill the president would be crawling out of some hole. Gentlemen, American Freedom Fighter, Michael Smith. There's another tunnel down here. Search it. Get him out. Come on, get him out! Down! [METAL CLICKS] Oh, my God. Oh, oh, oh. Oh. What the hell was that? Where's Michael? He's supposed to be here. I'm going back. Don't be stupid. Let go of me. He'd do it for us. No, he wouldn't. Haven't you learned anything from him, huh? Eric, let's go. NEWSCASTER [ON TV]: The exhaustive manhunt for American Freedom Fighter, Michael Smith, the man allegedly responsible for coordinating the assassination attempt on the president, concluded today in Montana, where F.B.I. agents apprehended him in a remote cabin outside of Whitefish. More news and coverage as our story unfolds. PRESIDENT: The bottom line is, we need to work together on this. No more backroom politics. It's killing this issue. I would appreciate it. Thank you, senator. Another four years of this? [BOTH CHUCKLE] Enough of that. Please, sit down. It's good to see you. Thanks for coming in. It's my pleasure, sir. So, did you hear why Michael Smith was trying to terminate my services? Something about the A.T.F. raid in Michigan? Several of his men were killed. Blamed my anti-militia campaign. Never mind that they were holding women and children as hostages. I'm glad it's over, sir. Me too. Daley told me that, uh, the inquiry is nearly over. They're just gonna run some sort of explosive test on the limousine. Alex, I, uh-- For whatever it's worth, sir, I expect you to stand by the results of that test. If I was wrong for pulling you out of that car, I shouldn't be protecting you. Well, for whatever it's worth, I trust you and your instincts. Thank you, sir. Open it. Oh. I remember you telling me that your mother gave you the ones you lost. They're just like them. Thank you very much, sir. Here, try it on. I, uh, took you up on your advice about doing something special for Jess. I've arranged for her and Cassie to go on one of those Outbound Adventures with some other kids. Oh, that's great. I'm trying to keep this as normal as possible for her, so we've scaled down the detail to three agents. I'd like for you to be the special agent in charge. It'll be low-key. The public will think that she's at Camp David with me for the week. I'm flattered, sir, but what about Daley? Here, let me help you with that. To be perfectly honest, he's against it. How about it? I think it might do you some good to be out of Washington, get a little fresh air. Do you know what I mean? I appreciate it, sir. Hey, kiddo. Hey. Uh, guess what? Alex got her job back? How'd you like to go on a trip? Thanks, but no thanks. Our last one was kind of hard to forget. Just you and Cassie and a few other kids. Yeah, right, some press picture crusade? It's an Outbound trip. River rafting, rock climbing, backpacking and only three agents. It's the best that I could do. No way. Way. I didn't want your entire summer to suck. Dad, this is so cool. I have to tell Cassie. She's gonna freak. She already did. Wait, when is this? Day after tomorrow. This is so great. Wait, what am I supposed to bring? Oh, Alex'll give you a list of everything you need. She's coming? Oh, I thought they kicked her out or something. [OWL HOOTING] [♪♪♪] CLIFF: Listen, Alex, Daley's expecting us to call him as soon as we get in and give him the details for tomorrow. ALEX: That's a good idea, Cliff. You do that. What's that smell? That would be pine. Oh. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Listen, uh, I'm gonna go call Daley, okay? Yeah, fine. Hey. Hey. Oh, my gosh. It's our graduation photo. A couple of tough-looking agents, weren't we? [LAUGHS] So, did Kyle Kessler meet the Falcon? Yeah, except it was a trap. Ooh. "There was a breath of a whisper "in the biting night air, but Secret Service agent "Kyle Kessler knew he was trapped, "plunging into the mighty Colorado "and taking his chances fighting the ferocious, "twisting, frothing beast whose angry current could swallow him whole." What do you think? Pretty good, huh? You spelled ferocious wrong. Yeah. You didn't like it? Oh, no, it was wonderful. Kyle Kessler is the perfect agent. [KNOCKING] Hey. Oh. Need something? We're kind of busy. Well, I just wanted to bring you this. It's digital. It's supposed to be pretty good. I'm sorry about your last one. Cool. Any CDs? I thought you could pick some up tomorrow. Oh. I didn't see any Tower Records on our way here. Well, it's a radio too. Oh, by the way, tomorrow, I want you to wear sunglasses and a hat, okay? No sunscreen? I don't care. Look, I just don't want you to be recognized by anybody in town. You're supposed to be at Camp David. When we're on the river, you can do whatever you want. What's with that? What? You. Bitch ring a bell? Whatever. She thinks she's my mom or something. [BAND PLAYING COUNTRY MUSIC] MAN: ♪ Perfect ruby lips And flowing hair ♪ ♪ Make all the men in Texas Stop and stare ♪ ♪ And when she said yes To my drink ♪ ♪ My heart... ♪ You know how to two-step? No, I don't. Then I'll teach you. Come on. No, thank you. I have to get up early. I'm not letting you get out of here unless have a dance with me. I said no thank you. No, don't be like that. [GRUNTS] Okay, all right, so you like to lead. That-- That hurts. Really? I feel for you. Kind of hard to two-step with a shattered wrist, but if you like, I'll snap this thing, and I'll get up and dance. If not, I suggest you take no for an answer and leave me alone. I can pretty much guarantee you that. Let it go. Heh. Oh. Yeah. WOMAN: Yeah, I even got thermals and the other stuff on the list, You know I didn't know that Karen made outdoor wear. Fashion first, Mark. Last minute check. If you got everything, just-- Excuse me. You must be Emma. I'm Alex McGregor, agent in charge. I heard you'd be joining us. This is Jessica and Cassie. Hey, girls. Hi. Just call me Jess. Sure. I'll introduce you to the rest of the gang. This is Katelin, Connor, Hannah, Payden. Over there is Milo. There's another instructor, a Grant Coleman? I spoke to him on the phone. Where's he? Here, now. Thanks. EMMA: Okay, guys... GIRL: So you're the president's daughter. [GROUP CHATTERS INDISTINCTLY] I'm Agent McGregor. I was afraid of that. I guess I should apologize for last night. It was a long day, and I was really in no mood. I hope there are no hard feelings. Last time I touched that, uh, it hurt. Yeah. Em, did you get everybody to sign a medical release, insurance forms and we got all the-- all the bags? Everything. Good. There's-- all right... I'm gonna go get some sunscreen. Do you want anything? No? Just round up these kids, we'll go over regulations, check the revisions, and then, uh, well, we get out of here. [SIGHS] Here we go. GRANT: All right, guys, everybody gather around. There are a couple of things I want to make perfectly clear to you all. This river is beautiful, but it can be dangerous, even deadly, if you don't handle it and yourselves properly. So we're gonna need to learn to work together, become a team. All right, well, that... That's not gonna be easy. Still want you to have fun, okay? The next seven days could be the most exciting week you've ever experienced. You might even find out something about yourself you never knew. Now Emma and I are gonna be teaching you some elements of rafting, rock climbing, survival techniques, and if there's time, I will throw in some of my personal fly-fishing secrets. Miss McGregor, Jess and Cassie, you're in Emma's raft, along with Milo, Katelin and Connor. The rest of you are with me. All right, let's get rafting. Wait a second. Wait. Oh, right, right, right. Your two gentlemen friends will need to split up, one in each boat, weight disbursement. It doesn't matter to which. Hey, hey, hey. I'm curious. Who's the better rafter between you and Emma? I have more experience, but-- Then I want Jess and I reassigned to your boat. I'm sorry, but everyone's treated the same here, Miss McGregor. It's the way we-- Honestly, the last place in the world I want to be is in your boat, but when it comes to Jess's safety, no matter how small the margin, that's where she'll be, and if you got a problem with that, call her father. Tell him you don't like the way things are running. JESS: How bad is it gonna get? GRANT: Don't worry. Emma and I've been through this 100 times. We've only lost a few kids, right, Em? EMMA: Yep. I know it was less than ten. All right. GIRL: Milo-- Huh? --don't fall in. Uh-uh. GRANT: All right, after this run, we're gonna come to a small eddy where there's a little beach. We gotta make it into that beach. It's very important to make it into the beach and not be sucked down into Hell's Half Mile. You're gonna be exhausted. We gotta make it to that beach, you understand? Anyone ever run Hell's Half Mile? No one's that crazy. It's far too dangerous. Em, scoot the high point, ride the left chute. Got it. GRANT: Here we go! No, no, no, no, no. [ALL SCREAMING] [♪♪♪] Paddle hard! We gotta stay high. Paddle on the right. Stay off of that rock! Well done, group. I believe this is yours. Thanks. All right, you're doing great, Cassie. Keep going. Is this the fun part in your brochure? Make it fun. Challenge yourself. GIRL 1: Yeah, you can do it, Cassie. Come on. GIRL 2: Keep going. EMMA: Keep your focus at the top. You know, Cassie's dad's won an Oscar. I think maybe I should pitch my book to her and get her to make it into a movie. But you haven't even finished it yet. You know, that's how Hollywood works, babe. It'd be a dream come true. I thought being an agent was your dream come true. Where does it say you gotta be locked into one dream? It cracks me up, people put them on hold, and before they know it, it's too late. You know, if I die tomorrow, I'm gonna have no regrets. You gotta learn how to fly, Alex, sooner, not later. I can't go any further. Let me down. Sure you can. You're almost to the top. [VOICES OVERLAPPING] [SCREAMS] [GROUP GASPS] All right. Good work. All right. Miss McGregor, you think you can make it? I'm not a climber. Thanks. Ah. Not much for trying anything new, are you? GROUP: Ooh. Hold this, please. Look, I'll make you a deal. If I get to the top, you drop the McGregor and call me Alex. And if you don't? I'll ride in the other boat. Deal. Emma? EMMA: Yeah? GRANT: Bring in the harness. Here you go. What's she trying to prove? I don't know. How about trying to get to the top? Never climbed before. I know Daley doesn't like her because he thinks she's after his job, but what about you? She's eye candy in the department, pushed up fast only because she's a good-looking woman and friends with the president. Department's going for P.R. What, you ever think she's trying to prove she's not? Can I give you a hand? I got it. GRANT: All right. GIRL: She's climbing. GRANT: Easy. [GRUNTS] Come on, Alex, come on. You can do it now. EMMA: You can do it. MAN: She's got it. MAN: Watch inside. What's her problem anyway? Is it me or just men in general? She's not into men, if you know what I mean. That explains a lot. MAN: Just above your right hand. [GRUNTS] EMMA: Good job. GRANT: All right. Made it. [APPLAUSE] Guess I lose. Let's give your casting a try here. Little longer on your back cast. Okay, keep that wrist nice and firm. Here we go. He's cute. Look at his butt. As if I'd scam. JESS: He just seems so different. Than what? You go to an all girls' school. [BOTH GIGGLING] So, you ever gonna talk to him or just keep doing the voyeur thing? Connor... [GIGGLES] You're gonna shake hands with the rod. Look, now's your chance. Okay. Oh, hi. Hi. What are you listening to? Sorry. What? What are you listening to? Oh, it's just Everclear. Oh. They're pretty cool. What about you? Uh...just some country music station. It's really the only thing that comes in up here. I forgot my CDs. Bummer. Yeah. Bummer. Daley doesn't know it, but I would have taken this assignment as vacation time. It's incredible here. I feel guilty calling this work. You're thinking about the inquiry, aren't you? Yeah. I just keep going over and over it in my head and I... I don't think I would have done differently. Alex, you... You made a judgment call and you went with it. If you don't have a gut feeling, you have nothing. See, and yours is what makes you a great agent. If I was wrong, I could have gotten him killed. [PHONE RINGS] Agent McGregor. Hello, Mr. President. What's with these bodyguards? Is your old man rich or something? You don't know who I am? No. Should I? Are you serious? You don't watch TV or read the newspapers or anything? No. My father's the president of the United States. So, these guys with you are like Secret Service agents, huh? Yeah. What a drag. [CHUCKLES] What's funny? It's not the way people usually react when I tell them who I am. Jess, it's for you. It's your dad. Hi, Daddy. Want to say hi to Milo? Hey, man. How's it going? JESS: Fine, Daddy, I'm having a great time. Miss McGregor... Alex, I just... I just wanted to say that I, I understand why you reacted the way you did the other night at the motel. I just want to say I'm sorry. Well, thank you. Apology accepted. Okay. GRANT: Everybody, let's bring them in. It's getting dark. We got a big day ahead of us tomorrow. Let's go, chow time. MAN: All right. Let's do it . [♪♪♪] I thought you said the buck ran up here. It did. TROY: Guys... Something's strange here. What? It's just those Outbound kids I saw in town. What do you see? What's an Outbound group doing with guns? Who's getting all the protection? Who needs three bodyguards? I think we just found Michael's ticket home. [♪♪♪] Done. Good morning. Did you sleep well? Don't do the chipper thing, okay? Takes me a while to wake up. So, where's Jess? Want to thank her for leaving the back of the tent open. Woke up freezing half to death. She's not in the tent? Well, I didn't check the East Wing. Jess? Jess? What's wrong? Jess is gone. Jess? Come on, let's go. What's going on? Jess?! Okay, everyone, Jess is gone. I want everyone to spread out and start searching. Jess! MAN: Let's go. Follow me. ALEX: Come on, let's go. AGENT: Jess! Jess! Jess! Jess! MAN: Where are you? Jess! Jess! [SHOUTING CONTINUES] MARK: Alex, over here. [MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES] Jess? [MUSIC STOPS] [GROUP LAUGHING] GRANT: All right. Hey. Since everybody's up, let's break camp. We got a big hike in front of us today. [LAUGHTER CONTINUES] I said show's over. JESS: Why are you trying to ruin this for me? Hey, don't turn this around. You know the rules. Give me a break. We're in the middle of nowhere. Don't you get it? Nowhere! [ECHOING] Hear that? Nowhere! God, I hate you. Look, you're not at the top of my list, either. But like it or not, I got a job to do. Why don't you stop with the spoiled, pain in the butt, little brat attitude and give me a break? Back off, lady. [♪♪♪] Hey, you don't have any brothers or sisters, nieces or nephews, do you? No. And you're asking because... Because you lack ability of being able to relate to kids or listen to what they have to say. What's going on between you and Jess is directly affecting everyone here, and I'm tired of it as everyone else is. This trip is designed to be challenging and fun. You got it? Just...fun. So, president's daughter or not, this stops now. Okay? MAN: Go ahead and stow that. ALEX: Jess... Can we talk? I'm trying here. It's been a long time since I was 16. You gotta work with me. I'm just doing my job. Again with just doing your job. Don't you think I know that? Well, then I don't understand what this is all about. Because that's all it ever is to you. You don't care about me or how I feel. I'm just something you need to protect while you move in on my dad. I don't want another mother. Jess, your father and I are just friends. Yeah, right. Then why'd he give you that necklace? He was replacing the one that broke when we were attacked. He knew it was special to me. It was my mother's, and... That's why we're friends. I know what that must have looked like to you, but... I promise you that my feelings for your father are nothing but admiration and respect. [♪♪♪] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Hey. Wow! What? She thought I was having an affair with her father. That's so weird. I did too. Thanks. I guess Kyle Kessler would have handled things a little bit better, huh? No, she did just fine. She? Alex, I based that character on you. Since I'm such a gentleman, ladies first. Kyle Kessler, huh? Now don't start getting cocky on me. [GUNSHOT] [GROUP SCREAMING] Alex... Stay down! Alex! Jess! [GUN FIRES] JESS: Alex! Alex! [GRUNTS] Oh. Oh, God. You all right? [GROANS] GRANT: Stay back. [GASPS] Are they... Dead. They took the guns and phones too. Oh, my God. What happened? He kicked me in the head. How many were there? Three. They took Jess. Where did they go? That way. It-It happened fast. Emma, were you shot? No, I fell. Twisted my knee pretty bad. That's it, everybody, get your stuff, we're going back to right town now. Emma, take the kids back to town yourself. Grant, you come with me. Help me track these guys. My responsibility is get these kids back safely. They're not in danger here. We were hit by pros. If these kids, you or Emma were any threat, you'd all be dead. Every second arguing this, they're getting further away. We catch up, then what? You said these guys are pros. I care about Jess too, but committing suicide trying to chase her, it doesn't do any good. We gotta get back to town and get help. What's that, a .38? Cassie, when you get to town, Call the White House, okay? It's okay. I know the number. I want you to call Daley directly, okay? I'm counting on you. Let's go. [GASPS] The trail's back here. Why'd you change your mind? Because it's gonna rain. And there's not gonna be a trail for anyone to follow. BOY: You're doing great, Emma. Wait. GRANT: No one's there. How do you know? The bird. Stay here. [FLOOR CREAKS] I told you no one was here. Yeah, the bird. Didn't strike me as a pet. I picked up some tracks out behind the cabin. Mean anything to you? A lot. They're American Freedom Fighters. Part of the same group that tried to assassinate the president. [METAL CLINKS] [GASPS] What-- What was that? I triggered something. Let's get out of here. If-- If I lift my foot, it'll blow. You're sure it just wasn't... Don't! Don't move. They wouldn't place just one. There's got to be more. What do you want me to do? I want you to go after Jess. If both of us die, she doesn't have a chance. Now, please, just go. A better idea. I'll go outside. I'll go underneath the cabin... Don't be stupid. That'll be rigged too. Look, you don't have anything to prove to me. Neither do you. I'm not walking. One of us has to keep on their trail. It's not gonna be me. Every second we stand arguing about this, they're getting further away. Stop it. Now listen to me. Go. You ever play Battleship as a kid? The only way to win is to separate your ships. Never line them up in a row. I am gonna hit you like a linebacker and we are gonna go out through that door behind you. You don't have to do this. I know. We make it out of here, you owe me a dance. You got it. One... Two... Three! [♪♪♪] Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Oh. Come on. I owe you my life. No. Just a dance. JESS: Please. Please. Please don't hurt me. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. Do as you're told, and you won't get hurt. Okay? Satellite's set. DIRK: Troy, come in. Dirk, come in. I got one relay set, one more R.D.L. to put up, and we're in business. Over. TROY: Get back here as soon as you can. DALEY: A radio station in Denver received a feed from somewhere in the Rockies. maybe ten minutes ago. Tell the Sheriff's Department I do not... Repeat, do not want anyone to do anything until we've figured this out. You make damn sure they keep a lid on this. We do not want the press igniting fuses out there. Sir? Let's see it. TROY [ON TV]: Talk! Do it! [JESS SOBS] JESS [ON TV]: Daddy... Alex, Mark and Cliff are dead. They killed them. They'll kill me too if you don't do what they say. Remember Michigan? I do. We lost men that day. Is it chance or destiny that unites opportunity with cause or just plain good old luck? Either way I'm not complaining. We'd like to make a little exchange with you. We both have someone we'd like back. Let's ratify your fair trade agreement, shall we? We'd like Michael Smith released, or your daughter's dead. We'll let you know how and when very soon. [JESS SOBBING] The station in Denver tried to retrace the signal, but they must have used some sort of M.S.S. Talk English to me, Josh. It's a military scrambling system. So we don't know where they are? Not exactly, no. Well, who the hell is this guy? His name is Troy Nelson. He's one of Michael Smith's followers. Perhaps someone can tell me how we ever let Jess get near there if there was even a remote possibility of this? It's so remote, they settled there for the reason as we did. There was no way of knowing. Because of that, Jess should never have been allowed. WAKE: Sir, we all accept responsibility for this. So what do we do now? We have Lloyd Mason from the F.B.I. on his way. He was tracking these guys long before they tried anything on you, hopefully he can give us more information. DAN: It's a long shot, but I'll get people working on a satellite trace. Sir, I apologize for assigning Agent McGregor to this. I'll take full responsibility. She's dead. Maybe it's time you gave her a break. Finally. Emma, you've gotta let me run ahead. This is taking way too long. Please. She's my friend. Stick to the trail. Where it forks, go left. Wind down the rock face. There's a cabin not far after that. Milo, you go with her. Okay. Come on. Want a drink? Thanks. Thanks. I think we got off to a bad start. No, I deserved it. I had a couple of beers. I got a little cocky. I saw you come in. I thought, well, maybe... I'm sorry, I didn't realize you're a lesbian. I bet Jess told you that. Yeah. Yeah. Y-Y-You're not? No. Oh. There's a house. There's a house. Hey! Hey! We need to use your phone. I have to call the White House, right now. MASON: The Nelson brothers and Dirk Lindman, sir. They're more or less a demolition team that moved about according to Smith's needs. For argument's sake, say we gave them Michael Smith. Would they give Jess back? Not a chance, sir. BEDFORD: Excuse me, Sir. Cassie Zibal's on the phone. Says that McGregor gave her your direct number. McGregor? She's alive. She's going after these guys. [LIGHTNING CRASHES] I don't understand why we can't keep going. The tracks will be washed out. Look, we might have lost the tracks, but we haven't lost them. How do you figure? Seven Peaks. They gotta be headed to Seven Peaks. The only place they cross the river or get back on it. If they get on the river, we've lost them. [LIGHTNING CRASHES] Look, I know a shortcut, but... But what? It's radical. How radical? Straight up. [LIGHTNING CRASHES] I can do it. Let's go. Let's go. [LIGHTNING CRASHES] Let's go. ERIC: How's it going? Check the scanner, okay? Here. Why are you doing this? Troy says we gotta stand up for what we believe in. Do you do everything Troy says? He's my brother. Cain and Abel were brothers. Infrared crossovers. A lot of feedback. Going somewhere? [GRUNTS] There's a watch tower at the top. It should be equipped with a long range radio. With any luck, we can get some help and get to Seven Peaks. [GRUNTS] Oh. Oh, my God. Don't think about it. Don't think about it. Oh. It's difficult when you're a few... 100 feet in the air without a rope. GRANT: You're thinking about it. Just keep imagining that you're only two feet off of the ground. I can't get a hold. Grant, I can't get a hold! Don't look at me. Find a place to put your foot. Ok, ok, ok. You got it? Yeah. All right, here we go. Sir, the Denver station's putting a second transmission through now. TROY: Okay, here's the deal. Tomorrow morning at 8:00, you'll have a helicopter bring Michael to a bridge that crosses the river at Seven Peaks. Land on the east side. If Michael's alone and we don't pick up any activity within a 50-mile radius, we'll release your daughter within two hours, unharmed. Call it a safeguard. You're not there precisely at 8:00, we'll assume Michael's life is worth more than your daughter's, and she'll be terminated, which, by the way, you and the rest of the world will get to see on tape. Why didn't they show Jess? MASON: Playing with you. Make you push to get Smith released. We need maps, photos, tour brochures. I don't care. I want to know every inch of that Seven Peaks area. He can't be serious. He is. JOSH: This guy's smart. He's not giving us any chance to negotiate. Zero leverage. We can drop a team in there tonight. Take 'em out as the helicopter lands. They picked that place carefully. They're not gonna let anyone get close. There's no way three guys could monitor a radius of 50 miles, is there? Low altitude KX-3s, some scanners, radar, stub reflectors. Sure they can. What about on foot? It took six of us eight hours to go three miles to get through their defenses. We still let them know we were coming. We have to think of something! How are we gonna get around Michael Smith? I don't care. Get Air Force One ready. I want to get out there. Sure. [GRUNTING] It's locked. That's all right. Oh, please, God. Hang on. Runs on solar. ALEX: Tell me there's a stored charge. [BEEPS] Ah, yes! Full. Great. [RADIO STATIC] [TAPPING] What are you doing? Our friends out there will no doubt be monitoring the airwaves. So I'm sending a signal to the computer. It'll jacket the frequency, and we'll have a secure channel. Then I can talk. The 2B-40 satellite photo of Seven Peaks, uh, confirmed four people. They're working alone. Cassie confirmed there were only three of them. When we land, one of them will be watching us to make sure we don't pull anything. That leaves two on the other side. No doubt, one of them will be with Jessica. I assume the other will be on the bridge waiting for Smith. If we can get them to show us Jessica, get her out in the open, we can make our move. I need to know the risk factor for her. It might be better to, uh... Sir, it's McGregor. She's on a two-way from some watchtower. Alex? ALEX: Yes, sir. PRESIDENT: You all right? Fine, Sir. Did Cassie get a hold of you? PRESIDENT: Yes. They're American Freedom Fighters, sir. We know where they're heading. They've already contacted us. What do they want? PRESIDENT: A trade-- Jess for Michael Smith, tomorrow morning at 8:00. GRANT: Where? PRESIDENT: A place called Seven Peaks. You must be Grant. Yes, sir. I'm grateful to have you on board. GRANT: We're near Cotton Ridge. DALEY: That's here. And, gentlemen, AWAC have confirmed their radar fanning points-- here, here, and here. What are you getting at? Anything outside that triangle, high or low, will be picked up by their radar. And Grant and Alex are here. My God, they're already inside. WAKE: Grant, how well do you know this area? GRANT: It's my backyard, sir. WAKE: If he can get Alex close enough to these guys, then-- then she can cover Jess when we come in. She'll be on their side. They won't expect someone from behind. What do you think, Alex? I think it's time to get your daughter back, sir. Sir, Air Force One is ready. GRANT: I'll get one of the rafts, sneak it under the bridge. You follow the canyon around here and start your climb. A lot of cover in there. Think you can handle it? Don't worry about me. I'll be waiting for you and Jess. You just get her into that water. When you're ready to climb, stay to the left side of the face. It's easier from there. Remember, you're always only just two feet off of the ground, all right? It'll be a piece of cake. What? Nothing. What was that look? Just a moment of admiration. For-- For what? Are you fishing for compliments? It was my moment. No. No. Just, uh, curious. Look, we couldn't have come this far or done any of this without you. Yeah? Well, I don't know anybody who'd chase three heavily armed men with nothing but a .38 out into a wilderness area without an ounce of survival training or equipment, and never once think of herself. I'll see you there. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES] Left the rappel gear down near the bridge. Boat's ready too. Good. They're gonna need to see the girl before the exchange. So we'll get you to bring her out for a look. After that, take her out. Okay? Okay? Okay. [♪♪♪] [ROCKS FALLING] [ROCKS FALLING] Yeah, right, two feet. [BIRD FLUTTERS AWAY] [♪♪♪] Daley, I'm in position. DALEY: Copy that. Chopper's on its way. Hold tight. ALEX: I think there may be a way to talk to Jess. DALEY: How? ALEX: She's listening to the radio, some country station. It's the only thing that comes in up here. Maybe we can use the broadcast to talk to her. DALEY: I'll see what I can do. [AIR HISSING] MAN: Roger, Eagle One, they are in position. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Mr. President? We may have found a way to talk to Jess. Chopper's approaching, and the rest of the area is clear. 7:50. They'll be right on time. DALEY: Alex, the channel's open. Go ahead. ALEX: Jess, can you hear me? It's Alex. Don't look for me. I can see you. MAN: Go ahead, Sir. Honey, it's Daddy. You hang in there, sweetie. We're gonna get you home. Just do what Alex says. [RADIO CLICKS] Are they letting you take bathroom breaks? Good. Good. I want you to tell them that you have to go to the bathroom. And then I want you to walk straight ahead and to your left. I'm behind the rocks. Now if I tell you to run, I want you to run and not look back. [RADIO CLICKS] I need to go to the bathroom. Hurry up. Can you untie my hands, please? That's great. You're doing great. Thank you. Where's she going? Taking a leak. ALEX: Just keep walking, Jess. Just keep walking. That's great. Don't turn around, Jess. Just keep walking. Yo, stop! Pretend you don't hear him. Just keep walking. Are you deaf? DALEY: What's going on, Alex? ALEX: One of the guys is coming after her. I can take him out. DALEY: Can you get the other two? ALEX: No, but I can hold ground until you get here. DALEY: Chopper's not close enough. ALEX: Just keep walking, Jess. DALEY: You need to get all three. It's too risky otherwise. Wait for the chopper. ALEX: Keep walking, Jess. Just don't look back. Keep walking, Jess. I'm gonna take the shot then cover her. No, you're not. Hold your fire. That's an order. Listen to me. ALEX: Keep walking, Jess. I said, are you deaf? ALEX: He's got her. I'm sick of these things. Move. Come on, it's time. Damn you, Daley. [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] DIRK: I have a visual. He's got an agent with him. Keep an eye on the chopper. We don't want any surprises. Anyone else steps off, shoot 'em. My pleasure. [GUN COCKS] [SILENCED GUNSHOTS] DALEY: McGregor, what's your status? [WHISPERING] I'm almost in position. That's far enough! Michael Smith will be released as soon as you show us Jessica. Do it! You'll see her again in two hours. Now get lost. On your move, Alex. Alex, you're running out of time. You'll have to make your move. I can't get a good shot. If I miss, Jess is dead. BEDFORD: Make your move. Dirk, agent's on his way back to the chopper. Make sure he gets back on. Dirk? TROY: Dirk, come in? [GUN CLICKS] AGENT: Alex, make your move. Wait a minute. It's a set-up. It's a set-up! Take her out! [GUNSHOTS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [GRUNTS] Get down, Jess! [GRUNTS] Eric! [JESS SCREAMING] [GUNSHOTS] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTING] Go! Go! Get behind me! [AIR HISSING] You gotta jump. On the count of three, you're gonna jump. I can't. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. You can do it. You'll be ok. ALEX: One, two, three, go! Jess! [COUGHS] JESS: Ah... [JESS COUGHING] Get her in! Get her in! ALEX: Get Daley! Daley! Come on! Daley! Daley! Go! Go! Go. No. That's an order, McGregor. No. I'm not doing it by the book. Alex, he's coming! I've got to steer from the back. Aah! Aah! Unh! He's catching up to us! [GRUNTING] Jess, get down with Daley. [GRUNTING] How much further do they go? The end is just ahead. But first we have to make it through Hell's Half Mile. I don't want you to paddle. Just hold on. [GRUNTS] Hold on! [GRUNTS] [GUNSHOT] Alex! JESS: Alex! Jess, get Daley! Breathe, damn you, breathe. No way, not after all this. Breathe! Breathe! [COUGHS] I owe you a dance, remember? [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] [♪♪♪] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Daddy. [CRYING] Thank you. He was a good agent. He was a good friend. I hear you're going back to Colorado. Yeah. I've convinced Grant to take flying lessons with me. Thanks for coming in. No problem. What's this? The results of the test on the limousine, using one of the confiscated rockets. They were different. They packed fusion heads. Your instincts were right. Both you and the president would have been dead. I'm not proud of the fact that I let something personal get in the way of you being a good agent. You were moving up fast for a reason that's become clear to me. Please accept my apology. I do. Taking this bullet pulled me off the presidential detail sooner than I would have hoped. I'm sorry. I've made my recommendations. They agree. You start as soon as you get back. I'll do my best. I know you will. Oh, by the way, the president sends his regards. He's spending an extra day at Camp David. Really? Did he say why? A little extra R and R. [TIRES SQUEAL, JESS GIGGLING] PRESIDENT: Watch where you're going! JESS: Dad, would you just relax? PRESIDENT: Sweetie, you need to keep both hands on the wheel. Easy. Easy on the brakes. JESS: You're really sweating, Dad. Are you ok? PRESIDENT: Sweetheart, you have to listen to me now. I know what I'm talking about. I'm the president. [JESS GIGGLES] [♪♪♪]
