What are you two doing here? Where is Jai? Where is he? I don't know. Get in the car. We have a class on thermodynamics today. There's a traffic jam in Jamnagar. And then a test on Kinematics.

Cigarette smoking is injurious to health. Ronak, your head's among the clouds these days. Careful, or it will crash land. Where is Jai? I heard he's been making cooking videos. Uncle, cooking is an art. When you see a beautiful painting, you can hear a thousand claps. Shut your nonsense. I just met an astrologer. He said that he won't start earning until he doesn't get married. He'll keep bumbling everywhere. We'll get him married as soon as college is over. Tell him. Understood? Yes.

Where one can get every type of food. What say? Sir.. Thank you. Have you heard about food trucks? Food truck. The investment is low. Opening a restaurant in one spot can be risky. Heavy rents, maintenance, competition, etcetera. And there's no guarantee if it will be a success. So food truck. Interesting. It's already a booming business in the US. There's really no hard work. Buy a truck, modify it, set up a kitchen.. ..and your food truck's ready for business. Get an impressive menu, a good chef, that's it. It's definitely scalable. Superb idea! Avni, let's do this. I'll go to Delhi and arrange for the money. And even tell Dad about you. So you won't be here for my birthday. Of course, I will. I will definitely be there. And you know what. We'll launch the food truck on your birthday. My birthday gift to you. I have a surprise for you too. Surprise! Then I will have to come back early. I will miss you. Take care. Let's go, boys. Surprise and all is okay, but how will you arrange the money? Are you out of your mind? 3 months ago you demanded One million to apply at the Australian University. I said fine, I'll arrange for it. After that.. ..she demanded another 100,000 rupees to appear for some entrance exam.. ..which I gave her immediately. Now she wants another million for this food truck. Have you lost your mind, Avni? Right. I am out of my mind whenever I want money. Otherwise, I am a genius. I am not asking for a favor. Break the FD which grandpa saved up for me. I will return it with interest. I promise. See.. She's lost her mind since she got into MBA. She's lecturing me on principle and interest. Take it. It's your money after all. Do what you want. Here's the money. Get the keys and the RC book. Hello. How are you? And where are you? I am..fine. Why didn't you call for two days? Any other girl would have called you a dozen times by now. What's up? Nothing much. Hey Delhi boy, if you want your surprise then come back soon. Did you speak with Varun? Yeah. He's showing attitude. He's asking for 100,000 a month. 100,000! What surprise was Shravanti talking about? Nothing. She keeps uttering nonsense, you know. Why do you sound so dull? All okay? Yeah.. ..it's just stress about starting this business.. Don't worry about it. Everything will be fine. We'll find a chef as well. It will all work out. It has to work out. What a brilliant idea. Restaurant on Wheels. Nice name. I wish I had such good ideas.. Why? Even your ideas are unique. Cooking videos. Zero investment, easy money. What easy money? Why? Didn't you get your cheque from youtube? I did. Congratulations.

Couldn't you send a location map? Or just pick up your phone and call, dammit. Hello. Oh..hello. Please, come. Please, come. Hello. I'm so sorry. That broker is the one who created this confusion. Doesn't matter. Come in. Hello. Hello. Hello. Please. This is lane no. 7. Correct. Correct. I was just confirming. Please, help yourselves. Hurry up, Avni. What are you doing? Are they in the right place? They the right people, at the right place. Now hurry up, or the coffee will turn cold. Come soon, okay. Keep a smiling face. Okay.. I'll speak frankly. I know your son doesn't have a job, nor qualification. But, that's okay. Even my daughter is not too keen on studies. Generation gap, I guess. I am just looking for a good boy, from a good family. With good values. I believe in astrology because it's a science. And your son's birth-chart matches perfectly with my daughter's. My Avni is a very homely girl. Sweet and shy. Look, didn't I tell you. Are you interested in cooking? Yes, of course.. I am sorry, but I am not interested in getting married. I want to go to Australia for further studies. Thank you and.. Sorry for wasting your time. So, mister, we will discuss this amongst ourselves, and.. Yes, of course. Please take your time. But, what about the money? It's okay. I appreciate your frankness. Whatever I own belongs to my daughter.. Uncle, I accept this proposal. Can I meet my future wife? Of course, why not. Krupal. Hi. Nice dress. I don't know whether you like me or not. And I know these arranged marriage meetings can be a little weird. Hey Romeo.. your Juliet is standing there! She is the maid here. The tea was too sweet. You should put less sugar. Are you going to dry the clothes in the bucket only or hang them out to dry. Hi, Richa. Nice dog. Careful, it bites. Hey listen, why don't you guys go out? Grab some lunch some day. I'll arrange for something. It's important to get to know each other. Of course, uncle. See you. See you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hey, what do you do? Looks like a foreign breed. But you should iron out his wrinkles. Papa, do you have the address of that family, who came here by mistake? Why? Do you want to tell them personally that.. .. ♪ I don't want to get married, my father's forcing me. I want to go to Australia, etcetera-etcetera ♪ . Very funny. Let it be now. Stop taunting my daughter. Where are you going? To arrange money for Australia. Take a rickshaw, it's hot outside. Stop showing this concern. Doesn't suit you. I am taking the scooter. See..wasn't she taunting me? What are you doing? Look where you're going. Jai. I was coming to meet you. Me? I want to talk to you. But you.. Avni. You know, after you left I got an idea. We both need money. I have a food truck, a business plan, and you want to be a chef. I still remember the taste of that cottage cheese steak you made. So I was thinking.. ..why don't we start this food truck business in partnership. It's a nice idea, Avni, but I don't need to work anymore. I am settling down. My marriage has been fixed. Ohh.. Congrats. Do you like the girl? I am going to meet her today. Her dad fixed a lunch date today. And, what if you don't like the girl? Then I'll adjust. The problem here is money. Once I have the money, there is no problem. Can I give you an advice, for free? What you're doing is wrong. Getting married for the sake of money. I don't know.. And let's assume that they hand over their business to you. And what if you don't like it? There are three kinds of people in this world, Avni. One that's built for the job. Second for business and that third who do nothing. I am the third type. And I know that pretty well. And you can find a better chef. Find someone good. Why me? In case you change your mind. My number. Sorry, pick it up yourself. I am getting late. Hi, Richa. Hi. Nice place, huh. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon. Thank you. Thank you. So.. ..what do you do in your free time? Nothing. You? Cooking. I love cooking. Nice. Just one moment, please. If you didn't want to talk, then why call me here? Not me, dad wanted to talk. What? Your dad here? What's up, guys? How are you? No-no-no, sit. Relax. I was in a board meeting downstairs and thought I'll meet you again. How's everything? Good, sir. Getting to know each other? Yes. You guys haven't ordered anything? No. Then order something quickly. Because I am hungry. Sir, what would you like to have? I'll come straight to the point. Frankly speaking, I want someone to take care of my business. But do you have any experience in the business? I understand education and all that is very important. But that's not everything. Who knows where's the next billionaire is coming from. Right. Absolutely right, sir. So, do you have what it takes to become a billionaire? Because this marriage will be confirmed when.. ..I am assured that you have that talent. Come, tell me a little bit about your work experience. Food.. Food truck. Food truck? Yeah. Low investment, high returns. Take this restaurant for instance. High maintenance, staff, air-conditioning, etcetera. But food truck is like a kitchen on wheels. They call it the street-food revolution. Interesting. What do you think, Richa? Dad, please don't involve me. Carry on, Vijay. I am listening. It's Jai, sir. Jai. I am sorry. Do continue. So what I was saying is.. ..me and my friend Avni are going to start this food truck business together. Haven't you started yet? It's done, sir. It's already on. We're going to launch in 2 months. Then once your Food Truck's launched, then we'll meet. And talk about this marriage proposal. For now, let's eat something. I am starving. What will you guys have? It's a huge vehicle. Wiring, painting.. It will cost you around 500,000 rupees. It's a lot of work. I already told you I don't have that kind of budget. Look, sister. You've been saying this for the last two hours. Does it sound nice? You won't find anyone who will work in your budget? I just did. You both leave. What? Nonsense.. Jai. You, here? I thought about your offer. What offer? The food truck business. Come on, let's do it. That offer is closed now. I've hired two great cooks. I also paid them in to advance. Those two who just left? Yeah. They look more like mechanics. They cook with their hands, not their face. But they can't cook like me. You even tasted my food. Sorry. And you're not the hard-working type, are you? Avni. I am hardworking, at least give me a chance. Why this sudden change? Sorry, but there's a twist in the situation. My rich and frank father-in-law wants me to prove myself before the wedding. Ohh.. Why didn't you tell him there are three kinds of people in this world? Job, business, and those who don't do anything. Okay, I get it. Sorry. Not like this, say it thrice. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. And hold your ears. Now you're.. Or else the offer's closed. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Much better. First I want you to modify the truck. Why me? I am a chef, not a mechanic. Mechanics are too expensive. So modifying the truck is your responsibility. And I will take care of the registration and other paperwork. Great. You will sit here in the office and work, while I will work out in the sun. No one's forcing you. You can do it if you want, or just tell your father-in-law the truth. Okay, I get it. Good. Then, I'll call you when the time is right. And, bring your friends along too. They will give you a hand. Okay. Thank you. My pen. ..understand. But will you get it done on time? Okay. Yeah, bye. Hi. Hi. Hi, I am Ronak. No need to waste time with introductions. I already know you guys. Look, I am very punctual. And I expect you guys will respect that. And never be late for work. You'll have to always finish your work on time. The food has to be cooked on time. Success comes to those who are punctual. But you guys.. What? You guys don't look like someone who values time. Am I right? Hello. Ronak. Do you follow time? Time. You see, I was born before time. Premature baby. I leave home before dad gets up in the morning. I finish an hour's workout in 40 minutes. And always reach at 7.45 pm for a nine o' clock show. I never made any girl wait on a date. I am sure you must have noticed in my words. Ronak means Time. Time means Ronak. Impressive. I had put aside 6 days for the truck's modification. But looking at Ronak's dedication, I think 4 days are enough. The instructions are in this folder. Read them carefully and follow them. And I will pay you guys only if I like your work. And what if you don't? Then you will pay fine for wasting my time. Good luck. Humiliating. How are we going to do it?

Of course, we will. Why are you so tensed? Bro, don't underestimate Avni. If anything goes wrong tomorrow, she won't spare us. Your frank father-in-law is scarier than Avni. You know I'll be frank with you, Vijay. I am into astrology. It's a science. He imitated him exactly na? We've to earn a lot of money. And prove to my father-in-law.

Where were you? The food's ready. Just give me five minutes. Do what you have to. Just make it fast. Come on. Hello, sir. Hello, ma'am. Hello. You both are like made for each other. Thank you so much. God Bless you. Thank you so much. We've made special starters. Especially for today. Please have it. Sure. Please tell us how they taste. Dad. Dad, please taste this. Quickly. Mushroom. Cottage cheese. I told you to be on time. This is so unprofessional. Sorry. But everything looks fine. If they don't like our food, we're jacked. The bride's father owns a restaurant. Which restaurant? Crust.. Upper Crust. Madam, sir is calling. I think they liked our food. Yes, sir. Your starters are really nice. Thank you so much, sir. We take special care in making our customized menu.. ..according to our esteemed guests. Are you ashamed of lying? Sorry, sir, I.. Shut up. You're selling my restaurant's food with your label on it. If I wanted to order food from my restaurant, I wouldn't have hired you. Don't you guys have any principles? So here's a tip for you. That dishonesty doesn't serve long. So stop being a fraud. Stupid people. You don't worry. Ups and downs are normal. But they were getting too hyper. Anyway, I am starving. Can we go get some lunch? Stop the truck. But we won't get anything out here, Avni. I said stop the truck. What.. I said stop. Stop it! Okay.. Okay.. What's wrong with the door? Whenever you try to go away from me, the door gets jammed. Relax. Get down. What's wrong, Avni? What's wrong? You're asking me what's wrong? Get down, please. Okay. Careful, Avni. Careful. Avni. I can't do this. Come on, it was our first order. Sorry Avni, it was a mistake.. Just don't speak. You have grown up only physically.. your mind is still immature like a child's. What are you saying? We met accidentally. You said its a sign. And you proposed this partnership. It was my mistake. If you don't like it.. no problem. I'll find some other way of proving myself to my father-in-law Yeah..and then take 10 million in dowry and put that money in FD. What's wrong with that? Just give me the keys. It's in the truck. It won't happen again, Avni. I mean it. It won't happen again. Promise. You drank with the diesel money too? You were right. You're good for nothing. Any girl you marry will find out the truth pretty soon and run away. Even your father wants to get rid of you.. ..which is why he's sending you away as a live-in son-in-law, but.. ..you still don't understand. You don't understand anything. One last job for you. Fill fuel in the truck and park it at the office. And you can get drunk with the remaining money.. Avni.. how will you go back? I'll call a cab. Avni! Avni! I won't give it. Give it back, Purab. I won't give it. Just for a minute. You've been watching it for so long. No. Give it back, Purab. No. Mehta. What a pleasant surprise. Rupa. Yes. He's an old colleague of mine. Hello. Hello. Come in. Come. Move, Purab. This is for you. Thank you. Give it back. Come, we'll go inside. Sit down. Tea or coffee? Hello, uncle. Are you at the wrong address again? I wanted to speak with Avni. Okay. Avni. Jai's here. Come in. Avni. Keys and rest of the money. He's Praful. He's an engineer. Are they here to see Avni for marriage? No, son. He's an old friend. You must go now, come back later. They must be on the wrong address as well. No.. I mean.. ..what is this haste for, uncle? The haste to get into college. Then the hurry to get a degree. Then the haste to get married. And have children. And then another child. Then raise them. What is this, uncle? Do you call this life? Let us breathe.. give us some time. We'll get married. But your fathers are hard to satisfy. This is the problem. You have such an intelligent daughter, but you still wish for a son. Actually, you should have had a son. Like me. Maybe then you would've realized. You would've gone crazy like my father. And you would've wished for your daughter back. If I ever have children.. ..I'll wish I have a daughter like Avni. But you..just want to see her get married. Such a waste. Look, Avni isn't interested in getting married. She wants to go to Australia for further studies. But she comes down for these meetings because her father forces her. I apologize if I said too much. Jai. Jai. That girl from the wrong address is here. She made something for us. Come down. It's really tasty. Did you get the recipe from some cooking show? Looks like a fusion of continental and North-Indian, isn't it? Am I right? But it's delicious. Why don't you teach this to Tiku as well? I know how to make it. No, you don't. Grandma. Jai, come here. And taste this. Isn't it delicious? It's really delicious. How is it, uncle? It's nice. I made this food watching Jai's recipes. Your son is very talented, uncle. And these days cooking has become a good profession. If this is what Jai wants to do, then it's a good thing. Everyone says that we should listen to our heart. If Jai focuses on this, then he can be a really good chef. He will make your proud, uncle. Jai and I are starting a food truck business. We wanted your blessings, that's all I wanted to say. Get up. Get up. I have it. I am really sorry. I blabber anything in anger. This food truck is our baby. We won't give up so easily. See you. Can you make a sweet dish? I am learning.

That's really cool. Thank you so much, uncle. We recovered our investment in just one month. We're in profits now. Wow! Congratulations. If you don't mind, can I ask you a question? Yes. What's your share in this business? Actually, uncle believes in talking frankly. So don't feel offended. That's okay. 50% uncle. As this fine gentlemen just said, I'll be frank. Avni, I have an offer for you. I want to buy out your share. I want to buy you out. You want to go to Australia for your internship program. I have some friends out there, who can help you out. And as for your ticket and accommodations, food, admission food. I will handle all that. And I will also give you an extra 2 million. What say? Jai's my future son-in-law. So, if I don't invest in his business, then who else will. I knew from Day 1 that this boy is special. I need some time, uncle. Yeah, sure. Take your time. Think about it. But please, tell me before Diwali. Because these two are getting engaged on Diwali.. ..and on the same auspicious day, we'll final this deal. Engagement? Yeah. Jai and Richa's engagement.

I don't have time to listen to your nonsense. You showed a lot of courage while proposing. So what happened while breaking up? Be a man Vikram. Coffee? Remember that Australian guy. He was studying robotics or something like that. He got a job in Melbourne. He's coming to India tomorrow. And wants to meet you. Fine. I said no. I said no to them. Due to the constant pressure from relatives to get you married.. ..I distanced you from myself. But not anymore. You can do anything you want, dear. I completely trust you. I am proud of you. Seriously. Nice coffee. Pathetic. Nice coffee. I so needed this. Tomorrow's my first show on the radio, and I've got a sore throat. I am very scared for tomorrow. Why are you two so quiet? Isn't the coffee nice? No, it's nice. So Shravanti, new bike-new job. Coffee isn't enough. Nonsense. Your food truck business is booming. You're flooded with offers, you're getting engaged. And you want a treat from me. Leave all this aside. Are you two ready for tomorrow? I can't come tomorrow. I've guests coming over to see me. This isn't right. Tomorrow is my first show on the radio. About my best friend. And you're ditching me. So unfair. If you can't make it to the studio, then can you least talk on the phone. It will only take 5 minutes. And I will handle the rest. Don't think so hard. Just 5 minutes. Okay. I'll talk. And what about you, sir? One chocolate waffle and a cold coffee. Done. Now. Too much you are. Is someone really coming over to meet you? Yes. And you're not going to say yes. He's from Australia. So this time..you never know. Even uncle gave you an offer for Australia. But, that's not enough. I want more for my 50% share. I'll negotiate. But..mostly okay. And the truck? Are you going to quit? It's just a truck! Uncle's planning on buying some bigger trucks. What? And what about this one? Covert it into ambulance, taxi, or something else. Maybe he can scrap it too. It's just a truck. Excuse me. Check, please. I met Vikram yesterday. There's a lot you haven't told me. Like you told me about your engagement. And this is about that? I swear I didn't know. Anyway. Thank you so much. Vikram came over to say sorry. Loser. Better than you. At least he has the courage to convey his feelings. Excuse me. Please don't compare me with Vikram. You two are not that different either. I have to go. It was nice meeting you. And working with you.

Come on, you can tell me frankly. Its nothing uncle.. just have some work.. A phone interview for a radio show. If you could direct me a quiet corner. Interview, that's fantastic. Of course, of course. There's a place upstairs. I'll hear it too, and make Richa listen as well. Go on. Go on. Thank you. Proud of you, Vijay. So, what do you do? I am fine, thank you. What do you do? I am a photographer, uncle. And you? I am a writer, and writing a book. Writer. Fascinating. What's the name of your book? Mind your own business. Excuse me. Mind your own business is the life story of a young businessman. Drinks? Thank you. Hello, Jai. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Okay. Hold on, I'll connect Avni on a conference call. Hello, Avni. Yeah. Are you ready? Yeah, ready. What's wrong? Why do you sound so dull? Not feeling well. Just give me five minutes. I'll try and wind up quickly. Don't be crazy. Take all the time you want. It's okay. Okay. Jai, are you there? Yeah, I am here. Here we go, guys. Good evening, Ahmedabad. I am your RJ Shravanti, and you're tuned into 93.5 RedFM. Dad, please. I won't be happy. Please! Sweetheart, try to understand. He's an amazing guy, you'll be very happy with him. Look, I am going with my gut here now. His food truck business is on the top now. Baby, he can take care of our family business. I mean that boy's got a business sense. Then why don't you make him your business partner? Why are you dumping him on me, dad? Richa. Sir. What's the matter? I hope I am not disturbing? No. My daughter's getting a little emotional. What's this? Your hands are empty. Come on. No, no, I am fine thank you. Jai's interview is coming on the radio Yes. Even we're listening. See you later. Yes. I hope there are no problems. Seriously, there is no problem. I hope you're being frank. You both met accidentally for your marriage. Later they became friends. And then became successful partners in a food truck business. Now you two are getting married.. But, hello. Not with each other. I know you guys are marrying separate people. Jai, you're there. Yeah, I am there. So, love marriage or arranged marriage? Arranged? What? No love stories. He's not too brave when it comes to love. So no love, no stories. Meaning? Don't you know? If Jai wants to propose to a girl, he has to take permission first. From his mom, dad, grandma, friends, neighbors, etcetera-etcetera. From brushing his teeth in the morning to sleeping at night. Jai has to take permission for everything. I can't believe this. Jai, do you have anything to say? He needs permission to answer this question too. Jai. You have permission to speak freely on this show. You can say whatever you want. Yeah, Avni is right. I am a coward. But Avni is very brave. She isn't scared of anyone. She doesn't have to prove herself to her father. Or scared of getting hurt. She's definitely not scared of the boys who come over to see her for marriage. She isn't scared of leaving her family and going to Australia. She is not scared of starting a business or trusting people. And I... I am scared. Since I was a kid. I get scared if the lights suddenly go out. Scared of my father's voice. Scared of school. Scared of exams. When I grew up, I was scared of responsibilities. I am even very scared of Avni. But I want to say something today, Shravanti. Even now I am scared, but I am still going to say it. Avni. We met accidentally. But when we met I felt very lucky. But later I realized that I am not fit for you. People always called me a loser. And somewhere I also started believing in that. But..you know what.. ..it was Avni who told me the first time. Jai, you are talented. You want to cook, you should cook. And today people call this loser Jai a successful businessman. They want to interview me. But I still have a fear. If Avni's not with me.. ..then I'll become a loser again. Okay, guys, we have just two minutes. Then Jai will announce his engagement.. ..and Avni will go meet her Australian fiance. You two will part ways. So do you two want to say anything to each other in these last two minutes? Jai, say it. Say it. Say it. Avni.. I just want to tell you that.. Will you fill diesel every day? I will. Tyre pressure. I'll check it every day. Time? I'll wake up on time, eat on time, office on time. Jai means time. Time means Jai. I don't know how you'll do it, but.. ..you better be outside my house before I come down. And yes.. ..this time come on the right address. ♪ Threads of love are slowly pulling.. ♪ Teasing my heart.. ♪ ♪ After the message I got today.. ♪ ♪ ..no one can stop me now. ♪ ♪ Threads of love are slowly pulling.. ♪ Teasing my heart.. ♪ ♪ After the message I got today.. ♪ ♪ ..no one can stop me now. ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ ♪ I am covered in the red color of dawn. ♪ ♪ My heart is racing towards you Leaving everything behind. ♪ ♪ With you.. ♪ ♪ ..these moments, my beloved. ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ ♪ My beloved is here ♪ 'Hail Goddess..'
