Shintoho Company I'll go at my own pace. Do you lead happy lives? What do you eat? Do you listen to music? Are you constipated? Do you have sex? Are you perverted? Do you love each other? You're violating the traffic regulations. Halley's Comet crashed into the Earth... I'll write about it this way. Full stop. "Magical Pirate Tour". 'Pirate'? Marino Fujisawa BRAINSEX Were your father and mother really doing such a thing at home? You don't have to believe it. In reality, wasn't it just a desire in your head, Chisa? What's that? An abnormal desire. I often imagine those things. Please tie me up! Please whip me. Please torture me. That's called 'masochism'. Kazuko, you always bring a dictionary with you? Let me consult it. No, I won't. Give back my dictionary! Don't disturb me! That's it! 'Fetish'... "A divine object. A piece of wood or a stone that primitive people worshipped." Then my father is a primitive man, and my mother a piece of wood or a stone. What are you talking about? He was licking a high-heeled shoe. That may be... 'fetishism'. "The worship of a fetish..." Ah, that's it. "A sexually perverted attachment to an object." You're talking about yourself. You always look at your CDs with worship. Because they glitter beautifully. I want to listen to 'Hikaru Genji', so can you give back my CD player? 'Abnormal Glasses'? You're looking down on it? Then what do you listen to? Bach. I'm an idiot. I see. Our class starts soon. Were you listening to the radio last night? Yes. Wasn't there an odd interference? I didn't notice it. Frequencies Handbook "Magical Pirate Tour". Here it comes. The city is disappearing... Disappearing... The Noise Detectives' Association Hey! Wait! Please! What is "The Noise Detectives' Association"? Don't spy on me... I guess the source of the radio wave interference is 'Pirate', and I'm looking for it. Please let me join you. - Please! - No. The association has only one member? That's not natural. - It's all right. - Wait. Help! This is ABCD. Hello! This is ABCDEFG, Pirate with Jumping Jump. Stay with me until the end. The odd man isn't here tonight, so I, a cute girl, will talk to the end. Drop dead if you're not happy with me! My friend was raped in that way. Rape or violation is really fearful. It's already time to finish. See you next week, on the same wavelength. Bye-bye! The next time will be more exciting. This was ABCD Daywatch. Goodnight, at midnight. When I arrived at the site, her clothes had been torn off by the rapist, and her breasts were strangely deformed. But to my shame, they were larger than mine. When they were grasped more tightly, Kazuko let out an odd noise. I was afraid, but she may have been feeling good... What on Earth is this? - Maybe 'Pirate'. - I wasn't raped. All this is a lie. You must know my nickname is 'the liar Chisa'. But a lot of people were listening. You shouldn't have mentioned my name. How stupid you are! Facts aren't interesting at all. What will they think of me? I don't know. - That's your business. - They're talking about me in class. Here it is. "In fact, it's lies that have built the world," so said Professor Sakamoto, of Japanese History. It hurts. Are you satisfied? Our business was also finished: your friend leaves. This is Jumping Jump. He's high-jacking my pirate station... An emergent broadcast, live from the Jumping Jump studio! Jumping Jump is now peeping... into a room, where there is a woman and a young guy. Are they arguing? Guy: Don't you want me tonight? Woman: You shouldn't have come today only because you came yesterday. Guy: You actually want me. Woman: You aren't the only man. Takeshi is going to come. This isn't good. The guy got mad, and he's tearing off her stockings. She's resisting... and resisting. But she can't match him. This isn't good. This is nearly a rape. Oh! He picks up a vase... he throws it at her. It hits her. He's looking for a weapon. He grips a knife, a real one! He'll stab her. Danger! He'll stab her. Stab! Stab! Death to her! He holds the knife aloft. Stab! Oh, her blood is splashing! A sea of blood around her! He scoops out her insides. He slashes her, and stabs her. He scoops out her insides. Blood! Blood! Red blood! He continues stabbing her. She's already unconscious. Stab! Keep stabbing her! Stab more! Deliver the fatal stab! Set me free! I expected you would come back. I want to do pirate radio. Come in. I won't hurt you. You're good at talking. I belong to the broadcasting club. Man, why do you do this? "Man"? The equipment was left in the studio of this closed-down school. I adjusted it a bit. Magical Pirate... Tour. Shall we go on a Pirate tour? Is pirate radio interesting? I have nothing else to do. I can get by on my retirement money. Every day is too long to me. I'm apathetic... - But when I do pirate radio... - You get concentrated? Maybe. Like this closed-down school, Tokyo might decay, little by little. It's not pleasant to see my home town going to ruin. Are you doing a campaign? You aren't? Perhaps I am. "Don't devastate our Tokyo!" I'll somehow be happy, if it gradually gets dirtier and if war changes it to a complete ruin one day. Like in science fiction. And only I will survive, within a shelter. Then I'll get out of it with my CDs. I'll have nothing to do, so I'll throw them, like Frisbees. A dog will follow them and bring them back. Then I'll listen to them silently. A cat may be better? No. A dog. A cat won't follow them. If it follows, it won't come back. Is she masturbating? A vibrator slowly... Ah! It's a snake! She's feeling good. The snake is... licking her. But if it bites her, that will hurt. No, that doesn't hurt, but gives pleasure. Oh, no! She moves it down there. With a Mamushi... it's sensitive... down there. What if it bites you? She looks ecstatic. She's feeling so good. She's feeling good. Her fingers touch her clitoris. Lick it, please. I can't bear it any more. Lick my clitoris too, please. Good! Another exclusive live broadcast by Jumping Jump! Oh, the woman's clothes were torn off. He's squeezing her breasts. He holds a knife. Blood! It's red. Red! Do it quickly! She shouts "Stop!", and tries to run away... But her eyes are pleading with the man to stab her. She's a masochist. I'll stab you! I'll stab you! My gums don't bleed, but my body does. The Pirate radio... is publicising murders. That apple was delicious. What do you want? 'Murder Line' pleased you? Ah, it was you. Yes, it was me. I'm Jun Morita. So what? I'll be the next one? I'm not interested in murdering you. You need a charming announcer? Don't joke! You're a killer D.J. I'm Jumping Jump! I'll borrow it. Did you appreciate my sense of copywriting? You're not a killer D.J., but a killer J.J. Are you abnormal? Yes, in the sense that I'm not ordinary. I'm above the normal standard. I'm at a higher level. Abnormal... Anyway, I'll go. I was surprised at first. You intended it yourself. I was provoked by Pirate. Don't joke! I heard she was an office worker at an eminent firm. - Your relationship was in trouble. - What's that? For that reason, you murdered her. But if you insist you were encouraged, your punishment will be milder. Why do I have to murder an ordinary office lady? She may not have been ordinary. She was leading a double life, working at a cabaret. That isn't rare. You're doing the same. You go to school, eat and drink, but on the other hand you do pirate radio. Besides, you have another self that doesn't know what it's doing or thinking. You're leading a triple life. Just reasoning... That self of yours, which doesn't know what it's doing or thinking, commits murders? You're good at philosophy. This is psychology. How about continuing 'Murder Line' live? It was delicious. Hello. Hello. Will you try? How did you get my number? You should prepare well before starting something. You should gather information... data. Isn't she your friend? She was, until a while ago. She's bothering me. She always follows me about. I see... Is she your type? Shall we go on a tour to her? A live tour, with the man and the Pirate equipment involved. You also watch your own house? Of course. I'm most in danger. The terminus of the tour will be my house. Now it's time. Go to the Pirate studio. Will the man and Kazuko definitely come to your room? I told her to bring him to my room and have sex with him. I also told her that if she did well, she could join us. That should work with her. Come this way. No. Ah, no... I'll take them off myself. There's no one around. Do it harder! This was Jumping Jump. You were serious. This city will fall into a panic. Are you satisfied? They'll all be afraid that they might be the next victim. And they'll become incapable of sleeping. "Incapable of sleeping"... Home becomes farther and farther away. Go back along the way you've just come. - You'd better go home. - After you. I've moved here. You're going to live with the man? To live alone. He's always out. I can live with you. Is it safe? Will you produce Jumping Jump's end? I said I wouldn't kill you. I don't give any interviews. - I want you to, at any cost. - Don't speak like TV staff. I am TV. So, you aren't human? I'll document your crime. Then I'll diffuse it, via an illegal broadcast. You're trying to deceive a liar. You liar! You're going to sneak a shot? Of course, I'll hide your faces. That's not the point. - I'll give you the fees. - How much? I don't want to make my life public. - Can I use the audio tape you recorded? - No! I've collected my favourite sounds, so that I can be as if in my room everywhere. An enclosed room that moves? Does it make you commit murders? It's my life, the same as the tape you're making. Erase it, quickly. No. Give it to me. I want to see it. Think it over. I won't, probably. How about setting off on a tour with us? We'll do a lot of live performances. Requests for other things than live are also welcome. What do you think of the recent phantom killer incident? Excuse me. About the phantom killer... Excuse me. Your opinion about the phantom killer incident? About the phantom killer incident... Someone has fallen over... Hello. He doesn't move. He's bleeding. He looks injured. Hello. Ah... He doesn't move... Excuse me. What happened? Excuse me. Tell me. Excuse me. What happened to him? Excuse me. Tell me what happened. Excuse me. What happened to him? Excuse me. I want to know about him. What happened? He's bleeding. This was Jumping Jump, on the spot. Radical Hysteria Tour Troupe Excuse me. Do you want to have sex with me before a picnic? Have what? Sex. I don't have sex with my colleague. That's also OK. Hello! This is Radical Hysteria Tour...
