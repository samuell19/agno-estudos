BAD ROADS - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Stop the engine please. - Ah, yep. Your ID please. Just a moment... Here. - Halyna Serhiyivna? - Meaning? You're Halyna S. Onyshchuk, born 1975, right? Gosh... It's my wife's. Maybe, you have her husband's ID? Damn... Any problems? Well, I... I don't understand... I... took it from the fridge in the morning. I thought it was my passport. - Get out of the car please. - Well... Damn... Maybe... I'll call my wife, eh? She'll confirm. - Do you have your driver's license? - I keep... ... my license in the passport. - There's none here. - Sure there isn't. It's Halia's passport. May I call my wife please? I'll give you the phone, and she'll confirm. Commander? - We've got a driver with no ID. - Do pick up... - Put down the phone please. - Commander, please... - She's at work... - Put down the phone. She's at an afternoon shift at the hospital. Please... Put your hands on the wheel. My goodness... I took the passport from the fridge, I thought it was mine, but... it turned out to be Halia's... O my... Maybe, we'll still call her? She's at work today... She'd... ... confirm... Afternoon. Where's Halyna Serhiyivna? She's at work, at the afternoon shift. At the hospital. He says he's confused the passports. They were on the fridge... - Get out of the car. - I took... Please... - Get out! - Ooh... Commander... It's really... He's juiced. I'm a friend. I'm from Popasna. I'm from Zhytomyr. What now? Well... What're you going to do with me? What do you think we should do? You're juiced, no ID, crossing the checkpoint into the NATO area. What are we gonna do with you? Your guys and I had a celebration... Our school won in a competition and the military... - Which "our school"? - School 3! - Over there, behind the... - No waving arms! Hands behind your back! Face the car! Now! I'm the headmaster... Everyone knows me here. You can ask anyone of the locals. You see, headmaster, there's a trifle invented... called a passport... What... It's issued to everyone when they turn 16, in order to be properly identified. A normal guy in the war time, won't ever go out even to take a crap without his passport, not to mention of driving around the area. How did you get out of this sector without your passport? - Out there? - Are you deaf? Well, when I crossed out I had it with me... - And?.. - Fuck... This means I took both, my wife's and mine. Maybe, it's somewhere in the car, eh? It's called contradictory testimony. Open up the trunk. - Well, shall I stand still or open it up? - Go open it up! - Here... - What do you have in there? Well... The kettles... for the kids in the Junior School, to drink tea. It's canned meat. The military gave it to us. - What else? - Well, it's the... Well... sanitary ware stuff, to mend toilet bowls and pipes. It's a guitar. We sang songs with the soldiers after... - What's behind the guitar? - Well.. I'm saying we sang songs... What's behind the guitar? Behind the guitar... Well... Fuck, weapons! On the floor!! On the floor! Now! Guys, please... You won't believe, or going to laugh, but it's a dummy! What?! It's a dummy, given as a gift for the kids. Which kids? My kids, at the school. Senior students. - A dummy? - What dummy? It's a Kalashnikov! Well... It's the men from your unit... gave it as a gift to the kids after the competition! Are you saying our army arms children? For the lessons... in military education. It's a dummy for training. Just call Major Kostenko, he'll explain everything. We have no major with this name in our unit. How no? You're the... the National Guard, right? Nope. We are the Sherstiuk Battalion. You don't know Major Kostenko, do you? - He's bald, a finger missing on his hand. - Zip it up for a while. What are we going to do? I'm calling central command. This school principal is going to prison. You'll sober up in a moment in the company of our rats. National Security will come to investigate. I've got classes in the morning. May I call my wife at least, eh? Please... Hallo, Sanych? We've stopped a tipsy one. On the wheels, with no ID. He says he's the headmaster of a school. - D'you know Major Kostenko?! - He refers to some Kostenko. Who the hell do you fight for?! Halt! What? He's bald... a finger missing... Who's got a finger missing? Nobody. Who do we fight for here? Okay, guys... Take me to prison... and do to me whatever you want. I'm guilty. Only, please allow me to phone my wife. Well, we don't fight here. Is it fighting really? We just sunbathe here, taking the sun and bullets from snipers. I'm here with a heart valve, between my home and Mordor, and I don't want my daughter to hide in fucking cellars as your children do. I'm here to prevent tipsy headmasters from carrying Kalashnikovs in their trunk. For such headmasters as you to be kept away from children at all. No one knows what you teach them, which homeland to love. Did you pin this flag up before the checkpoint, or do you drive with it everywhere? I've sobered up... I mean it. "What the fuck do we fight for here..." Which school? We've got a good school. School 3. We make masking nets for you. Yeah, we did take them from the gym teacher. Aleksandr Ivanovich? He's grey. Yes, he's grey. National Security will come to understand what you make and who for. So, the last name? Parkhomenko... Aleskandr Ivanovich. He's grey. Ah, my name... Onyshchuk Ihor Volodymyrovych. Two thousand... Oh, Liudka... - Liudka Marchenko. - What? The girl, she's just peeked out of the dug-out. She's my student in Class 8-A Liuda! Liuda! She'll confirm I'm the headmaster. Liuda! Hid out. What the fuck is she doing here? Her homework, what else? We've got schoolgirls in every dug-out here. You've drunk too much. I did see Liudka. Fuck... Was she alone or with other girls? I don't know. May I have some water? So? Let him go home to sleep himself sober. Or he'll have jumps right here. No, fucking thanks. Look here, headmaster. Tomorrow you come here with your ID. If you don't come, we'll find you even at the end of the earth. Guys... Letting me go, right? You sure? He'll come here tomorrow, will you? I will. I keep the passport. Get the Kalashnikov from his trunk. We'll check its number. Do call Major Kostenko. He'll explain. Get lost. I'll drive slow. Glory to Ukraine! Just go. Why did you let him go? He had a Kalashnikov... It's a dummy. A dummy? It looks like a real one. 'Cause it was a real one. Dummies for schools are made from real ones. You had military education lessons at school, hadn't you? No, I hadn't. I followed at an advanced French course. Fuck... now I see why our army is what it is. - It's a good army. - Hallo? Hallo, Sanych? Yeah, all clear. We've sorted it out. A bald one? Yep, a finger missing. Yep. Over. See its barrel's dissected? I do. A fucking good army. Bring it here. When at school, I was No. 1 in disassembling and assembling guns. And? "And?" Keep the time. Did you eat frogs at your French school? No, I didn't. And I did. Done! 10 seconds. Not bad. - Assembling? - Yep. Meanwhile, sing something in French for me. - Okay. - A-a-a-and... Go! Over there. He's coming back. I've found my passport. In the car, on the floor. Dropped out. Good boy. Go. What? Here. Here. For the kids. She's an orphan. Lives with her granny. Who? Liudka. What damned Liudka? Marchenko. Did you take anything else along with alcohol? Drugs? Damn, commander... Is a sin... I know, teens like her are different... But please, don't touch this one. You see... Her mother died. She lives with her granny... Do you know what that is like? They couldn't leave because of shelling. They spent months in the cellar. Yes, she... smokes, neglects her schoolwork, but she's no whore. You want to drive me stark raving mad, don't you? Who the fuck do you think I am? Well... Just... let her go with me. I'll keep mum. I'll just take her home and that's it. Just between us boys... You fucked up? I've got a wife and a daughter. It's you who're fucked up! What are you doing to us? We want to believe you. They shelled us, you fuck our children... I'll... smash your mug now. I give you my word as an officer: She isn't here. You don't believe officer's word? Come. You'll see. Come. I saw somebody out there... I've got two soldiers there, sleeping after the duty. And a goose. That was no goose. You don't believe me. An officer's word? An officer's word. Forgive me, commander. I'm sorry. Imagination... It's nerves. This one has sort of a harder texture. - It's darker, right? - Yep. Here... - A light one. Yep, it's nice... - Not bad. And what about this one? Can't tell. That's a cool lipstick. I want this one too. I've got it already. Adam gave me one. Nope, yours is a different shade. I left it home. I'll show you some other time. Bison gave me a shampoo and a conditioner. Feel my hair. - Yeah, it's silky-smooth. - It was like straw after it was dyed. I even thought I'd cut it short. But now it's OK now. What did yours get you, kid? These. The seeds. - The seeds? - Yep. That doesn't count. He just treated you with the seeds. I mean a gift. Don't be upset. He'll give you one some other day. Just ask him. He's no miser, is he? If he hasn't given you a gift yet, then he never will. He's no miser. He gave a bag of cabbages and a bucketful of beets to Uncle Kolia. Where does Uncle Kolia come in? Where does Uncle Kolia come in here? Is he Uncle Kolia's boyfriend? Nope. It's just he's no miser. No, no miser at all. He gave her just seeds... And gives gifts to Uncle Kolia... - Beets, seeds... - And cabbages... Look, maybe they've got... er... - Romance? - Ah, damn right... Fuck, I'm dying for a smoke... Go bum a cig, will you? Come on, they won't give it to her. - Then you go. - Nope. Bison'll beat me up. Don't talk shit. It's two seconds away. No. I had enough the last time. Just two seconds. He won't find out. I won't go. Fuck, she refused and you do too, eh? You wouldn't shit me. Do go and bum. Hey... Fuck! Should I go alone? Shit. Okay. Watch her. She'll be back with cigs now. - Want some? - Yep. Thanks. - Smooth, isn't it? - Yeah. It was like a straw after I dyed it. I've got the same thing. Ask Mars. Let him give it to you. The same one. Hey? What is it? You're strange... Oh, she's coming. "A gram of nicotine kills a horse." A penny pincher indeed! I'm getting shit at my school. I'm fed up. - At everyone's. - I mean my mates bullying me. Calling me slut and Ukrop-shagger. - It's true, isn't it? - You idiot! I told 'em Bison'd beat 'em up. They calmed down right away. But, no one wants to smoke with me since. And don't let me to copy their school work anymore. - How did they come to know? - Someone's ratted. Some bitch. Fuck, it's Krava! She's constantly poking around. She needs a good thrashing after school. Damn shit! Let's do it. I've been itching to for a while. Let's put her head in the shithouse bowl. Yeah. And wash the floor with it after. - And throw chlorine powder on her. - And close the seat lid on top. That will shame her all over the school! And who's gonna be on guard? We'll invite a third one. - Kid, are you in? - I can't. Why not? We stood up for you when Krol was beating you. - Yes, we did. - I won't come to school tomorrow. - And the day after tomorrow? - We'll see. You're being snotty. When Krol was beating you, you were asking us to help. I didn't ask. You didn't? No, you didn't. You're just lying like a piece of shit... - What was she screaming about? - "He's no Nazi! He's no Nazi!" Shit on you! I didn't ask! Guys, want some gum? I've got one you two could share. - You cunt! - Hey, calm down. - Are you nuts? - C'mon, don't touch her. What got into you? We were having a good time. - Fucking good indeed. - We are home. I thought I was going mad during the evacuation. It was good to be at the seaside, but really hard on me. Nope. When I got back, I walked around town and heard distant gunfire. And I felt so good: I was home. And I met Bison that very day. A great story indeed! Have a better one? Maybe, you can share it with us? Ah! That's your man, Bison over there. Okay, guys, I'm off. Don't kill one another. - Beware of getting knocked up. - Idiot! They shun her and not for nothing. Bison's not her first mate. She's not with him for love. And you're in it for love, are you? Meaning? Of course, I am. It's like a fairy tale with us. About Juliet. All against us, and we're against all. By the way, Adam's my first one. And you? Have you kissed? Come on, tell me. Have you kissed? Hey, I'm talking to you. You haven't even kissed! Shame indeed. Then what do you do together? I'm talking to you. Whatever. If you wish to remain a virgin, you can do it in the mouth and in the butt. But it hurts. You deaf and dumb? Nope. Just don't want to talk about such things. We're friends, aren't we? We're supposed to share. - Or else how can you learn the truth? - I'll ask someone. Okay... Wanna know what Adam said about your Mars? I don't. - You do need to know this. - I'll ask when I'm ready, got it? Why so aggressive? You'll always be a loner. I'm sick of you. Who do you think you are? What are you doing here? A piece of heavenly queen. Fucking queen indeed. Is that yours? Here, a gift. - Your Mars is a gay. - Fuck off. Gimme some seeds. So? - It's late, let's go home. - What's in there? A TV. "Let's Get Married" will be on. - Don't want to. - Why not? You've missed three episodes now. I don't want to watch Russian TV. - We can watch a different channel. - We have no other ones. You can play a DVD. Don't want to. You go and watch. I'm not going anywhere. I promised to your mom that I'd lead you... To what? Until you're adult. To the madhouse you'll lead me. Just go home. I'm the only one you have. I know. - No one wants you but me. - No one wants you. Me either. Gimme more seeds. He doesn't want you. This store wasn't here before. There was just a bench. We, the girls used to sit here waiting for our boys to return from work. Our aces were coming home from the mines. Things have changed now. He'll just mock at you and leave. Nana, go home. I don't want to right now. You got your classes tomorrow. The first is P.T. I'll go for the second. How long are you going to be sitting here? He won't come. Of course, he won't if you, the ugly one, stays here. - Is he afraid to meet me? - He's afraid of nothing. - 'Cause he's a Nazi. - He's no Nazi. They'll make mincemeat of us when they retreat. Nana, you're too old to be mincemeat. I'm not worried about myself. Then why haven't they made it of us yet? 'Cause they earn big salaries here. They won't retreat. Do go home. - Let me braid your hair. - Just piss off! I won't introduce you when he comes, will say I don't know you. And you won't say you know me. How's that? I do know you. Since you were a baby. When Lena's delivering you, I was sitting near the door and praying. I was praying when you were dying of cough... and the soups... You're hanging out in the evenings, and I'm praying for you. Don't pray for me. You were praying for Mom and she died. Everyone you're praying for died. Don't pray for me. - Jesus... - Damn! I'll go to the military police. And say he raped you. And seduced you. And he'll be put in prison for life. And kicked out of the military. Then I'll poison myself with gas, got it?! And quit school. Yanie... - Don't even think of crying! - I won't. Let's go home, will we? I'll fry potatoes, we'll watch the TV. No. Have some soup at least. Phew, take it away! Why are you shaming me? You need to. Don't hang out hungry. Please. I'm begging you... I promised to your mom. I'll leave if you eat it. Nuts to you. Fuck anyone you want. I'm eating. Leave! The box. - I'll bring it. - Where to? Either you leave now or I won't eat your shitty soup. Put it in the bag and hide in the bush. I'll come to take it. Okay. I'm eating. Just go. Hear the gunfire? It's in Debaltsevo. So what? He won't come. They'll summon him to work. Damn... It's over you. You've come and messed it up! Is it my fault? If he's killed, I'll turn on all the burners... - He won't be. - How d'you know? I just know. If he's killed... - I'll pray for him. - I asked you not to! Okay, I won't. He won't be killed. Only our guys get killed there. He's mine! Shall we go home or to the shelter? Home. No. I don't want home. Let's go to the shelter. This way. What was it here before? A clinic. See the bath? Clinic for what? Fuck knows. What's this shit? Must be for inhalations. What's it... Chloro... - Chlorophyllipte. - Fucking right. Chlorophyllite. No, spelt with a "t". Chlorophyllipte. - No, I can't pronounce such a bullshit. - Why not? You can. - Chloro... phy... - ...llipte. That's funny. What's in those boxes? Some mud. Yep, mud. Therapeutic mud. - This was a sanatorium? - Yep. A spa. A resort. For curing what? Why the fuck ask me? Like... I don't know... musculoskeletal or digestive issues. Assculoskeletal, that's right Musculo... My granny and I used to go to Mirgorod every year, to a sanatorium. That was a spa, though, there were mud baths too. We drank special waters, had treatments... Shut up and get undressed. We took treatments and... drank oxygen cocktails and... Have you ever tried it? Do you fucking hear me? And I had severe pains in my spine and I needed to wear a support 'cause I had pains and... Are you trying to make me feel sorry for you? You're a human, aren't you? Nope. How not? You did have a sore throat, and treated it inhaling Chlorophyllipte. You didn't like it, did you? You shall have a sore throat from my dick now. It's going to get badly sore. Please, let's not do it today, okay? I'll come for it myself tomorrow, I'll be wanting it, I swear. I don't give a shit when you're wanting it. I don't like it that way. I like it when it's this way, with weeping and screaming. Come on! Come now... It's turned on. Feel it in your mouth. Come on... Yes, do try it. It's a Chloro-fucking-phyllipte! Yes, try it. C'mon, do try it, fucking bitch... - Weren't you a little kid once? - A little shit I was, little shit! - And grew into a fucked-up load of it. - No, you're a good person. You kidding me? I'm a sadist. I love torturing. Open up your mouth. Open up your fucking mouth, bitch! Wider! This fucking wide, yeah! Feel how hard it is? I'm coming! - It's hard for you to live, isn't it? - You feel sorry for me? - Then suck me. - It's different. - Different, it's a human compassion. - Suck me then, Mother Theresa. - Please, no! - Come the fucking on! - Come on, bitch! - I want you! I really do... I really like you. But please, let's not do it not today. You a fucking lunatic? Or a freaking Buddhist, eh? Nice then. Fucking nice. I'll fuck you in the ass until you shit yourself up and then I'll fuck you in your mouth until you vomit. And then I'll get a dozen filthy soldiers down here, who spent three fucking months in muddy trenches with no fuck and they'll fuck you to death. Dron's got a dick that'll reach your tonsils when stuck in. They'll pull you apart, bitch. And your mom will never recognize you. - My mom's dead. - Your mom's dead? Fucking shit! She's dead! I'm about to come! Your fucking misery is turning me on. Who else of your fucking family's dead? You dad's alive? Speak up, bitch! Speak the fuck up! Why keeping mum? - Speak up, cunt! - I love you. What? - I love you. I love you. - What the fuck?! - I love you. - You fucking nuts? I love you. - You take me for some fucking dupe? - No, you are not. You're a good man. I like you. Fucking bitch! Bitch... - Come and fuck me. - Bitch... Yes, come and do it... - Yes, come on... - Bitch... Come... - I'll help you. - Shut you up, bitch. - Shut you up. - Come, come, yes, yes... Get fucking here. Come, yes, yes... Bitch. Fucking slut. Bitch. Yes, yes, yes... Yes, yes, more, more... Yeah! Yeah! Harder! Come sweetie, yeah! Shut the fuck up! Fuck it! I can't keep it up! Fuck! Fucking shit! Come here. Let's have another try. Bitch! - Come here. - Bitch! - Come here. - Fucking shit! Come here. Come here. You think you won me over, you crafty bitch? Reckon you'll be writing how you've duped Phoenix on your FB page when you go free, right? Fuck no! You'll go free in a fucking box. And they they'll write on your FB page: "What a horrible death!" "She was so fucking young..." Get your fucking hands off! - Know what else they'll write? - What? "Why the fuck did she come here?" and "That was her choice." - Come here. - Fuck off, bitch!! My men don't give a shit if you yell or not. I'm the only fucking pervert round here. You'll have 'em coming here one by one. Get fucking ready. Or bash your beans out on that bath, you fucking scumbag bitch! Hi. Hi. How are tricks? I got some grub for you. Pork. I put it on the floor and you'll eat it like a dog. Go ahead. No hands, you have paws. May I eat it like a cat? I had a cat when I was a kid. Why fucking my brains with you being a kid? I had a hamster when I was a kid, so what? What was its name? Fluffy. He bit me on my finger, so I ripped out his teeth. Then his paws. And he was floating in his own blood until drowned. I too ran over a chicken once. O shit! What a fucking disaster! I was driving and it ran across the road... and I... O fucking shit! You're a fucking freak indeed. I stopped the car and went to the yard it ran out of. What the fuck for? To tell them I'd killed it. Fucking great! Did they say you're a goofball? They didn't. They told I owed them 300 hryvnias. A kilo of pan-ready chicken is 50 only. And a whole one cannot cost more than 30. I killed it though, you see? You're a real butcher, baby. I am. Imagine me visiting homes of every Ukrop I've killed and telling their parents: "I've killed your son. "How much a kilo? "How much do I pay?" Fucking funny. What price would you put on a kilo of your lot? A thousand hryvnias. Don't say bullshit. A chicken costs 50. And it never does any harm to anybody. And a fucking trashy and stinky Ukrop, maximum of 25. He's a stinky Ukrop for you. And for his mother and his country he's the best and most precious. You're right, baby. How much does an average Ukrop weigh? - Approximately. - About 70 kilos. 70, okay. Well, times 1,000, it's 70,000, right? He can't fucking cost that much. It fucking turns out then, I owe 'em a fucking million! - You can't owe a million. Okay, not a fucking million, but it's going to be a fuckload of loot. Why aren't you eating? Here, take this. How not a million? Let's recall maths. I've killed about 30 Ukrops, 30 men. We multiply and get... fucking 2,100,000 hryvnias! Well, okay, some weigh less, some cost less. But it's 2 fucking million anyway! It turns out I'm a fucking economic criminal! I'm on Interpol's books for economic crimes. While I'm a hero back at home. My mom's going to get a letter... Like: "Your son has killed thirty enemies, with a total weight of 2,100 kilos..." - And what will she say? - My mom? She's going to be fucked up. She's going to be fucking happy. She'll get a certificate and dough. And they'll ask her to deliver more boys like me. And she'd say: "Are you fucking kidding me? "I'm 55, and I've got menopause." They can have babies at 55 now. Yeah, and they'll get her some fucking amazing doctors and other shit. The point is that the dad has to be the same. The dad... My dad's a drunkard and can't get it up. So what now? Well, it turns out you can't be duplicated then. You're unique in the world. A one off. A one off? A one off... I'm a one off? I'm a one off. I'm a one off. I'm a one off. I am fucking one off! Well, all seems nice, your face and body shapes seem cute, yet there's no hint of sex. No chemistry. You smell of fear. But that's OK. It's my favorite smell. You're my kind of man too. - Your type? - My type. When I saw you first, I thought the ones like you couldn't be fighting on their side. Yeah... You view us all as outcasts and psychos, don't you? I graduated from a college, by the way. One can tell. All my men have. Half of them. You idealize the men on your side, you see? Yeah. Of course I do. Your men don't take gals prisoners. And don't gang bang them. Or execute them. Of course they don't. They're noble. Really? And they don't execute gals, do they? No, they don't. Fucking nice... Fuck... Can you please turn off the water? To stop the dripping. I wasn't going to go to war at all. I was going to build a house. I had my own construction business. The most fucking peaceful business ever. I used to build real palaces for people. But you fuckers forced my hand: what songs to sing and what side to take... You look like my school friend. Sasha Avdeyenko. I really liked him. I'm not your school friend. I'm your enemy. You came here to write your stories about us. You dream of wiping us off the map. If only we'd met a couple of years ago. I wouldn't have even spotted you. - You would have. I was different. - Really? I was different too. I liked kissing girls sitting on park benches. And you liked being humiliated. I didn't. I was different. Sure. You weren't stinking. Look, are you Jewish by chance? All evil in the world comes from the Jews and fucking gays. Gays and Jews never did me any harm. Ah, I see, you're what are you called a fucking liberast. It's not about sex, you see? It's about power. Under the beautiful pretense of fucking "European values" they're making wars, and pit brothers against each other. They are against goodness. Against goodness? - What? - Gays and Jews are against goodness? Yeah, they are. Yes, they arrange all shitty wars, Maidans. - Wait, and the Americans? - They are the ones who set this going. I see. And Banderians and nationalists? Stop talking to me as if I'm a fucking moron. I don't consider you a moron. Think I pile everything together, do you? The pile's fucking too big. A big pile of fucking shit. And it's in power. And they hide behind shitty laws and fucking police. It was fucking liberasts and demotards who invented democracy, the most fucking crafty god, and want us to worship it, hiding behind it like behind a fence. So, where's the truth? The truth? It's in the ass-end of the world. There's much more of it here and now. - Shall I prove it? - No need. Why? Afraid of losing faith in the "European values"? - I believe in one thing. - Which one? - In goodness. - How fucking wrong you are. There's none of it here. You've just said you're for family and other values like these, haven't you? That doesn't mean I'm good. I'll poke out your fucking eye and eat it. Bitch. Hey, stupid one, that was a joke. Wake up. Come wake up. Come. Like this. I'll be washing you. 'Cause you're all piss-soaked. Step over. Get undressed. Hot? Yeah, it hurts. Sorry. Just stick it out. It'll cool down. You'll be nice and clean. You've got a nice bottom. The right size. And the nipples just as I like. Brown. And on the touch, they're like... you know... the fabric they put in coffins. - Velvet? - Right, velvet. Where's your hair? Depilated. What's that? They wax it and then tear off on a strip. - Hurts? - It does. That's okay. You like it when it hurts, don't you? My dick's hard already. I'm kidding. Just checking if you love me or not. Do you? I do. Sit down. I had a dream. You and I were at the Pokrovsky marketplace buying meat. I haven't had peace-time dreams for long. You were saying: "Let's buy veal." "No, we take pork," I reply. "I like pork." We got pork, of course and went for the vegetables, greenery and... We came up to a counter and saw tomatoes. Really huge ones. Like my gram had. What was your gram's name? Liuda. Mine was Valia. She was kind. All grams are kind. Not all. I'm getting cold, Oleg. I'm not fucking Oleg. It frightens me when you cry. I said that because I was frightened. Are you fucking nuts? Fucking Oleg... A right name for a gay. I'm Stas. - I'm Yulia. - I know. I have your ID. Here. Wipe off and get dressed. Sorry, the smallest size there was. Becoming an animal. Me? No, me. You see stuff you never wanted to see. Not death. Death, you know, may be easy or unimportant. We're used to see death like a fucking ultimate end-all. Of course, you'll never forget the first one you killed. But with time, you can take a ring off the tenth one's finger. I never have. I was only happy that wasn't me. And then I was no longer happy 'cause there're no feelings left. The bottom is even more dreadful than death. You look around and see the bottom. You think: "Fucking great! I've hit it!" Still, there's another lower one under that one. And another. And beneath, there's your dead comrade, with his eyes put out. And you think: "Who the fuck could put his eyes out?" A human, like you and me. And then you go and eat. You eat and think: "I'll gouge out next prisoner's eyes when he's alive." Munch-munch... You see? I see. No, you don't fucking see anything. And there's no way back. - There is. - Where? You couldn't even get out of here, while the door was unlocked all the time. I know. Then why didn't you scram? I'm not going without you. Where are you going with me, fucking crazy lady? I don't know. Anywhere. I'm sick in the head. Any trauma can be turned into experience. What do I do with this fucking experience? You did have a peace-time dream, didn't you? So, something's left. Hope. Yeah, that was a funny dream. Only I didn't tell you the rest... I started getting the meat ready for a BBQ, looked at it and saw maggots all over. You've just made that up. Sit here, Yulie. Sit beside me for a while. Like on a park bench. Nope. More like on a fence. Benches have wider seats. Yeah. Like on a fence, exactly. Hope, you say? Yeah. Stupid one you are. Shall we kiss? Yes. I'm not even going to touch your breasts. Do you like it? Very much. Can you hear? What? Cicadas. I can. Fucking amazing. Will you wait for a moment? I will. Don't turn back, OK? I'm so much scared of you. I see. Take that! Take that! And that! And that! Good evening. What do you want? Sam, stop it! Stop it! We don't open to people from the highway. You were raped? I can call the police. No need. I ran over your hen. So what? It's dying. What do you want from US? From you? Vasia, Vasia! - What? - Vasia, come over here. - Hi. - Good evening. Here's a lady saying she's run over our hen. She wants something. I don't know... What do you want? I was driving and it rushed out right under the wheels. Don't make up stories. A suicidal hen indeed. It's you were driving fast, without your eyes the road. No, I was driving slowly... It's dark now and it ran out somehow suddenly. And what do you want from us now? You killed our hen and now you're here. Should we thank you or what? I understand I cannot bring it back to life. Let me pay for it. - Great! - Which hen was it, Vasia? Our brood-hen or not? I'm so sorry. I'm shocked too... I've got a parrot, so I understand... Maybe, it's still alive? Maybe you'd... go and check? I could take it to a veterinarian. I have a box in the trunk to put it in... If it's not bleeding too much. The box is a paper one, you know. The brood one. Why did you do that? Maybe, it might have been saved, eh? Yeah... then put a cast on, and buy a wheelchair for it and take it to the sanatorium from time to time. All right. How much is it? I'm not sure. Well, it was our brood-hen... Give us 100 hryvnias and God be with you. - Vasia... - What? I don't know; how much d'you think? I've never sold hens like that. - You give us 200 hryvnias and... - Okay, just a moment. Jesus, I have no cash about me. I've bought honey. - I've got a bank card only. - I see... Vasia, do we accept bank cards? We don't. Well, maybe you have a cash machine somewhere around? We do. In the hen house. Alright. I'll bring it tomorrow. Sure you will. She'll bring it tomorrow. Cut the fairytales, lady. Just go, lady. Let it be on your conscience. How can I? I'll go, withdraw the money and be back right away. 200 hryvnias. - A cash machine... - Sam, down! - As good as a circus. - Indeed. Sam, go. Go! Sam, on guard. Just look over there... - Who's there? - Her. Sam, down! Down! Kennel up! Sam, go! Nasty dog! Kennel up! - You're back, eh? - Yes, as I promised. Well, you know... everyone's just promising now... Come on in. Don't be afraid. He doesn't bite. Just promising... Beginning with the President and ending with everyone else... Without fulfilling their promises. Come in, don't be afraid. Sam, go! Just go! Kennel up! Nasty dog indeed! Go! I can't watch the news on TV. I say to Vasia: "Just turn off the news, I'm fed up. When will they eat their fill, eh?" - Here. - Ah... I've plucked it already. I thought it would go into the borscht... But you ran it over so badly that... we had to give it to the dog. - It's terrible. - It is. It is... It's as usual... The poor are always short of luck. And it... it was laying 30 eggs a month, a golden hen indeed... It was. And 10 eggs cost 30 hryvnias. So, we've lost, allow, another 100 hryvnias per month. And... to count it for a year, it turns out to be 1,200 hryvnias... And it could have laid eggs for the next two years, so it's 2,400. A simple hen it might seem, but turned out to have been precious. Look, I have 1,000 hryvnias. I didn't think a hen could cost that much... And I talked to her... I didn't talk to other ones, but when I talked to her, she did understand what I was saying... She was no ordinary hen. No ordinary one at all... She was really smart... If, God forbid, you parrot would be run over... I don't have that much even on the bank card... I've withdrawn the last. - Vasia! - What? She has 1,000 hryvnia's only. That's just silly. What do we do? We call the police. They'll come and fine you and suspend your driver's license. The only thing, it takes them too long to arrive when called. There, with the neighbors, some guys from the highway came in and beat Kolia up... His wife called the police. They came the next day in the morning only. Kolia died. That's why, we'll lock you in the cellar. You'll wait for the police and do thinking. You can't be serious. Actually, you've killed our hen. Well, take my bracelet. - What it's made of? - Silver. It costs nothing. Actually, it does. There's much silver in it. How much? I don't know. It's a gift. And what's that on your neck? It costs nothing. It's dear to me as a keepsake. - It's gold. - It's not gold. It is. I know gold. It's a gift from the man I love. Dammit, we loved our hen too. Let me hold this. I'll come with money tomorrow... ...to buy back all my things. Okay? You can keep it. Okay, thanks. What d'you have in your car? In my car? Honey. I've bought honey. You want honey? No. We have our own. Thanks a lot. And what car is this? An ordinary one. No. I know ordinary ones. Which make is it? A Peugeot. A Peugeot... A good car it is. And must be expensive... Well, may I go? Where to? Home. Yura! Come here, Diana's crying! I've got my hands in dough! Let it go. Go. Just go. Sam! Sam, go home! Stupid thing. I say go home! Come. Come in, good dog. Do come on in. Come here I say. Come on in. "...yet, there were casualties. Two soldiers were injured by an explosive device in the Volnovakha Rayon, Donetsk Oblast.
