Björk. After 20 years of making music, selling millions of albums and challenging every kind of musical convention, she is embarking on her most ambitious project yet. To change the way we see, hear, think about and make music. 'This is probably, like, very ambitious 'and sort of, in a way, a very grand project.' Bringing together nature, technology and music, she's called her album Biophilia. # I shuffle around # The tectonic plates... # And she has a surprising collaborator. 'Welcome to Biophilia. The love for nature in all her manifestations.' # Like a virus... # In a very special encounter, Björk and Sir David Attenborough will discover what happens when their two worlds come face to face. A song grows sort of a bit like a crystal. Like, this would be a 6/8 kind of song. -Yes. There's a mathematical basis, isn't there? -Yes. And there's a mathematical basis to crystals. -Exactly. Björk will explore the science of sound, invent incredible instruments, create new forms of musical notation in her quest to use nature and technology to help us understand musical structure in a radical new way. Seems to be around this... about age that I am now that you have to make a spiritual statement. With Biophilia, Björk is seeking to discover a more natural and intuitive way for all of us to make music in the 21st century. 'We are on the brink of a revolution 'that will reunite humans with nature. 'Prepare. Explore. Biophilia.' # No-one imagines # The light shock I need # And I'll never know. # 'A lot of my sort of inspiration 'and how sort of music and sound function, 'is very much built upon when I was a kid. 'I would walk 40 minutes to school and back, any weather, 'and my little way of dealing with that was just to sort of sing. 'And that would be when I was walking in nature, kind of on my own. 'So, for me, the line blurs so easily between music and nature 'because that's almost like the same thing for me.' # Scrape those barnacles off me. # Iceland, November 2010. And early choir rehearsals are under way in preparation for a three-year world tour. For, for. For, for. Even Björk's all-female choir is unconventional. Many have trained together since they were six years old. They've been chosen for their remarkable sound and precision. The scope of Biophilia is vast, travelling from the outer reaches of the solar system to the inner worlds of cells. For me, this project is about the sound of sound and celebrating how sound works, in nature. Björk wants to redefine how we can make music in the 21st century. But to do that, we must first go back to understand its origins. She has come to London's Natural History Museum, where a fan has offered to give her a guided tour. How nice to see you. Good to see you. Do you like this place? - Yes. It's very epic. - It's a great place. There's everything here, from microbes to man to minerals. Everything. It looks like a cathedral. Isn't it? The first director was very keen that it should be a cathedral in praise of creation. With 58 million animals and nine million fossils, it's the biggest natural history collection in the world. And those are birds of paradise. Isn't that extraordinary? That's a headdress nearly three times the length of your body. - You've probably done that! - Yeah, definitely. Björk is here because of what we can learn about the evolution of singing from the animal kingdom. By and large, the more beautiful the bird, the simpler its music. The simpler its call. And there's the lyrebird. - See the beautiful tail it's got. - Yeah. The lyrebird song is probably the most complex bird song ever. Is that the one you see on YouTube imitating mobile phones and sirens? That's the very one. Because part of the way it shows off to the female how clever he is, how wonderful he is, is not only by making music but by imitating everybody else's music. So that if you listen in the bush in southern Australia, you may think you're surrounded by ten different species, but they're all actually made by that lyrebird singing its songs. And the lyrebird doesn't just mimic other birds. Its repertoire includes car alarms... ..and chain saws. Not unlike Björk, it's developed a phenomenal vocal range which offers a clue to the importance and purpose of singing. Your voice is a very odd voice, Björk! I mean really. The fact that your larynx can produce this extraordinary range of sound. It can't be just an accident. That range of sound was at one time or another valuable and functional. And that you are exploiting it in a way which would have made sense ancestrally. That makes a lot of sense. Actually, the human larynx is capable of so much more variety of sound than is required for language. That, to a biologist, would mean that there was a function of the human voice which preceded language. So that it's actually singing is more fundamental to us than speaking. So we're actually born all free-jazz singers - ..but we're just chatting away. - Yes, yes, it is. So how do you think music works for us now, the modern people? Well, one is absolutely clear, and that is the sexuality of music. I mean, in, as it were, classical times, troubadours singing up to their lady loves up on the balcony, "come and join me" or "let me come in". But in our own culture now, I mean, pop music is hugely sexual, there can't be any doubt about that. And that's why it is so popular amongst people between 15 and 30. That's the peak of sexuality and it's the peak of the passion about music. But it's not just about sex. Even our animal cousins are expressing something less functional. Gibbons have one of the loveliest songs and loveliest animal music in the whole animal kingdom. When a male and female get together, a pair forms and when that happens, they sing together. And the great song of the gibbons is highly complex and both male and female take part in it. And I find that very touching. But whether it's touching or not, it seems to me incontrovertibly beautiful. They don't know it's beautiful, they're just exulting. The mystery to me is how music has been used by humanity to take us beyond territory, beyond sexuality, into something that is transcendental. After three months of rehearsing, Björk's choir are getting closer to mastering her compositions. But this is just the beginning. Björk still has to find a way to turn her ambitions for harnessing the power of the natural world into a radical musical performance. You know, this project's about, like, the universe and the galaxy and lightning and, you know, it's like, it's so mega. But I'm sort of, I calm myself down and I think, OK, this is going to be the once in a lifetime that I'm going to even attempt to go there. Takk. APPLAUSE MUSICAL NOTES PLAY March 2011 and Björk is in a small metal workshop near the Thames estuary. She's come to meet Henry Dagg, a sound sculptor who's created one of the world's most unusual instruments - the Sharpsichord. # I feel # You compress her # Into a small space... # This solar-powered instrument is a cross between a harp and a barrel organ. It's taken him five years to build. It's programmed by putting pins into a steel cylinder. With 11,500 holes to choose from, it takes a day to programme just a minute of music. # That will make her shine # Tell her that you love her... # I didn't do right the phrasing. No, I think you were a bar behind. - Yeah, I know. I know what... - In the B section. I have to... I'll work it out. Yeah. It's in the same key and it would harmonise with that extra line so, erm, I can run it until it ends. MUSIC: "Sacrifice" by Björk # Why can't you give her room? # Respect her spatial needs # I feel you compress her # Into a small space... # WIND BLOWS All our senses come from nature, our reactions come from nature. The obvious stimulus that you can think of in nature or the inspiration that comes from nature, is because you feel that flower is beautiful, or you feel that that bird soaring in the sky is beautiful. It's not nature, it's the feeling of the composer about nature. And if you had a composer who was insensitive to the beauties of nature, didn't matter how photographically he reproduced the sounds, it wouldn't be worth a tuppence. WAVES CRASH MUSIC: "Sea Interludes" by Benjamin Britten This music is from the Sea Interludes by Benjamin Britten. OBOE PLAYS AN ARPEGGIO That seems to me clearly to represent the rivulets, the waves just trickling up the shore and then trickling back. And that, presumably, is the mighty ocean behind. It's not just painting a picture of nature, it's much more important than that. It is a human being talking to a human being. It is not a human being talking to a landscape or a mountain. It is Britten speaking to you. MUSIC: "Crystalline" by Björk But Björk isn't just inspired by how nature feels. She's inspired by what it is, how it's structured. Overturning convention, Björk wants to bring nature itself into her compositions. With this song, Crystalline, Björk uses the similarities between musical structures and the structures of crystals to create a song which mirrors the form of its subject. And what better place to explore them than in the Natural History Museum's massive crystal room. Wow, that's lush. It looks like some sort of a forest. Quartz. One, two, three, four, five, six. A reflection of the shape of the silica dioxide molecule. All packed together. The molecules will be, as it were, six-sided, so when they're packed together, they form these six-sided shapes. And it's amazing how many people won't believe that these aren't man-made. You know, they think, how could that actually happen in nature? And I think that's miraculous. For me, it's quite interesting how the range of crystals, how like, totally different. They can look really hard and merciless but then really fragile and pretty, you know. But this six-sided basis, I mean, the basis of mathematics lies at the heart of crystals, and mathematics lies at the heart of many of your songs, doesn't it, really? I mean, because it's about the spheres, it's about the universe, it's about the fundamental things like mathematics. Yeah, and kind of has inner logic to it. A basic structure, yeah. Well, also of course, I mean, beats in the bar - I mean, you can have three beats in the bar or two beats in the bar or four beats in the bar, and there's a mathematical basis, isn't there, to bars, and there's a mathematical basis to crystals. Yeah, that's why it sort of seems a very natural fit. Like, this would be uh... a 6/8 kind of song. In Crystalline, Björk has turned the structure of crystals into an unusual combination of time signatures. The verses are in 17/8, and then in the chorus, it sort of goes into 4/4, and then it's like a square, more like a square. Absolutely. Or in this instance, a cube. -Yeah. CHOIR: # Crystalline # Internal nebula # Crystalline... # Now, Björk's choir must learn how to actually sing it. # Crystalline # I conquer claustrophobia # Crystalline # And demand the light # Crystalline # Listen how they grow # Crystalline # Listen how they grow # Crystalline # Listen how they grow # Crystalline # Listen how they grow... # Biophilia's musical director Matt Robertson guides them. ..That makes it really easy or really complicated. So if you're a counting-type person, that's how to do it, if you're a listening type person, then you just have to listen to it. Mathematics... I wish I was a mathematician, which I'm not. But you sense the beauty. I know a mathematician would talk about the beauty of an equation, and you can sense that when you hear a five-part fugue by Bach, which also has a mathematical beauty. And the fact that you look at crystals and have called one of your compositions Crystalline because it is about the mathematics, the fundamental mathematics, which is the foundation of so much in the natural world, and so much which is sublime. 'Symmetry is an element in musical structure, 'and it's an element in visual structure.' From the microscopic to the galactic, our universe consists of remarkable patterns. Music is also made up of patterns, but these are usually only heard, not seen. Björk wants to change that. She wants to find ways of visualizing sound so that we can understand the ways in which is works. Evan Grant works with cymatics - the science of turning sound into images. What I've got here in front of me is what's called a Chladni plate. What it is is a glorified speaker really. I mean, in the same way that your speaker can move like this to resonate and pump sound out to you. This can do that, but it has a post attached to this plate. So I can vibrate this plate. By covering this with sand, I can then play a frequency into this and these patterns will start to emerge. OSCILLATING SOUND When we visualize sound through it, the lower frequencies or the lower pitches are simpler, the patterns are less complex and as we go up in frequency or up in pitch, they get more complex, more dense, arguably more beautiful. HIGH-PITCHED SOUND All around us, things are vibrating and changing and shifting, and cymatics is like this window into that. It enables us to reveal these things that we couldn't normally see. Where do these patterns come from? There's no trickery here, there's no complex science here, I'm just literally vibrating something. And all of a sudden these seemingly endless, stunning geometric patterns emerge. One of the things I love about Björk and her approach to music is that she's very scientific. She takes this very holistic approach, she looks at everything, she digs into the world and into existence to try and bring real substance and real meaning to her music. And, so, it was a fascinating idea for me to try and visualize one of her tracks using cymatics in water. And this is what Crystalline looks like when we see all the components of the song visualized. # Listen how they grow # I'm blinded by the lights # Listen how they grow # In the core of the earth # Listen how they grow # Crystalline Internal nebula # Crystalline # Rocks growing slow mo # Crystalline # I conquer claustrophobia... # Seeing as well as hearing Crystalline gives it an extra dimension. And it's this extra dimension that is driving Björk towards her next and most dramatic challenge - to find a way to bring nature onto the stage with her for the first performance of Biophilia. It seems to me like I'm now letting nature be like a superhero, basically. Showing nature off, like it's like... wow! June 2011. Final rehearsals before the world premiere of Biophilia at the Manchester International Festival. Henry Dagg has brought his two-and-a-half-tonne Sharpsichord. It's the only one in the world. - How are we doing on that top cornice? - Yeah, we're OK. And is it solar-powered? - Not in England! - No. BELLS RING It's not the only extraordinary thing in the room. COIL BUZZES Björk has assembled an array of ground-breaking ways in which to harness the musical power of the natural world on stage. Nikola Tesla invented the Tesla coil in the 19th century to conduct pioneering experiments into electricity. He probably never imagined that it would be used as a musical instrument. But the most unusual instrument has been specially designed and built just for Biophilia. Björk wanted to find a vivid way of using the power of gravity within her performance. She worked with Andy Cavatorta from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Early on in the process, Björk had told me that one of the things she wanted to do was have this message that nature and natural forces are like a rock star. HE LAUGHS So she wants to have gravity and electricity and different forms of energy and all sorts of stuff, displayed in a very, very raw way, harnessed in very raw ways to make music. THEY SPEAK ICELANDIC Björk's creativity is occasionally ahead of what people know how to do technically, which is a great place to be. I got obsessed with basslines. And pendulum basslines, both in classical music and folk music. They seem to be an international sort of thing. And very often the mood of the songs, they all are similar. BASSLINE PLAYS And they sort of do like a dum, dum, dum... SHE HUMS BASSLINE This is a bassline by John Tavener that I like a lot. I went back home and spent, like, a long and sleepless weekend putting together the very first prototype that I think all of us felt really clicked. And we would make little films of these things and send them off to Björk and see what she thought. And this is going to sound really beautiful but we're extra psyched about how it could look. So we're going to show you. MUSIC PLAYS Just by changing and playing around with the rhythms in which the notes happened, you could sort of make all these different musical feelings happen. So that was great. It wasn't nearly enough to be able to play a complex song like Solstice. But I think it demonstrated to all of us that there was something really engaging about just watching these pendulums. As they come through the very bottom of their swing, there's a little plectrum that sticks out and it plucks an instrument on the end. It's a big circular harp and they have a big cylinder with the strings coming down the outside. And the harp can be turned to play different notes. HARP NOTES PLAY This pendulum harp harnesses gravity to play each note. This song, Solstice, is about the earth's rotation about its own axis and the sun. With this instrument, the audience will see and hear gravity on stage. Björk is using bespoke instruments to alter how her music is perceived. And finding new ways of understanding our experience of music is central to Biophilia. Professor Oliver Sacks, the legendary neurologist, has been a key inspiration. 'He is sort of the David Attenborough of the brain and the nervous system.' Music has charms which nothing else has. It can provide forms of emotion, forms of enjoyment, transports states of mind, states of body peculiar to it. Music pulls on so many brain functions and unifies them. One sees that almost every part of the brain is involved, and one saw that not only the auditory areas, but motor areas, visual areas, prefrontal areas, cerebellum, basal ganglia. All of these different things were lighting up in the brain and interacting and playing together. And music can do this more than language, more than anything else. This effect of music in somehow rewiring the brain is apparent in people suffering with various neurological conditions, like these dementia patients in London. ALL: # Daisy, Daisy # Give me your answer, do... # For people with dementia, you need music which is charged with emotion and with memory, music which is familiar, music which is evocative, music which will provide a bridge to the past. At such times, you see people suddenly recovering memories and identities which seemed unavailable to them. And they will be not only released in the playing of the piece, but this sort of release may go on for half an hour or an hour afterwards. # Oh, I love you, I really do... # Here we go! # I love you # It's a sin to tell a lie. # Music can affect one at a level far deeper than speech and language. It's often said that music tries to express what language can't. If you ask what it's expressing, it's expressing itself. Tonight is the first ever performance of Biophilia, the culmination of three years of development. 2,000 people are about to hear a very familiar voice. DAVID ATTENBOROUGH: 'Welcome to Biophilia, 'the love for nature in all her manifestations, 'from the tiniest organism to the greatest red giant 'floating in the farthest realm of the universe. 'Just as we use music to express parts of us 'that would otherwise be hidden, 'so, too, can we use technology to make visible 'much of nature's invisible world. 'In Biophilia, you will experience how the three come together - 'nature, music, technology.' CHEERING AND APPLAUSE I think music, for a lot of people... well, everyone, probably, is such a beautiful catalyst between reality and the outer world and the inner world, where you can actually make some sort of a sense of it all. And, yeah, it's pretty abstract where you can actually... There's room in music for everything, for all these little bits that you cannot fit into your everyday life. # Stirring at water's edge # Cold froth # On my twig # May I or should I # Or have I too often? # Craving miracles # May I... # In Thunderbolt, Björk has found a way of harnessing the natural power of lightning. The electrical crackle of the Tesla coil provides the bassline for the song. # My romantic gene is dominant # And it hungers for union... # The performance brings nature, music and technology together. Björk wants to develop a new kind of music-making which is intuitive and accessible for everyone, and this is the ultimate aim of the Biophilia project. # May I or should I # Or have I too often now # Craved miracles? # May I, should I # Or have I too often now # Craved miracles? # THUNDER AND LIGHTNING CRASHES Björk's Biophilia project is driven by her desire to change the way we understand music. A desire that goes back to her childhood and her classical musical education. Like when I was in music school when I was a kid there were a lot of things that rubbed me the wrong way. It was hard for me to connect with being in Iceland and we were basically getting curriculums from Europe based on 17th-century German classical music, as much as I adore that, but at that time I wanted to... you know, to connect more with Iceland. You know, and also just, how it had become really academic and was removed from the physical. This academic approach to music education can act as a barrier to people actually making music. With the music we have now, there's something intimidating. You look at this, at this page, what is that? Much more complicated than a page of print. And you look at all these black and white things. This is very intimidating. And if there was some way of drawing anyone interacting with music or creating their own music, I think that would be extraordinary. And this is the challenge that Björk accepted. To find a way of using technology to make playing music more intuitive. Her collaborator in this phase is music engineer Damian Taylor. Early experiments went back to basics. Instead of a keyboard, he tried using a ball and even a cardboard box. The first physical control that we used in the context of the project was this, which is a $9 video game controller. It's definitely very interesting, I think, to be able to give people something that generates music that's not tied in with, in a way, the baggage of all the instruments we've had around for hundreds of years or their evolution. Björk's solution to the challenge ultimately lay in the 21st-century revolution, which came with touch screens. One of the exciting things about touch screens - you could have the same kind of relationship, spontaneous and instant, as you would, say, to a tambourine. From this came the idea to create something which might go beyond a traditional album with numbered tracks. A new kind of simpler musical notation was designed and each song would be an interactive app that would reveal a different musical principle. To create these apps, Björk is working with some of the best computer programming minds in the world. Like pioneering interactive artist Scott Snibbe. What Björk wanted us to do was take music from where it is now as, you know, mostly just as something in your ears while you're walking, and turn it in to something full sensory again. One of the most fascinating things about having a touch screen for an electronic musician is that now you can connect with more irregular rhythms but it's still natural. So we made an app called Moon, where you can just, with the stroke of a finger, change the length of a sequence. You can change the kind of phase of a pearl to change a note and you change the phase of the moon to change how many notes play back at once. And then you can choose whether to accompany it to Björk's song or to just play it solo as your own instrument. Björk is creating apps that use our intuitive understanding of the natural world to help explain musical principles. # The tectonic plates... # Mutual Core is about chords. I don't know if you noticed but when you play around on the piano, you can put, like, two or three fingers and make a chord. And I thought the best way to sort of show the tension that can either arise or be relieved, it would be best shown in strata. Maybe this is just me coming from Iceland, thinking this is something that everybody understands because it's in their everyday life. But you have different layers of different types of rocks and then just a little pressure away or together is going to change the tension. And this is sort of, for me, is really similar how I experience the difference of chords. I was mapping out how I can explain in the most simple way to a kid about arpeggios. The most famous example in pop music is probably I Feel Love by Donna Summer. When you get the # Dugga dugga dugga dugga dugga dugga dugga dug # Dugga dugga dugga dugga dugga dugga dugga dugga. # And that's basically a chord, if you play like a chord, but it's called broken chords, so you don't hear all the notes at the same time. You would hear them first the first one, then the second one, then the third one and again and again and again. And the lightning would be a really good way to teach about arpeggios. Thunderbolt is an app that's actually more like an instrument. When you tap, you create these electrical sparks. When you draw, you create these, like, lightning drawings that have beautiful lightning samples too. When you put down two fingers and they're close together, it plays one note over and over again. And then when you stretch your fingers apart it plays two, three, four, five. And when you raise your fingers you go faster, you increase the tempo. And when you lower your fingers you go slower. By changing the visual representation, you actually change the way people think about music and the kind of music they create. Now Björk has found the technology to realise her ambition, she has to find out if people will engage with it. She starts by rolling out a programme of music workshops for children around the world. Here in Buenos Aires, a class learn about arpeggios by playing the Tesla coil. I always thought I would run a music school when I would grow up. You know, and then, just all these other things kind of happened. And so, for me, this project is sort of my music school. Her apps are now a standard part of the music curriculum in Iceland. If one is actively involved in music, then you do begin to get all sorts of changes in the brain, which are also useful for purposes outside music. And this at any age. Ideally it should be in childhood, but it can happen later. And if you have massive involvement in playing music, then many different parts of the brain become enlarged. Björk's radical Biophilia project was four years in the making. A year after premiering in Manchester, Björk's tour reaches the ancient city of Fes. # Heaven # Heaven's bodies # Whirl around me # Make me wonder... # Music unites one to other people. You sing together, you dance together, you drum together... ..at a pre-verbal level, at a very elemental level. 'It is an essential part of what makes us human. 'And it has something very profound, 'it produces a very profound reaction in us all.' It is one of the strands which enable you to build relationships and to actually to live with yourself too. # Heaven # Heaven's bodies # Whirl around me # Make me wonder # And they say back then... # Music, like all art, has this deathless quality and can remove one from what otherwise is the sphere of thinking biologically. I do very much now. In my 80th year, I'm falling apart. This is failing, that's failing, but the music is as good as it ever was. In fact possibly better. # ..We know # Heaven # Heaven's bodies # Whirl around me # Make me wonder... # Music, to be most rewarding, actually does require work, does require concentration, does require thought, which is why your music is so challenging, because... Well, because it does require thought. And it's... So much of what you do is completely new, hasn't been done by people before. And that's what's challenging about it, so if you're very tired, I don't suggest that I put on... If I'm very tired I don't put on your music. I put on your music when I want to really think about something. Well thank you, that's, uh... I'll take that as a compliment. It's meant as. THEY LAUGH # Heaven # Heaven's bodies # Whirl around me # And dance eternal. # Subs resynced by JohnCoffey_09
