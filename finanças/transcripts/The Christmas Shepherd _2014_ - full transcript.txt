This program is rated g and is suitable for general audiences. Graham, that's wonderful. Yeah, absolutely. I... i-I'm thrilled. Yeah, it'll be great, it'll be great. I'm so excited, I'm thrilled, and buddy is, too. Yeah, I've got some illustrations already started, and, uh, I think you'll be very happy. Okay, well, I'll get you the signed contracts asap. Signed, sealed and delivered. Okay, and thank you so much again, Graham. Buddy thanks you, I thank you. Okay. All right, you take care. Bye. Buddy, guess what? Guess what? You're gonna be a star! They loved it! Come on, buddy. Good boy. Up you go. So you sold the publisher the concept? Yeah. Yeah, it's going to be about a dog named buddy born on Christmas day. Thank you. I've got some of the illustrations done. I don't have the story, but buddy's going to help with that. Will you give me some celery, please? I'm so proud of you, Sally. Dylan would be over the moon. Yeah. Are those for mom's stuffing? Yeah, it wouldn't be Thanksgiving without it, but you're going to help me. Please? I need help. Yeah, I'm taking Wednesday off. I will be your sous chef. Okay, good. It's been so warm, it's kind of hard to get into the holiday mood. Not for buddy. Yeah? Oh, yeah, you want this one? Or this one? Which one do you want? This one's much prettier. You like that one? Is that the one you want? Oh, don't chew it up! You don't chew it up... Buddy, come here. Let's go pay for it. We can't steal it, you little monkey. Unbelievable. What is it, buddy? Oh, he does this every time we're in town. I know. Papa's on an adventure, honey. He's on an adventure. We'll be together sometime, I promise. Yeah... I miss him, too, bud. Come on, bud, let's go. All right? Good boy. You go home. Good boy. Pardon me. Hey. What happened to photo club? I decided not to join. They only shoot digital. It's tough being the new kid, huh? You know, they made fun of my "ancient" camera. Old-school is good. Your old man is old-school. You're not that old, dad. Ah, I'm pretty old. Come on, inside, I'll make you something. Dad, we've been open a month. I don't get it, where is everybody? Well, they are currently down the road at the new drive-thru Starbucks. Don't worry, we'll turn it around. Can I get you anything? Uh, sure. Banana and blueberry? All right, you got it. Dad, no! Not "the smoothie dance." Someone might see you. What's that, you can't feel the music, huh? I know you do this just to embarrass me. I live to embarrass you. Dad! Say, that Christmas tree lot, it just opened up over on mulberry. What do you say we go over there and pick one up? You think it's a bit early? I just thought it might be fun, you know? Just like old times. It'll never be like old times, dad. Well, we'll just have to make do, all right? All right. I'll make you one here. One of these days, that rusty old thing is going to break down and strand you somewhere. I love big red. She never lets me down. Honey, no grown woman ever names her pick-up. You've been living out in the sticks too long. You worry too much. I was going to call you last night, because I heard the Cullen house is up for sale. Oh, yeah, I love that old place. Mm-hmm, and it's so close to town. Margie, listen, I have spent so much of my life living on bases. When we bought that home, it was to set down roots. It's my little acre of heaven. Think about your social life. My what? My what? What is that? What's my social life... What social life is that? I have my art studio, my garden, my work, my solitude, I've got buddy, and that's all. I'm happy. Life is good. But thank you so much for worrying about me, it's very sweet. That's crazy. It should be snowing this time of year. Buddy does not like this kind of weather. The national weather service has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for wharton creek .And the surrounding communities lightning, high winds, rain, and hail... D...road visibility is diminished as wind and lashing rain have been reported. Buddy? Hey, buddy! Buddy? Buddy! Buddy! Buddy! Oh, no. Oh, no. Buddy? Buddy! -Hey, sis. -Hi. Something has happened to buddy and I need your help. Can you help me find him, please? I'm sorry, you guys. Yes... I'll be right back. Hey, babe, hi. No... No. Hi. No, he wasn't micro-chipped. I mean, he has a collar on that's got his name on it. It's just, everybody here knows him. I just never thought that this would happen. I'd advise you to keep making the rounds. Most of the shelters around here aren't set up to board animals more than a week. Okay. Uh, thank you. Oh! You scared the heck out of me, little guy. Buddy, huh? I've got some water in the back of my chariot and half a Turkey sandwich. I bet you're starving, huh? Come on. Come on... Good boy. â™ª Deck the halls with... No way. Hey, buddy, come on, boy. Come here. Come here, boy. Smile, buddy. Buddy! He seems a little sluggish, paws look kind of bad. He's probably been doing a lot of walking. I'll have our staff vet take a look. I wish I could take him home, the old lady's allergic to everything. His name is "buddy." Probably a thousand "buddy's" out there. Not like this one. Good luck, little fellow. Hey, come on. We visited every shelter within 20 miles from here, but it's just, just nothing, so we decided to expand the search to 40 miles, you know? Anything on the missing pet finder? No, I just, I go online every day, but, um... There's nothing. I don't know, Jack, he's just, he's been gone for a week. I wish I was there to help you, mom. I know you do, baby, I know. Just, uh, just say a prayer, okay? Yeah, I will. I can almost smell your stuffing. Yeah. Grandma's recipe, right? Hey, Jack! I made a Dutch apple pie in your honor. Aw, thanks, aunt Beth. You look skinny. Are you eating over there? Mom, I'm okay. Okay, well, when you get back in June, we're going to have Thanksgiving, all the trimmings, all your favorites, you hear me? Listen, ma, I gotta go. They're calling me. Happy Thanksgiving, mom. Now, don't worry about buddy, okay? He's going to find you. I know, love. You take care of yourself, you hear me? I love you, baby, I love you. I love you, too, mom. Be safe. I will. I love you, mom. Bye. Bye. Dog food, wet and dry. 10 dog beds, 10 leashes... Em, your aunt and I are leaving! Why don't you come out and say bye? 'Tis the season. Speaking of, I've been thinking about presents. Oh, yeah? I thought you were lobbying for a low-key Christmas? I thought it might be fun to start a darkroom in the basement. Like your mom had in the old house? Your mom would love that, em. Why don't you put it on your wish list? Dad, I'm too old for wish lists. Aw, you're never too old for wishing. Mrs. Carlson will be by after school. That essay, I proofread it, it's on the counter. And, uh, dinner is in the fridge if we're late. Dad, I can take care of myself. Atta girl. Go, have fun. Yeah. Okay, you are coming with me. How many can you take, Greta? Finding forever homes for 10 is the magic number. I'll take this poodle as well. Hey, fella. What's your name? Buddy. Good name. We had a Shepherd when we were growing up. Stella, she was a great dog. Yeah, look at you. Look at you... Hey, he likes military guys. Huh, buddy? Huh? I was in the reserves. Hey... Can I take him out? Sure. Get to know his personality? Somebody wants to play. Oh, you see I have it, don't you? You want to play, don't you? Yes, you do... Yeah? You want to play some fetch? Yeah? Let's see what you got, huh? Here you go. Why don't you adopt him? I'd love to, but I just don't think that Emma's up for that yet. Someone's going to, right? Come on. Oh, no. No, no. I told you, we have no room at the inn. There's no room in that Van. It's full. Good boy, good boy. Mom would have asked me first. Just because I'm 13, my opinion doesn't count? Look, I'm sorry, hon', all right? But I had to make a decision on the spot, and that's what I did. Dad, he's sick. No, he's...He's fine. His paws got a little bit beat up when he ran away. Your aunt said that she'll find him a permanent situation, but he'll be with us for a couple of weeks, tops. I'm sure he's a wonderful dog, but he deserves a real family, and I'm not sure that's us anymore. Em, come on. I know what you're doing. Don't make me fall in love with you. You're just passing through. You any good with geometry? Time to get up, kiddo. Has that been going on all night? Pretty much. I didn't have the heart to wake him. Need to go out, bud? Hey! Hey... Thanks, buddy! Good boy. What a good boy you are, huh? You brought the paper for me. That a boy. Hey. Hi. Oh, that's okay. Hey. Getting him ready for his new home? That's the plan. I don't really think he needs this gauze anymore. I was just getting used to having him around. Yeah, it's been great, hasn't it? Can I help? Yeah, go ahead. He's lucky to have you taking care of him. This reminds me of when we brought mom home from the hospital. Remember? We had to put the bed in the living room because she couldn't walk up the stairs anymore. Yeah. She was happy to be home. I don't want him to go, dad. Just look at him. He's so happy here. Can't we be his forever family? That's a big responsibility. Buddy fits in like he's already a part of our home. Are you sure, em? Can we still call him "buddy"? Absolutely. You hear that, buddy? I'll be honest with you, Graham, I'm finding it nearly impossible to work. Just, all I can think of is where is he, and is he safe? Um, I know that you want the book by Christmas, but I just, I just don't know, with buddy gone, if I can... Um, can I give you a call back? Yeah, okay. I'm-I'm really sorry, Graham. Yeah, thanks. Buddy! Oh, my god... Buddy... I just... don't understand how he got all the way to Monroe? I mean, that's two hours from here. I didn't check the shelters that far. When I found him, I was driving west. Monroe was the first shelter that I came across. Oh, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Was he okay? Was he hurt or anything? Considering he was totally lost, he was doing pretty good. Oh, good. Thank god. 'Cause he's been missing for almost three weeks now. Well, I felt terrible about leaving him there, but my wife's allergic, and I just couldn't bring him home. After a few days, I started checking online, looking for missing Shepherds, and I found your posting. Well, I just, I can't thank you enough. And you deliver Christmas trees, too, that's... That would only happen to buddy. He sure seems like an amazing dog, Mrs. Brown. Yeah. I'm not seeing anything in the log. The clinic director will be in tomorrow. Okay, um, the trucker said that it was sometime around Thanksgiving. Is there any way you could check around that date? Oh, wait a minute, here we go. We had a Shepherd named buddy probably about five years old? Yeah, that could absolutely be him. Um, he's not here anymore? Where would he be? Boston. In Boston? Noah's ark pet rescue, this is Greta. Hi, um, my name is Sally brown, and I'm calling about my German Shepherd. His name is buddy, and I was wondering if he was still at your, uh, your kennel. Buddy, y-yeah. Yes, he wears a white collar, and it's got Holly... Yeah, with his name painted on the side? Ms. Brown, are you still there? Yeah, I'm sorry. Um... is he okay? He's... he's safe and sound. Good. Oh, my gosh, how did he get all the way to Boston? I rescue pets from shelters all over the east coast and bring them back here and find homes for them. Oh. Ms. Brown, buddy has been adopted out to a forever family. But he's-he's my dog. He's been my dog for five years. Yeah, I-I understand. I know how difficult this must be for you, but... No, you... I'm his owner. I don't... I don't get calls like this very often, so I'm going to need to see his registration papers. I don't have registration papers for him. My husband found him overseas, and brought him back home. I can give you those papers. I'll do anything it takes, I just would like to bring my dog home. Okay, I'm going to need to get in touch with the family, and I need to warn you, this may not be as easy as you think. I'll get back to you as soon as I've talked to the family. Bye. Where's Emma? I sent her out to walk buddy. So, what's the word? Her papers check out. In all the years I have rescued dogs, I have never had this happen. What am I going to say to Emma? I mean, she's been through enough for somebody twice her age. This is going to break her heart. I know. This woman would like to meet with you. How do you want to handle it? "Dear Greene family, "I'm writing to you about the most amazing dog, "but then you probably know that by now. "We had a huge thunderstorm here last month, "and it damaged our fence. "When buddy got out and ran away, "I was devastated. "He's been my companion, my muse, and my best friend ever since my husband died two years ago." "He was originally Dylan's dog, and they were inseparable. "My husband survived three deployments overseas "without so much as a scratch, "only to come home and have a heart attack "while he was out jogging. "For my son and me, "buddy is our last connection to him. "Please find it in your heart "to let him come home for Christmas. Sincerely, Sally brown." Buddy, come on! Hello? Hello, my name is Mark Greene, I'm calling about buddy. Hi, um, how is he? Is he okay? Oh, yeah, he's doing just fine. Good. Good, uh, good... Thank you so much for, uh, getting back to me. I wasn't, um... Wasn't sure that you would, Mr. Greene, so, thank you so much. I, uh, I've just, I've been really very worried about him, and-and thank god you and your family took him in. Um... This may seem a little odd, I want to make sure that this is my dog, my buddy. Well, didn't Greta confirm with you? Yes, I know, I just want to be certain, if that makes any sense. Well, um, I could try and get a picture to you. My daughter's taken quite a few. Okay. I would appreciate that very much. Sure. Would it be too much to ask if I could come and see him? I just live an hour away in warm Springs, and I could drive down in a moment's notice, if that would be okay. Um, you know, I'm just, I'm just not sure about that. I don't mean to intrude, but... You know what, I'm just going to be candid with you here. My daughter's been through a lot over the last little while. She lost her mother two years ago, and I am, uh... Well, I feel hesitant to make any decisions without talking to her about it. I'm trying to take care of my girl. Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Good night. Em? There you go. There's something we gotta talk about. Your aunt came by yesterday with some news. Buddy's owner has surfaced. What do you mean? We're his owner. There's a woman in warm Springs... Nobody's taking buddy away from me. I think you should read this. He's our dog. I know, and I've been wrestling with this all night, but we have to do the right thing. There is no right thing, dad. No matter what we do, somebody's going to get hurt. I feel sorry for this woman, I really do... Look, she's got a history with the dog. It was her husband's. We've only had him for two weeks. She just wants to come and see him. She wants to take him, doesn't she? Hey... Em... Sally? Yeah. Uh, Mark? Yeah. Hi. Please, come in. Thank you. I, uh, I was a half hour early, so I've just been driving around the block in circles. He sure likes his toys. Yeah, you should see my house. It looks like a pet shop exploded. He likes to play hockey with the pillows. Oh, yeah. Yeah... Uh... So, uh, is he here? Actually, Emma just took for a walk. He was full of all kinds of anxious energy this morning, so... It was like he knew. Oh, yeah, trust me, he knew. That dog knows everything. They'll be back in a minute. Can I offer you anything? A glass of water or something? That would be nice, thank you. You have a beautiful home. You should have seen it before we moved in. My daughter thought I'd lost my mind. Ah, thank you. Well, it looks like you've done a lot of work. It's beautiful. Yeah, we were stripping wood for weeks. The kitchen demo was a nightmare. We were washing our dishes in the tub there for about a month. Sorry. That sounds like my husband, Dylan. Every weekend, it was a new project. Go away on an errand, come home, and the bathroom was demolished or the wall was missing... Just on a whim, you know? You guys and your power tools always trying to fix the world. Okay, let's do the other side again, ready? Good... Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Can I..? Oh, yeah. Buddy? Buddy! Come here! Hi, buddy! Here, come here, buddy. Come here. Hi, buddy... Okay... Come here. Go get it. He looks really healthy, like nothing's even happened. Yeah, well, he wasn't eating much when he got here, but he's turned into a bit of a chow hound now. Have you had him since he was a pup? My husband found him outside of his barracks in Beirut on Christmas morning, had no idea where he came from, or how old he was, so we just decided that Christmas day would be his birthday. Buddy's a lucky dog. How often does an animal find two loving homes in one lifetime, right? Sometimes, they don't find one. Hey, em, you're kind of quiet. You got any questions? Not really. A photographer, huh, is that what you are? It's just a hobby for now. Her mother was a freelance photographer for "Manhattan style and living magazine." This was her camera. Do you shoot color or black and white? Black and white. Ooh, a purist. You shoot in color, and you get pictures of people's clothing. Black and white, more of a picture into their soul. You're lucky, not everybody has an artist's eye like that. Are you here to take him home? Em... It's all right. You know what, Emma, I, uh... First I just wanted to make sure that he was... He was healthy and safe... And you guys are taking good care of him, which you are. The three of us are just going to talk about it, okay? Dad, can I be excused? Of course. I guess the three of us are not going to talk about it. I can't even imagine what she's going through. Sally. Yeah. Honestly, I don't know how we're going to reconcile this. She's had to shoulder a lot over the last two years, and I don't really feature hurting her more. I-I hear you. I get it. It's just, uh... How about we... How about we talk in a few days? Is that doable? Yeah. Okay. Hey, buddy. Paw? You be a good boy, okay? This isn't goodbye. Okay? I love you, buddy. You have my cell and my home phone number, and my email, okay? Yeah, yeah, I got it. I, uh, I'd like to say goodbye to your daughter, if I could? Yeah. Hey, em! Why don't you come out? Sally's leaving. I just wanted to say thank you. Thank me? I didn't do anything. Well, you took in a stranger when he needed a home not a lot of people have a heart as big as that. So, thank you so much. Buddy, come! Good boy, you go inside with Emma. You're good with kids. I've had a bit of practice, I write children's books, too. You're, uh... You're "the" Sally brown. Yeah, I guess... You could say that. It didn't click until just now. It didn't click we have most of them inside.W. We have most of them inside. Oh, no kidding? My wife used to read them. To Emma. Wow, that's great, thanks for letting me know. I appreciate it. Buddy will be okay, all right? Yeah, I know. I know he will. It's just me. I, uh... Thank you very much for letting me come by. I appreciate it. That's fine. Take care. They're good people, and they're taking very good care of buddy. That must have been awkward. Yeah, I kind of felt like an intruder in their home. Legally, they can keep him, right? Yeah. I mean, it's all up to Mark. He's a single dad. Handsome. He's a good man, you can tell it in his eyes. Did I mention that he was good-looking? I haven't heard you talk about someone like this for a long time. It's like you like him. Oh, please. I was just kidding. I really haven't given it any thought. I just want him to give my dog back. Do you trust him? What, with buddy? With everything. I just pray that he makes the right decision. So, what happens next? I really don't know. There's no manual on how to deal with a mess like this. She was very sweet to Emma, though. I appreciated that. She's actually a children's book author? Oh. Self-published? No, she's, uh, she's big-time. Oh. You know, buddy's mom is famous in that world. Emma couldn't believe it. Well, that's cool. What's she like? She's very pretty. She seems like a nice woman. It would have been a heck of a lot easier if she'd have been awful, you know. You're being awfully brave. About what? You fell in love with that dog the minute you saw him, and now... This woman wants to take him away? What are you gonna do, right? Hey, Emma. Jacob? Awesome dog. Can I pet him? Sure. Buddy's super friendly. I've always wanted a dog like this. My mom's a cat person. Have you started your paper for Mrs. Wallace's class yet? "My best Christmas ever?" It feels like an assignment for third-graders. Besides, hasn't everything already been written about Christmas? Between dickens and Dr. Seuss? I'm focusing more on my book report for her. It's a bigger part of our grade anyway. Whatever. See you guys around. Come on, buddy. Emma! Don't pay attention to those nimrods. I'm reading "to kill a mockingbird." I love Harper Lee. My dad has a first edition. Someday, I'm going to get Atticus Finch glasses. They'd look cool on you. Thanks. Well, see you around. I had the coolest thing happen in town today. Mm-hmm? I ran into some kids from school. There's this cool kid, Jacob. I didn't even know he knew my name, but he started talking to me, all because of buddy. Well, good things happen with that dog around, right? Have you talked from that lady? Sally? What are we going to do, dad? I feel sorry for her, but buddy's a part of our family now. I don't know, hon'. I don't have the answers. I wish that I did. You know, you and I will have to work it out together. So... Tell me about this boy. Hey, what's up, partner? Huh? What are you doing? Oh, what a great dog. What's his name? Buddy. I love Shepherds, they're the best dogs ever, right? Can I pet him? Yeah, go ahead. He'll be your friend for life. So, uh, where are you guys from? Santa's village up on main. We're Santa's helpers. We like to have lunch once in a while and compare our war stories. Well, I'll tell you what, the coffee's on the house for all the work you guys do this time of year. You knew exactly what you were doing, didn't you, buddy? I should change the name of this joint to buddy's. Hi, you've reached Mark. Please leave a message after the tone. What are we going to do, buddy? Hmm? What are we gonna do... Emma... It's time to get ready for bed. I had the best dream about mom. Yeah? I dream about her all the time. I'm glad we have these pictures. She lived for the holidays. She had a very generous spirit. Remember how she used to bake cookies for everybody in the neighborhood? Even the people she didn't know. Yeah. She'd know what to do, dad. About what? Buddy. I've been thinking about it a lot. I have this paper due, "my best Christmas ever." Then a thought came, what if my best Christmas ever hasn't happened yet? Well, what would be your best Christmas? To have you and me and mom together for Christmas, as a family again, but I know that can't happen for us. But it can for buddy. Buddy has a chance to go home. He needs to be with his mom for Christmas. That would be "his best Christmas ever." That's the most beautiful gift that you could give him. I couldn't be more proud of you. I know your mother would be, too. All right, you, uh, you get ready for bed. I'm going to miss that sound. There you go, come on. Buddy! Hi! Hi! Hey. Thank you so much. This means the world to me, Emma. It really does. Thank you. Good boy, come here. Give it to me. Oh, yeah... Dad, that's just like he does at home. Yeah? He could do this for hours. You leave that outside. Good boy. -After you. -Thank you. It smells like a bakery in here. Oh, yeah? I'm getting ready to send a shipment of some care packages over to the troops. My son is stationed in Afghanistan. I'll take your coats. I was in the reserves. There's nothing quite like getting a care package from home. I'm sure your son feels the same way. I pray for the day when he gets back, that way, I'll have both my boys at home. Right, buddy? Uh, well, can I get you guys anything? Some hot chocolate maybe? Does that sound good? Yeah. Can I give you a hand? I would love that. Do me a favor, Emma, and keep buddy out of these boxes. There are cookies in there, and he's got a sweet tooth. You know, you needn't have gone to all this trouble. Oh, no, no, it's absolutely my pleasure. It's the least I could do. I mean, I really honestly could have picked up buddy. Well, truthfully, we wanted to see where buddy lives, just to know that we'd done the right thing, but I can see we did. Well, I'm glad you think that. So, what can I do? Uh... Well, you could sift the cocoa, I guess? I can do that. Okay. Ah, a molinillo. I don't think I've ever met anyone who knows what that crazy thing is. Well, we sell a lot of hot chocolate at this time of year at the shop. Oh, yeah, right. I read somewhere that the Mayans considered the molinillo to be a magical instrument. They believed that the "spirit of the drink" was in the froth. Really? Good manners and well read, no wonder buddy likes you. Yeah, he really appreciates the well-read part. Uh, excuse me, I need the... Excuse me, sorry. Not at all. I haven't had a man in the kitchen helping me out in a long time. I find that hard to believe. It's true. No dating? Well, seems like a very strange word. No, there... There hasn't been anybody. No, I kind of feel like that part of me is... Is lost. If that makes any sense. Yeah, I mean, uh, I've heard stories of this happening to people, but, you know, you never think it's going to happen to you. No. Yeah, nothing in the world could have prepared me for this. But, um, what am I talking about? I'm rambling. That's what happens when you live alone for a really long time. It's okay. Uh, we're ready for the milk? I believe we are. Nice and warm. Great. Sorry. Oh, right. Yeah. I'm sorry. I just didn't know I was going to get a floor show. Yeah, it's professional hazard, you know? It's a little thing I do for Emma at work. Oh, yeah, that's... Yeah, your sister, Greta, told me that you have a coffee shop. Yeah. Yeah, "serious brew." We offer a little bit of razzle dazzle, a little bit of Fosse with every drink. It embarrasses the heck out of Emma. Well, we live to embarrass our kids. Exactly, right? Or at least they think that until they have children of their own. Phew, it is hot in here. I forgot to turn off the fire on the stove. Are we good? Yeah. And this is buddy's favorite napping spot, otherwise known as my studio. Wow, and look at all these capaldi book awards. Can I have Emma up to have a look at them? She's an avid reader, thanks to your books. She'd be blown away. Yeah, absolutely. Great. Emma, why don't you come up here and see this? I have "James in wonderland." Oh, yeah? I made mom read it to me about 10,000 times. Probably more. Buddy comes from a famous family. Yeah, well, he's going to be the star of my next book, too. Oh, yeah? What's it about? It's about how buddy brings good luck wherever he goes. Yeah? I don't really have the whole story yet because it's been a little difficult to write with him not being here, but he's back, and so I think that the end is forthcoming. Well, you've certainly captured his essence here. Thanks. Have you got a title? Oh, no. Inspiration has yet to strike. Any suggestions? What about, "buddy's most excellent adventure?" I love it. Or, uh... "Buddy, the Christmas Shepherd?" Dad, that's great. I like that. That's actually really good. It's a perfect play on words. Thank you, Mark. Dad used to work in advertising. Oh, yeah, did he? What's an ad man doing owning a coffee house? Ah, it's a long story, but maybe that's better for another time, actually. It's a school night, so we should probably get going. Well, there you go. The tour. Life imitates art. Kind of. Come. I've been dreading this all day, huh? Yeah. I can't thank you enough. You've given me the best Christmas present imaginable. Could we come and visit? Absolutely. Anytime you want, that door is always open, okay? Bye, buddy. I'm going to miss you. Hey, how you doing, pal? See you. Come on, sweetheart. Yeah. You okay? I don't know what it is about Sally, I feel like I've always known her. How so? Maybe it's from reading her books since I was a kid. Like meeting a pen pal. I can see that. She's a remarkable woman. We're never seeing them again, are we? I don't know, hon'. I don't want them to go either. Come on. Come on. A comb through the hair, young lady? Dad, I can't find my iPad anywhere. It has my notes for my book report on it, and it's due this week. Okay, did you, uh, did you take it with you yesterday? Maybe leave it in the car, or at Sally's? I did my homework in the car. I don't remember that much. I was such a mess. I'm sorry, dad, I messed up. Don't worry about it, we'll find it, all right? Grab your stuff. Let's go. Hey, Graham? Guess what? He's back. Yeah, yeah, he's home. He's healthy and happy and it's all good. Up to his old tricks. Yeah, I absolutely will get you what I have before you go away for Christmas. Yeah, I'm just happy to be writing again. I have to call you back, Graham. Buddy, what are you into? What is this? Uh, Graham, I'm going to have to call you back. Okay, all right. I'll speak to you soon. Bye. Hello. Hey, Mark, it's Sally brown. You're never going to guess what I found under the tree this morning. If I was to hazard a guess I would say that you found Emma's tablet? Yes! I have no idea how it got there. Buddy found it. Actually, we've been running around all morning in a dither looking for it. She's got a book report that's due on Friday. And it's on that thing. Oh, no, I'm so sorry. Well, listen, I could email the report, or even drop it by if you want. Oh, I don't want you to go to that kind of trouble. Oh, come on, after all you've done, of course I can. All right, I'll tell you what, make you a deal. Perhaps we could meet half way? There's a wonderful little Christmas market in framingham. What do you say? 7:00 at the coffee kiosk? Sounds good, I'm looking forward to it. Yeah, me too. Thanks. Okay, we'll see you later then. Bye. â™ª Oh, holy night â™ª the stars are brightly shining â™ª You're a Saint for doing this. Emma wanted me to tell you that you had, quote, "saved her life." I'm happy to help out, really. And how's buddy doing? Oh, back to his old tricks. Same old routine. Yeah. I know this was hard for you and Emma, and... I wish there was a way we could... Give him a scratch. Tell him we miss him. Absolutely. Every chance I get. This coffee's all right for a kiosk. You can taste the smokiness. I taste black coffee. Okay... All right, it's like that, right? You got to let it sit on your palate. You know, allow the bouquet to come to life. Inhale... You know? I'm not much of a connoisseur, so you lost me on that one. Try my double mocha latte blanco milkshake, it'll make you a believer. I think I can hear the commercial jingle right now. Well, sounds decadent, but the next time I'm in waltham, I'm going to expect a life-changing coffee experience, please. I'll do my best to deliver. Shall we sit? Yeah. Why did you leave Madison Avenue? Uh, well... I was doing well there, work-wise... Really well, I guess, but after Lauren died, I just decided that "really well" wasn't enough. So, I quit my job, and I wanted em to be close to my family in Boston, so I moved here. So, you know, you asked me this the other day, and I'm going to ask you, have, uh, are you dating again? Well, with moving from New York, and trying to start a new business, and Emma, I... No. You know, it just... Dating takes a lot of time. Oh, my goodness, and it's so much work. Seriously, I don't even know why we do it anymore. No, they should ban it. It's nice to talk to someone who understands what I'm talking about. You fall in love, and you get married... Not to be naive, but you assume that you're going to be with that person forever. I used to love to ice skate. Oh, yeah? You wouldn't catch me dead out there, not this guy. Really? Yeah. Arms out to your side. This was a terrible idea, Sally. No, it's a great idea. Put your right foot behind you at a 60-degree angle, and push off with the inside of that edge. Right there, like that. And I'm going to do all of this at the same time? All of it at the same time. All at the same time. You know, interestingly enough, I was born without a center of gravity. And thus, I cannot skate. And I cannot dance, and cannot ski. Sounds like a horrible life. I got you, don't worry. You're fine, doing good. You're beautiful, you know that? Stop, you're silly. Oh! Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? You know what? That's what happens when you say silly things. It's nice down here. No, no, no, you gotta get up. There's other skaters. It's rude, you've got to get off the ice. All right. Okay, all right. Ooh, sorry. We almost bonked heads. Okay, you know, we're going to go to the outside track now. I don't think that's a very good idea. No, it's a great idea. One loop, all the way around. No crashes, no falls, no accidents, and nobody gets hurt, and stop making me laugh, it's distracting. Hey, kid. Hey. Yes! Yeah... yeah, Sally said she hopes you get an "a" on your report. I will now. Perfect. Dad, you're limping. Yeah, why don't you mind your own business. Against my better judgment, I allowed myself to be convinced that I should go ice skating with Sally last night. You went ice skating? I went ice skating. Sally got you on the ice? She did, she got me on the ice. Might have went down a few times. I don't believe it. Believe it. She is, uh, also going to come over for a drink tomorrow night. She's bringing buddy. Yes, buddy. But, dad, you just saw her yesterday. Why's she coming over? Well, we had a... You know, we had a good time, so we thought it might be fun, right? Good job, dad. Good job for what, em? Oh, you're a funny kid. You're really funny. Buddy, come here! Hi, Emma! He's been so excited about this all day. Hey, Mark, you're limping. What's going on? You did this to me. You're a terrible person. I what? Oh, from ice skating, are you kidding me? I don't know how you did it. I've been trying to get my dad to go skating with me since I was little. Yeah? Well, he showed great potential, but he's got a lot of work to do. Know what I'm sayin'? Potential. Um, guys, I hate to tell you this, but you do know that Christmas is just a little bit away. You couldn't put up a papier-mache angel? From fresh crepe, maybe, a little something? No, I've been on her case for about three weeks now to get a tree. Oh, yeah? We've been busy... Well, I gotta tell ya, you happen to be in the presence of the best Christmas tree shopper in the world. Is that right? Mm-hmm. Is there anything that you're not good at? No, no, no, no, not me. Buddy over there. Mm-hmm, I promise you, he will pick out the best Christmas tree on the lot. Now, mind you, it will be the most expensive. Dad, sorry about that, but he's got champagne taste. I don't know. Come on. Why not, right? Why don't we go get ourselves some holiday cheer? Yeah! Bring your camera, too. I bet you get some great pictures. Okay. Human drama at its best, right? Yeah, let's do it. Come on, pal. It's kind of amazing that you got her to do this. I remember not wanting to put up a tree, or celebrate anything, actually. So, what are the chances of us convincing you to join us for dinner? Oh, I've got a big shipment of care packages going out early in the morning, but thank you. Maybe another time? Oh, I think we may have gotten something. No way. This is way too expensive. I know it's beautiful, and I love this blue spruce, too, but... No... buddy, no! Can somebody help me? You okay? Yeah. Jacob, what are you doing here? It's my uncle's lot. I help out after school. Hey, buddy? You want this one? No way, my dad would freak if he saw the price tag. It's one of the nicest trees on the lot. Just came in from Vermont, I think it might be on hold for a customer. Sorry, buddy. We'll find something else. I don't see a "hold" tag. Maybe they canceled. It's okay. No, it's a beautiful tree, em. You've got great taste. Do you want to see if they could cut you a deal? Sure. Buddy's going to drive me crazy. I stopped by study hall the other day looking for you. You did? I was in the gym watching them set up for the Christmas dance, and... That stuff usually doesn't get to me, but I started thinking about going. Oh, uh, you'll have a great time. I mean... With you. All good on this side! Good. Hey, buddy. All right. Good to meet you, Jacob. Thanks. Thanks, Mr. Greene. Emma, I'll send you a text about the dance. Okay. -See you. -Bye. Emma, he's cute. Buddy, come on! Come on, buddy! Up! Atta boy. Good boy, buddy. Good boy. I know, right? Nothing like a live tree, huh? My dad really likes you. What? No, it's buddy. No one can resist falling head over heels for that dog. No, he lights up when he's around you. Okay. I think we can get this thing through the front door. All right, let's do this. Okay, watch out, honey. Want to grab the front end here? The top, I guess. All right, okay. Oh, buddy... This is a good one! What are you doing? Oh, my god... okay. You be traffic cop there, Emma. Okay. All right, where are we going? To the right. To the what, to the right? No, to the left! Your left, the other left. This is... Oh, it's not gonna... I think this was an ill-conceived plan. Maybe we should take it through the kitchen door? No, I think it'll be okay. You know, I do this every year. Let's take the back in first, right? Here, we got it? Come on out. All right, there we go. Okay, here we go. Let's stuff it in there. I think we got it this time. Here we go. Here we go. Okay, a little bit to the right. Gotta go to the right, gotta go to the right. Go to the right. Loosen it up there, baby, loosen it up, em. To the right, to the right. How we doing? Could it be good now? Yeah. Is it good? Okay. Can I come out? You good? He likes that I'm done down there. -Yeah? -I think that's good. Come? Good boy. You heading out? Yeah. Yeah, I think you guys got it. Looks good. I'll walk you out. Okay, bye, em. Bye. Good boy. We have said goodbye an awful lot for two people who just met. Yeah. I just, I've got to get home, I've got that shipment in the morning, so... Well, when do you figure we'll see you again? Uh, well, I'm really racing a deadline on my book. The editor in Boston wants me to have a rough draft by Christmas, so I'm sure I'll be swamped. Buddy, come. He's looking pretty comfortable there. Yeah, he never does this. Hey... I know, buddy, but we've got to go home. We've got to go home. Buddy, come. Come. Buddy, come here. Ah, ah, I don't know where you're going hey. Here, bud. Go on, up you go. It's like he didn't want to go. Well, maybe he's... Been confused. All this, your house, my house, and back and forth. Ah, he's just having a good time, and he doesn't want to go. Isn't that right, buddy? So you're going to be back in town to see your editor, is that right? Uh, maybe on the 23rd, yeah. Oh, well, that's the same night as Emma's dance. If you're around, maybe come by for a drink. I'm sure going to need one by the time I get her out the door, you know? It's her first dance. Yeah, well, I'll, uh, I'll see how my schedule goes. -All right. -Sounds good. Yeah. Take care. See you, buddy. Hey, scooch over, I'm driving, buddy. Well, why don't you just admit that you really like him. Not too much change, okay? I just, I want to look like myself. Know what, just let me do my thing. Okay? So, what are you so afraid of? I don't know. When we were decorating the Christmas tree, I just, I just felt like I'm not... I'm not ready, I don't know. Ready for, I don't know, some happiness in your life? It felt as if... I was instantly a part of their family, boom, just like that, and-and I just feel like that's... It scared me, okay? Yeah, it scared me. It's too much, too soon. Mark is... He's the first guy that I've had any kind of feelings for since... Yeah, but you know what, getting cold feet is not a really big deal. It just means you're feeling something, and that's a good thing, right? Yes, he's a... Mark is a good guy. He's a very good guy. Look, you want to see Mark again, and you want to look nice, and... Now that buddy's home, there's nothing standing in your way. It's time to start living again. It's just a really big step. Well, it's not a marriage proposal, and you're not buying a house together. Uh, all you're saying "yes" to is a cup of coffee. It's a milkshake. He's a milkshake kind of guy. Okay... Even better. Dad! Yeah? If you call Jacob and tell him I'm sick, I'll do the dishes for a year. Though that is a very enticing offer, I'm going to have to decline. He's early! Tell him I have food poisoning. Tell him I ran away! Hey, Sally. Hey, buddy. Come on in. Come on in, I wasn't expecting you. -Is it okay? -Yeah, of course. Good. Phew! Excuse the chaos here. Emma's still getting ready. Oh, good, she's still here. I was just downtown with my editor. Oh, that's right. Did you finish the book? Ah, well, I gave him the final draft, so I hope he likes it. That's great. Did they cancel the dance because of the storm? Not yet. Hi, Emma. Are you almost ready? Uh, no, but hopefully I will be within the next four years. Hmm, well, we won't keep you long. Buddy and I wanted to bring you and your dad something for Christmas, and I've given it a lot of thought. I don't think I'll ever be able to thank you enough for what you did. Can I open it now, or should we wait till Christmas tomorrow morning? Go ahead. Oh, just tear into it. Get it. The bow is... Ah, there we go. Oh... Wow, it's beautiful. It's the original, we can't accept that. Well, you know, the publisher's got a copy of it. The original belongs here. Well, thank you. Especially because I couldn't have finished it without you. Well, we will hang it in a place of honor. Over the fireplace, dad, that way, we can see it every day. All right. Why don't we do it now? All right. Got it? Can you bring the other one down? Yeah. All right. Okay. Let's hope it fits. Yeah. -Does it? -Oh, there we go. It does. It's beautiful. It looks great. If he shows up early, can you guys stall him? This could take a while. Well, Rome wasn't built in a day, kid. Know what, dad, that is so not comforting. That is not what I... I did not mean... Poor thing, it's her first dance. Mine was a disaster in crimson taffeta, I gotta be honest. Can I get you anything? You want an eggnog? Sure. Yeah? All right. That'd be great. Your tree... The tree looks beautiful! Thanks! Oh, no, this is not happening! Uh, would you like me to look in on her? You know, that would... That would be great. Yeah. Hey, em? Uh, permission to enter? Uh, sure. Hey... Can you use an extra set of hands? I wish I was tall like you. I'm not tall. Bet you're going to be taller than I am someday anyway, and you know what, tall is highly overrated, and a quick fix. You know how? What are you wearing? Um, I'm wearing this. Perfect, I love it. That'll be gorgeous, nice and colorful. Alright. Where's your shoe closet? Shoe closet? Every self-respecting woman has a shoe closet. What have we got going over here? Let's see... Wow! Yours seems to have exploded. Alright, what have we got here? Too summery. Sneakers. Not dressy enough. Cowboy boots? Do we wanna do cowboy boots? No, I don't think so. Oh, how about these? Those are adorable. -Those would go, right? -Yeah. You can dance in those? Yeah, I can. Those will go great. Give you an inch or so. Okay. All right. And how about this... Why don't we go into the bathroom and, I don't know, lose those curlers. What do you say? Losing the curlers and trying something different. That sound good? All right. Your hair looks nice. You think so? My sister talked me into it. I'm not very adventurous, but I'm working on it, you know? Okay, maybe if we try a little up-do? What do you say? Try that? You twist it around a little bit, and put it up with a little bit of something coming down. What do you think? If you can do it, then I can, too. All right, you got a deal. Maybe if we put a pretty flower or a pin in there, what do you say? -Okay. -Okay. Ooh, how about that one? That one's pretty. It was my mom's. Well, perfect then. Who is that girl? I don't know her. Sure, you do. She's been there all along, she just needed a little coaxing. -Let's try it. -Okay. Is that my little girl? Dad, you're embarrassing me. You look like your mother. Thank you. Where did you find that? It was in mom's jewelry box. Is it okay that I'm wearing it? Of course. Nothing would make me happier. Is that a family heirloom? When Lauren and I were first married, I was deployed to Germany, and it was during the holidays, so I wanted to get her something for Christmas. Then I sent her that. She always used to wear it this time of year. Well, it couldn't be more perfect, could it? That would be your gentleman caller there. Okay, shh, keep it cool, play it cool, play it cool. How you doing, Jacob. -Good, how are you? -Not bad. How are the roads out there? It's coming down really hard. The plows are already out. That's quite an eyeful you're wearing there. My mother was horrified when I found it in the attic. She had to have two glasses of chardonnay. But wait, there's more... Wow. All right, come on in then. Shh. Wow. You look... Unbelievable, em. Thanks, Jacob. You too. We should probably get going. Uh, wait, a photo opportunity. This is a moment, this occasion. We need to get a picture. Stand over there before you get out of here, escape. Let me get my picture-taking thing. Okay, let's, uh... We all say "Rudolph the red-nosed German Shepherd!" "Rudolph, the red-nosed German Shepherd!" Nice. What about you, Sally? Oh, no, no, no, we're just visiting. Come on. You're practically part of the family. Come on. -Will you take the picture? -No pictures... Ah, come on, come on. All right, well, buddy, you've got to be in it, too. Come here. Come here, buddy. Come on, come on, buddy. Yeah, come. Come and sit. You come and sit. You sit... Good boy. Sally, could you move a bit closer to Mr. G.? Sure. Closer. Oh, come on, get the shot there, ansel Adams. All right, there we go. You guys go. I love you. You have fun. You guys have a good time. I will. Thank you, dad. -Bye, em. -Bye. Don't forget your jacket, sweetheart. I won't. Okay. They look so cute, don't they? Okay, well, she's off, and it's late, so... You want to stick around and have a cup of tea, or... No, no, no, that's okay. We...with the weather like this, we should get going. You know, you can stay if you'd like. We have a guest room. Emma and I can make you breakfast in the morning. That's, uh... We-we couldn't impose. It's no imposition. It's fine, and besides, big red, you know, he's gotten us through worse, so, uh... Buddy! Where are you? Okay, go, buddy. Careful there. Whoa... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Buddy, buddy, buddy, come! Come on! The snow is throwing him off. Whoa! You okay? Yeah, I'm good. Come on, pal. Good boy. Up! Up, up, up. Good boy. Good boy, buddy. You... You feel this, right? I mean, I'm not alone in this, am I? No, but I'm not 18 anymore, and I'm not good at this. Either am I. I just need to go slow. Yeah. â™ª On an ice floe â™ª something's melting below â™ª â™ª when must I let go â™ª all the snowflakes â™ª crystal signature love â™ª sent from up above... â™ª And I'm lost without you... Okay, buddy, it's okay. It's okay, buddy, it's okay. Pop the hood... You stay. You don't want to come out here. Hello? Hi, Mark, it's Sally. I'm so sorry to be calling, but, um, I've got a bit of an emergency. Where are you? Are you okay? We are at ninth and main. Buddy and I are fine. We're fine, it's just, it's, uh... It's the truck. Okay, I'll, uh, I'll come find you. Okay. Thank you. You stay. No, no, you stay. I can't believe it. I think it's electrical, and everything is closed because of the storm, so maybe you could take us to a hotel? Are you crazy? I'm not going to take you to a hotel. Well... I... I shouldn't have left again. I... I panicked, I'm sorry. I just still feel frozen inside. Look... There's a reason we met. Out of all the lost dogs and rescue shelters in the world, somehow, we found each other. I'm going to take you home. Both of you. Okay. Come on, let's get him. Come on, buddy. I had a great time tonight, Jacob. You were the prettiest girl there, em. Merry Christmas, Jacob. You too. Hey, kid. Buddy? What are you guys doing here? Well, big red finally gave up the ghost on me, so, uh, we're just going to hang here tonight. That okay? Are you kidding? Absolutely! We found the star. -Want to put it up? -Sure. How was the dance? How was it? We want details. Was he a gentleman, I hope? Yes, he was a gentleman. Good. We had a great time. We danced every dance. Every dance. Slow dances, fast dances? All of the above. Wow... There's a bunch of presents down here for you. I don't know... But this has my name on it. It does?
