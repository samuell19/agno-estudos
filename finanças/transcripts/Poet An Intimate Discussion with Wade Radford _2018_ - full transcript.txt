Something that I've kind of learned to own and, maybe that I kind of like as well, is that, obviously, I am no a-- I'm no A-list or anything. Mostly you speak to most people and they go, "Who? Who the fuck's that?" But every time I seem to do an interview, a radio show or something, I seem to always-- Within the first sentence of introducing me, I seem to be... The word "underground" comes up. So I guess that makes me maybe an underground filmmaker at times. That makes me maybe an underground poet at times. Ehm... I kind of always say to people I'm a jack of all trades and master of none really. I'll give anything a bash. [laughs] But I don't know, and these are the people who said to me in the past, you know, "What do you want us to put in the articles? Writer?" Am I a writer? Am I? No, maybe not. I scribble my thoughts down and some people buy it and some people enjoy it and some people hate it. Does that actually make me a writer or a poet? I suppose that's in the eye of the beholder, isn't it? You got someone over here that's enjoying the poetry and they're going, "Oh, I love that poet Wade, whoever that is." Uhm... You know, so he to me is a poet. And then you got other people that might hate my work and they go, "Can't write for shit." It's maybe what people say. And you know, you know with all the years we've worked together there's some people that go, "They're underground filmmakers because they make controversial underground films." And there're some people that go, "Wade Radford, what a fucking joke." You know, we've got the people that see us like that and then the other people wouldn't pay us the blindest bit of attention because we're tapping into things that they either want to deny or that they don't like or it wasn't made in a way that... they feel it should have been made. So, to them, we're not worthy of being filmmakers. In all honesty, my poetry books don't sell in massive volumes. It's my favorite piece of all that I do. So I do it more for the love than any money that I make off of it, because when all is said and done, the money left from it is keeps me in red wine for a while... [laughs] but it's not a lot. But I love doing it. And to me, the people that buy the poetry are the ones that really follow me and support me. They are the ones that really understand me. But also before I go and call myself a poet or a writer, maybe I'm not. I know I'm honest with what I do and I know that I always tell it as it is in poetry, no matter how dark it is. But say I hadn't been "Wade Radford" and I'd just been "Jay" and I'd never made a film, would I have ever sold a copy of a poetry book? Because they're-- it's such a niche market anyway. So, would I have ever sold a copy? Probably not. ♪ Flack, I never existed ♪ You can't drown yourself in a bath I just seem to keep floating and flowing with the stream If I turn on my front I can just lose oxygen and then float lifelessly But they say you can't drown yourself in a bath I just seem to float just carried by the tide Every little piece of me has succumbed and died But they do say you can't get anywhere unless you try As I float you seem to float behind me No matter how much I try to paddle the stream to get away Why do you float behind me still?

Started out with Sex, Lies & Depravity, originally titled Jake , and ended up going through a crazy journey of the Boys Behind Bars trilogy, Twink, Necrophiliac: The Lustful Dead, Fluid Boy , to name a few. I've had quite a journey with Wade over the last six years. And catching up with him again highlighted many issues that have always interested me with this troubled and complex individual. So I was approached to spend a week with Wade to get to know the real him, what really is going on behind that head of his. Well, most people know Wade as being a collaborator with me and being the star of quite a large variety of underground LGBT films. He's also a poet which is something he takes a lot of pride in, and something that I knew but wanted to delve deeper into. Some of our film work has inspired his poetry, as well as tragic life events. And after catching up again with Wade, we decided that it'll be a good idea to actually go on a journey and him to confront his past, present and, possibly, future demons. Ad to make a stand, once and for all and to kind of get out in the open who he really is rather than hiding behind his work. For the first time, he's going to let people in to see the real him and what's really going on inside his head. My autograph actually devalues items. [laughter] You've got, like, the DVD or the book and it will sell for like its right amount of money. And then I sign it and it devalues. It's awful. It's like I never existed Like I was never there It's like our eyes never locked Never held a glare It's like I never mattered I didn't ever exist It's like we never met lips Like we never kissed It's like I never held you when the world crumbled It's like between the sheets we never made love nor fumbled It's like the words of promise were never ever said It's like the tears of happiness were never ever shed It's like I never stood there And saw you smile across the room It's like you never promised We'd stand strong from life to tomb It's like we never hit the road and left reality behind It's like we never shared the secrets That swam from our minds It's like we never promised vows that one day would be shared It's like your love for me Was never once said and declared It's like the first time never happened That intense electric It's like literal surprises never happened before they became expected It's like I never rocked your world That time when you fell deep It's like the faded bruise around my eye's still mine to keep It's like you never said a thing When you published our whirlwind romance It's like I never ever existed Now you've taken a different stance Remember me I'm the one who held you close Remember me I'm the letter and the envelope Remember me The one who behind it was always there Remember me When others treats you equally unfair I probably first heard Jay's work, and heard, rather than saw, his spoken word, his poetry readings on SoundCloud probably would have been the first place that I'd heard any of Jay... do his thing before the writing. I think that's probably what it was. My memory is not what it used to be. I think that comes with age, and... probably my impressions of his poems will be more of the recent work than the older work. And that'd just be because it's fresh in my memory, it's what I remember. I came to know Wade when... ten years ago, through MySpace, originally. And from our initial communication he seemed like a really inspiring person to me. I felt inspired in our communications and gave him my number. And he called and I think the first time we spoke must've lasted about three hours. Talking about the poetry and trying to talk about my favorite pieces is very difficult. You know, it's like saying what's your favorite child. I've liked everything that he's done. But I suppose the one that has the most meaning to me is the poem that he wrote called "Just Words". And it was something that he'd written for me... [hesitating] two years ago, when I was going through some difficulties. And it says as much about him as a person as it does about his talent and how he cares for other people. And I've always, always, always treasured that poem "Just Words." Now, the films I've most enjoyed doing with Wade. That's a tough one because there's a lot of films in quite a short space of time at a particular point. I suppose one hat stands out is Boys Behind Bars original, because it was quite a life changing film for reasons. And I thought it was mad how it was done. It was a concept conceived and done and delivered in a record-breaking time really. And so it worked. It shouldn't have worked and it did. It was just quite phenomenal. So it's a highlight. I certainly look back with a lot of memories at the original Boys Behind Bars . But also looking back, Necrophiliac: The Lustful Dead was a very intimate film of just me and Wade doing it together and that... It stands out. I sometimes think about revisiting that film. There's something quite captivating about that. So this is kind of where me and friends used to spend most of our summers with sheep. [sheeps cleating] Which sounds ominous. But yeah, we used to spend most of the time down here, and this kind of... We used to just sit around this little bit of water and never thinking that it's... kind of public safety gone mad. I keep finding that every time I go back to one of these special places from my life, they seem to have put barbed wire there or some like metal fencing or something, which kind of seems to really ruin the aesthetic as well as, as I said, it's just public safety gone mad. If some people were to drown in a small piece of water, then I suppose that would clean up some statistics really, You know? But these are kind of... This is home and this is... [sheeps cleating] This is really what inspires a lot of what I do, you know, because to me, to be out in the open and to be in a countryside setting, it's always something that's going to remind me of home. So, you know, not like going into cities and stuff like that but this is kind of the inspiration from where, you know, most of what I do comes from. You know, in a lot of the poetry that I've done, I've described-- I've tried to place that image of real sort of quaint countryside settings into it and try and get that message across. Most of the beautiful memories I have, wether they're on my own or with someone else, it was sharing views with, you know, nature really, nice skylines. And that's always important in what I do and that always inspires what I do as well. So it's places like this, really. You know, I do love animals. I have kept a lot of animals myself, rescued a lot of animals over the years. And as I say, being out here, to me, to hear this lovely noise that we're hearing and then imagining it on someone's dinner plate, you know, a couple of hours later it's just something I can't really comprehend. You know, if I had a big place and if I had the time, I would fill it full of animals and have filled it with animals in the past. It is a bit of a calling. Just, you know, even if someone's got a dog, you know, I'm the first to go up and be like, "Can I touch your dog because it's adorable?" you know. So to me they're always members of the family and I can't imagine not being in places like this where, you know, lambs and cows and whatever can roam freely. I mean, to me, that's all a part of the countryside as well. I'm lost I'm not meant to be lost Look how far you've come, they said But I ask at what cost I'm lost Destruction may not rain But I'm lost and I'm lost and I can't win this game I'm lost There's no light in sight I'm hitting walls in the darkness And no passage is bright I'm lost Even though I built a new wall I built it so high that I can't see at all I'm lost Are you lost too? When you feel lost, tell me what do you do I'm lost I don't think I ever recovered So stop looking at me like I need to be mothered I'm lost Just give me the map Mark route A to B and bring me right back I'm lost Will you give me direction? I still feel lost, so are my worth such affection I'm lost And maybe I am bitter I just see mounds upon mounds of memory litter I'm lost I still get the urge, still get the temptation to mount the curb I'm lost Why follow my madness? Especially if you will only turn it to sadness I'm lost Not sure I regained control Just slowly digging deeper into my self-created hole I'm lost You'll find me in hell Still find me wailing in my claustrophobic cell I am lost And the resilience is gone I'm lost, so lost Goodbye, so long I just seen this bit actually, which is kind of interesting because, as I say, even with the barbed-wire fence around the lake when I haven't been here for so many years... It's funny, I keep having experiences in the last few days where I go, "Oh my God, that happened," or whatever. But it's really muddy, so don't worry about coming down. But there's like a piece of concrete just down there like a really random piece of concrete. And that wasn't there. That tree was. But this overgrown bit wasn't there. It was kind of just this tree bit here. It didn't have all this mud and shit. And we just used to sit down on this concrete bits on our coats and everything and we would obviously spend hours here. I don't know, maybe about ten, eleven, twelve years old. And, actually, it's really funny as well, 'cause we used to bring my dad's video camera down here and we'd make our own little shows and whatever. So it's always there, the drama queen within me was present always. So, you know, we'd bring my dad's video camera down, fuck knows what happened to all of that. It would probably be really embarrassing to watch back now. But, yeah, we'd seriously just sit here because you'd get a bit of shade as well. And honestly this field of line I just-- You know, you'd all knock for each other at eight o'clock in the morning or whatever, and then you'd turn up when darkness is setting. And that's kind of-- I think that's kind of the shame of now, you know. Like, you see young children and teenagers and if a mum and dad want to shut him up, they hand him the, you know, the iPad or the controller for the Xbox or the PlayStation. My family couldn't afford all of that stuff when I was-- And it wasn't around and readily available like it was. Of course, you had your, you know, Dreamcast or Nintendo 64, if the finances met or whatever. But growing up in a place like this, you know, there were so many places to go that I never really sat in that much. I never had much of an interest in games consoles. I did like films, but I didn't-- I wouldn't say I watched that many films growing up either. It'll be a case that we'd go round to each other's house eight o'clock in the morning, knock on the doors, you know, collect the friendship group up and then spend days in places like this. Because I love, obviously, the word written but I think... for authors who do have that ability and talent to speak the word, I think it adds a lot to it. And to me, it's just more personal when you can hear someone do their own work. It's special. And Jay does that a lot. And again, SoundCloud a great service that is available on. Wade and I met... It was through Twitter. He had popped up in my feed as somebody to watch or somebody to follow. And so I took a look at his profile and liked what I saw. And so I followed him. And then, not too long after that, because he'd been talking about Twink at the time, I asked doing interview with him for a website that I was writing for. And he said yes and we became good friends from there. And so, you know, I really have all that to thank Twitter or to blame Twitter for. I've watched Wade Radford grow from, you know, from this young kid who was... who had come to know me, I believe, from my early music and... he wanted to use some of that music in some of his films, which was cool with me, because I had already such a great respect for his creativity as a writer, as an actor, as a director, as a poet. I mean... He just always just got to me, you know. He was under my skin. I never wanted to work with anyone as much as I did him. I love that Jay's work covers a wide range of topics. His poetry and spoken word, pretty much any topic you can think of, he covers on, of his life and just the world in general. And to this day I just-- he just never ceases to just surprise and amaze. Sadly, most of that is-- where it comes from is such a painful place. But he's somebody who's not afraid to wear his feelings on the outside, you know. And if that disturbs you, well, that's your problem. But he does wear his heart on his sleeve a lot. And he does-- you know, he's not afraid to express himself in his emotional ways. Can be quite difficult for some people to hear and to take on board but to me it was inspiring. There's this really old soul in this really young man who is just finding his way. And I've watched him grow from that to what he is today, which is this... sensational underground LGBT artist. But not just LGBT, I mean. What he does is... You know, he can turn his hands to anything. And that's one of the things I love about him. Jay does poems on consumerism, the media, porn. There's an ode, a love sonnet to his reptilian companions, co-workers, friends. Obviously works on love, loss, heartache, heartbreak, addictions, the environment, politics. Again, wide-ranging topics. And that's another reason I'm attracted and, like his work is, he doesn't cover just one topic, covers whatever, again... touches him, affects him. And I love that. I think Wade is actually a very talented good artist. He's got some very cool ideas. I think what attracted me to work with Wade in all these films is he was-- he liked taking risks and he dealt with taboo and controversial subjects that a lot of us will run a mile from it. But he pushed to go quite dark and grimy, which attracted me. So I do respect the subjects he tackles. But he also tackles subjects in the LGBT market which I don't really see tackled. I've seen some mundane stuff. And as he said to me earlier, and it's true, there's always the same sort of formula. He kind of put a dark spin on that area which I found interesting because real life is dark at times. So the fact that someone's willing to show the darker side of any area of life, to me that's, you know, I think it hasn't explored. It's not a fairy tale out there and Wade lifts the curtain up sometimes to reveal what life's really like. So I think he's a troubled and challenging artist at times. And that-- it goes together. All great artists have their demons and he expresses his demons through his art, which is kind of what I've done over the years. So I'm on the same wavelength sometimes, I get where he's coming from. So I think that helps us work together, to be honest. Prison I'm in a self-created prison I put me on the ball and chain I made my world so tiny It will never be the same again I've been everybody's inmate I'm on a sentence I fear will be for life Will I be exonerated? Or will I return to the expression expressed with a knife? I'm really losing control My own lows I cannot articulate I'm trying to remember a time when I was the fisherman not the bait I'm sinking down lower to a place those around me have no idea Sometimes it's easier to have that nothing Then loss is not a fear Like the prey hunted upon the Sahara My forts, they twist, they turn, grow darker The line between happy and depressed Has gotten even harder They think I'm having a bad day That I'm feeling pretty low But this is the coming cannonball Not me, not you can control I'm at risk of losing the lost of everything I love Someday I fold my hands and knees And ask for a sign from up above The star that shines so brightly Frank, are you listening? Or is that shiny sparkle an illusion of a glisten? I've allowed every part of me to drip into a pole The reflection is not me I didn't use to be this way Can you all not see? Staring at the ceiling is the confinement I speak of How can anyone feel this way if there really is a God The mirror shows me smiling Who's the smartass looking back? I see the person I once was just before the mirror cracks How can I describe this line That merges so very, very closely? So many emotions Help me please just give me a new focus Something to go on for, to liberate my mind Something to reassure me that this dark won't make me blind If I'm in a tunnel Then I'm still crawling in the dirt It's everyday life, the everyday things that make me want to burst You can't help, no one can, because I can't help myself I drowned myself a million times And gave myself the cards I have been dealt The deck of cards, the joker, the king, the queen and the ace Which one will I pick today and have to hide behind my face? I'm shaking My foot's going The urge is getting too much My mind is spinning My thoughts are lost And I'm roadkill for the truck I'm in love I'm in pain I'm still me but not quite the same I'm drowning I'm still flowing and I'm still heading for the dragon You made me see what I've become No resemblance of my former self Too proud, too tired, Too faithless to ask you for your help I'll lay upon this bed That ceiling is my best friend It's an aggressive one A torturous one Bitter until the end I don't live in hope Really I just survive Will any of you be here at the first sight of morning light? I'm in a self-created prison The confusion, the lack of vision The ball and chain, the bars I guess they were my decision What's with the Wade Radford name? So, you've got more than one name that you're known for. I was going under Wade since I was about 14 years old. It was a-- Wade was like a separate entity of mine. I suppose I do have an alter ego in a way, because I guess this week you see more of Jay than you see of Wade, even though this is... a documentary about the poetry that, you know, Wade allegedly writes. But does he really write it? Because Jay writes it and then we just release it under the brand name, I guess. So who the fuck is Wade? Beats me. I suppose just... I suppose, to be realistic, Wade is a more confident, more outgoing, more larger-than-life version of Jay Proctor. I think I find myself on, possibly, the biggest crossroads in my life. I find myself in no strings attached to anything anymore, Which, to me, said it was the best time to do something like this because... I don't do anything publicly really. I never have done. I've never done anything that's me. It's always been in a film of some variety. So I thought, you know, I think I've got a lot of things to say that I want to say and I think I've been trying to say that for the poetry books for the last few years, but still giving in no face really. So it was important to finally give that a face now. You know, I find myself looking for somewhere proper to live and call home. My life as it was a few months ago is completely changed and I'm kind of left with myself now. And this is an opportunity to close a chapter of the book that's long overdue. So the poetry mirrors sometimes the film works that he does. Again, I love the film because it's kind of what we do as a company, what I do. His work is truly indie work, the independent label, indie label that's tossed around frequently. In Hollywood, in film themes now, you know, a fifty-million-dollar Hollywood production is called independent. When, in fact, you should subtract a few zeroes from that sum and even then, it's not really truly an independent film. But Jay does make truly independent films with small budgets, seemingly, done on the fly, many times unscripted-- most times unscripted, without a script, improvisation. And, again, it's, you know, the theme, shot, edited, released. It's not spending six months to a year in post-production, as you can in Hollywood productions. Or even in the films that we do, our documentaries, it's months and months in post. And, again, you can take that as long as you want. I mean you can edit something down to where it takes forever and nothing's ever completed. Or like that they get it done and get it out, get the work out. And it lends itself to the themes that he you know, does do in his films. It lends itself to doing those type of subject matters. Obviously, the work can be controversial depending on what your definition of controversial is. Topical timely. And, again, I love that it covers a wide range of topics. Although certain people may be more familiar with certain types of his work, some people only know him from Twink , some people only know him from the Boys Behind Bars films. In many ways, I think Wade is as much an idea and ideology as he is, you know, a close friend of mine. If you look at movies like Twink or Caught In A Landslide , even the Boys movies, there's an ideology there that you don't find in a lot of other indie movies. And I think that's really-- You know, when I think of Wade I think of that as much as I think of him being my friend. So many different experiences that he's had, like, you know, when he's been happy, when he's been sad, when he's been just dangerously, dangerously low. You know, there's been some real scary times too. But, you know, at the end of the day we've battled through these things. And he's got all this down, you know, in his words and this poetry. I'll go to the edge if you do as well I'll jump jump right off It will be hell I'll get nude by the river if you stand there We'll dive right in, run fingers through wet hair I'll meet you by the bridge If you'll jump in Dive into oblivion It's the next step from sin We'll splash We'll drown It will be a hell of a time Who said risk wasn't sublime and divine Both naked and free Look at your grandeur You'll ask me what do I still hold your hand for Maybe we're not dangerous Maybe this disease is benign inside of each other We can become confined We'll wrap together We're not unadorned I think yesterday has now been mourned So plunge into me and give yourself away Down by the river is where we can stay At first we fall being deeply ardent Your presence to me makes you so absorbent Just swim with me in the river Fade into me Just touch me there We don't have to be anarchy I love your mayhem Just look at us float Lips upon mine and your chain around my throat We'll go disrobed and we'll flow with the stream Hands up defeated Will replay our extreme We'll go to the edge and off-off we'll jump Unclad, minds dissolved Give up this front From the bridge we'll dive In the river we'll fall and mate You get nude Me too Let's abdicate The poetry that Wade's done-- I know a fair bit here and there, to be honest. I have got a signed copy of one of his books he gave me because he did some spin-offs from the Boys films and the characters. But he spoke to me and I can see the Wade that I've known over the years and worked with, I can see little shimmers of himself in his artwork and his poetry and his writing, and even some of the characters and the literature he's took on to screen, it's all kind of linked with him. It's his own universe. So I can see the troubles and reflecting in his art from his real life experiences. You know I spent the last two and a half years writing mainly completely... detached from the film industry, which is what had kept me going up until then. And I compromised myself a lot in that time. And I think all of my fundamental values, who I am a bit of war with myself, kind of, for a long time and that's why I've been writing so much poetry and releasing so many poetry books in the last couple of years. Because it was my only way of... screaming from the rooftops when I couldn't scream and I wanted to. I'm just about to release my fourth poetry and prose anthology in a couple of weeks' time. It's called Disequilibrium . And that whole book is dedicated to two people and they're who I refer to as being stuck between two ghosts. And that's what I am. But The Ideation Of Six Feet Under , Seeing Red, and the forthcoming Disequilibrium , I need to make sense of all of that and lay it to bed and fuck it off and move forward into something new with the poetry. I feel like I've bled out as much as I could over the pages of all of them books and especially the new one. But what this new book symbolizes to me is it's the end of the road, you know. These emotions, the past cannot carry on. That's the end. So once this documentary is done, once that book's out, and once my new film Caught in a Landslide is officially released on the 11th of September this year in America, that's all I'm willing to feed these ghosts anymore, and then they need to disappear and I start again. It really matters, and it doesn't matter to what we do again. And that's again what was attracted to my work. It's raw, honest, unedited, unfiltered. What's there is there. If you like it, fine. If not, then fuck off, right? Basically that's it. Well, he knows how to... to get these feelings out on paper and he does it just brilliantly. It inspires me, like, to just no ends. I want to make every single poem of his a song of mine. Bedlam That's where you and I reside My chaos In only you I confide We are Bedlam, my boy Come let's be insane I've accepted Bedlam And I'm not ashamed I'm deluded That's why they placed me in Bedlam But Bedlam is me and you inside of the bedroom How I wish to go nuts and just fuck it all up Because we're Bedlam, my boy A storm in a cup I'll shriek at the ceiling while you cut a wall I'll shake and I'll shiver and run down the hall We're just making this crazy We're perfect at this We are Bedlam, my boy So give me a kiss Bedlam is a place Bedlam is a phrase It's still into each other's tired eyes that we gaze We're so taken over by our love That we can't move on We are Bedlam, my boy And we are so wrong I'm in love I'm in love But it's never been normal You and me both have always failed at formal Your little confused eyes just start to glare We are Bedlam, my boy And who the hell cares You're in love And you wish to cast down But when I disappear you want me about Now we're back here It's never seemed as insane We are Bedlam, my boy And we never change Bedlam is the bedroom Bedlam is our minds A story like ours has never been so well defined How long do we keep going before we lose the plot? We are Bedlam, my boy Bound together like a knot I seem to get this reaction with the poetry because... I think a lot of people think of poetry and they see someone-- I was about to say sat in a field quoting poetry. I am sat in the field but I'm not quoting poetry, so it's fine. [laughs] But I think the term "poetry" sounds very la-di-da. You know, they imagine someone sitting, reading a poem to their beloved, or sitting, reading a poem about nature. And I've already mentioned nature to you, about writing about the skyline and stuff like that. And that's not really what I do. I mentioned the places I look at and the places I see within my poetry, but... I can't write poetry for shit when I'm happy. So Jay's very prolific in his poetry and spoken word. Between the two, poetry anthology collections, individual writings, the books that are out, either digitally or hardcover, which I again appreciate, the craft between hardcover book and then, of course, digitally is just more convenient, more accessible to people. Same way as DVDs as opposed to streaming your films on your tablet or device or wherever you watch films. But I love the range. I took-- I narrowed it down to about sixteen poems that said something to me, I don't really like favorites, so I really don't have favorites. That changes really week to week, can be day to day, depending on how I'm feeling. But I did scope it down to maybe sixteen and I found... Particularly there's one that really just spoke to me, touched me, I understood and related to every word in it. If I'm bellowing out loads of poetry on a daily basis it means that comes from somewhere. That's me trying to work something out. So... I suppose what I'm trying to say is a lot of people, they listen to my poetry and they say to me sometimes, "Oh you sound really angry." I probably was. You know, "You sounded so down and so upset." I probably was. You know, but poetry has always been my oldest art form. It's what I always turn to when I need to get something out because it's legal, and murder is not. Returning to when I met Wade, after a gap of all sorts of films stuff we've done, and that it's quite bizarre really, because time goes very fast for me. It doesn't feel like that long ago, but it's really fun to be back doing something a bit creative, because over the years I've done all sorts of stuff, but working with Wade again has been-- it's been different in a good way, because, you know, it brings back the creativeness and it gets the juices flowing of all this crazy stuff we've done in the past which I did really enjoy and I felt like we were very proactive and I felt like we achieved a lot. So it's nice to be back feeling like I'm doing something worthwhile. You know, when I first started out in the whole punk thing, as messed up as my life was at that time and how I was scrambling through it, I found... that I could write and that's what saved me. You know, writing was, literally, my savior. And I think that is what it is for him at this point in time. It's what saving him from God knows, like, I don't-- I can't imagine what would become of him if he wasn't able to do this like I was able to do that. So I saw in him this kind of wild-centric kind of guy that was very young but had just so many powerful things to say. And so... And so, that's where the love story started for me. And when I say love story, I mean... love story like a mother loves her son. Sick My real king meets me by the heaf My soul was always his to keep I find myself back two years ago And I dive right in with you in tow I'm out of control Don't you know? And I seem to go wherever you go Stop between what I didn't want and do But all this time you always knew I still can't drown myself in a bath This ache I've carried so very far But I keep it because I'm so very sick Destruction is the lips we lick Just lay me down gently beside you Shroud me, cover me, hide me Just rise up above me Touch me again and love me Nothing new This is what me and you do And no one's got the courage to say this is through I'm on self-destruct And with a little luck One day soon we'll both be stuck My bomb's blowing all around I'll cover your ears so you don't hear the sound Because I'm out of control But not for you Remember this is just what I do You love me and you love this I'm that feeling Stolen with a kiss But that feeling is always reciprocated This love hell we've now created Just hold me again sometime We're better when we cross that line Because the romance becomes so sensual And you know that is essential Let's go on destruct You know we both don't give a fuck About the world and life, that is Because you are my only bliss Oh darling, aren't we sick You know we're so very, very sick All this time and all our rhymes laced across pages With true love defined You run from me I run from you And just look how the time flew But we find ourselves here by this ledge Let's jump off and destroy our heads So very sick So sick indeed So who's going to take the lead? Very sick are the pair of us both So let's stay in love and make the most But a work that really spoke to me in his poetry was "The Silence," from Seeing Red in 2017, and also in his new anthology. There were lines in that that really spoke to me, that really related. I think line by line maybe more than any other poem of his. Again, maybe more-- More immediate what you've heard or recalled, which thickened the brain more than something from the past, but I love that piece, "The Silence." Why do people write anything? It's because they've got something to say. And even if someone's writing a complete work of fiction, within that work of fiction is some of their own experiences and some of the things they'd imagined or-- Even with a crime writer. To me, that comes from the depth of the dark place within that person that can-- they can take that mind, their mind, and put it into something psychotic. But, you know, on the surface and their soul they're a very good person but they have the ability to take their mind to a dark place. To me, the only way to talk about pain is... to bellow it, write about it, and hope that someone else can get my message and that maybe I speak for them. So if I write about an aching heart, and I've been known to write it in brutal ways, I if I talk about that and someone reads it-- and I've had lovely comments in the past from people that just said a poem meant something to them-- Well, they can't imagine what that means to me, to hear that I could be a voice for them, to some degree. Memories I have of Wade throughout the years working would definitely be going to South End to film a film. That was quite a journey. That was a road trip for the day, that was quite mad. [laughs] It was-- Yeah, I don't know, I didn't trust his driving that much. I wore some Christopher chain to protect myself and... [laughs] There was a lot of Twitter going on on the backseat with Vicky as well. He was joining us for that journey. And it was a mad little journey that. Also when we were filming the first Sex, Lies & Depravity, driving through the village, a village in Buckinghamshire, it was a bit mental. We had like a storm going on. Wade told me if we was in Jurassic Park, because he thrashing through the puddles, going through the gates and stuff. We had to traipse out to get the sunrise in. We had to put the actor in his underwear early hours of the morning in the cot, which I was getting him to go further and further and Wade was worried that I was going to kill our actor. That he'd come down with hypothermia or something. But they stand out. And... being in a certain village hall, I've spent a lot of time with the man there on a lot of films and so. And I am actually currently looking at that village hall, so that's bringing back a lot of memories of a lot of films I have shot there. And a lot of extreme crazy stuff we put on screen. I mean, as I said, in 2014 I released my first poetry anthology. There is some stuff in there that's emotional to me, but it was very sort of politically driven and me... fascinating about, you know, post-apocalyptic universe. So, "Master Crotch & the Sex Hungry Human Minions" talks about the over-sexualization of media and politics and war, which are all things that I like to talk about. But that first poetry book stands out like a sore thumb. And then we have The Ideation of Six Feet Under, we might as well have just renamed that Daniel's Book. And then we have Seeing Red, and that was me trying to piece all these little pieces of my life back together back in 2017. But that didn't work because all it did was get worse. I pieced it all back together, or at least I thought I had, and then another situation erupts, and another situation, another cataclysmic situation that I should have seen a mile off and then I didn't, because I was so just not in my right mind at the time. And then by the time we get to my new book that's going to be released any day now, Disequilibrium , that was me going, "Look, I'm stood here naked basically. I'm stood here naked. I've got no more secrets. This is the truth. And this is horrible." And this was written at a time of something more horrible than I could have ever imagined that I would put myself in that place or in that position. And I did. I put myself in so many horrible positions. I look back in hindsight now, and hindsight really is a bastard, because I look back and I go, "The warning signs were all there. These people you've surrounded yourself with, these toxic people, and these toxic people you gave so much of your own soul to and so much of your own love and... and it was never going to be returned. Listen up Wade's calling You never ever listened when I was talking If it wasn't what you wanted to say Then you just chat on in constant replay Well now I've got this voice Listen up good because you've got no choice Choose to ignore Run, run, turn your back Swap reality for fun I'm talking Did I already say that? I'm going to impart some truth and some fact Silence type in for as long as I can remember We promised vows a couple of years back in November But you weren't then the aggressor you became I've struggled with you and now it's all done in vain Who's getting it next, the charm then the abuse? Why call it another name when that's the truth? It's psychological And it takes a hold of your brain You're so broken down you just wither with strain Angry eyes, nasty glances, no second chances So sweet back then how can I bypass your advances Your little group that you cooped That defend you each time You feed them lines too to cover your crime She sits in the corner and she actually goads you on The pair of you are both sick It's so fucking wrong I'd sit there And I'd listen to you both speak certain words Don't you get it She stares at you It's beyond perverse Everyone sees it but you cannot She's rotted you and made you corrupt But enough about her She isn't even worth the air It's more about you and the fact that I care I care what you do The next time love comes to knock I don't want anyone else to fall and then be forgot Reality check, boy I've cast you from connection I fear you'll destroy someone else's affection Are you going to come for me with that malice in your face Go on, come and find me I'm gone without a trace You constantly spat words about me not conversing That's because for so long it'd been just hurting You maim, you silence, you bully people down But I've reconnected with me since you've not been around I see you for you Spiteful, selfish and corrupt If it's not going your way, then it all gets too much Slam the doors, flip the table Lose your shit and go unstable The constant acts you've been committing are being labeled Not the first In a long line to suffer some kind of your crime But I'm finally the one who said no Not this time Look at your record It's getting kind of out of control For your loss of temper, you dug out this hole [sighs] Do you realize that you leave little frets When you look back Do you have any regrets Like about the things you told me About what has been done And I'm so ashamed that back then I didn't run About the dick wet evenings when you had lovers The fact that you created war Between two people you called mothers You've enjoyed other's hostility As long as they're fighting about you Why the fuck do you do the manipulative things that you do? I wish I'd never met you Because since we parted people reached out And I really had confirmed what I thought you were about You're dynamite on a short fuse Just waiting to explode You're a liar, a destroyer just spreading your load I'm so angry at you that I needed to say this I can't just walk on in ignorant bliss Because it happened And I have to be relieved Of these emotions that I have that upon me feed So here you have it You passive aggressor I hope one day you truly want to be better But I fear you won't I fear you will just grow in animosity But it won't be at me that you unleash atrocity The fuse, what if it gets even shorter? With you it could be anyone's son or daughter I can live with myself if your temper boiled over But I can't be the one to wrap you in clover Why wasn't you the kind man that I met? That special boy who made me forget Why did I have to learn so many hard truths Before I came along, you'd still committed abuse Be warned, don't come near I won't stand for it I don't want to be near you or any of your shit I know already that you're out spreading your seed Be brave, guys, don't be deceived I was naive to believe such romance It's a shame people don't come with history That you know in advance My head went a little crazy and you drove me insane But I'm now back even if I'll never be the same Thanks for all this I think you helped me find my name I just needed to have a moment to cry and complain So this is Wade calling I'm just having my say, not as damaged as you thought Not rotten in decay You have been my lesson That I forgot myself In a weird way you've been my reconnection of stealth So I bid you goodbye even though I fear what you'll do But then, when on the rampage, there's no stopping you You are not my responsibility any longer And I am moving on You will never come near me Goodbye, so long It's kind of funny one. It's a really important place to me. It's the blue bridge is just what I've always called it which I know must be shocking because it's, obviously, pink. [laughs] But no, it's a really important place to me in my life really. And, you know, as I said today, I've been sort of going back over... the place that I call home, really. And, yeah, again this was a place that, you know, during the summer, you know, me and my friends would spend days down here. It's in the middle of nowhere, away from everything, so we could, you know, do whatever we liked really. But kind of when I got to about 15, 16 years old, this was my place, you know, where-- I talk about in my book A Vision of Life , actually. I used to sort of be awake at one o'clock in the morning and I'd stuff pillows under my duvet to make it look like someone was in there sleeping, not that anyone ever checked, I'm sure. And then I'd creep downstairs in my parents' house, and I'd creep through the back door and I'd lock it up and I'd climb over the garden gate and I'd just go on this night walk for all these fields on my own into the middle of nowhere that brought me here. And it didn't have this mesh shit, you know, here when, you know, when I was a teenager. I'd literally, sit and I dangled my legs over the side. And I suppose it was my teenage angsty area really where I could sit and be with my thoughts, you know, have a few cheeky cigarettes. And it's like I'd come down here and kind of like throw my woes to the tide really, you know, and get rid of whatever I had pent up from during the day. So it's a really, really incredibly important place when I was growing up because I'd do that so often . You know, at least a couple of times a week, I'd come out here and I'd sit for a couple of hours in the dead of night and you'd get the sort of... the moon bouncing off the water. And... I suppose I've always been from a very young age someone that lived in my own head, really. And this place allowed me to do that. He gave me the setting and the scenery to be able to ponder my thoughts, really, and think about things, so. [Wade] After the escape from home had been completed, he'd always turn his head towards his parents' bedroom to make sure no lights had gone on. With one clarifying look, his hood would then go up and the young boy would disappear into the night. He'd tread the same tracks time and time again that in 10 years' time he'd repeat with a companion. The lonely confused boy would sit upon the bridge, legs dangled over the edge, and watch the last duck swim off into the moonlight. He'd make decisions here, he'd make plans. He'd reflect on all that had happened and dream of all that was going to happen. He was so lost. If I could sit before my childhood self, I'd be honest with him. Honest about one thing; life. It would never be simple. It would disappoint you time after time, But you'll keep going, because there really is no other alternative. I'd tell young Wade that he will succeed, and I would tell him that he would also fail. I'd tell him that one day ten years from now, he would own who he really is. That Jay was not dead, he was just resting. I'd tell him how liberating and freeing his past life regression would one day be. I'll admit that I would also lie to protect him. I would tell a fib for the greater good of his existence. If I tell him that rediscovering Jay will come at a high price, one of complete personal destruction, then little Wade will defiantly cling on to his persona forever. But he must break those chains. So, if it was possible to meet my little self, then I'd lie. I think the other thing about when I come down here as well it's-- You know, it's-- it's as I'm stood here thinking right now, it's the ambience. It's everything, you know, you got... Yet again more sheep bleating in the field and you know you just got this wildlife all around you, not to mention just the ripples of the water. And usually when the moon comes out, you get it from this direction. And it's completely pitch black. It like bounces off the water. And it kind of like reflects all the way down. Um, this is just nature, there's no humans about fucking it up. There's this real feeling of freedom in somewhere like this. You know, there's no constraints anymore. There's not the normal pressures of everyday life. There's not other people's bullshit being thrown upon you. You can be here on your own and it's the perfect setting for so many things. This place can never be the same as it was when I was fifteen. Here, places change depending on what happens there. And no matter how much you don't-- you try to deny that you're not thinking about something, you are. If I ever come here, my second thought would be being fifteen years old, sat on this bridge, smoking a fag. My first thought would be... me and Dan, here, together. That perfect moment captured in time. That one that I've written about so many times, you know. And that will always be the vision that I have when I'm here. As with a lot of places we all walk in our lives. We walk by or something that reminds us of it, and we go: "Yeah, I remember that day. That moment in time when I was with that person." Um... And if you're not actually here, then you... see it on the ceiling at night. The ceiling that I talk about so much in-- pretty much all of my poetry. That's where you see things like this, late at night. Just as I was here, I was-- um, thinking about a piece from Seeing Red that I had written. It's a really long piece so, I just-- there was, there was a particular piece in it that was appropriate for where we are now and I don't know me. You don't know me. So, when you don't, don't feel you own me. A fifteen-year-old boy stands upon the bridge, He's opening his mind; he's lifting the lid. He's crept out late in the dead of the night To watch the last duck swim off in the moonlight. He can see his breath as he sits in silence, The only calm he knows now that his mind is violent. He could sit here till morning just at one with himself. Just quietly thinking, just regaining his stealth. And ten years on, the bridge had mesh applied, For telling the confines that he wanted to deny. A prophecy maybe of what was to come. A reminder to the boy that he's no longer young. Let's go back to the sunny afternoon Where I'd sleep on you until we saw the moon No better place to cry than with you by my side Just hold me again for tonight I don't care that you lied Let's go back to nervous glances Everything to lose, plenty of chances Take me back to the Dartford Bridge I'll return through the amber tunnel Smiling like a kid Take me back to the best faux summer ever Jumping right in, not being so clever Just give me a dose of the sunshine I promise we'll have fun even if we're not fine Let's go back to late night, sofa, deep talks Let's go back to those never-ending walks Please, I'll let you once more be the spinner of yarns As long as when I cry, you return me to calm I promised myself to throw us in the junkyard, But I find our good times too special to discard I'll keep them a deep secret If you will too I'll only bring them out late at night Even though we are through So, how have you found today's filming then? [sighs] Exhausting, um, is one way of putting it. Um... I think actually when you're there in the moment filming, everything's kind of fine. Um... I found it more sort of uh, I don't know, I found myself more inside my head since leaving on this long trip back home. Well, we're in-- well, we're sort of on the arse end of... Poole and Bournemouth area. We came here on a bit of a whim, to be honest. Um, we've just been down there, Corfe Castle. I'm a bit lost for words at the moment because I, I-- We didn't actually know where this layby was with this view, but it is very ingrained in my memories for many different reasons. And I don't know, I pulled in the car from the side of the road and then, you know that's Bournemouth and Poole that you can see in the distance, and... Yeah, I don't know, it's pretty intense feelings. I don't know if it's important, I've only ever been here once. Just when we were talking about making the documentary, I needed to find this place and, luckily, we found it a lot easier than I thought we would. But I remember... It was about a year ago this month, finding this spot with my then partner. Most of the pictures in our living room were pictures taken, um, here. We had a convertible car at the time, and we had the roof down and there was-- the mushy couple's pictures. But I think, more importantly, with this area to me is the-- it was almost like the curtain call on the honeymoon period, on the whirlwind romance. As I say, it was all the pictures that we had in our home on the living room wall they were taken here. You know, really gooey ones with the roof down and having a kiss with the whole of this in the background, over, you know, of us. And it is a beautiful view. It's the kind of view I write about. It's the kind of thing I write about. It's perfect. Um, with sort of nowhere really to call home at the moment or you know, um... But it was also-- it was a setting of setting myself free. It was a decision I made after just a chain of events over maybe eight, nine months that were just inappropriate. And a chain of events really that continue to change my life in that-- I'd allowed myself to become part of something that was unhealthy and toxic in every sense. And the worst part of it was it was something that started off so promising. That's why I threw myself into it. And I'm a passionate person. When an opportunity comes along in life that I think will better my life, will better someone else's life, will, you know, lead me down a road of better existence, then I go for it. And I throw myself completely into that experience. And that's what I did. And it wasn't long after I-- It wasn't long after... the events in Bexley that... you know, I met my next partner. Um, charming, you know and really nice. Swept me off my feet and in my... Valium, alcohol-ridden state at the time, he seemed like a savior. But then as life goes by, I thought to myself: "I never needed anyone to save me once upon a time. I never needed to rely on anyone." This is a state that I found myself in later on down the road. And it was an embarrassing state. And it was one that was just not me. I was trying to be everything I wasn't. And I was just so focused on trying to settle down and trying to have some form of normal existence, which I hadn't had in the years before that with the filmmaking and life as it was, that I think I just threw myself into it, hoping that everything would just work out fine. It didn't. You never really think you'll see these places. It goes back to what I said to you before, that these places become ingrained in your mind and, you know, if you were ever to pass them it'd hit you like a tidal wave. But then you don't really expect to come and sit here either, especially when there's so much history there. Because one thought becomes another thought and another thought and another thought. So, it's not as simple as just being: "Oh, I was here once. And we sat here. And we watched the world go by." It's not as simple as that. The thoughts just keep coming because then that thought reminds me of something else that happened that weekend and something else. And it just uh, just manifests through it. In spite of... it being painful because it was uh... it was, uh, it was a time of happiness that turned so sour within seven days, you know, everything went wrong. This was the point, this was the point where a great weekend happened, and then that chapter ended and then came a whole load of hell that went on for far too long and I blame myself for that. Because we choose what we tolerate in life. And I cannot blame anyone else for what I was willing to tolerate. I have only got myself to blame for that, because we all have to take, you know, responsibility for the choices we make. Because we can choose to say, "No." We can choose to say, "I'm not doing this." We can choose to say, "I'm out of here." I did in the end but that took an awful lot of time. Um I remember a time when you lifted my grief But now grief is your name and that I keep You loved me for a time when I served a purpose Now, you just demand as you stand there nerveless And you're under my skin like swollen lymph nodes A rash like rubella as you come and go You're my stomach as it knots and turns Completely chewed up, every time you return Do you dream of the very beginning? The hopes and joys before your patience was thinning Can you picture our creation before it all got ruined? Can you name that time When this trouble started brewing? And you're in my mind like a growing lump Cascading inside my head as it starts to thump You turn from pain relief to a migraine And now I'm not sure I even know my own name You stared at me and "Gorgeous!" you said Flattering terms to get into my head You wiggled in just at the right time When I was vulnerable you made my life fine Like itched eczema when it starts to scab Your itch is crazy and it's making me mad. Like stubborn cuts when they won't heal up I feel like I just can't catch any luck I can't remember when you started to change Your voice just started to sound so strange Aggression just seemed to always be there And the heat from our sheets became so rare It's like scabies have invaded under my skin Spreading, and I can no longer win You're no longer the cream that would calm the aggravation And can never again give into your persuasion You're the noose that is going to be terminal The disease that flows internal [sighs] And I can see us at the bottom of that hill Realizing how we felt, and I wish we did still I can't take this from you anymore Worried that you'd behave as you did once before And the audacity of you to trick me like that Then still expect that I'll always come back It's toxic and it's taken over my brain You're my insomnia and my sleepless strain I'm exhausted and your embrace won't work. You promised me that this wouldn't ever hurt. So, what's this stuck in between ghost business that you've mentioned a few times on this journey? -Work from Disequilibrium ? -Yeah. Well, you know, as I've sort of mentioned you know, along the way or alluded to stuff, um... That's how I felt I have been for the last two and a half, three years is stuck between two ghosts, two people. And that that's the only way I can find to describe it. And you know, in-- in my poetry collection, Seeing Red , um, you know, I touch on that. This paranormal aspect of it, but, obviously, I'm not referring to the paranormal, I'm referring to-- Well at that point, Dan, who was sort of the main character, if you like, from The Ideation of Six Feet Under . So I referred to him heavily as the ghost and what I meant by that is it's like the ghost sweeps in, in the middle of the night when you're laying there looking at your ceiling. And that that's the only kind of analogy that I can think of. And then, in time that's gone by I found myself lumped with two ghosts. I think originally poetry was for me to be able to upset people, really. I think back in the early days I used it as a platform for my political musings and my... you know, rants about consumerism and the over sexualization in media. It was tongue in cheek stuff that belonged in Master Crotch and the Sex-Hungry Human Minions. I mean, even the front cover of a crotch in underwear with that title was me just practically going-- and kind of just trying to get a reaction, you know. I was even younger then and I wanted a reaction, though I wanted people to think about what I was writing as well, to try and see things through my eyes. And then, you know, I've always written poetry, but as it did when I was a teenager at the blue bridge, poetry then came back in my life at the end of summer 2016 and saved me once again. And it's continually saved me throughout segments in my life. Um, The Ideation was literally the lowest depths of misery I had at the time. And it was-- I might as well have just slit open a vein and, uh, shout it out to the world. And I argued with myself so much about: "Do I do that? Do I let people read such personal scribbles of mine?" And, yeah, I have to. I-- I'm not just Wade Boys Beyond Bars or Wade Twink , you know. I'm not just them films. I enjoy doing that stuff but... there is a much deeper level to me, um that I wanted to kind of share with people. And when I released Seeing Red it was the same thing. It was... recovery, it was-- It wasn't just recovery, actually. It was recovering from certain things. Um... But in Seeing Red there's certain elements of it, the prod that there's something not quite right. And I think if people read behind-- but, you know, between the lines, they go, "There's something still not quite right here." And then we arrive where I'm at now with Disequilibrium . And... I needed that book so bad. It helped me recover really quickly. It helped me put down on pages about two people, two toxic individuals in my life that had had far too much of my attention for far too long. And to be able to put it down on pages, to write about them, and who they are, and who they are to me, and what's happened, and what's been said, and what's been done. That is the quickest recovery, and the quickest bounce back from anything that I've had in my life. So, I really did use Disequilibrium to make sense of everything. And it did help me bounce back here. It helped me also go, "You, fuck off! You fuck off!" and I moved forward with getting my next film out, with this project, with getting another book out, starting to write another book. That whole project this forthcoming poetry book has allowed me to... be able to just take my soul out for an airing, is how I describe it in one of the poems. And there are so many poems in that book that have become so important to me. And so many poems that I feel blow anything I've ever done before completely out of the water. My driving force has always been people saying, "You can't." You know, um... Whenever people said I couldn't do something, I made sure I did it. Years ago, people said I was never going to make a film. And then I made a film and people said, "Well, no one's going to distribute it, are they? Yes, they did. "Okay, you got lucky. You're never going to do anymore." Yes, we did. You know, because I think a lot of human beings are fueled by other people's negativity and telling them that they can't be what they want to be. And I try to encourage people all the time to defy the odds and be-- be who they are. If you've got a dream, then dream it and then stop dreaming it and go and do it. There's a lot of my dreams that haven't worked out. But I tried, and then others have worked out. So, I would always encourage people to follow your heart and go out there. And if you need other people with lack of faith in you to be your driving force, then make it your driving force. Everything that I've done, people said I wouldn't do. Um, I think it is important to be able to stick the middle finger up in the end. And you never have to say it to them. You never have to go up to them and go: "I did this, you know, ha-ha-ha." No, you just have to know that you did it. Stay away from me I just want you to get away from me Get away from me Why can't you see I want your temper to evade me I've carefully mastered how to elude you And I need to find a way to consistently exclude you Because you continually continue to bemuse me Your ability to use then discard leaves me dumbfounded Your capability to manipulate leaves me astounded Stay away from me, just stay away Stay away, I don't want to play With you there's never any simplicity I know others are now ravaged by your toxicity You've spread toxic far too many times I'm just the latest in a row of maddened minds I need you to stay away Just keep away from me Take your poison, let me heal and be free Do you hear me? Stay away Just keep away Let me speak freely, clear my airway You're like a chemical agent dropped on my soul The black dog placed on my back, making me low You've infiltrated my mind with so many words unkind The test of time with you has made my face lined Who cares if we fell in love and we promised the universe? I didn't choose to become the next in line, cursed You lied to me and everyone who loves you So, stay away from me. No matter what you do I want your face to be replaced Rid of this feeling of sheer disgrace And I want to find another place Where you can't leave me in this state Stay away from me Just stay away Fuck off and find someone else to go and betray Hear me now, just stay away You've left us all in disarray The wakeup call was... a personal attack on... everything that defined me as a person. To witness another aggressive act, followed by... a pulling apart desecration of my laptop that held all my editing and poetry, to find my lewd poetry retrospective, that had just come out that week, I got a box load of them that we were doing a sign special for my website, to find the pages ripped out of those books, to find DVD's that had been chucked around the room of films that I had been in-- That was the final straw, because there's no love there. There's no affection there at all. That was an absolute-- Yeah, it was an absolute attack on... everything that defines me as a person and who I am. And that's when I knew that it had reached worrying levels, that I no longer wanted to be a part of any more. And that was the time-- that was the time to go. Um, and I should have done it sooner. You know, there's a whole line of... just... inappropriate stuff for so long and that I would think so little of myself to... allow myself to be treated like that. That's the first time in my life over the last couple of years that I clearly thought so little of myself and I'd forgotten myself so much to allow people to behave like that. But I won't allow that sort of behavior anymore. Um, because I never used to. So, why did I? That's something in the books that I had to take a good look at myself and go, you know: "Wade, what the fuck's wrong with you? Jay, Wade, whatever. One of you just wake the fuck up, you know, and have a bit of respect for yourself again. You know, find yourself again." [whispering] Come on, you're going to say "Hello" to the camera? Come on. This is Athena. Athina is my oldest girl. She's a very good friend of mine, aren't you? Or are you going to do something horrible? Hmm? She's uh, about middle age now. And she's grumpy and I like her. I like that cause she's sassy. But these-- these are my babies. These two go everywhere with me. Hey, you want to go up the arm? You want to go on the crawly walkabouts? She-- she's lovely. And then, you know, when she's getting feisty because she has to start trying to jump everywhere. You seem all right. In a minute, you'll feel nice and warm. Means you're being kept nice and warm, my lovely girl. Hmm? Yes. Go on then. Stop being lazy. I love you. You are being very lazy today. Come on, show your moves. Hey, here you go. You're not going to slip off on me again? Are you going to go down my back? And I'm going to have to wrestle you around the room? Hmm? You want your moment? I don't know, it's a funny thing cause, I um, actually used to be terrified of reptiles. And, um... an old boss that I used to work with... um, she needed this little one homed. And I remember the day I picked her up she was in the pot. I was absolutely terrified of her for about a week. Um, cause I really hated reptiles, that sort of thing. And then when I got to know her and she came out to see me, I couldn't help but love her. Hmm? Come on. Don't go down my back. And as I say, when I used to live in my old house, I just used to have loads of them, cause I absolutely loved them. I used to think they're the most beautiful creatures. This is Elektra. She's been in a bit of a bad mood since her most recent move. So, she used to be the tamest of all of them that I had. She would literally sit on my shoulder for ages while I walked about but... I've been having a bit of trouble settling her back in. She might go for the kill here. She sees this little cricket. [Jason] How do you feel about feeding them live animals when you yourself are a vegetarian? [Wade] This is the natural food chain. These animals, these reptiles, they're not as cognitive or you know they don't-- they're on instinct. They eat to survive. We have cognitive form and we have learned through the ages to know the difference between what's right and wrong. And I've never been one to tell people what to do. People do what they want to do, but I-- I know the difference between right and wrong and for me it's wrong to-- for me to buy a packet of meat that's been slaughtered and for me to eat it, the whole idea just makes me sick. These guys are not vegetarians. They, literally, live on these bugs and that is the food chain to them. Maybe I am a walking contradiction, as I'm sure some people are saying, but that's the way I see it. And um, I don't tell anyone to be a vegetarian, people can sit and eat meat in front of me. Don't particularly like it, but it's also not my business what they do with their life, you know. But um... Yeah, I'm pretty at peace with what I do. I'm pretty at peace with having these guys and what they need to eat, and what they need to survive. Because it's their natural hunting instincts. It's what they do. These guys rest in dark places and they eat bugs. We used to have a lot of animals. We even used to lik run a mouse hospice is what we called it, the Mouse Hospice. Little-- little mice that were uncared for and unloved and were getting old, they'd come to us to like have the last of their days in paradise. And they were really cute as well. And where did you run that from? You house? Yeah. We just had-- literally, you'd walk into the living room, there was pets everywhere. Guinea pigs, lizards Did the people bring their mice to you? No, there used to be this pet shop nearby us and they used to have like the back room for the unwanted. So, you know, um, the ones that were not sellable or they would be dropped on the doorstep or the road. So, we had a couple of mice as well. Um, lemurs, a house rabbit, a bit of everything really, whatever came along. You know I like animals, they are my therapy, so. Ache go, reclaim your home But you can't be an ache when you end up alone Headache moves From the wooden floor to the phone A cream fabric sofa in a place now unknown Ache feels the vibrate on his thigh from his phone No notification, no caller ID shown Up one flight of wood stairs, landing, then another Ache, how it aches, hide under the cover A multi-media library, ache look at the stacks But you can't fill a hole with bric-a-brac Ache, how it aches, this sofa is far too small Ache, baby in a womb, curled up in a ball Ache at the plaster, ache sees water damaged drip But you can't lay awake and think of that shit Ache, you are ache You ache and it pains Every time you break free, you find another chain Limb from limb it aches, you can feel tight muscle spots It's like under your skin the spots start to pop You turn the extractor fan on To clear the steam from the mirror But the light is fading ache, it's getting dimmer [sighs] You will ache around the field Under numerous types of skies Surrounded by specters the copious mountains of lies. Ache it's getting darker, ache it's not worth this It's just a fun house of mirrors and a faint whiff of piss The deers once ran in a woodland that's now a grave Ache this is reality, the deer were enslaved Fold out chairs and herbs, so much leaf, Ache, ache, ouch That's the process out of grief Ache go reclaim your home You don't need to wake When you put your head in the zone A headache begins move From the wooden floor to the bed The slanted ceiling above will only kill your head I am an atheist. I don't actually believe in the paranormal. I just love the subject and I love the idea of having a floating spirit coming to you at night and that is why I write about it so much. I love the idea of it. But I'm a non-believer in all that stuff, you know. Once we go from this life, we're not transcending anywhere. I come down to science on that front. We're on this journey and once we're dead, we're fucked. But, in saying that, I do believe that life delivers us just what we're destined to find at that certain time. It delivers us people at that certain times. It delivers us experiences at certain times. Now, I'm not saying that any divine power is in control of that. It's just the way it is. It's just the way our lives pan out. I believe that... there are certain things we're meant to do, and even go through. Um... And I certainly feel everyone I've come into contact within the last few years was sent to me for a purpose. And then, once they were gone, other people were delivered to me to-- I don't know, help with the healing process, to help share creativity, to help sit up until two, three in the morning and sit out in the street and watch the stars and just talk about life, because I'm that sort of deep person. I'm one of them people you just roll your eyes at and go: "Oh, for God's sake, will you just shut the fuck up." I'm absolutely exhausted, to be fair. And I kind of had a mad one last night. I was up till about 3:00 a.m. and then, you know, I start thinking about everything. And then, this morning, was one of them mad mornings that, you know, people have, where you wake up, and you go, "I'll have a downer." [laughs] That's kind of how it felt this morning. [cell phone rings] -You turn off. -Yeah. [cell phone rings] Hello. Hello. [disconnect tone] -Did he just hang up on you? -I think so. What the fuck was that about? [Jason] So, what actually happened? Cause we was driving home and I was filming and then the phone rang and it all went to shit. It was like: "What the fuck is going on?" [Wade] Um, just one of the ghosts. And the most recent ghost. I sound like I've got like a whole load of skeletons in my closet with all these, but, yeah, it was a difficult night. It's-- it's still only been a few months. So, everything's still fresh and it's um, you know, it's a difficult night. Now, I'm feeling pretty worn out today. I'm feeling pretty somber. And I'm thinking like-- I-- yesterday, as you know it was pretty heavy anyway, and I didn't feel like... going to Kent today was at all necessary. You know, how much more-- how much more shit am I going to throw on my shoulders at the moment. And this, as we've discussed, is meant to be a journey of sweeping everything under the rug for good. Between the new book and this documentary, it's meant to be... Dusting, dusting it all down and getting rid of it. And... So, in that respect, we're moving toward the end of the week now and tomorrow we're at a poetry recital for the audio recording of Disequilibrium . And I feel like I've seen a few places this week that were important to this whole tale. Um, felt like I spoke about it enough and, as I say, I just didn't-- I didn't feel that going back to Kent would actually achieve anything and I'm not in the mood, to be honest. A bed doesn't have to be empty to be lonely Turn back again, I plead if only A body doesn't have to be deprived of affection If that hand that wanders has no direction A bed that's full can still be tainted Immersed in the nightmare, after I fainted The waking up can still be the nightmare If the day that lies ahead is lacking the care A bed does not have to be empty for you to sleep alone A built house is not always a home A body can be present but the hands want to not touch This is the moment when it's all got too much After all the words have been spoken Caught in the web but still hoping The three-month stint of butterflies Went by so fast and turned to lies Blue is the color, the shade of me now The bed's not empty but the sheets are foul A bed doesn't have to be empty for you to lay as one The beginning of the end has now begun Well you said, "Am I a recluse?" [Jason] Yeah, truthfully you are, you are. I'm quite reclusive. I have a very small circle. You know, I mean... my best friend, known to me as Donner and known to the rest of the world as Honey Bane. She's about the only person I see on a semi-regular basis. Um... And I've got a small, small circle of people. I don't, I don't like going out much to social events. I don't really like humans very much. I just I like doing my own thing. I like being creative and I like having the people I love around me. I'm no socialite. I don't want to make a load of friends. I've turned down every event that I've ever been invited to publicly. And even the ones I said I'd do, didn't end up happening. I don't know, I get to the-- I don't know, is it social anxiety? Maybe, but I just-- I feel uncomfortable. I don't even like going out for big meals with people and there's like eight of you that sat around the table. I'm always the one to miss important special dos that people have. If you invite me to a wedding, I'm probably not going to be there. If you invite me to a christening, I'm definitely not going to be there. Yeah, I just-- In my head I go: "I'll do these things. I'll do these things." And then when it comes down to it, you know, I don't. And as you know, I can never be on time. I struggle with that greatly. You know, it's even like this morning. I just-- it was one of the mornings, I woke up and I needed time... to just be with myself and to wake up properly. And have a you know, a cup of blueberry tea because I'm quaint like that. Um... you know, sit and have a couple of cigarettes. And I just need that time with my headphones in in the morning, where I love music. So, I have to wake up every day and I'll have a cigarette, and a cup of tea in the garden, and I'll have my headphones in with my music. And, you know, that's-- that's-- that's how I need to start my day. Right. So, you know, this morning when I was getting ready to leave and sort out my shit of what I was going to entertain you with for the day. I was trying to figure out, you know, what the hell was going on. So, I was going through some old stuff and you know, I came across a poem from The Ideation of Six Feet Under. And it was called "Love Sick" and it goes a little bit like this: You met him by the hospital bed A fictional lie, one from within your head You said the words, you had to stick It wasn't him; it was you that was sick I hate those lies, hate how I'm blind But I'm sick enough to love your mind You'll eat my heart and chew my brain Loving you, how could I abstain I hate your lies, but I'm still listening After the war again, we're kissing I'll chase you just like you chase me I'll taste you just as you taste me I hate those lies, hate how I'm blind But I'm sick enough to love your mind What do you give me? Absolutely nil. But I'll keep going, love you still You love me, you know you do It's okay because I love you too I'll save you, when you feel mental Because to feel your pain is my essential Nothing makes me come like a love extreme We've destroyed each other and it's serene I'm your item or at least you think Mind games, cat-and-mouse that's our link You miss me and I miss you But what do we miss, there's nothing to do? We've killed each other, we went too far Love extremities, we raised the bar I hate those lies, I hate how we're blind, To a love so sick, it crossed a new line Why do I feel we'll both never be free? We'll destroy each other to the tenth degree How did-- how do you deal with your dark times? When you had, like, dark moments and depression. I think these days I do look a lot better than I have in the past, um... You know, I've-- in the past especially, if we sort of go back to-- I don't know, August 2016, um, Valium and red wine was a good coping mechanism. Um, and I was probably putting far too much of that away. Yeah, that's an escapism. I didn't want to feel that grief anymore and that pain. So, it was just best to get it off my head. If only you knew the dire straits I'm in If only you knew, where do I begin? Only you know, you know me better than that Only, you know, I'm lying I'm heading off the track It's no better, it's not light Only you don't know to what place I've traveled Where did I go? If only, you knew If only you knew it was lonely Would only you be the one who would hold me? Only you, wasn't it always Through despair and rage Only you know that upon your bed I laid. The indent is mine, but only you know Like only you and I know About the stream we watched flow Only me, only you We know a story that's never really been told Only together did we create the page, scribble, then fold I often wonder what you think But only you know your dreams Only you can reveal them and all of their things Only you know why you linger? Why you float? Only you are my landslide, my confusing little slope Only you know the reasons for all that you do All that I know is that it's only ever you Bruerne, Stoke Bruerne, um, which is just outside Northamptonshire. Um, it's a place I'd like to come over the years. Last time I was here actually was 2016 with my-- my dear ghost from Bexley. Um, I haven't really been up here since, because what's the point. Actually never one of them, I think about you know, when I'm writing poetry because it's, uh, it's pretty, atmospheric, you know, and it's-- I like the whole Canalside, you know, High Street if you want to call it that. I mean as you go out beyond this bridge that's where they got like pubs and cafes and the Canal Museum and all that shit. Every time I get the chance to actually sit and have some time to relax, then I'm going: "Oh, wait a minute. What do I need to do?" You know, I need to find something to do. So, I just can't seem to win with myself really. It's you know, damned if I do. Damned if I don't. Don't want things to do and then when I haven't got anything to do my head's exploding with boredom and monotony and I just can't-- yeah. Sometimes I just have to disappear. I have to go into my little cocoon and disappear and not deal with any of the bullshit. Because sometimes ignorance is bliss. Sometimes I just have to go-- "I can't even deal with this right now. I need to I need to-- I need to go and chill." Because, also, if we try and deal with things when we're in a bad place, we make bad decisions. And I don't want to make bad decisions, because I know I'm capable of making bad decisions, we all are. So, why would I put myself in a position where... I'd do that. You know, I need to go away, calm down, be on my own, be with-- be at one with myself, get a bit of zen going on, cuddle a gecko, something like that. Destruction is as destruction does But destructiveness means we cared enough Destructive ways and endless tears Even the realization of unwanted fears Destruction is destruction reigns In a vision of life, a never-ending game How I wish you'd hit me, so I can feel the rage Still read the book, still love you the next page Destruction is because destruction is real We only destruct when we really feel I am in agony I'm in pain I want it no other way For as long as I hurt then we'll both stay Destruction is your lips upon mine too And I'll love you on and on until you come through And you lied and you cried, and I know you love me The things you do are a reflection of you Destruction does as destruction is let And I'll dry your eyes after you have wept Break me, take me, love me and hate And we'll still embrace while we're in this state Destruction is mine Destruction is yours Two broken people, the costly cause And you don't want to cry, your heart wants to not beat But destruction is mine, and it's your love I keep Destruction belongs, destruction holds on Either way you want to look at it, Is the love hate so wrong? It's so messed up, but it feels so real If you took my heart and it's yours, I'll steal Destruction creates Destruction takes Destruction's ours, until we both break It was written in stone; it was on the wall And we can't escape the damage because it's too tall I want your pain I want your smile I'd still hurt, drive all the miles And it doesn't make sense It's pretty far out I'll never understand what it's about I'll give you my agony I'll give you my joy I'll let you peek inside at the vulnerable boy We'll break up We'll make up And I'll love you each time All that glitters is not golden but this feeling was divine Destruction is you Destruction is me It happened now, so, we'll never be free You can run and so can I But it will never remove all the tears we've cried And destruction is the way we embraced Destruction is the painful taste Destruction is the making up Destruction is the breaking up Destruction is the trying to move on Destruction is the all that went wrong Destruction is me and you Destruction, my love, through and through And I guess I'm sick because I'd do it all again The only question now is where and when? Mental health is our... new-age problem. You know, it's... everyone's suffering these days, so it seems. Life is hard. The pressures that society put on teenagers at school to do their exams, social media, film, has young boys and girls looking at it going, "I wish my body looked like that. I wish I could sing like that. I wish I could be on one of these TV talent shows." And they look at themselves in the mirror and they feel like shit. And society keeps going, keeps-- keeps portraying these boy bands and these girl bands that you've got to be this slim. And you've got to have this kind of hair. And wear these kind of fashionable clothes. So, there's a real-- there's a real image of what a young boy and girl is meant to be now. So straightaway, they're growing up with anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, then they're going to school and learning subjects they, quite frankly, don't need to be wasting their time on. So, that's causing them stress. So, then they're stressed out. Then we have them go through adolescence and we're living in toxic times. People are so toxic to each other now. You even go on Facebook and you look at them, the arguments people have on there and the way they air their dirty laundry. And you go: "No wonder everyone is frazzled and stressed out." And everything is a competition as well. We are literally living in the age of a mental health crisis. No one is happy with themselves anymore. They always think they need to be something better. Something different other than who they are. People feel they can't talk about things because... they'll be judged for it. So, you've got men that go "I can't tell people I'm depressed because they'll judge me, because I'm meant to be a big masculine man that asserts my masculinity on people," which is, quite frankly, bullshit. You know, why can't a man cry? Why can't a man admit that he's struggling? Why can't a man turn around and go: "I'm worried about my body, I have body dysmorphia. I don't like the way I look. I'm having panic attacks. I'm anxious. I am deeply depressed to the point that I'm verging on suicidal ideation." And you know, this is our problem. We just got-- we've actually got such a close narrow-minded society. And that's why I do the poetry. I don't care what people think of me. I don't care if they think I'm moaning and winging about the things that are hurting me. People have to learn to own their hurt. And it's not for you to turn around to me and go: "Oh, yeah. But Wade, this happened to me and that was way worse than what you're going through." This is what I always say to people, stop trying to have a competition and compare your hurts. If someone is hurting, allow them to hurt and allow them to talk about that. Allow them to own it. Be there for them. What is hurting them may not hurt you, but you don't get to tell them not to hurt. And it's the same thing about the way people treat each other. If you hurt me, you don't get to tell me that you didn't hurt me. If I say "Jason, you did something that hurt me," you don't get to take that away from me. I'm hurting. And we just have-- it's such a troubling society these days. It honestly is. It's like people become more and more closed down and they sit behind-- they sit behind their computer screens and rot away with no way to vent themselves. And I won't be that person. And I've always hoped to inspire other people to write their feelings down. It's the same time, you know, people in the past have said to me, "Oh, I can't write poetry and that." And I say, "Well, who says I can write poetry?" Who actually awarded me the title of a poet? No one, you know. So, I say all poetry is is you sitting down with your phone memos or a piece of paper or laptop and you letting your hurt-- your hurts and thoughts come out. And that's all it is. Anyone can do it. And I encourage people to do it because the more we bottle these things up, we bottle them up, and bottle them up, until they just go pop. And the result is devastating when you bottle it up for so long. So, this is what you call popular culture From where I'm sitting, it's what I call vulgar Magazine, marriage, dreams, and live cover From one manufactured boy band then on to the other Topless singers with the intent to sell to young youths Scandal on the Internet, but never the truth Who cares who's getting married or who'sputting it where? The hardest truth of all is actually some people care The man is on film in a big budget waste of tape We let the children dream of the superhero in the cape We cover the truth and only speak what is commercial Because the reality creates warriors And that is controversial Silence the youth with an app full of the gossip It's hard to imagine that the media's fucking lost it And what was once a real talent is lost to nip-and-tuck And the perception of good looks dictates who we fuck A girl bases her dreams on the wedding on television And because of fame, it affects all of her decisions She could have been so human; she could have changed lives Now, she's getting a breast enlargement And tripling the size The young man wants to kick a ball and play for the top team But playing pro football isn't actually his dream He wants the underwear modeling contract The girls, the cash And another useless magazine spread just ready for the trash And the mothers at home Want their kids to live out their dreams Because to watch them on The X Factor makes them scream Whatever happened to hard work and graft? Just another useless one-hit wonder and a pain in the arse Hollywood kills another who couldn't handle the strain Of having so much, so much fucking fame Too many bitches to handle, too many lawsuits, and pills And then it makes the front page and the story spills It's trending, it's offending, and people say what a pity? While we cover the drama, we made them feel shitty We dug out the grave and we wore down the star And we squeezed and squeezed and pushed too far Quick, he's dead Let's cash in A DVD in a steel book tin A greatest hits album, posters and merch Forget about the loved ones that will hurt An idol, an icon, we need a new one fast But we all know the critically-acclaimed Doesn't last It's over in a flash once it's made its cash And they'll even report the cremation as an icon turns to ash So this is what you call popular culture When the media swoops down like savage vultures They make all the dollar They cover your life and your death And then they milk some more cash from whatever's left I am really... freakily, knackered after that. That was intense. That was probably one of the most intense things I've ever done. Um, you know, I was-- it was really difficult at first. Um, but you know, I kind of got into it after a while. I think I've just never had the opportunity to actually... recite that much poetry when I'm not on my own, sat recording it in a room for SoundCloud. Yeah, you are. He was a bag of nerves. He really was. -Because I'm a shy really. -What, yeah? But no, you pulled it all together. He pulled it all together. He is great. I've literally never done anything like that. It either goes in a book or it goes... me sitting alone in my bedroom just doing a quick recording on my phone for SoundCloud. I've never done anything like that. That was out of this world. I mean I am absolutely shattered now. You know, you're going to have to keep on doing stuff like this now, because your fans are not going to want anything less from you now. You're going to be recording a lot of poetry, I think, in the future as well. I said at some point during the week that-- um, this was to close a chapter in my life and that was what I set out with the intention to do. And then I got to this point where it didn't-- you know, it didn't quite go that way. I got to the midweek point and I went: "This is just tearing open wounds." I've spent nights awake without days filming, and it's kind of really backfired in my face at the start. Um, I feel like-- I talk about in my new book about taking my soul out for an airing. And I feel like what I've done today, reciting the poetry on camera, not only have I proved to myself I can do it, I've also-- it was like speaking out loud with all the rage and all the true emotions that I needed. And as I've said before in one of my poems that I can't remember which one it was, and as I've said in my books before, "At the end of this journey, you know, I feel like the truth really does set you free." You no longer choke You no longer strangle my throat Your cold fingers are gone The road walked was long You no longer smother Who I am, you don't cover My malevolent shroud taken off I prayed for it to stop Your bare grip removed No longer am I abused I don't feel like I'm losing Decisions, I'm now choosing Your toxicity dispersed And I no longer hurt The tears are only for me Not for you, you see My head's not in the noose No longer any excuse to do that to myself It's now me I will help There's life after death There's air after, no breath The world is mine to explore beyond you both There's more Head out of the water Dodge the executioner's slaughter There's much more to me That you'll never see ♪ It's like I never existed ♪ ♪ Like I was never there ♪ ♪ It's like our eyes Never locked ♪ ♪ I never held the glare ♪ ♪ It's like I never mattered ♪ ♪ I didn't ever exist ♪ ♪ It's like we never met lips ♪ ♪ Like we never kissed ♪ As an artist, I'm saying that I enjoy creating. And if someone enjoys what I create, bonus. But even if people weren't buying, I'd still be doing it because it is the very essence of who I am. It defines me as a person. I like to create things. It keeps me busy. It keeps my mind occupied. And it stops me going fucking mental, to be honest, because that's what I'd be without creativity and without an avenue to vent it, I would be fucking mental.
