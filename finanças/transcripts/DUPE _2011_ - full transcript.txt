Brought to you by Fighting! Fansubs {\a6}[Episode 19] Our last goodbye. Hurry call the elevator, before I start feeling regretful. This... This... Is it the third tear drop? Hey, it's the third tear drop. That means... it's real? Shin Ji Hyun, you must have lived quite a useful life. This is a very rare situation. What's going on? Nobody cried for me. There's really no one. Didn't I tell you, people's hearts constantly change, there's no such thing as forever. Then... I can go back now? You're curious to know who it was, right? Don't say it. I don't want to know. You don't want to know? If I knew, I'm afraid I'll just love these 3 people. You're pretty wise. All right. Then, go on. Saying goodbye to you... Ji Hyun's mom. What happened? Why? Ji Hyun! Look! Look! Our Ji Hyun! Mother! Ji Hyun opened her eyes! Ji Hyun! You... Ji Hyun, Ji Hyun..! Hurry go call the doctor, go! Ji Hyun. Ji Hyun... It's Dad! Ji Hyun. Miss Song Yi Kyung! Please come in. Why aren't you coming down to eat? I'm going back. Miss Yi Kyung, where are you going? I've got no reason to continue living here. What do you mean? What do you mean by no reason? Hold on... This isn't the Song Yi Kyung I know. Uncle, is Ji Hyun all right? Kang, what am I going to do? I think we've got the dates wrong. What do you mean? The real Song Yi Kyung packed up and left. She said that she had no reason to stay. What does that mean? What does she mean by that? Then, Ji Hyun... She died? How... did this happen? Ji Hyun, do you still remember Mom? Of course. Dad. Yes. I am Dad. Seo Woo. Ji Hyun. No, it can't be... [Ji Hyun's mother] Hello, Auntie? Chairman Han, you're back. Our Ji Hyun woke up. She woke up?! Unni, I missed you. You're not sick, are you? Ji Hyun! She's having a check-up now. All right. Father and Mother, congratulations. Congratulations to you too, chap. Right, my father said he would invest in the Shin family. Re... Really? He said that he would send a lawyer to Korea tomorrow. After the paperwork is done, the transaction will be done immediately. How can I ever repay this kindness? He decided to invest after carefully analyzing Hae Mi Island's business condition. Ji Hyun's done with her check-up. Father, Professor Cho wants to speak with you. All right. Her blood pressure is normal. And her brainwaves, currently, are normal as well. Didn't I tell you, young man. I told you she can wake up, and you said she couldn't. From medical studies, it is impossible. It surpasses medical studies, you can only call this a miracle. No matter what, she is alive. There aren't any other exceptions? Her muscles and joints are a little stiff, she would have difficulty if involved in vigorous activites. I'll go check on Ji Hyun then. I've lived for 47 days without knowing the fun of eating. It's really delicious. Eat slowly, you'll have so many more chances to eat. Even my mother's nagging is such a relief. Mom, let me hug you once more. My darling. It's really great that you came back. The world's cutest mother. Hey, me too, I want to be hugged again. All right, Seo Woo. Thank you. I didn't do much, what's there to thank me for. I'm thanking you for being born as my friend. How cheesy, but it feels good. I should be the one thanking you. Thank you so much. Han Kang, long time no see. But why did you come? Did you come after hearing about me? Honey, when you were still in coma... but where's In Jung and Min Ho oppa? Since Kang is here, why aren't they here? Ah, Min Ho went to Europe because of some business in Hae Mi Island. We haven't got a chance to contact In Jung. President Han? Seo Woo, come out for a moment. What is it Mom? Say it here. She just woke up, if she knew about In Jung and Min Ho, she might not take it. She shouldn't know about her dad's company businesses, and the surgery. Before Ji Hyun recovers, we must keep this a secret. Then, Ji Hyun only has memories from before the accident? Of course. That's why I'm worried. That was the happiest moment of her life a week before the marriage. Yes. President Han, all your worries... I'll tell Ji Hyun everything once she recovers. I'm fine with that. Mother, Ji Hyun might think this is weird. That's right, let's go in. Director Jung, is our new office ready? I'll submit my resignation letter after the Hae Mi Island shares have been transferred. Visiting your fianc? in the hospital? Didn't you know that she woke up, Mr. Kang? What do you mean... Such a brave person like you can be surprised. What did he mean? Does it mean that Ji Hyun woke up? I'm sorry, I thought no one was in. That person left. She won't come back. If you don't believe me, check with Shin Ji Hyun in her ward. I know. If you knew, why did you still come? I won't stay for long in this room, take back the rents from the landlord. It's only for a few days, but return the keys to me. I rented this room to kick you out, so I have no need for it. The money has been paid anyway, so I used your name to sign the contract. Please hand over the keys. What are your plans? I'm not Shin Ji Hyun, don't be confused. I'm not trying to, make things difficult for you. Then please leave. Was Daddy and Mommy here all the time when I was in coma? Of course. I stayed here longer than your mother. Wow, I feel so fortunate. That's right. Shin Ji Hyun is really fortunate. But then, Han Kang, why aren't you leaving? Hey you, he's been sending you flowers when you were in coma, That's right, he really cares a lot for you, and he even took care of us. Is that so? Seems like you're really loyal. Thank you. Hey, didn't you say a person would die if he suddenly changes? Why are you acting so differently? Go back first. Oh, all right. Did you visit Ji Hyun? Ahjusshi, Ji Hyun doesn't remember me anymore. She forgot about my relationship with her. The memory of 49 days is all gone. Is that so? I heard that the 49 days was just a mythical tale. That must be why she's like that. What will happen to our Kang? He's back to unrequited loving. But I feel really upset. You wouldn't be human if you weren't sad. I think that it's funny I feel sad, and also, would that be important when she's come back to life? Excuse me! 48 days would be enough. Can't I work for just 48 days? I don't have much time left. I saw my friend at the hotel, and I also saw my fianc?. You don't seem to have much strength, so I hugged you to get you pumped up. A comforting hug. Leaving the piano could mean everything to your mother. When my mother was feeling down, she plays the piano to comfort herself. Please tell Ji Hyun that, after she wakes up, she must repeat what, she wanted to say. Don't leave without a word. Don't leave like my mother. How can she forget it all? Yi Soo... when are you coming back? Come back quickly. {\a6}{\3c&HFF00FF&}Saying I love you, {\a6}{\3c&HFF00FF&}are words my heart have always shouted. {\a6}{\3c&HFF00FF&}Saying I love you, {\a6}{\3c&HFF00FF&}are words I've repeated, behind you. {\a6}{\3c&HFF00FF&}Saying I love you, {\a6}{\3c&HFF00FF&}are words I couldn't say, afraid you'd run away. {\a6}{\3c&HFF00FF&}I love you, {\a6}{\3c&HFF00FF&}so much that I'm afraid. {\a6}{\3c&HFF00FF&}I love you. I didn't have my phone, so I couldn't call you before coming. I just want to tell you that Ji Hyun woke up. What? In the hospital, Ji Hyun regained consciousness. What a relief, that's great. It is a relief, but she... she'd forgotten everything that happened. She probably won't be able to remember you either. Is that so? So, I'll express my gratitude to you first. Thank you for helping Ji Hyun. I'm really grateful. It's nothing. So... Because of Ji Hyun, you even quit your job at the coffee shop. Yi Kyung, how about working at my shop? You don't have to care about me. It's also because you're a professional. I... am waiting for someone. Please hold on. Ji Hyun asked me to give this to you before she had left. She said that it was your mother's relic. This... is my mom's? How... She didn't explain. Ask her yourself then. Also... she said that she's grateful, and she's sorry for having to trouble you all the time. If it wasn't for Kang, she wouldn't have been able to go through this period. That was what she wanted me to tell you. What do you mean by that? The JC funds that were already prepared... Why are you asking me that? The Shin family's business supervisor is you. Return whatever you've borrowed. Stick to the plan. Come to the Shin's tomorrow. It shouldn't be that way. It's all because of you. It's because of your greediness in trying to get Mr Shin's will. If you hadn't threatened us, and made us delay the bankruptcy, things wouldn't be like this, you jerk. {\a6}[Secretary Shin] What are you planning to do now, how are you going to be responsible? I'll go clarify whatever that has happened. And then we'll talk. No response from the receiver. Please leave your message after the tone. Oppa. Let's eat together. Do you need anything? Ki Jun, haven't you heard anything from your owner? The investment problems and also the money problems. Ah, that. Our CEO went to the States to receive the investment. What? Then why didn't you tell me?! Why do I have to tell you? I'm not the type who sells his conscience to money. Then the information you've told me during this period, about Kang were all fake? No matter what company, even if it's HM, I can get in through exams. Hello, I'm Kang Min Ho. This is the Prosecutor's office. We contacted you because we've collected some information about you. information? Because we have to investigate some matters, please come down to the prosecutor's office by tomorrow at 10am. {\a6}{\3c&H000080&}The time that has passed since you left, has already been a day. {\a6}{\3c&H000080&}Already, {\a6}{\3c&H000080&}I am fearing that, {\a6}{\3c&H000080&}I only have a drawing called you. {\a6}{\3c&H000080&}I know it isn't possible for me, {\a6}{\3c&H000080&}but I can't do anything without you, One step like this I can't walk, {\a6}{\3c&H000080&}I can't even take another step. Suh Jin Young. Are you mocking me as well? You're telling me I can do nothing but drown myself in alcohol, right? I can only act comfortably around you... for now. I really don't wish to see you in this state. Staying by my side... has no incentive for you, is that it? Kang Min Ho is finished. This is all new to me. Since high school, you were always incredible. The Kang Min Ho I was and what I've become, I know it well. I know it all. But I... won't give up so easily. How did you come in? I asked Jin Young. Why are you here? Could you not appear in front of me? PLEASE STOP APPEARING IN FRONT OF ME! Before I leave Seoul, I came to say goodbye. I'm going to Jin Nan for a while, call me if you need anything. Oppa... I'm sorry. You're making me, unable to apologize to you. In Jung seems really sick. She doesn't seem to have energy to do anything. If she knew I woke up, she might run here immediately. She's not answering her calls. That's why you should go check on her at home. Shin Ji Hyun. Congratulations on coming back. I will come here everyday. Try to get used to it. Mother, Ji Hyun can eat cake right? Let's wait till In Jung's here before eating. Ji Hyun. Your friend, Jung Eun... Oh, no I meant your friend Song Yi Kyung. My friend from the club? Do you still remember the seal you gave her? I don't remember. What does that mean? Oh? It's nothing... Let's go for physical therapy. I'll take her. Why would you? Mother, we're leaving. Hold onto that, your left leg. Use more strength, your left leg. Good, hold on for a while. Be careful. {\a6}{\3c&H008080&}I felt that you came into my heart, {\a6}{\3c&H008080&}Always appearing in my heart. {\a6}{\3c&H008080&}Even your breath, {\a6}{\3c&H008080&}seems like it's talking to me. {\a6}{\3c&H008080&}Love came, {\a6}{\3c&H008080&}and stole my heart. {\a6}{\3c&H008080&}Even so, I'm happy, {\a6}{\3c&H008080&}I love you more, {\a6}{\3c&H008080&}because I would be happy loving you. What's with him? The air is nice isn't it? Where are we going? Han Kang. Why are you like this? Do you hate me acting like this? I don't hate you. It's just weird. What's weird? How does it feel to come back to life? Good? Yes. Very good. I am very good as well, because you came back to life. Shin Ji Hyun, what were you doing for the past 47 days? Were you sleeping? Did you dream? If I did dream, must I tell you? Did I appear at least once in that dream? Why would you appear in my dream? I want to go back in. I want to rest. All right. I'll do what you want. Ji Hyun... woke up? You must've been wishing she didn't. But after she woke up, she's been asking for you. Ji Hyun has been wanting to see you, so why don't you go with Mother to visit her. You're telling me to visit Ji Hyun? Ji Hyun doesn't know anything, about you and Kang Min Ho, and stuff about the company. You should've said that I went overseas. We're not asking you to apologize to her. Just treat her like you always did, just for now. Can't you do that? I can't go. I'm not going. Why? You've been doing well in deceiving Ji Hyun, just treat her like you did last time. Mother. Who are you calling Mother? Shin In Jung, go visit her if you still have a conscience. Go visit her, treat her like you did before the accident. Let's go. Mother. I was wrong. It was all my fault. So please don't let me visit Ji Hyun, all right? Please, I can't bring myself to face her. Han Kang, are you really going to, come here daily? Yes, everyday, I'll stay here for the whole day. I hope that you would concentrate on designing matters. You drew that right? I really like it. You have a talent like no other, why don't you show it? There's no one to show it to, and there's no one to share it with. If I were to concentrate on designing, would you look at it? Why do you keep acting like that? Ji Hyun, In Jung is here. Let us be alone for a while. The two of you? Han Kang, please buy my mom some coffee. Mother, let's go out. Ji Hyun. Hey, Shin In Jung. I slept for so long, and dreamt. On the engagement day, didn't my heels break? I saw that you gave me your heels. And then you selflessly, removed your shoes and ran bare-footed. At that moment, you removed your heels for me. What... what do you mean? Heels... are women's pride. And you gave up your pride, just for me at that moment. Forgetting the engagement ceremony, and putting my importance before that... Because... I was your friend. Ji Hyun... I'm tired. Leave. There's still a week left because of the penalty. Stupid old woman. Little one. Little one. Little one. Why? I didn't do anything wrong. Why did you call me? You punk. You think you can be rude to me just because your tenure in office is over? I'm like this because I'm really frustrated. My human feelings all come back when my tenure is up. Your memory has come back, but because you can't acknowledge her, you're anxious, right? Stop it. I'm tired to death. A dead person can die again? Even if you're going to die, you have to meet Song Yi Kyung before leaving. What? Isn't today the last day of your tenure in office? I received punishment... and I still have a week to go. I told you to be a Scheduler for another week, I didn't say that you are to visit Song Yi Kyung after that. That's right. Why didn't I think about this. Then... I can visit Yi Kyung tomorrow? [To Yi Kyung I sincerely congratulate you on your 21st birthday. To always be beautiful, my Yi Kyung. Love, Yi Soo.] [Invitation from Song Yi Soo] {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}I choked myself, I can't even say anything. {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}As I absent-mindedly look at the sky for a while, I began to cry. {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}"Just forget it... Please just forget it... I'm all by myself... {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}So just stop it." I told myself that again and again. {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}I feel so wrecked; I feel like everything has burnt out. {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}I told myself that there's no such thing as love for me. {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}After crying and laughing for such a long time, I fell asleep. {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}I say your name over and over again alone. {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}I'm like a fool... just like a fool. {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}I don't know why I do this for several days. {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}I miss you so much that it's driving me crazy. {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}I just want to forget you, I must be really crazy. {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}It's hard... It's too hard. {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}That's why these tears keep blocking my view. {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}Your figure haunts me... {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}Now, it's about time to forget you. {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}I don't have to go through hard times like this, but why? {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}Like a fool... {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}Just like a fool. {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}I cannot forget you, just why? {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}When I can't even ask you to come back... {\a6}{\3c&H8000FF&}I... Song Yi Kyung. Long time no see. You haven't changed a bit. Yi Soo... It's you. How... how can this happen? How can this happen? Why didn't you come earlier? Why didn't you come earlier? This is the right time for me to come. I could only come now. Let's go. There's somewhere we need to go. Where? Today... just do what I say. At that time, I was really excited. I was living the rock life, while experiencing a whole new world. That period of time... had really let me feel hateful towards life. You still had to be my guardian, you must've been really tired. You were still young then. You were young as well. The distance between us was too great, I thought that we couldn't solve our problems through conversation. So I decided, to clearly show you my sincerity. When I was living the rock lifestyle, I did fool around, but you were like my hometown. So... I bought a wedding ring. Your hand. Right. Next... Why are we here? We haven't ever, gone to a theme park together. Because we had no money. Even so, you want to go here now? That year, on your birthday, didn't we promise to come here together? Song Yi Soo did. {\a6}{\3c&H71C554&}As always I am watching you. {\a6}{\3c&H71C554&}As always I am watching only you. {\a6}{\3c&H71C554&}Even though, {\a6}{\3c&H71C554&}this love is not mine. {\a6}{\3c&H71C554&}All the things I have not been able to say, {\a6}{\3c&H71C554&}the words that I want you, {\a6}{\3c&H71C554&}the words I cannot erase. {\a6}{\3c&H71C554&}I love you, {\a6}{\3c&H71C554&}please come back to my side. {\a6}{\3c&H71C554&}Even if I cry like a fool, {\a6}{\3c&H71C554&}even if I keep pleading, {\a6}{\3c&H71C554&}I know that nothing will change. {\a6}{\3c&H71C554&}I just can't let you go. {\a6}{\3c&H71C554&}I can't let you go. Where are we going now? You're still the old you, always asking questions. Our Song Yi Kyung. I said before, don't ask, and don't be angry. Just come with me. This place... is our home. Buy some groceries. I miss your cooking. You want me to buy them alone? This time, I won't walk away without a word. What are you going to do by yourself? I have stuff to do alone. I can finish it before you come back. Has the person living here moved? No. I'm just applying a new wallpaper. Then Miss Yi Kyung? No... Where's the owner? Went off for some stuff. Excuse me, may I ask, have we met before? Ah, I'm doing work, stop asking me questions. Do not come here today and tomorrow. Come after a few days. Then please help me tell her that a person named No Kyung Bin looked for her. If you will leave, I'll pass the message. If you keep nagging, I won't. Punk, he has good taste. Doctor? Even so, you're a widow so no. My Yi Kyung is a special Yi Kyung. Yi Soo. Yi Soo? Song Yi Soo. I'm here. I renovated the house so I'm covered in dust. Did you do this? I used my wallpaper skills that I accumulated doing part-time jobs a long time ago. That's not what I meant. I'm asking why did you make this room like that? I'm going to live with you anyway... Because even if we stay for a day, I would want to stay in a clean place. Ah, why was your room like that? It was so clean and tidy before. The rest... design it to your liking. {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}When I want to feel you on my fingertips, {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}I keep forgetting and forgetting everytime, {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}that I can never touch you. {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}You know? {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}I have you in a room inside my heart. {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}Only you can live there, {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}and no one else. {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}Even the memories are lost. {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}Now, even the warmth is gone. {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}I'm standing on one foot like a scarecrow. {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}Without you in my heart, I'm sad like a scarecrow. {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}In the wind, I keep swaying. {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}Even though my body is scattered. {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}If you were to come someday, {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}I want to hold you with open arms. {\a6}{\c&H17B9FB&}I'll wait for you. Did I wake you up? I'm awake. Then, let's go for a walk. Why? Because it's fascinating. I thought I was in a dream yesterday, and you were by my side until morning. Under the sunlight, I can still see you, and touch you. But I'm still a dead person. I waited 5 years just to see you, and to give you, this ring. I loved you. "I've never thought about anyone else, but you. Let's get married." Just to say those words. But, it's different now. The words I want to say have changed. Until then I loved you, starting from now, I won't love you. I don't want to leave you with scars. For you to forget me, and live happily, I waited 5 years. No... Don't be like this, Yi Soo. I'll leave with you. We can't leave together. Even if you choose death to leave with me, it would be goodbye. Death is like this. Over here... It's hard living alone, I can't stand it anymore. Just bear it for me. I have to let you go, so that I can become happy in my next life. If you're unhappy, my heart wouldn't be relieved, it won't be at ease. I was born a bad-tempered, and selfish chap. I couldn't receive love, and I couldn't love others. Such an unfortunate life. Throw away the ring. No. Throw it away. It's already a meaningless item. It is only a thing, to clear your misunderstanding. Don't be like this! {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}I choke, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}and finally swallow. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}The words "I love you". {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}Floating in the wind, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}trying to get away, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}are the words "I want to see you". {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}The words I couldn't say, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}become a long sigh, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}floating in my heart. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}Tears keep falling, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}painful tears are falling. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}My heart's hurting, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}hurting so much because of you. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}On the day I miss you, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}on the day I miss you this much. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}I want to see you. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}and tears fall. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}You're breathing. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}You're living, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}in my heart. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}My heart is beating. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}You're walking, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}in my heart. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}Since the first day you came to me, I've been longing, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}you're calling me. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}Tears keep falling, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}painful tears are falling. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}My heart's hurting, hurting so much because of you. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}On the day I miss you, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}on the day I miss you this much, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}I want to see you, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}and tears fall. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}They keep running down, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}you're running down, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}getting to my heart, you're overflowing in my heart, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}turning the painful tears, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}into longing tears, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}in my heart, you're living like that. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}Tears keep falling, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}painful tears are falling, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}because I love you, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}because they're tears of love. {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}Even if you're beside me, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}like this, even if you're beside me, {\a6}{\3c&H808040&}the words, "I love you" are left unsaid. You know how important you are to me. Instead of being a person abandoned by me, but to me, you were the most important, a great person. So... you will be for others. You're going to be a super important person. Promise me that you will become happy for me. So that I can leave this world without any regrets, so that I can start fresh in my next life. Yi Kyung... Please be happy for me. Meeting a person like you... I was grateful, and happy. I... can only feel guilty. I only received from you, and never gave anything in return. Give back to a person that loves you. Instead of me, return it to that person. Mother. I'd wanted to bring you away after I became successful, I'm sorry. Mr. Kang Min Ho. We're here to arrest you for embezzling and misconduct offense. What do you mean arrest? I thought you said it was a petition... Cuff him. Hold on. Let me meet my mother once before leaving. Just for a while. Mother, did you hide the document that Jin Young brought? Who are you? Before I come back to get it, you can't give it to anyone else. Look at me. Don't give it to anyone except this face. Got it? Min Ho! My child. Did you repatriate after studying for that MBA? Why didn't you say anything when you came back? However sick I am, I wanted to fetch you from the airport. Mother. Did you receive the money I sent? There wasn't enough to spend right? No. Aigoo, you're afraid that I would suffer, just like the old you that's always lying. Then... you've got MBA, so you're a doctor? I knew that you would have a great future. You've never worried me. Not everyone can be first in the whole school. Mo... Mother. I know that you're different from your father. Aigoo, my dear child. Thank you, my dear. Min Ho has been arrested, in his mother's ward. According to the victim's statement, your secretary, Shin In Jung, is your accomplice. That's not true. The person who provided information on the Shin's investments, isn't it Miss Shin In Jung? No. Bear it for me. I have to let you go, so that I can be happy in my next life. Yi Kyung, be happy for me. I'd like to... When you're tired, just like this, think about how regretful I was, just live on with confidence. But she doesn't remember that period of time, I'm afraid that she won't remember you as well. Unni. Yi Kyung unni. Ji Hyun. You came to visit me? You remember me? Unni. You remember me, but you don't remember Han Kang? You remember that person as well? You do remember, why do you pretend you don't? Because... I'm going to die soon. {\a6}I know I can't. {\a6}I need you. {\a6}I'm just afraid that we can't move on. Brought to you by Fighting!

Shin Ji Hyun, what are you doing here? Han Kang, let me borrow you for one day, as my boyfriend. Oppa, let's stop this madness. I can't give up like this. Even if I was shred to pieces, I would still go on. You're the Scheduler, right? You forgot me already? I remember. Why do I remember the 49 days?
