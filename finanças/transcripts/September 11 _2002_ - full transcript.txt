11'09"01 SEPTEMBER 11 11 directors from different places and cultures. 11 perspectives on the tragic events in New York on September 11, 2001. 11 viewpoints engaging their individual conscience. Full freedom of expression. Hurry up! America wants to bomb Afghanistan! Let's build a shelter. The well is drying up. We can't make more mud. Somebody fell into the well and died. Another person went to help him but he fell and broke his leg. One person didn't die. Two people died. Aman's father and Chaman's father. Chaman's father hasn't died yet. He just broke his leg. One man didn't die. Two people died. Teacher is coming. Teacher is here. Hold this, let's take it. Come to class, children. You can't stop atomic bombs with bricks. We are Afghans all right, but we are refugees in Iran. Come on, let's go! It's getting late, so come to class. It's 8 o'clock. Is there anybody there? Hassan? Where are the other pupils? I don't know. I'm putting out the chairs. Where are they? Go and call them. Come to class. Why aren't you at school yet? Here, take this book. Come to class and I'll give you books. Hello. I will give them books if they come to school. - Do you want some tea? - No, thank you. Books? Okay, come to class and I'll give you books. Come and get the books I've brought. There are three million Afghan refugees living in Iran. Whatever happens to them will happen to you too. Come to class. You can't stop atomic bombs with these bricks. Hello, hello. Send the children to class. Children, important news. A big incident took place in the world. Who knows anything about it? I do. Tell us, Esmat. Someone dug a well and two people fell in and died. They're dead. Teacher, can I speak? Speak. Someone dug a deep well. Then two people fell in. One died and the other broke a leg. No, a more important event. Who knows anything? Najeebeh, you tell us. Teacher, let me whisper it in your ear. No, dear, say it aloud for everyone to hear. Let me say it in your ear. No, say it aloud. They buried Auntie in the ground up to her neck in Afghanistan and then stoned her to death. They buried her aunt up to here in Afghan soil. No… a more important global incident. A very big one. Excuse me, teacher. It rained, a flood came and everyone was killed. No, children. A very important global incident. One that could trigger World War III. They may drop the atomic bomb and we'll all be killed. In America, in New York City, two airplanes hit the World Trade Center towers. Do you know what a tower is? Everyone look outside. A tower looks like the chimney of this brick kiln. Now look at me. Now that you know what a tower is, which one of you knows who destroyed those towers? Can I say it, teacher? God destroyed them. No, God didn't destroy them. God doesn't only destroy humans. He builds them too. God only destroys humans. God hasn't got airplanes. He builds humans. Quiet, children. Listen to me. Look at this. This is a drawing of a clock. From here to here is one minute. Are you listening? We'll keep silent for one minute in honor of those killed in New York. Listen! We'll keep silent for one minute. The minute starts from right now. God creates first, then destroys and then He makes again. No way. God is not crazy enough to kill people and remake them. Quiet! I told you to keep quiet! It's good that you are children. Keep your innocence. Excuse me, he's spoiling the silence. Does God kill? Does He kill? God hasn't got airplanes. God snaps His fingers like this and people die. God's not crazy enough to kill people. Well, God kills people so He can create new people. -Why doesn't He keep the old people? -Hmm? He wants to make new people. It's none of your business. God is God and can do as He wants. One minute is over but you children didn't stay silent. A victim was buried alive under the rubble and asked for help with a mobile. Do you know what a mobile is? You can dial a number. It is a kind of cordless phone. Someone from under the debris was calling "Help, help!" Since you didn't keep silent, let's go and stand under that chimney to see if you can remain quiet or not. Look at the chimney. Think of all those people in the towers who died under the rubble. Let's start. What do we do if we want to talk? Just bite your lips and look at the chimney. What's his name? Piano. He loves it when I play. Is it your first time in New York? Yes. How did you become a tour guide for the hard of hearing? My kid brother is deaf. Back in France, what do you do? I'm a photographer. What kind of pictures? All sorts. What's that? It can play on its own too… Did you feel something, lying down on the piano? Vibrations… like being caressed. Nah, sorry, I can't this morning. I'm showing a group around Downtown and the World Trade Center. Maybe this afternoon. I mean, I live a couple of blocks from the towers. Okay. See ya. Is it the good weather that makes you so sad? I never thought the end would come so soon. The end of what? The end of the world. The end of a couple is always the end of the world. Why don't we talk it over tonight? If you come home. Why wouldn't I come home? Last night, a voice told me you wouldn't come back. You're hearing voices now? It's the privilege of the deaf. You're so jealous it's unbearable. You're jealous of everything… the phone… even the piano! How could I not be threatened by those women you show New York to? Even if they are deaf and dumb. Can I say something? I'm finding this world of silence more and more deafening! How dare you say that to me? You who are lucky enough to speak, and listen to Mozart! Jerome, I cannot recall who said: "I knew what happiness was on hearing him leave…" I suddenly remembered it, a few minutes ago, when you slammed the door… That door which I stared at, so impatiently, every night for a year. A year… just yesterday… Do you remember? I had come to New York for the first time with a group of deaf-mutes. We watched this crazy city from your bus. Miracle of the Indian Summer? Anyway, that day… I saw nothing but you. Your movements were those of a conductor. It was the most beautiful day of my life before the most beautiful of my nights. One year later, the miracle has turned into a mirage. America is not made for cripples. She only loves triumphant giants. Towers that reach to the sky. Heroes straight out of Hollywood. So, who am I to you? An outdated extra from an old B&W movie? The little match girl? The little flower girl from a Chaplin film? Just a mute lost in a talking picture? I'm writing to you, since I cannot scream. There were so many words in our silence. This morning, I saw little but silence in our words. Even last night, after we fought, when you slept on the sofa, I could not stop myself taking pictures of you. So I'm leaving you… before you leave me. Unless there's another miracle… What happened? Weren't you watching TV? The police! They'll stop us filming. Didn't you get authorization? I'm sorry. Sorry? Scram before I kill you. While they're talking, shoot what you can. No way! I have to shoot this scene as planned. What are they going to say if I go home without having filmed the World Trade Center? I'm warning you, if you don't stop filming right now, I'll shoot. September 12th at 10 a. m. Press conference with Youssef Chahine Good morning. After yesterday's catastrophe, I can't just talk about an actress's dress or the film in general. Um… Uh… I'd rather postpone this until tomorrow. Maestro, we've been waiting for you. You have to answer us. Please excuse me. What happened yesterday has upset me… I have to think. Think, or dodge our questions? What did you feel yesterday, seeing the towers collapse? It was as if I'd foreseen it. Did you also foresee my and my friend's deaths? Who are you? Who were your friends? Who am I? One of the 280 American marines killed by a bomb here in Beirut in 1983. Why did you choose me to talk to about September 11th? Because you're an Arab. Like those who did it. Maybe so. But Bin Laden and his followers were trained by the Americans. Can I ask you a question? Were you all the same age? More or less. You never had time to enjoy life. Yes, I did. Girls loved me from when I was 16. Uh-huh. And you decided you didn't need love. Love? It was in Beirut that I discovered love. I was dancing with an American chick… when I saw this Lebanese girl… Love at first sight. In a second I was hers. I'd have married her on the spot. Three days later I was dead. I was her first and last love. Want to see her again? I can see her. But she can't see me. You can see me but others can't. Why? You're sensitive to things which happen, to my life, my death. I live in your head. I think I'm sensitive about everyone's life. Where are you buried? In Arlington Cemetery, Washington. Let's join in! Were you thinking? I was thinking about you. Well, not only about you… about all of you. Does it upset you? I'm angry that we don't do enough for others. You've done nothing to make yourself heard. You're right. We've been too soft. Come. When did your son make his decision? Every Palestinian wants to fulfill himself in that way. They attack us with tanks and missiles. We have only rocks. The Israelis fool everyone. They attack us and pretend to be the victims. And that fool Bush lets them decide who the terrorists are. Imagine them destroying your house. Or imagine olive trees planted by your ancestors being uprooted by their bulldozers before your very eyes. Have you ever seen an Israeli solider forcing a father to his knees and crushing his face into the ground in front of his children? And they complain about the violence! The worst violence is their occupation of us. I understand them killing the soldiers occupying their country, but not innocent civilians, like in Tel Aviv or the World Trade Center. America and Israel are democracies. The citizens choose the political system which suits them. For the suicide bomber it's obvious that those citizens are responsible. Do you know the numbers of victims of American violence? 4,000,000 in Vietnam… 1,000,000 in EL Salvador, 1,2000,000 in Iraq. Millions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And an incalculable number in Palestine, Iran and Africa. America should protect its own values, its principles of freedom, democracy and tolerance. But it destroys other civilizations. Defending its own interests. Defending them at whose expense? Always that of others. Only your soul is sacred, and the world owes you everything? No one else deserves even a tear? It's a vicious circle of destructive stupidity. You have to understand that it's impossible to go back in time. I'm sorry, but we can't do anything. I can. Sure, going back in time with just a click. But who could resuscitate the dead? Maestro? What are you doing here? Looking for your fiancé, Danny. Danny? Where did you meet him? Let's find him first. Danny hated being alone. That's why we came. Where did you meet him? Here. Can you see him, too? When I concentrate very hard. He was a lovely boy. Did you know him? I'm his father. You visit the tomb of a soldier who wanted me dead? You're victims of human stupidity. Are you comparing us? If Danny and his parents had understood, you'd be alive. If Hitler had understood, the Americans in Vietnam, the Serbs, the Israelis, too… Remember my mother's eyes? If humanity means anything to you, never forget them. Selma! Selma! Don't shout outside the house! What will the neighbors say? Put the doorbell lower and I'll ring it. It's not my house. You only have to knock. -Okay. Is Selma there? -No. She went out at dawn. She must be at the river. Again? Didn't she sleep? No. Neither did I. It's always like this on the 11th. Coming in for coffee? I'll call her. No, don't disturb her. Here, I've got some stuff for you. There was some make-up in the aid package. Share it between you. You haven't even had a coffee. How are you? Fine, except I've got blisters on my feet. I need some new shoes! You're here? You haven't seen my big sheet of paper, have you? No, but it's not surprising, you still haven't emptied your boxes. You should unpack them. I'll do it when I get back home. Home… Will we ever go home? You can't carry on like this. You've been living out of those boxes for six years. Here, look what Nedim brought. Creams and lipstick… Is that supposed to be for a man? Take what you like. I'll make some coffee. I can't find my sheet of paper. If you'd unpack your boxes you'd find it. Hanka, just give me a break! You act like we're going home tomorrow. The neighbor told me they've burned Galib's house again. He's only just redone the roof. If a man can't do it, how would we manage, all alone as we are? There's nothing we can do, Selma. -Where are you going? -I know where that paper is! You haven't drunk your coffee. See you in the square at 4:00. Always the same, the 11th of every month. Demonstrating, demonstrating… As if anyone cared about us! You want us to act like nothing's wrong? Nedim, you scared me! You scared me, too. -What are you doing here? -Nothing. Just thinking. You really scared me. Where are you going? To the square. Did Hanka give you the make-up? Yes, thanks. Where are you going? Into town. Do you want a lift? Some journalists promised to come to the meeting. - From the TV? - I think so. Don't worry, If they're from the TV I'll bring them to the square. ASSOCIATION OF THE WOMEN OF SREBRENICA After the second crash, there's no doubt… This was a terrorist attack on the United States. There are believed to have been many victims in the collapsed towers. The exact number of people who work in the towers is not known at the moment. But it is thought to be in the thousands. Horrific scenes from New York… We just have learned from the television… …that another plane has crashed, this time apparently into the Pentagon, but this hasn't yet been confirmed. It's total confusion. If true, it means this was a widespread attack on the United States. After this, we can expect anything. The American President will be addressing the nation from Florida. Pictures coming in from New York show people running in the street… There are many wounded, blood everywhere… Everyone is covered in dust. For those just joining us, I repeat that two airplanes have crashed into New York's Twin Towers, one of which collapsed only ten minutes ago. An unconfirmed source tells us that yet another plane has crashed into the Pentagon. The number of victims isn't known. Where are you going? To the square. Sit down. There'll be no demonstration today. You can hear what's happened. Exactly. We have to demonstrate. For them and for us! A tragic day for the United States. A tragic day for us all. Selma! Have you heard? Yes. The poor things. West Africa - Burkina Faso September 11th 2001 This terrorist attack is without doubt the most extensive and most murderous ever. Several important buildings in the United States, the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, have been hit by regular commercial airplanes. The World Trade Center has been reduced to rubble and the Pentagon is badly damaged. It is not yet known who was behind these attacks nor the number of victims, but there could be over a thousand. George W. Bush has vowed to hunt down and punish the perpetrators… What's he saying? Maniacs! Some planes have crashed into building higher than our presidential palace. There'll be many dead. The world's gone crazy. I need 200 francs. I have to buy two pens, a pencil and two notebook covers for school. Where would I get 200 francs? Out of thin air? You've gone crazy too! How's your mother? Not getting any better. What are you doing here then? Go to her! Adama! I haven't got 200. Here's 100. Thanks. How is she today? The nurse came earlier. She left lots of prescriptions again. But how are we supposed to pay for them? I'll find a job. Buy your paper! Read all about it! The brains behind September 11th has a name at last! Osama bin Laden! Read all about it! Only 200 francs! Read all about bin Laden! Thursday's paper! Get your copy now! -Look, it's Adama. -It really is him. Come on! Yesterday our homework was history and geography. He got a zero! I don't like them. Why don't you come to school anymore? We all thought you were sick. It's my mother who's very sick. I have to work to look after her. We'll be late for school. See you tomorrow, Adama. Buy Thursday's paper! Only 200 francs! Read all about Osama bin Laden! THE USA OFFERS 25 MILLION DOLLARS Huh? -He's here in Ouaga! -Who? -Osama bin Laden. -What, here in Ouaga? Stop telling lies, Adama. You've gone crazy. He couldn't be in Ouaga. I swear! I saw him with my own eyes. I swear on my grandparents' graves! No, I don't believe you. There's a reward of 25 million dollars for his capture. 25 million! 25 million dollars? How much is that in francs? Let's work it out. - You multiply it by 600… - No, 700. 25 million dollars. It's impossible! You couldn't count it! What will we do with all that money? Take care of Adama's mom, for one thing. -How many children are like Adama? -Thousands. -How many die of malaria? -Or AIDS? Or meningitis? Millions. Lots of ways to use the money. -Shell we tell our parents? -No. You know what they'd do with the money. Women, villas, cars, cigarettes… That's what they'd do with it. I've got an idea. There he is! It's him, isn't it? Bin Laden! Yes, it's him. Get filming then! How does this thing work? Just open it and press "on". It's working. Mom… -Auntie… -Hmm? These are my classmates. They've come to say hello. That's very nice. Thank you. Mother says thank you. - Did you get him? - Yes. Great! Come on. Yeah! This time we've got him. He goes there every afternoon. We knew that already. So that's where we'll capture him. You, Ibrahim, bring a rope. I'll bring a gun. My dad's got two. Rodrigue, Alex and I will bring spears, okay? Yes. You two, that way! You two, over there! He's not coming back. Goodbye, 25 million dollars! No! We'll capture him at his hotel. He's getting away! The airport! Where are you going? Sir! Bin Laden is here in Ouaga. He's getting away. It's true, he's here. We're not lying. Bin Laden isn't in Ouaga. Now get out of here! Here's the proof. Bin Laden isn't in Ouaga! Now get out of here! Bin Laden, come back, please. We all need you here. Now he's going to get caught somewhere else. No Osama bin Laden. And my mother's still sick. I heard that George Bush is coming on an official visit to Ouagadougou. We could kidnap him for the ransom. Do you want to get the whole country bombed? I've got a better idea. We could sell Rodrigue's dad's camera. We don't need it now. He'll send us to prison. Don't worry. He's already bought a new one. Adama will be able to come back to school with us and buy medicine for his mom. Now that's a good idea! Dear mothers, fathers and loved ones of those who died on September, the 11th, in New York. I'm a Chilean. I live in London. So I like to tell you, we perhaps have something in common. Your loved ones were murdered, as mine were. And we hear a date. September 11th, Tuesday, September 11th. In 1970, there was an election. I was 18 and I voted for the first time. We had this beautiful dream, to build a society in which our people could share the bulk of their work. The wealth of the country. So in September 1970, we all went to vote and we won. ♪ Flags fill the air ♪ ♪ Red, white and blue ♪ ♪ When our story starts ♪ ♪ In every street ♪ ♪ On every corner ♪ ♪ Voices rose like waves ♪ ♪ In an endless ocean ♪ ♪ Borne on the air ♪ ♪ From the mountain to the sea ♪ It was milk and education for the children. Unused land was given to landless peasants. Coal, the copper mines and the main industry became owned by all of us. For the first time in their lives, people had dignity. I've got every confidence in the people's intelligence. People who are organized are intelligent. So how can you be afraid of a people's organization? But we didn't know how dangerous that was. Your Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, announced, "I don't see why we should stand by and let a country go Communist due to their irresponsibility with its own people." Our democratic decision, our votes were not relevant. The market, the profits are more important than democracy. From that moment onward, our pain and your pain was legalized. Your President Nixon said he would make our economy scream. He told the CIA to play a direct role in organizing the military uprising. A coup d'état. Ten million dollars, more if necessary, were available to get rid of our President, Salvador Allende. Friends, your leaders set out to destroy us. They provoked a transport strike that almost paralyzed our economy. They stopped all trade between us, which created chaos. They worked with those in our country who would not accept our victory. Your dollars supported neo-fascist groups who brought violence to the streets and bombed factories and power stations. Amazingly, it didn't work. Allende, Allende, the people will defend you! I'm a Chilean and I have to defend Allende's government. It's a government of the people. We are defending our right to build a future of freedom and justice. In municipal elections, we actually increased our support. So what do U.S.A. do? On September the 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country and night fell on a different world. A world where freedom itself is under attack. On September 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war, against our country. At first light on that morning, troops and tanks advanced on our Presidential palace. Allende, his ministers and advisors were inside. Allende did not flee as the Moneda Palace was fired. They have the power. They can enslave us. But social progress cannot be halted, not by crimes and not by force. History is ours. It is made by the people. Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers! He was murdered. He was murdered. Tuesday. On Tuesday too. 11th of September, 1973. A day that destroyed our lives forever. I got shot through my knee and later they smashed my head against the dirt road. They hit me so many times, sometimes I lost consciousness. ♪ You went to work ♪ ♪ On a Tuesday in September ♪ ♪ The streets of Santiago ♪ ♪ Were under siege ♪ ♪ Streets deaf to sound of gunfire ♪ ♪ Streets blind to treachery ♪ ♪ Obvious to death ♪ ♪ You went to work one Tuesday You didn't return ♪ ♪ Today I walk the streets ♪ ♪ I travel from town to town ♪ ♪ Looking for you ♪ ♪ Asking for you ♪ ♪ And in my hands ♪ ♪ A small photo of you ♪ ♪ And in your eyes The old smile I know ♪ ♪ Where are you? ♪ ♪ Where are you? ♪ ♪ On abandoned ground ♪ ♪ Your eyes can't see ♪ ♪ Your body broken ♪ ♪ But your dream's alive ♪ ♪ You went to work one Tuesday ♪ ♪ You didn't return ♪ One day in prison, I pulled myself to the grill and I saw hitman Castro being dragged by the arms. He couldn't walk. He was bleeding from the ears. They broke his bones and then they murdered him. We learned about the torture camps run by officers of the army, trained in the School of the Americas in the U.S.A. We learned about those disemboweled, thrown out from helicopters, of those tortured in front of their children and spouses. Do you know what they did? They put electricity to the genitalia parts. They put rats in women's vaginas. They trained dogs to rape women. And then we learned of the Caravan of Death. The General who went from town to town, ordering execution at random. Thirty thousand were murdered. Thirty thousand. Your ambassador to Chile complained about torture. But Kissinger replied, "Tell him to cut out the political science lectures." General Pinochet, who organized the coup, smiled, and accepted the Secretary of State's congratulations of a job well done. And the dollars started to flow again to Chile. They called me a terrorist. Sentenced me to a life imprisonment without trial or defense. I was released after five years, but I had to leave my country for the safety of my friends. I cannot go back to Chile now, even though it's all I think of. Chile's my home, but what will happen to my children? They were born here in London. I cannot sentence them to exile like I was. I cannot do that now. But I long to go home with all my heart. Saint Augustine said, "Hope had two beautiful daughters… Anger and Courage. Anger at the way things are. And Courage to change them." Mothers, fathers and loved ones of those who died in New York. Soon it will be the 29th anniversary of our Tuesday, 11th of September. On the first anniversary of yours, we will remember you. I hope you will remember us. Pablo. Holy shit! Holy shit! Come on! Holy shit! At the World Trade Center, we have something that has happened here. Flame and an awful lot of smoke from one of the towers. I'll tell you from the size of the gash… The wings just have to be at least a 150 to 200 feet wide. - Oh, my God! The next building… - Oh, there is another one. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Another plane just flew in. I feel the heat. The explosion is incredible. Oh, my God! - Another plane has… - Oh, my God! The World Trade Center have been hit by aircraft, they both are in flames… I'm seeing bodies falling out of the building. There's people jumping out of windows. - I've seen at least 14 people jumping out. - People jumping out. People just kept jumping and jumping, you could see they were alive 'cause they were flailing around. People on the street where I was standing, we saw the first person jump from the building. Everybody was jumping, it was crazy. Jill, there's a fire at work. I love you. I will always love you. I don't know if I'm gonna be okay, girl. I love you so much. Michelle? Michelle? Break the window. Honey, are you there? Zach? Pick up, sweetie. Okay. Well, I just wanted to tell you I love you. We're having a real problem on the plane. I just love you more than anything, just know that. Just a little problem, so… I just love you. Please tell my family I love them, too. Bye, honey. The World Trade Center, the south tower has totally collapsed. The World Trade Center, just minutes ago, collapsed to the ground. We should hit every country that harbors terrorists. And not only the terrorist camps. I want their fathers to be hit, I want their mothers to be hit. I want their children… Clear the sector! There may be more explosives! Two cars have exploded, car bombs. There's debris everywhere, still burning. A suicide bomber, a bag… Lots of wounded. Send me a team with dogs. Move it! Move it! Ambulance, this way! Come on, come on! Go on, forward! Control center? Head of operations here, Jerusalem Avenue. I'm implementing plan ten. I can see ten wounded on the ground, two bodies… I'll call you back in a couple of minutes. Second ambulance, this way! Come into the sector! Tsahi! One team here, another there. Check from here to there. Don't forget the garbage cans and the roofs. One with minor injuries. Take him away. Bomb disposal, here! Out of the way! Quick! Are you asleep or what? Move it! Wait in the ambulance. Be at the ready! Clear the way to Yihilov Hospital! I repeat: Clear the way to Yihilov Hospital! Clear the area, you're stopping us doing our job! Police, look around! We suspect more terrorists. Check the whole sector. Get out of here, go on! You're stopping us working! Get out of here! Clear the area! You're in our way! Lift the stretcher! Have you checked the roofs? Have you? Come here! The evacuation point in the alley over there. In the alley. Contact the security officer and tell me what's going on. You, go and check the roofs. Then come back and we'll check the junction. Go! Clear the area! Get out of here! Get the wounded into the ambulance. Get ready to leave. Police, this way! Get him inside, get him inside! You can go now! Tsahi, take him, quick! Paramedic, here! Tsahi, here! He's dead? Are you sure? Has he been declared dead? Just a second! Just a second! Okay, forget it. He's dead. Smadar, come with me! Can you tell me what happened? We heard the explosion. I heard… Can you… Sorry? Sorry? Can you tell me…? I want to know if it was a terrorist attack. Are you getting this? We… Watch out! We are witnesses… I was with my crew, filming in the flea market. Tell her to call… Tell her to go home and call my parents. We were at the flea market when we suddenly heard this really loud explosion. Was it a terrorist attack? -A terrorist attack? -What do you think? Get out of here! We suspect another terrorist. I'm telling you for the last time, get out of here! You and your camera! I saw what happened! Get over here and film. I was by the kiosk, a car stopped, he got out… You saw the terrorist? Yes, blond with blue eyes. A handsome guy. Was it a car bomb? He parked so quickly, I thought he was looking for a parking space. We were at the flea market, filming a report about one of Jaffa's biggest bakeries, and we heard… Excuse me! I'm a journalist! I'm a policewoman! Congratulations! But I'm live on the air. The public has a right to know. Move the boom! So… Suddenly we heard… How many dead and wounded are there? Paramedics! Stay with him, wait for the ambulance! Can you tell me how many dead and wounded? I can see a paramedic… Can you… Please get out of the way! Get your hands off, pervert! Don't touch me! We suspect there might be another bomb. Get out of here! Don't touch me! I'm not on the air? Are you crazy or what? Put me on the air, now! Who gives a shit about New York! Are you crazy? Where's my cellphone? Take mine but do me a favor and get out of here! Smadar! Get me the editor! Get him now! Not on the air? Find your phone? But we're right in the middle of a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem Avenue! People everywhere! They come on September 11th to do their shopping, a week before the festival of Rosh Hashana. Where are the ambulances? I want ambulances! I keep waiting and nothing's coming! I want an ambulance, now! Excuse me… How many victims are there? Not very many. Was it a terrorist attack or just… You're in our way! Get out of the way! On September 11th, 1777, Washington was taken by the English, okay? On September 11th… My daughter's on the phone? Tell her to go home and not to worry. I know what happened on September 11th. On September 11th, 1854… 1855, the French took Malakoff. Got that? The French took Malakoff. On September 11th, 1944… On September 11th, 1944… Roosevelt and Churchill met and divided Nazi Germany into three parts: British, American… Get out of the way! You're stopping the ambulances! Go back 100 meters! British, American and Russian. On September 11th, 1997, lightning killed… Excuse me, how many victims? Get out of here, it's dangerous! I don't want to tell you again! On September 11th, 1997… Look, you're not helping! Lightning killed 19 people in India. This isn't the moment. A bolt of lightning killed 19 people. What do you mean, not on the air? A plane hit the Twin Towers? I saw the terrorist. He was wearing a wig, like a singer… Are you sure? A plane hit the Twin Towers? One terrorist attack against another. A plane hit the Twin Towers… One terrorist attack in New York, another here, on Jerusalem Avenue. Jerusalem, the holy city, the city that symbolizes more than any other, the existence of Jewish people. Why can't I get on the air? You're crazy, Tsouf! You're really crazy! You're in our way! But why… You're not getting on the air! Something serious has happened in New York. You're crazy! Don't bother calling the editor. You're not going on the air. How many times do I have to tell you? Something really, really serious has happened in New York. Just calm down and listen to me. Something very serious has happened in New York. A plane has crashed into the Twin Towers. Remember the time and date. 9:00 in the morning, September 11th. No one will ever forget this date. What the hell are you playing at? Family Fortunes? Some dumb game show? I feel sick. Something very serious has happened in New York. Have you gone crazy or what? You're really way out of line! Are you talking to yourself? I'm talking about September 11th, now! Not in 1997. New York, now! A plane has just crashed into the Twin Towers. A plane has just crashed in New York… Allah… If he is alive, show him to me. - Hello, Mr. Bonner. - Hello, Mrs. Hamdani. Any news about Sal? Salim and I think he's been arrested. They've rounded up anybody who sounds Muslim, looks Muslim… Excuse me. Monday, Attorney General John Ashcroft warns… Hello. Assalamu alaikum, Shireen. No news. The news is many of us are being rounded up. Don't keep calling from Karachi all the time, Shireen. Think of your phone bills. I won't talk like that. For you. Thank you, Salim. Mr. Hamdani? Yes? Hi, I'm Sylvia Franko from the New York Post. I'm writing an article on your son Mohammad. Salman? The FBI has issued an urgent hold and detain order for your son Mohammad. For Salman? Yes. They want him in connection with the World Trade Center bombings. We will rid the world of the evil-doers. Hello? - Talat? - Yes, Salim? The FBI is looking for Salman. Yes, I know. I just heard. Yes? I left to teach my English class, and he left as usual at 8:30 in the morning for his research assistant job at The Rockefeller University. He takes the subway in. So, he was probably on the bridge when the planes hit. He would've seen them. He didn't get to work that day. Mrs. Hamdani, you reported your son as missing at the Family Center? Yes, I did. But your son doesn't work at or near the Twin Towers? - No. - He have an appointment there? No. I understand your son was a former police cadet? He was a trained paramedic but he wanted to become a doctor, so… However, he still carried his official police ID card. Now, in one of the files, it says your son is a Pakistani citizen and in another it says he's a British citizen? No. He's an American citizen. He was born in Pakistan but he's an American citizen. Salman is a regular American boy. He likes reading science-fiction books and playing video games. Look. That's him on the football team in high school. And he's a big fan of Star Trek. Star Wars, Mom. Yes, that's what I mean, Star Wars. Please stop playing games with me, I know you have my son. Just tell me where he is. I just want to talk to him. Mrs. Hamdani, I know how you feel. I have three children of my own. No, you don't know how I feel. Until your son walks out of your house and doesn't come back. You cannot know how I feel. Search and rescue efforts continue at the site of the World Trade Center. New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani confirms 218 dead, 5,400 missing, that says the chance of finding more survivors is, in his words "very, very small." See, it's impossible to tell anymore. Could Salman, a quiet man, a Muslim, who worked in a lab, could he fit the profile of a terrorist? Something happened? The papers are accusing Salman of being a terrorist. …college in Germany. You know someone such a long time. Yet you don't know the first thing about them. What is happening? Salman! Salman? Salman! Salman! Salman! Allah! My child! My child! That was my son on the train! That was my son on the train! We will go to Mecca. Allah is kind. He will surely hear us. This is a test of my faith. To commemorate the six-month anniversary of September 11th, they fill the gaping void in Manhattan's skyline. Two slender beams of light, ghost images of the Twin Towers rising above from the ruins of the World Trade Center. What is called the tribute of light has filled a void in many hearts. International law obliges states to take every possible precaution to limit the impact of war on civilians. Israel says this was a fierce fight and its soldiers… Here, this will help us sleep. Human rights workers say the evidence suggests otherwise. Two radically different versions of the same event. One hundred and forty homes destroyed… Now there's no safe place for Muslims anymore. …population made homeless, at a camp where 23 Israeli soldiers died. Have you left the door open for him? Hmm. - Hello? Yes. - Mr. Hamdani. Sir, we have some news about your son, Mohammad Salman Hamdani. Salman? For six months after September 11th, the family of Salman Hamdani suffered from the rumors that he was a fugitive terrorist or in federal custody. But today, the 23-year-old Muslim was remembered for what he truly was, a hero. Mohammad Salman Hamdani, a police cadet and a volunteer emergency technician, had raced to the scene to help. Last week, Hamdani's remains were identified after they were recovered from ground zero. Assalamu alaikum, Salman. It says in the Koran… Allah gives honor to whom he wants and humiliation to whom he wants. What honor you have earned today, perhaps, if your name had been Jesus or David, it would have been a different story. They tell me I should be proud to raise such a noble son. First, they called you a terrorist, and now they call you a hero. You just went to help fellow human beings in need. You are a hero. But then I think, "What does that mean?" If I had raised you with wrong values, at least you would've been alive. Is this the price you pay for raising a compassionate human being? You have honored America… by choosing her as your final resting place. Till we meet again. Allah be with you. I woke up before your alarm clock this morning. I get up early anyway. I get up early, but usually I need your alarm clock. To wake me. It stays too dark. There's not enough light. Huh. That's why your flowers are not doing well. They're like me, you know. I need light to wake up, right? I wish we'd taken that place out in the country. Then you'd have plenty of light. Oh. I forgot all about you, didn't I? And there was light. There you are. Something summer-y. Something summer-y. Oh. Yes, this is it. Oh, my goodness. Yes. Oh. Yes. Yes. Don't you look pretty in that dress. Yeah, please meet Scott… Ah. They don't. They know they don't. I wish they would, though. Horse high, bull strong and pig tight. Yeah, that's how you build a fence. Bit me already, huh? What did I do with that thing? Wait a minute. They ought to... I should've gone there in the first place. Rich people… A bunch of crumbs bound together by dough. Oh, golly, I can't remember the rest of it. Good night, my darling. You remember Paul? That fellow who used to do work for us. Remember? Nice man. Oh, brother. Well, okay. I wonder… I wonder why? Who knows… Who knows why? Hmm? The light! Oh, look! Your flowers. Your flowers. Your flowers, my dear! They're alive. Your flowers. Look, my dear, look. Your flowers. Aren't they beautiful? Darl… Darling. Oh, my dear. You should've seen this, my dear. You should've seen this. I wish you could've seen this. Yukichi… He crawls really well. Mother! He fought for his country. He gave his all for the Emperor. It's terrible. He goes off to war a soldier, comes back a snake. The fighting rages at every point on the horizon. What now remains of my homeland? Even when I returned long ago many had already been killed. More damned rain! -We're soaked. -Let's get home quick. Do you see? What? At night I'm afraid. What are you talking about? At night I'm afraid. You're annoying me. Hurry up! We'll have to lock the door. You've always been a strange one… Anyway, the main thing is that you got back safe. Yukichi, do you want something to eat? Yukichi! He's not Yukichi, he's a snake! I wonder why Yukichi changed like that. He must have seen some terrible things on the mainland. Terrible things? Horrible things. So he preferred to become a snake. I hear that a new sort of bomb fell on Hiroshima. The war will be over soon. The war will be over? Yes. If Yukichi carries on as a snake, I can carry on with you! Your grandfather who died was born in the Year of the Rat. Aren't you ashamed of yourself, eating a rat? The devil take you! I hate you! Get out! Get out! Never come back! We've had a hen stolen! And all our carp have been eaten! It was Yukichi! That's what you say… I heard Kayo was bitten. What if it happened to the children? It's a curse! Seeing what some people get up to… If you've something to say, just say it! Come now… Yukichi was demobilized. We mustn't forget he was an Imperial soldier who fought with honor for his country. If this gets out, it'll bring shame on our village. We have to go and find Yukichi first. We'll discuss it afterwards. Where can he be? Can't find him anywhere. Maybe it's better this way… Sae… Sae… Friend! Friend! Are you so keen to return to the world? What does the Holy War mean to you? Friend! Friend! It's you. Does being a man disgust you that much? Yukichi! Darling! There is no such thing as a Holy War.
