- Ya'll I'm tired I'm finna go sit down. - I really love my grandma Ann she is the best grandma ever she made us some lunches today just in case we get hungry oh she makes the best chicken salad - Oh yes she do and that's great that she makes chicken salad because did you know I was thinking of being a vegetarian. - Kim you're picky about what you goin eat you are crazy about who you go marry girl you had me dying when that boy came up to you and asked you for your number and you looked at his shoes and walked off. - That was so dang funny but I have my face all red when someone comes to me or my best friends. I don't play that way. - And it wasn't just the shoes is it? That boy penis was hanging down so long I was scared to look down you know how am I gonna go on a date with somebody that can't even pull his pants up that is so embarrassing. - Christie yo sure don't play you the best bodyguard we could have but you know what? Grandma Ann is always jelly don't lose your cool think before you act. - You remember that time when that boy let his dog off the leash? And it started chasing us down the street and the next day Chris still introduced him to the Nutcracker? Oh my gosh I was laughing. - But it wasn't funny when that dog was chasing us my knees were on point to the next day he know better than to mess with us again. - You know he was wrong for that too what if that dog would have bit one of my pretty legs? I mean who wants a fashion model with dog bites all over their legs? It could have messed my chance of being the next top model. - Well Chris threw away his chance of having kids he still walks funny all over I kind of feel sorry for him I hate to see people harmed which is what my grandma Ann says I should be a nurse. - I was wondering what I wanted to be when I grew up? Stacey didn't you say you want to be a model? I like modeling too but I think I'll just be an actress or maybe even start my own business. - Kim now I can see you being an actress for sure the way your personality just changes are you still enrolling for summer arts class? - Oh yes acting is so passionate did ya'll see the play that I did last year at school it was great. - Yeah but there aren't lot of female bodyguards I think I might become a police officer Or maybe when we get into high school I'm gonna go into ROTC really girl yes there's a whole bunch of cute guys in that class and they liked me too so. - I don't know about that Crystal 'cause you know if you would have been a police officer, you would have got suspended every week because of your temper but you know I have a lot of clothes so maybe I should be a fashion designer. - But I'll look cute in uniform but you right maybe we should all become models and travel the world just to get out of the neighborhood. - The neighborhood what you talking about? You know when we get older we're gonna look back at these good old times you know grandma Ann always says never forget where you came from. - We have our whole lives ahead of us I'm sure we'll figure something out best friends always so as long as we have each we gon' be A1. - Talking about the neighborhood there goes Jack B coming. - Jack B come here Where you think you going? I know you see us right here. - I am on my way what's ya'll business? Ya'll sitting around like we do when we were five years old where ya'll boyfriends at? - You know we ain't got no boyfriends but you always got jokes where your girlfriend at? - Hey nobody has any excuse or rights on me I am a freelancer but I am thinking about who I'm gonna to take to the prom when I get in high school. - Jack B that's too far from here to there. - Yeah right the way I like every boy within a mile radius is pooling I see you for I heard what Chris used do to do he still walks funny. - At least he's still walking. He let his dog lose on us I wouldn't be too mad. - Now he did what I bet that was funny as hell I wish I could have really laughed at that one. - Yeah it's funny now but it wasn't funny when a dog was chasing us I mean all I was teeth. - I'm just playing baby girl if I had saw that I would have helped ya'll that is if Crystal hasn't clear the see ya'll in the wedding rehearsal. - I'm not hurt actually I'm cool as fan but hey some people be asking for it. - Why you look at lil homie's shoes like that? You know everybody don't got swag like Jack B. - I mean he's nothing like you you know we both know that and did you see his pants? I mean he was sagging so you know every time we look at you it's all good. - You always feel like you stepped out a magazine so how you coming with your record? We heard you was talking with dad to take you to the studio. - It's all good they said the gon' take me on Saturday. I'm going to buy me a studio when I get older and I'm going straight to the top I'm already writing a song for that I got too much time. - We know you had all that going on but what can we do? You know we love to model. - Yes we do and we was just talking about our futures but instead I think I'm just gonna start my own business. - We can do whatever we put our minds to never forget that and as long as we work together the sky's the limit. - I hope we stay in touch with each other after we graduate 'cause most times friends lose touch with each other if they don't go to the same college or even if they just get out touch. - They just happen a lot especially in the entertainment industry one day you're home then the next day you're on a show. - It's time for a group hug I love you guys.

Ya'll keep me laughing. - Jack B just make sure you buy us drinks and popcorn and whatever else we ask for since you gonna be making money now share the wealth brother. - I got y'all ya'll just make sure you don't keep my pockets on broke I know how ya'll eat oh and say hi to grandma Ann and I said her chicken salad is the bomb I need to go say hi to my grandma. - Everybody love my grandma Ann that's what's up ya'll better help me take care of her too 'cause she's sure growing old. - I know right?
