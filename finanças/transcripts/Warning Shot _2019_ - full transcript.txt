How come everyone left so soon? Probably had things to do. There weren't that many people. Most of Grandpa's friends are dead, sweetheart. Come on, let's go. All right, these water rights have been in this family since the 1800s. The old man himself has owned them since, like, 1939. So it's gonna take some persuasion. I want you guys to persuade them. You two know each other? I've seen him around. Had a friend who said he bought a skimpy bag of weed from him. - I don't sell skimpy bags. - Had a bunch of stems in it. Oh, Jesus. All right, uh... Rainy, this is Jawary. Jawary, Rainy. You think you guys can work together? Hey, man, I'm a professional. All right, I need you to loosen the guy up. He's old, all right, do not kill him. Just... just get it done. We need him to sign. - When do you want this done? - Let's do it tomorrow. Around noon. You guys hold him there, I'll come by with the papers. What if he gives us trouble? What did I just say, asshole? Do not kill him. He can't sign if he's dead. I was just asking. Might have a shotgun or something. He's in his 90s. Can you handle a guy in his 90s? Cheyenne, dinner's ready. James and Chris were chasing me and Lucia. They said they were going to throw us into the pond. Oh, really? Well, we'll see about that. What's that? It was on the door. Go wash up. What's for dinner? Vegetable soup. Hey, honey. What did you think about the farm? It was okay. - Just okay? - Yeah. It was fun to run around, and there's lots of places to go. There's crackers if you want some. So, it turns out, Grandpa was a bit of a hermit in his old age. We're probably the only family he kept in contact with. He might leave me something in his will. Really? Like what? Like, I don't know... Mr. Pendleton kinda hinted he might leave me the farm. It's a lot more space over there than in this trailer. Are you working tonight? Yes. Who's watching me? Lucia's mom. Don't let those boys throw you in the pond. Please. Is Marty in his office? - Yeah. - Okay. Would you like some more coffee, sir? No, I'm fine, darling. Thank you. I'll put this right in for you. Have a good day. Got a minute? Yeah, that's exactly what I've got. I'm tied up with this tax mess. I'm down to my last extension. I'm having some hard times financially. Boy, aren't we all? I need to make some extra money. Flirt with the customers. I'm not asking for a raise. I'm just... Maybe you could give me some extra hours. You're lucky to have the hours you have now, Audrey. I got a kid, Marty. I had nothing to do with that, but... I mean, maybe there is a solution. You know, I've... I'm really, really tense right now, and you really need money. We're a match made in heaven. You owe me overtime pay. I told you I'd pay you just as soon as I get my tax refund. I know you have the money. You just bought a brand-new car. Don't you tell me how to spend my money. All right. I'm gonna pay your overtime, but you're just gonna have to wait like everybody else.

What the fuck is wrong with you? What? It's just beer. I'm talking about you carrying them guns right out in the open. Man, nobody saw me. Besides, it's not a gun. This is a rifle. You really think we need an assault rifle for an old man? Here's your weapon. A six-shooter? That's a.38. That's respectable. How come I get a six-shooter like I'm some type of fucking cowboy and get a semi-automatic rifle? 'Cause that's all I got. Besides, that was my daddy's gun. Daddy? You call your old man "Daddy"? Man, what the fuck is your problem, dude? I just thought we'd have a beer together. Where's the bullets? I got 'em, man. I got your bullets right here. Six bullets? This all I get? It's a six-shooter. How many you want? Besides, we're not supposed to kill anybody anyway. Remember? Hey, man, you got any weed? It's all stems, man. Come on, man. You know I was just kidding with you. Besides, I know your own personal stash is the good shit. Oh, yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Let me see that. Nice. There's a little stem right there, but that's all right. Mr. Pendleton is an old friend. He's helping us with Grandpa's estate. My, I never knew he had such a pretty great-granddaughter. - Grandpa had an estate? - Yes. He owned 80 acres. - That's a lot. - Yes, it is. Do you have any plans for it if he leaves it to you? It needs a lot of work. Probably couldn't sell it for a lot. I was actually thinking it might be cheaper for us if we lived there. Hmm. The will won't be executed for another week. So, we'll talk about the specifics then. I was at the funeral. I don't know if you saw me. I did. Thank you. Thank you for the flowers. Yeah, I knew your... I worked with your grandfather my very first job. - We were just boys. - I did not know that. Picking some of the best sweet corn we ever ate. You know, the first time I saw your mother, she was younger than you are now. Really? And, you know, she ran away from me. Seriously? I came by for a visit and she ran away from me. Your mother said you were slow to warm up to people. First ten minutes, I caught you spying on me from around the corner of the house. Another ten minutes, you were offering me a cup of pretend tea. By the time I left, you were hanging on my neck. They had to pull you off me. I guess I warmed up to you finally. Yes, you did. You were a clever one, too. She used a coffee can lid for a Frisbee and got it stuck on the roof. Well, she tied a rope to a baseball mitt and... threw it up there. That... that sounds more like me. Did she ever get it down? Yes, she did. She sure did. An answer has no purpose without a problem, you know. There aren't always answers. Well, I think a clever girl will find one. Sometimes you just have to repurpose a few things. If that doesn't work? Leave it to the wind. It'll eventually blow off whatever is on the roof. But I'm a runner. Remember? But you'll come back. Thank you. Cheyenne... I'm sorry I didn't say anything about it before. But it's not set in stone. What about school? Will I still go to the same school? No. What about all my friends? Honey, I don't know what's gonna happen. All I know is we can't afford the rent anymore. What about Dad? Can we ask him to help us? Your dad doesn't give us any money. If knew we might lose our home then he might. All he would do is try to take you away from me. Is that what you want? Hmm? You wanna live with your dad? You'd still have to change schools. I know the birthday cards from Dad are really from you. How do you know that? No postage stamps or return address. So, you can't threaten me with living with Dad, 'cause I already know he wouldn't take me. You're pretty smart, you know that? Yes. Just don't get a bumper sticker on the car about it. ♪ As I've been digging through a pile of bones ♪ ♪ Trying to find an answer in a broken-up home ♪ ♪ You left cold, yeah, you left me alone... ♪ What's your name, darling? Notta. Notta. Is that Mexican? No. - Notta what? - Notta Chance. You got bird shit on your window. Yeah, why don't you lick it off for me, then? You think I won't? I'll give you ten bucks if you lick that bird shit off. Come on, man. The light turned green. Bitch, you even got ten bucks? I don't think you'll do it. Where's my money? I'll take the rest of it, too. What are you doing, man? Let's get out of here. Remember, I got your address. You call the police, you better hope they find me before I find you. ♪ And it's eating me up inside ♪ All right, coming through. Hey, there we go. Got that... That's the first time you haven't hit the fucking chair. I know. There you go. It'll be all right. Oof. There. All right, you're getting better, getting better. Hey, put it over my feet. - My feet get cold. - Okay. No, the feet are down here, sir. There you go. So, uh... this afternoon, I'm gonna go see the old man. God. I stopped worrying about that old bastard about 30 years ago. We hated each other. But respected each other. Well, you never could get him to sell. Dad could never get him to sell. You trying to tell me you wanna end up like your dad? - I don't... I don't... - You don't want that. - And I don't want that. - No, I don't. I just want to show you that I can run the business. I'm good. What are you gonna do? You know what we did in my day? If you didn't like somebody... you told them right to their face before you loosened their jaw for them. And then they'd take a chair and crack it over your head, if they had any guts. That's the problem today, Bobby. Nobody respects guts anymore. I wanna make you proud of me. You can be proud of one thing for sure. - What's that? - Today... you were number one in the world at hauling me off the shitter. It seems weird Bobby would go through all this trouble for some water. He's just trying to impress his grandfather. Do you have to carry that out in the open like that? You know what? Maybe I'll stick it down my pants. No one will see it next to my dick. Hey, where's yours? If it was up your ass, I bet you'd know where it was. Oh! Damn, brother. What spoiled your taco? Fuck you, man. Hey, yo, so how long did it take you to smear that... That doo-doo across your lip, huh? Shit, I shave twice a day, man. Man, if you shave twice a day, I shit gold bricks. You could hardly tickle a twat with that Velcro-looking thing. Kiss my ass, cowboy. I get more pussy than you can imagine. Ooh, well, well, well. If we're talking imaginary pussy, then I guess you're gonna win. I know you're in there! Hey! You ain't fooling anyone, old man. We know you're in there. I don't think he's in there. I know he's around here somewhere. He's gotta be. We'll find him. You check the woods on that side, I'll come up behind the barn, and we'll meet out by that woodpile. Man, I fucking hate trees. How can you hate trees? - No one hates trees. - I do. I was hiding out from the police once... I was stuck in the woods for weeks. Nothing but goddamn trees everywhere. No one hates trees, man. That's impossible. Hey, you know what I'm gonna do? I'ma piss on this goddamn tree right here. Can you reach that? - Yep. - Oh! Oh! - That's my girl. - Here you go. Thank you, baby. Whose car is that, Mom? I don't know. It might be the lumber company. Grandpa was gonna thin the forest. You don't want to come inside? I just want to go to the swing. Okay, but be careful. It's very old. Cheyenne! Don't bother the bird... I'm right here, Mom. Cheyenne... Baby... Come on, baby. Get in... get in the car, honey. Come on. Baby, run! - Lock the door! - Open the door! - Baby... - Open the door! - Here... - Open the door! We're not gonna hurt you! Open the door! We're not gonna hurt you! Turn off the car, or I'll kill the kid. Put the car into park. Bitch, that was a fucking warning shot. Put the car into park. Unlock the door. - Baby... - Uh-huh. Unlock the door. Everything's going to be fine. - Get out! - Okay. - What are we gonna do with 'em? - Okay... - You see any rope around here? - It's okay. No. Let's start with names. I know you're Cheyenne. That's a pretty name. Is it because you're shy? Hmm? What's your name? - Audrey. - Audrey. That's not so pretty. - What's your middle name? - Hey, man, can I talk to you? Yeah, in a minute. So, where's the old man, huh? - Grandpa? - Yeah, Grandpa. - He died. - Died? Who gets the water rights? Water rights? I-I... I don't know. Whoever he leaves them to, I guess. Well, when will we find out who get 'em? We read the will next week. We can't watch them for a week. All right, man. Come on, let's talk. Okay, first off, I don't like you pointing a rifle at a kid. Really? Well, the old man was once a kid. Well, you was once a kid. So, if somebody's 17, and they turn 18 tomorrow, I gotta wait till tomorrow to be able to point a rifle at them? I've had it with your smartass bullshit. I've had it with your pussyfooting. - Hey, fuck you, cowboy! - Fuck you, Zulu! I was born in America, dumb shit. You don't even know what a Zulu is. I know what it is. It's that dude that plays with chicken bones all day 'cause he's got the best drugs. That's a sangoma, dumbass. It's all the same bullshit to me. Now, what are we gonna do with them? If you sign the water rights over, we'll let you go. We don't even know if she'll get them. If she does, we already have the contract. How 'bout it? Bobby will be here in a bit with the papers. You sign it, and that's it. And what about you, shy one? You know anything about this? Does she talk? - She's scared. - Oh, yeah? Are you mad because I pointed a rifle at you? Yeah, well, if you don't talk, I'm gonna point it at you again. And this time, I might fire it. Damn it, Rainy, I told you not to threaten that kid with the rifle. Hey, you said not to point it at her. Did I point it at her? Go on, shy one. Go ahead, baby, answer him. Me and Mommy can't afford rent, so we thought we might move in here. Oh, isn't that interesting? How do you know you'll get the house? We don't. Was I talking to you? Let her answer. Mr. Pendleton said we'll probably get it because Grandpa was a hermit and didn't have much family left. She'll probably get the water rights, too. Problem solved. All we have to do now is just wait for Bobby. Yeah. I need a fucking beer. God damn... What the hell did the old man eat, chipped paint? There's more mouse shit than food in these cupboards. He was 90. Maybe mouse shit was his secret to longevity. Maybe you should eat some, cowboy. Oh, yeah? You think I won't? How much? I told you I don't have any money. You have some beer in the car, you remember? Yeah, that's right. Why don't you go get it for me? Fuck you. Audrey... why don't you go get my beer? Untie me. She's got wit. I like that. I like that a lot. Hey, man. Why don't you step out for a spell? Hey, man, we didn't come here for that. Yeah, I know, but... you know... Leave her alone. I see. You draw the line at pushing around old men. Just leave her alone. Don't worry. It's for him, not for you. Just in case. Fuck y'all. I'll get my own beer. Fuck you. Ah, yeah. Nice. Loud ass fucking birds. Hey, man. Why didn't you tell me you were firing one up? You didn't ask. Let me get some of that. Hey, man, maybe it'll mellow you out. Goddamn, this shit could bore a hole through a bank vault. Nah, man, it's an acquired taste. Hey, you want some? No, thank you. You sure? It'll loosen you up. Get the tension out. Believe me, darling, you look like you under a lot of pressure right now. - How 'bout you? - She doesn't want any. I didn't ask you. Suit yourself. You know what you are, cowboy? A glut. You don't know when to quit. Hey, man, if you wanted it back, all you had to do was ask. You don't got to get personal. Here. Move over. - Are you comfortable? - No. Would you be comfortable with two criminals in your house? This isn't your house yet, remember? Besides, Jawary isn't really a criminal. The worst thing Jawary's ever done is sell skimpy bags of dope. I told you I don't sell skimpy bags. My friends don't lie. Your friend's a lying sack of shit. Nothing wrong with getting a little extra out of the deal. Is there, hmm? All we have to do is wait for Bobby. You want to fuck up something that simple? Man, you a real killjoy, you know it? Just chill out, man. Why don't you take a nap? Man, he was so annoying. He's gonna be real pissed when he wakes up. Please don't hurt us. I don't want to force myself on you. Okay? All I want... all I want is for you to ask for it. Go on. Go on. Ask for it. I don't know what you want me to say. I want you to ask for it. I can't. You can. And you will. Cheyenne, can she please leave? Nah, fuck that. You can say it in front of shy one. She's too young to understand anyway. I can't. Huh? All right. Come on. Sit here and see what happens next. I don't... I don't know what you want me to say. I'll do whatever you want me... Maybe Cheyenne will ask for it. No... please! No! I don't know what you want me to say! Come on, Cheyenne. Let's leave Audrey here to think about things. No, God, please! I'll say anything you want! Please! Please take me! Take me! Take me! My God! Take me! Well, if you're gonna beg... I knew my charm would wear you down. Baby... I need you to be really strong for Mama right now, okay? Okay. Come on. Shh, shh, shh. Let's go. Sit down. Be quiet. It's okay. Take a deep breath. It's okay. What's this? Why, a pamphlet. Whatever could it be about. Hello, sir. My name is David. I just wanted to leave you with some literature, and to ask if you had heard the good news concerning our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ? Do you know what country you're in? - I'm sorry? - It's a simple question. David, do you know what country that you are in? - This is America. - That's right. This is America. I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure what you're getting at. Did you see that church on the corner down there? I sure did. It's, uh, it's a really lovely, big... Well, that's one of a million on damn near every corner in this country. Do you really think that you're gonna run into someone who's never heard of Jesus fucking Christ? Hey, I'll tell you where you need to go. You need to go to one of those remote areas in Africa where they have all those crazy tribes where they worship tigers and shit. That's where you'll find people that never heard of Jesus. Okay. Sorry to bother you. You wanna know why Christians don't like to go down to those places to proselytize? Because you'll get a spear in your ass. That's why. They'll make a necklace out of your fucking head. I'll move on. Have a good day, sir. You saw something, didn't you? - What? - Don't act stupid with me. You just saw something, didn't you? I don't know what you're talking about, sir. I'll leave now. Thank you. That's why I hate people like you. You will just lie like the devil the second it suits you. Now you're thinking about running away like a little pussy, aren't you? Huh? Now, I'm not trying to be an asshole, I just... I just want you to admit that you lied. Now Audrey here did something to tip you off, and then you acted like you were leaving when you were really going for help. And then I asked you if you saw something and you lied. I-I-I don't know what-what's going on here. I-I don't know what any of this is about. This is about you lying and not being able to admit it. Okay. Okay. I admit it. I'm sorry. I admit it. I lied. Well, now, that's not a very sincere admission now, is it, David? I don't know what you want me to say. There's a lot of that going around. I just want you... to admit... - you lied! - Stop it! Please leave him alone! I just want a little bit of sincerity, David. Is that too much to ask? I... I saw her looking out the window. I'm sorry. She was looking out the window. I... I didn't know what to do. I was afraid. I didn't want to get involved. I was... I'm... I'm sorry. Did you hear that, Audrey? Mr. Christian here was gonna leave you here to rot. I bet you wish all that creative bullshit really worked right about now, don't you? Huh? Hey, cowboy. I oughta blow your fucking head off. Come on, Zulu. You're not mad over that little bump on your head, are you? I was just trying to get a little bit of alone time with my lady. Who the hell is this? Oh, that's my new friend David. He likes to preach the Gospel when he isn't... I owe you a whack. Hey. What are you doing out of bed? Where's your wheelchair? I gotta walk around a little bit. Get the blood flowing. I find busyness... It's a disease. - Yeah. - Busy, busy, busy. Something I gotta take care of. Yep. I remember being busy... when I built all this. I was a busy man. Everywhere at once. I had nothing and I wanted it all. I know. I know. You told me. My dad... we didn't get on very well. But he told me, "If you want a million dollars, you better put in a million dollars' worth of work. Yep. I worked that hard for a long time so that you guys wouldn't have to. Now I'm not sure I did the right thing. Don't say that. We got money. That's power. Nobody fucks with us. Everybody thinks getting power is gonna be by being lucky. You know, hitting the jackpot, winning the lottery, picking a stock. Nobody thinks about the hard work. Nobody thinks about the sacrifice. Nobody saw me digging wells in mud so deep I couldn't even get my boots out of it. Yeah, I bust my ass. It was all about the water and the pipes. And they worked us like a chain gang. Somebody told you when you could take a break. Somebody told you when you could get a drink of water. And I decided right then, someday I was gonna have all the water. And I was gonna dig in the ground until the ground bled because no son of a bitch was ever gonna tell me again when I could have a drink of water. Let's get you back to bed. Come on. A man should have a right to drink water whenever he wants to. How pathetic... How pathetic am I? You know what happens when you get older? You can't stop it. I know. I'm feeling it. - You remember your grandmother? - Yeah. She was right. About what? A vacation. She thought the family should spend more time together, so she wanted us to go to Brussels. To the World Fair. Tell me... no. Um... the expo in 1958. And I argued her out of it and told her, no, I wanted to work harder and we needed to get money for the family and put everybody in better shape than we were in. And, uh, now look at everything. Your dad's in jail. He wanted to make money the easy way. - He didn't want to earn it. - Mm-hmm. Water... why, you just turn on the faucet and you got water. Your grandma was right. Your grandma was a true... one-of-a-kinder. I'm laying here half-dead in my bed... wishing that... I'd had gone to Brussels. Nobody ever dies wishing that they worked harder, but they never tell you what to wish for, so... I think I gotta get going. It was good to spend some time with you, though. You lying piece of shit. It wasn't good talking to me. You were bored shitless. Tell me... walk on out. Will you let us go? That's the plan, but you can't tell anyone. I don't even want the water rights. You could've just asked me for them. I can't take care of all the pipes and filters anyway. We just could've asked for 'em? How did you get mixed up in all this anyway? You seem nice. You watch too much TV, Audrey. Zulu... Put the gun down. You're not gonna shoot anyone. First off, I told you it a goddamn rifle. Don't you know the fucking difference? A rifle. A rifle's got a rifle bore, which causes the bullet to come out spinning like a football. And a gun has got a smooth bore, so it's accuracy is shit. Secondly, I thought you knew me better. What makes you think I won't shoot your ass dead? I took the bullets out. You would think a gun expert like yourself would notice that his magazine was missing. Son of a bitch. Yeah, I was just messing with you. I wasn't gonna shoot you. Have a seat. We wait for Bobby. No. You sit on the recliner. You take the couch. Fine. I wanted the recliner anyway. You really messed things up this time. Me? I was just having a little fun like the old days. You know, rape, pillage, burn and all that. What's this? Hey. You mind if I whittle while we wait? - I thought you hated trees. - I do. That's why I like cutting 'em up. You know what? I'm gonna carve you a little tiki statue. Hey, Audrey. You want me to make you something? Just make your tiki statue. I don't think Jawary appreciates my efforts. Besides... you're much prettier than Jawary. I don't want anything from you. Oh, Audrey, that's cold. You really hurt my feelings. I doubt you have any feelings. That's not true. I'm a sensitive guy. Let me ask you something. If you just met me, and you didn't know nothing about me, would you even talk to me? I mean, if we just met up somewhere, and I just came up to you and you didn't know nothing about me, and we just started talking about simple things, and I didn't do anything to creep you out, what would you think of me? You might fool me. I fool myself sometimes. But I do know you. I know everything I need to know. You're evil. You're cruel and vicious. You're a monster. And I wouldn't want to talk to you. I wouldn't want to see you. I wouldn't want anything to do with you. She struck you down, man. Mom... You got me. You know what, Audrey? I'm gonna make you a little giraffe. You like giraffes? Everybody likes giraffes. I don't know anyone who doesn't like a giraffe. I didn't think there was anyone who didn't like trees. I was in those woods for weeks. Those trees became like prison bars. I don't think anyone's ever had an experience like that with giraffes. Do you like giraffes, Audrey? I don't have anything else to say to you. I can't believe you're gonna smoke that all by yourself. You ever heard of paying for it? Yeah, I paid for those beers. I didn't drink any of those beers. How much you want for that joint? I'll give you $2. - Two bucks? - Yeah. How much you want for it? I'll take the two bucks if you calm the fuck down. So, what church do you belong to? I know it's not Mormon. They travel in pairs. It's the Church of the Living Word. What is that? Is that Jehovah's Witness? Protestant. What do they think about you being a homo? Just as I thought. You know it's a sin according to that Bible. Yes, I do. I'm not. Just like you didn't see Audrey. I bet you spent your whole life trying to get away from it. Spending every day trying to pray it away. No. It's in the eyes. That's not something that you can know about someone by looking into their eyes. Yes, you can. They promised you inner peace, didn't they? And you didn't get shit. Day in and day out in the hot sun for Jesus. And what do you get in return, hmm? High and by on a Sunday and put some money in the plate and see you next week. I get a whole lot more than that. Do you ever feel the Holy Spirit inside you? Here, man, just mellow out. I want this back. Hey, you wanna borrow my knife? No, thank you, cowboy. I got a real knife. A balisong's better than a switchblade. Seriously, dude? My flick to your click-clack? See the difference? Two steps to one. Fan knives are better. More reliable. I'm telling you. Besides, everybody knows that switchblades are cooler than butterfly knives. You can't carve a giraffe with a switchblade. Blade's too flimsy. Do you have to do that in front of my kid? It's just a little coke. Okay, I'll keep it away from her. Don't worry about it, darling. You can't get high off secondhand pot smoke. If you could, we'd all be high off Jawary. I'll tell you what, Audrey. I'll put out this joint if you'll tell me about yourself. What do you want to know? What do you do for a living? I'm a waitress. Now, will you please stop blowing smoke at us? Not until you answer a few more questions. - How many questions? - I don't know. About five. I've already answered one. All right, then we got four more to go. Were you a cheerleader? What does that have to do with anything? I'm asking the questions. No. Were you popular in high school? - That's completely subjective. - No, no, it's not. Whether or not you were popular in high school will tell me virtually everything about you. - How is that? - Because high school is where people are shaped for the rest of their lives. What you were back then versus what you are now tells me everything. Well, I don't know if I would be considered popular or not. Yeah, you do. People know if they were popular in high school. I was valedictorian. See, I knew there was something about you. Then you became a waitress. That tells me a lot. Did you go to college? I went for a couple of years, but then I had to drop out. Look how much we've learned in just four questions. You were valedictorian and you dropped out of college and you became a waitress. Don't think I didn't notice the wording. "Had to drop out." Not "I dropped out." "Had to." Doesn't mean anything. Lots of people drop out of college. Not lots of valedictorians. Had to do with money more than anything else. Valedictorian that can't get a scholarship? - Is that your last question? - No. My last question is did you drop out 'cause you were pregnant? Cheyenne is the best thing that ever happened to me. That's a generic load of bullshit. Let me tell you something, shy one. People lie like the lies are gonna magically turn to money. And nobody lies more than parents. Sounds like someone had a bad childhood. Kids come from fucking. So don't act like you did something noble. Do you like talking that way in front of a little girl? Parents have kids for two reasons... They can't control themselves sexually and kids are cute. And when those little babies start growing up, that shine starts wearing off. And the parents start resenting that burden. That's all parents. Leave her alone. That's not true, Cheyenne... Oh, it is true. It is true. Every parent reaches a point where they long for the freedom that they once had. Where they dream of all the things they could've achieved if they weren't stuck. You know what? You had your last question. Now you let me answer. This is the truth, baby. You listen to me, okay? I may have my regrets in life. I've screwed some things up. I've screwed a lot of things up, but I screwed them up, not you. Yes, I dropped out of college because I got pregnant. 'Cause I couldn't afford it. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, anyway, baby. And being a mother seemed like the best thing I could be. And it was hard. It was tough. And there's times I don't know if we were gonna make it. But I will never regret having you. There's something you're not telling us. Why don't you tell us about your family? I'll tell you about my family if you give me a couple lines. Okay. I gotta hear this. I wasn't no high school valedictorian, I can tell you that. My old man was a con artist. Why am I not surprised? I remember travelling around from place to place, all the time. I was helping him run a shell game when I was only six. I remember he broke into a used car lot office to steal some keys one Sunday afternoon, and some people came in thinking the lot was open. He sold them a car. Filled out paperwork and everything. He even pretended to make a phone call checking on their credit. Banks weren't even open. Damn, Rainy. Your old man had a big ole set of balls on him. I asked why he did it, and he said, "I don't know. Just wanted to see where it went." Where was your mother? I never knew her. So you ran around with your dad? That sounds pretty cool. When I was 12, we broke into a house to rob the place, and it was just supposed to be a woman alone. My dad made me wait in the living room. I could hear her begging. I heard all these noises, and I really didn't know what they were at the time, and her husband came home. And I ran to get my dad. And I opened the door. I saw him on top of her. He was so mad. He threw a pillow at me. I guess the pillow hitting the lamp let her husband know that we were there. He took out a gun. I climbed out the window first, and I hid in the bushes. I heard a shot, and I saw my dad hit the ground. He was just looking at me. His eyes were open, but... I could tell he was dead. That's fucked up, man. I went to a statehouse. I've been a menace to society ever since. "Put up again thy sword into his place. For all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." Is that in the Bible? Yes, sir, it certainly is. Jesus said that. When they came to arrest him, one of his disciples cut off the ear of the high priest's servant. Jesus put his ear back on and spoke those words. He cut his ear off? And put it back on? Praise Jesus, He did. Give me some Kool-Aid and a glass of water, and I'll show you how to turn water into wine. Jesus' miracles are well documented. Same people who made a living off of him. That's kind of like Copperfield's wire pullers claiming he can really fly, isn't it? Lots of people... lots of people saved. Jesus is our savoir. He's a healer. He's healed. You ever hear of the immune system? The immune system cannot make a blind person see. Ever hear of a setup? Faking stuff for money? All those people wouldn't lie. Oh, right. 'Cause people are known for their honesty. Right? Wanna see me do a magic trick? I bet I can make a line of coke disappear. What do you say, bro? Hmm? Put my knife down. Put the log down. Hmm? Come on over. You earned it. Did I ever tell you why I was in the woods for all those weeks? When I was on the run from the cops? - No. - No? Murder. I killed my ex-girlfriend and her lover. I even had to change my identity. You look a little bit piqued there, Zulu. I bet that's the same look my daddy had. Don't hurt us. I'll do whatever you want. Just don't hurt Cheyenne. - Please. - Shut up. My giraffe's not good enough for you, remember? Please, please... there was never any reason for this to escalate into murder. There-there-there still isn't. We can get him some help. He might still be alive. Thanks for pointing that out, David. No! Well, this is just sell-out central here today, isn't it? First Audrey drags you into it, and then you weasel out of helping her, and now, you want to make sure Jawary's dead. Please, please, that's not what I said. That's not what I meant. That's not what I meant. Well, what you mean is to keep yourself alive. Even at the expense of poor Audrey and Cheyenne here. Oh, God. Now, here's what I want you to do. I want you to pick someone, And whoever you choose, I kill and the other two stay alive. What? I... I can't do that. Oh, but you must. You're the one who goes door to door every day asking people to make the most important decision of their lives. - Right there on the spot. - Please... Oh, good God, have mercy. Please, please, please don't do this. Please don't do this. I can't. I can't. All right, then I'll make you choose. - No, please! Shoot me! - Shut up. Shoot me. You wanna shoot someone, you wanna hurt someone... - shoot me. - Mom, no. You're not good enough for me, remember? Shoot me! You cowardly piece of shit. I'm gonna count down from ten to one, and you're gonna choose between Audrey and yourself. And if you haven't made a choice by the time I get to one, then your choice is Cheyenne. No... Please, don't hurt her. - Please. - Shut up. You don't get a choice. The choice is all David's. Are you ready, David? Ten... No, don't do this. - Please don't do this. - Nine! Forgive me for my sins. Bless me. Bless me. Eight! - David, choose me! - Seven. Choose me! Six! Don't do this! Please! Five! - Four! - Just stop it, please! Three! - Stop! - Two! Pick me. What's that? Shoot me. Well, I'm impressed. You finally got some balls. You know what? I'll give you one last chance to change your mind. - Okay? - He's right. He's right. I am a coward. I've been a coward my whole life. Always running away. Always afraid. But I'm not afraid now. Well, look at the bright side. At least you don't have to go door to door no more. I was raped. In college. At a frat party. I was smart enough to get a scholarship and dumb enough to believe this guy cared about me. I went upstairs with him. The music was so loud. I remember his weight. And I remember I couldn't move and I couldn't breathe. It felt like a coffin. So, I turned him into the president, and it was his word against mine. He said it was consensual. And when I wouldn't let it go, they expelled me. So I left, and I gave up. And I'm so mad. I was... And then I found out that I was pregnant. And I wanted... But I didn't... They came... when I saw her... they put her in my arms, she was so small and frail and she needed me to take care of her. So, I... Baby... Thomas... the man you think is your father, he was my first husband. And the truth is he doesn't pay child support because he doesn't have to. He doesn't have to. When we separated, he said he wanted to keep seeing you, and I said yes. And he was helping us out, but then he remarried. And he just quit. He's a good man. I lied to you, baby. Your real father doesn't want to have anything to do with you. And I'm sorry that I lied. I'm a coward. You're not a coward, Mom. I forgive you. That doesn't change anything anyway. Because David has already agreed to go the Jesus route. No one agreed to anything. It's okay. You see? He wants this. He's okay with it. Aren't you, David? Baby... Do you even know how to use that, shy one? You put that down right now. Stop it, darling, you're turning me on. I just love a woman who can wrestle. Get off her! - Who the fuck are you? - Cheyenne. - Who the fuck are you? - David. What the hell's happening here, Rainy? We had some issues. You had some issues? What the fuck's going on? What's... what's going on with Jawary? We got into it, and, uh, I accidentally killed him. - That's not true. - Shut up, Audrey. You don't know what the hell you're talking about. - Where's the old man? - He's dead. Fuck! I told you not to kill him! He was already dead. He died four days ago. Yeah, the will doesn't get read till next week. Why is this asshole pointing a gun at you? 'Cause he got it while I was wrestling with Audrey. She's probably going to get the water rights next week. Well, you know what we can do? Let's just have her sign them real quick and we'll just get out here like nothing happened. Hey, put it down. Drop it. Don't point at me. Down. Other side. Come on. Fuck around. Push it. Push it. - Rainy, get your gun. - Rifle. I don't give a fat fuck if it's Jawary's dick, get it! Untie her. Here we go. Now, what you may not realize is that all wills are retroactive. Ownership legally begins the moment the decedent dies. There you go. That was easy. I'm on my way. Why don't you clean up this mess? We were promised we'd be let go. You were promised you'd be let go? Well, listen, I wanted everything to go real smooth here, but this guy's a real fucking asshole. Rainy, do what you gotta do. No! - Cheyenne! - Shit! - Go! - Go! Go, go! I got him! Boo! I'm gonna miss you, Audrey. This is the most excitement I've had since my daddy tried to drown me. Well... that and killing my ex-girlfriend. - I got 'em! - I have a gun, too. Audrey... I'm disappointed in you. This is a rifle. I'm sorry. You have a rifle and I have a gun. Thank you. But what you don't have is the balls. - Ow! It's hot! - Let's go. Audrey! Go. - Go hide. - I'm impressed, Audrey. I misjudged you. Doesn't happen often. Forgot I was dealing with a high school valedictorian. You got guts, Audrey. And you're smart. That's a dangerous combination. You could've killed me. You don't have the kind of guts it takes to kill a man. It's something in the eyes. I sure hope shy one wasn't up in that loft. Where did you go, Audrey? Huh? Did you go off into those woods? I'm gonna bury you with this shovel, Audrey. Baby, let's go. Let's go. Wait a minute. I remember this. This is the reservoir. Okay. - What happened to it? - I don't know. The creek... it's off to the right up here. Come on. Let's go. I'm tired of fucking around. Please, you're not really going to let him kill that woman and her little girl. Yeah, well, you're next if it makes you feel any better. I wonder if it's too late to file with the Water Resources department. Girl's probably going to grow up to be a nobody anyway. Especially in this town. Come on. Hey. Hey, how late are you guys open? Okay, and how long does it take to... process the transfer of water rights? All right, so I couldn't do it if I went in today. If I went in first thing in the morning, could I do it by end of the day and get it in my company's name? I could by the end of the day? All right, I'll do that. Uh, I'll be there at 9:00 a.m. What's your name? Karen. Karen, thank you for the help. I will... I'll see you then. Where the fuck are you going? Are you trying to make a break for it? I should have shot you right when I saw you. - Get up. - Burn in hell! Fuck! God damn it! So, we have to cross it? I don't think we have a choice. Okay. Let's just be very careful. I'm scared. I know you are. We'll be across before you know it. Okay. A creek. - Mommy... - It's okay. I got you, baby. Okay. Climb. Good girl. Good girl. Take my hand. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mommy! Come up! Mom! - Are you okay? - I am. That's right. That's right. - Let's go. - What do we have here? This is a regular reunion. I would appreciate it if you would stop pointing that gun in my daughter's face. Audrey, how many times do I have to tell you that this is a rifle? Cheyenne, it's not hot now. What are you two talking about? - Push it up. - When? Now. Watch out... What are you gonna do? There has to be two shots. Let's go. Yeah. Hey. Hey, Grandpa. It's Bobby. Yeah? I was sleeping. I know, but this is important. Really? I did it. I got the water rights. Bullshit. I don't believe it. No, I promise I did it. The old man died. He died? He died and you didn't tell me? Jesus Christ. I... I would've sent flowers, or might've even gone. You gotta tell me this stuff, Bobby. I got his granddaughter to sign. Which one? Who cares? Who cares? There's two, Bobby, and they're not twins. So which one? Audrey. Audrey... Yeah, Audrey was the little one. Audrey's the one that always used to monkey around with my beard. Who care... who cares? I got 'em done. Got it signed. You didn't hurt her, did you, Bobby? No. Of course not. I'd be extremely unhappy if you hurt her. Or anything happened to her. Audrey's fine. She better be. Fuck Audrey. I get it. I did it. What did you just say? Make no mistake about who's about to tell you this. You don't ever speak to me like that. Got it? I'm sorry. I did... I didn't mean it. I just meant that I... I... I'm excited to tell you. This is great news. We get the water rights transferred tomorrow. Well, I think you'd better understand one thing. You're the first in line, and if you screw this up, you're done here. I didn't screw it up. Got it done. Rainy, we got to get out of here. Clean it up. We got to get out of here before dark. Ah... Hang up the phone. What's going on, Bobby? Nothing. I gotta call you back. Bobby, what's going on? I'll call you back. No one told you to put it in the satchel. Did you want to make a call? I'll give you my phone. Don't. I didn't kill anybody. I didn't kill anybody. That wasn't me. I wouldn't do that. I just wanted you to sign these papers. I never knew they'd fucking do that. I never knew. I swear to God. Do you have any idea what you've done to me and my kid, you greedy fuck?! I want you to make a choice. Very slowly, I want you to reach in there... and if you want to live... you'll take out the phone. And if you want to die... you'll take out the gun. I don't wanna die. I'll give you the phone. There's no sense in more violence. Cheyenne! Come on out, baby. It's okay. I'm here, Mommy. - I love you. - I love you, too. And so this concludes his last will and testament. The house is officially yours. I don't know if you want to live there now or not, given that all that's happened, but it's yours to deal with as you please. Any questions? I didn't hear you mention anything about the water rights. Water rights. Your grandfather got his water from the district. Grandpa had his water gravity-fed from the creek. I remember playing in the reservoir when I was a kid. Well, when you were a child maybe, but he switched to district water 20 years ago. He was too old to maintain the pipes. So, who owns the water rights? The state. The law is that... if water rights aren't exercised for five years or more, they go into forfeiture. Did Grandpa know this? I don't know. He would have been almost 80 when it went into forfeiture. A good chance that he couldn't read or understand the notices. So Grandpa couldn't have sold those water rights even if he wanted to? He could've gotten them from the state. - Anyone could. - Anyone? They were up for grabs for anyone? Yeah, anyone. Are you okay? Audrey? Are you all right? It's all right. You can sell off some of the trees to the sawmill. That should get you by. It'll be okay. All they had to do was ask.
