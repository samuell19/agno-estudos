[Music playing] JIMI: My name is Jimi, and I'm 21 years old. And there you have it, the answers to my two most frequently asked questions. Number one-- Jenny? Jimi, as in Hendrix. And number two-- How old are you? Here's what I want to say-- I'm nine. Child labor laws. Instead, I just laugh it off and say, Oh I'm actually 21. I'm 21. Maybe I look younger because I'm 5 foot 1, or because I ride a bike, and don't drive a car. Or could be that I don't wear much makeup, I don't know. Truth is I'm an old soul, and I think that counts. I love quality and authenticity. I work at a thrift store aptly named Second Chances. See, I even use grownup words like aptly. Every day I'm surrounded by all of these beautiful authentic items, and they all have a story. And this may sound silly, but I actually belive each item has a little bit of hope, that they'll get another chapter. And that we have in common.

And he doesn't know that she didn't actually cheat on him, it was just some guy friend that he saw her with. So we need to find him and give this to him so they can get back together. Why didn't she give it to him, or tell him? Why can't people just communicate? Well, I can save you the time. Her name is Liz Brewer. And her ex, who also sold us some of that stuff right over there, is Steve Wade. [door bell rings] Hey guys, can I help you find anything? No, we're just looking around. She hated to keep that bag, he gave it to her. Well, she should have it back, and they should be together. I mean, simple solution, communicate. [door bell rings] Oh, Aiden.

I mean, they're already a match, if they just communicated then they'd still be together. Maybe they just need a little nudge. You know my favorite episode? Season 4, episode 6. Thank you.

Well, with that girl, you have to communicate. I just, I never really know what to say to her. Like, just got so much stuff going on in my life it feels like it's kind of all over the road. Sometimes saying nothing is Okay, you just have to communicate with your actions. I mean, Jimi listens to what people say, but she believes what they actually do. You should market yourself. Got it. It isn't always what you say, sometimes it's what you do. [door bell rings] [music playing] So what's with the leg? Oh, uh, I, I just had a mishap on my bike.

Well, I'm going to skedaddle, but let me know if you hear from Aiden, all right? Oh hey, maybe, maybe that hot blonde that picked him up the other day knows where he is. Wait, what? What hot blonde? Yeah, she drove up the other day, he ran to the street corner and hopped in, hopped in her car with her. I mean, she's not like you're kind of hot, she's hot like um-- She, she works it.

Can I help you find anything? Bags maybe. Well, I actually brought one in a few months ago, but I don't see it. Are you looking for that bag in particular or something different? I kind of liked that one, and I've been missing it lately. Well, we might have sold it. That bag needed a second chance after my luck. Something new might be fun. Is it for a special occasion? Possibly. Hey girl. Oh, it's so good to see you. Oh, likewise. Hey, that bag that I brought in. Oh gosh, a lovely young lady took that a few weeks ago. Seemed like the perfect fit for her. So, are things getting better? I've been on a dating app. Eno signed me up. Well, I never pegged you for the online dating type. Me neither. I've met a few interesting guys on there. The app won't let you see their profile picture until you chat first. Any front runner? I think so. I could use some new in my life. Oh, well, like I always say, with a fresh set of eyes, all of it can become new. True, very true. I'm not feeling any of these bags. Oh, check back in a day or two. Oh I will, I love this place. It was really good to see you Junie Mae. You too Liz. [laughs] [door bell rings] [sorrowful music playing] There are some people who can't live alone. They crave that human connection. Our mom was that way. Aiden and I are both that way. And she taught us about that human connection. Someone told me recently that it's not what you say, but it's what you do that counts. Our mom lived her life that way. All of us were better for it. She loved us, she loved all of you. I'm at your house. It's me again-- Hey, are you Liz? No, I'm, I'm not. Well, hi, I'm not Will. You don't look anything like your pictures. Just two? Two, yes. Please. It's Okay. [music playing] JIMI: Thank you for calling me, I--today's just-- I have no idea what's going on. Well, it appears you and I are fired, and that your internship has been revoked. What happened? She gives most of her profits to a women's shelter to help them keep the doors open because of what she went through. Oh my God. More heart than business sense. But they can't just put a vape shop in there, that's just-- The bank has it tentatively sold to some people from the college, rich kids, daddy's money. I'm sure it'll be closed again in a couple of months. It's those two basic dudes, with a camera. So what's going to happen to our stuff? It says we only have a week to get it out. Got a van coming, going to get us some storage spaces. We can't just let this happen. It's a lot harder on Junie Mae. So where even is she? She left the day before they came, she just couldn't stand to watch them lock the doors. She's gone to see her family in Fort Smith. So everyone's just disappearing. Did you ever find Aiden? He'll be back, and Junie Mae will too. [music playing] Oh my God. Boomer, when did you do all this? We have been working on it a little bit every day since I started. So how's it going? Well, we've got sales from Facebook, from the Twitter, from YouTube, and the Gram. And it deposits in our account in two days. I can't believe it. And it covers some of the cash that we've been short on our deposits. Is it enough to stop foreclosure. We're $8,000 behind at the bank, and this will get us halfway there. And our projections will show them that we're capable of catching up. What do you mean that we're short on cash on our deposits? Everything hasn't added up between our sales and our deposits in the last few weeks. I'm sure it's Junie Mae's accounting system. I have a meeting at the bank tomorrow, and this should get our store back. You are a marketing genius. Finally. Thank you. No promises. Can we call Junie Mae? See how it goes at the bank, then we'll call her. Agreed. [upbeat music playing] Mr. Anderson is ready for you now. Okay. Just follow me up these stairs. [music playing] He's just inside the door. Thank you. Boomer, how the hell are you? You'll see. What you got for me today? Actually some good news. Anything I can get you gentlemen? No, we're fine, thank you. Alrighty. We've been doing a little online sales, and the numbers look pretty good. That amount deposits in the bank tonight which will get us about halfway there. And our projections for the fourth quarter show us catching up, and even a little bit ahead. All we need is to get the lease back in Junie Mae's name, and get these payments caught up. [sorrowful music playing] Well, I don't think we can help you on this one at this point Boomer. Our projections are made on the last 60 days of selling. And we have Black Friday and Cyber Monday next month, and that should put us over the top. It just doesn't work that simple. What do you mean? You see, the new owners, big contributors here, on the Board of Regents at the school, you understand. Oh. They want to do this for their kids. Get them in business for themselves, give them an opportunity to learn something, you've probably seen them around, they've been in, take a few pictures. Well, we'll be hiring pretty soon. Yeah, Boomer it's just not going to happen. I mean, I could call, but I know exactly what he's going to say. Would you? Call him? It's important to a lot of people. Bill? Nate over at the bank. Yeah, I've got Boomer from second chances sitting across the table from me right now, he's got a financial proposal. No, I realize that. It's already been signed, but there are a few days to remedy. No. No. [laughs] No we don't need to do that. We'll, move forward. All right, we appreciate your business. Like I said Boomer, there's nothing I can do. Well, if you change your mind-- Hey, how'd it go? I gave it my best shot, I even knew the banker. I made a very, very reasonable presentation, and it just didn't go. You showed them like everything you showed me last night though, right? Yes I did. I laid it out all in front of him, and he just didn't get it. But we had the money. We still do, it just didn't add up to him. Okay, so what are we going to do? [music playing] Lessons of love to learn yourself.

I just had to get out of there. I just couldn't stand to see them come in and take everything away. I just wish you would have told me, about everything. Remember all of our talks about communication. Yeah, it's been hard. So many people rely on that store. I have let so many people down. No, you haven't. You've, you've been there for so many people for so many years, including me. You're my best friend. I pray every night that there would be some way. [Coughs] So how are you? [Laughs] Any Aiden updates? I don't know what's going on honestly. I have no idea. But um, my dad rode into town this week and surprised me. He said if I'm just spinning my wheels, I might as well make it count. So he invited me to go on the road with him and mom. He says it might help to see new places and faces. Oh, oh no. No, no, you are not leaving me here. No, either you stay or he's going to need a sidecar. [laughs] What will I do without you? What you always do, be incredible. Well, get dressed, we're going out tonight. Okay. I'm going to go home and get ready, and you'll swing by and pick me up at 7:00 PM. And wear something vintage. [hip hop music playing] I'm always over drunk. Nice party. Well, look who it is. Hey guys, I'm going to go get a drink. So glad they're reopening. Yeah, I was literally lost when I heard they were closing. So um, what have you been up to? Work, you know, not much else. You? You know me, I'm always full tilt. TV, plate of spaghetti, sweatpants. I haven't been able to master spaghetti, but I got the sweat pants-TV thing down real good How's your girl? I love her. What in God's name? [hip hop music playing] [door bell rings] My dear old friend. I don't even know what to ask first. We found a way for us to get our store back and all of this. Found us a new investor.
