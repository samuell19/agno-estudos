THE BANDIT Based on a short story by Alexandre Dumas The events took place at the beginning of the 19th century. The location is the Moroccan Desert ... A small caravan was moving slowly on its way. This journey should heal you of romantic notions ... of the Moroccan Desert, my dear. Nothing can do that! Remember, I was in love with the desert ... Long before I became the wife of the Ambassador. Bandiþi! Bandiþi, Your Excellency! Get off! Take all the luggage off your camels and open it! Some riders are approaching! It's the Sultan's cavalry! The Sultan's cavalry? Quick! Come on, let's go! After them! Cut them off! Don't let anyone escape! Captain Carlos Delargo, the Sultan's guard. At your disposal! Your Sultan must hear about this outrage! Thousands of apologies! We've been hunting these bandits for two days. Unfortunately, they found your caravan before we found them. Undoubtedly! I am Don Felipe Castro, Ambassador of Mandorr. I'm traveling to the Sultan's camp with my wife, Donna Dolores. I will leave a guard here to escort you, Excellency ... While we finish our problems with the bandits. I hope your Excellency has not thought of too bad things in terms of our hospitality ... After the unfortunate reception, this afternoon? As Ambassador, Your Majesty ... I learned not to judge a country by its bandits. I found this attack very exciting. My wife spent many years in Tangier, Your Majesty. Find everything related to the desert, exciting. If His Majesty wants to excuse me ... I'd like to change for dinner. The young officer who saved us ... Has he served His Majesty for a long time? Not too much, but he did very well! Captain Delargo's family comes from your country. But you probably already know this story. The story of Delargo's father, the lieutenant of the guard ... And who kidnapped the King's sister ... It belongs to the pagans of the history of Mandorra and we are trying to forget, Your Majesty. Their exile proved to be Morocco's greatest gain. Young Delargo is one of the most skilful and courageous Officers. Has Captain Delargo ever been stationed in Tangier? Give it a year or two ago. Why do you ask me? Captain Delargo, Majesty! Abdul Ben Mustapha and his bandits are dead, Your Majesty. They refused to surrender, choosing to fight to the end. Slãvit fie Allah. You did well, Carlos! Maybe you'll join us for dinner? Since you already know my guests. By any means, Captain! I would like to know our savior better. If His Majesty accepts my apologies ... I have some reports to write. As you wish, Carlos. Excellency, I have received a lot of news from your country in the last month. Was there enough rain this season? I could say that they were within normal limits. Carlos... You know, the Ambassador's wife should know better ... That it is not advisable to enter a Captain's room ... Without the appropriate diplomatic formalities ! At least-without the tenth salute of a firearm. I'd rather do it without formalities, Carlos. Since no one is following us now. Then I hope you don't mind if I get dressed. Have you been in the desert for so long that you are afraid of a woman? Let's just say especially if the woman is married. The marriage only changed my name. I admit that your appearance did not suffer at all. The same beautiful girl ... The big eyes ... Loaded weapons that should not be dropped! You know the only reason I'm here! It's my only chance to see you again. I tried to get you out of my mind. To forget the feeling of your arms embracing me ... You know Dolores, this is not a good way to try to look at me ... You never disappoint me, Dolores. Your past, it seems, always catches you in pleasant company. At least I find this much more fun ... Than to sit with you and see your endless jealousy! As for you, Delargo ... I was curious to see if ... Royal blood passes through the hard mixture. Yes, there is a certain family resemblance to our King Lorenzo. Almost the same, of course, as a counterfeit coin. I appreciate your sense of humor, Excellency. But the Sultan does not like his guests to be late for dinner. The sense of etiquette of your remark came a little too late, Captain. And since this lady prefers your company ... You should receive this coin. It's the usual payment for indiscretion! The bandits in your desert should learn from you, Captain. I'm just robbing caravans. Thanks for the compliment! But a bandit is smart enough to know that a sword is much sharper than a few words. I don't need advice from the son of a bastard! Kill him, Carlos! You've already chosen your weapon, Don Castro! Carlos?! THE ROYAL PALACE OF LORENZO III, KING OF MANDORRA ... I'm sorry, Excellency! His Majesty, he is busy ... And he doesn't want to be bothered. I can hear he's busy! Well done, Lorenzo! The king was born a dancer! On the contrary, Flora! I was born King ... Dancing is a recent occupation. Majesty! Well, Triano! Not now! Can't you see how busy I am? You know there are a few heavier dances - than "Varia"? You won't find that in your portfolio , Triano! This is not a dance! It's diplomacy! Interesting... But, unfortunately, this interruption is very necessary. If the Countess can excuse us ... There are certain documents that ... Of course, Excellency! How to be ready, to dance "Varia", in the evening ... When you interrupt me insistently with your documents !? - As your Prime Minister, sir ... - I know! ...Tiu ... You write me all the documents, Triano. But you would double your value if you signed them for me. Unfortunately, that is not part of my duties, Your Majesty. In addition, the fact that I came here cannot be resolved with a signature. Well ... now what? The prisoner, Carlos Delargo ... I'm afraid it was a big mistake ... To be extradited for trial here in Mandorra. Since Delargo killed our Ambassador ... I had no other alternative! Are you suggesting we should have left him in Morocco? If we had done it, Sire, Prince Ramon ... He would immediately start spreading rumors that Castro's killer ... He would escape unpunished. Yes, my ambitious Royal cousin would not have missed this chance! But he won't have it! Since Delargo, he will be tried! His Majesty, I hope he realizes that this is impossible ... When he sees Delargo himself. I have no intention of seeing him! I heard you, Sire! Unless His Majesty is prepared to suffer shame ... To see him at the prison doctor himself . I had Delargo secretly brought to the Palace. With your permission, Sire. Bring the prisoner inside, Captain Ruiz! Some similarities were observed after Delargo was taken to prison. Some of them thought they saw your Majesty. I'm flattered! The resemblance is neither my choice nor my liking. A man with a soul! A real-Delargo! A name that should disturb your Majesty's conscience. My father's royal blood was under pressure when he heard the name Delargo! It's confidential ... I rather admire the soldier who was brave enough ... To kidnap the Princess! As for me, I never considered that my parents' marriage ... It was a criminal offense. It would be a great pity to see the result of such an idyll ... That it hung at the end of a rope. Then you agree, Sire, it would be a disgrace ... As a man who closely resembles you, be tried for murder. It's inconceivable! But ... what do you suggest, Triano? We should make some concessions and consider ... This letter from the Sultan of Morocco. He asks for Delargo's clemency. With Napoleon's shadow approaching our borders ... It would be a wise decision to have the Sultan's friendship. I can assure you, Your Majesty, that you will be the Sultan's friend ... It's much better than being his enemy. Did you hear that, Triano? It seems that Delargo has a talent for diplomacy! Take him back to prison, and get ready for trial! - But, Your Majesty, he just said ... - But ... We cannot judge an escaped detainee. Especially one that will arrive, let's say ... In Portugal. Ruiz, get everything ready! I hope we have some time to get to know each other better, Delargo. Your life must be much more interesting than mine. I am grateful to your Majesty for extending it to me! That's how it should be! I understand that women in Portugal are extraordinary! Thank you for this opportunity to verify these rumors. I should inform your cousin Regal Ramon ... That his friend Castro's killer will be tried in a week. Now, let's get back to more important things ! Wine, Flora! My dance! I want history to remind you of this extraordinary occupation. Maybe you will become known as Lorenzo the Great! Aim a little higher, Prince Ramon. Napoleon's ambassador should admire a bold target. Bullseye! See, there's no reason to be alarmed! Please forgive me if I remain realistic in the face of the facts. Unpleasant facts, that a new alliance ... Which Triano arranged with your cousin Regal ... And with the Princess of Caruna. You can inform your Emperor ... That the marriage between Lorenzo and the Princess will never take place. Your Highness, is he serious? Did you hear that there will be a Royal hunt tomorrow morning ? Of course. But please forgive me, I have no interest in outdoor sports. Well, you should, sir. Isn't that right, Major? Since the French Ambassador will not participate in the hunt tomorrow ... Maybe we should give him a demonstration of one of the weapons now! It's a very good idea! Judging by his coat of arms, this is His Majesty 's weapon. That's not an exact copy. Rod and weapon him Lorenzo. It seems so. But I don't understand ... What does a weapon have to do with preventing our dangerous alliance? You'll know in a moment. Major ... Get out of the way, gentlemen! Now, let's imagine that Lorenzo ... He's aiming for the pheasant tomorrow morning. So, gentlemen ... His alliance with Caruna can be destroyed by a single shot. Wonderful! Have you ever seen anything like it, Carnot? I once heard of a similar weapon that was used in Spain. It was the most successful assassination. Please, Carnot! No murder! Let's call it the "Pre-Arranged Accident." And Mandorra's throne will be empty ... For our good friend. - Get rid of this, Major! - Yes, Your Highness. Now, let's make sure the Royal servants find our loaded weapon ... They will wait for him to hand it to Lorenzo. I can tell you, congratulations from my Emperor ... The new King? I hope you can promise me Napoleon's support too? You already have it, Your Majesty! "Your Majesty"? I like how that sounds! Majesty ... Veniþi! We need to get ready for the hunting dinner tonight. It would be a great sin ... Let's be late for Lorenzo's last dinner. Yes ... Come on! Since our dinner honors the hunting spirit ... The hunter's skills should not be eaten until tested. Your arrows against this Royal bird! Not a single target wants to hunt for dinner? No my dear! It would be totally devoid of sportiness to shoot a bird that is held in its hand. I find it much more appropriate for this bird to be caught ... Than to be killed! Muzicieni - "various"! The hunters' dance! Apparently, they liked our dance. Too bad my other business, intervene between our tour through the Capitals of Europe. Do you want to ... share loot, my love? First time... Contention Flora! That's a little bit of admiration ... From the student to the teacher! Oh, and beautiful, Lorenzo! It's not beautiful enough! And now ... for ... Vãrul mine, Prinþul ... A crown? Why not? Didn't you always want to have one? For you, sir ... Since Napoleon, it 's so far from our artillery ... His ambassador should appreciate, a plus ... Mic. His Majesty, he is too kind! As you can see it's not pointing in my direction. As a diplomat, I prefer treaties over cannons. Distribute it to other guests. Triano is coming ... No portfolio! Triano! Don't tell me you left the office for dinner? I apologize for interrupting your hunting dinner. Then maybe the Prime Minister wants to join us? Unfortunately, that pleasure is forbidden to me ... Of no urgent problem. Who asks me to see His Majesty at once, in private! Tomorrow, for business, tonight for ... Pleasure! This problem can't wait, Sire! Then say it here. You know, it's useless to keep secrets from my friends ... And to Napoleon's ears. Princess Teresa of Caruna will arrive here the day after tomorrow ... So I thought, Your Majesty, he won't waste his time ... He will announce when the wedding ceremony will take place . Let her know what day she wants . Can I express my congratulations? Congratulations to Triano, I'm only getting married out of political necessity. You know, I'm surprised he agreed. Alteþa sa Regalã, eo Prinþesã ... Ready to serve the best interests of her country. Let's worship! Since we, those present here, are more interested in pheasants ... Than the Princesses ... I drink in honor of the hunter! May the hunt be successful, as well as the alliance organized by Triano! It is very dangerous to leave my party , my love! Don't you realize that I can get you shot for desertion? I had ... a headache! Is this some headache because you heard about the Princess? Lorenzo! You always knew how to guess my thoughts! This time they are full of nonsense. Besides... You have my heart! Can I be sure of that, Lorenzo? You will be, when you see that it is inscribed with only two words ... "Always has." This means? "Always yours" ... Always has ... I like these words ... Beautiful plain, for a hard hunt , friends! Are you betting today, Ramon? With a gold coin for the first bird? Your Majesty, you will lose this bet. It's too high. I'll waste a bullet. Here's another one, Lorenzo! You should do this, Ramon! It's right above you! You must be nervous today, cousin. I've never seen you miss a target so close before. It seems that my vision needs adjustments. You better take my gun. My servant will bring me another. No, thank you! I will try mine again. It could cost you to lose your bet! Carry, Lorenzo! Isn't the king with your Highness? Not. No, I saw him in the last few minutes. - Maybe he shot a bird. - I heard a shot. Yes, I heard it too. His Majesty has lost a lot of blood. No wonder, according to the size of the shot! Your Excellency, did you see anything unusual about the weapon? He had a defect. He had water in the barrel, and Prince Ramon was his hunting companion. This was not an accident! Dr. Lopez, does your Majesty live? I think the King's life is safe. However, he may remain unconscious for several hours. Full recovery may take several weeks. Weeks? The princess of Caruna will arrive tomorrow. You said that no one noticed, how did you find the King? I did not give anyone this chance, Excellency. Very wise of you. No one needs to know about His Majesty's condition . If anyone finds out that Lorenzo isn't able to drive ... Prince Ramon will have the right to do his duties as King. - Excellent ... - What happened? Prince Ramon and the French Ambassador are in the office. I ask the audience, His Majesty. "The eagles gathered quickly." - What will you do, Excellency? I'll keep them as long as I can. Can I be of any help to you, gentlemen? His Majesty, he omitted, to pay me a small bet. Since he disappeared so suddenly this afternoon. The king suffered a small hunting accident . Accident? I didn't know ... I have to go to him! Your Highness, I'm afraid that's impossible. Dr. Lopez gave him a sedative, He insisted that His Majesty rest. What tragic news for you, my friend! Since the Princess will arrive tomorrow. And maybe he needs my help, as heir to the throne? Of course, if his "accident" is not serious. How serious is it, buddy? I'm not a doctor, Mr. DeLaforce ... But I have some knowledge of firearms. Don't you think it's unusual for a weapon to shoot back? Maybe it was loaded incorrectly ... May be... Or maybe an assassination attempt was intentionally planned. But is that ridiculous ?! Maybe your Highness would like to examine the weapon a little? I would like to know the opinion of a hunting expert. "I don't see anything wrong with her." - Are you sure about that? - I'm putting my life at stake for this! - Really? Since the other barrel is so loaded ... Why don't you pull out the window, Your Highness? This will prove that my suspicions are unfounded. Of course... Triano, as heir to the throne ... Do you think I should take a personal risk? I'm sure Your Highness knows what's best for him. I will wait for a report from you, hour by hour ... About His Majesty's condition. If there are signs that his condition is getting worse ... Well, I'll be ready to take His Majesty's place right away. I don't think that's going to be necessary. Of course! Dr. Lopez! His Majesty, you must come to that reception! Or Ramon, it will break our alliance before it is made! But it's impossible! Your Excellency, I think he's crazy? If I'm crazy, this will be my last effort to save this country! - And Carlos Delargo? - Delargo? He left in the carriage three hours ago . Take the fastest horse in the stable, Captain, and bring Delargo back! "I'm afraid it's too late." - You have to catch up! Port of Spain 20 km. The king is still unconscious. Haven't received any news from Ruiz yet? If Delargo arrives in the Port of Spain, Ruiz will never find him again. Excellency, from the latest reports ... I found out that the carriage of the Princess of the Princess from Caruna was 8 km from the Palace. The princess arrives a few hours earlier than expected. Isabela, put down that English short story ... Before you destroy your eyes. Oh, dar Alteþa Regalã... He was about to kiss her! One hundred pages ... Doesn't seem so impatient ... I'm sure, King Lorenzo, maybe better than that. Oh yes! Even in the painting, His Majesty ... You can see the fiery eyes of a great lover! According to rumors, his eyes are burning in one direction only. Of course, Your Highness, don't think ... In such rumors? On the contrary, Isabela. It is said that it is very beautiful. Let me introduce you to the King's cousin - Prince Ramon! Welcome to Mandorra, Your Highness! It is a great pity that the joy of your arrival here is overshadowed by this bad news. Veºti rele ?! His Majesty suffered an unfortunate hunting accident. I hope it's not serious? I don't think he'll be able to be at your reception tonight. I want to assure the Princess that the reception will still be held. I am ready to lead in the King's place. Your Highness! Port of Spain 5 km Hold my horse! "I'm sorry, friend Delargo!" - Ruiz? Your passport has been canceled. You're coming back with me! Should I go back? But the Captain himself heard how His Majesty gave me a mission ... Very important - to study women in Portugal. I'm afraid the women of Lisbon will have to do without you. Just for a few days. Back to the Palace, visit! You know, this is the shortest trip I've ever heard of, to Portugal. I'm worried I haven't heard anything about the King's condition. Maybe that's a sign of hope, that he may still be able to appear, Your Highness. I hope you don't be too disappointed. Assuming the King's duties will certainly include ... Make your visit here as enjoyable as possible. Now-hair! To look exactly the same ... - Trabuc? - Thank you! No, Carlos! His Majesty never thanks anyone. His Majesty never lights his cigar alone! I can't remember! It's useless! I want to do it. But this is crazy, Triano! "I will never be able to do it!" - She's right, Excellency. It took Lorenzo 30 years to become himself. How can Carlos do it in 30 minutes ?! He will do it, because he has to! Ramon has already taken on the duties of King. If he prevented the alliance with Karuna ... Napoleon's legions would conquer us in a week! These are the habits of a King. It takes a long time for people to get used to them, remember? How will this be possible? Just resist this night and tomorrow's wedding. Yes, but the Princess certainly won't be fooled for too long! His Highness never saw His Majesty. And I will be with you, to ask you together with the others. His Excellency, you may need a ventricle! You have a debt to the King. Or have you already forgotten her? I have to admit, your arguments are getting better today, Triano ... I have to warn you! As of now ... The King's heart is completely occupied by Countess Flora. Who danced to win the King's affection in the taverns of Barcelona. How blind a man can be! Her Majesty has never been blind to beauty. I would say that I would be much safer among the bandits from Morocco ... Except before this Court. Well... - Let's hope I'm lucky. - If you're not ... You will have plenty of company on the gallows. Oh, the bandage! His Majesty, the King! Ramon, he looks like he sees a ghost. Aºa e. It certainly can't work! It's not carried on a stretcher! Your Majesty, it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to ... Princess Teresa! Pleasure and honor are on my side! I am glad to see that Your Majesty's wounds were not serious! I would have come out of the grave, to welcome you, Your Highness! I started to think no, I have to, cousin ... Judging by ... Discretion of your health. I didn't mean to alarm you more than necessary, Ramon. I suspected you had a more dishonorable reason ... And that you are trying to avoid paying the bet. Bet payment? My apologies, Sire! His Majesty has given me clear instructions This morning, I 'll give you the gold coin. My memory ... played tricks on me. Your Highness! Please sit down! Princess, wait for your Majesty to sit down. Oh, for the Princess, I will begin the ceremony! I hope His Majesty's wounds don't hurt her? The pain immediately left me at the sight of Your Highness. Ah, d-null DeLaforce! Didn't you tell him that the King doesn't get up when he receives someone? I can't think of everything! Let me express my compliments from Napoleon, Sire. I assure you, I prefer Napoleon 's compliments to ... Condoleanþele him. Let me express my great happiness ... On the recovery, so fast of, Your Majesty! Your concern is very touching, my dear Flora! I think you'll make your wounds worse if you keep moving, Sire. Sit down! Majesty ... I received an unexpected visit from the Sultan of Morocco. The Sultan ?! His Majesty, the Sultan of Morocco! Sire... He must come to you. We are honored to welcome you, Your Majesty, to Mandorra! It's a great pleasure to see you again, Lorenzo! Triano... But ... Your arm, Sire? I was shot by mistake, being mistaken for a pheasant. And what brings His Majesty to Mandorra this time? A sudden decision to go to Spain. And talk to you about a certain prisoner ... Whose resemblance to that of your Majesty always amazes me. Oh yes! Prisoner Delargo! If His Majesty wants to excuse me ... Prinþesã, Sire! This visit of your Majesty, gives you the opportunity to meet her, ... My future Queen. Ladies and gentlemen, let's have a drink in honor of the King! In honor of His Highness! Princess Teresa, whose beauty ... It will become the new precious jewel of the crown of Mandorra! Looks like the King has found a new dance partner. Yes ... Yes, she's very beautiful, is n't she? I see that your Majesty prefers gardens to dance halls? It always seemed to me that the light of the moon was much more attractive than the light of the chandeliers. Even a King should have a few moments of solitude ... With a woman he will spend his whole life with. The king ... forget that our wedding is just a matter of state ... Arranged for the mutual security of both countries. Your waiting lady has already warned me that this sounds like you. Cum? Like a swollen Prime Minister in the Council of State. Then perhaps His Majesty made the wrong choice In choosing the companion for the walk under the moonlight. You see, I have never forgotten about my obligations to the state. It's time to do it ... On the threshold of our marriage. Could you ever forget that you are ... King? You don't know how often, I did that! You know, I came here, ready to dislike you. Everything I've heard about you is different from how you really are. It's like finding another man here. I let you down? You should hear the rumors and gossip circulating in our Court. And you look more and more like one, Prime Minister. I think we'd better get inside. He is afraid that the Court will suspect that ... The king is very attracted to her, with whom he is about to marry. Certainly, the Court so far has been accustomed ... Courting a woman in the garden. But they are not aware that Lorenzo, the one in the garden, tonight ... It's like you said ... A different man. So different that ... Will this romantic story come to an end? All but one ... Which has just begun. I'm telling you the truth, Teresa, when I tell you that ... I've never felt what I feel now. These are touching words, Lorenzo ... But I have little experience in judging the honesty of such words. That the Princess ... Surely you should never doubt the words of a King. Speak now, as King ... Or like a man. The king was safely moved to the old arsenal. Dr. Lopez said there was no change in his condition. Ah, Triano! We consulted with the stars! I need to consult with, Your Majesty. Forgive us, but ... there were so many stars ... Can I talk to you in private, Your Majesty? His Highness promises me that he will not disappear ... That Cinderella at midnight? If I do, I'll lose a shoe, Your Majesty. You look very happy, Your Highness. Well, Triano, I hope I played my part well. To well. You overestimated yourself. And the walk through the garden was totally different from Lorenzo's character. That could upset us all. She is the girl Lorenzo will marry. She can't fall in love with another man, Carlos! Do you expect me to feel nothing for a girl like her ?! I expect you to remember that you are Lorenzo ... And consider that tomorrow 's marriage is only for a political alliance. But the Princess will prefer something else. Boy ... You will hurt her much more if you let her fall in love with you ... Rather than marry Lorenzo. Gives... I'm sorry I got out of the role. It will not happen again. Having you as your dance partner ... Every man could be equal to a King. Without a doubt, cousin. My dear Flora, I'm sorry I neglected you. Oh, but I understood perfectly. Her Majesty's attention was absorbed by ... His obligations to the state. My obligations did not destroy all my pleasures, my love! And the first thing I'm going to do is dance with you. His Excellency, I would like to convey my apologies to the King. I had a long journey. - I have to retire! "Of course, Your Highness!" - Are you tired? - Of course not. The King's accident doesn't seem to have much effect on his dancing skills. A hole in his chest seems to make him move, better. - Delargo ... - Here? Nothing... Oh, my Countess! Finally, our patience is richly rewarded! We began to fear that his admiration, His Majesty ... It could be late all night. - Contention! - Alteþã! Looks like the King was in a great mood tonight. But I guess you didn't invite me here to talk about Lorenzo. On the contrary, my dear! That's why I invited you! I know how deeply you are attached to His Majesty. My devotion to Lorenzo was never a secret. Then maybe we can get rid of your worries As for the Princess ... If the man you saw isn't Lorenzo. Definitely not serious! Tonight, my dear, you danced with a man who looks exactly like Lorenzo. Which we are convinced is the Delargo prisoner ... Which is supposed to have escaped from his cell yesterday. I do not believe this! I found out that Delargo couldn't get out of the cell ... Because he was never in it. His appearance was a perfect chain of coincidences ... Set up by Triano, to save the marriage ... When Lorenzo 's hunting accident prevented him from appearing. And then what happened to the King? Where is it? We'll only be able to find out when we know for sure that Delargo has taken his place. Maybe then he will lead us to the King. And ... who better to find out ... Than a woman who loves the King! Gives... He left his guests too long to wait, Lorenzo. Some of my friends have very long names, my dear. But I'd rather tell you, good night, after all. Make sure you are present in my dreams. I feel like someone else is taking my place. Impossible! A mind is a mirror that reflects a single girl. Princess Teresa has a very beautiful daughter . Even? I barely noticed that. Are you sure, Lorenzo? If you didn't know that you are as wise as you are beautiful ... I would have said you were jealous. And shouldn't I be? Of course not! We'll get rid of that thought now ... By Royal Decree! Are you, Lorenzo, mine? Don't doubt it! When the marriage ends, we will go on a vacation. Ramon was wrong. Ramon, he's always wrong. Why? He suspects you are in fact - the Delargo prisoner ... And that you pretend to be the King. What an amazing idea ?! Gives! Poor Ramon! It seems that his ambitions made him lose his mind! But I'm sure you ... could never be fooled! Of course not! I could never doubt you ... With the inscription you put on my pendant. Oh! But you haven't written it yet! Well, I ... I had no time. I'll write it down tomorrow morning. Tell me Lorenzo, what will you write there? - The words? - Yes! Didn't I tell you? Did you tell me? What else could I say but ... "Here's my love" !? These are not the words Lorenzo would have inscribed on my pendant! Please don't lie to me anymore! I know you're an impostor! Tell me where Lorenzo is? I need to know! I'm sorry, I can't answer that. Can't or don't you want to? Or was he seriously injured in the hunting accident ?! Gives! But the accident was an assassination attempt ... Set up by Prince Ramon. But, His Majesty? Is it safe? All I know is that there is still hope that he will recover. Where it is or how it is - it's not my job to tell you that. I believe you. I believe you because you put yourself at risk ... For Lorenzo's protection. Ramon suspects you. Be careful! Be very careful! Flora... Gives? I think His Majesty would love it if you kept it. Even without registration. Thanks! Are you sure about that, Flora? Is this man Lorenzo? - Exactly! - We were wrong, sir. Thank you, my dear! Oh, Flora! Frog, from the accident ... Can you tell if she was serious? As you can see, judging by him tonight - it wasn't. I'm very relieved! Was the shot between the shoulder above the elbow? Shoulder just above the elbow. I am very grateful to you! "Good night, Your Highness!" - Good night, Flora! D-nule ... - The mind, of course ... - Of course! What can you expect ... when a woman is in love? Who is? Open in the name of pleasure! You ... um ... You caught me without boots, cousin! I'll let you in in a moment. I'm sorry to bother you so late! But it's all your fault, cousin! You are so popular with the ladies! In fact, only one. I'm glad you didn't stay longer. Everyone is waiting for us! Bachelor's dinner! It has been planned for many weeks! Oh, yes ... yes! Did the wine at the reception blur your mind? Just patience. It's ... enough for me to drink all night. Surely not for your last night of freedom? All the officers of your regiment are waiting for you to lead them to the detonation. Isn't that right, Major? Lead them ... lead them in my place. I need to meet again with, Triano. Let's make arrangements for tomorrow's wedding. "Nobleþea bond", ºtii art. Your Majesty will see Triano at dinner. He went there before, with Ruiz. Didn't he tell me anything about it? Well, he knows your Majesty too well to ... To remind you of the pleasures of pleasure. Come on! I'd rather ... I'll follow you there later. Where ... Where is it kept, Ramon? In the fan room, of course. Where we always hunt in the evening. It would be much wiser on your part to accompany me. In the interest of your own safety, of course. Your arguments are very impressive, sir. Major! His mantle, His Majesty! Really! You have certainly chosen the most suitable place for suffering, cousin! At least ... The people here will not be disturbed, Your Majesty. These gentlemen - are they ghosts or guests? They are my guests ... Get him! Take him to the crypt! These promises will put you in the most comfortable position. I hope my wedding ceremony won't last too long? We'll shorten it as much as we can, Sire ... If you answer us quickly, some questions. Where is the King? I am the King, you fool! Then you should feel at home, here ... Among your Royal ancestors. Your wound healed very quickly ... Majesty! Then I think you heard, cousin ... That my strength of recovery is legendary. Where is the King? You're the master of this party, you should know that! Your Royal appearance will be elegantly changed, my friend ... If you continue with this prank! Where is the King? Maybe if you let go of my hands, I could draw you a map. Atenþie, Schrock! If he becomes unconscious, he will not be able to answer my questions. When the time comes, I'll talk to my sword! Very brave, but not very wise. You must have learned by now that your wedding ceremony tomorrow will not be held ... So why are you prolonging this party? Lorenzo, is he alive or dead, Delargo? He needs more conviction. Leave it to me, Mr. Schrock! Continue with your stubbornness, my friend ... And soon you will be in the same condition as these Royal gentlemen. I find their comfort, a decisive imprudence. I'm starting to get tired. For the last time... Where is the King? Wait for the moment, to put your neck in the Royal gallows, cousin. Wake him up! He will not be able to speak for a time, Your Highness. Stay with His Majesty. Keep questioning him when he wakes up. I'm curious how Triano will handle the marriage ceremony ... No groom. She is very beautiful, Your Highness! I know how excited and proud he will be, His Majesty! So excited and proud, how was last night? I know he was a little ... distracted ... But today will be different! For a moment, in the garden, I believed everything he told me. It must have been blinded by the moonlight. Oh, please! Stand still, Your Highness, or the veil will bend. Oh, my good Ruiz! This morning, it seems , all your pain is imprinted on your face. Delargo, not dressed yet? Carlos a dispãrut, Excellency. - Isn't he in his room? - It's nowhere in the Palace. One of the guards at the gate said it could have been in a covered carriage ... With whom Prince Ramon went on a mysterious journey last night. Ramon? Is he still gone? The prince returned early this morning. How long is it? There are two hours until the start of the wedding ceremony. Find Delargo! If our King is not in the chapel, we will never be in an alliance with Caruna! Yes, Excellency ... But can I find the Royal "Needle" in just two hours ?! Search all the places you think Ramon could have taken him ... And report to me by noon! Come on, come on, Your Majesty! It's time to wake up! Untie it! He can't talk if he dies. Now, get some water. The princess will take place here ... And the King, here. We will meet, as soon as His Majesty arrives! Yes, Your Holiness. Triano! Are you nervous, my friend? Any difficulties at the moment, maybe? No ... As far as I know, Your Highness? No, I'm surprised. From now on, you may have learned that I am holding your false King. I have no idea what he's talking about, Your Highness. You know, I really admire him! He's so calm and confident ... In the face of disaster! Don't admit that it would be a great shame, now ... If your King did not appear? Please excuse me, Your Highness! There is no trace of Delargo, Excellency. Take care! He's watching over us, Captain. You have to look confident. You want me to prepare a covered, excellent carriage for you . The climate will become very unhealthy when Ramon has the rights to the throne. Go to the Princess. Tell him there's a little delay. I'll call her as soon as ... Her Highness, Princess Teresa of Caruna! Excellency ... As heir to the throne, you would not want to do ... A more appropriate ad? Or do you prefer to see how your "alliance" ... Waiting calmly in front of the altar? Does Your Highness want to take a seat on the right? And now, if His Majesty is ready ... Time is up, buddy! If you don't make the announcement, I'll do it! With your permission, Excellency! I have been informed that, some unforeseen events, he will delay His Majesty. So we will have to postpone this wedding ceremony ... Until a more opportune time. I understand, Excellency! Let's go back to our room , Isabella! I hope I'm not too late, Excellency? Well, cousin! I see, you managed to avoid, ... The tiring journey from the bachelor party? We are both resistant to drinking. Iertaþi-code, Alteþã! I almost fell victim to my bachelor party. I am glad to see that your Majesty has survived! Survived !? I was wonderful! I was like a Hercules, on the battlefield, of pleasure! Swimming through the sea of ​​Champagne ... Let me be with you! At least it didn't stop Your Majesty from appearing at all! Your Highness, did he somehow doubt that he would have missed the meeting with the lady? Of course not! It could have damaged your Majesty's reputation . Doubts of disapproval, already ... They showed people I betrayed them. Let's not let them wait. I'm making a good pair. Don't you think, Prince? You will leave that ... Impostor, to take an oath in Lorenzo's name? It looks pretty authentic to me. Your Highness, can you prove that it is not so? Please kneel and join your hands. Oh, Almighty God! Lorenzo, King of the Mandorrei ... He's here to marry her ... Teresa, Princess of Caruna. In front of Our Father and this assembly ... I pledge to unite through the holy ceremony of marriage ... During this month. May the Holy Spirit help them, live together ... In purity and in love ... During the days that will pass, until the end of their union ... And until the end of their lives! - Amen! - Amen! Open the gate! Flora! Oh, Lorenzo! Dear! I was so worried! You also had reasons to be! But, apparently, I will survive. I would have come right away! If he had told me where you were. I was a state secret ... Until the day when, I could send for you. I hope you didn't make a mistake. You know, Ramon could have followed me. Maybe, but he'll find out anyway, sooner or later. When I return, I will hang him high from the clock of the tower. At least he didn't get anything, my dear. Thanks to Delargo, the marriage is assured. Gives... I owe it to our Moroccan friend . ªi he Triano. Give ... But for now ... You are more important to me than any state business! Promise me one thing ... That you will take care of Ramon! He will need the wings of a bat to fly over these walls. As a doctor at the court, you should be more concerned The health of your patient, Lopez! If you keep forcing me to hold you back ... In my work, against the King's recovery. Where is he hiding, Lorenzo? I certainly think your Highness knows about the medical oath. The guard's trust says that this is part of our profession! Oh, I thought healing patients was much more important than ... Sharing a political conspiracy. If you notice, I aimed, Paris. Mandorra, it's behind your head, Doctor. To choose as my future target ... That His Majesty could be deprived of medicine ... Definitely! The medicine, Your Highness ... It turned out to be much more fatal than mine. "Your Highness!" Excellent! - Well, Carnot? Countess Flora left tonight in a covered carriage. - She? - He left with His Majesty's secretary ... They headed for the old arsenal, four miles from here, through the woods. Look! The answer to all our questions! - Is the place well guarded? - There are no more than four people but ... But the gates are strong enough to hold an army, Your Highness. I know those gates. We will need your help, Doctor, to open them. Major, take the doctor to his carriage. Open the gates! It's Dr. Lopez. Corporal! - Search the arsenal! "Close the gates, Carnot!" Your clemency and your passport. I hope that His Majesty will not be upset that I will change my destination from ... Portugal in Morocco. That's just a small reward for the service you did us, Carlos. I'd better go tonight. - Just like I came! - Yes. That would be best. If you want to pass it on to someone, goodbye ... Da, Triano. I would be very happy. Forgive me! I thought His Majesty was alone. He was about to be alone. Please excuse me, Sire. I didn't expect to see you, Your Highness, tonight! Didn't you want that? No, Teresa ... Because I knew that if I saw you, I would have to tell you something. That the King will embrace me with both hands next time we dance? What I want to tell you has nothing to do with the King. There ... and ... Talk about another man. A stranger... Who happened to enter a house that did not belong to him. And no one knew this man? They knew him. But it was someone else. Did he allow himself to be deceived? Gives! Even the woman he fell in love with. But did she believe in him? He had no right to believe her. Because he doesn't belong to this house, and because he won't stay here. I'm afraid you underestimated this girl. You see, now, you know this stranger. This house was also occupied by the Prime Minister, who ... He knew it was hard to keep a secret. And can you forgive this stranger? Who, intelligently, stole your love? While playing the role of another? How can I forgive him, when ... When are we both guilty of the same crime? I was the most guilty. Because I always knew that, I would have to disappear from your life ... Like a shadow. And live for a few moments near the walls of your room. Please forgive me for the interruption, Princess! As I just explained, the Prime Minister ... The urgency of my problem needs immediate attention. I'm sure, gentlemen, they'll excuse me. Maybe it would be better if His Highness stayed. The news of the French Ambassador concerns us all. I have been informed that, Prince Ramon ... He holds the real King Lorenzo hostage in the arsenal. His Highness will be condemned, for high treason, to the crown! Betrayal, sir ?! That's a weird word coming from a man who ... He dared to replace the King with this impostor! I am aware of the replacement and for whom the replacement was made, Mr DeLaforce. Prince Ramon has prepared the statement ... To give up this illegal marriage. I have to force you to sign it right away. "Why should he, DeLaforce?" - To save Lorenzo's life. Not even Ramon would risk committing a crime to seize the throne. Your people will only know that the King died of his wounds ... Coming from my hunting accident . But your signature on this statement ... It will have the same effect as a formal abdication. I have no such authority! And I will not give in to this blackmail! Did you signal your man to return to the old arsenal? Of course! I wanted to make sure that your answer ... It will be sent immediately to Prince Ramon. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid your stubbornness, It will cost his life, Lorenzo. Gentlemen! "Do you want me to arrest him, Excellency?" - Not! Mr. DeLaforce, will remain here as my guest. What worries me now is Lorenzo. "Do you think he's telling the truth?" - For the first time, yes. There are no troops in Mandorra who can save the King ?! None he could trust. The secret of what I did ... It cannot be shared with anyone outside this room, Your Highness. Do you know the arsenal, Ruiz? - Just like in my shack. - Then come with me! We're wasting our time! Carlos, I hoped we wouldn't need your services again. We both made a vow of marriage ... His Highness, he will marry Lorenzo! Let's hide the horses! There's a secret escape passage here, which was used during the siege of Tazo. - Where is he going? - In the drainage channel ... Positioned between the walls. Can I do something to make you feel a little more comfortable, Lorenzo? Your Highness! The Prime Minister refused to sign. He was always a stubborn man. - Where's Lorenzo? - In the tower. That window is his room. Good! Now that I get to the tower ... Shoot some gunshots. If anyone was in Lorenzo's room, you'd get them out. Good! Good luck! I offer you a passport for life. The healthy abdicans! If you sign, you will be able to live wherever you want. Outside the Palace, of course! I was told never to sign any documents ... Which he didn't approve of, Triano. Oh, please sign, Lorenzo! I beg you! I have a certain attachment to my throne, Flora. I guess it is, out of habit. Even than the greatest satisfaction of life. You should take Flora's advice seriously , cousin. You see, we just need to open your wounds again ... And my goal will be fulfilled anyway! Maybe it will be less legal ... I will never ... Ai ales, Lorenzo. - Not! No ... - Get up! Now! Now! Idiot, what did you do ?! Lorenzo... Flora... Majesty? Who is? Carlos Delargo. Help Flora! Can that door be closed from the inside? No, Ramon closed it on the outside. He can return at any time. You thought you were fooling me to release you . Lorenzo? Lorenzo! So, Triano, did he have an ace up his sleeve? Carnot! Face the wall, Carnot! Majesty! You can leave now. The man who lived with his sword on his head ... He should learn to wait on the ribs! I thought your best weapon was ... Let's say: a firearm ... Pulling back. I like you more than you dance, cousin! Majesty! Ramon? It won't bother you now, Your Majesty. Thank you, Delargo, for ... Because you defended the crown! "The Prime Minister by order of His Majesty ... Invites you to the wedding ceremony ... Of His Majesty, the King of Mandorra ... With Her Royal Highness, Princess Teresa of Caruna ... On April 3, 1804, at noon ... La Capelã Regalã ". When Carlos found out that the tailors were preparing him for the wedding ... Instead of going to Portugal, it exploded like a grenade, Excellency. You better hide, sir. His Excellency, he is in a bad state! You will be bad! Where is Triano? I think His Excellency hid among the roses, Your Majesty. And you two, if you do not disappear immediately from me, I will make you beheaded! Yes, Majesty! Yes, Majesty! Maybe Your Highness will explain to me if: Triano or I ... Am I crazy? I am sorry! But His Excellency, he just followed my orders. That future Queen of Mandorra. Well ... sometimes even a Queen's orders don't have to be obeyed. You must realize that our country needs a King too. Your Highness may have forgotten who I am. I only know that you are the last descendant of the Royal House of Mandorra. If you don't want to take the throne ... I will have to follow you into exile ... Like another Royal Princess, who once followed your father. I think in exile it will not be as comfortable as at the Palace. Maybe... We should break Delargo's curse ... - Well, Ruiz? - I know. I will immediately bring the tailors to your Excellency.
