Our father of the nation, Gandhi walked on the path.. ..of truth and injustice, he did various protests.. ..and had thrown out Britishers from our country. But these days, using protest as a pretext.. ..any man, organization, or political party.. ..want to get their legal or illegal demands met. These days, some protests are done not for the public.. ..but for their selfishness. Many political parties have made protest as a.. ..weapon of political conspiracy. Our story is not inspired by any incident or any living being.. ..it is completely imaginary. The aim of our story is to try to awaken youth generation of today. Glory to! - Baba! Glory to! - Baba! Glory to! - Baba! Glory to! - Baba! Glory to! - Baba! No.. Lord Krishna, you are doing wrong again. Baba don't want you to praise him, but he wants you all.. ..to praise his beloved mother. Now, you all say, 'Glory to! - Baba's mother.' Glory to! - Baba's mother. Glory to! - Baba's mother. Baba, you are again going on a foreign trip? India and abroad are equal for saints like us. The earth is one. Like you all get my love and affection here.. ..I'm going to give the same love and affection.. ..to my disciples in abroad. Great thought. Great thought. Baba, you always go on foreign trips.. ..then who looks after your hermitage in your absence? Disciples.. Tillu, my beloved disciple.. ..takes care of the hermitage in my absence. Glory to! - Baba's mother. Glory to! - Baba's mother. Glory to! - Baba's mother. Glory to! - Baba's mother. Mr. Pratap, what's the matter? Didn't you go for a walk in the garden in the morning? - Look at this! You are joking? My blood pressure is increasing here. Why? - Our party can never be formed. Never. What? - The situation is going out of our hands.. ..and you are sitting idle. Minister, do something to get down this government. Think of something.. please. I have two issues to make this government fall. Corruption and inflation. - So? The issue will be ours.. ..but it will be told by Baba. - Baba? Who is this Baba? - Yes, who is this Baba? What will he do? - Protest. Baba will protest. - I understood. We need not do anything now. Glory to Baba. - Glory to him. Corruption has increased so much in our village.. ..the medicine that comes for us from the government.. ..are being sold before they are brought here. There is a hospital, but there's no doctor. All the doctors are busy in their own clinics. Other than government salary, they are earning extra income. No one is bothered if the poor villagers live or die. When the doctors are earning, why will the compounder sit quiet? They've started renting the hospital rooms to people. They've turned the hospital into a guest house. These days, hospital has become a place to have fun. But you all don't worry. I'll go and talk to the government. Glory to! - Brother Satya! Glory to! - Brother Satya! Glory to! - Brother Satya! "The land of my country yields gold and pearls." "The land of my country.." Hello? - Hello Mr. Tillu, how are you? Oh Lord, how did you remember poor people like me? Mr. Tillu, I wanted to talk to Baba. Make me talk to him. I would've made you talk to him, but Baba has gone abroad. So what? Connect a conference call. Is it? By the way, Baba has instructed me. But still, I will try. Yes Tillu? Why did you call me all of a sudden? Glory to Baba's mother! - Glory to my mother. Baba, Mr. Gopinath wants to talk to you. He has brought work for you. - I see, work. That means I'll get money. - Yes. Put him on line immediately. Hello? Mr. Gopinath, speak up. Baba is on line. Glory to Baba's mother! - Glory to my mother. Tell me, what can I do for you? Baba, I should ask you that question. You have a lot of support from the public here and abroad. Your popularity is more that Barrack Obama. - Yes. Shower some popularity on me too.. ..so that my government starts. Your government will start, but what's my benefit in it? What do you want to say? I want you to come here and protest against.. ..corruption and inflation of our country. Put pressure on the government to make any law regarding this. If you pressurize them, the public, who is your disciple.. ..will go against the government. You support us till then, later.. I'll manage. Your work is a little crooked. As soon as the work is done, you have to give me a.. ..special benefit for this work. Keep that in mind. Baba, work is mine, but the price is yours. Work is yours and price is mine. Did you watch movie 'Sholay' before calling me? I was just kidding. One has to keep smiling. Your work will be done. - Thank you. Listen Tillu.. - Yes, sir. Send an e-mail from my ID to the government.. ..that I'm going on a strict protest from the 11th. Okay Baba, as you wish. I'll send an e-mail to the government tomorrow itself.. ..that your protest is confirm from 11th. Give it to me. - Give it to me. Don't cheat. - Give me. Brother Satya, we have to do a lot of work. How do we do it? - Mr. Satya? And they are.. - Tell me, what's the matter? There are some children in .. .. this village who haven't got any education. You do something about their education .. ..or they all will be illiterate. No, son. No child will be illiterate. Am I right? - Yes. We have NGO's support. I'll take them along and bring books for all the children. Shall we leave? - Okay. Very good. Go and play. - Okay. Come on, let's play. - Come on. Give it to me. - Pass it to me. Here. Yes. - Give it to me. We are giving you books on behalf of the government. Hello. - Here, you also have a look. How are you, dear? Give it to the children also. Brother Satya, what is this? These are books. I'm distributing these to all the children of this village. What's the use? Your children will get education and my country will progress. Our hunger is standing between education and progress. What about the hunger? This is the bitter truth. This is the truth. When children go and work in hotels.. ..only then they will be able to cook food at home. But child labor is.. Yes, the government has made a law about child labor.. ..and has also sentenced a punishment. 8 crore children of our country does child labor. They are earning for their family. We have to stop these children from doing child labor. If we stop them from working, how will they survive? Where do these children work? Come with me. See this. This is the tea stall where children work. Brother Satya, forgive me. - Why? I'll tell the children not to work here from now on. You don't sack them. You leave them at 5 o'clock in the evening.. ..so that they can go to school and study. I'll leave all the children at 5 in the evening. - Okay. Greetings. When he leaves you at 5, will you go and study? - Yes. Will you go and study daily? Will you go? Yes. - Very good. Mr. Gopinath. Forget it. We can talk about this later. If you want Baba to protest, then note his dates first. Yes, let me tell you one more thing. Baba's lucky number is 9. So, the advance payment should be 9 crores. Did you understand what I said? The other thing is that.. the deal that was done between us.. ..it has to be paid in two installments. Mr. Tillu, you don't worry. I'll send 9 crores to you. You start the work. - Then you don't worry. Your work will be surely done. My job is to plan things. - Plan? The thing is that.. ..I'm sending an e-mail from Baba's ID to the government. Is it? What will be written in the mail, I mean, in the notice? It will be written in the mail that if the government doesn't make.. ..any law regarding inflation and corruption till the 10th.. ..I, Baba Laxman Dev will protest in .. .. the Ram Leela ground on the 11th. Wow! This will be fun. The cabinet of the government will spend sleepless nights then. Yes. - But Mr. Tillu, what about the public? Mr. Gopinath, you don't worry about the public.. Baba has full support from the public. Baba will handle the rest. Glory to! - Baba's mother! Your duty is to welcome every disciple who comes into this hermitage. Not only disciples, welcome me also. Is it? - Yes. I give you your payments and salaries. - Oh. Mobile.. one minute. Hello? Mr. Tillu, the cash has been deposited in your bank account. Check it once. - The payment has been deposited in the bank. That means, the money has been transferred. Then the protest on 11th is confirmed. Hello, Prime Minister. - Hello. What is the solution for Baba? I don't do anything without the order from the high command. What will happen now? - You don't worry. I'll talk to the High command. - Okay. Hail India. - Hail India. Mr. Jainath, why are you sitting quietly from a long time? I think you want to say something. Tell me what it is. Mr. Jainath, tell whatever you want to. Why are you beating around the bush? Sir, you very well know what I want to say. Look, Mr. Gopinath's protest has been sponsored by you.. ..everyone knows that. What is it about Baba? Mr. Jainath, this Baba is very famous in this country. You don't know about him, Mr. Jainath. When this Baba will go on protest in this country.. ..then all the followers of this country and abroad will.. .. support him then this government will go haywire. If the government goes haywire, my business will flourish. Wonderful, sir. King of Lanka, my nose was chopped. What did you say? Your nose was chopped? I'll be ruined if the protest doesn't begin on the 11th. Why are you talking about the protest? We're performing our 'Raam Leela' play on the 11th. The announcement has been made everywhere. See this. I know, there'll be protest as well as the play. We will handle everything in short. What do you mean? - Shouldn't I show Lord Ram's birth? Should I directly start Ram's exile? How is this possible? - Everything is possible. But how? - I've given advance money to Mr. Tillu. Advance? - Try to understand. I'll slap you. Why did you give the advance? Do you want to cheat people in the name of Lord Ram? Will you become a demon? We'll adjust everything. - How? I'm the director of 'Raam Leela'. Children are preparing from so many days. Only 'Raam Leela' will take place here and that's final. There won't be any protest. Listen to me. What a strange man he is. Mr. Kantelal, why are you so angry? What's the matter? Son, I'm showing him Lanka made of gold.. ..and he is planning to burn it down like Lord Hanuman. Okay. - This is not okay, it is wrong. He was right hand of Lord Ram. So, he burnt down the Lanka. I'll not let you do this wrong deed in God's name. Calm down. We'll sit and talk. They are asking the ground only for three days. It is not a ground.. - Calm down. ..this is a 'Raam Leela' ground. Sorry, my mistake. 'Raam Leela' ground. Please, give your consent now. - Shut up. I'll not do this wrong deed. I'm feeling ashamed of myself thinking.. ..I was working with a man.. ..who loves money, and not God. - You stay quiet. You are corrupted. Mr. Kantelal, I'm respecting you because.. - Calm down. ..your grandfather and my grandfather are organizing.. ..the 'Raam Leela' show from many decades. That's the reason you took money for the ground. Calm down. Calm down. The people who didn't change even after seeing 'Raam Leela'.. ..or watching Ramayan, will they reform seeing 'Raam Leela' this year? I've decided it. 'Raam Leela' will start from the fourth day this year. - Calm down. There'll be a protest first. - There won't be any protest here. Hereafter, there won't be any rehearsal for the drama too. Calm down. Will you stop the rehearsal? - Yes. Then what about my protest? I've already taken advance for it. I've seen many people who take advance. - Calm down. I'll not let anything happen here. Neither the protest nor the 'Raam Leela.' - Calm down. Brother, listen to me. Rahul.. Rahul.. - Priya. Rahul.. praise me. Is it? Listen to me. "Twinkle, twinkle little star. How I wonder what you are?" Shut up. No, darling. "Up above the world.." Rahul, I feel like strangulating your neck. Why darling? Why are you saying like this? What do you mean by why? I'm telling you to praise me, but you are singing poetry for me. That too, 'twinkle, twinkle'. Oh.. - What's wrong in it? Rahul, where's the romance. Twinkle name itself sounds like romance. You haven't seen my neighbor, Twinkle. What? Are you comparing me to Twinkle? No.. - This means, you like her more than me. I hate you, Rahul. I'm going. Please, sorry. Sit here. Sorry. - Sorry? Yes, sorry. Hello, sir. Have you seen Urmila and Laxman? I've to take costumes from them. Their costume must be with them. Do you know where the love birds are found? On the stairs. She is Twinkle, but you are the moon. Twinkle always loses its light in front of the moon. Really? - Yes. I love you, Rahul. - Then why do you get angry on me? Rahul, what do I do? You talk like that. We both meet in the pretext of the rehearsal of 'Raam Leela'. You are too much.. Your father, Kantelal doesn't let us both meet. Rahul.. - What do I do? I yearn for days to meet you. Darling, what do I do? I'm helpless. You don't do anything. I'll abduct you one day from right under his nose. Priya! - Oh my God, it is dad's voice. If he sees you with me, then I'll be in trouble. Your father is a thorn. He keeps piercing me. Rahul, I shall leave. Don't worry. Bye. - Bye. Mr. Gopinath, how will we start the work? You haven't sent us the payment till now. Mr. Tillu, you got the advance, didn't you? Mr. Gopinath, advance means vermillion dot. Not vermillion, but sandalwood dot. Applying sandalwood dot means,.. ..it is confirmed that the work will be done. It doesn't mean the work is going to start. So, if you want us to work.. Mr. Tillu, you please start the work. Don't stop the work. I'll send you the payment as soon as possible. We'll start the protest as soon as you send us the money. Glory to! - Baba's mother! How much money have we collected in the party fund? A little has been collect, a little has to be collected.. ..and we hope that some more will be collected in few days. What's going on? You can't collect money like this. I'll tell you how to collect money. - Tell me. Is your cell ringing? - No boss, not mine. Is your cell ringing? - No. My cell is ringing. Where? It is here, it is here. My cell is ringing. Hello? I'm Pratap Singh Pratap speaking from Ausarwadi party. Can I talk to Makkhi Dada? One minute, don't move. What happened? - He told me not to move. Why? - I think he is crazy. The call is for Makkhi Dada. Who is Makkhi Dada? - You are Makkhi Dada. You should've told this to me earlier. You should've told this to me earlier. Will you defame me in front of others? I'm Makkhi Dada. - Makkhi Dada? Hello Dada, I'm Pratap Singh Pratap speaking from Ausarwadi party. Brother Pratap, tell me. Do you want me to kill someone or break their bones? No Dada, I didn't call you to give you a contract to kill someone. I called you to give good news. Brother Pratap, that's wonderful. You called me to give good news. Wonderful.. that means, it is something of my benefit. Brother Pratap, tell me what it is. Dada, actually the thing is that Mr. Gopinath has decided.. ..that he'll make you a respectable man in the society. He wants to give you a good post in his party.. ..and has decided to make you contest the election.. ...and become a minister. Really? Brother Pratap, will I become a minister? That means, the policemen who used to chase me until now.. ..will salute me. - Sure, they'll salute you. This is the truth of our country. This is the thing happening in our country. Isn't it, Dada? But there's a problem in it. Actually the thing is, if you have to make any party strong.. ..you need funds. It would be nice if something can be done about it. Brother Pratap, you want money? Tell me, how much do you want? Where do I have to give it to? Tell me. - Dada, I'll do one thing I'll SMS my account number.. ..and RTGS code on your mobile. R? What does that mean? Boss.. RTGS code. - I'm asking them. What does that mean? Boss, this is the new way to transfer money. Oh, you are an educated guy. - Yes, boss. You transfer the money in that account. Okay. Okay. Wonderful. Who is Pratap? - Oh, boss. I was talking about few days, but the arrangement has been made. Very good. Is the work done? - Yes. Write down the names. - Yes, tell me. Note it down. Call the builders. - Yes. Yes, tell me. Builder.. - Tell him, as soon as I win the elections.. ..all his illegal businesses will become legal. - Okay. Number 2.. the owner of speak India. Call him. Yes, I'll call him. He has given false hopes to people have cheated many of them. He'll give you. - Before the police reaches to him.. No. No. Sir, he'll come home and give you money. That's done. - Okay? Call him. - Tell me. 'Rahul it has been many days since I saw you or met you.' 'Now I can't bear to stay away from you.' 'Think of some way to meet.. Priya.' Dad, I want to talk to you about something important. Yes, tell me son. Priya and I love each other very much and we want to marry. Will you take my alliance to their house? My enemy's daughter will become the daughter-in-law of my house? This is impossible! I'll never let this happen. Is this your final decision? - Yes. This is my final decision. I'll eat this poison and die. I can't live without her. - No, son. I'll commit suicide. - Son, give that to me. I.. Mom, I will not stop now. - Leave that. Why don't you agree to him? If he does something, then I'll kill myself. No, you don't do anything like that. Okay, I'll take your alliance to them. I'll go. Dad hasn't returned yet. I don't know whether Kantelal gave his consent or not. God, please make Kantelal accept it. I can't take this tension anymore. I'll call Priya. Hello? - Hello. Rahul, our love won. Have fun and distribute sweets to everyone. Priya.. what happened? What did your dad tell my dad? Rahul, you should've seen that situation. Do you know? When your dad asked for alliance from my dad.. ..then do you know what did dad say? - What? He said, this alliance can never happen. 'Shukla, I'll never marry my daughter into greedy people like you.. ..who are ready to sell even the God for money.' Your dad rejected our marriage proposal.. ..and you are telling me to be happy and distribute sweets? Rahul, did you forget what you had said? Didn't you say, 'whenever the love has been kept in barriers.. ..it becomes more stronger'. We can never come out of the barriers. Rahul, you got scared for such petty thing. You don't know that I've added one more spice to make.. ..our love more stronger. What have you done? Rahul, I told my dad clearly that.. ..I'll marry only Rahul. I love Rahul. Do you know what my dad did? - What? Dad has locked me in a room. He has told me.. ..'Let me see how you meet that vagabond Rahul now'. 'Beware, if you try to come out of this room'. 'If you dare to do so, I'll break your legs'. To hell with him. Nothing will happen now. Why don't you do something? What else do I do? We had been everywhere, isn't it? MP, MLA, and commissioner.. Everyone say, 'wonderful. You are doing a good job'. 'You are helping people. May God bless you'. How will the God bless me? They don't take our talks seriously. No one listens to us. We need a man who is known by the people. There's one man who will listen to us. - Who? Baba Laxman Dev. - Baba Laxman Dev? - Yes. Brother, don't get fooled by these saints and imposters. We can't trust them. They are wolf in a lamb's disguise. No. This Baba is not like that. He is considered as Lord Ram of this era. His name is Laxman Dev. He will listen to us. He will make everyone understand. I'll talk to him. If you say, we can trust him. We have to go to him. Let's go. - Yes, let's go. Rahul, you are futile. - Why do you say so? I want to say only one thing about you.. ..that your father's and Priya's father enmity.. ..is going to cost you much. Because of these two old men.. ..I don't think 'Raam Leela' is going to take place this year. Why won't 'Raam Leela' take place? What has it got to do with 'Raam Leela'? If not this year, it will be conducted next year. Practice it. Baba is not going to protest next year. Why aren't you rehearsing? Very good, pal. So that you and Priya would meet. Start rehearsing first. You'll know about this only when Baba returns. When is Baba coming? Glory to! - Baba's mother! Glory to! - Baba's mother! Disciples.. how many temples are.. ..in Lord Ram's father, Dhashrath's name? Not even one. - Not even one. How many temples are in name of His ardent devotee, Lord Hanuman? There are lakhs. - Lakhs. This proves that being a father is no big deal.. ..you have to be someone's disciple. Glory to! - Baba's mother! Glory to! - Baba's mother! You all are disciples. I'm proud of it. I'm more proud that you all are my disciples. I'm going to introduce you to my beloved and great disciple. His name is Satya. Baba, greetings. - Live long, my son. Baba, greetings. You'll be happy to know that you've become a member.. ..of this hermitage and have become my disciple. Okay. - Go to every village and preach about my greatness. As you wish. Mr. Tillu, give me the garland. - Take it yourself. From now on, you are Satya Baba. Wherever you go, you'll praise me. Go. Glory to! - Baba's mother! Glory to! - Baba's mother! Glory to! - Baba's mother! Glory to! - Baba's mother! 'Viewers, a new whiff of revolution is blowing in the country.' 'That is, move inflation and reduce corruption.' 'This revolution has been brought by.. ..Baba Laxman Dev Prasad.' 'Come on, let's talk to Baba Laxman Dev Prasad.' Greetings, Baba. - Greetings. May you all be happy! 'Baba, you are going on a protest.' 'Do you think the country will be benefited by it?' 'Why not?' 'Have you ever read the history of this country?' 'I've read it in school.' 'You read it in the school, but you forgot about it in the college.' 'You were having fun.' 'It is not just your problem, but every youth of this country.. ..faces same kind of problem.' 'Our great country is known for protests.' 'Because of the protest Gandhi, our beloved father.. ..had thrown the Britishers out of this country.' 'This is mere corruption and inflation.' 'Why wouldn't it be solved because of this protest?' 'I want to request all the citizens of this country..' Mr. Pratap. - Yes? 'I'll be going on a protest from the 11th of this month.' See this.. Baba. - 'The corruption and inflation.. ..should disappear from our country.' 'My beloved country should get freedom from all these problems.' 'This will be my protest unlimited.' 'God bless you all.' 'Baba told us his plans and how he will take forward this problem.' 'That's all for the new tonight. Goodbye.' Mr. Gopinath, Baba has made our job easy. Call him immediately and thank him. Yes. - Take his blessings. You are right. Thank you. Thank you, Baba. Tell me, Mr. Gopinath. How did you remember me? Baba, you are wonderful. Your protest unlimited company is a super hit. Wonderful. - If I have to fit in the public,.. ..then I have to become a hit. Tell me, what made you call me? Baba, I've spoken to Tillu about everything. If you have any problem, please let me know. - Yes. There's a problem. I want you to do me a favor. Get us permission in Raam Leela ground for us to protest. Whenever we have to protest.. ..we have to acquire the Raam Leela ground. It is a lucky ground. - Is that all? We'll talk to Kantelal. - I'll handle him. Glory to! - Baba's mother! Let's go. I'll break it, destroy it! I'll break it, destroy it! Basanti, if you open your mouth, I'll shoot him. You scoundrel, speak up. Who are you, sir? Who am I? - Boss, you are Makkhi Dada. The great underworld don.. Makkhi Dada Makkhi Dada? - Did you hear that? I am Makkhi Dada. Tell me what do you want from me? Speak up. - Boss, it is Raam Leela. Which Raam Leela.. - Protest. Which protest? Protest? - Yes. Scoundrel, listen to me carefully. Until the protest doesn't get over.. ..there won't be any 'Raam Leela' play on that ground. Is that clear? - Yes. Let's go. He has understood it. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Oh my God. Makkhi Dada, tell me. Is the work done? The work is done. The work is done. - Very good, Makkhi Dada. You've made Gopinath happy. Thank you, Mr. Gopinath. Thank you, Mr. Gopinath. The work had to be done. The work is done, Mr. Gopinath. Very good. Listen, who is Gopinath? Mr. Gopinath, tell me. Glory to! - Baba's mother! Baba, the Raam Leela ground is ready for the protest. I'm very happy. Mr. Gopinath, you take rest. I have to make arrangements for the protest. Tillu, we've got permission for the Raam Leela ground. Make arrangements for the protest. God bless you. Hello. Hello, Mr. Subedar. Mr. Jainath, the protest is confirmed. I've organized a party at my office.. ..in the evening to celebrate the protest. I want you to attend it and celebrate. I'll surely come.. but my friend, pop singer,.. ..Shankar Sahani is here with me. If you say, shall I get him along? Yes, you get all your friends. Okay, then we'll meet in the evening.

Hello? - Darling, how are you? How can I be without you? I've lost weight thinking about you and waiting for you. It looks as though I've enrolled myself in a weight loss plan. Shut up. Don't joke. Trust me. I'll plan something for us to meet. Don't worry. I love you. - I love you too. Latchu, you are stretching yourself. Tillu.. - Tell me, Latchu. When I was abroad.. what do I tell you? - Tell me, Latchu. The fair disciples who came to meet me. When they used to massage me, I used to feel so relaxed. I used to bless them wholeheartedly. I used to see Malika Sherawat in all the disciples there. Oh, disciple looked like Malika Sherawat to you? Even I'm your disciple. - You are a disciple. Do you know what the difference between you two is? What? - They are Malika Sherawat and you are a useless guy. Do you think yourself to be king? Don't make me reveal your secrets now. You were praising Satya so much in your lecture yesterday. Satya will die. He didn't die in the first film, isn't it? - Yes. I'll make such a film on him that he'll surely die in this film. Whoever is in front of me, I mean, people live and live people.. ..people live. Everyone will kill him. Satya will die. - Yes. I've done a deal of 20 crores. Your disciple.. Mr. Gopinath, who stays in Delhi.. ..I took 9 crore rupees advance from him. I kept that money with me for one month and then.. ..transferred 8 crore rupees in your international account. Thief, stop eyeing on my money. Is it? I am thief? - Yes. Did you forget that before you became a Baba (sage).. ..you used to rob people? I made you a Baba, now you are going on foreign trips.. ..and I'm travelling on a bullock cart. Listen.. - Don't make me reveal your secrets. No, shut up! Listen to me. I had been abroad. - Yes, you did. I'll become an international Baba. After that, who'll take care of the Indian territory? Fool, it will be you. - Yes. I'll take full charge into my hands. - Then what. And in abroad, I'll open an AATC. - AATC? What is it? 'Aamaran Anshan (protest) training center'. Wonderful. The branches of it should be opened in all of India. A branch of this should be opened in every city. AATC. - Do you know how many people will start protesting then? You'll have to handle all of them. - Yes. I feel like kissing you and embracing you, my Latchu. Oh baby.. - Rahul! Rahul, where are you? Do you know, my dad comes to drop me and pick me? I've got stuck here. I know better than you. Do you know how worried I am? I'm always scared thinking your dad would come from here or there. He has made my life miserable. Your dad must be coming here from somewhere. - No. Dad is coming to pick me. Rahul, please do something. Please do something. When will we meet? My classes finish and your's start. Even our periods are different. - We are not able to meet. Since the Ram Leela rehearsals have stopped.. ..our lives have become miserable. They've troubled us so much. Oh my god. Dad.. it is dad's car. Bye. - Bye. If course. - Answer the phone. Sir.. - Greetings, Baba. Sir, you just get your work done with greetings. Greetings? Do you have any culture in you? Send some gift for me. Like.. I don't have a car to commute. You could've sent me 2-4 Mercedes. You are just telling me greetings. You could've gifted 4-5 bungalows to me as hermitage. You could've gifted me a charted flight. - Yes. You could've sent me on a foreign trip. - Yes. I heard that you are friendly with Malika Sherawat.. ..you could've introduced her to me once. But you just say greetings and escape. Baba, everything that belongs to me is yours. I know that. Everything that belongs to you is mine. But I'm feeling very bad that you are delaying the time of protest. I'm very sorrowful. Is there any problem with the protest? The biggest problem of this world is money. You know that you have to spend a lot of money for protest. That is a protest. You are not sending water. - Water? I mean, money. I'm not getting any money from you. You don't worry, Baba. Only two days are left for the protest. You'll get the money deposited in your account before 6 today. 100% - God bless you. Glory to! - Yes, glory to my mother! Tillu.. - Yes? If we get the balance payment before 6 in the evening.. ..then we'll organize a cocktail party at 9. We'll eat chicken biryani. Our slogan is: 'Vermillion dot in the morning.. ..and chicken tikka at night.' - Chicken tikka. Hello, uncle. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. - Have a seat. Thank you, uncle. You must be here for the rehearsal, right? - Yes, uncle. Yes. - It is nice that you come on time daily. But there has been a change in it. There's a renowned goon named Makkhi Dada. He came and threatened me and shot a few bullets at our house. He threatened me and aunt.. that he would kill us.. ..if we try to organize the 'Ram Leela' play. Son.. I've decided that we'll not rehears for Ram Leela now on. Forgive me. - Uncle, please don't say that. Don't stop 'Raam Leela.' At least, don't stop the rehearsals. Son, there's no use of rehearsing now.. ..because we are not organizing Ram Leela. If they see us rehearsing, then they'll come and fire bullets. They had fired bullets at the lawn that day. Uncle, I'll talk to my dad. He'll surely tell us a solution. He himself will go and pacify Makkhi Dada. Uncle, please don't do that. Please, don't stop it. Son, I don't think he'll listen to anyone. He is very dangerous. Everyone, please forgive me. I'll not be able to go on with the rehearsal. Please, uncle. - I can't go ahead with Ram Leela. Please. - Forgive me. I won't be able to do that. When Kantelal has already decided that Ram Leela won't take place.. ..what can we do? Rahul, your father didn't do the right thing by taking advance money. These two old men ruined the Ram Leela. You mean, there's no other way out, isn't it? We have to find a way out. Makkhi Dada closed all the ways. Only Makkhi Dada can come out with a solution now.. ..about starting Ram Leela and even for our meetings. Where will we find Makkhi Dada? I know where you can find Makkhi Dada. He is Makkhi Dada. He? - He stays in this vehicle. Do as I instructed you. - Yes. Your work will be done. Good luck, guys. All the best. Okay. What's the use of crying now, Priya? We can never meet now. All this will happen because of Makkhi. He won't let Ram Leela take place. No Rahul, don't say that. No matter we meet or not.. or if we die after separation.. ..but we'll not say anything to Makkhi Dada. He has not only stopped Ram Leela, but has also separated two lovers. Rahul, God will surely punish him for this. You wait and watch. Look, how deeply they are in love with each other. I wish to applaud their love. Who is Makkhi Dada? Find out where he lives. What does he do? I swear. The day I catch hold of him, I'll strangulate his neck and roast him. What is this? - Look into this. Who is this? This is me. - It is you. The great underworld don, Makkhi Dada. Glory to Makkhi Dada! Glory to Makkhi Dada! Makkhi Dada! - Please help us, Makkhi Dada. Please, help us. - Leave me. No problem. I'll take the boat of your love to the shore. Kantelal will organize the Ram Leela himself. Really? - Yes. How? - This is easy. I'll talk to Kantelal right away. Hello? - Is it Kantelal speaking? Makkhi Dada? - What about Ram Leela? No, Ram Leela. - No, Ram Leela? It is yes.. yes Ram Leela. Ram Leela will surely take place there. Mr. Rahul has explained everything to me. - Mr. Rahul? Yes. If you don't organize Ram Leela, then Mr. Rahul will feel bad. If Mr. Rahul is sad, then I'll feel bad. If I feel bad, then.. - Okay. He understood. Who is Kantelal? Yes, yes.. no, I'm not lodging a police complaint. Makkhi's tension is over now. Okay. Okay. Hello, uncle. - Hello, son. Come in. I'm fine, uncle. - How are you, son? Have a seat. Why are you sitting there? Come and sit closer to me. - Okay, uncle. You have done wonders. Very good. What have I done? - I had lost complete hope.. ..that how will this Ram Leela take place. You've done a great job. I'm very happy. My point of view towards you has changed. I was thinking that you are like your father. But no, you are a nice human being. Son, you've done a great job. I'm very happy. Uncle, thank you. This was my duty. Don't say that. If your point of view towards me has changed.. ..can I ask you something? Sure, son. What do you want? Ask me. Uncle, can I ask you.. - Tell me. Uncle, can I ask for Priya's hand from you? You'll surely get a hand. - Is it? Not Priya's, but mine. Is it okay with you? Yes, Baba. Yes, Baba. No problem. Full and final will be done by evening. Okay, you don't worry. Okay, Baba. Yes, Baba. It will be done. I touch your feet, Baba. I removed my hand. Yes.. no, I'll call you back. Yes, okay. Thank you. Sir, Baba is calling again and again. This Baba is prepaid. If he doesn't get money on time.. ..then the connection will be disconnected. My pressure will go up. You call Mr. Subedar. - Okay, I will call him. Call him. Mr. Gopinath. Yes, Mr. Subedar. The planning of the protest is going on well. Yes. Ask him for money. - They are starting the protest in two weeks. The final installment is yet to come. Mr. Gopinath, how many times have I told you? You'll get the money on time. You just start the arrangements for the protest. The protest should go on well. - Thank you. It is coming. - It is coming. Brothers! You have to start preparing for the protest in full zoom. Okay. - There's no dearth of money. Sure. - Come on, hurry up. - Hello? Glory to my mother. - Glory to her. Tillu, the money has been arranged. - Yes. We can start the protest anytime now. - Okay. Do one thing.. with proud arrange for a good crowd. Sir, that's the main problem. Where will we get the crowd from? The crowd sits in reality shows. They get Rs. 1000 per day as well as three square meals. When will we make use of Satya? He already has long hair. He can grow a beard. Yes. - He is an upcoming Baba. Tell him, he'll get some innocent people from his village. You are right. - Exactly. But listen to one thing. - Yes. Tell Satya to have bath whenever he comes to the office. And you are aware of my character and behavior. When I protest I want my tempo to my high. So make 20-25 models between the age group.. ..of 20-25 sit in front of me. Ms. Raina, the coordinator of the models.. ..I will call her. Don't you work as a coordinator anymore? I quit at the same time you did. - Okay. Call her. Hello. Ms. Raina, greetings. Tillu speaking. Glory to Baba. We require 20-25 beautiful girls for the protest. Money? How much? Rs. 2000 per day? Wait. I will discuss with Baba and call you back. Baba, she is asking for Rs. 2000 per day. But will the girls sit after paying them money? They will also sleep if you want to. Are the girls lazy? I don't want lazy girls. I want girls who participate in the protest and listen to me. I want such girls. You get started with your work. Satya is outside, please take care of him. I will go outside and make Satya understand. Our country is famous for protests. Because of protest, Gandhi, our beloved father.. My life has become miserable.. ..and you are more interested in watching TV? You're mistaken. I'm watching the news about the protest. The entire country's eyes are on this protest news. What is it about the protest news? This is not an ordinary protest. Our country has been a victim.. ..of inflation and corruption for several years. Baba is trying to convince them through the protest. So if I go on hunger strike or protest.. ..can Priya and I get married? Of course. The best option is to protest to fulfill your demands. In that case, it's final. I'm going to protest. Then, sit down and protest wherever you are. It's final, I'm going to protest. - Okay. Oh, my God. Everything has become a mess. Mr. Tillu, what happened? You look worried? Mr. Satya, what do I tell you? People are asking for money to participate in the protest. Rs. 500 per day. Apart from that, pilaf as well. As if Baba is getting married. We don't want such greedy people. We want people who are concerned about the country.. ..those who have the passion to share people's sorrows.. ..those who are patriotic. But unfortunately, honest people like you are hardly found. Mr. Tillu, don't worry. I will bring people from different villages. - Really? - Yes. Where are your feet? - No. I will tell people about Baba's thought about doing good to people. And I will bring true Indians for the protest. Even the youths of this country is with us. Very good. Keep trying. Now go and bring the team of patriots. By the way, Mr. Tillu, I've already told people about Baba. That's really great. Put your hand on my hand. - Well done. Protest! Protest! Who is this insolent? I will protest, I don't fear Mr. Kantelal. Security. - Protest! Watchman! Rahul, you are very drunk. Go away from here. You go inside. He is drunk. I will handle him. Go inside. - Come on. Father-in-law, you don't accept me as your son-in-law. Listen to me. Now you will get my darling Priya.. ..married to me yourself. Drinking liquor you've gone out of your mind. Father-in-law. - Watchman throw him out. I will now go on a hunger strike. Hunger strike! - Take him away from here. I will protest for sure. - Useless. I will.. protest. Hello? Chief Minister, I have a information for you. I see. - You will be shocked hearing it. What is it? - I learnt who is financing Gopinath. It is Subedar. I see. It's Subedar Singh. - Yes. Alright. I will deal with him. What are you saying, sir? I took up this work after you suggested me. Now if you do this, it's unfair. The protest is about to begin in two days. Sir.. sir, you were supposed to demolish the government. Now what happened? Look Mr. Gopinath, I've told you several times.. ..that bad times are unpredictable. I've already given you a lot of money. I can't give you money anymore. I erred, Mr. Gopinath. I'm sorry. Mr. Gopinath, getting worried will not help. Then what will I do? It's Chief Minister. Hello? I have no time to say 'hello.' Yes, Chief Minister? You are acting very smart these days. No Chief Minister, as per your orders I've stopped the protest. Very good. - Yes. Stop your melodrama. You are my son's friend. Sir, thank you. Thank you. Glory to Mr. Tillu! - Bless you. Sir. - What's the matter, Rahul? You are an omniscient. You know my name. I know everything about your family. How is your love affair going on? - Very bad, sir. I'm in such a trouble. The girl's father is not giving his consent. If that is the case then there's just one solution. Start protesting. Sir, that's why I have come to you. The protest is not open for public. One needs to spend money. - How much, sir? Rs. 5 lakhs. Where will get Rs. 5 lakhs from. Please reduce the price. Okay. Listen to me. I will charge Rs. 3 lakhs for sure. 3 lakhs? - 3 lakhs. Because I also need to bring up the issue about love. Alright. I will spend Rs. 3 lakhs for my love. Okay. Deposit Rs. 3 lakhs in my account. It will be my first work tomorrow morning. Why fear when you've fallen in love? So deposit Rs. 3 lakhs in my account. Go. - Thank you. The protest has brought good fortune for me. Baba's hermitage has progressed. This protest will turn us into billionaires. I would say, whatever God does will be the best. You were always right, Mr. Prashar. One should neither be a friend nor enemy of the politicians. The farer we are from them the better it is for us. - Mr. Subedar. Mr. Subedar. - Here he comes. Mr. Subedar, what am I hearing? - Hello, Jainath. You stopped the protest? What you heard is absolutely right. But why did you do so? After all, everyone knew that it was you who sponsored the protest. Then why are you doing this? Mr. Jainath, there can't be answer to every question. We have tied up with the ruling party. The benefit that we and our company were to get after the protest.. ..we got it even before the protest. Join hands with us and let's make the ruling party stronger. On whom we had faith and did this protest.. ..on whose saying we were about to form a government.. ..and on whom I had so much respect.. ..backed off after giving me all the encouragement. He hung up the phone saying 'sorry'. The government and dignity are at stake. Today, we're supposed to pay the remaining amount for the protest. How will we pay him now? Is there a solution? What do we do now? There is.. There is one solution. The solution which will help the protest to take place.. ..and also form our government. Baba, Pratap here. I touch your feet, Baba. Mr. Pratap. Mr. Gopinath himself assured me that.. ..he will give me the money by evening. Baba, Mr. Gopinath was busy with the party meeting.. ..hence his phone was switched off. I apologize on his behalf. And this meeting was called for you. All the party workers wish that you contest the election. You will win for sure. That's really great. You will a get good portfolio in Mr. Gopinath's cabinet. You will become a minister. Alright, Mr. Pratap. The government will be formed later. Firstly, there will be protest and for that we will have to.. ..arrangement for money. Baba, it will be done. Everything will be alright with your blessings. You always have my blessings, Mr. Pratap. But this work will happen only with money not blessings. And you.. I got you. Baba, don't worry. Don't worry. The party has decided that.. ..Mr. Gopinath will give you the remaining amount.. ..in the presence of the audience during the time of protest. We hope you agree with it. Alright. I will trust you. Liars. Darn it. Praise the Lord! Yes, Mr. Satya. Listen to me, Mr. Tillu. There is a problem. People from many villages are ready to come for Baba's protest. But how will I bring them? Mr. Satya, don't worry. There is a big devotee of Baba. His name is Mr. Batia. He runs Batia transport. All this trucks pass by that village. Bring them in those trucks. Okay. Glory to! - Baba's mother! Bless me. - My respects. - Go. Latchu, what about Mr. Gopinath's remaining payment? He will do it. What are you doing here? Go for the protest. - When will you come for the protest? Call out the slogans, create an environment. I will come with the newspaper. Go. Glory to! - Baba's mother! Glory to! - Baba's mother! Glory to! - Baba's mother! Glory to! - Baba's mother! Glory to! - Baba's mother! Glory to! - Baba's mother! Silence, devotees. I'm about to protest against the inflation.. ..and corruption in the country. Look there. - Who. We will meet.. - Baba is here. ..in Ram Leela Ground. Glory to! - Baba's mother! Glory to! - Baba's mother! The day for which the entire country.. ..was been waiting has finally come. The day where inflation and corruption will be put to end. And to start the protest.. ..Baba has left to Ram Leela Ground from this hermitage. Before going to Ram Leela Ground.. ..Baba Lakshman Dev is passing by Jantar Mantar.. ..on his way to Ramleela Ground. The followers of Baba say that Baba saw Jantar Mantar from his car.. ..and he liked the unique way of seeing time in it.. ..so he decided that he'd get a nice time in this country. Baba is just 15 minutes away from Ram Leela Ground. But before going for the protest.. ..he has stopped in Rajghat to seek Gandhi's blessings. We take the responsibility to keep the viewers updated.. ..with Baba's every movement. Let's see how much time will Baba take to reach Ram Leela Ground.. ..which is just 15 minutes drive. Protest after protest, that means new protest everyday. I don't understand what's going on and what to do. If there's protest everyday.. ..we will be done for. Lakshman Dev Latchu, get one thing clear. 9893.. - Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Mr. Tillu, Glory to! - Baba's mother! You were to send the truck, where is it? Look, I brought everyone here by walk. Where is Baba? Radhe Shyam. Baba will be reaching Ram Leela Ground. Just a minute. Let me take the call. Hello? Baton-charge at Ram Leela Ground? But why? Why? Because you've commenced the business of protesting.. ..but the store is not proper. What do you mean? What are you trying to say? You are playing with the emotions of these Indians and the poor. You are playing with the emotions of the Indians They participate in your protest and call out slogans.. ..and then they are beaten by the police.. ..because you didn't seek.. ..government's permission to conduct protest.. ..in Ram Leela Ground. That's why. Hey you. Don't tarnish Baba's image. Yes. Don't put Baba to shame. No one knows where Lakshman Dev Prasad disappeared all of a sudden. He had left to Ram Leela Ground from his hermitage for the protest.. ..but where, how and why did he disappear all of a sudden. As of now, it has become big question. This is the historical place where Baba was standing. But Baba is not in this car. That means Baba has fled. This is Dwarka Prasad with cameraman Sachin.. ..Live India Delhi. Look, Baba has fled. We were to teach him politics. He fled with billions. How will we now form a government? Baba! - Glory! Shut up. - Calm down. Sit down. Not me you said it. It was you who said 'Baba will protest why we should be concerned.' 'Baba will form a government.' This is what you had said. If sages like him start forming government.. ..politicians like us should wear underwear and sit in the hermitage. Do you have underwear or shall I order for one? Shut up. The protest has begun but no of Baba Lakshman Dev's. The protest has begun in a new place and not Ram Leela Ground. Seems like the today's youths have woke up. So let's go to the place where Satya and his associate are present. Why hasn't your Baba arrived yet? Where is he? Mr. Tillu, tell us where is Baba? Baba must be coming. - Baba has fled. What are you saying? - The imposter has fled. I told you he was a fraud. Idiot. Baba fled away. It is a lie. Baba can never do that. I got a call from the channel. Baba had fled. Getting scared like a coward, Baba fled abroad. Mr. Tillu and Baba's true color has been revealed. No, it can't be. - What happened? Why are you quiet? Yes, I sinned. I committed a grave mistake. Please forgive me. Satya, it is true. Lakshman Dev Latchu, the culprit, he is a thief. We both were thieves. We used to steal. All of a sudden, Latchu decided to make billions. In the name of religion and devotion.. ..he looted thousands of people. I too was manipulated by him. I got fooled too. And Latchu fled leaving me behind. I committed a grave mistake. I sinned. Forgive me. forgive me, my friend Satya. Down to Baba! Down to Baba! - Silence! Not Baba, but I've fooled. You all are fooled. All the Indians are fooled. We trust people like Lakshman Dev Baba. We shouldn't. Why do we forget that.. ..when demon Raavan abducted Goddess Sita.. ..he posed as a sage. Even in the modern era there are sages who are looting us.. ..posing as sages. Every man in this country is engaged in looting the other. We meet imposters posing as sages at our every step. They loot us in the name of religion and devotion. It is our mistake. The government of our country.. ..declares holiday on the day of election.. ..so that the citizens cast their votes for a capable government. We are busy with other things on the day of election. Some want to go outing. When some are asked to come along to cast votes.. ..they wait for the dry day to pass by.. ..so that they can drink liquor. Dad, you see that? It's Rahul on the TV. - We did see him. It's Rahul. - I'm proud of your choice. Some want to go with their wives to watch movie. Some want to lie down in the garden. Some want to.. - Yashoda, we will get her married to Rahul. Really, dad? - Of course. Nobody goes to cast votes and we cry on times like these. It is you people who sell your votes just for Rs. 150-200. People, look at yourself first before blaming others. It is out of our mistakes.. ..we make imposters and criminals as our leaders. We make them our politicians. I promise you, my friends. I will go on a protest. I will put an end to corruption.. ..and inflation in this country. And you will grant all your support. And the whole India will grant support to me. We will support you. Hail motherland! "I want to become yours." "I want to become yours." "Why doesn't the government fall?" "Why don't we get jobs?"
