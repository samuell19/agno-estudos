Man: Comedy Cellar, how you feeling?! [ Cheers and applause ] Gold: All right, here we go. Topical, baby, topical! Trick or treat, mother[bleep] Carlos: I live in a white neighborhood. I'm gonna scare the shit out of people. I'm just gonna go as a black homeowner. Any Saudi Arabians here? No? All right. Let's talk some shit. Boston in the World Series. I can't wait to see, win or lose, a car get set on fire to a Dropkick Murphys song. Never said that joke before tonight. We'll move on. Is this too much information for you? I'm sorry. I thought we were live at the Cellar. I thought I could say whatever. ♪♪ Male Reporter: In several states tonight, an urgent search to find whoever's responsible for sending packages with a frightening-looking bomb inside. Carlos: Who do you think the bomber is? I think it's Banksky. [ Laughs ] Banks-- It's his new art exhibit. He shredded his picture. Right, he did. Now he's dropping bombs in everybody's shit. -Wow! -Yeah. Exclusive. If the bombs went off, it would actually be a lot of glitter. There's more. It would just be a lot of glitter. Glitter? [ Laughs ] I don't know how to say Banksky's name, fam. -You know what? -Is it Banksky or Basie? It's Banksy. Ba-- Is it B-A-S-K-Y? B-A-N -- like "bank." -Yeah? -And then -- "Sky"? Uh... Banksky. "Banks" with a "Y." I don't know how to say his name. [Bleep] him. It's Banksy. Yo! [Bleep] that guy. He's a terrorist. I don't know who sent those bombs to Obama and Hillary and George Soros, but I know whoever it is is gonna look a lot like me. I already know that. I -- I'm already getting ready for that. That shit happened to me after Charlottesville. I thought it was really great that, like, for the first time in his presidency, Trump was an adult today, you know? He, like, gave an adult speech and then didn't say anything weird, you know? Like, I was so expecting him to be like, "You know, uh, sidebar, uh, I like bombmakers that make bombs that go off." [ Laughter ] These bombs, yo, that he just sent out -- all the bombs. Who knew it was so easy to get Obama's address? Like, who knew that shit? I'ma be [bleep] sending Obama and Hillary everything. I'ma send... I'ma sign them up for Playboy and shit, just so I get them [bleep] Just Michelle all pissed off all the time. "Oh, yeah, I'm sure Ricky Velez sent you the Playboy again." [ Laughter ] Female Reporter: During a segment this morning about Halloween costumes, "Today Show" anchor Megyn Kelly stirred controversy with her remarks about dressing up in blackface. Back when I was a kid, that was okay as long as you were dressing up as, like, a character. Nigga, you can't [bleep] do it! [ Man laughs ] I just felt like you were my father. That was a lot. [ Laughter ] It's like when, like, the Papa John's dude used "nigga" -- like, he tried to use the word "nigga." You can't! Was that a kind of pizza? I don't remember that. I guess he wanted "nigga" topping. I don't know what it was. It always comes late. [ Laughter ] Sorry. Nigga pizza -- always late, never on time! It bummed me out 'cause I was planning to be Bill Cosby for Halloween, but... You know? 'Cause that's how you make blackface the second most offensive part of your costume. You dress as a rapist. [ Chuckles ] Do you like my Halloween costume? Woman: Whoo! No, I'm not wearing it, bitch! This! This is it! I'm going as 1/1,024 Native American. Do you see?! It's true, that's all it takes this Halloween, kids! It's just a little Elizabeth Warren magic. My friend told me, for Halloween, she's dressing her baby up as Hitler. Yeah. I was like, you know, "Be wary of time travelers, 'cause he's first on their kill list." I grew up with a [bleep] up costume. Do you remember those days? That plastic shitty mask, with that string in the back, just cutting through your [bleep] skull. And then there was a little slit for you to breathe in, but you would only stick your tongue through it. And they couldn't hear you say, "Trick or treat." "Meh-meh. [ Breathing heavily ] Meh-meh. [ Exhales sharply ] Meh-meh. Open the [bleep] door!" I have nieces. I have three nieces -- a big one, a middle one, and Elizabeth, but... Elizabeth is 8 this year, and I asked my sister, like, "What is she gonna be?" She and two of her friends, they're dressing up as feminism, past and present and future. It is the most disturbing -- They're 8. One of them is gonna be Rosie the Riveter, one is gonna be Gloria Steinem, and Elizabeth is wearing a pussy hat and some sort of power T-shirt. I was like... Woman: Yeah! And it's -- Yeah. It's -- They're [bleep] 8! You're probably like, "What scares black people?" I'm gonna tell you what scares black people -- real black people, like... No, no. Like -- Like, I mean, like from Africa. They can [bleep] yell quietly. Ooh-ooh-ooh! 'Cause you give 'em your best shit, like, "Yo, sho'nuff! [Bleep] your bitch... What?!" And they go [deep voice] "Listen. Do not speak to me in this manner. No, go away from me. Where are you from?" "From North Carolina, bitch." [ Laughter ] I don't like how women's costumes all seem to make traditional female jobs into slutty something-or-others, like slutty nurse. Halloween's supposed to be scary. No one is scared of a slut. [ Laughter ] If I'm in the hospital and I get the slutty nurse, I'm like, "Nice! This nurse is a slut. I prefer that, to be honest with you." [ Laughter ] No one's scared of a slut. No one's sitting around a campfire, telling a scary story. "And then what happened?" "This slut jumps out and starts blowing everyone. Whoa!" ♪♪ [ Laughter ] Man: So, Sarah Silverman -- she said that Louis masturbated in front of her. It was consensual. It was not a "Me, Too" thing. But I never understood that kink, masturbating in front of a woman. Isn't masturbating something you're supposed to do when the woman's not there? You know, I mean, the only way I'll masturbate in front of a woman is if a woman's doing it to me, and eventually, I'm like, "You know what? Give me that!" [ Laughter ] "For God's sakes, you don't know what you're doing, woman!" Female Reporter: Police have found evidence missing writer Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate. The gag is that all the information is coming from Turkey, that makes people disappear all the time. Like, Turkey is the best at this. Erdogan was like, "This was despic--" Like, you know it's bad when a ruthless dictator is like, "You guys got to chill." [ Laughter ] Yeah, I know. "Come on." I like that they were like, "We're investigating it." I'm like, "Oh, the thing you did? You're looking into it? That sounds like it's gonna be fair." That's like my credit-card company being like, "You're way overdue," and I'm like, "You know what? We looked into it, and we're all good, actually, so..." Oh, here's an idea for a joke. A Saudi journalist walks into a consulate. [ Laughter ] Woman: Too soon! Too soon! My friends are like, "Mike, can you believe that the Saudi Arabians killed a journalist?" I'm like, "Yes, I can." [ Laughter ] I would've done it a little differently. [ Laughter ] Okay? You keep the guy in the country, okay? You hire a woman to run him over with a car. And then you go, "It was a terrible accident, but we've been saying that women can't drive the entire time. Now do you believe us? Now do you believe us?!" Male Reporter: Thousands of migrants marching north through Mexico, hoping to reach the US. President Trump calling it a "national emergency," vowing to send in the US military. If you had to pick three comics to have to walk with you for that long, who would it be? Oh, my God. You. No. Yeah, yeah. Dude, I'm lazy. [ Laughs ] I'm taking Bobby Kelly. [ Ding! ] Bobby Kelly because he camps. He does camp, doesn't he? He camps. He camps a lot. Yeah. And at the same time, once he goes down, I can eat him. So now I'm eating Bobby Kelly. There's a caravan coming. [ Chuckles sarcastically ] [ Laughs ] It sounds like a whole [bleep] scary movie. There's a caravan of 7,000 Guatemalans. I've been to Guatemala. It's -- Let me... I went there twice. First time I went -- It's dangerous. It says on the Guatemala website, "Don't go." [ Laughter ] I swear. It says, "If you're American, you don't have to go. Don't come here. Stop. Go to Florida." So, you're Jewish? Yeah, 'cause if we had a caravan, it would be very different. I mean, it just would be tons -- thousands of people bent over like this, with this face, just, "When are we gonna get there?! My feet hurt! What do you mean, 1,000 miles?! What the hell is going on here?! Can't we get a reservation in one of these restaurants? I'm starving!" How the [bleep] you steal a job? I've never seen a Mexican walk into a restaurant -- "Give me the dishes!" [ Laughter ] "Rubber gloves on the ground! I'll see you tomorrow at 8:00! Nobody late!" "Do we have to pay you more?" "No! You pay me less money! Consider this job stolen, puto!" They keep making it scary, though. Every time they talk about it, [ Deep voice ] "7,500 migrants... heading to the border." [ Normal voice ] Let me tell you something. Anytime that many Hispanics come together, it's nothing but fun. You ever been to a [bleep] Hispanic party? That shit lasts four days. You ever go to a [bleep] A birthday party, you'll be in there for four days, like, "Yo, I think I lost my job, Hector." I am not racist. My whole thing about racism is like, "No!" [ Laughter ] The worst thing about racist people is that they're racist, but my favorite thing about racist people is that they're my grandparents. [ Laughter ] Female Reporter #2: Guess what? The Duchess of Sussex is pregnant! Who's Meghan Markle, first of all? She's the one who married the prince -- Harry. He's the younger one. -Okay. And she's also half black. So she could never be queen. So she'll never be accepted. [ Laughs ] Um... She can be Queen Latifah. All right. [ Laughter ] I'll let America decide whether that's racist or not. Why are people excited for Meghan Markle? It wasn't like she came from trash. Like, I could see if it was Cardi B. [ Laughter ] Dude, if Cardi B [bleep] Prince Harry, got married, had a baby, they'd go, "Anything is possible." I really hope she really holds down that black card, though. Like, I hope they name the kid, like... Man: No. "That's --" [ Chuckles ] [ Laughter ] "That's Prince Jamal over there." He got all Gucci on, just, "Yeah!" [ Laughter ] I hope that baby reaches back and grabs every black string of DNA, just the blackity-blackest. I hope that -- Here's the thing. I know Prince Charles feels the same way that I feel, as well, 'cause, guys, Queen Elizabeth is almost 100 years old. Like, he's been waiting for a good 20, 25 years for something to take her out. He was like, "Black great-grandbaby? This could be it." [ Laughter ] ♪♪ Lee: Have you guys heard of Elizabeth Warren? Everybody's, like, up in arms because Trump is calling her "Pocahontas." But, like, we've all heard Trump speak. Like, that's not what he wanted to call her. That was a compromise. Like, he wanted to call her, like, Elizabeth "Whoo-Whoo-Whoo-Whoo!" Warren. [ Laughter ] Elizabeth "Wah-wah-wah-wah, wah-wah-wah-wah, wah-wah-Washington Redskins" Warren. ♪♪ North of the border tonight, recreational marijuana is now legal across Canada. Female Reporter: By afternoon, stocks had run out in a few parts of the country. Once you get something legal, now you're gonna have, like, the nerds of nerds. Right. And they develop that wax shit. They put all the THC in the little wax. Yeah. Like, weed couldn't kill you, but I think now, after a few more nerds are on it... That's what I'm saying. ...it could kill you! That's why I don't [bleep] with those pens, 'cause I'm like, "If the weed cancer's coming, it's in those pens." The vape shit. Yeah. 'Cause we can't even tell what the hell that is. -For sure. -You know what's funny is I smoke the weed pens every day... Nah, bro. ...and my neck hurts, and now I'm going, "Oh, no. Oh, no." Canada feels like the stepdad to America's real dad, just really trying to win you over. You know, "Hey, we got some weed now. You like Drake? Drake's here. You like basketball? What do you think? Our basketball team's based on dinosaurs. You like that? We got free healthcare. Huh? Huh?" You're like, "Yeah, but when I'm with Dad, he doesn't make me learn French." I'm "sorey" if I offended you. Oh, it's "aboot" to get real. [ Chuckles ] [ Laughter ] When you're in a state where it's not legal, like, the dealer doesn't know what the [bleep] they're selling to you, you know? They're always like, "Yo, I got that strong-ass blueberry mnh?" [ Laughter ] "Premium, OG...man, uh, you can tell me." Like... They legalized weed in Canada, and now all of my friends want to do the drug tourist trip. "It's legal up there. We got to go up there. Let's smoke out in Canada." I'm not leaving the country, man. I'm not leaving the country right now. The block is hot. [ Laughter ] You leave America right now, you [bleep] around and lose your seat. You got to leave America now the same way you leave a nightclub. You got to check in with the bouncer. "Oh, hey, man, we're running to Canada real quick to make a phone call. Can you just remember you saw us? Just block the door real quick." [ Laughter ] ♪♪ I just actually saw Sam Jay for the first time tonight. -Really?! -Really?! I had never seen her before. Oh, no, that hooker's gifted. I thought she's very special. Khaghani: Yeah, she is. I have known her for a decade, and she is very, very good. How is that possible? She looks 23. Oooh! Right? I don't think we should be making people make gay cakes if they don't want to make gay cakes. Why are we trying to make people do shit with their passion they don't want to do? If you don't know the story, there's this bake shop in Colorado. Two gay people walked in and was like, "Hey, make me a gay cake." And then the dude was like, "I'd rather not," and they were like, "We're gonna make you!" And then it went all the way to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court was like, "Hey, bro, you don't got to make gay cakes." [ Laughs ] And he was like, "Cool," and that was it. And then gay people went crazy. And I didn't get why. Like, that is something very un-American about making someone do something with their passion they don't want to do. Why the [bleep] would we ever do that? It makes no [bleep] sense, 'cause some people think gay shit is wrong. They really do. They think that shit can send you to Hell. And they have the right to think that as much as I have the right to [bleep] a pussy. They truly do. They can think whatever the [bleep] they want. And if you're a person that believes that and then two dudes walk into your cake shop like, "A'ight [bleep] Make me a cake with two dicks kissing on the top in tuxedos!" and you're like, "Man, I can't help you out," fair enough. 'Cause I don't want my grandma to have to make cobbler for the KKK one day if she don't feel like it. You got to think about the flip of this shit. Robert Kelly. I think Robert is so brilliant. Fellas, you ever accidentally touch a man gently? [ Laughter ] Let me finish. Let me finish. You know what I'm tal-- Look at your face. You know what I'm talking about. You don't want to. You know what I mean? I did it with a bouncer here one night -- the big black dude. Big... "Why's he got to be black?" "'Cause he is." [ Laughter ] We punch fists. "What's up?" We punch fists, and my hand fell and his hand fell to our side, and the back of my hand touched the back of his hand gently by accident. Time stood still. I was like, "Noooooo." And I was like, "Dude, I'm sorry." He's like, "For what?" I'm like, "I just touched you gently by accident." He was like, "I don't know what you're talking about." I'm like, "That's bullshit. If I felt it, you felt it. That's how feelings work. Look at me. Look at me." ♪♪ ♪♪ My name is Mike Lawrence. I am originally from South Florida. You know, my mom was a stand-up comedian also, so I think that's where I learned a lot. ♪♪ My first stand-up comedy show is I saw her perform at a steak restaurant when I was 13 years old, and the guy that went on right after her was, like, one of my substitute teachers, so I never got to see this as glamorous. [ Chuckles ] ♪♪ I think the moment that I thought that stand-up could be something that I could do was my seventh year of being a slam poet and making no money in it, 'cause I'd be like, "He is the man behind the machine, if you know what I mean. He destroys my self-esteem." I literally thought that I was gonna buy a house with that. [ Laughs ] ♪♪ Yeah, my style of comedy is acerbic. It's self-deprecation, you know?

Mike Lawrence, everyone! Hey, Mike! [ Cheers and applause ] ♪♪ Oh, man. How's it going, everybody? Literally, as I was walking up here, a guy just goes, "Dude, you're [bleep] sick," and I'm like -- as a nerd, it's like, "I'm glad I get to entertain my oppressors now. Thanks for beating me up in high school and turning me into the comic I am now." Uh...I am married. I know that I am not in my wife's league. Whenever people meet us, no one ever goes, "Oh, so, how'd you meet her?" They always just go, "So, how did you find her?" And it's like, what am I supposed to say to that? "She was in a basement with her sisters, and I picked the youngest one." [ Laughter ] She's very politically active in this election season. Who's excited about the elections, everybody?! [ Scattered cheers ] And that's why we're in the problems we are. We did this to ourselves. Oh, man. Yeah. The most exciting race is Beto O'Rourke versus Ted Cruz. It's just tough for me because I believe in Beto's politics more, but I also always feel like I have to root for the ugly guy against the pretty boy. But I want Beto to win. But Ted Cruz -- Let's just talk about how punchable his face is for a second. Ted Cruz looks like the guy who has smelled a fart but is clearly the one who's also farting. Like, it looks like if Mrs. Doubtfire put man makeup on top of the Mrs. Doubtfire makeup. [ Laughter ] Thanks for coming to the Comedy Cellar, and don't forget to vote, everybody! Bye bye!
