ELEVATOR'S ON THE LEFT> Hi, I'm so sorry, I completely forgot about our appointment - I thought you had canceled. - I was supposed to call? No, I'm interviewing another nanny right now. I see. Can you wait a little bit? Please. Wait here, I'll call you shortly. Excuse me, Cida. You were talking about your conditions. Yes, I only take care of children up to 3 years old. This is the first stage of childhood, the most important for development. -After this time, I leave. -I see. But don't worry... It is normal for new mothers to feel insecure. I know the stages of pregnancy. What is normal and what is not. Are you alright? Do you want me to call your husband? No, it's just a cramp. It's over. All right, I have your address. I will take your offer into consideration and let you know. Please, think about it. It is the current market rate. Good morning, I wish you luck. Thank you. I see you studied as a nurse. That's right, in Santa Lucia. Did you finish your studies? No I didn't. Things got complicated. I had to leave, but I would like to finish them. You also looked after kids at school. -Do you like children? - Sure. Who doesn't? -Do you have children? No, I'm alone. All right. You have no experience as a nanny? No, but for seven years I took care of my grandmother. Until her death. Well... Listen, Clara. I need someone to live here with me. To help around here and cook. Aren't you looking for a nanny? Yes but... Until the baby is born, I need someone to take care of the house. I can't do everything alone. It is a very large apartment. But when you start taking care of the baby, I will hire someone to do these other tasks. Okay... You have not provided any references here. I haven't. Can I send them later? - You don't remember anyone? - No. Only... I have the number of Dona Am?lia. She is a lady I looked after. All right. Do?a Am?lia? Whats her number? Two, five... seven, eight... seven, nine... two, four... She's usually not home at this time. Hello? Do?a Am?lia? My name is Ana. Clara Macedo is with me. I would like to hire her, so I needed to verify your reference. What is your relationship to her. She asks me where the remote is. It is probably under the sofa. It always falls there. She tells me it's... Ok, I'll tell her. Thanks for the information. Goodbye. She wants you to come back and pay the rent. I'm sorry. She is the landlady. But I have other references that I can provide later. If you want. Clara... I'm sorry but... Since you do not come from any agency... Deep breath. And exhale slowly. Good. Very well. And now slowly exhale. Very good. You feel better? Yes, much better. Thank you. I'll go now. Clara... Can you cook? This is the TV room. My bedroom is at the end of the hall. There is a bathroom there. This will be the baby's room. It's not ready yet. It needs to be reorganized. The crib is not assembled. A disaster... It is scattered everywhere. I don't know this melody. It's old. Pretty. Yes. It was my grandfather's music box, passed to my father and now it's mine. Amazing that it still works. I need someone to accompany me all day. Someone discreet. I hate gossip. Let's go to the kitchen to discuss money. GOOD MANNERS Stormy night Raindrops outside They are a lullaby for me But a misfortune for the poor The freezing rain That falls more and stronger And invades their humble homes Filling the mud floor Quiet Tebaldo! Yes on this day that happened I denied my brother help How can I be happy now? Good evening! Do?a Am?lia. Where are my clothes? Right here, you can take them. But first, pay me the rent and give me the remote. I found a job. Not around here. It is near the city center. Tomorrow I will pay you part, and the rest on the fifteenth. The lady needs help now, so she hired me immediately. All right. We'll see if you keep this job, at least you'll have a place to stay. Okay, Clara. Take your clothes. But I'm keeping the microwave until you pay me. All right? All right. Ehhh, Theobald. I can not find tranquility Do?a Ana? I would have cooked something better, but you only have meat. I'll give you my credit card. You'd better do the shopping. Well, what do you think? Fine. I'll take care of the shopping. This is a big spoon. For the soup, do you want a teaspoon? Do you know the rules of etiquette? What do you mean? Because of the spoon? My mother forced me to learn good manners. In a course for girls. One of the exercises consisted of eating soup without slurping. Another was to improve posture. The teacher puts a book on our heads... And to check... We had to walk with the book on our heads. As you can see, it didn't help. Can you turn on the fireplace? Just press the green button. Goodnight. These are the kidneys. And the little spine. Eyes... Nose... Mouth... It was just a kick. Do you want to know sex? I do not know. Well, ok. See that? It's a boy. He weighs about 420 grams. And his heart rate is 150. -Is that normal? -Yes. It is week 20 and weight is above average. The pains you feel are normal. Your body is getting ready. Center, unique as you.> - Can they be exchanged? - Yes, within 30 days. They fit very well. Will you have them in black? Tarsila? I did not know you were in Sao Paulo! Hello, Ana. -Thank you. -You're welcome. See you soon. -I'll take them. -Okay. Put the old shoes in the box. I'll wear the new ones. -Are you okay? -Yes Will that be credit or debit card? Credit. Authorization error. Swipe it again? Try this one. Beautiful shoes. Clara! Where were you? Beer, Dona Ana? This is not good if you breastfeed. Hey, relax. Come on. Drink something with me. The landlord called. You did not pay the rent. A new blouse? Yes, I bought it at the mall. I like it. Someone called on the intercom. He said there would be a community meeting. Clara, have a drink with me. Today is my birthday! Today? 29 years old! My Saturn Cycle is closed. Finally! Drink. Just one. I toast your health, Dona Ana. Thank you, Mrs. Clara. Is this your family's farm? Eh? Yup. Me and my horse Pagode. My little Pagode. His eyes are beautiful. He looks thoughtful. Have you lived here long? I moved here in January. Do you miss them? What happened? I don't talk to them anymore. My father broke all contact with me. Nobody writes or calls me. I wrote to my brothers, but no one responded. Because? Stupid nonsense. I was going to get married in September. And then... This happened, and my father got angry. He brought me here, so that I could get rid of the baby. But I didn't. I do not know why, but I could not. I could not. I do not understand. Did the boy's father want him? A?cio, my fiance, is not the father. There was another man. When I told him I'm keeping it... He posted a statement on the internet. Cynical! Cynical with a capital "C"! So there's no reason to go back there. And I decided to stay here. At least this apartment is in my name. You shouldn't... pay attention to what people say or think. Ignore them. My father doesn't want to see me. Do you understand? He will get over it. He won't get over it, you do not know him. He will get past it. You just have to wait. And take care of yourself. I'm sorry, Clara. We get so emotional during pregnancy. It's apparently normal What am I doing here? I do not know... Sometimes I miss Pagode. He must miss me too. It's good to be with someone who likes you. Let's take a picture. All right. Wait. 28th week. Everything is going well. Except your blood pressure which is elevated. Clara, take her pressure on a daily basis. Ana, I'm changing your diet. It will be hard at the beginning, but over time you will notice an improvement. NO MEAT Already. I think he' s over here. This is for you. A book of baby names ? So you can think about it. Need anything else? I going out. No, I'll stay here and listen. All right. Good night. -Where are you going? -To a bar. Sure. Take the phone. Impossible to find a lighter in this giant purse. Do you have one? No purse or lighter. A woman who goes out without a purse? Can I sit down and find out what planet you come from? Joao, bring us two beers. So, where are you from? From far away. Gilda. Have we met before? You are a supervisor... in the Crystal Forest Gallery. Stop! Are you a clairvoyant? That's amazing! You are still wearing your ID badge. What an idiot! I'm so stupid. I hate it. I always forget about it. Finished. And what about you? Did you run away from your boss? I do not have to run away from anyone. You are so pretty! Hey, Gilda! Lets sing happy birthday! I'm here for a co-worker's birthday. I gotta go with them. But I invite you to come with me. I cannot. I have to get back home. At least, tell me your name. Clara. Ana? Do you want to lie down? Go back to bed. Did you sleep well? I had a strange dream. But I'm fine. I did not hear you come back. Was it late? No. I came home early. Did you have fun? At the bar? A little too expensive. But the place itself was nice. Joel. What? The name for the baby. It is a Biblical name. I didn't know. Really? Yes I chose it because it sounds good. I like it. Joel. I like it too. PREGNANCY JOURNAL SLEEPWALKING SLEEP DISTURBANCES Ana. Take it easy. -It was just a dream. -My God! What a nightmare. -I'll get you some water. -No, stay with me. Please. Now calm down. I dreamed... that my teeth fell out. Then, suddenly, I was alone in the forest. I was digging to bury my teeth. And digging and digging endlessly... Jesus... Do not ask me what is the best way out I've already suffered a lot for love Now I'm going to enjoy my life Cry, call me, beg for my kisses again Ask me for help Maybe I can rescue you Cry, call me, beg for my love Tell me please. Maybe one day I'll find her again Ana. Lunch is almost ready. You did not have to fall in love It was just for fun I warned you, love, I warned you Did you know that he wanted only one night of love I warned you, love, I warned you It will not be easy for you to be back in your hands Delicious! First class. -What did you do to your hand? -Nothing. I cut myself cooking. Tell me, what happened? What's wrong? You're looking strange at me. Ana, I have to tell you something. You suffer from some form of sleepwalking. You walked out of the apartment last night. But not all the time. A month ago, I saw it happen again. And this wound... You gave it to me. Did I hurt you? You went out last night too. This time on the street. -I am going crazy? -No. - Its because of pregnancy. - No! The pregnancy. And these nightmares. They say it's normal, but it happens to me every month. -Four nights in a row. -Relax. Dr. Ciro said I should have someone by my side. Do not panic. It doesn't bring anything good. And its not good for the baby either. When I took care of my grandmother, I learned some things. She wasn't a doctor, but she knew how to deal with people. She told me that during full moons The baby is always restless. And the water in the womb, is like sea water. There's no full moon tonight. We will do a test. Thanks to the flour, we'll know if you get up tonight. Good night. Is everything alright? You're okay. Good morning. Sleep on Earth Sleep in the hay Sleep my little horse You only lived one day Run through the meadow Run for... Run my little horse Because this world is so big Night has fallen The world covered in a dark mantle Better go to sleep baby Sleep in the hammock Sleep... in the cradle Sleep my boy. So you will not feel thirsty If you're afraid Say my name Sleep my boy. That way you will not feel hungry I do not remember it well. You can keep the money left over from the accounts. Pay Dona Amelia. Are you kidding? You need to think about the baby. No, do not overdo it. You can't manage money well. Ana... Why do you have a gun? I know you keep one in the drawer. In the countryside, to protect against wild animals. But here we are not in the countryside. I got used to having a weapon. Have you ever killed an animal? Of course. When was the last time? I remember the last time I fired it. Yup? Yup. During a vacation in Goi?s Velho. My friends left me, but I went out anyway. At the end of the night, I was up on the top of a hill, in a kind of saloon... It was there that I met him. Jorge M?rio. We got in the car and went to "Macaco Hill". And there... we did it. Then I fell asleep. I was woken up by a growl. Jorge had disappeared. The animal, it looked at me and then escaped into the forest. It's eyes... they shone in the dark... gazing furiously. And the boy? I have not seen him again... Never more. I tried to find him when I found out I was pregnant. But nobody... Nobody knew him in the city. He is huge... Big eyes. Big mouth. Big hands. He's very robust, Ana. Even your weight is perfect. You can eat the corn cakes, from the San Juan festival. But no wine. I'm prescribing you a tranquilizer for insomnia. Take half a pill. It's normal to feel like this. You are in the final phase. Can I give her meat again? No. Do you know what I want? -Do you have a craving? -Yes What is it? Peanuts. You can't. They're not good for the baby. I can not sleep if I do not snack a little. -They have to toast them. -No, they are already done. I should not leave you alone. It's not that far. Alright. I'll hurry up. Thank you. It's my job. Breathe, Ana. Exhale. Calm. I'll call Dr. Ciro. Dr. Ciro's answering machine Care lady Accelerate the pace The street is dark A little beyond All kinds of creatures They hide in the night Woman that you run Get out of my sight It will be better than that child Do not cry Hold it tight against you While crossing to the other side Walk straight And forget your fear Do not look back It's the advice we give you Never look back It's the advice we give you In my body I carry Your blood, your clothes What will be of my life?

Hi, Joel. How are you? Good morning! I thought you would not come. I'm sorry, Do?a Norma. Joel has been sick. We didn?t sleep well. It's nice to have a nurse mom. Right, Joel? You will always be well taken care of. Amanda, honey! A friend is waiting for you. -Hi. -Hello. She wants to ask him to accompany her to school dance for San Juan. He is still weak. He really shouldn't go. That would be a shame. Clara, give your son a little freedom. He never gets out. Can you eat a piece of cake today? No. Probably not. My mom told me we are celebrating alone. Then I'll give you my present now. I made it myself. Luiz. Marco. Maur?cio. Maur?cio you have improved. Very good. Natalie. Where's Natalia? Do not worry. It was very difficult. Yesterday I went with my father downtown, on the other side of the river. When I turn ten, he will teach me how to drive. Fantastic! What is that? Mortadella. Have you ever tried it? No thanks. How do you eat those things? They are healthy. Eat them, then. Do you want some? No way! The San Juan party will be fantastic. One hundred twenty... So my pressure is 120/80. Do you understand? More or less. -I'll write it down. -Thank you. Wanna hang out, and get something to eat? No, I have things to do at home. -You don't like hanging out, Do you? -It's difficult with a child. Look, I have a spaghetti arm! Maur?cio, let's go. Get in. I'm in a hurry. I have client waiting. The Pope? It's Joel's birthday. Happy birthday. -Thank you. -Take one, as a present. See you tomorrow! Joel! Clara! Come help me! What does she want now? Happy Birthday! On this day of celebration, lots of health and happiness. Happy Birthday to You! Make a wish, Joel. But don't have to tell anyone. Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday darling. - You remembered. - Of course I remembered it! I made a meat stew. No! He can't! He has an allergy. The boy needs protein, Clara. Eat slowly. Slowly, be careful with your tooth. Yup. Son, it's time to go into the room. Come on, Joel. -What's my height? How much? -Just a moment. Here it is. 7 YEARS See how much you've grown. Soon I will be taller than Maur?cio. Who gave it to you? Amanda, for my birthday. -I'll gave it back later, okay? -Good. Too tight? -See this? -Yes. Don't bite them. That's why your tooth hurts. Try not to bite, okay? Good night. Wait! Mom. Do you know what would be great? If I could go to the school party with Amanda. Will you let me? Joel... -When's the party? -Friday. But on Friday there is still a full moon. You need to be in the small room. I'm never allowed to do anything. You have to wait a little longer. It will be over soon. Good night. You did not have to fall in love It was just for fun I warned you Love, I warned you Did you know that I wanted Only one night of love Are you having lunch now? Good morning. Good morning. How is your tooth? What tooth? The one that hurts. Which? You don't remember? The one behind. It doesn't hurt anymore. Do you remember biting the chain? I think... I do not remember. Can you tell me the story of the river? Again? Yes. Once upon a time there was a river, that flowed under a large bridge. And one day a beautiful baby named Joel... appeared on the shore. It was a wonderful night. The full moon shone, and reflected in the water. I was coming home, when he heard a cry in the distance. I went to the shore and found a baby, wrapped in a blue blanket. He cried loudly. He was hungry He clung to life. There was no note? No, just the child. Who left me there? I do not know. It could have been the stork. Or maybe Coco, the boogeyman. I only know that for me it was a gift. You were weak this morning. Do?a Am?lia will take care of you while I work at pharmacy. Do not go out. All right? Lunch is in the fridge. Good boy. Perfect. Very good. Excellent. Here, very good. That is enough for today. You know it. What's wrong? I'm tired. Did you have breakfast? A bit of bread. Just bread, Joel? This is not a proper diet. I cannot eat that. Of course you can. You will feel better. It is tasty and healthy. Just do not tell mom. It will be our secret, ok? -It smells good. -It's delicious, you'll like it. Eat up. Chew well. Joel? Do you feel better? Where is Do?a Am?lia? Who is she? You went through my things. I had forbid you. I saw you hide the picture. I look like her, just like Mauricio resembles his father. You're a liar! You know who she is. Son, I was going to tell you when you've grown up. Liar! Tell me the truth! What else are you hiding from me? She's dead, Joel. -When were you born... -Do not joke! Calm down, I've never seen you like this. I'm telling you the truth. I'm not allowed to do anything! I have to sleep and eat when you tell me! -I'm sick of the small room! -Get a hold of yourself, Joel. -And I won't eat your food anymore! -Shut up! Go to the small room now! I'm not going! You will listen, I am your mother. You are not my mother! I am not going! You'll do as you are told! You will obey me! COMMERCIAL GALLERY CRYSTAL FOREST What happened today? What did you say to Joel? Me, Clara? Nothing. You left him alone, even though he was sick? He got better. He felt strong and healthier He even studied for his English test. I had a rehearsal, then I came here. This morning he was not like that. Something happened. He has changed a lot. What did you do Dona Am?lia? I fed him. -What? -A steak. It was just one... I thought it would do him good. And I was right. He stopped feeling weak. Clara... The child feels sick once a month. He gets sick every month. You need to take him to a doctor. Joel! What do you want? We wanted to see how Joel is. He's fine. He already went to bed. We want to give him something. For tomorrow's presentation at school. I don't know if he's going to school tomorrow. It depends on how he feels. Can you give him this, please? Thanks, Maur?cio. Thanks, Amanda. Good night. Come on, Amanda. Maur?cio brought this for you. Everything I do is to protect you. One day you won't have to sleep here alone. But it's still too early. What was her name? Your mother's name was Ana. She had a very good heart. She liked to dance. Like you. And she was very beautiful. Like you. Where did she live? Near the bridge. On the other side. How did she die? I will tell you everything when you are older. My father?

Here is my number. Please leave a message, I'll be in touch. Do not worry. When they are hungry, they'll come home. Amanda, did you talk to Joel today? Did he say anything? No, did something happen? Go to sleep, Amanda. Tomorrow you have to get up early. Clara, what about the police? They can ask for information from hospitals and other places. No, that is not necessary. Good evening.

Crystal Forest thanks you for your visit. Good evening. - I think she's back. - Good! Clara! You have a visitor. Angela? I tried calling you... I couldn't close the register. It requires a code. You didn't close it? You said you were coming back. I haven't done it alone. Go back, close the register and put the money in the safe. The password is 2306. - Okay, 23... - 06! You need to do it alone. That's why I trained you. I am not your guardian 24 hours a day! Clara, are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Ok... I'm going. Thanks, Do?a... What happened, Clara? Where's Joel?

Where were you yesterday? With Maur?cio. Where? We went looking for my father. Took the train. Maur?cio knew the way. It was very far. How did you get back? How did you come back, Joel? I do not remember. I had a very strange dream. About Maur?cio. He had a sword. Can l call him? Drink this and let's go. I'm not hungry in the morning. Only at night. In the small room, I feel hunger in there. If you leave me food there, I will eat it. I'm always hungry at night. -Where are we going? -We're leaving. -Why? -We cannot stay here. -Why? -That's enough! Now, come on, let's go! I don't want to! We're leaving now! I hate you! Joel. Are you ready? I want to take these lights. Joel? Open the door. Joel. Open the door immediately. Open the door, Joel! Hello, Clara? I'm worried. I would like to know if everything went well last night. Call me please. There was blood everywhere. In the elevator and on the roof. But I did not see any bodies. Just blood everywhere. The police have not confirmed the story yet. But they are not letting anyone into the center. Hey, Joel. How are you? Did your mother punish you yesterday? Because you disappeared. Yes, she did. What did you do? Nothing. We were just playing. Who are you going to the dance with? I do not know. Two guys asked me to go. Did you lose my present? Would you like to go with me? Will your mother let you go? Clara? Clara? Are you in there? Angela!?! Thank you. Joel? Where's Joel? What do you mean? What happened? Who locked you up in there? I think I know where he went. Joel, concentrate. Keep your hat on your head. It's raining! The dance prepared by our students And there will also be a wedding. A great party in which the priest will also participate. Clara! Did you find Joel? Yes thanks. Maur?cio has not returned home. The money was still on the table. He must be somewhere. You were right. Children are always playing around. -And now kneel. -Okay. This is my favorite part. Of course, because you don't do anything. Let's Dance! Joel, let's go. The dance is starting soon. Joel, are you okay? Let go, it hurts! Go away... Get out of here!
